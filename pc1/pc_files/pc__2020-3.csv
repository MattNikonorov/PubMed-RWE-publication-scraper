Facts and Facets""","""Purpose:   It is projected that approximately 50,000 new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed in 2020 in India. Survival has improved because of the development of effective drugs such as abiraterone acetate, but universal accessibility to treatment is not always possible because of cost constraints in lower- and middle-income countries. Recently, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) has included low-dose abiraterone (250 mg/day) with food as an alternative treatment option to full-dose abiraterone (1,000 mg/day) fasting.  Methods:   The Science and Cost Cancer Consortium conducted a survey to evaluate the use of abiraterone in India and the opinions of medical oncologists about using low-dose treatment. Modeling was used to estimate potential financial benefits to individual patients and to estimate overall costs of health care in India if low-dose abiraterone is prescribed.  Results:   Of 251 Indian medical oncologists who were invited to participate in the survey, 125 provided their e-mail address and received the survey; 118 responded (47% of the total). Of these, 25% were not aware of the recent NCCN recommendation, 55% were already prescribing low-dose abiraterone when resources were limited, 7% had already changed their practice, and 29% agreed to switch to a universal practice of using low-dose abiraterone with food; 9% of practitioners would not use low-dose abiraterone. Estimated mean per patient savings was US$3,640, with annual savings of US$182 million in India.  Conclusion:   Use of lower-dose abiraterone would increase access to treatment in India and globally and lead to large cost savings.""","""['Amol Patel', 'Ian F Tannock', 'Priyanka Srivastava', 'Bivas Biswas', 'Vineet Govinda Gupta', 'Atul Batra', 'Sainath Bhethanabhotla', 'Raja Pramanik', 'Shubh Mahindru', 'Tvsvgk Tilak', 'Chandan Krishna Das', 'Prashant Mehta']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""JCO Glob Oncol""","""['Low-Dose Abiraterone, a Rare European Commodity.', 'Potential Cost Savings With Low-Dose Abiraterone in the United States.', 'Economic Outcomes in Patients with Chemotherapy-Naïve Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Treated with Enzalutamide or Abiraterone Acetate Plus Prednisone.', 'Budgetary impact on a U.S. health plan adopting abiraterone acetate plus prednisone for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Cost-Savings Analysis of AR-V7 Testing in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Eligible for Treatment With Abiraterone or Enzalutamide.', 'Cabazitaxel for Hormone-Relapsed Metastatic Prostate Cancer Previously Treated With a Docetaxel-Containing Regimen: An Evidence Review Group Perspective of a NICE Single Technology Appraisal.', 'Oral formulation strategies to improve the bioavailability and mitigate the food effect of abiraterone acetate.', 'Prognostic impact of dose reduction in androgen receptor pathway inhibitors for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Priorities for cancer research in low- and middle-income countries: a global perspective.', 'Alternative trastuzumab dosing strategies in HER2-positive early breast cancer are associated with patient out-of-pocket savings.', 'Clinical research in oncology: in memory of Professor Gordon McVie.', 'Analysis of Clinical Trials on Therapies for Prostate Cancer in Mainland China and Globally from 2010 to 2020.']"""

One way to overcome these limitations-and improve their efficacy-is to use ""stealth"" macromolecular carriers that evade uptake by the reticuloendothelial system. Although unstructured polypeptides are of increasing interest as macromolecular drug carriers, current recombinant polypeptides in the clinical pipeline typically lack stealth properties. We address this challenge by developing new unstructured polypeptides, called zwitterionic polypeptides (ZIPPs), that exhibit ""stealth"" behavior in vivo. We show that conjugating paclitaxel to a ZIPP imparts amphiphilicity to the polypeptide chain that is sufficient to drive its self-assembly into micelles. This in turn increases the half-life of paclitaxel by 17-fold compared to free paclitaxel, and by 1.6-fold compared to the nonstealth control, i.e., ELP-paclitaxel. Treatment of mice bearing highly aggressive prostate or colon cancer with a single dose of ZIPP-paclitaxel nanoparticles leads to near-complete eradication of the tumor, and these nanoparticles have a wider therapeutic window than Abraxane, an FDA-approved taxane nanoformulation.""","""['Samagya Banskota', 'Soumen Saha', 'Jayanta Bhattacharya', 'Nadia Kirmani', 'Parisa Yousefpour', 'Michael Dzuricky', 'Nikita Zakharov', 'Xinghai Li', 'Ivan Spasojevic', 'Kenneth Young', 'Ashutosh Chilkoti']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Nano Lett""","""['A paclitaxel-loaded recombinant polypeptide nanoparticle outperforms Abraxane in multiple murine cancer models.', 'A docetaxel-carboxymethylcellulose nanoparticle outperforms the approved taxane nanoformulation, Abraxane, in mouse tumor models with significant control of metastases.', 'Long circulating genetically encoded intrinsically disordered zwitterionic polypeptides for drug delivery.', 'Efficient delivery of therapeutic agents by using targeted albumin nanoparticles.', 'Nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (ABI-007): a newer taxane alternative in breast cancer.', 'Advanced strategies to evade the mononuclear phagocyte system clearance of nanomaterials.', 'Adipose Tissue-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Contribute to Phenotypic Plasticity of Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Smart drug delivery systems for precise cancer therapy.', 'Genetically Engineered Nanoparticles of Asymmetric Triblock Polypeptide with a Platinum(IV) Cargo Outperforms a Platinum(II) Analog and Free Drug in a Murine Cancer Model.', 'Supramolecular nanomedicines through rational design of self-assembling prodrugs.']"""

Materials and methods:   Testicular doses in 40 intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer patients were determined on treatment planning system (TPS) using the VMAT technique at 6 MV. Scattered testicular doses were also measured by MOSFET detectors placed on testis surface. The testicular doses of patients treated with prostate-only and pelvic field irradiation were compared.  Results:   The median testicular doses measured per 200 cGy fraction by TPS and MOSFET detectors were 1.7 cGy (0.7-4.1 cGy) and 4.8 cGy (3.6-8.8 cGy), respectively. The TPS doses and MOSFET readings showed a significant strong correlation (Pearson r = 0.848, p < 0.001). The testicular doses measured by TPS (1.34 ± 0.36 cGy vs. 2.60 ± 0.95 cGy; p < 0.001) and MOSFET (4.52 ± 0.64 cGy vs. 6.56 ± 1.23 cGy; p < 0.001) were significantly lower in patients with prostate-only irradiation than in those with pelvic field irradiation. The mean cumulative scattered dose for prostate-only field delivering 78 Gy was 1.8 Gy and that for pelvic field irradiation was 2.6 Gy, consistent with the reported findings.  Conclusions:   The patients with prostate-only irradiation received lower testicular doses than those with additional pelvic field irradiation possibly due to the increased scattered doses in large field irradiation using the VMAT technique. The clinical response to increased incidental testicular doses due to pelvic field irradiation remains unknown, and it warrants further investigation.""","""['Cem Onal', 'Recep Bozca', 'Yemliha Dolek', 'Ozan Cem Guler', 'Gungor Arslan']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Radiol Med""","""['Evaluation of incidental testicular dose with thermoluminescence dosimetry during prostate radiotherapy.', 'Dosimetric analysis of testicular doses in prostate intensity-modulated and volumetric-modulated arc radiation therapy at different energy levels.', 'Comparison of testicular dose delivered by intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in patients with prostate cancer.', 'The Impact of Pelvic Nodal Radiotherapy on Hematologic Toxicity: A Systematic Review with Focus on Leukopenia, Lymphopenia and Future Perspectives in Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'A systematic review of radiation-induced testicular toxicities following radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Integration between Novel Imaging Technologies and Modern Radiotherapy Techniques: How the Eye Drove the Chisel.', 'Imaging side effects and complications of chemotherapy and radiation therapy: a pictorial review from head to toe.']"""

We assessed whether the model predicted prostate cancer metastasis or death in men not subject to prostate specific antigen screening.  Materials and methods:   The cohort includes 43,692 unscreened prostate cancer-free men from a Swedish population based cohort with low rates of prostate specific antigen screening (Västerbotten Intervention Project). Using cryopreserved blood collected at ages 50 and 60 years from men in this cohort we analyzed the association between prostate specific antigen and other kallikrein marker levels in blood and risk of prostate cancer metastasis or death.  Results:   There were 308 with metastases and 172 prostate cancer deaths. Baseline prostate specific antigen was strongly associated with 20-year risk of prostate cancer death (c-index at age 50, 0.859, 95% CI 0.799-0.916; age 60, 0.840, 95% CI 0.799-0.878). Men 60 years old with prostate specific antigen below median (less than 1.2 ng/ml) had 0.4% risk of prostate cancer death at 20 years. Among men with moderately elevated prostate specific antigen (2.0 ng/ml or greater) the 4Kscore markedly improved discrimination (c-index 0.767 vs 0.828 and 0.774 vs 0.862 in men age 50 and 60, respectively). Long-term risk of prostate cancer death or metastasis in men with low 4Kscores was very low.  Conclusions:   Screening should focus on men in top prostate specific antigen quartile at age 60 years. Men with elevated prostate specific antigen but a low 4Kscore can safely be monitored with repeated blood markers in place of immediate biopsy.""","""['Emily A Vertosick', 'Christel Häggström', 'Daniel D Sjoberg', 'Göran Hallmans', 'Robert Johansson', 'Andrew J Vickers', 'Pär Stattin', 'Hans Lilja']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Twenty-year Risk of Prostate Cancer Death by Midlife Prostate-specific Antigen and a Panel of Four Kallikrein Markers in a Large Population-based Cohort of Healthy Men.', 'Improving the Specificity of Screening for Lethal Prostate Cancer Using Prostate-specific Antigen and a Panel of Kallikrein Markers: A Nested Case-Control Study.', 'A Four-kallikrein Panel Predicts High-grade Cancer on Biopsy: Independent Validation in a Community Cohort.', '4-Kallikrein Test and Kallikrein Markers in Prostate Cancer Screening.', 'PSA and blood test diagnostics of prostate cancer.', 'Predictive value of kallikrein forms and β-microseminoprotein in blood from patients with evidence of detectable levels of PSA after radical prostatectomy.', 'Effect of Bicalutamide Combined with Docetaxel on Serum PSA and VEGF Levels in Patients with Advanced Prostate Carcinoma.', 'Are polygenic risk scores ready for the cancer clinic?-a perspective.', 'Prostate cancer polygenic risk score and prediction of lethal prostate cancer.', 'Population-based randomized trial of screening for clinically significant prostate cancer ProScreen: a pilot study.']"""

Increased expression of the enzyme aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3) is phenotypic of CRPC. The enzyme acts to circumvent castration by producing potent androgens that drive proliferation. Furthermore, AKR1C3 mediates chemotherapeutic resistance to the standard of care, enzalutamide, a structural analogue of apalutamide. Resistance develops in almost all CRPC patients within three months of beginning treatment. Herein, we report that both apalutamide and the structurally distinct darolutamide induce AKR1C3 expression in in vitro models of prostate cancer and are susceptible to AKR1C3-mediated resistance. This effect is countered by pretreatment with a potent and highly selective AKR1C3 inhibitor, sensitizing high AKR1C3 expressing prostate cancer cell lines to the action of both chemotherapeutics with a concomitant reduction in expression of AKR1C3 and the biomarker prostate-specific antigen.""","""['Ahmed Morsy', 'Paul C Trippier']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""ACS Chem Biol""","""['AKR1C3 Inhibitor KV-37 Exhibits Antineoplastic Effects and Potentiates Enzalutamide in Combination Therapy in Prostate Adenocarcinoma Cells.', 'Cross-Resistance Among Next-Generation Antiandrogen Drugs Through the AKR1C3/AR-V7 Axis in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', '11-Oxygenated androgen precursors are the preferred substrates for aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3): Implications for castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Aldo-Keto Reductase (AKR) 1C3 inhibitors: a patent review.', 'Overall survival and adverse events after treatment with darolutamide vs. apalutamide vs. enzalutamide for high-risk non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.', 'Discovery of Novel Aldo-Keto Reductase 1C3 Inhibitors as Chemotherapeutic Potentiators for Cancer Drug Resistance.', 'Intracrine androgen biosynthesis and drug resistance.', 'Access to Highly Strained Tricyclic Ketals Derived from Coumarins.', 'Aldo-Keto Reductases and Cancer Drug Resistance.', 'Resistance to second-generation androgen receptor antagonists in prostate cancer.']"""

In prostate cancer (PCa) progression, increased expression levels of SNAIL and SLUG have been described. In advanced PCa, a decrease in the cell surface proteoglycan syndecan‑1 (SDC‑1), which has a role in cell‑to‑extracellular matrix adhesion, has been observed. Notably, SDC‑1 nuclear location has been observed in mesenchymal cancers. The present study aimed to determine if SNAIL and SLUG may be associated with the nuclear location of SDC‑1 in PCa. To determine the location of SDC‑1, antibodies against its intracellular domain (ID) or extracellular domain (ED) were used in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and PCa samples with high Gleason scores. Only ID‑SDC‑1 was located in the cell nuclei in advanced PCa samples, but not in the BPH samples. ED‑SDC‑1 was located in the cell membrane and cytoplasm, exhibiting decreased levels in PCa in comparison with those in BPH. Furthermore, LNCaP and PC3 PCa cell lines with ectopic SNAIL expression exhibited nuclear ID‑SDC‑1. No change was observed in the ED‑SDC‑1 levels, and maintained its location in the cell membrane and cytoplasm. SLUG induced no change in ID‑SDC‑1 location. At the protein level, an association between SNAIL and nuclear ID‑SDC‑1 was observed. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that nuclear ID‑SDC‑1 localization was associated with SNAIL expression in PCa cell lines.""","""['Nancy Farfán', 'Octavio Orellana-Serradell', 'Daniela Herrera', 'Dominique Chrzanowsky', 'Paulina Cubillos', 'Gabriel Marín', 'Antonio Antonio García De Herreros', 'Enrique A Castellón', 'Héctor R Contreras']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Mol Med""","""['The transcriptional factor ZEB1 represses Syndecan 1 expression in prostate cancer.', 'Increased SNAIL expression and low syndecan levels are associated with high Gleason grade in prostate cancer.', 'Skp2 and Slug Are Coexpressed in Aggressive Prostate Cancer and Inhibited by Neddylation Blockade.', 'Targeting the SPOCK1-snail/slug axis-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by apigenin contributes to repression of prostate cancer metastasis.', 'Examination of CK2α and NF-κB p65 expression in human benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer tissues.', 'HS, an Ancient Molecular Recognition and Information Storage Glycosaminoglycan, Equips HS-Proteoglycans with Diverse Matrix and Cell-Interactive Properties Operative in Tissue Development and Tissue Function in Health and Disease.', 'The Role and Therapeutic Value of Syndecan-1 in Cancer Metastasis and Drug Resistance.', 'Nuclear Syndecan-1 Regulates Epithelial-Mesenchymal Plasticity in Tumor Cells.', 'What Are the Potential Roles of Nuclear Perlecan and Other Heparan Sulphate Proteoglycans in the Normal and Malignant Phenotype.', 'Syndecan-1 (CD138), Carcinomas and EMT.']"""

Patients and methods:   A total of 850 patients underwent RP by a single surgeon. All patients had preoperative testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin levels determined; free testosterone was calculated prospectively. In all, 152 (18%) patients with low preoperative calculated free testosterone (cFT) levels and delayed postoperative sexual function recovery were placed on TRT and proportionately matched to 419 control patients by pathological Gleason Grade Group (GGG) and stage. Rates and time to BCR [two consecutive prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels of ≥0.2 ng/mL] were compared in univariate and multivariate regression; Cox regression was used to generate a survival function at the mean of covariates.  Results:   The median follow-up was 3.5 years. There were no statistically significant differences in demographics or general health complications between groups. BCR occurred in 11/152 (7.2%) and 53/419 (12.6%) patients in the TRT and control groups, respectively. In adjusted time-to-event analysis, TRT was an independent predictor of recurrence-free survival. After accounting for GGG, pathological stage, preoperative PSA level, and cFT, patients on TRT were ~54% less likely to recur (hazard ratio 0.54, 95% confidence interval 0.292-0.997). In men destined to recur, TRT delayed time to recurrence by an average of 1.5 years.  Conclusion:   In our experience, TRT after RP significantly reduced BCR and delayed time to BCR. There was no identifiable general health complications associated with TRT.

Administrative hospital data were then used to categorize the type of prostate biopsy and subsequent complications requiring hospital admission. Administrative hospital data were used to identify patients staying overnight immediately after biopsy and those readmitted separately for hospital admissions because of sepsis, urinary retention or haematuria. Procedure-related mortality and total length of hospital stay within 30 days were also recorded. Generalized linear models were used to calculate adjusted risk differences (aRDs).  Results:   A total of 73 630 patients undergoing prostate biopsy were identified. Those undergoing TP biopsy (n = 13 723) were more likely to have an overnight hospital stay (12.3% vs 2.4%; aRD 9.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 7.1-12.3), were less likely to be readmitted because of sepsis (1.0% vs 1.4%; aRD -0.4%, CI -0.6 to -0.2), and were more likely to be readmitted with urinary retention (1.9% vs 1.0%; aRD 1.1%, CI 0.7-1.4) than those undergoing a TR biopsy (n = 59 907). There were no significant differences in the risk of haematuria or mortality.  Conclusions:   Our results showed that TP biopsy had a lower risk of readmission for sepsis but a higher risk of readmission for urinary retention than TR biopsy.

A significant reduction in symptoms and improvement in urinary flow was observed (p < 0.0001) at all assessment points: IPSS-score and QoL improved to 8.51 ± 5.51 and 1.76 ± 1.32, respectively; and Qmax increased to 16.00 ± 7.43 ml/s. None of the patients who were previously sexually active reported a deterioration in sexual or ejaculatory functions according to two yes/no questions over the follow-up period. Excluding the patients lost at follow-up, five patients underwent surgery between 12 and 24 months. Upon investigation, it was discovered that four of the five patients requiring surgery had median lobes and were protocol deviators. A failure analysis was carried out for all 81 patients in order to identify baseline parameters that could predict treatment failure. 58.33% of patients in the failure group (7 out of 12) had median lobes which was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.0001). None of the other preoperative variables (age, prostate volume, IPSS scores, Qmax, PVR, and PSA) were found to predict response to iTind treatment.  Conclusion:   iTind treatment for BPO-related LUTS showed marked and durable reduction in symptoms and improvement of functional parameters and quality of life at 24 months of follow-up. It was found that median lobe may predict failure of iTind treatment. According to the yes/no questions, ejaculatory and sexual functions do not seem to be effected following treatment, however, this finding must be supported with further studies using the accepted tools.""","""['Gregor Kadner', 'Massimo Valerio', 'Ioannis Giannakis', 'Arya Manit', 'Nicolaas Lumen', 'Brian S H Ho', 'Sergio Alonso', 'Claude Schulman', 'Neil Barber', 'Daniele Amparore', 'Francesco Porpiglia']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Second-generation of temporary implantable nitinol device for the relief of lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia: results of a prospective, multicentre study at 1 year of follow-up.', '3-Year results following treatment with the second generation of the temporary implantable nitinol device in men with LUTS secondary to benign prostatic obstruction.', 'Urinary and sexual function after treatment with temporary implantable nitinol device (iTind) in men with LUTS: 6-month interim results of the MT-06-study.', ""What's New in TIND?"", 'Minimally Invasive Therapies for Benign Prostatic Obstruction: A Review of Currently Available Techniques Including Prostatic Artery Embolization, Water Vapor Thermal Therapy, Prostatic Urethral Lift, Temporary Implantable Nitinol Device and Aquablation.', 'Real-world Early Outcomes and Retreatment Rates Following Water Vapour Ablative Therapy for Symptomatic Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.', 'Pharmacological and interventional treatment of benign prostatic obstruction: An evidence-based comparative review.', 'iTIND for BPH: Technique and procedural outcomes: A narrative review of current literature.', 'Minimally invasive treatment options for the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'New Ultra-minimally Invasive Surgical Treatment for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: A Systematic Review and Analysis of Comparative Outcomes.']"""

This study investigated the association between spironolactone use and PCa risk. For comparison, we also examined associations with thiazide diuretics which do not have anti-androgenic properties.  Methods:   A matched case-control study was undertaken using population-wide data from the Prostate Cancer Data Base Sweden (PCBaSe). All PCa cases diagnosed from 2014 to 2016 were matched by birth year and county with PCa-free controls selected from the general population (1:5). Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to examine associations between spironolactone use (dose and duration) and PCa risk, and similarly for thiazides.  Results:   Three percent of the 31,591 cases and 4% of the 156,802 controls had been prescribed spironolactone. Multivariable analyses indicated reduced risk of PCa among those ever exposed to spironolactone (odds ratio [OR] 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.76-0.89), with a stronger association for current users (OR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.69-0.86) than past users (OR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.79-0.97) and decreasing risk with increasing dose (p-trend < 0.001). No association was observed for thiazide exposure and PCa risk. Biases due to differences in prescribing patterns or frequency of PSA testing may have influenced these findings.  Conclusion:   PCa risk was reduced among men exposed to the diuretic spironolactone.

We examined effects of phenelzine (a monoamine oxidase inhibitor) in patients with biochemical recurrent castrate-sensitive prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   An open-label single arm clinical trial enrolled subjects with biochemical recurrent prostate cancer defined by PSA ≥ 0.4 ng/ml (post prostatectomy) or PSA ≥ 2 ng/ml above nadir (post-radiation therapy); no evidence of metastasis on imaging; and normal androgen levels. Subjects received phenelzine 30 mg orally twice daily. Mood symptoms were assessed with the hospital anxiety depression score (HADS) questionnaire. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a PSA decline of ≥50% from baseline.  Results:   Characteristics of the 20 eligible patients enrolled included: mean ± SD age 66.9 ± 4.8 years and PSA 4.7 ± 5.8 ng/dl. Maximal PSA declines ≥30% and ≥50% were observed in 25% (n = 5/20) and 10% (n = 2/20) of subjects, respectively. At 12 weeks, 17 subjects remained on treatment with PSA declines ≥30% and ≥50% of 24% (n = 4/17) and 6% (n = 1/17), respectively. Common toxicities observed included dizziness (grade 1 = 45%, grade 2 = 35%), hypertension (grade ≥ 2 = 30%), and edema (grade 1 = 25%, grade 2 = 10%). There was one episode of grade 4 hypertension (cycle 4) and two episodes of grade 3 syncope (cycle 12 and cycle 14) requiring treatment discontinuation. HADS questionnaires demonstrated a significant decrease in anxiety with no change in depressive symptoms on treatment.  Conclusions:   Phenelzine demonstrated efficacy in patients with biochemical recurrent castrate-sensitive prostate cancer.

Expression of genes associated with base excision repair (BER) is increased with prostate cancer progression and correlates with poor prognosis. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) are key enzymes in BER that elongate and degrade PAR polymers on target proteins. While PARP inhibitors have been tested in clinical trials and are a promising therapy for prostate cancer patients with TMPRSS2-ERG fusions and mutations in DNA repair genes, PARG inhibitors have not been evaluated. We show that PARG is a direct androgen receptor (AR) target gene. AR is recruited to the PARG locus and induces PARG expression. Androgen ablation combined with PARG inhibition synergistically reduces BER capacity in independently derived LNCaP and LAPC4 prostate cancer cell lines. A combination of PARG inhibition with androgen ablation or with the DNA damaging drug, temozolomide, significantly reduces cellular proliferation and increases DNA damage. PARG inhibition alters AR transcriptional output without changing AR protein levels. Thus, AR and PARG are engaged in reciprocal regulation suggesting that the success of androgen ablation therapy can be enhanced by PARG inhibition in prostate cancer patients.""","""['Manqi Zhang', 'Yanhao Lai', 'Judy L Vasquez', 'Dominic I James', 'Kate M Smith', 'Ian D Waddell', 'Donald J Ogilvie', 'Yuan Liu', 'Irina U Agoulnik']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Targeting poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase to draw apoptosis codes in cancer.', 'Inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 or poly(ADP‑ribose) glycohydrolase individually, but not in combination, leads to improved chemotherapeutic efficacy in HeLa cells.', 'Specific killing of DNA damage-response deficient cells with inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase.', 'Global analysis of transcriptional regulation by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 and poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells.', 'Poly(ADP-Ribose) Glycohydrolase (PARG) vs. Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase (PARP) - Function in Genome Maintenance and Relevance of Inhibitors for Anti-cancer Therapy.', 'Identification of PANoptosis-Based Prognostic Signature for Predicting Efficacy of Immunotherapy and Chemotherapy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'A genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen identifies novel PARP inhibitor resistance genes in prostate cancer.', 'Abiraterone In Vitro Is Superior to Enzalutamide in Response to Ionizing Radiation.', 'Base excision repair and its implications to cancer therapy.']"""

We sought to provide an overview of the expected incidence and mortality of cancer in Canada in 2020 in follow-up to the Canadian Cancer Statistics 2019 report.  Methods:   We obtained incidence data from the National Cancer Incidence Reporting System (1984-1991) and Canadian Cancer Registry (1992-2015). Mortality data (1984-2015) were obtained from the Canadian Vital Statistics - Death Database. All databases are maintained by Statistics Canada. Cancer incidence and mortality counts and age-standardized rates were projected to 2020 for 23 cancer types by sex and geographic region (provinces and territories) for all ages combined.  Results:   An estimated 225 800 new cancer cases and 83 300 cancer deaths are expected in Canada in 2020. The most commonly diagnosed cancers are expected to be lung overall (29 800), breast in females (27 400) and prostate in males (23 300). Lung cancer is also expected to be the leading cause of cancer death, accounting for 25.5% of all cancer deaths, followed by colorectal (11.6%), pancreatic (6.4%) and breast (6.1%) cancers. Incidence and mortality rates will be generally higher in the eastern provinces than in the western provinces.  Interpretation:   The number of cancer cases and deaths remains high in Canada and, owing to the growing and aging population, is expected to continue to increase. Although progress has been made in reducing deaths for most major cancers (breast, prostate and lung), there has been limited progress for pancreatic cancer, which is expected to be the third leading cause of cancer death in Canada in 2020. Additional efforts to improve uptake of existing programs, as well as to advance research, prevention, screening and treatment, are needed to address the cancer burden in Canada.""","""['Darren R Brenner', 'Hannah K Weir', 'Alain A Demers', 'Larry F Ellison', 'Cheryl Louzado', 'Amanda Shaw', 'Donna Turner', 'Ryan R Woods', 'Leah M Smith;Canadian Cancer Statistics Advisory Committee']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""CMAJ""","""['Projected estimates of cancer in Canada in 2022.', '1992 Canadian Cancer Statistics.', 'Long-term projections of cancer incidence and mortality in Canada: The OncoSim All Cancers Model.', 'Cancer incidence in Canada: trends and projections (1983-2032).', 'Cancer statistics, 2004.', 'Automated Detection of Anatomical Landmarks During Colonoscopy Using a Deep Learning Model.', 'Perceptions of Canadian Radiation Oncologists, Medical Physicists, and Radiation Trainees about the Feasibility and Need of Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) in Canada: A National Survey.', 'Does a multimodal prehabilitation program improve sleep quality and duration in patients undergoing colorectal resection for cancer?

We analyzed the effect of histology on lymph node metastases at nephrectomy and its effect on survival in a contemporary cohort of patients with nonmetastatic RCC.  Methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2004-2015), we identified 100,060 patients with clear-cell, papillary, chromophobe, sarcomatoid, and collecting duct RCC, who underwent nephrectomy with or without lymph node dissection for nonmetastatic RCC. Logistic regression models, cumulative incidence plots, and competing-risks regression models were performed.  Results:   Overall, 10,590 patients underwent lymph node dissection for nonmetastatic RCC. Of these, LNI was recorded in 52 (7.0%), 615 (8.7%), 282 (13.9%), 316 (25.1%), 129 (38.3%), 45 (71.4%) patients with chromophobe, clear-cell, nonotherwise specified RCC, papillary, sarcomatoid, and collecting duct RCC histological subtypes, respectively. In logistic regression models, relative to clear-cell, papillary Odds ratio (OR 3.9), sarcomatoid (OR 6.3), collecting duct (OR 14.6) but not chromophobe RCC (OR 0.9; P = 0.5) independently predicted LNI at surgery. Moreover, in competing-risks regression models, LNI increased the risk of CSM 1.8-fold for sarcomatoid, 3.6-fold for clear-cell, 4.1-fold for papillary, and 6.7-fold for chromophobe histological subtype.

Objective:   To determine the predictive factors for oncologic outcomes and complications after RARP in renal transplants recipients (RTRs).  Design and participants:   A retrospective multicenter controlled study identified all RTRs who had undergone RARP between 2008 and 2016 in 2 experts departments. All RTRs were matched 1:1 with patients who had also undergone RARP but with no history of renal transplant (control group).  Intervention:   Robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.  Outcome measurements:   Incontinence, oncologic outcomes, and complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification.  Statistical analysis:   Comparisons of the quantitative variables using Student's t tests, and comparisons of the qualitative variables using χ2 tests. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS (version 9.3). Independent risk factors of biochemical recurrence (BCR), postoperative complications, or incontinence were searched by using a multivariate linear regression.  Results:   Twenty-seven RTRs were included in the transplant group and compared with 27 men in the control group with similar preoperative characteristics. Univariate analysis showed a shorter BCR-free survival in RTRs, with 26.9 months vs 49.3 months in the control group (P = .018). BCR rate was similar in each group (7.4% vs 11.1%, P = .639). No difference between groups was showed for immediate postoperative complications (29.6% vs 22.2%, P = .279). Multivariate analysis showed that a renal graft history was an independent risk factor of shorter BCR-free survival (hazard ratio = 4.291; 95% confidence interval, 2.102-8.761 and P < .001). Even if it is the first comparative study on this topic, the low number of men included is the main limitation of our study.  Conclusions:   These findings show the reliability of RARP in RTRs. The rate of BCR does not appear more frequently but BCR-free survival seems shorter in these patients. A prospective comparative study remains necessary with more patients to confirm our results.""","""['Grégoire Léonard', 'Benjamin Pradère', 'Laure Monléon', 'Jean-Michel Boutin', 'Julien Branchereau', 'Georges Karam', 'Jérôme Rigaud', 'Franck Bruyère']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Transplant Proc""","""['Learning curve of minimally invasive radical prostatectomy: Comprehensive evaluation and cumulative summation analysis of oncological outcomes.', 'Laparoscopic and robot-assisted vs open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localized prostate cancer: a Cochrane systematic review.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting oncologic outcome after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Biochemical recurrence-free survival after robotic-assisted laparoscopic vs open radical prostatectomy for intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes between standard laparoscopic and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systemic review and meta-analysis.', 'Urological Cancers and Kidney Transplantation: a Literature Review.', 'Radical prostatectomy outcomes in renal transplant recipients: a retrospective case series of Thai patients.']"""

The health states were non-metastatic and metastatic BCR, non-metastatic and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and death. The state-transition probabilities and utilities associated with each health state were derived from the literature.

The NEVERMIND system comprises a smart shirt and a user interface, in the form of a mobile application. The system is a real-time decision support system, aiming to predict the severity and onset of depressive symptoms by modelling the well-being condition of patients based on physiological data, body movement, and the recurrence of social interactions. The study includes 330 patients who have a diagnosis of myocardial infarction, breast cancer, prostate cancer, kidney failure, or lower limb amputation. Participants are randomised in blocks of ten to either the NEVERMIND intervention or treatment as usual as the control group. Clinical interviews and structured questionnaires are administered at baseline, at 12 weeks, and 24 weeks to assess whether the NEVERMIND system is superior to treatment as usual.

Stem cell/oxygen-releasing HP system increased cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) level and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 3 (M3) expression while decreasing fibrosis and apoptosis in the corpus cavernosum. Our results clearly show that stem cell survival increases around transplanted stem cell/oxygen-releasing hybrid system site. Taken together, an oxygen-releasing HP system supported prolonged stem cell survival, sustaining the paracrine effect of the stem cells, and consequently enhancing erectile function. These findings show promise with regard to prolonged stem cell survival in stem cell applications for various diseases and types of tissue damage. Impact statement In this study, we used an oxygen-releasing hollow microparticles (HPs) system with stem cells to attempt to overcome certain limitations of stem cell therapy, including insufficient nutrient and oxygen supplies for transplanted stem cells. Our results demonstrated that a stem cell/oxygen-releasing HP hybrid system could further improve erectile function, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) level, and NOS level in a bilateral cavernous nerve injury rat model through prolonged stem cell survival. Our data suggest that a stem cell/oxygen-releasing HP system is a promising clinical treatment option for postprostatectomy erectile dysfunction. Furthermore, this system may be relevant in different disease therapies and regenerative medicine.""","""['Ae Ryang Jung', 'Yong Hyun Park', 'Ga Eun Kim', 'Mee Young Kim', 'Seung Hwan Jeon', 'Ho Yong Kim', 'So Young Kim', 'Se Heang Oh', 'Ji Youl Lee']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Tissue Eng Part A""","""['Combined therapeutic effect of udenafil and adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-membrane system in a rat model of cavernous nerve injury.', 'Combination Therapy Using Human Adipose-derived Stem Cells on the Cavernous Nerve and Low-energy Shockwaves on the Corpus Cavernosum in a Rat Model of Post-prostatectomy Erectile Dysfunction.', 'Combined effects of brain-derived neurotrophic factor immobilized poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid membrane with human adipose-derived stem cells and basic fibroblast growth factor hydrogel on recovery of erectile dysfunction.', 'Bilateral Cavernous Nerve Crush Injury in the Rat Model: A Comparative Review of Pharmacologic Interventions.', 'Is there a role for stem cell therapy in erectile dysfunction secondary to cavernous nerve injury?

Since 1998, detailed data on radiotherapy delivered to Swedish men with PCa (e.g. treatment modalities, absorbed doses, fractionation) have been collated within PCa data Base Sweden (PCBaSe). This study reports patterns of radical radiotherapy for PCa in Sweden over the past two decades.Materials and methods: All men with non-metastatic PCa (1998-2016) who received external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or high or low dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT/LDR-BT) were identified in PCBaSe. Analyses included: trends in radiation techniques, fractionation patterns and total doses over time; PCa-specific survival comparing treatment in 2007-2017 with 1998-2006; and regional variation in type of primary radiotherapy.Results: About 20,876 men underwent primary radiotherapy. The main treatment modalities include conventionally fractionated (2.0 Gy/fraction) EBRT (51%), EBRT with HDR-BT boost (27%) and hypofractionated (>2.4 Gy/fraction) EBRT (11%). EBRT with photon or proton boost and HDR-BT and LDR-BT monotherapies were each used minimally. Use of dose-escalated EBRT (>74 Gy) and moderate hypofractionation increased over time, while use of HDR-BT declined. Considerable regional variation in treatment modalities was apparent. Risk of PCa death following primary radiotherapy had declined for intermediate-risk (HR: 0.60; 95%CI 0.47-0.87) and high-risk PCa (HR: 0.72; 95%CI 0.61-0.86).Discussion: Increased use of dose escalation and hypofractionated EBRT has occurred in Sweden over the past two decades, reflecting current evidence and practice guidelines. Disease-specific outcomes have also improved. Data collected in PCBaSe provide an excellent resource for further research into RT use in PCa management.""","""['Kerri Beckmann', 'Hans Garmo', 'Per Nilsson', 'Ingela Franck Lissbrant', 'Anders Widmark', 'Pär Stattin']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Ten-year survival after High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy combined with External Beam Radiation Therapy in high-risk prostate cancer: A comparison with the Norwegian SPCG-7 cohort.', 'Brachytherapy improves biochemical failure-free survival in low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer compared with conventionally fractionated external beam radiation therapy: a propensity score matched analysis.', 'Brachytherapy boost (BT-boost) or stereotactic body radiation therapy boost (SBRT-boost) for high-risk prostate cancer (HR-PCa).', 'Permanent interstitial low-dose-rate brachytherapy for patients with localised prostate cancer: a systematic review of randomised and nonrandomised controlled clinical trials.', 'Low-dose rate brachytherapy for men with localized prostate cancer.', 'Metastatic progression following multimodal therapy for unfavorable-risk prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy Use and Patient-Reported Outcomes in Men With Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer in Australia and New Zealand.', 'Characterizing Surgical and Radiotherapy Outcomes in Non-metastatic High-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'The Value of Real-World Data in Understanding Prostate Cancer Risk and Improving Clinical Care: Examples from Swedish Registries.', 'A-blockers for the management of lower urinary tract symptoms in patients with prostate cancer treated with external beam radiotherapy: a randomized controlled study.']"""

Linoleic acid, a free fatty acid, and LPI are known as ligands for the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR), GPR40, and GPR55, respectively. We, herein, investigated whether gintonin could serve as a ligand for GPR40 and GPR55, using the insulin-secreting beta cell-derived cell line INS-1 and the human prostate cancer cell line PC-3, respectively. Gintonin dose-dependently enhanced insulin secretion from INS-1 cells. Gintonin-stimulated insulin secretion was partially inhibited by a GPR40 receptor antagonist but not an LPA1/3 receptor antagonist and was down-regulated by small interfering RNA (siRNA) against GPR40. Gintonin dose-dependently induced [Ca2+]i transients and Ca2+-dependent cell migration in PC-3 cells. Gintonin actions in PC-3 cells were attenuated by pretreatment with a GPR55 antagonist and an LPA1/3 receptor antagonist or by down-regulating GPR55 with siRNA. Taken together, these results demonstrated that gintonin-mediated insulin secretion by INS-1 cells and PC-3 cell migration were regulated by the respective activation of GPR40 and GPR55 receptors. These findings indicated that gintonin could function as a ligand for both receptors. Finally, we demonstrated that gintonin contained two more GPCR ligands, in addition to that for LPA receptors.

RORα was shown to regulate a broad array of physiological processes such as Purkinje cell development in the cerebellum, circadian rhythm, lipid and bone metabolism, inhibition of inflammation, and anti-apoptosis. The human RORα gene encodes at least four distinct isoforms (RORα1, -2, -3, -4), which differ only in their N-terminal domain (NTD). Two isoforms, RORα2 and 3, are not expressed in mice, whereas RORα1 and 4 are expressed both in mice and humans. In the present study, we identified the specific NTD of RORα2 that enhances prostate tumor progression and proliferation via lysine methylation-mediated recruitment of coactivator complex pontin/Tip60. Upregulation of the RORα2 isoform in prostate cancers putatively promotes tumor formation and progression. Furthermore, binding between coactivator complex and RORα2 is increased by lysine methylation of RORα2 because methylation permits subsequent interaction with binding partners. This methylation-dependent activation is performed by SET domain containing 7 (SETD7) methyltransferase, inducing the oncogenic potential of RORα2. Thus, post-translational lysine methylation of RORα2 modulates oncogenic function of RORα2 in prostate cancer.

The mutational landscape was obtained via whole exome sequencing of the amplification mixture of 49 single cells, and the transcriptomes of 69 single cells were also obtained.  Results:   The five putative driver genes mutated in BCC are CASC5, NUTM1, PTPRC, KMT2C, and TBX3, and the top three nucleotide substitutions are C>T, T>C, and C>A, similar to common prostate cancer. The distribution of the variant allele frequency values indicated that these single cells are from the same tumor clone. The 69 single cells were clustered into tumor, stromal, and immune cells based on their global transcriptomic profiles. The tumor cells specifically express basal cell markers like KRT5, KRT14, and KRT23 and epithelial markers EPCAM, CDH1, and CD24. The transcription factor covariance network analysis showed that the BCC tumor cells have distinct regulatory networks. By comparison with current prostate cancer datasets, we found that some of the bulk samples exhibit basal cell signatures.

Thus, mA4 would be more suitable to use in the clinical settings of prostate cancer (PCa). We aimed to characterize this optimized oligonucleotide to verify its potential as a diagnostic tool. The sequences and structures of A4 and mA4 were compared through in silico approaches to corroborate their similarity. Then, the degradation of mA4 was measured in appropriate media and human plasma for in vitro tests. In addition, the binding abilities of A4 to prostate cells were contrasted with those of mA4.

Therefore, mA4 maintains the crucial 3D structures of A4 that would allow binding to its target, as suggested by in silico and binding analyses. mA4 may be a good PCa reporter as it does not change cellular parameters of prostate cells when incubated with it.

The cytotoxic response to PT-112 is associated with the emission of danger signals underpinning the initiation of anticancer immunity, including calreticulin exposure on the surface of dying cells, as well as ATP and HMGB1 secretion. Consistently, mouse cancer cells succumbing to PT-112 in vitro can be used to provide syngeneic, immunocompetent mice with immunological protection against a subsequent challenge with living tumor cells of the same type. Moreover, PT-112 administration synergizes with PD-1 or PD-L1 blockade in the control of mouse cancers in immunologically competent settings, as it simultaneously recruits immune effector cells and depletes immunosuppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment. Finally, PT-112 employed intratumorally in the context of immune checkpoint inhibition initiates a robust immune response that has systemic outreach and limits the growth of untreated, distant lesions. Thus, PT-112 induces the immunogenic demise of cancer cells, and hence stands out as a promising combinatorial partner of immune checkpoint blockers, especially for the treatment of otherwise immunologically cold tumors.""","""['Takahiro Yamazaki', 'Aitziber Buqué', 'Tyler D Ames', 'Lorenzo Galluzzi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Oncoimmunology""","""['Development of a new fusion-enhanced oncolytic immunotherapy platform based on herpes simplex virus type 1.', 'Immunogenic Cell Death Inducing Fluorinated Mitochondria-Disrupting Helical Polypeptide Synergizes with PD-L1 Immune Checkpoint Blockade.', 'CDK12/13 inhibition induces immunogenic cell death and enhances anti-PD-1 anticancer activity in breast cancer.', 'Improvement strategy for immune checkpoint blockade: A focus on the combination with immunogenic cell death inducers.', 'Combination Cancer Immunotherapy of Nanoparticle-Based Immunogenic Cell Death Inducers and Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors.', 'Chemotherapeutic and targeted drugs-induced immunogenic cell death in cancer models and antitumor therapy: An update review.', 'Immunogenic cell death in cancer: concept and therapeutic implications.', 'Immunogenic Cell Death in Hematological Malignancy Therapy.', 'Insights and Strategies of Melanoma Immunotherapy: Predictive Biomarkers of Response and Resistance and Strategies to Improve Response Rates.', 'Neoadjuvant immunotherapy for resectable esophageal cancer: A review.']"""

Radium-223 is approved for patients with symptomatic bone metastases, no visceral involvement, progressing after at least 2 lines of systemic therapy, or ineligible for any other systemic treatment.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective, observational study on patients with mCRPC treated with radium-223 at our institution outside of clinical trials, to assess the safety and activity in a real-world population. Data regarding baseline patient/disease characteristics and treatment outcomes (number of cycles, treatment-related adverse events [AEs], cause of discontinuation, and best response) were collected.  Results:   Overall, 41 patients were treated from September 2015 to September 2018. Median age was 73 years; baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) was 0, 1, or 2 in 15%, 80%, and 5% of cases, respectively; and 3%, 41%, 44%, and 12% of patients had <6, 6-20, >20, and superscan bone lesions, respectively. A median number of 5 cycles (interquartile range 3-6) with median dose 19.52 MBq (interquartile range 12.87-24.83) was received. Treatment schedule was completed in 49% of cases; discontinuations due to AEs, disease-related death, or disease progression occurred in 24%, 33%, and 43% of patients, respectively. Any-grade AEs occurred in 73% and grade 3/4 treatment-related AEs occurred in 29% of patients, mainly anemia, decreased platelet count, and fatigue. No skeletal-related events or treatment-related deaths were recorded. After treatment, 66%, 2%, and 32% of patients had a stable, improved, or deteriorated ECOG PS versus baseline, respectively, and 24%, 61%, and 15% reported a stable, improved, or worsened pain symptom control. Post-treatment versus baseline alkaline phosphatase was reduced or stable in 46% and increased in 54% of patients, whereas prostate-specific antigen was decreased or stable in 83% and increased in 17% of patients.

Many anticancer drugs in current clinical use have been isolated from plant species or are based on such substances. Thymol (5-methyl-2-isopropylphenol) is an oxygenated aromatic compound from monoterpene group. It is the main constituent of thyme essential oil and shows antioxidant, antiseptic and antiproliferative properties. The aim of this study is to determine the antiproliferative activity and apoptotic effect of thymol on prostate cancer (PC-3, DU145), breast cancer (MDA-MB-231), and lung cancer (KLN205) cell lines.  Methods:   The cancer cells were treated with different concentrations of thymol (100, 200, 400, 600, 800 µM) at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. The cell viability was investigated by MTT assay and analysis of apoptosis was determined with annexin V assay.  Results:   The study showed the dose and time-dependent cytotoxic effect of thymol in PC-3, DU145, MDA-MB-231, and KLN205 cancer cell lines. Thymol significantly induced apoptosis in all groups in a dose-dependent manner. Statistical analysis showed a significant difference between thymol‑treated cell lines compared to the control (p < 0.001).  Conclusion:   The data in the present study demonstrated that thymol has apoptotic and antiproliferative properties in lung, breast and prostate cancer cell lines.

In addition, the combination of the two systems to more completely assess CTCs was investigated.  Patients and methods:   In all, 28 patients with metastatic prostate cancer were included. Two 6 mL peripheral blood samples were taken from each patient at the same time-point. The samples were then subjected to the two different technology platforms in parallel. An additional group of samples was acquired by applying the waste chamber material from the FAST-group tests (flow-through that goes through the FAST filter membrane) to the Rarecyte system for the detection any CTCs that were not captured by FAST.  Results:   The three groups had significantly different putative CTC-positive tests, with positive rates of 29% for Rarecyte, 57% for FAST, and 79% for the combination. We also assessed CTC phenotype: 56.6% of the CTCs were cytokeratin (CK)+/epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)-, 3.1% were CK-/EpCAM+, and 40.3% were CK+/EPCAM+. The captured CTCs diameter ranged from 5.2 to 16.9 µm. The mean CTC size from the FAST waste chamber was significantly smaller. The diameters for each of the phenotypic groups were significantly different.  Conclusions:   These data highlight disparities in the positive rates and enumerated CTC numbers detected by the two techniques. Notably, the combination of the two technologies resulted in the highest CTC-capture rates. Smaller CTCs were more likely to be missed by the FAST as they passed through the filter system.

This pooled analysis evaluated the effect of ATB and PPI on outcome in patients randomized between ICI and chemotherapy.  Patients and methods:   This retrospective analysis used pooled data from the phase II POPLAR (NCT01903993) and phase III OAK (NCT02008227) trials, which included 1512 patients with previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) randomly assigned to receive atezolizumab (n = 757) or docetaxel (n = 755).

Toxicological tests included hemolytic activity, toxicity toward the brine shrimp Artemia, cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells (MCF7) and acute oral toxicity in rodents. In addition, toxicogenomics techniques were used to determine genome expression in MCF7 cells exposed to EETg. The results showed that the extract exhibits approximately 60% of hemolytic activity at the highest tested concentration (64 µg/ml) and toxicity against nauplii of Artemia sp. (LC50 of 67.85 µg/ml). Further, EETg appears to be cytotoxic to MCF7 (cell viability reduced to 40% at 250 µg/ml after 24 hr). Genomic data demonstrated differential expression of 14 genes.

Current standard immunotherapy showed promising results for PCa patients with metastatic, but less advanced, disease (i.e., fewer than 20 bone lesions) suggesting that PCa growth in bone contributes to response to immunotherapy. We found that: (1) PCa stimulates recruitment of neutrophils, the most abundant immune cell in bone, and (2) that neutrophils heavily infiltrate regions of prostate tumor in bone of BM-PCa patients. Based on these findings, we examined the impact of direct neutrophil-prostate cancer interactions on prostate cancer growth. Bone marrow neutrophils directly induced apoptosis of PCa in vitro and in vivo, such that neutrophil depletion in bone metastasis models enhanced BM-PCa growth. Neutrophil-mediated PCa killing was found to be mediated by suppression of STAT5, a transcription factor shown to promote PCa progression. However, as the tumor progressed in bone over time, neutrophils from late-stage bone tumors failed to elicit cytotoxic effector responses to PCa. These findings are the first to demonstrate that bone-resident neutrophils inhibit PCa and that BM-PCa are able to progress via evasion of neutrophil-mediated killing.

The association with second tumors was also evaluated. All data were compared with data from female BCs.  Results:   In the 2000-2014 period, 2175 new cases of MBC were registered, with an SIR of 1.7 × 100,000. The incidence showed a slight upward trend and increased with increasing age.

Its role in high-risk and node-positive prostate cancer, however, is unknown. We hypothesise that a five-fraction schedule of extreme hypofractionation will be non-inferior to a moderately hypofractionated regimen over 5 weeks in efficacy and will have acceptable toxicity and quality of life while reducing the cost implications during treatment.  Methods and analysis:   This is an ongoing, non-inferiority, multicentre, randomised trial (NCT03561961) of two schedules for National Cancer Control Network high-risk and/or node-positive non-metastatic carcinoma of the prostate. The standard arm will be a schedule of 68 Gy/25# over 5 weeks while the test arm will be extremely hypofractionated radiotherapy with stereotactic body radiation therapy to 36.25 Gy/5# (7 to 10 days). The block randomisation will be stratified by nodal status (N0/N+), hormonal therapy (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone therapy/orchiectomy) and centre. All patients will receive daily image-guided radiotherapy.The primary end point is 4-year biochemical failure free survival (BFFS). The power calculations assume 4-year BFFS of 80% in the moderate hypofractionation arm. With a 5% one-sided significance and 80% power, a total of 434 patients will be randomised to both arms equally (217 in each arm). The secondary end points include overall survival, prostate cancer specific survival, acute and late toxicities, quality of life and out-of-pocket expenditure.  Discussion:   The trial aims to establish a therapeutically efficacious and cost-efficient modality for high-risk and node-positive prostate cancer with an acceptable toxicity profile. Presently, this is the only trial evaluating and answering such a question in this cohort.  Ethics and dissemination:   The trial has been approved by IEC-III of Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai.

Here, we show that PCAT1 and ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1 (ABCB1) are highly expressed in NSCLC tissues and cell lines, and regulate the growth and apoptosis of these cells. Compared with those in DDP-sensitive patients, PCAT1 and ABCB1 are highly expressed in the tumors of DDP-resistant patients, and such overexpression correlates with a shorter overall survival of these patients. Knockdown of PCAT1 or upregulation of miR-129 led to apoptosis and sensitized the DDP-resistant cells to DDP. The 3' UTR activity of PCAT1 and ABCB1, which was increased by PCAT1 overexpression, was shown to harbor an miR-129 binding site. DDP resistance is induced by elevated ABCB1 expression, which involves binding of miR-129 in DDP resistant cells.

The accuracy of fusion-guided biopsies is limited due to false positive radiological findings as well as to histological evidence for cancer in radiologically inconspicuous regions of the prostate. We aimed to analyze histomorphological findings on mpMRI lesions highly suspicious for CaP classified as PI-RADS 4 or PI-RADS 5 (Prostate Imaging - Recording and Data System) but cancer-negative in the biopsy of this region of interest (ROI), and to compare them with findings in radiologically inconspicuous regions.  Materials and methods:   We re-evaluated prostate biopsies from 57 patients who underwent TB in combination with systematic standard biopsy (SB) from June 2017 to July 2018 at the University Hospital Schleswig Holstein Campus Luebeck. Out of 143 ROIs, 34 PI-RADS 4/5 cancer-negative lesions were identified and subjected to comprehensive histomorphological reevaluation. Contralateral cancer-negative SBs were used as control. Chi-square test was used for statistical analysis.  Results:   The frequency of histomorphological alterations including stromal, glandular, vascular, and inflammatory alterations were 97% and 79.2% in prostatic tissues from cancer-negative TBs and SBs, respectively. Stromal, glandular, and inflammatory alterations were present in the majority of biopsies from both TBs and SBs. Statistical analysis revealed no significant difference between TBs and SBs with regard to stromal, glandular, and inflammatory alterations. However, vascular abnormalities were exclusively detected in TBs (18.2%).  Conclusion:   The frequency of histomorphological alterations is slightly higher in prostate tissues from TBs compared to SB. Only vascular alterations seem to be distinct for TBs.

The objective of the present study was to analyze the outcome of tumors treated with ADT as primary therapy in the Spanish Prostate Cancer Registry (19.4% of the series).  Patients and methods:   Patients were classified in three groups: 1) with low/intermediate risk clinically localized tumors; 2) with high risk and locally advanced (T3-4) tumors; 3) with metastatic tumors. Time to castration resistance and overall cancer-specific survival were analyzed. In non-metastatic tumors, survivals in patients treated with ADT were compared with data from patients who underwent local treatments from the Spanish Prostate Cancer Registry.  Results:   703 cases were analyzed. There were significant differences in the time to castration resistance, which was lower in the group of metastatic tumors. During follow-up, there were 179 deaths (25.5%) of which 89 (12.6%) were due to PCa. After 3 years of ADT, only 14.6% of patients in group 1 had died (1% due to PCa), 20.5% in group 2 and 46.8% in group 3 (9.2% and 31.3% due to PCa, respectively). Cancer-specific survival was significantly worse in group 1 using ADT than radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy. In high-risk and locally advanced tumors, ADT also had a lower cancer-specific survival than local treatments.

However, the function of BAP18 on oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and its molecular mechanism remains to be elusive.  Methods:   OSCC-derived cell lines carrying silenced BAP18 were established by Lentiviral infection. Quantitative PCR (qPCR), western blot, and ChIP assay were performed to detect gene transcription regulation and the possible mechanism. Colony formation, cell growth curve and xenograft tumor experiments were performed to examine cell growth and proliferation.  Findings:   Our study demonstrated that BAP18 was highly expressed in OSCC samples compared with that in benign. BAP18 depletion obviously influenced the expression of a series of genes, including cell cycle-related genes. We thus provided the evidence to demonstrate that BAP18 depletion significantly decreases CCND1 and CCND2 (CCND1/2) transcription. In addition, BAP18 is recruited to the promoter regions of CCND1/2, thereby facilitating the recruitment of the core subunits of MLL1 complex to the same regions, to increase histone H3K4me3 levels. Furthermore, BAP18 depletion delayed G1-S phase transition and inhibited cell growth in OSCC-derived cell lines.  Interpretation:   This study suggests that BAP18 is involved in modulation of CCND1/2 transcription and promotes OSCC progression. BAP18 could be a potential target for OSCC treatment and diagnosis.

Nonnucleoside RT inhibitors, e.g. efavirenz (EFV) and SPV122.2, reduce proliferation and promote differentiation of cancer cells, concomitant with a global reprogramming of the transcription profile. Both inhibitors have therapeutic anticancer efficacy in animal models. Here we have sought to clarify the mechanisms of RT inhibitors in cancer cells. We report that exposure of PC3 metastatic prostate carcinoma cells to both RT inhibitors results in decreased proliferation, and concomitantly induces genome damage. This is associated with rearrangements of the nuclear architecture, particularly at peripheral chromatin, disruption of the nuclear lamina, and budding of micronuclei. These changes are reversible upon discontinuation of the RT-inhibitory treatment, with reconsititution of the lamina and resumption of the cancer cell original features. The use of pharmacological autophagy inhibitors proves that autophagy is largely responsible for the antiproliferative effect of RT inhibitors.

Methods and materials:   Prostate plans of 235 patients were retrospectively reviewed. Interinstitutional plan quality comparisons were made based on distributions of protocol-specified parameters using 1-way analysis of variance with Games-Howell post hoc analysis. Dosimetrically representative cases were selected from each center using k-medoid clustering, enabling side-by-side comparison of dose-volume histograms and dose distributions. Fourteen anatomic features were investigated to explore interinstitutional patient population differences. Anatomically representative cases were selected from each center to explore differences in planning practices. Tumor control probability (TCP), as well as rectal wall and bladder wall normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCPs), were calculated to quantify the clinical effect of the differences in plan quality.  Results:   Comparing the mean value of each center to the other 3, statistically significant differences were observed for bladder wall D30% and D50%, left and right femoral heads D5%, planning target volume D99% and D1cc, and clinical target volume D99%. Dosimetrically representative cases demonstrated consistent results. Although anatomic differences were observed between the center-specific populations, an analysis using anatomically similar cases demonstrated consistent trends in the dosimetric differences, suggesting the dosimetric variation is not exclusively due to anatomic differences. Minimal differences (<1%) among the 4 centers were noted for TCP and NTCPs, suggesting the reported differences in plan quality may not have any clinical significance.  Conclusions:   Despite common guidelines, statistically significant differences in plan quality metrics occurred among the 4 investigated centers. The differences are due at least in part to variation in local planning practices. TCP and NTCP calculations suggest that the clinical significance of the differences is minimal. These results can serve as a reference for the degree of variation among centers that can be accepted when a common protocol is adopted.""","""['Lingyue Sun', 'Wendy Smith', 'Charles Kirkby']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Radiotherapy of prostate cancer with or without intensity modulated beams: a planning comparison.', 'The comparison of radiotherapy techniques for treatment of the prostate cancer: the three-field vs. the four-field.', 'Class solutions for conformal external beam prostate radiotherapy.', 'Do differences in target volume definition in prostate cancer lead to clinically relevant differences in normal tissue toxicity?', 'Dosimetry and radiobiologic model comparison of IMRT and 3D conformal radiotherapy in treatment of carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Do Dosiomic Features Extracted From Planned 3-Dimensional Dose Distribution Improve Biochemical Failure-Free Survival Prediction: an Analysis Based on a Large Multi-Institutional Data Set.']"""

We undertook an open-label, phase I, dose-escalation study in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) to determine the safety and efficacy of intratumoral and s.c. injection of HVJ-E (GEN0101). Patients with CRPC, who were resistant to or unable to receive standard of care, were included. GEN0101 was injected directly into the prostate and s.c. in two 28-day treatment cycles. The primary end-points were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of GEN0101 and determine its recommended dose. The secondary end-points were to analyze the antitumor effect and tumor immunity. Three patients received 30 000 mNAU GEN0101 and 6 received 60 000 mNAU. There was no dose-limiting toxicity, and the recommended dose of GEN0101 was defined as 60 000 mNAU. Radiographically, 1 patient had stable disease and 2 had progressive disease in the low-dose group, whereas 5 patients had stable disease and 1 had progressive disease in the high-dose group. Three patients in the high-dose group showed reduction in lymph node metastasis. Prostate-specific antigen increase rates in the high-dose group were suppressed more than those in the low-dose group.

Two BRB foods, a confection and nectar, providing a consistent and reproducible product for human clinical studies are designed and characterized.  Methods and results:   Men with clinically localized prostate cancer are sequentially enrolled to a control group or one of four intervention groups (confection or nectar, 10 or 20 g dose; n = 8 per group) for 4 weeks prior to prostatectomy. Primary outcomes include: safety, adherence, and ellagitannin metabolism. Adherence to the intervention is >96%. No significant (≥grade II) toxicities are detected. Urinary urolithins (A, B, C, and D) and dimethyl ellagic acid (DMEA) quantified by Ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy (UPLC/MS/MS) indicate a dose-dependent excretion yet heterogeneous patterns among men. Men in the BRB confection groups have greater urinary excretion of the microbial urinary metabolites urolithin A and DMEA, suggesting that this food matrix provides greater colonic microflora exposure.

We evaluated economic outcomes in men with chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castration-resistant PC (mCRPC) treated with enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate plus prednisone (abiraterone).  Methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis on 3174 men (18 years or older) utilizing the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) database from 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2018. Men with mCRPC were included if they had at least one pharmacy claim for enzalutamide or abiraterone (first claim date = index date) following surgical or medical castration, had no chemotherapy treatment within 12 months prior to the index date, and had continuous VHA enrollment for at least 12 months pre- and post-index date. Men were followed until death, disenrollment, or end of study and were 1:1 propensity score matched (PSM). All-cause and PC-related resource use and costs per patient per month (PPPM) in the 12 months post index were compared between matched cohorts.  Results:   We identified 1229 men with mCRPC prescribed enzalutamide and 1945 prescribed abiraterone with mean ages of 74 and 73 years, respectively. After PSM, each cohort had 1160 patients. The enzalutamide cohort had fewer all-cause (2.51 vs 2.86; p < 0.0001) and PC-related outpatient visits (0.86 vs 1.03; p < 0.0001), with corresponding lower all-cause ($2588 vs $3115; p < 0.0001) and PC-related ($1356 vs $1775; p < 0.0001) PPPM outpatient costs compared with the abiraterone cohort. All-cause total costs (medical and pharmacy) PPPM ($8085 vs $9092; p = 0.0002) and PC-related total costs PPPM ($6321 vs $7280; p < 0.0001) were significantly lower in the enzalutamide cohort compared with the abiraterone cohort.

We assessed ePRO user experiences and perceived value among Black and White cancer patients.  Methods:   We recruited 30 Black and 49 White bladder and prostate cancer patients from a single institution. Participants reported symptoms using either a web-based or automated telephone interface over 3 months and completed satisfaction surveys and qualitative interviews focused on user experiences and value. Using a narrative mixed methods approach, we evaluated overall and race-specific differences in ePRO user experiences and perceived value.  Results:   Most participants selected the web-based system, but Blacks were more likely to use the automated telephone-based system than Whites. In satisfaction surveys, Whites more commonly reported ease in understanding and reporting symptoms compared with Blacks. Blacks more often reported that the ePRO system was helpful in facilitating symptom-related discussions with clinicians. During interviews, Blacks described how the ePRO helped them recognize symptoms, while Whites found value in better understanding and tracking symptoms longitudinally. Blacks also expressed preferences for paper-based ePRO options due to perceived ease in better understanding of symptom items.  Conclusion:   Electronic patient-reported outcomes are perceived as valuable for variable reasons by Black and White cancer populations, with greater perceived value for communicating with clinicians reported among Blacks.

We found that implementing routine computed tomography (CT)-based screening was feasible in the setting of a prospective study, but the yield of osteoporosis identification was low in this population.  Purpose:   Men with prostate cancer (PCa) are at increased risk of hip fracture for multiple reasons. Estimation of hip fracture risk with the FRAX tool is currently recommended, but FRAX alone may not identify a portion of men with osteoporosis. We hypothesized that adding bone mineral density (BMD) screening using CT to FRAX is feasible and would identify more men with osteoporosis.  Methods:   Men with PCa scheduled to undergo CT simulation for radiation treatment were enrolled in a single-arm prospective study. The mean attenuation of the mid-L5 vertebral body trabecular bone (L5CT) was calculated on a single slice using the radiation simulation CT scan. The 10-year risk of hip fracture was calculated using the FRAX tool. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was performed for men whose L5CT measurement was less than 130 Hounsfield units (HU).  Results:   A total of 98 eligible men were enrolled and underwent FRAX and CT screening. The median 10-year risk of hip fracture was 1.1% and exceeded 3% in 16 cases; the median L5CT was 162.28 HU (range 55.6-526.1 HU). DXA scan was completed in 15 men who had L5CT < 130 HU but 10-year calculated hip fracture risk < 3%, 1 of whom was found to have osteoporosis (T-score ≤ -2.5).

An analysis of pooled phase III data suggested differences in overall survival (OS) between African American and Caucasian men receiving sipuleucel-T. We explored this in PROCEED (NCT01306890), an FDA-requested registry in over 1900 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated with sipuleucel-T.  Patients and methods:   OS for patients who received ≥1 sipuleucel-T infusion was compared between African American and Caucasian men using an all patient set and a baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-matched set (two Caucasians to every one African American with baseline PSAs within 10% of each other). Univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted. Survival data were examined using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard methodologies.  Results:   Median follow-up was 46.6 months. Overall survival differed between African American and Caucasian men with hazard ratios (HR) of 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.68-0.97, P = 0.03) in the all patient set and 0.70 (95% CI: 0.57-0.86, P < 0.001) in the PSA-matched set. Median OS was longer in African Americans than in Caucasian men for both analysis sets, e.g., 35.3 and 25.8 months, respectively, in the PSA-matched set. Similar results were observed in the all patient set. Differences were larger when treatment began at lower baseline PSA; curves were more similar among patients with higher baseline PSA. In patients with baseline PSA below the median, the HR was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.37-0.72, P < 0.001), with median OS of 54.3 versus 33.4 months. Known prognostic factors and African American race (multivariable analyses; HR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.48-0.74, P < 0.001) were independently associated with OS.

Differentially expressed RNAs were identified in urine samples by deep sequencing and metabolites in urine were measured by mass spectrometry. mRNA and metabolite profiles were distinct in patients with benign and malignant disease. Integrated analysis of urinary gene expression and metabolite signatures unveiled an aberrant glutamate metabolism and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle node in prostate cancer-derived cells. Functional validation supported a role for glutamate metabolism and glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 1 (GOT1)-dependent redox balance in PCa, which could be exploited for novel biomarkers and therapies. In this study, we discovered cancer-specific changes in urinary RNAs and metabolites, paving the way for the development of sensitive and specific urinary PCa diagnostic biomarkers either alone or in combination.

A click chemistry-based flux assay reveals that necrocytosis provides not only amino acids, but sugars, fatty acids and nucleotides for biosynthesis, conferring resistance to therapies targeting anabolic pathways. Indeed, necrotic cell debris allow macropinocytic breast and prostate cancer cells to proliferate, despite fatty acid synthase inhibition. Standard therapies such as gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), doxorubicin and gamma-irradiation directly or indirectly target nucleotide biosynthesis, creating stress that is relieved by scavenged nucleotides. Strikingly, necrotic debris also render macropinocytic, but not non-macropinocytic, pancreas and breast cancer cells resistant to these treatments. Selective, genetic inhibition of macropinocytosis confirms that necrocytosis both supports tumor growth and limits the effectiveness of 5-FU in vivo.

Methods: Men who were treated with 177Lu-PSMA under a compassionate-access program at our institution and had available PSA values at baseline and at 6 wk after treatment initiation were included in this retrospective analysis. Patients were assigned to 3 groups on the basis of PSA changes: response (≥30% decline), progression (≥25% increase), and stable (<30% decline and <25% increase). The coprimary endpoints were overall survival and imaging-based progression-free survival. The secondary endpoints were PSA changes at 12 wk and PSA flare-up. Results: We identified 124 eligible patients with PSA values at 6 wk. A greater than or equal to 30% decline in PSA at 6 wk was associated with longer overall survival (median, 16.7 mo; 95% CI, 14.4-19.0) than stable PSA (median, 11.8 mo; 95% CI, 8.6-15.1) (P = 0.007) or PSA progression (median, 6.5 mo; 95% CI, 5.2-7.8) (P < 0.001). Patients with a greater than or equal to 30% decline in PSA at 6 wk also had a lower risk of imaging-based progression than patients with stable PSA (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.38-0.94) (P = 0.02), whereas patients with PSA progression had a higher risk of imaging-based progression than patients with stable PSA (hazard ratio, 3.18; 95% CI, 1.95-5.21) (P < 0.001). The percentage changes in PSA at 6 and 12 wk were highly associated (r = 0.90; P < 0.001). Of 31 patients who experienced early PSA progression at 6 wk, 29 (94%) showed biochemical progression at 12 wk. Overall, only 1 (3%) of 36 patients with PSA progression at 6 wk achieved any PSA decline at 12 wk (1% of the entire cohort). The limitations of the study included its retrospective nature and the single-center experience. Conclusion: PSA changes at 6 wk after 177Lu-PSMA initiation are an early indicator of long-term clinical outcome. Patients with PSA progression after 6 wk of treatment could benefit from a very early decision to switch treatment. PSA flare-up during 177Lu-PSMA treatment is very uncommon. Prospective studies are now warranted to validate our findings and potentially inform clinicians earlier on the effectiveness of 177Lu-PSMA.""","""['Andrei Gafita', 'Matthias M Heck', 'Isabel Rauscher', 'Robert Tauber', 'Lisena Cala', 'Charlott Franz', ""Calogero D'Alessandria"", 'Margitta Retz', 'Wolfgang A Weber', 'Matthias Eiber']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Long-Term Follow-up and Outcomes of Retreatment in an Expanded 50-Patient Single-Center Phase II Prospective Trial of 177Lu-PSMA-617 Theranostics in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', '177LuLu-PSMA-617 versus cabazitaxel in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (TheraP): a randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial.', 'Lutetium-177-labelled anti-prostate-specific membrane antigen antibody and ligands for the treatment of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Systemic Radioligand Therapy with (177)Lu Labeled Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen Ligand for Imaging and Therapy in Patients with Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Third-line treatment and 177Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'SUVmean on baseline 18FPSMA-1007 PET and clinical parameters are associated with survival in prostate cancer patients scheduled for 177LuLu-PSMA I&T.', 'Individual radiosensitivity reflected by γ-H2AX and 53BP1 foci predicts outcome in PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy.', 'mCRPC patients with PSA fluctuations under radioligand therapy have comparable survival benefits relative to patients with sustained PSA decrease.', 'Baseline clinical characteristics predict overall survival in patients undergoing radioligand therapy with 177LuLu-PSMA I&T during long-term follow-up.', 'Advances in PSMA theranostics.']"""

For thirteen major cancer types, we compared heterogeneities at the levels of mutations and gene expression with the repertoires of targeted therapeutics and their molecular targets accepted by the current guidelines in oncology. Totally, 85 drugs were investigated, collectively covering 82 individual molecular targets. For the first time, we showed that the repertoires of molecular targets of accepted drugs did not correlate with molecular heterogeneities of different cancer types. On the other hand, we found that the clinical recommendations for the available cancer drugs were strongly congruent with the gene expression but not gene mutation patterns. We detected the best match among the drugs usage recommendations and molecular patterns for the kidney, stomach, bladder, ovarian and endometrial cancers.

In this study, the function of POTEE in CRC was examined for the first time and its correlation with CRC cell biological behaviors was analyzed. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), western blotting, and immunohistochemistry revealed that POTEE was remarkably overexpressed in CRC and associated with an aggressive phenotype. We also found that POTEE was localized in the cytoplasm. In addition, downregulation of POTEE expression can notably inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC cell in vitro, and repressed tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. In contrast, overexpression of POTEE could promote the aggressive behaviors of CRC cells. Mechanistically, POTEE promoted CRC migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by increasing the activation of Rac1 and Cdc42.

Therefore, in this proof-of-principle study, we have evaluated the use of hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) in combination with targeted quantitative mass spectrometry for the sialic acid linkage-specific analysis of PSA glyco-proteoforms based on either trypsin or ArgC peptides. The efficiency of PSA proteolysis was optimized as well as the glycopeptide separation conditions (buffer type, strength, and pH). The HILIC-based analysis of PSA glyco-proteoforms presented here has the potential for the clinical validation of patient cohorts. The method shows the feasibility of the use of a HILIC stationary phase for the separation of isomeric glycopeptides to detect specific glyco-proteoforms.

No prospective study has investigated the association of dietary inflammatory index (DII) with PLC incidence and mortality. Therefore, we used prospective data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial to fill this gap. The DII was calculated from a validated 137-item food frequency questionnaire in a cohort of 103,902 individuals. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for PLC incidence, and competing risk regression was used to estimate subdistribution HRs (SHRs) for PLC mortality. Restricted cubic spline regression was employed to identify the potential dose-response pattern. A total of 120 PLC cases and 102 PLC deaths were observed during follow-up. Higher DII scores from food and supplement were found to be associated with higher risks of developing PLC (HRTertile 3 vs. 1 2.05; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-3.41) and death from this disease (SHRTertile 3 vs. 1 1.97; 95% CI 1.13-3.41). Similar results were obtained for DII score from food only. A nonlinear dose-response pattern was identified for the aforementioned associations (all pnonlinearity < 0.05). Overall, a more pro-inflammatory diet, as suggested by higher DII scores, is associated with higher risks of PLC incidence and mortality.

The elevated prevalence of HIV infection (12.6% of adults in 2018) results in high rates for HIV-related cancers, and the greater prevalence in central Mozambique, compared to the south, largely explains the rather higher rates of Kaposi sarcoma (males), non-Hodgkin lymphoma, squamous cell carcinoma of conjunctiva and cervical cancer in Beira than in Maputo. Burkitt lymphoma is the commonest childhood cancer in Beira, with high rates typical of East Africa, while the low rates in Maputo are more typical of Southern Africa. Overall, 44% of cancers in Maputo and 52% in Beira are estimated to be caused by infectious agents. In the last 60 years, cancers more frequent in developed countries, such as breast and prostate, are emerging in Mozambique. The incidence of the former in Maputo has increased fivefold since 1956-1960, that of prostate cancer 2.5-fold, and that of large bowel cancer doubled.

Objective:   To identify the physical, emotional, and practical concerns and associated unmet needs reported by cancer survivors.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cross-sectional survey study obtained data from the Experiences of Cancer Patients in Transitions Study of the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, in collaboration with cancer agencies in the 10 Canadian provinces, that was disseminated in 2016. This analysis included only adult survivors aged 30 years or older who underwent chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgical treatment, or a combination of these therapies for breast, prostate, colorectal, melanoma, or hematological cancer within the past 1 to 3 years. Data synthesis and quality assessment were conducted in 2017. Data analysis was completed in July 2019.  Main outcomes and measures:   The outcomes were the (1) quantification of the magnitude and multiplicity of the physical, emotional, and practical concerns of adult survivors of breast, colorectal, prostate, melanoma, or hematological cancer; (2) exploration of the magnitude of associated unmet needs; and (3) identification of patient-, treatment-, and cancer-specific factors associated with the reporting of unmet needs.  Results:   Overall, 10 717 adult respondents were included (5660 [53%] female and 6367 [60%] aged ≥65 years). The median number of concerns per respondent was 6 (interquartile range [IQR], 3-10). Among respondents with concerns, help was sought for a median of 2 (IQR, 0-4) concerns. Unmet needs were reported for a median of 4 (IQR, 2-7) concerns. Emotional concerns were reported by 8330 respondents (78%), physical concerns by 9236 respondents (86%), and practical concerns by 4668 respondents (44%). At least 1 unmet need was reported by 7033 survivors (84%) with emotional concerns, 7475 (81%) with physical concerns, and 3459 (74%) with practical concerns. Age, sex, annual income, marital status, geographic location, language, and treatment type were significant factors associated with unmet needs. Survivors of melanoma cancer had a significantly higher likelihood of reporting unmet emotional needs (odds ratio [OR], 1.75; 95% CI, 1.17-2.61; P = .01), whereas survivors of prostate (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43-0.84; P < .001) and hematological (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.50-0.99; P = .04) cancers were significantly less likely to report unmet needs for physical concerns when compared with breast cancer survivors.

Therefore, this study aimed to assess voiding and sexual function after robotic TME with autonomic nerve preservation. In particular, we focused on the long-term results in male patients operated by a single experienced surgeon.  Materials and methods:   We surveyed male patients aged 50 years and below at the time of robotic rectal cancer surgery between November 2011 and July 2018. Patients who died and those who had a recurrence and underwent abdominoperineal resection were excluded. The questionnaire covered the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and the 5-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) for voiding and sexual function, respectively.  Results:   Thirty-nine patients (median age, 44 y) were surveyed. IPSS and IIEF-5 scores were 5.7±5.3 and 14.7±8.4, respectively. Only 6 patients (15.4%) complained of poor quality of life due to their urinary symptoms. In sexual function, 10 patients (25.6%) complained severe reduction compared with their preoperative status. The average of postoperative days defined from surgery to the questionnaire was 37.8 months. A significant change in the IIEF-5 score was observed between 1 and 2 years postoperatively (5.8±6.9 vs. 16.5±8.8; P=0.027).  Conclusions:   As we only included male patients who were operated by a single experienced surgeon, the results of robotic TME with pelvic autonomic nerve preservation showed acceptable data in preserving both voiding and sexual functions. Although related clinical factors for poor functional outcomes was not statistically significant due to the small sample size, we could observe an improvement in sexual function between 1 and 2 years after surgery with long-term functional results.""","""['Ho Seung Kim', 'Jae Hyun Kang', 'Seung Yoon Yang', 'Nam Kyu Kim']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Surg Laparosc Endosc Percutan Tech""","""['Laparoscopic pelvic autonomic nerve-preserving surgery for patients with lower rectal cancer after chemoradiation therapy.', 'A comparative study of voiding and sexual function after total mesorectal excision with autonomic nerve preservation for rectal cancer: laparoscopic versus robotic surgery.', 'Assessment of sexual and voiding function after total mesorectal excision with pelvic autonomic nerve preservation in males with rectal cancer.', 'Total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer with emphasis on pelvic autonomic nerve preservation: Expert technical tips for robotic surgery.', 'Robotic surgical approach for rectal cancer.', 'Significance of Nerve Plane for Inferior Mesenteric Plexus Preservation in Laparoscopic Rectal Cancer Surgery.', 'Optimal Complete Rectum Mobilization Focused on the Anatomy of the Pelvic Fascia and Autonomic Nerves: 30 Years of Experience at Severance Hospital.', 'Clinical and oncological outcomes of the low ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery with robotic surgery in patients with rectal cancer following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.']"""

We describe the contemporary presentation and overall survival of these rare variants.  Materials and methods:   We examined 1,345,618 patients who were diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinoma between 2004 and 2015 within the National Cancer Database. We focused on the variants mucinous, ductal, signet ring cell, adenosquamous, sarcomatoid and neuroendocrine. Characteristics at presentation for each variant were compared with nonvariant prostate adenocarcinoma. Cox regression was used to study the impact of histological variant on overall mortality.  Results:   Few (0.38%) patients presented with rare variant prostate adenocarcinoma. All variants had higher clinical tumor stage at presentation than nonvariant (all p <0.001). Metastatic disease was most common with neuroendocrine (62.9%), followed by sarcomatoid (33.3%), adenosquamous (31.1%), signet ring cell (10.3%) and ductal (9.8%), compared to 4.2% in nonvariant (all p <0.001). Metastatic disease in mucinous (3.3%) was similar to nonvariant (p=0.2). Estimated 10-year overall survival was highest in mucinous (78.0%), followed by nonvariant (71.1%), signet ring cell (56.8%), ductal (56.3%), adenosquamous (20.5%), sarcomatoid (14.6%) and neuroendocrine (9.1%). At multivariable analysis, mortality was higher in ductal (HR 1.38, p <0.001), signet ring cell (HR 1.53, p <0.01), neuroendocrine (HR 5.72, p <0.001), sarcomatoid (HR 5.81, p <0.001) and adenosquamous (HR 9.34, p <0.001) as compared to nonvariant.

This paper describes a fast robust optimization tool that takes advantage of the GPU parallel computing technologies. The new robust optimization model is based on nine boundary dose distributions - two for ±range uncertainties, six for ±set-up uncertainties along anteroposterior (A-P), lateral (R-L) and superior-inferior (S-I) directions, and one for nominal situation. The nine boundary influence matrices were calculated using an in-house finite size pencil beam dose engine, while the conjugate gradient method was applied to minimize the objective function. The proton dose calculation algorithm and the conjugate gradient method were tuned for heterogeneous platforms involving the CPU host and GPU device. Three clinical cases - one head and neck cancer case, one lung cancer case, and one prostate cancer case - were investigated to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of the proposed robust optimizer. Compared with results from Varian Eclipse (version 13.3), the proposed method is found to be conducive to robust treatment planning that is less sensitive to range and setup uncertainties. The three tested cases show that targets can achieve high dose uniformity while organs at risks (OARs) are in better protection against setup and range errors. Based on the CPU + GPU heterogeneous platform, the execution times of the head and neck cancer case and the prostate cancer case are much less than half of Eclipse, while the run time of the lung cancer case is similar to that of Eclipse. The fast robust optimizer developed in this study can improve the reliability of traditional proton treatment planning in a much faster speed, thus making it possible for clinical utility.""","""['Yao Xu', 'Jinhu Chen', 'Ruifen Cao', 'Hongdong Liu', 'Xie George Xu', 'Xi Pei']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Comparison of linear and nonlinear programming approaches for ""worst case dose"" and ""minmax"" robust optimization of intensity-modulated proton therapy dose distributions.', 'Robust optimization for intensity-modulated proton therapy with soft spot sensitivity regularization.', 'Statistical evaluation of worst-case robust optimization intensity-modulated proton therapy plans using an exhaustive sampling approach.', 'Empowering Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy Through Physics and Technology: An Overview.', 'Intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) - The future of IMRT for head and neck cancer.']"""

These included acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and human breast cancer (BC) derived from two different tumor subtypes, ER+ invasive ductal carcinoma grade III (IDCG3) and metastatic carcinoma (MC). Four novel COL derivatives showed higher anti-proliferative activity than COL (IC50 = 8.6 nM) towards primary ALL cells in cell viability assays (IC50 range of 1.1-6.4 nM), and several were more potent towards primary IDCG3 (IC50 range of 0.1 to 10.3 nM) or MC (IC50 range of 2.3-9.1 nM) compared to COL (IC50 of 11.1 and 11.7 nM, respectively). In addition, several derivatives were selectively active toward primary breast cancer cells compared to normal breast epithelial cells. The most promising derivatives were subsequently tested against the NCI panel of 60 human cancer cell lines and seven derivatives were more potent than COL against leukemia, non-small-cell lung, colon, CNS and prostate cancers.

This process is usually time-consuming, and the plan quality depends on planer's experience and available planning time. In this study, we proposed to model the behaviors of human planners in treatment planning by a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based virtual treatment planner network (VTPN), such that it can operate the TPS in a human-like manner for treatment planning.  Methods and materials:   Using prostate cancer IMRT as an example, we established the VTPN using a deep neural network developed. We considered an in-house optimization engine with a weighted quadratic objective function. Virtual treatment planner network was designed to observe an intermediate plan DVHs and decide the action to improve the plan by changing weights and threshold dose in the objective function. We trained the VTPN in an end-to-end DRL process in 10 patient cases. A plan score was used to measure plan quality. We demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the trained VTPN in another 64 patient cases.  Results:   Virtual treatment planner network was trained to spontaneously learn how to adjust treatment planning parameters to generate high-quality treatment plans. In the 64 testing cases, with initialized parameters, quality score was 4.97 (±2.02), with 9.0 being the highest possible score. Using VTPN to perform treatment planning improved quality score to 8.44 (±0.48).

The trained VTPN is capable of behaving in a human-like way to produce high-quality plans.""","""['Chenyang Shen', 'Dan Nguyen', 'Liyuan Chen', 'Yesenia Gonzalez', 'Rafe McBeth', 'Nan Qin', 'Steve B Jiang', 'Xun Jia']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Improving efficiency of training a virtual treatment planner network via knowledge-guided deep reinforcement learning for intelligent automatic treatment planning of radiotherapy.', 'A hierarchical deep reinforcement learning framework for intelligent automatic treatment planning of prostate cancer intensity modulated radiation therapy.', 'The development of a deep reinforcement learning network for dose-volume-constrained treatment planning in prostate cancer intensity modulated radiotherapy.', 'Artificial intelligence applications in intensity modulated radiation treatment planning: an overview.', 'Knowledge-based planning for intensity-modulated radiation therapy: A review of data-driven approaches.', 'Deep neural network-based synthetic image digital fluoroscopy using digitally reconstructed tomography.', 'Automated treatment planning for liver cancer stereotactic body radiotherapy.', 'An integrated solution of deep reinforcement learning for automatic IMRT treatment planning in non-small-cell lung cancer.', 'Reinforcement learning in medical image analysis: Concepts, applications, challenges, and future directions.', 'Using Artificial Intelligence for Optimization of the Processes and Resource Utilization in Radiotherapy.']"""

FASN is responsible for de novo synthesis of the fatty acid palmitate; the building block for protein palmitoylation. Recent work has suggested that alongside its established role in promoting cell proliferation FASN may also promote invasion. We now find depletion of FASN expression increases prostate cancer cell adhesiveness, impairs HGF-mediated cell migration and reduces 3D invasion. These changes in motility suggest that FASN can mediate actin cytoskeletal remodelling; a process known to be downstream of Rho family GTPases. Here, we demonstrate that modulation of FASN expression specifically impacts on the palmitoylation of the atypical GTPase RhoU. Impaired RhoU activity in FASN depleted cells leads to reduced adhesion turnover downstream of paxillin serine phosphorylation, which is rescued by addition of exogenous palmitate. Moreover, canonical Cdc42 expression is dependent on the palmitoylation status of RhoU.

Existing clinical models for recurrence risk prediction do not account for population-based variation in the tumor phenotype, despite recent evidence suggesting the presence of a unique, more aggressive prostate cancer phenotype in African American (AA) patients. We investigated the capacity of digitally measured, population-specific phenotypes of the intratumoral stroma to create improved models for prediction of recurrence following radical prostatectomy.  Experimental design:   This study included 334 radical prostatectomy patients subdivided into training (VT, n = 127), validation 1 (V1, n = 62), and validation 2 (V2, n = 145). Hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides from resected prostates were digitized, and 242 quantitative descriptors of the intratumoral stroma were calculated using a computational algorithm. Machine learning and elastic net Cox regression models were constructed using VT to predict biochemical recurrence-free survival based on these features. Performance of these models was assessed using V1 and V2, both overall and in population-specific cohorts.  Results:   An AA-specific, automated stromal signature, AAstro, was prognostic of recurrence risk in both independent validation datasets [V1,AA: AUC = 0.87, HR = 4.71 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.65-13.4), P = 0.003; V2,AA: AUC = 0.77, HR = 5.7 (95% CI, 1.48-21.90), P = 0.01]. AAstro outperformed clinical standard Kattan and CAPRA-S nomograms, and the underlying stromal descriptors were strongly associated with IHC measurements of specific tumor biomarker expression levels.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that considering population-specific information and stromal morphology has the potential to substantially improve accuracy of prognosis and risk stratification in AA patients with prostate cancer.""","""['Hersh K Bhargava', 'Patrick Leo', 'Robin Elliott', 'Andrew Janowczyk', 'Jon Whitney', 'Sanjay Gupta', 'Pingfu Fu', 'Kosj Yamoah', 'Francesca Khani', 'Brian D Robinson', 'Timothy R Rebbeck', 'Michael Feldman', 'Priti Lal', 'Anant Madabhushi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Nuclear Shape and Architecture in Benign Fields Predict Biochemical Recurrence in Prostate Cancer Patients Following Radical Prostatectomy: Preliminary Findings.', 'Comparative analysis of three risk assessment tools in Australian patients with prostate cancer.', 'External validation of preoperative nomograms predicting biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'A validation of two preoperative nomograms predicting recurrence following radical prostatectomy in a cohort of European men.', 'Optimum Tools for Predicting Clinical Outcomes in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review of Prognostic Accuracy and Validity.', 'Algorithmic fairness in artificial intelligence for medicine and healthcare.', 'Artificial intelligence applications in prostate cancer.', 'Exploring the Use of Artificial Intelligence in the Management of Prostate Cancer.', 'Predicting neoadjuvant chemotherapy benefit using deep learning from stromal histology in breast cancer.', 'Integrative Histology-Genomic Analysis Predicts Hepatocellular Carcinoma Prognosis Using Deep Learning.']"""

In other tumor entities (ie, colon carcinoma, cervical cancer), DNA methylation markers have been approved as diagnostic tests with high diagnostic power. In our case-control study, we used an approved molecular cervical cancer diagnostics test that includes 6 DNA methylation markers (GynTect) for the detection of bladder cancer.  Patients and methods:   We included samples from 40 patients with bladder cancer and 34 control subjects. In a pilot study, we analyzed DNA methylation in 38 tumor tissues and 4 healthy ureters using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Subsequently, we determined the sensitivity and specificity of the GynTect for the detection of bladder cancer in urine sediments from 40 patients with bladder cancer and 30 control subjects with benign prostatic hyperplasia or urolithiasis.  Results:   The markers showed very different methylation rates in the NMIBC tissues, ranging from 2.6% to 78.9%. No methylation of any of the markers was detectable in the healthy ureters. Using the urine sediments from the patients with cancer and control subjects, we found surprisingly high sensitivity and specificity for the GynTect assay (60% and 96.7%, respectively). The application of different algorithms for evaluation of the markers included in GynTect resulted in a sensitivity of ≤ 90% and specificity of ≤ 100%.  Conclusion:   The GynTect assay, originally designed for cervical cancer diagnostics, showed unexpectedly high diagnostic accuracy for bladder cancer detection. The inclusion of additional methylation markers might allow for the development of a suitable diagnostic marker set based on the GynTect test for NMIBC diagnostics.""","""['Daniel Steinbach', 'Michael Kaufmann', 'Juliane Hippe', 'Mieczyslaw Gajda', 'Marc-Oliver Grimm']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Promoter hypermethylation of HS3ST2, SEPTIN9 and SLIT2 combined with FGFR3 mutations as a sensitive/specific urinary assay for diagnosis and surveillance in patients with low or high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.', 'ITIH5 and ECRG4 DNA Methylation Biomarker Test (EI-BLA) for Urine-Based Non-Invasive Detection of Bladder Cancer.', 'Detection of bladder cancer using novel DNA methylation biomarkers in urine sediments.', 'Follow-up in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer-International Bladder Cancer Network recommendations.', 'Molecular markers in disease detection and follow-up of patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.', 'Identification of potential DNA methylation biomarkers related to diagnosis in patients with bladder cancer through integrated bioinformatic analysis.', 'The Role of Novel Bladder Cancer Diagnostic and Surveillance Biomarkers-What Should a Urologist Really Know?', 'Advances in Diagnosis and Therapy for Bladder Cancer.', 'Changes of serum levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (SIL 2R) in patients with cervical cancer and their clinical significance.', 'Trends in urine biomarker discovery for urothelial bladder cancer: DNA, RNA, or protein?']"""

Methods and materials:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry (2004-2015), we identified patients with ccRCC and non-ccRCC (papillary [papRCC], chromophobe [chRCC], sarcomatoid [sarcRCC], and collecting duct [cdRCC]). Two consecutive time groups were considered - historical (2004-2009) and contemporary era (2010-2015). Temporal trends of tumor characteristics were evaluated. Cumulative incidence plots and multivariable competing risks regression models tested the effect of year groups on CSM.  Results:   Overall, 24,746 and 73,228 patients with non-ccRCC and ccRCC were evaluated. Of those, 42% and 58% were recorded in historical and contemporary era. Time trend analyses showed (1) tumor size decreased for non-ccRCC (estimated annual percent changes [EAPC]: -1.1%; P <0.01) and for ccRCC (EAPC: -1.0%; P <0.01), (2) rates of G3/G4 decreased for non-ccRCC (EAPC: -0.7%; P = 0.03), but increased for ccRCC (EAPC: +1.1; P <0.01), 3) rates of node positive disease decreased for non-ccRCC (EAPC:-3.1%; P = 0.02), but were stable for ccRCC (EAPC: +0.4; P =0.5), (4) rates of metastatic disease at diagnosis decreased for non-ccRCC (EAPC: -3.2%; P <0.01), but were stable for ccRCC (EAPC: -0.6%; P = 0.1), (5) among non-ccRCC, the percentage of papRCC increased (EAPC:+1%; P <0.01), while the percentage of sarcRCC (EAPC: -7%; P <0.01) and cdRCC (EAPC: -11.2%; P <0.01) decreased. Finally, in multivariable CRR models, lower CSM was recorded for contemporary non-ccRCC (HR: 0.7; P <0.001) and ccRCC (HR: 0.8; P <0.001) patients.  Conclusion:   Our findings illustrate a favorable stage and grade migration and improved cancer-specific mortality in contemporary non-ccRCC.

Methods:   Paired RB samples were collected, and the expression levels of TMPO-AS1, miR-199a-5p and HIF-1α were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR); TMPO-AS1 overexpressing plasmids and TMPO-AS1 shRNA were transfected into HXO-RB44 and SO-Rb50 cell lines respectively, and then proliferation, migration and invasion of RB cells were detected by CCK-8 assay and Transwell method. qRT-PCR and western blot were used to analyze the regulatory function of TMPO-AS1 on miR-199a-5p and HIF-1α; luciferase reporter gene assay was used to determine the regulatory relationship between miR-199a-5p and TMPO-AS1.  Results:   TMPO-AS1 was significantly up-regulated in cancerous tissues of RB samples (relatively expression: 2.97 vs 3.93, p < 0.001), negatively correlated with miR-199a-5p (r=-0.4813, p < 0.01).

Some studies have implicated organochlorine and organophosphate insecticides as risk factors (particularly the organodithioate class) and risk of clinically significant PCa subtypes. However, few studies have evaluated other pesticides. We used data from the Agricultural Health Study, a large prospective cohort of pesticide applicators in North Carolina and Iowa, to extend our previous work and evaluate 39 additional pesticides and aggressive PCa.  Methods:   We used Cox proportional hazards models, with age as the time scale, to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between ever use of individual pesticides and 883 cases of aggressive PCa (distant stage, poorly differentiated grade, Gleason score ≥ 7, or fatal prostate cancer) diagnosed between 1993 and 2015. All models adjusted for birth year, state, family history of PCa, race, and smoking status. We conducted exposure-response analyses for pesticides with reported lifetime years of use.

Previous studies pointed out that the accuracy of prompt gamma imaging is affected by the statistics (number of protons delivered per pencil beam) of the proton beams and the conformity between prompt gamma and dose distribution (PG-dose correlation). Recently a novel approach to re-optimize conventional treatment plans by boosting a few pencil beams with good PG-dose correlation above the statistics limit for reliable PG detectability was proposed. However, up to now, only PG-dose correlation on the planning computed tomography (CT) was considered, not accounting for the fact that the robustness of the PG-dose correlation is not guaranteed in the cases of interfractional anatomical changes. In this work, this approach is further explored with respect to the robustness of the PG-dose correlation of each pencil beam in the case of interfractional anatomical changes. A research computational platform, combining Monte Carlo pre-calculated pencil beams with the analytical Matlab-based treatment planning system (TPS) CERR, is used for treatment planning. Geant4 is used for realistic simulation of the dose delivery and PG generation for all individual pencil beams in the heterogeneous patient anatomy using multiple CT images for representative patient cases (in this work, CTs of one prostate and one head and neck cancer patient are used). First, a Monte Carlo treatment plan is created using CERR. Thereby the PG emission and dose distribution for each individual spot is obtained. Second, PG-dose correlation is quantified using the originally proposed approach as well as a new indicator, which accounts for the sensitivity of individual spots to heterogeneities in the 3D dose distribution. This is accomplished by using a 2D distal surface (dose surface) derived from the 3D dose distribution for each spot. A few pencil beams are selected for each treatment field, based on their PG-dose correlation and dose surface, and then boosted in the new re-optimized treatment plan. All treatment plans are then fully re-calculated with Monte Carlo on the CT scans of the corresponding patient at three different time points. The result shows that all treatment plans are comparable in terms of dose distribution and dose averaged LET distributions. The spots recommended by our indicators maintain good PG-dose correlation in the cases of interfractional anatomical changes, thus ensuring that the proton range shift due to anatomical changes can be monitored. Compared to another proposed spots aggregation approach, our approach shows advantages in terms of the detectability and reliability of PG, especially in presence of heterogeneities.""","""['Liheng Tian', 'Guillaume Landry', 'George Dedes', 'Marco Pinto', 'Florian Kamp', 'Claus Belka', 'Katia Parodi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Toward a new treatment planning approach accounting for in vivo proton range verification.', 'Accounting for prompt gamma emission and detection for range verification in proton therapy treatment planning.', 'Monte Carlo study on the sensitivity of prompt gamma imaging to proton range variations due to interfractional changes in prostate cancer patients.', 'High-density dental implants and radiotherapy planning: evaluation of effects on dose distribution using pencil beam convolution algorithm and Monte Carlo method.', 'Range uncertainties in proton therapy and the role of Monte Carlo simulations.', 'Management of Motion and Anatomical Variations in Charged Particle Therapy: Past, Present, and Into the Future.', 'Roadmap: proton therapy physics and biology.']"""

Methods:   From the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PCLO) cohort, we selected women diagnosed with BrCA from 1994-2014. To compare survival of cases to non-cases, we used exposure density sampling. We computed standard mortality ratios (SMRs) and performed Cox proportional hazards models with matched case-control sets, controlling for demographics (Model I) and additional covariates (Model II). We also examined survival by stage within BrCA cases.  Results:   Among 78,215 women enrolled in PLCO, there were 1211 in-situ and 4790 invasive BrCA cases. 15-year survival rates were 97.1 % (BrCA-specific) and 77.2 % (other-cause) among in-situ and 86.4 % (BrCA-specific) and 73.4 % (other-cause) among invasive cases.

Although the mechanism of Par-4-mediated induction of apoptosis has been well studied, the involvement of Par-4 in other mechanisms of cell death such as autophagy is unclear. We investigated the mechanism involved in Par-4-mediated autophagic cell death in human malignant glioma. We demonstrate for the first time that the tumor suppressor lipid, ceramide (Cer), causes Par-4 induction, leading to autophagic cell death in human malignant glioma. Furthermore, we identified the tumor suppressor protein p53 and BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) as downstream targets of Par-4 during Cer-mediated autophagic cell death. RNAi-mediated down-regulation of Par-4 blocks Cer-induced p53-BNIP3 activation and autophagic cell death, while upregulation of Par-4 augmented p53-BNIP3 activation and autophagic cell death. Remarkably, in many instances, Par-4 overexpression alone was sufficient to induce cell death which is associated with features of autophagy. Interestingly, similar results were seen when glioma cells were exposed to classical autophagy inducers such as serum starvation, arsenic trioxide, and curcumin.

PGCC have the potential to generate progeny through primitive or cleavage-like division, which allows them to evade antimitotic insults. We recently demonstrated that the sphingolipid enzyme acid ceramidase (ASAH1) is required for this process. Since specific ASAH1 inhibitors are not clinically available, we investigated whether tamoxifen, which interferes with ASAH1 function via off-target effects, has a potential clinical benefit independent of estrogen signaling. Our results show that tamoxifen inhibits generation of PGCC offspring in prostate cancer, glioblastoma, and melanoma cells. Analysis of two state-level cancer registries revealed that tamoxifen improves survival outcomes for second, nonbreast cancers that develop in women with early stage breast cancer. Our results suggest that tamoxifen may have a clinical benefit in a variety of cancers that is independent of estrogen signaling and could be due to its inhibition of acid ceramidase.

It is the most common cancer among men worldwide, with higher mortality in low and middle-income countries. In Ethiopia, it is the second most common cause of cancer morbidity and mortality among men. Despite a few studies done regarding the disease burden, the evidence is scarce about the survival and prognostic determinants of prostate cancer patients in Ethiopia. Thus, this study assessed the survival and prognostic determinants of patients with prostate cancer.  Methods:   We retrospectively followed patients who were newly diagnosed from 2012 to 2016 at the Oncology Department of Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital. We extracted the data from patient charts that were available in the cancer registry using a checklist with the help of oncology nurses. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses with the log-rank test were used to estimate and compare the probability of survival among covariate categories. After checking for assumptions, a multivariable Cox regression analysis was performed to identify prognostic determinants of survival.  Results:   The median survival time was 28 months with an overall 2-, 3- and 5-year survival of 57%, 38.9% and 22%, respectively. The overall survival differs according to the clinical stage (P-value<0.01), presence or absence of distant metastasis (P<0.01) and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (P<0.05). Cancer stage at diagnosis (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) = 0.309, 95%CI = 0.151-0.633) and ADT (AHR = 3.884, 95%CI = 1.677-8.997) remained significant in the final Cox proportional hazards model.  Conclusions:   The overall 2-, 3- and 5-year survival of prostate cancer patients in Ethiopia is very low. The cancer stage at diagnosis and treatment modalities are significant prognostic determinants of survival. Therefore, early detection through screening and timely initiation of treatment are essential to improve the survival of prostate cancer patients.""","""['Jemal Beksisa', 'Tewodros Getinet', 'Sisay Tanie', 'Jilcha Diribi', 'Hamid Yimam Hassen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Survival Status of Esophageal Cancer Patients and its Determinants in Ethiopia: A Facility Based Retrospective Cohort Study.', 'Survival Status and Predictors of Mortality Among Colorectal Cancer Patients in Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia: A Retrospective Followup Study.', 'Histological characteristics, survival pattern and prognostic determinants among colorectal cancer patients in Ethiopia: A retrospective cohort study.', 'Preterm Neonatal Mortality and its predictors in Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia: a retrospective cohort study.', 'The need for androgen deprivation therapy in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with dose-escalated external beam radiation therapy.', 'Esophageal and Head and Neck Cancer Patients Attending Ocean Road Cancer Institute in Tanzania from 2019 to 2021: An Observational Study.', 'Prostate Cancer Screening Practice and Associated Factors Among Men in Public Health Facilities of Hossana Town, Ethiopia.', 'Mapping Evidence on the Burden of Breast, Cervical, and Prostate Cancers in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Scoping Review.', 'Data on histological characteristics, survival patterns and determinants of mortality among colorectal, esophageal and prostate cancer patients in Ethiopia.', 'Survival Status of Esophageal Cancer Patients and its Determinants in Ethiopia: A Facility Based Retrospective Cohort Study.']"""

Patients and methods:   In a Local CRPC cohort, 42 prostatic specimens were collected from patients who were diagnosed as CRPC and underwent transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). In a metastatic CRPC (Met CRPC) cohort, 12 metastatic biopsies were collected from CRPC patients who would be treated with abiraterone plus dutasteride (Clinical Trial NCT01393730). As controls, 36 benign prostatic specimens were collected from patients undergoing prostate reduction surgery for symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The methylation status of cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) site(s) at SRD5A2 promoter regions was tested.  Results:   Compared with benign prostatic tissue, CRPC samples demonstrated higher SRD5A2 methylation in the whole promoter region (Local CRPC cohort: P < 0.001; Met CRPC cohort: P <0.05). In Local CRPC cohort, a higher ratio of methylation was correlated with better OS (R2 = 0.33, P = 0.013). Hypermethylation of specific regions (nucleotides -434 to -4 [CpG# -39 to CpG# -2]) was associated with a better OS (11.3±5.8 vs 6.4±4.4 years, P = 0.001) and PFS (8.4±5.4 vs 4.5±3.9 years, P = 0.003) with cutoff value of 37.9%.

Objective:   We aimed to establish docetaxel resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cell lines (DU145/TXR, PC-3/TXR, and CWR22/TXR) and characterized transcriptional changes upon acquiring resistance to the docetaxel.  Methods:   Human PC cells (DU145, PC-3, CWR22) and all docetaxel-resistant cells were maintained in Roswell Park Memorial Institute Medium (RPMI) 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. ABCB1 was detected by using both parental and docetaxel-resistant CRPCs prepared for flow cytometry. For the evaluation of tumor-suppressive effects under each chemotherapeutic agent, subcutaneous xenografts of DU145 or DU145/TXR were implanted at the mouse flank.  Results:   The P-glycoprotein-encoding gene ABCB1 was distinctively upregulated in the resistant cells, and its overexpression played an essential role in docetaxel resistance in CRPC. When tested for the cytotoxicity of gemcitabine, another option for chemotherapy, the docetaxel-resistant cells were shown to become sensitive to the drug, implying additional phenotypic transformation in the docetaxel-resistant cells. Studies using xenograft animal models demonstrated that the growth of tumors composed of both docetaxel-sensitive and docetaxel-resistant cells was deterred most profoundly when docetaxel and gemcitabine were administered together.

Recently, a peripheral inflammatory index, combining the derived neutrophils/(leukocytes minus neutrophils) ratio (dNLR) and the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, was proposed as a useful prognostic marker in advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer. The prognostic value of inflammatory markers in prostate cancer has not been established. We aimed to validate the prognostic significance of this peripheral inflammatory index in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Methods:   Clinical data of 196 mCRPC patients were retrospectively collected from multiple institutions. Clinical factors and inflammatory markers at the development of CRPC, including white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, dNLR, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein (CRP), and LDH levels, were evaluated. The patients were classified into three groups based on the inflammatory index: Good (low dNLR and LDH), Intermediate (high dNLR or LDH), and Poor (high dNLR and LDH). Overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival after CRPC were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard models and Kaplan-Meier methods.  Results:   The median age and baseline prostate-specific antigen level were 75 years and 397.15 ng/mL, respectively. On multivariate analysis, dNLR (≥1.51; hazard ratio [HR] = 1.624; P = .0173), LDH (≥upper limit of normal; HR = 2.065; P = .0004), alkaline phosphatase (≥310 U/L; HR = 2.546; P < .0001), and positive N stage (HR = 1.621; P = .048) were associated with poor OS after CRPC, whereas other inflammatory markers including the NLR were not. The Good inflammatory index group showed significantly longer OS after CRPC compared to the Intermediate and Poor groups, with median survivals of 46.2, 28.9, and 16.6 months, respectively.  Conclusions:   The novel inflammatory index combining dNLR and LDH was a useful prognostic parameter in patients with mCRPC.

Among all cancer survivors, patients with diabetes had greater risk of: all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1.35, 95% CI = 1.27-1.43], cancer-specific mortality (HR: 1.14, 95% CI = 1.03-1.27), CVD mortality (HR: 1.36, 95% CI = 1.18-1.55), diabetes related mortality (HR: 17.18, 95% CI = 11.51-25.64), and kidney disease mortality (HR: 2.51, 95% CI = 1.65-3.82), compared with individuals without diabetes. The risk of all-cause mortality was also higher amongst those with diabetes and specific types of cancer: breast cancer (HR: 1.28, 95% CI = 1.12-1.48), prostate cancer (HR: 1.20, 95% CI = 1.03-1.39), and colorectal cancer (HR: 1.29, 95% CI = 1.10-1.50). Diabetes increased the risk of cancer-specific mortality among colorectal cancer survivors (HR: 1.36, 95% CI = 1.04-1.78) compared to those without diabetes. Diabetes was associated with higher risk of diabetes-related mortality when compared to non-diabetic breast (HR: 9.20, 95% CI = 3.60-23.53), prostate (HR: 18.36, 95% CI = 6.01-56.11), and colorectal cancer survivors (HR: 12.18, 95% CI = 4.17-35.58). Both pre- and post-diagnosis diabetes increased the risk of all-cause mortality among all cancer survivors. Cancer survivors with diabetes had similar risk of all-cause and CVD mortality during the second 5 years of diabetes and above 10 years of diabetes as compared to non-diabetic patients. Conclusions: Diabetes increased the risk of all-cause mortality among breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer survivors, not for pre- or post-diagnosis diabetes. Greater attention on diabetes management is warranted in cancer survivors with diabetes.""","""['Huan Tao', ""Adrienne O'Neil"", 'Yunseon Choi', 'Wei Wang', 'Junfeng Wang', 'Yafeng Wang', 'Yongqian Jia', 'Xiong Chen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)""","""['All-Cause and Cardiovascular Disease Mortality Among Breast Cancer Survivors in CLUE II, a Long-Standing Community-Based Cohort.', 'Neighborhood and Individual Socioeconomic Disadvantage and Survival Among Patients With Nonmetastatic Common Cancers.', 'Clopidogrel use and cancer-specific mortality: a population-based cohort study of colorectal, breast and prostate cancer patients.', 'Trends in the prevalence of malignancy among patients admitted with acute heart failure and associated outcomes: a nationwide population-based study.', 'Physical activity, risk of death and recurrence in breast cancer survivors: A systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological studies.', 'Association of dietary sodium intake with impaired fasting glucose in adult cancer survivors: A population-based cross-sectional study.', 'Hyperglycemia and Glycemic Variability Associated with Glucocorticoids in Women without Pre-Existing Diabetes Undergoing Neoadjuvant or Adjuvant Taxane Chemotherapy for Early-Stage Breast Cancer.', 'Impact of Cardiovascular Diseases on Mortality in Gastric Cancer Patients with Preexisting Chronic Disease.', 'Effect of glycated hemoglobin A1c on the survival of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma: A multi-institutional database cohort study.', 'Behavioral Research in Cancer Prevention and Control: Emerging Challenges and Opportunities.']"""

Given that selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are used to treat breast cancer, ERs have been proposed as attractive therapeutic targets in PCa. However, many inconsistencies regarding the expression of ERs and the efficacy of SERMs for PCa treatment exist, notably due to the use of ERβ antibodies lacking specificity and treatments with high SERM concentrations leading to off-target effects. To end this confusion, our objective was to study the impact of estrogenic and anti-estrogenic ligands in well-studied in vitro PCa models with appropriate controls, dosages, and ER subtype-specific antibodies. When using physiologically relevant concentrations of nine estrogenic/anti-estrogenic compounds, including five SERMs, we observed no significant modulation of PCa cell proliferation. Using RNA-seq and validated antibodies, we demonstrate that these PCa models do not express ERs. In contrast, RNA-seq from PCa samples from patients have detectable expression of ERα. Overall, our study reveals that commonly used PCa models are inappropriate to study ERs and indicate that usage of alternative models is essential to properly assess the roles of the estrogen signaling pathway in PCa.""","""['Camille Lafront', 'Lucas Germain', 'Cindy Weidmann', 'Étienne Audet-Walsh']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Expression and regulation of the estrogen receptors in PC-3 human prostate cancer cells.', 'Cell proliferation and modulation of interaction of estrogen receptors with coregulators induced by ERα and ERβ agonists.', 'Estrogen and the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) protection against cell death in estrogen receptor alpha and beta expressing U2OS cells.', 'Regulation of specific target genes and biological responses by estrogen receptor subtype agonists.', 'Molecular mechanisms of estrogen action: selective ligands and receptor pharmacology.', 'The Transcriptomic Profiles of ESR1 and MMP3 Stratify the Risk of Biochemical Recurrence in Primary Prostate Cancer beyond Clinical Features.', 'The Role of ERα and ERβ in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer and Current Therapeutic Approaches.', 'Molecular regulation of prostate cancer by Galectin-3 and estrogen receptor.', 'Cell Uptake of Steroid-BODIPY Conjugates and Their Internalization Mechanisms: Cancer Theranostic Dyes.', 'Mechanisms of Prostate Cancer Cells Survival and Their Therapeutic Targeting.']"""

Methods:   We retrieved data of men aged 30 years or older who were newly diagnosed with heart failure between January 1998 and December 2003 from the National Health Insurance program database in Taiwan. We divided the patients into digoxin users and non-digoxin users. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard analysis were used to examine the risk of subsequent PCa between the digoxin and non-digoxin groups.  Results:   The mean ± SD follow-up (years) periods in the digoxin and non-digoxin groups were 8.6 ± 1.78 and 8.3 ± 1.75, respectively. The cumulative incidence of PCa during the follow-up period was 3.5% (147/4233) in the non-digoxin group compared with 3.0% (65/2154) in the digoxin group. The log-rank test revealed that the digoxin group had a similar incidence of PCa to the non-digoxin group (p = 0.18). After adjusting for age, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and comorbidities, Cox proportional hazard regression analysis showed that digoxin was associated with a significantly decreased risk of developing PCa (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.548-0.993; p = 0.045). Moreover, logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of PCa decreased with a longer duration of digoxin use during the study period compared to those who had never used digoxin (p = 0.043).  Conclusion:   The cardiac glycoside digoxin had significant effects on reducing the incidence of PCa in a time-dependent manner.

Although VEGFR2 was mainly downregulated in the PCa cohort of the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database, VEGFR2 was upregulated in our high-risk PCa cohort (n = 142) and predicted clinical progression. In vitro miR-221-3p acted as an escape mechanism from TKI in PC3 cells, as displayed by proliferation and apoptosis assays. Moreover, we confirmed that Sunitinib induced an interferon-related gene signature in PC3 cells by analyzing external microarray data and by demonstrating a significant upregulation of miR-221-3p/miR-222-3p after Sunitinib exposure.

Grade group 1 refers to clinically insignificant disease; grade group 2 or higher, cancer with favorable intermediate risk or worse; and grade group 3 or higher, cancer with unfavorable intermediate risk or worse. Among the men who underwent subsequent radical prostatectomy, upgrading and downgrading of grade group from biopsy to whole-mount histopathological analysis of surgical specimens were recorded. Secondary outcomes were the detection of cancers of grade group 2 or higher and grade group 3 or higher, cancer detection stratified by previous biopsy status, and grade reclassification between biopsy and radical prostatectomy.  Results:   A total of 2103 men underwent both biopsy methods; cancer was diagnosed in 1312 (62.4%) by a combination of the two methods (combined biopsy), and 404 (19.2%) underwent radical prostatectomy. Cancer detection rates on MRI-targeted biopsy were significantly lower than on systematic biopsy for grade group 1 cancers and significantly higher for grade groups 3 through 5 (P<0.01 for all comparisons). Combined biopsy led to cancer diagnoses in 208 more men (9.9%) than with either method alone and to upgrading to a higher grade group in 458 men (21.8%). However, if only MRI-target biopsies had been performed, 8.8% of clinically significant cancers (grade group ≥3) would have been misclassified. Among the 404 men who underwent subsequent radical prostatectomy, combined biopsy was associated with the fewest upgrades to grade group 3 or higher on histopathological analysis of surgical specimens (3.5%), as compared with MRI-targeted biopsy (8.7%) and systematic biopsy (16.8%).  Conclusions:   Among patients with MRI-visible lesions, combined biopsy led to more detection of all prostate cancers. However, MRI-targeted biopsy alone underestimated the histologic grade of some tumors. After radical prostatectomy, upgrades to grade group 3 or higher on histopathological analysis were substantially lower after combined biopsy.

Gene Ontology analysis and pathway enrichment analysis were conducted for functional annotation, and a protein-protein interaction network was built. Samples from the International Cancer Genomics Consortium database were used as a validation set. The turquoise module showed the most relevance with lymph node metastasis. Functional annotation showed that biological processes and pathways were mainly related to activation of the processes of cell cycle and mitosis. Four hub genes were selected: CKAP2L, CDCA8, ERCC6L and ARPC1A. Further validation showed that the four hub genes well-distinguished tumour and normal tissues, and they were good biomarkers for lymph node metastasis of PCa.

Methods:   We used data from German epidemiologic cancer registries for the years 2009-2013. Presence of a certified cancer center, a radiotherapy and/or urology institution, the district-specific GDP, and population density were used as predictors. Patients with indication for adjuvant treatment were excluded (T3b). Only districts with defined quality criteria were eligible. We used general linear mixed models (equivalent to logistic regression) with a covariance matrix weighted by the Euclidean distances between districts. Models were adjusted for age, grading, and TNM stage. We performed sensitivity analyses by imputing missing data with multiple imputation and considering extreme case scenarios. We applied inverse probability weighting to account for missing values.  Results:   When radiotherapy/surgery is compared to neither treatment, the probability for the latter was higher in East than in West Germany (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.43-2.02). The same was true for districts with both, a radiotherapy and urologic treatment facility (OR 1.43, 1.19-1.72). Analyzing radiotherapy vs. surgery, the probability for prostatectomy was inversely associated with the presence of a radiotherapy unit when compared to districts with neither treatment facility (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.38-0.73). Patients treated in East Germany were more likely to receive a surgical treatment (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.08-1.66). Sensitivity analyses revealed no relevant change of effect estimates.

However, comparative analyses focused on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) after RARP and open retropubic prostatectomy (ORP) are sparse.  Methods:   In the current retrospective analysis, inclusion criteria encompassed PSA ≤ 10 ng/ml, ≤ pT2c, ISUP ≤ 3, age ≤ 65 years, and preoperative continence. A propensity score-matched patient cohort [n = 418 (ORP: 209, RARP: 209)] was created and HRQOL was prospectively assessed based on validated questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30) preoperatively, 3 months, 12 months, and 24 months postoperatively. Primary endpoint was good general HRQOL based on previously published cut-off values. Erectile function was measured via IIEF-5, urinary continence via ICIQ-SF questionnaire. Multivariable analysis included binary logistic regression models (p < 0.05).  Results:   Open retropubic prostatectomy and RARP cohorts were well balanced. General HRQOL was significantly higher for ORP compared to RARP after 3 months (70.1 vs. 61.6, p = 0.001), but not at the remaining follow-up time points. There were no significant differences for the remaining QLQ-C30 functioning and symptom scores. In multivariable analysis stratified for IIEF-5 and ICIQ-SF scores and surgeon experience, RARP could be confirmed as a marginally independent predictor for lower ratios of good general HRQOL after 3 months (OR 0.464, 95% CI 0.215-0.999; p = 0.050) without any differences at the remaining time points.  Conclusions:   The current study addresses various HRQOL outcomes over a postoperative period of up to 2 years in a homogenous propensity score-matched contemporary cohort.

An artificial intelligence based investigation of prostate cancer trajectories""","""Background:   Online Cancer Support Groups (OCSG) are becoming an increasingly vital source of information, experiences and empowerment for patients with cancer. Despite significant contributions to physical, psychological and emotional wellbeing of patients, OCSG are yet to be formally recognised and used in multidisciplinary cancer support programs. This study highlights the opportunity of using Artificial Intelligence (AI) in OCSG to address psychological morbidity, with supporting empirical evidence from prostate cancer (PCa) patients.  Methods:   A validated framework of AI techniques and Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, was used to investigate PCa patient activities based on conversations in ten international OCSG (18,496 patients- 277,805 conversations). The specific focus was on activities that indicate psychological morbidity; the reasons for joining OCSG, deep emotions and the variation from joining through to milestones in the cancer trajectory. Comparative analyses were conducted using t-tests, One-way ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer post-hoc analysis.  Findings:   PCa patients joined OCSG at four key phases of psychological distress; diagnosis, treatment, side-effects, and recurrence, the majority group was 'treatment' (61.72%). The four groups varied in expression of the intense emotional burden of cancer. The 'side-effects' group expressed increased negative emotions during the first month compared to other groups (p<0.01). A comparison of pre-treatment vs post-treatment emotions showed that joining pre-treatment had significantly lower negative emotions after 12-months compared to post-treatment (p<0.05). Long-term deep emotion analysis reveals that all groups except 'recurrence' improved in emotional wellbeing.  Conclusion:   This is the first empirical study of psychological morbidity and deep emotions expressed by men with a new diagnosis of cancer, using AI. PCa patients joining pre-treatment had improved emotions, and long-term participation in OCSG led to an increase in emotional wellbeing, indicating a decrease in psychological distress. It is opportune to further investigate AI in OCSG for early psychological intervention as an adjunct to conventional intervention programs.""","""['Achini Adikari', 'Daswin de Silva', 'Weranja K B Ranasinghe', 'Tharindu Bandaragoda', 'Oshadi Alahakoon', 'Raj Persad', 'Nathan Lawrentschuk', 'Damminda Alahakoon', 'Damien Bolton']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""[""You've got a friend online."", 'Emotions of COVID-19: Content Analysis of Self-Reported Information Using Artificial Intelligence.', 'The Patient-Reported Information Multidimensional Exploration (PRIME) Framework for Investigating Emotions and Other Factors of Prostate Cancer Patients with Low Intermediate Risk Based on Online Cancer Support Group Discussions.', 'Machine learning to support social media empowered patients in cancer care and cancer treatment decisions.', 'Emotional and cognitive burden of prostate cancer.', 'Online support groups for women with breast cancer.', 'Mental Health of Prostate Cancer Patients: Content Review on YouTubeTM.', 'An artificial intelligence life cycle: From conception to production.', 'A Mental Health Chatbot with Cognitive Skills for Personalised Behavioural Activation and Remote Health Monitoring.', 'Prostate Cancer Support Groups: The Unadvertised Camaraderie.', 'Emotions of COVID-19: Content Analysis of Self-Reported Information Using Artificial Intelligence.']"""

We evaluated the GPS test as a predictor of outcomes in a multicenter active surveillance cohort.  Materials and methods:   Diagnostic biopsy tissue was obtained from men enrolled at 8 sites in the Canary Prostate Active Surveillance Study. The primary endpoint was AP (Gleason Grade Group [GG] ≥ 3, ≥ pT3a) in men who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) after initial surveillance. Multivariable regression models for interval-censored data were used to evaluate the association between AP and GPS. Inverse probability of censoring weighting was applied to adjust for informative censoring. Predictiveness curves were used to evaluate how models stratified risk of AP. Association between GPS and time to upgrade on surveillance biopsy was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models.  Results:   GPS results were obtained for 432 men (median follow-up, 4.6 years); 101 underwent RP after a median 2.1 years of surveillance, and 52 had AP. A total of 167 men (39%) upgraded at a subsequent biopsy. GPS was significantly associated with AP when adjusted for diagnostic GG (hazards ratio [HR]/5 GPS units, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.44; P = .030), but not when also adjusted for prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD; HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 0.99 to 4.19; P = .066). Models containing PSAD and GG, or PSAD, GG, and GPS may stratify risk better than a model with GPS and GG. No association was observed between GPS and subsequent biopsy upgrade (P = .48).  Conclusion:   In our study, the independent association of GPS with AP after initial active surveillance was not statistically significant, and there was no association with upgrading in surveillance biopsy.

The objective of our study was to determine the performance of 3-T multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) for prostate cancer (PCa) detection and localization, stratified by anatomic zone and level, using Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2 (PI-RADSv2) and whole-mount histopathology (WMHP) as reference. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Multiparametric MRI examinations of 415 consecutive men were compared with thin-section WMHP results. A genitourinary radiologist and pathologist collectively determined concordance. Two radiologists assigned PI-RADSv2 scores and sector location to all detected foci by consensus. Tumor detection rates were calculated for clinical and pathologic (tumor location and zone) variables. Both rigid and adjusted sector-matching models were used to account for fixation-related issues. RESULTS. Of 863 PCa foci in 16,185 prostate sectors, the detection of overall and index PCa lesions in the midgland, base, and apex was 54.9% and 83.1%, 42.1% and 64.0% (p = 0.04, p = 0.02), and 41.9% and 71.4% (p = 0.001, p = 0.006), respectively. Tumor localization sensitivity was highest in the midgland compared with the base and apex using an adjusted match compared with a rigid match (index lesions, 71.3% vs 43.7%; all lesions, 70.8% vs 36.0%) and was greater in the peripheral zone (PZ) than in the transition zone. Three-Tesla mpMRI had similarly high specificity (range, 93.8-98.3%) for overall and index tumor localization when using both rigid and adjusted sector-matching approaches. CONCLUSION. For 3-T mpMRI, the highest sensitivity (83.1%) for detection of index PCa lesions was in the midgland, with 98.3% specificity. Multiparametric MRI performance for sectoral localization of PCa within the prostate was moderate and was best for index lesions in the PZ using an adjusted model.""","""['Pornphan Wibulpolprasert', 'Steven S Raman', 'William Hsu', 'Daniel J A Margolis', 'Nazanin H Asvadi', 'Pooria Khoshnoodi', 'Amin Moshksar', 'Nelly Tan', 'Preeti Ahuja', 'Cleo K Maehara', 'Anthony Sisk', 'James Sayre', 'David S K Lu', 'Robert E Reiter']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""AJR Am J Roentgenol""","""['Detection and Localization of Prostate Cancer at 3-T Multiparametric MRI Using PI-RADS Segmentation.', 'Detectability of prostate cancer in different parts of the gland with 3-Tesla multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging: correlation with whole-mount histopathology.', '3T multiparametric MR imaging, PIRADSv2-based detection of index prostate cancer lesions in the transition zone and the peripheral zone using whole mount histopathology as reference standard.', 'Characteristics of missed prostate cancer lesions on 3T multiparametric-MRI in 518 patients: based on PI-RADSv2 and using whole-mount histopathology reference.', 'Positive Predictive Value of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2 for the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Differences in the pathogenetic characteristics of prostate cancer in the transitional and peripheral zones and the possible molecular biological mechanisms.', 'Racial Disparities in Quantitative MRI for African American and White Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'An independent practice validation of the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2 scoring system and the introduction of PDP (prostate-specific antigen density × PI-RADSv2) score to assist with further risk assessment.', 'The diagnostic accuracy of multiparametric MRI for detection and localization of prostate cancer depends on the affected region.']"""

Studies to date have yet to employ quantitative methods (qPTEN) for measuring of prognostically relevant amounts of PTEN loss in postsurgical settings and demonstrate its clinical application.  Methods:   PTEN protein levels were measured by immunohistochemistry in radical prostatectomy samples from training (n = 410) and validation (n = 272) cohorts. PTEN loss was quantified per cancer cell and per tissue microarray core. Thresholds for identifying clinically relevant PTEN loss were determined using log-rank statistics in the training cohort. Univariate (Kaplan-Meier) and multivariate (Cox proportional hazards) analyses on various subpopulations were performed to assess biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS) and were independently validated. All statistical tests were two-sided.  Results:   PTEN loss in more than 65% cancer cells was most clinically relevant and had statistically significant association with reduced BRFS in training (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.59 to 3.87; P < .001) and validation cohorts (HR = 4.22, 95% CI = 2.01 to 8.83; P < .001). The qPTEN scoring method identified patients who recurred within 5.4 years after surgery (P < .001). In men with favorable risk of biochemical recurrence (Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment - Postsurgical scores <5 and no adverse pathological features), qPTEN identified a subset of patients with shorter BRFS (HR = 5.52, 95% CI = 2.36 to 12.90; P < .001) who may be considered for intensified monitoring and/or adjuvant therapy.

Materials and methods:   Forty-two patients who underwent RT ± hormone therapy for PCa between 2010 and 2013 were analyzed. Sexual functions assessed by patient-reported questionnaire and physician reported scale before and 3 years after treatment. The effect of patients' age, prostate volume, testosterone levels, comorbidity, smoking status, tumor stage, RT technique, hormone therapy, and PB doses to sexual functions were investigated.  Results:   After 3 years of RT, 64.3% of all patients had a lower erectile score; and 75% of patients who were previously potent (n = 24) had become impotent after treatment. However sexual desire still remained in 75.8% of patients who had desire before treatment (n = 33). Statistical analysis showed that two parameters were correlated with postradiotherapy impotency outcome; PB mean radiation dose (P = 0.033) and testosterone levels (P = 0.032).

Mishel's uncertainty in illness theory (UIT) proposes that illness uncertainty influences an individual's use of coping strategies, and directly and indirectly influences their QOL. This study tested the relationships depicted in the adapted UIT in cancer patients.  Methods:   This cross-sectional study is a secondary analysis of the baseline data from a randomized clinical trial (N = 263 prostate cancer patients). Patients were diagnosed with localized (64.6%), biochemical recurrent (12.6%), or advanced (22.8%) prostate cancer. Uncertainty, coping (avoidant and active coping strategies), and QOL (physical and mental well-being) were measured using the Mishel's uncertainty of illness scale, Brief COPE, and the Medical Outcomes Study 12-item short form (SF-12), respectively. We used path analysis to achieve the research aim.  Results:   Patients' illness uncertainty directly, negatively influenced their physical well-being (P < .001) and mental well-being (P < .05). Patients' illness uncertainty was positively related to their avoidant coping strategies (P < .001). Patients' active and avoidant coping strategies influenced their mental well-being (P < .001). Uncertainty also negatively influenced mental well-being through avoidant coping strategies. The model had excellent fit to the data.  Conclusions:   Our findings have indicated the potential of improving QOL by decreasing illness uncertainty and reducing avoidant coping strategies.

Although localized prostate cancer was discovered incidentally, the etiology of paraaortic lymphadenopathy was assumed to be metastatic HCC. Lenvatinib 12 mg/day was started when his thyroid function tests were almost normal but was interrupted because of thyrotoxicosis. The patient was negative for tested thyroid autoantibodies. Color Doppler ultrasonography detected reduced thyroid blood flow, suggesting destructive thyroiditis. Although he resumed lenvatinib at 8 mg/day once his serum level of free thyroxine normalized, thyrotoxicosis recurred. Subsequently, he suffered hypothyroidism, which exacerbated despite levothyroxine replacement. Lenvatinib was discontinued as it was ineffective against the paraaortic lymph node metastasis, and external-beam radiotherapy was performed. After the completion of radiotherapy, the thyroid dysfunction significantly improved.

The molecular mechanism of PVTT formation is not totally clarified, the invasion of blood vessels by liver cancer cells is the key step and portal vein endothelial cells plays critical role. Methods: Conditioned medium (CM) of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were used to culture liver cancer cells and prostate cancer cells for cell motility and viability analysis for the purpose of simulating the role of macrovascular endothelial cells in the development of liver cancer. Results: HUVEC-CM caused long spindle-shaped changes in liver cancer cells; the invasion and migration ability of Bel-7402 and MHCC-LM3 (cultured in HUVEC-CM) increased significantly. Integrins/FAK (focal adhesion kinase) signaling pathway was activated and MMP-3 was up-regulated. However, classical epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) did not involve. HUVEC-CM caused a decrease of cell population in G1- and S-phase of Bel-7402, it also caused an accumulation of cell population in G1 phase and a decrease of cell population in S-phase of MHCC-LM3, MHCC-97L and DU-145. HUVEC-CM promotes apoptosis of Bel-7402 and MHCC-97L and the nude mouse tumorigenic experiment did not find that the HUVEC-CM increase the tumorigenic ability of liver cancer cells.

Tumor expression of SLFN11 was assessed in 41 patients with CRPC treated with platinum chemotherapy by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of metastatic biopsy tissue (n = 27) and/or immunofluorescence in circulating tumor cells (CTC; n = 20). Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier methods were used to evaluate the association of SLFN11 expression with radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS). Multivariate analysis included tumor histology (i.e., adenocarcinoma or neuroendocrine) and the presence or absence of DNA repair aberrations. Patient-derived organoids with SLFN11 expression and after knockout by CRISPR-Cas9 were treated with platinum and assessed for changes in dose response. Patients were treated with platinum combination (N = 38) or platinum monotherapy (N = 3). Median lines of prior therapy for CRPC was two. Median OS was 8.7 months. Overexpression of SLFN11 in metastatic tumors by RNA-seq was associated with longer rPFS compared with those without overexpression (6.9 vs. 2.8 months, HR = 3.72; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.56-8.87; P < 0.001); similar results were observed for patients with SLFN11-positive versus SLFN11-negative CTCs (rPFS 6.0 vs. 2.2 months, HR = 4.02; 95% CI, 0.77-20.86; P = 0.002). A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline of ≥50% was observed in all patients with SLFN11 overexpression. No association was observed between SLFN11 expression and OS. On multivariable analysis, SLFN11 was an independent factor associated with rPFS on platinum therapy. Platinum response of organoids expressing SLFN11 was reduced after SLFN11 knockout.

ATM is a DDR kinase that has a central role in coordinating DNA repair and cell-cycle response following DNA damage, and ATM alterations are present in approximately 5% of advanced prostate tumors. Recently, inhibitors of PARP have demonstrated activity in advanced prostate tumors harboring DDR gene alterations, particularly in tumors with BRCA1/2 alterations. However, the role of alterations in DDR genes beyond BRCA1/2 in mediating PARP inhibitor sensitivity is poorly understood. To define the role of ATM loss in prostate tumor DDR function and sensitivity to DDR-directed agents, we created a series of ATM-deficient preclinical prostate cancer models and tested the impact of ATM loss on DNA repair function and therapeutic sensitivities. ATM loss altered DDR signaling, but did not directly impact homologous recombination function. Furthermore, ATM loss did not significantly impact sensitivity to PARP inhibition but robustly sensitized to inhibitors of the related DDR kinase ATR. These results have important implications for planned and ongoing prostate cancer clinical trials and suggest that patients with tumor ATM alterations may be more likely to benefit from ATR inhibitor than PARP inhibitor therapy. SIGNIFICANCE: ATM loss occurs in a subset of prostate tumors. This study shows that deleting ATM in prostate cancer models does not significantly increase sensitivity to PARP inhibition but does sensitize to ATR inhibition.See related commentary by Setton and Powell, p. 2085.""","""['Shahrzad Rafiei', 'Kenyon Fitzpatrick', 'David Liu', 'Mu-Yan Cai', 'Haitham A Elmarakeby', 'Jihye Park', 'Cora Ricker', 'Bose S Kochupurakkal', 'Atish D Choudhury', 'William C Hahn', 'Steven P Balk', 'Justin H Hwang', 'Eliezer M Van Allen', 'Kent W Mouw']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Moving beyond PARP Inhibition in ATM-Deficient Prostate Cancer.', 'Moving beyond PARP Inhibition in ATM-Deficient Prostate Cancer.', 'Advanced Prostate Cancer with ATM Loss: PARP and ATR Inhibitors.', 'Loss of DNA Damage Response in Neuroblastoma and Utility of a PARP Inhibitor.', 'Targeting DNA Damage Response in Prostate and Breast Cancer.', 'Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinases as therapeutic targets and stratification indicators for prostate cancer.', 'Use of poly ADP-ribose polymerase PARP inhibitors in cancer cells bearing DDR defects: the rationale for their inclusion in the clinic.', 'DNA Repair Inhibitors: Potential Targets and Partners for Targeted Radionuclide Therapy.', 'Discovery of 1,2,3Triazolo4,5-cquinoline Derivatives as a New Class of Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated Kinase Inhibitors.', 'APOBEC3B coordinates R-loop to promote replication stress and sensitize cancer cells to ATR/Chk1 inhibitors.', 'Harnessing transcriptionally driven chromosomal instability adaptation to target therapy-refractory lethal prostate cancer.', 'Combining targeted DNA repair inhibition and immune-oncology approaches for enhanced tumor control.']"""

International multicenter study of 3350 patients""","""Introduction:   Prostate cancer is the most common visceral neoplasm in men and the second one in the United States with the highest mortality behind lung cancer and ahead of colorectal cancer. While prostate cancer mortality rates have been reduced in the United States, Austria, United Kingdom and France, 5-year survival rates have been incremented in Sweden, probably due to a higher diagnostic activity and non-lethal tumor detection. TRPB usually has low rates of serious complications, with a not negligible number of minor complications. Mortality directly associated with this procedure is low and usually related to septic shock. The main complications derived from prostate biopsy can be infectious (mild or severe) and non-infectious (hematuria consistent with hemorrhage, urethral bleeding, rectal bleeding or hemospermia, acute urinary retention, pain or vasovagal reactions).  Material and method:   The objective of the study is to compare three usual TRPB protocols and their relationship with the incidence of complications. Retrospective multicenter observational study conducted in three countries (Spain, Italy and Portugal). We have reviewed the medical records of 3350 men who underwent TRPB to evaluate the existence of prostate cancer, with a minimum evolutionary control of 6months.  Results:   The mean age was 65,50years, median 66, range 43-79. The subgroup analysis showed that younger patients had higher rates of acute urine retention (AUR) (P=.0000001). Likewise, our results revealed that younger patients presented more procedural pain (P=.0000001) than older patients. Regarding PSA, the mean value was 10.44, SD 7.73, median 8.15, range 0.98-68.09. A higher body mass index (BMI) was not associated with further infection (P=.000004). When performing the multivariate analysis, it was found that the significant variables in the general group were: age (P=.0013), PSA (P=.0402), local infiltration anesthesia (P=.0001) and prophylaxis with metronidazole +tobramycin +amoxicillin/clavulanic acid +gentamicin (P=.0001), presenting a normal distribution with high confidence interval (95%) and significant correlation. Prophylaxis is the most significant variable for no complications and pain (P=.0001), age (P=.0013) and prophylaxis (P=.0001) are for bleeding, age (P=.0013), prophylaxis and PSA (P=.0001) are for infection, and finally, age (P=.0013), anesthesia with local infiltration and prophylaxis (P=.0001) and PSA (P=.0402) are for AUR.  Conclusions:   Sedation has fewer side effects and complications related to the transrectal prostate biopsy procedure with respect to transrectal local anesthesia. The choice of the antibiotic prophylaxis scheme is decisive in the onset of complications arising from the performance of a transrectal prostate biopsy.""","""['M Perán Teruel', 'M F Lorenzo-Gómez', 'N Veiga Canuto', 'B Y Padilla-Fernández', 'L S Valverde-Martínez', 'F Migliorini', 'B Jorge Pereira', 'H M Pires Coelho', 'J M Osca García']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Actas Urol Esp (Engl Ed)""","""['Comparison of Single and Prolonged Fluoroquinolone Prophylaxis and Risk Factors for Infectious Complications After Transrectal Prostate Biopsy.', 'Efficacy and safety of fosfomycin-trometamol in the prophylaxis for transrectal prostate biopsy.

However, this method is complex and take a long time to analyze. To overcome these disadvantages, many immuno-sensing chips have been designed and developed. However, these devices still require an external pump or electrical source. In this study, our group fabricated a capillary microfluidic device using glass and adhesive polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film, which were designed by simply patterning and cutting to make the microfluidic capillary channels. Using capillary force alone, glass microfluidic chip can control the speed of fluid-flow and the flow sequence by adjusting the width of the channel and design. In addition, each flow can push out other flow without mixing. The glass-based capillary microfluidic chip (GCMC) can automatically perform immunoassay in regular order without external devices and it provide an electrochemical signal analysis in an average of 2 min. The concentration of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a biomarker of prostate cancer, was measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV). In conclusion, GCMC can detect between a range of 100 pg/ml to 1 μg/ml of PSA and provide high selectivity to PSA.""","""['Myeong Jun Lee', 'Jina Yeom', 'Jin-Ha Choi', 'Jeong Hyeop Shin', 'Tae Hwan Kim', 'Ju-Won Jeon', 'Jeong-Geol Na', 'Kwanwoo Shin', 'Byung-Keun Oh']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Nanosci Nanotechnol""","""['SERS-Based Pump-Free Microfluidic Chip for Highly Sensitive Immunoassay of Prostate-Specific Antigen Biomarkers.', 'An integrated magnetic microfluidic chip for rapid immunodetection of the prostate specific antigen using immunomagnetic beads.', 'An integrated lab-on-a-chip-based electrochemical biosensor for rapid and sensitive detection of cancer biomarkers.', 'Fabrication, Flow Control, and Applications of Microfluidic Paper-Based Analytical Devices.', 'Microfluidic Paper-Based Analytical Devices: From Design to Applications.', 'Pumpless three-dimensional photo paper-based microfluidic analytical device for automatic detection of thioredoxin-1 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.']"""

In 2010, ""Prostate Cancer: Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment in West Africa"" was first published. Since then, there have been several developments in diagnosis and management of prostate cancer. These need to be incorporated to produce a 2019 update. The aspiration is that it will serve as a benchmark for the basic standard of care for patients with prostate cancer in West Africa or even as a working document for the development of guidelines for treatment of prostate cancer by urological associations, other professional societies, institutions or government.  Methods:   A search of the literature was performed to identify recent studies. Those of relevance to West Africa, were extracted for evaluation to enable update of the recommendations.  Results:   There are three themes (screening/diagnosis, clinical pathology, treatment) with 20 guideline topics covering screening, diagnosis, staging, grading, classification and management. New evidence in screening, definition of normal prostate-specific antigen, and use of pre-biopsy magnetic resonance imaging, have been incorporated.  Conclusion:   This update will serve as a benchmark to assist clinicians in achieving best practice in the management of prostate cancer.

Patients and methods:   We selected 1837 patients with ISUP GG1 or GG2 prostate cancer (PCa), treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) between 2012 and 2018. The outcome of interest was the presence of unfavourable disease (i.e., clinically significant PCa [csPCa]) at RP, defined as: ISUP GG ≥ 3 and/or pathological T stage (pT) ≥3a and/or pathological N stage (pN) 1. First, logistic regression models including PRIAS, JH, EAU low-risk, and EAU low-risk or low-volume ISUP GG2 binary classifications (not eligible vs eligible) were used. Second, a multivariable logistic regression model including age, prostate-specific antigen density (PSA-D), ISUP GG, and the percentage of positive cores (Model 1) was fitted. Third, Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score (Model 2), extracapsular extension (ECE) score (Model 3) and PI-RADS + ECE score (Model 4) were added to Model 1. Only variables associated with higher csPCa rates in Model 4 were retained in the final simplified Model 5. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration plots and decision curve analyses were used.  Results:   Of the 1837 patients, 775 (42.2%) had csPCa at RP. Overall, 837 (47.5%), 986 (53.7%), 348 (18.9%), and 209 (11.4%) patients were eligible for AS according to, respectively, the EAU low-risk, EAU low-risk or low-volume ISUP GG2, PRIAS, and JH criteria. The proportion of csPCa amongst the EAU low-risk, EAU low-risk or low-volume ISUP GG2, PRIAS and JH candidates was, respectively 28.5%, 29.3%, 25.6% and 17.2%. Model 4 and Model 5 (in which only PSA-D, ISUP GG, PI-RADS and ECE score were retained) had a greater AUC (0.84), compared to the four proposed AS criteria (all P < 0.001). The adoption of a 25% nomogram threshold increased the proportion of AS-eligible patients from 18.9% (PRIAS) and 11.4% (JH) to 44.4%. Moreover, the same 25% nomogram threshold resulted in significantly lower estimated risks of csPCa (11.3%), compared to PRIAS (Δ: -14.3%), JH (Δ: -5.9%), EAU low-risk (Δ: -17.2%), and EAU low-risk or low-volume ISUP GG2 classifications (Δ: -18.0%).  Conclusion:   The novel nomogram combining clinical, biopsy and mpMRI findings was able to increase by ~25% and 35% the absolute frequency of patients suitable for AS, compared to, respectively, the PRIAS or JH criteria.

To better understand the role of CEACAM1 in prostate cancer, we analyzed a tissue microarray containing tumor spots from 17,747 prostate cancer patients by means of immunohistochemistry. Normal prostate glands showed intense membranous CEACAM1 positivity. Immunostaining was interpretable in 13,625 cancers and was considered high in 28%, low in 43% and absent in 29% of tumors. Low and lost CEACAM1 expression was strongly linked to adverse tumor features including high classical and quantitative Gleason grade, lymph node metastasis, advanced tumor stage, positive surgical margin, a high number of genomic deletions and early biochemical recurrence (p < 0.0001 each). Subset analysis of molecularly defined cancer subsets revealed that these associations were strongest in V-ets avian erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog (ERG) fusion-positive cancers and that CEACAM1 loss was prognostic even in tumors harboring genomic deletions of the phosphatase and tensin homolog tumor suppressor (p < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis suggested that CEACAM1 analysis can provide independent prognostic information beyond established prognosis parameters at the stage of the initial biopsy when therapy decisions must be taken.

The genomic landscape of plasma DNA has been characterized in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) but the plasma methylome has not been extensively explored. Here, we performed next-generation sequencing (NGS) on plasma DNA with and without bisulfite treatment from mCRPC patients receiving either abiraterone or enzalutamide in the pre- or post-chemotherapy setting. Principal component analysis on the mCRPC plasma methylome indicated that the main contributor to methylation variance (principal component one, or PC1) was strongly correlated with genomically determined tumor fraction (r = -0.96; P < 10-8) and characterized by hypermethylation of targets of the polycomb repressor complex 2 components. Further deconvolution of the PC1 top-correlated segments revealed that these segments are comprised of methylation patterns specific to either prostate cancer or prostate normal epithelium.

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively included 419 consecutive patients with biochemical recurrence (prostate specific antigen less than 2.0 ng/ml) after radical prostatectomy who underwent 68Ga-prostate specific membrane antigen-11 positron emission tomography/computerized tomography to guide salvage therapy. Patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy between radical prostatectomy and prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computerized tomography were excluded from the study. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess predictors for the detection of prostate cancer recurrence outside the prostatic fossa on prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computerized tomography. We minimized overfitting of the model and used decision curve analysis to determine clinical utility.  Results:   Median prostate specific antigen at scanning was 0.40 ng/ml (IQR 0.30-0.70). Overall 174 (42%) patients had prostate cancer recurrence outside the prostatic fossa. Prostate specific antigen at time of scanning, and grade group, N stage and surgical margin status at radical prostatectomy specimen were significant predictors for detecting prostate cancer recurrence outside the prostatic fossa.

Despite several studies are continuously performed to identify the best curative dose of IR, the role of dose-rate, IR delivered per unit of time, on tumor control is still largely unknown.Materials and methods: Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines were irradiated with 2 or 10 Gy delivered at dose-rates of 1.5, 2.5, 5.5 and 10.1 Gy/min. Cell-survival rate and cell cycle distribution were evaluated by clonogenic assays and flow cytometry, respectively. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected by cytometry. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction assessed the expression of anti-oxidant-related factors including NRF2, SODs, CAT and GPx4 and miRNAs (miR-22, -126, -210, -375, -146a, -34a). Annexin V and caspase-8, -9 and -3 activity were assessed to characterize cell death. Senescence was determined by assessing β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity. Immunoblotting was performed to assess the expression/activation of: i) phosphorylated H2AX (γ-H2AX), markers of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs); ii) p19Kip1/Cip1, p21Waf1/Cip1 and p27Kip1/Cip1, senescence-related-markers; iii) p62, LC3-I and LC3-II, regulators of autophagy; iv) ATM, RAD51, DNA-PKcs, Ku70 and Ku80, mediators of DSBs repair.Results: Low dose-rate (LDR) more efficiently induced apoptosis and senescence in RMS while high dose-rate (HDR) necrosis in PCa. This paralleled with a lower ability of LDR-RMS and HDR-PCa irradiated cells to activate DSBs repair. Modulating the dose rate did not differently affect the anti-oxidant ability of cancer cells.Conclusion: The present results indicate that a stronger cytotoxic effect was induced by modulating the dose-rate in a cancer cell-dependent manner, this suggesting that choose the dose-rate based on the individual patient's tumor characteristics could be strategic for effective RT exposures.""","""['Francesco Petragnano', 'Ilaria Pietrantoni', 'Valentina Di Nisio', 'Irene Fasciani', 'Andrea Del Fattore', 'Carlo Capalbo', 'Sara Cheleschi', 'Paolo Tini', 'Simone Orelli', 'Silvia Codenotti', 'Maria Antonietta Mazzei', ""Giuseppe D'Ermo"", 'Gaetano Pannitteri', 'Mario Tombolini', 'Paola De Cesaris', 'Anna Riccioli', 'Antonio Filippini', 'Luisa Milazzo', 'Francesca Vulcano', 'Alessandro Fanzani', 'Roberto Maggio', 'Francesco Marampon', 'Vincenzo Tombolini']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Biol""","""['NRF2 orchestrates the redox regulation induced by radiation therapy, sustaining embryonal and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cells radioresistance.', 'Cell death in irradiated prostate epithelial cells: role of apoptotic and clonogenic cell kill.', 'Resveratrol enhances ionizing radiation-induced premature senescence in lung cancer cells.', 'Mechanisms of radiation toxicity in transformed and non-transformed cells.', 'The Roles of Autophagy and Senescence in the Tumor Cell Response to Radiation.', 'Spermine oxidase induces DNA damage and sensitizes fusion negative rhabdomyosarcoma cells to irradiation.', 'The botanical drug PBI-05204, a supercritical CO2 extract of Nerium oleander, sensitizes alveolar and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma to radiotherapy in vitro and in vivo.', 'GPCRs in Intracellular Compartments: New Targets for Drug Discovery.', 'Radioresistance in rhabdomyosarcomas: Much more than a question of dose.', 'Reparative properties of human glioblastoma cells after single exposure to a wide range of X-ray doses.']"""

We found that, in both primary tumor and metastases, PMN-MDSCs infiltrate much more readily in the stromal area compared with the epithelial area of the tumor regions. In comparison to the stromal area of primary tumors, the stromal area of either lymph node metastases or bone metastases was infiltrated with more PMN-MDSCs. In primary tumors, stromal PMN-MDSCs were associated with vascularization, segmented neutrophils, patient age and close juxtaposition to neoplastic epithelial cells.

However, existing predictive models have difficulty in estimating the mechanisms of side effects in terms of molecular targets or they do not cover the wide range of pharmacological targets. In the present study, we constructed novel in silico models to predict chemical-induced side effects and estimate the underlying mechanisms with high general versatility by integrating the comprehensive prediction of potential chemical-protein interactions (CPIs) with machine learning. First, the potential CPIs were comprehensively estimated by chemometrics based on the known CPI data (1,179,848 interactions involving 3,905 proteins and 824,143 chemicals). Second, the predictive models for 61 side effects in the cardiovascular system (CVS), gastrointestinal system (GIS), and central nervous system (CNS) were constructed by sparsity-induced classifiers based on the known and potential CPI data. The cross validation experiments showed that the proposed CPI-based models had a higher or comparable performance than the traditional chemical structure-based models. Moreover, our enrichment analysis indicated that the highly weighted proteins derived from predictive models could be involved in the corresponding functions of the side effects. For example, in CVS, the carcinogenesis-related pathways (e.g., prostate cancer, PI3K-Akt signal pathway), which were recently reported to be involved in cardiovascular side effects, were enriched. Therefore, our predictive models are biologically valid and would be useful for predicting side effects and novel potential underlying mechanisms of chemical-induced side effects.""","""['Yuto Amano', 'Hiroshi Honda', 'Ryusuke Sawada', 'Yuko Nukada', 'Masayuki Yamane', 'Naohiro Ikeda', 'Osamu Morita', 'Yoshihiro Yamanishi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Toxicol Sci""","""['Improving compound-protein interaction prediction by building up highly credible negative samples.', 'Computational models for the prediction of adverse cardiovascular drug reactions.', 'Similarity-based machine learning support vector machine predictor of drug-drug interactions with improved accuracies.', 'Engineering Aspects of Olfaction.', 'In silico assessment of adverse drug reactions and associated mechanisms.', 'RAID: Regression Analysis-Based Inductive DNA Microarray for Precise Read-Across.', 'In Silico Model for Chemical-Induced Chromosomal Damages Elucidates Mode of Action and Irrelevant Positives.']"""

This multicenter study (eight European countries) has recruited more than 180,000 asymptomatic men. After a follow-up period of 16 years, it has been shown that PSA screening reduces PCa mortality by 20%, and that it does not affect all-cause mortality. This article provides updated the results of the Spanish arm of the ERSPC after 21 years of follow-up.  Materials and methods:   The study invited 18,612 men (aged 45 - 70) of the Spanish section (Getafe and Parla, Madrid) to participate. They were randomly assigned to the intervention arm (serum PSA-based screening) and to the control arm (follow-up without intervention). The diagnoses of PCa were recorded, as well as the PCa-specific and all-cause mortality rates. A comparison between the survival curves of both arms of the study and detailed analysis of the causes of death were performed.  Results:   The study finally included 4,276 men (2,415 intervention arm, 1,861 control arm). The median age, serum PSA and follow-up time were 57 years, 0.9 ng/ml and 21.1 years, respectively. There were 285 cases with PCa diagnosis, 188 (7.8%) from the intervention arm and 97 (5.2%) from the control arm (p<,001). A total of 216 (75.8%) presented organ-confined disease. There were 994 deaths were recorded; 544 (22.5%) in the intervention arm and 450 (24.2%) in the control arm. No significant differences were detected between the arms of the study in terms of cancer-specific (p=.768) or all-cause (p=.192) mortality rates. The main cause of death was malignant tumors (492 patients, 49.5% of overall mortality), and the most frequent sites were lung and bronchus (29.5%), colon and rectum (14.8%), and hematologic (9.8%). Only 20 patients (0.4% of the patients recruited) died from PCa, with no significant difference between study arms.

Respondents were asked about 23 health information needs in eight domains (tests and treatment, side effects and symptoms, health promotion, fertility, interpersonal, occupational, emotional, and insurance). Poisson regression models were used to assess relationships between number of health information needs and demographic and cancer characteristics.  Results:   Participants (n = 170) reported an average of four health information needs, with the most common domains being: side effects and symptoms (58 %), health promotion (54 %), and tests and treatment (41 %). Participants who were younger (compared to 5-year increase, rate ratio [RR] = 1.11, 95 % CI = 1.02-1.21), ethnic minority (RR = 1.89, 95 % CI = 1.17-3.06), less educated (RR = 1.49, 95 % CI = 1.00-2.23), and financially stressed (RR = 1.87, 95 % CI = 1.25-2.81) had a greater number of information needs.  Conclusions:   Younger, ethnic minority, less educated, and financially strained rural survivors have the greatest need for informational support.

However, the mechanism by which these kinases drive tumor growth has not been completely elucidated. To determine the genes controlled by these protein kinases, we carried out a microarray analysis in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) comparing early progenitor (ETP-ALL) cell lines whose growth is driven by PIM kinases to more mature T-ALL cells that have low PIM levels. This analysis demonstrated that the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) H19 was associated with increased PIM levels in ETP-ALL. Overexpression or knockdown of PIM in these T-ALL cell lines controlled the level of H19 and regulated the methylation of the H19 promoter, suggesting a mechanism by which PIM controls H19 transcription. In these T-ALL cells, the expression of PIM1 induced stem cell gene expression (SOX2, OCT-4, and NANOG) through H19. Identical results were found in prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines where PIM kinases drive cancer growth, and both H19 and stem cell gene levels. Small molecule pan-PIM inhibitors (PIM-i) currently in clinical trials reduced H19 expression in both of these tumor types. Importantly, the knockdown of H19 blocked the ability of PIM to induce stem cell genes in T-ALL cells, suggesting a novel signal transduction cascade. In PCa, increases in SOX2 levels have been shown to cause both resistance to the androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and the induction of neuroendocrine PCa, a highly metastatic form of this disease. Treatment of PCa cells with a small molecule pan-PIM-i reduced stem cell gene transcription and enhanced ADT, while overexpression of H19 suppressed the ability of pan-PIM-i to regulate hormone blockade. Together, these results demonstrate that the PIM kinases control the level of lncRNA H19, which in turn modifies stem cell gene transcription regulating tumor growth.""","""['Neha Singh', 'Sathish K R Padi', 'Jeremiah J Bearss', 'Ritu Pandey', 'Koichi Okumura', 'Himisha Beltran', 'Jin H Song', 'Andrew S Kraft', 'Virginie Olive']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Oncol""","""['The long noncoding RNA H19 regulates tumor plasticity in neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Targeting the PIM protein kinases for the treatment of a T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia subset.', 'PIM Kinase Inhibitors Block the Growth of Primary T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: Resistance Pathways Identified by Network Modeling Analysis.', 'Mechanism-based combinations with Pim kinase inhibitors in cancer treatments.', 'PIM serine/threonine kinases in the pathogenesis and therapy of hematologic malignancies and solid cancers.', 'Long Non-Coding RNAs, Cell Cycle, and Human Breast Cancer.', 'Targeting Pim kinases in hematological cancers: molecular and clinical review.', 'Long Non-Coding RNA and microRNA Interplay in Colorectal Cancer and Their Effect on the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'The Role of PIM Kinases in Pediatric Solid Tumors.', 'Emerging Roles of Long Noncoding RNAs in Breast Cancer Epigenetics and Epitranscriptomics.']"""

We have previously reported an anti-prostate cancer effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist exendin-4. The attenuation of cell proliferation in the prostate cancer cell line was dependent on GLP-1R expression. Here, we examined the relationship between human prostate cancer severity and GLP-1R expression, as well as the effect of forced expression of GLP-1R using a lentiviral vector.  Materials and methods:   Prostate cancer tissues were extracted by prostatectomy and biopsy. GLP-1R was overexpressed in ALVA-41 cells using a lentiviral vector (ALVA-41-GLP-1R cells). GLP-1R expression was detected by immunohistochemistry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Cell proliferation was examined by growth curves and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assays. Cell cycle distribution and regulators were examined by flow cytometry and western blotting. In vivo experiments were carried out using a xenografted model.  Results:   GLP-1R expression levels were significantly inversely associated with the Gleason score of human prostate cancer tissues. Abundant GLP-1R expression and functions were confirmed in ALVA-41-GLP-1R cells. Exendin-4 significantly decreased ALVA-41-GLP-1R cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. DNA synthesis and G1-to-S phase transition were inhibited in ALVA-41-GLP-1R cells. SKP2 expression was decreased and p27Kip1 protein was subsequently increased in ALVA-41-GLP-1R cells treated with exendin-4. In vivo experiments carried out by implanting ALVA-41-GLP-1R cells showed that exendin-4 decreased prostate cancer growth by activation of GLP-1R overexpressed in ALVA41-GLP-1R cells.

Transduction of human hematopoietic stem cells with GALV retroviral vectors is more efficient than with amphotropic vectors. In this study, a Moloney murine leukemia virus-gibbon ape leukemia virus (MoMLV-GALV) vector was constructed by replacing the natural env gene of the full-length Moloney MLV genome with the GALV env gene. To monitor viral transmission by green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression, internal ribosomal entry site-enhanced GFP (IRES-EGFP) was positioned between the GALV env gene and the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) to obtain pMoMLV-GALV-EGFP. The MoMLV-GALV-EGFP vector was able to replicate with high titer in TE671 human rhabdomyosarcoma cells and U-87 human glioma cells. To evaluate the potential of the MoMLV-GALV vector as a therapeutic agent, the gene for the fusogenic envelope G glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) was incorporated into the vector. Infection with the resulting MoMLV-GALV-VSV-G vector resulted in lysis of the U-87 cells due to syncytium formation. Syncytium formation was also observed in the transfected human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP after extended cultivation of cells. In addition, we deleted the GALV env gene from the MoMLV-GALV-VSV-G vector to improve viral genome stability. This MoMLV-VSV-G vector is also replication competent and induces syncytium formation in 293T, HT1080, TE671 and U-87 cells. These results suggest that replication of the MoMLV-GALV-VSV-G vector or MoMLV-VSV-G vector may directly lead to cytotoxicity.

Two-way ANOVA was used to identify significant differences among age groups and regions within the prostate. Age-related and area-related changes in these parameters were assessed using Spearman's correlation coefficients.  Results:   There were differences in the parameters among regions of the prostate (P < 0.05).

A recent meta-analysis indicated that response expectancies, measured using different assessment formats, reveal different effect sizes, potentially explaining mixed outcomes. Utilizing a clinical sample, we compared 5-point assessments and visual analogue scales, as measures of response expectancies for the incidence and severity of subsequent toxicities.  Methods:   Four weeks pre-radiotherapy, 45 men with prostate cancer rated their response expectancies of the same 18 toxicities on 5-point assessments and visual analogue scales, presented in random order. Descriptors anchored each end of visual analogue scales and every point of 5-point assessments was labelled, including an 'unsure' midpoint. Toxicities were subsequently assessed 2-weeks into radiotherapy on 100-point visual analogue scales.  Results:   Across all toxicities, 17.5-62.8% of patients selected 'unsure' on 5-point assessments. No response expectancies were reported on 5-point assessments for 'blood in stools' or 'rectal urgency' yet 54.8%-64.3% of patients indicated response expectancies for these toxicities on visual analogue scales. Visual analogue scales and 5-point scales demonstrated small-to-moderate associations (r = 0.30-0.58) as measures of response expectancy incidence, but mostly large associations when visual analogue scales captured severity (r = 0.43-0.76). Response expectancies measured with visual analogue scales predicted more toxicities to a moderate degree or greater (68.8%) than 5-point assessments (37.5%).

Materials and methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry (2001-2016), we identified patients with non-metastatic (T1-4, N0, M0) SCCUB.

Results:   Of 595 patients with SCCUB, 230 (38.5%), 159 (27%), and 206 (34.5%) were treated with chemotherapy alone, chemotherapy + RC, and chemotherapy + RT, respectively. The rates of chemotherapy + RC increased (estimated annual percentage changes [EAPC], +5.9%; P = .002). Conversely, chemotherapy alone (EAPC, -1.7%; P = .1) and chemotherapy + RT rates decreased (EAPC: -2.2%; P = .08). Overall, 5-year cancer-specific mortality (CSM) rates were 44%, 29%, and 40% for patients treated with chemotherapy alone, chemotherapy + RC, and chemotherapy + RT, respectively (P = .004). Relative to chemotherapy alone, patients treated with chemotherapy + RC experienced lower CSM (hazard ratio, 0.5; P < .001). Conversely, patients treated with chemotherapy + RT did not exhibit any CSM benefit (hazard ratio, 0.8; P = .2), when compared with chemotherapy alone.  Conclusion:   In contemporary patients with SCCUB with non-metastatic disease, the rates of chemotherapy + RC are increasing.

Whether and how neddylation modification regulates AR, and the therapeutic implications of this potential regulation, are relatively unexplored areas of investigation. Here we report that neddylation inactivation by the pharmacological inhibitor MLN4924 or Lenti-shRNA-based genetic knockdown of neddylation activating enzyme (NAE) selectively suppressed growth and survival of prostate cancer cells with minor, if any, effect on normal prostate epithelial cells. MLN4924 also significantly suppressed the invasive capacity of prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, compared to monotherapy, the combination of MLN4924 with AR antagonist or castration significantly enhanced growth suppression of prostate cancer cells in vitro, and tumor growth in an in vivo xenograft model. Mechanistically, MLN4924 repressed the transcription of AR/AR-V7 and its downstream targets, and blocked MMP2 and MMP9 expression. Taken together, our study reveals that the neddylation pathway positively regulates AR/AR-V7 transcription, and that the neddylation inhibitor MLN4924 has therapeutic potential for the treatment of aggressive prostate cancers.""","""['Xiaochen Zhou', 'Sumin Han', 'Kari Wilder-Romans', 'Grace Y Sun', 'Hong Zhu', 'Xiaoqiang Liu', 'Mingjia Tan', 'Gongxian Wang', 'Felix Y Feng', 'Yi Sun']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['MLN4924 (Pevonedistat), a protein neddylation inhibitor, suppresses proliferation and migration of human clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'Neddylation inhibitor MLN4924 suppresses growth and migration of human gastric cancer cells.', 'Targeting protein neddylation with an NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor MLN4924 induced apoptosis or senescence in human lymphoma cells.', 'Neddylation-Independent Activities of MLN4924.', 'Androgen receptor splicing variant 7: Beyond being a constitutively active variant.', 'Targeting androgen receptor and the variants by an orally bioavailable Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras compound in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'PD-L1 induction via the MEK-JNK-AP1 axis by a neddylation inhibitor promotes cancer-associated immunosuppression.', 'Mechanical stress shapes the cancer cell response to neddylation inhibition.', 'Prognostic and therapeutic significance of COP9 signalosome subunit CSN5 in prostate cancer.', 'Inhibiting Neddylation with MLN4924 Suppresses Growth and Delays Multicellular Development in Dictyostelium discoideum.']"""

To enhance tumour recognition by T-cells, chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) consisting of signalling domains fused to receptors that recognize tumour-associated antigens can be expressed in T-cells. While CAR T-cells have shown clinical success for treating haematopoietic malignancies, using CAR T-cells to treat solid tumours remains a challenge. We developed a chimeric PD1 (chPD1) receptor that recognizes the ligands for the PD1 receptor that are expressed on many types of solid cancer. To determine if this novel CAR could target a wide variety of tumour types, the anti-tumour efficacy of chPD1 T-cells against syngeneic murine models of melanoma, renal, pancreatic, liver, colon, breast, prostate and bladder cancer was measured. Of the 14 cell lines tested, all expressed PD1 ligands on their cell surface, making them potential targets for chPD1 T-cells. ChPD1 T-cells lysed the tumour cells and secreted pro-inflammatory cytokines [interferon (IFN)γ, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)α, interleukin (IL)-2, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-17 and IL-21], but did not secrete the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Furthermore, T-cells expressing chPD1 receptors reduced an established tumour burden and led to long-term tumour-free survival in all types of solid tumours tested. ChPD1 T-cells did not survive longer than 14 days in vivo; however, treatment with chPD1 T-cells induced protective host anti-tumour memory responses in tumour-bearing mice. Therefore, adoptive transfer of chPD1 T-cells could be a novel therapeutic strategy to treat multiple types of solid cancer.""","""['Geoffrey Parriott', 'Kelsey Deal', 'Shane Crean', 'Elle Richardson', 'Emily Nylen', 'Amorette Barber']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Immunology""","""['Adoptive transfer of murine T cells expressing a chimeric-PD1-Dap10 receptor as an immunotherapy for lymphoma.', 'Inclusion of Dap10 or 4-1BB costimulation domains in the chPD1 receptor enhances anti-tumor efficacy of T cells in murine models of lymphoma and melanoma.', 'Mechanisms of Acute Toxicity in NKG2D Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cell-Treated Mice.', 'Research Techniques Made Simple: CAR T-Cell Therapy.', 'Chimeric antigen receptor-engineered T-cell therapy for liver cancer.', 'Advances in CAR T-cell therapy in bile duct, pancreatic, and gastric cancers.', ""Tumor buster - where will the CAR-T cell therapy 'missile' go?"", 'The landscape of chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy in breast cancer: Perspectives and outlook.', 'CAR-T Cells in the Treatment of Urologic Neoplasms: Present and Future.', 'Combination therapy for pancreatic cancer: anti-PD-(L)1-based strategy.']"""

Using our original in vitro coculture system, we previously reported that leucinostatin (LCS)-A, a peptide mycotoxin, inhibited prostate cancer DU-145 cell growth through reduction of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I) expression in PrSCs. To further obtain additional bioactive compounds from LCS-A, we designed and synthesized a series of LCS-A derivatives as compounds that target PrSCs. Among the synthesized LCS-A derivatives, LCS-7 reduced IGF-I expression in PrSCs with lower toxicity to PrSCs and mice than LCS-A. As LCS-A has been suggested to interact with mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase, a docking study was performed to elucidate the mechanism of reduced IGF-I expression in the PrSCs. As expected, LCS-A and LCS-7 directly interacted with mitochondrial ATP synthase, and like LCS-A and LCS-7, other mitochondrial ATP synthase inhibitors also reduced the expression of IGF-I by PrSCs. Furthermore, LCS-A and LCS-7 significantly decreased the growth of mouse xenograft tumors.

Additional population-representative human studies are needed and large population-based linkage cohorts have been explored as an option for surveillance shift work and cancer risk. This study uses a surveillance linkage cohort and job-exposure matrix to test relationships.  Methods:   We estimated associations between shift work and breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer using the population-based Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort (CanCHEC), linking the 1991 Canadian census to national cancer registry and mortality databases. Prevalence estimates from population labour survey data were used to estimate and assign probability of night, rotating, or evening shifts by occupation and industry. Cohort members were assigned to high (>50%), medium (>25 to 50%), low (>5 to 25%), or no (<5%) probability of exposure categories. Cox proportional hazards modelling was used to estimate associations between shift work exposure and incidence of prostate cancer in men and ovarian and breast cancer in women.  Results:   The cohort included 1 098 935 men and 939 520 women. Hazard ratios (HRs) indicated null or inverse relationships comparing high probability to no exposure for prostate cancer: HR = 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.91-1.02; breast cancer: HR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.90-0.99; and ovarian cancer: HR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.87-1.13.  Conclusions:   This study showed inverse and null associations between shift work exposure and incidence of prostate, breast, or ovarian cancer.

The effect of PIRADSv2 MTS on image quality has not been validated. We aimed to determine whether adherence to PI-RADSv2 MTS improves study adequacy and perceived quality.  Materials and methods:   Sixty-two prostate MRI examinations including T2 weighted (T2W) and diffusion weighted image (DWI) consecutively referred to our center from 62 different institutions within a 12-month period (September 2017 to September 2018) were included. Six readers assessed images as adequate or inadequate for use in PCa detection and a numerical image quality ranking was given using a 1-5 scale. The PI-RADSv2 MTS were synthesized into sets of seven and 10 rules for T2W and DWI, respectively. Image adherence was assessed using Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) metadata. Statistical analysis of survey results and image adherence was performed based on reader quality scoring (Kendall Rank tau-b) and reader adequate scoring (Wilcoxon test for association) for T2 and DWI quality assessment.  Results:   Out of 62 images, 52 (83%) T2W and 38 (61%) DWIs were rated to be adequate by a majority of readers. Reader adequacy scores showed no significant association with adherence to PI-RADSv2. There was a weak (tau-b = 0.22) but significant (p value = 0.01) correlation between adherence to PIRADSv2 MTS and image quality for T2W.

There was no difference in gastrointestinal toxicity (conventionally fractionated radiotherapy: 5.0 events/100 person-years; hypofractionated radiotherapy: 5.2 events/100 person-years; adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio: 1.00, 95% confidence interval: 0.89-1.13; P = 0.95) or genitourinary toxicity (conventionally fractionated radiotherapy: 2.3 events/100 person-years; hypofractionated radiotherapy: 2.3 events/100 person-years; adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio: 0.92, 95% confidence interval: 0.77-1.10; P = 0.35) between patients who received conventionally fractionated radiotherapy and those who received hypofractionated radiotherapy.  Conclusions:   This national cohort study has shown that the use of hypofractionated radiotherapy in the radical treatment of PCa does not increase rates of severe gastrointestinal or genitourinary toxicity. Our findings also support the use of hypofractionated radiotherapy in older men and those with locally advanced PCa.""","""['A Sujenthiran', 'M Parry', 'J Nossiter', 'B Berry', 'P J Cathcart', 'N W Clarke', 'H Payne', 'J van der Meulen', 'A Aggarwal']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol)""","""['Intensity-modulated fractionated radiotherapy versus stereotactic body radiotherapy for prostate cancer (PACE-B): acute toxicity findings from an international, randomised, open-label, phase 3, non-inferiority trial.', 'Hypofractionated versus conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for patients with prostate cancer (HYPRO): acute toxicity results from a randomised non-inferiority phase 3 trial.', 'Ultra-hypofractionated versus conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: 5-year outcomes of the HYPO-RT-PC randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial.', 'Toxicity after moderately hypofractionated versus conventionally fractionated prostate radiotherapy: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the current literature.', 'External beam radiation dose escalation for high grade glioma.']"""

Methods:   Therefore, a tissue microarray containing 17,747 prostate cancer specimens with associated pathological, clinical, and molecular data was analyzed by immunohistochemistry to assess the role of TFAP2D.  Results:   TFAP2D expression was typically increased in prostate cancer as compared to adjacent non-neoplastic glands. TFAP2D staining was considered negative in 24.3% and positive in 75.7% of 13,545 interpretable cancers. TFAP2D staining was significantly linked to advanced tumor stage, high classical and quantitative Gleason grade, lymph node metastasis, and a positive surgical margin (p ≤ 0.0045). TFAP2D positivity was more common in ERG fusion positive (88.7%) than in ERG negative cancers (66.8%; p < 0.0001). Subset analyses in 3776 cancers with and 4722 cancers without TMPRSS2:ERG fusion revealed that associations with tumor phenotype and patient outcome were largely driven by the subset of ERG negative tumors. Multivariate analysis did not identify TFAP2D protein expression levels as a robust independent prognostic parameter. Positive TFAP2D immunostaining was significantly associated with 10 of 11 previously analyzed chromosomal deletions in ERG negative cancers (p ≤ 0.0244 each) indicating that elevated TFAP2D expression parallels genomic instability in prostate cancer.

Technical and logistical issues, however, make it challenging to accurately detect abnormal copy number events in a cost-effective manner in clinical studies.  Results:   Here we present CNV Radar, a software tool that utilizes next-generation sequencing read depth information and variant allele frequency patterns, to infer the true copy number status of genes and genomic regions from whole exome sequencing data. Evaluation of CNV Radar in a public multiple myeloma dataset demonstrated that CNV Radar was able to detect a variety of CNVs associated with risk of progression, and we observed > 70% concordance with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results. Compared to other CNV callers, CNV Radar showed high sensitivity and specificity. Similar results were observed when comparing CNV Radar calls to single nucleotide polymorphism array results from acute myeloid leukemia and prostate cancer datasets available on TCGA. More importantly, CNV Radar demonstrated its utility in the clinical trial setting: in POLLUX and CASTOR, two phase 3 studies in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, we observed a high concordance rate with FISH for del17p, a risk defining CNV event (88% in POLLUX and 90% in CASTOR), therefore allowing for efficacy assessments in clinically relevant disease subgroups. Our case studies also showed that CNV Radar is capable of detecting abnormalities such as copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity that elude other approaches.  Conclusions:   We demonstrated that CNV Radar is more sensitive than other CNV detection methods, accurately detects clinically important cytogenetic events, and allows for further interrogation of novel disease biology.

The interaction between hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) secreted by the stroma, with its receptor c-Met located in the epithelium, must occur for epithelial CaP cells to become migratory. We studied the effects of grape-derived phytochemical resveratrol on the transition of epithelial tumor cells from sedentary to a mobile, penetrant phenotype.

Tc-99m PSMA single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT) was performed at the baseline (SPECT/CT1) and after 3-6 months of treatment (SPECT/CT2). The treatment response was determined by visual analysis based on molecular imaging PSMA (miPSMA) scores framework and was compared with conventional biochemical analysis. We chose either the hottest lesion (target A) or five of the hottest lesions (target B) to calculate the tumor/background ratio (TBR) and the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and compared their performances in predicting progression-free survival (PFS). Changes in PSMA expression between SPECT/CT1 and SPECT/CT2 were well associated with the results of the visual analysis. The TBR and the SUVmax of both targets were significantly associated with the baseline serum PSA level (P < .0001). The biochemical and radiological responses were concordant in 56 of the 68 patients (P < .001). The median PFS of the nonresponse group patients was significantly shorter than that of the patients in the response group (6.8 vs 12.1 months, P = .012). For predicting PFS, most of the indexes tested were significant on SPECT/CT2, with %ΔTBR being the most significant prognostic factor.

Recent findings pointed to an age dependence of PCA3, with putative impact on test interpretation. However, to date no experience has been reported with regard to the extent age might modify the score in certain age ranges. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to re-evaluate the age dependency and, moreover, give suggestions for interpretation of the PCA3 score in dependence of patient's age in daily routine.  Methods:   The study comprised 684 patients before prostate biopsy or prostatectomy. Post-massage voided urine samples were assessed by PCA3 measurement. PCA3 scores were correlated to patient's age. The collective was divided into four subcollectives by quartiles of age distribution. For every subcollective the cutoff value at specificity of ≥ 60 was determined. Results were classified by age-class specific cutoff values and test qualities were compared at different cutoffs.  Results:   In the collective, 59.1% of patients had a positive biopsy. PCA3 correlated to patient's age in univariate and multivariate analysis (p < 0.001 each). The division into age subcollectives revealed groups < 60, 60 - 65, 66 - 69 and > 69 years. Median PCA3 values of patients without/with PC were 17/32, 27/42, 34/55 and 52/68 in the four age classes. Cutoff values for which specificity was determined with ≥ 60 were 23, 39, 42, and 65. Constant cutoff values showed lower sensitivities in younger and lower specificities in older patients. Only the age adjusted values revealed an improved performance with PPV 68.7, accuracy 59.5 and sensitivity 57.7 at specificity of 62.1% in the whole cohort.  Conclusions:   The study confirms that the PCA3 score increases with age. The recommended cutoff score of 35 is suitable especially for patients aged in their sixties. Lower reference values between 20 and 30 have to be taken into account in patients aged < 60 years and higher values around 40 to 50 may point to suspicion for PC in patients > 69 years. These results may further improve the diagnostic performance of the PCA3 test and keep the PCA3 test as a significant test in PC diagnostics along with new upcoming urine markers.""","""['Jörg Hennenlotter', 'Tim Neumann', 'Simon Alperowitz', 'Viktoria Wagner', 'Andrea Hohneder', 'Jens Bedke', 'Arnulf Stenzl', 'Tilman Todenhöfer', 'Steffen Rausch']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Lab""","""['Clinical utility of the prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) urine assay in Japanese men undergoing prostate biopsy.', 'Urine TMPRSS2:ERG Plus PCA3 for Individualized Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment.', 'Prostate cancer gene 3 urine assay cutoff in diagnosis of prostate cancer: a validation study on an Italian patient population undergoing first and repeat biopsy.', 'Comparison of diagnostic efficacy by two urine PCA3 scores in prostate cancer patients undergoing repeat biopsies.', 'The PCA3 test for guiding repeat biopsy of prostate cancer and its cut-off score: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Molecular Biomarkers for the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'A Model to Detect Significant Prostate Cancer Integrating Urinary Peptide and Extracellular Vesicle RNA Data.']"""

Necroptosis, as well as apoptosis, has been considered as another form of regulated cell death which can be used as an effective way to overcome apoptosis-resistant tumor tissue growth. The aim of present study was to test whether or not ripk1, ripk3, or mlkl expression levels, as the key necroptotic modulators in different stages of prostate tumor growth.  Methods:   Sixty-seven prostate tissues representing histologically confirmed cancer were selected. The cancer samples were categorized into 4 different stages based on cellular differentiation, tumor growth rate, and extra tissue expansion to regional lymph nodes, average PSA levels, and tumor volume. RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and quantitative real time PCR were done based on standard guidelines.  Results:   No statistically significant changes in ripk1 expression showed in all three stages (stage II to IV). The expression pattern of ripk3 represented a remarkable elevation in early stage, while, predominantly repressed in final cancer stage (IV). Also, there has been a significant negative correlation between ripk3 gene expression and tumor size and PSA levels.  Conclusions:   We cannot exclude the importance of the key regulator proteins in development and progression of prevalent lethal disease like prostate cancer. The ripk1/ripk3 mediated necroptosis pathway is more activated in early stages of prostate cancer via induced ripk3 expression, while repressed during prostate cancer final stages. Also, the repression of ripk3 is related to elevation of both PSA levels and tumor volume which represented the tumor progression in final stages.""","""['Farnaz Heidaryan', 'Hadi Bamehr', 'Babak Babaabasi', 'Alireza Emamvirdizadeh', 'Nima Mohammadzadeh', 'Ahmad Khalili']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Lab""","""['The neurotoxicant PCB-95 by increasing the neuronal transcriptional repressor REST down-regulates caspase-8 and increases Ripk1, Ripk3 and MLKL expression determining necroptotic neuronal death.', 'Opposite Effects of Apoptotic and Necroptotic Cellular Pathways on Rotavirus Replication.', 'FKBP12 mediates necroptosis by initiating RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL signal transduction in response to TNF receptor 1 ligation.', 'Surviving death: emerging concepts of RIPK3 and MLKL ubiquitination in the regulation of necroptosis.', 'Necroptosis: a crucial pathogenic mediator of human disease.', 'From (Tool)Bench to Bedside: The Potential of Necroptosis Inhibitors.', 'The Therapeutic Potential of Pyroptosis in Melanoma.', 'Necroptosis and Prostate Cancer: Molecular Mechanisms and Therapeutic Potential.', 'Regulated Cell Death in Urinary Malignancies.']"""

Here, we profiled the proteome and transcriptome of the Pten-KO mouse prostate tumors for global macromolecular expression alterations for signaling changes and biomarker signatures.  Methods:   For proteomics, four pairs of whole prostates from tissue-specific conditional knockout Pten-KO mice (12-15 weeks of age) and their respective wild-type littermates housed in the same cages were analyzed by 8-plex isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation iTRAQ. For microarray transcriptomic analysis, three additional matched pairs of prostate/tumor specimens from respective mice at 20 to 22 weeks of age were used. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to verify the trends of protein and RNA expression changes. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis were carried out for bioinformatic characterizations of pathways and networks.  Results:   At the macromolecular level, proteomic and transcriptomic analyses complement and cross-validate to reveal overexpression signatures including inflammation and immune alterations, in particular, neutrophil/myeloid lineage suppressor cell features, chromatin/histones, ion and nutrient transporters, and select glutathione peroxidases and transferases in Pten-KO prostate tumors. Suppressed expression patterns in the Pten-KO prostate tumors included glandular differentiation such as secretory proteins and androgen receptor targets, smooth muscle features, and endoplasmic reticulum stress proteins. Bioinformatic analyses identified immune and inflammation responses as the most profound macromolecular landscape changes, and the predicted key nodal activities through Akt, nuclear factor-kappaB, and P53 in the Pten-KO prostate tumor. Comparison with other genetically modified mouse prostate carcinogenesis models revealed notable molecular distinctions, especially the dominance of immune and inflammation features in the Pten-KO prostate tumors.

However, our knowledge of the genomic and transcriptomic alterations of KAT genes and their clinical significance in human cancer remains incomplete. We undertook a metagenomic analysis of 37 KATs in more than 10 000 cancer samples across 33 tumor types, focusing on breast cancer. We identified associations among recurrent genetic alteration, gene expression, clinicopathologic features, and patient survival. Loss-of-function analysis was carried out to examine which KAT has important roles in growth and viability of breast cancer cells. We identified that a subset of KAT genes, including NAA10, KAT6A, and CREBBP, have high frequencies of genomic amplification or mutation in a spectrum of human cancers.

Methods:   Data on new cancer diagnoses during 2001 through 2016 were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-funded and National Cancer Institute-funded population-based cancer registry programs and compiled by the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Data on cancer deaths during 2001 through 2017 were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics' National Vital Statistics System. Trends in incidence and death rates for all cancers combined and for the leading cancer types by sex, racial/ethnic group, and age were estimated by joinpoint analysis and characterized by the average annual percent change during the most recent 5 years (2012-2016 for incidence and 2013-2017 for mortality).  Results:   Overall, cancer incidence rates decreased 0.6% on average per year during 2012 through 2016, but trends differed by sex, racial/ethnic group, and cancer type. Among males, cancer incidence rates were stable overall and among non-Hispanic white males but decreased in other racial/ethnic groups; rates increased for 5 of the 17 most common cancers, were stable for 7 cancers (including prostate), and decreased for 5 cancers (including lung and bronchus [lung] and colorectal). Among females, cancer incidence rates increased during 2012 to 2016 in all racial/ethnic groups, increasing on average 0.2% per year; rates increased for 8 of the 18 most common cancers (including breast), were stable for 6 cancers (including colorectal), and decreased for 4 cancers (including lung). Overall, cancer death rates decreased 1.5% on average per year during 2013 to 2017, decreasing 1.8% per year among males and 1.4% per year among females. During 2013 to 2017, cancer death rates decreased for all cancers combined among both males and females in each racial/ethnic group, for 11 of the 19 most common cancers among males (including lung and colorectal), and for 14 of the 20 most common cancers among females (including lung, colorectal, and breast). The largest declines in death rates were observed for melanoma of the skin (decreasing 6.1% per year among males and 6.3% among females) and lung (decreasing 4.8% per year among males and 3.7% among females). Among children younger than 15 years, cancer incidence rates increased an average of 0.8% per year during 2012 to 2016, and cancer death rates decreased an average of 1.4% per year during 2013 to 2017. Among adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 39 years, cancer incidence rates increased an average of 0.9% per year during 2012 to 2016, and cancer death rates decreased an average of 1.0% per year during 2013 to 2017.  Conclusions:   Although overall cancer death rates continue to decline, incidence rates are leveling off among males and are increasing slightly among females. These trends reflect population changes in cancer risk factors, screening test use, diagnostic practices, and treatment advances. Many cancers can be prevented or treated effectively if they are found early. Population-based cancer incidence and mortality data can be used to inform efforts to decrease the cancer burden in the United States and regularly monitor progress toward goals.""","""['S Jane Henley', 'Elizabeth M Ward', 'Susan Scott', 'Jiemin Ma', 'Robert N Anderson', 'Albert U Firth', 'Cheryll C Thomas', 'Farhad Islami', 'Hannah K Weir', 'Denise Riedel Lewis', 'Recinda L Sherman', 'Manxia Wu', 'Vicki B Benard', 'Lisa C Richardson', 'Ahmedin Jemal', 'Kathleen Cronin', 'Betsy A Kohler']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, part 1: National cancer statistics.', 'Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer, part I: National cancer statistics.', 'Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer, Part 1: National Cancer Statistics.', 'Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, 1975-2000, featuring the uses of surveillance data for cancer prevention and control.', 'Cancers with increasing incidence trends in the United States: 1999 through 2008.', 'Development and validation of a novel prognostic signature based on m6A/m5C/m1A-related genes in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Bubble-Based Drug Delivery Systems: Next-Generation Diagnosis to Therapy.', 'Nomogram based on quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, apparent diffusion coefficient, and clinicopathological features for early prediction of pathologic complete response in breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.', 'Diagnostic Potential of Endometrial Cancer DNA from Pipelle, Pap-Brush, and Swab Sampling.', 'The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and lactate dehydrogenase combined in predicting liver metastasis and prognosis of colorectal cancer.']"""

Part I of this report focuses on national cancer statistics, and part 2 characterizes progress in achieving select Healthy People 2020 cancer objectives.  Methods:   For this report, the authors selected objectives-including death rates, cancer screening, and major risk factors-related to 4 common cancers (lung, colorectal, female breast, and prostate). Baseline values, recent values, and the percentage change from baseline to recent values were examined overall and by select sociodemographic characteristics. Data from national surveillance systems were obtained from the Healthy People 2020 website.  Results:   Targets for death rates were met overall and in most sociodemographic groups, but not among males, blacks, or individuals in rural areas, although these groups did experience larger decreases in rates compared with other groups. During 2007 through 2017, cancer death rates decreased 15% overall, ranging from -4% (rural) to -22% (metropolitan). Targets for breast and colorectal cancer screening were not yet met overall or in any sociodemographic groups except those with the highest educational attainment, whereas lung cancer screening was generally low (<10%). Targets were not yet met overall for cigarette smoking, recent smoking cessation, excessive alcohol use, or obesity but were met for secondhand smoke exposure and physical activity. Some sociodemographic groups did not meet targets or had less improvement than others toward reaching objectives.  Conclusions:   Monitoring trends in cancer risk factors, screening test use, and mortality can help assess the progress made toward decreasing the cancer burden in the United States. Although many interventions to reduce cancer risk factors and promote healthy behaviors are proven to work, they may not be equitably applied or work well in every community. Implementing cancer prevention and control interventions that are sustainable, focused, and culturally appropriate may boost success in communities with the greatest need, ensuring that all Americans can access a path to long, healthy, cancer-free lives.""","""['S Jane Henley', 'Cheryll C Thomas', 'Denise Riedel Lewis', 'Elizabeth M Ward', 'Farhad Islami', 'Manxia Wu', 'Hannah K Weir', 'Susan Scott', 'Recinda L Sherman', 'Jiemin Ma', 'Betsy A Kohler', 'Kathleen Cronin', 'Ahmedin Jemal', 'Vicki B Benard', 'Lisa C Richardson']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, part 1: National cancer statistics.', 'Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, 1975-2000, featuring the uses of surveillance data for cancer prevention and control.', 'Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, part I: National cancer statistics.', 'Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, 1975-2002, featuring population-based trends in cancer treatment.', 'Epidemiology of cancer in the United States.', 'Age-related change in mammographic breast density of women without history of breast cancer over a 10-year retrospective study.', 'Structural Characterization, Antioxidant and Antitumor Activities of the Two Novel Exopolysaccharides Produced by Debaryomyces hansenii DH-1.', 'Anticancer Effects of Fucoxanthin through Cell Cycle Arrest, Apoptosis Induction, Angiogenesis Inhibition, and Autophagy Modulation.', 'Trends in breast cancer mortality by race/ethnicity, age, and US census region, United States─1999-2020.', 'Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, part 1: National cancer statistics.']"""

Methods:   1076 PCa patients after RP with at least one deceased first-degree relative with PCa were included and stratified by FFH (four subgroups: fraternal, paternal, multiple, and none) and by mode of inheritance (two subgroups: male to male, non-male to male). We compared clinicopathological characteristics between subgroups with Fisher's exact or Chi-square tests. Biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were analyzed using the method of Kaplan and Meier. Simple and multiple Cox regression with backward elimination were performed to select prognostic factors for BRFS and CSS.  Results:   Median age at surgery was 63.3 (range 35.9-79.4) years. The overall Kaplan-Meier estimated BRFS rate at 10 and 15 years was 65.6% and 57.0%, respectively. The overall Kaplan-Meier estimated CSS rate at 10 and 15 years was 98.1% and 95.7%, respectively. Neither FFH nor mode of inheritance were factors associated with worse BRFS. However, in multiple Cox regression, paternal FFH was an important prognostic factor for a better CSS (HR 0.19, CI 0.05-0.71, p = 0.014) compared to non-FFH.  Conclusion:   FFH and mode of inheritance do not seem to be prognostic factors of worse long-term outcomes following RP. Rather, a paternal FFH was associated with a better CSS; however, the reasons remain unclear. Nevertheless, patients after RP and FFH could be reassured that their own PCa diagnosis is not associated with a worse long-term outcome.""","""['Valentin H Meissner', 'Jamila G H Strüh', 'Martina Kron', 'Lea A Liesenfeld', 'Stephanie Kranz', 'Jürgen E Gschwend', 'Kathleen Herkommer']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Men with family history of prostate cancer have a higher risk of disease recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Radical prostatectomy represents an effective treatment in patients with specimen-confined high pathological Gleason score prostate cancer.', 'Radical prostatectomy improves progression-free and cancer-specific survival in men with lymph node positive prostate cancer in the prostate-specific antigen era: a confirmatory study.', 'Long-term cancer control outcomes of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer treatment: a meta-analysis.', 'Association between Allogeneic or Autologous Blood Transfusion and Survival in Patients after Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Long-term and pathological outcomes of low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy: implications for active surveillance.', 'No detrimental effect of a positive family history on postoperative upgrading and upstaging in men with low risk and favourable intermediate-risk prostate cancer: implications for active surveillance.']"""

The purpose of this article is to prospectively compare image quality and diagnostic accuracy of clinically significant prostate cancer with and without endorectal coil (ERC) at 3 T using a combination of T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Twenty-three patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer underwent MRI with and without ERC at the same visit. Patients subsequently underwent radical prostatectomy. Specimens were assessed by whole-mount histopathologic examination. Two radiologists reviewed MR images for image quality (5-point scale) and disease using Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data Systems version 2 (PI-RADSv2). Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were calculated with and without ERC. Additionally, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was correlated with Gleason score and ADC values of each lesion were compared with and without ERC. RESULTS. Image quality was comparable with and without ERC (3.8 vs 3.5). Twenty-nine cancer foci larger than 0.5 cm in diameter were found in 23 patients on histopathologic examination; 18 tumors had a Gleason score of 7 or greater. Two radiologists recorded AUC for tumors with a Gleason score of 7 or greater as 0.96 and 0.96 with ERC and 0.88 and 0.91 without ERC. All 13 tumors with a Gleason score of 3 + 4 were detected with ERC, but only 9 were detected without ERC. One of five tumors with Gleason scores less than 3 + 4 was missed with and without ERC.

Methods:   This series of 3 studies each used a single-arm, post-test-only design to explore the feasibility of implementing multiphasic, community-based cancer screening at the same rural location in 2013, 2016, and 2017. The 2013 event for women screened for 2 cancers (breast and cervix), and the 2016 event for women screened for 3 cancers (breast, cervix, and thyroid). The 2017 event for men screened for 5 cancers (skin, prostate, colorectal, oropharynx, and testes).  Results:   Totals of 473 and 401 women participated in the 2013 and 2016 events, respectively, and 301 men participated in the 2017 event. Staffing for each event varied from 33 to 44 people and relied primarily on in-country medical students and local community members. High rates (mean, 88%) of compliance with referral for follow-up testing at clinics and primary care facilities were observed after the screening events.  Conclusion:   The multiphasic, community-based approach proved feasible for both women and men and resulted in high rates of compliance with follow-up testing. This approach appears highly replicable: it was conducted multiple times across the years with different screening targets, which could be further scaled elsewhere using the same technique.""","""['Kathleen Doyle Lyons', 'Linda S Kennedy', 'Ethan P M Larochelle', 'Gregory J Tsongalis', 'H Sarahi Reyes', 'J C Zuniga-Moya', 'Mary D Chamberlin', 'Martha L Bruce', 'Suyapa Bejarno']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""JCO Glob Oncol""","""['Overall and Multiphasic Findings of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Randomized Cancer Screening Trial.', 'Feasibility of mobile cancer screening and prevention.', 'Recall Efforts Successfully Increase Follow-Up for Cervical Cancer Screening Among Women With Human Papillomavirus in Honduras.', 'Screening for Cervical Cancer With High-Risk Human Papillomavirus Testing: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Screening for Skin Cancer in Adults: An Updated Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Barriers to uptake of cervical cancer screening services in low-and-middle-income countries: a systematic review.', 'Living the best of both worlds: A personal scientific journey.']"""

Castration promotes gland and tumor shrinkage. However, prostate adaptation to androgen deprivation involves striking parallel events, all requiring changes in gene expression. We hypothesized that transcription factors (TF) and other transcription-related genes are needed to orchestrate those changes. In this work, downstream analysis using bioinformatic tools and published microarray data allowed us to identify sixty transcriptional regulators (including 10 TF) and to integrate their function in physiologically relevant networks. Functional associations revealed a connection between Arnt, Bhlhe41 and Dbp circadian rhythm genes with the Ar circuitry and a small gene network centered in Pex14, which might indicate a previously unanticipated metabolic shift. We have also identified human homologs and mapped the corresponding genes to human chromosome regions commonly affected in prostate cancer, with particular attention to the PTEN/HHEX/MXI1 cluster at 10q23-25 (frequently deleted in PCa) and to MAPK1 at 22q11.21 (delete in intermediate risk but not in high risk PCa). Twenty genes were found mutated or with copy number alterations in at least five percent of three cancer cohorts and six of them (PHOX2A, NFYC, EST2, EIF2S1, SSRP1 and PARP1) associated with impacted patient survival.

A novel strategy to treat early stages of bone metastases involves local co-delivery of multiple chemotherapeutic agents to synergistically improve the curative effect and overcome shortcomings of traditional chemotherapy. Herein we show that selenite-doped hydroxyapatite nanoparticles loaded with a hydroxyapatite-binding anti-tumor platinum complex (PtPP-HASe) selectively reduce proliferation of cancer cells without reducing proliferation of bone marrow stem cells. These PtPP-HASe particles were nanocrystalline with selenium (Se) and platinum (Pt) contents ranging between 0-10 and 1.5-3 wt%, respectively. Release kinetics of Se and Pt from PtPP-HASe nanoparticles resulted in a cumulative release of ∼10 and ∼66 wt% after 7 days, respectively. At a Pt/Se ratio of 8, released Pt and Se species selectively reduced cell number of human prostate (PC3) and human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) by a factor of >10 with limited effects on co-cultured human bone marrow stem cells (hBMSc).

Despite the antiproliferative effects of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] on PCa, accumulating evidence indicates that 1,25(OH)2D3 promotes cancer progression by increasing genome plasticity. Our investigation of epigenetic changes associated with vitamin D insensitivity found that 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment reduced the expression levels and activities of DNA methyltransferases 1 and 3B (DNMT1 and DNMT3B, respectively). In silico analysis and reporter assay confirmed that 1,25(OH)2D3 downregulated transcriptional activation of the DNMT3B promoter and upregulated microRNAs targeting the 3'-untranslated regions of DNMT3B. We then profiled DNA methylation in the vitamin D-resistant PC-3 cells and a resistant PCa cell model generated by long-term 1,25(OH)2D3 exposure. Several candidate genes were found to be hypomethylated and overexpressed in vitamin D-resistant PCa cells compared with vitamin D-sensitive cells. Most of the identified genes were associated with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling activation, which is known to promote cancer progression. Among them, we found that inhibition of ribosomal protein S6 kinase A1 (RPS6KA1) promoted vitamin D sensitivity in PC-3 cells. Furthermore, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) prostate cancer data set demonstrated that midline 1 (MID1) expression is positively correlated with tumor stage.

BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP-1), a nuclear-localized deubiquitinating enzyme, has been reported in several human cancers. However, its prognostic role in PCa remains unknown. Herein, we assessed the prognostic and clinicopathologic significance of BAP-1 in PCa.  Materials and methods:   Seventy surgical specimens from radical prostatectomy cases were examined. Two cores per case were selected for construction of tissue microarrays (TMAs). After the exclusion of two cases because of tissue sparsity, BAP-1 immunohistochemical expression was evaluated in 68 cases of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded TMA tissue blocks. The immunohistochemical stain was scored according to proportion of nuclear staining: negative (<10% of tumor cells) or positive (≥10% of tumor cells).  Results:   BAP-1 expression was negative in 30 cases (44.1%) and positive in 38 cases (55.9%). Positive BAP-1 expression was more common in pT3b disease than in pT2 (p=0.038). A high preoperative prostate-specific antigen level was correlated with BAP-1 expression (p=0.014). Age, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, and grade group were not significantly correlated with BAP-1 expression. Patients with positive BAP-1 expression showed significantly shorter disease-free survival (p=0.013). Additionally, BAP-1 was an independent prognostic factor of PCa (p=0.035; hazard ratio, 9.277; 95% confidence interval, 1.165-73.892).

Previous studies had shown that TNBC has high expressions of transmembrane prostate androgen-induced protein (TMEPAI). TMEPAI was known to be induced by TGF-β/Smad signaling and have tumorigenic functions that converting TGF-β from tumor suppressor to tumor promoter and inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Therefore, we aimed to define the role of TMEPAI in triple-negative breast cancer cells treatment using several anti-cancers in the presence of TGF-β.  Methods:   TMEPAI-knock out (KO) was carried out in a triple-negative breast cancer cell, BT549. TMEPAI editing was developed using the CRISPR-Cas9 system using two combinations of sgRNA to remove exon 4 of the TMEPAI gene entirely. Genotyping and proteomic analysis were performed to check the establishment of the TMEPAI-KO cells. Wild type (WT) and KO cells were used to determine inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) of several anti-cancers: doxorubicin, cisplatin, paclitaxel, and bicalutamide in the presence of TGF-β treatment.  Results:   KO cells were successfully established by completely removing the TMEPAI gene, which was proven in genomic and proteomic analysis. Further, in TMEPAI-KO cells, we found a significant reduction of IC50 for doxorubicin and paclitaxel, and minimal effects were seen for cisplatin and bicalutamide. Our findings suggest that TGF-β-induced TMEPAI attenuates the response of TNBC to doxorubicin and paclitaxel, but not to cisplatin and bicalutamide.  Conclusion:   TGF-β induced TMEPAI contributes to the reduced response of TNBC treatment to doxorubicin and paclitaxel, but minimal on cisplatin and bicalutamide.

The following factors were associated with a higher risk of Her2 overexpressed breast cancer: prior exposure to hormone treatment (P = 0.002) and breast cancer in first-degree female relatives (P = 0.001). The following factors were associated with a higher risk of ER-/Her2- breast cancer: black race (P = 0.013), younger age (P = 0.017) and breast cancer in first-degree female relatives (P 0.023).  Conclusions:   There is considerable heterogeneity in risk factors among patients with different subtypes of breast cancer.

LCoR and RIP140 form a nuclear complex in breast cancer cells and are of prognostic value in further prostate and cervical cancer. The purpose of this study was to analyze the regulation of these proteins in the development of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN I-III).  Methods:   Immunohistochemical analysis was obtained to quantify RIP140 and LCoR expression in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia samples. Tissue (n = 94) was collected from patients treated in the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Germany, between 2002 and 2014. Correlations of expression levels with clinical outcome were carried out to assess for prognostic relevance in patients with CIN2 progression. Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for data analysis.  Results:   Nuclear LCoR overexpression correlates significantly with CIN II progression. Nuclear RIP140 expression significantly increases and nuclear LCoR expression decreases with higher grading of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Cytoplasmic RIP140 expression is significantly higher in CIN III than in CIN I or CIN II.  Conclusion:   A decrease of nuclear LCoR expression in line with an increase of dedifferentiation of CIN can be observed. Nuclear LCoR overexpression correlates with CIN II progression indicating a prognostic value of LCoR in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Nuclear and cytoplasmic RIP140 expression increases significantly with higher grading of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia underlining its potential role in the development of pre-cancerous lesions. These findings support the relevance of LCoR and RIP140 in the tumorigenesis indicating a possible role of LCoR and RIP140 as targets for novel therapeutic approaches in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical cancer.""","""['Tilman L R Vogelsang', 'Elisa Schmoeckel', 'Christina Kuhn', 'Thomas Blankenstein', 'Mina Temelkov', 'Helene Heidegger', 'Theresa Maria Kolben', 'Thomas Kolben', 'Sven Mahner', 'Doris Mayr', 'Udo Jeschke', 'Aurelia Vattai']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['Investigation of RIP140 and LCoR as independent markers for poor prognosis in cervical cancer.', 'Prognostic relevance of RIP140 and ERβ expression in unifocal versus multifocal breast cancers: a preliminary report.', 'The role of EP3-receptor expression in cervical dysplasia.', 'Histology of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and the role of biomarkers.', 'Coordinate expression of cytokeratin 8 and cytokeratin 17 immunohistochemical staining in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical squamous cell carcinoma: an immunohistochemical analysis and review of the literature.', 'Prognostic value of long non-coding RNA MALAT1 in hepatocellular carcinoma: A study based on multi-omics analysis and RT-PCR validation.', 'Expression of GMFB in High-Grade Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia and Its Role in Cervical Cancer.', 'The Expression of NRIP1 and LCOR in Endometrioid Endometrial Cancer.', 'The role of EP-2 receptor expression in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.']"""

However, subtle findings especially concerning small local recurrences can still be challenging to interpret and are prone to variability between different readers. Thus, we analyzed interobserver variability, detection rate, and lesion patterns systematically in a homogeneous patient population with low-level biochemical recurrence.  Methods:   We analyzed 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET/CTs in 116 patients with status post-prostatectomy and PSA levels up to 0.6 ng/ml. None of them received ADT or radiotherapy beforehand. Images were interpreted and blinded by two nuclear medicine physicians (R1 and R2). Findings were rated using a 5-point scale concerning local recurrence, lymph nodes, bone lesions, and other findings (1: definitely benign, 2: probably benign, 3: equivocal, 4: probably malignant, 5: definitely malignant). In findings with substantial discrepancies of 2 or more categories and/or potentially leading to differences in further patient management, a consensus reading was done with a third reader (R3). Interobserver agreement was measured by Cohens Kappa analysis after sub-categorizing our classification system to benign (1 + 2), equivocal (3), and malignant (4 + 5). Time course of PSA levels after salvage treatment of patients rated as positive (4 + 5) was analyzed.  Results:   The overall detection rate (categories 4 and 5) was 50% (R1/R2, 49%/51%) and in the PSA subgroups 0-0.2 ng/ml, 0.21-0.3 ng/ml, and 0.31-0.6 ng/ml 24%/27%, 57%/57%, and 65%/68%, respectively. Local recurrence was the most common lesion manifestation followed by lymphatic and bone metastases. The overall agreement in the Cohens Kappa analysis was 0.74 between R1 and R2. For local, lymphatic, and bone sites, the agreement was 0.76, 0.73, and 0.58, respectively. PSA levels of PSMA PET/CT-positive patients after salvage treatment decreased in 75% (27/36) and increased in 25% (9/36). A decrease of PSA, although more frequent in patients with imaging suggesting only local tumor recurrence (86%, 18/21), was also observed in 67% (10/15) of patients with findings of metastatic disease.  Conclusions:   In a highly homogeneous group of prostate cancer patients with early-stage biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy, we could show that 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET/CT has a good detection rate of 50% which is in accordance with literature, with clinically relevant findings even in patients with PSA < 0.21 ng/ml. The interobserver variability is low, particularly concerning assessment of local recurrences and lymph nodes. Therefore, PSMA-PET/CT is a robust diagnostic modality in this patient group for therapy planning.""","""['Jonathan Miksch', 'Dirk Bottke', 'Thomas Krohn', 'Reinhard Thamm', 'Detlef Bartkowiak', 'Christoph Solbach', 'Christian Bolenz', 'Meinrad Beer', 'Thomas Wiegel', 'Ambros J Beer', 'Vikas Prasad']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT Mapping of Prostate Cancer Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy in 270 Patients with a PSA Level of Less Than 1.0 ng/mL: Impact on Salvage Radiotherapy Planning.', '68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy and PSA <0.5\xa0ng/ml.

Materials and methods:   A CTV (clinical target volume)-to-PTV margin ranging from 15 mm in LR (left-right) and SI (superior-inferior) and 5-10 mm in AP (anterior-posterior) direction was applied to all patients. The dosimetric influence of this margin was retrospectively calculated by analysing systematic and random components of inter and intra errors of 31 consecutive intermediate- and high-risk localized PCa patients using daily cone beam computed tomography and kV/kV (kilo-Voltage) imaging. For each patient inter variation was assessed by observing the first 4 treatment days, which led to an offline ART-based treatment plan in case of larger variations.  Results:   Systematic inter uncertainties were larger (1.12 in LR, 2.28 in SI and 1.48 mm in AP) than intra systematic errors (0.44 in LR, 0.69 in SI and 0.80 mm in AP). Same findings for the random error in SI direction with 3.19 (inter) and 2.30 mm (intra), whereas in LR and AP results were alike with 1.89 (inter) and 1.91 mm (intra) and 2.10 (inter) and 2.27 mm (intra), respectively. The calculated margin revealed dimensions of 4-5 mm in LR, 8-9 mm in SI and 6-7 mm in AP direction.

More objective disease-specific indices for predicting outcomes beyond chronological age are necessary.  Objective:   To analyze age-related differences in clinical-genomic prognostic features of aggressiveness in localized PC.  Design, setting, and participants:   A retrospective multicenter cross-sectional study reported the use of the Reporting Recommendations for Tumor Marker Prognostic Studies (REMARK) guidelines. Clinical-genomic data of patients who underwent a prostate biopsy or radical prostatectomy (RP) were obtained from the Decipher Genomic Resource Information Database (NCT02609269).  Intervention:   Our analyses focused on the 22-gene Decipher genomic classifier (GC) and 50-gene (PAM50) models in the biopsy and RP cohorts stratified by age.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary endpoint was the impact of age on GC scores and PAM50 molecular subtypes. Prognostic indices including Decipher GC scores, PAM50 molecular subtypes, National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk categories, and ISUP grade groups (IGGs) were stratified by age using multivariable logistic regression analyses.  Results and limitations:   Within histological low-risk IGGs, there were a higher proportion of patients with high-risk Decipher biopsy scores with age (age <60 yr: 10.1% IGG 1 and 29.9% IGG 2 vs age ≥80 yr: 22% IGG 1 and 37.7% IGG 2). The prevalence of the adverse phenotype luminal B (PAM50-defined) increased with age (age <60 yr: 22.7% and 40.2% vs age ≥80 yr: 29.7% and 49.1%, in patients with IGG 1 and IGG 2, respectively). In IGGs 3-5, no age differences were observed. Multivariable models demonstrated that each age decile entailed a 19% (odds ratio [OR] 1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-1.29, p < 0.001) and a 10% (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.05-1.16) increased probability for a high-risk Decipher biopsy and RP score, respectively. Aside from an obvious selection bias, data on race, family history, prostate volume, and long-term follow-up outcomes were unavailable.  Conclusions:   These data demonstrated that elderly men with favorable pathology (IGG 1-2), might harbor more aggressive disease than younger patients based on validated GC scores.  Patient summary:   The presented clinical-genomic data demonstrate that elderly patients with low-risk prostate cancer might harbor more aggressive disease than their younger counterparts. This suggests that standard well-accepted paradigm of elderly prostate cancer patients not being aggressively treated, based solely on their chronological age, might need to be reconsidered.""","""['Hanan Goldberg', 'Daniel Spratt', 'Thenappan Chandrasekar', 'Zachary Klaassen', 'Christopher J D Wallis', 'Maria Santiago-Jimenez', 'Nick Fishbane', 'Elai Davicioni', 'Rodrigo Noorani', 'Ardalan E Ahmad', 'Jaime Omar Herrera Cáceres', 'Shabbir Alibhai', 'Alejandro Berlin', 'Neil Eric Fleshner']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Re: Clinical-Genomic Characterization Unveils More Aggressive Disease Features in Elderly Prostate Cancer Patients with Low-Grade Disease.', 'Combined value of validated clinical and genomic risk stratification tools for predicting prostate cancer mortality in a high-risk prostatectomy cohort.', 'Tissue-based Genomics Augments Post-prostatectomy Risk Stratification in a Natural History Cohort of Intermediate- and High-Risk Men.', 'A genomic classifier improves prediction of metastatic disease within 5 years after surgery in node-negative high-risk prostate cancer patients managed by radical prostatectomy without adjuvant therapy.', 'Outcomes of Grade Group 2 and 3 Prostate Cancer on Initial Versus Confirmatory Biopsy: Implications for Active Surveillance.', 'A Systematic Review of the Evidence for the Decipher Genomic Classifier in Prostate Cancer.']"""

The quality of the subsequent radiation treatment plan is largely dictated by the needle placements, which varies upon the experience level of the clinicians and the procedure protocols. Real-time plan dose distribution, if available, could be a vital tool to provide more subjective assessment of the needle placements, hence potentially improving the radiation plan quality and the treatment outcome. However, due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in US imaging, real-time multi-needle segmentation in 3D TRUS, which is the major obstacle for real-time dose mapping, has not been realized to date. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based method that enables accurate and real-time digitization of the multiple needles in the 3D TRUS images of HDR prostate brachytherapy.  Methods:   A deep learning model based on the U-Net architecture was developed to segment multiple needles in the 3D TRUS images. Attention gates were considered in our model to improve the prediction on the small needle points. Furthermore, the spatial continuity of needles was encoded into our model with total variation (TV) regularization. The combined network was trained on 3D TRUS patches with the deep supervision strategy, where the binary needle annotation images were provided as ground truth. The trained network was then used to localize and segment the HDR needles for a new patient's TRUS images. We evaluated our proposed method based on the needle shaft and tip errors against manually defined ground truth and compared our method with other state-of-art methods (U-Net and deeply supervised attention U-Net).  Results:   Our method detected 96% needles of 339 needles from 23 HDR prostate brachytherapy patients with 0.290 ± 0.236 mm at shaft error and 0.442 ± 0.831 mm at tip error. For shaft localization, our method resulted in 96% localizations with less than 0.8 mm error (needle diameter is 1.67 mm), while for tip localization, our method resulted in 75% needles with 0 mm error and 21% needles with 2 mm error (TRUS image slice thickness is 2 mm). No significant difference is observed (P = 0.83) on tip localization between our results with the ground truth. Compared with U-Net and deeply supervised attention U-Net, the proposed method delivers a significant improvement on both shaft error and tip error (P < 0.05).  Conclusions:   We proposed a new segmentation method to precisely localize the tips and shafts of multiple needles in 3D TRUS images of HDR prostate brachytherapy. The 3D rendering of the needles could help clinicians to evaluate the needle placements. It paves the way for the development of real-time plan dose assessment tools that can further elevate the quality and outcome of HDR prostate brachytherapy.""","""['Yupei Zhang', 'Yang Lei', 'Richard L J Qiu', 'Tonghe Wang', 'Hesheng Wang', 'Ashesh B Jani', 'Walter J Curran', 'Pretesh Patel', 'Tian Liu', 'Xiaofeng Yang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Automatic multi-catheter detection using deeply supervised convolutional neural network in MRI-guided HDR prostate brachytherapy.', 'Automatic multi-needle localization in ultrasound images using large margin mask RCNN for ultrasound-guided prostate brachytherapy.', 'Prostate CT segmentation method based on nonrigid registration in ultrasound-guided CT-based HDR prostate brachytherapy.', 'Use of three-dimensional radiation therapy planning tools and intraoperative ultrasound to evaluate high dose rate prostate brachytherapy implants.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Landmark tracking in liver US images using cascade convolutional neural networks with long short-term memory.', 'Artificial intelligence in tumor subregion analysis based on medical imaging: A review.', 'Deep learning applications in automatic segmentation and reconstruction in CT-based cervix brachytherapy.', 'A review of deep learning based methods for medical image multi-organ segmentation.', 'Deep learning-based digitization of prostate brachytherapy needles in ultrasound images.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed 150 consecutive prostate cancer patients who underwent LRP between July 2015 and June 2018 in our institution. Patients reporting freedom from using safety pad (0 pads/day) were defined as urinary continent. We evaluated the association of urinary continence recovery after LRP and the perioperative variables, including age, prostatic volume (PV), intravesical prostatic protrusion length (IPPL), membranous urethral length (MUL), and neurovascular bundle (NVB) sparing status. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests were used to compare urinary continence rates between groups. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to identify independent predictors for urinary continence recovery.  Results:   60.6% (91/150), 83.3% (125/150), and 96.0% (144/150) of the patients experienced urinary continence recovery at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. There was significant difference in PV, IPPL, MUL, and NVB sparing between groups stratified by urinary continence status at 3, 6, and 12 months. Kaplan-Meier curves of urinary continence rates showed significant differences between groups stratified by PV (<50 mL vs. ≥50 mL, p < 0.001), IPPL (<5 mm vs. ≥5 mm, p < 0.001), MUL (≥15 mm vs. <15 mm, p < 0.001), and NVB sparing status (yes vs. no, p = 0.003), respectively. On univariate analysis, PV, IPPL, MUL, and NVB sparing were significantly associated with urinary continence recovery (all, p < 0.05). On multivariate analysis, only IPPL (HR = 0.94, p = 0.003) and MUL (HR = 1.10, p < 0.001) were independent predictors for urinary continence recovery.  Conclusion:   Patients with larger IPPL and shorter MUL have higher chances of delayed recovery of urinary continence after LRP.

We find that PHF19 interacts with PRC2 and binds to PRC2 targets on chromatin. PHF19 target genes are involved in proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix organization. Depletion of PHF19 triggers an increase in MTF2/PCL2 chromatin recruitment, with a genome-wide gain in PRC2 occupancy and H3K27me3 deposition. Transcriptome analysis shows that PHF19 loss promotes deregulation of key genes involved in growth, metastasis, invasion, and of factors that stimulate blood vessels formation. Consistent with this, PHF19 silencing reduces cell proliferation, while promotes invasive growth and angiogenesis.

Practices will need a tool that can calculate historical episode reimbursements to succeed in this new model. An automated software-based technology was created to calculate historical episode reimbursements within a large Network of community oncology practices.  Materials and methods:   Claims data between January 1, 2017, and July 31, 2019, were cleaned, organized into episodes, and analyzed with a series of Python computer programs per proposed RO-APM methodology. Averaged Winsorized historical episode reimbursements were first calculated over the entire Network, then over 24 of the largest Practices, and then rerun after application of Clinical Rules to remove misattributed episodes.  Results:   A total of 79,418 RO-APM-defined episodes were generated from 6,512,375 claims lines. A total of 7,086 episodes (8.9%) were removed because of no treatment delivery code within 28 days of treatment planning. The Network of practices had more bone metastases, and breast, cervical, and uterine cancers but less lung and prostate cancer than the RO-APM dataset. Combination-modality episodes were more costly and required more providers than single-modality episodes. Clinical Rules reattributed 2,495 episodes (3.4%) and increased episode reimbursement by +5.8% over all disease sites (+3.7% using volume weighting; P = .001).  Conclusion:   As payment models continue to shift from volume to value, practices will need an automated analytics technology to measure historical costs and prepare for operational and financial transformation. This automated approach can be adapted to future versions of the RO-APM. Our analysis suggests that future iterations of the RO-APM could incorporate Clinical Rules to remove misattributed palliative care episodes and could implement a separate payment for episodes with multiple radiation therapy modalities.""","""['Nikhil G Thaker', 'Joshua Holloway', 'Chas Hodapp', 'Michael Mellen', 'David Fryefield', 'Rehman Meghani', 'Kathryn Tong', 'Christopher M Rose']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""JCO Oncol Pract""","""['Impact of the Radiation Oncology Alternative Payment Model on Brachytherapy Reimbursement.', 'Impact of Patient Stage and Disease Characteristics on the proposed Radiation Oncology Alternative Payment Model (RO-APM).', 'Impact of Radiation Oncology Alternative Payment Model on Community Cancer Centers.', 'Radiation Oncology Alternative Payment Model and Large Urban Academic Centers: Future Implications for Patients and Providers.', 'Community oncology in an era of payment reform.', 'Techno-Economic Feasibility Analysis of a Fully Mobile Radiation Oncology System Using Monte Carlo Simulation.']"""

Moreover, whether PA is associated with better emotional well-being (EWB) in men with low-risk PCa requires further investigation. Accordingly, we examined the association between self-reported PA and the average change in QOL and EWB over time during AS.  Methods:   A total of 630 men on AS were included in this retrospective, longitudinal study from AS initiation until AS discontinuation. Generalized estimated equations were used to determine the association between self-reported PA (independent variable) and QOL and EWB (dependent variables) over time, adjusting for participants' age.  Results:   QOL was higher over time in active ( β^ (95%CI) = 1.14 (0.11, 2.16), P = .029) and highly active participants ( β^ (95%CI) = 1.62 (0.58, 2.67), P = .002) compared to their inactive counterparts. Highly active participants had 55% greater odds of experiencing high EWB relative to inactive participants (OR (95%CI) = 1.55 (1.11, 2.16), P = .010). In men with low EWB at baseline (median = 3 months after diagnosis), the highest levels of PA (>1000 metabolic equivalent-minutes per week) were associated with high EWB over time (OR (95%CI) = 2.17 (1.06, 4.46), P = .034).

The zinc ion (Zn2+), which is a necessary metal ion in the human body, plays a very important role in the regulation of gene transcription and metalloenzyme function. The imbalance of Zn2+ homeostasis is also associated with a variety of neurological diseases. Therefore, it is critically important to accurately image the steady-state changes of Zn2+ in vivo. However, no PA imaging method is currently available for Zn2+. To this end, we designed and synthesized the first PA probe of Zn2+, namely, CR-1 for in situ ratiometric imaging of Zn2+ in deep tissue in vivo. The CR-1molecule, combined with Zn2+, weakened the conjugation system of the π-electron in the CR-1 molecule, which resulted in the blue shift of its absorption peak from 710 nm to 532 nm. The PA signal intensity decreased at 710 nm and increased at 532 nm, and the ratiometric PA signal at these two wavelengths (PA532/PA710) showed a good linear relationship with the concentration of Zn2+ in the range of 0-50 μM, with a detection limit as low as 170 nM. Furthermore, this probe exhibits extremely fast responsiveness, is highly selective, and has excellent biocompatibility. We have used the developed PA probe for the ratiometric PA imaging of Zn2+ in the thigh tissue of mice, and we still can accurately image Zn2+ after covering chicken breast tissue on the surface of mice thigh. In light of these outstanding features, the developed PA probe has high potential for imaging Zn2+ in deep tissues; thus, it will open up new avenues for the study of the complex biochemical processes involving Zn2+ in vivo.""","""['Chaobang Zhang', 'Rongkang Gao', 'Liangliang Zhang', 'Chengbo Liu', 'Zhengmin Yang', 'Shulin Zhao']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['Two-Photon Ratiometric Fluorescence Probe with Enhanced Absorption Cross Section for Imaging and Biosensing of Zinc Ions in Hippocampal Tissue and Zebrafish.', 'Tumor Microenvironment-Activated Ultrasensitive Nanoprobes for Specific Detection of Intratumoral Glutathione by Ratiometric Photoacoustic Imaging.', 'Fluorescence Quenching Nanoprobes Dedicated to In Vivo Photoacoustic Imaging and High-Efficient Tumor Therapy in Deep-Seated Tissue.', 'Synthetic ratiometric fluorescent probes for detection of ions.', 'Design Strategies of Photoacoustic Molecular Probes.', 'Achieving depth-independent lateral resolution in AR-PAM using the synthetic-aperture focusing technique.', 'Background-suppressed tumor-targeted photoacoustic imaging using bacterial carriers.', 'Noninvasive Dual-Modality Photoacoustic-Ultrasonic Imaging to Detect Mammalian Embryo Abnormalities after Prenatal Exposure to Methylmercury Chloride (MMC): A Mouse Study.', 'Targeted contrast agents and activatable probes for photoacoustic imaging of cancer.', ""Activity-based photoacoustic probe for biopsy-free assessment of copper in murine models of Wilson's disease and liver metastasis.""]"""

Incidence and mortality rates are higher in African men. PCa is amenable to early detection by screening which can prevent and reduce cancer deaths. Late-stage presentation and diagnosis often occur due to poor screening practices. This study assessed the knowledge, attitude, prevalence and barriers towards PCa screening among males in an urban area in Nigeria using a mixed method approach.  Methods:   This cross-sectional descriptive study used quantitative and qualitative methods among men aged 40 years and older.

Results:   Respondents were between 40-89 years with a mean age of 52.8 ± 9.9 years. Majority (54.9%) had poor knowledge of prostate cancer and its screening methods however, 65.7% expressed positive attitudes towards screening. Only 73 (21.2%) had ever been screened. The focus groups showed that respondents expressed a willingness to undergo PCa screening. The main barriers to screening were the fears of a positive result, ignorance and financial constraints. Participants preferred male physicians during digital rectal examinations.  Conclusion:   Respondents showed poor levels of knowledge. They expressed positive attitudes towards screening.

In order to identify a ceRNA network and the key lncRNAs in PCa, we constructed a differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs)-differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMis)-differentially expressed mRNAs (DEMs) regulatory network based on the ceRNA theory using data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We found that the DELs-DEMis-DEMs network was composed of 27 DELs nodes, seven DEMis nodes, and three DEMs nodes. The 27 DELs were further analyzed with several public databases to provide meaningful information for understanding the functional roles of lncRNAs in regulatory networks in PCa. We selected ADAMTS9-AS1 to determine its role in PCa and found that ADAMTS9-AS1 significantly influences tumor cell growth and proliferation, suggesting that it plays a tumor suppressive role. In addition, ADAMTS9-AS1 functioned as ceRNA, effectively becoming a sponge for hsa-mir-96 and modulating the expression of PRDM16. These results suggest that ceRNAs could accelerate biomarker discovery and therapeutic strategies for PCa.""","""['Jiahui Wan', 'Shijun Jiang', 'Ying Jiang', 'Wei Ma', 'Xiuli Wang', 'Zikang He', 'Xiaojin Wang', 'Rongjun Cui']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Front Genet""","""['Corrigendum: Data Mining and Expression Analysis of Differential lncRNA ADAMTS9-AS1 in Prostate Cancer.', 'Identification of HCG18 and MCM3AP-AS1 That Associate With Bone Metastasis, Poor Prognosis and Increased Abundance of M2 Macrophage Infiltration in Prostate Cancer.', ""Comprehensive Analysis of lncRNA-Mediated ceRNA Crosstalk and Identification of Prognostic Biomarkers in Wilms' Tumor."", 'Identification of competitive endogenous RNAs network in breast cancer.', 'Importance of long non-coding RNAs in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Long Non-coding RNAs in Prostate Cancer with Emphasis on Second Chromosome Locus Associated with Prostate-1 Expression.', 'It is time to implement molecular classification in endometrial cancer.', 'Bioinformatics analysis of potential Key lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA molecules as prognostic markers and important ceRNA axes in gastric cancer.', 'lncRNA ADAMTS9-AS1/circFN1 Competitively Binds to miR-206 to Elevate the Expression of ACTB, Thus Inducing Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.', 'Identification of lncRNAs and Their Regulatory Relationships with mRNAs in Response to Cryptococcus neoformans Infection of THP-1 Cells.', 'Long noncoding RNA ADAMTS9-AS1 represses ferroptosis of endometrial stromal cells by regulating the miR-6516-5p/GPX4 axis in endometriosis.']"""

A global side effect item that is patient-reported has the potential to inform overall tolerability. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the completion and distribution of such a global single-item measure of side effect burden in five cancer clinical trials.  Methods:   Data from five trials from internal Food and Drug Administration databases that included the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General single-item measure of overall side effect burden (i.e. impact on degree of bother) were analyzed. Completion rates for the side effect bother item, items adjacent to this item, and two non-adjacent items on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General that are related to health-related quality of life were calculated at the baseline assessment and at the 3-month assessment. To evaluate the distribution, the percentage of patients reporting high levels (quite a bit or very much bother) of side effect bother at baseline and 3 months was assessed.  Results:   Completion rates for all items were at least 80% regardless of time point or trial population. However, in three of the five trials, completion rates for the side effect bother item were lower at baseline compared to adjacent and non-adjacent items. This difference was not observed at 3 months. Up to 9.4% of patients reported high levels of side effect bother at baseline.  Conclusion:   Patients may enter trials already reporting some bother from side effects. This can make interpretation of results with respect to the investigational agent under study challenging. Patients may skip an item evaluating side effect bother at baseline, suggesting some difficulty with interpretation of what is being asked.

Our objectives were to develop a multivariable risk prediction model through the integration of clinical, urine-derived cell-free messenger RNA (cf-RNA) and urine cell DNA methylation data capable of noninvasively detecting significant prostate cancer in biopsy naïve patients.  Methods:   Post-digital rectal examination urine samples previously analyzed separately for both cellular methylation and cf-RNA expression within the Movember GAP1 urine biomarker cohort were selected for a fully integrated analysis (n = 207). A robust feature selection framework, based on bootstrap resampling and permutation, was utilized to find the optimal combination of clinical and urinary markers in a random forest model, deemed ExoMeth. Out-of-bag predictions from ExoMeth were used for diagnostic evaluation in men with a clinical suspicion of prostate cancer (PSA ≥ 4 ng/mL, adverse digital rectal examination, age, or lower urinary tract symptoms).  Results:   As ExoMeth risk score (range, 0-1) increased, the likelihood of high-grade disease being detected on biopsy was significantly greater (odds ratio = 2.04 per 0.1 ExoMeth increase, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.78-2.35). On an initial TRUS biopsy, ExoMeth accurately predicted the presence of Gleason score ≥3 + 4, area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.89 (95% CI: 0.84-0.93) and was additionally capable of detecting any cancer on biopsy, AUC = 0.91 (95% CI: 0.87-0.95). Application of ExoMeth provided a net benefit over current standards of care and has the potential to reduce unnecessary biopsies by 66% when a risk threshold of 0.25 is accepted.  Conclusion:   Integration of urinary biomarkers across multiple assay methods has greater diagnostic ability than either method in isolation, providing superior predictive ability of biopsy outcomes.

Our objective is to describe the long-term association of 5ARI use with PCa progression in men on AS.  Materials/subjects and methods:   The cohort of men with low-risk PCa was derived from a prospectively maintained AS database at the Princess Margaret (1995-2016). Pathologic, grade, and volume progression were the primary end points. Kaplan-Meier time-to-event analysis was performed and Cox proportional hazards regression was used to determine predictors of progression where 5ARI exposure was analyzed as a time-dependent variable. Patients who came off AS prior to any progression events were censored at that time.  Results:   The cohort included 288 men with median follow-up of 82 months (interquartile range: 37-120 months). Among non-5ARI users (n = 203); 114 men (56.2%) experienced pathologic progression compared with 24 men (28.2%) in the 5ARI group (n = 85), (p < 0.001).

Setting, participants and outcome measures:   We analysed a case-cohort sample of the prospective European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Heidelberg cohort, including cancer (n=1632), cancer mortality (n=761), CVD (n=1070), CVD mortality (n=381) and a random subcohort (n=2739) with an average follow-up duration of 15.6 years. Concentrations of liver enzymes were measured in prediagnostic blood samples and Prentice-weighted Cox regression models were used to estimate HRs with 95% CIs.  Results:   High ALP levels were associated with increased risk for lung cancer and all-cause mortality (highest vs lowest quartile, multivariable adjusted HR=2.39 (95% CI 1.30 to 4.39), HR=1.31 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.67)), high AST levels with all-cause mortality (HR=1.45 (95% CI 1.15 to 1.82)), and a high De Ritis ratio with prostate cancer risk, all-cause and cancer mortality (HR=1.61 (95% CI 1.10 to 2.36), HR=1.60 (95% CI 1.25 to 2.04), HR=1.67 (95% CI 1.26 to 2.23)). Using cut-points for liver enzyme levels above normal, we observed positive associations for all-cause mortality with ALP, GGT and AST, and assigning a combined risk score resulted in positive associations with all-cause and cause-specific mortality.

Recently, benefit in overall survival was reported in metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer also, and an extension of indication has been granted. Abiraterone is seldom associated with liver toxicity. The clinical management and the outcome of patients with transaminase increase while on abiraterone have not been described.  Patients and method:   We identified 25 men with metastatic prostate cancer and liver function test disorders occurring while on abiraterone treatment from December 2009 to September 2017 in three oncology centres in France.  Results:   Forty-six liver disorder events occurred in 25 patients while on abiraterone treatment. The median age at liver function test increase was 67 (55-85) years. The incidence of aspartate aminotransférase (AST) (24 events) and that of alanine aminotransférase (ALT) (22 events) increases were similar. Liver toxicity was of grade 1, 2 and 3 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. version 4) in 7 (32%), 6 (27%) and 9 (41%) patients for ALT, and in 12 (50%), 6 (25%) and 6 (25%) for AST, respectively. The median time from abiraterone initiation to the detection of liver toxicity was 7.1 (4-95) weeks. The median time from highest ALT/AST increase to normalisation was 6.2 [2-14] weeks. In 13 patients (52%), liver tests spontaneously returned to baseline values, while abiraterone was continued at full dose.  Conclusion:   Liver function test increase is a rare event that typically occurs within the first two months on abiraterone.

Although often considered as beneficial for tumor growth and disease progression, tumor-associated macrophages have also been shown to be detrimental to the tumor depending on the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, understanding the molecular interactions between macrophages and tumor cells in relation to macrophages functional activities such as phagocytosis is critical for a better comprehension of their tumor-modulating action. Still, the characterization of these molecular mechanisms in vivo remains complicated due to the extraordinary complexity of the tumor microenvironment and the broad range of tumor-associated macrophage functions. Thus, there is an increasing demand for in vitro methodologies to study the role of cell-cell interactions in the tumor microenvironment. In the present study, we have developed live co-cultures of macrophages and human prostate tumor cells to assess the phagocytic activity of macrophages using a combination of Confocal and Nomarski Microscopy. Using this model, we have emphasized that this is a sensitive, measurable, and highly reproducible functional assay. We have also highlighted that this assay can be applied to multiple cancer cell types and used as a selection tool for a variety of different types of phagocytosis agonists. Finally, combining with other studies such as gain/loss of function or signaling studies remains possible.

Despite their undisputed value for risk stratification, some GrGr are, a priori, quite heterogeneous in that they contain multiple Gleason patterns (GPs). In this regard, the prognostic significance of GP5 in biopsies with highest GrGr4 is uncertain and evaluated in this study. A search of all core biopsies positive for prostate cancer reviewed after 2005 was performed, and 71 cases with highest GrGr4 containing GP5 (i.e., 3 + 5 = 8 or 5 + 3 = 8; referred to as GrGr4/GP5pos) eligible for inclusion were identified. In addition, 95 core biopsy cases with highest GrGr4 and no GP5 (i.e, 4 + 4 = 8; referred to as GrGr4/GP5neg) were selected for comparison. Multiple pathologic parameters, including volume and amount of GP4, and clinical variables were collected to evaluate the influence of GP5 on disease recurrence, development of metastases, and disease-specific death. GrGr4/GP5pos cases did not show, as a group, statistically significant differences in prostatectomy findings, disease recurrence, metastases, and disease-specific mortality when compared with GrGr4/GP5neg cases. In addition, the risk of all outcomes evaluated in the study did not differ between the whole GrGr4/GP5pos and GrGr4/GP5neg groups. However, Kaplan-Meier analysis found that GrGr4/GP5pos cases with a significant amount of GP4 did show a higher risk of prostate cancer-specific death as well as bone and visceral metastases. Univariate Cox regression demonstrated that preoperative prostate specific antigen (PSA), total number of positive cores, and global GrGr5 were also associated with a higher chance of disease-specific death. In a multivariate model, only global GrGr5 and PSA >20 ng/dL remained statistically significant. This study suggests that the mere presence of GP5 in core biopsies with highest GrGr4 disease may not portend a worse prognosis. In these cases, accounting for the case-wide volume of GP4 by reporting a global GrGr appears to be more relevant as it identifies a subset of GrGr4/GP5pos patients with global GrGr5 who have a higher risk of metastases and prostate cancer-specific mortality.""","""['Andres M Acosta', 'Mary-Ellen Taplin', 'Douglas A Mata', ""Anthony V D'Amico"", 'Michelle S Hirsch']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Hum Pathol""","""['Early prostate-specific antigen relapse after radical retropubic prostatectomy: prediction on the basis of preoperative and postoperative tumor characteristics.', 'Assessing the Optimal Timing for Early Salvage Radiation Therapy in Patients with Prostate-specific Antigen Rise After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Preoperative Gleason score, percent of positive prostate biopsies and PSA in predicting biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'The impact of the 2005 international society of urological pathology consensus conference on standard Gleason grading of prostatic carcinoma in needle biopsies.', 'Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.']"""

Corticosteroids and estrogens are also useful agents in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, oral estrogens are associated with thromboembolic events, which limits their use, and transdermal estrogens may offer a safer alternative. This study was carried out to determine the safety and effectiveness of transdermal estrogens in CRPC.  Patients and methods:   Forty-one patients with CRPC and steroid-resistant prostate cancer were eligible for this dose-escalation study of transdermal estradiol. A starting dose of 50 mcg/24 hours was applied and increased if prostate-specific antigen (PSA) rose > 5 ng/mL in steps to 300 mcg/24 hours. The primary endpoint was PSA response, and secondary outcomes included incidence of thromboembolic events and progression-free survival. Patients who progressed were offered diethylstilbestrol.  Results:   Five (13%) of 40 patients had > 50% PSA reduction for at least 1 month at any transdermal estradiol dose. No venous-thromboembolic events were observed, and responses plateaued at 200 mcg/24 hours. A correlation between PSA response and rising sex hormone binding globulin was seen. Fifty percent of patients subsequently responded to low-dose diethylstilbestrol.  Conclusion:   Transdermal estradiol appears to be a low toxicity treatment option to control CRPC after failure of steroid therapy. Modulation of sex hormone binding globulin by transdermal estradiol may be one mechanism of action of estrogens on CRPC.

Methods:   We searched the international pharmacovigilance database VigiBase for men (n=6 560 565 individual case safety reports) presenting with aLQTS, TdP, or sudden death associated with ADT. In cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells from men, we studied electrophysiological effects of ADT and dihydrotestosterone.  Results:   Among subjects receiving ADT in VigiBase, we identified 184 cases of aLQTS (n=168) and/or TdP (n=68; 11% fatal), and 99 with sudden death. Of the 10 ADT drugs examined, 7 had a disproportional association (reporting odds ratio=1.4-4.7; P<0.05) with aLQTS, TdP, or sudden death. The minimum and median times to sudden death were 0.25 and 92 days, respectively. The androgen receptor antagonist enzalutamide was associated with more deaths (5430/31 896 [17%]; P<0.0001) than other ADT used for prostate cancer (4208/52 089 [8.1%]).

Reversion mutations that restore BRCA1/2 function have been shown to be responsible for resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors, however there is no information on the sequential use of these agents in prostate cancer.  Case presentation:   A patient with mCRPC associated with a germline BRCA2 mutation was sequentially treated with carboplatin and the PARP inhibitor rucaparib. Genomic profiling of the available baseline tumor and progression blood samples using next-generation sequencing panel tests identified polyclonal BRCA2 reversion mutations post carboplatin treatment but prior to rucaparib treatment. A total of 12 somatic reversion mutations were detected and ranged from small indels to larger deletions of up to 387 amino acids. These alterations are all predicted to restore the BRCA2 open reading frame and potentially protein function. The patient received limited benefit while on rucaparib, likely due to these reversion mutations observed prior to treatment.  Conclusions:   Here we report a case of a patient with prostate cancer who received a platinum agent and PARP inhibitor sequentially and in whom polyclonal BRCA2 reversion mutations were identified as the likely mechanism of acquired resistance to carboplatin and primary resistance to PARP inhibition.

These effects provide a novel mechanism by which mTORC1 signaling impairs the function of MNK2 and thereby decreases eIF4E phosphorylation. MNK2[S74A] knock-in cells show enhanced phosphorylation of eIF4E and S6K1 (i.e., increased mTORC1 signaling), enlarged cell size, and increased invasive and transformative capacities. MNK2[Ser74] phosphorylation was inversely correlated with disease progression in human prostate tumors. MNK inhibition exerted anti-proliferative effects in prostate cancer cells in vitro.

Multiple imputation with chained equations was used to impute a specific stage at diagnosis for cases with ""unknown"" and missing status. We estimated the age-standardized incidence rates by stage at diagnosis from 1993 to 2014, and used joinpoint linear regression models to assess changes in trend.  Results:   Joinpoint analyses after imputation showed that localized cancer was stable from 1993 to 2000, followed by a pronounced but insignificant increase through 2003 (from 12.1 per 100,000 in 2001 to 34.1 per 100,000 in 2003), and a significant increase thereafter [annual percentage change (APC), 4.1%]. For regional cancer, the imputed data showed that the increasing trend lasted from 1993 to 2006 (APC, 12.5%), then leveled off through 2014. For distant prostate cancer, the imputed data showed the increasing trend continued from 1993 to 2004 (APC, 2.4%), and started to marginally decline thereafter (APC, -2.2%).  Conclusions:   Our study confirmed a significantly rapid increase in localized prostate cancer after the spread of PSA screening in Japan, with a marginal decrease in distant prostate cancer after 2004.

Bone metastases are frequently the only source for obtaining metastatic tumor tissue. However, the success rate of CT-guided bone biopsies for molecular analyses in mPC patients is approximately only 40%. PET using 68Ga prostate-specific membrane antigen (68Ga-PSMA) is a promising tool to improve the harvest rate of bone biopsies for molecular analyses. The aim of this study was to determine the success rate of 68Ga-PSMA-guided bone biopsies for molecular diagnostics in mPC patients. Methods: Within a prospective multicenter whole-genome sequencing trial (NCT01855477), 69 mPC patients underwent 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT before bone biopsy. The primary endpoint was the success rate (tumor percentage ≥ 30%) of 68Ga-PSMA-guided bone biopsies. At biopsy sites, 68Ga-PSMA uptake was quantified using rigid-body image registration of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT and interventional CT. Actionable somatic alterations were identified. Results: The success rate of 68Ga-PSMA-guided biopsies for molecular analyses was 70%. At biopsy sites categorized as positive, inconclusive, or negative for 68Ga-PSMA uptake, 70%, 64%, and 36% of biopsies were tumor-positive (≥30%), respectively (P = 0.0610). In tumor-positive biopsies, 68Ga-PSMA uptake was significantly higher (P = 0.008), whereas radiodensity was significantly lower (P = 0.006). With an area under the curve of 0.84 and 0.70, both 68Ga-PSMA uptake (SUVmax) and radiodensity (mean Hounsfield units) were strong predictors for a positive biopsy. Actionable somatic alterations were detected in 73% of the sequenced biopsies. Conclusion: In patients with mPC, 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT improves the success rate of CT-guided bone biopsies for molecular analyses, thereby identifying actionable somatic alterations in more patients. Therefore, 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT may be considered for guidance of bone biopsies in both clinical practice and clinical trials.""","""['Anouk C de Jong', 'Minke Smits', 'Job van Riet', 'Jurgen J Fütterer', 'Tessa Brabander', 'Paul Hamberg', 'Inge M van Oort', 'Ronald de Wit', 'Martijn P Lolkema', 'Niven Mehra', 'Marcel Segbers', 'Astrid A M van der Veldt']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', '68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT and Diffusion MRI Targeting for Cone-Beam CT-Guided Bone Biopsies of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients.', '68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT derived quantitative volumetric tumor parameters for classification and evaluation of therapeutic response of bone metastases in prostate cancer patients.', '68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in prostate cancer.', 'Can Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT replace conventional imaging modalities for primary lymph node and bone staging of prostate cancer?', 'Incorporating PSMA-Targeting Theranostics Into Personalized Prostate Cancer Treatment: a Multidisciplinary Perspective.', 'Prior PSMA PET-CT Imaging and Hounsfield Unit Impact on Tumor Yield and Success of Molecular Analyses from Bone Biopsies in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods and materials:   Three escalating dose-per-fraction schedules were designed to yield similar predicted tumor control while maintaining equivalent predicted late toxicity. HPFX levels I, II, and III were carried out sequentially and delivered schedules of 64.7 Gy/22 fx/2.94 Gy, 58.08 Gy/16 fx/3.63 Gy, and 51.6 Gy/12 fx/4.3 Gy, respectively with next level escalations contingent upon acceptable gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. The primary endpoints were biochemical control and toxicity.  Results:   A total of 347 patients were recruited by 5 institutions with 101, 111, and 135 patients treated on HPFX levels I, II, and III with median follow-ups of 100, 85.5, and 61.7 months, respectively (83.2 months combined).

Among clinical covariates, only Gleason score reached near significance in multivariate analysis (P = .054). Twenty-six patients failed biochemically (crude incidence of 7.5%), and there were 5 cause-specific deaths. GI and genitourinary toxicities were acceptable and similar across the 3 HPFX levels.

However, MAS is technically demanding and associated with a prolonged learning curve. Robot-assisted laparoscopy has made progress in overcoming these challenges.  Objective:   The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a new robot-assisted surgical system (the Versius Surgical System; CMR Surgical, Cambridge, UK) for renal and prostate procedures in a preclinical setting, at the IDEAL-D phase 0.  Design, setting, and participants:   Cadaveric sessions were conducted to evaluate the ability of the system to complete all surgical steps required for a radical nephrectomy, prostatectomy, and pelvic lymph node dissection. A live animal (porcine) model was also used to assess the surgical device in performing radical nephrectomy safely and effectively. Procedures were performed by experienced renal and prostate surgeons, supported by a full operating room team.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Surgical access and reach were evaluated by the lead surgeon using a visual analogue scale. The precise surgical steps conducted to make the assessment that the procedures could be completed fully were recorded, as well as instruments used (including manual laparoscopic instruments) and endoscope angle.  Results and limitations:   In total, all 24 procedures were completed successfully in cadavers by eight different lead surgeons. Positioning of the ports and bedside units reflected the lead surgeon's preferred laparoscopic set-up and enabled good surgical access and reach, as quantified by a median visual analogue score of ≥6.5. Radical nephrectomies performed in pigs were all completed successfully, with no device- or non-device-related intraoperative complications recorded. Testing in human cadavers and pig models balances the bias introduced by each model; however, it is impossible to completely replicate the experience and performance of the robot for surgery in live humans.  Conclusions:   This is the first preclinical assessment of the Versius Surgical System for renal and prostate procedures. The safety and effectiveness of the system have been demonstrated and warrant progressive assessment in a clinical setting utilising the IDEAL-D framework.  Patient summary:   In this report, we looked at the usability of a new robot-assisted surgical device for renal and prostate surgery by testing the system in cadavers and pigs. We found that a number of different surgeons and operating team personnel were able to use the system to successfully complete the procedures under evaluation. We conclude that the system is ready to be tested in live human studies.""","""['Benjamin C Thomas', 'Mark Slack', 'Muddassar Hussain', 'Neil Barber', 'Ashish Pradhan', 'Eoin Dinneen', 'Grant D Stewart']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Preclinical evaluation of the versius surgical system, a new robot-assisted surgical device for use in minimal access general and colorectal procedures.', 'Robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery for gynecologic and urologic oncology: an evidence-based analysis.', 'Interim safety analysis of the first-in-human clinical trial of the Versius surgical system, a new robot-assisted device for use in minimal access surgery.', 'Methods for training of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Assessment of the Versius Robotic Surgical System in Minimal Access Surgery: A Systematic Review.', 'Preclinical evaluation of the Versius surgical system: A next-generation surgical robot for use in minimal access prostate surgery.', 'New multiport robotic surgical systems: a comprehensive literature review of clinical outcomes in urology.', ""Impact of Robotic Technologies on Prostate Cancer Patients' Choice for Radical Treatment."", 'Evaluation of the Versius Robotic System for Infant Surgery-A Study in Piglets of Less than 10 kg Body Weight.', 'Robot-assisted Nissen fundoplication with the new HUGO™ Robotic assisted system: First worldwide report with system description, docking settings and video.']"""

A total of 279 PCa specimens from patients who underwent radical prostatectomy and 50 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) specimens were collected to construct tissue microarray, which were subjected to immunohistochemical staining for LIMK1 expression subsequently. Logistic and Cox regression analysis were used to evaluate the relationship between LIMK1 expression and clinicopathological features of patients with PCa. Immunohistochemical staining assay demonstrated that LIMK1 expression was significantly higher in PCa than BPH specimens (77.1% vs 26.0%; P < .001). LIMK1 expression was significantly higher in positive lymph node specimens than corresponding PCa specimens (P = .002; P < .001). Up-regulation of LIMK1 was associated with prostate volume, prostate-specific antigen, prostate-specific antigen density, Gleason score, T stage, lymph node metastases, extracapsular extension and seminal vesicle invasion, and positive surgical margin. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that LIMK1 was an independent risk factor for PCa lymph node metastasis (P < .05). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that the up-regulation of LIMK1 was an independent risk factor for biochemical recurrence. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that up-regulation LIMK1 was associated with shortened biochemical-free survival (BFS) after radical prostatectomy (P < .001). In conclusion, LIMK1 was significantly up-regulated in PCa and positive lymph node specimens and correlated with lymph node metastasis and shortened BFS of PCa.

Here, we validated these results with samples of human prostate cancer and explored the role of a CD24-p53 axis in racial disparities of prostate cancer.  Methods:   Samples of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded prostate cancer from 141 European Americans (EAs) and 147 African Americans (AAs) in two independent sample cohorts were assessed for protein expression of CD24, mutant p53, mouse double minute 2 human homolog (MDM2), and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (ARF) using immunohistochemical analyses. All samples were analyzed for TP53R175H and TP53R273H .  Results:   CD24, mutant p53, MDM2, and ARF proteins were expressed in 55%, 24%, 39%, and 68% of prostate cancer samples, respectively. CD24 and mutant p53 were present more frequently in late-stage and metastatic prostate cancer. The presence of CD24 was associated with a greater than fourfold risk of metastasis, which included lymph node and distant metastases. H score analysis showed positive correlations of CD24 expression with mutant p53 (r = .308, P < .001) and MDM2 (r = .227, P = .004). There was a negative correlation for CD24 with ARF (r = -.280, P < .001). A racial disparity was evident for CD24 (AAs/EAs: 64% vs 47%; P = .004) but not for mutant p53 (AA/EA: 28% vs 21%; P = .152). In 32 CD24+ /mutant p53+ cases, a TP53R273H mutation was found in five cases, but no TP53R175H mutation was found.

Materials and methods:   Single-center prospectively collected data on patients with prostate cancer who underwent primary focal high intensity focused ultrasound from January 2016 to July 2018 were included. All patients underwent a 12-core biopsy with magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion biopsy depending on the presence of targetable lesions. Any Grade Group was allowed, however only patients with localized disease were included. The primary outcome was oncologic control, defined as negative followup in-field biopsy of treated cancer. Prostate specific antigen, Sexual Health Inventory for Men, International Prostate Symptom Score and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite domain scores were assessed 3-monthly till 12 months. Biopsy was performed at 6 or 12 months for high or low/intermediate risk cancer, respectively.  Results:   Fifty-two patients with minimum followup of 12 months were included in the study. The majority of patients (67%) had cancer Grade Group 2 or greater. Fifteen patients (28.8%) underwent complete transurethral prostate resection/holmium laser enucleation of prostate procedure for debulking large prostates to avoid postoperative urinary retention. Among 30 (58%) patients who underwent followup biopsies, 25 (83%) had negative in-field biopsy results and 4 (13%) had de-novo positive out-of-field biopsy. Only 5 major complications (all grade III) in 4 patients were noted. Urinary symptoms returned to near baseline questionnaire scores within 3-6 months. Sexual function returned to baseline at 12 months.  Conclusions:   Focal high intensity focused ultrasound is a safe and effective treatment for patients with localized clinically significant prostate cancer with acceptable short-term oncologic and functional outcomes.

Studies addressing the efficacy of different depot formulations of long acting luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonists in the Brazilian population are lacking. We aimed to compare the efficacy of three schedules of leuprolide acetate in lowering PSA in a real world population.  Materials and methods:   We reviewed the medical records of patients with prostate cancer seen at our institution between January 2007 and July 2018. We analyzed patients treated with long-acting leuprolide acetate and grouped these patients into three strata according to the administration of ADT every 1, 3 or 6 months. The primary outcome was the serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels at 6 and 12 months after treatment initiation. We used Friedman test to compare the distribution of PSA levels at baseline and at 6 and 12 months within each treatment stratum. We considered two-sided P values < 0.05 as statistically significant. We analyzed toxicity descriptively.  Results:   We analyzed a total of 932 patients, with a median age of 72 years and a median time since diagnosis of prostate cancer of 8.5 months. ADT was administered monthly in 115 patients, quarterly in 637, and semiannually in 180. Nearly half of the patients had locally advanced disease. In comparison with baseline, median serum PSA levels were reduced at 12 months by at least 99.7% in the three strata (P < 0.001 in all cases). Sexual impotence and hot flashes were the most frequently reported toxicities.  Conclusion:   To our knowledge, this is the largest assessment of real-world data on alternative schedules of leuprolide in a Brazilian population.

MAGI-2 expression was associated with clinical parameters including tumor stage, lymph node status, Gleason score, PSA level, and biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer. The relative expression of MAGI-2 mRNA was lower in the tumor tissue in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and sequencing data (P < 0.001). There was no difference in MAGI-2 protein expression between tumor and normal tissues in tissue microarray (TMA) results. MAGI-2 expression was associated with pathological tumor stage (P = 0.02), Gleason score (P = 0.05), and preoperation prostate-specific antigen (PSA; P = 0.04). A positive correlation was identified between MAGI-2 and phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) expressions through the analysis of TCGA and TMA data (P < 0.0001). Patients with higher MAGI-2 expression had longer biochemical recurrence-free survival in the univariate analysis (P = 0.005), which indicates an optimal prognostic value of MAGI-2 in Han Chinese patients with prostate cancer. In conclusion, MAGI-2 expression gradually decreases with tumor progression, and can be used as a predictor of tumor recurrence in Chinese patients.""","""['Zhi Cao', 'Jin Ji', 'Fu-Bo Wang', 'Chen Kong', 'Huan Xu', 'Ya-Long Xu', 'Xi Chen', 'Yong-Wei Yu', 'Ying-Hao Sun']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['MAGI-2 in prostate cancer: an immunohistochemical study.', 'FASN Protein Overexpression Indicates Poor Biochemical Recurrence-Free Survival in Prostate Cancer.', 'High expression of ASPM correlates with tumor progression and predicts poor outcome in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Up regulation of the Hippo signalling effector YAP1 is linked to early biochemical recurrence in prostate cancers.', 'MicroRNA-139 is a predictor of prostate cancer recurrence and inhibits growth and migration of prostate cancer cells through cell cycle arrest and targeting IGF1R and AXL.', 'A New Story of the Three Magi: Scaffolding Proteins and lncRNA Suppressors of Cancer.', 'MAGI1, a Scaffold Protein with Tumor Suppressive and Vascular Functions.']"""

Although dysregulation of microRNA-103a-3p (miR-103a-3p) in multiple human cancers has been reported, its expression in prostate cancer (PCa) remains unknown and there is currently no research on the relationship between miR-103a-3p and tumor protein D52 (TPD52) in PCa. Our aim in this study was to explore the effect and potential mechanism of miR-103a-3p in PCa. qRT-PCR was performed to detected the level of miR-103a-3p in PCa tissues and cells, and in normal tissues. Colony, wound-healing, invasion, proliferation, and apoptosis assays were performed in search miR-103a-3p effect in PCa. TargetScan was used to predict potential targets of miR-103a-3p. Additionally, dual-luciferase reporter, western blot, and immunofluorescence assays were performed to detected the target gene of miR-103a-3p. Finally, we explore the differences in tumor xenograft experiments between nude mice injected with stably miR-103a-3p expressing cells and those expressing a miR-negative control. Low level of miR-103a-3p was detected in PCa tissues and cells, when compared with normal tissues. Enhancement of miR-103a-3p significantly inhibited migration and invasion of PCa cells, and negatively regulated expression of the oncogenic tumor protein D52 (TPD52) through direct binding to its 3'-UTR. Interestingly, overexpression of TPD52 significantly attenuated the effect of mir-103a-3p on PCa. Our study provides the first evidence that miR-103a-3p directly targets TPD52 and inhibits the proliferation and invasion of PCa. This finding helps clarify the role of mir-103a-3p-TPD52 axis in PCa and may provide new therapeutic targets for the disease.""","""['Jiyue Ge', 'Likai Mao', 'Weiqiang Xu', 'Wenge Fang', 'Ningning Wang', 'Dawen Ye', 'Zhuang Dong', 'Han Guan', 'Chao Guan']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Invest Surg""","""['Down-regulation of EVA1A by miR-103a-3p promotes hepatocellular carcinoma cells proliferation and migration.', 'Long-Noncoding RNA FGD5-AS1 Enhances the Viability, Migration, and Invasion of Glioblastoma Cells by Regulating the miR-103a-3p/TPD52 Axis.', 'MicroRNA-449b-5p suppresses cell proliferation, migration and invasion by targeting TPD52 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.', 'Exosomal Circ-XIAP Promotes Docetaxel Resistance in Prostate Cancer by Regulating miR-1182/TPD52 Axis.', 'Tumour-suppressive microRNA-224 inhibits cancer cell migration and invasion via targeting oncogenic TPD52 in prostate cancer.', 'Down-regulation of EVA1A by miR-103a-3p promotes hepatocellular carcinoma cells proliferation and migration.', 'Immunomodulatory Properties of Human Breast Milk: MicroRNA Contents and Potential Epigenetic Effects.', 'miR-139-5p Was Identified as Biomarker of Different Molecular Subtypes of Breast Carcinoma.', 'Dysregulation of the miRNome unveils a crosstalk between obesity and prostate cancer: miR-107 asa personalized diagnostic and therapeutic tool.', 'The promotional effect of microRNA-103a-3p in cervical cancer cells by regulating the ubiquitin ligase FBXW7 function.']"""

Using these images effectively typically requires the physician to manually segment the prostate to define the margins used for accurate registration, targeting, and other guidance techniques. However, manual prostate segmentation is a time-consuming and difficult intraoperative process, often occurring while the patient is under sedation (biopsy) or anesthetic (brachytherapy). Minimizing procedure time with a 3D TRUS prostate segmentation method could provide physicians with a quick and accurate prostate segmentation, and allow for an efficient workflow with improved patient throughput to enable faster patient access to care. The purpose of this study was to develop a supervised deep learning-based method to segment the prostate in 3D TRUS images from different facilities, generated using multiple acquisition methods and commercial ultrasound machine models to create a generalizable algorithm for needle-based prostate cancer procedures.  Methods:   Our proposed method for 3D segmentation involved prediction on two-dimensional (2D) slices sampled radially around the approximate central axis of the prostate, followed by reconstruction into a 3D surface. A 2D U-Net was modified, trained, and validated using images from 84 end-fire and 122 side-fire 3D TRUS images acquired during clinical biopsies and brachytherapy procedures. Modifications to the expansion section of the standard U-Net included the addition of 50% dropouts and the use of transpose convolutions instead of standard upsampling followed by convolution to reduce overfitting and improve performance, respectively. Manual contours provided the annotations needed for the training, validation, and testing datasets, with the testing dataset consisting of 20 end-fire and 20 side-fire unseen 3D TRUS images. Since predicting with 2D images has the potential to lose spatial and structural information, comparisons to 3D reconstruction and optimized 3D networks including 3D V-Net, Dense V-Net, and High-resolution 3D-Net were performed following an investigation into different loss functions. An extended selection of absolute and signed error metrics were computed, including pixel map comparisons [dice similarity coefficient (DSC), recall, and precision], volume percent differences (VPD), mean surface distance (MSD), and Hausdorff distance (HD), to assess 3D segmentation accuracy.  Results:   Overall, our proposed reconstructed modified U-Net performed with a median [first quartile, third quartile] absolute DSC, recall, precision, VPD, MSD, and HD of 94.1 [92.6, 94.9]%, 96.0 [93.1, 98.5]%, 93.2 [88.8, 95.4]%, 5.78 [2.49, 11.50]%, 0.89 [0.73, 1.09] mm, and 2.89 [2.37, 4.35] mm, respectively. When compared to the best-performing optimized 3D network (i.e., 3D V-Net with a Dice plus cross-entropy loss function), our proposed method performed with a significant improvement across nearly all metrics. A computation time <0.7 s per prostate was observed, which is a sufficiently short segmentation time for intraoperative implementation.  Conclusions:   Our proposed algorithm was able to provide a fast and accurate 3D segmentation across variable 3D TRUS prostate images, enabling a generalizable intraoperative solution for needle-based prostate cancer procedures. This method has the potential to decrease procedure times, supporting the increasing interest in needle-based 3D TRUS approaches.""","""['Nathan Orlando', 'Derek J Gillies', 'Igor Gyacskov', 'Cesare Romagnoli', ""David D'Souza"", 'Aaron Fenster']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Effect of dataset size, image quality, and image type on deep learning-based automatic prostate segmentation in 3D ultrasound.', 'Ultrasound prostate segmentation based on multidirectional deeply supervised V-Net.', 'A deep learning method for real-time intraoperative US image segmentation in prostate brachytherapy.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Deep learning-based automatic segmentation of images in cardiac radiography: A promising challenge.', 'A Robust and Explainable Structure-Based Algorithm for Detecting the Organ Boundary From Ultrasound Multi-Datasets.', 'A novel approach for automatic segmentation of prostate and its lesion regions on magnetic resonance imaging.', 'A Review of Deep Learning Applications in Lung Ultrasound Imaging of COVID-19 Patients.', 'Automatic femoral articular cartilage segmentation using deep learning in three-dimensional ultrasound images of the knee.', 'Polar transform network for prostate ultrasound segmentation with uncertainty estimation.']"""

Fifty consecutive patients with biopsy-proven PCa were included as study group and 50 consecutive patients with negative biopsy were included as a control group. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was used to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) to compare the accuracy of the different parameters in the diagnosis as well as the presence of high-grade PCa (Gleason score 8-9) at PNB.

Presence of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) is associated with signature characteristics of PCa development such as cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, angiogenesis, migration, invasion, and poor patient survival. Therefore, we developed a preclinical multimodal imaging strategy targeted at RAGE to diagnose and monitor PCa.  Methods:   In this work, RAGE-targeted multimodal nanoparticles (64Cu-Cy5-G4-CML) were synthesized and rendered functional for nuclear and optical imaging using previously established methods. The probe's binding affinity and targeting specificity was assessed in androgen-dependent (LNCaP) and androgen-independent (DU145) prostate cancer cells using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. In vivo PET-CT imaging was used to evaluate RAGE levels in DU145 and LNCaP xenograft models in mice. Then, tumors were excised post-imaging for histological staining and autoradiography to further assess RAGE levels and targeting efficiency of the tracer. Finally, RAGE levels from human PCa samples of varying Gleason Scores were evaluated using Western blot and immunohistochemical staining.  Results:   PCa cell culture studies confirmed adequate RAGE-targeting with 64Cu-Cy5-G4-CML with KD between 360 and 540 nM as measured by flow cytometry. In vivo PET-CT images of PCa xenografts revealed favorable kinetics, rapid blood clearance, and a non-homogenous, enhanced uptake in tumors, which varied based on cell type and tumor size with mean uptake between 0.5 and 1.4%ID/g.

It may also promote various malignancies like prostate cancer and breast cancer. However, even after having this severe illness, there is no effective cure yet. This situation urges the need for effective chemotherapeutics or vaccination to tackle this severe complication.  Methods:   A combinatorial screening algorithm was applied to design a subunit vaccine consisting of B-cell epitopes, CTL- and HTL epitopes along with a suitable adjuvant (TLR-4 agonist) and linkers. The conservancy of CTL, HTL, and B-cell epitopes was also determined. Further, physicochemical characterization, antigenicity, and allergenicity were determined to check the safety and immunogenic behavior of the designed vaccine candidate. Later on, the 3D structure of the vaccine protein was determined, followed by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation with TLR-4 to check their binding free energy and complex stability.  Result:   A subunit vaccine of 964 amino acid residues was developed, having good immunogenicity and non-allergenicity behavior. The designed subunit vaccine has HTL epitopes with their ability to induce the release of IFN-γ cytokine. The sorted HTL and CTL epitopes were found to be conserved among two available strains of HCMV. It has also shown an excellent binding affinity with the TLR-4 receptor along with the formation of the stable complex as determined by a molecular dynamics simulation study.

Objective:   To determine the effect of NADT on patient's long-term recovery following surgery.  Design, setting, and participants:   From March 2011 to August 2013, 5808 men with newly diagnosed prostate were followed up to 24 mo. A cohort of men who received NADT prior to robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP; n=51) was compared 1:3 with a matched group that underwent RALP only (n=153).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Patients were matched on Charlson comorbidities, biopsy Gleason score, and node status on final pathology. The Kruskall-Wallis test was used to compare the groups on their bowel, urinary, sexual, and hormonal domains of the 26-item Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 mo postoperatively.  Results and limitations:   The urinary irritative, urinary incontinence, and bowel domains were similar in the two groups during the 24 mo (p=0.832, 0.901, and 0.732, respectively). In the hormonal domain, the NADT group did worse (p<0.001). The sexual domain was also worse for the NADT group. However, when accounting for nerve sparing, there was no significant difference in sexual outcomes between the two groups (p=0.069).  Conclusions:   Patients who received NADT prior to RALP do not have worse sexual function, but have worse hormonal scores for up to 2yr after surgery.

Moreover, antibiotic resistance is increasing and influences the efficacy of pre-biopsy prophylactic regimens. Therefore, increasing antibiotic resistance may impact on clinical care, which probably results in differences between hospitals. The objective of our study is to determine the (variability in) current practices of PB in the Netherlands and to gain insight into Dutch urologists' perceptions of fluoroquinolone resistance and biopsy related infections.  Methods:   An online questionnaire was prepared using SurveyMonkey® platform and distributed to all 420 members of the Dutch Association of Urology, who work in 81 Dutch hospitals. Information about PB techniques and periprocedural antimicrobial prophylaxis was collected. Urologists' perceptions regarding pre-biopsy antibiotic prophylaxis in an era of antibiotic resistance was assessed. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed.  Results:   One hundred sixty-one responses (38.3%) were analyzed representing 65 (80.3%) of all Dutch hospitals performing PB. Transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy (TRUSPB) was performed in 64 (98.5%) hospitals. 43.1% of the hospitals (also) used other image-guided biopsy techniques. Twenty-three different empirical prophylactic regimens were reported among the hospitals. Ciprofloxacin was most commonly prescribed (84.4%). The duration ranged from one pre-biopsy dose (59.4%) to 5 days extended prophylaxis. 25.2% of the urologists experienced ciprofloxacin resistance as a current problem in the prevention of biopsy related infections and 73.6% as a future problem.  Conclusions:   There is a wide variation in practice patterns among Dutch urologists. TRUSPB is the most commonly used biopsy technique, but other image-guided biopsy techniques are increasingly used. Antimicrobial prophylaxis is not standardized and prolonged prophylaxis is common. The wide variation in practice patterns and lack of standardization underlines the need for evidence-based recommendations to guide urologists in choosing appropriate antimicrobial prophylaxis for PB in the context of increasing antibiotic resistance.""","""['Sofie C M Tops', 'Evert L Koldewijn', 'Diederik M Somford', 'Anita M P Huis', 'Eva Kolwijck', 'Heiman F L Wertheim', 'Marlies E J L Hulscher', 'J P Michiel Sedelaar']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Comparison of Single and Prolonged Fluoroquinolone Prophylaxis and Risk Factors for Infectious Complications After Transrectal Prostate Biopsy.', 'Antibiotic prophylaxis prior to transrectal prostate biopsy in Croatia: A national survey.', 'Fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli in intestinal flora of patients undergoing transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy--should we reassess our practices for antibiotic prophylaxis?', 'Comparison of fosfomycin against fluoroquinolones for transrectal prostate biopsy prophylaxis: an individual patient-data meta-analysis.', 'Update on techniques to prevent infections associated with prostate needle biopsy.', ""Infection complications after transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy: A radiology department's experience and strategy for improvement."", 'Comparison of Fluoroquinolones and Other Antibiotic Prophylaxis Regimens for Preventing Complications in Patients Undergoing Transrectal Prostate Biopsy.']"""

This study aims to describe, in an integrated onco-palliative care program (IOPC), patient's profile when first referred to this program, timing of this referral and its impact on the trajectory of care at end-of-life.  Methods:   The IOPC combined the weekly onco-palliative meeting (OPM) dedicated to patients with incurable cancer, and/or the clinical evaluation by the PC team. Oncologists can refer to the multidisciplinary board of the OPM the patients for whom goals and organization of care need to be discussed. We analyzed all patients first referred at OPM in 2011-2013. We defined the index of precocity (IP), as the ratio of the time from first referral to death by the time from diagnosis of incurability to death, ranging from 0 (late referral) to 1 (early referral).  Results:   Of the 416 patients included, 57% presented with lung, urothelial cancers, or sarcoma. At first referral to IOPC, 76% were receiving antitumoral treatment, 63% were outpatients, 56% had a performance status ≤2 and 46% had a serum albumin level > 35 g/l. The median [1st-3rd quartile] IP was 0.39 [0.16-0.72], ranging between 0.53 [0.20-0.79] (earliest referral, i.e. close to diagnosis of incurability, for lung cancer) to 0.16 [0.07-0.56] (latest referral, i.e. close to death relatively to length of metastatic disease, for prostate cancer). Among 367 decedents, 42 (13%) received antitumoral treatment within 14 days before death, and 157 (43%) died in PC units.

Methods:   Men aged ≥70 years (n = 16,534) diagnosed with localized PCa from 1985 to 2014 and managed either with primary observation or ADT in the absence of curative treatment were included. The cases were identified from the population-based Finnish Cancer Registry. We estimated the standardized mortality ratios (SMR) for overall mortality by treatment group. We determined the relative risk (RR) of PCa-specific mortality (PCSM) and other-cause mortality between the two treatment groups. Survival was determined using the life table method. Two age groups (70-79 years and ≥ 80 years) and three calendar time cohorts (1985-1994, 1995-2004, and 2005-2014) were compared following adjustment of propensity score matching between the treatment groups with four covariates (age, year of diagnosis, educational level, and hospital district). Follow-up continued until death or until December 31, 2015.  Results:   Patients in the observation group had lower overall SMRs than those in the ADT group in both age cohorts over the entire study period. PCSM was higher in men aged 70-79 years undergoing primary ADT compared to those managed by observation only (RR: 1.70, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.29-2.23 [1985-1994]; RR 1.55, 95% CI: 1.35-1.84 [1995-2004]; and RR 2.71, 95% CI: 2.08-3.53 [2005-2014]); p = 0.005 for periodic trend.

The aim of the study was to identify clinicopathological factors associated with increased IOP during RARP.  Methods:   We prospectively studied 59 consecutive prostate cancer patients without glaucoma. IOP was measured at 6 predefined time points before, during and after the operation (T1 to T6).  Results:   Compared with T1, IOP decreased after beginning of anesthesia(T2) (by - 6.5 mmHg, p < 0.05), and increased 1 h after induction of pneumoperitoneum in the steep Trendelenburg position (ST) (T3) (+ 7.3 mmHg, p < 0.05). IOP continued to increase until the end of ST (T4) (+ 10.2 mmHg, p < 0.05), and declined when the patient was returned to supine position under general anesthesia (T5) (T1: 20.0 and T5: 20.1 mmHg, p above 0.05). The console time affected the elevation of IOP in ST; IOP elevation during ST was more prominent in men with a console time of ≥4 h (n = 39) than in those with a console time of < 4 h (n = 19) (19.8 ± 6.3 and 15.4 ± 5.8 mmHg, respectively, p < 0.05). Of the 59 patients, 29 had a high baseline IOP (20.0 mmHg or higher), and their IOP elevated during ST was also reduced at T5 (T1: 22.6 and T5: 21.7 mmHg, p above 0.05). There were no postoperative ocular complications.  Conclusions:   Console time of < 4 h is important to prevent extreme elevation of IOP during RARP.

Several computational methods have been developed that formulate the knowledge-based biomarker discovery as a feature selection problem guided by prior information. These methods often require that prior information is encoded as a single score and the algorithms are optimized for biological knowledge of a specific type. However, in practice, domain knowledge from diverse resources can provide complementary information. But no current methods can integrate heterogeneous prior information for biomarker discovery. To address this problem, we developed the Know-GRRF (know-guided regularized random forest) method that enables dynamic incorporation of domain knowledge from multiple disciplines to guide feature selection.  Results:   Know-GRRF embeds domain knowledge in a regularized random forest framework. It combines prior information from multiple domains in a linear model to derive a composite score, which, together with other tuning parameters, controls the regularization of the random forests model. Know-GRRF concurrently optimizes the weight given to each type of domain knowledge and other tuning parameters to minimize the AIC of out-of-bag predictions. The objective is to select a compact feature subset that has a high discriminative power and strong functional relevance to the biological phenotype. Via rigorous simulations, we show that Know-GRRF guided by multiple-domain prior information outperforms feature selection methods guided by single-domain prior information or no prior information. We then applied Known-GRRF to a real-world study to identify prognostic biomarkers of prostate cancers. We evaluated the combination of cancer-related gene annotations, evolutionary conservation and pre-computed statistical scores as the prior knowledge to assemble a panel of biomarkers. We discovered a compact set of biomarkers with significant improvements on prediction accuracies.  Conclusions:   Know-GRRF is a powerful novel method to incorporate knowledge from multiple domains for feature selection. It has a broad range of applications in biomarker discoveries. We implemented this method and released a KnowGRRF package in the R/CRAN archive.""","""['Xin Guan', 'George Runger', 'Li Liu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Bioinformatics""","""['Robust edge-based biomarker discovery improves prediction of breast cancer metastasis.', 'BLASSO: integration of biological knowledge into a regularized linear model.', 'Identification of candidate colon cancer biomarkers by applying a random forest approach on microarray data.', 'Bioinformatics Methods to Select Prognostic Biomarker Genes from Large Scale Datasets: A Review.', 'Application of Biological Domain Knowledge Based Feature Selection on Gene Expression Data.', 'Incorporating knowledge of disease-defining hub genes and regulatory network into a machine learning-based model for predicting treatment response in lupus nephritis after the first renal flare.', 'Transcriptional signatures of the BCL2 family for individualized acute myeloid leukaemia treatment.', 'Towards a safe and efficient clinical implementation of machine learning in radiation oncology by exploring model interpretability, explainability and data-model dependency.', 'Integrative OMICS Data-Driven Procedure Using a Derivatized Meta-Analysis Approach.', 'Biological knowledge-slanted random forest approach for the classification of calcified aortic valve stenosis.']"""

The location of the tumor - the laterality - can be unilateral (the tumor is affecting one side of the prostate), or bilateral on both sides. Nevertheless, the tumor can be overestimated or underestimated by standard screening methods. In this work, a combination of efficient machine learning methods for feature selection and classification are proposed to analyze gene activity and select them as relevant biomarkers for different laterality samples.  Results:   A data set that consists of 450 samples was used in this study. The samples were divided into three laterality classes (left, right, bilateral). The aim of this work is to understand the genomic activity in each class and find relevant genes as indicators for each class with nearly 99% accuracy. The system identified groups of differentially expressed genes (RTN1, HLA-DMB, MRI1) that are able to differentiate samples among the three classes.  Conclusion:   The proposed method was able to detect sets of genes that can identify different laterality classes. The resulting genes are found to be strongly correlated with disease progression.

Materials and Methods: Two hundred twenty-one patients suspected of PCa were enrolled, in which 172 patients of them underwent both SWE and MRI. Elastic value was measured in the area prepared for systematic biopsy and suspicious lesion detected on B-mode or SWE, histopathological result was compared for each biopsy. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy were derived by obtaining optimal threshold from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The correlation between the stiffness of PCa and Gleason scores, prognostic grades, and percentage of cancer in biopsy were evaluated by Spearman rank correlation. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine predictors for diagnosing PCa. The diagnostic capacity of MRI and SWE for detecting PCa and clinically significant PCa in the peripheral zone were assessed by comparing area under curve of ROC curve. Results: A value of 42 kPa was used as the cutoff for differentiating benign from malignant prostatic tissue; the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy were 78.97%, 90.67%, 71.30%, 93.66% and 88.03%, respectively. Rank correlation analysis revealed that the stiffness of PCa had a correlation with Gleason score, prognostic grade, and percentage of cancer in biopsy. On multivariate analysis, the age, free prostate-specific antigen (PSA), PSA density, SWE, and MRI were independent predictors for diagnosing PCa. There was no statistical difference for diagnosing PCa between SWE and MRI (p = 0.259). However, for clinically significant PCa, the diagnostic capacity of SWE was a little higher than MRI (p = 0.013). Conclusions: SWE may provide additional information for PCa detection, which could increase the positive rate of PCa in targeted biopsy and reduce unnecessary biopsy.

Participants with a smoking history ≥30 pack-years and who quit ≤15 years ago, or meeting a lung cancer risk of ≥1.51% via the Prostate Lung Colorectal Ovarian model or ≥2.5% via the Liverpool Lung Project model, were offered LDCT. COPD was defined and classified according to the GOLD (Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease) criteria using prebronchodilator spirometry.

This motivates the need for fast and reliable prostate cancer sensing. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) has gained traction in recent years as a fast non-invasive approach to cancer sensing. The most commonly used DWI sensing modality currently is apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) imaging, with the recently introduced computed high-b value diffusion weighted imaging (CHB-DWI) showing considerable promise for cancer sensing. In this study, we investigate the efficacy of ADC and CHB-DWI sensing modalities when applied to zone-level prostate cancer sensing by introducing several radiomics driven zone-level prostate cancer sensing strategies geared around hand-engineered radiomic sequences from DWI sensing (which we term as Zone-X sensing strategies). Furthermore, we also propose Zone-DR, a discovery radiomics approach based on zone-level deep radiomic sequencer discovery that discover radiomic sequences directly for radiomics driven sensing. Experimental results using 12,466 pathology-verified zones obtained through the different DWI sensing modalities of 101 patients showed that: (i) the introduced Zone-X and Zone-DR radiomics driven sensing strategies significantly outperformed the traditional clinical heuristics driven strategy in terms of AUC, (ii) the introduced Zone-DR and Zone-SVM strategies achieved the highest sensitivity and specificity, respectively for ADC amongst the tested radiomics driven strategies, (iii) the introduced Zone-DR and Zone-LR strategies achieved the highest sensitivities for CHB-DWI amongst the tested radiomics driven strategies, and (iv) the introduced Zone-DR, Zone-LR, and Zone-SVM strategies achieved the highest specificities for CHB-DWI amongst the tested radiomics driven strategies. Furthermore, the results showed that the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity can be optimized based on the particular clinical scenario we wish to employ radiomic driven DWI prostate cancer sensing strategies for, such as clinical screening versus surgical planning. Finally, we investigate the critical regions within sensing data that led to a given radiomic sequence generated by a Zone-DR sequencer using an explainability method to get a deeper understanding on the biomarkers important for zone-level cancer sensing.""","""['Chris Dulhanty', 'Linda Wang', 'Maria Cheng', 'Hayden Gunraj', 'Farzad Khalvati', 'Masoom A Haider', 'Alexander Wong']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Sensors (Basel)""","""['Advanced zoomed diffusion-weighted imaging vs. full-field-of-view diffusion-weighted imaging in prostate cancer detection: a radiomic features study.', 'Automated prostate cancer detection via comprehensive multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging texture feature models.', 'Radiomics assessment of bladder cancer grade using texture features from diffusion-weighted imaging.', 'Computed Diffusion-Weighted Imaging in Prostate Cancer: Basics, Advantages, Cautions, and Future Prospects.', 'Diffusion and quantification of diffusion of prostate cancer.', 'Radiomics in Hypopharyngeal Cancer Management: A State-of-the-Art Review.', 'Artificial Intelligence for Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Radiomics in prostate cancer: an up-to-date review.', 'Current Value of Biparametric Prostate MRI with Machine-Learning or Deep-Learning in the Detection, Grading, and Characterization of Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'MRI Radiomics in Prostate Cancer: A Reliability Study.']"""

Its detection is now possible, thanks to the synergy of high-resolution camera sensors, time-lapse microscopy devices, and dedicated software tools for video and data analysis. In this scenario, we formulated a novel paradigm in which we considered the individual cells as a sort of sensitive element of a sensor, which exploits the camera as a transducer returning the movement of the cell as an output signal. In this way, cell movement allows us to retrieve information about the chemical composition of the close environment. To optimally exploit this information, in this work, we introduce a new setting, in which a cell trajectory is divided into sub-tracks, each one characterized by a specific motion kind. Hence, we considered all the sub-tracks of the single-cell trajectory as the signals of a virtual array of cell motility-based sensors. The kinematics of each sub-track is quantified and used for a classification task. To investigate the potential of the proposed approach, we have compared the achieved performances with those obtained by using a single-trajectory paradigm with the scope to evaluate the chemotherapy treatment effects on prostate cancer cells. Novel pattern recognition algorithms have been applied to the descriptors extracted at a sub-track level by implementing features, as well as samples selection (a good teacher learning approach) for model construction. The experimental results have put in evidence that the performances are higher when a further cluster majority role has been considered, by emulating a sort of sensor fusion procedure. All of these results highlighted the high strength of the proposed approach, and straightforwardly prefigure its use in lab-on-chip or organ-on-chip applications, where the cell motility analysis can be massively applied using time-lapse microscopy images.""","""['Maria Colomba Comes', 'Arianna Mencattini', 'Davide Di Giuseppe', 'Joanna Filippi', ""Michele D'Orazio"", 'Paola Casti', 'Francesca Corsi', 'Lina Ghibelli', 'Corrado Di Natale', 'Eugenio Martinelli']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Sensors (Basel)""","""['Learning Cancer-Related Drug Efficacy Exploiting Consensus in Coordinated Motility Within Cell Clusters.', 'Discovering the hidden messages within cell trajectories using a deep learning approach for in vitro evaluation of cancer drug treatments.', 'In vitro motility evaluation of aggregated cancer cells by means of automatic image processing.', 'Engineering Aspects of Olfaction.', 'A review of image analysis and machine learning techniques for automated cervical cancer screening from pap-smear images.', 'Organ-on-a-Chip systems for new drugs development.', 'Combining microfluidics with machine learning algorithms for RBC classification in rare hereditary hemolytic anemia.', 'Deciphering Cancer Cell Behavior From Motility and Shape Features: Peer Prediction and Dynamic Selection to Support Cancer Diagnosis and Therapy.']"""

A recent report of patients with pT2N0R0 PC found that PNI at prostatectomy was independently associated with higher Gleason score and more diffuse prostatic disease. We aimed to test our hypothesis that PNI on prostate biopsy in pT2N0R0 patients is associated with increased Gleason score upgrading at prostatectomy.  Methods:   We identified 2892 patients status post prostatectomy with pT2N0R0 PC from three institutions, diagnosed between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2014. Multivariable logistic regression (MVA) was used to evaluate the association between prostate biopsy PNI status and surgical Gleason upgrading, while controlling for potential confounders.  Results:   Of the 2892 patients identified, 14% had PNI on biopsy, of whom 21% had surgical Gleason upgrading, while 28% without PNI on biopsy had such upgrading (P < .01). On MVA, the odds ratio (OR) of surgical Gleason upgrading for patients with biopsy PNI relative to patients without biopsy PNI was 0.69 (P < .01). The variables associated with surgical Gleason upgrading were age ≤60 years (OR 1.22, P = .02) and preoperative PSA >4 ng/mL (OR 1.26, P = .02).  Conclusions:   In post-prostatectomy patients with favorable-risk PC, PNI on prostate biopsy was not associated with surgical Gleason score upgrading. This may be due to the association of PNI with more diffuse disease, leading to increased biopsy tumor yield and grading accuracy. These findings suggest that in this setting, biopsy PNI alone should not be a concern for more aggressive disease requiring pathologic confirmation or intervention. This may help guide treatment decision-making for men debating active surveillance, radiation, and surgery.""","""['Andrew R Barsky', 'Ryan D Kraus', 'Ruben Carmona', 'Patricia M G Santos', 'Carrie Li', 'Lauren E Schwartz', 'Leslie K Ballas', 'Neha Vapiwala']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Relationship and significance of greatest percentage of tumor and perineural invasion on needle biopsy in prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Evidence of perineural invasion on prostate biopsy specimen and survival after radical prostatectomy.', 'Risk of Pathologic Upgrading or Locally Advanced Disease in Early Prostate Cancer Patients Based on Biopsy Gleason Score and PSA: A Population-Based Study of Modern Patients.', 'Current perspectives on Gleason grading of prostate cancer.', 'Is Grade Group 1 (Gleason score 3\u200a+\u200a3\u200a=\u200a6) adenocarcinoma of the prostate really cancer?', 'The GAL/GALR2 axis promotes the perineural invasion of salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma via epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.', 'Clinicopathological factors associated with pathological upgrading from biopsy to prostatectomy in patients with ISUP grade group ≤2 prostate cancer.', 'Interobserver reproducibility of perineural invasion of prostatic adenocarcinoma in needle biopsies.']"""

We speculated that the intermittent addition of dexamethasone may also enhance the antitumor effect of radioligand therapy (RLT) with 177 Lu-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-617.  Patients and methods:   Seventy-one patients with mCRPC were treated with 1 to 5 cycles of 177 Lu-PSMA-617 (6.0-7.4 GBq per cycle) at 6 to 8 weeks intervals. Based on the clinical decision (eg, in the case of vertebral metastases), 56% of patients received 4 mg of dexamethasone for the first 5 days of each cycle. Biochemical response rates, PSA decline and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed after one, three, and five cycles of RLT.  Results:   PSA response rates were not significantly different between patients receiving 177 Lu-PSMA-617 plus dexamethasone and those receiving 177 Lu-PSMA-617 alone after one, three, and five cycles (33% vs 39%, P = .62; 45% vs 45%, P = 1.0; and 38% vs 42%, P = .81). However, there was a nonsignificant trend for a more pronounced PSA decline in patients with bone metastases receiving adjunct dexamethasone (-21% ± 50% vs +11% ± 90%, P = .08; -21% ± 69% vs +22% ± 116%, P = .07; -13% ± 76% vs +32% ± 119%, P = .07). Median PFS tended to be longer in patients with bone metastases receiving 177 Lu-PSMA-617 plus dexamethasone (146 vs 81 days; hazard ratio: 0.87 [95% confidence interval: 0.47-1.61]; P = .20). Multiple regression analysis showed that age (P = .0110), alkaline phosphatase levels (P = .0380) and adjunct dexamethasone (P = .0285) were independent predictors of changes in PSA in patients with bone metastases.  Conclusions:   We observed high response rates to 177 Lu-PSMA-617 RLT in men with mCRPC. The short-term addition of dexamethasone to 177 Lu-PSMA-617 had no striking antitumor effect but might enhance biochemical responses in patients with bone metastases.

However, post-implantation exercise may alter the tumour microenvironment to make it more vulnerable to treatment by increasing tumour perfusion while reducing hypoxia. This has been shown most convincingly in breast and prostate cancer models to date and it is unclear whether other tumour types respond in a similar way. We aimed to determine whether tumour perfusion and hypoxia are altered with exercise in a melanoma model, and compared this with a breast cancer model. We hypothesised that post-implantation exercise would reduce tumour hypoxia and increase perfusion in these two models. Female, 6-10 week old C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with EO771 breast or B16-F10 melanoma tumour cells before randomisation to either exercise or non-exercising control. Exercising mice received a running wheel with a revolution counter. Mice were euthanised when tumours reached maximum ethical size and the tumours assessed for perfusion, hypoxia, blood vessel density and proliferation. We saw an increase in heart to body weight ratio in exercising compared with non-exercising mice (p = 0.0008), indicating that physiological changes occurred with this form of physical activity. However, exercise did not affect vascularity, perfusion, hypoxia or tumour growth rate in either tumour type. In addition, EO771 tumours had a more aggressive phenotype than B16-F10 tumours, as inferred from a higher rate of proliferation (p<0.0001), a higher level of tumour hypoxia (p = 0.0063) and a higher number of CD31+ vessels (p = 0.0005). Our results show that although a physiological training effect was seen with exercise, it did not affect tumour hypoxia, perfusion or growth rate.

At the same time, IC50 values post BTX-A treatment were 7.2 and 6.4 U/mL for HCT116 and DU145 cells, respectively without any toxicity to vero cells. Both drugs showed inhibitory potentials on cellular proliferation and the ability of cancer cells to migrate in scratched monolayers was obviously inhibited along with increasing their concentrations. P53 expression levels in captopril and BTX-A treated DU145 cells were elevated by 4 and 2.5 folds, respectively, while lower level of apoptosis induction in HCT116 cells was observed.

Previous studies have shown that LETM1 expression is increased in several types of human cancer and is associated with a poor clinical outcome. However, the role of LETM1 in prostate cancer (PCa) has not yet been determined. In this study, we investigated the clinicopathological significance of LETM1 expression and its role in PCa progression.  Methods:   We assessed the expression of LETM1 and genes related to cancer stemness, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell cycle, and PI3K/Akt signaling in 133 paraffin-embedded PCa tissue samples and cancer cells by using immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and Western blotting.  Results:   LETM1 expression was significantly increased in PCa, and it was positively correlated with Gleason score, pathologic tumor (pT) stage, clinical stage, and high microvessel density. Survival analysis showed that patients with PCa with a high level of LETM1 expression exhibited a low overall survival. Cox regression analysis indicated that LETM1 is an independent poor prognostic PCa factor. Additionally, the expression of LETM1 was correlated with cancer cell stemness-associated genes, EMT-related genes, cell cycle regulatory genes, and PI3K/Akt signaling gene expression in PCa. Furthermore, knocking down LETM1 expression down-regulated the expression of stemness-related proteins, while inhibiting tumor spheroid formation, EMT-like changes, cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in PCa cells. Importantly, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 strongly inhibited the expression of LETM1, pPI3K-p85, and pAkt (Thr308, Ser473) in PCa cells.  Conclusion:   These results indicate that LETM1 expression is associated with cancer cell stemness, promotes EMT-like changes and cell proliferation and is a potential prognostic biomarker for PCa.""","""['Lihua Piao', 'Haoyue Li', 'Ying Feng', 'Xiaogang Li', 'Yan Cui', 'Yanhua Xuan']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Manag Res""","""['LETM1: A Single Entity With Diverse Impact on Mitochondrial Metabolism and Cellular Signaling.', 'LETM1 is a potential biomarker that predicts poor prognosis in gastric adenocarcinoma.', 'LETM1 is a potential cancer stem-like cell marker and predicts poor prognosis in colorectal adenocarcinoma.', 'LETM1 is a potential biomarker of prognosis in lung non-small cell carcinoma.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Leucine Zipper EF-Hand Containing Transmembrane Protein-1 Function in Health and Disease.', 'A LETM2-Regulated PI3K-Akt Signaling Axis Reveals a Prognostic and Therapeutic Target in Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Mitochondrial calcium exchange in physiology and disease.', 'Picroside II Improves Severe Acute Pancreatitis-Induced Hepatocellular Injury in Rats by Affecting JAK2/STAT3 Phosphorylation Signaling.', 'LETM1: A Single Entity With Diverse Impact on Mitochondrial Metabolism and Cellular Signaling.']"""

Enzalutamide (MDV3100) is a second-generation antiandrogenic drug that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2012 to treat patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, emergence of resistance against this drug is inevitable, and it has been a major challenge to develop interventions that help manage enzalutamide-resistant CRPC. Erythropoietin-producing human hepatocellular (Eph) receptors are targeted by ephrin protein ligands and have a broad range of functions. Increasing evidence indicates that this signaling pathway plays an important role in tumorigenesis. Overexpression of EPH receptor B4 (EPHB4) has been observed in multiple types of cancer, being closely associated with proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of tumors. Here, using RNA-Seq analyses of clinical and preclinical samples, along with several biochemical and molecular methods, we report that enzalutamide-resistant PCa requires an active EPHB4 pathway that supports drug resistance of this tumor type. Using a small kinase inhibitor and RNAi-based gene silencing to disrupt EPHB4 activity, we found that these disruptions re-sensitize enzalutamide-resistant PCa to the drug both in vitro and in vivo Mechanistically, we found that EPHB4 stimulates the AR by inducing proto-oncogene c-Myc (c-Myc) expression. Taken together, these results provide critical insight into the mechanism of enzalutamide resistance in PCa, potentially offering a therapeutic avenue for enhancing the efficacy of enzalutamide to better manage this common malignancy.""","""['Chaohao Li', 'Nadia A Lanman', 'Yifan Kong', 'Daheng He', 'Fengyi Mao', 'Elia Farah', 'Yanquan Zhang', 'Jinghui Liu', 'Chi Wang', 'Qiou Wei', 'Xiaoqi Liu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Inhibition of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Inhibition of noncanonical Wnt pathway overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).', 'Understanding and overcoming the mechanisms of primary and acquired resistance to abiraterone and enzalutamide in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Drug Resistance of Enzalutamide in CRPC.', 'GSTM2 is a key molecular determinant of resistance to SG-ARIs.', 'Mechanisms of Resistance to Second-Generation Antiandrogen Therapy for Prostate Cancer: Actual Knowledge and Perspectives.', 'Diptoindonesin G antagonizes AR signaling and enhances the efficacy of antiandrogen therapy in prostate cancer.', 'The Pyrazolo3,4-dpyrimidine-Based Kinase Inhibitor NVP-BHG712: Effects of Regioisomers on Tumor Growth, Perfusion, and Hypoxia in EphB4-Positive A375 Melanoma Xenografts.']"""

However, clinical benefit against solid tumors remains to be shown. We made a bispecific antibody that targets both the common prostate tumor-specific antigen PSMA and CD3 (PMSAxCD3) and provide evidence for tumor inhibition in several preclinical solid tumor models. Mice expressing the human extracellular regions of CD3 and PSMA were generated to examine antitumor efficacy in the presence of an intact immune system and PSMA expression in normal tissues. PSMAxCD3 accumulated in PSMA-expressing tissues and tumors as detected by immuno-PET imaging. Although PSMAxCD3 induced T-cell activation and showed antitumor efficacy in mice with low tumor burden, PSMAxCD3 lost efficacy against larger solid tumors, mirroring the difficulty of treating solid tumors in the clinic. Costimulatory receptors can enhance T-cell responses. We show here that costimulation can enhance the antitumor efficacy of PSMAxCD3. In particular, 4-1BB stimulation in combination with PSMAxCD3 enhanced T-cell activation and proliferation, boosted efficacy against larger tumors, and induced T-cell memory, leading to durable antitumor responses.

Our objective was to calculate the mean overall costs per patient of cancer-related medications and radiation, as well as by disease subtype and stage, in the first year after diagnosis for the 4 most prevalent cancers in Ontario.  Methods:   We conducted a retrospective cohort study using provincial health administrative databases to identify population health system resources and costs for all patients diagnosed with breast, colorectal, lung or prostate cancer between Jan. 1, 2010, and Dec. 31, 2015 in Ontario. The primary outcome measure was the overall average cost per patient in the 365 days after diagnosis for cancer-related medications and radiation treatment, calculated with the use of 2 novel costing algorithms. We determined the cost by disease, disease subtype and stage as secondary outcomes.  Results:   There were 168 316 Ontarians diagnosed with cancer during the study period, 50 141 with breast cancer, 38 108 with colorectal cancer, 34 809 with lung cancer and 45 258 with prostate cancer. The mean per-patient cost for cancer-related medications was $8167 (95% confidence interval [CI] $8023-$8311), $6568 (95% CI $6446-$6691), $2900 (95% CI $2816-$2984) and $1211 (95% CI $1175-$1247) for breast, colorectal, lung and prostate cancer, respectively. The corresponding mean radiation treatment costs were $18 529 (95% CI $18 415-$18 643), $15 177 (95% CI $14 899-$15 456), $10 818 (95% CI $10 669-$10 966) and $16 887 (95% CI $16 648-$17 125). In general, stage III and IV cancers were the most expensive stages for both medications and radiation across all 4 disease sites.

Methods:   In this study, we developed an adaptive cytokine-induced killer cell (CIK)-based immunotherapeutic application targeting the prostate cancer stem-like cells (PCSCs). In this therapeutic platform, dendritic cells (DC) were isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and preloaded or sensitized with immunogenic peptides derived from two PCSC-associated cell membrane molecules, CD44 and EpCAM, followed by co-culture with the expanded peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL)-derived CIK cells. The in vitro cytotoxic activity of DC-activated CIK cells against PCSCs was determined by CCK8 and TUNEL assays, and the in vivo anti-tumor effect of DC-activated CIK cells on prostate cancer xenograft tumors was evaluated in subcutaneous and orthotopic xenograft models.  Results:   Our results showed that the peptide-sensitized DC-CIK cell preparation manifested significant in vitro cytotoxic activity against the PCSC-enriched prostatospheroids and also in vivo anti-tumor effect against prostate cancer xenografts derived from the PCSC-enriched prostatospheroids.

Prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been widely employed for early diagnosis of prostate cancer and recommending a treatment plan. The incidence of rectal perforation during endorectal prostate MRI is rare and has never been reported before. Herein, we present a case of rectal perforation after a prostate MRI examination that was subjected to emergency surgical intervention because of the acute presentation of generalized peritonitis. Patients with systemic comorbidities are reportedly at greater risks of encountering colonoscopic perforation. Endorectal prostate MRI is a safe diagnostic modality, but inadequate lubrication of the endorectal coil or over-insufflation of the balloon during the procedure may also lead to serious complications such as hollow organ perforation. Early surgery will be necessary should peritoneal symptoms persist.  Case presentation:   In 2015, a 56-year-old man came to our ER due to acute abdominal pain after he finished his MRI exam. The exam indicated diffuse tenderness over his abdomen and at the ER, his abdominal CT (computerized tomography) was checked. The images revealed extraluminal air in the perirectal fat and the pneumoperitoneum. In response, exploratory laparotomy, simple closure of rectal perforation, and loop-S colostomy were performed and the patient was discharged 1 month after operation.  Conclusions:   Prostate MRI is a secure procedure with few complications. Clinicians must keep in mind the possibility of perforation when using ultrasound probe. Hollow organ perforation can result in serious morbidity or death. As a result, patients need to be informed of the complications of prostate MRI. When performing the procedure, clinicians must be cautioned about the potential problems for patients with high-anesthetic risk.""","""['I Hsu', 'Chia-Chen Lee', 'Ming-Jenn Chen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Rectal injury during permanent seed implantation for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Total laparoscopic repair of sigmoid foreign body perforation.', 'Bilateral tension pneumothoraces and subcutaneous emphysema following colonoscopic polypectomy: a case report and discussion of anesthesia considerations.', 'Spontaneous perforation of the rectum with possible stercoral etiology: report of a case and review of the literature.', 'Magnetic resonance tomography with endorectal coil for examination of prostate and seminal vesicles.']"""

Prior to analysis of gene expression, the RNA-Seq data has to be processed through a number of steps resulting in a quantification of expression of each gene/transcript in each of the analyzed samples. A number of workflows are available to help researchers perform these steps on their own data, or on public data to take advantage of novel software or reference data in data re-analysis. However, many of the existing workflows are limited to specific types of studies. We therefore aimed to develop a maximally general workflow, applicable to a wide range of data and analysis approaches and at the same time support research on both model and non-model organisms. Furthermore, we aimed to make the workflow usable also for users with limited programming skills.  Results:   Utilizing the workflow management system Snakemake and the package management system Conda, we have developed a modular, flexible and user-friendly RNA-Seq analysis workflow: RNA-Seq Analysis Snakemake Workflow (RASflow). Utilizing Snakemake and Conda alleviates challenges with library dependencies and version conflicts and also supports reproducibility. To be applicable for a wide variety of applications, RASflow supports the mapping of reads to both genomic and transcriptomic assemblies. RASflow has a broad range of potential users: it can be applied by researchers interested in any organism and since it requires no programming skills, it can be used by researchers with different backgrounds.

Materials and Methods: Genotyping was performed in 237 PC cases and in 236 age-matched controls by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for deletion of GST polymorphisms and by quantitative PCR for SNPs. Results: We found that carriers of either GSTP1*Val (rs1138272) or GSTP1*Val (rs1695) variant alleles had a PC risk compared to individuals with both referent alleles (OR = 4.93, 95%CI: 2.89-8.40, p < 0.001 and OR = 1.8, 95%CI: 1.19-2.73, p = 0.006, respectively). Additionally, in a haplotype analysis we found that individuals with GSTP1*C haplotype, represented by both variant alleles (GSTP1*Val rs1695 + GSTP1*Val rs1138272), had a 5.46 times higher risk of PC development compared to individuals with the most frequent haplotype (95%CI = 2.56-11.65, p < 0.001), suggesting a potential role of those variants in PC susceptibility. A regression analysis on the number of risk-associated alleles per individual (GSTM1*active, GSTT1*null, GSTP1*Val rs1695 and GSTP1*Val rs1138272) showed a significant increase in the risk of developing PC, from 3.65-fold in carriers of two risk alleles (95%CI = 1.55-8.61, p = 0.003) to an approximately 12-fold increase in carriers of all four risk alleles (95%CI = 3.05-44.93, p < 0.001).

Systemic effects of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) have been observed but the influence of ADT on renal calculi in prostate cancer (PCa) patients is not fully understood. We conducted this population-based study to evaluate the impact of ADT on the subsequent risk of renal calculi. We used the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan to analyze the incidences of renal calculi in ADT patients and non-ADT patients from 2001 to 2013. In total, 3309 patients with PCa were selected. After matching with 1:1 propensity-score analysis, 758 ADT patients with 758 matched non-ADT controls were enrolled in the final analysis. Demographic characteristics were analyzed and Cox regression analysis for calculating the hazard ratios (HR) was performed for the subsequent risk of renal calculi. Finally, 186 (186/1516, 12.3%) patients with diagnosed renal calculi were detected. ADT patients had a lower risk of subsequent renal calculi with an adjusted HR of 0.38 (7% vs. 17.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28-0.53; p < 0.001) in comparison with the non-ADT group.

'In-air' as well as in-vivo portal EPID images can be used as input. The method was validated using data from treatments of 5 patients (2 rectal, 2 prostate cancer and one oligo metastasis). 3D pre-treatment verification of the reference plan using 'in-air' EPID images was performed and compared against measured (with the Octavius 4D system) and planned (in the planning CT) dose distributions. In-vivo EPID dose distributions were compared to the TPS for the first three adaptations of all treatments. For all comparisons, dose difference values at the reference point and γ-parameters were reported.

Great variability in the performance of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has been reported for prediction of EPE. The present study aimed to determine the diagnostic performance of mpMRI for predicting EPE in different National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk categories.  Methods:   Overall 664 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy with a staging mpMRI were enrolled in this single-center, retrospective study. Patients with mpMRI report non-compliant with PI-RADSv2.0, were excluded. Patients were stratified according to NCCN criteria: very low/low (VLR-LR) to High Risk (HR) in order to assess final pathology EPE rates (focal and established). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of staging mpMRI were computed in each group. Univariable and multivariable analysis were used to evaluate predictors of positive surgical margins.  Results:   Pathological evaluation demonstrated established and focal EPE in 60 (9%) and 106 (16%) patients, respectively, while mpMRI suspicion for EPE was present in 180 (27%) patients. Age, preoperative PSA, PSA density, number of positive cores, NCCN groups, prostate volume, mpMRI suspicion for EPE, PIRADSv2.0 and lesion size differed significantly between the patients with any EPE and without EPE (all P≤0.05). The sensitivity of mpMRI in detecting any EPE varied from 12% (95% CI: 0.6-53%) in VLR-LR to 83% (66-93%) in HR while the corresponding values for the specificity were 92% (85-96%) and 63% (45-78%), respectively. Patients with false-negative mpMRI EPE prediction were more likely to have positive surgical margins in univariable (OR: 2.14; CI: 1.18, 3.87) as well as multivariable analysis adjusting for NCCN risk categories (OR: 1.97; CI: 1.08, 3.60).  Conclusions:   The performance of mpMRI for prediction of EPE varies greatly between different NCCN risk categories with a low positive predicting value in patients at low to favorable intermediate risk and a low negative predictive value in patients at Unfavorable intermediate to high risk PCa. Given that mpMRI EPE misdiagnosis could have a negative impact on oncological and functional outcomes, NCCN risk categories should be considered when interpreting mpMRI findings in PCa patients.""","""['Ugo G Falagario', 'Ivan Jambor', 'Parita Ratnani', 'Alberto Martini', 'Patrick-Julien Treacy', 'Ethan Wajswol', 'Anna Lantz', 'George Papastefanou', 'Rachel Weil', 'Deron Phillip', 'Sara Lewis', 'Kenneth Haines', 'Luigi Cormio', 'Giuseppe Carrieri', 'Natasha Kyprianou', 'Peter Wiklund', 'Ashutosh K Tewari']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Minerva Urol Nefrol""","""['Combined Clinical Parameters and Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for the Prediction of Extraprostatic Disease-A Risk Model for Patient-tailored Risk Stratification When Planning Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Combining prostate health index and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging may better predict extraprostatic extension after radical prostatectomy.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic-Resonance to Confirm Eligibility to an Active Surveillance Program for Low-Risk Prostate Cancer: Intermediate Time Results of a Third Referral High Volume Centre Active Surveillance Protocol.', 'Risk of adverse pathology at prostatectomy in the era of MRI and targeted biopsies; rethinking active surveillance for intermediate risk prostate cancer patients.', 'Extraprostatic extension in prostate cancer: primer for radiologists.', 'Oncological outcomes of whole-gland cryoablation in patients with prostate cancer and high risk of lymph node invasion.', 'The progress of dorsal vascular complex control strategy in radical prostatectomy.', 'A Matched-Pair Analysis after Robotic and Retropubic Radical Prostatectomy: A New Definition of Continence and the Impact of Different Surgical Techniques.', 'Analysis of Apparent Diffusion Coefficient Value and Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging Parameters of Prostate Cancer Patients after Diagnosis and Treatment with Magnetic Resonance Imaging.', 'Computational Detection of Extraprostatic Extension of Prostate Cancer on Multiparametric MRI Using Deep Learning.']"""

Methods: Line phantoms and mice bearing 223Ra were imaged using a dedicated small animal SPECT by detecting the low-energy photon emissions from 223Ra. Localization of the therapeutic agent was verified by whole-body and whole-limb autoradiography and its radiobiological effect confirmed by immunofluorescence. Results: A state-of-the-art commercial small animal SPECT system equipped with a highly sensitive collimator enables collection of sufficient counts for three-dimensional reconstruction at reasonable administered activities and acquisition times. Line sources of 223Ra in both air and in a water scattering phantom gave a line spread function with a full-width-at-half-maximum of 1.45 mm.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to play essential roles in the progression of cancers, including Pca. LncRNA colorectal neoplasia differentially expressed (CRNDE) has been found to affect tumorigenesis in many cancers. However, the exact role and mechanism of CRNDE in Pca remain poorly understood. 64 Pca patients were recruited in this study. PC3 and 22RV1 cells were used in vitro experiments. The expressions of CRNDE, microRNA-101 (miR-101), and Ras-related protein 1A (Rap1A) were detected in vivo and in vitro by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot, respectively. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were investigated through cell counting kit-8, flow cytometry, and Transwell assays, respectively. The interaction between miR-101 and CRNDE or Rap1A was explored by bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay. High expression of CRNDE was shown in Pca tissues and cells and predicted poor outcomes of patients. Overexpression of CRNDE promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion but decreased apoptosis in Pca cells, while its knockdown showed an opposite effect. CRNDE was a decoy of miR-101 and its effect on Pca progression was reversed by miR-101. Rap1A was identified as a target of miR-101 and it attenuated the effect of miR-101 on Pca development. Moreover, the Rap1A protein level was positively regulated by CRNDE, which was weakened by miR-101. CRNDE contributed to cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by regulating the miR-101/Rap1A axis in Pca, providing a novel strategy for Pca treatment.""","""['J H Chen', 'W Tong', 'X F Pu', 'J Z Wang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Neoplasma""","""['Long non-coding RNA CRNDE regulates the growth and migration of prostate cancer cells by targeting microRNA-146a-5p.', 'MiR-203 down-regulates Rap1A and suppresses cell proliferation, adhesion and invasion in prostate cancer.', 'Long noncoding RNA CRNDE promotes non-small cell lung cancer progression via sponging microRNA-338-3p.', 'Contribution of CRNDE lncRNA in the development of cancer and the underlying mechanisms.', 'CRNDE: An important oncogenic long non-coding RNA in human cancers.', 'MiR-101: An Important Regulator of Gene Expression and Tumor Ecosystem.', 'CRNDE: A valuable long noncoding RNA for diagnosis and therapy of solid and hematological malignancies.', 'Crosstalk between Long Non Coding RNAs, microRNAs and DNA Damage Repair in Prostate Cancer: New Therapeutic Opportunities?', 'Regulation of Neuroendocrine-like Differentiation in Prostate Cancer by Non-Coding RNAs.', 'Long non-coding RNA CRNDE regulates the growth and migration of prostate cancer cells by targeting microRNA-146a-5p.']"""

Field strength/sequence:   3.0T/T2 -weighted (T2 W), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) sequences.  Assessment:   PI-RADSv2 score for each tumor was recorded. Radiomic features were extracted from T2 W, ADC, and DCE sequences and Mutual Information Maximization criterion was used to identify the optimal features on each sequence. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to develop predictive models and a radiomics nomogram and their performance was evaluated.  Statistical tests:   Student's t or chi-square were used to assess the differences in clinicopathologic data between the training and validation cohorts. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated.  Results:   In PI-RADSv2 assessment, 67 lesions scored 5, 70 lesions scored 4, and 29 lesions scored 3. For each sequence, 4404 features were extracted and the top 20 best features were selected. The radiomics model incorporating signatures from the three sequences achieved better performance than any single sequence (AUC: radiomics model 0.868, T2 W 0.700, ADC 0.759, DCE 0.726).

Of the 68 patients with a positive 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT, 44 (65%) showed abnormal uptake only in the pelvic area, seven (10%) only outside the pelvic area, and 17 (25%) both within and outside the pelvic area. 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT-positive pelvic lymph nodes were often (84%) detected on the same side as the lymph node metastasis diagnosed at ePLND. Based on the outcomes of the 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT, change of management was noted in 68% of the patients.  Conclusion:   Recurrence of PCa on 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT was limited to the pelvis in the majority of patients with BCR after RP with pN1 ePLND. Moreover, recurrence was often detected on the same side as the lymph node metastasis at ePLND. The results confirm the diagnostic value of 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT in patients with BCR after RP with pN1 ePLND. Prospective studies are needed to support the long-term benefit of 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT-dictated management changes.""","""['Thijs H Huits', 'Henk B Luiting', 'Henk G van der Poel', 'Rohan Nandurkar', 'Maarten Donswijk', 'Eva Schaake', 'Wouter Vogel', 'Monique J Roobol', 'Esther Wit', 'Phillip Stricker', 'Louise Emmett', 'Pim J van Leeuwen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'Histological comparison between predictive value of preoperative 3-T multiparametric MRI and 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan for pathological outcomes at radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection for prostate cancer.', 'How accurate is 68Gallium-prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography / computed tomography (68Ga-PSMA PET/CT) on primary lymph node staging before radical prostatectomy in intermediate and high risk prostate cancer?

The main goal was to obtain robust and high-quality plans for different anatomic sites and various dosimetric requirements.  Methods:   Monaco (Elekta, St. Louis, US) was the TPS in this work. All input parameters for inverse planning could be defined in a plan template inside Monaco. A software tool called Robot Framework was used to launch auto-planning trials with updated plan templates. The template modifier external to Monaco was the major component of our auto-planning platform. For current implementation, it was a rule-based system that mimics the trial-and-error process of an experienced planner. A template was automatically updated by changing the optimization constraints based on dosimetric evaluation of the plan obtained in the previous trial, along with the data of the iterative optimization extracted from Monaco. Treatment plans generated by Monaco with all plan evaluation criteria satisfied were considered acceptable, and such plans would be saved for further evaluation by clinicians. The auto-planning platform was validated for 10 prostate and 10 head-and-neck cases in comparison with clinical plans generated by experienced planners.  Results:   The performance and robustness of our auto-planning platform was tested with clinical cases of prostate and head and neck treatment. For prostate cases, automatically generated plans had very similar plan quality with the clinical plans, and the bladder volume receiving 62.5 Gy, 50 Gy, and 40 Gy in auto-plans was reduced by 1%, 3%, and 5%, respectively. For head and neck cases, auto-plans had better conformity with reduced dose to the normal structures but slightly higher dose inhomogeneity in the target volume. Remarkably, the maximum dose in the spinal cord and brain stem was reduced by more than 3.5 Gy in auto-plans. Fluence map optimization only with less than 30 trials was adequate to generate acceptable plans, and subsequent optimization for final plans was completed by Monaco without further intervention. The plan quality was weakly dependent on the parameter selection in the initial template and the choices of the step sizes for changing the constraint values.  Conclusion:   An automated planning platform to interface with Monaco was developed, and our reported tests showed preliminary results for prostate and head and neck cases.""","""['Xiaotian Huang', 'Hong Quan', 'Bo Zhao', 'Wing Zhou', 'Charles Chen', 'Yan Chen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Efficiency of biological versus physical optimization for single-arc VMAT for prostate and head and neck cases.', 'Automated volumetric modulated arc therapy planning for whole pelvic prostate radiotherapy.', 'Can the Student Outperform the Master?

Methods:   Participants were drawn from the New South Wales (NSW) Prostate Cancer Care and Outcomes Study. Eligible men were diagnosed with PC between 2000 and 2002, aged less than 70 years at diagnosis, and completed a 15-year follow-up survey. Demographic and clinical data were collected at baseline.

Mean age was 75.8 (range 59-84) with a mean follow-up time of 15.2 years post-diagnosis. Over a third of men (37.4%) reported at least one unmet need at 15 years. Most frequently reported unmet needs pertained to the comprehensive cancer care (34.1%) domain. 87.2% of participants who reported problems with sexual function reported this need as moderate/severe.

Therefore, we developed a prognostic risk classification for biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS) for patients after PSMA-PET-guided MDT after radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   We analyzed 292 patients with local recurrence (LR) and/or pelvic lymph node (LN) lesions and/or up to five distant LN, bone (BM), or visceral metastases (VM) detected with [68Ga]PSMA-PET imaging. Median follow-up was 16 months (range 0-57). The primary endpoint was bRFS after MDT. Cox regression analysis for risk factors was incorporated into a recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) with classification and regression tree method.  Results:   PSA at recurrence ≥ 0.8 ng/mL, BM, and VM was significantly associated with biochemical relapse. RPA showed five groups with tenfold cross-validation of 0.294 (SE 0.032). After building risk classes I to IV (p < 0.0001), mean bRFS was 36.3 months (95% CI 32.4-40.1) in class I (PSA < 0.8 ng/mL, no BM) and 25.8 months (95% CI 22.5-29.1) in class II (PSA ≥ 0.8 ng/mL, no BM, no VM). LR and/or pelvic LNs caused relapse in classes I and II. Mean bRFS was 16.0 months (95% CI 12.4-19.6) in class III (PSA irrelevant, present BM) and 5.7 months (95% CI 2.7-8.7) in class IV (PSA ≥ 0.8 ng/mL, no BM, present VM).  Conclusion:   We developed and internally validated a risk classification for bRFS after PSMA-PET-guided MDT. Patients with PSA < 0.8 ng/mL and local relapse only (LR and/or pelvic LNs) had the most promising bRFS. PSA ≥ 0.8 ng/mL and local relapse only (LR and/or pelvic LNs) indicated intermediate risk for failure. Patients with BM were at higher risk regardless of the PSA. However, those patients still show satisfactory bRFS. In patients with VM, bRFS is heavily decreased.

However, previous studies have been limited variably by failure to adjust for cancer-specific risk factors (e.g., body mass index), inattention to diabetes duration and use of antidiabetic medications, and failure to stratify by obesity.  Methods:   We examined the association between diabetes, HbA1c, and cancer risk in the UK Biobank, using data from 476,517 participants (54% women), followed for an average period of 7.1 years. Diabetes was defined on the basis of baseline self-reported diagnosis of diabetes and/or use of diabetes medication, while HbA1c measured at baseline was categorized as low (<31 mmol/mol), normal (31-<39 mmol/mol), increased risk (39-<48 mmol/mol), and high risk for diabetes (≥48 mmol/mol). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the association of diabetes and cancer at different anatomical sites, with adjustment for cancer-specific risk factors.  Results:   Diabetes was associated with increased risk of cancers of the stomach, liver, bladder, endometrium, and lung among smokers, and with decreased risk of prostate cancer. Compared with the normal HbA1c category, the increased risk category was positively associated with risk of cancers of the colon, liver, bladder, and lung among smokers, and the high-risk category was associated with increased risk of cancers of the esophagus, liver, pancreas, and bladder, and with decreased risk of prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   These results suggest that both diabetes and/or elevated HbA1c are associated with risk of cancer at several anatomic sites.

One of the family members of PLA2, secretory Phospholipase A2 Group IIA (PLA2G2A), was associated with different types of malignancies including prostate cancer. Elevated serum levels of PLA2G2A was found in prostate cancer (PCa) patients and associated with increased tumor grade in literature. 5'UTR regions have regulatory role in protein expression by controlling the accessibility of factors necessary for the translation initiation. Single nucleotide polymorphisms at 5'UTR regions have the potential to affect mRNA translation efficiency resulting in altered protein levels depending on structure and nucleotide content. Given that the 5'UTR polymorphism in PLA2G2A gene (rs11573156) is associated with increased serum levels of PLA2G2A, the association of this 5'UTR polymorphism with PCa susceptibility and metastasis was investigated in this study. Total of 261 PCa patients and 128 control individuals were genotyped with polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).

Aim:   We sought to identify the prevalence and predictors of climacturia and associated patient/partner bother in patients with and without prior PCa treatment.  Methods:   We analyzed a database of patients who presented to our Men's Health clinic and filled out a questionnaire related to sexual function and pertinent medical histories. The prevalence of climacturia and associated patient/partner bother in patients with/without prior RP/RT was calculated. Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions were performed to identify predictors associated with climacturia and patient/partner bother.  Outcomes:   The primary outcomes were the prevalence and predictors of climacturia and associated patient/partner bother in patients with/without history of definitive PCa treatment.  Results:   Among 1,117 patients able to achieve orgasm, 192 patients (17%) had prior history of definitive therapy for PCa (RP alone = 139 [72%]; RT alone = 22 [11%]; RP + RT = 31 [16%]). Climacturia was reported by 39%, 14%, 52%, and 2.4% of patients with history of RP alone, RT alone, RP + RT, and neither RP nor RT, respectively (P < .05 between all groups). 33 to 45 percent of patients with climacturia noted significant patient/partner bother. Factors significantly associated with climacturia were prior RP, prior RT, history of other prostate surgery, and erectile dysfunction, although erectile dysfunction was not significant on multivariable analysis. Significant reduction in climacturia prevalence was noted for patients who were ≥1 year out from RP, compared with patients who were <1 year out. Among patients with prior RP/RT, stress urinary incontinence was associated with increased risk of climacturia, whereas diabetes was associated with decreased risk. No factors were associated with patient/partner bother. Among patients with prior RP, nerve-sparing technique did not predict presence of climacturia but was associated with reduced patient/partner bother.  Clinical translation:   Given significant prevalence of climacturia and associated patient/partner bother, patients should be counseled on the risk of climacturia before undergoing RP/RT.  Strengths and limitations:   Strengths include the large study population and the focus on both RP and RT. Limitations include the facts that this is a single-institution study that primarily relies on patients' subjective reporting and that the study population may not represent the general population.

Materials and Methods: Within the National Inpatient Sample database (2008-2015), we identified all MIRP patients and patients who underwent open conversion at MIRP. First, estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) tested temporal trends of open conversion. Second, multivariable logistic regression models predicted open conversion at MIRP. All models were weighted and adjusted for clustering, as well as all available patient and hospital characteristics. Results: Of 57,078 MIRP patients, 368 (0.6%) underwent open conversion. The rates of open conversion decreased over time (from 1.80% to 0.38%; EAPC: -26.0%; p = 0.003). In multivariable logistic regression models predicting open conversion, patient obesity (odds ratio [OR]: 2.10; p < 0.001), frailty (OR: 1.45; p = 0.005), and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) ≥2 (OR: 1.57; p = 0.03) achieved independent predictor status. Moreover, compared with high-volume hospitals, medium-volume (OR: 2.03; p < 0.001) and low-volume hospitals (OR: 3.86; p < 0.001) were associated with higher rates of open conversion. Last but not least, when the interaction between the number of patient risk factors (obesity and/or frailty and/or CCI ≥2) and hospital volume was tested, a dose-response effect was observed. Specifically, the rates of open conversion ranged from 0.3% (patients with zero risk factors treated at high-volume hospitals) to 2.2% (patients with two to three risk factors treated at low-volume hospitals). Conclusion: Overall contemporary (2008-2015) rate of open conversion at MIRP was 0.6% and it was strongly associated with patient obesity, frailty, CCI ≥2, and hospital surgical volume. In consequence, these parameters should be taken into account during preoperative patients counseling, as well as in clinical and administrative decision making.""","""['Stefano Luzzago', 'Giuseppe Rosiello', 'Angela Pecoraro', 'Marina Deuker', 'Franziska Stolzenbach', 'Francesco Alessandro Mistretta', 'Zhe Tian', 'Gennaro Musi', 'Emanuele Montanari', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Fred Saad', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Ottavio de Cobelli', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Contemporary rates and predictors of open conversion during minimally invasive partial nephrectomy for kidney cancer.', 'Diffusion of surgical innovations, patient safety, and minimally invasive radical prostatectomy.', 'Perioperative outcomes of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy compared with open radical prostatectomy: results from the nationwide inpatient sample.', 'Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: conventional and robotic.', 'Critical comparison of laparoscopic, robotic, and open radical prostatectomy: techniques, outcomes, and cost.', 'Changing trends in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: Inverse stage migration-A retrospective analysis.', '""Sandwich"" Technique of Total Urethral Reconstruction in the Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy: A Prospective Study.']"""

There were only few male axillary accessory breast cancer cases that have been reported in scientific literatures so far. Hereby, we would like to discuss a case of male axillary accessory breast cancer found in our hospital.  Patient concerns:   We report a male senile patient suffering from a painful, enlarged, and hardened right axillary mass for more than 20 years. He came for further treatments due to progressive growth of the mass for 11 months with bloody ulceration for more than 1 month.  Diagnosis:   Pathological examination manifested a grade II infiltrating ductal carcinoma derived from the accessory mammary gland (right axilla), with invasion of local skin. Immunohistochemical examination result: estrogen receptor (++) 90%, progesterone receptor (+++) 100%, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (1+), ki67 (20% positive), prostate specific antigen (-), caudal-related homeobox-2 (-), thyroid transcription factor-1 (-), Synaptophysin (+), NapsinA (1), and CK7 (-).  Interventions:   Modified radical mastectomy and axillary lymph nodes clearance were performed on the accessary breast cancer under general anesthesia. Postoperatively, endocrine therapy was provided for the patient, orally-taken Letrozole was recommended for the rest of the patient's life.  Outcomes:   The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged 3 days after the operation. The patient continued to take Letrozole orally regularly at home and no signs of recurrence were observed.  Conclusion:   Axillary accessory breast cancer in males is extremely rare, with no conspicuous and typical clinical presentations, which leads to inevitable neglect by clinicians.

However, the emergence of resistance diminishes its efficacy and limits the survival benefit. Quercetin is a dietary flavonoid which has been shown to have multiple anti-cancer effects. Also, quercetin has been reported to reverse chemo-resistance in many other cancers. This study was to determine whether quercetin could reverse docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer cells and xenograft models, thereby exploring the underlying mechanism. Depending on the docetaxel-resistant cells (LNCaP/R, PC-3/R) which were established from docetaxel-sensitive cells (LNCaP, PC-3), it was demonstrated that quercetin could reverse docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer on proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion and apoptosis. Although single docetaxel application had little effect on docetaxel-resistant cells, combining docetaxel with quercetin was significantly effective. Combination therapy could maximally inhibited PI3K/Akt pathway and promoted apoptosis. As shown by in-vivo study, xenograft tumors treated by docetaxel with quercetin had poorest growth. Then, to investigate the underlying mechanisms, the differences among parental cells, docetaxel-resistant subclones and quercetin treated resistant subclones were evaluated. It was found that docetaxel-resistant subclones had stronger activation of androgen receptor and PI3K/Akt pathway, more remarkable mesenchymal and stem-like cell phenotypes, and more P-gp expression than that of parental cells. Interestingly, quercetin could reverse these transformations. Our data revealed that quercetin had docetaxel-resistance reversal effect both in vitro and in vivo and provided in-depth support for clinical use of quercetin in docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Xinxing Lu', 'Feiya Yang', 'Dexi Chen', 'Qinxin Zhao', 'Dong Chen', 'Hao Ping', 'Nianzeng Xing']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Biol Sci""","""['Isorhamnetin inhibited the proliferation and metastasis of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells by targeting the mitochondrion-dependent intrinsic apoptotic and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.', 'Targeting the Vav3 oncogene enhances docetaxel-induced apoptosis through the inhibition of androgen receptor phosphorylation in LNCaP prostate cancer cells under chronic hypoxia.', 'PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is dominant over androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer cells.', 'The PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway and Prostate Cancer: At the Crossroads of AR, MAPK, and WNT Signaling.', 'Interplay Among PI3K/AKT, PTEN/FOXO and AR Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Flavonoids target different molecules of autophagic and metastatic pathways in cancer cells.', 'Targeting XPO6 inhibits prostate cancer progression and enhances the suppressive efficacy of docetaxel.', 'Application of Polyphenols and Flavonoids in Oncological Therapy.', 'Quercetin can be a more reliable treatment for metastatic prostate cancer than the localized disease: An in vitro study.', 'Exploring the mechanism by which quercetin re-sensitizes breast cancer to paclitaxel: network pharmacology, molecular docking, and experimental verification.']"""

Growing evidence from preclinical studies has revealed that various anesthetics can influence the immune system in different ways. The current study compared the long-term biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) in terms of selection of anesthetic agent between total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol/remifentanil and volatile anesthetics (VA) with sevoflurane or desflurane/remifentanil. Methods: We followed up oncologic outcomes of patients who underwent RALP from two previous prospective randomized controlled trials, and the outcomes of those who received TIVA (n = 64) were compared with those who received VA (n = 64). The follow-up period lasted from November 2010 to March 2019. Results: Both TIVA and VA groups showed identical biochemical recurrence-free survivals at all-time points after RALP. The following predictive factors of prostate cancer recurrence were determined by Cox regression: colloid input [hazard ratio (HR)=1.002, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.000-1.003; P = 0.011], initial prostate-specific antigen level (HR=1.025, 95% CI: 1.007-1.044; P = 0.006), and pathological tumor stage 3b (HR=4.217, 95% CI:1.207-14.735; P = 0.024), but not the anesthetic agent.

Methods:   Fifty consecutive patients with prostate cancer were treated with 6 months of triptorelin prior to definitive RT. The volume of the prostate gland was measured at the outset and every 6-7 weeks thereafter using MRI scans. The volumes were calculated using a planimetric method, and inter-rater reliability was checked. Factors associated with a large initial volume and greater reductions in it were assessed.  Results:   The median volume at the outset was 45 cc, and the median reductions every 6 weeks thereafter were 23, 18, 9 and 5%. The inter-rater agreement was high (r > 0.9, P < 0.001). There were no baseline clinical factors associated with a high initial prostate volume, but the initial volume was associated with greater volume reduction. Testosterone escape had no effect on the reduction, and changes in volume were not reflected in PSA response kinetics.  Conclusions:   Reductions in volume continue throughout a 6-month course of neo-adjuvant therapy but are greatest during the first 6 weeks.

Lactate or ventilatory thresholds might be useful submaximal alternatives, but this has never been investigated. Therefore, we aimed at comparing three training sessions prescribed using %VO2peak (reference), lactate thresholds, and ventilatory thresholds in terms of meeting the vigorous-intensity zone, physiological, and psychological responses.  Methods:   Twenty breast (58 ± 10 years) and 20 prostate cancer survivors (68 ± 6 years), 3.6 ± 2.4 months after primary therapy, completed a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test and three vigorous training sessions in randomized order: 38 min of cycling at 70% VO2peak (M-VO2peak), 97% of individual anaerobic lactate threshold (M-IAT), and 67% between ventilatory thresholds 1 and 2 (M-VT). Heart rate (HR), blood lactate concentration (bLa), perceived exertion, and enjoyment were assessed.  Results:   Cancer survivors exercised at 75 ± 23, 85 ± 18, and 79 ± 19 W during M-VO2peak, M-IAT, and M-VT (p > .05). Sessions could not be completed in 3, 8, and 6 cases. Session completers showed HR of 82 ± 7, 83 ± 9, and 84 ± 8 %HRpeak and bLa of 3.7 ± 1.9, 3.9 ± 0.9, and 3.9 ± 1.5 mmol·l-1, which was not different between sessions (p > .05). However, variance in bLa was lower in M-IAT compared to M-VO2peak (p = .001) and to M-VT (p = .022).  Conclusion:   All intensity prescription methods on average met the targeted intensity zone. Metabolic response was most homogeneous when using lactate thresholds.  Implications for cancer survivors:   Submaximal thresholds are at least as useful as VO2peak for intensity prescription in cancer survivors.

Whether a vaccine-based approach can augment this effect remains unknown.  Patients and methods:   We conducted a neoadjuvant, randomized study to quantify the immunologic effects of a GM-CSF-secreting allogeneic cellular vaccine in combination with low-dose cyclophosphamide (Cy/GVAX) followed by degarelix versus degarelix alone in patients with high-risk localized prostate adenocarcinoma who were planned for radical prostatectomy.  Results:   Both Cy/GVAX plus degarelix and degarelix alone led to significant increases in intratumoral CD8+ T-cell infiltration and PD-L1 expression as compared with a cohort of untreated, matched controls. However, the CD8+ T-cell infiltrate was accompanied by a proportional increase in regulatory T cells (Treg), suggesting that adaptive Treg resistance may dampen the immunogenicity of ADT. Although Cy/GVAX followed by degarelix was associated with a modest improvement in time-to-PSA progression and time-to-next treatment, as well as an increase in PD-L1, there was no difference in the CD8+ T-cell infiltrate as compared with degarelix alone. Gene expression profiling demonstrated that CHIT1, a macrophage marker, was differentially upregulated with Cy/GVAX plus degarelix compared with degarelix alone.  Conclusions:   Our results highlight that ADT with or without Cy/GVAX induces a complex immune response within the prostate tumor microenvironment. These data have important implications for combining ADT with immunotherapy. In particular, our finding that ADT increases both CD8+ T cells and Tregs supports the development of regimens combining ADT with Treg-depleting agents in the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Aleksandar Z Obradovic#', 'Matthew C Dallos#', 'Marianna L Zahurak', 'Alan W Partin', 'Edward M Schaeffer', 'Ashley E Ross', 'Mohamad E Allaf', 'Thomas R Nirschl', 'David Liu', 'Carolyn G Chapman', ""Tanya O'Neal"", 'Haiyi Cao', 'Jennifer N Durham', 'Gunes Guner', 'Javier A Baena-Del Valle', 'Onur Ertunc', 'Angelo M De Marzo', 'Emmanuel S Antonarakis#', 'Charles G Drake#']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Androgen deprivation as a tumour-immunomodulating treatment.', 'Systemic GM-CSF Recruits Effector T Cells into the Tumor Microenvironment in Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Safety and immunogenicity of novel 5T4 viral vectored vaccination regimens in early stage prostate cancer: a phase I clinical trial.', 'Safety and survival with GVAX pancreas prime and Listeria Monocytogenes-expressing mesothelin (CRS-207) boost vaccines for metastatic pancreatic cancer.', 'Impact of androgen-deprivation therapy on the immune system: implications for combination therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Current vaccination strategies for prostate cancer.', 'Acute exercise induces distinct quantitative and phenotypical T cell profiles in men with prostate cancer.', 'Advances in landscape and related therapeutic targets of the prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'Systematic elucidation and pharmacological targeting of tumor-infiltrating regulatory T\xa0cell master regulators.', 'Neoadjuvant enoblituzumab in localized prostate cancer: a single-arm, phase 2 trial.', 'Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes as an endpoint in cancer vaccine trials.']"""

Materials and methods:   In the present multicenter retrospective study, we enrolled 275 consecutive patients. The demographic and clinical data and mCRPC characteristics were recorded and evaluated at baseline and at the end of treatment or progression. 223Ra was administered according to the current label authorization until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. We divided the whole cohort into 2 groups: those who had undergone primary radical prostatectomy or ablative radiotherapy (RP/EBRT) and those who had not received previous primary treatment (NO).  Results:   Of the 275 patients, 128 (46.5%) were alive and undergoing monitoring at the last follow-up examination, 103 (37.4%) had stopped treatment because of disease progression or the onset of comorbidities, and 147 (53.5%) had died during the study period.

The data showed a clear advantage for the patients in the RP/EBRT group compared with those in the NO group, with an estimated median survival of 18 versus 11 months, respectively (P < .001). The results from the multivariate analysis corroborated this trend, with a hazard ratio of 0.7 (P = .0443), confirming the better outcome for the RP/EBRT group.

However, several known SET7 inhibitors exhibit weak activity or poor selectivity. Therefore, the development of novel SET7 inhibitors is highly desirable and of great clinical value. In this study, we identified 2-79 as a new hit compound by structure-based virtual screening and further AlphaLISA-based biochemical evaluation. Via chemical optimization, the synthesized compound DC21 was confirmed as a potent SET7 inhibitor with an IC50 value of 15.93 μM. The interaction between DC21 and SET7 was also validated through SPR experiment. Especially, DC21 retarded proliferation of MCF7 cells with an IC50 value of 25.84 μM in cellular level. In addition, DC21 has good selectivity for several other epigenetic targets, such as SUV39H1, G9a, NSD1, DOT1L and MOF.

However, using a co-treatment approach utilizing two or more anticancer drugs has shown tremendous success in the treatment of many cancer types. Nanoliposomes are well known to encapsulate multiple drugs and deliver them at the desired site. In this work, we report the synthesis of nanoliposomes (∼100 nm) encapsulating two drugs, plumbagin, and genistein, to synergistically inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells. The combination of plumbagin and genistein drugs was found inhibiting xenograft prostate tumor growth by ∼80 % without any appreciable toxicity. Mechanistically, the combination of plumbagin and genistein containing nanoliposomes leads to the inhibition of PI3K/AKT3 signaling pathway as well as the decreased population of Glut-1 transporters to impart the retardation in tumor growth. Decrease in proliferative cells and blood vessels are early biological processes that laid the foundation of the observed anti-tumor effect. Thus, a novel, and non-toxic liposomal formulation, containing plumbagin and genistein drugs, is reported, which can deliver anticancer agents to prostate tumors and inhibit the growth.""","""['Yuan-Yuan Song', 'Ye Yuan', 'Xu Shi', 'Yuan-Yuan Che']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces""","""['PSMA conjugated combinatorial liposomal formulation encapsulating genistein and plumbagin to induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Nanoliposomal formulation encapsulating celecoxib and genistein inhibiting COX-2 pathway and Glut-1 receptors to prevent prostate cancer cell proliferation.', 'Plumbagin-Loaded Nanoemulsion Drug Delivery Formulation and Evaluation of Antiproliferative Effect on Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Anticancer Properties and Pharmaceutical Applications of Plumbagin: A Review.', 'Genistein as a Potential Anticancer Agent Against Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Tumor cell membrane-coated continuous electrochemical sensor for GLUT1 inhibitor screening.', 'Interpreting the Therapeutic Efficiency of Multifunctional Hybrid Nanostructure against Glioblastoma.', 'A Mini-Review of Flavone Isomers Apigenin and Genistein in Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Nanocarrier cancer therapeutics with functional stimuli-responsive mechanisms.', 'Prostate cancer: Therapeutic prospect with herbal medicine.']"""

Yet, resistance arises and aberrant AR signaling promotes disease. We sought compounds that inhibited genes driving cancer but not normal growth and hypothesized that genes with consensus androgen response elements (cAREs) drive proliferation but genes with selective elements (sAREs) promote differentiation. In a high-throughput promoter-dependent drug screen, doxorubicin (dox) exhibited this ability, acting on DNA rather than AR. This dox effect was observed at low doses for multiple AR target genes in multiple PCa cell lines and also occurred in vivo. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that low dox downregulated cell cycle genes while high dox upregulated DNA damage response genes. In chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays with low dox, AR binding to sARE-containing enhancers increased, whereas AR was lost from cAREs. Further, ChIP-seq analysis revealed a subset of genes for which AR binding in low dox increased at pre-existing sites that included sites for prostate-specific factors such as FOXA1. AR dependence on cofactors at sAREs may be the basis for differential modulation by dox that preserves expression of genes for survival but not cancer progression.

Korean sources were never or rarely observed in articles focusing on a few cancer sites (e.g., breast and prostate, which Korean Americans have higher risks compared to native Koreans), cancer preventive behaviors (diet, physical activity, no smoking), and specific cancer detection methods (mammogram, pap-smear). We suggest Korean American media to reflect the cancer priority and information needs among Korean Americans, which are varied from native Koreans, and to acknowledge the differences in cancer prevention and detection guidelines between the U.S. and Korean healthcare system.

Androgen receptor (AR) signaling is central to PCa and PCa therapy. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in the regulation of prostate cancer through modulation of signaling pathways. In the present study, we illustrate the functional significance and therapeutic benefit of miR-299-3p, an AR targeting microRNA, in PCa progression. We noted loss of expression of miR-299-3p in prostate tumors compared to noncancerous prostate tissues. Replenishment of miR-299-3p in C4-2B, 22Rv-1 and PC-3 cells contributed to cell cycle arrest, reduced proliferation, migration and increased expression of apoptotic markers. Additionally, overexpression of miR-299-3p induced a reduction of AR, PSA and VEGFA expression. AGO-RNA pulldown experiment showed enrichment of AR, VEGFA and miR-299-3p in C4-2B cells overexpressing miR-299-3p. miR-299-3p overexpression also inhibited epithelial mesenchymal transition, expression of Slug, TGF-β3, phospho-AKT and phospho-PRAS40, but increased expression of E-cadherin. Furthermore, miR-299 overexpression resulted in reduced tumor growth in xenograft models and increased drug sensitivity. Overall, this study has identified novel mechanisms of antitumor and antimigration function of miR-299-3p through modulation of AR and VEGFA signaling pathways which lead to improved drug sensitivity of PCa.""","""['Kavya Ganapathy', 'Stephen Staklinski', 'Md Faqrul Hasan', 'Richard Ottman', 'Thomas Andl', 'Anders E Berglund', 'Jong Y Park', 'Ratna Chakrabarti']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Androgen receptor-regulated miRNA-193a-3p targets AJUBA to promote prostate cancer cell migration.', 'Identification of miR-30b-3p and miR-30d-5p as direct regulators of androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer by complementary functional microRNA library screening.', 'miR-103a-2-5p/miR-30c-1-3p inhibits the progression of prostate cancer resistance to androgen ablation therapy via targeting androgen receptor variant 7.', 'Interplay between the androgen receptor signaling axis and microRNAs in prostate cancer.', 'The transcriptional regulation of miR-21, its multiple transcripts, and their implication in prostate cancer.', 'Role of Interleukins in Inflammation-Mediated Tumor Immune Microenvironment Modulation in Colorectal Cancer Pathogenesis.', 'Differential Expression of miRNAs Contributes to Tumor Aggressiveness and Racial Disparity in African American Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'Anticancer function of microRNA-30e is mediated by negative regulation of HELLPAR, a noncoding macroRNA, and genes involved in ubiquitination and cell cycle progression in prostate cancer.', 'ETS-related gene (ERG) undermines genome stability in mouse prostate progenitors via Gsk3β dependent Nkx3.1 degradation.', 'Advanced Therapeutic Options for Treatment of Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostatic Adenocarcinoma.']"""

However, it remines controversial as an invasive mean for patients with PSA levels in the gray zone (4-10 ng/mL). This study aimed to develop strategy to reduce the unnecessary prostate biopsy. We retrospectively identified 235 patients with serum total PSA testing in the gray zone before prostate biopsy between 2014 and 2018. Age, PSA derivates, prostate volume and multiparametric magnetic imaging (mpMRI) examination were assessed as predictors for PCa and clinically significant PCa with Gleason score ≥ 7 (CSPCa). Univariate analysis showed that prostate volume, PSAD, and mpMRI examination were significant predictors of PCa and CSPCa (P < 0.05). The differences of diagnostic accuracy between mpMRI examination (AUC = 0.69) and other clinical parameters in diagnostic accuracy for PCa were not statistically significant. However, mpMRI examination (AUC = 0.79) outperformed prostate volume and PSAD in diagnosis of CSPCa. The multivariate models (AUC = 0.79 and 0.84 for PCa and CSPCa) performed significantly better than mpMRI examination for detection of PCa (P = 0.003) and CSPCa (P = 0.036) among patients with PSA level in the gray zone. At the same level of sensitivity as the mpMRI examination to diagnose PCa, applying the multivariate models could reduce the number of biopsies by 5% compared with mpMRI examination. Overall, our results supported the view that the multivariate model could reduce unnecessary biopsies without compromising the ability to diagnose PCa and CSPCa.

Methods: Men who had biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer with negative findings on CT and bone scintigraphy were referred for 18F-DCFPyL (2-(3-(1-carboxy-5-[(6-18F-fluoro-pyridine-3-carbonyl)-amino]-pentyl) PET/CT. Examinations were performed on 1 of 2 different brands of PET/CT scanner. All suspected tumor sites were manually contoured on coregistered CT and PET images, and each was assigned an miPSMA score as per the PROMISE criteria. The PVC factors were calculated for every lesion using the anatomic CT and then applied to the unsmoothed PET images. The miPSMA scores, with and without the corrections, were compared, and a simplified rule-of-thumb (RoT) correction factor (CF) was derived for lesions at various sizes (<4 mm, 4-7 mm, 7-9 mm, and 9-12 mm). This CF was then applied to the original dataset and the miPSMA scores that were obtained using the RoT CF were compared with those obtained using the actual corrections. Results: There were 75 men (median age, 69 y; median serum PSA, 3.69 μg/L) with 232 metastatic nodes less than 12 mm in diameter (mean lesion volume, 313.5 ± 309.6 mm3).

As those results have not been part of the global ERSPC results, it is of interest to report PCa mortality at a median follow-up of 9 years for French section of ERSPC.  Material and methods:   Two administrative departments were involved in the study. Only men after randomization in the screening group were invited by mail to be screened by PSA testing with two rounds at 4-6 year intervals. Biopsy was recommended if PSA>=3.0 ng/mL. No information other that the French Association of Urology recommandations on the use of PSA was offered to the control group (own decision of physicians and patients). Follow up was based on cancer registry database. Contamination defined as the receipt of PSA testing in control arm was measured. Poisson regression models were used to estimate the Rate Ratio (RR) of PCa mortality and incidence in the screening vs. control arm.  Results:   Starting from 2003, 80,696 men aged 55-69 years were included. The percentage of men in the screening arm with at least one PSA test (compliance) was 31%. Compared to the control arm, PCa incidence increased by 10% in the screening arm (RR=1.10; 95% CI=[1.04-1.16], P=0.001), but PCa mortality did not differ (0.222 and 0.215 deaths/1000 person-years; RR=1.03[0.75-1.42], P=0.9).  Discussion:   Limitations include low participation rate. PSA testing in the control arm was observed in 32% of men (contamination).

Previously by LC/ESI-MSMS, we screened for HO-1 interacting proteins and identified annexin 2 (ANXA2). The aim of this study was to analyze the relevance of ANXA2/HO-1 in PCa and bone metastasis.  Methods:   We assessed ANXA2 levels using a co-culture transwell system of PC3 cells (pre-treated or not with hemin, an HO-1 specific inducer) and the pre-osteoclastic Raw264.7 cell line.  Results:   Under co-culture conditions, ANXA2 mRNA levels were significantly modulated in both cell lines. Immunofluorescence analysis unveiled a clear ANXA2 reduction in cell membrane immunostaining for Raw264.7 under the same conditions. This effect was supported by the detection of a decrease in Ca2+ concentration in the conditioned medium. HO-1 induction in tumor cells prevented both, the ANXA2 intracellular relocation and the decrease in Ca2+ concentration. Further, secretome analysis revealed urokinase (uPA) as a key player in the communication between osteoclast progenitors and PC3 cells. To assess the clinical significance of ANXA2/HO-1, we performed a bioinformatics analysis and identified that low expression of each gene strongly associated with poor prognosis in PCa regardless of the clinico-pathological parameters assessed.

It was proven that some viruses are capable of causing cancer, and the dependency of prostatic and mammary hyperplasia and carcinoma on naturally occurring hormones was established. Colon cancer was linked to hereditary and nonhereditary polyposis. A permanent place for diagnostic radiology was defined and radiation therapy advanced to preoperative and postoperative modalities using x-ray and radium. The trend toward the use of radical surgery for primary and metastatic cancers continued. Although several new radical surgical procedures were developed and advanced as far as the technical skills of surgeons and the anatomic setting permitted, several innovative, less radical procedures were introduced. In chemotherapy, the basic principle of the treatment of advanced cancers with hormones was inaugurated. Pathologists synthesized what was known in tumor pathology, named new microscopic entities, recognized carcinoma in situ, developed histologic grading and pathologic staging of cancers, and introduced aspiration cytology and exfoliative cytology as new fields in oncology. It is interesting that despite profound global economic, social, and political upheaval and wars and preparation for wars, writers and producers of musicals and movies presented more memorable works than ever before. In the fields of science and technology, particularly nuclear physics and chemistry, profound discoveries were made that became a permanent part of human life. The progress made in oncology between 1922 and 1942 came about through the dedicated work of many individuals. However, there were 7 pathfinders (3 surgeons, 2 pathologists, 1 physician-chemist, and 1 physician-cytologist) who, despite their widely diverse backgrounds, personalities, and interest, made outstanding contributions to oncology to the magnitude that they deserve a permanent place in the history of medicine and oncology.""","""['Steven I Hajdu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Pathfinders in oncology from the time the causal relation between tobacco use and lung cancer was established to publication of the first Cancer Staging Manual by the American Joint Committee on Cancer.', 'Pathfinders in oncology from the end of the 19th century to the first description of Ewing sarcoma.', 'Pathfinders in oncology from the first clinical use of single-agent chemotherapy to the introduction of mammography.', 'Pathfinders in oncology from the end of the Middle Ages to the beginning of the 19th century.', 'The evolution of the diagnosis and understanding of primitive and embryonic neoplasms in children: living through an epoch.']"""

Patients and methods:   Quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) was conducted to examine UNC5B-AS1 expression in 50 pairs of tumor tissue specimens and paracancerous ones collected from PCa patients, and the interplay between UNC5B-AS1 expression and clinical indicators of PCa was also analyzed. Meanwhile, UNC5B-AS1 levels in PCa cell lines were also further verified by qRT-PCR. In addition, UNC5B-AS1 knockdown model was constructed using lentivirus in PCa cell lines, and cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), transwell and flow cytometry assays were performed to figure out the impact of UNC5B-AS1 on the biological function of PCa cells. Finally, cell recovery experiment was conducted to explore the underlying mechanism and the association between UNC5B-AS1 and caspase-9.  Results:   QRT-PCR results suggested that UNC5B-AS1 expression in PCa tissue samples was remarkably higher than in adjacent ones, with a statistically significant difference. Compared with patients with low expression of UNC5B-AS1, patients with highly-expressed UNC5B-AS1 had a higher incidence of distant metastasis and more advanced pathological stage. At the same time, proliferation and invasion, as well as migration ability of cells in sh-UNC5B-AS1 group, was conspicuously attenuated while cell apoptosis ability was conversely enhanced. Furthermore, qRT-PCR results revealed that caspase-9 and UNC5B-AS1 showed a negative correlation in gene expression level in PCa tissues. The results of the luciferase reporter gene experiment demonstrated that UNC5B-AS1 can be targeted by caspase-9 through their binding site. Additionally, cell recovery experiment indicated that UNC5B-AS1 and caspase-9 can be mutually regulated, which then together affect the malignant progression of PCa.  Conclusions:   UNC5B-AS1 expression was found remarkably increased in both PCa tissues and cell lines, which was remarkably associated with pathological stage and incidence of distant metastasis of PCa patients.

IL-6, a mediator of chronic inflammation, induces the progression of prostate cancer, and influences the polarization of M2 macrophages, which are the main tumor-associated macrophages. We investigated whether IL-6 produced by human prostate epithelial cells stimulated with Tv induces the M2 polarization of THP-1-derived macrophages, which in turn promotes the progression of PCa. Conditioned medium was prepared from Tv-infected (TCM) and uninfected (CM) prostate epithelial cells (RWPE-1). Thereafter conditioned medium was prepared from macrophages after incubation with CM (M-CM) or TCM (M-TCM). RWPE-1 cells infected with Tv produced IL-6 and chemokines such as CCL2 and CXCL8. When human macrophages were treated with conditioned medium of RWPE-1 cells co-cultured with Tv (TCM), they became polarized to M2-like macrophages as indicated by the production of IL-10 and TGF-β, and the expression of CD36 and arginase-1, which are M2 macrophage markers. Moreover, proliferation of the M2-like macrophages was also increased by TCM. Blockade of IL-6 signaling with IL-6 receptor antibody and JAK inhibitor (Ruxolitinib) inhibited M2 polarization of THP-1-derived macrophages and proliferation of the macrophages. To assess the effect of crosstalk between macrophages and prostate epithelial cells inflamed by Tv infection on the growth of prostate cancer (PCa) cells, PC3, DU145 and LNCaP cells were treated with conditioned medium from THP-1-derived macrophages stimulated with TCM (M-TCM).

Here we demonstrated that MIIP acts as a suppressor of PCa by inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell invasion. Overexpressing MIIP repressed cellular invasion of PC3 and DU145 in vitro, accompanied by a decrease of EMT-inducing factors, and an increase of E-cadherin and KLF17. Moreover, a stable MIIP knockdown in PCa cells promoted the tumor growth or bone osteolytic lesions, when xenografted subcutaneously or via tibia injection. Mechanistically, MIIP represses two onco-miRNAs, miR-181a-5p and miR-181b-5p, thus removing the inhibitory effect of these two miRNAs on their target KLF17, which functions as a negative regulator of EMT by directly suppressing the transcription of SNAIL1/2 and TWIST. Finally, by examining the expression of MIIP, miR-181a/b-5p, KLF17, and E-cadherin in paired cancer samples v.s. adjacent normal tissues from a cohort of human prostate cancer patients, we demonstrated that downregulation of MIIP was well associated with downregulation of KLF17 and E-cadherin, but upregulation of miR-181a/b-5p. The positive correlation between MIIP and KLF17 was also confirmed via immunohistochemical staining of a PCa tissue microarray.

The purpose of this single-center prospective study was to evaluate the comparative prognostic utility of PERCIST 1.0 in predicting overall survival (OS) in patients with mCRPC compared to RECIST 1.1 and prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based treatment response assessments. Methods: Patients with mCRPC were prospectively enrolled if they were beginning systemic medical therapy or transitioning to new systemic therapy after not responding to a prior treatment. All patients underwent a baseline 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/ computed tomography (PET/CT) prior to the initiation of treatment and again 4 months after the start of therapy. Patients' responses to treatment at 4 months compared to baseline were evaluated with RECIST 1.1, PERCIST 1.0 and PSA response criteria. The associations between patients' response categories and OS were evaluated. OS was defined as the duration in time between the date of baseline PET/CT to death from any cause. Patients with different response status were compared with logrank tests. Survival probabilities were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: Patients with progressive disease by PSA response criteria at 4 months demonstrated significantly shorter OS (24-month OS probability: 18% ± 11%) compared to patients with stable disease, SD, (44% ± 19%, p=0.03) and complete response, CR, or partial response, PR, (53% ± 11%, p=0.03). RECIST 1.1 response criteria demonstrated a similar trend in OS, however no statistically significant differences were noted between patients with PD (25% ± 15%) compared to SD/non-CR, non-PD (54% ± 13%) and CR/PR (54% ± 14%) (p=0.13).

Here, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy, long-term toxicity, and biodistribution of 125I-DCIBzL in a micrometastatic model of prostate cancer (PC). Methods: To test the therapeutic efficacy of 125I-DCIBzL in micrometastatic PC, we used a murine model of human metastatic PC in which PSMA+ PC3-ML cells expressing firefly luciferase were injected intravenously in NSG mice to form micrometastatic deposits. One week later, 0, 0.37, 1.85, 3.7, 18.5, 37, or 111 MBq of 125I-DCIBzL was administered (intravenously). Metastatic tumor burden was assessed using bioluminescence imaging (BLI). Long-term toxicity was evaluated via serial weights and urinalysis of non-tumor-bearing mice over a 12-month period, as well as final necropsy. Results: In the micrometastatic PC model, activities of 18.5 MBq 125I-DCIBzL and above significantly delayed development of detectable metastatic disease by BLI and prolonged survival in mice. Gross metastases were detectable in control mice and those treated with 0.37-3.7 MBq 125I-DCIBzL at a median of 2 weeks post-treatment, versus 4 weeks for those treated with 18.5-111 MBq 125I-DCIBzL (P<0.0001 by log-rank test). Similarly, treatment with ≥18.5 MBq 125I-DCIBzL yielded a median survival of 11 weeks, compared with 6 weeks for control mice (P<0.0001). At 12 months, there was no appreciable toxicity via weight, urinalysis, or necropsy evaluation in mice treated with any activity of 125I-DCIBzL, which represents markedly less toxicity than the analogous PSMA-targeted α-particle emitter. Macro-to-microscale dosimetry modeling demonstrated lower absorbed dose in renal cell nuclei versus tumor cell nuclei due to lower levels of drug uptake and cellular internalization in combination with the short range of Auger emissions. Conclusion: PSMA-targeted radiopharmaceutical therapy with the Auger emitter 125I-DCIBzL significantly delayed development of detectable metastatic disease and improved survival in a micrometastatic model of PC, with no long-term toxicities noted at 12 months, suggesting a favorable therapeutic ratio for treatment of micrometastatic PC.""","""['Colette J Shen', 'Il Minn', 'Robert F Hobbs', 'Ying Chen', 'Anders Josefsson', 'Mary Brummet', 'Sangeeta R Banerjee', 'Cory F Brayton', 'Ronnie C Mease', 'Martin G Pomper', 'Ana P Kiess']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Auger Radiopharmaceutical Therapy Targeting Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen.', '(2S)-2-(3-(1-Carboxy-5-(4-211At-Astatobenzamido)Pentyl)Ureido)-Pentanedioic Acid for PSMA-Targeted α-Particle Radiopharmaceutical Therapy.', 'Preclinical Evaluation of 203/212Pb-Labeled Low-Molecular-Weight Compounds for Targeted Radiopharmaceutical Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Efficacy Against Human Prostate Cancer by Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-specific, Transforming Growth Factor-β Insensitive Genetically Targeted CD8+ T-cells Derived from Patients with Metastatic Castrate-resistant Disease.', 'Radioimmunotherapy of Metastatic Prostate Cancer with ¹⁷⁷Lu-DOTAhuJ591 Anti Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen Specific Monoclonal Antibody.', 'Preclinical Efficacy of a PARP-1 Targeted Auger-Emitting Radionuclide in Prostate Cancer.', 'Searching for a Paradigm Shift in Auger-Electron Cancer Therapy with Tumor-Specific Radiopeptides Targeting the Mitochondria and/or the Cell Nucleus.', 'Auger Emitter Conjugated PARP Inhibitor for Therapy in Triple Negative Breast Cancers: A Comparative In-Vitro Study.', 'Development of A Decahedral Nanoenzyme Capable of Overcoming Hypoxia to Facilitate the Iodine-125 Radiosensitization of Esophageal Cancer.', 'A Third Generation Potentially Bifunctional Trithiol Chelate, Its nat,1XXSb(III) Complex, and Selective Chelation of Radioantimony (119Sb) from Its Sn Target.']"""

Methods: C4-2, C4-2B, or 22Rv1 cells were injected into the left ventricle of male NSG mice. Disease progression was monitored using bioluminescence imaging (BLI). For treatment, mice were injected with 40 kBq 225Ac-PSMA-617 at one (early treatment cohort) or three weeks (late treatment cohort) post-inoculation. Treatment efficacy was monitored by BLI of whole-body tumor burden. Mice were sacrificed based on body conditioning score. Results: C4-2 cells yielded metastases in liver, lungs, spleen, stomach, bones, and brain - achieving a clinically relevant model of widespread metastatic disease. The disease burden in the early treatment cohort was stable over 27 weeks in 5/9 mice and progressive in 4/9 mice. These mice were sacrificed due to brain metastases. Median survival of the late treatment cohort was superior to controls (13 vs. 7 weeks; p<0.0001) but inferior to that in the early treatment cohort (13 vs. 27 weeks; p<0.001). Late cohort mice succumbed to extensive liver involvement. The 22Rv1 and C4-2B systemic models were not used for treatment due to high kidney metastatic burden or low take rate, respectively. Conclusion: C4-2 cells reproduced metastatic cancer spread most relevantly. Early treatment with 225Ac-PSMA-617 prevented liver metastases and led to significant survival benefit.

Although the effects of PAK6 on many malignancies, especially in prostate cancer, have been studied for a long time, the role of PAK6 in mitochondria remains unknown. Methods: The expression of PAK6, SIRT4 and ANT2 in prostate cancer and adjacent non-tumor tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry. Immunofuorescence and immunoelectron microscopy were used to determine the subcellular localization of PAK6. Immunoprecipitation, immunofuorescence and ubiquitination assays were performed to determine how PAK6 regulates SIRT4, how SIRT4 regulates ANT2, and how PAK6 regulates ANT2. Flow cytometry detection and xenograft models were used to evaluate the impact of ANT2 mutant expression on the prostate cancer cell cycle and apoptosis regulation. Results: The present study revealed that the PAK6-SIRT4-ANT2 complex is involved in mitochondrial apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. It was found that PAK6 is mainly located in the mitochondrial inner membrane, in which PAK6 promotes SIRT4 ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Furthermore, SIRT4 deprives the ANT2 acetylation at K105 to promote its ubiquitination degradation. Hence, PAK6 adjusts the acetylation level of ANT2 through the PAK6-SIRT4-ANT2 pathway, in order to regulate the stability of ANT2. Meanwhile, PAK6 directly phosphorylates ANT2 atT107 to inhibit the apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. Therefore, the phosphorylation and deacetylation modifications of ANT2 are mutually regulated, leading to tumor growth in vivo. Consistently, these clinical prostate cancer tissue evaluations reveal that PAK6 is positively correlated with ANT2 expression, but negatively correlated with SIRT4. Conclusion: These present findings suggest the pivotal role of the PAK6-SIRT4-ANT2 complex in the apoptosis of prostate cancer. This complex could be a potential biomarker for the treatment and prognosis of prostate cancer.""","""['Tingting Li', 'Yang Li', 'Tong Liu', 'Bingtao Hu', 'Jiabin Li', 'Chen Liu', 'Tao Liu', 'Feng Li']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['SIRT4 regulates ATP homeostasis and mediates a retrograde signaling via AMPK.', 'p21-Activated kinase 6 (PAK6) inhibits prostate cancer growth via phosphorylation of androgen receptor and tumorigenic E3 ligase murine double minute-2 (Mdm2).', 'HIF-1α-dependent miR-424 induction confers cisplatin resistance on bladder cancer cells through down-regulation of pro-apoptotic UNC5B and SIRT4.', 'Adenine nucleotide translocase 2 is a key mitochondrial protein in cancer metabolism.', 'The mitochondrial adenine nucleotide transporters in myogenesis.', 'Sirtuins at the Crossroads between Mitochondrial Quality Control and Neurodegenerative Diseases: Structure, Regulation, Modifications, and Modulators.', 'Targeting P21-Activated Kinase-1 for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Mitochondrial Alterations in Prostate Cancer: Roles in Pathobiology and Racial Disparities.', 'DNA-PKcs and ATM modulate mitochondrial ADP-ATP exchange as an oxidative stress checkpoint mechanism.', 'Non-canonical phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase activity promotes liver cancer growth via mitochondrial translation and respiratory metabolism.']"""

The KL family currently comprises of three proteins: α-Klotho (KLA), β-Klotho (KLB), and γ-Klotho (KLG). Many studies have shown that KLA and KLB participate in tumor progression or suppression, depending on the type of cancer; however, the relationship between KLG and prostate cancer has not yet been studied. Some studies have claimed that KL is correlated to sensitivity to chemotherapy. Here, we investigated the oncogenic potential of KLG in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Immunohistochemical analysis using prostate biopsy specimens revealed that patients with high KLG expression in primary prostate cancer tissue had a significantly poor prognosis for overall survival. In addition, the prostate-specific antigen response rate after docetaxel (DTX) therapy in patients with high KLG expression was lower than that in patients with low KLG expression. To evaluate the potential of KLG as a therapeutic target in human prostate cancer, we generated a xenograft model of human CRPC cell line (PC-3) in male athymic mice. The animals were randomly divided into four groups as follows: i) control group (vehicle only); ii) DTX group (intraperitoneal administration); iii) small interfering RNA targeting KLG (KLG siRNA) group (intratumoral administration); and iv) a combination group (DTX plus KLG siRNA). After 3 weeks of treatment, the tumor weight and tumor Ki-67 labeling index were significantly lower in the KLG siRNA group and the combination group than in the control group. Sensitivity to DTX was increased upon treatment with KLG siRNA. These findings suggest that KLG expression in primary prostate cancer lesions is associated with resistance to DTX in CRPC and has potential as a diagnostic and therapeutic target for patients with CRPC.""","""['Kenta Onishi', 'Makito Miyake', 'Shunta Hori', 'Sayuri Onishi', 'Kota Iida', 'Yosuke Morizawa', 'Yoshihiro Tatsumi', 'Yasushi Nakai', 'Nobumichi Tanaka', 'Kiyohide Fujimoto']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Oncol Lett""","""['Development and Evaluation of a PSMA-Targeted Nanosystem Co-Packaging Docetaxel and Androgen Receptor siRNA for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Efficacy of Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Receiving Docetaxel-Based Chemotherapy.', 'Codelivery of GRP78 siRNA and docetaxel via RGD-PEG-DSPE/DOPA/CaP nanoparticles for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Molecular mechanisms of docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Clinical Development of Darolutamide: A Novel Androgen Receptor Antagonist for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Association between Serum Soluble α-Klotho and Urinary Albumin Excretion in Middle-Aged and Older US Adults: NHANES 2007-2016.', 'Emerging Proteins in CRPC: Functional Roles and Clinical Implications.', 'New developments in the biology of fibroblast growth factors.', 'Progress in Natural Compounds/siRNA Co-delivery Employing Nanovehicles for Cancer Therapy.']"""

Voltage-gated K+ (KV) channels in the plasma membrane are critically involved in the proliferation of tumor cells. Therefore, KV channels are considered as a novel potential target for cancer treatment. The results of the present study show that the external perfusion of DIDS activates IK in a concentration-dependent manner, although the known K+ channel blocker TEA failed to block the DIDS activated IK in PC-3 cells. Whereas, in LNCaP cells, the higher concentration of DIDS blocked IK, though this effect was not completely recovered after washout. The difference in function of DIDS might be due to the expression of different Kv channel isoforms in LNCaP and PC-3 cells. Further, the anticancer studies show that treatment of DIDS significantly induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and induced moderate and low level of cell death in LNCaP and PC-3 cells respectively.

We selected 2,076 adult patients who underwent primary LDLT during 7 years from January 2010 to December 2016.  Results:   The pretransplant hepatic malignancy group (n = 1,012) showed 45 cases (4.4%) of the following extrahepatic DNMs: posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) in 10; lung cancer in 10; stomach cancer in 6; colorectal cancer in 5; urinary bladder cancer in 3; and other cancers in 11.

Primarily, the cyanobacteria and microalgae from fresh and marine water are previously studied, however those isolated from soil and agriculture drain water were poorly investigated. Therefore, this study aimed to screen and characterize the antioxidant profile, as well as the potential anticancer assessment of 12 species of cyanobacteria and two species of microalgae strains isolated from soil and agriculture drain water. The data showed that total phenol contents were highest in Anabaena oryzae and Aphanizomenon gracile (27.39 and 26.83 mg GAE/g, respectively), followed by Leptolyngbya fragilis (22.96 mg GAE/g). Out of the 14 species identified, the cyanobacterium Dolichospermum flos-aquae HSSASE2 exhibited the most elevated antioxidant activity in terms of NO scavenging activity and anti-lipid peroxidation potential (IC50 = 28.7 ± 0.1 and 11.9 ± 0.2 μg/ml, respectively) and the lowest DPPH radical scavenging activity (467.7 μg/ml). Screening of the anticancer potential of all studied strains against four different human cancer cell lines (Caco-2, MCF-7, PC3, and HepG-2) demonstrated that Dolichospermum crassum HSSASE20 has the highest anticancer effect among all tested species against colon and prostate cancer cell lines (IC50 = 57.9 ± 0.4 and 44.1 ± 0.2 μg/ml, respectively), while Oscillatoria sancta HSSASE19 recorded the most anticancer effect against MCF-7 (breast cancer) cell line (IC50 = 15.1 ± 0.7 μg/ml). Dolichospermum spiroides HSSASE18 obtained the highest anticancer effect HepG-2 (hepatic cancer) cell line (IC50 = 48.8 ± 0.7 μg/ml). Additionally, cytotoxicity against healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells was studied and revealed that Oscillatoria sancta was the safest one among all studied strains. Data obtained from the sensitivity index demonstrated that Dolichospermum crassum was the most sensitive strain against the four cancerous cell lines. Cyanobacteria and microalgae from the soil and drain water sources are efficient free radical scavengers, containing apoptogens capable of stimulating apoptotic cascades and overcoming chemo-resistance in cancer therapy.

Searching for strategies that would extend the use of PARP inhibitors to BRCA1-proficient tumors, we found that the stability of BRCA1 protein following ionizing radiation (IR) is maintained by postphosphorylational prolyl-isomerization adjacent to Ser1191 of BRCA1, catalyzed by prolyl-isomerase Pin1. Extinction of Pin1 decreased homologous recombination (HR) to the level of BRCA1-deficient cells. Pin1 stabilizes BRCA1 by preventing ubiquitination of Lys1037 of BRCA1. Loss of Pin1, or introduction of a BRCA1-mutant refractory to Pin1 binding, decreased the ability of BRCA1 to localize to repair foci and augmented IR-induced DNA damage. In vitro growth of HR-proficient breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancer cells were modestly repressed by olaparib or Pin1 inhibition using all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), while combination treatment resulted in near-complete block of cell proliferation. In MDA-MB-231 xenografts and triple-negative breast cancer patient-derived xenografts, either loss of Pin1 or ATRA treatment reduced BRCA1 expression and sensitized breast tumors to olaparib. Together, our study reveals that Pin1 inhibition, with clinical widely used ATRA, acts as an effective HR disrupter that sensitizes BRCA1-proficient tumors to PARP inhibition. SIGNIFICANCE: PARP inhibitors have been limited to treat homologous recombination-deficient tumors. All-trans retinoic acid, by inhibiting Pin1 and destabilizing BRCA1, extends benefit of PARP inhibitors to patients with homologous recombination-proficient tumors.See related commentary by Cai, p. 2977.""","""['Man-Li Luo#', 'Fang Zheng#', 'Wenying Chen', 'Zhi-Mei Liang', 'Gurushankar Chandramouly', 'Jianan Tan', 'Nicholas A Willis', 'Chun-Hau Chen', 'Mateus de Oliveira Taveira', 'Xiao Zhen Zhou', 'Kun Ping Lu', 'Ralph Scully', 'Gerburg M Wulf', 'Hai Hu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['A Novel Mechanism to Induce BRCAness in Cancer Cells.', 'A Novel Mechanism to Induce BRCAness in Cancer Cells.', 'Co-targeting poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) in triple-negative breast cancer: Higher synergism in BRCA mutated cells.', 'BKM120 sensitizes BRCA-proficient triple negative breast cancer cells to olaparib through regulating FOXM1 and Exo1 expression.', 'A Novel Mechanism to Induce BRCAness in Cancer Cells.', 'Therapeutic targeting and patient selection for cancers with homologous recombination defects.', 'Advances in PARP inhibitors for the treatment of breast cancer.', 'Discovery of Ruthenium(II) Metallocompound and Olaparib Synergy for Cancer Combination Therapy.', 'PIN1 and CDK1 cooperatively govern pVHL stability and suppressive functions.', 'Reciprocal inhibition of PIN1 and APC/CCDH1 controls timely G1/S transition and creates therapeutic vulnerability.', 'The DNA Double-Strand Break Repair in Glioma: Molecular Players and Therapeutic Strategies.', 'YTHDF1 promotes breast cancer cell growth, DNA damage repair and chemoresistance.']"""

Objective:   To verify the safety and outcomes of RS-RARP performed by young surgeons during the learning curve.  Design, setting, and participants:   We conducted a retrospective analysis of the pre-, intra-, and postoperative features of all the patients who underwent RS-RARP from 2013 to 2017. We divided our patients into two groups: patients operated by two experienced surgeons (ESs) with >100 procedures and patients operated on by five younger surgeons in the learning curve (LCSs). LCSs had no previous experience in radical prostatectomy, and the very first RS-RARP procedures of each LCS case are included in the analysis.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Perioperative, oncological, and functional data were analyzed. Short-term oncological results were reported as positive surgical margins (PSMs) and 1-yr disease-free survival. Complications were graded according to the Clavien-Dindo system. Potency was defined as erections sufficient for intercourse; continence was defined as no pad or one safety liner. A propensity score-matching analysis was used to adjust the difference in baseline preoperative parameters between the groups.  Results and limitations:   We obtained two homogeneous groups of 256 patients each. After the matching, preoperative variables were similar in the two groups. The mean console time was longer for younger surgeons (98 vs 122 min, p < 0.001). Postoperative course, complications, and functional results were similar in the two groups; the final pathological analysis showed a worse T stage in the ES group (p = 0.017).

Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and multivariable Cox models were used to assess the independent impact of SPOP mutation on survival, biochemical recurrence and time to metastasis. The Decipher retrospective cohort was also used to assess the impact of the addition of SPOP mutation status to a model predicting adverse pathology at prostatectomy which was then validated in the Decipher prospective cohort.  Results:   A fixed-effect model incorporating results from multivariable Cox regression including 5,811 subjects demonstrated that SPOP mutation was associated with a lower rate of adverse pathology at radical prostatectomy (odds ratios 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.34-0.93), independent of preoperative prostate-specific antigen, age, and pathologic Gleason score. SPOP was not associated with biochemical recurrence, metastasis-free survival, or cancer-specific survival independent of pathologic information. The addition of SPOP status to prognostic models reclassified a large proportion of patients with the mutation (55%) into a favorable risk group when used to predict adverse pathology.

Therefore, this study evaluated the prognostic impact of timing of chemotherapy (start during winter darkness or outside of this season), in terms of overall survival, in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (MCRPC) who received oncology care at the Nordland hospital Bodø. The study included 111 patients treated with first-line docetaxel chemotherapy for MCRPC. Twenty patients (18%) started their treatment during winter darkness (arbitrarily defined as ±4 weeks around 21 December). In unadjusted univariate analysis, survival was shorter in this group (median 10.2 vs. 18.9 months, p = 0.055). However, not all baseline parameters were equally distributed between the two groups. In multivariable-adjusted Cox regression analysis accounting for several confounding variables, only one factor was statistically significant: pre-chemotherapy serum lactate dehydrogenase level (a surrogate marker of disease burden).

Active surveillance is the preferred treatment modality for low risk prostate cancer. However, many fear offering this alternative to men with germline mutations. We describe the short-term oncologic outcomes of active surveillance in a population of men with a high genetic predisposition for prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   A prospective cohort of men with germline DNA repair gene mutations were diagnosed with Grade Group 1 prostate cancer. All men were offered active surveillance. Followup consisted of prostate specific antigen every 3 months, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and a magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion confirmatory biopsy within 1 year of diagnosis. The primary end points included treatment and progression-free survival.  Results:   Eighteen carriers of DNA repair gene mutations were diagnosed with low risk prostate cancer (BRCA1 [8], BRCA2 [6], CHEK2 [2], Lynch syndrome [2]). Of these patients 15 (83%) initiated active surveillance and 3 (17%) declined. All but 1 were fully compliant with the active surveillance protocol (93%). Overall 20% (3) had upgrading at confirmatory biopsy and were treated. At a median followup of 28 months (IQR 8.5-42) 80% of patients (12) on active surveillance are free from upgrading or radical treatment.  Conclusions:   Active surveillance may be feasible among carriers diagnosed with low risk prostate cancer. If embarking on active surveillance, carriers should be very carefully monitored at a specialized clinic, optimizing patient compliance and minimizing risk. Until larger scale studies with long-term followup become available, this option should be cautiously discussed with the patient.""","""['Daniel Halstuch', 'Yaara Ber', 'Daniel Kedar', 'Shay Golan', 'Jack Baniel', 'David Margel']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Editorial Comment.', 'Germline Mutations in ATM and BRCA1/2 Are Associated with Grade Reclassification in Men on Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer.', 'Risk of Metastasis in Men with Grade Group 2 Prostate Cancer Managed with Active Surveillance at a Tertiary Cancer Center.', 'Impact of Biopsy Compliance on Outcomes for Patients on Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer.', 'Bringing Prostate Cancer Germline Genetics into Clinical Practice.', 'Germline Testing for Prostate Cancer Prognosis: Implications for Active Surveillance.', 'Recent Research Advances in Double-Strand Break and Mismatch Repair Defects in Prostate Cancer and Potential Clinical Applications.', 'Review of Active Surveillance in Underrepresented and High-Risk Populations: Feasibility and Safety.', 'Prostate cancer risk, screening and management in patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations.', 'Addressing Challenges and Controversies in the Management of Prostate Cancer with Multidisciplinary Teams.', 'Germline mutations in penetrant cancer predisposition genes are rare in men with prostate cancer selecting active surveillance.']"""

Objective:   To identify factors associated with receipt of nondefinitive therapy (NDT) among patients aged 70 years and younger with high-risk prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cohort study identified 72 036 patients aged 70 years and younger with high-risk prostate cancer and Charlson Comorbidity Index scores of 2 or less who were entered in the National Cancer Database between January 2004 and December 2014. Data analysis was conducted from November 2018 to December 2019.  Exposure:   Receipt of NDT as an initial treatment approach.  Main outcomes and measures:   Survival rates were compared based on receipt of definitive therapy or NDT, and sociodemographic and health-related factors were associated with the type of therapy received. Residual life expectancy was estimated from the National Center for Health Statistics to calculate person-years of life lost.  Results:   A total of 72 036 men with a median (range) age of 63 (30-70) years, Charlson Comorbidity Index scores of 2 or less, and high-risk prostate cancer without regional lymph node or distant metastatic disease were analyzed. Among eligible patients, 5252 (7.3%) received NDT as an initial therapeutic strategy. On univariate and multivariate analyses, NDT was associated with worse overall survival (univariate analysis hazard ratio, 2.54; 95% CI, 2.40-2.69; P < .001; multivariate analysis hazard ratio, 2.40; 95% CI, 2.26-2.56; P < .001). Compared with patients with private insurance or managed care, those with no insurance, Medicaid, or Medicare were more likely to receive systemic therapy only (no insurance: odds ratio [OR], 3.34; 95% CI, 2.81-3.98; P < .001; Medicaid: OR, 2.92; 95% CI, 2.48-3.43; P < .001; Medicare: OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.20-1.53; P < .001) or no treatment (no insurance: OR, 2.63; 95% CI, 2.24-3.08; P < .001; Medicaid: OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.45-2.01; P < .001; Medicare: OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.04-1.24; P = .004). Compared with white patients, black patients were more likely to receive systemic therapy only (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.74-2.14; P < .001) or no treatment (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.32-1.61; P < .001), and Hispanic patients were more likely to receive systemic therapy only (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.13-1.64; P = .001) or no treatment (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.14-1.60; P < .001).

Conclusions and relevance:   In this study, receipt of NDT was associated with insurance status and race/ethnicity. While treatment decisions should be individualized for every patient, younger men with high-risk prostate cancer and minimal comorbidities should be encouraged to receive definitive local therapy regardless of other factors.

This is a technically-demanding procedure with a long learning curve. Therefore, an improvement of the surgical technique is very important in order to simplify training for LRP. Dorsal vein ligation and vesicourethral anastomosis (VUA) are two major problems for surgeons with insufficient experience in LRP. Previous studies have shown that between 50 and 250 procedures are required in order to get necessary skills.  Aim:   to compare and study the advantages of the ""free-tie"" technique and interrupted suture during the formation of VUA during learning curve of LRP.  Materials and methods:   a single-center retrospective analysis was performed by evaluating operational reports, video recordings and histories of patients who were operated at Saint Petersburg Public Hospital of Saint Luca from 2016 to 2018. A total of 114 patients were included in the study, 56 of them were undergone to ""free-tie"" technique and 48 patients had interrupted suture. All procedures were performed by four surgeons with an experience of less than 100 LRP. The evaluation criteria included the time of formation of VUA, the duration of whole procedure, the duration of bladder catheterization, frequency of anastomotic leak and stress urinary incontinence.  Results:   For surgeons who learned the technique of LRP, the use of a continuous suture with a self-anchoring V-loc thread allowed to reduce significantly the time of formation of VUA and ligation of dorsal venous plexus. Such a suture is more convenient for the surgeon than interrupted suture and makes LRP more proficient and efficient, allowing to reduce the time of procedure, the duration of catheterization, postoperative complications rate associated with anastomotic leak, and also to lower frequency of stress urinary incontinence and obstruction of VUA. This technique may reduce the period necessary for mastering LRP.

Previous studies of the clinical impact of gDDRm have mainly been in the setting of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). This study aimed to determine the prognostic value of gDDRm in de novo metastatic and castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC).  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively collected the records of 139 consecutive men with de novo mCSPC who initially received systemic therapies following guidelines. This included 128 patients who underwent genetic testing at our center and 11 patients referred to our center after being identified as gDDRm carriers. Time to mCRPC was collected. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank analysis were used to analyze the association between gDDRm and clinical outcomes. Survival outcomes were adjusted using multivariable Cox regression models.  Results:   Of the 139 patients with de novo mCSPC, 28 gDDRm carriers were identified. Median time progressing to mCRPC was significantly shorter in patients carrying gDDRm than in those without mutations (8.3 vs 13.2 months; hazard ratio [HR], 2.37; p < .001). Moreover, median progression time was almost halved in BRCA2 carriers (6.3 vs. 13.2 months; HR, 3.73; p < .001). Subgroup analysis revealed that the presence of gDDRm indicated poor therapy response regardless of disease volume and prostate-specific antigen nadir within the first 7 months. Presence of gDDRm remained independently associated with increased risk of progression to mCRPC in multivariate analysis (adjusted HR, 1.98; p = .006).  Conclusion:   Our study suggested that positive gDDRm status predicted rapid progression to castration resistance in patients with de novo mCSPC. We propose identifying gDDRm status at the time of diagnosis for mCSPC patients, considering it is the first step of tailoring individualized treatment. In addition, DNA repair genes were a good therapeutic target for poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, and our results call for more frontline targeted therapy trials in gDDRm carriers to prolong the progression time.  Implications for practice:   Results of this study suggested that positive germline DNA damage repair gene mutation (gDDRm) status predicted earlier progression to castration resistance in patients with de novo metastatic and castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC). These findings indicated the importance of intense therapy for some subgroups of mCSPC, especially for mCSPC harboring gDDRm with low-volume disease. Moreover, gDDRm was a good therapeutic target for poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, and these findings call for more molecular marker driven trials moving to the mTNPC setting.""","""['Yu Wei', 'Junlong Wu', 'Weijie Gu', 'Jun Wang', 'Guowen Lin', 'Xiaojian Qin', 'Bo Dai', 'Hualei Gan', 'Dingwei Ye', 'Yao Zhu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Oncologist""","""['Clinical Outcome of Prostate Cancer Patients with Germline DNA Repair Mutations: Retrospective Analysis from an International Study.', 'Survival of Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer After Disease Progression on an Androgen Receptor Axis-Targeted Therapy Given in the Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Versus Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Setting.', 'PROREPAIR-B: A Prospective Cohort Study of the Impact of Germline DNA Repair Mutations on the Outcomes of Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Identification of patients with metastatic castration-sensitive or metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer using administrative health claims and laboratory data.', 'Germline DNA-repair Gene Mutations and Efficacy of Abiraterone or Enzalutamide in Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Mismatch repair gene germline mutations in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Characteristics of BRCA2 Mutated Prostate Cancer at Presentation.', 'Prognostic Role of DNA Damage Response Genes Mutations and their Association With the Sensitivity of Olaparib in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Optical genome mapping identifies clinically relevant genomic rearrangements in prostate cancer biopsy sample.', 'Comprehensive analysis of DNA damage repair deficiency in 10,284 pan-cancer study.']"""

Although cancer patients initially respond to paclitaxel chemotherapy following surgery, most patients will relapse after 12-24 months and gradually die from chemotherapy resistance. In OC, cancer cells become resistant to paclitaxel chemotherapy under hypoxic environment. The miR-27a has been identified as an oncogenic molecular in ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, liver cancer etc. In addition, the miR-27a is involved in hypoxia-induced chemoresistance in various cancers. However, the role of miR-27a in hypoxia-induced OC resistance remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the regulatory mechanism of miR-27a in hypoxia-induced OC resistance. The expression of HIF-1α induced Hypoxia overtly up-regulated. At the same time, hypoxia increased viability of Skov3 cells and decreased cell apoptosis when treated with paclitaxel. The expression of the miR-27a was obviously up-regulated under hypoxia and involved in hypoxia-induced paclitaxel resistance. Follow-up experiments portray that miR-27a improved paclitaxel resistance by restraining the expression of APAF1 in OC. Finally, we further elucidated the important regulatory role of the miR-27a-APAF1 axis in OC through in vivo experiments. According to our knowledge, we first reported the regulation of miR-27a in hypoxia-induced chemoresistance in OC, providing a possible target for chemoresistance treatment of OC.""","""['Lanlan Feng', 'Fangrong Shen', 'Jinhua Zhou', 'Yan Li', 'Rong Jiang', 'Youguo Chen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Biosci Rep""","""['Hypoxia induced paclitaxel resistance in human ovarian cancers via hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha.', 'UCA1 confers paclitaxel resistance to ovarian cancer through miR-129/ABCB1 axis.', 'MicroRNA-630 inhibitor sensitizes chemoresistant ovarian cancer to chemotherapy by enhancing apoptosis.', 'ROS and miRNA Dysregulation in Ovarian Cancer Development, Angiogenesis and Therapeutic Resistance.', 'A comprehensive survey into the role of microRNAs in ovarian cancer chemoresistance; an updated overview.', 'Deregulated miRNA clusters in ovarian cancer: Imperative implications in personalized medicine.', 'Mir-675-5p supports hypoxia-induced drug resistance in colorectal cancer cells.', 'Hypoxia-Induced Intracellular and Extracellular Heat Shock Protein gp96 Increases Paclitaxel-Resistance and Facilitates Immune Evasion in Breast Cancer.', 'Characterizing Endocrine Status, Tumor Hypoxia and Immunogenicity for Therapy Success in Epithelial Ovarian Cancer.', 'Downregulation of HOXC6 by miR-27a ameliorates gefitinib resistance in non-small cell lung cancer.']"""

However, a PET/CT facility may not be affordable and/or accessible to remotely located health centers. Thus, economic considerations require development of a SPECT-based tracer to provide low cost effective health care to the entire global population. Hence, radiochemical parameters were varied and optimized to obtain the maximum radiochemical yield of 99mTc-PSMA-11. 99mTc-PSMA-11 could be prepared in 60 ± 5% radiochemical yield and >98% radiochemical purity with a specific activity of 15 ± 5 GBq μmol-1. The radiotracer exhibited high stability in vitro in human serum after 24 h. A cell uptake of 15.2 ± 1.2% was observed for 99mTc-PSMA-11 in PSMA-positive prostate carcinoma LNCaP cells. Rapid clearance from blood, liver, intestine, lungs and other major organs was observed during normal biodistribution studies. The radiotracer, 99mTc-PSMA-11, exhibited physiological distribution in salivary and lacrimal glands similar to that of 68Ga-PSMA-11 in mice and successfully identified primary tumors as well as metastatic lesions in human patients.

Chimeric chemical structures have been established as an important trend on medicinal chemistry in the last years. Thiazacridines are hybrid molecules composed of a thiazolidine and acridine nucleus, both pharmacophores that act on important biological targets for cancer. By the fact it is a serious disease, seven new 3-acridin-9-ylmethyl-thiazolidine-2,4-dione derivatives were synthesized, characterized, analyzed by computer simulation and tested in tumor cells. In order to find out if the compounds have therapeutic potential.  Materials and methods:   Seven new 3-acridin-9-ylmethyl-thiazolidine-2,4-dione derivatives were synthesized through Michael addition and Knoevenagel condensation strategies. Characterization was performed by NMR and Infrared spectroscopy techniques. Regarding biological activity, thiazacridines were tested against solid and hematopoietic tumoral cell lines, namely Jurkat (acute T-cell leukemia); HL-60 (acute promyelocytic leukemia); DU 145 (prostate cancer); MOLT-4 (acute lymphoblastic leukemia); RAJI (Burkitt's lymphoma); K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia) and normal cells PBMC (healthy volunteers). Molecular docking analysis was also performed in order to assess major targets of these new compounds. Cell cycle and clonogenic assay were also performed.  Results:   Compound LPSF/AA-62 (9f) exhibited the most potent anticancer activity against HL-60 (IC50 3,7±1,7 μM), MOLT-4 (IC50 5,7±1,1 μM), Jurkat (IC50 18,6 μM), Du-145 (IC50 20±5 μM) and Raji (IC50 52,3±9,2 μM). While the compound LPSF/AA-57 (9b) exhibited anticancer activity against the K562 cell line (IC50 51,8±7,8 μM). Derivative LPSF/AA-62 (9f) did not interfere in the cell cycle phases of the Molt-4 lineage. However, the LPSF/AA-62 (9f) derivative significantly reduced the formation of prostate cancer cell clones.

Methods:   A randomized trial comparing radical prostatectomy, active surveillance, external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy was performed from 2013 to 2016 and included 345 patients with low- and early intermediate-risk prostate cancer (ISUP grade groups 1 and 2).

Functional changes in prostate cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) coincide with alterations in DNA methylation levels at loci-specific regulatory regions. Yet, it is not clear how these methylation changes compare across CAFs from different patients. Therefore, we examined the consistency and prognostic significance of genome-wide DNA methylation profiles between CAFs from patients with different grades of primary prostate cancer.  Results:   We used Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChips to evaluate genome-wide DNA methylation profiles from 18 matched CAFs and non-malignant prostate tissue fibroblasts (NPFs) from men with moderate to high grade prostate cancer, as well as five unmatched benign prostate tissue fibroblasts (BPFs) from men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. We identified two sets of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in patient CAFs. One set of DMRs reproducibly differed between CAFs and fibroblasts from non-malignant tissue (NPFs and BPFs). Indeed, more than 1200 DMRs consistently changed in CAFs from every patient, regardless of tumour grade. The second set of DMRs varied between CAFs according to the severity of the tumour. Notably, hypomethylation of the EDARADD promoter occurred specifically in CAFs from high-grade tumours and correlated with increased transcript abundance and increased EDARADD staining in patient tissue. Across multiple cohorts, tumours with low EDARADD DNA methylation and high EDARADD mRNA expression were consistently associated with adverse clinical features and shorter recurrence free survival.  Conclusions:   We identified a large set of DMRs that are commonly shared across CAFs regardless of tumour grade and outcome, demonstrating highly consistent epigenome changes in the prostate tumour microenvironment. Additionally, we found that CAFs from aggressive prostate cancers have discrete methylation differences compared to CAFs from moderate risk prostate cancer. Together, our data demonstrates that the methylome of the tumour microenvironment reflects both the presence and the severity of the prostate cancer and, therefore, may provide diagnostic and prognostic potential.""","""['Mitchell G Lawrence', 'Ruth Pidsley', 'Birunthi Niranjan', 'Melissa Papargiris', 'Brooke A Pereira', 'Michelle Richards', 'Linda Teng', 'Sam Norden', 'Andrew Ryan', 'Mark Frydenberg', 'Clare Stirzaker', 'Renea A Taylor', 'Gail P Risbridger', 'Susan J Clark']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Epigenetics""","""['A bioengineered microenvironment to quantitatively measure the tumorigenic properties of cancer-associated fibroblasts in human prostate cancer.', 'Enduring epigenetic landmarks define the cancer microenvironment.', 'A distinct repertoire of cancer-associated fibroblasts is enriched in cribriform prostate cancer.', 'The expanding role of epigenetics in the development, diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Metabolic Reprogramming of Cancer Associated Fibroblasts: The Slavery of Stromal Fibroblasts.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblasts: from basic science to anticancer therapy.', 'Epigenetic regulation of cancer-associated fibroblast heterogeneity.', 'Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies Multiple Susceptibility Loci for Malignant Neoplasms of the Brain in Taiwan.', 'Patterns of indolence in prostate cancer (Review).', 'New Insights and Emerging Therapeutic Approaches in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Therefore, we developed a multifunctional enzalutamide-loaded graphene oxide nanosystem (TP-GQDss/Enz) for CRPC intravenous treatment, with high drug loading efficiency.  Methods:   Aminated graphene quantum dots (GQDs) were first cross-linked via disulfide bonds into a graphene quantum dot derivative of approximately 200 nm (GQDss), which was further functionalized with a tumour-targeting peptide and PEG to form TP-GQDss. Enz was loaded into TP-GQDss for in vitro and in vivo study.  Results:   The results showed that high drug-loading efficiency was achieved by TP-GQDss via π-π electron interaction.

The present study aimed to examine the outcomes of continence rates (CRs) and determine the risk and protective factors of urinary continence in patients with prostate cancer (PCa) undergoing RARP.  Methods:   This retrospective study included 650 patients treated with RARP with perioperative data and at least one year of follow-up from September 2009 to November 2017. Also, the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative parameters of the patients were analyzed. Continence was defined as no pad use. Early and late continence was defined as the return of urinary continence within 3 months and beyond 12 months post-surgery, respectively. CRs were examined from 1 to 48 months postoperatively. Logistic regression analysis evaluated the association between the predictive factors and urinary continence in the early and late stages.  Results:   No significant difference was detected in the CR from 12 to 48 months postoperatively (P = 0.766). Logistic regression analysis proved that pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) was a significant risk factor of urinary continence at 1 month. Nerve-sparing (NS) was a significant protective factor of urinary continence at 1, 3, and 6 months. Advanced age was an independent risk factor of urinary continence at 6, 12, and 24 months. Other variables were not statistically significant predictors of urinary continence.  Conclusions:   The current results demonstrated that CR gradually improved with time within 1 year and stabilized 1 year after the surgery.

However, the regulation and function of AR-V7 at levels of post-translational modifications in prostate cancer therapy remain poorly understood. Here, we conducted a library screen of natural products to identify potential small molecules responsible for AR-V7 protein degradation in human prostate cancer cell lines. Methods: A natural product library was used to screen the inhibitor of AR-V7. Co-IP and biomass spectrum assays were used to identify the AR-V7-interacting proteins, whereas western blot, confocal microscopy, RNA interfering, and gene transfection were used to validate these interactions. Cell viability, EDU staining, and colony formation assays were employed to detect cell growth and proliferation. Flowcytometry assays were used to detect the distribution of cell cycle. Mouse xenograft models were used to study the anti-CRPC effects in vivo. Results: This screen identified rutaecarpine, one of the major components of the Chinese medicine Evodia rutaecarpa, as a novel chemical that selectively induces AR-V7 protein degradation via K48-linked ubiquitination. Mechanically, this effect relies on rutaecarpine inducing the formation of a GRP78-AR-V7 protein complex, which further recruits the E3 ligase SIAH2 to directly promote the ubiquitination of AR-V7. Consequently, the genetic and pharmacological activation of the GRP78-dependent AR-V7 protein degradation restores the sensitivity of castration-resistant prostate cancer to anti-androgen therapy in cell culture and animal models.

However, the precise impact of innervation on PCa cells is still poorly understood. By focusing on muscarinic receptors, which are activated by the nerve-derived neurotransmitter acetylcholine, we show that muscarinic receptors 1 and 3 (m1 and m3) are highly expressed in PCa clinical specimens compared with all other cancer types, and that amplification or gain of their corresponding encoding genes (CHRM1 and CHRM3, respectively) represent a worse prognostic factor for PCa progression free survival. Moreover, m1 and m3 gene gain or amplification is frequent in castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) compared with hormone-sensitive PCa (HSPC) specimens. This was reflected in HSPC-derived cells, which show aberrantly high expression of m1 and m3 under androgen deprivation mimicking castration and androgen receptor inhibition. We also show that pharmacological activation of m1 and m3 signaling is sufficient to induce the castration-resistant growth of PCa cells. Mechanistically, we found that m1 and m3 stimulation induces YAP activation through FAK, whose encoding gene, PTK2 is frequently amplified in CRPC cases.

Membrane metalloendopeptidase (MME) is responsible for the catalytic inactivation of neuropeptide substrates, and is downregulated in nearly 50% of prostate cancers. However its role in prostate carcinogenesis, including formation of castration-resistant prostate carcinomas, remains uncertain. Here we report that MME cooperates with PTEN in suppression of carcinogenesis by controlling activities of prostate stem/progenitor cells. Lack of MME and PTEN results in development of adenocarcinomas characterized by propensity for vascular invasion and formation of proliferative neuroendocrine clusters after castration. Effects of MME on prostate stem/progenitor cells depend on its catalytic activity and can be recapitulated by addition of the MME substrate, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP). Knockdown or inhibition of GRP receptor (GRPR) abrogate effects of MME deficiency and delay growth of human prostate cancer xenografts by reducing the number of cancer-propagating cells. In sum, our study provides a definitive proof of tumor-suppressive role of MME, links GRP/GRPR signaling to the control of prostate stem/progenitor cells, and shows how dysregulation of such signaling may promote formation of castration-resistant prostate carcinomas.

Such a secretory phenotype occurs in response to cell stress and cancer therapeutics. HSPs are stress-responsive molecular chaperones promoting proper protein folding, while also being released from cells with EVs as well as a soluble form known as alarmins. We have here investigated the secretory phenotype of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells using proteome analysis. We have also examined the roles of the key co-chaperone CDC37 in the release of EV proteins including CD9 and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key event in tumor progression. EVs derived from CRPC cells promoted EMT in normal prostate epithelial cells. Some HSP family members and their potential receptor CD91/LRP1 were enriched at high levels in CRPC cell-derived EVs among over 700 other protein types found by mass spectrometry. The small EVs (30-200 nm in size) were released even in a non-heated condition from the prostate cancer cells, whereas the EMT-coupled release of EVs (200-500 nm) and damaged membrane vesicles with associated HSP90α was increased after heat shock stress (HSS). GAPDH and lactate dehydrogenase, a marker of membrane leakage/damage, were also found in conditioned media upon HSS. During this stress response, the intracellular chaperone CDC37 was transcriptionally induced by heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), which activated the CDC37 core promoter, containing an interspecies conserved heat shock element. In contrast, knockdown of CDC37 decreased EMT-coupled release of CD9-containing vesicles. Triple siRNA targeting CDC37, HSP90α, and HSP90β was required for efficient reduction of this chaperone trio and to reduce tumorigenicity of the CRPC cells in vivo. Taken together, we define ""stressome"" as cellular stress-induced all secretion products, including EVs (200-500 nm), membrane-damaged vesicles and remnants, and extracellular HSP90 and GAPDH.

The human vasoactive neuropeptide urotensin II (hUII), which shares structural analogies with somatostatin, interacts with a single high affinity GPCR named UT. High expression of UT has been reported in several types of human solid tumours from lung, gut, prostate, or breast, suggesting that UT is a valuable novel target to design radiolabelled hUII analogues for cancer diagnosis. In this study, two original urotensinergic analogues were first conjugated to a DOTA chelator via an aminohexanoic acid (Ahx) hydrocarbon linker and then -hUII and DOTA-urantide, complexed to the radioactive metal indium isotope to successfully lead to radiolabelled DOTA-Ahx-hUII and DOTA-Ahx-urantide. The 111In-DOTA-hUII in human plasma revealed that only 30% of the radioligand was degraded after a 3-h period. DOTA-hUII and DOTA-urantide exhibited similar binding affinities as native peptides and relayed calcium mobilization in HEK293 cells expressing recombinant human UT. DOTA-hUII, not DOTA-urantide, was able to promote UT internalization in UT-expressing HEK293 cells, thus indicating that radiolabelled 111In-DOTA-hUII would allow sufficient retention of radioactivity within tumour cells or radiolabelled DOTA-urantide may lead to a persistent binding on UT at the plasma membrane. The potential of these radioligands as candidates to target UT was investigated in adenocarcinoma. We showed that hUII stimulated the migration and proliferation of both human lung A549 and colorectal DLD-1 adenocarcinoma cell lines endogenously expressing UT. In vivo intravenous injection of 111In-DOTA-hUII in C57BL/6 mice revealed modest organ signals, with important retention in kidney. 111In-DOTA-hUII or 111In-DOTA-urantide were also injected in nude mice bearing heterotopic xenografts of lung A549 cells or colorectal DLD-1 cells both expressing UT. The observed significant renal uptake and low tumour/muscle ratio (around 2.5) suggest fast tracer clearance from the organism. Together, DOTA-hUII and DOTA-urantide were successfully radiolabelled with 111Indium, the first one functioning as a UT agonist and the second one as a UT-biased ligand/antagonist. To allow tumour-specific targeting and prolong body distribution in preclinical models bearing some solid tumours, these radiolabelled urotensinergic analogues should be optimized for being used as potential molecular tools for diagnosis imaging or even treatment tools.""","""['Benjamin Poret', 'Laurence Desrues', 'Marc-André Bonin', 'Martin Pédard', 'Martine Dubois', 'Richard Leduc', 'Romain Modzelewski', 'Pierre Decazes', 'Fabrice Morin', 'Pierre Vera', 'Hélène Castel', 'Pierre Bohn', 'Pierrick Gandolfo']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Biomolecules""","""['Imaging of EGFR expression in murine xenografts using site-specifically labelled anti-EGFR 111In-DOTA-Z EGFR:2377 Affibody molecule: aspect of the injected tracer amount.', 'Stabilised 111In-labelled DTPA- and DOTA-conjugated neurotensin analogues for imaging and therapy of exocrine pancreatic cancer.', 'The peptidic urotensin-II receptor ligand GSK248451 possesses less intrinsic activity than the low-efficacy partial agonists SB-710411 and urantide in native mammalian tissues and recombinant cell systems.', 'Urantide mimics urotensin-II induced calcium release in cells expressing recombinant UT receptors.', 'Treatment of advanced neuroendocrine tumours with radiolabelled somatostatin analogues.', 'Radionuclide-based theranostics - a promising strategy for lung cancer.', 'Novel Approaches in Biomolecule Labeling.', 'Targeting the Urotensin II/UT G Protein-Coupled Receptor to Counteract Angiogenesis and Mesenchymal Hypoxia/Necrosis in Glioblastoma.']"""

Methods:   We apply an unsupervised model called Latent Process Decomposition (LPD), which can handle heterogeneity within individual cancer samples, to genome-wide expression data from eight prostate cancer clinical series, including 1,785 malignant samples with the clinical endpoints of PSA failure and metastasis.  Results:   We show that PSA failure is correlated with the level of an expression signature called DESNT (HR = 1.52, 95% CI = [1.36, 1.7], P = 9.0 × 10-14, Cox model), and that patients with a majority DESNT signature have an increased metastatic risk (X2 test, P = 0.0017, and P = 0.0019). In addition, we develop a stratification framework that incorporates DESNT and identifies three novel molecular subtypes of prostate cancer.

Tumor cells secrete PD-L1 through exosomes or splice variants, which has been described as a new mechanism for the resistance to PD-L1 blockade therapy in multiple cancers, including PCa. This suggests that cutting off the secretion or expression of PD-L1 might improve the response rate of PD-L1 blockade therapy in PCa treatment. Here we report that p300/CBP inhibition by a small molecule p300/CBP inhibitor dramatically enhanced the efficacy of PD-L1 blockade treatment in a syngeneic model of PCa by blocking both the intrinsic and IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 expression. Mechanistically, p300/CBP could be recruited to the promoter of CD274 (encoding PD-L1) by the transcription factor IRF-1, which induced the acetylation of Histone H3 at CD274 promoter followed by the transcription of CD274. A485, a p300/CBP inhibitor, abrogated this process and cut off the secretion of exosomal PD-L1 by blocking the transcription of CD274, which combined with the anti-PD-L1 antibody to reactivate T cells function for tumor attack.

Methods:   Within the National Inpatient Sample database, we identified 91,618 RP patients treated between 2008 and 2015. The Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups frailty-defining indicator was applied, and we examined the rates of frailty over time, as well as its effect on overall complications, major complications, nonhome-based discharge, length of stay (LOS), and total hospital charges (THCs). Time trends and multivariable logistic, Poisson and linear regression models were applied.  Results:   Overall, 12,185 (13.3%) patients were frail. Rates of frail patients increased over time (from 10.3 to 18.2%; p < 0.001). Frail patients had higher rates of overall complications (16.6 vs. 8.6%), major complications (4.9 vs. 2.6%), nonhome-based discharge (5.9 vs. 5%), longer LOS (2 vs. 1), and higher THCs ($37,186 vs. $35,241) (all p < 0.001). Moreover, frailty was an independent predictor of overall complications (OR: 1.95), major complications (OR: 1.76), nonhome-based discharge (OR: 1.20), longer LOS (RR: 1.19), and higher THCs (RR: $3160) (all p < 0.001). Of frail patients, 10,418 (85.5%) neither exhibited body mass index ≥ 30 nor Charlson comorbidity index ≥ 2.

We evaluated plasma circulating tumor DNA- (ctDNA-) based copy number alterations (CNAs) to determine treatment-related predictive and prognostic biomarkers for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Methods:   Serial plasma specimens were prospectively collected from 88 chemotherapy-naive mCRPC patients before and after 12 weeks of AA/P treatment. Sequencing-based CNA analyses were performed on 174 specimens. We evaluated CNA-associated 12-week responses for primary resistance, time to treatment change (TTTC) for secondary resistance, and overall survival for prognosis (P < 0.05). Associations with primary resistance were analyzed using the Fisher exact test. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression analyses were used to determine the associations of CNAs with acquired resistance and overall survival.  Results:   ctDNA reduced by 3.89% in responders and increased by 0.94% in nonresponders (P = 0.0043). Thirty-one prostate cancer-related genes from whole genome CNAs were tested.

Epidemiological and pre-clinical evidence support an association between statin use and delayed prostate cancer (PCa) progression. Here, we evaluated the effects of neoadjuvant fluvastatin treatment on markers of cell proliferation and apoptosis in men with localized PCa.  Methods:   Thirty-three men were treated daily with 80 mg fluvastatin for 4-12 weeks in a single-arm window-of-opportunity study between diagnosis of localized PCa and radical prostatectomy (RP) (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01992042). Percent Ki67 and cleaved Caspase-3 (CC3)-positive cells in tumor tissues were evaluated in 23 patients by immunohistochemistry before and after treatment. Serum and intraprostatic fluvastatin concentrations were quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.  Results:   Baseline characteristics included a median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 6.48 ng/mL (IQR: 4.21-10.33). The median duration of fluvastatin treatment was 49 days (range: 27-102). Median serum low-density lipoprotein levels decreased by 35% after treatment, indicating patient compliance. Median PSA decreased by 12%, but this was not statistically significant in our small cohort. The mean fluvastatin concentration measured in the serum was 0.2 μM (range: 0.0-1.1 μM), and in prostatic tissue was 8.5 nM (range: 0.0-77.0 nM). At these concentrations, fluvastatin induced PCa cell death in vitro in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In patients, fluvastatin treatment did not significantly alter intratumoral Ki67 positivity; however, a median 2.7-fold increase in CC3 positivity (95% CI: 1.9-5.0, p = 0.007) was observed in post-fluvastatin RP tissues compared with matched pre-treatment biopsy controls. In a subset analysis, this increase in CC3 was more pronounced in men on fluvastatin for >50 days.

However, very few studies evaluated the association of variations in DNA damage response genes and treatment outcomes and toxicity in brachytherapy-treated patients.  Purpose:   To evaluate the association of inherited germline variations in DNA repair-associated genes with tumor control and treatment toxicity in patients treated with low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy (LDRB).  Material and methods:   The cohort consists of 475 I-125 LDRB patients with a median follow-up of 51 months after seed implantation. Patients were genotyped for 215 haplotype tagging single nucleotide variations (htSNPs) in 29 candidate genes of DNA damage response and repair pathways. Their association with biochemical recurrence (BCR) was assessed using Cox regression models and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Linear regressions and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) between early and late International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) with htSNPs were used to evaluate the association with urinary toxicity.  Results:   After adjustment for the established risk factors, six htSNPs in five genes were found to be significantly associated with an altered risk of BCR, with adjusted hazard ratios (HRadj. ) ranging between 3.6 and 11.1 (P < .05). Compared to carriers of the ERCC3 rs4150499C allele, patients homozygous for the T allele (n = 22) had a significant higher risk of BCR with a HR of 11.13 (IC95 = 3.9-32.0; P < .0001; q < 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier survival curve revealed a mean BCR-free survival time reduced from 213 ± 7 to 99 ± 12 months (log-rank P < .0001) for homozygous T carriers compare to noncarriers. For late IPSS (>6 months after treatment), htSNP rs6544990 from MSH2 showed a statistically significant b-coefficient of 1.85 ± 0.52 (P < .001; q < 0.1). Homozygous carriers of the MSH2 rs6544990C allele (n = 62) had a mean late IPSS 3.6 points higher than patients homozygous for the A allele (n = 132). This difference was significant when tested by ANCOVA using pretreatment IPSS as a covariate (P < .01).  Conclusions:   This study suggests an association of the intronic variants of the DNA nucleotide excision repair ERCC3 and DNA mismatch repair MSH2 genes with elevated risk of BCR and late urinary toxicity respectively after LDRB.

However, it is challenging to locate the prostatic urethra in planning computed tomography (pCT). In the present study, we developed a multiatlas-based auto-segmentation method for prostatic urethra identification using deformable image registration accuracy prediction with machine learning (ML) and assessed its feasibility.  Methods:   We examined 120 patients with prostate cancer treated with IMRT. All patients underwent temporary urinary catheter placement for identification and contouring of the prostatic urethra in pCT images (ground truth). Our method comprises the following three steps: (a) select four atlas datasets from the atlas datasets using the deformable image registration (DIR) accuracy prediction model, (b) deform them by structure-based DIR, (3) and propagate urethra contour using displacement vector field calculated by the DIR. In (a), for identifying suitable datasets, we used the trained support vector machine regression (SVR) model and five feature descriptors (e.g., prostate volume) to increase DIR accuracy. This method was trained/validated using 100 patients and performance was evaluated within an independent test set of 20 patients. Fivefold cross-validation was used to optimize the hype parameters of the DIR accuracy prediction model. We assessed the accuracy of our method by comparing it with those of two others: Acostas method-based patient selection (previous study method, by Acosta et al.), and the Waterman's method (defines the prostatic urethra based on the center of the prostate, by Waterman et al.). We used the centerlines distance (CLD) between the ground truth and the predicted prostatic urethra as the evaluation index.  Results:   The CLD in the entire prostatic urethra was 2.09 ± 0.89 mm (our proposed method), 2.77 ± 0.99 mm (Acosta et al., P = 0.022), and 3.47 ± 1.19 mm (Waterman et al., P < 0.001); our proposed method showed the highest accuracy. In segmented CLD, CLD in the top 1/3 segment was highly improved from that of Waterman et.al. and was slightly improved from that of Acosta et.al., with results of 2.49 ± 1.78 mm (our proposed method), 2.95 ± 1.75 mm (Acosta et al., P = 0.42), and 5.76 ± 3.09 mm (Waterman et al., P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   We developed a DIR accuracy prediction model-based multiatlas-based auto-segmentation method for prostatic urethra identification. Our method identified prostatic urethra with mean error of 2.09 mm, likely due to combined effects of SVR model employment in patient selection, modified atlas dataset characteristics and DIR algorithm.

Studies have reported that PSCA expression is generally high in prostate cancer, which correlates with a worse survival. PSCA is also highly expressed in bladder, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers. However, PSCA is expressed at low levels in gastric, gallbladder and oesophageal cancers. At present, the clinical significance, expression pattern and biological function of PSCA in gastric cancer (GC) are still unclear. Methods: Previously, we used cDNA microarray as a screening tool to compare GC tissues with its matched normal gastric mucosa tissues (MNGT), and obtained the differentially expressed genes of the two tissue types. PSCA is one of the genes significantly down-regulated in GC tissues. In this study, we detected the expression of PSCA in GC tissues and MNGT by western-blot experiment and immunohistochemical staining (IHC). Then the relationship between the expression pattern of PSCA and the clinicopathological characteristics and survival in GC was analyzed. In order to further study the function of PSCA in GC, lentivirus was used to construct stable cell lines with knockdown and overexpression of PSCA gene. We used AGS and MKN45 cell lines for plasmid transfection. Colony formation assay, MTS and nude mice xenograft model were performed to investigate the effect of PSCA in GC. Results: Western-blot and IHC assays demonstrated that the expression of PSCA in GC tissues was significantly lower than that in the MNGT. PSCA expression in GC tissues was high in 252 (57.5%) and low in 186 (42.5%) of 438 patients. PSCA expression for MNGT was high in 273 (62.3%) and low in 165 (37.7%) of 438 patients. PSCA expression was significantly associated with T classification (P=0.024), N classification (P=0.018) and TNM stage (P=0.019) using χ2 test. The relationship between PSCA expression level and patient survival was analysed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test. Low levels of PSCA expression were significantly associated with a poorer OS than high expression levels of PSCA (P=0.011). In the COX regression analysis of OS, all 9 variables in the univariate analysis were significantly correlated with OS (P<0.05), while the variables found to be independently correlated with OS in the multivariate analysis were PSCA expression (P=0.036), age (P<0.001), gender (P=0.007), and TNM stage (P<0.001), respectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that PSCA was an independent prognostic factor for OS in GC. In vitro MTS cell proliferation experiment and clonal formation experiment and in vivo nude mouse subcutaneous tumorigenesis experiment all proved that knockdown of PSCA gene can improve the proliferation ability of GC cells, while in vitro experiment proved that overexpression of PSCA can reduce the proliferation ability of GC cells.It was found that knockdown of PSCA gene can improve the proliferation ability of GC cells both in vitro and in vivo, while overexpression of PSCA can reduce the proliferation ability of GC cells in vitro. Conclusion: Our study showed that the expression of PSCA gene was decreased in GC, which was related to more advanced pathological stages. And the expression level of PSCA in GC was an independent good prognostic factor.

The distances between the 3 EMTs (apex to left, left to right, right to apex) and the isocenter were calculated both on planning computed tomography (CT) and cone beam CT (CBCT) at the first treatment fraction and compared with data reported by Calypso. EMT position and treatment interruptions triggered by Calypso were analyzed for all evaluable treatment fractions (n = 120). Localization accuracy was quantified by recording the geometric residual value (expected limit ≤0.2 cm) at the RT setup.  Results:   The Calypso system was able to localize and track prostate position without any detectable interference from MHP. For every treatment fraction, the agreement between the CBCT images and Calypso guidance was optimal, with EMTs always within the defined tolerance (ie, CT-Calypso or CBCT-Calypso measured differences in inter-EMT distances within 0.3 cm). EMT to isocenter distances measured by Calypso reproduced CT data and were confirmed on CBCT scans. During RT, the EMT centroid exceeded the threshold 24 times (20% of all fractions): 5 times in the left-right, 15 times in the anteroposterior, and 4 times in the superoinferior directions. The largest motions recorded were in the anteroposterior axis: 0.6 cm anteriorly and 0.5 cm posteriorly in patients with unilateral and bilateral MHP, respectively.  Conclusions:   Our study represents the first clinical experience assessing the localization and tracking accuracy of Calypso EMTs during curative RT of patients with PCa with unilateral or bilateral MHP.""","""['Marta Bottero', 'Giovanna Dipasquale', 'Andrea Lancia', 'Raymond Miralbell', 'Maud Jaccard', 'Thomas Zilli']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Effect of metal hip prosthesis on the accuracy of electromagnetic localization tracking.', 'Evaluation of multiple image-based modalities for image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) of prostate carcinoma: a prospective study.', 'Target localization and real-time tracking using the Calypso 4D localization system in patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'A comparison of radiographic techniques and electromagnetic transponders for localization of the prostate.', 'Can bronchoscopically implanted anchored electromagnetic transponders be used to monitor tumor position and lung inflation during deep inspiration breath-hold lung radiotherapy?', 'Practical considerations for prostate hypofractionation in the developing world.']"""

Then we explored gene expression signature-based strategies using a connectivity map database and identified several STAT3 inhibitors, including ethacrynic acid (EA). EA is currently used as a diuretic drug. EA inhibited STAT3 activation in DU145 prostate cancer cells and consequently decreased the levels of STAT3 target genes such as cyclin A and MCL-1. Furthermore, EA treatment inhibited tumor growth in mice xenografted with DU145 cells and decreased p-STAT3 expression in tumor tissues. Knockdown of Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-2 (SHP2) or Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) gene expression by siRNA suppressed the ability of EA to inhibit STAT3 activation. When EA was combined with an activator of SHP2 or PTP1B, p-STAT3 expression was synergistically decreased; when EA was combined with an inhibitor of SHP2 or PTP1B, p-STAT3 expression was rescued. By using an affinity pulldown assay with biotinyl-EA, EA was shown to associate with SHP2 and PTP1B in vitro. Additionally, the drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) assay confirmed the direct binding of EA to SHP2 and PTP1B. SHP2 is activated by EA through active phosphorylation at Y580 and direct binding to SHP2. Collectively, our results suggest that EA inhibits STAT3 activity through the modulation of phosphatases such as SHP2 and PTP1B and may be a potential anticancer drug to target STAT3 in cancer progression.""","""['Yu-Jin Lee', 'Harim Song', 'Yae Jin Yoon', 'Seung-Jin Park', 'Seon-Young Kim', 'Dong Cho Han', 'Byoung-Mog Kwon']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Biochem Pharmacol""","""['Geranylnaringenin (CG902) inhibits constitutive and inducible STAT3 activation through the activation of SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase.', 'Sugiol inhibits STAT3 activity via regulation of transketolase and ROS-mediated ERK activation in DU145 prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Acacetin Inhibits the Growth of STAT3-Activated DU145 Prostate Cancer Cells by Directly Binding to Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3).', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases as Potential Regulators of STAT3 Signaling.', 'Double-edged roles of protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 in cancer and its inhibitors in clinical trials.', 'Sertindole, an Antipsychotic Drug, Curbs the STAT3/BCL-xL Axis to Elicit Human Bladder Cancer Cell Apoptosis In Vitro.', 'Ethacrynic Acid: A Promising Candidate for Drug Repurposing as an Anticancer Agent.', 'Uncovering the Inhibitory Molecular Mechanism of Pomegranate Peel to Urinary Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma Using Proteomics Techniques.', ""STAT3 and Its Pathways' Dysregulation-Underestimated Role in Urological Tumors."", 'Ethacrynic acid and cinnamic acid combination exhibits selective anticancer effects on K562 chronic myeloid leukemia cells.']"""

New image-guided RT techniques accuracy allows planning target volume (PTV) margins reduction. We aim to assess the feasibility of a kilovoltage intrafraction monitoring (KIM) to track the prostate during RT.  Methods and materials:   Between November 2017 and April 2018, 44 consecutive patients with PCa were included in an intrafraction prostate motion study using the Truebeam Auto Beam Hold® tracking system (Varian Medical Systems, United State) triggered by gold fiducials localization on kilovoltage (kV) imaging. A 5-mm PTV was considered. A significant gating event (SGE) was defined as the occurrence of an automatic beam interruption requiring patient repositioning following the detection of one fiducial outside a 5-mm target area around the marker during more than 45seconds.  Results:   Six patients could not benefit from the KIM because of technical issues (loss of one fiducial marker=1, hip prosthesis=4, morbid obesity causing table movements=1). The mean rate of SGE per patient was 14±19%, and the fraction average delivery time was increased by 146±86seconds. For a plan of 39 fractions of 2Gy, the additional radiation dose increased by 0.13±0.09Gy. The mean rates of SGE were 2% and 18% (P=0.002) in patients with planned fraction<90 and>90seconds respectively, showing that duration of the session strongly interfered with prostate intrafraction movements. No other significant clinical and technical parameter was correlated with the occurrence of SGE.  Conclusion:   Automated intrafraction kV imaging can effectively perform autobeam holds due to intrafraction movement of the prostate in the large majority of patients. The additional radiation dose and delivery time are acceptable. This technique may be a cost-effective alternative to electromagnetic transponder guidance.""","""['M Chasseray', 'G Dissaux', 'F Lucia', 'N Boussion', 'G Goasduff', 'O Pradier', 'V Bourbonne', 'U Schick']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Radiother""","""['Utilizing the TrueBeam Advanced Imaging Package to monitor intrafraction motion with periodic kV imaging and automatic marker detection during VMAT prostate treatments.', 'Inter- and intrafraction uncertainty in prostate bed image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Real-Time 3D Image Guidance Using a Standard LINAC: Measured Motion, Accuracy, and Precision of the First Prospective Clinical Trial of Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring-Guided Gating for Prostate Cancer Radiation Therapy.', 'Clinical to planning target volume margins in prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'ESTRO ACROP consensus guideline on the use of image guided radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Intrafraction motion during CyberKnife® prostate SBRT: impact of imaging frequency and patient factors.', 'GI factors, potential to predict prostate motion during radiotherapy; a scoping review.', 'Implementation of triggered kilovoltage imaging for stereotactic radiotherapy of the spine for patients with spinal fixation hardware.', 'Triggered kV Imaging During Spine SBRT for Intrafraction Motion Management.']"""

MATERIAL AND METHODS We collected information on patients undergoing prostate biopsy from January 2015 to December 2018 from their medical records, including clinical characteristics and laboratory test results. Finally, after strict screening, the prediction model was established in 440 patients who underwent a transrectal prostate biopsy (TRPB). We divided these patients into a training group and validation group at a ratio of 7: 3, respectively. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to select the predictors and to develop the model. Calibration curve and C-index were used to evaluate the accuracy of the nomogram, while DCA was used to assess the clinical value. RESULTS The individualized predictive nomogram contained 3 clinical features - Biopsy-positive rate (BPR), Hematuria, and Urine WBC - significantly associated with post-biopsy fever. The nomogram had good discriminating ability in both the training group and validation group - the C-index was 0.774 (95% CI=0.717-0.832) in the training group and 0.808 (95% CI=0.706-0.909) in the validation group. Hosmer-Lemeshow test proved a good calibration curve fit. The DCA curve suggested that the nomogram would have good clinical utility.

This study examined the relationship between polypharmacy and inpatient hospitalization among older adults with cancer treated with intravenous (IV) chemotherapy.  Materials and methods:   The main data source was the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked files. Patients (≥65 years) were included if they were diagnosed with prostate (n = 1430), breast (n = 5490), or lung cancer (n = 7309) in 1991-2013 and received IV chemotherapy in 2011-2014. The number of medications during the six-month window pre-IV chemotherapy initiation determined polypharmacy status. Negative binomial models were used to assess the association between polypharmacy and post-chemotherapy inpatient hospitalization. The results were presented as incidence rate ratios.  Results:   We identified 13,959 patients with prostate, breast, or lung cancer treated with IV chemotherapy. The median number of prescription medications during the six-month window pre-IV chemotherapy initiation was high: ten among patients with prostate cancer, nine among patients with breast cancer, and eleven among patients with lung cancer. Compared to patients taking <5 prescriptions, post-chemotherapy hospitalization rate for patients with prostate cancer was 42%, 75%, and 114% higher among those taking 5-9, 10-14, and 15+ medications, respectively. Patients with breast and lung cancer demonstrated similar patterns.  Conclusion:   This large population-based study found that polypharmacy during the six-month window pre-IV chemotherapy is highly predictive of post-chemotherapy inpatient hospitalization.

Therefore, we evaluated the anti-tumor activity of our synthetic compounds on different cancer cells including human malignant melanoma cells (A375), prostate cancer cells (PC3 cells, LNCaP cells) and normal cells HDF (human dermal fibroblast). Notably, we found that compound 4b that contains a nitro group has the best anti-tumor activity on three different cancer cells. By using DAPI staining, we showed cancer cells death. Apoptosis induction was shown using quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) by evaluating of Bax and Bcl2 mRNA levels.

Bromodomain and extra terminal domain (BET) protein BRD4 binds to super-enhancers (SEs) that drive high expression of oncogenes in many cancers. A BET inhibitor, JQ1, has been found to suppress the malignant phenotypes of prostate cancer cells, however, the target genes of JQ1 remain largely unknown. Here we show that SE-associated genes specific for AR-negative CRPC PC3 cells include genes involved in migration and invasion, and that JQ1 impairs migration and invasion of PC3 cells. We identified a long non-coding RNA, MANCR, which was markedly down-regulated by JQ1, and found that BRD4 binds to the MANCR locus.

Treatment regimens between lower-grade (GS ≤7) and high-grade (GS >7) PCa differ largely and have great effects on cancer progression.  Purpose:   To investigate the use of different sequences in biparametric MRI (bpMRI) of the prostate gland for noninvasively distinguishing high-grade PCa.  Study type:   Retrospective.  Population:   In all, 489 patients (training cohort: N = 326; test cohort: N = 163) with PCa between June 2008 and January 2018.  Field strength/sequence:   3.0T, pelvic phased-array coils, bpMRI including T2 -weighted imaging (T2 WI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI); apparent diffusion coefficient map extracted from DWI.  Assessment:   The whole prostate gland was delineated. Radiomic features were extracted and selected using the Kruskal-Wallis test, the minimum redundancy-maximum relevance, and the sequential backward elimination algorithm. Two single-sequence radiomic (T2 WI, DWI) and two combined (T2 WI-DWI, T2 WI-DWI-Clinic) models were respectively constructed and validated via logistic regression.  Statistical tests:   The Kruskal-Wallis test and chi-squared test were utilized to evaluate the differences among variable groups. P < 0.05 determined statistical significance. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy were used to evaluate model performance. The Delong test was conducted to compare the differences between the AUCs of all models.  Result:   All radiomic models showed significant (P < 0.001) predictive performances. Between the single-sequence radiomic models, the DWI model achieved the most encouraging results, with AUCs of 0.801 and 0.787 in the training and test cohorts, respectively. For the combined models, the T2 WI-DWI models acquired an AUC of 0.788, which was almost the same with DWI in the test cohort, and no significant difference was found between them (training cohort: P = 0.199; test cohort: P = 0.924).  Data conclusion:   Radiomics based on bpMRI can noninvasively identify high-grade PCa before the operation, which is helpful for individualized diagnosis of PCa.

Methods:   Prostate cancer survivors ages ≥40 years were identified from the 2004-2014 Pennsylvania Cancer Registry (PCR). Demographic/clinical descriptors and PC treatment were extracted from PCR. Prostate cancer aggressiveness was defined by clinical/pathologic Gleason score and tumor stage. Logistic and Cox regression analyses tested associations between treatment received and PC-specific mortality. County-level data from the Pennsylvania BRFSS were used to estimate cancer-related behavioral risk factors (eg, smoking, physical inactivity, fruit/vegetable consumption [FV], alcohol use) and used as covariates.  Results:   There were 90 694 PCS ages 40-105 years (mean age = 66.19 years, SD = 9.25) included. Most were non-Hispanic white men (83%). Prostate cancer survivors ≥75 years were least likely to receive any treatment but men ages 65-74 were more likely to receive combined therapies (OR = 1.47; 95% CI 1.28, 1.69) vs PCS ages 40-54 years, controlling for covariates. Prostate cancer survivors 55-75+ with aggressive PC who received any treatment vs no definitive treatment had significantly reduced mortality. Men from counties with high obesity and smoking rates were significantly less likely to receive any treatment than men living in counties with lower rates of these risk factors. Prostate cancer survivors who lived in counties with high rates of physical inactivity and had high rates of sufficient FV consumption were slightly more likely to receive cancer treatment vs no definitive treatment compared to men who lived in counties with high rates of physical activity and lower FV consumption.  Conclusions:   We observed a general age-related decline in receipt of treatment. Prostate cancer survivors ages ≥75 years were significantly less likely to get any cancer treatment compared to younger PCS. However, most men with more aggressive disease who received any treatment had greatly reduced PC mortality, regardless of age.

Methods:   This study included 117 prospectively accrued active surveillance patients who underwent prostate MRI both without (prep-) and with bowel preparation consisting of FE (prep+) obtained within 12 months of each other. The anterior-posterior (AP) diameter of the rectum, degree of perceived distention in the rectum and image quality scores were assessed by two independent readers for both (prep- and prep+) scans. DWI distortion was assessed quantitatively using the degree of anatomic mismatches between images obtained at different b values and the T2-weighted MRI. DWI artifact was qualitatively scored based on the presence of blurring, poor signal-to-noise, and artifact lines. The difference in rectal AP diameters between the two methods was tested by the paired Wilcoxon rank test. Stuart Maxell test was used in comparing rectal distention, DWI distortion, and artifact. Reader agreement was estimated by kappa statistics. p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.  Results:   Mean rectal AP diameter was significantly larger in prep- compared with prep+ scans (p = 0.002). Subjective scores demonstrated inter-reader variability. For instance, the rectal distention score was significantly lower in prep+ for reader 2 (p < 0.001) whereas it was not significant for reader 1 (p = 0.09). Reader 2 also found significant improvement in DWI distortion (p = 0.02) in prep+ scans. There was no significant difference between prep- and prep+ in DWI distortion and artifacts for reader 1 (p = 0.17 and p = 0.49, respectively), or DWI artifacts for reader 2 (p = 0.55). Kappa scores were moderate for rectal distension, but weak for DWI distortion, and artifacts.

Rectal dose reduction was evaluated using low-/middle-dose (D20%, D50% and D80%) and high-dose (D2%) ranges. Rectal dose reduction of each dose index was compared for each technique. Significant rectal dose reduction (P < 0.001) between the treatment plans on pre- and post-CT images were achieved for all modalities for D50%, D20% and D2%. In particular, the dose reduction of high-dose (D2%) ranges were -40.61 ± 11.19, -32.44 ± 5.51, -25.90 ± 9.89, -13.63 ± 8.27 and -8.06 ± 4.19%, for proton therapy, CK, HT, VMAT and 3DCRT, respectively.

The lack of effective therapies urges the development of novel therapeutic options against PC. Quercetin (Quer) is a flavonoid compound that has been shown to effectively inhibit PC in vitro and in vivo. However, the underlying mechanisms await elucidation. Long non-coding RNA MALAT1 has been reported as an oncogenic target in multiple types of cancers, including PC. Previous data showed that quercetin promoted the apoptosis of fibroblast-like synoviocytes by upregulating MALAT1 in rheumatoid arthritis. However, we speculate that mechanisms are different in PC.  Materials and methods:   Human PC cell line PC-3 and its xenograft tumor were chosen as in vitro and in vivo models for PC. A series of in vitro and in vivo functional experiments were carried out to elucidate the role of MALAT1 in quercetin treatment against PC. Western blot was performed to measure the expression of related proteins to explore underlying molecular mechanisms.  Results:   We showed for the first time that MALAT1 expression was significantly downregulated in quercetin-treated PC cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner.

In our previous study, a 3',5'-diprenylated chalcone, (E)-1-(2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-3,5-diprenyl) phenyl-3-(3-pyridinyl)-propene-1-one (C10), was identified as a novel anti-prostate cancer (PCa) agent. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-cancer effects of C10 on the growth, metastasis, and invasion of PC3 cells in vitro. Our results show that C10 exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on proliferation and metastasis of PC3 cells via several cellular and flow cytometric analyses. Further mechanism studies revealed that C10 likely serves as an Fli-1 agonist for regulating the expression of Fli-1 target genes including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (P110), murine double minute2 (MDM2), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Src homology-2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase 1 (SHIP-1), and globin transcription factor-1 (Gata-1) as well as the phosphorylation of extracellular-regulated protein kinases 1 (ERK1). Further, we confirmed that C10 can regulate the expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor 1 (VEGF-1), transforming growth factor-β2 (TGF-β2), intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), p53, and matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) genes associated with tumor apoptosis, migration, and invasion.

Digital health enables remote electronic PRO (ePRO) assessments as a clinical decision support tool to facilitate meaningful provider interactions and personalized treatment.  Objective:   This study explored the feasibility and acceptability of collecting ePROs using validated health-related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaires for prostate cancer.  Methods:   Using Apple ResearchKit software, the Strength Through Insight app was created with content from validated HRQoL tools 26-item Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) or EPIC for Clinical Practice and 8-item Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Advanced Prostate Symptom Index. In a single-arm pilot study with patients receiving prostate cancer treatment at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital and affiliates, participants were recruited, and instructed to download Strength Through Insight and complete ePROs once a week over 12 weeks. A mixed methods approach, including qualitative pre- and poststudy interviews, was used to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of Strength Through Insight for the collection and care management of cancer treatment.  Results:   Thirty patients consented to the study; 1 patient failed to complete any of the questionnaires and was left out of the analysis of the intervention. Moreover, 86% (25/29) reached satisfactory questionnaire completion (defined as completion of 60% of weekly questions over 12 weeks). The lower bound of the exact one-sided 95% CI was 71%, exceeding the 70% feasibility threshold. Most participants self-identified with having a high digital literacy level (defined as the ability to use, understand, evaluate, and analyze information from multiple formats from a variety of digital sources), and only a few participants identified with having a low digital literacy level (defined as only having the ability to gather information on the Web). Interviews were thematically analyzed to reveal the following: (1) value of emotional support and wellness in cancer treatment, (2) rise of social patient advocacy in online patient communities and networks, (3) patient concerns over privacy, and (4) desire for personalized engagement tools.  Conclusions:   Strength Through Insight was demonstrated as a feasible and acceptable method of data collection for ePROs. A high compliance rate confirmed the app as a reliable tool for patients with localized and advanced prostate cancer. Nearly all participants reported that using the smartphone app is easier than or equivalent to the traditional paper-and-pen approach, providing evidence of acceptability and support for the use of remote PRO monitoring. This study expands on current research involving the value of digital health, as a social and behavioral science, augmented with technology, can begin to contribute to population health management, as it shapes psychographic segmentation by demographic, socioeconomic, health condition, or behavioral factors to group patients by their distinct personalities and motivations, which influence their choices.

However, this goal is thwarted by the diversity and stochasticity of evolutionary trajectories that drive uncertainty in the clinic. Although biophysical models can qualitatively predict whether a mutation causes resistance, they cannot quantitatively predict the relative abundance of resistance mutations in patient populations. We present stochastic, first-principle models that are parameterized on a large in vitro dataset and that accurately predict the epidemiological abundance of resistance mutations across multiple leukemia clinical trials. The ability to forecast resistance variants requires an understanding of their underlying mutation biases. Beyond leukemia, a meta-analysis across prostate cancer, breast cancer, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors suggests that resistance evolution in the adjuvant setting is influenced by mutational bias.

We aimed to investigate whether novel imaging using prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET-CT might improve accuracy and affect management.  Methods:   In this multicentre, two-arm, randomised study, we recruited men with biopsy-proven prostate cancer and high-risk features at ten hospitals in Australia. Patients were randomly assigned to conventional imaging with CT and bone scanning or gallium-68 PSMA-11 PET-CT. First-line imaging was done within 21 days following randomisation. Patients crossed over unless three or more distant metastases were identified. The primary outcome was accuracy of first-line imaging for identifying either pelvic nodal or distant-metastatic disease defined by the receiver-operating curve using a predefined reference-standard including histopathology, imaging, and biochemistry at 6-month follow-up. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ANZCTR12617000005358.  Findings:   From March 22, 2017 to Nov 02, 2018, 339 men were assessed for eligibility and 302 men were randomly assigned. 152 (50%) men were randomly assigned to conventional imaging and 150 (50%) to PSMA PET-CT. Of 295 (98%) men with follow-up, 87 (30%) had pelvic nodal or distant metastatic disease. PSMA PET-CT had a 27% (95% CI 23-31) greater accuracy than that of conventional imaging (92% [88-95] vs 65% [60-69]; p<0·0001). We found a lower sensitivity (38% [24-52] vs 85% [74-96]) and specificity (91% [85-97] vs 98% [95-100]) for conventional imaging compared with PSMA PET-CT. Subgroup analyses also showed the superiority of PSMA PET-CT (area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve 91% vs 59% [32% absolute difference; 28-35] for patients with pelvic nodal metastases, and 95% vs 74% [22% absolute difference; 18-26] for patients with distant metastases). First-line conventional imaging conferred management change less frequently (23 [15%] men [10-22] vs 41 [28%] men [21-36]; p=0·008) and had more equivocal findings (23% [17-31] vs 7% [4-13]) than PSMA PET-CT did. Radiation exposure was 10·9 mSv (95% CI 9·8-12·0) higher for conventional imaging than for PSMA PET-CT (19·2 mSv vs 8·4 mSv; p<0·001). We found high reporter agreement for PSMA PET-CT (κ=0·87 for nodal and κ=0·88 for distant metastases). In patients who underwent second-line image, management change occurred in seven (5%) of 136 patients following conventional imaging, and in 39 (27%) of 146 following PSMA PET-CT.  Interpretation:   PSMA PET-CT is a suitable replacement for conventional imaging, providing superior accuracy, to the combined findings of CT and bone scanning.

Moreover, in vivo experiments also confirmed that the enhanced PSMA-CAR-T cells exhibited significant superior anti-tumor capabilities and could prolong the survival time in the xenograft and PDX models of prostate cancer.Conclusions: PSMA-CAR-T cells co-expressing ICR can be envisaged as a new therapeutic strategy for prostate cancer and support the translation of this enhanced approach in the clinical setting.""","""['Shao Weimin', 'Asimujiang Abula', 'Ding Qianghong', 'Wang Wenguang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Biol Ther""","""['Engineered Jurkat Cells for Targeting Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen on Prostate Cancer Cells by Nanobody-Based Chimeric Antigen Receptor.', 'Fully human antibody VH domains to generate mono and bispecific CAR to target solid tumors.', 'ShRNA-mediated silencing of PD-1 augments the efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor T cells on subcutaneous prostate and leukemia xenograft.', 'The application of prostate specific membrane antigen in CART‑cell therapy for treatment of prostate carcinoma (Review).', 'Efficacy Against Human Prostate Cancer by Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-specific, Transforming Growth Factor-β Insensitive Genetically Targeted CD8+ T-cells Derived from Patients with Metastatic Castrate-resistant Disease.', 'Harnessing the potential of CAR-T cell therapy: progress, challenges, and future directions in hematological and solid tumor treatments.', 'Up-Regulation of PSMA Expression In Vitro as Potential Application in Prostate Cancer Therapy.', 'Immunotherapy for Prostate Cancer: A Current Systematic Review and Patient Centric Perspectives.', 'CAR-T-Derived Extracellular Vesicles: A Promising Development of CAR-T Anti-Tumor Therapy.', 'Efficacy, Safety, and Challenges of CAR T-Cells in the Treatment of Solid Tumors.']"""

The different coordination modes of the acylthiourea ligands, monodentately via S (1m-6m) and bidentately via S,O (1b-6b), to ruthenium were modulated from different synthetic routes. The cytotoxicity of the complexes was evaluated in five human cell lines (DU-145, A549, MDA-MB-231, MRC-5, and MCF-10A) by MTT assay. The IC50 values for prostate cancer cells (2.89-7.47 μM) indicated that the complexes inhibited cell growth, but that they were less cytotoxic than cisplatin (2.00 μM). Unlike for breast cancer cells (IC50 = 0.28-0.74 μM) and lung cancer cells (IC50 = 0.51-1.83 μM), the complexes were notably more active than the reference drug, and a remarkable selectivity index (SI 4.66-19.34) was observed for breast cancer cells. Based on both the activity and selectivity, complexes 5b and 6b, as well as their respective analogous complexes in the monodentate coordination 5m and 6m, were chosen for further investigation in the MDA-MB-231 cell line. These complexes not only induced morphology changes but also were able to inhibit colony formation and migration.

However, duration of treatment response varies, and most patients eventually experience disease progression despite treatment. Leuprorelin is a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist, a commonly used form of ADT. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a biomarker for monitoring disease progression and predicting treatment response and survival in PCa. However, time-dependent profile of tumor regression and growth in patients with hormone-sensitive PCa on ADT has never been fully characterized. In this analysis, nationwide medical claims database provided by Humana from 2007 to 2011 was used to construct a population-based disease progression model for patients with hormone-sensitive PCa on leuprorelin. Data were analyzed by nonlinear mixed effects modeling utilizing Monte Carlo Parametric Expectation Maximization (MCPEM) method in NONMEM. Covariate selection was performed using a modified Wald's approximation method with backward elimination (WAM-BE) proposed by our group. 1113 PSA observations from 264 subjects with malignant PCa were used for model development. PSA kinetics were well described by the final covariate model. Model parameters were well estimated, but large between-patient variability was observed. Hemoglobin significantly affected proportion of drug-resistant cells in the original tumor, while baseline PSA and antiandrogen use significantly affected treatment effect on drug-sensitive PCa cells (Ds). Population estimate of Ds was 3.78 x 10-2 day-1. Population estimates of growth rates for drug-sensitive (Gs) and drug-resistant PCa cells (GR) were 1.96 x 10-3 and 6.54 x 10-4 day-1, corresponding to a PSA doubling time of 354 and 1060 days, respectively. Proportion of the original PCa cells inherently resistant to treatment was estimated to be 1.94%. Application of population-based disease progression model to clinical data allowed characterization of tumor resistant patterns and growth/regression rates that enhances our understanding of how PCa responds to ADT.""","""['Yixuan Zou', 'Fei Tang', 'Jeffery C Talbert', 'Chee M Ng']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Cardiovascular Mortality Following Short-term Androgen Deprivation in Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer: An Analysis of RTOG 94-08.', 'Two innovative pharmaceutical forms of leuprorelin: results from 818 patients with advanced prostate cancer.', 'Prospective determination of the hormonal response after cessation of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist treatment in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Initial hormonal management of androgen-sensitive metastatic, recurrent, or progressive prostate cancer: 2006 update of an American Society of Clinical Oncology practice guideline.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy with Leuprolide acetate for treatment of advanced prostate cancer.', 'Role of αVβ3 in Prostate Cancer: Metastasis Initiator and Important Therapeutic Target.']"""

However, although a family history (FH) of the same disease among close relatives is an established risk factor for prostate cancer (PC), a direct comparison of PC risk for men with each syndrome in a single population is needed.  Methods:   The Utah Population Database was used to identify 619,630 men, age ≥ 40 years, who were members of a pedigree that included at least 3 consecutive generations. Each man was evaluated for FH of hereditary PC (HPC), HBOC, and Lynch syndrome (LS) and for his own PC status. PC occurrences (N = 36,360) were classified into one or more subtypes: early onset (EO), lethal, and/or clinically significant. Relative risks (RRs) associated with each subtype, adjusted for important covariables, were calculated in STATA using a modified Poisson regression with robust error variances to obtain corresponding RR CIs for each FH definition.  Results:   An FH of HPC conveyed the greatest relative risk for all PC subtypes combined (RR, 2.30; 95% CI, 2.22 to 2.40), followed by HBOC and LS (both with 1 < RR < 2 and statistically significant). The strongest risks associated with FH were observed for EO disease in all pedigree types, consistent with the contribution of genetic factors to disease occurrence.  Conclusion:   In this large, population-based, family database, the risk of PC varied by cancer FH and was most strongly associated with EO disease. These results are critically valuable in understanding and targeting high-risk populations that would benefit from genetic screening and enhanced surveillance.""","""['Jennifer L Beebe-Dimmer', 'Ashley L Kapron', 'Alison M Fraser', 'Ken R Smith', 'Kathleen A Cooney']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['The uptake of presymptomatic genetic testing in hereditary breast-ovarian cancer and Lynch syndrome: a systematic review of the literature and implications for clinical practice.', 'Germline mutation prevalence in individuals with pancreatic cancer and a history of previous malignancy.', 'Association of Rare Pathogenic DNA Variants for Familial Hypercholesterolemia, Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome, and Lynch Syndrome With Disease Risk in Adults According to Family History.', 'Ovarian Cancer in Hereditary Cancer Susceptibility Syndromes.', 'Scoping the family history: assessment of Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer) in primary care settings--a primer for nurse practitioners.', 'Personalizing approaches to the management of metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer: role of advanced imaging, genetics and therapeutics.', 'The promising role of new molecular biomarkers in prostate cancer: from coding and non-coding genes to artificial intelligence approaches.', 'Predictors of clinically significant prostate cancer in biopsy-naïve and prior negative biopsy men with a negative prostate MRI: improving MRI-based screening with a novel risk calculator.', 'Prostate cancer incidence and survival in relation to prostate cancer as second cancer in relatives.', 'Two novel and one known pathogenic germline\xa0mutations in MMRs in Chinese families with Lynch syndrome.']"""

The purposes of this study were to assess the performance of a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) for automatic segmentation of prostates on MR images and to compare the volume estimates from the 3D CNN with those of the ellipsoid formula. MATERIALS AND METHODS. The study included 330 MR image sets that were divided into 260 training sets and 70 test sets for automated segmentation of the entire prostate. Among these, 162 training sets and 50 test sets were used for transition zone segmentation. Assisted by manual segmentation by two radiologists, the following values were obtained: estimates of ground-truth volume (VGT), software-derived volume (VSW), mean of VGT and VSW (VAV), and automatically generated volume from the 3D CNN (VNET). These values were compared with the volume calculated with the ellipsoid formula (VEL). RESULTS. The Dice similarity coefficient for the entire prostate was 87.12% and for the transition zone was 76.48%. There was no significant difference between VNET and VAV (p = 0.689) in the test sets of the entire prostate, whereas a significant difference was found between VEL and VAV (p < 0.001). No significant difference was found among the volume estimates in the test sets of the transition zone. Overall intraclass correlation coefficients between the volume estimates were excellent (0.887-0.995). In the test sets of entire prostate, the mean error between VGT and VNET (2.5) was smaller than that between VGT and VEL (3.3). CONCLUSION. The fully automated network studied provides reliable volume estimates of the entire prostate compared with those obtained with the ellipsoid formula. Fast and accurate volume measurement by use of the 3D CNN may help clinicians evaluate prostate disease.""","""['Dong Kyu Lee', 'Deuk Jae Sung', 'Chang-Su Kim', 'Yuk Heo', 'Jeong Yoon Lee', 'Beom Jin Park', 'Min Ju Kim']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""AJR Am J Roentgenol""","""['Three-dimensional Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Automated Myocardial Scar Quantification in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: A Multicenter Multivendor Study.', 'Fully automated prostate segmentation on MRI: comparison with manual segmentation methods and specimen volumes.', 'Deep Learning Network for Segmentation of the Prostate Gland With Median Lobe Enlargement in T2-weighted MR Images: Comparison With Manual Segmentation Method.', 'Review on 2D and 3D MRI Image Segmentation Techniques.', 'An artificial immune-activated neural network applied to brain 3D MRI segmentation.', 'Development and clinical utility analysis of a prostate zonal segmentation model on T2-weighted imaging: a multicenter study.', 'The Evidence for Using Artificial Intelligence to Enhance Prostate Cancer MR Imaging.', 'Automated prostate multi-regional segmentation in magnetic resonance using fully convolutional neural networks.', 'Automatic segmentation of prostate zonal anatomy on MRI: a systematic review of the literature.', 'Deep learning algorithm performs similarly to radiologists in the assessment of prostate volume on MRI.']"""

Here, we introduce EV-Ident for preparation of subpopulations of EVs in three different size fractions: large EVs (EV200 nm; 200-1 000 nm), medium EVs (EV100 nm; 100-200 nm), and small EVs (EV20 nm; 20-100 nm). Furthermore, this technology enables the in situ labeling of fluorescence markers for the protein profiling of individual EVs. As a proof-of-concept, we analyzed the presence of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) in breast cancer and prostate cancer cell-derived EVs, respectively, using three different size fractions at the single-EV level. By reducing the complexity of EV heterogeneity in each size fraction, we found that HER2-positive breast cancer cells showed the greatest expression of HER2 in EV20 nm, whereas PSMA expression was the highest in EV200 nm derived from PSMA-expressing prostate cancer cells. This increase in HER2 expression in EV20 nm and PSMA expression in EV200 nm was further confirmed in plasma-derived nanoparticles (PNPs) obtained from breast and prostate cancer patients, respectively. Our study demonstrates that single-EV analysis using EV-Ident provides a practical way to understand EV heterogeneity and to successfully identify potent subpopulation of EVs for breast and prostate cancer, which has promising translational implications for cancer theranostics. Furthermore, these findings have the potential to address fundamental questions surrounding the biology and clinical applications of EVs.""","""['Dongyoung Kim', 'Hyun-Kyung Woo', 'Chaeeun Lee', 'Yoohong Min', 'Sumit Kumar', 'Vijaya Sunkara', 'Hwi-Gyeong Jo', 'Young Joo Lee', 'Jisun Kim', 'Hong Koo Ha', 'Yoon-Kyoung Cho']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['Dual Imaging Single Vesicle Surface Protein Profiling and Early Cancer Detection.', 'Nanoscale flow cytometry to distinguish subpopulations of prostate extracellular vesicles in patient plasma.', 'A Single Extracellular Vesicle (EV) Flow Cytometry Approach to Reveal EV Heterogeneity.', 'Extracellular vesicles for liquid biopsy in prostate cancer: where are we and where are we headed?', 'Extracellular vesicles for personalized therapy decision support in advanced metastatic cancers and its potential impact for prostate cancer.', 'Biophysical Parameters of Plasma-Derived Extracellular Vesicles as Potential Biomarkers of Bone Disturbances in Breast Cancer Patients Receiving an Individualized Nutrition Intervention.', 'Extracellular Vesicles and Their Zeta Potential as Future Markers Associated with Nutrition and Molecular Biomarkers in Breast Cancer.', 'Interaction network of extracellular vesicles building universal analysis via eye tears: iNEBULA.', 'Analysis of the Significance of miR-141 and CD147 Expression in Bladder Cancer Cells and Its Relationship with Tumor Grade.', 'Single extracellular vesicle analysis for early cancer detection.']"""

The aim of this study was investigating the impact of baseline quality of life (QoL) on overall survival (OS) in mCRPC patients treated with 223Ra. The present study also evaluated the trend of patient-reported QoL during both 223Ra-treatment and post-therapy follow-up period.  Materials and methods:   One hundred and seventy-three consecutive mCRPC patients treated with 223Ra were included in this prospective study. Quality of life was assessed through EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BM22 questionnaires and 2264 questionnaires were evaluated. Other baseline variables relevant to the OS analysis have been considered. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics, univariate and multivariate analysis with Cox model. A principal component analysis (PCA) on the questionnaires' results compiled at baseline was performed to reduce the data to a one-dimensional score. Joint models for survival and longitudinal data were finally used in order to evaluate the relationship between the time-depended QoL scores and OS.  Results:   On multivariate analysis, baseline patients' hemoglobin (Hb), total alkaline phosphatase (tALP), and two EORTC QLQ-C30 items, physical functioning (HR=0.970,CI=0.960-0.980, P<0.001) and dyspnea (HR=0.992,CI=0.986-0.999, P=0.023), were significantly associated with OS. In the resulting model of the multivariate analysis performed after PCA, baseline patients' Hb, tALP and QoL-score were independent significant predictors of OS (QoL-score: HR=0.995-95%CI=0.992 - 0.998, P=0.001). The OS analysis stratified by score of baseline QoL, showed a median OS of 8 (95%CI=6-11) and 16 (95%CI=12-24) months for scores respectively below and above the cut-off value (log-rank-P<0.001). The joint model showed a significant deterioration of QoL-score during both 223Ra-therapy and follow-up period (P<0.001).

Manganese (III) meso-tetrakis (N-ethylpyridinium-2-yl) porphyrin (MnTE-2-PyP or T2E or BMX-010) and other similar manganese porphyrin compounds that scavenge superoxide molecules have been demonstrated to be effective radioprotectors and prevent the development of radiation-induced fibrosis (RIF). However, understanding the molecular pathway changes associated with these compounds remains limited for radioprotection. Recent RNA-sequencing data from our laboratory revealed that MnTE-2-PyP treatment activated the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) signaling pathway. Therefore, we hypothesize that MnTE-2-PyP protects the prostate from RIF by activating the NRF2 signaling pathway. We identified that MnTE-2-PyP is a post-translational activator of NRF2 signaling in prostate fibroblast cells, which plays a major role in fibroblast activation and myofibroblast differentiation. The mechanism of NRF2 activation involves an increase in hydrogen peroxide and a corresponding decrease in kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) levels. Activation of NRF2 signaling leads to an increase in expression of NAD(P)H dehydrogenase [quinone] 1 (NQO1), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels, sirtuin activity (nuclear and mitochondrial), and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) expression/activity. Increase in mitochondrial sirtuin activity correlates with a decrease in SOD2 (K122) acetylation. This decrease in SOD2 K122 acetylation correlates with an increase in SOD2 activity and mitochondrial superoxide scavenging capacity. Further, in human primary prostate fibroblast cells, the NRF2 pathway plays a major role in the fibroblast to myofibroblast transformation, which is responsible for the fibrotic phenotype. In the context of radiation protection, MnTE-2-PyP fails to prevent fibroblast to myofibroblast transformation in the absence of NRF2 signaling. Collectively, our results indicate that the activation of the NRF2 signaling pathway by MnTE-2-PyP is at least a partial mechanism of radioprotection in prostate fibroblast cells.""","""['Shashank Shrishrimal', 'Arpita Chatterjee', 'Elizabeth A Kosmacek', 'Paul J Davis', 'J Tyson McDonald', 'Rebecca E Oberley-Deegan']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Free Radic Biol Med""","""['MnTE-2-PyP, a manganese porphyrin, reduces cytotoxicity caused by irradiation in a diabetic environment through the induction of endogenous antioxidant defenses.', 'Superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTE-2-PyP(5+) ameliorates acute and chronic proctitis following focal proton irradiation of the rat rectum.', 'Robust rat pulmonary radioprotection by a lipophilic Mn N-alkylpyridylporphyrin, MnTnHex-2-PyP(5+).', 'Mn-porphyrins as novel molecular magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents.', 'H2O2-Driven Anticancer Activity of Mn Porphyrins and the Underlying Molecular Pathways.', 'NRF2: A crucial regulator for mitochondrial metabolic shift and prostate cancer progression.', 'NRF2 Mediates Cellular Resistance to Transformation, Radiation, and Inflammation in Mice.', 'Redox signaling at the crossroads of human health and\xa0disease.', 'MnTnHex-2-PyP5+, Coupled to Radiation, Suppresses Metastasis of 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 Breast Cancer via AKT/Snail/EMT Pathways.', 'Therapeutic and diagnostic targeting of fibrosis in metabolic, proliferative and viral disorders.']"""

Methods:   This is a retrospective study. The dataset consisted of 550 MRIs (Siemens-330, General Electric[GE]-220). A multistream 3D convolutional neural network is used for automatic segmentation of the prostate and its PZ using T2-weighted (T2-w) MRI. Prostate and PZ were manually contoured on axial T2‑w. The network uses axial, coronal, and sagittal T2‑w series as input. The preprocessing of the input data includes bias correction, resampling, and image normalization. A dataset from two MRI vendors (Siemens and GE) is used to test the proposed network. Six different models were trained, three for the prostate and three for the PZ. Of the three, two were trained on data from each vendor separately, and a third (Combined) on the aggregate of the datasets. The Dice coefficient (DSC) is used to compare the manual and predicted segmentation.  Results:   For prostate segmentation, the Combined model obtained DSCs of 0.893 ± 0.036 and 0.825 ± 0.112 (mean ± standard deviation) on Siemens and GE, respectively. For PZ, the best DSCs were from the Combined model: 0.811 ± 0.079 and 0.788 ± 0.093. While the Siemens model underperformed on the GE dataset and vice versa, the Combined model achieved robust performance on both datasets.  Conclusion:   The proposed network has a performance comparable to the interexpert variability for segmenting the prostate and its PZ. Combining images from different MRI vendors on the training of the network is of paramount importance for building a universal model for prostate and PZ segmentation.""","""['Olmo Zavala-Romero', 'Adrian L Breto', 'Isaac R Xu', 'Yu-Cherng C Chang', 'Nicole Gautney', 'Alan Dal Pra', 'Matthew C Abramowitz', 'Alan Pollack', 'Radka Stoyanova']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Strahlenther Onkol""","""['Towards a universal MRI atlas of the prostate and prostate zones : Comparison of MRI vendor and image acquisition parameters.', 'Automated segmentation of prostate zonal anatomy on T2-weighted (T2W) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map MR images using U-Nets.', 'Fully automatic segmentation on prostate MR images based on cascaded fully convolution network.', 'Segmentation of prostate zones using probabilistic atlas-based method with diffusion-weighted MR images.', 'Segmentation of the Prostate Transition Zone and Peripheral Zone on MR Images with Deep Learning.', 'Development and acceptability validation of a deep learning-based tool for whole-prostate segmentation on multiparametric MRI: a multicenter study.', 'Generative Adversarial Networks Can Create High Quality Artificial Prostate Cancer Magnetic Resonance Images.', 'A Comparative Study of Automated Deep Learning Segmentation Models for Prostate MRI.', 'Automated prostate multi-regional segmentation in magnetic resonance using fully convolutional neural networks.', 'Automatic segmentation of prostate zonal anatomy on MRI: a systematic review of the literature.']"""

Furthermore, canonical pathways evolve during disease progression and may affect treatment with existing therapies. Due to the limited treatment options after failure of hormonal and taxane therapy, and the tumor heterogeneity induced by DRD, we sought to characterize the alterations in primary and metastatic prostate cancer. Tumors from 1,027 patients with advanced prostate cancer that underwent comprehensive genomic profiling for routine clinical care were reviewed to assess DRD mutation rates (27-gene panel) and co-occurring mutations in select canonical prostate cancer pathways. DRD alterations were identified in 20 genes and in 17% of patients (BRCA2 and ATM most common) occurring with slightly higher frequency in specimens from metastatic biopsy sites and men older than 50 years of age. Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) and tumor mutational burden-high occurred with 3% frequency in the overall cohort but were not enriched in metastatic disease. Biomarkers previously associated with antitumor immunity are found at high frequencies in MSI-H patients, including JAK1 (68%) and PTEN (32%). Lastly, mutations in TP53, AR, PTEN, APC, CTNNB1, and PIK3CA were all significantly enriched in metastatic samples. We identified clinically significant subgroups of patients demonstrating (1) defects in DNA-repair pathways, (2) intrinsic prostate cancer signaling pathways that may prevent antitumor immunity, and (3) distinct genomic differences between localized and metastatic prostate cancer. These results lend support that genomic profiling for advanced prostate cancer may identify actionable targets not routinely used in the current metastatic paradigm.""","""['Nancy A Dawson', 'Matthew Zibelman', 'Timothy Lindsay', 'Rebecca A Feldman', 'Michelle Saul', 'Zoran Gatalica', 'W Michael Korn', 'Elisabeth I Heath']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Early-onset metastatic and clinically advanced prostate cancer is a distinct clinical and molecular entity characterized by increased TMPRSS2-ERG fusions.', 'Cell-free DNA profiling of metastatic prostate cancer reveals microsatellite instability, structural rearrangements and clonal hematopoiesis.', 'High prevalence of DNA damage repair gene defects and TP53 alterations in men with treatment-naïve metastatic prostate cancer -Results from a prospective pilot study using a 37 gene panel.', 'Involvement of the multiple tumor suppressor genes and 12-lipoxygenase in human prostate cancer.

In CRPC, BET proteins are key regulators of AR- and MYC-mediated transcription, while the PLK1 inhibitor potentially downregulates AR and MYC besides influencing the cell cycle. Therefore, synchronous inhibition of BET and PLK1 would be a promising approach for CRPC therapy. This study developed a dual BET and PLK1 inhibitor WNY0824 with nanomolar and equipotent inhibition of BRD4 and PLK1. In vitro, WNY0824 exhibited excellent antiproliferation activity on AR-positive CRPC cells and induced apoptosis. These activities are attributable to its disruption of the AR-transcriptional program and the inhibition of the ETS pathway. Furthermore, WNY0824 downregulated MYC and induced mitotic abnormality. In vivo, oral WNY0824 administration suppressed tumor growth in the CRPC xenograft model of enzalutamide resistance. These findings suggest that WNY0824 is a selective dual BET and PLK1 inhibitor with potent anti-CRPC oncogenic activity and provides insights into the development of other novel dual BET- and PLK1-inhibiting drugs.""","""['Ying Xu#', 'Qianqian Wang#', 'Kunjie Xiao', 'Zhihao Liu', 'Lifeng Zhao', 'Xuejiao Song', 'Xi Hu', 'Zhanzhan Feng', 'Tiantao Gao', 'Weiqiong Zuo', 'Jun Zeng', 'Ningyu Wang', 'Luoting Yu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Plk1 Inhibition Enhances the Efficacy of BET Epigenetic Reader Blockade in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Mechanistic Insights into the Selective Dual BET and PLK1 Inhibitory Activity of a Novel Benzamide Compound in Castration-Resistant Prostrate Cancer.', 'Exploitation of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Transcription Factor Dependencies by the Novel BET Inhibitor ABBV-075.', 'Role of BET proteins in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'BET bromodomain inhibitors--a novel epigenetic approach in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'When Just One Phosphate Is One Too Many: The Multifaceted Interplay between Myc and Kinases.', 'Choosing Kinase Inhibitors for Androgen Deprivation Therapy-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Dual-target inhibitors of bromodomain and extra-terminal proteins in cancer: A review from medicinal chemistry perspectives.', 'Targeting Bromodomain and Extraterminal Proteins for Drug Discovery: From Current Progress to Technological Development.', 'Clinical perspectives of BET inhibition in ovarian cancer.']"""

The molecular basis for this change has remained elusive. Using purified proteins, we report a minimal cell-free system that demonstrates interdomain cooperativity between the ligand (LBD) and DNA binding domains (DBD) of AR, and its autoinhibition by the N terminus of AR. Furthermore, we identify ERG as a cofactor that activates AR's ability to bind DNA in both high and lower affinity contexts through direct interaction within a newly identified AR-interacting motif (AIM) in the ETS domain, independent of ERG's own DNA binding ability. Finally, we present evidence that this interaction is conserved among ETS factors whose expression is altered in prostate cancer.

Disease volume was classified as high volume (≥4 bone metastases or visceral metastases) versus low volume.  Results:   Among 424 patients (88% white), 213 (50%) had high-volume disease and 211 (50%) had low-volume disease, 275 (65%) had de novo metastatic disease, and 149 (35%) had metastatic recurrence of nonmetastatic disease.

Tumors from high-volume disease had more copy number alterations. The NOTCH, cell cycle, and epigenetic modifier pathways were the highest-ranking pathways enriched in high-volume disease. De novo metastatic disease differed from metastatic recurrences in the prevalence of CDK12 alterations but had similar prognosis. Rates of castration resistance differed 1.5-fold to 5-fold according to alterations in AR, SPOP (inverse), and TP53, and the cell cycle, WNT (inverse), and MYC pathways, adjusting for disease volume and other genomic pathways. Overall survival rates differed 2-fold to 4-fold according to AR, SPOP (inverse), WNT (inverse), and cell-cycle alterations.

These two extreme patterns have not been compared at prostatectomy. We hypothesized that at prostatectomy the expansile cribriform pattern would be associated with histopathologic and molecular features of aggressiveness and with greater risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) than the glomerulation pattern.  Methods:   In a retrospective cohort study, radical prostatectomy reports with expansile cribriform pattern or glomerulation pattern were analyzed for percentage of total pattern 4, extraprostatic extension (EPE), positive lymph nodes, seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), and intraductal carcinoma (IDC).

The electronic medical record was reviewed for BCR-free survival and for Decipher test results.  Results:   Of 1020 radical prostatectomies from July 2015 to July 2018, 110 (11%) had either expansile cribriform or glomerulation pattern present. The expansile cribriform group was associated with more histopathologic features of aggressiveness, with higher average total percentage pattern 4 (43.7 vs 27.0, P = .002), a trend of greater extensive EPE (32.7% vs 17.2%, P = .06), a trend toward statistical significance of higher rate of SVI (11.5% vs 3.4%, P = .1), greater positive lymph nodes (9.6% vs 0%, P = .02), and a higher percentage of cases with or suspicious for IDC (23.1% vs 8.6%, P = .04). The risk of BCR was 4.4 (1.3-15.4) fold greater for the expansile cribriform group vs the glomerulations group (P = .02). For the 38 patients who underwent Decipher testing, the expansile cribriform group had a high-risk assay category mean score whereas the glomerulations group had an average risk assay category mean score (0.61 vs 0.47, P = .02).

Purpose:   To evaluate the accuracy of three mpMRI series (T2 WI, diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI], and dynamic contrast-enhanced image [DCEI]) and VI-RADS for diagnosing the muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).  Study type:   Retrospective.  Population:   In all, 66 pathologically proven bladder cancers in 32 patients.  Field strength/sequence:   Before the diagnostic MRI with an intramuscular antispasmodic agent, optimal bladder distension was confirmed. 3.0T MRI with T2 WI, DWI, and DCEI.  Assessment:   Three reviewers independently assessed and scored the bladder cancers in T2 WI, DWI, and DCEI using a five-point score system. Based on the scores in the three sequences, reviewers scored each bladder cancer with reference to VI-RADS categories. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of each of three mpMRI sequences and the final VI-RADS categorization for diagnosing MIBC.  Statistical tests:   Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and the area under the curve (AUC) of each of three sequences separately and VI-RADS categorization for diagnosing the MIBC.  Results:   The diagnostic performances of each of the three mpMRI series and VI-RADS for diagnosing MIBC were excellent. Especially using the optimal cutoff score >3 for predicting MIBC on DWI, DCEI, and VI-RADS, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and AUC values were 90% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.56, 1.00), 100% (95% CI: 0.94, 1.00), 100% (95% CI: 0.66. 1.00), 98.3% (95% CI: 0.91, 1.00), and 0.95, respectively.

The contribution of seven polymorphisms in BRCA1/2 and VDR genes to PC susceptibility was evaluated in 370 incident PC cases and 759 age-matched (±5 years) controls belonging to the Mexican population. Based on Gleason score at diagnosis, PC cases were classified as well-differentiated PC (Gleason <7) and moderate or poorly differentiated PC (Gleason ≥7).

Current studies on metastasis-directed therapy in patients with node-only recurrence suggest a positive influence on the prognosis in selected patients. Nevertheless, most studies are retrospective and, due to a lack of high-level evidence, salvage lymph node dissection (SLND) is not recommended by current guidelines.The aim of this work is to provide a critical summary of the current data on SLND in patients with nodal recurrent prostate cancer with a focus on imaging procedures, extent of SLND and oncological outcome.European guidelines recommend the use of choline or PSMA PET/CT imaging if prostate cancer recurrence is suspected. PSMA PET/CT is superior to choline PET/CT in sensitivity and specificity and should be the preferred approach. Nevertheless, if SLND is performed, common practice is bilateral SLND - even if only unilateral lymph node involvement is detected by PSMA PET/CT. However, unilateral SLND can also be considered. A randomised prospective trial (ProSTone) is being initiated for clarification.PSMA radioguided surgery seems to be a new promising surgical approach. It facilitates the intraoperative detection of lymph node metastases. However, long-term data are still awaited.All in all, SLND achieves a respectable biochemical response rate in carefully selected patients.

Here, we report the novel mechanisms by which 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) targets AR to stimulate cell death in both hormone-responsive and -refractory prostate cancer cells. We found that miR-488, a tumor suppressive microRNA, was markedly induced by GA treatment, resulting in the down-regulation of AR expression and inhibition of cellular responses mediated by androgens. Moreover, GA not only suppressed the expression of androgen target genes (TMPRSS2, PSA, and NKX3.1), but also enhanced the suppressive effect of anti-androgens (bicalutamide and flutamide) on LNCaP cell growth. Our data further provides evidence that down-regulation of AR expression by GA may occur through transcriptional suppression at AR promoter region between - 1014 and - 829. Ectopic expression of SFR and E2F3α reversed the inhibitory effect of GA on AR promoter activity as well as protein expression, suggesting that GA may target transcription factors SRF and E2F3α to regulate AR expression.

Recent study results have shown that NFI family may play a critical role in the progression of various human tumors and have been identified as key tumor suppressors and oncogenes for many cancers. However, the expression levels and distinctive prognostic values of the NFI family remain poorly explored in most cancers.  Materials and methods:   In the present study, the differences in mRNA expression of the NFI family in various cancers were investigated using the Oncomine and TCGA databases, and the mRNA expression, genetic alteration and DNA methylation of the NFI family members in various cancers were examined using cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics. In addition, the prognostic significance of the NFI family was assessed in multiple cancers using the Kaplan-Meier plotter (KM plotter) and SurvExpress databases.  Results:   The mRNA expression levels in the NFI family were significantly downregulated in most cancers compared with normal tissues and DNA hypermethylation might downregulate the NFI family expression. Although NFIX expression was not downregulated in kidney, colorectal and prostate cancers. Furthermore, NFIB expression was upregulated in gastric cancer. Further survival analyses based on the KM plotter and SurvExpress databases showed dysregulations of the NFI genes were significantly correlated with survival outcomes in breast, lung, and head and neck cancers. Decreased expression levels of NFIA, NFIB and NFIC were associated with poor overall survival (OS) in head and neck cancer.

The incidence and mortality associated with PCa has been rapidly increasing in China recently.  Methods:   Multiple diagnostic models of human PCa were developed based on Taylor database by combining the artificial neural networks (ANNs) to enhance the ability of PCa diagnosis. Genetic algorithm (GA) is used to select feature genes as numerical encoded parameters that reflect cancer, metastatic, or normal samples. Back propagation (BP) neural network and learning vector quantization (LVQ) neural network were used to build different Cancer/Normal, Primary/Metastatic, and Gleason Grade diagnostic models.  Results:   The performance of these modeling approaches was evaluated by predictive accuracy (ACC) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). By observing the statistically significant parameters of the three training sets, our Cancer/Normal, Primary/Metastatic, and Gleason Grade models' with ACC and AUC can be drawn (97.33%, 0.9832), (99.17%, 0.9952), and (90.48%, 0.8742), respectively.  Conclusion:   These results indicated that our diagnostic models of human PCa based on Taylor database combining the feature gene expression profiling data and artificial intelligence algorithms might act as a powerful tool for diagnosing PCa.

Visualization of high-level feature levels through t -distributed stochastic neighbor embedding reveals substantial overlap between data from two different scanners. Qualitatively, we examined the use of the sSWE methodology for B-mode images obtained with a scanner without SWE functionality. We also examined the use of this type of network in elasticity imaging in the thyroid. Limitations of the technique reside in the fact that networks have to be retrained for different organs, and that the method requires standardization of the imaging settings and procedure.

Previously, we reported that GRT, a standardized, pharmaceutical-grade aspalathin-rich extract (12.78 g aspalathin/100 g extract), prepared from green rooibos produced from the leaves and fine stems of Aspalathus linearis, inhibits the proliferation of PCa cells, meriting this investigation to determine if GRT can suppress the migration and invasion of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells.  Purpose:   In the present study, we investigated whether GRT extract can interfere with the migration and invasion of human CRPC cells.  Methods:   Transwell assays were used to explore the effects of GRT on the migration and invasion of CRPC cells. Micro-Western Array (MWA) and Western blot analysis were carried out to unravel the underlying molecular mechanism(s).  Results:   Treatment with 25-100 μg/ml GRT suppressed the migration and invasion of LNCaP C4-2B and 22Rv1 CRPC cells. MWA and Western blot analysis indicated that GRT treatment suppressed the protein level of yes-associated protein (YAP), macrophage stimulating 1 protein (MST1), phospho-MST1/phospho-MST2 T183/T180, and paxillin, but increased the abundance of E-cadherin. Over-expression of YAP rescued the suppressive effects of GRT on migration and invasion of CRPC cells. Treatment with the major flavonoid of GRT - the C-glucosyl dihydrochalcone, aspalathin - at a concentration of 75-100 μg/ml also reduced the migration and invasion of CRPC cells, and the inhibition was partially rescued by YAP over-expression.

However, access to high-volume hospitals is unequal. We investigated racial and socioeconomic disparities among patients undergoing surgery for genitourinary malignancies at high-volume hospitals.  Material and methods:   We queried the National Cancer Database from 2004-2015 to identify patients who underwent radical prostatectomy, radical cystectomy, and nephrectomy for nonmetastatic prostate cancer, muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer, and kidney cancer, respectively. Hospitals were ranked based on their annual volume for the given procedure. The endpoint of our study was receipt of treatment at a high-volume hospital. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of treatment at a high-volume hospital.  Results:   Our final cohort consisted of 397,242 prostate cancer patients, 39,480 bladder cancer patients, and 292,095 kidney cancer patients. For prostate and bladder cancer, Black race was associated with lower odds of treatment at a high-volume hospital (Odds Ratio [OR] 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79-0.87 and 0.71, 95%CI 0.58-0.87; reference: White). Higher education level and private insurance status were associated with greater odds of treatment across all 3 procedures (strongest effect for prostate cancer; higher education level: OR 1.63 [1.58-1.68]; private insurance 1.86 [1.77-1.97]). Moreover, an interaction was found between race and study period for all cancers examined (P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed that Black patients were more likely to undergo radical prostatectomy at high-volume hospitals in 2013-2015 (OR 0.98, 95%CI 0.94-1.02) compared to 2004-2006 (OR 0.83, 95%CI 0.79-0.87).  Conclusion:   Across all procedures, patients with lower education status and lack of insurance were less likely to be treated at high-volume hospitals.

We investigated the effect of higher radiation doses on freedom from biochemical failure (FBF) and prostate cancer mortality (cause-specific survival [CSS]) in men treated with a combination of permanent implant and external beam irradiation (EBRT).  Methods and materials:   Three hundred twenty men with GG4 (n = 186) and 5 (n = 134) prostate cancer were treated with I-125 or Pd-103 implant followed by 45 Gy of EBRT. Radiation doses were converted to the biological equivalent dose (BED). The median age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), time on hormone therapy, BED, and followup were 69 years, 9.0 ng/mL, 9 months, 210 Gy, and 6.5 years, respectively. FBF and CSS were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method with associations determined by log rank and Cox regression.  Results:   Ten-year FBF for GG4 vs. 5 was 77.8 vs. 61.3% (p = 0.015), and CSS was 94 vs. 79.3% (p = 0.001). Men with lower PSA had improved FBF and CSS (p < 0.001). Thirty-one of 320 died of prostate cancer of which 10/186 (5.4%) had GG4 and 21/134 (15.7%) GG5 (OR 3.3, p = 0.002).

Methods:   Using RT-PCR, we detected the expression of RP1-90L14.1 in LNCaP and LNCaP-AI cells, transiently transfected the RP1-90L14.1 overexpression plasmid (the RP1-90L14.1 group) and vector plasmid (the LNCaP-NC group) into the LNCaP cells, and cultured the two groups of cells with ordinary medium and phenol red-free activated carbon adsorption medium (PRF-ACA). Then we examined the proliferation, migration and invasiveness of the cells by CCK-8 and Transwell, and determined the mRNA and protein expressions of GRIN2A and BACE2 by RT-PCR and Western blot.  Results:   The expression of RP1-90L14.1 was significantly higher in the LNCaP-AI than in the LNCaP cells (8.49 ± 0.43 vs 2.53 ± 0.95, P < 0.05), and so was that of LNCaP-RP1-90L14.1 in the RP1-90L14.1 than in the LNCaP-NC group after transfection (0.71 ± 0.22 vs 0.02 ± 0.01, P < 0.05). The optical densities (OD) of the cells were 51.95% and 50.69% higher in the RP1-90L14.1 than in the LNCaP-NC group after 72 hours of culture with ordinary medium and phenol red-free ACA (1.22 ± 0.08 vs 0.08 ± 0.05, P < 0.05; 0.79 ± 0.02 vs 0.53 ± 0.05, P < 0.05), and 51.72% and 60.23% higher in the former than in the latter after 96 hours (1.72 ± 0.07 vs 1.13 ± 0.05, P < 0.05; 1.18 ± 0.05 vs 0.73 ± 0.08, P < 0.05). The numbers of the migrating cells cultured with common medium and PRF-ACA were markedly higher in the RP1-90L14.1 than in the LNCaP-NC group after transfection (682.0 ± 42.7 vs 422.0 ± 37.1, P < 0.05; 419.0 ± 42.9 vs 251.0 ± 25.9, P < 0.05), and so were those of the invading cells (507.0 ± 22.2 vs 274.0 ± 19.6, P < 0.05; 352.0 ± 14.1 vs 216.0 ± 14.3, P < 0.05).

Yet, despite their vulnerabilities, we know little about how cancer survivors use opioids for non-cancer perioperative pain compared to those with no history of cancer. The purpose was to examine the association of cancer survivorship with the likelihood of receiving perioperative opioid therapy for non-cancer minor surgery.  Methods:   Using 2007-2014 SEER-Medicare data for breast, colorectal, prostate, and non-cancer populations, we conducted retrospective cohort study of opioid-naïve Medicare beneficiaries who underwent one of six common minor non-cancer surgeries. Modified Poisson regression estimated the relative risk of receiving a perioperative opioid prescription associated with cancer survivorship compared to no history of cancer. Stabilized inverse probability of treatment weights were used to balance measurable covariates between cohorts.  Results:   We included 1486 opioid-naïve older adult cancer survivors and 3682 opioid-naïve non-cancer controls. Cancer survivorship was associated with a 5% lower risk of receiving a perioperative opioid prescription (95% confidence interval: 0.89, 1.00; p = 0.06) compared to no history of cancer. Cancer survivorship was not associated with the extent of perioperative opioid exposure.  Conclusion:   Cancer survivors were slightly less likely to receive opioid therapy for non-cancer perioperative pain than those without a history of cancer. It is unclear if this reflects a reduced risk of opioid-related harms for cancer survivors or avoidance of appropriate perioperative pain therapy.

However, hormone therapy has associated morbidity, and there are no validated predictive biomarkers to identify which patients derive most benefit from treatment.  Objective:   To examine the role of pre-SRT prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels to personalize hormone therapy use with SRT.  Interventions:   Men were randomized to SRT plus high-dose nonsteroidal antiandrogen (bicalutamide, 150 mg/d) or placebo for 2 years.  Design, setting, and participants:   In this secondary analysis of the multicenter RTOG 9601 double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial conducted from 1998 to 2003 by a multinational cooperative group, men with a positive surgical margin or pathologic T3 disease after radical prostatectomy with pre-SRT PSA of 0.2 to 4.0 ng/mL were included. Analysis was performed between March 4, 2019, and December 20, 2019.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points included distant metastasis (DM), other-cause mortality (OCM), and grades 3 to 5 cardiac and neurologic toxic effects. Subgroup analyses were performed using the protocol-specified PSA stratification variable (1.5 ng/mL) and additional PSA cut points, including test for interaction. Competing risk analyses were performed for DM and other-cause mortality (OCM).  Results:   Overall, 760 men with PSA elevation after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer were included. The median (range) age of particpants was 65 (40-83) years. Antiandrogen assignment was associated with an OS benefit in the PSA stratum greater than 1.5 ng/mL (n = 118) with a 25% 12-year absolute benefit (hazard ratio [HR], 0.45; 95% CI, 0.25-0.81), but not in the PSA of 1.5 ng/mL or less stratum (n = 642) (1% 12-year absolute difference; HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.66-1.16). In a subanalysis of men with PSA of 0.61 to 1.5 (n = 253), there was an OS benefit associated with antiandrogen assignment (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.39-0.94). In those receiving early SRT (PSA ≤0.6 ng/mL, n = 389), there was no improvement in OS (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.79-1.70), an increased OCM hazard (subdistribution HR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.17-3.20; P = .01), and an increased odds of late grades 3 to 5 cardiac and neurologic toxic effects (odds ratio, 3.57; 95% CI, 1.09-15.97; P = .05).  Conclusions and relevance:   These results suggest that pre-SRT PSA level may be a prognostic biomarker for outcomes of antiandrogen treatment with SRT. In patients receiving late SRT (PSA >0.6 ng/mL, hormone therapy was associated with improved outcomes. In men receiving early SRT (PSA ≤0.6 ng/mL), long-term antiandrogen treatment was not associated with improved OS.

Design, setting, and participants:   The Observation vs Stereotactic Ablative Radiation for Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer (ORIOLE) phase 2 randomized study accrued participants from 3 US radiation treatment facilities affiliated with a university hospital from May 2016 to March 2018 with a data cutoff date of May 20, 2019, for analysis. Of 80 men screened, 54 men with recurrent hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and 1 to 3 metastases detectable by conventional imaging who had not received ADT within 6 months of enrollment or 3 or more years total were randomized.  Interventions:   Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive SABR or observation.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcome was progression at 6 months by prostate-specific antigen level increase, progression detected by conventional imaging, symptomatic progression, ADT initiation for any reason, or death. Predefined secondary outcomes were toxic effects of SABR, local control at 6 months with SABR, progression-free survival, Brief Pain Inventory (Short Form)-measured quality of life, and concordance between conventional imaging and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted positron emission tomography in the identification of metastatic disease.  Results:   In the 54 men randomized, the median (range) age was 68 (61-70) years for patients allocated to SABR and 68 (64-76) years for those allocated to observation. Progression at 6 months occurred in 7 of 36 patients (19%) receiving SABR and 11 of 18 patients (61%) undergoing observation (P = .005). Treatment with SABR improved median progression-free survival (not reached vs 5.8 months; hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.11-0.81; P = .002). Total consolidation of PSMA radiotracer-avid disease decreased the risk of new lesions at 6 months (16% vs 63%; P = .006). No toxic effects of grade 3 or greater were observed. T-cell receptor sequencing identified significant increased clonotypic expansion following SABR and correlation between baseline clonality and progression with SABR only (0.082085 vs 0.026051; P = .03).  Conclusions and relevance:   Treatment with SABR for oligometastatic prostate cancer improved outcomes and was enhanced by total consolidation of disease identified by PSMA-targeted positron emission tomography. SABR induced a systemic immune response, and baseline immune phenotype and tumor mutation status may predict the benefit from SABR.

However, little is known about genetic variants in the EMT pathway as predictors of aggressiveness, biochemical recurrence (BCR) and disease reclassification in localized PCa.  Patients and methods:   In this multistage study, we evaluated 5186 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 264 genes related to EMT pathway to identify SNPs associated with PCa aggressiveness and BCR in the MD Anderson PCa (MDA-PCa) patient cohort (N = 1762), followed by assessment of the identified SNPs with disease reclassification in the active surveillance (AS) cohort (N = 392).  Results:   In the MDA-PCa cohort, 312 SNPs were associated with high D'Amico risk (P < 0.05), among which, 14 SNPs in 10 genes were linked to BCR risk. In the AS cohort, 2 of 14 identified SNPs (rs76779889 and rs7083961) in C-terminal Binding Proteins 2 gene were associated with reclassification risk. The associations of rs76779889 with different endpoints were: D'Amico high versus low, odds ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)] = 2.89 (1.32-6.34), P = 0.008; BCR, hazard ratio (HR) (95% CI) = 2.88 (1.42-5.85), P = 0.003; and reclassification, HR (95% CI) = 2.83 (1.40-5.74), P = 0.004.

However, the effects and the relevant molecular mechanisms of TRPM7 on metastasis of prostate cancer under hypoxic atmosphere remain unclear. This study investigated the role of TRPM7 in the metastatic ability of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells under hypoxia. First, data mining was carried out to disclose the relationship between the TRPM7 gene level and the survival of prostate cancer patients. Specific siRNAs were used to knockdown target genes. Western blotting and qPCR were employed to determine protein and gene expression, respectively. The gene transcription activity was evaluated by luciferase activity assay of promoter gene. The protein interaction was determined by coimmunoprecipitation. Wound healing and transwell assays were employed to evaluated cell migration and invasion, respectively. Open access database results showed that high expression of TRPM7 was closely related to the poor survival of prostate cancer patients. Hypoxia simultaneously increased TRPM7 expression and induced HIF-1α accumulation in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. Knockdown of TRPM7 significantly promoted HIF-1α degradation through the proteasome and inhibited EMT changes in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells under hypoxic condition. Moreover, TRPM7 knockdown increased the phosphorylation of RACK1 and strengthened the interaction between RACK1 and HIF-1α but attenuated the binding of HSP90 to HIF-1α. Whereas knockdown of RACK1 increased the binding of HSP90 to HIF-1α. Furthermore, both TRPM7 and HIF-1α knockdown significantly suppressed hypoxia-induced Annexin A1 protein expression, and suppression of HIF-1α/Annexin A1 signaling significantly inhibited hypoxia-induced cell migration and invasion of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. Our findings demonstrate that TRPM7 knockdown promotes HIF-1α degradation via an oxygen-independent mechanism involving increased binding of RAKC1 to HIF-1α, and TRPM7-HIF-1α-Annexin A1 signaling axis plays a crucial role in the EMT, cell migration, and invasion of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells under hypoxic conditions.""","""['Fei Yang', 'Jiarong Cai', 'Hailun Zhan', 'Jie Situ', 'Wenbiao Li', 'Yunhua Mao', 'Yun Luo']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Oxid Med Cell Longev""","""['Ion channel TRPM8 promotes hypoxic growth of prostate cancer cells via an O2 -independent and RACK1-mediated mechanism of HIF-1α stabilization.', 'The role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and -2α in androgen insensitive prostate cancer cells.', 'A ROS/STAT3/HIF-1α signaling cascade mediates EGF-induced TWIST1 expression and prostate cancer cell invasion.', 'RACK1 vs. HSP90: competition for HIF-1 alpha degradation vs. stabilization.', 'The role of hypoxia on prostate cancer progression and metastasis.', 'STEAP1 Knockdown Decreases the Sensitivity of Prostate Cancer Cells to Paclitaxel, Docetaxel and Cabazitaxel.', 'LncRNA DGUOK-AS1 facilitates non-small cell lung cancer growth and metastasis through increasing TRPM7 stability via m6A modification.', 'Calcium signalling pathways in prostate cancer initiation and progression.', 'On the modulation of TRPM channels: Current perspectives and anticancer therapeutic implications.', 'Andrographolide suppresses hypoxia-induced embryonic hyaloid vascular system development through HIF-1a/VEGFR2 signaling pathway.']"""

PVI is the ratio between the central transition zone volume (CTZV) and the peripheral zone volume (PZV).  Materials and methods:   Parameters evaluated included age, prostate specific antigen (PSA), total prostate volume (TPV), PSA density (PSAD), digital rectal exam (DRE), PVI, PCI and number of positive cores (NPC). All patients underwent baseline 14-core, trans-perineal random biopsies. Associations of parameters with the NPC were investigated by univariate and multivariate linear regression analysis.  Results:   Between September 2010 to September 2017, 945 patients were evaluated. PCA was detected in 477 cases (50.7%), PCI in 205 cases (21.7%). PCA patients, compared to negative cases, were older (68.3 vs. 64.4 years) with smaller TPV (36 vs. 48.3mL) and CTZV (19.2 vs. 25.4), higher PSAD (0.24 vs. 0.15ng/mL/mL), further PVI values were lower (0.9 vs. 1.18) and biopsy cores less frequently involved by PCI (9.4% vs. 34.2%). High PVI and the presence of PCI were independent negative predictors of NPC in model I considering PSA and TVP (PVI, regression coefficient, RC -0,6; p=0.002) and PCI (RC -1,4; p<0.0001); and in model II considering PSAD (PVI:RC -0,7; p<0,0001; and PCI: RC -1,5; p<0.0001).  Conclusions:   High PVI and the presence of PCI lowered the mean rate of NPC and is associated with less aggressive tumor biology expressed by low tumor burden. PVI can give prognostic information before planning baseline random biopsies. Confirmatory studies are required.""","""['Antonio B Porcaro', 'Alessandro Tafuri', 'Marco Sebben', 'Giovanni Novella', 'Tania Processali', 'Marco Pirozzi', 'Nelia Amigoni', 'Riccardo Rizzetto', 'Aliasger Shakir', 'Matteo Brunelli', 'Maria Angela Cerruto', 'Filippo Migliorini', 'Salvatore Siracusano', 'Walter Artibani']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int Braz J Urol""","""['Prostate Volume Index Is Able to Differentiate between Prostatic Chronic Inflammation and Prostate Cancer in Patients with Normal Digital Rectal Examination and Prostate-Specific Antigen Values <10 ng/mL: Results of 564 Biopsy Naïve Cases.', 'Prostate volume index and prostatic chronic inflammation have an effect on tumor load at baseline random biopsies in patients with normal DRE and PSA values less than 10\u2009ng/ml: results of 564 consecutive cases.', 'Prostate volume index and prostatic chronic inflammation predicted low tumor load in 945 patients at baseline prostate biopsy.', 'Prostatic chronic inflammation and prostate cancer risk at baseline random biopsy: Analysis of predictors.', 'Evaluation of prostate specific antigen density and transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsies in 100 consecutive patients with a negative digital rectal examination and intermediate serum prostate specific antigen levels.', 'In these difficult times of COVID-19, urologic research cannot stop: COVID-19 pandemic and reconstructive urology highlighted in International Brazilian Journal of Urology.']"""

The aim of this study was to compare the pain levels in TRUS-guided standard 12-core prostate biopsy (SPB) and MpMRI-guided FPB.  Materials and methods:   Patients detected with a PI-RADS (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System) ≥3 lesion on MpMRI underwent MpMRI-guided FPB (Group I) and the patients who had no suspected lesions or had a PI-RADS<3 lesion on MpMRI underwent TRUS-guided SPB (Group II). Pain assessment was performed using Visual Analog Scale (VAS) five minutes after the procedure. Following the procedure, the patients were asked to indicate the most painful biopsy step among the three steps.  Results:   252 patients were included in this study (Group I=159, Group II=93). The mean number of cores and the malignancy detection rate were significantly higher in Group I compared to Group II (p<0.001, p=0.043, respectively). No significant difference was found between the two groups with regard to VAS scores (p=0.070). The most painful part of the whole procedure was revealed to be the insertion of the probe into the rectum. However, no significant difference was found between the two groups with regard to the most painful biopsy step (p=0.140).  Conclusion:   FPB, with a relatively higher cancer detection rate, leads to the same pain level as SPB although it increases the number of biopsy cores and involves a more complex procedure compared to SPB. Further prospective studies with larger patient series are needed to substantiate our findings.""","""['Abdullah Demirtaş', 'Gökhan Sönmez', 'Şevket Tolga Tombul', 'Türev Demirtaş']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int Braz J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment: Comparison of pain levels in fusion prostate biopsy and standard TRUS-Guided biopsy.', 'Association Between Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) Score for the Index Lesion and Multifocal, Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeted MRI/TRUS fusion-guided biopsy in men with previous prostate biopsies using a novel registration software and multiparametric MRI PI-RADS scores: first results.', 'Prostate cancer detection on transrectal ultrasonography-guided random biopsy despite negative real-time magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasonography fusion-guided targeted biopsy: reasons for targeted biopsy failure.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging in prostate cancer detection and management: a systematic review.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Up-to-Date Imaging and Diagnostic Techniques for Prostate Cancer: A Literature Review.', ""Prospective analysis of pain expectancy and experience during MR-fusion prostate biopsy: does reality match patients' expectancy?"", 'The role of music in outpatient prostate biopsy: A comprehensive literature review.', 'Pain control according to the periprostatic nerve block site in magnetic resonance imaging/transrectal targeted prostate biopsy.', 'Recent Advances in Systematic and Targeted Prostate Biopsies.']"""

Objectives:   The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of baseline clinical variables associated with overall survival (OS) and toxicity of 223Ra. Its purpose was to identify the factors that can predict a better response to treatment and provide information regarding the most appropriate time for the application of 223Ra.  Materials and methods:   Prospective study in 40p with mCRPC treated with 223Ra. End points were OS, progression-free survival and time to progression. The follow-up parameters were: doses received, hemoglobin (Hb), absolute neutrophil count (ANC), platelet count (PC), prostate specific antigen (PSA), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Visual Analogue Scale for pain, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) and WHO's Cancer Pain Ladder. The use of other treatments was also evaluated.  Results:   Median OS was 17.1 months(mo) (CI95%6.5-27.7); 26/40p received complete treatment of 223Ra, without reaching a median OS and 14p received incomplete treatment with a median OS 13.6mo(CI95%1.6-25.6). Median follow-up was 11.2mo (range:1.3-45.2). The univariate analysis showed that factors as VAS, ECOG, Hb and ALP values were independently associated with OS. First line treatment with 223Ra was started in 11/40p, while 19p had been heavily pre-treated and 13p received concomitant treatment.  Conclusions:   223Ra therapy require an adequate selection of patients to obtain the greatest clinical benefit. Low basal Hb, hight basal ALP, bone marrow involvement and an altered ECOG were the main factors that decreased OS in our patients. 223Ra should be considered relatively early in the course of treatment.

This study investigated the expression of miRNA-182 and miRNA-187 in prostate cancer patients and established a correlation between miRNA expression and staging of prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   This prospective observational study involved patients undergoing transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy for suspicion of prostate cancer. Pre-biopsy urine samples and prostatic core tissue samples of the patients were preserved and the miRNA-182 and miRNA-187 were studied.  Results:   Sixty-three patients were included in this study, thirty-three patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer and thirty patients having benign histopathology were considered as controls. The expression of miRNA-182 was significantly increased (p=0.002) and miRNA-187 significantly decreased (p<0.001) in prostate cancer tissue specimens. However, the expression of these miRNAs did not significantly differ in the urine of prostate cancer patients as compared to controls. Serum Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA) inversely correlated with the median expression of miR-187 in prostatic tissue (p=0.002). Further, the expression of miRNA-187 in prostate cancer tissue was significantly decreased in metastatic prostate cancer (p=0.037). Using ROC analysis, miRNA-187 expression was able to distinguish the presence or absence of bone metastasis [area under ROC (AUROC) (±SD) was 0.873±0.061, p<0.001].  Conclusion:   The miRNA-182 and miRNA-187 appear to be promising biomarkers in prostate cancer and miRNA-187 can serve as an important diagnostic marker of metastatic prostate cancer.""","""['Brusabhanu Nayak', 'Naveed Khan', 'Harshit Garg', 'Yashika Rustagi', 'Prabhjot Singh', 'Amlesh Seth', 'Amit Kumar Dinda', 'Seema Kaushal']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int Braz J Urol""","""['microRNA expression in tumour tissue and plasma in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Investigating differential miRNA expression profiling using serum and urine specimens for detecting potential biomarkers for early prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Urinary miR-183 and miR-205 do not surpass PCA3 in urine as predictive markers for prostate biopsy outcome despite their highly dysregulated expression in prostate cancer tissue.', 'Role of miRNA-145, 148, and 185 and Stem Cells in Prostate Cancer.', 'MicroRNA in prostate cancer: Practical aspects.', 'Lipid metabolism-related miRNAs with potential diagnostic roles in prostate cancer.', 'Modulation of Small RNA Signatures by Astrocytes on Early Neurodegeneration Stages; Implications for Biomarker Discovery.', 'The Potential of MicroRNAs as Non-Invasive Prostate Cancer Biomarkers: A Systematic Literature Review Based on a Machine Learning Approach.', 'MiR-574-5p promotes cell proliferation by negatively regulating small C-terminal domain phosphatase 1 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'The Mechanistic Roles of Sirtuins in Breast and Prostate Cancer.']"""
