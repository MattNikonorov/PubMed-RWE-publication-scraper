In the present research, we adopted a comprehensive bioinformatics method to identify some biomarkers associated with the tumor progression and prognosis of PCa.  Methods:   Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were applied for exploring gene modules correlative with tumor progression and prognosis of PCa. Clinically Significant Modules were distinguished, and Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis were used to Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were used in selecting potential hub genes. RNA-Seq data and clinical materials of prostate cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were used for the identification and validation of hub genes. The significance of these genes was confirmed via survival analysis and immunohistochemistry.  Results:   2688 DEGs were filtered. Weighted gene co-expression network was constructed, and DEGs were divided into 6 modules. Two modules were selected as hub modules which were highly associated with the tumor grades. Functional enrichment analysis was performed on genes in hub modules. Thirteen hub genes in these hub modules were identified through PPT networks. Based on TCGA data, 4 of them (CCNB1, TTK, CNN1, and ACTG2) were correlated with prognosis. The protein levels of CCNB1, TTK, and ACTG2 had a degree of differences between tumor tissues and normal tissues.  Conclusion:   Four hub genes were identified as candidate biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for further studies of exploring molecular mechanisms and individual therapy on PCa.""","""['Xuan Chen', 'Jingyao Wang', 'Xiqi Peng', 'Kaihao Liu', 'Chunduo Zhang', 'Xingzhen Zeng', 'Yongqing Lai']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Identification of key genes and pathways in castrate-resistant prostate cancer by integrated bioinformatics analysis.', 'Investigation of Potential Mechanisms Associated with Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Identification of hub genes associated with prognosis, diagnosis, immune infiltration and therapeutic drug in liver cancer by integrated analysis.', 'Bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation of TTK as a biomarker for prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'In silico identification of key genes and signaling pathways targeted by a panel of signature microRNAs in prostate cancer.', 'ARPC1A correlates with poor prognosis in prostate cancer and is up-regulated by glutamine metabolism to promote tumor cell migration, invasion and cytoskeletal changes.', 'MiR-423-5p prevents MALAT1-mediated proliferation and metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'Limitations of Explainability for Established Prognostic Biomarkers of Prostate Cancer.', 'Exploration and validation of related hub gene expression during SARS-CoV-2 infection of human bronchial organoids.', 'ROCK1 knockdown inhibits non-small-cell lung cancer progression by activating the LATS2-JNK signaling pathway.']"""

In recent years, with the improvement of people's living standards, the incidence of prostate cancer has gradually increased, which has greatly affected people's life and health and quality of life. Acupuncture has its unique advantages in treating cancer pain. We will evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture and moxibustion in the treatment of pain caused by prostate cancer using a clinical randomized parallel control method.  Methods/design:   This pragmatic randomized controlled trial will recruit 120 patients who are diagnosed with prostate cancer. Simple randomization to conventional drug treatment with a 1:1 allocation ratio will be used. Based on the patient's pain location and the primary lesion, the acupuncture needle insertion position was determined according to the principle of local selection of acupoints. All participants will continue to receive conventional drug treatment.

To assess PCa awareness and screening practice among Kenyan men (age: 15-54 years), a cross-sectional study was carried out using Kenya Demographic Health Survey (KDHS 2014) data. A subsample of 12 803 men was taken and analyzed using SPSS version 22. Overall, 7926 (61.9%) men were aware of PCa. Three hundred eleven (3.9%) men who were aware of PCa reported ever screening for PCa. A strong association was found by crude and adjusted logistic regression analysis between men's awareness and age categories [age: 25-34 years, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.32-1.73, P < 0.001; age: 35-44 years, 95% CI = 1.51-2.08, P < 0.001; age: 45-54 years, 95% CI = 1.70-2.44, P < 0.001] compared with men in the age category of 15-24 years. Similarly, an association was observed in men with insurance coverage with awareness (95% CI = 1.35-1.76, P < 0.001) and with screening practice (95% CI = 1.35-2.37, P < 001). Compared with illiterate men, men with primary education (95% CI = 1.82-2.72, P < 001), secondary education (95% CI = 3.84-5.89, P < 001), and higher education (95% CI = 9.93-17.38, P < 0.001) were more likely to be aware of PCa. Sociodemographically, richer (95% CI = 1.36-1.79, P < 0.001) and richest (95% CI = 1.62-2.27, P < 0.001) men were more likely to be aware of PCa than those in the poorest wealth index category. The awareness of Kenyan men of PCa is good. However, the PCa screening practice among Kenyan men is very poor. Hence, health promotion in a PCa screening program should be strengthened to improve public understanding about PCa, available screening tests, and the importance of early PCa screening.""","""['Asfaw N Erena', 'Guanxin Shen', 'Ping Lei']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer Prev""","""['Awareness and Attitudes of Nigerian Men Living in Abuja on Prostate Cancer and Screening.', 'Improvement of Knowledge, Attitudes, and Beliefs of African American Men Toward Prostate Cancer Screening.', 'Knowledge, attitudes and screening practices regarding prostatic diseases among men older than 40 years: a population-based study in Southwest Nigeria.', 'Enhancing public awareness and practice of prostate cancer screening among African men: A scoping review.', 'Promoting Testicular Cancer Awareness and Screening: A Systematic Review of Interventions.']"""

One explanation is that 5α-reductase inhibitors induce morphological changes in prostate cancer cells similar to higher Gleason grades but without its adverse biology. We compared risk of prostate cancer death between men on 5α-reductase inhibitors and men not on 5α-reductase inhibitors before prostate cancer diagnosis in each Gleason Grade Group.  Materials and methods:   Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden consists of linkages between the National Prostate Cancer Register, the Prescribed Drug Registry and the Cause of Death Registry. Of 89,227 men diagnosed with prostate cancer between July 2007 and December 2016, 5,816 had been on 5α-reductase inhibitors for more than 180 days before the date of diagnosis. Followup ended in December 2018. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess hazard ratio for prostate cancer death. Adjustments for age, comorbidity, education and curative treatment were made. Men with high risk cancer were stratified according to Gleason Grade Group.  Results:   In men with high risk cancer the risk of prostate cancer death was similar among 5α-reductase inhibitor users and nonusers, with Gleason Grade Group 1 HR 1.02 (95% CI 0.53-1.95), Gleason Grade Group 2 HR 1.04 (95% CI 0.65-1.69), Gleason Grade Group 3 HR 1.27 (95% CI 0.89-1.80), Gleason Grade Group 4 HR 0.95 (95% CI 0.76-1.18) and Gleason Grade Group 5 HR 0.99 (95% CI 0.83-1.19), for 5α-reductase inhibitor users vs nonusers.

We quantified the risk of prostate cancer metastasis and mortality, and other cause mortality across key clinical predictors.  Materials and methods:   We analyzed 1,225 men with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy from 2001 to 2017 in the VA SEARCH database. Multivariable competing risks regression was used to identify predictors and quantify cumulative incidence of metastasis, prostate cancer specific mortality and other cause mortality. Recursive partitioning analysis was used to identify optimum variable cut points for prediction of prostate cancer specific mortality and other cause mortality.  Results:   During a median followup of 5.6 years after biochemical recurrence (IQR 2.7-9.1), 243 (20%) men died of other causes and 68 (6%) died of prostate cancer. Multivariable competing risks regression showed that high D'Amico tumor risk and prostate specific antigen doubling time at biochemical recurrence less than 9 months were associated with metastasis and prostate cancer specific mortality (p ≤0.001). Ten-year prostate cancer specific mortality was 14% and 9% for those with high risk tumors and prostate specific antigen doubling time less than 9 months, respectively. Advanced age and worse comorbidity were associated with other cause mortality (p ≤0.001). Ten-year other cause mortality was higher among men 70 years old or older with any Charlson comorbidity (1-3+) (40% to 49%) compared to those with none (20%). Recursive partitioning analysis identified optimal variable cut points for prediction of prostate cancer specific mortality and other cause mortality, with 10-year prostate cancer specific mortality ranging from 3% to 59% and 10-year other cause mortality ranging from 17% to 50% across risk subgroups.  Conclusions:   Among men with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy, there is significant heterogeneity in prognosis that can be explained by available clinical variables. Men in their 70s with any major comorbidity are 2 to 10 times more likely to die of other causes than of prostate cancer.""","""['Timothy J Daskivich', 'Lauren E Howard', 'Christopher L Amling', 'William J Aronson', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Christopher J Kane', 'Zachary Klaassen', 'Martha K Terris', 'Stephen J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Does Early Prostate Specific Antigen Doubling Time after Radical Prostatectomy, Calculated Prior to Prostate Specific Antigen Recurrence, Correlate with Prostate Cancer Outcomes?

Design:   A constructivist grounded theory approach using focus groups to analyse men's social talk about prostate cancer.  Methods:   Data were collected using three focus groups with African-Caribbean, Somali, and White British men. The focus groups were conducted in a location of the men's choice with a focus group facilitator and observer. Four Card Games were given to the men to encourage social talk.  Results:   The African-Caribbean men had the most democratic talk with the use of agreement and disagreement and the Somali men were the most inclusive of others and used the most humour. The White British men were competitive in their talk and the least inclusive of each other's views.  Conclusion:   The Card Games revealed differences in the pattern of talk, which provided insight into how men may use social talk to develop their understanding of prostate cancer risk. This is useful for healthcare professionals as it provides a grounding for structuring discussions with men about prostate cancer, while understanding of how risk-related knowledge may be reconstructed in social talk and interactions.  Impact:   The methodology discussed in this paper addressed the use of focus group to analyse talk of men from culturally diverse groups. The use of Card Games allowed the talk between the men to take centre stage and this allowed differences in the social talk of the men to become apparent. The use of this methodology could have an impact on approaches to researching cultural understandings of cancer risk, which may provide evidence on effective delivery of sociocultural relevant health education relating to cancer screening.""","""['Sarah L Fry', 'Daniel Kelly', 'Jane Hopkinson']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Adv Nurs""","""['""We\'re talking about black men here, there\'s a difference""; cultural differences in socialised knowledge of prostate cancer risk: A qualitative research study.', 'Cancer through black eyes - The views of UK based black men towards cancer: A constructivist grounded theory study.', ""African and Afro-Caribbean men's experiences of prostate cancer."", 'Perceptions of prostate cancer in Black African and Black Caribbean men: a systematic review of the literature.', 'Life after prostate cancer: A systematic literature review and thematic synthesis of the post-treatment experiences of Black African and Black Caribbean men.']"""

Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) using 68Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen (68Ga-PSMA) is a novel technique for intraoperative margin assessment. The aim of this first-in-man study was to investigate the feasibility of intraoperative 68Ga-PSMA CLI. In this study, feasibility was defined as the ability to distinguish between a positive and negative surgical margin, imaging within 45 min and low radiation exposure to staff.  Methods:   Six patients were included in this ongoing study. Following perioperative i.v. injection of ~ 100 MBq 68Ga-PSMA, the prostate was excised and immediately imaged ex vivo. Different acquisition protocols were tested, and hotspots on CLI images from the intact prostate were marked for comparison with histopathology.  Results:   By using an acquisition protocol with 150 s exposure time, 8 × 8 binning and a 550 nm shortpass filter, PSMs and negative surgical margins (NSMs) were visually correctly identified on CLI in 3 of the 5 patients. Two patients had a hotspot on CLI from cancer < 0.1 mm from the excision margin.  Conclusion:   Overall, the study showed that 68Ga-PSMA CLI is a feasible and low-risk technique for intraoperative margin assessment in PCa.

Treatment of glioma-bearing mice with proapoptotic PL3-guided NWs improved the survival of the mice, whereas treatment with untargeted particles had no effect. PL3-coated nanoparticles were found to accumulate in TNC-C and NRP-1-positive areas in clinical tumor samples, suggesting a translational relevance.

Using a simple, rapid, and environmentally friendly microwave-assisted protocol, we have synthesized a number of 3,5-bis(styryl)pyrazoles 2a-l, thus allowing for their screening for antiproliferative activity in the androgen-independent PC3 prostate cancer cell line. Surprisingly, two of these structurally simple 3,5-bis(styryl)pyrazoles (2a and 2l) had concentrations which gave 50% of the maximal inhibition of cell proliferation (GI50) in the low micromolar range in the PC3 cell line and were thus selected for extensive further biologic evaluation (apoptosis and cell cycle analysis, and effects on tubulin and microtubules). Our findings from these studies show that 3,5-bis[(1E)-2(2,6-dichlorophenyl)ethenyl]-1H-pyrazole 2l 1) caused significant effects on the cell cycle in PC3 cells, with the vast majority of treated cells in the G2/M phase (89%); 2) induces cell death in PC3 cells even after the removal of the compound; 3) binds to tubulin [dissociation constant (Kd) 0.4 ± 0.1 μM] and inhibits tubulin polymerization in vitro; 4) had no effect upon the polymerization of the bacterial cell division protein FtsZ (a homolog of tubulin); 5) is competitive with paclitaxel for binding to tubulin but not with vinblastine, crocin, or colchicine; and 6) leads to microtubule depolymerization in PC3 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that 3,5-bis(styryl)pyrazoles warrant further investigation as lead compounds for the treatment of CRPC. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The taxanes are important components of prostate cancer chemotherapy regimens, but their oral administration is hampered by very low and highly variable oral bioavailabilities resulting from their poor absorption, poor solubility, high first-pass metabolism, and efficient efflux by P-glycoprotein. New chemical entities for the treatment of prostate cancer are thus required, and we report here the synthesis and investigation of the mechanism of action of some bis(styryl)pyrazoles, demonstrating their potential as lead compounds for the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Vivian W Y Liao', 'Anuradha Kumari', 'Rajeshwar Narlawar', 'Soma Vignarajan', 'David E Hibbs', 'Dulal Panda', 'Paul W Groundwater']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Pharmacol""","""['Repurposing of phentolamine as a potential anticancer agent against human castration-resistant prostate cancer: A central role on microtubule stabilization and mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.', 'Synthesis and bioevaluation of diarylpyrazoles as antiproliferative agents.', 'Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of a novel tubulin inhibitor 7a3 targeting the colchicine binding site.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Taxane- and epothilone-based chemotherapy: from molecule cargo cytoskeletal logistics to management of castration-resistant prostate carcinoma.', 'Small ankyrin 1 (sANK1) promotes docetaxel resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells by enhancing oxidative phosphorylation.', ""Discovery of 2',6-Bis(4-hydroxybenzyl)-2-acetylcyclohexanone, a Novel FtsZ Inhibitor."", 'Styrylpyrazoles: Properties, Synthesis and Transformations.']"""

The role of clinical variables and distinctive SERS spectra in the prediction of GG upgrade were evaluated. Principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA) were used to manage spectral data and develop diagnostic algorithms.  Results:   A total of 342 preoperative serum SERS spectra from 114 patients were obtained. SERS detected a higher level of circulating free nucleic acid bases and a lower level of lipids in patients with GG upgrade to GG3 and higher, presenting as SERS spectral peaks of 728 cm-1 and 1,655 cm-1, respectively.

Comparing U.S-born African Americans with African and Afro-Caribbean immigrants may highlight specific cancer prevention and control needs and clarify global cancer epidemiology. Such a comparison has yet to be undertaken on a population basis.  Methods:   Using 2012-2017 vital statistics data from California, Florida, Minnesota and New York, age-standardized cancer mortality rates were computed for distinct Black populations. Comparisons were made to the majority White population using mortality rate ratios (MRR) obtained from negative binomial regression.  Results:   Of the 83,460 cancer deaths analyzed among Blacks, nearly 20 % were immigrants. African males and females had the lowest all-sites-combined cancer mortality rates (121 and 99 per 100,000, respectively), African Americans had the highest (232 and 163), while Afro-Caribbean were in between (140 and 106 respectively). The average Black:White MRR was significant for prostate (2.11), endometrial (2.05), stomach (2.02), multiple myeloma (1.87), premenopausal breast (1.66), liver (1.58) and cervical (1.56) cancers, (P < 0.05).  Conclusion:   While, in aggregate, Blacks in the US have high cancer mortality rates, race itself is not the primary determinant of these disparities. Black immigrant populations show lower cancer mortality than both African Americans and Whites, especially for cancers where environmental factors feature more predominantly: lung, colorectal and breast. Even for cancers with high mortality among all African-descent groups, this study suggests a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Endometrial cancer was unique; mortality rates were similarly high for all three analyzed Black groups.""","""['Paulo S Pinheiro', 'Heidy Medina', 'Karen E Callahan', 'Deukwoo Kwon', 'Camille Ragin', 'Recinda Sherman', 'Erin N Kobetz', 'Ahmedin Jemal']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol""","""['Black Heterogeneity in Cancer Mortality: US-Blacks, Haitians, and Jamaicans.', 'Prescription Drug Misuse among African Americans and Afro Caribbeans: Results from the National Survey of American Life.', 'Influence of nativity on cancer mortality among black New Yorkers.', 'Beyond the black box: a systematic review of breast, prostate, colorectal, and cervical screening among native and immigrant African-descent Caribbean populations.', 'Differences in cancer incidence, mortality, and survival between African Americans and whites.', 'Assessment of Colorectal Cancer Risk Factors through the Application of Network-Based Approaches in a Racially Diverse Cohort of Colon Organoid Stem Cells.', 'Global disparities in patients with multiple myeloma: a rapid evidence assessment.', 'Differences in Cervical Cancer Outcomes by Caribbean Nativity in Black and White Women in Florida.', 'Lung Cancer Incidence by Detailed Race-Ethnicity.', 'Investigating the Association between Educational Attainment and Allostatic Load with Risk of Cancer Mortality among African American Women.']"""

In this retrospective analysis, we will assess whether the docetaxel DI used in patients with metastatic castrate-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) is associated with overall survival (OS).  Methods:   All patients with mCSPC treated at The Ottawa Hospital Cancer Centre that received docetaxel chemotherapy between June 2014 and September 2017 were identified. The association between relative dose intensity (RDI) and OS was assessed using univariate and multivariable Cox model adjusting for age, Gleason score, burden of disease, visceral involvement, de novo metastases and baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA).  Results:   Eighty-one patients were included in the analysis. Only 35 patients (43%) were able to complete the planned treatment with a RDI of at least 90%. On a univariate analysis, higher RDI and number of cycles of docetaxel received were associated with longer OS. For every 10% decrease in RDI, the risk of death increased by 23% (HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.09-1.4, P = 0.001). For every increment of one cycle (and up to six), the risk of death decreased by 27% (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61-0.88, P = 0.001). On multivariate analysis, reduced RDI was the only predictor significantly associated with OS (HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02-1.36, P = 0.026).

However, it is still unclear whether radium-223 may induce skeletal fragility regardless of other therapies for CRPC. We aimed at evaluating the prevalence, incidence, and determinants of vertebral fractures (VFs), i.e., the most frequent complication of skeletal fragility, in CRCP patients undergoing radium-223 therapy in the real-life clinical practice.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 49 CRPC patients with symptomatic bone metastases treated with radium-223. Patients received median number of four radium-223 doses (range: 2-6) and were followed-up for a median period of 11 months (range: 6-44). VFs were assessed by a quantitative morphometry using lateral images of spine 11C-Choline PET/CT, excluding from the analysis the vertebral bodies affected by bone metastases.  Results:   Before radium-223 administration, 24 patients (49%) had VFs significantly associated with duration of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT; odds ratio 1.29) and previous abiraterone therapy (odds ratio 3.80). During radium-223 therapy, incident VFs occurred in 25% of patients, in relationship with prevalent VFs (hazard ratio 6.89) and change in serum total alkaline phosphatase values (hazard ratio 0.97), whereas the correlations with ADT and abiraterone therapy were lost. Noteworthy, the risk of VFs did not correlate with the therapeutic end points of radium-223.

Herein, we report a dual-round signal amplification strategy for colorimetric/fluorescence/photoacoustic triple read-out detection of PSA using a silica coated Au@Ag core-shell nanorod (denoted Au@Ag@SiO2) based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system. In the presence of PSA, monoclonal primary antihuman PSA antibody (Ab1) captured PSA and was subsequently recognized by the secondary antihuman PSA detection antibody (Ab2) which was conjugated with glucose oxidase (GOx) functionalized magnetic beads (MBs) for signal amplification, then GOx catalyses the addition of glucose to generate hydrogen peroxide that etches the silver layer in Au@Ag@SiO2, thus producing abundant Ag+ to realize the second signal amplification. With the degradation of the silver layer, an obvious color change (green-to-pink) of the Au@Ag@SiO2 solution could be observed by the naked eye and its surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption had a red-shift, enhancing photoacoustic signal read-out at 780 nm.

Here we produced and analysed whole-genome, whole-transcriptome and DNA methylation data for 208 pairs of tumour tissue samples and matched healthy control tissue from Chinese patients with primary prostate cancer. Systematic comparison with published data from 2,554 prostate tumours revealed that the genomic alteration signatures in Chinese patients were markedly distinct from those of Western cohorts: specifically, 41% of tumours contained mutations in FOXA1 and 18% each had deletions in ZNF292 and CHD1. Alterations of the genome and epigenome were correlated and were predictive of disease phenotype and progression.

Prostate cancer (PCa) cells were identified to secrete greater concentration of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) compared to noncancer epithelia. Based on the recognized coevolution of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) with tumor progression, we tested the role of cancer-derived mtDNA in a mechanism of paracrine signaling. We found that prostatic CAF expressed DEC205, which was not expressed by normal tissue-associated fibroblasts. DEC205 is a transmembrane protein that bound mtDNA and contributed to pattern recognition by Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). Complement C3 was the dominant gene targeted by TLR9-induced NF-κB signaling in CAF. The subsequent maturation complement C3 maturation to anaphylatoxin C3a was dependent on PCa epithelial inhibition of catalase in CAF. In a syngeneic tissue recombination model of PCa and associated fibroblast, the antagonism of the C3a receptor and the fibroblastic knockout of TLR9 similarly resulted in immune suppression with a significant reduction in tumor progression, compared to saline-treated tumors associated with wild-type prostatic fibroblasts. Interestingly, docetaxel, a common therapy for advanced PCa, further promoted mtDNA secretion in cultured epithelia, mice, and PCa patients. The antiapoptotic signaling downstream of anaphylatoxin C3a signaling in tumor cells contributed to docetaxel resistance. The inhibition of C3a receptor sensitized PCa epithelia to docetaxel in a synergistic manner. Tumor models of human PCa epithelia with CAF expanded similarly in mice in the presence or absence of docetaxel. The combination therapy of docetaxel and C3 receptor antagonist disrupted the mtDNA/C3a paracrine loop and restored docetaxel sensitivity.""","""['Subhash Haldar', 'Rajeev Mishra', 'Sandrine Billet', 'Manish Thiruvalluvan', 'Veronica R Placencio-Hickok', 'Anisha Madhav', 'Frank Duong', 'Bryan Angara', 'Priyanka Agarwal', 'Mourad Tighiouart', 'Edwin M Posadas', 'Neil A Bhowmick']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Overexpression of SLC6A1 associates with drug resistance and poor prognosis in prostate cancer.', 'Activation of mutated TRPA1 ion channel by resveratrol in human prostate cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF).', 'Inhibition of Nox4-dependent ROS signaling attenuates prostate fibroblast activation and abrogates stromal-mediated protumorigenic interactions.', 'Fibroblast heterogeneity in prostate carcinogenesis.', 'Cancer-Associated Fibroblast: Role in Prostate Cancer Progression to Metastatic Disease and Therapeutic Resistance.', 'Identification of cancer-associated fibroblasts subtypes in prostate cancer.', 'Mitochondrial Alterations in Prostate Cancer: Roles in Pathobiology and Racial Disparities.', 'Inside-Out of Complement in Cancer.', 'Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) gene deletion-mediated fracture healing in type II diabetic osteoporosis associates with inhibition of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway.', 'Myeloid Responses to Extracellular Vesicles in Health and Disease.']"""

To address these issues, we developed MEDICASCY, a multilabel-based boosted random forest machine learning method that only requires the small molecule's chemical structure for the drug side effect, indication, efficacy, and probable mode of action target predictions; however, it has comparable or even significantly better performance than existing approaches requiring far more information. In retrospective benchmarking on high confidence predictions, MEDICASCY shows about 78% precision and recall for predicting at least one severe side effect and 72% precision drug efficacy. Experimental validation of MEDICASCY's efficacy predictions on novel molecules shows close to 80% precision for the inhibition of growth in ovarian, breast, and prostate cancer cell lines.

Overall, 38 patients (37%) had a history of radiation therapy. There was no difference in time to recurrence for primary vs repeat VUAS treatment, previous vs no radiation, TR compared to TI (all p > 0.08). Regarding treatment success, no difference was found for primary vs. repeat VUAS treatment (50% vs. 37%), previous radiation vs. no radiation (42% vs. 43%), and TR vs. TI (37% vs. 53%; all p ≥ 0.1). Postoperative de novo incontinence was more common after TI vs. TR (31% vs. 12%; p = 0.032), no difference was observed for previous radiation therapy vs. no radiation therapy (18% vs. 18%; p > 0.9) or primary vs. repeat VUAS treatment (22% vs. 16%; p = 0.5).  Conclusion:   VUAS recurrence after endoscopic treatment is not predictable. Endoscopic treatment with TI showed a higher risk for de novo incontinence than TR, and previous irradiation and the number of treatments do not influence incontinence.""","""['D Pfalzgraf', 'T Worst', 'J Kranz', 'J Steffens', 'G Salomon', 'M Fisch', 'C P Reiß', 'M W Vetterlein', 'C M Rosenbaum']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Surgical and Functional Outcomes of Bladder Neck Incision for Primary Vesico-Urethral Anastomosis Stricture after Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy are Influenced by the Presence of Pre- or Postoperative Radiotherapy.', 'Dorsal Buccal Mucosal Graft Urethroplasty for Vesico-Urethral Anastomotic Stricture Postradical Prostatectomy.', 'Treatment of recurrent vesicourethral anastomotic stricture after radical prostatectomy using plasma-button vaporization.', 'Anastomosis stenosis after radical prostatectomy and bladder neck stenosis after benign prostate hyperplasia treatment: reconstructive options.', 'Management of Urethral Stricture and Bladder Neck Contracture Following Primary and Salvage Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'The effect of proliferative hypertrophic scars on determining treatment options for preventing recurrence of vesicourethral anastomotic stenosis after radical prostatectomy: a single-center cross-sectional study.', 'Contemporary Management of Vesico-Urethral Anastomotic Stenosis After Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

To understand the mechanisms underlying this failure, the present study investigated biomarkers associated with the lower overall survival (OS) among 2,588 patients receiving personalized peptide vaccination (PPV). Survival data were obtained from a database of 2,588 cancer patients including 399 patients with lung, 354 with prostate and 344 with colon cancer. They entered into phase II clinical trials of PPV in which 2 to 4 of 31 warehouse peptides were selected for vaccination on an individual patient basis based on human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class IA‑types and pre‑existing peptide‑specific IgG levels. Higher pre‑vaccination neutrophil, monocyte and platelet counts, and lower pre‑vaccination lymphocyte and red blood cell counts were inversely associated with OS, with higher sensitivities in the proportions of neutrophils and lymphocytes, respectively. The most potent unfavorable and favorable factors for OS were the median percentage of neutrophils (≥64.8%) or percentage of lymphocytes (≥25.1%) with correlation coefficients (R2) of 0.98 and 0.92, respectively. Higher pre‑vaccination levels of c‑reactive protein and other inflammatory soluble factors were inversely associated with OS. Pre‑vaccination peptide‑specific immunity levels had no effect on OS, although lower immune boosting levels were inversely associated with OS. None of the 31 peptides was inversely associated with OS, although a few peptides were positively associated with it. On the whole, the findings of the present study suggested that pre‑vaccination inflammatory signatures, but not those of post‑vaccination immune induction, were associated with lower clinical benefits of PPV.""","""['Shigetaka Suekane', 'Shigeru Yutani', 'Akira Yamada', 'Tetsuro Sasada', 'Satoko Matsueda', 'Shinzo Takamori', 'Uhi Toh', 'Kouichiro Kawano', 'Koichi Yoshiyama', 'Shinjiro Sakamoto', 'Shunichi Sugawara', 'Nobukazu Komatsu', 'Teppei Yamada', 'Masayasu Naito', 'Mizuhiko Terasaki', 'Takashi Mine', 'Kyogo Itoh', 'Shigeki Shichijo', 'Masanori Noguchi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['A randomized, double-blind, phase III trial of personalized peptide vaccination for recurrent glioblastoma.', 'A randomized phase III trial of personalized peptide vaccination for castration‑resistant prostate cancer progressing after docetaxel.', 'A phase II trial of personalized peptide vaccination in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients: prolongation of prostate-specific antigen doubling time.', 'Personalized peptide vaccination: a new approach for advanced cancer as therapeutic cancer vaccine.', 'Personalized peptide vaccine for treatment of advanced cancer.', 'Immune responses of patients without cancer recurrence after a cancer vaccine over a long term.']"""

However, patients often do not know this information, preventing them from using the tools and understanding their prognosis.  Objective:   To develop and validate a prognostic survival model for all cancer types that incorporates information on symptoms and performance status over time.  Design, setting, and participants:   This is a retrospective, population-based, prognostic study of data from patients diagnosed with cancer from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2015, in Ontario, Canada. Patients were randomly selected for model derivation (60%) and validation (40%). The derivation cohort was used to develop a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model with baseline characteristics under a backward stepwise variable selection process to predict the risk of mortality as a function of time. Covariates included demographic characteristics, clinical information, symptoms and performance status, and health care use. Model performance was assessed on the validation cohort by C statistics and calibration plots. Data analysis was performed from February 6, 2018, to November 6, 2019.  Main outcomes and measures:   Time to death from diagnosis (year 0) recalculated at each of 4 annual survivor marks after diagnosis (up to year 4).  Results:   A total of 255 494 patients diagnosed with cancer were identified (135 699 [53.1%] female; median age, 65 years [interquartile range, 55-73 years]). The cohort decreased to 217 055, 184 822, 143 649, and 109 569 patients for each of the 4 years after diagnosis. In the derivation cohort year 0, and the most common cancers were breast (30 855 [20.1%]), lung (19 111 [12.5%]), and prostate (18 404 [12.0%]). A total of 47 614 (31.1%) had stage III or IV disease. The mean (SD) time to death in year 0 was 567 (715) days. After backward stepwise selection in year 0, the following factors were associated with increased risk of death by more than 10%: being hospitalized; having congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or dementia; having moderate to high pain; having worse well-being; having functional status in the transitional or end-of-life phase; having any problems with appetite; receiving end-of-life home care; and living in a nursing home. Model discrimination was high for all models (C statistic: 0.902 [year 0], 0.912 [year 1], 0.912 [year 2], 0.909 [year 3], and 0.908 [year 4]).  Conclusions and relevance:   The model accurately predicted changing cancer survival risk over time using clinical, symptom, and performance status data and appears to have the potential to be a useful prognostic tool that can be completed by patients. This knowledge may support earlier integration of palliative care.""","""['Hsien Seow', 'Peter Tanuseputro', 'Lisa Barbera', 'Craig Earle', 'Dawn Guthrie', 'Sarina Isenberg', 'Rosalyn Juergens', 'Jeffrey Myers', 'Melissa Brouwers', 'Rinku Sutradhar']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['The Uncertain Science of Predicting Death.', 'Development and validation of a prediction model of poor performance status and severe symptoms over time in cancer patients (PROVIEW+).', 'Development and Validation of the Chronic Disease Population Risk Tool (CDPoRT) to Predict Incidence of Adult Chronic Disease.', 'Mortality in Incident Maintenance Dialysis Patients Versus Incident Solid Organ Cancer Patients: A Population-Based Cohort.', 'Trends in the prevalence of malignancy among patients admitted with acute heart failure and associated outcomes: a nationwide population-based study.', 'Quality of life data as prognostic indicators of survival in cancer patients: an overview of the literature from 1982 to 2008.', 'Behavioural economic interventions to embed palliative care in community oncology (BE-EPIC): study protocol for the BE-EPIC randomised controlled trial.', 'myBeST-A Web-Based Survival Prognostic Tool for Women with Breast Cancer in Malaysia: Development Process and Preliminary Validation Study.', 'Comparing machine learning approaches to incorporate time-varying covariates in predicting cancer survival time.', 'Identification and Prognostication of End-of-Life State Using a Japanese Guideline-Based Diagnostic Method: A Diagnostic Accuracy Study.', 'Development of Predictive Models for Survival among Women with Breast Cancer in Malaysia.']"""

The nanocomplex revealed a crystalline form, and exhibited higher lipophilicity, compared to TPZ. Furthermore, its stability was confirmed in different media, with minimum dissociation in serum (∼20% up to 72 h). In contrast to other hypoxia-targeted agents, our intrinsically fluorescent nanocomplex offered an invaluable tool to monitor its cellular uptake and intracellular distribution under both normoxia and hypoxia. The conferred higher cellular uptake of the nanocomplex, especially under hypoxia, and its biocompatible reductive potential resulted in superior hypoxia selectivity in two prostate cancer (PC) cell lines. More promisingly, the nanocomplex showed higher potency in three-dimensional tumor spheroids, compared to TPZ, due to its slower metabolism, and probably deeper penetration in tumor spheroids. Interestingly, the nuclear localization of the intact nanocomplex, combined with its higher DNA binding affinity, as evidenced by the DNA binding assay, resulted in significant S-phase cell-cycle arrest, followed by apoptosis in the three-dimensional spheroid model. In conclusion, the presented findings suggested that the Cu(TPZ)2 nanocomplex can be a promising hypoxia-targeted therapeutic, which could potentiate the efficacy of the existing chemo- and radiotherapy in PC.""","""['Vera L Silva', 'Abdessamad Kaassis', 'Ashkan Dehsorkhi', 'Cédrik-Roland Koffi', 'Maja Severic', 'Moustafa Abdelhamid', 'Duuamene Nyimanu', 'Christopher J Morris', ""Wafa' T Al-Jamal""]""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Biomater Sci""","""['Hypoxia-targeted cupric-tirapazamine liposomes potentiate radiotherapy in prostate cancer spheroids.', 'Extravascular diffusion of tirapazamine: effect of metabolic consumption assessed using the multicellular layer model.', 'Subcellular Location of Tirapazamine Reduction Dramatically Affects Aerobic but Not Anoxic Cytotoxicity.', 'Hypoxic sensitizer and cytotoxin for head and neck cancer.', 'Tirapazamine: laboratory data relevant to clinical activity.', 'Synergic Antitumor Effect of Photodynamic Therapy and Chemotherapy Mediated by Nano Drug Delivery Systems.', 'A tumor microenvironment-responsive poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoplatform for hypoxia-responsive chemo/chemodynamic therapy.', 'Combining Nanocarrier-Assisted Delivery of Molecules and Radiotherapy.', 'Characterizing Endocrine Status, Tumor Hypoxia and Immunogenicity for Therapy Success in Epithelial Ovarian Cancer.', 'Photoactivatable nanogenerators of reactive species for cancer therapy.']"""

Zearalenone (ZEA) is one of the most common mycotoxins contaminating food, which might mimic estrogens and bind to estrogen receptors (ERs). The ratio of androgens to estrogens in men decreases physiologically with age, and is believed to participate in prostate carcinogenesis. In this study, we evaluated the role of NFκB and ERβ in the induction of oxidative stress in human PCa cells by ZEA. As observed, ZEA at a dose of 30 µM induces oxidative stress in PCa cells associated with DNA damage and G2/M cell cycle arrest. We also observed that the inhibition of ERβ and NFΚB via specific inhibitors (PHTPP and BAY 117082) significantly increased ZEA-induced oxidative stress, although the mechanism seems to be different for androgen-dependent and androgen-independent cells. Based on our findings, it is possible that the activation of ERβ and NFΚB in PCa might protect cancer cells from ZEA-induced oxidative stress. We therefore shed new light on the mechanism of ZEA toxicity in human cells.""","""['Karolina Kowalska', 'Dominika Ewa Habrowska-Górczyńska', 'Kamila Domińska', 'Kinga Anna Urbanek', 'Agnieszka Wanda Piastowska-Ciesielska']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Toxins (Basel)""","""['Estrogen receptor β plays a protective role in zearalenone-induced oxidative stress in normal prostate epithelial cells.', 'Bakuchiol exhibits anti-metastasis activity through NF-κB cross-talk signaling with AR and ERβ in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells PC-3.', 'Estrogen Receptor α Is Crucial in Zearalenone-Induced Invasion and Migration of Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Zearalenone Promotes Cell Proliferation or Causes Cell Death?', 'Estrogen and prostate cancer: an eclipsed truth in an androgen-dominated scenario.', 'Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals and Disease Endpoints.', 'Comparative Analysis of Transcriptomic Changes including mRNA and microRNA Expression Induced by the Xenoestrogens Zearalenone and Bisphenol A in Human Ovarian Cells.', 'Ex Vivo and In Vitro Studies Revealed Underlying Mechanisms of Immature Intestinal Inflammatory Responses Caused by Aflatoxin M1 Together with Ochratoxin A.', 'Estrogen Receptor β Participates in Alternariol-Induced Oxidative Stress in Normal Prostate Epithelial Cells.', 'Zearalenone and the Immune Response.']"""

Promising conversion results have been demonstrated recently using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs). However, the performance is generally only tested on images from one MR scanner, which neglects the potential of neural networks to find general high-level abstract features. In this study, we explored the generalizability of the generator models, trained on a single field strength scanner, to data acquired with higher field strengths. T2-weighted 0.35T MRIs and CTs from 51 patients treated for prostate (40) and cervical cancer (11) were included. 25 of them were used to train four different generators (SE-ResNet, DenseNet, U-Net, and Embedded Net). Further, an ensemble model was created from the four network outputs. The models were validated on 16 patients from a 0.35T MR scanner. Further, the trained models were tested on the Gold Atlas dataset, containing T2-weighted MR scans of different field strengths; 1.5T(7) and 3T(12), and 10 patients from the 0.35T scanner. The sCTs were dosimetrically compared using clinical VMAT plans for all test patients. For the same scanner (0.35T), the results from the different models were comparable on the test set, with only minor differences in the mean absolute error (MAE) (35-51HU body). Similar results were obtained for conversions of 3T GE Signa and the 3T GE Discovery images (40-62HU MAE) for three of the models. However, larger differences were observed for the 1.5T images (48-65HU MAE). The overall best model was found to be the ensemble model. All dose differences were below 1%. This study shows that it is possible to generalize models trained on images of one scanner to other scanners and different field strengths. The best metric results were achieved by the combination of all networks.""","""['Lukas Fetty', 'Tommy Löfstedt', 'Gerd Heilemann', 'Hugo Furtado', 'Nicole Nesvacil', 'Tufve Nyholm', 'Dietmar Georg', 'Peter Kuess']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Generation of abdominal synthetic CTs from 0.35T MR images using generative adversarial networks for MR-only liver radiotherapy.', 'Dosimetric evaluation of synthetic CT for head and neck radiotherapy generated by a patch-based three-dimensional convolutional neural network.', 'Shape constrained fully convolutional DenseNet with adversarial training for multiorgan segmentation on head and neck CT and low-field MR images.', 'Deep learning approaches using 2D and 3D convolutional neural networks for generating male pelvic synthetic computed tomography from magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Patch-based generative adversarial neural network models for head and neck MR-only planning.', 'Synthetic CT generation for MRI-guided adaptive radiotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'Structurally-constrained optical-flow-guided adversarial generation of synthetic CT for MR-only radiotherapy treatment planning.', 'Efficient full Monte Carlo modelling and multi-energy generative model development of an advanced X-ray device.', 'An MRI sequence independent convolutional neural network for synthetic head CT generation in proton therapy.', 'Synthetic CT Generation of the Pelvis in Patients With Cervical Cancer: A Single Input Approach Using Generative Adversarial Network.']"""

In a multi-institutional prospective trial, we investigated whether real-time IGRT improved the accuracy of the dose patients with prostate cancer received during radiation therapy.  Methods and materials:   Forty-eight patients with prostate cancer were treated with KIM-guided SABR with 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions. During KIM-guided treatment, the prostate motion was corrected for by either beam gating with couch shifts or multileaf collimator tracking. A dose reconstruction method was used to evaluate the dose delivered to the target and organs at risk with and without real-time IGRT. Primary outcome was the effect of real-time IGRT on dose distributions. Secondary outcomes included patient-reported outcomes and toxicity.  Results:   Motion correction occurred in ≥1 treatment for 88% of patients (42 of 48) and 51% of treatments (121 of 235). With real-time IGRT, no treatments had prostate clinical target volume (CTV) D98% dose 5% less than planned. Without real-time IGRT, 13 treatments (5.5%) had prostate CTV D98% doses 5% less than planned. The prostate CTV D98% dose with real-time IGRT was closer to the plan by an average of 1.0% (range, -2.8% to 20.3%).

Semiparametric mixture regression models have become a prominent approach in competing risks analysis due to their flexibility and easy interpretation of resultant estimates. The literature presents several semiparametric methods on the estimations for mixture Cox proportional hazards models, but fewer works appear on the determination of the number of model components and the estimation of baseline hazard functions using kernel approaches. These two issues are important because both incorrect number of components and inappropriate baseline functions can lead to insufficient estimates of mixture Cox hazard models. This research thus proposes four validity indices to select the optimal number of model components based on the posterior probabilities and residuals resulting from the application of an EM-based algorithm on a mixture Cox regression model. We also introduce a kernel approach to produce a smooth estimate of the baseline hazard function in a mixture model. The effectiveness and the preference of the proposed cluster indices are demonstrated through a simulation study.

For example, the primary microRNA-17-92 (pri-miR-17-92) cluster contains six microRNAs (miRNAs) that collectively act in several disease settings. Herein, we used sequence-based design of structure-specific ligands to target a common structure in the Dicer processing sites of three miRNAs in the cluster, miR-17, miR-18a, and miR-20a, thereby inhibiting their biogenesis. The compound was optimized to afford a dimeric molecule that binds the Dicer processing site and an adjacent bulge, affording a 100-fold increase in potency. The dimer's mode of action was then extended from simple binding to direct cleavage by conjugation to bleomycin A5 in a manner that imparts RNA-selective cleavage or to indirect cleavage by recruiting an endogenous nuclease, or a ribonuclease targeting chimera (RIBOTAC). Interestingly, the dimer-bleomycin conjugate cleaves the entire pri-miR-17-92 cluster and hence functionally inhibits all six miRNAs emanating from it. The compound selectively reduced levels of the cluster in three disease models: polycystic kidney disease, prostate cancer, and breast cancer, rescuing disease-associated phenotypes in the latter two. Further, the bleomycin conjugate exerted selective effects on the miRNome and proteome in prostate cancer cells. In contrast, the RIBOTAC only depleted levels of pre- and mature miR-17, -18a, and 20a, with no effect on the primary transcript, in accordance with the cocellular localization of RNase L, the pre-miRNA targets, and the compound.

Although the utilization of noncovalent bonding interactions, leading to the generation of excimer/exciplex PL, has been investigated extensively, precise control of the aggregates and their persistence at very low concentrations remains a rare phenomenon. In the search for a fresh approach, we sought to obtain exciplex PL from permanent structures by incorporating anthracene moieties into pyridinium-containing mechanically interlocked molecules. Beyond the optical properties of the anthracene moieties, their π-extended nature enforces [π···π] stacking that can overcome the Coulombic repulsion between the pyridinium units, affording an efficient synthesis of an octacationic homo[2]catenane. Notably, upon increasing the ionic strength by adding tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate, the catenane yield increases significantly as a result of the decrease in Coulombic repulsions between the pyridinium units. Although the ground-state photophysical properties of the free cyclophane and the catenane are similar and show a charge-transfer band at ∼455 nm, their PL characters are distinct, denoting different excited states. The cyclophane emits at ∼562 nm (quantum yield ϕF = 3.6%, emission lifetime τs = 3 ns in MeCN), which is characteristic of a disubstituted anthracene-pyridinium linker.

Methods:   This prospective study included 180 patients with escalated levels of PSA (≥4 μg/L) or abnormal results of digital rectal examination. According to the level of PSA, the patients were divided into groups A (PSA ≤10 μg/L, n = 104) and B (PSA >10 μg/L, n = 76), and all underwent intracavitary 3D-CETRUS TUI followed by transperineal prostate biopsy under the guidance of two-dimensional gray-scale ultrasound, which involved a standard 12-core transperineal systematic prostate puncture by intracavitary biplane probe and then a 2-core puncture in the abnormal region displayed by 3D-CETRUS TUI. With the pathological results as the gold standard, comparisons were made between the diagnostic value of 3D-CETRUS TUI-guided biopsy and that of 12-core systematic biopsy.  Results:   Prostate cancer was diagnosed in 69 (38.33%) of the 180 cases and in the specimens from 631 (25.03%) of the 2 520 punctures. The positive rates of prostate cancer were 37.5% (39/104) and 57.9% (44/76) in groups A and B, respectively. 3D-CETRUS TUI-guided prostate biopsy achieved a higher positive rate than 12-core systematic biopsy in both of the groups, with statistically significant difference in group A (P < 0.05), but not in B (P > 0.05).  Conclusions:   For patients with a PSA level ≤10 μg/L, dynamic intracavitary 3D-CETRUS TUI-guided transperineal prostate biopsy is more efficient than 12-core systematic biopsy in detecting the positive lesion, while for those with a PSA level > 10 μg/L, it effectively reduces the number of punctures.""","""['Ming Chen', 'Ning-Jie Huang', 'Zhen-Han Lai', 'Guo-Rong Lü', 'Ji-Guang Zhou', 'Xiao-Yan Chen']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Zhonghua Nan Ke Xue""","""['Pelvic MRI combined with TRUS-guided transperineal template mapping biopsy for the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'The eternal enigma in prostatic biopsy access route.', 'Value of three-section contrast-enhanced transrectal ultrasonography in the detection of prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of prostate specific antigen density and transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsies in 100 consecutive patients with a negative digital rectal examination and intermediate serum prostate specific antigen levels.', 'Contrast-Enhanced Transrectal Ultrasound in Focal Therapy for Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   Center-reported certification and patient survey data from 3094 patients in 44 certified PCCs in Germany were gathered in the observational study (Prostate Cancer Outcomes). A multilevel analysis was conducted.  Results:   Model 1 showed that utilization of POS in PCCs is associated with patients' age (OR = 0.98; 95%-CI = 0.96-0.99; P < .001), number of comorbidities (1-2 vs 0, OR = 1.27; 95%-CI = 1.00-1.60; P=.048), disease staging (localized high-risk vs localized intermediate risk, OR = 1.41; 95%-CI = 1.14-1.74; P < .001), receiving androgen deprivation therapy before study inclusion (OR = 0.19; 95%-CI = 0.10-0.34; P < .001), and hospital teaching status (university vs academic, OR = 0.09; 95%-CI = 0.02-0.55; P = .009). Model 2 additionally includes information on treatment after study inclusion and shows that after inclusion, patients who receive primary radiotherapy (OR = 0.05; 95%-CI = 0.03-0.10; P < .001) or undergo active surveillance/watchful waiting (OR = 0.06; 95%-CI = 0.02-0.15; P < .001) are less likely to utilize POS than patients who undergo radical prostatectomy.

However, ADT is associated with various metabolic disturbances, including impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance and weight gain, increasing risk of diabetes and cardiovascular death. Much remains unknown about the metabolic pathways and disturbances altered by ADT and the mechanisms. We assessed the metabolomic effects of ADT in the serum of 20 men receiving ADT. Sera collected before (baseline), 3 and 6 months after initiation of ADT was used for the metabolomics and lipidomics analyses. The ADT-associated metabolic changes were identified by univariable and multivariable statistical analysis, ANOVA, and Pearson correlation. We found multiple key changes. First, ADT treatments reduced the steroid synthesis as reflected by the lower androgen sulfate and other steroid hormones. Greater androgen reduction was correlated with higher serum glucose levels, supporting the diabetogenic role of ADT. Second, ADT consistently decreased the 3-hydroxybutyric acid and ketogenesis. Third, many acyl-carnitines were reduced, indicating the effects on the fatty acid metabolism. Fourth, ADT was associated with a corresponding reduction in 3-formyl indole (a.k.a. indole-3-carboxaldehyde), a microbiota-derived metabolite from the dietary tryptophan. Indole-3-carboxaldehyde is an agonist for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and regulates the mucosal reactivity and inflammation. Together, these ADT-associated metabolomic analyses identified reduction in steroid synthesis and ketogenesis as prominent features, suggesting therapeutic potential of restricted ketogenic diets, though this requires formal testing. ADT may also impact the microbial production of indoles related to the immune pathways. Future research is needed to determine the functional impact and underlying mechanisms to prevent ADT-linked comorbidities and diabetes risk.""","""['Jen-Tsan Chi', 'Pao-Hwa Lin', 'Vladimir Tolstikov', 'Taofik Oyekunle', 'Emily Y Chen', 'Valerie Bussberg', 'Bennett Greenwood', 'Rangaprasad Sarangarajan', 'Niven R Narain', 'Michael A Kiebish', 'Stephen J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['The influence of low-carbohydrate diets on the metabolic response to androgen-deprivation therapy in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer and metabolic risk for atherosclerosis.', 'Prospective study of changes in the metabolomic profiles of men during their first three months of androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Effect of androgen deprivation therapy on arterial stiffness and serum lipid profile changes in patients with prostate cancer: a prospective study of initial 6-month follow-up.', 'Bone and metabolic health in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer who are receiving androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis Detection and Prediction.', 'Mechanical Properties of 3-Hydroxybutyric Acid-Induced Vesicles.', 'Interaction between gut microbiota and sex hormones and their relation to sexual dimorphism in metabolic diseases.', 'Carbon Ion Radiotherapy Induce Metabolic Inhibition After Functional Imaging-Guided Simultaneous Integrated Boost for Prostate Cancer.', 'Metabolic reprogramming as an emerging mechanism of resistance to endocrine therapies in prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   We conducted an evaluation of the TR vs the TP biopsy approach in the context of 28 days post-procedure complications and readmissions. A secondary evaluation of burden of expenditure in NHS hospitals over the entire decade (2008-2019) was conducted through examination of national Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data.  Results:   In this dataset of 486 467 prostate biopsies (387 879 TR and 98 588 TP biopsies), rates of infection and sepsis were higher for the TR compared to the TP cohort (0.53% vs 0.31%; P < 0.001, confidence interval 99% ). Rates of sepsis have more than doubled for TR biopsies in the last 2 years compared to the previous decade (1.12% vs 0.53%). Infective complications were the main reasons for readmissions in the TR cohort, whereas urinary retention was the predominant reason for readmission in the TP cohort. Over the last decade, non-elective (NEL) readmissions seem higher for the TP group; however, in the last 2 years these have reduced compared to the TR group (3.54% vs 3.74%). The cost estimates for NEL readmissions for the entire decade were £33,589,527.00 and £7,179,926.00 respectively, for TR and TP cohorts (P < 0.001). Estimated costs per patient readmission were £2,225.00 and £1,758.00 in the TR and TP groups (P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Evaluation of nearly half a million prostate biopsies in the NHS over the entire decade gives sufficient evidence for the distinct advantages of the TP route over the TR route in terms of reduced infections and burden of expenditure.

Design:   Semistructured, in-depth individual interviews.  Setting:   Twenty-one academic and nonacademic primary care clinics in Maryland.  Participants:   Thirty primary care clinicians from internal medicine, family medicine, medicine/pediatrics, and geriatric medicine.  Measurements:   Interviews explored whether the clinicians believed that overscreening for breast, colorectal, or prostate cancers existed in older adults and their views on using life expectancy to decide on stopping routine screening. Audio recordings of the interviews were transcribed verbatim. Two investigators independently coded all transcripts using qualitative content analysis.  Results:   Most clinicians were physicians (24/30) and women (16/30). Content analysis generated three major themes. (1) Many, but not all, clinicians perceived overscreening in older adults as a problem. (2) There was controversy around using limited life expectancy to define overscreening due to concerns that the guidelines did not capture potential nonmortality benefits of screening; that population-based screening data could not be easily applied to individuals; that this approach failed to account for patient choice; and that life expectancy predictions were inaccurate. (3) Some clinicians worried that using life expectancy to define overscreening may inadvertently introduce bias and lead to unintended harms.  Conclusions:   Several clinicians disagreed with guideline frameworks of using limited life expectancy to guide cancer screening cessation. Some disagreement stems from inadequate knowledge about the benefits and harms of cancer screening and indicates a need for education or decision support. Other reasons for disagreement highlight the need to refine the current recommended cancer screening approaches and identify strategies to avoid unintended consequences, such as introducing bias or exacerbating existing disparities.

This high rate is due to the difficulty in balancing the risk of extraprostatic disease and excising periprostatic structures, which ultimately affects patients' quality of life. In the case of a PSM, the appropriateness of adjuvant radiation therapy (aRT) should be discussed. The financial burden of PSMs on health systems has not been investigated.  Objective:   To estimate the financial costs associated with a PSM during radical prostatectomy on the basis of the odds of undergoing aRT.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cohort study used data on men with prostate cancer from the US National Cancer Database (January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2015). Data were requested in March 2019, accessed in April 2019, and analyzed in August 2019.  Exposure:   Treatment with radical prostatectomy followed by aRT, if indicated.  Main outcomes and measures:   The attributable risk fraction of PSMs on undergoing aRT was estimated from a logistic regression with aRT administration as the outcome. The analysis was adjusted for patients' socioeconomic and demographic characteristics and tumor characteristics. The aRT cost for the year 2019 was calculated using the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule and the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System. The fraction of this cost attributable to a PSM was estimated according to its attributable risk fraction.  Results:   In total, 230 175 men were identified (median [interquartile range] age at diagnosis, 62.0 [56.0-67.0] years). Overall, 22.8% of the patients had a PSM. Patients with PSMs were more likely than those without PSMs to be older (median [interquartile range] age, 62.0 [56.0-66.0] years vs 62.0 [57.0-67.0] years) and nonwhite (9320 patients [17.8%] vs 29 872 patients [16.8%]), to have higher comorbidity scores (1604 patients [3.1%] vs 4884 patients [2.7%] with a Charlson-Deyo Comorbidity Index score ≥2) and worse tumor characteristics (category T3 and T4 disease, 26 394 patients [50.3%] vs 36 040 patients [20.3%]), and to have lower socioeconomic indicators (median annual income <$30 000, 5708 patients [10.9%] vs 17 874 patients [10.1%]; proportion of individuals without a high school degree in the area ≥29%, 6925 patients [13.2%] vs 22 648 patients [12.7%]). In addition, PSMs were documented more frequently at nonacademic institutions than academic ones (31 702 patients [60.5%] vs 20 714 patients [39.5%]). A total of 11 585 patients (5.0%) underwent aRT, and 7698 of them (3.3%) had a PSM at the final pathology examination. When controlling for patients' socioeconomic and demographic characteristics and tumor characteristics, men with PSMs were more likely than those with negative margins to undergo aRT, with an odds ratio of 3.79 (95% CI, 3.63-3.96; P < .001). The attributable risk fraction of the presence of a PSM on aRT was 44% (95% CI, 42%-45%). The attributable cost of a PSM was calculated as $17 356 (95% CI, $16 567-$17 751). Assuming 60 000 prostatectomies in 2019 and similar trends of PSM and aRT, the overall health burden attributable to PSMs was calculated to be $52 068 000 (95% CI, $49 701 000-$53 253 000).  Conclusions and relevance:   The estimated aRT cost attributable to the presence of a PSM was $17 356, resulting in $52 068 000 in spending on aRT in 2019. Strategies to reduce PSMs could be associated with a reduction in the overall health costs of surgically treated PCa.""","""['Alberto Martini', 'Kathryn E Marqueen', 'Ugo Giovanni Falagario', 'Nikhil Waingankar', 'Ethan Wajswol', 'Fahad Khan', 'Nicola Fossati', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Ashutosh K Tewari', 'Richard Stock', 'Ardeshir R Rastinehad']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Financial Impact of Positive Surgical Margins During Radical Prostatectomy and the Odds of Receiving Adjuvant Radiation Therapy.', 'Defining Clinically Meaningful Positive Surgical Margins in Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy for Localised Prostate Cancer.', 'Positive surgical margins: rate, contributing factors and impact on further treatment: findings from the Prostate Cancer Registry.', 'Significant reduction in positive surgical margin rate after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy by application of the modified surgical margin recommendations of the 2009 International Society of Urological Pathology consensus.', 'Radical prostatectomy: positive surgical margins matter.', 'Reporting positive surgical margins after radical prostatectomy: time for standardization.', 'Length of positive surgical margins after radical prostatectomy: Does size matter? - A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Validation of user-friendly models predicting extracapsular extension in prostate cancer patients.', 'Multiparametric MRI-based nomograms in predicting positive surgical margins of prostate cancer after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'A Matched-Pair Analysis after Robotic and Retropubic Radical Prostatectomy: A New Definition of Continence and the Impact of Different Surgical Techniques.', 'Racial Variation in Membranous Urethral Length and Postprostatectomy Urinary Function.']"""

Objective:   To characterize geographic variation in prostate cancer-specific mortality differences between black and white men.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cohort study included data from 17 geographic registries within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2014. Inclusion criteria were men 18 years and older with biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer. Men missing data on key variables (ie, cancer stage, Gleason grade group, prostate-specific antigen level, and survival follow-up data) were excluded. Analysis was performed from September 5 to December 25, 2018.  Exposure:   Patient SEER-designated race (ie, black, white, or other).  Main outcomes and measures:   Fine and Gray competing-risks regression analyses were used to evaluate the difference in prostate-cancer specific mortality between black and white men. A stratified analysis by Gleason grade group was performed stratified as grade group 1 and grade groups 2 through 5.  Results:   The final cohort consisted of 229 771 men, including 178 204 white men (77.6%), 35 006 black men (15.2%), and 16 561 men of other or unknown race (7.2%). Mean (SD) age at diagnosis was 64.9 (8.8) years. There were 4773 prostate cancer deaths among white men and 1250 prostate cancer deaths among black men. Compared with white men, black men had a higher risk of mortality overall (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 1.39 [95% CI, 1.30-1.48]). In the stratified analysis, there were 4 registries in which black men had worse prostate cancer-specific survival in both Gleason grade group 1 (Atlanta, Georgia: AHR, 5.49 [95% CI, 2.03-14.87]; Greater Georgia: AHR, 1.88 [95% CI, 1.10-3.22]; Louisiana: AHR, 1.80 [95% CI, 1.06-3.07]; New Jersey: AHR, 2.60 [95% CI, 1.53-4.40]) and Gleason grade groups 2 through 5 (Atlanta: AHR, 1.88 [95% CI, 1.46-2.45]; Greater Georgia: AHR, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.07-1.56]; Louisiana: AHR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.07-1.54]; New Jersey: AHR, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.24-1.87]), although the magnitude of survival difference was lower than for Gleason grade group 1 in each of these registries. The greatest race-based survival difference for men with Gleason grade group 1 disease was in the Atlanta registry.  Conclusions and relevance:   These findings suggest that population-level differences in prostate cancer survival among black and white men were associated with a small set of geographic areas and with low-risk prostate cancer.

A total of 159 patients with pathologic T3b PCa were stratified into two groups based on mpMRI findings (negative vs. positive SVI). A positive SVI was defined as the presence of mpMRI evidence of SVI. In addition, 290 patients with pathologic T3a were also included in this study for further comparative analysis. Fifty-two patients (32.7%) had a positive SVI on preoperative mpMRI. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) occurred in a total of 45 (28.3%) patients, with 25 (23.4%) cases in the negative SVI group and 20 (38.5%) cases in the positive SVI group. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of the two groups revealed significantly decreased BCR-free survival in the positive SVI group (median, 21 vs. 9 months, log-rank test, P < 0.001). On multivariate Cox regression analysis, pre-biopsy PSA (P = 0.035) and positive SVI on preoperative mpMRI (P = 0.049) were identified as significant predictors of BCR. Upon further comparative analysis with the pathologic T3a group, we also found significant differences among the groups throughout the Kaplan-Meier curve (P < 0.001). Conclusively, the unpredicted (negative) SVI group had a favorable BCR-free survival compared to the positive SVI group. In addition, significant differences were observed in the prognosis of pathologic T3a and these two groups.

The Decipher genomic classifier (GC) is a validated method to further risk-stratify disease in patients with prostate cancer, but its performance solely within National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) high-risk disease has not been undertaken to date.  Methods:   A multi-institutional retrospective study of 405 men with high-risk prostate cancer who underwent primary treatment with ﻿radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy (RT) with androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) at 11 centers from 1995 to 2005 was performed. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the hazard ratios (HR) for the development of metastatic disease based on clinico-pathologic variables, risk groups, and GC score. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was determined for regression models without and with the GC score.  Results:   Over a median follow-up of 82 months, 104 patients (26%) developed metastatic disease. On univariable analysis, increasing GC score was significantly associated with metastatic disease ([HR]: 1.34 per 0.1 unit increase, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19-1.50, p < 0.001), while age, serum PSA, biopsy GG, and clinical T-stage were not (all p > 0.05). On multivariable analysis, GC score (HR: 1.33 per 0.1 unit increase, 95% CI: 1.19-1.48, p < 0.001) and GC high-risk (vs low-risk, HR: 2.95, 95% CI: 1.79-4.87, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with metastasis. The addition of GC score to regression models based on NCCN risk group improved model AUC from 0.46 to 0.67, and CAPRA from 0.59 to 0.71.  Conclusions:   Among men with high-risk prostate cancer, conventional clinico-pathologic data had poor discrimination to risk stratify development of metastatic disease.

Our previous study showed that dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor Dactolisib impaired the viability and immunosuppressive function of Gr-MDSCs, and significantly synergized with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) antibodies targeting PD1 and CTLA4 to eradicate metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in a preclinical transgenic mouse model. On the contrary, tyrosine kinase inhibitor Dasatinib diminished tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes and showed no synergic activity with ICB. The understanding of the distinct effects of Dactolisib and Dasatinib on Gr-MDSCs, T cells and prostate neoplastic cells is inadequate, limiting the clinical translation of the combination immunotherapy. To address this question, we applied Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) to profile 297 proteins and protein phosphorylation sites of Gr-MDSCs, T cells and prostate cancer cells isolated from the CRPC model. We found cell type-specific protein expression patterns and highly selective targets by the two drugs, including preferential inhibition of phospho-4E-BP1 in Gr-MDSCs by Dactolisib and preferential suppression of phospho-Src and phospho-p38 MAPK in T cells. Furthermore, transcriptomic profiling of Gr-MDSCs treated with the two inhibitors revealed downregulation of mitochondrial respiration pathways by Dactolisib but not Dasatinib.

Methods:   The 9255 men diagnosed with PCa in the Finnish Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer were included. Cancer stage, comorbidity, education level and primary treatment modality were extracted from the patient records, the Finnish Cancer Registry, Statistics Finland and the National Institute of Health and Welfare, and these covariates were used in logistic regression (treatment selection) and Cox regression (survival analysis).  Results:   In high-risk cancers, men with tertiary education were more likely to be treated with radical prostatectomy (odds ratio [OR] = 1.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.27-2.44) than men with primary education. Men with secondary (OR = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.38-0.84) or tertiary (OR = 0.42; 95% CI = 0.29-0.60) education were managed less frequently with mere hormonal therapy. In locally advanced cases, tertiary education was associated with more curatively aimed therapies and less hormonal therapy (OR for radical prostatectomy = 2.34; 95% CI = 1.49-3.66; OR for radiotherapy = 1.42; 95% CI = 1.09-1.85; OR for hormonal therapy = 0.45; 95% CI = 0.33-0.60).

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and powder X-rays diffraction (pXRD) studies depicted the compatibility of SFN with all the structural components. In addition, the colloidal stability, in vitro cytotoxicity and cell growth inhibition studies of LPHNPs also demonstrated stability in biological media, biocompatibility and safety with enhanced anti-proliferative effects than the free SFN in breast cancer and prostate cancer cells.

Materials and methods:   Data on 760 men who participated in the RTOG 9601 trial were extracted using the NCTN data archive platform. Patients were stratified into biochemical recurrence (nadir-PSA ≤0.4 ng/ml) or persistence (nadir-PSA >0.4 ng/ml) groups, based on the cut-off reported in the original trial. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) methodology was utilized to minimize the baseline differences among groups. Competing-risk and Kaplan-Meier analyses estimated the impact of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) persistence vs. recurrence on local and metastatic disease progression and overall-mortality in the IPTW-adjusted model; a 2-sided P < 0.05 was considered significant.  Results:   All patients received sRT, and about 50% of the patients in either group received concomitant antiandrogen therapy (P = 0.951). The median follow-up was 12 years. After IPTW, the 2 groups were well-matched with standardized mean differences ∼10%. In the IPTW-adjusted cohort, the 10-year local and metastatic disease occurrence rates were 3.2% vs. 1.4% (Gray's P = 0.0001) and 28.6% vs. 10.1% (Gray's P < 0.0001) in patients with persistent vs. recurrent PSA, respectively. Similarly, the 10-year overall-mortality rates were 24.9% vs. 11.9% (Log-rank P = 0.029), respectively.  Conclusions:   Patients with biochemical persistence after RP are approximately 2.5 times more likely to experience local/metastatic failure and death, compared to patients with biochemical recurrence after RP, despite equivalent sRT with/without antiandrogen therapy use.

New ways to stratify patients are urgently needed. We conducted a feasibility study of such novel assessments, looking for associations between genomic changes and lymphocyte infiltration. An innovative workflow using an in-house targeted sequencing panel, immune cell profiling using an image analysis pipeline, RNA sequencing, and exome sequencing in select cases was tested. Gene fusions were profiled by RNA sequencing in 27 of 27 cases, and a significantly higher tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) count was noted in tumors without a TMPRSS2:ERG fusion compared with those with the fusion (P = 0.01). Although this finding was not replicated in a larger validation set (n = 436) of The Cancer Genome Atlas images, there was a trend in the same direction. Differential expression analysis of TIL-high and TIL-low tumors revealed the enrichment of both innate and adaptive immune response pathways. Mutations in mismatch repair genes (MLH1 and MSH6 mutations in 1 of 27 cases) were identified. We describe a potential immune escape mechanism in TMPRSS2:ERG fusion-positive tumors.

Aim:   To characterize rates and timing of penile prosthesis implantation after RP and to identify predictors of implantation using a more representative data set.  Methods:   The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient and State Ambulatory Surgery databases for Florida from 2006 to 2015 were used. Patients undergoing RP (2006-2012) were tracked longitudinally for penile prosthesis implantation. Patient and clinical data were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression.  Outcomes:   The primary outcome was risk-adjusted predictors of prosthesis implantation, and the secondary outcome was predictors of the highest quartile of time between RP and penile prosthesis.  Results:   Of 29,288 men who had RP, 1,449 (4.9%) patients underwent subsequent prosthesis. The mean time from RP to prosthesis was 2.6 years (median: 2.1; interquartile range [IQR]: 1.2-3.5). Adjusted predictors of prosthesis implantation included open RP (odds ratio [OR]: 1.5, P < .01), African American race (OR: 1.7, P < .01) or Hispanic ethnicity (OR: 3.2, P < .01), and Medicare (OR: 1.4, P < .01) insurance. Oler patients (age >70 years; OR: 0.7, P < .01) and those from the highest income quartile relative to the lowest (OR: 0.8, P < .05) were less likely to be implanted. Adjusted predictors of longer RP-to-implantation time (highest quartile: median: 4.7 years; IQR: 3.9-6.0 years) included open RP (OR: 1.78, P < .01), laparoscopic RP (OR: 4.67, P < .01), Medicaid (OR: 3.03, P < .05), private insurance (OR: 2.57, P < .01), and being in the highest income quartile (OR: 2.52, P < .01).  Clinical implications:   These findings suggest ED treatment healthcare disparities meriting further investigation; upfront counseling on all ED treatment modalities and close monitoring for conservative treatment failure may reduce lost quality of life years.  Strengths & limitations:   This study is limited by its use of administrative data, which relies on accurate coding and lacks data on ED questionnaires/prior treatments, patient-level cost, and oncologic outcomes. Quartile-based analysis of income and time between RP and prosthesis limits the conclusions that can be drawn.  Conclusion:   Less than 5% of post-RP patients undergo penile prosthesis implantation, with open RP, Medicare, African American race, and Hispanic ethnicity predicting post-RP implantation; living in the wealthiest residential areas predicts lower likelihood of implantation compared to the least wealthy areas. Patients with the longest time between RP and prosthesis are more likely to live in the wealthiest areas or have undergone open/laparoscopic RP relative to robotic RP.

Before the procedure, blood samples were collected to test prostate specific antigen (PSA) and free/total PSA ratio (%fPSA) and PHI was calculated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the benefit of these values for predicting the presence of PCa.  Results:   Based on histological examination 31 males were diagnosed with PCa, the remaining 24 were negative.

Three BNR techniques-zero o'clock reconstruction (ZOR), six o'clock reconstruction (SOR), and three/nine o'clock reconstruction (T/NOR)-applied in patients with large bladder opening after prostate resection are described comprehensively. Demographic and perioperative data were collected and analyzed using Pearson's chi-square and one-way analysis of variance test. Multivariate analysis was performed to explore predictors that affected continence recovery in 24 hours, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after catheter removal. Results: Laparoscopic RP was performed in all patients, wherein 37, 35, 34, and 15 patients underwent bladder neck preservation, ZOR, SOR, and T/NOR techniques, respectively. There were more high-risk patients and larger mean prostate volume in groups with BNR techniques. Perioperatively, patients with reconstruction techniques had longer operation and anastomosis time, more estimated blood loss, and more positive margin status. Nevertheless, there was no significant difference among four groups regarding continence recovery in 24 hours, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after catheter removal. On multivariable analysis, positive apical margin and long anastomosis time were independent adverse predictors of continence recovery in 24 hours. Large prostate volume and positive apical margin were adverse factors of continence recovery at 1, 3, and 6 months.

Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) is an oncogene that stimulates mRNA translation via binding to the 5' endcap structure. It is well documented that eIF4E is overexpressed in many cancers including breast, prostate, head and neck, and stomach malignancies and leads to oncogenic transformation and metastasis. One approach to block eIF4E function in cancer cells is based on the disruption of the interaction between eIF4E and the 5' mRNA cap structure using cap analog inhibitors. Since analogs are cell-impermeable due to their anionic nature, we used a cell penetrating peptide (CPP) for delivery of model cap analogs into cancer cells. The human immunodeficiency virus I (HIV-1) transactivator of transcription derived peptide (TAT) was conjugated with the analogs m7GMP and m7GpppG using click chemistry methodology. We observed that both conjugates (m7GMP-TAT and m7GpppG-TAT), contrary to TAT alone, did not translocate through the artificial phospholipid membrane of giant unilamellar vesicles. This suggests that passive transport is not the mechanism by which translocation of cap analogs occurs. In contrast, synthesized fluorescently labeled m7GpppG-TAT translocated into the human breast adenocarcinoma cancer cell line MCF-7. Furthermore, we demonstrated that m7GMP-TAT and m7GpppG-TAT inhibited cap-dependent translation up to 30% both in vivo and in vitro while simultaneously not affecting cell growth and viability. These results demonstrate the usefulness of cell penetration peptides as carriers for the internalization of cap analogs.""","""['Karolina Piecyk', 'Paulina Pietrow', 'Thomas Arnold', 'Remigiusz Worch', 'Nadejda L Korneeva', 'Marzena Jankowska-Anyszka']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Bioconjug Chem""","""['High affinity RNA for mammalian initiation factor 4E interferes with mRNA-cap binding and inhibits translation.', ""Biophysical studies of eIF4E cap-binding protein: recognition of mRNA 5' cap structure and synthetic fragments of eIF4G and 4E-BP1 proteins."", ""Inhibition of Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase (MAPK)-interacting Kinase (MNK) Preferentially Affects Translation of mRNAs Containing Both a 5'-Terminal Cap and Hairpin."", 'eIF4E activity is regulated at multiple levels.', 'Regulation of cap-dependent translation by eIF4E inhibitory proteins.', 'N2 modified dinucleotide cap analogs as a potent tool for mRNA engineering.', 'Recent Advances in Modified Cap Analogs: Synthesis, Biochemical Properties, and mRNA Based Vaccines.', 'A cell-penetrant lactam-stapled peptide for targeting eIF4E protein-protein interactions.']"""

The effect estimates for the hazard ratio (HR) or risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were collected and pooled with a random- or fixed-effect model.  Results:   In total, 18 eligible studies were retrieved with 5468 participants from nine countries. The overall pooled effect size for HR and RR was 1.50 and 3.79, respectively, which was proved to be statistically significant. In the subgroup of prostate cancer (PCa) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), statistical significance and marginal statistical significance was presented for the pooled HR (HR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.35-2.29) and (RR = 1.56, 95% CI 0.99-2.48), respectively. However, in the subgroup of thyroid cancer, breast cancer, and renal cancer, statistical significance was not achieved (HR = 1.17, 95% CI 0.75-1.83, Z = 0.70, P = 0.486). The results did not show any evidence of publication bias.  Conclusions:   This study demonstrated that visceral metastasis was a significant prognostic factor in patients with spinal metastases as a whole. Interestingly, the onset of visceral metastases differentially impacted the survival in different primary tumors. Therefore, the prognostic value of visceral metastasis might be related to the type of primary tumor.""","""['Deng-Xing Lun', 'Nai-Wang Chen', 'Jiang-Tao Feng', 'Xion-Gang Yang', 'Zhao-Wan Xu', 'Feng Li', 'Yong-Cheng Hu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Orthop Surg""","""['Prognostic factors for overall survival in patients with spinal metastasis secondary to prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Is Ambulatory Status a Prognostic Factor of Survival in Patients with Spinal Metastases?

A promising approach to improve in-situ detection of PCa lies in using the optical properties of the tissue to discern cancer from healthy tissue. In this work, we present the first in-situ image-guided navigation system for a spatially tracked Raman spectroscopy probe integrated in a PCa workflow, capturing the optical tissue fingerprint. The probe is guided with fused TRUS/MR imaging and tested with both tissue-simulating phantoms and ex-vivo prostates. The workflow was designed to be integrated the clinical workflow for trans-perineal prostate biopsies, as well as for high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy.  Methods:   The proposed system developed in 3D Slicer includes an electromagnetically tracked Raman spectroscopy probe, along with tracked TRUS imaging automatically registered to diagnostic MRI. The proposed system is tested on both custom gelatin tissue-simulating optical phantoms and biological tissue phantoms. A random-forest classifier was then trained on optical spectrums from ex-vivo prostates following prostatectomy using our optical probe. Preliminary in-human results are presented with the Raman spectroscopy instrument to detect malignant tissue in-situ with histopathology confirmation.  Results:   In 5 synthetic gelatin and biological tissue phantoms, we demonstrate the ability of the image-guided Raman system by detecting over 95% of lesions, based on biopsy samples. The included lesion volumes ranged from 0.1 to 0.61 cc. We showed the compatibility of our workflow with the current HDR brachytherapy setup. In ex-vivo prostates of PCa patients, the system showed a 81% detection accuracy in high grade lesions.  Conclusion:   Pre-clinical experiments demonstrated promising results for in-situ confirmation of lesion locations in prostates using Raman spectroscopy, both in phantoms and human ex-vivo prostate tissue, which is required for integration in HDR brachytherapy procedures.""","""['Roozbeh Shams', 'Fabien Picot', 'David Grajales', 'Guillaume Sheehy', 'Frederick Dallaire', 'Mirela Birlea', 'Fred Saad', 'Dominique Trudel', 'Cynthia Menard', 'Frederic Leblond', 'Samuel Kadoury']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg""","""['Image-guided Raman spectroscopy navigation system to improve transperineal prostate cancer detection.

Residual intraprostatic androgens can be produced by de novo synthesis of androgens from cholesterol or conversion from adrenal androgens by steroidogenic enzymes expressed in prostate cancer cells via different steroidogenic pathways. However, the dysregulation of androgen biosynthetic enzymes in CRPC still remains poorly understood. This study aims to elucidate the role of the nuclear receptor, estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα, ESRRA), in the promotion of androgen biosynthesis in CRPC growth. Methods: ERRα expression in CRPC patients was analyzed using Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets and validated in established CRPC xenograft model. The roles of ERRα in the promotion of castration-resistant growth were elucidated by overexpression and knockdown studies and the intratumoral androgen levels were measured by UPLC-MS/MS. The effect of suppression of ERRα activity in the potentiation of sensitivity to androgen-deprivation was determined using an ERRα inverse agonist. Results: ERRα exhibited an increased expression in metastatic CRPC and CRPC xenograft model, could act to promote castration-resistant growth via direct transactivation of two key androgen synthesis enzymes CYP11A1 and AKR1C3, and hence enhance intraprostatic production of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and activation of AR signaling in prostate cancer cells. Notably, inhibition of ERRα activity by an inverse agonist XCT790 could reduce the DHT production and suppress AR signaling in prostate cancer cells. Conclusion: Our study reveals a new role of ERRα in the intratumoral androgen biosynthesis in CRPC via its transcriptional control of steroidogenic enzymes, and also provides a novel insight that targeting ERRα could be a potential androgen-deprivation strategy for the management of CRPC.""","""['Zhenyu Xu', 'Taiyang Ma', 'Jianfu Zhou', 'Weijie Gao', 'Youjia Li', 'Shan Yu', 'Yuliang Wang', 'Franky Leung Chan']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Nuclear Receptor LRH-1 Functions to Promote Castration-Resistant Growth of Prostate Cancer via Its Promotion of Intratumoral Androgen Biosynthesis.', 'Orphan nuclear receptors as regulators of intratumoral androgen biosynthesis in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'AKR1C3 Inhibitor KV-37 Exhibits Antineoplastic Effects and Potentiates Enzalutamide in Combination Therapy in Prostate Adenocarcinoma Cells.', 'Contribution of Adrenal Glands to Intratumor Androgens and Growth of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor functions in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance to new agents targeting the androgen axis.', 'PI(4,5)P2 and Cholesterol: Synthesis, Regulation, and Functions.', 'Advances in the Current Understanding of the Mechanisms Governing the Acquisition of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'A Novel Overall Survival Prediction Signature Based on Comprehensive Research in Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases.', 'Gemcitabine and XCT790, an ERRα inverse agonist, display a synergistic anticancer effect in pancreatic cancer.', 'Estrogen-related receptor alpha in select host functions and cancer: new frontiers.']"""

We identify and compare expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and CpG methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs) among 147 established PrCa risk SNPs in primary prostate tumors (n = 355 from a Seattle-based study and n = 495 from The Cancer Genome Atlas, TCGA) and tumor-adjacent, histologically benign samples (n = 471 from a Mayo Clinic study). The role of DNA methylation in eQTL regulation of gene expression was investigated by data triangulation using several causal inference approaches, including a proposed adaptation of the Causal Inference Test (CIT) for causal direction. Comparing eQTLs between tumors and benign samples, we show that 98 of the 147 risk SNPs were identified as eQTLs in the tumor-adjacent benign samples, and almost all 34 eQTL identified in tumor sets were also eQTLs in the benign samples. Three lines of results support the causal role of DNA methylation. First, nearly 100 of the 147 risk SNPs were identified as meQTLs in one tumor set, and almost all eQTLs in tumors were meQTLs. Second, the loss of eQTLs in tumors relative to benign samples was associated with altered DNA methylation. Third, among risk SNPs identified as both eQTLs and meQTLs, mediation analyses suggest that over two-thirds have evidence of a causal role for DNA methylation, mostly mediating genetic influence on gene expression. In summary, we provide a comprehensive catalog of eQTLs, meQTLs and putative cancer genes for known PrCa risk SNPs. We observe that a substantial portion of germline eQTL regulatory mechanisms are maintained in the tumor development, despite somatic alterations in tumor genome.

The phenotypes of intravenously transplanted fluorescent cells were monitored by high-resolution, single-cell intravital confocal and light-sheet imaging. Engrafted osteotropic, androgen independent PCa cells were extravasated from caudle vein, invaded the neighboring tissue, proliferated and formed experimental metastases around caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) in four days. Gene expression comparison between cells in culture and in CHT revealed that engrafted PCa cells responded to the ZF microenvironment by elevating expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness markers. Next, metastatic potentials of ALDHhi cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) and ALDHlow non-CSCs were analyzed in ZF. Engraftment of CSCs induced faster metastatic onset, however after six days both cell subpopulations equally responded to the ZF microenvironment, resulting in the same increase of stemness genes expression including Nanog, Oct-4 and Cripto. Knockdown of Cripto significantly reduced the vimentin/E-cadherin ratio in engrafted cells, indicating that Cripto is required for transduction of the microenvironment signals from the ZF niche to increase mesenchymal potential of cells. Targeting of either Cripto or EMT transcriptional factors Snail 1 and Zeb1 significantly suppressed metastatic growth. These data indicated that zebrafish microenvironment governed the CSC/EMT plasticity of human PCa cells promoting metastasis initiation.""","""['Lanpeng Chen', 'Maciej Boleslaw Olszewski', 'Marianna Kruithof-de Julio', 'B Ewa Snaar-Jagalska']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cells""","""['LGR5 Is a Gastric Cancer Stem Cell Marker Associated with Stemness and the EMT Signature Genes NANOG, NANOGP8, PRRX1, TWIST1, and BMI1.', 'DNMT1 Regulates Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition and Cancer Stem Cells, Which Promotes Prostate Cancer Metastasis.', 'SNAIL induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cell-like properties in aldehyde dehydroghenase-negative thyroid cancer cells.', 'Epithelial, mesenchymal and hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal phenotypes and their clinical relevance in cancer metastasis.', 'Induction of metastasis, cancer stem cell phenotype, and oncogenic metabolism in cancer cells by ionizing radiation.', 'Zebrafish Patient-Derived Xenograft Model as a Preclinical Platform for Uveal Melanoma Drug Discovery.', 'Photosubstitution in a trisheteroleptic ruthenium complex inhibits conjunctival melanoma growth in a zebrafish orthotopic xenograft model.', 'Quantifying the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) from Bench to Bedside.', ""Whence CRIPTO: The Reemergence of an Oncofetal Factor in 'Wounds' That Fail to Heal."", 'The Multifaceted Role of Aldehyde Dehydrogenases in Prostate Cancer Stem Cells.']"""

An assessment of changing loss of life expectancy for people with cancer in Western Australia from 1982 to 2016""","""Background:   Cancer survival has improved in Western Australia (WA) over recent decades. Loss of life expectancy (LOLE) is a useful measure for assessing cancer survival at a population-level. Some previous studies estimating LOLE have required a minimum follow-up beyond diagnosis to reduce the impact of modelled extrapolation, while others have not. The first aim of this study was to assess the impact of minimum length of follow-up on LOLE estimates for people diagnosed in 2006 with female breast, colorectal, prostate, lung, cervical, combined oesophageal and stomach cancers, and melanoma. Based on these results, the second aim was to assess temporal changes in LOLE for these cancer types for diagnoses between 1982 and 2016.  Methods:   Person-level linked cancer registry and mortality data were used for invasive primary cancer diagnoses for WA residents aged 15-89 years. The analysis for aim one included cases diagnosed from 1982 to the end of 2006, followed to the end of 2006 (i.e. no minimum follow-up), 2011 (i.e. five years minimum follow-up, assuming survival) or 2016 (i.e. 10 years minimum follow-up). To achieve the second study aim, the diagnostic period was extended to the end of 2016. Life expectancy estimates were obtained after fitting flexible parametric relative survival models. Single-year age and sex-specific death rates were used as a reference to estimate LOLE and proportionate loss of life expectancy.  Results:   Temporal changes were not reported for prostate, cervical, oesophageal and stomach cancers or melanoma, due to differences in LOLE estimates by minimum follow-up time, or estimate imprecision. Marked reductions in LOLE were observed for female breast and colorectal cancer. There was minimal absolute reduction for lung cancer, where LOLE remained high.  Conclusion:   This study considered the appropriateness of including recent cancer diagnoses when assessing temporal changes in LOLE, finding variation in estimates with differing minimum follow-up or high parameter uncertainty for most included cancer types. Temporal changes in LOLE in-turn reflected changes in the life expectancy of the general population, cancer detection and management. These factors must be considered when estimating and interpreting LOLE estimates.""","""['Cameron M Wright', 'Rachael E Moorin']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol""","""['Temporal changes in loss of life expectancy due to cancer in Australia: a flexible parametric approach.', 'Temporal trends in loss of life expectancy after a cancer diagnosis among the Australian population.', 'Estimating the change in life expectancy after a diagnosis of cancer among the Australian population.', 'Projecting the impact of AIDS on mortality.', 'Sutureless Aortic Valve Replacement for Treatment of Severe Aortic Stenosis: A Single Technology Assessment of Perceval Sutureless Aortic Valve Internet.']"""

However, when used on heterogeneous samples, it cannot identify individual cell types harbouring miRNAs. For this, in situ hybridisation (ISH) can be used. ISH methods using locked nucleic acid (LNA) probes give reliable results in formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. In this study their use has been directly compared with conventional oligonucleotide probes (COP) for ISH.  Methods:   FFPE samples of colorectal adenocarcinoma, squamous carcinoma of lung and cases of invasive breast carcinoma were used to evaluate COP and LNA methods for the demonstration of miR-126 and miR-205. To demonstrate the utility of the COP method demonstration of miR-21 in 19 Gleason stage 7 prostate biopsy FFPE tissues was also undertaken. The demonstration of miR-21 by ISH in high and low expressing prostate cancer cell lines was also compared with qRT-PCR.  Results:   Similar results were obtained using the COP and LNA ISH methods for the demonstration of miR-126 and miR-205. miR-21 was successfully demonstrated in the prostate cancer samples by COP ISH and expression levels of the miRNA demonstrated in the cell lines corresponded with qRT-PCR.

PI-RADS was predicted by baseline severity, age, sleep problems, expectations, maternal depression, and the action stage of change. It moderated outcomes such that there were treatment differences for less placebo-responsive patients. For participants prone to placebo response, type of treatment had no statistically significant impact on outcomes. Baseline depression severity accounted for this effect: treatment differences were small and non-significant for patients with milder depression but larger in more severely depressed patients.

Although both enantiomers of this compound have sub-micromolar IC50 values and bind to the enzyme with a type II spectral change (indicative of nitrogen-iron bonding) and reported Kd values of 56 and 40 nM (R and S, respectively), the rates of binding to P450 17A1 were relatively slow. We considered the possibility that the drug is a slow, tight-binding inhibitor. Analysis of the kinetics of binding revealed rapid formation of an initial complex, presumably in the substrate binding site, followed by a slower change to the spectrum of a final iron complex. Similar kinetics were observed in the interaction of another inhibitor, the triazole (S)-seviteronel (VT-464), with P450 17A1.

Once recurrence is suspected, other positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers could be of interest to discriminate between local and distant relapse. We studied [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) targeting glucose metabolism, [18F]fluorocholine ([18F]FCH) targeting membrane metabolism and peptide-based imaging agents [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11, [68Ga]Ga-AMBA, [68Ga]Ga-NODAGA-RGD and [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-NT-20.3 targeting PSMA, gastrin releasing peptide receptor (GRPr), αvβ3 integrin and neurotensin type 1 receptor (NTSR1) respectively, in different PCa tumour models.  Methods:   Mice were xenografted with 22Rv1, an androgen-receptor (AR)-positive, PCa cell line that expresses PSMA and PC3, an AR-negative one that does not express PSMA. PET imaging using the different radiotracers was performed sequentially and the uptake characteristics compared to one other. NTSR1 and PSMA expression levels were analysed in tumours by immunohistochemistry.  Results:   [18F]FDG displayed low but sufficient uptake to visualize PC3 and 22Rv1 derived tumours. We also observed a low efficacy of [18F]FCH PET imaging and a low [68Ga]Ga-NODAGA-RGD tumour uptake in those tumours. As expected, an elevated tumour uptake was obtained for [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 in 22Rv1 derived tumour although no uptake was measured in the androgen independent cell line PC3, derived from a bone metastasis of a high-grade PCa. Moreover, in PC3 cell line, we obtained good tumour uptake, high tumour-to-background contrast using [68Ga]Ga-AMBA and [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-NT-20.3. Immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed high NTSR1 expression in PC3 derived tumours and conversely high PSMA expression in 22Rv1 derived tumours.  Conclusion:   PET imaging using [68Ga]Ga-AMBA and [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-NT-20.3 demonstrates that GRPr and NTSR1 could represent viable alternative targets for diagnostic or therapeutic applications in PCa with limited PSMA expression levels. More preclinical and clinical studies will follow to explore this potential.  Advances in knowledge and implications for patient:   Peptide-based imaging agents targeting PSMA represent a major progress in the evaluation of biochemical recurrence of PCa but sometimes yield false negative results in some lesions. Continuing efforts have thus been made to evaluate other radiotracers.

Materials and methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry (2001-2016) we identified variant histology and clear cell renal cell carcinoma cases. Cumulative incidence plots, multivariate Cox regression models matched for stage, grade and other patient characteristics addressed cancer specific mortality. Subgroup analyses relied on inverse probability treatment weighting according to nephrectomy type.  Results:   Of all 69,785 patients with renal cell carcinoma 2,495 harbored variant histology (3.6%). Of patients with variant histology 70.1% (1,748) harbored sarcomatoid vs 11.2% (280) collecting duct vs 7.6% (190) mesenchymal vs 3.8% (94) neuroendocrine vs 2.9% (72) renal medullary vs 2.5% (62) mucinous tubular and spindle cell, and 2.0% (49) rhabdoid tumors. All patients with variant histology exhibited more advanced TNM stage at diagnosis than clear cell renal cell carcinoma, except for mucinous tubular and spindle cell. After matching with G4 clear cell renal cell carcinoma, collecting duct (multivariate HR 1.6, p <0.01), sarcomatoid (HR 1.8, p <0.01), renal medullary (HR 1.7, p=0.1) and rhabdoid variant histology (HR 1.5, p=0.1) showed higher cancer specific mortality than clear cell renal cell carcinoma. No cancer specific mortality differences were recorded for mesenchymal, neuroendocrine and mucinous tubular and spindle cell variant histology. In nephrectomy subgroup higher cancer specific mortality was recorded after partial nephrectomy than radical nephrectomy in sarcomatoid variant histology after inverse probability treatment weighting and multivariate adjustment (HR 1.2, p=0.02).  Conclusions:   TNM stage at diagnosis is universally more advanced in patients with variant histology, except for mucinous tubular and spindle cell. Cancer specific mortality is higher in collecting duct, sarcomatoid, rhabdoid and renal medullary variant histology, but not in other variant histology. Partial nephrectomy is associated with worse survival in sarcomatoid variant histology but could not be assessed in other variant histology due to small sample size.""","""['Marina Deuker', 'Franziska Stolzenbach', 'Giuseppe Rosiello', 'Carlotta Palumbo', 'Thomas Martin', 'Zhe Tian', 'Felix K-H Chun', 'Fred Saad', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Anil Kapoor', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Editorial Comment.', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma: Comparison between Variant Histology and Clear Cell Carcinoma across All Stages and Treatment Modalities.

We examined the association of Gleason sum, serum prostate specific antigen and prostate specific antigen doubling time with any detectable and pelvic confined disease in patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Data from 108 patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy who underwent prostate specific membrane antigen targeted 18F-DCFPyL positron emission tomography/computerized tomography were analyzed. Data were collected on positive positron emission tomography findings as well as pelvic confined disease. Associations between Gleason sum, prostate specific antigen and prostate specific antigen doubling time were retrospectively explored.  Results:   Serum prostate specific antigen was associated with positive prostate specific membrane antigen targeted imaging as continuous (OR 3.08, 95% CI 1.60-7.95, p=0.005) and categorical values (ie prostate specific antigen greater than 2.0 to 5.0 vs 0.5 ng/ml or less, OR 16.92, 95% CI 3.13-315.81, p=0.008). No relationship between Gleason sum or prostate specific antigen doubling time with overall positive imaging was observed. Patients with a prostate specific antigen greater than 2.0 to 5.0 ng/ml were significantly less likely to be diagnosed with pelvic confined disease compared with the 0.5 ng/ml or less subgroup (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06-0.69, p=0.013).

Methods:   Men in the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer between 1992 and 2013 were followed for mortality through December 2016. Current weight was self-reported on follow-up questionnaires approximately every 2 years. Postdiagnosis BMI was obtained from the first survey completed 1 to < 6 years after diagnosis. Weight change was the difference in weight between the first and second postdiagnosis surveys. Deaths occurring within 4 years of the follow-up were excluded to reduce bias from reverse causation. Analyses of BMI and weight change included 8,330 and 6,942 participants, respectively.  Results:   Postdiagnosis BMI analyses included 3,855 deaths from all causes (PCSM, n = 500; CVDM, n = 1,155). Using Cox proportional hazards models, hazard ratios (HRs) associated with postdiagnosis obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) compared with healthy weight (BMI 18.5 to < 25.0 kg/m2) were 1.28 for PCSM (95% CI, 0.96 to 1.67), 1.24 for CVDM (95% CI, 1.03 to 1.49), and 1.23 for all-cause mortality (95% CI, 1.11 to 1.35). Weight gain analyses included 2,973 deaths (PCSM, n = 375; CVDM, n = 881). Postdiagnosis weight gain (> 5% of body weight), compared with stable weight (± < 3%), was associated with a higher risk of PCSM (HR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.21 to 2.25) and all-cause mortality (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.45) but not CVDM.  Conclusion:   Results suggest that among survivors of nonmetastatic prostate cancer with largely localized disease, postdiagnosis obesity is associated with higher CVDM and all-cause mortality, and possibly higher PCSM, and that postdiagnosis weight gain may be associated with a higher mortality as a result of all causes and prostate cancer.""","""['Alyssa N Troeschel', 'Terryl J Hartman', 'Eric J Jacobs', 'Victoria L Stevens', 'Ted Gansler', 'W Dana Flanders', 'Lauren E McCullough', 'Ying Wang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Mounting Weight of Evidence on the Importance of Body Weight for Men With Prostate Cancer.', 'Lycopene, tomato products and prostate cancer-specific mortality among men diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer in the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort.', 'The risk of prostate cancer mortality and cardiovascular mortality of nonmetastatic prostate cancer patients: A population-based retrospective cohort study.', 'Recreational Physical Activity in Relation to Prostate Cancer-specific Mortality Among Men with Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Body mass index and mortality in prostate cancer patients: a dose-response meta-analysis.', 'Body mass index, prostate cancer-specific mortality, and biochemical recurrence: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Dental Pain in Care Homes: Is It a Phenomenon?

Identification of clinically relevant genetic alterations leading to CRPC may reveal potential vulnerabilities for cancer therapy. Here we find that CUB domain-containing protein 1 (CDCP1), a transmembrane protein that acts as a substrate for SRC family kinases (SFKs), is overexpressed in a subset of CRPC. Notably, CDCP1 cooperates with the loss of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN to promote the emergence of metastatic prostate cancer. Mechanistically, we find that androgens suppress CDCP1 expression and that androgen deprivation in combination with loss of PTEN promotes the upregulation of CDCP1 and the subsequent activation of the SRC/MAPK pathway. Moreover, we demonstrate that anti-CDCP1 immunoliposomes (anti-CDCP1 ILs) loaded with chemotherapy suppress prostate cancer growth when administered in combination with enzalutamide.

Here, a strategy for specific determination of AMACR in real human serum by using an electrochemical microsensor system is presented. In order to implement the protocol, a self-organized nanohybrid consisting of metal nanopillars in a 2D MoS2 matrix is developed as material for the sensing interface. The testing signal outputs are strongly enhanced with the presence of the nanohybrids owing to that the metal pillars provide an efficient mass difussion and electron transfer path to the MoS2 film surface. Furthermore, the phase-regulated sensing mechanism over MoS2 is noticed and demonstrated by density functional theory calculation and experiments. The explored MoS2 based nanohybrids are employed for the fabrication of an electrochemical microsensor, presenting good linear relationship in both ng µL-1 and pg µL-1 ranges for AMACR quantification. The sampling analysis of human serum indicates that this microsensor has good diagnostic specificity and sensitivity toward AMACR. The proposed electrochemical microsensor system also demonstrates the advantages of convenience, cost-effectiveness, and disposability, resulting in a potential integrated microsystem for point-of-care prostate cancer diagnosis.""","""['Zi Ying', 'Lingyan Feng', 'Dongqing Ji', 'Yuan Zhang', 'Wei Chen', 'Yifan Dai', 'Metini Janyasupab', 'Xinxin Li', 'Weijia Wen', 'Chung-Chiun Liu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Small""","""['Application of alpha-methylacyl coenzyme A racemase immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis of prostate cancer: a review.', 'Is there a role for prostate tumour overexpressed-1 in the diagnosis of HGPIN and of prostatic adenocarcinoma?

SOH implant is not equally effective in all patients. Determining patients in which the implant will offer most benefit, in terms of rectal dose reduction, allows for effective management of SOH resources. Several factors have been shown to be correlated with reduction in rectal dose including distance between rectum and planning treatment volume (PTV), volume of rectum in the PTV, and change in rectum volume pre- to post-SOH. Several of these factors along with other pre-SOH CT metrics were able to predict reduction in rectal dose associated with SOH implant. Rectal V55Gy metric, was selected as the dose level of interest in the context of 60 Gy in 20 fraction treatment plans. Models were produced to predict change in RV55Gy and pre-SOH hydrogel RV55Gy. These models offered R-squared between 0.81 and 0.88 with statistical significance in each model. Applying an ω 1 = 3% lower limit of pre-SOH RV55 Gy and an ω 2 = 3.5% lower limit on change in RV55 Gy, retained 60% of patients experiencing the largest rectal dose reduction from the hydrogel.

Methods:   Retrospective analysis of consecutive patients with genitourinary cancers undergoing CT during an ER visit at a tertiary cancer center during a 20-month period. CTs were considered positive if there were findings relevant to the presenting complaint(s). Demographic/clinical variables were recorded. OS was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression (HR) was used to evaluate OS predictors.  Results:   Two hundred twenty-seven patients (243 visits) were included. The most common primary tumors were prostate (121 [49.8%]), bladder/urothelial (78 [32.1%]), and renal (69 [28.4%]). Common presenting complaints were abdominal pain (67 [27.6%]), respiratory symptoms (49 [20.2%]), neurological signs (37 [15.2%]), and fever (34 [14.0%]). CT findings were positive in 172 patients (70.8%) and included new/increased metastases (21.4% [52/243]), fluid collections (7.4% [18/243]), urinary tract infection/inflammation (6.2% [15/243]), enteritis/colitis (5.3% [13/243]), and pneumonia (4.9% [12/243]). A positive ER CT was associated with patient admission (p = 0.01).

Herein, we present our preliminary report on the feasibility, quality of life, and patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) for localized prostate cancer (PC) treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).  Methods:   The SBRT protocol consisted of a 35 Gy schedule delivered in 5 fractions within 2 weeks. Toxicity and quality of life (QoL) were assessed at baseline and after treatment using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0, International Prostatic Symptoms Score (IPSS), ICIQ-SF, IIEF-5, and EORTC-QLQ-C30 and PR-25 questionnaires.  Results:   Between October 2019 and January 2020, 25 patients with localized PC were recruited. The median age was 68 years (range, 54-82); 4 were low risk, 11 favorable intermediate risk (IR) and 10 unfavorable IR. Median iPSA was 6.8 ng/ml (range, 1-19), and 9 of these patients (36%) received concurrent androgen deprivation therapy. Median prostate volume was 36 cc (range, 20-61); median baseline IPSS was 5 (range, 0-10). Median time for fraction was 53 min (range, 34-86); adaptive strategy with daily critical structure and target re-contouring and daily replanning (adapt to shape) was performed in all cases.

Various articles introduced that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are found in vital functions in the development and progression of cancers. Although SNHG3 (small nucleolar RNA host gene 3) has been investigated in many cancers, now researches on the role and mechanism of SNHG3 in prostate cancer are lacked. In this work, SNHG3 exerted high expression in prostate cancer cell lines. Suppression of SNHG3 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) process and promoted cell apoptosis. Additionally, it was found that SNHG3 could bind with miR-577. Subsequently, SMURF1 (Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 1) was identified as a downstream target of miR-577 and had a negative correlation with miR-577. SNHG3 was found to positively regulate SMURF1 expression. Furthermore, rescue assays demonstrated that co-transfection of pcDNA3.1/SMURF1 reversed the effects of SNHG3 knockdown in cell proliferation, migration, EMT process and cell apoptosis. SNHG3 also promoted tumorigenesis in vivo. All the results above explained that SNHG3 accelerated prostate cancer progression by sponging miR-577 to up-regulate SMURF1 expression, suggesting that SNHG3 may act as a biomarker for prostate cancer patients.""","""['Teng Li', 'Yi Xing', 'Fan Yang', 'Yangyang Sun', 'Shaojin Zhang', 'Qingwei Wang', 'Weixing Zhang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['LncRNA SNHG3 promotes bladder cancer proliferation and metastasis through miR-515-5p/GINS2 axis.', 'LncRNA SNHG3 Promotes Proliferation and Metastasis of Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Cells Through miR-515-5p/SUMO2 Axis.', 'Long Noncoding RNA Small Nucleolar RNA Host Gene 3 Mediates Prostate Cancer Migration, Invasion, and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition by Sponging miR-487a-3p to Regulate TRIM25.', 'Small nucleolar RNA host gene 3 functions as a novel biomarker in liver cancer and other tumour progression.', 'Functional mechanism and clinical implications of MicroRNA-423 in human cancers.', 'Importance of long non-coding RNAs in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic values of long noncoding RNA in bone metastasis of prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Molecular Cluster Mining of Adrenocortical Carcinoma via Multi-Omics Data Analysis Aids Precise Clinical Therapy.', 'miR-302a-3p Promotes Radiotherapy Sensitivity of Hepatocellular Carcinoma by Regulating Cell Cycle via MCL1.', 'Long non-coding RNA SNHG3 promotes prostate cancer progression by sponging microRNA-1827.']"""

However, the number of experimentally verified lncRNA-disease associations is very limited. Thus, various computational approaches are proposed to predict lncRNA-disease associations. Current matrix factorization-based methods cannot capture the complex non-linear relationship between lncRNAs and diseases, and traditional machine learning-based methods are not sufficiently powerful to learn the representation of lncRNAs and diseases. Considering these limitations in existing computational methods, we propose a deep matrix factorization model to predict lncRNA-disease associations (DMFLDA in short). DMFLDA uses a cascade of non-linear hidden layers to learn latent representation to represent lncRNAs and diseases. By using non-linear hidden layers, DMFLDA captures the more complex non-linear relationship between lncRNAs and diseases than traditional matrix factorization-based methods. In addition, DMFLDA learns features directly from the lncRNA-disease interaction matrix and thus can obtain more accurate representation learning for lncRNAs and diseases than traditional machine learning methods. The low dimensional representations of the lncRNAs and diseases are fused to estimate the new interaction value. To evaluate the performance of DMFLDA, we perform leave-one-out cross-validation and 5-fold cross-validation on known experimentally verified lncRNA-disease associations. The experimental results show that DMFLDA performs better than the existing methods. The case studies show that many predicted interactions of colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, and renal cancer have been verified by recent biomedical literature.

We showed 7d not only bound to AR, suppressed transactivation of wild-type AR (wt-AR) and the mutant that mediates Enzalutamide resistance, but also reduced c-Myc protein expression through BET inhibition. In addition, 7d inhibited the proliferation of AR-positive PC cells with favorable selectivity and suppressed AR-V7-expressing VCaP and 22Rv1 xenografts growth in vivo.

AmPPDs bears natural lipid derivative DSPE as the hydrophobic tail and different dendritic l-lysine as the hydrophilic head, capable of compacting siRNA into nanoparticles to protect it from enzymatic degradation. Interestingly, DSPE-KK2, AmPPD bearing smaller hydrophilic dendron, promoting more efficient intracellular uptake and endosome release of the so-formed siRNA complexes, as well as better siRNA releasing ability, ultimately resulting in more potent gene silencing and anticancer effects both in vitro and in vivo.

This research aimed to illustrate the probabilistic mechanism of CD133-siRNA and paclitaxel in the reduction of chemoresistance in PC cells. To measure the cell viability, migratory capacity, CSCs properties, invasive potential, apoptosis and cell cycle progression of the cells, the MTT, wound healing, spheroid assay, colony formation assay, DAPI staining and flow cytometry assays were applied in the LNCaP cell line, respectively. Also, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot method were used for measuring the expression of CD133 and the effects of CD133 silencing on the AKT/mTOR/c-myc axis and pro-metastatic genes expression. We showed that the CD133-siRNA considerably decreased the CD133 expression. Moreover, CD133-siRNA and paclitaxel treatment significantly decreased cell proliferation and also inhibited the ability of cell migration and invasion and reduced pro-metastatic genes expression. Additionally, we found that the simultaneous use of CD133-siRNA and paclitaxel increased the paclitaxel-induced apoptosis.

CAM were compared against carcinoma presence, clinicopathologic findings, and grade groups (GG) 1 to 2 vs 3 to 5. The frequency of CAM according to anatomic zone was counted. A pilot study was conducted using paired initial benign and repeat biopsies (33 benign, 24 carcinoma).  Results:   A total of 68.9% of biopsies, 96.4% of prostatectomies, and 66.7% of TURs disclosed CAM. CAM ≥1 was common at an older age (P = .019). In biopsies, 204 cases (75%) had carcinoma; and CAM of 2 to 3 (compared to 0-1) were recorded in 25.0% of carcinomas but only 7.4% of benign biopsies (P = .005; odds ratio [OR] = 5.1). CAM correlated with high percent Gleason pattern 3, low GG (P = .035), and chronic inflammation (CI). CI correlated inversely with carcinoma (P = .003). CAM disclosed no association with race, body mass index, serum prostate specific antigen (PSA), acute inflammation (in biopsies), atrophy, or carcinoma volume. With CAM 1, the odds of GG 3 to 5 carcinoma, by comparison to CAM 0, decreased more than 2× (OR = 0.48; P = .032), with CAM 2, more than 3× (OR = 0.33; P = .005), and with CAM 3, almost 3× (OR = 0.39, P = .086). For men aged less than 65, carcinoma predictive model was: Score = (2 × age) + (5 × PSA) - (20 × degree of CAM); using our data, area under the ROC curve was 78.17%. When the transition zone was involved by cancer, it showed more CAM than in cases where it was uninvolved (P = .012); otherwise zonal distributions were similar. In the pilot study, CAM ≥1 predicted carcinoma on repeat biopsy (P < .05; OR = 8), as did CAM 2 to 3 (P < .0001; OR = 30). CI was not significant, and CAM retained significance after adjusting for CI.  Conclusion:   CAM correlate with carcinoma. Whether abundant CAM in benign biopsies adds value amidst high clinical suspicion, warrants further study.""","""['Watchareepohn Palangmonthip', 'Ruizhe Wu', 'Sergey Tarima', 'Samuel A Bobholz', 'Peter S LaViolette', 'Alexander J Gallan', 'Kenneth A Iczkowski']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Corpora amylacea in prostatectomy tissue and associations with molecular, histological, and lifestyle factors.', 'Prostate cancer after initial high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and benign prostate biopsy.', 'The extent and zonal location of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and atypical adenomatous hyperplasia: relationship with carcinoma in radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Precursors of prostate cancer.', 'Repeat biopsy strategy in patients with atypical small acinar proliferation or high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia on initial prostate needle biopsy.', 'The Etiology and Pathophysiology Genesis of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Prostate Cancer: A New Perspective.']"""

Drugs targeting these proteins could be of importance in developing anti-cancer drugs.  Objectives:   We inferred that drugs like loperamide and promethazine that act as antagonists of proteins conserved in cancer cells like voltage-gated Calcium channels (Cav), Calmodulin (CaM) and drug efflux (ABCB1) pump may have the potential to be re-purposed as an anti-cancer agent in Prostate Cancer (PCa).  Methods:   Growth and cytotoxic assays were performed by selecting loperamide and promethazine to target Cav, CaM and drug efflux (ABCB1) pumps to elucidate their effects on androgen-independent PC3 and DU145 PCa cell lines.  Result:   We show that loperamide and promethazine in doses of 80-100μg/ml exert oncocidal effects when tested in DU145 and PC3 cell lines. Diphenhydramine, which shares its targets with promethazine, except the CaM, failed to exhibit oncocidal effects.  Conclusion:   Anti-cancer effects can be of significance if structural analogues of loperamide and promethazine that specifically target Cav, CaM and ABCB1 drug efflux pumps can be synthesized, or these two drugs could be re-purposed after human trials in PCa.""","""['Abdul M Baig', 'Zohaib Rana', 'Mohammad M Mannan', 'Areeba Khaleeq', 'Fizza Nazim', 'Preet Katyara', 'Farhat Abbas']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Anticancer Agents Med Chem""","""['Antibiotic Effects of Loperamide: Homology of Human Targets of Loperamide with Targets in Acanthamoeba spp.', 'Discovery of phenylselenoether-hydantoin hybrids as ABCB1 efflux pump modulating agents with cytotoxic and antiproliferative actions in resistant T-lymphoma.', 'Reversal effect of FW-04-806, a macrolide dilactone compound, on multidrug resistance mediated by ABCB1 and ABCG2 in vitro and in vivo.', 'Potentiation of the antiproliferative activity of MKT-077 by loperamide, diltiazem and tamoxifen.', 'New anti-mitotic drugs with distinct anti-calmodulin activity.']"""

While PROs are increasingly employed in clinical practice, research utilizing these data remains limited. Our goal was to evaluate PROs from a provincial cancer program.  Methods:   A retrospective, population-based cohort study using administrative health data of patients in Alberta, Canada, diagnosed with cancer between January 1, 2016, and October 23, 2017. Adults who completed PROs (Edmonton Symptom Assessment System, ESAS) and supportive care needs inventory (Canadian Problem Checklist)) within ± 60 days of diagnosis were included. Patients were stratified by tumor types (breast, colorectal, lung, prostate, hematological, or other). Descriptive statistics were used to characterize symptom burden and supportive care needs. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with higher symptom severity.  Results:   We included 1310 patients (mean age 64 years; 51% female), the majority of whom had breast (19%), lung (25%), or other cancers (26%). For the cohort, severity of symptoms based on ESAS was low, but prevalence of specific symptoms was high including tiredness (84%), anxiety (60%), pain (60%), and low well-being (80%). Seventy percent of the cohort reported at least one supportive care need. The highest-ranking problems were fears and worries and needing information about illness/treatment. There were differences across tumor types with respect to symptoms and supportive care needs. Comorbidity and having a high number of supportive care needs were associated with higher symptom severity.

What is relatively less known is if this translates into immune-cell (IC) infiltration into the tumor microenvironment. This study examined whether neoadjuvant prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-targeted vaccination with PROSTVAC could induce T-cell immunity, particularly at the tumor site.  Methods:   An open-label, phase II study of neoadjuvant PROSTVAC vaccine enrolled 27 patients with localized prostate cancer awaiting radical prostatectomy (RP). We evaluated increases in CD4 and CD8 T-cell infiltrates (RP tissue vs baseline biopsies) using a six-color multiplex immunofluorescence Opal method. Antigen-specific responses were assessed by intracellular cytokine staining after in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with overlapping 15-mer peptide pools encoding the TAAs PSA, brachyury and MUC-1.  Results:   Of 27 vaccinated patients, 26 had matched prevaccination (biopsy) and postvaccination (RP) prostate samples available for non-compartmentalized analysis (NCA) and compartmentalized analysis (CA). Tumor CD4 T-cell infiltrates were significantly increased in postvaccination RP specimens compared with baseline biopsies by NCA (median 176/mm² vs 152/mm²; IQR 136-317/mm² vs 69-284/mm²; p=0.0249; median ratio 1.20; IQR 0.64-2.25). By CA, an increase in both CD4 T-cell infiltrates at the tumor infiltrative margin (median 198/mm² vs 151/mm²; IQR 123-500/mm² vs 85-256/mm²; p=0.042; median ratio 1.44; IQR 0.59-4.17) and in CD8 T-cell infiltrates at the tumor core (median 140/mm² vs 105/mm²; IQR 91-175/mm² vs 83-163/mm²; p=0.036; median ratio 1.25; IQR 0.88-2.09) were noted in postvaccination RP specimens compared with baseline biopsies. A total of 13/25 patients (52%) developed peripheral T-cell responses to any of the three tested TAAs (non-neoantigens); five of these had responses to more than one antigen of the three evaluated.

Since its implementation is still limited by lack of a formal external validation, we aimed to validate this tool in a large contemporary cohort. We identified 487 patients diagnosed using MRI-targeted with concomitant systematic biopsy who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) and an anatomically defined ePLND at six centers. The external validity of the 2019 Briganti nomogram for estimating LNI risk was assessed via calibration, discrimination, and decision curve analyses (DCAs). A total of 38 (8%) patients had LNI at final pathology. The median number of nodes removed was 18 (interquartile range 14-24). On external validation, the 2019 Briganti nomogram had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 79%. Although there was some miscalibration, this was at predicted probabilities >35% and therefore outside the clinically relevant range. DCA demonstrated that the 2019 Briganti nomogram improved clinical risk prediction against LNI threshold probabilities of ≤30%. For a 7% cutoff, 273 (56%) ePLNDs would be spared and only 2.6% LNIs would be missed. The 2019 Briganti nomogram was characterized by higher AUC compared to the 2012 and 2017 Briganti nomograms and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center risk calculator (79% vs 75% vs 65% vs 74%) and demonstrated the highest net benefit on DCA. This first multi-institutional validation of the 2019 Briganti nomogram in predicting LNI in PCa patients diagnosed with MRI-targeted biopsy confirms the highest AUC, better calibration and the highest net benefit compared with available tools and should be adopted to identify candidates for ePLND among men diagnosed with MRI-targeted biopsy. PATIENT SUMMARY: We performed the first multi-institutional validation of the first nomogram predicting lymph node invasion specifically developed using data from prostate cancer patients diagnosed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-targeted biopsy.

In order to improve the evaluation of the outcome, we have studied oligometastatic prostate cancer patients who were treated with stereotactic radiation therapy.  Patients and methods:   24 patients with a total of 30 bone metastases were included in the study. We examined the response to SBRT (biochemical and imaging), as well as progression-free survival and time to start of antihormonal therapy (aHT).  Results:   The mean follow-up interval after completion of SBRT was 32.7 months (1.4 - 84 months). The SBRT was well tolerated, without acute or late adverse effects. In 16 patients, the PSA value decreased from a mean of 4.58 ng/mL (0.05 - 50.25 ng/mL) before SBRT to 1.19 ng/mL (0.01 - 8.85 ng/mL) after completion of SBRT. The mean biochemical progression-free survival of these patients was 17.6 months (0.7 - 85.0 months). Six patients received aHT, either before or during SBRT. In ten patients, the aHT was initiated after a mean interval of 20.6 months (1.8 - 85.0 months) after completion of the SBRT. Another six patients were not given any aHT during the whole period of observation. In 18 of 30 metastases, there was a decrease in PSMA expression within the area of SBRT in the PSMA-PET - in accordance with a partial functional response. In five patients, PSMA hyperexpression was unchanged; in 7 patients there was no PSMA imaging for follow up. In 17 patients, distant metastasis progression was diagnosed by imaging after a mean of 16.2 months (1.6 - 40.6 months). Three patients had a local recurrence in the prostatic fossa.  Conclusion:   SBRT of bone metastases in oligometastatic prostate carcinoma patients is an effective and well tolerated therapy and can help to achieve high local control in the area of the metastases as well as delay the start or the escalation of systemic therapy. Nevertheless, the high rate of progression of distant metastases shows how important correct patient selection is and that combination with aHT may be necessary.""","""['Eva Katharina Sage', 'Marco M E Vogel', 'Sabrina Dewes', 'Michal Devecka', 'Matthias Eiber', 'Jürgen E Gschwend', 'Stephanie E Combs', 'Kilian Schiller']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Aktuelle Urol""","""['Oligometastases from prostate cancer: local treatment with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA-PET/CT)-guided stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy for oligometastatic prostate cancer: a single-institution experience and review of the published literature.', 'Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer Detected via Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography.', 'Repeated stereotactic body radiotherapy for oligometastatic prostate cancer recurrence.', 'A Review of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in the Management of Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Local control of 1-5 fraction radiotherapy regimens for spinal metastases: an analysis of the impacts of biologically effective dose and primary histology.', 'Immunomodulatory Effects of Radiotherapy.']"""

Since 2011, abiraterone acetate has been available in combination with prednisone/prednisolone (AA + P) for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) after pre-treatment with docetaxel, and since 2012 for the treatment of chemotherapy-naïve asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic mCRPC patients. A revision of the guidelines of the European Association of Urology in 2014 redefining castration resistance gave rise to the question of when the treatment of mCRPC with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone should be initiated after prior hormone treatment and how successful it would be. This led us to observe an early-onset AA + P therapy cohort (EC) and a late-onset therapy cohort (LC) of patients.  Patients and methods:   We designed a combined retrospective and prospective, multicentre, non-interventional two-cohort study to obtain data on the effectiveness and safety of an early-onset AA + P therapy in mCRPC patients in the clinical routine compared to a late therapy onset. The EC comprised patients who received AA + P immediately after castration resistance without a prior first-generation antiandrogen such as bicalutamide or flutamide. The LC included patients who, after castration resistance had occurred, started treatment with AA + P only after unsuccessful treatment with a first-generation antiandrogen. Patients with mCRPC who received AA + P therapy according to the physician's routine clinical practice decision were considered. The patients were consecutively included in the study on the basis of their medical records, with the treatment decision having been made independently of and before patient enrolment. Patients were documented or followed from the beginning of AA + P therapy until the start of a carcinoma-specific systemic follow-up therapy (retrospectively if before and prospectively if after start of data collection). Effectiveness analyses were done for all patients with at least two AA + P administrations and safety analyses for all treated patients.  Results:   Of the 159 patients included, 44 received early therapy and 105 received later therapy with AA + P. 10 patients could not be clearly assigned and were summarised in a third cohort (missed early-onset therapy assignment; MEC). 56/159 patients (35.2 %) were still alive at study start and 103/159 patients (64.8 %) had already deceased (31/44 [70.5 %] in EC, 64/105 [61.0 %] in LC, and 8/10 [80.0 %] in MEC). 24/159 patients (15.1 %) were documented both retrospectively and prospectively. The median duration of AA + P treatment was 11.3 months for EC, 12.0 months for LC, and 8.3 months for MEC patients. The median time to next systemic cancer therapy or death was 12.3 months for EC and 12.8 months for LC patients (p = 0.2820). The median time to the next systemic cancer therapy alone (i. e. without the event 'death') was 22.7 months for EC and 23.3 months for LC patients (p = 0.5995). Median overall survival (OS) was 22.3 months for EC and 39.2 months for LC patients (p = 0.0232). The incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was low. SAEs occurred in 3/44 EC (6.8 %), 4/105 LC (3.8 %), and 1/10 MEC patients (10.0 %). One SAE in EC and one in LC resulted in death.  Conclusions:   In contrast to the new definition of castration resistance, AA + P was still more frequently used in daily clinical practice during the study observation period in patients treated with antiandrogens of the first generation after occurrence of castration resistance. Nevertheless, AA + P therapy appears to be effective and well tolerated during clinical routine in mCRPC patients. A comparison of the study results with earlier 'real-world' studies, however, has to take limiting factors into account. The observed difference in median overall survival might be explained by the imbalance of baseline characteristics between both cohorts with regard to number of patients, patients already deceased at start of documentation, patients with visceral metastases and patients with opioids at start of AA + P. For these reasons, patients in the EC initially might have had a poorer prognosis. A prospective randomised and controlled clinical trial would therefore be necessary to assess a possible difference in overall survival and response of the AA + P treatment with respect to therapy onset.""","""['Axel S Merseburger', 'Christoph Rüssel', 'Hanjo Belz', 'Philipp Spiegelhalder', 'Susan Feyerabend', 'Nguyen Tran', 'Katrin Kruetzfeldt', 'Werner Baurecht', 'Martin Bögemann']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Aktuelle Urol""","""['Updated interim efficacy analysis and long-term safety of abiraterone acetate in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients without prior chemotherapy (COU-AA-302).', 'Apalutamide plus abiraterone acetate and prednisone versus placebo plus abiraterone and prednisone in metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (ACIS): a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multinational, phase 3 study.', 'Impact of bone-targeted therapies in chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with abiraterone acetate: post hoc analysis of study COU-AA-302.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

We aimed to disclose the prognostic values of examined (dissected) lymph node (ELN), negative lymph node (NLN), and positive (metastatic) lymph node (PLN) counts and lymph node (LNs) ratio in PCa patients.  Methods:   We extracted data of PCa patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2015 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. We included patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis having at least one ELN and with the PCa as the primary tumor only.  Results:   We have included 96,064 patients. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression modelsdisclosed that patients having more ELNs were associated with better survival. However, we demonstrated that patients having more PLNs were associated with worse survival. Additionally, older age, unmarried patients, with Gleason's score of 8-10, T4 and M1 stages and those who received chemotherapy and/or radiation but did not receive surgery were significantly associated with worse PCa survival.  Conclusions:   We have disclosed several independent predictors affecting PCa patients including age, marital status, Gleason's score, T and N stages, having received therapy, surgery, and ELN and PLN counts.

The use of multimodal imaging, such as MR-PET, is most advantageous as it is able to provide detailed information about the prostate. However, as the human prostate is flexible and can move into different positions under external conditions, it is important to localise the focused region-of-interest using both MRI and PET under identical circumstances. In this work, we designed five commonly used linear and quadrature radiofrequency surface coils suitable for hybrid MR-PET use in endorectal applications. Due to the endorectal design and the shielded PET insert, the outer face of the coils investigated was curved and the region to be imaged was outside the volume of the coil. The tilting angles of the coils were varied with respect to the main magnetic field direction. This was done to approximate the various positions from which the prostate could be imaged. The transmit efficiencies and safety excitation efficiencies from simulations, together with the signal-to-noise ratios from the MR images were calculated and analysed. Overall, it was found that the overlapped loops driven in quadrature were superior to the other types of coils we tested. In order to determine the effect of the different coil designs on PET, transmission scans were carried out, and it was observed that the differences between attenuation maps with and without the coils were negligible. The findings of this work can provide useful guidance for the integration of such coil designs into MR-PET hybrid systems in the future.""","""['Chang-Hoon Choi', 'Tim Felder', 'Jörg Felder', 'Lutz Tellmann', 'Suk-Min Hong', 'Hans-Peter Wegener', 'N Jon Shah', 'Karl Ziemons']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Integrated PET/MR breast cancer imaging: Attenuation correction and implementation of a 16-channel RF coil.', 'Development of PET/MRI with insertable PET for simultaneous PET and MR imaging of human brain.', 'Hybrid Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Challenges, Methods, and State of the Art of Hardware Component Attenuation Correction.', 'Performance evaluation of RF coils integrated with an RF-penetrable PET insert for simultaneous PET/MRI.', 'Attenuation Correction for Magnetic Resonance Coils in Combined PET/MR Imaging: A Review.', 'MRI/PET Imaging in elevated PSA and localized prostate cancer: a narrative review.']"""

The aim of this study was to identify cell free DNA- (cfDNA-) based alterations and their associations with outcomes in progressive metastatic prostate cancer.  Methods:   In this longitudinal prospective cohort study plasma cfDNA/circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) was analyzed before, during, and after androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in 4 independent patient groups ranging from untreated metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) to metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Next generation sequencing was performed on ctDNA and germline DNA to characterize alterations and associations with clinical outcomes were determined for each group.  Findings:   cfDNA yields were different in progressive mHSPC and mCRPC states (P < .001). In mHSPC, a higher than median ctDNA fraction was predictive of shorter time to ADT failure (HR, 2.29 [95% CI, 1.13-4.65]; Log-Rank P = .02). cfDNA, ctDNA taken with volume of metastatic disease in mHSPC and with alkaline phosphatase levels prognosticated survival better than clinical factors alone in mHSPC and mCRPC states (Log Rank P = 0.03). ctDNA-based AR, APC mutations were increased in mCRPC compared to mHSPC (P < ·05).TP53 mutations, RB1 loss, and AR gene amplifications correlated with poorer survival in mCRPC. Mutations in multiple DNA repair genes (ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2) were associated with time to ADT treatment failure and survival in mHSPC.  Interpretation:   ctDNA fraction can further refine clinical prognostic factors in metastatic prostate cancer. Somatic ctDNA alterations have potential prognostic, predictive, and therapeutic implications in metastatic prostate cancer management.  Funding:   Several funding sources have supported this study.

Methods:   An invitation to take part in the study was sent to the Heads of all UK radiotherapy departments and posted on the UK Medical Physics mailbase. Individuals interested in participating were able to access a single anonymised CT dataset for download with the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, bladder, rectum, bowel, femoral heads, and penile bulb outlined. A brief patient history was also supplied. Participants were asked to create planning target volumes (PTVs) according to their local clinical protocol and plan to give 60 Gy in 20 fractions to the PTV receiving the highest dose. No guidance was given for acceptable organ at risk doses. Dicom plan and dose information was loaded back into ProKnow for analysis by contributors.  Results:   There were 102 plan submissions made to the study representing 48 different UK radiotherapy departments. Seventeen distinct methodologies for creating the prescription PTV from the prostate and seminal vesicles were identified with the ethos of the CHHIP trial protocol for margin growing followed in nearly two-thirds of cases. Positive correlations were found when assessing the doses received by the bladder and rectum against the volume of the PTV to which 60 Gy was prescribed.  Conclusions:   A national planning study whereby staff from a multitude of radiotherapy departments create plans based solely on a single dataset is feasible. The cohort of data was made available to all participants following the study to enable self-assessment and benchmarking against that of their peers.

Our objective was to determine the prevalence of survivorship care plan receipt for survivors of genitourinary malignancy including kidney, prostate and bladder cancer, and evaluate whether receipt was associated with a measurable health benefit.  Materials and methods:   Data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Cancer Survivorship modules in 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2017 were analyzed. The proportion of patients with bladder, kidney or prostate cancer receiving a survivorship care plan was calculated. Complex samples multivariable logistic regressions were performed to determine the association of survivorship care plan receipt with sociodemographic variables, and assess the relationship between survivorship care plan receipt and self-reported health status (general, physical and mental).  Results:   Survivorship care plan distribution increased from 27.5% in 2012 to 39.5% in 2017. Patients with low income, less formal education and extremes of age were less likely to receive a survivorship care plan. Those receiving a survivorship care plan were less likely to report poor physical health (OR 0.70, CI 0.52-0.96, p=0.026). Subanalysis showed a similar result for physical health of patients with prostate cancer (OR 0.68, CI 0.48-0.96, p=0.030) and general health of patients with kidney cancer (OR 0.37, CI 0.19-0.75, p=0.006).  Conclusions:   Distribution of survivorship care plans to genitourinary malignancy survivors has increased since 2012 in response to advocacy from national organizations. Nonetheless, utilization is low and there is heterogeneity in the populations likely to receive a survivorship care plan. There is a measurable association between survivorship care plans and improved health status but further study is needed to determine causality.""","""['Joshua A Linscott', 'Madeline C Rutan', 'Paul K J Han', 'Moritz H Hansen', 'Matthew H Hayn', 'Stephen T Ryan', 'Quoc-Dien Trinh', 'Jesse D Sammon']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Receipt of a survivorship care plan and self-reported health behaviors among cancer survivors.', 'Disparities in Cancer Survivorship Indicators in the Deep South Based on BRFSS Data: Recommendations for Survivorship Care Plans.', 'Dissemination of cancer survivorship care plans: who is being left out?', 'Tailoring survivorship to diverse populations with genitourinary malignancies.', 'The Role of Survivorship Care for Patients with Glioma.']"""

Methods:   Twelve patients with low or intermediate-risk of prostate cancer referred for external-beam radiotherapy were included in this study. Three computed tomography-based VMAT plans were created for each study participant. The first plan was generated by assuming patient's irradiation with SF-VMAT (78 Gy in 39 fractions). The second and third plans were created on the basis of two different HF schedules (HF-VMAT1 : 70 Gy in 30 fractions, HF:VMAT2 : 60 Gy in 20 fractions). Data from differential dose-volume histograms obtained by the above treatment plans were employed to calculate the organ equivalent dose (OED) of the bladder and rectum with the aid of a nonlinear model accounting for fractionation and proliferation effects. The calculated OED values were used to estimate the average lifetime attributable risk (LARav ) for the appearance of radiotherapy-induced secondary bladder and rectal malignancies. The lifetime risk of radiation carcinogenesis was compared with the respective organ-, and age-dependent lifetime intrinsic risk (LIR) of cancer development for unexposed males.  Results:   The average OED of the rectum from SF-VMAT, HF-VMAT1 and HF-VMAT2 for prostate cancer was 972.0, 900.2, and 815.7 cGy, respectively. The corresponding values for bladder were 73.4, 72.3, and 71.0 cGy. The LARav for rectal cancer induction varied from 0.06% to 0.4% by the fractionation schedule used for irradiation and by the age of the patient at the time of treatment. The corresponding risk range related to the development of secondary bladder malignancies was 0.06-0.33%. The SF-VMAT, HF-VMAT1 and HF-VMAT2 led to an increase of the lifetime rectal cancer risk with respect to LIR by 2.2-9.8%, 2.0-9.1% and 1.8-8.2%, respectively, depending upon the patient's age. The corresponding elevation for bladder cancer induction was up to 8.0%, 7.9% and 7.7%.  Conclusions:   The use of VMAT for prostate carcinoma leads to a noteworthy increase of the lifetime risk for bladder and rectal cancer induction compared to that of unexposed people irrespective of the patient's age at the time of treatment and the applied fractionation scheme.

Materials and methods:   The mpMRI examinations of the patients who underwent RP due to PCa were retrospectively evaluated. According to the final GS, the lesions were divided into two groups as clinically significant (GS ≥ 7) and insignificant (GS ≤ 6). The PSA value, tumor ADCmin value, tumor diameter, and PI-RADS score were compared between the clinically significant and nonsignificant PCa groups using Student's t-test. The correlations between the serum PSA level, GS, PI-RADS v2 score, tumor ADCmin value, and tumor diameter were evaluated separately (Pearson's correlation analysis was used for peripheral gland tumors, and Spearman's correlation analysis for central gland tumors). A ROC analysis was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of the tumor ADCmin, diameter and PSA values in differentiating clinically significant and nonsignificant tumors.  Results:   In both central and peripheral gland tumors, there was a correlation between the PSA level, tumor diameter, PI-RADS score, ADCmin value, and GS at various levels (poor, moderate, and high). In central gland tumors, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the PSA value and PI-RADS scores (p > 0.05), but the ADCmin value and diameter of the tumor significantly differed (p < 0.05). For peripheral gland tumors, significant differences were observed in all parameters (p < 0.05). The cut-off values for the peripheral and central gland tumors are as follows: lesion diameter, 13.5 mm and 19 mm; tumor ADCmin, 0.709 × 10-3 mm2/s and 0.874 × 10-3 mm2/s; and PSA level, 8.47 ng/ml and 11.10 ng/ml, respectively.  Conclusion:   The current PI-RADS v2 scoring system can be inadequate in distinguishing clinically significant and insignificant groups in central gland tumors. A separate cut-off value of the tumor diameter should be determined for central and peripheral gland tumors. Tumor ADCmin values can be used as a predictive parameter.

The interaction mechanisms between different genes and signaling pathways, however, are still unclear.  Methods:   Variation analysis of GSE38241, GSE69223, GSE46602 and GSE104749 were realized by GEO2R in Gene Expression Omnibus database. Function enrichment was analyzed by DAVID.6.8. Furthermore, the PPI network and the significant module were analyzed by Cytoscape, STRING and MCODE.GO. Pathway analysis showed that the 20 candidate genes were closely related to mitosis, cell division, cell cycle phases and the p53 signaling pathway. A total of six independent prognostic factors were identified in GSE21032 and TCGA PRAD. Oncomine database and The Human Protein Atlas were applied to explicit that six core genes were over expression in prostate cancer compared to normal prostate tissue in the process of transcriptional and translational. Finally, gene set enrichment were performed to identified the related pathway of core genes involved in prostate cancer.  Result:   Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that these 20 core genes were mostly related to carcinogenesis and development. CKS2, TK1, MKI67, TOP2A, CCNB1 and RRM2 directly related to the recurrence and prognosis of prostate cancer. This result was verified by TCGA database and GSE21032.  Conclusion:   These core genes play a crucial role in tumor carcinogenesis, development, recurrence, metastasis and progression. Identifying these genes could help us to understand the molecular mechanisms and provide potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Yutao Wang#', 'Jianfeng Wang#', 'Kexin Yan', 'Jiaxing Lin', 'Zhenhua Zheng', 'Jianbin Bi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PeerJ""","""['Bioinformatics Analysis of Candidate Genes and Pathways Related to Hepatocellular Carcinoma in China: A Study Based on Public Databases.', 'Identification of core genes and outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma by bioinformatics analysis.', 'Identification of Flap endonuclease 1 as a potential core gene in hepatocellular carcinoma by integrated bioinformatics analysis.', 'Identification of latent biomarkers in connection with progression and prognosis in oral cancer by comprehensive bioinformatics analysis.', 'Transcriptome analysis revealed CENPF associated with glioma prognosis.', 'A novel machine learning-based programmed cell death-related clinical diagnostic and prognostic model associated with immune infiltration in endometrial cancer.', 'Novel methylation-related long non-coding RNA clinical outcome prediction method: the clinical phenotype and immune infiltration research in low-grade gliomas.', 'Computational Biology Helps Understand How Polyploid Giant Cancer Cells Drive Tumor Success.', 'Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals Influence Hub Genes Associated with Aggressive Prostate Cancer.', 'Assessing the Potential Prognostic and Immunological Role of TK1 in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Recently, with the deep research of N6-methyladenine (m6A) mRNA methylation, many studies directly focus on the role of m6A modification in human diseases, especially in cancers. Here we found that methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) expression is higher in PCa than in normal prostate tissues, especially in PCa with bone metastasis. High METTL3 expression was positively correlated with advanced progression and a poor prognosis of PCa. Functional assays demonstrated that METTL3 regulates the expression of Integrin β1 (ITGB1) through m6A-HuR-dependent mechanism, which affects the binding of ITGB1 to Collagen I and tumor cell motility, so as to promote the bone metastasis of PCa.

While RB1-mutant cells fail to arrest at G1-S in response to cell-cycle restriction point signals, this information has not led to effective strategies to treat RB1-deficient tumors, as it is challenging to develop targeted drugs for tumors that are driven by the loss of gene function. Our group previously identified Skp2, a substrate recruiting subunit of the SCF-Skp2 E3 ubiquitin ligase, as an early repression target of pRb whose knockout blocked tumorigenesis in Rb1-deficient prostate and pituitary tumors. Here we used genetic mouse models to demonstrate that deletion of Skp2 completely blocked the formation of SCLC in Rb1/Trp53-knockout mice (RP mice). Skp2 KO caused an increased accumulation of the Skp2-degradation target p27, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, which was confirmed as the mechanism of protection by using knock-in of a mutant p27 that was unable to bind to Skp2. Building on the observed synthetic lethality between Rb1 and Skp2, we found that small molecules that bind/inhibit Skp2 have in vivo antitumor activity in mouse tumors and human patient-derived xenograft models of SCLC. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, antitumor activity was seen with Skp2 loss or inhibition in established SCLC primary lung tumors, in liver metastases, and in chemotherapy-resistant tumors. Our data highlight a downstream actionable target in RB1-deficient cancers, for which there are currently no targeted therapies available. SIGNIFICANCE: There are no effective therapies for SCLC.

The cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) plays an important role in inflammation. Several studies have focused on the association between TNF-α polymorphisms and prostate cancer development. Our meta-analysis aimed to estimate the association between TNF-α rs1800629 (- 308 G/A), rs361525 (- 238 G/A) and rs1799724 polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk.  Methods:   Eligible studies were identified from electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Wanfang and CNKI) using keywords: TNF-α, polymorphism, prostate cancer, until Nov 15, 2019. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were applied to determine the association from a quantitative point-of-view. Publication bias and sensitivity analysis were also applied to evaluate the power of current study. All statistical analyses were done with Stata 11.0 software.  Results:   Twenty-two different articles were included (22 studies about rs1800629; 8 studies for rs361525 and 5 studies related to rs1799724). Overall, no significant association was found between rs1800629 and rs1799724 polymorphisms and the risk of prostate cancer in the whole (such as: OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.92-1.16, P = 0.580 in the allele for rs1800629; OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.84-1.07, P = 0.381 in the allele for rs1799724). The rs361525 polymorphism also had no association with prostate cancer in the cases (OR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.66-1.32, P = 0.684 in the allele) and ethnicity subgroup. The stratified subgroup of genotype method, however, revealed that the rs361525 variant significantly decreased the risk of prostate cancer in the Others (OR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.47-0.89, P = 0.008, A-allele vs G-allele) and PCR-RFLP (OR = 2.68, 95% CI = 1.00-7.20, P = 0.050, AG vs GG or AA+AG vs GG) methods.

Autophagy-related genes (ARGs) may play an essential role in multiple biological processes of prostate cancer. However, ARGs expression signature has rarely been used to investigate the association between autophagy and prognosis in PCa. This study aimed to identify and assess prognostic ARGs signature to predict overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in PCa patients.  Methods:   First, a total of 234 autophagy-related genes were obtained from The Human Autophagy Database. Then, differentially expressed ARGs were identified in prostate cancer patients based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to screen hub prognostic ARGs for overall survival and disease-free survival, and the prognostic model was constructed. Finally, the correlation between the prognostic model and clinicopathological parameters was further analyzed, including age, T status, N status, and Gleason score.  Results:   The OS-related prognostic model was constructed based on the five ARGs (FAM215A, FDD, MYC, RHEB, and ATG16L1) and significantly stratified prostate cancer patients into high- and low-risk groups in terms of OS (HR = 6.391, 95% CI = 1.581- 25.840, P < 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the prediction model was 0.84. The OS-related prediction model values were higher in T3-4 than in T1-2 (P = 0.008), and higher in Gleason score > 7 than ≤ 7 (P = 0.015). In addition, the DFS-related prognostic model was constructed based on the 22 ARGs (ULK2, NLRC4, MAPK1, ATG4D, MAPK3, ATG2A, ATG9B, FOXO1, PTEN, HDAC6, PRKN, HSPB8, P4HB, MAP2K7, MTOR, RHEB, TSC1, BIRC5, RGS19, RAB24, PTK6, and NRG2), with AUC of 0.85 (HR = 7.407, 95% CI = 4.850-11.320, P < 0.001), which were firmly related to T status (P < 0.001), N status (P = 0.001), and Gleason score (P < 0.001).

Overall 893 patients with Grade Group 4 disease at biopsy were identified and 726 patients were available for analysis. Multivariable logistic regression models were fit to determine factors associated with downgrading to Grade Group 3 or less at radical prostatectomy.  Results:   Overall 333 (45%) cases were downgraded to Grade Group 3 or less at radical prostatectomy. Of these cases 198 (27%) had concordant Grade Group 4 biopsy and radical prostatectomy pathology and 195 (27%) were upgraded at radical prostatectomy to Grade Group 5. Of high risk cases with biopsy Grade Group 4 disease 49% had any downgrading vs 29% of very high risk cases (p <0.0001). Downgrading to Grade Group 2 or less occurred in 16% (98 of 604) of high risk and 7% (8 of 122) of very high risk cases (p <0.01). Downgraded cases had a lower prostate specific antigen, fewer positive biopsy cores and lower clinical stage (p <0.01).

We determined the pathological and oncologic outcomes of favorable risk, Grade Group 1, prostate cancer managed with active surveillance and progressing to radical prostatectomy for clinically significant prostate cancer (Grade Group 2 or greater).  Materials and methods:   Between 1992 and 2015, 170 men with favorable risk prostate cancer underwent delayed radical prostatectomy for clinically significant prostate cancer (ASRP) at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre. Pathological and oncologic outcomes of the ASRP cohort were compared with a matched cohort treated with up-front radical prostatectomy (405) immediately before surgery. Biochemical recurrence-free survival, overall survival and cancer specific survival were compared. We examined the association between delayed radical prostatectomy and adverse pathology at radical prostatectomy and biochemical recurrence using logistic and Cox regression analyses, respectively.  Results:   Median time spent on active surveillance before radical prostatectomy was 31.0 months. At radical prostatectomy pT3 (extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion), positive surgical margin and pN1 rates were comparable between the 2 cohorts. Median followup after radical prostatectomy was 5.6 years. The 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rate in the ASRP cohort and up-front radical prostatectomy cohort were 85.8% and 82.4%, respectively (p=0.38). Overall survival and cancer specific survival were comparable between the 2 groups. Delayed radical prostatectomy was not associated with adverse pathological outcomes and biochemical recurrence on regression analyses.  Conclusions:   Curative intent radical prostatectomy after a period of active surveillance results in excellent pathological and oncologic outcomes at 5 years. A period of active surveillance does not result in inferior outcomes compared to patients with similar risk characteristics undergoing up-front radical prostatectomy.""","""['Ardalan E Ahmad', 'Patrick O Richard', 'Ricardo Leão', 'Mohammad Hajiha', 'Lisa J Martin', 'Maria Komisarenko', 'Ruby Grewal', 'Hanan Goldberg', 'Sepehr Salem', 'Kunal Jain', 'Ava Oliaei', 'Ivan Horyn', 'Narhari Timilshina', 'Alexandre Zlotta', 'Robert Hamilton', 'Girish Kulkarni', 'Neil Fleshner', 'Shabbir M H Alibhaic', 'Antonio Finelli']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Pathological, oncologic and functional outcomes of radical prostatectomy following active surveillance.', 'Comparison of Pathological and Oncologic Outcomes of Favorable Risk Gleason Score 3 + 4 and Low Risk Gleason Score 6 Prostate Cancer: Considerations for Active Surveillance.', 'Long-Term Outcomes after Deferred Radical Prostatectomy in Men Initially Treated with Active Surveillance.', 'Timing of curative treatment for prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Active surveillance versus radical treatment for favorable-risk localized prostate cancer.', 'Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on prostate cancer outcomes at an uro-oncology referral center.', 'Influence of Active Surveillance on Gleason Score Upgrade and Prognosis in Low- and Favorable Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Long-term and pathological outcomes of low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy: implications for active surveillance.']"""

Stapf oil demonstrates many therapeutic properties including anticancer properties. However, the effects of citral on suppressing human prostate cancer and its underlying molecular mechanism have yet to be elucidated. The citral was isolated from lemongrass oil using various spectroscopic analyses, such as electron ionized mass spectrometry (EI-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy respectively. We carried out 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay to evaluate the cell viability of citral in prostate cancer cells (PC-3 and PC3M). Furthermore, to confirm that PC3 undergoes apoptosis by inhibiting lipogenesis, we used several detection methods including flow cytometry, DNA fragmentation, Hoechst staining, PI staining, oil staining, qPCR, and Western blotting. Citral impaired the clonogenic property of the cancer cells and altered the morphology of cancer cells. Molecular interaction studies and the PASS biological program predicted that citral isomers tend to interact with proteins involved in lipogenesis and the apoptosis pathway. Furthermore, citral suppressed lipogenesis of prostate cancer cells through the activation of AMPK phosphorylation and downregulation of fatty acid synthase (FASN), acetyl coA carboxylase (ACC), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP1) and apoptosis of PC3 cells by upregulating BAX and downregulating Bcl-2 expression. In addition, in silico studies such as ADMET predicted that citral can be used as a safe potent drug for the treatment of prostate cancer. Our results indicate that citral may serve as a potential candidate against human prostate cancer and warrants in vivo studies.""","""['Sri Renukadevi Balusamy', 'Haribalan Perumalsamy', 'Karpagam Veerappan', 'Md Amdadul Huq', 'S Rajeshkumar', 'T Lakshmi', 'Yeon Ju Kim']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Biomed Res Int""","""['Inhibition of lipogenesis and induction of apoptosis by valproic acid in prostate cancer cells via the C/EBPα/SREBP-1 pathway.', 'Anti-proliferative activity of Origanum vulgare inhibited lipogenesis and induced mitochondrial mediated apoptosis in human stomach cancer cell lines.', 'Integrated transcriptome and in vitro analysis revealed anti-proliferative effect of citral in human stomach cancer through apoptosis.', 'Chemical Properties and Therapeutic Potential of Citral, a Monoterpene Isolated from Lemongrass.', 'Androgens, lipogenesis and prostate cancer.', 'Effect of brushing simulation on the surface roughness of soft-tissue liners: An in vitro study.', 'Research Trend and Detailed Insights into the Molecular Mechanisms of Food Bioactive Compounds against Cancer: A Comprehensive Review with Special Emphasis on Probiotics.', 'Orlistat Resensitizes Sorafenib-Resistance in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells through Modulating Metabolism.', 'Nanoemulsion and Encapsulation Strategy of Hydrophobic Oregano Essential Oil Increased Human Prostate Cancer Cell Death via Apoptosis by Attenuating Lipid Metabolism.', 'A Narrative Review of the Antitumor Activity of Monoterpenes from Essential Oils: An Update.']"""

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors have been identified as potential agents that could improve treatment outcomes and have demonstrated ability to increase the radiosensitivity of many human carcinomas. This retrospective human study aims to investigate the ability of COX-2 inhibitors, celecoxib, and meloxicam, to improve treatment outcomes after radiotherapy.  Methods:   Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) data of eligible patients were obtained from Genesis Cancer Care, Southport, Australia. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients in each group that had reached biochemical relapse at two and five years after treatment. Secondary outcomes included time to biochemical relapse and PSA velocity.  Results:   At two and five years after treatment, both the celecoxib (6.7%, 18.3%) and meloxicam (0.0%, 18.9%) showed lower relapse rates than the control (8.6%, 31.0%). Although not statistically significant, these results are clinically significant. In addition, the two treatment groups were found to increase the time to relapse, 46.20 months for celecoxib and 54.15 months for meloxicam, compared with the control group, 35.53 months. A similar trend was shown for PSA velocity with both treatment groups demonstrating lower PSA velocities compared with control.  Conclusions:   This study provides further evidence to the potential for COX-2 inhibitors to address gaps in localizedz PCa treatment by demonstrating high clinical significance for the use of celecoxib and meloxicam. Further research should be conducted including larger retrospective studies and prospective studies to fully evaluate the benefits of COX-2 inhibitors in combination with radiotherapy for PCa.""","""['Liam King', 'David Christie', 'Devinder Arora', 'Shailendra Anoopkumar-Dukie']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate Int""","""['A pilot study of use of the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor celecoxib in recurrent prostate cancer after definitive radiation therapy or radical prostatectomy.', 'Phase II trial of celecoxib in prostate-specific antigen recurrent prostate cancer after definitive radiation therapy or radical prostatectomy.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Cyclooxygenase-2 selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (etodolac, meloxicam, celecoxib, rofecoxib, etoricoxib, valdecoxib and lumiracoxib) for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic review and economic evaluation.', 'Tolerability of selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors used for the treatment of rheumatological manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease.', 'Based on network pharmacology and molecular docking to predict the mechanism of Huangqi in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A Mini-Review of Flavone Isomers Apigenin and Genistein in Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Expanding armamentarium in advanced prostate cancer management: are all novel antiandrogens the same?', 'Chemopreventive Potential of Caryophyllane Sesquiterpenes: An Overview of Preliminary Evidence.']"""

Although chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, and androgen deprivation therapy are applied, these therapies do not cure metastatic prostate cancer. Patients treated by androgen deprivation often develop castration resistant prostate cancer which is incurable. Novel approaches of treatment are clearly necessary. We have previously shown that prostate cancer originates as a stem cell disease. A prostate cancer patient sample, #87, obtained from prostatectomy surgery, was collected and frozen as single cell suspension. Cancer stem cell cultures were grown, single cell-cloned, and shown to be tumorigenic in SCID mice. However, outside its natural niche, the cultured prostate cancer stem cells lost their tumor-inducing capability and stem cell marker expression after approximately 8 transfers at a 1:3 split ratio. Tumor-inducing activity could be restored by inducing the cells to pluripotency using the method of Yamanaka. Cultures of human prostate-derived normal epithelial cells acquired from commercial sources were similarly induced to pluripotency and these did not acquire a tumor phenotype in vivo. To characterize the iPS87 cell line, cells were stained with antibodies to various markers of stem cells including: ALDH7A1, LGR5, Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, Androgen Receptor, and Retinoid X Receptor. These markers were found to be expressed by iPS87 cells, and the high tumorigenicity in SCID mice of iPS87 was confirmed by histopathology. This research thus characterizes the iPS87 cell line as a cancer-inducing, stem cell-like cell line, which can be used in the development of novel treatments for prostate cancer.""","""['Erika N Assoun', 'April N Meyer', 'Maggie Y Jiang', 'Stephen M Baird', 'Martin Haas', 'Daniel J Donoghue']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['Characterization of FGFR signaling in prostate cancer stem cells and inhibition via TKI treatment.', 'Enrichment of putative prostate cancer stem cells after androgen deprivation: upregulation of pluripotency transactivators concurs with resistance to androgen deprivation in LNCaP cell lines.', 'A rare castration-resistant progenitor cell population is highly enriched in Pten-null prostate tumours.', 'P450-dependent enzymes as targets for prostate cancer therapy.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Preclinical and Clinical Research Models of Prostate Cancer: A Brief Overview.', 'The Multifaceted Role of Aldehyde Dehydrogenases in Prostate Cancer Stem Cells.', 'FGFR1, a novel biomarker for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer?', 'Characterization of FGFR signaling in prostate cancer stem cells and inhibition via TKI treatment.']"""

These proteins contain a TUDOR domain binding H3K36me3, two PHD domains and a ""Winged-helix"" domain involved in GC-rich DNA binding. The human PCL3 locus encodes the full-length hPCL3L protein and a shorter isoform, hPCL3S containing the TUDOR and PHD1 domains only. In this study, we demonstrated by RT-qPCR analyses of 25 prostate tumors that hPCL3S is frequently up-regulated. In addition, hPCL3S is overexpressed in the androgen-independent DU145 and PC3 cells, but not in the androgen-dependent LNCaP cells. hPCL3S knockdown decreased the proliferation and migration of DU145 and PC3 whereas its forced expression into LNCaP increased these properties. A mutant hPCL3S unable to bind H3K36me3 (TUDOR-W50A) increased proliferation and migration of LNCaP similarly to wt hPCL3S whereas inactivation of its PHD1 domain decreased proliferation. These effects partially relied on the up-regulation of genes known to be important for the proliferation and/or migration of prostate cancer cells such as S100A16, PlexinA2, and Spondin1.

Sirtuins (SIRTs) are a family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent protein deacetylases, comprising seven members (SIRT1, SIRT2, SIRT3, SIRT4, SIRT5, SIRT6 and SIRT7). Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that SIRTs act as prognostic estimators in certain types of cancer such as lung cancer, prostate cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer and colorectal cancer. However, it remains unknown whether individual SIRTs can serve as independent prognostic factors in OC. In the present study, the Kaplan-Meier plotter online database was utilized to examine the prognostic values of SIRT mRNA expression in patients with OC. The results demonstrated that the overexpression of SIRT3, SIRT5, SIRT6 and SIRT7 mRNAs was associated with a good prognosis in patients, whereas elevated mRNA levels of SIRT1 and SIRT4 indicated poor survival in patients with OC. In addition, among the favorable predictors, SIRT3, SIRT5, SIRT6 and SIRT7 overexpression were associated with overall survival (OS), according to clinical characteristics, such as histological classification, clinical stage, pathology grade, drug therapy and tumor protein p53 mutation status in patients with OC. Similarly, SIRT4 mRNA overexpression was associated with poor OS in pathological grade III cancer. High SIRT1 and SIRT4 expression were associated with unfavorable OS at all clinical stages. Furthermore, SIRT1 and SIRT4 were negatively associated with OS in drug-treated patients. In summary, the present study demonstrated that the SIRT family is associated with the prognosis of human OC, suggesting that individual SIRTs may also act as prognostic predictors in patients.""","""['Qikuan He', 'Kai Chen', 'Ruifan Ye', 'Ninggao Dai', 'Pengyi Guo', 'Leixi Wang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Oncol Lett""","""['Association of sirtuins with clinicopathological parameters and overall survival in gastric cancer.', 'Prognostic value of sirtuin family members and experimental verification identify SIRT5 as diagnostic biomarkers in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'Gene expression and prognosis of sirtuin family members in ovarian cancer.', 'Sirtuins, Cell Senescence, and Vascular Aging.', 'Distinctive Roles of Sirtuins on Diabetes, Protective or Detrimental?', 'Emerging Roles of SIRT5 in Metabolism, Cancer, and SARS-CoV-2 Infection.', 'Potential of histone deacetylase inhibitors for the therapy of ovarian cancer.', ""Virtual Screening in the Identification of Sirtuins' Activity Modulators."", 'Therapeutic Potential and Activity Modulation of the Protein Lysine Deacylase Sirtuin 5.', 'Resveratrol Analog 4-Bromo-Resveratrol Inhibits Gastric Cancer Stemness through the SIRT3-c-Jun N-Terminal Kinase Signaling Pathway.']"""

Materials and methods:   The therapeutic effect of PDT with Laserphyrin® or L-HVJ-E was evaluated in the human prostate cancer cell line PC-3 in vitro. The subcellular localizations of Laserphyrin® and L-HVJ-E were observed by confocal microscopy. Apoptosis or necrosis following PDT was detected by annexin V-fluorescein/propidium iodide double staining.  Results:   The cytotoxic effect of Laserphyrin®- and L-HVJ-E-mediated PDT were determined by evaluating cell survival rate and production of reactive oxygen species. The cytotoxicity of L-HVJ-E-mediated PDT was dependent on drug concentration and light dose. Laserphyrin® and L-HVJ-E gradually entered cells as incubation time increased, and both agents tended to be distributed in lysosomes rather than mitochondria. Time and dose dependent increase in ROS production was observed, and induction of both apoptotic and necrotic cell death was confirmed.  Conclusions:   Laserphyrin® and L-HVJ-E were distributed mainly in lysosomes and induced cell death by both apoptosis and necrosis.

Overtreatment represents a major problem in prostate cancer therapy, leading to significant long-term quality-of-life effects for patients and a broad socio-ecological burden. Biomarkers that could facilitate risk stratification of prostate cancer aggressiveness at the time of diagnosis may help to guide clinical treatment decisions and reduce overtreatment. Previous research on genetic variations in prostate cancer has shown that germline copy number variations as well as somatic copy number alterations are commonly present in cancer patients, altering a greater portion of the cancer genome than any other type of genetic variation. To investigate the effect of germline copy number variations on cancer aggressiveness we have compared genome-wide screening data from genomic DNA isolated from the blood of 120 patients with aggressive prostate cancer, 231 patients with non-aggressive prostate cancer and 87 controls with benign prostatic hyperplasia from the Prostate Cancer Study of Austria biobank using the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array. We could show that patients with an aggressive form of prostate cancer had a higher frequency of copy number variations [mean count of copy number segments (CNS) = 12.9, median count of CNS = 9] compared to patients with non-aggressive prostate cancer (mean count of CNS = 10.4, median count of CNS = 8) or control patients diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia (mean count of CNS = 9.3, median count of CNS = 8). In general, we observed that copy number gain is a rarer event, compared to copy number loss within all three patient groups. Furthermore, we could show a significant effect of copy number losses located on chromosomes 8, 9 and 10 on prostate cancer aggressiveness (P = 0.040, P = 0.037 and P = 0.005, respectively). Applying a cross-validation analysis yielded an area under the curve of 0.63. Our study reports promising findings suggesting that copy number losses might play an important role in the establishment of novel biomarkers to predict prostate cancer aggressiveness at the time of diagnosis. Such markers could be used to facilitate risk stratification to reduce overtreatment of prostate cancer patients.""","""['Stefanie Brezina', 'Moritz Feigl', 'Tanja Gumpenberger', 'Ricarda Staudinger', 'Andreas Baierl', 'Andrea Gsur']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mutagenesis""","""['Genome-wide copy number analysis reveals candidate gene loci that confer susceptibility to high-grade prostate cancer.', 'Genome-wide copy-number variation analysis identifies common genetic variants at 20p13 associated with aggressiveness of prostate cancer.', 'Copy number alterations in prostate tumors and disease aggressiveness.', 'Prostate cancer: germline prediction for a commonly variable malignancy.', 'Prostate Cancer Germline Variations and Implications for Screening and Treatment.']"""

The aim of this study was to analyze the relationships between PV and age, total and free prostate specific antigen (tPSA, fPSA) and fPSA/tPSA ratio in patients without histologically proven prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   A retrospective analysis was made of the data of 1334 patients who underwent transrectal ultra- sound (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy between January 2016 and October 2018. A total of 438 patients with available data for age, tPSA and fPSA levels and PV calculated by TRUS were enrolled in the study. Patients with chronic prostatitis pathology in addition to BPH were also noted and evaluated as a separate group.  Results:   There were significant correlations between PV and age, tPSA, fPSA, fPSA/tPSA ratio (r = 0.210, r = 0.338, r = 0.548, r = 0.363 respectively). In multivariate linear regression analysis, fPSA was found to be the only predictor for PV (p < 0.001) when compared to age (p = 0.097), tPSA (p = 0.979) and fPSA/tPSA ratio (p = 0.425).

Materials and Methods: In this analysis of our prospectively maintained HIFU (Sonablate® 500) database, 598 patients were identified who underwent a focal HIFU (Sonablate 500) between March 2007 and November 2016. Follow-up occurred with 3-monthly clinic visits and prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing in the first year. Thereafter, PSA was measured 6-monthly or annually at least. Routine and for-cause multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) was conducted with biopsy for MRI suspicion of recurrence. Treatments were delivered in a quadrant or hemiablation fashion depending on the gland volume as well as tumor volume and location. Before mid-2015, standard focal HIFU was used (two HIFU blocks); after this date, some urologists conducted dose escalation focal HIFU (three overlapping HIFU blocks). Propensity matching was used to ensure two matched groups, leading to 162 cases for this analysis. Treatment failure was defined by any secondary treatment (systemic therapy, cryotherapy, radiotherapy, prostatectomy, or further HIFU), metastasis from prostate cancer without further treatment, tumor recurrence with Gleason score ≥7 (≥3 + 4) on prostate biopsy without further treatment, or prostate cancer-related mortality. Complications and side-effects were also compared. Results: Median age was 64.5 years (interquartile range [IQR] 60-73.5) in the standard focal-HIFU group and 64.5 years (IQR 60-69) in the dose-escalation group. Median prostate volume was 37 mL (IQR 17-103) in the standard group and 47.5 mL (IQR 19-121) in the dose-escalation group. As tumor volume on mpMRI and Gleason score were major matching criteria, these were identical with 0.43 mL (IQR 0.05-2.5) and Gleason 3 + 3 = 6 in 1 out of 32 (3%), 3 + 4 = 7 in 27 out of 32 (84%), and 4 + 3 = 7 in 4 out of 32 (13%). Recurrence in treated areas was found in 10 out of 32 (31%) when standard treatment zones were applied, and in 6 out of 32 (19%) of dose-escalation focal HIFU (p = 0.007).

These centers must fulfill the same requirements as their German counterparts. The article reports on the experiences of the first nine certified PCCoG, with a focus on their indicator results.  Method:   Following a descriptive analysis about primary case distribution, indicator definitions, and patient numbers, we compared indicator results for all 114 German PCC with all 9 PCCoG that have been certified for at least 3 years. Median centers' proportion was calculated and overall proportion for every indicator. Two-sided Cochran-Armitage tests were applied to detect trends over time.  Results:   The number of primary cases increased for both groups steadily from 2015 to 2017 as did fulfillment of most other indicators including PCa guideline-derived indicators. Requirements that proved to be hard to fulfill for PCCoG initially included psycho-oncological services (POS) and social service counselling (SCC). Fulfillment of POS requirements improved in the following years after initial certification in PCCoG. SCC rates remain low in PCCoG due to the different health system structures.  Conclusion:   Acquiring a certificate by the DKG is achievable for PCCoG. Candidate centers need to be aware that substantial effort is required to fulfill the criteria, but once this is done, typically an improvement of indicators and an increase in patient numbers can be observed. Different health-care systems need to be taken into consideration and the certification requirements adapted in different areas to allow country-specific implementation.""","""['Ellen Griesshammer', 'Henning Adam', 'Nora Tabea Sibert', 'Simone Wesselmann']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Quality assessment in prostate cancer centers certified by the German Cancer Society.', 'Documented quality of care in certified colorectal cancer centers in Germany: German Cancer Society benchmarking report for 2013.', 'Quality of care in breast cancer centers: results of benchmarking by the German Cancer Society and German Society for Breast Diseases.', 'Multidisciplinary breast centres in Germany: a review and update of quality assurance through benchmarking and certification.', 'The concept of the certification system of the German Cancer Society and its impact on gynecological cancer care.', 'Suboptimal use of hormonal therapy among German men with localized high-risk prostate Cancer during 2005 to 2015: analysis of registry data.', 'Is treatment in certified cancer centers related to better survival in patients with pancreatic cancer?

Propensity-score (PS) matching, Kaplan-Meier plots and multivariable Cox-regression models (CRMs) were used.  Results:   Overall, 585 (8.6%) patients harboured pRCC. Rates of nodal metastases were higher in patients with pRCC (49.7 vs. 23.3%; p < 0.001). Median overall survival (OS) was 13 vs. 18 months for pRCC vs. ccRCC patients. After multivariable adjustments, no difference in OS was recorded. Furthermore, after propensity-score matching, virtually the same results were recorded. Median OS of pRCC vs. ccRCC was 8 vs. 4 months for no treatment (NT), 11 vs. 12 months for targeted therapy alone (TT), 17 vs. 35 months for cytoreductive nephrectomy alone (CN) and 18 vs. 25 months for combination of CN with TT.  Conclusions:   Metastatic pRCC patients exhibit poor survival, regardless of treatment received.

Roles of SLC6A1 deregulation in prostate carcinogenesis and drug resistance was further determined in vitro and in vivo experiments.  Results:   Based on TCGA Dataset, SLC6A1 expression was markedly higher in patients with high Gleason score, advanced clinical stage and positive biochemical recurrence than those with control features (all P < 0.05). Both unvariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that SLC6A1 expression was significantly associated with biochemical recurrence-free survival in PCa patients. In addition, enforced expression of SLC6A1 effectively promoted cell proliferation, migration and invasion of PCa cells in vitro. Moreover, the inhibition of SLC6A1 suppressed the tumor growth in vivo. Additionally, immunohistochemical notches of PCNA and MMP-9 in the low-expression cluster were pointedly lower compared to those of NC group. Finally, the cell viability revealed that the overexpression of SLC6A1 obviously promoted the PCa cell resistant to docetaxel (DTX), and the transplanted tumor in the overexpression group had no significant reduction compared with the untreated group.  Conclusions:   Our data suggest that SLC6A1 overexpression may be associated with aggressive progression and short biochemical recurrence-free survival of PCa, and may be related to the resistance to docetaxel therapy.""","""['Chaojiang Chen', 'Zhiduan Cai', 'Yangjia Zhuo', 'Ming Xi', 'Zhuoyuan Lin', 'Funeng Jiang', 'Zezhen Liu', 'Yueping Wan', 'Yu Zheng', 'Jianxin Li', 'Xing Zhou', 'Jianguo Zhu', 'Weide Zhong']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Overexpression of claspin promotes docetaxel resistance and is associated with prostate-specific antigen recurrence in prostate cancer.', 'MiR-200c-3p inhibits cell migration and invasion of clear cell renal cell carcinoma via regulating SLC6A1.', 'miR-375 induces docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer by targeting SEC23A and YAP1.', 'The disruption of protein-protein interactions as a therapeutic strategy for prostate cancer.', 'Overcoming drug resistance and treating advanced prostate cancer.', 'Development and validation of a prognostic model for mitophagy-related genes in colon adenocarcinoma: A study based on TCGA and GEO databases.', 'A novel risk score model based on gamma-aminobutyric acid signature predicts the survival prognosis of patients with breast cancer.', 'A draft conceptual model of SLC6A1 neurodevelopmental disorder.', 'Establishment of a five-enzalutamide-resistance-related-gene-based classifier for recurrence-free survival predicting of prostate cancer.', 'Integrated Analysis of DNA Repair Genes Identifies SLC6A1 as a New Marker for the Clinical Outcome of Patients with Colorectal Cancer.']"""

This can be done by computing a Regulatory Impact Factor (RIF) score for relevant regulators. However, this computation is based on estimating correlated patterns of gene expression, often Pearson correlation, and an assumption about a set of specific regulators, normally transcription factors. This study explores alternative measures of correlation, using the Fisher and Sobolev metrics, and an extended set of regulators, including epigenetic regulators and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Data on prostate cancer have been used to explore the effect of these modifications.  Results:   A tool for computation of RIF scores with alternative correlation measures and extended sets of regulators was developed and tested on gene expression data for prostate cancer. The study showed that the Fisher and Sobolev metrics lead to improved identification of well-documented regulators of gene expression in prostate cancer, and the sets of identified key regulators showed improved overlap with previously defined gene sets of relevance to cancer. The extended set of regulators lead to identification of several interesting candidates for further studies, including lncRNAs. Several key processes were identified as important, including spindle assembly and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).  Conclusions:   The study has shown that using alternative metrics of correlation can improve the performance of tools based on correlation of gene expression in genomic data.

In contrast to homomeric Orai1 channels, they exhibit a different pharmacology upon application of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) in various cell types. In endogenous cells, subunit composition and arrangement may vary and cannot be defined precisely. In this study, we used patch-clamp electrophysiology to investigate the 2-APB profile of store-operated and store-independent homomeric Orai1 and heteromeric Orai1/Orai3 concatenated channels with defined subunit compositions. As has been shown previous, one or more Orai3 subunit(s) within the channel result(s) in decreased Ca2+ release activated Ca2+ current (ICRAC). Upon application of 50 µM 2-APB, channels with two or more Orai3 subunits exhibit large outward currents and can be activated by 2-APB independent from storedepletion and/or the presence of STIM1. The number and position of Orai3 subunits within the heteromeric store-operated channel change ion conductivity of 2-APB-activated outward current. Compared to homomeric Orai1 channels, one Orai3 subunit within the channel does not alter 2-APB pharmacology. None of the concatenated channel constructs were able to exactly simulate the complex 2-APB pharmacology observed in prostate cancer cells. However, 2-APB profiles of prostate cancer cells are similar to those of concatenated channels with Orai3 subunit(s). Considering the presented and previous results, this indicates that distinct subtypes of heteromeric SOCE channels may be selectively activated or blocked. In the future, targeting distinct heteromeric SOCE channel subtypes may be the key to tailored SOCE-based therapies.""","""['Sven Kappel', 'Tatiana Kilch', 'Roland Baur', 'Martin Lochner', 'Christine Peinelt']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Store-Independent Orai Channels Regulated by STIM.', 'Facilitation of Orai3 targeting and store-operated function by Orai1.', 'Competitive modulation of Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ channel gating by STIM1 and 2-aminoethyldiphenyl borate.', 'Pharmacology of Store-Operated Calcium Entry Channels.', 'Complex actions of 2-aminoethyldiphenyl borate on store-operated calcium entry.', 'ORAI Calcium Channels: Regulation, Function, Pharmacology, and Therapeutic Targets.', 'Orai3 Regulates Pancreatic Cancer Metastasis by Encoding a Functional Store Operated Calcium Entry Channel.', 'Isoform-Specific Properties of Orai Homologues in Activation, Downstream Signaling, Physiology and Pathophysiology.', 'Development of Store-Operated Calcium Entry-Targeted Compounds in Cancer.', 'Orai3-Mediates Cisplatin-Resistance in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells by Enriching Cancer Stem Cell Population through PI3K/AKT Pathway.']"""

To enable prolonged circulation and selective cellular internalization, P(DSP-Gu) is complexed with anisamide-end-capped poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(l-phosphotyrosine)-block-poly(l-leucine) (AA-PEG-PpY-PLeu) to yield Tg-PIC via electrostatic coacervation.

Gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) distributed in the vicinity of 103Pd radioactive implants, strongly enhance the therapeutic dose of radioactive implants (radiosensitisation effect). A new strategy under development to replace millimetre-size implants, consist in injecting radioactive NPs in the affected tissues. The development of 103Pd@Au NPs distributed in the diseased tissue, could increase the uniformity of treatment (compared with massive seeds), while enhancing the radiotherapeutic dose to the cancer cells (through Au-mediated radiosensitisation effect). To achieve this goal, it is necessary to develop a rapid, efficient, one-pot and easy-to-automatise procedure, allowing the synthesis of core-shell Pd@Au NPs. The novel synthesis route proposed here enables the production of Pd@Au NPs in not more than 4 h, in aqueous media, with minimal manipulations, and relying on biocompatible and non-toxic molecules. This rapid multi-step process consists of the preparation of ultra-small Pd NPs by chemical reduction of an aqueous solution of H2PdCl4 supplemented with ascorbic acid (AA) as reducing agent and 2,3-meso-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) as a capping agent. Pd conversion yields close to 87% were found, indicating the efficiency of the reaction process. Then Pd NPs were used as seeds for the growth of a gold shell (Pd@Au), followed by grafting with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to ensure colloidal stability. Pd@Au-PEG (TEM: 20.2 ± 12.1 nm) formed very stable colloids in saline solution as well as in cell culture medium. The physico-chemical properties of the particles were characterised by FTIR, XPS, and UV-vis. spectroscopies. The viability of PC3 human prostate cancer cells was not affected after a 24 h incubation cycle with Pd@Au-PEG NPs to concentrations up to 4.22 mM Au. Finally, suspensions of Pd@Au-PEG NPs measured in computed tomography (CT) are found to attenuate X-rays more efficiently than commercial Au NPs CT contrast media. A proof-of-concept was performed to demonstrate the possibility synthesise radioactive 103Pd:Pd@Au-PEG NPs. This study reveals the possibility to synthesise Pd@Au NPs rapidly (including radioactive 103Pd:Pd@Au-PEG NPs), and following a methodology that respects all the strict requirements underlying the production of NPs for radiotherapeutic use (rapidity, reaction yield, colloidal stability, NPs concentration, purification).""","""['D Djoumessi', 'M Laprise-Pelletier', 'P Chevallier', 'J Lagueux', 'M F Côté', 'M-A Fortin']""","""[]""","""2015""","""None""","""J Mater Chem B""","""['Low-Dose Prostate Cancer Brachytherapy with Radioactive Palladium-Gold Nanoparticles.', 'Intratumoral Injection of Low-Energy Photon-Emitting Gold Nanoparticles: A Microdosimetric Monte Carlo-Based Model.', 'Concentrated colloids of silica-encapsulated gold nanoparticles: colloidal stability, cytotoxicity, and X-ray absorption.', 'Multi-functional core-shell Fe3O4@Au nanoparticles for cancer diagnosis and therapy.', 'Gold, Silver, and Palladium Nanoparticles: A Chemical Tool for Biomedical Applications.', 'Synthesis, In Vitro Testing, and Biodistribution of Surfactant-Free Radioactive Nanoparticles for Cancer Treatment.']"""

Results:   The CPCC-RC's predictive ability for any PCa (AUC 0.77, 95% CI 0.75-0.79) was lower than the A-ERSPC-RC3 (AUC 0.79, 95% CI 0.77-0.81) in the European screening cohort (p < 0.001), but similar for HGPCa (p = 0.24). The CPCC-RC showed lower predictive accuracy for any PCa (AUC 0.65, 95% CI 0.61-0.70), but acceptable predictive accuracy for HGPCa (AUC 0.73, 95% CI 0.69-0.77) in the European clinical cohort. The A-ERSPC-RC3 showed an AUC of 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.76) in predicting any PCa, and a similar AUC of 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.76) in predicting HGPCa in Chinese cohort. In the Chinese population, decision curve analysis revealed a higher net benefit for CPCC-RC than A-ERSPC-RC3, while in the European screening and clinical cohorts, the net benefit was higher for A-ERSPC-RC3.  Conclusions:   The A-ERSPC-RC3 accurately predict the prostate biopsy in a contemporary Chinese multi-center clinical cohort. The CPCC-RC can predict accurately in a population-based screening cohort, but not in the European clinical cohort.""","""['Rui Chen#', 'Jan F M Verbeek#', 'Yue Yang', 'Zijian Song', 'Yinghao Sun', 'Monique J Roobol']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Prediction of High-grade Prostate Cancer Following Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Improving the Rotterdam European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer Risk Calculators.', 'Development and external multicenter validation of Chinese Prostate Cancer Consortium prostate cancer risk calculator for initial prostate biopsy.', 'Prediction of Prostate Cancer: External Validation of the ERSPC Risk Calculator in a Contemporary Dutch Clinical Cohort.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Do prostate cancer risk models improve the predictive accuracy of PSA screening?

Under simple synthetic conditions, the molecular scaffold of thiazole orange bridged with a terminal side-group (phenol or methoxybenzene) becomes more flexible because the newly added ethylene bridge is relatively less rigid than the methylene of thiazole orange. It was found that these molecules showed better selectivity towards G-quadruplex DNA structure in molecular interactions with different type of nucleic acids. The difference in terms of induced DNA-ligand interaction signal, selectivity, and binding affinity of the ligands with the representative nucleic acids including single-stranded DNA, double-stranded DNA, telomere and promoter G4-DNA and ribosomal RNA were investigated. The position of the terminal methoxyl groups was found showing strong influence both on binding affinity and fluorescent discrimination among 19 nucleic acids tested. The ligand with a methoxyl group substituted at the meta-position of the styryl moiety exhibited the best fluorescent recognition performance towards telo21 G4-DNA. A good linear relationship between the induced fluorescent binding signal and the concentration of telo21 was obtained. The comparison of ligand-DNA interaction properties including equilibrium binding constants, molecular docking, G4-conformation change and stabilization ability for G4-structures was also conducted. Two cancer cell lines (human prostate cancer cell (PC3) and human hepatoma cell (hepG2)) were selected to explore the inhibitory effect of the ligands on the cancer cell growth.

Patients and methods:   This retrospective study included 105 patients with mCRPC who were treated between April 2004 and May 2019. We divided the patients into 2 groups: patients treated with RT to the primary tumor after they developed CRPC (RT group) and without (non-RT group). The primary purpose was safety assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. The secondary purpose included prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS). Background-adjusted multivariate analyses, with the inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) method, were performed to evaluate impact of RT on CSS and OS.  Results:   The median age at CRPC diagnosis was 75 years, and the median follow-up period after CRPC diagnosis was 21 months. The adverse events rates related to RT in any grade and grade ≥ 3 were 55% and 23%, respectively. Nine (29%) patients achieved ≥ 30% PSA decline with RT. In multivariate analyses with the IPTW method, the CSS and OS in the RT group were significantly longer than those in the non-RT group. In subgroup analyses with the IPTW method, RT was significantly associated with improved OS in patients aged ≥ 75 years and patients with initial PSA ≥ 500 ng/mL, cT4, Gleason score ≥ 8, and high-volume metastatic burden.

We evaluated the prognostic value of epigenetic (HDAC1, HDAC4, H3Ac) and inflammation-related (CXCR4, CXCR7, CXCL12) biomarkers immunoexpression, in radical prostatectomy specimens, from 2 cohorts of CaP patients with long term follow-up.  Materials and methods:   Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded radical prostatectomy specimens were obtained from the pathology archives of Prof. Doutor Fernando Fonseca Hospital, in Amadora, Portugal and Portuguese Oncology Institute of Porto, in Porto, Portugal, and tissue microarrays were assembled. It was achieved a set of 234 patients submitted to radical retropubic prostatectomy between January 2000 and December 2005. Immunohistochemistry was used for evaluation of protein expression of epigenetic and inflammation-related markers. Nuclear staining was assessed using digital image analysis. Study outcomes included disease-specific survival and disease-free survival (DFS). Statistical analysis was tabulated using SPSS version 23.0. Hazard ratios (HRs) and survival curves were estimated using Cox-regression and Kaplan-Meyer models, respectively. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.  Results:   Complete follow-up data was available for 234 patients and median follow-up time was 164 [11-218] months. Patients with higher CXCR4 immunoexpression experienced significantly worse disease-specific survival compared to patients with low expression (HR = 1.016, 95% CI: 1.002-1.031). The same happened with CXCL12 (HR = 0.546 95% CI: 0.322-0.926) and H3Ac (HR = 1.015, 95% CI: 1.001c1.029). In what concerns to DFS, patients with higher expression of CXCR4 and CXCR7 were significantly more prone to experience disease recurrence (HR = 1.003, 95% CI: 1.000-1.005 and HR = 1.111, 95% CI:1.032-1.196, respectively). When adjusted to pTStage and WHO Grade Groups, CXCR7 maintained independent impact on DFS (HR = 1.119, 95% CI: 1.032-1.214).  Conclusions:   The interplay between inflammation and epigenetics and its impact in CaP outcome deserves further studies in the future.

Methods:   The study populations were derived from 2 multi-institutional observational studies. Between February 2009 and September 2014, AA and EA men who elected immediate radical prostatectomy after a ≥10-core transrectal ultrasound biopsy were included in the study. Logistic regressions, area under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUC), calibration curves, and predictive values were used to compare the accuracy of GPS. AP was defined as primary Gleason grade 4, presence of any Gleason pattern 5, and/or non-organ-confined disease (≥pT3aN0M0) at radical prostatectomy.  Results:   Overall, 96 AA and 76 EA men were selected and 46 (26.7%) had AP.

GPS remained significant in models adjusted for either National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group or Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score. In race-stratified models, area under the receiver operating characteristics curves for GPS/20 units was 0.69 for AAs vs 0.74 for EAs (P = .79).

TOP2 resolves the entanglement of genomic DNA by transiently generating double-strand breaks (DSBs), where TOP2 homodimers covalently bind to 5' DSB ends, called TOP2-DNA cleavage complexes (TOP2ccs). When TOP2 fails to rejoin TOP2ccs generating stalled TOP2ccs, tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase-2 (TDP2) removes 5' TOP2 adducts from stalled TOP2ccs prior to the ligation of the DSBs by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), the dominant DSB repair pathway in G0 /G1 phases. We previously showed that estrogens frequently generate stalled TOP2ccs in G0 /G1 phases. Here, we show that physiological concentrations of androgens induce several DSBs in individual human prostate cancer cells during G1 phase, and loss of TDP2 causes a five times higher number of androgen-induced chromosome breaks in mitotic chromosome spreads. Intraperitoneally injected androgens induce several DSBs in individual epithelial cells of the prostate in TDP2-deficient mice, even at 20 hr postinjection.

Therefore, the main purpose of the current research work was to study the anticancer effects of a naturally occurring coumarin- Auraptenol- against drug-resistant human prostate cancer cells and evaluate its effects on programmed cell death, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and JNK/p38 MAPK signalling pathway.  Methods:   Cell proliferation was examined by CCK8 cell viability assay. Apoptosis-related studies were checked by fluorescent microscopy using acridine orange (AO)/ethidium bromide (EB) and Hoechst staining, as well as flow cytometry using annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) assay. Western blot was used to study the effects of Auraptenol on apoptosis-related protein expressions including Bax, Bcl-2, as well as JNK/p38 MAPK signalling pathway. ROS production was evaluated by flow cytometry.  Results:   The results showed that Auraptenol caused significant reduction in the viability of the human LNCaP prostate carcinoma cells in a dose-dependent manner, exhibiting an IC50 of 25 µM in cancer cells and IC50 of 100 µM in normal PNT2 cells. The AO/EB staining assay showed that Auraptenol inhibited the viability of cancer cells via induction of apoptotic cell death, which was associated with increase in Bax and decrease in Bcl-2 levels. Hoechst staining results also confirmed that Auraptenol induced programmed cell death. The apoptotic cells increased from 0.8% in the control to 32.5% in the study group at 50 µM concentration of Auraptenol.

We examined these rates in urban-rural Appalachia and non-Appalachia Pennsylvania (PA), and the association between these areas and more aggressive prostate cancer at diagnosis.  Methods:   Men, ages ≥ 40 years with a primary prostate cancer diagnosis, were identified from the 2004-2014 Pennsylvania Cancer Registry. Age-adjusted incidence rates for prostate cancer and more aggressive prostate cancer at diagnosis were calculated by urban-rural Appalachia status. Multivariable Poisson regressions were conducted. Multiple logistic regressions were used to examine the association between the geographic areas and more aggressive prostate cancer, after adjusting for confounders.  Results:   There were 94,274 cases, ages 40-105 years, included. Urban non-Appalachia had the highest 2004-2014 age-adjusted incidence rates of prostate cancer and more aggressive prostate cancer (293.56 and 96.39 per 100,000 men, respectively) and rural Appalachia had the lowest rates (256.48 and 80.18 per 100,000 men, respectively). Among the cases, urban Appalachia were more likely [OR = 1.12; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.08-1.17] and rural Appalachia were less likely (OR = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.87-0.97) to have more aggressive prostate cancer at diagnosis compared with urban non-Appalachia.  Conclusions:   Lower incidence rates and the proportion of aggressive disease in rural Appalachia may be due to lower prostate cancer screening rates. More aggressive prostate cancer at diagnosis among the cases in urban Appalachia may be due to exposures that are prevalent in the region.

Methods:   Baldness was self-reported on the 1992 questionnaire using the modified Norwood-Hamilton scale prior to diagnosis. We estimated HRs between baldness and prostate cancer risk among 36,760 men, with follow-up through 2014. We also investigated whether baldness was associated with prostate cancer defined by tumor protein expression of androgen receptor and the presence of the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion.  Results:   During 22 years, 5,157 prostate cancer cases were identified. Fifty-six percent of the men had either frontal or vertex baldness. No significant associations were found between baldness and prostate cancer risk. Among men younger than 60 years, there was a statistically significant association between frontal and severe vertex baldness and overall prostate cancer (HR: 1.74; 95% confidence interval: 1.23-2.48). Baldness was not significantly associated with expression of molecular subtypes defined by AR and TMPRSS2:ERG IHC of prostate tumors.  Conclusions:   This study showed no association between baldness at age 45 and prostate cancer risk, overall or for clinical or molecular markers. The association between baldness and overall prostate cancer among younger men is intriguing, but caution is warranted when interpreting this finding.

Such studies often have a two-phase design, where information on expensive biomarkers are ascertained in a nested substudy of the original cohort.  Methods:   We propose a simple approach for evaluating model discrimination that accounts for incomplete follow-up and gains efficiency by using data from all individuals in the cohort irrespective of whether they were sampled in the substudy. For evaluating the AUC, we estimated probabilities of risk-scores for cases being larger than those in controls conditional on partial risk-scores, computed using partial covariate information. The proposed method was compared with an inverse probability weighted (IPW) approach that used information only from the subjects in the substudy. We evaluated age-stratified AUC of a model including questionnaire-based risk factors and inflammation biomarkers to predict 10-year risk of lung cancer using data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer (1993-2009) trial (30,297 ever-smokers, 1,253 patients with lung cancer).  Results:   For estimating age-stratified AUC of the combined lung cancer risk model, the proposed method was 3.8 to 5.3 times more efficient compared with the IPW approach across the different age groups. Extensive simulation studies also demonstrated substantial efficiency gain compared with the IPW approach.

We sought to investigate atlas based segmentation (ABS) in patients with early stage breast cancer status post breast conserving surgery treated with adjuvant radiation therapy in the prone position. An initial atlas library was generated by uploading 20 previously treated patients. Subsequently, a group of 20 consecutive patients underwent treatment planning. Heart, right lung, left lung, total lungs, and breast clinical target volume (CTV) targets were manually contoured per our standard workflow. ABS was then incorporated into our radiation planning workflow and differences in contouring time were recorded, including time needed for ABS volume refinement. ABS generated volumes were compared subjectively in the unedited and edited stages by an independent radiation oncologist to reduce bias by incorporating an interobserver quality analysis. Various objective measurements were used to compare target volume quality including mean distance to agreement (MDA), Dice Coefficient (DC), logit transformation of DC (logit(DC)). The contouring physician edited 88.75% of organ at risk (OAR) volumes on average per patient, whereas the independent reviewing physician recommended revision of 27.5% OAR on average volumes per patient. CTV editing was performed in 20/20 (100%) of cases by the contouring physician, whereas CTV revision was recommended by the independent reviewing physician in 4/20 (20%) of cases. Our atlas performed well with DC values of >0.909 and logit(DC) of >2.344 across heart, lung, and breast volumes when compared to manually generated volumes. All objective measurements demonstrated improvement with physician refinement of ABS generated volumes. The largest absolute improvement was seen in the heart and breast CTV targets. There was 100% acceptance of the edited ABS generated volumes by the independent reviewing physician. The average time saved using ABS was 6.27 minutes (56.92%) per patient.

Methods:   2683 patients treated with HDR or EBRT between 1994 and 2017 were included. HDR fractionation was 38 Gy/4 fractions (n = 321), 24 Gy/2 (n = 96), or 27 Gy/2 (n = 128). EBRT patients received a median dose of 75.6 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions [range 70.2-82.8 Gy], using either 3D conformal or intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). EBRT patients underwent 3D image guidance via an off-line adaptive process.  Results:   Median follow-up was 7.5 years (7.4 years for EBRT and 7.9 years for HDR). 545 patients (20.3%) received HDR brachytherapy and 2138 (79.7%) EBRT. 69.1% of EBRT patients received IMRT. Compared to EBRT, HDR was associated with decreased rates of acute grade ≥2 diarrhea (0.7% vs. 4.5%, p < 0.001), rectal pain/tenesmus (0.6% vs. 7.9%, p < 0.001), and rectal bleeding (0% vs. 1.6%, p = 0.001). Rates of chronic grade ≥2 rectal bleeding (1.3% vs. 8.7%, p < 0.001) and radiation proctitis (0.9% vs. 3.3%, p = 0.001) favored HDR over EBRT. Rates of any chronic rectal toxicity grade ≥2 were 2.4% vs. 10.5% (p < 0.001) for HDR versus EBRT, respectively. In those treated with IMRT, acute and chronic rates of any grade ≥2 GI toxicity were significantly reduced but remained significantly greater than those treated with HDR.

Unlike normal cells that utilize food-derived circulating lipids for their fuel, cancer cells rely on heightened lipogenesis irrespective of exogenous lipid availability. Overexpression and activity of the multidomain enzyme fatty acid synthase (FASN) is crucial in supplying palmitate for protumorigenic activity. Therefore, FASN has been proposed as an attractive target for drug development. As an effort to set up an effective toolkit to study FASN inhibitors in human and rodent tissues, we validated activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) as a viable approach to unveil inhibitors targeting FASN thioesterase domain (FASN-TE). ABPP was combined with multi-well plate-assays designed for classical substrate-based FASN activity analysis together with powerful monitoring of cancer cell proliferation using IncuCyte® Live Cell Analyzing System. FASN-TE inhibitors were identified by competitive ABPP using HEK293 cell lysates in a screen of in-house compounds (200+) designed to target serine hydrolase (SH) family. The identified compounds were tested for their inhibitor potencies in vitro using a substrate-based activity assay monitoring FASN-dependent NADPH consumption in LNCaP prostate cancer cell preparation, in parallel with selected reference inhibitors, including orlistat (THL), GSK2194069, GSK837149A, platensimycin and BI-99179. LNCaP lysate supernatant was validated as a reliable native preparation to monitor FASN-dependent NADPH consumption as opposed to human glioma GAMG cells, whereas FASN enrichment was a prerequisite for accurate assays. While inhibitor pharmacology was identical between human prostate and glioma cancer cell FASN preparations, notable differences were revealed between human and rodent FASN preparations, especially for inhibitors targeting FASN-TE. ABPP combined with substrate-based assays facilitated identification of pan thiol-reactive inhibitor scaffolds, exemplified by the 1,2,4-thiadiazole moiety. Finally, selected compounds were evaluated for their antiproliferative efficacy in situ using GAMG cells. These studies revealed that while the tested compounds acted as potent FASN inhibitors in vitro, only a few showed antiproliferative efficacy in situ. To conclude, we describe a versatile toolkit to study FASN inhibitors in vitro and in situ using human cancer cells and reveal dramatic pharmacological differences between human and rodent FASN preparations.""","""['Prosanta K Singha', 'Kiira Mäklin', 'Taina Vihavainen', 'Tuomo Laitinen', 'Tapio J Nevalainen', 'Mahadeo R Patil', 'Arun K Tonduru', 'Antti Poso', 'Jarmo T Laitinen', 'Juha R Savinainen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur J Pharm Sci""","""['Pharmacological inhibitors of Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN)--catalyzed endogenous fatty acid biogenesis: a new family of anti-cancer agents?', 'An Inhibitor of Fatty Acid Synthase Thioesterase Domain with Improved Cytotoxicity against Breast Cancer Cells and Stability in Plasma.', 'Development of a Self-Assembled Nanoparticle Formulation of Orlistat, Nano-ORL, with Increased Cytotoxicity against Human Tumor Cell Lines.', 'In silico screening for identification of fatty acid synthase inhibitors and evaluation of their antiproliferative activity using human cancer cell lines.', 'Targeting fatty acid synthase in breast and endometrial cancer: An alternative to selective estrogen receptor modulators?', 'High-throughput in situ perturbation of metabolite levels in the tumor micro-environment reveals favorable metabolic condition for increased fitness of infiltrated T-cells.', 'Enzyme-Responsive Peptide Thioesters for Targeting Golgi Apparatus.', 'Synthesis and Evaluation of 11C-Labeled Triazolones as Probes for Imaging Fatty Acid Synthase Expression by Positron Emission Tomography.', 'Lipogenesis inhibitors: therapeutic opportunities and challenges.']"""

Most of the informants stated that they applied a mechanism-based treatment and mainly prescribed low-dose methadone as an add-on to an existing opioid therapy to benefit from methadone´s proposed NMDA-receptor inhibiting properties, e.g. in cases with reduced opioid sensitivity. Despite its complex pharmacokinetics with a long half-life, most informants expressed defined strategies to avoid side-effects such as respiratory depression, especially when initiating treatment in the home-care setting. While many palliative care physicians expressed an overly enthusiastic attitude, others stressed the risks of overconfidence, low precision in use, and overlooked treatment options. Besides the obvious physical pain-relieving effects, they stated that effective pain relief could result in a reduced workload and emotional empowerment, both for physicians and staff.  Conclusion:   Methadone, especially in the form of low-dose add-on to other opioids is widely advocated in Swedish specialized palliative care as a practical and safe method with rapid onset in complex pain situations at the end of life.""","""['Per Fürst', 'Staffan Lundström', 'Peter Strang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['The Use of Low-Dose Methadone as Add-On to Ongoing Opioid Treatment in Palliative Cancer Care-An Underrated Treatment?', 'The Use of Low-Dose Methadone as Add-On to Regular Opioid Therapy in Cancer-Related Pain at End of Life: A National Swedish Survey in Specialized Palliative Care.', 'Practices, Attitudes, and Beliefs of Palliative Care Physicians Regarding the Use of Methadone and Other Long-Acting Opioids in Children with Advanced Cancer.', 'Attitudes, Beliefs, and Practices of Pediatric Palliative Care Physicians Regarding the Use of Methadone in Children With Advanced Cancer.', 'Palliative Treatment of Cancer-Related Pain Internet.', 'The Use of Low-Dose Methadone as Add-On to Ongoing Opioid Treatment in Palliative Cancer Care-An Underrated Treatment?', 'Continuous subcutaneous infusion for pain control in dying patients: experiences from a tertiary palliative care center.']"""

DDR1-targeted therapy with siRNA might be a promising strategy for EMT inhibition. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of DDR1 knockdown in the EMT, migration, and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. For this purpose, the expression of DDR1 was down regulated by the siRNA approach in LNcap-FGC and DU-145 prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   Immunocytochemistry was carried out for the assessment of EMT. E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Bax, Bcl2, and the phosphorylation level of Proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) and Map Kinase Kinase 7 (MKK7) was determined using the western blot. Wound healing assay was used to evaluate cell migration. Flow cytometry was employed to determine the apoptosis rate in siRNA-transfected cancer cells.  Results:   Our findings showed that the stimulation of DDR1 with collagen-I caused increased phosphorylation of Pyk2 and MKK7 signaling molecules that led to the induction of EMT and migration in DU-145 and LNcap- FGC cells. In contrast, DDR1 knockdown led to significant attenuation of EMT, migration, and phosphorylation levels of Pyk2 and MKK7. Moreover, DDR1 knockdown via induction of Bax expression and suppression of Bcl-2 expression induces apoptosis.  Conclusion:   Collectively, our results indicate that the DDR1 targeting with siRNA may be beneficial for the inhibition of EMT and the induction of apoptosis in prostate cancer.""","""['Reza Azizi', 'Faranak Fallahian', 'Mahmoud Aghaei', 'Zahra Salemi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Anticancer Agents Med Chem""","""['Inhibition of didscoidin domain receptor 1 reduces epithelial-mesenchymal transition and induce cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Integrin α2β1 inhibition attenuates prostate cancer cell proliferation by cell cycle arrest, promoting apoptosis and reducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'Up-regulation of N-cadherin by Collagen I-activated Discoidin Domain Receptor 1 in Pancreatic Cancer Requires the Adaptor Molecule Shc1.', 'Signaling by discoidin domain receptor 1 in cancer metastasis.', 'A patent review of discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) modulators (2014-present).', 'Genetic and pharmacological tools to study the role of discoidin domain receptors in kidney disease.', 'Discoidin domain receptors orchestrate cancer progression: A focus on cancer therapies.']"""

Here, we first demonstrate an aptamer-based frequency shift Raman approach via sensing of graphene. This biosensor allows the rapid, sensitive, and label-free detection of the acknowledged protein cancer biomarker, prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Monolayer graphene is employed as the Raman substrate, which is highly sensitive to its electronic structure and interface properties. The PSA aptamer can be adsorbed strongly on the surface of substrates through π-π stacking interactions. The vibrational frequency of the G peak of graphene shifted upon the specific binding between the PSA and its aptamer. The corresponding frequency shifts of the G peak are directly correlated with PSA concentrations. The limit of detection is as low as 0.01 ng/mL, with a wide linear range from 0.05 ng/mL to 25 ng/mL. The analytic samples can be detected directly without any extensive preparation and label process. The whole detection is completed in only 30 min.

Long noncoding RNA Zinc-finger E-box binding homeobox 1 antisense gene 1 (ZEB1-AS1) and Cullin 4B (CUL4B) were reported to be connected with the tumorigenesis of PCa. However, it is unclear whether ZEB1-AS1 regulates the expression of CUL4B in PCa. Materials and Methods: The levels of ZEB1-AS1 and CUL4B in PCa tissues and cells were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Protein levels of CUL4B, p21, CyclinD1, matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP9), E-cadherin, phosphorylated-phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (p-PI3K), PI3K phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-AKT), AKT, p-mTOR and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in PCa tissues or cells were assessed by Western blot analysis. The proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities of PCa cells were determined with 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-YI)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) or transwell assay. The interaction between ZEB1-AS1 or CUL4B and microRNA-342-3p (miR-342-3p) was predicted using starBase v2.0 database and confirmed by the dual-luciferase reporter assay. Results: ZEB1-AS1 and CUL4B were upregulated and miR-342-3p was downregulated in PCa tissues and cells. Both ZEB1-AS1 and CUL4B inhibition constrained proliferation, migration, and invasion of PCa cells. Moreover, the elevation of CUL4B reversed the effects of ZEB1-AS1 silencing on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of PCa cells. Importantly, ZEB1-AS1 modulated CUL4B expression by sponging miR-342-3p in PCa cells. Besides, ZEB1-AS1 mediated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signal pathway by miR-342-3p/CUL4B axis in PCa cells.

Patients and methods:   We conducted a population-based cohort study using the Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden of 20 350 men diagnosed between 2000 and 2016 with locally advanced PCa, defined as clinical local stage T3/T4, M0, Mx and a prostate-specific antigen level of <100 ng/mL. Cumulative PCa mortality was examined using competing risk analysis of all men with locally advanced PCa, and also including men who did not undergo radical treatment. Multivariate regression analysis, including prognostic factors, was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause and PCa-specific death.  Results:   The proportion of men treated with primary radical radiotherapy (n = 4174) or prostatectomy (n = 1210) increased from 15% in 2000-2003, 25% in 2004-2007, 33% in 2008-2011 to 43% in 2012-2016. The corresponding 5-year PCa mortality decreased from 19%, 18%, 17%, to 15% for all men, with the steepest decrease in men aged 65-74 years, from 16% to 8%. The risk of PCa mortality in men aged <80 years was lower in the last period compared to the first period, with a HR of 0.65 (95% confidence interval 0.56-0.76) in multivariate analysis.  Conclusions:   The threefold increase in use of radical treatment was accompanied by a modest decrease in PCa mortality in all men with newly diagnosed locally advanced PCa. For men aged 65-74 years, there was a 50% decrease in the relative risk of PCa death.

The survival of patients with metachronous second primary malignancy (MSPM) of BC and LuC after a first primary of BC and LuC remains unclear.  Methods:   Data of patients with BC and LuC, with or without MSPM of BC and LuC, who were diagnosed from 2000 to 2014, were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The baseline characteristics of the different groups were compared using chi-square tests. The survival curves were compared using the log-rank test. Survival analysis was also performed in other malignancies with data extracted from the SEER database using the same method.  Results:   Significant differences in most of the demographics and clinicopathological factors were found between the groups. Patients with LuC with an MSPM of BC (LuC2BC) exhibited better survival than those with LuC (P < 0.001), while patients with BC with an MSPM of LuC (BC2LuC) exhibited worse survival than those with BC (P < 0.001). A similar trend was found in other malignancies. Prostate cancer (PC) followed by thyroid cancer (TC) (PC2TC) and TC followed by PC (TC2PC) did not show an obvious survival trend against their index malignancy (IM).  Conclusions:   MSPM benefits the IM prognosis if the survival rate of MSPM is better than that of the IM and vice versa.

Among the tumor-stroma, endothelial cells (EC) evolved as critical determinants of the radiation response. CAV1 deficiency in angiogenic EC was already shown to account for increased apoptosis rates of irradiated EC. This study explores the potential impact of differential CAV1 levels in EC on the acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase)/ceramide pathway as a key player in the regulation of EC apoptosis upon irradiation and cancer cell radioresistance. Enhanced apoptosis sensitivity of CAV1-deficient EC was associated with increased ASMase activity, ceramide generation, formation of large lipid platforms, and finally an altered p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/heat-shock protein 27 (HSP27)/AKT (protein kinase B, PKB) signaling. CAV1-deficient EC increased the growth delay of LNCaP and PC3 PCa cells upon radiation treatment in direct 3D spheroid co-cultures. Exogenous C6 and C16 ceramide treatment in parallel increased the growth delay of PCa spheroids and induced PCa cell apoptosis. Analysis of the respective ceramide species in PCa cells with increased CAV1 levels like those typically found in radio-resistant advanced prostate tumors further revealed an upregulation of unsaturated C24:1 ceramide that might scavenge the effects of EC-derived apoptosis-inducing C16 ceramide. Higher ASMase as well as ceramide levels could be confirmed by immunohistochemistry in human advanced prostate cancer specimen bearing characteristic CAV1 tumor-stroma alterations.

New treatments for the primary tumor or the osteolysis hold out hope of improved survival. The few published French series were small, and we therefore undertook a multicenter retrospective analysis of PSM surgery between 2005 and December 2016, with the aim of assessing: 1) rate and type of complications, 2) functional results, and 3) overall survival and corresponding risk factors.  Hypothesis:   The French data for clinical results, survival and complications are in agreement with the international literature.  Materials and method:   The series comprised 391 patients with 434 metastatic locations. There was female predominance: 247 women (63%). Two sites were treated in 46 patients (12%), and three in 5. The main etiologies were breast cancer (151/391: 39%), lung cancer (103/391: 26%) and kidney cancer (52/391: 13%). There was synchronous visceral metastasis in 166 patients (42.5%), other peripheral locations in 137 (35%) and spinal location in 142 (39%). One hundred (27%) had ASA score>3; 61 (16%) had WHO score>3. The reason for surgery was pathologic fracture (n=137: 35%). Locations were femoral (274: 70%), acetabular (58: 15%), humeral (40: 0%), tibial (12: 3%) or other (7: 2%).  Results:   There were surgery site complications in 41 patients (9.4%), including 13 surgery site infections, and general complications in 47 patients (11%), including 11 cases of thromboembolism, 6 of blood loss, 9 pulmonary complications and 6 perioperative deaths. Overall survival, taking all etiologies and sites together, was 10 months (range, 5 days to 9 years; 95% CI, 8-13 months), and significantly better in females (14 versus 6 months; p=0.01), under-65 year-olds (p=0.001), and in preventive surgery versus fractured PSM (p=0.001). Median survival was 22 months (95% CI, 17-28 months) after breast cancer, 3 months (95% CI, 2-5 months) after lung cancer, and 17 months (95% CI, 8-58 months) after kidney cancer. Preoperatively, walking was impossible for 143 patients (38%), versus 23 (6.5%) postoperatively; 229 patients (63.5%) could walk normally or nearly normally after surgery, versus 110 (28%) before. After surgery, 3 patients (6%) were not using their operated upper limb, versus 27 (45%) before; 30 patients (54%) had normal upper limb use after surgery, versus 8 (5%) before.  Conclusion:   The study hypothesis was on the whole confirmed in terms of survival according to type of primary and whether surgery was indicated preventively or for fracture.

Role of the New VI-RADS Score: Results From a Prospective Study""","""Background:   The Vesical Imaging Reporting and Data System (VI-RADS) was recently introduced as a standardized approach to reporting multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) for bladder cancer. We aimed to prospectively analyze its routine use and its diagnostic performance in discriminating non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).  Patients and methods:   A total of 38 patients with diagnosis of suspect bladder cancer at cystoscopy underwent bladder mpMRI before transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB). Bladder tumors were categorized according to the VI-RADS. After TURB, the VI-RADS score was compared with histological report for each lesion separately. Receiving operating characteristic and decision curve analyses were used to assess its accuracy and clinical utility.  Results:   A total of 68 lesions were included, of which 7 (10.3%) were MIBC. The pooled accuracy was 90.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 75.4%-98.7%). The best threshold was estimated as VI-RADS 4, showing a sensitivity of 85.7% (95% CI, 57.1%-100%) and a specificity of 86.9% (95% CI, 78.7%-95.1%). Decision curve analyses showed that using VI-RADS ≥4 improved the net benefit compared with any default strategy for threshold probabilities of MIBC up to ∼40%, which is a reasonable clinical threshold for planning further treatments.

The current study sought to determine whether pre-treatment serum androgens predict clinical outcome among patients with metastatic CRPC treated with docetaxel chemotherapy.  Materials and methods:   Data were obtained from 1050 men who were chemotherapy-naive prior to treatment with docetaxel, prednisone, and either bevacizumab or placebo (CALGB 90401). Pretreatment serum assays for testosterone, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) were performed with tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.  Results:   Median values for testosterone, androstenedione, and DHEA were 1.00, 13.50, and 8.12 ng/dL, respectively. The median was used to define the midpoint between low and high values. In univariate analysis, median OS for low versus high levels was 21.4 and 24.2 months for testosterone, 23.8 and 21.9 months for androstenedione, and 20.2 and 25.2 months for DHEA (P = NS). In multivariable analysis of all androgens, baseline DHEA was prognostic of ≥ 50% PSA decline from baseline (P = .008). In multivariable analysis adjusting for 10 known prognostic values and prior ketoconazole use for metastatic CRPC, a 10-unit increase in baseline testosterone increased risk of death (hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.23; P = .039), whereas a 10-unit increase in androstenedione lowered risk of death (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.88-0.97; P = .001).  Conclusion:   Consistent with prior studies, higher androstenedione levels in patients with metastatic CRPC treated with docetaxel are associated with improved survival.

Relugolix, an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist, was evaluated in this clinical setting in comparison with degarelix, an injectable GnRH antagonist.  Objective:   To evaluate the safety and efficacy of relugolix to achieve and maintain castration.  Design, setting, and participants:   A phase 2 open-label study was conducted in 103 intermediate-risk PCa patients undergoing primary EBRT and neoadjuvant/adjuvant ADT between June 2014 and December 2015.  Intervention:   Patients randomly assigned (3:2) to 24-wk treatment with either daily oral relugolix or 4-wk subcutaneous depot degarelix (reference control).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary endpoint was the rate of effective castration (testosterone <1.73nmol/l) in relugolix patients between 4 and 24 wk of treatment. Secondary endpoints included rate of profound castration (testosterone <0.7nmol/l), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, prostate volume, quality of life (QoL) assessed using the Aging Males' Symptoms scale, and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life (30-item EORTC core questionnaire [EORTC QLQ-C30] and 25-item EORTC prostate cancer module [EORTC QLQ-PR25]) questionnaires, and safety. No formal statistical comparisons with degarelix were planned.  Results and limitations:   Castration rates during treatment were 95% and 82% with relugolix and 89% and 68% with degarelix for 1.73 and 0.7nmol/l thresholds, respectively. Median time to castration in the relugolix arm was 4 d. During treatment, PSA levels and prostate volumes were reduced in both groups. Three months after discontinuing treatment, 52% of men on relugolix and 16% on degarelix experienced testosterone recovery (statistical significance of differences not tested). Mean and median QoL scores improved following treatment discontinuation. The most common adverse event was hot flush (relugolix 57%; degarelix 61%). Lack of blinding was a potential limitation.  Conclusions:   Relugolix achieved testosterone suppression to castrate levels within days and maintained it over 24 wk with a safety profile consistent with its mechanism of action.

Widespread clinical implementations of MRI-only workflows are however limited by the absence of guidelines. The MR-PROTECT trial presents an MRI-only radiotherapy workflow for prostate cancer using a new single sequence strategy. The workflow incorporated the commercial synthetic CT (sCT) generation software MriPlanner™ (Spectronic Medical, Helsingborg, Sweden). Feasibility of the workflow and limits for acceptance criteria were investigated for the suggested workflow with the aim to facilitate future clinical implementations.  Methods:   An MRI-only workflow including imaging, post imaging tasks, treatment plan creation, quality assurance and treatment delivery was created with questionnaires. All tasks were performed in a single MR-sequence geometry, eliminating image registrations. Prospective CT-quality assurance (QA) was performed prior treatment comparing the PTV mean dose between sCT and CT dose-distributions. Retrospective analysis of the MRI-only gold fiducial marker (GFM) identification, DVH- analysis, gamma evaluation and patient set-up verification using GFMs and cone beam CT were performed.  Results:   An MRI-only treatment was delivered to 39 out of 40 patients. The excluded patient was too large for the predefined imaging field-of-view. All tasks could successfully be performed for the treated patients. There was a maximum deviation of 1.2% in PTV mean dose was seen in the prospective CT-QA. Retrospective analysis showed a maximum deviation below 2% in the DVH-analysis after correction for rectal gas and gamma pass-rates above 98%. MRI-only patient set-up deviation was below 2 mm for all but one investigated case and a maximum of 2.2 mm deviation in the GFM-identification compared to CT.  Conclusions:   The MR-PROTECT trial shows the feasibility of an MRI-only prostate radiotherapy workflow. A major advantage with the presented workflow is the incorporation of a sCT-generation method with multi-vendor capability. The presented single sequence approach are easily adapted by other clinics and the general implementation procedure can be replicated. The dose deviation and the gamma pass-rate acceptance criteria earlier suggested was achievable, and these limits can thereby be confirmed. GFM-identification acceptance criteria are depending on the choice of identification method and slice thickness. Patient positioning strategies needs further investigations to establish acceptance criteria.""","""['Emilia Persson', 'Christian Jamtheim Gustafsson', 'Petra Ambolt', 'Silke Engelholm', 'Sofie Ceberg', 'Sven Bäck', 'Lars E Olsson', 'Adalsteinn Gunnlaugsson']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Cone beam CT for QA of synthetic CT in MRI only for prostate patients.', 'Using C-Arm X-ray images from marker insertion to confirm the gold fiducial marker identification in an MRI-only prostate radiotherapy workflow.', 'Accuracy of an MR-only workflow for prostate radiotherapy using semi-automatically burned-in fiducial markers.', 'MRI-GUIDED RADIOTHERAPY FOR PROSTATE CANCER: A NEW PARADIGM.', 'Medical physics challenges in clinical MR-guided radiotherapy.', 'Research progress on deep learning in magnetic resonance imaging-based diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer: a review on the current status and perspectives.', 'Geometric impact and dose estimation of on-patient placement of a lightweight receiver coil in a clinical magnetic resonance imaging-only radiotherapy workflow for prostate cancer.', 'MRI-only radiotherapy from an economic perspective: Can new techniques in prostate cancer treatment be cost saving?', 'Stereotactic body radiation therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma: From infancy to ongoing maturity.', 'Prospective Clinical Feasibility Study for MRI-Only Brain Radiotherapy.']"""

Research has been devoted to MR compatible dosimeters and phantoms, but to date no end-to-end test has been presented that covers an MRgRT workflow. Such an end-to-end test should comprise each step of the workflow and include all associated uncertainties. The purpose of this study was to investigate the usability of an anthropomorphic deformable and multimodal pelvis (ADAM-pelvis) phantom in combination with film dosimetry for end-to-end testing of an MRgRT adaptive workflow. The ADAM-pelvis phantom included surrogates for muscle tissue, adipose and bone, as well as deformable silicone organs mimicking a prostate patient. At the interfaces of the critical structures (bladder and rectum), small pieces of GafChromic EBT3 films were placed to measure delivered dose. Pre-treatment MR imaging of the phantom was used to delineate the prostate, rectum and bladder and to generate a treatment plan to deliver 2 Gy to the prostate. Electron density (ED) map from CT imaging was used for dose calculation after deformable image registration (DIR) to the pre-treatment MR scan. At each fraction, bladder- and rectum filling was varied and a new adapted plan was generated. Dose calculation was performed using both a DIR-based ED map and a CT-based ED map after acquisition of a new CT scan of the phantom at each fraction. All dose calculations were performed taking into account the magnetic field. A good agreement between measured and calculated dose was found using both, the CT-derived and the DIR-based ED map (2.0% and 2.8% dose difference, respectively).

We report here crosstalk between several Akt regulatory phosphatases that controls the level of the activated form (phosphorylated) of Akt and affects tumor cell aggressiveness. In prostate cancer cell lines, we observed that transient transfection of PTEN decreased the endogenous level of PHLPPs and in contrast, the transient transfection of PHLPPs decreased the endogenous level of PTEN. Furthermore, silencing of PTEN by siRNA resulted in increased PHLPP levels. This phenomenon was not seen in non-transformed cells or in prostate stem cells. This crosstalk promoted cancer cell invasion and was controlled by epigenetically regulated processes where activation of miRs (miR-190 and miR214), the polycomb group of proteins and DNA methylation were involved. The purinergic P2X4 receptor, which has been shown to have a role in wound healing, was identified to be the mediator of this crosstalk. We also studied prostate stem cells and found this crosstalk in the TGFβ1-activated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The crosstalk seemed to be a natural part of EMT. In summary, we identify a crosstalk between Akt phosphatases which is not present in non-transformed prostate cells but occurs in cancer cells and stem cells transformed by TGFβ-1. This crosstalk is important for cellular invasion.  Background:   Phosphatases regulate the Akt oncogene.  Results:   Crosstalk between Akt phosphatases in prostate cancer cells and in TGF-β1 activated stem cells but not in non-transformed cells.

Several biomarkers were developed to inform decisions whether to perform a PB based on the probability of detecting csPCa. There is a paucity of studies directly comparing them METHODS: Between 11/2018 and 4/2019, all new referrals with the diagnosis of elevated PSA were advised to undergo 4Kscore and SelectMDx in order to guide the selection of candidates for PB. Men were advised to undergo PB if the reported biomarker risk for detecting csPCA was ≥7.5%, or if they presented a Prostate Image Reporting and Data System ≥1 MRI. Cohen's Kappa was used to assess the concordance between the binary 4Kscore and SelectMDx results using externally validated cutoffs of 7.5% and 12%. Receiver operating characteristics curve and area under the curve (AUC) assessed the performance of each biomarker for distinguishing csPCa.  Results:   Of 128 consecutive patients referred, 114 (89.1%) underwent 4Kscore and SelectMDx. The kappa coefficient between the biomarkers using the 7.5% cutoff was 0.184 (poor concordance) and 0.22 using the 12% cutoff. The two biomarkers yielded discordant guidance whether to proceed with PB in 46% and 38% of cases, respectively. csPCa was found in 22 of the 50 patients who underwent PB (44%).

The pathogenesis of CRPC is not fully understood and novel therapeutic targets need to be identified to improve the patients' prognosis. MicroRNA-30a (miR-30a) has been demonstrated to be a tumor suppressor in many types of solid malignancies. However, its role in androgen-independent (AI) growth of prostate cancer (PCa) received limited attention as yet.  Methods:   The clinical association of miR-30a and its potential targets with AI growth was characterized by bioinformatics analyses. Regulation of cell proliferation and colony formation rates by miR-30a were tested using PCa cell models. Xenograft models were used to measure the regulation of prostate tumor growth by miR-30a. The real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to validate whether miR-30a and its targets regulate cell cycle control genes and androgen receptor (AR)-dependent transcription. Bioinformatics tools, Western blot, and luciferase reporter assays were utilized to identify miR-30a targets.  Results:   Bioinformatic analysis showed that low expression of miR-30a is associated with castration resistance of PCa patients and poor outcomes. Transfection of miR-30a mimics inhibited the AI growth of PCa cells in vitro and in vivo. Upregulation of miR-30a in 22RV1 cells altered the expression of cell cycle control genes and AR-mediated transcription, while downregulation of miR-30a in LNCaP cells had the opposite effects to AR-mediated transcription. MYBL2, FOXD1, and SOX4 were identified as miR-30a targets. Downregulation of MYBL2, FOXD1, and SOX4 affected the expression of cell cycle control genes and AR-mediated transcription and suppressed the AI growth of 22RV1 cells.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that miR-30a inhibits AI growth of PCa by targeting MYBL2, FOXD1, and SOX4.

However, how depression affects the healthcare expenditures of elderly cancer patients from payers' and patients' perspectives is largely unknown. This study investigated whether depression resulted in higher healthcare expenditures among these patients from both payers' and patients' perspectives and identified health service use categories associated with increased expenditures.  Methods:   From the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS)-Medicare database, we identified breast, lung and prostate cancer patients aged 65 years and over who were newly diagnosed between 2007 and 2012. Presence of depression was based on self-reports from the surveys. We used generalized linear models (GLM) and two-part models to examine the impact of depression on healthcare expenditures during the first two years of cancer diagnosis controlling for a vast array of covariates. We stratified the analyses of total healthcare expenditures by healthcare services and payers.  Results:   Out of the 710 elderly breast, lung and prostate cancer patients in our study cohort, 128 (17.7%) reported depression. Individuals with depression had $11,454 higher total healthcare expenditures, $8213 higher medical provider expenditures and $405 higher other services expenditures compared to their counterparts without depression. Also, they were significantly more likely to have inpatient services. For payers, they incurred $8280 and $1270 higher expenditures from Medicare's and patients' perspectives, respectively.

We investigated the relationship between chemohormonal resistance and the expression of steroid receptors and Hippo pathway proteins using a docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer (PCa) cell line and human PCa tissues in patients who underwent surgery with and without neoadjuvant therapy.  Methods:   A docetaxel-resistant subline (22Rv1-DR) was generated to assess Hippo pathway protein expression and the effect of YAP1 inhibition on cellular characteristics. A tissue microarray with 203 cores from 70 high-risk localized PCa tissues was performed to assess steroid receptor and Hippo pathway protein expressions.  Results:   Nuclear YAP (nYAP) expression was higher in 22RV-1-DR than in parental 22Rv-1 and YAP1 knockdown suppressed cell proliferation of 22Rv1-DR. Steroid receptor and Hippo pathway protein expressions varied among three different neoadjuvant groups, and nYAP1 expression was the highest in the CHT group. The patients with high nYAP in residual cancer after neoadjuvant CHT had a significantly higher biochemical recurrence (BCR) rate than those with low nYAP1. On multivariate analysis, the high nYAP1 was an independent prognostic factor for BCR.  Conclusions:   nYAP expression is a potential biomarker in high-risk patients treated with docetaxel-based CHT.

We examined urine's possible antitumor capability in response to medium-level, loading-driven physical activity. Urine was collected from mice subjected to 5-minute skeletal loading and human individuals before and after 30-minute step aerobics. Six cancer cell lines (breast, prostate, and pancreas) and a mouse model of the mammary tumor were employed to evaluate the effect of urine. Compared to urine collected prior to loading, urine collected post-activity decreased the cellular viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion of tumor cells, as well as tumor weight in the mammary fat pad. Detection of urinary volatile organic compounds and ELISA assays showed that the loading-conditioned urine reduced cholesterol and elevated dopamine and melatonin. Immunohistochemical fluorescent images presented upregulation of the rate-limiting enzymes for the production of dopamine and melatonin in the brain. Molecular analysis revealed that the antitumor effect was linked to the reduction in molecular vinculin-linked molecular force as well as the downregulation of the Lrp5-CSF1-CD105 regulatory axis. Notably, the survival rate for the high expression levels of Lrp5, CSF1, and CD105 in tumor tissues was significantly lowered in the Cancer Genome Atlas database. Collectively, this study revealed that 5- or 10-minute loading-driven physical activity was sufficient to induce the striking antitumor effect by activating the neuronal signaling and repressing cholesterol synthesis.

Injection of Mobilan induced signs of self-resolving inflammation not present in placebo-injected patients, including transient elevation of PSA and cytokine (G-CSF, IL-6) levels, and increased lymphoid infiltration in prostate tissue. The highest dose of Mobilan (1011 viral particles) produced the best combination of safety and pharmacodynamic effects.

The guidelines from the American Society for Therapeutic Radiation Oncology recommend the use of fewer fractions based on randomized data. We used the National Cancer Database to examine trends in radiation fractionation for patients with bone metastases.  Methods and materials:   We queried breast, prostate, and non-small cell lung cancer in the National Cancer Database from 2010 to 2015 for patients with bone metastases at the time of diagnosis who received bone-directed radiation therapy of 8 Gy in 1 fraction, 20 Gy to 24 Gy in 5 to 6 fractions, 30 Gy in 10 fractions, or >30 Gy in 10 fractions. We tabulated the baseline characteristics, and a multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of single-fraction treatment.  Results:   We identified 17,859 patients who met the study criteria. The median patient age was 67 years, and the majority of patients (67%) had primary prostate cancer. Most patients (62%) received spine treatment. Single-fraction treatment increased over time from 3% in 2010 to 7% by 2015. Use of more protracted courses (>30 Gy in 10 fractions) decreased from 34% to 15% over the same interval. The most commonly used regimen (50%-60% of cases) remained 30 Gy in 10 fractions. Predictors of single-fraction treatment included increased age, no systemic therapy, increasing distance from facility, treatment at an academic center, nonspine/nonskull metastasis, and more recent treatment year.  Conclusions:   Use of single-fraction radiation for bone metastases has increased steadily but still accounts for <10% of palliative courses. The use of more protracted regimens has decreased significantly, although 30 Gy in 10 fractions remains the most widely used regiment.""","""['Rodney E Wegner', 'Hirsch Matani', 'Athanasios Colonias', 'Frederic Price', 'Russell Fuhrer', 'Stephen Abel']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Utilization Patterns of Single-Fraction and Short-Course Radiotherapeutic Schedules in the Management of Bone Metastases.', 'Palliation of bone metastases: a survey of patterns of practice among Canadian radiation oncologists.', 'Palliative radiation therapy (RT) for prostate cancer patients with bone metastases at diagnosis: A hospital-based analysis of patterns of care, RT fractionation scheme, and overall survival.', ""Review of patterns of practice and patients' preferences in the treatment of bone metastases with palliative radiotherapy."", 'Meta-analysis of dose-fractionation radiotherapy trials for the palliation of painful bone metastases.', 'Factors affecting local control of bone metastases from radioresistant tumors treated with palliative external beam radiotherapy.', 'Utilization Patterns of Single-Fraction and Short-Course Radiotherapeutic Schedules in the Management of Bone Metastases.', 'Local control after palliative external beam radiotherapy for bone metastases in patients with favorable prognosis.', 'Trends in Radiation Oncology Treatment Fractionation at a Single Academic Center, 2010 to 2020.', 'The Palliative Care in the Metastatic Spinal Tumors.

Ligands that integrate the ability to both quantify the distribution of radioactivity and treat disease through the use of a matched pair of radionuclides have particular value in clinical and regulatory settings. In this study, we describe the development and preclinical evaluation of RPS-085, a ligand that binds PSMA and serum albumin and exploits the 64/67Cu radionuclide pair for prostate cancer theranostics. RPS-085 was synthesized by conjugation of a PSMA-targeting moiety, an Nε-(2-(4-iodophenyl)acetyl)lysine albumin binding group, and a bifunctionalized MeCOSar chelator. The IC50 of the metal-free RPS-085 was determined in a competitive binding assay. The affinity for human serum albumin of the radiolabeled compound was determined by high-performance affinity chromatography. Radiolabeling was performed in NH4OAc buffer at 25 °C. The stability of the radiolabeled compounds was assessed in vitro and in vivo. The biodistribution of [64/67Cu]Cu-RPS-085 was determined following intravenous administration to male BALB/c mice bearing LNCaP tumor xenografts. The radiochemical yields of [64/67Cu]Cu-RPS-085 were nearly quantitative after 20 min. The metal-free complex is a potent inhibitor of PSMA (IC50 = 29 ± 2 nM), and the radiolabeled compound has moderate affinity for human serum albumin (Kd = 9.9 ± 1.7 μM). Accumulation of the tracer in mice was primarily evident in tumor and kidneys. Activity in all other tissues, including blood, was negligible, and the radiolabeled compounds demonstrated high stability in vitro and in vivo. Tumor activity reached a maximum at 4 h post injection (p.i.) and cleared gradually over a period of 96 h. By contrast, activity in the kidney cleared rapidly from 4 to 24 h p.i. As a consequence, by 24 h p.i., the tumor-to-kidney ratio exceeds 2, and the predicted dose to tumors is significantly greater than the dose to kidneys. [64Cu]Cu-RPS-085 combines rapid tissue distribution and clearance with prolonged retention in LNCaP tumor xenografts. The pharmacokinetics should enable radioligand therapy using [67Cu]Cu-RPS-085. By virtue of its rapid kidney clearance, the therapeutic index of [67Cu]Cu-RPS-085 likely compares favorably to its parent structure, [177Lu]Lu-RPS-063, a highly avid PSMA-targeting compound. On this basis, [64/67Cu]Cu-RPS-085 show great promise as PSMA-targeting theranostic ligands for prostate cancer imaging and therapy.""","""['James M Kelly', 'Shashikanth Ponnala', 'Alejandro Amor-Coarasa', 'Nicholas A Zia', 'Anastasia Nikolopoulou', 'Clarence Williams Jr', 'David J Schlyer', 'Stephen G DiMagno', 'Paul S Donnelly', 'John W Babich']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['Development of Novel PSMA Ligands for Imaging and Therapy with Copper Isotopes.', 'Albumin-Binding PSMA Ligands: Implications for Expanding the Therapeutic Window.', 'Trifunctional PSMA-targeting constructs for prostate cancer with unprecedented localization to LNCaP tumors.', 'Theranostics for Advanced Prostate Cancer: Current Indications and Future Developments.', 'Peptide and pseudo-peptide.', 'Peptide-based positron emission tomography probes: current strategies for synthesis and radiolabelling.', 'Copper-67-Labeled Bombesin Peptide for Targeted Radionuclide Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Advances in PSMA theranostics.', 'Relevance of Palladium to Radiopharmaceutical Development Considering Enhanced Coordination Properties of TE1PA.', 'Photoactivatable bis(thiosemicarbazone) derivatives for copper-64 radiotracer synthesis.']"""

The goal of this study was to optimize the composition of a 13 C-urea reference for a dual-tuned 13 C/1 H endorectal coil and minimize imaging artifacts in metabolic and multiparametric MRI studies involving hyperpolarized [1-13 C]-pyruvate.  Methods:   Due to a high amount of Gd doping for the purpose of reducing the spin-lattice relaxation time (T1 ) of urea, the 1 H signal produced by a reference of 13 C-urea in normal water was rapidly relaxed, resulting in severe artifacts in heavily T1 -weighted images. Hyperintense ringing artifacts in 1 H images were mitigated by reducing the 1 H concentration in a 13 C-urea reference via deuteration and lyophilization. Several references were fabricated and their SNR was compared using 1 H and 13 C imaging sequences on a 3T MRI scanner. Finally, 1 H prostate phantom imaging was conducted to compare image quality and 1 H signal intensity of normal and deuterated urea references.  Results:   The deuterated 13 C-urea reference provides strong 13 C signal for calibration and an attenuated 1 H signal that does not interfere with heavily T1 -weighted scans. Deuteration and lyophilization were fundamental to the reduction in 1 H signal and hyperintense ringing artifacts. There was a 25-fold reduction in signal intensity when comparing the nondeuterated reference to the deuterated reference, while the 13 C signal was unaffected.  Conclusion:   A deuterated reference reduced hyperintense ringing artifacts in 1 H images by reducing the 1 H signal produced from the 13 C-urea in the reference. The deuterated reference can be used to improve anatomical image quality in future clinical 1 H and hyperpolarized [1-13 C]-pyruvate MRI prostate imaging studies.""","""['Collin J Harlan', 'Zhan Xu', 'Keith A Michel', 'Christopher M Walker', 'Sanjaya D Lokugama', 'Gary V Martinez', 'Mark D Pagel', 'James A Bankson']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Simultaneous Metabolic and Perfusion Imaging Using Hyperpolarized 13C MRI Can Evaluate Early and Dose-Dependent Response to Radiation Therapy in a Prostate Cancer Mouse Model.', 'Development of specialized magnetic resonance acquisition techniques for human hyperpolarized 13 C,15 N2 urea + 1-13 Cpyruvate simultaneous perfusion and metabolic imaging.', 'Assessing high-intensity focused ultrasound treatment of prostate cancer with hyperpolarized 13 C dual-agent imaging of metabolism and perfusion.', 'Fast Imaging for Hyperpolarized MR Metabolic Imaging.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging of prostate cancer.', 'The effect of transmit B1 inhomogeneity on hyperpolarized 1-13 C-pyruvate metabolic MR imaging biomarkers.']"""

However, it is not known how prostate tumours affect these systems in the surrounding non-malignant tissue and vice versa. In the present study we have investigated at the mRNA level 11 components of these systems (three coding for anabolic enzymes, two for NAE/MAG targets and six coding for catabolic enzymes) in rat prostate tissue following orthotopic injection of low metastatic AT1 cells and high metastatic MLL cells. The MLL tumours expressed higher levels of Napepld, coding for a key enzyme in NAE synthesis, and lower levels of Naaa, coding for the NAE hydrolytic enzyme N-acylethanolamine acid amide hydrolase than the AT1 tumours. mRNA levels of the components of the NAE/MAG signalling systems studied in the tissue surrounding the tumours were not overtly affected by the tumours. AT1 cells in culture expressed Faah, coding for the NAE hydrolytic enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase, at much lower levels than Naaa. However, the ability of the intact cells to hydrolyse the NAE arachidonoylethanolamide (anandamide) was inhibited by an inhibitor of FAAH, but not of NAAA. Treatment of the AT1 cells with interleukin-6, a cytokine known to be involved in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer, did not affect the expression of the components of the NAE/MAG system studied. It is thus concluded that in the model system studied, the tumours show different expressions of mRNA coding for key the components of the NAE/MAG system compared to the host tissue, but that these changes are not accompanied by alterations in the non-malignant tissue.""","""['Mireille Alhouayek#', 'Linda Stafberg#', 'Jessica Karlsson#', 'Sofia Halin Bergström', 'Christopher J Fowler']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase and fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibition differentially affect N-acylethanolamine levels and macrophage activation.', 'Expression and secretion of N-acylethanolamine-hydrolysing acid amidase in human prostate cancer cells.', 'N-acylethanolamine metabolism with special reference to N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase (NAAA).', 'Interferon γ treatment increases endocannabinoid and related N-acylethanolamine levels in T84 human colon carcinoma cells.', 'Elevating endocannabinoid levels: pharmacological strategies and potential therapeutic applications.', 'The endocannabinoid system - current implications for drug development.']"""

Prostate cancer associated transcript 1 (PCAT1) is an important lncRNA that was reported to be involved in cell proliferation, migration and invasion of several types of cancer cells. However, its role in ccRCC is still undetermined. This study found that PCAT1 levels were elevated in ccRCC tumors as well as several ccRCC cells, and knockdown of PCAT1 with siRNA (si-PCAT1) alleviated cell proliferation, migration and invasion of Caki-2 and ACHN cells. With bioinformatics analysis, dual-luciferase reported assay, RNA pull-down assay and Spearman's correlation analysis, we demonstrated that PCAT1 acted as a sponge for miR-656 and miR-539. Moreover, we found dual competitive interaction of miR-656/539 with PCAT1 and yes-associated protein (YAP), resulting in the identification of PCAT1-miR-656/539-YAP axis in Caki-2 and ACHN cells.

Methods:   We examined a retrospective cohort of 322 887 adult cancer patients enrolled in commercial or Medicare Advantage products for one year after an initial diagnosis of breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer in 2008-2014.

This study investigates the prognostic predictive value of PNI in a series of patients with locally advanced prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy and androgen deprivation using 10 years outcome data from the TROG 03.04 RADAR trial.  Methods:   Diagnostic prostate biopsies from 976 patients were reviewed and the presence of PNI noted. Patients were followed for 10 years according to the trial protocol or until death. The primary endpoint for the study was time to bone metastasis. Secondary endpoints included time to soft tissue metastasis, transition to castration resistance, prostate cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality.  Results:   PNI was detected in 449 cases (46%), with 234 cases (24%) having PNI in more than one core. The presence of PNI was significantly associated with higher ISUP grade, clinical T staging category, National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk group, and percent positive biopsy cores. The cumulative probability of bone metastases according to PNI status was significant over the 10 years follow-up interval of the study (log-rank test P < 0.0001). PNI was associated with all endpoints on univariable analysis. After adjusting for baseline clinicopathological and treatment factors, bone metastasis was the only endpoint in which PNI retained its prognostic significance (hazard ratio 1.42, 95% confidence interval 1.05-1.92, P = 0.021).

Methods:   Using the National Cancer Database, we identified men diagnosed from 2012 to 2016. Men with histologically confirmed low-risk PCa defined as PSA less than 10 ng/ml, Gleason score ≤ 6, and cT1-T2a were included. The Cochran Armitage test was used to evaluate trends in surveillance versus treatment. Comparisons on surveillance adoption based on 2014 Medicaid expansion status and difference-in-difference analysis were performed.  Results:   The cohort included 84,340 men. During the study period, surveillance as initial management increased from 13.6% in 2012 to 32.1% in 2016 (p < 0.01). When comparing by Medicaid-expansion status, expansion states had higher rates in adoption of surveillance as compared to non-expansion states over the study period (36.6 vs 28.5%). Following expansion, men in expansion states were 1.94% more likely to be treated with surveillance than in earlier years (p < 0.01). Men in non-expansion states were 1.97% more likely to receive surveillance following expansion (p < 0.01) for a relative 0.03% difference in active surveillance adoption among men with low-risk PCa (95% CI - 0.004 to 0.013, p = 0.344).  Conclusion:   Based on the data from 2012 to 2016, there has been a significant increase in active surveillance as initial management for low-risk PCa in the US.

Results:   During the mean follow-up period of 5.8 years, BCR occurred in 115 (14.9%) patients and the frequency of virtual follow-up was significantly lower than the actual frequency. However, overlooking of BCR (detecting BCR when PSA exceeded 0.4 ng/ml) was observed in 17 patients, which is higher than the actual frequency of overlooking (12 patients).

Urine is considered an ideal proximal fluid for the study of EV in urological cancers due to its direct contact with the urogenital system. We demonstrate that density-based fractionation of urine by bottom-up Optiprep density gradient centrifugation separates EV and soluble proteins with high specificity and repeatability. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of urinary EV (uEV) in men with benign and malignant prostate disease allowed us to significantly expand the known human uEV proteome with high specificity and identifies a unique biological profile in prostate cancer not uncovered by the analysis of soluble proteins. In addition, profiling the proteome of EV separated from prostate tumour conditioned medium and matched uEV confirms the specificity of the identified uEV proteome for prostate cancer. Finally, a comparative proteomic analysis with uEV from patients with bladder and renal cancer provided additional evidence of the selective enrichment of protein signatures in uEV reflecting their respective cancer tissues of origin.

Our retrospective study evaluates the prognostic role of early PSA drop in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients receiving abiraterone acetate (AA) or enzalutamide (E).  Methods:   All mCRPC patients treated with AA or E at the San Luigi Hospital in Orbassano between 2010 and 2018 and at the Ordine Mauriziano Hospital in Turin between 2014 and 2018 were included in this retrospective study. Only patients with an early PSA (measured 28-60 days after the beginning of the treatment) were included in the analysis. Patients were divided in early responders and non-early responders according to early PSA response (drop≥50% from baseline). Univariate and multivariate analyses for progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were performed.  Results:   Of 144 patients with early PSA value, 61 (42.4%) patients received E (docetaxel-naïve 42, post-docetaxel 19) and 83 (57.6%) received AA (docetaxel-naïve 44, post-docetaxel 39).

However, its role in prostate cancer development is not fully understood. Herein, we determined expression pattern of FAM46C in prostate cancer and further identified its effect on the tumorigenesis and chemosensitivity. FAM46C expression was decreased in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines compared with corresponding controls. FAM46C expression was significantly associated with the Gleason score, tumor size and overall survival. FAM46C knockdown in 22RV1 and DU145 cells significantly inhibited apoptosis and promoted cell proliferation and cell cycle progression as well as activation of AKT. FAM46C overexpression had an inverse effect in DU145 cells and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. FAM46C inhibited cell proliferation and cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis via the PTEN/AKT signaling pathway. FAM46C promoted PTEN expression through inhibiting PTEN ubiquitination. The prostate cancer cells and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mice with high-FAM46C-expressing demonstrated an enhanced chemosensitivity to docetaxel. These findings suggest that FAM46C control cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis through PTEN/AKT signaling pathway and is associated with chemosensitivity of prostate cancer.

Resistance to Docetaxel and its side effects remain as obstacle for its efficacy in monotherapy. Recently, combination with novel adjuvants have been emerged as a beneficial alternative strategy, which targets multiple important pathways and also requires lower therapeutic dosage, proposing as a strategy to overcome drug resistance. This study investigated whether Liraglutide, a Glucagon Like Peptide-1 Receptor agonist, can reinforce the effect of Docetaxel on LNCaP prostate cancer cell line. Cells were treated by Liraglutide and Docetaxel, alone and in combination. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT assay. Compusyn and Combenefit softwares were used in order to evaluate synergistic efficacy. Apoptosis was determined by Cell cycle analysis and Annexin-V/Propidium iodide staining through flow cytometry. However, the mRNA level of pro-apoptotic gene ""Bax"" and anti-apoptotic ""Bcl-2"" were evaluated by quantitative Real-Time PCR. Also, phosphorylation level of ERK1/2 and AKT proteins was investigated by western blotting technique. The results showed that Docetaxel and Liraglutide decreased the viability of LNCaP cells synergistically, caused cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis potentially. The key proteins' evaluation in ERK/MAPK and AKT/PI3K pathways revealed a significant reduction in phosphorylation level of cells exposed to combination of drugs.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen-targeted radionuclide therapy is a potential treatment for these patients. Here, we report our initial experience in Singapore.  Methods:   Twenty men (median age 70) with progressive disease were prospectively recruited. Prostate-specific membrane antigen and fluorodeoxyglucose-PET/computed tomography were performed to confirm high prostate-specific membrane antigen-expression. Up to four cycles of lutetium-prostate-specific membrane antigen-I&T at 6-8 weekly intervals were administered. Patients were restaged 3 months following treatment. Primary endpoints were prostate-specific antigen decline ≥50% and treatment-related toxicity. Additional endpoints included radiological and clinical response as well as progression-free survival and overall survival from first cycle.  Results:   Sixty-seven cycles were administered (median 4 cycles per patient, mean 6.5 GBq per cycle). Sixty five percent had ≥1 line of prior chemotherapy, 90% abiraterone, enzalutamide or both, and 30% radium-223 radionuclide therapy. All had bone metastases and 35% had visceral metastases. Prostate-specific antigen decline ≥50% was achieved in 50%. Grade 3-4 hematotoxicity was seen in up to 15%. Grade 3-4 non-hematotoxicity was not observed. Eleven patients had restaging scans 3 months post-treatment (5 = partial response, 6 = progressive disease). Fifty-seven percent (4/7) with bone pain had pain improvement. Median progression-free survival was 5.9 months and median overall survival 13.1 months.

Only half of androgen-responsive genes have been identified as having androgen-responsive elements, suggesting that AR regulates downstream genes through other transcriptional factors. However, whether and how AR regulates the progression via regulating these androgen-responsive genes remains unclear.  Methods:   Androgen-responsive and activity-changed (AC) transcriptional factors (TFs) were identified based on the time-course gene-expression array and gene promoter regions analysis. The intersection of androgen-responsive and AC TFs was selected the core TFs, which were used to construct the core transcriptional regulatory network. GO enrichment analysis, cell proliferation assays, glycolysis experiments, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis were used to analyze and validate the functions of the network. As one of the core TFs, the function and mechanism of IRF1 have been further explored.  Results:   We devised a new integrated approach to select core TFs and construct core transcriptional regulatory network in PCa. The 24 core TFs and core transcriptional regulatory network participate in regulating PCa cell proliferation, RNA splicing, and cancer metabolism. Further validations showed that AR signaling could promote glycolysis via inducing glycolytic enzymes in PCa cells. IRF1, a novel target of AR, served as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting PCa proliferation, cell cycle, and glycolysis.  Conclusions:   It is the first time to demonstrate the regulating role of the AR-mediated transcriptional regulatory network in a series of important biological processes in PCa cells. IRF1, an AR-regulated TF, acts as tumor suppressor in this core transcriptional regulatory network, which highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting this regulatory network for PCa.""","""['Yihang Cheng', 'Dan Wang', 'Jun Jiang', 'Wenhua Huang', 'Dujian Li', 'Jun Luo', 'Wei Gu', 'Wenjuan Mo', 'Chenji Wang', 'Yao Li', 'Shaohua Gu', 'Yaoting Xu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Novel lncRNA LINC00844 Regulates Prostate Cancer Cell Migration and Invasion through AR Signaling.', 'The tumor suppressor ING1b is a novel corepressor for the androgen receptor and induces cellular senescence in prostate cancer cells.', 'MiR137 is an androgen regulated repressor of an extended network of transcriptional coregulators.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Androgen Receptor-Mediated Transcription in Prostate Cancer.', 'The Identification of Key Genes and Biological Pathways in Heart Failure by Integrated Bioinformatics Analysis.']"""

Therefore, we systematically investigated the molecular differences in KLFs of transcription expression, promoter methylation and genetic alteration. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression was used to analyse the effect on RFS and establish the prognostic signature in the TCGA cohort, MSKCC and GSE116918 cohorts employed to validate the signature. Biological pathway enrichment and the potential response to immunotherapy and chemotherapy were inferred. The transcription levels of most KLFs are associated with the clinical outcome of PCa. Gleason score (P = .009), pathology T stage (P = .006), KLF3 (P = .034), KLF5 (P = .002) and KLF7 (P = .035) were independent prognostic factors. A prognostic signature was established in the TCGA cohort (P < .001) and validated in the MSKCC (P < .001) and GSE116918 cohorts (P = .006). Demethylation of KLF5 by 5-azacytidine led to increased protein levels, whereas knockdown of KLF5 promoted cell proliferation. Patients in KLF-F were more likely to respond to immunotherapy (P < .001) and bicalutamide (P < .001). In summary, we found that the KLFs and clinical feature-based signatures may improve prognosis prediction in PCa and further promote patient stratification and disease management.""","""['Jialin Meng', 'Xiaofan Lu', 'Yujie Zhou', 'Meng Zhang', 'Lei Gao', 'Shenglin Gao', 'Fangrong Yan', 'Chaozhao Liang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Cell Mol Med""","""['Krüppel-Like Factor 7 is a Marker of Aggressive Gastric Cancer and Poor Prognosis.', 'Long non-coding RNA LINC00673 silencing inhibits proliferation and drug resistance of prostate cancer cells via decreasing KLF4 promoter methylation.', 'Epigenetic signature of Gleason score and prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'The emerging role of Krüppel-like factors in endocrine-responsive cancers of female reproductive tissues.', 'Krüppel-like factor (KLF)5: An emerging foe of cardiovascular health.', 'Krüppel-like factors in tumors: Key regulators and therapeutic avenues.', 'Identification of ZDHHC1 as a Pyroptosis Inducer and Potential Target in the Establishment of Pyroptosis-Related Signature in Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblast-derived gene signatures predict radiotherapeutic survival in prostate cancer patients.', 'Establishment of a five-enzalutamide-resistance-related-gene-based classifier for recurrence-free survival predicting of prostate cancer.', 'A cellular senescence-related gene prognostic index for biochemical recurrence and drug resistance in patients with prostate cancer.']"""

Introduction of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-based radiotracers for imaging and therapy had gained increasing attention in recent years. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with Ga68 PSMA is the most promising technique, but PSMA-based radiotracers SPECT imaging with low dose of 177Lu-PSMA when PET imaging is not available may also be considered. The goal of the study is to evaluate the sensitivity of 177Lu_psma for detection of metastatic sites in patients with biochemical relapse and negative conventional (MRI, MRS, CT scan and bone scintigraphy) imaging.  Materials & methods:   26 patients with biochemical recurrence after curative (surgery and/or radiotherapy) therapy, which had previous negative imaging as pelvic CT scan, pelvic MRI, MRS and bone scan, were enrolled in this clinical imaging approach between 2015 and 2017.After injection of 5 mCi (185MBq)177Lu-PSMA-617, diagnostic planar whole body scan and SPECT study was obtained after 3 hours, 24 hours and 72 hours . The images were analyzed visually by an expert nuclear medicine physician for the presence of active regional or distant lesions. Results were then prospectively checked by new CT scan images as a control.  Result:   A total of 26 patients, with a mean age of 70 years (range: 46 to 89 years) were included in this study. The overall detection rates were 38.5% (10 out of 26 patients). Most common site of detected lesions was lung in 6 patients, abdominal lymph nodes in 2 and mediastinum in another 2 patients.

While metastasis-directed approaches are used for palliation, the primary goal of such treatment for patients with oligometastases is to prolong survival and the duration of cancer control. Metastasis-directed therapy, for patients with limited number of metastatic sites, has been practiced for decades, dating back to the era before chemotherapy was widely used. Systemic therapy has become the accepted standard of care for metastatic disease. And while not curative for most solid cancers, systemic therapy can delay cancer progression, prolong life, and maintain or improve quality of life, albeit often at the expense of toxicities which can adversely impact quality of life. From the 1960s to 1980s, prominent physicians questioned whether metastasis-directed resection or radiotherapy could potentially be curative treatment approaches. In 1995, Drs. Hellman and Weichselbaum wrote an editorial that coined the term ""oligometastases"" and refined the hypothesis of metastasis-directed surgical and radiotherapeutic treatments as potentially curative for select patients. Their article was the first to explicitly describe the clinical state of metastases existing along a spectrum, with a spectrum of behaviors (ranging from indolent disease confined to limited sites to widespread disease) and, therefore, a spectrum of potential treatments. In the ensuing decades, there were rapid technologic advancements in radiotherapy, including stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), which facilitated delivery of ablative doses of radiation to precisely and accurately targeted tumors. SBRT has been considered an optimal non-surgical approach to treat oligometastases, allowing for definitive-dose delivery and for targeting accuracy that minimizes normal tissue radiation exposure. In the early 2000s, many institutions began publishing prospective studies demonstrating favorable outcomes in patients with oligometastases treated with SBRT. Not answered in these single-arm studies was whether patients generally fared better than expected due to selection of patients with relatively indolent disease, or from metastasis-directed treatment. There is also a potential for immortal time bias with non-randomized comparisons. However, recent randomized phase II studies have suggested that SBRT for oligometastases is associated with improved survival outcomes. Phase III studies, many specific for certain cancers (i.e., breast, prostate or lung cancers) are accruing. Future work will be needed to identify which patients are most apt to benefit from metastasis-directed therapy; in addition to clinical factors, host and/or tumor genomics may prove to be prognostic. Metastasis-directed therapy may become more important with improvements in systemic therapy in controlling micrometastatic disease. Incorporating immunotherapy with SBRT may also be a promising approach, with SBRT perhaps augmenting the immune response. As personalized medicine evolves, patients with oligometastases will be better served. The history of oligometastases will continue to unfold.""","""['Michael T Milano', 'Tithi Biswas', 'Charles B Simone nd', 'Simon S Lo']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Ann Palliat Med""","""['Efficacy of extracranial stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) added to\xa0standard treatment in patients with solid tumors (breast, prostate and non-small cell lung cancer)\xa0with up to 3 bone-only metastases: study protocol for a randomised phase III trial (STEREO-OS).', 'Stereotactic Radiation for Oligometastatic and Oligoprogressive Stage IV Breast Cancer: A Case-Based Review.', 'Oligometastatic breast cancer: where are we now and where are we headed?-a narrative review.', 'Oligometastases treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy: long-term follow-up of prospective study.', 'Modern evidence and future prospects of external body radiation therapy for lung oligometastases of breast cancer.', 'Automatic tumor segmentation and metachronous single-organ metastasis prediction of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients based on multi-sequence magnetic resonance imaging.', 'A survey of open questions in adaptive therapy: Bridging mathematics and clinical translation.', 'Cytoreductive radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy for metastases prostate cancer: Evidence from meta-analysis.', 'Local Consolidative Therapy for Oligometastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Palliative oncology and palliative care.']"""

Herein, the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of miR-381 on autophagy and apoptosis of PCa cells through the reelin (RELN)-mediated the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.  Methods:   PCa-related differentially expressed genes and regulatory miRNA were retrieved according to microarray-based analysis and online mRNA-miRNA interaction analysis. The regulatory relationship between miR-381 and RELN was verified by bioinformatics prediction and dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were applied to analyze the effects of miR-381 and RELN on the abilities of proliferation, apoptosis as well as autophagy of PCa cells. Furthermore, xenograft tumor was developed in nude mice to examine the tumorigenic ability of PCa.  Key findings:   RELN, which was found to be up-regulated in PCa, was identified as a target of miR-381. Overexpressed miR-381 suppressed PCa cell proliferation while promoted autophagy and apoptosis of PCa cells. In addition, miR-381 inhibited the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway by targeting RELN. In vivo experiments also confirmed that overexpression of miR-381 could inhibit the tumorigenic ability of PCa.

In this study, the chemical composition of the EO from Cymbopogon nardus was characterized, as well as its antioxidativeproperties and anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative activities on LNCaP cells derived from prostate cancer. Methods The chemical composition of the EO was determined by GC/FID and GC/MS analyses. The antioxidative properties were assessed using DPPH radical scavenging assay and ABTS+• radical cation decolorization assay, and the anti-inflammatory capacity was determined by the inhibition of the lipoxygenase activity. Antiproliferative activity was evaluated by MTT assay. Results Collectively, our data show that the major constituents of C. nardus EO are citronellal (33.06 %), geraniol (28.40 %), nerol (10.94 %), elemol (5.25 %) and delta-elemene (4.09 %). C. nardus EO shows modest antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity compared to the standard galic acid. C. nardus EO exhibits the best antiproliferative activity on the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP with an IC50 of 58.0 ± 7.9 μg/mL, acting through the induction of the cell cycle arrest.

However, due to a lack of long-term follow-up and late toxicity data, this treatment is not universally accepted. The present study aimed to evaluate outcome and early and late toxicity in a cohort of patients with low- and intermediate-risk PC treated prospectively with linear accelerator (linac)-based SBRT.  Patients and methods:   Patients with low- or intermediate-risk (NCCN criteria) PC were included. All patients received linac-based SBRT to 35 Gy in 5 fractions delivered on alternate days. Endpoints were toxicity, biochemical relapse-free survival (BRFS), metastatic progression-free survival (mPFS), and overall survival (OS).  Results:   From 2012 to 2018, 178 patients were treated. Median baseline prostate-specific antigen (iPSA) was 6.37 ng/ml (range 1.78-20). Previous transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) was present in 23 (12.9%) patients. Median follow-up was 58.9 months (range 9.7-89.9). BRFS rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 98.3 (95% confidence interval, CI, 94.7-99.4%), 94.4 (95%CI 89.4-97), and 91.6% (95%CI 85.4-95.2), respectively. In univariate analysis, performance status (PS), iPSA, and nadir PSA (nPSA) were correlated with BRFS. In multivariable analysis iPSA and nPSA remained significant. BRFS rates at 5 years were 94.9% (95%CI 86.8-98) for International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade group 1, 93.2% (95%CI 80.5-97.7) for ISUP group 2, and 74.8% (95%CI 47.1-89.5) for ISUP group 3. At 1, 3, and 5 years, mPFS rates were 98.8 (95%CI 95.5-99.7), 96.2 (95%CI 91.9-98.3), and 92.9% (95%CI 87.2-96.2), respectively; OS rates were 100, 97.2 (95%CI 92.9-98.9), and 95.1% (95%CI 90-97.6), respectively. One (0.56%) case of grade 3 acute genitourinary (GU), one case of acute gastrointestinal (GI), and one case of grade 3 late GU toxicity were observed. GI toxicity positively correlated with prostate volume.  Conclusion:   At long-term follow-up, linac-based SBRT continues to be a valid option for the management localized PC. Biochemical control remains high at 5 years, albeit with some concerns regarding the optimal schedule for unfavorable intermediate-risk PC. Considering the excellent prognosis, patient selection is crucial for prevention of severe late toxicity.""","""['Ciro Franzese', 'Marco Badalamenti', 'Lucia Di Brina', ""Giuseppe D'Agostino"", 'Davide Franceschini', 'Tiziana Comito', 'Elena Clerici', 'Pierina Navarria', 'Giacomo Reggiori', 'Pietro Mancosu', 'Stefano Tomatis', 'Marta Scorsetti']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Strahlenther Onkol""","""['Phase\xa0II study of accelerated Linac-based SBRT in five consecutive fractions for localized prostate cancer.', 'Linac-based SBRT as a\xa0feasible salvage option for local recurrences in previously irradiated prostate cancer.', 'Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for clinically localized prostate cancer: the Georgetown University experience.', 'A single institution analysis of low-dose-rate brachytherapy: 5-year reported survival and late toxicity outcomes.', 'Salvage stereotactic body radiation therapy for locally recurrent prostate cancer following primary radiation therapy, are benefits worth toxicity risks?: A systematic review.', 'Cellular Damage in the Target and Out-Of-Field Peripheral Organs during VMAT SBRT Prostate Radiotherapy: An In Vitro Phantom-Based Study.', 'Biologically Effective Dose and Rectal Bleeding in Definitive Proton Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Dosimetric benefits of daily treatment plan adaptation for prostate cancer stereotactic body radiotherapy.', 'Stereotactic body radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer - 5-year efficacy results.']"""

This study aimed to investigate the association between sarcopenia and survival in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.  Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated 197 patients diagnosed with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer in our department and its affiliated institution between January 2008 and December 2015. Sarcopenia was diagnosed according to the sex-specific consensus definition. Castration-resistance prostate cancer-free survival, cancer-specific survival and overall survival from the metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer diagnoses were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Risk factors affecting the survival outcomes were analyzed using the Cox proportional regression analysis.  Results:   In total, 163 patients (82.7%) had sarcopenia. Cancer-specific survival and overall survival were significantly shorter in sarcopenic patients than in non-sarcopenic patients (median cancer-specific survival: 77.0 months vs. not reached, P = 0.0099; overall survival: 72.0 months vs. not reached, P = 0.0465), whereas castration-resistance prostate cancer-free survival did not significantly differ between the groups (P = 0.6063). Multivariate analyses showed that sarcopenia was an independent factor for cancer-specific survival (hazard ratio: 2.18, P = 0.0451), together with the Gleason score (hazard ratio: 1.87, P = 0.0272) and LATITUDE risk classification (hazard ratio: 2.73, P = 0.0008). Moreover, the prognostic association of sarcopenia was remarkable in patients aged <73.0 years (cancer-specific survival: 82.0 months vs. not reached, P = 0.0027; overall survival: 72.0 months vs. not reached, P = 0.0078 in sarcopenic vs. non-sarcopenic patients), whereas the association was not significant in patients aged ≥73.0 years (cancer-specific survival: 76.0 and 75.0 months, respectively, P = 0.7879; overall survival: 67.0 and 52.0 months, respectively, P = 0.7263).

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) uptake has been described in both benign and malignant bone lesions, which can lead to false-positive findings on 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET for osseous prostate cancer metastases and improve bone uptake interpretation using semiquantitative metrics. Methods: Fifty-six prostate cancer patients (18 before prostatectomy and 38 with biochemical recurrence) who underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI or PET/CT examinations with osseous PSMA-ligand uptake were included in the study. Medical records were reviewed retrospectively by board-certified nuclear radiologists to determine true or false positivity based on a composite endpoint. For each avid osseous lesion, we measured biologic volume; size; PSMA Reporting and Data System (RADS) rating; SUVmax; and ratio of lesion SUVmax to liver, blood pool, and background bone SUVmax Differences between benign and malignant lesions were evaluated for statistical significance, and cutoffs for these parameters were determined to maximize diagnostic accuracy. Results: Among 56 participants, 13 (22.8%) had false-positive osseous 68Ga-PSMA-11 findings and 43 (76.8%) had true-positive osseous 68Ga-PSMA-11 findings. Twenty-two patients (39%) had 1 osseous lesion, 18 (32%) had 2-4 lesions, and 16 (29%) had 5 or more lesions. Cutoffs resulting in statistically significant (P < 0.005) differences between benign and malignant lesions were a PSMA RADS rating of at least 4, an SUVmax of at least 4.1, and SUVmax ratios of at least 2.11 for lesion to blood pool, at least 0.55 for lesion to liver, and at least 4.4 for lesion to bone. These measurements corresponded to a lesion-based 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET lesion detection rate of 80%, 93%, 89%, 21%, and 89%, respectively, for malignancy, and a specificity of 73%, 73%, 73%, 93%, and 60%, respectively. Conclusion: PSMA RADS rating, SUVmax, and SUVmax ratio for lesion to blood pool can help differentiate benign from malignant lesions on 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET. An SUVmax ratio of more than 2.2 for lesion to blood pool is a reasonable parameter to support image interpretation and presented a superior lesion detection rate and specificity when compared with visual interpretation by PSMA RADS. These parameters hold clinical value by improving diagnostic accuracy for metastatic prostate cancer on 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI and PET/CT.""","""['Le Wen Chiu', 'Courtney Lawhn-Heath', 'Spencer C Behr', 'Roxanna Juarez', 'Paola M Perez', 'Iryna Lobach', 'Matthew D Bucknor', 'Thomas A Hope', 'Robert R Flavell']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', '68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT derived quantitative volumetric tumor parameters for classification and evaluation of therapeutic response of bone metastases in prostate cancer patients.', 'Solitary rib lesions showing prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) uptake in pre-treatment staging 68 Ga-PSMA-11 positron emission tomography scans for men with prostate cancer: benign or malignant?', 'Sensitivity, Specificity, and Predictors of Positive 68Ga-Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography in Advanced Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Can Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT replace conventional imaging modalities for primary lymph node and bone staging of prostate cancer?', 'Assessment of 18F-DCFPyL PSMA PET/CT and PET/MR quantitative parameters for reference standard organs: Inter-reader, inter-modality, and inter-patient variability.', 'PET Criteria by Cancer Type from Imaging Interpretation to Treatment Response Assessment: Beyond FDG PET Score.', 'Incidence of PSMA PET thyroid incidentaloma depends on analysis method and tracer.', 'The global status of research in prostate cancer bone metastasis: A bibliometric and visualized analysis.', 'PET-CT in Clinical Adult Oncology-IV.

Methods:   In SEER*Stat, we examined age-specific and age-adjusted prostate cancer incidence, distant stage diagnosis, and mortality rates by race/ethnicity, census region, and age group. Incidence and mortality analyses included men diagnosed with (n = 723,269) and dying of (n = 112,116) prostate cancer between 2012 and 2015.  Results:   Non-Hispanic black (NHB) and non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander (NHAPI) men had the highest and lowest rates, respectively, for each indicator across regions and age groups.

Materials and methods:   Medical records of patients referred from 11 medical centers for MR-guided prostate biopsy (MRGpB) between October, 2017 and January, 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with at least one prostate imaging reporting and data system (PI-RADS) 3 or greater prostate lesion were selected, and the mpMRI studies (all read by others) were reviewed by our prostate mpMRI reader. Outcomes included changes in PI-RADS score and the subsequent effect on total needle samples and indication for biopsy.  Results:   Eighty-two patients with 128 lesions were suitable for analysis (mean age 66.5 ± 7.1 years, mean PSA 6.8 ± 8.5 ng/ml). Nine (11%) patients had suspicious rectal exams (T2a). Following our prostate mpMRI reader's imaging revisions, the PI-RADS score was downgraded in 66 (52%) lesions, upgraded in 15 (12%), and unchanged in 47 (37%), leaving a total of 84 suspected lesions (kappa = 0.17). Biopsy was deferred in 22 (27%) patients, and an estimated 136.4 (34.4%) samples were avoided (P = 0.0001 for both). There was a trend toward prostate size to correlate with imaging revision and abortion of biopsy (P = 0.06) while enrollment in active surveillance correlated with proof from such outcome (P = 0.007).

The PIF inhibits the mobilized bladder from resealing over its lateral dissection planes, which overly the lymphadenectomy beds. This creates a window for lymphatic fluid to drain into the peritoneal cavity where it can be absorbed. Herein, we externally validate its utility in preventing postoperative SL formation and assess its effect on postoperative urinary function. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all consecutive patients who underwent RARP with bilateral PLND by a single surgeon between July 2016 and September 2019. All patients who underwent surgery before August 8, 2018 did not receive the PIF, while those who underwent surgery after August 8, 2018 received the PIF. Our PIF technique involves fixing the peritoneum overlying the lateral dome of the bladder to the ipsilateral, anterior-lateral surface of the bladder using a barbed absorbable suture. Continuous and categorical variables were compared between the two groups using independent t-tests and chi-square tests, respectively; p < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Of 318 total patients, 201 did not undergo the PIF and 117 underwent the PIF. With regard to postoperative complications, patients undergoing the PIF had a lower incidence of SL compared with those not undergoing the PIF (0.0% vs 6.0%, p = 0.007). There was no difference in 30-day postoperative nonlymphocele complications (Clavien >2) between both groups (p = 0.800). With regard to urinary function, there was no difference in the rate of 3-month postoperative continence (p = 0.624), preoperative American Urological Association Symptom Score (AUASS) (p = 0.898), and postoperative AUASS (p = 0.470) between both groups. Conclusion: Utilization of a PIF may minimize the risk of SL formation after RARP and PLND without increasing the risk of non-SL-related complications. This technique does not adversely affect postoperative urinary function.""","""['Matthew Lee', 'Ziho Lee', 'Daniel D Eun']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Re: ""Utilization of a Peritoneal Interposition Flap to Prevent Symptomatic Lymphoceles After Robotic Radical Prostatectomy and Bilateral Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection"" by Lee et al.', 'Bilateral Peritoneal Flaps Reduce Incidence and Complications of Lymphoceles after Robotic Radical Prostatectomy with Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection-Results of the Prospective Randomized Multicenter Trial ProLy.', 'Effect of Peritoneal Fixation (PerFix) on Lymphocele Formation in Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy with Pelvic Lymphadenectomy: Results of a Randomized Prospective Trial.', 'Novel Technique Prevents Lymphoceles After Transperitoneal Robotic-assisted Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection: Peritoneal Flap Interposition.', 'How to minimize lymphoceles and treat clinically symptomatic lymphoceles after radical prostatectomy.', 'Pelvic lymph node dissection during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: efficacy, limitations, and complications-a systematic review of the literature.', 'High BMI and Surgical Time Are Significant Predictors of Lymphocele after Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Outcomes over 20\xa0years performing robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy: a single-surgeon experience.', 'Risk factors for lymphorrhea and lymphocele after radical prostatectomy: a retrospective case-control study.', 'Bilateral Peritoneal Flaps Reduce Incidence and Complications of Lymphoceles after Robotic Radical Prostatectomy with Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection-Results of the Prospective Randomized Multicenter Trial ProLy.', 'The effect of peritoneal re-approximation on lymphocele formation in transperitoneal robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymphadenectomy.']"""

Early evidence demonstrates encouraging short-medium-term outcomes. With no randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing FT to radical therapies, Comparative Healthcare Research Outcomes of Novel Surgery in prostate cancer (CHRONOS) will compare the cancer control of these two strategies.  Patients and methods:   CHRONOS is a parallel phase II RCT for patients with clinically significant non-metastatic prostate cancer, dependent upon clinician/patient decision, patients will enrol into either CHRONOS-A or CHRONOS-B. CHRONOS-A will randomize patients to either radical treatment or FT. CHRONOS-B is a multi-arm, multistage RCT comparing focal therapy alone to FT with neoadjuvant agents that might improve the current focal therapy outcomes. An internal pilot will determine the feasibility of, and compliance to, randomization. The proposed definitive study plans to recruit and randomize 1190 patients into CHRONOS-A and 1260 patients into CHRONOS-B.  Results:   Primary outcome in CHRONOS-A is progression-free survival (transition to salvage local or systemic therapy, development of metastases or prostate-cancer-related mortality) and in CHRONOS-B is failure-free survival (includes the above definition and recurrence of clinically significant prostate cancer after initial FT). Secondary outcomes include adverse events, health economics and functional outcomes measured using validated questionnaires. CHRONOS is powered to assess non-inferiority of FT compared to radical therapy in CHRONOS-A, and superiority of neoadjuvant agents with FT in CHRONOS-B.

These dual-modality imaging technologies enable whole-body functional and anatomical evaluation in a single session. This study investigated the performance of Ga-prostate-specific-membrane-antigen-11 positron-emission-tomography/computed-tomography for detecting prostate carcinoma in patients with rising prostate-specific-antigen after primary therapy. Six hundred sixty (660) patients with biochemical recurrence referred for positron-emission-tomography/computed-tomography with Ga-prostate-specific-membrane-antigen-11 were evaluated retrospectively. Prostate-specific-antigen-stratified cohorts of pathological scan results were analyzed, and relationships between prostate-specific-antigen kinetics and PSMA-positive tumor lesions were correlated. Gallium-68 prostate-specific-membrane-antigen-11 positron-emission-tomography/computed-tomography showed a pathological prostate-specific-membrane-antigen uptake in 76% (500 of 660 patients). Positive scans were positively associated with prostate-specific-antigen (p<0.001). For patients with prostate-specific-antigen <0.2 ng mL, the PSMA-positive tumor lesions rate was 41%. Patients with prostate-specific-antigen of 0.2-<0.5 ng mL, 0.5-<1.0 ng mL, 1.0-<2.0 ng mL, and 2.0-<5.0 ng mL showed rates of 44.7%, 61.7%, 72.3%, 85.2%, respectively, and for prostate-specific-antigen of ≥5.0 ng mL it increased to 94%. Prostate-specific-antigen velocity was also correlated with PSMA-positive tumor lesions (p<0.001). In contrast, no association was found for prostate-specific-antigen doubling time (p=0.74). PSMA-positive tumor lesions were significantly increased in patients with primary intermediate- (Gleason Score7) and high-risk (Gleason Score>7) vs. low-risk prostate cancer (Gleason Score<7) (p<0.001). Our data confirm the high performance of Ga-prostate-specific-membrane-antigen positron-emission-tomography/computed-tomography for the detection of recurrent prostate cancer.

Standardization of the surgical management is lacking. The aim of this study was to report our experience with surgery for RUF.  Methods:   This was a retrospective study of a prospectively maintained clinical database. The surgical strategy was tailored to complexity of RUF, presence of sepsis, history of radiation and residual urinary/fecal functionality. Outcomes measured were RUF closure and permanent fecal/urinary diversion. Impact of radiotherapy was also assessed.  Results:   Between November 2002 and January 2019, 52 patients were identified (100% males). Median follow-up was 10.5 (0.5-16.8) years. Three patients had RUF closure after conservative management. The remaining 49 patients had a total of 76 procedures. The cumulative closure rate after the first, second and third attempt was 55.1%, 85.7% and 95.9%, respectively. Fistula closure together with preservation of the fecal and urinary function was achieved in 49%, 65.3% and 67.3% after the first, second and third repair, respectively. The overall success rate for transanal, transperineal, restorative transabdominal and non-restorative transabdominal procedures was 35.7%, 64.3%, 57.1% and 94.1%, respectively. A significantly higher rate of urinary/intestinal stomas was observed in the irradiated vs non-irradiated patients (84.2% vs 42.4%; p = 0.004).  Conclusions:   Surgery ensured healing in 96% of the patients. Radiotherapy led to higher rate of permanent urinary/fecal diversion.

We evaluated if a prototype ""tracked Foley catheter"" (TFC) could maintain fusion image alignment after simulated organ motion.  Methods:   A pelvic phantom model underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the prostate was segmented. The TFC was placed in the phantom. MRI/ultrasound (US) fusion was performed. Four trials were performed varying motion and TFC presence/absence: (1) TFC/no-motion, (2) TFC/motion, (3) no-TFC/no-motion, and (4) no-TFC/motion. To quantify image alignment, screen captures generated Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and offset distances (ODs) (maximal US-to-MRI distance between edges on fusion images). Three anatomical targets were identified for placement of a needle under fusion guidance. A computed tomography scan was used to measure system error (SE), i.e., the distance from needle tip to intended target.  Results:   The TFC presence improved MRI/US alignment by DSC 0.88, 0.88, 0.74, and 0.61 in trials 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

In contrast, only a minority of sporadic tumors show alterations in these genes. As a result, genomic instability is currently considered an enhancer of tumorigenesis rather than an obligatory event in this process. However, tumor heterogeneity presents a significant technical challenge for most cancer genomics studies performed at less than 100× mean resolution depth. To address the importance of genomic instability in prostate carcinogenesis and tumor progression, we performed ultrahigh depth exome sequencing of 124 DNA damage repair/response (repairome) genes in 63 tumors and matched normal tissue samples in African Americans and Caucasians. The average sequence depth was 712-fold for DNA isolated from normal tissue and 368-fold for FFPE tumors. We identified 671 somatic mutations in tumors from African Americans and 762 somatic mutations in tumors in Caucasians. The most frequently mutated DNA repairome genes were EXO1, ATR, POLQ, NEIL3, ERCC6, BRCA2, BRCA1, XPC, JAG1, RPA1, POLE, ATM, and LIG1 in African American men, and POLQ, NEIL3, POLB, BRCA2, EXO1, ERCC6, ATR, RBBP8, BRCA1, ATM, JAG1, XPC, and POLE in Caucasians. We found that 89% of tumors had at least one mutation in nucleotide excision repair pathway genes in African Americans, whereas >40% of tumors had mutations in base excision repair pathway genes in Caucasians. We further identified a marginal increase in mutation rate in tumors in African Americans with increasing age. Tumors in Caucasians did not show a correlation with age, but a progressive increase in the mutation rate was observed at higher Gleason scores. Our data reveal significant differences in the molecular signatures in the DNA repairome in prostate cancer between African Americans and Caucasians.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant immune cell population within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Systematic investigation of the interaction and network signaling between PCSCs and TAMs may help in searching for the critical target to suppress PCSCs and metastasis. Herein, we demonstrated that TAMs-secreted CCL5 could significantly promote the migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of prostate cancer cells as well as the self-renewal of PCSCs in vitro. QPCR screening validated STAT3 as the most significant response gene in prostate cancer cells following CCL5 treatment. RNA-sequencing and mechanistic explorations further revealed that CCL5 could promote PCSCs self-renewal and prostate cancer metastasis via activating the β-catenin/STAT3 signaling. Notably, CCL5 knockdown in TAMs not only significantly suppressed prostate cancer xenografts growth and bone metastasis but also inhibited the self-renewal and tumorigenicity of PCSCs in vivo. Finally, clinical investigations and bioinformatic analysis suggested that high CCL5 expression was significantly correlated with high Gleason grade, poor prognosis, metastasis as well as increased PCSCs activity in prostate cancer patients. Taken together, TAMs/CCL5 could promote PCSCs self-renewal and prostate cancer metastasis via activating β-catenin/STAT3 signaling.

Results:   A total of 25 patients were enrolled: 22 were evaluable, and 3 were excluded before receiving cabozantinib. At 12 weeks, 17 (77%) of 22 patients had stable disease or better. The median time on treatment was 24 weeks (range, 3-112 weeks). The overall median progression-free survival was 43.7 weeks (95% confidence interval, 23.7-97.0 weeks). Eight (36%) of 22 patients had markedly reduced uptake on bone scan. Patients with significant response on bone scan had higher bone morphogenic protein-2 levels at baseline, stable N-telopeptides levels, increased vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 expression, and a trend towards increased phospho-CMET while on cabozantinib compared with patients with stable disease.

Here we tested the use of the phi assay in standard clinical practice to pre-select men at the highest risk of harbouring significant cancer and hence refine the use of mpMRI and biopsies.  Methods:   A prospective five-centre study recruited men being investigated through an mpMRI-based prostate cancer diagnostic pathway. Test statistics for PSA, PSA density (PSAd) and phi were assessed for detecting significant cancers using 2 definitions: ≥ Grade Group (GG2) and ≥ Cambridge Prognostic Groups (CPG) 3. Cost modelling and decision curve analysis (DCA) was simultaneously performed.  Results:   A total of 545 men were recruited and studied with a median age, PSA and phi of 66 years, 8.0 ng/ml and 44 respectively. Overall, ≥ GG2 and ≥ CPG3 cancer detection rates were 64% (349/545), 47% (256/545) and 32% (174/545) respectively. There was no difference across centres for patient demographics or cancer detection rates. The overall area under the curve (AUC) for predicting ≥ GG2 cancers was 0.70 for PSA and 0.82 for phi. AUCs for ≥ CPG3 cancers were 0.81 and 0.87 for PSA and phi respectively. AUC values for phi did not differ between centres suggesting reliability of the test in different diagnostic settings. Pre-referral phi cut-offs between 20 and 30 had NPVs of 0.85-0.90 for ≥ GG2 cancers and 0.94-1.0 for ≥ CPG3 cancers. A strategy of mpMRI in all and biopsy only positive lesions reduced unnecessary biopsies by 35% but missed 9% of ≥ GG2 and 5% of ≥ CPG3 cancers. Using PH ≥ 30 to rule out referrals missed 8% and 5% of ≥ GG2 and ≥ CPG3 cancers (and reduced unnecessary biopsies by 40%). This was achieved however with 25% fewer mpMRI. Pathways incorporating PSAd missed fewer cancers but necessitated more unnecessary biopsies. The phi strategy had the lowest mean costs with DCA demonstrating net clinical benefit over a range of thresholds.  Conclusion:   phi as a triaging test may be an effective way to reduce mpMRI and biopsies without compromising detection of significant prostate cancers.""","""['Lois Kim', 'Nicholas Boxall', 'Anne George', 'Keith Burling', 'Pete Acher', 'Jonathan Aning', 'Stuart McCracken', 'Toby Page', 'Vincent J Gnanapragasam']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Med""","""['Multiparametric MRI to improve detection of prostate cancer compared with transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy alone: the PROMIS study.', 'The predictive value of the prostate health index vs. multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for prostate cancer diagnosis in prostate biopsy.', 'Performance of prostate health index and PSA density in a diverse biopsy-naïve cohort with mpMRI for detecting significant prostate cancer.', 'Can Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Be Detected with Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging?

Not only can PLND provide accurate clinical staging to guide treatment after prostatectomy but PLND can also improve the prognosis of patients by eradicating micro-metastases. However, reports of the number of pelvic lymph nodes have generally come from incomplete dissection during surgery, there is no anatomic study that assesses the number and variability of lymph nodes. Our objective is to assess the utility of adopting the lymph node count as a metric of surgical quality for the extent of lymph node dissection during RP for prostate cancer by conducting a dissection study of pelvic lymph nodes in adult male cadavers.  Methods:   All 30 adult male cadavers underwent pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND), and the lymph nodes in each of the 9 dissection zones were enumerated and analyzed.  Results:   A total of 1267 lymph nodes were obtained. The number of lymph nodes obtained by limited PLND was 4-22 (14.1 ± 4.5), the number obtained by standard PLND was 16-35 (25.9 ± 5.6), the number obtained by extended PLND was 17-44 (30.0 ± 7.0), and the number obtained by super-extended PLDN was 24-60 (42.2 ± 9.7).  Conclusions:   There are substantial inter-individual differences in the number of lymph nodes in the pelvic cavity. These results have demonstrated the rationality and feasibility of adopting lymph node count as a surrogate for evaluating the utility of PLND in radical prostatectomy, but these results need to be further explored.""","""['Jia-Jun Chen', 'Zai-Sheng Zhu', 'Yi-Yi Zhu', 'Hong-Qi Shi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Pelvic lymph node dissection in prostate cancer.', 'Reconsidering the role of pelvic lymph node dissection with radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer in an era of improving radiological staging techniques.', 'Indication for and extension of pelvic lymph node dissection during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: an analysis of five European institutions.', 'Anatomic basis for lymph node counts as measure of lymph node dissection extent: a cadaveric study.', 'Pelvic lymph node dissection during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: efficacy, limitations, and complications-a systematic review of the literature.', 'Influence of lymph node degeneration on metastases in prostate cancer: or why we must look for a needle in a haystack.', 'Identifying the Candidates Who Will Benefit From Extended Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection at Radical Prostatectomy Among Patients With Prostate Cancer.', 'Pelvic Lymphadenectomy in Gynecologic Oncology-Significance of Anatomical Variations.']"""

Methods and materials:   National Medicare claims from January 1, 2011, through December 31, 2014, were analyzed to identify newly diagnosed prostate cancers. Three ""radical treatment"" cohorts were identified (prostatectomy, brachytherapy, and stereotactic body radiation therapy [SBRT]) and matched to an active surveillance (AS) cohort by using inverse probability treatment weighting via propensity score. Total costs at 1 year after biopsy were calculated for each cohort, and treatment-specific costs were estimated by subtracting total 1-year costs in each radical treatment group from those in the AS group.  Results:   Mean 1-year adjusted costs were highest among patients receiving SBRT ($26,895), lower for prostatectomy ($23,632), and lowest for brachytherapy ($19,980), whereas those for AS were $9687. Costs of radical modalities varied significantly by region, with the Mid-Atlantic and New England regions having the highest cost ranges (>$10,000) and the West South Central and Mountain regions the lowest range in costs (<$2000). Quantification of toxic effects showed that prostatectomy was associated with higher genitourinary incontinence (hazard ratio [HR] = 10.8 compared with AS) and sexual dysfunction (HR = 3.5), whereas the radiation modalities were associated with higher genitourinary irritation/bleeding (brachytherapy HR = 1.7; SBRT HR = 1.5) and gastrointestinal ulcer/stricture/fistula (brachytherapy HR = 2.7; SBRT HR = 3.0). Overall mean toxicity costs were highest among patients treated with prostatectomy ($3500) followed by brachytherapy ($1847), SBRT ($1327), and AS ($1303).

The purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate the role of Wnt ligands gene family in biochemical recurrence in prostate adenocarcinoma. RNA-seq transcriptome data and clinicopathological data of 489 prostate adenocarcinoma tissues and 51 nontumor tissues were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We developed a risk score model with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Cox regression algorithm. We used the X-tile program to derive the best threshold for risk scores, dividing patients into high-, intermediate-, and low-risk groups. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed. Nomogram was constructed based on the risk score and clinical features. The risk score = (0.192 × expression level of Wnt9A) + (0.732 × expression level of Wnt8B) + (0.051 × expression level of Wnt7B) + (-0.320 × expression level of Wnt3A). The risk score was an independent prognostic factor, with a hazard ratio of 1.298 (95% confidence interval: 1.046-1.612; p = 0.018). GSEA revealed that the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway of the four selected genes was closely related to malignancy-related biological processes. Nomogram was constructed based on the risk score and clinical features. The C index was 0.719, and the calibration curve showed that the nomogram performed well. In general, we comprehensively evaluated the association between Wnt ligands gene family and biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer. We developed a risk score model based on messenger RNA expression levels of several selected Wnt ligand family genes (Wnt3A, Wnt7B, Wnt8B, and Wnt9A), which was significantly associated with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.

In this study, we analyzed the geographic variation of colorectal, breast and prostate cancer screening utilization in Switzerland and the influence of available guidelines and different modifiers of access. Colonoscopy, mammography and prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing use in eligible population in 2014 was assessed with administrative claims data. We ran a multilevel multivariable logistic regression model and calculated Moran's I and regional level median odds ratio (MOR) statistics to explore residual geographic variation. In total, an estimated 8.1% of eligible persons received colonoscopy, 22.3% mammography and 31.3% PSA testing. Low deductibles, supplementary health insurance and enrollment in a managed care plan were associated with higher screening utilization. Cantonal breast cancer screening programs were also associated with higher utilization. Spatial clustering was observed in the raw regional utilization of all services, but only for prostate cancer screening in regional residuals of the multilevel model. MOR was highest for prostate cancer screening (1.24) and lowest for colorectal cancer screening (1.16). The reasons for the variation of the prostate cancer screening utilization, not recommended routinely without explicit shared decision-making, could be further investigated by adding provider characteristics and patient preference information.

The goal was to characterize androgen receptor gene (AR) amplifications and mutations detected in ctDNA from patients with PCa and to further understand the somatic genetic heterogeneity of advanced prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   This study included a heterogeneous group of 892 patients with advanced PCa (predominantly castrate-resistant prostate cancer) with AR alterations detected in ctDNA that underwent next-generation sequencing of 54 to 73 genes via Guardant360 testing (Guardant Health, Inc., Redwood City, CA). Distribution and summary of AR alterations detected, the association of AR alterations with other genes, and a pathway analysis are reported.  Results:   The median absolute plasma copy number of AR amplifications was 3.3 (range, 1.2-165.2). Many patients had multiple AR mutations; a total of 112 unique mutations were identified in AR, including L702H (25%), T878A (14%), H875Y (11%), W742C (8%), W742L (4%), F877L (2%), and T878S (2%). Other ctDNA gene alterations in the Guardant assays included TP53 (50%), MYC (34%), BRAF (32%), PIK3CA (29%), MET (25%), CDK6 (26%), EGFR (24%), FGFR1 (21%), and APC (12%). Many of these non-AR alterations are not tissue verified in other studies. AR amplification cosegregated with alterations in MYC (p < .001), BRAF (p < .001), PIK3CA (p < .001), MET (p < .001), CDK6 (p < .001), EGFR (p < .001), FGFR1 (p = .391), and more. Alterations in APC were significantly associated with mutations in AR (p < .001).  Conclusion:   Several AR alterations and concomitant non-AR alterations that associate with drug resistance were detected. These findings provide additional insights into the heterogeneity of advanced prostate cancer.  Implications for practice:   The goal was to characterize androgen receptor gene (AR) amplifications and mutations detected in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from patients with prostate cancer in relation to non-AR gene alterations detected in the ctDNA landscape.

In mid-2018, the US Preventive Service Task Force recommended shared decision making (SDM) before PSA-based prostate cancer screening among men aged 55-69 year while remained against PSA testing in men aged 70 or older. The objective of this study is to examine recent changes in SDM and prostate cancer screening following recent USPSTF recommendations.  Methods:   A retrospective cross-sectional study among men aged 50 years or older were conducted using 2015 and 2018 National Health Interview Survey data (n = 10,926). Outcomes included self-reported PSA testing for prostate cancer screening last year, and if yes, whether respondent ever had a discussion with the healthcare provider about its advantages and disadvantages. Analyses were stratified by respondent's age (50-54 vs. 55-69 vs. 70+).  Results:   Routine PSA screening rates remained stable from 34.3% in 2015 to 35.4% in first half of 2018, and 36.0% in second half of 2018 (p trend = 0.57). A similar pattern was found in men ≥70 years (p trend = 0.98).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association of rs16901979, rs4242382 and rs1447295 on 8q24 locus, rs2735839 (KLK3 gene) and rs721048 (EHBP1 gene) with prostate adenocarcinoma through multi-stage approach to identify the polymorphisms associated with prostate cancer and use them as screening factors. Screening tests can identify people who may have a chance of developing the disease before detection and any symptoms.  Methods:   The case-control study included 103 cases (prostate adenocarcinoma) and 100 controls (benign prostatic hyperplasia). Tetra-primer ARMS-PCR was used to genotyping of each participant. A Multi-stage approach was used for efficient genomic study. In this method, a smaller number of people can be used. Chi-squared, Fisher's exact test and logistic regression were used to investigate the SNPs associated with prostate cancer and Gleason score.  Results:   In the first stage (59 men), the frequency of polymorphisms rs16901979, rs4242382, rs1447295, rs2735839 and rs721048 in the prostate adenocarcinoma group was evaluated compared to the control group (P-value < 0.3) in order to select meaningful polymorphisms. There was not any significant difference between genotype frequency rs16901979 (P = 0.671) and rs721048 (P = 0.474) in the case group compared to BPH. Therefore, these polymorphisms were eliminated, and in the second step (144 men), rs4242382, rs2735839 and rs1447295 were evaluated (P-value < 0.05). According to the total population (203 men), there was significant difference between genotype frequency rs4242382 (P = 0.001), rs2735839 (P = 0.000) and rs1447295 (P = 0.005) even after using Bonferroni correction (p = 0.016). The effect of these three polymorphisms on prostate cancer was not modified by age and PSA. There was a significant difference between the allelic frequency of A vs G (rs4242382, rs2735839) at all classes of Gleason score and A vs C (rs1447295) at Gleason score ≥ 8.  Conclusions:   The results of this study for rs2735839, rs4242382 and rs1447295 indicate the association of these polymorphisms with prostate adenocarcinoma predisposition in Iranian population.

In the current study, the authors sought to characterize alterations in DNA repair pathway genes in both primary and metastatic prostate tumors with attention to tissue distribution as well as specific genomic alterations.  Methods:   The authors studied the distribution and type of alterations in 24 genes that are considered important for DNA repair in 944 prostate cancers harvested from localized and metastatic tumors. Tumor DNA underwent hybrid capture for all coding exons of 287 or 395 cancer-related genes plus select introns from 19 or 31 genes frequently rearranged in cancer. Captured libraries were sequenced to a median exon coverage depth of >×500. Specific genomic alterations were characterized and the frequencies of mutations by tissue site (prostate vs metastases) were compared using logistic regression.  Results:   A total of 152 patients from the cohort of 944 men (16%) harbored a germline or somatic mutation in ≥1 DNA repair genes. The most frequently mutated genes were BRCA2 (11.4%) and ATM (5.8%), followed by MSH6 (2.5%) and MSH2 (2.1%). Mutations were identified in approximately 20.1% of primary prostate tumors compared with 18.8% of bone metastases. When stratified by tissue site, the highest rates of DNA repair mutations were found in solid organ metastases, including brain and visceral metastases, compared with prostate.  Conclusions:   DNA repair gene mutations are more common in metastatic than localized prostate tumors.

High-mobility group nucleosome-binding domain 5 (HMGN5) is overexpressed in many cancers and could cause carcinogenesis in BC. By protein-protein-interaction (PPI) analysis, we found that heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27), also a crucial functional factor in BC carcinogenesis, is significantly related to HMGN5. Hsp27 is required for IL-6-mediated EMT via STAT3/Twist signaling in prostate cancer. Here, we hypothesize that HMGN5 may interact with Hsp27 to affect IL-6-induced EMT and invasion in BC via STAT3 signaling. In the present study, we found that HMGN5 and Hsp27 are highly expressed in BC tissues and positively correlated with each other. HMGN5 interacts with Hsp27 in vitro, to modulate the cell invasion and EMT in BC. Moreover, HMGN5 could modulate IL-6-Hsp27-induced EMT and invasion in BC cells by regulating STAT3 phosphorylation and STAT3 targeting of the Twist promoter.

The Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) helps provide a standardized probabilistic approach for identifying clinically significant prostate cancer. Despite widespread use, the variability in performance of prostate MRI across practices remains unknown. Purpose To estimate the positive predictive value (PPV) of PI-RADS for the detection of high-grade prostate cancer across imaging centers. Materials and Methods This retrospective cross-sectional study was compliant with the HIPAA. Twenty-six centers with members in the Society of Abdominal Radiology Prostate Cancer Disease-focused Panel submitted data from men with suspected or biopsy-proven untreated prostate cancer. MRI scans were obtained between January 2015 and April 2018. This was followed with targeted biopsy. Only men with at least one MRI lesion assigned a PI-RADS score of 2-5 were included. Outcome was prostate cancer with Gleason score (GS) greater than or equal to 3+4 (International Society of Urological Pathology grade group ≥2). A mixed-model logistic regression with institution and individuals as random effects was used to estimate overall PPVs. The variability of observed PPV of PI-RADS across imaging centers was described by using the median and interquartile range. Results The authors evaluated 3449 men (mean age, 65 years ± 8 [standard deviation]) with 5082 lesions. Biopsy results showed 1698 cancers with GS greater than or equal to 3+4 (International Society of Urological Pathology grade group ≥2) in 2082 men. Across all centers, the estimated PPV was 35% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 27%, 43%) for a PI-RADS score greater than or equal to 3 and 49% (95% CI: 40%, 58%) for a PI-RADS score greater than or equal to 4. The interquartile ranges of PPV at these same PI-RADS score thresholds were 27%-44% and 27%-48%, respectively. Conclusion The positive predictive value of the Prostate Imaging and Reporting Data System was low and varied widely across centers. © RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

Patients and methods:   A prospective, single-centre paired diagnostic study included 150 biopsy-naïve men, from November 2015 to November 2018. All men underwent pre-biopsy mpMRI and CUDI followed by a 12-core SBx taken by an operator blinded from the imaging results. Men with suspicious lesions on mpMRI and/or CUDI also underwent MRI-TRUS fusion-TBx and/or cognitive CUDI-TBx after SBx by a second operator. A non-inferiority analysis of the mpMRI- and CUDI-TBx strategies in comparison with SBx for International Society of Urological Pathology Grade Group [GG] ≥2 PCa in any core with a non-inferiority margin of 1 percentage point was performed. Additional analyses for GG ≥2 PCa with cribriform growth pattern and/or intraductal carcinoma (CR/IDC), and GG ≥3 PCa were performed. Differences in detection rates were tested using McNemar's test with adjusted Wald confidence intervals.  Results:   After enrolment of 150 men, an interim analysis was performed. Both the mpMRI- and CUDI-TBx strategies were inferior to SBx for GG ≥2 PCa detection and the study was stopped. SBx found significantly more GG ≥2 PCa: 39% (56/142), as compared with 29% (41/142) and 28% (40/142) for mpMRI-TBx and CUDI-TBx, respectively (P < 0.05). SBx found significantly more GG = 1 PCa: 14% (20/142) compared to 1% (two of 142) and 3% (four of 142) with mpMRI-TBx and CUDI-TBx, respectively (P < 0.05). Detection of GG ≥2 PCa with CR/IDC and GG ≥3 PCa did not differ significantly between the strategies. The mpMRI- and CUDI-TBx strategies were comparable in detection but the mpMRI-TBx strategy had less false-positive findings (18% vs 53%).  Conclusions:   In our study in biopsy-naïve men, the mpMRI- and CUDI-TBx strategies had comparable PCa detection rates, but the mpMRI-TBX strategy had the least false-positive findings.

Transperineal Prostate Biopsies Using Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Fusion and Micro-Ultrasound Guided Biopsies""","""Purpose:   We assessed the prostate cancer detection accuracy of transperineal prostate biopsy using multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy and micro-ultrasound during the same procedure. Micro-ultrasound is a new high-resolution imaging system that allows real-time targeted biopsy.  Materials and methods:   A total of 194 consecutive patients underwent transperineal prostate biopsies using real-time targeted micro-ultrasound (ExactVu™) and ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy (BiopSee®) in the same procedure, from February 2018 to September 2019. Biopsies were performed using a transperineal needle guide attached to the 29 MHz high-resolution micro-ultrasound transducer.  Results:   The overall positive rate was 56% (108) for prostate cancer and 42% (81) for clinically significant prostate cancer (Gleason Grade Group greater than 1), and adding micro-ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging detected significantly more clinically significant prostate cancer than systematic biopsy (p <0.001). Micro-ultrasound found 12 of 108 (11%) prostate cancers that were missed by all other techniques and 11 (92%) were clinically significant prostate cancer. PI-RADS® and PRI-MUS™ (Prostate Risk Identification Using Micro-Ultrasound) were strong predictors of clinically significant prostate cancer in a logistic regression model (AUC 0.76). For prostate specific antigen greater than 4 ng/ml, PI-RADS greater than 3, there was an improvement in detection rate between PRI-MUS 4 and PRI-MUS 5 (52% Gleason Grade Group greater than 1 to 92% Gleason Grade Group greater than 1). No fever or clinical infection was observed and 17 (8.7%) patients presented with minor complications (Clavien Dindo I).  Conclusions:   This is the first study using a transperineal approach for micro-ultrasound guided biopsy and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging fusion biopsy. The results show a high accuracy for prostate cancer and clinically significant prostate cancer diagnosis, without infectious complications. The proposed method should be validated in large randomized clinical trials.""","""['Moises Elias Rodríguez Socarrás#', 'Juan Gomez Rivas#', 'Vanesa Cuadros Rivera', 'Javier Reinoso Elbers', 'Luis Llanes González', 'Ivan Michel Mercado', 'Julio Fernandez Del Alamo', 'Pablo Juarez Del Dago', 'Fernando Gomez Sancha']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Editorial Comment.', 'Comparison of Initial Experience with Transrectal Magnetic Resonance Imaging Cognitive Guided Micro-Ultrasound Biopsies versus Established Transperineal Robotic Ultrasound Magnetic Resonance Imaging Fusion Biopsies for Prostate Cancer.', 'Comparative analysis of transperineal template saturation prostate biopsy versus magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy with magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion guidance.', 'Accuracy of Transperineal Targeted Prostate Biopsies, Visual Estimation and Image Fusion in Men Needing Repeat Biopsy in the PICTURE Trial.', 'Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Ultrasound Fusion Targeted Biopsy: A Systematic Review.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Ultrasound Fusion-guided Transperineal Versus Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Ultrasound Fusion-guided Transrectal Prostate Biopsy-A Systematic Review.', 'The diagnostic accuracy of micro-ultrasound for prostate cancer diagnosis: a review.', 'Diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of micro-ultrasound guided biopsies in patients with suspected prostate cancer.', 'Micro-Ultrasound: Current Role in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis and Future Possibilities.', 'Assessing the Role of High-resolution Microultrasound Among Naïve Patients with Negative Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging and a Persistently High Suspicion of Prostate Cancer.', 'Multiparametric ultrasound of prostate: role in prostate cancer diagnosis.']"""

Using single-cell transcriptomics and ex vivo profiling, we have uncovered the critical role of tumor-intrinsic immune signaling in the retention of cancer cell dormancy. We demonstrate that loss of tumor-intrinsic type I IFN occurs in proliferating prostate cancer cells in bone. This loss suppresses tumor immunogenicity and therapeutic response and promotes bone cell activation to drive cancer progression. Restoration of tumor-intrinsic IFN signaling by HDAC inhibition increased tumor cell visibility, promoted long-term antitumor immunity, and blocked cancer growth in bone. Key findings were validated in patients, including loss of tumor-intrinsic IFN signaling and immunogenicity in bone metastases compared to primary tumors.

Cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1) is a key UPEC toxin; however, its role in bladder cancer is unknown. In the present study, we found CNF1 induced bladder cancer cells to secrete vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) through activating Ras homolog family member C (RhoC), leading to subsequent angiogenesis in the bladder cancer microenvironment. We then investigated that CNF1-mediated RhoC activation modulated the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) to upregulate the VEGF. We demonstrated in vitro that active RhoC increased heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) phosphorylation, which induced the heat shock protein 90α (HSP90α) expression, leading to stabilization of HIF1α. Active RhoC elevated HSP90α, HIF1α, VEGF expression, and angiogenesis in the human bladder cancer xenografts. In addition, HSP90α, HIF1α, and VEGF expression were also found positively correlated with the human bladder cancer development.

PTTG1 immunostaining was largely absent in normal prostate epithelial cells. In cancers, staining was considered weak in 5.4%, moderate in 5.6% and strong in 0.8%. Strong staining was linked to advanced pT stage, high classical and quantitative Gleason grade, high Ki67-labeling index (all P < 0.0001) and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.0083). The prognostic impact of PTTG1 expression was independent of established preoperative and postoperative prognostic features. Comparison with molecular features revealed that PTTG1 upregulation was associated with nine of 12 common genomic deletions (P < 0.05), p53 alterations and high androgen receptor levels (P < 0.001 each), but was unrelated to the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion status.

Results:   Two hundred twenty-three (223) consecutive patients were enrolled: median PSA = 0.65 ng/mL (0.2-8.9) and median PSAdt = 9.3 months (0.4-144.6). 96.9% received RP as primary therapy. 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET/CT positivity rate was 39.9% (CI95% 33.5-46.7%). Disease confined to pelvis was detected in 23.3% of cases. At least one distant lesion was observed in 16.6% of cases. Secondary objectives are as follows: (1) changes in clinical management were observed in 34.5% of patients; (2) PSA, PSAdt and T stage > 3a were independent predictors (all p < 0.03); (3) 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET/CT positivity rate was 56% (in group 1, 36.3% in group 2, 40.3% in group 3.  Conclusion:   This study attested the overall good performance of 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET/CT to detect PCa locations in HSPC patients eligible for salvage therapy, influencing the therapy management in 35.4% of cases.

Tumor heterogeneity and evolution contribute to cancer resistance and pose challenges for cancer therapy due to differential genomic rearrangement and expression driving distinct tumor responses to treatments. Here we report that intratumor heterogeneity of Wnt/β-catenin modulator δ-catenin controls individual cell behavior to promote cancer. The differential intratumor subcellular localization of δ-catenin mirrors its compartmentalization in prostate cancer xenograft cultures as result of mutation-rendered δ-catenin truncations. Wild-type and δ-catenin mutants displayed distinct protein interactomes that highlight rewiring of signal networks. Localization specific δ-catenin mutants influenced p120ctn-dependent Rho GTPase phosphorylation and shifted cells towards differential bFGF-responsive growth and motility, a known signal to bypass androgen receptor dependence. Mutant δ-catenin promoted Myc-induced prostate tumorigenesis while increasing bFGF-p38 MAP kinase signaling, β-catenin-HIF-1α expression, and the nuclear size. Therefore, intratumor δ-catenin heterogeneity originated from genetic remodeling promotes prostate cancer expansion towards androgen independent signaling, supporting a neomorphism model paradigm for targeting tumor progression.""","""['Mingchuan Li#', 'Jongdee Nopparat#', 'Byron J Aguilar', 'Yan-Hua Chen', 'Jiao Zhang', 'Jie Du', 'Xin Ai', 'Yong Luo', 'Yongguang Jiang', 'Christi Boykin', 'Qun Lu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['δ-Catenin, a Wnt/β-catenin modulator, reveals inducible mutagenesis promoting cancer cell survival adaptation and metabolic reprogramming.', 'δ-Catenin promotes E-cadherin processing and activates β-catenin-mediated signaling: implications on human prostate cancer progression.', 'δ-Catenin overexpression promotes angiogenic potential of CWR22Rv-1 prostate cancer cells via HIF-1α and VEGF.', 'Dancing in and out of the nucleus: p120(ctn) and the transcription factor Kaiso.', 'Androgen receptor and prostate cancer stem cells: biological mechanisms and clinical implications.', 'Intratumor heterogeneity is associated with less CD8+ T cell infiltration and worse survival in patients with small cell lung cancer.', 'Genetic profiling of hormone-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancers and identification of genetic mutations prone to castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Delta-catenin attenuates medulloblastoma cell invasion by targeting EMT pathway.', 'Delta-Catenin as a Modulator of Rho GTPases in Neurons.', 'bFGF-mediated phosphorylation of δ-catenin increases its protein stability and the ability to induce the nuclear redistribution of β-catenin.']"""

However, high-grade prostate and urothelial carcinomas sometimes show significant morphologic and immunohistochemical overlap, which can result in misdiagnosis and mistreatment. This diagnostic dilemma is particularly acute in patients previously treated with radiation and/or hormone therapy for prostate cancer, who later present with high-grade carcinoma in the urinary bladder. To address the diagnostic utility of integrated immunohistochemical and molecular analysis in this setting, we evaluated 25 high-grade carcinomas of the bladder for which morphologic features were deemed indeterminate. Our analysis included immunohistochemistry for urothelial markers (GATA3, p63, uroplakin II), prostate markers (NKX3.1, prostate specific antigen, P501S), androgen receptor (AR) and ERG, along with molecular characterization using capture-based next generation DNA sequencing. Immunohistochemical findings were concordant with the final integrated diagnosis in 21 (84%) cases. However, in three (12%) cases, immunohistochemistry supported a diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma, but molecular analysis identified the correct diagnosis of prostate cancer based on the presence of a TMPRSS2-ERG fusion. One case remained unclassifiable even after this integrated analysis. Notably, in 1 of 21 cases, the presence of a TERT promoter mutation and the absence of a TMPRSS2-ERG fusion would typically favor a diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma, but the aggregate immunohistochemical and molecular findings instead supported a diagnosis of microsatellite unstable prostatic adenocarcinoma with deep deletion of MSH2 and MSH6. Our findings highlight the importance of considering prostatic origin in high-grade carcinoma of the urinary bladder of patients with a history of treated prostate cancer, even when the immunohistochemical findings favor urothelial carcinoma. In a subset of cases, an approach that integrates immunophenotypic and molecular data may help correctly assign site of origin and prevent misdiagnosis that can result from overreliance on any individual immunohistochemical or molecular result.""","""['Emily Chan', 'Karuna Garg', 'Bradley A Stohr']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mod Pathol""","""['Pseudopapillary features in prostatic adenocarcinoma mimicking urothelial carcinoma: a diagnostic pitfall.', 'Immunohistochemical differentiation of high-grade prostate carcinoma from urothelial carcinoma.', 'Evaluation of contemporary prostate and urothelial lineage biomarkers in a consecutive cohort of poorly differentiated bladder neck carcinomas.', 'Immunohistochemical Pitfalls in Genitourinary Pathology: 2018 Update.', 'Clear cell urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder: a case report and review of the literature.', 'Molecular characterization of adenocarcinomas arising in the urinary bladder following augmentation cystoplasty: a multi-institutional study.', 'Curative resection of bladder cancer with pancreas head metastasis.']"""

However, this surrogate only holds true for a select subset of patients, and leaves those trials analyzing metastatic disease at a disadvantage. We aimed to identify the best surrogate for predicting OS in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive PC.  Methods:   We analyzed data from the Chemohormonal Therapy versus Androgen Ablation Randomized Trial for Extensive Disease trial in which patients were randomly assigned to receive either androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) or ADT plus docetaxel. PSA response, progression and development of castration-resistant PC (CRPC) within 6 and 12 months were investigated as potential OS surrogates, in accordance with the Prentice Criteria. The proportion the of treatment effect (PTE) was calculated for each surrogate and used to identify the best one.  Results:   Data from 790 patients were considered: 393 (49.7%) men received ADT alone, while 397 (50.3%) received combination therapy.

FDA-approved enzalutamide is commonly prescribed for CRPC which works by blocking androgen receptor function. However, even after initial good response, enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer (ERPC) develops which eventually leads to widespread metastasis. Management of ERPC is extremely difficult because available therapeutic regimen cannot effectively kill and eliminate ERPC cells. Though the mechanism behind enzalutamide-resistance is not properly understood, over-activation of c-Myc has been found to be a common event which plays an important role in the maintenance and progression of ERPC phenotype. However, direct-targeting of c-Myc poses special problem because of its non-enzymatic nature and certain amount of c-Myc activity is needed by non-cancer cells as well. Thus, c-Myc has emerged as an elusive target which needs to be managed by novel agents and strategies in a cancer-specific way. We investigated the effects of pharmacological and genetic inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (5-Lox) on cell proliferation, apoptosis and invasive potential of enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells. Transcriptional activity of c-Myc was analyzed by DNA-binding, luciferase-assays, and expression of c-Myc-target genes. We found that 5-Lox regulates c-Myc signaling in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells and inhibition of 5-Lox by Quiflapon/MK591 or shRNA interrupts oncogenic c-Myc signaling and kills ERPC cells by triggering caspase-mediated apoptosis. Interestingly, MK591 does not affect normal, non-cancer cells in the same experimental conditions. Our findings indicate that inhibition of 5-Lox may emerge as a promising new approach to effectively kill ERPC cells sparing normal cells and suggest that development of a long-term curative therapy of prostate cancer may be possible by killing and eliminating ERPC cells with suitable 5-Lox-inhibitors.""","""['Jitender Monga', 'Dhatchayini Subramani', 'Ajay Bharathan', 'Jagadananda Ghosh']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase selectively triggers disruption of c-Myc signaling in prostate cancer cells.', 'MK591, a second generation leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitor, prevents invasion and induces apoptosis in the bone-invading C4-2B human prostate cancer cells: implications for the treatment of castration-resistant, bone-metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Wedelolactone, an Anti-inflammatory Botanical, Interrupts c-Myc Oncogenic Signaling and Synergizes with Enzalutamide to Induce Apoptosis in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Small molecules targeting c-Myc oncogene: promising anti-cancer therapeutics.', 'Molecular landscape of c-Myc signaling in prostate cancer: A roadmap to clinical translation.', 'Three-dimensional growth reveals fine-tuning of 5-lipoxygenase by proliferative pathways in cancer.', 'ACSL3 regulates lipid droplet biogenesis and ferroptosis sensitivity in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'Knock-out of 5-lipoxygenase in overexpressing tumor cells-consequences on gene expression and cellular function.', 'Aspalathus linearis suppresses cell survival and proliferation of enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells via inhibition of c-Myc and stability of androgen receptor.', 'Deoxyschizandrin Inhibits the Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion of Bladder Cancer Cells through ALOX5 Regulating PI3K-AKT Signaling Pathway.']"""

Aim:   To determine the association between practice use of urgent referral and cancer stage at diagnosis and cancer patient mortality, for all cancers and the most common types of cancer (colorectal, lung, breast, and prostate).  Design and setting:   National cohort study of 1.4 million patients diagnosed with cancer in England between 2011 and 2015.  Method:   The cohort was stratified according to quintiles of urgent referral metrics. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to quantify risk of death, and logistic regression to calculate odds of late-stage (III/IV) versus early-stage (I/II) cancers in relation to referral quintiles and cancer type.  Results:   Cancer patients from the highest referring practices had a lower hazard of death (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.95 to 0.97), with similar patterns for individual cancers: colorectal (HR = 0.95; CI = 0.93 to 0.97); lung (HR = 0.95; CI = 0.94 to 0.97); breast (HR = 0.96; CI = 0.93 to 0.99); and prostate (HR = 0.88; CI = 0.85 to 0.91). Similarly, for cancer patients from these practices, there were lower odds of late-stage diagnosis for individual cancer types, except for colorectal cancer.  Conclusion:   Higher practice use of referrals for suspected cancer is associated with lower mortality for the four most common types of cancer. A significant proportion of the observed mortality reduction is likely due to earlier stage at diagnosis, except for colorectal cancer.

Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary endpoint of the study was the diagnostic performance of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in detecting malignant lesions and clinically significant PCa (Gleason score [GS] ≥7).  Results and limitations: 68Ga-PSMA PET/transrectal ultrasound fusion biopsy was performed in 64 of 97 patients (66%) for 114 regions of interest (ROIs). Forty patients (41%) had already undergone mpMRI with either a negative result for PCa (n = 15; 22 ROIs) or a positive mpMRI result but a previous negative biopsy. According to pathology, 23 patients (36%) had evidence of PCa: eight (16 ROIs) with GS 6, 13 (21 ROIs) with GS 7 (3 + 4 or 4 + 3), one (2 ROIs) with GS 8, and one (2 ROIs) with GS 10. Clinically significant PCa was identified in four patients with previous negative mpMRI (25%). PET/CT demonstrated PCa in seven patients (14 ROIs) with previous positive mpMRI and negative biopsy. The median maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and median SUV ratio were significantly higher for PCa lesions than for benign lesions (p < 0.001). Optimal cutoff points obtained for SUVmax (>5.4) and SUV ratio (>2.2) could identify clinically significant PCa with accuracy of 81% and 90%, respectively.  Conclusions:   In our cohort of patients with high suspicion of cancer,68Ga-PSMA PET/CT was capable of detecting malignancy and accurately identifying clinically relevant PCa.  Patient summary:   Positron emission tomography/computed tomography with a 68Ga-labeled ligand for prostate-specific membrane antigen is capable of detecting prostate cancer in patients with a high suspicion of cancer and a previous negative biopsy.""","""['Egesta Lopci', 'Giovanni Lughezzani', 'Angelo Castello', 'Alberto Saita', 'Piergiuseppe Colombo', 'Rodolfo Hurle', 'Roberto Peschechera', 'Alessio Benetti', 'Silvia Zandegiacomo', 'Luisa Pasini', 'Paolo Casale', 'Diana Pietro', 'Giulio Bevilacqua', 'Luca Balzarini', 'Nicolò Maria Buffi', 'Giorgio Guazzoni', 'Massimo Lazzeri']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Establishment and prospective validation of an SUVmax cutoff value to discriminate clinically significant prostate cancer from benign prostate diseases in patients with suspected prostate cancer by 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT: a real-world study.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Combined Utility of 68Ga-Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography and Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Predicting Prostate Biopsy Pathology.', 'Diagnostic Performance and Clinical Impact of PSMA PET/CT versus mpMRI in Patients with a High Suspicion of Prostate Cancer and Previously Negative Biopsy: A Prospective Trial (PROSPET-BX).', 'Comparison of 68Ga-labeled Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Ligand Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography for Primary Staging of Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Novel non-MRI imaging techniques for primary diagnosis of prostate cancer: micro-ultrasound, contrast-enhanced ultrasound, elastography, multiparametric ultrasound, and PSMA PET/CT.', 'Incidence of PSMA PET thyroid incidentaloma depends on analysis method and tracer.', 'Assessing the Role of High-resolution Microultrasound Among Naïve Patients with Negative Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging and a Persistently High Suspicion of Prostate Cancer.', 'The Role of 68GaPSMA PET/CT for Clinical Suspicion of Prostate Cancer in Patients with or without Previous Negative Biopsy: A Systematic Review.', 'Prospective evaluation of the role of imaging techniques and TMPRSS2:ERG mutation for the diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer.']"""

Patients and methods:   In this study, were included 380 consecutive patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) after prostate cancer diagnosis and a prebiopsy MRI showing Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PIRADS) score 4 or 5 lesions. All patients underwent systematic biopsies (SB) combined with software-based fusion TB in the 2 centers.

The primary endpoint was the center difference of concordance/upgrading rates between biopsy and RP specimens.  Results:   Pathological features on biopsy and RP specimens were significantly different among centers with more unfavourable disease in center 1. The rate of TB upgrading was 33.6% in center 1 vs. 35.4% (P = 0.860) in center 2. Grading concordance was also comparable among centers (50.0% vs. 47.1%) as well as the SB upgrading rate. Regression analysis did not find any baseline characteristics (Age, prostate-specific antigen, MRI lesions, center) predictive for TB upgrading. These findings were achieved by using fewer TB per lesion in center 1 (2.3 vs. 5.0, P < 0.001), at the expense of more SB cores (14.4 vs. 8.5, P < 0.001). The influence of MRI characteristics (lesion size and number, PIRADS score) on upgrading rates was consistent among centers.

Objective:   To assess whether dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging (DCE) improves accuracy over T2 and diffusion sequences.  Design, setting, and participants:   PROMIS was a multicentre, multireader trial, with, in this part, 497 biopsy-naïve men undergoing standardised 1.5T MP-MRI using T2, diffusion, and DCE, followed by a detailed transperineal prostate mapping (TPM) biopsy at 5 mm intervals. Likert scores of 1-5 for the presence of a significant tumour were assigned in strict sequence, for (1) T2 + diffusion and then (2) T2 + diffusion + dynamic contrast-enhanced images.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   For the primary analysis, the primary PROMIS outcome measure (Gleason score ≥4 + 3 or ≥6 mm maximum cancer length) on TPM was used, and an MRI score of ≥3 was considered positive.  Results and limitations:   Sensitivity without and with DCE was 94% and 95%, specificity 37% and 38%, positive predictive value 51% and 51%, and negative predictive value 90% and 91%, respectively (p > 0.05 in each case). The number of patients avoiding biopsy (scoring 1-2) was similar (123/497 vs 121/497, p = 0.8). The number of equivocal scores (3/5) was slightly higher without DCE (32% vs 28% p = 0.031). The proportion of MRI equivocal (3/5) and positive (4-5) cases showing significant tumours were similar (23% and 71% vs 20% and 69%). No cases of dominant Gleason 4 or higher were missed with DCE, compared with a single case with T2 + diffusion-weighted imaging. No attempt was made to correlate lesion location on MRI and histology, which may be considered a limitation. Radiologists were aware of the patient's prostate-specific antigen.  Conclusions:   Contrast adds little when MP-MRI is used to exclude significant prostate cancer.  Patient summary:   An intravenous injection of contrast may not be necessary when magnetic resonance imaging is used as a test to rule out significant tumours in the prostate.""","""['Ahmed El-Shater Bosaily', 'Elena Frangou', 'Hashim U Ahmed', 'Mark Emberton', 'Shonit Punwani', 'Richard Kaplan', 'Louise C Brown', 'Alex Freeman', 'Charles Jameson', 'Richard Hindley', 'Delia Peppercorn', 'Andrew Thrower', 'Mathias Winkler', 'Tara Barwick', 'Victoria Stewart', 'Nick Burns-Cox', 'Paul Burn', 'Maneesh Ghei', 'Jeevan Kumaradevan', 'Raj Prasad', 'Janice Ash-Miles', 'Iqbal Shergill', 'Sanjay Agarwal', 'Derek Rosario', 'Ferekh Salim', 'Simon Bott', 'Hywel Evans', 'Alastair Henderson', 'Sukanya Ghosh', 'Tim Dudderidge', 'J Smart', 'Ken Tung', 'Alexander Kirkham;PROMIS Group']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Can Biparametric Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging Fulfill its PROMIS?', 'The Added Value of Dynamic Contrast-enhanced Sequences in Prostate MRI.', 'Added value of diffusion-weighted images and dynamic contrast enhancement in multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer in the PICTURE trial.', 'Diagnostic accuracy of biparametric versus multiparametric prostate MRI: assessment of contrast benefit in clinical practice.', 'False Positive Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Phenotypes in the Biopsy-naïve Prostate: Are They Distinct from Significant Cancer-associated Lesions?

IL 6 receptor was used as a biorecognition molecule and successfully immobilized by covalent linkage on the modified ITO electrode. Pyrrole monomer containing epoxy active side group was electropolymerized on the disposable ITO electrode for the first time and used as an immobilization matrix for IL 6 receptor. The designed biosensor fabrication stages were analyzed by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) techniques. For the quantification of IL 6 biomarker, EIS technique was utilized. In addition, the specific immuno-interaction between IL 6 receptor and IL 6 antigen was followed by single frequency impedance (SFI) technique. The resulting biosensor exhibited a linear calibration curve over the 0.02-16 pg/mL IL 6 concentration range, a limit of detection (LOD) of 6.0 fg/mL and a good selectivity against other interference biomarkers. Additionally, an excellent reproducibility, a long storage stability and an acceptable repeatability were found. The proposed impedimetric immunosensor was applied successfully to quantify for the IL 6 biomarker in human serum and it displayed a remarkable response in the real sample analysis with serum samples. In comparison with the commercial ELISA kit, the immunosensor provided a lower LOD and a lower analysis cost. In conclusion, the proposed impedimetric immunosensor could be clinically useful in the early diagnosis of the prostate cancer by detection of the serum samples after only simple dilution with phosphate buffer.""","""['Elif Burcu Aydın']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Talanta""","""['Fabrication of electrochemical immunosensor based on acid-substituted poly(pyrrole) polymer modified disposable ITO electrode for sensitive detection of CCR4 cancer biomarker in human serum.', 'A sensitive and selective approach for detection of IL 1α cancer biomarker using disposable ITO electrode modified with epoxy-substituted polythiophene polymer.', 'A comparison between LP(GMA) and CLP(GMA) polymer composites as an immobilization matrix for biosensing applications: A model immunosensor for IL 1α.', 'A review on impedimetric immunosensors for pathogen and biomarker detection.', 'Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS): Principles, Construction, and Biosensing Applications.', 'A novel electrochemical IL-6 sensor based on Au nanoparticles-modified platinum carbon electrode.', 'Application of Polypyrrole-Based Electrochemical Biosensor for the Early Diagnosis of Colorectal Cancer.', 'Gold Nanoparticles-MWCNT Based Aptasensor for Early Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'Use of Cysteamine and Glutaraldehyde Chemicals for Robust Functionalization of Substrates with Protein Biomarkers-An Overview on the Construction of Biosensors with Different Transductions.', 'Nanomaterials-Based Sensors for Respiratory Viral Detection: A Review.']"""

Hence, this meta-analysis was conducted to clarify its efficacy in mPCa.  Methods:   A comprehensive search of major databases (PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science) was conducted for eligible studies, up to May 2019. The pooled hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was utilized to evaluate the efficacy of LT for mPCa.  Results:   A total of 12 eligible studies with 78,864 participants, containing 28 different comparisons were ultimately enrolled in this article. Our results showed that LT involving radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy (RT) for mPCa was related to enhanced overall survival (OS) (pooled HR =0.53, 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.61, I2=59.7%, P=0.015), decreased cancer-specific mortality (CSM) (pooled HR =0.42, 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.51, I2=63.1%, P=0.004) and lower all-cause mortality (ACM) (pooled HR =0.37, 95% CI: 0.31 to 0.45, I2=49.4%, P=0.115), compared with no local therapy (NLT). In subsequent stratified analysis, RP or RT was respectively linked to longer OS (pooled HR =0.49, 95% CI: 0.44 to 0.54, I2=0.0%, P=0.741; pooled HR =0.64, 95% CI: 0.56 to 0.72, I2=15.4%, P=0.306), lower CSM (pooled HR =0.37, 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.46, I2=35.2%, P=0.187; pooled HR =0.51, 95% CI: 0.42 to 0.63, I2=27.0%, P=0.250) and decreased ACM (pooled HR =0.31, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.40, I2=56.4%, P=0.130; pooled HR =0.44, 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.56, I2=0.0%, P=0.856), compared with NLT.

A major concern is the deformable prostate bed clinical target volume (CTV) and the closely juxtaposed organs-at-risk (OARs). We report a volumetric and dosimetric analysis of kilovoltage cone-beam CT (CBCT) data from the first 18 patients enrolled on a phase II trial of post-prostatectomy SBRT. With instructions on bladder filling and rectal preparation, we hypothesized acceptable CTV coverage while minimal overdosing to OARs could be achieved.  Methods:   All patients received 5 fractions of 6-6.8 Gy to the prostate bed. CBCT were taken prior to and halfway through each fraction. CTV and OARs were contoured for each CBCT. Changes in inter- and intra-fraction volume and dose were calculated. Relative changes in CTV V95%, bladder V32.5 Gy, and rectal V32.5 Gy and V27.5 Gy were evaluated.  Results:   Interfraction CTV volume remained stable, with median change +5.69% (IQR -1.73% to +9.84%). CTV V95% exhibited median change -0.74% (IQR -9.15% to -0.07%). Volumetric and dosimetric changes were minor from interfraction rotation and intrafraction motion. CTV V95% was ≥93% in 13 of 18 (72%) patients; in the remaining five, median change was -14.09% (IQR -16.64% to -13.56%). Interfraction CTV volume change was significantly larger among patients with CTV V95% <93% (+25.04% vs. +2.85%, p = 0.002).  Conclusions:   With specific bladder and rectum filling protocols, CTV underdosing and overdosing to bladder and rectum are avoided in majority of patients.

We investigated the prevalence of receptor expression and the benefit of adjuvant HER-2 directed therapy in the high-risk postoperative setting and explored the clinical utility of sequentially targeting these receptors in the setting of advanced disease.  Materials and methods:   We clinically annotated 95 patients with SGC (excluding adenoid cystic carcinoma) treated at our institution from 2002 to 2019 and recorded AR, HER-2/neu status, and tumor genomic profiling results when available. Clinicopathologic information was then integrated with outcomes.  Results:   Of 95 patients, most had high-risk histologies, with salivary duct carcinoma (SDC) as the most frequent diagnosis (43, 45%). Thirty-five (37%) experienced recurrence (51% SDC). HER-2/neu was positive (1-3+) by immunostaining in 34 of 52 (65%) evaluable cases. There was no difference in survival based on HER-2/neu or AR expression. Nine of 17 (53%) patients with HER-2+ SDC received adjuvant chemoradiation with trastuzumab. Median disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were longer among patients with HER-2/neu 3+ staining tumors who received adjuvant trastuzumab versus those who did not (DFS, 117 vs. 9 months; p = .02; OS, 74 vs. 43 months; p = .02), with no difference among other HER-2/neu subgroups (0-2+). Two of nine (22%) patients treated with adjuvant trastuzumab demonstrated recurrence, both with low HER-2/neu staining intensity (1+). Longer time to recurrence (hazard ratio, 0.94; p = .01) predicted improved outcomes. Both androgen deprivation and HER-2-directed therapies had clinical benefit beyond the first-line metastatic setting, with partial response observed beyond second-line use.  Conclusion:   Although prospective data are lacking, the use of adjuvant trastuzumab in high-risk patients with SGC appears beneficial, particularly among patients with tumors exhibiting HER-2/neu 3+ immunostaining.  Implications for practice:   Results of this study showed an improved disease-free and overall survival in patients treated with adjuvant trastuzumab for high-risk salivary gland cancers with strong HER-2/neu staining intensity.

Herein, we report the feasibility and morbidity of salvage radical prostatectomy (sRP) post-TULSA.Methods: Four patients with biopsy-proven residual cancer following TULSA underwent open retropubic sRP within 39 months of TULSA. Peri-and post-operative morbidity were reported. Detailed histopathologic assessment is reported.Results: Median follow-up was 43 months after sRP. Mean operating times, blood loss, and length of stay were 210 min, 866 ml, and 3.5 days, respectively. Intraoperative finding of some fibrotic reaction of endopelvic and Denonvilliers fascia was characteristic. There were no perioperative complications. Whole-mount pathology sections showed one pT2b and three pT3a, suggesting under-staging pre-TULSA. Location of disease was compatible with persistent cancer mostly in the untreated peripheral safety region. One man received an artificial urinary sphincter. All men experienced erectile dysfunction responsive to treatment. Two patients with positive surgical margins had PSA progression requiring salvage radiation, with one requiring long-term androgen deprivation therapy.Conclusions: RP is a viable and safe salvage option if TULSA fails.

Emerging evidence suggests that beta-adrenergic blockade inhibits CaP progression. However, the association between type of beta-blocker use and risk of incident CaP on initial prostate biopsy has not been investigated in multiethnic populations.  Materials and methods:   A retrospective study of racially/ethnically diverse men (64% African-American and Hispanic), who underwent initial prostate biopsy between 2006 and 2016 in a large healthcare system was performed. Oral use of beta-blocker type was assessed by reviewing active prescriptions within the 5-year period preceding initial biopsy. Patient demographics and clinical factors were collected.  Results:   Of 4,607 men who underwent initial prostate biopsy, 4,516 met criteria and 2,128 had a biopsy positive for CaP; 20% high-risk, 41% intermediate-risk, and 39% low or very-low risk (National Comprehensive Cancer Network classification). Overall, 15% of patients were taking a beta-blocker prior to initial biopsy, with Metoprolol, Atenolol, and Carvedilol accounting for the majority. Of beta-blocker types, Atenolol alone was associated with a 38% reduction in odds of incident CaP (P= 0.01), with a 40% and 54% reduction in risks of National Comprehensive Cancer Network intermediate and high-risk CaP (P = 0.03 and P = 0.03, respectively) compared to men not taking a beta-blocker. Furthermore, longer duration of Atenolol use (3-5 years) was associated with a 54% and 72% reduction in intermediate and high-risk disease, (P = 0.03 and P = 0.03, respectively).

Methods:   This retrospective study involved patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging for prostate cancer who were also assessed for lower urinary tract symptoms. Volumetric segmentations were utilized to derive the in vivo prostatic urethral length and urethral trajectory in coronal and sagittal planes using a piece-wise cubic spline function to derive the angle of the urethra within the prostate. Association of anatomical factors with urinary symptoms was evaluated using ordinal univariable and multivariable logistic regression with IPSS score cutoffs of ≤7, 8-19, and >20 to define mild, moderate, and severe symptoms, respectively.  Results:   A total of 423 patients were included. On univariable analysis, whole prostate volume, transition zone volume, prostatic urethral length, urethral angle, and retrourethral volume were all significantly associated with worse urinary symptoms. On multivariable analysis prostatic urethral length was associated with urinary symptoms with a normalized odds ratio of 1.5 (95% confidence interval 1.0-2.2, p = 0.04). In a subset analysis of patients on alpha blockers, maximal urethral angle, transition zone volume as well as urethral length were all associated with worse urinary symptoms.  Conclusion:   Multiple parameters were associated with worse urinary symptoms on univariable analysis, but only prostatic urethral length was associated with worse urinary symptoms on multivariable analysis.

Yet, it is unclear if a cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) should be performed before each beam to monitor a possible variation of the organs at risk (OARs) fullness, especially in case of recto-prostatic spacer implantation. The present study aimed at assessing the inter- and intra-fraction movements of prostate, bladder and rectum in patients implanted with a hyaluronic acid spacer and undergoing prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).  Methods:   Data about consecutive patients undergoing prostate SBRT were prospectively collected between 2015 and 2019. Inter-and intra-fraction prostate displacements and volume variation of organs at risk (OARs) were assessed with CBCTs.  Results:   Eight patients were included. They underwent prostate SBRT (37.5Gy, 5 fractions of 7.5Gy) guided by prostate gold fiducial markers. Inter-fraction variation of the bladder volume was insignificant. Intra-fraction mean increase of the bladder volume was modest (29 cc) but significant (p < 0.001). Both inter- and intra-fraction variations of the rectum volume were insignificant but for one patient. He had no rectal toxicity. The magnitude of table displacement necessary to match the prostate gold fiducial marker frequently exceeded the CTV/PTV margins (0.4 cm) before the first (35%) and the second arc (15%). Inter- and intra-fraction bladder and rectum volume variations did not correlate with prostate displacement.  Conclusion:   Major prostate position variations were reported. In-room kV fiducial imaging before each arc seems mandatory. Intra-fraction imaging of the OARs appears unnecessary. We suggest that only one CBCT is needed before the first arc.

The secondary aim was to compare tumor volume estimates between MRI segmentation and transperineal template saturation core needle biopsy (TTSB).  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed patients who had undergone mpMRI of the prostate at our institution and who had received TTSB within 190 days of the examination. Seventy-eight cancer lesions with Gleason score of at least 3 + 4 = 7 were manually segmented in T2-weighted images by 3 radiologists and 1 medical student. Twenty lesions were also segmented in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) series. First, 20 volumetric similarity scores were computed to quantify interreader agreement. Second, manually segmented cancer lesion volumes were compared with TTSB-derived estimates by Bland-Altman analysis and Wilcoxon testing.  Results:   Interreader agreement across all readers was only moderate with mean T2 Dice score of 0.57 (95%CI 0.39-0.70), volumetric similarity coefficient of 0.74 (0.48-0.89), and Hausdorff distance of 5.23 mm (3.17-9.32 mm). Discrepancy of volume estimate between MRI and TTSB was increasing with tumor size. Discrepancy was significantly different between tumors with a Gleason score 3 + 4 vs. higher grade tumors (0.66 ml vs. 0.78 ml; p = 0.007). There were no significant differences between T2, ADC, and DCE segmentations.  Conclusions:   We found at best moderate interreader agreement of manual prostate cancer segmentation in mpMRI. Additionally, our study suggests a systematic discrepancy between the tumor volume estimate by MRI segmentation and TTSB core length, especially for large and high-grade tumors.  Key points:   • Manual prostate cancer segmentation in mpMRI shows moderate interreader agreement. • There are no significant differences between T2, ADC, and DCE segmentation agreements. • There is a systematic difference between volume estimates derived from biopsy and MRI.""","""['Marc R Liechti', 'Urs J Muehlematter', 'Aurelia F Schneider', 'Daniel Eberli', 'Niels J Rupp', 'Andreas M Hötker', 'Olivio F Donati', 'Anton S Becker']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Intra- and interreader reproducibility of PI-RADSv2: A multireader study.', 'Transperineal magnetic resonance image targeted prostate biopsy versus transperineal template prostate biopsy in the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of Prostate MRI Lesion Segmentation Agreement Between Multiple Radiologists and a Fully Automatic Deep Learning System.', 'What Is the Negative Predictive Value of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Excluding Prostate Cancer at Biopsy?

Methods:   The LNCaP cells were treated with androgen (Methyltrienolone, R1881, 5 nmol/L) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 24 h, and then labeled with alkynyl palmitic acid Alk-C16 (100 μmol/L). After that, the cells were collected, lysed, the total protein was extracted, agarose beads labeled with azide (1 mmol/L) were added, and the click-chemistry reaction was carried out at room temperature for 1 h. The covalent bond formed by click-chemistry reaction of azide and alkynyl group was used to enrich the palmitoylated proteins on agarose beads. Label-free quantitation (LFQ) was used to compare the protein palmitoylation level of R1881 treated and untreated cells to screen the proteins induced by androgen at palmitoylation modification level.  Results:   In this experiment, 907 potential palmitoylated proteins (mascot score>2, P<0.05) were identified, among which 430 proteins had LFQ values not zero at least twice.

We also used the software of cytoscape to classify the 92 proteins, and found that the known functional proteins of them could be divided into three categories: metabolism related, protein folding related and translation initiation related. Among them, metabolism related proteins included lipid metabolism (6), glucose metabolism (7) and respiratory electron transport chain (8), and a small amount of amino acid metabolism (2) and other metabolism related proteins (2). Notably, the ratio of LFQ of cytochrome b-c1 complex subunit 2 (UQCRC2) was significantly (>3-fold, P<0.05) higher in androgen-treated cells compared with untreated cells, indicating that the palmitoylation level of UQCRC2 was enhanced by androgen most significantly than that of others. The second was long-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase (ACADVL) related to lipid metabolism and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (PGD) related to glucose metabolism, but the LFQ ratio of them was less than 3-fold.

Gleason Scores (GSs) are assigned to the 12 prostatic regions of each patient. Two classification tasks: benign vs. malignant and low- vs. high-grade, are conducted and the classification results of different prostatic regions are compared. For benign vs. malignant classification, the three-player minimax game framework achieves an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC) of 93.4%, a sensitivity of 95.1% and a specificity of 87.7%, respectively, representing significant improvements of 5.0%, 3.9%, and 6.0% compared to those of using heterogeneous data, which confirms its effectiveness in terms of PCa classification.""","""['Yanan Shao', 'Jane Wang', 'Brian Wodlinger', 'Septimiu E Salcudean']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Med Imaging""","""['Improving prostate cancer classification in H&E tissue micro arrays using Ki67 and P63 histopathology.', 'Automated multiparametric localization of prostate cancer based on B-mode, shear-wave elastography, and contrast-enhanced ultrasound radiomics.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.', 'TRUSformer: improving prostate cancer detection from micro-ultrasound using attention and self-supervision.', 'Robotically controlled three-dimensional micro-ultrasound for prostate biopsy guidance.', 'A review of artificial intelligence in prostate cancer detection on imaging.']"""

Design, settings and participants:   Patient samples from the MiCheck-01 trial were used for development of the MiCheck test.  Methods:   Serum analyte concentrations for cellular growth factors were determined using a custom-made Luminex-based R&D Systems multianalyte kit.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Bayesian model averaging and random forest approaches were used to identify clinical factors and growth factors able to distinguish between men with AgCaP (Gleason Score [GS] ≥3+4) from those with non-AgCaP (GS 3+3). Logistic regression and Monte Carlo cross-validation identified variable combinations in order to able to maximize differentiation of AgCaP from non-AgCaP.  Results:   The MiCheck logistic regression model was developed and comprises the following variables: serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), patient age, Digital Rectal Exam (DRE) status, Leptin, IL-7, vascular endothelial growth factor, and Glypican-1. The model differentiated AgCaP from non-AgCaP with an area under the curve of 0.83 and was superior to PSA, %free PSA and PHI in all patient groups, regardless of PSA range.

Overall, an estimated 365,367 (0.4%) individuals had a gastrointestinal cancer while 2,015,724 (2.1%) had lung, breast, or prostate cancer. Mean adjusted total health expenditures was greater among patients with gastrointestinal cancer ($13,716; 95% confidence interval, $9,805-$17,628) versus patients with nongastrointestinal cancer ($8,665; 95% confidence interval, $8,222-$9,108) or individuals without cancer ($5,807; 95% confidence interval $5,740-$5,874). An estimated 15.8% (n = 57,898) and 7.1% (n = 25,956) of patients with gastrointestinal cancer experienced a high and catastrophic financial burden, respectively. Patients with gastrointestinal cancer had a 64% increased odds of experiencing catastrophic financial burden compared with patients without a history of cancer (odds ratio 1.64, 95% confidence interval, 1.17-2.31). Furthermore, patients with a gastrointestinal cancer had nearly 40% increased odds of high financial burden associated with their care compared with patients without cancer (odds ratio 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.88).  Conclusion:   The risk of experiencing catastrophic financial burden among patients with gastrointestinal cancer was considerable, as roughly 1 in 7 patients experienced high financial burden, and 1 in 13 had a catastrophic financial burden.""","""['Daniel R Rice', 'Ayesha Farooq', 'J Madison Hyer', 'Anghela Z Paredes', 'Junu Bae', 'Diamantis I Tsilimigras', 'Timothy M Pawlik']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Surgery""","""['Financial toxicity risk among adult patients undergoing cancer surgery in the United States: An analysis of the National Inpatient Sample.', 'Association of Out-of-Pocket Annual Health Expenditures With Financial Hardship in Low-Income Adults With Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in the United States.', 'Out-of-Pocket Annual Health Expenditures and Financial Toxicity From Healthcare Costs in Patients With Heart Failure in the United States.', 'Economic Burden of Chronic Ill Health and Injuries for Households in Low- and Middle-Income Countries.', ""Simple truths about America's uninsured."", 'Diagnosis by Volatile Organic Compounds in Exhaled Breath in Exhaled Breath from Patients with Gastric and Colorectal Cancers.', 'End-of-Life Hospice Use and Medicare Expenditures Among\xa0Patients Dying of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'ASO Author Reflections: Optimizing End-of-Life Care for Patients Dying from Hepatocellular Carcinoma.']"""

However, general fatigue is frequently observed in patients after introduction of enzalutamide. Here, we used the Cancer Fatigue Scale (CFS) to monitor general fatigue after introduction of enzalutamide, and administered the Japanese herbal medicine (Kampo) drug, Hochuekkito, for management of general fatigue. (Materials and methods) Three patients with CRPC were enrolled in this retrospective observational study. The patients were all male, 72, 69, and 88 years old, respectively, and had received previous hormone therapy for CRPC. They complained of general fatigue 2-5 weeks after introduction of enzalutamide. The CFS was divided into three subcategories: physical fatigue, affective fatigue, and cognitive fatigue. Hochuekkito was prescribed for management of general fatigue. Moreover, 31 previous CRPC cases treated in our hospital were divided into a general fatigue group and a non-general fatigue group. The period of enzalutamide prescription was compared among the previous groups and the present three cases to determine the usefulness of Hochuekkito. (Results) In this series, CFS was useful to monitor general fatigue after introduction of enzalutamide. General fatigue after introduction of enzalutamide mainly consisted of physical fatigue, and improved in two of the three cases included in this study. However, enzalutamide was discontinued in one patient due to general fatigue. Fourteen of our 31 previous CRPC cases developed general fatigue after introduction of enzalutamide. The mean periods of enzalutamide prescription were 265.6, 173.2, and 193.0 days in the non-general fatigue, general fatigue, and the present three cases, respectively. The differences among the groups were not significant. (Conclusions) The CFS is useful to monitor general fatigue, including its subcategories, after introduction of enzalutamide in patients with CRPC. The Kampo medicine Hochuekkito may be useful for management of general fatigue in such cases.""","""['Tomonori Minagawa', 'Takahisa Domen', 'Toshiro Suzuki', 'Manabu Ueno', 'Takashi Nagai', 'Teruyuki Ogawa', 'Hideo Kiyokawa', 'Osamu Ishizuka']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Nihon Hinyokika Gakkai Zasshi""","""['IMPACT OF GENERAL FATIGUE ON TREATMENT PERIOD AFTER INDUCTION OF ENZALUTAMIDE FOR CASTRATION-RESISTANT PROSTATE CANCER.', 'Survival Outcomes, Prostate-specific Antigen Response, and Tolerance in First and Later Lines of Enzalutamide Treatment for Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: A Real-World Experience in Hong Kong.', 'Enzalutamide versus flutamide for castration-resistant prostate cancer after combined androgen blockade therapy with bicalutamide: study protocol for a multicenter randomized phase II trial (the OCUU-CRPC study).', 'Enzalutamide for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Enzalutamide (Xtandi) for patients with metastatic, resistant prostate cancer.', 'The Qigong of Prolong Life With Nine Turn Method Relieve Fatigue, Sleep, Anxiety and Depression in Patients With Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: A Randomized Controlled Clinical Study.']"""

Silymarin is a plant flavonoid obtained from milk thistle; the main active principles in milk thistle are silybin (silibinin), sylichrisitin and silydianin, commonly referred as silymarin. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the radiation modulatory effects of silymarin on cancer cells. For this, we used the HCT-15 and RKO colon cancer cell lines as a model. Pre-irradiation treatment of cells with silymarin (20 mg/ml) followed by radiation exposure inhibits colon cancer cell proliferation and enhances cell death in a time-dependent manner. We have also examined the changes in p53 phosphorylation at Ser15, phosphorylation of p38 and their association with DNA damage. Silymarin was found to reduce proliferation of the human colon carcinoma cells in a concentration and time-dependent manner. Moreover, percentage of cell death was also increased in combined treatment (20µg/ml of silymarin + radiation). Our studies indicate that the combination increases the arrest of cells in G2/M phase of cell cycle, DNA damage-induced decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and a decrease of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, which are associated with an increase in cell death. Altogether, these results suggest that silymarin sensitizes colon cancer cells to radiation, strategy with potential for colon cancer treatment. Noteworthy, since silymarin was previously shown to confer protection against radiation in at least some types of normal tissues, additional studies are needed to further investigate the potential of silymarin in colon cancer therapy when combined with radiation, its potential protective effects on normal tissues and its mechanisms of action.""","""['Mitu Lal', 'Damodar Gupta']""","""[]""","""2016""","""None""","""Discoveries (Craiova)""","""['Silymarin and silibinin cause G1 and G2-M cell cycle arrest via distinct circuitries in human prostate cancer PC3 cells: a comparison of flavanone silibinin with flavanolignan mixture silymarin.', 'Silibinin upregulates the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human colon carcinoma HT-29 cells.', 'Curcumin Sensitizes Silymarin to Exert Synergistic Anticancer Activity in Colon Cancer Cells.', 'Anticancer potential of silymarin: from bench to bed side.', 'Prostate cancer prevention by silibinin.', 'Role of Silymarin in Cancer Treatment: Facts, Hypotheses, and Questions.']"""

However, accurate registration remains a challenging task due to the lack of ground truth regarding voxel-level spatial correspondence, limited field of view, low contrast-to-noise ratio, and signal-to-noise ratio in TRUS. In this study, we proposed a fully automated deep learning approach based on a weakly supervised method to address these issues. We employed deep learning techniques to combine image segmentation and registration, including affine and nonrigid registration, to perform an automated deformable MRI-TRUS registration. To start with, we trained two separate fully convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to perform a pixel-wise prediction for MRI and TRUS prostate segmentation. Then, to provide the initialization of the registration, a 2D CNN was used to register MRI-TRUS prostate images using an affine registration. After that, a 3D UNET-like network was applied for nonrigid registration. For both the affine and nonrigid registration, pairs of MRI-TRUS labels were concatenated and fed into the neural networks for training. Due to the unavailability of ground-truth voxel-level correspondences and the lack of accurate intensity-based image similarity measures, we propose to use prostate label-derived volume overlaps and surface agreements as an optimization objective function for weakly supervised network training. Specifically, we proposed a hybrid loss function that integrated a Dice loss, a surface-based loss, and a bending energy regularization loss for the nonrigid registration. The Dice and surface-based losses were used to encourage the alignment of the prostate label between the MRI and the TRUS. The bending energy regularization loss was used to achieve a smooth deformation field. Thirty-six sets of patient data were used to test our registration method. The image registration results showed that the deformed MR image aligned well with the TRUS image, as judged by corresponding cysts and calcifications in the prostate. The quantitative results showed that our method produced a mean target registration error (TRE) of 2.53 ± 1.39 mm and a mean Dice loss of 0.91 ± 0.02. The mean surface distance (MSD) and Hausdorff distance (HD) between the registered MR prostate shape and TRUS prostate shape were 0.88 and 4.41 mm, respectively. This work presents a deep learning-based, weakly supervised network for accurate MRI-TRUS image registration. Our proposed method has achieved promising registration performance in terms of Dice loss, TRE, MSD, and HD.""","""['Qiulan Zeng', 'Yabo Fu', 'Zhen Tian', 'Yang Lei', 'Yupei Zhang', 'Tonghe Wang', 'Hui Mao', 'Tian Liu', 'Walter J Curran', 'Ashesh B Jani', 'Pretesh Patel', 'Xiaofeng Yang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Automatic prostate segmentation using deep learning on clinically diverse 3D transrectal ultrasound images.', 'MR to ultrasound image registration with segmentation-based learning for HDR prostate brachytherapy.', 'Ultrasound prostate segmentation based on multidirectional deeply supervised V-Net.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'How to Improve TRUS-Guided Target Biopsy following Prostate MRI.', 'A review of artificial intelligence in prostate cancer detection on imaging.', 'Artificial Intelligence in Radiation Therapy.', 'Machine Learning in Prostate MRI for Prostate Cancer: Current Status and Future Opportunities.', 'Catheter position prediction using deep-learning-based multi-atlas registration for high-dose rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'A review of deep learning based methods for medical image multi-organ segmentation.']"""

The amount of data processed by cancer registries increases every year, making manual registration more and more tedious.  Objective:   We sought to develop an automatic analysis pipeline that would be able to identify and preprocess registry input for incident prostate adenocarcinomas in a French regional cancer registry.  Methods:   Notifications from different sources submitted to the Bas-Rhin cancer registry were used here: pathology data and, ICD 10 diagnosis codes from hospital discharge data and healthcare insurance data. We trained a Support Vector Machine model (machine learning) to predict whether patient's data must be considered or not as a prostate adenocarcinoma incident case that should therefore be registered. The final registration of all identified cases was manually confirmed by a specialized technician. Text mining tools (regular expressions) were used to extract clinical and biological data from non-structured pathology reports.  Results:   We performed two successive analyses. First, we used 982 cases manually labeled by registrars from the 2014 dataset to predict the registration of 785 cases submitted in 2015. Then, we repeated the procedure using the 2089 cases labeled by registrars from the 2014 and 2015 datasets to predict the registration of 926 cases submitted in the 2016 data. The algorithm identified 663 cases of prostate adenocarcinoma in 2015, and 610 in 2016. From these findings, 663 and 531 cases were respectively added to the registry; and 641 and 512 cases were confirmed by the specialized technician. This registration process has achieved a precision level above 96 %. The algorithm obtained an overall precision of 99 % (99.5 % in 2015 and 98.5 % in 2016) and a recall of 97 % (97.8 % in 2015 and 96.9 % in 2016).

We used a tumor tissue array of differing stages and grades to define the relationships between these components and identified a strong positive correlation between p14ARF and AR expression.

Compliance rates with biopsies vary but the subsequent impact on oncologic outcomes is not known. The objective of this study was to determine whether noncompliance with the confirmatory biopsy negatively impacts prostate cancer specific outcomes.  Materials and methods:   A retrospective analysis was performed on a prospective single-arm cohort of men enrolled in active surveillance for prostate cancer between 1995 and 2018 with a median followup of 9.1 years. A total of 1,275 patients were enrolled and 1,043 had a minimum of 3 years of followup and were included in the analysis. Patients were stratified by compliance with a confirmatory biopsy within 24 months of enrollment in active surveillance. The primary outcome was recurrence-free survival. Secondary outcomes included metastatic-free survival and cause specific survival.  Results:   A total of 1,275 patients were enrolled, and 1,043 had a minimum of 3 years of followup and were included in the analysis, of whom 425 were treated for localized prostate cancer. Patients noncompliant with the confirmatory biopsy had higher rates of recurrence after treatment (19% vs 12%, HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.19-2.26, p=0.003) and metastases (7% vs 2%, HR 3.56, 95% CI 1.8-7.0, p=0.0003) even after accounting for age, prostate specific antigen and Grade Group. Cause specific survival was not significantly different between the 2 groups. The results were consistent even in the subset of patients with Grade Group 1 disease at study entry.

At last, the regulatory effects of METTL3/LEF1 axis on the activity of the Wnt pathway and migratory ability in PC-3 cells were determined.  Results:   METTL3 and LEF1 were upregulated in PCa tissues, and they presented a positive correlation in PCa. A high level of METTL3 predicted poor prognosis in PCa patients. The knockdown of METTL3 suppressed the migratory ability in PC-3 cells. Meanwhile, the knockdown of METTL3 downregulated protein level of LEF1 and decreased the activity of the Wnt pathway. The results of RIP assay indicated that METTL3 methylation sites were present on LEF1 mRNA. Moreover, the silence of METTL3 decreased the enrichment abundance of LEF1 in anti-IGF2BP2. Rescue experiments demonstrated that the overexpression of LEF1 partially reversed the regulatory effects of METTL3 on the Wnt activity and migratory ability in PCa cells.  Conclusions:   METTL3 is upregulated in PCa tissues. METTL3 influences the activity of the Wnt pathway through m6A methylation on LEF1 mRNA, thereafter, promoting the progression of PCa.""","""['X-X Ma', 'Z-G Cao', 'S-L Zhao']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci""","""['The m6A methyltransferase METTL3 promotes osteosarcoma progression by regulating the m6A level of LEF1.', 'Progression of Thyroid Carcinoma Is Promoted by the m6A Methyltransferase METTL3 Through Regulating m6A Methylation on TCF1.', 'The m6A methyltransferase METTL3 promotes the stemness and malignant progression of breast cancer by mediating m6A modification on SOX2.', 'The role of RNA methyltransferase METTL3 in gynecologic cancers: Results and mechanisms.', 'Novel insights into the m6A-RNA methyltransferase METTL3 in cancer.', 'The emerging roles and mechanism of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications in urologic tumours progression.', 'CSNK1D-mediated phosphorylation of HNRNPA2B1 induces miR-25-3p/miR-93-5p maturation to promote prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration through m6A-dependent manner.', 'Roles of RNA Methylations in Cancer Progression, Autophagy, and Anticancer Drug Resistance.', 'RNA modification writers pattern in relation to tumor microenvironment and prognosis in prostate cancer.', 'Clinical and molecular significance of the RNA m6A methyltransferase complex in prostate cancer.']"""

This study was designed to explore the functions of long intergenic noncoding RNA 00844 (LINC00844) in PC progression. The expression of LINC00844 and glutathione S-transferase P1-1 (GSTP1) was detected by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, followed by the identification of the relationship among LINC00844, GSTP1, and early B cell factor 1 (EBF1) by dual luciferase reporter gene assay, RNA immunoprecipitation assay, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Using loss- and gain-of-function assays, the effects of LINC00844, GSTP1, and EBF1 on the biological characteristics of PC cells were assessed by cell counting kit-8 assay, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assay, and flow cytometry. Lastly, the results from in vitro experiments were verified in vivo by establishing a xenograft tumor model in nude mice. LINC00844 and GSTP1 both displayed low expression in PC tissues and cells. LINC00844 positively regulated the expression of GSTP1 via recruiting EBF1. Overexpression of LINC00844 reduced proliferation and elevated apoptosis of PC cells through recruiting EBF1, which subsequently upregulated GSTP1. In vivo experiments confirmed that LINC00844 or GSTP1 upregulation attenuated tumor growth. LINC00844 elevated GSTP1 expression by recruiting EBF1 to the promoter region of GSTP1, thereby suppressing PC progression.

Addressing these uncertainties will provide more insight into PCRA and inform further research on the value of PCRA prevention. The goals of this study were to measure associations between PCRA and HRQOL at domain and subdomain levels, and to evaluate the association between PCRA and probable (ie, predicted major) depression.  Method:   We analyzed secondary cross-sectional data from the North Carolina Prostate Cancer Comparative Effectiveness & Survivorship Study (NC ProCESS-a population-based cohort of prostate cancer patients enrolled shortly after diagnosis [between January 2011 and June 2013] and followed prospectively).

Using prostate cancer surgery as an example, this national study analysis aims to simulate the effect of different centralization scenarios on the number of center closures, patient travel times, and equity in access.  Methods:   We used patient-level data on all men (n = 19,256) undergoing radical prostatectomy in the English National Health Service between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2014, and considered three scenarios for centralization of prostate cancer surgery services A: procedure volume, B: availability of specialized services, and C: optimization of capacity. The probability of patients travelling to each of the remaining centers in the choice set was predicted using a conditional logit model, based on preferences revealed through actual hospital selections. Multivariable linear regression analysed the impact on travel time according to patient characteristics.  Results:   Scenarios A, B, and C resulted in the closure of 28, 24, and 37 of the 65 radical prostatectomy centers, respectively, affecting 3993 (21%), 5763 (30%), and 7896 (41%) of the men in the study. Despite similar numbers of center closures the expected average increase on travel time was very different for scenario B (+15 minutes) and A (+28 minutes). A distance minimization approach, assigning patients to their next nearest center, with patient preferences not considered, estimated a lower impact on travel burden in all scenarios. The additional travel burden on older, sicker, less affluent patients was evident, but where significant, the absolute difference was very small.  Conclusion:   The study provides an innovative simulation approach using national patient-level datasets, patient preferences based on actual hospital selections, and personal characteristics to inform health service planning. With this approach, we demonstrated for prostate cancer surgery that three different centralization scenarios would lead to similar number of center closures but to different increases in patient travel time, whilst all having a minimal impact on equity.""","""['Ajay Aggarwal', 'Stéphanie A van der Geest', 'Daniel Lewis', 'Jan van der Meulen', 'Marco Varkevisser']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Impact of centralization of prostate cancer services on the choice of radical treatment.', 'Health service planning to assess the expected impact of centralising specialist cancer services on travel times, equity, and outcomes: a national population-based modelling study.', 'Impact of travel distance to the treatment facility on overall mortality in US patients with prostate cancer.', 'No difference in six-year biochemical failure rates with or without pelvic lymph node dissection during radical prostatectomy in low-risk patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Considering the role of radical prostatectomy in 21st century prostate cancer care.', 'Impact of centralization of prostate cancer services on the choice of radical treatment.', 'Influence of travel burden on tumor classification and survival of head and neck cancer patients.']"""

Materials and methods:   We queried a prospectively maintained database for patients who underwent NS RARP between 2009 and 2018 in a low-intermediate volume PCa center. Risk-groups were defined according to the D'Amico classification. Pentafecta outcomes referred to the postsurgical presence of potency and continence, and the absence of biochemical recurrence (BCR), positive surgical margins (PSM), and perioperative complications. The Kruskall-Wallis test, the t test and the Mann-Whitney tests were used when appropriate.  Results:   603 patients underwent NS RARP and 484 patients were evaluated for Pentafecta outcomes. Median postsurgical follow-up was 28 months. Overall, 137 (22.7%), 376 (62.3%), and 90 (15%) patients were diagnosed in the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively. Patients undergoing NS RARP shifted from 33 to 20% in the low-risk group, from 52 to 62% in the intermediate-risk group, and from 10 to 13% in the high-risk group. Patients reaching Pentafecta increased from 38 to 44%. No postoperative potency was the main reason for non-achieving Pentafecta (71%). BCR strongly limited Pentafecta achievement in the high-risk group (61%), but not in intermediate (24%) and low-risk (30%) groups.  Conclusions:   Low-intermediate volume PCa centers show similar trends to high-volume centers regarding risk group distributions over time in PCa patients undergoing NS RARP.

Materials and methods:   One hundred ninety patients (68 ± 9 years) were retrospectively evaluated at 3T MRI for clinical suspicion of PCa. Included were 201 peripheral zone (PZ) PCa lesions. Histopathological confirmation on fusion biopsy was matched with normal prostate parenchyma contralaterally. Biopsy results were grouped into benign tissue and low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups (Gleason sum score 6, 7, and > 7, respectively). DCE MRI was performed using golden-angle radial sparse MRI. Perfusion maps (Ktrans, Kep, Ve), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and absolute T2w signal intensity were determined and used as input features for building two ML models: GBM with/without perfusion maps. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values for correlated models were compared.  Results:   For the classification of benign vs. malignant and intermediate- vs. high-grade PCa, perfusion information added relevant information (AUC values 1 vs. 0.953 and 0.909 vs. 0.700, p < 0.001 and p = 0.038), while no statistically significant effect was found for low- vs. intermediate- and high-grade PCa.  Conclusion:   Perfusion information from DCE MRI acquisition schemes with high spatiotemporal resolution to ML classifiers enables a superior risk stratification between benign and malignant and intermediate- and high-risk PCa in the PZ compared with classifiers based on T2w/DWI information alone.  Key points:   • In the recent guidelines, the role of DCE MRI has changed from a mandatory to recommended sequence. • DCE MRI acquisition schemes with high spatiotemporal resolution (e.g., GRASP) have been shown to improve the diagnostic performance compared with conventional DCE MRI sequences. • Using perfusion information acquired with GRASP in combination with ML classifiers significantly improved the prediction of benign vs. malignant and intermediate- vs. high-grade peripheral zone prostate cancer compared with non-contrast sequences.""","""['David J Winkel', 'Hanns-Christian Breit', 'Tobias K Block', 'Daniel T Boll', 'Tobias J Heye']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Compressed Sensing Radial Sampling MRI of Prostate Perfusion: Utility for Detection of Prostate Cancer.', 'A direct comparison of contrast-enhanced ultrasound and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging for prostate cancer detection and prediction of aggressiveness.', 'Revisiting DCE-MRI: Classification of Prostate Tissue Using Descriptive Signal Enhancement Features Derived From DCE-MRI Acquisition With High Spatiotemporal Resolution.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'The emerging role of diffusion-weighted MRI in prostate cancer management.', 'More than Meets the Eye: Using Textural Analysis and Artificial Intelligence as Decision Support Tools in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis-A Systematic Review.']"""

A novel tumor suppressor CKLF-like MARVEL transmembrane domain-containing member 5(CMTM5) has a MARVEL domain and may regulate transmembrane signaling. Thus, we postulated that CMTM5 could regulate EGFR and its downstream molecules to affect the biological behaviors of PCa cells. In this study, we found that CMTM5 was expressed in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissues but was undetectable in PCa cells. However, the EGFR was upregulated in PCa cells, especially in two metastatic CRPC cell lines, PC3 and DU145. Furthermore, ectopic expression of CMTM5-v1 suppressed cell proliferation and migration and p-EGFR levels. Further investigation revealed that restoration of CMTM5-v1 inhibited not only EGF-mediated proliferation but also chemotactic migration by EGF in PC3 and DU145 cells. Moreover, mechanistic studies showed that CMTM5-v1 attenuated EGF-induced receptor signaling by repressing EGFR and Akt phosphorylation in PCa cells, which were essential for malignant features. Finally, CMTM5-v1can promote the sensitivity of PC3 cells to Gefetinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeting the EGFR. These observations indicate that CMTM5-v1 suppressed PCa cells through EGFR signaling. The loss of CMTM5 may participate in the progression of PCa resulting from deregulated EGFR, and CMTM5 might be associated with the efficacy of TKIs in terms of their potent inhibition of EGFR and human epidermal growth factor-2 (HER2) activation.""","""['Yeqing Yuan', 'Zhengzuo Sheng', 'Zhenhua Liu', 'Xiaowei Zhang', 'Yunbei Xiao', 'Jing Xie', 'Yixiang Zhang', 'Tao Xu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Cancer""","""['CMTM5 is reduced in prostate cancer and inhibits cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo.', 'CMTM5 inhibits the development of prostate cancer via the EGFR/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.', 'Expression and significance of CMTM5 and epidermal growth factor receptor in prostate cancer.', 'Research advances in CKLF-like MARVEL transmembrane domain containing member 5.', 'An update of the mechanisms of resistance to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors in breast cancer: Gefitinib (Iressa) -induced changes in the expression and nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking of HER-ligands (Review).', 'DOPE/CHEMS-Based EGFR-Targeted Immunoliposomes for Docetaxel Delivery: Formulation Development, Physicochemical Characterization and Biological Evaluation on Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'CMTM Family and Gastrointestinal Tract Cancers: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Progressive axonopathy when oligodendrocytes lack the myelin protein CMTM5.', 'Interplay of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 in Prostate Cancer: Beyond Androgen Receptor Transactivation.', 'Expression and clinical significance of CMTM1 in hepatocellular carcinoma.']"""

At this stage, current therapies scantily improve survival of the patient. Androgens and estrogens are involved in normal prostate and prostate cancer development. The mechanisms by which estrogens/estrogen receptors (ERs) induce prostate cancer and promote prostate cancer progression have not yet been fully identified. Our laboratory has shown that androgen-independent prostate cancer cells PC-3 express both ERα and ERβ. The activation of ERβ increases the expression of β-catenin and proliferation of PC-3 cells. We now report that the activation of ERβ promotes the increase of migration, invasion and anchorage-independent growth of PC-3 cells. Furthermore, the activation of ERα also plays a role in invasion and anchorage-independent growth of PC-3 cells. These effects are blocked by pretreatment with PKF 118-310, compound that disrupts the complex β-catenin/TCF/LEF, suggesting that ERs/β-catenin are involved in all cellular characteristics of tumor development in vitro. Furthermore, PKF 118-310 also inhibited the upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) induced by activation of ERs. VEGF also is involved on invasion of PC-3 cells. In conclusion, this study provides novel insights into the signatures and molecular mechanisms of ERβ in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells PC-3.

However, it is uncertain if poorer outcomes are due to disparities in access to medical care rather than true biological differences.  Methods:   Observational cohort study of patients diagnosed with low-risk PC-Gleason score ≤6, clinical tumor stage ≤2A, and prostate specific antigen (PSA) level ≤10-at US Department of Veterans Affairs between January 1, 2001 and October 31, 2015 and treated with radical prostatectomy. Outcomes included upgrading to Gleason Grade Group 2 (GG2), GG ≥ 3, PSA recurrence, pathologic tumor stage ≥3, positive surgical margins, and all-cause mortality.  Results:   A total of 2857 men (AA: 835 White: 2022) with a median follow-up of 7.1 years. Overall, there was no significant difference between AA and White men in upgrading to GG ≥ 3 (RR = 1.18, p = 0.43), tumor stage ≥3 (RR = 0.95, p = 0.74), positive surgical margins (RR = 1.14, p = 0.20), PSA recurrence (SHR = 1.26, p = 0.06), and all-cause mortality (SHR = 1.26, p = 0.16). However, there was a significant increase in upgrading for AA to GG2 (RR = 1.49, p < 0.01).  Conclusions:   There was no significant difference in most adverse pathologic outcomes between AA and White patients. However, GG2 upgrading was more common in AA men. The implication is that AA may need to undergo additional evaluation, such as a biopsy MRI, before initiating AS. Whether the increase in GG2 upgrading will lead to poorer long-term clinical outcomes such as metastasis and PCSM also requires further investigation.""","""['Rishi Deka', 'J Kellogg Parsons', 'Daniel R Simpson', 'Paul Riviere', 'Vinit Nalawade', 'Lucas K Vitzthum', 'A Karim Kader', 'Christopher J Kane', 'Chelsea S Rock', 'James D Murphy', 'Brent S Rose']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided Confirmatory Biopsy for Initiating Active Surveillance of Prostate Cancer.', 'Association of Prostate-Specific Antigen Velocity With Clinical Progression Among African American and Non-Hispanic White Men Treated for Low-Risk Prostate Cancer With Active Surveillance.', 'African American Race is Not Associated with Risk of Reclassification during Active Surveillance: Results from the Canary Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance Study.', 'Is active surveillance a suitable option for African American men with prostate cancer?

Over a third of prostate cancer (PCa) patients treated with radical prostatectomy and postoperative radiotherapy experience disease recurrence; these patients are considered incurable by current standards. Often the recurrence cannot be localised by conventional imaging (CT and bone scan). Combined anatomical imaging with CT and/or MR with positron emission tomography (PET) using a novel second-generation prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) probe, [18F]DCFPyL, is a promising imaging modality to unveil disease deposits in these patients. A new and earlier molecularly defined oligorecurrent (OR) state may be amenable to focal-targeted ablative curative-intent therapies, such as stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) or surgery, thereby significantly delaying or completely avoiding the need for palliative therapies in men with recurrent PCa after maximal local treatments.  Methods and analysis:   This ongoing single-institution phase II study will enrol up to 75 patients total, to include up to 37 patients with response-evaluable disease, who have rising prostate-specific antigen (range 0.4-3.0 ng/mL) following maximal local therapies with no evidence of disease on conventional imaging. These patients will undergo [18F]DCFPyL PET-MR/CT imaging to detect disease deposits, which will then be treated with SABR or surgery. The primary endpoints are performance of [18F]DCFPyL PET-MR/CT, and treatment response rates following SABR or surgery. Demographics and disease characteristics will be summarised and analysed descriptively. Response rates will be described with waterfall plots and proportions.

This open-label phase 2 clinical study evaluated the tolerability and efficacy of seviteronel in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) previously treated with enzalutamide.  Patients and methods:   Patients with mCRPC whose disease previously progressed while receiving enzalutamide therapy were divided into 2 cohorts on the basis of prior exposure to docetaxel. Seviteronel was administered without routine oral steroids either twice daily with dose titration (450 mg) or once daily without dose titration (600 or 750 mg). The primary objective was to determine the rate of significant prostate-specific antigen response (ie, decline of ≥ 50%) after 12 weeks of seviteronel therapy.  Results:   Seventeen patients, with a median (range) age of 71 (60-92) years, were enrolled, with 8 patients having received prior docetaxel. Patients received a median of 2 cycles of treatment, with most patients discontinuing treatment because of toxicity related to the study drug. The most common adverse events included concentration impairment, fatigue, tremor, and nausea. Despite changes in dosing, the study was closed prematurely because of the high magnitude of toxicity. One (6%) of 17 patients experienced a significant decline in prostate-specific antigen.  Conclusion:   Seviteronel was not generally well tolerated nor associated with significant clinical responses in patients with mCRPC who had previously received enzalutamide.

Averages of plans with and without the NTO were obtained from the dose-volume histogram, and behaviours, comparisons, and quality were assessed considering homogeneity, conformity, and radiation plan indexes.  Results:   We were not able to find significant differences in the conformity index, homogeneity index, and radiation planning index between groups with and without the NTO or between treatment times. We observed a small advantage in NTO plans regarding hot spots in the central region of the planning target volume.  Conclusion:   The NTO is an important tool used in the optimization of plans; however, possibly due to the anatomical location of the prostate, we failed to find a significant contribution of its use in the treatment of prostate cancer.

A superextended pelvic lymph node dissection (sePLND) can be considered in selected very-high-risk PCa patients.  Objective:   To demonstrate a reproducible robot-assisted technique for sePLND at the time of RP for PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   From June 2016 to August 2019, 41 consecutive patients with localized PCa and very high risk for lymph node invasion (LNI) received a robot-assisted RP and a standardized 10-step monoblock ePLND, followed by a 5-step monoblock sePLND. Very high risk for LNI was defined as ≥30% risk for LNI, as calculated by the Briganti 2017 nomogram.  Surgical procedure:   After performing the ePLND template resection (harvesting lymph nodes from the obturator region, external and internal iliac vessels, and common iliac vessels up to the ureter crossing), the 5-step monoblock sePLND approach was performed. The sePLND template was tailored to the common iliac vessels up to the aortic and caval bifurcation as well as the presacral region.  Measurements:   Lymph node yield, perioperative complications.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 41 patients received sePLND, reporting a median (interquartile range [IQR]) number of nodes removed of 23 (19-29). Median operative time (including RP, ePLND, and sePLND) was 256 min. Median preoperative prostate-specific antigen was 12 ng/mL (IQR 6.45-17.6). Disease stage pT <3 was found in 10 (24.4%) patients, pT3a in nine (22%) patients, pT3b in 21 (51.2%) patients, and pT4 in one (2.4%) patient. Of the treated patients, 54% revealed LNI: five (4.9%) in a solitary node, five (4.9%) in two to five nodes, and 12 (29.3%) in more than five nodes. Considering perioperative complications, three (7.3%) patients experienced Clavien I-II and four (9.7%) experienced Clavien ≥ III complications. Median hospital stay was 6 d. No patient underwent postoperative blood transfusion.  Conclusions:   The 5-step sePLND approach is a reproducible and feasible technique for PCa patients at a very high risk of LNI.

However, the incidence of Prostate cancer (ICD-10 code C61) (PCa), or cancers in general, are poorly documented in Eritrea. This study analyses the data available to produce an estimate of the incidence of PCa in Eritrea.  Methods:   We conducted a retrospective study by identifying all incident cases of PCa captured between 2011-2018 in the National Health Laboratory pathology database (Polytech 8.37.C); Urology departments of Orotta Referral Hospital and Sembel Hospital. Crude incidence rates (CIRs), age-adjusted rates per 100,000 person years and associated trends were subsequently calculated. Joinpoint Regression Program, V.4.5.0.1 was employed in these analyses.  Results:   A total of 1721 cases were reported, of which 1593 (92.5%) were benign prostatic hypertrophy cases and 128 (7.5%) were PCa cases. The mean (±SD) age of the patients with PCa was 73.49 (± 8.9), confidence interval (CI) (54-98) and the minimum and maximum ages were 54 and 98, respectively. The median age interquartile ranges (IQR) was 73 (13) years. The highest and lowest PCa incidence rates were in 2017 (4.51 per 100 000) and 2014 (2.69 per 100 000), respectively. The age standardised rates (ASIR) (World) over the study period (2011-2018) was 30.26 per 100 000. The annualized ASIR values over the study period was 3.78 per 100 000. The associated average annual percentage change (APC) (CI) over the study period was 5.4 (-1.4-12.7), P-value = 0.100, showing a static trend over the study period.  Conclusion:   This study suggests that previous reports have under-estimated the incidence of PCa in Eritrea. The study provides ample evidence on the need for research targeted at uncovering the true burden of PCa in Eritrea. Potential solutions will require the establishment of high-quality population-based cancer registries (PBCRs) and long-term commitment to improvements in research, training, screening, diagnosis, and the overall management of PCa in the country.""","""['Lidia Biniam Medhin', 'Oliver Okoth Achila', 'Biniam Efrem Syum', 'Kibrom Hailu Gebremichael', 'Salih Mohammed Said', 'Hartmut Lobeck', 'Yosief Tewolde Ghidei']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Incidence of Cervical, Ovarian and Uterine Cancer in Eritrea: Data from the National Health Laboratory, 2011-2017.', 'Italian cancer figures, report 2012: Cancer in children and adolescents.', 'Incidence of colorectal cancer in Eritrea: Data from the National Health Laboratory, 2011-2017.', 'An Estimate of the Incidence of Prostate Cancer in Africa: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Prostate Cancer Registries: Current Status and Future Directions.', 'Mapping Evidence on the Burden of Breast, Cervical, and Prostate Cancers in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Scoping Review.']"""

Mechanisms by which this is accomplished include AR amplification and expression of AR splice variants, demonstrating that AR remains a key therapeutic target in advanced disease. For the first time we show that IKBKE drives AR signalling in advanced PC. Significant inhibition of AR regulated gene expression was observed upon siRNA-mediated IKBKE depletion or pharmacological inhibition due to inhibited AR gene expression in multiple cell line models including a LNCaP derivative cell line resistant to the anti-androgen, enzalutamide (LNCaP-EnzR). Phenotypically, this resulted in significant inhibition of proliferation, migration and colony forming ability suggesting that targeting IKBKE could circumvent resistance to AR targeting therapies. Indeed, pharmacological inhibition in the CWR22Rv1 xenograft mouse model reduced tumour size and enhanced survival. Critically, this was validated in patient-derived explants where enzymatic inactivation of IKBKE reduced cell proliferation and AR expression. Mechanistically, we provide evidence that IKBKE regulates AR levels via Hippo pathway inhibition to reduce c-MYC levels at cis-regulatory elements within the AR gene. Thus, IKBKE is a therapeutic target in advanced PC suggesting repurposing of clinically tested IKBKE inhibitors could be beneficial to castrate resistant PC patients.""","""['Alex Bainbridge', 'Scott Walker', 'Joseph Smith', 'Kathryn Patterson', 'Aparna Dutt', 'Yi Min Ng', 'Huw D Thomas', 'Laura Wilson', 'Benjamin McCullough', 'Dominic Jones', 'Arussa Maan', 'Peter Banks', 'Stuart R McCracken', 'Luke Gaughan', 'Craig N Robson', 'Kelly Coffey']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Nucleic Acids Res""","""['PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is dominant over androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer cells.', 'Changes in androgen receptor nongenotropic signaling correlate with transition of LNCaP cells to androgen independence.', 'Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 functions as an epigenetic activator of the androgen receptor to promote prostate cancer cell growth.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer.', 'CDC20 Is Regulated by the Histone Methyltransferase, KMT5A, in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'AR activates YAP/TAZ differentially in prostate cancer.', 'Pharmacological Efficacy of Repurposing Drugs in the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Emerging Role of YAP and the Hippo Pathway in Prostate Cancer.', 'RNA sequencing and integrative analysis reveal pathways and hub genes associated with TGFβ1 stimulation on prostatic stromal cells.']"""

Patients and methods Study was conducted on a retrospective cohort of 123 PCa patients with initial total PSA ≤ 10 ng/ml, number of needle biopsy specimens ≥ 8, GS 6 on biopsy and T1/T2 estimated clinical stage who underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and whose archived formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) prostate needle biopsy specimens were used for additional immunohistochemistry staining for detection of NF-κB p65. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear NF-κB p65 expression in biopsy cores with PCa were correlated with postoperative pathological stage, positive surgical margins, GS and biochemical progression of disease. Results After follow-up of 66 months, biochemical progression (PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/ml) occurred in 6 (5.1%) patients, 3 (50%) with GS 6 and 3 (50%) with GS 7 after radical prostatectomy. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear NF-κB p65 expressions were not significantly associated with pathological stage, positive surgical margin and postoperative GS. Patients with positive cytoplasmic NF-kB reaction had significantly more frequent biochemical progression than those with negative cytoplasmic NF-kB reaction with PSA 0.2 ng/ml as cutoff point (p = 0.015) and a trend towards more biochemical progression with PSA ≥ 0.05 ng/ml as cutoff point (p = 0.068).

Immunohistochemical staining and immunoblotting were performed to determine the protein levels. Rates of proliferation, invasion and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells were assessed using an RTCA system and flow cytometric assays. Levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were assessed using Cell ROX Orange reagent and mRNA levels of Nrf2 target genes were detected by qRT‑PCR. It was revealed that p62 increased the levels and activities of Nrf2 by suppressing Keap1‑mediated proteasomal degradation in prostate cancer cells and tissues, and high levels of p62 promoted growth of prostate cancer through the Keap1/Nrf2/ARE system. Silencing of Nrf2 in DU145 cells overexpressing p62 led to decreases in the rate of cell proliferation and invasion and an increase in the rate of cell apoptosis. p62 activated the Nrf2 pathway, promoted the transcription of Nrf2‑mediated target genes and suppressed ROS in prostate cancer.

Understanding the underlying mechanism of RT resistance in CRPC may potentially highlight novel targets to improve therapeutic options for patients with PCa. In the present study, the expression levels of phospholipase Cε (PLCε), androgen receptor (AR) and DNA‑dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (PKcs) were examined in PCa tissue samples and PCa cells, and the effects of PLCε knockdown on AR and DNA damage repair (DDR)‑related molecules were determined. The association between PLCε, AR and Poly (ADP‑ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), as well as their respective roles in radiation resistance, were assessed using gene knockdown and pharmaceutical inhibitors or activators. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was used to determine the epigenetic regulatory effects of PLCε on PARP1. Animal experiments were performed to assess whether the mechanisms observed in vitro could be replicated in vivo. The expression levels of PLCε, AR and DNA‑PKcs were significantly upregulated in PCa, particularly in CRPC. PLCε knockdown reduced the viability and increased apoptosis of cells subjected to radiation. Additionally, PLCε deficiency suppressed DDR progression by downregulating an AR and PARP1 positive feedback loop and the associated downstream molecules following radiation. PLCε depletion also increased the presence of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation in the PARP1 promoter region, suggesting increased methylation of the PARP1 gene and thus resulting in reduced expression of PARP1. In vivo, PLCε knockdown significantly potentiated the effects of radiation on tumor growth.

Materials and methods:   We propose to utilize both CBCT and CBCT-based synthetic MRI (sMRI) for the segmentation of soft tissue and bony structures, as they provide complementary information for pelvic organ segmentation. CBCT images have superior bony structure contrast and sMRIs have superior soft tissue contrast. Prior to segmentation, sMRI was generated using a cycle-consistent adversarial networks (CycleGAN), which was trained using paired CBCT-MR images. To combine the advantages of both CBCT and sMRI, we developed a cross-modality attention pyramid network with late feature fusion. Our method processes CBCT and sMRI inputs separately to extract CBCT-specific and sMRI-specific features prior to combining them in a late-fusion network for final segmentation. The network was trained and tested using 100 patients' datasets, with each dataset including the CBCT and manual physician contours. For comparison, we trained another two networks with different network inputs and architectures. The segmentation results were compared to manual contours for evaluations.  Results:   For the proposed method, dice similarity coefficients and mean surface distances between the segmentation results and the ground truth were 0.96 ± 0.03, 0.65 ± 0.67 mm; 0.91 ± 0.08, 0.93 ± 0.96 mm; 0.93 ± 0.04, 0.72 ± 0.61 mm; 0.95 ± 0.05, 1.05 ± 1.40 mm; and 0.95 ± 0.05, 1.08 ± 1.48 mm for bladder, prostate, rectum, left and right femoral heads, respectively. As compared to the other two competing methods, our method has shown superior performance in terms of the segmentation accuracy.

We filtered the SEER 2009-2011 records and divided them into four groups regarding patient races and cancer grades. On such a partition, we performed a series of statistical analyses to further clarify the aforementioned disparity. Molecular evidence for a primary result of the epidemiological analysis was obtained from gene expression data. The results include: (1) Based on the registry-specific measures, a significant linear regression of total mortality rate (as well as PCa specific mortality rate) on the percentage of (Gleason pattern-based) high-grade cancers (PHG) is demonstrated in EAs (p < 0.01) but not in AAs; (2) PHG and its racial disparity are differentiated across ages and the groups defined by patient outcomes; (3) For patients with cancers in the same grade category, i.e. the high or low grade, the survival stratification between races is not significant in most geographical areas; and (4) The genes differentially expressed between AAs' and EAs' tumors of the same grade category are relatively rare. The perception that prostate tumors are more lethal in AAs than in EAs is reasonable regarding AAs' higher PHG, while high grade alone could not imply aggressiveness. However, this perception is questionable when the comparison is focused on cases within the same grade category. Supporting observations for this conclusion hold a remarkable implication for erasing racial disparity in PCa. That is, ""Equal grade, equal outcomes"" is not only a verifiable hypothesis but also an achievable public health goal.""","""['Wensheng Zhang', 'Yan Dong', 'Oliver Sartor', 'Erik K Flemington', 'Kun Zhang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Integrative comparison of the genomic and transcriptomic landscape between prostate cancer patients of predominantly African or European genetic ancestry.', 'Racial differences in the incidence of breast cancer subtypes defined by combined histologic grade and hormone receptor status.', 'Geographic Distribution of Racial Differences in Prostate Cancer Mortality.', 'Racial disparity in prostate cancer in the African American population with actionable ideas and novel immunotherapies.', 'Racial disparities: disruptive genes in prostate carcinogenesis.', 'Identification of novel biomarkers differentially expressed between African-American and Caucasian-American prostate cancer patients.', 'Deciphering the Increased Prevalence of TP53 Mutations in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Asian Ethnic Subgroup Disparities in Delays of Surgical Treatment for Breast Cancer.', 'In Situ Analysis of N-Linked Glycans as Potential Biomarkers of Clinical Course in Human Prostate Cancer.', 'Comprehensive Analysis of Multiple Cohort Datasets Deciphers the Utility of Germline Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.']"""

Osteolytic secondaries are an uncommon entity. In such scenarios, it is important to differentiate prostatic metastases from other pathologies which give an identical radiological appearance, such as multiple myeloma. Another important point to remember is that neurological complications secondary to prostatic metastases are quite uncommon.  Case presentation:   We describe a man with advanced prostatic carcinoma who presented to us with an uncommon combination of sudden onset complete paraplegia associated with diminished sensation in the lower half of the body and diffuse osteolytic lesions in the entire skeletal system. On detailed workup, it was found that his prostatic specific antigen (PSA) was grossly elevated. Markers for multiple myeloma were negative. Accordingly, computerized tomography of the abdomen was performed. The latter revealed an enlarged prostate gland infiltrating into the bladder base. Histopathological analysis from the prostate as well as the bone marrow showed an identical picture thereby confirming our diagnosis. The individual underwent palliative spinal canal decompression following which he was put on anti-androgenic treatment. At one year follow up, he was ambulatory and able to walk with use of crutches.  Discussion:   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of osteolytic prostatic metastases presenting as complete paraplegia. In this situation, in addition to evaluation for prostate CA, we also recommend screening for multiple myeloma as the clinico-radiological profile of the two diseases are similar but their management is very different.""","""['Akshat Gupta', 'Nitesh Gahlot', 'Poonam Elhence']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Spinal Cord Ser Cases""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'A case of prostate cancer associated with osteolytic bone metastases.', 'Comparison of bone scintigraphy and 18F-FDG PET-CT in a prostate cancer patient with osteolytic bone metastases.', 'Bone and skeletal muscle metastases from gastric adenocarcinoma: unusual radiographic, CT and scintigraphic features.', 'The new bisphosphonate, Zometa (zoledronic acid), decreases skeletal complications in both osteolytic and osteoblastic lesions: a comparison to pamidronate.', 'MR imaging features to predict the type of bone metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'Prostate adenocarcinoma with osteolytic metastases: Case report and review of the literature.']"""

Individual tumor samples have been found to contain multiple fusions, and it remains unknown whether these fusions increase tumor immunogenicity. Here, we investigated the role of fusion burden on the prevalence and expression of key molecular and immune effectors in prostate cancer tissue specimens that represented the different stages of disease progression and androgen sensitivity, including hormone-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer. We found that tumor fusion burden was inversely correlated with tumor mutational burden and not associated with disease stage. High fusion burden correlated with high immune infiltration, PD-L1 expression on immune cells, and immune signatures, representing activation of T cells and M1 macrophages. High fusion burden inversely correlated with immune-suppressive signatures. Our findings suggest that high tumor fusion burden may be a more appropriate biomarker than tumor mutational burden in prostate cancer, as it more closely associates with immunogenicity, and suggests that tumors with high fusion burden could be potential candidates for immunotherapeutic agents.""","""['Marie-Claire Wagle', 'Joseph Castillo', 'Shrividhya Srinivasan', 'Thomas Holcomb', 'Kobe C Yuen', 'Edward E Kadel', 'Sanjeev Mariathasan', 'Daniel L Halligan', 'Adrian R Carr', 'Max Bylesjo', 'Paul R McAdam', 'Sarah Lynagh', 'Koen M Marien', 'Mark Kockx', 'Yannick Waumans', 'Shih-Min A Huang', 'Mark R Lackner', 'Zineb Mounir']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Immunol Res""","""['Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Status and Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes in Hot Spots of Primary and Liver Metastases in Prostate Cancer With Neuroendocrine Differentiation.', 'Immune infiltrates and PD-L1 expression in treatment-naïve acinar prostatic adenocarcinoma: an exploratory analysis.', 'Cytolytic activity correlates with the mutational burden and deregulated expression of immune checkpoints in colorectal cancer.', 'Targeted literature review on use of tumor mutational burden status and programmed cell death ligand 1 expression to predict outcomes of checkpoint inhibitor treatment.', 'TMPRSS2:ERG Gene Fusions in Prostate Cancer of West African Men and a Meta-Analysis of Racial Differences.', 'The characteristics and clinical relevance of tumor fusion burden in non-EBV (+) gastric cancer with MSS.', 'The characteristics and clinical relevance of tumor fusion burden in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Immunotherapy in Advanced Prostate Cancer-Light at the End of the Tunnel?', 'What Do We Have to Know about PD-L1 Expression in Prostate Cancer?

We performed a phase 2 trial to assess the ability of GTx-758, an oral selective estrogen receptor alpha agonist, to result in a ≥ 50% PSA decline by day 90, modulate free testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels, and affect estrogen deficiency adverse events.  Patients and methods:   CRPC patients received GTx-758 in two dose cohorts, 125 and 250 mg/d. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who experienced a ≥ 50% PSA decline by day 90. Secondary endpoints included changes in testosterone, SHBG, bone turnover markers, and hot flashes, as well as safety.  Results:   Four (10.5%) of 38 (95% CI, 2.9, 24.8; P = .120) and 10 (25.6%) of 39 patients (95% CI, 13.0, 42.1; P < .001) in the GTx-758 125 and 250 mg/d cohorts, respectively, experienced ≥ 50% PSA decline. SHBG was increased, providing a mechanism for notable decreases in free testosterone. In the 250 mg/d cohort, 9 men presented with moderate to severe hot flashes, and after 12 weeks, 4 (44%) of 9 reported either mild or no hot flashes (P = .001). The rate of venous thromboembolic events was 0% and 5.1% in the 125 and 250 mg/d arms, respectively.  Conclusion:   GTx-758 has clinical activity for CRPC in a dose-dependent fashion.

We estimated mortality counts and rates for 2020 in the European Union (EU) and for its six most populous countries.  Materials and methods:   We obtained cancer death certification and population data from the World Health Organization and Eurostat databases for 1970-2015. We estimated projections to 2020 for 10 major cancer sites plus all neoplasms and calculated the number of avoided deaths over 1989-2020.  Results:   Total cancer mortality rates in the EU are predicted to decline reaching 130.1/100 000 men (-5.4% since 2015) and 82.2 in women (-4.1%) in 2020. The predicted number of deaths will increase by 4.7% reaching 1 428 800 in 2020. In women, the upward lung cancer trend is predicted to continue with a rate in 2020 of 15.1/100 000 (higher than that for breast cancer, 13.5) while in men we predicted further falls. Pancreatic cancer rates are also increasing in women (+1.2%) but decreasing in men (-1.9%). In the EU, the prostate cancer predicted rate is 10.0/100 000, declining by 7.1% since 2015; decreases for this neoplasm are ∼8% at age 45-64, 14% at 65-74 and 75-84, and 6% at 85 and over. Poland is the only country with an increasing prostate cancer trend (+18%). Mortality rates for other cancers are predicted to decline further. Over 1989-2020, we estimated over 5 million avoided total cancer deaths and over 400 000 for prostate cancer.  Conclusion:   Cancer mortality predictions for 2020 in the EU are favourable with a greater decline in men. The number of deaths continue to rise due to population ageing. Due to the persistent amount of predicted lung (and other tobacco-related) cancer deaths, tobacco control remains a public health priority, especially for women.

Methods:   A longitudinal prospective study design was undertaken among cancer patients using data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey. The longitudinal effect was captured using a fixed effect multinomial logistic regression model, which predicted changes in the relationship between cancer burden and work disability level controlling for socio-demographic, lifestyle and life conditions predictors.  Results:   The prevalence of long-term disability among cancer survivors was 50%, with 18% of patients experiencing extreme work disability. The magnitude of disability levels increased significantly with the level of health burden. Cancer survivors who faced a severe health burden were at 5.32 times significantly higher risk of having work disability compared with patients who had no health burden. Other potential predictors, such as older patients (relative risk ratio, RRR = 1.82; 95% CI: 1.57, 5.87), those engaged in lower levels of physical activities (RRR = 1.91; 95% CI: 1.07, 3.40), those who drink alcohol (RRR = 1.29; 95% CI: 1.15, 1.49), and poor socioeconomic status (RRR = 1.28; 95% CI: 1.16, 2.23) were all significantly associated with extreme work disability.  Conclusion:   A substantial proportion of cancer survivors experienced work disability which was more pronounced with the magnitude of the cancer health burden. The different dimensions of disability might be prevented by introducing cancer survivor-specific evidence-based interventions, and incorporating comprehensive social support.

In this study, we compared the protein profiles of two prostate cancer cell lines with different metastatic potentials, and identified cofilin-1 (CFL1) was one of the most differentially expressed proteins between two cell lines. Further results suggested that cofilin-1 promoted the remodeling of F-actin cytoskeleton, and enhanced the proliferation, migration and invasion of the prostate cancer cells via activation of P38 MAPK signaling pathway. In addition, cofilin-1 elevated the expression and drug efflux activity of multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) by P38 MAPK signaling pathway, resulting in decrease of the adriamycin-induced apoptosis as well as the lytic cell death, and the subsequent resistance against adriamycin. Collectively, cofilin-1 might serve as a novel target candidate for both inhibiting the metastasis and reversing the chemoresistance of PCa.""","""['Liankuai Chen', 'Jialong Cai', 'Yishan Huang', 'Xiangpeng Tan', 'Qiuxiao Guo', 'Xiaomian Lin', 'Cairong Zhu', 'Xiangfeng Zeng', 'Hongjiao Liu', 'Xiaoping Wu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur J Pharmacol""","""['Doxorubicin-resistant variants of human prostate cancer cell lines DU 145, PC-3, PPC-1, and TSU-PR1: characterization of biochemical determinants of antineoplastic drug sensitivity.', 'Doxorubicin induces prostate cancer drug resistance by upregulation of ABCG4 through GSH depletion and CREB activation: Relevance of statins in chemosensitization.', 'Doxorubicin-induced F-actin reorganization in cofilin-1 (nonmuscle) down-regulated CHO AA8 cells.', 'Cofilin-1 and Other ADF/Cofilin Superfamily Members in Human Malignant Cells.', 'Insights into Chemoresistance of Prostate Cancer.', 'CRISPR screens identify gene targets at breast cancer risk loci.', 'Suppressing of Src-Hic-5-JNK-AKT Signaling Reduced GAPDH Expression for Preventing the Progression of HuCCT1 Cholangiocarcinoma.', 'Targeting autophagy in prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic response.', 'BAIAP2L1 enables cancer cell migration and facilitates phospho-Cofilin asymmetry localization in the border cells.']"""

Patients and methods:   A total of 103 patients with locally advanced progressive and symptomatic CSPC or CRPC underwent PES (radical cystoprostatectomy, n = 71 [68.9%]; radical prostatectomy with continent vesicostomy, n = 9 [8.7%]; total exenteration, n = 23 [22.3%]). All patients underwent local staging via magnetic resonance imaging, cystoscopy and rectoscopy. Systemic staging was carried out with chest, abdominal and pelvic computed tomography scans and bone scans. Peri-operative complications were assessed according to Clavien-Dindo classification. Symptom-free and overall survival were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical tests were two-tailed with a P value <0.05 taken to indicate statistical significance.  Results:   After a median (range) follow-up of 36.5 (3-123) months, the symptom-free survival rate at 1 and 3 years was 89.2% (n = 89) and 64.1% (n = 66), respectively.

Patients and methods:   Patients underwent combined systematic mapping and targeted transperineal prostate biopsies at a single institution. Biopsies were performed using the Precisionpoint device (Perineologic, Cumberland, MD, USA) under either local anaesthetic (58%, 163/282), i.v. sedation (12%, 34/282) or general anaesthetic (30%, 85/282). A mean (range) of 24 (5-42) systematic and 4.2 (1-11) target cores were obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were reported using the Likert scale. Clinically significant cancer was defined as Gleason 7 or above. Histopathological results were correlated with the presence of an MRI abnormality within a spatial quadrant and the other adjoining or non-adjoining (opposite) quadrants. Histological concordance with radical prostatectomy specimens was analysed.  Results:   A total of 282 patients were included in this study. Their mean (range) age was 66.8 (36-80) years, median (range) prostate-specific antigen level 7.4 (0.91-116) ng/mL and mean prostate volume 45.8 (13-150) mL. In this cohort, 82% of cases (230/282) were primary biopsies and 18% (52/282) were patients on surveillance. In all, 69% of biopsies (195/282) were identified to have clinically significant disease (Gleason ≥3 + 4). Any cancer (Gleason ≥3 + 3) was found in 84% (237/282) of patients. Of patients with clinically significant disease, the target biopsies alone picked up 88% (171/195), with systematic biopsy picking up the additional 12% (24/195) that the target biopsies missed. This altered with Likert score; 73% of Likert score 3 disease was detected by target biopsy, 92% of Likert score 4 and 100% of Likert score 5. Target biopsies with additional same-quadrant-only systematic cores picked up 75% (18/24) of significant cancer that was missed on target only, found in the same quadrant as the target.  Conclusion:   Systematic biopsy is still an important tool when evaluating all patients referred for prostate biopsy, but the need is decreased with increasing suspicion on MRI. Patients with very high suspicion of prostate cancer (Likert score 5) may not require systematic cores, unless representative surrounding biopsies are required for other specific treatments (e.g. focal therapy, or operative planning).

Methods:   To distinguish these two possibilities, this study examined the effect of prebiopsy MRI on the rate of pathologic upgrading and downgrading at prostatectomy in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked data from 2010 to 2015. Logistic regression was performed to assess the effect of MRI use on the Gleason grade change between biopsy and prostatectomy.  Results:   Among biopsy-naive men, those who underwent prebiopsy MRI had higher odds of downgrading at prostatectomy (odds ratio [OR], 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.66). In contrast, the odds of upgrading were significantly lower for men who underwent prebiopsy MRI (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.61-0.99). Limitations included a low overall rate of MRI-utilization prior to biopsy and an inability to distinguish between template, software-assisted and cognitive fusion biopsy.

Dynein cytoplasmic 1 light intermediate chain 1 (DYNC1LI1) has been previously associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and prostate cancer. Cytoskeletal structures are involved in the regulation of the mucosal barrier integrity. Thus, improving our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate the mucosal barrier is critical for cancer management and treatment. The present study aimed to investigate DYNC1LI1 expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues. The American Joint Committee on Cancer Stage II CRC cell line LS 174T was used to determine the association between the cellular expression levels of DYNC1LI1 and different types of mucin (MUC) by reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR. The role of DYNC1LI1 in cell chemosensitivity and proliferation was also evaluated in the presence of the DNA analog 5‑fluorouracil (5‑FU) or the platinum‑based drug, oxaliplatin by the MTT assay. LS 174T cells with decreased expression levels of DYNC1LI1 were discovered to be more sensitive to 5‑FU compared with LS 174T cells with endogenous DYNC1LI1 expression levels. Moreover, LS 174T cells transfected with short hairpin RNA targeting DYNC1LI1 were associated with low MUC1 and high MUC2, MUC4 and MUC5AC expression levels. Notably, the CRC cells with low MUC1 expression levels and high expression levels of the other MUCs (MUC2, MU4 and MUC5AC) were shown to benefit from 5‑FU treatment. In conclusion, the findings of the present study have suggested that DYNC1LI1 expression may be significantly associated with MUC expression levels and may be used to predict the chemotherapeutic efficiency. However, additional functional studies and clinical reports are required for an improved understanding of the significance of these molecular interactions in tumorigenesis.""","""['Chun-Chao Chang#', 'Kuo-Ching Chao#', 'Chi-Jung Huang', 'Chih-Sheng Hung', 'Yen-Chieh Wang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['Reactivating p53 and Inducing Tumor Apoptosis (RITA) Enhances the Response of RITA-Sensitive Colorectal Cancer Cells to Chemotherapeutic Agents 5-Fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin.', 'Knockout of DLIC1 leads to retinal cone degeneration via disturbing Rab8 transport in zebrafish.', 'HIPK2 is a potential predictive marker of a favorable response for adjuvant chemotherapy in stage II colorectal cancer.', 'Immunohistochemical study of MUC1, MUC2 and MUC5AC in colorectal carcinoma and review of literature.', 'Significance of mucin expression in pancreatobiliary neoplasms.', 'Potential prognostic and predictive value of UBE2N, IMPDH1, DYNC1LI1 and HRASLS2 in colorectal cancer stool specimens.', 'Bitter- and Umami-Related Genes are Differentially Associated with Food Group Intakes: the Framingham Heart Study.', 'A pilot radiogenomic study of DIPG reveals distinct subgroups with unique clinical trajectories and therapeutic targets.', 'Exploration and validation of a novel prognostic signature based on comprehensive bioinformatics analysis in hepatocellular carcinoma.']"""

The data showed that TMP treatment reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis in a dose‑dependent manner. Reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR showed TMP treatment increased the expression of lncRNA DPP10‑AS1 in PCa cells. Furthermore, DPP10‑AS1 was also upregulated in TMP‑resistant PCa cells. Knockdown of DPP10‑AS1 reversed TMP resistance, whereas increased expression of DPP10‑AS1 abrogated the TMP‑mediated cytotoxicity in PCa cells. In addition, forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) was verified as the functional target of DPP10‑AS1, and knockdown of FOXM1 reversed the TMP/DPP10‑AS1‑induced cell cytotoxicity.

Tumor necrosis factor‑related apoptosis‑inducing ligand (TRAIL), a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family, initiates the apoptosis of certain cancer cells. Neferine, a primary ingredient of bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids, has various antitumor activities. The present study examined the effects of neferine treatment on human PCa cells. Human prostate cancer (DU145) cells were treated with neferine for 18 h, and subsequently treated with TRAIL for 2 h. Combined treatment with neferine and TRAIL significantly decreased cell viability compared to treatment with TRAIL alone. Furthermore, neferine treatment decreased the expression of p62 and increased LC3B‑II expression, as assessed by western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry. It was alsp demonstrated that neferine and TRAIL act synergistically to trigger autophagy in PCa cells, as revealed by autophagosome formation, LC3B‑II accumulation demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis and phosphorylated c‑Jun N‑terminal kinase (p‑JNK) upregulation. When the autophagic flux was attenuated by the inhibitor, chloroquine, or by genetically modified ATG5 siRNA, the enhancement of TRAIL‑induced autophagy by neferine‑induced was also attenuated. Furthermore, treatment with the JNK inhibitor, SP600125, distinctly increased the viability of the cells treated with neferine and TRAIL. On the whole, the findings of the present study demonstrate that neferine treatment effectively promotes TRAIL‑mediated cell death and this effect likely occurs via the autophagic flux and the JNK pathway.""","""['Uddin Md Nazim#', 'Honghua Yin#', 'Sang-Youel Park']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Luteolin sensitizes human liver cancer cells to TRAIL‑induced apoptosis via autophagy and JNK‑mediated death receptor 5 upregulation.', 'Sensitizing TRAIL‑resistant A549 lung cancer cells and enhancing TRAIL‑induced apoptosis with the antidepressant amitriptyline.', 'Neferine promotes the apoptosis of HNSCC\xa0through the accumulation of p62/SQSTM1 caused by autophagic flux inhibition.', 'Autophagic flux determines cell death and survival in response to Apo2L/TRAIL (dulanermin).', 'Downregulation of c‑FLIP and upregulation of DR‑5 by cantharidin sensitizes TRAIL‑mediated apoptosis in prostate cancer cells via autophagy flux.', 'Mechanisms of Prostate Cancer Cells Survival and Their Therapeutic Targeting.', 'DUSP4 inhibits autophagic cell death and apoptosis in colorectal cancer by regulating BCL2-Beclin1/Bax signaling.', 'Emerging Hallmarks of Metabolic Reprogramming in Prostate Cancer.', 'Neferine, a novel ROCK1-targeting inhibitor, blocks EMT process and induces apoptosis in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Neferine Exerts Ferroptosis-Inducing Effect and Antitumor Effect on Thyroid Cancer through Nrf2/HO-1/NQO1 Inhibition.']"""

This is known as field cancerization, or a field effect and denotes a state of pre‑malignancy. Such alterations in histologically normal tumor‑adjacent prostatic tissues have been recognized as clinically important and are potentially exploitable as biomarkers of disease and/or targets for preventative/therapeutic intervention. The authors have previously identified and validated two protein markers of field cancerization: The expressional upregulation of the transcription factor early growth response 1 (EGR‑1) and the lipogenic enzyme fatty acid synthase (FASN). However, the molecular etiology of prostate field cancerization, including EGR‑1 and FASN upregulation, remains largely unknown. It was thus hypothesized that extracellular vesicles, notably exosomes, released by tumor lesions may induce molecular alterations in the surrounding tissues, resulting in field cancerization, priming the tissue, and ultimately promoting multifocal tumorigenesis, which is often observed in prostate cancer. Towards testing this hypothesis, the current study, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time, presents correlative protein expression data, generated in disease‑free, tumor‑adjacent and cancerous human prostate tissues by quantitative immunofluorescence, between the exosomal marker CD9, and EGR‑1 and FASN. Despite the pilot character of the present study, and the static nature and heterogeneity of human tissues, the data suggest that CD9 expression itself is part of a field effect.

However, there is little research on the expression profile, clinical value and detailed functions of PRNCR1 in tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC). The aim of the present study was to determine PRNCR1 expression in TSCC and to examine the involvement of PRNCR1 in TSCC progression. The molecular mechanisms behind the oncogenic effects of PRNCR1 in TSCC cells were also investigated. PRNCR1 was revealed to be upregulated in TSCC tumors and cell lines. The high PRNCR1 expression showed a significant correlation with tumor size, clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, and shorter overall survival times among patients with TSCC. A PRNCR1‑knockdown reduced TSCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and increased apoptosis in vitro. Additionally, the PRNCR1‑knockdown slowed down in vivo tumor growth of TSCC cells. With regards to the mechanism, PRNCR1 acted as a competing endogenous RNA on microRNA‑944 (miR‑944) in TSCC cells, and the effects of the PRNCR1‑knockdown were reversed by an miR‑944‑knockdown. HOXB5 was validated as a direct target gene of miR‑944 in TSCC cells, and HOXB5 expression was found to be positively regulated by PRNCR1. Furthermore, resumption of HOXB5 expression reversed the tumor‑suppressive actions of miR‑944 in TSCC cells. In conclusion, PRNCR1 acts as an oncogenic lncRNA in TSCC through the upregulation of HOXB5 by sponging miR‑944, thereby indicating a potential therapeutic target in TSCC.""","""['Cong Lin', 'Yanan Zou', 'Ruijing Li', 'Daofeng Liu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Mol Med""","""['Retracted Long non‑coding RNA PRNCR1 exerts oncogenic effects in tongue squamous cell carcinoma in\xa0vitro and in\xa0vivo by sponging microRNA‑944 and thereby increasing HOXB5 expression.', 'SNHG17 enhances the malignant characteristics of tongue squamous cell carcinoma by acting as a competing endogenous RNA on microRNA-876 and thereby increasing specificity protein 1 expression.', 'Long non-coding RNA PRNCR1 modulates non-small cell lung cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, and EMT through PRNCR1/miR-126-5p/MTDH axis.', 'Upregulation of the long non-coding RNA AFAP1-AS1 affects the proliferation, invasion and survival of tongue squamous cell carcinoma via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.', 'Progress in the study of long noncoding RNA in tongue squamous cell carcinoma.', 'A review on the role of PRNCR1 in human disorders with an especial focus on cancer.', 'Novel Insights into miR-944 in Cancer.', 'PRNCR1: a long non-coding RNA with a pivotal oncogenic role in cancer.', 'lncRNA RPSAP52 induced the development of tongue squamous cell carcinomas via miR-423-5p/MYBL2.', '8q24.21 Locus: A Paradigm to Link Non-Coding RNAs, Genome Polymorphisms and Cancer.']"""

Cantharidin, a type of terpenoid, is extracted from the blister beetles (Mylabris genus) used in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Cantharidin elicits antibiotic, antiviral and antitumor effects, and can affect the immune response. The present study demonstrated that a cantharidin and TRAIL combination treatment regimen elicited a synergistic outcome in TRAIL‑resistant DU145 cells. Notably, it was also identified that cantharidin treatment initiated the downregulation of cellular FLICE‑like inhibitory protein (c‑FLIP) and upregulation of death receptor 5 (DR‑5), and sensitized cells to TRAIL‑mediated apoptosis by initiating autophagy flux. In addition, cantharidin treatment increased lipid‑modified microtubule‑associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B expression and significantly attenuated sequestosome 1 expression. Attenuation of autophagy flux by a specific inhibitor such as chloroquine and genetic modification using ATG5 small interfering RNA abrogated the cantharidin‑mediated TRAIL‑induced apoptosis. Overall, the results of the present study revealed that cantharidin effectively sensitized cells to TRAIL‑mediated apoptosis and its effects are likely to be mediated by autophagy, the downregulation of c‑FLIP and the upregulation of DR‑5.

How quality of life is affected by a nephrostomy and how many of these patients undergo further oncological treatment remains uncertain. The objective of this retrospective multicentre study was to look at the outcomes of patients who had percutaneous nephrostomy insertion for malignancy.  Methods:   We identified patients who had a nephrostomy inserted for ureteric obstruction due to malignancy at our institution from January 2015 to December 2018. We obtained data retrospectively from our electronic patient record system. Patients who had nephrostomy insertion for other causes such as ureteric calculi or injury were excluded from the study.  Results:   105 patients underwent nephrostomy insertion during this time interval. 51.42% patients (n = 54) had urological malignancies (bladder and/or prostate cancer). The median LOS was 14 days (range 1-104 days) post-procedure and 39.04% (n = 41) had at least one 30-day readmission to hospital. The average starting creatinine level was 348 mmol/L (range 49-1133) and the average creatinine at discharge was 170 mmol/L (range 44-651). Although the average change in the creatinine (190 mmol/L) is statistically significant (p < 0.001), it did not seem to prolong life of the patients. Only 26 (24.76%) patients were alive (all-cause mortality) at the end of the 4-year period with an average life expectancy of 139 days following nephrostomy. Only 30.47% (n = 32) patients underwent further oncological treatment.  Conclusion:   In our series, most patients who had nephrostomy insertion for ureteric obstruction due to malignancy had no further oncological treatment following insertion. Percutaneous nephrostomy is a procedure not without associated morbidity and does not always prolong survival. Due to the poor prognosis in cases of advanced malignancy, we advocate multi-disciplinary decision-making prior to nephrostomy insertion.""","""['Samuel Stephen Folkard', 'Srijit Banerjee', 'Richard Menzies-Wilson', 'Joseph Reason', 'Evangelos Psallidas', 'Elliot Clissold', 'Ahmad Al-Mushatat', 'Saurabh Chaudhri', 'James Stephen Arthur Green']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int Urol Nephrol""","""['Percutaneous nephrostomy for ureteric obstruction due to advanced pelvic malignancy: have we got the balance right?', 'Maintaining quality of life after palliative diversion for malignant ureteral obstruction.', 'The role of percutaneous nephrostomy in malignant ureteric obstruction.', 'Role of percutaneous nephrostomy in end of life prostate cancer patients: a systematic review of the literature.', 'Percutaneous urinary drainage and ureteric stenting in malignant disease.', 'Allium ureteral stent for the treatment of malignant ureteral obstruction: A median term study.', 'Acute kidney injury due to bilateral malignant ureteral obstruction: Is there an optimal mode of drainage?', 'Outcomes Related to Percutaneous Nephrostomies (PCN) in Malignancy-Associated Ureteric Obstruction: A Systematic Review of the Literature.', 'Acute Kidney Injury in the Patient with Cancer.']"""

The dichotomous role of BMPs as both tumor promoters and suppressors appears to be largely context based in both the cancer cell and the surrounding microenvironment. Myeloid cells including macrophages and neutrophils have been shown to be tumor promoting when stimulated from BMPs. We found that conditional deletion of BMPR1a in myeloid cells (LysMCre) restricts tumor progression in a syngeneic mouse prostate cancer model. Specific changes occurred in myeloid cells both in tumor bearing mice and tumor naïve mice throughout multiple tissues. We profiled myeloid subsets in the bone marrow, spleen and primary tumor and found myeloid BMPR1a loss altered the differentiation and lineage capability of distinct populations by histologic, flow cytometry and high dimensional mass cytometry analysis. We further confirmed the requirement for BMP signaling with pharmacologic inhibition of THP-1 and Raw264.7 activated into M2 macrophages with the BMP inhibitor DMH1.

Conclusion:   This study constitutes an early single institution series evaluating the use of 18F-fluciclovine PET scans in the assessment of biochemically recurrent prostate cancer after definitive treatment. The probability of having positive imaging findings and increasing numbers of suspicious lesions rises with increasing PSA. Utilization of a lower PSA threshold of 0.5 may allow earlier intervention with salvage therapies in biochemical recurrence. However, using a threshold below 1 carries a higher risk of negative scans. Employing a higher PSA threshold of 1 to 2 carries greater sensitivity and specificity and may maximize identifying individuals with early BCR who may benefit from early intervention, while minimizing negative scans.""","""['Joseph M Armstrong', 'Christopher R Martin', 'Christopher Dechet', 'Kathryn Morton', 'Daniel Evans', 'Jacob Ambrose', 'Benjamin L Maughan', ""Brock O'Neil"", 'William Lowrance']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Effect of hormonal therapy on 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT in the detection of prostate cancer recurrence, localization of metastatic disease, and correlation with prostate-specific antigen.', 'Prostate cancer recurrence in patients with negative or equivocal conventional imaging: A role for 18F-fluciclovine-PET/CT in delineating sites of recurrence and identifying patients with oligometastatic disease.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Fluorine-18-Labeled Fluciclovine PET/CT in Primary and Biochemical Recurrent Prostate Cancer Management.', 'A review discussing fluciclovine (18F) PET/CT imaging in the detection of recurrent prostate cancer.', '18Ffluciclovine vs. 18Ffluorocholine Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography: A Head-to-Head Comparison for Early Detection of Biochemical Recurrence in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Detection Rate and Clinical Impact of PET/CT with 18F-FACBC in Patients with Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer: A Retrospective Bicentric Study.', 'Clinical utility of 18F-Fluciclovine PET/CT in recurrent prostate cancer with very low (≤0.3 ng/mL) prostate-specific antigen levels.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-based imaging in localized and advanced prostate cancer: a narrative review.']"""

Objective:   To describe the landscape of CDK12 alterations across solid cancers and the clinical features of CDK12-altered prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   A single-center retrospective study of 26743 patients across 25 solid tumor types who underwent tumor sequencing was performed. Clinicopathologic features and outcomes were assessed in prostate cancer.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   CDK12 alterations and their association with genomic characteristics are described. For prostate cancer patients, overall survival and time to castration resistance were assessed using univariable and multivariable Cox regression analysis.  Results and limitations:   CDK12 alterations were identified in 404/26743 patients (1.5%) overall, but were most frequent in prostate (100/1875, 5.3%) and ovarian cancer (43/1034, 4.2%), in which they were associated with a high prevalence of truncating variants and biallelic inactivation. CDK12 alterations defined a genomic subtype of prostate cancer with a unique copy-number alteration profile and involvement of distinct oncogenic pathway alterations, including cell-cycle pathway genes. CDK12-altered prostate cancer was associated with somewhat more aggressive clinical features and shorter overall survival (median 64.4 vs 74.9 mo; p=0.032) independent of standard clinical factors and tumor copy-number alteration burden (adjusted hazard ratio 1.80, 95% confidence interval 1.12-2.89; p=0.024). The study is limited by its retrospective nature.  Conclusions:   CDK12 alteration is a rare event across solid cancers but defines a clinically distinct molecular subtype of prostate cancer associated with unique genomic alterations and slightly more aggressive clinical features.  Patient summary:   CDK12 gene alterations occur rarely across tumor types, but more frequently in prostate cancer, where they are associated with genomic instability, cell-cycle pathway gene alterations, and somewhat worse clinical outcomes, warranting further investigation of therapeutic targeting of this disease subset.""","""['Bastien Nguyen', 'Jose Mauricio Mota', 'Subhiksha Nandakumar', 'Konrad H Stopsack', 'Emily Weg', 'Dana Rathkopf', 'Michael J Morris', 'Howard I Scher', 'Philip W Kantoff', 'Anuradha Gopalan', 'Dmitriy Zamarin', 'David B Solit', 'Nikolaus Schultz', 'Wassim Abida']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['CDK12 Gene Alterations in Prostate Cancer: Present, but Clinically Actionable?', 'Clinical Outcomes in Cyclin-dependent Kinase 12 Mutant Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Pan-Cancer Analysis of CDK12 Loss-of-Function Alterations and Their Association with the Focal Tandem-Duplicator Phenotype.', 'Analysis of CDK12 alterations in a pan-cancer database.', 'Role and therapeutic potential of CDK12 in human cancers.', 'Human CDK12 and CDK13, multi-tasking CTD kinases for the new millenium.', 'Cell-free DNA in the management of prostate cancer: Current status and future prospective.', 'A generalizable machine learning framework for classifying DNA repair defects using ctDNA exomes.', 'Prognostic value of genomic mutations in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Preclinical models of prostate cancer - modelling androgen dependency and castration resistance in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo.', 'Sparse canonical correlation to identify breast cancer related genes regulated by copy number aberrations.']"""

Both reduced and increased CHK2 expression has been described in different tumour types with impact on patient prognosis. To evaluate prevalence and significance of altered CHK2 expression in prostate cancer, a tissue microarray containing 17,747 tumours was analysed by immunohistochemistry. Nuclear CHK2 immunostaining was absent or weak in benign prostate epithelium but often more prominent in cancers. CHK2 immunostaining was considered weak in 38.8%, moderate in 33.6% and strong in 11.2% of prostate cancers. High CHK2 expression was strongly associated with TMPRSS2:ERG fusions (p<0.0001). Subgroup analysis of ERG positive and negative cancers revealed that high CHK2 staining was significantly linked to advanced tumour stage, high Gleason score, positive nodal status, positive surgical margin, high preoperative PSA (p<0.0001 each) and early prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence (p=0.0001) in the subset of ERG negative cancers, while most of these associations were absent in ERG positive cancers. In ERG negative cancers, high CHK2 expression was an independent predictor of patient prognosis, even if parameters were included that were only available postoperatively. High CHK2 expression was also linked to presence of chromosomal deletions, high level of androgen receptor expression, positive p53 immunostaining, and high Ki-67 labelling index. These provide further in vivo evidence for previously described functional interactions. In summary, high CHK2 expression is linked to adverse tumour features and independently predicts early biochemical recurrence in ERG negative prostate cancer.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 171 patients who underwent an MRI-guided prostate needle biopsy at our institution. Patients whose prostate-specific antigen level was >4.0 ng/mL and who had suspicious prostate cancer (PCa) lesions by multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) underwent 2-core MRI-guided targeted biopsy (TB) and for MRI-guided TB: RVS and BioJet. RVS navigation synchronized mpMRI images with transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) images. BioJet navigation used a software program that merged images from mpMRI and TRUS to produce a composite image. We retrospectively compared the detection rate of PCa and the frequency of severe adverse events (AEs) between these two navigation systems, focusing on patients. In addition, we compared the detection rate of MRI-guided TB cores of two navigation systems regarding anatomical position (transitional zone [TZ] or peripheral zone [PZ]). Results: Data from RVS and BioJet biopsy groups were from 65 and 106 patients, respectively. Of these, RVS-TB included 141 cores (PZ: 49 cores, TZ: 92 cores), and BioJet-TB included 276 cores (PZ: 73 cores, TZ: 203 cores). In detecting PCa, by conducting both systematic biopsy and TB, and AEs in patients, a significant difference was not noted between RVS and BioJet navigation systems. In addition, there was no significant difference in the total detection rate for PCa in TB cores between the two methods. However, in the TZ, BioJet navigation showed a significantly higher detection rate of PCa than RVS navigation (35.0% vs 17.4%, p = 0.0023) by analyzing the cores of MRI-guided TB.

Gas plasmas act via the local deposition of a plethora of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that promote the oxidative cancer cell death. The immunological consequences of plasma-mediated tumor cell death are only poorly understood, however. To this end, we exposed two prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, PC3) to gas plasma in vitro, and investigated the immunomodulatory effects of the supernatants in as well as of direct co-culturing with two human myeloid cell lines (THP-1, HL-60). After identifying the cytotoxic action of the kINPen plasma jet, the supernatants of plasma-treated prostate cancer cells modulated myeloid cell-related mitochondrial ROS production and their metabolic activity, proliferation, surface marker expression, and cytokine release. Direct co-culture amplified differentiation-like surface marker expression in myeloid cells and promoted their antitumor-toxicity in the gas plasma over the untreated control conditions.

Patients and methods:   We studied a retrospective cohort study of 586 patients treated between the years 2000 and 2017 receiving radical prostatectomy with or without postoperative RT, external-beam RT (EBRT) with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), or EBRT plus brachytherapy (Brachy) boost + ADT. Patient-reported QOL for urinary, bowel, sexual, and overall physical and mental functioning was assessed using the American Urological Association symptom scale, the Sexual Health Inventory in Men, the Rectal-Function Assessment Scale, the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite, and the Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey.  Results:   Median follow-up for survival was 5 years. No significant differences between the treatments were observed for overall survival or metastasis-free survival at the P < .05 threshold. The propensity-adjusted 5-year metastasis-free survival estimates for EBRT + ADT, EBRT + Brachy + ADT, and surgery were 74.6%, 94.8%, and 83.1%, respectively. The EBRT + Brachy + ADT and surgery cohorts had significantly worse mean American Urological Association symptom scores at 6 months than the EBRT + ADT cohort, which resolved by 1 year. Surgical patients had better rectal function scores than EBRT + ADT patients at years 1 to 3, but similar function thereafter.

Exhibiting trypsin-like activity, KLK15 is most likely involved in the activation of prostate-specific antigen (PSA; also known as KLK3), an established biomarker for the diagnosis and screening of prostate cancer. High mRNA expression levels of KLK15 have already been reported in ovarian and prostate cancer, in contrast with breast cancer, where KLK15 has been proposed as a biomarker of favorable prognosis. In this study, we exploited the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology along with 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3' RACE) to discover alternative KLK15 splice variants. Extensive computational analysis of the obtained NGS data revealed the existence of novel splice junctions, thus supporting the existence of novel KLK15 transcripts. Six novel KLK15 splice variants were identified and verified by Sanger sequencing. Two of them (KLK15 v.11 and v.12) contain an open reading frame and are hence predicted to encode two novel KLK15 protein isoforms. Expression analysis of each KLK15 splice variant in sixteen cDNA pools from malignant cell lines and in normal cell lines (HEK293, HaCaT, and BJ cells) revealed very different expression profiles of particular KLK15 transcripts. Moreover, the new KLK15 splice variants were shown to be expressed in breast, ovarian, prostate, urinary bladder, colon, and renal tissue specimens. Due to the prominent clinical value of KLK15 mRNA expression, the novel KLK15 transcripts appear as candidate cancer biomarkers for diagnostic and/or prognostic purposes and, therefore, merit further investigation.""","""['Panagiotis G Adamopoulos', 'Fotini Ε Koukouzeli', 'Christos K Kontos', 'Andreas Scorilas']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Gene""","""['Identification and molecular cloning of novel transcripts of the human kallikrein-related peptidase 10 (KLK10) gene using next-generation sequencing.', 'Discovery of novel transcripts of the human tissue kallikrein (KLK1) and kallikrein-related peptidase 2 (KLK2) in human cancer cells, exploiting Next-Generation Sequencing technology.', 'Novel splice variants of the human kallikrein-related peptidases 11 (KLK11) and 12 (KLK12), unraveled by next-generation sequencing technology.', 'A survey of alternative transcripts of human tissue kallikrein genes.', 'Kallikrein-related peptidase (KLK) family mRNA variants and protein isoforms in hormone-related cancers: do they have a function?']"""

Patients and methods:   We studied a single-center sample of 6809 consecutive patients who underwent radical prostatectomy between 1992 and 2016 with a median age of 65 years and a median follow-up of 7.9 years. Multivariate competing risk analyses were performed with competing mortality as endpoint. Linear trends over the years of surgery for 5-year competing mortality rates and for mean ages were calculated using linear regression analyses. We estimated the number of live years gained over time using a heuristic model-based calculation: (hazard ratio year of surgery) 24 calendar years × (hazard ratio age at surgery) gained life years = 1.  Results:   After controlling for age, nonprostate cancer mortality decreased significantly during the observation period. Accumulated over the 24 years, this decrease of mortality corresponded to the effect of 6.3 years of calendric age. Most of the decrease in nonprostate cancer mortality (predominantly attributable to noncancer causes of death) was seen in patients aged 65 years or older (8.1 years gained), whereas there was only a marginal decrease in patients younger than 65 years (only 1 year gained). The decrease in nonprostate cancer mortality was accompanied by a slight increase of mean age at surgery (2.7 years) that did not nearly compensate the decreasing risk.

Understanding the complex effects of this receptor in different contexts requires further study. We reported that high ERβ expression is independently associated with improved prognosis in female colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Herein, we investigated the possible anti-tumour effect of ERβ and its selective agonist. CRC patients with high ERβ expression had significantly higher levels of membrane-associated β-catenin, cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2 (CysLT2 R), and 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH), which have anti-tumour effects, but lower levels of nuclear β-catenin, cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLT1 R), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which have tumour-promoting effects. These interesting findings were further supported by two different publicly available CRC mRNA datasets that showed a significant positive correlation between ERβ expression and 15-PGDH and CysLT2 R expression and a negative correlation between ERβ expression and β-catenin, CysLT1 R, and COX-2 expression. We next evaluated ERβ expression in three different colon cancer mouse models; ERβ expression was negatively correlated with tumourigenesis. Furthermore, treatment with the ERβ-agonist ERB-041 reduced CysLT1 R, active β-catenin, and COX-2 levels but increased phospho-β-catenin, CysLT2 R, and 15-PGDH levels in HCT-116, Caco-2, and SW-480 colon cancer cells compared to vehicle-treated cells. Interestingly, ERB-041-treated cells showed significantly decreased migration, survival, and colonosphere formation and increased apoptotic activity, as indicated by increased CASPASE-3 and apoptotic blebs. Finally, patients with low ERβ expression had significantly more distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis than patients with high ERβ expression. Therefore, we studied the effects of ERB-041-treated colon cancer cells in a zebrafish xenograft model. We found significantly less distant metastasis of ERB-041-treated cells compared to vehicle-treated cells. These results further support ERβ's anti-tumour role in CRC and the possible use of its agonist in CRC patients. © 2020 The Authors.

Randomized, level 1 evidence demonstrates that men who are managed with MRI and MRI-ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy (MRF-TB) have more clinically significant prostate cancer and less clinically insignificant prostate cancer detected and avoid biopsy altogether more often than men who undergo systematic, whole-gland prostate biopsy (SPB). Furthermore, strategies that incorporate MRF-TB have lower rates of upgrading on radical prostatectomy compared to SPB. However, generalizing this data to wider practice is challenging because there is a learning curve for interpreting MRI and performing MRF-TB, and some of the fusion technologies are better than others. We describe our group's early experience with the Fusion MR and Fusion Bx systems (Focal Healthcare, Toronto, ON, Canada). These products are designed with elastic fusion technology that is user-friendly, intuitive and accurate. The Fusion MR contouring system is straightforward and allows for contouring with several MRI sequences simultaneously. The Fusion Bx biopsy system has a semi-robotic arm that accounts for prostate deformation and patient movement and allows for freehand-like access, which is a seamless transition from SPB for clinicians. There were 68 lesions targeted in the first 51 patients. The overall cancer detection rate was 22%/61%/83% for PI-RADS 3/4/5, respectively. The Gleason grade group 2 prostate cancer or higher rate was 6%/47%/75% for PI-RADS 3/4/5, respectively. There were no major complications in this cohort of patients. Limitations of this study include small number of patients and lack of formal follow up to rule out sepsis. Overall, the Fusion MR and Fusion Bx systems are accurate, straightforward and safe to use for MRF-TB.

Our conceptual model involves the differential impact of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists and antagonists on the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) system.  Materials and methods:   Authors searched online repositories and meeting abstract databases for relevant materials.  Results:   Mounting evidence links FSH with development and progression of prostate cancer. What is also becoming clear is that the differential effects of GnRH agonists and antagonists on FSH may at least partially explain the differing effects these agents have on CV risk during ADT. While GnRH antagonists immediately suppress FSH, GnRH agonists provoke a transient surge in FSH that may contribute to the higher CV risk observed with these agents. Additionally, recent studies suggest that GnRH antagonists may significantly reduce CV risk compared to GnRH agonists, particularly in men with pre-existing CV disease.  Conclusions:   Patients with cardiovascular risk factors who require ADT may benefit from the better control of FSH provided by GnRH antagonists. ADT itself appears to heighten CV risk, and data suggest that FSH may at least partly drive this risk by promoting inflammation, atherosclerosis, insulin resistance, adipocyte rearrangement and plaque instability.""","""['E David Crawford', 'Andrew V Schally']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['Update on cardiovascular and metabolic risk profiles of hormonal agents used in managing advanced prostate cancer.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy and side effects: are GnRH antagonists safer?', 'Cardiovascular risk with androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Cardiovascular risk of androgen deprivation therapy for\xa0treatment of hormone-dependent prostate cancer : Differences\xa0between GnRH antagonists and GnRH agonists.', 'Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of degarelix for prostate cancer.', 'Testosterone suppression combined with high dose estrogen as potential treatment of SARS-CoV-2.

Kaplan-Meier curves and Uni/multivariate (MVA) analyses were used to examine the influence of CCI-group on overall (OS), disease-specific (DSS) and biochemical-relapse free (BRFS) survival.  Results:   We included 257 patients with median age 73 years (48-85), 53% African-American and 67% had intermediate-risk. Median prostate RT-dose was 76 Gy; and 47% received androgen-deprivation therapy. CCI-0,1,2+ groups encompassed 76 (30%), 54 (21%) and 127 (49%) patients, respectively and were well-balanced. Ten and 15-years OS were significantly different (76% versus 46% versus 55% for 10-years OS and 53% versus 31% versus 14% for 15-years OS for CCI-0 versus CCI-1[HR:2.25; CI[1.31-3.87]] versus CCI-2+[HR:2.73; CI[1.73-4.31]]; p < 0.001. CCI-0 had better DSS than CCI-2+ (HR:2.23; CI[1.06-4.68]; p = 0.03) and BRFS was similar (p = 0.99). Late G2/3 RT-toxicities were more common in CCI-2+ (47%) than CCI-1 (44%) and CCI-0 (29%), p = 0.032; with non-different acute-toxicities (p = 0.62). On MVA, increased CCI was deterministic for OS (HR:3.65; CI [1.71:7.79]; p < 0.001) and was only marginal for DSS (HR:2.55; CI [0.98-6.6]; p = 0.05) with no impact on BRFS (p > 0.05).  Conclusions:   Higher CCI is a significant predictor for late RT-related side-effects and shorter OS in men with localized prostate cancer. Baseline comorbidities should be considered during initial counseling and follow up visits.""","""['Ahmed I Ghanem', 'Remonda M Khalil', 'Gehan A Khedr', 'Amy Tang', 'Amr A Elsaid', 'Indrin J Chetty', 'Benjamin Movsas', 'Mohamed A Elshaikh']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['The need for androgen deprivation therapy in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with dose-escalated external beam radiation therapy.', 'Effect of Standard vs Dose-Escalated Radiation Therapy for Patients With Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer: The NRG Oncology RTOG 0126 Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'Exploring the Impact of Human Papillomavirus Status, Comorbidity, Polypharmacy, and Treatment Intensity on Outcome of Elderly Oropharyngeal Cancer Patients Treated With Radiation Therapy With or Without Chemotherapy.', 'Higher than standard radiation doses (> or =72 Gy) with or without androgen deprivation in the treatment of localized prostate cancer.', 'Influence of the technique and comorbidities in hypofractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Red Blood Cell Distribution Width Is Associated with All-cause Mortality but Not Adverse Cancer-specific Outcomes in Men with Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer Treated with Radical Prostatectomy: Findings Based on a Multicenter Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital Registry.', 'Assessment of a Clinical Trial-Derived Survival Model in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Hypogonadism and its treatment among prostate cancer survivors.']"""

Patients and methods:   The patients' QOL was examined using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) and mean changes from baseline in EPIC domains were evaluated. A total of 215 patients from a randomised multi-institutional trial of RT, with or without hydrogel spacer, with a QOL endpoint were pooled with 165 non-randomised patients from a single institution with prospective QOL collection in patients with or without hydrogel spacer. The proportions of men with minimally important differences (MIDs) relative to pre-treatment baseline in the bowel domain were tested using repeated measure logistic models with a pre-specified threshold for clinically significant declines (≥5 equivalent to MIDx1 and ≥10 equivalent to MIDx2).  Results:   A total of 380 men were evaluated (64% with spacer and 36% without) with QOL data being available for 199 men with >24 months of follow-up [median (range) 39.5 (31-71.4) months]. Treatment with spacer was associated with less decline in average long-term bowel QOL (89.4 for control and 94.7 for spacer) with differences at >24 months meeting the threshold of a MID difference between cohorts (bowel score difference from baseline: control = -5.1, spacer = 0.3, difference = -5.4; P < 0.001). When evaluated over time men without spacer were more likely to have MIDx1 (5 points) declines in bowel QOL (P = 0.01). At long-term follow-up MIDx1 was 36% without spacer vs 14% with spacer (P <0.001; odds ratio [OR] 3.5, 95% CI 1.7-6.9) while MIDx2 was seen in 19% vs 6% (P = 0.008; OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.4-9.1). The use of spacer was associated with less urgency with bowel movements (P = 0.002) and fewer loose stools (P = 0.009), as well as less bother with urgency (P = 0.007) and frequency of bowel movements (P = 0.009).  Conclusions:   In this pooled analysis of QOL after prostate RT with up to 5 years of follow-up, use of a rectal spacer was associated with preservation of bowel QOL.

Early-stage PCa and late-stage PCa are dependent on androgen signaling, and inhibitors of the androgen receptor (AR) axis represent the standard therapy. Here, we studied in detail the global impact of darolutamide, a newly approved AR antagonist, on the transcriptome and AR-bound cistrome in two PCa cell models. Darolutamide strongly depleted the AR from gene regulatory regions and abolished AR-driven transcriptional signaling. Enhancer activation was blocked at the chromatin level as evaluated by H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac), H3K4 monomethylation (H3K4me1), and FOXA1, MED1, and BRD4 binding. We identified genomic regions with high affinities for the AR in androgen-stimulated, but also in androgen-depleted conditions. A similar AR affinity pattern was observed in healthy and PCa tissue samples. High FOXA1, BRD4, H3K27ac, and H3K4me1 levels were found to mark regions showing AR binding in the hormone-depleted setting. Conversely, low FOXA1, BRD4, and H3K27ac levels were observed at regulatory sites that responded strongly to androgen stimulation, and AR interactions at these sites were blocked by darolutamide. Beside marked loss of AR occupancy, FOXA1 recruitment to chromatin was also clearly reduced after darolutamide treatment. We furthermore identified numerous androgen-regulated super-enhancers (SEs) that were associated with hallmark androgen and cell proliferation-associated gene sets. Importantly, these SEs are also active in PCa tissues and sensitive to darolutamide treatment in our models. Our findings demonstrate that darolutamide is a potent AR antagonist blocking genome-wide AR enhancer and SE activation, and downstream transcription. We also show the existence of a dynamic AR cistrome that depends on the androgen levels and on high AR affinity regions present in PCa cell lines and also in tissue samples.""","""['Simon J Baumgart', 'Ekaterina Nevedomskaya', 'Ralf Lesche', 'Richard Newman', 'Dominik Mumberg', 'Bernard Haendler']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Oncol""","""['Crosstalk between androgen and pro-inflammatory signaling remodels androgen receptor and NF-κB cistrome to reprogram the prostate cancer cell transcriptome.', 'Moving Towards Precision Urologic Oncology: Targeting Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer and Mutated Forms of the Androgen Receptor Using the Novel Inhibitor Darolutamide (ODM-201).', 'Three-tiered role of the pioneer factor GATA2 in promoting androgen-dependent gene expression in prostate cancer.', 'Modulation of androgen receptor by FOXA1 and FOXO1 factors in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor enhancer usage and the chromatin regulatory landscape in human prostate cancers.', 'Super-enhancers complexes zoom in transcription in cancer.', 'LSD1 Inhibition Disrupts Super-Enhancer-Driven Oncogenic Transcriptional Programs in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Comparative Proteomic and Transcriptomic Analysis of the Impact of Androgen Stimulation and Darolutamide Inhibition.', 'The evolution and polymorphism of mono-amino acid repeats in androgen receptor and their regulatory role in health and disease.', 'The synergistic interaction landscape of chromatin regulators reveals their epigenetic regulation mechanisms across five cancer cell lines.']"""

Methods:   We included 173 patients who underwent RARP with extended pelvic LN dissection without neoadjuvant therapy at our hospital between October 2010 and April 2018. BCR was defined as prostate serum antigen (PSA) levels ≥ 0.2 ng/mL; BCR-free survival rates were determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis. We used Cox regression analysis to evaluate effects of PSA and pathologic variables on BCR.  Results:   Median follow-up was 27.9 (range 6.1-86.9) months. Five-year BCR-free survival was 89.5%. In multivariate analysis, positive LNs (HR 7.117; 95% CI 2.826-17.925; P < 0.001) and Gleason score (GS) ≥ 8 (HR 2.612; 95% CI 1.051-6.489; P = 0.039) were significant predictors of BCR. Patients with 1 or 2 positive LNs (n = 10) had significantly higher BCR-free survival rates than patients with ≥ 3 positive LNs (n = 5). We, therefore, stratified the patients as low-risk (GS < 8 and no positive LNs), intermediate-risk: (either GS ≥ 8 or positive LNs) and high-risk (both GS ≥ 8 and positive LNs). Their 1-year BCR-free survival rates were low-risk: 94.6%, intermediate-risk: 88.5%, and high-risk: 33.3% (P < 0.05).

We find no evidence of neoplastic features in BPH: no evidence of driver genomic alterations, including low coding mutation rates, mutational signatures consistent with aging tissues, minimal copy number alterations, and no genomic rearrangements. At the epigenetic level, global hypermethylation is the dominant process. Integrating transcriptional and methylation signatures identifies two BPH subgroups with distinct clinical features and signaling pathways, validated in two independent cohorts.

Yet, the implications of PSMA PET-derived whole-body tumor volume for overall survival are poorly elucidated to date. This might be because semiautomated quantification of whole-body tumor volume as a PSMA PET biomarker is an unmet clinical challenge. Therefore, in the present study we propose and evaluate a software that enables the semiautomated quantification of PSMA PET biomarkers such as whole-body tumor volume. Methods: The proposed quantification is implemented as a research prototype. PSMA-accumulating foci were automatically segmented by a percental threshold (50% of local SUVmax). Neural networks were trained to segment organs in PET/CT acquisitions (training CTs: 8,632, validation CTs: 53). Thereby, PSMA foci within organs of physiologic PSMA uptake were semiautomatically excluded from the analysis. Pretherapeutic PSMA PET/CTs of 40 consecutive patients treated with 177Lu-PSMA-617 were evaluated in this analysis. The whole-body tumor volume (PSMATV50), SUVmax, SUVmean, and other whole-body imaging biomarkers were calculated for each patient. Semiautomatically derived results were compared with manual readings in a subcohort (by 1 nuclear medicine physician). Additionally, an interobserver evaluation of the semiautomated approach was performed in a subcohort (by 2 nuclear medicine physicians). Results: Manually and semiautomatically derived PSMA metrics were highly correlated (PSMATV50: R2 = 1.000, P < 0.001; SUVmax: R2 = 0.988, P < 0.001). The interobserver agreement of the semiautomated workflow was also high (PSMATV50: R2 = 1.000, P < 0.001, interclass correlation coefficient = 1.000; SUVmax: R2 = 0.988, P < 0.001, interclass correlation coefficient = 0.997).

The issue of PCa screening in the general population has been debated following the publication of international European (ERSPC) and North American (PLCO) studies. There is currently no organised PCa screening. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the practice of PCa screening in the French population with no history of cancer between 2005 and 2016.  Methods:   Since 2005, the EDIFICE surveys have focused on the knowledge and behaviour of French people with regard to cancer screening. The practice of screening was evaluated according to the answer to the question: ""Have you ever done PCa screening?"" Responses were analysed according to age, socio-professional category and level of social precariousness.  Results:   After a strong increase between 2005 and 2008 (from 36% to 49%, P≤0.01), a significant decrease in the reported PCa screening rate was observed between 2014 (49%) and 2016 (42%; P=0.02). This decrease was mainly reflected in the socially advantaged categories and in the youngest age group (50-54 years). Screening practices remain the same in older men.  Conclusion:   The perception of the effectiveness of PCa screening could explain the changes of behavior in the French population. This decrease in participation in PCa screening requires monitoring to avoid a general loss of confidence in cancer screening.

Recently, we discovered that loss of giantin function as the primary Golgi targeting site for endoplasmic reticulum-derived transport vesicles in aggressive prostate cancer cells caused a shift of the Golgi localization site of α-mannosidase 1A to 130 KDa Golgi matrix protein (GM130)-65 KDa Golgi reassembly-stacking protein (GRASP65) site resulting in emergence of high mannose N-glycans on trans-Golgi enzymes and cell surface glycoproteins. To extend this observation, we isolated two cell clones (Clone 1 and Clone 2) from high passage LNCaP cells, which exhibited androgen refractory property missing in low passage LNCaP cells, and characterized their malignant property. We have found that comparing to Clone 2, which does not have cell surface high mannose N-glycans and exhibits localization of α-mannosidase 1A at giantin site, Clone 1 displays cell surface high mannose N-glycans, exhibits localization of α-mannosidase 1A at GM130-GRASP65 site, and shows a faster rate of closing the wound in a wound healing assay.

In this study, we aimed to develop δ-catenin antibody-conjugated magnetic beads that can be used for quantitation of δ-catenin by bead-based multiplex assay. δ-catenin level from HEK293T and CWR22Rv-1 cell lysates was quantified to determine whether the antibody-conjugatedmagnetic bead can be used for the detection of trace amounts of δ-catenin.

From a pathological perspective, CaMKK2 plays a role in obesity, diabetes, and prostate cancer. Therefore, CaMKK2 is an attractive target protein for drug design. Here, we tried to find new CaMKK2 inhibitors by using ligand-based and structure-based drug design approaches. From the in silico hit compounds, we identified new inhibitors by using a CaMKK2 kinase assay. We solved X-ray crystallography structures of the CaMKK2-inhibitor complexes and performed Fragment Molecular Orbital (FMO) calculations to analyze the protein-ligand interactions, identify the key residues in inhibitor binding, and quantitatively measure their contribution. We experimentally determined five CaMKK2-inhibitor structures and calculated the binding energies of the inhibitors by the FMO method plus MM-PBSA (Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area) approach. The results showed a high correlation (R = -0.89) between experimentally measured inhibitory activity (pIC50) and the predicted ligand binding energy. We then quantitatively evaluated the contribution of each binding site residue in CaMKK2 by the IFIE (Inter-fragment Interaction Energy)/PIEDA (Pair Interaction Energy Decomposition Analysis) method. The IFIE values indicated that Lys194 and Glu236, which formed hydrogen bonds with the carboxylate groups of the inhibitors, were key residues for ligand binding. PIEDA revealed that the dispersion interaction of inhibitors with hydrophobic residues, such as Ile171, Phe267, and Leu319, contributed highly to ligand binding; we considered that this was due to CH-π interactions with methoxy groups and/or aromatic rings contained in our CaMKK2 inhibitor. These results from the quantitative interaction analysis by the FMO method are useful not only for future CaMMK2 inhibitor development but for application of the FMO method to in silico drug design.""","""['Daisuke Takaya', 'Hideaki Niwa', 'Junko Mikuni', 'Kana Nakamura', 'Noriko Handa', 'Akiko Tanaka', 'Shigeyuki Yokoyama', 'Teruki Honma']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Mol Graph Model""","""['Protein-ligand binding affinity prediction of cyclin-dependent kinase-2 inhibitors by dynamically averaged fragment molecular orbital-based interaction energy.', 'CaMKK2 kinase domain interacts with the autoinhibitory region through the N-terminal lobe including the RP insert.', 'Prediction of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 inhibitor potency using the fragment molecular orbital method.', 'Analyzing GPCR-Ligand Interactions with the Fragment Molecular Orbital (FMO) Method.', 'The role of CaMKK2 in Golgi-associated vesicle trafficking.', 'Nanopore sensors for single molecular protein detection: Research progress based on computer simulations.', 'Molecular Modeling Insights into the Structure and Behavior of Integrins: A Review.', '1,4-Dideoxy-1,4-imino-D- and L-lyxitol-based inhibitors bind to Golgi α-mannosidase II in different protonation forms.', 'Systemic Ablation of Camkk2 Impairs Metastatic Colonization and Improves Insulin Sensitivity in TRAMP Mice: Evidence for Cancer Cell-Extrinsic CAMKK2 Functions in Prostate Cancer.', 'Regulation and role of CAMKK2 in prostate cancer.']"""

However, studies found the occurrences of several side effects after applying these therapies. In current work, several immunoinformatic techniques were applied to formulate a multi-epitopic vaccine from the overexpressed antigenic proteins of PCa. A total of 13 epitopes were identified from the five prostatic antigenic proteins (PSA, PSMA, PSCA, STEAP, and PAP), after validation with several in silico tools.

Lifestyle factors, including physical activity and sedentariness, may be important LUTS risk factors and suitable targets for intervention.  Objective:   To determine whether physical activity and sedentariness are associated with LUTS incidence and progression.  Design:   The Health Professionals Follow-up Study is a prospective cohort of men that began in 1986. Follow-up for LUTS is complete through 2008.  Participants:   Men aged 40-75 years at enrollment and members of health professions.  Main measures:   Total weekly metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-hour scores were calculated and were categorized (< 9, 9 to < 21, 21 to < 42, 42 to < 63, ≥ 63 MET-hours/week). Participants reported their average time/week spent sitting watching television as a measure of sedentariness, which was categorized (< 1, 1-3, 4-10, 11-29, ≥ 30 h/week). Participants completed the International Prostate Symptom Score survey and reported treatments for LUTS periodically. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of physical activity and television watching with LUTS incidence and progression.  Key results:   After multivariable adjustment, including for body mass index (BMI), men with the highest physical activity were 19% (HR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.74-0.89; p trend < 0.0001) less likely to develop incident moderate or worse LUTS than men in the lowest category. Men who watched television ≥ 30 h/week were 24% (HR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.05-1.45; p trend = 0.004) more likely to develop incident moderate or worse LUTS than men who watched < 1 h/week. These associations persisted after mutual adjustment. We observed no associations with LUTS progression.  Conclusions:   In this large prospective study, more activity and less sedentariness were associated with lower risk of incident LUTS independent of one another and BMI. Physical inactivity and sedentariness were not associated with LUTS worsening.

Some studies have found increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and cognitive impairment in patients treated with ADT.  Aim:   Since the uncertainty about ADT and dementia might relate to the genetics of prostate cancer and Alzheimer's disease, we used the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to examine the relationship between genes implicated in Alzheimer's disease and genes implicated in prostate cancer in men with prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   The genomics of 492 prostate cancer cases in the Genomic Data Commons TCGA Prostate Cancer data set were examined.  Results:   Alterations (mutation, amplification or deletion) in prostate cancer gene speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) significantly co-occurred with alterations in Alzheimer's disease gene bridging integrator-1 (BIN1). Alterations in prostate cancer gene spectrin alpha 1 (SPTA1) significantly co-occurred with alterations in Alzheimer's disease gene CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) (p<0.001). The presence of somatic mutations (deleterious and missense/in frame) in SPOP disturbs BIN1 gene expression. SPOP and BIN1 RNA expression in 492 prostate cancer specimens was significantly positively correlated (p<0.001). Increased expression of SPOP in 492 cases of prostate cancer was associated with reduced survival (p=0.00275). BIN1 forms part of a network that interacts with the MYC oncogene, which is activated at the earliest phases of prostate cancer and is linked to disease aggressiveness. Men receiving ADT had tumor with a significantly higher Gleason score (p=0.023). Gleason score and BIN1 RNA expression in 499 prostate cancer specimens were significantly correlated (p<0.001).  Conclusion:   The severity of prostate cancer is determined by the genetics of the tumor itself, possibly at least in part by the interactions of SPOP/BIN1, MYC/BIN1 and SPTA1/CD2AP. Oncologists treats higher grade prostate cancer with more ADT, which serves as a surrogate marker for disease severity. A weakness of our study is that we did not examine Alzheimer's disease or dementia at all in patients with cancer, only co-occurrence of genetic alterations. Nevertheless, our analysis of TCGA data does not support the idea that ADT causes Alzheimer's disease or dementia.""","""['Steven Lehrer', 'Peter H Rheinstein']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Genomics Proteomics""","""['Alzheimer Gene BIN1 may Simultaneously Influence Dementia Risk and Androgen Deprivation Therapy Dosage in Prostate Cancer.', 'SPOP regulates prostate epithelial cell proliferation and promotes ubiquitination and turnover of c-MYC oncoprotein.', ""The Mechanistic Role of Bridging Integrator 1 (BIN1) in Alzheimer's Disease."", 'Clinical and genomic features of SPOP-mutant prostate cancer.', 'The emerging role of speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) in cancer development.', 'Assessment and Management of Cognitive Function in Patients with Prostate Cancer Treated with Second-Generation Androgen Receptor Pathway Inhibitors.']"""

Tumors, however, can create a suppressive microenvironment that decreases NK function. A feature of many tumors is hypoxia (low oxygen perfusion), which has been previously shown to decrease NK function. A high affinity NK (haNK) cell has been engineered to express a high affinity CD16 receptor as well as internal interleukin (IL)-2 for increased antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and activation, respectively. We sought to investigate the tolerance of NK cells versus haNK cells to hypoxia.  Methods:   We exposed healthy donor (HD) NK and X-irradiated haNK cells to normoxia (20% oxygen) as well as hypoxia (0% oxygen) and investigated their ability to kill prostate, breast and lung tumor cell lines after 5 hours. We also used monoclonal antibodies cetuximab (anti-EGFR) or avelumab (antiprogrammed death-ligand 1) to investigate the effects of hypoxia on NK ADCC. Genomic and proteomic analyzes were done to determine the effect of hypoxia on the expression of factors important to NK cell function.  Results:   While HD NK cell cytolytic abilities were markedly and significantly impaired under hypoxic conditions, haNK cells maintained killing capacity under hypoxic conditions. NK killing, serial killing and ADCC were maintained under hypoxia in haNK cells. IL-2 has been previously implicated in serial killing and perforin regeneration and thus the endogenous IL-2 produced by haNK cells is likely a driver of the maintained killing capacity of haNK cells under hypoxic conditions. Activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is not seen in haNKs under hypoxia but is significant in HD NK cells. Pharmaceutical activation of STAT3 in haNKs led to reduced killing, implicating active STAT3 in reduced NK cell function.  Conclusions:   In contrast to HD NK cells, haNK cells are resistant to acute hypoxia. The potent cytolytic function of haNK cells was maintained in an environment comparable to what would be encountered in a tumor. The data presented here provide an additional mechanism of action for haNK cells that are currently being evaluated in clinical trials for several tumor types.""","""['Kristen Solocinski', 'Michelle R Padget', 'Kellsye P Fabian', 'Benjamin Wolfson', 'Fabiola Cecchi', 'Todd Hembrough', 'Stephen C Benz', 'Shahrooz Rabizadeh', 'Patrick Soon-Shiong', 'Jeffrey Schlom', 'James W Hodge']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Immunother Cancer""","""['ADCC employing an NK cell line (haNK) expressing the high affinity CD16 allele with avelumab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody.', 'PD-L1 targeting high-affinity NK (t-haNK) cells induce direct antitumor effects and target suppressive MDSC populations.', 'An NK cell line (haNK) expressing high levels of granzyme and engineered to express the high affinity CD16 allele.', 'The NK-92 cell line-30 years later: its impact on natural killer cell research and treatment of cancer.', 'Natural Born Killers: NK Cells in Cancer Therapy.', 'In vitro models to study natural killer cell dynamics in the tumor microenvironment.', 'Functional crosstalk and regulation of natural killer cells in tumor microenvironment: Significance and potential therapeutic strategies.', 'Addressing Natural Killer Cell Dysfunction and Plasticity in Cell-Based Cancer Therapeutics.', 'Hypoxic microenvironment in cancer: molecular mechanisms and therapeutic interventions.', 'NK cells and solid tumors: therapeutic potential and persisting obstacles.']"""

Sex differences and changes in circulating sex hormones affect human sensory function. In the literature, authors reported this kind of influence for olfaction predominantly in females.  Objective:   To investigate the effects of low testosterone levels on olfactory functions in males, in this prospective clinical study.  Methods:   Male patients diagnosed with prostate cancer were included. Thirty-nine patients with prostate cancer whose testosterone levels were lower than 50ng/dL due to castration, were the study group. Thirty-one patients with prostate cancer who were not castrated with testosterone levels higher than 50ng/dL were selected as the control group. Acoustic rhinometry and peak nasal inspiratory flow tests were performed for all participants; and for evaluation of olfactory function, both groups completed the Connecticut chemosensory clinical research center olfactory test.  Results:   The mean ages of the patients and controls were 69.6±7.2 (57-89) and 66.3±5.8 (50-78) years, respectively (p=0.039). There was a significant difference between groups in terms of testosterone levels (p<0.0001). The multivariate logistic regression revealed testosterone level as the only predictive factor determining the difference between the groups. In terms of olfactory parameters, all scores were lower in the emasculated group (butanol threshold test p=0.019, identification p=0.059, and Connecticut center score p=0.029) There was a significant correlation between testosterone levels and olfactory parameters (p=0.023; p=0.025 for identification and Connecticut center scores, respectively).

Here, KRAS flanking genomic and transcriptomic regions were sequenced in CAsE-PE cells for insight into KRAS amplification. Comparison of DNA-Seq and RNA-Seq showed increased reads from background aligning to all KRAS exons in CAsE-PE cells, while a uniform DNA-Seq read distribution occurred in RWPE-1 cells with normal transcript expression. We searched for KRAS fusions in DNA and RNA sequencing data finding a portion of reads aligning to KRAS and viral sequence. After generation of cDNA from total RNA, short and long KRAS probes were generated to hybridize cDNA and KRAS enriched fragments were PacBio sequenced. More KRAS reads were captured from CAsE-PE cDNA versus RWPE-1 by each probe set. Only CAsE-PE cDNA showed KRAS viral fusion transcripts, primarily mapping to LTR and endogenous retrovirus sequences on either 5'- or 3'-ends of KRAS. Most KRAS viral fusion transcripts contained 4 to 6 exons but some PacBio sequences were in unusual orientations, suggesting viral insertions within the gene body. Additionally, conditioned media was extracted for potential retroviral particles. RNA-Seq of culture media isolates identified KRAS retroviral fusion transcripts in CAsE-PE media only. Truncated KRAS transcripts suggested multiple retroviral integration sites occurred within the KRAS gene producing KRAS retroviral fusions of various lengths.

We discovered thousands of enhancer-promoter, enhancer-enhancer, as well as promoter-promoter chromatin interactions. These transcriptional hubs operate within the framework set by structural proteins - CTCF and cohesins - and are regulated by the cooperative action of master transcription factors, such as the androgen receptor (AR) and FOXA1. By combining analyses from metastatic castration-resistant PCa (mCRPC) specimens, we show that AR locus amplification contributes to the transcriptional upregulation of the AR gene by increasing the total number of chromatin interaction modules comprising the AR gene and its distal enhancer. We deconvoluted the transcription control modules of several PCa genes, notably the biomarker KLK3, lineage-restricted genes (KRT8, KRT18, HOXB13, FOXA1, ZBTB16), the drug target EZH2, and the oncogene MYC.

An Analysis for Breast and Prostate Radiotherapy""","""Purpose:   The limited radiotherapy resources for global cancer control have resulted in increased interest in developing time- and cost-saving innovations to expand access to those resources. Hypofractionated regimens could minimize cost and increase access for limited-resource countries. In this investigation, we estimated the percentage cost-savings per radiotherapy course and increased radiotherapy access in African countries after adopting hypofractionation for breast and prostate radiotherapy. For perspective, results were compared with high-income countries.  Methods:   The cost and course of breast and prostate radiotherapy for conventional and hypofractionated regimens in low-resource facilities were calculated using the Radiotherapy Cost Estimator tool developed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and then compared with another activity-based costing model. The potential maximum cost savings in each country over 7 years for breast and prostate radiotherapy were then estimated using cancer incidence data from the Global Cancer Observatory database with use rates applied. The increase in radiotherapy access was estimated by current national capacities from the IAEA directory.  Results:   The estimated cost per course of conventional and hypofractionated regimens were US$2,232 and $1,339 for breast treatment, and $3,389 and $1,699 for prostate treatment, respectively. The projected potential maximum cost savings with full hypofractionation implementation were $1.1 billion and $606 million for breast and prostate treatment, respectively. The projected increase of radiotherapy access due to implementing hypofractionation varied between +0.3% to 25% and +0.4% to 36.0% for breast and prostate treatments, respectively.  Conclusion:   This investigation demonstrates that adopting hypofractionated regimens as standard treatment of breast and prostate cancers can result in substantial savings and increase radiotherapy access in developing countries. Given reduced delivery cost and treatment times, we anticipate a substantial increase in radiotherapy access with additional innovations that will allow progressive hypofractionation without compromising quality.""","""['Omoruyi Credit Irabor', 'William Swanson', 'Fiza Shaukat', 'Johanna Wirtz', 'Abba Aji Mallum', 'Twalib Ngoma', 'Ahmed Elzawawy', 'Paul Nguyen', 'Luca Incrocci', 'Wilfred Ngwa']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""JCO Glob Oncol""","""['Treatment of Breast and Prostate Cancer by Hypofractionated Radiotherapy: Potential Risks and Benefits.', 'Ultra-hypofractionated versus conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: 5-year outcomes of the HYPO-RT-PC randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial.', 'Hypofractionated radiotherapy in the real-world setting: An international ESTRO-GIRO survey.', 'Practical considerations for prostate hypofractionation in the developing world.', 'Cost Minimization Analysis of Hypofractionated Radiotherapy.', 'Twenty Years of Advancements in a Radiotherapy Facility: Clinical Protocols, Technology, and Management.', 'Expanding radiotherapy access in Sub-Saharan Africa: an analysis of travel burdens and patient-related benefits of hypofractionation.', 'Acute and late toxicity patterns of moderate hypo-fractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Lessons from the Brazilian radiotherapy expansion plan: A project database study.', 'Cost containment analysis and access to treatment associated with adopting hypofractionated radiation therapy from the Brazilian perspective.']"""

The authors hypothesized that better access to care would result in a reduction of high-risk features at diagnosis.  Methods:   A retrospective cohort study was performed of 122,324 men aged <65 years who were diagnosed with PCa within the National Cancer Database. Difference-in-difference (DID) analyses adjusting for sociodemographic variables using linear regression compared PSA levels at diagnosis before expansion (2012-2013) and after expansion (2015-2016) between men residing in states that did or did not expand Medicaid.  Results:   From 2012 to 2016, the proportion of men with PSA levels ≥20 ng/mL increased (from 18.9% to 19.8%) in nonexpansion states and decreased (from 19.9% to 18.2%) in expansion states. Compared with men in nonexpansion states, men in expansion states experienced a decline in PSA ≥20 ng/mL (DID, -2.33%; 95% CI, -3.21% to -1.44%; P < .001). Accordingly, the proportion of men presenting with high-risk disease decreased in expansion states relative to nonexpansion states (DID, -1.25%; 95% CI, -2.26% to 0.25%; P = .015). A similar statistically significant decrease in PSA levels ≥20 ng/mL was noted among black men (DID, -3.11%; 95% CI, -5.25% to 0.96%; P = .005).

Radical prostatectomy is the gold standard treatment for localized prostate cancer but advanced diseases are treated with hormonal therapy. Unfortunately, this treatment is not curative and approximately after 2 years, castration resistant prostate cancer occurs. In this study we aimed to investigate the terminology of castration resistant and refractory, hormone resistant and refractory articles on Web of Science database.  Materials and methods:   We searched the articles in the title section such as castration resistant prostate cancer, castration refractory prostate cancer, hormone resistant prostate cancer and hormone refractory prostate cancer between 1975 and 2018. Categories, publication years, document types, authors, countries, funding agencies and citation reports were recorded in 4 groups.  Results:   There were 6733 articles in the system. Most of the articles (72.16%) were published as using castration resistant title. The United States of America and Italy were in the top 5 countries in 4 titles. Oncology and urology nephrology categories consisted more than 80% of the articles. Of these articles, only 1745 (26%) articles had funding agency.  Discussion:   Different terminology can be used in some diseases. One of these diseases is castration resistant prostate cancer which is referred to different terms such as castration refractory, hormone resistant and refractory. In this study we searched the literature and discussed the results.  Conclusion:   Castration resistant prostate cancer is a serious health problem for clinicians and patients. If international associations, journals and authors use the same terminology, the articles can be published without different titles in the literature.""","""['Selahattin Çaliskan', 'Alkan Çubuk', 'Abdullah Ilktac']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Gulf J Oncolog""","""['The changing landscape of advanced and castration resistant prostate cancer: latest science and revised definitions.', 'Robotic Surgery Research in Urology: A Bibliometric Analysis of Field and Top 100 Articles.', 'Non-steroidal antiandrogen monotherapy compared with luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonists or surgical castration monotherapy for advanced prostate cancer.', 'Targeting Metastatic Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer: Chemohormonal Therapy and New Combinatorial Approaches.', 'Serum Lipids prior to Starting Androgen Deprivation Therapy and Risk of Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer and Metastasis: Results from the SEARCH Database.']"""

Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is the current gold standard for GTV delineation; however, prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography (PSMA-PET) is emerging as a promising alternative. This study compares GTV delineation between mpMRI and 68Ga-PSMA-PET in a large number of patients using validated contouring approaches.  Methods:   One hundred one patients with biopsy-proven primary PCa who underwent mpMRI and 68Ga-PSMA-PET within 3 months before primary treatment were retrospectively enrolled. Clinical parameters (age, PSA, Gleason score in biopsy) were documented. GTV based on MRI and PET images were delineated; volumes measured and laterality determined. Additionally, biopsy data from 77 patients was analyzed. Univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression analyses were performed using concordance in laterality as the endpoint.  Results:   In total mpMRI and 68Ga-PSMA-PET detected 151 and 159 lesions, respectively. Median GTV-MRI (2.8 ml, 95% CI 2.31-3.38 ml) was significantly (p < 0.0001) smaller than median GTV-PET (4.9 ml, 95% CI 3.9-6.6 ml). 68Ga-PSMA-PET detected significantly more bilateral lesions than mpMRI (71 vs 57, p = 0.03). Analysis of patients with bilateral lesions in biopsy showed a significant higher concordance of laterality in 68Ga-PSMA-PET (p = 0.03). In univariate analysis, PSA level and volume of GTV-MRI had an impact on concordance in laterality (p = 0.02 and p = 0.01), whereas in multivariate analysis, only GTV-MRI volume remained significant (p = 0.04).  Conclusion:   MpMRI and 68Ga-PSMA-PET detect a similar amount of PCa lesions. However, GTV-PET had approximately twice the volume (median 4.9 ml vs 2.8 ml) and detected significantly more bilateral lesions than mpMRI. Thus, 68Ga-PSMA-PET gives highly important complementary information. Since we could not find any strong evidence for parameters to guide when 68Ga-PSMA-PET is dispensable, it should be performed additionally to MRI in patients with intermediate and high-risk PCa according to D'Amico classification to improve GTV delineation.""","""['Simon Spohn', 'Chiara Jaegle', 'Thomas F Fassbender', 'Tanja Sprave', 'Eleni Gkika', 'Nils H Nicolay', 'Michael Bock', 'Juri Ruf', 'Matthias Benndorf', 'Christian Gratzke', 'Anca L Grosu', 'Constantinos Zamboglou']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and multiparametric MRI for gross tumor volume delineation in a slice by slice analysis with whole mount histopathology as a reference standard - Implications for focal radiotherapy planning in primary prostate cancer.', 'MRI versus ⁶⁸Ga-PSMA PET/CT for gross tumour volume delineation in radiation treatment planning of primary prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of 68Ga-HBED-CC PSMA-PET/CT and multiparametric MRI for gross tumour volume detection in patients with primary prostate cancer based on slice by slice comparison with histopathology.', 'Diagnostic Performance and Clinical Impact of PSMA PET/CT versus mpMRI in Patients with a High Suspicion of Prostate Cancer and Previously Negative Biopsy: A Prospective Trial (PROSPET-BX).', 'PET-CT and PET-MRI of the prostate : From 18F-FDG to 68Ga-PSMA.', 'Up-to-Date Imaging and Diagnostic Techniques for Prostate Cancer: A Literature Review.', 'A Systematic Review of the Variability in Performing and Reporting Intraprostatic Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography in Primary Staging Studies.', 'Detecting localised prostate cancer using radiomic features in PSMA PET and multiparametric MRI for biologically targeted radiation therapy.', 'Comparison of PSMA-based 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT and pelvic multiparametric MRI for lesion detection in the pelvis in patients with prostate cancer.', 'PSMA-based 18F-DCFPyL PET: a better choice than multiparametric MRI for prostate cancer diagnosis?']"""

Main outcome measure: Budget impact, correct diagnoses, futile treatments, and cost-consequence (cost per correct diagnosis) Results: For a hypothetical hospital serving 500,000 individuals, the model showed the use of 18 F-fluciclovine reduced 'futile' therapies by 19.2%. Re-imaging costs were reduced by 40.2% ($8.2 million); however, when assuming diagnostic and staging costs only, the total costs increased from $31.2 to $34.6 million (10.9%), driven by 18 F-fluciclovine imaging agent and procedure costs.

However, as our understanding of the complex tumor microenvironment grows, there is increasing demand for multiplexed biomarker detection. Currently, multiplexed IHC assays are almost exclusively based on immunofluorescence because brightfield techniques are limited by the broad spectral absorption of chromogens and a reliance on conventional 3-channel color cameras. In this work, we overcome these limitations by combining new chromogens possessing narrow absorbance bands with matched illumination channels and monochrome imaging. Multiplex IHC was performed using four or five covalently deposited chromogens and hematoxylin nuclear stain to preserve morphological context and detail. Brightfield illumination was provided with a tungsten lamp/filter wheel combination or filtered light emitting diodes to provide up to 12 illumination wavelengths. In addition, an automated rapid imaging system was developed, using a synchronized 12-LED illuminator, that could capture images at all wavelengths in under 1 s. In one example, a four-biomarker multiplex assay was designed and used to distinguish regions of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma in non-small cell lung cancer. The technology was also validated with a five-biomarker assay in prostate cancer. Spectrally unmixed images of each biomarker demonstrated concordant expression patterns with DAB single stain on serial sections, indicating faithful identification of each biomarker. In each assay, all chromogens were well resolved by spectral unmixing to remove spectral crosstalk. While further characterization and refinement of the assay, and improvements in automation and user interface are necessary for pathologist acceptance, this approach to multiplex IHC and multispectral imaging has the potential to accelerate adoption of multiplexing by combining the medical value of high-order multiplexing with the speed, pathologist familiarity, and broadly established clinical utility of brightfield microscopy.""","""['Larry E Morrison', 'Mark R Lefever', 'Lauren J Behman', 'Torsten Leibold', 'Esteban A Roberts', 'Uwe B Horchner', 'Daniel R Bauer']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Lab Invest""","""['Chromogenic immunohistochemical quadruplex provides accurate diagnostic differentiation of non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Automated chromogenic multiplexed immunohistochemistry assay for diagnosis and predictive biomarker testing in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Conventional histological and cytological staining with simultaneous immunohistochemistry enabled by invisible chromogens.', 'Multispectral imaging in biology and medicine: slices of life.', 'Comparison of automated cellular imaging system and manual microscopy for immunohistochemically stained cryostat sections of lung cancer specimens applying p53, ki-67 and p120.', 'Quantitative multiplexed imaging technologies for single-cell analysis to assess predictive markers for immunotherapy in thoracic immuno-oncology: promises and challenges.', 'Spatial distribution of CD3- and CD8-positive lymphocytes as pretest for POLE wild-type in molecular subgroups of endometrial carcinoma.', 'Prognostic effect of CD73 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma for disease-free survival after radical surgery.', 'Companion diagnostic requirements for spatial biology using multiplex immunofluorescence and multispectral imaging.', 'An Approach toward Automatic Specifics Diagnosis of Breast Cancer Based on an Immunohistochemical Image.']"""

The purpose of this study was to investigate the early activation of this pathway in men receiving in vivo irradiation immediately before radical prostatectomy for locally advanced prostate cancer. We also investigated cell proliferation index (Ki-67), proto-oncogene (p53) and anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2) levels as potential predictive factors. We selected a homogeneous sample of 20 patients with locally advanced prostate cancer and candidate to radical prostatectomy. To assess the apoptotic pathways, Bax, is studied through immunofluorescence assay, before and after 12 Gy single dose intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) to the prostate, on bioptic samples and on surgical specimens. Moreover, before and after IORT, Bcl-2, p53, and Ki-67 were also detected through immunohistochemistry. A count of positive Bax spots for immunofluorescence was performed on tumor cells, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), and healthy tissue areas before and after IORT. We also analyzed Caspases 3 and 9 expressions after IORT. Before IORT, Bcl-2 mean value in neoplastic cells was 2.23% ± 1.95, mean Ki-67 in neoplastic area was 4.5% ± 3.8, and p53 was 22.5% ± 6.8. After IORT, Bcl-2 mean value in neoplastic cells was 8.85 ± 8.92%, Ki-67 in neoplastic area was 7.8 ± 6.09%, and p53 was 24.9 ± 26.4%. After the irradiation, healthy areas expressed significantly lower levels of Bax (2.81 ± 1.69%) with respect to neoplastic cells (p < 0.0001), while in PIN areas, Bax positive cells were significantly more present than in neoplastic areas (p = 0.0001). At statistical analysis, it was observed that cancer cells with Ki-67 ≥ 8% had a trend toward greater expression of Bax (p = 0.0641). We observed an increase of Bcl-2 expression after IORT in neoplastic areas (p = 0.0041).

Here we report that the expression of interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) is increased in primary prostate cancer but decreased in CRPC compared with normal prostate tissue. Decreased expression of IRF8 positively associated with CRPC progression and enzalutamide resistance. IRF8 interacted with AR and promoted its degradation via activation of the ubiquitin/proteasome systems. Epigenetic knockdown of IRF8 promoted AR-mediated prostate cancer progression and enzalutamide resistance in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, IFNα increased expression of IRF8 and improved the efficacy of enzalutamide in CRPC by targeting the IRF8-AR axis. We also provide preliminary evidence for the efficacy of IFNα with hormonotherapy in a clinical study. Collectively, this study identifies IRF8 both as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer pathogenesis and a potential alternative therapeutic option to overcome enzalutamide resistance. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings identify IRF8-mediated AR degradation as a mechanism of resistance to AR-targeted therapy, highlighting the therapeutic potential of IFNα in targeting IRF8-AR axis in CRPC.

Circulating tumor cells (CTC) provide a minimally invasive opportunity for identification and molecular characterization of AVPC. We aimed to evaluate the incidence and clinical significance of compound (2+)TSG losses and genomic instability in prostate cancer CTC, and to expand the set genomic biomarkers relevant to AVPC.  Experimental design:   Genomic analysis of chromosomal copy-number alterations (CNA) at single-cell resolution was performed in CTC from patients with and without AVPC before initiating chemotherapy with cabazitaxel or cabazitaxel and carboplatin. We evaluated associations between single-CTC genomics and clinical features, progression-free survival, and overall survival.  Results:   A total of 257 individual CTC were sequenced from 47 patients (1-22 CTC/patient). Twenty patients (42.6%) had concurrent 2+TSG losses in at least one CTC in association with poor survival and increased genomic instability, inferred by high large-scale transitions scores. Higher LST in CTC were independent of CTC enumerated, clinically more indicative of aggressive behavior than co-occurring TSG losses, and molecularly associated with gains in chromosomal regions including PTK2, Myc, and NCOA2; increased androgen receptor expression; and BRCA2 loss. In 57 patients with matched cell-free tumor DNA data, CTC were more frequently detectable and evaluable for CNA analysis (in 73.7% vs. 42.1%, respectively).  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that genomic instability in CTC is a hallmark of advanced prostate cancer aggressiveness, and support single-CTC sequencing as a compelling tool to noninvasively characterize cancer heterogeneity.""","""['Paymaneh D Malihi#', 'Ryon P Graf#', 'Angel Rodriguez', 'Naveen Ramesh', 'Jerry Lee', 'Ramsay Sutton', 'Rhett Jiles', 'Carmen Ruiz Velasco', 'Emi Sei', 'Anand Kolatkar', 'Christopher Logothetis', 'Nicholas E Navin', 'Paul Corn', 'Ana M Aparicio', 'Ryan Dittamore', 'James Hicks', 'Peter Kuhn', 'Amado J Zurita']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Analysis of BRCA2 Copy Number Loss and Genomic Instability in Circulating Tumor Cells from Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Chromosomal Instability Estimation Based on Next Generation Sequencing and Single Cell Genome Wide Copy Number Variation Analysis.', 'Platelet-Coated Circulating Tumor Cells Are a Predictive Biomarker in Patients with Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Involvement of the multiple tumor suppressor genes and 12-lipoxygenase in human prostate cancer.

Many factors weigh into the decision to proceed with retrograde ureteral stent (RUS), nephrostomy tube (NT), or observation; however, there is no consensus for the optimal approach. The objective of this study was twofold. First, to determine practice patterns by correlating patient, hospital, and disease characteristics to manage MEUO; second, to describe treatment trends of MEUO over time. Materials and Methods: Using the National Inpatient Sample 2010-2015, we abstracted all adults with diagnoses of hydronephrosis and concurrent metastasis or lymphoma, excluding any record with a diagnosis of urinary tract stone. Multinomial regression assessed predictors of undergoing no decompression, stenting, or nephrostomy. Quarterly trends and annual percentage change of MEUO prevalence and percentage decompressed with stent vs nephrostomy were calculated. Results: There were an estimated 238,500 cases of MEUO from 2010 to 2015, of which 18.0% underwent decompression with RUS and 11.4% NT. On multinomial regression, prostate (odds ratio [OR] 1.5), bladder (1.6), cervical (1.6) cancer, academic hospitals (1.4), and acute kidney injury were among factors that most significantly increased odds of undergoing NT. Factors that significantly increased odds of undergoing RUS included colon (OR 1.4), rectal/anal (1.3), ovarian (1.2) cancer, Midwest (vs northeast) hospitals (1.4), and female gender (1.4), whereas decreased odds of RUS were associated with bladder cancer (0.7), nonwhite race (0.8), and weekend admission (0.8). While MEUO prevalence has been increasing on an average of 2.9%/year, decompression rates have been decreasing, driven solely by a decrease in RUS of 3.8%/year on average. Conclusions: There is substantial variation in approach for MEUO among patient, hospital, and disease types, with an overall decline in stenting compared with steady nephrostomy use. Further investigation into best approaches for certain patient characteristics and disease types is needed to standardize care and reduce disparities.""","""['Christopher R Haas', 'Ojas Shah', 'Elias S Hyams']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Stent failure in the management of malignant extrinsic ureteral obstruction: risk factors.', 'Percutaneous nephrostomy vs ureteral stent for hydronephrosis secondary to ureteric calculi: impact on spontaneous stone passage and health-related quality of life-a prospective study.', 'Predictors of antegrade ureteral stenting failure: a single-center experience in patients with malignant and benign ureteral obstruction.', 'Ureteral metal stents: 10-year experience with malignant ureteral obstruction treatment.', 'Management of ureteral obstruction : Value of percutaneous nephrostomy and ureteral stents.', 'Serum creatinine trajectory after drainage of kidneys with bilateral malignant ureteral obstruction: a prospective non-randomized comparative study.', 'Acute kidney injury due to bilateral malignant ureteral obstruction: Is there an optimal mode of drainage?', 'Predictors of nadir serum creatinine after drainage of bilaterally obstructed kidneys due to different etiologies.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging of in\xa0vitro urine flow in single and tandem stented ureters subject to extrinsic ureteral obstruction.', 'Treatment efficacy and prognosis analysis in locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer patients with hydronephrosis.']"""

The kernel of iRank is based on an improved PageRank algorithm with constraints. To demonstrate the validity and the effectiveness of the method, we performed experiments for comparison between single-level omics data and multiple omics data as well as with other algorithms: random walk (RW), random walk with restart on heterogeneous network (RWH), PRINCE and PhenoRank.

The proportion of BRCA2 and ATM P/LP variant carriers in men with aggressive PrCa exceeded that observed in men with nonaggressive PrCa; 18/787 carriers (2.3%) and 4/769 carriers (0.5%), P = .004, and 14/787 carriers (0.02%) and 5/769 carriers (0.01%), P = .06, respectively. Our findings contribute to the extensive international effort to interpret the genetic variation identified in genes included on gene-panel tests, for which there is currently an insufficient evidence-base for clinical translation in the context of PrCa risk.""","""['Tú Nguyen-Dumont', 'Robert J MacInnis', 'Jason A Steen', 'Derrick Theys', 'Helen Tsimiklis', 'Fleur Hammet', 'Maryam Mahmoodi', 'Bernard J Pope', 'Daniel J Park', 'Khalid Mahmood', 'Gianluca Severi', 'Damien Bolton', 'Roger L Milne', 'Graham G Giles', 'Melissa C Southey']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Subgroups of familial and aggressive prostate cancer with considerable frequencies of BRCA2 mutations.', 'Germline Sequencing DNA Repair Genes in 5545 Men With Aggressive and Nonaggressive Prostate Cancer.', 'Prevalence of the HOXB13 G84E germline mutation in British men and correlation with prostate cancer risk, tumour characteristics and clinical outcomes.', 'Genetic predisposition to prostate cancer.', 'Implications of High Rates of Metastatic Prostate Cancer in BRCA2 Mutation Carriers.', 'Comprehensive Clinical and Genetic Analysis of CHEK2 in Croatian Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'The variant rs77559646 associated with aggressive prostate cancer disrupts ANO7 mRNA splicing and protein expression.', 'A Polygenic Risk Score Predicts Incident Prostate Cancer Risk in Older Men but Does Not Select for Clinically Significant Disease.', 'First international workshop of the ATM and cancer risk group (4-5 December 2019).', 'Rare Germline Pathogenic Variants Identified by Multigene Panel Testing and the Risk of Aggressive Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   Study A randomized 45 healthy men to single-dose apalutamide 240 mg alone or with strong inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 (itraconazole) or CYP2C8 (gemfibrozil). In study B, 23 patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer received probes for CYP3A4 (midazolam), CYP2C9 (warfarin), CYP2C19 (omeprazole), and CYP2C8 (pioglitazone), and transporter substrates for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (fexofenadine) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)/organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 (rosuvastatin) at baseline and after repeat once-daily administration of apalutamide 240 mg to steady state.  Results:   Systemic exposure (area under the plasma concentration-time curve) to single-dose apalutamide increased 68% with gemfibrozil but was relatively unchanged with itraconazole (study A). Apalutamide reduced systemic exposure to midazolam ↓92%, omeprazole ↓85%, S-warfarin ↓46%, fexofenadine ↓30%, rosuvastatin ↓41%, and pioglitazone ↓18% (study B). After a single dose, apalutamide is predominantly metabolized by CYP2C8, and less by CYP3A4.

Methods:   We utilized The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other publicly available databases for miRs and mRNA expression in prostate cancer, selected miR-484 and investigated its role in prostate cancer biology and disease progression using in vitro studies.  Results:   Our data mining efforts revealed that increased miR-484 in prostate tumors associates with early disease recurrence, while miR-484 expression in human prostate cancer cells enhances cancer cell mobility. Using RNAseq and bioinformatics, we identified candidate target genes of miR-484 and generated a list of potential tumor suppressors. One candidate in this list was PSMG1. We applied luciferase assays and immunoblotting to confirm that miR-484 directly targets PSMG1. Additional in vitro assays with cancer cell lines showed that PSMG1 knockdown rescued the reduction in mobility brought on by miR-484 inhibition, pointing toward the existence of a miR-484-PSMG1 axis in prostate cancer.

Infected cells adhere to syncytiotrophoblasts or get trapped within the intervillous space by binding to a determinant in a 4-O-sulfated CS chains. However, the exact structure of these glycan sequences remains unclear. VAR2CSA-reactive CS is also expressed by tumor cells, making it an attractive target for cancer diagnosis and therapeutics. The identities of the proteoglycans carrying these modifications in placental and cancer tissues remain poorly characterized. This information is clinically relevant since presentation of the glycan chains may be mediated by novel core proteins or by a limited subset of established proteoglycans. To address this question, VAR2CSA-binding proteoglycans were affinity-purified from the human placenta, tumor tissues and cancer cells and analyzed through a specialized glycoproteomics workflow. We show that VAR2CSA-reactive CS chains associate with a heterogenous group of proteoglycans, including novel core proteins. Additionally, this work demonstrates how affinity purification in combination with glycoproteomics analysis can facilitate the characterization of CSPGs with distinct CS epitopes. A similar workflow can be applied to investigate the interaction of CSPGs with other CS binding lectins as well.""","""['Alejandro Gómez Toledo', 'Jessica Pihl', 'Charlotte B Spliid', 'Andrea Persson', 'Jonas Nilsson', 'Marina Ayres Pereira', 'Tobias Gustavsson', 'Swati Choudhary', 'Htoo Zarni Oo', 'Peter C Black', 'Mads Daugaard', 'Jeffrey D Esko', 'Göran Larson', 'Ali Salanti', 'Thomas Mandel Clausen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Glycobiology""","""['Placental Sequestration of Plasmodium falciparum Malaria Parasites Is Mediated by the Interaction Between VAR2CSA and Chondroitin Sulfate A on Syndecan-1.', 'The low sulfated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans of human placenta have sulfate group-clustered domains that can efficiently bind Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes.', 'The specificity of the malarial VAR2CSA protein for chondroitin sulfate depends on 4-O-sulfation and ligand accessibility.', 'Structural insights into chondroitin sulfate binding in pregnancy-associated malaria.', 'Designing a VAR2CSA-based vaccine to prevent placental malaria.', 'Mass spectrometric analysis of chondroitin sulfate-linked peptides.', 'Spatiotemporal diversity and regulation of glycosaminoglycans in cell homeostasis and human disease.', 'Oncofetal Chondroitin Sulfate Is a Highly Expressed Therapeutic Target in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Expanding the Chondroitin Sulfate Glycoproteome - But How Far?', 'Chondroitin Sulfate/Dermatan Sulfate-Protein Interactions and Their Biological Functions in Human Diseases: Implications and Analytical Tools.']"""

Pretreatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine reversed ARS- and PAM-induced inhibition of PTPase activity. PTPase inhibition by ARS and/or PAM treatment in both DU-145 and PC-3 cells was associated with prolonged EGFR activation.

Design, setting, and participants:   ARCHES (NCT02677896) was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study in mHSPC patients.  Intervention:   Enzalutamide (160 mg/day) plus ADT or placebo plus ADT.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   PROs were assessed at baseline, week 13, and every 12 wk until disease progression using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Prostate 25 (QLQ-PR25), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P), Brief Pain Inventory Short Form, and EuroQoL 5-Dimensions, 5-Levels (EQ-5D-5 L) instruments. Endpoints included time to first (TTFD) and first confirmed (TTFCD) clinically meaningful deterioration (using predefined questionnaire thresholds) in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and pain.  Results and limitations:   A total of 1150 patients received ADT plus enzalutamide (n = 574) or placebo (n = 576). Baseline PRO scores indicated high HRQoL and low pain, which was generally maintained in both groups. There were no statistically significant (nominal p > 0.05) between-group differences that occurred in both TTFD and TTFCD together for QLQ-PR25 and FACT-P scores.
