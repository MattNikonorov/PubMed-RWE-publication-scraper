Methods:   Medical records of 305 patients treated with RARP were retrospectively reviewed. The patients with postoperative AKIs were dichotomized into early AKI (immediately after surgery) and late AKI (1-7 days after surgery). The impact of AKIs and their risk factors were statistically assessed.  Results:   Early and late AKI were observed in 143 (46.9%) and 12 (3.9%) patients, respectively. Hypertension and console time were independent risk factors for early AKI. Among the patients with preoperative eGFR ≥60 mL/min, the eGFR decline 12 months after surgery was significantly greater in patients with early AKI than that without early AKI (-6.8 vs -3.2 mL/min, P = .02).  Conclusions:   Approximately half of patients developed early AKI after RARP. The patients with early AKI had reduced renal function 12 months after surgery.""","""['Hiromi Sato', 'Shintaro Narita', 'Mitsuru Saito', 'Ryohei Yamamoto', 'Atsushi Koizumi', 'Taketoshi Nara', 'Sohei Kanda', 'Kazuyuki Numakura', 'Takamitsu Inoue', 'Shigeru Satoh', 'Kyoko Abe', 'Tomonori Habuchi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Med Robot""","""['Comparison between ketorolac- and fentanyl-based patient-controlled analgesia for acute kidney injury after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a retrospective propensity score-matched analysis.', 'Comparison of Acute Kidney Injury After Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy Versus Retropubic Radical Prostatectomy: A Propensity Score Matching Analysis.', 'Transperitoneal versus extraperitoneal robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: A prospective single surgeon randomized comparative study.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Robot assisted radical prostatectomy: What are the evidences at the time of a specific funding?.', 'Impact of intraoperative fluid restriction on renal outcomes in patients undergoing robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.', 'Comparison between ketorolac- and fentanyl-based patient-controlled analgesia for acute kidney injury after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a retrospective propensity score-matched analysis.', 'Intraoperative mean arterial pressure and acute kidney injury after robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy: a retrospective study.']"""

Abdominopelvic CT and mpMRI are commonly used for intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer (PCa) staging.  Methods:   Retrospective analysis of the MUSIC registry identified patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RP) between 3/2012 and 7/2018. Patients were classified according to pre-surgery imaging modality. Primary outcomes were operating characteristics of CT and mpMRI for detection of pathologic LN involvement (pN1).  Results:   A total of 10,250 patients underwent RP and 3924 patients (38.3%) underwent CT and/or mpMRI prior to surgery. Suspicion for LN involvement was identified on 2.3% CT and 1.9% mpMRI. Overall, 391 patients were pN1(3.8%), including 0.1% low-, 2.1% intermediate-, and 10.9% high-risk PCa patients. Of 235 pN1 patients that underwent CT prior, far more had negative (91.1%) than positive (8.9%) findings, yielding sensitivity: 8.9%, specificity: 98.3%, negative predictive value (NPV): 92.1%, and positive predictive value (PPV): 32.3% for CT with regard to LN metastases. Similarly, more patients with pN1 disease had negative mpMRI (81.0%) then suspicious or indeterminate MRI (19.0%), yielding sensitivity: 19.0%, specificity: 97.3%, NPV: 95.9%, and PPV: 26.7%.  Conclusions:   Abdominopelvic CT and mpMRI have clear limitations in identifying LN metastases. Additional clinicopathologic features should be considered when making management decisions, as 2.1% and 10.9% with intermediate-and high-risk cancer had metastatic LNs. The majority of pN1 patients had a negative CT or a negative/indeterminate mpMRI prior to RP. Pelvic LN dissection should be performed in RP patients with intermediate- or high-risk PCa, independent of preoperative imaging results.""","""['Henry Peabody', 'Brian R Lane', 'Ji Qi', 'Tae Kim', 'James E Montie', 'Andrew Moriarity', 'Christopher M Brede', 'Jeffrey Montgomery;Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Histological comparison between predictive value of preoperative 3-T multiparametric MRI and 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan for pathological outcomes at radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection for prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET-CT with mpMRI for preoperative lymph node staging in patients with intermediate to high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Do patients who undergo multiparametric MRI for prostate cancer benefit from additional staging imaging?

Methods:   198 patients were randomized prospectively into three groups (May 2016-July 2017): A transurethral catheter with micturition on postoperative day (POD) 5 was placed in the control group (TD5); a suprapubic tube (SPT) with micturition on POD 5 was placed in the group SD5 or with micturition on POD 2 in group SD2, respectively. Questionnaires were used for catheter-related satisfaction. Functional outcome analysis included residual volume analysis, uroflowmetry, IPSS, 12-h pad test, and daily pad use. Follow-up was conducted up to 12 months.  Results:   Postoperative comfort and catheter-related complications were similar in the three groups. However, on the day of catheter removal, continence was significantly better in the 12-h pad test for the SD2 group with 14 ml vs. 30 ml (TD5) and 24 ml (SD5), p = 0.007. Median residual urine volume between the groups was comparable with 17 ml in TD5, 7 ml in SD5, and 11 ml in SD2, (p = 0.07). Postoperative IPSS did not differ significantly in the follow-up period. After 4 weeks, 63% of the patients in SD2 were continent (no pad/day) compared to 33% in TD5 and 41% in SD5, p = 0.004. After 12 months, 76% were continent in TD5, 87% in SD5, and 94% in SD2, p = 0.023.

Current and historical cancer prevalence has increased from 3.3% to 7.8%, and 5.8% to 7.8%, respectively, between 2004 and 2015. Current cancer was associated with increased adjusted odds ratio (OR) of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) [composite of all-cause mortality, thoracic and cardiac complications, and device-related infection; OR 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23-1.30], all-cause mortality (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.35-1.50), major bleeding (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.32-1.44), and thoracic complications (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.35-1.43). Differences in outcomes were observed according to cancer type, with significantly worse MACE, mortality and thoracic complications with lung and haematological malignancies, and increased major bleeding in colon and prostate malignancies. The risk of complications was also different according to CIED subtype.  Conclusion:   The prevalence of cancer patients amongst those undergoing CIED implantation has significantly increased over 12 years.

Diabetic prostate cancer patients suffer from increased lymph node metastasis, tumor recurrence and decreased survival as compared to non-diabetic prostate cancer patients. These patients are also at increased risk for enhanced radiation-induced normal tissue damage such as proctitis. Diabetics are oxidatively stressed and radiation causes additional oxidative damage. We and others have reported that, MnTE-2-PyP, a manganese porphyrin, protects normal prostate tissue from radiation damage. We have also reported that, in an in vivo mouse model of prostate cancer, MnTE-2-PyP decreases tumor volume and increases survival of the mice. In addition, MnTE-2-PyP has also been shown to reduce blood glucose and inhibits pro-fibrotic signaling in a diabetic model. Therefore, to investigate the role of MnTE-2-PyP in normal tissue protection in an irradiated diabetic environment, we have treated human prostate fibroblast cells with MnTE-2-PyP in an irradiated hyperglycemic environment. This study revealed that hyperglycemia causes increased cell death after radiation as compared to normo-glycemia. MnTE-2-PyP protects against hyperglycemia-induced cell death after radiation. MnTE-2-PyP decreases expression of NOX4 and α-SMA, one of the major oxidative enzymes and pro-fibrotic molecules respectively. MnTE-2-PyP obstructs NF-κB activity by decreasing DNA binding of the p50-p50 homodimer in the irradiated hyperglycemic environment. MnTE-2-PyP increases NRF2 mediated cytoprotection by increasing NRF2 protein expression and DNA binding. Therefore, we are proposing that, MnTE-2-PyP protects fibroblasts from irradiation and hyperglycemia damage by enhancing the NRF2- mediated pathway in diabetic prostate cancer patients, undergoing radiotherapy.""","""['Arpita Chatterjee', 'Elizabeth A Kosmacek', 'Shashank Shrishrimal', 'J Tyson McDonald', 'Rebecca E Oberley-Deegan']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Redox Biol""","""['H2O2-Driven Anticancer Activity of Mn Porphyrins and the Underlying Molecular Pathways.', 'MnTE-2-PyP protects fibroblast mitochondria from hyperglycemia and radiation exposure.', 'Manganese porphyrin, MnTE-2-PyP, treatment protects the prostate from radiation-induced fibrosis (RIF) by activating the NRF2 signaling pathway and enhancing SOD2 and sirtuin activity.', 'MnTE-2-PyP Treatment, or NOX4 Inhibition, Protects against Radiation-Induced Damage in Mouse Primary Prostate Fibroblasts by Inhibiting the TGF-Beta 1 Signaling Pathway.', 'Mn-porphyrins as novel molecular magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents.', 'NRF2: A crucial regulator for mitochondrial metabolic shift and prostate cancer progression.', 'A Ten-year-long Update on Radiation Proctitis Among Prostate Cancer Patients Treated With Curative External Beam Radiotherapy.', 'H2O2-Driven Anticancer Activity of Mn Porphyrins and the Underlying Molecular Pathways.']"""

In this retrospective cohort study, we identify provider and patient factors associated with PSA testing, particularly in situations where testing would be low-value.  Methods:   We used electronic health record data from 2011 to 2018 representing 1,738,021 health system encounters in the United States. Using logistic generalized estimating equation models, we examined patient factors (age, comorbid illness, family history, race and prior PSA results), provider factors (gender, specialty, graduation year and medical school rank), and overall time trends associated with PSA testing in low-value and appropriate settings.  Results:   Comorbid illness (odds ratio (OR) 0.0 for 3+ conditions vs none) and no prior PSA testing (OR 0.2) were associated with a lower likelihood of PSA testing in low-value situations, while family history of prostate cancer (OR 1.6) and high prior PSA test results (OR 2.2 for PSA > 6 vs 0-1) were associated with a greater likelihood. Men aged 55-65 years were at greatest risk for PSA testing in low-value situations. The provider factor associated with PSA testing in low-value situations was specialty, with urologists being most likely (OR 2.3 versus advanced practice providers). Internal medicine physicians were more likely to perform PSA testing during low-value situations (OR 1.3 versus advanced practice providers) but much more likely to order a PSA test where appropriate (OR 2.2). All PSA testing decreased since 2011.  Conclusion:   We identified several patient and provider factors associated with PSA testing in low-value settings. Some aspects suggest attention to relevant factors for PSA testing in low-value settings (e.g. comorbid illness), while others may encourage PSA testing in low-value settings (e.g. family history).

The approximations of this radiobiological approach do not allow to consider the important role played by the microvasculature not only in the dose-response of the blood vessels but also of the organs where it is located. To this purpose, we presented a computational model that describes the fluid dynamics of microcirculation when the parameters of the network and the surrounding tissues are affected by radio-induced changes.  Materials and methods:   The effects of the ionizing radiation on the capillary bed are mediated by the inflammatory response. We derived from a literature search the possible morphological and functional variations of the network due to the process of the acute inflammation. Specifically, we considered vasodilation, increased membrane permeability with consequent fluid extravasation and increased wall elasticity. These perturbations to the system were included in a computational model, already able to describe the physics of the microcirculation and its exchanges with the surrounding tissues.  Results:   Two computational descriptions were considered. In the first one, we changed a set of 4 parameters associated with the increased fluid exchange from the health scenario at the baseline to a seriously compromised scenario with the edema formation.

We undertook a Phase 0/I clinical trial to assess its potential for imaging bone metastases in prostate cancer including assessment of radiotracer biodistribution and dosimetry.  Methods:   Subjects with prostate cancer and known or suspected osseous metastatic disease were enrolled into one of two arms: dosimetry or dynamic. Dosimetry was performed with 6 whole body PET acquisitions and urine collection spanning 3 h; normal organ dosimetry was calculated using OLINDA/EXM. Dynamic imaging included a 60 min acquisition over a site of known or suspected disease followed by two whole body scans. Bootstrapping and subsampling of the acquired list-mode data were conducted to recommend image acquisition parameters for future clinical trials.  Results:   Up to 233 MBq (6.3 mCi) of [68Ga]Ga-P15-041 was injected into 12 enrolled volunteers, 8 in dosimetry and 4 in dynamic cohorts. Radiotracer accumulated in known bone lesions and cleared rapidly from blood and soft tissue. The highest individual organ dose was 0.135 mSv/MBq in the urinary bladder wall. The average effective dose was 0.0173 ± 0.0036 mSv/MBq. An average injected activity of 166.5 MBq (4.5 mCi) resulted in absorbed dose estimates of 22.5 mSv to the urinary bladder wall, 8.2 mSv to the kidneys, and an effective dose of 2.9 mSv. Lesion signal to noise ratios on images generated from subsampled data were significantly higher for injected activities above 74 MBq (2 mCi) and were also significantly higher for imaging at 90 min than at 180 min post-injection.  Conclusions:   Dosimetry estimates are acceptable and [68Ga]Ga-P15-041 uptake characteristics in patients with confirmed bone metastases support its continued development.

In general, aberrant thyroid hormone levels are associated with increased cancer incidence. For prostate cancer (PCa) a prospective cohort study indicates that lower thyrotropin (TSH) and higher thyroxin (T4) levels are associated with an increased risk of PCa. However, triiodothyronine (T3) can attenuate PCa progression. Here we show that T3 treatment of human PCa cells reduces cell proliferation, by induction of cellular senescence. Interestingly, we could neither detect an increased expression of p16INK4A nor p21CIP1 cell cycle inhibitors, which are mediators of the two major pathways for senescence induction. This suggests that the T3-induced cellular senescence of PCa cells is driven by an alternative pathway. We show that T3-mediated cellular senescence is associated with increase of DEC1 expression encoded by the BHLHE40 gene and p15INK4B encoded by CDKN2B. Each DEC1/BHLHE40 and p15INK4B/CDKN2B knockdown reduced significantly the level of T3-mediated cellular senescence. The data suggest that DEC1 and p15INK4B are crucial for the T3-induced cellular senescence. In line with a protective role of cellular senescence in cancer, public databases provide evidence linking low DEC1 expression to poor survival of PCa patients. Further we show that the BHLHE40 promoter is responsive to T3 suggesting BHLHE40 being a target gene for the thyroid hormone receptor (TR). Taken together, the data suggest that T3 mediates cellular senescence in PCa cells through induction of DEC1- and p15INK4B -dependent pathway.""","""['Roland Kotolloshi', 'Kimia Mirzakhani', 'Joana Ahlburg', 'Florian Kraft', 'Thanakorn Pungsrinont', 'Aria Baniahmad']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['DEC1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor and a novel target gene of the p53 family, mediates p53-dependent premature senescence.', 'Clusterin, a Novel DEC1 Target, Modulates DNA Damage-Mediated Cell Death.', 'Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 depletion induces cellular senescence via histone demethylation along the INK4/ARF locus.', 'Distinct mechanisms mediating therapy-induced cellular senescence in prostate cancer.', 'Role of differentiated embryo-chondrocyte expressed gene 1 (DEC1) in immunity.', 'The androgen-thyroid hormone crosstalk in prostate cancer and the clinical implications.', 'EIF5A2 specifically regulates the transcription of aging-related genes in human neuroblastoma cells.', 'Prostate gland as a target organ of thyroid hormones: advances and controversies.', '17β-Estradiol Inhibits Proliferation and Oxidative Stress in Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells by Upregulating BHLHE40 Expression.', 'Mechanisms of Androgen Receptor Agonist- and Antagonist-Mediated Cellular Senescence in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Material and methods:   A total of 51,252 patients newly diagnosed with PC from 2007 to 2013, who had no prior diagnosis of cancer or dementia, were included and matched with 209,659 non-cancer control. The screening subset was comprised of subjects who participated in a health screening program. We used Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the relative risk of dementia and dementia subtypes according to the primary treatment for the PC.  Results:   Compared to non-PC matched controls, PC survivors showed slightly higher risk for dementia and Alzheimer disease (AD) only in the screening cohort. While PC survivors who underwent ADT were higher risk for dementia and AD, patients who underwent surgery were lower risk for dementia and AD, compared to the non-cancer population. Compared to surgery, ADT, surgery + ADT, and active surveillance/watchful waiting showed a significantly elevated risk for dementia.  Conclusion:   PC survivors had slightly higher risk for dementia compared to non-PC controls, which might be related to the screening effects of PC. The risk for dementia was most prominent among PC patients who underwent ADT, followed by patients who underwent AS/WW, and those who underwent surgery + ADT.

Objective:   We describe clinical, histological, and radiological outcomes from an established AS programme, where protocol-based biopsies were omitted in favour of MRI-led monitoring.  Design, setting, and participants:   Data on 672 men enrolled in AS between August 2004 and November 2017 (inclusion criteria: Gleason 3 + 3 or 3 + 4 localised prostate cancer, presenting prostate-specific antigen <20 ng/ml, and baseline mpMRI) were collected from the University College London Hospital (UCLH) database.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Primary outcomes were event-free survival (EFS; event defined as prostate cancer treatment, transition to watchful waiting, or death) and treatment-free survival (TFS). Secondary outcomes included rates of all-cause or prostate cancer-related mortality, metastasis, and upgrading to Gleason ≥4 + 3. Data on radiological and histological progression were also collected.  Results and limitations:   More than 3800 person-years (py) of follow-up were accrued (median: 58 mo; interquartile range 37-82 mo). Approximately 84.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 82.0-87.6) and 71.8% (95% CI: 68.2-75.6) of patients remained on AS at 3 and 5 yr, respectively. EFS and TFS were lower in those with MRI-visible (Likert 4-5) disease or secondary Gleason pattern 4 at baseline (log-rank test; p < 0.001). In total, 216 men were treated. There were 24 deaths, none of which was prostate cancer related (6.3/1000 py; 95% CI: 4.1-9.5). Metastases developed in eight men (2.1 events/1000 py; 95% CI: 1.0-4.3), whereas 27 men upgraded to Gleason ≥4 + 3 on follow-up biopsy (7.7 events/1000 py; 95% CI: 5.2-11.3).  Conclusions:   The rates of discontinuation, mortality, and metastasis in MRI-led surveillance are comparable with those of standard AS. MRI-visible disease and/or secondary Gleason grade 4 at baseline are associated with a greater likelihood of moving to active treatment at 5 yr. Further research will concentrate on optimising imaging intervals according to baseline risk.  Patient summary:   In this report, we looked at the outcomes of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based surveillance for prostate cancer in a UK cohort. We found that this strategy could allow routine biopsies to be avoided. Secondary Gleason pattern 4 and MRI visibility are associated with increased rates of treatment.

Our goal was to investigate the association of dietary protein intake with PSA using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (2003-2010) database.  Methods:   After the screening, 6403 participants were included in the study. The interested independent is the dietary protein intake, and the dependent variable is PSA levels, the covariates included demographic, dietary, biological data, and physical examination variables. A weighted linear model and a weighted linear regression model were used to examine the distribution of variables in the covariate differences between the different independent groups according to quartiles. Four models were used to survey the association between dietary protein intake and PSA. We also attempted to find a nonlinear relationship between dietary protein intake and PSA using the GAM model and the penalty spline method and further solved the nonlinear problem using weighted two-piecewise linear model.  Results:   The weighted multivariate linear regression analysis demonstrated that dietary protein intake was not independently associated with PSA levels after adjusting potential confounders (β = 0.015, 95%CI:-0.024, 0.055). However, we found the non-linear relationship between dietary protein intake and PSA, whose point was 18.18 g (per 10 g change).

The World Health Organization currently recommends that intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDCP) should not be factored into the GrG; however, grading of IDCP is controversial, with variability among genitourinary pathologists. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of grading of the IDCP component on the final GrG in prostate biopsies.  Methods and results:   The study included 123 prostate biopsies (12 cores +/- additional MRI-targeted cores) with GrG1-GrG4 invasive carcinoma and IDCP. All cases were graded by a genitourinary pathologist using two different methods: (i) grading of invasive carcinoma only; and (ii) grading of both invasive carcinoma and IDCP. The overall GrG, excluding the IDCP component, was GrG1 in 3% (n = 4) of cases, GrG2 in 37% (n = 45), GrG3 in 52% (n = 64), and GrG4 in 8% (n = 10). When the IDCP component was included in grading, the overall GrG changed in 28 cases (23%). The GrG increased by one grade in 15 of 28 cases (54%), and by two or more grades in 13 of 28 cases (46%). Upgrading was due to comedonecrosis (39%, 11/28), solid growth (4%, 1/28), or an increased proportion of Gleason grade 4 (57%, 16/28).  Conclusions:   Although the GrG was unchanged in the majority of cases, grading of IDCP altered the final GrG in a significant minority of biopsies in this series, and often by more than one grade, which may have important implications for risk categorisation of individual patients.

This study examined health and cancer information seeking, use of internet to find cancer information, and information seeking experiences among breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer survivors. Nationally representative data collected in 2017-2018 from 2 cycles of the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS 5, cycles 1 and 2 were merged with combined replicate weights using the jackknife replication method (n = 373). Regression analysis for three information seeking behaviors (i.e., health information, cancer information, and internet for cancer information) were modeled, including sociodemographic and clinical factors as predictors. In addition, separate regression analysis predicted three experiences of information seeking (effort, quality, and hard to understand) with sociodemographic and clinical factors. A majority of survivors (84.7%) sought health information. Factors significantly associated with seeking health information were gender (p = 0.024), education (p = 0.0021), and income (p = 0.018). Only 38% of survivors used the internet to seek cancer-related information. The only factor significantly associated with using the internet to seek cancer-related information was time since diagnosis (p = 0.0002). The factor significantly associated with difficulty understanding information was annual household income (p = 0.026). This study fills an important gap by identifying sociodemographic and cancer-related factors associated with information seeking behaviors and experiences. These findings highlight a need to tailor information for low socioeconomic status survivors to account for the lack of skills, resources, and motivation to seek information about health and cancer related topics independently.""","""['Stacy N Davis', ""Denalee M O'Malley"", 'Alicja Bator', 'Pamela Ohman-Strickland', 'Shawna V Hudson']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Cancer Educ""","""['Digital Trends, Digital Literacy, and E-Health Engagement Predictors of Breast and Colorectal Cancer Survivors: A Population-Based Cross-Sectional Survey.', 'Negative information-seeking experiences of long-term prostate cancer survivors.', 'Cancer Survivors: What Are Their Information Seeking Behaviours?', ""Cancer survivors' use of numerous information sources for cancer-related information: does more matter?"", 'Understanding acceptability of and engagement with Web-based interventions aiming to improve quality of life in cancer survivors: A synthesis of current research.', 'Self-efficacy to Get Cancer-Related Information or Advice.', 'Patterns of Health Portal Use by Regular Portal Users Among Patients With Cancer: Results From the UWCCC Survivorship Program.']"""

This study aimed to investigate the association of anthropometry at diagnosis with all-cause and PCa-specific mortality and evaluate whether androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) modulated this risk.  Methods:   Associations between body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) at diagnosis and mortality were examined in 242 men with newly diagnosed PCa enrolled between 2005 and 2007 and re-evaluated 10.9 years later. Multi-variable Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine associations of body size variables (using standard WHO cut-points and as continuous variables) with mortality, adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, Gleason score, smoking, diabetes, primary treatment, and ADT therapy.  Results:   A total of 139 deaths (all-cause mortality 6.98/100 person-years) occurred (PCa-specific deaths, 56; other causes, 66; causes unknown, 17). In multi-variable analysis BMI, WC and WHR categories at diagnosis were not associated with all-cause mortality even after adjusting for ADT. While WHR (but not BMI or WC) when included as a continuous variable predicted lower PCa-specific mortality (multi-variable adjusted WHR per 0.1 difference: HR, 0.50; 95%CI 0.28, 0.93), the effect disappeared with ADT covariance and excluding deaths within the first 2 years.  Conclusion:   Our study suggests that central adiposity as measured by WHR may improve long-term survival among men of African ancestry.

AR phosphorylation associates with castrate-resistance, with pARser213 promoting transcriptional activity. We hypothesise that combined pARser81 and pARser213 reduces survival and would benefit from dual-targeting androgen-dependent and Akt-driven disease.  Methods:   Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were performed on matched hormone-naive and castrate-resistant prostate cancer samples. TempO-Seq gene profiling was analysed using DESeq2 package. LNCaP-AI cells were stimulated with DHT or EGF. WST-1 assays were performed to determine effects of Enzalutamide and BKM120 on cell viability.  Results:   Following the development of castrate-resistance, pARser81 expression reduced and pARser213 expression increased. Castrate-resistance pARser81 expression was not associated with survival but high pARser213 expression was associated with reduced survival from relapse. Combined high pARser81 and pARser213 was associated with reduced survival from relapse. pARser81 expression was induced by 10 nM DHT or 10 nM EGF and pARser213 expression was induced by treatment with 10 nM EGF in LNCaP-AI cells. Cell viability was reduced following treatment with 10 nM Enzalutamide and 10 nM BKM120. Eight genes were differentially expressed between hormone-naive and castrate-resistant tumours and twenty-five genes were differentially expressed between castrate-resistant tumours with high and low pARser213 expression.

Higher levels of HDL have been associated with protection in other diseases, however, its role in prostate cancer is not definitive. SR-B1 is up-regulated in prostate cancer tissue, suggesting a possible role of this receptor in tumor progression. Here, we report that knockout (KO) of SR-B1 in both human and mouse prostate cancer cell lines through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing reduces HDL uptake into the prostate cancer cells and reduces their proliferation in response to HDL. In vivo studies using syngeneic SR-B1 WT (SR-B1+/+) and SR-B1 KO (SR-B1-/-) prostate cancer cells in WT and apolipoprotein-AI KO (apoA1-KO) C57BL/6J mice revealed that WT hosts, containing higher levels of total and HDL-cholesterol, grew larger tumors than apoA1-KO hosts with lower levels of total and HDL-cholesterol. Furthermore, SR-B1-/- prostate cancer cells formed smaller tumors in WT hosts than SR-B1+/+ cells in the same host model. Increased tumor volume was overall associated with reduced survival.

Enrichment of disease associated alleles in specific populations could have implications for disease incidence and prevalence. Prostate cancer (PCa) is a disease with well-established higher incidence, prevalence, and worse outcomes among men of African ancestry in comparison to other populations. PCa is a multi-factorial, complex disease, but the exact mechanisms for its development and progression are unclear. The gene desert located on chromosome 8q24 is associated with aggressiveness of PCa. Interestingly, the non-protein coding gene locus Plasmacytoma Variant Translocation (PVT1) is present at chromosome 8q24 and is overexpressed in PCa. PVT1 gives rise to multiple transcripts with potentially different molecular and cellular functions. In an analysis of the PVT1 locus using data from the 1000 Genomes Project, we found the chromosomal region spanning PVT1 exons 4A and 4B to be highly differentiated between African and non-African populations. We further investigated levels of gene expression of PVT1 exons 4A and 4B and observed significant overexpression of these exons in PCa tissues relative to benign prostatic hyperplasia and to normal prostate tissues obtained from men of African ancestry. These results indicate that PVT1 exons 4A and 4B may have clinical implications in PCa a conclusion supported by the observation that transient and stable overexpression of PVT1 exons 4A and 4B significantly induce greater prostate epithelial cell migration and proliferation. We anticipate that further exploration of the role of PVT1 exons 4A and 4B may lead to the development of diagnostic, therapeutic, and other clinical applications in PCa.""","""['Gargi Pal', 'Lia Di', 'Akintunde Orunmuyi', 'E Oluwabunmi Olapade-Olaopa', 'Weigang Qiu', 'Olorunseun O Ogunwobi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""G3 (Bethesda)""","""['Copy number-based quantification assay for non-invasive detection of PVT1-derived transcripts.', 'Long Noncoding RNA from PVT1 Exon 9 Is Overexpressed in Prostate Cancer and Induces Malignant Transformation and Castration Resistance in Prostate Epithelial Cells.', 'PVT1 Exon 9: A Potential Biomarker of Aggressive Prostate Cancer?', 'Linear and circular PVT1 in hematological malignancies and immune response: two faces of the same coin.', 'PVT1: A long non-coding RNA recurrently involved in neoplasia-associated fusion transcripts.', 'Regulation mechanism and pathogenic role of lncRNA plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) in human diseases.', 'Prostate Cancer Genomics Research Disparities in Africa: Advancing Knowledge in Resource Constrained Settings.', 'Targeting PVT1 Exon 9 Re-Expresses Claudin 4 Protein and Inhibits Migration by Claudin-Low Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Prostac: A New Composite Score With Potential Predictive Value in Prostate Cancer.', 'Editorial: PVT1 in Cancer.']"""

Results:   SeNPs were most potent in prostate cancer cells, regardless of whether or not they were androgen-dependent. Furthermore, SeNP stimulation can induce cell cycle arrest and the apoptosis enhancement of prostate cancer cells. Microarray and molecular mechanism studies demonstrated that miR-16 could directly target cyclin D1 and BCL-2 to mediate SeNP apoptosis enhancement.

The primary endpoint was biochemical recurrence-free survival, defined as two consecutive prostate-specific antigen measurements ≥0.2 ng/ml after surgery. The individual quantitative risk score (IQRS) of each amount (primary/secondary/tertiary) of each Gleason pattern (3/4/5) was calculated using the Cox regression model. On the basis of the IQRS, the modified Gleason grade grouping (mGGG) model was developed. As a robustness analysis of the mGGG model, salvage treatment-free survival was also assessed.  Results:   During a median follow-up of 45 months, 229 of 1022 (22.4%) patients developed biochemical recurrence. The IQRS of each Gleason pattern was as follows: primary 5, 1.81 points (hazard ratio [HR] 6.13); secondary 5, 1.37 points (HR 3.92); tertiary 5, 0.87 points (HR 2.39); primary 4, 1.07 points (HR 2.91); secondary 4, 0.79 points (HR 2.21); and any Gleason pattern 3, 0 points (HR 1). Based on the IQRS, the mGGG model was developed, which classified patients into the following five groups: I (3 + 3 or less); II (3 + 4); III (4 + 3); IV (3 + 4 + t5, 4 + 3 + t5, 3 + 5, 5 + 3, and 4 + 4); V (4 + 4 + t5, 4 + 5, 5 + 4, and 5 + 5). The c-index for biochemical recurrence-free survival was significantly improved from 0.655 of the original GGG model to 0.672 of the mGGG model (P < 0.05).

Patients and methods:   Patients were identified from an active surveillance database who had a previously positive transrectal ultrasonography-guided SB followed by a confirmatory biopsy at a single institution between 2006 and 2019. Patients were divided into two cohorts based on confirmatory biopsy technique: SB alone or MRI-biopsy (which included MRI-targeted and systematic biopsies). Cohorts were then matched on age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, number of positive cores on initial biopsy and initial biopsy Gleason grade group (GG). Logistic regression was performed to identify associations with confirmatory biopsy upgrading.  Results:   After matching, 514 patients were identified (257 per cohort). PSA, prostate volume and PSA density prior to initial biopsy, in addition to total number of initial biopsy positive cores and GG, were similar between the matched cohorts. After confirmatory biopsy, 118/257 patients (45.9%) in the MRI-biopsy cohort were upgraded compared to 46/257 patients (17.9%) in the SB cohort (P < 0.001). The rate of negative confirmatory biopsy was 32/257 (12.5%) compared to 97/257 (37.7%) in the MRI-biopsy and SB cohorts, respectively (P < 0.001).

Aging is characterized by low-grade systemic inflammation (i.e., inflammaging) that is often attributed to the progressive activation of immune cells over time, which may play an important role in prostate carcinogenesis. Th17 response is elevated in aging humans and mice, but it remains unknown whether it is increased in prostate tissue or contributes to prostate carcinogenesis during aging. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of age-related Th17 response in PCa cell growth, migration, and invasion.  Methods:   C57BL/6J (B6) mouse was used as an aging animal model and the prostate histopathology during aging was analyzed. Splenic CD4+ T cells were isolated from young (16-20 weeks old) and aged (96-104 weeks old) mice, and cultured in the presence of plate-bound anti-CD3/anti-CD28, with or without Th17 differentiation conditions. The cells were collected and used for subsequent flow cytometry or quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The supernatant was collected and used to treat PCa cell lines. The treated PCa cells were analyzed for cell viability, migration, invasion, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling.  Results:   Aged mice had enlarged prostate glands and increased morphological alterations, with not only increased inflammatory cell infiltration but also increased Th17 cytokines in prostate tissue, compared to young mice. Naïve CD4+ T cells from aged mice differentiated increased interleukin (IL)-17-expressing cells. CD4+ T cells from aged mice spleen had increased Th17 cells, Th17 cytokines and Th17/Treg ratio compared to young mice. Factors secreted from aged CD4+ T cells, especially from ex vivo differentiated Th17 cells, not only promoted PCa cell viability, migration, and invasion but also activated the NF-κB signaling in PCa cells compared to young mice.  Conclusions:   These results indicate that age-related CD4+ T cells, especially Th17 cells-secreted factors have the potential to contribute to prostate carcinogenesis.

LUTS were traditionally attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and therefore the clinical terminology often uses LUTS and BPH interchangeably. More recently, LUTS were also linked to fibrogenic and inflammatory processes. We tested whether osteopontin (OPN), a proinflammatory and profibrotic molecule, is increased in symptomatic BPH. We also tested whether prostate epithelial and stromal cells secrete OPN in response to proinflammatory stimuli and identified downstream targets of OPN in prostate stromal cells.  Methods:   Immunohistochemistry was performed on prostate sections obtained from the transition zone of patients who underwent surgery (Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate) to relieve LUTS (surgical BPH, S-BPH) or patients who underwent radical prostatectomy to remove low-grade prostate cancer (incidental BPH, I-BPH). Images of stained tissue sections were captured with a Nuance Multispectral Imaging System and histoscore, as a measure of OPN staining intensity, was determined with inForm software. OPN protein abundance was determined by Western blot analysis. The ability of prostate cells to secrete osteopontin in response to IL-1β and TGF-β1 was determined in stromal (BHPrS-1) and epithelial (NHPrE-1 and BHPrE-1) cells by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to measure gene expression changes in these cells in response to OPN.  Results:   OPN immunostaining and protein levels were more abundant in S-BPH than I-BPH. Staining was distributed across all cell types with the highest levels in epithelial cells. Multiple OPN protein variants were identified in immortalized prostate stromal and epithelial cells. TGF-β1 stimulated OPN secretion by NHPrE-1 cells and both IL-1β and TGF-β1 stimulated OPN secretion by BHPrS-1 cells. Interestingly, recombinant OPN increased the mRNA expression of CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL8, PTGS2, and IL6 in BHPrS-1, but not in epithelial cell lines.  Conclusions:   OPN is more abundant in prostates of men with S-BPH compared to men with I-BPH. OPN secretion is stimulated by proinflammatory cytokines, and OPN acts directly on stromal cells to drive the synthesis of proinflammatory mRNAs. Pharmacological manipulation of prostatic OPN may have the potential to reduce LUTS by inhibiting both inflammatory and fibrotic pathways.""","""['Petra Popovics', 'Wisam N Awadallah', 'Sarah E Kohrt', 'Thomas C Case', 'Nicole L Miller', 'Emily A Ricke', 'Wei Huang', 'Marisol Ramirez-Solano', 'Qi Liu', 'Chad M Vezina', 'Robert J Matusik', 'William A Ricke', 'Magdalena M Grabowska']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Osteopontin Deficiency Ameliorates Prostatic Fibrosis and Inflammation.', 'The prostaglandin pathway is activated in patients who fail medical therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia with lower urinary tract symptoms.', 'Expression analysis of osteopontin mRNA splice variants in prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Chemokines and BPH/LUTS.', 'Benign prostatic hyperplasia: age-related tissue-remodeling.', 'Increased Circulating Osteopontin Levels Promote Primary Tumour Growth, but Do Not Induce Metastasis in Melanoma.', 'Alterations in the balance of sex hormones may affect rat prostatic inflammation and fibrosis, and osteopontin might be involved in this process.', 'Thromboinflammatory Processes at the Nexus of Metabolic Dysfunction and Prostate Cancer: The Emerging Role of Periprostatic Adipose Tissue.', 'Insights on functionalized carbon nanotubes for cancer theranostics.', 'Osteopontin Deficiency Ameliorates Prostatic Fibrosis and Inflammation.']"""

Background:   Prostate cancer (PCa) is an androgen-dependent disease. Androgen receptor (AR) antagonists (i.e. enzalutamide) have been used for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Exosomes and their contents (non-coding RNA) play an important role in tumor development and progression.  Methods:   Cells were treated with DHT (10 nM) and/or enzalutamide (10 uM) for 24 h. Cellular and exosomal expression of H19 was investigated using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay.  Results:   Our findings reveal that cellular H19 expression decreased approximately 2.3fold in mean upon androgen stimulation of Pca cells. AR blockage using enzalutamide restored DHT effect and we found increased H19 expression (≤ 2.5-fold, p < 0.05) upon the combined use of DHT and enzalutamide compared to control cells. Similar to its cellular effect, DHT treatment also led to declined exosomal expression of H19 (≤ 3-fold, p < 0.0001). Restorative effect of enzalutamide on decreased H19 expression induced by androgen stimulation was not observed in exosomes.

This approach is blinded to individual patient intraprostatic pathology, and unfortunately, has a high rate of false negatives.  Methods:   In this paper, we propose a deep network for improved detection of prostate cancer in systematic biopsy. We address several challenges associated with training such network: (1) Statistical labels: Since biopsy core's pathology report only represents a statistical distribution of cancer within the core, we use multiple instance learning (MIL) networks to enable learning from ultrasound image regions associated with those data; (2) Limited labels: The number of biopsy cores are limited to at most 12 per patient. As a result, the number of samples available for training a deep network is limited. We alleviate this issue by effectively combining Independent Conditional Variational Auto Encoders (ICVAE) with MIL. We train ICVAE to learn label-invariant features of RF data, which is subsequently used to generate synthetic data for improved training of the MIL network.  Results:   Our in vivo study includes data from 339 prostate biopsy cores of 70 patients. We achieve an area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and balanced accuracy of 0.68, 0.77, 0.55 and 0.66, respectively.

Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified a rare luminal population in the mouse prostate that expresses stemlike genes (Sca1 + and Psca +) and a large population of differentiated cells (Nkx3.1 +, Pbsn +). In organoids and in mice, both populations contribute equally to prostate regeneration, partly through androgen-driven expression of growth factors (Nrg2, Rspo3) by mesenchymal cells acting in a paracrine fashion on luminal cells.

Combination therapies that target cancer cells via different mechanisms to overcome resistance have gained increased attention in recent years. However, the optimal drug combinations and the underlying mechanisms are yet to be fully explored.  Aim and methods:   The aim of this study is to investigate drug combinations that inhibit the growth of drug-resistant cells and determine the underlying mechanisms of their actions. In addition, we also established cell lines that are resistant to combination treatments and tested new compounds to overcome the phenomenon of double drug-resistance.  Results:   Our results show that the combination of enzalutamide (ENZ) and docetaxel (DTX) effectively inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells that are resistant to either drug alone. The downregulation of transcription factor E2F1 plays a crucial role in cellular inhibition in response to the combined therapy. Notably, we found that the androgen receptor (AR) variant AR3 (a.k.a. AR-V7), but not AR full length (AR-FL), positively regulates E2F1 expression in these cells. E2F1 in turn regulates AR3 and forms a positive regulatory feedforward loop. We also established double drug-resistant cell lines that are resistant to ENZ+DTX combination therapy and found that the expression of both AR3 and E2F1 was restored in these cells. Furthermore, we identified that auranofin, an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, overcame drug resistance and inhibited the growth of drug-resistant prostate cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo.  Conclusion and significance:   This proof-of-principle study demonstrates that targeting the E2F1/AR3 feedforward loop via a combination therapy or a multi-targeting drug could circumvent castration resistance in prostate cancer.""","""['Jin Xu', 'Xi Yang', 'Dhanraj Deshmukh', 'Hegang Chen', 'Shengyun Fang', 'Yun Qiu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cells""","""['Preclinical Study using Malat1 Small Interfering RNA or Androgen Receptor Splicing Variant 7 Degradation Enhancer ASC-J9® to Suppress Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Niclosamide inhibits androgen receptor variants expression and overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Niclosamide enhances abiraterone treatment via inhibition of androgen receptor variants in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Darolutamide as a Second-Generation Androgen Receptor Inhibitor in the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'SNHG15 enhances cisplatin resistance in lung adenocarcinoma by affecting the DNA repair capacity of cancer cells.', 'Optimization of the Solvent and In Vivo Administration Route of Auranofin in a Syngeneic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and Glioblastoma Mouse Model.', 'Androgen Receptor Signaling Inhibition in Advanced Castration Resistance Prostate Cancer: What Is Expected for the Near Future?', 'Comprehensive analysis of the functional and prognostic value of E2F transcription factors in human prostate cancer through data mining and experimental validation.', 'Upgrade of an old drug: Auranofin in innovative cancer therapies to overcome drug resistance and to increase drug effectiveness.']"""

Proteoglycans, including versican (VCAN), are regulated via cleavage by the proteolytic actions of A Disintegrin-like And Metalloproteinase domain with Thrombospondin-1 motif (ADAMTS) family members. Alterations in the balance between Proteoglycans and ADAMTS enzymes have been proposed to contribute to cancer progression. Here, we analyzed the expression of ADAMTS-15 in human prostate cancer, and investigated the effects of enforced expression in prostate cancer cell lines. ADAMTS-15 was found to be expressed in human prostate cancer biopsies with evidence of co-localization with VCAN and its bioactive cleavage fragment versikine. Enforced expression of ADAMTS-15, but not a catalytically-inactive version, decreased cell proliferation and migration of the 'castrate-resistant' PC3 prostate cancer cell line in vitro, with survival increased. Analysis of 'androgen-responsive' LNCaP prostate cancer cells in vivo in NOD/SCID mice revealed that ADAMTS-15 expression caused slower growing tumors, which resulted in increased survival. This was not observed in castrated mice or with cells expressing catalytically-inactive ADAMTS-15.

Objectives:   To investigate factors affecting SM positivity in patients diagnosed with PCa who underwent RP using the PCa database of the Urooncology Association (Turkey).  Methods:   Patients who underwent RP due to clinically T1c-T3 PCa and who had detailed SM data for the RP specimen were included in the study. Pathological data of 12 core transrectal ultrasound prostate biopsies and RP were evaluated. Patients were divided into 2 groups (SM positive and SM negative) according to SM status after RP. Data were compared between the groups. Factors affecting SM positivity, the number of positive SM sites, and the location of positive SM were separately evaluated with regression models.  Results:   A total of 2,643 patients from 6 different centers (median age: 63 years) with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 7.3 ng/mL were investigated in the study. BMI, PSA, biopsy Gleason score (GS), and perineural invasion (PNI) were found to be independent predictive factors for SM positivity and the number of positive SM locations, respectively (p < 0.05). According to the positive SM location, PSA was found to be associated with positive SM in apex, anterior prostate, and bladder neck locations. Also, according to posterolateral SM status, PNI and nerve-sparing RP (nsRP) rates were 21.3 and 44% for patients with negative posterolateral SM, and rates were 35.4 and 50.6% for patients with positive posterolateral SM, respectively (p < 0.05). In patients who underwent nsRP, positive SM was present in 22.2% of patients who did not have PNI on prostate biopsy, whereas positive SM was present in 40.6% of patients with PNI (p < 0.001). Similarly, 10.9% of patients without PNI had positive posterolateral SM, whereas 17.3% of patients with PNI had positive posterolateral SM (p = 0.031).  Conclusions:   BMI, PSA, biopsy GS, and biopsy PNI positivity were found to be predictive factors affecting SM positivity. The most important factors affecting posterolateral positive SM were biopsy PNI and nsRP, indicating that the nsRP approach may cause positive SM in the posterolateral margin of the prostate (neurovascular bundle location) in patients with positive PNI on biopsy.""","""['Serdar Çelik', 'Güven Aslan', 'Sinan Sözen', 'Haluk Özen', 'Bülent Akdoğan', 'Sümer Baltaci', 'Volkan İzol', 'Zühtü Tansuğ', 'Levent Türkeri;Members of Urooncology Association']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Urol Int""","""['Prognostic significance of perineural invasion in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer.', ""Can perineural invasion detected in prostate needle biopsy specimens predict surgical margin positivity in D'Amico low risk patients?"", 'Prostate biopsy perineural invasion is not independently associated with positive surgical margins following radical retropubic prostatectomy.', 'Positive surgical margin during radical prostatectomy: overview of sampling methods for frozen sections and techniques for the secondary resection of the neurovascular bundles.', 'Perineural invasion detected in prostate biopsy is a predictor of positive surgical margin of radical prostatectomy specimen: A meta-analysis.', 'Predictive Factors for Positive Surgical Margins in Patients With Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'The Effect of Adverse Patient Characteristics on Perioperative Outcomes in Open and Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

We attempted to identify common sites of nodal disease presentation and failure for patients presenting with cT4 prostate cancer.  Methods and materials:   All patients with treatment-naïve cT4 prostate cancer were retrospectively identified. All patients were required to have a confirmed diagnosis reviewed by our genitourinary pathologist and completed baseline staging. Lymph node (LN) involvement and location at diagnosis were reviewed by a genitourinary radiologist. All patients' follow-up scans were also reviewed; based on LN size, imaging characteristics, and progression/regression characteristics on systemic therapy, the locations of sites of LN failure were recorded. For patients who underwent surgery, any pathologically involved LNs and their anatomic locations were recorded. A total of 103 patients met these criteria, with a median follow-up of 8 years (range, 0.5-14 years).  Results:   Rectal involvement by the primary disease was associated with a higher risk of perirectal and mesorectal LN involvement (45%) relative to no rectal involvement (26%) (P < .05). These echelons are typically not covered with conventional pelvic external beam radiation therapy and are not routinely part of pelvic LN dissection in patients treated surgically. Conversely, bladder or pelvic side wall invasion did not correlate with increased frequency of involvement of perirectal/mesorectal LNs (P > .05).

Hence, studies and development of senolytic compounds that induce cell death in senescent cells have recently emerged. Senescent cells are hypothesized to exhibit different upregulated pro-survival/anti-apoptotic networks depending on the senescent inducers. This might limit the effect of a particular senolytic compound that targets rather only a specific pathway. Interestingly, cellular senescence in prostate cancer (PCa) cells can be induced by either androgen receptor (AR) agonists at supraphysiological androgen level (SAL) used in bipolar androgen therapy or by AR antagonists. This challenges to define ligand-specific senolytic compounds.  Results:   Here, we first induced cellular senescence by treating androgen-sensitive PCa LNCaP cells with either SAL or the AR antagonist Enzalutamide (ENZ). Subsequently, cells were incubated with the HSP90 inhibitor Ganetespib (GT), the Bcl-2 family inhibitor ABT263, or the Akt inhibitor MK2206 to analyze senolysis. GT and ABT263 are known senolytic compounds. We observed that GT exhibits senolytic activity specifically in SAL-pretreated PCa cells. Mechanistically, GT treatment results in reduction of AR, Akt, and phospho-S6 (p-S6) protein levels. Surprisingly, ABT263 lacks senolytic effect in both AR agonist- and antagonist-pretreated cells. ABT263 treatment does not affect AR, Akt, or S6 protein levels. Treatment with MK2206 does not reduce AR protein level and, as expected, potently inhibits Akt phosphorylation. However, ENZ-induced cellular senescent cells undergo apoptosis by MK2206, whereas SAL-treated cells are resistant. In line with this, we reveal that the pro-survival p-S6 level is higher in SAL-induced cellular senescent PCa cells compared to ENZ-treated cells. These data indicate a difference in the agonist- or antagonist-induced cellular senescence and suggest a novel role of MK2206 as a senolytic agent preferentially for AR antagonist-treated cells.  Conclusion:   Taken together, our data suggest that both AR agonist and antagonist induce cellular senescence but differentially upregulate a pro-survival signaling which preferentially sensitize androgen-sensitive PCa LNCaP cells to a specific senolytic compound.""","""['Thanakorn Pungsrinont', 'Malika Franziska Sutter#', 'Maren C C M Ertingshausen#', 'Gopinath Lakshmana', 'Miriam Kokal', 'Amir Saeed Khan', 'Aria Baniahmad']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cell Biosci""","""['Distinct mechanisms mediating therapy-induced cellular senescence in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen-Induced MIG6 Regulates Phosphorylation of Retinoblastoma Protein and AKT to Counteract Non-Genomic AR Signaling in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Mechanisms of Androgen Receptor Agonist- and Antagonist-Mediated Cellular Senescence in Prostate Cancer.', 'The androgen receptor-lncRNASAT1-AKT-p15 axis mediates androgen-induced cellular senescence in prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen-deprivation induced senescence in prostate cancer cells is permissive for the development of castration-resistance but susceptible to senolytic therapy.', 'Photoactivatable senolysis with single-cell resolution delays aging.', 'Emerging Therapeutic Approaches to Target the Dark Side of Senescent Cells: New Hopes to Treat Aging as a Disease and to Delay Age-Related Pathologies.', 'Distinct mechanisms mediating therapy-induced cellular senescence in prostate cancer.', 'Senescence of Tumor Cells in Anticancer Therapy-Beneficial and Detrimental Effects.', 'From the divergence of senescent cell fates to mechanisms and selectivity of senolytic drugs.']"""

However, most studies have been conducted among North American and European populations. Prostate cancer mortality appears elevated in West Africa, yet risk factors for prostate cancer in this region are unknown. We thus examined the relationship between obesity and prostate cancer using a case-control study conducted in Accra, Ghana in 2004 to 2012. Cases and controls were drawn from a population-based sample of 1037 men screened for prostate cancer, yielding 73 cases and 964 controls. An additional 493 incident cases were recruited from the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital. Anthropometric measurements were taken at enrollment. We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-hip ratio (WHR) and prostate cancer, adjusting for potential confounders. The mean BMI was 25.1 kg/m2 for cases and 24.3 kg/m2 for controls. After adjustment, men with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 had an increased risk of prostate cancer relative to men with BMI < 25 kg/m2 (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.11-3.13). Elevated WC (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.24-2.51) and WHR (OR 1.46, 95% CI 0.99-2.16) were also associated with prostate cancer.

The data were correlated to pathological and clinical outcomes and compared to Western populations.  Results:   ERG expression and PTEN loss were noted in 123/288 (42.7%) and 91/297 (30.6%) of patients, respectively.

Only ERG expression was associated with grade groups, being more common in the lower grade groups (1-3 vs 4-5; p = 0.04). In contrast to the Western population, PTEN loss foci were more likely to be ERG negative, observed in 81% of tumor foci and patients with PTEN neg/ERG pos were more likely to exhibit biochemical recurrence (OR 2.831; 95% CI 1.10-726, p = 0.03).

Systematic interrogation of 274 splicing-regulatory genes (SRGs) uncovers prevalent genomic copy number variations (CNVs), leading to mis-expression of ~68% of SRGs during PCa development and progression. Consequently, many SRGs are prognostic. Surprisingly, androgen receptor controls a splicing program distinct from its transcriptional regulation. The spliceosome modulator, E7107, reverses cancer aggressiveness and inhibits castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) in xenograft and autochthonous PCa models.

Decision aids are evidence-based tools which are shown to help people feel clearer about their values; therefore it has been advocated that decision aids should contain a specific values clarification method (VCM). VCMs may be either implicit or explicit, but the evidence concerning the best method is scarce. We aim to compare the perceived clarity of personal values in men considering PSA screening using decision aids with no VCM versus an implicit VCM versus an explicit VCM.  Methods:   Male factory employees from an industrial facility in the Northern region of Portugal aged 50 to 69 years old will be randomly assigned to one of three decision aid groups used to support prostate cancer screening decisions: (i) decision aid with information only (control), (ii) decision aid with information plus an implicit VCM, (iii) decision aid with information plus an explicit VCM. Men will be allowed release time from work to attend a session at their workplace. After a brief oral presentation, those willing to participate in the study will fill the baseline questionnaire, plus a 5 point-Likert scale question about intentions to undergo screening, and will then receive the intervention materials to complete. We estimated a total sample size of 276 participants; with 92 in each group. The primary outcome will be the perceived clarity of personal values assessed by the Portuguese validated translation of the three subscales of the Decisional Conflict Scale. Secondary outcomes will be intention to be screened (before and after the intervention), the total score from the Decisional Conflict Scale and the self-report of having or not undergone screening at 6 months.  Discussion:   This study will add to the body of evidence on the role of decision aids to support health preference-sensitive choices and provide further insight on the impact of different methods for eliciting people's values embedded within a decision aid.

However, the prognostic significance of PNI has not been investigated in hormone sensitive prostate cancer (PCa). The objective of this study was to determine the prognostic significance of PNI in hormone sensitive PCa.  Methods:   Two hundred eighty PCa patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) as first line therapy at three centers were enrolled. The serum albumin levels and peripheral lymphocyte count were measured at the time of diagnosis. PNI was calculated as 10 * serum albumin (g/dL) + 0.005 * total lymphocyte count (per mm3). Patients were categorized in two groups using a cut-off point of 50.2 as calculated by the receiver-operating curve analysis. Univariate and multivariate cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate PNI as a favorable prognostic factor for progression-free survival (PFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS). Prognostic accuracy was evaluated with the Harrell concordance index.  Results:   Multivariate analyses identified PNI as an independent prognostic indicator with respect to PFS (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.521, p = 0.001), CSS (HR = 0.421, p = 0.002) and OS (HR = 0.429, p = 0.001). Patients with elevated PNI had better clinical outcomes. The addition of PNI to the final models improved predictive accuracy (c-index: 0.758, 0.830 and 0.782) for PFS, CSS and OS compared with the clinicopathological base models (c-index: 0.736, 0.801 and 0.752), which included Gleason score and incidence of metastasis.

Recently published data using prostate-specific membrane antigen ligand positron emission tomography (PSMA - PET) for re-staging suggest that those recurrences are often located outside the prostate fossa and most of the patients have a limited number of metastases, making them amenable to metastasis-directed treatment (MDT).  Methods:   We analyzed 78 patients with biochemical progression after RP and sRT from a retrospective European multicenter database and assessed the biochemical recurrence-free survival (bRFS; PSA < nadir + 0.2 ng/ml or no PSA decline) as well as the androgen deprivation therapy- free survival (ADT-FS) using Kaplan-Meier curves. Log-rank test and multivariate analysis was performed to determine influencing factors.  Results:   A total of 185 PSMA - PET positive metastases were detected and all lesions were treated with radiotherapy (RT). Concurrent ADT was prescribed in 16.7% (13/78) of patients. The median PSA level before RT was 1.90 ng/mL (range, 0.1-22.1) and decreased statistically significantly to a median PSA nadir level of 0.26 ng/mL (range, 0.0-12.25; p < 0.001). The median PSA level of 0.88 ng/mL (range, 0.0-25.8) at the last follow-up was also statistically significantly lower (p = 0.008) than the median PSA level of 1.9 ng/mL (range, 0.1-22.1) before RT. The median bRFS was 17.0 months (95% CI, 14.2-19.8). After 12 months, 55.3% of patients were free of biochemical progression. Multivariate analyses showed that concurrent ADT was the most important independent factor for bRFS (p = 0.01). The median ADT-FS was not reached and exploratory statistical analyses estimated a median ADT-FS of 34.0 months (95% CI, 16.3-51.7).

This study aims to determine the trends and factors associated with GP consultation, prescribing and referral to other care services amongst cancer patients in the last year of life.  Methods:   A retrospective cohort study of cancer patients who died in 2000-2014, based on routinely collected primary care data (the Clinical Practice Research DataLink, CPRD) covering a representative sample of the population in the United Kingdom. Outcome variables were number of GP consultations (primary), number of prescriptions and referral to other care services (yes vs no) in the last year of life. Explanatory variables included socio-demographics, clinical characteristics and the status of palliative care needs recognised or not. The association between outcome and explanatory variables were evaluated using multiple-adjusted risk ratio (aRR).  Results:   Of 68,523 terminal cancer patients, 70% were aged 70+, 75% had comorbidities and 45.5% had palliative care needs recognised. In the last year of life, a typical cancer patient had 43 GP consultations (Standard deviation (SD): 31.7; total = 3,031,734), 71.5 prescriptions (SD: 68.0; total = 5,074,178), and 21(SD: 13.0) different drugs; 58.0% of patients had at least one referral covering all main clinical specialities. More comorbid conditions, prostate cancer and having palliative care needs recognised were associated with more primary care consultations, more prescriptions and a higher chance of referral (aRRs 1.07-2.03). Increasing age was related to fewer consultations (aRRs 0.77-0.96), less prescriptions (aRR 1.09-1.44), and a higher chance of referral (aRRs 1.08-1.16) but less likely to have palliative care needs recognised (aRRs 0.53-0.89).  Conclusions:   GPs are very involved in end of life care of cancer patients, most of whom having complex care needs, i.e. older age, comorbidity and polypharmacy. This highlights the importance of enhancing primary palliative care skills among GPs and the imperative of greater integration of primary care with other healthcare professionals including oncologists, palliative care specialists, geriatricians and pharmacists.

A multitechnique characterization approach by UV-visible spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy pointed to the effective 'surface decoration' of the gold nanoparticles by HA, resulting in different grafting densities of the biopolymer chains at the surface of the metal nanoparticle, which in turn affected the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles. Specifically, the spectral features of the gold plasmonic peak (and the related calculated optical size), the hydrodynamic diameter and the nanoparticle stability were found to depend on the molecular weight of the HA. The CD44-targeting capability of HA-functionalized gold nanoparticles was tested in terms of antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity. An enhanced inhibitory activity against both Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus was found, with a HA molecular weight (MW)-dependent trend for the HA-capped AuNPs compared to the bare, glucose-capped AuNPs. Cell viability assays performed on two CD44-positive cell models, namely normal human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVEC) and prostate tumor (PC-3) cells, in comparison with neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y), which do not express the CD44 receptor, demonstrated an increased cytotoxicity in neuroblastoma compared to prostate cancer cells upon the cellular treatments by HA-AuNP compared to the bare AuNP, but a receptor-dependent perturbation effect on cytoskeleton actin and lysosomal organelles, as detected by confocal microscopy. These results highlighted the promising potentialities of the HA-decorated gold nanoparticles for selective cytotoxicity in cancer therapy.

However, its suppressor genes and pathways have not been well established. In this study, we show that promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) has a putative tumor-suppressor function in prostate cancer by inhibiting phosphorylation of STAT3. Compared with a benign prostate, high-grade prostate cancer patient tissue was negatively correlated with PLZF expression. PLZF depletion accelerated proliferation and survival, migration, and invasion in human prostate cancer cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrated a novel role of PLZF as the transcriptional regulator of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 that inhibits the oncogenic JAKs-STAT3 pathway. These results suggest that the collapse of PLZF expression by the CCL3 derived from fibroblasts accelerates the cell migration and invasion properties of prostate cancer cells.

In the current study, the authors tested the impact of race on time to SREs and overall survival in men with newly diagnosed, bone metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Methods:   The authors performed a retrospective study of patients from 8 Veterans Affairs hospitals who were newly diagnosed with bone mCRPC in the year 2000 or later. SREs comprised pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, radiotherapy to the bone, or surgery to the bone. Time from diagnosis of bone mCRPC to SREs and overall mortality was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox models tested the association between race and SREs and overall mortality.  Results:   Of 837 patients with bone mCRPC, 232 patients (28%) were black and 605 (72%) were nonblack. At the time of diagnosis of bone mCRPC, black men were found to be more likely to have more bone metastases compared with nonblack men (29% vs 19% with ≥10 bone metastases; P = .021) and to have higher prostate-specific antigen (41.7 ng/mL vs 29.2 ng/mL; P = .005) and a longer time from the diagnosis of CRPC to metastasis (17.9 months vs 14.3 months; P < .01). On multivariable analysis, there were no differences noted with regard to SRE risk (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; 95% CI, 0.59-1.07) or overall mortality (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.73-1.04) between black and nonblack people, although the HRs were <1, which suggested the possibility of better outcomes.  Conclusions:   No significant association between black race and risk of SREs and overall mortality was observed in the current study. These data have suggested that efforts to understand the basis for the excess risk of aggressive prostate cancer in black men should focus on cancer development and progression in individuals with early-stage disease.""","""['Devin N Patel', 'Lauren E Howard', 'Amanda M De Hoedt', 'Christopher L Amling', 'William J Aronson', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Christopher J Kane', 'Zachary W Klaassen', 'Martha K Terris', 'Stephen J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Factors predicting skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Do skeletal-related events predict overall survival in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer?', 'Predictors of skeletal-related events and mortality in men with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer: Results from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database.', 'Burden of skeletal-related events in prostate cancer: unmet need in pain improvement.', 'Managing bone metastases and reducing skeletal related events in prostate cancer.']"""

The hypothesis was that a positive correlation would be identified between preoperative and postoperative SS in patients with undergoing TURP and starting early solifenacin treatment in patients with high preoperative SS would be reasonable. In addition, we aimed to analyze multiple other risk factors for post-TURP SS.  Materials and methods:   A total of 160 patients undergoing TURP were prospectively evaluated and divided into two groups according to their OABS. Those with a score of ≥10 points were Group 1 (G1), and those with < 10 points Group 2 (G2). In addition, patients in each group were randomly further divided into two subgroups: those who were started on 5 mg solifenacin succinate in the early postoperative period (G1/G2 A) and those who were not (G1/G2 B). In additions to SS Preop, perop and at the 3rd-month of postoperatively 14 variable were evaluated. The effects of these factors, surgery and the efficacy of an early medical treatment on the postoperative SS were investigated. LUTS were assessed by International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and SS were assessed by sum of IPSS 2, 4 and 7 questionnaires (Storage, S- IPSS).  Results:   Preoperative IPSS and S-IPSS were significantly higher in G1 (p< 0.001); there was a significant improvement at IPSS, S-IPSS, QoL score, Qmax, and PVR for all groups after surgery. Only preoperative S-IPSS was found to have significant effect on postoperative SS (p< 0.001). There was a significant difference between G1A and G1B but no significant difference between G2A and G2B in terms of SS at postoperatively. In addition to this, prostatic volume was found smaller than non-symptomatic patients in de novo SS patients.  Conclusion:   TURP provides significant improvement in both storage and voiding symptoms. The predictive value of the preoperative S-IPSS on postop SS is significant. These results suggest that 5 mg solifenacin succinate treatment in the early postoperative period may be beneficial for patients with high preoperative SS and may not be beneficial in others.

In previous literature, machine learning models trained on either MRI or ultrasound data have been proposed to improve biopsy guidance and PCa detection. However, quantitative fusion of information from MRI and ultrasound has not been explored in depth in a large study. This paper investigates information fusion approaches between MRI and ultrasound to improve targeting of PCa foci in biopsies.  Methods:   We build models of fully convolutional networks (FCN) using data from a newly proposed ultrasound modality, temporal enhanced ultrasound (TeUS), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from 107 patients with 145 biopsy cores. The architecture of our models is based on U-Net and U-Net with attention gates. Models are built using joint training through intermediate and late fusion of the data. We also build models with data from each modality, separately, to use as baseline. The performance is evaluated based on the area under the curve (AUC) for predicting clinically significant PCa.  Results:   Using our proposed deep learning framework and intermediate fusion, integration of TeUS and ADC outperforms the individual modalities for cancer detection. We achieve an AUC of 0.76 for detection of all PCa foci, and 0.89 for PCa with larger foci. Results indicate a shared representation between multiple modalities outperforms the average unimodal predictions.  Conclusion:   We demonstrate the significant potential of multimodality integration of information from MRI and TeUS to improve PCa detection, which is essential for accurate targeting of cancer foci during biopsy. By using FCNs as the architecture of choice, we are able to predict the presence of clinically significant PCa in entire imaging planes immediately, without the need for region-based analysis. This reduces the overall computational time and enables future intra-operative deployment of this technology.""","""['Alireza Sedghi', 'Alireza Mehrtash', 'Amoon Jamzad', 'Amel Amalou', 'William M Wells rd', 'Tina Kapur', 'Jin Tae Kwak', 'Baris Turkbey', 'Peter Choyke', 'Peter Pinto', 'Bradford Wood', 'Sheng Xu', 'Purang Abolmaesumi', 'Parvin Mousavi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg""","""['Deep neural maps for unsupervised visualization of high-grade cancer in prostate biopsies.', 'Augmenting MRI-transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy with temporal ultrasound data: a clinical feasibility study.', 'Detection of prostate cancer using temporal sequences of ultrasound data: a large clinical feasibility study.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Comparing Three Different Techniques for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Prostate Biopsies: A Systematic Review of In-bore versus Magnetic Resonance Imaging-transrectal Ultrasound fusion versus Cognitive Registration.

Methods:   A retrospective cohort for IIM patients was conducted using the Korean National Health Insurance Service databases. We observed more than 5 years before and after the diagnosis of IIM (2002~2016) to identify IIM patients who developed any malignancy and classified these patients into two groups: the cancer-associated myositis (CAM) group, who developed malignancy within 3 years before or after the diagnosis of IIM and the cancer-not-associated myositis (CNAM) group, who developed malignancy beyond 3 years of IIM onset. The survival rates of the two groups were compared.  Results:   We identified 1072 incident cases of IIM between 2007 and 2011. A total 225 patients of these patients were diagnosed with malignancy. The development of malignancy was frequent within 1 year before and after the time of IIM diagnosis. The common sites of malignancies in the CAM group differed from those in the CNAM group: the lung, hematologic malignancy, and the liver were common in both groups, but thyroid and oropharynx followed them in CAM while prostate, stomach, breast, and thyroid followed them in CNAM. CAM patient mortality was worse compared with CNAM patients (log-rank test, p < 0.01).  Conclusions:   Among IIM patients with malignancy, common sites of malignancy were different between the CAM and CNAM groups, and patients with CAM had poor prognosis compared with CNAM patients. Key Points • The malignancies commonly occurred in incident idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) patients, especially within 1 year before and after the initial IIM diagnosis. • Patients with malignancy had poor survival compared with patients without malignancy. • Among the IIM patients with malignancy, patients who developed malignancy within 3 years of IIM diagnosis (cancer-associated myositis, or CAM, group) showed higher mortality than cancer-not-associated myositis, CNAM group. • We also found that the common types of malignancy were different between the CAM and CNAM groups.""","""['Yoon-Kyoung Sung#', 'Sun-Young Jung#', 'Hyoungyoung Kim', 'Seongmi Choi', 'Seul Gi Im', 'Eom Ji Cha', 'Eun Jin Jang', 'Dae-Hyun Yoo', 'Soo-Kyung Cho']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Rheumatol""","""['Genetic Influences in Cancer-Associated Myositis.', 'Increased risk of malignancy in patients aged over 50 with idiopathic inflammatory myositis compared to patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.', 'Long-term risks of malignancy in myositis-specific antibody-positive idiopathic inflammatory myopathy.', 'Overall and site-specific cancer before and after diagnosis of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies: A nationwide study 2002-2016.', 'Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathies and Malignancy: a Comprehensive Review.', 'Machine Learning Algorithms Identify Clinical Subtypes and Cancer in Anti-TIF1γ+ Myositis: A Longitudinal Study of 87 Patients.', 'Immune responses to CCAR1 and other dermatomyositis autoantigens are associated with attenuated cancer emergence.']"""

The aim was to assess feasibility, safety and the role of G8 and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) questionnaires in predicting patients' QoL, evaluated by patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).  Methods:   Two groups of patients with localized prostate cancer or abdominal-pelvic oligometastases were analyzed. SBRT schedule consisted of 35 Gy delivered in 5 fractions. The primary endpoint was to measure the impact of G8 and CCI on PROMs. Both G8 and the CCI were performed at baseline, while the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) for PROMs assessment was prospectively performed at baseline and after SBRT.  Results:   Forty older patients were analyzed. The median age was 73 years (range 65-85). For the entire population, the median G8 score was 15 (10-17) and the median CCI score was 6 (4-11). Concerning the PROMS, the EORTC-QLQ C30 questionnaire reported no difference between the pre- and post-SBRT evaluation in all patients, except for the fatigue item that declined after SBRT, especially in the group of patients with a G8 score < 15 and with age < 75 years (p = 0.049).

However, the non-scalable fabrication, prolonged sample processing times, and the lack of automation, associated with most of the technologies developed to isolate these rare cells, have impeded their transition into the clinical practice. This work describes a novel membrane-based microfiltration device comprised of a fully automated sample processing unit and a machine-vision-enabled imaging system that allows the efficient isolation and rapid analysis of CTCs from blood. The device performance was characterized using four prostate cancer cell lines, including PC-3, VCaP, DU-145, and LNCaP, obtaining high assay reproducibility and capture efficiencies greater than 93% after processing 7.5 mL blood samples spiked with 100 cancer cells. Cancer cells remained viable after filtration due to the minimal shear stress exerted over cells during the procedure, while the identification of cancer cells by immunostaining was not affected by the number of non-specific events captured on the membrane. We were also able to identify the androgen receptor (AR) point mutation T878A from 7.5 mL blood samples spiked with 50 LNCaP cells using RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. Finally, CTCs were detected in 8 out of 8 samples from patients diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer (mean ± SEM = 21 ± 2.957 CTCs/mL, median = 21 CTCs/mL), demonstrating the potential clinical utility of this device.""","""['Juan F Yee-de León#', 'Brenda Soto-García#', 'Diana Aráiz-Hernández#', 'Jesús Rolando Delgado-Balderas#', 'Miguel Esparza', 'Carlos Aguilar-Avelar', 'J D Wong-Campos', 'Franco Chacón', 'José Y López-Hernández', 'A Mauricio González-Treviño', 'José R Yee-de León', 'Jorge L Zamora-Mendoza', 'Mario M Alvarez', 'Grissel Trujillo-de Santiago', 'Lauro S Gómez-Guerra', 'Celia N Sánchez-Domínguez', 'Liza P Velarde-Calvillo', 'Alejandro Abarca-Blanco']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Enrichment and mutation detection of circulating tumor cells from blood samples.', 'High‑throughput and continuous flow isolation of rare circulating tumor cells and clusters in gastric cancer from human whole blood samples using electromagnetic vibration‑based filtration.', 'Isolation of circulating tumor cells using a microvortex-generating herringbone-chip.', 'Functional characterization of circulating tumor cells with a prostate-cancer-specific microfluidic device.', 'Enrichment and Detection of Circulating Tumor Cells and Other Rare Cell Populations by Microfluidic Filtration.', 'Interpretatively automated identification of circulating tumor cells from human peripheral blood with high performance.', 'Membranes for the life sciences and their future roles in medicine.']"""

Prostate cancer cells can also bypass AR blockade through induction of other hormone receptors, in particular the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Here we demonstrate that AKT inhibition significantly decreases cell proliferation through both cytostatic and cytotoxic effects. The cytotoxic effect is enhanced by AR inhibition and is most pronounced in models that induce compensatory GR expression. AKT inhibition increases canonical AR activity and remodels the chromatin landscape, decreasing enhancer interaction at the GR gene (NR3C1) locus. Importantly, it blocks induction of GR expression and activity following AR blockade. This is confirmed in multiple in vivo models, where AKT inhibition of established xenografts leads to increased canonical AR activity, decreased GR expression, and marked antitumor activity. Overall, our results demonstrate that inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway can block GR activity and overcome GR-mediated resistance to AR-targeted therapy.

Here, using an array of approaches, including RNA-sequencing and ChIP-sequencing analyses, immunohistochemistry-based tissue microarrays, and various cell biology assays, we demonstrate that CENPA is highly overexpressed in prostate cancer in both tissue and cell lines and that the level of CENPA expression correlates with the disease stage in a large cohort of patients. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments confirmed that CENPA promotes prostate cancer cell line growth.

Method:   One-hundred and sixteen patients (training cohort: n = 81; validation cohort: n = 35) who underwent prostate MR imaging and confirmed by pathology with newly diagnosed PCa from January 2014 to January 2019 were enrolled. Radiomic features were extracted from diffusion-weighted, axial T2-weighted fat suppression, and dynamic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI of each patient. Dimension reduction, feature selection, and radiomics feature construction were performed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Combined with independent clinical risk factors, a multivariate logistic regression model was used to establish a radiomics nomogram. Nomogram calibration and discrimination were evaluated in training cohort and verified in the validation cohort. Finally, the clinical usefulness of the nomogram was estimated through decision curve analysis (DCA).  Results:   Radiomics signature consisting of 12 selected features was significantly correlated with bone status (P < 0.001 for both training and validation sets).

Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in men and can progress to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) which possesses resistance to androgen deprivation therapy. In this study, we investigated the anti-metastatic effects of DTDQ in DU145 human CRPC cells. The results showed that DTDQ inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of DU145 human CRPC cells. DTDQ suppressed activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 of DU145 human CRPC cells via transcriptional regulation. DTDQ modulates the three major mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), ERK, JNK and p38 that are intimately associated with cancer cell metastasis. DTDQ also down-regulates c-Myc transcription factor of DU145 CRPC cells. Finally, we observed anti-metastatic effects of DTDQ in PC3 human CRPC cells, indicating that repressive effects of DTDQ are not limited to DU145 human CRPC cells.

An Analysis from the PROMIS Cohort""","""Background:   All risk stratification strategies in cancer overlook a spectrum of disease. The Prostate MR Imaging Study (PROMIS) provides a unique opportunity to explore cancers that are overlooked by multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI).  Objective:   To summarise attributes of cancers that are systematically overlooked by mpMRI.  Design, setting, and participants:   PROMIS tested performance of mpMRI and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-guided biopsy, using 5 mm template mapping (TPM) biopsy as the reference standard.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Outcomes were overall and maximum Gleason scores, maximum cancer core length (MCCL), and prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD). Cancer attributes were compared between cancers that were overlooked and those that were detected.  Results and limitations:   Of men with cancer, 7% (17/230; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.4-12%) had significant disease overlooked by mpMRI according to definition 1 (Gleason ≥ 4 + 3 of any length or MCCL ≥ 6 mm of any grade) and 13% (44/331; 95% CI 9.8-17%) according to definition 2 (Gleason ≥ 3 + 4 of any length or MCCL ≥ 4 mm). In comparison, TRUS-guided biopsy overlooked 52% (119/230; 95% CI 45-58%) of significant disease by definition 1 and 40% (132/331; 95% CI 35-45%) by definition 2. Prostate cancers undetected by mpMRI had significantly lower overall and maximum Gleason scores (p = 0.0007; p < 0.0001) and shorter MCCL (median difference: 3 mm [5 vs 8 mm], p < 0.0001; 95% CI 1-3) than cancers that were detected. No tumours with overall Gleason score > 3 + 4 (Gleason Grade Groups 3-5; 95% CI 0-6.4%) or maximum Gleason score > 4 + 3 (Gleason Grade Groups 4-5; 95% CI 0-8.0%) on TPM biopsy were undetected by mpMRI. Application of a PSAD threshold of 0.15 reduced the proportion of men with undetected cancer to 5% (12/230; 95% CI 2.7-8.9%) for definition 1 and 9% (30/331; 95% CI 6.2-13%) for definition 2. Application of a PSAD threshold of 0.10 reduced the proportion of men with undetected disease to 3% (6/230; 95% CI 1.0-5.6%) for definition 1 cancer and to 3% (11/331; 95% CI 1.7-5.9%) for definition 2 cancer. Limitations were post hoc analysis and uncertain significance of undetected lesions.  Conclusions:   Overall, a small proportion of cancers are overlooked by mpMRI, with estimates ranging from 4.4% (lower boundary of 95% CI for definition 1) to 17% (upper boundary of 95% CI for definition 2). Prostate cancers undetected by mpMRI are of lower grade and shorter length than cancers that are detected.

In addition to androgen deprivation, various options are available, such as anti-androgen receptor therapies with abiraterone and enzalutamide and taxane-based chemotherapy. It is still being discussed whether oligometastatic patients should only be treated systemically, or whether they benefit from additional local therapy for the primary tumour. Until mid-2018, there was no evidence-based recommendation to perform local prostate irradiation in newly diagnosed prostate cancer with distant metastases. At best, this could be indicated as an individual decision based on data from retrospective series. Accordingly, there were no recommendations in the guidelines. The data from the STAMPEDE study and the HORRAD study were published in 2018 /19 and clearly demonstrate the indication for local irradiation of the primary tumour in oligometastatic prostate cancer with less than 4 bone metastases.

Objective:   We hypothesized that tomato or lycopene products would reduce the emergence of CRPC.  Methods:   Transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice were castrated at 12-13 wk and the emergence of CRPC was monitored by ultrasound in each study. In Study 1, TRAMP mice (n = 80) were weaned onto an AIN-93G-based control diet (Con-L, n = 28), a 10% tomato powder diet (TP-L, 10% lyophilized w/w, n = 26), or a control diet followed by a tomato powder diet after castration (TP-Int1, n = 26). In Study 2, TRAMP mice (n = 85) were randomized onto a control diet with placebo beadlets (Con-Int, n = 29), a tomato diet with placebo beadlets (TP-Int2, n = 29), or a control diet with lycopene beadlets (Lyc-Int, n = 27) following castration (aged 12 wk). Tumor incidence and growth were monitored by ultrasound beginning at an age of 10 wk. Mice were euthanized 4 wk after tumor detection or aged 30 wk if no tumor was detected. Tissue weights were compared by ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test. Tumor volumes were compared using generalized linear mixed model regression.  Results:   Ultrasound estimates for the in vivo tumor volume were strongly correlated with tumor weight at necropsy (R2 = 0.75 and 0.94, P <0.001 for both Studies 1 and 2, respectively). Dietary treatments after castration did not significantly impact cancer incidence, time to tumor detection, or final tumor weight.  Conclusions:   In contrast to studies of de novo carcinogenesis in multiple preclinical models, tomato components had no significant impact on the emergence of CRPC in the TRAMP model. It is possible that specific mutant subclones of prostate cancer may continue to show some antiproliferative response to tomato components, but further studies are needed to confirm this.""","""['Joe L Rowles', 'Joshua W Smith', 'Catherine C Applegate', 'Rita J Miller', 'Matthew A Wallig', 'Amandeep Kaur', 'Jesus N Sarol', 'Salma Musaad', 'Steven K Clinton', ""William D O'Brien"", 'John W Erdman']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Nutr""","""['Tomatoes, Lycopene, and Prostate Cancer: What Have We Learned from Experimental Models?', 'Low-lycopene containing tomato powder diet does not protect against prostate cancer in TRAMP mice.', 'Dietary tomato and lycopene impact androgen signaling- and carcinogenesis-related gene expression during early TRAMP prostate carcinogenesis.', ""β-Carotene 9',10' Oxygenase Modulates the Anticancer Activity of Dietary Tomato or Lycopene on Prostate Carcinogenesis in the TRAMP Model."", 'Tomato products, lycopene, and prostate cancer risk.', 'The Anti-Cancer Activity of Lycopene: A Systematic Review of Human and Animal Studies.', 'Research Trend and Detailed Insights into the Molecular Mechanisms of Food Bioactive Compounds against Cancer: A Comprehensive Review with Special Emphasis on Probiotics.', 'Tomatoes, Lycopene, and Prostate Cancer: What Have We Learned from Experimental Models?', 'Dietary tomato inhibits angiogenesis in TRAMP prostate cancer but is not protective with a Western-style diet in this pilot study.', 'Dietary Tomato Consumption and the Risk of Prostate Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.']"""

However, existing platforms heavily rely on simple geometries such as grooved lines or cylindrical post arrays, which may oversimplify the complex interaction between cells and nanotopography in vivo. Here, we use electrodeposition to construct finely controlled surfaces with biomimetic fractal nanostructures as a means of examining the roles of nanotopography during the EMT/MET process. We found that nanostructures in the size range of 100 to 500 nm significantly promote MET for invasive breast and prostate cancer cells. The ""METed"" cells acquired distinct expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers, displayed perturbed morphologies, and exhibited diminished migration and invasion, even after the removal of a nanotopographical stimulus. The phosphorylation of GSK-3 was decreased, which further tuned the expression of Snail and modulated the EMT/MET process.

The serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening test has a high risk of false-positive results and overdiagnosis; therefore, it is not routinely recommended. Rather, men are encouraged to make individualized decisions with their medical providers, after being fully informed about its potential benefits, limitations, and risks.  Objective:   This study aimed to describe the development and pilot testing of an interactive Web-based decision aid (DA; Prostate Cancer Screening Preparation [PCSPrep]) for African American men, designed to promote informed decision making for prostate cancer screening.  Methods:   Four focus groups (n=33) were conducted to assess men's reactions to DAs developed in prior studies and gather information to modify the content and format. The pilot test employed a pre-posttest evaluation design. A convenience sample of 41 men aged 45-70 years with no history of prostate cancer was recruited from community settings. Participants completed online surveys before and after using PCSPrep that assessed prostate cancer screening knowledge, decision self-efficacy, decisional conflict, and preparation for decision making.  Results:   Use of PCSPrep was associated with a significant increase in prostate cancer knowledge (49% vs 62% correct responses; P<.001), and men also experienced less decisional conflict (24 vs 15 on a scale of 0-100; P=.008). No changes in self-efficacy about decision making or screening preferences were observed. Most men (81%) reported that using PCSPrep prepared them to make informed decisions in partnership with their provider.  Conclusions:   PCSPrep was an acceptable DA that improved men's knowledge, reduced decisional conflict, and promoted the perception of being prepared for shared decision making.

Purpose To compare diagnostic performance, intra- and interreader agreement, and correlations of MRI-based criteria for assessment of EPE after radical prostatectomy, including EPE grade, European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) score, Likert scale, and capsular contact length (CCL). Materials and Methods This retrospective study included consecutive men who underwent MRI and radical prostatectomy between July 2016 and March 2017. Two genitourinary radiologists independently estimated the probability of EPE by using four MRI-based scoring methods. The diagnostic accuracies and intra- and interobserver agreement were evaluated with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and κ statistics, respectively. Correlations between MRI-based score and histologic extent of EPE were analyzed by using the Spearman correlation coefficient (ρ). Results A total of 301 men (mean age ± standard deviation, 65 years ± 7) were evaluated. A total of 129 (42.9%) men had EPE. The AUC ranges of EPE grade, ESUR score, Likert scale, and CCL for assessment of EPE were 0.77-0.81, 0.79-0.81, 0.78-0.79, and 0.78-0.85, respectively, for the two readers. The Likert scale showed lower sensitivity (68.2% [88 of 129] for reader 1, 72.1% [93 of 129] for reader 2) than did EPE grade (77.5% [100 of 129] for reader 1, 79.8% [103 of 129] for reader 2; P ≤ .04). Intra- and interreader agreement were substantial (κ range, 0.61-0.74) for the four methods, with ESUR score showing the lowest values (κ = 0.61 and κ = 0.63, respectively). EPE grade showed highest correlation with histologic extent of EPE (ρ = 0.53 and ρ = 0.55 for circumferential length; ρ = 0.42 and ρ = 0.55 for radial length for readers 1 and 2, respectively; P < .001). Conclusion Extraprostatic extension (EPE) grade, European Society of Urogenital Radiology score, Likert scale, and capsular contact length showed good overall diagnostic performance; however, the EPE grade resulted in more reliable performance and had the highest correlation with histologic EPE extent. © RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

The purpose of this study is to present objective preoperative assessing indicators to predict the surgical difficulty caused by pelvic anatomic abnormalities during laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP). Methods: Patients undergoing LRP were retrospectively analyzed and separated into ""Common Pelvis"" or ""Difficult Pelvis"" groups according to the preset criteria. The clinical data and pelvic imaging data of the two groups were compared to obtain statistically significant differences. The results were compared and validated in 500 ordinary males.

Results: Of the 145 patients undergoing LRP, 22 (15.2%) were included in the ""Difficult Pelvis"" group. Patients in the ""Difficult Pelvis"" group were more likely to have a narrower, shorter, deeper, more flattened pelvis, greater body mass index, more history of previous pelvic surgery, and greater prostate volume. Moreover, the larger amount of intraoperative blood loss and longer operation time were related.

Contradictory to what one might assume given the androgenic potency of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) there are indications that high DHT levels protect from prostate cancer. We want to determine whether there is a long-term association between baseline levels of DHT and death from prostate cancer.  Method:   During the years 1988 and 1989, 1782 men out of 2400 invited were screened for prostate cancer. The invited men were randomly selected from a background population of more than 27 000 men. Serum levels of DHT were analyzed for all 65 men diagnosed in the trial and 130 controls from the same cohort without any signs of prostate cancer. In this study we evaluate outcomes for the whole cohort (n = 195), the men without clinical signs of prostate cancer at beginning of follow up (n = 130) and men with screening detected cancer (n = 65). The cohort was followed up after 30 years and data from the Swedish Cause of Death Registry and the Swedish Cancer Registry were extracted. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox regression models.  Result:   High DHT levels were positively correlated to a lower risk for prostate cancer death in the entire cohort: HR = 0.44 (0.25-0.77 95% confidence interval [CI]). The positive correlation remained significant for the subgroup analysis. HR for the men enrolled in the study without any clinical signs of prostate cancer was 0.25 (0.07-0.88 95% CI) and for the men with a prostate cancer diagnosis at time of inclusion: HR = 0.50 (0.26-0.94 95% CI).

It is red, lipophilic and naturally occurring in many fruits and vegetables, such as tomatoes. Several growth factors, including insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), play important roles in carcinogenesis and metastasis. IGF-1 is a mitogen that plays important roles in the regulation of proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Binding of IGF-1 to its cognate membrane receptor activates Ras/Raf/MAP kinase signaling pathways, which regulate cell-cycle progression, cell survival, and transformation. Lycopene has its protective effect, which affects multiple IGF-1-activated signaling pathways. Lycopene stimulates apoptosis through intrinsic pathways, by stimulating the pro-apoptotic factor of the mitochondrial cavity such as the Bax/Bak protein (an apoptotic promotor). Although tomatoes are widely consumed in Indonesia, there is no research study about the effect of lycopene on prostate cancer in Indonesia. Hence, this study is conducted to measure the influence of lycopene on the level of IGF-1 in Indonesian human prostate cancer cells.  Materials and methods:   Prostate cancer cells were studied. In this experimental study, cells were taken from patients with Gleason score 6 and divided into 5 groups: 2 control groups and 3 treatment groups, which were given 1 µM, 2 µM and 4 µM of lycopene, respectively. Measurement of mean IGF-1 level was performed by ELISA. A comparative analysis was performed by two-way ANOVA.  Results:   The result showed that there was a significant difference in mean IGF-1 levels in the provision of various concentrations of lycopene and time of observation (p<0.05). Increased level of mean IGF-1 appeared on 2µM dose of lycopene at 48 hours observation and began to decline in 72 hours observation. This happened also on 4µM lycopene at 24 hours observation and began to decline in 48 hours observation (p<0.05).  Conclusion:   Lycopene could be administered as adjuvant therapy for prostate cancer patients to increase apoptosis, and eventually inhibit the progressivity of cancer cells.""","""['Tjahjodjati', 'Suwandi Sugandi', 'Rainy Umbas', 'Mieke Satari']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Res Rep Urol""","""['Effect of lycopene on insulin-like growth factor-I, IGF binding protein-3 and IGF type-I receptor in prostate cancer cells.', 'Lycopene interferes with cell cycle progression and insulin-like growth factor I signaling in mammary cancer cells.', 'Phase II randomized clinical trial of lycopene supplementation before radical prostatectomy.', 'The potential role of lycopene for the prevention and therapy of prostate cancer: from molecular mechanisms to clinical evidence.', 'Potential inhibitory effect of lycopene on prostate cancer.', 'Novel Insights into the Role of the Antioxidants in Prostate Pathology.', 'The Anti-Cancer Activity of Lycopene: A Systematic Review of Human and Animal Studies.', 'Prostate cancer: Therapeutic prospect with herbal medicine.', 'Scientometric and Methodological Analysis of the Recent Literature on the Health-Related Effects of Tomato and Tomato Products.', 'The role of nutritional interventions in prostate cancer: A review.']"""

The emergence of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in late 2000's has further accelerated the discovery of many cancer susceptibility genes. The use of targeted NGS-based multigene testing panels to provide comprehensive analysis of cancer susceptible genes has proven to be a viable option, with the accurate and robust detection of a wide range of clinically relevant variants in the targeted genes being crucial.  Methods:   We have developed and validated a targeted NGS-based test for hereditary cancer risk assessment using Illumina's NGS platform by analyzing the protein-coding regions of 35 hereditary cancer genes with a bioinformatics pipeline that utilizes standard practices in the field. This 35-gene hereditary cancer panel is designed to identify germline cancer-causing mutations for 8 different cancers: breast, ovarian, prostate, uterine, colorectal, pancreatic, stomach cancers and melanoma. The panel was validated using well-characterized DNA specimens [NIGMS Human Genetic Cell Repository], where DNA had been extracted using blood of individuals whose genetic variants had been previously characterized by the 1000 Genome Project and the Coriell Catalog.  Results:   The 35-gene hereditary cancer panel shows high sensitivity (99.9%) and specificity (100%) across 4820 variants including single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions and deletions (indel; up to 25 bp).

In vitro systems offer various possibilities but Xenograft in vivo imaging allows studying complex tasks as tumor progression and drug intervention longitudinal. Herein, we established three canine prostate carcinoma cell lines stably expressing fluorescent proteins allowing deep tissue in vivo imaging.  Methods:   Three canine prostate carcinoma (cPC) cell lines were stably transfected with fluorescent proteins in red, far-red and near infra-red spectrum, followed by G418 selection. Fluorescent protein expression was demonstrated by microscopy, flow cytometry and a NightOWL LB 983 in vivo imaging system. Cellular and molecular characteristics of the generated cell lines were compared to the parental cell line CT1258. Cell proliferation, metabolic activity and sphere formation capacity were analyzed. Stem cell marker expression was examined by qPCR and genomic copy number variation by genomic DNA whole genome sequencing.  Results:   Three stably fluorescent protein transfected cPC cell lines were established and characterized. Compared to the parental cell line, no significant difference in cell proliferation and metabolic activity were detected. Genomic copy number variation analyses and stem cell marker gene expression revealed in general no significant changes. However, the generated cell line CT1258-mKate2C showed uniquely no distal CFA16 deletion and an elevated metabolic activity. The introduced fluorescencent proteins allowed highly sensitive detection in an in vivo imaging system starting at cell numbers of 0.156 × 106. Furthermore, we demonstrated a similar sphere formation capacity in the fluorescent cell lines. Interestingly, the clone selected CT1258-mKate2C, showed increased sphere formation ability.  Discussion:   Starting from a well characterized cPC cell line three novel fluorescent cell lines were established showing high cellular and molecular similarity to the parental cell line.

Components of O. crenata methanolic extract were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The extract's antioxidant activity was assessed by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and ferric reducing antioxidant power procedures and cytotoxicity of the extract was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and lactate dehydrogenase assays. Caspase-3 activity was also estimated. O. crenata methanolic extract shows powerful antioxidant activity. The extract inhibited the propagation of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), human prostate cancer (PC3), human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), and human colon carcinoma (HCT-116) in a dose-dependent manner. O. crenata-treated cells displayed obvious morphological structures distinctive of apoptosis. MTT assay exposed that the extract presented prevention of cell persistence in a dose-dependent means and revealed extremely cytotoxic activity against HepG2, PC3, MCF-7, and HCT-116 with 50% inhibitory concentration values 30.3, 111, 89.6, and 28.6 µg/mL, respectively, after 24 h of incubation. In addition, treatment of HCT-116 with various concentrations of the extract caused the release of lactate dehydrogenase and induction of caspase-3 activity in a dose-dependent way. In conclusion, our findings suggested that the O. crenata extract possesses potent antioxidant, cytotoxic activity, and anticancer properties which are possibly due to the principal bioactive phytochemical composites existing in this plant.

Patients and methods:   Between 2014 and 2019, we retrospectively identified 253 consecutive men in the Johns Hopkins AS programme who had mpMRI and PHI followed by a systematic ± targeted biopsy. PHI and PHI density (PHID) were evaluated across Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System version 2.0 (PI-RADSv2) scores and compared to those with and without GR. Next, the negative predictive value (NPV) and area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) were calculated to compare the diagnostic value of PI-RADSv2 score combined with PHI, PHID, or prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD) for GR using their respective first quartile as a cut-off.  Results:   Of the 253 men, 38 men (15%) had GR. Men with GR had higher PHI values (40.7 vs 32.0, P = 0.001), PHID (0.83 vs 0.57, P = 0.007), and PSAD (0.12 vs 0.10, P = 0.037). A PI-RADSv2 ≤3 alone had a NPV of 91.6% for GR (AUC 0.67). Using a PHI cut-off of 25.6 in addition to PI-RADSv2 ≤3, the NPV and AUC were both increased to 98% and 0.70, respectively. Using a PSAD cut-off of 0.07 ng/mL/mL with PI-RADSv2 had an AUC of 0.69 and NPV of 95.4%. PHI and PI-RADSv2 together could have avoided 20% of biopsies at the cost of missing 2.6% of GRs.

To reduce the high impact of RC on erectile function, several sexual-preserving techniques have been proposed. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the oncologic outcomes of patients with iPCa who underwent nerve spring and no-nerve sparing robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC).  Methods:   The clinicopathologic data of male patients who underwent RARC at our institution between 2006 and 2016 were retrospectively analysed. Patients with iPCa at definitive pathological examinations were stratified in two groups, according to the preservation of the neurovascular bundles (nerve sparing vs no nerve sparing). Significant PCa was defined as any Gleason score ≥ 3 + 4. Biochemical recurrence (BR) was defined as a sustained PSA level > 0.2 ng/mL on two or more consecutive appraisals. BR rate was assessed only in patients with incidental prostate cancer and at least 2 years of follow-up. Differences in categorical and continuous variables were analysed using the chi-squared test and the Mann-Withney U test, respectively. Biochemical recurrence curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the Log-rank test.  Results:   Overall, 343 male patients underwent RARC for bladder cancer within the study period. Nerve-sparing surgery was performed in 143 patients (41%), of these 110 had at least 2 years of follow up after surgery. Patients who underwent nerve-sparing surgery were significantly younger (p < 0.001). Clinically significant PCa was found in 24% of patients. No significant differences regarding preoperative PSA value (p = 0.3), PCa pathological stage (p = 0.5), Gleason score (p = 0.3) and positive surgical margin rates (p = 0.3) were found between the two groups. After a median follow-up of 51 months only one patient, in the no-nerve-sparing group had developed a biochemical recurrence (p = 0.4).  Conclusions:   In our series most of the iPca detected in RC specimens can be considered as insignificant with a low rate of BR (0.9%).

Methods:   As part of a larger prospective longitudinal study of patients with suspicion of PCa undergoing prostate biopsy according to clinical practice, a subgroup of patients (n = 401) with PSA 3-10 ng/ml and no prior biopsies was used to evaluate the contribution of TAV to discern non-significant PCa from significant PCa. The cohort was randomly split for training (2/3) and validation (1/3) of the models. High-throughput quantitative fluorescence in-situ hybridization was used to evaluate TAV in peripheral blood mononucleated cells. Models were generated following principal component analysis and random forest and their utility as risk predictors was evaluated by analyzing their predictive capacity and accuracy, summarized by ROC curves, and their clinical benefit with decision curves analysis.  Results:   The median age of the patients was 63 years, with a median PSA of 5 ng/ml and a percentage of PCa diagnosis of 40.6% and significant PCa of 19.2%. Two TAV-based risk models were selected (TAV models 1 and 2) with an AUC ≥ 0.83 in the full study cohort, and AUC > 0.76 in the internal validation cohort.

VSV-IFNβ is oncoselective due to permissive replication in cells with an altered IFN pathway. The human VSV-IFNβ (hIFNβ) vector is currently used in clinical trials as a standalone therapy; however, we hypothesized that oncolytic virotherapy might be more effective when used in combination with radiotherapy (RT). We investigated the synergistic effects of RT and VSV-hIFNβ in the subcutaneous PC3 and orthotopic LNCaP prostate xenograft models and a syngeneic RM9 prostate tumor model. VSV-IFNβ combined with RT amplified tumor killing for PC3 and LNCaP xenografts, and RM9 tumors. This was attributed to the induction of proapoptotic genes leading to increased VSV-IFNβ infection and replication, VSV expression, and oncolysis. In the RM9 tumors, combination therapy resulted in a robust antitumor immune response. Treated RM9 tumor-bearing mice demonstrated an increase in CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell numbers, 100% resistance to tumor rechallenge, and reduced resistance to reimplantation challenge with CD8+ knockdown. RT enhanced the activity of VSV-mediated oncolysis via attenuation of the innate antiviral response, resulting in increased VSV replication and the generation of an adaptive immune response earmarked by an increase in CD8+ lymphocyte numbers and antitumor activity.

Results:   Systemic exposure to abiraterone, prednisone, and prednisolone decreased 14%, 61%, and 42%, respectively, when apalutamide was coadministered with AA-P. No increase in mineralocorticoid excess-related adverse events was observed.

Loss or mutation of HACE1 has been associated with the occurrence of a variety of neoplasms, but the underlying mechanisms have not been defined yet. Here, we report that HACE1 is frequently mutated in human lung cancer. In mice, loss of Hace1 led to enhanced progression of KRasG12D -driven lung tumors. Additional ablation of the oncogenic GTPase Rac1 partially reduced progression of Hace1-/- lung tumors. RAC2, a novel ubiquitylation target of HACE1, could compensate for the absence of its homolog RAC1 in Hace1-deficient, but not in HACE1-sufficient tumors. Accordingly, ablation of both Rac1 and Rac2 fully averted the increased progression of KRasG12D -driven lung tumors in Hace1-/- mice. In patients with lung cancer, increased expression of HACE1 correlated with reduced levels of RAC1 and RAC2 and prolonged survival, whereas elevated expression of RAC1 and RAC2 was associated with poor prognosis. This work defines HACE1 as a crucial regulator of the oncogenic activity of RAC-family GTPases in lung cancer development. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings reveal that mutation of the tumor suppressor HACE1 disrupts its role as a regulator of the oncogenic activity of RAC-family GTPases in human and murine lung cancer.

We aimed to build a nomogram of T-RARP to predict final pathologically proven PC. This study reviewed data of 153 patients that underwent T-RARP for suspected PC performed by the same surgeon.  Patients and methods:   Patients' preoperative demographic and clinical characteristics included age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, PSA density (PSAD), history of acute urinary retention (AUR), abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) of the prostate, and Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) classification at 3-T multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Logistic regression with backward elimination was used to select potential risk factors.  Results:   Based on Harrell's guidelines, we chose seven variables for our final model: Age, DRE corresponding with MRI, AUR, PSAD, prostate-specific antigen velocity (PSAV), PI-RADS, and biopsy pathology. A nomogram for prediction of adenocarcinoma was developed. The original C-index for the nomogram was 0.80 (95% confidence interval=0.74-0.89). The cut-off of the nomogram score for predicting PC was 50 (sensitivity=55.4%; specificity=91.9%). The receiver operating characteristic curve of the model analysis showed an area under the curve of 0.801.  Conclusion:   A nomogram was produced using age, DRE-corresponding MRI, AUR, PSAD, PSAV, PI-RADS, and biopsy pathology. A preoperative nomogram prediction of prostate adenocarcinoma can help the patient and his family understand the possibility of PC and assist them in their decision-making.""","""['Yen Chuan Ou', 'Kuangh-Hsi Chang', 'Min-Che Tung', 'I-Ju Tsai', 'Li-Hua Huang', 'Wei-Chun Weng', 'Chao-Yu Hsu', 'Yi-Sheng Lin', 'Tang-Yi Tsao']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['Developing a nomogram based on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for forecasting high-grade prostate cancer to reduce unnecessary biopsies within the prostate-specific antigen gray zone.', 'Developing a Chinese PI-RADS v2-based nomogram for predicting clinically significant prostate cancer in patients with a prior negative biopsy.', 'An integrated nomogram combining deep learning, Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) scoring, and clinical variables for identification of clinically significant prostate cancer on biparametric MRI: a retrospective multicentre study.', 'Development of a Chinese nomogram based on muti-parametric magnetic resonance for predicting the probability of prostate cancer in patients after initial negative biopsy.', 'Use of the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) for Prostate Cancer Detection with Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Diagnostic Meta-analysis.']"""

Nodal/ALK4 has been associated with vascularization in many cancers. However, the relationship between and role of Nodal/ALK4 and miR-185 in human prostatic cancer is still unknown.  Methods:   Prostatic cancer DU145 cells and LNCaP cells were used to investigate the angiogenic effect induced by Nodal and the anti-angiogenic roles of miR-185. Colony formation assay, MTT assay, transwell assay and tube formation assay were used to explore cell proliferation, migration and tube-forming ability, respectively. A luciferase reporter assay confirmed the binding relationship between miR-185 and ALK4. The expression levels of miR-185, ALK4 and VEGF were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. The effects of miR-185 and Nodal in prostate cancer were also investigated in animal experiments.  Results:   VEGF expression was increased in DU145 cells and LNCaP cells after Nodal incubation, and Nodal activated the proliferation ability of prostatic cancer cells and the migration and tube-forming ability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), which were all inhibited by treatment with the Nodal inhibitor SB431524. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase assay were used to verify miR-185 as a target of ALK4. Prostatic cancer cell proliferation was inhibited by overexpression of miR-185, which was shown to regulate the migration and angiogenesis of HUVECs by targeting ALK4 for suppression. miR-185 also showed a significant inverse correlation with Nodal treatment and reversed the angiogenic effects induced by Nodal. More importantly, for the first time, xenograft experiments indicated that overexpression of miR-185 suppressed tumour development.  Conclusion:   The Nodal/ALK4 pathway is important in the angiogenesis of prostate cancer and can be inhibited by targeting miR-185 to downregulate ALK4.

We sought to develop a fully automated dose-generation framework for IMRT of prostate cancer by entering the patient CT datasets without the contour information into a generative adversarial network (GAN) and to compare its prediction performance to a conventional prediction model trained from patient contours.  Methods:   We propose a synthetic approach to translate patient CT datasets into a dose distribution for IMRT. The framework requires only paired-images, i.e., patient CT images and corresponding RT-doses. The model was trained from 81 IMRT plans of prostate cancer patients, and then produced the dose distribution for 9 test cases. To compare its prediction performance to that of another trained model, we created a model trained from structure images. Dosimetric parameters for the planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OARs) were calculated from the generated and original dose distributions, and mean differences of dosimetric parameters were compared between the CT-based model and the structure-based model.  Results:   The mean differences of all dosimetric parameters except for D98% and D95% for PTV were within approximately 2% and 3% of the prescription dose for OARs in the CT-based model, while the differences in the structure-based model were within approximately 1% for PTV and approximately 2% for OARs, with a mean prediction time of 5 seconds per patient.  Conclusions:   Accurate and rapid dose prediction was achieved by the learning of patient CT datasets by a GAN-based framework. The CT-based dose prediction could reduce the time required for both the iterative optimization process and the structure contouring, allowing physicians and dosimetrists to focus their expertise on more challenging cases.""","""['Yu Murakami', 'Taiki Magome', 'Kazuki Matsumoto', 'Tomoharu Sato', 'Yasuo Yoshioka', 'Masahiko Oguchi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Incorporating dosimetric features into the prediction of 3D VMAT dose distributions using deep convolutional neural network.', 'MRI-based IMRT planning for MR-linac: comparison between CT- and MRI-based plans for pancreatic and prostate cancers.', 'Using deep learning to predict beam-tunable Pareto optimal dose distribution for intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Automated prediction of dosimetric eligibility of patients with prostate cancer undergoing intensity-modulated radiation therapy using a convolutional neural network.', 'Assessment of Monte Carlo algorithm for compliance with RTOG 0915 dosimetric criteria in peripheral lung cancer patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy.', 'Artificial intelligence guided physician directive improves head and neck planning quality and practice Uniformity: A prospective study.', 'Advances in Automated Treatment Planning.', 'CT-Only Radiotherapy: An Exploratory Study for Automatic Dose Prediction on Rectal Cancer Patients Via Deep Adversarial Network.', 'A Survey on Deep Learning for Precision Oncology.', 'An overview of artificial intelligence in oncology.']"""

Our study reveals that SPOP expression is repressed by TGF-β / SMAD signaling axis in PCa CSCs. SPOP promoter contains SMAD-binding elements (SBEs), which can interact with SMAD3. Moreover, TGF-β signaling inhibitor SB431542 promotes the SPOP expression and abrogates PCa stemness.

Fibroblast-like cells are abundant in tumor stroma and they are also responsible for the synthesis of many extracellular matrix components. Fibroblast-cancer cell interplay can modify the functions of both cell types.  Methods:   We applied mass spectrometry and proteomics to unveil the matrisome in 3D spheroids formed by DU145 prostate cancer cells, PC3 prostate cancer cells, or prostate-derived fibroblasts. Similarly, DU145/fibroblast and PC3/fibroblast coculture spheroids were also analyzed. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence were used to confirm the presence of specific proteins in spheroids. Cancer dissemination was studied by utilizing ""out of spheroids"" migration and invasion assays.  Results:   In the spheroid model cancer cell-fibroblast interplay caused remarkable changes in the extracellular matrix and accelerated the invasion of DU145 cells. Fibroblasts produced structural matrix proteins, growth factors, and matrix metalloproteinases. In cancer cell/fibroblast cocultures basement membrane components, including laminins (α3, α5, β2, and β3), heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG2 gene product), and collagen XVIII accumulated in a prominent manner when compared with spheroids that contained fibroblasts or cancer cells only. Furthermore, collagen XVIII was intensively processed to different endostatin-containing isoforms by cancer cell-derived cathepsin L.  Conclusions:   Fibroblasts can promote carcinoma cell dissemination by several different mechanisms. Extracellular matrix and basement membrane proteins provide attachment sites for cell locomotion promoting adhesion receptors. Growth factors and metalloproteinases are known to accelerate cell invasion.

There is a need for the identification of effective anticancer agents. Reptiles such as tortoise, python, and water monitor lizards are exposed to heavy metals, tolerate high levels of radiation, feed on rotten/germ-infested feed, thrive in unsanitary habitat and yet have prolonged lifespans. Such species are rarely reported to develop cancer, suggesting the presence of anticancer molecules/mechanisms.  Methods:   Here, we tested effects from sera of Asian water monitor lizard (Varanus salvator), python (Malayopython reticulatus) and tortoise (Cuora kamaroma amboinensis) against cancer cells. Sera were collected and cytotoxicity assays were performed using prostate cancer cells (PC3), Henrietta Lacks cervical adenocarcinoma cells (HeLa) and human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF7), as well as human keratinized skin cells (Hacat), by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release as an indicator for cell death. Growth inhibition assays were performed to determine the effects on cancer cell proliferation. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry was performed for molecular identification.  Results:   The findings revealed that reptilian sera, but not bovine serum, abolished viability of Hela, PC3 and MCF7 cells. Samples were subjected to liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, which detected 57 molecules from V. salvator, 81 molecules from Malayopython reticulatus and 33 molecules from C. kamaroma amboinensis and putatively identified 9 molecules from V. salvator, 20 molecules from Malayopython reticulatus and 9 molecules from C. kamaroma amboinensis when matched against METLIN database.

The aim of Patient-overview Prostate cancer (PPC) is to register and report these treatments and their effect.Material and methods: In PPC, a new part of the National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden data on start and stop of treatments, imaging, prostate specific antigen, clinical assessment of progression and patient reported outcome measures (PROM) are registered from initiation of hormonal treatment. Data are displayed in a graph to inform clinical decisions for individual patients. For research, data in PPC are linked to PCBaSe with information from NPCR and a number of health care registers.Results: In December 2019, 7 882 men had been registered in PPC out of whom 3 912 had reached the CRPC state. Median time to start of androgen receptor targeted drugs (ART) from start of ADT was 4 years (interquartile range IQR 6) for men with primary ADT, and 9 years (IQR 6) and for men with secondary ADT.

That Is the Question""","""The benefits and drawbacks of the dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI sequence for prostate cancer diagnosis are increasingly being recognized, with many centers adopting the biparametric (bp) MRI approach as the default initial approach. The abandonment of the routine use of contrast medium requires an assessment of the loss of diagnostic power against the gains in operational logistics, costs, time, capacity, and side effects. It is the balance of these factors weighted against the clinical priorities of patients that determines which patient groups can safely avoid dynamic contrast enhancement. Although systematic reviews and individual studies are broadly supportive of the bpMRI approach, the pathway impacts for men with suspected cancer using the bpMRI approach are still not well documented for clinical practice. Robust prospectively acquired data for bpMRI regarding biopsy avoidance, detection of clinically significant and insignificant cancers, and for increasing the precision of tumor grade and volume are needed. There is a requirement for prospective, randomized, or blinded head-to-head, multicenter studies, addressing the noninferiority of biopsy yields prompted by bpMRI and multiparametric MRI approaches. These studies should more precisely define patient groups where the benefits and harms of contrast enhancement are aligned to their clinical priorities.

Objective:   To evaluate third-line LPD outcomes in a real-world cohort of mCRPC patients, identify variables associated with overall survival (OS), and establish a prognostic model.  Design, setting, and participants:   Patients with mCRPC who were progressive on second-line LPD before July 1, 2017 were retrospectively identified from the Dutch Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Registry (CAPRI) and followed until December 31, 2017.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Association of potential risk factors with OS was tested by Cox proportional hazard models after multiple imputation of missing baseline characteristics. A predictive score was computed from the regression coefficient and used to classify patients into risk groups.  Results and limitations:   Of 1011 mCRPC patients progressive on second-line LPD, 602 (60%) received third-line LPD. Patients receiving third-line LPD had a more favorable prognostic profile at baseline and longer median OS than patients with best supportive care (10.4 vs 2.4 mo, p < 0.001).

The statistical analysis was performed to determine the difference in expression based on grade groups and the TNM stage.  Results:   EphrinB2 was expressed in 40 out of 72 cases (55.5 %) of prostate adenocarcinoma and was predominantly negative in the normal prostatic tissue. There was no significant difference in the expression of ephrinB2 in various grade groups (p = 0.7) or stages (p = 0.6).

Here, we investigate the role of E2F5 in PCa in further details. RNAi-mediated E2F5 knockdown and pathway-focused gene expression profiling in PC3 cells identified TFPI2 as a downstream target of E2F5. Manipulation of E2F5 expression was also found to alter MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels as detected by Proteome Profiler array, western blot and reverse transcription coupled quantitative polymerase chain reaction Site-directed mutagenesis, dual-luciferase assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation with anti-E2F5-IgG coupled with qPCR confirmed recruitment of E2F5 on TFPI2, MMP-2 and MMP-9 promoters. RNAi-mediated knockdown of E2F5 expression in PC3 caused a significant alteration of cell migration while that of TFFI2 resulted in a modest change. Abrogation of E2F5 and TFPI2 expression was associated with significant changes in the gelatinolytic activity of active forms of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Moreover, E2F5, MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels were elevated in biopsies of PCa patients relative to that of benign hyperplasia, while TFPI2 expression was reduced. MMP-9 was coimmunoprecipitated with anti-TFPI2-IgG in PCa tissue samples suggesting a direct interaction between the proteins. Finally, artemisinin treatment in PC3 cells repressed E2F5 along with MMP-2/MMP-9 while triggering TFPI2 expression which alleviated PC3 aggressiveness possibly through inhibition of MMP activities. Together, our study reinstates an oncogenic role of E2F5 which operates as a dual-function transcription factor for its targets TFPI2, MMP-2 and MMP-9 and promotes cellular invasiveness.

The new approach incorporates 8 electrodes (in 2 rows) on a biopsy probe (BP) and 12 electrodes on the face of a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) probe and includes a biopsy gun, instrument tracking, 3D-printed needle guide, and EIT hardware and software. The approach was evaluated via simulation, a series of prostate-shaped gel phantoms, and an ex vivo bovine tissue sample using only absolute reconstructions. The simulations surprisingly found that using only biopsy-probe electrode measurements, i.e. omitting TRUS-probe electrode measurements, significantly improves robustness to noise thus leading to simpler modeling and significant decreases in computational times (~13x speed-up/reconstructions in ~27 minutes). The gel phantom experiments resulted in reconstructions with area under the curve (AUC) values extracted from receiver operator characteristic curves of >0.85 for 4 out of the 5 tests, and when incorporating inclusion boundaries resulted in absolute reconstructions yielding 1.9% and 12.2% average percent errors for 3 consistent tests and all 5 tests, respectively.

The ribonucleotide reductase small subunit M2 (RRM2) gene plays an oncogenic role in many cancers. Our previous study elucidated comprehensive molecular mechanisms of RRM2 in prostate cancer (PC). Given the potent functions of RRM2, we set out to determine whether the RRM2 signature can be used to identify aggressive subtypes of PC. We applied gene ontology and pathway analysis in RNA-seq datasets from PC cells overexpressing RRM2. We refined the RRM2 signature by integrating it with two molecular classification systems (PCS and PAM50 subtypes) that define aggressive PC subtypes (PCS1 and luminal B) and correlated signatures with clinical outcomes in six published cohorts comprising 4000 cases of PC. Increased expression of genes in the RRM2 signature was significantly correlated with recurrence, high Gleason score, and lethality of PC. Patients with high RRM2 levels showed higher PCS1 score, suggesting the aggressive PC feature. Consistently, RRM2-regulated genes were highly enriched in the PCS1 signature from multiple PC cohorts. A simplified RRM2 signature (12 genes) was identified by intersecting the RRM2 signature, PCS1 signature, and the PAM50 classifier. Intriguingly, inhibition of RRM2 specifically targets PCS1 and luminal B genes. Furthermore, 11 genes in the RRM2 signature were correlated with enzalutamide resistance by using a single-cell RNA-seq dataset from PC circulating tumor cells. Finally, high expression of RRM2 was associated with an immunosuppressive tumor-immune microenvironment in both primary prostate cancer and metastatic prostate cancer using CIBERSORT analysis and LM22, a validated leukocyte gene signature matrix.

This study examined unmet expectations in prostate cancer patients and their association with decision regret.  Methods:   We conducted a prospective, observational, multi-center study of men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer between 2014 and 2016. Questionnaires were completed at baseline (pre-treatment), and up to 12 months after treatment. Unmet expectations were reported as the proportion of patients who experienced side effects as worse than expected. Linear regression analysis was used to identify factors associated significantly (p ≤ 0.05) with unmet expectations and its association with decision regret.  Results:   At 1-year follow-up, the majority of the patients (71%, 210/296) reported at least one unmet expectation. The proportion of patients who reported worse than expected erectile problems was 56%, recovery period = 29%, urinary problems = 28%, fatigue = 24%, and bowel problems = 17%. Unmet expectations were comparable between treatment groups, except for fatigue. A passive role in the decision-making process (eta squared (η2) = 0.02) and higher scores on the decisional conflict scale (η2 = 0.02) were associated with more unmet expectations, and unmet expectations were associated with decision regret (η2 = 0.08).  Conclusions:   Unmet expectations are common among men treated for localized prostate cancer. Involving patients in the treatment decision-making process and offering additional counseling to patients who indicate uncertainty about their decision, may help to avoid unmet expectations.  Implications for cancer survivors:   The current study emphasizes the need for involving prostate cancer patients in the decision-making process in order to mitigate unmet expectations.""","""['Barbara M Wollersheim', 'Marie-Anne van Stam', 'Ruud J L H Bosch', 'Floris J Pos', 'Corinne N Tillier', 'Henk G van der Poel', 'Neil K Aaronson']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Cancer Surviv""","""['Spirituality is associated with less treatment regret in men with localized prostate cancer.', 'Changes in decisional conflict and decisional regret in patients with localised prostate cancer.', 'Regret and fear in prostate cancer: The relationship between treatment appraisals and fear of recurrence in prostate cancer survivors.', 'Why do patients regret their prostate cancer treatment?

Materials and methods:   Comparison of four groups with 50 patients each, receiving different preparation prior to [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11-PET/CT. Group one, no preparation. Group two, 500 ml sodium chloride administered immediately after tracer injection. Group three, 500 ml sodium chloride and injection of 20 mg furosemide immediately after tracer administration. Group four, 500 ml sodium chloride and injection of 40 mg furosemide immediately after tracer injection. Images were judged visually whether halo artefact was present; semiquantitative measurements were performed with standardised uptake value (SUV).  Results:   Halo artefact of the urinary bladder was present in twelve patients without preparation, in eight patients receiving only sodium chloride, in one patient injected with 20 mg furosemide/sodium chloride and in two patients receiving 40 mg furosemide/sodium chloride, showing a median SUVmean in the bladder of 45.8, 14.4, 4.6 and 5.8, respectively. Differences between patient group without preparation and the two groups with furosemide/sodium chloride were statistically significant. Patient groups receiving 20 mg furosemide and 40 mg furosemide did not differ significantly. Renal halo artefacts were observed in 15 patients of group one, in ten patients of group two, in 14 patients of group three and in 14 patients of group four, with corresponding median SUVmean values of 33.9, 32.0, 37.8 and 30.4 (no statistically significant differences).  Conclusion:   Performing [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11-PET/CT, intravenous injection of 20-mg furosemide and 500-ml sodium chloride significantly reduces the number of bladder halo artefacts and intensity of tracer accumulation in the urinary bladder.

However, PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy can cause undesirable effects due to high accumulation of PSMA radiotracers in salivary glands and kidneys. This study assessed orally administered monosodium glutamate (MSG) as a potential means of reducing kidney and salivary gland radiation exposure using a PSMA-targeting radiotracer. Methods: This prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 10 patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer. Each subject served as his own control. PET/CT imaging sessions using 2-(3-{1-carboxy-5-[(6-18F-fluoro-pyridine-3-carbonyl)-amino]-pentyl}-ureido)-pentanedioic acid (18F-DCFPyL) were performed 3-7 d apart, after oral administration of either 12.7 g of MSG or placebo. Data from the 2 sets of images were analyzed by placing regions of interest on lacrimal, parotid, and submandibular glands; left ventricle; liver; spleen; kidneys; bowel; urinary bladder; gluteus muscle; and malignant lesions. The results from MSG and placebo scans were compared by paired analysis of the region-of-interest data. Results: In total, 142 pathologic lesions along with normal tissues were analyzed. As hypothesized a priori, there was a significant decrease in SUVmax corrected for lean body mass (SULmax) on images obtained after MSG administration in the parotids (24% ± 14%, P = 0.001), submandibular glands (35% ± 11%, P < 0.001), and kidneys (23% ± 26%, P = 0.014). Significant decreases were also observed in the lacrimal glands (49% ± 13%, P < 0.001), liver (15% ± 6%, P < 0.001), spleen (28% ± 13%, P = 0.001), and bowel (44% ± 13%, P < 0.001). A mildly lower blood pool SULmean was observed after MSG administration (decrease of 11% ± 13%, P = 0.021). However, significantly lower radiotracer uptake in terms of SULmean, SULpeak, and SULmax was observed in malignant lesions on scans performed after MSG administration than on the placebo studies (SULmax median decrease, 33%; range, -1% to 75%; P < 0.001). No significant adverse events occurred after placebo or MSG administration, and vital signs were stable. Conclusion: Orally administered MSG significantly decreased salivary gland, kidney, and other normal-organ PSMA radiotracer uptake in human subjects, using 18F-DCFPyL as an exemplar. However, MSG caused a corresponding reduction in tumor uptake, which may limit the benefits of this approach for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.""","""['Sara Harsini', 'Heather Saprunoff', 'Tina Alden', 'Behnoud Mohammadi', 'Don Wilson', 'François Bénard']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Patterns of uptake of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted 18F-DCFPyL in peripheral ganglia.', 'Semiquantitative Parameters in PSMA-Targeted PET Imaging with 18F-DCFPyL: Variability in Normal-Organ Uptake.', 'Prospective Comparison of PET Imaging with PSMA-Targeted 18F-DCFPyL Versus Na18F for Bone Lesion Detection in Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen PET: Clinical Utility in Prostate Cancer, Normal Patterns, Pearls, and Pitfalls.', 'Theranostics for Advanced Prostate Cancer: Current Indications and Future Developments.', 'Predicting the effect of different folate doses on 68GaGa-PSMA-11 organ and tumor uptake using physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling.', 'Characterization of Non-Specific Uptake and Retention Mechanisms of 177LuLu-PSMA-617 in the Salivary Glands.', '225Ac-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy of de novo metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate carcinoma (mHSPC): preliminary clinical findings.', 'Pharmacological Optimization of PSMA-Based Radioligand Therapy.', 'What a difference a methylene makes: replacing Glu with Asp or Aad in the Lys-urea-Glu pharmacophore of PSMA-targeting radioligands to reduce kidney and salivary gland uptake.']"""

However, the development and testing of the 4K panel has been conducted primarily in White men, with limited data in African Americans and no studies in other racial and ethnic groups.  Methods:   We evaluated the 4K panel in a nested case-control study among African American, Latino, Japanese, Native Hawaiian, and White men in the Multiethnic Cohort. Prediagnostic blood levels of free, intact, and total PSA and human kallikrein-related peptidase 2 were measured among 1,667 incident prostate cancer cases and 691 controls with PSA ≥2 ng/mL. We evaluated the discriminative ability of the 4K panel within and across all racial/ethnic groups.  Results:   The 4K panel enhanced discrimination of overall prostate cancer compared with free plus total PSA and total PSA alone (AUC 0.748 vs. 0.711 and 0.669, respectively). Discrimination was further enhanced for Gleason 8+ prostate cancer, aggressive prostate cancer, and death due to prostate cancer, and to a lesser degree for nonaggressive prostate cancer. Improvement of the 4K panel over PSA was observed in each population. Adding a prostate cancer polygenic risk score slightly improved upon the discriminative ability of the 4K panel.  Conclusions:   The superior discriminative ability of the 4K panel over PSA for overall and aggressive prostate cancer across multiethnic populations indicates the broad clinical applicability of the 4K panel.

We previously identified CHD1 as an essential gene in PTEN-deficient cancer cells. Here, we sought definitive in vivo genetic evidence for, and mechanistic understanding of, the essential role of CHD1 in PTEN-deficient prostate cancer. In Pten and Pten/Smad4 genetically engineered mouse models, prostate-specific deletion of Chd1 resulted in markedly delayed tumor progression and prolonged survival. Chd1 deletion was associated with profound tumor microenvironment (TME) remodeling characterized by reduced myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and increased CD8+ T cells. Further analysis identified IL6 as a key transcriptional target of CHD1, which plays a major role in recruitment of immunosuppressive MDSCs. Given the prominent role of MDSCs in suppressing responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), our genetic and tumor biological findings support combined testing of anti-IL6 and ICI therapies, specifically in PTEN-deficient prostate cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate a critical role of CHD1 in MDSC recruitment and discover CHD1/IL6 as a major regulator of the immunosuppressive TME of PTEN-deficient prostate cancer.

However, the incidence and clinical implication of MMR deficiency in sporadic prostate cancers remain poorly understood. We immunohistochemically stained for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 in a set of tissue microarray consisting of 220 radical prostatectomy specimens and evaluated the relationship between loss of their expression and available clinicopathological features. MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 were lost in 2 (0.9%), 6 (2.7%), 37 (16.8%), and 27 (12.3%) prostate cancers, respectively. Loss of at least 1 MMR protein was identified in 50 (22.7%) cases. There were no statistically significant associations between MMR deficiency and patient age, family history of prostate cancer, Gleason score, or pT/pN stage. Nonetheless, the levels of preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were significantly (P = .015) higher in patients with MMR deficiency (mean ± SD: 9.12 ± 9.01 ng/mL) than in those without abnormal MMR (5.76 ± 3.17 ng/mL). There were 15 (6.8%) cases showing loss of at least 2 MMR proteins, which was not significantly associated with PSA level or tumor grade/stage. Additionally, 5 and 2 cases showed losses of at least 3 MMR proteins and all 4 proteins, respectively.

Further analyses of the data on programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression previously stained in the same set of tissue microarray demonstrated associations between loss of ≥2 MMR proteins and a higher rate of PD-L1 expression in cancer cells (17.2% vs 5.2%; P = .033) as well as between cases showing both loss of ≥1 MMR protein(s) and PD-L1 expression in tumor-infiltrating immune cells vs a higher risk of biochemical recurrence (P = .045).

However, together with the increase in the survival rate, a more frequent occurrence of secondary malignancies has been observed as well. TKIs have been demonstrated to be a risk factor of malignancies such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, prostate cancer, and skin cancer. However, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) has never been reported as a secondary malignancy after TKI treatment in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).  Patient concerns:   An 81-year-old male patient diagnosed with CML and treated with TKIs for a long period (15 years) was admitted due to a chief complaint of abdominal pain. A large abdominal mass was detected by imaging that included computed tomography.  Diagnosis:   LPL was confirmed from biopsies after ultrasonography and sigmoidoscopy. Serum IgM level was increased and M protein and monoclonal gammopathy, IgM_kappa light chain type were detected.  Interventions:   The patient received six cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy.  Outcomes:   After chemotherapy, he showed response. The sizes of the abdominal mass and lymph nodes decreased; moreover, serum M protein and IgM levels decreased, as well.  Conclusion:   Herein, for the first time, we describe a patient who developed LPL as a secondary malignancy after administration of TKIs for the treatment of CML.

As patients with cancer face financial challenges, they may be forced to make a trade-off between food and medical care. We characterized food insecurity and its relationship to treatment adherence in a population-based sample of cancer survivors.  Methods:   Individuals 21 to 64 years old, diagnosed between 2008 and 2016 with stage I-III breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer were identified from the New Mexico Tumor Registry and invited to complete a survey, recalling their financial experience in the year before and the year after cancer diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95%CIs.  Results:   Among 394 cancer survivors, 229 (58%) were food secure in both the year before and the year after cancer diagnosis (persistently food secure), 38 (10%) were food secure in the year before and food insecure in the year after diagnosis (newly food insecure), and 101 (26%) were food insecure at both times (persistently food insecure). Newly food-insecure (OR, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.02 to 7.79) and persistently food-insecure (OR, 3.04; 95% CI,1.36 to 6.77) cancer survivors were considerably more likely to forgo, delay, or make changes to prescription medication than persistently food-secure survivors. In addition, compared with persistently food-secure cancer survivors, newly food-insecure (OR, 9.23; 95% CI, 2.90 to 29.3), and persistently food-insecure (OR, 9.93; 95% CI, 3.53 to 27.9) cancer survivors were substantially more likely to forgo, delay, or make changes to treatment other than prescription medication.

Recently developed albumin-binding PSMA radioligands showed a remarkably increased tumor uptake because of the enhanced blood circulation, but higher accumulation of activity was also observed in off-target organs and tissues. The aim of this study was to investigate the option of using fast-cleared, small-molecular-weight PSMA inhibitors (PSMA-11, 2-PMPA, and ZJ-43) to reduce the kidney uptake of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-ALB-56, a previously developed albumin-binding PSMA radioligand. Dual-isotope SPECT/CT imaging was performed with tumor-bearing mice coinjected with [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-ALB-56 and a 2.5-fold molar excess of [67Ga]Ga-PSMA-11. At early timepoints after injection, the high renal uptake of [67Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 reduced the accumulation of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-ALB-56 in the kidneys substantially, whereas the tumor uptake of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-ALB-56 was only slightly affected. These findings were confirmed in biodistribution studies, which revealed reduced uptake of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-ALB-56 in the kidneys due to coadministered unlabeled PSMA-11 (9.1 ± 0.8% IA/g vs 46 ± 11% IA/g; 1 h p.i.). The tumor uptake of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-ALB-56 was almost the same at 1 h p.i., irrespective of whether or not PSMA-11 was coinjected (24 ± 6% IA/g vs 27 ± 7% IA/g). The application of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-ALB-56 with 2-PMPA or ZJ-43, respectively, showed similar results in biodistribution studies. Among all three tested PSMA inhibitors, 2-PMPA, applied at a 2.5-fold molar excess relative to [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-ALB-56, was most effective to improve the tumor-to-kidney ratios over the first hours after injection of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-ALB-56.

Transperineal ultrasound (TPUS) is a non-invasive imaging modality that can improve delineation of prostate volumes. We performed a pilot analysis to assess for differences in anatomical position between conventional CT and a TPUS delineated prostate apex and determined whether these translated into a clinically significant difference in apical point dose.  Methods:   A 2D 5 MHz TPUS autoscan image guidance system was utilised during definitive intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for prostate cancer. Distances were measured from a fixed reference point to prostate apex on both US and CT in the mid-sagittal plane. Differences between groups were assessed using the Wilcoxon sign rank test with a two-tailed significance of α = 0.05.  Results:   Fifty-nine consecutive patients were independently assessed. There was strong evidence of a difference between CT and TPUS delineated apex position (P = 0.0075). Median apex position was 3.6 mm caudal on TPUS vs. CT imaging (95% CI: 2.5-4.8 mm). There was strong evidence of a difference in point dose between CT and TPUS delineated apex (P = 0.0029). Median point dose at the TPUS contoured apex was 1.9 Gy lower than CT (95% CI: 0.7-3.1 Gy) corresponding to 98% of prescribed dose.  Conclusions:   This study demonstrates a difference in anatomical delineation of prostate apex position between CT imaging compared to TPUS, corresponding to a statistically significant difference in apex point dose.

Interestingly, our findings showed that the expression levels of PLCε were positively associated with those of HIF-1α in clinical prostate carcinoma samples. Knockdown of PLCε impaired HIF-1α levels and transcriptional activity by regulating the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase pathway, and blocking HIF-1α nuclear translocation. Furthermore, PLCε could interact with the von Hippel-Lindau E3 ligase complex to modulate the stability of HIF-1α.

Therefore, WARMTH decided to plan a multicenter retrospective analysis (the ""617 trial"") to evaluate response rate and OS as well as the impact of prior therapies on OS in more than 300 patients treated with 177Lu-PSMA-617.  Materials and methods:   The data of 631 metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) patients from 11 different clinics were evaluated. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, all patients had to have received at least abiraterone or enzalutamide prior to [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 therapy. The patients were divided into three groups: patients who had received prior chemotherapy, patients who avoided chemotherapy, and patients for whom a chemotherapy was contraindicated.  Results:   The analysis included the data of 416 patients, with a median age of 71.9 years. At the time of analysis, 87 patients (20,9%) were still alive. A total of 53.6% of patients had received both abiraterone and enzalutamide; 75.5% and 26.4% had a history of chemotherapy with docetaxel and cabazitaxel, respectively. A total of 20.4% had had Ra-223. The median OS was 11.1 months. Prior chemotherapy, the existence of bone and liver metastases, as well as Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status, were significant prognosticators of worse overall survival in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients without any prior chemotherapy showed a significantly longer OS (14.6 months). The median OS in patients who received one or two lines of chemotherapy with docetaxel or docetaxel followed by cabazitaxel, respectively, was 10.9 months and 8.9 months. There was no difference in OS between patients who had not received chemotherapy and patients for whom chemotherapy was contraindicated. The other prior therapies did not have any significant impact on OS.  Conclusion:   In the present multicenter analysis, chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC patients receiving [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 therapy had a significantly longer OS than patients with a history of chemotherapy.

In an initial tumour efficacy study, mice bearing DU-145 tumours were administered intravenously with 6 MBq [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-Miltuximab® or control DOTA-Miltuximab® then euthanised after 27 days. In a subsequent survival efficacy study, tumour-bearing mice were given 3 or 10 MBq of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-Miltuximab®, or control, and followed up to 120 days.

Antibody accumulation was higher (% IA/g) in tumours than other organs across multiple time points. A single injection with 6 MBq of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-Miltuximab® significantly inhibited tumour growth as compared with DOTA-Miltuximab® (control).

Six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 1 (STEAP1) expression is correlated with the occurrence and progression of multiple cancers. Here, we assessed STEAP1 expression in ovarian cancer and explored the relationship between STEAP1 and ovarian cancer progression. We used immunohistochemistry and public databases to test STEAP1 expression in normal human ovarian tissues, benign ovarian tumours, and ovarian cancer. The expression of STEAP1 and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes was analysed using immunocytochemistry, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and western blotting in ovarian cancer cell lines. Lentivirus was used to knockdown and overexpress STEAP1. Invasion, migration, growth, clonogenicity, and apoptosis were assessed using transwell assay, growth curve, plate clone formation assay, and flow cytometry. We used a tumour xenograft to verify the relationship between STEAP1 and in vivo ovarian cancer cell growth. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) activities were examined using Matrix metalloproteinase zymography assay. STEAP1 was highly expressed in the human ovarian cancer tissues and a highly invasive ovarian cancer cell line. Overexpression of STEAP1 was related to poor prognosis in ovarian cancer patients.

We sought to assess the impact of EPI on the decision to biopsy in a real-world clinical setting.  Methods:   We conducted a prospective, randomized, blinded, two-armed clinical utility study that enrolled 1094 patients with 72 urologists from 24 urology practices. Patients were considered for prostate biopsy at enrollment based on standard clinical criteria. All patients had an EPI test; however, patients were randomized into EPI vs. control arms where only the EPI arm received results for their biopsy decision.  Results:   In the EPI arm (N = 458), 93 patients received negative EPI scores of which 63% were recommended to defer biopsy by the urologist and 74% ultimately deferred. In contrast, 87% of patients with positive EPI scores were recommended to undergo biopsy with a 72% compliance rate to the urologist's recommendation. This led to detection of 30% more HGPC compared to the control arm, and we estimate that 49% fewer HGPC were missed due to deferrals compared to standard of care (SOC). Overall, 68% of urologists reported that the EPI test influenced their biopsy decision. The primary reason not to comply with EPI results was rising PSA.  Conclusion:   To our knowledge this is the first report on a PC biomarker utility study with a blinded control arm. The study demonstrates that the EPI test influences the overall decision to defer or proceed with a biopsy and improves patient stratification.""","""['Ronald Tutrone', 'Michael J Donovan', 'Phillipp Torkler', 'Vasisht Tadigotla', 'Tom McLain', 'Mikkel Noerholm', 'Johan Skog', 'James McKiernan']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['ExoDx prostate test as a predictor of outcomes of high-grade prostate cancer - an interim analysis.', 'A Prospective Adaptive Utility Trial to Validate Performance of a Novel Urine Exosome Gene Expression Assay to Predict High-grade Prostate Cancer in Patients with Prostate-specific Antigen 2-10ng/ml at Initial Biopsy.', 'Predicting high-grade prostate cancer at initial biopsy: clinical performance of the ExoDx (EPI) Prostate Intelliscore test in three independent prospective studies.', 'PSA and blood test diagnostics of prostate cancer.', 'Risk calculators and updated tools to select and plan a repeat biopsy for prostate cancer detection.', 'Network approach in liquidomics landscape.', 'Cancer Associated Macrophage-like Cells Are Prognostic for Highly Aggressive Prostate Cancer in Both the Non-Metastatic and Metastatic Settings.', 'Recent Advances in Blood-Based Liquid Biopsy Approaches in Prostate Cancer.', 'ExoDx prostate test as a predictor of outcomes of high-grade prostate cancer - an interim analysis.', 'Migrasomes, a new mode of intercellular communication.']"""

Interdisciplinary treatment teams therefore often face the challenge of balancing the benefits of early kidney transplantation and the risk of metastatic progression. Hence, we compared the quality-adjusted life expectancy of different management strategies in kidney failure patients diagnosed with active surveillance-eligible prostate cancer during pretransplantation workup.  Design, setting, participants, & measurements:   A discrete event simulation model was developed on the basis of a systematic literature search, clinical guidelines, and expert opinion. After model validation and calibration, we simulated four management strategies in a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 patients: Definitive treatment (surgery or radiation therapy) and listing after a waiting period of 2 years, definitive treatment and immediate listing, active surveillance and listing after a waiting period of 2 years, and active surveillance and immediate listing. Individual patient results (quality-adjusted life years; QALYs) were aggregated into strategy-specific means (± SEs).  Results:   Active surveillance and immediate listing yielded the highest amount of quality-adjusted life expectancy (6.97 ± 0.01 QALYs) followed by definitive treatment and immediate listing (6.75 ± 0.01 QALYs). These two strategies involving immediate listing not only outperformed those incorporating a waiting period of 2 years (definitive treatment: 6.32 ± 0.01 QALYs; active surveillance: 6.59 ± 0.01 QALYs) but also yielded a higher proportion of successfully performed transplantations (72% and 74% versus 56% and 59%), with less time on hemodialysis on average (4.02 and 3.81 years versus 4.80 and 4.65 years).

The ability to identify primary tumors capable of dissemination is an unmet need in the quest to understand lethal biology and improve patient outcomes. Previous studies have linked chromosomal instability (CIN), which generates aneuploidy following chromosomal missegregation during mitosis, to PC progression. Evidence of CIN includes broad copy number alterations (CNAs) spanning > 300 base pairs of DNA, which may also be measured via RNA expression signatures associated with CNA frequency. Signatures of CIN in metastatic PC, however, have not been interrogated or well defined. We examined a published 70-gene CIN signature (CIN70) in untreated and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and previously published reports. We also performed transcriptome and CNA analysis in a unique cohort of untreated primary tumors collected from diagnostic prostate needle biopsies (PNBX) of localized (M0) and metastatic (M1) cases to determine if CIN was linked to clinical stage and outcome.  Methods:   PNBX were collected from 99 patients treated in the VA Greater Los Angeles (GLA-VA) Healthcare System between 2000 and 2016. Total RNA was extracted from high-grade cancer areas in PNBX cores, followed by RNA sequencing and/or copy number analysis using OncoScan. Multivariate logistic regression analyses permitted calculation of odds ratios for CIN status (high versus low) in an expanded GLA-VA PNBX cohort (n = 121).  Results:   The CIN70 signature was significantly enriched in primary tumors and CRPC metastases from M1 PC cases. An intersection of gene signatures comprised of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) generated through comparison of M1 versus M0 PNBX and primary CRPC tumors versus metastases revealed a 157-gene ""metastasis"" signature that was further distilled to 7-genes (PC-CIN) regulating centrosomes, chromosomal segregation, and mitotic spindle assembly. High PC-CIN scores correlated with CRPC, PC-death and all-cause mortality in the expanded GLA-VA PNBX cohort. Interestingly, approximately 1/3 of M1 PNBX cases exhibited low CIN, illuminating differential pathways of lethal PC progression.  Conclusions:   Measuring CIN in PNBX by transcriptome profiling is feasible, and the PC-CIN signature may identify patients with a high risk of lethal progression at the time of diagnosis.""","""['Eric T Miller', 'Sungyong You', 'Radu M Cadaneanu', 'Minhyung Kim', 'Junhee Yoon', 'Sandy T Liu', 'Xinmin Li', 'Lorna Kwan', 'Jennelle Hodge', 'Michael J Quist', 'Catherine S Grasso', 'Michael S Lewis', 'Beatrice S Knudsen', 'Michael R Freeman', 'Isla P Garraway']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['A novel DNA methylation signature is associated with androgen receptor activity and patient prognosis in bone metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Ribonucleotide reductase small subunit M2 is a master driver of aggressive prostate cancer.', 'Amplification of MUC1 in prostate cancer metastasis and CRPC development.', 'Chromosomal instability and aneuploidy as causes of cancer drug resistance.', 'The potential of microRNAs as human prostate cancer biomarkers: A meta-analysis of related studies.', 'Mechanisms of chromosomal instability (CIN) tolerance in aggressive tumors: surviving the genomic chaos.', 'Chronic hypoxia favours adoption to a castration-resistant cell state in prostate cancer.', 'Harnessing transcriptionally driven chromosomal instability adaptation to target therapy-refractory lethal prostate cancer.', 'Systematic Elucidation of the Aneuploidy Landscape and Identification of Aneuploidy Driver Genes in Prostate Cancer.', 'Identification of DNA Damage Repair-Associated Prognostic Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer Using Transcriptomic Data Analysis.']"""

Although the metabolic understanding of this disease has increased in recent years, the analysis of such alterations through noninvasive methodologies in biofluids remains limited. Here, we used NMR-based metabolomics on a large cohort of urine samples (more than 650) from PC and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) patients to investigate the molecular basis of this disease. Multivariate analysis failed to distinguish between the two classes, highlighting the modest impact of prostate alterations on urine composition and the multifactorial nature of PC. However, univariate analysis of urine metabolites unveiled significant changes, discriminating PC from BPH. Metabolites with altered abundance in urine from PC patients revealed changes in pathways related to cancer biology, including glycolysis and the urea cycle.

Here, peptides that target pancreatic cancer cells were selected using phage display technology using a 15-mer fUSE5 library. Phage were pre-cleared against immortalized pancreatic cells (hTERT-HPNE), followed by selections against pancreatic cancer (Mia Paca-2) cells. Next-generation sequencing identified two peptides, MCA1 and MCA2, with a Log2 fold change (Mia Paca-2/ hTERT-HPNE) >1.5. Modified ELISA and fluorescent microscopy showed that both peptides bound significantly higher to Mia Paca-2 cells, and not to hTERT-HPNE, embryonic kidney (HEK 293), ovarian (SKOV-3) and prostate cancer (LNCaP) cell lines. Further characterization of MCA1 and MCA2 revealed EC50 values of 16.11 µM (95% CI [9.69, 26.31 µM]) and 97.01 µM (95% CI [58.64, 166.30 µM]), respectively. Based on these results, MCA1 was selected for further studies. A competitive dose response assay demonstrated specific binding and an IC50 value of 2.15 µM (95% CI [1.28, 3.62 µM]).

This implies there is scope for improvement with these campaigns and a large increase in macular degeneration activity following a public meeting, and report release suggests that increased funding may increase impact.

Materials and methods:   We included 358 patients undergoing planned same day discharge for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy at 6 French centers. Primary outcomes were same day discharge failure, and 30-day complication and readmission rates. Secondary outcomes included preoperative characteristics, perioperative parameters, Chung score and pain visual analogue scale at discharge, pathological features and followup.  Results:   Mean patient age was 64.7 years. Mean operative time and blood loss were 147.5 minutes and 228 ml, respectively. Concomitant lymph node dissection and nerve sparing procedures were performed in 43% and 62% of cases, respectively. No patient required transfusion or conversion. The same day discharge failure, complication and readmission rates were 4.2%, 16.8% and 2.8%, respectively. The most frequent complications were low grade complications including urinary infection (6.4%) and ileus (2.8%). Blood loss, lymph node dissection and pain visual analogue scale were significantly correlated with same day discharge failure. Same day discharge failure was reported in 7.8% of patients with pelvic lymph node dissection compared with only 1.5% of patients who did not undergo lymph node dissection (p=0.003). ASA® score was the only factor significantly associated with postoperative complications (p=0.023). The only factor correlated with readmission was the pain visual analogue scale at discharge (p=0.017).  Conclusions:   This first multi-institutional evaluation confirms the safety of same day discharge robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in a single health care system and identifies for the first time factors associated with same day discharge failure and readmission.

We assessed the impact of brachytherapy following surgery for local tumor control, and report surgical techniques and outcomes.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the records of all children who underwent surgery for bladder/prostate rhabdomyosarcoma, including tumor relapse, at our institution from 2009 onward.  Results:   A total of 38 patients with a median age of 29 months (range 10 to 134) met inclusion criteria. Five-year overall survival was 92.8% (95% CI 72.9 to 98.1), and event-free survival at a median followup of 12 months (range 3 to 111) was 73.7% (95% CI 53.4 to 86.2). Three treatment groups were defined, ie bladder preserving surgery combined with brachytherapy, bladder preserving surgery alone and cystectomy. Five-year event-free survival rates for the 3 groups were 85.6% (95% CI 61.2 to 95.2), 66.7% (95% CI 27.2 to 88.2) and 50% (95% CI 5.8 to 84.5), respectively. Bladder preserving surgery was performed in 33 patients (87%), of whom 23 (70%) also underwent brachytherapy, while cystectomy was performed in 5 (13%). Reconstructive procedures varied depending on tumor location and spread.  Conclusions:   Combining brachytherapy with surgery results in a high bladder preservation rate and improves event-free survival compared to surgery alone in children with bladder/prostate rhabdomyosarcoma. The combination is also effective in treating local tumor relapse, and is associated with less extensive reconstructive procedures due to exclusion of tumors of unfavorable size and location for brachytherapy.""","""['Andreas Schmidt', 'Steven W Warmann', 'Franziska Eckert', 'Verena Ellerkamp', 'Juergen Schaefer', 'Gunnar Blumenstock', 'Frank Paulsen', 'Joerg Fuchs']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Editorial Comment.', 'Brachytherapy Combined With Surgery for Conservative Treatment of Children With Bladder Neck and/or Prostate Rhabdomyosarcoma.', 'Conservative surgery plus brachytherapy treatment for boys with prostate and/or bladder neck rhabdomyosarcoma: a single team experience.', 'Pulsed-dose rate brachytherapy for pediatric bladder prostate rhabdomyosarcoma: Compliance and early clinical results.', 'Current treatment of pediatric bladder and prostate rhabdomyosarcoma (bladder preserving vs. radical cystectomy).', 'The role of surgery in the management of pediatric pelvic rhabdomyosarcoma.', 'Increasing Patient Safety and Treatment Quality by Using Intraoperative MRI for Organ-Preserving Tumor Resection and High-Dose Rate Brachytherapy in Children with Bladder/Prostate and Perianal Rhabdomyosarcoma.', 'Developments in the Surgical Approach to Staging and Resection of Rhabdomyosarcoma.', 'Detailed functional results after bladder-preserving surgery and high-dose-rate brachytherapy in pediatric bladder/prostate rhabdomyosarcoma.', 'GEIS-SEHOP clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma.']"""

Metastatic STS contribute significantly to disease-related mortality in this age group; however, data are limited due to under-representation in clinical trials. Methods: AYAs aged 18-39 years, diagnosed with metastatic STS between 1990 and 2012, were identified from The Royal Marsden Hospital database. Outcomes of interest were clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, overall survival (OS), and prognostic factors. Results: Overall, 455 patients were included. Median age at diagnosis of metastatic STS was 33 years (interquartile range [IQR] 27-37 years). The most common histological subtypes were leiomyosarcoma (n = 68, 15%), synovial sarcoma (n = 68, 15%), Ewing sarcoma (n = 44, 10%), and rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 35, 8%). Treatments included systemic therapy (n = 395, 87%; median 2 lines [IQR 1-3]; clinical trial n = 93, 22%), radiotherapy (n = 297, 66%), and metastasectomy (n = 191, 43%). Median duration between last chemotherapy regimen and death was 4.6 months (IQR 2-10). Median OS was 19.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 15.8-22.2); 5-year OS was 16%. Of common subtypes, patients with rhabdomyosarcoma had the worst OS (8.8 months; 95% CI 7.9-11.4). Adverse prognostic factors included male gender, synchronous metastases, bone or liver metastases, first-line polychemotherapy, and no metastasectomy.

Furthermore, attempt was also made to compare radiation absorbed doses for normal organs and tumor lesions in subsequent cycles of 177Lu-PSMA-617 peptide receptor radioligand therapy (PRLT) in the same group of patients during the course of treatment. Methods: A total of 30 patients of proven mCRPC were enrolled for this prospective study. These patients received up to 5 cycles of treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617 PRLT (1 cycle for 13 patients, 2 cycles for 9 patients, 3 cycles for 3 patients, and 5 cycles for 5 patients), at 11-12-week intervals between the two successive therapies. The patients underwent postadministration whole-body scintigraphy at five time points: 0.5 (prevoid), 2, 12, 24, and 72/96 h (postvoid). From time-activity curves generated by drawing regions of interests on the images, number of disintegrations was determined. Tumor masses were estimated from pretherapeutic 68Ga-PSMA-11 positron emission tomography-computed tomography images. Absorbed doses for organs and tumors were calculated using OLINDA 2.0 software. Results: The average activity of 177Lu-PSMA-617 (mean ± SD) administered per patient per cycle was 4.94 ± 0.45 GBq. The mean absorbed organ doses (mean ± SD) from first therapy cycle in Gy/GBq were as follows: kidneys 0.52 ± 0.16, spleen 0.17 ± 0.07, liver 0.08 ± 0.05, salivary glands 0.53 ± 0.30, lacrimal glands 1.45 ± 0.85, nasal mucosa membrane 0.46 ± 0.19, urinary bladder 0.23 ± 0.02, and bone marrow 0.04 ± 0.03. The mean effective dose for whole body from first therapy cycle was 0.05 ± 0.03 Sv/GBq. Among all the normal organs, lacrimal glands received the highest absorbed dose. The median dose for all lesions, bone lesions, lymph nodes, primary site, liver lesion, lung lesion, and soft tissue deposit from first therapy cycle was determined to be 4.17, 4.23, 3.96, 4.36, 10.27, 0.78, and 4.68 Gy/GBq respectively. Absorbed doses received by the normal organs in five consecutive cycles follow three different trends, (a) for kidneys, salivary glands, and nasal mucous membrane, absorbed doses increased from first therapy cycle to second therapy cycle and then slowly decreased in subsequently therapy cycles; (b) for spleen, liver, and lacrimal glands, absorbed doses decreased with the successive therapy cycles; and (c) in case of bone marrow, bladder, and whole body, mean absorbed dose almost remained constant in each therapy cycle. Absorbed doses to the lesions gradually decreased with increase of the number of therapy cycles. Conclusions: The organ and tumor absorbed doses of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in mCRPC patients were found to be comparable to the data reported in the literature. The highest absorbed organ dose was observed in lacrimal glands and being a dose limiting organ, a cumulative activity up to 32.5 GBq (878 mCi) of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in 4-5 therapy cycles appears safe and feasible to achieve full therapeutic window.""","""['Kamaldeep', 'Gaurav Wanage', 'Sudeep Kumar Sahu', 'Pravind Maletha', 'Aadil Adnan', 'Sonam Suman', 'Sandip Basu', 'Tapas Das', 'Sharmila Banerjee']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Biother Radiopharm""","""['Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Radioligand Therapy Using 177Lu-PSMA I&T and 177Lu-PSMA-617 in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Comparison of Safety, Biodistribution, and Dosimetry.', 'Radiation Dosimetry for 177Lu-PSMA I&T in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Absorbed Dose in Normal Organs and Tumor Lesions.', 'Estimation of Absorbed Doses of Indigenously Produced ""Direct-route"" Lutetium-177-177LuLu-DOTA-TATE PRRT in Normal Organs and Tumor Lesions in Patients of Metastatic Neuroendocrine Tumors: Comparison with No-Carrier-Added 177LuLu-DOTA-TATE and the Trend with Multiple Cycles.', 'Hematologic toxicity profile and efficacy of 225AcAc-PSMA-617 α-radioligand therapy of patients with extensive skeletal metastases of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Radiation Dosimetry in 177Lu-PSMA-617 Therapy.', 'Joint EANM/SNMMI procedure guideline for the use of 177Lu-labeled PSMA-targeted radioligand-therapy (177Lu-PSMA-RLT).', 'PSMA theragnostics for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Kidney Protection with the Radical Scavenger α1-Microglobulin (A1M) during Peptide Receptor Radionuclide and Radioligand Therapy.']"""

Methods: The cell viability was determined by the MTT assay. Morphological changes are detected by light microscopy. The ELISA assay is used to evaluate the nuclear DNA fragmentation and western Blot to detect the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins including poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Results: The three tested extracts exhibited a dose-response cytotoxic effect and antiproliferative action on DU145 cell line and induce morphological changes. The dose of each extract required to inhibit cell proliferation by 50% (IC50) was 0.12, 0.36, and 0.42 mg/mL, respectively, for seeds oil, juice, and peel. The three extracts could also induce prostate cancer cell apoptosis by an increase of DNA fragmentation, PARP cleavage, and inhibition of the COX-2 expression.

Methods:   Twenty-eight consecutive mCRPC patients with liver metastases given 177Lu-PSMA-617 RLT were analyzed retrospectively. Their planned regimen was 4-6 cycles at 6 ± 2-week intervals; the mean activity/cycle was 6.5 ± 0.5 GBq. Hepatic response was determined by modified positron emission tomography response criteria in solid tumors; association of such response with overall survival (OS) was tested, as were relationships of the selected patient, disease, and treatment characteristics with hepatic progression-free survival (PFShep) and OS. Survival analyses used Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank test at p < 0.05 significance, and Cox proportional-hazards modeling.  Results:   Median (minimum-maximum) follow-up was 37.5 (2.3-50.6) months. In liver metastases, complete or partial response was observed in 6 patients (21%) each, and stable disease in 1 (4%), for hepatic disease control in 46%. Overall, median (95% confidence interval) PFShep was 5.7 (2.2-9.2) months, and OS, 11.7 (3.0-20.4) months. Patients with hepatic disease control did not reach the median OS, while those with hepatic progressive disease had median OS (95% confidence interval) of 6.4 (1.6-11.1) months. In multivariate analysis, hepatic disease control by 177Lu-PSMA-617 RLT was significantly independently associated with OS, as was a prostate-specific antigen decline of ≥ 50% after 2 RLT cycles, and good baseline performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0-1).

Peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor γ coactivator‑1α (PGC‑1α) is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial function and is highly expressed in prostate cancer PC3 and DU145 cells with p53 deletion or mutation. However, whether p53 negatively regulates PGC‑1α in prostate cancer cells remains to be elucidated. In the present study, p53 overexpression was induced in prostate cancer PC3 cells. Subsequently, the expression levels of PGC‑1α and alterations to mitochondrial function were assessed. Moreover, PGC‑1α was activated in prostate cancer PC3 cells using ZLN005 to investigate alterations to mitochondrial function and cell apoptosis. The present study revealed that p53 decreased the expression and nuclear localization of the PGC‑1α protein and induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Activation of PGC‑1α partially reversed p53‑mediated mitochondrial dysfunction. Inhibition of the p53/PGC‑1α pathway on mitochondrial biogenesis and fission‑/fusion‑associated gene and protein expression were associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. p53/PGC‑1α‑mediated mitochondrial dysfunction promoted apoptosis of PC3 prostate cancer cells.

We assessed the long-term oncologic outcomes of clinically localized prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy in Korean men.  Materials and methods:   We analyzed 786 clinically localized prostate cancer patients who underwent radical prostatectomy, from June 1993 to June 2008. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis and log-rank test were used to assess the oncologic outcomes.  Results:   The mean age of the patients was 64.9±6.6 years. Pelvic lymph node dissection was performed in 373 patients. Pathologic T and N stage cancer with local advancement and invasion were detected by radical prostatectomy in 307 and 22 patients, respectively. In total, 38 patients who underwent adjuvant therapy were excluded from the analysis of progression after biochemical recurrence (BCR), which occurred in 261 men. In total, 219 patients underwent salvage treatment. Local recurrence and distant metastasis occurred in 109 and 42 patients, respectively; 36 patients experienced metastasis with local recurrence. Castration-resistant prostate cancer developed in 22 patients, and overall and disease-specific mortality was noted in 148 and 23 patients, respectively. The median duration from operation to BCR, BCR to metastasis, and metastasis to disease-specific death was 25, 40, and 22 months, respectively.  Conclusions:   We demonstrated the long-term prognosis of localized prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy among Koreans.

The role of PNUTS overexpression has hardly been studied in cancer. In this study, we used immunohistochemistry to quantitate PNUTS expression on a tissue microarray containing 17,747 clinical prostate cancer specimens. As compared to normal prostate epithelium, PNUTS expression was often higher in cancer. Among 12,235 interpretable tumors, PNUTS staining was negative in 21%, weak in 34%, moderate in 35%, and strong in 10% of cases. High PNUTS expression was associated with higher tumor stage, classical and quantitative Gleason grade, nodal stage, surgical margin, Ki67 labeling index, and early biochemical recurrence (p < 0.0001 each). PNUTS expression proved to be a moderate prognostic parameter with a maximal univariable Cox proportional hazard for PSA recurrence-free survival of 2.21 compared with 5.91 for Gleason grading. It was independent from established prognostic parameters in multivariable analysis. Comparison with molecular data available from earlier studies using the same TMA identified associations between high PNUTS expression and elevated androgen receptor expression (p < 0.0001), presence of TMPRSS2:ERG fusion (p < 0.0001), and 8 of 11 chromosomal deletions (3p13, 5q21, 8p21, 10q23, 12p13, 13q14, 16q24, and 17p13; p < 0.05 each). Particularly strong associations with PTEN and 12p13 deletions (p < 0.0001 each) may indicate a functional relationship, which has already been established for PNUTS and PTEN. PNUTS had no additional role on outcome in PTEN-deleted cancers. In conclusion, the results of our study identify high PNUTS protein levels as a predictor of poor prognosis possibly linked to increased levels of genomic instability.

These electroporation-based genetically engineered mouse models (EPO-GEMM) recapitulate features of traditional germline models and, by modeling genetic factors linked to late-stage human disease, can produce tumors that are metastatic and castration-resistant. A subset of tumors with Trp53 alterations acquired spontaneous WNT pathway alterations, which are also associated with metastatic prostate cancer in humans. Using the EPO-GEMM approach and an orthogonal organoid-based model, we show that WNT pathway activation drives metastatic disease that is sensitive to pharmacologic WNT pathway inhibition. Thus, by leveraging EPO-GEMMs, we reveal a functional role for WNT signaling in driving prostate cancer metastasis and validate the WNT pathway as therapeutic target in metastatic prostate cancer.

We have previously reported clinical trials combining CTLA-4 blockade with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in metastatic melanoma patients and in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients. Here, we investigate the effect that cancer type has on circulating T cells in metastatic melanoma and mCRPC patients, treated with ipilimumab and GM-CSF.  Methods:   We used next-generation sequencing of T-cell receptors (TCR) to compare the circulating T cells of melanoma and mCRPC patients receiving the same treatment with ipilimumab and GM-CSF by Wilcoxon rank sum test. Flow cytometry was utilized to investigate specific T-cell populations. TCR sequencing results were correlated with each T-cell subpopulation by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Of note, 14 metastatic melanoma patients had samples available for TCR sequencing and 21 had samples available for flow cytometry analysis; 37 mCRPC patients had samples available for sequencing of whom 22 have TCR data available at both timepoints; 20 of these patients had samples available for flow cytometry analysis and 16 had data available at both timepoints.  Results:   While melanoma and mCRPC patients had similar pretreatment circulating T-cell counts, treatment induces greater expansion of circulating T cells in melanoma patients. Metastatic melanoma patients have a higher proportion of clones that increased more than fourfold after the treatment compared with mCRPC patients (18.9% vs 11.0%, p=0.017). Additionally, melanoma patients compared with mCRPC patients had a higher ratio of convergent frequency (1.22 vs 0.60, p=0.012). Decreases in clonality induced by treatment are associated with baseline CD8+ T-cell counts in both patient groups, but are more pronounced in the melanoma patients (r=-0.81, p<0.001 vs r=-0.59, p=0.02).

Post-transcriptional modifications and nuclear translocation of YAP1 are crucial for its nuclear activity. The objective of this study was to elucidate the mechanism by which the steroid hormone androgen regulates YAP1 nuclear entry and functions in several human prostate cancer cell lines. We demonstrate that androgen exposure suppresses the inactivating post-translational modification phospho-Ser-127 in YAP1, coinciding with increased YAP1 nuclear accumulation and activity. Pharmacological and genetic experiments revealed that intact androgen receptor signaling is necessary for androgen's inactivating effect on phospho-Ser-127 levels and increased YAP1 nuclear entry. We also found that androgen exposure antagonizes Ser/Thr kinase 4 (STK4/MST1) signaling, stimulates the activity of protein phosphatase 2A, and thereby attenuates the phospho-Ser-127 modification and promotes YAP1 nuclear localization. Results from quantitative RT-PCR and CRISPR/Cas9-aided gene knockout experiments indicated that androgen differentially regulates YAP1-dependent gene expression.

Design:   Two sample univariable and multivariable mendelian randomisation.  Setting:   The UK Biobank prospective cohort study and four large scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) consortiums.  Participants:   453 169 participants enrolled in UK Biobank and a combined total of more than 700 000 people from different GWAS consortiums.  Exposures:   Measured body mass index during adulthood (mean age 56.5) and self-reported perceived body size at age 10.  Main outcome measures:   Coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, breast cancer, and prostate cancer.  Results:   Having a larger genetically predicted body size in early life was associated with an increased odds of coronary artery disease (odds ratio 1.49 for each change in body size category unless stated otherwise, 95% confidence interval 1.33 to 1.68) and type 2 diabetes (2.32, 1.76 to 3.05) based on univariable mendelian randomisation analyses. However, little evidence was found of a direct effect (ie, not through adult body size) based on multivariable mendelian randomisation estimates (coronary artery disease: 1.02, 0.86 to 1.22; type 2 diabetes:1.16, 0.74 to 1.82). In the multivariable mendelian randomisation analysis of breast cancer risk, strong evidence was found of a protective direct effect for larger body size in early life (0.59, 0.50 to 0.71), with less evidence of a direct effect of adult body size on this outcome (1.08, 0.93 to 1.27). Including age at menarche as an additional exposure provided weak evidence of a total causal effect (univariable mendelian randomisation odds ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.91 to 1.06) but strong evidence of a direct causal effect, independent of early life and adult body size (multivariable mendelian randomisation odds ratio 0.90, 0.85 to 0.95). No strong evidence was found of a causal effect of either early or later life measures on prostate cancer (early life body size odds ratio 1.06, 95% confidence interval 0.81 to 1.40; adult body size 0.87, 0.70 to 1.08).  Conclusions:   The findings suggest that the positive association between body size in childhood and risk of coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes in adulthood can be attributed to individuals remaining large into later life. However, having a smaller body size during childhood might increase the risk of breast cancer regardless of body size in adulthood, with timing of puberty also putatively playing a role.""","""['Tom G Richardson', 'Eleanor Sanderson', 'Benjamin Elsworth', 'Kate Tilling', 'George Davey Smith']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMJ""","""['Separating the effects of early and later life adiposity on colorectal cancer risk: a Mendelian randomization study.', 'Childhood adiposity and novel subtypes of diabetes in adults: a Mendelian randomisation and genome-wide genetic correlation study.', 'A data-driven approach for studying the role of body mass in multiple diseases: a phenome-wide registry-based case-control study in the UK Biobank.', 'Causal factors underlying diabetes risk informed by Mendelian randomisation analysis: evidence, opportunities and challenges.', 'The timing of adiposity and changes in the life course on the risk of cancer.', 'Mendelian randomization.', 'Genetic evidence that high BMI in childhood has a protective effect on intermediate diabetes traits, including measures of insulin sensitivity and secretion, after accounting for BMI in adulthood.', 'Genetically proxied impaired GIPR signaling and risk of 6 cancers.', 'Obesity, the Adipose Organ and Cancer in Humans: Association or Causation?', ""Environment- and epigenome-wide association study of obesity in 'Children of 1997' birth cohort.""]"""

Transcriptional re-programming perturbs expression of cell adhesion molecules and underpins metastatic tumour cell behaviour. Decreasing expression of the cell adhesion molecule ITGB4, which encodes the beta subunit of the integrin, alpha6 beta4 (α6β4), has been correlated with increased tumour aggressiveness and metastasis in multiple tumour types including prostate cancer. Paradoxically, in vitro studies in tumour cell models demonstrate that ITGB4 mediates cell mobility and invasion. Herein we examined whether transcriptional re-programming by methylation influenced ITGB4 gene expression at different stages of prostate cancer progression. Bisulphite sequencing of a large CpG island in the ITGB4 gene promoter identified differentially methylated regions in prostate cancer cell lines representing a localised tumour (22Rv1), lymph node metastasis (LNCaP), and a bone metastasis (PC-3). The highest levels of methylation were observed in the CpG island surrounding the ITGB4 transcription start site in PC-3 cells, and this observation also correlated with higher gene expression of ITGB4 in these cells. Furthermore, PC-3 cells expressed two distinct transcripts, using an alternate transcription start site, which was not detected in other cell lines. In prostate tumour biopsy samples, patterns of methylation across the ITGB4 promoter were similar overall in matched primary and metastatic samples (n = 4 pairs), with a trend toward loss of methylation at specific sites in metastatic lesions.""","""['Emma J Wilkinson', 'Alexandra M Woodworth', 'Madeline Parker', 'Jessica L Phillips', 'Roslyn C Malley', 'Joanne L Dickinson', 'Adele F Holloway']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Exp Cell Res""","""['Regulation of the ITGA2 gene by epigenetic mechanisms in prostate cancer.', 'DNA methylation down-regulates integrin β4 expression in asthmatic airway epithelial cells.', 'CpG island promoter methylation and silencing of 14-3-3sigma gene expression in LNCaP and Tramp-C1 prostate cancer cell lines is associated with methyl-CpG-binding protein MBD2.', 'The importance of DNA methylation in prostate cancer development.', 'Prostate Cancer Epigenetics: From Basic Mechanisms to Clinical Implications.', 'Identification and Validation of Anoikis-Related Signatures for Predicting Prognosis in Lung Adenocarcinoma with Machine Learning.', 'Multiomics analysis of adaptation to repeated DNA damage in prostate cancer cells.', 'Regulation of Kinase Signaling Pathways by α6β4-Integrins and Plectin in Prostate Cancer.', 'Implications of differential transcription start site selection on chronic myeloid leukemia and prostate cancer cell protein expression.', 'SPC25 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis via activating the FAK/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway through ITGB4.']"""

Methods:   We conducted a cohort study, where patients with GISTs after another malignancy (AM-GISTs, n = 851) and those with only GISTs (GISTs-1, n = 7660) were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries (1988-2016). Clinicopathologic characteristics and survival were compared between the two groups.  Results:   The most commonly diagnosed first primary malignancy was prostate cancer (27.7%), followed by breast cancer (16.2%). OS among AM-GISTs was significantly inferior to that of GISTs-1; 10-year OS was 40.3% vs. 50.0%, (p < 0.001). A contrary finding was observed for GSS (10-year GSS 68.9% vs. 61.8%, p = 0.002). In the AM-GISTs group, a total of 338 patients died, of which 26.0% died of their initial cancer and 40.8% died of GISTs. Independent of demographics and clinicopathological characteristics, mortality from GISTs among AM-GISTs patients was decreased compared with their GISTs-1 counterparts (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.59-0.84; p < 0.001), whereas OS was inferior among AM-GISTs (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.99-1.25; p = 0.085).

And Immunohistochemistry analysis for ALDH1A3 was performed for those patient samples on tissue microarray. Bioinformatics anslysis was used for RNA sequencing data of both primary prostate cancer and metastatic castration resistance prostate cancer (mCRPC) from online datasets. Crispr-Cas9 was used to knock out ALDH1A3 in prostate cancer luminal cells, and morphologic analysis as well as the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) were facilitated to discover the mechanisms of the resistance phenotype.  Results:   We found that the patients with ALDH1A3 low expression had shorter time to progression to castration resistance compared with those of higher expression group on adjuvant hormonal therapy after radical prostatectomy. The ALDH1A3 knockout cells gradually acquired resistance to androgen deprivation therapy, a few cells have been found in knockout group showing as that the spindle-like luminal cells in charcoal stripped medium. Furthermore, PI3K pathway activation has been confirmed by Western blot. The PI3K pathway inhibitor BEZ235 has been demonstrated that the acquired ADT resistance by ALDH1A3 down regulation could be rescued by PI3K pathway inhibitor.

Methods:   Prostate cancer cases, aged ≥40 years, were identified in the 2004-2014 Pennsylvania Cancer Registry. The 2018 County Health Rankings data and the 2014 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Quality Index were used to extract county-level data. The accelerated failure time models with spatial frailties for geographical correlations were used to assess prostate cancer-specific mortality rates for Pennsylvania and by the Penn State Cancer Institute (PSCI) 28-county catchment area. Secondary assessment based on estimated spatial frailties was conducted to identify potential health and environmental risk factors for mortality.  Results:   There were 94,274 cases included. The 5-year survival rate in PA was 82% (95% confidence interval, CI: 81.1-82.8%), with the catchment area having a lower survival rate 81% (95% CI: 79.5-82.6%) compared to the non-catchment area rate of 82.3% (95% CI: 81.4-83.2%). Black men, uninsured, more aggressive prostate cancer, rural and urban Appalachia, positive lymph nodes, and no definitive treatment were associated with lower survival. Several county-level health (i.e., poor physical activity) and environmental factors in air and land (i.e., defoliate chemical applied) were associated with higher mortality rates.

Methods:   In this cohort study of patients who received a high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation of prostate cancer within a registered prospective single-arm trial, we analyzed posttreatment UTI (≤30 days after HIFU) related to perioperative antibiotic management in an exploratory analysis: single-shot prophylaxis or targeted treatment for bacteriuria. Potential risk factors associated with UTI were evaluated by uni- and multivariate regression analyses.  Results:   In total, 55 patients were eligible for analysis. Of these, 76.4% received antibiotic single-shot prophylaxis. UTI occurred in 10.7% of all patients, 5.4% developed fever, 3.6% required hospitalization. An antibiotic single-shot prophylaxis helped to protect 90.5% of men from infectious complications. Estimated effects indicate that a longer posttreatment catheterization (OR 3.38, 95% CI 0.47-27.08) and larger ablation volume (OR 4.85, 95% CI 0.61-107.49) might be associated with the highest risk for UTI after treatment.

Objective:   To examine the rate of decline of sarcopenia measures (ie, appendicular lean mass [ALM], muscle strength, and physical performance) in older adults with cancer both before and after the cancer diagnosis compared with the trajectory of a population without cancer, and secondarily to assess the association of sarcopenia measures with overall survival and major disability in patients with cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   This matched cohort study included participants from the Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) study, which included 3075 community-dwelling older adults aged 70 to 79 years recruited from a random sample of white Medicare beneficiaries and all eligible black residents in and around Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Memphis, Tennessee, beginning in January 1997 and observed for 17 years until December 2013. Data were analyzed from May 2018 to February 2020.  Exposures:   The development of an adjudicated cancer diagnosis confirmed with pathology or cytology reports during the first 7 years of follow-up.  Main outcomes and measures:   Annual assessments of ALM, hand grip strength, and gait speed were the primary outcome measures. Linear mixed-effect models were used to compare the change in ALM, hand grip strength, and gait speed between individuals who developed cancer and those who did not, adjusted for multiple comparisons (P < .01). Multivariable Cox regression was used to examine the association of sarcopenia measures with overall survival and major disability from date of cancer diagnosis.  Results:   Of the 3075 included patients, 1491 (48.5%) were male, 1281 (41.7%) were black, and the mean (SD) age was 74.1 (2.9) years. A total of 515 patients (16.7%) developed cancer within the first 7 years of the study. The most common cancers were prostate (117 [23.2%]), colorectal (63 [12.5%]), lung (61 [12.1%]), and breast (61 [12.1%]) cancer, and 165 patients (32.0%) were diagnosed as having metastatic disease. Compared with controls without cancer, patients with a cancer diagnosis had a steeper decline in gait speed (β = -0.02; 95% CI, -0.03 to -0.01; P < .001) but not ALM (β = -0.02; 95% CI, -0.07 to 0.04; P = .49) or hand grip strength (β = -0.21; 95% CI, -0.43 to 0; P = .05) prior to cancer diagnosis. After cancer diagnosis, there was a decline in ALM (β = -0.14; 95% CI, -0.23 to -0.05; P < .001) but not hand grip strength (β = -0.02; 95% CI, -0.37 to 0.33; P = .92) or gait speed (β = 0; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.02; P = .51). Declines in ALM after a cancer diagnosis were most striking in patients with metastases (β = -0.32; 95% CI, -0.53 to -0.10; P = .003). Slow gait speed was associated with a 44% increase in mortality (hazard ratio, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.98; P = .02) and a 70% increase in disability (hazard ratio, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.08 to 2.68; P = .02) but not low ALM or hand grip strength.  Conclusions and relevance:   Accelerated losses in differing sarcopenia measures exist both prior to and after a cancer diagnosis and may present opportunities for targeted interventions to improve outcomes.""","""['Grant R Williams', 'Yanjun Chen', 'Kelly M Kenzik', 'Andrew McDonald', 'Shlomit S Shachar', 'Heidi D Klepin', 'Stephen Kritchevsky', 'Smita Bhatia']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Putative Cut-Points in Sarcopenia Components and Incident Adverse Health Outcomes: An SDOC Analysis.', 'Do Different Ascertainment Techniques Identify the Same Individuals as Sarcopenic in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging?', 'Appendicular Lean Mass, Grip Strength, and the Development of Hospital-Associated Activities of Daily Living Disability Among Older Adults in the Health ABC Study.', 'Assessment of Lean Mass and Physical Performance in Sarcopenia.', 'Depression and Hand-Grip: Unraveling the Association.', 'Development and validation of a portable articulated dynamometry system to assess knee extensor muscle strength.', 'The effects of exercise with or without dietary advice on muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical functioning among older cancer survivors: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.', 'Comparison of Frailty Criteria, Cognitive Function, Depressive and Insomnia Symptoms in Men with Localized and Advanced Prostate Cancer under Androgen Deprivation Therapy.', 'Imaging modalities for measuring body composition in patients with cancer: opportunities and challenges.', 'Pharmacokinetics of cancer therapeutics and energy balance: the role of diet intake, energy expenditure, and body composition.']"""

Biopsies guided by bi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can aid PCa diagnosis. Previous works have mostly focused on either detection or classification of PCa from MRI. In this work, however, we present a neural network that simultaneously detects and grades cancer tissue in an end-to-end fashion. This is more clinically relevant than the classification goal of the ProstateX-2 challenge. We used the dataset of this challenge for training and testing. We use a 2D U-Net with MRI slices as input and lesion segmentation maps that encode the Gleason Grade Group (GGG), a measure for cancer aggressiveness, as output. We propose a method for encoding the GGG in the model target that takes advantage of the fact that the classes are ordinal. Furthermore, we evaluate methods for incorporating prostate zone segmentations as prior information, and ensembling techniques. The model scored a voxel-wise weighted kappa of 0.446 ±0.082 and a Dice similarity coefficient for segmenting clinically significant cancer of 0.370 ±0.046, obtained using 5-fold cross-validation. The lesion-wise weighted kappa on the ProstateX-2 challenge test set was 0.13 ±0.27. We show that our proposed model target outperforms standard multiclass classification and multi-label ordinal regression.

Materials and methods:   Records for patients with metastatic prostate cancer were abstracted from the National Inpatient Sample database (2008-2015).  Results:   Of 6,963 patients with metastatic prostate cancer 3,881 (72.2%) were Caucasian and 1,494 (27.8%) were African American. Bone metastases were the most common site of metastases in Caucasian and African American patients (83.9% and 87.0%, respectively), followed by distant lymph node metastases in Caucasian (13.9% of Caucasian vs 13.2% of African American), liver metastases in African American (13.8% of African American vs 13.3% of Caucasian) and lung metastases in Caucasian and African American patients (9.3% and 13.1%, respectively). No clinically meaningful differences were recorded in age and race analyses, except for lymph node metastases (61.1% to 23.4% in Caucasian vs 39.0% to 25.1% in African American patients), which decreased with age. Specific single organ metastatic sites, outside of bone and lymph nodes, were low in both racial groups (2.1% or less). The rate of brain metastases was also rare in both racial groups at 1.4% or less, regardless of other metastatic locations. Thoracic metastases, in the absence of bone and abdominal metastases, were present in 1.9% of Caucasian and African American patients.  Conclusions:   The most important finding according to age and race resided in rates of lymph node metastases. Conversely, all other racial and age related differences were subtle. Nonetheless, they are important in the context of planning and/or design of clinical trials. Finally, brain (1.4%) and thoracic (1.9%) metastases affect few patients and routine brain and chest imaging may not be warranted.""","""['Lara Franziska Stolzenbach', 'Giuseppe Rosiello', 'Marina Deuker', 'Claudia Collà-Ruvolo', 'Luigi Nocera', 'Zhe Tian', 'Derya Tilki', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Fred Saad', 'Felix K H Chun', 'Markus Graefen', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Editorial Comment.', 'Distribution of metastatic sites in patients with prostate cancer: A population-based analysis.', 'A Head-to-head Comparison of Four Prognostic Models for Prediction of Lymph Node Invasion in African American and Caucasian Individuals.', 'Racial disparities in the development of breast cancer metastases among older women: a multilevel study.', 'Racial disparity in clinical course and outcome of metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer.', 'Age-related racial disparities in prostate cancer patients: A systematic review.', 'Racial/ethnic disparities in the distribution and effect of type and number of high-risk criteria on mortality in prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy.', 'The Clinical, Diagnostic, Therapeutic, and Prognostic Characteristics of Brain Metastases in Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Construction and Comparison of Different Models in Detecting Prostate Cancer and Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', 'Application of Machine Learning Techniques to Predict Bone Metastasis in Patients with Prostate Cancer.', 'Survival advantage of Asian metastatic prostate cancer patients treated with external beam radiotherapy over other races/ethnicities.']"""

Method:   People with ID who were ≥55years old and alive at the end of 2012 (n = 7936; ID cohort) were identified through a national register of people with ID who received social services in Sweden to optimise the individual's opportunity for good living conditions in daily life. An equally large reference cohort from the general population (gPop cohort) was matched by year of birth and sex. Cancer diagnoses registered in inpatient and outpatient specialist care were collected for 2002-2012 from the ID cohort and compared with diagnoses in the gPop cohort.  Results:   A lower total cancer frequency was observed in the ID cohort, which contained 555 cancers, compared with 877 cancers in the gPop cohort [odds ratio (OR): 0.63; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.57-0.70]. Women accounted for 60% of cancers in the ID cohort. Breast and gynaecological organ cancers had similar or slightly lower frequencies in the ID cohort than in the general population, with breast OR of 0.95, uterine corpus OR of 1.00 and ovary OR of 0.73. Surprisingly, cancer frequency of the digestive organs (OR: 0.67), including the colon (OR: 0.82), was lower than in the general population. Cancers of the prostate (OR: 0.25), urinary tract (OR: 0.42) and lung were less frequent than in the general population.  Conclusions:   Cancer was diagnosed less frequently in the ID cohort than in the gPop cohort.

Bone metastases can significantly increase mortality and decrease the quality of life of cancer patients. In the United States, around 350,000 people die each year from bone metastases. This study aimed to analyze and update the incidence and prognosis of bone metastases with solid tumors at the time of cancer diagnosis and its incidence rate for each solid cancer.  Methods:   We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to find patients diagnosed with solid cancers originating from outside the bones and joints between 2010 and 2016. Data were stratified by age, sex, and race. Patients with a tumor in situ or with an unknown bone metastases stage were excluded. We then selected most of the sites where cancer often occurred, leaving 2,207,796 patients for the final incidence analysis. For the survival analysis, patients were excluded if they were diagnosed at their autopsy or on their death certificate, or had unknown follow-ups. The incidence of bone metastases and overall survival was compared between patients with different primary tumor sites.  Results:   We identified 2,470,634 patients, including 426,594 patients with metastatic disease and 113,317 patients with bone metastases, for incidence analysis. The incidence of bone metastases among the metastatic subset was 88.74% in prostate cancer, 53.71% in breast cancer, and 38.65% in renal cancer. In descending order of incidence, there were patients with other cancers in the genitourinary system (except for renal, bladder, prostate, and testicular cancer) (37.91%), adenocarcinoma of the lung (ADC) (36.86%), other gynecologic cancers (36.02%), small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) (34.56%), non-small cell lung cancer not otherwise specified and others [NSCLC (NOS/others)] (33.55%), and bladder (31.08%) cancers. The rate of bone metastases is 23.19% in SCLC, 22.50% in NSCLC (NOS/others), 20.28% in ADC, 8.44% in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (SCC), and 4.11% in bronchioloalveolar carcinoma [NSCLC (BAC)]. As for the digestive system, the overall bone metastases rate was 7.99% in the esophagus, 4.47% in the gastric cancer, 4.42% in the hepatobiliary cancer, 3.80% in the pancreas, 3.26% in other digestive organs, 1.24% in the colorectum, and 1.00% in the anus. Overall, the incidence rate of bone metastases among the entire cohort in breast and prostate cancer was 3.73% and 5.69%, respectively.  Conclusions:   The results of this study provide population-based estimates for the incidence rates of patients with bone metastases at initial diagnosis of their solid tumor. The findings can help clinicians to early detect bone metastases by bone screening to anticipate the occurrence of symptoms and favorably improve the prognosis.""","""['Jin-Feng Huang', 'Jianfei Shen', 'Xiao Li', 'Ramesh Rengan', 'Nicola Silvestris', 'Minqi Wang', 'Lisa Derosa', 'Xuanqi Zheng', 'Andrea Belli', 'Xiao-Lei Zhang', 'Yan Michael Li', 'Aimin Wu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Ann Transl Med""","""['Incidence and prognosis of patients with brain metastases at diagnosis of systemic malignancy: a population-based study.', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Brain Metastases in Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer: A Population-Based Study.', 'A systematic review of evidence on malignant spinal metastases: natural history and technologies for identifying patients at high risk of vertebral fracture and spinal cord compression.', 'An overview of mortality & predictors of small-cell and non-small cell lung cancer among Saudi patients.', 'p16 Immunohistochemical Expression in Nephrogenic Adenoma.', ""A cross-sectional study on Chinese oncology nurses' knowledge of bone health among cancer patients."", 'The Importance of Awaiting Biopsy Results in Solitary Pathological Proximal Femoral Fractures : Do We Need to Biopsy Solitary Pathological Fractures?', 'Checkpoint Inhibitors in Bone Metastatic Disease in Solid Tumors.', 'Amino Acid Metabolism in Bone Metastatic Disease.']"""

Here we investigated the possible anticancer properties of neferine, a natural alkaloid, on human prostate cancer (PCa) cells and their stem cells. CD44+ CSCs were isolated from androgen-insensitive PC3 cells by magnetic-activated cell sorting system (MACS). Neferine dose-and time-dependently inhibited the viability of PC3 and CSCs as well as androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells through inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G1 phase. Neferine was shown to downregulate the expression of Bcl-2 and CDK4, and upregulate caspase 3, clePARP, p21, p27, and p53. The treatment significantly inhibits the migration of CSCs. Neferine induces JNK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation, and downregulates PI3K and NF-ĸβ signaling. In conclusion, neferine may have a therapeutic effect inhibiting the PCa cell proliferation as well as by eliminating CSCs. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Neferine is an alkaloid found in the seed embryo of Nelumbo nucifera and has recently been shown to have anticancer effects on various human cancer cells. More than 90% of cancer-related deaths develop after metastasis, and CSCs are considered to be largely responsible for the cell migration and invasion. It has been shown that treatment of neferine kills not only PCa cells but also CSCs, and may contribute to the prevention of progression of PCa and metastasis by inhibiting cell proliferation and migration.""","""['Suat Erdogan', 'Kader Turkekul']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Food Biochem""","""['Neferine, an alkaloid ingredient in lotus seed embryo, inhibits proliferation of human osteosarcoma cells by promoting p38 MAPK-mediated p21 stabilization.', 'Neferine inhibits epidermal growth factor-induced proliferation and migration of retinal pigment epithelial cells through downregulating p38 MAPK and PI3K/AKT signalling.', 'Neferine, an alkaloid from lotus seed embryo, inhibits human lung cancer cell growth by MAPK activation and cell cycle arrest.', 'The flavonoid apigenin reduces prostate cancer CD44(+) stem cell survival and migration through PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling.', 'An updated review on pharmacological properties of neferine-A bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid from Nelumbo nucifera.', 'Optimization of Neferine Purification Based on Response Surface Methodology and Its Anti-Metastasis Mechanism on HepG2 Cells.', 'Neferine attenuates development of testosterone-induced benign prostatic hyperplasia in mice by regulating androgen and TGF-β/Smad signaling pathways.', 'State-of-the-art therapeutic strategies for targeting cancer stem cells in prostate cancer.', 'Combined effects of vitamin D and neferine on the progression and metastasis of colorectal cancer.', 'Phytochemicals in Inhibition of Prostate Cancer: Evidence from Molecular Mechanisms Studies.']"""

Methods:   Observational study of meeting guidelines for moderate intensity physical activity in a retrospective cohort of African American and white prostate cancer survivors (n = 89).  Results:   Thirty-four percent of survivors met the recommended guidelines for moderate intensity physical activity. There were no racial differences in physical activity between African American and white prostate cancer survivors; however, the likelihood of meeting guidelines was associated significantly with stage of disease, self-rated health, and perceptions of stress. Survivors who had stage pT2c or higher disease had a significantly reduced likelihood of meeting recommended guidelines for physical activity (OR = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.08, 0.86, p = 0.03).

In this study, we aimed to improve the accuracy of estimated attenuation maps from MRI Dixon contrast images by training an augmented generative adversarial network (GANs) in a supervised manner. We augmented the GANs by perturbing the non-linear deformation field during image registration between MRI and the ground truth CT images.  Methods:   We acquired the CT and the corresponding PET-MR images for a cohort of 28 prostate cancer patients. Data from 18 patients (2160 slices and later augmented to 270,000 slices) was used for training the GANs and others for validation. We calculated the error in bone and soft tissue regions for the AC μ-maps and the reconstructed PET images.  Results:   For quantitative analysis, we use the average relative absolute errors and validate the proposed technique on 10 patients. The DL-based MR methods generated the pseudo-CT AC μ-maps with an accuracy of 4.5% more than standard MR-based techniques. Particularly, the proposed method demonstrates improved accuracy in the pelvic regions without affecting the uptake values. The lowest error of the AC μ-map in the pelvic region was 1.9% for μ-mapGAN + aug compared with 6.4% for μ-mapdixon, 5.9% for μ-mapdixon + bone, 2.1% for μ-mapU-Net and 2.0% for μ-mapU-Net + aug. For the reconstructed PET images, the lowest error was 2.2% for PETGAN + aug compared with 10.3% for PETdixon, 8.7% for PETdixon + bone, 2.6% for PETU-Net and 2.4% for PETU-Net + aug..

To better understand this relationship, we used a multiscale mathematical model that integrates data from biology and pathology on the microenvironmental regulation of PCa cell behaviour. Our data indicate that the interactions between tumour cells and their environment shape the evolutionary dynamics of PCa cells and explain overall tumour aggressiveness. A key environmental determinant of this aggressiveness is the stromal ecology, which can be either inhibitory, highly reactive (supportive) or non-reactive (neutral). Our results show that stromal ecology correlates directly with tumour growth but inversely modulates tumour evolution. This suggests that aggressive, environmentally independent PCa may be a result of poor stromal ecology, supporting the concept that purely tumour epithelium-centric metrics of aggressiveness may be incomplete and that incorporating markers of stromal ecology would improve prognosis.""","""['Ziv Frankenstein', 'David Basanta', 'Omar E Franco', 'Yan Gao', 'Rodrigo A Javier', 'Douglas W Strand', 'MinJae Lee', 'Simon W Hayward#', 'Gustavo Ayala#', 'Alexander R A Anderson#']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Nat Ecol Evol""","""['Investigating prostate cancer tumour-stroma interactions: clinical and biological insights from an evolutionary game.', 'Using high throughput microtissue culture to study the difference in prostate cancer cell behavior and drug response in 2D and 3D co-cultures.', 'Asporin is a stromally expressed marker associated with prostate cancer progression.', 'Progesterone receptor in the prostate: A potential suppressor for benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Nasopharyngeal carcinoma ecology theory: cancer as multidimensional spatiotemporal ""unity of ecology and evolution"" pathological ecosystem.', 'Prostate Cancer Tumor Stroma: Responsibility in Tumor Biology, Diagnosis and Treatment.', 'Small extracellular vesicle DNA-mediated horizontal gene transfer as a driving force for tumor evolution: Facts and riddles.', 'Second generation androgen receptor antagonists and challenges in prostate cancer treatment.', 'Tumor microenvironment heterogeneity an important mediator of prostate cancer progression and therapeutic resistance.']"""

The gold standard for detecting PrCa is the examination of prostate needle core biopsies. Diagnosis can be challenging, especially for small, well-differentiated cancers. Recently, machine learning algorithms have been developed for detecting PrCa in whole slide images (WSIs) with high test accuracy. However, the impact of these artificial intelligence systems on pathologic diagnosis is not known. To address this, we investigated how pathologists interact with Paige Prostate Alpha, a state-of-the-art PrCa detection system, in WSIs of prostate needle core biopsies stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Three AP-board certified pathologists assessed 304 anonymized prostate needle core biopsy WSIs in 8 hours. The pathologists classified each WSI as benign or cancerous. After ~4 weeks, pathologists were tasked with re-reviewing each WSI with the aid of Paige Prostate Alpha. For each WSI, Paige Prostate Alpha was used to perform cancer detection and, for WSIs where cancer was detected, the system marked the area where cancer was detected with the highest probability. The original diagnosis for each slide was rendered by genitourinary pathologists and incorporated any ancillary studies requested during the original diagnostic assessment. Against this ground truth, the pathologists and Paige Prostate Alpha were measured. Without Paige Prostate Alpha, pathologists had an average sensitivity of 74% and an average specificity of 97%. With Paige Prostate Alpha, the average sensitivity for pathologists significantly increased to 90% with no statistically significant change in specificity. With Paige Prostate Alpha, pathologists more often correctly classified smaller, lower grade tumors, and spent less time analyzing each WSI. Future studies will investigate if similar benefit is yielded when such a system is used to detect other forms of cancer in a setting that more closely emulates real practice.""","""['Patricia Raciti#', 'Jillian Sue#', 'Rodrigo Ceballos', 'Ran Godrich', 'Jeremy D Kunz', 'Supriya Kapur', 'Victor Reuter', 'Leo Grady', 'Christopher Kanan', 'David S Klimstra', 'Thomas J Fuchs']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mod Pathol""","""['An independent assessment of an artificial intelligence system for prostate cancer detection shows strong diagnostic accuracy.', 'Independent real-world application of a clinical-grade automated prostate cancer detection system.', 'An artificial intelligence algorithm for prostate cancer diagnosis in whole slide images of core needle biopsies: a blinded clinical validation and deployment study.', 'A Hybrid Human-Machine Learning Approach for Screening Prostate Biopsies Can Improve Clinical Efficiency Without Compromising Diagnostic Accuracy.', 'Validation of Whole-Slide Imaging for Histolopathogical Diagnosis: Current State.', 'Artificial intelligence and urology: ethical considerations for urologists and patients.', 'Artificial intelligence applications in prostate cancer.', 'CONFIDENT-trial protocol: a pragmatic template for clinical implementation of artificial intelligence assistance in pathology.', 'Future of prostate imaging: Artificial intelligence in assessing prostatic magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Tissue contamination challenges the credibility of machine learning models in real world digital pathology.']"""

Furthermore, most genome-wide association studies have used genotyping arrays that are hindered by SNP ascertainment bias. To overcome these disparities in genomic medicine, the Men of African Descent and Carcinoma of the Prostate (MADCaP) Network has developed a genotyping array that is optimized for African populations. The MADCaP Array contains more than 1.5 million markers and an imputation backbone that successfully tags over 94% of common genetic variants in African populations. This array also has a high density of markers in genomic regions associated with cancer susceptibility, including 8q24. We assessed the effectiveness of the MADCaP Array by genotyping 399 prostate cancer cases and 403 controls from seven urban study sites in sub-Saharan Africa. Samples from Ghana and Nigeria clustered together, whereas samples from Senegal and South Africa yielded distinct ancestry clusters. Using the MADCaP array, we identified cancer-associated loci that have large allele frequency differences across African populations. Polygenic risk scores for prostate cancer were higher in Nigeria than in Senegal. In summary, individual and population-level differences in prostate cancer risk were revealed using a novel genotyping array.

Recently, convolutional neural networks have been proposed to speed-up and automatise this procedure, obtaining promising results. With the advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided radiotherapy, MR-based segmentation is becoming increasingly relevant. However, the majority of the studies investigated automatic contouring based on computed tomography (CT).  Purpose:   In this study, we investigate the feasibility of clinical use of deep learning-based automatic OARs delineation on MRI.  Materials and methods:   We included 150 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer who underwent MR-only radiotherapy. A three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted dual spoiled gradient-recalled echo sequence was acquired with 3T MRI for the generation of the synthetic-CT. The first 48 patients were included in a feasibility study training two 3D convolutional networks called DeepMedic and dense V-net (dV-net) to segment bladder, rectum and femurs. A research version of an atlas-based software was considered for comparison. Dice similarity coefficient, 95% Hausdorff distances (HD95), and mean distances were calculated against clinical delineations. For eight patients, an expert RTT scored the quality of the contouring for all the three methods. A choice among the three approaches was made, and the chosen approach was retrained on 97 patients and implemented for automatic use in the clinical workflow. For the successive 53 patients, Dice, HD95 and mean distances were calculated against the clinically used delineations.  Results:   DeepMedic, dV-net and the atlas-based software generated contours in 60 s, 4 s and 10-15 min, respectively. Performances were higher for both the networks compared to the atlas-based software. The qualitative analysis demonstrated that delineation from DeepMedic required fewer adaptations, followed by dV-net and the atlas-based software. DeepMedic was clinically implemented. After retraining DeepMedic and testing on the successive patients, the performances slightly improved.  Conclusion:   High conformality for OARs delineation was achieved with two in-house trained networks, obtaining a significant speed-up of the delineation procedure. Comparison of different approaches has been performed leading to the succesful adoption of one of the neural networks, DeepMedic, in the clinical workflow. DeepMedic maintained in a clinical setting the accuracy obtained in the feasibility study.""","""['Mark H F Savenije', 'Matteo Maspero', 'Gonda G Sikkes', 'Jochem R N van der Voort van Zyp', 'Alexis N T J Kotte', 'Gijsbert H Bol', 'Cornelis A T van den Berg']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Patient-specific transfer learning for auto-segmentation in adaptive 0.35 T MRgRT of prostate cancer: a bi-centric evaluation.', 'Automated delineation of head and neck organs at risk using synthetic MRI-aided mask scoring regional convolutional neural network.', 'Automatic segmentation of the clinical target volume and organs at risk in the planning CT for rectal cancer using deep dilated convolutional neural networks.', 'Auto-segmentation of organs at risk for head and neck radiotherapy planning: From atlas-based to deep learning methods.', 'Clinical implementation of deep-learning based auto-contouring tools-Experience of three French radiotherapy centers.', 'Deep learning for automated contouring of neurovascular structures on magnetic resonance imaging for prostate cancer patients.', 'Deep Learning in MRI-guided Radiation Therapy: A Systematic Review.', 'Beyond diagnosis: is there a role for radiomics in prostate cancer management?', 'Magnetic resonance imaging organ at risk delineation for nasopharyngeal radiotherapy: Measuring the effectiveness of an educational intervention.', 'Region-adaptive magnetic resonance image enhancement for improving CNN-based segmentation of the prostate and prostatic zones.']"""

Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) was chosen for standardization of QI analysis outputs. Support of improved integration with community repositories focused on The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Priorities included improved capabilities of the standard, toolkits and tools, reference datasets, collaborations, and training and outreach.  Results:   Fourteen new tools to support head and neck cancer, glioblastoma, and prostate cancer QI research were introduced and downloaded over 100,000 times. DICOM was amended, with over 40 correction proposals addressing QI needs. Reference implementations of the standard in a popular toolkit and standalone tools were introduced. Eight datasets exemplifying the application of the standard and tools were contributed. An open demonstration/connectathon was organized, attracting the participation of academic groups and commercial vendors. Integration of tools with TCIA was improved by implementing programmatic communication interface and by refining best practices for QI analysis results curation.

Human prostate cancer LNCaP and DU145 cells treated with HDAC inhibitors, sodium butyrate, and trichostatin A, resulted in maspin re-expression. Interestingly, an exploration into the molecular mechanisms demonstrates that maspin repression in prostate tumor and human prostate cancer cell lines occurs via epigenetic silencing through an increase in HDAC activity/expression, independent of promoter DNA hypermethylation. Furthermore, transcriptional activation of maspin was accompanied with the suppression of HDAC1 and HDAC8 with significant p53 enrichment at the maspin promoter associated with an increase in histone H3/H4 acetylation.

After injection, the radiotracer is distributed throughout the entire body, with a higher uptake in tissues where targeted receptors are overexpressed. The use of beta/gamma radionuclide emitters enables therapy imaging (beta-emission) and post-therapy imaging (gamma-emission) to be performed at the same time. Post-treatment sequential images permit absorbed dose calculation based on local uptake and wash-in/wash-out kinetics. We implemented a hybrid method that combines information derived from both 2D and 3D images. Serial whole-body images and blood samples are acquired to estimate the absorbed dose to different organs at risk and to lesions disseminated throughout the body. A single 3D-SPECT/CT image, limited to the abdominal region, overcomes projection overlap on planar images of different structures such as the intestines and kidneys. The hybrid 2D+3D-SPECT/CT method combines the effective half-life information derived from 2D planar images with the local uptake distribution derived from 3D images. We implemented this methodology to estimate the absorbed dose for patients undergoing PRRT with 177Lu-PSMA-617. The methodology could, however, be implemented with other beta-gamma radiotracers.

However, PD-L1 expression in tumor biopsies does not necessarily correlate with response to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Thus, a reliable predictive biomarker is urgently needed. Here, the expression of PD-L1 on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in blood from patients with advanced UC was analyzed. For this purpose, an assay to test PD-L1 expression on CTCs using the CellSearch® system was established using cells of five UC cell lines spiked into blood samples from healthy donors and applied to a heterogeneous cohort of UC patients. Enumeration of CTCs was performed in blood samples from 49 patients with advanced UC. PD-L1 expression in ≥1 CTC was found in 10 of 16 CTC-positive samples (63%). Both intra- and inter-patient heterogeneity regarding PD-L1 expression of CTCs were observed. Furthermore, vimentin-expressing CTCs were detected in 4 of 15 CTC-positive samples (27%), independently of PD-L1 analysis. Both CTC detection and presence of CTCs with moderate or strong PD-L1 expression correlated with worse overall survival.

Castration-resistant disease (CRD) is the most advanced stage of the disease and is difficult to control. Patients with CRD may no longer accept conventional therapies as they are not in appropriate clinical conditions or they refuse to receive it. Given that inflammation is an essential component of CRD origin and progression, anti-inflammatory agents could be a therapeutic option with fenamates as one of the proposed choices. A prospective, randomized, double-blinded, 2-arm, parallel group, phase II-III clinical trial was performed involving 20 patients with CRD-PCa (with a prostate specific antigen level <100 ng/ml) that were undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and did not accept any established treatment for that disease stage. In addition to ADT, 10 patients received placebo and 10 received mefenamic acid (500 mg orally every 12 h) for 6 months. The primary endpoint was the change in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at 6 months. The PSA levels decreased significantly with mefenamic acid (an average 42% decrease), whereas there was an average 55% increase in the placebo group (P=0.024). In the patients treated with the placebo, 70% had biochemical disease progression (an increase of ≥25% in PSA levels), which did not occur in any of the patients treated with mefenamic acid (relative risk=0.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.85; P=0.033). There was a significant increase in quality of life (EQ-5D-5L score) and body mass index (BMI) with the experimental treatment. In conclusion, mefenamic acid administration decreased biochemical progression in patients with castration resistant PCa, improved their quality of life and increased their BMI.

This study aimed to investigate the roles of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor/tropomyosin receptor kinase B (BDNF/TrkB) pathway in PCa progression. It was demonstrated by immunohistochemical analysis that both BDNF and TrkB were overexpressed in PCa tissues and elevated TrkB expression was tightly related with lymph node metastasis and advanced stage of PCa. In vitro studies showed that stimulation with rhBDNF or overexpression of TrkB in PCa cells promoted cell migration, invasion, and anoikis resistance. Overexpression of TrkB also resulted in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like transformation in cell morphology, whereas RNA interference-mediated TrkB depletion caused reversion of EMT. Further investigation demonstrated that protein kinase B (AKT) was responsible for BDNF/TrkB signaling-induced pro-migratory and pro-invasive effects, EMT, and anoikis resistance. Finally, in vivo studies confirmed that enhanced TrkB expression facilitated tumor growth, whereas downregulation of TrkB suppressed tumor growth. Our findings illustrate that BDNF/TrkB pathway is crucial for PCa progression, which may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of advanced PCa.""","""['Tao Li', 'Ying Yu', 'Yarong Song', 'Xuechao Li', 'Dongyang Lan', 'Peng Zhang', 'Yajun Xiao', 'Yifei Xing']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""FASEB J""","""['Upregulation of TrkB promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and anoikis resistance in endometrial carcinoma.', 'Upregulation of the BDNF/TrKB pathway promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition, as well as the migration and invasion of cervical cancer.', 'Proliferative role of BDNF/TrkB signaling is associated with anoikis resistance in cervical cancer.', 'Role of Tropomyosin-related kinase B receptor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in cancer.', 'Brain-derived neurotrophic factor in gastroenterology oncology - short review of current literature.', 'Serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) as predictors of childhood neuroblastoma relapse.', 'Anoikis in phenotypic reprogramming of the prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'The SLITRK4-CNPY3 axis promotes liver metastasis of gastric cancer by enhancing the endocytosis and recycling of TrkB in tumour cells.', 'The Function of BDNF and Its Receptor in the Male Genitourinary System and Its Potential Clinical Application.', 'Multivariate logistic regression analysis of the correlation between five biomarkers and ovarian cancer in patients with intermediate-risk: A prospective cross-sectional study.']"""

A tissue microarray containing 371 cases of ascending grades of gliomas pertaining to astrocytic origin and samples of 52 cases of primary lung carcinomas with matching BM with follow-up time accounting to 10.4 years was evaluated for PSMA expression using immunohistochemistry. In addition, PSMA expression was studied in BM arising from melanomas and breast carcinomas. Neovascular expression of PSMA was evident alongside with high expression in the proliferating microvasculature of glioblastomas when compared to the tumour cell expression. This result correlated with the results obtained from the in silico (cancer genome databases) analyses. In gliomas, only the vascular expression of PSMA associated with poor overall survival but not the tumour cell expression.

Here, we compared telomere lengths in prostatic SCNC and usual-type prostatic adenocarcinoma (AdCa). We studied 32 cases of prostatic SCNC (including 11 cases with concurrent AdCa) and 347 cases of usual-type AdCa on tissue microarrays. Telomere lengths in tumor cells were qualitatively compared with those in normal cells using a telomere-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization assay. ERG, PTEN, and TP53 status were assessed in a proportion of cases using genetically validated immunohistochemistry protocols. Clinicopathological and molecular characteristics of cases were compared between the telomere groups using the chi-square test.A significantly higher proportion of prostatic SCNC cases (50%, 16/32) showed normal/long telomeres compared with AdCa cases (11%, 39/347; P < 0.0001). In 82% (9/11) of cases with concurrent SCNC and AdCa, the paired components were concordant for telomere length status. Among AdCa cases, the proportion of cases with normal/long telomeres significantly increased with increasing tumor grade group (P = 0.01) and pathologic stage (P = 0.02). Cases with normal/long telomeres were more likely to be ERG positive (P = 0.04) and to have TP53 missense mutation (P = 0.01) than cases with short telomeres.Normal or long telomere lengths are significantly more common in prostatic SCNC than in AdCa and are similar between concurrent SCNC and AdCa tumors, supporting a common origin.

Patients and methods:   From January 2016 to June 2019, 105 men with PI-RADS score 5 underwent mpMRI/transrectal ultrasound fusion biopsy combined with systematic prostate biopsy. All the patients underwent a 3.0 Tesla pelvic mpMRI for the first time before prostate biopsy. In detail, the detection rate for clinically significant prostate cancer (PCa) and the follow-up of the patients without proven diagnosis of PCa has been reported.  Results:   In 91 (86.7%) of 105 patients, a stage T1c PCa was diagnosed, and 89 (84.5%) of 105 of them were classified as clinically significant PCa. Among the 16 (15.5%) of 105 patients with absence of cancer, 5 (31.5%) of 16 had an aspecific granulomatous prostatitis, 1 (6.2%) of 16 had a specific granulomatous prostatitis secondary to prostatic Mycobacterium Tubercolosis, and 10 (62.3%) of 16 had a diagnosis of normal parenchyma. The 6 patients with granulomatous prostatitis underwent specific antibiotic therapy followed by laboratory (ie, semen and urine cultures) and clinical evaluation. Six months from prostate biopsy, none of the 16 patients underwent repeat prostate biopsy because prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (15/16 cases) plus PSA density significantly decreased; in addition, in all the cases the initial PI-RADS score 5 was downgraded at mpMRI revaluation to PI-RADS score ≤ 3.

The majority of metastases overexpress prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), making it an ideal candidate for targeted radionuclide therapy.  Objective:   The aim of this study was to test a novel liquid 224Ra/212Pb-generator for the rapid preparation of a dual-alpha targeting solution. Here, PSMA-targeting ligands are labelled with 212Pb in the 224Ra-solution in transient equilibrium with daughter nuclides. Thus, natural bone-seeking 224Ra targeting sclerotic bone metastases and 212Pb-chelated PSMA ligands targeting PSMA-expressing tumour cells are obtained.  Methods:   Two PSMA-targeting ligands, the p-SCN-Bn-TCMC-PSMA ligand (NG001), specifically developed for chelating 212Pb, and the most clinically used DOTA-based PSMA-617 were labelled with 212Pb. Radiolabelling and targeting potential were investigated in situ, in vitro (PSMA-positive C4-2 human prostate cancer cells) and in vivo (athymic mice bearing C4-2 xenografts).  Results:   NG001 was rapidly labelled with 212Pb (radiochemical purity >94% at concentrations of ≥15 μg/ml) using the liquid 224Ra/212Pb-generator. The high radiochemical purity and stability of [212Pb]Pb- NG001 were demonstrated over 48 hours in the presence of ascorbic acid and albumin. Similar binding abilities of the 212Pb-labelled ligands were observed in C4-2 cells. The PSMA ligands displayed comparable tumour uptake after 2 hours, but NG001 showed a 3.5-fold lower kidney uptake than PSMA- 617. Radium-224 was not chelated and, hence, showed high uptake in bones.  Conclusion:   A fast method for the labelling of PSMA ligands with 212Pb in the 224Ra/212Pb-solution was developed.

Synthetic PIF (sPIF) has both immune-protective and regenerative properties, and reduces oxidative stress and protein misfolding. PIF is detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in hyperplastic endometriotic lesions and advanced uterine cancer. sPIF reduces graft-versus-host disease while maintaining a graft-versus-leukemia effect.  Methods:   PIF detection in prostate cancer was assessed in 50 human prostate samples following radical prostatectomy using tumor-microarray-based IHC correlating PIF immune staining with Gleason score (GS) and cancer aggressiveness.  Results:   PIF was detected in moderate-to-high risk prostate cancer (GS 4+3 and beyond, prognostic groups 3 to 5). In prostate cancer (GS (WHO Grade Group (GG)5), PIF was detected in 50% of cases; in prostate cancer (GS 4+4 GG4), PIF was observed in 62.5% of cases; in prostate cancer (GS 4+3 GG3), PIF immunostaining was observed in 57.1% of cases. In prostate cancer, (GS 3+4 GG2) and (GS 3+3 GG1) cases where PIF staining was negative to weak, membranous staining was observed in 20% of cases (staining pattern considered negative). High-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia PIF positive stain in 28.57% of cases (6 of 21) was observed. In contrast, PIF was not detected in normal prostate glands. Importantly, sPIF added to the PC3 cell line alone or combined with prostate cancer fibroblast feeder-cells did not affect proliferation. Only when peripheral blood mononuclear cells were added to the culture, a minor increase in cell proliferation was noted, reflecting local proliferation control.

There are significant differences in therapeutic strategies of the different NEN subtypes, and therefore, precise classification of pulmonary NENs is critical. However, challenges in pulmonary NEN classification include overlap of diagnostic histological features among the subtypes and reduced or negative expression of neuroendocrine markers in poorly differentiated pulmonary NECs. Recently, transcription factor insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1) was identified as a sensitive marker of neuroendocrine and neuroepithelial differentiation. In this study, INSM1 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in greater than 94% of pulmonary NENs, indicating that it is a highly sensitive marker of pulmonary NENs and is useful to detect poorly differentiated pulmonary NECs. Although there are well-established morphological and immunohistologic criteria to diagnose pulmonary NENs, there is no universal consensus regarding prognostic markers of pulmonary NENs. Studies have shown that non-small cell lung cancers express long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which regulate gene expression, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and carcinogenesis. We characterized expression and function of lncRNAs, including HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR), maternally expressed 3 (MEG3), and prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) in pulmonary NENs, including typical carcinoid tumors, atypical carcinoid tumors, small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC/NEC), and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC/NEC). In situ hybridization and real-time polymerase chain reaction studies showed higher expression (p < 0.01) of all lncRNAs in SCLC/NEC. Small interfering RNA studies indicated a role for MEG3 and PCA3 in tumor proliferation. Therefore, these lncRNAs may serve as prognostic indicators of pulmonary NEN aggressiveness and as possible therapeutic targets.""","""['Damodaran Narayanan', 'Rakesh Mandal', 'Heather Hardin', 'Vishal Chanana', 'Michael Schwalbe', 'Jason Rosenbaum', 'Darya Buehler', 'Ricardo V Lloyd']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Endocr Pathol""","""['Gastroenteropancreatic High-Grade Neuroendocrine Neoplasms: Histology and Molecular Analysis, Two Sides of the Same Coin.', 'SOX11 is a sensitive and specific marker for pulmonary high-grade neuroendocrine tumors.', 'Neuroendocrine Tumor Heterogeneity Adds Uncertainty to the World Health Organization 2010 Classification: Real-World Data from the Spanish Tumor Registry (R-GETNE).', 'Morphologic and molecular classification of lung neuroendocrine neoplasms.', 'Genomics of High-Grade Neuroendocrine Neoplasms: Well-Differentiated Neuroendocrine Tumor with High-Grade Features (G3 NET) and Neuroendocrine Carcinomas (NEC) of Various Anatomic Sites.', 'The uprise of RNA biology in neuroendocrine neoplasms: altered splicing and RNA species unveil translational opportunities.', 'MEG3 LncRNA from Exosomes Released from Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Enhances Cisplatin Chemoresistance in SCLC via a MiR-15a-5p/CCNE1 Axis.', 'Analysis on the Effects of CT- and Ultrasound-Guided Percutaneous Transthoracic Needle Biopsy Combined with Serum CA125 and CEA on the Diagnosis of Lung Cancer.', ""INSM1, a Novel Biomarker for Detection of Neuroendocrine Neoplasms: Cytopathologists' View."", 'The Role of lncRNAs in Rare Tumors with a Focus on HOX Transcript Antisense RNA (HOTAIR).']"""

In this study, we examine the effectiveness of a therapeutic cancer vaccine that combines the ISCOMATRIX™ adjuvant (ISCOMATRIX) with the Toll-like receptor 3 agonist, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C), and Flt3L, FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand. We employed the TRAMP-C1 (transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate) model of prostate cancer and the self-protein mPAP (prostatic acid phosphatase) as the tumor antigen. ISCOMATRIX™-mPAP-Poly I:C-Flt3L was delivered in a therapeutic prime-boost regime that was consistently able to achieve complete tumor regression in 60% of animals treated and these tumor-free animals were protected upon rechallenge. Investigations into the underlying immunological mechanisms contributing to the effectiveness of this vaccine identified that both innate and adaptive responses are elicited and required. NK cells, CD4+ T cells and interferon-γ were all found to be critical for tumor control while tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells became disabled by an immunosuppressive microenvironment.

Limited evidence suggests that PCA3 is not altered in the presence of inflammation.  Objective:   To assess the impact of histological inflammation on PCA3.  Methods:   PCA3 was evaluated in patients prior to prostate biopsy (n = 193) and to radical prostatectomy (n = 197). In patients without PC, inflammation was assessed and quantified by individual scores integrating grade and extent. Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the impact of inflammation grade on PCA3.  Results:   The PCA3 scores prior to prostatectomy were lower (median 45) than those before positive biopsy (57; p = 0.008). Of 101 negative biopsies, 78% showed inflammation. The median PCA3 scores in the groups with no inflammation and with maximum grade 1 (n = 22), 2 (n = 38), and 3 (n = 19) inflammation were 45, 38, 27, and 25 (p = 0.016). The multivariate models revealed a decrease in PCA3 proportional to the grade and extent of inflammation (p < 0.04 each).  Conclusions:   The present data imply that the PCA3 score decreases in the presence of inflammation, which is relevant, for instance, to testing after a recently performed biopsy. In general, inflammation should be regarded as a factor putatively influencing PCA3 and other available and upcoming PC tests.""","""['Jörg Hennenlotter', 'Tim Neumann', 'Sven Perner', 'Viktoria Wagner', 'Arnulf Stenzl', 'Tilman Todenhöfer', 'Steffen Rausch']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Urol Int""","""['Histological chronic prostatitis and high-grade prostate intra-epithelial neoplasia do not influence urinary prostate cancer gene 3 score.', 'PCA3 molecular urine assay correlates with prostate cancer tumor volume: implication in selecting candidates for active surveillance.', 'Urine TMPRSS2:ERG Plus PCA3 for Individualized Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment.', 'Contemporary role of prostate cancer antigen 3 in the management of prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of diagnostic efficacy by two urine PCA3 scores in prostate cancer patients undergoing repeat biopsies.']"""

Materials and methods:   Eighty-six patients who underwent prostate SBRT (40 Gy in 5 fractions) were included. Patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes were derived from bowel and bladder symptom scores on the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26) at 3 and 12 months post-SBRT. We utilized ensemble machine learning (ML) to interrogate the entire dose-volume histogram (DVH) to evaluate relationships between dose-volume parameters and HRQOL changes. The latent predictive dosimetric parameters that were most associated with HRQOL changes in urinary and rectal function were thus identified. An external cohort of 26 prostate SBRT patients was acquired to further test the predictive models.  Results:   Bladder dose-volume metrics strongly predicted patient-reported urinary irritative and incontinence symptoms (area under the curves [AUCs] of 0.79 and 0.87, respectively) at 12 months. Maximum bladder dose, bladder V102.5%, bladder volume, and conformity indices (V50/VPTV and V100/VPTV) were most predictive of HRQOL changes in both urinary domains. No strong rectal toxicity dosimetric association was identified (AUC = 0.64).  Conclusion:   We demonstrated the application of advanced ML methods to identify a set of dosimetric variables that most highly correlated with patient-reported urinary HRQOL.

This study investigates impact of position uncertainty on error detection thresholds for IVD.  Methods:   IVD is implemented using a microMOSFET placed centrally in the prostate using an additional needle. 144 IVD measurements were made for 15 Gy or 19 Gy single fraction treatments. Needle insertion and treatment planning used real-time trans-rectal ultrasound. Source-MOSFET position thresholds of ±1, ±2 and ±3 mm were used to calculate per-needle and total plan error detection thresholds for the measured dose using an uncertainty analysis based on the treatment plan data.  Results:   The median dose difference from 144 total plan measurements was -5.2% (range +7.4% to -17.3%). 3 plans measured outside the total plan error detection threshold for position threshold ±1 mm, no plans measured outside the total plan error detection threshold for larger position thresholds. For 2233 individual needle measurements, for position thresholds of ±1 mm, ±2mm and ±3 mm the number of needles outside the per-needle error detection threshold was 103, 25 and 10 respectively and the number of treatments that would have required interruption based on these thresholds for real-time IVD was 66, 16 and 8 respectively.  Conclusion:   IVD in HDR prostate brachytherapy using a microMOSFET provides a high level of confidence that we are correctly delivering the planned dose to our patients.

Inhibition of TMPRSS2 may work to block or decrease the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Intriguingly, TMPRSS2 is an androgen-regulated gene that is up-regulated in prostate cancer where it supports tumor progression and is involved in a frequent genetic translocation with the ERG gene. First- or second-generation androgen-deprivation therapies (ADTs) decrease the levels of TMPRSS2. Here we put forward the hypothesis that ADTs may protect patients affected by prostate cancer from SARS-CoV-2 infections.  Materials and methods:   We extracted data regarding 9280 patients (4532 males) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from 68 hospitals in Veneto, one of the Italian regions that was most affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The parameters used for each COVID-19-positive patient were sex, hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit, death, tumor diagnosis, prostate cancer diagnosis, and ADT.  Results:   There were evaluable 9280 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients in Veneto on 1 April 2020. Overall, males developed more severe complications, were more frequently hospitalized, and had a worse clinical outcome than females. Considering only the Veneto male population (2.4 million men), 0.2% and 0.3% of non-cancer and cancer patients, respectively, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Comparing the total number of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases, prostate cancer patients receiving ADT had a significantly lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with patients who did not receive ADT (OR 4.05; 95% CI 1.55-10.59). A greater difference was found comparing prostate cancer patients receiving ADT with patients with any other type of cancer (OR 4.86; 95% CI 1.88-12.56).

Here, we evaluated the association between the inherited HSD3B1 c.1245A>C variant and outcomes from metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) after first-line treatment with abiraterone (Abi) or enzalutamide (Enza).  Patients and methods:   Patients with mCRPC (n = 266) were enrolled from two centers at the time of starting first-line Abi/Enza. Outcomes after Abi/Enza included best prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, treatment duration, and overall survival (OS). Outcomes after first-line ADT were determined retrospectively, and included treatment duration and OS. As was prespecified, we compared patients with the homozygous variant HSD3B1 genotype (CC genotype) versus the combined group with the heterozygous (AC) and homozygous wild-type (AA) genotypes.  Results:   Among the 266 patients, 22 (8.3%) were homozygous for the HSD3B1 variant (CC). The CC genotype had no association with PSA response rate; the median Abi/Enza treatment duration was 7.1 months for the CC group and 10.3 months for the AA/AC group (log rank P = 0.34). Patients with the CC genotype had significantly worse OS, with median survival at 23.6 months for the CC group and 30.7 months for the AA/AC group (log rank P = 0.02). In multivariable analysis adjusting for age, Gleason score, PSA, prior chemotherapy, and M1 disease, the association between the CC genotype and OS remained significant (hazard ratio 1.78, 95% confidence interval 1.03-3.07, P = 0.04). Poor outcome after first-line ADT in the CC group was also observed when evaluating retrospective ADT duration data for the same combined cohort.  Conclusions:   In this large two-center study evaluating the HSD3B1 c.1245 genotype and outcomes after first-line Abi/Enza, homozygous variant (CC) HSD3B1 genotype was associated with worse outcomes.

The aim of this study was to provide a solution to the accuracy-time trade-off for 192Ir-based high-dose-rate brachytherapy by using deep learning.  Methods and materials:   RapidBrachyDL, a 3-dimensional deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model, is proposed to predict dose distributions calculated with the MC method given a patient's computed tomography images, contours of clinical target volume (CTV) and organs at risk, and treatment plan. Sixty-one patients with prostate cancer and 10 patients with cervical cancer were included in this study, with data from 47 patients with prostate cancer being used to train the model.  Results:   Compared with ground truth MC simulations, the predicted dose distributions by RapidBrachyDL showed a consistent shape in the dose-volume histograms (DVHs); comparable DVH dosimetric indices including 0.73% difference for prostate CTV D90, 1.1% for rectum D2cc, 1.45% for urethra D0.1cc, and 1.05% for bladder D2cc; and substantially smaller prediction time, acceleration by a factor of 300. RapidBrachyDL also demonstrated good generalization to cervical data with 1.73%, 2.46%, 1.68%, and 1.74% difference for CTV D90, rectum D2cc, sigmoid D2cc, and bladder D2cc, respectively, which was unseen during the training.  Conclusion:   Deep CNN-based dose estimation is a promising method for patient-specific brachytherapy dosimetry.

A previous pilot study suggested that cranberry capsules may decrease some of the symptoms of acute radiation cystitis. Here we further test their effectiveness in a multicentre double blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial.  Material and methods:   A total of 108 prostate cancer patients were recruited at three New Zealand hospitals between September 2016 and January 2019. Out of this cohort, 101 patients provided datasets for analysis (51 men on cranberry capsules and 50 men on beetroot-containing placebo capsules). Patients took two capsules each morning during RT and for 2 weeks after completion of RT. Three measures were used to assess cystitis severity: modified RTOG, O'Leary interstitial cystitis scale and a sensitive novel radiation induced cystitis assessment scale (RICAS). Cystitis severity was scored at baseline and weekly thereafter during RT and for two weeks after completion of RT. Radiation protocols were stratified to conventional fractionation or hypo-fractionated radiation therapy (CHHiP) to the prostate or radiation to the prostate bed.  Results:   Cranberry capsules performed significantly worse than placebo capsules with respect to day time frequency and bladder control, using the more sensitive RICAS scale. No significant difference in cystitis severity was seen between patients receiving hypofractionation and those receiving conventional fractionation to the prostate gland.  Conclusion:   Cranberry capsules were not superior to beetroot-containing placebo capsules in managing radiation cystitis in our prostate patient cohort. RICAS may be a useful tool for measuring radiation cystitis in future studies.""","""['Patries M Herst', 'Andre Aumata', 'Vanessa Sword', 'Rowan Jones', 'Gordon Purdie', 'Shaun Costello']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Standardized cranberry capsules for radiation cystitis in prostate cancer patients in New Zealand: a randomized double blinded, placebo controlled pilot study.', 'Ultra-hypofractionated versus conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer (HYPO-RT-PC): patient-reported quality-of-life outcomes of a randomised, controlled, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial.', 'Ultra-hypofractionated versus conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: 5-year outcomes of the HYPO-RT-PC randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial.', 'Cranberries for preventing urinary tract infections.', 'Non-surgical interventions for late radiation cystitis in patients who have received radical radiotherapy to the pelvis.', 'The Promising Therapeutic and Preventive Properties of Anthocyanidins/Anthocyanins on Prostate Cancer.', 'Multicentre International Study for the Prevention with iAluRil of Radio-induced Cystitis (MISTIC): A Randomised Controlled Study.', 'Chemical hemorrhagic cystitis: Diagnostic and therapeutic pitfalls (Review).']"""

At sites of PCa bone metastasis, cancer-associated fibroblasts and tumor-associated macrophages interact to establish a perlecan-rich desmoplastic stroma. As a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, perlecan (HSPG2) stores and stabilizes growth factors, including heparin-binding Wnt3A, a positive regulator of PCa cell growth. Because PCa cells alone do not induce CAF production of perlecan in the desmoplastic stroma, we sought to discover the sources of perlecan and its growth factor-releasing modifiers SULF1, SULF2, and heparanase in PCa cells and xenografts, bone marrow fibroblasts, and macrophages. SULF1, produced primarily by bone marrow fibroblasts, was the main glycosaminoglycanase present, a finding validated with primary tissue specimens of PCa metastases with desmoplastic bone stroma. Expression of both HSPG2 and SULF1 was concentrated in αSMA-rich stroma near PCa tumor nests, where infiltrating pro-tumor TAMs also were present. To decipher SULF1's role in the reactive bone stroma, we created a bone marrow biomimetic hydrogel incorporating perlecan, PCa cells, macrophages, and fibroblastic bone marrow stromal cells. Finding that M2-like macrophages increased levels of SULF1 and HSPG2 produced by fibroblasts, we examined SULF1 function in Wnt3A-mediated PCa tumoroid growth in tricultures. Comparing control or SULF1 knockout fibroblastic cells, we showed that SULF1 reduces Wnt3A-driven growth, cellularity, and cluster number of PCa cells in our 3D model. We conclude that SULF1 can suppress Wnt3A-driven growth signals in the desmoplastic stroma of PCa bone metastases, and SULF1 loss favors PCa progression, even in the presence of pro-tumorigenic TAMs.""","""['Fabio Henrique Brasil da Costa', 'Michael S Lewis', 'Anna Truong', 'Daniel D Carson', 'Mary C Farach-Carson']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Transcriptional activation by NFκB increases perlecan/HSPG2 expression in the desmoplastic prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'Matrilysin/MMP-7 Cleavage of Perlecan/HSPG2 Complexed with Semaphorin 3A Supports FAK-Mediated Stromal Invasion by Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Flipping the Molecular Switch: Influence of Perlecan and Its Modifiers in the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Perlecan/HSPG2 and matrilysin/MMP-7 as indices of tissue invasion: tissue localization and circulating perlecan fragments in a cohort of 288 radical prostatectomy patients.', 'The role of tumor microenvironment in prostate cancer bone metastasis.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblasts: The chief architect in the tumor microenvironment.', 'Sulfatase 2 Affects Polarization of M2 Macrophages through the IL-8/JAK2/STAT3 Pathway in Bladder Cancer.', 'Gabapentin Disrupts Binding of Perlecan to the α2δ1 Voltage Sensitive Calcium Channel Subunit and Impairs Skeletal Mechanosensation.', 'The Development of a Gleason Score-Related Gene Signature for Predicting the Prognosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'Bone Marrow Endothelial Cells Increase Prostate Cancer Cell Apoptosis in 3D Triculture Model of Reactive Stroma.']"""

In the prostates of mice with inactivated ERβ, mutant phenotypes include epithelial hyperplasia and increased expression of androgen receptor (AR)-regulated genes, most of which are also upregulated in prostate cancer (PCa). ERβ is expressed in both basal and luminal cells in the prostate while AR is expressed in luminal but not in the basal cell layer which harbors the prostate stem cells. To investigate the mechanisms of action of ERβ and its potential cross-talk with AR, we used RNA-seq to study the effects of estradiol or the synthetic ligand, LY3201, in AR-positive LNCaP PCa cells which had been engineered to express ERβ. Transcriptomic analysis indicated relatively few changes in gene expression with ERβ overexpression, but robust responses following ligand treatments. There is significant overlap of responsive genes between the two ligands, estradiol and LY3201 as well as ligand-specific alterations. Gene set analysis of down-regulated genes identified an enrichment of androgen-responsive genes, such as FKBP5, CAMKK2, and TBC1D4. Consistently, AR transcript, protein levels, and transcriptional activity were down-regulated following ERβ activation. In agreement with this, we find that the phosphorylation of the CAMKK2 target, AMPK, was repressed by ligand-activated ERβ.

Patients and methods:   All queries spontaneously delivered through the WhatsApp instant messaging system commonly used by patients to communicate with oncology units were collected and grouped by homology in five categories. Responses to the queries were given according to recommendations by the Italian Association of Medical Oncology through WhatsApp and by subsequent phone calls. Patients were also classified according to the site of the primary tumor, stage of disease, and current treatments. Analysis of the association between these data and queries was carried out.  Results:   The social scenario in Italy is a nationwide lockdown except for hospitals, pharmacies, and food supplies. Overall, 446 different patients' WhatsApp conversations were analyzed between March 1 and March 13 and comprised the following: requirement of visit delay by patients undergoing oral therapies or in follow-up, delays in chemotherapy or immunotherapy administration, queries about possible immunosuppression, and changes in lifestyle or daily activities. Delay requirements were statistically more frequent among patients with prostate or breast cancer compared with those with lung or pancreatic cancer. Actions taken by oncologists are also reported.

The androgen sensitivity model explains why males are more likely to develop severe symptoms while children are ostensibly resistant to infection. Further, the model explains the difference in COVID-19 mortality rates among different ethnicities. Androgen sensitivity is determined by genetic variants of the androgen receptor. The androgen receptor regulates transcription of the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which is required for SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. TMPRSS2 primes the Spike protein of the virus, which has two consequences: diminishing viral recognition by neutralizing antibodies and activating SARS-CoV-2 for virus-cell fusion. Genetic variants that have been associated with androgenetic alopecia, prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia and polycystic ovary syndrome could be associated with host susceptibility. In addition to theoretical epidemiological and molecular mechanisms, there are reports of high rates of androgenetic alopecia of from hospitalized COVID-19 patients due to severe symptoms. Androgen sensitivity is a likely determinant of COVID-19 disease severity.

Despite advancements in cancer therapies, new therapeutic approaches are still needed for treatment-refractory advanced metastatic PCa. Cross-species analysis presents a robust strategy for the discovery of new potential therapeutic targets. This strategy involves the integration of genomic data from genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) and human PCa datasets. Considering the role of antioxidant pathways in tumor initiation and progression, we searched oxidative stress-related genes for a potential therapeutic target for PCa. First, we analyzed RNA-sequencing data from Pb-Cre4; Ptenf/f mice and discovered an increase in sulfiredoxin (Srxn1) mRNA expression in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), well-differentiated adenocarcinoma (medium-stage tumors), and poor-differentiated adenocarcinoma (advanced-stage prostate tumors). The increase of SRXN1 protein expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry in mouse prostate tumor paraffin samples. Analyses of human databases and prostate tissue microarrays demonstrated that SRXN1 is overexpressed in a subset of high-grade prostate tumors and correlates with aggressive PCa with worse prognosis and decreased survival. Analyses in vitro showed that SRXN1 expression is also higher in most PCa cell lines compared to normal cell lines. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated downregulation of SRXN1 led to decreased viability of PCa cells LNCaP. In conclusion, we identified the antioxidant enzyme SRXN1 as a potential therapeutic target for PCa.

Extraction recovery of plumbagin from albumin in solution showed one-phase exponential decline with a half-live of 9.3 min at 10 μmol/L. In the presence of albumin, plumbagin exhibited instant changes in UV/Vis absorption bands. Electrochemical analysis using cyclic voltammetry showed a decrease in redox peak currents over time until electro-inactivity, thus suggesting the formation of a supramolecular adduct inaccessible for electron transfer. The adduct inhibited cell growth and caused cell-cycle arrest of prostate cancer cells, in part by decreasing levels of the cell-cycle regulator RBBP. The conjugate displayed similar cellular effects to those described for plumbagin, such as decreased levels of androgen receptor and protein kinase C epsilon. The effect of plumbagin-albumin on cancer cells was species-specific, suggesting a receptor-mediated mechanism.

This study seeks to extend previous work by others to the Elekta Agility VMAT treatments commonly used at our clinic. Nine matched pairs of conventional and FFF 6X treatment plans for prostate, head and neck, and brain cancer sites were generated using the Monaco treatment planning system (Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden). Absorbed dose distribution statistics for target and healthy tissue volumes reported by the Monaco treatment planning system were compared. One matched pair of plans for each cancer site was experimentally validated by film and ion chamber measurements in an anthropomorphic phantom. Head leakage was measured at various positions in a small water tank and corrections made to the out-of-field dose distributions calculated by the treatment planning system. Out-of-field organ doses and effective whole body doses were calculated according to ICRP103 (Charles in Radiat Prot Dosim 129:500-507, 2008). The in-field target and organ dose statistics for the cFF and FFF plans were comparable whereas the out-of-field organ and whole body effective doses for plans delivered using 6X FFF were generally lower than those delivered with 6X cFF. A modest increase in monitor unit (MU) delivery rates was also observed with the FFF beams. We conclude that treatment plan delivery using FFF rather than cFF beams is feasible and may provide benefits in terms of reduced out-of-field doses and secondary cancer risks for some patients.""","""['J P Ronaldson', 'H Bennett', 'J Roberts', 'A J Ronaldson', 'A T Cousins']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Phys Eng Sci Med""","""['Re-irradiating spinal column metastases using IMRT and VMAT with and without flattening filter - a treatment planning study.', 'FFF-VMAT for SBRT of lung lesions: Improves dose coverage at tumor-lung interface compared to flattened beams.', 'Radiation-induced second primary cancer risks from modern external beam radiotherapy for early prostate cancer: impact of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and flattening filter free (FFF) radiotherapy.', 'Out-of-field organ doses and associated risk of cancer development following radiation therapy with photons.', 'The evidence base for the use of internal dosimetry in the clinical practice of molecular radiotherapy.', 'Comparison of Moderate Hypofractionated Volumetric-Modulated Arc Therapy Plans With and Without Flattening Filter for Localized Prostate Cancer.']"""

However, STEAP1 lacks an intracellular NADPH-binding domain and does not exhibit cellular ferric reductase activity. Thus, both the molecular function of STEAP1 and its role in cancer progression remain elusive.

High kidney localization has been a problem with radiolabeled LuG derivatives, but has been adequately addressed in radiometal-labeled DOTA-LuG derivatives by linker optimization. Herein, we report an investigation of an alternate approach to diminishing the kidney concentrations of radiolabeled LuG-containing compounds.  Methods:   Our approach involves PEGylated LuG moieties and closo-decaborate (2-) moieties conjugated to streptavidin (SAv) or human serum albumin (HSA). After preparing the LuG conjugates, SAv and HSA conjugates were succinylated to decrease their kidney localization and radioiodinated for evaluation in athymic mice bearing C4-2B osseous PCa tumor xenografts.  Results:   Covalently attaching LuG to succinylated SAv and HSA significantly reduced kidney localization, but unfortunately succinylation resulted in decreased tumor concentrations. In contrast, a potential metabolite [131I]16b, an unconjugated LuG derivative containing a dPEG4® linker, provided tumor concentrations of ~15% ID/g at 4 h pi. A second unconjugated LuG derivative with a similar structure, but containing a dPEG12® linker, [131I]16a had tumor concentrations of ~4%ID/g at 4 h pi. Those results suggest that long PEG linkers also affect tumor localization in a negative manner.  Conclusion:   Conjugation of PEGylated LuG derivatives to proteins can be an effective approach to diminishing kidney localization of radiolabeled LuG reagents, but the protein, linker and the method of linkage need to be further studied. Additionally, modification of the unconjugated 16b to decrease kidney localization may provide PCa targeting agents for use with radiohalogens, including 211At.

We investigated dissection practice patterns and their impact on overall survival using a large national database.  Patients and methods:   Men with prostate adenocarcinoma diagnosed between 2004 and 2013 were identified from the National Cancer Data Base. Disease was classified as either favorable or unfavorable on the basis of National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Minimum follow-up was 4 years. All patients received risk-appropriate surgery: prostatectomy with or without PLND. Prostatectomy alone and prostatectomy with PLND was propensity score matched within each risk cohort. Survival analysis included Kaplan-Meier statistics, Cox proportional hazards model, and multivariate logistic regression.  Results:   A total of 66,469 subjects met the inclusion criteria. Median (range) age was 63 (27-90) years. Median (range) follow-up was 59.53 (48-143.54) months. Within the cohort of patients with favorable risk disease, 51% did not undergo nodal dissection. Matched analysis demonstrated no difference in survival (P = .926). Within the cohort of patients with unfavorable risk disease, 39.2% did not receive nodal dissection. Matched analysis demonstrated that nodal dissection had superior survival (log-rank P = .002; hazard ratio = 0.624; 95% confidence interval, 0.466-0.835; P = .002). Greater odds of receiving nodal dissection included an open or robot-assisted approach compared to a laparoscopic approach, academic/research programs, and higher risk groups.

We investigated whether the African ancestry-specific PCa risk variant at 8q24, rs72725854, is enriched in men with a PCa family history in 9052 cases, 143 cases from high-risk families, and 8595 controls of African ancestry. We found the risk allele to be significantly associated with earlier age at diagnosis, more aggressive disease, and enriched in men with a PCa family history (32% of high-risk familial cases carried the variant vs 23% of cases without a family history and 12% of controls). For cases with two or more first-degree relatives with PCa who had at least one family member diagnosed at age <60 yr, the odds ratios for TA heterozygotes and TT homozygotes were 3.92 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.13-7.22) and 33.41 (95% CI = 10.86-102.84), respectively. Among men with a PCa family history, the absolute risk by age 60 yr reached 21% (95% CI = 17-25%) for TA heterozygotes and 38% (95% CI = 13-65%) for TT homozygotes. We estimate that in men of African ancestry, rs72725854 accounts for 32% of the total familial risk explained by all known PCa risk variants. PATIENT SUMMARY: We found that rs72725854, an African ancestry-specific risk variant, is more common in men with a family history of prostate cancer and in those diagnosed with prostate cancer at younger ages.

To realise the radiobiological advantage of hypofractionation whilst minimising harm, the potential reduction in dose to organs at risk was investigated for biofocused radiotherapy. Patient-specific tumour location and cell density information were derived from multiparametric imaging. Uniform-dose plans and biologically-optimised plans were generated for a standard schedule (78 Gy/39 fractions) and hypofractionated schedules (60 Gy/20 fractions and 36.25 Gy/5 fractions). Results showed that biologically-optimised plans yielded statistically lower doses to the rectum and bladder compared to isoeffective uniform-dose plans for all fractionation schedules. A reduction in the number of fractions increased the target dose modulation required to achieve equal tumour control. On average, biologically-optimised, moderately-hypofractionated plans demonstrated 15.3% (p-value: <0.01) and 23.8% (p-value: 0.02) reduction in rectal and bladder dose compared with standard fractionation. The tissue-sparing effect was more pronounced in extreme hypofractionation with mean reduction in rectal and bladder dose of 43.3% (p-value: < 0.01) and 41.8% (p-value: 0.02), respectively. This study suggests that the ability to utilise patient-specific tumour biology information will provide greater incentive to employ hypofractionation in the treatment of localised prostate cancer with radiotherapy.

In the current study, CD40 DNA methylation was investigated in GC as a novel epigenetic biomarker.  Main methods:   We first analyzed DNA methylation microarrays from the Gene Expression Omnibus database on GC samples to evaluate the potential diagnostic value of CD40 methylation. Moreover, using q-MSP, in a set of internal samples including GC primary tumors and adjacent normal specimens, CD40 DNA methylation levels were determined. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data on GC was also analyzed for further validation.  Key findings:   Our results illustrated significant CD40 hypermethylation in GC samples compared to normal specimens which was significantly correlated with the clinical stage of malignancy. Besides, the high accuracy of CD40 methylation as a diagnostic biomarker in GC was confirmed using the ROC curve analysis with an AUC value of 0.9089. Also, gene set enrichment analysis showed that CD40 is mainly involved in biological processes regulating immune response activation in GC. Further analysis of other prevalent cancer entities in TCGA showed that CD40 hypermethylation is a common event during tumor progression and could be considered as a potential biomarker for the detection of breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers as well.

Despite the efforts of numerous researchers to identify a gene-based therapeutic target as an effective treatment of prostate cancer, there is still a need for further research. The cathepsin gene family is known to have a close correlation with various cancer types and is highly expressed across these cancer types. This study aimed at investigating the correlation between the cathepsin A (CTSA) gene and prostate cancer. Our findings indicated a significantly elevated level of CTSA gene expression in the tissues of patients with prostate cancer when compared with normal prostate tissues. Furthermore, the knockdown of the CTSA gene in the representative prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145 led to reduced proliferation and a marked reduction in anchorage-independent colony formation, which was shown to be caused by cell cycle arrest in the S phase. In addition, CTSA gene-knockdown prostate cancer cell lines showed a substantial decrease in migration and invasion, as well as a decrease in the marker genes that promote epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). Such phenotypic changes in prostate cancer cell lines through CTSA gene suppression were found to be mainly caused by reduced p38 MAPK protein phosphorylation; i.e. the inactivation of the p38 MAPK cell signaling pathway. Tumorigenesis was also found to be inhibited in CTSA gene-knockdown prostate cancer cell lines when a xenograft assay was carried out using Balb/c nude mice, and the p38 MAPK phosphorylation was inhibited in tumor tissues. Thus, the CTSA gene is presumed to play a key role in human prostate cancer tissues through high-level expression, and the suppression of the CTSA gene leads to the inhibition of prostate cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, and metastasis.

The challenge becomes more prevalent when dealing with various types of heterogeneous data. We introduce a systematic, generalized method, called iSOM-GSN, used to transform 'multi-omic' data with higher dimensions onto a 2D grid. Afterwards, we apply a CNN to predict disease states of various types. Based on the idea of Kohonen's self-organizing map, we generate a 2D grid for each sample for a given set of genes that represent a gene similarity network.  Results:   We have tested the model to predict breast and prostate cancer using gene expression, DNA methylation and copy number alteration. Prediction accuracies in the 94-98% range were obtained for tumor stages of breast cancer and calculated Gleason scores of prostate cancer with just 14 input genes for both cases. The scheme not only outputs nearly perfect classification accuracy, but also provides an enhanced scheme for representation learning, visualization, dimensionality reduction and interpretation of multi-omic data.

The risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) and possibly some other malignancies is increased among patients with UC. It is still debated if patients with UC are at a greater risk of dying compared with the general population. Our aim was to describe the epidemiology and mortality of the Hungarian UC population from 2010 to 2016 and to analyze the associated malignancies with a special focus on CRC.  Methods:   This is an observational, descriptive, epidemiological study based on the National Health Insurance Fund social security databases from 2010 to 2016. All adult patients who had at least two events in outpatient care or at least two medication prescriptions, or at least one inpatient event with UC diagnosis were analyzed. Malignancies and CRC were defined using ICD-10 codes. We also evaluated the survival of patients suffering from UC compared with the general population using a 3 to 1 matched random sample (age, gender, geography) from the full population of Hungary.  Results:   We found the annual prevalence of UC 0.24-0.34%. The incidence in 2015 was 21.7/100 000 inhabitants. Annual mortality rate was 0.019-0.023%. In this subpopulation, CRC was the most common cancer, followed by non-melanotic skin and prostate cancer. 8.5% of the UC incident subpopulation was diagnosed with CRC. 470 (33%) of the CRC patients died during the course of the study (25% of all deaths were due to CRC), the median survival was 9.6 years. UC patients had significantly worse survival than their matched controls (HR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.56-1.75).  Summary:   This is the first population-based study from Eastern Europe to estimate the different malignancies and mortality data amongst Hungarian ulcerative colitis patients.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the biological function and regulatory mechanism of lncRNA SOX2 overlapping transcript (SOX2-OT) in prostate cancer (PCa) progression. Materials and Methods: The expression of SOX2-OT, microRNA-452-5p (miR-452-5p), and high mobility group box 3 (HMGB3) was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Flow cytometry was performed to determine the cell cycle distribution. Western blot assay was conducted to measure the protein levels of cyclin D1, p21, p27, E-cadherin, vimentin, and N-cadherin. The interaction between miR-452-5p and SOX2-OT or HMGB3 was predicted by bioinformatics analysis and verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay. The mice xenograft model was established to investigate the role of SOX2-OT in vivo. Results: SOX2-OT and HMGB3 were upregulated, whereas miR-452-5p was downregulated in PCa tissues and cells. Knockdown of SOX2-OT inhibited PCa cell growth and metastasis. MiR-452-5p could directly bind to SOX2-OT and its knockdown reversed the inhibitory effects of SOX2-OT interference on growth and metastasis of PCa cells. HMGB3 was a direct target of miR-452-5p and its knockdown weakened the promotive effects of miR-452-5p silence on growth and metastasis of PCa cells. Moreover, HMGB3 expression was inversely regulated by miR-452-5p and positively modulated by SOX2-OT. Furthermore, SOX2-OT activated the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway through increasing HMGB3 expression. Finally, SOX2-OT knockdown hindered tumor growth in vivo by regulating miR-452-5p/HMGB3 axis. Conclusions: SOX2-OT downregulation limited PCa cell growth and metastasis by regulating miR-452-5p/HMGB3 axis and inactivating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which might offer lncRNA-directed diagnosis and therapy for PCa.""","""['Xiaofei Song', 'Hang Wang', 'Jiawen Wu', 'Yang Sun']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Biother Radiopharm""","""['Downregulation of microRNA-532-5p promotes the proliferation and invasion of bladder cancer cells through promotion of HMGB3/Wnt/β-catenin signaling.', 'Downregulation of lncRNA HOTTIP Suppresses the Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion of Oral Tongue Squamous Cell Carcinoma by Regulation of HMGA2-Mediated Wnt/β-Catenin Pathway.', 'Investigations on the mechanism of progesterone in inhibiting endometrial cancer cell cycle and viability via regulation of long noncoding RNA NEAT1/microRNA-146b-5p mediated Wnt/β-catenin signaling.', 'Non-coding RNA-based therapeutics in cancer therapy: An emphasis on Wnt/β-catenin control.', 'A Concise Review on Dysregulation of LINC00665 in Cancers.', 'Crosstalk between SOX Genes and Long Non-Coding RNAs in Glioblastoma.', 'Importance of long non-coding RNAs in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Novel plasma exosome biomarkers for prostate cancer progression in co-morbid metabolic disease.', 'MicroRNA-452: a double-edged sword in multiple human cancers.', 'The interplay between non-coding RNAs and Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway in urinary tract cancers: from tumorigenesis to metastasis.']"""

Herein, the authors explore the role and molecular mechanism of circRNA SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a, member 5 (circSMARCA5) in PCa. Materials and Methods: The levels of circSMARCA5, SMARCA5, miR-432, and programmed cell death 10 (PDCD10) were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The circular structure and stability of circSMARCA5 were validated by qRT-PCR using Oligo dT primer, transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D, or RNase R treatment, respectively. Cell proliferation, migration, invasion, epithelial/mesenchymal transition (EMT), and glycolysis were detected by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), transwell migration and invasion assays, Western blot assay, and Glucose or Lactate Detection Kit, respectively. The target relationship between miR-432 and circSMARCA5 or PDCD10 was validated by dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. Western blot was performed to detect the protein expression of PDCD10 in PCa cells. Results: CircSMARCA5 was aberrantly upregulated, and was a circular and stable RNA in PCa cells. CircSMARCA5 accelerated the proliferation, metastasis, and glycolysis of PCa cells. MiR-432 was a direct target of circSMARCA5, and circSMARCA5 accelerated the development of PCa through miR-432 in PCa cells. PDCD10 was a direct target of miR-432, and PDCD10 addition reversed the inhibitory effects of miR-432 accumulation on the proliferation, metastasis, and glycolysis of PCa cells. CircSMARCA5 upregulated the expression of PDCD10 through sponging miR-432 in PCa cells. Conclusion: CircSMARCA5 deteriorated PCa through the miR-432/PDCD10 axis.

In this study, we analyzed micro RNA sequences in exosomes released by THP-1 and M2 macrophages and found a significant increase in miR-95 levels in TAM-derived exosomes, demonstrating the direct uptake of miR-95 by recipient PCa cells. In vitro and in vivo loss-of-function assays suggested that miR-95 could function as a tumor promoter by directly binding to its downstream target gene, JunB, to promote PCa cell proliferation, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The clinical data analyses further revealed that higher miR-95 expression results in worse clinicopathological features. Collectively, our results demonstrated that TAM-mediated PCa progression is partially attributed to the aberrant expression of miR-95 in TAM-derived exosomes, and the miR-95/JunB axis provides the groundwork for research on TAMs to further develop more-personalized therapeutic approaches for patients with PCa.""","""['Han Guan', 'Rui Peng', 'Fang Fang', 'Likai Mao', 'Zhijun Chen', 'Shuai Yang', 'Changyuan Dai', 'Hongliang Wu', 'Chengyong Wang', 'Ninghan Feng', 'Bin Xu', 'Ming Chen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Cell Physiol""","""['Snail-overexpressing Cancer Cells Promote M2-Like Polarization of Tumor-Associated Macrophages by Delivering MiR-21-Abundant Exosomes.', 'Loss of exosomal miR-148b from cancer-associated fibroblasts promotes endometrial cancer cell invasion and cancer metastasis.', 'A novel microRNA regulator of prostate cancer epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'Tumor-derived exosomal microRNAs and proteins as modulators of macrophage function.', 'The role of CAF derived exosomal microRNAs in the tumour microenvironment of melanoma.', 'ZIC2 induces pro-tumor macrophage polarization in nasopharyngeal carcinoma by activating the JUNB/MCSF axis.', 'Role of microRNA carried by small extracellular vesicles in urological tumors.', 'Advances in landscape and related therapeutic targets of the prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'Epigenetic regulation and therapeutic targets in the tumor microenvironment.', 'Smoking-Induced M2-TAMs, via circEML4 in EVs, Promote the Progression of NSCLC through ALKBH5-Regulated m6A Modification of SOCS2 in NSCLC Cells.']"""

To study transcript partitioning under cell stress, we catalogued mRNAs enriched in prostate carcinoma PC-3 cell PSs, as defined by polysome fractionation and RNA sequencing (RNAseq), and compared them to mRNAs complexed with the known SG-nucleator protein, G3BP1, as defined by spatially-restricted enzymatic tagging and RNAseq. By comparing these compartments before and after short-term arsenite-induced oxidative stress, we identified three major categories of transcripts, namely those that were G3BP1-associated and PS-depleted, G3BP1-dissociated and PS-enriched, and G3BP1-associated but also PS-enriched. Oxidative stress profoundly altered the partitioning of transcripts between these compartments. Under arsenite stress, G3BP1-associated and PS-depleted transcripts correlated with reduced expression of encoded mitochondrial proteins, PS-enriched transcripts that disassociated from G3BP1 encoded cell cycle and cytoprotective proteins whose expression increased, while transcripts that were both G3BP1-associated and PS-enriched encoded proteins involved in diverse stress response pathways.

The outcomes of interest were mortality from cancers of the esophagus, stomach, intestine, rectum, bladder, liver, pancreas, larynx, lung, skin, prostate, brain, and female breast, as well as leukemia. This report includes 5472 deaths from cancer, more than ten times the numbers of deaths in our last summary report published 20 years ago. Methods Standardized mortality ratios were computed for the entire study period. Adjusted hazard ratios (HR) were estimated in Cox proportional hazard models with categorical variables for cumulative exposure to each type of MWF. Results Exposure-response patterns are consistent with prior mortality reports from this cohort. We found increased risk of skin and female breast cancer with straight fluids. For the first time, we found elevated risk of stomach cancer mortality. Overall, many of the exposure-response results did not suggest an association with MWF. Conclusions Mortality is a poor proxy for cancer diagnosis for treatable cancers and not the optimal outcome measure in etiological studies. Although the HR presented here handle bias from the healthy worker hire effect and left truncation, they do not handle bias from healthy worker survivor effect, which likely results in underestimates of the health impacts of MWF.

Materials and methods:   Data was extracted from the nationwide Iranian cancer registry system during 2008-2010. Pathologies and grade was extracted from scanned reports of patients' pathologies by a urologist.  Results:   The average 3-year age standardized incidence rate of prostate cancer during the study period was 11.52 per 100000 males. The age standardized incidence rates for Persian, Arab, Turkish and Turkmen, Lor, Kurd and Baluch ethnicities were 13.5, 9.3, 7.9, 7.9, 7.2 and 2.1 per 100000, respectively. Poisson regression analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in incidence of prostate cancer in Baluch ethnicity (P=0.028) and a near significant difference for incidence of prostate cancer in Turk-Turkmen and Kurd ethnicity (P=0.067 and P=0.082) in comparison with Persian ethnicity. The median Gleason score distribution of prostate cancer was not concordant to the age standardized incidence rates. 97% of all pathologies were adenocarcinoma of the prostate followed by malignant carcinoma (1.9%), and transitional cell carcinoma (1.1%).  Conclusion:   The incidence of Prostate cancer was different between Baluch and Fars ethnicities in Iran. The lowest ASR of PCa was observed in Baluch ethnicity, however the possibility of underreporting due to less access in Baluch ethnicity cannot be ruled out. The Gleason distribution pattern was not concordant to the incidence distribution of Prostate cancer.""","""['Abbas Basiri', 'Babak Eshrati', 'Ali Zarehoroki', 'Shabnam Golshan', 'Nasser Shakhssalim', 'Alireza Khoshdel', 'Amir Hossein Kashi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Urol J""","""['Prostate Cancer in Iran: Trends in Incidence and Morphological and Epidemiological Characteristics.', 'Static anthropometric dimensions in a population of Iranian high school students: considering ethnic differences.', 'SOCS3 Immunohistochemical Expression Seems to Support the 2005 and 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Modified Gleason Grading System.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.', 'Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in the treatment of patients with clinically high-risk localized and locally advanced prostate cancer: single surgeons functional and oncologic outcomes.']"""

Methods:   From June 2009 to December 2017, we enrolled in this study 735 ER-positive BC patients (stage pT1-T2, pNx-1, M0 and age ≥ 65 years) receiving hypo-RT and followed them until September 2019. Baseline comorbidities included in the hypertension-augmented Charlson Comorbidity Index were retrospectively retrieved. Logistic regression model estimated adjusted-odds ratios (ORs) of ET prescription in relation to baseline patient and tumor characteristics. Competing risk analysis estimated 5-year cumulative incidence function (CIF) of ET discontinuation due to side effects (with BC progression or death as competing events), and its effect on locoregional recurrence (LRR) and distant metastasis (DM) (with death as competing event).  Results:   ET has been prescribed in 89% patients. In multivariable analysis, the odds of ET prescription was significantly reduced in older patients (≥ 80 years, OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.03-0.20) and significantly increased in patients with moderate comorbidity. Patients ≥ 80 years discontinued the prescribed therapy earlier and more frequently than younger (65-69 years) patients (p = 0.060). Five-year CIF of LLR, DM and death from causes other that BC were 1.7%, 2.2% and 7.5%, respectively. Patients who discontinued ET had higher chance of LRR (p = 0.004).

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) allows the detection of oligometastatic disease that may be amenable to image-guided radiotherapy. The current study classifies the type and localization of metastases and the clinical outcome of PSMA-PET/CT-guided radiotherapy to selected metastases.  Materials and methods:   Between 2011 and 2019, 86 patients with recurrent, oligometastatic prostate carcinoma were identified by PSMA-PET/CT and were treated with image-guided radiotherapy of their metastases. Sites of relapse were characterized, and the primary endpoint overall survival (OS), biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS), and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)-free survival were tabulated.  Results:   In total, 37% of the metastases were bone metastases, 48% were pelvic nodal metastases, and 15% were nodal metastases outside of the pelvis. After PSMA-guided radiotherapy, a biochemical response was detected in 83% of the cohort. A statistically significant decrease in the standard uptake value (SUV) was seen in irradiated metastases. After a median follow-up of 26 months, the 3-year OS and bPFS were 84% and 55%, respectively. The median time of ADT-free survival was 13.5 months. A better clinical outcome was observed for patients receiving concomitant ADT or more than 24 fractions of radiation.

Previously, the ERA 223 trial (NCT02043678) demonstrated increased fracture risk with concurrent treatment with radium-223 and abiraterone plus prednisone/prednisolone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Methods:   We used the Flatiron Health database to perform a retrospective study of patients with mCRPC treated with radium-223.

Methods:   Following dissemination of imaging guidelines within the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC) for men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer, MUSIC set a target of imaging < 10% of patients for which bone scan is not indicated. We compared four SPC methods using Monte Carlo simulation: p-chart, weighted binomial CUSUM, Bernoulli cumulative sum (CUSUM), and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA). We simulated non-indicated bone scan rates ranging from 5.9% (within target) to 11.4% (above target) for a representative MUSIC practice. Sensitivity was determined using the average run length (ARL), the time taken to signal a change. We then plotted actual non-indicated bone scan rates for a representative MUSIC practice using each SPC method to qualitatively assess graphical interpretation.  Results:   EWMA had the lowest ARL and was able to detect changes significantly earlier than the other SPC methodologies (p < 0.001). The p-chart had the highest ARL and thus detected changes slowest (p < 0.001). EWMA and p-charts were easier to interpret graphically than CUSUM methods due to their ability to display historical imaging rates.

The synthesized compounds exhibited a Warburg effect mediated selectivity to human prostate cancer cells (including highly drug-resistant cell lines). Mitochondria were identified as a primary cellular target of SABs. The mechanism of action included mitochondria membrane permeabilization, followed by ROS upregulation and release of cytotoxic mitochondrial proteins (AIF and cytochrome C) to the cytoplasm, which led to the consequent caspase-9 and -3 activation, PARP cleavage, and apoptosis-like cell death.

Previously, we found that Bic selectively damaged mesangial cells compared to tubular cells and in an in vivo rat model, we also found renal damage caused by Bic. In the present study, a rat mesangial cell model was used to further the investigation. Results indicated that Bic enhanced lactate dehydrogenase release, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, lysosome population and kidney injury molecule-1 and decreased N-cadherin. Bic elicited mitochondrial swelling and reduced the mitochondrial potential, resulting in severe suppression of the oxygen consumption rate (OCR), maximum respiration and ATP production. The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 transcriptional activity and messenger RNA were significantly upregulated in dose-dependent manners. The HIF-1 protein reached a peak value at 24 h then rapidly decayed. BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa protein-interacting protein 3 and cleaved caspase-3 were dose-dependently upregulated by Bic (60 M) and that eventually led to cell apoptosis.

Recent reports indicated that monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) levels elevate in PCa, and antidepressant MAO-Is show anti-PCa properties. In this work, we aimed to find potential drugs for PCa patients suffering from depression by establishing novel anti-PCa reversible monoamine oxidase-A inhibitors (MAO-AIs/RIMA); with an endeavor to understand their mechanism of action. In this investigation, twenty synthesized flavonoid derivatives, defined as KKR compounds were screened for their inhibitory potentials against human MAO-A and MAO-B isozymes. Meanwhile, the cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects were determined in three human PCa cell lines. MAO-A-kinetics, molecular docking, SAR, cell morphology, and cell migration were investigated for the most potent compounds. The screened KKRs inhibited MAO-A more potently than MAO-B, and non-toxically inhibited LNCaP cell proliferation more than the DU145 and PC3 cell lines, respectively. The results showed that the three top MAO-AI KKRs compounds (KKR11, KKR20, and KKR7 (IC50s 0.02-16 μM) overlapped with the top six antiproliferative KKRs against LNCaP (IC50s ~9.4 μM). While KKR21 (MAO-AI) and KKR2A (MAO-I) were ineffective against the PCa cells. Furthermore, KKR21 and KKR11 inhibited MAO-A competitively (Kis ≤ 7.4 nM). Molecular docking of the two compounds predicted shared hydrophobic and distinctive hydrophilic interactions-between the KKR molecule and MAO-A amino acid residues-to be responsible for their reversibility. The combined results and SAR observations indicated that the presence of specific active groups-such as chlorine and hydroxyl groups-are essential in certain MAO-AIs with anti-PCa effects. Additionally, MAO-A inhibition was found to be associated more with anti-PCa property than MAO-B. Distinctively, KKR11 [(E)-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-(2-hydroxy-4,6-dimethoxyphenyl)prop-2-en-1-one] exhibited anti-metastatic effects on the DU145 cell line. The chlorine substitution groups might play vital roles in the KKR11 multiple actions.

Importantly, our recent work examining metastatic biopsy samples demonstrates NEPC is increasing in frequency. In contrast to prostate adenocarcinomas that express a luminal gene expression program, NEPC tumors express a neuronal gene expression program. Despite this distinction, the diagnosis of NEPC is often challenging, demonstrating an urgent need to identify new biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Our prior work demonstrated that the histone demethylase LSD1 (KDM1A) is important for survival of prostate adenocarcinomas, but little was known about LSD1's role in NEPC. Recently, a neural-specific transcript variant of LSD1-LSD1+8a-was discovered and demonstrated to activate neuronal gene expression in neural cells. The splicing factor SRRM4 was previously shown to promote LSD1+8a splicing in neuronal cells, and SRRM4 promotes NEPC differentiation and cell survival. Therefore, we sought to determine if LSD1+8a might play a role in NEPC and whether LSD1+8a splicing was linked to SRRM4. To investigate a potential role for LSD1+8a in NEPC, we examined a panel of prostate adenocarcinoma and NEPC patient-derived xenografts and metastatic biopsies. LSD1+8a was expressed exclusively in NEPC samples and correlated significantly with elevated expression of SRRM4. Using SRRM4-overexpressing cell lines, we determined that SRRM4 mediates alternative splicing of LSD1+8a. Finally, using gain of function studies, we confirmed that LSD1+8a and SRRM4 co-regulate target genes distinct from canonical LSD1. Our findings suggest further study of the interplay between SRRM4 and LSD1+8a and mechanisms by which LSD1+8a regulates gene expression in NEPC is warranted.""","""['Daniel J Coleman', 'David A Sampson', 'Archana Sehrawat', 'Anbarasu Kumaraswamy', 'Duanchen Sun', 'Yuzhuo Wang', 'Jacob Schwartzman', 'Joshua Urrutia', 'Ahn R Lee', 'Ilsa M Coleman', 'Peter S Nelson', 'Xuesen Dong', 'Colm Morrissey', 'Eva Corey', 'Zheng Xia', 'Joel A Yates', 'Joshi J Alumkal']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['SRRM4 Drives Neuroendocrine Transdifferentiation of Prostate Adenocarcinoma Under Androgen Receptor Pathway Inhibition.', 'A novel mechanism of SRRM4 in promoting neuroendocrine prostate cancer development via a pluripotency gene network.', 'RNA Splicing of the BHC80 Gene Contributes to Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'The role of epigenetics and long noncoding RNA MIAT in neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'RNA splicing and splicing regulator changes in prostate cancer pathology.', 'Lineage plasticity and treatment resistance in prostate cancer: the intersection of genetics, epigenetics, and evolution.', 'An antisense amido-bridged nucleic acid gapmer oligonucleotide targeting SRRM4 alters REST splicing and exhibits anti-tumor effects in small cell lung cancer and prostate cancer cells.', 'Phenotypic Plasticity - Alternate Transcriptional Programs Driving Treatment Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'The Role of Epigenetic Change in Therapy-Induced Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer Lineage Plasticity.', 'Immunotherapeutic Significance of a Prognostic Alternative Splicing Signature in Bladder Cancer.']"""

Methods:   A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from a societal perspective using a Markov model to compare 2 strategies: the population-based screening strategy and the current clinical diagnostic strategy. Relevant parameters were retrieved from published literature data and surveys, and univariate sensitivity analysis was used to assess the robustness of the model. We simulated the health outcomes for the next 25 years for 100 000 men and calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).  Results:   This study found that the population-based screening strategy, compared with the clinical diagnostic strategy, could save 756.61 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for the hypothetical population. The ICER for the population-based screening strategy was ¥14 747.11/QALY, and this value was less than the willingness-to-pay threshold of ¥64 520. With life-year gains (LYGs) as the model output, the population-based screening strategy yielded an ICER of ¥16 470.45/LYG. The univariate sensitivity analyses showed that the ICER was sensitive to the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test fee, the proportion diagnosed with low-grade prostate cancer (PC) in the population-based strategy, and the proportion diagnosed with intermediate-grade PC in the population-based strategy.  Conclusions:   Prostate cancer screening based on PSA test results appears to be cost-effective for Chinese men who are in good health and have a life expectancy of more than 10 years. Nevertheless, this finding needs to be further studied with more treatment cost parameters (treatment costs related to impotence and urinary incontinence) and using local utility value information.""","""['Guoqiang Zhao', 'Yuchen Shao', 'Nan Zhang', 'Jialin Wang', 'Linlin Yuan', 'Xiaojie Sun', 'Lizheng Shi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Value Health Reg Issues""","""['The cost-effectiveness of prostate health index for prostate cancer detection in Chinese men.', 'Cost-effectiveness of Prostate Health Index for prostate cancer detection.', 'A Cost-Utility Analysis of Prostate Cancer Screening in Australia.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA)-Based Population Screening for Prostate Cancer: An Economic Analysis.', 'Cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer screening: a systematic review of decision-analytical models.', 'China county-based prostate specific antigen screening for prostate cancer and a cost-effective analysis.']"""

Methods and materials:   Patients (n = 69) with prostate cancer who had pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for low-dose-rate brachytherapy treatment planning were included. Three radiologists independently assessed the visibility of nine anatomic structures on each sequence by using a 5-point scale and overall image quality by using a 4-point scale. The significance of the differences in diagnostic performance was tested with a Wilcoxon signed rank test.  Results:   No significant intersequence differences were found for most (7/9) anatomical structures and overall image quality. The mean scores for visibility of anatomical structures on the 3D SPACE and 2D TSE sequences, respectively, were as follows: the zonal anatomy (3.7; 3.9, p = 0.05), prostate capsule (3.9; 4.0, p = 0.08), neurovascular bundle (2.9; 2.9, p = 0.9), rectoprostatic angle (3.8; 3.8, p = 0.35), rectum (4.2; 4.3, p = 0.26), urethra (3.8; 3.9, p = 0.12), urinary bladder (4.6; 4.6, p = 0.61), and overall image quality (2.9; 2.9, p = 0.33). 3D SPACE was superior for delineation of the genitourinary diaphragm (3.8; 3.6, p = 0.003), whereas 2D TSE was superior for delineation of the seminal vesicles (3.5; 4.0, p < 0.0001).  Conclusions:   Anatomic delineation of the prostatic and periprostatic anatomy provided by the 3D SPACE sequence is as robust in quality as that provided by a conventional 2D TSE sequence with superior delineation of the genitourinary diaphragm.

Patients and methods:   Thirty-five patients with localized prostate cancer were enrolled for transvesical RARP. The patients' preoperative data (mean ± sd age 63.4 ± 8.1 years, body mass index 28.6 ± 5.3 kg/m2 , total prostate-specific antigen 10.8 ± 4.9 ng/mL and prostate volume 30.6 ± 14.4 mL, and median [interquartile range {IQR}] biopsy Gleason score 6 [6-7], and International Index of Erectile Function [IIEF]-5 score 18 [16-20]) were collected. Preoperative assessment revealed 28 cases of cT2a and seven cases of cT2b disease. All patients were continent preoperatively (defined as no pad required or one dry pad per day as a precaution). Surgical results and peri-operative complications were assessed. All patients were followed up for at least 12 months postoperatively.  Results:   The mean operating time was 150 ± 35 min. Estimated blood loss was 100 ± 45 mL. Urinary infection was noted in one patient and managed with levofloxacin. Another patient complained of nocturia on postoperative day 14, which was relieved with solifenacin succinate. Urethral catheters were removed on postoperative day 7. Thirty-two patients achieved immediate urinary continence, with three patients returning to full continence on postoperative day 14. Postoperative pathology confirmed 24 pT2a cases, nine pT2b cases and two pT2c cases (median [IQR] Gleason score 6 [6-7]). Positive surgical margins were found in four patients (11.4%). No urethral stricture or urinary leakage was noted on urethrocystography taken 3 months after surgery. Urodynamic studies were performed preoperatively and 6 months after surgery: median (IQR) maximum urinary flow 12.2 (10.2-14.9) vs 13.7 (10.1-15.0) mL/s; bladder capacity 385.3 (351.3-410.2) vs 370.2 (330.1-395.4) mL; and voiding phase detrusor contractility 38.5 (27.8-42.3) vs 35.6 (28.3-41.3) mmH2 O, respectively. During a minimum of 12 months of follow-up, no biochemical recurrence was noted in any patient. The median (IQR) IIEF-5 score was 17 (16-19).

Nevertheless, the clinical potential of AKIP1 during the development of cervical cancer (CC) remains unclear. A series of experiments involving BdU, colony formation, wound healing and cell invasion assays were performed to determine cell proliferation, migration and invasion, respectively. Gene expression changes were validated by qRT-PCR, Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. We found that AKIP1 expression is increased in CC cell lines and tissue specimens from CC patients. The elevated AKIP1 expression in primary tumours was related to lymph node metastasis in CC patients. In addition, we observed that overexpression of AKIP1 promotes CC cell proliferation. Enhanced expression of AKIP1 facilitated the migration and invasion of CC cells by inducing NF-κB-dependent epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, mechanistic investigations revealed that AKIP1 induced nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of the p65 NF-κB subunit through the PI3K/Akt/IKKβ pathway. Conversely, enhanced expression of phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) inhibited this signalling pathway and restored an epithelial phenotype to CC cells in the presence of overexpressed AKIP1. Our results indicate that AKIP1 promotes the EMT and metastasis in CC by activating NF-κB signalling through the PI3K/Akt/IKKβ pathway, suggesting that AKIP1 could be a pivotal regulator of an EMT axis in CC. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: AKIP1 expression in the samples of CC patients and in in vitro tumour cell lines provides evidence that expression of AKIP1 in CC contributes to cancer progression. Our findings indicate that AKIP1 promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis in CC by activating NF-κB signalling through the PI3K/Akt/IKKβ pathway, suggesting that AKIP1 is a pivotal regulator of an EMT axis in CC.

The optimized NiOx membrane with oxygen content of 4 sccm on planar SiOx/Si substrate shows good pH sensitivity of approximately 50 mV/pH, low hysteresis of 3.4 mV, and low drift rate of 2.4 mV/h as compared to other oxygen content membranes of 1, 10, and 15 sccm. Further, uric acid with the concentration of 0.1 μM is detected directly by using the optimized NiOx membrane. In addition, repeatable H2O2 sensing with the low concentration of 10 pM as well as prostate cancer biomarker is detected, which is owing to the reduction-oxidation phenomena of the NiOx membranes. The sensing mechanism is owing to the Ni2+/Ni3+ oxidation states of the NiOx membrane, which is confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The optimized NiOx membrane on vertical Si nanowire in the EIN structure shows a good drift rate of 3.84 mV/h and sarcosine detection with improvement of approximately 1000 times as compared to the planar Si in an electrolyte-insulator-semiconductor (EIS) structure.

Punicic acid, the polyunsaturated fatty acid of pomegranate seed oil, has been shown to possess anti-cancer effects on prostate cancer and the study also covers recent patents related to prostate cancer. The objective of the current study was to synthesize a co-polymeric micelle for delivery of Flutamide (FL) in prostate cancer using Polyacrylamide (PAM) and Punicic Acid (PA).  Methods:   The co-polymer of PAM and PA was synthesized and conjugated to folic acid. The successful conjugation was studied computationally by the density functional theory method and was confirmed by the FT- IR and 1HNMR. The folate-PAMPA micelles produced by the film casting method were characterized physically. FL was loaded in the nanomicelles and its release test was done at different pH. The Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) was measured by pyrene as a fluorescent probe. Their cellular uptake and cytotoxicity were evaluated on PC3 prostate cancer cells. The molecular geometry and vibrational frequencies of two different possibilities for conjugation were calculated using the B3LYP/6-31G basis set.  Results:   The CMC of the micelles and their particle size were 79.05 μg/ml and 88 nm, respectively. The resulting nanocarriers of FL showed significantly more cytotoxic effects than the free drug at a concentration of 25 μM. The calculated results showed that the optimized geometries could well reproduce the structural parameters, and the theoretical vibrational frequencies were in good agreement with the experimental values.  Conclusion:   Folate-PAMPA nanomicelles may be promising for the enhancement of FL cytotoxicity and seem to potentiate the effect of chemotherapeutic agents used in prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Razieh Mirsafaei', 'Jaleh Varshosaz', 'Seyed N Mirsattari']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Recent Pat Nanotechnol""","""['Punicic Acid and Its Role in the Prevention of Neurological Disorders: A Review.', 'Polyacrylamide-punicic acid conjugate-based micelles for flutamide delivery in PC3 cells of prostate cancer: synthesis, characterisation and cytotoxicity studies.', 'Uptake of etoposide in CT-26 cells of colorectal cancer using folate targeted dextran stearate polymeric micelles.', 'Enhanced delivery system of flutamide loaded chitosan-dextran sulphate nanoparticles for prostate cancer.', '9-NC-loaded folate-conjugated polymer micelles as tumor targeted drug delivery system: preparation and evaluation in vitro.', 'Punicic Acid and Its Role in the Prevention of Neurological Disorders: A Review.']"""

Aspirin may decrease VTE in the general population without significant bleeding. Here, we examined whether aspirin is associated with reduced rates of VTE in older patients with cancer.  Methods and results:   Using the National Inpatient Sample 2016, we retrospectively identified a cohort of patients with cancer ≥65 years old who received aspirin and a similar cohort who did not receive aspirin (n = 31 654, each). The cohorts were matched for age, sex, race, patient demographics, insurance, hospital demographics, and 9 comorbidities (smoking, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, and history of deep venous thrombosis [DVT]/pulmonary embolism [PE]). Primary outcomes were discharge diagnosis of acute PE or acute DVT. Secondary outcomes were inhospital mortality, bleeding, length of hospital stay (LOS), and total hospitalization cost. The aspirin group, compared with the nonaspirin group, had a significantly lower incidence of acute PE (matched, 2.1% vs 2.6%, P < .001), acute DVT (matched, 2.3% vs 3.2%, P < .001), and inhospital mortality (matched 4.0% vs 6.5%, P < .001); shorter LOS (matched, 5.29 ± 5.01 vs 6.20 ± 6.56 days, P < .001); and lower total costs (matched, US$14 700 ± 15 031 vs US$16 363 ± 20 219, P < .001). The primary and secondary outcomes were similar before and after propensity matching. We found no increase in bleeding in the aspirin group compared to the nonaspirin group: gastrointestinal bleeding (matched, 3.8% vs 4.0%, P= .168), hematuria (matched, 3.5% vs 3.7%, P = .102), hemoptysis (matched, 0.9% vs 0.9%, P = .532), and hemorrhagic stroke (matched, 0.8% vs 0.8%, P = .443).

We evaluated the effects of AP/AC therapy and tested the hypothesis that platelet count may also be associated with outcomes.  Methods:   A total of 482 patients received primary radiotherapy (median dose 72 Gy) for nonmetastatic prostate cancer; 49% received androgen deprivation therapy. NCCN risk was low/intermediate/high risk in 39%/39%/22%. AP/AC therapy and platelet counts were analyzed with respect to freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF, nadir+2), distant metastasis (FFDM), and cause specific survival (CSS).  Results:   After a median follow-up of 103 months, 10-year FFBF, FFDM, and CSS were 77%, 92%, and 96%, respectively. The 10-year cumulative incidence of BF and DM (with death as a competing event) was 19% and 7.0%, respectively. The 32% of men on AP/AC therapy had a lower incidence of 10-year BF (P = .016) and a trend toward a lower incidence of DM (P = .084) and CSS (P = .091). In the entire cohort, lowest platelet quartile (platelet count <187) was associated with higher 10-year BF (31% vs 16%, P = .0042) but not DM (9.4% vs 5.2%, P = .22) nor CSS (P = .76) compared with those patients with platelet count ≥187. AP/AC therapy was associated with a larger absolute reduction in BF for men with lowest platelet quartile (10-year BF of 21% vs 38%, P = .092) vs platelet ≥187 (10-year BF of 10% vs 18%, P = .053). Lowest platelet quartile remained associated with higher BF and DM on multivariable analysis controlling for risk category, WBC, and Hg.  Conclusion:   AP/AC was associated with improved FFBF. Low platelet count was associated with inferior FFBF and FFDM after prostate radiotherapy.

This new complex has a high capacity to inhibit the proliferation of prostate cancer cells (IC50 = 1.92 μg/ml). This activity could be attributed to its ability to induce mitochondrial fragmentation through increasing mitochondrial fission dynamin-related protein 1 (p < .05) and down-regulation of optic atrophy 1 proteins (p < .05). Moreover, this complex can effectively disrupt ATP synthase action leading to declined ATP production, along with downstream of ATPase inhibitor factor1 that hinder energy production in the cancer cells. Also, it has an anti-inflammatory effect by triggering modulators for the release of inflammatory molecules such as TNF-α (p < .05), IL-6 (p < .05), and mRNA transcripts of COX-II (p < .01). Therefore, Pd(II)COS@GbA exhibited significant anti-prostate cancer activity through different mechanisms in inducing energy depletion and mitochondrial fragmentation leading to disrupted oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Complex Pd(II)COS@GbA is more cytotoxic for PC3 than RWPE-1 which in turn means it is may act as a selective cytotoxic agent for prostate cancer.""","""['Serag Eldin I Elbehairi', 'Mohammad Y Alfaifi', 'Ali A Shati', 'Mohammed A Alshehri', 'Reda F M Elshaarawy', 'Hani S Hafez']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Chem Biol Drug Des""","""['Energy Metabolism Drugs Block Triple Negative Breast Metastatic Cancer Cell Phenotype.', 'Gboxin is an oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor that targets glioblastoma.', 'Chitooligosaccharides display anti-tumor effects against human cervical cancer cells via the apoptotic and autophagic pathways.', 'The impact of chitooligosaccharides and their derivatives on the in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity: A comprehensive review.', 'Therapeutic potential of targeting mitochondrial dynamics in cancer.', 'Unraveling the Peculiar Features of Mitochondrial Metabolism and Dynamics in Prostate Cancer.', 'Defueling the cancer: ATP synthase as an emerging target in cancer therapy.', 'Long Non-coding RNAs Involved in Metabolic Alterations in Breast and Prostate Cancers.', 'Opa1 Reduces Hypoxia-Induced Cardiomyocyte Death by Improving Mitochondrial Quality Control.']"""

Patients and methods:   Thirty-two patients with oligorecurrent relapse after curative therapy received a first PSMA PET-directed RT of all metastases. After biochemical progression, all patients received a second PSMA PET-directed RT of all metastases. The main outcome parameters were biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS) and androgen deprivation therapy-free survival (ADT-FS). The intervals of BPFS were analyzed separately as follows: the interval from the last day of PSMA PET-directed RT to the first biochemical progression was defined as bPFS_1 and the interval from second PSMA PET-directed RT to further biochemical progression was defined as bPFS_2.  Results:   The median follow-up duration was 39.5 months (18-60). One out of 32 (3.1%) patients died after 47 months of progressive metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa). All patients showed biochemical responses after the first PSMA PET-directed RT and the median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level before RT was 1.70 ng/mL (0.2-3.8), which decreased significantly to a median PSA nadir level of 0.39 ng/mL (range <0.07-3.8; p = 0.004). The median PSA level at biochemical progression after the first PSMA PET-directed RT was 2.9 ng/mL (range 0.12-12.80; p = 0.24). Furthermore, the PSA level after the second PSMA PET-directed RT at the last follow-up (0.52 ng/mL, range <0.07-154.0) was not significantly different (p = 0.36) from the median PSA level (1.70 ng/mL, range 0.2-3.8) before the first PSMA PET-directed RT. The median bPFS_1 was 16.0 months after the first PSMA PET-directed RT (95% CI 11.9-19.2) and the median bPFS_2 was significantly shorter at 8.0 months (95% CI 6.3-17.7) after the second PSMA PET-directed RT (p = 0.03; 95% CI 1.9-8.3).

The aim of the present retrospective study was to report the preliminary clinical results and toxicity of a mono-institutional series of patients re-irradiated with linac-based SBRT in recurrent prostate cancer.  Methods:   Inclusion criteria were previous definitive or adjuvant/salvage RT, evidence of biochemical recurrence and radiological detection of local relapse (Magnetic Resonance Imaging or PSMA/choline-Positron Emission Tomography), and IPSS <10. Toxicity was assessed according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0.  Results:   Between 12/2014 and 12/2019, 24 patients with median age 75 years (65-89) underwent re-RT for PC recurrence. Median follow-up was 21 months (2-68). The recurrences occurred in 13 cases within the prostate and in 11 cases within the prostate bed. All patients were treated with SBRT to a median total dose of 30 Gy (25-36 Gy) in 5-6 fractions, and simultaneous androgen deprivation therapy was administered in 4 patients. Acute toxicity was G1 in 8.3% and G2 in 12.5% for genitourinary (GU), no acute gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity occurred. Concerning late side effects, 19.7% of patients were found to have ≥G2 GU toxicity, including one G3 urethral stenosis. Only one case of G1 late GI toxicity occurred and no ≥G2.

The aim of the study was to assess the use of antibiotic prophylaxis for prostate biopsy in Sweden. Methods: All public and private urology clinics reporting to the National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden received a survey on TRUS-biopsy prophylaxis. Results: Of the 84 clinics surveyed, 76 replied (90%). If no risk factors for infection were present, a single dose of ciprofloxacin 750 mg was used by 50 clinics (66%). Multiple doses of ciprofloxacin 500 or 750 mg (n=14; 18%) or a single dose of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg (n=7; 9%) were other common prophylaxes. Most clinics gave the prophylaxes immediately before the biopsy (n=41; 54%). Urine dipstick was used by 30 clinics (39%) and rectal enema by six (8%). In patients with high risk of infection, the survey mirrors a large variety of regiments used. Conclusions: The preference to use a single dose of ciprofloxacin 750 mg is in accordance with the Swedish national guidelines for patients with a low risk of infection. Better compliance to the guideline recommendation to use a urine dipstick would probably increase the number of patients classified as having an increased risk of infection. Being classified as a high-risk patient should lead to an extended duration of antibiotic prophylaxis, however, the variety of regimens used in the high-risk group reflects an inability to treat these patients in a standardized fashion and also highlights a need for more clear-cut guidelines. Pre-biopsy identification of high-risk patients is an important issue to tackle for the urologic clinics in order to reduce the number of infections.""","""['Johan Styrke#', 'Sven Resare#', 'Karl-Johan Lundström', 'Patrick Masaba', 'Christofer Lagerros', 'Pär Stattin']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""F1000Res""","""['Current routines for transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy: a web-based survey by the Swedish Urology Network.', 'Comparison of Single and Prolonged Fluoroquinolone Prophylaxis and Risk Factors for Infectious Complications After Transrectal Prostate Biopsy.', 'Ciprofloxacin resistance in the faecal carriage of patients undergoing transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.', 'Antibiotic prophylaxis in prostate biopsy.', 'Antibiotic prophylaxis and complications following prostate biopsies - a systematic review.', 'Occurrence and significance of fluoroquinolone-resistant and ESBL-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae complex of the rectal flora in Ghanaian patients undergoing prostate biopsy.', 'Comparison of Fluoroquinolones and Other Antibiotic Prophylaxis Regimens for Preventing Complications in Patients Undergoing Transrectal Prostate Biopsy.', 'Recent Trends in Prostate Biopsy Complication Rates and the Role of Aztreonam in Periprocedural Antimicrobial Prophylaxis-A Nationwide Population-Based Study from Korea.']"""

To identify the synthetic lethal compounds working with PTEN deficiency, we performed a synthetic lethality drug screening with PTEN-isogenic colorectal cancer cells. From the screening, we found that PTEN-/- colorectal cancer cells were sensitive to anacardic acid, a p300/CBP histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitor. Anacardic acid significantly reduced the viability of PTEN-/- cells not in PTEN+/+ cells via inducing apoptosis. Inhibition of HAT activity of p300/CBP by anacardic acid reduced the acetylation of histones at the promoter region and inhibited the transcription of Hsp70 family of proteins. The down-regulation of Hsp70 family proteins led to the reduction of AKT-Hsp70 complex formation, AKT destabilization and decreased the level of phosphorylated AKT at Ser473, all of which are vital for the survival of PTEN-/- colorectal cells. The synthetic lethality effect of anacardic acid was further validated in tumor xenograft mice models, where PTEN-/- colorectal tumors showed greater sensitivity to anacardic acid treatment than PTEN+/+ tumors. These data suggest that anacardic acid induced synthetic lethality by inhibiting HAT activity of p300/CBP, thereby reducing Hsp70 transcription and destabilizing AKT in PTEN deficient colorectal cancer cells.""","""['Yifan Liu', 'Eun Ju Yang', 'Changxiang Shi', 'Pui Kei Mou', 'Baoyuan Zhang', 'Changjie Wu', 'Junfang Lyu', 'Joong Sup Shim']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Biol Sci""","""['Histone acetyltransferase p300 is induced by p38MAPK after photodynamic therapy: the therapeutic response is increased by the p300HAT inhibitor anacardic acid.', 'Targeting p300 Addiction in CBP-Deficient Cancers Causes Synthetic Lethality by Apoptotic Cell Death due to Abrogation of MYC Expression.', 'Inhibition of PCAF by anacardic acid derivative leads to apoptosis and breaks resistance to DNA damage in BCR-ABL-expressing cells.', 'CREB-binding protein, p300, butyrate, and Wnt signaling in colorectal cancer.', 'Current development of CBP/p300 inhibitors in the last decade.', 'Synthetic lethal approaches to target cancers with loss of PTEN function.', 'P300 promotes tumor recurrence by regulating radiation-induced conversion of glioma stem cells to vascular-like cells.', 'Anacardic Acids from Amphipterygium adstringens Confer Cytoprotection against 5-Fluorouracil and Carboplatin Induced Blood Cell Toxicity While Increasing Antitumoral Activity and Survival in an Animal Model of Breast Cancer.', 'Garcinol-A Natural Histone Acetyltransferase Inhibitor and New Anti-Cancer Epigenetic Drug.']"""

Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) could guide immune cells toward tumor cells, and produced remarkable effects in some cancers.  Methods:   In this study, a bispecific antibody targeting both tumor antigen PRLR and T cell surface CD3 antigen (PRLR-DbsAb) was constructed by split intein mediated protein transsplicing (BAPTS) system for the first time. Its binding activity was determined by Biacore and Flow cytometry, and target-dependent T cell mediated cytotoxicity was detected using LDH release assay. ELISA was utilized to study the secretion of cytokines by immune cells. Subcutaneous tumor mouse models were used to analyze the in vivo anti-tumor effects of PRLR-DbsAb.  Results:   PRLR-DbsAb in vitro could recruit and activate T cells to promote the release of Th1 cytokines IFN- γ and TNF- α, which could kill PRLR expressed breast cancer cells.

At this moment, there are no specific treatment recommendations for patients with limited nodal recurrences and different locoregional treatment approaches are currently being used, mostly by means of metastasis-directed therapies (MDT): salvage lymph node dissection (sLND) or stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). Since the majority of patients treated with MDT relapse within 2 years in adjacent lymph node regions, with an estimated median time to progression of 12-18 months, combining MDT with whole pelvic radiotherapy (WPRT) may improve oncological outcomes in these patients. The aim of this prospective multicentre randomized controlled phase II trial is to assess the impact of the addition of WPRT to MDT and short-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) on metastasis-free survival (MFS) in the setting of oligorecurrent pelvic nodal recurrence.  Methods & design:   Patients diagnosed with PET-detected pelvic nodal oligorecurrence (≤5 nodes) following radical local treatment for PCa, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio between arm A: MDT and 6 months of ADT, or arm B: WPRT added to MDT and 6 months of ADT. Patients will be stratified by type of PET-tracer (choline, FACBC or PSMA) and by type of MDT (sLND or SBRT). The primary endpoint is MFS and the secondary endpoints include clinical and biochemical progression-free survival (PFS), prostate cancer specific survival, quality of life (QoL), toxicity and time to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and to palliative ADT.

To this aim, we compiled and analysed currently available post-GWAS data that is validated through further studies in prostate cancer, to investigate molecular biological pathways enriched for assigned functional genes. In total, about 100 canonical pathways were significantly, at false discovery rate (FDR)< 0.05), enriched in assigned genes using different algorithms. The results have highlighted some well-known cancer signalling pathways, antigen presentation processes and enrichment in cell growth and development gene networks, suggesting risk loci may exert their functional effect on prostate cancer by acting through multiple gene sets and pathways. Additional upstream analysis of the involved genes identified critical transcription factors such as HDAC1 and STAT5A. We also investigated the common genes between post-GWAS and three well-annotated gene expression datasets to endeavour to uncover the main genes involved in prostate cancer development/progression.

Methods:   PCa stem cells were sorted and identified using flow cytometry and THBS4 expression in the identified PCa stem cells was measured using Western blot assay. THBS4 was overexpressed or silenced in PCa stem cells, following which, self-renewal, proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and apoptosis of PCa stem cells were assessed as well as tumorigenicity in vivo was evaluated. PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitor was applied to identify its involvement in the regulatory roles of THBS4 in PCa stem cells.  Results:   THBS4 was expressed at a higher level in PCa stem cells than in PCa cells. The overexpression of THBS4 promoted the self-renewal and proliferation, curbed the apoptosis of PCa stem cells, and enhanced the in vivo tumorigenicity, which was achieved by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway. On the contrary, short-hairpin RNA-mediated silencing of THBS4 exhibited suppressive effects on those cancer stem cell (CSC)-like properties and promotive effects on their apoptosis.

The two serum proteins were shown to improve the diagnosis of high-grade PCa. Thus, we developed quantitative ELISAs for the determination of their concentration in human serum. Here we report their analytical performance in terms of limit of detection, specificity, precision, linearity and interferences, which were determined based on CLSI guidelines. Further, we investigated the influence of pre-analytical factors on concentration measurements. For this, blood from 4-6 donors was collected in different tubes and stored at room temperature for different times prior to centrifugation at different centrifugal forces and temperatures. Stability of THBS1 and CTSD under different storage temperatures was also evaluated. Our results show that the assays are specific, linear and sensitive enough to allow measurement of clinical samples. Precision in terms of repeatability and total within-laboratory coefficient of variation (CV) are 5.5% and 8.1% for THBS1 and 4.3% and 7.2% for CTSD, respectively. Relative laboratory-to-laboratory differences were -6.3% for THBS1 and -3% for CTSD. Both THBS1 and CTSD were stable in serum samples, with 80-120% recoveries of concentrations across donors, sample preparation and storage. In conclusion, the ELISAs as part of the novel commercial in vitro diagnostic test Proclarix are suitable for the use in clinical practice.

The BDT evaluations were analyzed through two methods: 1. fixed gantry angle delivery (BDTfixed) and 2. An in-house dynamic arc scanning controller simulation which considered of gantry rotation speed, acceleration and deceleration (BDTarc).  Results:   With a similar total number of energy layers, SPArc_seq plans provided a similar nominal plan quality and plan robustness compared to SPArc_orig plans. SPArc_seq significantly reduced the number of ascended ELS by 83% (19 vs.115), 70% (16 vs. 64), 82% (19 vs. 104), 80% (19 vs. 94) and 70% (9 vs. 30), which effectively shortened the BDTfixed by 65% (386 vs. 1091 s), 61% (235 vs. 609 s), 64% (336 vs. 928 s), 48% (787 vs.1521 s) and 25% (384 vs. 511 s) and shortened BDTarc by 54% (522 vs.1128 s), 52% (310 vs.645 s), 53% (443 vs. 951 s), 49% (803 vs.1583 s) and 26% (398 vs. 534 s) in prostate, lung, brain, HNC and breast cancer, respectively.  Conclusions:   The SPArc_seq optimization algorithm could effectively reduce the BDT compared to the original SPArc algorithm. The improved efficiency of the SPArc_seq algorithm has the potential to increase patient throughput, thereby reducing the operation cost of proton therapy.""","""['Gang Liu', 'Xiaoqiang Li', 'Lewei Zhao', 'Weili Zheng', 'An Qin', 'Sheng Zhang', 'Craig Stevens', 'Di Yan', 'Peyman Kabolizadeh', 'Xuanfeng Ding']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Spot-Scanning Proton Arc (SPArc) Therapy: The First Robust and Delivery-Efficient Spot-Scanning Proton Arc Therapy.', 'Improve the dosimetric outcome in bilateral head and neck cancer (HNC) treatment using spot-scanning proton arc (SPArc) therapy: a feasibility study.', 'Feasibility study: spot-scanning proton arc therapy (SPArc) for left-sided whole breast radiotherapy.', 'A novel energy layer optimization framework for spot-scanning proton arc therapy.', 'Improve dosimetric outcome in stage III non-small-cell lung cancer treatment using spot-scanning proton arc (SPArc) therapy.', 'Proton Arc Therapy vs Interstitial HDR Brachytherapy in Gynecologic Cancer with Parametrial/pelvic Side Wall Extension.', 'Developing an accurate model of spot-scanning treatment delivery time and sequence for a compact superconducting synchrocyclotron proton therapy system.', 'Future Developments in Charged Particle Therapy: Improving Beam Delivery for Efficiency and Efficacy.', 'Spot-Scanning Hadron Arc (SHArc) Therapy: A Study With Light and Heavy Ions.', 'Biological and Mechanical Synergies to Deal With Proton Therapy Pitfalls: Minibeams, FLASH, Arcs, and Gantryless Rooms.']"""

With more than 1.4 million new cases diagnosed globally per year, there is a need for non-invasive options to assist sexual dysfunction recovery.  Aim:   Commencing preoperatively and using both fast and slow twitch fibre training performed in standing postures, new protocols were developed to address clinical presentations with aims to reduce ED and impact on quality of life (QoL). Comparisons with ""usual care"" PFM training, prerehabilitation and postrehabilitation were then assessed.  Methods:   A randomised controlled trial of 97 men undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) were allocated to either a control group (n = 47) performing ""usual care"" of 3 sets/d PFMT or an intervention group (n = 50), performing 6 sets/d in standing, commencing 5 weeks before RP.  Outcome measures:   Participants were assessed preoperatively and at 2, 6, and 12 weeks after RP using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice, International Index of Erectile Function-5, and real time ultrasound measurements of PFM function.  Results:   At all time points, there was a significant difference (P< 0.05) between groups; however, the only time point where this difference was clinically relevant was at 2 weeks after RP, with the intervention group reporting less distress in the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice QoL outcome. Secondary measures of EPIC-EF and real time ultrasound PFM function tests demonstrated improvement over all time points in both groups with lower bothersome scores in the intervention group.  Conclusions:   Early PFM training reduces early QoL impact for postprostatectomy ED, with faster return to continence enabling earlier commencement of penile rehabilitation. While our 12-week protocol and sample size was not powerful enough to demonstrate conclusive benefits of early PFM training for ED, PFM intervention after RP over longer times has been supported by others.

Biparametric prostate MRI (bpMRI) is faster and could be a feasible alternative to mpMRI.  Objective:   To determine the negative predictive value (NPV) of Improved Prostate Cancer Diagnosis (IMPROD) bpMRI as a whole and in clinical subgroups in primary diagnostics of clinically significant prostate cancer (CSPCa).  Design, setting, and participants:   This is a pooled data analysis of four prospective, registered clinical trials investigating prebiopsy IMPROD bpMRI. Men with a clinical suspicion of prostate cancer (PCa) were included.  Intervention:   Prebiopsy IMPROD bpMRI was performed, and an IMPROD bpMRI Likert scoring system was used. If suspicious lesions (IMPROD bpMRI Likert score 3-5) were visible, targeted biopsies in addition to systematic biopsies were taken.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Performance measures of IMPROD bpMRI in CSPCa diagnostics were evaluated. NPV was also evaluated in clinical subgroups. Gleason grade ≥3 + 4 in any biopsy core taken was defined as CSPCa.  Results and limitations:   A total of 639 men were included in the analysis. The mean age was 64 yr, mean prostate-specific antigen level was 8.9 ng/ml, and CSPCa prevalence was 48%. NPVs of IMPROD bpMRI Likert scores 3-5 and 4-5 for CSPCa were 0.932 and 0.909, respectively, and the corresponding positive predictive values were 0.589 and 0.720. Only nine of 132 (7%) men with IMPROD bpMRI Likert score 1-2 had CSPCa and none with Gleason score >7. Thus, 132 of 639 (21%) study patients could have avoided biopsies without missing a single Gleason >7 cancer in the study biopsies. In the subgroup analysis, no clear outlier was present. The limitation is uncertainty of the true CSPCa prevalence.  Conclusions:   IMPROD bpMRI demonstrated a high NPV to rule out CSPCa. IMPROD bpMRI Likert score 1-2 excludes Gleason >7 PCa in the study biopsies.  Patient summary:   We investigated the feasibility of prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the Improved Prostate Cancer Diagnosis (IMPROD) biparametric MRI (bpMRI) protocol in excluding significant prostate cancer.

The primary purpose was to investigate the eligibility for upfront intensification therapy based on the progression of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The secondary purpose included the comparison of the metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer progression rate, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer-free survival and overall survival after castration-resistance in CHAARTED low- or high-volume disease patients.  Results:   The number of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer progression was 119 (52%) and 319 (71%) in the low- and high-volume disease groups, respectively.

Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed no significant association between tumor burden and overall survival after castration resistance (P = 0.522; hazard ratio 1.14).  Conclusions:   The progression rate in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with the low-volume disease under conventional androgen deprivation therapy is approximately 50%.

Methods:   41 consecutive patients were treated with salvage radiotherapy. At biochemical recurrence after primary treatment, oligorecurrent disease was detected by positron emission tomography (PET) in 94% of the patients.

Unfortunately, even after RT ± ADT, a significant number of patients will develop 'second' BCR. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of postoperative treatments (adjuvant/salvage radiotherapy (RT) ± androgen deprivation therapy) on the recurrence pattern in patients with BCR following RP assessed by 11C-Choline PET/CT or 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT.  Methods:   Patients who developed BCR following RP and who had at least one positive lesion on PET/CT were retrospectively assessed. Positive spots were mapped as local, lymph node (LN), skeletal or visceral recurrence. A distinction was made between locoregional (prostate bed and pelvic LN) and extrapelvic recurrence (skeletal, visceral and/or extrapelvic LN). Patients were categorized according to postoperative treatment received in three subgroups (RT, ADT and RT + ADT) and compared with the reference group (RP only). The impact of the radiation field was also investigated.  Results:   We identified 200 patients assessed by 68Ga-PSMA-11 (80%) or 11C-Choline PET/CT (20%). Patients who received postoperative RT + ADT had less LN recurrence distal to the common iliac bifurcation (26.7% vs 66.6%; p = 0.0004), but more recurrence to retroperitoneal LN than the reference group (38% vs. 14.4%, p = 0.02). Moreover, the RT + ADT subgroup had more extrapelvic recurrence compared to the reference group (66.2% vs 40.8%, p = 0.02). Patients who received RT to the prostate bed had more recurrence distal to the common iliac bifurcation compared to those who received RT to the prostate bed + pelvic LN (51.6% vs 26.1%, p = 0.0069).  Conclusion:   Post-prostatectomy treatments (ADT and/or RT) and the postoperative radiation field (prostate bed vs. prostate bed + pelvis) have a significant impact on the recurrence pattern.

Subset analyses revealed that all these associations were strongly driven by the fraction of cancers lacking the TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion. Comparison with other key molecular data that were earlier obtained on the same TMA showed that hnRNPA1 overexpression was linked to high levels of androgen receptor (AR) expression (p < 0.0001) as well as presence of 9 of 11 chromosomal deletions (p < 0.05 each). A strong association between hnRNPA1 upregulation and tumor cell proliferation that was independent from the Gleason score supports a role for tumor cell aggressiveness. In conclusion, hnRNPA1 overexpression is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in ERG-negative prostate cancer. hnRNPA1 measurement, either alone or in combination, might provide prognostic information in ERG-negative prostate cancer.""","""['Katharina Möller', 'Anna Lena Wecker', 'Doris Höflmayer', 'Christoph Fraune', 'Georgia Makrypidi-Fraune', 'Claudia Hube-Magg', 'Martina Kluth', 'Stefan Steurer', 'Till S Clauditz', 'Waldemar Wilczak', 'Ronald Simon', 'Guido Sauter', 'Hartwig Huland', 'Hans Heinzer', 'Alexander Haese', 'Thorsten Schlomm', 'Sören Weidemann', 'Andreas M Luebke', 'Sarah Minner', 'Christian Bernreuther', 'Sarah Bonk', 'Andreas Marx']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Virchows Arch""","""['High nuclear karyopherin α 2 expression is a strong and independent predictor of biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer patients treated by radical prostatectomy.', 'Secreted Frizzled-Related Protein 4 (SFRP4) Is an Independent Prognostic Marker in Prostate Cancers Lacking TMPRSS2: ERG Fusions.', 'Down-Regulation of S100A8 is an Independent Predictor of PSA Recurrence in Prostate Cancer Treated by Radical Prostatectomy.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Evolution in Prostate Cancer Staging: Pathology Updates From AJCC 8th Edition and Opportunities That Remain.', 'Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A/B: an emerging group of cancer biomarkers and therapeutic targets.', 'Exosome-Derived miRNAs as Potential Biomarkers for Prostate Bone Metastasis.']"""

Progranulin regulates remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton by interacting with drebrin, an actin binding protein that regulates tumor growth. We previously discovered that progranulin depletion inhibits epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and markedly reduces in vivo tumor growth. Moreover, progranulin depletion sensitizes urothelial cancer cells to cisplatin treatment, further substantiating a pro-survival function of progranulin. Until recently, the progranulin signaling receptor remained unidentified, precluding a full understanding of progranulin action in tumor cell biology. We recently identified EphA2, a member of a large family of receptor tyrosine-kinases, as the functional receptor for progranulin. However, it is not established whether EphA2 plays an oncogenic role in bladder cancer. Here we demonstrate that progranulin, and not ephrin-A1, the canonical ligand for EphA2, is the predominant EphA2 ligand in bladder cancer. Progranulin evoked Akt- and Erk1/2-mediated EphA2 phosphorylation at Ser897, which could drive bladder tumorigenesis. We discovered that EphA2 depletion severely blunted progranulin-dependent motility and anchorage-independent growth, and sensitized bladder cancer cells to cisplatin treatment. We further defined the mechanisms of progranulin/EphA2-dependent motility by identifying liprin-α1 as a novel progranulin-dependent EphA2 interacting protein and establishing its critical role in cell motility. The discovery of EphA2 as the functional signaling receptor for progranulin and the identification of novel downstream effectors offer a new avenue for understanding the underlying mechanism of progranulin action and may constitute novel clinical and therapeutic targets in bladder cancer.""","""['Simone Buraschi', 'Thomas Neill', 'Shi-Qiong Xu', 'Chiara Palladino', 'Antonino Belfiore', 'Renato V Iozzo', 'Andrea Morrione']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Matrix Biol""","""['Progranulin Oncogenic Network in Solid Tumors.', 'Complexity of progranulin mechanisms of action in mesothelioma.', 'Suppression of progranulin expression inhibits bladder cancer growth and sensitizes cancer cells to cisplatin.', 'A novel role for drebrin in regulating progranulin bioactivity in bladder cancer.', 'Emerging and Diverse Functions of the EphA2 Noncanonical Pathway in Cancer Progression.', 'Construction of prognostic risk model of bladder cancer based on cuproptosis-related long non-coding RNAs.', 'Progranulin Oncogenic Network in Solid Tumors.', 'EphA2 Promotes the Development of Cervical Cancer through the CXCL11/PD-L1 Pathway.', 'Complexity of progranulin mechanisms of action in mesothelioma.', 'PGRN exacerbates the progression of non-small cell lung cancer via PI3K/AKT/Bcl-2 antiapoptotic signaling.']"""

We report an update of a multicentre, Canadian randomized phase II study to investigate the impact of overall treatment time on quality of life (QOL), efficacy, and toxicity.  Methods:   Men with intermediate risk prostate cancer were randomized to 40 Gy in 5 fractions delivered every other day (EOD) versus once per week (QW). Primary outcome was proportion of patients experiencing a minimally clinically important change (MCIC) in acute bowel QOL using EPIC. Secondary outcomes were toxicity, biochemical failure (BF), other QOL domains, and the rate of salvage therapy.  Findings:   152 men from 3 centers were randomized; the median follow-up was 62 months. Results are described for EOD versus QW. Acute bowel and urinary QOL was reported previously. Late changes in QOL were not significantly different between the two arms. There were 1 (1.3%) vs 3 (2.7%) late grade 3 + GI toxicities (p = 0.36) and 5 (6.7%) vs 2 (2.7%) late grade 3 GU toxicities (p = 0.44). Two and 5 patients had BF (5-year failure rate 3.0 vs 7.2%, p = 0.22); 0 and 4 patients received salvage therapy (p = 0.04). 5-Year OS and CSS was 95.8% and 98.6% with no difference between arms (p = 0.49, p = 0.15). 3 patients in the QW arm developed metastases.  Interpretation:   Although we previously reported that weekly prostate SABR had better bowel and urinary QOL compared to EOD, the updated results show no difference in late toxicity, QOL, BF, or PSA kinetics.

Receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (ROR2), a noncanonical Wnt receptor, plays crucial roles in skeletal morphogenesis, osteoblast differentiation, and bone formation. The role of ROR2 in PCa metastasis is unclear. We analyzed online datasets from Oncomine as well as using IHC staining on tissue array to determine the relationship between ROR2 expression level and disease outcome of PCa. To investigate how ROR2 regulates migration and invasion of PCa cells, we performed transwell assay and orthotopic xenograft model in nude mice. We then applied the Micro-Western Array (MWA), a high-throughput western blotting platform to analyze the downstream signaling pathways being regulated by ROR2. Compared with nonmalignant PZ-HPV-7 and RWPE-1 cells, PCa cell lines express lower level of ROR2 protein. Constitutive expression of ROR2 in PC-3, DU-145, or C4-2B PCa cells significantly suppressed the cell migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) proteins. MWA, western blotting, and microRNA analysis showed that elevation of ROR2 suppressed the expression of miR-199a-5p, which in turn increased the expression of PIAS3. The upregulation of PIAS3 then decreased AKT2 and the phosphorylation of AKT, resulting in the inhibition of migration and invasion of PCa cells both in vitro and in orthotopic xenograft mice model. IHC staining of tissue array and Oncomine datasets analysis indicated that the gene and protein level of ROR2 is much lower in metastatic prostate tumors as compared with primary tumors or adjacent normal prostate tissues. Low level of ROR2 correlated to poor survival and high recurrent frequency in PCa patients. In conclusion, we discovered that ROR2 suppresses PCa metastasis via regulation of PIAS3-PI3K-AKT2 signaling axis.""","""['Jen-Chih Tseng', 'Shih-Han Huang', 'Ching-Yu Lin', 'Bi-Juan Wang', 'Shiu-Feng Huang', 'Ying-Ying Shen', 'Chih-Pin Chuu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['miR-199a-5p promotes proliferation and metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition through targeting PIAS3 in cervical carcinoma.', 'CAPE suppresses migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells via activation of non-canonical Wnt signaling.', 'miR-199b-5p-DDR1-ERK signalling axis suppresses prostate cancer metastasis via inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'Cellular and molecular mechanisms implicated in the dual role of ROR2 in cancer.', 'Ror2 as a therapeutic target in cancer.', 'Bufalin suppresses esophageal squamous cell carcinoma progression by activating the PIAS3/STAT3 signaling pathway.', 'Associations between Body Mass Index and Prostate Cancer: The Impact on Progression-Free Survival.', 'WNT5a Signaling through ROR2 Activates the Hippo Pathway to Suppress YAP1 Activity and Tumor Growth.', 'Newly Released Advances in the Molecular Mechanisms of Osseous Metastasis and Potential Therapeutic Strategies.', 'Cancer-Associated Dysregulation of Sumo Regulators: Proteases and Ligases.']"""

Saturation transfer-weighted images were acquired over a wide range of saturation amplitudes and frequency offsets along with T1 and T2 maps for 34 tumour xenografts in mice. Independent component analysis and Gaussian mixture modelling were used to segment the images and identify intratumoural regions. Comparison between the segmented regions and histopathology indicated five distinct clusters: three corresponding to intratumoural regions (active tumour, necrosis/apoptosis, and blood/edema) and two extratumoural (muscle and a mix of muscle and connective tissue). The fraction of tumour voxels segmented as necrosis/apoptosis quantitatively matched those calculated from TUNEL histopathological assays. An optimal protocol was identified providing reasonable qualitative agreement between MRI and histopathology and consisting of T1 and T2 maps and 22 magnetization transfer (MT)-weighted images.

Dose reduction might limit toxicity, but potential loss of efficacy is a concern. We compare up-front low-dose versus standard-dose enzalutamide.  Patients and methods:   Records of prostate cancer patients receiving enzalutamide were retrospectively retrieved. Selection criteria were: age ≥ 75, metastatic disease, surgical or medical castration, and rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Data were excluded of those missing follow-up PSA values. Low-dose enzalutamide (≤ 80 mg per day) was compared to standard dose (160 mg per day). Progression-free survival analyzed the time from start of enzalutamide to event, defined as ≥ 25% and ≥ 2 ng/mL PSA increase above nadir, or death from any cause.  Results:   Fifty-nine patients were identified, of whom 16 received low-dose and 43 standard-dose therapy. Patients in the low-dose group were significantly old, with a median (range) age of 84.6 (74.9-93.8) years; median (range) PSA at start of enzalutamide was 59.2 (11.0-1058.3) ng/mL; 11 had bone metastases only, 2 metastatic lymph nodes only, and 3 bone and lymph node localizations. Pain score was > 3/10 in 4 patients (27%), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was ≥ 2 in 9 (56%); 3 patients had received prior abiraterone and 3 bicalutamide. None received chemotherapy. PSA decrease of ≥ 50% at 12 weeks was observed in 67% patients (10/15), versus 45.0% with standard dose. Median (range) PSA at last follow-up was 1.6 (0-599.3) ng/mL. Median progression-free survival was 11.2 months, versus 11.9 months for patients receiving the standard dose (P = .612).

We reviewed oncological results and complications for 23 men with radiographically recurrent M0 CRPC undergoing sRP at six institutions. Sixteen and ten men experienced at least one and one major (Clavien >2) complication, respectively. After sRP, nine men became incontinent, including two with severe incontinence. The majority of men had aggressive extraprostatic disease (≥pT3b 56.5%; pN1 30.4%; Gleason ≥8 65.2%). Postoperatively 69.6% reached undetectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Seven men had postoperative PSA persistence and six had CRPC persistence. Among the others, biochemical recurrence (BCR) occurred in 68.7% and CRPC in 58.8% at a median of 11 and 31 mo from sRP, respectively. At median follow-up of 4 yr, 17.4% were disease-free, 34.4% had died from PC, and 4.3% had died from other causes. sRP for M0 CRPC is feasible although the risk of complications is significant. A minority of patients can be cured and a significant proportion experience prolonged BCR- and CRPC-free status, thus delaying the need for systemic treatments. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of sRP for M0 CRPC in the era of new antiandrogen therapies. PATIENT SUMMARY: Salvage radical prostatectomy for radiorecurrent M0 castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is feasible, although continence outcomes are suboptimal and the risk of complications is significant.

NASA has established astronaut career radiation limits for cancer of 3% Risk of Exposure Induced Death (REID) at the 95% confidence level. The REID is the increased lifetime risk of death from cancer due to radiation exposure in comparison to an unexposed background population and has been traditionally mitigated by passive shielding design concepts and limiting safe days in space. Additional reduction in radiation exposure risk may be achieved with Medical Countermeasures (MCM). Recent meta-analyses have demonstrated the efficacy of aspirin in the reduction of the background colorectal cancer incidence and mortality rates for specific cohorts. Additional studies of warfarin in patients greater than 50 years of age have indicated statistically significant decreases in stomach, bladder, brain, prostate, and lung cancer incidence as compared to control groups. While ultimate selection of suitable countermeasures will be the responsibility of flight surgeons, this paper presents a general methodology for incorporating MCM into the NASA Space Radiation Cancer Risk model and includes modifications of the background mortality rates (hazard rates) and the radiation risk coefficients to numerically quantify the benefits of MCM. As examples of the method, aspirin and warfarin will be employed as MCM in a sensitivity analysis to compute the REID for astronauts embarking on a one-year deep space mission scenario.""","""['C M Werneth', 'T C Slaba', 'S R Blattnig', 'J L Huff', 'R B Norman']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Life Sci Space Res (Amst)""","""[""Medical Countermeasure Requirements to Meet NASA's Space Radiation Permissible Exposure Limits for a Mars Mission Scenario."", 'Health care for deep space explorers.', 'Dynamical modeling approach to risk assessment for radiogenic leukemia among astronauts engaged in interplanetary space missions.', 'Countermeasure development against space radiation-induced gastrointestinal carcinogenesis: Current and future perspectives.', ""Getting ready for the manned mission to Mars: the astronauts' risk from space radiation.""]"""

AT has been widely studied in vitro and in clinical trials with mixed results. The latest clinical study (SELECT trial) tested AT in prostate cancer patients, determined that AT provided no benefit, and could promote cancer. Conversely, GT3 has shown antineoplastic properties in several in vitro studies, with no clinical studies published to date. GT3 causes apoptosis via upregulation of the JNK pathway; however, inhibition results in a partial block of cell death. We compared side by side the mechanistic differences in these cells in response to AT and GT3.  Methods:   The effects of GT3 and AT were studied on androgen sensitive LNCaP and androgen independent PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Their cytotoxic effects were analyzed via MTT and confirmed by metabolic assays measuring ATP. Cellular pathways were studied by immunoblot. Quantitative analysis and the determination of relationships between cell signaling events were analyzed for both agents tested. Non-cancerous prostate RWPE-1 cells were also included as a control.  Results:   The RAF/RAS/ERK pathway was significantly activated by GT3 in LNCaP and PC-3 cells but not by AT. This activation is essential for the apoptotic affect by GT3 as demonstrated the complete inhibition of apoptosis by MEK1 inhibitor U0126. Phospho-c-JUN was upregulated by GT3 but not AT. No changes were observed on AKT for either agent, and no release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm was detected. Caspases 9 and 3 were efficiently activated by GT3 on both cell lines irrespective of androgen sensitivity, but not in cells dosed with AT. Cell viability of non-cancerous RWPE-1 cells was affected neither by GT3 nor AT.  Conclusions:   c-JUN is a recognized master regulator of apoptosis as shown previously in prostate cancer. However, the mechanism of action of GT3 in these cells also include a significant activation of ERK which is essential for the apoptotic effect of GT3. The activation of both, ERK and c-JUN, is required for apoptosis and may suggest a relevant step in ensuring circumvention of mechanisms of resistance related to the constitutive activation of MEK1.""","""['Christine Moore', 'Victoria E Palau', 'Rashid Mahboob', 'Janet Lightner', 'William Stone', 'Koyamangalath Krishnan']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Critical roles for JNK, c-Jun, and Fas/FasL-Signaling in vitamin E analog-induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Gamma-tocopherol induces apoptosis in androgen-responsive LNCaP prostate cancer cells via caspase-dependent and independent mechanisms.', 'Grape seed extract inhibits EGF-induced and constitutively active mitogenic signaling but activates JNK in human prostate carcinoma DU145 cells: possible role in antiproliferation and apoptosis.', 'Anti-inflammatory properties of alpha- and gamma-tocopherol.', 'Vitamin E isoforms as modulators of lung inflammation.', 'Necroptosis Induced by Delta-Tocotrienol Overcomes Docetaxel Chemoresistance in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Effect of vitamins C and E on cancer survival; a systematic review.', 'Revisiting the therapeutic potential of tocotrienol.', 'SAR Probing of KX2-391 Provided Analogues With Juxtaposed Activity Profile Against Major Oncogenic Kinases.', 'Differential Mechanisms of Action and Efficacy of Vitamin E Components in Antioxidant Cytoprotection of Human Retinal Pigment Epithelium.']"""

HAL, a cancer specific photosensitizer, was then used to circumvent the need for prestaining. Optimum HAL incubation conditions were identified (50 μM at 37 °C for 2 h) where the mean HAL-induced fluorescence intensity of LNCaP cells was three times that of healthy PNT2 cells, thus providing an independent way to discriminate captured cancer cells from background metabolites.

Comparative analysis was performed between systematic and targeted biopsy using McNemar's test, and the cohort was further stratified by prior biopsy status and Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) v2.0 score. International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade group (GG) ≥2 cancers (previously known as Gleason grade ≥7) were considered to be clinically significant.  Results:   A total of 500 patients were included in our final analysis, of whom 67 (13%) were patients with low-risk cancer on active surveillance. Of the 433 patients without prior diagnosis of cancer, 288 (67%) were biopsy-naïve. A total of 248 (57%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer, with 199 (46%) having clinically significant prostate cancer (ISUP GG ≥2). There were no statistically significant differences in the overall prostate cancer and clinically significant prostate cancer detection rate between systematic and targeted biopsy (51% vs 49% and 40% vs 38% respectively; P = 0.306 and P = 0.609). Of the 248 prostate cancers detected, 75% (187/248) were detected on both systematic and targeted biopsy, 14% (35/248) were detected on systematic biopsy alone and 11% (26/248) were detected on targeted biopsy alone. Of the 199 clinically significant cancers detected, 69% (138/199) were detected on both systematic and targeted biopsy, 17% (33/199) on systematic biopsy alone and 14% (28/199) on targeted biopsy alone. There were no statistically significant differences in the detection rate between systematic and targeted biopsy for both overall and clinically significant prostate cancer, even when the cohort was stratified by prior biopsy status and PI-RADS score.

Their presence in the skull remains a rare entity. Despite their benign characteristics, imaging modalities are often unable to distinguish them from malignant lesions. This leads to a diagnostic dilemma in patients with underlying malignancy. This case report highlights such a case where clinical history of prostate cancer and image findings were concordant with that of metastatic deposit in the parietal skull region.  Case description:   This 65-year-old gentleman was diagnosed with prostatic adenocarcinoma. During systemic workup for his tumor, he was found to have a right parietal skull lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, as well as a bone scan, were consistent with that of a metastatic deposit. As treatment would be drastically affected by the diagnosis, an excision biopsy was performed. The histology was consistent with that of a bone xanthoma.  Conclusions:   Xanthomas are benign lesions that can be seen deposited in appendicular and axial skeleton. Skull lesions are rare with most case descriptions focusing on their presence in the frontoorbital regions and mandible and temporal bone. They usually have a benign course but may present with symptoms due to localized mass effect.

Because of their age and comorbidities, older patients may receive suboptimal cancer therapy. This article addresses trends in cancer incidence and reports key treatment outcomes in this age group.  Materials and methods:   This is a retrospective study using data obtained from the national Jordan Cancer Registry (JCR) and our institutional cancer registry. The first data set reports only on demographics, whereas the second data set reports also on treatment outcomes. Older patients were defined as those age 65 years or older at time of diagnosis.  Results:   Between 2001 and 2015, a total of 19,397 older patients were diagnosed with cancer, representing 29.8% of the total 65,050 patients with cancer diagnosed during this time. More men than women developed cancer, and colorectal, breast, lung, prostate, and bladder cancers were the most commonly reported cancers. Among this age group over the 15-year study period, cancer diagnoses increased by a rate of 77%, much higher than the 55% increment among all ages during the same study period. The 5-year survival rate for all of the 3,821 older patients diagnosed, treated, and followed up at our institution was 33% but varied by stage (63% for stage I disease and 14% for stage IV disease).  Conclusion:   Cancer diagnoses among older patients are increasing at a rate higher than that of all ages and much higher than the witnessed increase in Jordanian population in same age group, which highlights the importance of looking for factors other than just aging to explain this increase. Strategies to offer better care for this rapidly expanding group are highly needed.""","""['Hikmat Abdel-Razeq', 'Asem Mansour', 'Rayan Bater']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""JCO Glob Oncol""","""['Italian cancer figures, report 2012: Cancer in children and adolescents.', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Prophylactic Oophorectomy: Reducing the U.S. Death Rate from Epithelial Ovarian Cancer.

Many Viola species are used as medicinal herbs across Asia and are often consumed by humans in teas for the treatment of diseases, including ulcers and asthma. Previous studies reported the isolation of cyclotides from Viola species in many countries in the hope of discovering novel compounds with anti-cancer activities; however, Viola species from Vietnam have not been investigated to date. Here, the discovery of cyclotides from three Viola species (V. arcuata, V. tonkinensis, and V. austrosinensis) collected in the northern mountainous region of Vietnam is reported. Ten cyclotides were isolated from these three Viola species: four are novel and six were previously reported to be expressed in other plants. The structures of three of the new bracelet cyclotides are similar to that of cycloviolacin O2. Because cycloviolacin O2 has previously been shown to have potent activity against a wide range of cancer cell lines including HeLa (human cervical cancer cells) and PC-3 (human prostate cancer cells), the cancer cytotoxicity of the cyclotides isolated from V. arcuata was assessed. All tested cyclotides were cytotoxic against cancer cells, albeit to varying degrees. The sequences discovered in this study significantly expand the understanding of cyclotide diversity, especially in comparison with other cyclotides found in plants from the Asian region.""","""['Tien T Dang', 'Lai Y Chan', 'Yen-Hua Huang', 'Linh T T Nguyen', 'Quentin Kaas', 'Tien Huynh', 'David J Craik']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Nat Prod""","""['Production of bioactive cyclotides in somatic embryos of Viola odorata.', 'A novel suite of cyclotides from Viola odorata: sequence variation and the implications for structure, function and stability.', 'Isolation and characterization of cytotoxic cyclotides from Viola philippica.', 'Novel strategies for isolation and characterization of cyclotides: the discovery of bioactive macrocyclic plant polypeptides in the Violaceae.', 'An overview of acyclotides: Past, present and future.', 'Application of chloroplast genome in the identification of Traditional Chinese Medicine Viola philippica.']"""

Profiling of hypoxia inducible-gene expression of these different cancer cell lines can be used as baseline data for further studies.  Methods:   Human cancer cell lines obtained from the American Type Culture Collection were used; MCF7 breast cancer cells, PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells, PC-3 prostate cancer cells, SHSY5Y neuroblastoma brain cancer cells, A549 lung cancer cells, and HEPG2 hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, we used the MCF10A non-tumorigenic human breast epithelial cell line as a normal cell line. The differences in gene expression were examined using real-time PCR array (PAHS- 032Z, Human Hypoxia Signaling Pathway PCR Array) and analyzed using the ΔΔCt method.  Results:   Almost all hypoxia-inducible genes showed a PO2-dependent up- and down-regulated expression. Noticeable gene expression differences were identified. The most important changes occurred in the HIF1α and NF-KB signaling pathways targeted genes and in central carbon metabolism pathway genes such as HKs, PFKL, and solute transporters.  Conclusion:   This study identified possible hypoxia biomarkers genes such as NF-KB, HIF1α, HK, PFKL, and PIM1 that were expressed in all hypoxic cells. Pleiotropic pathways that play a role in inducing hypoxia directly, such as HIF1 α and NF-kB pathways, were upregulated. In addition, genes expressed only in the severe hypoxic liver and pancreatic cells indicate that severe and intermediate hypoxic cancer cells vary in their gene expression.

Hitherto, no stereoselective pharmacokinetic data have been published pertaining to darolutamide and its diastereomers in animals or humans. The key aims of the experiment were to examine darolutamide, S,S-darolutamide and S,R-darolutamide with respect to (a) assessment of in vitro metabolic stability and protein binding and (b) characterization of in vivo oral and intravenous pharmacokinetics in mice.  Methods:   In vitro (liver microsomes stability and protein binding) and in vivo experiments (oral/intravenous dosing to mice) were carried out using darolutamide, S,S-darolutamide and S,Rdarolutamide. Besides, tissue levels of darolutamide, S,S-darolutamide and S,R-darolutamide were measured following oral and intravenous dosing. Appropriate plasma/tissue samples served to determine the pharmacokinetics of various analytes in mice. Liquid chromatography in tandem with mass spectrometry procedures enabled the delineation of the plasma pharmacokinetics, in vitro and tissue uptake data of the various analytes.  Results:   Chiral inversion was absent in the metabolic stability study. However, darolutamide showed profound stereoselectivity (S,S-darolutamide greater than S,R-darolutamide) after either intravenous or oral dosing. S,R-darolutamide but not S,S-darolutamide showed conversion to its antipode post oral and intravenous dosing to mice. Regardless of oral or intravenous dosing, active keto darolutamide formation was evident after administration of darolutamide, S,S-darolutamide or S,R- darolutamide. Tissue data supported the observations in plasma; however, tissue exposure of darolutamide, S,Sdarolutamide and S,R-darolutamide was much lower as compared to plasma.  Conclusion:   In lieu of the human pharmacokinetic data, although the administration of diastereomeric darolutamide was justified, it is proposed to delineate the clinical pharmacokinetics of S,Rdarolutamide and S,S-darolutamide relative to darolutamide in future clinical pharmacology studies.""","""['Neeraj K Saini', 'Bhavesh B Gabani', 'Umesh Todmal', 'Suresh P Sulochana', 'Vinay Kiran', 'Mohd Zainuddin', 'Narayanan Balaji', 'Sai B Polina', 'Nuggehally R Srinivas', 'Ramesh Mullangi']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Drug Metab Lett""","""['Pharmacokinetics of Darolutamide, its Diastereomers and Active Metabolite in the Mouse: Response to Saini NK et al.

Differentiating between aggressive and indolent cases has resulted in increased difficulty for the physician and patient to decide on the best treatment option. Due to this challenge, efforts are underway to profile genetic risk for prostate cancer aggressiveness, which may help physicians and patients at risk for developing aggressive prostate cancer to select an appropriate treatment option. This study explores patients' interest in receiving genetic results, preference for how genetic risk information should be communicated, and willingness to share results with adult male first-degree relatives (FDRs). A nine-item survey was adapted to assess their beliefs and attitudes about genetic testing for prostate cancer aggressiveness. In addition, participants (n = 50) responded to hypothetical scenarios and questions associated with perceived importance of risk disclosure, preferences for receiving genetic risk information, and sharing of results with FDRs. As the hypothetical risk estimate for aggressive prostate cancer increased, patients' willingness to receive genetic risk information increased. This study found that most patients preferred receiving genetic risk education in the form of a DVD (76%), one-page informational sheet (75%), or educational booklet (70%). Almost all patients (98%) reported that they would be willing to share their test results with FDRs. The results of this study highlight prostate cancer patients' desire to receive and share genetic risk information. Future research should focus on assessing the long-term benefits of receiving genetic information for prostate cancer patients and implications of sharing this information with FDRs.""","""['Siddhartha Roy', 'Clement K Gwede', 'Teri L Malo', 'Courtney L Scherr', 'Selina Radlein', 'Cathy D Meade', 'Susan T Vadaparampil', 'Jong Y Park']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Am J Mens Health""","""['Genetic testing for prostate cancer.

For dose-escalated prostate radiotherapy, we studied the potential for organ at risk (OAR) sparing and compensation of prostate motion with robust plan optimization using the coverage probability (CovP) concept compared to conventional PTV-based IMRT.Material and methods: We evaluated plan quality of CovP-plans for 27 intermediate risk prostate cancer patients treated in a prospective study (78 Gy/39 fractions). Clinical target volume (CTV) and OARs were contoured on three separate CTs to capture movement and deformation. To define the internal target volume (ITV), the union of CTV1-3 was encompassed by an isotropic margin of 7 mm for the planning process. CovP-dose distribution is optimized considering weight factors for IMRT constraints derived from probabilities of systematic organ displacement in the three CTs. CovP-dose volume histograms (DVHs) were compared with additionally calculated conventional PTV-based IMRT plans. PTV-based IMRT was planned on one-single CT with an isotropically expanded CTV to generate the PTV (i.e., CTV1 + 7mm) and was evaluated on the two other CTs.Results: The CovP-concept showed higher robustness in target volume coverage. Target miss was frequently observed with PTV-based IMRT, resulting in cold spots until 70 Gy with the CovP-concept. The target dose at 74 Gy was comparable, while further the dose-escalation (75-78 Gy) was improved with PTV-based IMRT. However, dose-escalation with PTV-based IMRT was associated with increased OAR-doses, especially in high-dose areas.Conclusions: Probabilistic dose-escalated IMRT was feasible in this prospective study. Comparison of the CovP-concept with PTV-based IMRT revealed superiority with regard to target-coverage and sparing of OARs. The CovP-concept implements a robust plan optimization strategy for organ deformation and motions and could, therefore, serve as a less demanding compromise on the way to adaptive IGRT avoiding daily time-consuming re-planning. SUMMARYWe evaluated the robustness of coverage probability (CovP)-based IMRT plans within a prospective study for prostate cancer radiotherapy. The treatment plans were compared with newly calculated conventional PTV-based IMRT plans. We were able to show that CovP led to a clearly more robust target coverage by avoiding hot spots at OARs compared to conventional PTV-based IMRT. In addition, negative consequences of an inflated PTV can be ameliorated by a more relaxed CovP-based dose prescription.""","""['Zoulikha Outaggarts', 'Daniel Wegener', 'Bernhard Berger', 'Daniel Zips', 'Frank Paulsen', 'Martin Bleif', 'Daniela Thorwarth', 'Markus Alber', 'Oliver Dohm', 'Arndt-Christian Müller']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Prospective evaluation of probabilistic dose-escalated IMRT in prostate cancer.', 'Dosimetric Evaluation of Incorporating Patient Geometric Variations Into Adaptive Plan Optimization Through Probabilistic Treatment Planning in Head and Neck Cancers.', 'PTV-based IMPT optimization incorporating planning risk volumes vs robust optimization.', 'Robust optimization in lung treatment plans accounting for geometric uncertainty.', 'IMRT for prostate cancer: defining target volume based on correlated pathologic volume of disease.', 'Positron emission tomography guided dose painting by numbers of lung cancer: Alanine dosimetry in an anthropomorphic phantom.', 'Prospective evaluation of probabilistic dose-escalated IMRT in prostate cancer.']"""

CK2 is elevated in numerous types of cancer cells, and CK2 suppression of apoptosis represents a key link to the cancer cell phenotype. CK2 regulation of cell survival and death involves diverse processes, and our previous work suggested that mitochondrial machinery is a key locus of this function. One of the earliest responses of prostate cells to inhibition of CK2 is a change in mitochondrial membrane potential, possibly associated with Ca2+ signaling. Thus, in the present work, we investigated early impact of CK2 on intracellular Ca2+ dynamics. Three prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines, PC3-LN4, C4-2B, and 22Rv1, were studied. PCa cells were treated with the CK2 small molecule inhibitors 4,5,6,7-tetrabrombenzotriazole and CX-4945 followed by analysis of Ca2+ levels in various cellular compartments over time. The results showed dose-dependent loss in cytosolic Ca2+ levels starting within 2 min and reaching maximal loss within 5-10 min. There was a concomitant increase in Ca2+ in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial compartments. The results suggest that inhibition of CK2 activity results in a rapid movement of Ca2+ out of the cytosol and into the ER and mitochondria, which may be among the earliest contributory factors for induction of apoptosis in cells subjected to inhibition of CK2. In cells with death-inducing levels of CK2 inhibition, total cellular Ca2+ levels dropped at 2 h post-treatment. These novel observations represent a potential mechanism underlying regulation of cell survival and death by CK2 activity.""","""['Muhammad Afzal', 'Betsy T Kren', 'A Khaliq Naveed', 'Janeen H Trembley', 'Khalil Ahmed']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Cell Biochem""","""['Protein kinase CK2 - diverse roles in cancer cell biology and therapeutic promise.', 'Protein kinase CK2 inhibition induces cell death via early impact on mitochondrial function.', 'Role of protein kinase CK2 in the regulation of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Induction of apoptosis by antisense CK2 in human prostate cancer xenograft model.', 'CK2 inhibition protects white matter from ischemic injury.', 'Genome-wide kinase-MAM interactome screening reveals the role of CK2A1 in MAM Ca2+ dynamics linked to DEE66.', 'CRAC and SK Channels: Their Molecular Mechanisms Associated with Cancer Cell Development.', 'Protein kinase CK2 - diverse roles in cancer cell biology and therapeutic promise.', 'CK2 and the Hallmarks of Cancer.', 'Silmitasertib-induced macropinocytosis promoting DDP intracellular uptake to enhance cell apoptosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma.']"""

Methods:   1545 men undergoing prostate biopsies in a Taiwanese tertiary medical center between 2012 and 2019 were identified retrospectively. A five-fold cross-validated logistic regression risk model was created to calculate the probabilities of PCa and high-grade PCa (Gleason score ≧ 7), to compare those of the Rotterdam and Coral apps. Discrimination was analyzed using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). Calibration was graphically evaluated with the goodness-of-fit test. Decision-curve analysis was performed for clinical utility. At different risk thresholds to biopsy, the proportion of biopsies saved versus low- and high-grade PCa missed were presented.  Results:   Overall, 278/1309 (21.2%) patients were diagnosed with PCa, and 181 out of 278 (65.1%) patients had high-grade PCa. Both our model and the Rotterdam app demonstrated better discriminative ability than the Coral app for detection of PCa (AUC: 0.795 vs 0.792 vs 0.697, DeLong's method: P < 0.001) and high-grade PCa (AUC: 0.869 vs 0.873 vs 0.767, P < 0.001). Using a ≥ 10% risk threshold for high-grade PCa to biopsy, our model could save 67.2% of total biopsies; among these saved biopsies, only 3.4% high-grade PCa would be missed.  Conclusion:   Our new logistic regression model, similar to the Rotterdam app, outperformed the Coral app in the prediction of PCa and high-grade PCa.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying sulforaphane-mediated autophagy, which is protective against apoptotic cell death by this phytochemical, is still poorly understood. This study demonstrates a role for lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2) in sulforaphane-mediated autophagy and apoptosis. Western blotting revealed dose-dependent induction of LAMP2 protein after treatment with sulforaphane as well as its naturally occurring analogs in PC-3 and 22Rv1 human prostate cancer cell lines that was confirmed by microscopy (sulforaphane). The mRNA level of LAMP2 was also increased upon treatment with sulforaphane in both cell lines.

Apoptosis induction by sulforaphane treatment was also increased significantly by knockdown of the LAMP2 protein in PC-3 and 22Rv1 cells. Augmentation of sulforaphane-mediated apoptosis by RNAi of LAMP2 was accompanied by induction and activation of proapoptotic protein Bak. Oral administration of sulforaphane to TRAMP mice also resulted in induction of LAMP2 protein expression. Targeted microarray in sulforaphane-treated PC-3 cells revealed induction of many autophagy-related genes (e.g., HSP90AA1, NRF2, etc) and their expression positively correlated with that of LAMP2 in prostate cancer The Cancer Genome Atlas. In conclusion, this study reveals that induction of LAMP2 by sulforaphane inhibits its ability to induce apoptotic cell death at least in human prostate cancer cells.""","""['Eun-Ryeong Hahm', 'Krishna B Singh', 'Su-Hyeong Kim', 'Anna A Powolny', 'Shivendra V Singh']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Prev Res (Phila)""","""['Sulforaphane and Its Protective Role in Prostate Cancer: A Mechanistic Approach.', 'CXCR4 is a novel target of cancer chemopreventative isothiocyanates in prostate cancer cells.', 'Functional relevance of D,L-sulforaphane-mediated induction of vimentin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Prostate cancer chemoprevention by sulforaphane in a preclinical mouse model is associated with inhibition of fatty acid metabolism.', 'Molecular changes associated with the anticancer effect of sulforaphane against Ehrlich solid tumour in mice.', 'Sulforaphane and Its Protective Role in Prostate Cancer: A Mechanistic Approach.', 'Molecular Pathways Related to Sulforaphane as Adjuvant Treatment: A Nanomedicine Perspective in Breast Cancer.', 'Brazilian Berry Extract Differentially Induces Inflammatory and Immune Responses in Androgen Dependent and Independent Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'The Potential Role of Exosomal Proteins in Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate cancer: Therapeutic prospect with herbal medicine.']"""

Moreover, new diagnostic tests and treatment technologies are expected to further increase the overall costs. Our aims were (i) to estimate the societal costs for existing testing, diagnosis, management and treatment of prostate cancer, and (ii) to provide reference values for future cost-effectiveness analyses of prostate cancer screening and treatment.  Methods:   Taking a societal perspective, this study aimed to investigate the annual cost of prostate cancer in Sweden using a prevalence-based cost-of-illness approach. Resource utilisation and related costs within Stockholm Region during 2016 were quantified using data from the Stockholm PSA and Biopsy Register and other health and population registers. Costs included: (i) direct medical costs for health care utilisation at primary care, hospitals, palliative care and prescribed drugs; (ii) informal care; and (iii) indirect costs due to morbidity and premature mortality. The resource utilisation was valued using unit costs for direct medical costs and the human capital method for informal care and indirect costs. Costs for the Stockholm region were extrapolated to Sweden based on cancer prevalence and the average costs by age and resource type.  Results:   The societal costs due to prostate cancer in Stockholm in 2016 were estimated to be €64 million Euro (€Mn), of which the direct medical costs, informal care and productivity losses represented 62, 28 and 10% of the total costs, respectively. The total annual costs extrapolated to Sweden were calculated to be €281 Mn. The average direct medical cost, average costs for informal care and productivity losses per prevalent case were €1510, €828 and €271, respectively. These estimates were sensitive to assumptions related to the proportion of primary care visits associated with PSA testing and the valuation method for informal care.  Conclusion:   The societal costs due to prostate cancer were substantial and constitute a considerable burden to Swedish society. Data from this study are relevant for future cost-effectiveness evaluations of prostate cancer screening and treatment.""","""['Shuang Hao', 'Ellinor Östensson', 'Martin Eklund', 'Henrik Grönberg', 'Tobias Nordström', 'Emelie Heintz', 'Mark Clements']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Health Serv Res""","""['The societal cost of schizophrenia in Sweden.', 'The economic burden of human papillomavirus-related precancers and cancers in Sweden.', 'Incremental Costs for Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis in a Population-based Cohort in Southern Sweden: Is It All Psoriasis-attributable Morbidity?', 'Cost-effectiveness analysis of schizophrenic patient care settings: impact of an atypical antipsychotic under long-acting injection formulation.', 'Direct and indirect costs associated with respiratory allergic diseases in Italy.

Radiotherapy itself is an additional risk factor for cancer development and the SPCs appearing beyond 5 years after radiotherapy in the original treatment field can be considered as radiation-induced subsequent primary cancers (RISPCs).  Methods:   During the years 1999-2008, 241 patients with localized PCa who underwent low dose-rate brachytherapy (LDR-BT) with I125 and were followed-up in Kuopio University Hospital, were included in this study. In this study the incidences and types of SPCs and RISPCs with a very long follow-up time after LDR-BT were evaluated.  Results:   During the median follow-up time of 11.4 years, a total of 34 (14.1%) patients developed a metachronous SPC. The most abundant SPCs were lung and colorectal cancers, each diagnosed in six patients (16.7% out of all SPCs). The crude incidence rate of RISPC was 1.7% (n = 4). Half of the SPC cases (50%) were diagnosed during the latter half of the follow-up time as the risk to develop an SPC continued throughout the whole follow-up time with the actuarial 10-year SPC rate of 7.0%. The crude death rates due to metachronous out-of-field SPCs and RISPCs were 50 and 50%, respectively.  Conclusion:   The crude rate of SPC was in line with previously published data and the incidence of RISPC was very low.

The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of PSA screening in Asian men using real-world data over a period of 15 years after introducing population screening in Yokosuka City, Japan.  Methods:   We investigated patients with pathologically diagnosed prostate cancer at four hospitals and two clinics across the Yokosuka area (Miura peninsula) between April 2001 and March 2015. Patients were divided into two groups; the S group consisted of those diagnosed by PSA-based population screening in Yokosuka City and the NS group consisted of those diagnosed by methods other than screening. Cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test to compare survival between the two groups. Clinical and pathological factors for cancer-specific mortality were assessed with Cox regression analyses to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).  Results:   A total of 3094 patients had been diagnosed with prostate cancer over the 15-year period. The median follow-up period was 77 months. The S group and the NS group consisted of 977 and 2117 patients, respectively. Patients in the S group were younger (age: 71 years vs 73 years, P < .001) and had a lower Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) with favorable oncological factors, such as lower initial PSA, Gleason score (GS), and risk category. Kaplan-Meier curves for OS and CSS revealed significant differences between the two groups (OS: P < .001, CSS: P < .001). Analysis with Cox proportional hazards model indicated the NS group (HR: 1.584, 95% CI, 1.065-2.356, P = .023), a CCI > 4 (HR: 1.552, 95% CI, 1.136-2.120, P = .006), a GS ≥ 8 (HR: 4.869, 95% CI, 2.631-9.001, P < .001), and nonlocalized cancer (locally advanced; HR: 2.632, 95% CI, 1.676-4.133, P < .001, advanced; HR: 9.468, 95% CI, 6.279-14.278, P < .001) as independent risk factors for cancer-specific mortality.

A better understanding about their associated factors may help to achieve improvements on this area. The aims of this study were to investigate the association between demographic and clinical characteristics and hospitalizations, as well as between these characteristics and the length of stay (LOS), within the first year of outpatient treatment, for the most incident cancers in the Brazilian population. In this cohort study, we investigated 417,477 patients aged 19 years or more, who started outpatient cancer treatment, from 2010-2014, for breast, prostate, colorectal, cervix, lung and stomach cancers. The outcomes evaluated were: i) Hospitalizations within the first year of outpatient cancer treatment; and ii) LOS of the hospitalized patients. It was performed a binary logistic regression to evaluate the association between the explanatory variables and the hospitalizations and a negative binomial regression to evaluate their influence on the length of hospital stay. The hospitalizations occurred for 34% of patients, with a median of LOS of 6 days (IQR: 2-15). Female patients were 16% less likely to be hospitalized (OR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.82-0.86), with lower average of LOS (AR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.97-0.99), each additional year of age reduced in 2% the hospitalization odds (OR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.98-0.99) and in 1% the average of LOS (AR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.98-0.99), patients from South region had twice more chances of hospitalization than from North region (OR: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.93-2.10) and patients with colorectal cancer had greater probability of hospitalization (OR: 4.42; 95% CI: 4.27-4.48), with the highest average of LOS (AR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.35-1.40).

We identify morbidity trends and regional differences in England for all-cancer and type-specific incidence between 1981 and 2016. We use Bayesian modelling to estimate cancer morbidity incidence at various age, year, gender, and region levels. Our analysis shows increasing trends in most rates and marked regional variations that also appear to intensify through time in most cases. All-cancer rates have increased significantly, with the highest increase in East, North West and North East. The absolute difference between the rates in the highest- and lowest-incidence region, per 100,000 people, has widened from 39 (95% CI 33-45) to 86 (78-94) for females, and from 94 (85-104) to 116 (105-127) for males. Lung cancer incidence for females has shown the highest increase in Yorkshire and the Humber, while for males it has declined in all regions with the highest decrease in London. The gap between the highest- and lowest-incidence region for females has widened from 47 (42-51) to 94 (88-100). Temporal change in in bowel cancer risk is less manifested, with regional heterogeneity also declining. Prostate cancer incidence has increased with the highest increase in London, and the regional gap has expanded from 33 (30-36) to 76 (69-83). For breast cancer incidence the highest increase has occurred in North East, while the regional variation shows a less discernible increase. The analysis reveals that there are important regional differences in the incidence of all-type and type-specific cancers, and that most of these regional differences become more pronounced over time. A significant increase in regional variation has been demonstrated for most types of cancer examined here, except for bowel cancer where differences have narrowed.""","""['Ayşe Arık', 'Erengul Dodd', 'George Streftaris']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Socioeconomic disparities in cancer incidence and mortality in England and the impact of age-at-diagnosis on cancer mortality.', 'Italian cancer figures, report 2012: Cancer in children and adolescents.', 'Variation in incidence of breast, lung and cervical cancer and malignant melanoma of skin by socioeconomic group in England.', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Trends in the prevalence of malignancy among patients admitted with acute heart failure and associated outcomes: a nationwide population-based study.', 'Analysis of spatial and temporal impact differences of birth rate in mainland China.', 'Epidemiological Study of Lung Cancer and Clinical Medication in England from 2001 to 2019.', 'Hormone replacement therapy and cancer survival: a longitudinal cohort study: protocol paper.', 'Socioeconomic disparities in cancer incidence and mortality in England and the impact of age-at-diagnosis on cancer mortality.']"""

Results:   Fatal prostate cancer incidence declined in the US by -7.5% each year and increased in England by 7.7% annually. These trends were primarily driven by locoregional disease in the US and distant disease in England. Black men in both countries had twofold to threefold higher fatal prostate cancer incidence rates, when compared with their white counterparts; however, receipt of radical prostatectomy lessened this disparity.

Following 14 days of induction, micropellets exposed to TGF-β1 alone or TGF-β1 + KGN in combination were larger and produced more glycosominoglycan (GAG) than KGN-only cultures. When TGF-β1 + KGN was used, GAG quantities were similar or slightly greater than the TGF-β1-only cultures, depending on the BMSC donor. BMSC micropellet cultures supplemented with KGN alone contracted in size over the culture period and produced minimal GAG. Indicators of hypertrophy were not mitigated in TGF-β1 + KGN cultures, suggesting that KGN does not obstruct BMSC hypertrophy.

Methods:   We analyzed data from 78 prostate cancer patients who underwent Ga-RM2 (n = 42) or Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-11 (n = 36) PET/MRI. The raw PET data were retrospectively reconstructed using both time-of-flight (TOF)-BSREM with b values of 250, 350, 500, 750, and 1000 and TOF-OSEM. Each reconstruction was reviewed independently by 3 nuclear medicine physicians and scored qualitatively using a Likert scale (1 = poor, 5 = excellent quality). SUV measurements were analyzed as well.  Results:   Fifty-seven lesions were detected (21 on Ga-RM2 and 36 on Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI); SUVmax decreased with the increase of β values for both tracers.

Patients and methods:   The expression differences of miR-219-5p and high mobility group protein A2 (HMGA2) in 30 pairs of PCa tissues and para-carcinoma tissues were detected via quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR), and the difference in miR-219-5p expression in PCa cell lines and normal prostatic epithelial cells was also determined via qRT-PCR. The human PC-3 cells were divided into negative control group and miR-219-5p overexpression group. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) and colony formation assays were adopted to detect the cell proliferative ability, and flow cytometry was applied to determine the cell apoptosis. The expression of apoptosis-related proteins was measured via Western blotting, and the invasive and migratory abilities of the cells were examined through wound-healing and transwell assays. Bioinformatics prediction software and luciferase reporter assay were employed to verify the targets that might be controlled by miR-219-5p. Rescue experiment was conducted to clarify whether the inhibitory effects of miR-219-5p on the growth and metastasis of PC-3 cells depend on the inhibition of HMGA2.  Results:   It was shown in qRT-PCR results that the expression level of miR-219-5p was downregulated remarkably in PCa tissues and cell lines, but overexpressed miR-219-5p could repress the proliferation and promote the apoptosis of PC-3 cells notably. The results of wound-healing and transwell assays indicated that overexpressed miR-219-5p was able to suppress the invasion and metastasis of PC-3 cells. According to Western blotting results, overexpressed miR-219-5p could up-regulate the expressions of pro-apoptotic proteins [Bax, cleaved-caspase-3 and cleaved-poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase (PARP)] and reverse the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of PCa cells. It was predicted via the bioinformatics software that HMGA2 gene might be a target gene of miR-219-5p. The Dual-Luciferase reporter assay confirmed that there was a direct regulatory relationship between miR-219-5p and HMGA2. The rescue experiment manifested that overexpressed HMGA2 could reverse the inhibition of miR-219-5p on the growth and metastasis of PC-3 cells.

The aim of this study was to investigate the functions and mechanism of lnc-SNHG14 in prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   Quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) or Western blot (WB) were performed to detect mRNA expressions of SNHG14 and miR-5590-3p, and the protein levels of Yin Yang-1 (YY1) in prostate cancer tissues, adjacent tissues, and cancer cell lines. The correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlations between SNHG14, miR-5590-3p, and YY1. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to analyze the overall survival for prostate cancer patients. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was performed to measure cell proliferation ability and flow cytometry assay was used to detect cell apoptotic rate. Besides, transwell assay was used to measure cell invasion ability. In addition, WB was performed to measure protein expressions in prostate cancer cell lines. Finally, Luciferase reporter assay was performed to verify the binding sites between SNHG14 and miR-5590-3p, miR-5590-3p, and YY1.  Results:   The results showed that SNHG14 was significantly increased in prostate cancer tissues and prostate cancer cell lines, which were related with advanced stage and poor diagnosis for prostate cancer patients. MiR-5590-3p was reduced in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines, which were negatively correlated with SNHG14. YY1 was found to be increased in prostate cancer tissues, which was negatively correlated with miR-5590-3p and positively correlated with SNHG14. Furthermore, SNHG14 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, and promoted cell apoptosis in DU145 cells. In addition, protein expressions of Cyclin D1, Bcl-2, and N-cadherin were repressed, and the levels of Bax, Cleaved Caspase-3, and E-cadherin were increased. Besides, miR-5590-3p inhibition promoted cell proliferation and invasion, and inhibited apoptosis in DU145 cells. Importantly, Luciferase reporter assay proved that SNHG14 could directly sponge with miR-5590-3p, which could bind with YY1 and regulate the functions of cancer cell. Finally, we proved that SNHG14 regulated cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, and invasion via miR-5590-3p/ YY1 axis in prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Above all, we found that SNHG14 was increased in prostate cancer patients, which was related with future diagnosis for prostate cancer patients.

It is unknown, however, whether these patterns persisted through 2016.  Methods:   Based on the US Cancer Statistics Public Use Research Database, we examined temporal trends in invasive prostate cancer incidence from 2005 to 2016 in men aged 50 years and older stratified by stage (local, regional, and distant), age group (50-74 years and 75 years and older), and race and ethnicity (all races and ethnicities, non-Hispanic Whites, and non-Hispanic Blacks) with joinpoint regression models to estimate annual percent changes. Tests of statistical significance are 2-sided (P < .05).  Results:   For all races and ethnicities combined, incidence for local-stage disease declined beginning in 2007 in men aged 50-74 years and 75 years and older, although the decline stabilized during 2013-2016 in men aged 75 years and older. Incidence decreased by 6.4% (95% CI = 4.9%-9% to 7.9%) per year from 2007 to 2016 in men aged 50-74 years and by 10.7% (95% CI = 6.2% to 15.0%) per year from 2007 to 2013 in men aged 75 years and older. In contrast, incidence for regional- and distant-stage disease increased in both age groups during the study period. For example, distant-stage incidence in men aged 75 years and older increased by 5.2% (95% CI = 4.2% to 6.1%) per year from 2010 to 2016.

Objectives:   To use deep learning algorithms to develop models that perform accurate computational H&E staining of native nonstained prostate core biopsy images and to develop methods for interpretation of H&E staining deep learning models and analysis of computationally stained images by computer vision and clinical approaches.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cross-sectional study used hundreds of thousands of native nonstained RGB (red, green, and blue channel) whole slide image (WSI) patches of prostate core tissue biopsies obtained from excess tissue material from prostate core biopsies performed in the course of routine clinical care between January 7, 2014, and January 7, 2017, at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts. Biopsies were registered with their H&E-stained versions. Conditional generative adversarial neural networks (cGANs) that automate conversion of native nonstained RGB WSI to computational H&E-stained images were then trained. Deidentified whole slide images of prostate core biopsy and medical record data were transferred to Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, for computational research. Results were shared with physicians for clinical evaluations. Data were analyzed from July 2018 to February 2019.  Main outcomes and measures:   Methods for detailed computer vision image analytics, visualization of trained cGAN model outputs, and clinical evaluation of virtually stained images were developed. The main outcome was interpretable deep learning models and computational H&E-stained images that achieved high performance in these metrics.  Results:   Among 38 patients who provided samples, single core biopsy images were extracted from each whole slide, resulting in 102 individual nonstained and H&E dye-stained image pairs that were compared with matched computationally stained and unstained images. Calculations showed high similarities between computationally and H&E dye-stained images, with a mean (SD) structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.902 (0.026), Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.962 (0.096), and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) of 22.821 (1.232) dB. A second cGAN performed accurate computational destaining of H&E-stained images back to their native nonstained form, with a mean (SD) SSIM of 0.900 (0.030), PCC of 0.963 (0.011), and PSNR of 25.646 (1.943) dB compared with native nonstained images. A single blind prospective study computed approximately 95% pixel-by-pixel overlap among prostate tumor annotations provided by 5 board certified pathologists on computationally stained images, compared with those on H&E dye-stained images. This study also used the first visualization and explanation of neural network kernel activation maps during H&E staining and destaining of RGB images by cGANs. High similarities between kernel activation maps of computationally and H&E-stained images (mean-squared errors <0.0005) provide additional mathematical and mechanistic validation of the staining system.  Conclusions and relevance:   These findings suggest that computational H&E staining of native unlabeled RGB images of prostate core biopsy could reproduce Gleason grade tumor signatures that were easily assessed and validated by clinicians. Methods for benchmarking, visualization, and clinical validation of deep learning models and virtually H&E-stained images communicated in this study have wide applications in clinical informatics and oncology research. Clinical researchers may use these systems for early indications of possible abnormalities in native nonstained tissue biopsies prior to histopathological workflows.""","""['Aman Rana', 'Alarice Lowe', 'Marie Lithgow', 'Katharine Horback', 'Tyler Janovitz', 'Annacarolina Da Silva', 'Harrison Tsai', 'Vignesh Shanmugam', 'Akram Bayat', 'Pratik Shah']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['An artificial intelligence algorithm for prostate cancer diagnosis in whole slide images of core needle biopsies: a blinded clinical validation and deployment study.', 'Generative adversarial network based digital stain conversion for generating RGB EVG stained image from hyperspectral H&E stained image.', 'Comparison of deep learning models for digital H&E staining from unpaired label-free multispectral microscopy images.', 'Recent Advances of Deep Learning for Computational Histopathology: Principles and Applications.', 'Multi-modality artificial intelligence in digital pathology.', 'The effect of neural network architecture on virtual H&E staining: Systematic assessment of histological feasibility.', 'Classifying Malignancy in Prostate Glandular Structures from Biopsy Scans with Deep Learning.', 'Bioimaging of Dissolvable Microneedle Arrays: Challenges and Opportunities.', 'Prostate cancer histopathology using label-free multispectral deep-UV microscopy quantifies phenotypes of tumor aggressiveness and enables multiple diagnostic virtual stains.', 'Construction of Sports Training Performance Prediction Model Based on a Generative Adversarial Deep Neural Network Algorithm.']"""

Abnormally high expression/activity of AKR1C3 can promote castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). A mansonone derivative and AKR1C3 inhibitor, 6e, was combined with 4D5 (extracellular fragment of the monoclonal antibody of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2)-modified chitosan to achieve a nanodrug-delivery system (CS-4D5/6e) to treat CRPC.  Materials and methods:   Morphologies/properties of CS-4D5/6e were characterized by atomic force microscopy, zeta-potential analysis, and Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy. CS-4D5/6e uptake was measured by immunofluorescence under confocal laser scanning microscopy. Testosterone in LNCaP cells overexpressing human AKR1C3 (LNCaP-AKR1C3) and cell lysates was measured to reflect AKR1C3 activity. Androgen receptor (AR) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) expression was measured by Western blotting. CS-4D5/6e-based inhibition of AKR1C3 was evaluated in tumor-xenografted mice.  Results:   CS-4D5/6e was oblate, with a particle size of 200-300 nm and thickness of 1-5 nm. Zeta potential was 1.39±0.248 mV. 6e content in CS-4D5/6e was 7.3±1.4% and was 18±3.6% for 4D5. 6e and CS-4D5/6e inhibited testosterone production significantly in a concentration-dependent manner in LNCaP-AKR1C3 cells, and a decrease in expression of AKR1C3, PSA, and AR was noted. Half-maximal inhibitory concentration of CS-4D5/6e on LNCaP-AKR1C3 cells was significantly lower than that in LNCaP cells (P<0.05). CS-4D5/6e significantly reduced growth of 22Rv1 tumor xenografts by 57.00% compared with that in the vehicle group (P<0.01).  Conclusion:   We demonstrated the antineoplastic activity of a potent AKR1C3 inhibitor (6e) and its nanodrug-delivery system (CS-4D5/6e). First, CS-4D5/6e targeted HER2-positive CRPC cells. Second, it transferred 6e (an AKR1C3 inhibitor) to achieve a reduction in intratumoral testosterone production. Compared with 6e, CS-4D5/6e showed lower systemic toxicity. CS-4D5/6e inhibited tumor growth effectively in mice implanted with tumor xenografts by downregulating testosterone production mediated by intratumoral AKR1C3. These results showed a promising strategy for treatment of the CRPC that develops invariably in prostate-cancer patients.""","""['Meng Zhou#', 'Xiaoyu Wang#', 'Jie Xia', 'Yating Cheng', 'Lichun Xiao', 'Yu Bei', 'Jianzhong Tang', 'Yadong Huang', 'Qi Xiang', 'Shiliang Huang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Nanomedicine""","""['AKR1C3 Inhibitor KV-37 Exhibits Antineoplastic Effects and Potentiates Enzalutamide in Combination Therapy in Prostate Adenocarcinoma Cells.', 'Mesoporous silica nanoparticles combined with AKR1C3 siRNA inhibited the growth of castration-resistant prostate cancer by suppressing androgen synthesis in\xa0vitro and in\xa0vivo.', 'Steroidogenic enzyme AKR1C3 is a novel androgen receptor-selective coactivator that promotes prostate cancer growth.', 'Aldo-Keto Reductase (AKR) 1C3 inhibitors: a patent review.', 'AKR1C3 as a target in castrate resistant prostate cancer.', 'Inhibition of castration-resistant prostate cancer growth by genistein through suppression of AKR1C3.', 'Dysregulated androgen synthesis and anti-androgen resistance in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Functionalized Selenium Nanotherapeutics Synergizes With Zoledronic Acid to Suppress Prostate Cancer Cell Growth Through Induction of Mitochondria-Mediated Apoptosis and Cell Cycle S Phase Arrest.']"""

Lutetium-177-prostate-specific membrane antigen (Lu-PSMA), a radiolabeled small molecule, binds with high affinity to prostate-specific membrane antigen, enabling beta particle therapy targeted to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). In a recent single-arm phase II trial and a subsequent expansion cohort, a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline of ≥50% was observed in approximately 60% of patients receiving Lu-PSMA. Taking into account the specific challenges and potential toxicities of Lu-PSMA administration in elderly men, we sought to retrospectively analyze the safety and activity of Lu-PSMA in men aged older than 75 years with mCRPC.  Patients and methods:   The electronic medical records of 24 patients aged older than 75 years treated with Lu-PSMA ""off-trial"" were reviewed, and clinical data were extracted. Clinical endpoints were toxicity and activity, defined as a PSA decline ≥50%. Descriptive statistics were performed using Excel.  Results:   The median age at treatment start was 81.7 years (range 75.1-91.9). The median number of previous treatment lines was four. The number of treatment cycles ranged from one to four; the mean administered radioactivity was 6 GBq per cycle. Treatment was generally tolerable; side effects included fatigue (n = 8, 33%), anemia (n = 7, 29%), thrombocytopenia (n = 5, 21%), and anorexia/nausea (n = 3, 13%). Clinical benefit was observed in 12 of 22 patients (54%); PSA decline above 50% was observed in 11 patients (48%) and was associated with significantly longer overall survival.  Conclusion:   Our results indicate that Lu-PSMA is safe and active in elderly patients with mCRPC.  Implications for practice:   Lutetium-177-prostate-specific membrane antigen (Lu-PSMA), a radiolabeled small molecule, binds with high affinity to prostate-specific membrane antigen, enabling beta particle therapy targeted to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

Recently, the studies have revealed that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in the development and progression of cancers including prostate cancer. The present study aims to identify a novel lncRNA that correlated with the survival time of prostate cancer patients and try to explore its biological functions in prostate cancer cells. After analysing the prostate carcinoma dataset of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the lncRNA FAM66C was screened with its expression highly correlated with patient survival time, tumour stage and Gleason pattern. Real-time PCR showed that FAM66C highly expressed in prostate cancer cells, and knockdown FAM66C by siRNAs resulted in significant inhibition of cell growth. Furthermore, the results indicated that FAM66C promoted cell growth due to increasing cell proliferation but not decreasing cell apoptosis. In addition, FAM66C activated the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signalling to promote cell proliferation. The result of Western Blotting and lysosomal acidity detection showed that knockdown FAM66C increased the protein ubiquitination and the lysosomal acidity. Moreover, inhibition of proteasome pathway could increase the activation of EGFR-ERK signalling and cell proliferation. Taken together, these results suggested that lncRNA FAM66C activate EGFR-ERK signalling to promote cell proliferation by inhibiting proteasome pathway in prostate cancer. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: We demonstrated that lncRNA FAM66C was associated with clinical progression. In addition, highly expressed lncRNA FAM66C in prostate cancer cell lines promoted cell proliferation. Moreover, lncRNA FAM66C activate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signalling to promote cell proliferation by inhibiting proteasome pathway in prostate cancer.

The present study was designed to define the safety and initial response to a minimal effective injected activity/cycle of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in mCRPC patients. New protective agents for salivary glands and kidney were co-administered and dosimetry was carried out.  Patients and methods:   A prospective single-arm, open label phase II study on mCRPC was activated at our institute in April 2017. Patients with histologically confirmed advanced mCRPC previously treated with standard life-prolonging agents were enrolled. Folic polyglutamate tablets were orally administered as parotid gland protectors and 500 mL of a 10% mannitol solution was intravenously infused to reduce kidney uptake before the injection of 3.7-5.5 GBq of 177Lu-PSMA-617 repeated four times at interval of 8 weeks. The adsorbed dose calculation was performed with MIRD formalism (OLINDA/EXM software). The Bryant and Day design was used to estimate the sample size taking account of both activity and toxicity.  Results:   Forty-three eligible patients were evaluated for toxicity and initial response. Dosimetry was carried out in 13 patients. Two (4.8%) patients had G3 and 8 (19.5%) had G2 hematological toxicity. Only 3 (6.9%) patients had mild G1 salivary gland toxicity and 8 (19.5%) had G1 renal toxicity. A decrease of ≥ 30% in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was achieved after the first cycle in 17 (40.5%) patients, of whom 13 had a PSA decline of >50% after the second cycle. The median adsorbed doses were 0.65 mGy/MBq (range 0.33-2.63) for parotid glands, 0.42 mGy/MBq (0.14-0.81) for kidneys, 0.036 mGy/MBq (0.023-0.067) for red marrow, and 0.038 mGy/MBq (0.018-0.135) for the whole body.  Conclusion:   In advanced, heavily pre-treated mCRPC patients, 3.7 GBq/cycle of 177Lu-PSMA-617 was safe and produced early biochemical and imaging responses at PSMA whole-body scan post injection. Dosimetry of salivary glands suggests that the co-administration of polyglutamate tablets may reduce salivary gland uptake.

It is important for surgeons to identify the prostate during TaTME to prevent UI occurrence; intraoperative image navigation could be considered useful in this regard. This study aims at developing a deep learning model for real-time automatic prostate segmentation based on intraoperative video during TaTME. The proposed model's performance has been evaluated.  Methods:   This was a single-institution retrospective feasibility study. Semantic segmentation of the prostate area was performed using a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach. DeepLab v3 plus was utilized as the CNN model for the semantic segmentation task. The Dice coefficient (DC), which is calculated based on the overlapping area between the ground truth and predicted area, was utilized as an evaluation metric for the proposed model.  Results:   Five hundred prostate images were randomly extracted from 17 TaTME videos, and the prostate area was manually annotated on each image. Fivefold cross-validation tests were performed, and as observed, the average DC value equaled 0.71 ± 0.04, the maximum value being 0.77. Additionally, the model operated at 11 fps, which provides acceptable real-time performance.  Conclusions:   To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first effort toward realization of computer-assisted TaTME, and results obtained in this study suggest that the proposed deep learning model can be utilized for real-time automatic prostate segmentation. In future endeavors, the accuracy and performance of the proposed model will be improved to enable its use in practical applications, and its capability to reduce UI risks during TaTME will be verified.""","""['Daichi Kitaguchi', 'Nobuyoshi Takeshita', 'Hiroki Matsuzaki', 'Hiro Hasegawa', 'Ryoya Honda', 'Koichi Teramura', 'Tatsuya Oda', 'Masaaki Ito']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Surg Endosc""","""['Deep learning-based automatic surgical step recognition in intraoperative videos for transanal total mesorectal excision.', 'Real-time vascular anatomical image navigation for laparoscopic surgery: experimental study.', 'Combined Transfer Learning and Test-Time Augmentation Improves Convolutional Neural Network-Based Semantic Segmentation of Prostate Cancer from Multi-Parametric MR Images.', 'Application of semantic segmentation based on convolutional neural network in medical images.', 'High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC)-Based Surgical Telementoring System Using Shallow Convolutional Neural Network.', 'Automatic Surgical Skill Assessment System Based on Concordance of Standardized Surgical Field Development Using Artificial Intelligence.', 'Deep-learning-based semantic segmentation of autonomic nerves from laparoscopic images of colorectal surgery: an experimental pilot study.', 'Computer-aided anatomy recognition in intrathoracic and -abdominal surgery: a systematic review.', 'Essential updates 2020/2021: Current topics of simulation and navigation in hepatectomy.', 'Artificial intelligence-based computer vision in surgery: Recent advances and future perspectives.']"""

Recently, the efficacy of an endoscopic down-to-up rectal dissection was reported. Here, we present a safe and simple technique for anterior dissection using a simultaneous laparoscopic and transperineal endoscopic approach.  Methods:   We perform transperineal APR (TpAPR) using both the laparoscopic and transperineal approach (a 2-team approach). Anterior dissection commences just behind the superficial transverse perineal muscle. Next, the striated muscle complex surrounding the rectum (levator ani and puborectalis muscle) is divided. At this point, it is difficult to identify the dissection plane between the membranous urethra and anterior rectum; thus, dissection along the lateral aspect of neurovascular bundle from the lateral to anterior side with the assistance of the laparoscopic team is helpful in identifying the posterior surface of the prostate. Once the prostate is identified, it is relatively easy to divide the rectourethralis muscles. The key steps of our procedure are shown in the video.  Results:   Between April 2016 and July 2019, we performed 14 TpAPR procedures in male patients with rectal cancer without distant metastasis. Extended surgery was performed in 8 patients, including pelvic sidewall dissection and combined resection of adjacent organs. Median operative time was 453 min and median blood loss was 46 g. There was 1 (7.1%) circumferential-positive case, but no cases of urethral injury or rectal perforation.

Despite these advances, resistance occurs frequently and there is currently no definitive cure for castration-resistant prostate cancer. Our previous studies identified that similar mechanisms of resistance to enzalutamide or abiraterone occur following treatment and cross-resistance exists between these therapies in advanced prostate cancer. Here, we show that enzalutamide- and abiraterone-resistant prostate cancer cells are further cross-resistant to apalutamide and darolutamide. Mechanistically, we have determined that the AKR1C3/AR-V7 axis confers this cross-resistance. Knockdown of AR-V7 in enzalutamide-resistant cells resensitize cells to apalutamide and darolutamide treatment. Furthermore, targeting AKR1C3 resensitizes resistant cells to apalutamide and darolutamide treatment through AR-V7 inhibition. Chronic apalutamide treatment in C4-2B cells activates the steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway and increases AKR1C3 expression, which confers resistance to enzalutamide, abiraterone, and darolutamide. In conclusion, our results suggest that apalutamide and darolutamide share similar resistant mechanisms with enzalutamide and abiraterone.

This study aimed to assess the expression and function of MAPT in prostate cancer (CaP).  Methods:   The expression of MAPT was determined using immunohistochemistry in CaP. We analyzed the interaction between MAPT, Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog (PTEN), and androgen receptor and investigated the role of MAPT in bicalutamide resistance.  Results:   Immunohistochemistry in 155 CaP cases showed that 15% of them were positive for MAPT. High MAPT expression was significantly orrelated with high Gleason score and high T stage. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the high MAPT expression was significantly associated with poor prostate-specific antigen recurrence survival after radical prostatectomy. There was an inverse correlation between MAPT and PTEN. In the CaP cell lines, knockout of PTEN increased the expression of MAPT, whereas knockdown of MAPT suppressed the expression of androgen receptor and increased the sensitivity to bicalutamide. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining of MAPT showed that high MAPT expression was significantly associated with poor overall survival in 74 CaP patients who were treated with androgen deprivation therapy.

Objective:   To determine trends in the utilization of palliative interventions among patients with advanced bladder, prostate, and kidney cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients from years 2004 to 2013 in the National Cancer Database diagnosed with stage IV bladder (n = 17,997), prostate (n = 23,322), and kidney (n = 34,697) cancer, after excluding those with missing disease stage, treatment, and outcomes data.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were performed to evaluate utilization of palliative care intervention. Utilization was analyzed by cancer type and by overall survival strata (<6, 6-24, and >24 months). Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models analyzed overall survival.  Results and limitations:   Palliative interventions were utilized in 12.5% (2,257/17,997), 14.7% (3,442/23,322), and 19.9% (6,935/34,697) of advanced bladder, prostate, and kidney cancer patients, respectively. Older age and longer survival were associated with lower odds of palliative intervention utilization in each malignancy, as was minority race in kidney and bladder cancer patients. Palliative radiation was used most commonly, and utilization of any palliative intervention was associated with poorer overall survival. Limitations largely stem from imperfect data abstraction, and the analysis of interventions' incomplete reflection of palliative care.  Conclusions:   Palliative interventions were seldom used among patients with advanced urologic malignancies. Palliative interventions were less frequently used in older patients and minority races.

Although several treatment options exist, their clinical effectiveness is still not satisfactory. One the possible reason of such situation might be the presence of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and their pro-tumorigenic activity. MDSC possess immunosuppressive ability and in many studies were shown to support tumor development and progression. In this study we addressed the question whether commonly used therapies of prostate cancer affect the level of MDSC populations in the patients' blood. We compared the level of granulocytic (Gr-MDSC), monocytic (Mo-MDSC) and early stage MDSC (eMDSC) in the blood of patients at different clinical stage and different tumor grading scores, who underwent either surgery or hormonal therapy alone or were given a combined treatment, including e.g. radiotherapy. The obtained results showed that the level of Gr-MDSC was significantly lower in all treated patients comparing to untreated group. On the other hand, surgery or hormonal therapy alone did not affect the level of Mo-MDSC. These results were independent of the PSA level, the tumor grading and clinical stage of the patients.

Knockdown of OGFRP1 inhibited the growth of PCa cells, suggesting a promotional effect of OGFRP1 in tumor progression.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of a novel exosomal vaccine (interferon-γ [IFN-γ]-modified exosomal vaccine) in prostate cancer.  Methods:   Prostate cancer cell-derived exosomes were used to prepare the exosomal vaccine using our protein-anchoring technique. The immunogenicity and therapeutic efficacy of the exosomes was evaluated by measuring the effects of the exosomal vaccine on M1 macrophage differentiation, the ability of macrophages to engulf the exosomes, the production of antibodies against exosomes, and tumor angiogenesis and metastasis, and tumor growth.  Results:   The IFN-γ fusion protein was efficiently anchored on the surface of prostate cancer cell-derived exosomes and retained its bioactivity. The IFN-γ-exosomal vaccine increased the number of M1 macrophages, enhanced the ability of M1 macrophages to engulf RM-1 cell-derived exosomes, and induced the production of specific antibodies against exosomes. The exosomal vaccine downregulated the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 and attenuated the effect of exosomes in promoting tumor metastasis. The proportions of CD4+ , CD8+ , and IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cells in the exosomal vaccine group were the highest among the four groups. Interestingly, the IFN-γ-exosomal vaccine decreased the percentage of Tregs and downregulated the expression of programed death-ligand 1 and indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase 1 in the tumor environment. The exosomal vaccine significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged the survival time of mice with prostate cancer. The exosomal and tumor cell vaccines had a good synergistic effect in promoting tumor immunity.

Objective:   The study aimed to explore user experiences of delivery, design, and structure of iCAN-DO from the perspective of people with cancer.  Methods:   We studied user experiences by interviewing 15 informants individually: 10 women with breast cancer (67%), 4 men with prostate cancer (27%), and 1 man with colorectal cancer (7%) with a mean age 58.9 years (SD 8.9). The interviews focused on informants' perceptions of ease of use and of system design and structure. Informants had been included in iCAN-DO for at least 7 months.

The analysis revealed three subthemes, concerning how user experiences were affected by disease-specific factors and side effects (User experience in the context of cancer), technical problems (Technical struggles require patience and troubleshooting), and the structure and design of iCAN-DO (Appealing and usable, but rather simple).  Conclusions:   The results indicate that user experiences were affected by informants' life situations, the technical aspects and the design of iCAN-DO, and informants' preferences.

Methods and material:   Experimental data with proton beams suggest that relative biological effectiveness increases with linear energy transfer. This relation also depends on the α / β ratio, characteristic of a tissue and a considered endpoint. Three phenomenological models (Carabe et al., Wedenberg et al. and McNamara et al.) are compared to a mechanistic model based on microdosimetry (microdosimetric kinetic model) and to the current assumption of uniform relative biological effectiveness equal to 1.1 in a prostate case.  Results and conclusions:   Phenomenological models clearly predict higher relative biological effectiveness values compared to microdosimetric kinetic model, that seems to approach to the constant value of 1.1 adopted in the clinics, at least for low linear energy transfer values achieved in typical prostate proton plans. All models predict a higher increase of the relative biological effectiveness-weighted dose for the prostate tumor than for the rest of structures involved due to its lower α / β ratio, even when linear energy transfer is, in general, lower in the tumor than on the surroundings tissues. Prostate cancer is, therefore, a good candidate to take advantage of variable relative biological effectiveness, especially if linear energy transfer is enhanced within the tumor. However, the discrepancies among models hinder the clinical implementation of variable relative biological effectiveness.""","""['A Bertolet', 'A Carabe-Fernandez']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Inclusion of a variable RBE into proton and photon plan comparison for various fractionation schedules in prostate radiation therapy.', 'Hydrogel rectum-prostate spacers mitigate the uncertainties in proton relative biological effectiveness associated with anterior-oblique beams.', 'Can We Advance Proton Therapy for Prostate?

Methods:   Pediatric and adult patients with a first cancer diagnosis between 2004 and 2015 who received 3DCRT, IMRT, or PBRT were identified in the National Cancer Database from 9 tumor types: head and neck, gastrointestinal, gynecologic, lymphoma, lung, prostate, breast, bone/soft tissue, and brain/central nervous system. The diagnosis of second cancer was modeled using multivariable logistic regression adjusting for age, follow-up duration, radiotherapy (RT) dose, chemotherapy, sociodemographic variables, and other factors. Propensity score matching also was used to balance baseline characteristics.  Results:   In total, 450,373 patients were identified (33.5% received 3DCRT, 65.2% received IMRT, and 1.3% received PBRT) with median follow-up of 5.1 years after RT completion and a cumulative follow-up period of 2.54 million person-years. Overall, the incidence of second cancer diagnosis was 1.55 per 100 patient-years. In a comparison between IMRT versus 3DCRT, there was no overall difference in the risk of second cancer (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.00; 95% CI, 0.97-1.02; P = .75). By comparison, PBRT had an overall lower risk of second cancer versus IMRT (adjusted OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.26-0.36; P < .0001). Results within each tumor type generally were consistent in the pooled analyses and also were maintained in propensity score-matched analyses.  Conclusions:   The risk of a second cancer diagnosis was similar after IMRT versus 3DCRT, whereas PBRT was associated with a lower risk of second cancer risk.

As analysis methods move toward image-based three-dimensional computation, it becomes important to interpolate and extrapolate these data without requiring manual intervention; that is, in a manner that is highly efficient and reproducible. Iterative least-squares solvers are poorly suited to this task because of the computational overhead and potential to optimize to local minima without applying tight constraints at the outset.  Methodology:   This work describes a fully analytical method for solving three-phase exponential time-activity curves based on three measured time points in a manner that may be readily employed by image-based dosimetry tools. The methodology uses a series of conditional statements and a piecewise approach for solving exponential slope directly through measured values in most instances. The proposed algorithm is tested against a purpose-designed iterative fitting technique and linear piecewise method followed by single exponential in a cohort of ten patients receiving 177 Lu-DOTA-Octreotate therapy.  Results:   Tri-exponential time-integrated values are shown to be comparable to previously published methods with an average difference between organs when computed at the voxel level of 9.8 ± 14.2% and -3.6 ± 10.4% compared to iterative and interpolated methods, respectively. Of the three methods, the proposed tri-exponential algorithm was most consistent when regional time-integrated activity was evaluated at both voxel- and whole-organ levels. For whole-body SPECT imaging, it is possible to compute 3D time-integrated activity maps in <5 min processing time. Furthermore, the technique is able to predictably and reproducibly handle artefactual measurements due to noise or spatial misalignment over multiple image times.  Conclusions:   An efficient, analytical algorithm for solving multiphase exponential pharmacokinetics is reported. The method may be readily incorporated into voxel-dose routines by combining with widely available image registration and radiation transport tools.""","""['Price Jackson', 'Lachlan McIntosh', 'Michael S Hofman', 'Grace Kong', 'Rodney J Hicks']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['DblurDoseNet: A deep residual learning network for voxel radionuclide dosimetry compensating for single-photon emission computerized tomography imaging resolution.', 'Particle filter de-noising of voxel-specific time-activity-curves in personalized 177Lu therapy.', 'Whole-remnant and maximum-voxel SPECT/CT dosimetry in 131 I-NaI treatments of differentiated thyroid cancer.', 'Improved dosimetry for targeted radionuclide therapy using nonrigid registration on sequential SPECT images.', 'Radionuclide therapy: current status and prospects for internal dosimetry in individualized therapeutic planning.', 'Patient-specific dosimetry adapted to variable number of SPECT/CT time-points per cycle for Formula: see textLu-DOTATATE therapy.']"""

The prediction of miRNAs associated with underlying diseases via computational approaches is beneficial to identify biomarkers and discover specific medicine, which can greatly reduce the cost of diagnosis, cure, prognosis, and prevention of human diseases. However, how to further achieve a more reliable prediction of potential miRNA-disease associations with effective integration of different biological data is a challenge for researchers. In this study, we proposed a computational model by using a federated method of combined multiple-similarities fusion and space projection (MSFSP). MSFSP firstly fused the integrated disease similarity (composed of disease semantic similarity, disease functional similarity, and disease Hamming similarity) with the integrated miRNA similarity (composed of miRNA functional similarity, miRNA sequence similarity, and miRNA Hamming similarity). Secondly, it constructed the weighted network of miRNA-disease associations from the experimentally verified Boolean network of miRNA-disease associations by using similarity networks. Finally, it calculated the prediction results by weighting miRNA space projection scores and the disease space projection scores. Leave-one-out cross-validation demonstrated that MSFSP has the distinguished predictive accuracy with area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.9613 better than that of five other existing models. In case studies, the predictive ability of MSFSP was further confirmed as 96 and 98% of the top 50 predictions for prostatic neoplasms and lung neoplasms were successfully validated by experimental evidences and supporting experimental evidences were also found for 100% of the top 50 predictions for isolated diseases.""","""['Yi Zhang', 'Min Chen', 'Xiaohui Cheng', 'Hanyan Wei']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Front Genet""","""['LSGSP: a novel miRNA-disease association prediction model using a Laplacian score of the graphs and space projection federated method.', 'HNMDA: heterogeneous network-based miRNA-disease association prediction.', 'An improved random forest-based computational model for predicting novel miRNA-disease associations.', 'MicroRNAs and complex diseases: from experimental results to computational models.', 'A Computational Model to Predict the Causal miRNAs for Diseases.', 'Predicting potential miRNA-disease associations based on more reliable negative sample selection.', 'A message passing framework with multiple data integration for miRNA-disease association prediction.', 'SCMFMDA: Predicting microRNA-disease associations based on similarity constrained matrix factorization.', 'A novel miRNA-disease association prediction model using dual random walk with restart and space projection federated method.', 'Predicting Metabolite-Disease Associations Based on LightGBM Model.']"""

Thus, the evaluation of prognosis is crucial for clinical treatment decision of human PCa patients. We aim to establishing an effective and reliable model to predict the outcome of PCa patients.  Methods:   We first identified differentially expressed genes between prostate cancer and normal prostate in TCGA-PRAD and then performed WGCNA to initially identify the candidate Gleason score related genes. Then, the candidate genes were applied to construct a LASSO Cox regression analysis model. Numerous independent validation cohorts, time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC), univariate cox regression analysis, nomogram were used to test the effectiveness, accuracy and clinical utility of the prognostic model. Furthermore, functional analysis and immune cells infiltration were performed.  Results:   Gleason score-related differentially expressed candidates were identified and used to build up the outcome model in TCGA-PRAD cohort and was validated in MSKCC cohort. We found the 3-gene outcome model (CDC45, ESPL1 and RAD54L) had good performance in predicting recurrence free survival, metastasis free survival and overall survival of PCa patients. Time-dependent ROC and nomogram indicated an ideal predictive accuracy and clinical utility of the outcome model. Moreover, outcome model was enriched in 28 pathways by GSVA and GSEA. In addition, the risk score was positively correlated with memory B cells, native CD4 T cells, activated CD4 memory T cells and eosinophil, and negatively correlated with plasma cells, resting CD4 memory T cells, resting mast cells and neutrophil.

Results:   During the first 3 years on AS, men experienced decreased anxiety, avoidance thoughts/behaviors, and fight-against-cancer attitudes, and these changes were found to be statistically significant. When considering clinically significant changes between inclusion in AS (T0) and 3-year follow-up (T4), avoidance decreased in 19% of patients.  Conclusions:   Most patients were observed to have adopted functional coping strategies at baseline, which were maintained through the first 3 years on AS.

We examined cancer incidence, screening eligibility, and receipt of screening among persons actively enrolled in the DC Cohort, a longitudinal observational cohort of PLWH, between 2011 and 2017. Cancer screening eligibility was determined based on age, sex, smoking history and co-morbidity data available and published national guidelines. The incidence rate of NADCs was 12.1 (95% CI 10.7, 13.8) and ADCs 1.6 (95% CI 0.6, 4.6) per 1000 person-years. The most common incident NADCs were breast 2.6 (95% CI 0.5,1 2.1), prostate 2.3 (95% CI 1.2, 4.3), and non-melanoma skin 1.2 (95% CI 0.6, 2.3) incident diagnoses/cases per 1000 person-years. Among cohort sites where receipt of cancer screening was assessed, less than 60% of eligible participants had any ascertained anal HPV, breast, cervical, colorectal, hepatocellular carcinoma, or lung cancer screening. In this cohort of PLWH, there were more incident NADCs versus ADCs in contrast to earlier cohort studies where ADCs predominated. Despite a large eligible population there were low rates of screening.

There are several radionuclide techniques for imaging PCa skeletal metastases. We aimed to compare the lesion detection rate of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, [68Ga]Ga-NODAGA-zoledronate ([68Ga]Ga-NODAGAZOL) PET/CT, and [99mTc]Tc-MDP bone scan in the assessment of bone metastases in patients with advanced PCa.  Methods:   We prospectively recruited two cohorts of patients (staging and re-staging cohorts) with advanced prostate cancer. The staging cohort was treatment-naïve PCa patients who showed skeletal metastases on bone scan. These patients were subsequently imaged with [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and [68Ga]Ga-NODAGAZOL PET/CT. Re-staging cohort was patients who were previously treated with PSMA-based radioligand therapy and were experiencing PSA progression. The re-staging cohort was imaged with [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and [68Ga]Ga-NODAGAZOL PET/CT. We performed a per-patient and per-lesion analysis of skeletal metastases in both cohorts and made a comparison between scan findings.  Results:   Eighteen patients were included with a median age of 68 years (range = 48-80) and a median Gleason score of 8. There were ten patients in the staging cohort with a median PSA of 119.26 ng/mL (range = 4.63-18,948.00) and eight patients in the re-staging cohort with a median PSA of 48.56 ng/mL (range = 6.51-3175.00). In the staging cohort, skeletal metastases detected by [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, [68Ga]Ga-NODAGAZOL PET/CT, and bone scan were 322, 288, and 261, respectively, p = 0.578. In the re-staging cohort, [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and [68Ga]Ga-NODAGAZOL PET/CT detected 152 and 191 skeletal metastases, respectively, p = 0.529. In two patients with negative [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT findings, [68Ga]Ga-NODAGAZOL detected one skeletal metastasis in one patient and 12 skeletal metastases in the other.  Conclusion:   In patients with advanced prostate cancer, [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT may detect more lesions than [68Ga]Ga-NODAGAZOL PET/CT and [99mTc]Tc-MDP bone scan for the staging of skeletal metastases. In patients who experience PSA progression on PSMA-based radioligand therapy, [68Ga]Ga-NODAGA PET/CT is a more suitable imaging modality for the detection of skeletal lesions not expressing PSMA.

Genetic variation in metformin metabolism pathways appears to modify metformin glycemic control and the protective association with some cancers. However, no studies to date have examined this pharmacogenetic interaction and prostate cancer chemoprevention.  Methods:   Clinical data and germline DNA were collected from our prostate biopsy database between 1996 and 2014. In addition to a genome-wide association study (GWAS), 27 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) implicated in metformin metabolism were included on a custom SNP array. Associations between metformin use and risk of high-grade (Grade Group ≥ 2) and overall prostate cancer were explored using a case-control design. Interaction between the candidate/GWAS SNPs and the metformin-cancer association was explored using a case-only design.  Results:   Among 3481 men, 132 (4%) were taking metformin at diagnosis. Metformin users were older, more likely non-Caucasian, and had higher body mass index, Gleason score, and number of positive cores. Overall, 2061 (59%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer, of which 922 (45%) were high-grade. After adjusting for baseline characteristics, metformin use was associated with higher risk of high-grade prostate cancer (OR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.1-2.9, p = 0.02) and overall prostate cancer (OR = 1.77, 95% CI 1.1-2.9, p = 0.03). None of the 27 candidate SNPs in metformin metabolic pathways had significant interaction with the metformin-cancer association. Among the GWAS SNPs, one SNP (rs149137006) had genome-wide significant interaction with metformin for high-grade prostate cancer, and another, rs115071742, for overall prostate cancer. They were intronic and intergenic SNPs, respectively, with largely uncharacterized roles in prostate cancer chemoprevention.  Conclusions:   In our cohort, metformin use was associated with increased risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer. While SNPs involved in metformin metabolism did not have modifying effects on the association with disease risk, one intronic and one intergenic SNP from the GWAS study did, and these require further study.""","""['Min Joon Lee', 'Viranda H Jayalath', 'Wei Xu', 'Lin Lu', 'Stephen J Freedland', 'Neil E Fleshner', 'Girish S Kulkarni', 'Antonio Finelli', 'Theodorus H van der Kwast', 'Robert J Hamilton']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Letter to the Editor: ""Association between metformin medication, genetic variation and prostate cancer risk""-genotyping and patient categorizations, do they matter?', 'Response to the Letter to the Editor: ""Association between metformin medication, genetic variation and prostate cancer risk""-genotyping and patient categorization, do they matter?', 'Characterizing associations and SNP-environment interactions for GWAS-identified prostate cancer risk markers--results from BPC3.', 'Polymorphisms of Genes Involved in Glucose and Energy Metabolic Pathways and Prostate Cancer: Interplay with Metformin.', 'A polymorphism in the promoter of FRAS1 is a candidate SNP associated with metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Genome-wide Scan Identifies Role for AOX1 in Prostate Cancer Survival.', 'A systematic review of replication studies of prostate cancer susceptibility genetic variants in high-risk men originally identified from genome-wide association studies.', 'Effects of metformin and statins on outcomes in men with castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer: Secondary analysis of COU-AA-301 and COU-AA-302.', 'Targeting of the tumor immune microenvironment by metformin.', 'Metformin and Malignant Tumors: Not Over the Hill.', 'Isolation and characterization of castration-resistant prostate cancer LNCaP95 clones.']"""

In total, 303 prostate cancer patients were included, consisting of 84 control (alpha-blocker naïve), 72 tamsulosin and 147 prazosin patients. The main outcomes measured were relapse rates (%), time to biochemical relapse (months) and PSA velocity (ng/mL/year). Recurrence free survival was calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Prazosin significantly reduced biochemical relapse at both two and five-years (2.72%, 8.84%) compared to control (22.61%, 34.52%). Recurrence free survival was also significantly higher in the prazosin group. This remained after multivariable analysis (HR: 0.09, 95% CI: 0.04-0.26, p < 0.001). Patients receiving prazosin had a 3.9 times lower relative risk of biochemical relapse compared to control. Although not statistically significant, tamsulosin and prazosin extended recurrence free survival by 13.15 and 9.21 months respectively.

However, not all patients respond, and resistance mechanisms are largely unknown. We hypothesized that genomic and transcriptional features from metastatic CRPC biopsies prior to treatment would be predictive of de novo treatment resistance. To this end, we conducted a phase II trial of enzalutamide treatment (160 mg/d) in 36 men with metastatic CRPC. Thirty-four patients were evaluable for the primary end point of a prostate-specific antigen (PSA)50 response (PSA decline ≥50% at 12 wk vs. baseline). Nine patients were classified as nonresponders (PSA decline <50%), and 25 patients were classified as responders (PSA decline ≥50%). Failure to achieve a PSA50 was associated with shorter progression-free survival, time on treatment, and overall survival, demonstrating PSA50's utility. Targeted DNA-sequencing was performed on 26 of 36 biopsies, and RNA-sequencing was performed on 25 of 36 biopsies that contained sufficient material. Using computational methods, we measured AR transcriptional function and performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to identify pathways whose activity state correlated with de novo resistance. TP53 gene alterations were more common in nonresponders, although this did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.055). AR gene alterations and AR expression were similar between groups. Importantly, however, transcriptional measurements demonstrated that specific gene sets-including those linked to low AR transcriptional activity and a stemness program-were activated in nonresponders.

The relative influence of host immunocompetence versus microbiological virulence factors in the acquisition and outcome of bloodstream infections (BSI) is poorly understood. Herein, we used whole-genome sequencing on 278 blood culture isolates of ESBL/pAmpC-EC from 260 patients with community-onset BSI collected from 2012 to 2015 in Stockholm to study the association of virulence genes, sequence types, and antimicrobial resistance with severity of disease, infection source, ESBL/pAmpC-EC BSI low-risk patients, and patients with repeated episodes. ST131 subclade C2 comprised 29% of all patients. Factors associated with septic shock in multivariable analysis were patient host factors (hematologic cancer or transplantation and reduced daily living activity), presence of the E. coli virulence factor iss (increased serum survival), absence of phenotypic multidrug resistance, and absence of the genes pap and hsp Adhesins, particularly pap, were associated with urinary tract infection (UTI) source, while isolates from post-prostate biopsy sepsis had a low overall number of virulence operons, including adhesins, and commonly belonged to ST131 clades A, B, and subclade C1, ST1193, and ST648.

This study describes changes in adherence to medications for treating three common chronic conditions - diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension - among older adults newly diagnosed with non-metastatic breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer.  Methods:   We identified Medicare beneficiaries aged ≥66 years newly diagnosed with cancer and using medication for at least one chronic condition, and similar cohorts of matched individuals without cancer. To assess medication adherence, proportion of days covered (PDC) was measured in six-month windows starting six-months before through 24 months following cancer diagnosis or matched index date. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate difference-in-differences (DID) comparing changes in PDCs across cohorts using the pre-diagnosis window as the referent. Analyses were run separately for each cancer type-chronic condition combination.  Results:   Across cancer types and non-cancer cohorts, adherence was highest for anti-hypertensives (90-92%) and lowest for statins (77-79%). In older adults with colorectal and lung cancer, adherence to anti-diabetics and statins declined post-diagnosis compared with the matched non-cancer cohorts, with estimates ranging from a DID of -2 to -4%. In older adults with breast and prostate cancer cohorts, changes in adherence for all medications were similar to non-cancer cohorts.  Conclusion:   Our findings highlight variation in medication adherence by cancer type and chronic condition. As many older adults with early stage cancer eventually die from non-cancer causes, it is imperative that cancer survivorship interventions emphasize medication adherence for other chronic conditions.""","""['Jennifer L Lund', 'Parul Gupta', 'Krutika B Amin', 'Ke Meng', 'Benjamin Y Urick', 'Katherine E Reeder-Hayes', 'Joel F Farley', 'Stephanie B Wheeler', 'Lisa Spees', 'Justin G Trogdon']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Geriatr Oncol""","""[""Providers' mediating role for medication adherence among cancer survivors."", 'Association of Changes in Medication Use and Adherence With Accountable Care Organization Exposure in Patients With Cardiovascular Disease or Diabetes.', 'Association between dispensing channel and medication adherence among medicare beneficiaries taking medications to treat diabetes, high blood pressure, or high blood cholesterol.', 'Effects of breast cancer on chronic disease medication adherence among older women.', 'Changes in Medication Management After a Diagnosis of Cancer Among Medicare Beneficiaries With Diabetes.', 'Cardiometabolic Comorbidities in Cancer\xa0Survivors: JACC: CardioOncology State-of-the-Art Review.', ""Providers' mediating role for medication adherence among cancer survivors."", 'Research priorities to address polypharmacy in older adults with cancer.']"""

The immediate (concomitant) use of ADT in this clinical setting potentially augments the efficacy of SBRT by improving systemic disease control. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of these two treatment strategies.  Materials and methods:   Eighty-eight patients with up to three oligometastases and controlled primary disease who had been treated using SBRT with immediate or delayed ADT were included in this retrospective analysis. Progression-free survival (PFS), widespread failure-free survival (WFFS) and freedom from further interventions (FFFI) were assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard regression methods. Toxicity was evaluated using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0.  Results:   Thirty-nine patients (44.3%) were treated with SBRT and immediate ADT (continuous ADT, n = 7; intermittent ADT, n = 32) and 49 (55.7%) with SBRT and delayed ADT. The median follow-up was 24 months (interquartile range 13.5-37.0 months). PFS in the immediate and delayed ADT groups were 26 months and 16 months, respectively (P < 0.007). The median WFFS in the immediate ADT group was not reached compared with 21 months in the delayed ADT group (P = 0.025). The 1- and 2-year FFFI in the immediate ADT group were 88% and 64.1%, respectively, significantly higher than those in the delayed ADT group (63.8% and 30.2%, respectively, P < 0.002). Acute toxicities of grade 1-2 occurred in 17.9% of the immediate ADT group and 18.4% of the delayed ADT group (P = 0.96).

To the best of our knowledge, we report on a unique case of a pure xanthoma without benign prostatic hyperplasia of the prostate in a patient with lower urinary tract symptoms manifested after kidney transplantation.  Methods:   A 62-year-old man was submitted for a kidney transplant in April 2018. He had no urinary complaints previous to the transplant. Since July 2019, he had complained of lower urinary tract symptoms. In October 2019, he had acute urinary retention being submitted to a transurethral resection of an estimated 47 g prostate. All measures of cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) were within the normal range-except triglycerides, which were mildly elevated in 2 measures.  Results:   The pathologic examination of the resected prostate showed pure xanthoma without benign prostatic hyperplasia. A similar lesion with a xanthomatous cell component is verruciform xanthoma. It is a rare benign lesion of unknown etiology not associated with underlying disorders of lipid metabolism that has been reported in patients with bone marrow, kidney, and liver transplant.  Conclusions:   We report a unique case of prostate enlargement caused by pure xanthoma in a patient with renal transplant. In absence of any apparent infection, normal cholesterol measures, and appearance of symptoms after the transplant and considering the morphologic similarity with verruciform xanthoma, a lesion also reported in transplanted patients, we speculate that the pathogenesis of the lesion in this particular patient may be related to immunosuppression.""","""['Athanase Billis', 'Leandro L L Freitas', 'Larissa B E Costa', 'Icléia S Barreto', 'Amanda A R Botega', 'Thairo A Pereira', ""Carlos A D'Ancona""]""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Transplant Proc""","""['Anal verruciform xanthoma in a transplant background for primary hyperoxaluria.

Understanding how these PC subtypes vary in their striving for energy and anabolic molecules is of fundamental importance for developing more effective therapies and diagnostics. Here, we carried out an extensive analysis of prostate tissue samples to reveal metabolic alterations during PC development and disease progression and furthermore between TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement-positive and -negative PC subclasses.  Methods:   Comprehensive metabolomics analysis of prostate tissue samples was performed by non-destructive high-resolution magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (1H HR MAS NMR). Subsequently, samples underwent moderate extraction, leaving tissue morphology intact for histopathological characterization. Metabolites in tissue extracts were identified by 1H/31P NMR and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). These metabolomics profiles were analyzed by chemometric tools and the outcome was further validated using proteomic data from a separate sample cohort.  Results:   The obtained metabolite patterns significantly differed between PC and benign tissue and between samples with high and low Gleason score (GS). Five key metabolites (phosphocholine, glutamate, hypoxanthine, arginine and α-glucose) were identified, who were sufficient to differentiate between cancer and benign tissue and between high to low GS. In ERG-positive PC, the analysis revealed several acylcarnitines among the increased metabolites together with decreased levels of proteins involved in β-oxidation; indicating decreased acyl-CoAs oxidation in ERG-positive tumors. The ERG-positive group also showed increased levels of metabolites and proteins involved in purine catabolism; a potential sign of increased DNA damage and oxidative stress.  Conclusions:   Our comprehensive metabolomic analysis strongly indicates that ERG-positive PC and ERG-negative PC should be considered as different subtypes of PC; a fact requiring different, sub-type specific treatment strategies for affected patients.""","""['Ilona Dudka', 'Elin Thysell', 'Kristina Lundquist', 'Henrik Antti', 'Diego Iglesias-Gato', 'Amilcar Flores-Morales', 'Anders Bergh', 'Pernilla Wikström', 'Gerhard Gröbner']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Integration of tissue metabolomics, transcriptomics and immunohistochemistry reveals ERG- and gleason score-specific metabolomic alterations in prostate cancer.', 'Expression of steroid and peptide hormone receptors, metabolic enzymes and EMT-related genes in prostate tumors in relation to the presence of the TMPRSS2/ERG fusion.', 'Concurrent TMPRSS2-ERG and SLC45A3-ERG rearrangements plus PTEN loss are not found in low grade prostate cancer and define an aggressive tumor subset.', 'Translational Metabolomics of Head Injury: Exploring Dysfunctional Cerebral Metabolism with Ex Vivo NMR Spectroscopy-Based Metabolite Quantification.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Differences in the metabolomic profile of the human palatine tonsil between pediatrics and adults.', 'Underlying Features of Prostate Cancer-Statistics, Risk Factors, and Emerging Methods for Its Diagnosis.', 'Study on potential markers for diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma by serum untargeted metabolomics based on UPLC-MS/MS.', 'Molecular and metabolic alterations of 2,3-dihydroquinazolin-4(1H)-one derivatives in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Metabolic pathways enriched according to ERG status are associated with biochemical recurrence in Hispanic/Latino patients with prostate cancer.']"""

The aim of this study was to assess the effects of exercise-conditioned human serum (HS) effects on the proliferative and tumorigenic potential of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and prostate cancer (PC) cells. Moreover, modulated mechanisms and several physiological factors that can predict exercise effects were investigated.  Methods:   Thirty healthy sedentary subjects were recruited for the study. The subjects performed two high-intensity endurance cycling (HIEC) sessions before and after a nine-week period of high-intensity interval training (HIIT). Cell tumorigenic capacity affected by HS collected before (t0), immediately after (t1), 4 h (t2), and 24 h (t3) after the HIEC sessions was evaluated by in vitro three-dimensional colony formation. The modulation of molecular pathways was analyzed by western blotting and qPCR in TNBC and PC cells, and in TNBC xenografts in exercised mice.  Results:   All of the HIEC-conditioned HS (t1, t2, and t3) markedly impacted the proliferative and the microtumor-forming capacity of both TNBC and PC cell lines, while the HS collected from the subjects at rest did not. Modulation of the Hippo and Wnt/β-catenin pathways by HIEC-conditioned HS before and after the period of HIIT was shown. Multiple linear regression analysis showed relationships between the effects of HIEC-conditioned HS in PC cells, lactate threshold and VO2max.

SHC SH2-domain-binding protein 1 (SHCBP1) has been identified frequently upregulated in various cancers, in addition to PCa. The aims of this study were to determine the relationships between SHCBP1 and clinicopathological characteristics of PCa and to explore the role of SHCBP1 in PCa proliferation and progression.  Methods:   Tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry were used to determine the prognostic significance of SHCBP1. The relationship between clinicopathological characteristics of PCa and SHCBP1 was then analyzed using Cox regression analyses. To investigate SHCBP1 functions in vitro and in vivo, we knocked down SHCBP1 in PCa cell lines and established xenograft mice models. A series of cytological function assays were utilized to determine the role of SHCBP1 in cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis.  Results:   SHCBP1 was significantly upregulated in PCa tissues compared with BPH tissues. Patients with a higher expression of SHCBP1 were associated with poor survival outcomes than those with a lower expression of SHCBP1. Lentivirus-mediated shRNA knockdown of SHCBP1 in prostate cancer cell lines diminished cell growth, migration, and invasion dramatically both in vitro and in vivo, accompanied by an enhanced expression of large tumor suppressor 1 (LATS1) and tumor protein P53 (TP53) and inhibition of MDM2 proto-oncogene (MDM2), which suggested that SHCBP1 may promote proliferation and invasion in vitro via the LATS1-MDM2-TP53 pathway. The results of cycloheximide (CHX) and MG-132 assays indicated that SHCBP1 knockdown could attenuate the degradation of TP53 by the proteasome, prolong the half-life of TP53, and enhance the stabilization of TP53.  Conclusion:   These findings suggest that SHCBP1 overexpression contributes to PCa progression and that targeting SHCBP1 might be therapeutically beneficial to patients with PCa.""","""['Ning Xu', 'Yu-Peng Wu', 'Hu-Bin Yin', 'Shao-Hao Chen', 'Xiao-Dong Li', 'Xue-Yi Xue', 'Xin Gou']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['SHCBP1 promotes synovial sarcoma cell metastasis via targeting TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway and is associated with poor prognosis.', 'MicroRNA-340 inhibits prostate cancer cell proliferation and metastasis by targeting the MDM2-p53 pathway.', 'SHCBP1 promotes cisplatin induced apoptosis resistance, migration and invasion through activating Wnt pathway.', 'Biological functions and therapeutic potential of SHCBP1 in human cancer.', 'The Role of Shcbp1 in Signaling and Disease.', 'Transcriptional immune suppression and upregulation of double stranded DNA damage and repair repertoires in ecDNA-containing tumors.', 'SHCBP1 contributes to the proliferation and self‑renewal of cervical cancer cells and activation of the NF‑κB signaling pathway through EIF5A.', 'Identification of Recurrent Chromosome Breaks Underlying Structural Rearrangements in Mammary Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Identification of SHCBP1 as a potential biomarker involving diagnosis, prognosis, and tumor immune microenvironment across\xa0multiple\xa0cancers.', 'Exploration of Extracellular Vesicle miRNAs, Targeted mRNAs and Pathways in Prostate Cancer: Relation to Disease Status and Progression.']"""

Recent studies have showed that small nucleolar host genes (SNHGs) and their homolog small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) elicit regulatory functions in carcinogenesis. Present study aimed to investigate the role of SNHG17 and its homolog SNORA71B in PC. Function of SNHG17 and SNORA71B in PC is detected by CCK-8, colony formation, flow cytometry analysis of apoptosis, and transwell migration assay. The mechanism whereby SNHG17 regulated SNORA71B was detected by RIP, pulldown, ChIP, and luciferase reporter assays. Results depicted that transcript 6 of SNHG17 and SNORA71B were upregulated in PC. Knockdown of SNHG17 or SNORA71B weakened proliferation, invasion, migration, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and strengthened apoptosis. Mechanistically, SNHG17 and SNORA71B were transcriptionally activated by signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A (STAT5A). SNHG17 positively regulated SNORA71B in PC cell lines and other cell lines. SNHG17 sponged miR-339-5p to upregulate STAT5A and therefore to cause transactivation of SNORA71B. Rescue experiments delineated that SNORA71B was required for the regulation of SNHG17 on PC. Moreover, SNHG17 silence hindered tumorigenesis of PC in vivo. In conclusion, current study first revealed that lncRNA SNHG17 aggravated prostate cancer progression through regulating its homolog SNORA71B via a positive feedback loop, which might do help to the pursuit of better PC treatment.""","""['Gaoliang Wu', 'Chao Hao', 'Xueliang Qi', 'Jianqiang Nie', 'Weimin Zhou', 'Ji Huang', 'Qiuming He']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Enabling factor for cancer hallmark acquisition: Small nucleolar RNA host gene 17.', 'SNHG17 promotes colorectal tumorigenesis and metastasis via regulating Trim23-PES1 axis and miR-339-5p-FOSL2-SNHG17 positive feedback loop.', 'SNHG17 upregulates WLS expression to accelerate lung adenocarcinoma progression by sponging miR-485-5p.', 'Long non-coding RNA PCAT-1 contributes to tumorigenesis by regulating FSCN1 via miR-145-5p in prostate cancer.', 'Long noncoding RNA SNHG17: a novel molecule in human cancers.', 'RNA-seq analysis identifies transcriptomic profiles associated with anal cancer recurrence among people living with HIV.', 'Importance of long non-coding RNAs in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of prostate cancer.', ""C/D box small nucleolar RNA SNORD104 promotes endometrial cancer by regulating the 2'-O-methylation of PARP1."", 'Prognostic significance of lncRNA AP004608.1 in prostate cancer.', 'Enabling factor for cancer hallmark acquisition: Small nucleolar RNA host gene 17.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 2909 patients who underwent surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) from January 2008 to June 2018. A total of 1362 patients received HoLEP, and 1547 patients received TURP. The baseline patient characteristics were collected. We then compared the perioperative outcomes of these patients who diagnosed with incidentally diagnosed prostatic carcinoma (IDPC) or PCa after BPH surgeries.  Results:   The total detection rate of PCa in HoLEP group was higher than that in TURP group (85/6.24% vs. 61/3.94%, p = 0.005). Specifically, 55(4.6%) patients were diagnosed with IDPC in HoLEP group with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) less than 4 ng/ml, and 37(2.7%) patients in TURP group (p = 0.014). For the patients with PSA between 4 and 10 ng/ml, 15(13.9%) patients were diagnosed with PCa after HoLEP, and 6(5.0%) patients after TURP (p = 0.023). But the detection rate of PCa was not significantly different between the two groups when PSA was over 10 ng/ml. On the other hand, 57 in 1215 patients with no prostate biopsy preoperatively were diagnosed with PCa after HoLEP, while 42 in 1370 patients after TURP (4.7% vs. 3.1%, p = 0.040), respectively. Twenty-six patients received once biopsy and diagnosed with PCa in HoLEP group, while 15 patients in TURP group (18.4% vs. 8.9%, p = 0.018), respectively.

Understanding the mechanism of prostate cancer heterogeneity is essential for developing effective therapies. In this study, we reported the heterogeneous activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in prostate cancer. We developed a Wnt/β-catenin signaling reporting system to directly characterize the differences between Wnt/β-catenin signaling active (GFP+) and inactive (GFP-) cells. Compared to GFP- cells, GFP+ cells demonstrated cancer stem cell properties with higher colony formation efficiency, slower cell cycle, higher resistance to docetaxel and higher expression of cancer stem cell markers. In addition, we found that Wnt/β-catenin signaling is negatively correlated with H3K27me3 levels. Further studies demonstrated that Wnt/β-catenin signaling affected H3K27me3 levels by regulating the expression of KDM6A, one of the H3K27me3 demethylases. H3K27me3 suppressed Wnt/β-catenin signaling by directly silencing LEF1 promoter. Together, our studies suggest that Wnt/β-catenin signaling makes a major contribution to prostate cancer heterogeneity and targeting both Wnt/β-catenin signaling active and inactive populations is essential for developing more effective therapies.""","""['Fan Wang', 'Yuli Zhu', 'Fang Wang', 'Yanqing Wang', 'Bai-Jun Dong', 'Naitao Wang', 'Wei-Qiang Gao']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""[]"""

The stable cell line of LNCaP cells infected with LV3-shRNA-PCGEM1 was successfully constructed. In addition, LV3-shRNA-PCGEM1 was able to increase the baicalein-induced inhibitory effects on LNCaP cells, and the susceptibility was 2.3 fold higher than that of baicalein alone. LV3-shRNA-PCGEM1 combined with baicalein also inhibited the colony formation, increased G2 and S phase cells, inhibited the expression of PCGEM1, and induced autophagy of LNCaP cells. In summary, LV3-shRNA-PCGEM1 may improve the sensitivity of LNCaP cells to baicalein, and the molecular mechanism may be associated with the decrease of PCGEM1 expression and the induction of autophagy.

This might be a long drawn process and we need to have policies in place, to be able to fight both, the SARS-CoV-2 virus and cancer, simultaneously, and emerge triumphant. An extensive literature search for impact of delay in management of various urological malignancies was carried out. Expert opinions were sought wherever there was paucity of evidence, in order to reach a consensus and come up with recommendations for directing uro-oncology services in the times of COVID-19. The panel recommends deferring treatment of patients with renal cell carcinoma by 3 to 6 months, except for those with ongoing hematuria and/or inferior vena cava thrombus, which warrant immediate surgery. Metastatic renal cell cancers should be started on targeted therapy. Low grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancers can be kept on active surveillance while high risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancers and muscle invasive bladder cancers should be treated within 3 months. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be avoided. Management of low and intermediate risk prostate cancer can be deferred for 3 to 6months while high risk prostate cancer patients can be initiated on neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy. Patients with testicular tumors should undergo high inguinal orchiectomy and be treated according to stage without delay, with stage I patients being offered surveillance. Penile cancers should undergo penectomy, while clinically negative groins can be kept on surveillance. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be avoided and adjuvant therapy should be deferred.

Methods:   A 12-question survey was created in Survey Monkey®. The survey was e-mailed to Society of Skeletal Radiology (SSR) members on September 19, 2018. The survey included questions on SSR member demographics and on their experience with WBMRI.  Results:   One hundred sixty-four of 1454 (11%) SSR members responded to the survey. A minority (32%; n = 52/164) of respondents reported that their institutions routinely perform WBMRI. The most common indication was multiple myeloma (78%, n = 51/65). The most commonly utilized sequences were coronal short tau inversion recovery (STIR) (79%, n = 52/66) and coronal T1 without fat saturation (73%, n = 48/66). A large proportion of respondents (48%, n = 31/64) did not know the code used for billing WBMRI at their institutions.

Conclusion:   There is variation in who is responsible for the protocol and interpretation of WBMRI, as well as how the exam is performed and how the exam is coded, which raise barriers to broad implementation.

We investigated the role of spirometry in a community-based lung cancer screening programme.  Methods:   Ever smokers, age 55-74, resident in three deprived areas of Manchester were invited to a 'Lung Health Check' (LHC) based in convenient community locations. Spirometry was incorporated into the LHCs alongside lung cancer risk estimation (Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Study Risk Prediction Model, 2012 version (PLCOM2012)), symptom assessment and smoking cessation advice. Those at high risk of lung cancer (PLCOM2012 ≥1.51%) were eligible for annual low-dose CT screening over two screening rounds. Airflow obstruction was defined as FEV1/FVC<0.7. Primary care databases were searched for any prior diagnosis of COPD.  Results:   99.4% (n=2525) of LHC attendees successfully performed spirometry; mean age was 64.1±5.5, 51% were women, 35% were current smokers. 37.4% (n=944) had airflow obstruction of which 49.7% (n=469) had no previous diagnosis of COPD. 53.3% of those without a prior diagnosis were symptomatic (n=250/469). After multivariate analysis, the detection of airflow obstruction without a prior COPD diagnosis was associated with male sex (adjOR 1.84, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.47; p<0.0001), younger age (p=0.015), lower smoking duration (p<0.0001), fewer cigarettes per day (p=0.035), higher FEV1/FVC ratio (<0.0001) and being asymptomatic (adjOR 4.19, 95% CI 2.95 to 5.95; p<0.0001).

Methods: The study included 691 consecutive newly diagnosed, biopsy-proven, treatment-naïve, D'Amico high-risk PCa patients primary-staged by 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT. PSMA SUVmax and metastatic findings were compared with prostate-specific antigen level, International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade, and clinical stage as traditional risk stratification parameters. Moreover, 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT findings were compared with histology findings in radical prostatectomy patients undergoing PLND. Undetected lymph node metastases (LNMs) underwent immunohistochemical PSMA staining. Results: Advanced disease (N1/M1) was observed in 35.3% of patients (244/691) and was associated with increasing prostate-specific antigen level, ISUP grade, and clinical stage. LNMs (N1/M1a) were detected in 31.4% (217/691) and bone metastases (M1b) in 16.8% (116/691). Advanced disease frequencies in patients with ISUP grades 2 and 3 were 10.8% (11/102) and 37.1% (33/89), respectively. Risk of advanced disease for cT2a, cT2b, and cT2c tumors was almost equal (24.2%, 27.9%, and 22.4%, respectively). We observed a weak correlation between SUVmax and biopsy ISUP grade (ρ = 0.21; P < 0.001) and a modest correlation between SUVmax and postprostatectomy ISUP grade (ρ = 0.38; P < 0.001). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and accuracy for LNM detection on 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in the PLND cohort were 30.6%, 96.5%, 68.8%, 84.5%, and 83.1%, respectively. Undetected LNMs either were micrometastases located in the lymph node border or were without PSMA expression. Conclusion: In this high-risk PCa cohort, we identified advanced disease in about one third at diagnosis. ISUP grade was the superior predictor for advanced disease at diagnosis. We found a significant difference in frequency of advanced disease between ISUP grades 2 and 3, as supports the Gleason score 7 subdivision. Interestingly, we observed no significant differences in risk of advanced disease when comparing the different cT2 stages.

Extensive bone involvement is regarded as a risk factor for mCRPC patients treated with 223Ra-dichloride (223Ra). The aim of this study was to quantify 99mTc-DPD uptake by means of SPECT/CT before 223Ra and compare the results with the feasibility of treatment and overall survival (OS). Methods: Sixty consecutive mCRPC patients were prospectively included in this study. SPECT/CT of the central skeleton covering the skull to the mid-femoral level was performed before the first cycle of 223Ra. The bone compartment was defined by means of low-dose CT. Emission data were corrected for scatter, attenuation, and decay supplemented by resolution recovery using dedicated software. The Kaplan-Meier estimator, U test, and Cox regression analysis were used for statistics. Results: Total 99mTc-DPD uptake of the central skeleton varied between 11% and 56% of injected dose (%ID) or between 1.8 and 10.5 %ID/1,000 mL of bone volume (%ID/L). SUVmean ranged from 1.9 to 7.4, whereas the SUVmax range was 18-248. Patients unable to complete 223Ra treatment because of progression and/or cytopenia (n = 23) showed significantly higher uptake (31.9 vs. 25.4 %ID and 6.0 vs. 4.7 %ID/L; P < 0.02). OS after 223Ra (median, 15.2 mo) was reduced to 7.3 mo in cases of skeletal uptake that was 26 %ID or higher, as compared with 30.8 mo if lower than 26 %ID (P = 0.008). Similar results were obtained for %ID/L and SUVmean SUVmax did not correlate with survival. %ID/L was identified as an independent prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio, 1.381 per unit), along with number of previous treatment lines. Conclusion: Quantitative SPECT/CT of bone scans performed at baseline is prognostic for survival in mCRPC patients treated with 223Ra.""","""['Helmut Dittmann', 'Sabine Kaltenbach', 'Matthias Weissinger', 'Francesco Fiz', 'Peter Martus', 'Maren Pritzkow', 'Juergen Kupferschlaeger', 'Christian la Fougère']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Quantitative assessment of 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate bone SPECT/CT for assessing bone metastatic burden and its prognostic value in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancers: initial results in a single-center retrospective study.', 'Quantitative bone SPECT/CT: high specificity for identification of prostate cancer bone metastases.', 'Review of Palliative 223Ra in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Experience at West Virginia University Cancer Center.', 'Optimal usage of radium-223 in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Evaluating radium-223 response in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with imaging.', 'Effect of Gaussian Smoothing Filter Size for CT-Based Attenuation Correction on Quantitative Assessment of Bone SPECT/CT: A Phantom Study.', 'Quantitative assessment of 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate bone SPECT/CT for assessing bone metastatic burden and its prognostic value in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancers: initial results in a single-center retrospective study.', 'Quantification of bone metabolic activity in the natural course of fractural lesions measured by quantitative SPECT/CT.', 'Albumin-Mediated Size Exclusion Chromatography: The Apparent Molecular Weight of PSMA Radioligands as Novel Parameter to Estimate Their Blood Clearance Kinetics.', 'Optimization of SPECT/CT imaging protocols for quantitative and qualitative 99mTc SPECT.']"""

Objective:   To test the effect of systemic therapy (ST) and/or cytoreductive nephrectomy (CNT) on overall mortality (OM) in patients with non-ccmRCC.  Design, setting, and participants:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry (2006-2015), we identified patients with papillary, chromophobe, sarcomatoid, and collecting duct metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Temporal trends (estimated annual percentage change [EAPC]), Kaplan-Meier plots, and multivariable Cox regression models were used.  Results and limitations:   Of 1573 patients with non-ccmRCC, 22%, 25%, 25%, and 28% underwent no treatment, ST, CNT, and CNT with ST, respectively. Between 2006 and 2015, rates of CNT and the combination of CNT and ST decreased (EAPC: -6.3% and -3.2%, respectively). Conversely, rates of no treatment and ST increased over time (EAPC: 4.6% and 7.5%, respectively). In multivariable Cox regression models, relative to no treatment, ST (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.5; p < 0.001), CNT (HR: 0.4; p < 0.001), and CNT with ST (HR: 0.3; p < 0.001) were associated with lower OM. Histological subtypes were associated with OM, relative to papillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC): chromophobe (HR: 0.7; p < 0.01), sarcomatoid (HR: 2.1; p < 0.001), and collecting duct RCC (HR: 1.9; p < 0.001). Limitations include the impossibility to stratify patients according to mRCC risk groups.  Conclusions:   Most non-ccmRCC patients are treated with a combination of CNT and ST or CNT alone or ST alone. The rates of ST alone are increasing. Conversely, the rates of combined CNT and ST and CNT alone are decreasing. These observed temporal patterns of treatment rates are counterintuitive with respect to associated OM benefits, where combination of CNT and ST, as well as CNT alone, resulted in the lowest absolute OM, relative to ST alone, or, even worse, no treatment.

Objective:   To study the impact of in-hospital PP on symptomatic VTE incidence and adverse events after RP at 30 d, with the secondary objective of evaluating overall VTE in a screening subcohort.  Design, setting, and participants:   A prospective, phase 4, single-center, randomized trial of men with prostate cancer undergoing open or robotic-assisted laparoscopic RP was conducted (July 2017-November 2018).  Intervention:   PP (subcutaneous heparin) plus routine care versus routine care alone. The screening subcohort was offered lower extremity duplex ultrasound at 30 d.  Outcomes measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic VTE incidence (pulmonary embolism [PE] or deep venous thrombosis [DVT]). Primary safety outcomes included the incidence of symptomatic lymphocele, hematoma, or bleeding after surgery. Secondary outcomes were overall VTE, estimated blood loss, total surgical drain output, complications, and surveillance imaging bias. Fisher's exact test and modified Poisson regression were performed.  Results and limitations:   A total of 501 patients (75% robotic) were randomized and >99% (500/501) completed follow-up. At second interim analysis (N = 445), the symptomatic VTE rate was 2.3% (four PE + DVT and one DVT) for routine care versus 0.9% (one PE + DVT and one DVT) for PP (relative risk 0.40 [95% confidence interval 0.08-2.03], p = 0.3) meeting a futility threshold for early stopping. In the screening subcohort, the overall VTE rate was 3.3% versus 2.4% (p = 0.7). Results were similar at the final analysis (symptomatic VTE: 2.0% vs 0.8%, p = 0.3; overall VTE: 2.9% vs 2.8%, p = 1). No differences were observed in safety or secondary outcomes. All VTE events (seven symptomatic and three asymptomatic) occurred in patients undergoing pelvic lymph node dissection.  Conclusions:   This study was not able to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in symptomatic VTE associated with PP. There was no increase in the development of symptomatic lymphoceles, bleeding, or other adverse events. Given that the event rate was lower than powered for, further research is needed among high-risk patients (Caprini score ≥8) or patients receiving pelvic lymph node dissection.  Patient summary:   In this report, we randomized patients undergoing radical prostatectomy to perioperative pharmacologic prophylaxis or routine care alone. We found that pharmacologic prophylaxis did not reduce postoperative symptomatic venous thromboembolism significantly for men at routine risk. Importantly, pharmacologic prophylaxis did not increase adverse events, such as formation of lymphoceles or bleeding, and can safely be implemented when indicated for patients with risk factors undergoing radical prostatectomy.""","""['Hiten D Patel', 'Farzana A Faisal', 'Bruce J Trock', 'Gregory A Joice', 'Zeyad R Schwen', 'Phillip M Pierorazio', 'Michael H Johnson', 'Trinity J Bivalacqua', 'Misop Han', 'Michael A Gorin', 'H Ballentine Carter', 'Alan W Partin', 'Christian P Pavlovich', 'Mohamad E Allaf']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Baseline Risks of Venous Thromboembolism and Major Bleeding are Crucial in Decision-making on Thromboprophylaxis.', 'Re: Hiten D.

Results from a Large Multi-institutional Series""","""Focal therapy (FT) for prostate cancer (PCa) is emerging as a novel therapeutic approach for patients with low- to intermediate-risk disease, in order to provide acceptable oncological control, whilst avoiding the side effects of radical treatment. Evidence regarding the ideal follow-up strategy and the significance of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics after treatment is needed. In this study, we aimed to assess the value of the percentage of PSA reduction (%PSA reduction) after FT in predicting the likelihood of any additional treatment or any radical treatment. We retrospectively analysed a multicentre cohort of 703 men receiving FT for low- and intermediate-risk PCa. Overall, the rates of any additional treatment and any radical treatment were 30% and 13%, respectively. The median follow-up period was 41 mo. The median %PSA reduction after FT was 73%. At Cox multivariable analysis, %PSA reduction was an independent predictor of any additional treatment (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.96; p < 0.001) and radical treatment (HR: 0.97; p < 0.001) after FT. For %PSA reduction of>90%, the probability of any additional treatment within 5 yr was 20%. Conversely, for %PSA reduction of <10%, the probability of receiving any additional treatment within 5 yr was roughly 70%. This study is the first to assess the role of %PSA reduction in the largest multicentre cohort of men receiving FT for PCa. Given the lack of standardised follow-up strategies in the FT field, the use of the %PSA reduction should be considered.

Herein, we perform a translational study to investigate the inverse response of serum folate in prostate cancer patients initiating androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and a mirrored animal model.  Methods:   A retrospective study was performed using the South Texas Veterans Healthcare System to identify patients with prostate cancer on ADT. We documented testosterone and folate levels before and after ADT initiation (defined by a reduction in testosterone by 50 ng/ml) as compared to those already on ADT (maintenance). Our primary outcome was overall mortality with secondary outcome of prostate cancer-specific mortality. In parallel, we tested castration of C57BL/6J mice on folate-defined diet to determine if folate levels change with response to androgen deprivation. Students' t test on continuous variables and Chi-squared test on dichotomous variables was performed along with Kaplan-Meier for time to event analysis.  Results:   We identified 56 men with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation in which folate levels had been determined. 15 out of 16 (94%) men initiating ADT had increases in their folate, which is substantially more than 67% in maintenance group (P = 0.04). We identified more rapid time to death from prostate cancer if folate levels increased to levels >200 ng/ml above their baseline (P = 0.03). Mice models demonstrated a significant rise in serum red blood cell folate after mice were castrated (P = 0.03) by an average of 1.5x over pre-castrated baseline level. By contrast, sham-castrated mice showed no increase in serum folate levels over baseline.  Conclusion:   Our study suggests that men with substantial rises in folate after initiating ADT may be associated with worse prostate cancer-specific and overall survival. Our translational experiments in mice confirmed correlation between rising in folate levels post-castration. Given this study, further investigation is warranted on the role of dietary folate consumption during initiation of ADT and progression to castrate-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Michael A Liss', 'Keith Ashcraft', 'Arpan Satsangi', 'Dean Bacich']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Testosterone Recovery Profiles After Cessation of Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Such immune suppression results in uncontrolled tumor growth and mortality. Addressing APC dysfunction, dendritic cell (DC)-mediated anti-tumor vaccination was extensively investigated in both mice and humans. These studies never achieved full resistance to tumor relapse. Herein, we describe a repetitive RM-1 murine tumor rechallenge model for recurrence in humans. Using this newly developed model, we show that priming with tumor antigen-pulsed, Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 ligand-activated DCs elicits a host-protective anti-tumor immune response in C57BL/6 mice. Upon stimulation with the TLR2 ligand peptidoglycan (PGN), the tumor antigen-pulsed DCs induce complete resistance to repetitive tumor challenges. Intra-tumoral injection of PGN reduces tumor growth. The tumor resistance is accompanied by increased expression of interleukin (IL)-27, T-box transcription factor TBX21 (T-bet), IL-12, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interferon (IFN)-γ, along with heightened cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) functions. Mice primed four times with PGN-stimulated tumor antigen-pulsed DCs remain entirely resistant to repeat challenges with RM-1 tumor cells, suggesting complete prevention of relapse and recurrence of tumor. Adoptive transfer of T cells from these mice, which were fully protected from RM-1 rechallenge, confers anti-tumor immunity to syngeneic naive recipient mice upon RM-1 challenge. These observations indicate that PGN-activated DCs induce robust host-protective anti-tumor T cells that completely resist tumor growth and recurrence.""","""['A Patidar', 'S Selvaraj', 'P Chauhan', 'C A Guzman', 'T Ebensen', 'A Sarkar', 'D Chattopadhyay', 'B Saha']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Exp Immunol""","""['The boosting effect of co-transduction with cytokine genes on cancer vaccine therapy using genetically modified dendritic cells expressing tumor-associated antigen.', 'Strategies for antigen loading of dendritic cells to enhance the antitumor immune response.', 'Dendritic cell-tumor cell hybrids enhance the induction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes against murine colon cancer: a comparative analysis of antigen loading methods for the vaccination of immunotherapeutic dendritic cells.', 'Clinically feasible approaches to potentiating cancer cell-based immunotherapies.', 'Dendritic cell-based combined immunotherapy with autologous tumor-pulsed dendritic cell vaccine and activated T cells for cancer patients: rationale, current progress, and perspectives.']"""

Risk distribution was 42.4% favorable, 49.2% intermediate, and 8.4% high-risk. Patients with clinical failure before 3.5 years were excluded. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used with clinical failure (local, distant, regional or biochemical triggering salvage) as an endpoint for each of four PSA categories: PSA ≤ 0.2, >0.2 to ≤0.5, >0.5 to ≤1.0, and >1.0 ng/mL. PSA levels at 4 years (±6 months) in 8746 patients without clinical failure were correlated with disease status at 10-15 years.  Results:   For the 77.1% of patients with 4-year PSA ≤ 0.2, the freedom-from-recurrence (FFR) rates were 98.7% (95% CI 98.3-99.0) at 10 years and 96.1% (95% CI 94.8-97.2) at 15 years.

We examined risks of solid cancers at 16 sites in elderly patients with knee or hip osteoarthritis (KHOA) or ankylosing spondylitis.  Methods:   In this population-based retrospective cohort study, we used US Medicare data from 1999 to 2010 to identify cohorts of persons with KHOA or ankylosing spondylitis, and a general population group without either condition, who were followed through 2015. We compared cancer incidence among groups, adjusted for age, sex, race, socioeconomic characteristics, geographic region, smoking and comorbidities.  Results:   We studied 2 701 782 beneficiaries with KHOA, 13 044 beneficiaries with ankylosing spondylitis, and 10 859 304 beneficiaries in the general population group. Beneficiaries with KHOA had lower risks of cancer of the oropharynx, oesophagus, stomach, colon/rectum, hepatobiliary tract, pancreas, larynx, lung, and ovary than the general population. However, beneficiaries with KHOA had higher risks of melanoma, renal cell cancer, and cancer of the bladder, breast, uterus and prostate. Associations were similar in ankylosing spondylitis, with lower risks of cancer of the oesophagus, stomach, and lung, and higher risks of melanoma, renal cell cancer, and cancer of the renal pelvis/ureter, bladder, breast, and prostate.  Conclusion:   Lower risks of highly prevalent cancers, including colorectal and lung cancer, may explain lower cancer-related mortality in patients with KHOA or ankylosing spondylitis.

The objective of our study was to analyse the spatial pattern of mortality in relation to the most common causes of cancer in the Spanish autonomous community of Andalusia and its possible association with social inequalities.  Materials and methods:   A small area cross-sectional study in Andalusia, with census tracts as units of spatial analysis, for the period 2002-2013. Cases and person-years, sex and age group came from the Longitudinal Population Database of Andalusia. Standardized mortality rates and smoothed risk ratios were calculated using the Besag, York and Mollié model for lung, colorectal, breast, prostate, bladder and stomach cancer. In order to evaluate the association with social inequalities we included the deprivation index of the census tract as a covariate.  Results:   The results show an East-West mortality pattern with higher risk in the west for lung and bladder cancer among men, and breast cancer among women. For all of Andalusia, the association between deprivation index of the census tract and mortality relative risks is positive and significant for lung, stomach and bladder cancers in men, while in women we observed a negative association for lung cancer and a positive for stomach cancer.

Alternative splicing of its 20 exons generates various CD44 isoforms that have different tissue specific expression and functions, including the CD44 standard isoform (CD44s) encoded by the constant exons and the CD44 variant isoforms (CD44v) with variant exon insertions. Switching between the CD44v and CD44s isoforms plays pivotal roles in tumor progression. Here we reported a novel mechanism of CD44 alternative splicing induced by TGF-β1 and its connection to enhanced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness in human prostate cancer cells. TGF-β1 treatment increased the expression of CD44s and N-cadherin while decreased the expression of CD44v and E-cadherin in DU-145 prostate cancer cells. Other EMT markers and cancer stem cell markers were also upregulated after TGF-β1 treatment. RNAi knockdown of CD44 reversed the phenotype, which could be rescued by overexpressing CD44s but not CD44v, indicating the alternatively spliced isoform CD44s mediated the activity of TGF-β1 treatment. Mechanistically, TGF-β1 treatment induced the phosphorylation, poly-ubiquitination, and degradation of PCBP1, a well-characterized RNA binding protein known to regulate CD44 splicing. RNAi knockdown of PCBP1 was able to mimic TGF-β1 treatment to increase the expression of CD44s, as well as the EMT and cancer stem cell markers. In vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to show that CD44s promoted prostate cancer cell migration, invasion, and tumor initiation. Taken together, we defined a mechanism by which TGF-β1 induces CD44 alternative splicing and promotes prostate cancer progression.""","""['Qi Chen#', 'Meng Gu#', 'Zhi-Kang Cai#', 'Hu Zhao', 'Shi-Cheng Sun', 'Chong Liu', 'Ming Zhan', 'Yan-Bo Chen', 'Zhong Wang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cell Mol Life Sci""","""['Snail Driving Alternative Splicing of CD44 by ESRP1 Enhances Invasion and Migration in Epithelial Ovarian Cancer.', 'Direct Regulation of Alternative Splicing by SMAD3 through PCBP1 Is Essential to the Tumor-Promoting Role of TGF-β.', 'Mesenchymal splice isoform of CD44 (CD44s) promotes EMT/invasion and imparts stem-like properties to ovarian cancer cells.', 'Regulation of alternative splicing of CD44 in cancer.', 'CD44: A Multifunctional Mediator of Cancer Progression.', 'Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition-Related Markers in Prostate Cancer: From Bench to Bedside.', 'Crosstalk between Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Cancer Stem Cells Reveals a Novel Stemness-Related Signature to Predict Prognosis and Immunotherapy Responses for Bladder Cancer Patients.', 'Pleiotropic effects of DCLK1 in cancer and cancer stem cells.', 'The Role of Perineural Invasion in Prostate Cancer and Its Prognostic Significance.', 'The RNA-binding protein PCBP1 represses lung adenocarcinoma progression by stabilizing DKK1 mRNA and subsequently downregulating β-catenin.']"""

AUS implantation can be performed through a penoscrotal or perineal incision depending on surgeon preference.  Methods:   The present study compares initial AUS implantation through two surgical approaches focusing on outcomes of continence and revision. All AUS implanted at an academic medical center between 2000 and 2018 were retrospectively reviewed.  Results:   A total of 225 AUS implantations were identified, of which, 114 patients who underwent virgin AUS placement were included in the study with a mean follow-up of 28.5 months.

While operative time was significantly shorter for penoscrotal placement (98.6 min vs. 136.3 min, p = 0.001), there were no significant differences in continence rates between either surgical approach with 76.5% socially continent defined as using zero to less than 1 pad per day (safety pad). The overall rate of device erosion or infection was not significantly different between groups. However, the rate of revision or replacement was significantly higher in the perineal group (26.1% v. 8.8%; p = 0.01). On multivariate analysis, the penoscrotal incision predicted a lower rate of device revision (p = 0.01).

However, the roles of eIF3f in the development and progression of prostate cancer (PCa) have not been reported.  Materials and methods:   We performed in silico analysis to screen the expression of eIF3 subunits. Relevant shRNAs were used to knock down eIF3 subunits in 22Rv1 cells and cell proliferation was analyzed. eIF3f expression in PCa specimens ﻿was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. eIF3f knockdown was established to evaluate the effects of eIF3f on cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. RNA-seq, bioinformatics analysis and Western blotting were applied to explore the molecular details underlying the biological function of eIF3f in PCa cells. shRNA-resistant eIF3f and myristoylated-Akt were used to rescue the effects of eIF3f disturbance on PCa cells.  Results:   Functional analyses confirmed that eIF3f is essential for PCa proliferation. Notably, the expression of eIF3f was found to be elevated in human PCa tissues as well as in PCa cell lines. eIF3f silencing significantly suppressed the growth of PCa cells, both in vitro and in vivo. eIF3f expression was positively correlated with Akt signaling activity in RNA-﻿seq profiles and published prostate cohorts. Knockdown of eIF3f markedly reduced the levels of phosphorylated Akt in PCa cells. Exogenous expression of shRNA-resistant eIF3f in eIF3f knockdown cells restored Akt phosphorylation levels and cell growth. Importantly, rescue experiments revealed that ectopic expression of myristoylated-Akt partially alleviated the suppressive effects of eIF3f disturbance with respect to the growth of PCa cells.

Targeting signaling and tumor cell-immune cell interactions in the tumor microenvironment has led to the development of powerful immunotherapeutic agents, however, the prostate tumor milieu remains impermeable to these strategies highlighting the need for novel therapeutic targets. In this study, we provide compelling evidence to support the role of the RON receptor tyrosine kinase as a major regulator of macrophages in the prostate tumor microenvironment. We show that loss of RON selectively in prostate epithelial cells leads to significantly reduced prostate tumor growth and metastasis and is associated with increased intratumor infiltration of macrophages. We further demonstrate that prostate epithelial RON loss induces transcriptional reprogramming of macrophages to support expression of classical M1 markers and suppress expression of alternative M2 markers. Interestingly, our results show epithelial RON activation drives upregulation of RON expression in macrophages as a positive feed-forward mechanism to support prostate tumor growth. Using 3D coculture assays, we provide additional evidence that epithelial RON expression coordinates interactions between prostate tumor cells and macrophages to promote macrophage-mediated tumor cell growth. Taken together, our results suggest that RON receptor signaling in prostate tumor cells directs the functions of macrophages in the prostate tumor microenvironment to promote prostate cancer. IMPLICATIONS: Epithelial RON is a novel immunotherapeutic target that is responsible for directing the macrophage antitumor immune response to support prostate tumor growth and progression.""","""['Camille Sullivan', 'Nicholas E Brown', 'Juozas Vasiliauskas', 'Peterson Pathrose', 'Sandra L Starnes', 'Susan E Waltz']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['The ron receptor tyrosine kinase: a key regulator of inflammation and cancer progression.', 'Tumor Cell Autonomous RON Receptor Expression Promotes Prostate Cancer Growth Under Conditions of Androgen Deprivation.', 'Regulation of macrophage arginase expression and tumor growth by the Ron receptor tyrosine kinase.', 'The Ron receptor promotes prostate tumor growth in the TRAMP mouse model.', 'Oncogenic and invasive potentials of human macrophage-stimulating protein receptor, the RON receptor tyrosine kinase.', 'IL-8 Produced Via Bidirectional Communication Between Prostate Cancer and M2 Macrophages as a Potential Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarker.', 'Epigenetic modulation and prostate cancer: Paving the way for NK cell anti-tumor immunity.', 'RON-augmented cholesterol biosynthesis in breast cancer metastatic progression and recurrence.', 'An Introduction and Overview of RON Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Signaling.', 'The tumor innate immune microenvironment in prostate cancer: an overview of soluble factors and cellular effectors.']"""

Neoantigen-based vaccines have demonstrated promising efficacy for several cancer types. To further investigate the antitumor potentials for other types of solid tumors, we designed a peptide-based neoantigen vaccine, iNeo-Vac-P01, and conducted a single-arm, open-labeled, investigator-initiated clinical trial (NCT03662815).  Patients and methods:   Personalized neoantigen vaccines were designed and manufactured according to our bioinformatics analysis results from the whole-exome sequencing of tumor and peripheral blood cell DNAs. Patients were scheduled to be vaccinated subcutaneously with adjuvant on days 1, 4, 8, 15, and 22 (prime phase), and days 78 and 162 (boost phase). Additional immunizations were administrated every 2-3 months as per patient's potential benefit. The safety and efficacy were assessed through adverse events (AE), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and other parameters.  Results:   Of the 22 patients enrolled with advanced malignancies, 20 had no or mild AEs, while 2 had grade 3 or 4 acute allergic reactions only after their sixth boost vaccination. The disease control rate was 71.4%. The median PFS was 4.6 months, whereas the median OS was not reached (12-month OS = 55.1%). Around 80% of individual peptides or peptide pools elicited measurable specific immune response. In addition, our findings revealed several potential biomarkers for the prediction of better response.  Conclusions:   iNeo-Vac-P01 as monotherapy is feasible and safe for patients with advanced solid tumors. It could elicit T-cell-mediated immune response targeting tumor neoantigens, and might have promising antitumor efficacy.See related commentary by Filderman and Storkus, p. 4429.""","""['Yong Fang#', 'Fan Mo#', 'Jiawei Shou#', 'Huimin Wang', 'Kai Luo', 'Shanshan Zhang', 'Ning Han', 'Hongsen Li', 'Shengli Ye', 'Zhan Zhou', 'Rongchang Chen', 'Lin Chen', 'Liang Liu', 'Huina Wang', 'Hongming Pan', 'Shuqing Chen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Neoepitopes as Difference Makers for General Cancer Vaccines?', 'Neoepitopes as Difference Makers for General Cancer Vaccines?', 'A Neoantigen-Based Peptide Vaccine for Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer Refractory to Standard Treatment.', 'Combination treatment of radiofrequency ablation and peptide neoantigen vaccination: Promising modality for future cancer immunotherapy.', 'Personalized neoantigen vaccine prevents postoperative recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma patients with vascular invasion.', 'Engineering neoantigen vaccines to improve cancer personalized immunotherapy.', 'Preclinical and clinical development of neoantigen vaccines.', 'Adoptive neoantigen-reactive T cell therapy: improvement strategies and current clinical researches.', 'Designing neoantigen cancer vaccines, trials, and outcomes.', 'Mutant and non-mutant neoantigen-based cancer vaccines: recent advances and future promises.', 'Mannosylated Polycations Target CD206+ Antigen-Presenting Cells and Mediate T-Cell-Specific Activation in Cancer Vaccination.', 'Benefits of an Immunogenic Personalized Neoantigen Nanovaccine in Patients with High-Risk Gastric/Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer.']"""

Calcium mobilization assays were used to evaluate the 158 TCM compound components in HEK293 cells stably expressing TRPM8. An identified putative TRPM8 antagonist, sesamin, was further evaluated. Publicly available cancer OMICS data were used to explore the expression of TRPM8, its gene regulatory network, and the survival of patients with prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD). The cytotoxicity and specificity of sesamin to TRPM8 were tested in HEK293/TRPM8 cells. The effect of sesamin on cell proliferation in PRAD cell lines was assessed. Sesamin selectively inhibited TRPM8 in HEK293/TRPM8 cells (IC50: 9.78 μM), and a molecular docking study confirmed the binding of sesamin to TRPM8. TRPM8 was highly overexpressed in PRAD, and high TRPM8 expression was associated with poor survival of PRAD patients. Functional network analysis suggested that TRPM8 has key effects on proliferation, survival, and invasion of prostate cancer cells. Cell proliferation assays supported these findings and showed that sesamin inhibited the proliferation of PRAD cell lines DU145 and LNCaP cells. These data revealed that abnormal TRPM8 expression is associated with PRAD and that sesamin is a new anti-PRAD candidate drug, exerting inhibitory effects on TRPM8.""","""['Yutong Sui', 'Shiyou Li', 'Yahui Zhao', 'Qing Liu', 'Yanjiang Qiao', 'Li Feng', 'Sheng Li']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Fitoterapia""","""['Tetrahydroisoquinoline-Derived Urea and 2,5-Diketopiperazine Derivatives as Selective Antagonists of the Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 8 (TRPM8) Channel Receptor and Antiprostate Cancer Agents.', 'Menthol inhibits the proliferation and motility of prostate cancer DU145 cells.', 'Therapeutic potential of TRPM8 antagonists in prostate cancer.', 'TRPM8 biology and medicinal chemistry.', 'TRPM8: a potential target for cancer treatment.', 'Therapeutic potential of TRPM8 channels in cancer treatment.', 'AMTB, a TRPM8 antagonist, suppresses growth and metastasis of osteosarcoma through repressing the TGFβ signaling pathway.', 'TRPM8 Channels: Advances in Structural Studies and Pharmacological Modulation.', 'Binding of Androgen- and Estrogen-Like Flavonoids to Their Cognate (Non)Nuclear Receptors: A Comparison by Computational Prediction.']"""

Patients and methods:   We prospectively screened 1327 patients with a positive mpMRI undergoing TPFBx (targeted cores and systematic cores) under local anaesthesia, at two tertiary referral institutions, between September 2016 and May 2019, for inclusion in the present study. Primary outcomes were detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) defined as (1) International Society of Urological Pathologists (ISUP) grade >1 or ISUP grade 1 with >50% involvement of prostate cancer (PCa) in a single core or in >2 cores (D1) and (2) ISUP grade >1 PCa (D2). Secondary outcomes were: assessment of peri-procedural pain (numerical rating scale [NRS]) and procedure timings; erectile (International Index of Erectile Function) and urinary (International Prostate Symptom Score) function changes; and complications. We also investigated the value of systematic sampling and concordance with radical prostatectomy (RP).  Results:   A total of 1014 patients were included, of whom csPCa was diagnosed in 39.4% (n = 400). The procedure was tolerable (NRS pain score 3.1 ± 2.3), with no impact on erectile (P = 0.45) or urinary (P = 0.58) function, and a low rate of complications (Clavien-Dindo grades 1 or 2, n = 8; grade >2, n = 0). No post-biopsy sepsis was recorded. Twenty-two men (95% confidence interval [CI] 17-29) needed to undergo additional systematic biopsy to diagnose one csPCa missed by targeted biopsies (D1). ISUP grade concordance of biopsies with RP was as follows: k = 0.40 (95% CI 0.31-0.49) for targeted cores alone and k = 0.65 (95% CI 0.57-0.72; P < 0.05) overall.

Identifying microRNAs (miRNAs) in subjects' blood with various malignancies means that they can serve as novel biomarkers for prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis. This study analyzed serum-circulating miRNAs as a noninvasive biomarker in subjects with PCa and subjects with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). In total, 31 PCa subjects and 31 BPH subjects were included, with the BPH group serving as the control group. RT-qPCR was used to quantify the levels of 10 miRNAs, which included miR-18a, miR-34a, miR-106b, miR-183, miR-200a, miR-301a, miR-141, miR-182, miR-200b, and miR-375 in serum. Statistical tests were used to assess the relationship between the levels of miRNAs and the clinicopathological data. A significant increase was observed in the relative expression ratios of miR-141, miR-182, miR-200b, and miR-375 (1.89-, 2.09-, 2.41-, and 2.27-folds, respectively) in the PCa group when compared to the BPH group. Based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the largest area under the curve (AUC), 0.923, was associated with the miR-200b group, indicating effective diagnostic properties for this biomarker. A correlation was observed between total prostate-specific antigen (TPSA) and the relative levels of miR-141, miR-182, miR-200b, and miR-375. The Gleason score and the miR-200b expression level were also correlated. These results are consistent with previous studies regarding the possibility of differentiating between PCa subjects and healthy controls based on the detection of miRNA.

Kaplan-Meier curve analyses were utilized to determine overall survival with significance set at p<0.05.  Results:   Of the 25,734 patients, 11,376 (44.2%) received radiation treatment for their first cancer. Overall survival of bladder cancer was found to be 80%, 69.5%, and 49.2% at 1,2 and 5 years, respectively. There was no significant survival difference between groups whose first cancer was treated with or without radiation (p=0.8). A survival advantage was seen for the bladder cancer patients not treated with radiation for cervical (p=0.004), uterine (p=0.0006), and vaginal cancers (p<0.0001).

Methods and materials:   A total of 20 patients were treated with volumetric modulated arc-based SABR. Treatment verification consisted of pre- and post-radiation therapy cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) with gold marker-based TI every 3 seconds. In case of ≥3 mm (deviation limit) displacement, the treatment was interrupted and imaging-based correction was performed. Beam interruptions, intrafractional shifts, and treatment times were recorded. Prostate, rectum, and bladder were delineated on each CBCT. Target coverage was evaluated by comparing the individual prostate delineations with 98% isodose contour volumes (% of the evaluated volumes exceeding the reference). Both inter- and intrafractional changes of bladder and rectal volumes were assessed.  Results:   The average overall treatment time (±standard deviation) was 18 ± 11 min, with a radiation delivery time of 6 ± 3 min if no intrafractional CBCT acquisitions were necessary (91% of fractions). On average, 1.2 beam interruptions per fraction were required with 0/1 correction in 71% of the fractions. The mean residual 3-dimensional shift was 1.6 mm, exceeding the deviation limit in 8%. In the case of intrafractional CBCT and/or ≥2 corrections the treatment time dramatically increased. The 98% isodose lines did not encompass the prostate in only 8/180 (4%) evaluations in 6 different patients, leading to a loss of D98 between 0.1%-6% as a worst case scenario. The bladder volumes showed significant increases during treatment (P < .01) while rectal volumes were stable.  Conclusions:   Time efficiency of TI + auto beam hold with 3 mm/3 sec threshold during prostate SABR is comparable with competitive techniques, resulting in minimal 3-dimensional residual errors with maintained target coverage.

Predominant motion was inferior and posterior, and probability of motion increased with time. Natural motion >3 mm and >5 mm in any direction was observed in 32.3% and 10.2% of fractions, respectively. Calypso monitoring (n = 50) demonstrated similar motion results. In the 151 MV-kV patients with ≥3-month follow-up (median, 9.5 months; range, 3-26.5 months), grade ≥2 acute genitourinary/gastrointestinal and late genitourinary/gastrointestinal toxicity was observed in 9.9%/2.0% and 11.9%/2.7%, respectively. Biochemical control was 99.3% with a single failure in a high-risk patient.  Conclusions:   The MV-kV system is an effective method to manage intrafraction prostate motion during SBRT, offering the opportunity to correct for prostate clinical target volume displacements that would have otherwise extended beyond typical planning target volume margins.""","""['Daniel Gorovets', 'Sarah Burleson', 'Lauren Jacobs', 'Bosky Ravindranath', 'Kevin Tierney', 'Marisa Kollmeier', 'Sean McBride', 'Laura Happersett', 'Margie Hunt', 'Michael Zelefsky']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Retrospective analysis of MV-kV imaging-based fiducial tracking in prostate SBRT treatment.', 'Intrafraction 4D-cone beam CT acquired during volumetric arc radiotherapy delivery: kV parameter optimization and 4D motion accuracy for lung stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) patients.', 'Three-dimensional, time-resolved, intrafraction motion monitoring throughout stereotactic liver radiation therapy on a conventional linear accelerator.', 'Triggered kV Imaging During Spine SBRT for Intrafraction Motion Management.', 'The magnetic resonance imaging-linac system.', 'Dosimetric Impact of Intrafraction Prostate Motion and Interfraction Anatomical Changes in Dose-Escalated Linac-Based SBRT.', 'Markerless motion tracking with simultaneous MV and kV imaging in spine SBRT treatment-a feasibility study.', 'Intrafraction Prostate Motion Management During Dose-Escalated Linac-Based Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy.', 'Retrospective analysis of MV-kV imaging-based fiducial tracking in prostate SBRT treatment.', 'Adaptive radiation therapy strategies in the treatment of prostate cancer patients using hypofractionated VMAT.']"""

Conventional chemotherapeutic drugs available for PCa treatment are limited due to toxicity and resistance issues. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop more effective treatment for advanced PCa. In this current study, we focused on evaluating the anti-cancer efficacy of Eprinomectin (EP), a novel avermectin analog against PC3 metastatic PCa cells. EP displayed robust inhibition of cell viability of PC3 cells in addition to suppressing the colony formation and wound healing capabilities. Our study showed that EP targets PC3 cells via inducing ROS and apoptosis activation. EP treatment enforces cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase via targeting cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and subsequent induction of apoptosis in PC3 cells. At the molecular level, EP effectively inhibited the expression of various cancer stem cell markers such as ALDH1, Sox-2, Nanog, Oct3/4 and CD44. Interestingly, EP also inhibited the activity of alkaline phosphatase, a maker of pluripotent stem cells. Of note, EP treatment resulted in the translocation of β-catenin from the nucleus to the cytoplasm indicating that EP antagonizes Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Western blotting analysis revealed that EP downregulated the expression of key cell cycle markers such as cyclin D1, cyclin D3, CDK4, and c-Myc. In addition, EP inhibited the anti-apoptotic markers such as Mcl-1, XIAP, c-IAP1 and survivin in PC3 cells. On the other hand, EP treatment resulted in the activation of pH2A.X, Bad, caspase-9, caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP1. Taken together, our data suggests that EP is a potential agent to treat advanced PCa cells via modulating apoptosis signaling.""","""['Angela Lincy Prem Antony Samy', 'Velavan Bakthavachalam', 'Mona Vudutha', 'Smita Vinjamuri', 'Somaiah Chinnapaka', 'Gnanasekar Munirathinam']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Toxicol Appl Pharmacol""","""['Eprinomectin: a derivative of ivermectin suppresses growth and metastatic phenotypes of prostate cancer cells by targeting the β-catenin signaling pathway.', 'Nitro aspirin (NCX4040) induces apoptosis in PC3 metastatic prostate cancer cells via hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-mediated oxidative stress.', '3,6-diazabicyclo3.3.1heptanes Induces Apoptosis and Arrests Cell Cycle in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Cytotoxic effects of a triterpene-enriched fraction of Cecropia pachystachya on the human hormone-refractory prostate cancer PC3 cell line.', 'Therapeutic Potential of Marine Peptides in Prostate Cancer: Mechanistic Insights.', 'Eprinomectin: a derivative of ivermectin suppresses growth and metastatic phenotypes of prostate cancer cells by targeting the β-catenin signaling pathway.', 'ALDH1: A potential therapeutic target for cancer stem cells in solid tumors.', 'Polygodial, a Sesquiterpene Dialdehyde, Activates Apoptotic Signaling in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cell Lines by Inducing Oxidative Stress.', 'Anthelmintics for drug repurposing: Opportunities and challenges.']"""

To date, there is limited published data on this biologically distinct and clinically relevant subgroup's natural history and response to treatment.  Methods:   We retrospectively identified patients at two academic institutions who had MMRd/MSI-high metastatic prostate cancer (PC). Clinical and pathologic characteristics at the time of diagnosis as well as response to standard therapies and immune checkpoint therapy were abstracted. Descriptive statistics, including PSA50 response (≥50% decline in PSA from baseline) and clinical/radiographic progression free survival (PFS), are reported.  Results:   27 men with MMRd and/or MSI-high metastatic PC were identified. 13 (48%) men had M1 disease at diagnosis and 19 of 24 (79%) men that underwent prostate biopsy had a Gleason score ≥8. Median overall survival from time of metastasis was not reached (95% CI: 33.6-NR mos) after a median follow up of 33.6 mos (95% CI: 23.8-50.5 mos). Seventeen men received pembrolizumab, of which 15 had PSA response data available. PSA50 responses to pembrolizumab occurred in 8 (53%) men. Median PFS was not reached (95% CI: 1.87-NR mos) and the estimated PFS at 6 months was 64.1% (95% CI: 33.7%-83.4%). Of those who achieved a PSA50 response, 7 (87.5%) remain on treatment without evidence of progression at a median follow up of 12 months (range 3-20 months).  Conclusions:   MMRd PC is associated with high Gleason score and advanced disease at presentation. Response rates to standard therapies are comparable to those reported in unselected patients and response rate to checkpoint blockade is high.

Materials and Methods: In the current study, the behavior of 3,4-divanillyltetrahydrofuran (DTH) was examined against prostate cancer cells, which have androgen sensitivity differences [LNCaP (+), PC3 (-)]. For this aim, DTH was obtained by extraction of Urtica dioica roots. The molecular structure of isolated compound was confirmed as DTH by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy analyses. To evaluate the association of androgen sensitivity, DTH was radiolabeled with 131I, and cell uptake assay was performed by using 131I-radiolabeled DTH. Also, cytotoxicity (WST-1) assay of DTH was performed against LNCaP and PC3 cells to determinate the toxic effects of DTH on different androgen mechanisms. Results: The results of assays on cells have shown that DTH lignan behaves different like being more toxic to LNCaP cells than PC3 cells, depending on androgen sensitivity.

Despite this, there are still a large number of patients with prostate cancer who have a biochemical recurrence after undergoing radiotherapy, or even clinical recurrence, leading to treatment failure. Although the expression of the fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1) gene has been found to be absent in various tumors and is associated with a poor prognosis in tumor patients. However, the expression and role of FBP1 in prostate cancer are not clear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role and mechanism of FBP1 in the radiotherapy resistance of prostate cancer. By analyzing the microarray data of prostate cancer radiotherapy resistant cells and parental cells (GSE53902), we found that FBP1 expression in DU145 radiotherapy resistant cells was significantly higher than in the DU145 parental cells. In addition, we searched for the expression of FBP1 in 492 prostate cancer samples from TCGA and found that its expression in prostate cancer was significantly higher than that in normal tissues. Knockdown of FBP1 expression significantly inhibited the proliferation of prostate cancer cells, promoted DNA damage-mediated apoptosis, and enhanced the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to radiotherapy. Further mechanism analysis revealed that FBP1 knockdown could activate autophagy mediated by the AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway, while inhibition of the AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway could reverse FBP1 knockdown-mediated autophagy and apoptosis, as well as radiosensitization. In conclusion, this study clarified that FBP1 is an oncogene in prostate cancer, and the main mechanism for knockdown of FBP1 to increase radiosensitivity is to enhance autophagy mediated by the AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway. Therefore, FBP1 may be a potential target for enhancing prostate cancer radiotherapy.""","""['X R Li', 'K Q Zhou', 'Z Yin', 'Y L Gao', 'X Yang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Neoplasma""","""['MiR-205 suppresses autophagy and enhances radiosensitivity of prostate cancer cells by targeting TP53INP1.', 'Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is associated with prostate cancer metastasis and chemo/radioresistance via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.', 'Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase is a novel regulator of Wnt/β-Catenin pathway in breast cancer.', 'Targeting MicroRNAs in Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy.', 'Targeting autophagy in prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic response.', 'FBP1 is a potential prognostic biomarker and correlated with tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment in glioblastoma.', 'Immune-related gene index predicts metastasis for prostate cancer patients undergoing radical radiotherapy.', 'Revisited Metabolic Control and Reprogramming Cancers by Means of the Warburg Effect in Tumor Cells.', ""AMPK's double-faced role in advanced stages of prostate cancer."", 'Expression status and prognostic value of autophagy-related lncRNAs in prostate cancer.']"""

All patient and tumor characteristics and outcome data were collected.  Results:   A total of 164 patients (37.7%) had metastatic DAC, including 112 with de novo metastases and 52 who developed metastases after treatment. Men with de novo metastases were found to have a significantly higher median prostate-specific antigen level and International Society of Urological Pathology grade but a lower cT3 and/or T4 classification compared with those with metastases that developed after treatment (all P < .05). Approximately 87% of men with de novo metastases progressed despite multiple systemic therapies, 37.6% required intervention for the palliation of symptoms, and 10.1% responded to systemic therapy and underwent treatment of the primary tumor. Men with de novo metastatic DAC and those who developed metastases after treatment had multiple metastatic sites (including bone and viscera), with higher rates of lung metastases noted in the posttreatment group (23.2% vs 44.2%; P = .01). A total of 45 patients who were treated with curative intent developed metastases at a median of 22 months (range, 0.9-74.8 months) after treatment, at low prostate-specific antigen levels (median, 4.4 ng/mL [interquartile range, 1.7-11.1 ng/mL]).

In addition, the limitations of these criteria and levels of personal confidence reported by the readers when reporting the findings were determined. The effects of interpersonal differences on clinical decisions were also investigated.  Methods:   PSMA PET images from 133 cases were reported independently by four different readers at different times according to the molecular imaging TNM (miTNM) and PSMA-reporting and data system (RADS) templates.  Results:   There was substantial interobserver agreement for overall positivity, miT, miN and miM staging (Fleiss' κ = 0.65, 0.625, 0.731, and 0.779). Substantial agreement levels were observed in reporting of seminal vesicle invasion, the number of lymph node stations with metastasis, total number of intraprostatic areas containing tumors, and lymph node metastasis staging (Fleiss' κ = 0.622 and 0.779). The highest variation was seen in the reporting of intraprostatic distribution: In International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade group 1, moderate agreement was observed, and it was seen that the agreement level for the T staging increased with an increasing ISUP group in the staging group (Fleiss' κ = 0.531 vs. 0.655).

Disagreement according to miTNM staging had a major effect on clinical management in only 9% (n = 12) of the patients.  Conclusion:   PSMA PET has a lower interobserver variability and higher reproducibility than other imaging methods used for imaging of prostate cancer do, including CT, MRI, and bone scintigraphy. The miTNM template provides a reporting format that is highly reproducible and has a high level of agreement among readers, but the prostatic template needs development.

Few studies have been published on how communication between Black prostate cancer survivors and their family members affect health outcomes and subsequent health communication. The purpose of this study was to understand cancer and health communication among Black prostate cancer survivors and their families before and after disclosing their diagnosis. Through a mixed method design, 11 Black prostate cancer survivors participated from the Southeastern region of the United States, completed questionnaires, and took part in a focus group. The study utilized 4 focus groups of Black prostate cancer survivors ranging in age from 51 to 76 years. Descriptive statistics revealed 91% (n = 10) of participants indicated they could openly discuss health issues in their family and 82% (n = 9) indicated a female relative as the person responsible for teaching about health. An analysis of the transcripts revealed four themes utilizing thematic network: (a) communication over the life course of the prostate cancer survivor, (b) parents' communication with family, (c) disclosing prostate cancer diagnosis, and (d) treatment options for prostate cancer. Results suggested the participants recognized the importance of discussing prostate cancer with their families to reduce fears and misconceptions about the disease.

This study proposes an inverse finite-element (FE) based computational framework, for characterizing the size of examined tissue sample and detecting the presence of embedded tumor nodules using instrumented palpation, without a priori anatomical knowledge. The inverse analysis was applied to a model system, the human prostate, and was based on the reaction forces which can be obtained by trans-rectal mechanical probing and those from an equivalent FE model, which was optimized iteratively, by minimizing an error function between the two cases, toward the target solution. The tumor nodule can be identified through its influence on the stress state of the prostate. The effectiveness of the proposed method was further verified using a realistic prostate model reconstructed from magnetic resonance (MR) images. The results show the proposed framework to be capable of characterizing the key geometrical indices of the prostate and identifying the presence of cancerous nodules. Therefore, it has potential, when combined with instrumented palpation, for primary diagnosis of prostate cancer, and, potentially, solid tumors in other types of soft tissue.""","""['Antonio Candito', 'Javier Palacio-Torralba', 'Elizabeth Jiménez-Aguilar', 'Daniel W Good', 'Alan McNeill', 'Robert L Reuben', 'Yuhang Chen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Numer Method Biomed Eng""","""['A novel palpation-based method for tumor nodule quantification in soft tissue-computational framework and experimental validation.', 'Quantitative diagnostics of soft tissue through viscoelastic characterization using time-based instrumented palpation.', 'A novel method for rapid and quantitative mechanical assessment of soft tissue for diagnostic purposes: A computational study.', 'Locating and sizing tumor nodules in human prostate using instrumented probing - computational framework and experimental validation.', 'Conditioned haptic perception for 3D localization of nodules in soft tissue palpation with a variable stiffness probe.', 'Patient-Specific Inverse Modeling of In Vivo Cardiovascular Mechanics with Medical Image-Derived Kinematics as Input Data: Concepts, Methods, and Applications.']"""

Methods:   A total of 180 consecutive patients who underwent RARP at our institution were investigated. Rhabdomyolysis was defined as creatine kinase (CK) > 1050 IU/L after RARP. The association between CK and renal function after RARP was investigated, and the factors related to rhabdomyolysis after RARP were also investigated.  Results:   Postoperative CK (407 ± 936 IU/L) was significantly higher than preoperative CK (134 ± 75 IU/L) (p < 0.001), and eGFR after RARP was significantly negatively correlated with CK on the day after RARP (correlation coefficient (ρ) = - 0.248, p = 0.007), but the significant negative correlation disappeared on the 7th day after RARP (ρ = - 0.010, p = 0.32). On multivariate analysis, postoperative CK elevation was significantly correlated with console time (p = 0.002). Rhabdomyolysis was observed in 6.1% (11/180), and of the patients with rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure was transiently observed in 45.5% (5/11). On multivariate analysis, rhabdomyolysis was significantly associated with higher body mass index (BMI) (> 25.7 kg/m2) and longer console time (> 188 min) (p = 0.02 and p = 0.005, respectively).  Conclusion:   Temporary renal dysfunction can occur after RARP due to CK elevation. Thus, sufficient attention must be paid to renal insufficiency after elevation of CK values for several days after RARP.

However, these have not been validated externally, and their clinical benefit compared with alternative approaches remains unclear.  Objective:   To assess previously published PCa RCs incorporating MRI data, and compare their performance with traditional RCs (European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer [ERSPC] 3/4 and Prostate Biopsy Collaborative Group [PBCG]) and the blood-based Stockholm3 test.  Design, setting, and participants:   RCs were tested in a prospective multicenter cohort including 532 men aged 45-74 yr participating in the Stockholm3-MRI study between 2016 and 2017.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The probabilities of detection of clinically significant PCa (csPCa) defined as Gleason score ≥3 + 4 were calculated for each patient. For each RC and the Stockholm3 test, discrimination was assessed by area under the curve (AUC), calibration by numerical and graphical summaries, and clinical usefulness by decision curve analysis (DCA).  Results and limitations:   The discriminative ability of MRI RCs 1-4 for the detection of csPCa was superior (AUC 0.81-0.87) to the traditional RCs (AUC 0.76-0.80). The observed prevalence of csPCa in the cohort was 37%, but calibration-in-the-large predictions varied from 14% to 63% across models. DCA identified only one model including MRI data as clinically useful at a threshold probability of 10%. The Stockholm3 test achieved equivalent performance for discrimination (AUC 0.86) and DCA, but was underpredicting the actual risk.  Conclusions:   Although MRI RCs discriminated csPCa better than traditional RCs, their predicted probabilities were variable in accuracy, and DCA identified only one model as clinically useful.  Patient summary:   Novel risk calculators (RCs) incorporating imaging improved the ability to discriminate clinically significant prostate cancer compared with traditional tools. However, all but one predicted divergent compared with actual risks, suggesting that regional modifications be implemented before usage.

Objective:   The aim of this study was to visually analyze typical patterns of lymph node (LN) involvement for prostate cancer (PC) patients with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy and lymphadenectomy by creating a color-coded heat map using gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography (68Ga-PSMA-PET) imaging. Further, we evaluated which LNs were covered by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) clinical target volume (CTV) contouring guidelines.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 1653 68Ga-PSMA-PET/computed tomography (CT) datasets were screened retrospectively. After meeting the eligibility criteria, 233 patients with 799 LN metastases were included in our study.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We created a comprehensive three-dimensional color-coded LN atlas. Further, the coverage of LN metastases by RTOG CTV was assessed and stratification for risk factors was performed.  Results and limitations:   In the overall, mainly high risk, collective, complete coverage by the standard RTOG CTV was accomplished in 31.0% of all LN metastases. The vast majority of uncovered LNs are situated in the para-aortal, pararectal, paravesical, preacetabular, presacral, and inguinal regions. Concerning examined stratification factors, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels at the time of PET/CT imaging had the highest predictive value for extrapelvic metastatic LN spread. Every increase of 1 ng/mL in PSA raises the risk of metastases outside the CTV by a factor of 1.43.  Conclusions:   We developed the first LN atlas for patients with recurrent PC using a heat map technique, in order to illustrate hot spots of LN recurrence. The vast majority of detected LNs are not covered by a standard CTV as recommended by the RTOG. Application of the standard RTOG CTV for pelvic irradiation in the salvage setting for high-risk PC patients seems to be inappropriate.

Objective:   To determine the prevalence, genomic context, and clinical associations of AKT1/PIK3CA activating mutations in mCRPC.  Design, setting, and participants:   We analysed targeted cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing data from 599 metastatic prostate cancer patients with circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) content above 2%.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   In patients with AKT1/PIK3CA mutations, cfDNA was subjected to PTEN intron sequencing and matched diagnostic tumour tissue was analysed when possible.  Results and limitations:   Of the patients, 6.0% (36/599) harboured somatic clonal activating mutation(s) in AKT1 or PIK3CA. Mutant allele-specific imbalance was common. Clonal mutations in mCRPC ctDNA were typically detected in pretreatment primary tissue and were consistent across serial ctDNA collections. AKT1/PIK3CA-mutant mCRPC had fewer androgen receptor (AR) gene copies than AKT1/PIK3CA wild-type mCRPC (median 4.7 vs 10.3, p = 0.003). AKT1 mutations were mutually exclusive with PTEN alterations. Patients with and without AKT1/PIK3CA mutations showed similar clinical outcomes with standard of care treatments. A heavily pretreated mCRPC patient with an AKT1 mutation experienced a 50% decline in prostate-specific antigen with Akt inhibitor (ipatasertib) monotherapy. Ipatasertib also had a marked antitumour effect in a patient-derived xenograft harbouring an AKT1 mutation. Limitations include the inability to assess AKT1/PIK3CA correlatives in ctDNA-negative patients.  Conclusions:   AKT1/PIK3CA activating mutations are relatively common and delineate a distinct mCRPC molecular subtype with low-level AR copy gain. Clonal prevalence and evidence of mutant allele selection propose PI3K pathway dependency in selected patients. The use of cfDNA screening enables prospective clinical trials to test PI3K pathway inhibitors in this population.  Patient summary:   Of advanced prostate cancer cases, 6% have activating mutations in the genes AKT1 or PIK3CA. These mutations can be identified using a blood test and may help select patients suitable for clinical trials of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors.""","""['Cameron Herberts', 'Andrew J Murtha', 'Simon Fu', 'Gang Wang', 'Elena Schönlau', 'Hui Xue', 'Dong Lin', 'Anna Gleave', 'Steven Yip', 'Arkhjamil Angeles', 'Sebastien Hotte', 'Ben Tran', 'Scott North', 'Sinja Taavitsainen', 'Kevin Beja', 'Gillian Vandekerkhove', 'Elie Ritch', 'Evan Warner', 'Fred Saad', 'Nayyer Iqbal', 'Matti Nykter', 'Martin E Gleave', 'Yuzhuo Wang', 'Matti Annala', 'Kim N Chi', 'Alexander W Wyatt']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['PIK Carefully, AKT Accordingly: Towards Precision Medicine in Prostate Cancer.', 'Plasma Cell-Free DNA Profiling of PTEN-PI3K-AKT Pathway Aberrations in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Circulating tumor DNA alterations in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Concordance of Circulating Tumor DNA and Matched Metastatic Tissue Biopsy in Prostate Cancer.', 'Predicting therapy response and resistance in metastatic prostate cancer with circulating tumor DNA.', 'Circulating Tumor DNA Testing for Homology Recombination Repair Genes in Prostate Cancer: From the Lab to the Clinic.', 'Joint analysis of WES and RNA-Seq identify signature genes related to metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'Familial CCM Genes Might Not Be Main Drivers for Pathogenesis of Sporadic CCMs-Genetic Similarity between Cancers and Vascular Malformations.', 'Molecular mechanism study and tumor heterogeneity of Chinese angelica and Fructus aurantii in the treatment of colorectal cancer through computational and molecular dynamics.', 'Identification and Validation of FGF-Related Prognostic Signatures in Prostate Cancer.', 'Identification of Promising Drug Candidates against Prostate Cancer through Computationally-Driven Drug Repurposing.']"""

Although initially effective, resistance to androgen targeted therapies develops followed by disease progression to castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Hypoxia and HIF1a have been implicated in the development of resistance to androgen targeted therapies and progression to CRCP. The interplay between the androgen and hypoxia/HIF1a signaling axes was investigated.  Methods:   In vitro stable expression of HIF1a was established in the LNCaP cell line by physiological induction or retroviral transduction. Tumor xenografts with stable expression of HIF1a were established in castrated and non-castrated mouse models. Gene expression analysis identified transcriptional changes in response to androgen treatment, hypoxia and HIF1a. The binding sites of the AR and HIF transcription factors were identified using ChIP-seq.  Results:   Androgen and HIF1a signaling promoted proliferation in vitro and enhanced tumor growth in vivo. The stable expression of HIF1a in vivo restored tumor growth in the absence of endogenous androgens. Hypoxia reduced AR binding sites whereas HIF binding sites were increased with androgen treatment under hypoxia. Gene expression analysis identified seven genes that were upregulated both by AR and HIF1a, of which six were prognostic.  Conclusions:   The oncogenic AR, hypoxia and HIF1a pathways support prostate cancer development through independent signaling pathways and transcriptomic profiles. AR and hypoxia/HIF1a signaling pathways independently promote prostate cancer progression and therapeutic targeting of both pathways simultaneously is warranted.""","""['Maxine G B Tran', 'Becky A S Bibby', 'Lingjian Yang', 'Franklin Lo', 'Anne Y Warren', 'Deepa Shukla', 'Michelle Osborne', 'James Hadfield', 'Thomas Carroll', 'Rory Stark', 'Helen Scott', 'Antonio Ramos-Montoya', 'Charlie Massie', 'Patrick Maxwell', 'Catharine M L West', 'Ian G Mills', 'David E Neal']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Dual targeting of the androgen receptor and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α pathways synergistically inhibits castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Orphan nuclear receptor TLX contributes to androgen insensitivity in castration-resistant prostate cancer via its repression of androgen receptor transcription.', 'Hypoxia enhances transcriptional activity of androgen receptor through hypoxia-inducible factor-1α in a low androgen environment.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'siRNA-mediated stathmin1 silencing inhibits proliferation of prostate carcinoma cell line.', 'A compendium of Androgen Receptor Variant 7 target genes and their role in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Hypoxia promotes conversion to a stem cell phenotype in prostate cancer cells by activating HIF-1α/Notch1 signaling pathway.', 'CHD1 deletion stabilizes HIF1α to promote angiogenesis and glycolysis in prostate cancer.', 'Age- and Stage-Dependent Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness Associated with Differential Notch Signaling.']"""

The mRNA expression of the genes involved in oxidative stress and Wnt signaling was analyzed in the prostate. Histopathology, ROS, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were also measured.  Results:   Loss of Gpx3 did not affect body weight and GUT weight in Nkx3.1 knockout mice. The mRNA expression of SOD3, iNOS, Hmox, and CISD2, which are associated with oxidative stress, was increased in Nkx3.1-/-; Gpx3-/- mice at 4 months but decreased at 8 and 12 months. There was no change in β-catenin and its targets associated with Wnt signaling. Increased ROS and decreased SOD activity were observed in Nkx3.1-/-; Gpx3-/- mice at 12 months of age. The histopathologic score and epithelium thickness were increased, and lumen area was decreased in Gpx3 knockout mice.  Discussion and conclusions:   Gpx3 loss increased the hyperplasia of PIN in the pre-cancerous stage of the prostate. Loss of Gpx3 induced oxidative stress. Histopathologically, no invasive carcinoma was identified, and Gpx3 loss did not increase Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Further research on the role of GPX3 in the transition of PIN to invasive carcinoma is needed. We show, for the first time, that the antioxidant enzyme GPX3 plays a vital role in inhibiting hyperplasia in the PIN stage of the prostate gland in vivo.""","""['Ukjin Kim', 'C-Yoon Kim', 'Ji Min Lee', 'Bokyeong Ryu', 'Jin Kim', 'Junpil Bang', 'Na Ahn', 'Jae-Hak Park']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Andrology""","""['MYC overexpression induces prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and loss of Nkx3.1 in mouse luminal epithelial cells.', 'Loss-of-function of Nkx3.1 promotes increased oxidative damage in prostate carcinogenesis.', 'Decreased NKX3.1 protein expression in focal prostatic atrophy, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and adenocarcinoma: association with gleason score and chromosome 8p deletion.', 'Mechanisms of prostate tumorigenesis: roles for transcription factors Nkx3.1 and Egr1.', 'Prospective origins of prostate carcinoma.

The only data available until now on the utility of a peritoneal flap to prevent lymphocele were retrospectively acquired.  Methods:   A randomized, controlled, multi-center trial with blinded assessment of endpoints was carried out on 232 patients with prostate cancer who underwent RARP with PLND. The patients in the intervention group were given a peritoneal flap; in the control group, surgery was performed without this modification. The two joint primary endpoints were the rates of symptomatic lymphocele during the same hospitalization as the operative procedure (iT1) and within 90 days of surgery (iT2). The secondary endpoints were lymphocele volume, the need for treatment of lymphocele, complications requiring an intervention, and the degree of postoperative stress incontinence. German Clinical Trials Register number: DRKS00011115.  Results:   The data were evaluated in an intention-to-treat analysis, which, in this trial, was identical to an as-treated analysis. 108 patients (46.6%) were allotted to the intervention group. There were no statistically significant intergroup differences with respect to any clinical or histopathological criteria. A median of 16 lymph nodes were removed (interquartile range, 11-21). A symptomatic lymphocele arose in 1.3% (iT1) and 9.1% (iT2) of the patients, without any statistically significant difference between the two trial groups (p = 0.599 and p = 0.820, respectively). Nor did the groups differ significantly with respect to lymphocele volume (p = 0.670 on hospital discharge [T1], p = 0.650 90 days after surgery [T2]) or the type and frequency of need for subsequent surgical intervention (p = 0.535; iT2). 81.5% of all patients (n = 189) had no complications at all in the first three months after surgery. Nor were there any intergroup differences at 90 days with respect to the degree of stress urinary incontinence (p = 0.306) or complications (p = 0.486).

It has previously been associated with the development of castration resistance. However, RGS2 expression in clinical specimens of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and its clinical relevance has not been explored. In the present study, RGS2 was assessed in CRPC and in relation to the development of castration resistance.  Methods:   In the present study, RGS2 expression was evaluated with immunohistochemistry in patient materials of hormone-naïve and castration-resistant primary tumors, also in matched specimens before and after 3 months of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to evaluate the clinical significance of RGS2 expression. RGS2 expression in association to castration-resistant growth was assessed experimentally in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model of CRPC. In vitro, hormone depletion of LNCaP and enzalutamide treatment of LNCaP, 22Rv1, and VCaP was performed to evaluate the association between RGS2 and the androgen receptor (AR). Stable RGS2 knockdown was used to evaluate the impact of RGS2 in association to PC cell growth under hormone-reduced conditions. Gene and protein expression were evaluated with quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis, respectively.  Results:   RGS2 expression is increased in CRPC and enriched under ADT. Furthermore, a high RGS2 level is prognostic for poor cancer-specific survival for CRPC patients and significantly reduced failure-free survival (FFS) after an initiated ADT. Additionally, the prognostic value of RGS2 outperforms prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in terms of FFS. The present study furthermore suggests that RGS2 expression is reflective of AR activity. Moreover, low RGS2-expressing cells display hampered growth under hormone-reduced conditions, in line with the poor prognosis associated with high RGS2 expression.  Conclusions:   High levels of RGS2 are associated with aggressive forms of castration-resistant PC. The results demonstrate that a high level of RGS2 is associated with poor prognosis in association with castration-resistant PC growth. RGS2 alone, or in association with PSA, has the potential to identify patients that require additional treatment at an early stage during ADT.""","""['Anna Linder', 'Karin Larsson', 'Karin Welén', 'Jan-Erik Damber']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['NDRG2 acts as a negative regulator downstream of androgen receptor and inhibits the growth of androgen-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Patient-derived Hormone-naive Prostate Cancer Xenograft Models Reveal Growth Factor Receptor Bound Protein 10 as an Androgen Receptor-repressed Gene Driving the Development of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Restoration of the cellular secretory milieu overrides androgen dependence of in\xa0vivo generated castration resistant prostate cancer cells overexpressing the androgen receptor.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Targeting the androgen receptor signaling pathway in advanced prostate cancer.', 'RGS proteins and their roles in cancer: friend or foe?', 'A Previously Unrecognized Molecular Landscape of Lynch Syndrome in the Mexican Population.', 'Integrated analysis of the functions and clinical implications of exosome circRNAs in colorectal cancer.']"""

However, most times chemotherapy with docetaxel eventually fails due to the development of docetaxel resistance. Natural killer (NK) cells are the first line of defense against cancer and infections. NK cell function is determined by a delicate balance between signals received via activating and inhibitory receptors. The aim of this study is to explore whether the potential docetaxel-resistant mechanism is associated with impaired NK cell cytotoxicity toward CRPC cells.  Methods:   By performing MTT assay, we explored the role of docetaxel in regulating NK cells' cytotoxicity. Western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis were used to measure messenger RNA and protein levels separately. Luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay were performed to analyze the mechanism.  Results:   We found that docetaxel could suppress the immunotherapy efficacy of NK cells toward CRPC cells via the androgen receptor (AR)-lectin-like transcript 1 (LLT1) signals in vitro. Analysis of the mechanism revealed that docetaxel functioned through increasing AR to upregulate LLT1 expression in CRPC cells. AR transcriptionally activated LLT1 expression by binding to its promoter region. Furthermore, targeting AR with ASC-J9 or blocking LL1 by anti-human LLT1 monoclonal antibody could reverse the suppressive effect of docetaxel on the immunotherapy efficacy of NK cells toward CRPC cells.  Conclusions:   We concluded that chemotherapy agent docetaxel could increase AR that transcriptionally regulated the expression of NK inhibitory ligand LLT1 on CRPC cells. An increase of LL1 may further suppress the immunological efficacy of NK cells to kill CRPC cells. Additionally, targeting AR or blocking LL1 could enhance the immunotherapy efficacy of NK cells toward CRPC cells which might be considered as a new therapeutic option for the prevention or treatment of docetaxel resistance.""","""['Min Tang', 'Shenglin Gao', 'Lei Zhang', 'Bianjiang Liu', 'Jie Li', 'Zengjun Wang', 'Wei Zhang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Cisplatin enhances NK cells immunotherapy efficacy to suppress HCC progression via altering the androgen receptor (AR)-ULBP2 signals.', 'Targeting the androgen receptor (AR) with AR degradation enhancer ASC-J9® led to increase docetaxel sensitivity via suppressing the p21 expression.', 'Overexpression of LLT1 (OCIL, CLEC2D) on prostate cancer cells inhibits NK cell-mediated killing through LLT1-NKRP1A (CD161) interaction.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Interference with the androgen receptor protein stability in therapy-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Natural killer cell-related gene signature predicts malignancy of glioma and the survival of patients.', 'Identification of a Prognosis-Related Risk Signature for Bladder Cancer to Predict Survival and Immune Landscapes.', 'The Role of Androgen Receptor in Cross Talk Between Stromal Cells and Prostate Cancer Epithelial Cells.', 'The immune microenvironment and relation to outcome in patients with advanced breast cancer treated with docetaxel with or without gemcitabine.']"""

The purpose of this study was to identify and provide practical advice for men managing their BRCA-related cancer risks based on men's real-life experiences. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 25 men who either tested positive for a pathogenic variant in BRCA1/2 gene or who had an immediate family member who had tested positive for a pathogenic variant in BRCA1/2. A thematic analysis of the interview transcripts was completed utilizing the constant comparison method. Qualitative analysis produced three categories of participant advice for men who recently learned of their hereditary cancer risk. Specifically, participants advised the following: (a) know the basics, (b) engage in the family narrative, and (c) advocate for yourself. Results showed the need for men to know and understand their BRCA cancer risks and communicate that genetic risk information to their family members and practitioners. In particular, the findings stress the importance of addressing men's risks and medical management from a family-focused approach.

However, data scarcity has been the roadblock of applying deep learning models directly on prostate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI). Although model interpretation has been heavily studied for natural images for the past few years, there has been a lack of interpretation of deep learning models trained on medical images. In this paper, an efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed and the model interpretation at various convolutional layers was systematically analyzed to improve the understanding of how CNN interprets multimodality medical images and the predictive powers of features at each layer. The problem of small sample size was addressed by feeding the intermediate features into a traditional classification algorithm known as weighted extreme learning machine (wELM), with imbalanced distribution among output categories taken into consideration.  Methods:   The training data collection used a retrospective set of prostate MR studies, from SPIE-AAPM-NCI PROSTATEx Challenges held in 2017. Three hundred twenty biopsy samples of lesions from 201 prostate cancer patients were diagnosed and identified as clinically significant (malignant) or not significant (benign). All studies included T2-weighted (T2W), proton density-weighted (PD-W), dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) and diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging. After registration and lesion-based normalization, a CNN with four convolutional layers were developed and trained on tenfold cross validation. The features from intermediate layers were then extracted as input to wELM to test the discriminative power of each individual layer. The best performing model from the tenfolds was chosen to be tested on the holdout cohort from two sources. Feature maps after each convolutional layer were then visualized to monitor the trend, as the layer propagated. Scatter plotting was used to visualize the transformation of data distribution. Finally, a class activation map was generated to highlight the region of interest based on the model perspective.  Results:   Experimental trials indicated that the best input for CNN was a modality combination of T2W, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and DWIb50 . The convolutional features from CNN paired with a weighted extreme learning classifier showed substantial performance compared to a CNN end-to-end training model. The feature map visualization reveals similar findings on natural images where lower layers tend to learn lower level features such as edges, intensity changes, etc, while higher layers learn more abstract and task-related concept such as the lesion region. The generated saliency map revealed that the model was able to focus on the region of interest where the lesion resided and filter out background information, including prostate boundary, rectum, etc. CONCLUSIONS: This work designs a customized workflow for the small and imbalanced dataset of prostate mpMRI where features were extracted from a deep learning model and then analyzed by a traditional machine learning classifier. In addition, this work contributes to revealing how deep learning models interpret mpMRI for prostate cancer patient stratification.""","""['Weiwei Zong', 'Joon K Lee', 'Chang Liu', 'Eric N Carver', 'Aharon M Feldman', 'Branislava Janic', 'Mohamed A Elshaikh', 'Milan V Pantelic', 'David Hearshen', 'Indrin J Chetty', 'Benjamin Movsas', 'Ning Wen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Co-trained convolutional neural networks for automated detection of prostate cancer in multi-parametric MRI.', 'Semi-automatic classification of prostate cancer on multi-parametric MR imaging using a multi-channel 3D convolutional neural network.', 'Combined Transfer Learning and Test-Time Augmentation Improves Convolutional Neural Network-Based Semantic Segmentation of Prostate Cancer from Multi-Parametric MR Images.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Integrating Patient Data Into Skin Cancer Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks: Systematic Review.', 'Current Value of Biparametric Prostate MRI with Machine-Learning or Deep-Learning in the Detection, Grading, and Characterization of Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Prostate Cancer Patient Management-Current Trends and Future Perspectives.']"""

The goal of this proof-of-concept study was to investigate whether loading of CD19-CAR T cells (CART19) with anti-HER2 or anti-EGFR bispecific antibodies (BiAb) will target HER2+/EGFR+ CD19- targets and signal the intracellular domain of CAR without engaging antigen-specific CD19 ScFv of CAR T cells.  Methods:   We used CART19 armed with anti-CD3 (OKT3) × anti-HER2 BiAb (HER2Bi) or anti-CD3 (OKT3) × anti-EGFR BiAb (EGFRBi) to evaluate the cytotoxicity directed at HER2 or EGFR expressing cancer cell lines compared with unarmed CART19 measured by short-term 51Cr release assay and long-term real-time cell analysis using xCelligence. We also determined the differences in exhaustion or effector phenotypes and cytokine profiles during the short- and long-term cytotoxicity assays.  Results:   Specific cytotoxicity was exhibited by CART19 armed with HER2Bi or EGFRBi against multiple tumor cell lines. Armed CART19 and armed activated T cells (ATC) showed comparable specific cytotoxicity that ranged between 10 and 90% against breast, pancreatic, ovarian, prostate, and lung cancer cell lines at 10:1 E/T ratio. Serial killing (repeated killing) by HER2Bi-armed CART19 ranged between 80 and 100% at 10:1 E/T ratio against MCF-7 cells up to 19 days (up to 4th round of repeated killing) measured by a real-time cell analysis without CART19 becoming exhausted.  Conclusions:   HER2Bi- or EGFRBi-armed CART19 exhibited specific cytotoxicity against multiple HER2+/EGFR+/CD19- tumor targets in overnight and long-term serial killing assays.

One of their important objectives is improvement of quality in cancer care and control.  Methods:   We explored several methodological papers on NCCPs and analyses on their implementation in the European Union as well as recommendations and guidelines concerning prostate cancer screening and management.  Results and discussion:   Quality is still not a very common feature of NCCPs as an independent, self-standing issue. Only a handful of countries structured and implemented specific activities to monitor quality of cancer care in their policy documents. In others, quantitative approaches focusing on epidemiology and provision of care are dominant, not focusing on indicators, especially those of process and outcome. In view of that and exploring its position in a broader sense, prostate cancer is poorly represented and insufficiently addressed, in particular with respect to screening, but also in after-care and survivorship challenges.  Conclusions:   Given that methodological tools on NCCPs envisage quality as a separate chapter and an overarching topic in NCCPs, the current situation shows that we are still a long way away from the goals set. Absence of structured approaches for a cancer, such as prostate cancer, in NCCPs demonstrates the lack of consistency on all phases of comprehensive control on a frequent cancer, where practices and outcomes show unacceptable variations.""","""['Tit Albreht']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Developments in National Cancer Control Programmes in Europe - Results From the Analysis of a Pan-European Survey.', 'An analysis of survivorship care strategies in national cancer control plans in Africa.', 'Cancer Control in Central and Eastern Europe: Current Situation and Recommendations for Improvement.', 'Tuberculosis.', 'Quality of life and economic considerations in the management of prostate cancer.', 'From quality management to quality improvement-structures, processes and outcomes.']"""

In this prospective single-centre service evaluation, we report for the first time in the UK, real-world quality of life (QoL) and survival outcomes, including the sequencing impact, in 228 treated patients. We aim to share our 5-year experience on how to optimise Ra-223 treatment.  Materials and methods:   Patients who received Ra-223 therapy between 2014 and 2018 at the Northern Centre for Cancer Care, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK were included in this evaluation. Demographics, clinical characteristics, blood parameters, treatment sequencing and QoL data using abbreviated Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate questionnaires were prospectively collected and analysed.  Results:   In total, 228 patients were included; median age 72 years (51-87). The medium overall survival was 11.1 months. Overall survival in post-chemotherapy and chemotherapy-naïve patients was 8.1 and 12.3 months, respectively (P = 0.02, hazard ratio 1.52, 95% confidence interval 1.06-2.17); in pre-enzalutamide and post-enzalutamide patients was 11.3 and 10.4 months, respectively (P = 0.65, hazard ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.63-1.33); in pre-abiraterone and prednisolone and post-abiraterone and prednisolone patients was 11.8 and 10.5 months, respectively (P = 0.08, hazard ratio 0.74, 95% confidence interval 0.51-1.06); in this latter group, the fracture rate was 24% (15/63). QoL post Ra-223 (n = 101 evaluated) showed that pain scores improved in 54%, there was no change in 17% and pain scores worsened in 30% of treated patients. Overall QoL scores showed a similar trend. QoL was not significantly associated with overall survival.  Conclusions:   Ra-223 palliates pain and improves disease-related QoL in most patients in the real-world setting. Our survival outcome is comparable with other real-world studies. Chemotherapy-naïve patients seemed to have better survival than those who received prior chemotherapy. No significant survival differences were observed between pre- and post-abiraterone and prednisolone or enzalutamide patients.

Aim:   To assess sexual interest and motivators for sex during ADT and to find out what model of sexuality best describes the sexual experience for men during this treatment.  Methods:   A questionnaire was mailed to patients who had received ADT for ≥6 months. Patients were asked to choose all relevant entities from a list of sexual motivators and between models of sexuality described by Masters and Johnson (excitement and physical experiences), Kaplan (sexual desire), and Basson (intimacy and closeness to partner). Erectile function was assessed by the Erection Hardness Scale, and sexual satisfaction was measured on a scale from 0 to 10.  Outcomes:   Sexual activity, erectile function, sexual satisfaction, and motivators for sexual interest in the study subjects as well as the proportion of participants who endorsed either of the 3 models of sexuality.  Results:   A total of 173 men were invited, and 76 returned the questionnaires (44%). The median age was 76 (range 69-80) years, and the median duration of ADT was 30 months. A total of 62 men had been sexually active before ADT, and of these, 2 were still active. Another 29 were interested in sexual activity. 3 men endorsed the Masters and Johnson model, whereas the remaining participants did not endorse any of the models. The motivators for sexual interest were feeling an emotional connection to the partner (n = 16), sexual desire (n = 10), satisfaction of the partner (n = 8), fear that the partner would leave (n = 4), achieving orgasm (n = 3), and a desire to feel masculine (n = 1). No one was interested in sexual activity to reduce stress or to maintain confidence. Only 1 patient had erections sufficient for penetrative intercourse, and the median sexual satisfaction for the entire group was 0 (interquartile range: 0-5).  Clinical implications:   Sexuality and sexual function should be addressed in men undergoing ADT.  Strengths & limitations:   The main strength of our study is that we are the first to explore both motivators for sexual activity and endorsement of sexual models in men undergoing ADT. The study is limited by the relatively low number of participants and the response rate of 44%.  Conclusion:   ADT is detrimental to sexual function. However, many patients maintain an interest in sexual activity, which does not fit our established models. Rather, factors such as keeping an emotional connection with a partner play a role.

Poor understanding the oncologic and functional outcomes of prostate cancer treatment may influence patient regret during this process. In this study, we assess the association between health literacy, numeracy, prostate-related knowledge and treatment regret in a diverse population.  Materials and methods:   Patients obtaining care between June and August of 2016 at both community-based and academic tertiary care facilities were assessed for health literacy and numeracy using validated instruments. Prostate knowledge was tested in those patients without a history of prostate cancer using a 29-item questionnaire and patient-level predictors of knowledge were assessed. Prostate cancer treatment regret was assessed in those patients who had a history of prostate cancer.  Results:   A total of 90 patients were enrolled, 38 (42%) of whom had a history of prostate cancer. African American race (I = 0.039), financial strain (P < 0.001), and educational attainment (P < 0.001) were all associated with lower health literacy on multivariable analysis. Possessing a professional degree (P = 0.021) and higher health literacy (P = 0.001) were associated with greater prostate-related knowledge. Of those with a history of prostate cancer, 9 (24%) expressed treatment regret. Patients with regret were more likely to be African American (n = 6, 66.7% vs. 5, 17.2%, P = 0.004), not married (P = 0.016), and score lower on the literacy (1.0 vs. 8.0, P = 0.009) and numeracy (10.0 vs. 16.0, P = 0.016) scales.  Conclusions:   We identified lower health literacy among African American men, and lower prostate-related knowledge in those with poor health literacy.

However, its role in prostate cancer is not clearly defined. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the effects and the specific mechanism of PES1 in prostate cancer.  Methods:   A microarray-based analysis was performed to analyze differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between prostate cancer and normal samples. Next, the interaction between PES1 and microRNA-1271 (miR-1271) was investigated using bioinformatics analysis in combination with dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. The expression of miR-1271 in prostate cancer cells and tissues was determined using RT-qPCR. Its effects on downstream estrogen receptor β (ERβ) signaling pathway were further examined. Moreover, we analyzed whether miR-1271 affects proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells by EdU assay, flow cytometry, and Transwell assay. Lastly, a prostate cancer mouse model was conducted to measure their roles in the tumor growth.  Results:   PES1 was identified as a prostate cancer-related DEG and found to be upregulated in prostate cancer. miR-1271, which was poorly expressed in both cells and tissues of prostate cancer, can specifically bind to PES1. Additionally, overexpression of miR-1271 activated the ERβ signaling pathway. Overexpression of miR-1271 or depletion of PES1 inhibited prostate cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion, promoted apoptosis in vitro and suppressed tumor growth in vivo.  Conclusions:   Taken together, overexpression of miR-1271 downregulates PES1 to activate the ERβ signaling pathway, leading to the delayed prostate cancer development.

A subgroup of those patients with mCRPC presents with oligoprogressive disease, with a limited number of progressive lesions while other metastases are still controlled by ongoing systemic treatment.  Methods:   In this single arm prospective phase II trial, we aim to include 18 patients with oligoprogressive mCRPC (1-3 metastases and/or local recurrence) who will be treated with metastasis-directed therapy to all visible progressive lesions. Progression is based on conventional imaging, as the use of PSMA PET-CT is considered investigational. However all patients will undergo PSMA PET-CT and the images will be blinded until progression. Primary endpoint is the postponement of the start of next-line systemic treatment (NEST) and the additional clinical value of PSMA PET-CT. Recruitment of patients for this trial started in January 2020 and will be completed approximately by December 2020.  Discussion:   In this phase 2 trial on oligoprogressive mCRPC, we will investigate the benefit of progression-directed therapy while continuing ongoing systemic treatment. We hypothesize that progression-directed therapy (PDT) with surgery or stereotactic body radiation therapy for these oligoprogressive lesions will postpone the start of next-line systemic treatment and therefore serve as a new or add-on therapy in the spectrum of treatments available for mCRPC. The results of this trial will serve as guidance for a later randomized phase 3 trial. All participants are given an information sheet and are required to give written informed consent.

The alanine serine cysteine transporter-2 (ASCT-2) is the main transporter of glutamine and is upregulated in several tumors. Therefore, a good positron emission tracer targeting this transport protein would have substantial value. Hence, the aim of this study is to develop a fluorine-18-labeled version of a V-9302 analogue, one of the most potent inhibitors of ASCT-2. The precursor was labeled with fluorine-18 via a nucleophilic substitution of the corresponding benzylic bromide. The cold reference product was subjected to in vitro assays with [3 H]glutamine in a PC-3 and F98 cell line to determine the affinity for both the human and rat ASCT-2. To evaluate the tracer potential dynamic μPET, images were acquired in a mouse xenograft model for prostate cancer. The tracer could be synthesized with an overall nondecay corrected yield of 3.66 ± 1.90%. in vitro experiments show inhibitor constants Ki of 90 and 125 μM for the PC-3 and F98 cells, respectively. The experiments in the PC-3 xenograft demonstrate a low uptake in the tumor tissue. We have successfully synthesized the radiotracer [18 F]2-amino-4-((2-((3-fluorobenzyl)oxy)benzyl)(2-((3-(fluoromethyl)benzyl)oxy)benzyl)amino)butanoic acid. in vitro experiments show a good affinity for both the human and rat ASCT-2.

Our primary objective was to report post-operative continence outcomes of patients undergoing this technique. Continence was defined as using zero or one precautionary pad per day. Median follow-up was 24.0 months [interquartile range (IQR) 18.0-30.0 months]. Median age and body mass index were 62.0 years (IQR 57.0-67.0) and 29.0 kg/m2 (IQR 26.0-33.0), respectively. Median PSA was 8.22 ng/ml (IQR 5.74-13.31). 84.8% of patients were intermediate risk or high risk pre-operatively, as per AUA/ASTRO/SUO guidelines. 96.0% had Gleason Score 7 or worse disease on final pathologic analysis. Positive margin incidence was 18.1% and 44.4% in patients with pT2 and pT3 disease, respectively, of which 75.4% were unifocal. Immediate continence (i.e., continence achieved within 1 month post-operatively) was achieved in 45.2% of patients. Three-month and 1-year continence rates were 70.0% and 92.0%, respectively. Caucasian patients experienced earlier return of continence (77% versus 65% at 3 months) compared to African American patients. IPSS scores gradually improved from 8.0 pre-operatively to 4.0 1-year later. Median PSA level was 0.01 ng/ml (IQR 0.01-9.01) post-operatively.

Mean Katz scores and frequency of ADL disability were reported across cancer types for all eight cancers (colon, lung, breast, prostate, bladder, kidney, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, uterine) and by stage and age for the four large cancers (colon, lung, breast, prostate).  Results:   In this sample of 6,973 cancer survivors, ADL deficits were the greatest in uterine cancer survivors (μ = 4.72, SD = 1.44).

Methods:   An exploratory analysis was conducted using data from a prospective, multicenter, paired diagnostic study of 532 men undergoing diagnostics for prostate cancer during 2016-2017. All men underwent 1.5 T MRI; systematic prostate biopsies; and MRI-targeted biopsies to MRI lesions with Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2, PI-RADS ≥ 3. The main outcome was numbers of detected prostate cancer characterized by grade group (GG) where GG ≥ 2 defined clinically significant cancer (csPCa).  Results:   Men with previous biopsies had significantly more often negative MRI (26% vs. 17%, p < 0.05) compared to men without previous biopsies. Men with previous biopsies showed higher rates of benign biopsies (41% vs. 26%, p < 0.05) and lower rates of GG2 (17% vs. 30%, p < 0.05) and GG ≥ 3 (5% vs. 10%, p < 0.05) cancer.

Conclusion:   In this large prospective multicenter trial, we showed that men with a previous prostate biopsy had higher proportions of MRIs without lesions and lower proportion of highly suspicious lesions than biopsy-naïve men. Further, biopsy-naïve men showed higher detection of clinically significant cancer when using MRI-targeted biopsies.

Both techniques, conventional optimization (CO) and robust optimization (RO), create treatment plans with acceptable target coverage and sparing of organs at risk (OAR). While the RO method is less time intensive and may theoretically allow for superior OAR sparing and improved robustness, the CO method can be implemented by institutions who do not have RO capabilities.""","""['Anish A Butala', 'W Scott Ingram', ""Shannon E O'Reilly"", 'Brett Hartl', 'Ali Kassaee', 'Curtiland Deville', 'Neha Vapiwala']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Dosim""","""['Comparison of prostate proton treatment planning technique, interfraction robustness, and analysis of single-field treatment feasibility.', 'Initial Report of Pencil Beam Scanning Proton Therapy for Posthysterectomy Patients With Gynecologic Cancer.', 'Comparison of linear and nonlinear programming approaches for ""worst case dose"" and ""minmax"" robust optimization of intensity-modulated proton therapy dose distributions.', 'A novel approach to postmastectomy radiation therapy using scanned proton beams.', 'Clinical controversies: proton therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Consensus Statement on Proton Therapy for Prostate Cancer.']"""

Ancestry-specific analyses of germline genomes are required to inform cancer genetic risk and prognosis of diverse populations.  Methods:   We conducted analyses using germline and somatic sequencing data generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas. Collapsing pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants to cancer predisposition genes (CPG), we analyzed the association between CPGs and cancer types within ancestral groups. We also identified the predisposition-associated two-hit events and gene expression effects in tumors.  Results:   Genetic ancestry analysis classified the cohort of 9899 cancer cases into individuals of primarily European (N = 8184, 82.7%), African (N = 966, 9.8%), East Asian (N = 649, 6.6%), South Asian (N = 48, 0.5%), Native/Latin American (N = 41, 0.4%), and admixed (N = 11, 0.1%) ancestries. In the African ancestry, we discovered a potentially novel association of BRCA2 in lung squamous cell carcinoma (OR = 41.4 [95% CI, 6.1-275.6]; FDR = 0.002) previously identified in Europeans, along with a known association of BRCA2 in ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OR = 8.5 [95% CI, 1.5-47.4]; FDR = 0.045). In the East Asian ancestry, we discovered one previously known association of BRIP1 in stomach adenocarcinoma (OR = 12.8 [95% CI, 1.8-90.8]; FDR = 0.038). Rare variant burden analysis further identified 7 suggestive associations in African ancestry individuals previously described in European ancestry, including SDHB in pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, ATM in prostate adenocarcinoma, VHL in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, FH in kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, and PTEN in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma. Most predisposing variants were found exclusively in one ancestry in the TCGA and gnomAD datasets. Loss of heterozygosity was identified for 7 out of the 15 African ancestry carriers of predisposing variants. Further, tumors from the SDHB or BRCA2 carriers showed simultaneous allelic-specific expression and low gene expression of their respective affected genes, and FH splice-site variant carriers showed mis-splicing of FH.  Conclusions:   While several CPGs are shared across patients, many pathogenic variants are found to be ancestry-specific and trigger somatic effects.

UM is itself a common cause of CKD. Understanding the associations of UM with outcomes in advanced CKD can help in optimisation of the management of these patients. This study investigates the distribution and association of urological malignancy with outcomes (renal progression and mortality) in patients with advanced non-dialysis dependent CKD.  Methods:   The study was conducted in 2637 of 3115 patients recruited in the Salford Kidney Study between the years 2002 and 2016. A comparative analysis was performed between 160 patients with UM (at baseline and incident) and 2477 patients with no malignancy. Cox-regression models and Kaplan-Meir estimates were used to explore the association between the presence of UM with mortality and renal outcome. Linear regression analysis was used to calculate the rate of progression of CKD in the groups. A 1:3 propensity score matched cohort of 640 patients was generated and utilised in the above analyses.  Results:   4.4% had a history of UM at baseline with the annual incident rate being 0.37%. The site of malignancy was the kidney in 40% with comparable numbers for prostatic malignancy (39%). 70% (111/160) of UM patients had a medical cause as their primary diagnosis for CKD. Over a median follow up of 4 years, 34% (905) patients died. In the matched sample, the proportion of deaths was similar between the groups (UM 44% versus no malignancy 48%, p = 0.36). 30% reached end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with no difference between the groups. In the Cox-regression model, UM did not prove to be a risk factor associated with either all-cause mortality (HR:1.03; CI: 0.79-1.35; p = 0.81) or reaching ESRD (HR:1.12; CI: 0.80-1.58; p = 0.49). The rate of decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was similar between the groups (- 1.05 vs - 1.25 mL/min/1.73m2/year, p = 0.31).  Conclusions:   There was no correlation observed between UM and all-cause mortality or ESRD. Medical causes of CKD have a significant influence on the outcomes in patients with UM, whereas the UM did not. Hence, a coordinated approach with early liaison between the urology and nephrology teams is needed in the management of UM patients with CKD.""","""['Rajkumar Chinnadurai', 'Noel W Clarke', 'Philip A Kalra']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Nephrol""","""['Cancer patterns and association with mortality and renal outcomes in non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease: a matched cohort study.', 'Advanced chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease and renal death among HIV-positive individuals in Europe.', 'Progression and outcomes of non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease patients: A single center longitudinal follow-up study.', 'Role of chronic kidney disease in cardiovascular disease: are we different from others?', 'Nephrolithiasis and loss of kidney function.', 'Proteomic signature associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression identified by data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry.', 'Investigating the utility of COVID-19 antibody testing in end-stage renal disease patients receiving haemodialysis: a cohort study in the United Kingdom.']"""

In a second step (segmentation phase), this intermediate plan is then converted into a deliverable treatment plan with MLC segments. In this paper, we investigate novel approaches for the use of a clinical dose engine (CDE) for segmentation of FMO plans in robotic radiotherapy. Segments are sequentially added to the plan. Generation of each next segment is based on the total 3D dose distribution, resulting from already selected segments and the desired FMO dose, considering all treatment beams as candidates for delivery of the new segment. Three versions of the segmentation algorithm were investigated with differences in the integration of the CDE. The combined use of pencil-beams and segments in a segmentation method is non-trivial. Therefore, new methods were developed for the use of segment doses calculated with the CDE in combination with pencil-beams, used for the selection of new segments. For 20 patients with prostate cancer and 12 with liver cancer, segmented plans were compared with FMO plans. All three versions of the proposed segmentation algorithm could well mimic FMO dose distributions. Segmentation with a fully integrated CDE provided the best plan quality and lowest numbers of monitor units and segments at the cost of increased calculation time.""","""['B W K Schipaanboord', 'B Heijmen', 'S Breedveld']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Fully automated treatment planning for MLC-based robotic radiotherapy.', 'Automated prioritised 3D dose-based MLC segment generation for step-and-shoot IMRT.', 'Computerized triplet beam orientation optimization for MRI-guided Co-60 radiotherapy.', 'Impact of IMRT and leaf width on stereotactic body radiotherapy of liver and lung lesions.', 'Dose domain regularization of MLC leaf patterns for highly complex IMRT plans.', 'Inter- and intrafraction dose variations in robotic stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma in the prospective phase I STRONG trial.', 'Fully automated treatment planning for MLC-based robotic radiotherapy.']"""

Prostate cancer is typically classified into one of 5 different categories with 1 representing the most indolent disease and 5 reflecting the most aggressive disease. Grades 3 and 4 are the most common and difficult patterns to be discriminated in clinical practice. Even though the degree of gland differentiation is the strongest determinant of Gleason grade, manual grading is subjective and is hampered by substantial inter-reader disagreement, especially with regard to intermediate grade groups.  Methods:   To capture the topological characteristics and the degree of connectivity between nuclei around the gland, the concept of Homology Profile (HP) for prostate cancer grading is presented in this paper. HP is an algebraic tool, whereby, certain algebraic invariants are computed based on the structure of a topological space. We utilized the Statistical Representation of Homology Profile (SRHP) features to quantify the extent of glandular differentiation. The quantitative characteristics which represent the image patch are fed into a supervised classifier model for discrimination of grade patterns 3 and 4.  Results:   On the basis of the novel homology profile, we evaluated 43 digitized images of prostate biopsy slides annotated for regions corresponding to Grades 3 and 4. The quantitative patch-level evaluation results showed that our approach achieved an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.96 and an accuracy of 0.89 in terms of discriminating Grade 3 and 4 patches. Our approach was found to be superior to comparative methods including handcrafted cellular features, Stacked Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE) algorithm and end-to-end supervised learning method (DLGg). Also, slide-level quantitative and qualitative evaluation results reflect the ability of our approach in discriminating Gleason Grade 3 from 4 patterns on H&E tissue images.  Conclusions:   We presented a novel Statistical Representation of Homology Profile (SRHP) approach for automated Gleason grading on prostate biopsy slides. The most discriminating topological descriptions of cancerous regions for grade 3 and 4 in prostate cancer were identified. Moreover, these characteristics of homology profile are interpretable, visually meaningful and highly consistent with the rubric employed by pathologists for the task of Gleason grading.""","""['Chaoyang Yan', 'Kazuaki Nakane', 'Xiangxue Wang', 'Yao Fu', 'Haoda Lu', 'Xiangshan Fan', 'Michael D Feldman', 'Anant Madabhushi', 'Jun Xu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Comput Methods Programs Biomed""","""['Self-Learning for Weakly Supervised Gleason Grading of Local Patterns.', 'Automated deep-learning system for Gleason grading of prostate cancer using biopsies: a diagnostic study.', 'Going deeper through the Gleason scoring scale: An automatic end-to-end system for histology prostate grading and cribriform pattern detection.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.', 'An update of the Gleason grading system.', 'Histopathological Tissue Segmentation of Lung Cancer with Bilinear CNN and Soft Attention.', 'Development of ""Mathematical Technology for Cytopathology,"" an Image Analysis Algorithm for Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Homology-Based Image Processing for Automatic Classification of Histopathological Images of Lung Tissue.', 'GestAltNet: aggregation and attention to improve deep learning of gestational age from placental whole-slide images.']"""

Results:   In AR- PCa cell line PC3, dexamethasone upregulated GAS5 expression, induced cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase and inhibited cell proliferation, which were enhanced by GAS5 overexpression and attenuated by GAS5 silencing. However, in AR+ PCa cell line 22Rv1, dexamethasone had no obvious effects on GAS5 expression, cell cycle distribution and cell proliferation.

Neutral-avidin was then coupled on ZGC surface through the specific biotin-avidin interaction, producing a ZGC-PEG-avidin nanoprobe. As for cell surface glycan detection, different surface glycans are recognized with their corresponding biotinylated lectins, which are then traced by ZGC-PEG-avidin. The persistent luminescence signal is recorded by a microtiter plate reader in time-resolved fluorescence mode.

Results from the final analysis of overall survival have not yet been reported.  Methods:   In this double-blind, phase 3 trial, men with nonmetastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (defined on the basis of conventional imaging and a PSA doubling time of ≤10 months) who were continuing to receive androgen-deprivation therapy were randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) to receive enzalutamide at a dose of 160 mg or placebo once daily. Overall survival was assessed with a group sequential testing procedure and an O'Brien-Fleming-type alpha-spending function.  Results:   As of October 15, 2019, a total of 288 of 933 patients (31%) in the enzalutamide group and 178 of 468 (38%) in the placebo group had died.

Methods:   In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients with advanced prostate cancer, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive relugolix (120 mg orally once daily) or leuprolide (injections every 3 months) for 48 weeks. The primary end point was sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels (<50 ng per deciliter) through 48 weeks. Secondary end points included noninferiority with respect to the primary end point, castrate levels of testosterone on day 4, and profound castrate levels (<20 ng per deciliter) on day 15. Testosterone recovery was evaluated in a subgroup of patients.  Results:   A total of 622 patients received relugolix and 308 received leuprolide.

The difference of 7.9 percentage points (95% CI, 4.1 to 11.8) showed noninferiority and superiority of relugolix (P<0.001 for superiority). All other key secondary end points showed superiority of relugolix over leuprolide (P<0.001). The percentage of patients with castrate levels of testosterone on day 4 was 56.0% with relugolix and 0% with leuprolide. In the subgroup of 184 patients followed for testosterone recovery, the mean testosterone levels 90 days after treatment discontinuation were 288.4 ng per deciliter in the relugolix group and 58.6 ng per deciliter in the leuprolide group.

M1-polarized macrophage mediates rapid inflammation, entity clearance and may also cause inflammation-induced mutagenesis. M2-polarized macrophage inhibits rapid inflammation but can promote tumour aggravation. ω-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-derived metabolites show a strong anti-inflammatory effect because they can skew macrophage polarization from M1 to M2. However, their role in tumour promotive M2 macrophage is still unknown. Resolvin D1 and D2 (RvD1 and RvD2) are docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-derived docosanoids converted by 15-lipoxygenase then 5-lipoxygenase successively. We found that although dietary DHA can inhibit prostate cancer in vivo, neither DHA (10 μmol/L) nor RvD (100 nmol/L) can directly inhibit the proliferation of prostate cancer cells in vitro. Unexpectedly, in a cancer cell-macrophage co-culture system, both DHA and RvD significantly inhibited cancer cell proliferation. RvD1 and RvD2 inhibited tumour-associated macrophage (TAM or M2d) polarization. Meanwhile, RvD1 and RvD2 also exhibited anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting LPS-interferon (IFN)-γ-induced M1 polarization as well as promoting interleukin-4 (IL-4)-mediated M2a polarization. These differential polarization processes were mediated, at least in part, by protein kinase A. These results suggest that regulation of macrophage polarization using RvDs may be a potential therapeutic approach in the management of prostate cancer.""","""['Kai Shan', 'Ninghan Feng', 'Jing Cui', 'Shunhe Wang', 'Hongyan Qu', 'Guoling Fu', 'Jiaqi Li', 'Heyan Chen', 'Xiaoying Wang', 'Rong Wang', 'Yumin Qi', 'Zhennan Gu', 'Yong Q Chen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Cell Mol Med""","""['Prostaglandin E3 attenuates macrophage-associated inflammation and prostate tumour growth by modulating polarization.', 'D-series resolvins inhibit murine abdominal aortic aneurysm formation and increase M2 macrophage polarization.', 'Docosahexaenoic acid enhances M2 macrophage polarization via the p38 signaling pathway and autophagy.', 'Macrophage Polarization States in the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Tumor-associated macrophages: A promising target for a cancer immunotherapeutic strategy.', 'Overexpression of ferritin light chain as a poor prognostic factor for breast cancer.', 'Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids: Conversion to Lipid Mediators, Roles in Inflammatory Diseases and Dietary Sources.', 'Osteoid cell-derived chemokines drive bone-metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Lipid metabolism reprogramming in tumor-associated macrophages and implications for therapy.', 'Resolvin D1/N-formyl peptide receptor 2 ameliorates paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain through the activation of IL-10/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in mice.']"""

However, previous studies have shown that the combination treatment of nonselective TRPM7 channel inhibitors (2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate and Gd3+ ) with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) increases antiproliferative effects and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells and hepatic stellate cells. We, therefore, investigated the potential role of TRPM7 in proliferation and apoptosis of TNBC cells (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells) with TRAIL. We demonstrated that suppression of TRPM7 via TRPM7 knockdown or pharmacological inhibition synergistically increases TRAIL-induced antiproliferative effects and apoptosis in TNBC cells. Furthermore, we showed that the synergistic interaction might be associated with TRPM7 channel activities using combination treatments of TRAIL and TRPM7 inhibitors (NS8593 as a TRPM7 channel inhibitor and TG100-115 as a TRPM7 kinase inhibitor). We reveal that downregulation of cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein via inhibition of Ca2+ influx might be involved in the synergistic interaction.

Yet, most cancers show only modest levels of TERT gene expression, even in the context of activating hotspot promoter mutations (C228T and C250T). The role of epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, in regulating TERT gene expression in cancer cells is as yet not fully understood.  Methods:   Here, we have carried out the most comprehensive characterization to date of TERT promoter methylation using ultra-deep bisulfite sequencing spanning the CpG island surrounding the core TERT promoter in 96 different human cell lines, including primary, immortalized and cancer cell types, as well as in control and reference samples.  Results:   In general, we observed that immortalized and cancer cell lines were hypermethylated in a region upstream of the recurrent C228T and C250T TERT promoter mutations, while non-malignant primary cells were comparatively hypomethylated in this region. However, at the allele-level, we generally found that hypermethylation of promoter sequences in cancer cells is associated with repressed expression, and the remaining unmethylated alleles marked with open chromatin are largely responsible for the observed TERT expression in cancer cells.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that hypermethylation of the TERT promoter alleles signals transcriptional repression of those alleles, leading to attenuation of TERT activation in cancer cells. This type of fine tuning of TERT expression may account for the modest activation of TERT expression in most cancers.""","""['David Esopi', 'Mindy Kim Graham', 'Jacqueline A Brosnan-Cashman', 'Jennifer Meyers', 'Ajay Vaghasia', 'Anuj Gupta', 'Balasubramanian Kumar', 'Michael C Haffner', 'Christopher M Heaphy', 'Angelo M De Marzo', 'Alan K Meeker', 'William G Nelson', 'Sarah J Wheelan', 'Srinivasan Yegnasubramanian']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cell Oncol (Dordr)""","""['Allele-specific proximal promoter hypomethylation of the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (TERT) associates with TERT expression in multiple cancers.', 'Allele-Specific DNA Methylation and Its Interplay with Repressive Histone Marks at Promoter-Mutant TERT Genes.', 'Interplay between TERT promoter mutations and methylation culminates in chromatin accessibility and TERT expression.', 'Reactivation of telomerase in cancer.', 'DNA methylation of the TERT promoter and its impact on human cancer.', 'Targeted Long-Read Bisulfite Sequencing Identifies Differences in the TERT Promoter Methylation Profiles between TERT Wild-Type and TERT Mutant Cancer Cells.', 'Correlation of molecular alterations with pathological features in hepatocellular carcinoma: Literature review and experience of an Italian center.', 'The expression level of chicken telomerase reverse transcriptase in tumors induced by ALV-J is positively correlated with methylation and mutation of its promoter region.', 'Dual role of allele-specific DNA hypermethylation within the TERT promoter in cancer.', 'miR-142-5p Inhibits Cell Invasion and Migration by Targeting DNMT1 in Breast Cancer.']"""

In contrast to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, computed tomography (CT) has only limited capacity to detect lymph node metastases (LNM). We sought to develop a CT-based radiomic model to predict LNM status using a PSMA radioguided surgery (RGS) cohort with histological confirmation of all suspected lymph nodes (LNs).  Methods:   Eighty patients that received RGS for resection of PSMA PET/CT-positive LNMs were analyzed. Forty-seven patients (87 LNs) that received inhouse imaging were used as training cohort. Thirty-three patients (62 LNs) that received external imaging were used as testing cohort. As gold standard, histological confirmation was available for all LNs. After preprocessing, 156 radiomic features analyzing texture, shape, intensity, and local binary patterns (LBP) were extracted. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (radiomic models) and logistic regression (conventional parameters) were used for modeling.  Results:   Texture and shape features were largely correlated to LN volume. A combined radiomic model achieved the best predictive performance with a testing-AUC of 0.95. LBP features showed the highest contribution to model performance. This model significantly outperformed all conventional CT parameters including LN short diameter (AUC 0.84), LN volume (AUC 0.80), and an expert rating (AUC 0.67). In lymph node-specific decision curve analysis, there was a clinical net benefit above LN short diameter.  Conclusion:   The best radiomic model outperformed conventional measures for detection of LNM demonstrating an incremental value of radiomic features.""","""['Jan C Peeken', 'Mohamed A Shouman', 'Markus Kroenke', 'Isabel Rauscher', 'Tobias Maurer', 'Jürgen E Gschwend', 'Matthias Eiber', 'Stephanie E Combs']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Metastases-yield and Prostate-specific Antigen Kinetics Following Salvage Lymph Node Dissection for Prostate Cancer: A Comparison Between Conventional Surgical Approach and Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-radioguided Surgery.', 'Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-radioguided Surgery Facilitates Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection During Radical Prostatectomy for the Treatment of Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer with Regional Lymph Node Metastases.', 'Diagnostic Accuracy of Ga-68-HBED-CC-PSMA-Ligand-PET/CT before Salvage Lymph Node Dissection for Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen-guided salvage lymph node dissection in recurrent prostate cancer: a novel technology to detect lymph node metastases.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'Optimal 18F-FDG PET/CT radiomics model development for predicting EGFR mutation status and prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma: a multicentric study.', 'Dosiomics and radiomics to predict pneumonitis after thoracic stereotactic body radiotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibition.', 'Development of PSMA-PET-guided CT-based radiomic signature to predict biochemical recurrence after salvage radiotherapy.', 'Novel, alternative splicing signature to detect lymph node metastasis in prostate adenocarcinoma with machine learning.', 'Feasibility of a CT-based lymph node radiomics nomogram in detecting lymph node metastasis in PDAC patients.']"""

However, its clinical usefulness is still unknown within the so-called gray area of PSA values. This study aimed to determine whether updating the PBCGRC improves its predictive performance for predicting any-grade and high-grade (HG), defined as biopsy Gleason score ≥ 7, prostate cancer (PCa) in patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) less than 10 ng/ml.  Methods:   The risk of any-grade and HGPCa was calculated using the PBCG risk calculation formulas updated by recalibration in the large, logistic recalibration and model revision. Predictive performances of the PBCGRC and the updated models were compared using discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility.  Results:   Within the study sample of 526 patients, PCa was detected in 193 (36.7%), and 78 (14.8%) of them had HGPCa. According to the calibration curves, the PBCGRC overestimated the risk of PCa. Predictive accuracy of the revised model was higher [the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUCs), 65.4% and 70.2%] than that of the PBCGRC (AUCs, 60.4% and 64.3%) for any-grade and HGPCa. The net benefit was greater for model revision in comparison with the original model.  Conclusion:   The performance accuracy of PBCGRC for the prediction of any and HGPC in men undergoing prostate biopsy with PSA levels below 10 ng/ml is suboptimal.

However, the function of TAZ in prostate cancer cells has not been investigated. In the present study, TAZ expression in prostate cancer (PCa) and benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues, PCa cell lines, and normal prostate epithelial cells was determined with the use of immunohistochemistry. TAZ was knocked down by shRNA in the PC3 cells, a prostate cancer cell line, and cell viability and migration assays were performed to determine the biological functions of TAZ. A mouse subcutaneous xenograft model was used to determine the in vivo effects of TAZ knockdown on tumor growth. We demonstrated that TAZ is overexpressed in PCa tissues, and the expression levels were found to be positively correlated with the Gleason scores of cancer grade. Moreover, TAZ knockdown inhibited PC3 cell proliferation, reduced cell migration, and induced apoptosis. Further experiments demonstrated that TAZ knockdown may lead to PC3 cell apoptosis through the exogenous apoptotic pathway by inducing the expression and cleavage of caspase‑4 and ‑7. In the tumor xenograft model, TAZ knockdown led to a decreased tumor growth rate. Taken together, the experimental results indicate that TAZ plays a significant role in the proliferation, migration and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells.

Telomere shortening is the most frequently observed genetic alteration in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and is associated with poor clinical outcomes in prostate cancer. Gene expression database analysis revealed decreased TRF2 expression during malignant progression of the prostate gland. We reasoned that reduced TRF2 expression in prostate epithelium, by activating the telomere DNA damage response, would allow us to model both benign and malignant prostate disease. Prostate glands with reduced epithelial TRF2 expression developed age- and p53-dependent hypertrophy, senescence, ductal dilation, and smooth muscle hyperplasia similar to human BPH. Prostate tumors with reduced TRF2 expression were classified as high-grade androgen receptor-negative adenocarcinomas, which exhibited decreased latency, increased proliferation, and distant metastases. Prostate cancer stem cells with reduced TRF2 expression were highly tumorigenic and maintained telomeres both by telomerase and alternative lengthening (ALT). Telomerase inhibition in prostate glands with reduced TRF2 expression produced significant reduction in prostate tumor incidence by halting progression at intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). These lesions were highly differentiated, exhibited low proliferation index, and high apoptotic cell fraction. Prostate tumors with reduced TRF2 expression and telomerase inhibition failed to metastasize and did not exhibit ALT.

It inhibits AR nuclear translocation, DNA binding and transcription of AR gene targets. As dysregulation of autophagy has been detected in PC, the targeting of autophagy is a potential approach to overcome early therapeutic resistance. Therefore, we investigated the characteristics of autophagic response to ARN-509 treatment and evaluated the potential effect of a combination with autophagy inhibition.  Methods:   Human prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) were cultivated in a steroid-free medium. Cells were treated with ARN-509 (50 µM) alone or in combination with the autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenine (3MA, 5 mM) or chloroquine (Chl, 20 µM) or with ATG5 siRNA knock-down. Cell viability and apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Autophagy was monitored by immunohistochemistry, AUTOdot and immunoblotting (WES).  Results:   Treatment with ARN-509 led to cell death of up to 37% with 50 µM and 60% with 100 µM by day 7. The combination of 50 µM ARN-509 with autophagy inhibitors produced a further increase in cell death by day 7. Immunostaining results showed that ARN-509 induced autophagy in LNCaP cells as evidenced by elevated levels of ATG5, Beclin 1 and LC3 punctuation and by an increase in the LC3-II band detected by WES. Autophagic flux was restored by the treatment of cells with Chl, intensifying the LC3-II band. These findings were further supported by an enhanced autophagosome punctuation observed by Autodot staining.  Conclusions:   These data demonstrate that treatment with ARN-509 leads to increased autophagy levels in LNCaP cells. Furthermore, in combination with autophagy inhibitors, ARN-509 provided a significantly elevated antitumor effect, thus providing a new therapeutic approach potentially translatable to patients.""","""['Daniel Eberli', 'Benedikt Kranzbühler', 'Ashkan Mortezavi', 'Tullio Sulser', 'Souzan Salemi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Apalutamide and autophagy inhibition in a xenograft mouse model of human prostate cancer.', 'Combined N-terminal androgen receptor and autophagy inhibition increases the antitumor effect in enzalutamide sensitive and enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Inhibition of autophagy significantly increases the antitumor effect of Abiraterone in prostate cancer.', 'Apalutamide: the established and emerging roles in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.', 'Apalutamide: A new agent in the management of prostate cancer.', 'Mechanisms of Prostate Cancer Cells Survival and Their Therapeutic Targeting.', 'STEAP1 regulation and its influence modulating the response of LNCaP prostate cancer cells to bicalutamide, enzalutamide and apalutamide.', 'Apalutamide and autophagy inhibition in a xenograft mouse model of human prostate cancer.', 'Absence of PSA Flare With Apalutamide Administered 1 Hour in Advance With GnRH Agonists: Case Report.', 'Novel Insights into Autophagy and Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review.']"""

Most antibody immunotherapies have not succeeded in prostate cancer. We showed previously that high-risk PCa patients have a higher density of tumor infiltrating B-cells in prostatectomy specimens. In mouse models, anti-CD20 antibody ablation of B-cells delayed PCa regrowth post-treatment. We sought to determine whether neoadjuvant anti-CD20 immunotherapy with rituximab could reduce CD20+ B cell infiltration of prostate tumors in patients.  Methods:   An open label, single arm clinical trial enrolled eight high-risk PCa patients to receive one cycle of neoadjuvant rituximab prior to prostatectomy. Eleven clinical specimens with similar characteristics were selected as controls. Treated and control samples were concurrently stained for CD20 and digitally scanned in a blinded fashion. A new method of digital image quantification of lymphocytes was applied to prostatectomy sections of treated and control cases. CD20 density was quantified by a deconvolution algorithm in pathologist-marked tumor and adjacent regions. Statistical significance was assessed by one sided Welch's t-test, at 0.05 level using a gatekeeper strategy. Secondary outcomes included CD3+ T-cell and PD-L1 densities.  Results:   Mean CD20 density in the tumor regions of the treated group was significantly lower than the control group (p = 0.02). Mean CD3 density in the tumors was significantly decreased in the treated group (p = 0.01). CD20, CD3 and PD-L1 staining primarily occurred in tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS). Neoadjuvant rituximab was well-tolerated and decreased B-cell and T-cell density within high-risk PCa tumors compared to controls.  Conclusions:   This is the first study to treat patients prior to surgical prostate removal with an immunotherapy that targets B-cells. Rituximab treatment reduced tumor infiltrating B and T-cell density especially in TLSs, thus, demonstrating inter-dependence between B- and T-cells in prostate cancer and that Rituximab can modify the immune environment in prostate tumors. Future studies will determine who may benefit from using rituximab to improve their immune response against prostate cancer.

Methods and materials:   Twenty patients with intermediate-high prostate cancer treated with radical radiation therapy were enrolled. The first step of the offline adaptive RT strategy is the identification of a patient-specific internal target volume based on the kV cone beam computed tomography (kV-CBCT) data sets acquired during the first 5 fractions. The deformable image registration algorithm ANACONDA was used to propagate the clinical target volumes (CTVs) from the reference-planning computed tomography to the CBCTs; these contours were assessed by a radiation oncologist. In the second step, the internal target volume was used to replan the treatment using a min-max robust algorithm based on the worst scenario optimization. The CTV coverage and organs-at-risk sparing achieved with the robust plan (RP) were analyzed and compared with the original standard plan, calculating the dose distributions on the residual CBCTs.  Results:   The RP was shown to achieve optimal coverage of the CTV even in the worst scenario, with significantly lower doses to the rectum and bladder. CTV coverage of the RP was statistically better than the standard plan in terms of D99 (P = .008) and D98 (P = .02). Statistically significant mean dose reduction and D2 reduction were noted for the rectum (P < .05) and bladder (P < .009). Moreover, the RP appeared to be less sensitive to bladder and rectal filling.

Our objective was to determine the impact of 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT on treatment decisions for men planning to undergo sRT for biochemical recurrence post-RP.  Methods and materials:   We conducted a subgroup analysis of post-RP patients enrolled in LOCATE who were planning to undergo sRT with or without hormonal therapy based on prescan documentation. 18F-Fluciclovine PET/CT was performed according to standardized procedures. The treatment plan postscan was compared with the prescan plan, and Fisher exact test was used to determine the impact of prescan prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and Gleason sum (GS) on positivity and anatomic patterns of uptake.  Results:   A total of 114 patients (median prescan PSA 0.42 [interquartile range, 0.3-1.1] ng/mL) met selection criteria (54% of patients in LOCATE). Forty-eight (42%) had 18F-fluciclovine-avid lesions. Twelve patients (11%) had positive findings only in the prostate bed, 24 (21%) had positivity only in the pelvis (prostate bed or pelvic nodes), and 24 (21%) had extrapelvic findings. PSA >0.5 ng/mL and GS ≥8 were associated with a higher risk of extrapelvic positivity (P < .05). Postscan, 55 (48%) patients had a management change; 37 (32%) had a change in overall treatment approach (ie, omission of sRT); and 18 (16%) had sRT target modification.  Conclusions: 18F-Fluciclovine PET/CT is positive in nearly half of patients planning to undergo post-RP sRT with negative/equivocal conventional imaging, with findings frequently leading to changes in management. PSA >0.5 ng/mL and GS ≥8 are associated with a higher risk of extrapelvic positive findings.""","""['Abhishek A Solanki', 'Bital Savir-Baruch', 'Stanley L Liauw', 'Jeff Michalski', 'Jonathan D Tward', 'Neha Vapiwala', 'Eugene J Teoh;LOCATE study group']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Prostate cancer recurrence in patients with negative or equivocal conventional imaging: A role for 18F-fluciclovine-PET/CT in delineating sites of recurrence and identifying patients with oligometastatic disease.', 'Impact of 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT on plans for androgen deprivation therapy in patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer: data analysis from two prospective clinical trials.', 'Impact of 18 F-Fluciclovine PET/CT Findings on Failure-Free Survival in Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer Following Salvage Radiation Therapy.', 'Use and Impact of Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Prior to Salvage Radiation Therapy in Men with Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy: A Scoping Review.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'Differences in Failure-Free Survival After Salvage Radiotherapy Guided by Conventional Imaging Versus 18F-Fluciclovine PET/CT in Postprostatectomy Patients: A Post Hoc Substratification Analysis of the EMPIRE-1 Trial.', 'Impact of 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT on salvage radiotherapy plans for men with recurrence of prostate cancer postradical prostatectomy.', 'Salvage Radiotherapy Management Decisions in Postprostatectomy Patients with Recurrent Prostate Cancer Based on 18F-Fluciclovine PET/CT Guidance.']"""

Method:   Between 2000 and 2018, 1094 men were operated on for rectal cancer in our institution. All men with T2/T3 mid and low rectal cancer with preoperative radiotherapy and restorative TME were considered for this study (n = 416). Patients with external-beam high-dose radiotherapy (EBHRT) for prostate cancer (70-78 Gy) were identified and compared with patients with conventional long-course chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by TME. We compared our already published historical cohort (2000-2012), including arm A (CRT + TME; n = 236) and arm B (EBHRT + TME; n = 12), with our early cohort (2013-2018), including arm C (CRT + TME; n = 158) and arm D (EBHRT + TME-DCAA; n = 10). The end-points were morbidity, pelvic sepsis, reoperation rate and quality of the specimen.  Results:   Overall morbidity was not significantly different between groups. Pelvic sepsis decreased from 50% (arm B) to 10% (arm D) with the use of DCAA (P = 0.074), and was similar between arms A, C and D.

Additionally, conflicting reports exist on load-mediated hypertrophy during ADT and if protein supplementation offsets these deficits. This study sought to determine the role of testosterone suppression and a high-protein diet on 1) immobilization-induced atrophy and 2) muscle regrowth during reloading. Eight-week-old male Fischer 344 rats underwent sham surgery (Sham), castration surgery (ORX), or ORX and a high-casein diet supplemented with branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) (ORX+CAS/AA) followed by 10 days of unilateral immobilization (IMM) and 0, 6, or 14 days of reloading. With IMM, body mass gains were ~8% greater than ORX and ORX+CAS/AA that increased to 15% during reloading (both P < 0.01). IMM reduced muscle mass by 11-34% (all P < 0.01) and extensor digitorum longus and soleus (SOL) force by 21% and 49% (both P < 0.01), respectively, with no group differences. During reloading, castration reduced gastrocnemius mass (~12%) at 6 days and SOL mass (~20%) and SOL force recovery (~46%) at 14 days relative to Sham (all P < 0.05). Specific force reduced castration deficits, indicating that muscle atrophy was a key contributor. IMM decreased SOL cross-sectional area by 30.3% (P < 0.001), with a trend for reduced regrowth in ORX and ORX+CAS/AA following reloading (P = 0.083). Castration did not exacerbate disuse atrophy but may impair recovery of muscle function, with no benefit from a CAS/AA diet during reloading. Examining functional outcomes in addition to muscle mass during dietary interventions provides novel insights into muscle regrowth during ADT.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Low testosterone levels during skeletal muscle disuse did not worsen declines in muscle mass and function, although hypogonadism may attenuate recovery during subsequent reloading. Diets high in casein did not improve outcomes during immobilization or reloading. Practical strategies are needed that do not compromise caloric intake yet provide effective protein doses to augment these adverse effects.""","""['Erik D Hanson', 'Andrew C Betik', 'Cara A Timpani', 'John Tarle', 'Xinmei Zhang', 'Alan Hayes']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Appl Physiol (1985)""","""['Deletion of muscle Igf1 exacerbates disuse atrophy weakness in mice.', 'Gonadectomy and reduced physical activity: effects on skeletal muscle.', 'Global deletion of CCL2 has adverse impacts on recovery of skeletal muscle fiber size and function and is muscle specific.', 'Skeletal Muscle Disuse Atrophy and the Rehabilitative Role of Protein in Recovery from Musculoskeletal Injury.', 'Skeletal Muscle Recovery from Disuse Atrophy: Protein Turnover Signaling and Strategies for Accelerating Muscle Regrowth.', 'Influence of gonadectomy on muscle health in micro- and partial-gravity environments in rats.', 'Murine Models of Tenotomy-Induced Mechanical Overloading and Tail-Suspension-Induced Mechanical Unloading.', 'Abstracts of the 2023 Padua Days of Muscle and Mobility Medicine (2023Pdm3) to be held March 29 - April 1 at the Galileian Academy of Padua and at the Petrarca Hotel, Thermae of Euganean Hills, Padua, Italy.', 'The Effects of Calcium-β-Hydroxy-β-Methylbutyrate on Aging-Associated Apoptotic Signaling and Muscle Mass and Function in Unloaded but Nonatrophied Extensor Digitorum Longus Muscles of Aged Rats.']"""

Because osimertinib prolongs PFS compared with erlotinib, this trial was designed to study the combination of osimertinib and bevacizumab as first-line treatment.  Objectives:   To determine the safety and tolerability of osimertinib and bevacizumab combination treatment and assess the 12-month PFS of the combination in patients with metastatic EGFR-mutant lung cancers.  Design, setting, and particiants:   From August 15, 2016, to May 15, 2018, 49 patients with metastatic EGFR-mutant lung cancers were enrolled in this interventional clinical trial, conducted at a single academic cancer center. In the phase 1 portion of the study, a standard 3 + 3 dose de-escalation design was used to determine the maximum tolerated dose of osimertinib and bevacizumab. In the phase 2 portion of the study, patients were treated at the maximum tolerated dose defined in the phase 1 portion. Statistical analysis was performed from August 1 to October 1, 2019.  Interventions:   All patients received osimertinib, 80 mg daily, and bevacizumab, 15 mg/kg once every 3 weeks.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary objective of the phase 2 portion of the study was to determine the number of patients receiving the combination of osimertinib and bevacizumab who were progression free at 12 months. Secondary end points included overall response rate, median PFS, overall survival, and definition of the toxic effects of the combination treatment.  Results:   Among the 49 patients in the study (34 women; median age, 60 years [range, 36-83 years]), PFS at 12 months was 76% (95% CI, 65%-90%). The overall response rate was 80% (95% CI, 67%-91%), and median PFS was 19 months (95% CI, 15-24 months). Of the 6 patients with measurable central nervous system disease, all had a partial or complete central nervous system response. Persistent detection of EGFR-mutant circulating tumor (ct)DNA at 6 weeks was associated with shorter median PFS (clearance at 6 weeks, 16.2 months [95% CI, 13 months to not reached]; and no clearance at 6 weeks, 9.8 months [95% CI, 4 months to not reached]; P = .04) and median overall survival (clearance at 6 weeks, not reached; and no clearance at 6 weeks, 10.1 months [95% CI, 6 months to not reached]; P = .002). Identified mechanisms of resistance included squamous cell transformation (n = 2) pleomorphic transformation (n = 1), and acquired EGFR L718Q (n = 1) and C797S (n = 1) mutations.  Conclusions and relevance:   The combination of osimertinib and bevacizumab met the study's prespecified effectiveness end point. Persistent EGFR-mutant circulating tumor DNA at 6 weeks was associated with early progression and shorter survival.

These AR-independent tumors may also transdifferentiate to express neuroendocrine lineage markers and are termed neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). Recent evidence suggests kinase signaling may be an important driver of NEPC. To identify targetable kinases in NEPC, we performed global phosphoproteomics comparing several AR-independent to AR-dependent prostate cancer cell lines and identified multiple altered signaling pathways, including enrichment of RET kinase activity in the AR-independent cell lines. Clinical NEPC patient samples and NEPC patient-derived xenografts displayed upregulated RET transcript and RET pathway activity. Genetic knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition of RET kinase in multiple mouse and human models of NEPC dramatically reduced tumor growth and decreased cell viability. Our results suggest that targeting RET in NEPC tumors with high RET expression could be an effective treatment option. Currently, there are limited treatment options for patients with aggressive neuroendocrine prostate cancer and none are curative.

However, no large reports have published cancer and quality outcomes.  Objective:   To report perioperative, functional and oncologic outcomes of sRARP in patients with localised PCa recurrence.  Design, setting, and participants:   We retrospectively evaluated 106 patients with local recurrence eligible for sRARP.  Surgical procedure:   Surgery was performed using the DaVinci Si system similar to the standard approach but with adaptation to the primary treatment.  Measurements:   Peri-operative outcomes included 90-day complication rate. Functional outcomes included rates of incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Oncological outcomes included tumour staging, margin rate and recurrence.  Results and limitations:   Primary treatment was High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) in 59 (56%) patients, 27 (25%) radiotherapy, 10 (9%) seed brachytherapy, 8 (8%) solitary androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), one (1%) cryotherapy and one (1%) electroporation / Nanoknife. Median follow-up was 2.1 years. 90-day complication rate was 8%. At two years or more, 50% were fully continent and 33% were socially continent. Continence rates tended to be better after focal compared to whole-gland treatments. Erectile dysfunction was present in 95%. Positive surgical margin rate was 39%. Biochemical recurrence occurred in 13% and local or metastatic recurrence in 11%.  Conclusions:   sRARP is technically more challenging but is a feasible option in high-volume centres for treatment of recurrent PCa. Patients should be counselled that functional outcomes are inferior to primary RARP. Adjustment of surgical technique according to the primary treatment is key for good surgical outcomes.  Patient summary:   We report our experience with sRARP for the management of localised PCa recurrence after primary treatment. This represents a feasible approach with acceptable peri-operative complications and cancer outcomes. Functional outcomes are inferior to RARP in the primary setting.""","""['R De Groote', 'A Nathan', 'E De Bleser', 'N Pavan', 'A Sridhar', 'J Kelly', 'P Sooriakumaran', 'T Briggs', 'S Nathan']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Peri-operative, functional and early oncologic outcomes of salvage robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy after high-intensity focused ultrasound partial ablation.', 'Salvage robot-assisted radical prostatectomy following focal ablation with irreversible electroporation: feasibility, oncological and functional outcomes.', 'Salvage Versus Primary Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: A Propensity-matched Comparative Effectiveness Study from a High-volume Tertiary Centre.', 'Current status of salvage robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy for radiorecurrent prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes between standard laparoscopic and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systemic review and meta-analysis.', 'Salvage Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy (sRARP) for Radiation-Recurrent Prostate Cancer: a Single-Center Experience.', 'Introduction of salvage prostatectomy in Denmark: the initial experience.', 'Evolution of Salvage Radical Prostatectomy from Open to Robotic and Further to Retzius Sparing Surgery.', 'Immediate post-operative PDE5i therapy improves early erectile function outcomes after robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).']"""

We sought to explore the transcriptomic heterogeneity of GG 5 tumors by querying transcriptomic data from the tumors of 2138 patients with GG 5 disease who underwent prostatectomy. Four distinct consensus clusters were identified with respect to differential transcriptional activation of hallmark pathways, with distinct molecular subtyping profiles and different average genomic risks (AGRs). One cluster, accounting for 325 tumors (15.2% of the population), was enriched for genes related to the cell cycle/proliferation, metabolic pathways, androgen response pathways, and DNA repair, and had a higher AGR than the other clusters (p < 0.001). This clustering, with an identification of a high genomic risk cluster, was subsequently validated in a separate cohort of 1921 patients as well as a third cohort of 201 patients. The latter cohort had outcomes available, and it was found that patients in the high genomic risk cluster had significantly worse distant metastasis-free survival than the other clusters. Tumors in this high genomic risk cluster of GG 5 disease may be particularly likely to benefit from treatment intensification.

This population-based study investigates the incidence of seven common types of cancer among people with a hospital diagnosis of schizophrenia and accounting for the effects of age, sex and calendar time.  Methods:   This population-based study used 1990-2013 data from three nationwide Swedish registries to calculate the incidence (in total, by age group and by sex) of any cancer and of lung, oesophageal, pancreatic, stomach, colon, (in men) prostate and (in women) breast cancer in 111 306 people with a hospital diagnosis of schizophrenia. The incidence in people with diagnosed schizophrenia was compared with the incidence in the general population. Risk estimates accounted for the effects of calendar time.  Results:   In 1 424 829 person-years of follow-up, schizophrenia did not confer an overall higher cancer risk (IRR 1.02, 95% CI 0.91-1.13) but was associated with a higher risk for female breast (IRR 1.19, 95% CI 1.12-1.26), lung (IRR 1.42, 95% CI 1.28-1.58), oesophageal (IRR 1.25, 95% CI 1.07-1.46) and pancreatic (IRR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01-1.21) and a lower risk of prostate (IRR 0.66, 95% CI 0.55-0.79) cancer. Some age- and sex-specific differences in risk were observed.  Conclusions:   People with schizophrenia do not have a higher overall incidence of cancer than people in the general population.

We investigated radical treatment rates according to CPG in men diagnosed with non-metastatic prostate cancer in England between 2014 and 2017.  Methods:   Patients diagnosed with non-metastatic prostate cancer were identified from the National Prostate Cancer Audit database. Men were risk stratified according to the CPG classification. Risk ratios (RR) were estimated for undergoing radical treatment according to CPG and for receiving radiotherapy for those treated radically. Funnel plots were used to display variation in radical treatment rates across hospitals.  Results:   A total of 61,999 men were included with 10,963 (17.7%) in CPG1 (lowest risk group), 13,588 (21.9%) in CPG2, 9452 (15.2%) in CPG3, 12,831 (20.7%) in CPG4, and 15,165 (24.5%) in CPG5 (highest risk group). The proportion of men receiving radical treatment increased from 11.3% in CPG1 to 78.8% in CGP4, and 73.3% in CPG5. Men in CPG3 were more likely to receive radical treatment than men in CPG2 (66.3% versus 48.4%; adjusted RR 1.44; 95% CI 1.36-1.53; P < 0.001). Radically treated men in CPG3 were also more likely to receive radiotherapy than men in CPG2 (59.2% versus 43.9%; adjusted RR, 1.18; 95% CI 1.10-1.26). Although radical treatment rates were similar in CPG4 and CPG5 (78.8% versus 73.3%; adjusted RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.98-1.04), more men in CPG5 had radiotherapy than men in CPG4 (79.9% versus 59.1%, adjusted RR 1.26; 95% CI 1.12-1.40).  Conclusions:   The CPG classification distributes men in five risk groups that are about equal in size.

Calculation of the TIIC subset proportions in 52 paired prostate cancer and paracancerous samples showed that their proportions were similar in intergroup and varied in intragroup. Compared with the paracancerous samples, the proportion of M0 macrophages was significantly increased in prostate cancer samples. Cox regression analysis using the TIIC subpopulations as continuous variables revealed that high plasma cell proportion was associated with poor 3-year Disease-Free Survival (DFS) in prostate cancer (hazard ratios = 1.8e-76, p = 0.001). Moreover, three immune clusters, which presented distinct prognosis, were identified using hierarchical clustering analysis based on the proportions of TIIC subpopulations. Among them, cluster 1 had superior 3-year DFS, while cluster 3 showed inferior 3-year DFS (p = 0.025).

Experimental design:   An androgen receptor (AR) competitive binding assay was performed, followed by evaluation of GT0918 on AR protein expression. The efficacy of GT0918 was investigated in a castration-resistant xenograft model. A phase I dose-escalation study of GT0918 in CRPC was also carried out to evaluate its safety, PK and antitumour efficacy.  Results:   GT0918 was demonstrated to inhibit the binding of androgen to AR more potently than MDV3100, and to effectively reduce the AR protein level. GT0918 inhibited the transcriptional activity of wild-type AR and AR with clinically relevant ligand-binding domain mutations. Furthermore, GT0918 significantly inhibited the growth of prostate cancer. A total of 16 patients was treated with GT0918 at five dose levels. Among these 16 patients, 10 and 2 patients, respectively, completed a three-cycle and six-cycle treatment, in which MTD was not reached. All the treatment-related adverse events were grade I, including hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, fatigue and anaemia. PK parameters showed that drug exposure increased with dose proportionally from 50 to 300 mg and a saturation was observed between 300 and 400 mg. PSA declines of ≥30% and ≥50% were, respectively, observed in six and two cases. All the 12 patients with metastatic soft tissue lesions confirmed stable disease.  Conclusions:   GT0918, a full AR antagonist without agonist effect, has high binding affinity to AR with AR protein down-regulation activity.

Using deep genomic profiling of 410 metastatic biopsies, we determine the relationships between combined TP53 and RB1 loss and PC phenotypes. Notably, 40% of TP53/RB1-deficient tumors are classified as AR-active adenocarcinomas, indicating that NE differentiation is not an obligate consequence of TP53/RB1 inactivation. A gene expression signature reflecting TP53/RB1 loss is associated with diminished responses to AR antagonists and reduced survival.

The identification of new therapeutics to selectively target prostate cancer cells is therefore vital. Recently, the rotenoids rotenone (1) and deguelin (2) were reported to selectively kill prostate cancer cells, and the inhibition of mitochondrial complex I was established as essential to their mechanism of action. However, these hydrophobic rotenoids readily cross the blood-brain barrier and induce symptoms characteristic of Parkinson's disease in animals. Since hydroxylated derivatives of 1 and 2 are more hydrophilic and less likely to readily cross the blood-brain barrier, 29 natural and unnatural hydroxylated derivatives of 1 and 2 were synthesized for evaluation. The inhibitory potency (IC50) of each derivative against complex I was measured, and its hydrophobicity (Slog10P) predicted. Amorphigenin (3), dalpanol (4), dihydroamorphigenin (5), and amorphigenol (6) were selected and evaluated in cell-based assays using C4-2 and C4-2B prostate cancer cells alongside control PNT2 prostate cells. These rotenoids inhibit complex I in cells, decrease oxygen consumption, and selectively inhibit the proliferation of prostate cancer cells, leaving control cells unaffected. The greatest selectivity and antiproliferative effects were observed with 3 and 5.

Activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and increased expression of histone deacetylases (HDACs) are common aberrations in prostate cancer, suggesting that inhibition of such targets may be a viable therapeutic strategy for this patient population. Previous reports demonstrated that combination of PI3K inhibitors (PI3KIs) with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) resulted in synergistic antitumour activities against preclinical models of prostate cancer. In this study, we demonstrate that the novel dual PI3K and HDAC inhibitor CUDC-907 has promising antitumour activity against prostate cancer cell lines in vitro and castration-resistant LuCaP 35CR patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse model in vivo. CUDC-907-induced apoptosis was partially dependent on Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, Bim and c-Myc. Further, down-regulation of Wee1, CHK1, RRM1 and RRM2 contributed to CUDC-907-induced DNA damage and apoptosis.

The mechanism is largely unknown. The transactivation leads to protection from apoptosis and nuclear translocation of the IGF-1R. The aim of this study was to clarify the signaling pathway between TF and IGF-1R after FVIIa treatment with PC3 and DU145 prostate or MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells as model systems. Protein interactions, levels, and phosphorylations were assessed by proximity ligation assay or flow cytometry in intact cells and by western blot on cell lysates. The transactivation of the IGF-1R was found dependent on TF/FVIIa-induced activation of β1-integrins. A series of experiments led to the conclusion that the caveolae protein caveolin-1 prevented IGF-1R activation in resting cells via its scaffolding domain. TF/FVIIa/β1-integrins terminated this inhibition by activation of Src family kinases and subsequent phosphorylation of caveolin-1 on tyrosine 14. This phosphorylation was not seen after treatment with PAR1 or PAR2 agonists. Consequently, the protective effect of FVIIa against apoptosis induced by the death receptor agonist TRAIL and the de novo synthesis of cyclin D1 induced by nuclear IGF-1R accumulation were both significantly reduced by down-regulation of β1-integrins or overexpression of the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain. In conclusion, we present a plausible mechanism for the interplay between TF and IGF-1R involving FVIIa, β1-integrins, Src family proteins, and caveolin-1.

The aim of this survey was to reveal preferences of men concerning prostate cancer screening and to test the effect of an informative video on these preferences.  Methods:   A stated preferences questionnaire was sent by e-mail to men aged 50-75 with no history of prostate cancer. Half of them were randomly assigned to view an informative video. A discrete choice model was established to reveal men's preferences for six prostate cancer screening characteristics: mortality by prostate cancer, number of false positive and false negative results, number of overdiagnosis, out-of-pocket costs and recommended frequency.  Results:   A population-based sample composed by 1024 men filled in the entire questionnaire. Each attribute gave the expected sign except for overdiagnosis. The video seemed to increase the intention to abstain from prostate cancer screening.  Conclusions:   The participants attached greater importance to a decrease in the number of false negatives and a reduction in prostate cancer mortality than to other risks such as the number of false positives and overdiagnosis. Further research is needed to help men make an informed choice regarding screening.""","""['M Charvin', 'G Launoy', 'C Berchi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Health Serv Res""","""[""Men's preferences and trade-offs for prostate cancer screening: a discrete choice experiment."", 'Values and preferences of men for undergoing prostate-specific antigen screening for prostate cancer: a systematic review.', ""Deliberative democracy and cancer screening consent: a randomised control trial of the effect of a community jury on men's knowledge about and intentions to participate in PSA screening."", 'Improving Health Screening Uptake in Men: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Decision making and prostate cancer screening.', 'Methodology to derive preference for health screening programmes using discrete choice experiments: a scoping review.', ""General practitioners' reflections on using PSA for diagnosis of prostate cancer.

Cancer patients are increasingly seeking integrative care clinics to promote their health and well-being during and after treatment. Aim: To examine relationships between physical activity (PA) and quality of life (QoL) in a sample of cancer patients enrolling in integrative care in a supportive care clinic. Also, to explore circulating inflammatory biomarkers and heart rate variability (HRV) in relationship to PA and QoL. Methods: A cross-sectional design of adult patients who sought care in the InspireHealth clinic, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Patients with complete PA data (n = 118) answered psychosocial questionnaires, provided blood samples, and received HRV recordings before enrollment. Patients were stratified into ""less"" versus ""more"" active groups according to PA guidelines (150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous PA or an equivalent combination). Results: Breast (33.1%) and prostate (10.2%) cancers were the most prevalent primary diagnoses. Patients engaging in more PA reported better physical (U = 1265.5, P = .013), functional (U = 1306.5, P = .024), and general QoL (U = 1341, P = .039), less fatigue (U = 1268, P = .014), fewer physical cancer-related symptoms (U = 2.338, P = .021), and less general distress (U = 2.061, P = .021). Between PA groups, type of primary cancer diagnosis differed (χ2 = 41.79, P = .014), while stages of cancer did not (χ2 = 3.95, P = .412). Fewer patients reported depressed mood within the more active group (χ2 = 6.131, P = .047). More active patients were also less likely to have ever used tobacco (χ2 = 7.41, P = .025) and used fewer nutritional supplements (χ2 = 39.74, P ≤ .001). An inflammatory biomarker index was negatively correlated with vigorous PA (rs = -0.215, P = .022). Multivariable linear regression (R2 = 0.71) revealed that age (β = 0.22; P = .001), fatigue (β = -0.43; P ≤ .001), anxiety (β = -0.14; P = .048), and social support (β = 0.38; P = .001) were significant correlates of QoL.""","""['Maíra Tristão Parra', 'Naghmeh Esmeaeli', 'Jordan Kohn', 'Brook L Henry', 'Stephen Klagholz', 'Shamini Jain', 'Christopher Pruitt', 'Daniel Vicario', 'Wayne Jonas', 'Paul J Mills']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Integr Cancer Ther""","""['The impact of physical activity on fatigue and quality of life during and after adjuvant treatment for breast cancer.', 'Fatigue, barriers to physical activity and predictors for motivation to exercise in advanced Cancer patients.', 'Exploring Associations of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activity with Quality of Life in Young Adult Cancer Survivors.', 'Yoga for improving health-related quality of life, mental health and cancer-related symptoms in women diagnosed with breast cancer.', 'Dance/movement therapy for improving psychological and physical outcomes in cancer patients.', 'Effect of a 16-Session Qigong Program in Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Survivors: A Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'The Positive Effects of Cancer Survivor Support Service on Distress in South Korea: A Nationwide Prospective Study.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively identified 297 patients with suspected prostate cancer who underwent MRI based target prostate biopsy (FUSION or ""in-bore"" approaches) between January 2016 and January 2018 in a single tertiary center.  Results:   Lesion site (peripheral vs. central) and localization (anterior vs. posterior) were equally comparable among two groups, but maximum diameter of multiparametric-MRI Index lesion was slightly superior in the in-bore MRI-GB group (14 vs. 12 mm, P=0.002). Mean random biopsy cores taken were 11.2±2.1, with 1.3±2 positive cores in FUSION-GB group. Mean number of targeted biopsy cores taken was significantly superior in the FUSION-GB group as compared to the in-bore MRI-GB group (2.6±0.7 vs.1.7±1, P<0.001), whereas mean number of positive targeted biopsy cores was comparable between two groups (1±1.3 vs.1±0.9, P=0.1). 70 (45.5%) and 75 (52.8%) patients had positive targeted bioptic cores at pathologic examination among FUSION-GB and in-bore MRI-GB groups, respectively (P=0.2). Bioptical ISUP grade was also comparable among two groups (P=0.2) in multivariate analysis PI-RADS Score (OR=3.04 and OR=8.32 for PI-RADS 4 and 5, respectively) and PSA density (OR=2.69) were identified as independent predictors of positive targeted cores at histological examination (P<0.001 and P=0.01, respectively).  Conclusions:   In-bore MRI-GB approaches represent a promising technique that may offer some advantages compared to standard systematic FUSION-GB despite higher costs of in bore-procedure. Our experience, although not showing a clear advantage between the FUSION technique and the ""in-bore"" technique, resulted safe and feasible and represents a viable procedure for the diagnosis and characterization of prostate especially in a subgroup of patient with clinically significant disease. Further investigations are needed in order to identify the best approach for MRI-GB.""","""[""Daniele D'Agostino"", 'Carlo Casablanca', 'Federico Mineo Bianchi', 'Paolo Corsi', 'Daniele Romagnoli', 'Marco Giampaoli', 'Cristian Fiori', 'Riccardo Schiavina', 'Eugenio Brunocilla', 'Walter Artibani', 'Angelo Porreca']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Minerva Urol Nephrol""","""['Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-targeted prostate biopsy: present and future of the prostate cancer diagnostic pathway.', 'Prospective randomized trial comparing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided in-bore biopsy to MRI-ultrasound fusion and transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy in patients with prior negative biopsies.', 'Comparison between ""In-bore"" MRI guided prostate biopsy and standard ultrasound guided biopsy in the patient with suspicious prostate cancer: Preliminary results.', 'Analysis of histological findings obtained combining US/mp-MRI fusion-guided biopsies with systematic US biopsies: mp-MRI role in prostate cancer detection and false negative.', 'Comparing Three Different Techniques for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Prostate Biopsies: A Systematic Review of In-bore versus Magnetic Resonance Imaging-transrectal Ultrasound fusion versus Cognitive Registration.
