Collagen is very important in aging. The molecular structure and biochemical properties of collagen changes during aging. The discoidin domain receptor (DDR1) is regulated in part by collagen. Elucidating the links between TP53 and DDR1 in chemosensitivity and aging could improve therapies against cancer and aging.  Results:   Restoration of WT-TP53 activity resulted in increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs and elevated expression of key components of the Raf/MEK/ERK, PI3K/Akt and DDR1 pathways. DDR1 could modulate the levels of Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways as well as sensitize the cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. In contrast, suppression of WT TP53 with a dominant negative (DN) TP53 gene, suppressed DDR1 protein levels and increased their chemoresistance.  Conclusion:   Restoration of WT TP53 activity or increased expression of the anti-aging DDR1 collagen receptor can result in enhanced sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. Our innovative studies indicate the important links between WT TP53 and DDR1 which can modulate Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling as well as chemosensitivity and aging.

Importantly, OHCs offer insight into conversations about the lived experiences of people with particular health conditions. Little is known about the aspects of OHCs that are important to maintain safe and productive conversations that support health.  Objective:   This study aimed to assess the provision of social support and the role of active moderation in OHCs developed in accordance with and managed by an adaptive engagement model. This study also aimed to identify key elements of the model that are central to the development, maintenance, and adaptation of OHCs for people with chronic health conditions.  Methods:   This study used combined content analysis, a mixed methods approach, to analyze sampled Facebook post comments from 6 OHCs to understand how key aspects of the adaptive engagement model facilitate different types of social support. OHCs included in this study are for people living with multiple sclerosis, migraine, irritable bowel syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, lung cancer, and prostate cancer. An exploratory approach was used in the analysis, and initial codes were grouped into thematic categories and then confirmed through thematic network analysis using the Dedoose qualitative analysis software tool. Thematic categories were compared for similarities and differences for each of the 6 OHCs and by topic discussed.  Results:   Data on the reach and engagement of the Facebook posts and the analysis of the sample of 5881 comments demonstrate that people with chronic health conditions want to engage on the web and find value in supporting and sharing their experiences with others. Most comments made in these Facebook posts were expressions of social support for others living with the same health condition (3405/5881, 57.89%). Among the comments with an element of support, those where community members validated the knowledge or experiences of others were most frequent (1587/3405, 46.61%), followed by the expression of empathy and understanding (1089/3405, 31.98%). Even among posts with more factual content, such as insurance coverage issues, user comments still had frequent expressions of support for others (80/213, 37.5%).  Conclusions:   The analysis of this OHC adaptive engagement model in action shows that the foundational elements-social support, engagement, and moderation-can effectively be used to provide a rich and dynamic community experience for individuals with chronic health conditions. Social support is demonstrated in a variety of ways, including sharing information or validating information shared by others, expressions of empathy, and sharing encouraging statements with others.""","""['Brian M Green#', 'Katelyn Tente Van Horn#', 'Ketki Gupte#', 'Megan Evans#', 'Sara Hayes#', 'Amrita Bhowmick#']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Med Internet Res""","""[""Superusers' Engagement in Asthma Online Communities: Asynchronous Web-Based Interview Study."", 'Lessons Learned for Online Health Community Moderator Roles: A Mixed-Methods Study of Moderators Resigning From WebMD Communities.', 'Promoting and supporting self-management for adults living in the community with physical chronic illness: A systematic review of the effectiveness and meaningfulness of the patient-practitioner encounter.', 'Long-Term Condition Self-Management Support in Online Communities: A Meta-Synthesis of Qualitative Papers.', 'From Help-Seekers to Influential Users: A Systematic Review of Participation Styles in Online Health Communities.', 'Methods for Analyzing the Contents of Social Media for Health Care: Scoping Review.', 'A Web-Based Decision Aid for Caregivers of Persons With Dementia With Firearm Access (Safe at Home Study): Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.', 'A randomized controlled trial evaluating the effects of social networking on chronic disease management in rheumatoid arthritis.', 'Come for Information, Stay for Support: Harnessing the Power of Online Health Communities for Social Connectedness during the COVID-19 Pandemic.', 'Digital Technology in Clinical Trials for Multiple Sclerosis: Systematic Review.']"""

HeLa and PC3 cell lines were treated with flavonoids at 10, 50 and 100 μg/mL concentrations over a 48 hour period. Stable anti-proliferative efficacy plots were obtained for tested flavonoids. From the flavonoids, HF3 and HF4 showed the strongest anti-proliferative effect against PC3 and HeLa cell line. HF1 and HF2 exhibited the strongest binding capacity to the HSA corresponding to Kb values of 3.81 x 104 M-1 and 6.00 x 104 M-1, respectively.

Materials and methods:   We performed a unicenter retrospective cohort study, on patients evaluated in our multidisciplinary oncosexology consultation, between January 2015 and January 2018, submitted to RP or ARR (males) and presenting sexual dysfunction. We evaluate the patient and oncologic characteristics, the type of sexual dysfunction, marital status, assessed the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) on the first and last consultation and the therapeutic approach. A statistical analysis was performed.  Results:   A total of 55 patients were included, 60% (33) performed ARR and 40% (22) RP. Regarding the sexual dysfunction after surgery, erectile dysfunction (ED) was found in the majority of patients (>95%). On the initial IIEF-5 scoring, ARR and RP patients had, most frequently, severe or moderate ED (score 5-11), 78.8% and 59.1% respectively. When reassessed the IIEF-5 scoring of each patient during follow-up, there was an improvement in 69.7% of ARR patients and 72.7% of RP patients (p=0.81). Regarding the therapeutic approach, 84.8% of ARR patients used phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5I) exclusively, 3% used Alprostadil injection, while RP patients used 63.6% and 31.8%, respectively (p<0.05).

The first patient is a previously healthy young woman who presented with symptoms of community-acquired pneumonia and progressed to respiratory failure. Computed tomography of the brain showed infarcts of differing ages. At autopsy, she was found to have widely metastatic cervical squamous cell carcinoma and cerebral tumor emboli with multifocal infarcts, mainly microinfarcts. The second patient is an elderly man with cognitive impairment and mild Parkinsonism who presented with symptoms of a urinary tract infection. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed atrophy and changes suggestive of chronic microvascular ischemic disease.

Previous laparo-endoscopic inguinal hernia mesh repairs can complicate subsequent radical prostatectomies due to adhesions and distortion of anatomic planes. This study aims to assess the experience of urological surgeons on the safety and feasibility of performing radical prostatectomies after laparo-endoscopic inguinal hernia mesh repair.  Methods:   For this cross-sectional study, an online 24 question survey was developed regarding the experience in performing a radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) with a prior preperitoneal inguinal hernia mesh repair. Between June 2016 and December 2017, the questionnaire was sent to all 68 urological surgeons performing radical prostatectomy in the Netherlands.  Results:   The response rate of urological surgeons was 69% (n = 47). The majority (77%) of urological surgeons perform robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomies. A previous preperitoneal inguinal hernia repair was reported by 40% of urological surgeons in 10-30% of patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Radical prostatectomy with prior preperitoneal inguinal hernia mesh repair is considered more difficult by 49%, predominantly because of (occasionally to always) experienced longer operating times (88.4%), increased blood loss (46.5%), difficult dissection of Retzius space (88.4%), nerve-sparing difficulties (32.6%), less adequate PLND (69.8%), and bladder- (16.3%) or peritoneal perforations (27.9%). Additionally, 11.6% had performed mesh explantation, 16.3% had aborted radical prostatectomies, and 35.7% experienced increased inguinal hernia recurrences after radical prostatectomies with prior preperitoneal inguinal hernia mesh repair. More experienced urological surgeons reported an increased difficulty for all outcomes.  Conclusions:   Laparo-endoscopic inguinal hernia mesh repair has a significant impact on performing a radical prostatectomy and PLND. Surgeons should postpone the inguinal hernia repair of patients in the workup for a radical prostatectomy, with the preferable option of performing the radical prostatectomy and inguinal hernia repair in the same procedure.

Methods:   We conducted a retrospective study to explore new treatment-specific biomarkers in mCRPC. A total of 211 patients with mCRPC who received either ARAT or docetaxel as first-line treatment were included. Patients were compared for radiographic progression and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to assess the association between pretreatment biomarkers and risk of events. The statistical interaction between biomarkers and clinical outcomes was also evaluated.  Results:   Of all analyzed biomarkers, multivariable Cox regression models identified MPV [≤ median (9.7 fL)] as an independent prognostic factor of radiographic progression [hazard ratio (HR), 2.35; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.15-4.80; P = 0.019] and PSA progression (HR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.01-3.95; P = 0.048) in patients treated with ARAT, whereas such associations were not observed in those treated with docetaxel. Interaction analyses showed that those initially treated with docetaxel have lower risk of radiographic progression (HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.13-0.79; P = 0.014) and PSA progression (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.23-0.98; P = 0.044) than ARAT when MPV was small.

Further analyses consisted of uni- and multivariate logistic regression models (LRM) predicting complications.  Results:   Of 268 patients undergoing HoLEP, 104 (38.8%) received AT: 25.7% were treated with platelet aggregation inhibitors (PAI), 8.2% with new oral anticoagulants (NOAC) and 4.9% with AT-combinations or coumarins bridged with low molecular weight heparins (LMWH/combination).

Methods:   Patients were included in the study if they had a PCa lesion within 3 mm of the apical capsule treated with IRE. The IRE procedure was performed in our institution by a single urologist. The QoL and functional data was collected prospectively from patients who provided consent using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC).

Results:   A total of 50 patients had apical PCa lesions treated between February 2013 and September 2018. Median follow-up was 44 months. There were no Clavien-Dindo grade 3 events or higher. No perioperative complications were recorded. No significant difference was observed in the EPIC urinary or bowel QoL domain between baseline and 12-month post-treatment. One patient (2%) required one pad per day for urinary incontinence 12-month post-treatment. There was a small but significant decline in EPIC sexual QoL (65 at baseline and 59 at 12-month post-IRE).

In this study, a phantom, containing a metal with high atomic number, was prepared for intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) treatment plans to be used in quality assurance (QA) procedures. Two sets of image files, one without metal artefact correction (ORG) and another with MAR correction (MAR+), were sent to the treatment planning system. In this study, 12 IMRT treatment plans with different fields and segment numbers were calculated. The normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) values of imaginary organs at risk (OARs), such as the rectum and bladder, were investigated, as was the difference in dose maps for ORG and MAR+ derived by calculating gamma passing rates (GPRs). The MatriXX was used for the gamma evaluation of patient-specific IMRT QA measurements. The gamma evaluation was repeated, based on the measurements using an EBT3 gafchromic film, for the plan showing the lowest GPR. The mean relative difference in NTCP values between the two sets of image files was found to be 2.5, 2.1 and 1.4 for the rectum; and 5.33, 6.80 and 9.82 for the bladder, for the investigated 5-, 7- and 9-field beam arrangements, respectively. The relative differences and the standard deviations in GPRs for the standard and metal-containing phantoms were calculated for the MAR+ and ORG sets. The maximum difference found was 7.69% ± 0.88 for the 9-field beam arrangement calculated without metal artefact correction. In the IMRT QA procedures for prostate patients with hip prostheses, the application of a metal-containing phantom that is both easy and inexpensive to prepare, is considered to be a useful method for examining any dose changes involved in introducing a hip prosthesis.

The research in this field is mainly aimed at technical applications - for instance, the development of efficient communication systems. Until present, however, the influence of KEMF on biological objects (including enzyme systems) was not considered. Herein, we have studied the influence of KEMF on the aggregation and enzymatic activity of a protein with the example of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The test HRP solution was irradiated in KEMF (the radiation power density was 10-12 W/cm2 at 2.3 GHz frequency) for 40 min. After the irradiation, the aggregation of HRP was examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) at the single-molecule level. The enzymatic activity was monitored by conventional spectrophotometry. It has been demonstrated that an increased aggregation of HRP, adsorbed on the AFM substrate surface, was observed after irradiation of the protein sample in KEMF with low (10-12 W/cm2) radiation power density; at the same time, the enzymatic activity remained unchanged. The results obtained herein can be used in the development of models describing the interaction of enzymes with electromagnetic field. The obtained data can also be of importance considering possible pathological factors that can take place upon the influence of KEMF on biological objects- for instance, changes in hemodynamics due to increased protein aggregation are possible; the functionality of protein complexes can also be affected by aggregation of their protein subunits. These effects should also be taken into account in the development of novel highly sensitive systems for human serological diagnostics of breast cancer, prostate cancer, brain cancer and other oncological pathologies, and for diagnostics of diseases in animals, and crops.""","""['Yuri D Ivanov', 'Tatyana O Pleshakova', 'Ivan D Shumov', 'Andrey F Kozlov', 'Irina A Ivanova', 'Anastasia A Valueva', 'Vadim Yu Tatur', 'Mikhail V Smelov', 'Nina D Ivanova', 'Vadim S Ziborov']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Atomic Force Microscopy Study of the Effect of an Electric Field, Applied to a Pyramidal Structure, on Enzyme Biomolecules.', 'AFM and FTIR Investigation of the Effect of Water Flow on Horseradish Peroxidase.', 'AFM study of changes in properties of horseradish peroxidase after incubation of its solution near a pyramidal structure.', 'Effect of Spherical Elements of Biosensors and Bioreactors on the Physicochemical Properties of a Peroxidase Protein.', 'Atomic force microscopy for single molecule characterisation of protein aggregation.', 'Stopped Flow of Glycerol Induces the Enhancement of Adsorption and Aggregation of HRP on Mica.', 'AFM Investigation of the Influence of Steam Flow through a Conical Coil Heat Exchanger on Enzyme Properties.', 'Atomic Force Microscopy Study of the Effect of an Electric Field, Applied to a Pyramidal Structure, on Enzyme Biomolecules.', 'The Effect of a Rotating Cone on Horseradish Peroxidase Aggregation on Mica Revealed by Atomic Force Microscopy.', 'Atomic Force Microscopy Study of the Temperature and Storage Duration Dependencies of Horseradish Peroxidase Oligomeric State.']"""

For both cytoplasmic and nuclear YAP1 staining, high levels were associated with advanced tumour stage, classical and quantitative Gleason grade, positive nodal stage, positive surgical margin, high KI67 labelling index, and early biochemical recurrence (p < 0.0001 each). The prognostic role of YAP1 staining was independent of established prognostic features in multivariate models (p < 0.001).

Patients with favorable risk received brachytherapy or dose-escalated external beam radiation (EBRT); those with unfavorable risk received EBRT plus anti-androgen therapy with/without brachytherapy. African American and Caucasian men in each subgroup were propensity score-matched and analyzed for survival. Sensitivity analysis used treatment-race and age-race interaction terms.  Results:   27,150 patients met the inclusion criteria, with a median age of 68 (range=38-90) years and median follow-up of 59.93 (range=48-142.62) months.

Profiling AR aberrations in both circulating DNA and RNA may identify key predictive and/or prognostic biomarkers in the context of contemporary systemic therapy.  Objective:   To profile AR aberrations in circulating nucleic acids and correlate with clinical outcomes.  Design, setting, and participants:   We prospectively enrolled 67 mCRPC patients commencing AR pathway inhibitors (ARPIs; n = 41) or taxane chemotherapy (n = 26). Using a first-in-class next-generation sequencing-based assay, we performed integrated cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and cell-free RNA (cfRNA) profiling from a single 10 ml blood tube.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to assess associations between clinical outcomes and the following AR aberrations: copy number variation, splice variants (AR-V7 and AR-V9) and somatic mutations.  Results and limitations:   Cell-free DNA and cfRNA were successfully sequenced in 67 (100%) and 59 (88%) patients, respectively. Thirty-six (54%) patients had one or more AR aberrations. AR gain and cumulative number of AR aberrations were independently associated with clinical/radiographic progression-free survival (PFS; hazard ratio [HR] 3.2, p = 0.01 and HR 3.0 for 0 vs ≥2, p = 0.04) and overall survival (HR 2.8, p = 0.04 and HR 2.9 for 0 vs ≥2, p = 0.03). Notably, concurrent AR gain and AR splice variant expression (AR gain/AR-V+) was associated with shorter prostate-specific antigen PFS on both ARPIs (HR 6.7, p = 0.009) and chemotherapy (HR 3.9, p = 0.04). Importantly, key findings were validated in an independent cohort of mCRPC patients (n = 40), including shorter OS in AR gain/AR-V+ disease (HR 3.3, p = 0.02). Limitations include sample size and follow-up period.  Conclusions:   We demonstrate the utility of a novel, multianalyte liquid biopsy assay capable of simultaneously detecting AR alterations in cfDNA and cfRNA. Concurrent profiling of cfDNA and cfRNA may provide vital insights into disease biology and resistance mechanisms in mCRPC.

According to the ""Warburg effect"", the metabolism of aggressive tumor cells increases significantly. The growth of cancer cells depends on glycolysis, which may be a potential target for cancer control. 6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 4 (PFKFB4) plays key roles in the proliferation and metastasis of PCa cells. However, there is very limited knowledge on the role of PFKFB4 in the conversion to castration resistance. The present study aimed to determine the changes in glucose consumption and PFKFB4 expression in LNCaP cells and androgen-independent LNCaP (LNCaP-AI) cells during the whole process of androgen-independent growth. Additionally, PFKFB4 expression in human PCa tissues was evaluated.  Methods:   We established an androgen-independent LNCaP-AI cell line derived from LNCaP cells to mimic the traits of castration resistance in vitro. LNCaP-AI and LNCaP cells were cultured in the corresponding medium containing the same amount of glucose. At the end of experiments, the medium supernatant and blank medium were collected, and absorbance was measured. LNCaP-AI and LNCaP cells were harvested to detect PFKFB4 expression by Western blotting. Prostate tissue samples including PCa tissue, carcinoma-adjacent tissue and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissue specimens were evaluated for PFKFB4 expression using immunohistochemistry.  Results:   In 18 h supernatant samples, the glucose consumption and lactate secretion of LNCaP-AI cells were higher than those of LNCaP cells. The Western blot results indicated that PFKFB4 expression was increased in LNCaP-AI cells compared with LNCaP cells. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the expression of PFKFB4 in PCa tissue specimens was higher than that in BPH and adjacent tissue specimens. However, the differences in PCa tissue before and after ADT were not statistically significant.  Conclusion:   PFKFB4 may be associated with enhanced glycolysis during the androgen-independent growth of PCa cells in vitro. PFKFB4 may be a marker of PCa progression.

Results:   CTCs were detected in 5/65 patients (7.5%) at diagnosis, 8/62 (12.9%) following neoadjuvant androgen deprivation and 11/59 (18.6%) at the end of radiotherapy, with a median CTC count/7.5 ml of 1 (range, 1-136). Only 1 patient presented a positive CTC result 9 months after radiotherapy. Positive CTC status (at any timepoint) was not significantly associated with any clinical or pathologic factors. However, when we analyzed variations in CTC patterns following treatment, we observed a significant association between conversion of CTCs and stages T3 (P = 0.044) and N1 (P = 0.002). Detection of CTCs was not significantly associated with overall survival (P > 0.40).  Conclusions:   Our study showed a low detection rate for CTCs in patients with locally advanced high-risk prostate cancer. The finding of a de novo positive CTC count after androgen deprivation therapy is probably due to a passive mechanism associated with the destruction of the tumor. Further studies with larger samples and based on more accurate detection of CTCs are needed to determine the potential prognostic and therapeutic value of this approach in non-metastatic prostate cancer.

Additionally, within a prostate-cancer-specific cohort, MDT is able to forestall initiation of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in men with hormone-sensitive, oligometastatic prostate cancer (HSOPCa) compared to observation. While MDT appears to be safe and effective in HSOPCa, a large percentage of men will eventually have disease recurrence. Patterns of failure in HSOPCa demonstrate patients tend to have recurrence in the bone following MDT, raising the question of sub-clinically-apparent osseous disease. Radium-223 dichloride is a radiopharmaceutical with structural similarity to calcium, allowing it to be taken up by bone where it emits alpha particles, and therefore might have utility in the treatment of micrometastatic osseous disease. Therefore, the primary goal of the phase II RAVENS trial is to evaluate the efficacy of MDT + radium-223 dichloride in prolonging progression free survival in men with HSOPCa.  Methods:   Patients with HSOPCa and 3 or less metastases with at least 1 bone metastasis will be randomized 1:1 to stereotactic ablative radiation (SABR, also known as stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)) alone vs SABR + radium-223 dichloride with a minimization algorithm to balance assignment by institution, primary intervention, prior hormonal therapy, and PSA doubling time. SABR is delivered in one to five fractions and patients in the SABR + radium-223 dichloride arm will receive six infusions of radium-223 dichloride at four-week intervals. The primary end point is progression free survival. The secondary clinical endpoints include toxicity and quality of life assessments, local control at 12 months, locoregional progression, time to distant progression, time to new metastasis, and duration of response.  Discussion:   The RAVENS trial will be the first described phase II, non-blinded, randomized study to compare SABR +/- radium-223 dichloride in patients with HSOPCa and 3 or less metastases with at least one bone metastasis. The primary hypothesis is that SABR + radium-223 dichloride will increase median progression-free survival from 10 months in the SABR arm to 20 months in the SABR + radium-223 dichloride arm.

Methylated ctDNA for DOCK2/HAPLN3/FBXO30 was generally not detected in healthy controls, BPH patients, nor in patients with localized PCa despite a positive signal in 98%-100% of matched radical prostatectomy tissue samples. However, ctDNA methylation of DOCK2,HAPLN3, and/or FBXO30 was detected in 61.5% (40/65) of de novo mPCa patients and markedly increased in high- compared to low-volume mPCa (89.3% (25/28) vs. 32.1% (10/31), p < 0.001). Moreover, detection of methylated ctDNA was associated with significantly shorter time to progression to metastatic castration resistant PCa, independent of tumor-volume.

The cross-coupling reaction of 2,4-dibromo-9,10-anthraquinone with arylboronic acids provide a convenient approach to 2,4-bis arylated 1-hydroxyanthraquinones with a variety of aryl substituent in the 2 and 4 position. The cytotoxicity of new anthraquinone derivatives was evaluated using the conventional MTT assays. The data revealed that six of the aryl substituted compounds among the entire series 3, 15, 16, 25, 27, 28 were comparable potent with the commercially available reference drug doxorubicin on the human glioblastoma cells SNB-19, prostate cancer DU-145 or breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and were relatively safe towards human telomerase (h-TERT)immortalized lung fibroblasts cells. The results suggested that the in vitro antitumor activity of synthesized 2-aryl, 4-aryl- and 2,4-diaryl substituted 1-hydroxyanthraquinones depends on the nature of the substituent within the cyclic backbone. Docking interaction of 2-, 4-substituted and 2,4-disubstituted 1-hydroxyanthraquinones indicates intercalative mode of binding of compounds with DNA topoisomerase.

Evaluation of BRCA1/2 variants (n = 1040) taken from four HBOC studies showed strong concordance within the pathogenic (98.1%) subset. Comparison of MH BRCA's ACMG classification to ClinVar submitter content from ENIGMA, the international consortium of investigators on the clinical significance of BRCA1/2 variants, the ARUP laboratories, a clinical testing lab of the University of UTAH, and the German Cancer Consortium showed 99.98% concordance (4975 out of 4976 variants) in the pathogenic subset.

Ibu-PSMA-02 was prepared using solid-phase synthesis techniques and labeled with lutetium-177. [177Lu]Lu-Ibu-PSMA-02 was evaluated in vitro with regard to its plasma protein-binding properties, PSMA affinity and uptake into PSMA-expressing PC-3 PIP tumor cells. The tissue distribution profile of [177Lu]Lu-Ibu-PSMA-02 was assessed in tumor-bearing mice and dose estimations were performed. The in vitro characteristics of [177Lu]Lu-Ibu-PSMA-02 were similar to those previously obtained for [177Lu]Lu-Ibu-PSMA-01 with respect to plasma protein-binding, PSMA affinity and tumor cell uptake. The in vivo studies revealed, however, an unprecedentedly high uptake of [177Lu]Lu-Ibu-PSMA-02 in PC-3 PIP tumors, resulting in an increased absorbed tumor dose of 7.7 Gy/MBq as compared to 5.1 Gy/MBq calculated for [177Lu]Lu-Ibu-PSMA-01.

Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify the relationships between gene modules and clinical features, as well as the candidate genes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) analyses were developed to investigate the potential functions of related hub genes. Importantly, basic experiments were performed to verify the relationship between hub genes and the phenotype previously identified. Lastly, copy number variation (CNV) analysis was conducted to explore the genetical alteration. WGCNA identified that black module was the most relevant module which was tightly related to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) phenotype. KEGG and GO analysis results revealed genes in black module were mainly related to RNA splicing. Additionally, 9 genes were chosen as hub genes and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 (HNRNPA2B1), golgin A8 family member B (GOLGA8B) and mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 interacting protein 3 (MAPK8IP3) were identified to be associated with PCa progression and prognosis.

Growing interest in the latest approved cabazitaxel taxane drug has markedly increased due to the survival benefits conferred when used at an earlier stage of the disease, its promising new therapeutic combination and formulation, and its differential toxicity. Still cabazitaxel's mechanisms of resistance are poorly characterized. The goal of this study was thus to generate a new model of acquired resistance against cabazitaxel in order to unravel cabazitaxel's resistance mechanisms.  Methods:   Du145 cells were cultured with increasing concentrations of cabazitaxel, docetaxel/ taxane control or placebo/age-matched control. Once resistance was reached, Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Translation (EMT) was tested by cell morphology, cell migration, and E/M markers expression profile. Cell transcriptomics were determined by RNA sequencing; related pathways were identified using IPA, PANTHER or KEGG software. The Wnt pathway was analyzed by western blotting, pharmacological and knock-down studies.  Results:   While age-matched Du145 cells were sensitive to both taxane drugs, docetaxel-resistant cells were only resistant to docetaxel and cabazitaxel-resistant cells showed a partial cross-resistance to both drugs concomitant to EMT. Using RNA-sequencing, the Wnt non-canonical pathway was identified as exclusively activated in cabazitaxel resistant cells while the Wnt canonical pathway was restricted to docetaxel-resistant cells. Cabazitaxel-resistant cells showed a minimal crossover in the Wnt-pathway-related genes linked to docetaxel resistance validating our unique model of acquired resistance to cabazitaxel. Pharmacological and western blot studies confirmed these findings and suggest the implication of the Tyrosine kinase Ror2 receptor in cabazitaxel resistant cells. Variation in Ror2 expression level altered the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to both drugs identifying a possible new target for taxane resistance.  Conclusion:   Our study represents the first demonstration that while Wnt pathway seems to play an important role in taxanes resistance, Wnt effectors responsible for taxane specificity remain un-identified prompting the need for more studies.""","""['Souad R Sennoune', 'Thomas Nelius', 'Courtney Jarvis', 'Kevin Pruitt', 'Kameswara Rao Kottapalli', 'Stéphanie Filleur']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['DNA-PKc inhibition overcomes taxane resistance by promoting taxane-induced DNA damage in prostate cancer cells.', 'Cabazitaxel is more active than first-generation taxanes in ABCB1(+) cell lines due to its reduced affinity for P-glycoprotein.', 'Preclinical profile of cabazitaxel.', 'Cabazitaxel regimens inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells and enhances the anti-tumor properties of PEDF with various efficacy and toxicity.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'ROR2 increases the chemoresistance of melanoma by regulating p53 and Bcl2-family proteins via ERK hyperactivation.']"""

However, long-term randomized data that test this paradigm are lacking.  Methods:   We enrolled patients with a controlled primary malignancy and 1-5 metastatic lesions, with all metastases amenable to stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). We stratified by the number of metastases (1-3 v 4-5) and randomized in a 1:2 ratio between palliative standard-of-care (SOC) treatments (arm 1) and SOC plus SABR (arm 2). We used a randomized phase II screening design with a primary end point of overall survival (OS), using an α of .20 (wherein P < .20 indicates a positive trial). Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS), toxicity, and quality of life (QOL). Herein, we present long-term outcomes from the trial.  Results:   Between 2012 and 2016, 99 patients were randomly assigned at 10 centers internationally. The most common primary tumor types were breast (n = 18), lung (n = 18), colorectal (n = 18), and prostate (n = 16). Median follow-up was 51 months. The 5-year OS rate was 17.7% in arm 1 (95% CI, 6% to 34%) versus 42.3% in arm 2 (95% CI, 28% to 56%; stratified log-rank P = .006).

Radiation source path reconstruction is a critical procedure in HDR treatment planning. Manually identifying the source path is labor intensive and time inefficient. In recent years, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a valuable imaging modality for image-guided HDR prostate brachytherapy due to its superb soft-tissue contrast for target delineation and normal tissue contouring. The purpose of this study is to investigate a deep-learning-based method to automatically reconstruct multiple catheters in MRI for prostate cancer HDR brachytherapy treatment planning.  Methods:   Attention gated U-Net incorporated with total variation (TV) regularization model was developed for multi-catheter segmentation in MRI. The attention gates were used to improve the accuracy of identifying small catheter points, while TV regularization was adopted to encode the natural spatial continuity of catheters into the model. The model was trained using the binary catheter annotation images offered by experienced physicists as ground truth paired with original MRI images. After the network was trained, MR images of a new prostate cancer patient receiving HDR brachytherapy were fed into the model to predict the locations and shapes of all the catheters. Quantitative assessments of our proposed method were based on catheter shaft and tip errors compared to the ground truth.  Results:   Our method detected 299 catheters from 20 patients receiving HDR prostate brachytherapy with a catheter tip error of 0.37 ± 1.68 mm and a catheter shaft error of 0.93 ± 0.50 mm. For detection of catheter tips, our method resulted in 87% of the catheter tips within an error of less than ± 2.0 mm, and more than 71% of the tips can be localized within an absolute error of no >1.0 mm. For catheter shaft localization, 97% of catheters were detected with an error of <2.0 mm, while 63% were within 1.0 mm.  Conclusions:   In this study, we proposed a novel multi-catheter detection method to precisely localize the tips and shafts of catheters in three-dimensional MRI images of HDR prostate brachytherapy.

Methods:   At our hospital, 121 bone scintigraphy scans using 99mTc-HMDP were performed and analyzed to examine bone metastases from prostate cancer, revealing the abnormal accumulation of radioisotope (RI) at bone metastasis sites. Blood tests for serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were performed concurrently.

Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples for patients with mRCC were evaluated with Dako 28-8 and Ventana SP142 PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assays. For patients with mUC, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples were evaluated with Dako 22C3 and Ventana SP263 PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assays.  Results:   The majority (29/32; 91%) of mRCC cases were concordant between assays. The majority (17/18; 94%) of mUC cases were also concordant between assays.  Conclusions:   There was strong concordance between PD-L1 assays chosen for comparison in both mRCC and mUC, with similar performance characteristics.

Material and method:   All patients in AS between January 2011 and October 2019 were retrospectively included in a computerized database. The group of patients who had an AS interruption was compared to the one still under AS, in order to identify potential risk factors for the interruption of the surveillance protocol.  Results:   Two hundred and two patients have been included in the AS cohort with a median follow-up of 32months. At the time of analysis, 72 patients (36%) were not under the AS protocol anymore, 118 (58%) were still under AS and 12 (6%) were lost of follow-up. Sixty-six patients (92%) had left SA due to PCa progression, 4 (5%) by personal choice and 2 (3%) switched to watchful waiting. A PSA doubling Time<3years (PSADT<3years) has been identified as the only statistically significant RF for AS interruption, both in the unvaried (P<0.001) and multivariate (OR=5.403, P<0.01) analysis. It was also the only RF of AS interruption in the early analysis in the first three years of AS, in the unvaried analysis (P=0.021) and the multivariate analysis (OR=3.612, P=0.018).

Methods:   We investigated the effects of stigmasterol on proapoptotic signals, mitochondrial function, reactive oxygen species production, and the cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium levels in human ovarian cancer cells, to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of stigmasterol on ovarian cancer cells. We also conducted migration assay to confirm whether that stigmasterol inhibits ovarian cancer cell migration.  Results:   Stigmasterol inhibited development of human ovarian cancer cells. However, it induced cell apoptosis, ROS production, and calcium overload in ES2 and OV90 cells. In addition, stigmasterol stimulated cell death by activating the ER-mitochondrial axis.

A fracture involving the fused vertebra in patients with DISH often leads to severe instability and spinal cord injury. Spinal metastasis (Mets) and DISH can coexist in elderly patients and increase their risk of pathologic vertebral fractures. However, there are few reports on concomitant spinal Mets and DISH.  Patient concerns:   A 78-year-old man who complained of gradual onset of paraparesis, sensory loss below the umbilicus, and incontinence (case 1) and a 63-year-old woman who complained of severe back pain and urinary incontinence (case 2).  Diagnosis:   Two patients were diagnosed with spinal Mets and DISH.  Interventions:   Decompression surgery was performed at the metastatic sites in case 1 whereas instrumentation surgery was performed in case 2 despite the fracture having a benign appearance with no associated neurologic symptoms.  Outcomes:   A vertebral fracture developed at the metastatic vertebra after decompression surgery in case 1. Severe instability of the surgical site in this case resulted in persistent paralysis even after subsequent revision surgery with instrumentation. In contrast, the clinical course was benign without any neurologic dysfunction at the 2-year follow-up in case 2.

The technology integrates the focusing power of ITP and the multiplex capability of paper-based lateral flow to achieve on-board separation of target exosomes from large extracellular vesicles, followed by electrokinetic enrichment of the targets, leading to an ultrasensitive platform for comprehensive exosome analysis. For a proof of concept, the technology platform was tested with human serum samples spiked with exosomes derived from healthy human serum and a prostate cancer cell line. Under an anionic ITP condition, the device showed superior performance in simultaneous detection of the cancer exosomes and normal exosomes at concentrations as low as 1.2-2.0 × 106 exosomes/mL, which is equivalent to 2.0-3.0 × 10-18 M. The observed limit of detection was more than 30-fold better than that of enhanced ELISA.

The meaningful benefit of PARP inhibitors in mCRPC carrying mutations in DNA repair genes demonstrated in a phase III trial epitomizes this transition in the treatment paradigm of mCRPC and brings new challenges related to how to sequence and integrate the targeted therapies on top of the treatments with broad activity in all mCRPC.

Methods:   199 biopsy-naïve males undergoing prostate mpMRI were prospectively scored with Likert and PI-RADS systems by four experienced radiologists. A binary cut-off (threshold score ≥3) was used to analyze histological results by three groups: negative, insignificant disease (Gleason 3 + 3; iPCa), and csPCa (Gleason ≥3 +4). Lesion-level results and prostate zonal location were also compared.  Results:   129/199 (64.8%) males underwent biopsy, 96 with Likert or PI-RADS score ≥3, and 21 with negative MRI. A further 12 patients were biopsied during follow-up (mean 507 days). Prostate cancer was diagnosed in 87/199 (43.7%) patients, 65 with (33.6%) csPCa. 30/92 (32.6%) patients with negative MRI were biopsied, with an NPV of 83.3% for cancer and 86.7% for csPCa. Likert and PI-RADS score differences were observed in 92 patients (46.2%), but only for 16 patients (8%) at threshold score ≥3. Likert scoring had higher specificity than PI-RADS (0.77 vs 0.66), higher area under the curve (0.92 vs 0.87, p = 0.002) and higher PPV (0.66 vs 0.58); NPV and sensitivity were the same. Likert had more five score results (58%) compared to PI-RADS (36%), but with similar csCPa detection (81.0 and 80.6% respectively). Likert demonstrated lower proportion of false positive in the predominately AFMS-involving lesions.  Conclusion:   Likert and PI-RADS systems both demonstrate high cancer detection rates. Likert scoring had a higher AUC with moderately higher specificity and lower positive call rate and could potentially help to reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies performed.

Purpose:   To develop an artificial intelligence (AI) solution for PI-RADS classification and compare its performance with an expert radiologist using targeted biopsy results.  Study type:   Retrospective study including data from our institution and the publicly available ProstateX dataset.  Population:   In all, 687 patients who underwent mpMRI of the prostate and had one or more detectable lesions (PI-RADS score >1) according to PI-RADSv2.  Field strength/sequence:   T2 -weighted, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI; five evenly spaced b values between b = 0-750 s/mm2 ) for apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping, high b-value DWI (b = 1500 or 2000 s/mm2 ), and dynamic contrast-enhanced T1 -weighted series were obtained at 3.0T.  Assessment:   PI-RADS lesions were segmented by a radiologist. Bounding boxes around the T2 /ADC/high-b value segmentations were stacked and saved as JPEGs. These images were used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN). The PI-RADS scores obtained by the CNN were compared with radiologist scores. The cancer detection rate was measured from a subset of patients who underwent biopsy.  Statistical tests:   Agreement between the AI and the radiologist-driven PI-RADS scores was assessed using a kappa score, and differences between categorical variables were assessed with a Wald test.  Results:   For the 1034 detection lesions, the kappa score for the AI system vs. the expert radiologist was moderate, at 0.40. However, there was no significant difference in the rates of detection of clinically significant cancer for any PI-RADS score in 86 patients undergoing targeted biopsy (P = 0.4-0.6).

This study examined prostate cancer (PCa) xenografts and patient samples to identify in vivo mechanisms of taxane action and resistance. Docetaxel drug-target engagement was assessed by confocal anti-tubulin immunofluorescence to quantify microtubule bundling in interphase cells and aberrant mitoses. Tumor biopsies from metastatic PCa patients obtained 2 to 5 days after their first dose of docetaxel or cabazitaxel were processed to assess microtubule bundling, which correlated with clinical response. Microtubule bundling was evident in PCa xenografts 2 to 3 days after docetaxel treatment but was decreased or lost with acquired resistance. Biopsies after treatment with leuprolide plus docetaxel showed extensive microtubule bundling as did biopsies obtained 2 to 3 days after initiation of docetaxel or cabazitaxel in 2 patients with castration-resistant PCa with clinical responses. In contrast, microtubule bundling in biopsies 2 to 3 days after the first dose of docetaxel was markedly lower in 4 nonresponding patients. These findings indicate that taxanes target both mitotic and interphase cells in vivo and that resistance is through mechanisms that impair drug-target engagement.

The National Cancer Registry collects data on cancer cases nationwide since 1989 and has reached high quality standards in the last decades. This is the first report on incidence trends.  Methods:   Data from the National Cancer Registry of all new cases of invasive cancer from twelve sites diagnosed in 2002-2015 was analyzed. Age-standardized rates were calculated. Trends of incidence rates were analyzed using joinpoint regression models.  Results:   For both, men and women, incidence rates trends for all cancer sites, colo-rectal and bladder cancer remained stable. Esophageal and gastric cancers descended while thyroid and kidney cancer incidence increased. In men lung cancer decreased; testicular cancer increased, and prostate cancer increased at the beginning of the period and decreased in the final years. In women, lung cancer increased, breast cancer remained stable and cervical cancer presented a significant decline from 2005 to 2010 and reached a plateau since then.  Conclusion:   Cancer incidence dynamics are complex and affected not only by Public Health policies such as tobacco control, vaccination and screening programs, but also by environmental and life style changes and the attitude of the medical community towards the application of diagnostic and therapeutic tools.

Its exact function as a negative regulator of protein kinase R establishes its connection with innate immunity. Studies have shown that nc886 silencing is closely associated with prostate cancer progression. Previous work has constructed a cell model of stable nc886 overexpression (""mimic"" or ""nc886+ "") in PC-3M-1E8 cell lines (1E8), which are highly bone-metastatic human prostate cancer cells with low expression of nc886, and cells expressing the mimic were validated to have lower invasive and metastatic abilities than cells expressing the scramble transcript in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we directly injected mimic or scramble cells into the left ventricle of C57BL/C mice, an immunocompetent animal model, to elucidate the immune mechanisms of tumor-host interactions. Interestingly, we found that tumor cells induced the inflammation of many important organs due to xenogeneic antigen rejection; this inflammation was ultimately repaired by tissue fibrosis after 28 days, except for in the spleen. The reason is that mimic cells, as heterogeneous antigens, are mostly directly recognized by macrophages or T cells in blood, and few mimic cells enter the spleen compared with scramble cells. The induction of splenic macrophage polarization to M2 macrophages by scramble cells is a critical factor in maintaining chronic splenic inflammation. In addition, we recognize that nc886 broadly decreases the expression of some human leukocyte antigen molecules and antigen transporters. This evidence reveals the interesting role of nc886 in regulating tumor cell antigens.""","""['Hui Ma', 'Miao Wang', 'Ying Zhou', 'Jia-Jie Yang', 'Li-Yong Wang', 'Rong-Hui Yang', 'Min-Jie Wen', 'Lu Kong']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Nc886 is epigenetically repressed in prostate cancer and acts as a tumor suppressor through the inhibition of cell growth.', 'nc886, a non-coding RNA and suppressor of PKR, exerts an oncogenic function in thyroid cancer.', 'A Regulatory Noncoding RNA, nc886, Suppresses Esophageal Cancer by Inhibiting the AKT Pathway and Cell Cycle Progression.', 'A Novel Type of Non-coding RNA, nc886, Implicated in Tumor Sensing and Suppression.', 'nc886, an RNA Polymerase III-Transcribed Noncoding RNA Whose Expression Is Dynamic and Regulated by Intriguing Mechanisms.', 'Downregulation of nc886 contributes to prostate cancer cell invasion and TGFβ1-induced EMT.', 'Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies and Integration Analysis of mRNA Expression Profiles Identify Candidate Genes and Pathways Associated With Ankylosing Spondylitis.', 'The nuclear and cytoplasmic activities of RNA polymerase III, and an evolving transcriptome for surveillance.']"""

Methods:   Utilizing the USA Health Information National Trends Survey, 4th Ed., a cross-sectional study from 2011 to 2014 was carried out to analyze the factors predicting prostate-specific antigen testing and discussion in men ≥55 years. Associations between each covariate and prostate-specific antigen discussion/testing were determined. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine clinically relevant predictors of prostate-specific antigen discussion/testing. Due to multiple comparisons, the Bonferroni correction was used.  Results:   A total of 2731 men included in the Health Information National Trends Survey were analyzed. Several socioeconomic parameters were found to increase the likelihood of men aged ≥55 years to undergo prostate-specific antigen testing: living with a spouse, a higher level of education (college graduate or above), a higher income (>$50 000 annually) and previous history of any cancer. In contrast, current smokers were less likely to undergo prostate-specific antigen testing. Having a prostate-specific antigen discussion with a physician was more likely for men surveyed in 2014, for men who were living with a spouse, who had a higher annual income (>$50 000 annually) and those with a history of any cancer.  Conclusions:   Significant inequalities in prostate-specific antigen testing and discussion exist among men in the USA, mainly driven by socioeconomic factors. Ideally, prostate-specific antigen testing and discussion should be based on relevant clinical factors with a shared decision-making approach for every man. Therefore, a better understanding of the socioeconomic factors influencing prostate-specific antigen testing/discussions can inform strategies to reduce existing gaps in care.""","""['Joon Yau Leong', 'Thenappan Chandrasekar', 'Alejandro Berlin', 'Zachary Klaassen', 'Christopher Jd Wallis', 'Ardalan E Ahmad', 'Jaime O Herrera-Caceres', 'Nathan Perlis', 'Neil E Fleshner', 'Hanan Goldberg']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Urol""","""['Do Men Receive Information Required for Shared Decision Making About PSA Testing?

Methods:   Histological grading and scoring had been done using the revised International Society of urologic pathology (ISUP) system and cases were classified into Grade groups. Gleason grades less than 3 were not assigned and Scores less than 6 not assigned. The Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA) levels as well as the average tumour percentage in the biopsy specimens were determined.  Results:   A hundred and forty-five (145) patients were seen. The majority of patients seen were in Grade group 5 (30.3%), followed by grade group 4 (26.2%) and then groups 1, 3 and 2 in that order. Patients' ages ranged from 47 years to 86 years, with peak age incidence in the 7th decade. PSA values ranged from 3.6 to 22,130ng/ml and tumour volumes ranged from 5% of biopsy tissue to 95%. The lowest PSA value was seen in a patient in grade group 1 but the highest PSA value was recorded in a patient in Grade group 3. The lowest and highest tumour volumes were seen in patients in grade group 4. The PSA and tumour volumes did not vary in linear fashion with Gleason grade.  Conclusion:   The results show that the majority of patients in Ibadan present with high grade prostatic carcinoma even using the new ISUP grading system but the proportion of highgrade tumours seems higher than in the previous study, likely because more diagnostic tissue has become available per case. Examining a minimum of 12 cores have definitely created an opportunity for proper grading. Peak incidence is in the 7th decade followed by the 8th decade.

The median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 280ng/ml [82.4-958]. Three hundred and thirty one patients (66.3%) had high volume bone metastasis and 57 patients (10.9%) had visceral metastasis. Clinical demographics and clinicopathological were similar across both groups. Similar oncological outcomes were observed in both groups. The proportion of PSA response (PSA <1ng/ml) was 65.6% for SO and 67.2% for MC (P = 0.212). Both therapies achieve >95% of effective androgen suppression (testosterone <50ng/dL). Time to castrate-resistance was similar (18 vs 16 months, P = 0.097), with comparative overall survival (42 vs. 38.5 months, P = 0.058) and prostate cancer mortality (80.1 vs. 75.9%, P = 0.328). Similarly, no difference was observed for the 4 AE profiles between SO and MC respectively; change in Haemoglobin (-0.75 vs. -1.0g/dL, P = 0.302), newly diagnosed Diabetes mellitus (4.6 vs. 2.9%, P = 0.281), control measured by HbA1c (0.2 vs. 0.25%, P = 0.769), coronary artery disease events (9.9 vs. 12.9%, P = 0.376) and skeletal-related fractures (9.3 vs. 7.3%, P = 0.476). After adjusting for varying governmental subsidies and inflation rates, the median cost of SO was $5275, compared to MC of $9185.80.  Conclusion:   Both SO and MC have similar oncological outcomes and AE profiles. However, SO remains a much more cost-effective form of ADT for the long-term treatment of mPCa patients.""","""['Yu Guang Tan', 'Randy Jy Poon', 'Leonard Jw Pang', 'Andre Villanueva', 'Hong Hong Huang', 'Kenneth Chen', 'Tze Kiat Ng', 'Kae Jack Tay', 'Henry Ss Ho', 'John Sp Yuen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Palliative Transurethral Resection of the Prostate in Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Study of 188 Patients.', 'Local and systemic morbidities of de novo metastatic prostate cancer in Singapore: insight from 685 consecutive patients from a large prospective Uro-oncology registry.', 'The impact of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) on the risk of cardiovascular (CV) events in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer: a population-based study.', 'Relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of methods of androgen suppression in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.', 'Serum testosterone levels after medical or surgical androgen deprivation: a comprehensive review of the literature.', 'A GATA2-CDC6 axis modulates androgen receptor blockade-induced senescence in prostate cancer.', 'Affordable and underutilized: the paradox of surgical castration.', 'Significant financial differences of chemical and surgical androgen deprivation in a contemporary cohort.', 'Interplay of Developmental Hippo-Notch Signaling Pathways with the DNA Damage Response in Prostate Cancer.', 'Ezrin expression in circulating tumor cells is a predictor of prostate cancer metastasis.']"""

We analyze the usefulness and applicability of the SelectMDx® marker in a routine clinical practice setting.  Material and methods:   Retrospective study of 48 patients evaluated by the SelectMDx® test between July 2017 and April 2019. Patients were stratified into two groups according to the risk estimated by the clinically significant CP test (CS-PC): <2% or 'very low risk', and >2%. Results were expressed based on previous prostate biopsy (PB) and multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) outcomes.  Results:   Patients with negative PB and normal/doubtful mpMRI had <2% risk in 7/9 cases. Patients without PB and normal/doubtful mpMRI had <2% risk in 12/18 cases, and 2/6 cases with a >2% risk presented CS-PC. Of the 14 patients with no previous PB or mpMRI, 9 had <2% risk, and 2 cases were diagnosed with PC from the group of patients (5) with risk >2%. The number of patients in the remaining subgroups is too small to draw any conclusions. In all cases with pathological digital rectal examination, the test showed a >2% PC risk.  Conclusion:   SelectMDx® is a promising test for detecting patients with a very low risk of CS-PC, especially in patients with suspected PC, with or without negative PB, with normal/doubtful mpMRI.

However, divergences exist regarding its employed doses in preclinical works. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether the antitumor effects of ivermectin are observable at clinically feasible drug concentrations.  Methods:   Twenty-eight malignant cell lines were treated with 5 μM ivermectin. Cell viability, clonogenicity, cell cycle, cell death and pharmacological interaction with common cytotoxic drugs were assessed, as well as the consequences of its use on stem cell-enriched populations. The antitumor in vivo effects of ivermectin were also evaluated.  Results:   The breast MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and MCF-7, and the ovarian SKOV-3, were the most sensitive cancer cell lines to ivermectin. Conversely, the prostate cancer cell line DU145 was the most resistant to its use. In the most sensitive cells, ivermectin induced cell cycle arrest at G0-G1 phase, with modulation of proteins associated with cell cycle control. Furthermore, ivermectin was synergistic with docetaxel, cyclophosphamide and tamoxifen. Ivermectin reduced both cell viability and colony formation capacity in the stem cell-enriched population as compared with the parental one. Finally, in tumor-bearing mice ivermectin successfully reduced both tumor size and weight.  Conclusion:   Our results on the antitumor effects of ivermectin support its clinical testing.""","""['Mandy Juarez', 'Alejandro Schcolnik-Cabrera', 'Guadalupe Dominguez-Gomez', 'Alma Chavez-Blanco', 'Jose Diaz-Chavez', 'Alfonso Duenas-Gonzalez']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Chemother Pharmacol""","""['Ivermectin inhibits the growth of glioma cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo.', 'Ivermectin inhibits canine mammary tumor growth by regulating cell cycle progression and WNT signaling.', 'Antitumor effects of cytoplasmic delivery of an innate adjuvant receptor ligand, poly(I:C), on human breast cancer.', 'Progress in Redirecting Antiparasitic Drugs for Cancer Treatment.', 'Double Repositioning: Veterinary Antiparasitic to Human Anticancer.', 'TTT (Tel2-Tti1-Tti2) Complex, the Co-Chaperone of PIKKs and a Potential Target for Cancer Chemotherapy.', 'Pharmacological Efficacy of Repurposing Drugs in the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'The Antineoplastic Effect of Carboplatin Is Potentiated by Combination with Pitavastatin or Metformin in a Chemoresistant High-Grade Serous Carcinoma Cell Line.', 'Ivermectin induces cell cycle arrest and caspase-dependent apoptosis in human urothelial carcinoma cells.', 'Ivermectin: A Controversial Focal Point during the COVID-19 Pandemic.']"""

Methods:   We performed a retrospective study on 179 consecutive patients receiving RP from June 2016 to October 2018. Clinical characteristics were collected. PPAT measurements including peri-prostatic fat area (PPFA) and peri-prostatic fat area to prostate area (PA) ratio (PPFA/PA) were calculated by MRI. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of PCa lymph node metastasis (LNM). The predictive performance was estimated through ROC curves.

Methods:   Between 2005 and 2016, a consecutive series of 4079 patients underwent isolated CABG at our institution. Of 103 patients (2.5%) with active malignancy, we enrolled 82 patients (mean age 71 ± 7 years) with solid organ tumours, divided into 4 subgroups: lung (9 patients-11%), gastroenteric (16 patients-20%), urinary (48 patients-58%) and other solid tumours (9 patients-11%). A deterministic record linkage between the clinical database and the National Hospital Information System allowed identification of long-term survival rates and freedom from major adverse cardiovascular events (acute myocardial infarction, repeated admissions for percutaneous coronary intervention and heart failure).  Results:   The most common forms of cancer were prostate, colon and carcinoma of the lung. Compared to patients without cancer, patients with neoplasms were significantly older and had a higher rate of comorbidities, without significant differences among the cancer subgroups. The 30-day mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with cancer compared to those without cancer (4.9% vs 1.8%). However, on logistic regression analysis, cancer was an independent risk factor for postoperative pulmonary dysfunction but not for in-hospital death. The median follow-up time was 58 ± 12 months. The overall 5-year survival rate was 60% [95% confidence interval (CI) 47-71%], with a dismal 32% (95% CI 5-65%) survival rate among patients who had lung tumours only. The 5-year freedom from major adverse cardiovascular events was 64% (95% CI 52-74%), without significant differences among subgroups, and was comparable to that of the non-cancer population. Resolution of coronary heart disease allowed safe cancer surgical resection in 80% of the population.

Here we characterise the outcomes of a cohort of patients with cancer and COVID-19 and identify potential prognostic factors for mortality and severe illness.  Methods:   In this cohort study, we collected de-identified data on patients with active or previous malignancy, aged 18 years and older, with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection from the USA, Canada, and Spain from the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) database for whom baseline data were added between March 17 and April 16, 2020. We collected data on baseline clinical conditions, medications, cancer diagnosis and treatment, and COVID-19 disease course. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality within 30 days of diagnosis of COVID-19. We assessed the association between the outcome and potential prognostic variables using logistic regression analyses, partially adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, and obesity. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04354701, and is ongoing.  Findings:   Of 1035 records entered into the CCC19 database during the study period, 928 patients met inclusion criteria for our analysis. Median age was 66 years (IQR 57-76), 279 (30%) were aged 75 years or older, and 468 (50%) patients were male. The most prevalent malignancies were breast (191 [21%]) and prostate (152 [16%]). 366 (39%) patients were on active anticancer treatment, and 396 (43%) had active (measurable) cancer. At analysis (May 7, 2020), 121 (13%) patients had died. In logistic regression analysis, independent factors associated with increased 30-day mortality, after partial adjustment, were: increased age (per 10 years; partially adjusted odds ratio 1·84, 95% CI 1·53-2·21), male sex (1·63, 1·07-2·48), smoking status (former smoker vs never smoked: 1·60, 1·03-2·47), number of comorbidities (two vs none: 4·50, 1·33-15·28), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or higher (status of 2 vs 0 or 1: 3·89, 2·11-7·18), active cancer (progressing vs remission: 5·20, 2·77-9·77), and receipt of azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine (vs treatment with neither: 2·93, 1·79-4·79; confounding by indication cannot be excluded). Compared with residence in the US-Northeast, residence in Canada (0·24, 0·07-0·84) or the US-Midwest (0·50, 0·28-0·90) were associated with decreased 30-day all-cause mortality. Race and ethnicity, obesity status, cancer type, type of anticancer therapy, and recent surgery were not associated with mortality.  Interpretation:   Among patients with cancer and COVID-19, 30-day all-cause mortality was high and associated with general risk factors and risk factors unique to patients with cancer.

The aims of this study were to see if the national target of 70% of all cancer patients being included in a CPP was met, and to identify factors associated with CPP inclusion.  Methods:   All patients registered with a colorectal, lung, breast or prostate cancer diagnosis at the Cancer Registry of Norway in the period 2015-2016 were linked with the Norwegian Patient Registry for CPP information and with Statistics Norway for sociodemographic variables. Multivariable logistic regression examined if the odds of not being included in a CPP were associated with year of diagnosis, age, sex, tumour stage, marital status, education, income, region of residence and comorbidity.  Results:   From 2015 to 2016, 30,747 patients were diagnosed with colorectal, lung, breast or prostate cancer, of whom 24,429 (79.5%) were included in a CPP. Significant increases in the probability of being included in a CPP were observed for colorectal (79.1 to 86.2%), lung (79.0 to 87.3%), breast (91.5 to 97.2%) and prostate cancer (62.2 to 76.2%) patients (p < 0.001). Increasing age was associated with an increased odds of not being included in a CPP for lung (p < 0.001) and prostate cancer (p < 0.001) patients. Colorectal cancer patients < 50 years of age had a two-fold increase (OR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.70-2.91) in the odds of not being included in a CPP. The odds of no CPP inclusion were significantly increased for low income colorectal (OR = 1.24, 95%CI: 1.00-1.54) and lung (OR = 1.52, 95%CI: 1.16-1.99) cancer patients. Region of residence was significantly associated with CPP inclusion (p < 0.001) and the probability, adjusted for case-mix ranged from 62.4% in region West among prostate cancer patients to 97.6% in region North among breast cancer patients.  Conclusions:   The national target of 70% was met within 1 year of CPP implementation in Norway.

Our protocol included a combination of MRI-TBx, DPS-TBx and modified SBx with additional biopsies from anterior lateral horns and anterior aspects of apex. MRI findings were defined as suspicious lesions (MRI-SL) and highly suspicious lesions (MRI-HL), based on PIRADS scale. In 40 patients csPCa was detected. While, MRI diagnosed csPCa in 36 patients (23%, n-36/154): 25% and 92% of biopsies targeted to the MRI- SL and MRI-HSL confirmed csPCa. Thirty-eight PDS hypervascular areas were found, while csPCa was diagnosed in 84% of these lesions, or in 28 patients (18%, n-28/154). SBx detected csPCa in 34 cores or in 21 patients (13%, n - 21/154). SBx missed cancers in the in the anterior aspect of middle gland. Combination of PDS-TBx + SBx detected csPCa in 35 (88% of csPCa) patients. Strongest predictors for the csPCa presence were MRI-HSL, PDS' lesions and biopsies from anterior aspect that included apex, mid gland and anterior lateral horns (p < 0.001 and p-0.008, respectively). The combination of PDS-TBx + SBx may miss 15% of csPCa detected by MRI. However, it can detect additional 10% of csPCa that were missed by MRI. To improve the accuracy of this combination, the anterior aspect of middle gland should be also included in the modified SBx.

Despite evidence linking CTCF to the protection of epigenetic states through barrier insulation, the impact of CTCF loss on genome-wide DNA methylation sites in human cancer remains undefined.  Results:   Here, we demonstrate that prostate and breast cancers within The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) exhibit frequent copy number loss of CTCF and that this loss is associated with increased DNA methylation events that occur preferentially at CTCF binding sites. CTCF sites differ among tumor types and result in tissue-specific methylation patterns with little overlap between breast and prostate cancers. DNA methylation and transcriptome profiling in vitro establish that forced downregulation of CTCF leads to spatially distinct DNA hypermethylation surrounding CTCF binding sites, loss of CTCF binding, and decreased gene expression that is also seen in human tumors. DNA methylation inhibition reverses loss of expression at these CTCF-regulated genes.

Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA), a transmembrane protein that is known for its use in diagnostics and targeted therapy in prostate cancer, is also expressed by AdCC. This study aimed to analyse PSMA expression in a large cohort of primary, recurrent and metastasized AdCC of the head and neck.  Methods:   One hundred ten consecutive patients with histologically confirmed AdCC in the period 1990-2017 were included. An analysis was made of clinical details, revised pathology and semiquantitative immunohistochemical expression of PSMA on tissue microarray and whole slides. Associations of PSMA expression with clinicopathological parameters were explored and survival was analysed by multivariate Cox-proportional Hazard analysis.  Results:   PSMA expression was present in 94% of the 110 primary tumours, with a median of 31% positive cells (IQR 15-60%). Primary tumours (n = 18) that recurred (n = 15) and/or had metastases (n = 10) demonstrated 40, 60 and 23% expression respectively. Expression was not independently related to increased pathological stage, tumour grade, and the occurrence of locoregional recurrence or metastasis. After dichotomization, only primary tumour PSMA expression ≤10% appeared to be associated with reduced 10-years recurrence-free survival (HR 3.0, 95% CI 1.1-8.5, p = .04).  Conclusions:   PSMA is highly expressed in primary, recurrent and metastatic AdCC of the salivary and seromucous glands. PSMA expression has no value in predicting clinical behaviour of AdCC although low expression may indicate a reduced recurrence-free survival. This study provides supporting results to consider using PSMA as target for imaging and therapy when other diagnostic and palliative treatment options fail.""","""['Thomas J W Klein Nulent', 'Matthijs H Valstar', 'Laura A Smit', 'Ludwig E Smeele', 'Nicolaas P A Zuithoff', 'Bart de Keizer', 'Remco de Bree', 'Robert J J van Es', 'Stefan M Willems']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Prostate-specific membrane antigen PET imaging and immunohistochemistry in adenoid cystic carcinoma-\ufeffa preliminary analysis.', 'High CXCR4 expression in adenoid cystic carcinoma of the head and neck is associated with increased risk of locoregional recurrence.', 'Risk factors for survival and distant metastasis in 125 patients with head and neck adenoid cystic carcinoma undergoing primary surgery.', 'Utility of 68 Ga prostate specific membrane antigen - positron emission tomography in diagnosis and response assessment of recurrent renal cell carcinoma.', 'Chemotherapy and targeted therapy in adenoid cystic carcinoma of the head and neck: a review.', 'Trigeminal nerve perineural invasion by an adenoid cystic carcinoma of the maxillary sinus, detected by 68Ga-PSMA.', 'Recent Progress in Second Near-Infrared (NIR-II) Fluorescence Imaging in Cancer.', 'A pilot study of 68\xa0Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT imaging and 177Lu-EB-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy in patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma.', 'PSMA PET Imaging and Therapy in Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma and Other Salivary Gland Cancers: A Systematic Review.', 'Metastatic Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma: Genomic Landscape and Emerging Treatments.']"""

The four selected CNNs are FCN, SegNet, U-Net, and DeepLabV3+, which was originally proposed for the segmentation of road scene, biomedical, and natural images. Segmentation of prostate in T2W MRI images is an important step in the automatic diagnosis of prostate cancer to enable better lesion detection and staging of prostate cancer. Therefore, many research efforts have been conducted to improve the segmentation of the prostate gland in MRI images. The main challenges of prostate gland segmentation are blurry prostate boundary and variability in prostate anatomical structure. In this work, we investigated the performance of encoder-decoder CNNs for segmentation of prostate gland in T2W MRI. Image pre-processing techniques including image resizing, center-cropping and intensity normalization are applied to address the issues of inter-patient and inter-scanner variability as well as the issue of dominating background pixels over prostate pixels. In addition, to enrich the network with more data, to increase data variation, and to improve its accuracy, patch extraction and data augmentation are applied prior to training the networks. Furthermore, class weight balancing is used to avoid having biased networks since the number of background pixels is much higher than the prostate pixels. The class imbalance problem is solved by utilizing weighted cross-entropy loss function during the training of the CNN model. The performance of the CNNs is evaluated in terms of the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and our experimental results show that patch-wise DeepLabV3+ gives the best performance with DSC equal to 92 . 8 % . This value is the highest DSC score compared to the FCN, SegNet, and U-Net that also competed the recently published state-of-the-art method of prostate segmentation.""","""['Zia Khan', 'Norashikin Yahya', 'Khaled Alsaih', 'Syed Saad Azhar Ali', 'Fabrice Meriaudeau']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Sensors (Basel)""","""['Convolutional neural network-based pelvic floor structure segmentation using magnetic resonance imaging in pelvic organ prolapse.', 'A comparative study of pre-trained convolutional neural networks for semantic segmentation of breast tumors in ultrasound.', 'Fully automatic, multiorgan segmentation in normal whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), using classification forests (CFs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and a multi-atlas (MA) approach.', 'Deep convolutional neural networks for brain image analysis on magnetic resonance imaging: a review.', 'Automatic Segmentation of Multiple Organs on 3D CT Images by Using Deep Learning Approaches.', 'Region-specific deep learning models for accurate segmentation of rectal structures on post-chemoradiation T2w MRI: a multi-institutional, multi-reader study.', 'Generative Adversarial Networks Can Create High Quality Artificial Prostate Cancer Magnetic Resonance Images.', 'CROPro: a tool for automated cropping of prostate magnetic resonance images.', 'Automated prostate multi-regional segmentation in magnetic resonance using fully convolutional neural networks.', 'Adaptive IoU Thresholding for Improving Small Object Detection: A Proof-of-Concept Study of Hand Erosions Classification of Patients with Rheumatic Arthritis on X-ray Images.']"""

The underlying mechanism in humans is not understood. Experimental studies in mice have shown that castration facilitates atherogenesis and may increase signs of plaque vulnerability. Pigs used for translational atherosclerosis research have frequently been castrated for practical or commercial reasons, but the effect of castration on atherosclerosis has never been systematically evaluated in pigs.  Objective:   To study the effect of castration on atherosclerotic plaque burden and type in genetically modified minipigs with hypercholesterolemia.  Methods:   Newborn male Yucatan minipigs with transgenic overexpression of a human gain-of-function mutant of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 were randomized to undergo orchiectomy (n = 8) or serve as controls (n = 6). Minipigs were started on high-fat diet at 3 months of age and the amount and composition of atherosclerotic lesions were analyzed at 12 months of age. Plasma lipid profiles and behavioral parameters were also assessed.  Results:   Plasma lipids were slightly affected to a more atherogenic profile by orchiectomy, but atherosclerotic lesion size was unaltered in the LAD, thoracic aorta, abdominal aorta, and iliac arteries. The distribution of lesion types (xanthomas, pathological intimal thickening and fibroatheromas) were also not statistically different between groups in any of the examined vascular territories. The abdominal aorta developed the most advanced stages of disease with reproducible fibroatheroma formation, and here it was found that the area of necrotic core was significantly increased in orchiectomized pigs compared with controls. Orchiectomy also reduced aggressive behavior.  Conclusions:   Castration does not alter the burden of atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic Yucatan minipigs, but may increase necrotic core area in fibroatheromas.""","""['Jeong T Shim', 'Nikolaj Schmidt', 'Paula Nogales', 'Torben Larsen', 'Charlotte B Sørensen', 'Jacob F Bentzon']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Analysis of 18F-Sodium Fluoride Positron Emission Tomography Signal Sources in Atherosclerotic Minipigs Shows Specific Binding of 18F-Sodium Fluoride to Plaque Calcifications.', 'Diabetes with poor glycaemic control does not promote atherosclerosis in genetically modified hypercholesterolaemic minipigs.', 'Ossabaw Pigs With a PCSK9 Gain-of-Function Mutation Develop Accelerated Coronary Atherosclerotic Lesions: A Novel Model for Preclinical Studies.', 'Human-like atherosclerosis in minipigs: a new model for detection and treatment of vulnerable plaques.', 'Accelerated miniature swine models of advanced atherosclerosis: A review based on morphology.', 'Testosterone deficiency accelerates early stage atherosclerosis in miniature pigs fed a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet: urine 1H NMR metabolomics targeted analysis.']"""

Their predictive value has been less clearly demonstrated with prostate cancer (PCa), particularly, their utility within active surveillance (AS) protocols. We aim to evaluate NLR and PLR in AS patients.  Methods:   We identified 98 patients who met inclusion criteria in our cohort of 274 men diagnosed with PCa on AS.

Robustly optimized plans in regard to bowel filling may improve the dose coverage in the treatment course. Our purpose is to investigate the effect of air volume in large and small bowel and rectum on target dose from IMPT plans.  Methods and material:   Data from 17 cancer patients (11 prostate, 3 gynecologic, 2 colon, and 1 embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma) with planning CT (pCT) and weekly or biweekly scanned quality assurance CTs (QACTs; 82 QACT scans total) were studied. Air in bowels and rectum traversed by proton pencil beams was contoured. The robust treatment plan was made by using 3 CT sets: the pCT set and 2 virtual CT sets that were copies of pCT but in which the fillings of bowels and rectum were overridden to be either air or muscle. Each plan had 2-5 beams with a mean of 3 beams. Targets in the pCT were mapped to the QACTs by deformable image registration, and the dose in QACTs was calculated. Dose coverage (D99 and D95) and correlations between dose coverage and changes in air volume were analyzed. The significance of the correlation was analyzed by t test.  Results:   Mean changes of D99 in QACTs were within 3% of those in the pCT for all prostate and colon cases but >3% in 2 of the 3 gynecologic cases and in the embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma case. Of these three cases with mean change of D99 > 3%, air volume may be the main cause in 2. For the prostate cases, correlation coefficients were <0.7 between change in air volume and change in D99 and D95, because other anatomy changes also contributed to dose deviation. Correlation coefficients in the non-prostate cases were >0.9 between D99 change and rectum and between D95 change and small bowel, indicating a greater effect of the air volume on target dose.  Conclusion:   The air volume may still have an important effect on target dose coverage in treatment plans using 3 CT sets, particularly when the air is traversed by multiple beams.""","""['Weiguang Yao', 'Noah Schweitzer', 'Nrusingh Biswal', 'Jerimy Polf', 'Jonathan Farr', 'Zeljko Vujaskovic']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Validation of rectal sparing throughout the course of proton therapy treatment in prostate cancer patients treated with SpaceOAR®.', 'Treatment planning comparison of IMPT, VMAT and 4π radiotherapy for prostate cases.', 'Multiple-CT optimization of intensity-modulated proton therapy - Is it possible to eliminate adaptive planning?', 'Multiple-CT optimization: An adaptive optimization method to account for anatomical changes in intensity-modulated proton therapy for head and neck cancers.', 'Impact of Spot Size and Spacing on the Quality of Robustly Optimized Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy Plans for Lung Cancer.']"""

We aimed to compare the generic and disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among men with prostate cancer in the screening arm with the control arm of the PSA-based prostate cancer screening trial in up to 15 years of follow-up.  Materials and methods:   This study was conducted within population-based Finnish Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (FinRSPC). During 1996-1999 80,458 men were randomized to the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening arm (SA, N = 32 000) and the control arm (CA, N = 48 458). Men in the screening arm were screened at 4-year intervals until 2007. HRQOL questionnaires were delivered to newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients in the screening and control arm 1996-2006 (N = 5128) at the time of diagnosis (baseline), at 3-month, 12-month and 5, 10, and 15-year follow-up. Validated UCLA Prostate Cancer Index (UCLA-PCI) and RAND 36-Item Health Survey were used for HRQOL assessment. The data were analyzed with a random effects model for repeated measures.  Results:   At baseline, men with prostate cancer in the screening arm reported better Sexual Function, as well as less Sexual and Urinary Bother. Long-term follow-up revealed slightly higher HRQOL scores in the screening arm in prostate cancer specific measures at 10-year post diagnosis, but the differences were statistically significant only in Urinary Bother (UCLA-PCI score 77.9; 95% CI 75.2 to 80.5 vs. 70.9; 95% CI 66.8 to 74.9 P = .005). The generic HRQOL scores were comparable between the trial arms. The overall differences in disease-specific or generic HRQOL scores by trial arm did not vary during the follow-up.

Augmented reality (AR) can help during RALRP by showing the surgeon the location of anatomical structures and tumors from preoperative imaging. Previously, we proposed hand-eye and camera intrinsic matrix estimation procedures that can be carried out with conventional instruments within the patient during surgery, take < 3 min to perform, and fit seamlessly in the existing surgical workflow. In this paper, we describe and evaluate a complete AR guidance system for RALRP and quantify its accuracy.  Methods:   Our AR system requires three transformations: the transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) to da Vinci transformation, the camera intrinsic matrix, and the hand-eye transformation. For evaluation, a 3D-printed cross-wire was visualized in TRUS and stereo endoscope in a water bath. Manually triangulated cross-wire points from stereo images were used as ground truth to evaluate overall TRE between these points and points transformed from TRUS to camera.  Results:   After transforming the ground-truth points from the TRUS to the camera coordinate frame, the mean target registration error (TRE) (SD) was [Formula: see text] mm. The mean TREs (SD) in the x-, y-, and z-directions are [Formula: see text] mm, [Formula: see text] mm, and [Formula: see text] mm, respectively.  Conclusions:   We describe and evaluate a complete AR guidance system for RALRP which can augment preoperative data to endoscope camera image, after a deformable magnetic resonance image to TRUS registration step. The streamlined procedures with current surgical workflow and low TRE demonstrate the compatibility and readiness of the system for clinical translation.

There is a need to improve the clinical understanding and treatment of this disease, particularly in the real-world setting and among patients who are under-represented in clinical trials.  Objective:   We aimed to evaluate the characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients who received their first treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in routine clinical practice, independent of treatment used, including subgroups with baseline cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus, or visceral metastases.  Patients and methods:   Prospective, noninterventional analysis of patient record data in the multicenter Prostate Cancer Registry (PCR) of men with mCRPC. The data were collected in 16 countries with the aim of recruiting more than 3000 patients between 2013 and 2016. The study end date was 9 July 2018. Data evaluated included baseline characteristics, treatment exposure, and efficacy outcomes [overall survival (OS) and time to progression (TTP)] of patients treated with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or prednisolone (collectively, ""abiraterone""), enzalutamide, or docetaxel. Descriptive outcomes are reported from the overall patient population and subgroups of patients with baseline cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, or visceral metastases. The treatment effects for time to progression were compared for the overall patient population.  Results:   The study enrollment period lasted 2.5 years, and each patient was followed for a maximum of 3 years. A total of 1874 patients in the PCR had not received previous mCRPC treatment at baseline, although they had received androgen-deprivation therapy. Prevalent co-morbidities included cardiovascular disease in 65.4% and diabetes mellitus in 17.4% of patients. Baseline characteristics suggested that patients with more advanced disease received docetaxel treatment. In the overall patient population, the median time to progression with abiraterone, enzalutamide, and docetaxel as first-line mCRPC therapy was 9.6, 10.3, and 7.6 months, respectively, and median OS was 27.1, 27.1, and 27.9 months, respectively. Outcomes in the subgroups of patients with cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus were similar to those of the whole population in the analysis.

Identifying more miRNAs as biomarkers for clinical diagnosis, treatment and prognosis is vital to promote the development of bioinformatics and medicine. Considering that the traditional biological experimental methods are generally time-consuming and expensive, high-efficient computational methods are encouraged to uncover potential disease-related miRNAs. In this paper, FCGCNMDA is presented to predict latent miRNA-disease associations by utilizing fully connected graph convolutional networks. Specially, our method first constructs a fully connected graph in which edge weights represent correlation coefficient between any two pairs of miRNA-disease pair, and then feeds this fully connected graph along with miRNA-disease pairs feature matrix into a two-layer graph convolutional networks (GCN) for training. At last, we utilize the trained network to predict the scores for unknown miRNA-disease pairs. As a result, FCGCNMDA achieves AUC value of [Formula: see text] and AUPRC value of [Formula: see text] in HMDD v2.0 based on five-fold cross validation. Moreover, case studies on Lymphoma, Breast Neoplasms and Prostate Neoplasms shown that 98%, 98%, 98% of the top 50 selected miRNAs were validated by recent experimental evidence. From above results, we can deduce that FCGCNMDA can be regarded as reliable method for potential miRNA-disease associations prediction.""","""['Jiashu Li', 'Zhengwei Li', 'Ru Nie', 'Zhuhong You', 'Wenzhang Bao']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Genet Genomics""","""['Computational method using heterogeneous graph convolutional network model combined with reinforcement layer for MiRNA-disease association prediction.', 'MDHGI: Matrix Decomposition and Heterogeneous Graph Inference for miRNA-disease association prediction.', 'A Novel Computational Model for Predicting microRNA-Disease Associations Based on Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Networks.', 'MicroRNAs and complex diseases: from experimental results to computational models.', 'Review of MiRNA-Disease Association Prediction.', 'PDA-PRGCN: identification of Piwi-interacting RNA-disease associations through subgraph projection and residual scaling-based feature augmentation.', 'Computational method using heterogeneous graph convolutional network model combined with reinforcement layer for MiRNA-disease association prediction.', 'DNRLCNN: A CNN Framework for Identifying MiRNA-Disease Associations Using Latent Feature Matrix Extraction with Positive Samples.', 'GCAEMDA: Predicting miRNA-disease associations via graph convolutional autoencoder.', 'Efficient framework for predicting MiRNA-disease associations based on improved hybrid collaborative filtering.']"""

Methods:   114 consecutive patients who received multiparametric 3 T MRI of the prostate at our institution were retrospectively enrolled. 63 patients self-administered a preparatory micro-enema prior to imaging, and 51 patients underwent MRI without bowel preparation. Two blinded readers independently reviewed the diffusion-weighted sequences regarding gas-induced artefacts. The presence/severity of artefacts was scored ranging from 0 (no artefact) to 3 (severe artefact). A score ≥ 2 was considered a clinically relevant artefact. Maximum rectal width at the level of the prostate was correlated with the administration of a micro-enema. Scores were compared between the scans performed with and without bowel preparation using univariable and multivariable logistic regression, taking into account potential confounding factors (age and prostate volume).  Results:   Significantly less artefacts were found on diffusion-weighted sequences after the administration of a micro-enema shortly prior to MR imaging. Clinically relevant artefacts were found in 10% in the patient group after enema, in 41% without enema. If present, artefacts were also significantly less severe. Mean severity score was 0.3 (enema administered) and 1.2 (no enema), and odds ratio was 0.137 (p < 0.0001) in univariable ordinal logistic regression.

Adoptive immunotherapy appears a promising strategy to control the advanced stages of the disease by specifically targeting the tumor, in particular through chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy. Despite the advancements of CAR-T technology in the treatment of hematological malignancies, solid tumors still represent a challenge. To overcome current limits, other cellular effectors than T lymphocytes are under study as possible candidates for CAR-engineered cancer immunotherapy. A novel approach involves the NK-92 cell line, which mediates strong cytotoxic responses against a variety of tumor cells but has no effect on non-malignant healthy counterparts. Here, we report a novel therapeutic approach against PCa based on engineering of NK-92 cells with a CAR recognizing the human prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), which is overexpressed in prostatic neoplastic cells. More importantly, the potential utility of NK-92/CAR cells to treat PCa has not yet been explored. Upon CAR transduction, NK-92/CAR cells acquired high and specific lytic activity against PSMA-expressing prostate cancer cells in vitro, and also underwent degranulation and produced high levels of IFN-γ in response to antigen recognition. Lethal irradiation of the effectors, a safety measure requested for the clinical application of retargeted NK-92 cells, fully abrogated replication but did not impact on phenotype and short-term functionality. PSMA-specific recognition and antitumor activity were retained in vivo, as adoptive transfer of irradiated NK-92/CAR cells in prostate cancer-bearing mice restrained tumor growth and improved survival. Anti-PSMA CAR-modified NK-92 cells represent a universal, off-the-shelf, renewable, and cost-effective product endowed with relevant potentialities as a therapeutic approach for PCa immunotherapy.""","""['Isabella Monia Montagner', 'Alessandro Penna', 'Giulio Fracasso', 'Debora Carpanese', 'Anna Dalla Pietà', 'Vito Barbieri', 'Gaia Zuccolotto', 'Antonio Rosato']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cells""","""['Purinergic targeting enhances immunotherapy of CD73+ solid tumors with piggyBac-engineered chimeric antigen receptor natural killer cells.', 'Adoptive Transfer of NKG2D CAR mRNA-Engineered Natural Killer Cells in Colorectal Cancer Patients.', 'Irradiated chimeric antigen receptor engineered NK-92MI cells show effective cytotoxicity against CD19+ malignancy in a mouse model.', 'CAR-NK Cells: From Natural Basis to Design for Kill.', 'CAR-NK cell in cancer immunotherapy; A promising frontier.', 'Emerging therapies targeting the delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3) in small cell lung cancer.', 'Anti-tumor efficacy of anti-GD2 CAR NK-92 cells in diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas.', 'New cell sources for CAR-based immunotherapy.', 'Engineered human pluripotent stem cell-derived natural killer cells with PD-L1 responsive immunological memory for enhanced immunotherapeutic efficacy.', 'Engineered anti-prostate cancer CAR-neutrophils from human pluripotent stem cells.']"""

Therefore, studies on the combination of autophagy inhibitors with drugs are increasing as a new treatment modality in cancer. Previously, we reported the anti-tumor activity of a Palladium (Pd)(II) complex against different types of cancer in vitro and in vivo. Chloroquine (CQ), the worldwide used anti-malarial drug, has recently been focused as a chemosensitizer in cancer treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a combined treatment of these agents that work through different mechanisms to provide an effective treatment modality for metastatic prostate cancer that is certainly fatal. Metastatic prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3 and LNCaP) were treated with Pd (II) complex, CQ, and their combination. The combination enhanced apoptosis by increasing phosphatidylserine translocation and pro-apoptotic proteins. Apoptosis was confirmed by the use of apoptosis inhibitor. The formation of acidic vesicular organelles (AVOs) was observed by acridine orange staining in fluorescence microscopy. The Pd (II) complex increased AVOs formation in prostate cancer cells and CQ-pretreatment has potentiated this effect.

Herein, in a larger RP cohort, the authors investigated whether the association between obesity and long-term PC outcomes, including PCSM, differed by race.  Methods:   Data from 5929 patients who underwent RP and were in the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database were analyzed. Prior to RP, body mass index (BMI) was measured and recorded in the medical records. BMI was categorized as normal weight (<25 kg/m2 ), overweight (25-29.9 kg/m2 ), and obese (≥30 kg/m2 ). The authors assessed the association between BMI and biochemical disease recurrence (BCR), castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), metastasis, and PCSM, accounting for confounders.  Results:   Of the 5929 patients, 1983 (33%) were black, 1321 (22%) were of normal weight, 2605 (44%) were overweight, and 2003 (34%) were obese. Compared with white men, black men were younger; had higher prostate-specific antigen levels; and were more likely to have a BMI ≥30 kg/m2 , seminal vesicle invasion, and positive surgical margins (all P ≤ .032). During a median follow-up of 7.4 years, a total of 1891 patients (32%) developed BCR, 181 patients (3%) developed CRPC, 259 patients (4%) had metastasis, and 135 patients (2%) had died of PC. On multivariable analysis, obesity was found to be associated with an increased risk of PCSM (hazard ratio, 1.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-3.04 [P = .035]). No interaction was found between BMI and race in predicting PCSM (P ≥ .88), BCR (P ≥ .81), CRPC (P ≥ .88), or metastasis (P ≥ .60). Neither overweight nor obesity was associated with risk of BCR, CRPC, or metastasis (all P ≥ .18).

To our knowledge, the extent of financial conflicts of interest (FCOIs) in National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines have not been systemically evaluated. The current study evaluated the extent of FCOIs in the NCCN CPGs for the most common malignancies in the United States.  Methods:   The authors examined the latest 2019 versions of the NCCN CPGs for the 10 most common cancers by incidence in the United States. Using disclosure lists, they catalogued the FCOIs for the panelists under various categories outlined in the CPG. The authors also tabulated the companies and institutions involved in each panel disclosure. An ""episode"" describes 1 instance of participation of a panelist in 1 company in 1 category of each guideline. ""Affiliation"" describes an industrial, commercial, or institutional affiliation reported by a panelist in each episode.  Results:   Of the 491 panelists on the CPG panel, 483 (98.3%) completed FCOI disclosures. A total of 224 (46.4%) reported at least 1 FCOI episode. A total of 1103 episodes were disclosed with an average of 4.9 episodes reported per panelist with FCOIs. Acting as part of scientific advisory boards, as a consultant, or as an expert witness was the most common FCOI category (19.9%). A total of 191 companies were associated with 1103 episodes of FCOI. The top companies were Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, Genentech, and AstraZeneca. Among cancers, the prevalence of FCOIs was highest for lung cancer (56%), bladder cancer (52%), pancreatic cancer (52%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (50%), kidney cancer (49%), colorectal cancer (43%), breast cancer (42%), melanoma (40%), prostate cancer (38%), and uterine cancer (32%). Among the panelists with FCOIs, 26%, 17%, and 57%, respectively, reported 1, 2, and >3 episodes. There were 127 episodes noted among the CPG chairs and/or vice chairs who reported FCOIs (mean, 6.4 episodes). The chairs and/or vice chairs of CPGs for uterine cancer, pancreatic cancer, melanoma, and prostate cancer were not found to have any FCOIs.  Conclusions:   FCOIs are very prevalent among NCCN CPG panelists. In nearly one-half of the CPGs, the majority of the panelists had at least 1 FCOI. Greater than one-half of the CPG chairs and/or vice chairs reported multiple FCOIs.

In this pilot study, we determine whether mCRPC patients can be discriminated from healthy controls based on detection of tdEVs (< 1μm, EpCAM+) and/or other EVs, in cell-free plasma and/or urine. The presence of marker+ EVs in plasma and urine samples from mCRPC patients (n = 5) and healthy controls (n = 5) was determined by flow cytometry (FCM) and surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi) using an antibody panel and lactadherin. For FCM, the concentrations of marker positive (+) particles and EVs (refractive index <1.42) were determined. Only the lactadherin+ particle and EV concentration in plasma measured by FCM differed significantly between patients and controls (p = 0.017). All other markers did not result in signals exceeding the background on both FCM and SPRi, or did not differ significantly between patients and controls. In conclusion, no difference was found between patients and controls based on the detection of tdEVs. For FCM, the measured sample volumes are too small to detect tdEVs. For SPRi, the concentration of tdEVs is probably too low to be detected. Thus, to detect tdEVs in cell-free plasma and/or urine, EV enrichment and/or concentration is required.

Materials and methods:   We evaluated 454 men who underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging between 2006 and 2018 with maximum GG1 prostate cancer inclusive of magnetic resonance imaging targeted biopsy. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging was graded as negative, equivocal or positive. Assessed outcomes were treatment-free survival, biopsy upgrade-free survival and unfavorable disease at radical prostatectomy (pT 3 or greater and/or GG3 or greater). Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox proportional hazard analyses were used to estimate the impact of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and clinicopathological variables (age, year, prostate specific antigen density and measures of tumor volume on biopsy) on outcomes.  Results:   During followup (median 45.2 months) 61 men had disease upgraded on followup biopsy and 139 underwent definitive treatment. In men with negative, equivocal and positive baseline multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging at 5 years, treatment-free survival was 79%, 73% and 49% (p <0.0001), treatment-free survival was 89%, 82% and 70% (p=0.002), and survival without unfavorable disease at radical prostatectomy was 98%, 98% and 86% (p=0.007), respectively.

Methods:   Two groups of samples, a training set (n = 41 PCa and n = 42 controls) and an external validation set (n = 18 PCa and n = 18 controls) were analyzed using a dual analytical platform, namely gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR).  Results:   The multivariate analysis models revealed a good discrimination between cases and controls with an AUC higher than 0.8, a sensitivity ranging from 67 to 89%, a specificity ranging from 74 to 89% and an accuracy from 73 to 86%, considering the training and external validation sets.

Moreover, treatment is challenging because anatomical variants, comorbidities, and associated treatments, which raises the concern of using radiotherapy (RT). RT has been discouraged due to the increased risk of urethral/ureteral stricture and KT dysfunction.  Materials and methods:   We reviewed the electronic health records and digital planning system of patients treated with pelvic RT between December 2013 and December 2018 to identify patients with previous KT.  Cases description:   We describe three successful cases of KT patients in which modern techniques allowed full standard RT for pelvic malignances (2 prostate and 1 vaginal cancer) with or without elective pelvic nodal RT, without allograft toxicity at short and long follow-up (up to 60 months).  Conclusion:   When needed, RT modern techniques remain a valid option with excellent oncologic results and acceptable toxicity. Physicians should give special considerations to accomplish all OAR dose constraints in the patient's specific setting. Recent publications recommend KT mean dose <4 Gy, but graft proximity to CTV makes this unfeasible. We present 2 cases where dose constraint was not achieved, and to a short follow-up of 20 months renal toxicity has not been documented. We recommend the lowest possible mean dose to the KT, but never compromising the CTV coverage, since morbimortality from recurrent or progressive cancer disease outweighs the risk of graft injury.""","""['Pérez Álvarez Sandra Ileana', 'Ramos Prudencio Rubi', 'Lozano Ruiz Francisco Javier', 'Macías González Monserrat Del Sagrario', 'Flores Balcazar Christian Haydeé']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Rep Pract Oncol Radiother""","""['Radiotherapy for the treatment of pituitary adenomas: A dosimetric comparison of three planning techniques.', 'Elective nodal radiotherapy with a gapless radiation field junction for oligorecurrent prostate cancer after previous radiotherapy.', 'Importance of Technique, Target Selection, Contouring, Dose Prescription, and Dose-Planning in External Beam Radiation Therapy for Cervical Cancer: Evolution of Practice From EMBRACE-I to II.', 'Cardiotoxicity of mediastinal radiotherapy.', 'Safety of Radiation Therapy in Patients With Prostate Cancer and Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review.']"""

To this end, systems pharmacology modeling provides a quantitative framework to test in silico the efficacy of new treatments and combination therapies. In this paper we present a new Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) model of prostate cancer immunotherapy, calibrated using data from pre-clinical experiments in prostate cancer mouse models. We developed the model by using Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) describing the tumor, key components of the immune system, and seven treatments. Numerous combination therapies were evaluated considering both the degree of tumor inhibition and the predicted synergistic effects, integrated into a decision tree. Our simulations predicted cancer vaccine combined with immune checkpoint blockade as the most effective dual-drug combination immunotherapy for subjects treated with androgen-deprivation therapy that developed resistance.

Despite recognition of IFNγ signaling effects on host defense against viral infection and its utility in immunotherapy and tumor progression, the roles of genetic variants of the IFNγ signaling pathway genes in survival of patients with cancer remain unknown.  Methods:   We used a discovery genotyping dataset from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (n = 1,185) and a replication genotyping dataset from the Harvard Lung Cancer Susceptibility Study (n = 984) to evaluate associations between 14,553 genetic variants in 150 IFNγ pathway genes and survival of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Results:   The combined analysis identified two independent potentially functional SNPs, ELP2 rs7242481G>A and PIAS1 rs1049493T>C, to be significantly associated with NSCLC survival, with a combined HR of 0.85 (95% confidence interval, 0.78-0.92; P < 0.0001) and 0.87 (0.81-0.93; P < 0.0001), respectively. Expression quantitative trait loci analyses showed that the survival-associated ELP2 rs7242481A allele was significantly associated with increased mRNA expression levels of elongator acetyltransferase complex subunit 2 (ELP2) in 373 lymphoblastoid cell lines and 369 whole-blood samples. The PIAS1 rs1049493C allele was significantly associated with decreased mRNA expression levels of PIAS1 in 383 normal lung tissues and 369 whole-blood samples.

Tumor stroma promotes tumor proliferation, invasion, and metastasis, but how stromal lipids influence these processes remain to be defined. Here, we show that stromal CAVIN1 regulates lipid abundance in the prostate cancer microenvironment and suppresses metastasis. We show that depletion of CAVIN1 in prostate stromal cells markedly reduces their lipid droplet accumulation and increases inflammation. Stromal cells lacking CAVIN1 enhance prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. Remarkably, they increase lipid uptake and M2 inflammatory macrophage infiltration in the primary tumors and metastasis to distant sites. Our data support the concept that stromal cells contribute to prostate cancer aggressiveness by modulating lipid content and inflammation in the tumor microenvironment.

Materials and methods:   Three hundred eighty-nine patients in AS underwent mpMRI before confirmatory or follow-up biopsy. Patients with negative (-) mpMRI underwent systematic random biopsy. Patients with positive (+) mpMRI underwent targeted fusion prostate biopsies + systematic random biopsies. Different PSAD cutoff values were tested (< 0.10, 0.10-0.20, ≥ 0.20). Multivariable analyses assessed the risk of reclassification, defined as clinically significant prostate cancer of grade group 2 or more, during follow-up according to PSAD, after adjusting for covariates.  Results:   One hundred twenty-seven (32.6%) patients had mpMRI(-); 72 (18.5%) had PI-RADS 3, 150 (38.6%) PI-RADS 4, and 40 (10.3%) PI-RADS 5 lesions. The rate of reclassification to grade group 2 PCa was 16%, 22%, 31%, and 39% for mpMRI(-) and PI-RADS 3, 4, and 5, respectively, in case of PSAD < 0.10 ng/mL2; 16%, 25%, 36%, and 44%, in case of PSAD 0.10 to 0.19 ng/mL2; and 25%, 42%, 55%, and 67% in case of PSAD ≥ 0.20 ng/mL2.

Conclusion:   PSAD ≥ 0.20 ng/mL2 may improve predictive accuracy of mpMRI results for reclassification of patients in AS, whereas PSAD < 0.10 ng/mL2 may help selection of patients at lower risk of harboring clinically significant prostate cancer.

The characteristics of 242 consecutive prostate biopsy series performed between 2017 January and 2019 October for abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) and/or PSA>4ng/mL are also described.

Background:   Ciprofloxacin with excellent pharmacokinetic properties as well as few side effects, is one of the most common used antibacterial agents. Notably, Ciprofloxacin could induce cancer cells apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest at the S/G2 stage. The structure-activity relationship reveals that the introduction of the methoxy group into the C-8 position of the fluoroquinolone moiety has resulted in a greater binding affinity to the binding site, and 8-methoxy ciprofloxacin derivatives have proved a variety of biological activities even against drug-resistant organisms. However, to the best of our current knowledge, there are no studies that have reported the anticancer activity of 8-methoxy ciprofloxacin derivatives so far. Furthermore, many fluoroquinolone-hydrazone/acylhydrazone hybrids possess promising anticancer activity. Thus, it is rational to screen the anticancer activity of 8-methoxy ciprofloxacin derivatives.

Methods:   Data of 784 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy during 2001-2017 were evaluated retrospectively. Before surgery, patients' demographic information, pathologic stage, margin of surgery, prostate-specific antigen, and Gleason score were obtained. Then, serum prostate-specific antigen level, urinary continence, potency, and other functional outcomes of surgery were recorded after each postoperative visit.  Results:   The mean age (±standard deviation) of patients was 61.3 (±6.30) years. The median (IQ25-75) duration of follow-up was 30 (12-72) months. Full continence was achieved in 90% and 95.9% of patients at 3 and 6 months post surgery and 96.4% of the patients were continent at the last follow-up visit. Bladder neck stricture occurred in 167 patients (21.3%). During the follow-up period, none of the patients complained of total incontinence and at the last visit, 36.6% of patients reported potency. The frequency of grade 2 continence was significantly higher in patients with high-stage tumors (T3/T4), high Gleason score (⩾8), high preoperative serum prostate-specific antigen (>20 ng/dL), and positive margin of surgery. Potency had a significant relationship with age, stage of the disease, and preoperative prostate-specific antigen.  Conclusion:   Maximal sparing of intrapelvic urethral length through sutureless vesico-urethral alignment technique results in excellent early urinary continence recovery after radical prostatectomy.

Materials and methods:   T2 weighted images from 36 consecutive PI-RADS 2 and 3 cases with volume adapted systematic transperineal biopsy as reference standard (all biopsies negative, 34.8 biopsy cores per patient in average, mean PSA level 10.77 ng/mL) are manually segmented to define transition zone (TZ) volume. 54 radiomic features (RF) are derived for each TZ. RF are tested for significant correlation with PSA level, Bonferroni correction is applied. We build regression models to explain PSA level with a) TZ volume b) RF c) TZ volume+RF. We apply all models to a control group with clinically significant transition zone cancer.  Results:   TZ volume is moderately correlated with PSA level (r = 0.44). 5/54 RF are significantly correlated with PSA level (r: 0.53-0.69, p < 0.05). Inclusion of each of these five features into the regression model significantly improves the explanatory value for PSA level (p < 0.05). Furthermore, RF alone better explain PSA level compared to TZ volume alone (p < 0.01). A systematic and significant trend for positive residuals is observed when regression models are applied to the malignant control group.  Conclusion:   A radiomics analysis of the transition zone has the potential to improve explanation of corresponding PSA level in patients with low suspicion.

From April 2015 to May 2019, 71 patients with mCRPC were treated with abiraterone acetate (N = 34) or enzalutamide (N = 37) at our institution. Resistance to treatment was defined as radiological or scintigraphic progression within 3 months, as documented at the first control. After a median follow-up of 14.9 months, resistance was detected in 22 patients (31%). Many of the baseline characteristics differed between responders and nonresponders but did not serve as predictors with clinically acceptable certainty. To overcome this, the resistance score was defined as the number of positive out of the following six predictors: Most patients with resistance and a few responders had >3 positive predictors. Therefore, by using a cutoff of four positive predictors, the resistance score showed both a high sensitivity of 82% [57-96%; 95% confidence interval (CI)] and a specificity of 88% (74-96%; 95% CI).

We aimed to determine the clinical utility of transperineal nontargeted systematic prostate biopsies, when performed alongside targeted systematic prostate biopsies, using pre-biopsy multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging.  Materials and methods:   Consecutive patients referred with a suspicion of prostate cancer (April 2017 to October 2019) underwent pre-biopsy multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging. A transperineal biopsy was advised if multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging PI-RADS® (v.2.0) score was 4 or 5, and score 3 required a prostate specific antigen density 0.12 ng/ml or greater. Primary threshold for clinically significant prostate cancer was defined as any Gleason 3+4 or greater. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified pre-biopsy predictors of clinically significant prostate cancer in nontargeted systematic prostate biopsies, regardless of targeted pathology (p <0.05, R, version 3.5.1).  Results:   A total of 1,719 men underwent a pre-biopsy multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, with 679 (39.5%) proceeding to combined targeted systematic prostate biopsies and nontargeted systematic prostate biopsies. In these men clinically significant prostate cancer was detected in 333 (49%) and 139 (20.5%) with targeted systematic prostate biopsies and nontargeted systematic prostate biopsies, respectively.

Purpose To validate ex vivo diffusion-relaxation correlation spectrum imaging (DR-CSI) in the characterization of microstructural tissue compartments in prostate specimens from men with PCa by using registered whole-mount digital histopathology (WMHP) as the reference standard. Materials and Methods Men with PCa who underwent 3-T MRI and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy between June 2018 and January 2019 were prospectively studied. After prostatectomy, the fresh whole prostate specimens were imaged in patient-specific three-dimensionally printed molds by using 3-T MRI with DR-CSI and were then sliced to create coregistered WMHP slides. The DR-CSI spectral signal component fractions (fA, fB, fC) were compared with epithelial, stromal, and luminal area fractions (fepithelium, fstroma, flumen) quantified in PCa and benign tissue regions. A linear mixed-effects model assessed the correlations between (fA, fB, fC) and (fepithelium, fstroma, flumen), and the strength of correlations was evaluated by using Spearman correlation coefficients. Differences between PCa and benign tissues in terms of DR-CSI signal components and microscopic tissue compartments were assessed using two-sided t tests. Results Prostate specimens from nine men (mean age, 65 years ± 7 [standard deviation]) were evaluated; 20 regions from 17 PCas, along with 20 benign tissue regions of interest, were analyzed. Three DR-CSI spectral signal components (spectral peaks) were consistently identified. The fA, fB, and fC were correlated with fepithelium, fstroma, and flumen (all P < .001), with Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.74 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62, 0.83), 0.80 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.89), and 0.67 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.81), respectively. PCa exhibited differences compared with benign tissues in terms of increased fA (PCa vs benign, 0.37 ± 0.05 vs 0.27 ± 0.06; P < .001), decreased fC (PCa vs benign, 0.18 ± 0.06 vs 0.31 ± 0.13; P = .01), increased fepithelium (PCa vs benign, 0.44 ± 0.13 vs 0.26 ± 0.16; P < .001), and decreased flumen (PCa vs benign, 0.14 ± 0.08 vs 0.27 ± 0.18; P = .004).

Western blot and Q-PCR were conducted to detect the protein and mRNA expressions respectively. The cell proliferation was tested by CCK8 assay. The effects of STEAP1 on the metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of LUAD were evaluated by EdU assay, wound healing assay, and transwell migratory assay. H1650, H358, HCC827, H1299, H23, A549, H1693 were selected as human LUAD cell lines in the study. Results have shown that STEAP1 expression was up-regulated in LUAD cells compared with normal lung epithelial cells. Knockdowning of STEAP1 suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of LUAD epithelial cells. Importantly, after comparing the proliferation, migration, and invasion of LUAD to the corresponding control groups treated in STAT3 inhibitor ADZ1480, we found that STEAP1 regulates EMT via Janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) signaling pathway.

Radiation therapy (RT), a common treatment for men with prostate cancer, induces cell damage through the generation of free radicals and oxidative stress. We hypothesized that disruption in cellular responses to this surge of nonphysiological oxidative stress might contribute to CRF in men with prostate cancer treated with RT. We evaluated the potential role of three cell damage pathways (apoptosis, autophagy, necrosis) and oxidative stress in CRF in men with prostate cancer receiving RT. Fatigue was measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue (FACT-F) questionnaire. Gene expression was measured in whole blood using RT2 profiler™ PCR arrays. Data were collected at two time points: either baseline or Day 1 of treatment (T1) and completion of treatment (T2). Participants were grouped into either the fatigued or nonfatigued phenotype at T2 using the recommended FACT-F cut-off score for clinical significance. We observed significant upregulation of seven genes related to three cell damage pathways in the fatigued group from T1 to T2 and no significant changes in the nonfatigued group. We also observed significant downregulation of two genes related to oxidative stress in the fatigued group compared to the nonfatigued group at T2.

East Asian-specific missense variants were identified as candidate causal variants for three novel loci, and we successfully replicated two of them by analyzing independent Japanese cohorts; p.R220W of ATG16L2 (associated with coronary artery disease) and p.V326A of POT1 (associated with lung cancer). We further investigated enrichment of heritability within 2,868 annotations of genome-wide transcription factor occupancy, and identified 378 significant enrichments across nine diseases (false discovery rate < 0.05) (for example, NKX3-1 for prostate cancer). This large-scale GWAS in a Japanese population provides insights into the etiology of complex diseases and highlights the importance of performing GWAS in non-European populations.""","""['Kazuyoshi Ishigaki', 'Masato Akiyama', 'Masahiro Kanai', 'Atsushi Takahashi', 'Eiryo Kawakami', 'Hiroki Sugishita', 'Saori Sakaue', 'Nana Matoba', 'Siew-Kee Low', 'Yukinori Okada', 'Chikashi Terao', 'Tiffany Amariuta', 'Steven Gazal', 'Yuta Kochi', 'Momoko Horikoshi', 'Ken Suzuki', 'Kaoru Ito', 'Satoshi Koyama', 'Kouichi Ozaki', 'Shumpei Niida', 'Yasushi Sakata', 'Yasuhiko Sakata', 'Takashi Kohno', 'Kouya Shiraishi', 'Yukihide Momozawa', 'Makoto Hirata', 'Koichi Matsuda', 'Masashi Ikeda', 'Nakao Iwata', 'Shiro Ikegawa', 'Ikuyo Kou', 'Toshihiro Tanaka', 'Hidewaki Nakagawa', 'Akari Suzuki', 'Tomomitsu Hirota', 'Mayumi Tamari', 'Kazuaki Chayama', 'Daiki Miki', 'Masaki Mori', 'Satoshi Nagayama', 'Yataro Daigo', 'Yoshio Miki', 'Toyomasa Katagiri', 'Osamu Ogawa', 'Wataru Obara', 'Hidemi Ito', 'Teruhiko Yoshida', 'Issei Imoto', 'Takashi Takahashi', 'Chizu Tanikawa', 'Takao Suzuki', 'Nobuaki Sinozaki', 'Shiro Minami', 'Hiroki Yamaguchi', 'Satoshi Asai', 'Yasuo Takahashi', 'Ken Yamaji', 'Kazuhisa Takahashi', 'Tomoaki Fujioka', 'Ryo Takata', 'Hideki Yanai', 'Akihide Masumoto', 'Yukihiro Koretsune', 'Hiromu Kutsumi', 'Masahiko Higashiyama', 'Shigeo Murayama', 'Naoko Minegishi', 'Kichiya Suzuki', 'Kozo Tanno', 'Atsushi Shimizu', 'Taiki Yamaji', 'Motoki Iwasaki', 'Norie Sawada', 'Hirokazu Uemura', 'Keitaro Tanaka', 'Mariko Naito', 'Makoto Sasaki', 'Kenji Wakai', 'Shoichiro Tsugane', 'Masayuki Yamamoto', 'Kazuhiko Yamamoto', 'Yoshinori Murakami', 'Yusuke Nakamura', 'Soumya Raychaudhuri#', 'Johji Inazawa#', 'Toshimasa Yamauchi#', 'Takashi Kadowaki#', 'Michiaki Kubo#', 'Yoichiro Kamatani#']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Nat Genet""","""['A genome-wide association study identifies two novel susceptibility loci and trans population polygenicity associated with bipolar disorder.', '12 new susceptibility loci for prostate cancer identified by genome-wide association study in Japanese population.', 'Genetic associations of breast and prostate cancer are enriched for regulatory elements identified in disease-related tissues.', 'Multitrait genome association analysis identifies new susceptibility genes for human anthropometric variation in the GCAT cohort.', 'Genome-wide association study of lung adenocarcinoma in East Asia and comparison with a European population.', 'Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma: a Mendelian randomization and mediation analysis.', 'The relationship between the serum lipid profile and hepatocellular carcinoma in east Asian population: A mendelian randomization study.', 'Characterizing the polygenic architecture of complex traits in populations of East Asian and European descent.', 'Genetic insights into ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament of the spine.', 'Polygenic Risk Score, Lifestyles, and Type 2 Diabetes Risk: A Prospective Chinese Cohort Study.']"""

In the absence of consensus among clinicians, patients may seek information online, where consumer-targeted content has proliferated in recent years. Our objective was to assess the content and quality of online information about prostate artery embolization (PAE).  Methods:   We evaluated patient interest and exposure to PAE by searching Google Trends for PAE and searching Google for BPH and treatment-related terms. To assess online content about PAE safety and efficacy, we queried Google for patient-oriented websites and YouTube for consumer videos, assessing quality using the validated DISCERN instrument and performing an evidence-based content analysis of how indications, risks, and benefits of PAE were presented.  Results:   Worldwide searches for PAE peaked in 2019; PAE was mentioned in 15 (26%) of the 57 general BPH-related websites. From our PAE-specific searches, we identified 50 websites and 31 videos. Academic hospitals were the most common sponsor of both PAE-related websites (16, 32%) and videos (15, 48%). Among sources offering PAE to patients, only 15% of websites and 11% of videos explicitly did so as part of a clinical trial. The average DISCERN rating of quality of content was 3.0 out of 5 for websites and 2.0 out of 5 for videos (p < 0.001). Over a quarter of websites and more than half of videos contained potential misinformation, inaccuracies, or non-evidence-based claims about PAE (p = 0.02).  Conclusions:   Online consumer information about PAE is of low to moderate quality, with a high frequency of non-evidence-based claims. In the absence of guideline consensus about the role of PAE, clinicians should offer shared decision making and evidence-based counseling about the risks and benefits of PAE.""","""['Mitchell M Huang', 'Jared S Winoker', 'Brian R Matlaga', 'Mohamad E Allaf', 'Kevin Koo']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Efficacy and safety of prostate artery embolization for benign prostatic hyperplasia: an observational study and propensity-matched comparison with transurethral resection of the prostate (the UK-ROPE study).', 'Randomised Clinical Trial of Prostatic Artery Embolisation Versus a Sham Procedure for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.', 'The STREAM Trial (Prostatic Artery Embolization for the Treatment of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) 24-Month Clinical and Radiological Outcomes.', 'Prostatic artery embolization for benign prostatic obstruction: assessment of safety and efficacy.', 'Prostatic Artery Embolization (PAE) for Symptomatic Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH): Part 2, Insights into the Technical Rationale.', 'Ejaculation physiology and dysfunction after BPH surgery: the role of the new MISTs.', 'Regenerative therapies for erectile dysfunction: the influence of direct-to-consumer marketing on patient interest.']"""

Methods:   Cohort analysis using the national US Veterans Affairs Informatics and Computing Infrastructure. We identified 69,984 patients with localized prostate cancer diagnosed from 2001 to 2015 treated with surgery or radiation. We coded receipt of TT after treatment as a time-dependent covariate; used the National Death Index to identify cause of death; and defined biochemical recurrence as PSA > 0.2 ng/mL after surgery and nadir + 2 ng/mL after radiation. We analyzed recurrence and mortality using cumulative incidence curves, Fine-Gray competing risk regression, and Cox regression.  Results:   This cohort included 28,651 surgery patients and 41,333 radiation patients, of whom 469 (1.64%) and 543 (1.31%), respectively, received TT with a median follow-up of 6.95 years.

To better understand the mechanism behind the acquisition of resistance, we conducted single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of docetaxel-sensitive and -resistant variants of DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cell lines. Overall, sensitive and resistant cells clustered separately. Differential gene expression analysis between resistant and sensitive cells revealed 182 differentially expressed genes common to both prostate cancer cell lines. A subset of these genes gave a gene expression profile in the resistant transcriptome-like-sensitive cells similar to the resistant cells. Exploration for functional gene pathways identified 218 common pathways between the two cell lines. Protein ubiquitination was the most differentially regulated pathway and was enriched in the resistant cells. Transcriptional regulator analysis identified 321 potential regulators across both cell lines. One of the top regulators identified was nuclear protein 1 (NUPR1). In contrast to the single-cell analysis, bulk analysis of the cells did not reveal NUPR1 as a promising candidate. Knockdown and overexpression of NUPR1 in the prostate cancer cells demonstrated that NUPR1 confers docetaxel resistance in both cell lines. Collectively, these data demonstrate the utility of scRNA-seq to identify regulators of drug resistance. Furthermore, NUPR1 was identified as a mediator of prostate cancer drug resistance, which provides the rationale to explore NUPR1 and its target genes for reversal of docetaxel resistance. IMPLICATIONS: Using single-cell sequencing of prostate cancer, we show that NUPR1 plays a role in docetaxel resistance.""","""['Patricia M Schnepp#', 'Greg Shelley#', 'Jinlu Dai', 'Nicole Wakim', 'Hui Jiang', 'Atsushi Mizokami', 'Evan T Keller']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Transcription factor network analysis based on single cell RNA-seq identifies that Trichostatin-a reverses docetaxel resistance in prostate Cancer.', 'Cdc20/p55 mediates the resistance to docetaxel in castration-resistant prostate cancer in a Bim-dependent manner.', 'NUPR1, a new target in liver cancer: implication in controlling cell growth, migration, invasion and sorafenib resistance.', 'Nuclear protein 1 imparts oncogenic potential and chemotherapeutic resistance in cancer.', 'NUPR1 and its potential role in cancer and pathological conditions (Review).', 'Nuclear Protein 1 Expression Is Associated with PPARG in Bladder Transitional Cell Carcinoma.', 'Integration of Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing and Network Analysis to Investigate Mechanisms of Drug Resistance.', 'Computational drug discovery for castration-resistant prostate cancers through in vitro drug response modeling.', 'Integrated analysis of single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing identifies a signature based on macrophage marker genes involved in prostate cancer prognosis and treatment responsiveness.', 'Trends and Potential of Machine Learning and Deep Learning in Drug Study at Single-Cell Level.']"""

This vaccine was evaluated in a multicenter phase I trial.  Patients and methods:   Patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) who had recently begun androgen deprivation therapy were randomly assigned to receive pTVG-AR on one of two treatment schedules over one year, and with or without GM-CSF as a vaccine adjuvant. Patients were followed for 18 months. Primary objectives were safety and immune response. Secondary objectives included median time to PSA progression, and 18-month PSA-PFS (PPFS).  Results:   Forty patients were enrolled at three centers. Twenty-seven patients completed treatment and 18 months of follow-up. Eleven patients (28%) had a PSA progression event before the 18-month time point. No grade 3 or 4 adverse events were observed. Of 30 patients with samples available for immune analysis, 14 (47%) developed Th1-type immunity to the AR LBD, as determined by IFNγ and/or granzyme B ELISPOT. Persistent IFNγ immune responses were observed irrespective of GM-CSF adjuvant. Patients who developed T-cell immunity had a significantly prolonged PPFS compared with patients without immunity (HR = 0.01; 95% CI, 0.0-0.21; P = 0.003).  Conclusions:   pTVG-AR was safe and immunologically active in patients with mCSPC.

Due to the increased use of imaging methods, they are diagnosed more frequently, especially in asymptomatic patients. SBRT has emerged as a new, alternative treatment option in the field of radiation oncology. In the past, it was often used for treating inoperable lung, liver, prostate, and brain tumors. Meanwhile, it is also an established keystone in the treatment of oligometastatic diseases. This retrospective study aims to evaluate the effect of low-dose SBRT in patients with adrenal metastases.  Methods:   We analyzed a group of 31 patients with 34 adrenal gland lesions treated with low-dose SBRT between July 2006 and July 2019. Treatment-planning was performed through contrast-enhanced CT, followed by image-guided stereotactic radiotherapy using cone-beam CT. The applied cumulative median dose was 35 Gy; the median single dose was 7 Gy. We focused on local control (LC), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), as well as acute and late toxicity.  Results:   Seven adrenal gland metastases (20.6%) experienced local failure, 80.6% of the patients faced a distant progression. Fourteen patients were still alive. Median follow-up for all patients was 9.8 months and for patients alive 14.4 months. No treatment-related side-effects >grade 2 occurred. Of all, 48.4% suffered from acute gastrointestinal disorders; 32.3% reported acute fatigue, throbbing pain in the renal area, and mild adrenal insufficiency. Altogether, 19.4% of the patients faced late-toxicities, which were as follows: Grade 1: 12.9% gastrointestinal disorders, 3.2% fatigue, Grade 2: 9.7% fatigue, 6.5% headache, 3.2% loss of weight. The 1-year OS and probability of LF were 64 and 25.9%, respectively.  Conclusion:   Low-dose SBRT has proven as an effective and safe method with promising outcomes for treating adrenal metastases. There appeared no high-grade toxicities >grade 2, and 79.4% of treated metastases were progression-free. Thus, SBRT should be considered as a therapy option for adrenal metastases as an individual therapeutic concept in the interdisciplinary discussion as an alternative to surgical or systemic treatment.""","""['Theresa Voglhuber', 'Kerstin A Kessel', 'Markus Oechsner', 'Marco M E Vogel', 'Jürgen E Gschwend', 'Stephanie E Combs']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for adrenal metastases of oligometastatic or oligoprogressive tumor patients.', 'Stereotactic body radiotherapy for adrenal oligometastasis in lung cancer patients.', 'Stereotactic body radiation therapy for adrenal gland metastases: outcome and predictive factors from a multicenter analysis.', 'Radiation Therapy in the Management of Adrenal Metastases.', 'Stereotactic body radiation therapy for adrenal metastases: a retrospective review of a noninvasive therapeutic strategy.', 'Radiation of bilateral adrenal metastases is associated with a high risk of primary adrenal insufficiency.', 'Two-institution results of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) for treating adrenal gland metastases from liver cancer.', 'Planning issues on linac-based stereotactic radiotherapy.', 'International consensus on radiotherapy in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Stereotactic radiotherapy for adrenal oligometastases.']"""

It develops mainly via NE transdifferentiation of prostate adenocarcinoma in response to androgen receptor (AR)-inhibition therapy. The study of NEPC development has been hampered by a lack of clinically relevant models. We previously established a unique and first-in-field patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of adenocarcinoma (LTL331)-to-NEPC (LTL331R) transdifferentiation. In this study, we applied conditional reprogramming (CR) culture to establish a LTL331 PDX-derived cancer cell line named LTL331_CR_Cell. These cells retain the same genomic mutations as the LTL331 parental tumor. They can be continuously propagated in vitro and can be genetically manipulated. Androgen deprivation treatment on LTL331_CR_Cells had no effect on cell proliferation. Transcriptomic analyses comparing the LTL331_CR_Cell to its parental tumor revealed a profound downregulation of the androgen response pathway and an upregulation of stem and basal cell marker genes. The transcriptome of LTL331_CR_Cells partially resembles that of post-castrated LTL331 xenografts in mice. Notably, when grafted under the renal capsules of male NOD/SCID mice, LTL331_CR_Cells spontaneously gave rise to NEPC tumors. This is evidenced by the histological expression of the NE marker CD56 and the loss of adenocarcinoma markers such as PSA. Transcriptomic analyses of the newly developed NEPC tumors further demonstrate marked enrichment of NEPC signature genes and loss of AR signaling genes. This study provides a novel research tool derived from a unique PDX model. It allows for the investigation of mechanisms underlying NEPC development by enabling gene manipulations ex vivo and subsequent functional evaluations in vivo.""","""['Xinpei Ci', 'Jun Hao', 'Xin Dong', 'Hui Xue', 'Rebecca Wu', 'Stephen Yiu Chuen Choi', 'Anne M Haegert', 'Colin C Collins', 'Xuefeng Liu', 'Dong Lin', 'Yuzhuo Wang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cells""","""['The long noncoding RNA landscape of neuroendocrine prostate cancer and its clinical implications.', 'Heterochromatin Protein 1α Mediates Development and Aggressiveness of Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'Identification of DEK as a potential therapeutic target for neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Preclinical Models of Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'Molecular events in neuroendocrine prostate cancer development.', '3D Tumor Models in Urology.', 'The future of patient-derived xenografts in prostate cancer research.', 'Understanding and targeting prostate cancer cell heterogeneity and plasticity.', 'The MURAL collection of prostate cancer patient-derived xenografts enables discovery through preclinical models of uro-oncology.', 'Preclinical Models in Prostate Cancer: Resistance to AR Targeting Therapies in Prostate Cancer.']"""

The molecular mechanisms associated with Cd-induced prostate cancer (PCa) remain elusive.  Materials and methods:   RWPE1, PWR1E and DU 145 cells were used. RT2 Profiler Array, real-time-quantitative-PCR, immunofluorescence, cell cycle, apoptosis, proliferation and colony formation assays along with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) were performed.  Result:   Chronic Cd exposure of non-malignant RWPE1 and PWR1E cells promoted cell survival, proliferation and colony formation with inhibition of apoptosis. Even a two-week Cd exposure of PCa cell line (DU 145) significantly increased the proliferation and decreased apoptosis. RT2 profiler array of 84 genes involved in the Erk/MAPK pathway revealed induction of gene expression in Cd-RWPE1 cells compared to RWPE1. This was confirmed by individual TaqMan gene expression analysis in both Cd-RWPE1 and Cd-PWR1E cell lines. GSEA showed an enrichment of the Erk/MAPK pathway along with other pathways such as KEGG-ERBB, KEGG-Cell Cycle, KEGG-VEGF, KEGG-Pathways in cancer and KEGG-prostate cancer pathway. We randomly selected upregulated genes from Erk/MAPK pathway and performed profile analysis in a PCa data set from the TCGA/GDC data base. We observed upregulation of these genes in PCa compared to normal samples. An increase in phosphorylation of the Erk1/2 and Mek1/2 was observed in Cd-RWPE1 and Cd-PWR1E cells compared to parental cells, confirming that Cd-exposure induces activation of the Erk/MAPK pathway.

We evaluate the difference in odds of presenting with metastatic disease in minorities compared to white patients despite access to the same insurance across three common cancer types.  Methods:   Using the National Cancer Database, a multilevel logistic regression model that estimated the odds of metastatic disease was fit, adjusting for covariates including year of diagnosis, ethnicity, insurance, income, and region. We included adults diagnosed with metastatic prostate, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and breast cancer from 2004 to 2015.  Results:   The study cohort consisted of 1 191 241 prostate cancer (PCa), 1 310 986 breast cancer (BCa), and 1 183 029 NSCLC patients. Private insurance was the most protective factor against metastatic presentation. Odds of presenting with metastatic disease were 0.190 [95% CI, 0.182-0.198], 0.616 [95% CI, 0.602-0.630], and 0.270 [95% CI, 0.260-0.279] for PCa, NSCLC, and BCa compared to uninsured patients, respectively.

Methods:   SBP1 levels were altered in prostate cancer cell lines and the consequences on oxygen consumption, expression of proteins associated with energy metabolism, and cellular transformation and migration were investigated. The effects of exposing cells to the SBP1 reaction products, H2 O2 and H2 S were also assessed. In silico analyses identified potential HNF4α binding sites within the SBP1 promoter region and this was investigated using an inhibitor specific for that transcription factor.  Results:   Using in silico analyses, it was determined that the promoter region of SBP1 contains putative binding sites for the HNF4α transcription factor. The potential for HNF4α to regulate SBP1 expression was supported by data indicating that HNF4α inhibition resulted in a dose-response increase in the levels of SBP1 messenger RNA and protein, identifying HNF4α as a novel negative regulator of SBP1 expression in prostate cancer cells. The consequences of altering the levels of SBP1 were investigated by ectopically expressing SBP1 in PC-3 prostate cancer cells, where SBP1 expression attenuated anchorage-independent cellular growth and migration in culture, both properties associated with transformation. SBP1 overexpression reduced oxygen consumption in these cells and increased the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a major regulator of energy homeostasis. In addition, the reaction products of SBP1, H2 O2 , and H2 S also activated AMPK.  Conclusions:   Based on the obtained data, it is hypothesized that SBP1 negatively regulates oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in the healthy prostate cells by the production of H2 O2 and H2 S and consequential activation of AMPK. The reduction of SBP1 levels in prostate cancer can occur due to increased binding of HNF4α, acting as a transcriptional inhibitor to the SBP1 promoter. Consequently, there is a reduction in H2 O2 and H2 S-mediated signaling, inhibition of AMPK, and stimulation of OXPHOS and building blocks of biomolecules needed for tumor growth and progression. Other effects of SBP1 loss in tumor cells remain to be discovered.""","""['Mostafa Elhodaky', 'Lenny K Hong', 'Shrinidhi Kadkol', 'Alan M Diamond']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Evidence that selenium binding protein 1 is a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer.', 'Selenium-Binding Protein 1 in Human Health and Disease.', 'DNA Methylation of miR-122 Aggravates Oxidative Stress in Colitis Targeting SELENBP1 Partially by p65NF-κB Signaling.', 'Functional and physical interaction between the selenium-binding protein 1 (SBP1) and the glutathione peroxidase 1 selenoprotein.', 'Role of SELENBP1 and SELENOF in prostate cancer bioenergetics.', 'The role of SELENBP1 and its epigenetic regulation in carcinogenic progression.', 'Metabolism and Anticancer Mechanisms of Selocompounds: Comprehensive Review.', 'Tumor microenvironment-related gene selenium-binding protein 1 (SELENBP1) is associated with immunotherapy efficacy and survival in colorectal cancer.', 'The role of hepatocyte nuclear factor\u20094α\u2009(HNF4α)\u2009in\u2009tumorigenesis.', 'Using bioinformatics approaches to identify survival-related oncomiRs as potential targets of miRNA-based treatments for lung adenocarcinoma.']"""

Objective:   To examine primary care clinicians' decision-making on stopping breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer screening in older adults with limited life expectancy.  Design, setting, and participants:   In qualitative interviews coupled with medical record-stimulated recall, clinicians from 17 academic and community clinics affiliated with a large health system were asked how they came to specific cancer screening decisions in 2 or 3 of their older patients with less than 10-year of estimated life expectancy, including patients with and without recent screening. Patients were surveyed by telephone. Data collection occurred between October 2018 and May 2019.  Main outcomes and measures:   Clinician interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were analyzed with qualitative content analysis to identify major themes. Patient surveys assessed perception of cancer screening decisions, importance of clinician recommendation, and willingness to stop screening.  Results:   Twenty-five primary care clinicians (mean [SD] age, 47.1 [9.7] years; 14 female [56%]) discussed 53 patients during medical record-stimulated recall, ranging from 2 to 3 patients per clinician; 46 patients and 1 caregiver (mean [SD] age 74.9 [5.4]; 31 female [66%]) participated in the survey. Clinician interviews revealed 5 major themes: (1) cancer screening decisions were not always conscious, deliberate decisions; (2) electronic medical record alerts were connected with less deliberate decision-making; (3) cancer screening was not binary and clinicians often considered other options to scale back screening without actually stopping; (4) in addition to patient characteristics, clinicians were influenced by patient request and anecdotal experiences; and (5) influences outside of the primary care clinician-patient dyad were important, such as from specialists and patients' family or friends. Patient surveys asked approximately 64 cancer screening decisions of 47 patients. Patients did not recall approximately half (31 of 64) of their cancer screening decisions. Among those with recent screening, the mean score for willingness to stop screening was 3.2 (95% CI 2.5-3.9) on a 5-point Likert scale (with 1 indicating ""extremely unlikely"" and 5 indicating ""extremely likely""). In most screening decisions that involved specialists (13 of 16), patients valued specialists' recommendations over those of primary care clinicians.  Conclusions and relevance:   Cancer screening decision-making is complex.

Our research uses The Cancer Gene Atlas (TCGA) database to find potential related genes for predicting the prognosis of patients with PRAD.  Methods:   We downloaded gene expression profiles and clinical sample information from TCGA for 490 patients with PRAD (patient age: 41-78 years). We calculated stromal and immune scores using the ESTIMATE algorithm to predict the level of stromal and immune cell infiltration. We categorized patients with PRAD in TCGA into high and low score arrays according to their median immune/stromal scores and identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were significantly correlated with the prognosis of PRAD. Then, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed. The association between DEGs and overall survival was investigated by weighted Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and multivariate analysis. Furthermore, the protein-protein interaction network (PPI) of DEGs was constructed using the STRING tool. Finally, the hub genes were identified by analyzing the degree of association of PPI networks.  Results:   We found that 8 individual DEGs, C6, S100A12, MLC1, PAX5, C7, FAM162B, CAMK1G, and TCEAL5, were significantly predictive of favorable overall survival and one DEG, EPYC, was associated with poor overall survival. GO and KEGG pathway analyses revealed that the DEGs were associated with immune responses. Moreover, 30 hub genes were obtained using the PPI network of DEGs: ITGAM, CD4, CD3E, IL-10, LCP2, ITGB2, ZAP-70, C3, CCL19, CXCL13, CXCL9, BTK, CCL21, CD247, CD28, CD3D, FCER1G, PTPRC, TYROBP, CCR5, ITK, CCL13, CCR1, CCR2, CD79B, CYBB, IL2RG, JAK3, PLCG2, and CD19. These prominent nodes had the most associations with other genes, indicating that they might play crucial roles in the prognosis of PRAD.

In the univariate analysis, the prevalence of anti-HCV positivity did not differ significantly between the controls and the cases with cancers of the renal pelvis and ureter (8% v9%, P = .81), prostate (10% v8%, P = .34), or urinary bladder (8% v 6%, P = .18). In contrast, the prevalence of anti-HCV positivity was lower among the cases with kidney cancer than among the controls (4% v 8%, P< .001). However, in the multivariate analyses after adjustment for cofounders, no significant association between anti-HCV positivity and any genitourinary cancer we evaluated.

In the current study, we aimed to investigate two strong epigenetic predictors for life span, derived from blood DNA methylation data, in tissue samples of solid cancer patients. Using data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the German DACHS study, we compared a mortality risk score (MRscore) and DNAmPhenoAge in paired tumor and adjacent normal tissue samples of patients with lung (N = 69), colorectal (n = 299), breast (n = 90), head/neck (n = 50), prostate (n = 50), and liver (n = 50) cancer. To explore the concordance across tissue and blood, we additionally assessed the two markers in blood samples of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases and matched controls (n = 93) in the DACHS+ study. The MRscore was significantly elevated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues of all cancers except prostate cancer, for which an opposite pattern was observed. DNAmPhenoAge was consistently higher in all tumor tissues. The MRscore discriminated lung, colorectal, and prostate tumor tissues from normal tissues with very high accuracy [AUCs of 0.87, 0.99 (TCGA) /0.94 (DACHS), and 0.92, respectively]. DNAmPhenoAge accurately discriminated five types of tumor tissues from normal tissues (except prostate cancer), with AUCs of 0.82-0.93. The MRscore was also significantly higher in blood samples of CRC cases than in controls, with areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.74, whereas DNAmPhenoAge did not distinguish cases from controls, with AUC of 0.54. This study provides compelling evidence that blood-derived DNAm markers could reflect methylation changes in less accessible tissues.

To achieve the goal of rapid and label-free cell classification, realistic optical cell models (OCMs) have been developed for simulation of diffraction imaging by single cells. A total of 1892 OCMs were obtained with varied nuclear volumes and orientations to calculate cross-polarized diffraction image (p-DI) pairs divided into three nuclear size groups of OCMS , OCMO and OCML based on three prostate cell structures. Binary classifications were conducted among the three groups with image parameters extracted by the algorithm of gray-level co-occurrence matrix. The averaged accuracy of support vector machine (SVM) classifier on test dataset of p-DI was found to be 98.8% and 97.5% respectively for binary classifications of OCMS vs OCMO and OCMO vs OCML for the prostate cancer cell structure. The values remain about the same at 98.9% and 97.8% for the smaller prostate normal cell structures.

Estrogens are pro-inflammatory while androgens are anti-inflammatory. Thus, we investigated whether serum sex steroid hormone concentrations are associated with intraprostatic inflammation to inform mechanistic links among hormones, inflammation, and prostate cancer.  Methods:   We conducted a cross-sectional study among 247 men in the placebo arm of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial who had a negative end-of-study biopsy, most (92.7%) performed without clinical indication per trial protocol. Serum estradiol, estrone, and testosterone were previously measured by immunoassay in pooled baseline and Year 3 serum. Free estradiol and free testosterone were calculated. Inflammation was visually assessed (median of three prostate biopsy cores per man). Polytomous or logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of some or all cores inflamed (both vs none) or any core inflamed (vs none) by hormone tertile, adjusting for age, race, and family history. We evaluated effect modification by waist circumference and body mass index (BMI).  Results:   In all, 51.4% had some and 26.3% had all cores inflamed.

Although prostate-specific antigen (PSA) performs modestly, nonsecreting cancers including those with early castrate-resistance warrant investigation of other predictive biomarkers. The objectives of these studies were to develop and perform initial validation of a circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) methylation assay.  Methods:   Methylation DETection of Circulating Tumor DNA (mDETECT) is a highly multiplexed targeted sequencing DNA methylation-based ctDNA blood test that captures the vast majority of prostate cancer phenotypes due to a careful development process that ensures that each probe region is methylated in at least 50% of all methylation-based subtypes and is not methylated in normal tissues. Next-generation sequencing of targeted polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products whose amplification is biased towards methylated DNA ensures the specificity of the assay by identifying multiple tumor-specific methylated CpG residues in each read.  Results:   The final test is comprised of 46 PCR probes to 40 regions. It is relatively resistant to contaminating normal DNA and as a result functions in both serum and plasma samples. The assay was initially validated in a variety of prostate cancer cell lines to ensure specificity. Using a small number of longitudinal samples from prostate cancer patients initiating androgen deprivation therapy, the ability of mDETECT to track tumor burden was assessed compared with PSA. The mDETECT test signal generally paralleled that of PSA increasing and decreasing commensurate with tumor evolution in these patients. In two cases it appeared to anticipate clinical progression by a number of months compared to PSA and in a PSA nonproducing case, it was able to track tumor progression.  Conclusions:   mDETECT offers a promising tool for the assessment of prostate cancer burden based on the sensitive detection of prostate-specific ctDNA and requires further validation.""","""['Jacob J K Carson', 'Michael A Di Lena', 'David M Berman', 'D Robert Siemens', 'Christopher R Mueller']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Circulating Tumor DNA Abundance and Potential Utility in De Novo Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Epigenetic Analysis of Circulating Tumor DNA in Localized and Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Evaluation of Clinical Biomarker Potential.', 'Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for prostate specific antigen in the management of prostate cancer.', 'Comparative Analysis of Genomic Alterations across Castration Sensitive and Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer via Circulating Tumor DNA Sequencing.', 'Fundamentals of liquid biopsies in metastatic prostate cancer: from characterization to stratification.', 'Cell-free DNA in the management of prostate cancer: Current status and future prospective.', 'Detection of tumor-specific DNA methylation markers in the blood of patients with pituitary neuroendocrine tumors.', 'Detection and relevance of epigenetic markers on ctDNA: recent advances and future outlook.']"""

Our study aims to test the hypothesis that prostate cancer risk among night workers may be modulated by genetic polymorphisms in the circadian pathway genes based on data from the EPICAP study, a population-based case-control study including 1511 men (732 cases/779 controls) with genotyped data. We estimated odds ratio (ORs) and P values of the association between prostate cancer and circadian gene variants using logistic regression models. We tested the interaction between circadian genes variants and night work indicators that were significantly associated with prostate cancer at pathway, gene and SNP levels. Analyses were also stratified by each of these night work indicators and by cancer aggressiveness. The circadian pathway was significantly associated with aggressive prostate cancer among night workers (P = .004), particularly for men who worked at night for <20 years (P = .0002) and those who performed long night shift (>10 hours, P = .001). At the gene level, we observed among night workers significant associations between aggressive prostate cancer and ARNTL, NPAS2 and RORA. At the SNP-level, no significant association was observed.

Conclusions:   The results suggest that BPH may be associated with the development of fibrosis and gland atrophy within the peripheral zone.

Patients and methods:   Repeat prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements, timing and results of previous biopsies, and age at baseline from the world's largest AS study, Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance (PRIAS; 7813 patients, 1134 experienced upgrading). We fitted a Bayesian joint model for time-to-event and longitudinal data to this dataset. We then validated our model externally in the largest six AS cohorts of the Movember Foundation's third Global Action Plan (GAP3) database (>20 000 patients, 27 centres worldwide). Using the model predicted upgrading risks; we scheduled biopsies whenever a patient's upgrading risk was above a certain threshold. To assist patients/doctors in the choice of this threshold, and to compare the resulting personalised schedule with currently practiced schedules, along with the timing and the total number of biopsies (burden) planned, for each schedule we provided them with the time delay expected in detecting upgrading (shorter is better).  Results:   The cause-specific cumulative upgrading risk at the 5-year follow-up was 35% in PRIAS, and at most 50% in the GAP3 cohorts. In the PRIAS-based model, PSA velocity was a stronger predictor of upgrading (hazard ratio [HR] 2.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.93-2.99) than the PSA level (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.89-1.11). Our model had a moderate area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.6-0.7) in the validation cohorts. The prediction error was moderate (0.1-0.2) in theGAP3 cohorts where the impact of the PSA level and velocity on upgrading risk was similar to PRIAS, but large (0.2-0.3) otherwise. Our model required re-calibration of baseline upgrading risk in the validation cohorts. We implemented the validated models and the methodology for personalised schedules in a web-application (http://tiny.cc/biopsy).  Conclusions:   We successfully developed and validated a model for predicting upgrading risk, and providing risk-based personalised biopsy decisions in AS of prostate cancer. Personalised prostate biopsies are a novel alternative to fixed one-size-fits-all schedules, which may help to reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies, while maintaining cancer control. The model and schedules made available via a web-application enable shared decision-making on biopsy schedules by comparing fixed and personalised schedules on total biopsies and expected time delay in detecting upgrading.""","""['Anirudh Tomer', 'Daan Nieboer', 'Monique J Roobol', 'Anders Bjartell', 'Ewout W Steyerberg', 'Dimitris Rizopoulos;Movember Foundation’s Global Action Plan Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance (GAP) consortium']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: Past, Current, and Future Trends.', 'Personalized Decision Making for Biopsies in Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance Programs.', 'Predicting Biopsy Outcomes During Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: External Validation of the Canary Prostate Active Surveillance Study Risk Calculators in Five Large Active Surveillance Cohorts.', 'Compliance Rates with the Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance (PRIAS) Protocol and Disease Reclassification in Noncompliers.', 'Risk Stratification of Low-risk Prostate Cancer: Individualizing Care in the Era of Active Surveillance.', 'Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: Past, Current, and Future Trends.', 'Prospective Implementation and Early Outcomes of a Risk-stratified Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance Follow-up Protocol.', 'Development and External Validation of the STRATified CANcer Surveillance (STRATCANS) Multivariable Model for Predicting Progression in Men with Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer Starting Active Surveillance.', 'Joint models for dynamic prediction in localised prostate cancer: a literature review.', 'Risk of progression following a negative biopsy in prostate cancer active surveillance.']"""

Patients and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 142 patients following salvage radical prostatectomy (sRP), 50 of which had a 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT performed as a preoperative staging module. Predictive clinical parameters were analysed in a multivariate Cox regression analysis. Sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) and the accuracy of 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT were analysed with regard to LNM and local recurrence.  Results:   In all, 613 lymph nodes were resected in 40 patients and 23 lymph nodes had metastatic deposits in 14 patients. In all patients local recurrence could have been found with 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV and accuracy on a per lymph node basis were 34.78% (16.38-57.2%), 100% (99.38-100%), 100%, 97.52% (96.69-98.15%) and 97.55% (96.00-98.62%). For detecting local recurrence, the sensitivity and PPV were both 100% with an accuracy of 100% (92.89-100%).  Conclusion: 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT should be the standard imaging in biochemical recurrent prostate cancer.

The goal was to improve the currently applied size-based differentiation criterion in PI-RADS.  Methods and materials:   MRIs of 293 patients who had undergone 3 T MR imaging with subsequent confirmation of prostate cancer on systematic and targeted MRI/TRUS-fusion biopsy were re-read by three radiologists. All identifiable tumors were measured on T2WI for lesions originating in the transition zone (TZ) and on DWI for lesions from the peripheral zone (PZ) and tabulated against their Gleason grade.  Results:   309 lesions were analyzed, 213 (68.9 %) in the PZ and 96 (31.1 %) in the TZ. ROC-Analysis showed a stronger correlation between lesion size and clinically significant (defined as Gleason Grade Group ≥ 2) prostate cancer (PCa) for the PZ (AUC = 0.73) compared to the TZ (AUC = 0.63). The calculated Youden index resulted in size cut-offs of 14 mm for PZ and 21 mm for TZ tumors.  Conclusion:   Size cut-offs can be used to stratify prostate cancer with different optimal size thresholds in the peripheral zone and transition zone. There was a clearer separation of clinically significant tumors in peripheral zone cancers compared to transition zone cancers. Future iterations of PI-RADS could therefore take different size-based cut-offs for peripheral zone and transition zone cancers into account.""","""['Samy Mahjoub', 'Alexander D J Baur', 'Julian Lenk', 'Chau Hung Lee', 'Alexander Hartenstein', 'Madhuri M Rudolph', 'Hannes Cash', 'Bernd Hamm', 'Patrick Asbach', 'Matthias Haas', 'Tobias Penzkofer']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur J Radiol""","""['Prevalence of Prostate Cancer in PI-RADS Version 2.1 Transition Zone Atypical Nodules Upgraded by Abnormal DWI: Correlation With MRI-Directed TRUS-Guided Targeted Biopsy.', 'Evaluating the size criterion for PI-RADSv2 category 5 upgrade: is 15\xa0mm the best threshold?', 'Prospective PI-RADS v2.1 Atypical Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Nodules With Marked Restricted Diffusion: Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer on Multiparametric MRI.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'PI-RADS: what is new and how to use it.', 'Differences in the pathogenetic characteristics of prostate cancer in the transitional and peripheral zones and the possible molecular biological mechanisms.']"""

Kaplan-Meier, Cox proportional regression, and unsupervised cluster analysis were used to assess the correlation between DEAs and clinical characteristics. In total, 43 834 AS events were identified, of which 1628 AS events were differentially expressed. The parental genes of these DEAs played a significant role in the regulation of prostate cancer-related processes. In total, 226 DEAs events were found to be associated with disease-free survival. Four clusters of molecules with different survival modes were revealed by unsupervised cluster analysis of DEAs.

Nevertheless, it causes overtreatment or an unnecessary biopsy because of its limited specificity. PCa-associated ncRNA transcript 1 (PCAT1), the newly identified long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) has been reported to associate with the progress of PCa. In vitro studies proposed that PCAT-1 may be an appealing candidate for diagnostic accuracy improvement with regard to its notable overexpression in PCa cells. The present study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic potential of the plasma PCAT1 expression levels in PCa patients in comparison to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients and healthy controls.  Methods:   The plasma lncRNA PCAT1 level was measured by a real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in 40 men newly diagnosed with PCa, 20 patients with BPH and 20 healthy subjects. The results were analyzed statistically using SPSS, version 25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).  Results:   The expression of PCAT1 was significantly higher in healthy subjects compared to BPH patients (p = 0.03).

The cancer cells are retrieved within 5 min with high viability (>95%), captured efficiency (78%), and high purity (99%) from 7.5 mL of blood cell mixed samples. Furthermore, the CTCs can be isolated from prostate cancer patients' blood samples and verified in situ using cancer-specific markers within 1.5 h, demonstrating the possibility to be applied to clinical practice.

Oxidative stress results from toxic effects of ROS and plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases like cancers and many important biological processes. It is known that the unique feature of high intracellular ROS level in cancer cells can be considered as target and utilized as a useful cancer-related stimulus to mediate intracellular drug delivery. Therefore, biomaterials responsive to excess level of ROS are of great importance in biomedical applications. In this study, a novel ROS-responsive polymer based on L-methionine poly(ester amide) (Met-PEA-PEG) was designed, synthesized, characterized and self-assembled into nano-micellar-type nanoparticles (NP). The Met-PEA-PEG NP exhibited responsiveness to an oxidative environment. The size and morphology of the nanoparticle changed rapidly in the presence of H2 O2 . The Nile Red dye was loaded into the Met-PEA-PEG NP to demonstrate a H2 O2 concentration induced time-dependent release behavior. The Met-PEA-PEG NP was sensitive to high intracellular ROS level of PC3 prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, the Met-PEA-PEG NP was investigated as a carrier of a Chinese medicine-based anticancer component, gambogic acid (GA). Compared to free GA, the GA-loaded nanocomplex (GA-NP) showed enhanced cytotoxicity toward PC3 and HeLa cells. The GA-NP also induced a higher level of apoptosis and mitochondrial depolarization in PC3 cells than free GA. The Met-PEA-PEG NP improved the therapeutic effect of GA and may serve as a potential carrier for anticancer drug delivery.""","""['Qinghua Xu', 'Chih-Chang Chu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Biomed Mater Res A""","""['Folate-decorated arginine-based poly(ester urea urethane) nanoparticles as carriers for gambogic acid and effect on cancer cells.', 'Inclusion complex from cyclodextrin-grafted hyaluronic acid and pseudo protein as biodegradable nano-delivery vehicle for gambogic acid.', 'Cinnamaldehyde-Based Poly(ester-thioacetal) To Generate Reactive Oxygen Species for Fabricating Reactive Oxygen Species-Responsive Nanoparticles.', 'Tumor-targeted induction of oxystress for cancer therapy.', 'Therapeutic strategies by modulating oxygen stress in cancer and inflammation.', 'Cyclic RGD-Functionalized pH/ROS Dual-Responsive Nanoparticle for Targeted Breast Cancer Therapy.', 'Recent Advances in Nanotechnology with Nano-Phytochemicals: Molecular Mechanisms and Clinical Implications in Cancer Progression.']"""

PSMA-PET/CT (positron emission tomography/computed tomography) performed for prostate cancer has been observed to detect melanoma metastases. The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of PSMA immunohistochemistry on resected melanoma metastases to explore its use as a diagnostic imaging biomarker for melanoma.  Methods:   A total of 41 specimens with stage III/IV melanoma were stained with PSMA immunohistochemistry. All specimens required both disease and control regions. Two pathologists scored the specimens and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted. Western blot and multiplex immunofluorescence were also performed.  Results:   The area under the ROC curve was 0.82, suggesting that PSMA has excellent discriminatory power in melanoma metastases. Sensitivity is 82.9% and specificity 73.2%. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot reveal that PSMA staining in melanoma consistently and most intensely occurs in tumor neovasculature. Multiplex immunofluorescence shows that melanocytes may also weakly express PSMA.  Conclusion:   The performance of PSMA immunohistochemistry in melanoma metastases contrasts with that reported in prostate cancer studies. This study indicates that PSMA shows promise for use as a novel biomarker in melanoma and justifies further research in the clinical setting with potential as a PET/CT radiotracer and intraoperative fluorescence marker for melanoma.""","""['Hayden Snow', 'Stephen Hazell', 'Nicholas Francis', 'Kabir Mohammed', ""Stephanie O'Neill"", 'Emma Davies', 'David Mansfield', 'Christina Messiou', 'Nabil Hujairi', 'David Nicol', 'Kevin Harrington', 'Myles Smith']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Cutan Pathol""","""['68Ga-Labeled Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Ligand Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Diagnostic Performance of Radiolabeled Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography for Primary Lymph Node Staging in Newly Diagnosed Intermediate to High-Risk Prostate Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Diagnostic Accuracy of 64Copper Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography for Primary Lymph Node Staging of Intermediate- to High-risk Prostate Cancer: Our Preliminary Experience.', 'Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen PET: Clinical Utility in Prostate Cancer, Normal Patterns, Pearls, and Pitfalls.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen-guided salvage lymph node dissection in recurrent prostate cancer: a novel technology to detect lymph node metastases.', 'PSMA Expression in Solid Tumors beyond the Prostate Gland: Ready for Theranostic Applications?', 'False Positive Findings of 18FPSMA-1007 PET/CT in Patients After Radical Prostatectomy with Undetectable Serum PSA Levels.', 'Investigating Serum and Tissue Expression Identified a Cytokine/Chemokine Signature as a Highly Effective Melanoma Marker.']"""

Experimental design:   The trial prospectively included 37 patients who had an early PSA progression (≤2 ng/mL) during castration and high-risk (PSA doubling time ≤10 months) nonmetastatic disease by conventional imaging. All patients underwent both 68Ga-PSMA and 18F-FDG PET/CT. Lesions were classified into PSMA+FDG± lesions and PSMA-FDG+ lesions. The primary endpoint was the prevalence of PSMA-FDG+ disease. Tumor burden, predictors for positive imaging, and suitability for oligometastases-directed therapy (OMDT) were also evaluated.  Results:   All patients were treated with RP and the median duration of castration was 23 months. The median PSA at imaging was 0.57 ng/mL. Overall, 114 lesions were detected in 29 of the 37 patients. A high prevalence (73%) of N+/M+ disease was observed. Of the 114 lesions, 81 were PSMA+FDG± and 33 were PSMA-FDG+. Per patient level, 9 men (24%; 95% confidence interval: 10%-39%) showed at least one new PSMA-FDG+ lesions. A short PSA doubling time (P = 0.009, OR = 8.000) was associated with PSMA+FDG± disease, while a high Gleason grade group (P = 0.022, OR = 13.091) with PSMA-FDG+ disease. Nineteen patients (51%) with 51 lesions, including 10 PSMA-FDG+ lesions, could be enrolled for OMDT. Among different disease stages, PSMA-FDG+ disease was rarely detected in the hormone-sensitive cohort, but frequently found in the castration-resistant cohort.

We present a population modeling framework identifying and quantifying such relationships, based on longitudinal data collected in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) to evaluate the value of tumor size and CTC counts as predictors of OS.  Experimental design:   A pharmacometric approach (i.e., population pharmacodynamic modeling) was used to characterize the changes in tumor size and CTC count and evaluate them as predictors of OS in 451 patients with mCRC treated with chemotherapy and targeted therapy in a prospectively randomized phase III study (CAIRO2).  Results:   A tumor size model of tumor quiescence and drug resistance was used to characterize the tumor size time-course, and was, in addition to the total normalized dose (i.e., of all administered drugs) in a given cycle, related to the CTC counts through a negative binomial model (CTC model). Tumor size changes did not contribute additional predictive value when the mean CTC count was a predictor of OS. Treatment reduced the typical mean count from 1.43 to 0.477 (HR = 3.94). The modeling framework was applied to explore whether dose modifications (increased and reduced) would result in a CTC count below 1/7.5 mL after 1 to 2 weeks of treatment.  Conclusions:   Time-varying CTC counts can be useful for early predicting OS in patients with mCRC, and may therefore have potential for model-based treatment individualization. Although tumor size was connected to CTC, its link to OS was weaker.""","""['Ida Netterberg', 'Mats O Karlsson', 'Leon W M M Terstappen', 'Miriam Koopman', 'Cornelis J A Punt', 'Lena E Friberg']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Combination of circulating tumor cell enumeration and tumor marker detection in predicting prognosis and treatment effect in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Circulating tumor cells versus objective response assessment predicting survival in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with docetaxel chemotherapy.', 'Circulating Tumor Cell Enumeration in a Phase II Trial of a Four-Drug Regimen in Advanced Colorectal Cancer.', 'FOLFOX plus anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody (mAb) is an effective first-line treatment for patients with RAS-wild left-sided metastatic colorectal cancer: A meta-analysis.', 'Circulating Tumor Cells: Does Ion Transport Contribute to Intravascular Survival, Adhesion, Extravasation, and Metastatic Organotropism?', 'Circulating tumor DNA: Opportunities and challenges for pharmacometric approaches.', 'Support to early clinical decisions in drug development and personalised medicine with checkpoint inhibitors using dynamic biomarker-overall survival models.', 'Reply to Comment on ""In vivo flow cytometry reveals a circadian rhythm of circulating tumor cells"".', 'Application of Machine Learning in Translational Medicine: Current Status and Future Opportunities.', 'Small Cell Size Circulating Aneuploid Cells as a Biomarker of Prognosis in Resectable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.']"""

Objective:   To evaluate long-term benefits and risks of enzalutamide in the final prespecified PREVAIL analysis.  Design, setting, and participants:   We conducted a final 5-yr survival analysis of PREVAIL in men with chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC from the enzalutamide (n = 689) and placebo (n = 693) arms.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Predictors of the primary outcome of overall survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Long-term adverse events over time were analyzed.  Results and limitations:   At the 5-yr data cutoff, 1382 of 1717 (80%) men had died. Enzalutamide reduced the hazard of death by 17% (hazard ratio 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75-0.93; p < 0.001), despite 65%, 54%, and 43% of placebo-treated patients receiving subsequent docetaxel, abiraterone, and enzalutamide, respectively. Median overall survival was 36 mo (95% CI 34-38) in the enzalutamide arm versus 31 mo (95% CI 29-34) in the placebo arm, with a median follow-up of 69 mo. Prognostic modeling showed 5-yr survival rates of 42%, 24%, and 5% for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively. Greater degrees of confirmed prostate-specific antigen declines (≤3 mo) were associated with greater 5-yr survival. A higher incidence of fatal treatment-emergent adverse events was observed with enzalutamide (6.9% vs 3.8%), with an increase in fatal cardiovascular events (1.6% vs 0.4%).  Conclusions:   With >5 yr of follow-up, enzalutamide continued to demonstrate improved survival in patients with mCRPC despite crossover and multiple subsequent effective therapies, balanced against a slightly higher rate of fatal cardiovascular events. PREVAIL is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT01212991.

Despite a variety of upcoming digital health-tech solutions, there is little knowledge on uro-oncologic patients' perception of digital technologies in clinical care and cancer trials.  Patients and methods:   A questionnaire was developed to evaluate patients' current use, preferences, and expectations of digital health technology. Patients receiving systemic treatment for urothelial, prostate, and renal-cell carcinoma were included during outpatient visits.  Results:   Ninety-seven patients undergoing systemic therapy for metastatic renal-cell, urothelial, or prostate cancer were included in the final analysis. Internet, smartphone, and wearable user rates were significantly higher in younger patients (100% user rate in age group 40-49 years vs. 38% in age group 80-89 years). Patients were more likely to use wearables in clinical trials when they received the generated data (2.9/5) than when they did not (2.3/5, P < .0001). Interest in activity data (3.7/5) was higher than sleeping data (2.7/5, P < .0001), but desire for sleeping data increases with advancement of treatment lines (3.9, P = .008). Patients prefer a digital follow-up every 2.6 days; younger patients and those receiving advanced therapy lines prefer less frequent follow-up (respectively, every 3.3 days, P = .050, and every 4.0 days, P = .0001). Patients allow a maximum of an average of 2.2 minutes daily for digital follow-up.

The treatment types included the following: (I) LT versus non-LT (NLT) and (II) radical prostatectomy (RP) versus radiotherapy (RT).  Results:   In the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database [2004-2014], we identified 14,208 patients newly diagnosed with low PSA values (10 ng/mL or less), with a Gleason score 8-10, and cT1-4N0M0 prostate adenocarcinoma. After the first PSM, of the 3,512 PCa patients, 1,576 underwent LT and 1,576 underwent NLT. After the second PSM, of the 792 PCa patients, 396 underwent RP, and 396 underwent RT. The 5- and 10-year OS rates for LT vs. NLT patients were 90% and 73% versus 69% and 39%, respectively, while the 5- and 10-year CSS rates for LT vs. NLT patients were 98% and 94% versus 89% and 79%, respectively. Subsequent multivariate survival analysis showed that LT was associated with lower likelihood of PCa mortality relative to NLT [hazard ratio (HR), 0.19; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.14-0.26, P<0.001], also in RP versus RT (HR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.12-0.54, P<0.001).  Conclusions:   In patients with low PSA values, Gleason score 8-10, and localized PCa, LT resulted in higher survival compared with NLT. Within LT, RP provided the most benefit relative to RT.""","""['Shuai Liu', 'Xiao-Ying Wang', 'Tian-Bao Huang', 'Quan Niu', 'Kai Yao', 'Xing Song', 'Shi-Yao Zhou', 'Zhen Chen', 'Guang-Chen Zhou']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Ann Palliat Med""","""['Local Therapy Improves Survival in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Elderly patients aged ≥\u200975\xa0years with locally advanced prostate cancer may benefit from local treatment: a population-based propensity score-adjusted analysis.', 'Overall survival and cancer-specific survival were improved in local treatment of metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'An Updated Systematic and Comprehensive Review of Cytoreductive Prostatectomy for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.']"""

A drawback of the 99mTc-tricarbonyl core is its lipophilicity, which can influence the pharmacokinetic properties of the SPECT imaging probe. Addition of polar pharmacological modifiers to 99mTc-tricarbonyl conjugates holds the promise to counteract this effect and provide tumor-targeting radiopharmaceuticals with improved hydrophilicities, e.g., resulting in a favorable fast renal excretion in vivo. We applied the ""Click-to-Chelate"" strategy for the assembly of a novel 99mTc-tricarbonyl labeled conjugate made of the tumor-targeting, modified bombesin binding sequence [Nle14]BBN(7-14) and the carbohydrate sorbitol as a polar modifier. The 99mTc-radiopeptide was evaluated in vitro with PC-3 cells and in Fox-1nu mice bearing PC-3 xenografts including a direct comparison with a reference conjugate lacking the sorbitol moiety. The glycated 99mTc-tricarbonyl peptide conjugate exhibited an increased hydrophilicity as well as a retained affinity toward the Gastrin releasing peptide receptor and cell internalization properties. However, there was no significant difference in vivo in terms of pharmacokinetic properties. In particular, the rate and route of excretion was unaltered in comparison to the more lipophilic reference compound. This could be attributed to the intrinsic properties of the peptide and/or its metabolites.

There is, however, limited knowledge in how criteria verifying [Formula: see text] work for patients newly diagnosed with cancer. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of fulfillment of typical criteria verifying [Formula: see text] and to investigate the associations between the criteria and the test leader's evaluation whether a test was performed ""to exhaustion"". An additional aim was to establish new cut-points within the associated criteria.  Methods:   From the Phys-Can randomized controlled trial, 535 patients (59 ±12 years) newly diagnosed with breast (79%), prostate (17%) or colorectal cancer (4%) performed an incremental [Formula: see text] test on a treadmill. The test was performed before starting (neo-)adjuvant treatment and an exercise intervention. Fulfillment of different cut-points within typical criteria verifying [Formula: see text] was described. The dependent key variables included in the initial bivariate analysis were achievement of a [Formula: see text] plateau, peak values for maximal heart rate, respiratory exchange ratio (RER), the patients' rating of perceived exertion on Borg's scale6-20 and peak breathing frequency (fR). A receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to establish cut-points for variables associated with the test leader's evaluation. Last, a cross-validation of the cut-points found in the receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed on a comparable sample of cancer patients (n = 80).  Results:   The criteria RERpeak (<0.001), Borg's RPE (<0.001) and fR peak (p = 0.018) were associated with the test leader's evaluation of whether a test was defined as ""to exhaustion"". The cut-points that best predicted the test leader's evaluation were RER ≥ 1.14, RPE ≥ 18 and fR ≥ 40. Maximal heart rate and [Formula: see text] plateau was not associated with the test leader's evaluation.  Conclusion:   We recommend a focus on RER (in the range between ≥1.1 and ≥1.15) and RPE (≥17 or ≥18) in addition to the test leader's evaluation. Additionally, a fR peak of ≥40 breaths/min may be a cut-point to help the test leader evaluate the degree of exhaustion. However, more research is needed to verify our findings, and to investigate how these criteria will work within a population that are undergoing or finished with cancer treatment.""","""['Ann Christin Helgesen Bjørke', 'Truls Raastad', 'Sveinung Berntsen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Treadmill running using an RPE-clamp model: mediators of perception and implications for exercise prescription.', 'Submaximal, Perceptually Regulated Exercise Testing Predicts Maximal Oxygen Uptake: A Meta-Analysis Study.', 'A perceptually regulated, graded exercise test predicts peak oxygen uptake during treadmill exercise in active and sedentary participants.', 'Overall and differentiated sensory responses to cardiopulmonary exercise test in patients with cystic fibrosis: kinetics and ability to predict peak oxygen uptake.', 'The Oxygen Uptake Plateau-A Critical Review of the Frequently Misunderstood Phenomenon.', 'Exploring Moderators of the Effect of High vs. Low-to-Moderate Intensity Exercise on Cardiorespiratory Fitness During Breast Cancer Treatment - Analyses of a Subsample From the Phys-Can RCT.', 'Inter-observer agreement of preoperative cardiopulmonary exercise test interpretation in major abdominal surgery.', 'Comparison of time-matched aerobic, resistance or combined exercise training in women living with obesity: a protocol for a pilot randomised controlled trial-the EXOFFIT (Exercise for Obesity in Females to increase Fitness) study.', 'Factors and Prognostic Significance of Impaired Exercise Tolerance in Women over 40 with Arterial Hypertension.']"""

Second, a 3D convex function representing the PF spanned by the 42 plans was fitted for each patient using three patient-specific parameters. Third, ten features were extracted from the, aforementioned, structures to train a linear-regressor prediction algorithm to predict these three patient-specific parameters. Fourth, the quality of the predictions was assessed by calculating the average and maximum distances of the predicted PF to the 42 plans for patients in the validation cohort.

A multivariate principal component analysis on CRPC in vitro models identified aspartyl (asparaginyl) β hydrolase (ASPH) as the most relevant molecule associated with the CRPC phenotype. ASPH is overexpressed in various malignant neoplasms and catalyzes the hydroxylation of aspartyl and asparaginyl residues in the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains of proteins like NOTCH receptors and ligands, enhancing cell motility, invasion and metastatic spread. Bioinformatics analyses of ASPH in prostate cancer (PCa) and CRPC datasets indicate that ASPH gene alterations have prognostic value both in PCa and CRPC patients. In CRPC cells, inhibition of ASPH expression obtained through specific small interfering RNA or culturing cells in hypoxic conditions, reduced cell proliferation, invasion and cyclin D1 expression through modulation of the NOTCH signaling. ASPH and HIF1α crosstalk, within a hydroxylation-regulated signaling pathway, might be transiently driven by the oxidative stress evidenced inside CRPC cells. In addition, increased phosphorylation of GSK3β by ASPH silencing demonstrates that ASPH regulates GSK3β activity inhibiting its interactions with upstream kinases.

With PSA screening, the post-surgery prognostic utility of clinical stage is debatable in studies seeking to identify new biomarkers. Few studies have investigated clinical stage and lethal prostate cancer association after accounting for pathological stage. We hypothesize that clinical stage provides prognostic information beyond pathological stage in the PSA era.  Methods:   Cox regression models tested associations between clinical and pathological stage and lethal prostate cancer among 3,064 participants from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study and Physicians' Health Study (HPFS/PHS) who underwent prostatectomy. Likelihood ratio tests and c-statistics were used to assess the models' prognostic utility. Equivalent analyses were performed in 16,134 men who underwent prostatectomy at Johns Hopkins.  Results:   Independently, clinical and pathological stage were associated (p<0.0001 for both) with rate of lethal prostate cancer in HPFS/PHS. The model with clinical and pathological stage fit significantly better than the model with only pathological stage in all men (p = 0.01) and in men diagnosed during the PSA era (p = 0.04). The mutually adjusted model also improved discriminatory ability. In the Johns Hopkins cohort, the model with clinical and pathological stage improved discriminatory ability and fit significantly better overall (p<0.0001) and in the PSA era (p<0.0001).

However, the biological mechanisms underlying iAs-induced prostate carcinogenesis remain unclear.  Objectives:   We studied how iAs affects normal human prostate stem-progenitor cells (PrSPCs) and drives transformation and interrogated the molecular mechanisms involved.  Methods:   PrSPCs were enriched by spheroid culture from normal human primary or immortalized prostate epithelial cells, and their differentiation capability was evaluated by organoid culture. Microarray analysis was conducted to identify iAs-dysregulated genes, and lentiviral infection was used for stable manipulation of identified genes. Soft agar colony growth assays were applied to examine iAs-induced transformation. For in vivo study, PrSPCs mixed with rat urogenital sinus mesenchyme were grafted under the renal capsule of nude mice to generate prostatelike tissues, and mice were exposed to 5 ppm (∼65μM) iAs in drinking water for 3 months.  Results:   Low-dose iAs (1μM) disturbed PrSPC homeostasis in vitro, leading to increased self-renewal and suppressed differentiation. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that iAs activated oncogenic pathways in PrSPCs, including the KEAP1-NRF2 pathway. Further, iAs-exposed proliferative progenitor cells exhibited NRF2 pathway activation that was sustained in their progeny cells. Knockdown of NRF2 inhibited spheroid formation by driving PrSPC differentiation, whereas its activation enhanced spheroid growth. Importantly, iAs-induced transformation was suppressed by NRF2 knockdown. Mechanistically, iAs suppressed Vacuolar ATPase subunit VMA5 expression, impairing lysosome acidification and inhibiting autophagic protein degradation including p62, which further activated NRF2. In vivo, chronic iAs exposure activated NRF2 in both epithelial and stroma cells of chimeric human prostate grafts and induced premalignant events.  Conclusions:   Low-dose iAs increased self-renewal and decreased differentiation of human PrSPCs by activating the p62-NRF2 axis, resulting in epithelial cell transformation. NRF2 is activated by iAs through specific autophagic flux blockade in progenitor cells, which may have potential therapeutic implications. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6471.""","""['Lishi Xie', 'Wen-Yang Hu', 'Dan-Ping Hu', 'Guangbin Shi', 'Ye Li', 'Jianfu Yang', 'Gail S Prins']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Environ Health Perspect""","""['Nrf2 and HIF1α converge to arsenic-induced metabolic reprogramming and the formation of the cancer stem-like cells.', 'Inorganic Arsenic-Related Changes in the Stromal Tumor Microenvironment in a Prostate Cancer Cell-Conditioned Media Model.', 'Enhanced p62-NRF2 Feedback Loop due to Impaired Autophagic Flux Contributes to Arsenic-Induced Malignant Transformation of Human Keratinocytes.', 'Toxicity mechanisms of arsenic that are shared with neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive impairment: Role of oxidative stress and inflammatory responses.', 'Cooperation between NRF2-mediated transcription and MDIG-dependent epigenetic modifications in arsenic-induced carcinogenesis and cancer stem cells.', 'In utero arsenic exposure increases DNA damage and gene expression changes in umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) from newborns as well as in UC-MSC differentiated hepatocytes.', 'NRF2: A crucial regulator for mitochondrial metabolic shift and prostate cancer progression.', 'Ammonium tetrathiomolybdate triggers autophagy-dependent NRF2 activation in vascular endothelial cells.', 'Reciprocal regulation of NRF2 by autophagy and ubiquitin-proteasome modulates vascular endothelial injury induced by copper oxide nanoparticles.', 'AS3MT facilitates NLRP3 inflammasome activation by m6A modification during arsenic-induced hepatic insulin resistance.']"""

Statistical tests were two-sided. Height was positively associated with localised intermediate-risk PCa (HR per 5 cm, 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.05), while overweight and obesity were negatively associated with localised low- and intermediate-risk PCa (HRs per 5 kg/m2 , 0.86, 95% CI 0.81-0.90, and 0.92, 95% CI 0.88-0.97).

However, concerns have been raised about the potential herb-drug interaction when using herbal medicines containing phytoandrogens.  Aim of the study:   This study aimed to investigate the effects of the selected 21 Chinese herbal medicines on the proliferation and tumor growth using the relevant in vitro and in vivo models of PCa.  Materials and methods:   After treatment of LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells with different concentrations of 70% ethanol extracts of the 21 selected herbal medicines for 48 h, the proliferative activity, the effects on androgen receptor (AR) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) were determined. The anti-tumor effects of the 21 herbs on PCa growth were also investigated on a subcutaneous mouse model of PCa.  Results:   The results showed that Epimedii Folium (EF) and Codonopsis Radix (CNR) could significantly increase the cell viability in LNCaP cells (p < 0.05 for both) and 22Rv1 cells (p < 0.05 for both), protein expressions of AR in LNCaP cells (p < 0.05 for both) and 22Rv1 cells (p < 0.05 for both), and PSA (p < 0.05 for both) in LNCaP cells. EF, CNR, and Cistanches Herba (CCH) markedly accentuated the tumor growth (p < 0.05 for three drugs) and AR expression (p < 0.05 for three herbs) in tumor tissues. On the other hand, treatment with Astragali Radix (AGR), Chuanxiong Rhizoma (CXR) and Bruceae Fructus (BF) significantly inhibited the cell viability in LNCaP cells (p < 0.05, p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively) and in 22Rv1 cells (p < 0.05, p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively), and the protein expression of AR in LNCaP cells (p < 0.05 for three herbs) and 22Rv1 cells (p < 0.05, p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively), and the protein expression of PSA (p < 0.05 for three herbs) in LNCaP cells, as well as tumor growth (p < 0.05 for three herbs) and the AR expression (p < 0.05 for AGR and CXR, p < 0.001 for BF) in tumor tissues.  Conclusion:   Our results revealed that AGR, CXR and BF suppressed the PCa development via inhibition of AR expression, while EF, CNR and CCH promoted the development and progression of PCa via enhancement of AR expression. The results strongly suggest that caution should be exercised when using androgenic Chinese herbal medicines in PCa patients.""","""['Zhen-Biao Zhang', 'Siu-Po Ip', 'William Chi Cho', 'Zhen Hu', 'Yan-Feng Huang', 'Dan-Dan Luo', 'Yan-Fang Xian', 'Zhi-Xiu Lin']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Ethnopharmacol""","""['Tanshinones from Chinese medicinal herb Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge) suppress prostate cancer growth and androgen receptor signaling.', 'Neoisoliquiritin exerts tumor suppressive effects on prostate cancer by repressing androgen receptor activity.', 'Cryptotanshinone suppresses androgen receptor-mediated growth in androgen dependent and castration resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgens as therapy for androgen receptor-positive castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor footprint on the way to prostate cancer progression.', 'MicroRNAs and Natural Compounds Mediated Regulation of TGF Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Anticancer Properties of Lobetyolin, an Essential Component of Radix Codonopsis (Dangshen).']"""

Synthetic and natural compounds have been explored as potential modulators of PI3K/Akt signaling that is known to drive PCa growth. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of a series of triphenyltin (IV) carboxylate derivatives against PCa. From this library, triphenylstannyl 2-(benzylcarbamoyl)benzoate (Ch-319) resulted in reduced viability and induction of cell cycle arrest in PTEN-/- PC3M and PTEN+/- DU145 cells. In parallel, downregulation of PI3K p85/p110 subunits, dephosphorylation of Akt-1 and increase in FOXO3a expression were observed. In silico studies indicated binding interactions of Ch-319 within the ATP binding site of Akt-1 at Met281, Phe442 and Glu234 residues. Elevated po-pulation of apoptotic cells, activation of Bax and reduced Bcl2 expression indicated apoptosis by Ch-319. Pre-sensitization of PCa cells with Ch-319 augmented the effect of cabazitaxel, a commonly used taxane in patients with castration-resistant PCa. Next, in a prostate-specific PTENp-/- mice, Ch-319 showed reduced weights of genitourinary apparatus as compared to DMSO treated controls. Histological studies indicated absence of neoplastic foci in Ch-319 treated prostates. Consistently, dephosphorylation of Akt-1, reduced expression of PRAS40 and androgen receptor and increase in FOXO3a were observed in treated group. Notably, no overt organ toxicity was noted in Ch-319 treated animals. Our studies identify Akt/FOXO3a signaling as a target of triphenyltin (IV) carboxylate Ch-319 and provide a molecular basis of its growth inhibitory effect in PCa cells. We propose that Ch-319 has the potential to be developed as an anticancer agent against PCa.""","""['Durdana Waseem', 'Gul Majid Khan', 'Ihsan-Ul Haq', 'Umer Rashid', 'Deeba N Syed']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Toxicol Appl Pharmacol""","""['Inhibition of AKT promotes FOXO3a-dependent apoptosis in prostate cancer.', ""Dibutylstannanediyl (2Z,2'Z)-bis(4-(benzylamino)-4-oxobut-2-enoate inhibits prostate cancer progression by activating p38 MAPK/PPARα/SMAD4 signaling."", 'S-equol, a Secondary Metabolite of Natural Anticancer Isoflavone Daidzein, Inhibits Prostate Cancer Growth In Vitro and In Vivo, Though Activating the Akt/FOXO3a Pathway.', 'Interplay Among PI3K/AKT, PTEN/FOXO and AR Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'FOXO3a signaling pathway in prostate cancer: Progress in studies.', 'Biological Evaluation of Triorganotin Derivatives as Potential Anticancer Agents.', 'Combined Anti-Cancer Effects of Platycodin D and Sorafenib on Androgen-Independent and PTEN-Deficient Prostate Cancer.']"""

We then aimed to compare these results to known risk calculators for LNM, including the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre (MSKCC) and Briganti nomograms.  Patients and methods:   Between July 2014 and September 2019 only men who had both a preoperative mpMRI and staging 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT at our institution followed by a RALP with PLND referred to a single specialist uropathology laboratory were considered for inclusion. The data were collected retrospectively prior to February 2019 and in a prospective manner thereafter. A model was built to allocate probabilities of the men with a negative 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan having a <5% risk of histologically LNM at RALP based on the preoperative radiological staging.  Results:   A total of 233 consecutive men met the inclusion criteria of which 58 men (24.9%) had a LNM identified on PLND histology. The median (range) International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Grade was 5 (1-5) and the median (range) prostate-specific antigen level was 7.4 (1.5-72) ng/mL. The median (range) number of resected lymph nodes was 16 (1-53) and the median (range) number of positive nodes identified on histology was 2 (1-22). Seminal vesicle invasion on mpMRI was more common in node-positive men than in the absence of LNM (31% vs 12%). The maximum standardised uptake value of the primary tumour on 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT was higher in men with LNM (median 9.2 vs 7.2, P = 0.02). Suspected LNM were identified in 42/233 (18.0%) men with 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT compared with 22/233 (9.4%) men with mpMRI (P = 0.023). The positive and negative predictive value for 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT was 66.7% and 84.3% respectively, compared to 59.1% and 78.7% for mpMRI. A predictive model showed only two men (4.2%) with a negative preoperative 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT would be positive for a histological LNM if they are ISUP Grade < 5 and Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) <5; or ISUP Grade 5 with PI-RADS < 4. An inspection of three additional variables: CAPRA score, MSKCC and Briganti nomograms did not improve the predictive probability for this group. However, of the 61 men with ISUP Grade 4-5 malignancy and also a PI-RADS 5 mpMRI, 20 (32.8%) men had a microscopic LNM despite a negative preoperative 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT.  Conclusion:   Preoperative 68 Ga-PSMA/PET CT was more sensitive in identifying histological pelvic LNM than 3-T mpMRI. Men with a negative 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT have a lower risk of LNM than predicted with CAPRA scores or MSKCC and Briganti nomograms. We identified that the combination of a negative preoperative 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT, ISUP biopsy Grade <5 and PI-RADS <5 prostate mpMRI, or an ISUP Grade 5 with PI-RADS <4 on mpMRI was associated with a <5% risk of a LNM. The addition of CAPRA scores, MSKCC and Briganti nomograms did not improve the predictive probability within this model. Conversely, men with ISUP Grade 4-5 malignancy associated with a PI-RADS 5 prostate mpMRI had a >30% risk of microscopic LNM despite a negative preoperative 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT and this high-risk group would appear suitable for an extended PLND at the time of a radical prostatectomy.""","""['Anthony Franklin', 'William J Yaxley', 'Sheliyan Raveenthiran', 'Geoff Coughlin', 'Troy Gianduzzo', 'Boon Kua', 'Lousie McEwan', 'David Wong', 'Brett Delahunt', 'Lars Egevad', 'Hema Samaratunga', 'Nicholas Brown', 'Rob Parkinson', 'Matthew J Roberts', 'John W Yaxley']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Re: Histological comparison between predictive value of preoperative 3-T multiparametric MRI and 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan for pathological outcomes at radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection for prostate cancer.', 'Letter to the Editor BJUI in response to Montorsi et al.: Histological comparison between predictive value of preoperative 3-T multiparametric MRI and 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan for pathological outcomes at radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection for prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET-CT with mpMRI for preoperative lymph node staging in patients with intermediate to high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Diagnostic accuracy of 68 Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron-emission tomography (PET) and multiparametric (mp)MRI to detect intermediate-grade intra-prostatic prostate cancer using whole-mount pathology: impact of the addition of 68 Ga-PSMA PET to mpMRI.', 'Outcomes of Primary Lymph Node Staging of Intermediate and High Risk Prostate Cancer with 68Ga-PSMA Positron Emission Tomography/Computerized Tomography Compared to Histological Correlation of Pelvic Lymph Node Pathology.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'Can Negative Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Avoid the Need for Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection in Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer Patients?

Methods:   The study population included 382 stage pT2-T3N0M0 PC survivors 5-10 years post diagnosis, who were identified from the multiregional Prostate Cancer Survivorship in Switzerland (PROCAS) study. Briefly, in 2017/2018, PC survivors were identified via six population-based cancer registries based in both German- and French-speaking Switzerland. HRQoL and PC-specific symptom burden was assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-PR25 questionnaires. Differences in HRQoL outcomes between survivors treated with NSRP (uni- & bilateral) and Non-NSRP were analyzed with multivariable linear regression adjusted for age, years since diagnosis, cancer stage, comorbidities at diagnosis, and further therapies, if appropriate. Multiple imputation was performed to minimize the bias due to missing data.  Results:   Five to ten years after diagnosis, PC survivors treated with NSRP and Non-NSRP reported similar symptom burden and comparable HRQoL function scores. The only significant differences were reported for sexual activity, whereas PC survivors who underwent NSRP reported statistically significant (P = .031) higher sexual activity than those on Non-NSRP.

Among four classifiers, the random forest classifier had the best performance in both patient-based and lesion-based datasets, with overall accuracy of 0.713 and 0.860, sensitivity of 0.857 and 0.613, and area under curve (AUC) of 0.771 and 0.832, respectively. In external validation, our best classifiers had an AUC of 0.688 with the best sensitivity (0.870) and specificity (0.500) in the 59 PI-RADS 3 patients in Molinette Hospital dataset.  Conclusions:   The machine learning-based random forest classifier provided a reliable probability if a PI-RADS 3 patient was benign.  Key points:   • Machine learning-based classifiers could combine the clinical characteristics with accessible information on image report of PI-RADS 3 patient to generate a probability of malignancy. • This probability could assist surgeons to make diagnostic decisions with more confidence and higher efficiency.""","""['Yansheng Kan', 'Qing Zhang', 'Jiange Hao', 'Wei Wang', 'Junlong Zhuang', 'Jie Gao', 'Haifeng Huang', 'Jing Liang', 'Giancarlo Marra', 'Giorgio Calleris', 'Marco Oderda', 'Xiaozhi Zhao', 'Paolo Gontero', 'Hongqian Guo']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Can Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2 reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies in men with PSA levels of 4-10\xa0ng/ml?', 'Optimization of clinical risk-factor interpretation and radiological findings with machine learning for PIRADS category 3 patients.', 'Multicentre evaluation of targeted and systematic biopsies using magnetic resonance and ultrasound image-fusion guided transperineal prostate biopsy in patients with a previous negative biopsy.', 'Multiparametric MRI Lesion Classified as Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System 5 but Histopathologically Described as Benign: A Case Report and Review of Literature.', 'Prostate Indeterminate Lesions on Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Biopsy Versus Surveillance: A Literature Review.', 'What benefit can be obtained from magnetic resonance imaging diagnosis with artificial intelligence in prostate cancer compared with clinical assessments?', 'Diagnostic Performance Evaluation of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in the Detection of Prostate Cancer with Supervised Machine Learning Methods.', 'Performance variability of radiomics machine learning models for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer in heterogeneous MRI datasets.', 'Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Pathological Upgrade From Combined Transperineal Systematic and MRI-Targeted Prostate Biopsy to Final Pathology: A Multicenter Retrospective Study.', 'Current Value of Biparametric Prostate MRI with Machine-Learning or Deep-Learning in the Detection, Grading, and Characterization of Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.']"""

Jumonji C domain-containing histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) are found mainly up-regulated in breast, prostate, and colon cancer. Currently, growing interest is focusing on the identification and development of new inhibitors able to block the activity of KDMs and thus reduce tumor progression. KDM4A is known to play a role in several cellular physiological processes, and was recently found overexpressed in a number of pathological states, including cancer. In this work, starting from the structure of purpurogallin 9aa, previously identified as a natural KDM4A inhibitor, we synthesized two main sets of compound derivatives in order to improve their inhibitory activity against KDM4A in vitro and in cells, as well as their antitumor action. Based on the hypothetical biogenesis of the 5-oxo-5H-benzo[7]annulene skeleton of the natural product purpurogallin (Salfeld, 1960; Horner et al., 1961; Dürckheimer and Paulus, 1985; Tanaka et al., 2002; Yanase et al., 2005) the pyrogallol and catechol units were first combined with structural modifications at different positions of the aryl ring using enzyme-mediated oxidative conditions, generating a series of benzotropolone analogs. Two of the synthetic analogs of purpurogallin, 9ac and 9bc, showed an efficient inhibition (50 and 80%) of KDM4A in enzymatic assays and in cells by increasing levels of its specific targets, H3K9me3/2 and H3K36me3. However, these two compounds/derivatives did not induce cell death. We then synthesized a further set of analogs of these two compounds with greater structural diversification. The most potent of these analogs, 9bf, displayed the highest KDM4A inhibitory enzymatic activity in vitro (IC50 of 10.1 and 24.37 μM) in colon cancer cells, and the strongest antitumor action in several solid and hematological human cancer cell lines with no toxic effect in normal cells. Our findings suggest that further development of this compound and its derivatives may lead to the identification of new therapeutic antitumor agents acting through inhibition of KDM4A.""","""['José A Souto', 'Federica Sarno', 'Angela Nebbioso', 'Chiara Papulino', 'Rosana Álvarez', 'Jessica Lombino', 'Ugo Perricone', 'Alessandro Padova', 'Lucia Altucci', 'Ángel R de Lera']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Front Chem""","""['Identification and characterization of PKF118-310 as a KDM4A inhibitor.', 'The Activity of JmjC Histone Lysine Demethylase KDM4A is Highly Sensitive to Oxygen Concentrations.', '4-Biphenylalanine- and 3-Phenyltyrosine-Derived Hydroxamic Acids as Inhibitors of the JumonjiC-Domain-Containing Histone Demethylase KDM4A.', 'Mechanistic insights into KDM4A driven genomic instability.', 'The role of the histone demethylase KDM4A in cancer.', 'Histone Demethylase Modulation: Epigenetic Strategy to Combat Cancer Progression.', 'Recent Advances with KDM4 Inhibitors and Potential Applications.', 'KDM2B overexpression prevents myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats through regulating inflammatory response via the TLR4/NF-κB p65 axis.', 'The Cross Marks the Spot: The Emerging Role of JmjC Domain-Containing Proteins in Myeloid Malignancies.', 'KDM4 Involvement in Breast Cancer and Possible Therapeutic Approaches.']"""

Pyrimethamine, an FDA-approved antimalarial drug, is known to exert an antitumor activity in various types of human cancer cells. However, whether pyrimethamine can inhibit prostate cancer is not well established. Hence, the present study aimed to characterize the mechanism of action of pyrimethamine on prostate cancer. We investigated the potential effect of pyrimethamine on cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis in metastatic DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells. We found that pyrimethamine inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest in the S phase, and promoted cell apoptosis of prostate cells in vitro; it also suppressed tumor growth in xenograft models. In addition, we observed that pyrimethamine suppressed prostate cancer growth by inhibiting the p38-NF-κB axis in vitro and in vivo. Thus, this study demonstrates that pyrimethamine is a novel p38 inhibitor that can exert antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in prostate cancer by affecting cell cycle and intrinsic apoptotic signaling, thereby providing a novel strategy for using pyrimethamine in CRPC treatment.""","""['Xumin Zhou', 'Jinming Zhang', 'Xiaoping Hu', 'Peiqing He', 'Jianyu Guo', 'Jun Li', 'Tian Lan', 'Jumei Liu', 'Lilan Peng', 'Hua Li']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Front Pharmacol""","""['Flubendazole, FDA-approved anthelmintic, elicits valid antitumor effects by targeting P53 and promoting ferroptosis in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Patient-derived Hormone-naive Prostate Cancer Xenograft Models Reveal Growth Factor Receptor Bound Protein 10 as an Androgen Receptor-repressed Gene Driving the Development of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'The small molecule WNT/β-catenin inhibitor CWP232291 blocks the growth of castration-resistant prostate cancer by activating the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway.', 'PDLIM2 suppression efficiently reduces tumor growth and invasiveness of human castration-resistant prostate cancer-like cells.', 'The multifaceted antineoplastic role of pyrimethamine against human malignancies.', 'Pyrimethamine inhibits cell growth by inducing cell senescence and boosting CD8+ T-cell mediated cytotoxicity in colorectal cancer.', 'Identification of a Novel PPAR Signature for Predicting Prognosis, Immune Microenvironment, and Chemotherapy Response in Bladder Cancer.', 'Suppressing STAT3 activity protects the endothelial barrier from VEGF-mediated vascular permeability.']"""

It was independently isolated as a growth suppressor, GRIM1, in a genetic screen. Recent studies have indicated that SHQ1 inhibits prostate cancer growth and metastasis. SHQ1 facilitates MYC RNA splicing to promote T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) development. Thus, the mechanisms of SHQ1 in cancers remain largely unknown. We report here that SHQ1 promotes tumor apoptosis and chemo-sensitivity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. In HCC tissues from patients, expression of SHQ1 was significantly decreased in the tumor compared to adjacent tissues. Experiments with HCC xenograft models revealed that restoring SHQ1 levels enhanced the anti-tumor activity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inducer tunicamycin (TM) and common chemotherapy drug paclitaxel (PTX). Mechanistically, SHQ1 is an ER-stress response gene which is regulated by p50ATF6 and XBP1s through an ER stress response like element located on the SHQ1 promoter. SHQ1 interacts with the ER chaperone GRP78 to release ER sensors PERK/IRE1α/ATF6 from GRP78/ER-sensor complexes, leading to hyper-activation of unfolded protein response (UPR). In the persistent ER stress conditions of a HepG2 xenograft tumor model, SHQ1-mediated hyper-activation of ER-sensor signaling induces apoptosis. Our study thus demonstrates a SHQ1-mediated ER-stress response feedback loop that promotes tumor sensitivity to chemotherapeutics.""","""['Huimin Liu#', 'Siqi Xie#', 'Fang Fang', 'Dhananjaya V Kalvakolanu', 'Weihua Xiao']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Mechanism of the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress by the anti-cancer agent, di-2-pyridylketone 4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT): Activation of PERK/eIF2α, IRE1α, ATF6 and calmodulin kinase.', 'IRE1α dissociates with BiP and inhibits ER stress-mediated apoptosis in cartilage development.', 'The Hsp90 inhibitor SNX-2112 induces apoptosis of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells: the role of ER stress.', 'The endoplasmic reticulum stress/unfolded protein response in gliomagenesis, tumor progression and as a therapeutic target in glioblastoma.', 'Molecular signal networks and regulating mechanisms of the unfolded protein response.', 'The Antitumor Effect of TPD52L2 Silencing on Oxaliplatin-Resistant Gastric Carcinoma Is Related to Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress In Vitro.', 'ER stress in obesity pathogenesis and management.', 'Downregulation of RIP3 Improves the Protective Effect of ATF6 in an Acute Liver Injury Model.', 'The Role of Autophagy in Gastric Cancer Chemoresistance: Friend or Foe?']"""

The histone demethylase JMJD1A has been shown to regulate activities of AR and c-Myc transcription factors and promote prostate cancer progression. Here, we report that JMJD1A protein stability is controlled by the ubiquitin ligase STUB1. High levels of JMJD1A were strongly correlated with low STUB1 levels in human CRPC specimens. STUB1 inhibited AR activity, AR-V7 levels, and prostate cancer cell growth partly through degradation of JMJD1A. Furthermore, the acetyltransferase p300 acetylated JMJD1A at lysine (K) 421, a modification that recruits the BET family member BRD4 to block JMJD1A degradation and promote JMJD1A recruitment to AR targets. Increased levels of both total and K421-acetylated JMJD1A were observed in prostate cancer cells as they developed resistance to the AR antagonist enzalutamide. Treatment of prostate cancer cells with either p300 or BET inhibitors destabilized JMJD1A, and enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells were more sensitive than parental cells to these inhibitors. Together, our findings identify a critical role for acetylation of JMJD1A in regulating JMJD1A stability and AR activity in CRPC. These newly identified mechanisms controlling JMJD1A protein stability provide potential druggable targets to encourage the development of additional therapies for advanced prostate cancer.

Our data showed that miR-218 bound to the Grb2-associated binding protein 2 (GAB2) 3'-UTR region and inhibited GAB2 expression.

We demonstrated for the first time that the expression of GAB2 in the PCa cell lines was increased, while knocking down GAB2 significantly inhibited cell growth, metastatic ability and EMT process in PCa. In addition, the recovery of GAB2 could reverse the changes in the biological function of PCa cells caused by the ectopic expression of miR-218. Mechanistically, miR-218-mediated GAB2 transcriptional suppression significantly inhibited the activity of the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β pathway, whose abnormal activation was found to be related to the malignant progression of PCa.

ADT often increases plasma LDL and HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. The aim was to test whether ADT changes the transfer of lipids to HDL, an important aspect of this metabolism and HDL protective functions, and related parameters.  Methods:   Sixteen volunteers with advanced prostate carcinoma submitted to pharmacological ADT or orchiectomy had plasma collected shortly before and after 6 months of ADT. In vitro transfer of lipids to HDL was performed by incubating plasma with donor emulsion containing radioactive lipids by 1 h at 37 °C. After chemical precipitation of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoprotein, the radioactivity of HDL fraction was counted.  Results:   ADT reduced testosterone to nearly undetectable levels and markedly diminished PSA. ADT increased the body weight but glycemia, triglycerides, LDL and HDL cholesterol, HDL lipid composition and CETP concentration were unchanged. However, ADT increased the plasma unesterified cholesterol concentration (48 ± 12 vs 56 ± 12 mg/dL, p = 0.019) and LCAT concentration (7.15 ± 1.81 vs 8.01 ± 1.55μg/mL, p = 0.020). Transfer of unesterified (7.32 ± 1.09 vs 8.18 ± 1.52%, p < 0.05) and esterified cholesterol (6.15 ± 0.69 vs 6.94 ± 1.29%, p < 0.01) and of triglycerides (6.37 ± 0.43 vs 7.18 ± 0.91%, p < 0.001) to HDL were increased after ADT. Phospholipid transfer was unchanged.  Conclusion:   Increase in transfer of unesterified and esterified cholesterol protects against cardiovascular disease, as shown previously, and increased LCAT favors cholesterol esterification and facilitates the reverse cholesterol transport. Thus, our results suggest that ADT may offer anti-atherosclerosis protection by improving HDL functional properties.

However, whether eIF5A2 could be as the target for prostate cancer (PCa) treatment is still unknown. In this study, small interfering RNA specific for eIF5A2 (eIF5A2 siRNA) and lentivector for eIF5A2 shRNA (Lv-eIF5A2 shRNA) was performed to down-regulate eIF5A2 expression in PCa PC-3 M IE8 cells and in animal tumor model, respectively. The biological function of eIF5A2 siRNA or Lv-eIF5A2 shRNA on PC-3 M IE8 cell growth, apoptosis, migration, invasion and lung metastasis were explored. The results showed that targeting eIF5A2 inhibited PC-3 M IE8 cell invasion, migration, proliferation and increased cell apoptosis in vitro, and inhibited tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo. Analysis of eIF5A2 signaling pathways in the clonal derivatives showed a decrease in MMP-2 and MMP-9 activation and increase in bcl-2 expression. We therefore concluded that therapies targeting the eIF5A2 signaling pathway may be more effective to prevent organ metastasis and primary tumor formation.""","""['Xiulong Zhong', 'Hong Xiu', 'Yanan Bi', 'Hongmei Zhang', 'Laizhen Chang', 'Huifeng Diao']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Bioengineered""","""['Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A2 regulates the migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells via pathways involving reactive oxygen species.', 'Sonic Hedgehog-GLI Family Zinc Finger 1 Signaling Pathway Promotes the Growth and Migration of Pancreatic Cancer Cells by Regulating the Transcription of Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 5A2.', 'EIF5A2 Is Highly Expressed in Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma and Is Associated With Tumor Growth by Modulating TGF- Signals.', 'Roles of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A2 in human cancer.', 'Eukaryotic initiation factor 5A2 and human digestive system neoplasms.', 'LncRNA nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group F member 1 antisense RNA 1 (NR2F1-AS1) aggravates nucleus pulposus cell apoptosis and extracellular matrix degradation.', 'Chromodomain Helicase DNA Binding Protein 1-like, a negative regulator of Forkhead box O3a, promotes the proliferation and migration of Angiotensin II-induced vascular smooth muscle cells.', 'Multifaceted roles of CCL20 (C-C motif chemokine ligand 20): mechanisms and communication networks in breast cancer progression.', 'High expression of ladinin-1 (LAD1) predicts adverse outcomes: a new candidate docetaxel resistance gene for prostatic cancer (PCa).']"""

Methods:   A total of 57 PCa patients definitely diagnosed via prostate biopsy underwent bilateral orchiectomy. No patient had history of diabetes mellitus before operation. The hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, albumin and alkaline phosphatase in the blood before operation and at 1 year after operation were analyzed using a full-automatic biochemistry analyzer, and the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in the peripheral blood were calculated.  Results:   The levels of serum testosterone (T) and free testosterone (FT) in PCa patients declined remarkably at 1 month after castration. Compared with those before operation, the levels of serum T and FT were decreased significantly at 1, 2, 4 and 8 months as well as 1 year after castration. The levels of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were elevated gradually with the prolongation of time after operation. The level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) displayed an apparent rising trend from 2 months after surgical castration. The results of flow cytometry indicated that the levels of cluster of differentiation (CD) 4+ and CD4+/CD8+ were lowered markedly, while that of CD8+ was raised significantly in comparison with those before castration (p<0.05) After castration, both fasting blood glucose and fasting insulin were increased obviously in the patients (p<0.05). The 2 h postprandial blood glucose and insulin were raised distinctly at 1 month after castration (p<0.05). The insulin resistance index was increased persistently and prominently (p<0.05).

Abiraterone is an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor which is currently in use as a standard treatment in clinics to impair tumor growth. Development of resistance to anticancer therapies is unfortunately a very common feature of cancer cells that threatens the patient lives. This study aimed to investigate whether FGF-2 and HGF act as a possible resistant mechanism to the abiraterone activity on the androgen synthesis pathway in PC.  Methods:   The intracellular levels of 17-OH progesterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) were determined by enzyme immunoassays in cell lysates of LNCaP and PC3 PC cells upon co-treatment of cells with abiraterone and FGF-2 or HGF.  Results:   Abiraterone treatment resulted in significant reduction in the intracellular levels of 17-OH progesterone and DHT in both LnCap and PC3 cells. FGF-2 and HGF were found to decrease the intracellular levels of 17-OH progesterone in both cell lines, whereas HGF alone was found to increase the intracellular levels of DHT only in PC3 cells. However, the simultaneous exposure of cells to abiraterone and FGF-2 or HGF was found to result in an increase in the intracellular levels of DHT, while it did not result in changes in the intracellular levels of 17-OH progesterone.  Conclusion:   These findings suggest that FGF-2 and HGF may act as an escape mechanism, aiding the development of resistance to abiraterone by restoring intra-tumoral androgen synthesis that may contribute to disease progression.""","""['Chrysoula Vasileiou', 'Christina Befani', 'Konstantinos Dimas', 'Panagiotis Liakos', 'Christos Papandreou']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J BUON""","""['Conversion of abiraterone to D4A drives anti-tumour activity in prostate cancer.', 'Dihydrotestosterone synthesis pathways from inactive androgen 5α-androstane-3β,17β-diol in prostate cancer cells: Inhibition of intratumoural 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activities by abiraterone.', 'Autocrine effect of DHT on FGF signaling and cell proliferation in LNCaP cells: role of heparin/heparan-degrading enzymes.', ""Cabozantinib Inhibits Abiraterone's Upregulation of IGFIR Phosphorylation and Enhances Its Anti-Prostate Cancer Activity."", 'Effect of fibroblastic growth factors (FGF) on steroid UDP-glucuronosyltransferase expression and activity in the LNCaP cell line.']"""

Besides the better-known artemisinin, Artemisia annua L. contains numerous active compounds not well-studied yet. High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode-array and mass spectrometric detection (HPLC-DAD-MS) was used for the analysis of the most abundant compounds of an Artemisia annua extract exhibiting toxicity to MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells. Artemisinin, 6,7-dimethoxycoumarin, arteannuic acid were not toxic to any of the cancer cell lines tested. The flavonols chrysosplenol d and casticin selectively inhibited the viability of the TNBC cell lines, MDA-MB-231, CAL-51, CAL-148, as well as MCF7, A549, MIA PaCa-2, and PC-3. PC-3 prostate cancer cells exhibiting high basal protein kinase B (AKT) and no ERK1/2 activation were relatively resistant, whereas MDA-MB-231 cells with high basal ERK1/2 and low AKT activity were more sensitive to chrysosplenol d treatment. In vivo, chrysosplenol d and casticin inhibited MDA-MB-231 tumor growth on chick chorioallantoic membranes. Both compounds induced mitochondrial membrane potential loss and apoptosis. Chrysosplenol d activated ERK1/2, but not other kinases tested, increased cytosolic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induced autophagy in MDA-MB-231 cells.

Thereafter, 150 patients with different stages of prostate cancer underwent 30-min online (Australia) or computer-assisted/personal interviews categorised on the five key themes identified, in order to more fully clarify the nature of patient perceptions of how their prostate cancer had been treated and the issues they felt could be more fully addressed in order to improve the management of this condition.  Results:   Interviews indicated common challenges and unmet needs among patients, including: (i) patients' feelings and emotional state change during their disease journey, (ii) patients lack of knowledge about prostate cancer and disease progression prior to diagnosis, (iii) patients felt shared decision-making was uncommon, (iv) patients have misperceptions about surgery, and (v) patients have unmet needs for greater information and support to manage their condition.  Conclusions:   These patient perceptions of unmet needs in prostate cancer management stand in contrast to patient awareness of other common diseases such as heart failure and diabetes.

Patients and methods:   In all, 300 consecutive patients undergoing RARP by a single surgeon were randomised to three groups: endoscopic stapling, cut and suture ligation, and suture ligation with suspension. The only difference between the groups was the technique to control the DVC. Pad-free continence (PFC) and overall continence (0 pads/day with or without security pad) were assessed with patient reported pad usage records and validated questionnaires (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index) at 3, 12, and 15 months. Secondary endpoints were erectile function (EF) recovery (defined as erections sufficient for sexual activity) and the rate of apical surgical margins. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to determine predictors for recovery of both urinary continence and EF.  Results:   The three groups were comparable in terms of age, body mass index, prostate size, American Urological Association symptom score, Sexual Health Inventory for Men, and clinical stage. There were no differences found in terms of operative times, estimated blood loss, pathological stage, and positive apical margin. There was no difference between the three groups with regard to overall continence or PFC at 3 months. However, overall continence at 15 months for ligation and suspension was 99% and was superior to stapler (88%) (P = 0.002) and cut and suture ligation (88%) (P = 0.002). Additionally, PFC at 15 months was superior for ligation and suspension (87%) as compared to stapler (73%) and cut and suture ligation (75%) (P = 0.045). The technique of DVC control did not impact EF. Men with nerve sparing had better continence compared to no nerve sparing at 3 months (62% vs 42%, P = 0.045), but not at 15 months. The median time to continence was 2 months for patients receiving nerve sparing compared to 4.5 months for non-nerve sparing (P = 0.02).  Conclusion:   Suture suspension of the DVC during RARP contributes to higher overall continence rates compared to stapling and cut and suture.

We report the treatments and outcomes of patients at our institution with PCa recurrences detected on F-fluciclovine PET/CT.  Methods:   We identified men with recurrent PCa detected on F-fluciclovine PET/CT performed between 2017 and 2018 who were previously treated definitively and analyzed their patterns of care and cancer-specific outcomes.  Results:   We identified 28 men with recurrent PCa detected on F-fluciclovine PET/CT. Twenty-three were initially treated with surgery and 13 also received postoperative radiation therapy (RT). Five patients were initially treated with definitive radiation. After surgery, the median time to F-fluciclovine PET/CT was 67 months (median prostate-specific antigen [PSA] of 1.63 ng/mL). After RT, the median time to F-fluciclovine PET/CT was 95 months with median PSA of 13.31 ng/mL. Six men recurred locally, 9 recurred in the pelvic nodes, 9 had distant nodal recurrences, and 4 had osseous metastases. Of the patients initially treated with surgery, 4 received salvage radiation and 3 received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Of the patients initially treated with surgery and postoperative RT, 3 received salvage pelvic nodal dissection, 4 received salvage radiation, and 2 received ADT.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the treatment of asthma. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of montelukast sodium on children with cough-variant asthma (CVA) and the role of lncRNA prostate cancer gene expression marker 1 (PCGEM1) in drug efficacy. The efficacy of montelukast sodium was evaluated by assessing the release of inflammatory factors and pulmonary function in CVA children after a 3-month treatment. An ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized mouse model was developed to simulate asthmatic conditions. PCGEM1 expression in clinical peripheral blood samples and lung tissues of asthmatic mice was determined. Asthmatic mice experienced nasal inhalation of PCGEM1 overexpression with simultaneous montelukast sodium to investigate the roles of PCGEM1 in asthma treatment. The NF-κB axis after PCGEM1 overexpression was detected to explore the underling mechanisms. Consequently, montelukast sodium contributed to reduced levels of pro-inflammatory factors and improved pulmonary function in CVA children. PCGEM1 was poorly expressed in OVA-sensitized asthmatic mice and highly expressed in CVA children with response to the treatment. PCGEM1 overexpression enhanced the anti-inflammatory effects and promoted effects on pulmonary function of montelukast sodium in CVA children and OVA-sensitized asthmatic mice. Furthermore, PCGEM1 inhibited the activation of the NF-κB axis. This study demonstrated the anti-inflammatory and lung-protective effects of montelukast sodium on CVA, which was strengthened by overexpression of PCGEM1.

We determined predictors of biopsy reclassification at specific time points after enrollment on active surveillance.  Materials and methods:   We identified men with clinically low risk prostate cancer prospectively enrolled on active surveillance at the University of California, San Francisco between 2000 and 2016. Biopsy reclassification was defined as Gleason Grade Group 2 or greater on subsequent biopsy. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to identify factors associated with risk of biopsy reclassification at first surveillance biopsy and 1 to 3, 3 to 5 and 5 to 10 years after enrollment, adjusting for clinicodemographic factors, PI-RADS® (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System) score and genomic testing.  Results:   A total of 1,031 men were included in the study. On multivariable analysis biopsy reclassification was associated with prostate specific antigen density 0.15 or greater (HR 3.37, 95% CI 1.83-6.21), percentage biopsy cores positive (HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05-1.54) and high genomic score (HR 2.81, 95% CI 1.21-6.52) at first surveillance biopsy and also at 1 to 3 years, after adjustment. Prostate specific antigen density 0.15 or greater (HR 2.36, 95% CI 1.56-3.56) and prostate specific antigen kinetics (HR 2.19, 95% CI 1.43-3.34) were associated with reclassification at 3 to 5 years. A PI-RADS 4-5 score was not associated with biopsy reclassification at any time point.  Conclusions:   High genomic score, prostate specific antigen kinetics and prostate specific antigen density 0.15 or greater were associated with reclassification within 3 years of commencing active surveillance, and prostate specific antigen kinetics and prostate specific antigen density 0.15 or greater remained associated with reclassification at 5 years after diagnosis.""","""['Peter E Lonergan', 'Samuel L Washington rd', 'Janet E Cowan', 'Shoujun Zhao', 'Hao G Nguyen', 'Katsuto Shinohara', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Peter R Carroll']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'PI-RADS® Category as a Predictor of Progression to Unfavorable Risk Prostate Cancer in Men on Active Surveillance.', 'The Long-Term Risks of Metastases in Men on Active Surveillance for Early Stage Prostate Cancer.', 'The Risk of Prostate Cancer Progression in Active Surveillance Patients with Bilateral Disease Detected by Combined Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Fusion and Systematic Biopsy.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in the management and diagnosis of prostate cancer: current applications and strategies.', 'Active surveillance for prostate cancer: when to recommend delayed intervention.', 'Prostate Cancer Tumor Volume and Genomic Risk.']"""

Although various types of lncRNAs in prostate cancer (PCa) have been explored, quantities of lncRNAs still wait to be exploited. The present study is to probe the functions and mechanism of lncRNA HOXA cluster antisense RNA 2 (HOXA-AS2) in PCa. In the present study, we discovered that HOXA-AS2 was highly expressed in PCa tissues and cells. HOXA-AS2 depletion obviously influenced cell proliferation, migration, invasion, as well as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression. In addition, miR-509-3p had low expression in PCa cells and inversely modulated by HOXA-AS2. Cutting down HOXA-AS2 expression was capable of up-regulating miR-509-3p expression. In addition, HOXA-AS2 served as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) through sponging miR-509-3p to release pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 3 (PBX3) expression. The expression of PBX3 was noticeably high in tumor tissues. And PBX3 expression level was down-regulated markedly with the knockdown of HOXA-AS2. Rescue experiments certified the facilitated role of HOXA-AS2-miR-509-3p-PBX3 axis in regulating the progress of PCa.

Methods:   This multi-institutional retrospective study included 371 patients treated using SRT after RP. The median (range) PSA level at BCR was 0.36 (0.10-2.00) ng/mL. The association between early SRT (ie, starting PSA level < 0.50) and BCR after SRT was tested in each subgroup according to our own risk stratification.

By multivariate analysis, pT3b, Gleason score ≥ 8, negative surgical margins, PSA doubling time < 6 months, and non-early SRT were associated with BCR after SRT. Patients were stratified by four risk factors other than non-early SRT: (1) low risk (0 risk factor), (2) intermediate risk (1 risk factor), and (3) high risk (≥2 risk factors). The BCR-free survival was higher in the early SRT group than the nonearly SRT group in the high-risk subgroup (P = 0.020), whereas that was similar between two groups in the low-risk and intermediate-risk subgroups (P = .79 and .18, respectively).

In this study, we set out from the cellular interaction to further explain the molecular mechanism of invasion in GC cells under hypoxic conditions.  Methods:   Gastric cancer cells were cultured under 1% O2 (hypoxia-cultured gastric cancer cells, HGC) and 20% O2 condition (normoxic-cultured gastric cancer cells, NGC). NGC was co-cultured with HGC-medium. Scrape and Transwell were used to evaluate invasion and migration. Exosomes from GC were extracted by ultracentrifugation. Electron microscopy images, western-blot used to analyze the size distributions and the number of exosomes.  Results:   HGC-medium induced NGC dissociated. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) prostate cancer gene expression marker 1 (PCGEM1) was specifically expressed in HGC exosomes. HGC-derived PCGEM1-riched exosomes could promote the invasion and migration of NGC. On the mechanism, PCGEM1 maintained stability and reduced the degradation of SNAI1, which could induce the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of GC.  Conclusion:   LncRNA PCGEM1 was overexpressed in GC cells. And part of the PCGEM1 can be encapsulated into exosomes. These exosomes promoted invasion and migration of other GC cells.

We enrolled 82,548 study participants with 262,035 visits. A Cox proportional hazards model and Cox frailty model were used for calculating the hazard ratios under different periodontal status by using SAS and Rstudio.  Results:   Being male, elderly, having a low education level, and smoking were risk factors for mortality in this retrospective elderly community cohort study. Participants with periodontitis followed across time had significantly higher hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality and all-cancer mortality (HR = 1.092, 95% confidence interval (CI):1.038 to 1.149, HR = 1.114, 95% CI:1.032 to 1.203, respectively) in the Cox frailty models after adjusting for age, marital status, education level, sex, and smoking status. After adjusting for age and sex, the hazard ratio was 1.185 (95% CI: 1.027 to 1.368) for lung cancer mortality, and 1.340 (95% CI: 1.019 to 1.762) for prostate cancer mortality in the periodontitis group with each visit.

However, ADT has been reported to cause negative side effects on cognition and emotional processing. So far, research referred to the effects of short-term treatment. Since the brain may adapt to androgen deprivation, we were especially interested in the long-term effects of ADT on cognitive and socioeconomic decision making.  Methods:   Participants underwent a battery of tests that have been associated with testosterone. We compared the results of three matched test groups: (1) prostate cancer patients with ADT up to 20 years, (2) prostate cancer controls without treatment and (3) healthy controls. We further measured the morning testosterone content in participants' saliva.  Results:   Testosterone concentration was positively associated with visuospatial performance across and within the test groups. Patients with long-term ADT showed an overall decline in cognitive performance. Compared with untreated patients, ADT was also associated with a reduced intergroup bias during socioeconomic decision making, which was in line with previous observations in young men suggesting that testosterone may promote ingroup favoritism. Finally, depression scores were increased in ADT, while quality of life was negatively associated with the treatment.  Conclusion:   These findings conform to results made after short-term treatment. ADT promotes negative side effects on cognitive function. We also show for the first time that testosterone deprivation may affect socioeconomic decision making. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that these effects cannot outweigh the previously described advantages of ADT in the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Sarah Katharina Charlotte Holtfrerich', 'Sophie Knipper', 'Janna Purwins', 'Jasmin Castens', 'Burkhard Beyer', 'Thorsten Schlomm', 'Esther Kristina Diekhof']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Psychooncology""","""['Effects of long-term androgen deprivation therapy on cognitive function over 36 months in men with prostate cancer.', 'Cognitive problems in patients on androgen deprivation therapy: a qualitative pilot study.', 'Effects of Androgen Deprivation Therapy on Pain Perception, Quality of Life, and Depression in Men With Prostate Cancer.', 'Cognitive functioning in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Cognitive effects of hormone therapy in men with prostate cancer: a review.', 'The Clinical, Diagnostic, Therapeutic, and Prognostic Characteristics of Brain Metastases in Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Assessment and Management of Cognitive Function in Patients with Prostate Cancer Treated with Second-Generation Androgen Receptor Pathway Inhibitors.', 'Patient participation in treatment decision-making of prostate cancer: a qualitative study.', 'Long-Term Cognitive Dysfunction in Cancer Survivors.']"""

However, little is known about how self-reported cancer affects longitudinal AD progression, the primary outcome in clinical trials and observational studies.  Objective:   To determine self-reported cancer history's effect on longitudinal AD progression in an observational study.  Methods:   We utilized data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to evaluate progression to AD by self-reported all-cancer, breast, prostate, colorectal, or non-melanoma skin cancer history. Linear mixed effects models were used to examine baseline differences and rates of progression on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) by self-reported cancer history. Age at AD onset was examined using consensus clinical diagnoses with Cox proportional hazards regression.  Results:   Among 1,271 participants, models revealed no significant differences in progression over time but did reveal significantly lower baseline ADAS-Cog score, indicating better cognition at a given age in those with self-reported cancer history. Cox models indicated those with self-reported cancer history had significantly later age of AD onset (HR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.53-0.85) after adjustment for covariates.  Conclusion:   Participants with self-reported cancer history entered ADNI with better cognition and later age of AD onset, but progressed similarly to participants without such history, indicating differences in AD between those with and without self-reported cancer history emerge early in the disease course. Such differences in longitudinal progression by self-reported cancer history could affect AD trials and observational studies, given the current focus on early disease course.

Material and methods:   The document is based on the scarce evidence on SARS/Cov-2 and the experience of the authors in handling COVID-19 in their institutions, including specialists from Andalusia, Cantabria, Catalonia, Madrid and the Valencian Community.  Results:   The authors defined different priorities for the different clinical situations in PC. Emergency/urgency (life-threatening or urgent even in normal situation), highpriority/elective urgency (potentially dangerous if postponed for more than 1 month), intermediate/electivepriority (it is recommended not to delay more than 6 months), low priority/delayed (can be postponed more than 6 months). According to this classification, the working panel agreed on the distribution of the different diagnostic, therapeutic and follow-up scenarios for PC. The risk of severe morbidity as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection may out weigh the risk of PC morbidity/mortalityin many men; therefore, in the short term it is unlikely that delays in diagnosis or treatment can led to worse cancer outcomes.  Conclusions:   The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a challenge for our health system, which raises several considerations in the treatment of patients with PC. The redistribution of surgical procedures according to the degrees of priority is essential during the period of the pandemic and the transition to the new normality.

However, no local data is available describing how PSA testing is offered by our healthcare facilities in the country. The objectives of this study were to describe PSA testing and subsequent prostate biopsy uptake in a South African urban population.  Methods:   this was a descriptive retrospective study. Data of all PSA tests and prostate biopsies performed at Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital (CMJAH) laboratory for 2013 calendar year was extracted from the laboratory information system.  Results:   a total of 20 365 PSA tests were performed on 17 481 men during the study period. The majority of men were Black African (79%). The mean age for Black Africans (55.5 years, SD 13.3) was significantly lower than other racial groups (62.9 years, SD 12.6, p < 0.0005). PSA level was lower in Black Africans compared to others. Prostate biopsy uptake across all age groups was lower in Black African men compared to others (2% versus 4%, p = 0.01). Of the 423 men who had a prostate biopsy, 50% had prostate cancer. More Black African men were diagnosed with prostate cancer on biopsy compared to men of other racial groups (54% versus 43%, p = 0.03).  Conclusion:   our study confirms that PSA testing is prevalent in healthcare facilities in South Africa. Black African men are tested for PSA levels but have low biopsy uptake and are more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer.""","""['Mpho Reginah Maphayi', 'Naseem Cassim', 'Braimoh Bello', 'Jaya Anna George']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Pan Afr Med J""","""['Problems with prostate specific antigen screening for prostate cancer in the primary healthcare setting in South Africa.', 'Clinical presentation of prostate cancer in black South Africans.', 'The Relationship of Baseline Prostate Specific Antigen and Risk of Future Prostate Cancer and Its Variance by Race.', 'Social ecological predictors of prostate-specific antigen blood test and digital rectal examination in black American men.', 'Ethnic differences in prostate-specific antigen levels in men without prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Retrospective analysis to describe trends in first-ever prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing for primary healthcare facilities in the Gauteng Province, South Africa, between 2006 and 2016.', 'mCRPC Patients Receiving 225Ac-PSMA-617 Therapy in the Post-Androgen Deprivation Therapy Setting: Response to Treatment and Survival Analysis.']"""

Here, we describe outcomes of oligoprogressive CRPC treated with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR).  Objective:   To report outcomes of oligoprogressive CRPC treated with MDT using SABR.  Design, setting, and participants:   Patients with oligoprogressive CRPC were retrospectively evaluated, and outcomes following MDT were reported. Outcomes were additionally compared with oligoprogressive CRPC treated with change in systemic therapy alone.  Intervention:   SABR to oligoprogressive lesions.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Outcomes of interest were time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure, time to next intervention (TTNI), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and overall survival. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and univariable analysis and multivariable analysis (MVA) were performed.  Results and limitations:   A total of 68 patients were included. After MDT, median time to PSA recurrence, TTNI, and DMFS were 9.7, 15.6, and 10.8 months, respectively. A total of 112 lesions were treated, and the cumulative incidences of local failure at 12 and 24 months were 2.1% and 13.8%, respectively. Factors associated with the risk of local recurrence on univariable analysis were age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.07, p = 0.03) and Gleason grade group (HR 2.20, p = 0.07). Compared with change in systemic therapy alone (n = 52), MDT (n = 31) was associated with improved median time to PSA failure (9.7 vs 4.2 months, p = 0.066)), TTNI (14.9 vs 8.8 months, p = 0.025), and DMFS (12.7 vs 8.9 months, p = 0.045), and remained associated with improved outcomes on MVA.  Conclusions:   In a retrospective cohort of oligoprogressive CRPC patients, MDT was associated with favorable outcomes and improved cancer control as compared with change in systemic treatment alone. Future prospective trials are needed to confirm these findings.  Patient summary:   In this report, we retrospectively analyzed outcomes of patients with oligoprogressive castrate-resistant prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy to progressing lesions. Our results suggest that treatment of these lesions with radiation therapy can result in sustained periods of disease-free survival and might add benefit in addition to systemic therapy at the time of progression.

The health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes using this novel approach are important in shared decision making for patients.  Objective:   To report HRQoL using both patient- and clinician-reported outcomes at 1 yr following stereotactic MRgRT for patients with localized PC.  Design, setting, and participants:   A prospective phase 2 trial included 101 patients with localized PC.  Intervention:   All patients received 36.25Gy in five fractions of MRgRT delivered within 2 wk.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   HRQoL was prospectively assessed at baseline, at the last fraction, at 6 wk, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 mo after treatment, by patient-reported outcome measures using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PR25 questionnaires, and International Prostate Symptom Score. At the same time points, clinicians reported on symptomatic adverse events (AEs). Effect sizes for changes in HRQoL were calculated with repeated measures analysis of variance.  Results and limitations:   Availability of HRQoL data exceeded 95% at all study time points. From both questionnaires and the recorded AEs, the largest treatment effects on urinary and bowel symptoms were recorded in the first 6 wk of follow-up. Thereafter, all symptoms decreased and returned to baseline values at 12 mo. No grade ≥3 toxicity was reported. No patient reported any relevant limitation due to urinary symptoms, and only 2.2% of patients reported a relevant impact on daily activities due to bowel problems at 1 yr. The majority of patients had intermediate- or high-risk PC for which androgen deprivation therapy (83.2%) was prescribed, thereby precluding study of MRgRT on sexual function. Longer follow-up is awaited in order to evaluate the oncological outcome.  Conclusions:   Delivery of MRgRT for SBRT resulted in low toxicity at 1 yr.

However, questions remain regarding feasibility and generalizability of technique and outcomes.  Objective:   To compare the outcomes of 140 consecutive standard robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (S-RARP) versus RS-RARP.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 70 S-RARPs were performed followed by 70 RS-RARPs. Demographic, pathologic, and functional outcomes were compared preoperatively and through 12 mo. Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice (EPIC-CP) was used to compare functional outcomes. Logistic and linear regression analyses were utilized to analyze variables associated with EPIC-CP urinary incontinence and overall quality of life (QOL) scores, and oncologic outcomes. Cox regression analysis was used to analyze incontinence at 12 mo.  Surgical procedure:   RS-RARP versus S-RARP.  Measurements:   Patient and tumor characteristics (age, body mass index, prostate-specific antigen, Charlson Comorbidity Index, Gleason group, clinical stage, and Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System score), perioperative outcomes (console time, estimated blood loss, postoperative complications, and length of stay), oncologic outcomes (positive surgical margin [PSM], and biochemical recurrence), overall and 12-mo continence rates (zero pads and zero to one safety pad), time to continence, potency (erection sufficient for sexual activity), EPIC-CP urinary incontinence, sexual function, and overall QOL scores.  Results and limitations:   Median follow-up for S-RARP versus RS-RARP was 46.3 versus 12.3 mo. RS-RARP versus S-RARP had improved overall continence rates at total follow-up (95.7% vs 85.7%, p = 0.042) and 12-mo follow-up (97.6% vs 81.4%, p = 0.002), and faster return to continence (zero to one safety pad, 44 vs 131 d, p < 0.001). RS-RARP EPIC-CP urinary incontinence and overall QOL scores remained significantly better at 12 mo. There were no differences in overall PSM rates, although RS-RARP had lower rates of nonfocal PSMs. There were no differences in sexual function. In multivariate analysis, RS-RARP was significantly associated with improved 12-mo EPIC-CP urinary incontinence and improved QOL scores, but was not associated with PSM or biochemical recurrence. Limitations include retrospective study design and unequal follow-up; however, significantly better RS-RARP continence at 12 mo is striking despite fewer patients attaining 12-mo follow-up.  Conclusions:   RS-RARP significantly improves early and long-term continence without compromising oncologic outcomes and leads to overall improved QOL.

Materials and methods:   All patients referred for prostate biopsy due to an elevated prostate-specific antigen or abnormal digital rectal exam in a 19-months period at Kaiser Permanente Northern California underwent a standardized systematic, ultrasound-guided biopsy scheme (14-cores for initial biopsy, 18-20 cores for repeat biopsy). All pertinent clinical variables were prospectively collected. The highest Gleason score for each patient was recorded for all positive biopsies. We used a split sample design to develop and validate 3 multivariable prediction models using multinomial logistic regression with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. All models included these core variables: age, race, prostate-specific antigen, prior biopsy status, body mass index, and family history of CaP. Model 1 included only the core variables, Model 2 added digital rectal exam, and Model 3 added digital rectal exam and prostate volume. We considered 3 outcomes: high-grade disease (Gleason score ≥7), low-grade disease (Gleason score = 6), and no cancer. Predictive discrimination was quantified using the c-statistic.  Results:   Complete data were available for 2,967 patients. Cancer was found in 50% of patients: of these, 58% were Gleason score ≥7 and 42% were low grade. Compared to Caucasians, African Americans were at a higher risk while Asians and Hispanics were at a lower risk for overall and high-grade cancer detection. The number of prior negative biopsies was also protective for these outcomes. The c-statistics for Model 1, 2, and 3 to predict high-grade disease vs. low-grade or no cancer were 0.76, 0.79, and 0.85, respectively. The c-statistics for Model 1, 2, and 3 to predict any CaP vs. no cancer were 0.69, 0.70, and 0.79, respectively. All models were well calibrated for all outcomes.

MBV, SUVmean, and TBU were affected by lesion size, uptake ratio, and SUV cut-off level; however, TBU demonstrated the most stable %Error. The TBU %Error was within 15% in spheres 17 mm or larger when the SUV cut-off level was 7, regardless of the uptake ratio. The ROC analyses revealed the AUCs of BSI (0.977) and TBU (0.968).

Methods and materials:   Between 2012 and 2015, 165 patients with prostate cancer from 9 centers were randomized and treated with SBRT delivered either every other day (arm A, n = 82) or once a week (arm B, n = 83); 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions were prescribed to the prostate with (n = 92) or without (n = 73) inclusion of the seminal vesicles (SV), and the urethra planning-risk volume received 32.5 Gy. Patients were treated either with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT; n = 112) or with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT; n = 53). Deviations from protocol dose constraints, planning target volume (PTV) homogeneity index, PTV Dice similarity coefficient, and number of monitor units for each treatment plan were retrospectively analyzed. Dosimetric results of VMAT versus IMRT and treatment plans with versus without inclusion of SV were compared.  Results:   At least 1 major protocol deviation occurred in 51 patients (31%), whereas none was observed in 41. Protocol violations were more frequent in the IMRT group (P < .001). Furthermore, the use of VMAT yielded better dosimetric results than IMRT for urethra planning-risk volume D98% (31.1 vs 30.8 Gy, P < .0001), PTV D2% (37.9 vs 38.7 Gy, P < .0001), homogeneity index (0.09 vs 0.10, P < .0001), Dice similarity coefficient (0.83 vs 0.80, P < .0001), and bladder wall V50% (24.5% vs 33.5%, P = .0001). To achieve its goals volumetric modulated arc therapy required fewer monitor units than IMRT (2275 vs 3378, P <.0001). The inclusion of SV in the PTV negatively affected the rectal wall V90% (9.1% vs 10.4%, P = .0003) and V80% (13.2% vs 15.7%, P = .0003).

Methods:   Using a population-based registry with longitudinal patient reported outcomes (the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database linked to Medicare Health Outcomes Survey), we analyzed Medicare Advantage patients diagnosed with cancer during 1998-2011, who completed surveys regarding HRQOL through 2013. 'Early Era' patients were treated during 1998-2003; 'Late Era' patients were treated during 2006-2011.

Objective:   To determine patients' perspective on adoption of telehealth as a response to the pandemic and its sustainability in the future.  Design, setting, and participants:   Following a COVID-19 outbreak, 101 patients with advanced genitourinary cancers are currently managed ""virtually"" for therapy administration at our tertiary care unit. They were surveyed about the current situation, and current and long-term employment of telehealth.  Intervention:   Rapid implementation of virtual patient management.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Patients' perception of anxiety of COVID-19 and cancer, perspective on telehealth measures as a reaction to the current COVID-19 pandemic, and long-term acceptance were used as outcomes. Wilcoxon matched-pair signed rank test, chi-square test, and Mann-Whitney U test were performed.  Results and limitations:   Of 101 patients, 92 answered the questionnaire, with 71 (77.2%) responding virtually by e-mail or phone call. Anxiety of cancer (6/10, interquartile range [IQR] 3-8) superseded that of COVID-19 (four/10, IQR 2-5.25, p<0.001), and patients oppose temporary treatment interruption. Of the patients, 66.0% perceive their susceptibility to COVID-19 as equal to or lower than the general population and 52.2% believe that COVID-19 will not affect their therapy. In future, patients (62.6%) prefer to maintain in-person appointments as opposed to complete remote care, but accept remote care during the pandemic (eight/10, IQR 5-9). Beyond the crisis, maintaining telehealth has low preference rates (four/10, IQR 2-7), with high acceptance for external laboratory controls (60.9%) and online visit management (48.9%), but lower acceptance for remote treatment planning including staging discussions (44.6%) and for referral to secondary care oncologists (17.4%).  Conclusions:   Despite the pandemic, cancer remains the key concern and patients are not willing to compromise on their treatment. Rapid implementation of telehealth is tolerated well during the need of social distancing, with a clear ""red line"" concerning changes in existing patient-physician relationships. Balancing future implementation of telehealth while considering patients' demand for personal relationships will ensure human dignity in uro-oncology.  Patient summary:   We queried patients with genitourinary cancers treated in an almost virtual setting following a local coronavirus outbreak. Acceptance of telehealth during the current situation is high; however, long-term implementation of the adapted services is less favored. We deduce that patient-physician relationship is crucial for cancer patients and needs to be balanced against measures for social distancing to forge the future management.""","""['Severin Rodler', 'Maria Apfelbeck', 'Gerald Bastian Schulz', 'Troya Ivanova', 'Alexander Buchner', 'Michael Staehler', 'Volker Heinemann', 'Christian Stief', 'Jozefina Casuscelli']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Uro-oncology in times of COVID-19: The available evidence and recommendations in the Indian scenario.', 'Lessons from the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: Will virtual patient management reshape uro-oncology in Germany?', 'The impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on elective paediatric otolaryngology outpatient services - An analysis of virtual outpatient clinics in a tertiary referral centre using the modified paediatric otolaryngology telemedicine satisfaction survey (POTSS).', 'The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Genitourinary Cancer Care: Re-envisioning the Future.', ""Telemedicine Online Visits in Urology During the COVID-19 Pandemic-Potential, Risk Factors, and Patients' Perspective."", ""The Impact on Urology Residents' Learning of Social Media and Web Technologies after the Pandemic: A Step Forward through the Sharing of Knowledge."", 'Translation and validation study of the Chinese version of the service user technology acceptability questionnaire.', 'Virtual medicine in urology: Is it here to stay?', 'Strategies for Improving Access to Cancer Services in Rural Communities: A Pre-implementation Study.', 'Oncological surgery follow-up and quality of life: meta-analysis.']"""

The Mediterranean-style dietary pattern (MED-diet) offers a plausible mechanism to mitigate CRF through reducing inflammation and improving body composition. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a 12-week MED-diet, compared to usual care, on CRF and quality of life in men with prostate cancer treated with ADT.  Methods:   Twenty-three men (65.9 ± 7.8 years; body mass index: 29.6 ± 2.7 kg/m2; ADT duration: 33.8 ± 35.6 months) receiving ADT for ≥3 months were randomly assigned (1:1) to 12-weeks of usual care or the MED-diet involving six individualised nutrition consults. Primary outcomes included CRF [Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue scale (FACIT-F) and quality of life [FACIT-General (FACIT-G)], secondary outcomes included body mass/composition and interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 concentrations measured at baseline, 8-weeks and 12 weeks. Intervention feasibility was measured by intervention safety, study completion rate, consult attendance, and adherence to the MED-diet through the Mediterranean-diet adherence screener (MEDAS). Intention to treat linear mixed models were used to determine changes in outcomes between the MED-diet and usual care at baseline, 8-weeks and 12-weeks.  Results:   The MED-diet improved CRF (FACIT-F) at 8-weeks [+4.8 (0.0, 9.8); P = 0.05] and 12-weeks [+7.2 (2.2, 12.0); P = 0.005], quality of life (FACIT-G) at 12-weeks [+9.2 (2.7, 15.8); P = 0.006], reduced total body mass at 8-weeks [-2.51 kg (-4.25, -0.78); P = 0.005] and 12-weeks [-2.97 kg (-4.71, -1.25); P = 0.001], lean mass at 8-weeks [-1.50 kg (-2.91, -0.10); P = 0.036], and IL-8 at 8-weeks [-0.18 ng/ml (-0.34, -0.02); P = 0.029] compared to usual care. The MED-diet demonstrated zero adverse events, 91% study completion, 100% attendance, and 81% adherence to the MEDAS.  Conclusion:   The MED-diet is safe and feasible, and has the potential to improve CRF and quality of life in overweight men treated with ADT compared to usual care.

Materials and methods:   A total of 132 consecutive men (median age, 70 years; IQR, 66-77 years) with rising PSA after prostate radiotherapy who underwent prostate MRI and biopsy in view of salvage treatment between January 2010 and July 2017 were retrospectively evaluated at a single center. MFS predictors were assessed with Cox models. Predictors of the volume of the local recurrence (number of invaded prostate sectors at biopsy) were assessed using Poisson regression among variables available at PSA relapse.  Results:   At multivariate analysis, an initial Gleason score≥8 (OR=7 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2-40]; P=0.03), a recent radiotherapy (OR=17 [95% CI: 3.9-72]; P<0.0001), the use of androgen deprivation therapy at PSA relapse (OR=12.5 [95% CI: 2.8-57]; P=0.001) and the number of invaded prostate sectors (OR=1.5 [95% CI: 1.1-2]; P=0.007) and maximum cancer core length (OR=0.7 [95%CI: 0.6-0.9]; P=0.002) at biopsy performed at PSA relapse were significant MFS predictors. The PSA level at relapse was significant independent predictor of the volume of local recurrence only when used as a continuous variable (P=0.0002) but not when dichotomized using the nadir+2 threshold (P=0.41).

This theranostic nanoformulation facilitates simultaneous delivery of chemotherapy and gene therapy, as well as a bimodal optical and magnetic resonance imaging agent that could enable image-guided combination therapy. Poly-d-lysine coated NaYF4; Yb20%, Er2%@NaYF4; Gd50% core@shell UCNPs are effective siRNA transfection agents, and Er3+ doping provides upconversion imaging capabilities, while Gd3+ doping enables magnetic resonance contrast enhancement. These properties are maintained upon encapsulation in PLGA-CS. PLGA-CS nanocarriers containing Doc and UCNP-siRNA are 235 ± 5 nm with a zeta potential of +17 ± 4 meV, and have a high Doc encapsulation efficiency of 57 ± 6%. Compared to free Doc, this PLGA-CS nanoformulation containing Doc and UCNP-siRNA exhibits a dramatic decrease in IC50 of ~14,000 fold (p < 0.001) through combination therapy in human PC-3 prostate cancer cells.

We report a case of gallbladder PGL presenting synchronously with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET) and pulmonary IgG4-related disease in a 74-year old male patient with disseminated prostate adenocarcinoma. Due to the high rate of germline mutations and the possible syndromal manifestation of PGLs as well as pancreatic NETs, this patient was offered genetic testing, and a pathogenic SDHA germline mutation was found. Immunohistochemically, there was loss of SDHA and SDHB in the PGL but neither in the NET nor in the prostate adenocarcinoma.

The compounds were obtained straightforwards via a two step pathway, starting from commercially available ethyl 2-aminooxazole-4-carboxylate or ethyl 2-aminothiazole-4-carboxylate. Biological evaluation showed that these hydroxamic acids generally exhibited good cytotoxicity against three human cancer cell lines (SW620, colon; PC-3, prostate; NCI-H23, lung cancer), with IC50 values in low micromolar range and comparable to that of SAHA. These compounds also comparably inhibited HDACs with IC50 values in sub-micromolar range (0.010-0.131 µM) and some compounds (e.g 5f, IC50, 0.010 µM) were even more potent than SAHA (IC50, 0.025 µM) in HDAC inhibition. Representative compounds 6a and 8a appeared to arrest the SW620 cell cycle at G2 phase and significantly induced both early and late apoptosis of SW620 colon cancer cells. Docking experiments on HDAC2 and HDAC6 isozymes revealed favorable interactions at the tunnel of the HDAC active site which positively contributed to the inhibitory activity of synthesized compound. The binding affinity predicted by docking program showed good correlation with the experimental IC50 values.

However, epidemiological studies of EBM are few in number and definition thresholds variable. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and causes of EBM in the general population referred to a single university hospital - catering for a population of 4 million inhabitants - for DXA scanning.  Material and methods:   DXA databases were initially searched for individuals with a bone mineral density (BMD) Z-score ≥+4 at any site in the lumbar spine or hip from April 1st, 2008 to April 30st, 2018. Two Hologic scanners were available at the Lille University Hospital (France). Prevalence of EBM was evaluated, as were causes associated with EBM.  Results:   At the lumbar spine, 18,229 bone density tests were performed in women and 10,209 in men. At the hip, 17,390 tests were performed in women and 9857 in men. The total number of patients who had at least one bone density test was 14,745, of which 64.2% were female. Of these 14,745 patients, 211 had a Z-score ≥+4 at any site, i.e. a prevalence of 1.43% [1.25%-1.64%]. The DXA scans and medical records of 92 men and 119 women with elevated BMD were reviewed to assess causes. An artefactual cause was found in 164 patients (75%) with EBM (mostly degenerative disease of the spine), and an acquired cause of focal EBM was found in only 2 patients, both of whom had sclerotic bone metastases from prostate cancer. An acquired cause of generalized EBM was found in 32 patients (15%), the vast majority of whom had renal osteodystrophy (n = 11), followed by hematological disorders (n = 9; e.g. myeloproliferative syndromes and mastocytosis) and diffuse bone metastases from solid cancer (n = 5). Of the remaining causes, rare hereditary diseases (e.g. osteopetrosis…) and unexplained EBM were found in 10 and 6 cases respectively.  Conclusion:   The prevalence of EBM (Z-score ≥+4 at any site) was 1.43% [1.25%-1.64%]. In nearly all instances (97.1%) the explanation for EBM could be found in the medical record and through conventional investigations. This study suggests that the main cause of EBM is degenerative disease of the spine. Further studies are needed to differentiate artefactual EBM from hereditary or acquired EBM, and to investigate unexplained EBM. Genetic testing may prove useful in elucidating rare unknown causes.""","""['Aurore Nottez', 'Sami Kolta', 'Georges Lion', 'Camille Ternynck', 'Isabelle Legroux-Gérot', 'Marie-Christine Vantyghem', 'Bernard Cortet', 'Julien Paccou']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Bone""","""['The French multicentre elevated bone mass study: prevalence and causes.', 'High bone mass in adults.', ""'Sink or swim': an evaluation of the clinical characteristics of individuals with high bone mass."", 'Idiopathic Acquired Osteosclerosis in a Middle-Aged Woman With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.', 'New explanation for autosomal dominant high bone mass: Mutation of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6.']"""

However, how AR activation controls alternative splicing is mostly unknown. Our objective was to define its role in the transcriptome-wide regulation of alternative splicing. Three human PCa models-LNCaP, LAPC4, and 22Rv1 cells-were treated with and without androgens, and RNA was purified for deep-sequencing analyses (RNA-seq). Several bioinformatic tools were then used to study alternative splicing. We demonstrate that in the absence of androgens, alternative splicing complexity is similar among AR-positive PCa cells, with 48 % of all transcripts having various levels of alternative splicing. We also describe alternative splicing differences among cell lines, such as specific splicing of AR, REST, TSC2, and CTBP1. Interestingly, AR activation changed the alternative splicing of thousands of genes in all the PCa cell lines tested. Overlap between AR-sensitive alternative splicing events revealed that genes linked to cell metabolism are major targets for this specific modulation. These genes encode metabolic enzymes such as the prostate-specific membrane antigen, encoded by FOLH1, and the malate dehydrogenase 1 (MDH1). Overall, our study presents a comprehensive analysis of the PCa cell transcriptome and its modulation by AR, revealing a significant enrichment of metabolic genes in this AR-dependent regulation of alternative splicing.""","""['Lucas Germain', 'Camille Lafront', 'Jolyane Beaudette', 'Raghavendra Tejo Karthik Poluri', 'Cindy Weidmann', 'Étienne Audet-Walsh']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['Investigation of androgen receptor-dependent alternative splicing has identified a unique subtype of lethal prostate cancer.', 'Identification of novel truncated androgen receptor (AR) mutants including unreported pre-mRNA splicing variants in the 22Rv1 hormone-refractory prostate cancer (PCa) cell line.', 'Identification of novel androgen-regulated pathways and mRNA isoforms through genome-wide exon-specific profiling of the LNCaP transcriptome.', 'Androgen receptor splice variants and prostate cancer: From bench to bedside.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Preclinical models of prostate cancer - modelling androgen dependency and castration resistance in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo.', 'Investigation of androgen receptor-dependent alternative splicing has identified a unique subtype of lethal prostate cancer.', 'A FACS-Free Purification Method to Study Estrogen Signaling, Organoid Formation, and Metabolic Reprogramming in Mammary Epithelial Cells.']"""

The purpose of this study is the development of a robust interactive segmentation method for accurate segmentation of the prostate from MR images.  Methods:   We propose an interactive segmentation method based on a graph convolutional network (GCN) to refine the automatically segmented results. An atrous multiscale convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder is proposed to learn representative features to obtain accurate segmentations. Based on the multiscale feature, a GCN block is presented to predict the prostate contour in both automatic and interactive manners. To preserve the prostate boundary details and effectively train the GCN, a contour matching loss is proposed. The performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated on 41 in-house MR subjects and 30 PROMISE12 test subjects.  Result:   The proposed method yields mean Dice similarity coefficients of 93.8 ± 1.2% and 94.4 ± 1.0% on our in-house and PROMISE12 datasets, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art segmentation methods.

Whether the resolution of hyperglycemia will lead to reduced risk of neoplasm in T2D remains uncertain. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to assess the association between glycemic control and incidence of neoplasm in T2D patients.  Methods:   Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in T2D with significant HbA1c reduction difference between intensive/active and standard/control groups plus follow-up ≥48 weeks were included and analyzed by fixed-effect models, random-effect model, and meta-regression analysis accordingly.  Results:   Overall, 52 studies were included. Compared with standard/control treatment, intensive/active treatment led to significantly greater HbA1c reduction from baseline (WMD = -0.51%, 95% CI, -0.55 to -0.46%, P < 0.001), but was not associated with a decreased incidence of neoplasm (OR = 0.99, 95% CI, 0.94-1.03, I2 = 2%) in T2D.

The aim of this study was to analyse patient-reported acceptance of FT and evaluate factors associated with treatment decision regret.  Methods:   52 patients who received focal high-intensity focused ultrasound for low- to intermediate-risk PCa between 2014 and 2019 within two prospective trials were eligible for a survey regarding PCa-related treatment regret and quality-of-life (Clark's scale) and the following potential predictors: sociodemographic variables, Charlson Comorbidity Index, subjective aging (AARC-10 SF), and general health-related quality-of-life (SF-12).

Design:   4 (recommendation statement about stopping screening)×(2; time) online survey-based randomised controlled trial.  Setting:   Australia.  Participants:   271 English-speaking participants, aged 65-90, screened for breast/prostate cancer at least once in past decade.  Interventions:   Time 1: participants read a scenario in which their general practitioner (GP) informed them about the potential benefits and harms of cancer screening, followed by double-blinded randomisation to one of four recommendation statements to stop screening: control ('this screening test would harm you more than benefit you'), health status ('your other health issues should take priority'), life expectancy framed positively ('this test would not help you live longer') and negatively ('you may not live long enough to benefit'). Time 2: in a follow-up scenario, the GP explained why guidelines changed over time (anchoring bias intervention).  Measures:   Primary outcomes: screening intention and cancer anxiety (10-point scale, higher=greater intention/anxiety), measured at both time points.  Secondary outcomes:   trust (in their GP, the information provided, the Australian healthcare system), decisional conflict and knowledge of the information presented.  Results:   271 participants' responses analysed. No main effects were found. However, screening intention was lower for the negatively framed life expectancy versus health status statement (6.0 vs 7.1, mean difference (MD)=1.1, p=0.049, 95% CI 0.0 to 2.2) in post hoc analyses. Cancer anxiety was lower for the negatively versus positively framed life expectancy statement (4.8 vs 5.8, MD=1.0, p=0.025, 95% CI 0.1 to 1.9).

A limitation of HIFU is the absence of a reliable tool to measure treatment effect intraoperatively. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has been shown to be a promising modality for assessing the extent and boundaries of tissue ablation. The aim of this study was to assess the value of CEUS immediately after focal HIFU.  Materials and methods:   Retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained registry including consecutive men undergoing focal HIFU (Focal One). Candidates for focal HIFU were treatment naive men with ≥10 years life expectancy, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤ 20 ng/ml, TNM primary tumor, regional lymph nodes, distant metastasis stage ≤ T2c N0 M0 with a multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) visible lesion concordant with histologically proven prostate cancer. CEUS evaluation was performed immediately at the end of the procedure. Based on the surgeon's estimation of CEUS imaging, re-HIFU was performed, followed by another CEUS evaluation. To test our hypothesis, the results of the CEUS were compared to the results of early mpMRI to rule out clinically significant cancer. The concordance between the 2 tests was measured using the Cohen's kappa. The best model including relevant predictors was calculated with CEUS or with mpMRI to determine their respective added value.  Results:   Of 66 men who underwent HIFU, 32 met eligibility criteria. Bifocal treatment was performed in 1 man, increasing the number of treated lesions to 33. Further ablation based on CEUS was delivered intraoperatively to 13 lesions (39%). The positive biopsy rate for clinically significant cancer in the treated zones was 30% (10/33). The negative predictive value of CEUS and early mpMRI was 71% (95% confidence interval: 59%-82%). Concordance between CEUS and mpMRI was significant with a 72.7% agreement (P = 0.001). The model with CEUS showed the best accuracy with an area under the curve of 0.881.  Conclusion:   CEUS has a higher added value compared to early mpMRI in ruling out clinically significant cancer after focal HIFU.

Using a prospective cohort study of 447 male BRCA2 PV carriers recruited in the UK and Ireland from 1998 to 2016, we estimated standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) compared with population incidences and assessed variation in risk by PV location. Carriers of PVs in the PCCR had a PCa SIR of 8.33 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.46-15.6) and were at a higher risk of PCa than carriers of other BRCA2 PVs (SIR = 3.31, 95% CI 1.97-5.57; hazard ratio = 2.34, 95% CI 1.09-5.03).

However, patients with diffuse bone involvement, diagnosed with a ""superscan"" by bone scintigraphy at baseline, were excluded due to a lack of efficacy and safety data. We therefore aimed to investigate the feasibility of LuPSMA in patients with diffuse bone marrow involvement on baseline PSMA-targeted positron emission tomography. The primary end points were prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response (Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 [PCWG3]), hematologic safety profile (Common Terminology Criteria for Common Adverse Events [CTCAE]), and overall survival. Secondary end points of quality of life (assessed with Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form questionnaires) and radiologic response (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]) were assessed. Through retrospective screening of databases, we identified 43 eligible patients across four centers worldwide who received 154 cycles of LuPSMA under clinical trials or compassionate access programs. Median baseline PSA was 1000 (interquartile range 431-2151) ng/ml. PSA decline of at least 50% at 12 wk was achieved in 22 (58%) patients, while median time to pain progression was 8.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.1-12.6) mo. Median overall survival was 11.6 (95% CI 8.8-14.3) mo. Objective response in nodal or visceral disease was reported in seven (39%) of 18 patients with RECIST measurable disease. Grade 3 anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia occurred in nine (22%), seven (17%), and three (8%) patients, respectively. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia was noticed in three (8%) patients. In conclusion, patients with diffuse bone marrow involvement demonstrated similar LuPSMA efficacy and safety to phase II evidence. Acceptable safety outcomes do not support exclusion of patients with a superscan from future LuPSMA treatment protocols.

When exposed to anticancer therapies, tumor cells may switch into a different histological subtype, such as the neuroendocrine phenotype which is associated with treatment failure and a poor prognosis. In this study, we demonstrated that long-term androgen signal depletion of prostate LNCaP cells induced a neuroendocrine phenotype followed by re-differentiation towards a ""stem-like"" state. LNCaP cells incubated for 30 days in charcoal-stripped medium or with the androgen receptor antagonist 2-hydroxyflutamide developed neuroendocrine morphology and increased the expression of the neuroendocrine markers βIII-tubulin and neuron specific enolase (NSE). When cells were incubated for 90 days in androgen-depleted medium, they grew as floating spheres and had enhanced expression of the stem cell markers CD133, ALDH1A1, and the transporter ABCB1A. Additionally, the pluripotent transcription factors Nanog and Oct4 and the angiogenic factor VEGF were up-regulated while the expression of E-cadherin was inhibited. Cell viability revealed that those cells were resistant to docetaxel and 2-hidroxyflutamide. Mechanistically, androgen depletion induced the decrease in AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) expression and activation and stabilization of the hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1α. Overexpression of AMPK in the stem-like cells decreased the expression of stem markers as well as that of HIF-1α and VEGF while it restored the levels of E-cadherin and PGC-1α. Most importantly, docetaxel sensitivity was restored in stem-like AMPK-transfected cells. Our model provides a new regulatory mechanism of prostate cancer plasticity through AMPK that is worth exploring.""","""['Belén G Sánchez', 'Alicia Bort', 'Diana Vara-Ciruelos', 'Inés Díaz-Laviada']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cells""","""['Neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate carcinoma: focusing on its pathophysiologic mechanisms and pathological features.', 'Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase alpha signaling is involved in androgen depletion-induced neuroendocrine differentiation of androgen-sensitive LNCaP human prostate cancer cells.', 'Isoform 1 of TPD52 (PC-1) promotes neuroendocrine transdifferentiation in prostate cancer cells.', 'Lineage plasticity-mediated therapy resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor mutations in carcinoma of the prostate: significance for endocrine therapy.', 'The Molecular Biology of Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: From the Past to the Future.', 'State-of-the-art therapeutic strategies for targeting cancer stem cells in prostate cancer.', 'Zinc finger protein‑like 1 is a novel neuroendocrine biomarker for prostate cancer.', 'Androgen Deprivation Freezes Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer Cells in a Reversible, Genetically Unstable Quasi-Apoptotic State, Bursting into Full Apoptosis upon Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibition.', 'Stem cells from a malignant rat prostate cell line generate prostate cancers in vivo: a model for prostate cancer stem cell propagated tumor growth.']"""

To further understand the antitumor mechanism of germacrone, we investigated the growth inhibitory effect of germacrone on the human prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 (androgen independent) and 22RV1 (androgen dependent).  Materials and methods:   Prostate cancer cells were cultured with different concentrations of germacrone, and cell viability was measured by MTT assay. The levels of proteins were measured by Western blotting. Cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. Images of autophagy-related protein staining were captured by fluorescence microscopy. Autophagic flux was assessed by detecting the LC3B-II level.  Results:   Our results indicated that germacrone treatment significantly inhibited cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 259 μM for PC-3 cells and 396.9 μM for 22RV1 cells. Germacrone-treated cells also exhibited induction of autophagy, as evidenced by elevated LC3B-II protein expression levels and punctuate patterns. Additionally, an autophagy inhibitor enhanced the growth inhibitory effect of germacrone. Moreover, the phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR was inhibited in germacrone-treated prostate cancer cells.

However, the roles of CDCP1 in cervical cancer (CC) still remain elusive.  Materials and methods:   Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting were used to confirm the expression of CDCP1 in CC tissues compared with matched non-tumor tissues. In vitro, gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies were used to investigate the biological function and underlying mechanism of CDCP1 in cervical carcinogenesis. Furthermore, tumor growth was evaluated using a xenogenous subcutaneously implant model of CC cells in vivo.  Results:   Here, we confirmed that CDCP1 was significantly increased in human CC both in mRNA and in protein levels compared to normal cervical tissues. Furthermore, we demonstrated that increased CDCP1 expression promotes proliferation, migration, invasion and mediates the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype in HeLa and C33A cells. Also, CDCP1 knockdown reverses all the effects of enhanced CDCP1 on cell behavior in SiHa and Caski cells. Importantly, the suppressive expression of CDCP1 repressed tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model of CC.  Conclusion:   In summary, our current study results provide novel insights into the role of CDCP1 in CC progression. Potentially, CDCP1 might serve as a diagnostic biomarker and a novel therapeutic target for CC.""","""['Lijun Huang#', 'Yihong Chen#', 'Shuyu Lai', 'Hongmei Guan', 'Xiaoling Hu', 'Jie Liu', 'Hanrong Zhang', 'Zhenfei Zhang', 'Jueyu Zhou']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Manag Res""","""['Myosin 1b promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in cervical cancer.', 'Aberrantly enhanced melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE)-A3 expression facilitates cervical cancer cell proliferation and metastasis via actuating Wnt signaling pathway.', 'CUB-domain containing protein 1 represses the epithelial phenotype of pancreatic cancer cells.', 'Roles of CUB domain-containing protein 1 signaling in cancer invasion and metastasis.', 'CDCP1: A promising diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for human cancer.', 'Molecular mechanism by which CDCP1 promotes proneural-mesenchymal transformation in primary glioblastoma.', 'hsa_circ_0005358 suppresses cervical cancer metastasis by interacting with PTBP1 protein to destabilize CDCP1 mRNA.']"""

However, the expression profile and precise functions of miR-939 in prostate cancer (PCa) are still unclear. This study aimed to determine miR-939 expression in PCa and explore its roles in PCa tumorigenesis.  Methods:   miR-939 expression was determined in PCa tissues and cell lines using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation, and flow cytometric assays were used to determine the role of miR-939 in PCa cell proliferation and apoptosis in vitro, whereas a tumor xenograft model was generated to evaluate the effect of miR-939 on tumor growth in vivo. Transwell assays were performed to investigate whether miR-939 affects the migration and invasiveness of PCa cells.  Results:   miR-939 was found to be downregulated in PCa tissues and cell lines, and this downregulation was significantly correlated with tumor stage and lymphatic metastasis. Patients with PCa exhibiting low miR-939 expression had shorter overall survival than those exhibiting high miR-939 expression. Exogenous miR-939 expression suppressed PCa cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion in vitro; enhanced apoptosis in vitro; and decreased tumor growth in vivo. Investigation of the underlying molecular mechanisms revealed hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) as a direct target gene of miR-939 in PCa. HDGF was found to be significantly upregulated in PCa tissues, and its expression was inversely correlated with miR-939 expression. HDGF silencing and miR-939 upregulation showed similar effects in PCa. Restored HDGF expression counteracted the tumor-suppressive activity of miR-939 overexpression in PCa cells. Furthermore, ectopic miR-939 expression inhibited the WNT/β-catenin pathway activation in PCa both in vitro and in vivo by downregulating HDGF.  Conclusion:   miR-939 functions as a tumor suppressor during PCa tumorigenesis by directly targeting HDGF and deactivating the WNT/β-catenin pathway, suggesting the miR-939/HDGF/WNT/β-catenin pathway as an effective target for PCa therapy.""","""['Jie Situ#', 'Hao Zhang#', 'Zi Jin', 'Ke Li', 'Yunhua Mao', 'Wentao Huang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Onco Targets Ther""","""['MicroRNA-939 Directly Targets HDGF to Inhibit the Aggressiveness of Prostate Cancer via Deactivation of the WNT/β-Catenin Pathway Retraction.', 'Long Noncoding RNA LIPE-AS1 Drives Prostate Cancer Progression by Functioning as a Competing Endogenous RNA for microRNA-654-3p and Thereby Upregulating Hepatoma-Derived Growth Factor.', 'MiR-129-5p exerts Wnt signaling-dependent tumor-suppressive functions in hepatocellular carcinoma by directly targeting hepatoma-derived growth factor HDGF.', 'miR-1303 promotes the proliferation, migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells through regulating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by targeting DKK3.', 'Long Noncoding RNA SOX2-OT Knockdown Inhibits Proliferation and Metastasis of Prostate Cancer Cells Through Modulating the miR-452-5p/HMGB3 Axis and Inactivating Wnt/β-Catenin Pathway.', 'miR-874: An Important Regulator in Human Diseases.', 'Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction pathway in prostate cancer and associated drug resistance.', 'LINC01207 promotes prostate cancer progression by sponging miR-1182 to upregulate AKT3.', 'Splice and Dice: Intronic microRNAs, Splicing and Cancer.', 'Overexpression of microRNA-939-5p Contributes to Cell Proliferation and Associates Poor Prognosis in Glioma.', 'Identification of Urinary Exosomal miRNAs for the Non-Invasive Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer.']"""

However, why KLF5 loss is associated with prostate cancer aggressiveness is still not clear. Herein, we analyzed KLF5 expression in TCGA and GEO database, as well as prostate cancer tissue microarray, and found that KLF5 expression significantly decreased in prostate cancer accompanying with tumor progression; moreover, KLF5 downregulation was associated with shorter survival of patients. Interestingly, we also found that KLF5 expression was obviously lower in prostate cancer metastases than in localized tissues, indicating that KLF5 downregulation is associated with prostate cancer invasion and metastasis. To assess this effect of KLF5, we knocked down KLF5 in prostate cancer cells and found that KLF5 knockdown promoted invasive ability of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we found that KLF5 downregulation enhanced the expression of IGF1 and STAT3 phosphorylation, while block of IGF1 with antibody decreased the enhancement of STAT3 activity and prostate cancer cell invasive ability by KLF5 knockdown, indicating that KLF5 inhibits prostate cancer invasion through suppressing IGF1/STAT3 pathway. Mechanistically, we found that KLF5 interacted with deacetylase HDAC1 and KLF5 is necessary for the binding of HDAC1 on IGF1 promoter to suppress IGF1 transcription. Taken together, our results indicate that KLF5 could be an important suppressor of prostate cancer invasion and metastasis, because KLF5 could suppress the transcription of IGF1, a tumor cell autocrine cytokine, and its downstream cell signaling to inhibit cell invasive ability, and reveal a novel mechanism for STAT3 activation in prostate cancer.

Palmitic acid decreased the secretion of exosomes in human prostate cancer cells in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner. At the same time, the content of some prospective metastatic markers in the secreted exosomal fraction was also reduced, as was the ability of the cells to invade across extracellular matrix barriers. While by themselves our in vitro results imply that on the cell level, palmitic acid may be beneficial vis-à-vis the course of the disease, they also suggest that, by virtue of the decreased biomarker secretion, palmitic acid has the potential to cause unjustified deprioritization of treatment in obese and lipidemic men.""","""['Ivan V Maly', 'Wilma A Hofmann']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Molecules""","""['Palmitic acid inhibits prostate cancer cell proliferation and metastasis by suppressing the PI3K/Akt pathway.', 'Myosin isoform expressed in metastatic prostate cancer stimulates cell invasion.', 'Exosome carrying PSGR promotes stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of low aggressive prostate cancer cells.', 'Recent Advances in Experimental Models of Breast Cancer Exosome Secretion, Characterization and Function.', 'Role of Exosomes in Prostate Cancer Metastasis.', 'Selective effects of estradiol on human corneal endothelial cells.', 'Effect of Physiological Oxygen on Primary Human Corneal Endothelial Cell Cultures.', 'Combination of Palmitic Acid and Methylseleninic Acid Induces Mitochondria-Dependent Apoptosis via Attenuation of the IRE1α Arm and Enhancement of CHOP in Hepatoma.', 'An Examination of the Putative Role of Melatonin in Exosome Biogenesis.']"""

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents almost 90% of primary liver cancer and has become a major health problem globally. Cardamonin (CADMN) is a natural bioactive chalcone found in several edible plants such as cardamom and Alpinia species. Previous studies have shown that CADMN possesses anticancer activities against breast, lung, prostate and colorectal cancer. In the present study, the mechanisms underlying the anti-hepatocellular carcinoma effects of CADMN were investigated against HepG2 cells. The results demonstrated that CADMN has anti-proliferative effects and apoptotic action on HepG2 cells. CADMN showed potent cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells with an IC50 of 17.1 ± 0.592 μM at 72 h. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that CADMN arrests HepG2 cells in G1 phase and induces a significant increase in early and late apoptosis in a time-dependent manner. The mechanism by which CADMN induces apoptotic action was via activation of both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Moreover, the findings of this study showed the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which inhibit the NF-κB pathway and further enhance the apoptotic process. Together, our findings further support the potential anticancer activity of CADMN as an alternative therapeutic agent against HCC.""","""['Nassrin A Badroon', 'Nazia Abdul Majid', 'Mohammed A Alshawsh']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Nutrients""","""['Mechanisms underlying isoliquiritigenin-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest via ROS-mediated MAPK/STAT3/NF-κB pathways in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells.', 'Liquiritin inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells via the ROS-mediated MAPK/AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway.', 'Millepachine, a novel chalcone, induces G2/M arrest by inhibiting CDK1 activity and causing apoptosis via ROS-mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in human hepatocarcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'Comment on: an orally antitumor chalcone hybrid inhibited HepG2 cells growth and migration as the tubulin binding agent.', 'Molecular mechanisms underlying chemopreventive potential of butein: Current trends and future perspectives.', 'Inhibitory effect of lingonberry extract on HepG2 cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion.', 'Emerging roles of cardamonin, a multitargeted nutraceutical in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases.', 'Anticancer Activity of Natural and Synthetic Chalcones.', 'Chalcone Derivatives: Role in Anticancer Therapy.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Antiproliferative Effects of Natural Chalcones.']"""

Methods:   Eight olives embedded in gelatin, each simulating a prostate, underwent MRI. Three virtual spherical lesions (3, 5, and 8 mm diameters) were marked in each olive on the MRI images and co-registered to the MRI/Transrectal Ultrasonography (TRUS) fusion biopsy system. Two radiologists placed 0.5 mm fiducials, targeting the center of each virtual lesion under fusion image guidance. Half of the 8 olives in each phantom were assigned either to the 1-seed or 2-seeds per lesion strategy. Post-procedure Computed Tomography (CT) images identified each seed and were fused with MR to localize each virtual lesion and collected the seed placement error - distance between the virtual target and the corresponding seed (using the closer seed for the 2-seed strategy). Seed placement success is defined as fiducial placement within a lesion boundary.  Results:   Each operator repeated the procedure on three different phantoms, and data from 209 seeds placed for 137 lesions were analyzed, with an overall error of 3.03 ± 1.52 mm. The operator skill, operator phantom procedural experience, lesion size, and number of seeds, were independently associated with the seed placement error. Seed placement success rate was higher for the 2-seed group compared to 1-seed, although the difference was not statistically significant.

However, low signal-to-noise ratio and high variability of prostate anatomic structures are challenging for its segmentation using DWI. We propose a semi-automated framework that segments the prostate gland and its zones simultaneously using DWI.  Methods:   In this paper, the Chan-Vese active contour model along with morphological opening operation was used for segmentation of prostate gland. Then segmentation of prostate zones into peripheral zone (PZ) and transition zone (TZ) was carried out using in-house developed probabilistic atlas with partial volume (PV) correction algorithm. The study cohort included MRI dataset of 18 patients (n = 18) as our dataset and methodology were also independently evaluated using 15 MRI scans (n = 15) of QIN-PROSTATE-Repeatability dataset. The atlas for zones of prostate gland was constructed using dataset of twelve patients of our patient cohort. Three-fold cross-validation was performed with 10 repetitions, thus total 30 instances of training and testing were performed on our dataset followed by independent testing on the QIN-PROSTATE-Repeatability dataset. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Jaccard coefficient (JC), and accuracy were used for quantitative assessment of the segmentation results with respect to boundaries delineated manually by an expert radiologist. A paired t-test was performed to evaluate the improvement in zonal segmentation performance with the proposed PV correction algorithm.  Results:   For our dataset, the proposed segmentation methodology produced improved segmentation with DSC of 90.76 ± 3.68%, JC of 83.00 ± 5.78%, and accuracy of 99.42 ± 0.36% for the prostate gland, DSC of 77.73 ± 2.76%, JC of 64.46 ± 3.43%, and accuracy of 82.47 ± 2.22% for the PZ, and DSC of 86.05 ± 1.50%, JC of 75.80 ± 2.10%, and accuracy of 91.67 ± 1.56% for the TZ. The segmentation performance for QIN-PROSTATE-Repeatability dataset was, DSC of 85.50 ± 4.43%, JC of 75.00 ± 6.34%, and accuracy of 81.52 ± 5.55% for prostate gland, DSC of 74.40 ± 1.79%, JC of 59.53 ± 8.70%, and accuracy of 80.91 ± 5.16% for PZ, and DSC of 85.80 ± 5.55%, JC of 74.87 ± 7.90%, and accuracy of 90.59 ± 3.74% for TZ. With the implementation of the PV correction algorithm, statistically significant (p<0.05) improvements were observed in all the metrics (DSC, JC, and accuracy) for both prostate zones, PZ and TZ segmentation.  Conclusions:   The proposed segmentation methodology is stable, accurate, and easy to implement for segmentation of prostate gland and its zones (PZ and TZ).

Recently, metastasis-directed therapy (MDT) has emerged as a potential intermediary between surveillance and immediate continuous ADT. Simultaneously, advanced systemic therapy in addition to ADT has also been shown to improve survival in metastatic hormone-sensitive disease. This study aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of treating oligorecurrent patients with upfront MDT before standard-of-care systemic therapy.  Methods and materials:   A Markov-based cost-effectiveness analysis was constructed comparing 3 strategies: (1) upfront MDT → salvage abiraterone acetate plus prednisone (AAP) + ADT → salvage docetaxel + ADT; (2) upfront AAP + ADT → salvage docetaxel + ADT; and (3) upfront docetaxel + ADT → salvage AAP + ADT. Transition probabilities and utilities were derived from the literature. Using a 10-year time horizon and willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY), net monetary benefit values were subsequently calculated for each treatment strategy.  Results:   At 10 years, the base case revealed a total cost of $141,148, $166,807, and $136,154 with QALYs of 4.63, 4.89, and 4.00, respectively, reflecting a net monetary benefit of $322,240, $322,018, and $263,407 for upfront MDT, upfront AAP + ADT, and upfront docetaxel + ADT, respectively. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis using a Monte Carlo simulation (1,000,000 simulations), upfront MDT was the cost-effective strategy in 53.6% of simulations. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed 95% confidence intervals for cost ($75,914-$179,862, $124,431-$223,892, and $103,298-$180,617) and utility in QALYs (3.85-6.12, 3.91-5.86, and 3.02-5.22) for upfront MDT, upfront AAP + ADT, and upfront docetaxel + ADT, respectively.  Conclusions:   At 10 years, upfront MDT followed by salvage AAP + ADT, is comparably cost-effective compared with upfront standard-of-care systemic therapy and may be considered a viable treatment strategy, especially in patients wishing to defer systemic therapy for quality-of-life or comorbidity concerns.

Our previous studies demonstrated that cabazitaxel (CBZ) (second-generation Food and Drug Administration-approved taxane chemotherapy), used for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), causes reversal of EMT to mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) and reduces expression of kinesin motor protein KIFC1 (HSET). The present study examined the effect of sequencing CBZ chemotherapy mediated MET on prostate tumor redifferentiation overcoming therapeutic resistance in models of advanced prostate cancer.  Methods:   To examine the impact of androgens on the antitumor effect of CBZ, we used human prostate cancer cell lines with different sensitivity to androgens and CBZ, in vitro, and two human prostate cancer xenograft models in vivo. Tumor-bearing male mice (with either the androgen-sensitive LNCaP or the CRPC 22Rv1 xenografts) were treated with CBZ (3 mg/kg) alone, or in combination with castration-induced androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) for 14 days.  Results:   Cell viability assays indicate that the presence of 5α-dihydrotestosterone (1 nM) confers resistance to CBZ in vitro. CBZ treatment in vivo induced MET in LNCaP-derived tumors as shown by increased E-cadherin and decreased N-cadherin levels. Sequencing CBZ after ADT improves tumor response in androgen-sensitive LNCaP, but not in CRPC 22Rv1 xenografts. Mechanistic dissection revealed a novel association between the androgen receptor and HSET in prostate cancer cells that is inhibited by CBZ in an androgen-dependent manner.  Conclusions:   Our findings provide new insights into the phenotypic reprogramming of prostate cancer cells to resensitize tumors to CBZ action. This evidence is of translational significance in treatment sequencing (CBZ and ADT) towards improved therapeutic benefit in patients with lethal CRPC.""","""['Diane Begemann', 'Yang Wang', 'Wei Yang', 'Natasha Kyprianou']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Marked response to cabazitaxel in prostate cancer xenografts expressing androgen receptor variant 7 and reversion of acquired resistance by anti-androgens.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Multinucleation and Mesenchymal-to-Epithelial Transition Alleviate Resistance to Combined Cabazitaxel and Antiandrogen Therapy in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Preclinical efficacy of growth hormone-releasing hormone antagonists for androgen-dependent and castration-resistant human prostate cancer.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal-transition regulators in prostate cancer: Androgens and beyond.', 'Impact of Circadian Rhythms on the Development and Clinical Management of Genitourinary Cancers.', 'Functional Implication of Exosomal miR-217 and miR-23b-3p in the Progression of Prostate Cancer.']"""

To account for its dismal prognosis and to omit basal cell immunohistochemistry, it has been proposed to grade IDC on the basis of its underlying architectural pattern. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of IDC grade assignment on prostate cancer biopsy and radical prostatectomy tumour grading.  Methods and results:   A cohort of 1031 prostate cancer biopsies and 835 radical prostatectomies were assigned a Grade Group according to the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology guidelines, without incorporation of IDC in grading. Tumour grading was compared with a Grade Group in which IDC was graded on the basis of its underlying architecture. Of 1031 biopsies, 139 (13.5%) showed IDC. Grade assignment of IDC led to a Grade Group change in 17 (1.6%) cases: four of 486 (0.8%) Grade Group 1 cases were reclassified as Grade Group 2, nine of 375 (2.4%) Grade Group 2 cases were reclassified as Grade Group 3, and four of 58 (6.9%) Grade Group 4 cases were reclassified as Grade Group 5. IDC was observed in 213 of 835 (25.5%) radical prostatectomies, and its grading led to a change in tumour grade in five of 835 (0.6%) patients, with upgrading in two of 207 (1.0%) patients with Grade Group 1 cancer, in two of 420 (0.5%) patients with Grade Group 2 cancer, and in one of 50 (2%) patients with Grade Group 4 cancer.  Conclusion:   IDC grade assignment led to a Grade Group change in 1.6% of prostate biopsy specimens and in 0.6% of radical prostatectomy specimens.

Methods:   The suppression by Res of the growth of PCa cells was verified through a cytotoxicity assay. In addition, the effects of Res on 5-methylcytosine (5mC), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), and ten-eleven translocation 1 (TET1) levels were assessed, and the cell migration and invasion were also determined. The expressions of TET1, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) 2, TIMP3, MMP2, and MMP9 were detected through Western blot analysis. Afterward, TET1 was silenced using lentiviral short hairpin RNA to examine the effect of TET1 on the Res-triggered inhibition of migration and invasion of PCa cells.  Results:   Our results showed that Res upregulated the 5hmC and TET1 levels and downregulated the 5mC level. Moreover, Res also inhibited the migration and invasion of PCa cells, promoted the demethylation of TIMP2 and TIMP3 to upregulate their expressions, and suppressed the expressions of MMP2 and MMP9. The silencing of TET1 in the presence of Res showed that Res could exert its effect through TET1.

To examine the effects of a single dose of zoledronic acid on bone microarchitecture, we conducted a 2-year randomized placebo controlled trial in 76 men, mean age (interquartile range [IQR]) 67.8 years (63.8 to 73.9) with non-metastatic prostate cancer commencing adjuvant ADT; 39 were randomized to zoledronic acid and 37 to matching placebo. Bone microarchitecture was measured using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). Using a mixed model, mean adjusted differences (MAD; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]) between the groups are reported as the treatment effect at several time points. Over 24 months, zoledronic acid showed no appreciable treatment effect on the primary outcomes for total volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD); radius (6.7 mg HA/cm3 [-2.0 to 15.4], p = 0.21) and tibia (1.9 mg HA/cm3 [-3.3 to 7.0], p = 0.87). Similarly, there were no between-group differences in other measures of microarchitecture, with the exception of a modest effect of zoledronic acid over placebo in total cortical vBMD at the radius over 12 months (17.3 mgHA/cm3 [5.1 to 29.5]). In contrast, zoledronic acid showed a treatment effect over 24 months on areal bone mineral density (aBMD) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at all sites, including lumbar spine (0.10 g/cm2 [0.07 to 0.13]), p < 0.001), and total hip (0.04 g/cm2 [0.03 to 0.05], p < 0.001). Bone remodeling markers were initially suppressed in the treatment group then increased but remained lower relative to placebo (MADs at 24 months CTX -176 ng/L [-275 to -76], p < 0.001; P1NP -18 mg/L [-32 to -5], p < 0.001).

The CXC-chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) contributes to inflammation. We evaluated the expression of inflammatory cytokines in clinical specimens, primary cultures, and prostatic lineage cell lines. We investigated whether IL-8 via its receptor system (IL-8 axis) promotes BPH.  Methods:   The messenger RNA and protein expression of chemokines, including components of the IL-8 axis, were measured in normal prostate (NP; n = 7) and BPH (n = 21), urine (n = 24) specimens, primary cultures, prostatic lineage epithelial cell lines (NHPrE1, BHPrE1, BPH-1), and normal prostate cells (RWPE-1). The functional role of the IL-8 axis in prostate epithelial cell growth was evaluated by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. The effect of a combination with two natural compounds, oleanolic acid (OA) and ursolic acid (UA), was evaluated on the expression of the IL-8 axis and epithelial cell growth.  Results:   Among the 19 inflammatory chemokines and chemokine receptors we analyzed, levels of IL-8 and its receptors (CXCR1, CXCR2), as well as, of CXCR7, a receptor for CXCL12, were 5- to 25-fold elevated in BPH tissues when compared to NP tissues (P ≤ .001). Urinary IL-8 levels were threefold to sixfold elevated in BPH patients, but not in asymptomatic males and females with lower urinary tract symptoms (P ≤ .004). The expression of the IL-8 axis components was confined to the prostate luminal epithelial cells in both normal and BPH tissues. However, these components were elevated in BPH-1 and primary explant cultures as compared to RWPE-1, NHPrE1, and BHPrE1 cells. Knockout of CXCR7 reduced IL-8, and CXCR1 expression by 4- to 10-fold and caused greater than or equal to 50% growth inhibition in BPH-1 cells. Low-dose OA + UA combination synergistically inhibited the growth of BPH-1 and BPH primary cultures. In the combination, the drug reduction indices for UA and OA were 16.4 and 7852, respectively, demonstrating that the combination was effective in inhibiting BPH-1 growth at significantly reduced doses of UA or OA alone.  Conclusion:   The IL-8 axis is a promotor of BPH pathogenesis.

The treatment, however, is associated with a host of side effects including depression. Managing the psychological wellbeing of prostate cancer patients is important for maximizing their survival outcomes. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate depressive symptomatology in patients with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) compared with that in patients who underwent prostatectomy and to explore the factors that affect depressive symptoms, which might occur during ADT.  Methods:   One hundred and seven patients undergoing ADT (ADT group) and prostatectomy (Operation group) were enrolled. Adjustments were made for differences in characteristics between groups using a propensity score model with stabilized weights before treatment. Depressive symptoms between groups were compared using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) before treatment and six months after treatment initiation. To identify factors affecting depressive symptoms during ADT, multivariate regression analysis was performed on the mean change in BDI score, age, body mass index, testosterone level, prostate-specific antigen level, the international index of erectile function (IIEF), and the Gleason score.  Results:   The BDI score significantly increased in the ADT group compared to the operation group six months after treatment initiation (p < 0.001). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that before ADT, the BDI score was higher by 0.446 according to the IIEF. During ADT, the BDI score increased by 1.579 according to changes in BMI (p = 0.021) and decreased by 0.01 according to changes in testosterone levels (p = 0.034).  Conclusion:   Depressive symptoms can be exacerbated in prostate cancer patients undergoing ADT.

Is it possible to show their metabolic activity and thus the grade of inflammatory burden with 18F-Fluorocholine PET/CT?""","""The recent outbreak of Covid-19 has represented a major challenge for the countries affected by the disease, not only in terms of loss of human life, economic downturn, and constraint on individual freedom, but also for the great pressure on the national health systems and hospitals. The 380 kDa virus has been a perfect storm, especially for those national health systems used to working with limited resources and high intensity rhythms, such as Italy. For the first time in the new century, a virtually unknown fast-spreading disease has caused a public health emergency thus forcing most countries to deal with an insurmountable logistic gap. Hence, every branch of Medicine, even though not directly involved in the treatment, has been called upon to provide its contribution to resolve the crisis. It is now becoming more apparent that Covid-19 is not solely a lung disease, but a complex systemic disease involving several organs and systems. This is due to an abnormal inflammatory response which eventually leads to multisystemic coagulopathy which mainly, but not uniquely, targets the lungs. Although the pathophysiology of this syndrome is still not fully understood, macrophages and their immune complex system seem to play a key role. It is not yet clear why some patients develop the violent immune response which results in pneumonitis while others do not. There are clues indicating that the systemic hyper-inflammation defined as macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), or cytokine storm, requires an increase in choline consumption to synthesize phosphatidylcholine and stimulate phagocytosis, organelle biogenesis, secretory functions, and endocytosis. 18F-Fluorocholine is a synthetic analog of the naturally occurring choline normally used for PET/CT imaging of prostate cancer patients. 18F-Fluorocholine could image and quantify the macrophage activity in pulmonary interstitial infiltrates of Covid-19 pneumonia. If the hypothesis is confirmed experimentally, 18F-Fluorocholine PET/CT could be used to in vivo image and quantify the degree of lung inflammation and potentially stratify the gravity of this disease.""","""['G Savelli', 'M Bonacina', 'A Rizzo', 'A Zaniboni']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Hypotheses""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Clinical utility of (18)F-fluorocholine positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in biochemical relapse of prostate cancer after radical treatment: results of a multicentre study.', 'Incidental Findings Suggestive of COVID-19 in Asymptomatic Patients Undergoing Nuclear Medicine Procedures in a High-Prevalence Region.', 'State of the art of PET/CT with 11-choline and 18F-fluorocholine in the diagnosis and follow-up of localized and locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases with 18F-NaF and 18F-Fluorocholine PET/CT.', 'Research progress on anti-ovarian cancer mechanism of miRNA regulating tumor microenvironment.', 'Oncology and cardiology positron emission tomography/computed tomography faced with COVID-19: A review of available literature data.', 'COVID-19 Pneumonia was Incidentally Detected on 18F-Fluorocholine PET/CT in a Work-up for Prostate Cancer.', 'COVID-19 vaccination simulating lymph node progression in a patient with prostate cancer.', 'Radiological Characteristics of Patients With Anti-MDA5-Antibody-Positive Dermatomyositis in 18F-FDG PET/CT: A Pilot Study.']"""

Objective:   To assess the role of HOXB13 mRNA expression in PCa progression following radical prostatectomy.  Design, setting, and participants:   Genome-wide expression profiles were queried from two retrospective prostatectomy cohorts with follow-up data (Mayo Clinic, n=780; Johns Hopkins Medical Institute [JHMI], n=355), and a prospective genomic registry (n=5239).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Multivariable Cox regressions were used to analyze metastasis-free survival (MFS).  Results and limitations:   HOXB13 expression in primary PCa increased with increasing tumor grade and with high metastatic potential based on a genomic signature. The highest quartile of HOXB13 expression was associated with worse MFS compared with the lowest quartile (Mayo Clinic: adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 1.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-2.06, and JHMI: AHR 1.80, 95% CI 1.02-3.19). The combinations of high HOXB13 expression and low expression of its binding partner, MEIS1 (AHR 2.03, 95% CI 1.54-2.66) or MEIS2 (AHR 1.73, 95% CI 1.33-2.26), portended worse MFS. Additionally, high HOXB13 expression in combination with low MEIS1/2 expression correlated with high expression of androgen receptor-mediated genes. The retrospective nature of this study subjects the findings to a bias due to unmeasured variables.  Conclusions:   Primary PCa tumors with increased HOXB13 expression have an increased propensity for metastases following prostatectomy, particularly in the setting of low MEIS1/2 expression. High androgen receptor output may account for worse outcomes for these tumors and suggests heightened sensitivity to androgen suppression.  Patient summary:   Using genomic data from a large number of prostate cancer (PCa) tumors, we found that increased expression of homeobox B13 (HOXB13), a gene related to normal prostate development, was associated with worse outcomes following surgery for PCa. A biomarker signature suggests that these tumors would be more susceptible to androgen suppression, a common treatment for PCa.

However, many aspects of the impact of T2DM, particularly the duration of T2DM and antidiabetic medications, on PCa risk are poorly understood.  Methods:   To assess the association of duration of T2DM and antidiabetic medication with PCa risk, we designed a matched case-control study, including 31,415 men with PCa and 154,812 PCa-free men in Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden (PCBaSe) 4.1.  Results:   Overall, a decreased risk of PCa was observed for men with T2DM (odds ratio (OR): 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.78-0.84), as compared to men without T2DM. The decreased risk of PCa was consistently showed across duration of T2DM. With respect to use of antidiabetic drugs, this inverse association with duration was also found for all medications types, as compared to men without T2DM, including insulin, metformin and sulphonylurea (SU) (e.g. 3- < 5 yr insulin OR:0.69, 95%CI:0.60-0.80; 3- < 5 yr metformin OR: 0.82, 95%CI: 0.74-0.91; 3- < 5 yr SU OR: 0.72, 95%CI: 0.62-0.83). When stratifying by PCa risk categories, this decreased risk was most evident for diagnosis of low and intermediate-risk PCa (low-risk OR: 0.65, 95%CI: 0.66-0.70, intermediate-risk OR: 0.80, 95%CI: 0.75-0.85).  Conclusions:   The study showed an inverse association between pre-existing T2DM and PCa across different durations of T2DM and all types of T2DM medication received. This inverse association was most evident for low- and intermediate-risk PCa, suggesting that whilst T2DM and its medication may protect some men from developing PCa, the relationship warrants further study.""","""['E Lin', 'Hans Garmo', 'Mieke Van Hemelrijck', 'Jan Adolfsson', 'Pär Stattin', 'Björn Zethelius', 'Danielle Crawley']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Does a prostate cancer diagnosis affect management of pre-existing diabetes?

Its successful treatment greatly relies on the early diagnose. Engrailed-2 (EN2) has been confirmed being existed with a high level in the urine of PC patients. In this study, to explore the application of EN2 in PC, we detected the immunohistochemical staining difference and EN2 expression level between benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and PC.  Methods:   We developed a monoclonal antibody against the helix 3 in EN2 and confirmed its specificity with Western blotting (WB) and immunofluorescence detecting the subcellular localization of endogenous and exogenous EN2 in three PC cell lines (LNCap, PC3, and DU145). We conducted immunohistochemical staining using this homemade antibody, and RT-PCR to detect the expression of EN2 in 25 PC and 25 BPH cases, and analyzed the correlation of EN2 expression and PC clinical staging.  Results:   The results of WB and immunofluorescence showed our homemade EN2 monoclonal antibody could specifically bind endogenous and exogenous EN2 protein in three different PC cell lines. Endogenous EN2 was generally expressed in the cytoplasm and exogenous EN2 mostly existed in the nucleus of these cell lines. Immunohistochemical staining in PC had extremely stronger signals than that in BPH, suggesting a higher EN2 expression level in PC, which was confirmed by RT-PCR. Interestingly, the stained areas in BPH tissues were mainly in nucleus and cytoplasm, while in PC tissues were mainly on cytomembrane. Moreover, the expression level of EN2 was positively correlated with the PC clinical staging.  Conclusion:   Using our homemade EN2 antibody, we have found different staining patterns and expression level of EN2 in BPH and PC,which may be helpful to predict prostatic disease progression.""","""['Qi Li', 'Yibo Shi', 'Rigai Sa', 'Jun Hao', 'Jinhao Hu', 'Mulun Xiao', 'Chaoliang Wang', 'Liang Yan', 'Baoping Qiao', 'Guoxun Chen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Engrailed-2 (EN2): a tumor specific urinary biomarker for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Expression of c-kit and kit-ligand in benign and malignant prostatic tissues.', 'Is Engrailed-2 (EN2) a truly promising biomarker in prostate cancer detection?', 'EN2 in Prostate Cancer.', 'Immunohistochemistry in diagnostic surgical pathology of the prostate.', 'Effect of Bicalutamide Combined with Docetaxel on Serum PSA and VEGF Levels in Patients with Advanced Prostate Carcinoma.']"""

The model, derived from UK data, estimates potential treatment benefit on overall survival. In this study, we externally validated the model in a large independent dataset and compared performance to existing models and within treatment groups.  Methods:   Men with non-metastatic prostate cancer and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) < 100 ng/ml diagnosed between 2000 and 2010 in the nationwide population-based Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden (PCBaSe) were included. Data on age, PSA, clinical stage, grade group, biopsy involvement, primary treatment and comorbidity were retrieved. Sixty-nine thousand two hundred six men were included with 13.9 years of median follow-up. Fifteen-year survival estimates were calculated using PREDICT Prostate for prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and all-cause mortality (ACM). Discrimination was assessed using Harrell's concordance (c)-index in R. Calibration was evaluated using cumulative available follow-up in Stata (TX, USA).  Results:   Overall discrimination of PREDICT Prostate was good with c-indices of 0.85 (95% CI 0.85-0.86) for PCSM and 0.79 (95% CI 0.79-0.80) for ACM. Overall calibration of the model was excellent with 25,925 deaths predicted and 25,849 deaths observed. Within the conservative management and radical treatment groups, c-indices for 15-year PCSM were 0.81 and 0.78, respectively. Calibration also remained good within treatment groups. The discrimination of PREDICT Prostate significantly outperformed the EAU, NCCN and CAPRA scores for both PCSM and ACM within this cohort overall. A key limitation is the use of retrospective cohort data.

The tissue collected from patients who undergo radical prostatectomy provides a unique opportunity to correlate histopathology images of the prostate with preoperative MRI to accurately map the extent of cancer from histopathology images onto MRI. We seek to develop an open-source, easy-to-use platform to align presurgical MRI and histopathology images of resected prostates in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy to create accurate cancer labels on MRI.  Methods:   Here, we introduce RAdiology Pathology Spatial Open-Source multi-Dimensional Integration (RAPSODI), the first open-source framework for the registration of radiology and pathology images. RAPSODI relies on three steps. First, it creates a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the histopathology specimen as a digital representation of the tissue before gross sectioning. Second, RAPSODI registers corresponding histopathology and MRI slices. Third, the optimized transforms are applied to the cancer regions outlined on the histopathology images to project those labels onto the preoperative MRI.  Results:   We tested RAPSODI in a phantom study where we simulated various conditions, for example, tissue shrinkage during fixation. Our experiments showed that RAPSODI can reliably correct multiple artifacts. We also evaluated RAPSODI in 157 patients from three institutions that underwent radical prostatectomy and have very different pathology processing and scanning. RAPSODI was evaluated in 907 corresponding histpathology-MRI slices and achieved a Dice coefficient of 0.97 ± 0.01 for the prostate, a Hausdorff distance of 1.99 ± 0.70 mm for the prostate boundary, a urethra deviation of 3.09 ± 1.45 mm, and a landmark deviation of 2.80 ± 0.59 mm between registered histopathology images and MRI.

It also is evident, despite the overall decrease in cancer death rates in the USA in recent decades, rural areas are experiencing a reduction in death rates much more slowly. In this study, education session content focused on PrCA risk factors, symptoms, screening, healthy diet and exercise, treatment options, and provider communication strategies. Forty individuals participated and completed pre/post-education program surveys to assess changes in PrCA knowledge and cancer decision-making. Participants showed improvements in education and awareness following the session, and overall impressions of the program were consistently positive as exhibited by participants' answers on a satisfaction survey. The findings demonstrate the real need both in terms of research to understand the underlying problem and to provide practical solutions that can be implemented to reverse the current situation.

Methods:   Patients scheduled for elective radical prostatectomy were included at a tertiary care prostate cancer clinic. Continuous monitoring of the cerebral autoregulation was performed using the correlation method. Based on measurements of cerebral oxygenation with near-infrared spectroscopy and invasive mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), a moving correlation coefficient was calculated to obtain the cerebral oxygenation index as an indicator of cerebral autoregulation. Cerebral autoregulation was measured continuously from induction until recovery from anesthesia.  Results:   There was no significant difference in cerebral autoregulation between robot-assisted and open retropubic radical prostatectomy during induction (p = 0.089), intraoperatively (p = 0.162), and during recovery from anesthesia (p = 0.620).

Methods:   Propensity-score matching was performed to conduct a case-control study from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) database. Cox regression analysis and multiple primary standardized incidence ratios were performed to investigate the risk factors of occurrence of SPMs among patients with LNETs.  Results:   Of 3,206 patients with LNETs after matching, 539 developed SPMs. The risk of developing SPMs was higher in older patients (55-74 vs ≦54: hazard ratios [HR] 1.875; age ≧75 vs ≦54: HR 2.713), higher-stage of LNETs (regional vs localized: HR 1.387; distant vs localized: HR 2.732) and recent periods of diagnosis (2004-2014 vs 1984-1993: HR 1.735). Patients with SCLC, TC and LENEC had a higher risk for SPMs compared to general population. Lung and bronchus, larynx and some digestive organs had higher risk for SPMs while some sex hormone related organs like prostate, breast, and female reproductive system had a lower incidence of SPMs.  Conclusions:   Patients with LNETs had overall higher risks of SPMs than general population.

Methods:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database from 2010 to 2015 was queried to obtain cases of patients with liver metastases at the time of primary cancer diagnosis. The primary cancers with an incidence rate of liver metastasis >0.1 are presented in this analysis.

The most common primary site was breast cancers for younger women (ages 20-50), and colorectal cancers for younger men. As patients get older, a more heterogenous population of the top cancers with liver metastases emerges including esophageal, stomach, small intestine, melanoma, and bladder cancer in addition to the large proportion of lung, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers. The 1-year survival of all patients with liver metastases was 15.1 %, compared to 24.0 % in those with non-hepatic metastases.

The primary endpoint was treatment completion rate without severe acute surgical complications. Secondary endpoints included patient-reported quality of life and physician-reported toxicities.  Methods and materials:   Patients with nonmetastatic high-risk or locally advanced prostate cancer received 24 Gy in 3 fractions to the prostate and seminal vesicles over 5 days, completed 2 weeks before RP. Patients with pN1 disease were treated after multidisciplinary discussion and shared decision making. Patient-reported quality of life (International Prostate Symptom Score and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite 26-item version questionnaires) and physician-reported toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03) were assessed before SBRT, immediately before surgery, and at 3-month intervals for 1 year.  Results:   Twelve patients were enrolled, and 11 completed treatment (1 patient had advanced disease on prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography after enrollment but before treatment). There were no significant surgical complications. After RP, 2 patients underwent additional radiation therapy to nodes with androgen suppression for pN1 disease. Median follow-up after completion of treatment was 20.1 months, with 9 of 11 patients having a follow-up period of >12 months. Two patients had biochemical recurrence (prostate-specific antigen ≥0.05) within the first 12 months, with an additional 2 patients found to have biochemical recurrence after the 12-month period.

However, its poor solubility and lack of target-ability limit its therapeutic applications. Herein, we develop a biodegradable, enzyme-responsive, and targeted polymeric micelle for cabazitaxel. The micelle is formed from two amphiphilic block copolymers. The first block copolymer consists of PEG, an enzyme-responsive peptide, and cholesterol; whereas the second block copolymer consists of a targeting ligand, PEG and cholesterol. The enzyme-responsive peptide is cleavable in the presence of matrixmetaloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), which is overexpressed in the tumor microenvironment of prostate cancer. The micelle showed a very low critical micelle concentration (CMC), high drug loading, and high entrapment efficiency. Release of cabazitaxel from the micelle is dependent on the cleavage of the enzyme-responsive peptide. Moreover, the micelle showed dramatically higher cellular uptake in prostate cancer cells compared to free cabazitaxel. Importantly, the ligand-coupled polymeric micelle demonstrated better inhibition of tumor growth in mice bearing prostate cancer xenografts compared to unmodified micelle and free cabazitaxel. Taken together, these findings suggest that the enzyme-responsive cabazitaxel micelle is a potent and promising drug delivery system for advanced prostate cancer therapy. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Herein, we develop a biodegradable, enzyme-responsive, and actively targeted polymer micelle for cabazitaxel, which is a novel tubulin inhibitor with poor affinity for P-glycoprotein. Despite cabazitaxel's great promise for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, its poor solubility, lack of target-ability, and high systemic toxicity limit its therapeutic applications, and therefore a targeted delivery system is highly needed for cabazitaxel. Our results demonstrate the importance of active targeting in targeted prostate cancer therapy. Encapsulating cabazitaxel in the micelle increases its activity and is expected to reduce its systemic toxicity, which is a major hurdle in its clinical applications. Moreover, the polymeric micelle may servers as a promising nanoscale platform for the targeted delivery of other chemotherapeutic agents to prostate cancer.""","""['Ashutosh Barve', 'Akshay Jain', 'Hao Liu', 'Zhen Zhao', 'Kun Cheng']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Acta Biomater""","""['Self-assembled micelles of novel amphiphilic copolymer cholesterol-coupled F68 containing cabazitaxel as a drug delivery system.', 'Cancer-targeted and glutathione-responsive micellar carriers for controlled delivery of cabazitaxel.', 'Engineering folate-targeting diselenide-containing triblock copolymer as a redox-responsive shell-sheddable micelle for antitumor therapy in vivo.', 'Cabazitaxel for the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Current development of cabazitaxel drug delivery systems.', 'Polymeric Micellar Systems-A Special Emphasis on ""Smart"" Drug Delivery.', 'Controlled-release of apatinib for targeted inhibition of osteosarcoma by supramolecular nanovalve-modified mesoporous silica.', 'Smart Polymeric Micelles for Anticancer Hydrophobic Drugs.', 'New Advances in Biomedical Application of Polymeric Micelles.', 'Construction and Biological Evaluation of Multiple Modification Hollow Mesoporous Silicone Doxorubicin Nanodrug Delivery System.']"""

Methods and materials:   Patients were treated in escalating dose levels of 35, 40, and 45 Gy, over 5 fractions. Data from all 26 patients enrolled in the protocol were analyzed using multiple dose-volume cut points for multiple GU organs at risk. Univariate logistical regression and Fisher exact test were used to assess statistical significance associated with incidence of toxicity.  Results:   The median follow-up was 36 months for all patients. Acute GU toxicity was mild and resolved spontaneously. Eight out of 26 patients (30.7%) developed late GU toxicity of grade 2 or higher. Two patients developed grade 3 ureteral stenosis, 1 in the 35 Gy arm and the other in the 45 Gy arm. Three patients developed grade 2 or higher hematuria/cystitis, and 3 developed grade 2 or higher incontinence. Incidence of grade 3 ureteral stenosis was related to the absolute volume of bladder wall receiving greater than 20, 25, and 30 Gy (P < .01). Grade 2 cystitis and hematuria were related to the volume of bladder wall receiving 20 Gy less than 34% and 35 Gy less than 25% (18.8% vs 60% and 23.8% vs 80%, respectively, P < .05). Incontinence was related to mean urethral dose less than 35 Gy and 25 Gy (4.3% vs 66.7% and 0% vs 37.5%, respectively, P < .05) and volume of urethra receiving 35 Gy less than 24% (8.3% vs 50%, P < .05).  Conclusions:   This is the first analysis to report dose-volume thresholds associated with late GU toxicity in patients receiving prostate bed stereotactic body radiation therapy.

According to the obtained results, we can speak of a synchronous changes in the expression of SELT and SEP15 mRNA depending on the concentration of MSA for 24 h, while the pattern of SELM expression was completely opposite and was radically different from other selenoproteins. It should be noted that in HT-1080 cells, the expression pattern of SELM differed from the expression pattern in two other cancer cells, while the expression patterns of other ER-resident selenoproteins (SELT, SEP15, SELK, SELS, SELN and DIO2) differed slightly depending on the cell line. Also we investigated the molecular mechanisms of UPR caused by MSA-induced ER stress in three cancer cell lines. According to the obtained results, it can be assumed that in DU 145 cells, MSA promotes activation of the PERK signaling pathway of UPR. In fibrosarcoma cells MSA was promoted the activation of ATF-6 UPR signaling pathway. In MCF 7 cells, MSA promoted the activation of two pro-apoptotic UPR signaling pathways at once: IRE1 and ATF-6.The results of this work once again demonstrate that the mechanisms of ER-stress regulation caused by the same agent, in this case, MSA, lead to the activation of different UPR signaling pathways in different cancer cells, and about their relationship.""","""['M V Goltyaev', ""V N Mal'tseva"", 'E G Varlamova']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Gene""","""['Effects of Sodium Selenite and Dithiothreitol on Expression of Endoplasmic Reticulum Selenoproteins and Apoptosis Markers in MSF7 Breast Adenocarcinoma Cells.', 'Methylseleninic acid and sodium selenite induce severe ER stress and subsequent apoptosis through UPR activation in PEL cells.', 'The tumorigenic role of DSPP and its potential regulation of the unfolded protein response and ER stress in oral cancer cells.', 'Emerging roles of endoplasmic reticulum-resident selenoproteins in the regulation of cellular stress responses and the implications for metabolic disease.', 'The unfolded protein response at the crossroads of cellular life and death during endoplasmic reticulum stress.', 'The Role of Selenium Nanoparticles in the Treatment of Liver Pathologies of Various Natures.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of the Cytotoxic Effect of Recombinant Selenoprotein SELENOM on Human Glioblastoma Cells.', 'Metabolism of Selenium, Selenocysteine, and Selenoproteins in Ferroptosis in Solid Tumor Cancers.', 'Selenoprotein S: A versatile disordered protein.', 'Selenium: An Antioxidant with a Critical Role in Anti-Aging.']"""

Aberrant SATB1 expression has been reported in various neoplasms. However, correlations between SATB1 and tumor immune infiltration and prognosis in malignancies still remains unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS We used Oncomine and the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource database to explore the expression of SATB1 in cancers. In addition, Kaplan-Meier plotter, PrognoScan, and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis were also used to assess the effects of SATB1 on clinical prognosis. Furthermore, correlations between cancer immune infiltration and SATB1 were analyzed via Tumor Immune Estimation Resource. RESULTS The results demonstrated that SATB1 correlates with prognosis in different types of cancers, such as breast invasive carcinoma (BRAC), head and neck cancer (HNSC), and prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD). Decreased expression of SATB1 was associated with poor overall and progression-free survival of BRAC patients with positive estrogen receptor (ER) as well as mutated TP53. In addition, B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells infiltration in BRAC, HNSC, and PRAD were also correlated with SATB1 expression level. Moreover, we found strong correlations between SATB1 and various immune markers for BRAC, HNSC, and PRAD.

This study developed pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models of TAK-448 and leuprorelin acetate (TAP-144) in a rat vertebral-cancer of the prostate (VCaP) androgen-sensitive prostate cancer xenograft model to quantitatively assess and compare the anti-tumor effects of both drugs. A potential contribution of the hormone-independent direct effects of TAK-448 to the tumor growth inhibition was also investigated in the in vivo rat xenograft model, because our in vitro experiments revealed that TAK-448 may also directly suppress VCaP cellular proliferation. The PK/PD model successfully described the time course of tumor growth inhibition after drug treatment as well as the development of resistance to the inhibition of androgen hormones, following drug treatment or castration. The EC50 of the hormone-dependent inhibitory effect of TAK-448 was much lower than that of TAP-144, and TAK-448 also has a faster onset of anti-tumor effect than TAP-144, demonstrating that TAK-448 has a stronger overall anti-tumor effect than TAP-144. In addition, model inference, by incorporating a hormone-independent inhibition pathway of TAK-448 into the PK-PD model, suggested that such a direct inhibition pathway for TAK-448 cannot be excluded, as also indicated by in vitro studies, but its EC50 would be approximately three orders of magnitude higher than that of the hormone-dependent pathway.

Methods:   A total of 404 patients undergoing prostate biopsy from April 2016 to July 2019 were enrolled. One hundred and ninety-four patients with prostatic cancer (PCa) were diagnosed by pathology. Two hundred and ten patients were diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the effect of AST/ALT ratio and other factors on the incidence of PCa.  Result:   AST/ALT ratio was significantly higher in PCa than in BPH patients (OR 2.313, 95%CI 1.337-4.003, P = .002). ROC curve indicated that the best cutoff was 1.155 in predicting the incidence risk of PCa. The age of PCa patients is higher than BPH patients (OR 1.054, 95%CI 1.027-1.082, P < .001). We also found that platelets were lower in PCa than in BPH patients. Multivariate analysis showed that AST/ALT ratio could be used as an independent predictor to assess the incident risk of PCa(OR 1.043, 95%CI 1.014-1.072, P = .003). However, AST/ALT ratio did not predict the incidence in high-risk or low-risk PCa.  Conclusion:   AST/ALT ratio was an independent factor in predicting the incidence of PCa. When the level of AST/ALT ratio in serum raised, the incidence risk of PCa was significantly increased, which was helpful for the clinical diagnosis of PCa.

We studied the types of occult cancer most often associated with stroke.  Materials and methods:   All patients with incident stroke in Denmark 2003-2015 were identified through the Danish Stroke Registry (n = 85 893) and matched 1:10 on age and sex to the Danish background population without history of stroke (n = 858 740). Linking data to the Danish Cancer Registry, we determined the prevalence of occult cancer in stroke defined as the event of previously unknown cancer during a one-year follow-up in the stroke and the background population. We stratified cancers into the 15 most common cancers and into cancers related to and not related to smoking.  Results:   Prevalence (per 1000 person-years; stroke/background population) of smoking-related occult cancers (lung, colon, bladder rectum, pancreas, kidney, stomach, and head and neck) was 13.3/8.1 (P < .01) and of cancers not related to smoking (prostate, breast, melanoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, ovary, endometrial) it was 6.6/6.2 (P > .05). Among men with stroke prostate (5.8), lung (5.7), and colon cancers (2.9) were most frequent; among women, it was lung (4.7), breast(3.5), and colon cancer(2.8). Among men in the background population, prostate(5.4), lung (3.0), and colon cancers (2.1) were most frequent. Among women, it was breast (3.7), lung(2.1), and colon cancers (1.9).  Conclusion:   Stroke patients' increased risk of occult cancer was predominantly for smoking-related cancers while there was no higher risk for the most frequent cancers unrelated to smoking, that is, prostate and breast cancers.

Androgen deprivation therapy is initially successful, however eventually fails, and tumors progress to the more aggressive castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). Yet, androgen receptor (AR) usually remains as a major regulator of tumor cell proliferation in CRPC. Interleukin-23 (IL-23) was recently shown to promote the development of CRPC by driving AR transcription. Here we used the androgen-sensitive LNCaP, castration-resistant C4-2, and 22Rv1 cells. Interestingly, cellular senescence is induced in these human cell lines by treatment with the AR antagonists enzalutamide (ENZ) or darolutamide (ODM), which might be one underlying mechanism for inhibition of PCa cell proliferation. Treatment with IL-23 alone did not change cellular senescence levels in these cell lines, whereas IL-23 inhibited significantly cellular senescence levels induced by ENZ or ODM in both CRPC cell lines C4-2 and 22Rv1 but not in LNCaP cells. This indicates a response of IL-23 specific in CRPC cells. Generating LNCaP and C4-2 three-dimensional (3D) spheroids and treatment with AR antagonists resulted in the reduced spheroid volume and thus growth inhibition. However, the combination of AR antagonists with IL-23 did not affect the antagonist-mediated reduction of spheroid volumes. This observation was confirmed with proliferation assays using adherent monolayer cell cultures. Taken together, the data indicate that IL-23 treatment reduces the AR antagonists-induced level of cellular senescence of CRPC cells, which could be one possible mechanism for promoting castration resistance.""","""['Siddharth Gupta', 'Thanakorn Pungsrinont', 'Ondrej Ženata', 'Laura Neubert', 'Radim Vrzal', 'Aria Baniahmad']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Horm Cancer""","""['Combination therapy with novel androgen receptor antagonists and statin for castration-resistant\xa0prostate cancer.', 'Combination therapy with androgen receptor N-terminal domain antagonist EPI-7170 and enzalutamide yields synergistic activity in AR-V7-positive prostate cancer.', 'Moving Towards Precision Urologic Oncology: Targeting Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer and Mutated Forms of the Androgen Receptor Using the Novel Inhibitor Darolutamide (ODM-201).', 'ODM-201: a new-generation androgen receptor inhibitor in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Clinical Development of Darolutamide: A Novel Androgen Receptor Antagonist for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Baicalin Antagonizes Prostate Cancer Stemness via Inhibiting Notch1/NF-κB Signaling Pathway.', ""Let's Go 3D!

Methods:   We identified 43,806 men within the National Cancer Database with pathologic node-negative prostate cancer diagnosed in 2010 through 2014 with PSM. The primary endpoint was receipt of planned (RT) within a patient's initial course of treatment. We examined post-RP androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with RT as a secondary endpoint. We evaluated patterns of post-operative management and characteristics associated with planned post-prostatectomy RT.  Results:   Within 12 months of RP, 87.0% received no planned RT, 8.5% RT alone, 1.3% ADT alone, and 3.1% RT with ADT. In a multivariable logistic regression model, planned RT use was associated with clinical and pathologic characteristics as estimated by surgical Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA-S) category (intermediate versus low, OR = 2.87, 95% CI 2.19-3.75, P < 0.001; high versus low, OR = 10.23, 95% CI 7.79-13.43, P < 0.001), treatment at community versus academic centers (OR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.15-1.34, P < 0.001), shorter distance to a treatment facility (OR = 0.97 for each 10-mile, 95% CI 0.96-0.98, P < 0.001), and uninsured status (OR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.10-1.77, P = 0.005).

In this study, we explored whether napsin A, a sensitive marker for lung adenocarcinoma, may also have a role in distinguishing nephrogenic adenoma from other genitourinary lesions. Immunohistochemically, napsin A was expressed in all 43 nephrogenic adenomas (bladder: 38, prostatic urethra: 4, and ureter: 1; mean positive tumor cells: 72%, median: 80%, range: 15-100%) and showed regional variability in its expression pattern with a bias toward surface architectures (flat, papillary) compared with stromal architectures (tubular/glandular, microcystic). We also compared napsin A with other markers including PAX8, GATA3, p63, and 34BE12. Although napsin A matched PAX8 in terms of its sensitivity for nephrogenic adenoma (100%), napsin A stained a lower percentage of tumor cells than PAX8 (72% vs 99%, respectively, P = 1.0 × 10-5). P63 was negative in all nephrogenic adenomas, whereas GATA3 showed variable staining in 25 cases (58%). All 43 nephrogenic adenomas showed variable 34BE12 staining. Finally, we profiled napsin A expression among 401 genitourinary tumors on tissue microarrays (n = 308) and full tissue blocks (N = 93) and observed napsin A positivity in 37 tumors (9%), which included urothelial carcinomas with the glandular/microcystic component differentiation (in the glandular/microcystic component in 4/6), bladder adenocarcinomas (primary: 4/4 and metastatic: 3/3), urinary tract clear-cell carcinomas (primary: 8/9, metastatic uterine primary: 1/1), and some renal tumors (17/174). All 81 pure urothelial carcinomas and 53 prostatic acinar adenocarcinomas were negative for napsin A.

During a radiotherapy session, healthy tissues are exposed to radiation, even with these safety guarantees. This unwanted exposure may increase the likelihood of developing secondary cancer. This work uses the MCNP-5 code to computationally simulate a conformational 3D radiotherapy protocol for prostate cancer. Also, it investigates the potential effects of radiotherapy room shielding composition on equivalent and effective doses in the patient's body. A computational model of an actual room was developed considering a Varian Trilogy linac operating at 10 MeV. This model enabled dose calculations for an anthropomorphic phantom called REX to be performed. This phantom has sufficient details of all relevant organs and tissues needed to estimate the effective dose of the patient. The treatment protocol modeled in this study came from the database of patients treated by the Brazilian National Cancer Institute (Inca). For this protocol, the total dose to be applied to the patient is equally distributed over the four gantry inclination angles (0°, 90°, 180° and 270°). The simulated results suggested that the equivalent dose on different organs and tissues has been increased by concrete shielding. Regarding the effective dose due to the presence of additional shielding (steel or lead), the simulation suggests that such variations can be considered small. Overall the results allowed quantifying the specific contribution of concrete, lead, and steel as part of shielding on the equivalent and effective doses in the patient.""","""['Marcos P C Medeiros', 'Ademir X Silva', 'Wilson F Rebello', 'Raphael F G Santos', 'Ricardo M Stenders', 'Delson Braz', 'Kelmo L Braga', 'Jardel L Thalhofer', 'Mirta B T Berdeguez', 'Edson R Andrade']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Appl Radiat Isot""","""['Monte Carlo dose calculations of shielding disks with different material combinations in intraoperative electron radiation therapy (IOERT).', 'Radiation protection measurements around a 12 MeV mobile dedicated IORT accelerator.', 'Part II: Verification of the TrueBeam head shielding model in Varian VirtuaLinac via out-of-field doses.', 'Calculated organ doses using Monte Carlo simulations in a reference male phantom undergoing HDR brachytherapy applied to localized prostate carcinoma.', 'On the production of neutrons in laminated barriers for 10 MV medical accelerator rooms.']"""

However, PCa recurrence and progression rates during ADT are high. Until now, there has been no evidence regarding when progression begins. This study evaluated the gene expression of intraprostatic androgen receptor (AR) and steroidogenic enzymes in the early stages of ADT.  Methods:   Prostate tissue samples were taken from PCa patients with urinary retention who received ADT (ADT-PCa; n = 10) and were further subgrouped into ADT ≤12 months (n = 4) and ADT > 12 months (n = 6). The ADT-PCa tissues were then compared with BPH (n = 12) and primary (no treatment) PCa tissues (n = 16). mRNA for gene expression analysis of AR and steroidogenic enzymes was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues and analyzed by real-time PCR. Protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry with specific antibodies.  Results:   AR gene expression was higher in the ADT-PCa group than in the BPH or primary PCa group. Both the ADT ≤12 and > 12 months subgroups had significantly higher relative gene expression levels of AR (p < 0.01 and 0.03, respectively) than the primary PCa group. In the ADT-PCa group, AR protein expression showed an increasing trend in the ADT ≤12 months subgroup and was significantly elevated in the ADT > 12 months subgroup compared with the PCa group (100%; p < 0.01). Half (50%) of the patients in the ADT ≤12 months subgroup were found to have upregulation of AR, and one showed upregulation beginning at 3 months of ADT. A trend toward elevated relative gene expression of SRD5A3 was also apparent in the ADT groups.  Conclusion:   AR and steroidogenic enzymes are upregulated in ADT-PCa patients as early as 3 months, without PSA elevation.

The purpose of this research was the evaluation of a new99mTc-labeled GnRH analogue as an imaging probe for tumor targeting of prostate cancer.  Methods: 99mTc-labeled-DLys6-GnRH analogue was prepared based on HYNIC as a chelating agent and tricine/ EDDA as coligands for labeling with 99mTc. HYNIC was coupled to epsilon amino group of DLys6 through aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a linker. Radiochemical purity and stability in normal saline and serum, were determined by TLC and HPLC methods. Furthermore, calculation of protein-binding and partition coefficient constant were carried out for 99mTc labeled peptide. The cellular experiments including receptor binding specificity and affinity were studied using three prostate cancer cell lines LN-CaP, DU-145 and PC-3. Finally, the animal assessment and SPECT imaging of radiolabeled GnRH analogue were evaluated on normal mice and nude mice bearing LN-CaP tumor.  Results:   The GnRH conjugate was labeled with high radiochemical purity (~97%). The radiolabeled peptide showed efficient stability in the presence of normal saline and human serum. The in vitro cellular assays on three prostate cancer cell lines indicated that the radiotracer was bound to LN-CaP cells with higher affinity compared to DU-145 and PC-3 cells. The Kd values of 99mTc- HYNIC (tricine/ EDDA)-Gaba-D-Lys6GnRH were 89.39±26.71, 93.57±30.49 and107.3±18.82 in LN-CaP, PC-3 and DU-145 cells respectively. The biodistribution studies in normal mice and LN-CaP tumor-bearing nude mice showed similar results including rapid blood clearance and low radioactivity accumulation in non-target organs. High kidney uptake proved that the main excretion route of radiopeptide was through the urinary system. The tumor uptake was 1.72±0.45 %ID/g at 1h p.i. decreasing to 0.70±0.06%ID/g at 4h p.i. for 99mTc-HYNIC-Gaba-D-Lys6GnRH. The maximum tumor/ muscle ratio was 2.30 at 1h p.i. Pre-saturation of receptor using an excess of unlabeled peptide revealed that the tumor uptake was receptor mediated. The results of the SPECT image of LN-CaP tumor were in agreement with the biodistribution data.  Conclusion:   Based on this study, we suggest LN-CaP as a favorable cell line for in vivo studies on GnRH analogues. Moreover, this report shows that 99mTc-HYNIC (tricine/EDDA)-Gaba-D-Lys6GnRH may be a suitable candidate for further evaluation of prostate cancer.""","""['Arezou Masteri Farahani', 'Fariba Maleki', 'Nourollah Sadeghzadeh', 'Saeid Abediankenari', 'Seyed Mohammad Abedi', 'Mostafa Erfani']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Anticancer Agents Med Chem""","""['99m Tc-(EDDA/tricine)-HYNIC-GnRH analogue as a potential imaging probe for diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'New neurotensin analogue radiolabeled by 99m-technetium as a potential agent for tumor identification.', 'Clinical translation of a PSMA inhibitor for 99mTc-based SPECT.', ""99mTc-Ethylenenediamine-N,N'-diacetic acid/hydrazinonicotinamideLys3-bombesin."", '99mTc-Ethylenediaminediacetic acid/hydrazinonicotinic acid-dGlu1, desGlu2–6minigastrin.']"""

In particular, the cellular uptake of GSH-NS was evaluated, as their effects on cell growth, mitochondrial activity, membrane integrity, cell cycle distribution, mRNA expression, and reactive oxygen species production. The effect of GSH-NSs on cell growth was also evaluated on multicellular spheroids (MCS) and a comparison of the GSH-NS cell growth inhibitory activity, in terms of inhibition concentration (IC)50 values, was performed between 2D and 3D cell cultures. A significant decrease in 2D cell growth was observed at high GSH-NS concentrations, with the formulation with a low disulfide-bond content, GSH-NS B, being more cytotoxic than the formulation with a high disulfide-bond content, GSH-NS D. The cell growth decrease induced by GSH-NS was owing to G1 cell cycle arrest. Moreover, a significant down-regulation of mRNA expression of the cyclin genes CDK1, CDK2, and CDK4 and up-regulation of mRNA expression of the cyclin inhibitor genes CDKN1A and CDKN2A were observed. On the other hand, a significant decrease in MCS growth was also observed at high GSH-NS concentrations, but not influenced by the nanosponge disulfide-bond content, with the MCS IC50 values being significantly higher than those obtained on 2D cell cultures. GSH-NSs are suitable nanocarries as they provoke limited cellular effects, as cell cycle arrest only occurred at concentrations significantly higher than those used for drug delivery.""","""['Monica Argenziano', 'Federica Foglietta', 'Roberto Canaparo', 'Rita Spagnolo', 'Carlo Della Pepa', 'Fabrizio Caldera', 'Francesco Trotta', 'Loredana Serpe', 'Roberta Cavalli']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Molecules""","""['Glutathione-responsive cyclodextrin-nanosponges as drug delivery systems for doxorubicin: Evaluation of toxicity and transport mechanisms in the liver.', 'GSH-targeted nanosponges increase doxorubicin-induced toxicity ""in vitro"" and ""in vivo"" in cancer cells with high antioxidant defenses.', 'Cyclodextrin nanosponge for the GSH-mediated delivery of Resveratrol in human cancer cells.', 'The application of nanosponges to cancer drug delivery.', 'Evolution of Cyclodextrin Nanosponges.', 'Surface Functionalised Parenteral Nanoemulsions for Active and Homotypic Targeting to Melanoma.', ""Let's Go 3D!

Its growth mainly relies on the activity of the androgen receptor (AR), justifying the use of androgen deprivation therapy as a gold standard treatment for the metastatic disease. Inhibition of the androgen axis using second generation antagonists has improved patients' survival, but is systematically confronted to resistance mechanisms, leading to a median survival that does not exceed 5 years. Counteracting this resistance has been the object of a large number of investigations, with a particular emphasis towards the identification of new AR inhibitors, whether they antagonize the receptor by a competitive or a non-competitive binding. To this end, many high content screens have been performed, to identify new non-steroidal AR antagonists, using a variety of approaches, but reported somewhat controversial results, depending on the approach and on the cell model that was used for screening. In our study, we used the U2OS osteosarcoma cells stably transfected with AR or ARv7 and a luciferase reporter as a previously validated model to screen the Prestwick Phytochemical library. The results of our screen identified ellipticine, harmol, and harmine hydrochloride as confirmed hits. Surprisingly, we could demonstrate that harmol hydrochloride, previously identified as a non-competitive inhibitor of AR or a weak inhibitor of androgen signaling, was actually a competitive antagonist of AR, which inhibits the growth of VCaP prostate cancer line, at concentrations for which it did not affect the growth of the AR negative DU145 and PC3 cells. Interestingly, we also report for the first time that harmol hydrochloride was selective for AR, as it could not alter the activity of other nuclear receptors, such as the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), the progesterone receptor (PR), or the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). Additionally, we demonstrate that, conversely to enzalutamide, harmol hydrochloride did not show any agonistic activity towards the pregnane X receptor (PXR), a master regulator of drug metabolism. Together, our results shed light on the importance of the cellular context for the screening of new AR antagonists. They further indicate that some of the potential hits that were previously identified may have been overlooked.""","""['Hadjer Dellal', 'Abdelhay Boulahtouf', 'Elina Alaterre', 'Alice Cuenant', 'Marina Grimaldi', 'William Bourguet', 'Céline Gongora', 'Patrick Balaguer', 'Philippe Pourquier']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cells""","""['Non-competitive androgen receptor inhibition in vitro and in vivo.', 'Antiandrogenic effects of novel androgen synthesis inhibitors on hormone-dependent prostate cancer.', 'A molecule inducing androgen receptor degradation and selectively targeting prostate cancer cells.', 'Darolutamide as a Second-Generation Androgen Receptor Inhibitor in the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Second generation androgen receptor antagonists and challenges in prostate cancer treatment.', 'Antiandrogenic and Estrogenic Activity Evaluation of Oxygenated and Nitrated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Using Chemically Activated Luciferase Expression Assays.', 'Detecting molecular interactions in live-cell single-molecule imaging with proximity-assisted photoactivation (PAPA).', ""Harmol promotes α-synuclein degradation and improves motor impairment in Parkinson's models via regulating autophagy-lysosome pathway."", 'Identification of harmine and β-carboline analogs from a high-throughput screen of an approved drug collection; profiling as differential inhibitors of DYRK1A and monoamine oxidase A and for in vitro and in vivo anti-cancer studies.']"""

Clinical failure of these treatments in CRPC highlights the urgent need to develop novel strategies to more effectively block androgen receptor (AR) signaling and target other oncogenic factors responsible for ADT resistance.  Methods:   We developed a small-molecule compound LG1836 and investigated the in vitro and in vivo activity of LG1836 against CRPC in cellular and animal models.  Results:   LG1836 exhibits potent in vitro cytotoxicity in CRPC cells. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that LG1836 inhibits the expression of AR and AR variant 7, partially mediated via proteasome-dependent protein degradation. LG1836 also suppresses survivin expression and effectively induces apoptosis in CRPC cells. Significantly, as a single agent, LG1836 is therapeutically efficacious in suppressing the in vivo growth of CRPC in the subcutaneous and intraosseous models and extends the survival of tumor-bearing mice.

A secondary aim of the study is to produce data on the predictors of a positive F-choline PET/CT result in the setting of PCa primaries and biochemical recurrences.  Materials and methods:   This multicenter retrospective cohort study is based on data collected by 9 Italian nuclear medicine departments. Between October 2008 and September 2019, 3343 men underwent F-choline PET/CT scans before receiving definitive treatments for a primary PCa or biochemical recurrence. Inclusion criteria were (1) histologically proven PCa (on surgical specimens or prostate biopsies from patients not treated surgically) and (2) availability of clinical and pathological data, including serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) level at the time of PET/CT scanning.  Results:   F-choline PET/CT was performed in 545 cases (16.4%) for cancer staging and in 2798 (83.6%) for restaging purposes, and the result was positive in 540 (99.1%) for the former and 1993 (71.2%) for the latter. A positive PET/CT result was always associated with a high Gleason score (>7) and high PSA levels (P < 0.01). The percentage of patients with a PSA threshold less than 1.0 ng/mL for performing PET/CT was higher in the years 2014 to 2019 (n = 341, 25% of cases) than during the previous period (n = 148, 16%; in 2008-2013). When used for staging purposes, receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that PSA levels of 9.2, 16.4, and 16.6 ng/mL were the optimal cutoffs for distinguishing between positive and negative PET/CT findings for local disease, lymph node involvement, and metastasis, respectively. In the restaging setting, a PSA level of 1.27 ng/mL was the optimal cutoff for distinguishing between a positive and negative PET/CT scan.  Conclusions:   F-choline PET/CT can help identify early recurrences, even in the case of low PSA levels (<1 ng/mL).

Methods:   A total of 125 patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer underwent Tc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT. All 364 prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive lesions in the field of view were assessed quantitatively to calculate PSMA-derived metabolic tumor parameters, including whole-body PSMA tumor volume and whole-body total lesion PSMA. These metrics were correlated with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and Gleason scores. In a subset of 50 patients who underwent Tc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT before the initiation of ADT or EBRT, TL-PSMA and SUVmax were compared with radiographic response assessment by CT based on RECIST 1.1 and to biochemical response (BR) determined by changes in serum PSA levels.  Results:   Serum PSA levels correlated with SUVmax, whole-body PSMA tumor volume, and whole-body total lesion PSMA in patients with 1 and in those with more than 1 PSMA-positive lesion (P < 0.05). The correlations were significant for both well-differentiated (Gleason score ≤7) and poorly differentiated tumors (Gleason score ≥8) (P < 0.05). The agreement between TL-PSMA derived from SPECT and BR in patients who underwent Tc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT before and after initiation of ADT was 80% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43-0.91; Cohen κ = 0.68; P < 0.05); in these patients, the agreement between TL-PSMA and CT was 60% (95% CI, 0.20-0.72; Cohen κ = 0.46; P < 0.05) and the agreement between BR and CT was 52% (0.07-0.61; Cohen κ = 0.34; P < 0.05). Comparable results were found for patients who underwent SPECT/CT before and after initiation of EBRT, with the strongest agreement between TL-PSMA and BR (80%; 95% CI, 0.38-0.93; Cohen κ = 0.66; P < 0.05) compared with the agreement between TL-PSMA and CT (60%; 95% CI, 0.13-0.69; Cohen κ = 0.69; P < 0.05) and between BR and CT (48%; 95% CI, 0-0.54; Cohen κ = 0.26; P = 0.11). Discordant findings between SPECT and CT were most likely due to limitations in the assessment of small lymph node metastases and bone involvement, which were detectable on SPECT but not on CT.  Conclusions:   The results of our study show that Tc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT is a promising method for the evaluation of treatment response in patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer who undergo either ADT or EBRT. TL-PSMA for assessment of treatment response has the strongest correlation with serum PSA levels, superior to SUVmax-based evaluation and response assessment based on CT data and RECIST 1.1.""","""['Christian Schmidkonz', 'Theresa Ida Götz', 'Armin Atzinger', 'Philipp Ritt', 'Olaf Prante', 'Torsten Kuwert', 'Tobias Bäuerle', 'Peter Goebell', 'Michael Cordes']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Nucl Med""","""['68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT-derived metabolic parameters for determination of whole-body tumor burden and treatment response in prostate cancer.', 'PSMA SPECT/CT with 99mTc-MIP-1404 in biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer: predictive factors and efficacy for the detection of PSMA-positive lesions at low and very-low PSA levels.', 'Assessment of Treatment Response by 99mTc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT: A Pilot Study in Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA-PET/CT)-guided stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy for oligometastatic prostate cancer: a single-institution experience and review of the published literature.', 'Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen PET: Therapy Response Assessment in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Development of 177LuLu-LNC1003 for radioligand therapy of prostate cancer with a moderate level of PSMA expression.', 'Preclinical evaluation and first in human study of Al18F radiolabeled ODAP-urea-based PSMA targeting ligand for PET imaging of prostate cancer.', 'An Albumin-Binding PSMA Ligand with Higher Tumor Accumulation for PET Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', 'A Review on the Current State and Future Perspectives of 99mTcTc-Housed PSMA-i in Prostate Cancer.']"""

The aim of this study is to identify key genes and their regulatory networks and evaluate the usefulness of these genes on diagnosis of and prognosis for prostate cancer. The gene expression microarray dataset GSE55945 was downloaded for analysis. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were accessed with RStudio. Gene ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed using the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery (DAVID) database. A protein-protein interaction network was carried out using STRING. The survival and diagnostic analysis of hub genes were conducted using the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) data. Finally, we identified 387 DEGs. GO and KEGG analyses reveled that the DEGs in PCa were mainly enriched in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway and cytochrome P450. Among 15 hub genes, we found that only a different expression level of MYH11 affected patient survival.

Methods:   Twenty-seven cancer survivors with persistent insomnia were recruited to this qualitative study following completion of treatment for breast (12), prostate (7), colorectal (7), and gynaecological (1) cancers. Eleven males and 16 females (mean age 62 years), who met DSM-5 criteria for insomnia disorder, contributed to one of four focus group discussions, designed to explore the lived experience of persistent insomnia and its management within cancer care services.  Results:   Poor sleep was a persistently troubling complaint for participants, long after the completion of active cancer treatment. The impact of insomnia was significant for all participants, with six key domains emerging as those most affected: temperament, sociability, physical well-being, cognitive functioning, relationships, and psychological well-being. In terms of insomnia management, participants frequently resorted to unfruitful self-management strategies, due to the lack of professional insomnia expertise within cancer care settings. Three main themes emerged in relation to insomnia management: self-management, seeking professional intervention, and a lack of focus on sleep. A lack of clinician understanding of the importance of sleep health and the poor availability of evidence-based insomnia interventions, such as cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-i), were highlighted as important gaps in cancer care.  Conclusions:   Insomnia was found to have a detrimental and pervasive impact on cancer survivors' quality of life, which persisted long into survivorship. There is an absence of professional attention to sleep throughout the cancer care trajectory, contributing to its prevalence, persistence, and impact. In order to break this cycle, sleep health should be integrated as a key aspect of cancer treatment and rehabilitation, much like maintaining a healthy diet and appropriate levels of physical activity.""","""['Paul Reynolds-Cowie', 'Leanne Fleming']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Br J Health Psychol""","""['Light-enhanced cognitive behavioural therapy for sleep and fatigue: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial during chemotherapy for breast cancer.', 'Internet-delivered insomnia intervention improves sleep and quality of life for adolescent and young adult cancer survivors.', 'A Feasibility Study of Group-Delivered Behavioral Interventions for Insomnia Among Breast Cancer Survivors: Comparing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia and a Mind-Body Intervention.', 'Home-based multidimensional survivorship programmes for breast cancer survivors.', 'Assessing Efficacy of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia in the Oncology Population.', 'Sleep and cancer recurrence and survival in patients with resected Stage III colon cancer: findings from CALGB/SWOG 80702 (Alliance).', 'Discrepancy between desired time in bed and desired total sleep time in patients with cancer: The DBST index and its relationship with insomnia severity and sleep onset latency.', 'Sleep reactivity predicts insomnia in patients diagnosed with breast cancer.', '""I Beat Cancer to Feel Sick:"" Qualitative Experiences of Sleep Disturbance in Black Breast Cancer Survivors and Recommendations for Culturally Targeted Sleep Interventions.', 'Referral process to further evaluate poor sleep in breast cancer survivors.']"""

Recently, we have shown a novel pathway of EV biogenesis in PCa cell lines, PC3 and PC3M. However, as the characteristics of EVs are divergent even among PCa cell lines, we hypothesized that other pathways or common regulatory pathways of EV biogenesis still exist. Here, we performed quantitative high-throughput screening to determine the key regulatory genes involved in EV biogenesis in 22Rv1 cells, which secrete a different type of EVs. In total, 1728 miRNAs were screened and miR-1908 was selected as the potential miRNA regulating EV biogenesis in 22Rv1 cells. Subsequently, we investigated target genes of miR-1908 using siRNA screening and identified that spermidine synthase (SRM) was the key regulator of EV secretion in 22Rv1 cells. Attenuation of SRM expression significantly inhibited secretion of EVs in 22Rv1 cells, and overexpression of SRM was confirmed in PCa tissues. Furthermore, we found that the number of endosome compartments was increased in cellular cytoplasm after knockdown of the SRM gene. In conclusion, our results showed that miR-1908-mediated regulation of SRM can control secretion of EVs in PCa. In addition, these data suggested that the EV secretion pathway was dependent on cellular characteristics.""","""['Fumihiko Urabe', 'Nobuyoshi Kosaka', 'Yurika Sawa', 'Kagenori Ito', 'Takahiro Kimura', 'Shin Egawa', 'Takahiro Ochiya', 'Yusuke Yamamoto']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Sci""","""['miR-26a regulates extracellular vesicle secretion from prostate cancer cells via targeting SHC4, PFDN4, and CHORDC1.', 'Extracellular vesicle-derived circ_SLC19A1 promotes prostate cancer cell growth and invasion through the miR-497/septin 2 pathway.', 'Impact of Extracellular Vesicle Isolation Methods on Downstream Mirna Analysis in Semen: A Comparative Study.', 'Extracellular vesicles promote esophageal cancer progression by delivering lncZEB1-AS1 between cells.', 'Communication of prostate cancer cells with bone cells via extracellular vesicle RNA; a potential mechanism of metastasis.', 'Development of a polyamine gene expression score for predicting prognosis and treatment response in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'miR-1908: a microRNA with diverse functions in cancers and non-malignant conditions.', 'Dietary stilbenes as modulators of specific miRNAs in prostate cancer.', 'miR-1908 Dysregulation in Human Cancers.', 'Extracellular vesicles in urological malignancies.']"""

Ultrasound could be used for cancer treatments if the repetition frequency is fitted to the purpose. We investigated the possible therapeutic effect of ultrasound irradiation on PC cells.  Materials and methods:   We irradiated two PC cell lines, androgen-dependent LNCaP and -independent PC-3 with ultrasound (3.0 W/cm2 , 3 MHz, irradiation time rate: 20%) for 2 minutes for 1 day or 3 consecutive days at a repetition frequency of 1, 10, or 100 Hz in vitro. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were determined after irradiation.  Results:   Cell proliferation of PC-3 was significantly inhibited after 1 day (P < .0001) and 3 days (P < .0001) of 10 Hz ultrasound irradiation, and that of LNCaP after 1 day (P < .0001) and 3 days (P < .0001) of irradiation. LNCaP was more sensitive to ultrasound at both lower and higher cell density but PC-3 was only sensitive at a lower cell density (P < .01). Irradiation with 10 Hz ultrasound-induced significantly more PC-3 apoptotic cells than control (1 day, P = .0137; 3 days, P = .0386) rather than irradiation with 1 Hz. Apoptosis via caspase-3 was induced at 10 Hz in 1-day (P < .05) irradiation in both cell lines.  Conclusions:   Ultrasound irradiation with even 1 day of 10 Hz significantly inhibited cell proliferation in both LNCaP and PC-3, especially by the remarkable induction of apoptosis in vitro.

ExacTrac auto-match results were compared to the known offsets with uncertainties calculated. Calculated shifts were shown to be accurate within one standard deviation of the known offsets. Uncertainties were found to vary considerably among the 6 dimensions with matching in the vertical and angle vertical directions having standard deviations of 0.7 mm and 1.3°, respectively. These results agreed with the literature cases for pre-treatment setup and lower scatter condition IMRT intrafraction delivery. Based on these values, probabilities of intrafraction inhibits were calculated based on patient movement and possible fusion tolerances.

Purified nanoparticles were characterized by standard techniques, such as TEM, STM, SEM, EDS, XRD, and FTIR. Furthermore, cytotoxic activity of AgNPs-PLE was carried out against different human cancer cells and non-tumorigenic human keratinocytes cells. AgNPs-PLE when compared with AgNPs-citric acid or PLE showed better efficacy against cancer cells and was also relatively less toxic to normal cells. Treatment of DU145 cells with AgNPs-PLE (0.5-5.0 μg/ml) for 24-48 h lowered total cell number by 24-36% (P < 0.05). Inhibition of cell growth was linked with arrest of cell cycle at G2/M phase at 24 h, while G1 and G2/M phase arrests at 48 h. ROS production was observed at earlier time points in presence of AgNPs-PLE, suggesting its role behind apoptosis in DU145 cells.

Recently, endoscopic radio-guided cancer resection has been introduced where a novel tethered laparoscopic gamma detector can be used to determine the location of tracer activity, which can complement preoperative nuclear imaging data and endoscopic imaging. However, these probes do not clearly indicate where on the tissue surface the activity originates, making localization of pathological sites difficult and increasing the mental workload of the surgeons. Therefore, a robust real-time gamma probe tracking system integrated with augmented reality is proposed.  Methods:   A dual-pattern marker has been attached to the gamma probe, which combines chessboard vertices and circular dots for higher detection accuracy. Both patterns are detected simultaneously based on blob detection and the pixel intensity-based vertices detector and used to estimate the pose of the probe. Temporal information is incorporated into the framework to reduce tracking failure. Furthermore, we utilized the 3D point cloud generated from structure from motion to find the intersection between the probe axis and the tissue surface. When presented as an augmented image, this can provide visual feedback to the surgeons.  Results:   The method has been validated with ground truth probe pose data generated using the OptiTrack system. When detecting the orientation of the pose using circular dots and chessboard dots alone, the mean error obtained is [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], respectively. As for the translation, the mean error for each pattern is 1.78 mm and 1.81 mm. The detection limits for pitch, roll and yaw are [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]-[Formula: see text]-[Formula: see text] .  Conclusion:   The performance evaluation results show that this dual-pattern marker can provide high detection rates, as well as more accurate pose estimation and a larger workspace than the previously proposed hybrid markers. The augmented reality will be used to provide visual feedback to the surgeons on the location of the affected lymph nodes or tumor.""","""['Baoru Huang', 'Ya-Yen Tsai', 'João Cartucho', 'Kunal Vyas', 'David Tuch', 'Stamatia Giannarou', 'Daniel S Elson']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg""","""['Real-time surgical tool tracking and pose estimation using a hybrid cylindrical marker.', 'Evaluation of a marker-less, intra-operative, augmented reality guidance system for robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'SLAM-based dense surface reconstruction in monocular Minimally Invasive Surgery and its application to Augmented Reality.', 'Workflow and simulation of image-to-physical registration of holes inside spongy bone.', 'IBIS: an OR ready open-source platform for image-guided neurosurgery.', 'Simultaneous Depth Estimation and Surgical Tool Segmentation in Laparoscopic Images.', 'Real-time tracking of a diffuse reflectance spectroscopy probe used to aid histological validation of margin assessment in upper gastrointestinal cancer resection surgery.', 'Optical Navigation of the Drop-In γ-Probe as a Means to Strengthen the Connection Between Robot-Assisted and Radioguided Surgery.']"""

Methods:   Metabolomics analyses were performed in plasma samples from individuals classified as non-cancerous control (n = 36), with PIN (n = 16), or PCa (n = 27). Untargeted [26 moieties identified after pre-processing by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS)] and targeted [46 amino acids, carbohydrates, organic acids and fatty acids by GC/MS, and 16 nucleosides and amino acids by ultra performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole/mass spectrometry (UPLC-TQ/MS)] analyses were performed. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) concentrations were measured in all samples. In PCa patients, the Gleason scores were determined.  Results:   The metabolites that were best discriminated (p < 0.05, FDR < 0.2) for the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's post-hoc comparing the control versus the PIN and PCa groups included isoleucine, serine, threonine, cysteine, sarcosine, glyceric acid, among several others. PIN was mainly characterized by alterations on steroidogenesis, glycine and serine metabolism, methionine metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism, among others. In the case of PCa, the most predominant metabolic alterations were ubiquinone biosynthesis, catecholamine biosynthesis, thyroid hormone synthesis, porphyrin and purine metabolism.

It is thus important to create realistic in vitro models within the therapeutic pipeline that can recapitulate the fundamental stress features of the tumor swamp. Here we describe a microfluidic system which generates a chemical gradient within connected microenvironments achieved through a static diffusion mechanism rather than active pumping. We show that the gradient can be stably maintained for over a week. Due to the accessibility and simplicity of the experimental platform, the system allows for not only well-controlled continuous studies of the interactions among various cell types at single-cell resolution, but also parallel experimentation for time-resolved downstream cellular assays on the time scale of weeks. This approach enables simple, compact implementation and is compatible with existing 6-well imaging technology for simultaneous experiments. As a proof-of-concept, we report the co-culture of a human bone marrow stromal cell line and a bone-metastatic prostate cancer cell line using the presented device, revealing on the same chip a transition in cancer cell survival as a function of drug concentration on the population level while exhibiting an enrichment of poly-aneuploid cancer cells (PACCs) as an evolutionary consequence of high stress.

Promising results for detecting and grading prostate cancer on digital histopathology images have been reported using machine learning techniques. However, the importance and applicability of those methods have not been fully investigated. We computed three-class tissue component maps (TCMs) from the images, where each pixel was labeled as nuclei, lumina, or other. We applied seven different machine learning approaches: three non-deep learning classifiers with features extracted from TCMs, and four deep learning, using transfer learning with the 1) TCMs, 2) nuclei maps, 3) lumina maps, and 4) raw images for cancer detection and grading on whole-mount RP tissue sections. We performed leave-one-patient-out cross-validation against expert annotations using 286 whole-slide images from 68 patients. For both cancer detection and grading, transfer learning using TCMs performed best. Transfer learning using nuclei maps yielded slightly inferior overall performance, but the best performance for classifying higher-grade cancer. This suggests that 3-class TCMs provide the major cues for cancer detection and grading primarily using nucleus features, which are the most important information for identifying higher-grade cancer.""","""['Wenchao Han', 'Carol Johnson', 'Mena Gaed', 'José A Gómez', 'Madeleine Moussa', 'Joseph L Chin', 'Stephen Pautler', 'Glenn S Bauman', 'Aaron D Ward']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Automatic cancer detection on digital histopathology images of mid-gland radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Nuclear Shape and Architecture in Benign Fields Predict Biochemical Recurrence in Prostate Cancer Patients Following Radical Prostatectomy: Preliminary Findings.', 'Comparison of Artificial Intelligence Techniques to Evaluate Performance of a Classifier for Automatic Grading of Prostate Cancer From Digitized Histopathologic Images.', 'Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'Indications for and results of radical prostatectomy.', 'Archimedes Optimization Algorithm with Deep Learning-Based Prostate Cancer Classification on Magnetic Resonance Imaging.', 'Artificial intelligence for prostate cancer histopathology diagnostics.', 'An update on computational pathology tools for genitourinary pathology practice: A review paper from the Genitourinary Pathology Society (GUPS).', 'Cultivating Clinical Clarity through Computer Vision: A Current Perspective on Whole Slide Imaging and Artificial Intelligence.', 'Association between Nuclear Morphometry Parameters and Gleason Grade in Patients with Prostatic Cancer.']"""

However, whether the cause of their expression is an outcome of a specific regulatory mechanism or nonspecific transcription induced by genome reorganization in cancer remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated a group of lncRNAs that we previously identified to be aberrantly expressed in prostate cancer (PC), called TPCATs. Our high-throughput real-time PCR experiments were integrated with publicly available RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data and revealed that the expression of a subset of TPCATs is driven by PC-specific transcription factors (TFs), especially androgen receptor (AR) and ETS-related gene (ERG). Our in vitro validations confirmed that AR and ERG regulated a subset of TPCATs, most notably for EPCART. Knockout of EPCART was found to reduce migration and proliferation of the PC cells in vitro. The high expression of EPCART and two other TPCATs (TPCAT-3-174133 and TPCAT-18-31849) were also associated with the biochemical recurrence of PC in prostatectomy patients and were independent prognostic markers. Our findings suggest that the expression of numerous PC-associated lncRNAs is driven by PC-specific mechanisms and not by random cellular events that occur during cancer development.

We discovered a promising selectivity of both alkaloids for human prostate cancer (PCa) cells, including highly drug-resistant lines, compared to non-malignant cells. In cancer cells, marine derived compounds were able to induce G1- and S-cell cycle arrest as well as caspase-mediated cell death. For the first time we have identified mitochondrial targeting as a central mechanism of anticancer action for these and similar molecules. Thus, treatment with the isolated alkaloids resulted in mitochondrial membrane permeabilization consequently leading to the release of cytotoxic mitochondrial proteins to cellular cytoplasm, ROS upregulation, consequent activation of caspase-9 and -3, followed by PARP cleavage, DNA fragmentation, and apoptosis. Moreover, synergistic effects were observed when Ur-A and Ur-C were combined with clinically approved PARP inhibitor olaparib.

CRPC occurs within 2-3 years of initiation of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which is an important factor of influencing PCa metastasis. Recent studies have revealed that non-coding RNAs in PCa can enhance metastasis and progression, while the mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, we reported that the long noncoding RNA-LINC00963 was increased in CRPC tissues and promoted migration of PCa cells in vitro and their metastasis in vivo. High levels of LINC00963 significantly decreased tumor suppressor miR-542-3p, whose levels in metastasis tissues were low compared to those in non-metastasis tissues. LINC00963 promotes and miR-542-3p inhibits metastasis. Furthermore, the expression levels of LINC00963 and miR-542-3p were positively and negatively associated with the expression of NOP2. We demonstrated that NOP2 promoted PCa by activating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. For specific mechanism, dual luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-542-3p directly binds to both 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of LINC00963 and NOP2 mRNA. Taken together, our results show that LINC00963 acts as an inducer of PCa metastasis by binding miR-542-3p, thereby promoting NOP2.

Previous structural analysis and in vitro assays revealed inconsistencies surrounding the nature and potency of CYP17A1 inhibition by abiraterone. Here, we establish that abiraterone is a slow-, tight-binding inhibitor of CYP17A1, with initial weak binding preceding the subsequent slow isomerization to a high-affinity CYP17A1-abiraterone complex. The in vitro inhibition constant of the final high-affinity CYP17A1-abiraterone complex ( ( K i * = 0.39 nM )yielded a binding free energy of -12.8 kcal/mol that was quantitatively consistent with the in silico prediction of -14.5 kcal/mol. Prolonged suppression of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) concentrations observed in VCaP cells after abiraterone washout corroborated its protracted CYP17A1 engagement. Molecular dynamics simulations illuminated potential structural determinants underlying the rapid reversible binding characterizing the two-step induced-fit model. Given the extended residence time (42 hours) of abiraterone within the CYP17A1 active site, in silico simulations demonstrated sustained target engagement even when most abiraterone has been eliminated systemically. Subsequent pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) modeling linking time-dependent CYP17A1 occupancy to in vitro steroidogenic dynamics predicted comparable suppression of downstream DHEA-sulfate at both 1000- and 500-mg doses of abiraterone acetate. This enabled mechanistic rationalization of a clinically reported PK-PD disconnect, in which equipotent reduction of downstream plasma DHEA-sulfate levels was achieved despite a lower systemic exposure of abiraterone. Our novel findings provide the impetus for re-evaluating the current dosing paradigm of abiraterone with the aim of preserving PD efficacy while mitigating its dose-dependent adverse effects and financial burden. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: With the advent of novel molecularly targeted anticancer modalities, it is becoming increasingly evident that optimal dose selection must necessarily be predicated on mechanistic characterization of the relationships between target exposure, drug-target interactions, and pharmacodynamic endpoints. Nevertheless, efficacy has always been perceived as being exclusively synonymous with affinity-based measurements of drug-target binding. This work demonstrates how elucidating the slow-, tight-binding inhibition of CYP17A1 by abiraterone via in vitro and in silico analyses was pivotal in establishing the role of kinetic selectivity in mediating time-dependent CYP17A1 engagement and eventually downstream efficacy outcomes.""","""['Eleanor Jing Yi Cheong', 'Pramod C Nair', 'Rebecca Wan Yi Neo', 'Ho Thanh Tu', 'Fu Lin', 'Edmund Chiong', 'Kesavan Esuvaranathan', 'Hao Fan', 'Russell Z Szmulewitz', 'Cody J Peer', 'William D Figg', 'Christina Li Lin Chai', 'John O Miners', 'Eric Chun Yong Chan']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Pharmacol Exp Ther""","""['CYP17A1-independent production of the neurosteroid-derived 5α-pregnan-3β,6α-diol-20-one in androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell lines under serum starvation and inhibition by Abiraterone.', 'Intratumoral de novo steroid synthesis activates androgen receptor in castration-resistant prostate cancer and is upregulated by treatment with CYP17A1 inhibitors.', 'Clinical and biochemical consequences of CYP17A1 inhibition with abiraterone given with and without exogenous glucocorticoids in castrate men with advanced prostate cancer.', 'CYP17A1 inhibitors in prostate cancer: mechanisms of action independent of the androgenic pathway.', 'The hunt for a selective 17,20 lyase inhibitor; learning lessons from nature.', 'Synthesis and Preclinical Evaluation of Small-Molecule Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Targeted Abiraterone Conjugate.', 'Fully automated virtual screening pipeline of FDA-approved drugs using Caver Web.', 'Roles of cytochrome P450 enzymes in pharmacology and toxicology: Past, present, and future.', 'Biotransformation of Abiraterone Into Five Characteristic Metabolites by the Rat Gut Microbiota and Liver Microsomes.', 'How Is CYP17A1 Activity Altered in Autism?

Results:   The number of new cancer cases (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers) in 2025 is predicted to increase by 61.3% from 2678 cases in 2016 to 4319 cases.

We aimed to compare the accuracy of the ellipsoid and bullet-shaped formulas with manual whole-gland segmentation as reference standard and to evaluate the corresponding PSAd diagnostic accuracy in predicting clinically significant PCa.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analysed 195 patients with suspected PCa who underwent magnetic resonance imaging and prostate biopsy. Patients with PCa were categorized according to ISUP score. PV and corresponding PSAd were calculated with manual segmentation (mPV and mPSAd) as well as with ellipsoid (ePV and ePSAd) and bullet-shaped (bPV and bPSAd) formulas. Inter and intra-reader reproducibility were assessed with Lin's concordance correlation coefficient and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). A 2-way analysis of variance with post-hoc Bonferroni test was used for assessing PV differences. Predictive values of PSAd calculated with different methods for detecting clinically significant PCa were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and Youden's index.  Results:   Both intra (ρ = 0.99, ICC = 0.99) and inter-reader (ρ = 0.98, ICC = 0.98) reproducibility were excellent. No significant difference was found between ePV and reference standard (p = 1.00). bPV was significantly different from both (p = 0.00). PSAd (mPSAd/ePSAd cut-off ≥ 0.15, bPSAd cut-off ≥ 0.12) had sensitivity = 69-70%, specificity = 72-75%, areas under the curve = 0.757-0.760 (p = 0.70-0.88).  Conclusions:   Our work shows that when using bullet-shaped formula, a different PSAd cut-off must be considered to avoid PCa under-diagnosis and inaccurate risk-stratification.""","""['Arnaldo Stanzione', 'Andrea Ponsiglione', 'Gianluca Armando Di Fiore', 'Stefano Giusto Picchi', 'Martina Di Stasi', 'Francesco Verde', 'Mario Petretta', 'Massimo Imbriaco', 'Renato Cuocolo']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Acad Radiol""","""['Which measurement method should be used for prostate volume for PI-RADS?

Methods:   To understand the IEMs in prostate cancer and apply such understanding to the design of personalized immunotherapies, we analyzed the RNA-seq data for prostate adenocarcinoma from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using a combination of biclustering, differential expression analysis, immune cell typing, and machine learning methods.  Results:   The integrative analysis identified eight clusters with different IEM combinations and predictive biomarkers for each immune evasion cluster. Prostate tumors employ different combinations of IEMs. The majority of prostate cancer patients were identified with immunological ignorance (89.8%), upregulated cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) (58.8%), and upregulated decoy receptor 3 (DcR3) (51.6%). Among patients with immunologic ignorance, 41.4% displayed upregulated DcR3 expression, 43.26% had upregulated CTLA4, and 11.4% had a combination of all three mechanisms. Since upregulated programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and/or CTLA4 often co-occur with other IEMs, these results provide a plausible explanation for the failure of immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy for prostate cancer.  Conclusion:   These findings indicate that human prostate cancer specimens are mostly immunologically cold tumors that do not respond well to mono-immunotherapy. With such identified biomarkers, more precise treatment strategies can be developed to improve therapeutic efficacy through a greater understanding of a patient's immune evasion mechanisms.""","""['Mayassa J Bou-Dargham', 'Linlin Sha', 'Qing-Xiang Amy Sang', 'Jinfeng Zhang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Subgrouping breast cancer patients based on immune evasion mechanisms unravels a high involvement of transforming growth factor-beta and decoy receptor 3.', 'Future perspectives in melanoma research : Meeting report from the ""Melanoma Bridge"".

Genus Datura encompasses numerous species with reported medicinal uses. However, its potential as a source of natural anticancer agents is yet to be determined. Datura stramonium (DS) and Datura inoxia (DI) are the two species chosen for this study.  Methods:   Total phenolic and flavonoid content (TPC and TFC) as well as antioxidant activity were assessed through colorimetric method. Polyphenolic quantification was done by RP-HPLC. Following extract standardization ethyl acetate leaf extracts of both species (DSL-EA and DIL-EA) were chosen for anticancer studies. In vitro cytotoxicity using various models including cancer cell lines was monitored. Following toxicity studies, benzene (0.2 ml) was used to induce leukemia in Sprague-Dawley rats. Extracts were orally administered to preventive (100 and 200 mg/kg) and treatment (200 mg/kg only) groups. The antileukemic potential of extracts was assessed through haematological, biochemical, endogenous antioxidants and histological parameters.  Results:   Significant TPC and TFC were estimated in DSL-EA and DIL-EA. RP-HPLC quantified (μg/mg extract) rutin (0.89 ± 0.03), gallic acid (0.35 ± 0.07), catechin (0.24 ± 0.02) and apigenin (0.29 ± 0.09) in DSL-EA while rutin (0.036 ± 0.004) and caffeic acid (0.27 ± 0.03) in DIL-EA. Both extracts exhibited significant brine shrimp cytotoxicity (LC50 < 12.5 μg/ml). DIL-EA exhibited greater cytotoxicity against PC-3, MDA-MB 231 and MCF-7 cell lines (IC50 < 3 μg/ml in each case) as well as higher protein kinase inhibitory action (MIC: 25 μg/disc) compared to DSL-EA. Leukemia induced in rats was affirmed by elevated serum levels of WBCs (7.78 ± 0.012 (× 103) /μl), bilirubin (7.56 ± 0.97 mg/dl), Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs) (133.75 ± 2.61 nM/min/mg protein), decreased RBCs (4.33 ± 0.065 (× 106)/μl), platelets (344 ± 3.19 (× 103)/μl), total proteins (2.14 ± 0.11 g/dl), Glutathione S-transferases (GST) (81.01 ± 0.44 nM/min/ml), endogenous antioxidant enzymes levels and abnormal liver and kidney functionality in disease control rats. Both species revealed almost identical and significant (p < 0.05) alleviative effects in benzene induced leukemia.

This study quantifies variation in survival between municipalities and hospital districts responsible for primary care and for specialised care, respectively, in Finland.  Material and methods:   Five-year relative survival of 11 cancers and close to 700,000 patients was estimated by municipality in Finland over 1962-2016 using hierarchical Bayesian modelling. Variation (i) between hospital districts, (ii) between municipalities within hospital districts, and (iii) between all municipalities (total variation) were quantified by the standard deviation of 5-year relative survival standardised by the average survival level.  Results:   In 2007-2016, the largest variation in 5-year relative survival between all municipalities was in stomach, prostate, kidney and liver cancer and skin melanoma. In male skin melanoma, prostate, and kidney cancer and in male and female pancreatic cancer, there was substantial and statistically significant variation between hospital districts, too. Variation within hospital districts was on average 67% (95% posterior interval [58%,76%]) out of the total variation and had decreased by 18% [2%, 33%] from 1997-2006.  Conclusion:   The decrease in variation within hospital districts suggests that equity in diagnostics and primary care has improved in Finland. However, the variation between hospital districts in skin melanoma, prostate and kidney cancer reflects differences in early diagnostics. In pancreatic cancer, substantial variation between hospital districts may relate to regional differences in the accessibility and the quality of cancer treatments.""","""['Karri Seppä', 'Nea Malila', 'Janne Pitkäniemi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Periodic trends in geographical variation of prostate cancer incidence and mortality in Finland between 1985 and 2019.', 'Estimating multilevel regional variation in excess mortality of cancer patients using integrated nested Laplace approximation.', 'Estimating potential savings in cancer deaths by eliminating regional and social class variation in cancer survival in the Nordic countries.', 'Mortality Atlas of the Campania Region.

Event-free survival (EFS), an earlier prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based composite end point, may further expedite trial completion.  Methods:   EFS was defined as the time from random assignment to the date of first evidence of disease recurrence, including biochemical failure, local or regional recurrence, distant metastasis, or death from any cause, or was censored at the date of last PSA assessment. Individual patient data from trials within the Intermediate Clinical Endpoints in Cancer of the Prostate-ICECaP-database with evaluable PSA and disease follow-up data were analyzed. We evaluated the surrogacy of EFS for OS using a 2-stage meta-analytic validation model by determining the correlation of EFS with OS (patient level) and the correlation of treatment effects (hazard ratios [HRs]) on both EFS and OS (trial level). A clinically relevant surrogacy was defined a priori as an R2 ≥ 0.7.  Results:   Data for 10,350 patients were analyzed from 15 radiation therapy-based trials enrolled from 1987 to 2011 with a median follow-up of 10 years. At the patient level, the correlation of EFS with OS was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.42 to 0.44) as measured by Kendall's tau from a copula model. At the trial level, the R2 was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.60) from the weighted linear regression of log(HR)-OS on log(HR)-EFS.  Conclusion:   EFS is a weak surrogate for OS and is not suitable for use as an intermediate clinical end point to substitute for OS to accelerate phase III (neo)adjuvant trials of prostate cancer therapies for primary radiation therapy-based trials.""","""['Wanling Xie', 'Meredith M Regan', 'Marc Buyse', 'Susan Halabi', 'Philip W Kantoff', 'Oliver Sartor', 'Howard Soule', 'Donald Berry', 'Noel Clarke', 'Laurence Collette', ""Anthony D'Amico"", 'Richard De Abreu Lourenco', 'James Dignam', 'Mario Eisenberger', 'Nicholas James', 'Karim Fizazi', 'Silke Gillessen', 'Yohann Loriot', 'Nicolas Mottet', 'Wendy Parulekar', 'Howard Sandler', 'Daniel E Spratt', 'Matthew R Sydes', 'Bertrand Tombal', 'Scott Williams', 'Christopher J Sweeney;ICECaP Working Group']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Socioeconomic Factors, Urological Epidemiology and Practice Patterns.', 'Biochemical Failure Is Not a Surrogate End Point for Overall Survival in Recurrent Prostate Cancer: Analysis of NRG Oncology/RTOG 9601.', 'Metastasis-Free Survival Is a Strong Surrogate of Overall Survival in Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Is prostate-specific antigen a valid surrogate end point for survival in hormonally treated patients with metastatic prostate cancer?

Methods: We analyzed three Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets through the GEO2R online tool to obtain the set of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between malignant and nonmalignant prostate tissues, and further analyzed the COL4A6 gene's expression in databases. Western blot assays, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, and immunofluorescence staining were used to detect COL4A6 gene expression. Wound healing assays and cell invasion transwell assays were performed to measure cell invasion and siRNA was used to knock down COL4A6 gene expression. Results: Through the use of bioinformatic tools we showed that the COL4A6 gene is one of the highly downregulated genes in prostate cancer; additionally, hypermethylation of the COL4A6 promoter in prostate cancer is correlated with lower expression levels. We also showed that downregulation of COL4A6, which activates the p-FAK/MMP-9 signaling pathway in prostate cancer cells, is associated with prostate cancer cell metastasis based on data retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and GEO databases. Finally, we found that the COL4A6 protein is localized extracellularly and its expression is positively correlated with disease-free survival of prostate cancer patients.

Current chemotherapies to treat OC initially show therapeutic efficacy but frequently drug resistance develops, at which point therapies with alternative targets are needed. Herein, we are describing a novel approach to sensitize these tumors to standard chemotherapies by increasing the transcription of hypoxia-inducible factor antisense. Methods: Genome-wide Bru-seq analysis was performed to fully capture the nascent transcriptional signature of OC cells treated with the gp130 inhibitor, SC144. In vitro and in vivo analysis, including characterization of hypoxia and select protein expression, combination with standard of care chemotherapy and antitumor efficacy were performed to assess the biological activity of SC144 on induction of hypoxia in OC cells. Results: Bru-seq analysis of OVCAR8 cells treated with SC144 shows upregulation of hypoxia related genes. In addition, transcription of hypoxia-inducible factor antisense (HIF1A-AS2) was induced that in turn reduced expression of HIF-1α and simultaneously increased expression of NDRG1. Furthermore, we observed decreased protein levels of EGFR, Met, c-Myc, cyclin D1, MMP-2, MMP-9 and TF, and phosphorylation of Src and P130-cas. SC144-induced alterations of HIF-1α and NDRG1 were also confirmed in prostate cancer cells. Ciclopirox olamine (CPX) induces a cellular transcriptional profile comparable to SC144, suggesting a similar cellular mechanism of action between these two compounds.

Checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) is a highly conserved protein kinase implicated in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway that prevents the accumulation of DNA damage and controls regular genome duplication. CHK1 has been associated with prostate cancer (PCa) induction, progression, and lethality; hence, CHK1 inhibitors SCH900776 (also known as MK-8776) and the more effective SCH900776 analog MU380 may have clinical applications in the therapy of PCa. Synergistic induction of DNA damage with CHK1 inhibition represents a promising therapeutic approach that has been tested in many types of malignancies, but not in chemoresistant mCRPC. Here, we report that such therapeutic approach may be exploited using the synergistic action of the antimetabolite gemcitabine (GEM) and CHK1 inhibitors SCH900776 and MU380 in docetaxel-resistant (DR) mCRPC. Given the results, both CHK1 inhibitors significantly potentiated the sensitivity to GEM in a panel of chemo-naïve and matched DR PCa cell lines under 2D conditions. MU380 exhibited a stronger synergistic effect with GEM than clinical candidate SCH900776. MU380 alone or in combination with GEM significantly reduced spheroid size and increased apoptosis in all patient-derived xenograft 3D cultures, with a higher impact in DR models. Combined treatment induced premature mitosis from G1 phase resulting in the mitotic catastrophe as a prestage of apoptosis. Finally, treatment by MU380 alone, or in combination with GEM, significantly inhibited tumor growth of both PC339-DOC and PC346C-DOC xenograft models in mice. Taken together, our data suggest that metabolically robust and selective CHK1 inhibitor MU380 can bypass docetaxel resistance and improve the effectiveness of GEM in DR mCRPC models. This approach might allow for dose reduction of GEM and thereby minimize undesired toxicity and may represent a therapeutic option for patients with incurable DR mCRPC.""","""['Stanislav Drápela', 'Prashant Khirsariya', 'Wytske M van Weerden', 'Radek Fedr', 'Tereza Suchánková', 'Diana Búzová', 'Jan Červený', 'Aleš Hampl', 'Martin Puhr', 'William R Watson', 'Zoran Culig', 'Lumír Krejčí', 'Kamil Paruch', 'Karel Souček']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Oncol""","""['Novel CHK1 inhibitor MU380 exhibits significant single-agent activity in TP53-mutated chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.', 'Synthesis and Profiling of a Novel Potent Selective Inhibitor of CHK1 Kinase Possessing Unusual N-trifluoromethylpyrazole Pharmacophore Resistant to Metabolic N-dealkylation.', 'Preclinical development of the novel Chk1 inhibitor SCH900776 in combination with DNA-damaging agents and antimetabolites.', 'Chk1 inhibition significantly potentiates activity of nucleoside analogs in TP53-mutated B-lymphoid cells.', 'Inhibition of checkpoint kinase 1 potentiates anticancer activity of gemcitabine in bladder cancer cells.', ""Let's Go 3D!

Among these, cabazitaxel is offered as a new therapeutic option for patients with metastatic castration-resistant PC as that are resistant to other taxanes. Here, we investigated the cellular and molecular changes in response to cabazitaxel in comparison with docetaxel and paclitaxel in androgen-independent human PCas. The androgen-independent human PCa cell lines, PC3 and DU145, were treated with 1 to 5nM cabazitaxel, docetaxel, or paclitaxel, and assessed for cell viability (MTT assay), colony forming ability and migration (scratch assay). The induction of apoptosis was determined through measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential (JC-1 assay) and caspase-3 activity assay. The protein expression changes (caspase-3, caspase-8, Bax, Bcl-2, β-tubulin, nuclear factor-κB [NF-κB/p50, NF-κB/p65], vascular endothelial growth factor, WNT1-inducible signaling pathway protein-1 [WISP1], transforming growth factor β [TGF-β]) in response to drug treatment were screened via western blotting. Under our experimental conditions, all taxanes significantly reduced WISP1 and TGF-β expressions, suggesting an anti-metastatic/antiangiogenic effect for these drugs. On the other hand, cabazitaxel induced more cell death and inhibited colony formation compared to docetaxel or paclitaxel. The highest fold change in caspase-3 activity and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio was also detected in response to cabazitaxel. Furthermore, the induction of β-tubulin expression was lower in cabazitaxel-treated cells relative to the other taxanes. In summary, cabazitaxel shows molecular changes in favor of killing PCa cells compared to other taxanes, at least for the parameters analyzed herein.

Therefore, we develop clinically relevant prostate cancer models.  Experimental design:   Since 1996, we have generated clinically annotated patient-derived xenografts (PDXs; the MDA PCa PDX series) linked to specific phenotypes reflecting all aspects of clinical prostate cancer.  Results:   We studied two cell line-derived xenografts and the first 80 PDXs derived from 47 human prostate cancer donors. Of these, 47 PDXs derived from 22 donors are working models and can be expanded either as cell lines (MDA PCa 2a and 2b) or PDXs. The histopathologic, genomic, and molecular characteristics (androgen receptor, ERG, and PTEN loss) maintain fidelity with the human tumor and correlate with published findings. PDX growth response to mouse castration and targeted therapy illustrate their clinical utility. Comparative genomic hybridization and sequencing show significant differences in oncogenic pathways in pairs of PDXs derived from different areas of the same tumor. We also identified a recurrent focal deletion in an area that includes the speckle-type POZ protein-like (SPOPL) gene in PDXs derived from seven human donors of 28 studied (25%). SPOPL is a SPOP paralog, and SPOP mutations define a molecular subclass of prostate cancer. SPOPL deletions are found in 7% of The Cancer Genome Atlas prostate cancers, which suggests that our cohort is a reliable platform for targeted drug development.

Aim:   To determine the effects of ex vivo RT on major pelvic ganglion (MPG) neuron survival, and neurite growth in whole vs dissociated culture.  Methods:   MPGs were removed and irradiated (0 or 8 Gy) from male Sprague Dawley rats. For dissociated culture, MPG neurons were digested in collagenase/dispase and cultured on coverslips. Immunofluorescent staining for beta-tubulin III (TUBB3; neuron marker), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS; nitrergic marker), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; sympathetic marker), and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assessed neurite length, branching, autonomic neuron density, and apoptosis. For whole organ culture, MPGs were grown in Matrigel. Gene expression of apoptotic markers (caspase 1, 3), TUBB3, nNOS, TH, and Schwann cells (Sox10, Krox20, glial fibrillary acid protein) was measured in whole organ cultured MPGs by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.  Outcomes:   After 72 hours, neurite length, branching, autonomic neuron density, and apoptosis were assessed, and gene expression was measured.  Results:   RT increased apoptosis in dissociated neurons measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (P < .001) and whole MPG culture via upregulation of caspase 3 gene expression (P < .05). Nitrergic neurons were markedly decreased in irradiated dissociated culture (P < .05), while nNOS gene expression was upregulated in irradiated whole organ culture (P < .05). The proportion of dissociated sympathetic neurons and whole organ TH gene expression remained unchanged after RT. Interestingly, RT dissociated neurites were 22% shorter than controls, while RT whole organ neurites were 15% longer than controls (P < .01). MPG Schwann cells markers (Sox10, Krox20) were elevated after RT in whole organ culture.  Clinical translation:   Prostatic RT leads to increased neuronal cell death and less erectogenic nitrergic neurons contributing to ED.  Strengths & limitations:   The advantages of dissociated neuron culture include distinct neurites which are easily measured for apoptosis, length/branching, and specific neuron types. In contrast, whole MPG culture is advantageous as it contains all the supporting cells present in vivo.  Conclusion:   The 2 different culture methods demonstrated opposing neurite growth after RT indicating the importance of supporting cell network to promote pelvic neuron neuritogenesis and survival following RT.

Methods:   A total of 1,917,430 men who underwent at least one health examination in 2009 without a previous diagnosis of any other cancer were tracked through December 2015. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) value for the association between prostate cancer and obesity were analyzed using multiple Cox regression model. Since there was a statistically significant interaction between WC and BMI, a multiple HR for prostate cancer was estimated with stratifying both WC and BMI to control the interaction between WC and BMI.  Results:   Without considering WC as an adjustment factor, very weak association between BMI and prostate cancer development risk was observed. When WC was considered as an adjustment factor, no significant change in the HRs for prostate cancer development beyond the reference BMI was observed in the group with WC < 85 cm in the multivariable-adjusted models. However, in the group with WC ≥ 85 cm, the HRs for prostate cancer increased as the BMI increased beyond the reference BMI. In addition, there was a discrepancy in the trend of prostate cancer development according to BMI among the groups with different categories for WC.  Conclusion:   In groups with abdominal obesity, a significant linear relationship was observed between increasing BMI and prostate cancer risk. Higher the WC category, the stronger was the association with BMI, signifying that the association of BMI with risk of prostate cancer development depends on abdominal obesity.""","""['Jin Bong Choi', 'Jun-Pyo Myong', 'Yunhee Lee', 'Inah Kim', 'Jung Ho Kim', 'Sung-Hoo Hong', 'U-Syn Ha']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Association of body mass index with bladder cancer risk in men depends on abdominal obesity.', 'Abdominal obesity increases risk for esophageal cancer: a nationwide population-based cohort study of South Korea.', 'Abdominal obesity as risk factor for prostate cancer diagnosis and high grade disease: a prospective multicenter Italian cohort study.', 'Relationship between Central Obesity and the incidence of Cognitive Impairment and Dementia from Cohort Studies Involving 5,060,687 Participants.', 'Waist Circumference and Risk of Liver Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of over 2 Million Cohort Study Participants.', 'Prostate imaging-reporting and data system version 2 in combination with clinical parameters for prostate cancer detection: a single center experience.', 'Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: learning curves and outcomes from an Australian perspective.', 'Big Data Research in the Field of Endocrine Diseases Using the Korean National Health Information Database.', 'Obesity and endocrine-related cancer: The important role of IGF-1.', 'Dual contribution of the mTOR pathway and of the metabolism of amino acids in prostate cancer.']"""

Immune surveillance has emerged as an effective approach for early detection and to monitor disease progression. In recent studies, we have shown that host peripheral blood immune cells undergo changes in DNA methylation in liver and breast cancer.  Methods:   In the current study, we examined the DNA methylation status of peripheral blood T cells of men with positive biopsy for PCa versus men with negative biopsy having benign prostate tissue, defined as controls. T cells DNA was isolated and subjected to Illumina Infinium methylation EPIC array and validated using Illumina amplicon sequencing and pyrosequencing platforms.  Results:   Differential methylation of 449 CG sites between control and PCa T cell DNA showed a correlation with Gleason score (p < 0.05). Two hundred twenty-three differentially methylated CGs between control and PCa (∆ß +/- 10%, p < 0.05), were enriched in pathways involved in immune surveillance system. Three CGs which were found differentially methylated following DMP (Differentially methylated probes) analysis of ChAMP remained significant after BH (Benjamini-Hochberg) correction, of which, 2 CGs were validated. Predictive ability of combination of these 3 CGs (polygenic methylation score, PMS) to detect PCa had high sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy. PMS also showed strong positive correlation with Gleason score and tumor volume of PCa patients.  Conclusions:   Results from the current study provide for the first-time a potential role of DNA methylation changes in peripheral T cells in PCa. This non-invasive methodology may allow for early intervention and stratification of patients into different prognostic groups to reduce PCa associated morbidity from repeat invasive prostate biopsies and design therapeutic strategy to reduce PCa associated mortality.""","""['Ali Mehdi', 'David Cheishvili', 'Ani Arakelian', 'Tarek A Bismar', 'Moshe Szyf', 'Shafaat A Rabbani']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['DNA methylation signatures of breast cancer in peripheral T-cells.', 'Risk score predicts high-grade prostate cancer in DNA-methylation positive, histopathologically negative biopsies.', 'Random forest-based modelling to detect biomarkers for prostate cancer progression.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Blood-based and urinary prostate cancer biomarkers: a review and comparison of novel biomarkers for detection and treatment decisions.', 'A multiplex blood-based assay targeting DNA methylation in PBMCs enables early detection of breast cancer.', 'Diagnostic value of integrated 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/MRI compared with that of biparametric MRI for the detection of prostate cancer.', 'Epigenome-Wide Association Study of Prostate Cancer in African Americans Identifies DNA Methylation Biomarkers for Aggressive Disease.']"""

The spatial patterns of breast and prostate cancer in Slovakia were examined by means of spatial autocorrelation analyses with the Local Moran's I and Anselin Local Moran's statistics. Data on standardized death rates of breast and prostate cancer in Slovakia between 2001 and 2018 were used. Prostate cancer in men and breast cancer in women show a positive statistically significant Global Moran's I, whose values indicate a tendency to cluster. The Anselin Local Moran's I analysis indicates significant clusters of breast cancer in the western part of Slovakia, and prostate cancer clusters mostly in the central part of Slovakia.

The objective of the study was to determine whether this polymorphism is associated with outcomes for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide.  Patients and methods:   A total of 547 patients treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide from two prospective cohorts were evaluated. The HSD3B1 genotype was determined by targeted sequencing and/or TaqMan single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping. In cohort 1, patients were randomized to receive abiraterone + prednisone or enzalutamide. In cohort 2, patients received either agent according to investigator's choice. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate, time to PSA progression (TTPP), time to progression (TTP) and overall survival were determined. Associations between HSD3B1 genotypes and outcomes were evaluated via univariate Cox regression. Multivariable Cox model was used to determine the independent association of each covariate.  Results:   The HSD3B1 variant genotype (CC) was present in 15% of patients and was associated with worse TTP [hazard ratio (HR) 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.67, P = 0.032] and PSA response rates (48% for CC versus 62% and 65% for AA and AC, respectively [P = 0.019]), with no significant difference in TTPP (HR 1.28, 95% CI 0.99-1.66, P = 0.064). The effect of genotype was similar for treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide with a negative test for interaction for TTPP (P = 0.997) and TTP (P = 0.749). Multivariable analysis did not show a significant association between genotype and TTP or TTPP.  Conclusions:   The HSD3B1 (CC) genotype was associated with shorter TTP and lower PSA response rate in patients with mCRPC treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide.

Objectives:   We aimed to assess the role of leptin and its receptors as potential biomarkers for the risk of PCa development and aggressiveness.  Methods:   In this study, 176 men were included and categorized according to an established histopathological diagnosis into three age- and BMI-matched groups.

Methods:   A multicenter, randomized, phase 3 trial enrolled 303 patients with locally advanced PCa between 2001 and 2006. Participants were treated with neoadjuvant ADT for 6 months. Then, 280 patients whose prostate-specific antigen levels were less than pretreatment levels and less than 10 ng/mL were randomized. All 280 participants were treated with 72 Gy of EBRT in combination with adjuvant ADT for 8 months.

TMPRSS2-ERG fusion transcript leads to the androgen induction of ERG proto-oncogenes expression, representing a high presence of oncogenes alteration among prostate tumour cells.  Aim:   The aim of this research was to detect and evaluate theTMPRSS2-ERG fuse transcript in the tissues of patients with prostate cancer, and establish a base of material of these samples for further genetic examination.  Materials and methods:   The research was a prospective clinical study that involved and focused on random sampling of 101 patients (62 with prostate cancer-study group and 39 with benign changes in the prostate-control group). Real time PCR analysis for detection of the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion transcript in prostate tissue was performed and also data from the histopathology results of tissues were used, as well as data for the level of PSA (prostate-specific antigen) in blood.  Results:   TMPRSS2-ERG fusion transcript was detected in 20 out of 62 (32.2%) patients with prostate carcinoma and among no patients with benign changes whatsoever. There were no significant differences between patients with/without detected TMPRSS2-ERG fusion related to Gleason score. Among 50%, in the study group this score was greater than 7 per/for Median IQR=7 (6-8). Significant difference was recognized, related to the average value of PSA in favour of significantly higher value of PSA in the study group with prostate cancer, but there was also no significant difference between samples with prostate cancer who were with/without detected TMPRSS2-ERG fusion transcript related to PSA level.  Discussion:   The results from this research are in accordance with the values and results from analyses done in several research centres and oncological institutes.  Conclusion:   The positive findings in small scale studies encourage the implementation of larger scale studies that will be enriched with results of genetic transcript in blood and urine and will define the positive diagnostic meaning of the TMPRSS-ERG fusion transcript.""","""['Aleksandar Trifunovski', 'Aleksandar Dimovski', 'Sasho Dohcev', 'Sotir Stavridis', 'Oliver Stankov', 'Skender Saidi', 'Marija Gjorgjievska', 'Zivko Popov']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Pril (Makedon Akad Nauk Umet Odd Med Nauki)""","""['Urine TMPRSS2:ERG fusion transcript stratifies prostate cancer risk in men with elevated serum PSA.', 'Urine TMPRSS2:ERG fusion transcript integrated with PCA3 score, genotyping, and biological features are correlated to the results of prostatic biopsies in men at risk of prostate cancer.', 'Combining urinary detection of TMPRSS2:ERG and PCA3 with serum PSA to predict diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Urine TMPRSS2: ERG Fusion Transcript as a Biomarker for Prostate Cancer: Literature Review.']"""

X-ray is the primary imaging modality, but magnetic resonance imaging study, computed tomography scan, and nuclear medicine studies also may help identify the site of the primary tumor and extent of metastatic disease. The diagnosis is confirmed with surgical or percutaneous biopsy. Patients with bone metastases are at risk of pathologic fractures, and measures should be taken to prevent these, such as avoidance of weight-bearing on affected extremities or surgical fixation. Patients also should receive, as appropriate for the type of cancer, chemotherapy, radiation, and other treatments.

The development of an accurate loci-specific methylation assay, suitable for use on low-input clinical material, is crucial for advancing DNA methylation biomarkers into a clinical setting. A targeted multiplex bisulphite PCR sequencing approach meets these needs by allowing multiple DNA methylated regions to be interrogated simultaneously in one experiment on limited clinical material.  Results:   Here, we provide an updated protocol and recommendations for multiplex bisulphite PCR sequencing (MBPS) assays for target DNA methylation analysis. We describe additional steps to improve performance and reliability: (1) pre-sequencing PCR optimisation which includes assessing the optimal PCR cycling temperature and primer concentration and (2) post-sequencing PCR optimisation to achieve uniform coverage of each amplicon. We use a gradient of methylated controls to demonstrate how PCR bias can be assessed and corrected. Methylated controls also allow assessment of the sensitivity of methylation detection for each amplicon. Here, we show that the MBPS assay can amplify as little as 0.625 ng starting DNA and can detect methylation differences of 1% with a sequencing coverage of 1000 reads. Furthermore, the multiplex bisulphite PCR assay can comprehensively interrogate multiple regions on 1-5 ng of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded DNA or circulating cell-free DNA.  Conclusions:   The MBPS assay is a valuable approach for assessing methylated DNA regions in clinical samples with limited material. The optimisation and additional quality control steps described here improve the performance and reliability of this method, advancing it towards potential clinical applications in biomarker studies.""","""['Dilys Lam', 'Phuc-Loi Luu', 'Jenny Z Song', 'Wenjia Qu', 'Gail P Risbridger', 'Mitchell G Lawrence', 'Jennifer Lu', 'Matt Trau', 'Darren Korbie', 'Susan J Clark', 'Ruth Pidsley', 'Clare Stirzaker']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Epigenetics""","""['Guidelines for whole genome bisulphite sequencing of intact and FFPET DNA on the Illumina HiSeq X Ten.', 'Multiplexed and Sensitive DNA Methylation Testing Using Methylation-Sensitive Restriction Enzymes ""MSRE-qPCR"".', 'Application of Multiplex Bisulfite PCR-Ligase Detection Reaction-Real-Time Quantitative PCR Assay in Interrogating Bioinformatically Identified, Blood-Based Methylation Markers for Colorectal Cancer.', 'Perspective of DNA methylation in forensic genetics and new progress of its detection methods.', 'Single-Cell DNA Methylation Profiling: Technologies and Biological Applications.', 'Targeted DNA methylation from cell-free DNA using hybridization\xa0probe capture.', 'Deeper insights into transcriptional features of cancer-associated fibroblasts: An integrated meta-analysis of single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing data.', 'Assessment of the Feasibility of a Future Integrated Larger-Scale Epidemiological Study to Evaluate Health Risks of Air Pollution Episodes in Children.', 'REASSURED Multiplex Diagnostics: A Critical Review and Forecast.', 'Epigenetic Therapies and Biomarkers in Breast Cancer.']"""

These SGARIs have similar efficacy but differ in safety profiles. We used a discrete choice experiment to explore how United States physicians make treatment decisions between adverse events (AEs) and survival gains in nmCRPC, a largely asymptomatic disease.  Methods:   Treating physicians (n = 149) participated in an online survey that included 14 treatment choice questions, each comparing 2 hypothetical treatment profiles, which varied in terms of 5 safety and 2 efficacy attributes. We described safety attributes (fatigue, skin rash, cognitive problems, falls, and fractures) in terms of severity and frequency, and efficacy attributes (overall survival [OS] and time to pain progression) in terms of duration of effect. We used a random parameters logit model to estimate preference weights and importance scores for each attribute. We also estimated the amount of survival gain physicians were willing to trade for a reduction in specific AEs between treatment options.  Results:   Physicians placed more importance on survival than on time to pain progression, and viewed a reduction in cognitive problems from severe to none, a reduction in risk of a serious fracture from 8% to none, and a reduction in fatigue from severe to none as the most important safety attributes. Physicians were willing to forego 9.1 and 6.6 months of OS, respectively, to reduce cognitive problems and fatigue from severe to mild-to-moderate. To reduce the risk of a serious fracture from 8 to 5% and 5% to none, physicians were willing to trade 3.9 and 5.3 months of OS, respectively.  Conclusions:   Physicians were willing to trade substantial amounts of survival to avoid AEs between hypothetical treatments. These results emphasize the importance of carefully balancing therapies' benefits and risks to ultimately optimize the overall quality of nmCRPC patients' survival. Nonetheless, it is noted that the results from the study sample of 149 physicans may not be representative of the viewpoints of all nmCRPC-treating physicians.""","""['Sandy Srinivas', 'Ateesha F Mohamed', 'Sreevalsa Appukkuttan', 'Marc Botteman', 'Xinyi Ng', 'Namita Joshi', 'Erica Horodniceanu', 'A Reginald Waldeck', 'Stacey J Simmons']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Understanding Treatment Strategies and Preferences in Nonmetastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer From the Japanese Physician Perspective.', 'Patient and caregiver benefit-risk preferences for nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treatment.', 'Understanding what matters to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients when considering treatment options: A US patient preference survey.', 'Darolutamide for non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: Efficacy, safety, and clinical perspectives of use.', 'Darolutamide: A new drug for non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Functional impact of androgen-targeted therapy on patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The Hospitalization-Related Costs of Adverse Events for Novel Androgen Receptor Inhibitors in Non-Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: An Indirect Comparison.', 'Understanding Treatment Strategies and Preferences in Nonmetastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer From the Japanese Physician Perspective.', 'Darolutamide: A Review in Non-Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

Our study aimed at exploring the concept and experience of survivorship for Mexicans living with breast, cervical, and prostate cancer.  Methods:   We conducted a qualitative study in Mexico City, Morelos, Nuevo León, and Puebla. The participants were breast, cervical, and prostate cancer patients ≥18 years of age with completed primary cancer treatment. Data were collected via in-depth interviews and analyzed using an inductive thematic approach.  Results:   The study included 22 participants with a history of breast, 20 cervical, and 18 prostate cancer. Participants accepted the term ""cancer survivor"" as a literal interpretation of being alive, medical confirmation of treatment completion, or achievement of a clinical result possibly indicative of cure. The majority of respondents perceived that the future is out of their control and under God's will. They linked cure to divine intervention and did not demonstrate the sense of empowerment that is often associated with the survivorship term. The principal themes of their narratives encompass: 1) adverse physical and sexual experiences; 2) emotional problems; 3) cancer-related stigma; 4) challenges to obtaining health-related information; 5) financial hardship; and 6) experience of strengthening family ties in order to provide them with support. In addition, women with breast cancer reported distress caused by changes in body image and positive experience with support groups.  Conclusion:   In Mexico, cancer patients report complex survivorship experiences that demand post-treatment follow-up and support. There is the need to implement comprehensive, culturally-relevant survivorship programs focused on emotional, informational, and in-kind support and empowerment of cancer patients.""","""['Felicia Marie Knaul', 'Svetlana V Doubova', 'María Cecilia Gonzalez Robledo', 'Alessandra Durstine', 'Gabriela Sophia Pages', 'Felicia Casanova', 'Hector Arreola-Ornelas']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['The psychosocial experiences of women with breast cancer across the lifespan: a systematic review protocol.', 'Survivor loneliness of women following breast cancer.', 'A dyadic approach to understanding the impact of breast cancer on relationships between partners during early survivorship.', 'Breast cancer experience and survivorship among Asian Americans: a systematic review.', 'Understanding acceptability of and engagement with Web-based interventions aiming to improve quality of life in cancer survivors: A synthesis of current research.', 'Construction of a cutoff and fusion model of breast cancer patients in family: a grounded theory study.', '""I\'m Not Fighting Anymore So What Do I Do Now?""

Case Report""","""Background:   Many studies show the occurrence of several multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes caused by different mutations, for example, in MEN1 and RET genes. Nevertheless, there are less common mutations causing multiple endocrine glands tumors. Examples of such mutations are CHEK2 gene mutations, causing breast, kidney, gastric, colorectal, prostate, lung, ovarian, and thyroid cancers.  Case description:   In 2005, a 30-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital due to uncontrolled hypertension and obesity. Performed tests have shown ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone)-independent micronodular adrenal hyperplasia (AIMAH) as a cause. In 2010, the further diagnostic analysis revealed Cushing's disease caused by ACTH-secreting pituitary microadenoma. Additionally, in 2011, the patient underwent the strumectomy of multinodular struma. Papillary thyroid carcinoma was found in the excised tissue. In 2018, transvaginal ultrasonography revealed a tumor of the right ovary. After a performed hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, the histopathology result has shown female adnexal tumors of probable Wolffian origin (FATWO) located in the broad ligament of the uterus. Due to the history of multiglandular diseases, the patient was referred to genetic testing. We found a positive pathogenic mutation in CHEK2-suppressor gene involved in DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in response to DNA damage.  Conclusion:   CHEK2 variants may predispose to a range of endocrine glands tumors, including those identified in our patient. Multiple endocrine glands tumors, as in the presented patient, are a serious problem of public health, due to numerous hospitalizations and necessary repeated surgical treatments. Moreover, the association between CHEK2 and ovarian cancer can be a serious problem with reproductive health.""","""['Anna Szeliga', 'Aleksandra Pralat', 'Wiktoria Witczak', 'Agnieszka Podfigurna', 'Cezary Wojtyla', 'Anna Kostrzak', 'Blazej Meczekalski']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Environ Res Public Health""","""['CHEK2 mutations and the risk of papillary thyroid cancer.', ""Non-cushingoid Cushing's syndrome due to adrenocorticotropic hormone-independent bilateral adrenocortical macronodular hyperplasia."", 'A case of ACTH-independent macronodular adrenal hyperplasia associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1.', 'Clinical genetics of multiple endocrine neoplasias, Carney complex and related syndromes.', 'Genetic testing in multiple endocrine neoplasia and related syndromes.', 'Case report: Two sisters with a germline CHEK2 variant and distinct endocrine neoplasias.', 'Recurrent Acromegaly in a Patient With a CHEK2 Mutation.', 'Susceptibility Genes and Chromosomal Regions Associated With Non-Syndromic Familial Non-Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma: Some Pathogenetic and Diagnostic Keys.']"""

Yet the risk of impaired cognition or Alzheimer disease (AD) in men with prostate cancer receiving ADT is uncertain. Some studies of prostate cancer and ADT suggest that the risk of AD is not increased. But other studies have found an increased risk of AD and cognitive impairment.  Objectives:   As the uncertainty about ADT and dementia might relate to the genetics of prostate cancer and AD, the authors used the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to examine the relationship in men with prostate cancer between genes implicated in AD and genes implicated in prostate cancer.  Methods:   The authors examined the genomics of 492 prostate cancer cases in the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) TCGA Prostate Cancer (PRAD) data set. To access and analyze the data, 2 web-based interfaces were used: (1) the UCSC Xena browser, a web-based visual integration and exploration tool for TCGA data, including clinical and phenotypic annotations; and (2) cBioportal, a web-based interface that enables integrative analysis of complex cancer genomics and clinical profiles.  Results:   Co-occurrence analysis indicates that alterations in the prostate cancer gene Speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) significantly co-occur with alterations in the AD gene BIN1 (P<0.001). The presence of somatic mutations (deleterious and missense/in frame) in SPOP deranges BIN1 gene expression. SPOP/BIN1 RNA gene expression in 492 prostate cancer specimens is significantly correlated (P<0.001). Increased expression of SPOP in 492 prostate cancers is associated with reduced survival (P=0.00275). Men receiving pharmacologic therapy had a tumor with a significantly higher Gleason score (P=0.023). Gleason score and BIN1 RNA gene expression, unit log2 (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads upper quartile [FPKM-UQ]+1), in 499 prostate cancer specimens were significantly inversely correlated (P<0.001).  Conclusions:   BIN1 forms part of a network that interacts with the MYC oncogene, activated at the earliest phases of prostate cancer and in its position on chr8q24 linked to disease aggressiveness. Dynamic regulation of the BIN1-Tau interaction is involved in AD. BIN1 loss in AD allows phosphorylated tau to be mis-sorted to synapses, which likely alters the integrity of the postsynapse, alongside reducing the functionally important release of physiological forms of tau. Alzheimer symptoms are usually preceded by a preclinical phase that may be 16 years long. The authors suggest that the ADT dosage reflects the severity of a process that is already underway. The severity is determined by the genetics of the tumor itself, at least in part by BIN1. ADT is not causing new cases of AD. The oncologist treats higher-grade prostate cancer with more ADT, which serves as a surrogate marker for disease severity. Our analysis of TCGA data does not support the idea that ADT causes AD or dementia.""","""['Steven Lehrer', 'Peter H Rheinstein']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Am J Clin Oncol""","""[""Co-occurrent Alterations of Alzheimer's Genes and Prostate Cancer Genes in Prostate Cancer."", 'Association Between Androgen Deprivation Therapy Use and Diagnosis of Dementia in Men With Prostate Cancer.', ""The Mechanistic Role of Bridging Integrator 1 (BIN1) in Alzheimer's Disease."", 'Increased expression of BIN1 mediates Alzheimer genetic risk by modulating tau pathology.', 'Neuropsychiatric Impact of Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Patients with Prostate Cancer: Current Evidence and Recommendations for the Clinician.', 'The Relationship between Cancer and Dementia: An Updated Review.', 'Assessment and Management of Cognitive Function in Patients with Prostate Cancer Treated with Second-Generation Androgen Receptor Pathway Inhibitors.']"""

Previous studies suggest that abnormal glycosylation of immunoglobulin gamma molecules (IgGs) is strongly associated with immunological diseases and prostate diseases. Hence, characterizing N-linked intact glycopeptides of IgGs that correspond to the N-glycan structure with specific site information might enable a better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis and discovery of novel signatures in preoperative discrimination of BPH from PCa. In this study, we profiled N-linked intact glycopeptides of purified IgGs from 51 PCa patients and 45 BPH patients by our developed N-glycoproteomic method using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography enrichment coupled with high resolution LC-MS/MS. The quantitative analysis of the N-linked intact glycopeptides using pGlyco 2.0 and MaxQuant software provided quantitative information on plasma IgG subclass-specific and site-specific N-glycosylation. As a result, we found four aberrantly expressed N-linked intact glycopeptides across different IgG subclasses. In particular, the N-glycopeptide IgG2-GP09 (EEQFNSTFR (H5N5S1)) was dramatically elevated in plasma from PCa patients, compared with that in BPH patients (PCa/BPH ratio = 5.74, p = 0.001). Additionally, the variations in these N-linked intact glycopeptide abundances were not caused by the changes in the IgG concentrations. Furthermore, IgG2-GP09 displayed a more powerful prediction capability (auROC = 0.702) for distinguishing PCa from BPH than the clinical index t-PSA (auROC = 0.681) when used alone or in combination with other indicators (auROC = 0.853). In conclusion, these abnormally expressed N-linked intact glycopeptides have potential for non-invasive monitoring and pre-stratification of prostate diseases.""","""['Yong Zhang', 'Tianhai Lin', 'Yang Zhao', 'Yonghong Mao', 'Yiran Tao', 'Yan Huang', 'Shisheng Wang', 'Liqiang Hu', 'Jingqiu Cheng', 'Hao Yang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Analyst""","""['Recent advances in glycopeptide enrichment and mass spectrometry data interpretation approaches for glycoproteomics analyses.', 'In prostatism patients the ratio of human glandular kallikrein to free PSA improves the discrimination between prostate cancer and benign hyperplasia within the diagnostic ""gray zone"" of total PSA 4 to 10 ng/mL.', 'Distinct urinary glycoprotein signatures in prostate cancer patients.', 'Analysis of Urinary Prostate-Specific Antigen Glycoforms in Samples of Prostate Cancer and Benign Prostate Hyperplasia.', 'Lectins applied to diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer and benign hyperplasia: A review.', 'Comparative N-Glycoproteomics Analysis of Clinical Samples Via Different Mass Spectrometry Dissociation Methods.', 'Methods for quantification of glycopeptides by liquid separation and mass spectrometry.']"""

The current study aimed to elucidate the functional role of the gene glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in CRPC, and identify the contributions of the GR gene in CRPC in connection with microRNA-143-3p (miR-143-3p)/Jagged1 (JAG1)/NOTCH2.  Methods:   The expression of GR and miR-143-3p in CRPC tissues and cells as well as JAG1/NOTCH2 expression in CRPC tissues was initially determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses. The relationship among GR, JAG1, NOTCH2 and miR-143-3p was subsequently verified using the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. ChIP assay confirmed the binding of GR to miR-143-3p promoter. Gain- and loss-function approaches were applied to ascertain the role of GR and miR-143-3p in progression of CRPC. Additionally, xenograft tumor models in nude mice were established to further confirm our results.  Results:   GR was found to be highly expressed while miR-143-3p was lowly expressed in the CRPC tissues and cells. Silencing GR reduced migration, invasion, proliferation and increased apoptosis of CRPC cells. GR was enriched in the miR-143-3p promoter region and could down-regulate miR-143-3p expression. The overexpression of miR-143-3p led to a reduction in the migration, invasion, proliferation and increased apoptosis of CRPC cells. JAG1 and NOTCH2 were the target genes of miR-143-3p, and GR up-regulated the JAG1/NOTCH2 expression by down-regulating miR-143-3p. Silencing JAG1/NOTCH2 inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition and CRPC progression in vitro. Furthermore, the in vitro findings were reproduced in the in vivo experiments.  Conclusion:   The key findings of the current study demonstrated that silencing GR suppressed the progression of CRPC through the JAG1/NOTCH2 pathway via up-regulation of miR-143-3p.""","""['Linshen Zhang', 'Hongjun Jiang', 'Yufan Zhang', 'Chenrong Wang', 'Xixi Xia', 'Yi Sun']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Biomark""","""['miR-598 inhibits metastasis in colorectal cancer by suppressing JAG1/Notch2 pathway stimulating EMT.', 'MicroRNA-144-3p inhibits cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis in castration-resistant prostate cancer by targeting CEP55.', 'MicroRNA-34a Attenuates Paclitaxel Resistance in Prostate Cancer Cells via Direct Suppression of JAG1/Notch1 Axis.', 'The Crosstalk of Long Non-Coding RNA and MicroRNA in Castration-Resistant and Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer: Their Interaction and Clinical Importance.', 'The role of microRNA in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'SOX8 Knockdown Overcomes Enzalutamide Resistance in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer by Inhibiting the Notch Signaling Pathway.', 'Role of germline variants in the metastasis of breast carcinomas.', 'Kaempferol Inhibits Hepatic Stellate Cell Activation by Regulating miR-26b-5p/Jag1 Axis and Notch Pathway.']"""

Nonetheless, automatic segmentation is challenging due to the lack of clear prostate boundaries owing to the similar appearance of prostate and surrounding tissues and the wide variation in size and shape among different patients ascribed to pathological changes or different resolutions of images. In this regard, the state-of-the-art includes methods based on a probabilistic atlas, active contour models, and deep learning techniques. However, these techniques have limitations that need to be addressed, such as MRI scans with the same spatial resolution, initialization of the prostate region with well-defined contours and a set of hyperparameters of deep learning techniques determined manually, respectively. Therefore, this paper proposes an automatic and novel coarse-to-fine segmentation method for prostate 3D MRI scans. The coarse segmentation step combines local texture and spatial information using the Intrinsic Manifold Simple Linear Iterative Clustering algorithm and probabilistic atlas in a deep convolutional neural networks model jointly with the particle swarm optimization algorithm to classify prostate and non-prostate tissues. Then, the fine segmentation uses the 3D Chan-Vese active contour model to obtain the final prostate surface. The proposed method has been evaluated on the Prostate 3T and PROMISE12 databases presenting a dice similarity coefficient of 84.86%, relative volume difference of 14.53%, sensitivity of 90.73%, specificity of 99.46%, and accuracy of 99.11%.

A published study reported reclassification of some BRCA1/2 variants previously classified as variants of uncertain significance (VUS) to likely pathogenic in breast or ovarian cancer patients from Korea.

Methods:   We retrospectively retrieved 109 publications studying about BRCA1/2 variants of Chinese population from the year 1999 to year 2019 (March). After excluding publications of meta-analysis and publications with missing data, 72 publications were eventually retained for subsequent analysis. In total, 1,351 BRCA variants (673 BRCA1 variants and 678 BRCA2 variants) derived from 42,430 Chinese cancer patients were standardized and reinterpreted using ACMG/AMP 2015 guidelines and China Expert Consensus on BRCA variant interpretation by genetic counselors.  Results:   Among the 1,351 BRCA variants, the majority of interpretation (91.7%, 1,239/1,351) remained the same as previously published. However, there were 112 (8.3%, 112/1,351) variants (64 BRCA1, 48 BRCA2) reclassified with different categories.

Some circulatory cytokines are believed to play an important role in RT resistance and lead to tumour progression, invasion, and angiogenesis. The aim of this study is to assess the influence of ADT and RT on the expression of circulatory cytokines levels in plasma at different time points.  Methods:   Between Nov 2015 and Aug 2016, 18 patients with localized PC were selected for this clinical study. All patients had received neoadjuvant ADT using a leuteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) analogs prior to RT. Peripheral blood samples were collected prior to ADT, before RT, at the end of RT and 3 months after the completion of RT. Blood plasma samples were monitored for the pro-inflammatory and profibrotic cytokines TNF-α, TGF-β1, IL-6, and IL-8, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) procedures.  Results:   The concentration of TGF-β1 rose while IL-6 levels declined in post-ADT samples when compared pre-ADT. Levels of TGF-β1 increased in post-RT blood plasma compared to pre-RT blood plasma. Those changes were not statically significant. Three months post-RT completion, TGF-β1 levels decreased and IL-6 and IL-8 levels increased. Although levels of TGF-β1, IL-6 and IL-8 were found to be altered 3 months post-RT completion, only changes in IL-8 levels were found to be statistically significant (P=0.05).  Conclusions:   In conclusion the changes in cytokines levels have been found after ADT and RT, which strengthen the finding of other clinical studies.

However, almost all patients relapse with castration-resistant disease (CRPC) when treated with anti-androgen therapy. In CRPC, AR is often aberrantly activated independent of androgen. Targeting survival pathways downstream of AR could be a viable strategy to overcome CRPC. Surprisingly, little is known about how AR drives prostate cancer survival. Furthermore, CRPC tumors in which Pten is lost are also resistant to eradication by PI3K inhibitors. We sought to identify the mechanism by which AR drives tumor survival in CRPC to identify ways to overcome resistance to PI3K inhibition. We found that integrins α6β1 and Bnip3 are selectively elevated in CRPC downstream of AR. While integrin α6 promotes survival and is a direct transcriptional target of AR, the ability of AR to induce Bnip3 is dependent on adhesion to laminin and integrin α6β1-dependent nuclear translocation of HIF1α. Integrins α6β1 and Bnip3 were found to promote survival of CRPC cells selectively on laminin through the induction of autophagy and mitophagy. Furthermore, blocking Bnip3 or integrin α6β1 restored sensitivity to PI3K inhibitors in Pten-negative CRPC. We identified an AR driven pathway that cooperates with laminin and hypoxia to drive resistance to PI3K inhibitors. These findings can help explain in part why PI3K inhibitors have failed in clinical trials to overcome AR-dependent CRPC.""","""['Eric A Nollet', 'Marina Cardo-Vila', 'Sourik S Ganguly', 'Jack D Tran', 'Veronique V Schulz', 'Anne Cress', 'Eva Corey', 'Cindy K Miranti']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['The androgen receptor induces integrin α6β1 to promote prostate tumor cell survival via NF-κB and Bcl-xL Independently of PI3K signaling.', 'Hypoxia-induced PIM kinase and laminin-activated integrin α6 mediate resistance to PI3K inhibitors in bone-metastatic CRPC.', 'Src promotes castration-recurrent prostate cancer through androgen receptor-dependent canonical and non-canonical transcriptional signatures.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Androgen receptor functions in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance to new agents targeting the androgen axis.', 'Endostatin 33 Peptide Is a Deintegrin α6β1 Agent That Exerts Antitumor Activity by Inhibiting the PI3K-Akt Signaling Pathway in Prostate Cancer.', 'The Emerging Role of Cell Adhesion Molecules on Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.', 'Establishment of a novel prognostic prediction model through bioinformatics analysis for prostate cancer based on ferroptosis-related genes and its application in immune cell infiltration.', 'Targeting autophagy in prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic response.', 'Growth, Proliferation and Metastasis of Prostate Cancer Cells Is Blocked by Low-Dose Curcumin in Combination with Light Irradiation.']"""

We previously showed that prostate RT increased RhoA/ROCK signaling in the cavernous nerve (CN) and penile tissues, which may lead to RiED in rats. In this study, we investigated whether RhoA/ROCK pathway inhibition by a specific inhibitor called Hydroxyfasudil (HF) can improve RiED in our well-established rat model.  Materials/methods:   Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to the following groups: sham-RT, HF-only, RT-only, and RT + HF. Rats were either exposed to a single dose of 25 Gy prostate-confined RT or a sham procedure. 10 mg/kg HF or normal saline was injected intraperitoneally. Erectile function was evaluated by intracavernosal pressure (ICP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) measurements at week 14 post-RT. Cavernous nerve (CN) injury was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and penile tissue fibrosis by Masson trichrome staining (MT).  Results:   We have found that the HF treatment prior to RT showed significant (p < 0.001) improvement in ICP/MAP ratio, area under the curve, and maximum ICP value, compared to RT-alone rats. Furthermore, RT + HF treated rats exhibited increased CN myelination and decreased axonal atrophy, comparted to RT-only.

Methods and materials:   Patients with localized prostate cancer with Gleason score ≤7, clinical stage T1b to T3a, and prostate-specific antigen <30 ng/mL were randomized to neoadjuvant and concurrent ADT for 6 months starting 4 months before prostate radiation therapy (NHT arm) or concurrent and adjuvant ADT for 6 months starting simultaneously with radiation therapy (CAHT arm). Full testosterone recovery (FTR) was defined as recovery of testosterone to >10.5 nmol/L in patients with baseline ≥10.5 nmol/L or to baseline level in patients with baseline <10.5 nmol/L. Restricted mean survival time (RMST) since ADT initiation to supracastrate testosterone level (>1.7 nmol/L), and to FTR was compared between the arms using a truncation time point of 36 months.  Results:   The adjusted difference in RMST to supracastrate testosterone between the CAHT and NHT arm was 1.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-2.5; P = .005). No difference was noted in RMST to FTR between the arms (18.7 vs 18.5 months, adjusted difference: 0.5; 95% CI, -1.4 to 2.4; P = .61). There was no evidence of heterogeneity of treatment effect (interaction P = .76) on risk of relapse over subgroups stratified by testosterone recovery to supracastrate level at 15 months after start of ADT. Based on a multistate Markov model, no independent effect of time to FTR on risk of subsequent relapse was observed (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.02; 95% CI, 0.96-1.08).  Conclusions:   Patients should be counseled that an additional 12 months on average is needed for FTR to occur after treatment with prostate radiation therapy and 6 months of ADT. This is independent of the sequencing of ADT and radiation therapy. Furthermore, recovery of testosterone does not appear to affect the risk of subsequent relapse.""","""['Soumyajit Roy', 'Scott Grimes', 'Libni Eapen', 'Daniel E Spratt', 'Julia Malone', 'Julia Craig', 'Scott C Morgan', 'Shawn Malone']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Duration of androgen deprivation therapy and nadir of testosterone at 20 ng/dL predict testosterone recovery to supracastrate level in prostate cancer patients who received external beam radiotherapy.', 'Oncological outcomes for patients with locally advanced prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant endocrine and external-beam radiation therapy followed by adjuvant continuous/intermittent endocrine therapy in an open-label, randomized, phase 3 trial.', 'A Phase II, Randomized, Multicenter Study Comparing 10 Months versus 4 Months of Degarelix Therapy in Prolonging the Off Treatment Interval in Men with Localized Prostate Cancer Receiving Intermittent Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Biochemical Recurrence following Radical Local Therapy.', 'Use of androgen deprivation and salvage radiation therapy for patients with prostate cancer and biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy.', 'Serum testosterone levels after medical or surgical androgen deprivation: a comprehensive review of the literature.', 'Sequencing of Androgen-Deprivation Therapy of Short Duration With Radiotherapy for Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer (SANDSTORM): A Pooled Analysis of 12 Randomized Trials.']"""

In this study, we evaluated the preliminary results of reirradiation using stereotactic body radiotherapy for locally recurrent prostate cancer after initial definitive local radiotherapy.  Materials and methods:   Between April 2016 and February 2019, 11 patients with recurrent disease at the previously irradiated prostate were treated. Local recurrence was detected by radiological with or without functional imaging modalities including prostate multiparametric/pelvic MRI or positron-emission tomography-computerised tomography with (68Ga)-labelled prostate-specific membrane antigen performed after rising prostate specific antigen serum level during follow-up. All patients received stereotactic body radiotherapy to the recurrent nodule to a total dose of 30Gy in five fractions. Hyaluronic acid spacer was injected between prostate and rectum in seven patients to decrease the rectal dose. Acute toxicity was evaluated by using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0, and late toxicity was evaluated by using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer late radiation morbidity scoring schema.  Results:   At the diagnosis, the median age was 64 years, and the mean prostate specific antigen serum concentration was 17.7ng/mL. The median interval time between local recurrence and initial definitive radiotherapy was 63 months. Mean prostate specific antigen concentration nadir value during follow-up was 0.43ng/mL. With a median follow up of 19 months, three patients developed either local or distant relapse. One patient had grade 3 acute rectal toxicity, and one patient had grade 2 late urinary toxicity. We did not observe any acute or late toxicity due to hyaluronic acid spacer injection.  Conclusion:   Reirradiation after local recurrence following initial definitive radiotherapy together with hyaluronic acid spacer use seems to be effective and safe.""","""['G Ozyigit', 'P Hurmuz', 'D Akinci', 'S C B Esen', 'M T Yilmaz', 'B Akdogan', 'F H Akyol']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Radiother""","""['Interim Results of a Prospective Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Directed Focal Stereotactic Reirradiation Trial for Locally Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'Reirradiation of Locally Recurrent Prostate Cancer With Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy.', 'Robotic image-guided stereotactic radiotherapy, for isolated recurrent primary, lymph node or metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Salvage reirradiation for locoregional failure after radiation therapy for prostate cancer: who, when, where and how?', 'Salvage reirradiation for local prostate cancer recurrence after radiation therapy.

This ability (mainly using monocyte-derived DCs) has been exploited in vaccination strategies for decades with limited clinical efficacy. Another alternative would be the use of conventional DCs (cDCs) of which at least three subsets circulate in human blood: cDC1s (CD141bright), cDC2s (CD1c+) and plasmacytoid DCs. Despite their paucity, technical advances may allow for their selection and clinical use. However, many assumptions concerning the DC subset biology depend on observations from mouse models, hindering their translational potential. In this study, we characterise human DCs in patients with ovarian cancer (OvC) or prostate cancer (PrC).  Patients and methods:   Whole blood samples from patients with OvC or PrC and healthy donors (HDs) were evaluated by flow cytometry for the phenotypic and functional characterisation of DC subsets.  Results:   In both patient groups, the frequency of total CD141+ DCs was lower than that in HDs, but the cDC1 subset was only reduced in patients with OvC. CD141+ DCs showed a reduced response to the TLR3 agonist poly (I:C) in both groups of patients. An inverse correlation between the frequency of cDC1s and CA125, the OvC tumour burden marker, was observed. Consistently, high expression of CLEC9A in OvC tissue (The Cancer Genome Atlas data set) indicated a better overall survival.  Conclusions:   cDC1s are reduced in patients with OvC, and CD141+ DCs are quantitatively and qualitatively impaired in patients with OvC or PrC. CD141+ DC activation may predict functional impairment. The loss of cDC1s may be a bad prognostic factor for patients with OvC.""","""['Beatris Mastelic-Gavillet', 'Apostolos Sarivalasis', 'Leyder Elena Lozano', 'Tania Wyss', 'Susana Inoges', 'Ingrid Jolanda Monique de Vries', 'Florence Dartiguenave', 'Patrice Jichlinski', 'Laurent Derrè', 'George Coukos', 'Ignacio Melero', 'Alexandre Harari', 'Pedro Romero', 'Selena Viganó', 'Lana Elias Kandalaft']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['Increased tubulointerstitial recruitment of human CD141(hi) CLEC9A(+) and CD1c(+) myeloid dendritic cell subsets in renal fibrosis and chronic kidney disease.', 'CD141⁺ myeloid dendritic cells are enriched in healthy human liver.', 'Human CLEC9A antibodies deliver NY-ESO-1 antigen to CD141+ dendritic cells to activate naïve and memory NY-ESO-1-specific CD8+ T cells.', 'The clinical application of cancer immunotherapy based on naturally circulating dendritic cells.', 'Adjuvant for vaccine immunotherapy of cancer--focusing on Toll-like receptor 2 and 3 agonists for safely enhancing antitumor immunity.', 'Crosstalk of Immune Cells and Platelets in an Ovarian Cancer Microenvironment and Their Prognostic Significance.', 'Longitudinal analysis of DC subsets in patients with ovarian cancer: Implications for immunotherapy.', 'The tumor innate immune microenvironment in prostate cancer: an overview of soluble factors and cellular effectors.', 'Dendritic cells transfected with a polyepitope DNA construct stimulate an antitumor cytotoxic response in various tumors.', 'Dendritic Cells: The Long and Evolving Road towards Successful Targetability in Cancer.']"""

Methods and materials:   Selected NRG Oncology trials were included based on disease site and inclusion of PROs and electronic PRO data capture via VisionTree Optimal Care as separate consent questions. Reasons for not participating were assessed. Pretreatment characteristics between patients who did and did not consent were tested using χ2 and t tests for univariate comparisons and logistic regression for multivariable analyses.  Results:   Ten trials were selected in head and neck, prostate, gynecologic, breast, lung, and gastrointestinal cancers, with 4 of these trials having electronic PRO data capture. Most patients consented to the PRO component (75.3%) but not electronic PRO data capture (37.8%). More white patients consented to PROs than nonwhite patients across all trials (odds ratio [OR], 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45-0.63; P < .001), and more patients with education after high school consented compared with those with less education (OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.46-2.02; P < .001).

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-based positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has become increasingly popular as a novel molecular imaging technique capable of improving the clinical management of patients with prostate cancer. To date, several 68Ga and 18F-labeled PSMA-targeted molecules have shown promising results in imaging patients with recurrent prostate cancer using PET/computed tomography (PET/CT). Studies of involving PSMA-targeted radiopharmaceuticals also suggest a higher sensitivity and specificity, along with an improved detection rate over conventional imaging (CT scan and methylene diphosphonate bone scintigraphy) and 11C/18F-choline PET/CT. In addition, PSMA-617 and PSMA I&T ligands can be labeled with α- and β-emitters (e.g., 225Ac, 90Y, and 177Lu) and serve as a theranostic tool for patients with metastatic prostate cancer.

The aim of the current study was to investigate FoR in couples with different types of cancer and to gain a deeper understanding of sex and role-specific differences and predictors of FoR in patients and partners.  Design:   Cross-sectional study in Germany. Sample: N = 188 couples with prostate (PC; n=52), laryngeal (LC; n=21) or breast cancer (BC; n=115) participated. All PC and LC patients were males, all BC patients were females.  Methods:   Fear of recurrence, depression, and relationship satisfaction were measured with validated questionnaires (Fear of Progression Questionnaire, Patient Health Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Quality of Marriage Index) in couples with PC, LC, or BC.  Findings:   Results indicated sex-role-specific differences. For women, FoR was higher for patients (M = 35.76) than for caregivers (M = 27.11). For males, spouses of women with BC (M = 30.1) showed higher FoR than male PC or LC patients (M = 24.9). Moreover, in couples there was a correlation between the FoR of one and the other (PC: r = .51, BC: r = .31, LC: r = .41). Depression was as a significant predictor, with a positive relationship to FoR. Moreover, in men with PC and LC besides depression, age emerged as significant predictor with a negative relationship to FoR. The Actor-Partner-Interdependence-Model showed for couples with PC or LC significant actor effects, both for patients and partners. Moreover, a significant partner effect emerged for patients' depression on partners' FoR. For couples with BC only significant actor effects occurred.  Conclusions:   FoR remains a major concern for both cancer patients and their partners. Implications for Psychosocial Providers or Policy: FoR should be considered both in cancer patients and their spouses. In addition, sex and role effects should be taken into account in treatment of FoR.""","""['Pia Muldbücker', 'Diana Steinmann', 'Hans Christiansen', 'Martina de Zwaan', 'Tanja Zimmermann']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Psychosoc Oncol""","""['Threat sensitivity and fear of cancer recurrence: a daily diary study of reactivity and recovery as patients and spouses face the first mammogram post-diagnosis.', 'Social constraints and fear of recurrence in couples coping with early stage breast cancer.', 'Body image in men with prostate or laryngeal cancer and their female partners.', 'Fear of cancer recurrence: a significant concern among partners of prostate cancer survivors.', 'Partner understanding of the breast and prostate cancer experience.', 'Social relationships and relational pain in brain tumor patients and their partners.', 'Pan-cancer analysis of fear of cancer recurrence among cancer survivors.', 'Social Support and Fear of Cancer Recurrence Among Chinese Breast Cancer Survivors: The Mediation Role of Illness Uncertainty.', '""Partner"", ""Caregiver"", or ""Co-Survivor""-Might the Label We Give the Partners of Cancer Patients Affect the Health Outcome of the Patients and Their Partners?', 'A systematic mixed studies review of fear of cancer recurrence in families and caregivers of adults diagnosed with cancer.']"""

Pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) is recommended in case of intermediate and high-risk localized PCa however symptomatic lymphocele (SL) formation is a common complication. Still no certain clinical and surgical predictors of SL have been found in the robotic era. Aim of this study was to identify clinical and surgical predictors of SL after RARP and PLND.Methods: We retrospectively evaluated all consecutive patients undergone RARP and PLND from 01/2017 to 06/2019, at our institution. All procedures were performed by experienced robotic surgeons. Baseline patients' characteristics, as well as peri- and post-operative features, were recorded and compared among those patients experiencing SL after surgery and those who did not.Results: Overall, 282 patients were included. Of these, 21 (7.5%) developed SL after surgery. Patients with SL showed higher median BMI (30.4 vs 25.8) and a more frequent history of vascular surgery or lymph-vascular disease (23.8% vs 8.4%) compared to patients without SL (p < 0.05). The lymphadenectomy technique adopted during the surgery was also found different in patients diagnosed with SL. At the multivariable analysis (MVA), only the increase of BMI (OR 1.72; CI: 1.47 - 2.81) was found predictor of developing SL.Conclusion: In our experience, the increase of BMI was a significant predictor of SL development in pCa patients submitted to RARP and PLND.

Several experimental studies suggested the role of natural compounds in prostate cancer growth inhibition by Hedgehog signaling modulation. In the current study, we suggested the anticancer and apoptosis inducing effects of Moringa oleifera (M. oleifera) were linked to downregulation of Hedgehog pathway in PC-3 prostate cancer cells. We found that M. oleifera leaves methanolic extract exhibited significant anticancerous potential by inducing ROS-mediated apoptosis and activation of caspase-3 activity in prostate cancer. We also observed a dose-dependent G0/G1 cell cycle arrest as well as significant alteration in mRNA expression of apoptosis related and Hedgehog signaling pathway genes by M. oleifera extract treatment. Altogether, these experimental findings demonstrated that M. oleifera may exert antiproliferative apoptosis inducing effects by Hedgehog signaling pathway downregulation. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Moringa oleifera plant, a rich nutrional source, has extensive range of pharmacological applications including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer activity. To best of our knowledge, this could be the first intensive report which presented the inhibitory potential of M. oleifera leaves extract against PC-3 prostate cancer cells via targeting key molecules of Hedgehog signaling. Decreased mRNA expression of GLI1 transcription factor and SMO protein of Hedgehog signaling pathway may be involved in antiproliferative effects of M. oleifera leaves extract against prostate cancer cells. Our study suggested that M. oleifera supplementation might be beneficial for the development and improvement of targeted therapeutic strategies in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Fahad Khan', 'Pratibha Pandey', 'Varish Ahmad', 'Tarun Kumar Upadhyay']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Food Biochem""","""['Phenolic Extraction of Moringa Oleifera Leaves Induces Caspase-Dependent and Caspase-Independent Apoptosis through the Generation of Reactive Oxygen Species and the Activation of Intrinsic Mitochondrial Pathway in Human Melanoma Cells.', ""Moringa oleifera L. leaf extract induces cell cycle arrest and mitochondrial apoptosis in Dalton's Lymphoma: An in vitro and in vivo study."", 'Jab1 Inhibition by Methanolic Extract of Moringa Oleifera Leaves in Cervical Cancer Cells: A Potent Targeted Therapeutic Approach.', 'Moringa oleifera Lam: Targeting Chemoprevention.', 'Health benefits and phenolic compounds of Moringa oleifera leaves: A comprehensive review.', 'The use of African medicinal plants in cancer management.', 'Bioactive Polymeric Nanoparticles of Moringa oleifera Induced Phyto-Photothermal Sensitization for the Enhanced Therapy of Retinoblastoma.', 'FASN multi-omic characterization reveals metabolic heterogeneity in pancreatic and prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Anticancer Potential of Moringa oleifera on BRCA-1 Gene: Systems Biology.', 'Anti-Cancer and Medicinal Potentials of Moringa Isothiocyanate.']"""

Methods:   We conducted a retrospective analysis of 1125 men treated for LUTS with holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP). Patients were stratified according to a preoperative PSA level higher (high PSA; n = 365) or lower than 10 ng/ml (low PSA; n = 760). Preoperative and histopathological parameters were compared between both cohorts. Logistic regression models were used to identify independent predictors of iPCa.  Results:   Demographic parameters were similar between both cohorts. The median PSA levels were 14.2 ng/ml (11.5-19.9) and 4 ng/ml (2.4-6.0). The prostate volume was significantly higher in the high PSA group (105 cc vs. 75 cc; p < 0.001). Correspondingly, the PSA density was significantly increased in the high PSA cohort compared to the low PSA cohort (0.14 vs. 0.05; p < 0.001). The overall detection rate of iPCa showed no difference between groups (9.5% vs. 9.9%). More preoperative prostate biopsies were performed in the high PSA group compared to the low PSA group (46.8% vs. 17.6%; p < 0.001). However, the rate of false negative results was comparable between groups (12.7% vs. 11.1%; p = 0.726). In logistic regression models all PSA-related parameters failed to predict iPCa.

Increased RBM3 nuclear expression has been linked to improved clinical outcomes.  Aims:   Given that RBM3 has been hypothesized to play a role in critical nuclear functions such as chromatin remodeling, DNA damage response, and other post-transcriptional processes, we sought to: (1) quantify RBM3 protein levels in archival PCa samples; (2) develop a nuclear morphometric model to determine if measures of RBM3 protein levels and nuclear features could be used to predict disease aggressiveness and biochemical recurrence.  Methods & results:   This study utilized two tissue microarrays (TMAs) stained for RBM3 that included 80 total cases of PCa stratified by Gleason score. A software-mediated image processing algorithm identified RBM3-positive cancerous nuclei in the TMA samples and calculated twenty-two features quantifying RBM3 expression and nuclear architecture. Multivariate logistic regression (MLR) modeling was performed to determine if RBM3 levels and nuclear structural changes could predict PCa aggressiveness and biochemical recurrence (BCR). Leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) was used to provide insight on how the predictive capabilities of the feature set might behave with respect to an independent patient cohort to address issues such as model overfitting. RBM3 expression was found to be significantly downregulated in highly aggressive GS ≥ 8 PCa samples compared to other Gleason scores (P < 0.0001) and significantly down-regulated in recurrent PCa samples compared to non-recurrent samples (P = 0.0377). An eleven-feature nuclear morphometric MLR model accurately identified aggressive PCa, yielding a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.90 (P < 0.0001) in the raw data set and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.83-0.97) for LOOCV testing. The same eleven-feature model was then used to predict recurrence, yielding a ROC-AUC of 0.92 (P = 0.0004) in the raw data set and 0.76 (95% CI: 0.64-0.87) for LOOCV testing.  Conclusions:   The RBM3 biomarker alone is a strong prognostic marker for the prediction of aggressive PCa and biochemical recurrence.

Methods:   PCSCs derived from the PC-3 cell line were examined for Notch-1 expression.

The combination of GSI with DOX promoted DOX-induced cell growth inhibition, apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and sphere formation in PCSCs. In nude mice bearing PC-3 PCSC-derived tumors, the combination of GSI and DOX reduced the tumor growth, which was associated with the decreased Notch-1 expression in tumor tissues.

However, their improvement on progression-free survival (PFS) remains modest, potentially explained by tumor molecular heterogeneity. Several prognostic molecular biomarkers have been identified for mCRPC that may have predictive potential to guide treatment selection and prolong PFS. We designed a platform trial to test this hypothesis.  Methods:   The Prostate-Biomarker (ProBio) study is a multi-center, outcome-adaptive, multi-arm, biomarker-driven platform trial for tailoring treatment decisions for men with mCRPC. Treatment decisions in the experimental arms are based on biomarker signatures defined as mutations in certain genes/pathways suggested in the scientific literature to be important for treatment response in mCRPC. The biomarker signatures are determined by targeted sequencing of circulating tumor and germline DNA using a panel specifically designed for mCRPC.  Discussion:   Patients are stratified based on the sequencing results and randomized to either current clinical practice (control), where the treating physician decides treatment, or to molecularly driven treatment selection based on the biomarker profile. Outcome-adaptive randomization is implemented to early identify promising treatments for a biomarker signature. Biomarker signature-treatment combinations graduate from the platform when they demonstrate 85% probability of improving PFS compared to the control arm. Graduated combinations are further evaluated in a seamless confirmatory trial with fixed randomization. The platform design allows for new drugs and biomarkers to be introduced in the study.  Conclusions:   The ProBio design allows promising treatment-biomarker combinations to quickly graduate from the platform and be confirmed for rapid implementation in clinical care.

However, the relative survival concept of 'survival as far as the cancer is concerned' can be biased due to differing non-cancer risk of death in the population with cancer (competing risks). Furthermore, while relative survival can be stratified or standardised, for example by sex or age, adjustment for a broad range of sociodemographic variables potentially influencing survival is not possible. In this paper we propose Fine and Gray competing risks multivariable regression as a method that can assess the probability of death from cancer, incorporating competing risks and adjusting for sociodemographic confounders.  Methods:   We used whole of population, person-level routinely linked Western Australian cancer registry and mortality data for individuals diagnosed from 1983 to 2011 for major cancer types combined, female breast, colorectal, prostate, lung and pancreatic cancers, and grade IV glioma. The probability of death from the index cancer (cancer death) was evaluated using Fine and Gray competing risks regression, adjusting for age, sex, Indigenous status, socio-economic status, accessibility to services, time sub-period and (for all cancers combined) cancer type.  Results:   When comparing diagnoses in 2008-2011 to 1983-1987, we observed substantial decreases in the rate of cancer death for major cancer types combined (N = 192,641, - 31%), female breast (- 37%), prostate (- 76%) and colorectal cancers (- 37%). In contrast, improvements in pancreatic (- 15%) and lung cancers (- 9%), and grade IV glioma (- 24%) were less and the cumulative probability of cancer death for these cancer types remained high.  Conclusion:   Considering the justifiable expectation for confounder adjustment in observational epidemiological studies, standard methods for tracking population-level changes in cancer survival are simplistic. This study demonstrates how competing risks and sociodemographic covariates can be incorporated using readily available software.

We sought to evaluate the relationship between DCX expression and these variables in human prostate cancer.  Methods and materials:   DCX expression was measured in transcriptome-wide microarray data from 18,501 patients with localized prostate cancer and 290 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and compared across disease states, histologic grades, and clinical outcomes. Biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS), and overall survival (OS) were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards.  Results:   DCX expression was not significantly different among normal prostate (n = 29), primary prostate cancer (n = 131), and metastases (n = 19) and did not increase with grade in a large cohort of radical prostatectomy samples (n = 17,967). Those with DCX expression above and below the median did not have significant differences in BRFS (HR 1.15 [95% confidence interval, 0.88-1.49], P = .31), MFS (HR 1.2 [0.84-1.7], P = .3), or OS (HR 1.15 [0.7-1.84], P = .56). In a cohort with untreated prostate cancer, DCX expression was higher in neuroendocrine tumors (n = 10) compared with grade group 5 prostate adenocarcinoma (n = 110) (P = .007). Similarly, in 2 cohorts with mCRPC (n = 290), DCX expression was higher in lesions with neuroendocrine features compared with adenocarcinoma (P < .001).  Conclusions:   Contrary to recent data using mouse models, DCX expression did not differ by disease state or outcome and did not increase with grade in a large data set of patients with prostate adenocarcinoma. However, DCX expression appeared to correlate with neuroendocrine histology, a subgroup that can arise de novo or in the castrate-resistant setting.

Methods: Fifty-three gay men with PCa responded to an online survey regarding the applicability of the sexual function domain in the validated EPIC questionnaire.

Results: A majority of gay men with PCa found the EPIC sexual function tool to be applicable when measuring erectile function (76.5%). Of the men queried, 64.2% felt that the prostate is a source of sexual pleasure and 52.8% felt it important to measure sexual satisfaction associated with receptive anal intercourse. A larger proportion of gay men who engaged in receptive anal intercourse, compared with those who did not engage in receptive anal intercourse, felt that the prostate is a source of sexual pleasure (100% vs. 57.1%), and thought it important to measure sexual satisfaction as it relates to receptive anal intercourse after PCa treatment (90.0% vs. 45.2%).

Doxorubicin is the first-line clinical treatment for castration-resistant PCa. Clinically, relapse is almost inevitable due to the cancer cells' increasing resistance to doxorubicin. Our previous studies have revealed that retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptor γ (RORγ) is a key protein for cancer progression and a promising target for PCa therapy. Though, RORγ's role and mechanism in doxorubicin-resistant PCa remain unclear. To study the mechanism of doxorubicin resistance, we generated a doxorubicin-resistant PCa cell line C4-2B (C4-2B DoxR) in this study, by culturing cells in an increasing doxorubicin concentration. Here, we show that RORγ expression was upregulated in C4-2B DoxR cells compared with that in normal C4-2B cells. The RORγ-stably-overexpressing PCa cell line constructed by lentiviral transfection showed an obvious improvement in doxorubicin resistance and a trend toward castration resistance. Furthermore, RORγ-specific small molecule inhibitors XY018, GSK805, and SR2211 can significantly inhibit the proliferation of C4-2B DoxR cells and promote their apoptosis. Collectively, these results have demonstrated the correlation between the upregulation of RORγ and the development of PCa's doxorubicin resistance, thus providing new ideas for solving the problem of chemotherapy drug resistance in PCa.""","""['Menghan Gao', 'Lang Guo', 'Hong Wang', 'Jialuo Huang', 'Fanghai Han', 'Songtao Xiang', 'Junjian Wang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cell Biol Int""","""['RELA is sufficient to mediate interleukin-1 repression of androgen receptor expression and activity in an LNCaP disease progression model.', 'Targeting CPT1B as a potential therapeutic strategy in castration-resistant and enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Therapeutic Targeting of MDR1 Expression by RORγ Antagonists Resensitizes Cross-Resistant CRPC to Taxane via Coordinated Induction of Cell Death Programs.', 'Molecular model for neuroendocrine prostate cancer progression.', 'The ROR nuclear orphan receptor subfamily: critical regulators of multiple biological processes.', 'Molecular Landscape of LncRNAs in Prostate Cancer: A focus on pathways and therapeutic targets for intervention.', 'From Therapy Resistance to Targeted Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'Circadian rhythms and cancers: the intrinsic links and therapeutic potentials.', 'Molecular regulations of circadian rhythm and implications for physiology and diseases.', 'Role of noncoding RNA in drug resistance of prostate cancer.']"""

Patients who developed PeNR after definitive EBRT and were subsequently treated with sPRT at our institution between November 2007 and December 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. The prescribed dose was 45-50.4 Gy (1.8-2 Gy per fraction) to the upper pelvis, with up to 54-66 Gy (1.8-2 Gy per fraction) for recurrent nodes. Long-term hormonal therapy was used as neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy. The study population consisted of 12 consecutive patients with PeNR after definitive EBRT (median age: 73 years). The median follow-up period was 58.9 months.

Methods:   The considered radiobiological model is based on the assumption of two populations (compartments) of cells: oxygenated (aerobic) cells and hypoxic cells. After each fraction of radiation, some of the hypoxic cells reoxygenate while a fraction of initially aerobic cells becomes hypoxic. The kinetics of this process between successive treatments is described by coupled, first-order differential equations. To determine the effect of reoxygenation on cell kill in the treatment target, we utilize the linear-quadratic (LQ) model assuming different radiosensitivities for the aerobic and hypoxic cells.  Results:   Analytical solutions for the number of surviving malignant cells are obtained for special cases of slow and fast reoxygenation. The radiobiological effect of reoxygenation for different fractionation regimens is also evaluated numerically.  Conclusions:   In this study, a radiobiological model for kinetics of reoxygenation in tumors is used to evaluate different fractionation schedules in radiotherapy of prostate cancer. The obtained results indicate that in the case of low alpha/beta ratio for malignant cells (e.g., α / β = 1.5 Gy), treatment schedule with 4-10 fractions and dose per fraction >4-5 Gy can result in increased cell kill in the treatment target at the same level of rectal toxicity as compared to conventional fractionation. The findings of this study also suggest that radiotherapy of the prostate with 1-3 fractions can be radiobiologically inferior to treatments with greater number of fractions.""","""['V Y Kuperman', 'L M Lubich']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['The minimal FLASH sparing effect needed to compensate the increase of radiobiological damage due to hypofractionation for late-reacting tissues.', 'A radiobiological model of reoxygenation and fractionation effects.', 'Variability of α/β ratios for prostate cancer with the fractionation schedule: caution against using the linear-quadratic model for hypofractionated radiotherapy.', 'Radiobiology of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy: what are the optimal fractionation schedules?', 'The radiobiology of prostate cancer including new aspects of fractionated radiotherapy.', 'Radiobiological Meta-Analysis of the Response of Prostate Cancer to Different Fractionations: Evaluation of the Linear-Quadratic Response at Large Doses and the Effect of Risk and ADT.', 'Cerebral tissue oxygenation response to brain irradiation measured during clinical radiotherapy.', 'The evolution of rectal cancer treatment: the journey to total neoadjuvant therapy and organ preservation.', 'Technical Note: Break-even dose level for hypofractionated treatment schedules.', 'Classification of tolerable/intolerable mucosal toxicity of head-and-neck radiotherapy schedules with a biomathematical model of cell dynamics.']"""

Methods:   A two-step task-based residual network (T2 RN) is proposed to automatically identify inherent landmarks in prostate PTV. The input to the T2 RN is the pretreatment CBCT images of the patient, and the output is the deep learning-identified landmarks in the PTV. To ensure robust PTV localization, the T2 RN model is trained by using over thousand sets of CT images with labeled landmarks, each of the CTs corresponds to a different scenario of patient position and/or anatomy distribution generated by synthetically changing the planning CT (pCT) image. The changes, including translation, rotation, and deformation, represent vast possible clinical situations of anatomy variations during a course of radiation therapy (RT). The trained patient-specific T2 RN model is tested by using 240 CBCTs from six patients. The testing CBCTs consists of 120 original CBCTs and 120 synthetic CBCTs. The synthetic CBCTs are generated by applying rotation/translation transformations to each of the original CBCT.  Results:   The systematic/random setup errors between the model prediction and the reference are found to be <0.25/2.46 mm and 0.14/1.41° in translation and rotation dimensions, respectively. Pearson's correlation coefficient between model prediction and the reference is higher than 0.94 in translation and rotation dimensions. The Bland-Altman plots show good agreement between the two techniques.  Conclusions:   A novel T2 RN deep learning technique is established to localize the prostate PTV for RT patient setup. Our results show that highly accurate marker-less prostate setup is achievable by leveraging the state-of-the-art deep learning strategy.""","""['Xiaokun Liang', 'Wei Zhao', 'Dimitre H Hristov', 'Mark K Buyyounouski', 'Steven L Hancock', 'Hilary Bagshaw', 'Qin Zhang', 'Yaoqin Xie', 'Lei Xing']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['The potential failure risk of the cone-beam computed tomography-based planning target volume margin definition for prostate image-guided radiotherapy based on a prospective single-institutional hybrid analysis.', 'Feasibility of MRI-based reference images for image-guided radiotherapy of the pelvis with either cone-beam computed tomography or planar localization images.', 'A feature alignment score for online cone-beam CT-based image-guided radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Deep Learning in Radiation Oncology Treatment Planning for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Uncertainty Assessment for Deep Learning Radiotherapy Applications.', 'Incorporating the synthetic CT image for improving the performance of deformable image registration between planning CT and cone-beam CT.', '2D/3D Non-Rigid Image Registration via Two Orthogonal X-ray Projection Images for Lung Tumor Tracking.', 'Human-level comparable control volume mapping with a deep unsupervised-learning model for image-guided radiation therapy.', 'Artificial intelligence in image-guided radiotherapy: a review of treatment target localization.', 'Geometric and Dosimetric Evaluation of Deep Learning-Based Automatic Delineation on CBCT-Synthesized CT and Planning CT for Breast Cancer Adaptive Radiotherapy: A Multi-Institutional Study.']"""

Methods:   A questionnaire with 12 items was administered to the 775 Italian radiation oncologist members of the AIRO.  Results:   One hundred of the members completed the survey. The survey highlighted that 59% of the participants are currently performing prostate re-EBRT, while nearly two-thirds (65%) affirmed that they are taking into consideration the procedure in case of intraprostatic relapse. Regarding the clinical target volume (CTV), only a minority (16%) declared to always prefer the partial prostate re-irradiation, while a consistent portion (nearly two-thirds) relied on clinical considerations of the choice towards partial or whole gland irradiation. The main techniques used for re-irradiation resulted to be intensity-modulated RT (IMRT)/volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and SBRT, having received approximately 40% of responses each. Regarding the criteria for patients' selection, more than 75% of responders agreed on the use of positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT)-choline to exclude distant metastases and of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mp-MRI) to detect intraprostatic recurrence. A sufficient timeframe (> 3 years) between primary RT and reirradiation was indicated by more than half of participants as an important driver in decision-making, while histological confirmation of the relapse was considered not essential by more than two-thirds. For the use of concomitant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), most AIRO members (79%) agreed that the prescription should be based on a case-by-case analysis. Extreme hypofractionation (> 5 Gy/fraction) was preferred by the majority (52%) of the AIRO members. In most centers (more than 74%), the planning dose-volume constraints were generally extrapolated from the published data. In half of the cases, the interviewed responders affirmed that no major gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicities were registered in the follow-up of their re-EBRT patients. Bladder complications represented the most commonly observed form of toxicity, with an incidence of 67%.  Conclusion:   This first AIRO survey about salvage prostate re-EBRT provides an interesting snapshot and suggests increasing interest in re-EBRT patients in Italy.

The molecular mechanism of PCa pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated. In the present study, the expression profile of E2F transcription factor 7 (E2F7) in PCa was examined using immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR, whilst cell cycle progression and apoptosis were determined using fluorescent cell activated sorting techniques. Cell viability was measured using Cell Counting Kit‑8 in loss‑ and gain‑of‑function studies. Dual‑luciferase reporter assay was used to verify if E2F7 was one of the potential targets of miR‑30c. The staining score of E2F7 of PCa tissues was found to be notably higher compared with that of adjacent normal tissues. Suppression of E2F7 expression in PCa cell lines led to significantly reduced proliferation rates, increased proportion of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and higher apoptotic rates compared with those in negative control groups. Dual‑luciferase reporter assay revealed E2F7 to be one of the binding targets of microRNA (miR)‑30c. In addition, transfection of miR‑30c mimics into PCa cells resulted in reduced cell viability, increased proportion of cells in the G1 phase and higher apoptotic rates. By contrast, transfection with the miR‑30c inhibitor led to lower apoptosis rates of PCa cells compared with negative control groups, whilst E2F7 siRNA co‑transfection reversed stimulatory effects of miR‑30c inhibitors on cell viability. In addition, the expression of cyclin‑dependent kinase inhibitor p21 were found to be upregulated by transfection with either E2F7 siRNA or miR‑30c mimics into PCa cells. In conclusion, the present study suggested that E2F7 may be positively associated with PCa cell proliferation by inhibiting p21, whereas E2F7 is in turn under regulation by miR‑30c. These observations suggest the miR‑30c/E2F7/p21 axis to be a viable therapeutic target for PCa.""","""['Ying Wang#', 'Xiaojuan Pei#', 'Po Xu#', 'Zhibo Tan', 'Zhenwei Zhu', 'Guangping Zhang', 'Zeying Jiang', 'Zhe Deng']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['miR‑30c suppresses prostate cancer survival by targeting the ASF/SF2 splicing factor oncoprotein.', 'A miR-26a/E2F7 feedback loop contributes to tamoxifen resistance in ER-positive breast cancer.', 'Long non-coding RNA DLEU2 promotes the progression of esophageal cancer through miR-30e-5p/E2F7 axis.', 'Circ-CCS is identified as a cancer-promoting circRNA in lung cancer partly by regulating the miR-383/E2F7 axis.', 'LncRNA MYLK-AS1 facilitates tumor progression and angiogenesis by targeting miR-424-5p/E2F7 axis and activating VEGFR-2 signaling pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Transcriptome-Wide Association Analysis Identifies Novel Candidate Susceptibility Genes for Prostate-Specific Antigen Levels in Men Without Prostate Cancer.', 'VIRMA promotes nasopharyngeal carcinoma, tumorigenesis, and metastasis by upregulation of E2F7 in an m6A-dependent manner.', 'Cell cycle associated miRNAs as target and therapeutics in lung cancer treatment.', 'The role of microRNA-30c in targeting interleukin 6, as an inflammatory cytokine, in the mesenchymal stem cell: a therapeutic approach in colorectal cancer.', 'ERα and ERβ Homodimers in the Same Cellular Context Regulate Distinct Transcriptomes and Functions.']"""

With the current capture of HIV status of cancer patients in our cancer registry at Jos Nigeria, this study aims to assess the effect of HIV on cancer mortality outcomes. Methodology: We conducted a 2-year retrospective cohort study of cancer registry data from Jos, north central Nigeria. The cancers were grouped into cervical, breast, liver, hematologic, colonic, AIDS defining, prostate and others in this study. Patients were followed up to determine their patient time contribution from time at initiation of cancer treatment to death or the end of study period. Those lost to follow-up were censored at date of their last known follow-up in clinic. Results: Out of 930 cancer cases evaluated, 52 (5.6%) were HIV positive, 507 (54.5%) were HIV negative and 371 (39.9%) did not know their HIV status. After 525,223 person- days of follow-up, there were 232 deaths leading to a crude mortality rate of 4.3 per 10,000 person-days. Median survival probability for both HIV-infected and HIV uninfected patients were equal (1,013 days). Unadjusted hazard of death was associated with greater age, HR 0.99 (95% CI: 0.98,0.99, p = 0.002); hepatitis virus, HR 2.40 (95% CI: 1.69,3.43, p = 0.001); liver cancer, HR 2.25 (95% CI:1.11,4.55, p = 0.024); prostate cancer, HR 0.17 (95% CI: 0.06,0.393, p = 0.001). In an adjusted model, only prostate cancer AHR 0.23 (95% CI: 0.12, 0.42, p < 0.001) and liver cancer AHR 2.45 (95% CI: 1.78, 5.51, p < 0.001) remained significantly associated with death regardless of HIV status.

It is activated through a fusion with the androgen-responsive TMPRSS2 promoter in 50% of cases. There is therefore significant interest in developing novel therapeutic agents that target ERG. We have taken an antisense approach and designed morpholino-based oligonucleotides that target ERG by inducing skipping of its constitutive exon 4.  Methods:   We designed antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (splice-switching oligonucleotides, SSOs) that target both the 5' and 3' splice sites of ERG's exon 4. We tested their efficacy in terms of inducing exon 4 skipping in two ERG-positive cell lines, VCaP prostate cancer cells and MG63 osteosarcoma cells. We measured their effect on cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis. We also tested their effect on xenograft tumour growth in mice and on ERG protein expression in a human prostate cancer radical prostatectomy sample ex vivo.  Results:   In VCaP cells, both SSOs were effective at inducing exon 4 skipping, which resulted in a reduction of overall ERG protein levels up to 96 h following a single transfection. SSO-induced ERG reduction decreased cell proliferation, cell migration and significantly increased apoptosis. We observed a concomitant reduction in protein levels for cyclin D1, c-Myc and the Wnt signalling pathway member β-catenin as well as a marker of activated Wnt signalling, p-LRP6. We tested the 3' splice site SSO in MG63 xenografts in mice and observed a reduction in tumour growth. We also demonstrated that the 3' splice site SSO caused a reduction in ERG expression in a patient-derived prostate tumour tissue cultured ex vivo.  Conclusions:   We have successfully designed and tested morpholino-based SSOs that cause a marked reduction in ERG expression, resulting in decreased cell proliferation, a reduced migratory phenotype and increased apoptosis. Our initial tests on mouse xenografts and a human prostate cancer radical prostatectomy specimen indicate that SSOs can be effective for oncogene targeting in vivo.

Here, we assess the potential impact of PHS-informed screening.  Methods:   United Kingdom population incidence data (Cancer Research United Kingdom) and data from the Cluster Randomized Trial of PSA Testing for Prostate Cancer were combined to estimate age-specific clinically significant prostate cancer incidence (Gleason score ≥7, stage T3-T4, PSA ≥10, or nodal/distant metastases). Using HRs estimated from the ProtecT prostate cancer trial, age-specific incidence rates were calculated for various PHS risk percentiles. Risk-equivalent age, when someone with a given PHS percentile has prostate cancer risk equivalent to an average 50-year-old man (50-year-standard risk), was derived from PHS and incidence data. Positive predictive value (PPV) of PSA testing for clinically significant prostate cancer was calculated using PHS-adjusted age groups.  Results:   The expected age at diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer differs by 19 years between the 1st and 99th PHS percentiles: men with PHS in the 1st and 99th percentiles reach the 50-year-standard risk level at ages 60 and 41, respectively. PPV of PSA was higher for men with higher PHS-adjusted age.  Conclusions:   PHS provides individualized estimates of risk-equivalent age for clinically significant prostate cancer.

High-dose radiation has been demonstrated to stimulate the immune system in various human solid tumors. We hypothesized that localized radiation therapy, in the form of high dose-rate brachytherapy (HDRBT), would overcome immune suppression in PCa.  Methods:   To investigate whether HDRBT altered prostate immune context, we analyzed preradiation versus postradiation human tissue from a cohort of 24 patients with localized PCa that received HDRBT as primary treatment (RadBank cohort). We performed Nanostring immune gene expression profiling, digital spatial profiling, and high-throughput immune cell multiplex immunohistochemistry analysis. We also resolved tumor and nontumor zones in spatial and bioinformatic analyses to explore the immunological response.  Results:   Nanostring immune profiling revealed numerous immune checkpoint molecules (eg, B7-H3, CTLA4, PDL1, and PDL2) and TGFβ levels were increased in response to HDRBT. We used a published 16-gene tumor inflammation signature (TIS) to divide tumors into distinct immune activation states (high:hot, intermediate and low:cold) and showed that most localized PCa are cold tumors pre-HDRBT. Crucially, HDRBT converted 80% of these 'cold'-phenotype tumors into an 'intermediate' or 'hot' class. We used digital spatial profiling to show these HDRBT-induced changes in prostate TIS scores were derived from the nontumor regions. Furthermore, these changes in TIS were also associated with pervasive changes in immune cell density and spatial relationships-in particular, between T cell subsets and antigen presenting cells. We identified an increased density of CD4+ FOXP3+ T cells, CD68+ macrophages and CD68+ CD11c+ dendritic cells in response to HDRBT. The only subset change specific to tumor zones was PDL1- macrophages. While these immune responses were heterogeneous, HDRBT induced significant changes in immune cell associations, including a gained T cell and HMWCK+ PDL1+ interaction in tumor zones.  Conclusion:   In conclusion, we showed HDRBT converted ""cold"" prostate tumors into more immunologically activated ""hot"" tissues, with accompanying spatially organized immune infiltrates and signaling changes. Understanding and potentially harnessing these changes will have widespread implications for the future treatment of localized PCa, including rational use of combination radio-immunotherapy.""","""['Simon P Keam', 'Heloise Halse', 'Thu Nguyen', 'Minyu Wang', 'Nicolas Van Kooten Losio', 'Catherine Mitchell', 'Franco Caramia', 'David J Byrne', 'Sue Haupt', 'Georgina Ryland', 'Phillip K Darcy', 'Shahneen Sandhu', 'Piers Blombery', 'Ygal Haupt', 'Scott G Williams', 'Paul J Neeson']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Immunother Cancer""","""['PTEN-deficient prostate cancer is associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment mediated by increased expression of IDO1 and infiltrating FoxP3+ T regulatory cells.', 'Immune cell analyses of the tumor microenvironment in prostate cancer highlight infiltrating regulatory T cells and macrophages as adverse prognostic factors.', 'A ""scoping"" review of prostate brachytherapy and immune responses.', 'Systemic Inflammation Associates With a Myeloid Inflamed Tumor Microenvironment in Primary Resected Colon Cancer-May Cold Tumors Simply Be Too Hot?', 'GEC/ESTRO recommendations on high dose rate afterloading brachytherapy for localised prostate cancer: an update.', 'Novel radionuclide therapy combinations in prostate cancer.', 'Sample size calculation for a NanoString GeoMx spatial transcriptomics experiment to study predictors of fibrosis progression in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.', 'Targeted Radiation and Immune Therapies-Advances and Opportunities for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Does brachytherapy boost improve survival outcomes in Gleason Grade Group 5 patients treated with external beam radiotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy?

To test this hypothesis, we investigated the association of aspirin and statin use with the presence and extent of intraprostatic inflammation, and the abundance of specific immune cell types, in benign prostate tissue from a subset of men from the placebo arm of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial. Men were classified as aspirin or statin users if they reported use at baseline or during the 7-year trial. Presence and extent of inflammation were assessed, and markers of specific immune cell types (CD4, CD8, FoxP3, CD68, and c-KIT) were scored, in slides from end-of-study prostate biopsies taken irrespective of clinical indication, per trial protocol. Logistic regression was used to estimate associations between medication use and inflammation measures, adjusted for potential confounders. Of 357 men included, 61% reported aspirin use and 32% reported statin use. Prevalence and extent of inflammation were not associated with medication use. However, aspirin users were more likely to have low FoxP3, a T regulatory cell marker [OR, 5.60; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.16-27.07], and statin users were more likely to have low CD68, a macrophage marker (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 0.81-3.27).

Materials and methods:   From January 2008 to December 2017, all men in the Northern region of New Zealand who had a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test performed in the community were identified from the electronic laboratory reports database. Asymptomatic men, with no known diagnosis of PCa, were included. Variables collected were age, ethnicity, social deprivation, medical therapy, PSA test information and cancer data. Disparities were investigated by comparing the frequency of PSA testing, proportions of men screened, and rates of cancer detection, between Māori (indigenous) and non-Māori ethnic groups.  Results:   The study cohort included 248 491 men, who each received approximately 3.45 PSA tests over the 10-year study period. Māori men were less likely to be tested compared to non-Māori men (25.4% vs 46.1% of the total aged-matched region population; P < 0.001). Moreover, they received less frequent PSA testing irrespective of their deprivation status (mean difference of 0.97 PSA tests per person; P < 0.001). The higher testing frequency in non-Māori men was associated with increased PCa diagnosis rates. Nevertheless, cancers detected in Māori men were 73% more likely to be of high grade (Gleason 8 or above), compared to those in non-Māori men.  Conclusion:   There were significant ethnic disparities in PCa screening rates in the Northern region of New Zealand. Māori men, regardless of other demographic factors, were disproportionately affected.

After five weeks, toxicity and gene expression were analyzed in testicular samples by ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) using RNA sequence data and quantitative reverse transcriptase (qRT)-PCR; hormonal damage was analyzed in blood samples. NCL1 treated GC-1, TM3, and TM4 cell lines were analyzed by cell viability, chromatin immunoprecipitation, flow cytometry, and Western blot assays.  Results:   LSD1 was mainly expressed in human Sertoli and germ cells, with LSD1 levels significantly decreased in a progressive meiosis-dependent manner; germ cells showed similar expression patterns in normal spermatogenesis and early/late maturation arrest. Histological examination revealed significantly increased levels of abnormal seminiferous tubules in 3.0 mg/kg NCL1-treated mice compared to control, with increased cellular detachment, sloughing, vacuolization, eosinophilic changes, and TUNEL-positive cells. IPA and qRT-PCR revealed NCL1 treatment down-regulated LSD1 activity. NCL1 also reduced total serum testosterone levels. Western blots of mouse testicular samples revealed NCL1 induced a marked elevation in cleaved caspases 3, 7, and 8, and connexin 43 proteins. NCL1 treatment significantly reduced GC-1, but not TM3 and TM4, cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. In flow cytometry analysis, NCL1 induced apoptosis in GC-1 cells.

The indication for HIFU was morphologically-proven PCa (stage T2a-cN0M0) in patients with contraindications due to comorbidities or those who refused from radical prostatectomy.  Results:   A decrease in PSA to 0.5 ng/ml or less was observed in 74% of patients. A stable PSA level for 3 years was observed in 76% of patients. PSA levels differed depending on the PCa risk group. In the low-risk PCa, negative biopsy was seen in 89.6% of cases, in comparison with 72.2% and 69.4% in intermediate and high-risk PCa, respectively. There was a significant decrease in the volume of the prostate in all patients with low-risk PCa. The largest decrease in prostate volume was observed 12 months after HIFU. Regarding recurrence-free survival after HIFU therapy, during follow-up of 3 years or more, 77% of patients didnt have any signs of recurrence. A 3-year overall survival after HIFU was 83%. In addition, an increase in postoperative PSA levels, change in parameters of Doppler study and laser Doppler flowmetry at the area of the prostate during the period of 6-36 months after HIFU was associated with a significant increase in the risk of recurrence of PCa at biopsy.  Conclusion:   HIFU therapy is an effective treatment method for inducing prostate necrosis with minimal collateral damage to the surrounding tissue. The best results were achieved in patients with low-risk PCa. There were minimal adverse events after HIFU.

Herein, we performed a comprehensive assessment using pooled analysis, FPRP (false-positive report probability), TSA (trial sequential analysis), and eQTL (expression quantitative trait loci) analysis. Eighteen high-quality articles from China were enrolled. The pooled analysis of rs2295080 with 9502 cases and 10,965 controls showed a decreased risk of urinary system tumors and specific prostate cancers [TG vs. TT, TG+GG vs. TT and G vs. T; P<0.05, OR (odds ratio) <1]. FPRP and TSA data further confirmed these results. There was an increased risk of leukemia [G vs. T, GG vs. TT, and GG vs. TT+TG genotypes; P<0.05, OR>1]. The eQTL data showed a potential correlation between the rs2295080 and mTOR expression in whole blood samples. Nevertheless, FPRP and TSA data suggested that more evidence is required to confirm the potential role of rs2295080 in leukemia risk. The pooled analysis of rs2536 (6653 cases and 7025 controls) showed a significant association in the subgroup of ""population-based"" control source via the allele, heterozygote, dominant, and carrier comparisons (P<0.05, OR>1). In conclusion, the TG genotype of mTOR rs2295080 may be linked to reduced susceptibility to urinary system tumors or specific prostate cancers in Chinese patients. The currently data do not strongly support a role of rs2295080 in leukemia susceptibility. Large sample sizes are needed to confirm the potential role of rs2536 in more types of cancer.""","""['Guang-Hui Qi#', 'Chun-Hui Wang#', 'Hong-Ge Zhang', 'Jian-Guo Yu', 'Fei Ding', 'Zhi-Chao Song', 'Qing-Hua Xia']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Biosci Rep""","""['Associations of Genetic Polymorphisms of mTOR rs2295080 T/G and rs1883965 G/A with Susceptibility of Urinary System Cancers.', 'Impacts of the mTOR gene polymorphisms rs2536 and rs2295080 on breast cancer risk in the Chinese population.', 'Associations of genetic polymorphisms in pTEN/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway genes with cancer risk: A meta-analysis in Asian population.', 'Genetic polymorphisms of mTOR and cancer risk: a systematic review and updated meta-analysis.', 'Relationship between apurinic endonuclease 1 Asp148Glu polymorphism and gastrointestinal cancer risk: An updated meta-analysis.', 'Associations of Genetic Polymorphisms of mTOR rs2295080 T/G and rs1883965 G/A with Susceptibility of Urinary System Cancers.', 'Polymorphisms in the mTOR-PI3K-Akt pathway, energy balance-related exposures and colorectal cancer risk in the Netherlands Cohort Study.', 'Impact of mTOR gene polymorphisms and gene-tea interaction on susceptibility to tuberculosis.']"""

This study investigated the association between mental distress and the subjective need for psychosocial support comparing subgroups of patients with different treatments and disease stages.  Method:   We performed an observational, cross-sectional study including patients with four medical conditions: Active Surveillance, radical prostatectomy, biochemical relapse, metastasized disease. Mental distress (NCCN Distress-Thermometer), symptoms of depression and anxiety (PHQ-9, GAD-7), psychosocial needs and coping resources (self-designed questionnaire) were assessed.  Results: N = 130 patients were included. 33.3% showed distress, 16.5% symptoms of moderate depression and 13% symptoms of moderate anxiety. We found no significant differences between the four groups. An association was present between distress and wish for psychosocial support (χ2 = 4.3; p < 0.05; ϕ = 0.19). Almost 90% lived with a partner, which represents a resource.  Conclusions:   Prostate cancer patients showed low levels of mental distress, depression and anxiety with no difference in terms of disease stage and treatment modality. Therefore, careful psychosocial screening of all patients is essential to identify those in need for support. Distressed patients express a need for psychosocial support more often.

Patients and Methods: Data on 120 patients who underwent single-port extraperitoneal RRP were collected and categorized into two groups: Group I (n = 98) included patients who received outpatient care (i.e. discharged on postoperative day 0) and Group II (n = 22) comprised patients with inpatient care. Demographics and perioperative data were recorded and analyzed between the two groups. Multivariable binary logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with inpatient care. Results: Most patients (98/120: 81.7%) were discharged in few hours (median: 4.1 hours) after surgery (outpatient care: Group I [n = 98]), whereas others (Group II [n = 22]) received inpatient care (median hospital stay: 25.4 hours); p < 0.00001. Most patients with inpatient care (13/22, 59.1%) were among the first initial 40 cases, whereas 37 out of last 40 patients received outpatient care (p = 0.005). Operative time was significantly shorter in patients with outpatient prostatectomy (p = 0.015). The amount of narcotics per patient (if administered) was also significantly greater in Group II (p = 0.006). With regression analysis, having medical comorbidities (odds ratio [OR]: 3.41 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.05-5.64; p = 0.014), a longer operative time (OR: 1.15 95% CI: 1.10-1.28, p = 0.017), as well as a higher dose of administered narcotics after operation (OR: 1.31 95% CI: 1.08-1.61, p = 0.005) were significant predictors of inpatient care after single-port extraperitoneal RRP. Conclusion: A safe transition to outpatient care is feasible in patients undergoing single-port extraperitoneal RRP. In addition to associated medical comorbidities, a longer operative time and the amount of received narcotic after procedure were the most significant predictors of prolong hospital stay after single-port extraperitoneal RRP. These later modifiable predictors can be optimized with improvement of surgical techniques, intraoperative and postoperative pain management protocols through quality improvement initiatives.""","""['Alireza Aminsharifi', 'Clark A Wilson', 'Guilherme Sawczyn', 'Soodong Kim', 'Louis Lenfant', 'Jihad Kaouk']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Extraperitoneal versus Transperitoneal Single Port Robotic Radical Prostatectomy: A Comparative Analysis of Perioperative Outcomes.', 'Outpatient Robotic Radical Prostatectomy: Matched-Pair Comparison with Inpatient Surgery.', 'Safety and feasibility of outpatient robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Perioperative Outcomes Between Single-Port and ""Multi-Port"" Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Where do we stand?', 'Robotic vs. Retropubic radical prostatectomy in prostate cancer: A systematic review and an meta-analysis update.', 'First Canadian experience with same-day discharge after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.']"""

The CUSUM method comprises sequential monitoring of cumulative differences from a target level in performance quality over time, allowing the detection of deviations from the target. We use the CUSUM method in this study to derive both institutional and surgeon-specific learning curves for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Patients and Methods: We reviewed 540 patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer (pathologic stage T2) who underwent RARP at our institution between September 2011 and December 2017. The CUSUM method was used to construct both institutional and individual-surgeon learning curves; the outcome was assessed based on whether a positive surgical margin (PSM) was present. The target PSM rate was 20%. Of seven surgeons performing robot-assisted resections for this period, four who performed ≥60 resections were assessed separately. Results: Of 540 patients, 74 (14%) had PSMs. The institutional CUSUM chart exhibited a downward trend for the first 54 cases and an upward trend thereafter. The CUSUM chart for the earliest adopter was similar to that for the institution; that is, learning was complete at 45 cases. Two adopters did not undergo a learning curve as they consistently performed well. The last adopter required 10 cases for initial learning. However, his CUSUM chart trend became negative at 46 cases and remained so afterward. Conclusions: CUSUM charts are useful for monitoring surgical quality. Long-term monitoring of the PSM rate of a surgeon who has become independent allows an attending surgeon to intervene if necessary; thus, long-term quality control is assured.""","""['Kazuhiro Ohwaki', 'Fumiyasu Endo', 'Masaki Shimbo', 'Kazunori Hattori']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Learning curve of minimally invasive radical prostatectomy: Comprehensive evaluation and cumulative summation analysis of oncological outcomes.', 'Superior quality of life and improved surgical margins are achievable with robotic radical prostatectomy after a long learning curve: a prospective single-surgeon study of 1552 consecutive cases.', 'A multi-surgeon learning curve analysis of overall and site-specific positive surgical margins after RARP and implications for training.', 'Methods for training of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in prostate cancer.', 'The learning curves of major laparoscopic and robotic procedures in urology: a systematic review.', 'Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: learning curves and outcomes from an Australian perspective.']"""

Material and methods:   107 patients with PCa in AS between 2005 and 2018 have been evaluated retrospectively. Groups were divided into two groups according to the need for additional treatment. Group 1 received additional treatment, group 2 did not receive additional treatments and active surveillance was continued. Patient's total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA), prostate-specific antigen density (PSA-D), total core involvement count, quantity and rate at biopsy pathology results and follow-up period were recorded and compared in the two groups.  Results:   The current cohort includes 107 patients. Mean age at diagnosis was 63.01years. Mean tPSA values at diagnosis were 6.09 ng/mL and 5.2 ng/mL in the group 1 and group 2, respectively. Mean follow-up period was 38.1 months (range, 12 to 134 months). Only PSA-D measurement significantly predicted need for additional treatment (p = 0.017).

Material and methods:   A total of 85 consecutive patients (mean age 66; IQR 62-71) with clinically suspected PCa were studied with multiparametric magnetic resonance of prostate before prostate biopsies. The prostate biopsies were RM-guided (60 inbore biopsy (MR-GB) and 25 Fusion-biopsy (FB). A total of 72 cases were eligible for robotic RP. An experienced genitourinary pathologist reviewed the histopathology of the tissue specimens of the patients after RP. The exclusion criteria were as follows: previous hormonotherapy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy for others cancers.  Results:   Based on the histological diagnosis, after RP, 68 anterior prostate cancer, and 107 posterior lesions were found. We further subcategorized lesions into peripheral and central zones for each the anterior and posterior lesions. The specific distribution of lesions by pathologic stage was: T2 = 74 (42.3%), T3a = 87 (49.7%), T3b = 12 (6.9%), T4 = 2 (1.1%) cases. Tumor volume of posterior neoplasms ranged from 0.04 to 20.35 cm3, with a median of 3.39 cm3. Anterior tumor volume ranged from 0.17 to 15 cm3, with a median volume of 2.54 cm3: PPCa were larger than APCa but the difference in size was not significant. The prostate cancer grade group (GG) I was distributed as 16.6% and 36% in anterior and posterior lesions cases. GG II and III was 43.8% and 31.5% in anterior and posterior cases, respectively. Comparatively, GG IV-V showed 39.6% and 32.5% for anterior and posterior lesions respectively (p < 0.001). Extraprostatic extention of neoplasm (EPE) was found more frequently in anterior cases (31.4%) than in in posterior cases (25.1%), but without significant difference. Lymphovascular invasion was similar in both the groups: 24% and 28.6% in anterior and posterior group, respectively. Anterior lesions showed a significantly higher rate of lymph node metastasis (9.3%) than posterior lesions (3.4%) (p < 0.005).  Conclusion:   In our study, we have found EPE, often associated with worse prognosis, more frequently (but not significantly) present in anterior lesions among PCa patients. Although posterior lesions are often related to pT3b stage, in our findings, anterior lesions were more often associated with a more aggressive neoplasm with more frequent nodal involvements.""","""[""Daniele D'Agostino"", 'Paolo Corsi', 'Michele Colicchia', 'Daniele Romagnoli', 'Gian Maria Busetto', 'Matteo Ferro', 'Alessandro Tafuri', 'Matteo Cevenini', 'Federico Mineo Bianchi', 'Marco Giampaoli', 'Angelo Porreca']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Arch Ital Urol Androl""","""['Clinicopathologic Significance of Anterior Prostate Cancer: Comparison With Posterior Prostate Cancer in the Era of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-transectal ultrasound image-fusion biopsies accurately characterize the index tumor: correlation with step-sectioned radical prostatectomy specimens in 135 patients.', 'Prognostic performance of magnetic resonance imaging-guided biopsy in defining prostate cancer anterior lesions.', 'Clinicopathologic features and outcomes of anterior-dominant prostate cancer: implications for diagnosis and treatment.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Dosimetric Analysis of the Short-Ranged Particle Emitter 161Tb for Radionuclide Therapy of Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'MRI and Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer.']"""

MATERIAL AND METHODS Data from TCGA and Oncomine databases were analyzed to determine the expression of EZH2 and the top five coexpressed genes in breast cancer, glioblastoma, and prostate cancer and the clinical significance the coexpressed genes. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was performed to predict the functions and pathways of EZH2 using pathway annotation. The role of EZH2 in the C4-2 human prostate cancer cell line was studied in vitro. RESULTS Analysis of 16 micro-arrays identified 185 genes that were coexpressed with EZH2. The top five coexpressed genes were MCM4, KIAA0101, MKI67, RRM2, and CDC25a. Increased expression of these genes and EZH2 were associated with reduced survival. Coexpressed genes were involved in biological networks associated with the cell cycle, mitosis, and DNA damage.

Materials and methods:   Retrospective analysis of 446 patients with at least one of the following APF: Gleason score ≥8, pathologic stage ≥pT3 and/or positive surgical margins. BR criteria used was PSA level over 0.4ng/ml. A survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier was performed to compare the different variable categories with log-rank test. In order to identify risk factors for SRT response and cancer specific survival (CSS) we performed univariate and multivariate analyses using Cox regression.  Results:   Mean follow up: 72 (IQR 27-122) months, mean time to BR: 42 (IQR 20-112) months, mean PSA level at BR: 0.56 (IQR 0.42-0.96). BR was present in 36.3% of the patients. Biochemical response to SRT was observed in 121 (75.7%) patients. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates after SRT at 3, 5, 8 and 10years were 95.7%, 92.3%, 87.9%, and 85%; overall survival (OS) rates after 5, 10 and 15years was 95.6%, 86.5% and 73.5%, respectively. CSS rates at 5, 10 and 15years were 99.1%, 98.1% and 96.6%. Only time to BR <24months (HR=2.55, P=.01) was identified as an independent risk factor for RFS after SRT.  Conclusions:   In these patients, RP only controls the disease in approximately half of the cases. Multimodal sequential treatment (RP+SRT when needed) increases this control, achieving high CSS rates and biochemical control in over 87% of the patients.

We examined the utilization of patients with aRT with adverse features at RP and patients with very aggressive disease (at least 2 of the following: ≥pT3b, pathological Gleason 8-10, and pN1). Regression analysis examined the relationship of various predictors of utilization adjusting to confounders. Pseudo R2 analysis examined the magnitude of influence that each variable had on the decision to use aRT.  Results:   Within the National Cancer Database cohort, only 11.7% of our patients received aRT. In patients with very aggressive disease, aRT utilization rate was 28.9%. Within the SEER cohort, 16.3% of patients with any adverse features at time of RP received aRT. In patients with very aggressive disease, only 30% of patients received aRT. Further, year of diagnosis, Gleason grade, pathologic stage, and positive surgical margin were the variables that had the greatest influence on the decision to use aRT, and that positive surgical margin, type of institution at which care was received, and lymph node involvement were the most influential variables in patients with very aggressive disease.

Material and methods:   The clinical records of all mCRPC patients treated with docetaxel and referred to our department for 68Ga-PSMA I&T PET/CT imaging were retrospectively analysed. Sixteen patients (mean age 69 years, range 52-82 years) with castration-resistant prostate cancer patients receiving palliative docetaxel therapy and had undergone 68Ga-PSMA I&T PET/CT scan were included in the study. 68Ga-PSMA I&T PET/CT imaging was done and prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels were measured at baseline before administration of docetaxel (PET1) and after at least 3 cycles (range 4-12) of chemotherapy (PET2). Patient-based as well as lesion-based comparison of PET2 findings with PET1 findings were done.  Results:   The change (decrease) observed in lymph node and prostate gland/prostatic bed SUVmax values after treatment compared to pretreatment was found to be statistically significant (P=.033). 3/16 patients (19%) were classified as progressive disease (PD), 4/16 (25%) as stable disease (SD), 9/16 (56%) as partial remission (PR) radiologically.

Methods:   In all, 140 prostate cancer patients with one or more postoperative anastomotic strictures after radical prostatectomy were included. All patients underwent transurethral anastomotic resection at the University Hospital of Munich between January 2009 and May 2016. Clinical data and follow-up information were retrieved from patients' records. Statistical analysis was done using Kaplan-Meier curves and log rank-test with time to first transurethral anastomotic resection as endpoint, Chi-square-test, and Mann-Whitney-U test.  Results:   In all, 140 patients with a median age of 67 years (IQR: 61-71 years) underwent radical prostatectomy. Median age at time of transurethral anastomotic resection was 68 years (IQR: 62-72). Patients needed 2 surgical interventions in median (range: 1-15). Median time from radical prostatectomy to transurethral anastomotic resection was 6 months (IQR: 3.9-17.4). Median duration of catheterization after radical prostatectomy was 10 days (IQR: 8-13). In all, 26% (36/140) received additional radiotherapy. Regarding time to first transurethral anastomotic resection, age and longer duration of catheterization after radical prostatectomy with a cutoff of 7 days showed no statistically significant differences (p = 0.392 and p = 0.141, respectively). Tumor stage was no predictor for development of anastomotic strictures (p = 0.892), and neither was prior adjuvant radiation (p = 0.162). Potential risk factors were compared between patients with up to 2 strictures (low-risk) and patients developing > 2 strictures (high-risk): high-risk patients had more often injection of cortisone during surgery (14% vs 0%, p < 0.001) and more frequently advanced tumor stage pT > 2 (54% vs 38%, p = 0.055), respectively.

PTX-induced apoptosis is associated with p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase or stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/ SAPK) pathways. Transforming growth factor-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1) play an important role in cell apoptosis through the p38, ERK, NF-κB and JNK signal transduction pathways. To investigate the role of TAK1 in PTX-induced cell apoptosis, we treated HEK293 and 8305C cells with 0-20 µM PTX for 6, 12 or 24 h. To investigate whether TAK1 can cooperate with PTX for cancer treatment, we transfected cells with TAK1, TAB1 or control plasmid and treated them with PTX (3-10 µM) for 9-24 h. Apoptosis rates were analysed by flow cytometry (Annexin V/PI). Endogenous TAK1 and TAB1, caspase-7 cleavage, poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage, Bcl-xL level, phospho-p44/42, phospho-JNK and phospho-p38 were detected by western blot. We show that in HEK293 and 8305C cells, PTX enhanced the endogenous TAK1/TAB1 level and induced cell apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Upon TAK1 overexpression in HEK293 cells treated with PTX, apoptosis rate, JNK phosphorylation and PARP cleavage increased contrary to heat-shocked or untreated cells. CRISPR editing of the tak1 gene upon PTX treatment resulted in lower phospho-JNK and PARP cleavage levels than in cells transfected with the control or the TAK1- or TAB1 + TAK1-containing plasmids. TAK1-K63A could not induce JNK phosphorylation or PARP cleavage. We conclude that PTX induces HEK293 and 8305C cell apoptosis through the TAK1-JNK activation pathway, potentially highlighting TAK1's role in chemosensitivity.""","""['Di Yu-Wei', 'Zhuo-Sheng Li', 'Shu-Min Xiong', 'Ge Huang', 'Yan-Fei Luo', 'Tie-Ying Huo', 'Mao-Hua Zhou', 'You-Wei Zheng']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""FEBS Open Bio""","""['Paclitaxel induces prolonged activation of the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway independently of activating the programmed cell death machinery.', 'Tongguanteng injection reverses paclitaxel resistance via upregulation of TAB1 expression in ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo.', 'Paclitaxel induces apoptosis in leukemia cells through a JNK activation-dependent pathway.', 'Involvement of Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-directed, caspase-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 Cleavage, c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation, and subsequent Bcl-2 phosphorylation for paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells.', 'TAK1 mediates convergence of cellular signals for death and survival.', 'Construction of Curcumin and Paclitaxel Co-Loaded Lipid Nano Platform and Evaluation of Its Anti-Hepatoma Activity in vitro and Pharmacokinetics in vivo.', 'GZ17-6.02 kills prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'lncRNA EGFEM1P promotes thyroid cancer progression by acting as an miR-369-3p sponge and upregulating TCF4.', 'Melatonin controls cell proliferation and modulates mitochondrial physiology in pancreatic stellate cells.', 'Transcriptome Reveals Granulosa Cells Coping through Redox, Inflammatory and Metabolic Mechanisms under Acute Heat Stress.']"""

Despite various treatments, all patients succumb to resistant disease, suggesting that there is a pressing need for novel and more efficacious treatments. Members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family play key roles in the tumorigenesis of mCRPC, indicating that VEGF-targeted therapies may have potential anti-tumor efficacy in this malignancy. However, due to compensatory activation of other family members, clinical trials with single-targeted VEGF inhibitors were discouraging. Here, we determined the anti-neoplastic activity of Cediranib, a pan-VEGF receptor inhibitor, in the mCRPC cell lines. Anti-growth effects of Cediranib were studied by MTT and BrdU cell proliferation assays and crystal violet staining. Annexin V/PI, radiation therapy and cell motility assays were carried out to examine the effects of Cediranib on apoptosis, radio-sensitivity and cell motility. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analyses were conducted to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-tumor activity of Cediranib. Cediranib decreased cell viability and induced apoptosis via inhibition of the anti-apoptotic proteins.

Materials and methods:   A total of 82 patients (median age 69 years) with locally recurrent prostate cancer after previous external beam radiation therapy (43/82, 52.4%), prostatectomy and adjuvant radiation therapy (24/82, 29.3%) or brachytherapy (15/82, 18.3%) were treated with sole salvage interstitial pulsed-dose rate brachytherapy (PDR-BT). The treatment regimen consisted of two PDR-BT sections with 30 Gy (single pulse dose 0.6 Gy/h, 24 h per day) each up to a total reference dose of 60 Gy (EQD2 = 71.5 Gy-eq). The endpoints of the present analysis are cumulative local recurrence-rate, PSA-free survival, overall survival and the treatment-associated late toxicity according to the ""Common Toxicity Criteria"" with a median follow-up of 49 months (range, 12-129 months).  Results:   The 5-y. overall cumulative local recurrence rate was 17.7% with no significant differences between low, intermediate and high-risk groups. Differences in PSA-free survival were marginally non-significant, at 67.3%, 70.4% and 63.8% for low, intermediate and high risk group, respectively.

Objective:   To assess the effect of our modified apical dissection and lateral prostatic fascia preservation (mod-RALP) technique on early functional outcomes.  Design, setting, and participants:   Among 2168 patients who underwent RALP between 2017 and 2019, 104 received a mod-RALP, and for the purposes of this study they were propensity score (PS) matched with a control group of conventional RALP cases based on preoperative and histological characteristics.  Surgical procedure:   In the mod-RALP technique, significant dissection of the apical complex was avoided with maximized preservation of periurethral tissue around the urethral stump. Nerve sparing was also modified with intrafascial dissection inside of the lateral fascia, leaving the lateral tissue including the neurovascular bundle (NVB) untouched and covered.  Measurements:   The mod-RALP and conventional RALP groups were compared for continence and potency recovery at 1 and 6 wk postoperatively, as well as at 3, 6, and 12 mo. Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox regression models were used to identify survival estimations and their predictors.  Results and limitations:   The mod-RALP technique resulted in faster continence (mean 46 vs 70 d) and potency (mean 74 vs 118 d, p < 0.05 for both) recovery. Functional recovery rates at postoperative follow-up were significantly higher in the mod-RALP group at all time points within the first 6 mo following surgery. Multivariate analyses revealed age, baseline functional status, surgical technique, and lymph node dissection as independent predictors of early functional recovery. This study is limited by its retrospective design and small size of the study groups.  Conclusions:   Our results with a modified technique intended to better preserve the apical complex and NVBs suggest earlier recovery of urinary continence and sexual function. These results should be tested with future randomized studies.

There is a lack of data in this population for active surveillance. Published series are retrospective or have small samples and results are discordant. The objective was to determinate whether actual active surveillance modalities can be applied for Afro-Caribbean men by comparing their oncological outcomes with Caucasian men.  Methods:   A total of 449 consecutive patients who underwent active surveillance for favorable-risk prostate cancer in two French University-Medical-Centers between 2005 and 2018: 261 in Guadeloupe, French West Indies, and 188 in Bordeaux, metropolitan France. Median follow-up was 56 months, (95% CI [32-81]) and 52 months (95% CI [30-75]), respectively (P=0.07). Curative treatment was given in case of histological, biological, or imaging progression, or upon patient demand. Primary endpoints were treatment-free, overall and specific survival. Secondary outcomes were reasons of discontinuating active surveillance, histological poor prognosis factors after prostatectomy, CAPRA-S score, biochemical-recurrence-free after treatment and metastasis-free survival. Kaplan-Meier method was used.  Results:   Median treatment free survival was 58.4 months (CI 95% [48.6-83.1]) for ACM and not reached at 120 months for CM (P=0.002). Overall survival (P=0.53), and specific survival (P=0.21) were similar in the two groups. CM were likely to have poor prognosis factor on prostatecomy piece (57 vs 30%, P=0.01). No difference for repartition of the CAPRA-S score (P=0.86), biochemical-recurrence-free (P=0.92) and metastasis-free (P=0.44) survival.  Conclusions:   Oncological outcomes for active surveillance of Afro-Caribbean and Caucasian men were similar in terms of mortality, recurrence and metastasis in our bicentric study, showing usability of current criteria for Afro-Caribbean.

Being able to accurately assess health utilities is crucial when deciding what is the best treatment when multiple and diverse treatment options exist, or when performing a cost / utility analysis. Due to the emotional and other complexities that may exist when such data are elicited, the values of the health utilities may be inaccurate and cause inconsistencies. Existing literature indicates that such inconsistencies may be very frequent. However, no method has been developed for dealing with such inconsistencies in an effective manner.  Methods:   Given a set of health utilities, this paper first explores ways for determining if there are any inconsistencies in their values. It also proposes a number of quadratic optimization approaches to best estimate the actual (and hence unknown) values when a set of initial health utility values are provided by the patient and certain inconsistencies have been detected. This is achieved by readjusting the initial values in a way that is minimal and also satisfies certain consistency requirements.  Results:   The proposed methods are applied on an illustrative example related to localized prostate cancer. Data from some published studies were used to illustrate how a set of initial values can be analyzed. This analysis aims at readjusting them in a minimal manner that would also satisfy some key numerical constraints pertinent to health utility values.  Conclusions:   The numerical results and the computational complexities of the proposed models indicate that the proposed approaches are practical as they involve quadratic optimization modeling. These approaches are novel as the problem of addressing numerical inconsistencies in the elicitation process of health utilities has not been addressed adequately. The approaches are also critical in shared decision making and also when performing cost / utility analyses because health utilities play a central role in determining the quality-adjusted life years when making decisions in these healthcare domains.""","""['Evangelos Triantaphyllou', 'Juri Yanase']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Artif Intell Med""","""['Treatment selection for life-critical shared decision making under ranges of health-state utility scenarios.', 'Health State Utility Values for Age-Related Macular Degeneration: Review and Advice.', 'Quality-adjusted life-years lack quality in pediatric care: a critical review of published cost-utility studies in child health.', 'Application of classic utilities to published pediatric cost-utility studies.', 'Predicting utility ratings for joint health States from single health States in prostate cancer: empirical testing of 3 alternative theories.', 'Estimating Joint Health State Utility Algorithms Under Partial Information.']"""

Here, we describe the development of an immune-related prognostic signature for predicting prostate cancer recurrence.  Methods:   Prostate cancer gene expression profiles for 477 prostate cases, as well as accompanying follow-up information were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and GEO. The samples were divided into 3 groups and immune gene sets significantly associated with prognosis were identified by evaluating the relationship between the expression of 1039 immune genes and prognosis in the training set. Relative expression levels of these genes were used to identify prognostic gene pairs. LASSO was used for feature selection and robust biomarkers selected. Finally, the identified immune prognostic markers were validated using dataset and GEO validation dataset and their performance compared with existing prognostic models.  Results:   In total, 87 immune genes, significantly associated with prognosis, were identified and 2447 immune gene pairs (IRGPs) established. Univariate survival analysis identified 641 prognosis-associated immune gene pairs. 8-IRGPs were obtained via LASSO feature selection and an 8-IRGPs signature established. The 8-IRGPs signature exhibited an independent prognosis value in prostate cancer of the training set, test set, and external validation set (p = <0.001). The 5- year survival AUC in both the training set and the validation set was >0.7. The 8-IRGPs outperformed clinical tumor classification features, including T, N, radiation therapy (RT) and targeted molecular therapy (TMT) (p <0.01). In addition, we compared the prognostic characteristics of 8-IRGPs with 3 reported prostate cancers and found that 8-IRGPs achieved a high C index (0.85) and had the highest predictive performance within 10 years of follow-up (HR: 10.5). Finally, we integrated T, N, RT, TMT, and 8-IRGPs and generated a novel alignment chart to aid the prediction of prostate cancer recurrence in individual patients (p <0.01).

While the C11-oxy C19 steroids have been firmly established in the steroid arena, the C11-oxy C21 steroids are now also of significance. The current study reports on a high-throughput ultra-performance convergence chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPC2-MS/MS) method for the separation and quantification of 52 steroids in peripheral serum, which include the C11-oxy C19 and C11-oxy C21 steroids. Fifteen deuterium-labelled steroids were included for absolute quantification, which incorporates steroid extraction efficiency, together with one steroid and four non-steroidal compounds serving as quality controls (QC). The 15 min run-time per sample (16 min injection-to-injection time with an 8-step gradient) quantifies 68 analytes in a 2 µL injection volume. A single chromatographic step simultaneously identifies steroids in the mineralocorticoid, glucocorticoid and androgen pathways in adrenal steroidogenesis, together with steroid metabolites produced in the periphery, presenting an analytical method for the application of screening in vivo clinical samples. This study highlights cross-talk between the C11-oxy steroids, and describes the optimisation of multiple reaction monitoring required to measure steroids accurately. The limit of detection for the steroid metabolites ranged from 0.002 to 20 ng/mL and the limit of quantification from 0.02 to 100 ng/mL. The calibration range for the steroids ranged from 0.002 to 1000 ng/mL and for the QC compounds from 0.075 to 750 ng/mL. The method is fully validated in terms of accuracy (%RSD, <13%), precision (including inter-day variability across a three-day period) (%RSD, <16%), recovery (average 102.42%), matrix effect (ranging from -15.25 to 14.25%) and process efficiency (average 101.79%). The dilution protocol for the steroids, internal standards and QC compounds were validated, while the ion ratios of the steroid metabolites (%RSD, <16%) and QC compounds were monitored and the accuracy bias values (%RSD, <9%) were within acceptable limits. The method was subsequently used to quantify steroid levels in a cohort of healthy women. C11-oxy steroid metabolites produced as intermediates in steroidogenic pathways, together with end-products included in the method can potentially characterise the 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione-, C21- and C11-oxy backdoor pathways in vivo. The identification of these C11-oxy C19 and C11-oxy C21 intermediates would allow insight into active pathways, while steroid metabolism could be traced in patients and reference ranges established in both normal and abnormal conditions. Furthermore, conditions currently undefined in terms of the C11-oxy steroids would benefit from the analysis provided by this method, while the C11-oxy steroids could be further explored in PCOS, 21OHD, CRPC and adrenarche.""","""['Therina du Toit', 'Desmaré van Rooyen', 'Maria A Stander', 'Stephen L Atkin', 'Amanda C Swart']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci""","""['A high-throughput UPC2-MS/MS method for the separation and quantification of C19 and C21 steroids and their C11-oxy steroid metabolites in the classical, alternative, backdoor and 11OHA4 steroid pathways.', 'The 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione pathway and C11-oxy C21 backdoor pathway are active in benign prostatic hyperplasia yielding 11keto-testosterone and 11keto-progesterone.', 'Profiling adrenal 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione metabolites in prostate cancer cells, tissue and plasma: UPC2-MS/MS quantification of 11β-hydroxytestosterone, 11keto-testosterone and 11keto-dihydrotestosterone.', 'Back where it belongs: 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione compels the re-assessment of C11-oxy androgens in steroidogenesis.', 'Advances in the analytical methodologies: Profiling steroids in familiar pathways-challenging dogmas.']"""

Cell based assays and in silico docking analysis led us to discover that these new compounds exhibit inhibitory effect on anoctamin1 (ANO1). ANO1 is amplified and highly expressed in various carcinomas including prostate cancer, esophageal cancer, breast cancer, and pancreatic cancer. Biological assays revealed that (E)-1-(7,7-dimethyl-7H-furo[2,3-f]chromen-2-yl)-3-(1H-pyrrol-2-yl)prop-2-en-1-one (3n, Ani-FCC) is a novel, potent and selective ANO1 inhibitor with an IC50 value of 1.23 μM. 3n showed 144 times stronger activity on ANO1 inhibition than ANO2 inhibition and did not alter the chloride channel activity of CFTR and the intracellular calcium signaling.

First, the biological capacity of lncAMPC in PCa was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. The lncAMPC was overexpressed in tumor tissue and urine of metastatic PCa patients and promoted PCa tumorigenesis and metastasis. Then, a mechanism study was conducted to determine how the lncAMPC-activated pathway contributed to PCa metastasis and immunosuppression. In the cytoplasm, lncAMPC upregulated LIF expression by sponging miR-637 and inhibiting its activity. In the nucleus, lncAMPC enhanced LIFR transcription by decoying histone H1.2 away from the upstream sequence of the LIFR gene. The lncAMPC-activated LIF/LIFR expressions stimulated the Jak1-STAT3 pathway to simultaneously maintain programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) protein stability and promote metastasis-associated gene expression. Finally, the prognostic value of the expression of lncAMPC and its downstream genes in PCa patients was evaluated.

In addition, it is the second cause of death after lung cancer. Occurrence of the prostate cancer is variable in various regions of the world. Solely, there are three known risk factors for the prostate cancer, including: Age, inheritance and ethnic origin. ELAC2 protein is a phosphodiesterase enzyme encoded by ELAC2 gene in human. This gene is placed on chromosome 17, and it is believed that product of the mentioned gene is an endonuclease contributed in puberty of mitochondrion's tRNA. From clinical viewpoint, variables of ELAC2 gene such as Ser217Leu and Ala541Thr Missense mutations which are accompanied by hereditary prostate cancer (HPC2).Objective of this study is to investigate Ser217Leu (rs4792311) and Ala541Thr (rs5030739) polymorphisms in the individuals with prostate cancer or those who are suspicious of prostate cancer with family past record/history.  Study method:   In this study conducted by case-control method in 2018, 102 men with prostate cancer and 98 men being suspicious of prostate cancer out of 10 families referred to shahid Rajaei Hospital in Tonekabon county to study and check were investigated. After collection of data using questionnaire, sampling from individuals and performance of the rest steps, study of polymorphism was carried out by PCR sequencing technique, and the results were analyzed by Chromas software.  Finding:   Of the total studied 102 individuals, 44 individuals (43.1%) were homozygote for Ser217Leu mutation, 36 individuals (35.2%) were heterozygote and 22 individuals (21.5%) lacked Missense mutation. for Ala541Thr mutation, 18 ones (17.6%) were heterozygote and 84 ones (82.3%) lacked Missense mutation. For Ser217Leu mutation, out of 98 suspicious individuals, 21 individuals (21.4%) were homozygote. 6 individuals (6.1%) were heterozygote and 71 individuals (72.4%) lacked the mutation. For Ala541Thr mutation, 15 ones (15.3%) were homozygote and 84 ones (84.6%) lacked the studied mutation.  Conclusion:   Results of this research showed that, in the individuals with the prostate cancer, there is a relationship between Ser217Leu and Ala541Thr polymorphism of ELAC2 gene and/with prostate cancer, and the suspicious individuals gotten involved in the mutation must take action to prevent this cancer.<br />.""","""['Zahra Zahiri', 'Fatemeh Zahiri']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Carriage of Ser217Leu and Ala541Thr Variants of ELAC2 Gene and Risk Factors in Patients with Prostate Cancer in Burkina Faso.', 'Ser217Leu polymorphism of the HPC2/ELAC2 gene associated with prostatic cancer risk in Japanese men.', 'ELAC2/HPC2 polymorphisms, prostate-specific antigen levels, and prostate cancer.', 'Genetic analysis of the principal genes related to prostate cancer: a review.', 'The complex genetic epidemiology of prostate cancer.', 'Carriage of Ser217Leu and Ala541Thr Variants of ELAC2 Gene and Risk Factors in Patients with Prostate Cancer in Burkina Faso.']"""

Patients and methods:   This retrospective single tertiary referral institution cohort study of men reviewed the results of 68 Ga-PSMA-11 positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scans performed for primary staging prior to treatment of prostate cancer from July 2014 to September 2019. Men with PSMA uptake outside the prostate in only the rib lesion were included. A solitary rib lesion was considered to be malignant if it increased in size on follow-up imaging. A lesion was considered benign if the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level remained <0.1 µg/L following a radical prostatectomy (RP), <2 µg/L above nadir following radiotherapy (RT) as per the Phoenix criteria, histology was benign on rib biopsy, or follow-up imaging showed no growth of the rib lesion. If a lesion did not meet these criteria it was considered indeterminate.  Results:   A total of 62 men had PSMA uptake in a solitary rib lesion; 54 went on to have RPs and eight underwent RT. In all, 61 of the men (98.4%) met the criteria for a benign rib lesion. Only one man had a false-negative malignant lesion. This man had a rib lesion with a low maximum standardised uptake value (SUVmax ) of 2.21 reported as benign, but the postoperative PSA level was 0.67 µg/L and the rib lesion progressed on follow-up imaging, with development of widespread metastases. Of the benign rib lesions, there were four false positives reported as possible metastases. Three had percutaneous rib biopsies, two of which came back with benign histology and one was indeterminate. The indeterminate biopsy patient had a RP and his postoperative PSA level was <0.1 µg/L. A total of 43 (69.4%) men with benign rib lesions had a SUVmax greater than the SUVmax of the malignant lesion.  Conclusion:   To our knowledge, this is the first cohort study of men with PSMA-avid solitary rib lesions on pre-treatment 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT staging scans for prostate cancer. Our results indicate that the vast majority of these lesions have low-intensity uptake and are benign.

The effectiveness of HDAC inhibitors has been demonstrated by preclinical models, but not in clinical studies, probably due to the ineffectively accumulation of HDACI in prostate cancer cells. The purpose of this work was to evaluate effects of a novel HDACI (CN133) on CRPC xenograft model and 22Rv1 cells, and develops methods, PET/CT imaging, to detect the therapeutic effects of CN133 on this cancer.  Methods:   We designed and performed study to compare the effects of CN133 with SAHA on the 22Rv1 xenograft model and 22Rv1 cells. Using PET/CT imaging with [11C] Martinostat and [18F] FDG, we imaged mice bearing 22Rv1 xenografts before and after 21-day treatment with placebo and CN133 (1 mg/kg), and uptake on pre-treatment and post-treatment imaging was measured. The anti-tumor mechanisms of CN133 were investigated by qPCR, western blot, and ChIP-qPCR.  Results:   Our data showed that the CN133 treatment led to a 50% reduction of tumor volume compared to the placebo that was more efficacious than SAHA treatment in this preclinical model. [11C] Martinostat PET imaging could identify early lesions of prostate cancer and can also be used to monitor the therapeutic effect of CN133 in CRPC. Using pharmacological approaches, we demonstrated that effects of CN133 showed almost 100-fold efficacy than SAHA treatment in the experiment of cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. The anti-tumor mechanisms of CN133 were due to the inhibition of AR signaling pathway activity by decreased HDAC 2 and 3 protein expressions.  Conclusion:   Taken together, these studies provide not only a novel epigenetic approach for prostate cancer therapy but also offering a potential tool, [11C] Martinostat PET/CT imaging, to detect the early phase of prostate cancer and monitor therapeutic effect of CN133.

Therefore, the current study investigated the association between tumor distribution patterns and the biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival rate in pT2pN0R0 PCa.  Methods:   Following radical prostatectomy, the anatomical distribution of PCa in 743 men with pT1-pT3pN0 disease was analyzed to determine 20 types of PCa distribution patterns. Then, 245 men with pT2pN0R0 PCa was considered for prognostic evaluation with a mean follow-up period of 60 months. The spatial distribution patterns of PCa were evaluated using a cMDX©-based map model of the prostate. An analysis including 552,049 comparison operations was performed to assist in the evaluation of the similarity levels of the distribution patterns. A k-mean cluster analysis was applied to determine groups with similar distribution patterns. A decision-tree analysis was performed to divide these groups according to frequency of BCR. The BCR-free survival rate was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves. Predictors of progression were investigated using a Cox proportional hazards model.  Results:   BCR occurred in 8.2% of the 245 men with pT2pN0R0 PCa. The median time of recurrence was 60 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 42-77). In univariate and multivariate analyses, the prostate volume and the distribution patterns were independent predictors for BCR, whereas the sub-staging of pT2 tumors, Gleason grading, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and relative tumor volume were not. In the patients with pT2pN0R0 disease, PCa distribution patterns with the apical involvement were significantly associated with the risk of BCR (P = 0.001).  Conclusion:   The spread tumor patterns with the apical involvement are associated with a high-risk of BCR in the pT2 tumor stage.

Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed 499 patients who had positive mpMRI (PI-RADSv2 ≥ 3) and MRI-targeted biopsy. The training cohort comprised 449 men, including a calibration set of 50 men. Biopsy decision strategies included using risk estimates from the CNN (original and calibrated), to perform biopsy in men with PI-RADSv2 ≥ 4 only, or additionally in men with PI-RADSv2 3 and PSA density (PSAd) ≥ 0.15 ng/ml/ml. Discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness in the unseen test cohort (n = 50) were assessed using C-statistic, calibration plots and DCA, respectively.  Results:   The calibrated CNN achieved moderate calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow calibration test, p = 0.41) and good discrimination (C = 0.85). DCA revealed consistently higher net benefit and net reduction in biopsies for the calibrated CNN compared with the original CNN, PI-RADSv2 ≥ 4 and the combined strategy of PI-RADSv2 and PSAd. Original CNN predictions were severely miscalibrated (p < 0.0001) resulting in net harm compared with a 'biopsy all' patients strategy. At-risk thresholds ≥ 10% using the calibrated CNN and the combined strategy reduced the number of biopsies by an estimated 201 and 55 men, respectively, per 1000 men at risk, without missing csPCa, while original CNN and PI-RADSv2 ≥ 4 could not achieve a net reduction in biopsies.  Conclusions:   DCA revealed that our calibrated 3D-CNN resulted in fewer unnecessary biopsies compared with using PI-RADSv2 alone or in combination with PSAd. CNN calibration is important in achieving clinical utility.  Key points:   • A 3D deep learning model applied to multiparametric MRI may help to prevent unnecessary prostate biopsies in patients eligible for MRI-targeted biopsy. • Owing to miscalibration, original risk estimates by the deep learning model require prior calibration to enable clinical utility. • Decision curve analysis confirmed a net benefit of using our calibrated deep learning model for biopsy decisions compared with alternative strategies, including PI-RADSv2 alone and in combination with prostate-specific antigen density.""","""['Dominik Deniffel', 'Nabila Abraham', 'Khashayar Namdar', 'Xin Dong', 'Emmanuel Salinas', 'Laurent Milot', 'Farzad Khalvati', 'Masoom A Haider']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Avoiding Unnecessary Biopsy: MRI-based Risk Models versus a PI-RADS and PSA Density Strategy for Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', 'Comparison of different thresholds of PSA density for risk stratification of PI-RADSv2.1 categories on prostate MRI.', 'Combined Clinical Parameters and Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Advanced Risk Modeling of Prostate Cancer-Patient-tailored Risk Stratification Can Reduce Unnecessary Biopsies.', 'Multivariate risk prediction tools including MRI for individualized biopsy decision in prostate cancer diagnosis: current status and future directions.', 'Diagnostic Performance of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2 for Detection of Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Diagnostic Meta-analysis.', 'What benefit can be obtained from magnetic resonance imaging diagnosis with artificial intelligence in prostate cancer compared with clinical assessments?', 'Psychotic disorders as a framework for precision psychiatry.', 'Comparative Performance of Deep Learning and Radiologists for the Diagnosis and Localization of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer at MRI: A Systematic Review.', 'A review of artificial intelligence in prostate cancer detection on imaging.', 'Improving breast cancer diagnostics with deep learning for MRI.']"""

Methods:   One hundred forty-seven consecutive patients on AS with mp-MRI (T2WI, DWI, DCE-MRI) at 3T were initially enrolled. Fifty-five received follow-up mp-MRI after a minimum interval of 12 months and subsequent targeted MR/US fusion-guided biopsy (FUS-GB) plus concurrent systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided (TRUS-GB) biopsy as reference standard. Primary endpoint was the negative predictive value (NPV) of the follow-up mp-MRI to exclude histopathologic tumor progression using PRECISE recommendations. Secondary endpoints were the positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, specificity, Gleason score (GS) upgrades, and comparison of biopsy method.  Results:   Of 55 patients, 29 (53%) had a GS upgrade on re-biopsy. All 29 patients showed a tumor progression on follow-up mp-MRI. Fifteen of 55 patients (27%) displayed signs of tumor progression, but had stable GS on re-biopsy. None of the 11 patients (20%) without signs of progression on follow-up mp-MRI had a GS upgrade on re-biopsy. The NPV was 100%, PPV was 66%, sensitivity was 100%, and specificity 42%. FUS-GB resulted in GS upgrade significantly more often (n = 28; 51%) compared with TRUS-GB (n = 12; 22%; p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   (Follow-up) Mp-MRI can reliably exclude PCa progression in patients on AS. Standard serial re-biopsies might be waived if follow-up mp-MRIs are stable. Over 60% of patients with signs of tumor progression on mp-MRI during AS had a GS upgrade on re-biopsy. Targeted re-biopsies should be performed if cancer progression or higher-grade PCa is suspected on mp-MRI.  Key points:   • None of the patients with unsuspicious mp-MRI had a GS upgrade in re-biopsy and mp-MRI might replace serial biopsies in these cases • More than 60% of patients with mp-MRI signs of tumor progression had subsequent Gleason score (GS) upgrades • Targeted re-biopsies should be performed in case of higher GS cancer suspicion on mp-MRI.""","""['T Ullrich', 'C Arsov', 'M Quentin', 'F Mones', 'A C Westphalen', 'D Mally', 'A Hiester', 'P Albers', 'G Antoch', 'L Schimmöller']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Value of Serial Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging-guided Biopsies in Men with Low-risk Prostate Cancer on Active Surveillance After 1 Yr Follow-up.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Prospective randomized trial comparing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided in-bore biopsy to MRI-ultrasound fusion and transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy in patients with prior negative biopsies.', 'Prebiopsy Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis in Biopsy-naive Men with Suspected Prostate Cancer Based on Elevated Prostate-specific Antigen Values: Results from a Randomized Prospective Blinded Controlled Trial.', 'Comparing Three Different Techniques for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Prostate Biopsies: A Systematic Review of In-bore versus Magnetic Resonance Imaging-transrectal Ultrasound fusion versus Cognitive Registration.

However, neither Sipuleucel-T nor other experimental PCa vaccines that emerged later induce strong T-cell immunity.  Methods:   In this first-in-man study, VANCE, we evaluated a novel vaccination platform based on two replication-deficient viruses, chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd) and MVA (Modified Vaccinia Ankara), targeting the oncofetal self-antigen 5T4 in early stage PCa. Forty patients, either newly diagnosed with early-stage PCa and scheduled for radical prostatectomy or patients with stable disease on an active surveillance protocol, were recruited to the study to assess the vaccine safety and T-cell immunogenicity. Secondary and exploratory endpoints included immune infiltration into the prostate, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) change, and assessment of phenotype and functionality of antigen-specific T cells.  Results:   The vaccine had an excellent safety profile. Vaccination-induced 5T4-specific T-cell responses were measured in blood by ex vivo IFN-γ ELISpot and were detected in the majority of patients with a mean level in responders of 198 spot-forming cells per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated the presence of both CD8+ and CD4+ polyfunctional 5T4-specific T cells in the circulation. 5T4-reactive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were isolated from post-treatment prostate tissue. Some of the patients had a transient PSA rise 2-8 weeks following vaccination, possibly indicating an inflammatory response in the target organ.  Conclusions:   An excellent safety profile and T-cell responses elicited in the circulation and also detected in the prostate gland support the evaluation of the ChAdOx1-MVA 5T4 vaccine in efficacy trials. It remains to be seen if this vaccination strategy generates immune responses of sufficient magnitude to mediate clinical efficacy and whether it can be effective in late-stage PCa settings, as a monotherapy in advanced disease or as part of multi-modality PCa therapy. To address these questions, the phase I/II trial, ADVANCE, is currently recruiting patients with intermediate-risk PCa, and patients with advanced metastatic castration-resistant PCa, to receive this vaccine in combination with nivolumab.

The current criterion to define this clinical state is based on manual bone metastasis counts, but enumeration of bone metastases is limited by interobserver variations, and it does not account for metastasis volume or lesional coalescence. The automated bone scan index (aBSI) is a quantitative method of evaluating bone metastatic burden in a standardised and reproducible manner.  Objective:   To evaluate whether aBSI has utility as a predictive imaging biomarker to define a newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer population that might benefit from the addition of prostate RT to standard of care (SOC) systemic therapy.  Design, setting, and participants:   This is an exploratory analysis of men with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either SOC or SOC + prostate RT within the STAMPEDE ""M1|RT comparison"".  Intervention:   The SOC was lifelong androgen deprivation therapy, with up-front docetaxel permitted from December 2015. Men allocated RT received either a daily or a weekly schedule that was nominated before randomisation.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Baseline bone scans were evaluated retrospectively to calculate aBSI. We used overall (OS) and failure-free (FFS) survival as the end points. Treatment-aBSI interaction was evaluated using the multivariable fractional polynomial interaction (MFPI) and subpopulation treatment effect pattern plot. Further analysis was done in aBSI quartiles using Cox regression models adjusted for stratification factors.  Results and limitations:   Baseline bone scans for 660 (SOC: 323 and SOC + RT: 337) of 2061 men randomised within the ""M1|RT comparison"" met the software requirements for aBSI calculation. The median age was 68 yr, median PSA was 100 ng/mL, median aBSI was 0.9, and median follow-up was 39 mo. Baseline patient characteristics including aBSI were balanced between the treatment groups. Using the MFPI procedure, there was evidence of aBSI-treatment interaction for OS (p = 0.04, MFPI procedure) and FFS (p < 0.01, MFPI procedure). Graphical evaluation of estimated treatment effect plots showed that the OS and FFS benefit from prostate RT was greatest in patients with a low aBSI. Further analysis in quartiles based on aBSI supported this finding.  Conclusions:   A low automated bone scan index is predictive of survival benefit associated with prostate RT in men with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer.

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether different iPSA levels were associated with dissimilar clinical outcomes among men with high-grade PCa and advanced disease after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RaLRP).  Methods:   This study enrolled 69 PCa patients with initial Gleason score ≥8 and pathologic T-stage ≥3a from April 2012 to December 2018. Patients were stratified into 3 groups based on iPSA levels at diagnosis: <5.0, 5.0-9.9, and ≥10.0. The patients' related parameters were compared among these groups.  Results:   The median follow-up period was 33.1 months (IQR: 12.1-48.1). There was no difference in biochemical recurrence (BCR) between the 3 groups (Log-rank test, p = 0.484). We found a higher risk of biochemical recurrence in patients with positive surgical margins (HR: 5.04, 95% CI: 1.64-15.50, p = 0.005). In addition, patients with low iPSA levels (<5.0 ng/mL) had poor radiographic progression-free survival (Log-rank test, p = 0.001) and a higher risk of disease progression (HR: 12.2, 95% CI: 1.18-1260.99, p = 0.036) compared with patients with higher iPSA levels (≥10 ng/mL).  Conclusion:   In patients with high-grade locally-advanced PCa, a low iPSA level was associated with a higher risk of disease progression, but not with biochemical recurrence. In this unique population, serum PSA may not be a reliable marker to detect disease progression. Monitoring of these patients may warrant other biomarkers or imaging.""","""['Yu-Cheng Lu', 'Chao-Yuan Huang', 'Yu-Chuan Lu', 'Kuo-How Huang', 'Po-Ming Chow', 'Yi-Kai Chang', 'Fan-Ching Hung', 'Chung-Hsin Chen', 'Fu-Shan Jaw', 'Jian-Hua Hong']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Formos Med Assoc""","""['Stage T1-2 prostate cancer: a multivariate analysis of factors affecting biochemical and clinical failures after radical prostatectomy.', 'Predictive factors and oncological outcomes of persistently elevated prostate-specific antigen in patients following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'The Role of Prostate-specific Antigen Persistence After Radical Prostatectomy for the Prediction of Clinical Progression and Cancer-specific Mortality in Node-positive Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'The presence of positive surgical margins in patients with organ-confined prostate cancer results in biochemical recurrence at a similar rate to that in patients with extracapsular extension and PSA ≤ 10 ng/ml.', 'Stratification of patient risk based on prostate-specific antigen doubling time after radical retropubic prostatectomy.', 'Propensity score matching analysis comparing radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy with androgen deprivation therapy in locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Emerging roles of JMJD3 in cancer.', 'Concomitant High Apoptosis Inhibitor of Macrophage (AIM) and Low Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Indicates Activated T Cell-Mediated Anticancer Immunity, Enhance Sensitivity to Pembrolizumab, and Elicit Good Prognosis in Prostate Cancer.']"""

In vitro cell culture of human prostate tumor cell line (PC-3) was used to determine cell viability as evidenced by MTT, neutral red, and LDH release using nine concentrations (0.24 to 30.72 µM) of each brachydin. A triple-fluorescent staining assay assessed the mechanism resulting in cell death. Genomic instability and protein expression were evaluated using comet assay and western blot analysis, respectively. The pro-oxidant status was analyzed using the5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA) probe. The IC50 values for brachydins BrA, BrB, and BrC were 23.41, 4.28, and 4.44 µM, respectively, and all compounds induced apoptosis and necrosis. BrB and BrC increased p21 levels indicating a possible G1 cell cycle arrest. BrA (6 µM) and BrB (3.84 µM) decreased phospho-AKT (AKT serine/threonine kinase) expression, which also influenced cell cycle and proliferation. BrA, BrB, and BrC elevated cleaved PARP (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase), a protein related to DNA repair and induction of apoptotic processes. Therefore, this study determined the IC50 values of brachydins in the PC-3 cell line as well as the influence on cell proliferation and cell death processes, such as apoptosis and necrosis, indicating the proteins involved in these processes.
