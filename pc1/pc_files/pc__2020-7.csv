A number of studies have shown that a subset of patients also express AR-V7 in the primary tumor. These findings have recently been challenged by a study showing that AR-V7 becomes only detectable in CRPC but is virtually absent in castration-naïve prostate cancer.  Methods:   Herein, we directly compare the two relevant antibodies used for the immunodetection of AR-V7 in the conflicting studies (clones AG10008 and RM7) in a predominantly high-risk prostate cancer patient cohort with primary tumor specimens assembled in a tissue microarray (TMA).  Results:   The overall rate of AR-V7 positive TMA cores was comparable (AG10008, 24.9%; RM7, 21%). However, the percentage agreement of identical staining intensities of positive cores was only 7%. In contrast, the percentage agreement of negative cores was 62.8%. In approximately 30% of the cores, the antibodies produced discordant staining intensities. Only one of the two antibody stainings (AG10008) conveyed prognostic information and was associated with a shorter progression-free patient survival.  Conclusions:   Our study underscores that nuclear AR-V7 expression can be detected in primary prostate cancer prior to long-term androgen deprivation and castration resistance. There are staining differences between the two antibodies in tumor tissue, for which we currently have no explanation. Clearly, improvements in the detection of functional AR-V7 in prostate cancer are urgently needed.""","""['Adam Kaczorowski', 'Xin Chen', 'Esther Herpel', 'Axel S Merseburger', 'Glen Kristiansen', 'Christof Bernemann', 'Markus Hohenfellner', 'Marcus V Cronauer', 'Stefan Duensing']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Treat Res Commun""","""['Detection of AR-V7 in primary prostate cancer.', 'AR-V7 biomarker testing for primary prostate cancer: The ongoing challenge of analytical validation and clinical qualification.', 'Analytical Validation and Clinical Qualification of a New Immunohistochemical Assay for Androgen Receptor Splice Variant-7 Protein Expression in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Overexpression of nuclear AR-V7 protein in primary prostate cancer is an independent negative prognostic marker in men with high-risk disease receiving adjuvant therapy.', 'Prognostic Value of Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 in the Treatment of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer with Next generation Androgen Receptor Signal Inhibition: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'ARV-7: A biomarker for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Methods for androgen receptor splice variant-7 detection: Advances in studies.', 'Assessment of Androgen Receptor Splice Variant-7 as a Biomarker of Clinical Response in Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor splice variant 7 detected by immunohistochemical is an independent poor prognostic marker in men receiving adjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy after radical prostatectomy.', 'AR-V7 biomarker testing for primary prostate cancer: The ongoing challenge of analytical validation and clinical qualification.', 'Using biochemistry and biophysics to extinguish androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer.', 'Clinical Actionability of the Genomic Landscape of Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

Therefore, it is imperative to study PCa biology to identify key molecules that can improve PCa management. In this study, eight prostate tumor tissues and paired normal tissues were analyzed using two approaches-Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy for spectroscopic profiling of biomolecules and antibody microarray for signaling proteins-with the main goal of identifying metabolic and proteomic changes that enable the distinction between normal and tumor conditions. Principal component analysis of FT-IR spectra revealed different spectroscopic signals for each condition. The most relevant changes in prostate tumor tissues identified by FT-IR were dysregulation in lipid metabolism, lower polysaccharide and glycogen content, higher nucleic acid content, and increased protein phosphorylation. Using an antibody microarray, 42 proteins were identified as differentially regulated between the two conditions; 14 of those revealed changes in their phosphorylation status. These proteins include transcription factors and kinases and constitute a highly-interconnected interaction network. Altogether, our data reveal metabolic and proteomic alterations that may be of interest in future translational studies aimed at establishing PCa prognosis and treatment. SIGNIFICANCE: Prostate tumor tissues and adjacent benign tissues were analyzed using two approaches-Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy for biomolecules and an antibody microarray for signaling proteins, which allowed to identify a panel of metabolic and proteomic alterations that may be of interest in future translational studies to enable the distinction between normal and tumor conditions.""","""['Juliana Felgueiras', 'Joana Vieira Silva', 'Alexandra Nunes', 'Inês Fernandes', 'António Patrício', 'Nuno Maia', 'Steven Pelech', 'Margarida Fardilha']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Proteomics""","""['Diagnosis of colon cancer with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy on the malignant colon tissue samples.', 'Translational Metabolomics of Head Injury: Exploring Dysfunctional Cerebral Metabolism with Ex Vivo NMR Spectroscopy-Based Metabolite Quantification.', 'Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy combined with chemometric modelling for the classification of clinically relevant Enterococci.', 'Metabolic profiling of recombinant Escherichia coli cultivations based on high-throughput FT-MIR spectroscopic analysis.', 'Secondary structure of food proteins by Fourier transform spectroscopy in the mid-infrared region.', 'The most effective but largely ignored target for prostate cancer early detection and intervention.', 'The Integration of Metabolomics with Other Omics: Insights into Understanding Prostate Cancer.', 'The Impact of Lifestyle on Prostate Cancer: A Road to the Discovery of New Biomarkers.', 'Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy as a Discriminatory Tool for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 Metabolism: A Pilot Study.', 'Metabolic Alterations in Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 and Their Correlation with Lipin.']"""

The cells were incubated in RPMI-1640 media at various concentrations of Pheophorbide-a. The media was treated with 0.5 W/cm2 ultrasound and/or 0.5 mJ/cm2 light irradiation. Cell proliferation in both cell lines was inhibited most effectively by sonophotodynamic therapy in comparison to that of both monotherapies. LNCaP cells were more sensitive to the applied treatments and the cell survival in LNCaP cell line was observed to be less than that of PC3 cell line. The results of histochemical analysis showed that there were more apoptotic cells in the treatment groups in comparison to control group. Additionally, the treatments induced apoptosis deduced by the overexpressed levels of caspase-3, caspase-8, PARP, and Bax proteins, while the expression levels of caspase-9 and Bcl-2 proteins were observed to be lower than those of control group. Treatments led to an increase in the oxidative stress markers, ROS and MDA, but a decrease in the activities of antioxidant enzymes, SOD, CAT and GSH.

Methods:   The de-identified Decipher Biosciences database, which includes expression for more than 46,000 coding and noncoding genes per patient, was queried for expression of FOLH1 (PSMA). Prostate cancer patients who underwent radical prostatectomy and received the Decipher Test were included in the analysis. PSMA expression was compared to the Gleason Grade Group, Decipher risk category (a validated 22 biomarker genomic score), basal versus luminal molecular subtype, and androgen receptor activity. Multivariable regression analyses were performed.  Results:   The Decipher de-identified Decipher Biosciences database contained 16,807 men who underwent prostatectomy with the average age being 65-year old and most being Gleason Grade Group 2 (35%) or 3 (27%).

Luminal subtype was found to have much higher PSMA expression when compared to basal (1.01 vs 0.68, P <.001). The androgen receptor activity signature demonstrated a dramatic difference between basal (0.19) and luminal (0.62) subtypes (P <.001). In the multivariable model, luminal patients, high androgen receptor activity scores, and high Grade Groups were significantly associated with higher FOLH1 percentile rank (P <.001).

Glycolysis is overactive in PCa and associated with poor prognosis, but the therapeutic efficacy of glycolysis inhibitors has thus far been limited by their inability to induce cell death. FV-429, a flavonoid derivative of Wogonin, is a glycolysis inhibitor that has shown anti-cancer promise. In this study, we used FV-429 as an anti-PCa agent and investigated its mechanisms of action. In vitro, both the glycolytic ability and the viability of PCa cells were inhibited by FV-429. We found that FV-429 could induce mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis, with AKT-HK2 signaling pathway playing a key role. In addition, FV-429 had a pro-apoptotic effect on human prostate cancer cells that relied on the inhibition of AR expression and activity. In vivo, FV-429 exerted significant tumor-repressing activity with high safety in the xenograft model using LNCaP cells.

It is currently insufficiently understood how the dose and biodistribution of 131I relates to salivary gland toxicity, and whether this is consistent for all salivary glands within a single patient. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) was recently introduced as a new tool to evaluate the relative loss of vital acinar cells in individual salivary glands. We aimed to assess gland-specific salivary gland toxicity after 131I-therapy using PSMA PET/CT.  Methods:   Five patients with differentiated thyroid cancer underwent [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT to evaluate their eligibility for peptide radioligand therapy with [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617. Uptake patterns in salivary glands were evaluated visually and quantitatively as an indicator of vital acinar cell loss after prior 131I-therapy.  Results:   Four of 5 patients demonstrated significant lowered uptake in at least one salivary gland, after receiving at least 2 131I-treatments. Asymmetric loss of vital acinar cells occurred by gland type (parotid/submandibular) and location (right/left). The other salivary glands in these patients and all salivary glands in the fifth patient showed normal uptake, demonstrating high intrapatient and interpatient variability.  Conclusions: 131I-therapy can induce salivary gland toxicity with high inter- but also high intrapatient variation among separate gland locations, which can be assessed with PSMA PET/CT. This new technique offers potential to guide further development and evaluation of protective measures in patients receiving 131I-therapy.""","""['Vineet Mohan', 'Wouter V Vogel', 'Gerlof D Valk', 'Jan P de Boer', 'Marnix G E H Lam', 'Bart de Keizer']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Imaging""","""['The value of 68\xa0Ga-PSMA-11 positron emission tomography/computerized tomography in evaluating the lacrimal and salivary glands function.', 'Potential Applications of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in the Evaluation of Salivary Gland Uptake Function: Preliminary Observations and Comparison with 99mTcO4 - Salivary Gland Scintigraphy.', 'Physiologic distribution of PSMA-ligand in salivary glands and seromucous glands of the head and neck on PET/CT.', 'The salivary glands as a dose limiting organ of PSMA- targeted radionuclide therapy: A review of the lessons learnt so far.', 'RadioLigand Therapy with 177LuLu-PSMA-617 for Salivary Gland Cancers: Literature Review and First Compassionate Use in France.', 'Assessment of salivary gland function after 177Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy: Current concepts in imaging and management.']"""

Methods and materials:   A PROM survey was administered to a cohort of SRT patients matched to a reference group with median follow-up 10 years after surgery. In total, 740 patients were analyzed.

Results:   RRs ranged from of 1.7-6.5 on rectal symptoms and 1.2-1.4 for urinary symptoms. In general health, QoL and sexual function all RRs were below 1.1. With increasing age, higher RRs were seen for urinary leakage and lowered sexual function whereas longer time following irradiation showed higher RRs for rectal symptoms and rectal leakage. Limitations of this study include the cross-sectional design and lack of baseline assessment.  Conclusions:   Adding SRT to RP does not seem to result in other than acceptable side-effects in the majority of men receiving SRT when taking a long follow-up time (median 10 years after surgery) into account.

The aim of the current study is to evaluate the chemopreventive potential of grape powder (GP) supplemented diets in genetically predisposed and obesity-provoked prostate cancer.  Methods and results:   Prostate-specific Pten heterozygous (Pten+/f ) transgenic mice are fed low- and high-fat diet (LFD and HFD, respectively) supplemented with 10% GP for 33 weeks, ad libitum. Prostate tissues are characterized using immunohistochemistry and western blots, and sera are analyzed by ELISA and qRT-PCR. Pten+/f mice fed LFD and HFD supplemented with 10% GP show favorable histopathology, significant reduction of the proliferative rate of prostate epithelial cells (Ki67), and rescue of PTEN expression. The most potent protective effect of GP supplementation is detected against HFD-induced increase in inflammation (IL-1β; TGF-β1), activation of cell survival pathways (Akt, AR), and angiogenesis (CD31) in Pten+/f mice. Moreover, GP supplementation reduces circulating levels of oncogenic microRNAs (miR-34a; miR-22) in Pten+/f mice. There are no significant changes in body weight and food intake in GP supplemented diet groups.  Conclusions:   GP diet supplementation can be a beneficial chemopreventive strategy for obesity-related inflammation and prostate cancer progression.

Constitutively active androgen receptor confers anti-androgen resistance in advanced prostate cancer. However, the role of KDM4B in resistance to next-generation anti-androgens and the mechanisms of KDM4B regulation are poorly defined. Here we found that KDM4B is overexpressed in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells. Overexpression of KDM4B promoted recruitment of AR to the c-Myc (MYC) gene enhancer and induced H3K9 demethylation, increasing AR-dependent transcription of c-Myc mRNA, which regulates the sensitivity to next-generation AR-targeted therapy. Inhibition of KDM4B significantly inhibited prostate tumor cell growth in xenografts, and improved enzalutamide treatments through suppression of c-Myc. Clinically, KDM4B expression was found upregulated and to correlate with prostate cancer progression and poor prognosis. Our results revealed a novel mechanism of anti-androgen resistance via histone demethylase alteration which could be targeted through inhibition of KDM4B to reduce AR-dependent c-Myc expression and overcome resistance to AR-targeted therapies. © 2020 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

A panel of PCa experts in nuclear medicine, radiology, and/or urology met on February 21, 2020, in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, to formulate criteria for PSMA PET/CT-based response in patients treated for metastatic PCa and optimal timing to use it.  Methods:   Panelists received thematic topics and relevant literature prior to the meeting. Statements on how to interpret response and progression on therapy in PCa with PSMA PET/CT and when to use it were developed. Panelists voted anonymously on a nine-point scale, ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (9). Median scores described agreement and consensus.  Results:   PSMA PET/CT consensus statements concerned utility, best timing for performing, criteria for evaluation of response, patients who could benefit, and handling of radiolabeled PSMA PET tracers. Consensus was reached on all statements. PSMA PET/CT can be used before and after any local and systemic treatment in patients with metastatic disease to evaluate response to treatment. Ideally, PSMA PET/CT imaging criteria should categorize patients as responders, patients with stable disease, partial response, and complete response, or as non-responders. Specific clinical scenarios such as oligometastatic or polymetastatic disease deserve special consideration.

Materials and methods:   In November 2019, every male employee of the UKF with a minimum age of 45 yrs (or 40 yrs with a first degree relative with prostate cancer) was offered a free prostate cancer checkup. This checkup contained digital rectal examination (DRE), transrectal ultrasound and PSA (prostata-specific antigen) testing.  Results:   Overall, 121/840 employees (14.4%) participated in the Movember campaign. A first degree relative with prostate cancer was reported in overall by 14% of the participants (n = 17). At least one prior prostate cancer check up had 33%. A total of 2.5% (n = 3) had one prior negative prostate biopsy. Median age was 54 yrs (interquartile range 50-58). Median PSA level was 0.9 ng/ml and median free-PSA 0.3 ng/ml. A suspicious DRE was found in 5% (n = 6). After stratification according to age (≤ 50 yrs vs. > 50 yrs), participants over 50 yrs had a significantly higher PSA level (1.0 ng/ml vs. 0.7 ng/ml, p < 0.01) and had more frequently at least one prior prostate cancer checkup in the past (42.0 vs. 12.1%, p < 0.01).

Results:   At the time of MDT, 59 patients (33.5%) had synchronous and 117 patients (66.5%) had metachronous metastases. Median number of metastases was one and the MDT technique was SBRT in 73.3% patients. The 2‑year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 87.6% and 63.1%, respectively.

A published report showed that men with prostate cancer who were resistant to the second-generation androgen receptor inhibitor enzalutamide had increased programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on circulating antigen-presenting cells. We hypothesized that the addition of PD-1 inhibition in these patients could induce a meaningful cancer response.  Methods:   We evaluated enzalutamide plus the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab in a single-arm phase II study of 28 men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mprogressing on enzalutamide alone. Pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenous was given every 3 weeks for four doses with enzalutamide. The primary endpoint was prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline of ≥50%. Secondary endpoints were objective response, PSA progression-free survival (PFS), time to subsequent treatment, and time to death. Baseline tumor biopsies were obtained when feasible, and samples were sequenced and evaluated for the expression of PD-L1, microsatellite instability (MSI), mutational and neoepitope burdens.  Results:   Five (18%) of 28 patients had a PSA decline of ≥50%. Three (25%) of 12 patients with measurable disease at baseline achieved an objective response. Of the five responders, two continue with PSA and radiographic response after 39.3 and 37.8 months.

Histone deacetylase (HDACs) are controlled by tumor suppressor gene transcription and are overexpressed in various tumors, resulting in tumor development, progression and poor prognosis. This study aims to demonstrate the effect of GA on inhibition of prostate cancer (PCa) progression by modulating the expression of HDAC1 and 2 in PCa cells. To prove our research rationale, we used diverse experimental methods. GA decreased the cell viability of only PCa cell lines and not normal cells (contrary to another HDAC inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid) and also inhibited colony and tumor spheroid formation. Exposure to GA decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), increased the number of apoptotic cells and induced DNA fragmentation. Western blot analysis revealed down-regulated expression of HDAC1 and 2, leading to up-regulation of acetyl-p53 expression at the protein level, subsequent to down-regulating the expression of cell-cycle-related genes, i.e., proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), Cyclin D1 and E1, up-regulating the expression of cell cycle arrest gene p21 and regulating the expression of apoptosis intrinsic pathway-related genes, such as Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved Caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 in both PCa cell lines. Furthermore, oral administration of GA for 8 weeks on PC-3 cells-derived tumor xenograft mice model decreases the tumor size, damages the tumor structure and down-regulates the expression of HDAC1 and 2 and PCNA in tumor mass, as confirmed by histological analysis. These results indicated that GA may hinder the PCa progression by inhibiting HDAC1 and 2 expression, thereby demonstrating the potential of GA to be used as HDACs inhibitor and anti-PCa therapeutics.""","""['Yin-Gi Jang', 'Eul-Bee Ko', 'Kyung-Chul Choi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Nutr Biochem""","""['Rosmarinic Acid, a Component of Rosemary Tea, Induced the Cell Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis through Modulation of HDAC2 Expression in Prostate Cancer Cell Lines.', 'A novel histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor MHY219\xa0induces apoptosis via up-regulation of androgen receptor expression in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Inhibition of class IIa histone deacetylase activity by gallic acid, sulforaphane, TMP269, and panobinostat.', 'Recent Progress in Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) 1 Inhibitors as Anticancer Agent.', 'Targeting histone deacetylases: development of vorinostat for the treatment of cancer.', 'Trapa bispinosa Roxb.

The implication is that proof of safety and efficacy in Africans is lacking for a lot of new therapies. The sizeable proportion of approximately 20% of the global population that Africa represents largely does not have empiric data to support use of new therapies in a population with a distinct genetic and racial profile. Beyond the imperative of evidence-based interventions, Africans carry a disproportionately heavy burden of certain diseases, including prostate cancer, sickle cell anemia, and malaria. It therefore provides opportunity for efficient recruitment of participants for trials for such diseases. However, this advantage has not convinced sponsors to carry out clinical trials in Africa. India and China each have roughly the same population size as Africa, but each presents just one regulatory jurisdiction for clinical trials. Africa has 54 countries, and a sponsor would theoretically need to file 54 different applications to cover the entire continent. Collaboration and partnership among all stakeholders in the clinical trial ecosystem will reduce the burden on sponsors and make Africa competitive as a destination for clinical trials. Collaboration among national regulatory agencies will enable Africa to be treated as one regulatory jurisdiction and reduce administrative burden. Sites and researchers can partner to improve quality, attain necessary certifications, and increase overall efficiency.

Despite Africa's growing cancer burden, individuals of African descent, notably those residing in Africa, remain drastically under-represented in cancer clinical trials. Two recent summits-the 1st All Africa Clinical Trial Summit and the Operational Strategy for Clinical Trials in Nigeria Summit-convened experts from governments, the private sector, universities, and professional societies to define the barriers to Africa's participation in multicenter clinical studies and the strategies to eliminate those impedances.  Methods:   The discussions held during the two clinical trial summits were condensed into a set of 10 recommendations covering five broad categories (funding, regulation, capacity building, Africa-centric approach, and patient engagement). In this article, four programs are presented as examples of how the summits' recommendations can be put into practice to improve Africa's ability to attract clinical trials, in particular, cancer clinical trials.  Results:   These example programs all leveraged a multilateral, Africa-driven approach to building Africa's clinical trial capacity, increasing visibility of Africa's current clinical trial capabilities and priorities, improving regulatory infrastructure and enforcement on the continent, and optimizing patient and clinician engagement strategies.  Conclusion:   The four programs are anticipated to catalyze the involvement of more African health care sites in cancer clinical trials, enroll a greater number of African patients with cancer in those trials, and, ultimately, reverse Africa's growing cancer incidence and mortality rates. Each program acts as a blueprint for organizations-whether government, academic, or industry-seeking to address the summits' recommendations and increase Africa's contributions to and active participation in clinical research.""","""['Katy M Graef', 'Ifeoma Okoye', 'Naomi O Ohene Oti', 'Jennifer Dent', 'Folakemi T Odedina']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""JCO Glob Oncol""","""['Building Sustainable Local Capacity for Global Health Research in West Africa.', '""Harnessing genomics to improve health in Africa"" - an executive course to support genomics policy.', ""Africa's neglected area of human resources for health research - the way forward."", 'The need for Africa to develop capacity for vaccinology as a means of curbing antimicrobial resistance.', ""Strengthening Africa's capacity for vaccine research: Needs and challenges."", 'Program management challenges of clinical studies: A qualitative critical assessment.', 'Delays in seeking, reaching and access to quality cancer care in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review.', 'Region-specific laboratory reference intervals are important: A systematic review of the data from Africa.', 'Unmet Needs in Oncology Clinical Research and Treatment in Africa: Focus on Ghana.', 'Action for Increasing Diversity, Market Access, and Capacity in Oncology Registration Trials-Is Africa the Answer?

Bispecific antibodies (BAbs), as the name suggests, have two different antigen-binding domains in a single molecule and thus have dual functionality/specificity combined in a single antibody. In addition to the detection of two different antigenic molecules, the dual functionality of BAbs can be utilized to mount T-cell-mediated killing of tumor cells wherein one Fv binds to the tumor-specific antigen and the another recruits T cells to the site of action. Breast cancer and prostate cancer are among the most prevalent cancers in women and men, respectively. Biomarkers such as HER2 and ER/PR are expressed in breast cancer, while overexpression of hepsin and prostate-specific membrane antigen is observed in prostate cancer. Developing BAbs against these biomarkers may be a potent therapeutic option to target breast and prostate cancer, respectively.

Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the molecular mechanisms that were affected by arbutin as an antioxidant on prostate cancer cell line; LNCap. The intracellular ROS measurement confirmed that arbutin significantly (p < .05) decreased the ROS levels in a dose-dependent manner. Detection of cell death profile established that 1,000 μM of arbutin could remarkably induced apoptosis (p < .05), while tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP) as ROS inducer prompted necrosis. In addition, 1,000 µM of arbutin successfully decreased expressions of IL-1β and TNF-α genes (p < .05). Furthermore, evaluation of the IL-1β protein level showed that arbutin could significantly decrease this cytokine (p < .05). In summary, reduction of ROS along with increasing apoptosis and decreasing expression of pro-inflammatory genes following arbutin treatment can open new visions in the treatment of prostate cancer using complementary medicine. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Nowadays, arbutin as a glycosylated hydroquinone is available commercially in both natural and synthetic forms. Arbutin is of interest because of its skin-lightening effect, and used in cosmetic products for cutaneous hyperpigmentation. Arbutin inhibited tyrosinase in melanocytes competitively. Moreover, arbutin was able to attenuate oxidative stress and, its anti-inflammatory activities has been established. In addition, arbutin has represented useful activities for suppression of malignant melanoma development. In addition, arbutin exhibits several pharmacological effects, including antimicrobial, antihyperlipidemic, antihyperglycemic, and alpha amylase inhibitory effects. In this study, we showed its effect on prostate cancer in vitro.

Design, setting, and participants:   Retrospective cohort study of 6902 men, including 3651 BRCA1 and 3251 BRCA2 PV carriers, older than 18 years recruited from cancer genetics clinics from 1966 to 2017 by 53 study groups in 33 countries worldwide collaborating through the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 (CIMBA). Clinical data and pathologic characteristics were collected.  Main outcomes and measures:   BRCA1/2 status was the outcome in a logistic regression, and cancer diagnoses were the independent predictors. All odds ratios (ORs) were adjusted for age, country of origin, and calendar year of the first interview.  Results:   Among the 6902 men in the study (median [range] age, 51.6 [18-100] years), 1634 cancers were diagnosed in 1376 men (19.9%), the majority (922 of 1,376 [67%]) being BRCA2 PV carriers. Being affected by any cancer was associated with a higher probability of being a BRCA2, rather than a BRCA1, PV carrier (OR, 3.23; 95% CI, 2.81-3.70; P < .001), as well as developing 2 (OR, 7.97; 95% CI, 5.47-11.60; P < .001) and 3 (OR, 19.60; 95% CI, 4.64-82.89; P < .001) primary tumors. A higher frequency of breast (OR, 5.47; 95% CI, 4.06-7.37; P < .001) and prostate (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.09-1.78; P = .008) cancers was associated with a higher probability of being a BRCA2 PV carrier. Among cancers other than breast and prostate, pancreatic cancer was associated with a higher probability (OR, 3.00; 95% CI, 1.55-5.81; P = .001) and colorectal cancer with a lower probability (OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.29-0.78; P = .003) of being a BRCA2 PV carrier.  Conclusions and relevance:   Significant differences in the cancer spectrum were observed in male BRCA2, compared with BRCA1, PV carriers. These data may inform future recommendations for surveillance of BRCA1/2-associated cancers and guide future prospective studies for estimating cancer risks in men with BRCA1/2 PVs.""","""['Valentina Silvestri', 'Goska Leslie', 'Daniel R Barnes;CIMBA Group;Bjarni A Agnarsson', 'Kristiina Aittomäki', 'Elisa Alducci', 'Irene L Andrulis', 'Rosa B Barkardottir', 'Alicia Barroso', 'Daniel Barrowdale', 'Javier Benitez', 'Bernardo Bonanni', 'Ake Borg', 'Saundra S Buys', 'Trinidad Caldés', 'Maria A Caligo', 'Carlo Capalbo', 'Ian Campbell', 'Wendy K Chung', 'Kathleen B M Claes', 'Sarah V Colonna', 'Laura Cortesi', 'Fergus J Couch', 'Miguel de la Hoya', 'Orland Diez', 'Yuan Chun Ding', 'Susan Domchek', 'Douglas F Easton', 'Bent Ejlertsen', 'Christoph Engel', 'D Gareth Evans', 'Lidia Feliubadalò', 'Lenka Foretova', 'Florentia Fostira', 'Lajos Géczi', 'Anne-Marie Gerdes', 'Gord Glendon', 'Andrew K Godwin', 'David E Goldgar', 'Eric Hahnen', 'Frans B L Hogervorst', 'John L Hopper', 'Peter J Hulick', 'Claudine Isaacs', 'Angel Izquierdo', 'Paul A James', 'Ramunas Janavicius', 'Uffe Birk Jensen', 'Esther M John', 'Vijai Joseph', 'Irene Konstantopoulou', 'Allison W Kurian', 'Ava Kwong', 'Elisabetta Landucci', 'Fabienne Lesueur', 'Jennifer T Loud', 'Eva Machackova', 'Phuong L Mai', 'Keivan Majidzadeh-A', 'Siranoush Manoukian', 'Marco Montagna', 'Lidia Moserle', 'Anna Marie Mulligan', 'Katherine L Nathanson', 'Heli Nevanlinna', 'Joanne Ngeow', 'Liene Nikitina-Zake', 'Kenneth Offit', 'Edith Olah', 'Olufunmilayo I Olopade', 'Ana Osorio', 'Laura Papi', 'Sue K Park', 'Inge Sokilde Pedersen', 'Pedro Perez-Segura', 'Annabeth H Petersen', 'Pedro Pinto', 'Berardino Porfirio', 'Miquel Angel Pujana', 'Paolo Radice', 'Johanna Rantala', 'Muhammad U Rashid', 'Barak Rosenzweig', 'Maria Rossing', 'Marta Santamariña', 'Rita K Schmutzler', 'Leigha Senter', 'Jacques Simard', 'Christian F Singer', 'Angela R Solano', 'Melissa C Southey', 'Linda Steele', 'Zoe Steinsnyder', 'Dominique Stoppa-Lyonnet', 'Yen Yen Tan', 'Manuel R Teixeira', 'Soo H Teo', 'Mary Beth Terry', 'Mads Thomassen', 'Amanda E Toland', 'Sara Torres-Esquius', 'Nadine Tung', 'Christi J van Asperen', 'Ana Vega', 'Alessandra Viel', 'Jeroen Vierstraete', 'Barbara Wappenschmidt', 'Jeffrey N Weitzel', 'Greet Wieme', 'Sook-Yee Yoon', 'Kristin K Zorn', 'Lesley McGuffog', 'Michael T Parsons', 'Ute Hamann', 'Mark H Greene', 'Judy A Kirk', 'Susan L Neuhausen', 'Timothy R Rebbeck', 'Marc Tischkowitz', 'Georgia Chenevix-Trench', 'Antonis C Antoniou', 'Eitan Friedman', 'Laura Ottini']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""JAMA Oncol""","""['Error in Author Name.', 'Association of a Polygenic Risk Score With Breast Cancer Among Women Carriers of High- and Moderate-Risk Breast Cancer Genes.', 'Cancer Risks Associated With BRCA1 and BRCA2 Pathogenic Variants.', 'Contralateral Breast Cancer Risk Among Carriers of Germline Pathogenic Variants in ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, and PALB2.', 'Breast and Prostate Cancer Risks for Male BRCA1 and BRCA2 Pathogenic Variant Carriers Using Polygenic Risk Scores.', 'Overall Survival and Clinical Characteristics of BRCA-Associated Cholangiocarcinoma: A Multicenter Retrospective Study.', 'A comprehensive study on surveillance outcomes of a male population followed at a hereditary breast cancer high-risk consultation at a Portuguese tertiary hospital.', 'Hereditary cancer syndromes.', 'Cancer risk in relatives of BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant carriers in a large series of unselected patients with breast cancer.', 'Molecular characteristics of Asian male BRCA-related cancers.', 'Functions of Breast Cancer Predisposition Genes: Implications for Clinical Management.']"""

Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) has been associated with the risk and prognosis of several cancers, but its association with prostate cancer (PCa) prognosis in African Americans (AAs) has not been reported. In this study, we measured relative LTL from 317 AA PCa patients and assessed its associations with aggressive disease characteristics at diagnosis and biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy. LTL was shorter in patients with higher Gleason scores (GS) at diagnosis. Dichotomized into short and long LTL groups, patients with short LTL exhibited a 1.91-fold (95% confidence interval, CI, 1.14-3.20, P = 0.013) increased risk of being diagnosed with high-risk disease (GS =7 [4 + 3] and GS ≥8) than those with long LTL in multivariable logistic regression analysis. Moreover, shorter LTL was significantly associated with an increased risk of BCR (hazard ratio = 1.68, 95% CI, 1.18-11.44, P = 0.024) compared with longer LTL in localized patients receiving prostatectomy or radiotherapy in multivariable Cox analysis. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed patients with short LTL had significantly shorter BCR-free survival time than patients with long LTL (Log rank P = 0.011).

However, followup of men after a negative magnetic resonance imaging guided biopsy has been mostly by prostate specific antigen testing and reports of followup tissue confirmation are few. We investigated the incidence of clinically significant prostate cancer in such men who, because of persistent cancer suspicion, subsequently underwent a repeat magnetic resonance imaging guided biopsy.  Materials and methods:   Subjects were all men with a negative initial magnetic resonance imaging guided biopsy who underwent at least 1 further magnetic resonance imaging guided biopsy due to continued clinical suspicion of clinically significant prostate cancer (September 2009 to July 2019). Biopsies were magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion with targeted and systematic cores. Regions of interest from initial magnetic resonance imaging and any new regions of interest at followup magnetic resonance imaging guided biopsy were targeted. The primary end point was detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (Gleason Grade Group 2 or greater).  Results:   Of 2,716 men 733 had a negative initial magnetic resonance imaging guided biopsy. Study subjects were 73/733 who underwent followup magnetic resonance imaging guided biopsy. Median (IQR) age and prostate specific antigen density were 64 years (59-67) and 0.12 ng/ml/cc (0.08-0.17), respectively. Baseline PI-RADS® scores were 3 or greater in 74%. At followup magnetic resonance imaging guided biopsy (median 2.4 years, IQR 1.3-3.6), 17/73 (23%) were diagnosed with clinically significant prostate cancer. When followup magnetic resonance imaging revealed a lesion (PI-RADS 3 or greater), clinically significant prostate cancer was found in 17/53 (32%). When followup magnetic resonance imaging was negative (PI-RADS less than 3), cancer was not found (0/20) (p <0.01). Overall 54% of men with PI-RADS 5 at followup magnetic resonance imaging guided biopsy were found to have clinically significant prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Men with negative magnetic resonance imaging following an initial negative magnetic resonance imaging guided biopsy are unlikely to harbor clinically significant prostate cancer and may avoid repeat biopsy. However, when lesions are seen on followup magnetic resonance imaging, repeat magnetic resonance imaging guided biopsy is warranted.""","""['Adam Kinnaird', 'Vidit Sharma', 'Ryan Chuang', 'Alan Priester', 'Elizabeth Tran', 'Danielle E Barsa', 'Merdie Delfin', 'Lorna Kwan', 'Anthony Sisk', 'Ely Felker', 'Leonard S Marks']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['How Many Targeted Biopsy Cores are Needed for Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Detection during Transperineal Magnetic Resonance Imaging Ultrasound Fusion Biopsy?', 'Multicentre evaluation of targeted and systematic biopsies using magnetic resonance and ultrasound image-fusion guided transperineal prostate biopsy in patients with a previous negative biopsy.', 'Optimizing the Number of Cores Targeted During Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging Fusion Target Biopsy.', 'Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeted Biopsy in Patients with a Prior Negative Biopsy: A Consensus Statement by AUA and SAR.', 'Targeted and Systematic Prostate Biopsy in Biopsy-naive Men With Positive Multiparameter Magnetic Resonance Imaging Findings: A Meta-analysis.', 'Detection Rate of Prostate Cancer in Repeat Biopsy after an Initial Negative Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Ultrasound-Guided Biopsy.', 'A prospective study of cancer detection rates following early repeat imaging and biopsy of PI-RADS 4 and 5 regions of interest exhibiting no clinically significant prostate cancer on prior biopsy.', 'Detection of clinically significant prostate cancer by micro-ultrasound-informed systematic biopsy during MRI/micro-ultrasound fusion biopsy.', 'Axumin (18F-Fluciclovine) PET imaging in men exhibiting no clinically significant cancer on initial negative biopsy of PI-RADS 4 and 5 regions of interest.', 'Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging for the diagnosis of parotid gland malignancies: systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

The functional microRNAs in the exosomes of plasma and serum samples are of interest as stable and non-invasive biomarkers for recurrence in cancer patients. The present study aimed to clarify the value of plasma exosomal miRNA-125a-5p and miR-141-5p as biomarkers for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. The study included 19 healthy individuals and 31 prostate cancer patients. In comparison to the levels in healthy controls, exosomal miR-141-5p levels showed a slight increase in prostate cancer patients (p=0.085), and miR-125a-5p levels that showed a significant decrease in patients with prostate cancer than in healthy controls (p=0.032). As a derived parameter, the miR-125a-5p/miR-141-5p ratio was significantly higher in patients with prostate cancer than in healthy controls (p<0.001). We found that exosomal miR-141-5p in plasma showed a promise in distinguishing prostate cancer patients with the AUC of 0.652, and for miR-125a-5p, the AUC was 0.691. For the miR-125a-5p/miR-141-5p ratio, the AUC value was 0.793. We found that miR-125a-5p has a weak positive correlation with PSA (correlation coefficient = 0.3413). Moreover, miR-141-5p has been found to hold a negatively no-significant correlation with PSA, with the correlation coefficient is -0.1102. We speculate that, as diagnostic markers for prostate cancer, miR-125-5p and miR-141-5p might be independent of the PSA. In summary, the results of this study suggest that high plasma exosomal expression of miR-141-3p and low expression of miR-125a-5p in plasma exosomes from prostate cancer patients might be useful markers of specific tumor traits associated with prostate cancer. Moreover, the miR-125a-5p/miR-141-5p ratio seems to perform better than either of the single values alone.""","""['W Li', 'Y Dong', 'K J Wang', 'Z Deng', 'W Zhang', 'H F Shen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Neoplasma""","""['Circulating exosomal miR-125a-5p as a novel biomarker for cervical cancer.', 'Circulating exosomal miR-125a-3p as a novel biomarker for early-stage colon cancer.', 'RNA-Seq Identifies Circulating miR-125a-5p, miR-125b-5p, and miR-143-3p as Potential Biomarkers for Acute Ischemic Stroke.', 'Assessment of miR-98-5p, miR-152-3p, miR-326 and miR-4289 Expression as Biomarker for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Diagnostic and Prognostic Performance of Liquid Biopsy-Derived Exosomal MicroRNAs in Thyroid Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Role of microRNA carried by small extracellular vesicles in urological tumors.', 'Liquid Biopsy in Diagnosis and Prognosis of Non-Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', ""Exosomes─Nature's Lipid Nanoparticles, a Rising Star in Drug Delivery and Diagnostics."", 'The role of miR-200 family in the regulation of hallmarks of cancer.', 'The potential of cell-free and exosomal microRNAs as biomarkers in liquid biopsy in patients with prostate cancer.']"""

This study aimed to quantify prostate oedema immediately following FM insertion compared to prostate volumes measured a week later, at the time of simulation for radiation therapy.  Methods:   Thirty patients underwent a verification computed tomography (VCT) scan in treatment position immediately after the fiducial insertion and their planning computed tomography scan (PCT) one week after. Patient data sets were retrospectively evaluated, comparing prostate volumes and planning target volumes (PTV). Volumes were delineated by a single radiation oncologist, blinded to whether the scan was VCT or PCT. Distances between the FMs were measured on both scans. Descriptive statistics described the data, DICE similarity co-efficient (DSC) calculated, and paired t-tests were used to compare paired data.  Results:   The median prostate volume was 35.09 cc and 36.31 cc for VCT and PCT data sets, respectively, and median PTV was 118.56 cc and 127.04 cc for VCT and PCT, respectively. There was no significant difference in prostate volumes (P = 0.3037) or PTV (P = 0.1279), with a DSC of 0.87 (range 0.76-0.91) and 0.91 (range 0.85 to 0.95), respectively. Similarly, there was no significant difference in distance between fiducial markers (P > 0.05).  Conclusion:   This study demonstrates no statistically significant difference in prostate or PTV volumes (P > 0.05) between the CT acquired at fiducial marker insertion compared with the CT acquired a week later.

The ability of bpMRI to detect clinically significant prostate cancer (csPC) with the Prostate Imaging and Reporting Data System version 2.1 (PI-RADS v2.1) compared to standard mpMRI has not been studied extensively.  Purpose:   To compare the interobserver reliability and diagnostic performance for detecting csPC of bpMRI and mpMRI using PI-RADS v2.1.  Study type:   Retrospective.  Population:   In all, 103 patients with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels who underwent mpMRI and subsequent MRI-ultrasonography fusion-guided prostate-targeted biopsy (MRGB) with or without prostatectomy.  Field strength/sequences:   T2 -weighted imaging (T2 WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and DCE-MRI at 3T.  Assessment:   Three readers independently assessed each suspected PC lesion, assigning a score of 1-5 for T2 WI, a score of 1-5 for DWI, and positive and negative for DCE-MRI according to PI-RADS v2.1 and determined the overall PI-RADS assessment category of bpMRI (T2 WI and DWI) and mpMRI (T2 WI, DWI, and DCE-MRI). The reference standard was MRGB or prostatectomy-derived histopathology.  Statistical testing:   Statistical analysis was performed using the kappa statistic and McNemar and Delong tests.  Results:   Of the 165 suspected PC lesions in 103 patients, 81 were diagnosed with csPC and 84 with benign conditions. Interobserver variability of PI-RADS assessment category showed good agreement for bpMRI (kappa value = 0.642) and mpMRI (kappa value = 0.644). For three readers, the diagnostic sensitivity was significantly higher for mpMRI than for bpMRI (P < 0.001 to P = 0.016, respectively), whereas diagnostic specificity was significantly higher for bpMRI than for mpMRI (P < 0.001 each). For three readers, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was higher for bpMRI than for mpMRI; however, the difference was significant only for Reader 1 and Reader 3 (Reader 1: 0.823 vs. 0.785, P = 0.035; Reader 2: 0.852 vs. 0.829, P = 0.099; and Reader 3: 0.828 vs. 0.773, P = 0.002).

We developed the TrueNTH Peer Navigation Training Program (PNTP), a competency-based, blended online/in-person course. In this study, we evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of the PNTP among prostate cancer (PC) survivors (patients, caregivers).  Methods:   We employed an explanatory mixed method study design consisting of course usage data, pre-/post-questionnaires, and focus groups informed by the Kirkpatrick framework and self-efficacy theory.  Results:   Three cohorts in two Canadian cities (n = 26) received the PNTP. Participants were motivated to support others like themselves (n = 20), fill a gap (n = 7), pay it forward (n = 6), and offer expertise (n = 4). Recruitment, retention, and questionnaire completion were 96.7%, 89.6%, and 92%. Participants contributed a total of 426 posts to the online forums (2 to 3 posts per participant/module). Satisfaction was 9.4/10 (SD = 0.7) and usability was 84.5/100 (SD = 10.1). All learning outcomes increased: understanding of learning objectives t(23) = - 6.12, p < 0.0001; self-efficacy to perform competencies t(23) = - 4.8, p < 0.0001; and eHealth literacy t(23) = - 4.4, p < 0.0001. Participants viewed the PTNP as intensive but manageable, improving knowledge and confidence and enhancing listening skills.

Kaplan-Meier, uni- and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted for multiple endpoints: BCR, metastatic-(mPC) and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), prostate cancer-specific (PCSS) and overall survival (OS). Functional effects of the four MiCaP miRNAs were assessed by overexpression and inhibition experiments in prostate cancer cell lines. We found the numerical value 5.709 optimal for MiCaP dichotomisation. This was independently validated in PCA281, where a high MiCaP score significantly [and independent of the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment Postsurgical (CAPRA-S) score] predicted BCR, progression to mPC and CRPC, and PCSS, but not OS. Harrell's C-index increased upon addition of MiCaP to CAPRA-S for all endpoints. Inhibition of miR-23a-3p and miR-10b-5p, and overexpression of miR-133a-3p and miR-374b-5p significantly reduced cell survival.

We recently developed a specific and potent inhibitor targeting this enzyme, and here, we report a synthetic lethality screen using this compound. Our screen identified pan-cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor AT7519 as lethal in combination with OGT inhibition. Follow-up chemical and genetic approaches identified CDK9 as the major target for synthetic lethality with OGT inhibition in prostate cancer cells. OGT expression is regulated through retention of the fourth intron in the gene and CDK9 inhibition blunted this regulatory mechanism. CDK9 phosphorylates carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA Polymerase II to promote transcription elongation. We show that OGT inhibition augments effects of CDK9 inhibitors on CTD phosphorylation and general transcription. Finally, the combined inhibition of both OGT and CDK9 blocked growth of organoids derived from patients with metastatic prostate cancer, but had minimal effects on normal prostate spheroids. We report a novel synthetic lethal interaction between inhibitors of OGT and CDK9 that specifically kills prostate cancer cells, but not normal cells. Our study highlights the potential of combining OGT inhibitors with other treatments to exploit cancer-specific vulnerabilities. IMPLICATIONS: The primary contribution of OGT to cell proliferation is unknown, and in this study, we used a compound screen to indicate that OGT and CDK9 collaborate to sustain a cancer cell-specific pro-proliferative program.

When local recurrence occurs, salvage robot-assisted radical prostatectomy is a treatment option for selected patients, but there is a paucity of data on the peri-operative safety, functional and oncologic outcomes of sRARP.. The objective of this study was therefore to describe peri-operative safety, functional and early oncologic outcomes following salvage robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (sRARP) for local recurrence after HIFU-PA.  Methods:   Retrospective analysis of a prospective database of 53 consecutive men who underwent sRARP after HIFU-PA from 2012 to 2018. Continence and erectile-function were reported pre-HIFU, pre-sRARP, 3-months post-sRARP and 12-months post-sRARP. Complications, PSMs and need for subsequent ADT/radiotherapy were assessed.  Results:   45 men were suitable for inclusion and had sufficient data for analyses. Median duration from HIFU to sRARP was 30.0 months and median follow-up post-sRARP was 17.7 months. Median age, PSA and ISUP group were 63.0 yrs., 7.2 ng/mL and 2; 88.9% were cT2. Median operative-console time, blood loss and hospital stay were 140 min, 200 ml and 1 day respectively. Clavien-Dindo grade 1, 2 and 3 complications < 90 days occurred in 8.9, 6.7 and 2.2%; late (>90d) complications occurred in 13.2%. At sRARP pathology, ISUP 3-5 occurred in 51.1%, pT3a/b in 64.5%, and PSMs in 44.4% (37.5% for pT2, 48.3% for pT3). Of men with > 3-months follow-up after sRARP, 26.3% underwent adjuvant radiotherapy/ADT for residual disease or adverse pathologic features; 5.3% experienced BCR requiring salvage ADT/radiotherapy. Freedom from ADT/radiotherapy was 66.7% at 12-months. Pad-free rates were 100% pre-HIFU, 95.3% post-HIFU, 29.4% 3-months post-sRARP, and 65.5% 12-months post-sRARP. Median IIEF-5 scores pre-HIFU, post-HIFU, 3- and 12-months post-sRARP were 23.5, 16, 5 and 5, respectively. Potency rates were 81.8, 65.5, 0 and 0%, respectively. Bilateral/unilateral nerve sparing were feasible in 7%/22%.  Conclusion:   Salvage RARP was safe with acceptable but sub-optimal continence and poor sexual-function and poor oncologic outcomes. One in three men required additional treatment within 12-months.

Tumor microenvironment is composed of activated fibroblasts, the so called carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). They express high levels of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and type I collagen (COL1), and support proliferation and migration of tumor epithelial cells. Extracorporeal shock waves (ESWs), acoustic waves, are effective in the treatment of hypertrophic scars, due to their ability to modulate fibrosis. Based on this rationale, the study evaluated the effects of ESWs on CAF activation and the influence of ESW-treated CAFs on the growth and migration of epithelial prostatic carcinoma cells.  Methods:   Primary cultures of CAFs (n = 10) were prepared from tumors of patients undergoing surgery for high-risk prostate carcinoma. CAFs were treated with ESWs (energy levels: 0.32 mJ/mm2 , 1000 pulses; 0.59 mJ/mm2 , 250 pulses). After treatment, the messenger RNA and protein levels of the stromal activation markers α-SMA and COL1 were determined. Subsequently, two different stabilized cell lines (PC3 and DU145) of androgen-resistant prostate cancer were treated with the conditioned media produced by ESW-treated CAFs. At different times, viability and migration of PC3 and DU145 cells were evaluated. Viability was also assessed by coculture system using CAFs and PC3 or DU145 cells.  Results:   ESWs reduced gene expression and protein level of α-SMA and COL1 in CAFs. The treatment of PC3 and DU145 with conditioned media of ESW-treated CAFs determined a reduction of their growth and invasive potential. Coculture systems between ESW-treated CAFs and PC3 or DU145 cells confirmed the epithelial cell number reduction.  Conclusions:   This in vitro study demonstrates for the first time that ESWs are able to modulate the activation of prostate CAFs in favor of a less ""reactive"" stroma, with consequent slowing of the growth and migration of prostate cancer epithelial cells. However, only further studies to be performed in vivo will confirm the possibility of using this new therapy in patients with prostate cancer.""","""['Letizia Rinella', 'Benedetta Pizzo', 'Roberto Frairia', 'Luisa Delsedime', 'Giorgio Calleris', 'Paolo Gontero', 'Valentina Zunino', 'Nicoletta Fortunati', 'Emanuela Arvat', 'Maria Graziella Catalano']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Stromal factors involved in human prostate cancer development, progression and castration resistance.', 'Alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive cancer-associated fibroblasts secreting osteopontin promote growth of luminal breast cancer.', 'Phenotypic characterization of human prostatic stromal cells in primary cultures derived from human tissue samples.', 'Regulation of heterogeneous cancer-associated fibroblasts: the molecular pathology of activated signaling pathways.', 'Collagens and Cancer associated fibroblasts in the reactive stroma and its relation to Cancer biology.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblasts promote malignant phenotypes of prostate cancer cells via autophagy : Cancer-associated fibroblasts promote prostate cancer development.', 'Multimodality Characterization of Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts in Tumor Microenvironment and Its Correlation With Ultrasound Shear Wave-Measured Tissue Stiffness in Localized Prostate Cancer.']"""

A systematic drug targeting model (SysDT) was used for compound targets prediction, and then the targets were analyzed for Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of HQ-BS targets was constructed, after identifying core networks through Cytoscape plugins. RESULTS We found 47 bioactive compounds of HQ-BS and 107 human-derived targets. A compound target network and a target signal pathway network were constructed and used for topological analysis. Kaempferol, beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, wogonin, and oroxylin-a were identified as core compounds and pathways in cancer. The calcium signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, chemical carcinogenesis, estrogen signaling pathway, proteoglycans in cancer, HIF-1 signaling pathway, thyroid hormone signaling pathway, VEGF signaling pathway, small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, and T cell receptor signaling pathway were found to be potential signals of HQ-BS in treating cancer. Through PPI network analysis, TNF signaling pathway, tryptophan metabolism, proteoglycans in cancer, cell cycle, and chemical carcinogenesis sub-networks were obtained.

We describe the GI-related patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of patients with anal cancer receiving chemoradiotherapy to improve patient-physician communication.  Methods:   We prospectively followed patients with nonmetastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal who received definitive chemoradiotherapy. Patients completed the bowel subdomain of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaire before treatment and at 4 subsequent timepoints. We used the paired Wilcoxon test to compare EPIC scores at different times.  Results:   The study included 21 patients; median age was 57 years. Most patients (52%) had T2 and either N0 or N1 disease (81%). Most patients (91%) received chemotherapy with cisplatin-fluorouracil and either intensity-modulated radiotherapy or volumetric modulated arc therapy. Compared with the patients' median overall summary score at baseline (66), their median score at 1 week (82) was higher (P = .009), whereas their median score at 5 weeks (54) was lower (P = .025). The patients' median overall summary score at baseline and at 3 months did not differ (P = .919). Three months after radiotherapy, most patients reported minimal adverse effects compared with baseline.  Conclusion:   The GI-related PROs of patients with anal cancer tend to fluctuate during radiotherapy but return to baseline by 3 months, at which time most patients report few or no residual adverse effects.

PI-RADS score threshold of 3 could achieve the highest Yonder index for predicting PCa, and PI-RADS score threshold of 4 could achieve the highest Yonder index for predicting csPCa. Therefore, we draw a conclusion that PI-RADSv2 score-based bpMRI could diminish the unnecessary prostate biopsies in patients with elevated PSA when combined with other PSA-related indicators.""","""['Jun Zhu', 'Zhen Liang', 'Yuxuan Song', 'Yongjiao Yang', 'Yawei Xu', 'Yi Lu', 'Rui Hu', 'Ningjing Ou', 'Wei Zhang', 'Xiaoqiang Liu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Andrologia""","""['Head-to-head comparison of biparametric versus multiparametric MRI of the prostate before robot-assisted transperineal fusion prostate biopsy.', 'MRI combined with PSA density in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer in patients with PSA serum levels of 4∼10ng/mL: Biparametric versus multiparametric MRI.', 'Prebiopsy biparametric MRI: differences of PI-RADS version 2 in patients with different PSA levels.', 'Analysis of risk factors for determining the need for prostate biopsy in patients with negative MRI.', 'Round table: arguments in supporting abbreviated or biparametric MRI of the prostate protocol.', 'Modified Predictive Model and Nomogram by Incorporating Prebiopsy Biparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging With Clinical Indicators for Prostate Biopsy Decision Making.']"""

A total dose of 70 to 81 Gray (Gy) is given daily (1.8-2.5 Gy/d), with a dose rate of 3 to 6 Gy/min over 28 to 45 treatments during 8 to 9 weeks. We applied the latest technological development in linear accelerators for enabling a wide range of dose rates (from 0.2-21 Gy/min) to test the effect of different delivery dose rates on prostate tumor growth in an animal xenograft model.  Materials and methods:   A prostate cancer xenograft model was established in CD1/nude mice by means of PC-3 and CL-1 cells. The animals were radiated by a TrueBeam linear accelerator that delivered 4 dose rates ranging from 0.6 to 14 Gy/min, and reaching a total dose of 20 Gy. The mice were weighed and monitored for tumor development twice weekly. A 2-way analysis of variance was used to compare statistical differences between the groups.  Results:   Tumor growth was inhibited by radiation at all 4 dose rates in the 20 study mice compared to no radiation (n = 5, controls). The most significant reduction in tumor volumes was observed when the same dose of radiation was delivered at a rate of 0.6 Gy/min (P < .01). The animals' weights were not affected by any dose rate.  Conclusions:   Delivery of radiation with a TrueBeam linear accelerator at the lowest possible rate was most effective in prostate cancer growth inhibition and might be considered a preferential treatment mode for localized prostate cancer.""","""['Keren Tazat', 'Oleg Reshetnyak', 'Natan Shtraus', 'Ifat Sayag', 'Nicola J Mabjeesh', 'Sharon Amir']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['Acute genitourinary toxicity after high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: correlation between the urethral dose in HDR brachytherapy and the severity of acute genitourinary toxicity.', 'Sodium selenite radiosensitizes hormone-refractory prostate cancer xenograft tumors but not intestinal crypt cells in vivo.', 'Lateral rectal shielding reduces late rectal morbidity following high dose three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy for clinically localized prostate cancer: further evidence for a significant dose effect.', 'The radiobiology of prostate cancer including new aspects of fractionated radiotherapy.', 'Preliminary toxicity and prostate-specific antigen response of a Phase I/II trial of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, 103Pd brachytherapy, and three-dimensional conformal external beam irradiation in the treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Role of Mitochondria in Radiation Responses: Epigenetic, Metabolic, and Signaling Impacts.']"""

The use of biomarkers in blood and urine could potentially help clinicians select patients for whom biopsies are needed. The aim of the study was to test a new urine and plasma biomarker test in detecting medium and high grade prostate cancer.Materials and methods: Blood and urine samples were prospectively collected from 41 patients prior to prostate biopsy or TUR-P and again after 3 months. The cohort included patients with suspicion of prostate cancer and patients with prior prostate cancer diagnosis. The mRNA expression of ten selected genes measured by PCR were used together with clinical data in multiple algorithms for prediction of medium-high grade prostate cancer in prostate biopsies. The testing was originally developed and validated in the USA. The method was transferred to a local Danish laboratory. Medium and high grade cancer was defined as Gleason score ≥ 3 + 4.Results: Using the biomarker test, prior to any prostate procedures, the sensitivity for detecting medium-high grade prostate cancer was 100% and the specificity was 56% and 63%, depending on the cut-off point used. When using the biomarker test, following biopsy or TUR-P, the sensitivity and specificity were reduced to 89% and 28-34% respectively.

Methods:   We conducted 22 focus groups with 170 adult survivors of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer from six cities across the country and online. We used thematic analysis to identify participants' principles and priorities for quality survivorship care.  Results:   Based on our analysis of a limited group of cancer survivors, we identified two core principles that underlie participants' expectations for survivorship care and 11 practice priorities that reflect opportunities to improve patient-centeredness at the individual, interpersonal, and organizational levels. The principles reflect participants' desire to be better prepared for and equipped to accept and manage their chronic care needs post-cancer treatment. The priorities reflect practices that patients, providers, and cancer centers can engage in to ensure survivors' goals for post-treatment care are met.  Conclusions:   Results from the study suggest the need to expand conceptualization of high-quality survivorship care. The survivor principles and practice priorities identified in this study challenge the field to organize a more patient-centered survivorship care system that empowers and respects patients and provides a holistic approach to survivors' chronic and long-term needs.  Implications for cancer survivors:   Quality cancer survivorship care must reflect patients' priorities.

However, recent circulating miRNA biomarkers either are identified upon small sample sizes or cannot have robust diagnostic performance in every aspect of performance indicators. These may decrease applicability of potential biomarkers for the early detection of PCa. We reviewed recent studies on blood-derived miRNAs for prostate cancer diagnosis and carried out a large case study to understand whether circulating miRNA pairs, rather than single circulating miRNAs, could contribute to a more robust diagnostic model to significantly improve PCa diagnosis. We used 1231 high-throughput miRNA-profiled serum samples from two cohorts to design and verify a model based on class separability miRNA pairs (cs-miRPs). The pairwise model was composed of five circulating miRNAs coupled to miR-5100 and miR-1290 (i.e. five miRNA pairs, 5-cs-miRPs), reaching approximately 99% diagnostic performance in almost all indicators (sensitivity = 98.96%, specificity = 100%, accuracy = 99.17%, PPV = 100%, NPV = 96.15%) shown by a test set (n = 484: PCa = 384, negative prostate biopsies = 100). The nearly 99% diagnostic performance was also verified by an additional validation set (n = 140: PCa = 40, healthy controls = 100). Overall, the 5-cs-miRP model had 1 false positive and 7 false negatives among the 1231 serum samples and was superior to a recent 2-miRNA model (so far the best for PCa diagnosis) with 18 false positives and 80 false negatives.

Methods:   The mechanical oscillation method was used to prepare ICG-loaded photoacoustic NBs (ICG NBs). Then, PSMA-binding peptides were connected to the surface of ICG NBs using the biotin-avidin method to make targeted photoacoustic NBs, namely, PSMAP/ICG NBs. Their particle sizes, zeta potentials, and in vitro ultrasound, photoacoustic and fluorescence imaging were examined. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry were used to detect the binding ability of the PSMAP/ICG NBs to PSMA-positive LNCaP cells, C4-2 cells, and PSMA-negative PC-3 cells. The multimodal imaging effects of PSMAP/ICG NBs and ICG NBs were compared in nude mouse tumor xenografts.  Results:   The particle size of the PSMAP/ICG NBs was approximately 457.7 nm, and the zeta potential was approximately -23.5 mV. Both confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry confirmed that the PSMAP/ICG NBs could specifically bind to both LNCaP and C4-2 cells, but they rarely bound to PC-3 cells. The ultrasound, photoacoustic and fluorescence imaging intensities of the PSMAP/ICG NBs in vitro positively correlated with their concentrations. The ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging effects of the PSMAP/ICG NBs in LNCaP and C4-2 tumor xenografts were significantly enhanced compared with those in PC-3 tumor xenografts, which were characterized by a significantly increased duration of ultrasound enhancement and heightened photoacoustic signal intensity (P < 0.05). Fluorescence imaging showed that PSMAP/ICG NBs could accumulate in LNCaP and C4-2 tumor xenografts for a relatively long period.  Conclusion:   The targeted photoacoustic nanobubbles prepared in this study can specifically bind to PSMA-positive prostate cancer cells and have the ability to enhance ultrasound, photoacoustic and fluorescence imaging of PSMA-positive tumor xenografts. Photoacoustic imaging could visually display the intensity of the red photoacoustic signal in the tumor region, providing a more intuitive imaging modality for targeted molecular imaging.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PHI for prostate cancer detection in Chinese men.  Method:   We developed a Markov model for Chinese male patient aged 50-75 years old. The PSA strategy was to offer TRUS-PB for all patients with elevated PSA of 4-10 ng/mL. The PHI strategy was to offer PHI for patients with elevated PSA of 4-10 ng/mL. TRUS-PB would only be offered for patients with PHI >35.0. Model inputs were extracted from local data when available. The cost per quality-adjusted life years gained for both strategies were calculated. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in relation to the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold were compared. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were also constructed.  Results:   With a Markov model of 25 screening cycles from age 50 to 75 years, the mean total costs per man were estimated to be USD 27,439 in the PSA strategy and USD 22,877 in the PHI strategy. The estimated effects were estimated to be 15.70 in the PSA strategy and 16.05 in the PHI strategy. The PHI strategy was associated with an expected decrease in cost of USD 4562 and an expected gain of 0.35 QALY, resulting in an ICER of USD -13056.56. The results were shown to be robust upon one-way sensitivity analysis. Upon Monte Carlo simulation, the PHI strategy was more cost-effective for 100% of the iterations. The PHI strategy demonstrated dominance over the PSA strategy regardless of what WTP threshold we use.  Conclusions:   A PHI-based screening strategy may be more cost-effective than a PSA-based strategy for prostate cancer detection in Chinese men.

Here we used the The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset to examine 12 tumor types (including colon, breast, prostate, pancreas, lung adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma) for the frequency of codon mutations of 10 Rho-GAP and experimentally tested biochemical and biological consequences for cancer-associated mutants that arose in the DLC1 tumor suppressor gene. DLC1 was the Rho-GAP gene mutated most frequently, with 5%-8% of tumors in five of the tumor types evaluated having DLC1 missense mutations. Furthermore, 20%-26% of the tumors in four of these five tumor types harbored missense mutations in at least one of the 10 Rho-GAPs. Experimental analysis of the DLC1 mutants indicated 7 of 9 mutants whose lesions were located in the Rho-GAP domain were deficient for Rho-GAP activity and for suppressing cell migration and anchorage-independent growth. Analysis of a DLC1 linker region mutant and a START domain mutant showed each was deficient for suppressing migration and growth in agar, but their Rho-GAP activity was similar to that of wild-type DLC1. Compared with the wild-type, the linker region mutant bound 14-3-3 proteins less efficiently, while the START domain mutant displayed reduced binding to Caveolin-1.

RARRES2 is widely expressed in nonhematopoietic tissues and often downregulated across multiple tumor types compared with normal tissue. Recent studies show that augmenting chemerin in the tumor microenvironment significantly suppresses tumor growth, in part, by immune effector cells recruitment. However, as tumor cells express functional chemokine/chemoattractant receptors that impact their phenotype, we hypothesized that chemerin may have additional, tumor-intrinsic effects.  Experimental design:   We investigated the effect of exogenous chemerin on human prostate and sarcoma tumor lines. Key signaling pathway components were elucidated using qPCR, Western blotting, siRNA knockdown, and specific inhibitors. Functional consequences of chemerin treatment were evaluated using in vitro and in vivo studies.  Results:   We show for the first time that human tumors exposed to exogenous chemerin significantly upregulate PTEN expression/activity, and concomitantly suppress programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression. CMKLR1 knockdown abrogated chemerin-induced PTEN and PD-L1 modulation, exposing a novel CMKLR1/PTEN/PD-L1 signaling cascade. Targeted inhibitors suggested signaling was occurring through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Chemerin treatment significantly reduced tumor migration, while significantly increasing T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Chemerin treatment was as effective as both PD-L1 knockdown and the anti-PD-L1 antibody, atezolizumab, in augmenting T-cell-mediated tumor lysis. Forced expression of chemerin in human DU145 tumors significantly suppressed in vivo tumor growth, and significantly increased PTEN and decreased PD-L1 expression.  Conclusions:   Collectively, our data show a novel link between chemerin, PTEN, and PD-L1 in human tumor lines, which may have a role in improving T-cell-mediated immunotherapies.""","""['Keith Rennier', 'Woo Jae Shin', 'Ethan Krug', 'Gurpal Virdi', 'Russell K Pachynski']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Chemerin suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis through CMKLR1-PTEN-Akt axis.', 'Chemerin Suppresses Breast Cancer Growth by Recruiting Immune Effector Cells Into the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'PD-L1 expression in triple-negative breast cancer.', 'YY1 regulates cancer cell immune resistance by modulating PD-L1 expression.', 'Augmenting Anticancer Immunity Through Combined Targeting of Angiogenic and PD-1/PD-L1 Pathways: Challenges and Opportunities.', 'RARRES2 regulates lipid metabolic reprogramming to mediate the development of brain metastasis in triple negative breast cancer.', 'RNA-Seq Analysis of Peripheral Whole Blood from Dairy Bulls with High and Low Antibody-Mediated Immune Responses-A Preliminary Study.', 'Chemerin and Chemokine-like Receptor 1 Expression in Ovarian Cancer Associates with Proteins Involved in Estrogen Signaling.', 'Targeting the chemerin/CMKLR1 axis by small molecule antagonist α-NETA mitigates endometriosis progression.', 'Clinical implications of the interaction between PD-1/PD-L1 and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in progression and treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.']"""

Objective:   To provide updated practical recommendations for the diagnosis and management of PUC.  Evidence acquisition:   A systematic search interrogating Ovid (Medline), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was performed.  Evidence synthesis:   Urothelial carcinoma of the urethra is the predominant histological type of PUC (54-65%), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (16-22%) and adenocarcinoma (10-16%). Diagnosis of PUC depends on urethrocystoscopy with biopsy and urinary cytology. Pathological staging and grading are based on the tumour, node, metastasis (TNM) classification and the 2016 World Health Organization grading systems. Local tumour extent and regional lymph nodes are assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, and the presence of distant metastases is assessed by computed tomography of the thorax/abdomen and pelvis. For all patients with localised distal tumours (≤T2N0M0), partial urethrectomy or urethra-sparing surgery is a valid treatment option, provided that negative intraoperative surgical margins can be achieved. Prostatic Ta-Tis-T1 PUC can be treated with repeat transurethral resection of the prostate and bacillus Calmette-Guérin. In prostatic or proximal ≥ T2N0 disease, neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy should be considered prior to radical surgery. All patients with locally advanced disease (≥T3N0-2M0) should be discussed within a multidisciplinary team. In men with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma, curative radiotherapy combined with radiosensitising chemotherapy can be offered for definitive treatment and genital preservation. In patients with local urethral recurrence, salvage surgery or radiotherapy can be offered. For patients with distant metastatic disease, systemic therapy based on tumour characteristics can be evaluated.  Conclusions:   These updated European Association of Urology guidelines provide up-to-date guidance for the contemporary diagnosis and management of patients with suspected PUC.

Many genomic biomarkers have been developed to predict this clinical behavior, but these are confounded by the extreme spatial heterogeneity of prostate tumors: most are multifocal and harbor multiple subclonal populations. To quantify the influence of spatial heterogeneity on genomic prognostic biomarkers, we developed a case-control high-risk cohort (n = 42) using a prospective registry, risk matched by clinicopathologic prognostic indices. Half of the cohort had early biochemical recurrence (BCR; ie, ≤18 mo), while half remained without evidence of disease for at least 48 mo after radical prostatectomy. We then genomically profiled multiple tumor foci per patient, analyzing 119 total specimens. These data allowed us to validate three published genomic prognostic biomarkers and quantify their sensitivity to tumor spatial heterogeneity. Remarkably, all three biomarkers robustly predicted early BCR, and all three were robust to spatiogenomic variability. These data suggest that DNA-based genomic biomarkers can overcome intratumoral heterogeneity: single biopsies may be sufficient to estimate the risk of early BCR after radical treatment in patients with high-risk disease. PATIENT SUMMARY: We investigated whether heterogeneity between tumor regions within the prostate affects the accuracy of DNA-based biomarkers predicting early relapse after prostatectomy. We observed persistent accuracy in predicting disease relapse, suggesting that spatial heterogeneity may not hinder biomarker performance.""","""['Harry C Brastianos', 'Jure Murgic', 'Adriana Salcedo', 'Melvin L K Chua', 'Alice Meng', 'Michael Fraser', 'Michael Brundage', 'Neil E Fleshner', 'Theodorus van der Kwast', 'Robert G Bristow', 'Paul C Boutros', 'Alejandro Berlin']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['Tumour genomic and microenvironmental heterogeneity for integrated prediction of 5-year biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer: a retrospective cohort study.', 'Translating a Prognostic DNA Genomic Classifier into the Clinic: Retrospective Validation in 563 Localized Prostate Tumors.', 'Genomic Heterogeneity Within Individual Prostate Cancer Foci Impacts Predictive Biomarkers of Targeted Therapy.', 'Tissue-Based MicroRNAs as Predictors of Biochemical Recurrence after Radical Prostatectomy: What Can We Learn from Past Studies?', 'Incorporating Prognostic Biomarkers into Risk Assessment Models and TNM Staging for Prostate Cancer.', 'The combination of prostate MRI PI-RADS scoring system and a genomic classifier is associated with pelvic lymph node metastasis at the time of radical prostatectomy.', 'Radiomics in prostate cancer: an up-to-date review.', 'Tumor microenvironment heterogeneity an important mediator of prostate cancer progression and therapeutic resistance.', 'Prostate Cancer Radiogenomics-From Imaging to Molecular Characterization.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Radiomic Models of Prostate Cancer: A Narrative Review.']"""

Objective:   To investigate the differential impact of GnRH agonists and antagonists on clinical safety and oncologic outcomes.  Evidence acquisition:   This meta-analysis was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A literature search using the electronic databases (MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus) included randomized controlled trials comparing the clinical safety and oncologic outcomes of GnRH agonists and antagonists. The endpoints of interest were the following: (1) treatment-related adverse effects (AEs), (2) prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression, and (3) overall mortality. The relative risk (RR) was used as the summary statistic, and results were reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).  Evidence synthesis:   Eight clinical trials (20 published studies) comprising 2632 men met our inclusion criteria; of them, 1646 received GnRH antagonist and 986 had GnRH agonist. Treatment-emerging AEs occurred in 73% patients in the GnRH antagonist group and 68% in the GnRH agonist group (RR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.04-1.15). Serious AEs occurred in 9.8% of the GnRH antagonist and 11% of the GnRH agonist group (RR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.73-1.17). Antagonists were associated with higher injection site reaction rates (38%) than agonists (4.8%). GnRH antagonist was associated with fewer cardiovascular events (RR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.34-0.80). There was no significant difference in PSA progression, but GnRH antagonist was associated with lower overall mortality rates than GnRH agonists (RR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.26-0.90, p = 0.02).  Conclusions:   Existing data indicate that GnRH antagonist use is associated with significantly lower overall mortality and cardiovascular events as compared with agonists. These findings should be interpreted with caution owing to the short follow-up duration and assessment of cardiovascular events as secondary endpoints in the included trials. Further studies are needed to validate or refute these observations. Injection site reactions were significantly higher in the GnRH antagonist group.  Patient summary:   Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist is associated with lower death rates and cardiovascular events than GnRH agonists, based on the data from trials with short follow-up duration. GnRH agonists are associated with lower adverse events, such as decreased libido, hot flushes, erectile dysfunction, back pain, weight gain, constipation, and injection site reactions.

Three dietary patterns were identified from principal component analysis. Unconditional logistic regression estimated the association between dietary patterns and PCa, adjusting for age, ethnicity, education, family history, and timing of last PCa screening. When comparing scores in the highest vs. lowest quartiles, the Healthy Eating pattern was associated with a decreased risk of overall PCa (Odds ratio (OR) = 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.61, 0.93); this association was stronger for high-grade cancers (OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.48, 0.89).

Though the CHI/HA LbL films cannot be considered as a traditional biosensor due to their limited selectivity, it was possible to distinguish prostate tumor cells in the range from 50 to 600 cells/µL in in vitro experiments with impedance spectroscopy. This was achieved by treating the impedance data with information visualization methods, which confirmed the distinguishing ability of the films by observing the absence of false positives in a series of control experiments.

Methods:   We enrolled 449 patients with breast, prostate, and colon cancer at beginning and end of inpatient rehabilitation. We obtained self-reports about unexpressed needs and health-related variables (quality of life, depression, anxiety, adjustment disorder, and health literacy). We estimated frequencies and conducted correlation and ordinal logistic regression analyses.  Results:   A quarter of patients stated they had ""rather not"" or ""not at all"" expressed all relevant needs. Patients mostly omitted fear of cancer recurrence. Most frequent reasons for not expressing needs were being focused on physical consequences of cancer, concerns emerging only later, and not knowing about the possibility of talking about distress. Not expressing needs was associated with several health-related outcomes, for example, emotional functioning, adjustment disorder, fear of progression, and health literacy. Depression measured at the beginning of rehabilitation showed only small correlations and is therefore not sufficient to identify patients with unexpressed needs.

Aim:   To investigate the level of NANOG mRNA in tumor tissue of patients with PC and to analyze the possibility of its use as a marker of the disease course.  Materials and methods:   The study involved 85 patients with PC of stages II-IV. Morphological and immunohistochemical studies were performed on serial paraffin sections of resected PC using monoclonal antibodies to Ki-67 and androgen receptor. NANOG and miR-214 mRNA expression in tumor cells was analyzed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The identification of CSCs was performed by double-labeled immunohistochemical method using primary antibodies to CD24 and CD44.  Results:   We have revealed notable variability of NANOG mRNA levels in tumor tissue of patients with PC (mean 4.18 ± 0.65 a.u. with individual deviations from 0.11 ± 0.03 a.u. to 15.24 ± 0.36 a.u.). According to NANOG mRNA levels, two groups of the PC patients were delineated: group 1 and group 2, with the average NANOG mRNA levels of 2.12 ± 0.16 a.u., and 8.68 ± 1.24 a.u., respectively. The NANOG mRNA levels in tumor tissue of PC patients of groups 1 and 2 correlated with preoperative serum prostate-specific antigen level (r = 0.58; p < 0.05 and r = 0.64; p < 0.05, respectively), tumor volume (r = 0.42; p < 0.05 and r = 0.72; p < 0.05, respectively), regional lymph node metastases (r = 0.70; p < 0.05 and r = 0.75; p < 0.05, respectively). High NANOG mRNA levels in tumor cells were associated with such molecular and biological features of PC as androgen receptor expression (r = 0.52; p < 0.05), high proliferative activity (r = 0.60; p < 0.05) and the presence of CSC markers (r = 0.75; p < 0.05).

Magnetic resonance linear accelerator (MR-linac) treatments require a daily multidisciplinary presence for delivery. To facilitate sustainable MRgART models, agreed protocols facilitating therapeutic radiographer (RTT)-led delivery must be developed to establish a service similar to conventional image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT). This work provides a clinical perspective on the implementation of a protocol-driven 'clinician-lite' MRgART workflow at one institution.  Methods:   To identify knowledge, skills, and competence required at each step in the MRgART workflow, an interdisciplinary informal survey and needs assessment were undertaken to identify additional or enhanced skills required for MRgART, over and above those required for conventional cone-beam computed tomography-based IGRT. The MRgART pathway was critically evaluated by relevant professionals to encourage multidisciplinary input and discussion, allowing an iterative development of the RTT-led workflow. Starting with the simplest online adaptation strategy, consisting of a virtual couch shift and online replanning, clear guidelines were established for the delivery of radical prostate radiotherapy with a reduction in staff numbers present.  Results:   The MRgART-specific skills identified included MRI safety and screening, MR image acquisition, MRI-based anatomy, multimodality image interpretation and registration, and treatment plan evaluation. These skills were developed in RTTs via tutorials, workshops, focussed self-directed reading, teaching of colleagues, and end-to-end workflow testing. After initial treatments and discussions, roles and responsibilities of the three professional groups (clinicians, RTTs, and physicists) have evolved to achieve a 'clinician-lite' workflow for simple radical prostate treatments.  Discussion:   Through applying a definitive framework and establishing agreed threshold and action levels for action within anticipated treatment scenarios similar to those in cone-beam computed tomography-based IGRT, we have implemented a 'clinician-lite' workflow for simple adaptive treatments on the MR-linac. The responsibility for online plan evaluation and approval now rests with physicists and RTTs to streamline MRgART. Early evaluation of the framework after treatment of 10 patients has required minimal online clinician input (1.5% of 200 fractions delivered).  Conclusion:   A 'clinician-lite' prostate treatment workflow has been successfully introduced on the MR-linac at our institution and will serve as a model for other tumour sites, using more complex adaptive strategies. Early indications are that this framework has the potential to improve patient throughput and efficiency. Further identification and validation of roles and responsibilities such as online contouring, and more interactive online planning, will facilitate RTTs to fully lead in the online workflow as adaptive radiotherapy becomes ever more complex.""","""['Rosie B Hales', 'John Rodgers', 'Lee Whiteside', 'Lisa McDaid', 'Joseph Berresford', 'Geoff Budgell', 'Ananya Choudhury', 'Cynthia L Eccles']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Med Imaging Radiat Sci""","""['Evaluation of therapeutic radiographer contouring for magnetic resonance image guided online adaptive prostate radiotherapy.', 'An unusual case of oedematous prostate volumetric changes observed over the course of radiotherapy on the MR linear accelerator.', 'Online Magnetic Resonance Image Guided Adaptive Radiation Therapy: First Clinical Applications.', 'The Pivotal Role of the Therapeutic Radiographer/Radiation Therapist in Image-guided Radiotherapy Research and Development.', 'MRI-GUIDED RADIOTHERAPY FOR PROSTATE CANCER: A NEW PARADIGM.', 'Practice-based training strategy for therapist-driven prostate MR-Linac adaptive radiotherapy.', 'The current and future role of the MRI radiographer in radiation oncology: A collaborative, experiential reflection on the Australian rollout of dedicated MRI simulators.', 'Introduction of radiation therapist-led adaptive treatments on a 1.5 T MR-Linac.', 'Old dogs, new tricks: MR-Linac training and credentialing of radiation oncologists, radiation therapists and medical physicists.', 'Online adaptive MR-guided radiotherapy: Conformity of contour adaptation for prostate cancer, rectal cancer and lymph node oligometastases among radiation therapists and radiation oncologists.']"""

The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of radioimmunotherapy is myelosuppression; dose fractionation of 177Lu-J591 allows similar administered doses with less toxicity. This study (NCT00916123) was designed to determine the safety, DLT, and maximum tolerated dose of fractionated 177Lu-J591 administered concurrently with standard docetaxel.  Methods:   Men with progressive mCRPC received docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks with escalating 2 fractionated doses of 177Lu-J591 (1.48 GBq/m2 up to max of 2.96 GBq/m2) with cycle 3. Cycle 4 of docetaxel was planned 6 weeks after cycle 3 to allow for recovery from 177Lu-J591-associated hematologic toxicity. DLT was defined as delay in docetaxel >3 weeks, prolonged myelosuppression or need for >2 platelet transfusions, febrile neutropenia, or grade ≥3 nonhematological toxicity following 177Lu-J591. PSA was assessed prior to each cycle and serial computed tomography (CT) and bone scan were performed.  Results:   Fifteen men with progressive mCRPC received dose-escalated targeted radionuclide therapy in 4 cohorts up to the highest planned dose (2.96 GBq/m2). No DLT was seen at any dose level. Grade 4 neutropenia without fever occurred in 8 (53.5%) and thromboytopenia in 2 (13.3%), with 2 receiving prophylactic platelet transfusion. No grade ≥3 nonhematological toxicity was observed. 11 (73.3%) had >50% PSA decline, with 78.6% having favorable circulating tumor cell counts after 177Lu-J591.

In multivariable logistic regression models, TB were associated with higher concordance rates before (odds ratio [OR]: 1.13; P = 0.04) and after 1:3 PS matching (OR: 1.15; P 0.03), compared to SB. In TB patients, age (OR: 0.98; P = 0.04), maximum cancer core involvement (MCCI; OR: 1.02; P = 0.02) and maximum cancer core length (MCCL; OR: 1.01; P = 0.07) were associated with ISUP GG concordance. Moreover, a trend for lower concordance rates was observed with higher PSA-D (OR: 0.77; P = 0.1). Finally, intermediate lesion location at mpMRI was associated with lowest concordance rates (44%).  Conclusion:   In biopsy naïve patients treated with RP, TB achieved higher rates of ISUP GG concordance, but same percentages of csPCa missed, compared to SB.

Radium223 (Rad223), a bone targeting radioisotope improves overall survival in patients (3.6 months vs. placebo). However, clinical response is often followed by relapse and disease progression, and associated mechanisms of efficacy and resistance are poorly understood. Research efforts to overcome this gap require a substantial investment of time and resources. Computational models, integrated with experimental data, can overcome this limitation and drive research in a more effective fashion.  Methods:   Accordingly, we developed a predictive agent-based model of prostate cancer bone metastasis progression and response to Rad223 as an agile platform to maximize its efficacy. The driving coefficients were calibrated on ad hoc experimental observations retrieved from intravital microscopy and the outcome further validated, in vivo.  Results:   In this work we offered a detailed description of our data-integrated computational infrastructure, tested its accuracy and robustness, quantified the uncertainty of its driving coefficients, and showed the role of tumor size and distance from bone on Rad223 efficacy. In silico tumor growth, which is strongly driven by its mitotic character as identified by sensitivity analysis, matched in vivo trend with 98.3% confidence. Tumor size determined efficacy of Rad223, with larger lesions insensitive to therapy, while medium- and micro-sized tumors displayed up to 5.02 and 152.28-fold size decrease compared to control-treated tumors, respectively. Eradication events occurred in 65 ± 2% of cases in micro-tumors only. In addition, Rad223 lost any therapeutic effect, also on micro-tumors, for distances bigger than 400 μm from the bone interface.

As dose constraints to organs at risk had priority over dose escalation and suboptimal planning could occur, we investigated how well the dose to the tumor was boosted. We developed an anatomy-based prediction model to identify plans with suboptimal tumor dose and performed replanning to validate our model.  Methods and materials:   We derived dose-volume parameters from planned dose distributions of 539 FLAME trial patients in 4 institutions and compared them between both arms. In the dose-escalated arm, we determined overlap volume histograms and derived features representing patient anatomy. We predicted tumor D98% with a linear regression on anatomic features and performed replanning on 21 plans.  Results:   In the dose-escalated arm, the median tumor D50% and D98% were 93.0 and 84.7 Gy, and 99% of the tumors had a dose escalation greater than 82.4 Gy (107% of 77 Gy). In both arms organs at risk constraints were met. Five out of 73 anatomic features were found to be predictive for tumor D98%. Median predicted tumor D98% was 4.4 Gy higher than planned D98%. Upon replanning, median tumor D98% increased by 3.0 Gy. A strong correlation between predicted increase in D98% and realized increase upon replanning was found (ρ = 0.86).  Conclusions:   Focal dose escalation in prostate cancer was feasible with a dose escalation to 99% of the tumors. Replanning resulted in an increased tumor dose that correlated well with the prediction model. The model was able to identify tumors on which a higher boost dose could be planned.

We used multivariable models to examine MCAHPS measures (getting needed care, timeliness of care, and doctor communication) and multimorbidity on CM use.  Results:   Localized prostate cancer patients with multimorbidity were less likely to use CM (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=0.42 (0.27- 0.66), P < .001); those with higher scores on timeliness of care (AOR = 1.21 (1.09, 1.35), P < .001), higher education attainment (3.21 = AOR (1.50,6.89), P = .003), and impaired mental health status (4.32 = AOR (1.86, 10.1) P < .001) were more likely to use CM.

Cell proliferation was evaluated via Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation, and nude mouse tumorigenicity assays. Luciferase reporter assay was applied to identify target genes. p27kip1 protein expression in PCa was investigated using Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry.  Results:   There was a dramatic upregulation of miR-196a in PCa. Upregulated miR-196a was related to worse Gleason score (GS), later pathological stage, and poor biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival. In vivo and in vitro experiments exhibited that miR-196a promoted PCa proliferation and expedited G1/S-phase progression through the downregulation of p27kip1 protein. Additionally, p27kip1 protein was distinctly downregulated in PCa.

Confirmation of prostatic origin, especially when evaluating a metastatic focus, often requires correlation with clinical and imaging findings, as the morphologic and immunohistochemical features of SCC are not organ-specific. Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) may provide additional information useful for confirming the primary site and for identifying potential targeted therapy options. CGP data may also contribute to our understanding of the molecular basis of squamous differentiation in prostatic malignancies. However, these data are limited, and to our knowledge, there are only three previously published cases of prostatic SCC with reported CGP findings. Herein, we report a case of metastatic keratinizing SCC diagnosed by core needle biopsy in a 68-year-old man with a history of prostatic adenocarcinoma status post radical prostatectomy and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

Yet the relevance of these CRSC in the course of the human disease and particularly for the transition from hormone-naive (HN) to castration-resistance is unclear. In this study, we aimed at deciphering the significance of CRSC markers in PCa progression.  Methods:   We constructed a tissue microarray comprising 112 matched HN and CR tissue specimens derived from 55 PCa patients. Expression of eight stemness-associated markers (ALDH1A1, ALDH1A3, ALDH3A1, BMI1, NANOG, NKX3.1, OCT4, SOX2) was assessed by immunohistochemistry and scored as a percentage of positive tumor cells. For each marker, the resulting scores were statistically analyzed and compared to pathological and clinical data associated with the samples. Unsupervised clustering analysis was performed to stratify patients according to the expression of the eight CRSC markers. Publicly-available transcriptional datasets comprising HN and CR PCa samples were interrogated to assess the expression of the factors in silico.  Results:   Immunohistochemical assessment of paired samples revealed atypical patterns of expression and intra- and intertumor heterogeneity for a subset of CRSC markers. While the expression of particular CRSC markers was dynamic over time in some patients, none of the markers showed significant changes in expression upon the development of castration resistance (CR vs HN). Using unsupervised clustering approaches, we identified phenotypic subtypes based on the expression of specific stem-associated markers. In particular, we found (a) patterns of mutual exclusivity for ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A3 expression, which was also observed at the transcriptomic level in publicly-available PCa datasets, and (b) a phenotypic cluster associated with more aggressive features. Finally, by comparing HN and CR matched samples, we identified phenotypic cluster switches (ie, change of phenotypic cluster between the HN and CR state), that may be associated with clinical and predictive relevance.  Conclusions:   Our findings indicate stemness-associated patterns that are associated with the development of castration-resistance. These results pave the way toward a deeper understanding of the relevance of CRSC markers in PCa progression and resistance to androgen-deprivation therapy.""","""['Joël R Federer-Gsponer', 'David C Müller', 'Tobias Zellweger', 'Maurice Eggimann', 'Katharina Marston', 'Christian Ruiz', 'Hans-Helge Seifert', 'Cyrill A Rentsch', 'Lukas Bubendorf', 'Clémentine Le Magnen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['ALDH1A3 serves as a predictor for castration resistance in prostate cancer patients.', 'The Role of Castration-Resistant Bmi1+Sox2+ Cells in Driving Recurrence in Prostate Cancer.', 'ALDH1A1-related stemness in high-grade serous ovarian cancer is a negative prognostic indicator but potentially targetable by EGFR/mTOR-PI3K/aurora kinase inhibitors.', 'Prostate cancer stem cells: deciphering the origins and pathways involved in prostate tumorigenesis and aggression.', 'ZBTB46, SPDEF, and ETV6: Novel Potential Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Aldehyde dehydrogenase in solid tumors and other diseases: Potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.', 'AC010973.2 promotes cell proliferation and is one of six stemness-related genes that predict overall survival of renal clear cell carcinoma.', 'Dynamic prostate cancer transcriptome analysis delineates the trajectory to disease progression.', 'Understanding and targeting prostate cancer cell heterogeneity and plasticity.', 'The Multifaceted Role of Aldehyde Dehydrogenases in Prostate Cancer Stem Cells.']"""

In this study, cancer-derived immunoglobulin G (CIgG) is found to be induced after ADT, identifying CIgG as a potential CRPC driver gene.  Methods:   The expression of CIgG and its clinical significance in PCa tissue was analyzed by The Cancer Genome Atlas database and immunohistochemistry. Subsequently, the sequence features of prostate cell line VHDJH rearrangements were analyzed. We also assessed the effect of CIgG on the migratory, invasive and proliferative abilities of PCa cells in vitro and vivo. Suspended microsphere, colony formation and drug-resistant assays were performed using PC3 cells with high CIgG expression (CIgGhigh ) and low CIgG expression (CIgG-/low ), and A nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mouse tumor xenograft model was developed for the study of the tumorigenic effects of the different cell populations. The SOX2-CIgG signaling pathway was validated by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, luciferase, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and bioinformatics analyses. Finally, we investigated the effect of RP215 inhibition on the progression of PCa in vivo using a Babl/c nude mouse xenograft model.  Results:   CIgG is frequently expressed in PCa and associated with clinicopathological characteristics, moreover, CIgG transcripts with unique patterns of VHDJH rearrangements are found in PCa cells. Functional analyses identified that CIgG was induced by ADT and upregulated by SOX2 (SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 2) in PCa, promoting the development of PCa. In addition, our findings underscore a novel role of CIgG signaling in the maintenance of stemness and the progression of cancer through mitogen activated protein kinase/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase and AKT in PCa. In vivo experiments further demonstrated that depleting CIgG significantly suppressed the growth of PCa cell xenografts. Furthermore, a CIgG monoclonal antibody named RP215 exhibits tumor inhibitory effect as well.  Conclusion:   Our data suggests that CIgG could be a driver of PCa development, and that targeting the SOX2-CIgG axis may therefore inhibit PCa development after ADT.""","""['Caipeng Qin', 'Zhengzuo Sheng', 'Xinmei Huang', 'Jingshu Tang', 'Yang Liu', 'Tao Xu', 'Xiaoyan Qiu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['MYBL2 disrupts the Hippo-YAP pathway and confers castration resistance and metastatic potential in prostate cancer.', 'RGS2 is prognostic for development of castration resistance and cancer-specific survival in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Lung squamous cell carcinoma cells express non-canonically glycosylated IgG that activates integrin-FAK signaling.', 'ZBTB46, SPDEF, and ETV6: Novel Potential Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'SIA-IgG confers poor prognosis and represents a novel therapeutic target in breast cancer.', 'Cancer-Cell-Derived IgG and Its Potential Role in Tumor Development.', 'Upregulated Expression of Cancer-Derived Immunoglobulin G Is Associated With Progression in Glioma.', 'Current insights into the expression and functions of tumor-derived immunoglobulins.', 'High Expression of Cancer-IgG Is Associated With Poor Prognosis and Radioresistance via PI3K/AKT/DNA-PKcs Pathway Regulation in Lung Adenocarcinoma.']"""

Studies suggested that measurement of KLK2 serum levels advanced the predictive accuracy of PSA testing in prostate cancer.  Methods:   To clarify the potential utility of KLK2 as a prognostic tissue biomarker, KLK2 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in more than 12 000 prostate cancers.  Results:   Normal epithelium cells usually showed weak to moderate KLK2 immunostaining, whereas KLK2 was negative in 23%, weak in 38%, moderate in 35%, and strong in 4% of 9576 analyzable cancers. Lost or reduced KLK2 immunostaining was associated with advanced tumor stage, high Gleason score, lymph node metastasis, increased cell proliferation, positive resection margin, and early PSA recurrence (P < .0001). Comparison with previously analyzed molecular alterations revealed a strong association of KLK2 loss and presence of TMPRSS2:ERG fusion (P < .0001), most of all analyzed common deletions (9 of 11; P ≤ .03), and decreased PSA immunostaining (P < .0001 each). Cancers with combined negative or weak immunostaining of KLK2 and PSA showed worse prognosis than cancers with at least moderate staining of one or both proteins (P < .0001).

However, there is a lack of large analyses detailing pain outcomes and factors influencing pain.  Materials and methods:   From 2016 to 2019 we performed a multicenter prospective study in men undergoing multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-transperineal fusion biopsies (target+systematic cores) under local anesthesia. Primary outcomes were 1) pain scores (assessed through a 0 to 10-point numeric rating scale) and 2) identification of factors associated with severe pain. The secondary outcome was to evaluate pain influence on clinically significant prostate cancer target cores detection.  Results:   We included 1,008 men undergoing transperineal fusion biopsies under local anesthesia. Mean±SD numeric rating scale pain scores were 3.9±2.1 at local anesthesia administration and 3.1±2.3 when performing biopsies. Pain was not associated with lower clinically significant prostate cancer detection on targeted cores (p=0.23 and p=0.47 depending on clinically significant prostate cancer definition). On multivariate analysis age (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.94-0.99) and severe anxiety (OR 2.99, 95% CI 1.83-4.89) were a protective and risk factor, respectively, for severe biopsy pain. Procedural time was also associated with an increased risk of experiencing severe biopsy pain (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00-1.08). If aiming to test the possible effects of anxiety preventive measures on pain, an anxiety cutoff greater than 6 on a numeric rating scale would decrease to 13% the number of patients being treated while identifying 56% of those experiencing severe pain.  Conclusions:   Transperineal fusion biopsies under local anesthesia result in moderate pain. Pain does not influence clinically significant prostate cancer target detection. Patient anxiety predicts pain.

After transfection of Notch1‑saRNA‑1480 in PC3 cells, the expression of Notch1 and androgen receptor (AR) was investigated by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT‑qPCR) and western blotting. Furthermore, the protein expression level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was measured. Then, flow cytometry was used to analyze the cell cycle and apoptosis after transfection. Moreover, the migration and invasion ability of PC3 cells were assessed by transwell assays. Then, angiogenesis experiments were conducted to analyze the abilities of PC3 cells to form blood vessels. Furthermore, in vivo experiments detected the antitumor activity of Notch1‑saRNA‑1480. The mRNA and protein expression levels of Notch1 were significantly increased after transfection, while the expression levels of AR and VEGF were decreased. After transfection, the cell cycle was arrested at the G0/G1 checkpoint. Notch1‑saRNA‑1480 significantly increased the proportion of apoptotic cells after transfection. In addition, transwell assay results showed that PC3 cell migration and invasion were inhibited. The total vessel length was significantly decreased based on angiogenesis experiments, which indicated that PC3 cell angiogenesis was inhibited. In vivo experiments showed that Notch1‑saRNA‑1480 could inhibit tumor growth and volume. The protein expression of Notch1, AR, VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and VEGF in tumor tissues was consistent with in vitro levels.

Recently, the research of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has made breakthroughs in the development of human cancers. This study aimed to figure out the role and action mechanism of lncRNA PVT1 (PVT1) in PCa.  Methods:   The expression of PVT1, microRNA-15a-5p (miR-15a-5p) and kinesin family member 23 (KIF23) was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT), flow cytometry and transwell assays, respectively. The protein levels of KIF23 and proliferation, apoptosis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related markers were quantified by western blot. The relationship between miR-15a-5p and PVT1 or KIF23 was predicted by starBase v2.0 and verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Xenograft assay was conducted to determine the role of PVT1 in vivo.  Results:   The expression of PVT1 and KIF23 was enhanced, while miR-15a-5p expression was reduced in PCa tissues and cells. PVT1 interference inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion but promoted apoptosis of PCa cells. MiR-15a-5p was a target of PVT1, and KIF23 was a target of miR-15a-5p. The inhibition of miR-15a-5p reversed the effects of PVT1 interference and suppressed the roles of KIF23 knockdown. KIF23 expression was regulated by PVT1 through miR-15a-5p. PVT1 interference blocked PCa progression in vivo.  Conclusion:   PVT1 knockdown had effects on the progression of PCa by inhibiting the expression of KIF23 via enriching miR-15a-5p in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that PVT1 might be a novel biomarker for the treatment of PCa.""","""['Huijuan Wu#', 'Xin Tian#', 'Chaoyang Zhu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Cell Int""","""['The long non-coding RNA PVT1/miR-145-5p/ITGB8 axis regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion in non-small cell lung cancer cells.', 'Exosome-Derived Circ-PVT1 Contributes to Cisplatin Resistance by Regulating Autophagy, Invasion, and Apoptosis Via miR-30a-5p/YAP1 Axis in Gastric Cancer Cells.', 'LINC00511 knockdown suppresses glioma cell malignant progression through miR-15a-5p/AEBP1 axis.', 'Long non-coding RNA in prostate cancer.', 'Noncoding RNA PVT1 in osteosarcoma: The roles of lncRNA PVT1 and circPVT1.', 'KCNQ1OT1 promotes retinoblastoma progression by targeting miR-339-3p that suppresses KIF23.', 'Emerging RNA-Based Therapeutic and Diagnostic Options: Recent Advances and Future Challenges in Genitourinary Cancers.', 'Oncogenic Long Noncoding RNAs in Prostate Cancer, Osteosarcoma, and Metastasis.', 'N6‑methyladenosine‑induced long non‑coding RNA PVT1 regulates the miR‑27b‑3p/BLM axis to promote prostate cancer progression.', 'lncRNA PVT1: a novel oncogene in multiple cancers.']"""

The clinic information as age, tPSA, fPSA, prostate volume, Gleason score and PI-RADS v2 score have been collected. Univariate analysis was performed based on every variable to investigate the risk factors of high-grade prostate cancer. ROC curves were generated for the risk factors to distinguish the cut-off points. Logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the independent risk factors of high-grade prostate cancer. Nomogram prediction model was generated based on multivariate logistic regression analysis. The calibration curve, ROC curve, leave-one-out cross validation and independent external validation were performed to evaluate the discriminative ability, accuracy and stability of the nomogram prediction model. Results: Of 316 patients, a total of 187 patients were diagnosed as high-grade prostate cancer. Univariate analysis showed tPSA, fPSA, prostate volume, PSAD and PI-RADS v2 score were significantly different between the high- and low-grade prostate cancer patients. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses showed only tPSA, prostate volume and PI-RADS v2 score were the independent risk factors of high-grade prostate cancer. The nomogram could predict the probability of high-grade prostate cancer, with a sensitivity of 79.4% and a specificity of 77.6%. The calibration curve displayed good agreement of the predicted probability with the actual observed probability. AUC of the ROC curve was 0.840 (0.797-0.884).

ADRB2 expression and associated clinical outcomes in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) are unknown.  Methods and materials:   This was a retrospective analysis of a multi-center, prospectively enrolled cohort of mCRPC patients. Metastatic biopsies were obtained at progression, and specimens underwent laser capture microdissection and RNA-seq. ADRB2 expression was stratified by histology and clustering based on unsupervised hierarchical transcriptome analysis and correlated with EZH2 expression; an external dataset was used for validation. The association between ADRB2 expression and overall survival (OS) was assessed by log-rank test and a multivariable Cox proportional hazard model.  Results:   One hundred and twenty-seven patients with progressive mCRPC had sufficient metastatic tumor for RNA-seq. ADRB2 expression was lowest in the small cell-enriched transcriptional cluster (P < 0.01) and correlated inversely with EZH2 expression (r = -0.28, P < 0.01). These findings were validated in an external cohort enriched for neuroendocrine differentiation. Patients with tumors harboring low ADRB2 expression (lowest quartile) had a shorter median OS than those with higher (9.5 vs. 20.5 months, P = 0.02). In multivariable analysis, low ADRB2 expression was associated with a trend toward shorter OS (HR for death = 1.54, 95%CI 0.98-2.44). Conversely, higher expression of upstream transcriptional regulator EZH2 was associated with shortened OS (HR for death = 3.01, 95%CI 1.12-8.09).  Conclusions:   Low ADRB2 expression is associated with neuroendocrine differentiation and is associated with shortened survival.

Patients were stratified as clinically insignificant and clinically significant PCa, based on Grade Group (GG) 1 and ≥2, respectively. Survival was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   There were 329 (20%) patients with incidentally detected PCa at RC: 245 (15%) GG1, 52 (3.2%) GG2, 20 (1.2%) GG3, 6 (0.4%) GG4, and 6 (0.4%) GG5.

Despite guideline support, it is unclear if a brachytherapy (BT) boost should be considered for cN1 patients as these patients were excluded from randomized trials establishing its benefit. Herein, we compare definitive radiation therapy (RT) with or without a BT boost in cN1 PC.  Methods and materials:   The National Cancer Database was used to identify men with cN1 PC treated with definitive RT and concomitant androgen deprivation therapy between 2004 and 2013.

Objective:   To investigate long-term oncological outcomes after sLND in a large multi-institutional series.  Design, setting, and participants:   The study included 189 patients who experienced prostate-specific antigen (PSA) rise and nodal-only recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RP) and underwent sLND at 11 tertiary referral centers between 2002 and 2011. Lymph node recurrence was documented by positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan using either 11C-choline or 68Ga prostate-specific membrane antigen ligand.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary outcome of the study was cancer-specific mortality (CSM). The secondary outcomes were overall mortality, clinical recurrence (CR), biochemical recurrence (BCR), and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)-free survival after sLND. The probability of freedom from each outcome was calculated using Kaplan-Meier analyses. Cox regression analysis was used to predict the risk of prostate CSM after accounting for several parameters, including the use of additional treatments after sLND.  Results and limitations:   At long term, 110 and 163 patients experienced CR and BCR, respectively, with CR-free and BCR-free survival at 10 yr of 31% and 11%, respectively. After sLND, a total of 145 patients received ADT, with a median time to ADT of 41 mo. At a median (interquartile range) follow-up for survivors of 87 (51, 104) mo, 48 patients died. Of them, 45 died from PCa. The probabilities of freedom from cancer-specific and all-cause death at 10 yr were 66% and 64%, respectively. Similar results were obtained in sensitivity analyses in patients with pelvic-only positive PET/CT scan, as well as after excluding men on ADT at PET/CT scan and patients with PSA level at sLND higher than the 75th percentile. At multivariable analyses, patients who had PSA response after sLND (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.45; p = 0.001), and those receiving ADT within 6 mo from sLND (HR: 0.51; p = 0.010) had lower risk of death from PCa.  Conclusions:   A third of men treated with sLND for PET-detected nodal recurrence of PCa died at long term, with PCa being the main cause of death. Salvage LND alone was associated with durable long-term outcomes in a minority of men who significantly benefited from additional treatments after surgery. Taken together, all these data argue against the use of metastasis-directed therapy alone for patients with node-only recurrent PCa. These men should instead be considered at high risk of systemic dissemination already at the time of sLND.  Patient summary:   We assessed long-term outcomes of patients treated with salvage lymph node dissection (sLND) for node-recurrent prostate cancer (PCa). In contrast with prior evidence, we found that the majority of these men recurred after sLND and eventually died from PCa. A significant survival benefit associated with the administration of androgen deprivation therapy after sLND suggests that sLND should be considered part of a multimodal approach rather than an exclusive treatment strategy.""","""['Carlo A Bravi', 'Nicola Fossati', 'Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Nazareno Suardi', 'Elio Mazzone', 'Daniele Robesti', 'Daniar Osmonov', 'Klaus-Peter Juenemann', 'Luca Boeri', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Alexander Kretschmer', 'Alexander Buchner', 'Christian Stief', 'Andreas Hiester', 'Alessandro Nini', 'Peter Albers', 'Gaëtan Devos', 'Steven Joniau', 'Hendrik Van Poppel', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Axel Heidenreich', 'David Pfister', 'Derya Tilki', 'Markus Graefen', 'Inderbir S Gill', 'Alexander Mottrie', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Alberto Briganti']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Salvage Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection for Nodal Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy Results in Minimal Clinical Benefit.', 'Re: Carlo A.

Results from a Multi-institutional Series""","""The best surgical template for salvage pelvic lymph node dissection (sLND) in patients with nodal recurrence from prostate cancer (PCa) after radical prostatectomy (RP) is currently unknown. We analyzed data of 189 patients with a unilateral positive positron emission tomography (PET) scan of the pelvic lymph node areas, who were treated with bilateral pelvic sLND after RP at 11 high-volume centers. The primary endpoint was missed contralateral disease at final pathology, defined as lymph node positive for PCa in the side opposite to the positive spot(s) at the PET scan. Overall, 93 (49%) and 96 (51%) patients received a 11C-choline and a 68Ga prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET scan, respectively, and 171 (90%) and 18 (10%) men had one and two positive spots, respectively. The rate of missed contralateral PCa was 18% (34/189), with the rates being 17% (29/171) and 28% (5/18) in men with one and two positive spots, respectively. While the rate of contralateral disease did not differ between 68Ga-PSMA and 11C-choline (29% and 27%, respectively) among men with two positive spots, the rate of contralateral PCa was only 6% with 68Ga-PSMA versus 28% with 11C-choline in patients with a single positive spot. This finding was confirmed at multivariable logistic regression analysis predicting missed disease at final pathology after accounting for confounders (odds ratio: 0.24; p = 0.001). However, in men with a single positive spot at 68Ga-PSMA PET/computed tomography, the rate of single confirmed lymph node metastasis at final pathology was only 33%, suggesting the need for extended template even if unilateral dissection is performed. Awaiting confirmatory studies, patients diagnosed with a single positive spot at the 68Ga-PSMA PET scan might be considered for unilateral extended pelvic sLND. PATIENT SUMMARY: We assessed the risk of missing contralateral disease in patients with a positron emission tomography (PET) scan suggestive of unilateral nodal recurrence from prostate cancer (PCa) after radical prostatectomy and who were treated with bilateral salvage lymph node dissection (sLND). Variability exists according to the number of positive spots and PET tracer, with the lowest rate of missed PCa in men diagnosed with a single positive spot at a 68Ga prostate-specific membrane antigen PET scan (6%). If replicated, our data suggest that these patients might be considered for unilateral extended pelvic sLND.""","""['Carlo A Bravi', 'Nicola Fossati', 'Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Nazareno Suardi', 'Elio Mazzone', 'Daniele Robesti', 'Daniar Osmonov', 'Klaus-Peter Juenemann', 'Luca Boeri', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Alexander Kretschmer', 'Alexander Buchner', 'Christian Stief', 'Andreas Hiester', 'Alessandro Nini', 'Peter Albers', 'Gaëtan Devos', 'Steven Joniau', 'Hendrik Van Poppel', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Axel Heidenreich', 'David Pfister', 'Derya Tilki', 'Markus Graefen', 'Inderbir S Gill', 'Alexander Mottrie', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Alberto Briganti']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Long-term Outcomes of Salvage Lymph Node Dissection for Nodal Recurrence of Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy: Not as Good as Previously Thought.', 'Underestimation of Positron Emission Tomography/Computerized Tomography in Assessing Tumor Burden in Prostate Cancer Nodal Recurrence: Head-to-Head Comparison of 68Ga-PSMA and 11C-Choline in a Large, Multi-Institutional Series of Extended Salvage Lymph Node Dissections.', 'Defining the optimal template of salvage lymph node dissection for unilateral pelvic nodal recurrence of prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'Contemporary role of salvage lymphadenectomy in patients with recurrence following radical prostatectomy.', 'Necessity of Pelvic Lymph Node Irradiation in Patients with Recurrent Prostate Cancer after Radical Prostatectomy in the PSMA PET/CT Era: A Narrative Review.', 'Combining PSA and PET features to select candidates for salvage lymph node dissection in recurrent prostate cancer.', '18F-DCFPyL (PSMA) PET in the Management of Men with Biochemical Failure after Primary Therapy: Initial Clinical Experience of an Academic Cancer Center.', 'Patient-Reported and Oncological Outcomes of Salvage Therapies for PSMA-Positive Nodal Recurrent Prostate Cancer: Real-Life Experiences and Implications for Future Trial Design.', 'The role of surgery in high risk and advanced prostate cancer: A narrative review.']"""

BAT has shown clinical activity in prior studies enrolling men with mCRPC and may potentially restore sensitivity to prior androgen receptor (AR)-targeted agents.  Objective:   To evaluate the clinical activity of BAT in patients progressing on AR-targeted therapy as well as responses to abiraterone or enzalutamide upon rechallenge after BAT.  Design, setting, and participants:   RESTORE is a multicohort phase II study enrolling asymptomatic mCRPC patients after abiraterone or enzalutamide at Johns Hopkins Hospital (NCT02090114). Participants (29 after abiraterone and 30 after enzalutamide) received 400 mg testosterone cypionate intramuscularly every 28 days, with ongoing luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist/antagonist treatment (ie, BAT). Following progression on BAT, patients were rechallenged with their most recent AR-targeted therapy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Coprimary endpoints were >50% decline in PSA from baseline (PSA50) responses to BAT and following AR-targeted therapy rechallenge. Outcomes in the post-abiraterone cohort are presented, as well as updated results from the post-enzalutamide cohort and an exploratory AR-V7 analysis.  Results and limitations:   No statistically significant difference in PSA50 response rates to BAT was observed (30% [post-enzalutamide cohort] vs 17% [post-abiraterone cohort], p = 0.4). However, PSA50 responses to AR-targeted therapy rechallenge were higher in the post-enzalutamide cohort (68% vs 16%, p = 0.001). The median time from enrollment to progression following rechallenge with AR-targeted therapy (ie, progression-free survival 2; PFS2) was longer in the post-enzalutamide versus post-abiraterone patients (12.8 vs 8.1 mo, p = 0.04). Outcomes were worse in patients with detectable AR-V7 in circulating tumor cells (median PFS2: 10.3 vs 7.1 mo, p = 0.005).  Conclusions:   BAT shows clinical activity in mCRPC patients and may be more effective at resensitizing to enzalutamide versus abiraterone.  Patient summary:   BAT is well tolerated in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients. The type of prior AR-targeted therapy might affect response to BAT as well as AR-therapy rechallenge. BAT followed by AR-targeted therapy rechallenge did not improve outcomes in AR-V7-positive patients.""","""['Mark C Markowski', 'Hao Wang', 'Rana Sullivan', 'Irina Rifkind', 'Victoria Sinibaldi', 'Michael T Schweizer', 'Benjamin A Teply', 'Nduku Ngomba', 'Wei Fu', 'Michael A Carducci', 'Channing J Paller', 'Catherine H Marshall', 'Mario A Eisenberger', 'Jun Luo', 'Emmanuel S Antonarakis', 'Samuel R Denmeade']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Bipolar androgen therapy in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer after progression on enzalutamide: an open-label, phase 2, multicohort study.', 'Efficacy and safety of bipolar androgen therapy in mCRPC after progression on abiraterone or enzalutamide: A systematic review.', 'Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 and Efficacy of Taxane Chemotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'AR-V7 Androgen Receptor Variant as a Predictor of Response to Androgen-receptor Targeting Agents Used to Treat Castration-refractory Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting persistent androgen receptor signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Bipolar Androgen Therapy: When Excess Fuel Extinguishes the Fire.', 'Strategies to Re-Sensitize Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer to Antiandrogen Therapy.', 'Bipolar Androgen Therapy Followed by Androgen Receptor Inhibition as Sequential Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Potent Stimulation of the Androgen Receptor Instigates a Viral Mimicry Response in Prostate Cancer.', 'MYC-driven increases in mitochondrial DNA copy number occur early and persist throughout prostatic cancer progression.']"""

We hypothesized that mtSPOP would be associated with improved outcomes to systemic therapy in men with de novo metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (d-mCSPC). Retrospective data of newly diagnosed d-mCSPC patients were collected from four institutions. Eligibility criteria included standard androgen deprivation therapy without intensification, and SPOP mutational status (mtSPOP or wild-type SPOP [wtSPOP]) determination by targeted next-generation sequencing from tumor biopsies. A total of 121 men (25 mtSPOP [21%] and 96 wtSPOP [79%]) were included. After adjusting for covariates, mtSPOP was significantly associated with better median progression-free survival (35 vs 13 mo; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.47; p = 0.016) and overall survival (97 vs 69 mo; adjusted HR 0.32; p = 0.027), with similar HR and p value on the univariate analysis. These findings, upon external validation, may assist with counseling and prognostication in the clinic, and inform the design of future clinical trials in this setting.

Patients and methods:   We prospectively collected data from 50 consecutive patients with prostate adenocarcinoma who underwent RARP using this robot. The median follow-up was 53 days. We performed a transperitoneal technique. The robotic (multiport) trocar was placed on the supra-umbilical midline 20 cm from the pubis and an assistant trocar placed in the right lower quadrant. We report our initial experience describing the intra- and postoperative outcomes associated with this new robot. Also, we report the early functional and oncological outcomes in the follow-up period considered. Continuous variables were described as medians and interquartile ranges, while categorical variables as frequencies and proportions.  Results:   The median total operative time was 118 min, median console time was 80 min, and median estimated blood loss was 50 mL. There were no intraoperative complications or blood transfusions. The final pathology reported 18% Grade Group (GrGp)1, 58% GrGp2, 18% GrGp3, 2% GrGp4, and 4% GrGp5. In all, 40 patients (80%) were pT2 and 20% were ≥pT3a.

Propensity score matching methods and multivariable regression analysis were used to adjust for potential confounders and a trend analysis was conducted.  Results:   Patients with AF had a significantly longer hospital stay (coefficient 0.19, 95% CI 0.09-0.29, P < 0.001) and higher cost (coefficient 0.10, 95% CI 0.06-0.15, P < 0.001).

The results of trend study indicated that postoperative cardiac complication rates showed a trend of decreasing year by year while the prevalence of AF was rising.  Conclusions:   Perioperative AF is associated with increased cardiac complications, longer hospital stay and higher cost in PCa patients undergoing RP.

Material and methods:   Five low and intermediate risk prostate cancer patients were treated with 20 × 3.1 Gy fractions on a 1.5T MR-Linac. Each fraction, initial MRI (Pre) scans were obtained at the start of every treatment session. Pre-treatment planning MRI contours were propagated and adapted to this Pre scan after which plan re-optimization was started in the treatment planning system followed by dose delivery. 3D Cine-MR imaging was started simultaneously with beam-on and acquired over the full beam-on period. Prostate intrafraction motion in this cine-MR was determined with a previously validated soft-tissue contrast based tracking algorithm. In addition, absolute accuracy of the method was determined using a 4D phantom.  Results:   Prostate motion was completely automatically determined over the full on-couch period (approx. 45 min) with no identified mis-registrations. The translation 95% confidence intervals are within clinically applied margins of 5 mm, and plan adaption for intrafraction motion was required in only 4 out of 100 fractions.  Conclusion:   This is the first study to investigate prostate intrafraction motions during entire MR-guided RT sessions on an MR-Linac. We have shown that high quality 3D cine-MR imaging and prostate tracking during RT is feasible with beam-on. The clinically applied margins of 5 mm have proven to be sufficient for these treatments and may potentially be further reduced using intrafraction plan adaptation guided by cine-MR imaging.""","""['D M de Muinck Keizer', 'L G W Kerkmeijer', 'T Willigenburg', 'A L H M W van Lier', 'M D den Hartogh', 'J R N van der Voort van Zyp', 'E N de Groot-van Breugel', 'B W Raaymakers', 'J J W Lagendijk', 'J C J de Boer']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Seminal vesicle intrafraction motion during the delivery of radiotherapy sessions on a 1.5 T MR-Linac.', 'Soft-tissue prostate intrafraction motion tracking in 3D cine-MR for MR-guided radiotherapy.', 'Clinical application of a sub-fractionation workflow for intrafraction re-planning during prostate radiotherapy treatment on a 1.5 Tesla MR-Linac: A practical method to mitigate intrafraction motion.', 'Primary treatment of prostate cancer using 1.5\xa0T MR-linear accelerator.', 'Modern radiation therapy planning and image-guided radiotherapy using the example of prostate cancer.', 'Assessment of intrafraction motion and its dosimetric impact on prostate radiotherapy using an in-house developed position monitoring system.', 'Film measurement and analytical approach for assessing treatment accuracy and latency in a magnetic resonance-guided radiotherapy system.', 'Dose accumulation for MR-guided adaptive radiotherapy: From practical considerations to state-of-the-art clinical implementation.', 'Assessment of delivered dose in prostate cancer patients treated with ultra-hypofractionated radiotherapy on 1.5-Tesla MR-Linac.', 'Introduction of radiation therapist-led adaptive treatments on a 1.5 T MR-Linac.']"""

The ceRNA (competing endogenous RNAs) network is well-known in modulating tumor pathological and physiological processes. This research aims to determine the more effective molecular mechanisms of lncRNA PCGEM1 (prostate cancer gene expression marker 1).  Methods:   Bioinformatics database and Ago2-RIP were performed to predict and verify the potential targets of lncRNA PCGEM1. Both gain- and loss-of-function experiments were carried out to dissect the biological functions of RNAs. Fluorescence in situ hybridization, dual-luciferase reporter assays, western blot, and real-time PCR (RT-PCR) experiments were utilized to determine the pathophysiological pathways of competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs).  Results:   GC cells expressed high levels of cytoplasmic PCGEM1. Loss-of-function experiments displayed that the silencing of PCGEM1 suppressed metastatic and invasive cell qualities. PCGEM1 was also found to have associations with miR-129-5p. Subsequently, luciferase reporter and RIP experiments, together with RT-PCR, verified that PCGEM1 functioned as a ceRNA of P4HA2 (Prolyl 4-Hydroxylase Subunit Alpha 2) via sponging miR-129-5p to up-regulate P4HA2 expression. Finally, the rescue assays determined that P4HA2 overexpression rescued the inhibited cell invasion and metastasis caused by PCGEM1 down-regulation.  Conclusion:   These findings found that an over-expression of PCGEM1 in GC acts as a miR-129-5p sponge, leading to higher levels of P4HA2.

Models for predicting Pareto optimal dose distributions have generated optimal plans in real time using anatomical structures and static beam orientations. However, Pareto optimal dose prediction for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) prostate planning with variable beam numbers and orientations has not yet been investigated. We propose to develop a deep learning model that can predict Pareto optimal dose distributions by using any given set of beam angles, along with patient anatomy, as input to train the deep neural networks. We implement and compare two deep learning networks that predict with two different beam configuration modalities.  Methods:   We generated Pareto optimal plans for 70 patients with prostate cancer. We used fluence map optimization to generate 500 IMRT plans that sampled the Pareto surface for each patient, for a total of 35 000 plans. We studied and compared two different models, Models I and II. Although they both used the same anatomical structures - including the planning target volume (PTV), organs at risk (OARs), and body - these models were designed with two different methods for representing beam angles. Model I directly uses beam angles as a second input to the network as a binary vector. Model II converts the beam angles into beam doses that are conformal to the PTV. We divided the 70 patients into 54 training, 6 validation, and 10 testing patients, thus yielding 27 000 training, 3000 validation, and 5000 testing plans. Mean square loss (MSE) was taken as the loss function. We used the Adam optimizer with a default learning rate of 0.01 to optimize the network's performance. We evaluated the models' performance by comparing their predicted dose distributions with the ground truth (Pareto optimal) dose distribution, in terms of dose volume histogram (DVH) plots and evaluation metrics such as PTV D98 , D95 , D50 , D2 , Dmax , Dmean , Paddick Conformation Number, R50, and Homogeneity index.  Results:   Our deep learning models predicted voxel-level dose distributions that precisely matched the ground truth dose distributions. The DVHs generated also precisely matched the ground truth. Evaluation metrics such as PTV statistics, dose conformity, dose spillage (R50), and homogeneity index also confirmed the accuracy of PTV curves on the DVH. Quantitatively, Model I's prediction error of 0.043 (confirmation), 0.043 (homogeneity), 0.327 (R50), 2.80% (D95), 3.90% (D98), 0.6% (D50), and 1.10% (D2) was lower than that of Model II, which obtained 0.076 (confirmation), 0.058 (homogeneity), 0.626 (R50), 7.10% (D95), 6.50% (D98), 8.40% (D50), and 6.30% (D2). Model I also outperformed Model II in terms of the mean dose error and the max dose error on the PTV, bladder, rectum, left femoral head, and right femoral head.  Conclusions:   Treatment planners who use our models will be able to use deep learning to control the trade-offs between the PTV and OAR weights, as well as the beam number and configurations in real time.

The aim of our study is to compare pathological findings of prostate biopsy, In-bore or Fusion technique, with histopathological evaluation of radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   We prospectively collected data from 90 consecutive patients who underwent either In-bore or Fusion biopsy following the detection of an index suspicious lesion at mpMRI in the anterior part of the prostatic gland. Bioptical pathological findings were compared with pathological findings reported after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.  Results:   Patients who underwent In-bore GB had a higher rate of previous negative prostate biopsies (19% vs 44%, p = 0.02). Median number of bioptic cores taken (13 vs 2) and number of positive cores (3 vs 2) were significantly superior in the Fusion group compared to the In-bore group (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively), whilst clinical International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade was homogeneous within groups. The concordance between anterior lesions detected at biopsy and those reported in the histopathological finding of radical prostatectomy was very high, without statistically significant difference between groups.  Conclusion:   Both Fusion and In-bore GB are accurate in detecting anterior PCa, with enhanced precision detecting clinically significant tumours, as evidenced by pathologic examinations which confirmed the presence of index anterior PCa in > 50% of patients overall.

All cancers show a high degree of polygenicity, involving at a minimum of thousands of loci. We project that sample sizes required to explain 80% of GWAS heritability vary from 60,000 cases for testicular to over 1,000,000 cases for lung cancer. The maximum relative risk achievable for subjects at the 99th risk percentile of underlying polygenic risk scores (PRS), compared to average risk, ranges from 12 for testicular to 2.5 for ovarian cancer.

However, the role the neurovascular bundle (NVB) sparing plays in the rate of early continence after catheter removal remains unclear. In this study, we sought to compare the early continence rate between Retzius-sparing RARP and the retropubic approach RARP to assess whether NVB sparing affects the continence rate in patients with prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   This was a retrospective case series of 133 patients who underwent RARP from 2004 to 2017. 92 patients underwent retropubic RARP and 41 patents underwent Retzius-sparing RARP. All procedures were performed by a single surgical team in a single institution. Baseline patient characteristics were recorded and analyzed. Continence results and oncological outcomes were compared between the two groups. Continence outcome of Retzius-sparing RARP with NVB sparing was also analyzed.  Results:   No differences in age, prostate size, pathology T stage, PSA, and NVB sparing were found between the two groups. The oncological results including surgical margin and biochemical recurrence rate at one year showed no difference between the two groups. With respect to immediate continence results, the Retzius-sparing group showed a better continence result compared to the retropubic approach (75.6% vs. 26.1 %, respectively, p<0.001) after catheter removal. However, there was no difference between the two groups after 6 months. Furthermore, no significant difference in immediate continence result was found in the Retzius-sparing group between patients with NVB sparing (75 %) and those without (75 % vs. 78%, respectively, p=1.00).  Conclusion:   Retzius-sparing RARP may provide a better immediate continent result compared to retropubic RARP.

Design, setting, and participants:   A retrospective analysis of a population-based cohort of men with PCa, who underwent preoperative MRI followed by radical prostatectomy (RP) during 2014-2015 in Helsinki University Hospital (n = 346), was conducted. A tissue microarray corresponding to the MRI-visible and MRI-invisible lesions in RP specimens was constructed and stained for PTEN and ERG.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Associations of PTEN and ERG with MRI-visible and MRI-invisible lesions were examined (Pearson's χ2 test), and predictions of non-OC disease together with clinical and MRI parameters were determined (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and logistic regression analyses). BCR prediction was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard analyses.

Specifically, the potential impact of statins on PCa incidence has been studied, but solely as a ""drug family"" overlooking the distinctive pharmacological properties of its two main subgroups: hydrophilic and hydrophobic statins.  Objective:   To assess the impact of statin subgroups on PCa-specific mortality (PCSM), PCa diagnosis, and undergoing another prostate biopsy.  Design, setting, and participants:   This is a population-based cohort study in Ontario identifying all men aged ≥66 yr with a history of a single negative prostate biopsy (representing healthy men at risk for PCa) between 1994 and 2016, who were not on any of the analyzed medications prior to the study, with a median follow-up of 9.42 yr (interquartile range 8.03 yr).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Using multivariable cause-specific hazard models with time-dependent covariates, the association of hydrophobic and hydrophilic statins with all study outcomes was analyzed. Other putative chemopreventive medications (including alpha-blockers, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors, and proton-pump inhibitors), age, rurality, comorbidities, and study inclusion year were included in the models.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 21 512 men were identified. Statins were taken by 11 401 patients (50.3%), 5184 men (24.1%) were diagnosed with PCa, and 805 (3.7%) died from it. Overall, 7556 patients (35.1%) underwent another biopsy. Any use of hydrophilic statins was associated with a 32.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.9-47.5%), a 20% (95% CI 10-28%), and an 18% (95% CI 6.1-27.3%) decreased risk of PCSM, undergoing another prostate biopsy, and being diagnosed with PCa, respectively. Hydrophobic statins were associated with 17% (95% CI 2-31%) decreased PCSM. The study is limited by its retrospective nature, selection bias, and accompanying health-administrative database inaccuracies.  Conclusions:   Use of any statin may be associated with a lower hazard of PCSM, with hydrophilic statins showing a greater association with decreased PCa diagnosis rates. Preferentially prescribing one statin subgroup over another in men needs further exploration.  Patient summary:   Use of any statin may be associated with a lower probability of dying from prostate cancer.

However, a comprehensive assessment of the severity is difficult because a standardized assessment measure is unavailable. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a novel symptom score for the assessment of urinary dysfunction in HAM/TSP. We interviewed 449 patients with HAM/TSP using four internationally validated questionnaires for assessment of urinary symptoms (27 question items in total): the International Prostate Symptom Score; the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form; the Overactive Bladder Symptom Score; and the Nocturia Quality-of-Life questionnaire. We developed a symptom score based on the data of 322 patients who did not use urinary catheters by selecting question items from questionnaires focused on descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and exploratory factor analysis. The score distribution, reliability, and validity of the developed score were evaluated.  Results:   First, 16 questions related to quality of life, situations, or subjective assessment were omitted from the 27 questions. Exploratory factor analysis revealed that the remaining 11 questions pertained to three factors: frequent urination, urinary incontinence, and voiding symptoms. Three questions, which had similar questions with larger factor loading, were deleted. Finally, we selected eight question items for inclusion in the novel score. The score distribution exhibited no ceiling or floor effect. The Cronbach's alpha (0.737) demonstrated reliable internal consistency. The new score comprised two subscales with acceptable factorial validity (inter-factor correlation coefficient, 0.322): storage symptoms (frequent urination plus urinary incontinence) and voiding symptoms.

The critical clinical question is the need for a biopsy. Accurate risk stratification of patients before a biopsy can allow for individualised risk stratification thus improving clinical decision making. This study aims to build a risk calculator to inform the need for a prostate biopsy.  Methods:   Using the clinical information of 4801 patients an Irish Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator (IPRC) for diagnosis of PCa and high grade (Gleason ≥7) was created using a binary regression model including age, digital rectal examination, family history of PCa, negative prior biopsy and Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level as risk factors. The discrimination ability of the risk calculator is internally validated using cross validation to reduce overfitting, and its performance compared with PSA and the American risk calculator (PCPT), Prostate Biopsy Collaborative Group (PBCG) and European risk calculator (ERSPC) using various performance outcome summaries. In a subgroup of 2970 patients, prostate volume was included. Separate risk calculators including the prostate volume (IPRCv) for the diagnosis of PCa (and high-grade PCa) was created.  Results:   IPRC area under the curve (AUC) for the prediction of PCa and high-grade PCa was 0.6741 (95% CI, 0.6591 to 0.6890) and 0.7214 (95% CI, 0.7018 to 0.7409) respectively. This significantly outperforms the predictive ability of cancer detection for PSA (0.5948), PCPT (0.6304), PBCG (0.6528) and ERSPC (0.6502) risk calculators; and also, for detecting high-grade cancer for PSA (0.6623) and PCPT (0.6804) but there was no significant improvement for PBCG (0.7185) and ERSPC (0.7140). The inclusion of prostate volume into the risk calculator significantly improved the AUC for cancer detection (AUC = 0.7298; 95% CI, 0.7119 to 0.7478), but not for high-grade cancer (AUC = 0.7256; 95% CI, 0.7017 to 0.7495). The risk calculator also demonstrated an increased net benefit on decision curve analysis.  Conclusion:   The risk calculator developed has advantages over prior risk stratification of prostate cancer patients before the biopsy. It will reduce the number of men requiring a biopsy and their exposure to its side effects. The interactive tools developed are beneficial to translate the risk calculator into practice and allows for clarity in the clinical recommendations.""","""['Amirhossein Jalali', 'Robert W Foley', 'Robert M Maweni', 'Keefe Murphy', 'Dara J Lundon', 'Thomas Lynch', 'Richard Power', ""Frank O'Brien"", ""Kieran J O'Malley"", 'David J Galvin', 'Garrett C Durkan', 'T Brendan Murphy', 'R William Watson']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Med Inform Decis Mak""","""['European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) risk calculators significantly outperform the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) 2.0 in the prediction of prostate cancer: a multi-institutional study.', 'Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator Apps in a Taiwanese Population Cohort: Validation Study.', 'Prediction of prostate cancer risk: the role of prostate volume and digital rectal examination in the ERSPC risk calculators.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Do prostate cancer risk models improve the predictive accuracy of PSA screening?

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) regulate biological processes in a variety of cancers, but the precise roles of circRNAs in PCa are poorly understood. Herein, we identified a novel circRNA, termed circMBOAT2 (has_circ_0007334), which was significantly overexpressed in PCa tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of circMBOAT2 was associated with high Gleason score, advanced pathological T stage, and poor prognosis. Overexpression of circMBOAT2 promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion of PCa cells in vitro, and enhanced tumorigenesis and metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, circMBOAT2 overexpression upregulated the expression of mTOR by acting as a decoy for miR-1271-5p, resulting in the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, ultimately promoting the progression of PCa. Importantly, application of an inhibitor of mTOR significantly antagonized circMBOAT2-mediated PCa tumorigenesis in vivo. circMBOAT2 promotes proliferation and metastasis of PCa through miR-1271-5p/mTOR axis-mediated activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway.

Decreased PTPN14 expression was detected in prostate cancer, and restoration of PTPN14 expression in prostate cancer cells inhibited the proliferative and invasive potential. Mechanistically, PTPN14 increased the phosphorylation of Yes-associated protein (YAP) by activation of large tumor suppressor 1 (LATS1), an action that resulted in a significant reduction in YAP-mediated transcriptional activity. Inactivation of YAP by its inhibitor markedly abrogated the PTPN14-knockdown-induced promotion effect on prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Notably, PTPN14 up-regulation also exerted a remarkable suppressive impact on tumorigenesis of prostate cancer in vivo.

Thus, modulation of these interlinked growth pathways along with androgen ablation may provide attractive therapeutic benefits. The current research is focused to identify the inhibitors of these pathways with bacosides and Piperine.

The in-vitro cytotoxic study against PC3 cell lines showed dose-dependent effect of Piperine and the extract. Further, in silico docking has shown bacosides with significant molecular interactions and binding score with growth factor receptors such as EGFR, PI3K, Akt and ERK, whereas Piperine exhibited interactions with AR. Hence, a simultaneous downregulation of interlinked signaling pathways of growth factors and AR with bacosides and Piperine may produce effective cytotoxic potential against the androgen-independent prostate cancer.

Due to the ""vicious cycle"" of cancer cells inducing bone resorption, which promotes further tumor growth, they are difficult to treat and may lead to extreme pain. These factors increase the urgency for emerging therapeutics that target bone metastases more specifically and effectively. Animal studies are essential to the development of any therapeutics, but also require robust animal models of human diseases. Robust animal models are often challenging to develop in the case of bone metastasis studies. Previous methods to induce bone metastasis include intracardiac, intravenous, subcutaneous via mammary fat pad, and intraosseous cancer cell injections, but these methods all have limitations. By contrast, the caudal artery route of injection offers more robust bone metastasis, while also resulting in a lower rate of vital organ metastases than that of other routes of tumor implantation. A syngeneic animal model of bone metastasis is necessary in many cancer studies, because it allows the use of immunocompetent animals, which more accurately mimic cancer development observed in immunocompetent humans. Here we present a detailed method to generate robust and easily monitored 4T1-CLL1 syngeneic bone metastases with over 95% occurrence in BALB/c mice, within two weeks.

It is unclear whether this effect may be harnessed by combining immunotherapy with radiotherapy fractions used to treat prostate cancer. We investigated tumour immune microenvironment responses of pre-clinical prostate cancer models to radiotherapy. Having defined this landscape, we tested whether radiotherapy-induced tumour growth delay could be enhanced with anti-PD-L1.  Methods:   Hypofractionated radiotherapy was delivered to TRAMP-C1 and MyC-CaP flank allografts. Tumour growth delay, tumour immune microenvironment flow-cytometry, and immune gene expression were analysed. TRAMP-C1 allografts were then treated with 3 × 5 Gy ± anti-PD-L1.  Results:   3 × 5 Gy caused tumour growth delay in TRAMP-C1 and MyC-CaP. Tumour immune microenvironment changes in TRAMP-C1 at 7 days post-radiotherapy included increased tumour-associated macrophages and dendritic cells and upregulation of PD-1/PD-L1, CD8+ T-cell, dendritic cell, and regulatory T-cell genes. At tumour regrowth post-3 × 5 Gy the tumour immune microenvironment flow-cytometry was similar to control tumours, however CD8+, natural killer and dendritic cell gene transcripts were reduced. PD-L1 inhibition plus 3 × 5 Gy in TRAMP-C1 did not enhance tumour growth delay versus monotherapy.  Conclusion:   3 × 5 Gy hypofractionated radiotherapy can result in tumour growth delay and immune cell changes in allograft prostate cancer models.

We aimed to identify subgroups within a Stockholm population with PC risk profiles matching American ethnicity-specific subgroups and compare the detection of PC and describe Stockholm3 performance within these subgroups.  Methods:   All men age 49-70 years presenting for prostate biopsies were evaluated at UIC from 2016 to 2019, as well as men in Stockholm from 2012 to 2014 in the STHLM3 study. Propensity scores (PS) were estimated for each person using logistic regression for age, PSA, prostate volume, family history of PC, 5-alpha reductase inhibitor use, and prior biopsy. 3:1 PS matching was performed for Stockholm to Chicago ethnicity-specific cohorts and odds ratios (OR) were computed to compare detection of GG ≥ 2 PC between groups.  Results:   504 Chicago men and 6980 Stockholm men were included. In African American (AA) men, 51% had GG ≥ 2 PC detected, while in risk-matched Stockholm men, 34% had GG ≥ 2 PC detected (OR: 2.1, p < 0.001). There was no statistical difference in GG ≥ 2 PC detected when matching Stockholm men to non-Hispanic Caucasian men (31% vs. 24%, OR: 0.7, p = 0.30) or Hispanic Caucasian men (31% vs. 27%, OR: 1.2, p = 0.42). The AUC for the Stockholm3 test of the matched Stockholm cohorts for AA, non-Hispanic Caucasian, and Hispanic Caucasian men was 0.85, 0.89, and 0.90, respectively.  Conclusions:   Using statistical techniques to simulate a multi-ethnic Chicago cohort within the STHLM3 population, we found an excess risk of GG ≥ 2 PC among AA men.

Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has been used in the oligometastatic setting, and provides an ablative approach ideal for reirradiation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes after SBRT reirradiation of extraosseous recurrences in the pelvis.  Materials and methods:   This single institution retrospective study evaluated patients treated with SBRT reirradiation in the pelvis from January 2011 to February 2018. Patients with more than five oligometastatic lesions, >7 cm in size, and recurrence within the prostate were excluded.  Results:   In total, 30 patients were treated with SBRT with a median follow-up of 29.4 months. The primary tumour sites were most commonly rectum (30.8%) and prostate (30.8%). The median time interval between irradiation for the primary and SBRT reirradiation was 48 months (3-245). The typical reirradiation treatment was 35 Gy in five fractions, the median gross tumour volume size was 10.2 (0.3-110.5) ml and the most common target was the iliac nodes (40%). There were three (10%) acute grade 3 toxicities and no late grade 3 or more toxicities. At 12/24 months, local relapse-free survival, metastasis-free survival, progression-free survival and overall survival were 67.7%/50.7%, 67%/41.7%, 34.8%/14.9% and 83.2%/62.5%, respectively. On univariate analysis, improved local control was associated with low gross tumour volume (<10 ml) (P = 0.003) and prostate primary (P = 0.02), but was no longer significant on multivariate analysis. The proximity of organ at risk to the target did not significantly correlate with worse toxicity (P = 0.14) or tumour coverage (gross tumour volume: P = 0.8, planning target volume: P = 0.4).

Given the ever increasing number of cancer survivors, in general, and prostate cancer survivors, in particular, there is a need for a more sustainable model of follow-up care. Currently, patients who have completed primary treatment for localized prostate cancer are often included in a specialist-based follow-up care program. General practitioners already play a key role in providing continuous and comprehensive health care. Studies in breast and colorectal cancer suggest that general practitioners could also consider to provide survivorship care in prostate cancer. However, empirical data are needed to determine whether follow-up care of localized prostate cancer survivors by the general practitioner is a feasible alternative.  Methods:   This multicenter, randomized, non-inferiority study will compare specialist-based (usual care) versus general practitioner-based (intervention) follow-up care of prostate cancer survivors who have completed primary treatment (prostatectomy or radiotherapy) for localized prostate cancer. Patients are being recruited from hospitals in the Netherlands, and randomly (1:1) allocated to specialist-based (N = 195) or general practitioner-based (N = 195) follow-up care. This trial will evaluate the effectiveness of primary care-based follow-up, in comparison to usual care, in terms of adherence to the prostate cancer surveillance guideline for the timing and frequency of prostate-specific antigen assessments, the time from a biochemical recurrence to retreatment decision-making, the management of treatment-related side effects, health-related quality of life, prostate cancer-related anxiety, continuity of care, and cost-effectiveness. The outcome measures will be assessed at randomization (≤6 months after treatment), and 12, 18, and 24 months after treatment.  Discussion:   This multicenter, prospective, randomized study will provide empirical evidence regarding the (cost-) effectiveness of specialist-based follow-up care compared to general practitioner-based follow-up care for localized prostate cancer survivors.

Zeb1 and SK3 channel were strongly upregulated by hypoxia both in vitro and ex vivo in organotypic cultures of human PCa. Taking into account the sensitivity of the SK3 channel to the membrane lipid composition, we identified lipids such as Ohmline (an alkyl ether lipid and SK3 inhibitor), linoleic acid (LA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (fatty acids associated with indolent PCa), which were able to completely abrogate the hypoxia-induced changes in Zeb1 expression.

In this work, we used a bioinformatics approach to address the biological significance of HO-1 interactors. Open-access PCa datasets were mined to address the clinical significance of the HO-1 interactome in human samples. HO-1 interactors were clustered into groups according to their expression profile in PCa patients. We focused on the myxovirus resistance gene (MX1) as: (1) it was significantly upregulated under HO-1 induction; (2) it was the most consistently downregulated gene in PCa vs. normal prostate; (3) its loss was associated with decreased relapse-free survival in PCa; and (4) there was a significant positive correlation between MX1 and HMOX1 in PCa patients. Further, MX1 was upregulated in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), and this stress triggered apoptosis and autophagy in PCa cells. Strikingly, MX1 silencing reversed ERS.

However, current computer-aided technologies are mostly focused on single-needle digitization, while manual digitization is labor intensive and time consuming. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based workflow for fast automatic multi-needle digitization, including needle shaft detection and needle tip detection. The major workflow is composed of two components: a large margin mask R-CNN model (LMMask R-CNN), which adopts the lager margin loss to reformulate Mask R-CNN for needle shaft localization, and a needle based density-based spatial clustering of application with noise algorithm which integrates priors to model a needle in an iteration for a needle shaft refinement and tip detections. Besides, we use the skipping connection in neural network architecture to improve the supervision in hidden layers. Our workflow was evaluated on 23 patients who underwent US-guided high-dose-rate (HDR) prostrate brachytherapy with 339 needles being tested in total. Our method detected 98% of the needles with 0.091 ± 0.043 mm shaft error and 0.330 ± 0.363 mm tip error. Compared with only using Mask R-CNN and only using LMMask R-CNN, the proposed method gains a significant improvement on both shaft error and tip error. The proposed method automatically digitizes needles per patient with in a second.

Summary scores for EPIC subscales are calculated by averaging patient scores for attributes (e.g., side effects), implying equal weighting of the attributes in the absence of evidence showing otherwise.  Methods:   We estimated patient preferences for each of the attributes included in the bowel subscale of the EPIC instrument using best-worst (B-W) scaling among a cohort of men with prostate cancer. Patients were presented with multiple tasks in which they were asked to indicate which attribute they would find most and least bothersome at different levels of severity. Analysis utilized both (simple) B-W counts and scores to estimate patient preferences for each attribute as well as attribute levels.  Results:   A total of 174 respondents from two institutions participated in the survey. Preference estimates for each of the five attributes included in the EPIC-26 bowel subscale showed wide variation preferences: 'losing control of bowel movements' was found to be the most bothersome attribute, with a B-W score of -0.48, followed by bowel urgency which also had negative B-W score (-0.04). Increased frequency of bowel movements was the least bothersome attribute, with a B-W score of +0.33, followed by bloody stools (+0.12), and pelvic/rectal pain (+0.06). Analysis of preference weights for attribute bother levels showed preference estimates be linear.  Conclusions:   We provide novel evidence on patient preferences for side effect reduction following prostate radiotherapy. Within the bowel sub-scale of the EPIC-26 short form, we found that bowel incontinence was perceived to be the most bothersome treatment effect, while increased bowel frequency was least bothersome to patients.""","""['Mark V Mishra', 'Winter Maxwell Thayer', 'Ellen Janssen', 'Bradford Hoppe', 'Caitlin Eggleston', 'John F P Bridges']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Multinational Prospective Study of Patient-Reported Outcomes After Prostate Radiation Therapy: Detailed Assessment of Rectal Bleeding.', 'Cross validation of the prostate cancer radiotherapy late toxicity (PCRT) questionnaire with the expanded prostate cancer index composite (EPIC) instrument.', 'Multi-institutional prospective evaluation of bowel quality of life after prostate external beam radiation therapy identifies patient and treatment factors associated with patient-reported outcomes: the PROSTQA experience.', 'Quality of life study in prostate cancer patients treated with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy: comparing late bowel and bladder quality of life symptoms to that of the normal population.', 'A systematic review of expanded prostate cancer index composite (EPIC) quality of life after surgery or radiation treatment.', ""Men's perceptions and preferences regarding prostate cancer radiation therapy: A systematic scoping review.""]"""

We analyzed life course BMI trajectories on prostate cancer risk based on data from the Epidemiological study of Prostate Cancer (EPICAP). We included in our analyses 781 incident prostate cancer cases and 829 controls frequency matched by age. Participants were asked about their weight every decade from age 20 to two years before reference date. BMI trajectories were determined using group-based trajectory modeling to identify groups of men with similar patterns of BMI changes. We identified five BMI trajectories groups. Men with a normal BMI at age 20 developing overweight or obesity during adulthood were at increased risk of aggressive prostate cancer compared to men who maintained a normal BMI. Our results suggest that BMI trajectories resulting in overweight or obesity during adulthood are associated with an increased risk of aggressive prostate cancer, particularly in never smokers, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a healthy BMI throughout adulthood.""","""['Céline Lavalette', 'Emilie Cordina Duverger', 'Fanny Artaud', 'Xavier Rébillard', 'Pierre-Jean Lamy', 'Brigitte Trétarre', 'Sylvie Cénée', 'Florence Menegaux']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""[]"""

Thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) is downregulated in a variety of human tumors and plays an important role in tumor suppression. However, the expression level and biological functions of TXNIP in PCa have not been identified yet. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the expression and biological functions of TXNIP in PCa. We reported that the expression of TXNIP was significantly decreased in PCa and associated with clinicopathological features. Overexpression of TXNIP could significantly inhibited PC-3 cells proliferation, migration, invasion, and glucose uptake. Additionally, overexpression of TXNIP could remarkably block cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase and promoted cell apoptosis. Furthermore, TXNIP expression correlated inversely with GLUT1 expression in PCa. Taken together, our results for the first time revealed that TXNIP was decreased in PCa. Moreover, TXNIP might act as a tumor suppressor of PCa and correlated with tumor occurrence and development. Our findings cast a new light on better understanding the occurrence and development of PCa and indicated that TXNIP might be favorable for PCa molecular target therapy.""","""['Ming Xie', 'Ruiyan Xie', 'Sen Xie', 'Yiyi Wu', 'Wei Wang', 'Xiang Li', 'Yuanyu Xu', 'Bo Liu', 'Yu Zhou', 'Tao Wang', 'Lei Gao', 'Tiejun Pan']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cell Biol Int""","""['Knockdown of RNF2 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells through the upregulation of TXNIP.', 'Tumor-Suppressive Function of miR-30d-5p in Prostate Cancer Cell Proliferation and Migration by Targeting NT5E.', 'SOCS6 Functions as a Tumor Suppressor by Inducing Apoptosis and Inhibiting Angiogenesis in Human Prostate Cancer.', 'Research Progress of TXNIP as a Tumor Suppressor Gene Participating in the Metabolic Reprogramming and Oxidative Stress of Cancer Cells in Various Cancers.', 'Roles of thioredoxin binding protein (TXNIP) in oxidative stress, apoptosis and cancer.', 'GADD45A and GADD45B as Novel Biomarkers Associated with Chromatin Regulators in Renal Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury.', 'Connexins and Glucose Metabolism in Cancer.', 'ADAMTS10 inhibits aggressiveness via JAK/STAT/c-MYC pathway and reprograms macrophage to create an anti-malignant microenvironment in gastric cancer.', 'MIR99AHG/miR-204-5p/TXNIP/Nrf2/ARE Signaling Pathway Decreases Glioblastoma Temozolomide Sensitivity.', 'Physiological and Pathophysiological Roles of Thioredoxin Interacting Protein: A Perspective on Redox Inflammation and Metabolism.']"""

Methods and results:   We retrieved 19 tumours with one or more variant(s), and performed ERG immunohistochemistry, a next-generation sequencing assay targeting recurrent gene fusions, and fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH) for ERG and BRAF. Divergent differentiation included: sarcomatoid carcinoma (n = 10), adenosquamous carcinoma (n = 7), and pleomorphic giant-cell carcinoma (n = 7). Five patients had more than one variant. Four had variants only in metastases. ERG rearrangement was detected in nine (47%, seven via sequencing, showing TMPRSS2-ERG fusions and one GRHL2-ERG fusion, and two via FISH, showing rearrangement via deletion). ERG was immunohistochemically positive in the adenocarcinoma in eight of nine (89%) patients, but was immunohistochemically positive in the variant in only five of nine patients (56%, typically decreased). One patient had a false-positive ERG immunohistochemical result in the sarcomatoid component despite a negative FISH result. Two (11%) harboured BRAF fusions (FAM131A-BRAF and SND1-BRAF).  Conclusions:   ERG fusions are present in these rare prostate cancer variants with a frequency close to that in conventional prostate cancer (9/19, 47%). ERG immunohistochemistry usually detects rearrangement in the adenocarcinoma, but is less sensitive for the variant histology, with weak to negative staining. Adenosquamous and sarcomatoid variants can, particularly, occur together. Molecular assessment may be an additional tool in selected cases to confirm the prostatic origin of unusual tumours. The presence of two BRAF rearrangements suggests that this gene fusion may be enriched in this setting, as RAF kinase fusions have been previously reported in 1-2% of prostate cancers.""","""['Mohamed Alhamar', 'I Tudor Vladislav', 'Steven C Smith', 'Yuan Gao', 'Liang Cheng', 'Laura A Favazza', 'Ali M Alani', 'Michael M Ittmann', 'Nicole D Riddle', 'Lisa J Whiteley', 'Nilesh S Gupta', 'Shannon Carskadon', 'Juan C Gomez-Gelvez', 'Dhananjay A Chitale', 'Nallasivam Palanisamy', 'Ondrej Hes', 'Kiril Trpkov', 'Sean R Williamson']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Histopathology""","""['Frequent TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement in prostatic small cell carcinoma detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization: the superiority of fluorescence in situ hybridization over ERG immunohistochemistry.', 'Gene fusions between TMPRSS2 and ETS family genes in prostate cancer: frequency and transcript variant analysis by RT-PCR and FISH on paraffin-embedded tissues.', 'TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement in dominant anterior prostatic tumours: incidence and correlation with ERG immunohistochemistry.', 'Clinical applications of novel ERG immunohistochemistry in prostate cancer diagnosis and management.', 'TMPRSS2:ERG Gene Fusions in Prostate Cancer of West African Men and a Meta-Analysis of Racial Differences.', 'Pleomorphic giant cell carcinoma of the prostate: clinicopathologic analysis and oncological outcomes.', 'The Role of Histology-Agnostic Drugs in the Treatment of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Genomic analysis of circulating tumor cells in adenosquamous carcinoma of the prostate: a case report.']"""

However, literature is scarce regarding the impact of this pathway, alone or combined with prehabilitation (PreHab) programs, on outcomes after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).  Methods:   Included in this study were 507 consecutive patients undergoing RARP from 2014 to 2019. The primary endpoint was duration of hospital stay. Secondary outcomes included intraoperative blood loss, operative duration, readmission rate, and overall costs. Univariate and multivariate comparisons were performed according to the ERAS and PreHab program status.  Results:   ERAS patients had shorter hospital stays (P < .001), reduced operative times (P < .001), and decreased blood loss (P < .001) in comparison with non-ERAS patients. Shorter hospital stays were not associated with an increased readmission rate (7.9% [stable over time]; P = .757). Patients from an ERAS-/PreHab- group had a longer hospital stay (4.7 days) than those from an ERAS+/PreHab- group (3.5 days) and those from an ERAS+/PreHab+ group (1.6 days; P < .001). In a multivariate analysis, operative time and perioperative pathway (odds ratio for ERAS, 0.144; P < .001; odds ratio for ERAS and PreHab, 0.025; P < .001) were independently predictive for a prolonged length of stay (P < .001). Costs significantly decreased when ERAS and PreHab pathways were combined.  Conclusions:   The implementation of ERAS and PreHab programs significantly changes the postoperative course of patients and may synergistically optimize RARP outcomes. The combination of these pathways improves patient recovery and is associated with reduced lengths of stay, blood loss, operative times, and costs without an increase in the postdischarge readmission rate.""","""['Guillaume Ploussard', 'Christophe Almeras', 'Jean-Baptiste Beauval', 'Jean-Romain Gautier', 'Valérie Garnault', 'Natacha Frémont', 'Stéphanie Dallemagne', 'Guillaume Loison', 'Ambroise Salin', 'Christophe Tollon']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['A prehabilitation programme implemented before robot-assisted radical prostatectomy improves peri-operative outcomes and continence recovery.', 'Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathway optimizes outcomes and costs for minimally invasive radical prostatectomy.', 'Prehabilitation programs and ERAS protocols in gynecological oncology: a comprehensive review.', 'Same-day discharge surgery for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in the era of ERAS and prehabilitation pathways: a contemporary, comparative, feasibility study.', 'Comparison of perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes between standard laparoscopic and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systemic review and meta-analysis.', 'Multimodal prehabilitation in patients with non-small cell lung cancer undergoing anatomical resection: protocol of a non-randomised feasibility study.', 'Cost-effectiveness of prehabilitation prior to elective surgery: a systematic review of economic evaluations.', 'Robotic approach together with an enhanced recovery programme improve the perioperative outcomes for complex hepatectomy.', 'Multimodal prehabilitation for major surgery in elderly patients to lower complications: protocol of a randomised, prospective, multicentre, multidisciplinary trial (PREHABIL Trial).', 'Framework, component, and implementation of enhanced recovery pathways.']"""

Methods:   We examined information on 661 incident histologically verified colorectal cancer cases and 1,322 controls from Barcelona and Madrid, 2007-2013. Outdoor ALAN exposure was based on images from the International Space Station (ISS) including data on remotely sensed upward light intensity. We derived adjusted odds ratio (OR) estimates and confidence intervals (CI) for visual light, blue light, and spectral sensitivities of the five human photopigments assigned to participant's geocoded longest residence.  Results:   Exposure to blue light spectrum was positively associated with colorectal cancer (OR = 1.6; 95% CI: 1.2-2.2; highest vs. lowest tertile). ORs were similar (OR = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.3-2.3) when further adjusting for area socioeconomic status, diet patterns, smoking, sleep, and family history. We observed no association for outdoor visual light (full spectrum) (OR = 1.0; 95% CI, 0.7-1.2; highest vs. lowest tertile). Analysis of the five photopigments gave similar results with increased risks for shorter wavelengths overlapping with the blue spectrum and no association for longer wavelengths.

The purpose of this study is to assess the associations between religious coping and quality of life among black and white men with prostate cancer. Data for this investigation were drawn from the Diagnosis and Decisions in Prostate Cancer Treatment Outcomes Study that consisted of 624 black and white men with complete information on the primary outcome and predictor variables. The primary outcome for this study was overall quality of life as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate questionnaire. The main independent variable was religious coping measured by 2 subscales capturing positive and negative forms of coping. Black men in the study had lower overall quality of life scores (134.6 ± 19.6) than their white peers (139.8 ± 14.1). Black men in the sample also had higher average positive religious coping scores (12.9 ± 3.3) than white men (10.3 ± 4.5). Fully adjusted linear regression models of the total sample produced results indicating that positive religious coping was correlated with an increase in quality of life (β = .38, standard error [SE] = 0.18, P < .05). Negative religious coping was associated with a reduction in quality of life (β = -1.48, SE = 0.40, P < .001).

However, outcomes of cancer in transplant recipients compared with non-transplant recipients are less well studied. We aim to study the survival in kidney transplant recipients who develop cancer and compare this with cancer outcomes in the general population.  Methods:   We linked data from the National Cancer Registry Ireland with the National Kidney Transplant Database. The period of observation was from 1 January 1994 until 31 December 2014. Transplant recipients were considered at risk from the time of diagnosing cancer. We administratively censored data at 10 years post-cancer diagnosis. Survival was compared with all patients in the general population that had a recorded diagnosis of cancer.  Results:   There were 907 renal transplant recipients and 426679 individuals in the general population diagnosed with cancer between 1 January 1994 and 31 December 2014. In those with non-melanoma skin cancer, the hazard ratio (HR) for 10-year, all-cause mortality [HR = 3.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.66-3.52] and cancer-specific mortality (HR = 3.91, 95% CI 2.57-5.96) was significantly higher among transplant recipients than the general population. Patients who developed non-Hodgkin lymphoma (HR = 2.89, 95% CI 1.96-4.25) and prostate cancer (HR = 4.32, 95% CI 2.39-7.82) had increased all-cause but not cancer-specific mortality. Colorectal, lung, breast and renal cell cancer did not show an increased risk of death in transplant recipients.  Conclusion:   Cancer-attributable mortality is higher in kidney transplant recipients with non-melanoma skin cancer compared with non-transplant patients.

The cytotoxicity of 1 and 2 was screened against human liver carcinoma (Huh7), prostate cancer (Du145), and the normal prostate cell line (PNT 2). The results implicated a dose-dependent growth inhibition of the two cancer cells at concentrations (2.5-15 μM) of 1 and 2 with the treatment after 48 h.

Methods:   Between March 2017 and July 2019, subjects meeting eligibility criteria for partial gland cryoablation were enrolled into an IRB approved outcomes registry. PSA, mpMRI, and prostate biopsy (four cores targeting the ablation zone + six ipsilateral systematic cores) were performed per protocol 6 months following intervention. Binary logistic regression was employed to calculate odds ratio (OR) of PSA decrease, and suspicious mpMRI effect on cancer persistence. The performance of mpMRI for predicting in-field persistence of PCa was evaluated by area under the receiver operation characteristics curve (AUC).  Results:   Of the 83 eligible men undergoing partial gland cryoablation, 70 (84.3%) underwent 6-month protocol prostate biopsy. Five (7.1%) biopsies exhibited any in-field disease persistence.

Innovative therapies for mCRPC are needed; however, the development of new therapies relies on accurate imaging to assess metastasis and monitor response. Standard imaging modalities for prostate cancer require improvement and there remains a need for selective and sensitive imaging probes that can be widely used in patients with mCRPC.  Experimental design:   We evaluated the transmembrane protease fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP) as a targetable cell surface antigen for mCRPC. Genomic and IHC analyses were performed to investigate FAP expression in prostate cancer. Our FAP-targeted antibody imaging probe, [89Zr]Zr-B12 IgG, was evaluated by PET/CT imaging in preclinical prostate cancer models.  Results:   Analysis of patient data documented FAP overexpression in metastatic disease across tumor subtypes. PET imaging with [89Zr]Zr-B12 IgG demonstrated high tumor uptake and long-term retention of the probe in the preclinical models examined. FAP-positive stroma tumor uptake of [89Zr]Zr-B12 IgG was 5-fold higher than the isotype control with mean %ID/cc of 34.13 ± 1.99 versus 6.12 ± 2.03 (n = 3/group; P = 0.0006) at 72 hours. Ex vivo biodistribution corroborated these results documenting rapid blood clearance by 24 hours and high tumor uptake of [89Zr]Zr-B12 IgG by 72 hours.

DNA damage repair (DDR) defective prostate cancers, specifically genetic aberrations leading to homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), accumulate irreparable DNA damage following genotoxic treatment. This retrospective study assessed DDR mutation status in patients treated with radium-223, investigating their association with efficacy and overall survival (OS).  Patients and methods:   Included patients were treated with radium-223 and had results from primary or metastatic tumour tissue of a comprehensive next-generation sequencing panel of DDR genes, including canonical HRD genes. Patients were grouped by presence (DDR+) or absence (DDR-) of pathogenic somatic or germline aberrations in DDR genes. We evaluated OS, time to ALP progression (TAP), time to initiation of subsequent systemic therapy (TST) and biochemical responses between DDR groups.  Results:   Ninety-three patients were included. Twenty-eight (30%) patients had DDR mutations, most frequently in ATM (8.6%), BRCA2 (7.5%) and CDK12 (4.3%) genes. DDR+ patients showed prolonged OS (median 36.3 versus 17.0 months; HR 2.29; P = 0.01).

Methods and materials:   Two hundred 3-dimensional (3D) preimplant and postimplant prostate brachytherapy MRI scans were acquired with a T2-weighted sequence, a T2/T1-weighted sequence, or a T1-weighted sequence. One hundred twenty deep machine learning models were trained to segment the prostate, seminal vesicles, external urinary sphincter, rectum, and bladder using the MRI scans acquired with T2-weighted and T2/T1-weighted image contrast. The deep machine learning models consisted of 18 fully convolutional networks (FCNs) with different convolutional encoders. Both 2-dimensional and 3D U-Net FCNs were constructed for comparison. Six objective functions were investigated: cross-entropy, Jaccard distance, focal loss, and 3 variations of Tversky distance. The performance of the models was compared using similarity metrics, including pixel accuracy, Jaccard index, Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), 95% Hausdorff distance, relative volume difference, Matthews correlation coefficient, precision, recall, and average symmetrical surface distance. We selected the highest-performing architecture and investigated how the amount of training data, use of skip connections, and data augmentation affected segmentation performance.

Immunohistochemical stainings for PTEN and ERG expression were conducted on biopsies and RP TMAs and results were compared by using Fisher's exact test.  Results:   The immunohistochemical predictive power of FBx, determined by the concordance of biopsy PTEN and ERG status with RP, is superior to SBx (77.6% vs 66.7% in PTEN, 92.4% vs 66.6% in ERG). FBx was superior to SBx in correlation with RP Gleason Grade Groups and MRI prostate imaging reporting and data system scores.  Conclusion:   FBx grading correlates with RP histology and MRI findings and predicts the biomarker status in the RP specimens more accurately than SBx. A longer follow-up is needed to evaluate if this translates to better prediction of disease outcomes, especially in AS and radiation therapy where prostatectomy specimens are not available for prognostication.""","""['Andrew M Erickson', 'Utku Lokman', 'Kanerva Lahdensuo', 'Sara Tornberg', 'Harri Visapaa', 'Robin Bergroth', 'Henrikki Santti', 'Anssi Petas', 'Antti S Rannikko', 'Tuomas Mirtti']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['PTEN Loss but Not ERG Expression in Diagnostic Biopsies Is Associated with Increased Risk of Progression and Adverse Surgical Findings in Men with Prostate Cancer on Active Surveillance.', 'Postoperative change in Gleason score of prostate cancer in fusion targeted biopsy: a matched pair analysis.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-transectal ultrasound image-fusion biopsies accurately characterize the index tumor: correlation with step-sectioned radical prostatectomy specimens in 135 patients.', 'Techniques and Outcomes of MRI-TRUS Fusion Prostate Biopsy.', 'Association Between ERG/PTEN Genes and Pathologic Parameters of Prostate Cancer With an Emphasis on Gleason Score: A Literature Review.', 'Molecular Mechanism of the Regulatory Effect of Schisandrol A on the Immune Function of Mice Based on a Transcription Factor Regulatory Network.']"""

Emerging evidence indicates that t-NEPC can develop when prostate adenocarcinoma cells acquire cancer stem-like cell signaling in the presence of androgen receptor inhibition, followed by redifferentiation toward neuroendocrine lineage and subsequent t-NEPC progression. Whether the stem-like signaling is controlled by the core pluripotency stem cell genes (e.g., LIN28 and SOX2) remains unknown. Here, we report that the transcription of the LIN28B isoform and SOX2 were co-upregulated in t-NEPC patient tumors, patient-derived xenografts, transgenic mice, and cell models. Immunohistochemistry validated that LIN28B and SOX2 protein expression were elevated in t-NEPC patient biopsies. Using prostate adenocarcinoma and t-NEPC cell models, we demonstrated that LIN28B induced a stem-like gene network, neuroendocrine biomarkers, and neuroendocrine cell morphology. LIN28B depletion by CRISPR inhibited t-NEPC tumorigenesis and xenograft growth. These LIN28B functions were mediated mainly through the suppression of let-7 miRNA expression, resulting in de-repression of the transcription factor HMGA2 and HMGA2-mediated SOX2 expression. This study revealed a mechanism by which t-NEPC can develop through the LIN28B/let-7/SOX2 axis that regulates a cancer cell stem-like gene network, highlighting LIN28B as a potential therapeutic target in t-NEPC.""","""['Jessica Lovnicki', 'Yu Gan', 'Tingting Feng', 'Yinan Li', 'Ning Xie', 'Chia-Hao Ho', 'Ahn R Lee', 'Xufeng Chen', 'Lucia Nappi', 'Bo Han', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Jiaoti Huang', 'Martin E Gleave', 'Xuesen Dong']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Clin Invest""","""['A novel mechanism of SRRM4 in promoting neuroendocrine prostate cancer development via a pluripotency gene network.', 'SOX2 has dual functions as a regulator in the progression of neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Lin28B/Let-7 Regulates Expression of Oct4 and Sox2 and Reprograms Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cells to a Stem-like State.', 'LIN28/LIN28B: an emerging oncogenic driver in cancer stem cells.', 'The role of epigenetics and long noncoding RNA MIAT in neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'A bibliometric study of the top 100 most-cited papers in neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Placental Galectins in Cancer: Why We Should Pay More Attention.', 'Targeting Lin28 axis enhances glypican-3-CAR T\xa0cell efficacy against hepatic tumor initiating cell population.', 'Discovery of Novel Lin28 Inhibitors to Suppress Cancer Cell Stemness.', 'Lin28 Regulates Cancer Cell Stemness for Tumour Progression.']"""

The incidence, prevalence, and outcomes of these systemic malignancies with bone metastases were then analyzed.  Results:   A total of 67,605 patients with bone metastases at cancer diagnosis were included. The highest rate of bone metastases was observed in patients with small-cell lung cancer at the time of alternative primary site cancer diagnosis. Among 226,816 cases with metastatic disease, cases with breast cancer (65.58%), and prostate cancer (89.60%) had a high incidence proportion (>10%) of identified bone metastases.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen PET agents such as 2-(3-{1-carboxy-5-[(6-[18F]fluoro-pyridine 3-carbonyl)-amino]-pentyl}-ureido)-pentanedioic acid (18F-DCFPyL) may improve detection of recurrence compared with multiparametric MRI; however, histopathologic validation is lacking. Purpose To determine the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV) of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT based on histologic analysis and to compare with pelvic multiparametric MRI in men with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer. Materials and Methods Men were prospectively recruited after prostatectomy and/or radiation therapy with rising prostate-specific antigen level (median, 2.27 ng/mL; range, 0.2-27.45 ng/mL) and a negative result at conventional imaging (bone scan and/or CT). Participants underwent 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging and 3.0-T pelvic multiparametric MRI. Statistical analysis included Wald and modified χ2 tests. Results A total of 323 lesions were visualized in 77 men by using 18F-DCFPyL or multiparametric MRI, with imaging detection concordance of 25% (82 of 323) when including all lesions in the MRI field of view and 53% (52 of 99) when only assessing prostate bed lesions. 18F-DCFPyL depicted more pelvic lymph nodes than did MRI (128 vs 23 nodes). Histologic validation was obtained in 80 locations with sensitivity, specificity, and PPV of 69% (25 of 36; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 51%, 88%), 91% (40 of 44; 95% CI: 74%, 98%), and 86% (25 of 29; 95% CI: 73%, 97%) for 18F-DCFPyL and 69% (24 of 35; 95% CI: 50%, 86%), 74% (31 of 42; 95% CI: 42%, 89%), and 69% (24 of 35; 95% CI: 50%, 88%) for multiparametric MRI (P = .95, P = .14, and P = .07, respectively). In the prostate bed, sensitivity, specificity, and PPV were 57% (13 of 23; 95% CI: 32%, 81%), 86% (18 of 21; 95% CI: 73%, 100%), and 81% (13 of 16; 95% CI: 59%, 100%) for 18F-DCFPyL and 83% (19 of 23; 95% CI: 59%, 100%), 52% (11 of 21; 95% CI: 29%, 74%), and 66% (19 of 29; 95% CI: 44%, 86%) for multiparametric MRI (P = .19, P = .02, and P = .17, respectively). The addition of 18F-DCFPyL to multiparametric MRI improved PPV by 38% overall (P = .02) and by 30% (P = .09) in the prostate bed.

LncRNA SNHG15 is verified to be an oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and prostate cancer. In this paper, we mainly investigate the potential influence of SNHG15 on the progression of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).  Patients and methods:   SNHG15 levels in NPC tissues and cell lines were detected by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). Correlation between SNHG15 level and prognosis of NPC patients was evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Regulatory effects of SNHG15 on proliferative, colony formation abilities, and apoptosis of SUNE1 and CNE1 cells were assessed through a series of functional experiments. Potential miRNAs binding SNHG15 and the downstream gene of the microRNA (miRNA) were predicted by bioinformatics method, which was confirmed by Dual-Luciferase reporter gene assay and Western blot.  Results:   SNHG15 was upregulated in NPC tissues and cells. High level of SNHG15 indicated worse survival in NPC patients. Knockdown of SNHG15 markedly suppressed proliferative ability and induced apoptosis in SUNE1 and CNE1 cells. It is verified that miR-141-3p was the direct target binding SNHG15, and KLF9 was the downstream gene of miR-141-3p. SNHG15 was demonstrated to be a ceRNA to upregulate KLF9 by competitively binding miR-141-3p.  Conclusions:   SNHG15 is upregulated in NPC tissues, and this aggravates the progression of NPC by absorbing miR-141-3p to upregulate KLF9.""","""['T-W Yi', 'X-X Lv', 'H Fan', 'N Zan', 'X-D Su']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci""","""['Long noncoding RNA SNHG15: A promising target in human cancers.', 'Knockdown of lncRNA XIST inhibits hypoxia-induced glycolysis, migration and invasion through regulating miR-381-3p/NEK5 axis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.', 'lncRNA SNHG8 promotes aggressive behaviors of nasopharyngeal carcinoma via regulating miR-656-3p/SATB1 axis.', 'Long Noncoding RNA FAM225A Promotes Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Tumorigenesis and Metastasis by Acting as ceRNA to Sponge miR-590-3p/miR-1275 and Upregulate ITGB3.', 'The Role of SNHG15 in the Pathogenesis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Long noncoding RNA SNHG15: A promising target in human cancers.', 'LncRNA SNHG1 promotes nasopharyngeal carcinoma development via targeting miR-424-5p.', 'lncRNA SNHG15 as a ceRNA modulates Osteoclast Differentiation, Proliferation, and Metastasis by Sponging miR-381-3p/NEK2 Axis.', 'Metastatic EMT Phenotype Is Governed by MicroRNA-200-Mediated Competing Endogenous RNA Networks.', 'The Role of lncRNAs in Rare Tumors with a Focus on HOX Transcript Antisense RNA (HOTAIR).']"""

Methods:   Between June 2009 and September 2015, 66 patients meeting the criteria for very high-risk disease received high-dose-rate brachytherapy (2 fractions of 9 Gy) as a boost of external beam radiotherapy (13 fractions of 3 Gy). Androgen deprivation therapy was administered for approximately 3 years. Biochemical failure was assessed using the Phoenix definition.  Results:   The median follow-up period was 53 months from the completion of radiotherapy. The 5-year biochemical failure-free, distant metastasis-free, prostate cancer-specific and overall survival rates were 88.7, 89.2, 98.5 and 97.0%, respectively.

Older age (>60 y), a higher clinical T stage (≥cT2), a higher PSA value at the time of biopsy (>10 ng/ml), and more time between the biopsy and the radical prostatectomy were significantly associated with a higher risk of upgrading. Positive margins and PSA relapse occurred more frequently in upgraded patients. Center size did not significantly affect the concordance rate (p = 0.40).This prospective, nationwide analysis demonstrated a Gleason score concordance rate of 62.9%. Upgrading was most frequently observed in the non-concordant group. We identified clinical and pathological factors associated with (non)-concordance. Upgrading was associated with a worse oncological outcome.

This study sought to understand men's experiences of living with and adjusting to advanced hormone-responsive PCa and how this influenced their quality of life (QoL), in order to highlight how support could be optimized.  Methods:   Participants were recruited through a UK wide survey-the 'Life After Prostate Cancer Diagnosis' study. In-depth telephone interviews were conducted with 24 men (aged 46-77 years) with advanced (stage IV) hormone-responsive PCa diagnosed 18-42 months previously. Thematic analysis was undertaken using a framework approach.  Results:   Most participants perceived their QoL to be relatively good, which was influenced by the following factors (enablers to 'living well' with PCa): a sense of connectedness to others, engagement in meaningful activities, resources (social, cognitive, financial), ability to manage uncertainty, utilization of adjustment strategies and support, communication and information from health professionals. Barriers to 'living well' with PCa were often the converse of these factors. These also included more troublesome PCa-related symptoms and stronger perceptions of loss and restriction.  Conclusions:   In our study, men living with advanced hormone-responsive PCa often reported a good QoL. Exploring the influences on QoL in men with advanced PCa indicates how future interventions might improve the QoL of men who are struggling. Further research is required to develop and test interventions that enhance QoL for these men.""","""['Lauren Matheson', 'Jo Nayoan', 'Carol Rivas', 'Jo Brett', 'Penny Wright', 'Hugh Butcher', 'Paul Jordan', 'Anna Gavin', 'Adam Glaser', 'Malcolm Mason', 'Richard Wagland', 'Eila Watson']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['Experiences of Australian men diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer: a qualitative study.', 'Impact of Prostate Cancer Treatment on the Sexual Quality of Life for Men-Who-Have-Sex-with-Men.', 'Perceptions of wellbeing and quality of life following participation in a community-based pre-operative exercise programme in men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer: A qualitative pilot study.', 'Quality of Life Among Black Prostate Cancer Survivors: An Integrative Review.', 'Psychosocial interventions for men with prostate cancer: a Cochrane systematic review.']"""

Here, we performed an unbiased drug screening on drivers-defined tumor organoids from mouse endometrial cancer, the most prevalent gynecological malignancy in human, with a small molecule library targeting epigenetic factors. Among them, menin-MLL inhibitors MI-136 and MI-463 scored. The therapeutic capacity of MI-136 was further validated in tumor organoids in vitro and an orthotopic model in vivo. CRISPR/cas9-mediated mutations of major components of the menin-MLL complex, Men1, Kmt2a and Ash2l, inhibited the growth of tumor organoids, suggesting that the complex was the target of MI-136. Transcriptome analysis showed that the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway was the most significantly downregulated pathway by MI-136 treatment. Consistently, Men1, Kmt2a, and Ash2l knockout also repressed the expressions of the HIF target genes. Loss of Hif1a or Hif1b partially phenocopied the inhibition of the menin-MLL complex by MI-136 or mutations in term of tumor organoid growth. Further, we found that MEN1 was upregulated in human endometrial cancers, which were tightly correlated with the expression levels of HIF1A, and associated with poor prognosis. Importantly, MI-136 also significantly inhibited the growth of endometrial cancer organoids derived from patients. Thus, our study identified MI-136 as a potential inhibitor for endometrial cancer through regulating the HIF pathway, a novel molecular mechanism distinguished from those in AML and prostate cancer.""","""['Jingyao Chen', 'Lei Zhao', 'Hongling Peng', 'Siqi Dai', 'Yuan Quan', 'Manli Wang', 'Jian Wang', 'Zhanying Bi', 'Ying Zheng', 'Shengtao Zhou', 'Yu Liu', 'Chong Chen', 'Feifei Na']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Gene Ther""","""['Synergistic targeting of FLT3 mutations in AML via combined menin-MLL and FLT3 inhibition.', 'Co-inhibition of HDAC and MLL-menin interaction targets MLL-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia cells via disruption of DNA damage checkpoint and DNA repair.', 'Menin regulates the serine biosynthetic pathway in Ewing sarcoma.', 'A Box of Chemistry to Inhibit the MEN1 Tumor Suppressor Gene Promoting Leukemia.', 'Challenges and opportunities in targeting the menin-MLL interaction.', 'Organoids.', 'Menin-MLL1 Interaction Small Molecule Inhibitors: A Potential Therapeutic Strategy for Leukemia and Cancers.', 'Combinatorial targeting of menin and the histone methyltransferase DOT1L as a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancer.', 'Development of bioinformatics and multi-omics analyses in organoids.', 'Precision oncology using ex vivo technology: a step towards individualised cancer care?']"""

Materials and methods:   We conducted a retrospective multicenter cohort study including 4,064 consecutive patients who had prostate cancer and underwent radical prostatectomy between January 1998 and June 2013. The primary endpoint of this study was all-cause mortality, and the secondary endpoints were cancer-specific mortality (CSM) and other-cause mortality (OCM). Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was calculated to assess the comorbidities of each patient.  Results:   Of 4,064 patients, 446 (11.0%) died during follow-up. The cause of death was prostate cancer in 132 patients (29.6%), other cancers in 121 patients (27.1%), and vascular disease in 57 patients (12.8%) in our cohort. The overall 10-year CSM rate was lower than the OCM rate (4.6% vs. 10.5%). The 10-year CSM rate was lower than the OCM rate in low- to intermediate-risk group patients (1.2% vs. 10.6%), whereas they were similar in high-risk group patients (11.8% vs. 10.1%). In the multivariable analysis, CCI was independently associated with all-cause mortality after radical prostatectomy, regardless of age and pathologic features.  Conclusion:   Death from prostate cancer was rare in Korean men who underwent radical prostatectomy. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of overtreatment of low-risk prostate cancer in men with significant comorbidity.

Design, setting, and participants:   Costs for surgical care for consecutive patients with localized prostate cancer treated from November 2018 to November 2019 were itemized and evaluated.  Intervention:   Patients were treated using either the SP (n = 78) or MP (n = 97) platform.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Demographics, perioperative data, and costs for surgical care of patients in both groups were analyzed.  Results and limitation:   The mean cost for prostatectomy was comparable between SP ($13 512 ± $1615) and MP ($13 284 ± $1360; p = 0.32). The main cost differences between the groups were the cost of hospitalization, which was lower in the SP group (p < 0.001), offset by the cost of disposables in the operating room, which was higher in the SP group (p < 0.001). The mean length of stay was significantly shorter in the SP group (9.84 ± 11.3 vs 35.5 ± 29.1 h; p < 0.001) and the proportion of patients discharged home on the day of surgery was higher in the SP group (70% vs 5%; p < 0.001). The main limitation of this study is its retrospective design.  Conclusions:   Overall, the costs for SP and MP prostatectomy are comparable. The higher SP cost for consumable surgical materials is offset by the lower cost associated with hospitalization, which was largely due to a shorter hospital stay after SP surgery.

Objective:   To interrogate the molecular and biological features of low-grade PCa serially over time.  Design, setting, and participants:   Nested longitudinal cohort study in an academic active surveillance (AS) program. Men were on AS for GG1 PCa from 2012 to 2017.  Intervention:   Electronic tracking and resampling of PCa using magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound fusion biopsy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   ERG immunohistochemistry (IHC) and targeted DNA/RNA next-generation sequencing were performed on initial and repeat biopsies. Tumor clonality was assessed. Molecular data were compared between men who upgraded and those who did not upgrade to GG ≥ 2 cancer.  Results and limitations:   Sixty-six men with median age 64 yr (interquartile range [IQR], 59-69) and prostate-specific antigen 4.9 ng/mL (IQR, 3.3-6.4) underwent repeat sampling of a tracked tumor focus (median interval, 11 mo; IQR, 6-13). IHC-based ERG fusion status was concordant at initial and repeat biopsies in 63 men (95% vs expected 50%, p < 0.001), and RNAseq-based fusion and isoform expression were concordant in nine of 13 (69%) ERG+ patients, supporting focal resampling. Among 15 men who upgraded with complete data at both time points, integrated DNA/RNAseq analysis provided evidence of shared clonality in at least five cases. Such cases could reflect initial undersampling, but also support the possibility of clonal temporal progression of low-grade cancer. Our assessment was limited by sample size and use of targeted sequencing.  Conclusions:   Repeat molecular assessment of low-grade tumors suggests that clonal progression could be one mechanism of upgrading. These data underscore the importance of serial tumor assessment in men pursuing AS of low-grade PCa.

The clinical behavior of localized PCa is highly variable. Some cancers are aggressive leading to death, while others can even be monitored safely. Hence, there is a high clinical need for precise biomarkers for identification of aggressive disease in addition to established clinical parameters.  Objective:   To develop an RNA expression-based score for the prediction of PCa prognosis that facilitates clinical decision making.  Design, setting, and participants:   We assessed 233 tissue specimens of PCa patients with long-term follow-up data from fresh-frozen radical prostatectomies (RPs), from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded RP specimens and biopsies by transcriptome-wide next-generation sequencing and customized expression microarrays.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We applied Cox proportional hazard models to the cohorts from different platforms and specimen types. Evidence from these models was combined by fixed-effect meta-analysis to identify genes predictive of the time to death of disease (DoD). Genes were combined by a weighted median approach into a prognostic score called ProstaTrend and transferred for the prediction of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after RP in an independent cohort of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).  Results and limitations:   ProstaTrend comprising ∼1400 genes was significantly associated with DoD in the training cohort of PCa patients treated by RP (leave-one-out cross-validation, Cox regression: p=2e-09) and with BCR in the TCGA validation cohort (Cox regression: p=3e-06). The prognostic impact persisted after multivariable Cox regression analysis adjusting for Gleason grading group (GG) ≥3 and resection status (p=0.001; DoD, training cohort) and for GG≥3, pathological stage ≥T3, and resection state (p=0.037; BCR, validation cohort).  Conclusions:   ProstaTrend is a transcriptome-based score that predicts DoD and BCR in cohorts of PCa patients treated with RP.

It remains unclear, however, whether mpMRI can safely replace confirmatory or surveillance biopsies in men with low-risk disease managed with active surveillance (AS). Overall, 166 men were upgraded at a median of 29 mo (interquartile range 13-54). The overall negative predictive value (NPV) of mpMRI was 79.5% and ranged from 74.4% to 84.6% for all AS biopsies up to the fourth surveillance biopsy.

Methods and materials:   A needle segmentation algorithm previously developed for HDR prostate brachytherapy was adapted and extended to 3D TVUS images from gynecologic ISBT patients with vaginal tumors. Two patients were used for refining/validating the modified algorithm and five patients (8-12 needles/patient) were reserved as an unseen test data set. The images were filtered to enhance needle edges, using intensity peaks to generate feature points, and leveraged the randomized 3D Hough transform to identify candidate needle trajectories. Algorithmic segmentations were compared against manual segmentations and calculated dwell positions were evaluated.  Results:   All 50 test data set needles were successfully segmented with 96% of algorithmically segmented needles having angular differences <3° compared with manually segmented needles and the maximum Euclidean distance was <2.1 mm. The median distance between corresponding dwell positions was 0.77 mm with 86% of needles having maximum differences <3 mm. The mean segmentation time using the algorithm was <30 s/patient.  Conclusions:   We successfully segmented multiple needles simultaneously in intraoperative 3D TVUS images from gynecologic HDR-ISBT patients with vaginal tumors and demonstrated the robustness of the algorithmic approach to image artifacts.

This approach is applied to study longitudinal blood plasma samples from prostate cancer patients, where longitudinal tissue biopsies from the bone and other metastatic sites have been challenging to collect.  Results:   A molecular characterization of archival plasma DNA from 233 patients and genomic profiling of 101 patients identifies clinical correlations of aneuploid plasma DNA profiles with poor survival, increased plasma DNA concentrations, and lower plasma DNA size distributions. Deep-exome sequencing and genomic copy number profiling are performed on 23 patients, including 9 patients with matched metastatic tissues and 12 patients with serial plasma samples. These data show a high concordance in genomic alterations between the plasma DNA and metastatic tissue samples, suggesting the plasma DNA is highly representative of the tissue alterations. Longitudinal sequencing of 12 patients with 2-5 serial plasma samples reveals clonal dynamics and genome evolution in response to hormonal and chemotherapy. By performing an integrated evolutionary analysis, minor subclones are identified in 9 patients that expanded in response to therapy and harbored mutations associated with resistance.  Conclusions:   This study provides an unbiased evolutionary approach to non-invasively delineate clonal dynamics and identify clones with mutations associated with resistance in prostate cancer.""","""['Naveen Ramesh', 'Emi Sei', 'Pei Ching Tsai', 'Shanshan Bai', 'Yuehui Zhao', 'Patricia Troncoso', 'Paul G Corn', 'Christopher Logothetis', 'Amado J Zurita', 'Nicholas E Navin']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Genome Biol""","""['Shallow whole-genome sequencing of plasma cell-free DNA accurately differentiates small from non-small cell lung carcinoma.', 'Implementation of a prostate cancer-specific targeted sequencing panel for credentialing of patient-derived cell lines and genomic characterization of patient samples.', 'Scalable whole-exome sequencing of cell-free DNA reveals high concordance with metastatic tumors.', 'Using circulating cell-free DNA to monitor personalized cancer therapy.', 'Clonal evolution of acute myeloid leukemia highlighted by latest genome sequencing studies.', 'Urinary DNA as a Tool for Germline and Somatic Mutation Detection in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'cfSNV: a software tool for the sensitive detection of somatic mutations from cell-free DNA.', 'The influencing factors of digital health passport adoption and acceptance during COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia.', 'Privacy and contact tracing efficacy.', 'cfTrack: A Method of Exome-Wide Mutation Analysis of Cell-free DNA to Simultaneously Monitor the Full Spectrum of Cancer Treatment Outcomes Including MRD, Recurrence, and Evolution.']"""

Many hospitals, however, collect and store Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) tumor samples. Consequently, the sample size of whole genome cancer cohort studies could be increased tremendously by including FFPE samples, although the presence of artefacts might obfuscate the variant calling. To assess whether FFPE material can be used for cohort studies, we performed an in-depth comparison of somatic SNVs called on matching FF and FFPE Whole Genome Sequence (WGS) samples extracted from the same tumor.  Methods:   Four variant callers (i.e. Strelka2, Mutect2, VarScan2 and Shimmer) were used to call somatic variants on matching FF and FFPE WGS samples from a metastatic prostate tumor. Using the variants identified by these callers, we developed a heuristic to maximize the overlap between the FF and its FFPE counterpart in terms of sensitivity and precision. The proposed variant calling approach was then validated on nine matched primary samples. Finally, we assessed what fraction of the discrepancy could be attributed to intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH), by comparing the overlap in clonal and subclonal somatic variants.  Results:   We first compared variants between an FF and an FFPE sample from a metastatic prostate tumor, showing that on average 50% of the calls in the FF are recovered in the FFPE sample, with notable differences between callers. Combining the variants of the different callers using a simple heuristic, increases both the precision and the sensitivity of the variant calling. Validating the heuristic on nine additional matched FF-FFPE samples, resulted in an average F1-score of 0.58 and an outperformance of any of the individual callers. In addition, we could show that part of the discrepancy between the FF and the FFPE samples can be attributed to ITH.  Conclusion:   This study illustrates that when using the correct variant calling strategy, the majority of clonal SNVs can be recovered in an FFPE sample with high precision and sensitivity. These results suggest that somatic variants derived from WGS of FFPE material can be used in cohort studies.""","""['Louise de Schaetzen van Brienen', 'Maarten Larmuseau', 'Kim Van der Eecken', 'Frederic De Ryck', 'Pauline Robbe', 'Anna Schuh', 'Jan Fostier', 'Piet Ost', 'Kathleen Marchal']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Med Genomics""","""['Whole exome sequencing (WES) on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).', 'Performance comparison of three DNA extraction kits on human whole-exome data from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded normal and tumor samples.', 'Targeted RNAseq assay incorporating unique molecular identifiers for improved quantification of gene expression signatures and transcribed mutation fraction in fixed tumor samples.', 'Accuracy of Molecular Data Generated with FFPE Biospecimens: Lessons from the Literature.', 'Unlocking the molecular archive: the emerging use of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue for biomarker research in urological cancer.', 'Simple combination of multiple somatic variant callers to increase accuracy.', 'Whole exome sequencing of FFPE samples-expanding the horizon of forensic molecular autopsies.', 'Combinatorial and Machine Learning Approaches for Improved Somatic Variant Calling From Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded Genome Sequence Data.', 'Cancer Neoantigens: Challenges and Future Directions for Prediction, Prioritization, and Validation.', 'Halvade somatic: Somatic variant calling with Apache Spark.']"""

In many well-known cases, breakpoints occur at two intragenic positions, leading to in-frame gene-gene fusions that generate chimeric mRNAs. However, fusions often occur with intergenic breakpoints, and the role of such fusions has not been carefully examined.  Results:   We analyze whole-genome sequencing data from 268 patients to catalog gene-intergenic and intergenic-intergenic fusions and characterize their impact. First, we discover that, in contrast to the common assumption, chimeric oncogenic transcripts-such as those involving ETV4, ERG, RSPO3, and PIK3CA-can be generated by gene-intergenic fusions through splicing of the intervening region. Second, we find that over-expression of an upstream or downstream gene by a fusion-mediated repositioning of a regulatory sequence is much more common than previously suspected, with enhancers sometimes located megabases away. We detect a number of recurrent fusions, such as those involving ANO3, RGS9, FUT5, CHI3L1, OR1D4, and LIPG in breast; IGF2 in colon; ETV1 in prostate; and IGF2BP3 and SIX2 in thyroid cancers.

Epidemiological studies on sarcoma from Australia are lacking, as previous studies have focused on a sarcoma type (e.g. soft tissue) or anatomical sites.  Methods:   Linked cancer registry, hospital morbidity and death registration data were available for Western Australia (WA) from 1982 to 2016. All new sarcoma cases among WA residents were included to estimate incidence, prevalence, relative survival and cancer-related hospitalisation, using the Information Network on Rare Cancers (RARECARENet) definitions. To provide a reference point, comparisons were made with female breast, colorectal, prostate and lung cancers.  Results:   For 2012-16, the combined sarcoma crude annual incidence was 7.3 per 100,000, with the majority of these soft tissue sarcoma (STS, incidence of 5.9 per 100,000). The age-standardised incidence and prevalence of STS increased over time, while bone sarcoma remained more stable. Five-year relative survival for the period 2012-16 for STS was 65% for STS (higher than lung cancer, but lower than prostate, female breast and colorectal cancers), while five-year relative survival was 71% for bone sarcoma. Cancer-related hospitalisations cost an estimated $(Australian) 29.1 million over the study period.  Conclusions:   STS incidence has increased over time in WA, with an increasing proportion of people diagnosed aged ≥65 years. The analysis of health service use showed sarcoma had a lower mean episode of cancer-related hospitalisation compared to the reference cancers in 2016, but the mean cost per prevalent person was higher for sarcoma than for female breast, colorectal and prostate cancers.""","""['Cameron M Wright', 'Georgia Halkett', 'Richard Carey Smith', 'Rachael Moorin']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Annual Report to the Nation on the status of cancer, 1975-2010, featuring prevalence of comorbidity and impact on survival among persons with lung, colorectal, breast, or prostate cancer.', 'Incidence, mortality, and survival trends of soft tissue and bone sarcoma in Switzerland between 1996 and 2015.', 'Soft tissue sarcoma in Italy: From epidemiological data to clinical networking to improve patient care and outcomes.', 'Increasing incidence rates of soft tissue sarcomas?

Here, we have evaluated matrine for its activity on C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-9/2) expression, and its potential to affect tumor metastasis and invasion. The effects of matrine on CXCR4, MMP-9/2, and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation in lung (A549), prostate (DU145), and pancreas (MIA PaCa-2) cells were investigated by diverse techniques. The expression level of CXCR4 and MMP-9/2 was analyzed by western blot analysis and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. NF-κB activation was also evaluated by western blot analysis, electrophoretic mobility shift assay as well as immunocytochemical experiments. Furthermore, we monitored cell invasion and metastasis activities by wound healing and Boyden chamber assays. We noted that matrine induced a down-regulation of CXCR4 and MMP-9/2 at both protein and mRNA levels. In addition, matrine negatively regulated human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 12 (CXCL12)-induced CXCR4 expression. Moreover, NF-κB suppression by matrine led to inhibition of metastatic potential of tumor cells.

The (+)-brevipolide H, an α-pyrone-based natural compound, induced potent and long-term anticancer effects in human castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) PC-3 cells. Flow cytofluorometric analysis with propidium iodide staining showed (+)-brevipolide H-induced G1 arrest of cell cycle and subsequent apoptosis through induction of caspase cascades. Since Akt/mTOR pathway has been well substantiated in participating in cell cycle progression in G1 phase, its signaling and downstream regulators were examined. Consequently, (+)-brevipolide H inhibited the signaling pathway of Akt/mTOR/p70S6K. The c-Myc inhibition and downregulation of G1 phase cyclins were also attributed to (+)-brevipolide H action. Overexpression of myristoylated Akt significantly rescued mTOR/p70S6K and downstream signaling under (+)-brevipolide H treatment. ROS and Ca2+, two key mediators in regulating intracellular signaling, were determined, showing that (+)-brevipolide H interactively induced ROS production and an increase of intracellular Ca2+ levels. The (+)-Brevipolide H also induced the downregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, indicating the contribution of mitochondrial dysfunction to apoptosis. In conclusion, the data suggest that (+)-brevipolide H displays anticancer activity through crosstalk between ROS production and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. In addition, suppression of Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway associated with downregulation of G1 phase cyclins contributes to (+)-brevipolide H-mediated anticancer activity, which ultimately causes mitochondrial dysfunction and cell apoptosis. The data also support the biological significance and, possibly, clinically important development of natural product-based anticancer approaches.""","""['Yi-Hua Sheng', 'Wohn-Jenn Leu', 'Ching-Nung Chen', 'Jui-Ling Hsu', 'Ying-Tung Liu', 'Lih-Ching Hsu', 'Duen-Ren Hou', 'Jih-Hwa Guh']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Molecules""","""['Luteoloside induces G0/G1 arrest and pro-death autophagy through the ROS-mediated AKT/mTOR/p70S6K signalling pathway in human non-small cell lung cancer cell lines.', 'Non-immunosuppressive triazole-based small molecule induces anticancer activity against human hormone-refractory prostate cancers: the role in inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and c-Myc signaling pathways.', 'Ascleposide, a natural cardenolide, induces anticancer signaling in human castration-resistant prostatic cancer through Na+ /K+ -ATPase internalization and tubulin acetylation.', 'Targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Targeting PI3K/Akt/mTOR Pathway by Different Flavonoids: A Cancer Chemopreventive Approach.', 'Strategies for the synthesis of brevipolides.']"""

In the context of cancer treatment, cancer cell therapy-induced senescence (TIS) is emerging as an omnipresent cell fate decision that can be pharmacologically targeted at the molecular level to enhance the beneficial aspects of senescence. In prostate cancer (PCa), TIS has been reported using multiple different model systems, and a more systematic analysis would be useful to identify relevant senescence manipulation molecular targets. Here we show that a spectrum of PCa senescence phenotypes can be induced by clinically relevant therapies. We found that DNA damage inducers like irradiation and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase1 (PARP) inhibitors triggered a stable PCa-TIS independent of the p53 status. On the other hand, enzalutamide triggered a reversible senescence-like state that lacked evidence of cell death or DNA damage. Using a small senolytic drug panel, we found that senescence inducers dictated senolytic sensitivity. While Bcl-2 family anti-apoptotic inhibitor were lethal for PCa-TIS cells harboring evidence of DNA damage, they were ineffective against enzalutamide-TIS cells. Interestingly, piperlongumine, which was described as a senolytic, acted as a senomorphic to enhance enzalutamide-TIS proliferation arrest without promoting cell death. Overall, our results suggest that TIS phenotypic hallmarks need to be evaluated in a context-dependent manner because they can vary with senescence inducers, even within identical cancer cell populations. Defining this context-dependent spectrum of senescence phenotypes is key to determining subsequent molecular strategies that target senescent cancer cells.""","""['Nicolas Malaquin', 'Arthur Vancayseele', 'Sophie Gilbert', 'Laureen Antenor-Habazac', 'Marc-Alexandre Olivier', 'Zakia Ait Ali Brahem', 'Fred Saad', 'Guila Delouya', 'Francis Rodier']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cells""","""['Androgen receptor inhibitor-induced ""BRCAness"" and PARP inhibition are synthetically lethal for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Enhanced radiosensitization of enzalutamide via schedule dependent administration to androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells.', 'Exploiting interconnected synthetic lethal interactions between PARP inhibition and cancer cell reversible senescence.', 'Tumor Cell Recovery from Senescence Induced by Radiation with PARP Inhibition.', 'The interplay between apoptosis and cellular senescence: Bcl-2 family proteins as targets for cancer therapy.', ""Targeting Prostate Cancer, the 'Tousled Way'."", 'STL127705 synergize with olaparib in castration-resistant prostate cancer by inhibiting homologous recombination and non-homologous end-joining repair.', 'Involvement of Bcl-2 Family Proteins in Tetraploidization-Related Senescence.', 'Distinct mechanisms mediating therapy-induced cellular senescence in prostate cancer.', 'Molecular Mechanisms to Target Cellular Senescence in Aging and Disease.']"""

Growth factor independence-1 (Gfi1) is a transcriptional repressor with an important role in human malignancies, including leukemia, colorectal carcinoma, and lung cancer, but its role in prostate and breast cancer is unknown. We have found that Gfi1 epigenetic silencing is a common event in prostate and breast cancer. Gfi1 re-expression in prostate and breast cancer cell lines displaying Gfi1 epigenetic silencing decreases cell proliferation, reduced colony formation density, and tumor growth in nude mice xenografts. In addition, we found that Gfi1 repress alpha 1-anti-trypsin (AAT) and alpha 1-anti-chymotrypsin (ACT) expression, two genes with important functions in cancer development, suggesting that Gfi1 silencing promotes tumor growth by increasing AAT and ACT expression in our system. Finally, Gfi1 epigenetic silencing could be a promising biomarker for prostate cancer progression because it is associated with shorter disease-free survival.

We found that nontoxicological levels of WESGR did not attenuate PC3 and LNCaP cell adhesion to serum but did significantly do so with collagen. In addition, using the Boyden chamber assay, we found that nontoxicological levels of WESGR did not inhibit the migration of PC3 and LNCaP cells to a serum-coated area but did significantly attenuate migration to a collagen-coated area. Interestingly, the expression of α2β1 integrin, a known receptor of collagen, was not affected by ectopic administration of WESGR. However, WESGR significantly attenuated the expression of β1 integrin, but not α2 integrin when PC3 and LNCaP cells were placed on a collagen-coated plate, resulting in attenuation of focal adherent kinase phosphorylation. Finally, 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid was determined as a functional single component which is responsible for antiprostate cancer effects of WESGR.

This α-emitting radionuclide has a beneficial effect on pain and is also capable to increase overall survival (OS). Several studies evaluated the prognostic value of different biomarkers at baseline, such as serum values, imaging parameters or pain. To date, however, clinicians lack a validated and simple system to assess which patients will most likely benefit from 223Ra treatment. The 3-variable prognostic score (3-PS), proposed in a single-center study in 2017 classifies patients in five prognostic groups with a specific OS. This study aims to validate the 3-PS in a larger multicenter population.  Methods:   Four hundred and thirty mCRPC patients treated with 223Ra from six different centers were analyzed. The 3-PS score consists of the collection of baseline hemoglobin, prostatic specific antigen and Eastern cooperative oncology group performance status and was initially applied to the whole population (total group). The score was then validated on the 338 patient's subgroup (clean group) obtained by subtracting the 92 patients enrolled for the original study of the 3-PS score. This purified group served as further validation evidence.  Results:   Statistical analysis showed that the 3-PS score was valid on the total group as well as in the clean group as the AUC estimated (0.74) falls within the CI of the AUC calculated on the validation sample (95% CI 0.66-0.82).  Conclusion:   This study confirms the validity of the 3-PS score for mCRPC patients. This score is simple, noninvasive and affordable and can be easily used to select patients that will most probably complete 223Ra treatment.

However, annotated datasets are often limited because it is prone to variations in acquisition parameters and require high-level expert's knowledge, and manually labeling targets by tracing their contour is often laborious. Developing fast, interactive, and weakly supervised deep learning methods is thus highly desirable.  Methods:   We propose a new efficient deep learning method to accurately segment targets from images while generating an annotated dataset for deep learning methods. It involves a generative neural network-based prior-knowledge prediction from pseudo-contour landmarks. The predicted prior knowledge (i.e., contour proposal) is then refined using a convolutional neural network that leverages the information from the predicted prior knowledge and the raw input image. Our method was evaluated on a clinical database of 145 intraoperative ultrasound and 78 postoperative CT images of image-guided prostate brachytherapy. It was also evaluated on a cardiac multi-structure segmentation from 450 2D echocardiographic images.  Results:   Experimental results show that our model can segment the prostate clinical target volume in 0.499 s (i.e., 7.79 milliseconds per image) with an average Dice coefficient of 96.9 ± 0.9% and 95.4 ± 0.9%, 3D Hausdorff distance of 4.25 ± 4.58 and 5.17 ± 1.41 mm, and volumetric overlap ratio of 93.9 ± 1.80% and 91.3 ± 1.70 from TRUS and CT images, respectively. It also yielded an average Dice coefficient of 96.3 ± 1.3% on echocardiographic images.  Conclusions:   We proposed and evaluated a fast, interactive deep learning method for accurate medical image segmentation.

Methods:   This descriptive, retrospective study reviewed all cancer cases recorded in the Bugando Cancer Registry (BCR), a clinical and pathology based registry at the only cancer referral hospital in the region. Primary tumor site, method of diagnosis, HIV status, and cancer treatment were reported. Using census data, the 2012 GLOBOCAN estimates for Tanzania were scaled to the Lake Zone and adjusted for 2016 population growth. These estimates were then compared to BCR cases using one-sample tests of proportion.  Results:   A total of 2772 cases were reported from 2008-2016. Among these, the majority of cases (82.5 %, n = 2286) were diagnosed among adults. Most cases (85 %, n = 1923) were diagnosed by histology or cytology. Among adults, the most common cancers diagnosed were cervix (22.7 %, n=520), breast (12.6 %, n=288), and prostate (8.5 %, n=195). Among children, the most common cancers were non-Burkitt non-Hodgkin lymphoma (17.3 %, n=84), Burkitt lymphoma (16.5 %, n=80), and Wilms tumor (14.6 %, n=71). The 1116 BCR cases represent 12.2 % of the 9165 expected number of cancer cases for the Lake Zone (p < 0.001). 1494 cases (53.9 %) received some form of treatment - surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or hormone therapy - while 1278 cases (46.1 %) had no treatment recorded.  Conclusions:   This comprehensive report of the BCR reveals cancer epidemiology and treatment utilization patterns typical of hospitals in low-resource settings.

The Gleason scoring system is the primary diagnostic and prognostic tool for prostate cancer. Furthermore, recent reports indicate that the presence of patterns of the Gleason scale such as the cribriform pattern may also correlate with a worse prognosis compared to other patterns belonging to the Gleason grade 4. Current clinical guidelines have indicated the convenience of highlight its presence during the analysis of biopsies. All these requirements suppose a great workload for the pathologist during the analysis of each sample, which is based on the pathologist's visual analysis of the morphology and organisation of the glands in the tissue, a time-consuming and subjective task. In recent years, with the development of digitisation devices, the use of computer vision techniques for the analysis of biopsies has increased. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the development of algorithms to automatically detect individual cribriform patterns belonging to Gleason grade 4 has not yet been studied in the literature. The objective of the work presented in this paper is to develop a deep-learning-based system able to support pathologists in the daily analysis of prostate biopsies. This analysis must include the Gleason grading of local structures, the detection of cribriform patterns, and the Gleason scoring of the whole biopsy.  Methods:   The methodological core of this work is a patch-wise predictive model based on convolutional neural networks able to determine the presence of cancerous patterns based on the Gleason grading system. In particular, we train from scratch a simple self-design architecture with three filters and a top model with global-max pooling. The cribriform pattern is detected by retraining the set of filters of the last convolutional layer in the network. Subsequently, a biopsy-level prediction map is reconstructed by bi-linear interpolation of the patch-level prediction of the Gleason grades. In addition, from the reconstructed prediction map, we compute the percentage of each Gleason grade in the tissue to feed a multi-layer perceptron which provides a biopsy-level score.  Results:   In our SICAPv2 database, composed of 182 annotated whole slide images, we obtained a Cohen's quadratic kappa of 0.77 in the test set for the patch-level Gleason grading with the proposed architecture trained from scratch. Our results outperform previous ones reported in the literature. Furthermore, this model reaches the level of fine-tuned state-of-the-art architectures in a patient-based four groups cross validation. In the cribriform pattern detection task, we obtained an area under ROC curve of 0.82. Regarding the biopsy Gleason scoring, we achieved a quadratic Cohen's Kappa of 0.81 in the test subset. Shallow CNN architectures trained from scratch outperform current state-of-the-art methods for Gleason grades classification. Our proposed model is capable of characterising the different Gleason grades in prostate tissue by extracting low-level features through three basic blocks (i.e. convolutional layer + max pooling). The use of global-max pooling to reduce each activation map has shown to be a key factor for reducing complexity in the model and avoiding overfitting. Regarding the Gleason scoring of biopsies, a multi-layer perceptron has shown to better model the decision-making of pathologists than previous simpler models used in the literature.""","""['Julio Silva-Rodríguez', 'Adrián Colomer', 'María A Sales', 'Rafael Molina', 'Valery Naranjo']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Comput Methods Programs Biomed""","""['WeGleNet: A weakly-supervised convolutional neural network for the semantic segmentation of Gleason grades in prostate histology images.', 'Self-Learning for Weakly Supervised Gleason Grading of Local Patterns.', 'Automated deep-learning system for Gleason grading of prostate cancer using biopsies: a diagnostic study.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.', 'Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'Data-driven color augmentation for H&E stained images in computational pathology.', 'Artificial intelligence for prostate cancer histopathology diagnostics.', 'Artificial intelligence as a tool for diagnosis in digital pathology whole slide images: A systematic review.', 'Deep Neural Network-Aided Histopathological Analysis of Myocardial Injury.', 'Convolutional Neural Network-Based Clinical Predictors of Oral Dysplasia: Class Activation Map Analysis of Deep Learning Results.']"""

Evidence on second-line therapy upon progression on chemohormonal treatment outside clinical trials is scarce.  Objective:   To comparatively assess the efficacy of subsequent therapy after upfront docetaxel in mHSPC in a real-world setting.  Design, setting, and participants:   This is a retrospective multicenter analysis. Males with mHSPC on androgen-deprivation therapy progressed to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) after upfront docetaxel.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival 2 (PFS2), and time to progression 2 (TTP2) were assessed. Chi-square test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for univariate comparison between the sHT and non-sHT (other therapies) cohorts. Median time to event was tested by Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate analysis regression was performed with the Cox proportional-hazard model.  Results and limitations:   Sixty-five patients were included in the final analysis. Median TTP2 was 20 mo, median PFS2 was 29 mo, and median OS was not reached; sHT was an independent predictor of favorable PFS2 as compared with non-sHT. Time to CRPC was also confirmed to be the strongest predictor for novel endpoints PFS2 and TTP2. Time to CRPC >18 mo conferred advantage to sHT over non-sHT in relation to PFS2 and OS. Second-line therapies were well tolerated. The analysis is prone to inherent flaws and biases due to its retrospective nature.  Conclusions:   In real-world patients progressing after upfront docetaxel, sHT is independently associated with favorable PFS2 favoring drug class switch. Longer time to CRPC predicts strongly for superior PFS2 and TTP2. Further prospective research is warranted in order to guide treatment sequencing and improve outcomes and quality of life of males with metastasized prostate cancer.

Based on the analysis of quality control samples at the lower limit of quantification, low, medium and high concentrations, the method was precise (CVabiraterone ≤ 9.72%; CVD4A ≤ 14.64%) and accurate (CVabiraterone 95.51-107.59%; CVD4A 98.04-99.89%). Application of the method to the quantification of abiraterone and D4A in 10 clinical samples revealed important variability in the conversion ratio of abiraterone to D4A (CV 90.85%). Considering the current literature, this is the fastest method to quantify abiraterone and D4A in plasma, allowing for optimization of the analytical routine.""","""['Thaís Luise Dillenburg Weiss', 'Carolina Mesquita Furtado', 'Marina Venzon Antunes', 'Gustavo Gössling', 'Gilberto Schwartsmann', 'Rafael Linden', 'Simone Gasparin Verza']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Biomed Chromatogr""","""['An LC-MS/MS method for quantification of abiraterone, its active metabolites D(4)-abiraterone (D4A) and 5α-abiraterone, and their inactive glucuronide derivatives.', 'An LC-MS/MS method for quantification of the active abiraterone metabolite Δ(4)-abiraterone (D4A) in human plasma.', 'Bioanalytical evaluation of dried plasma spots for monitoring of abiraterone and ∆(4)-abiraterone from cancer patients.', 'Evaluation of dried blood spots as an alternative matrix for therapeutic drug monitoring of abiraterone and delta(4)-abiraterone in prostate cancer patients.', 'Quantitation of the anticancer drug abiraterone and its metabolite Δ(4)-abiraterone in human plasma using high-resolution mass spectrometry.']"""

We also investigated the impact of well-known risk factors for BCR.  Methods:   Between 2002 and 2014, 627 consecutive patients underwent LRPs at our institution. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentrations above 0.2 ng/mL were defined as BCR. Conditional BCR-free survival rates were determined through Kaplan-Meier analysis. Assessment of potential BCR risk factors was performed using a Cox proportional hazard analysis.  Results:   The 10-year BCR-free rates after LRP increased to 82.4%, 84.5%, 86.6%, 90.1%, and 94.7% in patients surviving 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7.5 years without BCR, respectively. Multivariate analyses of age, PSA concentrations, neoadjuvant therapy, and pathological findings were performed for all patients. In all patients, positive surgical margins (PSM) and Gleason Grade Groups (GG) ≥ 4 were independent risk factors for BCR (p < 0.001, hazard ratio [HR] = 2.45; and p < 0.001, HR = 2.83, respectively,). Similarly, PSM and GG ≥ 4 were significant risk factors in patients surviving 1-5 years without BCR. No clear risk factors were observed in patients surviving > 5 years without BCR after LRPs.  Conclusions:   The BCR-free rate increased with time after LRP. It is recommended that patients with PSM, GG ≥ 4, or with both factors are strictly monitored for 5 years postoperatively.

Methods:   We conducted a cross-sectional survey in one Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) and one Ministry of Health (MoH) oncology hospital in Mexico City. Formal labor market workers and their families have access to social health insurance that IMSS provides, while unemployed and informal workers receive care at the MoH. The study population comprised breast, colorectal, prostate, and hematologic cancer patients, aged ≥ 18 years, who attended outpatient consultations. Patients responded a short-form SC-needs questionnaire and a quality of PCC questionnaire. We used multiple logistic regression models to determine the independent association between educational attainment and high SC-needs and quality of PCC after controlling for sociodemographic and clinical covariates.  Results:   We included 1058 IMSS and 606 MoH cancer patients. MoH patients perceived higher SC-needs and lower quality of PCC than IMSS patients. MoH patients with low education had a greater probability of high psychological and health system SC needs and lower likelihood of being informed for treatment decision-making and care for their biopsychosocial needs. IMSS patients with low educational levels had lower probability of receiving timely care and clarity of information than those with high education. Receiving high-quality PCC was associated with decreased SC needs.

To date there are only limited data regarding the prognostic role of pain in men with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC). The objective of our analysis was to assess if the presence of pain can be considered an independent prognostic factor in mCSPC patients.  Methods:   A retrospective analysis was performed on patients with mCSPC referring to six oncology centers in Italy. Clinical and pathological features were recorded. Patients were considered to have pain if this was reported within the patient's file or in case of a chronic analgesic therapy was found among the concomitant medications. Survivals were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and compared across groups using the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazard models, stratified according to the baseline characteristics, were used to estimate hazard ratios for overall survival (OS). All the variables were significant if p < 0.05.  Results:   Data about pain were available for 365 cases and pain was present in 34.8% of patients. Pain was mainly associated with high value of prostate-specific antigen, metastatic bone extension regardless of the site, and lymph node involvement. mCSPC patients with pain had in most of the cases high-volume or Hr disease, and significant shorter OS (27.0 vs. 58.2 months, p < 0.001) and PFS (10.1 vs. 17.4 months, p < 0.001) compared to those without pain. The negative impact of pain on OS remained significant even if adjusted for CHAARTED or LATITUDE classification, and other significant baseline prognostic factors.

However, the expression and role of most DEGs involved in bioinformatics analysis are invalidated. This study aimed to disclose the mechanism of insulin resistance via bioinformatics analysis based on validated insulin resistance-related genes (IRRGs) collected from public disease-gene databases. MATERIAL AND METHODS IRRGs were collected from 4 disease databases including NCBI-Gene, CTD, RGD, and Phenopedia. GO and KEGG analysis of IRRGs were performed by DAVID. Then, the STRING database was employed to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of IRRGs. The module analysis and hub genes identification were carried out by MCODE and cytoHubba plugin of Cytoscape based on the primary PPI network, respectively. RESULTS A total of 1195 IRRGs were identified. Response to drug, hypoxia, insulin, positive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, cell proliferation, inflammatory response, negative regulation of apoptotic process, glucose homeostasis, cellular response to insulin stimulus, and aging were proposed as the crucial functions related to insulin resistance. Ten insulin resistance-related pathways included the pathways of insulin resistance, pathways in cancer, adipocytokine, prostate cancer, PI3K-Akt, insulin, AMPK, HIF-1, prolactin, and pancreatic cancer signaling pathway were revealed. INS, AKT1, IL-6, TP53, TNF, VEGFA, MAPK3, EGFR, EGF, and SRC were identified as the top 10 hub genes.

Experimental design:   To identify genomic alterations associated with race, we compared the frequencies of somatic alterations in PCa obtained from four publicly available datasets comprising 250 AFR and 611 European American (EUR) men and a targeted sequencing dataset from a commercial platform of 436 AFR and 3018 EUR men.  Results:   Mutations in ZFHX3 as well as focal deletions in ETV3 were more frequent in tumors from AFR men. TP53 mutations were associated with increasing Gleason score. MYC amplifications were more frequent in tumors from AFR men with metastatic PCa, whereas deletions in PTEN and rearrangements in TMPRSS2-ERG were less frequent in tumors from AFR men. KMT2D truncations and CCND1 amplifications were more frequent in primary PCa from AFR men. Genomic features that could impact clinical decision making were not significantly different between the two groups including tumor mutation burden, MSI status, and genomic alterations in select DNA repair genes, CDK12, and in AR.

Methods:   Two MR images (MR1 and MR2) were acquired with 30 min apart for each of the 35 patients enrolled in this study. The clinical target volume (CTV) and organs at risk (OARs) were delineated based on MR1. Using a synthetic CT (sCT), ultra-hypofractionated VMAT treatment plans were created for MR1, with three different planning target volume (PTV) margins of 7 mm, 5 mm and 3 mm. The three treatment plans of MR1, were recalculated onto MR2 using its corresponding sCT. The dose distribution of MR2 represented delivered dose to the patient after 30 min of adaptive replanning, omitting motion correction before beam on. MR2 was registered to MR1, using deformable registration. Using the inverse deformation, the structures of MR1 was deformed to fit MR2 and anatomical changes were quantified. For dose distribution comparison the dose distribution of MR2 was warped to the geometry MR1.  Results:   The mean center of mass vector offset for the CTV was 1.92 mm [0.13 - 9.79 mm]. Bladder volume increase ranged from 12.4 to 133.0% and rectum volume difference varied between -10.9 and 38.8%. Using the conventional 7 mm planning target volume (PTV) margin the dose reduction to the CTV was 1.1%. Corresponding values for 5 mm and 3 mm PTV margin were 2.0% and 4.2% respectively. The dose to the PTV and OARs also decreased from D1 to D2, for all PTV margins evaluated. Statistically significant difference was found for CTV Dmin between D1 and D2 for the 3 mm PTV margin (p < 0.01).  Conclusions:   A target underdosage caused by anatomical changes occurring during the reported time frame for adaptive replanning MR-linac workflows was found. Volume changes in both bladder and rectum caused large prostate displacements.

Screening and management of PCa remain controversial and, therefore, the discovery of novel molecular biomarkers is urgently needed. Alteration in cancer cell metabolism is a recognized hallmark of cancer, whereby cancer cells exhibit high glycolytic rates with subsequent lactate production, regardless of oxygen availability. To maintain the hyperglycolytic phenotype, cancer cells efficiently export lactate through the monocarboxylate transporters MCT1 and MCT4. The impact of inhibiting lactate production/extrusion on PCa cell survival and aggressiveness was investigated in vitro and ex vivo using primary tumor and metastatic PCa cell lines and the chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model. In this study, we showed the metastatic PCa cell line (DU125) displayed higher expression levels of MCT1/4 isoforms and glycolysis-related markers than the localized prostate tumor-derived cell line (22RV1), indicating these proteins are differentially expressed throughout prostate malignant transformation. Moreover, disruption of lactate export by MCT1/4 silencing resulted in a decrease in PCa cell growth and motility. To support these results, we pharmacological inhibited lactate production (via inhibition of LDH) and release (via inhibition of MCTs) and a reduction in cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo was observed. In summary, our data provide evidence that MCT1 and MCT4 are important players in prostate neoplastic progression and that inhibition of lactate production/export can be explored as a strategy for PCa treatment.""","""['Andreia Pereira-Nunes', 'Susana Simões-Sousa', 'Céline Pinheiro', 'Vera Miranda-Gonçalves', 'Sara Granja', 'Fátima Baltazar']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Basis Dis""","""['Tumor-stroma metabolic relationship based on lactate shuttle can sustain prostate cancer progression.', 'Androgens enhance the glycolytic metabolism and lactate export in prostate cancer cells by modulating the expression of GLUT1, GLUT3, PFK, LDH and MCT4 genes.', 'CD147 subunit of lactate/H+ symporters MCT1 and hypoxia-inducible MCT4 is critical for energetics and growth of glycolytic tumors.', 'The expression of lactate transporters (MCT1 and MCT4) in heart and muscle.', 'Monocarboxylate transporters in cancer.', 'Lactate as Key Metabolite in Prostate Cancer Progression: What Are the Clinical Implications?', 'The Oligostilbene Gnetin H Is a Novel Glycolysis Inhibitor That Regulates Thioredoxin Interacting Protein Expression and Synergizes with OXPHOS Inhibitor in Cancer Cells.', 'Glucose-Functionalized Silver Nanoparticles as a Potential New Therapy Agent Targeting Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer cells.', 'The Roles of Tumor-Associated Macrophages in Prostate Cancer.', 'Personalized Medicine for Prostate Cancer: Is Targeting Metabolism a Reality?']"""

Method:   Thirty-six consecutive patients (70 ± 8 years) with multi-parametric prostate MRI (mp-MRI; 3 T) and subsequently verified prostate cancer (PCa) by targeted plus systematic MR/US-fusion biopsy from 03/2016 to 12/2017 were included. Readout-segmented (rs) multi shot echo-planar imaging (EPI), parallel transmit (ptx) EPI, and single-shot (ss) EPI with b-values of 0, (500,) 1,000 s/mm² and calculated b1,500 were prospectively acquired of every patient. Signal intensities (SI) of PCa and benign tissue (peripheral and transition zone; PZ and TZ) in ADC, b1,000, and calculated b1,500 images were analyzed. Endpoints were signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and subjective IQ on a 5-point scale by two blinded readers.  Results:   For ss-EPI ADC, b-values of 1,000, and calculated 1,500 s/mm² images showed a higher SNR compared to rs-EPI and ptx-EPI (p < 0.01). CNR of PCa and benign tissue was significantly higher for rs-EPI in high b value images compared to ptx-EPI and ss-EPI (p < 0.01). Subjective IQ was significantly higher for rs-EPI (p < 0.01). Significantly higher ADC reduction combined with signal increase on high b value images for PCa compared to the surrounding healthy tissue in PZ and TZ (PCa contrast intensity) was detected for rs-EPI (p < 0.01). Single PCa lesions could only be recognized and correlated on rs-EPI.  Conclusions:   Rs-EPI and ptx-EPI were superior to ss-EPI regarding contrast intensity of PCA, but inferior regarding SNR. Subjective imaging parameters were superior for rs-EPI.

The aptasensor was set up using a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) modified by gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) conjugated to thiolated aptamers.  Methods:   Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were implemented for electrochemical (EC) characterization of the aptasensor. The determination of PSA was also performed through differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in [Fe (CN) 6]3-/4- electrolyte solution.  Results:   The present aptasensor was shown an outstanding linear response in the concentration range of 1 pg/mL - 200 ng/mL with a remarkably lower limit of detection of 0.077 pg/mL. The optimum concentration for PSA separation and the optimum incubation time for antigen-aptamer binding were determined by observing and electing the highest electrochemical responses in a specified time or concentration.  Conclusion:   According to the results of the specificity tests, the designed aptasensor did not show any significant interactions with other analytes in real samples. Clinical functionality of the aptasensor was appraised in serum samples of healthy individuals and patients examining the PSA level through the fabricated aptasensor and the reference methods.

Objectives:   The aim of this study was to understand the factors that affect positive thinking among patients with prostate cancer and the mediating role of self-efficacy.  Methods:   A cross-sectional design and a convenience sampling method were used to recruit patients with prostate cancer from 2 hospitals in Taiwan. Structured scales were used for data collection, including the General Self-efficacy Scale, Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite, Positive Thinking Scale, and Social Support Scale.  Results:   The total average score for positive thinking among 201 patients was 66.1 (SD, 9.4). The factors that influenced the positive thinking of patients with prostate cancer included self-efficacy, treatment satisfaction, perceived health status, marital status, and appraisal support. The effects of treatment satisfaction and appraisal support on positive thinking were partly achieved through self-efficacy (partial mediation).  Conclusions:   Self-efficacy is a mediator that affects the relationship of treatment satisfaction, appraisal support, and positive thinking.

However usual-type adenocarcinomas may also contain areas of NE differentiation, and in this context the molecular features and biological significance are less certain.  Methods:   We examined the molecular phenotype and oncologic outcomes of primary prostate adenocarcinomas with ≥5% NE differentiation (≥5% chromogranin A-positive NE cells in any given tumor spot on tissue microarray) using three independent study sets: a set of tumors with paneth cell-like NE differentiation (n = 26), a retrospective case-cohort of intermediate- and high-risk patients enriched for adverse outcomes (n = 267), and primary tumors from a retrospective series of men with eventual castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer (CRPC) treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide (n = 55).  Results:   Benign NE cells expressed significantly lower quantified AR levels compared with paired benign luminal cells (P < .001). Similarly, paneth-like NE carcinoma cells or carcinoma cells expressing chromogranin A expressed significantly lower quantified AR levels than paired non-NE carcinoma cells (P < .001). Quantified ERG protein expression, was also lower in chromogranin A-labeled adenocarcinoma cells compared with unlabeled cells (P < .001) and tumors with NE differentiation showed lower gene expression scores for AR activity compared with those without. Despite evidence of lower AR signaling, adenocarcinomas with NE differentiation did not differ by prevalence of TP53 missense mutations, or PTEN or RB1 loss, compared with those without NE differentiation. Finally, NE differentiation was not associated with time to metastasis in intermediate- and high-risk patients (P = .6 on multivariate analysis), nor with progression-free survival in patients with CRPC treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide (P = .9).

The problems like target non-specificity and toxicity are well-known regarding anticancer drugs. Therefore, target specific search of novel entities is constant. Isothymusin is a dimethoxy, trihydroxy flavone present in plants like Ocimum sanctum, and Limnophilla geoffrayi. There are limited reports available on the anticancer potential of isothymusin.  Objectives:   The effects of isothymusin on redox status, cell cytotoxicity, and targets involved in the promotion and progression of the cancer cells have been investigated.  Methods:   Antiproliferative efficacy was evaluated by MTT, Neutral Red Uptake, and Sulforhodamine-B assays. The spectrophotometric methods were adopted to study the effect against selected targets. Redox activity was assessed by in vitro antioxidant assays and the interaction study, ADMET profiling, and toxicity assessments were done in silico.  Results:   Isothymusin scavenges the radicals, i.e., DPPH and nitric oxide with moderate ferric reducing potential. It affected the proliferation of leukemia, colon, skin, and breast cancer cell lines by more than 50% but moderately affected prostate, kidney, lung, hepatic, and breast adenocarcinoma (up to 48%). Isothymusin inhibited the enzymes associated with the promotion stage of cancer, including cycloxygenase- 2 and lipoxygenase-5. Additionally, it also inhibited the activity of proliferation markers like cathepsin- D, dihydrofolate reductase, hyaluronidase, and ornithine-decarboxylase. Besides, in silico studies supported the in vitro enzyme inhibition assays outcome. Toxicity studies showed promising results of chemical descriptors and non-skin-irritant, moderate ocular-irritancy, and in vitro Ames test confirmed non-mutagenic nature.  Conclusion:   Isothymusin showed radical scavenging and anti-proliferative activities, which may be taken up as a phytochemical lead for the synthesis of analogues possessing enhanced anticancer potential.""","""['Shilpi Singh', 'Priyanka Kumari', 'Yusuf Hussain', 'Suaib Luqman', 'Abha Meena', 'Deepika Kanaojia']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Curr Top Med Chem""","""['Amino Acid Conjugates of Aminothiazole and Aminopyridine as Potential Anticancer Agents: Synthesis, Molecular Docking and in vitro Evaluation.', 'Synthesis and biological evaluation of purine-pyrazole hybrids incorporating thiazole, thiazolidinone or rhodanine moiety as 15-LOX inhibitors endowed with anticancer and antioxidant potential.', 'Molecular Docking, Antioxidant, Anticancer and Antileishmanial Effects of Newly Synthesized Quinoline Derivatives.', 'Molecular Dynamics and Biological Evaluation of 2-chloro-7-cyclopentyl- 7H-pyrrolo2,3-dpyrimidine Derivatives Against Breast Cancer.', 'Insights into the Pharmacological Effects of Flavonoids: The Systematic Review of Computer Modeling.', 'Quorum Quenching-Guided Inhibition of Mixed Bacterial Biofilms and Virulence Properties by Protein Derived From Leaves of Carissa carandas.']"""

Although LN-cells and cellular responses play a pivotal role in cancer metastasis, the interplay between LN-cells and PCa cells is undetermined due to the small size and widespread distribution of LNs. To identify factors responsible for LN metastasis, a 3D cell culture biosystem is fabricated to simulate LN responses during metastasis. First, it is determined that LN explants previously exposed to high metastatic PCa release substantially more chemotactic factors to promote metastatic PCa migration than those exposed to low-metastatic PCa. Furthermore, T-lymphocytes are found to produce chemotactic factors in LNs, among which, CXCL12, CCL21, and IL-10 are identified to have the most chemotactic effect. To mimic the LN microenvironment, Cytodex beads are seeded with T cells to produce a LN-mimetic biosystem in both static and flow conditions. As expected, the flow condition permits prolonged cellular responses. Interestingly, when PCa cells with varying metastatic potentials are introduced into the system, it produces PCa-specific chemokines accordingly. These results support that the LN mimetic helps in analyzing the processes underlying metastasized LNs and for testing various treatments to reduce cancer LN metastasis.""","""['Amirhossein Hakamivala', 'YiHui Huang', 'Yung-Fu Chang', 'Zui Pan', 'Ashwin Nair', 'Jer-Tsong Hsieh', 'Liping Tang']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Adv Biosyst""","""['Topography of lymph node metastases in prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and extended lymphadenectomy: results of a combined molecular and histopathologic mapping study.', 'The critical roles of tumor-initiating cells and the lymph node stromal microenvironment in human colorectal cancer extranodal metastasis using a unique humanized orthotopic mouse model.', 'Oncologic outcomes in men with metastasis to the prostatic anterior fat pad lymph nodes: a multi-institution international study.', 'Molecular patterns of cancer colonisation in lymph nodes of breast cancer patients.', 'The role of radical prostatectomy and lymph node dissection in lymph node-positive prostate cancer: a systematic review of the literature.', 'Correlation analysis between rim enhancement features of contrast-enhanced ultrasound and lymph node metastasis in breast cancer.']"""

Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1B (CPT1B) catalyzes the rate-limiting step of fatty acid oxidation. This study aimed to determine if CPT1B has a critical role in prostate cancer progression and to identify its regulatory mechanism.  Methods:   CPT1B expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus databases was compared with patient survival data. A tissue microarray was constructed with 60 samples of prostate cancer and immunohistochemically stained for CPT1B. Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cell lines 22RV1 and C4-2 in which CPT1B expression had been stably knocked down were established; and cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and invasion were investigated by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony formation assays, flow cytometry, and Transwell assays, respectively. To examine the impact of androgen receptor (AR) inhibition on CPT1B expression, JASPAR CORE was searched to identify AR-binding sites in CPT1B. Dual luciferase and ChIP assays were performed to confirm CPT1B activity and AR binding, respectively. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in prostate cancer underwent gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Enzalutamide-resistant C4-2 cells were generated and the mechanism of enzalutamide resistance and downstream signaling pathway changes of CPT1B to C4-2 was explored through CCK-8 test.  Results:   CPT1B expression was upregulated in human prostate cancer compared with normal prostate tissue and was associated with poor disease-free survival and overall survival. Silencing of CPT1B resulted in downregulated cell proliferation, reduced S-phase distribution, and lower invasive ability, whereas the opposite was observed in CRPC cells overexpressing CPTB1. DEGS in prostate cancer were correlated with G-protein-coupled receptor signaling, molecular transducer activity, and calcium ion binding. AR may regulate CPT1B expression and activity via specific binding sites, as confirmed by dual luciferase and ChIP assays. The CCK-8 experiment demonstrated that CPT1B overexpression in C4-2 cells did not significantly increase the ability of enzalutamide resistance. However, overexpression of CPT1B in C4-2R cells significantly increased the enzalutamide resistance. Upregulation of CPT1B expression increased AKT expression and phosphorylation.  Conclusions:   CPT1B is upregulated in prostate cancer and is correlated with poor prognosis, indicating its potential as a biomarker. AR inhibits the transcription of CPT1B. In the CRPC cell line, overexpression of CPT1B alone cannot promote enzalutamide resistance, but in the drug-resistant line C4-2R, overexpression of CPT1B can promote the resistance of C4-2R to enzalutamide.""","""['Mierxiati Abudurexiti', 'Wenkai Zhu', 'Yuchen Wang', 'Jun Wang', 'Wenhao Xu', 'Yongqiang Huang', 'Yao Zhu', 'Guohai Shi', 'Hailiang Zhang', 'Yiping Zhu', 'Yijun Shen', 'Bo Dai', 'Fangning Wan', 'Guowen Lin', 'Dingwei Ye']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['A novel androgen receptor antagonist JJ-450 inhibits enzalutamide-resistant mutant ARF876L nuclear import and function.', 'Alterations of androgen receptor-regulated enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) contribute to enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Restoration of the cellular secretory milieu overrides androgen dependence of in\xa0vivo generated castration resistant prostate cancer cells overexpressing the androgen receptor.', 'Enzalutamide: targeting the androgen signalling pathway in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Understanding the mechanisms of androgen deprivation resistance in prostate cancer at the molecular level.', 'NPRA promotes fatty acid metabolism and proliferation of gastric cancer cells by binding to PPARα.', 'Fatty acids metabolism affects the therapeutic effect of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 in tumor immune microenvironment in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'New insights into lipid metabolism and prostate cancer (Review).', 'Construction and validation of a fatty acid metabolism-related gene signature for predicting prognosis and therapeutic response in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Is There a Role of Warburg Effect in Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness?

Materials and methods:   Adult prostate cancer patients with radical prostatectomy were abstracted from the NIS. RARP and ORP were identified according to the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification procedure codes. The perioperative outcomes included blood transfusion, intraoperative and postoperative complications, prolonged length of stay (pLOS), and in-hospital mortality. Propensity score matching method and multivariable logistic regression model were performed to adjust for the pre-defined covariates. The annual percent change (APC) was used to detect the change trend of rates for outcomes.  Results:   A total of 77.054 patients were included in our study. According to the results of propensity score matching analyses, RARP outperformed ORP in blood transfusion (1.96% vs. 9.40%), intraoperative complication (0.73% vs. 1.25%), overall postoperative complications (8.87% vs. 11.97%), and pLOS (13.39% vs. 36.70%). We also found that there was a significant decreasing tendency of incidence in blood transfusion (APC=-9.81), intraoperative complication (APC=-12.84), and miscellaneous surgical complications (APC=-14.09) for the RARP group. The results of multivariable analyses were almost consistent with those of propensity score matching analyses.

The resistance exercise method whole-body electromyostimulation (WB-EMS) has a significant anti-cancer effect. WB-EMS-conditioned serum from advanced prostate cancer patients decreased human prostate carcinoma cell growth and viability in vitro. Multiplex analysis revealed that genes associated with human prostate cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis are sensitive for exercise. Feasible exercise should be part of multimodal anti-cancer therapies, also for physically weakened patients.  Abstract:   Regular physical activity is known to protect against cancer development. In cancer survivors, exercise reduces the risk of cancer recurrence and mortality. However, the link between exercise and decreased cancer risk and improved survival is still not well understood. Serum from exercising healthy individuals inhibits proliferation and activates apoptosis in various cancer cells, suggesting that mechanisms regulating cancer cell growth are affected by exercise. For the first time, we analysed serum from advanced-stage cancer patients with prostate (exercise group n = 8; control group n = 10) or colorectal (exercise n = 6; control n = 6) cancer, after a 12-week whole-body electromyostimulation training (20 min/session, 2×/week; frequency 85 Hz; pulse width 350 µs; 6 s stimulation, 4 s rest), a tolerable, yet effective, resistance exercise for physically weakened patients. We report that serum from these advanced cancer patients inhibits proliferation and enhances apoptosis of human prostate and colon cancer cells in vitro using cell growth and death assays (5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation, cell counting, DNA fragmentation). Exercise-mimicking electric pulse stimulation of human primary myotubes showed that electric pulse stimulation-conditioned myotube medium also impairs human cancer cell viability. Gene expression analysis using a multiplex array of cancer-associated genes and subsequent quantitative RT-PCR revealed the presence of exercise-sensitive genes in human prostate cancer cells that potentially participate in the exercise-mediated regulation of malignant cell growth and apoptosis. Our data document the strong efficiency of the anti-oncogenic effects of physical activity and will further support the application of regular therapeutic exercise during cancer disease.""","""['Raphaela Schwappacher', 'Kristin Schink', 'Svetlana Sologub', 'Walburga Dieterich', 'Dejan Reljic', 'Oliver Friedrich', 'Hans J Herrmann', 'Markus F Neurath', 'Yurdagül Zopf']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Physiol""","""['Physical activity and cancer biology: navigating a pathophysiological maze and broadening therapeutic imagination.', 'Muscle-Derived Cytokines Reduce Growth, Viability and Migratory Activity of Pancreatic Cancer Cells.', 'Effects of whole-body electromyostimulation combined with individualized nutritional support on body composition in patients with advanced cancer: a controlled pilot trial.', 'Effects of whole-body electromyostimulation exercise and caloric restriction on cardiometabolic risk profile and muscle strength in obese women with the metabolic syndrome: a pilot study.', 'Involvement of the multiple tumor suppressor genes and 12-lipoxygenase in human prostate cancer.

Our objective was to characterize the intratumoral immune balance of the malignant prostate after SBRT in patients.  Methods:   Sixteen patients with high-risk, non-metastatic prostate cancer at comparable Gleason Grade disease underwent radical prostatectomy with (n = 9) or without (n = 7) neoadjuvant SBRT delivered in three fractions of 8 Gy over 5 days completed 2 weeks before surgery. Freshly resected prostate specimens were processed to obtain single-cell suspensions, and immune-phenotyped for major lymphoid and myeloid cell subsets by staining with two separate 14-antibody panels and multicolor flow cytometry analysis.  Results:   Malignant prostates 2 weeks after SBRT had an immune infiltrate dominated by myeloid cells, whereas malignant prostates without preoperative treatment were more lymphoid-biased (myeloid CD45+ cells 48.4 ± 19.7% vs. 25.4 ± 7.0%; adjusted p-value = 0.11; and CD45+ lymphocytes 51.6 ± 19.7% vs. 74.5 ± 7.0%; p = 0.11; CD3+ T cells 35.2 ± 23.8% vs. 60.9 ± 9.7%; p = 0.12; mean ± SD).

Additionally, the pathobiology underlying disease heterogeneity remains poorly understood. As the role of cancer stem cells in the perpetuation of aggressive carcinoma is being substantiated by experimental evidence, it is crucially important to understand the molecular mechanisms, which regulate key features of cancer stem cells. We investigated two methods for in vitro cultivation of putative prostate cancer stem cells based on 'high-salt agar' and 'monoclonal cultivation'. Data demonstrated 'monoclonal cultivation' as the superior method. We demonstrated that 'holoclones' expressed canonical stem markers, retained the exclusive ability to generate poorly differentiated tumours in NOD/SCID mice and possessed a unique mRNA-miRNA gene signature. miRNA:Target interactions analysis visualised potentially critical regulatory networks, which are dysregulated in prostate cancer holoclones. The characterisation of this tumorigenic population lays the groundwork for this model to be used in the identification of proteomic or small non-coding RNA therapeutic targets for the eradication of this critical cellular population.

Nevertheless, there remains a paucity of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) with well-elucidated functional roles. Here, we leverage the International Cancer Genome Consortium-Early Onset Prostate Cancer transcriptome and identify the previously uncharacterized lncRNA LINC00920 to be upregulated in prostate tumors. Phenotypic characterization of LINC00920 revealed its positive impact on cellular proliferation, colony formation, and migration. We demonstrate that LINC00920 transcription is directly activated by ERG, an oncogenic transcription factor overexpressed in 50% of prostate cancers. Chromatin isolation by RNA purification-mass spectrometry revealed the interaction of LINC00920 with the 14-3-3ε protein, leading to enhanced sequestration of tumor suppressive FOXO1. Altogether, our results provide a rationale on how ERG overexpression, partly by driving LINC00920 transcription, could confer survival advantage to prostate cancer cells and potentially prime PTEN-intact prostate cells for cellular transformation through FOXO inactivation.

The outcomes of studies reporting mpMRI-targeted biopsies are dependent on the quality of the mpMRI but there are currently no scoring systems available for evaluating this. We introduced a novel scoring system, the Prostate Imaging Quality (PI-QUAL) score, to assess the quality of scans in the PRECISION trial. PI-QUAL is a score on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means that no mpMRI sequences are of diagnostic quality and 5 implies that each sequence is independently of optimal diagnostic quality. Fifty-eight out of 252 (23%) mpMRI scans chosen at random from each of the 22 centres in this trial were evaluated by two experienced radiologists from the coordinating trial centre, in consensus, blinded to pathology results. Overall, the mpMRI quality in the centres participating in PRECISION was good. MpMRI quality was of sufficient diagnostic quality (PI-QUAL ≥3) for 55 scans (95%) and of good or optimal diagnostic quality (PI-QUAL ≥4) for 35 scans (60%). Fifty-five out of 58 (95%) scans were of diagnostic quality for T2WI, followed by DWI (46/58 scans; 79%), and DCE (38/58 scans; 66%). Further validation of this scoring system is warranted. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this study we developed a scoring system (PI-QUAL) to assess the quality of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) in prostate cancer detection.

In 2018, 20,207 prostatectomies were performed in France, and few studies evaluated the perioperative habits of urologists. As part of writing guidelines for enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) we wished to evaluate practice of urologists in their hospital management of a prostatectomy.  Materiel and methods:   A questionnaire was sent by Survey Monkey in June and July 2018 to all urologists who are members of the French Association of Urology.  Results:   One hundred and sixty seven urologists (14%) answered the questionnaire, 62% have private practice. The average number of operators per center performing PT was 4, with a median number of 70 interventions (0 to 486) per center in 2018. Open surgery is still gold standard (39.13%), followed by the robot-assisted transperitoneal laparoscopic (34.78%) and standard laparoscopic (24.22%). Alimentation, like first stand-up, was re-established on the first post-operative day, and the average hospital stay was 4±2 nights. The removal of the bladder catheter was most often performed at home by nurse (49.06%), one week after surgery. Only 10.06% of urologists systematically perform a cystography before removal urinary catheter.  Conclusion:   The perioperative management of prostatectomy in France is relatively homogeneous, between urologists. The length of hospital stay remains important and could be reduced by proposing an ERAS protocol as has been obtained for cystectomy.

Previous studies have identified that the pro-inflammatory mediator interleukin-17F (IL-17F) aggravates the progression of several diseases. However, whether IL-17F plays a role in PCa is still lack of enough exploration. In this study, IL-17F expression was strikingly upregulated in PCa tissues. Treatment of IL-17F promoted cell viability at a dose-dependent manner. Further, functional assays were implemented by treatment of 100 ng/ml of IL-17F. Cell viability, proliferation, migration, invasion and stemness were promoted by 100 ng/ml of IL-17F. IL-17F increased the expression of p-PI3K and p-AKT in PCa cells, indicating that IL-17F might activate the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway in PCa cells. LY294002 (the inhibitor of the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway) could reverse the facilitating effects of IL-17F treatment on PCa cell viability, proliferation, migration, invasion and stemness.

Prior studies have analyzed trial termination, but it has not been easy to assess accrual estimates using international databases such as ClinicalTrials.gov because of limitations in accessing accrual information. Specifically, it is not easy to extract both anticipated and actual accrual of clinical trials. We designed a new algorithmic approach to extracting trial accrual data from ClinicalTrials.gov and used it to estimate the sufficiency of patient accrual onto genitourinary (GU) cancer trials.  Methods:   We queried ClinicalTrials.gov for completed/terminated phase II and III clinical trials for prostate, bladder, kidney, testicular, and ureteral cancers registered after 2007. We extracted trial characteristics from available XML files. We then used a Python algorithm to access prior trial registrations on the ClinicalTrials.gov archive site and extract both anticipated and actual accrual numbers. We then compared the actual accrual of each trial to its anticipated accrual and defined sufficient accrual as 85% of anticipated accrual.  Results:   The algorithm was 100% accurate compared with hand extraction in a small validation subset. A total of 925 trials were included, of which 840 (91%) had both anticipated and actual accrual. Only 418 (50%) trials had sufficient accrual (≥ 85% of anticipated). Considering only trials marked as successfully completed, 395/597 (66%) reached sufficient accrual.  Conclusion:   GU cancer trials often do not meet their anticipated accrual goals. New approaches to trial conduct are direly needed. Our reproducible and scalable approach to extracting accrual information can be applied to analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov in future analyses in the hope of improving the efficiency of the clinical trials enterprise.""","""['Kristian Stensland', 'Samuel Kaffenberger', 'David Canes', 'Matthew Galsky', 'Ted Skolarus', 'Alireza Moinzadeh']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""JCO Clin Cancer Inform""","""['Estimating the rate and reasons of clinical trial failure in urologic oncology.', 'Assessing clinical trial failure risk factors and reasons in gastric cancer.', 'Variation in Accrual and Race/Ethnicity Reporting in Urological and Nonurological Related Cancer Trials.', 'Analysis of factors leading to early termination in glioblastoma-related clinical trials.', 'Systematic review of interventional sickle cell trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov.', 'Exploring implementation outcomes in the clinical trial context: a qualitative study of physician trial stakeholders.', 'Evolving a national clinical trials learning health system.', 'Applying implementation frameworks to the clinical trial context.', 'Envisioning clinical trials as complex interventions.', 'Prostate cancer clinical trial completion: The role of geography.']"""

Black men have the highest incidence and mortality rates. Rates for Hispanic men are significantly lower than for non-Hispanic Whites. Whether differences in prevalences of modifiable risk and protective factors for prostate cancer may explain these racial/ethnic differences remains unclear.  Methods:   We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES), which are cross-sectional and nationally representative. We selected factors known or suspected to be associated with prostate cancer and calculated risk scores combining key factors. Age-adjusted means and proportions were calculated for each factor and risk score by race/ethnicity. We estimated odds ratios (OR) using polytomous logistic regression.  Results:   Prevalences of most factors are statistically significantly differed by race/ethnicity. In NHANES III, the prevalence of high risk score (i.e., > 25th percentile for all participants) was lower for all groups (non-Hispanic Black = 59.4%, non-US-born Mexican American = 51.4%, US-born Mexican American = 61.4%) vs. non-Hispanic White men (76.4%). Similar findings were observed for the fatal weighted risk score and for continuous NHANES.  Conclusions:   Our findings from this nationally representative study suggest that a combination of multiple risk and protective factors may help to explain the lower rates of prostate cancer in Mexican Americans. However, variation in these factors did not explain the higher risk of prostate cancer in non-Hispanic Black men. No one lifestyle change can reduce prostate cancer equally across all racial/ethnic groups, and modifiable factors may not explain the increased risk in black men at all.

Clinical decision-making requires prognostic markers that can be utilized at the time of diagnosis to identify aggressive tumors. Previous studies have shown a correlation between genomic alterations on the long arm of chromosome 18 (18q) and metastatic CaP.  Objective:   The goal of this study was to comprehensively profile copy number alterations found on 18q in prostate tumors with varying outcomes to identify putative biomarkers associated with more aggressive disease METHODS: A custom comparative genomic hybridization array was created composed of high-density tiling of 18q sequences. Primary prostate tumor tissues were gathered from men who underwent radical prostatectomy and were categorized based on the patient's long-term clinical outcome as either metastatic disease (MET) or no evidence of disease (NED). DNA was isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded prostatectomy tumor tissues, and analyzed for copy number variations (CNVs). Protein levels of genes found within the region of CNVs were analyzed using immunohistochemistry.  Results:   Thirty-Four primary prostate tumors were analyzed: 17 NEDs and 17 METs. Two significant regions of copy number gains were found on 18q associated with outcome. One gain located at 18q11.2 was found exclusively in NED outcome tumors while another gain, located at 18q21.31, was found exclusively in MET outcome tumors (P -value< 0.0076). Immunohistochemistry analysis of protein levels showed more protein associated with copy number gain in the MET samples vs. those without the gain as indicated by H-scores of 184.7 and 121.0 respectively.  Conclusions:   The latter of these CNVs represent a putative biomarker for aggressive disease and highlights a putative metastasis promoting gene. Further study of known connections to CaP suggests that the paracaspase MALT1 is the most likely target of the copy number gain and represents a potential therapeutic target. Future studies would be of interest to determine MALT1's role in aggressive CaP and the ability of this CNV region to differentiate CaP that will eventually metastasize.""","""['Keith A Ashcraft', 'Teresa L Johnson-Pais', 'Dean A Troyer', 'Javier Hernandez', 'Robin J Leach']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Identification of two distinct regions of allelic imbalance on chromosome 18Q in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Chromosome 8 markers of metastatic prostate cancer in African American men: gain of the MIR151 gene and loss of the NKX3-1 gene.', 'Genetic changes in clinically organ-confined prostate cancer by comparative genomic hybridization.', 'Translating a Prognostic DNA Genomic Classifier into the Clinic: Retrospective Validation in 563 Localized Prostate Tumors.', 'Angiogenesis, p53, bcl-2 and Ki-67 in the progression of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Integrative Analysis of MALT1 as a Potential Therapeutic Target for Prostate Cancer and its Immunological Role in Pan-Cancer.']"""

Here, we investigated the effect of combined NDRG2 overexpression, x-ray radiation (RTX), and docetaxel (DTX) against viability and invasiveness properties of LNCaP cells.  Material and methods:   A plasmid harboring NDRG2 gene under transcriptional control of prostate-specific enhancing sequence regulatory element was constructed to overexpress NDRG2 in PCa cell lines. The effects of NDRG2 overexpression in combination with RTX and DTX on viability, proliferation, and apoptosis of LNCaP cells were evaluated using MTT, colony formation, and annexin V flowcytometirc assays. Migration and invasion of NDRG2-overexpressed cells as well as expression of matrix metalloproteinses-2 (MMP2) and -9 (MMP9) were also assessed using transwell chamber assay and real-time PCR.  Results:   The results of fluorescence microscopy and real-time PCR showed a high and specific overexpression of NDRG2 in LNCaP cells.

Migration, invasion, as well as the expression of MMP2 and MMP9, was decreased following NDRG2 overexpression. Combination of NDRG2 overexpression with RTX and DTX decreased the viability, invasion, and migration of LNCaP cells synergistically.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is only temporarily effective for advanced-stage PCa, as the disease inevitably progresses to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The protein nucleolin (NCL) is overexpressed in several types of human tumors where it is also mislocalized to the cell surface. We previously reported the identification of a single-chain fragment variable (scFv) immuno-agent that is able to bind NCL on the surface of breast cancer cells and inhibit proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we evaluated whether NCL could be a valid therapeutic target for PCa, utilizing DU145, PC3 (CRPC), and LNCaP (androgen-sensitive) cell lines. First, we interrogated the publicly available databases and noted that higher NCL mRNA levels are associated with higher Gleason Scores as well as with recurrent and metastatic tumors. Then, using our anti-NCL scFv, we demonstrated that NCL is expressed on the surface of all three tested cell lines and that NCL inhibition results in reduced proliferation and migration. We also measured the inhibitory effect of NCL targeting on the biogenesis of oncogenic microRNAs such as miR-21, -221 and -222, which was cell context dependent.

Integrated SPECT/CT systems have the potential to improve the accuracy of patient-specific tumor dosimetry. We present a novel patient-specific Monte Carlo based voxel-wise dosimetry approach to determine organ and total tumor doses (TTD).  Methods:   13 patients with histologically confirmed metastasized castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated with a total of 18 cycles of [177Lu]PSMA-617 therapy. In each patient, dosimetry was performed after the first cycle of [177Lu]PSMA-617 therapy. Regions of interest were defined manually on the SPECT/CT images for the kidneys, spleen and all 295 PSMA-positive tumor lesions in the field of view. The absorbed dose to normal organs and to all tumor lesions were calculated by a three dimensional dosimetry method based on Monte Carlo Simulations.  Results:   The average dose values yielded the following results: 2.59 ± 0.63 Gy (1.67-3.92 Gy) for the kidneys, 0.79 ± 0.46 Gy (0.31-1.90 Gy) for the spleen and 11.00 ± 11.97 Gy (1.28-49.10 Gy) for all tracer-positive tumor lesions. A trend towards higher TTD was observed in patients with Gleason Scores > 8 compared to Gleason Scores ≤ 8 and in lymph node metastases compared to bone metastases. A significant correlation was determined between the serum-PSA level before RLT and the TTD (r = -0.57, p < 0.05), as well as between the TTD with the percentage change of serum-PSA levels before and after therapy was observed (r = -0.57, p < 0.05). Patients with higher total tumor volumes of PSMA-positive lesions demonstrated significantly lower kidney average dose values (r = -0.58, p < 0.05).

Here, an optimized method for TPs for a 1.5 T MR-linac was developed and implemented clinically. A static solid phantom and an MR-compatible 2D ionization chamber array were used. The array's response with respect to the incident beam gantry angles was characterized for four different orientations of the array relative to the beam. A lookup table was created identifying the optimum orientation for each gantry angle. For the QA of clinical MR-linac TPs, beams were grouped according to their gantry angles and measured with up to four setups. The method was applied to n = 106 clinical TPs of 54 patients for different tumour entities. Reference plans and plans created in the online adaptive workflow were analysed, using a local 3%/3 mm gamma criterion for dose values larger than 30% of the maximum. Pass rates were averaged over all beam groups. The array's response strongly depends on the beam incidence angle. Optimum angles typically range from -10° to 80° around the phantom setup angle. Consequently, plan verification required up to four setups. For clinical MR-linac TPs, the overall median pass rate was 98.5% (range 88.6%-100%). Pass rates depended on the tumour entity. Median pass rates were for liver metastases stereotactic body radiotherapy 99.2%, prostate cancer 99%, pancreatic cancer 98.9%, lymph node metastases 98.7%, partial breast irradiation (PBI) 98%, head-and-neck cancer 97.7%, rectal cancer 94% and others 96.6%. 85% of plans were accepted straightaway, with pass rates above 95%. A single plan with a pass rate below 90% was subsequently verified with a modified method. Off-axis target volumes, e.g. PBI, were verified successfully using a lateral shift of the phantom. The method is suitable to verify reference and online adapted TPs for a 1.5 T MR-linac, including plans for off-axis target volumes.""","""['David Mönnich', 'Jasmin Winter', 'Marcel Nachbar', 'Luise Künzel', 'Simon Boeke', 'Cihan Gani', 'Oliver Dohm', 'Daniel Zips', 'Daniela Thorwarth']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Two-dimensional EPID dosimetry for an MR-linac: Proof of concept.', 'Measurement validation of treatment planning for a MR-Linac.', 'A daily end-to-end quality assurance workflow for MR-guided online adaptive radiation therapy on MR-Linac.', 'Machine QA for the Elekta Unity system: A Report from the Elekta MR-linac consortium.', 'Primary treatment of prostate cancer using 1.5\xa0T MR-linear accelerator.', 'Clinical utility of a 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging-guided linear accelerator during conventionally fractionated and hypofractionated prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Clinical rationale for in vivo portal dosimetry in magnetic resonance guided online adaptive radiotherapy.', 'Commissioning measurements on an Elekta Unity MR-Linac.', 'Quality assurance for on-table adaptive magnetic resonance guided radiation therapy: A software tool to complement secondary dose calculation and failure modes discovered in clinical routine.', 'Use of magnetic resonance image-guided radiotherapy for breast cancer: a scoping review.']"""

The following method was adopted: AIP-SFFP generates a prostate IMRT plan through predictions of fluence maps using patient anatomy. No inverse planning is required. AIP-SFFP is centered on a custom-built deep learning (DL) neural network for fluence map prediction. Predictions are imported to a commercial treatment-planning system for dose calculation and plan generation. AIP-SFFP was demonstrated for prostate IMRT simultaneously-integrated-boost planning (58.8 Gy/70 Gy to PTV58.8 Gy/PTV70 Gy in 28 fx, PTV = Planning Target Volume). Training data was generated from 106 patients using a knowledge-based planning (KBP) plan generator. Two types of 2D projection images were designed to represent structures' sizes and locations, and a total of eight projections were utilized to describe targets and organs-at-risk. Projections at nine template beam angles were stacked as inputs for artificial intelligence (AI) training. 14 patients were used as independent tests. The generated test plans were compared with the plans from the KBP training plan generator and clinic practice. The following results were obtained: After normalization (PTV70 Gy V70 Gy = 95%), all 14 AI plans met institutional criteria. The coverage of PTV58.8 Gy in the AI plans was comparable to KBP and clinic plans without statistical significance. The whole body (BODY) D1cc and rectum D0.1cc of AI plans were slightly higher (<1 Gy) compared to KBP and clinic plans; in contrast, the bladder D1cc and other rectum and bladder low doses in the AI plans were slightly improved without clinical relevance. The overall isodose distribution in the AI plans was comparable with KBP plans and clinical plans. AIP-SFFP generated each test plan within 20s including the prediction and the dose calculation. In conclusion, AIP-SFFP was successfully developed for prostate IMRT planning. AIP-SFFP demonstrated good overall plan quality and real-time efficiency.

The interactive app Interaktor has been shown to reduce symptom burden during cancer treatment. It includes symptom assessment, an alert system for contact with health care professionals, access to self-care advice, and visualization of symptom history. It is essential to understand how digital interventions operate; one approach is to examine engagement by assessing usage and exploring user experiences. Actual usage in relation to the intended use-adherence-is an essential factor of engagement.  Objective:   This study aimed to describe engagement with the Interaktor app among patients with breast or prostate cancer during treatment.  Methods:   Patients from the intervention groups of two separate randomized controlled trials were included: patients with breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n=74) and patients with locally advanced prostate cancer receiving treatment with radiotherapy (n=75). The patients reported their symptoms daily. Sociodemographic and clinical data were obtained from baseline questionnaires and medical records. Logged data usage was retrieved from the server and analyzed descriptively and with multiple regression analysis. Telephone interviews were conducted with patients about their perceptions of using the app and analyzed using content analysis.  Results:   The median adherence percentage to daily symptom reporting was 83%. Most patients used the self-care advice and free text message component. Among the patients treated for breast cancer, higher age predicted a higher total number of free text messages sent (P=.04). Among the patients treated for prostate cancer, higher age (P=.01) and higher education level (P=.04), predicted an increase in total views on self-care advice, while higher comorbidity (P=.004) predicted a decrease in total views on self-care advice. Being married or living with a partner predicted a higher adherence to daily symptom reporting (P=.02). Daily symptom reporting created feelings of having continuous contact with health care professionals, being acknowledged, and safe. Being contacted by a nurse after a symptom alert was considered convenient and highly valued. Treatment and time-related aspects influenced engagement. Daily symptom reporting was perceived as particularly meaningful at the beginning of treatment. Requests were made for advice on diet and psychological symptoms, as well as for more comprehensive and detailed information as the patient progressed through treatment.  Conclusions:   Patient engagement in the interactive app Interaktor was high. The app promoted patient participation in their care through continuous and convenient contact with health care professionals. The predictive ability of demographic variables differed between patient groups, but higher age and a higher educational level predicted higher usage of specific app functions for both patient groups. Patients' experience of relevance and interactivity influenced their engagement positively.""","""['Marie-Therése Crafoord#', 'Maria Fjell#', 'Kay Sundberg', 'Marie Nilsson', 'Ann Langius-Eklöf']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Med Internet Res""","""['Correction: Engagement in an Interactive App for Symptom Self-Management during Treatment in Patients With Breast or Prostate Cancer: Mixed Methods Study.', 'Using an Interactive App for Symptom Reporting and Management Following Pancreatic Cancer Surgery to Facilitate Person-Centered Care: Descriptive Study.', 'Adherence to Report and Patient Perception of an Interactive App for Managing Symptoms During Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer: Descriptive Study of Logged and Interview Data.', 'Reduced symptom burden with the support of an interactive app during neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer - A randomized controlled trial.', 'mHealth Interventions for Self-management of Hypertension: Framework and Systematic Review on Engagement, Interactivity, and Tailoring.', 'Digital Mental Health Interventions for Depression: Scoping Review of User Engagement.', 'Are All Societies Ready for Digital Tools?

RBBP6 expression in PCa cells (LNCap, PC3, and DU145) and noncancerous prostate epithelial cells (RWPE-1) was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. PC3 and DU145 cells were transfected with RBBP6 small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to examine the biological characteristics. Anisomycin (a JNK activator) with/without RBBP6 siRNA was used to treat PC3 cells for further investigating the ramification of the RBBP6-mediated JNK pathway in PCa. PCa tissues and cells showed higher RBBP6 and JNK1/2 expression. RBBP6 was positively correlated with JNK1/2 in PCa tissues. Besides, RBBP6 expression was correlated to clinical tumor stage, lymph node metastasis, Gleason grade, preoperative prostate-specific antigen level, as well as prognosis of PCa.

In addition, migration and invasion decreased after the RBBP6 siRNA transfection with downregulated matrix metallopeptidase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9. Anisomycin promoted the proliferation, invasion, and migration of PC3 cells and inhibited PC3 cell apoptosis, which could be reversed by RBBP6 siRNA. RBBP6 expression was upregulated in PCa tissues and positively correlated with expression level of JNK1/2.

The goal of this study was to determine whether differences in glucose and pyruvate metabolism of human prostate cancer cells with dissimilar aggressivenesses can be detected using hyperpolarized [1-13 C]pyruvate MRS and [18 F]FDG-PET imaging, and to evaluate whether these measures correlate. For this purpose, we compared murine xenografts of human prostate cancer LNCaP cells with those of more aggressive PC3 cells. [1-13 C]pyruvate was hyperpolarized by dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (dDNP) and [1-13 C]pyruvate to lactate conversion was followed by 13 C MRS. Subsequently [18 F]FDG uptake was investigated by static and dynamic PET measurements. Standard uptake values (SUVs) for [18 F]FDG were significantly higher for xenografts of PC3 compared with those of LNCaP. However, we did not observe a difference in the average apparent rate constant kpl of 13 C label exchange from pyruvate to lactate between the tumor variants. A significant negative correlation was found between SUVs from [18 F]FDG PET measurements and kpl values for the xenografts of both tumor types. The kpl rate constant may be influenced by various factors, and studies with a range of prostate cancer cells in suspension suggest that LDH inhibition by pyruvate may be one of these. Our results indicate that glucose and pyruvate metabolism in the prostate cancer cell models differs from that in other tumor models and that [18 F]FDG-PET can serve as a valuable complementary tool in dDNP studies of aggressive prostate cancer with [1-13 C]pyruvate.""","""['Frits H A van Heijster', 'Sandra Heskamp', 'Vincent Breukels', 'Andor Veltien', 'Gerben M Franssen', 'Kees C F J Jansen', 'Otto C Boerman', 'Jack A Schalken', 'Tom W J Scheenen', 'Arend Heerschap']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""NMR Biomed""","""['Combined hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate MRS and 18F-FDG PET (hyperPET) estimates of glycolysis in canine cancer patients.', 'Simultaneous Hyperpolarized 13C-Pyruvate MRI and 18F-FDG PET (HyperPET) in 10 Dogs with Cancer.', 'Hyperpolarized 1-13Cdehydroascorbate MR spectroscopy in a murine model of prostate cancer: comparison with 18F-FDG PET.', 'PET of Glucose Metabolism and Cellular Proliferation in Prostate Cancer.', 'Is There Use for FDG-PET in Prostate Cancer?', 'Harnessing Lactate Metabolism for Radiosensitization.', 'Dynamic Nuclear Polarization of Silicon Carbide Micro- and Nanoparticles.', 'Resistance to Androgen Deprivation Leads to Altered Metabolism in Human and Murine Prostate Cancer Cell and Tumor Models.']"""

The early identification of who will progress on AA/P is limited.  Objective:   This study investigates the role of prostate surface antigen (PSA) kinetics as a predictor of progression in mHSPC patients treated with AA/P.  Patients and methods:   All patients with mHSPC who initiated androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and AA/P from June 2017 to February 2019 at the Cleveland Clinic were eligible. PSA-mCRPC was defined as a PSA rise at two consecutive time points. Patients were followed until first mCRPC or last contact after AA/P. Patterns of PSA change were evaluated using a longitudinal mixed model at time 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months from AA/P initiation. The association between PSA profile at 3 months and PSA-mCRPC was examined using survival analysis. Radiographic progression (Rad-mCRPC) was also analyzed.  Results:   A total of 130 men with follow-up were included. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) follow-up time was 15.3 (10.5, 22.5) months. Eighty-two percent were Caucasian (median age 68.5 years); participants had a median (IQR) PSA of 16.8 (5.3, 48.0) ng/mL. Half of the patients had de novo disease, and 46.2% had high-risk disease (61% had a Gleason score ≥ 8, 16% had visceral disease, and 54% had three or more bony lesions). The greatest PSA percentage reduction from baseline after AA/P initiation occurred at the first 3 months (median 98.3%). The reduction at 6-12 months from baseline was small (99.7-100%). Patients without PSA-mCRPC had a significantly greater 3-month reduction of PSA values compared to patients who developed PSA-mCRPC (p interaction = 0.0002). 50.8% of patients were able to achieve a non-detectable PSA (median 13.1 months). PSA-mCRPC (n = 20) was observed from 4 to 24 months after AA/P, with the majority of events occurring within the first 12 months. Patients with PSA < 0.3 ng/mL (12-month PSA-mCRPC-free 94.5% vs. 69.4%, p = 0.0004) or a ≥ 98% reduction (94.9% vs. 68.0%, p = 0.0002) at 3 months had better PSA-mCRPC-free survival compared to their counterparts. Absolute reduction at 3 months was not associated with PSA-mCRPC. Similar PSA patterns were seen in those who had Rad-mCRPC compared to no Rad-mCRPC (p interaction < 0.05).  Conclusion:   The degree of PSA decline at 3 months predicted serologic progression to mCRPC. Those who developed castration-resistant disease had higher PSA and a lower percentage reduction by 3 months. Tracking early PSA pattern changes may alert clinicians to poor treatment effect and potential progression; they should consider frequent PSA measurement and imaging, as well as the initiation of sequential therapy.""","""['Iris Y Sheng', 'Jaleh Fallah', 'Ruby Gupta', 'Hong Li', 'Kimberly Allman', 'Allison Martin', 'Pedro Barata', 'Moshe C Ornstein', 'Timothy D Gilligan', 'Brian I Rini', 'Jorge A Garcia']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Target Oncol""","""['Evaluation of Response to Enzalutamide Consecutively After Abiraterone Acetate/Prednisone Failure in Patients With Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Exploring the Clinical Benefit of Docetaxel or Enzalutamide After Disease Progression During Abiraterone Acetate and Prednisone Treatment in Men With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Switch from abiraterone plus prednisone to abiraterone plus dexamethasone at asymptomatic PSA progression in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Abiraterone for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Use of abiraterone acetate in the treatment of patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer and no prior chemotherapy: 3 case reports and literature review.', 'The slope associated with nadir prostate-specific antigen is prognostically significant in men with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer after primary androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Multi-institutional Analysis of the Clinical and Genomic Characteristics of Black Patients with Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer.']"""

We evaluated a smaller antibody fragment, the minibody, with faster kinetics and a potentially improved therapeutic index.  Procedures:   The anti-prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) minibody (A11 Mb) was radiolabeled with iodine-124 ([124I]I-A11 Mb) or conjugated with deferoxamine (DFO) and labeled with zirconium-89 ([89Zr]Zr-DFO-A11 Mb) for surrogate immunoPET to profile pharmacokinetics in a human prostate cancer xenograft model. Subsequently, minibodies labeled with two therapeutic beta emitters, directly iodinated [131I]I-A11 Mb (non-residualizing) and 177Lu chelated using DTPA ([177Lu]Lu-DTPA-A11 Mb) (residualizing), were compared for in vitro antigen-specific cytotoxicity. Full biodistribution studies (in 22Rv1-PSCA tumor bearing and hPSCA knock-in mice) were conducted for dosimetry calculations. Finally, the lead candidate [131I]I-A11 Mb was evaluated in a radioimmunotherapy experiment. Escalating single doses (3.7, 11, or 37 MBq) and saline control were administered to 22Rv1-PSCA tumor bearing mice and anti-tumor effects (tumor volume) and toxicity (body weight) were monitored.  Results:   Minibodies radiolabeled with therapeutic beta emitters [131I]I-A11 Mb and [177Lu]Lu-DTPA-A11 Mb exhibited comparable tumor cell growth inhibition in vitro. In vivo surrogate immunoPET imaging using [89Zr]Zr-DFO-A11 Mb showed activity retention in liver and kidney up to 72 h, while [124I]I-A11 Mb cleared from liver, kidney, and blood by 48 h. Based on full biodistribution and dosimetry calculations, administering 37 MBq [131I]I-A11 Mb was predicted to deliver a favorable dose to the tumor (35 Gy), with a therapeutic index of 22 (tumor:bone marrow). For [177Lu]Lu-DTPA-A11 Mb, the kidneys would be dose-limiting, and the maximum tolerated activity (7.4 MBq) was not predicted to deliver an effective radiation dose to tumor. Radioimmunotherapy with a single dose of [131I]I-A11 Mb showed dose-dependent tumor inhibition with minimal off-target toxicity and improved median survival (19 and 24 days, P < 0.001) compared with untreated mice (12 days).

Approximately 90% of patients with advanced disease will develop bone metastasis, which dramatically reduces long-term survival. Therefore, effective therapies need to be developed, especially when disease is still well-localized. Phospholipase D (PLD), an enzyme that hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine to yield phosphatidic acid, regulates several cellular functions as proliferation, survival, migration or vesicular trafficking. PLD is implicated in numerous diseases such as neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, autoimmune disorders or cancer. Indeed, PLD controls different aspects of oncogenesis including tumor progression and resistance to targeted therapies such as radiotherapy. PLD1 and PLD2 are the only isoforms with catalytic activity involved in cancer. Surprisingly, studies deciphering the role of PLD in the pathophysiology of PCa are scarce. Here we describe the correlation between PLD activity and PLD1 and PLD2 expression in PCa bone metastasis-derived cell lines C4-2B and PC-3. Next, by using PLD pharmacological inhibitors and RNA interference strategy, we validate the implication of PLD1 and PLD2 in cell viability, clonogenicity and proliferation of C4-2B and PC-3 cells and in migration capacity of PC-3 cells. Last, we show an increase in PLD activity as well as PLD2 protein expression during controlled starvation of PC-3 cells, concomitant with an augmentation of its migration capacity. Specifically, upregulation of PLD activity appears to be PKC-independent. Taken together, our results indicate that PLD, and in particular PLD2, could be considered as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of PCa-derived bone metastasis.""","""['Mathieu Borel', 'Olivier Cuvillier', 'David Magne', 'Saida Mebarek', 'Leyre Brizuela']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Cell Biochem""","""['Prostate cancer-derived exosomes promote osteoblast differentiation and activity through phospholipase D2.', 'Phospholipase D inhibitors reduce human prostate cancer cell proliferation and colony formation.', 'Phosphatidic acid, phospholipase D and tumorigenesis.', 'Proliferative and metastatic roles for Phospholipase D in mouse models of cancer.', 'Structure and regulation of human phospholipase D.', 'mTOR-Rictor-EGFR axis in oncogenesis and diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme.']"""

Results:   Our results highlight the limited biological effectiveness of Auger electrons, as short path length radiation, with increasing distances to DNA. The evaluation of the radiation-induced biological effects was complemented with a comparative microdosimetric study based on intracellular dose values. The comparative study, between MIRD and Monte Carlo (MC) methods used to assess the cellular doses, revealed that efforts should be made in order to standardize the bioeffects modeling for DNA-incorporated Auger electron emitters.  Conclusions: 99mTc might not be the ideal radionuclide for Auger therapy but can be useful to validate the design of new classes of Auger-electron emitting radioconjugates. In this context, our results highlight the crucial importance of the distance of Auger electron emitters to the target DNA and encourage the development of strategies for the fine tuning of the distance to DNA for other medical radionuclides (e.g., 111In or 161Tb) in order to enhance their radiotherapeutic effects within the Auger therapy of cancer.""","""['Ana Belchior', 'Salvatore Di Maria', 'Célia Fernandes', 'Pedro Vaz', 'António Paulo', 'Paula Raposinho']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""EJNMMI Res""","""['Searching for a Paradigm Shift in Auger-Electron Cancer Therapy with Tumor-Specific Radiopeptides Targeting the Mitochondria and/or the Cell Nucleus.', 'Evaluation of Acridine Orange Derivatives as DNA-Targeted Radiopharmaceuticals for Auger Therapy: Influence of the Radionuclide and Distance to DNA.', 'The effect of hypoxia on the induction of strand breaks in plasmid DNA by alpha-, beta- and Auger electron-emitters 223Ra, 188Re, 99mTc and DNA-binding 99mTc-labeled pyrene.', 'Auger electrons for cancer therapy - a review.', '(99m)Tc Auger electrons for targeted tumour therapy: a review.', 'Preparation and Evaluation of Thermosensitive Liposomes Encapsulating I-125-Labeled Doxorubicin Derivatives for Auger Electron Therapy.', 'Searching for a Paradigm Shift in Auger-Electron Cancer Therapy with Tumor-Specific Radiopeptides Targeting the Mitochondria and/or the Cell Nucleus.', 'Relationship of In Vitro Toxicity of Technetium-99m to Subcellular Localisation and Absorbed Dose.', 'Biological Effects Associated with Internal and External Contamination of Diagnostic Nuclear Medicine Sources: An In vitro Study.', 'Metal-Based G-Quadruplex Binders for Cancer Theranostics.']"""

We aimed to determine whether this increase is a result of more men being managed conservatively or rather a higher proportion of the diminishing number of low-risk PCa managed this way.  Methods:   The SEER ""Prostate Watchful Waiting Database"" identified men managed initially with conservative management between 2010 and 2016. Men > 40 years old who were diagnosed with low-risk (Gleason score 3 + 3, T1-T2a, PSA level < 10 ng/mL) PCa were included. Age-standardized and age-specific PCa incidence and conservative management rates were calculated per 100,000 man-years. The annual percent change in rates for the entire time period was also calculated.  Results:   The incidence of low-risk PCa declined by 11.8% per year (95% confidence interval [CI] -15.4% to -8.0%), whereas the number of men assigned to conservative management for low-risk disease did not increase significantly, rising by +3.7% per year (95% CI -0.7% to 8.4%). In age-specific analysis, the number of men < 60 years and those who were 60-69 years managed conservatively increased by +9.6% per year (95% CI 2.7% to 16.9%) and 4.5% per year (95% CI 0.1% to 9.1%), respectively, whereas the number of men ≥ 70 years electing conservative management remained stable at -4% per year (95% CI -11.2% to 3.7%).

Moreover, TAAA tandem repeats have been suggested to be associated with the regulation of PCA3 expression and, in turn, to be related with the development of the disease. The aim of the study was to understand thegenetic basis of the disease in search for a better diagnosis. Expression levels of PCA3 gene were analysed in tissue of 13 patients diagnosed with PCa and six patients diagnosed with a benign prostatic disease (BPD). The absolute expression of PCA3 was quantified by real-time PCR. Genotype for TAAA tandem repeats was measured using automatic sequencing and the results were analysed to determine whether an association existed between them. We identified three alleles: 4, 5, 6 and four genotypes: 4/5, 5/5, 5/6, 6/6. Our analysis identified amutation in the nucleotide 76764237 of the PCA3 gene that generates an extra TAAA tandem repeat.

The effect of AR modulation on AR+ nontumor cells that participate in the resistance to AR antagonism is poorly understood. Tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells, including macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), express AR and promote prostate cancer progression. We investigated how AR antagonism affects myeloid cell function and metabolism in an AR-independent murine colon tumor model. Systemic blockade of AR with enzalutamide resulted in increased MC-38 tumor growth in vivo even when AR was knocked out of MC-38 tumor cells. MC-38 tumor growth was also increased when immunocompetent, but not immunodeficient, mice were coinjected with tumor cells and MDSCs treated with enzalutamide or lacking AR, suggesting that AR regulated the ability of MDSCs to suppress adaptive immunity. Myeloid AR-knockout male mice also displayed increased growth of TRAMP C2 prostate tumors when compared with wild type. Inhibition of AR signaling suppressed mitochondrial respiration in myeloid cells via MPC/AMPK signaling pathways; suppression of mitochondrial respiration increased MDSC tumor-promoting functions. Our work showed that AR regulates a tumor-promoting myeloid cell phenotype and influences myeloid cell metabolism.

However, it remains unclear how many cores should be applied per target.  Objective:   To assess sPC detection rates of two different target-dependent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-fusion biopsy approaches (TB and target saturation [TS]) compared with extended systematic biopsies (SBs).  Design, setting, and participants:   Retrospective single-centre outcome of transperineal MRI/TRUS-fusion biopsies of 213 men was evaluated. All men underwent TB with a median of four cores per MRI lesion, followed by a median of 24 SBs, performed by experienced urologists. Cancer and sPC (International Society of Urological Pathology grade group ≥2) detection rates were analysed. TB was compared with SB and TS, with nine cores per target, calculated by the Ginsburg scheme and using individual cores of the lesion and its ""penumbra"".  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Cancer detection rates were calculated for TS, TB, and SB at both lesion and patient level. Combination of SB + TB served as a reference. Statistical differences in prostate cancer (PC) detection between groups were calculated using McNemar's tests with confidence intervals.  Results and limitations:   TS detected 99% of 134 sPC lesions, which was significantly higher than the detection by TB (87%, p = 0.001) and SB (82%, p < 0.001). SB detected significantly more of the 72 low-risk PC lesions than TB (99% vs 68%, p < 0.001) and 10% (p = 0.15) more than that detected by TS. At a per-patient level, 99% of men harbouring sPC were detected by TS. This was significantly higher than that by TB and SB (89%, p = 0.03 and 81%, p = 0.001, respectively). Limitations include limited generalisability, as a transperineal biopsy route was used.  Conclusions:   TS detected significantly more cases of sPC than TB and extended SB. Given that both 99% of sPC lesions and men harbouring sPC were identified by TS, the results suggest that this approach allows to omit SB cores without compromising sPC detection.

The framework included a probabilistic treatment planning technique in the effort to yield dose distributions with an improved expected treatment outcome compared with uniform-dose planning approaches.  Methods:   IMRT plans were generated for five prostate cancer patients using two inverse planning methods: uniform-dose to the planning target volume and probabilistic biological optimisation for clinical target volume tumour control probability (TCP) maximisation. Patient-specific tumour location and clonogen density information were derived from mpMRI and geometric uncertainties were incorporated in the TCP calculation. Potential reduction in dose to sensitive structures was assessed by comparing dose metrics of uniform-dose plans with biologically-optimised plans of an equivalent level of expected tumour control.  Results:   The planning study demonstrated biological optimisation has the potential to reduce expected normal tissue toxicity without sacrificing local control by shaping the dose distribution to the spatial distribution of tumour characteristics. On average, biologically-optimised plans achieved 38.6% (p-value: < 0.01) and 51.2% (p-value: < 0.01) reduction in expected rectum and bladder equivalent uniform dose, respectively, when compared with uniform-dose planning.  Conclusions:   It was concluded that varying the dose distribution within the prostate to take account for each patient's clonogen distribution was feasible. Lower doses to normal structures compared to uniform-dose plans was possible whilst providing robust plans against geometric uncertainties. Further validation in a larger cohort is warranted along with considerations for adaptive therapy and limiting urethral dose.""","""['E J Her', 'A Haworth', 'H M Reynolds', 'Y Sun', 'A Kennedy', 'V Panettieri', 'M Bangert', 'S Williams', 'M A Ebert']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Focal dose escalation for prostate cancer using 68Ga-HBED-CC PSMA PET/CT and MRI: a planning study based on histology reference.', 'Effect on therapeutic ratio of planning a boosted radiotherapy dose to the dominant intraprostatic tumour lesion within the prostate based on multifunctional MR parameters.', 'Prostate cancer tumour control probability modelling for external beam radiotherapy based on multi-parametric MRI-GTV definition.', 'Treatment planning optimisation in proton therapy.', 'PET-guided prostate cancer radiotherapy: technological innovations for dose delivery optimisation.', 'Radiomic assessment of oesophageal adenocarcinoma: a critical review of 18F-FDG PET/CT, PET/MRI and CT.', 'A statistical, voxelised model of prostate cancer for biologically optimised radiotherapy.', 'Biologically Targeted Radiation Therapy: Incorporating Patient-Specific Hypoxia Data Derived from Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging.', 'Robust dose-painting-by-numbers vs. nonselective dose escalation for non-small cell lung cancer patients.']"""

Although lower doses are established alternatives based on randomized controlled trials, the safety and efficacy of 25 and 20 mg/m2 in real-world settings are not well established. Therefore, we investigated the safety and efficacy of cabazitaxel at the recommended starting dose or a lower dose (20 mg/m2) in real-world clinical practice.  Methods:   We compared the safety and efficacy of cabazitaxel between patients who received cabazitaxel at starting doses of 25 and 20 mg/m2 (C25 and C20, respectively) in a Japanese post-marketing surveillance study of 662 patients with docetaxel-refractory CRPC. Safety was assessed in terms of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate, overall survival (OS), and time-to-treatment failure (TTF) were compared between the C25 and C20 groups in unmatched patients and after applying propensity score matching.  Results:   The C20 and C25 groups comprised 190 and 159 patients without matching and 112 patients per group after matching. In unmatched patients, any-grade (C25 vs C20: 89.3% vs 78.4%, Fisher's p < 0.01) and grade ≥ 3 (81.1% vs 61.1%) ADRs were more frequent in the C25 group. Neutropenia (any grade: 61.6% vs 54.2%; grade ≥ 3: 55.3% vs 42.6%) and febrile neutropenia (grade ≥ 3: 30.2% vs 14.7%) were more frequent in the C25 group. In matched patients, the PSA response rate (reduction in PSA ≥30% from a baseline ≥5 ng/mL) was 26.4 and 32.0% in the C20 and C25 groups, respectively, median OS was 291 days (95% CI 230-not reached) versus not reached (hazard ratio 0.73, 95% CI 0.50-1.08), and TTF favored C25 (hazard ratio 0.75, 95% CI 0.57-0.99).  Conclusions:   Clinicians should consider the patient's risk of clinically significant ADRs and prophylactic granulocyte colony stimulating factor when selecting the starting dose of cabazitaxel for CRPC. Some patients at high risk of ADRs or unfit patients may benefit from a lower starting dose of 20 mg/m2, whereas fit patients may be candidates for a starting dose of 25 mg/m2.

We investigated the role of EGF on the expression of these enzymes since it interacts with signalling pathways to also affect prostate tumour progression and is additionally associated with decreased DNA methylation. The expression of UGT2B15, UGT2B17, de novo methyltransferases, DNMT3A and DNMT3B was assessed in prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) treated with EGF, an EGFR inhibitor PD16893, and the methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-azacytidine, respectively. The results showed that EGF treatment decreased levels of expression of all four genes and that their expression was reversed by PD16893. Treatment with 5-azacytidine, markedly decreased expression of UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 over 85% as well as significantly decreased expression of DNMT3B, but not the expression of DNMT3A. DNMT3B siRNA treated LNCaP cells had decreased expression of UGT2B15 and UGT2B17, while DNMT3A siRNA treated cells had only moderately decreased UGT2B15 expression. Treatment with DNMT methyltransferase inhibitor, RG108, significantly decreased UGT2B17 expression. Additionally, methylation differences between prostate cancer samples and benign prostate samples from an Illumina 450K Methylation Array study were assessed. The results taken together suggest that hypomethylation of the UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 genes contributes to increased risk of prostate cancer and may provide a putative biomarker or epigenetic target for chemotherapeutics.

Methods and materials:   From March 2016 to March 2019, 25 patients were enrolled in a prospective single institution trial (ACTRN12617000035325). Eligibility criteria included patients with biopsy proven isolated prostate recurrence after definitive irradiation, with concordant multiparametric MRI and 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT findings, and a prostate-specific antigen of less than 15 ng/mL at the time of recurrence. The study included a sequential dose escalation component with the first 18 patients receiving 36 Gy in 6 fractions on alternate days with subsequent patients receiving 38 Gy in 6 fractions assuming acceptable toxicity.  Results:   Median age was 72 years (range, 62-83) with a median time between first radiation treatment and salvage SBRT of 8.3 years (range, 4.5- 13.6). Median prostate-specific antigen at reirradiation was 4.1 (range, 1.1-16.6). The median follow-up was 25 months (range, 13-46).

The prostate with BPH exhibits enhanced growth not only in the epithelium but also in the stroma, and stromal-epithelial interactions are thought to play an important role in BPH pathogenesis. However, our understanding of the mechanisms of stromal-epithelial interactions in the development and progression of BPH is very limited.  Methods:   Matched pairs of glandular BPH and normal adjacent prostate specimens were obtained from BPH patients undergoing simple prostatectomy for symptomatic BPH. Tissues were divided further into fresh specimens for culture of primary prostatic stromal cells, and specimens were embedded in paraffin for immunohistochemical analyses. Proliferation assays, immunohistochemistry, and immunoblotting were used to characterize the primary prostate stromal cells and tissue sections. Coculture of the primary stromal cells with benign human prostate epithelial cell lines BHPrE1 or BPH-1 was performed in three-dimensional (3D) Matrigel to determine the impact of primary stromal cells derived from BPH on epithelial proliferation. The effect of stromal-conditioned medium (CM) on BHPrE1 and BPH-1 cell growth was tested in 3D Matrigel as well.  Results:   BPH stromal cells expressed less smooth muscle actin and calponin and increased vimentin, exhibiting a more fibroblast and myofibroblast phenotype compared with normal adjacent stromal cells both in culture and in corresponding paraffin sections. Epithelial spheroids formed in 3D cocultures with primary BPH stromal cells were larger than those formed in coculture with primary normal stromal cells. Furthermore, CM from BPH stromal cells stimulated epithelial cell growth while CM from normal primary stromal cells did not in 3D culture.  Conclusions:   These findings suggest that the stromal cells in BPH tissues are different from normal adjacent stromal cells and could promote epithelial cell proliferation, potentially contributing to the development and progression of BPH.""","""['Wei Chen', 'Laura E Pascal', 'Ke Wang', 'Rajiv Dhir', 'Alexa M Sims', 'Robert Campbell', 'Gwenyth Gasper', 'Donald B DeFranco', 'Naoki Yoshimura', 'Zhou Wang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Elevated epithelial expression of interleukin-8 correlates with myofibroblast reactive stroma in benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'A system for studying epithelial-stromal interactions reveals distinct inductive abilities of stromal cells from benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'Regulation of proliferation and differentiation of prostatic stromal cells by oestradiol through prostatic epithelial cells in a paracrine manner.', 'Androgen receptor roles in the development of benign prostate hyperplasia.', 'Role of the stromal microenvironment in carcinogenesis of the prostate.', 'Simvastatin Improves Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: Role of Peroxisome-Proliferator-Activated Receptor-γ and Classic WNT/β-Catenin Pathway.', 'Changes in the Expression and Functional Activities of C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 13 (CXCL13) in Hyperplastic Prostate.', 'Increased COX-1 expression in benign prostate epithelial cells is triggered by mitochondrial dysfunction.', 'Integrated analysis reveals FOXA1 and Ku70/Ku80 as targets of ivermectin in prostate cancer.', 'The Etiology and Pathophysiology Genesis of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Prostate Cancer: A New Perspective.']"""

The ability to reprogram normal tissue epithelial cells into prostate or mammary stem-like cells holds great promise to help understand cell of origin and lineage plasticity in prostate and breast cancers in addition to understanding normal gland development. We previously showed that an intracellular chemokine, CXCL12γ induced cancer stem cells and neuroendocrine characteristics in both prostate and breast adenocarcinoma cell lines. However, its role in normal prostate or mammary epithelial cell fate and development remains unknown. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the functional role of CXCL12γ in the regulation of ESCs and tissue development.  Methods:   Prostate epithelial cells (PNT2) or mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A) with overexpressed CXCL12γ was characterized by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blots, and immunofluorescence for lineage marker expression, and fluorescence activated cell sorting analyses and sphere formation assays to examine stem cell surface phenotype and function. Xenotransplantation animal models were used to evaluate gland or acini formation in vivo.  Results:   Overexpression of CXCL12γ promotes the reprogramming of cells with a differentiated luminal phenotype to a nonluminal phenotype in both prostate (PNT2) and mammary (MCF10A) epithelial cells. The CXCL12γ-mediated nonluminal type cells results in an increase of epithelial stem-like phenotype including the subpopulation of EPCAMLo /CD49fHi /CD24Lo /CD44Hi cells capable of sphere formation. Critically, overexpression of CXCL12γ promotes the generation of robust gland-like structures from both prostate and mammary epithelial cells in in vivo xenograft animal models.

Methods:   We categorized 2004-2015 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database patients by risk group (low, favorable intermediate, unfavorable intermediate, high, and very highrisk). Using the Fine-Gray method, we calculated the relative burden of 10-year PCSM attributable to each risk group.  Results:   Among N = 337 162 men (6.8-year median follow-up; median age 65 years), the relative proportion of low-, favorable intermediate-, unfavorable intermediate-, high-, and very high-risk diagnoses were 29.9% (N = 100 969), 31.1% (N = 104 696), 17.9% (N = 60 360), 18.1% (N = 61 023), and 3.0% (N = 10 114).

National Comprehensive Cancer Network® guidelines recommend active surveillance, prostatectomy or radiotherapy. Recent trials demonstrated no difference in prostate cancer specific mortality for men undergoing active surveillance for low risk prostate cancer compared to prostatectomy or radiotherapy. The use of active surveillance for intermediate risk prostate cancer is less clear. In this study we characterize U.S. national trends for demographic, clinical and socioeconomic factors associated with active surveillance for men with intermediate risk prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   This retrospective cohort study examined 176,122 men diagnosed with intermediate risk prostate cancer from 2010 to 2016 in the National Cancer Database. Temporal trends in demographic, clinical and socioeconomic factors among men with intermediate risk prostate cancer and association with the use of active surveillance were characterized. The analysis was performed in April 2020.  Results:   In total, 176,122 men were identified with intermediate risk prostate cancer from 2010 to 2016. Of these men 57.3% underwent prostatectomy, 36.4% underwent radiotherapy and 3.2% underwent active surveillance. Active surveillance nearly tripled from 1.6% in 2010 to 4.6% in 2016 (p <0.001). On multivariate analysis use of active surveillance was associated with older age, diagnosis in recent years, lower Gleason score and tumor stage, type of insurance, treatment at an academic center and proximity to facility, and attaining higher education (p <0.05).

Among patients with prostate cancer (PCa), findings on depression and anxiety are limited.  Methods:   We analyzed data of PCa patients selected from a German multi-center study. Depression and anxiety were assessed with the PHQ-9 and the GAD-7 (cut-off ≥7). We provided physical symptom burden, calculated absolute and relative risk (AR and RR) of depression and anxiety across patient subsets and between patients and the general population (GP) and tested age as a moderator within the relationship of disease-specific symptoms with depression and anxiety.  Results:   Among 636 participants, the majority reported disease-specific problems (sexuality: 60%; urination: 52%). AR for depression and anxiety was 23% and 22%, respectively. Significant RR were small, with higher risks of distress in patients who are younger (eg, RRdepression = 1.15; 95%-CI: 1.06-1.26), treated with chemotherapy (RRdepression = 1.46; 95%-CI: 1.09-1.96) or having metastases (RRdepression = 1.30; 95%-CI: 1.02-1.65). Risk of distress was slightly elevated compared to GP (eg, RRdepression = 1.13; 95%-CI: 1.07-1.19). Age moderated the relationship between symptoms and anxiety (Burination = -0.10, P = .02; Bsexuality = -0.11, P = .01).  Conclusions:   Younger patients, those with metastases or treatment with chemotherapy seem to be at elevated risk for distress and should be closely monitored. Many patients suffer from disease-specific symptom burden, by which younger patients seem to be particularly distressed.

Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanisms responsible for PCSLCs expansion has broadly scientific interest. Here, our results revealed that lncRNA HOTAIR could increase PCSLCs population via activating STAT3 signaling. Mechanistically, HOTAIR functioned as miR-590-5p sponge and prevented it from targeting the 3'UTR of IL-10, one upstream molecule of STAT3 signaling, leading to IL-10 upregulation and STAT3 activation. We also found that HOTAIR was required and sufficient to cause Docetaxel resistance (DocR) in C4-2 PCa cells.

However, the phylogenetic trees that they report differ significantly between tumors (even those with similar characteristics).  Results:   In this article, we present a novel combinatorial optimization method, CONETT, for detection of recurrent tumor evolution trajectories. Our method constructs a consensus tree of conserved evolutionary trajectories based on the information about temporal order of alteration events in a set of tumors.

A major challenge is that clinical data (i.e. patients) with drug response outcome is very limited, creating a need for transfer learning to bridge the gap between large pre-clinical pharmacogenomics datasets (e.g. cancer cell lines), as a source domain, and clinical datasets as a target domain. Two major discrepancies exist between pre-clinical and clinical datasets: (i) in the input space, the gene expression data due to difference in the basic biology, and (ii) in the output space, the different measures of the drug response. Therefore, training a computational model on cell lines and testing it on patients violates the i.i.d assumption that train and test data are from the same distribution.  Results:   We propose Adversarial Inductive Transfer Learning (AITL), a deep neural network method for addressing discrepancies in input and output space between the pre-clinical and clinical datasets. AITL takes gene expression of patients and cell lines as the input, employs adversarial domain adaptation and multi-task learning to address these discrepancies, and predicts the drug response as the output. To the best of our knowledge, AITL is the first adversarial inductive transfer learning method to address both input and output discrepancies. Experimental results indicate that AITL outperforms state-of-the-art pharmacogenomics and transfer learning baselines and may guide precision oncology more accurately.

Dose differences between the original and reconstructed dose distributions were within 3% at the isocenter and observed in PTV and organ-at-risk (OAR) regions.

Reductionist strategies focusing on individual nutrients or foods have not clearly defined risk factors. We have developed mechanisms-based dietary patterns focusing upon inflammation and chronic insulin hypersecretion, processes that are hypothesized to impact prostate carcinogenesis. In the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian cancer cohort, we calculated the empirical dietary index for hyperinsulinemia (EDIH) and empirical dietary inflammatory pattern (EDIP) scores from food frequency questionnaire data among 3,517 men and women who provided a blood sample at enrollment. We used these scores in multivariable-adjusted linear regression to validate EDIH and EDIP against relevant circulating biomarkers. In a separate sample of 49,317 men, we used multivariable-adjusted Cox regression to evaluate associations of EDIH and EDIP with prostate cancer (total and subtypes) risk. Participants consuming the most hyperinsulinemic diets (EDIH quintile 5) had significantly higher concentrations of C-peptide, insulin, c-reactive protein, TNFα-R2, and lower adiponectin, than those in quintile 1. Similarly, participants consuming the most proinflammatory diets had significantly higher concentrations of IL6, TNFα-R2, C-peptide, insulin, and lower adiponectin. Men consuming hyperinsulinemic diets were at higher total prostate cancer risk: HRquintile5vs1, 1.11; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-1.23; P trend = 0.03, especially high-grade cancer: HRquintile5vs1, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.02-1.37; P trend = 0.06. The EDIP was not associated with prostate cancer risk. In summary, EDIH and EDIP predicted concentrations of known insulinemic and inflammatory biomarkers, and EDIH further predicted risk of future prostate cancer.

Results and limitations:   PCa was found in 113/159 (71%) men, with 49% (78/159) having clinically significant cancer (csPCa; ISUP ≥ 2). Micro-US-targeted biopsies resulted in a higher ISUP grade group than the nontargeted biopsies in 26% (42/159), compared with both nontargeted and MRI-targeted biopsies in 16% (26/159). In 17% (27/159) of patients, targeted mpMRI-guided biopsy was negative with cancer identified in the micro-US-guided biopsy, of whom 20 had csPCa. The comparison with only MRI-positive patients is the main limitation of this analysis.  Conclusions:   Our data show an added benefit of micro-US in addition to mpMRI-targeted biopsies in a population of men at risk of PCa. A novel biopsy protocol with solely targeted biopsy with micro-US and mpMRI seems possible, replacing conventional ultrasound and omitting standard systematic biopsies.  Patient summary:   In this report, we looked at the performance of microultrasound in the setting of diagnosing prostate cancer. We found that microultrasound is a good addition to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the prostate and presents an alternative for men who may not undergo MRI.""","""['Laura Wiemer', 'Markus Hollenbach', 'Robin Heckmann', 'Beatrice Kittner', 'Henning Plage', 'Max Reimann', 'Patrick Asbach', 'Frank Friedersdorff', 'Thorsten Schlomm', 'Sebastian Hofbauer', 'Hannes Cash']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Assessing the Role of High-resolution Microultrasound Among Naïve Patients with Negative Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging and a Persistently High Suspicion of Prostate Cancer.', 'Diagnostic Accuracy of Microultrasound in Patients with a Suspicion of Prostate Cancer at Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Single-institutional Prospective Study.', 'Head-to-head Comparison of Transrectal Ultrasound-guided Prostate Biopsy Versus Multiparametric Prostate Resonance Imaging with Subsequent Magnetic Resonance-guided Biopsy in Biopsy-naïve Men with Elevated Prostate-specific Antigen: A Large Prospective Multicenter Clinical Study.', 'What Is the Negative Predictive Value of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Excluding Prostate Cancer at Biopsy?

The clinical significance of ≥50% PBC for patients with high-risk disease is poorly understood. We examined the association between ≥50% PBC, compared to <50% PBC, and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) for patients with high-risk disease.  Materials and methods:   We identified 7,569 men from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program who were diagnosed with high-risk CaP (Gleason score of 8-10, prostate-specific antigen >20 ng/mL, or cT3-T4 stage) in 2010-2011 and had 6 to 24 cores sampled at biopsy. Multivariable Fine and Gray competing risks regression was utilized to examine the association between ≥50% PBC and PCSM.  Results:   Median follow-up was 3.8 years. 56.2% of patients (4,253) had ≥50% PBC. On competing risks regression, ≥50% PBC was associated with a significantly higher risk of PCSM compared to <50% PBC (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 2.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.48-2.70, P < 0.001). On subgroup analyses, ≥50% PBC was associated with a significantly higher risk of PCSM only for cT1-T2 disease (AHR 2.23, 95% CI 1.62-3.07) but not cT3-T4 disease (AHR 0.83, 95% CI 0.39-1.76), with a significant interaction (Pinteraction = 0.016). No significant interactions by Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen level, use of definitive therapy, or number of biopsy cores sampled were observed.  Conclusion:   In this large cohort of patients with high-risk CaP, ≥50% PBC was independently associated with an approximately 2-fold increased risk of PCSM for patients with cT1-T2, but not cT3-T4, tumors.

Methods: The clinical data of patients who had undergone AUS implantation in multiple medical centers between March and July 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Data of urethral pressure profilometry, pad usage, related scores and complications related to surgery were collected and compared. The primary endpoint was social continence (defined as 0-1 pad/d) 1 month after activation of the pump. Results: A total of five male patients were included in this study. Two underwent transurethral resection of the prostate for benign prostatic hyperplasia, two underwent radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer, and one underwent urethral reunion, urethral stricture dilatation and cystostomy due to trauma from traffic accident. All patients had different degrees of urinary incontinence. The results of preoperative urethral profilometry test showed that the MUP of five patients were 52, 53, 88, 32, and 66 cmH(2)O(1 cmH(2)O=0.098 kPa), respectively, and the MUCP were 17, 52, 62, 27, and 40 cmH(2)O, respectively.

However, the number and effectiveness of quality indicators is under debate, and may influence the joy in work of physicians and nurses. Empirical data on the nature and consequences of the registration burden are lacking. The aim of this study was to identify and explore healthcare professionals' perceived burden due to quality registrations in hospitals, and the effect of this burden on their joy in work.  Methods:   A mixed methods observational study, including participative observations, a survey and semi-structured interviews in two academic hospitals and one teaching hospital in the Netherlands. Study participants were 371 healthcare professionals from an intensive care unit (ICU), a haematology department and others involved in the care of elderly patients and patients with prostate or gastrointestinal cancer.  Results:   On average, healthcare professionals spend 52.3 minutes per working day on quality registrations. The average number of quality measures per department is 91, with 1380 underlying variables. Overall, 57% are primarily registered for accountability purposes, 19% for institutional governance and 25% for quality improvement objectives. Only 36% were perceived as useful for improving quality in everyday practice. Eight types of registration burden were identified, such as an excessive number of quality registrations, and the lack of usefulness for improving quality and inefficiencies in the registration process. The time healthcare professionals spent on quality registrations was not correlated with any measure of joy in work. Perceived unreasonable registrations were negatively associated with healthcare professionals' joy in work (intrinsic motivation and autonomy). Healthcare professionals experienced quality registrations as diverting time from patient care and from actually improving quality.  Conclusion:   Registering fewer quality indicators, but more of what really matters to healthcare professionals, is key to increasing the effectiveness of registrations for quality improvement and governance. Also the efficiency of quality registrations should be increased through staffing and information and communications technology solutions to reduce the registration burden experienced by nurses and physicians.""","""['Marieke Zegers', 'Gepke L Veenstra', 'Gerard Gerritsen', 'Rutger Verhage', 'Hans J G van der Hoeven', 'Gera A Welker']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Health Policy Manag""","""['Complex Governance Does Increase Both the Real and Perceived Registration Burden: The Case of the Netherlands Comment on ""Perceived Burden Due to Registrations for Quality Monitoring and Improvement in Hospitals: A Mixed Methods Study"".', 'More Evidence That the Healthcare Administrative Burden Is Real, Widespread and Has Serious Consequences Comment on ""Perceived Burden Due to Registrations for Quality Monitoring and Improvement in Hospitals: A Mixed Methods Study"".', 'Purpose, Subject, and Consumer Comment on ""Perceived Burden Due to Registrations for Quality Monitoring and Improvement in Hospitals: A Mixed Methods Study"".', 'Time spent on documenting quality indicator data and associations between the perceived burden of documenting these data and joy in work among professionals in intensive care units in the Netherlands: a multicentre cross-sectional survey.', 'Complex Governance Does Increase Both the Real and Perceived Registration Burden: The Case of the Netherlands Comment on ""Perceived Burden Due to Registrations for Quality Monitoring and Improvement in Hospitals: A Mixed Methods Study"".', 'More Evidence That the Healthcare Administrative Burden Is Real, Widespread and Has Serious Consequences Comment on ""Perceived Burden Due to Registrations for Quality Monitoring and Improvement in Hospitals: A Mixed Methods Study"".', ""Health professionals' experience of teamwork education in acute hospital settings: a systematic review of qualitative literature."", ""The impact of the inpatient practice of continuous deep sedation until death on healthcare professionals' emotional well-being: a systematic review."", 'Time spent on documenting quality indicator data and associations between the perceived burden of documenting these data and joy in work among professionals in intensive care units in the Netherlands: a multicentre cross-sectional survey.', 'Effects of Lean Interventions Supported by Digital Technologies on Healthcare Services: A Systematic Review.', 'Putting measurement on a diet: development of a core set of indicators for quality improvement in the ICU using a Delphi method.', ""Electronic health record implementation and healthcare workers' work characteristics and autonomous motivation-a before-and-after study."", 'Time to See Quality Measurement Differently: Focus on Reflection, Learning and Improvement; A Response to the Recent Commentaries.']"""

Methods:   Twenty prostate radiotherapy patients received planning computed tomography (CT) and MRI scans and were treated with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Two bulk densities were set, one for bone and one for soft tissue. The bone contours were created by using ABS followed by manual modification if considered necessary. A range of soft tissue and bone density pairs, between 0.95 and 1.03 g/cm3 with increments of 0.01 for soft tissue, and between 1.15 and 1.65 g/cm3 with increments of 0.05 for bone, were evaluated. Using the density pair giving the lowest dose difference compared to the CT-based dose, dose differences were calculated using both the manually modified bone contours and the bone contours from ABS. Contour overlap measurements between the ABS contours and the manually modified contours were calculated.  Results:   The dose comparison shows a very good agreement with the CT when using 0.98 g/cm3 for soft tissue and 1.20 g/cm3 for bone, with a dose difference less than 1 % in average dose in all regions of interest. The mean Dice similarity coefficient for bone was 0.94 and the Mean Distance to Agreement was <1 mm in most cases.  Conclusions:   Using bulk density assignment on MR images with suitable densities for bone and soft tissue results in clinically acceptable dose differences compared to dose calculated on the CT, for both atlas-based and manual bone contours. This demonstrates that an integrated MRI-only pathway utilizing a bulk density assignment for two tissue types is a feasible and robust approach for patients with prostate cancer treated with VMAT.""","""['Hazel Mhairi McCallum', 'Sebastian Andersson', 'Jonathan James Wyatt', 'Neil Richmond', 'Christopher Paul Walker', 'Stina Svensson']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['MRI-guided prostate radiation therapy planning: Investigation of dosimetric accuracy of MRI-based dose planning.', 'Dosimetric evaluation of synthetic CT relative to bulk density assignment-based magnetic resonance-only approaches for prostate radiotherapy.', 'An atlas-based electron density mapping method for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-alone treatment planning and adaptive MRI-based prostate radiation therapy.', 'Evaluation of a multi-atlas CT synthesis approach for MRI-only radiotherapy treatment planning.', 'Systematic Review of Synthetic Computed Tomography Generation Methodologies for Use in Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Only Radiation Therapy.', 'Evaluation of a commercial synthetic computed tomography generation solution for magnetic resonance imaging-only radiotherapy.']"""

However, there is limited research identifying factors associated with supportive needs after the completion of PCa treatment. This study aimed to identify the social and medical risk factors associated with supportive needs for adapting among individuals who completed treatment for localized PCa.  Methods:   Using baseline data from a study evaluating a web-based support system for patients in the first year following treatment for localized PCa, self-efficacy for re-entry (e.g., maintaining relationships, symptom management), medical interactions, and practical concerns (e.g., insurance, exercise) were assessed. Multivariable regression analyses were completed to identify risk factors for low readiness.  Results:   Participants (N = 431) with lower health literacy or income or with depressive symptoms had lower self-efficacy for re-entry, more negative interactions with medical providers, and more practical concerns (ps < .05). Lastly, non-Hispanic White participants reported greater readiness compared with all other races (ps < .05).  Conclusions:   Multiple social and medical risk factors are associated with greater supportive needs when adapting to new roles after PCa treatment. Understanding the risk factors for supportive needs in this period is critical. Future research is needed to help providers identify and support individuals at risk for poorer coping and greater practical concerns after treatment completion.

Canonically, MYC up-regulation in luminal prostate cancer cells functions to oppose the terminally differentiating effects of AR. However, the effects of MYC up-regulation are pleiotropic and inconsistent with a poorly proliferative phenotype. Here we show that increased MYC expression and activity are associated with the down-regulation of MEIS1, a HOX-family transcription factor. Using RNA-seq to profile a series of human prostate cancer specimens laser capture microdissected on the basis of MYC immunohistochemistry, MYC activity, and MEIS1 expression were inversely correlated. Knockdown of MYC expression in prostate cancer cells increased the expression of MEIS1 and increased the occupancy of MYC at the MEIS1 locus. Finally, we show in laser capture microdissected human prostate cancer samples and the prostate TCGA cohort that MEIS1 expression is inversely proportional to AR activity as well as HOXB13, a known interacting protein of both AR and MEIS1. Collectively, our data demonstrate that elevated MYC in a subset of primary prostate cancers functions in a negative role in regulating MEIS1 expression, and that this down-regulation may contribute to MYC-driven development and progression.""","""['Nichelle C Whitlock', 'Shana Y Trostel', 'Scott Wilkinson', 'Nicholas T Terrigino', 'S Thomas Hennigan', 'Ross Lake', 'Nicole V Carrabba', 'Rayann Atway', 'Elizabeth D Walton', 'Berkley E Gryder', 'Brian J Capaldo', 'Huihui Ye', 'Adam G Sowalsky']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['HOXB13 interaction with MEIS1 modifies proliferation and gene expression in prostate cancer.', 'MEIS1 functions as a potential AR negative regulator.', 'MEIS-mediated suppression of human prostate cancer growth and metastasis through HOXB13-dependent regulation of proteoglycans.', 'Transcriptional Regulation in Prostate Cancer.', 'MEIS1 and its potential as a cancer therapeutic target (Review).', 'Polymorphisms within DIO2 and GADD45A genes increase the risk of liver disease progression in chronic hepatitis b carriers.', 'A Systematic Pan-Cancer Analysis of MEIS1 in Human Tumors as Prognostic Biomarker and Immunotherapy Target.', 'Ubiquitin specific peptidases and prostate cancer.', 'Progression of prostate cancer reprograms MYC-mediated lipid metabolism via lysine methyltransferase 2A.', 'miR-20a-5p inhibits proliferation of lung cancer A549 cells by down-regulating HOXB13.']"""

Chromatin-conformation capture and dCas9 mediated enhancer blocking establish a direct regulatory link between this enhancer and lncRNAs PCAT1, PRNCR1 and PVT1. The risk allele ('T') is associated with higher expression of PCAT1, PVT1 and c-myc in prostate tumors.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the occurrence of urinary incontinence (UI) and erectile dysfunction (ED) in daily clinical practice using a nationwide Dutch cohort of patients with localized or locally advanced CaP.  Basic procedures:   Patients were invited to complete the EPIC-26 questionnaire before treatment (baseline) and at 12 and 24 months after diagnosis. We calculated the mean EPIC-26 domain scores, stratified by treatment modality (i.e., radical prostatectomy, external radiotherapy, and no active treatment), and the proportions of patients with UI (defined as ≥ 2 pads per day) and ED (defined as erections not firm enough for sexual intercourse). Logistic regression modeling was used to explore the factors related to UI and ED after surgery.  Main findings:   In total 1,759 patients participated in this study. Patients undergoing radical prostatectomy experienced clinically relevant worsening in the urinary incontinence domain. After excluding patients who reported UI at baseline, 15% of patients with prostatectomy reported UI 24 months after diagnosis. Only comorbidity was associated with UI in surgically treated patients. Regardless of treatment, patients reported a clinically significant reduced sexual functioning over time. Before treatment, 54% of patients reported ED. Among the 46% remaining patients, 87% of patients treated with radical prostatectomy reported ED 24 months after diagnosis, 41% after radiotherapy, and 46% in patients without active treatment. Bilateral nerve-sparing surgery was the only factor associated with ED after 24 months.  Principal conclusions:   UI and ED frequently occur in patients with localized and locally advanced CaP, in particular after radical prostatectomy. The higher occurrence rate of UI and ED, compared with clinical trial participants, supports the importance of real-world data, which can be used for local treatment recommendations and patient information, but also to evaluate effects of future initiatives, such as treatment centralization and research aimed at improving functional outcomes.""","""['R W M Vernooij', 'R G H M Cremers', 'H Jansen', 'D M Somford', 'L A Kiemeney', 'G van Andel', 'B P Wijsman', 'M B Busstra', 'R J A van Moorselaar', 'E M Wijnen', 'F J Pos', 'M C C M Hulshof', 'P Hamberg', 'F van den Berkmortel', 'C A Hulsbergen-van de Kaa', 'G J L H van Leenders', 'J J Fütterer', 'I M van Oort', 'K K H Aben']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Corrigendum to ""Urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction in patients with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer: A nationwide observational study"".', 'The Relationship Between Incontinence and Erectile Dysfunction After Robotic Prostatectomy: Are They Mutually Exclusive?', 'Treatment of post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction: there is insufficient utilisation of care in German cancer survivors.', 'Do we need the nerve sparing radical prostatectomy techniques (intrafascial vs. interfascial) in men with erectile dysfunction?

Methods:   Thirty seven prostate patients treated with IMRT or VMAT were included in this retrospective study. DRR images were generated for all MLC segments/control points using the TPS. The MLC leaf pattern of each control point was overlaid on the DRR, and the number of fiducials within the MLC opening was analyzed. EPID images of fiducials in a pelvic phantom were obtained to demonstrate the fiducial visibility during modulated beam delivery.  Results:   Gold fiducials were visible on EPID images. The probability of seeing a number of fiducials within the MLC opening was analyzed. At least one fiducial was visible during 42 ± 2% and 52 ± 2% beam-on time for IMRT of the prostate with and without lymph nodes, and during 81 ± 4% and 80 ± 5% beam-on time for VMAT of the prostate with and without lymph nodes, respectively. The mean time interval to observe at least one fiducial was 8.4 ± 0.7 and 5.9 ± 0.5 s for IMRT of the prostate with and without the lymph nodes, respectively, and 1.6 ± 0.1 s for VMAT prostate patients. The estimated potential dosimetric uncertainty was 7% and 2% for IMRT and VMAT, respectively.  Conclusions:   Our results demonstrated that the time and frequency to observe fiducial markers in MLC-modulated fields during IMRT/VMAT beam delivery were adequate for real-time prostate localization.

A national survey of the brachytherapy study group of the Belgian SocieTy for Radiotherapy and Oncology (BeSTRO)""","""Purpose:   To explore the current practices patterns and evaluate the actual brachytherapy (BT) resources in Belgium.  Material and methods:   In 2019, the Brachytherapy Study Group proposed to conduct a survey on behalf of the Belgian SocieTy of Radiation Oncology (BeSTRO) in order to identify current BT practice patterns. An electronic questionnaire was sent to all primary radiotherapy centers in Belgium. This questionnaire was based on the questionnaire that was used by the Italian Association of Radiation Oncology (AIRO) in 2016, asking for: (a) General information on the Radiation Oncology Centre; (b) BT equipment and human resources; (c) BT procedures; (d) BT assessment (number of patients treated annually, treated sites, and different modalities of treatments).  Results:   All 24 radiation oncology centers (100% response rate) answered the questionnaire and gave also information on the performance of brachytherapy in their (eventual) satellite centers. Eighteen (18) BT afterloader units were installed and operational in 2018. Thirteen centers mentioned a prostate seed implant program, one center a prostate and eye plaque program and one center only an eye plaque program. Less than 50% of centers have the infrastructure to offer the full-range of BT in their own department. In 2018, 1486 patients received a BT-treatment, 28% of them were treated by prostate seed implant, 8% were treated by eye-(seed) BT and 64% by high dose rate (HDR)/pulsed dose rate (PDR) BT. Forty-five percent of HDR/PDR patients were treated by vaginal dome BT, 22% by intra-uterine BT, 11% by skin BT, 10% by breast BT (almost exclusively in one centre), 8% for benign pathology (keloid) and the remaining 4% were treated for prostate (as a boost or as salvage in one centre), anal, penile, lung or oesophageal cancer.  Conclusions:   Belgian radiotherapy departments often perform BT only in a (highly) selected group of pathologies, resulting in a limited number of patients treated by this technique despite the sufficient availability of BT equipment. Modern indications are often not covered, hence patients do not have regular access to recognized treatment options, possibly leading to inferior oncological outcome. BeSTRO will use the results of this survey to stimulate improvements in training, awareness, education, implementation, collaboration and cooperation in the field of brachytherapy.""","""['Carl Salembier', 'Olivier De Hertogh', 'Jean-François Daisne', 'Samuel Palumbo', 'Dirk Van Gestel']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Status report of Hungarian radiotherapy based on treatment data, available infrastucture, and human resources.', 'A national survey of AIRO (Italian Association of Radiation Oncology) brachytherapy (Interventional Radiotherapy) study group.', 'Salvage brachytherapy for locally-recurrent prostate cancer after radiation therapy: A comparison of efficacy and toxicity outcomes with high-dose rate and low-dose rate brachytherapy.', 'Does an Algorithmic Approach to Using Brachytherapy and External Beam Radiation Result in Good Function, Local Control Rates, and Low Morbidity in Patients With Extremity Soft Tissue Sarcoma?', 'Recommendations of the Spanish brachytherapy group of the Spanish Society of Radiation Oncology and the Spanish Society of Medical Physics for interstitial high-dose-rate brachytherapy for gynaecologic malignancies.', 'Why is a very easy, useful, old technique underused?

Bone metastasis is a leading cause of pain and increases the risk of skeletal-related events (SREs) in cancer patients. In addition to affecting the quality of life, it also increases the medical costs and mortality risk. We aimed to examine the occurrence of bone metastasis and SREs in Korean cancer patients using a nationwide health database. Using claims data from the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (2002-2013), we extracted the data of bone metastasis patients diagnosed with any of the seven major cancers in Korea from January 2002 to December 2010. Selected SREs included pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, radiation therapy, and palliative bone surgery. We used time-to-event analysis to estimate patient survival after bone metastasis. A total of 21,562 newly diagnosed cancer patients were identified; bone metastases developed in 1,849 patients (breast cancer, 18.8%; prostate cancer, 17.5%; lung cancer, 13.7%). The median time from primary cancer diagnosis to bone metastasis was 18.9 months. The cumulative incidence of SREs was 45.1% in all bone metastasis patients. The most common cancer type was lung cancer (53.4%), followed by liver (50.9%), prostate (45.9%), breast (43.6%), and colorectal (40.2%) cancers. Almost all SREs developed 1 month after bone metastasis, except in patients with breast and prostate cancers (median: 5.9 months in breast cancer and 4.7 months in prostate cancer). Survival duration after the development of bone metastasis was < 6 months in stomach, liver, colorectal, and lung cancer patients. Breast and prostate cancer patients survived for > 1 year after the occurrence of SREs.

It has been proven that WFDC2 promotes proliferation and metastasis in ovarian cancer, and serves as a diagnostic biomarker. However, the specific function of WFDC2 in prostate cancer has not been reported. Here, we first screened the diagnostic marker and favorable prognostic factor WFDC2 in prostate cancer by bioinformatics. WFDC2 expression was negatively correlated with Gleason score and metastasis in prostate cancer. Then, we revealed that overexpression of WFDC2, and addition of recombinant protein HE4 can significantly inhibit prostate cancer metastasis in vivo and in vitro. By co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization assays, we proved that WFDC2 binds to the extracellular domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Immunoblot showed that WFDC2 overexpression and recombinant protein HE4 addition inactivated the EGFR/AKT/GSK3B/Snail signaling pathway, and then restrained the progression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

Now the detailed role and molecular mechanism of PCa development are largely unknown. Here we showed that the expression of HSD17B4 was increased in PCa tissues compared to paired paratumor tissues. HSD17B4 knockdown in PCa cells significantly suppressed its proliferation, migration and invasion, while overexpressing HSD17B4 had opposite effects. Mechanistically, we found that the protein level of HSD17B4 was regulated by its acetylation at lysine 669(K669). Dihydroxytestosterone (DHT) treatment increased HSD17B4 acetylation and then promoted its degradation via chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). SIRT3 directly interacted with HSD17B4 to inhibit its acetylation and enhance its stability. In addition, we identified CREBBP as a regulator of the K669 acetylation and degradation of HSD17B4, affecting PC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Notably, in PCa tissues and paired paratumor tissues, the level of HSD17B4 was negatively correlated with its K669 acetylation. Taken together, this study identified a novel role of HSD17B4 in PCa progression and suggested that HSD17B4 and its upstream regulators may be potential therapeutic targets for PCa intervention.""","""['Huichao Huang', 'Ruijie Liu', 'Yahui Huang', 'Yilu Feng', 'Ying Fu', 'Lin Chen', 'Zhuchu Chen', 'Yi Cai', 'Ye Zhang', 'Yongheng Chen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Aging (Albany NY)""","""['Acetylation targets HSD17B4 for degradation via the CMA pathway in response to estrone.', 'NF-κB increased expression of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 4 promotes HepG2 proliferation via inactivating estradiol.', 'The biological functions and mechanism of miR‑212 in prostate cancer proliferation, migration and invasion via targeting Engrailed-2.', 'SIRT7 depletion inhibits cell proliferation and androgen-induced autophagy by suppressing the AR signaling in prostate cancer.', 'Developing antineoplastic agents that target peroxisomal enzymes: cytisine-linked isoflavonoids as inhibitors of hydroxysteroid 17-beta-dehydrogenase-4 (HSD17B4).', 'Susceptibility to Colorectal Cancer Based on HSD17B4 rs721673 and rs721675 Polymorphisms and Alcohol Intake among Taiwan Biobank Participants: A Retrospective Case Control Study Using the Nationwide Claims Data.', 'Effects of High-Fat Diet on Cardiovascular Protein Expression in Mice Based on Proteomics.', 'A prediction model for prognosis of gastric adenocarcinoma based on six metabolism-related genes.', 'Micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) and a proteomic profile in lung adenocarcinoma cases with brain metastasis.', 'Effects of Semaglutide on Cardiac Protein Expression and Cardiac Function of Obese Mice.']"""

Methods:   This was a prospective study of suspected prostate cancer patients who were evaluated with CETRUS followed by a prostate biopsy. Prostate blood flow via CETRUS was graded using a 5-point scale. The relationship between CETRUS score and biopsy outcome was then analyzed for all patients; univariate and multi-variate analyses were used to determine the probable prognostic factors for biochemical recurrence in patients with localized prostate cancer that underwent a radical prostatectomy.  Results:   A total of 347 patients were enrolled in the study. Prostate cancer was found in 164 patients. A significant positive correlation (r = 0.69, p < 0.001) was found between CETRUS scores and prostate cancer incidence. Using CETRUS scores ≥2 as the threshold for when to biopsy could have safely reduced the number of biopsies taken overall by 12.1% (42/347) and spared 23.0% (42/183) of patients from undergoing an unnecessary biopsy. 77 patients with localized prostate cancer underwent a radical prostatectomy. The median follow-up time was 30 months (range: 8-56 months) and 17 of these 77 patients exhibited biochemical recurrence during the follow-up period. 3-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rates were 86% for patients with low CETRUS scores (≤ 3) and 59% for patients with high scores (> 3; p = 0.015).

Methods:   Retrospectively, 73 patients were included in the study. The patients (mean age, 66.3 ± 7.6 years) were examined with multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) prior to radical prostatectomy (n = 33) or targeted biopsy (n = 40). The index lesion was annotated in MRI ADC and the equivalent histologic slides according to the highest Gleason Grade Group (GrG). Volumes of interest (VOIs) were determined for each lesion and normal-appearing peripheral zone. VOIs were processed by radiomic analysis. For the classification of lesions according to their clinical significance (GrG ≥ 3), principal component (PC) analysis, univariate analysis (UA) with consecutive support vector machines, neural networks, and random forest analysis were performed.  Results:   PC analysis discriminated between benign and malignant prostate tissue. PC evaluation yielded no stratification of PCa lesions according to their clinical significance, but UA revealed differences in clinical assessment categories and radiomic features. We trained three classification models with fifteen feature subsets. We identified a subset of shape features which improved the diagnostic accuracy of the clinical assessment categories (maximum increase in diagnostic accuracy ΔAUC = + 0.05, p < 0.001) while also identifying combinations of features and models which reduced overall accuracy.  Conclusions:   The impact of radiomic features to differentiate PCa lesions according to their clinical significance remains controversial. It depends on feature selection and the employed machine learning algorithms. It can result in improvement or reduction of diagnostic performance.  Key points:   • Quantitative imaging features differ between normal and malignant tissue of the peripheral zone in prostate cancer. • Radiomic feature analysis of clinical routine multiparametric MRI has the potential to improve the stratification of clinically significant versus insignificant prostate cancer lesions in the peripheral zone. • Certain combinations of standard multiparametric MRI reporting and assessment categories with feature subsets and machine learning algorithms reduced the diagnostic performance over standard clinical assessment categories alone.""","""['Simon Bernatz', 'Jörg Ackermann', 'Philipp Mandel', 'Benjamin Kaltenbach', 'Yauheniya Zhdanovich', 'Patrick N Harter', 'Claudia Döring', 'Renate Hammerstingl', 'Boris Bodelle', 'Kevin Smith', 'Andreas Bucher', 'Moritz Albrecht', 'Nicolas Rosbach', 'Lajos Basten', 'Ibrahim Yel', 'Mike Wenzel', 'Katrin Bankov', 'Ina Koch', 'Felix K-H Chun', 'Jens Köllermann', 'Peter J Wild#', 'Thomas J Vogl#']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Multiparametric MRI and auto-fixed volume of interest-based radiomics signature for clinically significant peripheral zone prostate cancer.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging Radiomics-Based Machine Learning Prediction of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer in Equivocal PI-RADS 3 Lesions.', 'Clinico-radiological characteristic-based machine learning in reducing unnecessary prostate biopsies of PI-RADS 3 lesions with dual validation.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Artificial Intelligence in Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: Where Do We Stand in 2021?', 'Novel radiomic analysis on bi-parametric MRI for characterizing differences between MR non-visible and visible clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Value of handcrafted and deep radiomic features towards training robust machine learning classifiers for prediction of prostate cancer disease aggressiveness.', 'Imaging bridges pathology and radiology.', 'Evaluation of automatic discrimination between benign and malignant prostate tissue in the era of high precision digital pathology.', 'Detection of prostate cancer using diffusion-relaxation correlation spectrum imaging with support vector machine model - a feasibility study.']"""

We performed a detailed analysis of PDX methodology using a robust subcutaneous model and fresh tissues from patients with primary hormone naïve prostate cancer.  Methods:   Clinical prostate tumor specimens (n=26, Gleason score 6-10) were collected from robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomies at Turku University Hospital (Turku, Finland), cut into pieces, and implanted subcutaneously into 84 immunodeficient mice. Engraftments and the adjacent material from prostatic surgical specimens were compared using histology, immunohistochemistry and DNA sequencing.  Results:   The probability of a successful engraftment correlated with the presence of carcinoma in the implanted tissue. Tumor take rate was 41%. Surprisingly, mouse hormone supplementation inhibited tumor take rate, whereas the degree of mouse immunodeficiency did not have an effect. Histologically, the engrafted tumors closely mimicked their parental tumors, and the Gleason grades and copy number variants of the engraftments were similar to those of their primary tumors. Expression levels of androgen receptor, prostate-specific antigen, and keratins were retained in engraftments, and a detailed genomic analysis revealed high fidelity of the engraftments with their corresponding primary tumors. However, in the second or third passage of tumors, the carcinoma areas were almost completely replaced by benign tissue with frequent degenerative or metaplastic changes.

Objective:   To compare standard staging modalities with newer and potentially more accurate imaging modalities.  Design, setting, and participants:   This prospective, single-centre trial (NCT03537391) enrolled 80 patients with newly diagnosed high-risk PCa (International Society of Urological Pathology grade group ≥3 and/or prostate-specific antigen [PSA] ≥20 and/or cT ≥ T3; March 2018-June 2019) to undergo primary metastasis staging with two standard and three advanced imaging modalities.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The participants underwent the following five imaging examinations within 2 wk of enrolment and without a prespecified sequence: BS, CT, 99mTc-hydroxymethylene diphosphonate (99mTc-HMDP) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)-CT, 1.5 T whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WBMRI) using diffusion-weighted imaging, and 18F-prostate-specific membrane antigen-1007 (18F-PSMA-1007) positron emission tomography(PET)-CT. Each modality was reviewed by two independent experts blinded to the results of the prior studies, who classified lesions as benign, equivocal, or malignant. Pessimistic and optimistic analyses were performed to resolve each equivocal diagnosis. The reference standard diagnosis was defined using all available information accrued during at least 12 mo of clinical follow-up. Patients with equivocal reference standard diagnoses underwent MRI and/or CT to search for the development of anatomical correspondence. PSMA PET-avid lesions without histopathological verification were rated to be malignant only if there was a corresponding anatomical finding suspicious for malignancy at the primary or follow-up imaging.  Results and limitations:   Seventy-nine men underwent all imaging modalities except for one case of interrupted MRI. The median interval per patient between the first and the last imaging study was 8 d (interquartile range [IQR]: 6-9). The mean age was 70 yr (standard deviation: 7) and median PSA 12 ng/mL (IQR:7-23). The median follow-up was 435 d (IQR: 378-557). Metastatic disease was detected in 20 (25%) patients. The imaging modality 18F-PSMA-1007 PET-CT had superior sensitivity and highest inter-reader agreement. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) values for bone metastasis detection with PSMA PET-CT were 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85-0.95) and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.87-0.96) for readers 1 and 2, respectively, while the AUC values for BS, CT, SPECT-CT, and WBMRI were 0.71 (95% CI: 0.58-0.84) and 0.8 (95% CI: 0.67-0.92), 0.53 (95% CI: 0.39-0.67) and 0.66 (95% CI: 0.54-0.77), 0.77 (95% CI: 0.65-0.89) and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.62-0.88), and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.74-0.96) and 0.67 (95% CI: 0.54-0.80), respectively, for the other four pairs of readers. The imaging method 18F-PSMA-1007 PET-CT detected metastatic disease in 11/20 patients in whom standard imaging was negative and influenced clinical decision making in 14/79 (18%) patients. In 12/79 cases, false positive bone disease was reported only by PSMA PET-CT. Limitations included a nonrandomised study setting and few histopathologically validated suspicious lesions.  Conclusions:   Despite the risk of false positive bone lesions, 18F-PSMA-1007 PET-CT outperformed all other imaging methods studied for the detection of primary distant metastasis in high-risk PCa.  Patient summary:   In this report, we compared the diagnostic performance of conventional and advanced imaging. It was found that 18F-prostate-specific membrane antigen-1007 positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-PSMA-1007 PET-CT) was superior to the other imaging modalities studied for the detection of distant metastasis at the time of initial diagnosis of high-risk prostate cancer.

The Src pathway and neoangiogenesis have been implicated in prostate cancer progression. We studied the effect of adding the targeted agents dasatinib and sunitinib to abiraterone acetate (AA) in men with mCRPC.  Patients and methods:   In this open-label randomized phase 2 study, mCRPC patients received AA. At resistance to AA, they were randomized 1:1 to combination with dasatinib or sunitinib. At second progression, patients crossed over. The primary end point was time to treatment failure (TTF), defined as time to progression or death. Secondary end points included overall survival and safety.  Results:   From March 2011 to February 2015, a total of 179 patients were enrolled and 132 subsequently randomized.

Lack of awareness, knowledge and skills in screening for distress in this patient group are likely key barriers to psychosocial care provision. The objective therefore was to discuss the development, design and evaluation of the effectiveness of the Distress Screening for Prostate Cancer (DSPC) module in targeting the perceived challenges and barriers to distress screening and psychological care by healthcare professionals.  Data sources:   The DSPC module was piloted with five senior prostate cancer specialist nurses prior to the planned implementation with 50 prostate cancer nurses. Their average age was 49.8 years (range 43 to 57 years); there were three females and two males. Results from the Satisfaction with the Distress Screening Prostate Cancer E-Learning Module instrument indicated a high level of overall satisfaction with individual participants' scores ranging from 83-125/125 (mean 108.2).  Conclusion:   Distress screening is an essential component of prostate cancer care and based on the information collected from stakeholders an e-learning module was designed and developed as an interactive and engaging evidence-based, pedagogically sound educational platform. The preliminary results from piloting the e-learning module indicated a high level of learner satisfaction and a measurable improvement in pre-post knowledge acquisition scores. These results suggest that this approach has the potential to increase screening for distress in men with prostate cancer and lead to more timely referral to psychosocial and supportive care to improve men's quality of life after diagnosis and over the illness trajectory.  Implications for nursing practice:   Specialist nurses and other healthcare professionals play an important role in screening men with prostate cancer for distress. This newly designed educational resource supports nurses in their practice of screening men with prostate cancer and the appropriate referral process.""","""['Samantha Jakimowicz', 'Tracy Levett-Jones', 'Suzanne K Chambers']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Semin Oncol Nurs""","""['The effectiveness of internet-based e-learning on clinician behavior and patient outcomes: a systematic review protocol.', 'Nurse-Led Supportive Care Intervention for Men With Advanced Prostate Cancer.', ""Nurse-Led Supportive Care Intervention for Men With Advanced Prostate Cancer: Healthcare Professionals' Perspectives."", 'Psychosocial interventions for men with prostate cancer.', 'Psychosocial interventions for men with prostate cancer: a Cochrane systematic review.']"""

The functional role of rearranged ERG, however, is still incompletely understood. ERG rearrangements are maintained during prostate cancer progression suggesting that they may confer a selective advantage. The molecular basis of this notion is the subject of this study.  Methods:   A variety of immunological methods were used to characterize the effects of rearranged ERG on p53. Consequences of an overexpression of N-terminally deleted ERG on p53 function were interrogated by measuring apoptosis and cellular senescence in the presence or absence of exogenous DNA damage. Effects of N-terminally deleted ERG on the transactivation function of p53 were analyzed by qRT-PCR.  Results:   We show that overexpression of ERG leads to an increased basal level of DNA damage and a stabilization of p53 that involves a sequestration of its E3 ubiquitin ligase, MDM2, into nucleoli. A higher p53 expression was also observed in vivo in an ERG-overexpressing prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia mouse model. The correlation between ERG and p53 expression was corroborated in 163 patients with prostate cancer. ERG overexpression was found to inhibit both apoptosis and cellular senescence induced by exogenous DNA damage. Mechanistically, this protective effect of ERG involved an abrogation of the DNA damage-induced expression of p53 target genes.  Conclusions:   By protecting tumor cells from the antiproliferative consequences of genotoxic stress, ERG may allow the survival and proliferation of genomically unstable tumor cells. Targeting ERG may therefore represent a promising strategy to suppress such adverse features during prostate cancer progression.""","""['Adam Kaczorowski', 'Yanis Tolstov', 'Michael Falkenstein', 'Valeri Vasioukhin', 'Elena-Sophie Prigge', 'Christine Geisler', 'Maximilian Kippenberger', 'Cathleen Nientiedt', 'Leonie Ratz', 'Vladimir Kuryshev', 'Esther Herpel', 'Glen Kristiansen', 'Holger Sültmann', 'Albrecht Stenzinger', 'Magnus von Knebel Doeberitz', 'Markus Hohenfellner', 'Anette Duensing', 'Stefan Duensing']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['TMPRSS2-ERG Controls Luminal Epithelial Lineage and Antiandrogen Sensitivity in PTEN and TP53-Mutated Prostate Cancer.', 'SPOP and FOXA1 mutations are associated with PSA recurrence in ERG wt tumors, and SPOP downregulation with ERG-rearranged prostate cancer.', 'ERG rearrangement for predicting subsequent cancer diagnosis in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and lymph node metastasis.', 'Loss of FOXO1 Cooperates with TMPRSS2-ERG Overexpression to Promote Prostate Tumorigenesis and Cell Invasion.', 'A new twist in the feedback loop: stress-activated MDM2 destabilization is required for p53 activation.', 'Post-Translational Modifications That Drive Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Adiponectin paradox as a therapeutic target of the cancer evolvability in aging.']"""

However, few models are specific to the population served or easily implemented in a clinical setting. We sought to create life expectancy estimates specific to Veterans diagnosed with prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Using national Veterans Health Administration electronic health records, we identified Veterans diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2000 and 2015. We abstracted demographics, comorbidities, oncologic staging, and treatment information. We fit Cox Proportional Hazards models to determine the impact of age, comorbidity, cancer risk, and race on survival. We stratified life expectancy estimates by age, comorbidity and cancer stage.  Results:   Our analytic cohort included 145,678 patients. Survival modeling demonstrated the importance of age and comorbidity across all cancer risk categories. Life expectancy estimates generated from age and comorbidity data were predictive of overall survival (C-index 0.676, 95% CI 0.674-0.679) and visualized using Kaplan-Meier plots and heatmaps stratified by age and comorbidity. Separate life expectancy estimates were generated for patients with localized or advanced disease. These life expectancy estimates calibrate well across prostate cancer risk categories.

Analyses were adjusted on age and gender when appropriate, using a multivariate, hierarchical, linear mixed-effects model.  Results:   Among 20,613 consultations recorded, 580 involved cancer screening (2.8%) and 475 cancer follow-ups (2.3%). The most frequent cancer screening procedures concerned colorectal cancer (38.6% of screening procedures), breast cancer (32.6%), cervical cancer (17.0%), and prostate cancer (9.3%). In consultations with female patients, the most frequent types of cancer followed up were breast (44.9%) and colorectal cancer (10.5%), and with male patients, the most frequent were prostate (37.3%) and skin cancer (10.3%). After adjustment on age and gender, consultations with cancer follow-up included a mean 1.9 health problems managed in addition to cancer.

Materials and Methods: We performed a monocentric single-operator study on 187 consecutive RALP. Patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 (standard anastomosis, until December 2017) and Group 2 (subsphincteric anastomosis [SSA], since January 2018). The SSA consisted in respecting the sphincteric sleeve during the anastomosis suturing only the internal layer of the urethra with the bladder and thereby avoiding the loss of sphincteric length induced by the suture. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative data were prospectively collected and compared. Criteria of continence were as follows: no pad use and complete absence of leakage at catheter removal at 1 month and 1 year. Results: The two groups were comparable in terms of prostate-specific antigen, gland volume, and Gleason score. In Group 2 (SSA), we observed a complete continence recovery in 75.6% at catheter removal (p = 0.0000035), in 82.9% at 1 month (p = 0.000092), and in 97.5% at 1 year (p = 0.028), independently of bladder neck preservation (p = 0.388). There was also a significant difference between the two groups concerning urinary reeducation requirement (p = 0.0006), pad use, and urinary quality of life (p = 0.0000002). No anastomosis complication was reported. Conclusions: The SSA significantly improved the rates of immediate, early, and 1-year continence recovery after RALP.

Therefore, we performed a secondary data analysis based on existing data from the public Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (2003-2010) database.  Methods and study design:   Totally 6403 participants were selected from NHANES (2003-2010) database. The interested independent and dependent variables were considered as dietary phosphorus intake and PSA level, respectively. Covariates included demographic data, dietary data, physical examination data, and comorbidities. Weighted linear regression and generalized additive models were used to addressing the linear and non-linear link of phosphorus intake to PSA level.  Results:   Linear association between phosphorus intake and PSA was not detected [β=0.016 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) -0.012, 0.045)]. But we found an existing nonlinearity. By the recursive algorithm, the inflection point was 1151 mg. On the left side of the inflection point, we did not find the correlation between dietary phosphorus intake (per 100 change) and PSA level [β=-0.04 (95% CI -0.11, 0.02), p=0.2155], while dietary phosphorus intake (per 100 change) positively associated with PSA [β=0.05 (95% CI 0.01, 0.09) p=0.0293] on the right side of inflection point.  Conclusions:   There is a non-linear correlation between dietary phosphorus intake and PSA.

The objective of this study was to validate the discriminatory power of these subregions with respect to the whole organs in a large independent population.  Methods and materials:   The validation cohort consisted of 450 patients from the TROG03.04-RADAR trial treated with 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy at 66 to 74 Gy. Previous voxel-based analyses identified an inferoanterior rectal subregion as predictive of rectal bleeding and 5 subregions in the urethra and the posterior and superior part of the bladder as predictive of urinary incontinence, dysuria, retention, and hematuria. In the validation cohort, these subregions were segmented in each patient's anatomy. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) of the whole organs and the 6 subregions were compared bin-wise between patients with and without toxicities. The discriminatory power of DVHs for grade ≥2 toxicity endpoints was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).  Results:   Subregion DVHs were significantly different between patients with and without toxicities for late rectal bleeding (V44-V74), acute urinary incontinence (V68-V72), late dysuria (V56-V68), and late retention (V14-V64). The dose to the rectal subregion and the whole rectum were equally predictive of rectal bleeding (V68; AUC = 0.61). The doses to 3 out of the 5 urethro-vesical subregions were found to be more predictive than the dose to the whole bladder: in the urethra for acute incontinence (V71 AUC = 0.69 vs V71 AUC = 0.66), in the posterior part of the bladder for late dysuria (V65 AUC = 0.66 vs V68 AUC = 0.59), and late retention (V39 AUC = 0.74 vs no significant AUC).  Conclusions:   Three subregions located in the urethra and the bladder were successfully validated as more predictive of urinary toxicity than the whole bladder for urinary incontinence, retention, and dysuria.

However, its prognostic relevance is controversial. In this study, we evaluated the impact of both PNI status (PNI+ versus PNI-) and quantified number of PNI focus on the long-term prognosis of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after RP. After reevaluating PNI of a total of 721 patients with localized PCa who underwent RP at our institution between 2000 and 2002, we examined associations between PNI status or PNI focus number and clinicopathological factors including tumor stage, Gleason score, margin status, tumor location, preoperative prostate specific antigen, age, prostate weight as well as BCR outcome. PNI was present in 530 of 721 cases (73.5%) of the RP specimens and was associated with more aggressive disease. BCR occurred in 19.4% of all patients within a median follow-up period of 8.5 years. PNI+ status was associated with poor BCR prognosis in univariate analysis but lost in multivariate analysis. Based on the number of PNI focus, PNI was further divided into 2 distinct group: PNI+ a (≤3) and PNI+ b (>3). In a multivariate Cox regression model, PNI+ b (>3) was identified as an independent BCR prognostic factor. Quantification of PNI focus number beside the dichotomized status recording will not only provide more detailed information but also be a novel prognostic indicator for risk stratification. Further external validation will be needed for an optimal cut-off value of the PNI focus number.

HRQOL improved from baseline with nivolumab but remained the same or deteriorated with everolimus.  Conclusions:   The superior efficacy of nivolumab over everolimus is maintained after extended follow-up with no new safety signals, and this supports the long-term benefits of nivolumab monotherapy in patients with previously treated aRCC.  Lay summary:   CheckMate 025 compared the effects of nivolumab (a novel immunotherapy) with those of everolimus (an older standard-of-care therapy) for the treatment of advanced kidney cancer in patients who had progressed on antiangiogenic therapy. After 5 years of study, nivolumab continues to be better than everolimus in extending the lives of patients, providing a long-lasting response to treatment, and improving quality of life with a manageable safety profile. The results demonstrate that the clinical benefits of nivolumab versus everolimus in previously treated patients with advanced kidney cancer continue in the long term.""","""['Robert J Motzer', 'Bernard Escudier', 'Saby George', 'Hans J Hammers', 'Sandhya Srinivas', 'Scott S Tykodi', 'Jeffrey A Sosman', 'Elizabeth R Plimack', 'Giuseppe Procopio', 'David F McDermott', 'Daniel Castellano', 'Toni K Choueiri', 'Frede Donskov', 'Howard Gurney', 'Stéphane Oudard', 'Martin Richardet', 'Katriina Peltola', 'Ajjai S Alva', 'Michael Carducci', 'John Wagstaff', 'Christine Chevreau', 'Satoshi Fukasawa', 'Yoshihiko Tomita', 'Thomas C Gauler', 'Christian K Kollmannsberger', 'Fabio A Schutz', 'James Larkin', 'David Cella', 'M Brent McHenry', 'Shruti Shally Saggi', 'Nizar M Tannir']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Safety and efficacy of nivolumab in combination with sunitinib or pazopanib in advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma: the CheckMate 016 study.', 'CheckMate 025 Randomized Phase 3 Study: Outcomes by Key Baseline Factors and Prior Therapy for Nivolumab Versus Everolimus in Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma.', 'Survival outcomes and independent response assessment with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus sunitinib in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma: 42-month follow-up of a randomized phase 3 clinical trial.', 'Axitinib, cabozantinib, everolimus, nivolumab, sunitinib and best supportive care in previously treated renal cell carcinoma: a systematic review and economic evaluation.', 'Cabozantinib for Renal Cell Carcinoma: Current and Future Paradigms.', 'SEOM SOGUG clinical guideline for treatment of kidney cancer (2022).', 'Fulminant Liver Failure after Treatment with a Checkpoint Inhibitor for Gastric Cancer: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.', 'Cancer Drugs Reimbursed with Limited Evidence on Overall Survival and Quality of Life: Do Follow-Up Studies Confirm Patient Benefits?', 'DUX4 is a common driver of immune evasion and immunotherapy failure in metastatic cancers.', 'A network approach to define the predictive role of immune profile on tumor response and toxicity of anti PD-1 single agent immunotherapy in patients with solid tumors.']"""

We describe a novel application of SHAP values to the prediction of mortality risk in prostate cancer.  Methods:   Patients with nonmetastatic, node-negative prostate cancer, diagnosed between 2004 and 2015, were identified using the National Cancer Database. Model features were specified a priori: age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Gleason score, percent positive cores (PPC), comorbidity score, and clinical T stage. We trained a gradient-boosted tree model and applied SHAP values to model predictions. Open-source libraries in Python 3.7 were used for all analyses.  Results:   We identified 372,808 patients meeting the inclusion criteria. When analyzing the interaction between PSA and Gleason score, we demonstrated consistency with the literature using the example of low-PSA, high-Gleason prostate cancer, recently identified as a unique entity with a poor prognosis. When analyzing the PPC-Gleason score interaction, we identified a novel finding of stronger interaction effects in patients with Gleason ≥ 8 disease compared with Gleason 6-7 disease, particularly with PPC ≥ 50%. Subsequent confirmatory linear analyses supported this finding: 5-year overall survival in Gleason ≥ 8 patients was 87.7% with PPC < 50% versus 77.2% with PPC ≥ 50% (P < .001), compared with 89.1% versus 86.0% in Gleason 7 patients (P < .001), with a significant interaction term between PPC ≥ 50% and Gleason ≥ 8 (P < .001).  Conclusion:   We describe a novel application of SHAP values for modeling and visualizing nonlinear interaction effects in prostate cancer. This ML-based approach is a promising technique with the potential to meaningfully improve risk stratification and staging systems.""","""['Richard Li', 'Ashwin Shinde', 'An Liu', 'Scott Glaser', 'Yung Lyou', 'Bertram Yuh', 'Jeffrey Wong', 'Arya Amini']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""JCO Clin Cancer Inform""","""['Percentage of positive biopsy cores: a better risk stratification model for prostate cancer?', 'Percent positive biopsy cores as a prognostic factor for prostate cancer treated with external beam radiation.', 'Men presenting with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values of over 100\xa0ng/mL.', 'Short-term androgen suppression and radiotherapy versus intermediate-term androgen suppression and radiotherapy, with or without zoledronic acid, in men with locally advanced prostate cancer (TROG 03.04 RADAR): an open-label, randomised, phase 3 factorial trial.', 'Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'Development and Validation of a Machine Learning Model to Identify Patients Before Surgery at High Risk for Postoperative Adverse Events.', 'A machine learning evaluation of patient characteristics associated with prescribing of guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure.', 'Performance of Machine Learning Algorithms for Predicting Disease Activity in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.', 'Risk factors for unplanned reoperation after corrective surgery for adult spinal deformity.', 'XML-GBM lung: An explainable machine learning-based application for the diagnosis of lung cancer.']"""

The aim of this study is to investigate the role of PAX3 in PCa. PAX3 expression was compared between PCa tumor tissue and nontumor tissues and PCa cell lines and normal prostate epithelial cells (PNT2) by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry staining. MTT and immunofluorescence assays were used to detect PCa cell proliferation. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate cell apoptosis in PCa. Transwell assays were used for the determination of cell migration and PCa cell invasion. PAX3 expression was higher in PCa tissues and human PCa cell lines. Moreover, PAX3 silencing inhibited the proliferation, metastasis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of PCa cells, and increased the rates of apoptosis. PAX3 silencing inhibited transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/Smad signaling in PCa cells. The effects of si-PAX3 on the proliferation, apoptosis, metastasis, and EMT of PCa cells were alleviated by TGF-β1 treatment. PAX3 silencing inhibits PCa progression through the inhibition of TGF-β/Smad signaling.

Aims:   We conducted a feasibility study to determine the practicality of delivering PROACTIVE at two prostate cancer centres.  Methods and results:   The feasibility study was a mixed-methods randomized parallel-group exploratory trial. Participants were randomised using a ratio of 3:1 PROACTIVE group to treatment as usual. Qualitative semi-structured interviews and quantitative measures were completed at baseline, intervention completion (week 6), and at 6-month follow-up. Interview transcripts were analysed thematically using Framework analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to examine recruitment and retention rates and changing trends in outcome measures. Most aspects of the research design and PROACTIVE intervention were acceptable to those participating in the study. In particular, participants valued the opportunity to share and discuss experiences with other prostate cancer patients on Active Surveillance and receive detailed authoritative information. However, three issues were identified: (a) a low response rate (13 participants recruited, response rate 16%), (b) low utilisation of internet delivered information modules, (c) self-perceived low levels of anxiety amongst participants with the majority perceiving their cancer as not impacting on their day-to-day life or causing anxiety.

Computed tomography data of five biopsy-proven HRPC patients were selected for this study. Two different planning target volumes (PTV1 and PTV2 ) were contoured for each patient. The PTV1 included the prostate, seminal vesicles, and pelvic lymphatics, while the PTV2 included only the prostate and seminal vesicles. The prescribed dose was 54 Gy for the PTV1 with a sequential boost (24 Gy for the PTV2 ). Intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) techniques were used to generate treatment plans with 6 and 10 MV photon energies with the flattening filter (FF) or flattening filter-free (FFF) irradiation mode. The excess absolute risks (EARs) were calculated and compared for the bladder, rectum, pelvic bone, and soft tissue based on the linear-exponential, plateau, full mechanistic, and specific mechanistic sarcoma dose-response model. According to the models, all treatment plans resulted in similar risks of secondary bladder or rectal cancer and pelvic bone or soft tissue sarcoma except for the estimated risk of the bladder according to the full mechanistic model using IMRT(6MV;FF) technique compared with VMAT techniques with FFF options. The overall estimation of EAR indicated that the radiation-induced cancer risk due to RT in HRPC was lower for bladder than the rectum. EAR values ranged from 1.47 to 5.82 for bladder and 6.36 to 7.94 for rectum, depending on the dose-response models used. The absolute risks of the secondary pelvic bone and soft tissue sarcoma were small for the plans examined. We theoretically predicted the radiation-induced secondary cancer risk in HRPC patients with pelvic irradiation. Nevertheless, prospective clinical trials, with larger patient cohorts with a long-term follow-up, are needed to validate these model predictions.""","""['Emel Haciislamoglu', 'Gorkem Gungor', 'Gokhan Aydin', 'Emine Canyilmaz', 'Ozan Cem Guler', 'Ahmet Yasar Zengin', 'Kamil Mehmet Yenice']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Radiation-induced second primary cancer risks from modern external beam radiotherapy for early prostate cancer: impact of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and flattening filter free (FFF) radiotherapy.', 'Comparison of VMAT-SABR treatment plans with flattening filter (FF) and flattening filter-free (FFF) beam for localized prostate cancer.', 'Second Cancer Risk after simultaneous integrated boost radiation therapy of right sided breast cancer with and without flattening filter.', 'Second primary cancers after radiation for prostate cancer: a review of data from planning studies.', 'The Impact of Pelvic Nodal Radiotherapy on Hematologic Toxicity: A Systematic Review with Focus on Leukopenia, Lymphopenia and Future Perspectives in Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Estimation of the risk of secondary cancer in rectum and bladder after radiation therapy for prostate cancer using a feasibility dose-volume histogram.', 'Recommendations for reducing exposure to medical X-ray irradiation (Review).', 'Assessment of Radiation-Induced Bladder and Bowel Cancer Risks after Conventionally and Hypo-Fractionated Radiotherapy for the Preoperative Management of Rectal Carcinoma.', 'Risk factors and specific cancer types of second primary malignancies in patients with breast cancer receiving adjuvant radiotherapy: a case-control cohort study based on the SEER database.', 'A Rare Primary Osteogenic Sarcoma of the Prostate and Bladder.']"""

Materials and methods:   A multicenter cohort of patients who underwent PSMA PET/CT and pelvic mpMRI prior to RP with pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) was analyzed. Increased Ga68-PSMA uptake on PET/CT and enlarged (> 10 mm) or abnormal lymph nodes on mpMRI were considered positive findings. The final surgical pathology served as the standard of reference. The negative predictive value (NPV) was calculated for each modality separately, as well as the combined value.  Results:   Included were 89 patients with D'Amico intermediate (45%) or high-risk (55%) prostate cancer. The median number of extracted LN was 9 (IQR 6-14). LNI was found in 12 (13.5%) patients.

The clinical examination of cancer proteins or biomarkers is extremely significant in early examination and monitoring of recurrence of disease after treatment. Biomarkers have expanded great clinical significance owing to their extensive spectra in the identification, elimination, early diagnosis and cure of cancer. In this work, novel, ultrasensitive sandwich-type portable bio device based on citrate-capped silver nanoparticles (Citrate-AgNPs) modified graphene quantum dots (GQDs) nano ink for detection of Prostate specific antigen (PSA) was fabricated. Functionalized cysteamine with gold nanoparticles (Cys-AuNPs) was also utilized to amplify the signal. It provides a good and high external area for the immobilization biotinylated antibody of PSA in the large amount. For the first time, citrate-AgNPs-GQDs nano ink was directly written on the cellulose paper surface (ivory sheet and photographic paper) and modified by Cys-AuNPs. So, final structure of the immunodevices was completed after including of Ab1 and PSA (antigen). The immunosensors were used for the recognition of PSA by using DPVs (differential pulse voltammetry) technique. The obtained low limit of quantification (LLOQ) of the first immunodevice (ivory sheet/Citrate AgNPs-GQDs nano-ink/CysA-Au NPs/Ab1/BSA/PSA/Ab2) was 0.07 μg/L and the linear range for the calibration plot was from 0.07 to 60 μg/L.

Herein, we investigated the effect of ethanol extract of Withania somnifera root (WRE) standardized for one of its components (withaferin A) on fatty acid synthesis using LNCaP and 22Rv1 human prostate cancer cells. Withania somnifera is a medicinal plant used in the Ayurvedic medicine practiced in India. Western blotting and confocal microscopy revealed a statistically significant decrease in protein levels of key fatty acid metabolism enzymes including ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) in WRE-treated cells compared with solvent control. The mRNA levels of ACLY, ACC1, FASN, and CPT1A were also lower in WRE-treated cells in comparison with control. Consequently, WRE treatment resulted in a significant decrease in intracellular levels of acetyl-CoA, total free fatty acids, and neutral lipid droplets in both LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. WRE exhibited greater potency for fatty acid synthesis inhibition at equimolar concentration than cerulenin and etomoxir. Exposure to WRE results in downregulation of c-Myc and p-Akt(S473) proteins in 22Rv1 cell line. However, overexpression of only c-Myc conferred protection against clonogenic cell survival and lipogenesis inhibition by WRE. In conclusion, these results indicate that WRE is a novel inhibitor of fatty acid synthesis in human prostate cancer cells.""","""['Su-Hyeong Kim', 'Krishna B Singh', 'Eun-Ryeong Hahm', 'Balakrishna L Lokeshwar', 'Shivendra V Singh']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Tradit Complement Med""","""['RNA-seq reveals novel mechanistic targets of withaferin A in prostate cancer cells.', 'Prostate cancer chemoprevention by sulforaphane in a preclinical mouse model is associated with inhibition of fatty acid metabolism.', 'Withaferin A Inhibits Fatty Acid Synthesis in Rat Mammary Tumors.', 'Key Molecules of Fatty Acid Metabolism in Gastric Cancer.', 'Pharmacological inhibitors of Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN)--catalyzed endogenous fatty acid biogenesis: a new family of anti-cancer agents?', 'In silico analysis and molecular docking studies of natural compounds of Withania somnifera against bovine NLRP9.', 'Withaferin A inhibits breast cancer-induced osteoclast differentiation.', 'Withania somnifera: Progress towards a Pharmaceutical Agent for Immunomodulation and Cancer Therapeutics.', 'Critical review of the Withania somnifera (L.)

In an exploratory analysis, initial ptDNA change was found to associate with the duration of response to prior androgen deprivation therapy (p < 0.0001) but not to prior taxanes (p = 0.32).  Conclusions:   We found that ptDNA assessment for therapy monitoring in mCRPC is feasible and provides data relevant to the clinical setting.

Methods:   The cost-effectiveness of active monitoring, surgery, and radiotherapy was evaluated within the Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) randomised controlled trial from a UK NHS perspective at 10 years' median follow-up. Prostate cancer resource-use collected from hospital records and trial participants was valued using UK reference-costs. QALYs (quality-adjusted-life-years) were calculated from patient-reported EQ-5D-3L measurements. Adjusted mean costs, QALYs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated; cost-effectiveness acceptability curves and sensitivity analyses addressed uncertainty; subgroup analyses considered age and disease-risk.  Results:   Adjusted mean QALYs were similar between groups: 6.89 (active monitoring), 7.09 (radiotherapy), and 6.91 (surgery). Active monitoring had lower adjusted mean costs (£5913) than radiotherapy (£7361) and surgery (£7519). Radiotherapy was the most likely (58% probability) cost-effective option at the UK NICE willingness-to-pay threshold (£20,000 per QALY). Subgroup analyses confirmed radiotherapy was cost-effective for older men and intermediate/high-risk disease groups; active monitoring was more likely to be the cost-effective option for younger men and low-risk groups.

Mechanistically, coupling cell cycle with metabolism is largely achieved by timely destruction of IDH1/2, key TCA cycle enzymes, in a Skp2-dependent manner. As such, depleting SKP2 abolishes cell cycle-dependent fluctuation of IDH1 protein abundance, leading to reduced glycolysis in S phase. Furthermore, elevated Skp2 abundance in prostate cancer cells destabilizes IDH1 to favor glycolysis and subsequent tumorigenesis.

AUY922 (luminespib), a new-generation HSP90 inhibitor, exhibits potent preclinical efficacy against several cancer types including prostate cancer. However, clinical use of HSP90 inhibitors for prostate cancer has been limited by toxicity and treatment resistance. Here, we aimed to design an effective combinatorial therapeutic regimen that utilizes subtoxic doses of AUY922, by identifying potential survival pathways induced by AUY922 in clinical prostate tumors. We conducted a proteomic analysis of 30 patient-derived explants (PDE) cultured in the absence and presence of AUY922, using quantitative mass spectrometry. AUY922 significantly increased the abundance of proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid metabolism in the PDEs. Consistent with these findings, AUY922-treated prostate cancer cell lines exhibited increased mitochondrial mass and activated fatty acid metabolism processes. We hypothesized that activation of fatty acid oxidation is a potential adaptive response to AUY922 treatment and that cotargeting this process will sensitize prostate cancer cells to HSP90 inhibition. Combination treatment of AUY922 with a clinical inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation, perhexiline, synergistically decreased viability of several prostate cancer cell lines, and had significant efficacy in PDEs. The novel drug combination treatment induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis, and attenuated the heat shock response, a known mediator of HSP90 treatment resistance. This combination warrants further preclinical and clinical investigation as a novel strategy to overcome resistance to HSP90 inhibition.

Human platelets contribute to metastasis via tumor cell-induced platelet aggregation, which in part enhances cancer cell invasion. Given the more aggressive nature of hormone insensitive prostate cancer, we hypothesized that androgen receptor-negative prostate cancer cells exhibit higher platelet aggregation potency and invasive response compared to cells with androgen receptor.  Objective:   To characterize the role of androgen receptors in prostate cancer-induced platelet aggregation and platelet-induced invasion.  Methods:   Tumor cell-induced platelet aggregation experiments were performed with platelets from healthy human donors and benign prostate (RWPE-1) and prostate cancer cell lines positive (LNCaP) and negative for androgen receptor (DU145 and PC3). Immunoblot measured prostate cancer prothrombin. Modified Boyden chamber invasion assays and zymography were performed to assess the effects of platelets on prostate cancer cell invasion and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression, respectively.  Results:   Androgen receptor-positive prostate cancer cell lines failed to induce platelet aggregation. However, androgen receptor-inhibited and -negative cell lines all induced platelet aggregation, which was abolished by dabigatran. Androgen receptor-inhibited and -negative cell lines demonstrated greater expression of prothrombin than androgen receptor-positive cells. Platelets enhanced invasion and MMP-2 and -9 expression by androgen receptor-inhibited and negative prostate cancer cells, but not that of the androgen receptor-positive cells.

We have shown that nuclear factor I/B (NFIB) regulates AR activity in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells in vitro. However, the status of NFIB in prostate cancer was unknown.  Methods:   We immunostained a tissue microarray including normal, hyperplastic, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, primary prostatic adenocarcinoma, and castration-resistant prostate cancer tissue samples for NFIB, AR, and synaptophysin, a marker of neuroendocrine differentiation. We interrogated publically available data sets in cBioPortal to correlate NFIB expression and AR and neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPCa) activity scores. We analyzed prostate cancer cell lines for NFIB expression via Western blot analysis and used nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation to assess where NFIB is localized. We performed co-immunoprecipitation studies to determine if NFIB and AR interact.  Results:   NFIB increased in the nucleus and cytoplasm of prostate cancer samples versus matched normal controls, independent of Gleason score. Similarly, cytoplasmic AR and synaptophysin increased in primary prostate cancer. We observed strong NFIB staining in primary small cell prostate cancer. The ratio of cytoplasmic-to-nuclear NFIB staining was predictive of earlier biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer, once adjusted for tumor margin status. Cytoplasmic AR was an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence. There was no statistically significant difference between NFIB and synaptophysin expression in primary and castration-resistant prostate cancer, but cytoplasmic AR expression was increased in castration-resistant samples. In primary prostate cancer, nuclear NFIB expression correlated with cytoplasmic NFIB and nuclear AR, while cytoplasmic NFIB correlated with synaptophysin, and nuclear and cytoplasmic AR. In castration-resistant prostate cancer samples, NFIB expression correlated positively with an AR activity score, and negatively with the NEPCa score. In prostate cancer cell lines, NFIB exists in several isoforms. We observed NFIB predominantly in the nuclear fraction of prostate cancer cells with increased cytoplasmic expression seen in castration-resistant cell lines. We observed an interaction between AR and NFIB through co-immunoprecipitation experiments.  Conclusion:   We have described the expression pattern of NFIB in primary and castration-resistant prostate cancer and its positive correlation with AR.

Although the etiology is not well understood, chronic prostatic inflammation is thought to play an important role in BPH initiation and progression. Our recent studies suggest that the prostatic epithelial barrier is compromised in glandular BPH tissues. The proinflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) impacts tight junction formation, enhances epithelial barrier permeability, and suppresses claudin-1 messenger RNA expression in prostatic epithelial cells. However, the role of claudin-1 in the prostatic epithelial barrier and its regulation by TGF-β1 in prostatic epithelial cells are not clear.  Methods:   The expression of claudin-1 was analyzed in 22 clinical BPH specimens by immunohistochemistry. Human benign prostate epithelial cell lines BPH-1 and BHPrE1 were treated with TGF-β1 and transfected with small interfering RNAs specific to claudin-1. Epithelial monolayer permeability changes in the treated cells were measured using trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER). The expression of claudin-1, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, snail, slug, and activation of mitogen-activated proteins kinases (MAPKs) and AKT was assessed following TGF-β1 treatment using Western blot analysis.  Results:   Claudin-1 expression was decreased in glandular BPH tissue compared with adjacent normal prostatic tissue in patient specimens. TGF-β1 treatment or claudin-1 knockdown in prostatic epithelial cell lines increased monolayer permeability. TGF-β1 decreased levels of claudin-1 and increased levels of snail and slug as well as increased phosphorylation of the MAPK extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK-1/2) in both BPH-1 and BHPrE1 cells. Overexpression of snail or slug had no effect on claudin-1 expression. In contrast, PD98059 and U0126, inhibitors of the upstream activator of ERK-1/2 (ie, MEK-1/2) restored claudin-1 expression level as well as the epithelial barrier.  Conclusion:   Our findings suggest that downregulation of claudin-1 by TGF-β1 acting through the noncanonical MEK-1/2/ERK-1/2 pathway triggers increased prostatic epithelial monolayer permeability in vitro. These findings also suggest that elevated TGF-β1 may contribute to claudin-1 downregulation and compromised epithelial barrier in clinical BPH specimens.""","""['Ke Wang', 'Laura E Pascal', 'Feng Li', 'Wei Chen', 'Rajiv Dhir', 'Goundappa K Balasubramani', 'Donald B DeFranco', 'Naoki Yoshimura', 'Dalin He', 'Zhou Wang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Transforming growth factor beta 1 impairs benign prostatic luminal epithelial cell monolayer barrier function.', 'E-cadherin is downregulated in benign prostatic hyperplasia and required for tight junction formation and permeability barrier in the prostatic epithelial cell monolayer.', 'Protein kinase Cα inhibitor protects against downregulation of claudin-1 during epithelial-mesenchymal transition of pancreatic cancer.', 'Growth factors in benign prostatic hyperplasia: basic science implications.', 'Immune Cell Proinflammatory Microenvironment and Androgen-Related Metabolic Regulation During Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia in Aging.', 'Atypical Macropinocytosis Contributes to Malignant Progression: A Review of Recent Evidence in Endometrioid Endometrial Cancer Cells.', 'RNA sequencing and integrative analysis reveal pathways and hub genes associated with TGFβ1 stimulation on prostatic stromal cells.', 'A Comprehensive Analysis of Metabolomics and Transcriptomics Reveals Novel Biomarkers and Mechanistic Insights on Lorlatinib Crosses the Blood-Brain Barrier.', 'Increased integrity of cell-cell junctions accompanied by increased expression of claudin 4 in keratinocytes stimulated with vitamin D3.', 'E-cadherin expression is inversely correlated with aging and inflammation in the prostate.']"""

A total 89 OM-PC patients, who were identified between 2013 and 2019, were included in the present study. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis were used to separately assess the prostate specific antigen (PSA) progression-free survival (PFS). Overall accuracy was determined by analyzing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The analysis of patients in these three different groups indicated that patients with lower NRI values were significantly associated with a higher Gleason score and more neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (P < 0.05). In addition, the Kaplan-Meier curve analysis revealed that OM-PC patients in the preoperative high-risk group had shorter PSA-PFS (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the multivariate analysis further predicted that the high-risk NRI value is a common independent prognostic factor for shorter PSA-PFS (P < 0.001). Moreover, it was also observed that the AUC value of the NRI score was higher than other conventional nutritional indicators.

Developing a robust and automatic method to detect the CTV on intraoperative TRUS images is clinically important to have faster and reproducible interventions that can benefit both the clinical workflow and patient health.  Methods:   We present a multi-task deep learning method for an automatic prostate CTV boundary detection in intraoperative TRUS images by leveraging both the low-level and high-level (prior shape) information. Our method includes a channel-wise feature calibration strategy for low-level feature extraction and learning-based prior knowledge modeling for prostate CTV shape reconstruction. It employs CTV shape reconstruction from automatically sampled boundary surface coordinates (pseudo-landmarks) to detect the low-contrast and noisy regions across the prostate boundary, while being less biased from shadowing, inherent speckles, and artifact signals from the needle and implanted radioactive seeds.  Results:   The proposed method was evaluated on a clinical database of 145 patients who underwent permanent prostate brachytherapy under TRUS guidance. Our method achieved a mean accuracy of [Formula: see text] and a mean surface distance error of [Formula: see text]. Extensive ablation and comparison studies show that our method outperformed previous deep learning-based methods by more than 7% for the Dice similarity coefficient and 6.9 mm reduced 3D Hausdorff distance error.  Conclusion:   Our study demonstrates the potential of shape model-based deep learning methods for an efficient and accurate CTV segmentation in an ultrasound-guided intervention. Moreover, learning both low-level features and prior shape knowledge with channel-wise feature calibration can significantly improve the performance of deep learning methods in medical image segmentation.""","""['Kibrom Berihu Girum', 'Alain Lalande', 'Raabid Hussain', 'Gilles Créhange']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg""","""['Automatic prostate segmentation using deep learning on clinically diverse 3D transrectal ultrasound images.', 'Fast interactive medical image segmentation with weakly supervised deep learning method.', 'Accurate and robust deep learning-based segmentation of the prostate clinical target volume in ultrasound images.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Prostate volume measurement by transrectal ultrasound and computed tomography before and after permanent prostate brachytherapy.', 'A Robust and Explainable Structure-Based Algorithm for Detecting the Organ Boundary From Ultrasound Multi-Datasets.', 'Ultrasound Prostate Segmentation Using Adaptive Selection Principal Curve and Smooth Mathematical Model.', 'A Web-Based Automated Image Processing Research Platform for Cochlear Implantation-Related Studies.', 'A review of artificial intelligence in prostate cancer detection on imaging.', 'Domain generalization for prostate segmentation in transrectal ultrasound images: A multi-center study.']"""

Yet there are important gaps in our understanding of the relevant transcriptional networks driving this process. Progression from localized to metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) occurs as a result of accumulated resistance mechanisms that develop upon sustained androgen receptor (AR) suppression. Critical to this progression is the plastic nature by which prostate tumor cells transition from epithelial to mesenchymal states (EMT).  Methods:   Here, using prostate cancer cell lines with different AR composition, we systematically manipulated somatic proteins of the Bromodomain and ExtraTerminal (BET) family (BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4) to determine which BET proteins influence EMT. We used the TCGA repository to correlate the expression of individual BET genes with key EMT genes and determined biochemical recurrence in 414 patients and progression free survival in 488 patients.  Results:   We found that only BRD4-and not BRD2 or BRD3-regulates the expression of SNAI1 and SNAI2, and that the downregulation of these EMT transcription factors significantly increases E-cadherin expression. Furthermore, of the BET genes, only BRD4 correlates with survival outcomes in prostate cancer patients. Moreover, selective degradation of BRD4 protein with MZ1 ablates EMT (transcriptionally and morphologically) induced by TGFß signaling.  Conclusions:   Many relapsed/refractory tumors share a neuroendocrine transcriptional signature that had been relatively rare until highly successful antiandrogen drugs like abiraterone and enzalutamide came into widespread use. New therapeutic targets must therefore be developed. Our results identify key EMT genes regulated by BRD4, and offers a novel druggable target to treat mCRPC. BRD4-selective protein degraders offer a promising next generation approach to treat the emerging forms of chemoresistance in advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Jordan S Shafran', 'Naser Jafari', 'Allison N Casey', 'Balázs Győrffy', 'Gerald V Denis']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['BRD4 Regulates Metastatic Potential of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer through AHNAK.', 'Targeting the BRD4-HOXB13 Coregulated Transcriptional Networks with Bromodomain-Kinase Inhibitors to Suppress Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal (BET) Family Proteins in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC).', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Signaling and Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: Emerging Biomarkers and Opportunities for Precision Therapeutics.', 'Novel forms of prostate cancer chemoresistance to successful androgen deprivation therapy demand new approaches: Rationale for targeting BET proteins.', 'Epigenetic regulation of hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal cell states in cancer.', 'BET Bromodomain Inhibitors: Novel Design Strategies and Therapeutic Applications.', 'Role of transcription factors and chromatin modifiers in driving lineage reprogramming in treatment-induced neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Novel plasma exosome biomarkers for prostate cancer progression in co-morbid metabolic disease.', 'Consistent DNA Hypomethylations in Prostate Cancer.']"""

This study investigates the role of ROBO1-pathway in predicting outcome and race-based disparity in patients with CaP.  Methods and results:   Aided by RNA sequencing-based DECIPHER-testing and immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of tumors we show that ROBO1 is lost during the progressive stages of CaP, a prevalent feature in African-Americans. We show that the loss of ROBO1 predicts high-risk of recurrence, metastasis and poor outcome of androgen-deprivation therapy in radical prostatectomy-treated patients. These data identified an aggressive ROBO1deficient /DOCK1+ve sub-class of CaP. Combined genetic and IHC data showed that ROBO1 loss is accompanied by DOCK1/Rac1 elevation in grade-III/IV primary-tumors and Mets. We observed that the hypermethylation of ROBO1-promoter contributes to loss of expression that is highly prevalent in African-Americans. Because of limitations in restoring ROBO1 function, we asked if targeting the DOCK1 could be an ideal strategy to inhibit progression or treat ROBO1deficient metastatic-CaP. We tested the pharmacological efficacy of CPYPP, a selective inhibitor of DOCK1 under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Using ROBO1-ve and ROBO1+ve CaP models, we determined the median effective concentration of CPYPP for growth. DOCK1-inhibitor treatment significantly decreased the (a) Rac1-GTP/β-catenin activity, (b) transmigration of ROBO1deficient cells across endothelial lining, and (c) metastatic spread of ROBO1deficient cells through the vasculature of transgenicfl Zebrafish model.

Collagen is a main component of reactive stroma and changes systematically and quantitatively to reflect the course of PCa, yet has remained undefined due to a lack of tools that can define collagen protein structure. Here we use a novel collagen-targeting proteomics approach to investigate zonal regulation of collagen-type proteins in PCa prostatectomies.  Methods:   Prostatectomies from nine patients were divided into zones containing 0%, 5%, 20%, 70% to 80% glandular tissue and 0%, 5%, 25%, 70% by mass of PCa tumor following the McNeal model. Tissue sections from zones were graded by a pathologist for Gleason score, percent tumor present, percent prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and/or inflammation (INF). High-resolution accurate mass collagen targeting proteomics was done on a select subset of tissue sections from patient-matched tumor or nontumor zones. Imaging mass spectrometry was used to investigate collagen-type regulation corresponding to pathologist-defined regions.  Results:   Complex collagen proteomes were detected from all zones. COL17A and COL27A increased in zones of INF compared with zones with tumor present. COL3A1, COL4A5, and COL8A2 consistently increased in zones with tumor content, independent of tumor size. Collagen hydroxylation of proline (HYP) was altered in tumor zones compared with zones with INF and no tumor. COL3A1 and COL5A1 showed significant changes in HYP peptide ratios within tumor compared with zones of INF (2.59 ± 0.29, P value: .015; 3.75 ± 0.96 P value .036, respectively). By imaging mass spectrometry COL3A1 showed defined localization and regulation to tumor pathology. COL1A1 and COL1A2 showed gradient regulation corresponding to PCa pathology across zones. Pathologist-defined tumor regions showed significant increases in COL1A1 HYP modifications compared with COL1A2 HYP modifications. Certain COL1A1 and COL1A2 peptides could discriminate between pathologist-defined tumor and inflammatory regions.

Gleason score 8 is a heterogeneous disease including Gleason score 3 + 5, 4 + 4, and 5 + 3 tumors, and encompasses a broad range of tumor growth patterns. Our objective was to characterize individual growth patterns and identify prognostic parameters in Gleason score 8 prostate cancer patients. We reviewed 1064 radical prostatectomy specimens, recorded individual Gleason 4 and 5 growth patterns as well as presence of intraductal carcinoma, and evaluated biochemical recurrence- and metastasis-free survival. Gleason score 8 disease was identified in 140 (13%) patients, of whom 76 (54%) had Gleason score 3 + 5, 46 (33%) 4 + 4, and 18 (13%) 5 + 3 disease. Invasive cribriform and/or intraductal carcinoma (n = 87, 62%) was observed more frequently in Gleason score 4 + 4 (93%) than 3 + 5 (47%; P < 0.001) and 5 + 3 (44%; P < 0.001) patients. Gleason pattern 5 was present in 110 (79%) men: as single cells and/or cords in 99 (90%) and solid fields in 32 (29%) cases. Solid field pattern 5 coexisted with cribriform architecture (23/32, 72%) more frequently than nonsolid pattern 5 cases (36/78, 46%, P = 0.02). In multivariable analysis including age, prostate-specific antigen, pT-stage, surgical margin status, and lymph node metastases, presence of cribriform architecture was an independent parameter for biochemical recurrence-free (hazard ratio (HR) 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-3.7; P = 0.04) and metastasis-free (HR 3.5, 95% CI 1.0-12.3; P = 0.05) survival. In conclusion, invasive cribriform and/or intraductal carcinoma occurs more frequently in Gleason score 4 + 4 prostate cancer patients than in Gleason score 3 + 5 and 5 + 3, and is an independent parameter for biochemical recurrence and metastasis.

However, the correlation of PSMA expression and overall survival (OS) in patients treated with Lu-PSMA therapy is currently unclear; especially with regard to coexistence of high and low PSMA expressing metastases. To this end, this retrospective single arm study elucidates the correlation of PSMA expression and overall survival in patients treated with Lu-PSMA therapy. Additionally, PET based criteria to define low PSMA expression were explored. Methods: Eighty-five patients referred to Lu-PSMA therapy were included in the analysis. Pretherapeutic 68Ga-PSMA-PET-CT scans were available for all patients. SUVmax of the highest PSMA expressing metastasis (PSMAmax), SUVmax of the lowest PSMA expressing metastasis (PSMAmin), and average SUVmax of all metastases (PSMAaverage) amongst other PET parameters were measured for each patient. A log-rank cutoff-finder was used to determine low (lowPSMAaverage) and high (highPSMAaverage) average PSMA expression as well as low (lowPSMAmin) and high (highPSMAmin) minimal PSMA expression. Results: PSMAaverage was a significant prognosticator of overall survival in contrast to PSMAmax (HR: 0.959; p = 0.047 vs. HR: 0.992; p = 0.231). Optimal log rank cut-offs were: PSMAaverage = 14.3; PSMAmin = 10.2. Patients with low average PSMA expression (lowPSMAaverage) had significantly shorter survival compared to those with high average expression (highPSMAaverage) (5.3 vs. 15.1 months; p < 0.001; HR: 3.738, 95%CI = 1.953-7.154; p < 0.001). Patients with low PSMA expressing metastases (lowPSMAmin) had shorter survival compared to those without a low PSMA expressing metastasis (highPSMAmin) (p = 0.003; 7.9 months vs. 21.3; HR: 4.303, 95%CI = 1.521-12.178; p = 0.006). Patients that were classified as highPSMAaverage but with lowPSMAmin had an intermediate overall survival (11.4 months; longer compared to lowPSMAaverage, 5.3 months, p = 0.002; but shorter compared to highPSMAmin, 21.3 months, p = 0.02). Conclusion: Low average PSMA expression is a negative prognosticator of overall survival. Absence of low PSMA expressing metastases is associated with best overall survival and the maximum PSMA expression seems not suited to prognosticate overall survival. Low PSMA expression might therefore be a negative prognosticator for the outcome of patients treated with Lu-PSMA therapy.

Thus, there is an unmet need for identifying predictive parametres prior or under PSMA-RLT treatment. We therefore aimed to correlate several clinical and molecular parameters with response to PSMA treatment in a cohort of mCRPC patients undergoing PSMA RLT followed by a detailed analysis of promising candidates. Methods: Nineteen patients, median age 68.8 years (range: 56.9 - 83.3) with mCRPC were included in this study. We performed baseline analysis of clinical parameters based on PSMA PET/CT, (metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total tumor volume (TTV)), serum PSA, ALP, LDH and gene expression analysis of circulating tumor cells (expression of AR full length (AR-FL), AR splice variant 7 (AR-V7), PSA and PSMA) as well as common markers for neuroendocrine differentiation (NED). Results: Patients presented with bone, lymph node, and visceral metastases (89%, 68%, and 21%, respectively). All patients were pretreated with docetaxel, either abiraterone or enzalutamide, or both. Biochemical response in terms of PSA decline ≥50 or ≥30% was observed in 42% and 63%, respectively. There were significant correlations between PSA and PSMA mRNA expression, as well as tumor volumes (both MTV and TTV), AR-FL and AR-V7 mRNA expression. However, there was no correlation with response to PSMA treatment. Furthermore, none of these parameters was significantly correlated with baseline serum PSA values. Common NED markers were shown to be specifically high expressed and revealed impact on OS independent from AR-V7 gene expression. Conclusion: We demonstrate that AR-FL and its splice variant AR-V7 might serve as prognostic biomarkers displaying high tumor burden in mCRPC patient prior to PSMA-RLT. Contrary, PSMA, which has been discussed as a biomarker for PSMA targeted treatment, does not display strong prognostic ability - at least on the mRNA level. Surprisingly, none of these parameters correlates to response to PSMA treatment. In contrast, commom NED markers such as SYP and ENO2 as well as FOXA1 expression level seem to predict OS, but not PFS, more reliably. We admit that a limitation of our study is the focus on mRNA expression of potential biomarkers only. Further investigations analyzing the potential role of protein expression of these markers are therefore warranted.""","""['Katharina Kessel', 'Robert Seifert', 'Matthias Weckesser', 'Wolfgang Roll', 'Verena Humberg', 'Katrin Schlack', 'Martin Bögemann', 'Christof Bernemann', 'Kambiz Rahbar']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['PSMA targeted radioligandtherapy in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer after chemotherapy, abiraterone and/or enzalutamide.

Methods:   Within the National Inpatient Sample database (2008-2015), we identified obese (body mass index ≥30 kg/m2) vs. non-obese patients with non-metastatic bladder cancer treated with RARC or ORC. Estimated annual percent changes and weighted multivariable logistic and linear regression models adjusted for clustering as well as age, comorbidities, hospital volume, and respectively surgical approach, lengths of stay, and/or complications were used.  Results:   Of all 11,594 patients (unweighted patient count), 1,119 (9.7%) were obese vs. 10,475 (90.3%) were not-obese.

Case:   In this article we present a case of a patient with initially metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, associated with double heterozygous germline mutation in BRCA2 and CHEK2 genes, with the description of clinical, radiological and histomorphological characteristics of the disease as well as the dia-gnostic and therapeutic procedure.  Results:   The patient with initially metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma with multiple liver involvement achieved complete remission following first-line FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy. The treatment lasted for 12 months but due to increased neurotoxicity since the 9th cycle, oxaliplatin was excluded from the regimen. Given the family history of several malignancies (prostate cancer, seminoma), genetic testing was performed, which confirmed heterozygous germline mutations in BRCA2 and CHEK2 genes. Since the treatment has been completed, the patient remains in complete remission at 30 months.

Methods:   408 patients with ISUP grade group 1 prostate cancer, undergone to radical prostatectomy and T measurement were included.

Results:   Statistically significant differences resulted between serum testosterone values and ISUP grade groups (P < 0.0001). Significant correlation was found analyzing testosterone values versus age (P < 0.0001), and versus PSA (P = 0.008). BCR-free survival was significantly decreased in patients with low levels of testosterone (P = 0.005). These findings were confirmed also in the ISUP 1-2 subgroups (P = 0.01).

Methods:   UK Biobank is a prospective population-based cohort study. 364,899 adults (51.6 % females, mean age 56.0 years) were included. The exposure variable was physical activity level derived from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF). Participants were categorised at 'high' (≥1,500 MET-minutes/week), 'moderate' (≥600 MET-minutes/week) or 'low' levels of activity following standardised IPAQ-SF scoring guidance. Primary outcome measures included incident cancers at 20 sites. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) showing relationships between physical activity and cancer.  Results:   21,816 incident cancers were identified.

As long as using template-grid, the angle of cryoprobe placement is limited in 1 direction through grid-hole. Accordingly, the neurovascular bundles are injured by the ice-ball formation outside of the prostate. The free-hands technique allows the ice-ball to cover the entire cancer and preserve neurovascular bundles because of the ideal ice-ball formation within prostate and along with the prostate contour.  Material and methods:   Primary localized prostate cancer which has typically single focus of Gleason 7 cancer is targeted, which is MRI-visible targeted-biopsy proven clinically significant cancer. The procedure is performed with real-time transrectal ultrasound-guided free-hands technique. Three cryoprobes are used, including the main probe to target the center of the image-visible lesion, and other 2 probes to cover the safety margins. The entry of the probe into the prostate is achieved in the apex level and then the angle of the insertion is changed laterally to hit the center of the cancer. The ice-ball formation is aiming lethal temperature to cover the entire cancer lesion, with minimizing of the thermal injury in the functional anatomies such as neurovascular bundles and sphincter.  Results:   The most technically challenging procedure is to treat the caner lesion in contact with prostate posterior margin. Ice-ball extension needs to extend over 5 mm extraprostate toward the rectal wall, in order to achieve the lethal temperature in contact with posterior prostate capsule. The cryo-prove would be fixed in the prostate tissues completely by freezing-effect. By the lift-up manipulation of the probe anteriorly, we can easily lift the prostate upward, resulting in making of the Denonviellie space wider.

The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate treatment planning factors associated with urinary toxicity, particularly damage to the membranous urethra (MUL) and external urethral sphincter (EUS), after MARS.  Material and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 227 patients treated with MARS. Comparisons were made between several factors including preimplantation length of the MUL and EUS dosimetric characteristics after implantation with longitudinal changes in American Urological Association (AUA) urinary symptom score.  Results:   Rates of grade 3 urinary incontinence and obstructive urinary symptoms were 4% and 2%. A piecewise mixed univariate model revealed that MUL and V200, V150, V125, and D5 to the EUS were all associated with increased rates of urinary toxicity over time. On univariate logistic regression, MUL >14.2 mm (odds ratio [OR] 2.03 per cm3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-3.77, p = 0.025), V125 to the EUS (OR 3.21 cm3, 95% CI 1.18-8.71, p = 0.022), and use of the I-125 isotope (OR 3.45, 95% CI 1.55-7.70, p = 0.001) were associated with subacute urinary toxicity (i.e., that occurring at 4-8 months). Optimal dose-constraint limits to the EUS were determined to be V200 < 0.04 cm3 (p = 0.002), V150 < 0.12 cm3 (p = 0.041), V125 < 0.45 cm3 (p = 0.033), D30 < 160 Gy (p = 0.004), and D5 < 218 Gy (p = 0.016).

Methods and materials:   13 patients underwent TRUS and multiview two-dimensional fluoroscopic imaging partway through the implant, as well as repeat fluoroscopic imaging with the TRUS probe inserted and retracted, and finally three-dimensional CBCT imaging at the end of the implant. The locations of all the implanted seeds were obtained from the fluoroscopy/CBCT images and were registered to prostate contours delineated on the TRUS images based on a common subset of seeds identified on both image sets. Prostate contours were also deformed, using a finite-element model, to take into account the effect of the TRUS probe pressure. Prostate dosimetry parameters were obtained for fluoroscopic and CBCT-dosimetry approaches and compared with the standard-of-care Day-0 postimplant CT dosimetry.  Results:   High linear correlation (R2 > 0.8) was observed in the measured values of prostate D90%, V100%, and V150%, between the two intraoperative dosimetry approaches. The prostate D90% and V100% obtained from intraoperative dosimetry methods were in agreement with the postimplant CT dosimetry. Only the prostate V150% was on average 4.1% (p-value <0.05) higher in the CBCT-dosimetry approach and 6.7% (p-value <0.05) higher in postimplant CT dosimetry compared with the fluoroscopic dosimetry approach.

Methods and materials:   Records of patients receiving radical external beam RT (EBRT) for localised prostate cancer with a full or empty bladder were reviewed. These included the bladder size on planning CT, daily online image guided RT (IGRT) setup data, treatment time and post treatment follow up data.These included bPFS, gastrointestinal(GI) and genitourinary(GU) toxicity scoring post RT using the CTCAE v4.0 scoring system. All patients included in the study were planned and treated under the same departmental clinical protocol with VMAT and daily online IGRT corrections.  Results:   90 patients were treated with 60 Gy in 20 fractions with a median follow up of 48 months. At 4 years bPFS in the empty bladder group was 100 and 98% in the full bladder group (p = 0.27). There were no statistically significant differences in cumulative ≥Grade 2GU (p = 0.10) and GI (p = 0.27) toxicity rates between the two bladder filling protocols. No statistically significant differences in the IGRT setup between the two groups of patients. Although the median treatment times per fraction were not statistically different between the two groups (p = 0.47), patients in the full bladder filling group were required to spend a longer time in the RT department per treatment session for bladder filling.  Conclusion:   An empty bladder filling protocol has non-inferior bPFS, GI and GU toxicities at 4 years in patients with localised prostate cancer using advanced RT techniques in comparison to a full bladder filling protocol. A longer follow up with a larger sample size is required to validate this approach.

SRARP is located on chromosome 1p36.13 and is widely inactivated by deletions and epigenetic silencing in malignancies. Therefore, additional studies are required to explore SRARP as a potential cancer biomarker.  Aim:   This study explores the application of SRARP as a novel biomarker in malignancies of multiple tissue origins using the analysis of large genomic datasets.  Methods and results:   A comprehensive genomic analysis of large cancer datasets was carried out to examine the association of SRARP expression and copy-number with molecular and clinical features in malignancies of multiple tissue origins. This study demonstrated that SRARP under-expression and copy-number loss are strongly associated with the loss of other tumor suppressors such as TP53 and NF1 mutations and oncogenic gains, including N-MYC amplification and ERG rearrangement, suggesting that SRARP inactivation is associated with wider genomic instability in malignancies. Importantly, SRARP under-expression and copy-number loss are strong predictors of poor clinical and/or pathological features in breast, colorectal, lung, prostate, gastric, endometrial, cervical, brain, ovarian, bladder, thyroid, and hepatocellular cancers as well as neuroblastoma, uveal melanoma, and acute myeloid leukemia with highly significant odds ratios. Finally, higher SRARP expression and copy-number predict a better response to several cancer drugs.

To date, there have been no analyses or classifications of apps for patients with genitourinary cancers, which are among the most prevalent types of cancer.  Objective:   The objective of our study was to analyze the quality of apps for patients diagnosed with genitourinary cancers using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) and identify high-quality apps.  Methods:   We performed an observational cross-sectional descriptive study of all smartphone apps for patients diagnosed with genitourinary cancers available on iOS and Android platforms. In July 2019, we searched for all available apps for patients with genitourinary cancers (bladder, prostate, cervical, uterine, endometrial, kidney, testicular, and vulvar) or their caregivers. Apps were downloaded and evaluated, and the general characteristics were entered into a database. The evaluation was performed by 2 independent researchers using the MARS questionnaire, which rates 23 evaluation criteria clustered in 5 domains (Engagement, Functionality, Esthetics, Information, and Subjective Quality) on a scale from 1 to 5.  Results:   In total, 46 apps were analyzed. Of these, 31 (67%) were available on Android, 6 (13%) on iOS, and 9 (20%) on both platforms. The apps were free in 89% of cases (41/46), and 61% (28/46) had been updated in the previous year. The apps were intended for prostate cancer in 30% of cases (14/46) and cervical cancer in 17% (8/46). The apps were mainly informative (63%, 29/46), preventive (24%, 11/46), and diagnostic (13%, 6/46). Only 7/46 apps (15%) were developed by health care organizations. The mean MARS score for the overall quality of the 46 apps was 2.98 (SD 0.77), with a maximum of 4.63 and a minimum of 1.95. Functionality scores were quite similar for most of the apps, with the greatest differences in Engagement and Esthetics, which showed acceptable scores in one-third of the apps. The 5 apps with the highest MARS score were the following: ""Bladder cancer manager,"" ""Kidney cancer manager,"" ""My prostate cancer manager,"" ""Target Ovarian Cancer Symptoms Diary,"" and ""My Cancer Coach."" We observed statistically significant differences in the MARS score between the operating systems and the developer types (P<.001 and P=.01, respectively), but not for cost (P=.62).  Conclusions:   MARS is a helpful methodology to decide which apps can be prescribed to patients and to identify which features should be addressed to improve these tools. Most of the apps designed for patients with genitourinary cancers only try to provide data about the disease, without coherent interactivity. The participation of health professionals in the development of these apps is low; nevertheless, we observed that both the participation of health professionals and regular updates were correlated with quality.""","""['Miguel Ángel Amor-García', 'Roberto Collado-Borrell', 'Vicente Escudero-Vilaplana', 'Alejandra Melgarejo-Ortuño', 'Ana Herranz-Alonso', 'José Ángel Arranz Arija', 'María Sanjurjo-Sáez']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""JMIR Mhealth Uhealth""","""['Smartphone Apps for Patients With Hematologic Malignancies: Systematic Review and Evaluation of Content.', 'Mobile Apps for Hematological Conditions: Review and Content Analysis Using the Mobile App Rating Scale.', 'Mobile Phone Apps for Food Allergies or Intolerances in App Stores: Systematic Search and Quality Assessment Using the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS).', 'Mobile Apps for Drug-Drug Interaction Checks in Chinese App Stores: Systematic Review and Content Analysis.', 'Mobile Applications (Apps) to Support the Hepatitis C Treatment: A Systematic Search in App Stores.', 'A smartphone-based self-care application for patients with urinary tract stones: identification of information content and functional capabilities.', 'Smartphone Apps for Patients With Hematologic Malignancies: Systematic Review and Evaluation of Content.', 'Do pain management apps use evidence-based psychological components?

We hypothesized that chemohormonal therapy (CHT) with androgen-deprivation therapy plus docetaxel before RP would improve biochemical progression-free survival (BPFS) over RP alone.  Patients and methods:   Men with clinically localized, high-risk PC were assigned to RP alone or neoadjuvant CHT with androgen deprivation plus docetaxel (75 mg/m2 body surface area every 3 weeks for 6 cycles) and RP. The primary end point was 3-year BPFS. Biochemical failure was defined as a serum prostate-specific antigen level > 0.2 ng/mL that increased on 2 consecutive occasions that were at least 3 months apart. Secondary end points included 5-year BPFS, overall BPFS, local recurrence, metastasis-free survival (MFS), PC-specific mortality, and overall survival (OS).  Results:   In total, 788 men were randomly assigned. Median follow-up time was 6.1 years. The overall rates of grade 3 and 4 adverse events during chemotherapy were 26% and 19%, respectively. No difference was seen in 3-year BPFS between neoadjuvant CHT plus RP and RP alone (0.89 v 0.84, respectively; 95% CI for the difference, -0.01 to 0.11; P = .11). Neoadjuvant CHT was associated with improved overall BPFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.99), improved MFS (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.95), and improved OS (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.94) compared with RP alone.  Conclusion:   The primary study end point, 3-year BPFS, was not met. Although some improvement was seen in secondary end points, any potential benefit must be weighed against toxicity.

After column chromatographic purification, all the synthesized complexes were fully characterized using different spectroscopic and analytical techniques including mass spectroscopy, 1H NMR, FT-IR and UV-vis spectrophotometry. The Ru-NO stretching frequency of [4](PF6)3 was observed at 1941 cm-1, which suggests moderately strong Ru-NO bonding. A massive shift in the νNO frequency occurred at Δν = 329 cm-1 (solid) upon reducing [4](PF6)3 to [4](PF6)2. To understand the molecular integrity of the complexes, the structure of [3](PF6) was successfully determined by X-ray crystallography. The redox properties of [4](PF6)3 were thoroughly investigated together with the other precursor complexes. The rate constants for the first-order photo-release of NO from [4](PF6)3 and [4](PF6)2 were determined to be 8.01 × 10-3 min-1 (t1/2 ∼ 86 min) and 3.27 × 10-2 min-1 (t1/2 ∼ 21 min), respectively, when exposed to a 200 W Xenon light. Additionally, the photo-cleavage of Ru-NO occurred within ∼2 h when [4](PF6)3 was irradiated with an IR light source (>700 nm) at room temperature. The first-order rate constant of 9.4 × 10-3 min-1 (t1/2 ∼ 73 min) shows the efficacy of the system and its capability to release NO in the photo-therapeutic window. The released NO triggered by light was trapped by reduced myoglobin, a biologically relevant target protein. The one-electron reduction of [4](PF6)3 to [4](PF6)2 was systematically carried out chemically (hydrazine hydrate), electrochemically and biologically. In the biological reduction, it was found that the reduction is much slower with double-stranded DNA compared to a single-stranded oligonucleotide (CAAGGCCAACCGCGAGAAGATGAC).

However, cost constraints have made it difficult for many institutions to implement the newer methods. We evaluated the performance of a low-cost cognitive-targeting biopsy protocol based on 1.5 T multiparametric MRI graded with Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2 to examine the role for these institutions moving forward.  Methods:   Retrospective analysis of 251 consecutive patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) under 50 who underwent MRI and subsequent prostate biopsy at a single facility. In addition to systematic biopsy, targeted cores were obtained with cognitive recognition under ultrasound. A control group of 267 consecutive patients with PSA under 50 biopsied without prior MRI was analyzed.  Results:   Prostate biopsy preceded by MRI had a significantly higher probability of detecting both prostate cancer (68.1% vs. 51.3%) and clinically significant prostate cancer (57.4% vs. 39.7%) (p values < 0.01). Combination of systematic and targeted biopsy outperformed either regimen alone. PSA density and PI-RADS score were identified as independent risk factors, and a proposed diagnostic model (PSA density ≥ 0.25 or PI-RADS score ≥ 4) showed sensitivity of 88.6%, specificity of 55%, PPV of 81.2%, NPV of 68.8%, and accuracy of 78.0%.  Conclusions:   Both pre-biopsy MRI and cognitive-targeted biopsy contributed to improvement of cancer yield. Future alterations of possible benefit included increasing target cores per lesion, and combining PI-RADS score and PSA density as indicators for biopsy.

Furthermore, the expression of BCYRN1 was found to be associated with Gleason score and lymph node metastasis. It was demonstrated that BCYRN1 silencing using small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibited the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. The results of the present study indicated the presence of a reciprocal regulatory association between BCYRN1 and microRNA (miR)‑939‑3p. In addition, it was observed that BCYRN1 directly sponged miR‑939‑3p to upregulate histone deacetylase 11 (HDAC11) expression in prostate cancer cells. Moreover, transfection of recombinant HDAC11 reversed the inhibition of cell proliferation that was induced by BCYRN1 siRNA. A positive correlation between BCYRN1 and HDAC11 mRNA expression levels was also identified in prostate tumor and healthy tissues.

We found that EA downregulated the gene and protein expression levels of MDM2 and increased the protein expression of p53 as determined by qPCR and western blot analyses. Moreover, by using western blot analysis, we determined that EA increased the protein expression of the p53 target proteins p21, p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) [also known as Bcl‑2‑binding component 3 (BBC3)] and Phorbol‑12‑myristate‑13‑acetate‑induced protein 1 (NOXA).

The molecular biology of PCa cancer in this group of patients remains unclear. Here, we applied weighted gene coexpression network analysis of the expression of miRNAs from 24 EO-PCa patients (38-45 years) and 25 late-onset PCa patients (LO-PCa, 71-74 years) to identify key miRNAs in EO-PCa patients. In total, 69 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified. Specifically, 26 and 14 miRNAs were exclusively deregulated in young and elderly patients, respectively, and 29 miRNAs were shared. We identified 20 hub miRNAs for the network built for EO-PCa. Six of these hub miRNAs exhibited prognostic significance in relapse-free or overall survival. Additionally, two of the hub miRNAs were coexpressed with mRNAs of genes previously identified as deregulated in EO-PCa and in the most aggressive forms of PCa in African-American patients compared with Caucasian patients. These genes are involved in activation of immune response pathways, increased rates of metastasis and poor prognosis in PCa patients. In conclusion, our analysis identified miRNAs that are potentially important in the molecular pathology of EO-PCa.

Given that inactivation of FOXO1 has been reported in many types of human cancer, we sought to investigate whether restoration of the pro-apoptotic activity of FOXO1 may be used as a new promising strategy for cancer treatment. Our previous study revealed that Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), a serine/threonine kinase that is essential for cell cycle progression, is a novel and major regulator of FOXO1 in the late phases of the cell cycle. Here, we provided evidence that PLK1-dependent phosphorylation of FOXO1 induces its nuclear exclusion and negatively regulates FOXO1's transcriptional activity in prostate cancer (PCa). Blocking the PLK1-dependant phosphorylation of FOXO1 restored the pro-apoptotic function of FOXO1 in PCa. Combining PLK1 inhibition with nocodazole (to induce mitotic arrest) had synergistic antitumor effects in vitro, with minimal effect on normal prostate epithelial cells.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is expressed in prostate epithelium and upregulated on the surface of prostatic adenocarcinoma cells. Studies have shown PSMA enzymatic activity is involved in malignancy-driven neoangiogenesis in the endothelium of tumor-associated neovasculature in breast, lung, thyroid, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and urothelial cancer. Recently, PSMA-targeted imaging technology (PSMA PET-CT) detected the presence of PSMA in primary cholangiocarcinoma. However histological correlation with PSMA expression other mass lesions in the liver has not yet been studied.  Methods:   72 cases of liver mass resection were collected at a tertiary hospital from 2011 to 2019. Immunohistochemical stains for PSMA and CD34 were performed. The expression of PSMA in tumor cells and associated neovascular endothelium were analyzed separately and the locations of vascular structures were confirmed by CD34 expression.  Results:   Among 72 cases, 28 cases (22/72, 38.9%) showed PSMA peritumoral/vascular expression only, 3 cases (3/72, 4.2%) showed tumor cell expression only, and 2 cases (2/72, 2.8%) showed both tumor cell and peritumoral/vascular expression. The remainder (39/72, 54.2%) showed no expression. Particularly, most of primary cholangiocarcinoma showed PSMA vascular expression (13/15, 86.7%), while none of the 18 cases of metastatic pancreatobiliary adenocarcinoma were positive for PSMA (0/18, 0%) (p < 0.01). Outside of pancreatobiliary adenocarcinoma, none of the metastatic tumors, including colon and lung cancers, expressed PSMA. In 8 cases of metastatic prostate carcinoma, 3 showed PSMA expressions in tumor cells only (3/8, 37.5%) and 2 expressed PMSA in both tumor cells and neovasculature (2/8, 25.0%). Out of 22 HCC cases, 15 (15/22, 68.2%) were positive for PSMA in tumor vasculature. None of the 5 hepatic adenoma expressed PSMA (0/5, 0%).  Conclusion:   Significantly enhanced tumor-associated neovascular PSMA expression was identified in primary cholangiocarcinoma, compared to metastatic pancreatobiliary adenocarcinoma.

The molecular mechanisms underlying enzyme catalysis and inhibition remained elusive for SRD5α2 and other eukaryotic integral membrane steroid reductases due to a lack of structural information.

Structural analysis together with computational and mutagenesis studies reveals molecular mechanisms for the 5α-reduction of testosterone and the finasteride inhibition involving residues E57 and Y91. Molecular dynamics simulation results indicate high conformational dynamics of the cytosolic region regulating the NADPH/NADP + exchange.

Alcohol consumption has been inconsistently associated with cancer risk in observational studies. This mendelian randomisation (MR) study sought to investigate associations in support of a causal relationship between smoking and alcohol consumption and 19 site-specific cancers.  Methods and findings:   We used summary-level data for genetic variants associated with smoking initiation (ever smoked regularly) and alcohol consumption, and the corresponding associations with lung, breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer from genome-wide association studies consortia, including participants of European ancestry. We additionally estimated genetic associations with 19 site-specific cancers among 367,643 individuals of European descent in UK Biobank who were 37 to 73 years of age when recruited from 2006 to 2010. Associations were considered statistically significant at a Bonferroni corrected p-value below 0.0013. Genetic predisposition to smoking initiation was associated with statistically significant higher odds of lung cancer in the International Lung Cancer Consortium (odds ratio [OR] 1.80; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.59-2.03; p = 2.26 × 10-21) and UK Biobank (OR 2.26; 95% CI 1.92-2.65; p = 1.17 × 10-22). Additionally, genetic predisposition to smoking was associated with statistically significant higher odds of cancer of the oesophagus (OR 1.83; 95% CI 1.34-2.49; p = 1.31 × 10-4), cervix (OR 1.55; 95% CI 1.27-1.88; p = 1.24 × 10-5), and bladder (OR 1.40; 95% CI 1.92-2.65; p = 9.40 × 10-5) and with statistically nonsignificant higher odds of head and neck (OR 1.40; 95% CI 1.13-1.74; p = 0.002) and stomach cancer (OR 1.46; 95% CI 1.05-2.03; p = 0.024). In contrast, there was an inverse association between genetic predisposition to smoking and prostate cancer in the Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome consortium (OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.83-0.98; p = 0.011) and in UK Biobank (OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.80-1.02; p = 0.104), but the associations did not reach statistical significance. We found no statistically significant association between genetically predicted alcohol consumption and overall cancer (n = 75,037 cases; OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.84-1.07; p = 0.376). Genetically predicted alcohol consumption was statistically significantly associated with lung cancer in the International Lung Cancer Consortium (OR 1.94; 95% CI 1.41-2.68; p = 4.68 × 10-5) but not in UK Biobank (OR 1.12; 95% CI 0.65-1.93; p = 0.686). There was no statistically significant association between alcohol consumption and any other site-specific cancer. The main limitation of this study is that precision was low in some analyses, particularly for analyses of alcohol consumption and site-specific cancers.  Conclusions:   Our findings support the well-established relationship between smoking and lung cancer and suggest that smoking may also be a risk factor for cancer of the head and neck, oesophagus, stomach, cervix, and bladder.

However, the mechanism of prostate cancer proluminal differentiation is largely unknown. Through integrating analysis of the transcription factors (TFs) from 806 human prostate cancers, we found that ERG was highly correlated with prostate cancer luminal subtyping. ERG overexpression in luminal epithelial cells inhibited those cells' normal plasticity to transdifferentiate into a basal lineage, and ERG superseded PTEN loss, which favored basal differentiation. ERG KO disrupted prostate cell luminal differentiation, whereas AR KO had no such effects. Trp63 is a known master regulator of the prostate basal lineage. Through analysis of 3D chromatin architecture, we found that ERG bound and inhibited the enhancer activity and chromatin looping of a Trp63 distal enhancer, thereby silencing its gene expression. Specific deletion of the distal ERG binding site resulted in the loss of ERG-mediated inhibition of basal differentiation.

Patients and methods:   Two independent clinical cohorts of patients, treated with androgen signalling inhibitors (ASIs: abiraterone and enzalutamide) or docetaxel as a first-line treatment for mCRPC, were used in this study: a derivation cohort (196 patients with mCRPC) and an external validation cohort (211 patients with mCRPC).  Results:   Three independent predictors for OS, including duration of initial androgen deprivation therapy <12 months before mCRPC diagnosis, alkaline phosphatase level >350 U/dL and haemoglobin level <11 g/dL at the diagnosis of mCRPC, were defined as risk factors. Patients with zero, one and multiple risk factors were assigned to a favourable-, intermediate- and poor-risk group, respectively. The median OS values in each risk group were well separated in the derivation cohort (P < 0.001) as well as in the validation cohort (P < 0.001). Of a total of 407 patients with mCRPC, 84 were assigned to the poor-risk group with the median OS of 12 months.

Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters are designed to prevent PE, but defining the appropriate use of IVC filters in patients with cancer remains a substantial unmet clinical need.  Objective:   To evaluate the association of IVC filters with the development of PE in patients with cancer and deep venous thrombosis (DVT).  Design, setting, and participants:   A population-based cohort study was conducted using administrative data on 88 585 patients from the state inpatient databases for California (2005-2011) and Florida (2005-2014). Based on diagnostic and procedure codes, patients with cancer and acute lower extremity DVT were identified. All subsequent hospital visits for these patients were evaluated for the placement of an IVC filter, the development of new PE, the development of new DVT, and in-hospital mortality. Data analysis was performed from September 1 to December 1, 2019.  Exposures:   Placement of an IVC filter.  Main outcomes and measures:   The association of IVC filter placement with rates of new PE and DVT was estimated using a propensity score matching algorithm and competing risk analysis.  Results:   The study cohort comprised 88 585 patients (45 074 male; median age, 71.0 years [range, 1.0-104.0 years]) with malignant neoplasms who presented to a health care institution with a diagnosis of acute lower extremity DVT. Of these patients, 33 740 (38.1%) underwent IVC filter placement; patients with risk factors such as upper gastrointestinal bleeding (odds ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.29-1.37), intracranial hemorrhage (odds ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.19-1.24), and coagulopathy (odds ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.08-1.10) were more likely to receive an IVC filter. A total of 4492 patients (5.1%) developed a new PE after their initial DVT diagnosis. There was a significant improvement in PE-free survival for these patients compared with those who did not receive IVC filters across the full, unbalanced study cohort as well as after propensity score matching and competing risk analysis (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.64-0.75; P < .001). Furthermore, IVC filter placement reduced the development of PE in patients with very high-risk malignant neoplasms (eg, pancreaticobiliary cancer), high-risk malignant neoplasms (eg, lung cancer), and low-risk malignant neoplasms (eg, prostate cancer). After accounting for anticoagulation use and imbalanced risk factors, IVC filter placement did not increase the risk of new DVT development.  Conclusions and relevance:   This study suggests that, for patients with cancer and DVT and bleeding risk factors, IVC filter placement is associated with an increased rate of PE-free survival.""","""['Samyuktha Balabhadra', 'Joshua D Kuban', 'Stephen Lee', 'Steven Yevich', 'Zeyad Metwalli', 'Colin J McCarthy', 'Steven Y Huang', 'Alda Tam', 'Sanjay Gupta', 'Sunil A Sheth', 'Rahul A Sheth']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Evidence Supporting the Use of Inferior Vena Cava Filters in Patients With Cancer-Coming Into Focus.', 'Comprehensive assessment of prophylactic preoperative inferior vena cava filters for major spinal reconstruction in adults.', 'Efficacy of Retrievable Inferior Vena Cava Filter Placement in the Prevention of Pulmonary Embolism during Catheter-Directed Thrombectomy for Proximal Lower-Extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis.', 'Outcomes after inferior vena cava filter placement in cancer patients diagnosed with pulmonary embolism: risk for recurrent venous thromboembolism.', 'Inferior vena cava filters and postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing bariatric surgery: a meta-analysis.', 'Update on inferior vena cava filters.', 'Inferior Vena Cava Filters and Complications: A Systematic Review.', 'Pulmonary Embolism in the Cancer Associated Thrombosis Landscape.', 'Inferior Vena Cava Filter Use in the Setting of Gastrointestinal Blood Loss, Malignancy, and Multiple Thromboembolisms: A Case Report.', 'Concomitant Deep Vein Thrombosis in Cancer Patients with Unsuspected Pulmonary Embolism.', 'Effects of CDT on Hemodynamics and Quality of Life in a Subgroup of Patients with Lower Limb Deep Vein Thrombosis Carel: A Case-Control Study.']"""

The mitochondrial stress‑70 protein named glucose regulated protein 75 (GRP75), also known as mortalin, is an intriguing cancer pro‑survival factor. It is constitutively expressed in normal tissues but is upregulated in many tumors, and was shown to be a cancer prognostic biomarker. Mortalin is an inhibitor of complement‑dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and may therefore protect cells from antibody‑based immunotherapy. To target mortalin for cancer therapy, our laboratory designed several mortalin mimetic peptides with sequences predicted to be involved in mortalin binding to its client proteins. The peptides were synthesized with a C‑terminal transactivator of transcription sequence. By using cell death methodologies, the mechanism of action of the mortalin mimetic peptides on cancer cells was studied. Two peptides in particular, Mot‑P2 and Mot‑P7, were found to be highly toxic to lymphoma and ovarian, breast and prostate carcinoma cells. The analysis of their mode of action revealed that they may induce, within minutes, plasma membrane perturbations and mitochondrial stress. Furthermore, Mot‑P2 and Mot‑P7 activated necrotic cell death, leading to plasma membrane perforation, mitochondrial inner membrane depolarization and decrease in ATP level. In addition, Mot‑P7, but not Mot‑P2, required extracellular calcium ions to fully mediate cell death and was partially inhibited by plasma membrane cholesterol. At sub‑toxic concentrations, the two peptides moderately inhibited cancer cell proliferation and blocked cell cycle at G2/M. Both peptides may bind intracellularly to mortalin and/or a mortalin‑binding protein, hence knocking down mortalin expression reduced cell death. Combining treatment with Mot‑P2 or Mot‑P7 and CDC resulted in increased cell death. This study identified highly cytotoxic mortalin mimetic peptides that may be used as monotherapy or combined with complement‑activating antibody therapy to target mortalin for precision cancer therapy.""","""['Ritta Jubran', 'Moran Saar-Ray', 'Anna Wawruszak', 'Lea Ziporen', 'Natalie Donin', 'Osnat Bairey', 'Zvi Fishelson']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Mortalin/GRP75 binds to complement C9 and plays a role in resistance to complement-dependent cytotoxicity.', 'SMR peptide antagonizes mortalin promoted release of extracellular vesicles and affects mortalin protection from complement-dependent cytotoxicity in breast cancer cells and leukemia cells.', 'Complement triggers relocation of Mortalin/GRP75 from mitochondria to the plasma membrane.', 'Complement C5b-9 and Cancer: Mechanisms of Cell Damage, Cancer Counteractions, and Approaches for Intervention.', 'Mortalin - a multipotent chaperone regulating cellular processes ranging from viral infection to neurodegeneration.', 'Hydrogen peroxide initiates oxidative stress and proteomic alterations in meningothelial cells.', 'The Chaperone System in Breast Cancer: Roles and Therapeutic Prospects of the Molecular Chaperones Hsp27, Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp90.', 'Why is Mortalin a Potential Therapeutic Target for Cancer?', 'Calcium signaling in neurodevelopment and pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorders.', 'HSP70s in Breast Cancer: Promoters of Tumorigenesis and Potential Targets/Tools for Therapy.']"""

Methods:   From 2007 to 2013, a total of 41,733 PC survivors newly diagnosed with PC in South Korea were identified and matched to non-cancer controls. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to determine the relative risk of fracture.  Results:   Compared to the matched controls, PC survivors had a higher risk of fracture (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.39; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.33-1.45).

Methods:   One hundred twelve patients with prostate cancer (PCa) underwent 2 prostate MRI examinations on the same day. PCa areas were annotated using whole mount prostatectomy sections. Two U-Net-based convolutional neural networks were trained on three different ADCm b value settings for (a) slice- and (b) lesion-level detection and (c) segmentation of csPCa. Short-term test-retest repeatability was estimated using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC(3,1)), proportionate agreement, and dice similarity coefficient (DSC). A 3-fold cross-validation was performed on training set (N = 78 patients) and evaluated for performance and repeatability on testing data (N = 34 patients).  Results:   For the three ADCm b value settings, repeatability of mean ADCm of csPCa lesions was ICC(3,1) = 0.86-0.98. Two CNNs with U-Net-based architecture demonstrated ICC(3,1) in the range of 0.80-0.83, agreement of 66-72%, and DSC of 0.68-0.72 for slice- and lesion-level detection and segmentation of csPCa.

Advanced medical imagining has enabled early-stage identification of cancerous lesions that require needle biopsy for minimally invasive tissue sampling and pathological analysis. Accurate cancer diagnosis depends on the accuracy of needle deployment to the targeted cancerous lesion site. However, currently available needle delivery systems deform and move soft tissue and organs, leading to a non-diagnostic biopsy or undersampling of the target. Two features inspired by the mosquito proboscis were adopted for MPI insertion in prostate biopsy: (1) the harpoon-shape notches at the needle tip and (2) reciprocating needle-cannula motions for incremental insertion. The local tissue deformation and global prostate displacement during the MPI vs. traditional direct insertions were quantified by optically tracking the displacement of particle-embedded tissue-mimicking phantoms. Results show that the MPI needle insertion reduced both local tissue deformation and global prostate displacement because of the opposite needle-cannula motions and notches which stabilized and reduced the tissue deformation during insertion.

Methods:   National population-based cohort of 2,307,565 Australians ages 15 to 89 years, diagnosed with a primary invasive cancer from 1985 to 2014 with mortality follow-up to December 31, 2015. Excess mortality rates and crude probabilities of cancer deaths were estimated using flexible parametric relative survival models. Crude probabilities were then used to calculate ""avoided cancer deaths"" (reduced number of cancer deaths within 10 years of diagnosis due to survival changes since 1985-1994) for all cancers and 13 leading cancer types.  Results:   For each cancer type, excess mortality (in the cancer cohort vs. the expected population mortality) was significantly lower for more recently diagnosed persons. For all cancers combined, the number of ""avoided cancer deaths"" (vs. 1985-1994) was 4,877 (1995-2004) and 11,385 (2005-2014) among males.

Metabolomics can potentially provide new insights into the aetiology of prostate cancer by identifying new metabolic risk factors. This study investigated the prospective association between plasma metabolite concentrations and prostate cancer risk, both overall and by stratifying for disease aggressiveness and baseline age.  Methods:   In a case-control study nested in the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study, pre-diagnostic concentrations of 148 plasma metabolites were determined using targeted mass spectrometry- and nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomics in 777 prostate cancer cases (follow-up ≥ 5 years) and 777 matched controls. Associations between prostate cancer risk and metabolite concentrations were investigated using conditional logistic regression conditioned on matching factors (body mass index, age and sample storage time). Corrections for multiple testing were performed using false discovery rate (20%) and Bonferroni. Metabolomics analyses generated new hypotheses, which were investigated by leveraging food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) and oral glucose tolerance tests performed at baseline.  Results:   After correcting for multiple testing, two lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) were positively associated with risk of overall prostate cancer (all ages and in older subjects). The strongest association was for LPC C17:0 in older subjects (OR = 2.08; 95% CI 1.45-2.98; p < 0.0001, significant also after the Bonferroni correction). Observed associations with risk of overall prostate cancer in younger subjects were positive for glycine and inverse for pyruvate. For aggressive prostate cancer, there were positive associations with six glycerophospholipids (LPC C17:0, LPC C20:3, LPC C20:4, PC ae C38:3, PC ae C38:4 and PC ae C40:2), while there was an inverse association with acylcarnitine C18:2. Moreover, plasma LPC C17:0 concentrations positively correlated with estimated dietary intake of fatty acid C17:0 from the FFQs. The associations between glycerophospholipids and prostate cancer were stronger in case-controls with normal glucose tolerance.  Conclusions:   Several glycerophospholipids were positively associated with risk of overall and aggressive prostate cancer. The strongest association was observed for LPC C17:0.

Rectal spacer may represent a helpful device in order to outdistance rectal wall from clinical target, but its impact on organ motion is still a matter of debate. MRI-Linac is a new frontier in radiation oncology as it allows a superior visualization of the real-time anatomy of the patient and the current highest level of adaptive radiotherapy.  Methods:   We present data regarding a total of 100 fractions in 20 patients who underwent MRI-guided prostate SBRT for low-to-intermediate risk prostate cancer with or without spacer. Translational and rotational shifts were computed on the pre- and post-treatment MRI acquisitions referring to the delivery position for antero-posterior, latero-lateral and cranio-caudal direction, and assessed using the Mann-Whitney U-Test.  Results:   All patients were treated with a five sessions schedule (35 Gy/5fx) using MRI-Linac for a median fraction treatment time of 50 min (range, 46-65). In the entire study sample, median rotational displacement was 0.1° in cranio-caudal, - 0.002° in latero-lateral and 0.01° in antero-posterior direction; median translational shift was 0.11 mm in cranio-caudal, - 0.24 mm in latero-lateral and - 0.22 mm in antero-posterior. A significant difference between spacer and no-spacer patients in terms of rotational shifts in the antero-posterior direction (p = 0.033) was observed; also for translational shifts a positive trend was detected in antero-posterior direction (p = 0.07), although with no statistical significance. We observed statistically significant differences in the pre-treatment planning phase in favor of the spacer cohort for several rectum dose constraints: rectum V32Gy < 5% (p = 0.001), V28 Gy < 10% (p = 0.001) and V18Gy < 35% (p = 0.039). Also for bladder V35 Gy < 1 cc, the use of spacer provided a dosimetric advantage compared to the no-spacer subpopulation (p = 0.04). Furthermore, PTV V33.2Gy > 95% was higher in the spacer cohort compared to the no-spacer one (p = 0.036).  Conclusion:   In our experience, the application of rectal hydrogel spacer for prostate SBRT resulted in a significant impact on rotational antero-posterior shifts contributing to limit prostate intra-fraction motion. Further studies with larger sample size and longer follow-up are required to confirm this ideally favorable effect and to assess any potential impact on clinical outcomes.""","""['Francesco Cuccia', 'Rosario Mazzola', 'Luca Nicosia', 'Vanessa Figlia', 'Niccolò Giaj-Levra', 'Francesco Ricchetti', 'Michele Rigo', 'Claudio Vitale', 'Beatrice Mantoan', 'Antonio De Simone', 'Gianluisa Sicignano', 'Ruggero Ruggieri', 'Stefano Cavalleri', 'Filippo Alongi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['In regard to Cuccia et al.: impact of hydrogel peri-rectal spacer insertion on prostate gland intra-fraction motion during 1.5\u2009T MR-guided stereotactic body radiotherapy.', 'Impact of hydrogel peri-rectal spacer insertion on seminal vesicles intrafraction motion during 1.5\u2009T-MRI-guided adaptive stereotactic body radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Rectal spacer hydrogel in 1.5T MR-guided and daily adapted SBRT for prostate cancer: dosimetric analysis and preliminary patient-reported outcomes.', 'In regard to Cuccia et al.: impact of hydrogel peri-rectal spacer insertion on prostate gland intra-fraction motion during 1.5\u2009T MR-guided stereotactic body radiotherapy.', 'Rectal radiation dose-reduction techniques in prostate cancer: a focus on the rectal spacer.', 'Dose-volume analysis of predictors for chronic rectal toxicity after treatment of prostate cancer with adaptive image-guided radiotherapy.', 'MRI-LINAC: A transformative technology in radiation oncology.', 'Chronological changes of lower urinary tract symptoms after low-dose-rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer using SpaceOAR® system.', '1.5T MR-Guided Daily-Adaptive SBRT for Prostate Cancer: Preliminary Report of Toxicity and Quality of Life of the First 100 Patients.', 'Application of Hydrogel Spacer SpaceOAR Vue for Prostate Radiotherapy.', 'Impact of intrafraction changes in delivered dose of the day for prostate cancer patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy via MR-Linac.']"""

Objective:   We are aiming in this work to synthesize target molecules that possess not only anti-tumor activities but also kinase inhibitors. The target molecules were obtained starting from the benzo[d]imidazole derivatives followed by their heterocyclization reactions to produce anticancer target molecules.  Methods:   The 1-(1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)propan-2-one (3) and the ethyl 2-(1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2- yl)acetate (16) were used as the key starting material which reacted with salicylaldehyde to give the corresponding benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]quinoline derivatives. On the other hand, both of them were reacted with different reagents to give thiophene, pyran and benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidine derivatives. The synthesized compounds were evaluated against the six cancer cell lines A549, HT-29, MKN-45, U87MG, SMMC-7721, and H460 together with inhibitions toward tyrosine kinases, c-Met kinase and prostate cancer cell line PC-3 using the standard MTT assay in vitro, with foretinib as the positive control.  Results:   Most of the synthesized compounds exhibited high inhibitions toward the tested cancer cell lines. In addition, tyrosine and Pim-1 kinases inhibitions were performed for the most active compounds where the variation of substituent through the aryl ring and heterocyclic ring afforded compounds with high activities. Our analysis showed that there is a strong correlation between the structure of the compound and the substituents of target molecules.  Conclusion:   Our present research proved that the synthesized heterocyclic compounds with varieties of substituents have a strong impact on the activity of compounds. The evaluations through different cell lines and tyrosine kinases indicated that the compounds were the excellent candidates as anticancer agents. This could encourage doing further research within this field for the building of compounds with high inhibitions.""","""['Rafat M Mohareb', 'Yara R Milad', 'Bahaa M Mostafa', 'Reem A El-Ansary']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Anticancer Agents Med Chem""","""['Heterocyclization of 2-(2-phenylhydrazono)cyclohexane-1,3-dione to Synthesis Thiophene, Pyrazole and 1,2,4-triazine Derivatives with Anti-Tumor and Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitions.', 'Synthesis and Anti-Proliferative Evaluations of New Heterocyclic Derivatives Using 5,6,8,9-Tetrahydropyrazolo5,1-bquinazolin-7(3H)-one Derivatives Derived from Cyclohexa-1,4-dione.', 'Synthesis of Tetrahydrobenzobthiophene-3-carbohydrazide Derivatives as Potential Anti-cancer Agents and Pim-1 Kinase Inhibitors.', 'Therapeutic targeting of PIM KINASE signaling in cancer therapy: Structural and clinical prospects.', 'Indazole Derivatives: Promising Anti-tumor Agents.']"""

Methods:   The effect of gossypin on cell viability was determined using MTT assay at 5-100μg/ml and cisplatin (50μM) in a time-dependent manner in PC-3 cell lines. The expression levels of caspase-3 (CASP3) and caspase-9 (CASP9) for apoptosis and Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NFKB1) for survival, inflammation, and growth were evaluated by real-time PCR. Hoechst staining was used to analyze apoptosis.  Results:   Gossypin showed an anti-proliferative effect on PC3 cell line in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In addition, gossypin led to a significant increase in apoptosis genes (CASP3, CASP9) when compared to control while it caused a decrease in the level of NFKB1, which is accepted as apoptosis inhibitor (p<0.05) (cisplatin-like). Gossypin 50 and 100μM significantly induced apoptotic mechanism in PC-3 cells. However, no apoptotic or commonly stained nuclei have been observed in control group cells.

Although Wnt/β-catenin is a niche-restricted signaling program, tissue-specific factors that regulate TNKS1 are not known. Here, we report prostate-associated gene 4 (PAGE4) as a tissue-specific TNKS1 inhibitor that robustly represses canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling in human cells, zebrafish, and mice. Structural and biochemical studies reveal that PAGE4 acts as an optimal substrate decoy that potently hijacks substrate binding sites on TNKS1 to prevent AXIN1 PARylation and degradation. Consistently, transgenic expression of PAGE4 in mice phenocopies TNKS1 knockout. Physiologically, PAGE4 is selectively expressed in stromal prostate fibroblasts and functions to establish a proper Wnt/β-catenin signaling niche through suppression of autocrine signaling.

Methods:   Patients treated with IMRT in 2008-2016 were included. Cross sectional examinations of toxicity from the optic pathway, the brain, the pituitary gland and the nose were performed along with quality of life - (QoL) and dose-response analyses.  Results:   Twenty-seven patients were enrolled; median age was 67 years (range 47-83). Five patients (19%) had radiation-related ocular toxicity. The risk of visual acuity impairment increased with increasing dose (grade 2 odds ration (OR) 1.12, p = 0.01; grade 3 OR 1.14, p = 0.02) and dose constraint violations (grade 2, OR = 21, p < 0.01; grade 3, OR = 41, p < 0.01). Six patients (22%) exhibited evidence of radiation-related hypopituitarism, but no dose-response association was detected. Seventeen patients (63%) had impaired olfactory function. The risk of olfactory impairment increased with higher stage (OR = 3.32, p = 0.03). Three patients (11%) had structural abnormalities in irradiated areas of the brain, and impaired cognitive function was present in 17 patients (63%). Cognitive, physical, role functioning as well as fatigue and insomnia were affected the most in QOL analyses. Fifteen patients (56%) had grade 2 radiation-related impairment in at least one organ. Grade 3 toxicity was only present in patients with toxicities in >3 organs and in patients initially treated for T4 tumours.

The objective of the current study was to provide an evidence-based risk estimation for the relatives of patients with PBISN.  Methods:   Nationwide Swedish family cancer data sets were used for the current study, including data regarding all residents of Sweden who were born after 1931 and their parents. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), and lifetime cumulative risks of PCa were calculated for men with different constellations of family history. Family history was defined as a dynamic (time-dependent) variable considering changes during follow-up (1958-2015).  Results:   Of the 6,343,727 men in the current study, a total of 238,961 developed invasive PCa and 5756 were diagnosed with PBISN during the follow-up. Men with 1 first-degree relative who was diagnosed with PBISN had a 70% increased risk of invasive PCa (SIR, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-1.9) and PCa death (SMR, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-2.2) compared with men with no family history of PBISN or invasive PCa. These were rather close to estimates in men with 1 first-degree relative diagnosed with invasive PCa (SIR, 2.1 and SMR, 1.8). A higher risk of PCa in family members was found among patients with a family history of PBISN and/or PCa diagnosed before age 60 years. The results in terms of cumulative risk resembled this trend.  Conclusions:   A family history of PBISN appears to be as important as a family history of invasive PCa with regard to an increased risk of invasive PCa or PCa mortality. Such a history should not be overlooked in PCa screening recommendations or in future research regarding familial PCa.""","""['Xing Xu', 'Mahdi Fallah', 'Yu Tian', 'Trasias Mukama', 'Kristina Sundquist', 'Jan Sundquist', 'Hermann Brenner', 'Elham Kharazmi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Risk of prostate cancer in relatives of prostate cancer patients in Sweden: A nationwide cohort study.', 'Prostate Cancer Risks for Male BRCA1 and BRCA2 Mutation Carriers: A Prospective Cohort Study.', 'Risk of invasive breast cancer in relatives of patients with breast carcinoma in situ: a prospective cohort study.', 'Familial prostate cancer in Sweden.

Tumor metabolism such as lipid metabolism provides sufficient lipids for tumor cell division and rapid growing as well as a vital source for formation of new cellular membranes. Phospholipase Cε (PLCε) is an oncogene that can drive proliferation, progression, and lipid metabolism of tumors, but its effect in lipid metabolism of PCa is not clear. MATERIAL AND METHODS Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and PCa tissue specimens were assessed for SREBP-1, FASN, and PLCε by immunohistochemistry, and PLCε was knocked-down by a lentiviral short hairpin RNA. The mRNA and protein level expression of related factors were tested by qPCR and Western blot analyses. Cell proliferation was assessed by clone formation, CCK-8, and Ki-67 assays. Nile red and oil red O staining were performed to detect endogenous lipid levels. Immunofluorescence was used to localize the protein of SREBP-1. Finally, a tumor xenograft assay of nude mice was performed to assess the role of PLCε in prostate tumor generation. RESULTS We found that overexpression of PLCε indicates low PFS in PCa and is involved in metastasis of PCa, and that the PLCε/AMPK/SREBP-1 signaling network promotes the progression of PCa through lipid metabolism in vivo and in vitro.

Methods:   Six radiologists independently reviewed 200 pairs of axial, high-resolution T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted image data sets, each containing one examination acquired with the FSC and one with the ERC, respectively. Readers selected their preferred examination from each pair and assessed every single examination using six quality criteria on 4-point scales. Signal-to-noise ratios were measured and compared.  Results:   Two readers preferred FSC acquisition (36.5-45%) over ERC acquisition (13.5-15%) for both sequences combined, and four readers preferred ERC acquisition (41-46%). Analysis of pooled responses for both sequences from all readers shows no significant preference for FSC or ERC. Analysis of the individual sequences revealed a pooled preference for the FSC in T2WI (38.7% vs 17.8%) and for the ERC in DWI (50.9% vs 19.6%). Patients' weight was the only weak predictor of a preference for the ERC acquisition (p = 0.04). SNR and CNR were significantly higher in the ERC acquisitions (p<0.001) except CNR differentiating tumor lesions from benign prostate (p=0.1).  Conclusion:   Although readers have strong individual preferences, comparable subjective image quality can be obtained for prostate MRI with an ERC and the novel FSC. ERC imaging might be particularly valuable for sequences with inherently lower SNR as DWI and larger patients whereas the FSC is generally preferred in T2WI.

Methods:   We conducted a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained cohort of 1359 men who underwent RARP, between 2006 and 2019. Patients were followed with uPSA at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36 months and annually thereafter. We included patients with PSA nadir values between 0.01 and 0.1 ng/ml within 6 months of surgery and with at least 2 follow-up measurements within the same range. We divided patients based on their BCR status and analyzed uPSA changes. Multivariable Cox-regression models (CRMs) were used to analyze variables predicting BCR-free survival (BCR-FS).  Results:   We identified 167 (12.3%) patients for analyses, with a mean follow-up time of 60.2 ± 31.4 months. In our cohort, 5-year BCR-FS rate was 86%. Overall, 32 (19.1%) patients had BCR, with a mean time to BCR of 43.7 ± 24.3 months.

Several studies have shown oncogenic or tumor suppressor roles of lncRNAs in different human tissues. Thus, these transcripts have been regarded as putative targets in treatment of cancer. The lncRNA terminal differentiation-induced non-coding RNA (TINCR) has an especial position in this regard, as it exerts different opposite roles in the pathogenesis of different human cancers. While it is up-regulated in gastric, esophageal, bladder and breast cancer; it is down-regulated in glioma, retinoblastoma and prostate cancer. Notably, data regarding expression profile of this lncRNA in a number of human cancers such as colon cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are controversial. Expression level of this lncRNA has been associated with clinical outcome in patients with gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, NSCLC and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier analyses have shown correlation between expression levels of TINCR and patients survival in patients with lung cancer and HCC.

The immunophilin FKBP51, as a co-chaperone protein, together with Hsp90 help the correct folding of AR. Rapamycin is a known small-molecule inhibitor of FKBP51, but its effect on the FKBP51/AR signaling pathway is not clear. In this study, the interaction mechanism between FKBP51 and rapamycin was investigated using steady-state fluorescence quenching, X-ray crystallization, MTT assay, and qRT-PCR. Steady-state fluorescence quenching assay showed that rapamycin could interact with FKBP51. The crystal of the rapamycin-FKBP51 complex indicated that rapamycin occupies the hydrophobic binding pocket of FK1 domain which is vital for AR activity. The residues involving rapamycin binding are mainly hydrophobic and may overlap with the AR interaction site. Further assays showed that rapamycin could inhibit the androgen-dependent growth of human prostate cancer cells by down-regulating the expression levels of AR activated downstream genes. Taken together, our study demonstrates that rapamycin suppresses AR signaling pathway by interfering with the interaction between AR and FKBP51. The results of this study not only can provide useful information about the interaction mechanism between rapamycin and FKBP51, but also can provide new clues for the treatment of prostate cancer and castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Jing Zhang', 'Dan Wu', 'Yongxing He', 'Lanlan Li', 'Shanhui Liu', 'Jianzhong Lu', 'Huiming Gui', 'Yuhan Wang', 'Yan Tao', 'Hanzhang Wang', 'Dharam Kaushik', 'Ronald Rodriguez', 'Zhiping Wang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Rep""","""['The environmental endocrine disruptor p-nitrophenol interacts with FKBP51, a positive regulator of androgen receptor and inhibits androgen receptor signaling in human cells.', 'Restoration of FKBP51 protein promotes the progression of castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen mediated regulation and functional implications of fkbp51 expression in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Crosstalk of the Androgen Receptor with Transcriptional Collaborators: Potential Therapeutic Targets for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Apigenin inhibits angiogenesis in retinal microvascular endothelial cells through regulating of the miR-140-5p/HDAC3-mediated PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway.', 'Androgen Receptor Signaling Inhibition in Advanced Castration Resistance Prostate Cancer: What Is Expected for the Near Future?', 'The role of RHAMM in cancer: Exposing novel therapeutic vulnerabilities.', 'With or without You: Co-Chaperones Mediate Health and Disease by Modifying Chaperone Function and Protein Triage.', 'AR-mTOR-SRF Axis Regulates HMMR Expression in Human Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

In the context of osteogenic differentiation of MSCs and bone homeostasis, the osteoprotegerin/receptor activator of NF-κB ligand/receptor activator of NF-κB (OPG/RANKL/RANK) axis is a critical signaling pathway. The absence or loss of function of p53 has been implicated in aberrant osteogenic differentiation of MSCs that results in higher bone formation versus erosion, leading to an unbalanced bone remodeling. Here, we show by microCT that mice with p53 deletion systemically or specifically in mesenchymal cells possess significantly higher bone density than their respective littermate controls. There is a negative correlation between p53 and OPG both in vivo by analysis of serum from p53+/+, p53+/-, and p53-/- mice and in vitro by p53 knockdown and ChIP assay in MSCs. Notably, high expression of Opg or its combination with low level of p53 are prominent features in clinical cancer lesion of osteosarcoma and prostate cancer respectively, which correlate with poor survival. Intra-bone marrow injection of prostate cancer cells, together with androgen can suppress p53 expression and enhance local Opg expression, leading to an enhancement of bone density. Our results support the notion that MSCs, as osteoblast progenitor cells and one major component of bone microenvironment, represent a cellular source of OPG, whose amount is regulated by the p53 status.

Results: 18F-FSPG PET showed high tumor-to-background ratios with a relatively high tumor detection rate on a per-patient (89%) and per-lobe (87%) basis. The sensitivity was slightly higher with imaging at 105 minutes in comparison with 60 minutes.

To date, no specific predictors have been identified.  Aim:   In this analysis, we sought to find associated pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters.  Methods:   We identified all men in our departmental database who (i) had climacturia post-RP, ≥3 episodes; (ii) underwent a pre-RP endorectal MRI; (iii) had no radiation or androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Soft tissue and bony dimensions were measured by 2 raters blinded to clinical and pathological data.  Outcomes:   MRI parameters included the following: maximum height, width, and depth of prostate, prostate volume, urethral width and length, lower conjugate of pelvis, bony femoral width, outer and inner levator distances and thickness. Point-biserial correlations were run on univariate associations. Logistic regression was used for the multivariable model.  Results:   194 consecutive pre-RP MRI studies were reviewed (56 men with and 138 without climacturia). Mean age was 60 ± 7 years, average time post-RP at assessment, 7 ± 7 months. Of MRI parameters, urethral width (r = 0.13, P = .03) and lower conjugate (r = 0.12, P = .05) were associated with presence of persistent climacturia. 2 others met criteria for multivariable analysis, prostate depth and outer levator distance. Of the non-MRI parameters, none were significantly related to climacturia and only body mass index (BMI) met criteria for multivariable analysis. On multivariable analysis, only urethral width was associated with climacturia (OR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.01-1.49, P = .04); the wider the urethra, greater the chance of climacturia.  Clinical implications:   Improved ability to predict the occurrence of orgasm-associated incontinence in the preoperative setting.  Strengths and limitations:   Limitations include the fact that the MRI endorectal probe may have distorted pelvic tissues during imaging and that our study population size was small. However, prospective data collection, blinded measurements by 2 trained readers, and rigorous statistical analysis should be considered strengths.  Conclusion:   By identifying preoperative risk factors, such as urethral width on MRI, we may be able to better understand the pathophysiology of this condition and furthermore may permit us to better counsel men regarding this postoperative outcome.

However, Enzalutamide only inhibits androgen-dependent AR signaling, enabling intrinsic AR activation via androgen-independent pathways, leading to aggressive castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). We investigated the ability of novel anti-cancer agents, Dp44mT and DpC, to overcome androgen resistance. The effect of Dp44mT and DpC on androgen-dependent and independent AR signaling was assessed in androgen-dependent and -independent PCa cells using 2D- and 3D-tissue culture. The clinically trialed DpC was then examined in vivo and compared to Enzalutamide. These agents uniquely promote AR proteasomal degradation and inhibit AR transcription in PCa cells via the upregulation of c-Jun, potently reducing the AR target, prostate-specific antigen (PSA). These agents also inhibited the activation of key molecules in both androgen-dependent and independent AR signaling (ie, EGFR, MAPK, PI3K), which promote CRPC. The clinically trialed DpC also significantly inhibited PCa tumor growth, AR, and PSA expression in vivo, being more potent than Enzalutamide. DpC is a promising candidate for a unique, structurally distinct generation of AR inhibitors that simultaneously target both androgen-dependent and independent arms of AR signaling. No other therapies exhibit such comprehensive and potent AR suppression, which is critical for overcoming the development of androgen resistance.""","""['Syer C Lim', 'Patric J Jansson', 'Stephen J Assinder', 'Sanaz Maleki', 'Des R Richardson', 'Zaklina Kovacevic']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""FASEB J""","""['Moving Towards Precision Urologic Oncology: Targeting Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer and Mutated Forms of the Androgen Receptor Using the Novel Inhibitor Darolutamide (ODM-201).', 'Niclosamide inhibits androgen receptor variants expression and overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Preclinical Study using Malat1 Small Interfering RNA or Androgen Receptor Splicing Variant 7 Degradation Enhancer ASC-J9® to Suppress Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Mechanisms of drug resistance that target the androgen axis in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', ""Let's Go 3D!

Here, endoxifen levels were compared to CYP2D6 diplotypes, tentative target concentrations and side effects.  Methods:   In total, 118 Swedish premenopausal breast cancer patients diagnosed 2006-2014, with on-going postoperative tamoxifen treatment January 2017, were included. Biobanked DNA from peripheral blood was used for CYP2D6 genotyping by TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction (CYP2D6*1, *3, *4, *5, *6, *9, *10, *41, *1xN). Plasma levels of tamoxifen and 3 major metabolites were quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Clinical information on treatment and side effects was retrospectively obtained from medical records.  Results:   In the final analysis of 114 patients, a clear relationship between CYP2D6 genotype and plasma endoxifen levels was evident. Low endoxifen (1.6-5.2 ng/mL), i.e. below the suggested threshold for clinical efficacy, was found in all patients with 2 reduced-function alleles, 2 null-alleles, or a null/reduced-function combination. CYP2D6*41 was the most common reduced-function allele (82%) and 17 of 21 CYP2D6*41-carriers exhibited a lower CYP2D6 activity than predicted from published guidelines. No difference in endoxifen levels was observed between carriers of 2 null-alleles vs patients homozygous for CYP2D6*41 or the corresponding heterozygous combination (P = .338). In patients with endoxifen levels <5.9 ng/mL (36/114), side effects were either mild or absent. At higher endoxifen levels moderate-to-severe side effects were reported in a concentration-dependent manner.

Temozolomide is the only agent that has been shown to be effective against GBM, suggesting that combination of temozolomide with other agents may be more effective. Niclosamide, an FDA approved anthelmintic agent, has shown anti-cancer effects against human colon, breast, prostate cancers as well as GBM.

Combined effects of two drugs were evaluated by measuring viability, neurosphere formation, and 3D-invasion in collagen matrix. Transcriptional profiles of GBM TS were analyzed using RNA sequencing. In vivo anticancer efficacy of combined drugs was tested in a mouse orthotopic xenograft model.  Results:   Combination treatment of niclosamide and temozolomide significantly inhibited the cell viability, stemness, and invasive properties of GBM TSs.

The surrounding tumor microenvironment (TME) is important in tumor progression, as cytokines and soluble mediators including tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) or lipocalin-2 (LCN2) can influence tumor growth and formation of metastasis. The exact mechanisms on how these pleiotropic factors affect PCa are still unknown. In this study, we showed for the first time that LCN2 mRNA and protein expression are strongly inducible by TNF-α in the highly metastatic human PCa cell line PC-3. In addition, we observed higher levels of secreted LCN2 in cell culture medium of TNF-α-treated PC-3 cells. We found that different signaling pathways such as p38, NF-κB or JNK were activated shortly after TNF-α treatment. Moreover, the mRNA levels of IL-1β and IL-8 were also significantly increased after 24 h stimulation. Mechanistically, the NF-κB pathway and the JNK signaling axis are directly responsible for LCN2 upregulation. This was shown by the fact that pretreatment with the JNK inhibitors SP600125 or JNK-IN-8 strongly downregulated phosphorylation of c-Jun protein and markedly reduced TNF-α-mediated LCN2 upregulation in PC-3 cells. Likewise, the NF-κB inhibitor QNZ was able to repress TNF-α-induced LCN2 expression in PC-3 cells. Taking into consideration that LCN2 has been described as a tumor promoting factor in PCa, our results indicate that JNK regulates LCN2 expression and unmasks the JNK signaling axis as a possible therapeutic target for patients with PCa.""","""['Sarah K Schröder', 'Anastasia Asimakopoulou', 'Stefan Tillmann', 'Steffen Koschmieder', 'Ralf Weiskirchen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cytokine""","""['Proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and TNF-α, induce expression of interleukin-34 mRNA via JNK- and p44/42 MAPK-NF-κB pathway but not p38 pathway in osteoblasts.', 'Transforming growth factor-beta1 activates interleukin-6 expression in prostate cancer cells through the synergistic collaboration of the Smad2, p38-NF-kappaB, JNK, and Ras signaling pathways.', 'NF-κB, ERK, p38 MAPK and JNK contribute to the initiation and/or maintenance of mechanical allodynia induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the red nucleus.', 'TNF-alpha/IL-1/NF-kappaB transduction pathway in human cancer prostate.', 'The link between bone-derived factors osteocalcin, fibroblast growth factor 23, sclerostin, lipocalin 2 and tumor bone metastasis.', 'Rat Hepatic Stellate Cell Line CFSC-2G: Genetic Markers and Short Tandem Repeat Profile Useful for Cell Line Authentication.', 'Genetic Characterization of Rat Hepatic Stellate Cell Line HSC-T6 for In Vitro Cell Line Authentication.', 'Thromboinflammatory Processes at the Nexus of Metabolic Dysfunction and Prostate Cancer: The Emerging Role of Periprostatic Adipose Tissue.', 'Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) Deficiency Leads to Cellular Changes in Highly Metastatic Human Prostate Cancer Cell Line PC-3.', 'The Unfolded Protein Response Is a Major Driver of LCN2 Expression in BCR-ABL- and JAK2V617F-Positive MPN.']"""

Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic properties in different cancers associated to cell metabolism modulation. The latter is of particular interest since metabolic reprogramming is one of PCa hallmarks, but is not clear how this occurs among disease progression. Therefore, we evaluated DHA antiproliferative potential in distinct androgenic backgrounds associated to metabolism modulation and androgen-regulated genes. For this purpose, pre-malignant PNT1A and tumor AR-positive 22rv1, and AR-negative PC3 cells were incubated with DHA at 100 μM-48 h. DHA reduced at least 26% cell number for all lineages due to S-phase decrease in AR-positive and G2/M arrest in AR-negative. Mitochondrial metabolic rate decreased in PNT1A (~38%) and increased in tumor cells (at least 40%). This was associated with ROS overproduction (1.6-fold PNT1A; 2.1 22rv1; 2.2 PC3), lipid accumulation (3-fold PNT1A; 1.8 22rv1; 3.6 PC3) and mitochondria damage in all cell lines. AKT, AMPK and PTEN were not activated in any cell line, but p-ERK1/2 increased (1.5-fold) in PNT1A. Expression of androgen-regulated and nuclear receptors genes showed that DHA affected them in a distinct pattern in each cell line, but most converged to metabolism regulation, response to hormones, lipids and stress.

Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) is the tool of choice for DIL identification; however, the geometry of the prostate on mpMRI and on the TRUS may differ significantly, requiring image registration. This study assesses the dosimetric impact attributed to differences in DIL contours generated using commonly available MRI to TRUS automated registration: rigid, semi-rigid, and deformable image registration, respectively.  Methods and materials:   Ten patients, each with mpMRI and TRUS data sets, were included in this study. Five radiation oncologists with expertise in TRUS-based high-dose-rate brachytherapy were asked cognitively to transfer the DIL from the mpMRI images of each patient to the TRUS image. The contours were analyzed for concordance using simultaneous truth and performance level estimation (STAPLE) algorithm. The impact of DIL contour differences due to registration variability was evaluated by comparing the STAPLE-DIL dosimetry from the reference (STAPLE) plan with that from the evaluation plans (manual and automated registration) for each patient. The dosimetric impact of the automatic registration approach was also validated using a margin expansion that normalizes the volume of the autoregistered DILs to the volumes of the STAPLE-DILs. Dose metrics including D90, Dmean, V150, and V200 to the prostate and DIL were reported. For urethra and rectum, D10 and V80 were reported.  Results:   Significant differences in DIL coverage between reference and evaluation plans were found regardless of the algorithm methodology. No statistical difference was reported in STAPLE-DIL dosimetry when manual registration was used. A margin of 1.5 ± 0.8 mm, 1.1 ± 0.8 mm, and 2.5 ± 1.6 mm was required to be added for rigid, semi-rigid, and deformable registration, respectively, to mitigate the difference in STAPLE-DIL coverage between the evaluation and reference plans.  Conclusion:   The dosimetric impact of integrating an MRI-delineated DIL into a TRUS-based brachytherapy workflow has been validated in this study. The results show that rigid, semi-rigid, and deformable registration algorithms lead to a significant undercoverage of the DIL D90 and Dmean. A margin of at least 1.5 ± 0.8 mm, 1.1 ± 0.8 mm, and 2.5 ± 1.6 mm is required to be added to the rigid, semi-rigid, and deformable DIL registration to be suitable for DIL-boosting during prostate brachytherapy.""","""['Amani Shaaer', 'Moti Paudel', 'Melanie Davidson', 'Mark Semple', 'Alexandru Nicolae', 'Lucas Castro Mendez', 'Hans Chung', 'Andrew Loblaw', 'Chia-Lin Tseng', 'Gerard Morton', 'Ananth Ravi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Multiparametric MRI-guided dose boost to dominant intraprostatic lesions in CT-based High-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'Dose to the dominant intraprostatic lesion using HDR vs. LDR monotherapy: A Phase II randomized trial.', 'A comparison of treatment planning techniques for low-dose-rate (LDR) prostate brachytherapy.', 'The American Brachytherapy Society recommendations for permanent prostate brachytherapy postimplant dosimetric analysis.']"""

Methods:   A retrospective analysis of patients treated with either targeted focal therapy, or subtotal CT for localized prostate cancer was performed. The cohort was stratified by patients who had only had a transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (TRUS) and those who had undergone 1 additional 3DMB before definitive treatment. Pre- and postprocedural Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) surveys were collected. BCF was defined using the Phoenix criteria. Patients with BCF were re-biopsied. Differences in pre/post changes in IPSS and SHIM scores were examined with Mann-Whitney U tests, binary measures with chi-square tests, and pre/post changes in PSA with t tests. A Kaplan-Meier time to BCF and recurrence analysis is presented.  Results:   A total of 534 patients underwent PCT following TRUS only (n = 331) and TRUS with subsequent 3DMB (n = 203) between March 2007 and June 2016. No differences were observed in IPSS (P = .60) or SHIM scores drop (P = .06) between groups. PSA drop seemed more pronounced in the TRUS only biopsy group compared to the 3DMB, but again without statistical significance (P = .06). Recurrence rate and BCF were lower in the 3DMB group (P <.01). There was a higher rate of short-term complications detected in the TRUS only group (P = .02).  Conclusion:   BCF and local recurrence rates were lower among patients who underwent a confirmatory 3DMB before PCT, most likely due to better risk stratification in these patients.

It has been reported to trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD) in animal model studies, but the underlying mechanism is not fully understood yet, especially not in prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   ICD was determined by assessing the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) in the prostate cancer-derived cell lines LNCaP, 22RV1 and PC-3. Short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) were used to knock down target gene expression. Phagocytosis was assessed using a dual labeling technology in dendric cells co-cultured with cancer cells. The PERK gene promoter was cloned for dual luciferase assays. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was used to determine p53 protein-DNA binding activity. Immunocompetent mice and murine RM-1 prostate cancer cells were used for vaccination experiments.  Results:   MTX treatment induced typical characteristics of DAMP release, including increased cell surface exposure of calreticulin (CALR), and extracellular release of ATP and high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) protein. MTX also enhanced phagocytosis by dendritic cells. Moreover, MTX treatment increased eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) S51 phosphorylation, which was reduced when PERK and GCN2 were silenced using shRNAs. In addition, PERK or GCN2 silencing significantly reduced MTX-induced release of DAMPs in vitro and anti-tumor immunity in vivo. MTX treatment also resulted in dendritic cell activation in mice, which was attenuated when PERK or GCN2 were silenced in cancer cells used for vaccination. Further analysis revealed that PERK and GCN2 expression was enhanced by MTX treatment, of which PERK, but not GCN2, was enhanced via a p53-dependent mechanism.  Conclusion:   MTX triggers ICD by activating eIF2α via PERK/GCN2 upregulation in prostate cancer cells.

While it provides a measure of discrimination over the entire follow-up period of a study, the probability does not provide information on the longitudinal durability of a baseline risk score. It is possible that a baseline risk model is able to segregate short-term from long-term survivors but unable to maintain its discriminatory strength later in the follow-up period. As a consequence, this would motivate clinicians to re-evaluate the risk score longitudinally. This longitudinal re-evaluation may not, however, be feasible in many scenarios since a single baseline evaluation may be the only data collectible due to treatment or other clinical or ethical reasons. In these scenarios, an attenuation of the discriminatory power of the patient risk score over time would indicate decreased clinical utility and call into question whether this score should remain a prognostic tool at later time points. Working within the concordance probability paradigm, we propose a method to address this clinical scenario and evaluate the discriminatory power of a baseline derived risk score over time.

Determination of drug treatment patterns can improve our understanding of the mechanisms of drug action, enabling drug repurposing. A drug can be associated with a multilayer tissue-specific protein-protein interaction (TSPPI) network for the diseases it is used to treat. Proteins usually interact with other proteins to achieve functions that cause diseases. Hence, studying drug treatment patterns is similar to studying common module structures in multilayer TSPPI networks. Therefore, we propose a network-based model to study the treatment patterns of drugs. The method was designated SDTP (studying drug treatment pattern) and was based on drug effects and a multilayer network model. To demonstrate the application of the SDTP method, we focused on analysis of trichostatin A (TSA) in leukemia, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. We constructed a TSPPI multilayer network and obtained candidate drug-target modules from the network. Gene ontology analysis provided insights into the significance of the drug-target modules and co-expression networks. Finally, two modules were obtained as potential treatment patterns for TSA. Through analysis of the significance, composition, and functions of the selected drug-target modules, we validated the feasibility and rationality of our proposed SDTP method for identifying drug treatment patterns. In summary, our novel approach used a multilayer network model to overcome the shortcomings of single-layer networks and combined the network with information on drug activity. Based on the discovered drug treatment patterns, we can predict the potential diseases that the drug can treat. That is, if a disease-related protein module has a similar structure, then the drug is likely to be a potential drug for the treatment of the disease.""","""['Liang Yu', 'Yayong Shi', 'Quan Zou', 'Shuhang Wang', 'Liping Zheng', 'Lin Gao']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['MNBDR: A Module Network Based Method for Drug Repositioning.', ""Repositioning drugs by targeting network modules: a Parkinson's disease case study."", 'Transcription factor network analysis based on single cell RNA-seq identifies that Trichostatin-a reverses docetaxel resistance in prostate Cancer.', 'Network-based Drug Repurposing: A Critical Review.', 'Application of Multilayer Network Models in Bioinformatics.', 'Maximal Information Coefficient-Based Testing to Identify Epistasis in Case-Control Association Studies.', 'Identify DNA-Binding Proteins Through the Extreme Gradient Boosting Algorithm.', 'SNAREs-SAP: SNARE Proteins Identification With PSSM Profiles.', 'Application of Sparse Representation in Bioinformatics.', 'iAIPs: Identifying Anti-Inflammatory Peptides Using Random Forest.']"""

Biomarker discovery is often unstable with, for example, small changes in discovery dataset configuration resulting in large alterations in biomarker composition. Our hypothesis, which forms the basis of this current study, is that highly significant overlaps occurring between gene signatures obtained using entirely different approaches indicate genes fundamental for controlling cancer progression. For prostate cancer, we found two sets of signatures that had significant overlaps suggesting important genes (p < 10-34 for paired overlaps, hypergeometrical test). These overlapping signatures defined a core set of genes linking hormone signalling (HES6-AR), cell cycle progression (Prolaris) and a molecular subgroup of patients (PCS1) derived by Non Negative Matrix Factorization (NNMF) of control pathways, together designated as SIG-HES6. The second set (designated SIG-DESNT) consisted of the DESNT diagnostic signature and a second NNMF signature PCS3. Stratifications using SIG-HES6 (HES6, PCS1, Prolaris) and SIG-DESNT (DESNT) classifiers frequently detected the same individual high-risk cancers, indicating that the underlying mechanisms associated with SIG-HES6 and SIG-DESNT may act together to promote aggressive cancer development. We show that the use of combinations of a SIG-HES6 signature together with DESNT substantially increases the ability to predict poor outcome, and we propose a model for prostate cancer development involving co-operation between the SIG-HES6 and SIG-DESNT pathways that has implication for therapeutic design.""","""['Bogdan-Alexandru Luca', 'Vincent Moulton', 'Christopher Ellis', 'Shea P Connell', 'Daniel S Brewer', 'Colin S Cooper']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Genes (Basel)""","""['A TMEFF2-regulated cell cycle derived gene signature is prognostic of recurrence risk in prostate cancer.', 'DESNT: A Poor Prognosis Category of Human Prostate Cancer.', 'Ribonucleotide reductase small subunit M2 is a master driver of aggressive prostate cancer.', 'RNA biomarkers to facilitate the identification of aggressive prostate cancer.', 'Prostate Cancer Transcriptomic Subtypes.', 'Combining Molecular Subtypes with Multivariable Clinical Models Has the Potential to Improve Prediction of Treatment Outcomes in Prostate Cancer at Diagnosis.', 'Derivation and Application of Molecular Signatures to Prostate Cancer: Opportunities and Challenges.']"""

Here we investigate whether blocking the transcriptional activities of full-length AR and AR-Vs with ralaniten leads to enhanced sensitivity to radiotherapy. Combination therapies using ralaniten with ionizing radiation were evaluated for effects on proliferation, colony formation, cell cycle, DNA damage, and Western blot analyses in human prostate cancer cells that express both full-length AR and AR-Vs. Ralaniten and a potent next-generation analog (EPI-7170) decreased expression of DNA repair genes whereas enzalutamide had no effect. FACS analysis revealed a dose-dependent decrease of BrdU incorporation with increased accumulation of γH2AX with a combination of ionizing radiation with ralaniten. An additive inhibitory effect on proliferation of enzalutamide-resistant cells was achieved with a combination of ralaniten compounds with ionizing radiation.

As root extracts may be another source of pharmaceutical compounds, the CH2Cl2/MeOH (1:1) root bark extract was studied in this report. Eight root bark compounds were isolated and their structural identities were confirmed by mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (using COSY, HSQC, NOESY and HMBC) analyses. The structural identities were determined as follows: the fatty acid-myristic acid (1); the sterol-stigmasterol (2); the lignan-sesamin (3); two β-carboline alkaloids-10-methoxycanthin-6-one (6) and canthin-6-one (7); and three phenanthridine alkaloids-8-acetonyldihydrochelerythrine (4), arnottianamide (5) and 8-oxochelerythrine (8). Some of these compounds were identified in the species for the first time. These compounds and the extract were then tested in vitro against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213) and Candida albicans (ATCC 10231) before tests for antiproliferative activity against the human breast cancer (HCC 1395), human prostate cancer (DU 145) and normal (Vero E6) cell lines were conducted. Minimum inhibition concentration values of 3.91, 1.95, 0.98 and 7.81 µg/mL against MRSA, S. aureus, E. coli and C. albicans, respectively, were recorded. Among the isolates, canthin-6-one was the most active, followed by 10-methoxycanthin-6-one. The root extract and some of the compounds also had antiproliferative activity against the HCC 1395 cell line. Stigmasterol and canthin-6-one had IC50 values of 7.2 and 0.42. The root bark extract also showed activity, at 8.12 µg/mL, against the HCC 1395 cells.

Methods:   This study included 400 patients with prostate cancer who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. Patients using 0 or 1 pad/day within 3 months after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy were categorized into the ""good"" group, whereas the other patients were categorized into the ""bad"" group. Magnetic resonance imaging DICOM data, and preoperative and intraoperative covariates were assessed. To evaluate the deep learning models from the testing dataset, their sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were analyzed. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping was used to visualize the regions of deep learning interest.  Results:   The combination of deep learning and naive Bayes algorithm using axial magnetic resonance imaging in addition to clinicopathological parameters had the highest performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 77.5% for predicting early recovery from post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence, whereas machine learning using clinicopathological parameters only achieved low performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 62.2%. The gradient-weighted class activation mapping methods showed that deep learning focused on pelvic skeletal muscles in patients in the good group, and on the perirectal and hip joint regions in patients in the bad group.

Traditionally, this is performed according to the trans-vescical (Freyer) or trans-capsular (Millin) technique. We recently described a novel urethra-sparing (Madigan) robotic technique which showed promising preliminary results. In this study, we compared the above techniques for perioperative and 1-year patient-reported outcomes.  Methods:   We retrospectively collected data from patients who underwent RASP across the three techniques, performed by two experienced surgeons in our center. We assessed patient self-reported pre-operative and post-operative functional outcomes with validated questionnaires: IPSS, IIEF short form, ICIQ short form, MSHQ Short Form. Continuous and categorical variables were compared between groups using the Mood's median test and the Chi-square tests, respectively.  Results:   Millin, Madigan and Freyer procedures were performed in 23 (51%), 14 (31%) and 8 (18%) cases, respectively. No significant differences were observed for baseline ASA score, BMI, prostate volume, IPSS, IIEF, ICIQ and MSHQ scores (all p ≥ 0.2), as well as post-operative obstructive symptoms relief (IPSS: p = 0.25), continence (ICIQ: p = 0.54), complication rates (p = 0.32) and hospital stay (p = 0.23).

PSMA-PET is effective especially for regional detection of biochemical recurrence, which significantly affects patient management. Herein, we established and optimized a one-step radiolabeling protocol to separate and purify [18F]PSMA-1007 with a CFN-MPS200 synthesizer for clinical application.  Results:   A dedicated single use cassette and synthesis program for [18F]PSMA-1007 was generated using a single-step method for direct precursor radiolabeling. In the cassette, three tube types (fluoro-elastomer, PharMed® BPT, silicone) and two different precursor salts (trifluoroacetic acid or acetic acid) were compared for optimization. Furthermore, three-lot tests were performed under optimized conditions for quality confirmation. Activity yields and mean radiochemical purity of [18F]PSMA-1007 were > 5000 MBq and 95%, respectively, at the end of synthesis, and the decay-corrected mean radiochemical yield from all three cassettes was approximately 40% using a trifluoroacetic acid salt precursor. Fluoro-elastomer tubings significantly increased the amount of non-radioactive PSMA-1007 (8.5 ± 3.1 μg/mL) compared to those with other tubings (0.3 μg/mL). This reduced the molar activity of [18F]PSMA-1007 synthesized in the cassette assembled by fluoro-elastomer tubings (46 GBq/μmol) compared to that with PharMed® BPT and silicone tubings (1184 and 1411 GBq/μmol, respectively). Residual tetrabutylammonium, acetonitrile, and dimethyl sulfoxide levels were < 2.6 μg/mL, < 8 ppm, and < 11 ppm, respectively, and ethanol content was 8.0-8.1% in all three cassettes and two different salts. Higher activity yields, radiochemical purities, and decay-corrected radiochemical yields were obtained using an acetic acid salt precursor rather than a trifluoroacetic acid salt precursor (7906 ± 1216 MBq, 97% ± 0%, and 56% ± 4%). In the three-lot tests under conditions optimized with silicone cassettes and acetic acid salt precursor, all quality items passed the specifications required for human use.  Conclusions:   We successfully automated the production of [18F]PSMA-1007 for clinical use and optimized synthesis procedures with a CFN-MPS200 synthesizer using a silicone cassette and acetic acid salt precursor.

Experimental design:   One hundred and one tumors from men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who had not been treated with enzalutamide (n = 64) or who had enzalutamide-resistant mCRPC (n = 37) underwent whole genome sequencing. Ninety-nine of these tumors also underwent RNA sequencing. We analyzed the genomes and transcriptomes of these mCRPC tumors.  Results:   Copy number loss was more common than gain in enzalutamide-resistant tumors. Specially, we identified 124 protein-coding genes that were more commonly lost in enzalutamide-resistant samples. These 124 genes included eight putative tumor suppressors located at nine distinct genomic regions. We demonstrated that focal deletion of the 17q22 locus that includes RNF43 and SRSF1 was not present in any patient with enzalutamide-naïve mCRPC but was present in 16% (6/37) of patients with enzalutamide-resistant mCRPC. 17q22 loss was associated with lower RNF43 and SRSF1 expression and poor overall survival from time of biopsy [median overall survival of 19.3 months in 17q22 intact vs. 8.9 months in 17q22 loss, HR, 3.44 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.338-8.867, log-rank P = 0.006]. Finally, 17q22 loss was linked with activation of several targetable factors, including CDK1/2, Akt, and PLK1, demonstrating the potential therapeutic relevance of 17q22 loss in mCRPC.  Conclusions:   Copy number loss is common in enzalutamide-resistant tumors.

Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed our institutional database for patients with prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) between 1994 and 2017. In total, we included 633 patients with low-risk prostate cancer in the study. We investigated the effects of clinicopathologic factors on ISUP score upgrade.

Results:   The mean age and follow-up periods were 61.09±6.61 years and 41.9±1.8 months, respectively. ISUP score upgrade was observed in 207 patients (32.7%). In multivariate analysis, high prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density and percentage of positive cores were found to be significantly associated with ISUP score upgrade (p = 0.003 and p = 0.003, respectively). The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-lymphocyte ratio, monocyte-lymphocyte ratio, and eosinophil-lymphocyte ratio were found to have no effect on ISUP score upgrade (p = 0.856, p = 0.353, p = 0.128, and p = 0.074, respectively).

Methods: Totally 49 patients underwent taTME and 478 patients underwent conventional TME at Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Peking University People's Hospital from January 2015 to December 2019 were retrospectively collected. Propensity score matching method was used to perform 1 versus 1 matching between the taTME and conventional TME groups, and 36 pairs of patients were successfully matched. After matching, the median age of patients in taTME group and conventional TME group was 60.5 (16.0) years and 60.5 (13.0) years (M(Q(R))), respectively, and the proportion of male patients was 66.7% (24/36) and 55.6% (20/36) , respectively. EORTC QLQ-C30 scale was used to assess quality of life, low anterior resection syndrome (LARS) scale and Wexner constipation score were used to evaluate anal function, international prostate symptom score (IPSS) was used to evaluate urinary function,international index of erectile function (IIEF) -5 and female sexual function index (FSFI) score were used to evaluate male and female sexual function, respectively, and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7) and patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) scale were used to evaluate psych function. The t test, Mann-Whitney U test, χ(2) test, and Fisher exact test were used for comparison between groups, and Wilcoxon rank sum test or McNemar test was used for comparison between paired data. Results: There were no significant differences in surgery time, postoperative hospital stays, conversion rate, morbidity rate, surgery cost, and numbers of lymph node yield between the two groups (all P>0.05). Compared with the conventional TME group, the intraoperative blood loss in the taTME group was significantly higher (100 (100) ml vs. 80 (50) ml, U=424.5, P=0.010), the prophylactic stoma rate was significantly higher (96.9%(31/36) vs. 63.6%(21/36), χ(2)=11.218, P<0.01), the total hospitalization cost was significantly lower (74 297.7 (16 746.4) CNY vs. 91 781.3 (26 228.4) CNY, U=413.0, P=0.008). There were no significant differences in anal and urinary function between the two groups (LARS scalescore: Z=-0.513, P=0.608, Wexner constipation score: Z=-0.992, P=0.321, IPSS: Z=-1.807, P=0.071). In terms of psych function, significant difference in GAD-7 scale was seen between the two groups (Z=-2.311, P=0.021), patients with generalized anxiety disorder accounting for 26.7% (8/30) and 46.9% (15/32), respectively. Conclusions: Compared with conventional TME surgery, taTME has a significantly increased blood loss and prophylactic stoma rate.

Serum γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) activity has been reported to be a prognostic marker for several types of cancer including RCC. Exosomes or small extracellular vesicles present in body fluids have potential as a biomarker. We have recently demonstrated that GGT activity on exosomes isolated from serum is useful for the differential diagnosis of prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia. In this study, we aimed to examine if serum exosomal GGT activity could be a marker for RCC.  Methods:   We examined GGT1 expression and GGT activity in cell lysates and exosomes from culture medium of HK-2 proximal tubule epithelial and RCC cell lines. GGT activity was measured using a fluorescent probe for GGT, γ-glutamyl hydroxymethyl rhodamine green. Serum and serum exosomal GGT activities were measured in patients with RCC. GGT1 expression in RCC tissues was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining.  Results:   GGT1 levels in exosomes from KMRC-1, OS-RC-2 and 786-O cells were elevated compared with those from HK-2 cells. In exosomes, GGT1 expression correlated with GGT activity determined using a fluorescent probe for GGT. In RCC patients, serum exosomal GGT activity was elevated in those with advanced stages (III/IV vs. I/II, p = 0.037) and those with microvascular invasion (with vs. without, p = 0.034). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that membranous GGT1 expression was increased in RCC with microvascular invasion. Notably, preoperative serum exosomal GGT activity could predict the likelihood of having microvascular invasion diagnosed by pathological examination of surgically resected specimens.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that serum exosomal GGT activity could be a clinically useful marker for advanced clinicopathological features of RCC patients, and its combined use with conventional diagnostic modalities may improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients.""","""['Kengo Horie', 'Kyojiro Kawakami', 'Yasunori Fujita', 'Yoko Matsuda', 'Tomio Arai', 'Natsuko Suzui', 'Tatsuhiko Miyazaki', 'Takuya Koie', 'Kosuke Mizutani', 'Masafumi Ito']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Oncology""","""['Gamma-glutamyltransferase activity in exosomes as a potential marker for prostate cancer.', 'Preoperative serum-gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) does not represent an independent prognostic factor in a European cohort of patients with non-metastatic renal cell carcinoma.', 'Pretherapeutic gamma-glutamyltransferase is an independent prognostic factor for patients with renal cell carcinoma.', 'A Systematic Review of Serum γ-Glutamyltransferase as a Prognostic Biomarker in Patients with Genitourinary Cancer.', 'Pancreatic cancer diagnosis by free and exosomal miRNA.', 'The Roles of Extracellular Vesicles in the Progression of Renal Cell Carcinoma and Their Potential for Future Clinical Application.', 'MicroRNA-142-3p promotes renal cell carcinoma progression by targeting RhoBTB3 to regulate HIF-1 signaling and GGT/GSH pathways.', 'Role of tumor-derived exosomes in metastasis, drug resistance and diagnosis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'Extracellular vesicles and particles impact the systemic landscape of cancer.', 'Roles of exosomes as drug delivery systems in cancer immunotherapy: a mini-review.']"""

In silico analysis predicted the interaction between LINC01207 and miR-1972 as well as the interaction between miR-1972 and the mRNAs LIM and SH3 protein 1 (LASP1). Thus, we explored the role of LINC01207 and miR-1972 in the growth and progression of prostate cancer. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed that LINC01207 and LASP1 were highly expressed in prostate cancer, while miR-1972 expression was lower. The interaction among LINC01207, miR-1972, and LASP1 was confirmed by RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization, RNA immunoprecipitation, and dual luciferase reporter assay, which verified that LINC01207 could bind to miR-1972 and downregulate miR-1972, and miR-1972 targeted LASP1 and negatively regulated its expression. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments found that silencing LINC01207 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor formation and enhanced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells, suggesting that LINC01207 functioned as a tumor promoter in prostate cancer and that it may represent a novel therapeutic target.""","""['Sugui Wang', 'Jianguo Qiu', 'Liping Wang', 'Ziyu Wu', 'Xianyun Zhang', 'Qiang Li', 'Fujin Jiang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""IUBMB Life""","""['Circ_0023028 contributes to the progression of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma by upregulating LASP1 through miR-486-3p.', 'Long non-coding DANCR targets miR-185-5p to upregulate LIM and SH3 protein 1 promoting prostate cancer via the FAK/PI3K/AKT/GSK3β/snail pathway.', 'Tumor-suppressive microRNA-218 inhibits cancer cell migration and invasion via targeting of LASP1 in prostate cancer.', 'LASP1 in Tumor and Tumor Microenvironment.', 'LASP1 in Cellular Signaling and Gene Expression: More than Just a Cytoskeletal Regulator.', 'Relationship of micro-RNA, mRNA and eIF Expression in Tamoxifen-Adapted MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cells: Impact of miR-1972 on Gene Expression, Proliferation and Migration.', 'LINC01207 promotes prostate cancer progression by sponging miR-1182 to upregulate AKT3.', 'Long Noncoding Competing Endogenous RNA Networks in Pancreatic Cancer.', 'miR-199a-3p plays an anti-tumorigenic role in lung adenocarcinoma by suppressing anterior gradient 2.', 'Downregulation of MIAT reduces the proliferation and migratory and invasive abilities of retinoblastoma cells by sponging miR-665 and regulating LASP1.']"""

The aim of this study was to evaluate the methanol crude extract and various fractions of increasing polarity of J. mimosifolia leaves for bioactive metabolites, as well as antimicrobial, antioxidant and anticancer activities. The anti-inflammatory potential of the various fractions of J. mimosifolia leaf extract was studied via the lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitory assay. Methanol crude extract (ME), derived fractions extracted with chloroform (CF) and ethyl acetate (EAF), and residual aqueous extract (AE) of dried J. mimosifolia leaves were assayed for polyphenolic compounds, their antioxidant, antimicrobial and lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitory activities, and anticancer properties. Polyphenolic compounds were determined via HPLC while phytochemicals (total phenolics, flavonoids, tannins and ortho-diphenol contents), antioxidant activities (DPPH, hydrogen peroxideperoxide, hydroxyl and superoxide radical anions) and LOX were measured via spectrophotometry. Methanol extracts and various fractions were evaluated for antibacterial activities against Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Antifungal potential of the fractions was tested against three species: Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus and Fusarium oxysporum. The highest values for total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), flavonols, tannins and ortho-diphenols were in the ME, followed by CF > EAF > AE. ME also had the highest antioxidant activity with EC50 values 48±1.3, 45±2.4, 42±1.3 and 46±1.3 μg/mL based on the DPPH, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical and superoxide radical assays, respectively. TPC and TFC showed a significant, strong and positive correlation with the values for each of these antioxidant activities. ME exhibited anti-inflammatory potential based on its LOX inhibitory activity (IC50 = 1.3 μg/mL). ME also had the maximum antibacterial and antifungal potential, followed by EAF > CF > AE. Furthermore, ME showed the strongest cytotoxic effect (EC50 = 10.7 and 17.3 μg/mL) against human hormone-dependent prostate carcinoma (LnCaP) and human lung carcinoma (LU-1) cell lines, respectively. Bioactive compounds present in leaf methanol extracts of J. mimosifolia were identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Fifteen compounds were identified including phenolic and alcoholic compounds, as well as fatty acids.

A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) for prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy via either IGRT or routine care reported statistically significantly worse overall survival (OS) for those patients treated with IGRT. This raised the concern regarding the effectiveness of IGRT in definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (dCCRT) for locally advanced lung cancer (LALC).  Methods:   Eligible LALC patients diagnosed between 2011 and 2016 were identified via the Taiwan Cancer Registry. We used propensity score (PS) weighting to balance observable potential confounders between groups. The hazard ratio (HR) of death and other outcomes were compared between IGRT and non-IGRT. We also evaluated OS in various subgroups.  Results:   Our primary analysis consisted of 797 patients in whom covariates were well balanced after PS weighing. The HR for death when IGRT was compared with non-IGRT was 0.96 (95% confidence interval 0.79-1.15, P = 0.65). There were also no significant differences for most of the other outcomes or subgroup analyses.  Conclusions:   In this updated nonrandomized study, we found that OS of LALC patients treated with dCCRT was not statistically different between those treated with IGRT versus non-IGRT. The results should be interpreted with caution given the nonrandomized design. Studies regarding toxicity, local control, or designed as RCT are needed to clarify the role of IGRT.  Key points:   SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS OF THE STUDY: The OS of LALC patients treated with dCCRT was not statistically different between those treated with IGRT versus those without IGRT, although the observed HR for death was less than unity (ie, in favor of IGRT).  What this study adds:   In this updated nonrandomized study using real world data with additional potential confounders, our study provided a reasonable tentative evidence in the lack of RCT as suggested in the literature.""","""['Ji-An Liang', 'Chih-Yen Tu', 'Te-Chun Hsia', 'Hsin-Yuan Fang', 'Chia-Chin Li', 'Chun-Ru Chien']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Thorac Cancer""","""['Effectiveness of Image-Guided Radiotherapy in Adjuvant Radiotherapy on Survival for Localized Breast Cancer: A Population-Based Analysis.', 'Effectiveness of image-guided radiotherapy for locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients treated with definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy.', 'Effectiveness of image-guided radiotherapy for rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy: A population-based propensity score-matched analysis.', 'Concurrent chemoradiotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Optimisation of chemotherapy and radiotherapy for untreated Hodgkin lymphoma patients with respect to second malignant neoplasms, overall and progression-free survival: individual participant data analysis.', 'Respiration-controlled radiotherapy in lung cancer: Systematic evaluation of the optimal application practice.', 'Effectiveness of Image-Guided Radiotherapy in Adjuvant Radiotherapy on Survival for Localized Breast Cancer: A Population-Based Analysis.', 'GOECP/SEOR radiotherapy guidelines for small-cell lung cancer.']"""

We used a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to examine how nmCRPC patients and caregivers perceive the benefits versus risks of these new treatments.  Methods:   An online DCE survey with 14 treatment choice questions was administered to nmCRPC patients and caregivers. Each choice question compared two hypothetical medication profiles varying in terms of 5 safety attributes (risk or severity of adverse events [AEs]: fatigue, skin rash, cognitive problems, serious fall, and serious fracture) and two efficacy attributes (duration of overall survival [OS] and time to pain progression). Random parameters logit models were used to estimate each attribute's relative importance. We also estimated the amounts of OS that respondents were willing to forego for a reduction in AEs.  Results:   In total, 143 nmCRPC patients and 149 caregivers viewed the AEs in following order of importance (most to least): serious fracture, serious fall, cognitive problems, fatigue, and skin rash. On average, patients were willing to trade 5.8 and 4.0 months of OS to reduce the risk of serious fracture and fall, respectively, from 3% to 0%; caregivers were willing to trade 6.6 and 5.4 months of OS.

Previous research has shown that the way health information is framed influences individuals' preferences and choices. We operationalized gain-loss framing as physicians' choice of words related to gains (cancer survival), or losses (cancer mortality). In an exploratory analysis, we investigated (a) whether physicians used gain or loss words as a function of their recommendation, (b) whether physicians' choice of words was associated with patients' treatment choices. We analyzed transcribed consultations with male patients who had intermediate-risk prostate cancer. Using an iterative process of gathering and evaluating words, we created gain- and loss-dictionaries. The loss-dictionary included words related to cancer death and cancer progression. The gain-dictionary included words related to survival and cure. Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software, we calculated the number of words related to gains and losses in each transcript. We found that physicians who recommended immediate cancer treatment for prostate cancer (vs. active surveillance) used slightly fewer words related to losses and significantly fewer words related specifically to death from cancer. Further analysis showed that loss words were associated with the patient's choice of immediate cancer treatment. A novel method of automated text analysis showed that physicians' use of loss words was correlated with physicians' recommendations for cancer treatment versus active surveillance. Additionally, loss words in consultations were associated with patients' choice of cancer treatment.""","""['Ilona Fridman', 'Angela Fagerlin', 'Karen A Scherr', 'Laura D Scherer', 'Hanna Huffstetler', 'Peter A Ubel']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Behav Med""","""[""Shared decision making, physicians' explanations, and treatment satisfaction: a cross-sectional survey of prostate cancer patients."", 'The Physician Recommendation Coding System (PhyReCS): A Reliable and Valid Method to Quantify the Strength of Physician Recommendations During Clinical Encounters.', 'Characteristics and Correlates of Word Use in Physician-Patient Communication.', ""Choose Your Words Wisely: The Impact of Message Framing on Patients' Responses to Treatment Advice."", ""Patient preferences versus physicians' judgement: does it make a difference in healthcare decision making?"", 'Prospect Theory: A Bibliometric and Systematic Review in the Categories of Psychology in Web of Science.', 'The joint effect of framing and defaults on choice behavior.', 'Experience Measures after Radical Prostatectomy: A Register-Based Study Evaluating the Association between Patient-Reported Symptoms and Quality of Information.', 'Four reasons why too many informed consents to clinical research are invalid: a critical analysis of current practices.']"""

The initial four-compartment (air, water, fat, soft tissue) Dixon-based AC scheme has since been expanded with several features, the latest being MR field-of-view extension and a bone atlas. As this potentially changes quantification, we evaluated the impact of these features in PET AC in prostate cancer patients.  Methods:   Two hundred prostate cancer patients were examined with either 18F- or 68Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/MR. Qualitative and quantitative analysis (SUVmean, SUVmax, correlation, and statistical significance) was performed on images reconstructed using different AC schemes: Dixon, Dixon+MLAA, Dixon+HUGE, and Dixon+HUGE+bones for 18F-PSMA data; Dixon and Dixon+bones for 68Ga-PSMA data. Uptakes were compared using linear regression against standard Dixon.  Results:   High correlation and no visually perceivable differences between all evaluated methods (r > 0.996) were found. The mean relative difference in lesion uptake of 18F-PSMA and 68Ga-PSMA remained, respectively, within 4% and 3% in soft tissue, and within 10% and 9% in bones for all evaluated methods. Bone registration errors were detected, causing mean uptake change of 5% in affected lesions.  Conclusions:   Based on these results and the encountered bone atlas registration inaccuracy, we deduce that including bones and extending the MR field-of-view did not introduce clinically significant differences in PSMA diagnostic accuracy and tracer uptake quantification in prostate cancer pelvic lesions, facilitating the analysis of serial studies respectively.

Advancement in radiation delivery techniques has led to highly accurate targeting of tumor and sparing of normal tissue; however, in the pelvic region it is anatomically difficult to avoid off-target radiation exposure to other organs. Chronically the effects of normal urogenital tissue exposure can lead to urinary frequency, urinary incontinence, proctitis, and erectile dysfunction. Most of these symptoms are caused by radiation-induced fibrosis and reduce the quality of life for cancer survivors. We have observed in animal models that the severity of radiation-induced fibrosis in normal tissue correlates to damaged fat reservoirs in the pelvic region. We hypothesize that adipocytes may secrete a factor that prevents the induction of radiation-associated fibrosis in normal tissues. In these studies we show that the adipokine, adiponectin, is secreted by primary mouse adipocytes and protects fibroblasts from radiation-induced cell death, myofibroblast formation, and senescence. Further, we demonstrated that adiponectin does not protect colorectal or prostate cancer cells from radiation-induced death.

While cfDNA samples can be obtained using a broad variety of approaches, there is an urgent need to standardize analytical tools aimed at assessing its basic properties. Typical methods to determine the yield and fragment size distribution of cfDNA samples are usually either blind to genomic DNA contamination or the presence of enzymatic inhibitors, which can confound and undermine downstream analyses. Here, we present a novel droplet digital PCR assay to identify suboptimal samples and aberrant cfDNA size distributions, the latter typically associated with high levels of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA).

Independently of its previously identified role in mitophagy, FUNDC1 enabled LonP1 proteostasis, which in turn preserved complex V function and decreased ROS generation.

Introduction:   The purpose of this study was to develop a quantitative marker for use in prostate cancer magnetization transfer (MT) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies that is independent of radiofrequency (RF) saturation amplitude.  Methods:   Eighteen patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer were enrolled in this study. MTMRI images were acquired using four RF saturation amplitudes at 33 frequency offsets. ROIs were delineated for the peripheral zone (PZ), central gland (CG), and tumor. Z-spectral data were collected in each region and fit to a three-parameter equation. The three parameters are: the magnitude of the bulk water pool (Aw), the full width at half maximum of the water pool (Gw), and the magnitude of the bound pool (Ab), while, the slopes from the linear regressions of Gw and Ab on RF saturation amplitude (called kAb and kGw) were used as quantitative markers.  Results:   A pairwise statistically significant difference was found between the PZ and tumor regions for the two saturation amplitude-independent quantitative markers. No pairwise statistically significant differences were found between the CG and tumor regions for any quantitative markers.

According to the current international guidelines, adjuvant radiotherapy (ART) or a regular prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based follow-up with (early) salvage radiotherapy ((e)SRT) if needed is recommended in case of adverse pathological characteristics.Material and methods: Prospective data on consecutive robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) patients in Belgium from 2009 to 2016 were identified in the Belgian Robotic-Assisted-Laparoscopic-Prostatectomy (Be-RALP) database. Multivariable regression was used to evaluate patient- and facility-related factors associated with postoperative radiation treatment.Results: 2072 patients undergoing a RARP, suffering at least one of the following adverse pathological features, i.e., extracapsular extension (ECE), seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) or positive section margins (PSM), and with registered follow-up until 24 months were enrolled. After RARP, ART was applied to 9.1% and (e)SRT to 12.6% of the patients. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that patients were more likely to receive ART or (e)SRT if they were operated in a hospital with a RT department on-site (odds ratio, ART: 1.49 [1.07-2.07]; (e)SRT: 1.55 [1.16-2.06]). Furthermore, the presence of higher tumour category (T-category) and/or PSM on final pathology was associated with a higher chance of getting ART and (e)SRT (p < .01).Conclusion: Variations in ART and (e)SRT are not only driven by patient-related characteristics. In our nationwide cohort, the availability of a RT department on-site at the surgical centre was found to be an independent predictor for ART and (e)SRT, with a 1.5 times higher odds of receiving postoperative RT during the first 24 months after surgery.""","""['Cédric Draulans', 'Nancy Van Damme', 'Sofie Isebaert', 'Wouter Everaerts', 'Geert Silversmit', 'Steven Joniau', 'Gert De Meerleer', 'Elizabeth Van Eycken', 'Karin Haustermans;Be-RALP: The Belgian RALP consortium']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Adjuvant and salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Adjuvant versus early salvage radiotherapy: outcome of patients with prostate cancer treated with postoperative radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy.', 'Improved biochemical outcome with adjuvant radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer with poor pathologic features.', 'Adjuvant vs. salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy.', 'Adjuvant versus early Salvage radiation therapy for prostate cancer with adverse pathological features on radical prostatectomy-Do we finally have an answer?', 'Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in the treatment of patients with clinically high-risk localized and locally advanced prostate cancer: single surgeons functional and oncologic outcomes.']"""

Aim:   The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of the bone scan index by comparing the outcomes and factors according to response in Japanese patients treated with radium-223.  Methods and results:   Twenty patients receiving radium-223 were divided into two groups according to whether they did or did not achieve a bone scan index decrease of at least one point (beneficial and non-beneficial groups, respectively). The clinical characteristics at baseline and after three and six treatment cycles were compared using χ2 tests and Student's t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests, and survival was estimated and compared using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test, respectively. Fourteen (70%) and six patients (30%) were categorized into the beneficial and non-beneficial groups, respectively. Patients in the former group were significantly more likely to have a higher Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score and receive a greater number of radium-223 injections (P < 0.05). Furthermore, patients in the beneficial group had a significantly longer OS (P < 0.05). Regarding safety, one and three patients in the beneficial and non-beneficial groups, respectively, prematurely discontinued radium-223 because of an increased prostate-specific antigen level, decreased hemoglobin level, or femoral fracture.  Conclusion:   Radium-223 appears generally safe in this population. Patients with good bone scan index response have better performance status, receive more injections of radium-223, and achieve OS prolongation.

Treatment for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) includes androgen receptor signaling inhibitors such as abiraterone and enzalutamide, for which androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7) has emerged as a biomarker for primary resistance. Our study sought to analyze the potential economic impact of the use of AR-V7 detection as a treatment indicator in patients with mCRPC in three Latin American countries.  Materials and methods:   A hypothetical cost prediction model for the use of noninvasive circulating tumor cell-based AR-V7 testing as a treatment indicator for patients eligible for treatment with abiraterone/enzalutamide was conducted using available information on treatment and testing costs from Mexico, Argentina, and Colombia.  Results:   At an estimated prevalence of AR-V7 positivity of 20%, the use of upfront AR-V7 genetic testing resulted in annual net savings of $9,801,669.97, $6,390,055.75, and $3,096,780.91 in Mexico, Argentina, and Colombia, respectively. A direct relationship between AR-V7 positivity prevalence and net savings was found.  Conclusion:   The use of a noninvasive AR-V7 detection assay as a treatment indicator tool in patients eligible for treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide in Latin America could be a cost-effective approach for the management of these patients. Additional efforts are needed to accurately determine the incidence of castration-resistant prostate cancer cases and the prevalence of AR-V7 positivity in Latin America in order to predict the potential economic benefit of its clinical use.  Implications for practice:   In Latin America, prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in men, and the burden of this disease is expected to double in this region by 2030. Noninvasive detection of androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7) is being currently validated as a predictive biomarker for benefit with androgen receptor signaling inhibitor therapy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). This hypothetical cost-saving analysis shows that AR-V7 testing in peripheral blood of patients with CRPC eligible for treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide might represent a cost-effective strategy to select patients who will benefit from AR-axis-directed treatment in three Latin American countries.""","""['Rafael Adrián Pacheco-Orozco', 'Lorena Montealegre-Páez', 'Federico Cayol', 'Héctor Martínez-Gregorio', 'Javier Oliver', 'Cecilia Frecha', 'Felipe Vaca-Paniagua', 'Sandra Perdomo']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Oncologist""","""['Cost-Savings Analysis of AR-V7 Testing in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Eligible for Treatment With Abiraterone or Enzalutamide.', 'Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 and Efficacy of Taxane Chemotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'AR-V7 in Peripheral Whole Blood of Patients with Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Association with Treatment-specific Outcome Under Abiraterone and Enzalutamide.', 'AR-V7 Androgen Receptor Variant as a Predictor of Response to Androgen-receptor Targeting Agents Used to Treat Castration-refractory Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Development of AR-V7 as a putative treatment selection marker for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Emerging Role of Extracellular Vesicles in Prostate Cancer.']"""

The present study aimed to determine the risk factors for postoperative inguinal hernia (PIH) development after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RARP) for prostate cancer, and discuss whether sarcopenia could be used as a sensitive predictor of PIH.  Methods:   We reviewed the medical records of 147 patients who underwent RARP at our institution. The psoas muscle volume (PMV), as an indicator of sarcopenia, was quantified from computed tomography images using a 3-dimensional image analysis system. Multivariate cox regression analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of PIH, including pre- and peri-operative factors.  Results:   The mean PMV was 393 cm3, and the correlation coefficient between PMV and body mass index was 0.37 (p < 0.01). The PIH-free rate at 2 years postoperatively was 78.2% among all patients. The multivariate analysis revealed that a PMV < 350 cm3 was a significant risk factor for PIH (p = 0.03; hazard ratio 2.19). Body mass index, age, prostate volume, lymph node dissection, nerve sparing, rectus muscle thickness, and console time were not related to PIH development. The PIH-free rate at 2 years postoperatively was 83.4% and 68.9% in patients with a PMV ≥ 350 cm3 and < 350 cm3, respectively (p < 0.05).  Conclusions:   PIH occurred significantly more frequently in patients with a PMV < 350 cm3 than in patients with a PMV ≥ 350 cm3, and a low PMV was an independent risk factor for PIH. Thus, urologists should pay attention to the cumulative incidence of IH after RARP, especially in patients with a PMV < 350 cm3.""","""['Tatsuya Otaki', 'Masanori Hasegawa', 'Soichiro Yuzuriha', 'Izumi Hanada', 'Kentaro Nagao', 'Tatsuya Umemoto', 'Yuki Shimizu', 'Masayoshi Kawakami', 'Nobuyuki Nakajima', 'Hakushi Kim', 'Masahiro Nitta', 'Kazuya Hanai', 'Yoshiaki Kawamura', 'Sunao Shoji', 'Akira Miyajima']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Surg Endosc""","""['Laparoscopy/New Technology.', 'A low subcutaneous fat mass is a risk factor for the development of inguinal hernia after radical prostatectomy.', 'The cumulative incidence and risk factors of postoperative inguinal hernia in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Myosteatosis as a novel predictor of urinary incontinence after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Peritoneal closure and the processus vaginalis transection method to prevent inguinal hernia after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Inseparable interaction of the prostate and inguinal hernia.', 'Impact of tumor contact surface area on collecting system entry in robot-assisted partial nephrectomy: a retrospective analysis.', 'A systematic review of the association between parastomal hernia and sarcopenia.', ""The 'prostate-muscle index': a simple pelvic cavity measurement predicting estimated blood loss and console time in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy."", 'A low subcutaneous fat mass is a risk factor for the development of inguinal hernia after radical prostatectomy.', 'Utility of Robot-assisted Laparoscopic Transabdominal Preperitoneal Repair of Inguinal Hernia Following Robot-assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

We also wanted to establish the mean and second standard deviations (2SD) above and below the mean as criteria for abnormally narrow or expanded PZ thickness.  Methods:   Of the initial 1566 consecutive cohort referred for evaluation for carcinoma based on elevated PSA (prostate specific antibody) or DRE (digital rectal examination), 132 separate subjects with normal-sized prostates were selected for this study. Mean age was 58.2 years (15-82). Median serum PSA was 6.2 ng/mL (range 0.3-145). Most were asymptomatic for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Inclusion criteria in this study required technically adequate T2-weighted MRI and total prostatic volume (TPV) ≤ 25 cc. Exclusion criteria included post-prostatic surgical and radiation patients, patients having had medical management or minimally invasive therapy for BPH, those being treated for prostatitis. Patients with suspected tumor expanding or obscuring measurement boundaries were also not considered. Transition zone (TZ) and peripheral zone (PZ) volumes were determined using the prolate ellipsoid model. Posterolateral measurement of the PZ was obtained at the axial level of maximal transverse diameter of the prostate on a line drawn from the outer boundary of the TZ to the inner boundary of the external prostatic capsule (EPC). The data were normally distributed. Therefore, it was analyzed using the 2-sided student t-test and Pearson product correlation statistic.  Results:   Mean pooled (composite) measurement for the posterolateral PZ (PLPZ) was 10 mm (CI 9.5-10.5 mm) with SD of 2.87 mm. Means were statistically the same for the 2 observers (p = 0.75). Pearson correlation between the two observers was 0.63.  Conclusions:   In a prostate ≤ 25 cc volume , the posterolateral PZ should be no thicker than 15.8 mm and averages 10.0 mm when measured in the maximal axial plane on MRI.

Oxidative stress serves as a hallmark in developing prostate lesions, and an aggressive cancer phenotype activating mechanisms allowing cancer cells to adapt and survive. It is unclear how adaptation and survival are facilitated; however, literature across several organisms demonstrates that a reversible cellular growth arrest and the transcription factor, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB), contribute to cancer cell survival and therapeutic resistance under oxidative stress. We examined adaptability and survival to oxidative stress following nutrient deprivation in three prostate cancer models displaying varying degrees of tumorigenicity. We observed that reducing serum (starved) induced reactive oxygen species which provided an early oxidative stress environment and allowed cells to confer adaptability to increased oxidative stress (H2O2). Measurement of cell viability demonstrated a low death profile in stressed cells (starved + H2O2), while cell proliferation was stagnant. Quantitative measurement of apoptosis showed no significant cell death in stressed cells suggesting an adaptive mechanism to tolerate oxidative stress. Stressed cells also presented a quiescent phenotype, correlating with NF-κB nuclear translocation, suggesting a mechanism of tolerance. Our data suggests that nutrient deprivation primes prostate cancer cells for adaptability to oxidative stress and/or a general survival mechanism to anti-tumorigenic agents.""","""['ElShaddai Z White', 'Nakea M Pennant', 'Jada R Carter', 'Ohuod Hawsawi', 'Valerie Odero-Marah', 'Cimona V Hinton']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Therapeutic efficacy of Kangen-karyu against H2O2-induced premature senescence.', 'Docosahexaenoic acid selectively induces human prostate cancer cell sensitivity to oxidative stress through modulation of NF-κB.', 'Obovatol enhances docetaxel-induced prostate and colon cancer cell death through inactivation of nuclear transcription factor-kappaB.', 'Combination of ginsenoside Rg3 with docetaxel enhances the susceptibility of prostate cancer cells via inhibition of NF-kappaB.', 'Dealing with hunger: Metabolic stress responses in tumors.', 'Experimental assessment of robust reference genes for qRT-PCR in lung cancer studies.', 'Effects and Mechanisms of Action of Preussin, a Marine Fungal Metabolite, against the Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cell Line, MDA-MB-231, in 2D and 3D Cultures.', 'Comparative RNA-sequencing analysis of the prostate in a mouse model of benign prostatic hyperplasia with bladder outlet obstruction.', 'Quiescent Ovarian Cancer Cells Secrete Follistatin to Induce Chemotherapy Resistance in Surrounding Cells in Response to Chemotherapy.', 'HeLa Cervical Cancer Cells Are Maintained by Nephronophthisis 3-Associated Primary Cilium Formation via ROS-Induced ERK and HIF-1α Activation under Serum-Deprived Normoxic Condition.']"""

PCa usually progresses from an androgen-dependent to an androgen-independent stage, leading to an increase in the metastatic potential and an incurable malignancy. At present, the role of Naa10p in androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC) remains unclear. In this study, in silico and immunohistochemistry analyses showed that Naa10 transcripts or the Naa10p protein were more highly expressed in primary and metastatic PCa cancer tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues and non-metastatic cancer tissues, respectively. Knockdown and overexpression of Naa10p in AIPC cells (DU145 and PC-3M), respectively, led to decreased and increased cell clonogenic and invasive abilities in vitro as well as tumor growth and metastasis in AIPC xenografts. From the protease array screening, we identified a disintegrin and metalloprotease 9 (ADAM9) as a potential target of Naa10p, which was responsible for the Naa10p-induced invasion of AIPC cells. Naa10p can form a complex with ADAM9 to maintain ADAM9 protein stability and promote AIPC's invasive ability which were independent of its acetyltransferase activity. In contrast to the Naa10p-ADAM9 axis, ADAM9 exerted positive feedback regulation on Naa10p to modulate progression of AIPC in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, for the first time, our results reveal a novel cross-talk between Naa10p and ADAM9 in regulating the progression of AIPC.

Material and methods:   This clinical retrospective study included 103 patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. All patient data were obtained from the patient files and anesthesia follow-up forms. Demographic datas, intraoperative fluids, blood products requirement and blood gas parameters were recorded.  Results:   A total 15 of 103 patients data were lack, the remaining 88 patients were evaluated. Combination of crystalloid and colloid was used for intravenous fluid management. About 11% of patients required transfusion during surgery. The mean pH and pO2 values of the patients were observed to decrease whereas pCO2 and lactate values increased.  Discussion:   Radical Prostatectomy can be performed either using open technique as a traditional approach or laparoscopic or robot-assisted technique as a minimally invasive approach. Today, minimally invasive approaches have replaced traditional open prostatectomy. Anaesthesia management of these minimally invasive techniques is very different and challenging from open technique in many aspects.  Conclusion:   Although minimally invasive techniques have good surgical outcomes such as less blood loss, smaller surgical incision, and shorter hospitalization, these techniques bring new problems that anesthesiologists have to deal with. Increased RARP operations has led to the anesthesiologists more likely to encounter perioperative problems.

Background:   Prostatic carcinoma is a multifactorial complex disorder that exhibits an increased propensity to develop bone metastasis. An interplay of inflammatory and bone remodeling parameters promotes the formation of pre-metastatic niches in bones of patients, which could render them more vulnerable to skeletal disabilities.  Objective:   To evaluate the multi-dynamic inter-relationship of circulating variables in prostate cancer patients experiencing osteo-metastasis.  Materials and methods:   Fifty-seven (n=57) men with clinically confirmed prostate cancer, fifty-nine (n=59) with skeletal metastases, and one hundred (n=100) healthy subjects i.e., men aging from 53-84 years with no clinical evidence of prostate were recruited from the Jinnah Hospital Lahore, Pakistan. Informed consent was obtained, and a venous blood sample was drawn and stored at -70oC until assayed. Levels of variables were evaluated using appropriate methods. Levels of Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs), Osteopontin (OPN), TGH- β, and sRANKL were estimated by the ELISA method. Each sample was suspended and the given protocol was employed. ELISA readings were obtained for the estimation of all variables.  Results:   Highly significant (P˂0.05) differential expression of oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines, and bone remodeling variables were observed in localized and osteo-metastatic CA prostate patients. A strong positive correlation was revealed among OPN, sRANKL, MMP-7, MMP-9, PSA, and TGF-β (OPN vs. MMP-7, r=0.698* and OPN vs. MMP-9, r=0.765**, OPN vs. RANKL, =0.856*, sRANKL vs. MMP-9, r=0.825**, TGF- β vs. RANKL, r=0.868* and PSA vs. TGF- β, r=0.752*); lower levels of OPG were estimated in metastasized patients, showing that both osteolytic and osteoblastic phases of bone remodeling occur simultaneously.  Conclusion:   The altered oxidative and inflammatory responses endorse Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) increased activity, RANKL/OPG imbalance, and enhanced bone matrix proteins turnover, which can foster the process of osteo-metastasis. The perturbed RANKL/OPG drift and enhanced PSA levels are associated with increased TGF-β activity to aggravate Epithelial Mesenchymal transition (EM) and osteo-tropism of prostate cancer. Thus, designing novel targets of these major variables can minimize the incidence of prostate cancer patients.""","""['Muhammad A B Ashraf', 'Ayesha Zahid', 'Shazia Ashraf', 'Sulayman Waquar', 'Saima Iqbal', 'Arif Malik']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Anticancer Agents Med Chem""","""['Abnormal bone remodeling process is due to an imbalance in the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL)/osteoprotegerin (OPG) axis in patients with solid tumors metastatic to the skeleton.', 'Potential role of the OPG/RANK/RANKL axis in prostate cancer invasion and bone metastasis.', 'Serum receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) levels predict biochemical recurrence in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'The role of osteoclastic activity in prostate cancer skeletal metastases.', 'Osteomimetic properties of prostate cancer cells: a hypothesis supporting the predilection of prostate cancer metastasis and growth in the bone environment.', 'Role of the Hypoxic-Secretome in Seed and Soil Metastatic Preparation.']"""

We evaluated whether increased fat volume, normalized to prostate size, is associated with decreased risk of disease progression.  Materials and methods:   Patients enrolled on a prospective active surveillance trial for at least 6 months who had magnetic resonance imaging within 2 years of enrollment were eligible. The surveillance protocol included a standardized followup regimen consisting of biennial prostate specific antigen and examination and yearly biopsy. Clinicopathological characteristics were collected at baseline. Three fat measurements were taken using prostate magnetic resonance imaging, including subcutaneous, linear periprostatic (pubic symphysis to prostate) and volumetrically defined periprostatic. Progression was defined as increase in Gleason grade group. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate fat volumes normalized by prostate size (stratified into tertiles).  Results:   A total of 175 patients were included in the study. Average age was 62.5 years (SD 7.4) and average prostate specific antigen was 5.4 ng/dl (SD 3.9). Median followup was 42 months (IQR 18-60) and 50 patients (28.6%) had progression. Compared to the lowest tertile, the highest tertile of volumetric periprostatic fat measurement (HR 2.63, 95% CI 1.23-5.60, p=0.01) and linear periprostatic fat measurement (HR 2.30, 95% CI 1.01-5.22, p=0.05) were associated with worsened progression-free survival, while subcutaneous fat measurement (p=0.97) was not. Importantly, the model did not substantively change when accounting for patient body mass index and other factors.

Purpose:   To compare multiple aMRI protocols for predicting pathological stage ≥T3 (≥pT3) prostate cancer (PCa).  Material and methods:   One hundred and eight men undergoing staging mpMRI before radical prostatectomy (RP) were retrospectively evaluated. 3.0-T imaging was performed with a 32-channel surface coil and a protocol including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), transverse T2-weighted (tT2W) imaging, coronal T2W (cT2W) imaging, sagittal T2W (sT2) imaging, and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging. Two readers independently assessed whether any MRI observation showed stage ≥T3 on each sequence (reading order: DWI, cT2W, tT2W, sT2W, DCE). Final stage was assessed by matching readers' assignments to pathology, and combining them into eight protocols: DWI + tT2W, DWI + cT2W + tT2W, DWI + tT2W + sT2W, DWI + cT2W + tT2W + sT2W, DWI + tT2W + DCE, DWI + cT2W + tT2W + DCE, DWI + tT2W + sT2W + DCE, and mpMRI. Diagnostic accuracy and inter-reader agreement for aMRI protocols were calculated.  Results:   Prevalence of ≥pT3 PCa was 31.5%. Sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of aMRI protocols were comparable to mpMRI for R1. Sensitivity was 74.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 64.8-72.0) to 77.1% (95% CI 67.9-84.4), and NPV 86.8% (95% CI 78.6-92.3) to 88.1% (95% CI 80.1-93.3). All accuracy measures of the various aMRI protocols were similar to mpMRI also for R2, albeit all slightly lower compared to R1. On a per-protocol basis, there was substantial inter-reader agreement in predicting stage ≥pT3 (k 0.63-0.67).

We conducted linear and non-linear dose-response meta-analyses of cohort studies on alcohol consumption and PCa risk by types of alcohol (total, wine, beer, and liquor) and PCa (non-aggressive and aggressive). Pubmed and Embase were searched through April 2020 to identify relevant studies. Summary relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated using a random-effects model. For non-aggressive PCa, by alcohol type, the risk increased linearly with liquor (RR per 14 g/day intake (alcohol content in standard drink) being 1.04 (95% CI = 1.02-1.06, I2 = 0%, three studies) and non-linearly with beer (Pnon-linearity = 0.045, four studies), with increased risk observed in the lower range (RR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.01-1.05; 14 g/day), with 1.05 (95% CI = 1.01-1.08) at 28 g/day. Wine was not significantly associated with the risk of non-aggressive PCa. For aggressive PCa, a non-linear relationship of diverse shapes was indicated for all types of alcohol in the sensitivity analysis. Compared to non-drinking, a significant positive association was more apparent at lower dose for liquor (RR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.04-1.20 at 14 g/day; RR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.03-1.31 at 28 g/day; Pnon-linearity = 0.005, three studies) but at higher doses for wine (RR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.90-1.16 at 28 g/day, RR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.08-1.67 at 56 g/day; Pnon-linearity = 0.01, four studies). In contrast, decreased risks were indicated at lower doses of beer (RR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.79-0.92 at 14 g/day; RR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.70-0.90 at 28 g/day, Pnon-linearity < 0.001, four studies).

Contrasting with other cancer types, glucose utilization is not increased in prostate carcinoma cells as they employ different metabolic adaptations involving mitochondria as a source of energy and intermediates required for rapid cell growth. In this regard, prostate cancer cells were associated with higher activity of mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mGPDH), the key rate limiting component of the glycerophosphate shuttle, which connects mitochondrial and cytosolic processes and plays significant role in cellular bioenergetics. Our research focused on the role of mGPDH biogenesis and regulation in prostate cancer compared to healthy cells. We show that the 42 amino acid presequence is cleaved from N-terminus during mGPDH biogenesis. Only the processed form is part of the mGPDH dimer that is the prominent functional enzyme entity. We demonstrate that mGPDH overexpression enhances the wound healing ability in prostate cancer cells.

Trends and variation in the definitive management of prostate cancer in Ontario, Canada""","""Background and purpose:   Declining prostate brachytherapy utilization has been reported in several studies, despite strong evidence for efficacy and safety compared to alternatives. We sought to evaluate contemporary trends in brachytherapy, external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and prostatectomy utilization in a publicly funded healthcare system.  Materials and methods:   Men with localized prostate cancer diagnosed and treated between 2006 and 2017 in Ontario, Canada were identified using administrative data. Men received EBRT, brachytherapy (monotherapy or boost) or prostatectomy as initial definitive management. Multivariable logistic regression evaluated patient-, tumour-, and provider-factors on treatment utilization.  Results:   61,288 men were included. On multivariable regression, the odds of receiving brachytherapy boost increased 24% per year (odds ratio [OR]:1.24, 95% CI 1.22-1.26, p < 0.01), brachytherapy monotherapy increased 3% per year (OR:1.03, 95% CI:1.02-1.04, p < 0.01), and prostatectomy declined by 6% per year (OR:0.94, 95% CI 0.93-0.95, p < 0.01). Treatment year was not significant on multivariable modelling of EBRT. In a separate multivariable model limited to those who received radiotherapy, if the first radiation oncologist seen performed brachytherapy, the OR of receiving brachytherapy monotherapy over EBRT was 5.66 (95% CI: 5.11-6.26, p < 0.01) and 2.88 (95% CI: 2.60-3.19, p < 0.01) for brachytherapy boost over EBRT alone. Substantial geographic, provider and patient variation in treatment receipt was observed.  Conclusion:   We found increasing brachytherapy utilization, largely driven by increasing utilization of brachytherapy boost. To our knowledge, this is the first report of increasing brachytherapy use in the era of dose escalated EBRT.""","""['Mark T Corkum', 'Gerard Morton', 'Alexander V Louie', 'Glenn S Bauman', 'Lucas C Mendez', 'Joseph Chin', ""David P D'Souza"", 'Robert E Dinniwell', 'Vikram M Velker', 'Refik Saskin', 'Andrew Warner', 'George B Rodrigues']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Challenges influencing the utilization of prostate brachytherapy in the United States.', 'Brachytherapy Boost Utilization and Survival in Unfavorable-risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Variations in patterns of concurrent androgen deprivation therapy use based on dose escalation with external beam radiotherapy vs. brachytherapy boost for prostate cancer.', 'Brachytherapy boost for prostate cancer: Trends in care and survival outcomes.', 'American Brachytherapy Society Task Group Report: Combination of brachytherapy and external beam radiation for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'A Brief Review of Low-Dose Rate (LDR) and High-Dose Rate (HDR) Brachytherapy Boost for High-Risk Prostate.', 'Real-world utilisation of brachytherapy boost and patient-reported functional outcomes in men who had external beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer in Australia.', 'The value of brachytherapy in the age of advanced external beam radiotherapy: a\xa0review of the literature in terms of dosimetry.', 'Characterizing Surgical and Radiotherapy Outcomes in Non-metastatic High-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'The Case for Brachytherapy: Why It Deserves a Renaissance.']"""

Overexpression of KIFC1 in prostate cancer (PCa) cells showed resistance to docetaxel (DTX). The present study revealed that small KIFC1 inhibitor AZ82 suppresed the transcription and translation of KIFC1 significantly in PCa cells. AZ82 inhibited the KIFC1 expression both in the cytoplasm and nucleus of PCa cells. Inhibition of KIFC1 by AZ82 caused multipolar mitosis in PCa cells via de-clustering the amplified centrosomes and decreased the rate of cancer cell growth and proliferation. Moreover, depletion of KIFC1 reduced cells entering the cell cycle and caused PCa cells death through apoptosis by increasing the expression of Bax and Cytochrome C. Thereby, KIFC1 silencing and inhibition decreased the PCa cells survival by inducing multipolar mitosis as well as apoptosis, suggesting inhibition of KIFC1 using AZ82 might be a strategy to treat PCa by controlling the cancer cell proliferation.""","""['Anzana Parvin', 'Shuang-Li Hao', 'Fu-Qing Tan', 'Wan-Xi Yang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Gene""","""['Corrigendum to ""Inhibition of kinesin motor protein KIFC1 by AZ82 induces multipolar mitosis and apoptosis in prostate cancer cell"" Gene 760 (2020) 144989.', 'Discovery and mechanistic study of a small molecule inhibitor for motor protein KIFC1.', 'KIFC1: a promising chemotherapy target for cancer treatment?', 'Structural basis of small molecule ATPase inhibition of a human mitotic kinesin motor protein.', 'A centrosome clustering protein, KIFC1, predicts aggressive disease course in serous ovarian adenocarcinomas.', 'Computational benchmarking of putative KIFC1 inhibitors.', 'Upregulating KTN1 promotes Hepatocellular Carcinoma progression.']"""

The aim of this study was to compare patient-reported outcomes after IMRT to the prostate only (PO-IMRT) versus the prostate and pelvic lymph nodes (PPLN-IMRT).  Methods and materials:   Patients who received a diagnosis of high-risk or locally advanced prostate cancer in the English National Health Service between April 2014 and September 2016 who were treated with IMRT were mailed a questionnaire at least 18 months after diagnosis. Patient-reported urinary, sexual, bowel, and hormonal functional domains on a scale from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better outcomes, and generic health-related quality of life were collected using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite 26-item version and EQ-5D-5L. We used linear regression to compare PPLN-IMRT versus PO-IMRT with adjustment for patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics.  Results:   Of the 7017 men who received a questionnaire, 5468 (77.9%) responded; 4196 (76.7%) had received PO-IMRT and 1272 (23.3%) PPLN-IMRT. Adjusted differences in the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite 26-item version domain scores were smaller than 1 (P always >.2), except for sexual function, with men who had PPNL-IMRT reporting a lower mean score (adjusted difference, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.9-3.7; P = .002). This did not represent a clinically relevant difference. There was no significant difference in health-related quality of life (P = .5).

We used 416 single-nucleotide polymorphisms robustly associated with serum IGF-1 levels to assess the potential causal associations between this hormone and site-specific cancers through Mendelian randomization. Summary-level genetic association estimates for prostate, breast, ovarian, and lung cancer were obtained from large-scale consortia including individuals of European-descent. Furthermore, we estimated genetic associations with 14 site-specific cancers in European-descent individuals in UK Biobank. Supplementary analyses were conducted for six site-specific cancers using summary-level data from the BioBank Japan Project. Genetically predicted serum IGF-1 levels were associated with colorectal cancer. The odds ratio (OR) per standard deviation increase of IGF-1 levels was 1.11 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.22; P = .03) in UK Biobank and 1.22 (95% CI 1.09-1.36; P = 3.9 × 10-4 ) in the BioBank Japan Project.

Methods:   We used the TriNetX platform to analyze 20 health care institutions that have relevant, up-to-date encounter data. Using this COVID and Cancer Research Network (CCRN), we compared cancer cohorts identified by querying encounter data pre-COVID (January 2019-April 2019) and current (January 2020-April 2020). Cohorts were generated for all patients with neoplasms (malignant, benign, in situ, and of unspecified behavior), with new incidence neoplasms (first encounter), with exclusively malignant neoplasms, and with new incidence malignant neoplasms. Data from a UK institution were similarly analyzed. Additional analyses were performed on patients with selected cancers, as well as on those having had cancer screening.  Results:   Clear trends were identified that suggest a significant decline in all current cohorts explored, with April 2020 displaying the largest decrease in the number of patients with cancer having encounters. Of the cancer types analyzed, lung, colorectal, and hematologic cancer cohorts exhibited smaller decreases in size in April 2020 versus 2019 (-39.1%, -39.9%, -39.1%, respectively) compared with cohort size decreases for breast cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma (-47.7%, -49.1%, -51.8%, respectively). In addition, cancer screenings declined drastically, with breast cancer screenings dropping by -89.2% and colorectal cancer screenings by -84.5%.  Conclusion:   Trends seen in the CCRN clearly suggest a significant decrease in all cancer-related patient encounters as a result of the pandemic. The steep decreases in cancer screening and patients with a new incidence of cancer suggest the possibility of a future increase in patients with later-stage cancer being seen initially as well as an increased demand for cancer screening procedures as delayed tests are rescheduled.""","""['Jack W London', 'Elnara Fazio-Eynullayeva', 'Matvey B Palchuk', 'Peter Sankey', 'Christopher McNair']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""JCO Clin Cancer Inform""","""['COVID-19 and Cancer: Unintended Consequences.', 'Evolving Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Cancer-Related Encounters.', 'Changes in the Number of US Patients With Newly Identified Cancer Before and During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic.', 'Incidence of Stress Cardiomyopathy During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic.', 'Cancer surgery sustainability in the light of COVID-19 pandemic.', 'Early observations from the initial impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic on surgical services in the United Kingdom: a comprehensive review.', 'The impact of COVID-19 on national program of colorectal cancer screening in Tehran, Iran: a multicenter study.', 'The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Breast and Cervical Cancer Screening: A Systematic Review.', 'Clinical outcomes of obstructive colorectal cancer patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.', ""The Effect of Fear of COVID-19 on Women's Attitudes toward Cancer Screening and Healthy Lifestyle Behaviors: A Cross-Sectional Study."", 'Changes in colorectal cancer treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan: Interrupted time-series analysis using the National Database of Japan.']"""

The issue will be addressed in this study using circRNA Cyclin B2 (circ_CCNB2) as an object. Materials and Methods: All RNA and protein levels were severally examined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Colony formation assay and flow cytometry were implemented for detecting cell colony capacity and apoptotic cells, respectively. Cellular migration and invasion abilities were evaluated by transwell assay. The combination between potential target molecules was analyzed by dual-luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays. The effect of circ_CCNB2 on PCa radiosensitivity in vivo was explored using xenograft models in mice. Results: Circ_CCNB2 was upregulated in irradiation-resistant PCa tissues and cells. Circ_CCNB2 knockdown had promoted effect on the radiosensitivity of irradiation-resistant PCa cells by inhibiting autophagy. Besides, circ_CCNB2 could directly sponge miR-30b-5p, and the promotion of circ_CCNB2 knockdown on PCa radiosensitivity was achieved by elevating miR-30b-5p. MiR-30b-5p enhanced the radiosensitivity of irradiation-resistant PCa cells through repressing the expression of its target kinesin family member 18A (KIF18A). Furthermore, circ_CCNB2 regulated the KIF18A level through targeting miR-30b-5p. Circ_CCNB2 downregulation facilitated PCa radiosensitivity in vivo through inhibiting autophagy by miR-30b-5p/KIF18A. Conclusions: In this study, knockdown of circ_CCNB2 was shown to promote PCa radiosensitivity through autophagy repression by miR-30b-5p/KIF18A axis, developing a molecular resistance mechanism of PCa radiotherapy and a feasible strategy to increase radiosensitivity.""","""['Fangzhen Cai', 'Jianwei Li', 'Jianyu Zhang', 'Sihuai Huang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Biother Radiopharm""","""['Circ_0044516 Enriches the Level of SARM1 as a miR-330-5p Sponge to Regulate Cell Malignant Behaviors and Tumorigenesis of Prostate Cancer.', 'Circ_0062020 Knockdown Strengthens the Radiosensitivity of Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Circular RNA LPAR3 targets JPT1 via microRNA-513b-5p to facilitate glycolytic activation but repress prostate cancer radiosensitivity.', 'Knockdown of circ-ADAM9 inhibits malignant phenotype and enhances radiosensitivity in breast cancer cells via acting as a\xa0sponge for miR-383-5p.', 'Circ_0001686 knockdown suppresses tumorigenesis and enhances radiosensitivity in esophagus cancer through regulating miR-876-5p/SPIN1 axis.', 'CircRNAs in Tumor Radioresistance.', 'Circular RNA-regulated autophagy is involved in cancer progression.', 'Mechanism and Function of Circular RNA in Regulating Solid Tumor Radiosensitivity.', 'Integrated analysis of mRNA-single nucleotide polymorphism-microRNA interaction network to identify biomarkers associated with prostate cancer.', 'CircRNAs in Malignant Tumor Radiation: The New Frontier as Radiotherapy Biomarkers.']"""

We report here the heterologous expression of polyhistidine-tagged, codon-optimized human 5αR1 and 5αR2 cDNAs in Escherichia coli. A combination of the nonionic detergents Triton X-100 and Nonidet P-40 enabled solubilization of these extremely hydrophobic integral membrane proteins and facilitated purification with affinity and cation-exchange chromatography methods. For functional reconstitution, we incorporated the purified isoenzymes into Triton X-100-saturated dioleoylphosphatidylcholine liposomes and removed excess detergent with polystyrene beads. Kinetic studies indicated that the 2 isozymes differ in biochemical properties, with 5αR2 having a lower apparent Km for testosterone, androstenedione, progesterone, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone than 5αR1; however, 5αR1 had a greater capacity for steroid conversion, as reflected by a higher Vmax than 5αR2. Both enzymes preferred progesterone as substrate over other steroids, and the catalytic efficiency of purified reconstituted 5αR2 exhibited a sharp pH optimum at pH 5. Intriguingly, we found that the prostate-cancer drug-metabolite 3-keto-∆ 4-abiraterone is metabolized by 5αR1 but not 5αR2, which may serve as a structural basis for isoform selectivity and inhibitor design. The functional characterization results with the purified reconstituted isoenzymes paralleled trends obtained with HEK-293 cell lines stably expressing native 5αR1 and 5αR2. Access to purified human 5αR1 and 5αR2 will advance studies of these important enzymes and might help to clarify their contributions to steroid anabolism and catabolism.""","""['Hwei-Ming Peng', 'Juan Valentín-Goyco', 'Sang-Choul Im', 'Bing Han', 'Jiayan Liu', 'Jie Qiao', 'Richard J Auchus']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Endocrinology""","""['Enzyme assay for 5alpha-reductase type 2 activity in the presence of 5alpha-reductase type 1 activity in rat testis.', '5alpha-reductase type 1 immunostaining is enhanced in some prostate cancers compared with benign prostatic hyperplasia epithelium.', '5alpha-reductase isoenzymes 1 and 2 in the rat testis during postnatal development.', 'The role of 5-reduction in physiology and metabolic disease: evidence from cellular, pre-clinical and human studies.', 'Type 1 and type 2 5alpha-reductase expression in the development and progression of prostate cancer.', 'Osteoblasts Generate Testosterone From DHEA and Activate Androgen Signaling in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Structure of human steroid 5α-reductase 2 with the anti-androgen drug finasteride.']"""

Materials and methods:   This study included 55 PCa patients who had 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT performed for staging. According to metastatic pattern, patients were divided into 3 groups as non-metastatic (N0M0), those with isolated pelvic lymph node metastasis (N1M0) and with distant metastasis (M1). The correlations between the primary tumor PSMA expression parameters such as maximum standardize uptake value (SUVmax), SUVmean, PSMA-TV (PSMA receptor expressing tumour volume), and TL-PSMA (total lesion PSMA receptor expression) on 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT imaging and metastatic patterns were investigated.  Results:   There were 21, 9 and 25 patients in the N0M0, N1M0 and M1 groups, respectively. The PSMA-TV and TL-PSMA values were significantly higher in the N1M0 and the M1 patient groups compared to the N0M0 group, but there was no significant difference between the N1M0 and M1 groups. The primary tumor SUVmax and SUVmean values were not significantly different between the three groups. The optimal PSMA-TV cut-off value for metastasis was >8.07cm3 (AUC 0.86) with sensitivity of 76.5% and specificity 85.7%.

PSMA ligand imaging has been shown to be valuable in predicting EPE when performed on a hybrid PET/MRI scanner; however, the majority of PSMA PET imaging is performed using PSMA-PET. To our knowledge, there are no established PET/CT criteria for assessing EPE. In this study, we aim to provide a reproducible method for evaluating EPE on PSMA-PET/CT imaging and assess its utility compared with MRI.  Methods:   Imaging findings and histopathology were reviewed for 100 consecutive patients who underwent a radical prostatectomy after imaging with MRI and 18F-DCFPyL PSMA-PET/CT.  Results:   A broad tumour-capsule interface measured using a standardised technique on fused PSMA-PET/CT imaging is associated with a higher risk for established EPE (P < 0.001). In our cohort, applying the criteria of tumour-capsule contact ≥ 10 mm measured on PET/CT was as sensitive as applying PI-RADS version 2 criteria to mpMRI imaging for predicting EPE (74% and 79%, respectively, P = 0.11) and had superior specificity (86% and 61%, respectively, P = 0.035). 93% of MRI-occult lesions were visualised on PSMA-PET/CT. Applying the proposed PET/CT criteria for EPE to this subgroup of 14 patients yielded a sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 92%.  Conclusion:   Our results suggest that tumour-capsule interface measured on fused F18-DCFPyL PSMA-PET/CT imaging is comparable to MRI criteria for predicting the presence of EPE. Applying PET/CT criteria may be of particular benefit in predicting EPE in patients with MRI-occult prostate cancer.""","""['Damian Brauchli', 'Dalveer Singh', 'Charles Chabert', 'Arjuna Somasundaram', 'Leesa Collie']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol""","""['Histological comparison between predictive value of preoperative 3-T multiparametric MRI and 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan for pathological outcomes at radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection for prostate cancer.', 'Head-to-Head Comparison of 18F-PSMA-1007 Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography and Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Whole-mount Histopathology as Reference in Localisation and Staging of Primary Prostate Cancer.', 'Head-to-Head Comparison of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and mpMRI with a Histopathology Gold Standard in the Detection, Intraprostatic Localization, and Determination of Local Extension of Primary Prostate Cancer: Results from a Prospective Single-Center Imaging Trial.', 'Prostate Cancer: Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron-emission Tomography/Computed Tomography or Positron-emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Staging.', '18FDCFPyL PET/CT for Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) fusion imaging in prostate cancer: PET-CT vs PET-MRI.']"""

What are the characteristics of the NK cell response following acute moderate-intensity aerobic exercise in prostate cancer survivors and is there a relationship between stress hormones and NK cell mobilization? What is the main finding and its importance? NK cell numbers and proportions changed similarly between prostate cancer survivors and controls following acute exercise. Consecutive training sessions can likely be used without adverse effects on the immune system during prostate cancer treatment.  Abstract:   Prostate cancer treatment affects multiple physiological systems, although the immune response during exercise has been minimally investigated. The objective was to characterize the natural killer (NK) cell response following acute exercise in prostate cancer survivors. Prostate cancer survivors on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and those without (PCa) along with non-cancer controls (CON) completed a moderate intensity cycling bout. NK cells were phenotyped before and 0, 2 and 24 h after acute exercise using flow cytometry. CD56 total NK cell frequency increased by 6.2% at 0 h (P < 0.001) and decreased by 2.5% at 2 h (P < 0.01) with similar findings in CD56dim cells. NK cell counts also exhibited a biphasic response. Independent of exercise, ADT had intracellular interferon γ (IFNγ) expression that was nearly twofold higher than CON (P < 0.01). PCa perforin expression was reduced by 11.4% (P < 0.05), suggesting these cells may be more prone to degranulation. CD57- NK cells demonstrated increased perforin and IFNγ frequencies after exercise with no change within the CD57+ populations. All NK and leukocyte populations returned to baseline by 24 h. NK cell mobilization and egress with acute exercise appear normal, as cell counts and frequencies in prostate cancer survivors change similarly to CON. However, lower perforin proportions (PCa) and higher IFNγ expression (ADT) may alter NK cytotoxicity and require further investigation. The return of NK cell proportions to resting levels overnight suggests that consecutive training sessions can be used without adverse effects on the immune system during prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Erik D Hanson', 'Samy Sakkal', 'Shadney Que', 'Eunhan Cho', 'Guillaume Spielmann', 'Elif Kadife', 'John A Violet', 'Claudio L Battaglini', 'Lee Stoner', 'David B Bartlett', 'Glenn K McConell', 'Alan Hayes']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Exp Physiol""","""['NK cells dysfunction in systemic lupus erythematosus: relation to disease activity.', 'Systemic hypoxia affects exercise-mediated antitumor cytotoxicity of natural killer cells.', 'Natural killer cell subset count and antigen-stimulated activation in response to exhaustive running following adaptation to a ketogenic diet.', 'Human natural killer cell subsets and acute exercise: a brief review.', 'The role of exercise in the management of adverse effects of androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a rapid review.', 'The influence of lifestyle changes (diet, exercise and stress reduction) on prostate cancer tumour biology and patient outcomes: A systematic review.', 'Acute exercise induces distinct quantitative and phenotypical T cell profiles in men with prostate cancer.', 'Impact of maximal exercise on immune cell mobilization and bioenergetics.', 'Behavioral factors to modulate immunotherapy efficacy in cancer.', 'Is There a Role for Exercise When Treating Patients with Cancer with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors?

The study was designed to evaluate the long-term outcomes of the two methods.  Materials and methods:   A prospective, non-randomized study was conceived. The demographics and operative outcomes of patients with prostate cancer undergoing RALP from September 2016 to January 2017 at our center were included.  Results:   A total of eighty-six patients were enrolled. Thirty-seven patients underwent EP-RALP, and forty-nine patients received TP-RALP. No significant difference was observed in age, body mass index, pathological T stage, pathological N stage, M stage, 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology group, comorbidities or American Society of Anesthesiologists score. A lower preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was detected in the EP-RALP group. No significant differences were observed in overall operation time, robotic console time, surgical margin status, postoperative hospitalization time, drop of hemoglobin and complications, except that patients with EP-RALP had a shorter time to first exsufflation after surgery than those with TP-RALP (41.35 vs. 51.80 h, P < .001). Postoperative PSA until 12 months was deemed comparable in both groups. Complete continence until 12 months after surgery was desirable but not significantly different between two groups (75.0% in EP- RALP vs. 86.7%. in TP-RALP, P = .179).  Conclusion:   The long-term outcomes of EP-RALP were analogous to those of TP-RALP. Therefore, EP-RALP is an alternative approach for patients with localized prostate cancer.""","""['Yubo Yang', 'Zhenhua Liu', 'Yaochuan Guo', 'Xiang Li', 'Liangren Liu', 'Xiaoming Wang', 'Yunjin Bai', 'Qiang Wei', 'Ping Han']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Urol J""","""['Transperitoneal versus extraperitoneal robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: A prospective single surgeon randomized comparative study.', ""Comparison of oncological results, functional outcomes, and complications for transperitoneal versus extraperitoneal robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a single surgeon's experience."", 'Comparisons of the perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes after robot-assisted versus pure extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Transperitoneal versus extraperitoneal robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Transperitoneal versus extraperitoneal approach to laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: an assessment of 156 cases.', 'Comparison of Perioperative, Functional, and Oncological Outcomes of Transperitoneal and Extraperitoneal Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Robotic-assisted versus laparoscopic approach of Bai-Jiang-style vagus nerve-preserving splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection.', 'A comparison of the da Vinci Xi vs. da Vinci Si surgical systems for radical prostatectomy.']"""

Benth""","""Background and objectives: Kigelia africana is a medicinal plant growing naturally in many parts of Africa. In Kenya, a water concoction of the plant is used to treat breast and prostate cancers. Laboratory data on its anti-cancer activity and active principles is limited, hence no scientific rationale for its medicinal use. This study reports on in-vitro toxic activities of dichloromethane and methanol extracts of the plant against human breast cancer cells and phytochemical screening of the two extracts.  Methodology:   Plant extracts were obtained by sequential solvent extraction of dry plant material (stem bark) using analytical grade dichloromethane: methanol (1:1) and methanol (Sigma Aldrich). In-vitro anti-cancer activities of the extracts were determined using the suphorhodamine (SRB) assay against a human breast cancer cell line (HCC 1937). Preliminary Thin layer chromatography of plant extracts was done using POLYGRAM® SIL G/UV254 plates (Merck) to establish presence of different classes of secondary metabolites.  Results: In-vitro cytotoxic activities of the two extracts were significantly different (P = 0.05). The methanol extract exhibited higher activity (IC50 = 26.02 μg/ml) compared to that of dichloromethane: methanol (1:1) (IC50 = 55.01 μg/ml). Phyto-chemical screening of the two extracts revealed the presence of terpenoids, phenols, steroids and flavonoids.  Conclusion:   The high in-vitro anti-cancer activities of solvent extracts of Kigelia africana justify its use in traditional medicine to manage breast cancer. Phytochemical analysis of the extracts reveal similar profiles hence the differences in their anti-cancer activities can be attributed to quantitative variations of various classes of secondary metabolites.""","""['Justus Wambua Mukavi', 'Philip Wafula Mayeku', 'Justin Muhoro Nyaga', 'Sarah Naulikha Kituyi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Heliyon""","""['Evaluation of Phytochemicals, Antioxidants, Trace Elements in Kigelia africana Fruit Extracts and Chemical Profiling Analysis Using UHPLC-qTOF-MS2 Spectrometry.', 'In vitro and in vivo studies on anti-malarial activity of Commiphora africana and Dichrostachys cinerea used by the Maasai in Arusha region, Tanzania.', 'Efficacy of Kigelia africana Lam.

These studies used their own risk criteria: CHAARTED trial defines high- and low-volume diseases and LATITUDE trial targeting a high-risk disease. The present study explored whether or not the CHAARTED and LATITUDE criteria were useful for predicting the outcome in Japanese bone mHNPC patients, including elderly patients (≥70 years).  Methods:   A total of 532 mHNPC patients diagnosed from 2004 to 2014 in multithird referral cancer centers were enrolled in this study. All patients had bone metastasis and received combined androgen blockade treatment as an initial hormonal therapy.  Results:   The number of patients with CHAARTED low-volume and high-volume diseases was 178 (33.5%) and 354 (66.5%), respectively. On the contrary, the number of patients with LATITUDE low-risk and high-risk diseases was 157 (29.5%) and 375 (70.5%), respectively. A total of 307 (57.7%) patients were defined as having both CHAARTED high-volume and LATITUDE high-risk disease. The median castration-resistant prostate cancer- (CRPC-) free survival was 12.5 months for the CHAARTED high volume, 56.9 months for the CHAARTED low volume, 13.6 months for the LATITUDE high risk, and 37.3 months for the LATITUDE low risk, respectively. The OS was 50.1 months in patients with CHAARTED high-volume disease, 95.1 months in patients with CHAARTED low-volume disease, 54.0 months in patients with LATITUDE high-risk disease, and 92.7 months in patients with LATITUDE low-risk disease, respectively. This trend was also observed in elderly (≥70 years old) patients.

Furthermore, automated planning approaches such as multicriteria optimization (MCO) are still limited to the automatic generation of a single treatment plan. This study aims to quantify planning efficiency gains when using a graphics processing unit-based MCO (gMCO) algorithm combined with a novel graphical user interface (gMCO-GUI) that integrates efficient automated and interactive plan navigation tools.  Methods and materials:   The gMCO algorithm was used to generate 1000 Pareto optimal plans per case for 379 prostate cases. gMCO-GUI was developed to allow plan navigation through all plans. gMCO-GUI integrates interactive parameter selection tools directly with the optimization algorithm to allow plan navigation. The quality of each plan was evaluated based on the Radiation Treatment Oncology Group 0924 protocol and a more stringent institutional protocol (INSTp). gMCO-GUI allows real-time time display of the dose-volume histogram indices, the dose-volume histogram curves, and the isodose lines during the plan navigation.  Results:   Over the 379 cases, the fraction of Radiation Treatment Oncology Group 0924 protocol valid plans with target coverage greater than 95% was 90.8%, compared with 66.0% for clinical plans. The fraction of INSTp valid plans with target coverage greater than 95% was 81.8%, compared with 62.3% for clinical plans. The average time to compute 1000 deliverable plans with gMCO was 12.5 s, including the full computation of the 3D dose distributions.  Conclusions:   Combining the gMCO algorithm with automated and interactive plan navigation tools resulted in simultaneous gains in both plan quality and planning efficiency.""","""['Cédric Bélanger', 'Éric Poulin', 'Songye Cui', 'Éric Vigneault', 'André-Guy Martin', 'William Foster', 'Philippe Després', 'J Adam M Cunha', 'Luc Beaulieu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Commissioning of GPU-based multi-criteria optimizer combined with plan navigation tools for high-dose-rate brachytherapy.', 'Inter-observer evaluation of a GPU-based multicriteria optimization algorithm combined with plan navigation tools for HDR brachytherapy.', 'A GPU-based multi-criteria optimization algorithm for HDR brachytherapy.', 'Use of three-dimensional radiation therapy planning tools and intraoperative ultrasound to evaluate high dose rate prostate brachytherapy implants.', 'Optimization in treatment planning of high dose-rate brachytherapy - Review and analysis of mathematical models.', 'Commissioning of GPU-based multi-criteria optimizer combined with plan navigation tools for high-dose-rate brachytherapy.', 'Artificial intelligence can overcome challenges in brachytherapy treatment planning.']"""

Methods:   From 2006 to 2010, 490,966 UK Biobank participants, aged 37 to 73 years, were recruited. They were followed from 2006 to 2018. Nonlinear associations between self-reported TV time (hours per day) and outcomes explored using penalized cubic splines in Cox proportional hazards adjusted for demographics and lifestyle. Population-attributable and potential impact fractions were calculated to contextualize population-level health outcomes associated with different TV time levels. Nonlinear isotemporal substitution analyses were used to investigate substituting TV time with alternative activities. Primary outcomes were mortality: all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer; incidence: CVD and cancer; secondary outcomes were incident myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure and colon, lung, breast, and prostate cancer.  Results:   Those with noncommunicable disease (109,867 [22.4%]), CVD (32,243 [6.6%]), and cancer (37,81 [7.7%]) at baseline were excluded from all-cause mortality, CVD, and cancer analyses, respectively. After 7.0 years (mortality) and 6.2 years (disease incidence) mean follow-up, there were 10,306 (2.7%) deaths, 24,388 (5.3%) CVD events, and 39,121 (8.7%) cancer events. Associations between TV time and all-cause and CVD mortality were curvilinear (Pnon-linear ≤.003), with lowest risk observed <2 hours per day. Theoretically, 8.64% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.60-10.73) of CVD mortality is attributable to TV time. Limiting TV time to 2 hours per day might have prevented, or at least delayed, 7.97% (95% CI, 5.54-10.70) of CVD deaths. Substituting TV time with sleeping, walking, or moderate or vigorous physical activity was associated with reduced risk for all outcomes when baseline levels of substitute activities were low.  Conclusion:   TV time is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes. Future guidelines could suggest limiting TV time to less than 2 hours per day to reduce most of the associated adverse health events.""","""['Hamish M E Foster', 'Frederick K Ho', 'Naveed Sattar', 'Paul Welsh', 'Jill P Pell', 'Jason M R Gill', 'Stuart R Gray', 'Carlos A Celis-Morales']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mayo Clin Proc""","""['The association between recreational screen time and cancer risk: findings from the UK Biobank, a large prospective cohort study.', 'Associations of discretionary screen time with mortality, cardiovascular disease and cancer are attenuated by strength, fitness and physical activity: findings from the UK Biobank study.', 'Joint associations of smoking and television viewing time on cancer and cardiovascular disease mortality.', 'Aspirin Use in Adults: Cancer, All-Cause Mortality, and Harms: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Behavioral Counseling to Promote a Healthful Diet and Physical Activity for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention in Adults Without Known Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors: Updated Systematic Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Analysis of the 24-h activity cycle: An illustration examining the association with cognitive function in the Adult Changes in Thought study.', 'Associations of sedentary time and physical activity with adverse health conditions: Outcome-wide analyses using isotemporal substitution model.', 'Adverse associations of sedentary behavior with cancer incidence and all-cause mortality: A prospective cohort study.']"""

African-American men (AA) represent more aggressive form of the disease compared to Caucasian (CA) counterparts. Several lines of evidences suggest that biological factors are responsible for the observed racial disparity.  Aim:   This study was aimed at identifying the epigenetic variation among AA and CA PCa patients and whether DNA methylation differences have an association with clinical outcomes in the two races.  Methods and results:   The cancer genome atlas (TCGA) dataset (2015) was used to identify existing epigenetic variation in AA and CA PCa patients. Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) was performed to identify global DNA methylation changes in a small cohort of AA and CA PCa patients. The RRBS data were then used to identify survival and recurrence outcomes in AA and CA PCa patients using publicly available datasets. The TCGA data analysis revealed epigenetic heterogeneity, which could be categorized into four classes. AA associated primarily to methylation cluster 1 (p = 0.048), and CA associated to methylation cluster 3 (p = 0.000146). Enrichment of the Wnt signaling pathway was identified in both the races; however, they were differentially activated in terms of canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling. This was further validated using the Decipher Genomics Resource Information Database (GRID). The RRBS data also identified discrete methylation patterns in AA compared with CA and, in part, validated our TCGA findings. Survival analysis using the RRBS data suggested hypomethylated genes to be significantly associated with recurrence of PCa in CA (p = 6.07 × 10-6) as well as in AA (p = 0.0077).  Conclusion:   Overall, we observed epigenetic-based racial disparity in PCa which could affect survival and should be considered during prognosis and treatment.""","""['Richa Rai', 'Shalini S Yadav', 'Heng Pan', 'Irtaza Khan', ""James O'Connor"", 'Mohammed Alshalalfa', 'Elai Davicioni', 'Emanuela Taioli', 'Olivier Elemento', 'Ashutosh K Tewari', 'Kamlesh K Yadav']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Cancer Rep (Hoboken)""","""['High circulating estrogens and selective expression of ERβ in prostate tumors of Americans: implications for racial disparity of prostate cancer.', 'Genome-wide differentially methylated genes in prostate cancer tissues from African-American and Caucasian men.', 'Association of Genetic Ancestry With DNA Methylation Changes in Prostate Cancer Disparity.', 'Racial disparity in prostate cancer in the African American population with actionable ideas and novel immunotherapies.', 'miRNAs as drivers of TMPRSS2-ERG negative prostate tumors in African American men.', 'Immunologic Assessment of Tumors from a Race-matched Military Cohort Identifies Mast Cell Depletion as a Marker of Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Biomarkers of Aggressive Prostate Cancer at Diagnosis.', 'MethBank 4.0: an updated database of DNA methylation across a variety of species.', 'Comparing Urinary Glycoproteins among Three Urogenital Cancers and Identifying Prostate Cancer-Specific Glycoproteins.', 'A biosocial return to race?
