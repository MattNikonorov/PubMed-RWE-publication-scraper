Towards credible biological evaluation, an in vitro anticancer activity assay was conducted employing a library of 60 cancer cell lines constituting nine panels representing blood, lung, colon, CNS, skin, ovary, renal, prostate, and breast cancers. The results revealed high effectiveness and broad-spectrum anticancer activity of compounds 4m and 4g. Five-dose assay of compounds 4m and 4g proved their high potency that surpassed that of four standard kinase inhibitors FDA-approved anticancer drugs against many cancer cells. Towards the identification of their molecular target, screening of kinase inhibitory profile employing a panel of 51 kinases involved in cancer revealed inhibition of several kinases from the platelet-derived growth factor/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (PVR) kinase family, which might mediate, at least in part, the antiproliferative activity. Molecular docking of 4g into the crystal structure of the Feline McDonough Sarcoma (FMS) kinase predicted that it binds to a pocket formed by the juxtamembrane domain, the catalytic loop, and the αE helix, thus stabilizing the inhibited conformation of the kinase. Flow cytometric study of the cytotoxic effects of compound 4g in A549 cells showed it induces dose- and time-dependent apoptotic events leading to cell death. Collectively, this work presents compound 4g as a potential broad-spectrum anticancer agent against multiple cancer types.""","""['Ahmed Karam Farag', 'Ahmed H E Hassan', 'Kyung-Sook Chung', 'Jeong-Hun Lee', 'Hyo-Sun Gil', 'Kyung-Tae Lee', 'Eun Joo Roh']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Bioorg Chem""","""['Cytotoxic and Apoptotic Effects of Novel Pyrrolo2,3-dPyrimidine Derivatives Containing Urea Moieties on Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Design and synthesis of new RAF kinase-inhibiting antiproliferative quinoline derivatives.

Materials and methods:   Planned dose distributions for up to 657 patients of the Trans Tasman Radiation Oncology Group 03.04 RADAR trial were deformably registered onto a single exemplar computed tomography dataset. Voxel-based multiple comparison permutation dose difference testing, Cox regression modelling and LASSO feature selection were used to identify regions where dose-increase was associated with grade ≥2 rectal bleeding (RB) or tenesmus, according to the LENT/SOMA scale. This was externally validated by registering dose distributions from the RT01 (n = 388) and CHHiP (n = 241) trials onto the same exemplar and repeating the tests on each of these data sets, and on all three datasets combined.  Results:   Voxel-based Cox regression and permutation dose difference testing revealed regions where increased dose was correlated with gastrointestinal toxicity. Grade ≥2 RB was associated with posteriorly extended lateral beams that manifested high doses (>55 Gy) in a small rectal volume adjacent to the clinical target volume. A correlation was found between grade ≥2 tenesmus and increased low-intermediate dose (∼25 Gy) at the posterior beam region, including the posterior rectum and perirectal fat space (PRFS).

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively evaluated the initial cases operated by 14 surgeons in 12 different international centres. Pre-, peri- and postoperative features of the first 50 patients operated by each surgeon in all the participating centres were collected. The effect of surgical experience on peri-operative, functional and oncological outcomes was firstly evaluated after stratification by level of surgical experience (initial [≤25 cases] and expert [>25 cases]) and after using locally weighted scatterplot smoothing to graphically explore the relationship between surgical experience and the outcomes of interest.  Results:   We evaluated 626 patients. The median follow-up was 13 months in the initial group and 9 months in the expert group (P = 0.002). Preoperative features overlapped between the two groups. Shorter console time (140 vs 120 min; P = 0.001) and a trend towards lower complications rates (13 vs 5.5%; P = 0.038) were observed in the expert group. The relationship between surgical experience and console time, immediate urinary continence recovery and Clavien-Dindo grade ≥2 complications was linear, without reaching a plateau, after 50 cases. Conversely, a non-linear relationship was observed between surgical experience and positive surgical margins (PSMs).  Conclusions:   In this first report of a multicentre experience of RsRARP during the learning curve, we found that console time, immediate urinary continence recovery and postoperative complications are optimal from the beginning and further quickly improve during the learning process, while PSM rates did not clearly improve over the first 50 cases.""","""['Antonio Galfano', 'Silvia Secco', ""Paolo Dell'Oglio"", 'Koon Rha', 'Christopher Eden', 'Karen Fransis', 'Prasanna Sooriakumaran', 'Pedro Sanchez De La Muela', 'Keith Kowalczyk', 'Tomoaki Miyagawa', 'Christophe Assenmacher', 'Akio Matsubara', 'Kun-Yuan Chiu', 'Ugur Boylu', 'Harry Lee', 'Aldo Massimo Bocciardi']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Retzius-sparing robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: functional and early oncologic results in aggressive and locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Retzius-sparing Robotic Radical Prostatectomy for Surgeons in the Learning Curve: A Propensity Score-matching Analysis.', 'Retzius-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy improves early recovery of urinary continence: a randomized, controlled, single-blind trial with a 1-year follow-up.', 'Retzius-Sparing Robot-Assisted Robotic Prostatectomy: Past, Present, and Future.', 'Current status of various neurovascular bundle-sparing techniques in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Incidence of Rectal Injury After Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'The learning curves of major laparoscopic and robotic procedures in urology: a systematic review.', 'Is It Safe to Switch from a Standard Anterior to Retzius-Sparing Approach in Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy?', 'Retzius-sparing vs. standard robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for clinically localised prostate cancer: a comparative study.', 'Challenging cases in high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with Retzius-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.']"""

Methods:   From August 2015-March 2018, 103 newly diagnosed patients with prostate cancer and their partners were divided into a control group (CG) (N = 50), PIP group (N = 25) and MPI group (N = 28). The CG received usual care, the PIP group received information manuals and telephone counselling for 6-week and the MPI group received multimedia films and manuals and professional support for 6 weeks. The three groups were posttested 6, 10, 18 and 24 weeks after the pre-test. The outcome measurements included disease appraisals, emotion status, relationship satisfaction, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and satisfaction with MPI.  Results/findings:   Partners in the MPI and PIP groups experienced significant improvements in positive and negative affect or mental HRQOL as compared with the CG.

Methods for quantification of signal evolution need to be robust and reproducible across a range of experimental conditions. Pharmacokinetic analysis of dynamic spectroscopic imaging data from hyperpolarized pyruvate and its metabolites generally assumes that signal arises from ideal rectangular slice excitation profiles. In this study, we examined whether this assumption could lead to bias in kinetic analysis of hyperpolarized pyruvate and, if so, whether such a bias can be corrected. A Bloch-McConnell simulator was used to generate synthetic data using a known set of ""ground truth"" pharmacokinetic parameter values. Signal evolution was then analyzed using analysis software that either assumed a uniform slice profile, or incorporated information about the slice profile into the analysis. To correct for slice profile effects, the expected slice profile was subdivided into multiple sub-slices to account for variable excitation angles along the slice dimension. An ensemble of sub-slices was then used to fit the measured signal evolution. A mismatch between slice profiles used for data acquisition and those assumed during kinetic analysis was identified as a source of quantification bias. Results indicate that imperfect slice profiles preferentially increase detected lactate signal, leading to an overestimation of the apparent metabolic exchange rate. The slice profile-correction algorithm was tested in simulation, in phantom measurements, and applied to data acquired from a patient with prostate cancer. The results demonstrated that slice profile-induced biases can be minimized by accounting for the slice profile during pharmacokinetic analysis. This algorithm can be used to correct data from either single or multislice acquisitions.""","""['Christopher M Walker', 'Jeremy W Gordon', 'Zhan Xu', 'Keith A Michel', 'Liang Li', 'Peder E Z Larson', 'Daniel B Vigneron', 'James A Bankson']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""NMR Biomed""","""['The effect of transmit B1 inhomogeneity on hyperpolarized 1-13 C-pyruvate metabolic MR imaging biomarkers.', 'A novel perfused Bloch-McConnell simulator for analyzing the accuracy of dynamic hyperpolarized MRS.', 'Investigation of analysis methods for hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate metabolic MRI in prostate cancer patients.', 'Overestimation of cardiac lactate production caused by liver metabolism of hyperpolarized 1-13 Cpyruvate.', 'Hyperpolarized Metabolic MRI-Acquisition, Reconstruction, and Analysis Methods.', 'Model-constrained reconstruction accelerated with Fourier-based undersampling for hyperpolarized 1-13 C pyruvate imaging.', 'The effect of transmit B1 inhomogeneity on hyperpolarized 1-13 C-pyruvate metabolic MR imaging biomarkers.', 'Modeling hyperpolarized lactate signal dynamics in cells, patient-derived tissue slice cultures and murine models.']"""

Previously we compared the RNA-seq data from control and WA-treated 22Rv1 human prostate cancer cells to identify mechanistic targets of this phytochemical. The Gene Ontology pathway analysis of the RNA-seq data revealed significant upregulation of genes associated with autophagy upon WA treatment in 22Rv1 cells. In this study, we extended these findings to investigate the mechanism underlying WA-induced autophagy. Initially, we confirmed autophagy induction by WA treatment by transmission electron microscopy using three prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, 22Rv1, and PC-3). Fourteen common genes altered by 8- and 16-hour exposure to WA were identified from human autophagy PCR array and these results were consistent with the RNA-seq data. Two key autophagy markers (LC3BII and SQSTM1) were robustly increased in WA-exposed LNCaP, 22Rv1, and PC-3 cells as determined by immunoblotting, and this effect was elevated in the presence of autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (BafA1). BafA1 treatment augmented WA's cytotoxicity and subsequently its proapoptotic potential. WA treatment induced GABARAPL1 (ATG8L) protein expression in all three cell lines and its knockdown by RNA interference attenuated WA-mediated apoptosis.

Methods:   We used recalled dietary data from 162,816 participants in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study to investigate associations for milk, cheese, ice cream, total dairy, and calcium intake at ages 12-13 years with incident total (n = 17,729), advanced (n = 2,348), and fatal PCa (n = 827) over 14 years of follow-up. We calculated relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by Cox proportional hazards regression.  Results:   We observed suggestive positive trends for milk, dairy, and calcium intake with total and/or advanced PCa (p-trends = 0.016-0.148). These trends attenuated after adjustment for additional components of adolescent diet, particularly red meat and vegetables/potatoes. In contrast, suggestive inverse trends were observed for cheese and ice cream intake with total and/or advanced PCa (p-trends = 0.043-0.153), and for milk, dairy, and calcium intake with fatal PCa (p-trend = 0.045-0.117).  Conclusion:   Although these findings provide some support for a role of adolescent diet in increasing PCa risk, particularly for correlates of milk intake or overall dietary patterns, our protective findings for cheese and ice cream intake with PCa risk and mortality, and for all dairy products with PCa mortality, suggest alternative explanations, such as the influence of early-life socioeconomic status, and increased PCa screening, earlier detection, and better PCa care.""","""['Tuo Lan', 'Yikyung Park', 'Graham A Colditz', 'Jingxia Liu', 'Molin Wang', 'Kana Wu', 'Edward Giovannucci', 'Siobhan Sutcliffe']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['Adolescent animal product intake in relation to later prostate cancer risk and mortality in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study.', 'Adolescent Plant Product Intake in Relation to Later Prostate Cancer Risk and Mortality in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study.', 'Adolescent dietary patterns in relation to later prostate cancer risk and mortality in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study.', 'Dairy products intake and cancer mortality risk: a meta-analysis of 11 population-based cohort studies.', 'Dairy products and pancreatic cancer risk: a pooled analysis of 14 cohort studies.', 'Milk Intake in Early Life and Later Cancer Risk: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Adolescent animal product intake in relation to later prostate cancer risk and mortality in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study.']"""

However, in some cancers, TRIM28 is upregulated and interacts with different partners, many of which are transcription regulators such as EZH2 in MCF7 cells, to form abnormal repressive or activating complexes that lead to misregulation of genes. We ask whether a KRAB domain-the TRIM28 interaction domain present in native binding partners of TRIM28 that mediate repression of transposable elements-could be used as a tool molecule to disrupt aberrant TRIM28 complexes. Expression of KRAB domain containing fragments from a KRAB-ZF protein (ZFP568) in MCF7 cells, without the DNA-binding zinc fingers, inhibited TRIM28-EZH2 interactions and caused degradation of both TRIM28 and EZH2 proteins as well as other components of the EZH2-associated polycomb repressor 2 complex. In consequence, the product of EZH2 enzymatic activity, trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 level, was significantly reduced. The expression of a synthetic KRAB domain significantly inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells (MCF7) but has no effect on normal (immortalized) human mammary epithelial cells (MCF10a). Further, we found that TRIM28 is a positive regulator of TRIM24 protein levels, as observed previously in prostate cancer cells, and expression of the KRAB domain also lowered TRIM24 protein. Importantly, reduction of TRIM24 levels, by treatment with either the KRAB domain or a small-molecule degrader targeted to TRIM24, is accompanied by an elevated level of tumor suppressor p53. Taken together, this study reveals a novel mechanism for a TRIM28-associated protein stability network and establishes TRIM28 as a potential therapeutic target in cancers where TRIM28 is elevated.

Moreover, early-stage downregulation of anti-inflammatory gene: bone morphogenetic protein 7 gene was observed. These findings suggest that exposure to EB, T, and E activates multiple pathways and simultaneously downregulates anti-inflammatory genes. Interestingly, these genes are reportedly expressed in prostate cancer tissues/cell lines.

Methods:   A total of 110 consecutive patients with clinically localized PCa were prospectively randomized in a 1:1 ratio to an anterior group (n = 55) or a posterior group (n = 55). The primary outcome was immediate UC, defined as freedom from any pad use within 1 week after removal of the urinary catheter. The UC rate following surgery was also calculated with Kaplan-Meier curves, and the log-rank test was used for statistical comparison. Intra-operative outcomes, pathological data and oncological outcomes, including positive surgical margin (PSM) status and biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS), were also compared between the two groups. The comparison of the two approaches was also analysed in subgroups after risk stratification.  Results:   Of the patients who underwent the posterior approach, 69.1% achieved immediate UC compared with 30.9% in the anterior group (relative risk 2.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.48-3.51; P = 0.000).

These tumours are frequently accompanied by grade group 1 acinar cancer and behave relatively indolently. In contrast, conventional ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate is an aggressive variant comparable to grade group 4 acinar cancer. Here, we used targeted next-generation sequencing to molecularly profile PIN-like ductal carcinoma cases at radical prostatectomy.  Methods and results:   Five PIN-like ductal carcinoma samples at radical prostatectomy with sufficient tumour tissue available were analysed for genomic alterations by targeted next-generation sequencing using the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) solid tumour panel. DNA was captured using SureSelect for 640 genes and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq platform. Three of five (60%) of the PIN-like ductal carcinomas showed activating mutations in the RAS/RAF pathways, which are extraordinarily rare in conventional primary prostate carcinoma (<3% of cases), including an activating hot-spot BRAF mutation (p.K601E), an activating hot-spot mutation in HRAS (p.Q61K) and an in-frame activating deletion in BRAF (p.T488_Q493delinsK). An additional two cases lacked BRAF or HRAS mutations, but harboured in-frame insertions of uncertain significance in MAP2K4 and MAP3K6. One case had sufficient acinar tumour for sequencing, and showed a similar molecular profile as the concurrent PIN-like ductal carcinoma, suggesting a clonal relationship between the two components.  Conclusions:   PIN-like ductal carcinoma represents a molecularly unique tumour, enriched for potentially targetable oncogenic driver mutations in the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway. This molecular profile contrasts with that of conventional ductal adenocarcinoma, which is typically enriched for pathogenic mutations in the mismatch repair (MMR) and homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair pathways.""","""['Harsimar B Kaur', 'Daniela C Salles', 'Adina Paulk', 'Jonathan I Epstein', 'James R Eshleman', 'Tamara L Lotan']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Histopathology""","""['Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate in the absence of high-grade invasive carcinoma represents a molecularly distinct type of in situ carcinoma enriched with oncogenic driver mutations.', 'High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasialike ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate: a clinicopathologic study of 28 cases.', 'PIN-like (Ductal) Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate.', 'High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, PIN-like carcinoma, ductal carcinoma, and intraductal carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate Gland: Recent Advances.', 'Prostate Pathology: What is New in the 2022 WHO Classification of Urinary and Male Genital Tumors?', 'WHO Classification of Tumours fifth edition: evolving issues in the classification, diagnosis, and prognostication of prostate cancer.']"""

Current approaches to quantify and mitigate such uncertainties rely on explicitly computed error scenarios and are thus subject to statistical uncertainty and limitations regarding the underlying uncertainty model. Here we present an alternative, analytical method to approximate moments, in particular expectation value and (co)variance, of the probability distribution of DVH-points, and evaluate its accuracy on patient data.  Methods:   We use Analytical Probabilistic Modeling (APM) to derive moments of the probability distribution over individual DVH-points based on the probability distribution over dose. By using the computed moments to parameterize distinct probability distributions over DVH-points (here normal or beta distributions), not only the moments but also percentiles, that is, α - DVHs, are computed. The model is subsequently evaluated on three patient cases (intracranial, paraspinal, prostate) in 30- and single-fraction scenarios by assuming the dose to follow a multivariate normal distribution, whose moments are computed in closed-form with APM. The results are compared to a benchmark based on discrete random sampling.  Results:   The evaluation of the new probabilistic model on the three patient cases against a sampling benchmark proves its correctness under perfect assumptions as well as good agreement in realistic conditions. More precisely, ca. 90% of all computed expected DVH-points and their standard deviations agree within 1% volume with their empirical counterpart from sampling computations, for both fractionated and single fraction treatments. When computing α - DVH, the assumption of a beta distribution achieved better agreement with empirical percentiles than the assumption of a normal distribution: While in both cases probabilities locally showed large deviations (up to ±0.2), the respective - DVHs for α={0.05,0.5,0.95} only showed small deviations in respective volume (up to ±5% volume for a normal distribution, and up to 2% for a beta distribution). A previously published model from literature, which was included for comparison, exhibited substantially larger deviations.  Conclusions:   With APM we could derive a mathematically exact description of moments of probability distributions over DVH-points given a probability distribution over dose. The model generalizes previous attempts and performs well for both choices of probability distributions, that is, normal or beta distributions, over DVH-points.""","""['Niklas Wahl', 'Philipp Hennig', 'Hans-Peter Wieser', 'Mark Bangert']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Efficiency of analytical and sampling-based uncertainty propagation in intensity-modulated proton therapy.', 'Analytical probabilistic modeling for radiation therapy treatment planning.', 'Confidence intervals in dose volume histogram computation.', 'The linear-quadratic transformation of dose-volume histograms in fractionated radiotherapy.', 'Probabilistic approaches to better quantifying the results of epidemiologic studies.']"""

Methods:   Total of 263 patients with the dominant index lesion scored PI-RADS 3 who underwent biopsy and/or follow-up formed the primary cohort. One-step RML (RML-i) model integrated radiomic features of T2WI, DWI, and ADC images all together, and two-step RML (RML-ii) model integrated the three independent radiomic signatures from T2WI (T2WIRS), DWI (DWIRS), and ADC (ADCRS) separately into a regression model. The two RML models, as well as T2WIRS, DWIRS, and ADCRS, were compared using the receiver operating characteristic-derived area under the curve (AUC), calibration plot, and decision-curve analysis (DCA). Two radiologists were asked to give a subjective binary assessment, and Cohen's kappa statistics were calculated.  Results:   A total of 59/263 (22.4%) csPCa were identified. Inter-reader agreement was moderate (Kappa = 0.435). The AUC of RML-i (0.89; 95% CI 0.88-0.90) is higher (p = 0.003) than that of RML-ii (0.87; 95% CI 0.86-0.88).

At our institution, both athermal and ultrasonic dissection have been used over the last years to perform a nerve-sparing laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (NSLRP). In this study, we compare functional and oncological outcomes of the two procedures.  Methods:   All charts from patients undergoing NSLRP between January 2009 and June 2015 were reviewed. The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) was recorded preoperatively and 3, 12 and 24 months after surgery; continence was recorded at 3 and 12 months; PSA was recorded at last follow-up. Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the association of variables with functional and oncological outcomes.  Results:   Ultrasonic NSLRP was used for 120 patients, while athermal NSLRP on 111. The impact of the cutting technique on erection recovery was different at 3 months, favoring athermal dissection (p = 0.002); however, significance was lost at 12 (p = 0.09) and 24 (p = 0.14) months. Continence recovery was comparable at 3 (p = 0.1) and 12 (p = 0.2) months; the rate of positive surgical margins and PSA recurrence were also similar (p = 0.2 and p = 0.06, respectively). At univariate analysis, age, Gleason sum, nerve-sparing laterality, and extension (intra- vs interfascial) were associated with overall erection recovery; only age and nerve-sparing laterality were independent predictors.

Recognition of financial hardship among cancer survivors is growing. We investigated, for the first time, associations between levels of financial stress and CRF among PCa survivors.  Methods:   We used data from PCa survivors who had been identified through two population-based cancer registries covering the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and had completed a postal questionnaire. CRF was measured by the fatigue subscale of the EORTC QLQ-C30. Financial stress was assessed as household ability to make ends meet (i) pre-diagnosis and (ii) at questionnaire completion (post-diagnosis). Multivariable logistic regression was used to relate financial stress to clinically important CRF (fatigue subscale score ≥ 39 of a possible 100).  Results:   Two thousand four hundred fifty-eight PCa survivors were included. Of these, 268 (10.9%) reported pre-diagnosis financial stress only, 317 (12.9%) post-diagnosis stress only and 270 (11.0%) both pre- and post-diagnosis stress (cumulative stress); 470 (19.1%) reported clinically important CRF. After controlling for confounders, survivors with cumulative financial stress exposure were significantly more likely to have CRF (OR = 4.58, 95% CI 3.30-6.35, p < 0.001), compared with those without financial stress. There was a suggestion of a dose-response relationship (OR = 1.83, 95% CI 1.27-2.65, p = 0.001 for pre-diagnosis financial stress only; and OR = 4.11, 95% CI 3.01-5.61, p < 0.001 for post-diagnosis financial stress only).

However, cancer screening requires a complex array of tasks such as seeking up-to-date guidelines, making appointments, planning hospital visits, and communicating with health care professionals. Importantly, modern health care largely relies on technology to disseminate the latest information and administer the system. Yet, little is known about the technology-related skills that are relevant to regular cancer screening. This study examined the association between problem-solving skills in the technology-rich environment and cancer screening in later life. Using 2012/2014 Program for International Assessment of Adult Competencies data, binary logistic regressions with survey weights were used to estimate the association between problem-solving skills in the technology-rich environment and four cancer screening behaviors among the corresponding target populations aged between 45 and 74 years old (n = 1374 for cervical screening; n = 1373 for breast screening; n = 1166 for prostate screening; n = 2563 for colon screening). Results showed that greater problem-solving skills in the technology-rich environment scores (0-500 points) were significantly and positively associated with prostate cancer screening (odds ratio = 1.005, P < 0.05) among men, but not with colon (men and women) or cervical or breast (women) cancer screenings.

Methods:   At study enrolment (2010-2014), self-reported personal cancer history, cancer type and cancer risk factor data were sought from 19,114 participants (Australia, n = 16,703; U.S., n = 2411). Eligible participants were healthy, free of major diseases and expected to survive 5 years.  Results:   Nearly 20% of enrolling ASPREE participants reported a prior cancer diagnosis; 18% of women and 22% of men, with women diagnosed younger (16% vs 6% of diagnoses <50 years). Cancer prevalence increased with age. Prevalence of prostate and breast cancer history were higher in U.S. participants; melanoma and colorectal cancer were higher in Australian participants. Cancer history prevalence was not associated with contemporary common risk factors nor previous aspirin use, but was associated with poor health ratings in men. Blood and breast cancer history were more common with past aspirin use.  Conclusions:   Personal cancer history in healthy older ASPREE participants was as expected for the most common cancer types in the respective populations, but was not necessarily aligned with known risk factors. We attribute this to survivor bias, likely driven by entry criteria.

However, whether cfDNA concentration is predictive of treatment outcomes with androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs) is unknown. We quantified plasma cfDNA levels at baseline (n = 74) and 4 weeks on treatment (n = 56) in a prospective cohort of mCRPC patients treated with the ARPIs abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide. Elevated total cfDNA concentration (log10) at both baseline (hazard ratio [HR] 5.5, p < 0.001) and week 4 (HR 7.5, p < 0.001) was a significant negative prognostic factor for overall survival (OS), a finding maintained after adjustment for plasma circulating tumour DNA fraction. Unexpectedly, a rise in cfDNA concentration from baseline to week 4 was also associated with significantly improved OS (HR 0.14, p = 0.003). Conversely, patients with ≥29.8% decrease in cfDNA from baseline (optimal cut-point) had significantly shorter median OS than the rest of the cohort (10.5 vs 25.7 mo, p = 0.03). Collectively, our findings point to the potential prognostic utility of quantifying cfDNA in mCRPC and in particular suggest that dynamic changes in total cfDNA levels may be a novel early predictive biomarker for therapeutic outcome in ARPI-treated patients. PATIENT SUMMARY: We measured the levels of total cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in the plasma of patients with metastatic prostate cancer prior to and 4 weeks after starting new hormonal drugs. We found that patients with higher levels of cfDNA or a higher proportion of tumour-derived DNA at baseline had worse outcomes on hormonal therapies. Similarly, higher levels of cfDNA at 4 weeks into therapy were also associated with worse outcomes. However, a rise in total cfDNA levels at 4 weeks compared with baseline was linked with better outcomes. Measuring changes in cfDNA concentration may be a useful and technically straightforward early way to predict how patients will respond to treatment in metastatic prostate cancer.""","""['Heidi Fettke', 'Edmond M Kwan', 'Patricia Bukczynska', 'Nicole Ng', 'Tu Nguyen-Dumont', 'Melissa C Southey', 'Ian D Davis', 'Andrew Mant', 'Phillip Parente', 'Carmel Pezaro', 'Christine Hauser', 'Arun A Azad']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Plasma Cell-free DNA Concentration and Outcomes from Taxane Therapy in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer from Two Phase III Trials (FIRSTANA and PROSELICA).', 'Combined Cell-free DNA and RNA Profiling of the Androgen Receptor: Clinical Utility of a Novel Multianalyte Liquid Biopsy Assay for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Plasma Androgen Receptor and Docetaxel for Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Treating Patients with Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review of Available Therapies.', 'Finding the optimal treatment sequence in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer-a narrative review.', 'Cell-free DNA in the management of prostate cancer: Current status and future prospective.', 'Recent Advances in Blood-Based Liquid Biopsy Approaches in Prostate Cancer.', 'Cell-Free DNA as a Prognostic Biomarker for Monitoring Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer.', 'Overcoming Obstacles in Liquid Biopsy Developments for Prostate Cancer.', 'Cell-Free DNA Variant Sequencing Using Plasma and AR-V7 Testing of Circulating Tumor Cells in Prostate Cancer Patients.']"""

To examine impacts of cancer type and side effects on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in long-term cancer survivorship, we evaluated 5-year follow-up of patients with prostate cancer and compared results with a matched group of male long-term survivors of other local-stage cancers.  Materials and methods:   We examined genitourinary, bowel and sexual symptoms, and general quality of life. Matched survivors of colorectal, lung, and bladder cancers were recruited via registries in 3 different regions in the United States. Patients were surveyed 3-5 years after diagnosis with the SF-12 and EPIC to evaluate general mental and physical health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and patient function and bother.  Results:   We analyzed responses from long-term prostate (n = 77) and bladder, colorectal, and lung cancer (n = 124) patients. In multivariate analysis, long-term local stage prostate cancer survivors had significantly higher SF-12 physical component scores but did not differ from long-term survivors of other cancers in terms of their SF-12 mental summary scores. Prostate survivors had similar mental, urinary, bowel, and sexual HRQoL compared to long-term survivors of other local stage cancers.  Conclusion:   Long-term general and prostate-specific HRQoL was similar between local stage prostate and bladder, colorectal, and lung patients with cancer.

This study aimed to investigate whether lack of dose to subclinical disease is associated with increased disease progression by using high-quality prostate radiation therapy clinical trial data to identify anatomically localized regions where dose variation is associated with prostate-specific antigen progression (PSAP).  Methods and materials:   Planned dose distributions for 683 patients of the Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group 03.04 Randomized Androgen Deprivation and Radiotherapy (RADAR) trial were deformably registered onto a single exemplar computed tomography data set. These were divided into high-risk and intermediate-risk subgroups for analysis. Three independent voxel-based statistical tests, using permutation testing, Cox regression modeling, and least absolute shrinkage selection operator feature selection, were applied to identify regions where dose variation was associated with PSAP. Results from the intermediate-risk RADAR subgroup were externally validated by registering dose distributions from the RT01 (n = 388) and Conventional or Hypofractionated High Dose Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer Trial (CHHiP) (n = 253) trials onto the same exemplar and repeating the tests on each of these data sets.  Results:   Voxel-based Cox regression revealed regions where reduced dose was correlated with increased prostate-specific androgen progression. Reduced dose in regions associated with coverage at the posterior prostate, in the immediate periphery of the posterior prostate, and in regions corresponding to the posterior oblique beams or posterior lateral beam boundary, was associated with increased PSAP for RADAR and RT01 patients, but not for CHHiP patients. Reduced dose to the seminal vesicle region was also associated with increased PSAP for RADAR intermediate-risk patients.  Conclusions:   Ensuring adequate dose coverage at the posterior prostate and immediately surrounding posterior region (including the seminal vesicles), where aggressive cancer spread may be occurring, may improve tumor control. It is recommended that particular care be taken when defining margins at the prostate posterior, acknowledging the trade-off between quality of life due to rectal dose and the preferences of clinicians and patients.""","""['Marco Marcello', 'James W Denham', 'Angel Kennedy', 'Annette Haworth', 'Allison Steigler', 'Peter B Greer', 'Lois C Holloway', 'Jason A Dowling', 'Michael G Jameson', 'Dale Roach', 'David J Joseph', 'Sarah L Gulliford', 'David P Dearnaley', 'Matthew R Sydes', 'Emma Hall', 'Martin A Ebert']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Posterior Margins in Prostate Cancer Radiation Therapy.', 'Flogging a Dead Salmon?

Despite the acquisition of a NE phenotype, more than half of NEPCa expressed AR and the androgen-regulated gene NKX3.1, more frequently in cases admixed with conventional PCa. TTF1 staining, present in half of NEPCa, was associated with loss of androgen-regulated genes and with markers of aggressiveness, including increased proliferation, Zeb1 expression and PTEN loss.

Methods and materials:   Patients with nmCRPC were identified from the Veterans Health Administration electronic health record database (1/2007-8/2017). PSADT was categorized as <3 months, 3 to 9 months, 9 to 15 months, ≥15 months, and unknown. MFS and OS were assessed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression, including PSADT as a predictor. HRU and costs were described per-patient-per-year (PPPY).  Results:   Among 12,083 patients in the study, shorter PSADT was associated with shorter MFS and OS (PSADT <3 months vs. PSADT ≥15 months hazard ratio [HR] [95% confidence interval (CI)] = 0.307 [0.281, 0.335] and 0.371 [0.335, 0.410], respectively).

However, most studies using HypoRT only included the prostate as the target volume. We report long-term outcomes of patients with high-risk prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and HypoRT to the prostate and nodal areas with a simultaneous integrated boost technique.  Methods and materials:   Patients with localized, high-risk prostate cancer entered a prospective phase I/II study with a HypoRT regimen of 60 Gy/20 fractions (4 weeks) to the prostate volume while the nodal areas received 44 Gy in the same 20 fractions delivered with intensity modulated radiation therapy with a simultaneous integrated boost technique. ADT started 2 to 3 months before HypoRT. Toxicity was prospectively assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3. Outcomes rates were calculated by the actuarial method of Kaplan-Meier from the date of last radiation treatment until date of event.  Results:   We report on the first 105 patients treated between October 2010 and February 2014. Median follow-up was 74 months, with 97% of patients followed for more than 36 months.

Natural bioactive compounds were shown to possess pro-death properties in different tumors. We previously reported that δ-tocotrienol (δ-TT) induces apoptosis, paraptosis and autophagy in CRPC cells. Here, we investigated whether δ-TT might exert its activity by impairing mitochondrial functions. We demonstrated that, in PC3 and DU145 cells, δ-TT impairs mitochondrial respiration and structural dynamics. In both cell lines, δ-TT triggers mitochondrial Ca2+ and ROS overload. In PC3 cells, both Ca2+ and ROS mediate the δ-TT-related anticancer activities (decrease of cell viability, apoptosis, paraptosis, autophagy and mitophagy). As expected, in autophagy-defective DU145 cells, Ca2+ overload was involved in δ-TT-induced pro-death effects but not in autophagy and mitophagy. In this cell line, we also demonstrated that ROS overload is not involved in the anticancer activities of δ-TT, supporting a low susceptibility of these cells to ROS-related oxidative stress.

The addition of chelerythrine can significantly inhibit the proliferation of androgen-independent prostate cancer DU145 and PC-3 cells at the concentration of 5 and 10 μM, but not on androgen-dependent prostate cancer LNCaP cells as well as normal prostate epithelial cell line PrEC cells. Wound migration and transwell invasion assay showed the similar inhibitory effect of chelerythrine on the migration and invasion of DU145 and PC-3 cells in the same condition. Western blot analysis further confirmed that chelerythrine not only dramatically decreased MMP-2, MMP-9, and uPA protein expression, but also augmented the expression of their endogenous inhibitors (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2) and plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAI-1 and PAI-2) in both cancer cells. Meanwhile, NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors were all suppressed as evidenced by the decline of p-p65, c-Fos, and c-Jun protein expression in both cells.

Materials and methods:   Between April 2014 and April 2019, 124 patients underwent 13-Gy HDR-BT followed by EBRT (46 Gy/23 fractions). Urinary function and QOL were evaluated using IPSS and 7-grade QOL Scale, respectively. Biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS) was calculated.  Results:   Median follow-up period was 35.8 months; all patients received neoadjuvant hormonal therapy and very high-risk patients received adjuvant hormonal therapy. Only one patient developed a grade 3 toxicity (hematuria). Multivariate analysis showed the dose covering 30% of the urethral volume, bladder volume receiving 75% of the dose, and dose covering 2 cc of rectum were independent predictors of acute G2 urinary frequency, acute G2 urinary retention, and late G2 rectal hemorrhage.

We determined the ability of machine learning-based analysis of quantitative [18F]DCFPyL PET metrics to predict metastatic disease or high-risk pathological tumor features.  Methods:   In a prospective cohort study, 76 patients with intermediate- to high-risk PCa scheduled for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy with extended pelvic lymph node dissection underwent pre-operative [18F]DCFPyL PET-CT. Primary tumors were delineated using 50-70% peak isocontour thresholds on images with and without partial-volume correction (PVC). Four hundred and eighty standardized radiomic features were extracted per tumor. Random forest models were trained to predict lymph node involvement (LNI), presence of any metastasis, Gleason score ≥ 8, and presence of extracapsular extension (ECE). For comparison, models were also trained using standard PET features (SUVs, volume, total PSMA uptake). Model performance was validated using 50 times repeated 5-fold cross-validation yielding the mean receiver-operator characteristic curve AUC.  Results:   The radiomics-based machine learning models predicted LNI (AUC 0.86 ± 0.15, p < 0.01), nodal or distant metastasis (AUC 0.86 ± 0.14, p < 0.01), Gleason score (0.81 ± 0.16, p < 0.01), and ECE (0.76 ± 0.12, p < 0.01). The highest AUCs reached using standard PET metrics were lower than those of radiomics-based models. For LNI and metastasis prediction, PVC and a higher delineation threshold improved model stability. Machine learning pre-processing methods had a minor impact on model performance.  Conclusion:   Machine learning-based analysis of quantitative [18F]DCFPyL PET metrics can predict LNI and high-risk pathological tumor features in primary PCa patients.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) events and CV disease (CVD), especially in patients with preexisting CVD treated with GnRH agonists. Here, we investigated the potential relationship between serum levels of the cardiac biomarkers N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP), D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), and high-sensitivity troponin (hsTn) and the risk of new CV events in prostate cancer patients with a history of CVD receiving a GnRH agonist or antagonist.  Methods:   Post-hoc analyses were performed of a phase II randomized study that prospectively assessed CV events in patients with prostate cancer and preexisting CVD, receiving GnRH agonist or antagonist. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine whether the selected biomarkers had any predictive effect on CV events at baseline and across a 12-month treatment period.  Results:   Baseline and disease characteristics of the 80 patients who took part in the study were well balanced between treatment arms. Ischemic heart disease (66%) and myocardial infarction (37%) were the most common prior CVD and the majority (92%) of patients received CV medication. We found that high levels of NTproBNP (p = 0.008), and hsTn (p = 0.004) at baseline were associated with the development of new CV events in the GnRH agonist group but not in the antagonist. In addition, a nonsignificant trend was observed between higher levels of NTproBNP over time and the development of new CV events in the GnRH agonist group.  Conclusions:   The use of cardiac biomarkers may be worthy of further study as tools in the prediction of CV risk in prostate cancer patients receiving ADT.

Currently, cervical and breast cancer are the most diagnosed gynecological cancer type amongst black females in the Southern Sahara while amongst males prostate cancer is on the upward trend. With many of them still dependent on medicinal plants as a form of therapy and the need to identify new therapeutic agents, we have identified a commonly used medicinal plant Tulbaghia violacea Harv. commonly known as Itswele lomlambo (Xhosa), wilde knoffel (Afrikaans) and Isihaqa (zulu) to evaluate its anticancer properties at a molecular biology level. In this study, we evaluated the molecular mechanism of T. violacea extracts in regulating cell death in various cancer cell lines. To achieve this, T. violacea was collected, dried before crushing into a fine ground powder. Three organic solvents namely, methanol, hexane, and butanol at 10 g per 100 mL were used as extraction solvents. Each cell line was treated with varying concentrations of the plant extract to identify the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50). The IC 50 was later used to analyse if the extracts were inducing apoptosis using annexin V analysis. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms by which apoptosis was induced was analysed by qPCR, western blots. All three extracts exhibited anticancer activity with the most cytotoxic being methanol extract. p53 expression was significantly increased in treated cells that correlated with increased caspase activity.

We also examined relations between blood dose and dose rate, RIFs, and platelet counts. Methods: Venous blood samples were obtained from 48 patients subjected to 177Lu-labeled radioligand therapy (177Lu-DOTATOC, 26; 177Lu-PSMA, 22) to quantify blood lymphocyte RIFs and blood activity concentrations at various time points, including baseline (before injection) and postinjection readings (5 min, 30 min, 4 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h). Absorbed doses and dose rates to blood were derived from sequentially assessed blood activity concentrations and γ-camera imaging. Platelet levels in routine blood tests were monitored for 3 d after injection to assess responses. Results: RIF counts averaged 0.25 ± 0.15 at baseline. Postinjection RIF counts were significantly higher than baseline values, peaking at 5 min (average, 3.93 ± 2.51 min) and declining thereafter. Compared with RIF counts of 177Lu-DOTATOC, those of 177Lu-PSMA were significantly higher at 5 min after injection and significantly lower at 72 h after injection. These differences could not be fully explained by blood doses and dose rates, which were significantly higher for 177Lu-PSMA than for 177Lu-DOTATOC treatment at every time point. RIF counts overall correlated with dose rates across all time points (Pearson r = 0.78; P < 0.01) and with absorbed dose until 4 h after injection only (Pearson r = 0.42; P < 0.01). Declines in platelet concentration correlated significantly with RIFs at 72 h after injection (Pearson r = -0.34; P < 0.05). Conclusion: Although values generated by the currently used blood dosimetry model correlated with RIF counts, the difference observed in 177Lu-DOTATOC and 177Lu-PSMA treatment groups was unexplained. Significantly more RIFs were found in 177Lu-DOTATOC recipients by comparison, despite lower dose rates and blood doses, exposing a potential limitation.""","""['Philipp Ritt', 'Camille Jobic', 'Michael Beck', 'Christian Schmidkonz', 'Torsten Kuwert', 'Michael Uder', 'Michael Brand']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['DNA damage in blood leucocytes of prostate cancer patients during therapy with 177Lu-PSMA.', 'Analysis of 177Lu-DOTA-octreotate therapy-induced DNA damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with neuroendocrine tumors.', 'Enhancing Treatment Efficacy of 177Lu-PSMA-617 with the Conjugation of an Albumin-Binding Motif: Preclinical Dosimetry and Endoradiotherapy Studies.', '177Lu-PSMA Radioligand Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Third-line treatment and 177Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Individual radiosensitivity reflected by γ-H2AX and 53BP1 foci predicts outcome in PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy.', 'EANM dosimetry committee recommendations for dosimetry of 177Lu-labelled somatostatin-receptor- and PSMA-targeting ligands.']"""

We sought to derive a novel nomogram incorporating the platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) to predict LNI and compare its performance to validated preoperative risk nomograms in a cohort of men undergoing robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy at our institution.  Methods:   Our electronic health record was queried for patients who underwent robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy between 2013 and 2019. A bootstrapped multivariate logistic regression model was constructed for the predictors of LNI while adjusting for other covariates. Then, we used the derived logistic regression formula to estimate each patient's risk (%) for LNI. Individualized risks were also calculated using the following verified nomograms: Briganti-2012, Cagiannos, Godoy, and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Subsequently, we plotted the risks for our nomogram and the 4 verified nomograms into receiver operating characteristics curves. We reported the area under the curve (AUC) for each of the 5 nomograms and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI).  Results:   The cohort included 173 patients, of which 13.9% demonstrated LNI. LNI was associated with higher preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≥ 10 [odds ratio [OR] = 4.89; 95% confidence interval [CI] (1.42-16.83)], higher grade (WHO group ≥ 3)[19.21; (2.23-195.25)], and higher percentage of positive biopsy cores (≥60%) [3.38, (1.04-11.00)]. With every 30-unit increase in PLR the risk of LNI increased by 47%. The nomogram derived from our data had the highest AUC [(AUC 0.877; 95% CI (0.806-0.947)]. The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Briganti 2012 displayed almost congruent ability [0.836; 95% CI (0.758-0.915)] and [0.827; (0.752-0.902)] to identify patients with positive nodes in our cohort with perfect sensitivity and negative predictive value.  Conclusion:   The nomogram incorporating PLR demonstrated 94.7% sensitivity to predict LNI and avoided pelvic lymphadenectomy in half of the patients at a cut-off between 6.5% and 8.5%.

This study seeks to compare patient-reported functional outcomes after radical prostatectomy (RP) and postprostatectomy radiation as well as elucidate the timing of radiation to allow optimal recovery of function.  Methods:   The Comparative Effectiveness Analysis of Surgery and Radiation (CEASAR) study is a prospective, population-based, observational study of men with localized prostate cancer. Patient-reported sexual, urinary, and bowel functional outcomes were measured using the 26-item Expanded Prostate Index Composite at baseline and at 6, 12, 36, and 60 months after enrollment. Functional outcomes were compared among men undergoing RP alone, post-RP adjuvant radiation (RP + aRT), and post-RP salvage radiation (RP + sRT) using multivariable models controlling for baseline clinical, demographic, and functional characteristics.  Results:   Among 1,482 CEASAR participants initially treated with RP for clinically localized prostate cancer, 11.5% (N = 170) received adjuvant (aRT, N = 57) or salvage (sRT, N = 113) radiation. Men who received post-RP RT had worse scores in all domains (sexual function [-9.0, 95% confidence interval {-14.5, -3.6}, P < 0.001], incontinence [-8.8, {-14.0, -3.6}, P < 0.001], irritative voiding [-5.9, {-9.0, -2.8}, P < 0.001], bowel irritative [-3.5, {-5.8, -1.2}, P = 0.002], and hormonal function [-4.5, {-7.2, -1.7}, P = 0.001]) compared to RP alone at 5 years of follow-up. Compared to men treated with RP alone in an adjusted linear model, sRT was associated with significantly worse scores in all functional domains. aRT was associated with significantly worse incontinence, urinary irritation, and hormonal function domain scores compared to RP alone at 5 years of follow-up. On multivariable modeling, RT administered approximately 24 months after RP was associated with the smallest decline in sexual domain score, with an adjusted mean decrease of 8.85 points (95% confidence interval [-19.8, 2.1]) from post-RP, pre-RT baseline.  Conclusions:   In men with localized prostate cancer, post-RP RT was associated with significantly worse sexual, urinary, and bowel function domain scores at 5 years compared to RP alone. Radiation delayed for approximately 24 months after RP may be optimal for preserving erectile function compared to radiation administered closer to the time of RP.""","""['Heather L Huelster', 'Aaron A Laviana', 'Daniel D Joyce', 'Li-Ching Huang', 'Zhiguo Zhao', 'Tatsuki Koyama', 'Karen E Hoffman', 'Ralph Conwill', 'Michael Goodman', 'Ann S Hamilton', 'Xiao-Cheng Wu', 'Lisa E Paddock', 'Antoinette Stroup', 'Matthew Cooperberg', 'Mia Hashibe', ""Brock B O'Neil"", 'Sherrie H Kaplan', 'Sheldon Greenfield', 'David F Penson', 'Daniel A Barocas']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Effect of Prostate Cancer Severity on Functional Outcomes After Localized Treatment: Comparative Effectiveness Analysis of Surgery and Radiation Study Results.', 'Association Between Radiation Therapy, Surgery, or Observation for Localized Prostate Cancer and Patient-Reported Outcomes After 3 Years.', 'Patient-Reported Outcomes Through 5 Years for Active Surveillance, Surgery, Brachytherapy, or External Beam Radiation With or Without Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Adjuvant radiotherapy following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Adjuvant and Salvage Radiotherapy after Radical Prostatectomy in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Results of Adjustable Trans-Obturator Male System in Patients with Prostate Cancer Treated with Prostatectomy and Radiotherapy: A Multicenter Study.', 'WWOX Polymorphisms as Predictors of the Biochemical Recurrence of Localized Prostate Cancer after Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

Speckle-type pox virus and zinc finger protein (SPOP), the most frequently mutated gene in PCa, functions as a tumor suppressor via degradation of cancer-promoting substrates. However, its upstream regulation in PCa metastasis remains poorly determined. Here, in a Snail-induced metastatic PCa model, we observed an accelerated degradation of SPOP protein in cells, which is crucial for the PCa migration and activation of the AKT signaling pathway. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that binding to Snail promoted SPOP ubiquitination and degradation. Moreover, the bric-a-brac/tramtrack/broad complex (BTB) domain of SPOP is turned out to be essential for Snail-mediated SPOP degradation. Thus, our findings reveal a post-translational level regulation of SPOP expression that facilitates the metastasis of PCa cells.""","""['Wei Lv', 'Mengxi Huan', 'Wenjie Yang', 'Yang Gao', 'Ke Wang', 'Shan Xu', 'Mengzhao Zhang', 'Jianbin Ma', 'Xinyang Wang', 'Yule Chen', 'Lei Li']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['SPOP in Cancer: Phenomena, Mechanisms and Its Role in Therapeutic Implications.', 'SPOP promotes CDCA5 degradation to regulate prostate cancer progression via the AKT pathway.', 'Dysregulation of INF2-mediated mitochondrial fission in SPOP-mutated prostate cancer.', 'TRIM28 protects TRIM24 from SPOP-mediated degradation and promotes prostate cancer progression.', 'The diverse roles of SPOP in prostate cancer and kidney cancer.', 'SPOP in Cancer: Phenomena, Mechanisms and Its Role in Therapeutic Implications.', 'Insights of RKIP-Derived Suppression of Prostate Cancer.']"""

However, analytical stopping-power-ratio (SPR) estimation methods have limitations in resolving the influence from the beam-hardening artifact, i.e. CT number variation of the same object scanned under different imaging conditions, such as different patient size and location in the field-of-view (FOV). We present a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based framework to estimate proton SPR that accounts for patient geometry variation and addresses CT number variation. The proposed framework was tested on both prostate and head-and-neck (HN) patient datasets. Simulated CT images were used in order to have a well-defined ground-truth SPR for evaluation. Two training scenarios were evaluated: training with patient CT images (ideal scenario) and training with computational phantoms (realistic scenario). For the training in ideal scenario, computational phantoms were created based on 120 kVp patient CT images using a custom-defined density and material translation curve. Then, 80 kVp and 150 kVp Sn DECT image pairs were obtained using ray-tracing simulation, and their corresponding SPR was calculated from the known density and elemental compositions. For the training in realistic scenario, computational phantoms were created based on the geometry of calibration phantoms. For both scenarios, evaluation was performed on the phantoms created from patient CT images. Compared to a conventional parametric model, U-net trained with computational phantoms (realistic scenario) reduced the SPR estimation uncertainty (95th percentile) of the prostate patient from 1.10% to 0.71%, and HN patient from 2.11% to 1.20%. With the U-net trained with patient images (ideal scenario) uncertainty values were 0.32% and 0.42% for prostate and HN patients, respectively. These results suggest that CNN has great potential to improve the accuracy of SPR estimation in proton therapy by incorporating individual patient geometry information.""","""['H Hc Lee', 'Y K Park', 'X Duan', 'X Jia', 'S Jiang', 'M Yang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Towards subpercentage uncertainty proton stopping-power mapping via dual-energy CT: Direct experimental validation and uncertainty analysis of a statistical iterative image reconstruction method.', 'Optimal energy selection for proton stopping-power-ratio estimation using dual-energy CT-based monoenergetic imaging.', 'Experimental implementation of a joint statistical image reconstruction method for proton stopping power mapping from dual-energy CT data.', 'Dual- and multi-energy CT for particle stopping-power estimation: current state, challenges and potential.', 'Status and innovations in pre-treatment CT imaging for proton therapy.', 'Improving radiation physics, tumor visualisation, and treatment quantification in radiotherapy with spectral or dual-energy CT.']"""

The studies on the molecular mechanism of action demonstrated that these unsymmetrical dimers significantly responded to the presence of G-quadruplex not to dsDNA. Structure-activity relationships for UAs potency to G-quadruplex stabilization indicated that thermal stability of this drug-G-quadruplex complex depended not only on the structure of heterocyclic rings, but also on the properties of dialkylamino chains of the ring linkers. In conclusion, the presented studies identified the new group of effective antitumor agents against solid human tumors, particularly pancreatic Panc-1, BxPC-3 and Mia-Pa-Ca-2 and strongly indicated their distinctive interactions with DNA.

Currently, limited data exist regarding the optimal choice of chemotherapy for mCRPC after failing second generation hormone therapy. We sought to evaluate three common chemotherapy regimens in this setting.  Methods:   We retrospectively identified 150 mCRPC patients with disease progression on enzalutamide or abiraterone. Of these 150 patients, 92 patients were chemo-naïve while 58 patients had previously received docetaxel chemotherapy before being started on second HT. After failing second HT, 90 patients were assigned for docetaxel-alone (group A), 33 patients received carboplatin plus docetaxel (group B), while 27 patients received cabazitaxel-alone (Group C). A favorable response was defined by more than or equal to 50% reduction in prostate-specific antigen from the baseline level after a complete course of chemotherapy. Survival outcomes were assessed for 30-month overall survival.  Results:   Patients in group (B) were 2.6 times as likely to have a favorable response compared to patients in group (A) (OR = 2.625, 95%CI: 1.15-5.99) and almost three times compared to patients in group (C) (OR = 2.975, 95%CI: 1.04-8.54) (P = .0442). 30-month overall survival was 70.7%, 38.9% and 30.3% for group (B), (A), and (C), respectively (P = .008). We report a Hazard Ratio of 3.1 (95% CI, 1.31-7.35; P = .0037) between patients in group (A) versus those in group (B) and a Hazard Ratio of 4.18 (95% CI, 1.58-11.06; P = .0037) between patients in group (C) compared to those in group (B) CONCLUSION: This data demonstrates improved response and overall survival in treatment-refractory mCRPC with a chemotherapy regimen of docetaxel plus carboplatin when compared to docetaxel alone or cabazitaxel alone.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play an important role in the occurrence and development of PRAD, however, the prognostic biomarkers associated with CSC features have not been identified in PRAD. MATERIAL AND METHODS In order to identify the prognostic stemness-related genes (SRGs) of PRAD, the RNA sequencing data of patients with PRAD were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases. The mRNA expression-based stemness index (mRNAsi) and the differential expressed genes (DEGs) were evaluated and identified. The associations between the mRNAsi and tumorigenesis, overall survival (OS), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value, and Gleason score were also established by nonparametric test and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The SRGs were identified as the overlapped DEGs of PRAD-associated DEGs and the mRNAsi-associated DEGs. Based on the prognostic SRGs, the predict model was constructed. Its accuracy was tested by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve and the risk score. RESULTS A total of 6005 PRAD-associated DEGs and 2462 mRNAsi-associated DEGs were identified. The mRNAsi was significantly upregulated in PRAD and associated with the PSA value and Gleason score. A total of 1631 SRGs were identified, with 36 prognostic SRGs screened by the univariate Cox analysis. Based on the prognostic SRGs, the predict model was constructed with the AUC of 0.986. Moreover, the risk score of the model was proved to be an independent prognostic factor, indicating its significant applicability. CONCLUSIONS Our data demonstrate the mRNAsi as a reliable index for the tumorigenesis, PSA value, and Gleason score of PRAD.

Patients who are diagnosed with localized prostate cancer and treated with radical prostatectomy often respond well to therapy. The current standard therapy for prostate cancer involves maximal surgical resection, followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Clarifying the molecular mechanism of tumor proliferation and recurrence becomes more and more important for clinical therapies of prostate cancer.  Methods:   Quantitative Real-Time PCR and Western-blot were used in the detection of mRNA and protein expression. Lentivirus infection was used to overexpress or knockdown the target gene. Flow cytometry analysis was performed to test protein expression and apoptosis level. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify protein expression in tissue. Statistical differences between the two groups are evaluated by two-tailed t-tests. The comparison among multiple groups is performed by one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett's posttest. The statistical significance of the Kaplan-Meier survival plot is determined by log-rank analysis.  Results:   In this study, we identified that FOXM1 expression was significantly enriched in prostate cancer compared with normal tissue. Additionally, FOXM1 was functionally required for tumor proliferation and its expression was associated with poor prognosis in prostate cancer patients. Mechanically, FOXM1-dependent regulation of EZH2 is essential for proliferation and progression in prostate cancer.  Conclusion:   Taken together, our data suggest that oncogenic transcription factor FoxM1 is up-regulated in prostate cancer, suggesting that the growth of cancer cells may depend on FOXM1 activity. FOXM1 may serve as a clinical prognostic factor and a therapeutic target for prostate cancer.""","""['Juan-Hua Tian', 'Li-Jun Mu', 'Mei-Yu Wang', 'Jin Zeng', 'Qing-Zhi Long', 'Bin-Guan', 'Wen Wang', 'Yu-Mei Jiang', 'Xiao-Jing Bai', 'Yue-Feng Du']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Anticancer Agents Med Chem""","""['BUB1B Promotes Proliferation of Prostate Cancer via Transcriptional Regulation of MELK.', 'microRNA-877-5p exerts tumor-suppressive functions in prostate cancer through repressing transcription of forkhead box M1.', 'Transcription factor FoxM1 is the downstream target of c-Myc and contributes to the development of prostate cancer.', 'Regulation of the master regulator FOXM1 in cancer.', 'FOXM1: A Multifunctional Oncoprotein and Emerging Therapeutic Target in Ovarian Cancer.', 'The Role of Polo-Like Kinase 1 in Regulating the Forkhead Box Family Transcription Factors.', 'FOXM1: A small fox that makes more tracks for cancer progression and metastasis.', 'ETS transcription factor ELF3 (ESE-1) is a cell cycle regulator in benign and malignant prostate.']"""

This poses the question of whether cancer treatments can be postponed or modified without compromising their efficacy, especially for highly curable cancers such as germ cell tumors (GCTs).  Materials and methods:   To depict the state-of-the-art management of GCTs during the COVID-19 pandemic, a survey including 26 questions was circulated by e-mail among the physicians belonging to three cooperative groups: (a) Italian Germ Cell Cancer Group; (b) European Reference Network-Rare Adult Solid Cancers, Domain G3 (rare male genitourinary cancers); and (c) Genitourinary Medical Oncologists of Canada. Percentages of agreement between Italian respondents (I) versus Canadian respondents (C), I versus European respondents (E), and E versus C were compared by using Fisher's exact tests for dichotomous answers and chi square test for trends for the questions with three or more options.  Results:   Fifty-three GCT experts responded to the survey: 20 Italian, 6 in other European countries, and 27 from Canada. Telemedicine was broadly used; there was high consensus to interrupt chemotherapy in COVID-19-positive patients (I = 75%, C = 55%, and E = 83.3%) and for use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor primary prophylaxis for neutropenia (I = 65%, C = 62.9%, and E = 50%). The main differences emerged regarding the management of stage I and stage IIA disease, likely because of cultural and geographical differences.  Conclusion:   Our study highlights the common efforts of GCT experts in Europe and Canada to maintain high standards of treatment for patients with GCT with few changes in their management during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Implications for practice:   Despite the chaos, disruptions, and fears fomented by the COVID-19 illness, oncology care teams in Italy, other European countries, and Canada are delivering the enormous promise of curative management strategies for patients with testicular cancer and other germ cell tumors. At the same time, these teams are applying safe and innovative solutions and sharing best practices to minimize frequency and intensity of patient contacts with thinly stretched health care capacity.""","""['Lucia Nappi', 'Margaret Ottaviano', 'Pasquale Rescigno', 'Marianna Tortora', 'Giuseppe L Banna', 'Giulia Baciarello', 'Umberto Basso', 'Christina Canil', 'Alessia Cavo', 'Maria Cossu Rocca', 'Piotr Czaykowski', 'Ugo De Giorgi', 'Xavier Garcia Del Muro', 'Marilena Di Napoli', 'Giuseppe Fornarini', 'Jourik A Gietema', 'Daniel Y C Heng', 'Sebastien J Hotte', 'Christian Kollmannsberger', 'Marco Maruzzo', 'Carlo Messina', 'Franco Morelli', 'Sasja Mulder', 'Craig Nichols', 'Franco Nolè', 'Christoph Oing', 'Teodoro Sava', 'Simona Secondino', 'Giuseppe Simone', 'Denis Soulieres', 'Bruno Vincenzi', 'Paolo A Zucali', 'Sabino De Placido', 'Giovannella Palmieri;Italian Germ Cell Cancer Group (IGG);ERN-EURACAN Domain G;Genitourinary Medical Oncologists of Canada (GUMOC)']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Oncologist""","""['Metastatic Mediastinal Germ-Cell Tumor and Concurrent COVID-19: When Chemotherapy Is Not Deferrable.', 'Impact of COVID-19 outbreak on cancer immunotherapy in Italy: a survey of young oncologists.', 'Genitourinary Medical Oncology Expert Opinion Survey Regarding Treatment Management in the COVID-19 Pandemic.', 'Gynaecologic cancer care during COVID-19 pandemic in India: a social media survey.', 'Telemedicine and current clinical practice trends in the COVID-19 pandemic.', 'Contralateral biopsies in patients with testicular germ cell tumours: patterns of care in Germany and recent data regarding prevalence and treatment of testicular intra-epithelial neoplasia.', 'Multidisciplinary approach for rare thoracic tumors during COVID-19 pandemic.', 'The Impact of COVID-19 Disease on Urology Practice.', 'Management of Breast Cancer Patients During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: The Experience From the Epicenter of China, Wuhan.', 'Systemic therapy and COVID19: Immunotherapy and chemotherapy.', 'Medical Liability in Cancer Care During COVID-19 Pandemic: Heroes or Guilty?']"""

Method:   We included all men in the Uppsala-Örebro health care region of Sweden who were PSA tested between 1 July 2012 and 30 June 2014. Information regarding previous PSA testing, prostate cancer diagnosis, socioeconomic situation, surgical procedures and prescribed medications were collected from population-wide registries to create the Uppsala-Örebro PSA cohort (UPSAC).

The background population used for comparison consisted of men 40 years or older, living in the Uppsala-Örebro region during this time period.  Results:   Of the adult male population in the region, 18.1% had undergone PSA testing. Among men over 85 years old 21% where PSA tested. In our cohort, 62.1% were repeat PSA testers. Of men with a PSA level ≤1µg/l 53.8% had undergone repeat testing. Prostate cancer was found in 2.7% and 4.8% of the repeat and single testers, respectively.  Conclusion:   Every fifth man in the male background population was PSA tested. Repeated PSA testing was common despite low PSA values. As repeated PSA testing was common, especially among older men who will not be included in organized testing, special measures to change the testing patterns in this group may be required.""","""['Anna Pia Enblad', 'Oskar Bergengren', 'Ove Andrén', 'Anders Larsson', 'Katja Fall', 'Eva Johansson', 'Hans Garmo', 'Anna Bill-Axelson']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Scand J Urol""","""['Opportunistic testing versus organized prostate-specific antigen screening: outcome after 18 years in the Göteborg randomized population-based prostate cancer screening trial.', 'Poor Follow-up After Elevated Prostate-specific Antigen Tests: A Population-based Cohort Study.', 'Association Between Antidiabetic Medications and Prostate-Specific Antigen Levels and Biopsy Results.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Population screening for prostate cancer and emerging concepts for young men.', 'Diagnostic activity impacts lifetime risk of prostate cancer diagnosis more strongly than life expectancy.', 'Modeling Disease Trajectories for Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Using Nationwide Population-based Data.', ""Men's experiences of receiving a prostate cancer diagnosis after opportunistic screening-A qualitative descriptive secondary analysis."", 'Mortality in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer-A long-term follow-up of a population-based real-world cohort.', 'A drug comorbidity index to predict mortality in men with castration resistant prostate cancer.']"""

We investigated the impact of early versus delayed ADT on survival outcomes in patients with non-metastatic, localized or locally advanced PCa who received radiation therapy (RT) following RP and later developed distant metastasis.  Materials and methods:   A retrospective analysis was performed on 69 patients with non-metastatic, localized or locally advanced PCa who received RT following RP and later developed distant metastasis between January 2006 and December 2012. Patients were stratified according to the level of PSA at which ADT was administered (<2 ng/mL vs. ≥2 ng/mL). Study endpoints were progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)-free survival and cancer-specific survival (CSS).  Results:   Patients were stratified according to the criteria of 2 ng/mL of PSA at which ADT was administered, based on the Youden sensitivity analysis. Delayed ADT at PSA ≥2 ng/mL was an independent prognosticator of cancer-specific mortality (p=0.047), and a marginally significant prognosticator of progression to CRPC (p=0.051). During the median follow-up of 81.0 (interquartile range 54.2-115.7) months, patients who received early ADT at PSA <2 ng/mL had significantly higher CSS rates compared to patients who received delayed ADT at PSA ≥2 ng/mL (p=0.002). Progression to CRPC-free survival was comparable between the two groups (p=0.331).

We hypothesized that the multi-scale tissue architecture (MSTA) analysis score would correlate with the aggressive PCa phenotype and could be used as a tool for risk assessment to improve the management of patients with favorable-risk PCa.  Materials and methods:   MSTA was evaluated in needle-biopsy samples from 115 patients with favorable-risk PCa, as defined by GG1 and GG2, a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of <10 ng/mL, a clinical stage of cT1c to cT2b, and general Gleason GG (GGG) and expert pathologist-assessed GG (EGG). Algorithms based on Voronoi diagrams were applied to all Feulgen-thionin-stained diagnostic areas. One hundred tissue architecture features were calculated and an MSTA score, a linear combination of the most discriminant features, was generated. Correlation of MSTA score with BCR and other clinical variables was investigated.  Results:   In a univariate regression model, EGG, clinical stage, and MSTA were significant predictors of BCR (respective p-values: 0.0016, 0.016, and 0.028). Survival analysis showed that patients with a high MSTA score were more likely to experience BCR than were patients with a low MSTA score (odds ratio, 2.9). Combining MSTA with GG assessment resulted in a significant stratification of risk for BCR.  Conclusions:   MSTA score could be used as an objective adjunct risk stratification tool to pathologist assessments and could improve the management of patients with favorable-risk PCa.""","""['Miha Pukl', 'Sarah Keyes', 'Mira Keyes', 'Martial Guillaud', 'Metka Volavšek']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Investig Clin Urol""","""['Clinical utility of percent prostate needle biopsy tissue with cancer cutpoints to risk stratify patients before radical prostatectomy.', 'Preoperative model for predicting prostate specific antigen recurrence after radical prostatectomy using percent of biopsy tissue with cancer, biopsy Gleason grade and serum prostate specific antigen.', 'Improved risk stratification for biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy using a novel risk group system based on prostate specific antigen density and biopsy Gleason score.', 'Comparison of the Biochemical Recurrence risk between Radical Prostatectomy and Brachytherapy in the treatment of low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer.', 'Markers and meaning of primary treatment failure.', 'Impact of Stain Normalization on Pathologist Assessment of Prostate Cancer: A Comparative Study.']"""

Both full-length AR and truncated AR-Vs require a functional N-terminal domain (NTD) for transcriptional activity thereby providing rationale for the development of ralaniten (EPI-002) as a first-in-class antagonist of the AR-NTD. Here, we evaluated the antitumor effect of a next-generation analog of ralaniten (EPI-7170) as a monotherapy or in combination with enzalutamide in prostate cancer cells that express AR-V7 that were resistant to enzalutamide. EPI-7170 had 8-9 times improved potency compared to ralaniten. Enzalutamide increased levels of AR-V7 and expression of its target genes. Knockdown of AR-V7 restored sensitivity to enzalutamide, indicating a role for AR-V7 in the mechanism of resistance. EPI-7170 inhibited expression of genes transcriptionally regulated by full-length AR and AR-V7. A combination of EPI-7170 and enzalutamide resulted in synergistic inhibition of proliferation of enzalutamide-resistant cells that was consistent with results from cell cycle and clonogenic assays. In addition, this drug enhanced the antitumor effect of enzalutamide in enzalutamide-resistant CRPC preclinical models. Thus, a combination therapy targeting both the NTD and LBD of AR, and thereby blocking both full-length AR and AR-Vs, has potential for the treatment of enzalutamide-resistant CRPC.""","""['Yukiyoshi Hirayama', 'Teresa Tam', 'Kunzhong Jian', 'Raymond J Andersen', 'Marianne D Sadar']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Oncol""","""['Isolation and characterization of castration-resistant prostate cancer LNCaP95 clones.', 'Cotargeting Androgen Receptor Splice Variants and mTOR Signaling Pathway for the Treatment of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Niclosamide inhibits androgen receptor variants expression and overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor variant-driven prostate cancer: clinical implications and therapeutic targeting.', 'Targeting persistent androgen receptor signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A compendium of Androgen Receptor Variant 7 target genes and their role in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Small molecules targeting the disordered transactivation domain of the androgen receptor induce the formation of collapsed helical states.', 'Hybrid Androgen Receptor Inhibitors Outperform Enzalutamide and EPI-001 in in\u2005vitro Models of Prostate Cancer Drug Resistance.', 'The Crucial Role of AR-V7 in Enzalutamide-Resistance of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Drugging the Undruggable: Targeting the N-Terminal Domain of Nuclear Hormone Receptors.']"""

Methods:   This was a single-center retrospective case series conducted at a hospital in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. We reviewed the medical and surgical records of patients who underwent TURP between January 2012 and December 2017.  Results:   The final sample comprised 513 patients, with a mean age of 70.8 years. Bladder lesions were identified during TURP in 109 (21.2%) of the patients, and 90 of those lesions were submitted for pathological examination. The most common macroscopic finding was bullous edema, which was seen in 57 (63.3%) of the 90 lesions examined. The pathological analysis revealed chronic cystitis in 61 lesions (67.8%) and malignant lesions in 16 (17.8%). Of the 57 lesions described as bullous edema, 5 (8.8%) were found to be malignant.  Conclusions:   Alterations in the bladder mucosa appear to be more common among elderly patients who use an indwelling urinary catheter for a prolonged period and among patients with recurrent urinary tract infections. In addition, the risk of a bladder lesion being malignant is apparently higher in current and former smokers than in never smokers. Our findings suggest that at-risk patients should undergo biopsy or resection of incidental bladder lesions even if those lesions seem to be benign, due to the low level of agreement between the visual analysis and the pathological examination.""","""['Rafael de Cunto Romero', 'Wagner A Franca', 'Cristiane B Dias', 'Conrado G Pascini', 'Estevão C Amin', 'Luis A S Rios']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Combined cystolithotomy and transurethral resection of prostate: best management of infravesical obstruction and massive or multiple bladder stones.', 'A randomized trial comparing holmium laser enucleation of the prostate with transurethral resection of the prostate for the treatment of bladder outlet obstruction secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia in large glands (40 to 200 grams).', 'Glomerulation observed during transurethral resection of the prostate for patients with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia is a common finding but no predictor of clinical outcome.', 'A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Functional Outcomes and Complications Following Transurethral Procedures for Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Resulting from Benign Prostatic Obstruction: An Update.', 'Monopolar transurethral resection of the big prostate, experience at Prince Hussein Bin Abdullah Urology Center.']"""

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT as a triage tool for prostate biopsy (PSMA-TB) and compare with transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (TRUS-GB) for the diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa).  Methods:   This single-centre study randomly allocated 120 patients with elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels (> 4 ng/ml) to PSMA-PET or TRUS group. Patients with PSMA-avid lesions (SUVmax ≥ 8.0) underwent PSMA-TB via a single-puncture percutaneous transgluteal approach (n = 25), whilst patients with negative PSMA-PET underwent systematic TRUS-GB (n = 35). All patients in the TRUS group underwent TRUS-GB directly (n = 60).  Results:   PCa and csPCa were detected in 26/60 (43.3%) and 24/60 (40.0%) patients in the PSMA-PET group and 19/60 (31.6%) and 15/60 (25.0%) in the TRUS group, respectively. In the PSMA-PET group, the detection rate of PCa and csPCa were significantly higher in PSMA-PET-positive than negative patients (PCa, 23/25 (92.0%) vs 3/35 (8.6%), P < 0.01; csPCa, 22/25 (88.0%) vs 2/35 (5.7%), P < 0.01). PSMA-TB detected significantly more PCa and csPCa than TRUS-GB in the TRUS controls (PCa, 21/25 (84.0%) vs 19/60 (31.6%), P < 0.01; csPCa, 20/25 (80.0%) vs 15/60 (25.0%), P < 0.01). PSMA-PET detected significantly more cases of csPCa amongst patients with PSA 4.0-20.0 ng/ml than TRUS (27.02% vs 8.82%, P < 0.05). No haematuria, urinary retention or pelvic infection was observed after PSMA-TB compare with TRUS-GB.  Conclusions: 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT is a feasible imaging technique that may serve as a triage tool for prostate biopsy, and may improve the detection rate of csPCa compared with TRUS-GB, especially in patients with serum PSA 4.0-20.0 ng/ml.""","""['Le-Le Zhang#', 'Wen-Cheng Li#', 'Zheng Xu#', 'Nan Jiang', 'Shi-Ming Zang', 'Lu-Wei Xu', 'Wen-Bing Huang', 'Feng Wang', 'Hong-Bin Sun']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['68Ga-PSMA PET/CT Combined with PET/Ultrasound-Guided Prostate Biopsy Can Diagnose Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer in Men with Previous Negative Biopsy Results.', 'Establishment and prospective validation of an SUVmax cutoff value to discriminate clinically significant prostate cancer from benign prostate diseases in patients with suspected prostate cancer by 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT: a real-world study.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Diagnostic Performance and Clinical Impact of PSMA PET/CT versus mpMRI in Patients with a High Suspicion of Prostate Cancer and Previously Negative Biopsy: A Prospective Trial (PROSPET-BX).', 'Current state of prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/CT imaging-targeted biopsy techniques for detection of clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Up-to-Date Imaging and Diagnostic Techniques for Prostate Cancer: A Literature Review.', 'The Application of Radiolabeled Targeted Molecular Probes for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', '68Ga-PSMA PET/CT and Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: Which SUVmax Value?', 'A Systematic Review of the Variability in Performing and Reporting Intraprostatic Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography in Primary Staging Studies.', 'Radiotheranostics in advanced prostate cancer: Current and future directions.']"""

Our aim was to evaluate surgical scar appearance based on operative approach to RP using a validated tool for evaluating psychosocial impact of scar appearance. Methods: Men between the ages of 45 and 80 were surveyed on an online crowdsourcing platform. Well-healed surgical scars after open, multiport (MP) robotic (transperitoneal and extraperitoneal), and single-port (SP) robotic RP were digitally rendered on stock photos to control for patient appearance. Respondents evaluated images using the SCAR-Q© psychosocial impact domain. Additionally, different RP scars were ranked by appearance and assigned 10-point appearance scores. Results: Two hundred thirty-four surveys were included for analysis (completion rate 84.2%). The median age was 54 (IQR: 49-61) and 35% (85/234) had previous abdominal surgery, of which 45% (38/85) was robotic or laparoscopic. SP scars had better psychosocial impact scores (median 100 out of 100 vs 69 and 58) than MP and open, respectively (both p < 0.001). SP scars were consistently ranked higher by appearance (median rank 1, IQR: 1-1) than MP (2, IQR: 2-3) and open (3, IQR: 3-4) (p < 0.001). SP without assistant port had the highest appearance score (median 9, IQR: 7-9) among all scars (p < 0.001). Conclusion: SP scars scored highest on psychosocial impact and were consistently ranked highest in appearance.

Radiolabeled GRPR antagonists, besides being safer for human use, have often shown higher tumor uptake and faster background clearance than agonists. We herein compared the biological profiles of the GRPR-antagonist-based radiotracers [99mTc]Tc-[N4-PEGx-DPhe6,Leu-NHEt13]BBN(6-13) (N4: 6-(carboxy)-1,4,8,11-tetraazaundecane; PEG: polyethyleneglycol): (i) [99mTc]Tc-DB7 (x = 2), (ii) [99mTc]Tc-DB13 (x = 3), and (iii) [99mTc]Tc-DB14 (x = 4), in GRPR-positive cells and animal models. The impact of in situ neprilysin (NEP)-inhibition on in vivo stability and tumor uptake was also assessed by treatment of mice with phosphoramidon (PA). Methods: The GRPR affinity of DB7/DB13/DB14 was determined in PC-3 cell membranes, and cell binding of the respective [99mTc]Tc-radioligands was assessed in PC-3 cells. Each of [99mTc]Tc-DB7, [99mTc]Tc-DB13, and [99mTc]Tc-DB14 was injected into mice without or with PA coinjection and 5 min blood samples were analyzed by HPLC. Biodistribution was conducted at 4 h postinjection (pi) in severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) mice bearing PC-3 xenografts without or with PA coinjection. Results: DB7, -13, and -14 displayed single-digit nanomolar affinities for GRPR. The uptake rates of [99mTc]Tc-DB7, [99mTc]Tc-DB13, and [99mTc]Tc-DB14 in PC-3 cells was comparable and consistent with a radioantagonist profile. The radiotracers were found to be ≈70% intact in mouse blood and >94% intact after coinjection of PA. Treatment of mice with PA enhanced tumor uptake. Conclusions: The present study showed that increase of PEG-spacer length in the [99mTc]Tc-DB7-[99mTc]Tc-DB13-[99mTc]Tc-DB14 series had little effect on GRPR affinity, specific uptake in PC-3 cells, in vivo stability, or tumor uptake. A significant change in in vivo stability and tumor uptake was observed only after treatment of mice with PA, without compromising the favorably low background radioactivity levels.""","""['Panagiotis Kanellopoulos', 'Emmanouil Lymperis', 'Aikaterini Kaloudi', 'Marion de Jong', 'Eric P Krenning', 'Berthold A Nock', 'Theodosia Maina']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Molecules""","""['Preclinical and first clinical experience with the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor-antagonist ⁶⁸GaSB3 and PET/CT.', '99mTcTc-HYNIC-RM2: A potential SPECT probe targeting GRPR expression in prostate cancers.', '99mTc radiotracers based on human GRP(18-27): synthesis and comparative evaluation.', '99mTc-labeled N40,Pro1,Tyr4bombesin.', '99mTc(v)O-Gly-Gly-Cys-Orn-Orn-Orn-Bombesin2-14.', 'The Chemical Scaffold of Theranostic Radiopharmaceuticals: Radionuclide, Bifunctional Chelator, and Pharmacokinetics Modifying Linker.', 'Radiolabeled Bombesin Analogs.', '99mTcTc-DB15 in GRPR-Targeted Tumor Imaging with SPECT: From Preclinical Evaluation to the First Clinical Outcomes.', 'Advances in Development of Radiometal Labeled Amino Acid-Based Compounds for Cancer Imaging and Diagnostics.', 'Preclinical Evaluation of 99mTc-Labeled GRPR Antagonists maSSS/SES-PEG2-RM26 for Imaging of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   This was a population-based retrospective cohort study of men aged 50-80 years old in Ontario, Canada, between 2008 and 2016. We identified 26 742 patients with prostate cancer, a Gleason grade score ≤7, and an index prostate-specific antigen ≤10 ng/mL.

Methods:   The Dr. Answer AI was developed based on a clinical outcome prediction model, with a user-friendly interface. We used 7,128 clinical data of prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy from three hospitals. An outcome prediction model was developed to calculate the probability of occurrence of 1) tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) staging, 2) extracapsular extension, 3) seminal vesicle invasion, and 4) lymph node metastasis. Random forest and k-nearest neighbors algorithms were used, and the proposed system was compared with previous algorithms.  Results:   Random forest exhibited good performance for TNM staging (recall value: 76.98%), while k-nearest neighbors exhibited good performance for extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, and lymph node metastasis (80.24%, 98.67%, and 95.45%, respectively).

Seed positions can be reconstructed after in-vivo implantation using a high-resolution pinhole gamma camera inserted into the patient rectum. The obtained data is a set of 2D projections of the seeds on the image plane. The 3D reconstruction algorithm requires the identification of the seed's centre of mass. This work presents the development and techniques adopted to build an algorithm that provides the means for fully automatic seed centre of mass identification and 3D position reconstruction for real-time applications. The algorithm presented uses a local feature detector, speeded up robust features, to perform detection of brachytherapy seed 2D projections from images, allowing for robust seed identification. Initial results have been obtained with datasets of 30, 96 and 98 I-125 brachytherapy seeds implanted into a prostate gel phantom. It can detect 97% of seeds and correctly match 97% of seeds. The average overall computation time of 2.75 s per image and improved reconstruction accuracy of 22.87% for the 98 seed dataset was noted. Elimination processes for initial false positive detection removal have shown to be extremely effective, resulting in a 99.9% reduction of false positives, and when paired with automatic frame alignment and subtraction procedures allows for the effective removal of excess counts generated by previously implanted needles.

Multivariable regressions predicting cancer diagnosis included sociodemographic characteristics, tobacco use, body mass index, access to care indicators, and disability status.  Results:   Persons with preexisting disability had significantly higher rates of cancer (ranging from 0.40 [SE, 0.05] for ovarian to 3.38 [0.14] for prostate) than did those without disability (0.20 [0.02] and 1.26 [0.04] for the same cancers; all P<.0001). Multivariable analyses found strong associations of preexisting MD and CAL with colorectal cancer, with adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2-1.9) and 1.9 (1.5-2.4), respectively. For non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the aOR for CAL was 1.5 (1.1-2.1). For prostate cancer, aORs for MD were 1.2 (1.0-1.3) and 1.1 (1.0-1.3) for CAL. Using cross-sectional survey data, we could only identify statistical associations, not causality.  Conclusions:   Our population-based analyses suggest that persons with disability may constitute a high-risk population, with higher cancer incidence. Optimizing appropriate screening and fully investigating new signs and symptoms are therefore critical for patients with disability.""","""['Lisa I Iezzoni', 'Sowmya R Rao', 'Nicole D Agaronnik', 'Areej El-Jawahri']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Natl Compr Canc Netw""","""['Associations Between Disability and Breast or Cervical Cancers, Accounting for Screening Disparities.', 'Mobility problems and perceptions of disability by self-respondents and proxy respondents.', 'Trends in colorectal cancer screening over time for persons with\xa0and\xa0without chronic disability.', 'Racial and ethnic disparities in cancer screening: the importance of foreign birth as a barrier to care.', 'Trends in mammography over time for women with and without chronic disability.', 'Cancer Disparities Experienced by People with Disabilities.', 'Use of Accessible Weight Scales and Examination Tables/Chairs for Patients with Significant Mobility Limitations by Physicians Nationwide.', 'Exploring the Process of Cancer Care for Patients With Pre-Existing Mobility Disability.', 'Perspectives of Patients with Pre-existing Mobility Disability on the Process of Diagnosing Their Cancer.', 'Associations Between Disability and Breast or Cervical Cancers, Accounting for Screening Disparities.']"""

The purpose of this study was to evaluate in a multicenter dataset the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI) detection system with attention mapping compared with multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) interpretation in the detection of prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS. MRI examinations from five institutions were included in this study and were evaluated by nine readers. In the first round, readers evaluated mpMRI studies using the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2. After 4 weeks, images were again presented to readers along with the AI-based detection system output. Readers accepted or rejected lesions within four AI-generated attention map boxes. Additional lesions outside of boxes were excluded from detection and categorization. The performances of readers using the mpMRI-only and AI-assisted approaches were compared. RESULTS. The study population included 152 case patients and 84 control patients with 274 pathologically proven cancer lesions. The lesion-based AUC was 74.9% for MRI and 77.5% for AI with no significant difference (p = 0.095). The sensitivity for overall detection of cancer lesions was higher for AI than for mpMRI but did not reach statistical significance (57.4% vs 53.6%, p = 0.073). However, for transition zone lesions, sensitivity was higher for AI than for MRI (61.8% vs 50.8%, p = 0.001). Reading time was longer for AI than for MRI (4.66 vs 4.03 minutes, p < 0.001). There was moderate interreader agreement for AI and MRI with no significant difference (58.7% vs 58.5%, p = 0.966). CONCLUSION. Overall sensitivity was only minimally improved by use of the AI system. Significant improvement was achieved, however, in the detection of transition zone lesions with use of the AI system at the cost of a mean of 40 seconds of additional reading time.""","""['Sherif Mehralivand', 'Stephanie A Harmon', 'Joanna H Shih', 'Clayton P Smith', 'Nathan Lay', 'Burak Argun', 'Sandra Bednarova', 'Ronaldo Hueb Baroni', 'Abdullah Erdem Canda', 'Karabekir Ercan', 'Rossano Girometti', 'Ercan Karaarslan', 'Ali Riza Kural', 'Andrei S Purysko', 'Soroush Rais-Bahrami', 'Victor Martins Tonso', 'Cristina Magi-Galluzzi', 'Jennifer B Gordetsky', 'Ricardo Silvestre E Silva Macarenco', 'Maria J Merino', 'Berrak Gumuskaya', 'Yesim Saglican', 'Stefano Sioletic', 'Anne Y Warren', 'Tristan Barrett', 'Leonardo Bittencourt', 'Mehmet Coskun', 'Chris Knauss', 'Yan Mee Law', 'Ashkan A Malayeri', 'Daniel J Margolis', 'Jamie Marko', 'Derya Yakar', 'Bradford J Wood', 'Peter A Pinto', 'Peter L Choyke', 'Ronald M Summers', 'Baris Turkbey']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""AJR Am J Roentgenol""","""['Urological Oncology: Prostate Cancer.', 'A Multireader Exploratory Evaluation of Individual Pulse Sequence Cancer Detection on Prostate Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).', 'Deep-Learning-Based Artificial Intelligence for PI-RADS Classification to Assist Multiparametric Prostate MRI Interpretation: A Development Study.', 'Intra- and interreader reproducibility of PI-RADSv2: A multireader study.', 'Artificial Intelligence in Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: Where Do We Stand in 2021?', 'Machine learning and multiparametric MRI for early diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Research progress on deep learning in magnetic resonance imaging-based diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer: a review on the current status and perspectives.', 'Characterization of high-grade prostate cancer at multiparametric MRI: assessment of PI-RADS version 2.1 and version 2 descriptors across 21 readers with varying experience (MULTI study).', 'Unassisted Clinicians Versus Deep Learning-Assisted Clinicians in Image-Based Cancer Diagnostics: Systematic Review With Meta-analysis.', 'A review of artificial intelligence in prostate cancer detection on imaging.', 'Artificial intelligence in oncologic imaging.']"""

PI-RADS version 2.1 (v2.1) introduced a number of key changes to the assessment of transition zone (TZ) lesions. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to evaluate interobserver agreement and diagnostic accuracy for detecting TZ prostate cancer (PCa) and clinically significant PCa (csPCa) by use of PI-RADS v2 and PI-RADS v2.1 among radiologists with different levels of experience. METHODS. This retrospective study included 355 biopsy-naïve patients who from January 2017 to March 2020 underwent prostate MRI that showed a TZ lesion and underwent subsequent biopsy. PCa was diagnosed in 93 patients (International Society of Urological Pathology [ISUP] grade group 1, n = 34; ISUP grade group ≥ 2, n = 59) and non-cancerous lesions in 262 patients. Five radiologists with varying experience in prostate MRI scored lesions using PI-RADS v2 and PI-RADS v2.1 in sessions separated by at least 4 weeks. Interobserver agreement was evaluated with kappa and Kendall W statistics. ROC curve analysis was used to evaluate performance in detection of TZ PCa and csPCa. RESULTS. Interobserver agreement among all readers was higher for PI-RADS v2.1 than for PI-RADS v2 (mean weighted κ = 0.700 vs 0.622; Kendall W = 0.805 vs 0.728; p = .03). The pooled AUC values for detecting TZ PCa and csPCa were higher among all readers using PI-RADS v2.1 (0.866 vs 0.827 for TZ PCa; 0.929 vs 0.899 for TZ csPCa; p < .001). For detecting TZ PCa, the pooled sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 86.9%, 79.4%, and 75.4% among all readers for PI-RADS v2.1 compared with 79.4%, 71.8%, and 73.8% for PI-RADS v2. For detecting TZ csPCa, the pooled sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 84.8%, 90.9%, and 89.9% among all readers for PI-RADS v2.1 compared with 81.4%, 89.9%, and 88.5% for PI-RADS v2. Reader 1, who had the least experience, had the lowest sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy (78.0%, 89.2%, and 87.3%). Reader 5, who had the most experience, had the highest sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy (88.1%, 92.9%, and 92.1%) in detecting csPCa. CONCLUSION. PI-RADS v2.1 had better interobserver agreement and diagnostic accuracy than PI-RADS v2 for evaluating TZ lesions. Reader experience continues to affect the performance of prostate MRI interpretation with PI-RADS v2.1. CLINICAL IMPACT. PI-RADS v2.1 is more accurate and reproducible than PI-RADS v2 for the diagnosis of TZ PCa.""","""['Chao-Gang Wei', 'Yue-Yue Zhang', 'Peng Pan', 'Tong Chen', 'Hong-Chang Yu', 'Guang-Cheng Dai', 'Jian Tu', 'Shuo Yang', 'Wen-Lu Zhao', 'Jun-Kang Shen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""AJR Am J Roentgenol""","""['PI-RADS Versions 2 and 2.1: Interobserver Agreement and Diagnostic Performance in Peripheral and Transition Zone Lesions Among Six Radiologists.', 'Prevalence of Prostate Cancer in PI-RADS Version 2.1 Transition Zone Atypical Nodules Upgraded by Abnormal DWI: Correlation With MRI-Directed TRUS-Guided Targeted Biopsy.', 'Prospective PI-RADS v2.1 Atypical Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Nodules With Marked Restricted Diffusion: Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer on Multiparametric MRI.', 'Interobserver Agreement and Accuracy in Interpreting mpMRI of the Prostate: a Systematic Review.', 'A meta-analysis of use of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2 (PI-RADS V2) with multiparametric MR imaging for the detection of prostate cancer.', 'Characterization of high-grade prostate cancer at multiparametric MRI: assessment of PI-RADS version 2.1 and version 2 descriptors across 21 readers with varying experience (MULTI study).', 'Are Urologists Ready for Interpretation of Multiparametric MRI Findings?

In recent years, multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) has been increasingly used in active surveillance and has shown great promise in patient selection and monitoring. This has been corroborated by publication of the Prostate Cancer Radiologic Estimation of Change in Sequential Evaluation (PRECISE) recommendations, which define the ideal reporting standards for mpMRI during active surveillance. The PRECISE recommendations include a system that assigns a score from 1 to 5 (the PRECISE score) for the assessment of radiologic change on serial mpMRI scans. PRECISE scores are defined as follows: a score of 3 indicates radiologic stability, a score of 1 or 2 denotes radiologic regression, and a score of 4 or 5 indicates radiologic progression. In the present study, we discuss current and future trends in the use of mpMRI during active surveillance and illustrate the natural history of prostate cancer on serial scans according to the PRECISE recommendations. We highlight how the ability to classify radiologic change on mpMRI with use of the PRECISE recommendations helps clinical decision making.""","""['Francesco Giganti', 'Alex Kirkham', 'Clare Allen', 'Shonit Punwani', 'Clément Orczyk', 'Mark Emberton', 'Caroline M Moore']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""AJR Am J Roentgenol""","""['Integration and Diagnostic Accuracy of 3T Nonendorectal coil Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging in the Context of Active Surveillance.', 'mpMRI Interpretation in Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer-An overview of the PRECISE score.', 'Changes in Magnetic Resonance Imaging Using the Prostate Cancer Radiologic Estimation of Change in Sequential Evaluation Criteria to Detect Prostate Cancer Progression for Men on Active Surveillance.', 'Latest Evidence on the Role of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Active Surveillance for Insignificant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'The Contemporary Role of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer.', 'Promoting the use of the PRECISE score for prostate MRI during active surveillance: results from the ESOR Nicholas Gourtsoyiannis teaching fellowship.', 'Schema and cancer detection rates for transperineal prostate biopsy templates: a review.', 'Abbreviated MR Protocols in Prostate MRI.', 'A narrative review of MRI acquisition for MR-guided-radiotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'Longitudinal evaluation of apparent diffusion coefficient values as a predictor of Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance reclassification.']"""

SUBJECTS AND METHODS. This HIPAA-compliant prospective study included 26 consecutive patients with localized high-risk prostate cancer (median age, 69.5 years [range, 53-81 years]; median prostate-specific antigen [PSA] level, 18.88 ng/mL [range, 1.03-20.00 ng/mL]) imaged with 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT and mpMRI. Images from PET/CT and mpMRI were evaluated separately, and suspicious areas underwent targeted biopsy. Lesion-based sensitivity and tumor detection rate were compared for PSMA PET and mpMRI. Standardized uptake value (SUV) and PSMA PET parameters were correlated with histopathology score, and uptake in tumor was compared with that in nonmalignant tissue. On a patient level, SUV and PSMA tumor volume were correlated with PSA density. RESULTS. Forty-four tumors (one in Gleason grade [GG] group 1, 12 in GG group 2, seven in GG group 3, nine in GG group 4, and 15 in GG group 5) were identified at histopathology. Sensitivity and tumor detection rate of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT and mpMRI were similar (PET/CT, 90.9% and 80%; mpMRI, 86.4% and 88.4%; p = 0.58/0.17). Total lesion PSMA and PSMA tumor volume showed a relationship with GG (τ = 0.27 and p = 0.08, τ = 0.30 and p = 0.06, respectively). Maximum SUV in tumor was significantly higher than that in nonmalignant tissue (p < 0.05). Tumor burden density moderately correlated with PSA density (r = 0.47, p = 0.01). Five true-positive tumors identified on 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT were not identified on mpMRI. CONCLUSION. In patients with high-risk prostate cancer, 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT is highly sensitive in detecting intraprostatic tumors and can detect tumors missed on mpMRI.

We investigated clinical (prostate-specific antigen density), MRI (PI-RADSv2 category of index lesion and zonal location, assessed as peripheral zone [PZ] or transition zone [TZ], of index lesion), and pathologic (tumor volume, tumor grade, and presence of extraprostatic extension) parameters. We analyzed Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the Cox proportional hazards model to assess 2-year biochemical failure-free survival and identify significant parameters associated with postoperative biochemical failure RESULTS. Biochemical failure occurred in 14.2% of patients (33/232). Two-year biochemical failure-free survival of patients with a PI-RADSv2 category 4 or 5 index lesion was 81.3%. For all patients, 2-year biochemical failure-free survival was different according to PI-RADSv2 category (category 4, 86.4%; category 5, 74.5%; p = 0.021) or zonal location (PZ, 75.3%; TZ, 96.8%; p = 0.003). Two-year biochemical failure-free survival in patients with category 4 lesions was similar in patients with PZ lesions (83.1%) and those with TZ lesions (100.0%) (p = 0.072), whereas it was different in patients with category 5 lesions (PZ, 62.0%; TZ, 95.0%; p = 0.002). In multivariate analysis, only zonal location of an index lesion on MRI was associated with biochemical failure (hazard ratio = 0.155; p = 0.012). CONCLUSION.

MATERIALS AND METHODS. The cohort in this retrospective, single-center study was derived from a database of 330 patients who underwent multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) followed by in-bore transrectal 3-T MRGB. Seventy-nine patients (mean [± SD] age, 64.1 ± 8.6 years) with prior negative transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy results and positive pre-MRGB mpMRI results (PI-RADS score ≥ 3) composed the final cohort. The rate of detection of PCa and csPCa (the latter of which was defined by a Gleason score of 3 + 4 or higher) was stratified according to updated PI-RADSv2.1 assessment. RESULTS. MRGB detected PCa in 36 patients (45.6%), 30 (83.3%) of whom had csPCa. The PI-RADSv2.1 score was a strong predictor (odds ratio, 3.97; 95% CI, 1.93-7.47) of csPCa detection. We found two benign transition zone target lesions that were downgraded from PI-RADSv2 category 3 to PI-RADSv2.1 category 2.

The purpose of this study was to calculate the negative predictive value of a prostate MRI study with a Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2 (PI-RADSv2) score of 1 (hereafter referred to as a PI-RADS 1 MRI study) and to explore the patient characteristics and MRI-based factors associated with an MRI study with false-negative results. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A total of 542 consecutive patients with a PI-RADS 1 MRI study obtained between January 2016 and July 2019 were retrospectively identified. Patient charts were examined to identify those patients who subsequently underwent systematic prostate biopsy within 1 year of undergoing MRI or at any later date if the biopsy was negative. Patient characteristics and MRI-specific factors were recorded. Two blinded radiologists evaluated the quality of the axial T2-weighted, DWI, and apparent diffusion coefficient sequences; measured the volume of the bladder, the prostate gland, and rectal gas; and determined whether the peripheral zone was avidly enhancing and whether low signal intensity was seen in 50% or more of the peripheral zone on T2-weighted images. Interobserver agreement was tested. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were built. RESULTS. A total of 150 patients (median age, 63 years; interquartile range, 56-70 years) were included. Of these patients, 19 (13%) had prostate cancer with a Gleason score of 3 + 4 or greater, yielding a negative predictive value of 87%. Both low T2 signal intensity in the peripheral zone and the prostate-specific antigen level were associated with a false-negative PI-RADS 1 assessment (odds ratio, 4.9 [95% CI, 1.6-14.9; p = 0.006] and 1.1 [95% CI, 1.0-1.2; p = 0.03], respectively). A cutoff prostate-specific antigen level of 3.97 ng/mL resulted in sensitivity and specificity of 89% and 21%, respectively. There was moderate interobserver agreement for low T2 signal intensity in the peripheral zone (κ coefficient = 0.75). CONCLUSION. Even among select patients who undergo subsequent biopsy because of a high clinical suspicion of prostate cancer, a PI-RADS 1 prostate MRI study has a high negative predictive value. A T2-hypointense peripheral zone and an elevated prostate-specific antigen level are significantly associated with a false-negative MRI study.""","""['Hong Y Ma', 'Firas S Ahmed', 'Lyndon Luk', 'Luis A Pina Martina', 'Sven Wenske', 'Hiram Shaish']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""AJR Am J Roentgenol""","""['Urological Oncology: Prostate Cancer.', 'Comparison of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System versions 1 and 2 for the Detection of Peripheral Zone Gleason Score 3 + 4 = 7 Cancers.', 'PI-RADS Version 2: Detection of Clinically Significant Cancer in Patients With Biopsy Gleason Score 6 Prostate Cancer.', 'Analysis of histological findings obtained combining US/mp-MRI fusion-guided biopsies with systematic US biopsies: mp-MRI role in prostate cancer detection and false negative.', 'PI-RADS 2.1 - Image Interpretation: The Most Important Updates and\xa0Their Clinical Implications.', 'The value of magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of prostate cancer in patients with previous negative biopsies and elevated prostate-specific antigen levels: a meta-analysis.', 'Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) v 2.1: Overview and Critical Points.', 'Combination of MRI prostate and 18F-DCFPyl PSMA PET/CT detects all clinically significant prostate cancers in treatment-naive patients: An international multicentre retrospective study.', 'Identifying Risk Factors for MRI-Invisible Prostate Cancer in Patients Undergoing Transperineal Saturation Biopsy.']"""

Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is the most frequently affected gene in CRC, but the prevalence and significance of its alterations in UrC is poorly understood. In addition, loss of phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) was shown to be associated with therapy resistance in CRC. Our primary aim was to assess specific genetic alterations including APC and PTEN in a large series of UrC samples in order to identify clinically significant genomic alterations. We analyzed a total of 40 UrC cases. Targeted 5-gene (APC, PTEN, DICER1, PRKAR1A, TSHR, WRN) panel sequencing was performed on the Illumina MiSeq platform (n = 34). In addition, ß-catenin (n = 38) and PTEN (n = 30) expressions were assessed by immunohistochemistry. APC and PTEN genes were affected in 15% (5/34) and 6% (2/34) of cases. Two of five APC alterations (p.Y1075*, p.K1199*) were truncating pathogenic mutations. One of the two PTEN variants was a pathogenic frameshift insertion (p.C211fs). In 29% (11/38) of samples, at least some weak nuclear ß-catenin immunostaining was detected and PTEN loss was observed in 20% (6/30) of samples. The low prevalence of APC mutations in UrC represents a characteristic difference to CRC. Based on APC and ß-catenin results, the Wnt pathway seems to be rarely affected in UrC. Considering the formerly described involvement of PTEN protein loss in anti-EGFR therapy-resistance its immunohistochemical testing may have therapeutic relevance.""","""['Nikolett Nagy', 'Henning Reis', 'Boris Hadaschik', 'Christian Niedworok', 'Orsolya Módos', 'Attila Szendrői', 'Krisztina Bíró', 'Thomas Hager', 'Thomas Herold', 'Jason Ablat', 'Peter C Black', 'Krzysztof Okon', 'Yuri Tolkach', 'Anita Csizmarik', 'Csilla Oláh', 'David Keresztes', 'Felix Bremmer', 'Nadine T Gaisa', 'Joerg Kriegsmann', 'Ilona Kovalszky', 'András Kiss', 'József Tímár', 'Marcell A Szász', 'Michael Rink', 'Margit Fisch', 'Péter Nyirády', 'Tibor Szarvas']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Pathol Oncol Res""","""['Wnt/β-catenin signal alteration and its diagnostic utility in basal cell adenoma and histologically similar tumors of the salivary gland.', 'Mutations of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, EGFR, and PIK3CA genes in urachal carcinoma: Occurence and prognostic significance.', 'Recurrent Mutations in APC and CTNNB1 and Activated Wnt/β-catenin Signaling in Intraductal Papillary Neoplasms of the Bile Duct: A Whole Exome Sequencing Study.', 'Biomarkers in Urachal Cancer and Adenocarcinomas in the Bladder: A Comprehensive Review Supplemented by Own Data.', 'Molecular Genetic Features of Primary Nonurachal Enteric-type Adenocarcinoma, Urachal Adenocarcinoma, Mucinous Adenocarcinoma, and Intestinal Metaplasia/Adenoma: Review of the Literature and Next-generation Sequencing Study.', 'Progress and prospects of targeted therapy and immunotherapy for urachal carcinoma.', 'Clinical sequencing identifies potential actionable alterations in a high rate of urachal and primary bladder adenocarcinomas.', 'Resveratrol inhibits the expression of RYR2 and is a potential treatment for pancreatic cancer.', 'Treatment Outcome of Different Chemotherapy in Patients With Relapsed or Metastatic Malignant Urachal Tumor.', 'Clinical, Pathological, and Prognostic Analysis of Urachal Carcinoma.']"""

Objective:   The objective of this work is to evaluate the age-related incidence and secular trends in gynecomastia in the general population.  Design:   An observational, 20-year national registry study was conducted.  Setting:   This population-based study used nationwide registry data.  Participants:   Participants included all Danish males (age 0-80 years) with a first-time diagnosis of gynecomastia.  Main outcome measures:   All Danish males (age 0-80 years) were followed up for incident diagnosis of gynecomastia in the Danish National Patient Registry from 1998 to 2017 using the International Codes of Diseases, 10th revision, and the Danish Health Care Classification System. Age-specific incidence rates were estimated. The hypothesis tested in this study was formulated prior to data collection.  Results:   Overall, a total 17 601 males (age 0-80 years) were registered with an incident diagnosis of gynecomastia within the 20-year study period, corresponding to 880 new cases per year and an average 20-year incidence of 3.4 per 10 000 men (age 0-80 years). The average annual incidence was 6.5/10 000 in postpubertal males age 16 to 20 years and 4.6/10 000 in males age 61 to 80 years, with a respective 5- and 11-fold overall increase in these 2 age groups over the 20-year period.  Conclusions:   The incidence of gynecomastia has dramatically increased over the last 20 years, implying that the endogenous or exogenous sex-steroid environment has changed, which is associated with other adverse health consequences in men such as an increased risk of prostate cancer, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, or cardiovascular disorders.""","""['Trine Koch', 'Elvira V Bräuner', 'Alexander S Busch', 'Martha Hickey', 'Anders Juul']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Clin Endocrinol Metab""","""['What Accounts for the Increased Incidence of Gynecomastia Diagnosis in Denmark from 1998-2017?', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Trends in the Incidence of Central Precocious Puberty and Normal Variant Puberty Among Children in Denmark, 1998 to 2017.', 'Italian cancer figures, report 2012: Cancer in children and adolescents.', 'Secular trends in the incidence and prevalence of gout in Denmark from 1995 to 2015: a nationwide register-based study.', 'Mortality and morbidity in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta in Denmark.', 'Case report on gynecomastia with ipsilateral recurrence of granulomatous lobular mastitis.', 'Increased Morbidity in Males Diagnosed With Gynecomastia: A Nationwide Register-based Cohort Study.', 'Risk\xa0factors\xa0on\xa0testicular\xa0function\xa0in\xa0adolescents.', 'Gynecomastia with rare granulomatous lobular mastitis: a case report and literature review.']"""

The therapeutic effects of radiotherapy are highly dependent on radiosensitivity of target tumors. Here, we investigated the impact of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 5 (IGFBP5) on irradiation therapy in prostate cancer.  Methods: IGFBP5 gene was overexpressed in human prostate cancer cell lines, PC3 and DU145, with transfection of lentivirus expression vector. Radiosensitivity of the cell lines was assessed with colony formation, cell cycle and cell proliferation assays. The expression of proteins associated with the PI3K-AKT pathway was determined by Western blotting. The effect of IGFBP5 knockdown on PI3K-AKT pathway was tested using PI3K inhibitor.  Results:   Higher expression of IGFBP5 improved the efficacy of radiotherapy for prostate cancer patients. The effects of IGFBP5 were linked to the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Overexpression of IGFBP5 enhanced radiosensitivity and induced G2/M phase arrest in prostate cancer cells. In contrast, it decreased PI3K, p-AKT expression and cell viability. These effects were reversed by IGFBP5 knockdown.  Conclusion:   Our results reveal that IGFBP5 regulates radiosensitivity in prostate cancer via the PI3K-AKT pathway.

A common functional haptoglobin (Hp) polymorphism, originating from a duplication of a gene segment spanning over two exons, results in three distinct phenotypes with different anti-oxidative capacities: Hp1-1, Hp1-2, and Hp2-2. The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between this Hp polymorphism and prostate cancer mortality. The study was performed on 690 patients with histologically confirmed prostate cancer, recruited between January 2004 and January 2007. Hp genotypes were determined by a TaqMan fluorogenic 5'-exonuclease assay. Hp1-1 was present in 76 (11%), Hp1-2 in 314 (45.5%), and Hp2-2 in 300 (43.5%) patients. During a median follow-up of 149 months, 251 (35.3%) patients died. Hp genotypes were not significantly associated with higher overall mortality (HR 1.10; 95% CI 0.91-1.33; p = 0.34). This remained similar in a multivariate analysis including age at diagnosis, androgen deprivation therapy, and risk group based on PSA level, GS, and T stage (HR 1.11; 95% CI 0.91-1.34; p = 0.30).

However, fusion transcripts have not been studied at high spatial resolution in tissue sections due to the lack of full-length transcripts with spatial information. New high-throughput technologies like spatial transcriptomics measure the transcriptome of tissue sections on almost single-cell level. While this technique does not allow for direct detection of fusion transcripts, we show that they can be inferred using the relative poly(A) tail abundance of the involved parental genes.  Method:   We present a new method STfusion, which uses spatial transcriptomics to infer the presence and absence of poly(A) tails. A fusion transcript lacks a poly(A) tail for the 5' gene and has an elevated number of poly(A) tails for the 3' gene. Its expression level is defined by the upstream promoter of the 5' gene. STfusion measures the difference between the observed and expected number of poly(A) tails with a novel C-score.  Results:   We verified the STfusion ability to predict fusion transcripts on HeLa cells with known fusions. STfusion and C-score applied to clinical prostate cancer data revealed the spatial distribution of the cis-SAGe SLC45A3-ELK4 in 12 tissue sections with almost single-cell resolution. The cis-SAGe occurred in disease areas, e.g. inflamed, prostatic intraepithelial neoplastic, or cancerous areas, and occasionally in normal glands.  Conclusions:   STfusion detects fusion transcripts in cancer cell line and clinical tissue data, and distinguishes chimeric transcripts from chimeras caused by trans-splicing events.

Dosimetric and geometric evaluations (AIRC IG-14300)""","""Background and purpose:   The aim was to evaluate dosimetric uncertainties of a mixed beam approach for patients with high-risk prostate cancer (PCa). The treatment consists of a carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) boost followed by whole-pelvis intensity-modulated RT (IMRT).  Materials and methods:   Patients were treated with a CIRT boost of 16.6 Gy/4 fractions followed by whole-pelvis IMRT of 50 Gy/25 fractions, with consequent long term androgen deprivation therapy. Deformable computed tomography image registration (DIR) was performed and corresponding doses were used for plan sum. A comparative IMRT photon plan was obtained as whole-pelvis IMRT of 50 Gy/25 fractions followed by a boost of 28 Gy/14 fractions. DIR performances were evaluated through structure-related and image characteristics parameters.  Results:   Until now, five patients out of ten total enrolled ended the treatment. Dosimetric parameters were lower in CIRT + IMRT than IMRT-only plans for all organs at risk (OARs) except femoral heads. Regarding DIR evaluation, femoral heads were the less deformed OAR. Penile bulb, bladder and anal canal showed intermediate deformation. Rectum was the most deformed. DIR algorithms were patient (P)-dependent, as performances were the highest for P3 and P4, intermediate for P2 and P5, and the lowest for P1.  Conclusions:   CIRT allows better OARs sparing while increasing the efficacy due to the higher radio-biological effect of carbon ions. However, a mixed beam approach could introduce DIR problems in multi-centric treatments with different operative protocols. The development of this prospective trial will lead to more mature data concerning the clinical impact of implementing DIR procedures in dose accumulation applications for high-risk PCa treatments.""","""['Simone Giovanni Gugliandolo', 'Giulia Marvaso', 'Stefania Comi', 'Matteo Pepa', 'Chiara Romanò', 'Dario Zerini', 'Matteo Augugliaro', 'Stefania Russo', 'Barbara Vischioni', 'Francesca Valvo', 'Tommaso Giandini', 'Barbara Avuzzi', 'Riccardo Valdagni', 'Delia Ciardo', 'Ottavio De Cobelli', 'Barbara Alicja Jereczek-Fossa', 'Federica Cattani', 'Roberto Orecchia']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Phys Med""","""['Evaluation of a commercial DIR platform for contour propagation in prostate cancer patients treated with IMRT/VMAT.', 'Phase II multi-institutional clinical trial on a new mixed beam RT scheme of IMRT on pelvis combined with a carbon ion boost for high-risk prostate cancer patients.', 'Dosimetric comparison of high-dose-rate brachytherapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy as a boost to the prostate.', 'Emerging Role of Carbon Ion Radiotherapy in Reirradiation of Recurrent Head and Neck Cancers: What Have We Achieved So Far?', 'Applicability and usage of dose mapping/accumulation in radiotherapy.', 'Mixed-Beam Approach for High-Risk Prostate Cancer Carbon-Ion Boost Followed by Photon Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy: Preliminary Results of Phase II Trial AIRC-IG-14300.', 'Dosimetric Impact of Inter-Fraction Anatomical Changes in Carbon Ion Boost Treatment for High-Risk Prostate Cancer (AIRC IG 14300).']"""

Our aim was to identify novel molecules that functionally contribute to human PCa systemic dissemination based on unbiased approaches.  Methods:   We compared mRNA, microRNA (miR) and protein expression levels in established human PCa xenograft tumours with high (PC-3), moderate (VCaP) or weak (DU-145) spontaneous micrometastatic potential. By focussing on those mRNAs, miRs and proteins that were differentially regulated among the xenograft groups and known to interact with each other we constructed dissemination-related mRNA/miR and protein/miR networks. Next, we clinically and functionally validated our findings.  Results:   Besides known determinants of PCa progression and/or metastasis, our interaction networks include several novel candidates. We observed a clear role of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathways for PCa dissemination, which was additionally confirmed by an independent human PCa model (ARCAP-E/-M). Two converging nodes, CD46 (decreasing with metastatic potential) and DDX21 (increasing with metastatic potential), were used to test the clinical relevance of the networks. Intriguingly, both network nodes consistently added prognostic information for patients with PCa whereas CD46 loss predicted poor outcome independent of established parameters. Accordingly, depletion of CD46 in weakly metastatic PCa cells induced EMT-like properties in vitro and spontaneous micrometastasis formation in vivo.  Conclusions:   The clinical and functional relevance of the dissemination-related interaction networks shown here could be successfully validated by proof-of-principle experiments. Therefore, we suggest a direct pro-metastatic, clinically relevant role for the multiple novel candidates included in this study; these should be further exploited by future studies.""","""['Tobias Lange', 'Timur R Samatov', 'Vladimir V Galatenko', 'Pascal Steffen', 'Helge von Kriegstein', 'Tanja Spethmann', 'Daniel Wicklein', 'Hanna Maar', 'Kristine Kupfernagel', 'Vera Labitzky', 'Sandra Hanika', 'Sarah Starzonek', 'Ann-Kristin Ahlers', 'Kristoffer Riecken', 'Ronald Simon', 'Adam Polonski', 'Guido Sauter', 'Thorsten Schlomm', 'Hartwig Huland', 'Steven A Johnsen', 'Hartmut Schlüter', 'Alexander G Tonevitsky', 'Udo Schumacher']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['Oncogenic miR-210-3p promotes prostate cancer cell EMT and bone metastasis via NF-κB signaling pathway.', 'MicroRNA-539 functions as a tumour suppressor in prostate cancer via the TGF-β/Smad4 signalling pathway by down-regulating DLX1.', 'MicroRNA-132/212 Upregulation Inhibits TGF-β-Mediated Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition of Prostate Cancer Cells by Targeting SOX4.', 'MicroRNAs and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Epithelial protein lost in neoplasm (EPLIN) and prostate cancer: lessons learned from the ARCaP model.', 'Tumor cell integrin β4 and tumor stroma E-/P-selectin cooperatively regulate tumor growth in vivo.', 'Studies of hormonal regulation, phenotype plasticity, bone metastasis, and experimental therapeutics in androgen-repressed human prostate cancer (ARCaP) model.', 'Role of Metastasis-Related microRNAs in Prostate Cancer Progression and Treatment.', 'Opposing prognostic relevance of junction plakoglobin in distinct prostate cancer patient subsets.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the data from cN1 patients who were treated with definitive RT and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) between June 2004 and February 2016. All patients received localized irradiation to the prostate region and whole pelvis irradiation. Some patients received intensity-modulated radiation therapy with RT dose escalation to metastatic LN. Univariate analyses using log-rank test were performed to find prognostic factors between patient subgroups.  Results:   Fifty-one consecutive patients were identified. The median follow-up period for all patients was 88 (range 20-157) months. Primary Gleason pattern and LN RT dose were statistically significant prognostic factors for relapse-free survival (RFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). Especially, RT dose escalation (60 Gy or more) to metastatic LN significantly improved RFS and DMFS compared with standard dose RT (4-year RFS 90.6% vs 82.1%, 7-year RFS 90.6% vs 58.0%, P = .015; 4-year DMFS 90.6% vs 82.1%, 7-year DMFS 90.6% vs 62.8%, P = .023).

Methods:   Observational study from the Cancer Registry of Norway. Patients with high-risk PCa were stratified for three diagnostic periods (2005-08, 2009-12 and 2013-16), age (<70, vs ≥70) and primary treatment (CurTrt: Radical prostatectomy (RP), Radiotherapy (RAD) vs no curative treatment (NoCurTrt)). Competing risk and Kaplan-Meier methods estimated PCSM and overall mortality (OM), respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models estimated odds for CurTrt, and multivariable Fine Gray and Cox regression models evaluated the hazard ratios for PCSM and OM.  Results:   Of 19 763 evaluable patients, 54% were aged ≥70 years. Senior adults had more unfavorable PCa characteristics than younger men. Across diagnostic periods, use of CurTrt increased from 15% to 51% in men aged ≥70 and 65% to 81% in men aged < 70 years. With median five years follow-up, PCSM decreased in all patients (P < .05), in the third period restricted to senior adults. In all patients NoCurTrt was associated with three-fold higher 5-year PCSM and two-fold higher OM compared to CurTrt.  Conclusions:   In high-risk PCa patients, increased use of CurTrt, greatest in senior men, was observed along with decreased PCSM and OM in both senior and younger adults.

Associations between participant cancer type, site-specific FH, and meeting national guidelines for CGC were evaluated via logistic regression. Cancer FH patterns were evaluating via hierarchical clustering.  Results:   Among 1500 ROCS participants, 71% reported at least 1 first-degree relative or grandparent with cancer. FHs of breast cancer, CRC, lung cancer, and prostate cancer were most common among participants with the same diagnosis (odds ratio [OR] for breast cancer, 1.14; P < .001; OR for CRC, 1.08; P = .003; OR for lung cancer, 1.09; P = .008; OR for prostate cancer, 1.14; P < .001). Nearly half of the participants (47%) met national CGC guidelines, and 24.4% of these participants met CGC criteria on the basis of their cancer FH alone. FH was particularly important in determining CGC eligibility for participants with prostate cancer versus breast cancer (OR for FH vs personal history alone, 2.91; 95% confidence interval, 1.94-4.35; P < .001). In clustering analyses, breast and prostate cancer FH-defined clusters were common across all participants. Clustering of CRC and breast cancer FHs was also observed.

Methods:   A series of men at increased risk of PCa undergoing prostate biopsies were enrolled in a single center. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were recorded. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the adult treatment panel III. A nomogram was generated based on the logistic regression model and used to predict high grade prostate cancer defined as grade group ≥3 (ISUP 2014). ROC curves, calibration plots and decision curve analysis were used to evaluate the performance of the nomogram.  Results:   Overall, 738 patients were enrolled. Greater than or equal to 294/738 (40%) of the patients presented PCa and of those patients, 84/294 (39%) presented high grade disease (Grade Group ≥3). On multivariate analysis, DRE (OR: 3.24, 95% CI: 1.80-5.84), PSA (OR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.05-1.16), PV (OR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.97-0.99) and MetS (OR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.13-3.59) were predictors of HG PCa. The nomogram based on the model presented good discrimination (AUC: 0.76), good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow Test, P>0.05) and a net benefit in the range of probabilities between 10% and 70%.  Conclusions:   Metabolic syndrome is highly prevalent in patients at risk of prostate cancer and is particularly associated with high-grade prostate cancer. Our nomogram offers the possibility to include metabolic status in the assessment of patients at risk of prostate cancer to identify men who may have a high-grade form of the disease.

This study aims to test the effects of the number of removed lymph nodes (RLN), positive nodes (pLN), and pLN ratio (pLNR) on cancer-specific survival (CSS) in patients with node-positive prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   A total of 2458 patients with a greater than 5% probability of lymph node invasion according to the updated Briganti nomogram who harboured pathologically confirmed positive nodes in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database between 2004 and 2015 were identified. Multivariable Cox regression with forward stepwise selection was performed to identify independent risk factors for CSS. Maximally selected rank statistics were used to determine the most informative cut-off value for pLN and pLNR.  Results:   The median pLN counts and RLN in the study were two (interquartile range [IQR] 1- 3) and 18 (IQR 15-23), respectively. The RLN counts could not predict CSS, while the higher pLN and pLNR were associated with worse CSS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.11; p < 0.001 and HR, 1.01; p < 0.001, respectively).

The index was constructed using eight indicators: teen births, low birthweight, infant mortality, new HIV diagnoses, people living with HIV, and incidences of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis. Chicago Department of Public Health data (2014-2017) were used to calculate index scores for Chicago community areas; scores were mapped to provide geovisualization and global Moran's I was calculated to assess spatial autocorrelation. Cronbach's alpha was calculated to assess internal reliability of the SRHBI. Pearson correlations were conducted to assess concurrent validity and correlation with community-level factors. Linear regression was conducted to assess community-level predictors of the SRHBI. Application of the SRHBI in Chicago demonstrates substantial variation in SRH burden across Chicago's urban landscape with significant spatial autocorrelation of scores (I = .580, p = .001). Internal reliability of the measure was excellent with α = .937. The SRHBI was significantly correlated with other indicators of SRH including rate of prenatal care initiation in the first trimester, rate of preterm births, reported sexual assault incidence, cervical cancer incidence, prostate cancer incidence, and rate of smoking during pregnancy. This suggests good concurrent validity of the measure. Linear regression revealed that the percent of Black residents, percent of household couples that are same-sex, community violence, economic hardship, and population density were significant predictors of the SRHBI. The SRHBI provides a valid, useful, and replicable measure to assess and communicate community-level SRH burden in urban environments. The SRHBI may be scaled through a multi-city public data dashboard and utilized by urban public health departments to optimally target and tailor SRH interventions to communities.""","""['Kris Rosentel', 'Alicia VandeVusse', 'Tina Schuh']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Urban Health""","""['Sexual and reproductive health services utilization and associated factors among adolescents attending secondary schools.', ""Women's costs for accessing comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services: findings from an observational study in Johannesburg, South Africa."", 'Factors associated with sexual and reproductive health stigma among adolescent girls in Ghana.', 'Sexual and reproductive health needs of young people living with HIV in low- and middle-income countries: a scoping review.', 'An overview of the sexual and reproductive health status and service delivery among Syrian refugees in Jordan, nine years since the crisis: a systematic literature review.', 'Geospatial Social Determinants of Health Correlate with Disparities in Syphilis and Congenital Syphilis Cases in California.']"""

Despite this, there are limitations to the diagnostic accuracy of PSA. Consideration of patient demographic factors and biochemical adjuncts to PSA may improve prostate cancer risk stratification. We aimed to develop a contemporary, accurate and cost-effective model based on objective measures to improve the accuracy of prostate cancer risk stratification.  Methods:   Data were collated from a local institution and combined with patient data retrieved from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer screening Trial (PLCO) database. Using a dataset of 4548 patients, a machine learning model was developed and trained using PSA, free-PSA, age and free-PSA to total PSA (FTR) ratio.  Results:   The model was trained on a dataset involving 3638 patients and was then tested on a separate set of 910 patients. The model improved prediction for prostate cancer (AUC 0.72) compared to PSA alone (AUC 0.63), age (AUC 0.52), free-PSA (AUC 0.50) and FTR alone (AUC 0.65). When an operating point is chosen such that the sensitivity of the model is 80% the specificity of the model is 45.3%. The benefit in AUC secondary to the model was related to sample size, with AUC of 0.64 observed when a subset of the cohort was assessed.

Objective:   To provide an evidence-based description and video-based illustration of currently available dissection techniques for robotic prostatectomy.  Design, setting, and participants:   A literature search was performed to retrieve articles describing different surgical approaches and techniques for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) and to analyze data supporting their use. Video material was provided by experts in the field to illustrate these approaches and techniques.  Surgical procedure:   Multiple surgical approaches are available: extraperitoneal, transvesical, transperitoneal posterior, transperitoneal anterior, Retzius sparing, and transperineal. Surgical techniques for prostatic dissection sensu strictu are the following: omission of the endopelvic fascia dissection, bladder neck preservation, incremental nerve sparing by means of an antegrade or retrograde approach, and preservation of the puboprostatic ligaments and dorsal venous complex. Recently, techniques for total or partial prostatectomy have been described.  Measurements:   Different surgical approaches and techniques for robotic prostatectomy have been analyzed.  Results and limitations:   Two randomized controlled trials evaluating the extraperitoneal versus the transperitoneal approach have demonstrated similar results. Level I evidence on the Retzius-sparing approach demonstrated earlier return to continence than the traditional anterior approach. The question whether Retzius-sparing RARP is associated with a higher rate of positive surgical margins is still open due to the intrinsic bias in terms of surgical expertise in the available comparative studies. This technique also offers an advantage in patients who have received kidney transplantation. Retrospective evidence suggests that the more the anatomical dissection (eg., more periprostatic tissue is preserved), the better the functional outcome in terms of continence. Yet, two randomized controlled trials evaluating the different techniques of dissection have so far been produced. Partial prostatectomies should not be offered outside clinical trials.  Conclusions:   Several techniques and approaches are available for prostate dissection during RARP. While the Retzius-sparing approach seems to provide earlier return to continence than the traditional anterior transperitoneal approach, no technique has been proved to be superior to other(s) in terms of long-term outcomes in randomized studies.

Bone is the most frequent site of PCa metastases, and up to 90% of patients with advanced PCa develop bone metastases. An altered bone marrow microenvironment, induced by obesity, is a significant mediator for the bone tropism of PCa. However, the specific molecular mechanisms by which obesity causes changes in the bone marrow microenvironment, leading to PCa bone metastasis, are not fully understood. Our results demonstrate that a high-fat diet (HFD) leads to dyslipidemia and changes in bone marrow of nude mice: an increase in the area and number of adipocytes and a reduction in the area and number of osteoblasts. Moreover, a HFD promoted cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) expression and inhibited osteoprotegerin (OPG) expression in the bone microenvironment. Additionally, the total level of free fatty acids (FFAs) and caprylic acid (C8:0) was significantly higher in PCa patients with bone metastases.

Materials and methods:   In this work, 191 radiomic features were extracted from mp-MRI from prostate cancer patients. A comprehensive set of support vector machine (SVM) models for T2WI and mp-MRI (T2WI + DWI, T2WI + DTI, and T2WI + DWI + DTI) were developed based on novel Bayesian parameters optimization method and validated using leave-one-patient-out approach to eliminate any possible overfitting. The diagnostic performance of each model was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The average sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the models were evaluated using the test data set and the corresponding binary maps generated. Finally, the SVM plus sigmoid function of the models with the highest performance were used to produce cancer probability maps.  Results:   The T2WI + DWI + DTI models using the optimal feature subset achieved the best performance in prostate cancer detection, with the average AUROC , sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.93 ± 0.03, 0.85 ± 0.05, 0.82 ± 0.07, and 0.83 ± 0.04, respectively. The average diagnostic performance of T2WI + DTI models was slightly higher than T2WI + DWI models (+3.52%) using the optimal radiomic features.  Conclusions:   Combination of noncontrast mp-MRI (T2WI, DWI, and DTI) features with the framework of a supervised classification technique and Bayesian optimization method are able to differentiate cancer from noncancer voxels with high accuracy and without administration of contrast agent. The addition of cancer probability maps provides additional functionality for image interpretation, lesion heterogeneity evaluation, and treatment management.""","""['Neda Gholizadeh', 'John Simpson', 'Saadallah Ramadan', 'Jim Denham', 'Peter Lau', 'Sabbir Siddique', 'Jason Dowling', 'James Welsh', 'Stephan Chalup', 'Peter B Greer']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Diagnosis of transition zone prostate cancer by multiparametric MRI: added value of MR spectroscopic imaging with sLASER volume selection.', 'Peripheral zone prostate cancer localization by multiparametric magnetic resonance at 3 T: unbiased cancer identification by matching to histopathology.', 'Combining multiparametric MRI features-based transfer learning and clinical parameters: application of machine learning for the differentiation of uterine sarcomas from atypical leiomyomas.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'The clinical value of diffusion-weighted imaging in combination with T2-weighted imaging in diagnosing prostate carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Multi-resolution super learner for voxel-wise classification of prostate cancer using multi-parametric MRI.', 'Detection of prostate cancer using diffusion-relaxation correlation spectrum imaging with support vector machine model - a feasibility study.', 'Structured Reporting in Radiological Settings: Pitfalls and Perspectives.', 'Radiomics in prostate cancer imaging for a personalized treatment approach - current aspects of methodology and a systematic review on validated studies.', 'Artificial Intelligence Based Algorithms for Prostate Cancer Classification and Detection on Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Narrative Review.']"""

Repeat protocol biopsy is essential for evaluating cancer aggressiveness. However, the acceptance rate of repeat biopsy is not high enough because of the burdens of biopsy. We assessed the impact of complications after the initial biopsy on repeat protocol biopsy at 1 year using data from the Prostate Cancer Research International: Active Surveillance (PRIAS)-JAPAN study.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis using a prospective cohort in the PRIAS-JAPAN study. Patients with favorable-risk prostate cancer (n = 856) who consented to participate in the PRIAS-JAPAN study from 2010 to 2018 were enrolled. Follow-up evaluations included regular prostate-specific antigen, digital rectal examination and biopsy. Rates of complications after biopsies and repeat protocol biopsy non-acceptance rate at 1 year were reported. Logistic regression analysis explored the association between the complications after the initial biopsy and repeat protocol biopsy non-acceptance.  Results:   Altogether, 759 patients (88.7%) actually proceeded to protocol at 1 year. Repeat protocol biopsy non-acceptance rate at 1 year was 14.9%. Regarding complications after the initial biopsy, hematuria (p = 0.028) and pain (p < 0.001) rates were significantly higher in the repeat biopsy non-acceptance group, but infection (p = 0.056) and hematospermia (p = 0.337) rates were not different. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, pain was a significant predictor for repeat protocol biopsy non-acceptance (odds ratio 4.68, 95% confidence interval 1.864-11.75; p = 0.001).

Moreover, in silico analysis indicated the Methionine synthase expression is down-regulated in both young and old PCa subjects (P < 0.05). Compared with the normal subjects, the down-regulated expression of Methionine synthase was found in PCa cases with Gleason score 6 to 9. Our study showed that Methionine synthase rs1805087 A/G variant may be associated with susceptibility of PCa, especially in Asian populations, hospital-based studies and that with high quality and large sample size.

Patients with bone metastases are at risk of devastating skeletal related events, including pathological fractures.  Purpose:   The aim of this study was to analyze the efficacy of zoledronic acid (ZA) versus denosumab in the prevention of pathological fractures in patients with bone metastases from advanced cancers by evaluating all available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on this subject.  Methods:   A systematic search of electronic databases (PubMed and MEDLINE) was performed to identify all published RCTs comparing ZA with denosumab in prevention of pathological fractures in bone metastases. Risk of bias of the studies was assessed. The primary outcomes evaluated were pathological fractures.  Results:   Four RCTs (7,320 patients) were included. Denosumab was superior to ZA in reducing the likelihood of pathological fractures, when all tumor types were combined (odds ratio [OR] 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 0.99, P = 0.04). Denosumab was favored, although not statistically significant, over ZA in endodermal origin (breast and prostate) (OR 0.85, 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.05, P = 0.13) and mesodermal origin tumors (solid tumors and multiple myeloma) (OR 0.87, 95% CI, 0.71 to 1.06, P = 0.16).  Discussion:   Denosumab moderately reduces the likelihood of pathological fractures in comparison to ZA in patients with bone metastases with statistical significance. When pathological fractures were grouped by tumor origin (endodermal or mesodermal), no statistical difference was observed between denosumab and ZA.

Clinically, the distinction between these 2 tumors can also be difficult. Proper diagnosis in these patients is essential as they have differing prognoses and clinical management. GATA3 is thought to be a sensitive and relatively specific marker of urothelial carcinoma. However, there is scant data regarding GATA3 labeling of high-grade prostatic adenocarcinoma. The aim of this study is to describe rare cases with strong aberrant GATA3 staining in prostatic adenocarcinoma as a potential diagnostic pitfall. We identified 9 cases of prostatic adenocarcinoma with aberrant positive GATA3 staining from 2015 to 2020 as part of a large consultation service at our institution. All 9 cases were grade group 5, 8 had a Gleason score of 5+5=10 and 1 had a score of 4+5=9. Five of the cases were from the prostate, 3 from the urinary bladder, and 1 from the prostatic urethra. All cases were morphologically typical of high-grade prostatic adenocarcinoma, although were sent for consultation due to uncertainty in the diagnosis. GATA3 positivity was strong, diffuse in 4 cases; strong, patchy in 2 cases and strong, focal in 3 cases. All cases were positive for NKX3.1, 6 positive for p501s, and 6 positive for PSA, with 7/9 cases showing expression of at least 2 prostate-specific markers. The current study describes that rare cases of prostatic adenocarcinoma can show focal or diffuse strong staining for GATA3. In order to avoid this diagnostic pitfall, undifferentiated carcinomas involving the prostate, bladder neck, or trigone should be evaluated not only with GATA3 but also prostate-specific markers.""","""['Timothy M McDonald', 'Jonathan I Epstein']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['Pseudopapillary features in prostatic adenocarcinoma mimicking urothelial carcinoma: a diagnostic pitfall.', 'GATA3 Positivity in Benign Radiated Prostate Glands: A Potential Diagnostic Pitfall.', 'Immunohistochemical differentiation of high-grade prostate carcinoma from urothelial carcinoma.', 'Best practices recommendations in the application of immunohistochemistry in the prostate: report from the International Society of Urologic Pathology consensus conference.', 'Metastatic lymph node collision of a prostatic adenocarcinoma and an urothelial carcinoma and review of the literature.', 'Poorly Differentiated Scrotal Carcinoma With Apocrine Immunophenotype.', 'Mining The Cancer Genome Atlas gene expression data for lineage markers in distinguishing bladder urothelial carcinoma and prostate adenocarcinoma.']"""

A retrospective study was conducted on elderly patients who had prostate biopsy at Kanazawa University Hospital (Kanazawa, Japan) between 2000 and 2017. Of the 2251 patients who underwent prostate biopsy, 254 had clinically significant prostate cancer (CSPC) with a Gleason score (GS) of≥7 and 273 had a GS of <7 or no malignancy. In this study, patients aged 75 years or older were classified as elderly patients. GS ≥ 7 was characterized by a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of the maximum area under the curve of 12 ng ml-1 with a sensitivity of 76.2% and a specificity of 73.2%. For PSA levels between 4 ng ml-1 and 12 ng ml-1, based on the maximum area under the curve, patients with three or four of the following factors may present a GS of ≥ 7: percent free PSA >24, PSA density≥ 0.24 ng ml-2, positive findings on digital rectal examination, and transrectal with 90.0% sensitivity and 67.4% specificity. In this study, we found that raising the PSA cutoff to 12 ng ml-1 for CSPC in elderly individuals can significantly reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies.

Most patients initially respond to androgen deprivation but finally develop hormone-refractory disease, which results in advanced clinical failure and death. Since hormone-refractory disease is highly radiotherapy and chemotherapy resistant, increasing interest has been placed on finding novel therapies for this advanced type of Pca.  Purpose:   The potential cytotoxic effects of the crude extract and fractions obtained from the leaves of Cecropia pachystachya Trécul on different human cancer cell lines were investigated. Additionally, the mechanism of cell death induction of the most active sample (triterpene-enriched fraction, TEF) on the human hormone-refractory prostate PC3 cell line was examined.  Methods:   Sulforhodamine B assay was used to measure the viability of human tumor and non-tumor cell lines. To elucidate the mechanism of PC3 cells death induced by TEF, different methodological approaches were used: cell cycle analysis and annexin V/PI staining, nuclear morphological analysis, and senescence-associated-β-galactosidase assay. Moreover, the mitochondrial membrane potential was measured, and the long-term effects of TEF on PC3 cells were evaluated.  Results:   TEF exerted cytotoxic effects on PC3 cells but not on human non-tumor cells. The analysis of nuclear morphology of PC3 cells treated with TEF increased the number of cells with large and regular nuclei suggesting senescence induction, which was supported by β-galactosidase overexpression. Regarding PC3 cells cycle, TEF reduced the number of cells in G1 phase and increased that in sub G0/G1. Apoptosis was not involved in PC3 cell death. However, there was a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential without the participation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cytotoxic effects detected. Furthermore, there was a decrease in the number of viable cells able to duplicate after long-term TEF treatment.

Its cytotoxicity has been previously reported against breast cancer cell lines. The low water solubility of this natural product, that hampers its bioavailability, motivated the investigation of a new nanoparticle formulation containing the triterpene in order to improve its bioactivity. The triterpene was encapsulated in polycaprolactone (PCL) polymer by nanoprecipitation, producing homogenic nanoparticles with nanometer sizes (122.7 ± 2.06 nm), which were characterized by FT-IR, SEM imaging and DSC. The cytotoxicity (MTT method) of the nanoparticle containing the triterpene 1, besides the free natural product and the nanoparticle control (without 1), was assayed against three human tumor cell lines [human colon carcinoma line (HCT116), prostate (PC3) and glioblastoma (SNB19)] and the normal epithelial embryo kidney human cell line (Hek293T).

The metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) was initially identified as a lncRNA with elevated expression in primary human non-small cell lung tumors with high propensity to metastasize, and subsequently shown to be highly expressed in numerous other human cancers including breast, ovarian, prostate, cervical, endometrial, gastric, pancreatic, sarcoma, colorectal, bladder, brain, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma. MALAT1 is deeply involved in several physiological processes, including alternative splicing, epigenetic modification of gene expression, cellular senescence, healthy aging, and redox homeostasis. The aim of this work was to investigate the modulation exerted by a single bout of endurance exercise on the level of MALAT1 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy male donors displaying different training status and redox homeostasis features. Our findings show that MALAT1 is downregulated after acute endurance exercise in subjects whose fitness level guarantee a high expression of SOD1 and SOD2 antioxidant genes and low levels of endogenous oxidative damage. In vitro protocols in Jurkat lymphoblastoid cells exposed to pro-oxidant environment confirmed the link between MALAT1 expression and antioxidant gene modulation, documenting p53 phosphorylation and its recruitment to MALAT1 promoter. Remarkably, analyses of Microarray-Based Gene Expression Profiling revealed high MALAT1 expression in leukemia patients in comparison to healthy control and a significant negative correlation between MALAT1 and SOD1 expression.

Various studies have identified CA to have anti-proliferative action on glioblastoma, melanoma, prostate and lung carcinoma cells.  Objective:   Our objective was to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the cytotoxic effect of CA in killing MDA-MB-231 triple negative breast cancer cells.  Methods:   We performed MTT assay and trypan blue assay to determine cell viability and cell death, respectively. Comet analysis was carried out to investigate DNA damage of individual cells. Furthermore, AO/EtBr assay and sub-G1 analysis using flow cytometry were used to study apoptosis. Protein isolation followed by immunoblotting was used to observe protein abundance in treated and untreated cancer cells.  Results:   Using MTT assay, we have determined CA to reduce cell viability in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and tumorigenic HEK 293 cells but not in normal NIH3T3 fibroblast cells. Subsequently, trypan blue assay and comet assay showed CA to cause cell death and DNA damage, respectively, in the MDA-MB-231 cells. Using AO/EtBr staining and sub-G1 analysis, we further established CA to increase apoptosis. Additionally, immunoblotting showed the abundance of TNFA, TNF Receptor 1 (TNFR1) and cleaved caspase-8/-3 proapoptotic proteins to increase with CA treatment. Subsequently, blocking of TNFA-TNFR1 signalling by small molecule inhibitor, R-7050, reduced the expression of cleaved caspase-8 and caspase-3 at the protein level.

The existence of a correlation between lipid metabolism disorders and cancer of the prostate gland has been widely known for a long time. According to hypotheses, cholesterol may contribute to prostate cancer progression as a result of its participation as a signaling molecule in prostate growth and differentiation via numerous biologic mechanisms including Akt signaling and de novo steroidogenesis. The results of some studies suggest that increased cholesterol levels may be associated with a higher risk of a more aggressive course of the disease. The aforementioned alterations in the synthesis of fatty acids are a unique feature of cancer and, therefore, constitute an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of prostate cancer. Pharmacological or gene therapy aims to reduce the activity of enzymes involved in de novo synthesis of fatty acids, FASN, ACLY (ATP citrate lyase) or SCD-1 (Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase) in particular, that may result in cells growth arrest. Nevertheless, not all cancers are unequivocally associated with hypocholesterolaemia. It cannot be ruled out that the relationship between prostate cancer and lipid disorders is not a direct quantitative correlation between carcinogenesis and the amount of circulating cholesterol. Perhaps the correspondence is more sophisticated and connected to the distribution of cholesterol fractions or even sub-fractions of e.g. HDL cholesterol.""","""['Justyna Dłubek', 'Jacek Rysz', 'Zbigniew Jabłonowski', 'Anna Gluba-Brzózka', 'Beata Franczyk']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Curr Med Chem""","""['miR-22 inhibits tumor growth and metastasis by targeting ATP citrate lyase: evidence in osteosarcoma, prostate cancer, cervical cancer and lung cancer.', 'Key Molecules of Fatty Acid Metabolism in Gastric Cancer.', 'Targeting ACLY sensitizes castration-resistant prostate cancer cells to AR antagonism by impinging on an ACLY-AMPK-AR feedback mechanism.', 'The role of ATP citrate-lyase in the metabolic regulation of plasma lipids.

We hypothesized that visceral obesity is more strongly associated with poor prostate cancer outcomes than overall obesity defined by BMI.  Materials and methods:   We quantified abdominal visceral and subcutaneous fat area (VFA and SFA), and pelvic periprostatic adipose tissue area (PPAT), using computed tomography scans from radiation-treated prostate cancer patients at the Durham North Carolina Veterans Administration Hospital. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression examined associations between each adiposity measure and risk of recurrence, overall and stratified by race and receipt of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).  Results:   Of 401 patients (59% black) treated from 2005 to 2011, 84 (21%) experienced recurrence during 9.3 years median follow-up. Overall, obesity defined by BMI was not associated with recurrence risk overall or stratified by race or ADT, nor was any measure of fat distribution related to the risk of recurrence overall or by race. However, higher VFA was associated with increased risk of recurrence in men who received radiation only (hazard ratio [HR], 1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.87-3.66), but inversely associated with recurrence risk in men treated with radiation and ADT (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.24-1.03; P-interaction = .002), though neither association reached statistical significance. Similar patterns of ADT-stratified associations were observed for PPAT and SFA.  Conclusions:   Associations between abdominal and pelvic adiposity measures and recurrence risk differed significantly by ADT receipt, with positive directions of association observed only in men not receiving ADT.

A previous study performed yeast two-hybrid screening and identified the small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein α (SGTA), known as a negative modulator of cytoplasmic androgen receptor (AR) signaling, which is a novel interacting partner of REIC/Dkk-3. The previous study also indicated that the REIC/Dkk-3 protein interferes with the dimerization of SGTA and then upregulates the AR transport and signaling in human prostate cancer PC3 cells. Since the transport of some steroid receptors to nucleus is conducted similarly by dynein motor-dependent way, the current study aimed to investigate the role of SGTA and REIC/Dkk-3 in the transport of other glucocorticoid receptors (GR). In vitro reporter assays for the cytoplasmic GR transport were performed in human prostate cancer PC3 cells and 293T cells. As for the SGTA protein, a suppressive effect on the GR transport to the nucleus was observed in the cells. As for the REIC/Dkk-3 protein, an inhibitory effect was observed for the GR transport in PC3 cells. Under the depleted condition of SGTA by short-hairpin (sh)RNA, the downregulation of GR transport by REIC/Dkk-3 was significantly enhanced compared with the non-depleted condition in PC3 cells, suggesting a compensatory role of REIC/Dkk-3 in the SGTA mediated inhibition of GR transport. The current study therefore demonstrated that SGTA inhibited the cytoplasmic transport of GR in 293T and PC3 cells, and REIC/Dkk-3 also inhibited the cytoplasmic transport of GR in PC3 cells.

Long non-protein-coding RNAs may possess significant cellular functions. Plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1), a long non-coding RNA encoded by the human PVT1 gene, is an oncogene, which can regulate several tumor-related genes. In PCa, the function and mechanism of PVT1 are unclear. NOP2 is being pursued as a prognostic marker for cancer aggressiveness, which promotes mouse fibroblast growth and tumor formation. Essentially, nothing is known about the specific interactions between the PVT1 and NOP2.  Methods:   190 pairs of PCa tissues and adjacent normal tissues were collected and RNA sequencing was used to identify the differential lncRNAs. Real-time quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) confirmed these results and gene regulatory relationship. Lentiviral vectors were used to alter PVT1 and genes to analyze their effects on PCa progression. Transwell migration and invasion assays were performed to test the metastasis ability. Biofunction of PVT1 and NOP2 were confirmed in vitro and in vivo.  Results:   In this study, we reported that the long noncoding RNA-PVT1 was upregulated in PCa metastasis tissues and promoted migration of PCa cells in vitro and their metastasis in vivo. High levels of PVT1 significantly downregulated tumor suppressor microRNAs (miRNAs), such as miR-15b-5p, miR-27a-3p, miR-143-3p, and miR-627-5p, whose levels in metastasis tissues were low compared to those in non-metastasis tissues. In vitro and in vivo, PVT1 promotes PCa metastasis via targeting miRNAs. Furthermore, the expression level of PVT1 was positively associated with the expression of NOP2, a cancer metastasis-related protein. We demonstrated that NOP2 promoted invasion and migration of PCa. For specific mechanism, correlation analysis showed that PVT1 promoted metastasis by up-regulating NOP2.  Conclusion:   Taken together, our results show that PVT1 acts as an inducer of PCa metastasis via targeting miRNAs, thereby promoting NOP2.

In this study, we used proteomics approaches to investigate the secreted proteins (secretome) of paired human androgen-repressed prostate cancer (ARCaP) cell lines, representing the epithelial (ARCaP-E) and mesenchymal (ARCaP-M) phenotypes. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses showed high levels of proteins involved in bone remodeling and extracellular matrix degradation in the ARCaP-M cells, consistent with the bone metastasis phenotype. Furthermore, LC-MS/MS showed a significantly higher level of the serine protease granzyme B (GZMB) in ARCaP-M conditioned media (CM) compared to that of ARCaP-E. Using quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to detect mRNA and Western blot to detect protein expression, we further demonstrated that the GZMB gene was expressed by ARCaP-M and the protein was secreted extracellularly. ARCaP-M cells with GZMB gene knockdown using small interfering RNA (siRNA) have markedly reduced invasiveness as demonstrated by the Matrigel invasion assay in comparison with the scrambled siRNA negative control.

Here, anticancer activity and mechanism of action was investigated for the first time using a human prostate cancer (PCa) model. MomC was active in all PCa cell lines at low micromolar concentrations and induced an unusual caspase-independent, non-apoptotic cell death. Kinase activity screening identified activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK1/2) to be one of the primary molecular mechanism of MomC anticancer activity. Functional assays demonstrated a specific and selective JNK1/2 activation prior to the induction of other cell death related processes. Inhibition of JNK1/2 by pretreatment with the JNK-inhibitor SP600125 antagonized cytotoxic activity of the marine compound. MomC caused an upregulation of cytotoxic ROS. However, in contrast to other ROS-inducing agents, co-treatment with PARP-inhibitor olaparib revealed antagonistic effects indicating an active PARP to be necessary for MomC activity. Interestingly, although no direct regulation of p38 and ERK1/2 were detected, active p38 kinase was required for MomC efficacy, while the inhibition of ERK1/2 increased its cytotoxicity.

Molecular markers to help guide responses are scarce and currently not used in the clinical setting.  Methods:   To identify novel biomarkers and pathways involved in response to BCG immunotherapy, we performed a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of NMIBCs before BCG therapy. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of DNA isolated from tumors of 26 BCG responders and 27 failures were obtained using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip.  Results:   Distinct DNA methylation patterns were found by genome-wide analysis in the two groups. Differentially methylated CpG sites were predominantly located in gene promoters and gene bodies associated with bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, chemokine signaling, endocytosis, and focal adhesion. In total, 40 genomic regions with a significant difference in methylation between responders and failures were detected. The differential methylation state of six of these regions, localized in the promoters of the genes GPR158, KLF8, C12orf42, WDR44, FLT1, and CHST11, were internally validated by bisulfite-sequencing. GPR158 promoter hypermethylation was the best predictor of BCG failure with an AUC of 0.809 (p-value < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Tumors from BCG responders and BCG failures harbor distinct DNA methylation profiles.

A combination of uPAR PET and multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) was performed, and the SUV in the primary tumor, as delineated by mpMRI, was measured by 2 independent readers. The correlation between the SUV and the Gleason score obtained by biopsy was assessed. Results: A total of 27 patients had histologically verified PCa visible on mpMRI and constituted the study population. There was a positive correlation between the SUVmax and the Gleason score (Spearman ρ = 0.55; P = 0.003). Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed an area under the curve of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.67-1.00) for discriminating a Gleason score of greater than or equal to 3 + 4 from a Gleason score of less than or equal to 3 + 3.

Method:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (2004-2015), we performed analyses of cancer-specific mortality (CSM) and overall mortality (OM) in the comparisons of local treatment (LT) versus no local treatment (NLT) and radical prostatectomy (RP) versus radiation therapy (RT).

Freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF), freedom from metastases (FFMs), cause-specific survival (CSS), and morbidity were compared for the two isotopes by the ANOVA and the χ2 test with survival determined by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression.  Results:   Men treated with I-125 had a higher stage (p < 0.001), biological equivalent dose (BED) (p < 0.001), and longer hormone therapy (neoadjuvant hormone therapy, p < 0.001), where men treated with Pd-103 had a higher Gleason score (GS, p < 0.001) and longer followup (median 8.3 vs. 5.3 years, p < 0.001). Ten-year FFBF, FFM, and CSS for I-125 vs. Pd-103 were 77.5 vs. 80.2% (p = 0.897), 94.7 vs. 91.9% (p = 0.017), and 95.4 vs. 91.8% (p = 0.346), respectively. Men with T3 had superior CSS (94.1 vs. 79.5%, p = 0.001) with I-125. Significant covariates by Cox regression for FFBF were prostate specific antigen (PSA), the GS, and the BED (p < 0.001), for FFM PSA (p < 0.001) and GS (p = 0.029), and for CSS PSA, the GS (p < 0.001) and the BED (p = 0.022). Prostate cancer mortality was 7/62 (15.6%) for BED ≤ 150 Gy, 18/229 (7.9%) for BED >150-200 Gy, and 20/470 (5.9%) for BED >200 Gy (p = 0.029). Long-term morbidity was not different for the two isotopes.  Conclusions:   Brachytherapy boost with I-125 and Pd-103 appears equally effective yielding 10-year CSS of over 90%. I-125 may have an advantage in T3 disease. Higher doses yield the most favorable survival.""","""['Nelson N Stone', 'Vassilios M Skouteris', 'Barry S Rosenstein', 'Richard G Stock']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Long-term biochemical control and cause-specific survival in men with Gleason grade Group 4 and 5 prostate cancer treated with brachytherapy and external beam irradiation.', 'PSA nadir of <0.5 ng/mL following brachytherapy for early-stage prostate adenocarcinoma is associated with freedom from prostate-specific antigen failure.', 'Radiation dose predicts for biochemical control in intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients treated with low-dose-rate brachytherapy.', 'Preliminary toxicity and prostate-specific antigen response of a Phase I/II trial of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, 103Pd brachytherapy, and three-dimensional conformal external beam irradiation in the treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Ten-year disease free survival after transperineal sonography-guided iodine-125 brachytherapy with or without 45-gray external beam irradiation in the treatment of patients with clinically localized, low to high Gleason grade prostate carcinoma.']"""

Chemotherapy is an important method to deal with the positive margin. However, systemic chemotherapy is required for long-term administration and has great side effects on health, which cause great pain to the patients. Local administration of slow-release materials provides an opportunity to improve the situation. In this study, we utilized electrospinning technology to create the drug sustained-release materials with nanofibrous structure, which were made from polylactic acid and a certain proportion of chemotherapy drugs (gemcitabine and cisplatin). In vitro release behavior of the drug sustained-release materials were explored by the high-performance liquid chromatography. The antitumor efficacy of the drug sustained-release materials was preliminarily verified in prostate cancer and breast cancer in vitro. Through animal models of breast cancer, the drug sustained-release materials in the treatment of the positive margin has been well documented in vivo, and we also found that the drug sustained-release materials could definitely reduce the liver damage and myelosuppression compared with systemic chemotherapy. In summary, the experimental results showed that the local administration of the drug sustained-release materials could effectively inhibit the growth of the positive incision margins and definitely reduce the partial side effects associated with systemic chemotherapy.""","""['Yunpeng Zhu', 'Shiliang Liu', 'Chunxiang Feng', 'Chang Liu', 'Zhixian Wang', 'Kai Yu', 'Jing Wang', 'Xiaoyong Zeng']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Tissue Eng Part A""","""['A Multilayer Nanofibrous Mat for the Topical Chemotherapy of the Positive Margin in Bladder Cancer.', 'Injectable hydrogels for the sustained delivery of a HER2-targeted antibody for preventing local relapse of HER2+ breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery.', 'Targeted concurrent and sequential delivery of chemotherapeutic and antiangiogenic agents to the brain by using drug-loaded nanofibrous membranes.', 'Facile electrospinning of an efficient drug delivery system.', 'Local failure and margin status in early-stage breast carcinoma treated with conservation surgery and radiation therapy.', 'A Multilayer Nanofibrous Mat for the Topical Chemotherapy of the Positive Margin in Bladder Cancer.', 'Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of PLGA-based doxorubicin-loaded implants for tumor therapy.']"""

Patients and methods:   Using nationwide population-based data in the Bladder Cancer Data Base Sweden (BladderBaSe), we analysed the probability of treatment with curative intent, and UBC-specific and overall survival (OS) in patients with UBC diagnosed in the period 1997-2014 with or without OPC. The analyses considered the patient's characteristics, UBC tumour stage at diagnosis, and site of OPC.  Results:   There were 38 689 patients, of which 9804 (25%) had OPCs. Those with synchronous OPCs more often had T2 and T3 tumours and clinically distant disease at diagnosis than those with UBC only. Patients with synchronous prostate cancer, female genital cancer and lower gastro-intestinal cancer were more often treated with curative intent than patients with UBC only. When models of survival were adjusted for age at diagnosis, marital status, education, year of diagnosis, Charlson Comorbidity Index and T-stage, UBC-specific survival was similar to patients with UBC only, but OS was lower for patients with synchronous OPC, explained mainly by deaths in OPC primaries with a bad prognosis.  Conclusions:   OPC is common in patients with UBC. Treatment for UBC, after or in conjunction with an OPC, should not be neglected and carries just as high a probability of success as treatment in patients with UBC only.

Liver and other visceral metastases are associated with worse overall survival. Recent evidence suggests the frequency of visceral metastases may be increasing for reasons that are unclear but may be related to selective pressures induced by modern therapies, including second-generation antiandrogen receptor signaling inhibitors such as enzalutamide and abiraterone. Consequently, robust models to study the pathobiology of prostate cancer liver metastases and their response to therapy are urgently needed.  Methods:   Hemi-spleen injection of human (LN95, PC3, VCaP, and MDA-PCa-2b) or syngeneic (Myc-CaP) prostate cancer cells (1 × 106 ) was performed to seed liver metastases via the splenic vessels. Plasma levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were monitored longitudinally in human androgen receptor-positive (AR+) models. Immunohistochemical staining of AR and HoxB13 was performed to document the prostatic origin of hepatic lesions.  Results:   LN95, PC3, and Myc-CaP produced distinct liver micrometastases that progressed to macrometastases by ~2 to 4 weeks postinoculation, while inoculation of MDA-PCa-2b and VCaP only produced occasional micrometastases and seeding of individual cells adjacent to blood vessels, respectively, at the time points analyzed. All lesions are characterized by positive staining for nuclear AR and/or the prostate-specific differentiation marker HoxB13 depending on the model. Circulating PSA levels are strongly correlated with overall tumor burden in mice seeded with LN95. Histologic micrometastases and low levels of circulating PSA are detected in mice seeded with MDA-PCa-2b at ~60 days postinoculation, but no circulating PSA was detected in animals inoculated with VCaP up to ~75 days despite the presence of rare AR+ cells in the liver.  Conclusion:   The studies reported herein establish intrasplenic injection as a robust model of mCRPC liver metastasis. In addition, circulating PSA was validated as a noninvasive biomarker to longitudinally monitor overall tumor burden when using PSA+ models. Therefore, this model can be used to interrogate the pathophysiology of prostate cancer liver metastases, the microenvironmental factors permissive to such growth, immunologic variables, and the response of hepatic lesions to therapy.""","""['Brian W Simons', 'Susan Dalrymple', 'Marc Rosen', 'Lei Zheng', 'W Nathaniel Brennen']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Plasma Androgen Receptor and Docetaxel for Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'AR-V7 in Peripheral Whole Blood of Patients with Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Association with Treatment-specific Outcome Under Abiraterone and Enzalutamide.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

However, the ability to effectively evaluate the drug's efficacy remains a challenge. Impediments to broad applicability include inaccuracies in many of the computational drug-target algorithms and a lack of clinically relevant biologic modeling systems to validate the computational data for subsequent translation.  Methods:   We have integrated our computational proteochemometric systems network pharmacology platform, DrugGenEx-Net, with primary, continuous cultures of conditionally reprogrammed (CR) normal and prostate cancer (PCa) cells derived from treatment-naive patients with primary PCa.  Results:   Using the transcriptomic data from two matched pairs of benign and tumor-derived CR cells, we constructed drug networks to describe the biological perturbation associated with each prostate cell subtype at multiple levels of biological action. We prioritized the drugs by analyzing these networks for statistical coincidence with the drug action networks originating from known and predicted drug-protein targets. Prioritized drugs shared between the two patients' PCa cells included carfilzomib (CFZ), bortezomib (BTZ), sulforaphane, and phenethyl isothiocyanate. The effects of these compounds were then tested in the CR cells, in vitro. We observed that the IC50 values of the normal PCa CR cells for CFZ and BTZ were higher than their matched tumor CR cells. Transcriptomic analysis of CFZ-treated CR cells revealed that genes involved in cell proliferation, proteases, and downstream targets of serine proteases were inhibited while KLK7 and KLK8 were induced in the tumor-derived CR cells.

All patients had their PHI measured before prostate biopsy. In patients with an mpMRI suspicious lesions, an mpMRI/ultrasound software fusion-guided biopsy was performed first, with 12 core systematic biopsy performed in all patients. A ROC analysis was performed for PCa detection for total PSA, PSAD, PIRADS score and PHI; with an AUC curve calculated for all criteria and a combination of PIRADS score and PHI. Subsequent sub-analyses included patients undergoing first and repeat biopsy.  Results:   The AUC for predicting the presence of csPCa in all patients was 59.5 for total PSA, 69.7 for PHI, 64.9 for PSAD and 62.5 for PIRADS. In biopsy naive patients it was 61.6 for total PSA, 68.9 for PHI, 64.6 for PSAD and 63.1 for PIRADS. In patients with previous negative biopsy the AUC for total PSA, PHI, PSAD and PIRADS was 55.4, 71.2, 64.4 and 69.3, respectively. Adding of PHI to PIRADS increased significantly (p = 0.007) the accuracy for prediction of csPCa.  Conclusion:   Prostate Health Index could serve as a tool in predicting csPCa.

Prostate specific antigen (PSA), used as a biomarker for prostate-related diseases, was selected as a target glycoprotein. Surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerisation from template PSA immobilised the substrate with a functional monomer possessing a phenyl boronic acid group, where the template PSA was designed to possess polymerisation groups aligned with disulphide linkage. Using the thiol groups left after removing templates, PIR could be introduced as the 1st PIM. An evaluation of the effect of crosslinking density and blocking treatment on selective detection indicated that highly selective and sensitive detection of PSA was achieved. Furthermore, the 2nd PIM to introduce fluorescent molecules into the nanocavities led to the fluorescent detection of PSA.

However, the performance of such systems can degrade in the presence of artifacts, foreign tissue, or other anomalies. Pathologists integrating their expertise with feedback from an AI system could result in a synergy that outperforms both the individual pathologist and the system. Despite the hype around AI assistance, existing literature on this topic within the pathology domain is limited. We investigated the value of AI assistance for grading prostate biopsies. A panel of 14 observers graded 160 biopsies with and without AI assistance.

Our institution transitioned to a preference for multiparametric MRI-based triage and TP biopsy since 2014. The aim of this study was to compare clinical, microbiological and health economic outcomes between TR and TP prostate biopsy.  Methods:   A consecutive cohort study considered prostate biopsies over an 11 year period. Hospital presentations across the region within 30 days of biopsy were analysed for details and subsequent outcomes according to biopsy approach. Cost for each encounter (routine and unplanned) were analysed and generalised linear models applied, as well as cost implications for inclusion of mpMRI-based triage and TP biopsy preference.  Results:   In total, 2048 prostate biopsies were performed. Similar re-presentation rates per occurred for each biopsy approach (90 patients, TR 4.8%, TP 3.8%, p = 0.29), with 23 patients presenting more than once (119 total presentations). Presentations after TR biopsy were more likely to be of infectious aetiology (TR 2.92%, TP 0.26% de novo, p < 0.001) and result in hospital admission (TR 43/49, 93.4%; TP 14/24, 58.3%; p = 0.007) for similar rates of urinary retention (TR 2.76% vs TP 3.63%, p = 1). The mean overall cost (biopsy and re-presentations) was higher for the TP group (p < 0.001), adjusted for year and age, but reduced over time and was similar for patients who re-presented (p = 0.98). Incorporation of mpMRI (with subsequently avoided biopsies), TP biopsy and re-presentations resulted in AU$783.27 saving per biopsy.  Conclusions:   TR biopsy resulted in more infectious complications and hospital admissions than TP biopsy for similar rates of re-presentation and urinary retention. TP biopsy costs reduced over time and use in conjunction with mpMRI provides an overall cost saving. Routine TP biopsy is safe and feasible, with further cost savings expected with other approaches (local anaesthetic) under investigation.""","""['Matthew J Roberts', 'Alastair Macdonald', 'Sachinka Ranasinghe', 'Harrison Bennett', 'Patrick E Teloken', 'Patrick Harris', 'David Paterson', 'Geoff Coughlin', 'Nigel Dunglison', 'Rachel Esler', 'Robert A Gardiner', 'Thomas Elliott', 'Louisa Gordon', 'John Yaxley']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Transperineal Versus Transrectal MRI/TRUS Fusion Targeted Biopsy: Detection Rate of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', 'Do cancer detection rates differ between transperineal and transrectal micro-ultrasound mpMRI-fusion-targeted prostate biopsies?

Second-generation AR antagonists are effective against some of these castration-resistant prostate cancers, but their structural variety is still limited. In this study, we designed and synthesized 4-methyl-7-(N-alkyl-arylcarboxamido)coumarins as AR antagonist candidates and evaluated their growth-inhibitory activity toward androgen-dependent SC-3 cells. Coumarinamides with a secondary amide bond did not show inhibitory activity, but their N-methylated derivatives exhibited AR-antagonistic activity. Especially, 19b and 31b were more potent than the lead compound 7b, which was comparable to hydroxyflutamide (2b). Conformational analysis showed that the inactive coumarinamides with a secondary amide bond have an extended structure with a trans-amide bond, while the active N-methylated coumarinamides have a folded structure with a cis-amide bond, in which the two aromatic rings are placed face-to-face. Docking study suggested that this folded structure is important for binding to AR.

In this work, we set up an experimental methodology for the fabrication of GO@peptide hybrids by the immobilization, via irreversible physical adsorption, of the Ac-(GHHPH)4-NH2 peptide sequence, known to mimic the anti-angiogenic domain of the histidine-proline-rich glycoprotein (HPRG). The anti-proliferative capability of the graphene-peptide hybrids were tested in vitro by viability assays on prostate cancer cells (PC-3 line), human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y), and human retinal endothelial cells (primary HREC). The anti-angiogenic response of the two cellular models of angiogenesis, namely endothelial and prostate cancer cells, was scrutinized by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release and wound scratch assays, to correlate the activation of inflammatory response upon the cell treatments with the GO@peptide nanocomposites to the cell migration processes. Results showed that the GO@peptide nanoassemblies not only effectively induced toxicity in the prostate cancer cells, but also strongly blocked the cell migration and inhibited the prostaglandin-mediated inflammatory process both in PC-3 and in HRECs. Moreover, the cytotoxic mechanism and the internalization efficiency of the theranostic nanoplatforms, investigated by mitochondrial ROS production analyses and confocal microscopy imaging, unraveled a dose-dependent manifold mechanism of action performed by the hybrid nanoassemblies against the PC-3 cells, with the detection of the GO-characteristic cell wrapping and mitochondrial perturbation.

It is a first attempt to use both network structure and node attributes to learn feature representation for the genes in the network. Then it leverages these feature vectors to divide the genes into several subgroups. Finally, potential cancer driver genes are prioritized according to ranking scores that measure both genes' properties and their importance in the subgroups. We apply our method to predict driver genes for lung cancer, breast cancer and prostate cancer.

Although observed survival estimates are unavailable for many countries, where they are available, wide variations are reported. Understanding the impact of specific treatment and imaging modalities can help decision makers to effectively allocate resources to improve cancer survival in their local context.  Methods:   We developed a microsimulation model of stage-specific cancer survival in 200 countries and territories for 11 cancers (oesophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, anus, liver, pancreas, lung, breast, cervix uteri, and prostate) comprising 60% of global diagnosed cancer cases. The model accounts for country-specific availability of treatment (chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, and targeted therapy) and imaging modalities (ultrasound, x-ray, CT, MRI, PET, single-photon emission CT), as well as quality of care. We calibrated the model to reported survival estimates from CONCORD-3 (which reports global trends in cancer survival in 2000-14). We estimated 5-year net survival for diagnosed cancers in each country or territory and estimated potential survival gains from increasing the availability of individual treatment and imaging modalities, and more comprehensive packages of scale-up of these interventions. We report the mean and 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for all outcomes, calculated as the 2·5 and 97·5 percentiles of the simulation results.  Findings:   The estimated global 5-year net survival for all 11 cancers combined is 42·6% (95% uncertainty interval 40·3-44·3), with survival in high-income countries being an average of 12 times (range 4-17) higher than that in low-income countries. Expanding availability of surgery or radiotherapy or improving quality of care would yield the largest survival gains in low-income (2·5-3·4 percentage point increase in survival) and lower-middle-income countries (2·4-6·1 percentage point increase), whereas upper-middle-income and high-income countries are more likely to benefit from improved availability of targeted therapy (0·7 percentage point increase for upper-middle income and 0·4 percentage point increase for high income). Investing in medical imaging will also be necessary to achieve substantial survival gains, with traditional modalities estimated to provide the largest gains in low-income settings, while MRI and PET would yield the largest gains in higher-income countries. Simultaneous expansion of treatment, imaging, and quality of care could improve 5-year net survival by more than ten times in low-income countries (3·8% [95% UI 0·5-9·2] to 45·2% [40·2-52·1]) and could more than double 5-year net survival in lower-middle-income countries (20·1% [7·2-31·7] to 47·1% [42·8-50·8]).  Interpretation:   Scaling up both treatment and imaging availability could yield synergistic survival gains for patients with cancer. Expanding traditional modalities in lower-income settings might be a feasible pathway to improve survival before scaling up more modern technologies.

Objective:   To evaluate the safety and activity of 177Lu PSMA 617 (LuPSMA-617) in combination with idronoxil suppositories (NOX66) in patients with end-stage mCRPC.  Design, setting, and participants:   Thirty-two men with progressive mCRPC previously treated with taxane-based chemotherapy (91% treated with both docetaxel and cabazitaxel) and abiraterone and/or enzalutamide were enrolled in this phase I dose escalation study with phase II dose expansion.  Intervention:   Screening with 68Ga PSMA and 18F-fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) was performed. Men received up to six cycles of LuPSMA-617 (7.5 GBq) on day 1, with escalating doses of NOX66 on days 1-10 of a 6-wk cycle. Cohort 1 (n = 8) received 400 mg and cohort 2 (n = 24) 800 mg of NOX66.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Adverse events (AEs), pain inventory scores, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, progression-free survival, and overall survival were evaluated.  Results and limitations:   Fifty-six men were screened and 32 (57%) were enrolled with a screen failure rate of 21% for PET imaging criteria. Dosing was as follows: 97% (31/32) received two or more doses and 47% (15/32) completed six doses. Common AEs included xerostomia, fatigue, and anaemia. Anal irritation attributable to NOX66 occurred in 28%. PSA responses were as follows: 91% (29/32) had any PSA response (median -74%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 76-97) and 62.5% (20/32) had a PSA fall of >50% (95% CI 45-77). The median PSA progression-free survival was 6.1 mo (95% CI 2.8-9.2) and median overall survival was 17.1 mo (95% CI 6.5-27.1).

We studied our experience with high grade malignant SFT of the prostate to address the degree of histological and immunophenotypical overlap with sarcomatoid carcinoma and prostatic stromal sarcoma. Four cases were identified from the surgical pathology consultation archives. All available H&E stained sections were reviewed. Immunostains for STAT6, CAM5.2, NKX3.1, PAX-8, GATA3, high molecular weight cytokeratin (34BE12), p40, and p63 were performed on available material. Each case was evaluated by three separate SFT prognostic risk models based on clinicopathological features, and for features of 'dedifferentiated SFT'. The patient's ages were 49, 55, 69, and 73 years. Three presented with symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia and one with haematuria. Tumour sizes were 5, 9, 13, and 13 cm. Mitotic rate ranged from 6 to 20 mitoses per 10 high power fields, and two cases showed abrupt transition from conventional SFT to areas with marked nuclear pleomorphism/anaplasia (i.e., 'de-differentiation'). Immunophenotypically, all four cases had strong and diffuse nuclear reactivity for STAT6. For other markers, three of three had both focal PR and GATA3 nuclear expression (up to 30% of cells). One case with 'dedifferentiated' features showed expression of multiple epithelial markers, including EMA (focal), high molecular weight cytokeratin (focal), p63, and p40. In summary, malignant SFT may rarely occur in the prostate and may closely mimic sarcomatoid carcinoma or prostatic stromal sarcoma, both histologically and immunophenotypically. Consideration of the diagnostic possibility of malignant SFT, recognition of unexpected GATA3 and PR expression, and utilisation of monoclonal STAT6 immunohistochemistry facilitate appropriate diagnosis at this unusual anatomical site.""","""['Ahmed Bakhshwin', 'Ryan S Berry', 'Roni M Cox', 'Roger Li', 'Jordan P Reynolds', 'Brian P Rubin', 'Jesse K McKenney']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Pathology""","""['The utility of STAT6 and ALDH1 expression in the differential diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumor versus prostate-specific stromal neoplasms.', 'Primary solitary fibrous tumour of the prostate: A case report and literature review.', 'Extrapleural solitary fibrous tumor with uncommon histology: a clinicopathologic analysis of 7 cases.', 'Nuclear expression of STAT6 distinguishes solitary fibrous tumor from histologic mimics.', 'A rare case of malignant solitary fibrous tumor in prostate with review of the literature.', 'Solitary Fibrous Tumor of the Prostate: A Case Report and Literature Review.', 'Re-evaluating tumors of purported specialized prostatic stromal origin reveals molecular heterogeneity, including non-recurring gene fusions characteristic of uterine and soft tissue sarcoma subtypes.']"""

Methods:   Men with newly diagnosed biopsy-proven PCa who had been staged with a conventional staging protocol including bone scintigraphy (BS) and additionally underwent [68Ga]PSMA PET/CT, were evaluated retrospectively. Imaging findings from BS, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or CT were categorized regarding locoregional nodal (N) and distant metastasis (M) status as negative, positive or equivocal before and after addition of the information of PET/CT. Also, the imaging-based level of confidence (LoC) in correct assessment of N and M status was scored. Impact of PET/CT on clinical management was evaluated by the percentage of treatment category changes after PET/CT as determined in the multidisciplinary tumour board.  Results:   Sixty-four men with intermediate and high-risk PCa were evaluated. With additional information of PET/CT, N status was upstaged in 23%, and downstaged in 9%.

Tumor heterogeneity is the basis of drug resistance in various cancer treatments, and DNA methylation plays a core role in the generation of tumor heterogeneity. Almost all types of cancer cells are associated with abnormal DNA methylation in certain regions of the genome. The selection of tumor-related differential methylation sites, which can be used as an indicator of tumor purity, has important implications for purity assessment. At present, the selection of information sites mostly focuses on inter-tumor heterogeneity and ignores the heterogeneity of tumor growth space that is sample specificity. Results: Considering the specificity of tumor samples and the information gain of individual tumor sample relative to the normal samples, we present an approach, PESM, to evaluate the tumor purity through the specificity difference methylation sites of tumor samples. Applied to more than 200 tumor samples of Prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) and Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), it shows that the tumor purity estimated by PESM is highly consistent with other existing methods. In addition, PESM performs better than the method that uses the integrated signal of methylation sites to estimate purity.

The rate of urologist-radiologist recalls for each report type was calculated.  Results:   Reports B and C including its subtypes had higher ratings of satisfaction than report A for overall satisfaction degree, and parameters of correctness, practicality, and subjectivity (p < 0.05). There was a significant difference between report B and C (p < 0.05) in practicality score, but no statistical difference was found in overall satisfaction degree, and correctness and subjectivity scores (p > 0.05). Compared with report C-b (p > 0.05), report B and C-a (p < 0.05) showed a significant difference in overall satisfaction degree and parameters of practicality and subjectivity. In terms of correctness score, neither report C-a nor C-b had a significant difference with report B (p > 0.05). No statistical difference was found between report C-a and C-b in overall satisfaction degree and all three parameters (p > 0.05). The rate of urologist-radiologist recalls for reports A, B, C-a and C-b were 29.1%, 10.8%, 18.1% and 11.2%, respectively.  Conclusion:   Structured reports, either using TNM or PI-RADS are highly preferred over conventional free-text reports and lead to fewer report-related post-hoc inquiries from urologists.""","""['Jinman Zhong', 'Weijun Qin', 'Yu Li', 'Yang Wang', 'Yi Huan', 'Jing Ren']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Korean J Radiol""","""[""A Comparison of Radiologists' and Urologists' Opinions Regarding Prostate MRI Reporting: Results From a Survey of Specialty Societies."", 'Prostate MRI evolution in clinical practice: Audit of tumour detection and staging versus prostatectomy with staged introduction of multiparametric MRI and Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System v2 reporting.', 'Structured reporting of prostate magnetic resonance imaging has the potential to improve interdisciplinary communication.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging for prostate cancer: what the urologist needs to know.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.']"""

Cancer stem cells (CSCs), contributing majorly to the chemoresistance and tumor relapse, seem to the main culprits. In the present investigation, new chemical entities (NCEs) belonging to four novel chemical series (A: 4'-allyl-2'-methoxyphenoxymethyl-1,2,3-triazoles; B: 4'-acetamidophenoxymethyl-1,2,3-triazoles; C: naphthalene-1'-yloxymethyl-1,2,3-triazoles, and D: naphthalene-2'-yloxymethyl-1,2,3-triazoles) were synthesized via Copper (I)-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition reaction and evaluated for in vitro anticancer activity. A total of 30 NCEs (39-68) were screened at 10 μM concentration in cell viability assay against cancer cell lines such as breast (MDA-MB-231), prostate (PC-3), glioma (U87 MG), along with cervical (SiHa) and lung (A549). The NCEs from Series C (56-60) and D (61-68) were more potent than those in Series A (39-45) and Series B (46-55) at the tested concentration. Furthermore, NCEs with >80% inhibition at 10 μM were evaluated for dose response. A total of five NCEs, 48, 56, 61, 65 and 66, were further assessed in soft-agar assay and found to be relatively potent (IC50 < 10 μM). Finally, the hits were screened in sphere assay to identify potential CSC inhibitors against mammospheres (MDA-MB-231) and prostatospheres (PC-3). More so, the hits were also evaluated to understand in vitro cytotoxicity against normal cells using mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line (NIH/3T3) and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs). Overall, hits 56 and 61 exhibited potent anticancer as well as CSC inhibitory activities with notably less toxicity toward NIH/3T3 and hPBMCs.

However, patients only benefit from enzalutamide for a short period of time as resistance may develop. Therefore, it is vital to develop a novel strategy to overcome enzalutamide resistance. Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1), which is commonly upregulated in human cancer types, has been recognized as a key molecular component in tumorigenesis, invasion and metastasis. However, the role of Rac1 in enzalutamide-resistance in prostate cancer (PCa) remains unknown. In the present study, Rac1 was demonstrated to be upregulated in enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells, and Rac1 knockdown inhibited enzalutamide-resistant cell proliferation and colony formation. Western blotting results indicated that enzalutamide treatment downregulated the expression levels of JNK and activated transcription factor 2, as well as enhanced the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and induced cleavage of poly-ADP ribose polymerase. Moreover, knockdown of Rac1 in MR49F cells significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion via the downregulation of Snail and the upregulation of E-cadherin. The results of a nude mouse xenograft tumor model using 22RV1 cells demonstrated that enzalutamide inhibited tumor growth after Rac1 knockdown dramatically, compared to vehicle and single treatment groups. Therefore, the present study provided novel evidence that Rac1 may serve a crucial role in enzalutamide resistance, and that targeting Rac1 may be a potential approach for the treatment of CRPC.""","""['Xiaoliang Chen', 'Lili Yin', 'Gan Qiao', 'Yanhua Li', 'Baoyuan Li', 'Yunfeng Bai', 'Feng Feng']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Oncol Lett""","""['Knockdown of RhoA Expression Reverts Enzalutamide Resistance via the p38 MAPK Pathway in Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Identification of key enzalutamide-resistance-related genes in castration-resistant prostate cancer and verification of RAD51 functions.', 'Snail promotes cell migration through PI3K/AKT-dependent Rac1 activation as well as PI3K/AKT-independent pathways during prostate cancer progression.', 'Enzalutamide-resistant castration-resistant prostate cancer: challenges and solutions.', 'Enzalutamide for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Rac1 as a Target to Treat Dysfunctions and Cancer of the Bladder.', '(+)-JJ-74-138 is a Novel Noncompetitive Androgen Receptor Antagonist.', 'Inferring Differential Networks by Integrating Gene Expression Data With Additional Knowledge.', 'Androgen deprivation‑induced OPHN1 amplification promotes castration‑resistant prostate cancer.', 'The PTEN Conundrum: How to Target PTEN-Deficient Prostate Cancer.']"""

This study utilizes the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor registry to evaluate variations in survival based on initial treatment received by men with metastatic disease at diagnosis or after progression.  Materials and methods:   Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor is a national registry of men diagnosed with CaP and managed at 43 community, academic, and Veteran's centers. We examined socio-demographic factors, disease biology, initial and subsequent therapy received, and survival among patients who presented with de novo or recurrent metastatic disease stratified by receipt of initial local therapy vs. combined local and hormonal therapy. The outcome was prostate cancer specific mortality (PCSM). We performed Fine and Gray competing risks regression analysis to evaluate the association between timing of metastasis and PCSM, adjusted for age, initial treatment, and subsequent therapy.  Results:   Of the 14,753 patients diagnosed with CaP from 1990 to 2016, 669 (5%) had metastatic disease. Among the examined patients, 303 (45%) had metastatic disease at diagnosis and 366 (55%) progressed to metastatic disease. Overall, 461 (69%) were ≥65 years old, 582 (87%) had Medicare, and 227 (34%) had an annual income < $30,000. Prostate-specific antigen at diagnosis was >20 ng/ml for 342 (51%) patients and biopsy Gleason grade was ≥4 + 3 for 386 (58%) patients. Among patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis, 31 (10%) received initial local therapy and 272 (90%) received initial hormonal therapy. Among patients who progressed to metastatic disease, 239 (65%) received initial local therapy and 127 (35%) received initial systemic hormonal therapy. Among patients with metastatic disease, the multivariate competing risks model, after adjusting for sociodemographics, marital status, diagnosis year, and comorbidities, revealed a significantly lower risk of PCSM among patients with de novo vs. recurrent metastatic disease (Hazard Ratio 0.66 (95% Confidence Interval 0.51, 0.85) P = 0.002). In the stratified analysis, no difference was seen for patients treated with initial hormonal vs. combined local and hormonal therapy.  Conclusions:   In this analysis of a nationwide cohort of men treated for CaP with all types of therapy over 25 years, we observed that among men with metastatic CaP, the risk of PCSM was lower for de novo vs. recurrent metastatic disease.

Stage at presentation and treatment rates, as well as multivariably adjusted and matched CSM rates according to TNM stage within each histologic subtype, were reported.  Results:   Of all 222,435 eligible patients with BCa, 11,147 (5.0%) harbored VH. Among those, squamous cell carcinoma accounted for 3666 (1.6%) patients, adenocarcinoma for 1862 (0.8%), neuroendocrine carcinoma for 1857 (0.8%), and other VH BCa for 3762 (1.7%) of the study cohort. Patients with VH BCa showed invariably more advanced TNM stage at presentation compared with patients with UCUB. Treatment rates according to TNM stages showed similar distribution of cystectomy rates in VH BCa and UCUB. However, important differences in the distribution of radiotherapy and chemotherapy rates existed within VH BCa and in comparison with UCUB. Furthermore, even after multivariable adjustment and matching with UCUB, squamous cell carcinoma exhibited higher CSM (hazard ratios, 1.43-1.95; all P < .01) across all stages. All other VH predominantly exhibited higher CSM than UCUB in either non-muscle-invasive or muscle-invasive nonmetastatic stages.

Eupatilin is a secondary metabolite of Artemisia asiatica and has shown potential anti-tumor activity in some cancers, but its potential in prostate cancer treatment has not yet been evaluated.  Objective:   The aim of the study was to investigate the effectiveness of eupatilin on prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration.  Methods:   Human prostate cancer PC3 and LNCaP cells were exposed to eupatilin and its efficacy on cell survival was determined by the MTT test. Apoptosis and cell cycle phases were evaluated by an image-based cytometer. Cell migration and invasion were evaluated by wound healing and matrigel migration assays; the expression of mRNA and protein was assessed by RT-qPCR and Western blot, respectively.  Results:   Eupatilin time- and dose-dependently reduced the viability of prostate cancer cells. Exposure of PC3 cells to 12.5μM-50μM eupatilin resulted in apoptosis by upregulating the expression of caspase 3, Bax and cytochrome c. Annexin V assessment also confirmed that eupatilin causes apoptosis. The treatment significantly upregulated the mRNA expression of p53, p21, and p27, causing cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. Administration of eupatilin inhibited migration and invasion of the cells by downregulating the expression of Twist, Slug and MMP-2, -7. In addition, the agent increased protein expression of tumor suppressor PTEN, while transcription factor NF-κB expression was reduced.

Key findings:   EGCG inhibited DU145 and PC3 proliferation with IC50 = 46 and 56 μM, respectively, and induced dose-dependent peaks of internal Ca2+ that were dependent on extracellular Ca2+. The expression of TRPC4 and TRPC6 channels was revealed by qPCR in PC3 cells, but lack of effect by modulators and blockers ruled out an exclusive role for these, as well as for voltage-dependent T-type Ca2+ channels. Application of dithiothreitol and catalase and sulfhydryl (SH) measurements showed that EGCG-induced Ca2+ rise depends on SH oxidation, while the effect of EGTA, dantrolene, and the PLC inhibitor U73122 suggested that EGCG-induced Ca2+ influx acts as a trigger for Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, involving both ryanodine and IP3 receptors. Different from EGCG, ATP caused a rapid Ca2+ increase, which was independent of external Ca2+, but sensitive to U73122.  Significance:   EGCG induces an internal Ca2+ increase in PCa cells by a multi-step mechanism. As dysregulation of cytosolic Ca2+ is directly linked to apoptosis in PCa cells, these data confirm the possibility of using EGCG as a synergistic adjuvant in combined therapies for recalcitrant malignancies like androgen-independent PCa.""","""['Carla Marchetti', 'Paola Gavazzo', 'Bruno Burlando']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Life Sci""","""['(-)-Epigallocatechin gallate attenuates glutamate-induced cytotoxicity via intracellular Ca modulation in PC12 cells.', 'Growth inhibition, cell-cycle dysregulation, and induction of apoptosis by green tea constituent (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate in androgen-sensitive and androgen-insensitive human prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Epigallocatechin-3-gallate induces mesothelioma cell death via H2 O2 -dependent T-type Ca2+ channel opening.', 'Cell signaling and regulators of cell cycle as molecular targets for prostate cancer prevention by dietary agents.', 'Molecular targets for green tea in prostate cancer prevention.', 'A Comprehensive Review on Beneficial Effects of Catechins on Secondary Mitochondrial Diseases.', 'Prostate cancer: Therapeutic prospect with herbal medicine.', ""IDH1 R132C and ERC2 L309I Mutations Contribute to the Development of Maffucci's Syndrome."", 'Epigallocatechin 3-gallate inhibits the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase: effects on calcium homeostasis.']"""

This results in AKT serine/threonine kinase (Akt) activation, membrane focal adhesion turnover, and increased epithelial cell migration. RNA sequencing profiling identified integrin-linked kinase (ILK) as the most upregulated pathway in sEV-treated epithelial cells, and genetic or pharmacologic targeting of ILK reversed mitochondrial reprogramming and suppressed sEV-induced cell movements. In a three-dimensional (3D) model of mammary gland morphogenesis, sEV treatment induced hallmarks of malignant transformation, with deregulated cell death and/or cell proliferation, loss of apical-basal polarity, and appearance of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers.

RAD9 stabilizes the genome, but prostate cancer cells and tumors often have high quantities of the protein. Reduction of RAD9 level within prostate cancer cells decreases tumorigenicity of nude mouse xenographs and metastasis phenotypes in culture, indicating that RAD9 overproduction is essential for the disease. In prostate cancer DU145 cells, CpG hypermethylation in a transcription suppressor site of RAD9 intron 2 causes high-level gene expression. Herein, we demonstrate that DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3B are highly abundant in prostate cancer cells DU145, CWR22, LNCaP and PC-3; yet, these DNMTs bind primarily to the transcription suppressor in DU145, the only cells where methylation is critical for RAD9 regulation. For DU145 cells, DNMT1 or DNMT3B shRNA reduced RAD9 level and tumorigenicity, and RAD9 ectopic expression restored this latter activity in the DNMT knockdown cells. High levels of RAD9, DNMT1, DNMT3B and RAD9 transcription suppressor hypermethylation were significantly correlated in prostate tumors, and not in normal prostate tissues. Based on these results, we propose a novel model where RAD9 is regulated epigenetically by DNMT1 and DNMT3B, via targeted hypermethylation, and that consequent RAD9 overproduction promotes prostate tumorigenesis.""","""['Aiping Zhu', 'Kevin M Hopkins', 'Richard A Friedman', 'Joshua D Bernstock', 'Constantinos G Broustas', 'Howard B Lieberman']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Carcinogenesis""","""['Rad9 has a functional role in human prostate carcinogenesis.', 'Mahanine restores RASSF1A expression by down-regulating DNMT1 and DNMT3B in prostate cancer cells.', 'Tumor suppressor gene inactivation during cadmium-induced malignant transformation of human prostate cells correlates with overexpression of de novo DNA methyltransferase.', 'DNA methyltransferases in hematological malignancies.', 'Interplay between DNA Methyltransferase 1 and microRNAs During Tumorigenesis.', 'GSK-3484862 targets DNMT1 for degradation in cells.', 'RBM14 as a novel epigenetic-activated tumor oncogene is implicated in the reprogramming of glycolysis in lung cancer.', 'Consistent DNA Hypomethylations in Prostate Cancer.', 'A cellular senescence-related gene prognostic index for biochemical recurrence and drug resistance in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Emerging role of different DNA methyltransferases in the pathogenesis of cancer.']"""

When used in lieu of simulators, emulators can expedite tasks that require many repeated evaluations, such as sensitivity analyses, policy optimization, model calibration, and value-of-information analyses. Emulators are developed using the output of simulators at specific input values (design points). Developing an emulator that closely approximates the simulator can require many design points, which becomes computationally expensive. We describe a self-terminating active learning algorithm to efficiently develop emulators tailored to a specific emulation task, and compare it with algorithms that optimize geometric criteria (random latin hypercube sampling and maximum projection designs) and other active learning algorithms (treed Gaussian Processes that optimize typical active learning criteria). We compared the algorithms' root mean square error (RMSE) and maximum absolute deviation from the simulator (MAX) for seven benchmark functions and in a prostate cancer screening model. In the empirical analyses, in simulators with greatly varying smoothness over the input domain, active learning algorithms resulted in emulators with smaller RMSE and MAX for the same number of design points. In all other cases, all algorithms performed comparably. The proposed algorithm attained satisfactory performance in all analyses, had smaller variability than the treed Gaussian Processes, and, on average, had similar or better performance as the treed Gaussian Processes in six out of seven benchmark functions and in the prostate cancer model.""","""['Alexandra G Ellis', 'Rowan Iskandar', 'Christopher H Schmid', 'John B Wong', 'Thomas A Trikalinos']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Stat Med""","""['Reliable emulation of complex functionals by active learning with error control.', 'A comparison of statistical emulation methodologies for multi-wave calibration of environmental models.', 'Evaluating Parameter Uncertainty in a Simulation Model of Cancer Using Emulators.', 'Large-Scale Neuromorphic Spiking Array Processors: A Quest to Mimic the Brain.', 'Methods for training of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Emulator-based Bayesian calibration of the CISNET colorectal cancer models.', 'Probability bound analysis: A novel approach for quantifying parameter uncertainty in decision-analytic modeling and cost-effectiveness analysis.']"""

The primary objective was to assess the effect of epeleuton on markers of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with post hoc analyses of cardiometabolic markers. Methods and Results In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 96 adults with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and body mass index 25 to 40 were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive epeleuton 2 g/day, epeleuton 1 g/day, or placebo for 16 weeks. A total of 27% of patients had diabetes mellitus. Primary end points of changes in alanine aminotransferase and liver stiffness did not improve at week 16. Secondary and post hoc analyses investigated changes in cardiometabolic markers. Epeleuton 2 g/day significantly decreased triglycerides, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total cholesterol without increasing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Despite a low mean baseline hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C; 6.3±1.3%), epeleuton 2 g/day significantly decreased HbA1c (-0.4%; P=0.026). Among patients with baseline HbA1c >6.5%, epeleuton 2 g/day decreased HbA1c by 1.1% (P=0.047; n=26). Consistent dose-dependent reductions were observed for fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance indices. Epeleuton 2 g/day decreased circulating markers of cardiovascular risk and endothelial dysfunction. Epeleuton was well tolerated, with a safety profile not different from placebo. Conclusions While epeleuton did not meet its primary end points on alanine aminotransferase or liver stiffness, it significantly decreased triglycerides, HbA1C, plasma glucose, and inflammatory markers. These data suggest epeleuton may have potential for cardiovascular risk reduction and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease by simultaneously targeting hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, and systemic inflammation.

All men underwent a unique rapid biparametric magnetic resonance imaging (IMPROD bpMRI) consisting of T2-weighted imaging and three separate DWI acquisitions. Men with IMPROD bpMRI Likert scores of 3-5 were included. Logistic regression models were developed using IMPROD trial (n = 122) and validated using MULTI-IMPROD trial (n = 262) data. The model's performance was evaluated in the terms of PCa detection with Gleason Grade Group 1 (clinically insignificant prostate cancer, iPCa) and > 1 (clinically significant prostate cancer, csPCa). Net benefits and decision curve analyses (DCA) were compared. Combined biopsies were used for reference.  Results:   The developed nomogram included age, PSA, prostate volume, MRI suspicion score (IMPROD bpMRI Likert or PIRADsv2.1 score), MRI-suspicion lesion volume percentage, and lesion location.

To identify the cognate inhibitor of TMPRSS2, in this study, we applied co-immunoprecipitation and LC/MS/MS analysis and isolated hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitors (HAIs) to be potential inhibitor candidates for TMPRSS2. Moreover, the recombinant HAI-2 proteins exhibited a better inhibitory effect on TMPRSS2 proteolytic activity than HAI-1, and recombinant HAI-2 proteins had a high affinity to form a complex with TMPRSS2. The immunofluorescence images further showed that TMPRSS2 was co-localized to HAI-2. Both KD1 and KD2 domain of HAI-2 showed comparable inhibitory effects on TMPRSS2 proteolytic activity. In addition, HAI-2 overexpression could suppress the induction effect of TMPRSS2 on pro-HGF activation, extracellular matrix degradation and prostate cancer cell invasion. We further determined that the expression levels of TMPRSS2 were inversely correlated with HAI-2 levels during prostate cancer progression. In orthotopic xenograft animal model, TMPRSS2 overexpression promoted prostate cancer metastasis, and HAI-2 overexpression efficiently blocked TMPRSS2-induced metastasis. In summary, the results together indicate that HAI-2 can function as a cognate inhibitor for TMPRSS2 in human prostate cancer cells and may serve as a potential factor to suppress TMPRSS2-mediated malignancy.""","""['Chun-Jung Ko#', 'Ting-Wei Hsu#', 'Shang-Ru Wu', 'Shao-Wei Lan', 'Ting-Feng Hsiao', 'Hsin-Ying Lin', 'Hsin-Hsien Lin', 'Hsin-Fang Tu', 'Cheng-Fan Lee', 'Cheng-Chung Huang', 'Mei-Ju May Chen', 'Pei-Wen Hsiao', 'Hsiang-Po Huang', 'Ming-Shyue Lee']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['The Kunitz Domain I of Hepatocyte Growth Factor Activator Inhibitor-2 Inhibits Matriptase Activity and Invasive Ability of Human Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Hepatocyte growth factor activation inhibitors (HAI-1 and HAI-2) regulate HGF-induced invasion of human breast cancer cells.', 'Loss of hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type 1 participates in metastatic spreading of human pancreatic cancer cells in a mouse orthotopic transplantation model.', 'Hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type‑1 in cancer: advances and perspectives (Review).', 'Roles of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) activator and HGF activator inhibitor in the pericellular activation of HGF/scatter factor.', 'Unravelling the Role of P300 and TMPRSS2 in Prostate Cancer: A Literature Review.', 'SARS-CoV-2 and gastrointestinal diseases.', 'PM2.5 promotes lung cancer progression through activation of the AhR-TMPRSS2-IL18 pathway.', 'Structure and activity of human TMPRSS2 protease implicated in SARS-CoV-2 activation.', 'Human Cell Organelles in SARS-CoV-2 Infection: An Up-to-Date Overview.']"""

The effect of delaying biopsies of suspicious prostate mpMRI lesions is uncertain and clinically relevant during the COVID-19 crisis. We evaluated the association between biopsy delay time and pathologic findings on subsequent prostate biopsy.  Materials and methods:   After obtaining IRB approval we reviewed the medical records of 214 patients who underwent image-guided transperineal fusion biopsy of the prostate biopsy between 2017 and 2019. Study outcomes included clinically significant (ISUP grade group ≥2) and any prostate cancer on biopsy. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between biopsy delay time and outcomes while adjusting for known predictors of cancer on biopsy.  Results:   The study cohort included 195 men with a median age of 68. Median delay between mpMRI and biopsy was 5 months, and 90% of patients had a ≤8 months delay. A significant association was found between PI-RADS 5 lesions and no previous biopsies and shorter delay time. Delay time was not associated with clinically significant or any cancer on biopsy. A higher risk of significant cancer was associated with older age (P = 0.008), higher PSA (0.003), smaller prostate volume (<0.001), no previous biopsy (0.012) and PI-RADS 5 lesions (0.015).  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that under current practice, where men with PI-RADS 5 lesions and no previous biopsies undergo earlier evaluation, a delay of up to 8 months between imaging and biopsy does not affect biopsy findings. In the current COVID-19 crisis, selectively delaying image-guided prostate biopsies is unlikely to result in a higher rate of significant cancer.""","""['Ziv Savin', 'Snir Dekalo', 'Ron Marom', 'Sophie Barnes', 'Gilad Gitstein', 'Nicola J Mabjeesh', 'Haim Matzkin', 'Ofer Yossepowitch', 'Gal Keren-Paz', 'Roy Mano']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Multicentre evaluation of targeted and systematic biopsies using magnetic resonance and ultrasound image-fusion guided transperineal prostate biopsy in patients with a previous negative biopsy.', 'Multicentre evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging supported transperineal prostate biopsy in biopsy-naïve men with suspicion of prostate cancer.', 'Central zone lesions on magnetic resonance imaging: Should we be concerned?', 'PARADIGM SHIFTS IN DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF LOCALIZED PROSTATE CANCER IN 2022.', 'A cross-section of UK prostate cancer diagnostics during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) era - a shifting paradigm?', 'Lessons learned after one year of COVID-19 from a urologist and radiotherapist view: A German survey on prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment.', 'Understanding the experiences of patients with cancers in hospitals during COVID-19 pandemic in China: A qualitative research study.']"""

Durvalumab (D) is a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) which inhibits binding of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) to its receptor. Tremelimumab (T) is a mAb directed against the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of combination of olaparib, durvalumab and tremelimumab in patients with a solid tumors with a mutation in homologous gene repair.  Methods:   This phase II study will assess the efficacy and safety of olaparib/D/T association in patients (n = 213) with several types of solid cancers (breast cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, endometrial cancer, prostate cancer and others) with at least one mutation in homologous repair genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, ATM, FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, CHEK2, RAD51, BARD1, MRE11, RAD50, NBS1, HDAC2), LKB1/STK11, INPP4B, STAG2, ERG, CHEK1, BLM, LIG4, ATR, ATRX, CDK12). Good performance status patients and corresponding to specific inclusion criteria of each cohort will be eligible. STEP1: Patients will receive olaparib 300 mg BID. In absence of progression after 6 weeks of olaparib, they will follow STEP 2 with olaparib and immunotherapy by durvalumab (1500 mg Q4W) + tremelimumab (75 mg IV Q4W) during 4 months and will further pursue durvalumab alone until disease progression, death, intolerable toxicity, or patient/investigator decision to stop (for a maximum duration of 24 months, and 36 months for ovarian cohort). Primary endpoint is safety and efficacy according to progression-free survival (PFS) of olaparib + immunotherapy (durvalumab + tremelimumab) during 4 months followed by durvalumab alone as maintenance in patients with solid cancers and in response or stable, after prior molecular target therapy by olaparib; secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR), response rate after 6 weeks of olaparib, safety of olaparib/durvalumab/tremelimumab association.

Prostate cancer (PC) screening allows for early-stage PC diagnosis, resulting in high rates of curative procedures such as radical prostatectomy. The main complications following surgery are urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. However, the exact numbers related to these morbidities are often missing due to brief interviews during consultations in the medical office. Therefore, the aim of this study was to create an app to determine whether response rates to pre- and post-surgical PC questionnaires will increase.  Methods:   The app was built using the IONIC framework system and provided to patients through a prospective randomized study. We included 100 patients divided into two groups: 1. first group used the app (n = 50); and 2. second group responded via validated printed questionnaires (control group) (n = 50). All patients received discharge counseling to respond to the questionnaires 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the procedure. The app group received verbal guidance on how monitoring would occur, received an SMS containing a username and password providing access to the system and received reminder alerts to respond to the questionnaires.  Results:   The new app is called UroHealth and is available for download in the Apple App Store or at www.urohealth.com.br. When we evaluated the response rates, we found that 42.9% of the patients answered the preoperative questionnaire in the app group, while 16% responded in the control group (p = 0.003). By the end of the follow-up, we found that 24.5% of the patients answered the questionnaire in the app group, while 4% responded in the control group (p = 0.003).  Conclusion:   This app enabled almost 6 times more patients to answer long-term follow-up questions after surgical procedures, providing high-quality information regarding morbidity related to treatment. Although our initial results indicate that this app may become a useful tool in obtaining more frequent and realistic answers, thus helping to improve surgical techniques, other ways of reaching the patient should be tested to achieve higher response rates.""","""['Leandro F Faria', 'Sabrina T Reis', 'Katia R Leite', 'José Arnaldo Shiomi da Cruz', 'Ruan Pimenta', 'Nayara I Viana', 'Gabriela Q Amaral', 'Gabriel A G D Santos', 'Daniel Ilias', 'Felipe Fakhouri', 'Geraldo Xavier', 'Miguel Srougi', 'Carlo Camargo Passerotti']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Comput Methods Programs Biomed""","""['Feasibility of a Mobile Health Application To Monitor Recovery and Patient-reported Outcomes after Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'The CPC Risk Calculator: A New App to Predict Prostate-specific Antigen Recurrence During Follow-up After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Short-term results after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy compared to open radical prostatectomy.', 'Functional results and treatment of functional dysfunctions after radical prostatectomy.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Construction and validation of a fatty acid metabolism-related gene signature for predicting prognosis and therapeutic response in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Mobile health (mHealth) interventions in prostate cancer survivorship: a scoping review.', 'Mobile Postoperative Symptom Intervention Tool and Biometric Monitoring After Radical Cystectomy: Pilot Study Evaluating Feasibility, Usability, and Potential Utility.', 'A Novel Risk Factor Model Based on Glycolysis-Associated Genes for Predicting the Prognosis of Patients With Prostate Cancer.']"""

Therefore, we aimed to identify regulatory regions important for the regulation of CAIII gene under hypoxic conditions in human prostate cancer cells (PC3). The present study, for the first time, demonstrated that the chemically mimicked hypoxic condition led to the induced CAIII mRNA and protein expression in prostate cancer cells. Transcriptional regulation of CAIII was investigated by transient transfection assay that indicates that the most active promoter activity was in the region of P2 -699/+86. Hypoxic condition also upregulates the basal activity of for P1;-941/+86 and P2;-699/+86 constructs containing putative Hypoxia Response Element (HRE) region located in -268/-252. EMSA analysis of HRE located in -268/-252 bases, showed one DNA-protein binding complexes. Competition assays indicated this complex is resulted from HIF1α interactions. In addition, site-directed mutagenesis of potential HIF1α binding sites diminished a DNA-protein complex.

Methods:   DICOM structure sets from approximately 1200 lung and prostate cancer patients across 40 treatment centers were used to build predictive models to automate the relabeling of clinically specified structure labels to standardized labels as defined by the American Association of Physics in Medicine's (AAPM) Task Group 263 (TG-263). Volumetric bitmaps were created based on the delineated volumes and were combined with associated bony anatomy data to build feature vectors. Feature reduction was performed with singular value decomposition and the resulting vectors were used for predicting the label of each structure using five different classifier algorithms on the Apache Spark platform with 5-fold cross-validation. Undersampling methods were used to deal with underlying class imbalance that hindered the performance of classifiers. Experiments were performed on both a curated version of the data, which included only annotated structures, and the non-curated data that included all structures from the original treatment plans.  Results:   Random Forest provided the highest accuracies with F1 scores of 98.77 for lung and 95.06 for prostate on the curated data sets. Scores were lower with 95.67 for lung and 90.22 for prostate on the non-curated data sets, highlighting some of the challenges of classifying real clinical data. Including bony anatomy data and pooling information from all structures for the same patient both increased accuracies. In some cases, undersampling with k-Means clustering for class balancing improved classifier accuracy but in all experiments it significantly reduced run time compared to random undersampling.  Conclusion:   This work shows that structure sets can be relabeled using our approach with accuracies over 95% for many structure types when presented with curated data. Although accuracies dropped when using the full non-curated data sets, some structure types were still correctly labeled over 90% of the time. With similar results obtained on an external test data set, we can infer that the proposed models are likely to work on other clinical data sets.""","""['William C Sleeman Iv', 'Joseph Nalluri', 'Khajamoinuddin Syed', 'Preetam Ghosh', 'Bartosz Krawczyk', 'Michael Hagan', 'Jatinder Palta', 'Rishabh Kapoor']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Biomed Inform""","""['Comparing Multiple Machine Learning Algorithms and Metrics for Estrogen Receptor Binding Prediction.', 'Evaluation of data discretization methods to derive platform independent isoform expression signatures for multi-class tumor subtyping.', 'Next-Generation Radiogenomics Sequencing for Prediction of EGFR and KRAS Mutation Status in NSCLC Patients Using Multimodal Imaging and Machine Learning Algorithms.', 'American Association of Physicists in Medicine Task Group 263: Standardizing Nomenclatures in Radiation Oncology.', 'A review of image analysis and machine learning techniques for automated cervical cancer screening from pap-smear images.', 'Standardising Breast Radiotherapy Structure Naming Conventions: A Machine Learning Approach.', 'Deep learning-based classification and structure name standardization for organ at risk and target delineations in prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Automated data abstraction for quality surveillance and outcome assessment in radiation oncology.', 'Multi-View Data Integration Methods for Radiotherapy Structure Name Standardization.']"""

The restoration uses energy-adaptation followed by a fast spot-intensity re-optimization. The full adaptation uses energy-adaptation followed by the addition of new spots and a range-robust spot-intensity optimization. Dose was prescribed as 55 Gy(RBE) to the low-dose target (lymph nodes and seminal vesicles) with a boost to 74 Gy(RBE) to the high-dose target (prostate). Daily patient set-up was simulated using implanted intra-prostatic markers.  Results:   Margins of 4 and 8 mm around the high- and low-dose target regions, a 6 mm setup error and a 3% range error were found to obtain adequate target coverage for all repeat CTs of 10/11 patients (94.3% of all 88 repeat CTs). Both online-adaptive strategies yielded V95%≥98% and better OAR sparing in 11/11 patients. Median OAR improvements up to 11%-point and 16%-point were observed when moving from robust planning to respectively restoration and full adaption.  Conclusion:   Both full plan adaptation and simple dose restoration can increase OAR sparing besides better conforming to the target criteria compared to robust treatment planning.""","""['Thyrza Z Jagt', 'Sebastiaan Breedveld', 'Rens van Haveren', 'Ben J M Heijmen', 'Mischa S Hoogeman']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Plan-library supported automated replanning for online-adaptive intensity-modulated proton therapy of cervical cancer.', 'Evaluation of alternative parameter settings for dose restoration and full plan adaptation in IMPT for prostate cancer.', 'Anatomical robust optimization to account for nasal cavity filling variation during intensity-modulated proton therapy: a comparison with conventional and adaptive planning strategies.', 'Robust radiotherapy planning.', 'Online adaptive planning methods for intensity-modulated radiotherapy.', 'Dosimetric advantages of daily adaptive strategy in IMPT for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Adaptive proton therapy.', 'Anatomic changes in head and neck intensity-modulated proton therapy: Comparison between robust optimization and online adaptation.']"""

Chemokines binding to their cognate receptors induce the migration of cancer cells, however, the molecular signalling pathways involved in this process are not fully understood. Protein kinase C (PKC) has been shown to regulate cell migration, adhesion and proliferation. In order to identify a connection between PKC and tumour progression in breast, prostate and leukaemia cells, the effect of PKC on CXCL8 or CXCL10-mediated cell migration and morphology was analysed. We tested the speed of the migrating cells, morphology, and chemotaxis incubated with different PKC isoforms inhibitors- GF109203X, staurosporine and PKCζ pseudosubstrate inhibitor (PKCζi). We found that the migration of CXCL8-driven PC3 and MDA-MB231 cells in the presence of conventional, novel or atypical PKCs was not affected, but atypical PKCζ is crucial for THP-1 chemotaxis. The speed of CXCL10-activated PC3 and MDA-MB231 cells was significantly reduced in the presence of conventional, novel and atypical PKCζ. THP-1 chemotaxis was again affected by atypical PKCζi. On the other hand, cell area, circularity or aspect ratio were affected by staurosporine in CXCL8 or CXCL10-activated cells, demonstrating a role of PKCα in the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton regardless of the effect on the migration. Consequently, this allows the speculation that different PKC isoforms induce different outcomes in migration and actin cytoskeleton based on the chemokine receptor and/or the cell type.""","""['Enana Alassaf', 'Anja Mueller']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur J Pharmacol""","""['A novel and selective inhibitor of PKC ζ potently inhibits human breast cancer metastasis in vitro and in mice.', 'Protein kinase C zeta is required for epidermal growth factor-induced chemotaxis of human breast cancer cells.', 'The role of PKC and PKD in CXCL12 directed prostate cancer migration.', 'Atypical protein kinase Cι as a human oncogene and therapeutic target.', 'The CXCL8-CXCR1/2 pathways in cancer.', 'Voltage-gated sodium channels: from roles and mechanisms in the metastatic cell behavior to clinical potential as therapeutic targets.', 'CD271 activation prevents low to high-risk progression of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and improves therapy outcomes.', 'Breast Cancer: Circular RNAs Mediating Efficacy in Preclinical In Vivo Models.', 'Osteoid cell-derived chemokines drive bone-metastatic prostate cancer.', 'The significance of spread through air spaces in the prognostic assessment model of stage I lung adenocarcinoma and the exploration of its invasion mechanism.']"""

The use of the da Vinci surgical system entails an additional aspect of noise in the OR. The SOTOS surgical team used wired or wireless headphone/microphone combinations to communicate. We measured sound pressure levels in two different locations in the OR and the heart rate of every surgical team member as an indicator of the stress level. We further captured subjective acceptance of SOTOS as well as perioperative data such as surgical time. We prospectively randomised 32 RALP patients into two study arms. Sixteen surgeries were performed using SOTOS and 16 without (control). Overall, the mean sound pressure level in the SOTOS group was 3.6 dB lower compared to the control (p < 0.001). The highest sound pressure level measured was 96 dB in the control group. Mean heart rates were 81.3 beats/min for surgeons and 90.8 beats/min for circulating nurses.

In many forms of cancer, when the disease is a solid tumor confined to one organ, it is often readily treated. However, when the cancer becomes an invasive metastatic carcinoma, it is more often fatal. It is therefore of great interest to identify mechanisms that contribute to the invasion of cells to identify possible targets for therapy. During prostate cancer progression, the epithelial cells undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition that is characterized by morphological changes, a loss of cell-cell adhesion, and invasiveness. Dysregulation of pH has emerged as a hallmark of cancer with a reversed pH gradient and with a constitutively increased intracellular pH that is elevated above the extracellular pH. This phenomenon has been referred to as ""a perfect storm"" for cancer progression. Acid-extruding ion transporters include the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE1 (SLC9A1), the Na+HCO3- cotransporter NBCn1 (SLC4A7), anion exchangers, vacuolar-type adenosine triphosphatases, and the lactate-H+ cotransporters of the monocarboxylate family (MCT1 and MCT4 (SLC16A1 and 3)). Additionally, carbonic anhydrases contribute to acid transport. Of these, several have been shown to be upregulated in different human cancers including the NBCn1, MCTs, and NHE1.

Results:   Median follow-up and surgical delay were 26 months (IQR 10-40) and 3 months (IQR 2-5), respectively.

At 90% sensitivity, PHID with cut-off value of 0.54 have demonstrated the highest sensitivity of 35.7% for overall PCa detection, so PHID and phi with cut-off values of 33.2 and 0.63 have demonstrated the specificity of 34.7% and 34.1% for ISUP grade ≥ 2 PCa detection at biopsy, respectively. In univariate ROC analysis, PHID with AUC of 0.77 and 0.80 was the most accurate predictor of overall and Epstein significant PCa, respectively, so phi with AUC of 0.77 was the most accurate predictor of ISUP grade ≥ 2 PCa at biopsy. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, phi improved diagnostic accuracy of multivariable models by 5% in predicting ISUP grade ≥ 2 PCa.  Conclusions:   PHID and phi have shown the greatest specificity at 90% sensitivity in predicting overall and clinically significant PCa and would lead to significantly avoid unnecessary biopsies. PHID is the most accurate predictor of overall and Epstein significant PCa, so phi is the most accurate predictor of ISUP grade ≥ 2 PCa. phi significantly improves the diagnostic accuracy of multivariable models in predicting ISUP grade ≥ 2 PCa.""","""['Marija Barisiene', 'Arnas Bakavicius', 'Diana Stanciute', 'Jolita Jurkeviciene', 'Arunas Zelvys', 'Albertas Ulys', 'Dalius Vitkus', 'Feliksas Jankevicius']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Biomed Res Int""","""['Evaluation of prostate-specific antigen isoform p2PSA and its derivates, %p2PSA, prostate health index and prostate dimension-adjusted related index in the detection of prostate cancer at first biopsy: an exploratory, prospective study.', 'Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) isoform p2PSA significantly improves the prediction of prostate cancer at initial extended prostate biopsies in patients with total PSA between 2.0 and 10 ng/ml: results of a prospective study in a clinical setting.', 'Serum isoform -2proPSA derivatives significantly improve prediction of prostate cancer at initial biopsy in a total PSA range of 2-10 ng/ml: a multicentric European study.', 'Clinical performance of serum -2proPSA derivatives, %p2PSA and PHI, in the detection and management of prostate cancer.', 'Clinical use of -2proPSA (p2PSA) and its derivatives (%p2PSA and Prostate Health Index) for the detection of prostate cancer: a review of the literature.', 'Value of serum free prostate-specific antigen density in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate health index (PHI) as an accurate prostate cancer predictor.', 'Nomograms Combining PHI and PI-RADS in Detecting Prostate Cancer: A Multicenter Prospective Study.', 'Molecular Biomarkers for the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'The Prostate Health Index and multi-parametric MRI improve diagnostic accuracy of detecting prostate cancer in Asian populations.']"""

The prostate cancer (PC) cells derived from different cancer metastasis sites show heterogeneity in mechanical response. This heterogeneity mediates two distinct metastasis patterns. High stiffness promotes individual cell migration and proliferation by inducing Yes-associated protein and tafazzin (YAP/TAZ) nuclear localization in bone metastasis-derived cells, whereas low stiffness promotes cell migration and proliferation by inducing lymphatic metastasis-derived cells to form clusters characterized by high expression of CD44.

Methods:   Network pharmacology databases including TCMSP, TCM-PTD, TCMID, and DrugBank were used to screen the active compounds and potential drug targets of JPFR. Cytoscape 3.7 software was applied to construct the interaction network between active compounds and potential targets. The DAVID online database analysis was performed to investigate the potential effective diseases and involved signaling pathways according to the results of the GO function and KEGG pathways enrichment analysis. To ensure standardization and maintain interbatch reliability of JPFR, High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was used to establish a ""chemical fingerprint."" For biological function validation, the effect of JPFR on the proliferation and migration of CRC cells in vitro was investigated by CCK-8 and transwell and wound healing assay, and the effect of JPFR on the growth and metastasis of CRC cells in vivo was detected by building a lung metastasis model in nude mice and in vivo imaging. For the potential mechanism validation, the expressions of MALAT1, PTBP-2, and β-catenin in CRC cells and transplanted CRC tumors were detected by real-time PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemical staining analysis.  Results:   According to the rules of oral bioavailability (OB) > 30% and drug-likeness (DL) > 0.18, 244 effective compounds in JPFR were screened out, as well as the corresponding 132 potential drug targets. By the analysis of DAVID database, all these key targets were associated closely with the cancer diseases such as prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, multiple signaling pathways were closely related to JPFR, including p53, Wnt, PI3K-Akt, IL-17, HIF-1, p38-MAPK, NF-κB, PD-L1 expression and PD-1 checkpoint pathway, VEGF, JAK-STAT, and Hippo. The systematical analysis showed that various active compounds of JPFR were closely connected with Wnt/β-catenin, EGFR, HIF-1, TGFβ/Smads, and IL6-STAT3 signaling pathway, including kaempferol, isorhamnetin, calycosin, quercetin, medicarpin, phaseol, spinasterol, hederagenin, beta-sitosterol, wighteone, luteolin, and isotrifoliol. For in vitro experiments, the migration and growth of human CRC cells were inhibited by the JPFR extract in a dose-dependent way, and the expression of MALAT1, PTBP-2, β-catenin, MMP7, c-Myc, and Cyclin D1 in CRC cells were downregulated by the JPFR extract in a dose-dependent way. For in vivo metastasis experiments, the numbers of lung metastasis were found to be decreased by the JPFR extract in a dose-dependent manner, and the expressions of metastasis-associated genes including MALAT1, PTBP-2, β-catenin, and MMP7 in the lung metastases were downregulated dose dependently by the JPFR extract. For the orthotopic transplanted tumor experiments, the JPFR extract could inhibit the growth of orthotopic transplanted tumors and downregulate the expression of c-Myc and Cyclin D1 in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the JPFR extract could prolong the survival time of tumor-bearing mice in a dose-dependent manner.  Conclusions:   Through effective network pharmacology analysis, we found that JPFR contains many effective compounds which may directly target cancer-associated signaling pathways. The in vitro and in vivo experiments further confirmed that JPFR could inhibit the growth and metastasis of CRC cells by regulating β-catenin signaling-associated genes or proteins.""","""['Xinyi Lu', 'Xingli Wu', 'Lin Jing', 'Lingjia Tao', 'Yingxuan Zhang', 'Renke Huang', 'Gong Zhang', 'Jianlin Ren']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Evid Based Complement Alternat Med""","""['JMJD2C promotes colorectal cancer metastasis via regulating histone methylation of MALAT1 promoter and enhancing β-catenin signaling pathway.', 'Combining Network Pharmacology and Experimental Validation to Study the Action and Mechanism of Water extract of Asparagus Against Colorectal Cancer.', 'Erianin, the main active ingredient of Dendrobium chrysotoxum Lindl, inhibits precancerous lesions of gastric cancer (PLGC) through suppression of the HRAS-PI3K-AKT signaling pathway as revealed by network pharmacology and in vitro experimental verification.', 'Exploration of the mechanism of Zisheng Shenqi decoction against gout arthritis using network pharmacology.', 'Traditional Chinese medicine for colorectal cancer treatment: potential targets and mechanisms of action.', 'Inhibition and potential treatment of colorectal cancer by natural compounds via various signaling pathways.', 'Exploring the mechanism of action of licorice in the treatment of COVID-19 through bioinformatics analysis and molecular dynamics simulation.', 'Study on the Mechanism of Diosgenin Targeting STAT3 to Inhibit Colon Cancer Proliferation and Migration.', 'Bioinformatics Analysis to Screen Key Targets of Curcumin against Colorectal Cancer and the Correlation with Tumor-Infiltrating Immune Cells.', 'Potential Molecular Target Prediction and Docking Verification of Hua-Feng-Dan in Stroke Based on Network Pharmacology.']"""

Methods:   Twenty-five patients of urinary system tumors were enrolled from May 2019 to September 2019, of whom, 21 patients had prostate cancer, and 4 had bladder cancer. Training of bladder filling started before CT simulation. The patients were required to take the individual bladder filling as the training goal, and the optimal bladder volume range was suggested to be 200－400 mL. After 2－4 weeks of training, the prescribed volume of the bladder was determined according to the patient's bladder receptivity. The volume of the bladder was measured by images of plain CT and images 8-minutes after intravenous contrast injection. The patient's bladder volume was measured using BladderScan before treatment. CBCT (Cone-beam CT) was performed, and bladder volume was measured before treatment. The bladder volume was measured again using BladderScan after treatment.  Results:   The mean bladder volume of simulation (VCT01) was (262±130) mL, ranging from 78 mL to 505 mL. The mean self-evaluation bladder volume before radiotherapy (VEVA01) was (238±107) mL, ranging from 100 mL to 400 mL.

Methods:   In the study, 53 patients with single positive core prostate biopsy and treated by radical prostatectomy from January 2010 to December 2018, were analyzed retrospectively. The mean age was (69.7±6.9) years (54-81 years), the mean prostate specific antigen (PSA) level was (9.70±5.24) μg/L (1.69-25.69 μg/L), and the mean prostate volume was (50.70±28.39) mL (12.41-171.92 mL). Thirty-nine out of 54 (73.6%) patients presented Gleason score with 6, 11 patients (20.8%) had Gleason score of 7 and 3 patients (5.7%) showed Gleason score ≥8. For clinical stages, 6 out of the 53 patients (11.3%) had prostate cancer in cT1, 44 cases (83.0%) had prostate cancer in cT2, and 3 cases (5.7%) in cT3.The patients were divided into subgroups according to age, preoperative PSA level, Gleason score, percentage of tumor in single needle tissue and clinical stage, and the differences of their clinicopathological characteristics were compared.  Results:   Postoperative Gleason score of 6, 7 and ≥8 were found in 20 cases (37.7%), 21 cases (39.6%) and 10 cases (18.9%) respectively, another 2 cases (3.8%) were pT0 prostate cancer; pathological stages of T0, T2a, T2b, T2c and T3 were found in 2 cases (3.8%), 9 cases (17.0%), 2 cases (3.8%), 29 cases (54.7%) and 11 cases (20.8%) respectively; 11 cases (20.8%) had positive surgical margin, 10 cases (18.9%) had extracapsular invasion of prostate, and 1 case (1.9%) showed seminal vesicle invasion. Forty-two cases (79.2%) had multifocal lesions and 37 cases (69.8%) presented bilateral lesion. Compared with the biopsy Gleason score, the postoperative Gleason score was downgrated in 3 cases (5.7%), unchanged in 28 cases (52.8%), and upgraded in 20 cases (37.7%), of which 2 cases (3.8%) were pT0. Compared with the clinical stage, the postoperative pathological stage decreased in 2 cases (3.8%), unchanged in 10 cases (18.9%), and upgraded in 41 cases (77.4%). According to the postoperative pathology, the patients were divided into two groups: microfocus cancer group (n=8) and non-microfocus cancer group (n=45). The difference between the two groups in the percentage of tumor in the single-needle tissue ≤5% was statistically significant (P=0.014). Other parameter diffe-rences including age, prostate volume, and preoperative prostate special antigen density (PSAD) and Gleason scores were not statistically significant (P>0.05). The method to determine the location of cancer at the apex of prostate according to biopsy results showed 41.4% (12/29) false negative rate and 50.0% (12/24) false positive rate. There was statistically significant difference between the actual cases of lymph node dissection and reserved nerve and the cases of scheme selection in theory according to the postoperative pathology (P < 0.05).  Conclusion:   The proportion of single needle cancer tissue less than or equal to 5% is a predictor of prostate microfocal cancer. 37.7% cases had pathological upgrading and 77.4% cases had pathological staging upgrading.

Methods:   Overall 14 patients with prostatic stromal tumor of uncertain malignant potential were treated from October 2008 to April 2020, the patient age ranged from 27 to 78 years (mean 54 years). The disease duration was 1 to 180 months (mean duration of 46 months). The clinical manifestations mainly included urinary obstructive symptoms and urethral irritating symptoms. The tumors were located in the peripheral zone or the transition zone. Digital rectum examination indicated prostatic tumor. Serum prostatic specific antigen level was always normal or elevated. Transrectal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging indicated prostatic tumor. Magnetic resonance imaging in showed large, round, well-defined masses, which were diffusely heterogeneous signal on T2 weighted imaging. Following the administration of intravenous contrast medium, the lesion had diffuse and heterogeneous enhancement.  Results:   In the study, 3 cases underwent prostate biopsy, 2 cases underwent transurethral resection of the prostate, 9 cases underwent radical excision or transurethral resection of the prostate with definite diagnosis of pathologic features. Under the light microscope, the interstitial cells of stromal tumor of uncertain malignant potential were overgrowth and fusiform cells showed some degree of pleomorphism, nuclei with few mitotic figures, and necrosis was not often seen. Immunohistochemical staining showed that prostate specific antigen was negative, while vimentin was positive in the tumor tissue, CD34, progesterone receptor and smooth muscle actin were positive in the majority, and Ki67 positive index was 1%-20% (mean 6%). Twelve cases were followed-up, and the time of survival varied from 10 to 96 months (mean 65 months), two cases were lost to the follow-up, one case died of disease at the end of 10 months, nine cases were free of disease recurrence after surgery, two cases underwent more transurethral resection of the prostate due to local recurrence.  Conclusion:   STUMP is a very rare tumor of the specialized prostatic stroma with an unpredictable clinical behavior. The clinical manifestations, transrectal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging are valuable for the diagnosis of prostatic stromal tumor of uncertain malignant potential. Its definite diagnosis depends on pathological examination.

Prostate-specific antigen testing followed by biopsy leads to overdetection, overtreatment as well as undertreatment of the disease. Evidence of treatment effectiveness has lacked because of the paucity of randomised controlled trials comparing conventional treatments.  Objectives:   To evaluate the effectiveness of conventional treatments for localised prostate cancer (active monitoring, radical prostatectomy and radical radiotherapy) in men aged 50-69 years.  Design:   A prospective, multicentre prostate-specific antigen testing programme followed by a randomised trial of treatment, with a comprehensive cohort follow-up.  Setting:   Prostate-specific antigen testing in primary care and treatment in nine urology departments in the UK.  Participants:   Between 2001 and 2009, 228,966 men aged 50-69 years received an invitation to attend an appointment for information about the Prostate testing for cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) study and a prostate-specific antigen test; 82,429 men were tested, 2664 were diagnosed with localised prostate cancer, 1643 agreed to randomisation to active monitoring (n = 545), radical prostatectomy (n = 553) or radical radiotherapy (n = 545) and 997 chose a treatment.  Interventions:   The interventions were active monitoring, radical prostatectomy and radical radiotherapy.  Trial primary outcome measure:   Definite or probable disease-specific mortality at the 10-year median follow-up in randomised participants.  Secondary outcome measures:   Overall mortality, metastases, disease progression, treatment complications, resource utilisation and patient-reported outcomes.  Results:   There were no statistically significant differences between the groups for 17 prostate cancer-specific (p = 0.48) and 169 all-cause (p = 0.87) deaths. Eight men died of prostate cancer in the active monitoring group (1.5 per 1000 person-years, 95% confidence interval 0.7 to 3.0); five died of prostate cancer in the radical prostatectomy group (0.9 per 1000 person-years, 95% confidence interval 0.4 to 2.2 per 1000 person years) and four died of prostate cancer in the radical radiotherapy group (0.7 per 1000 person-years, 95% confidence interval 0.3 to 2.0 per 1000 person years). More men developed metastases in the active monitoring group than in the radical prostatectomy and radical radiotherapy groups: active monitoring, n = 33 (6.3 per 1000 person-years, 95% confidence interval 4.5 to 8.8); radical prostatectomy, n = 13 (2.4 per 1000 person-years, 95% confidence interval 1.4 to 4.2 per 1000 person years); and radical radiotherapy, n = 16 (3.0 per 1000 person-years, 95% confidence interval 1.9 to 4.9 per 1000 person-years; p = 0.004). There were higher rates of disease progression in the active monitoring group than in the radical prostatectomy and radical radiotherapy groups: active monitoring (n = 112; 22.9 per 1000 person-years, 95% confidence interval 19.0 to 27.5 per 1000 person years); radical prostatectomy (n = 46; 8.9 per 1000 person-years, 95% confidence interval 6.7 to 11.9 per 1000 person-years); and radical radiotherapy (n = 46; 9.0 per 1000 person-years, 95% confidence interval 6.7 to 12.0 per 1000 person years; p < 0.001). Radical prostatectomy had the greatest impact on sexual function/urinary continence and remained worse than radical radiotherapy and active monitoring. Radical radiotherapy's impact on sexual function was greatest at 6 months, but recovered somewhat in the majority of participants. Sexual and urinary function gradually declined in the active monitoring group. Bowel function was worse with radical radiotherapy at 6 months, but it recovered with the exception of bloody stools. Urinary voiding and nocturia worsened in the radical radiotherapy group at 6 months but recovered. Condition-specific quality-of-life effects mirrored functional changes. No differences in anxiety/depression or generic or cancer-related quality of life were found. At the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence threshold of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year, the probabilities that each arm was the most cost-effective option were 58% (radical radiotherapy), 32% (active monitoring) and 10% (radical prostatectomy).  Limitations:   A single prostate-specific antigen test and transrectal ultrasound biopsies were used. There were very few non-white men in the trial. The majority of men had low- and intermediate-risk disease. Longer follow-up is needed.  Conclusions:   At a median follow-up point of 10 years, prostate cancer-specific mortality was low, irrespective of the assigned treatment. Radical prostatectomy and radical radiotherapy reduced disease progression and metastases, but with side effects. Further work is needed to follow up participants at a median of 15 years.

Methods:   We included 356 patients with a PI-RADS score 3 lesion at mpMRI who underwent prostate biopsy for a suspect of PCa at a single tertiary high-volume centre between 2013 and 2016.We developed Uni- (UVA) and multi variable (MVA) logistic regression analyses assessing the predictors of three endpoints: 1) diagnosis of PCa, 2) active surveillance (AS) criteria and 3) clinically significant (CS) PCa at final pathology.  Results:   PCa was diagnosed in 285 patients (80%), out of these 154 (56%) were eligible for AS according to Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance (PRIAS) criteria. Over the 228 (64%) patients who underwent surgery, 93 (40.8%) had a CS disease at final pathology. Hundred and ninety-three (84.6%) had a pT2 disease and 35 (15.4%) had a pT3 disease. The size of the main lesion, age, PSA and prostate volume efficiently predicted PCa at MVA (all p < 0.05). None of our predictors were significantly associated with AS characteristics. Over those patients who underwent surgery, the biopsy Gleason Score (p = 0.007) efficiently predicted a CS PCa at final pathology.  Conclusions:   mpMRI-detected PI-RADS 3 lesions should be sent to a prostate biopsy if other clinical parameters suggest the presence of a PCa.

Design and methods:   Longitudinal observations, comparing outcome measures before and after the implementation of Stockholm3.  Setting:   Stavanger region in Norway with about 370,000 inhabitants, 304 general practitioners (GPs) in 97 primary care clinics, and one hospital.  Intervention:   GPs were instructed to use Stockholm3 instead of PSA as standard procedure for diagnosis of prostate cancer.  Main outcome measures:   Proportion of GP clinics that had ordered a Stockholm3 test. Number of men referred to needle biopsy. Distribution of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPC) (Gleason Score ≥7) and clinically non-significant prostate cancer (cnsPC) (Gleason Score 6), in needle biopsies. Estimation of direct healthcare costs.  Results:   Stockholm3 was rapidly implemented as 91% (88/97) of the clinics started to use the test within 14 weeks. After including 4784 tested men, the percentage who would have been referred for prostate needle biopsy was 29.0% (1387/4784) if based on PSA level ≥3ng/ml, and 20.8% (995/4784) if based on Stockholm3 Risk Score (p < 0.000001). The proportion of positive biopsies with csPC increased from 42% (98/233) before to 65% (185/285) after the implementation. Correspondingly, the proportion of cnsPC decreased from 58% (135/233) before to 35% (100/285) after the implementation (p < 0.0017). Direct healthcare costs were estimated to be reduced by 23-28% per tested man.  Conclusion:   Replacing PSA with Stockholm3 for early detection of prostate cancer in primary care is feasible. Implementation of Stockholm3 resulted in reduced number of referrals for needle-biopsy and a higher proportion of clinically significant prostate cancer findings in performed biopsies. Direct healthcare costs decreased. KEY POINTS A change from PSA to Stockholm3 for the diagnosis of prostate cancer in primary care in the Stavanger region in Norway is described and assessed. •Implementation of a new blood-based test for prostate cancer detection in primary care was feasible. A majority of GP clinics started to use the test within three months. •Implementation of the Stockholm3 test was followed by: -a 28% reduction in number of men referred for urological prostate cancer work-up -an increase in the proportion of clinically significant cancer in performed prostate biopsies from 42 to 65% -an estimated reduction in direct health care costs between 23 and 28%.""","""['Eirik Viste', 'Cathrine Alvaer Vinje', 'Torgeir Gilje Lid', 'Svein Skeie', 'Øystein Evjen-Olsen', 'Tobias Nordström', 'Olav Thorsen', 'Bjørnar Gilje', 'Emiel A M Janssen', 'Svein R Kjosavik']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Scand J Prim Health Care""","""['Prostate cancer screening using a combination of risk-prediction, MRI, and targeted prostate biopsies (STHLM3-MRI): a prospective, population-based, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial.', 'The Stockholm3 blood-test predicts clinically-significant cancer on biopsy: independent validation in a multi-center community cohort.', 'Identifying Prostate Cancer Among Men with Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms.', 'The impact of reducing the prostate-specific antigen threshold and including isoform reflex tests on the performance characteristics of a prostate-cancer detection programme.', 'Centralisation of Care for Prevalent Urological Malignancies: The Case for Prostate Cancer.', ""Men's perception of information and psychological distress in the diagnostic phase of prostate cancer: a comparative mixed methods study."", 'Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Stockholm 3 Testing Compared to PSA as the Primary Blood Test in the Prostate Cancer Diagnostic Pathway: A Decision Tree Approach.', ""General practitioners' reflections on using PSA for diagnosis of prostate cancer.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the expression of IGF-1Ec in colorectal cancer and polyps compared to normal colon tissues and its association with recurrent disease using semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry.  Methods:   Immunohistochemistry for IGF-1Ec expression was performed for colorectal cancer, colorectal polyps and normal colonic tissues. The quantification of IGF-1Ec expression was performed with the use of Image J software and the IHC profiler plugin. Following ethics approval from the National Research Ethics Service (Reference 11/LO/1521), clinical information including recurrent disease on follow-up was collected for patients with colorectal cancer.  Results:   Immunohistochemistry was performed in 16 patients with colorectal cancer and 11 patients with colonic polyps and compared to normal colon tissues and prostate adenocarcinoma (positive control) tissues. Significantly increased expression of IGF-1Ec was demonstrated in colorectal cancer (p < 0.001) and colorectal polyps (p < 0.05) compared to normal colonic tissues. Colonic adenomas with high-grade dysplasia had significantly higher expression of IGF-1Ec compared to low-grade dysplastic adenomas (p < 0.001). Colorectal cancers without lymph node metastases at the time of presentation had significantly higher IGF-1Ec expression compared to lymph node-positive disease (p < 0.05). No correlation with recurrent disease was identified with IGF-1Ec expression.

Silencing the MAGE-A2 expression inhibited the proliferation of prostate cancer (PCa) cells and increased the chemosensitivity. However, the expression pattern of MAGE-A2 in PCa tissue samples and its prognostic and therapeutic values for PCa patients is still unclear.  Methods:   In this study, for the first time, the staining pattern and clinical significance of MAGE-A2 were evaluated in 166 paraffin-embedded prostate tissues, including 148 cases of PCa and 18 cases of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HPIN), by immunohistochemical analysis.  Results:   The simultaneous expression of both nuclear and cytoplasmic patterns of MAGE-A2 with different staining intensities was observed among studied cases. Increased expression of MAGE-A2 was significantly found in PCa tissues compared to HPIN cases (P < 0.0001). Among PCa samples, the strong staining intensity of nuclear expression was predominantly observed in comparison with cytoplasmic expression in PCa tissues (P < 0.0001). A significant and inverse correlation was found between the cytoplasmic expression of MAGE-A2 and increased Gleason score (P = 0.002). Increased cytoplasmic expression of MAGE-A2 was associated with longer biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCR-FS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of patients (P = 0.002, P = 0.001, respectively). In multivariate analysis, Gleason score and cytoplasmic expression of MAGE-A2 were independent predictors of the BCR-FS (P = 0.014; P = 0.028, respectively).

A DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model was used to calculate the summary relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). A total of 15 eligible cohort studies (16 data sets) with more than four million of participants were eventually included in this meta-analysis.

Vasectomy was also associated with the risk of advanced prostate cancer (RR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.02-1.13), which is less likely to be affected from detection bias. In conclusion, findings from this meta-analysis of prospective studies indicate that vasectomy may be positively associated with the risk of prostate cancer.

However, checkpoint blockade monotherapies have not been successful against most hematological malignancies including multiple myeloma and leukemia. There is an urgent need to identify new targets for development of cancer immunotherapy. LILRB1, an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif-containing receptor, is widely expressed on human immune cells, including B cells, monocytes and macrophages, dendritic cells and subsets of natural killer (NK) cells and T cells. The ligands of LILRB1, such as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, activate LILRB1 and transduce a suppressive signal, which inhibits the immune responses. However, it is not clear whether LILRB1 blockade can be effectively used for cancer treatment.  Methods:   First, we measured the LILRB1 expression on NK cells from cancer patients to determine whether LILRB1 upregulated on NK cells from patients with cancer, compared with NK cells from healthy donors. Then, we developed specific antagonistic anti-LILRB1 monoclonal antibodies and studied the effects of LILRB1 blockade on the antitumor immune function of NK cells, especially in multiple myeloma models, in vitro and in vivo xenograft model using non-obese diabetic (NOD)-SCID interleukin-2Rγ-null mice.  Results:   We demonstrate that percentage of LILRB1+ NK cells is significantly higher in patients with persistent multiple myeloma after treatment than that in healthy donors. Further, the percentage of LILRB1+ NK cells is also significantly higher in patients with late-stage prostate cancer than that in healthy donors. Significantly, we showed that LILRB1 blockade by our antagonistic LILRB1 antibody increased the tumoricidal activity of NK cells against several types of cancer cells, including multiple myeloma, leukemia, lymphoma and solid tumors, in vitro and in vivo.

For instance, fusing transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and magnetic resonance (MR) images to guide prostate cancer biopsy can significantly improve the diagnosis. However, multi-modal image registration is still challenging, even with the latest deep learning technology, as it requires large amounts of labeled transformations for network training. This paper aims to address this problem from two angles: (i) a new method of generating large amount of transformations following a targeted distribution to improve the network training and (ii) a coarse-to-fine multi-stage method to gradually map the distribution from source to target.

Methods:   This retrospective cohort study collected health records data for all cancer patients treated with external beam radiotherapy with curative intent in 2016 in Catalonia, Spain. Adherence was defined as having received at least 90% of the total dose prescribed. A logistic regression model was used to assess factors related to non-adherence, and its association with one-year survival was evaluated using Cox regression.

Treatment interruptions prolonged the total duration of therapy in 70.7% of the patients, and 1.0% were non-adherent. Non-adherence was associated with advanced age, female gender, and some localization of primary tumour (head and neck, urinary bladder, and haematological cancers). The risk of death in non-adherent patients was higher than in adherent patients (hazard ratio [HR] 1.63, 95% confidence interval 0.97-2.74), after adjusting for the potential confounding effect of age, gender, tumour site and comorbidity.

Materials and methods:   We reviewed our prospectively maintained database from January 2012 to July 2018. Logistic regression analyses were performed to test different clinical factors as predictors of clinically significant prostate cancer (CSPCa) and build nomograms. Calibration curves were used to assess the concordance between the predictive value and the true risk. Decision curves were created to measure the overall net benefit.  Results:   The prostate cancer (PCa) and CSPCa detection rates were 37.2% (81 of 218) and 23.9% (52 of 218) in the PI-RADS v2, score 3, cohort. More PCa cases (61.7%; 50 of 81) and CSPCa cases (75%; 39 of 52) were found in the peripheral zone than in the transitional zone. Multivariate analysis showed that age, prostate-specific antigen density, lesion region, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were predictive factors for CSPCa and PCa. Internally validated calibration curves showed that the predicted risk of CSPCa was closer to the actual probability when the threshold was > 60%. Decision curves showed that a better net benefit was achieved when the model was used to guide clinical practice.  Conclusions:   More cases of PCa and CSPCa were seen in the peripheral zone than in the transitional zone among patients with PI-RADS v2, score 3. The positive predictive value for a positive ADC (< 900 μm2/s) for the detection of CSPCa and PCa improved with an increasing prostate-specific antigen density.

We have previously identified several PIM substrates, which support cancer cell migration and invasiveness. However, none of them are known to regulate cellular movements by directly interacting with the actin cytoskeleton. Here we have studied the phosphorylation-dependent effects of PIM1 on actin capping proteins, which bind as heterodimers to the fast-growing actin filament ends and stabilize them.  Methods:   Based on a phosphoproteomics screen for novel PIM substrates, we have used kinase assays and fluorescence-based imaging techniques to validate actin capping proteins as PIM1 substrates and interaction partners. We have analysed the functional consequences of capping protein phosphorylation on cell migration and adhesion by using wound healing and real-time impedance-based assays. We have also investigated phosphorylation-dependent effects on actin polymerization by analysing the protective role of capping protein phosphomutants in actin disassembly assays.  Results:   We have identified capping proteins CAPZA1 and CAPZB2 as PIM1 substrates, and shown that phosphorylation of either of them leads to increased adhesion and migration of human prostate cancer cells. Phosphorylation also reduces the ability of the capping proteins to protect polymerized actin from disassembly.  Conclusions:   Our data suggest that PIM kinases are able to induce changes in actin dynamics to support cell adhesion and movement. Thus, we have identified a novel mechanism through which PIM kinases enhance motility and metastatic behaviour of cancer cells.

We evaluated changes in GSE and analyzed the relationship between GSE and prostate cancer-specific and general health-related QOL.  Methods:   We conducted a longitudinal survey with 104 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy and administered the General Self-efficacy Scale (GSES), Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC), and SF8 Health Survey (SF-8).

Our goal was to characterize PSA screening trends in the Veterans Health Administration (VA) before and after the USPSTF recommendation and to determine if PSA screening was more likely to be ordered based on a veteran's race or age.  Methods:   Using the VA Corporate Data Warehouse, we created 10 annual groups of PSA-eligible men covering 2009-2018. We identified all PSA tests performed in the VA to determine yearly rates of PSA screening. All statistical tests were 2-sided.  Results:   The overall rate of PSA testing in the VA decreased from 63.3% in 2009 to 51.2% in 2018 (P < .001). PSA screening rates varied markedly by age group during our study period, with men aged 70-80 years having the highest initial rate and greatest decline (70.6% in 2009 to 48.4% in 2018, P < .001). Men aged 55-69 years had a smaller decline (65.2% in 2009 to 58.9% in 2018, P < .001) whereas the youngest men, aged 40-54 years, had an increase in PSA screening (26.2% in 2009 to 37.8% in 2018, P < .001).  Conclusions:   In this analysis of PSA screening rates among veterans before and after the 2012 USPSTF recommendation against screening, we found that overall PSA screening decreased only modestly, continuing for more than one-half of the men in our study.

Up to date, minimal research has been conducted regarding the application of machine learning with emphasis on modern efficient convolutional neural networks (CNNs) algorithms, for the diagnosis of prostate cancer metastasis from bone scintigraphy images. The advantageous and outstanding capabilities of deep learning, machine learning's groundbreaking technological advancement, have not yet been fully investigated regarding their application in computer-aided diagnosis systems in the field of medical image analysis, such as the problem of bone metastasis classification in whole-body scans. In particular, CNNs are gaining great attention due to their ability to recognize complex visual patterns, in the same way as human perception operates. Considering all these new enhancements in the field of deep learning, a set of simpler, faster and more accurate CNN architectures, designed for classification of metastatic prostate cancer in bones, is explored. This research study has a two-fold goal: to create and also demonstrate a set of simple but robust CNN models for automatic classification of whole-body scans in two categories, malignant (bone metastasis) or healthy, using solely the scans at the input level. Through a meticulous exploration of CNN hyper-parameter selection and fine-tuning, the best architecture is selected with respect to classification accuracy. Thus a CNN model with improved classification capabilities for bone metastasis diagnosis is produced, using bone scans from prostate cancer patients. The achieved classification testing accuracy is 97.38%, whereas the average sensitivity is approximately 95.8%. Finally, the best-performing CNN method is compared to other popular and well-known CNN architectures used for medical imaging, like VGG16, ResNet50, GoogleNet and MobileNet. The classification results show that the proposed CNN-based approach outperforms the popular CNN methods in nuclear medicine for metastatic prostate cancer diagnosis in bones.""","""['Nikolaos Papandrianos', 'Elpiniki Papageorgiou', 'Athanasios Anagnostis', 'Konstantinos Papageorgiou']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Development of Convolutional Neural Networks to identify bone metastasis for prostate cancer patients in bone scintigraphy.', 'Efficient Bone Metastasis Diagnosis in Bone Scintigraphy Using a Fast Convolutional Neural Network Architecture.', 'White blood cells detection and classification based on regional convolutional neural networks.', 'Bone scan index: A new biomarker of bone metastasis in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Convolutional neural networks for computer-aided detection or diagnosis in medical image analysis: An overview.', 'Differentiation of Bone Metastasis in Elderly Patients With Lung Adenocarcinoma Using Multiple Machine Learning Algorithms.', 'Systematic Review of Tumor Segmentation Strategies for Bone Metastases.', 'Semi-supervised segmentation of metastasis lesions in bone scan images.', 'Emerging Applications of Deep Learning in Bone Tumors: Current Advances and Challenges.', 'Convolutional neural networks for detection of transthyretin amyloidosis in 2D scintigraphy images.']"""

Pathologists are in critical need of accurate biomarkers to characterize PC, particularly to confirm the presence of intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDC-P), an aggressive histopathological variant for which therapeutic options are now available. Our aim was to identify IDC-P with Raman micro-spectroscopy (RμS) and machine learning technology following a protocol suitable for routine clinical histopathology laboratories.  Methods and findings:   We used RμS to differentiate IDC-P from PC, as well as PC and IDC-P from benign tissue on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded first-line radical prostatectomy specimens (embedded in tissue microarrays [TMAs]) from 483 patients treated in 3 Canadian institutions between 1993 and 2013. The main measures were the presence or absence of IDC-P and of PC, regardless of the clinical outcomes. The median age at radical prostatectomy was 62 years. Most of the specimens from the first cohort (Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal) were of Gleason score 3 + 3 = 6 (51%) while most of the specimens from the 2 other cohorts (University Health Network and Centre hospitalier universitaire de Québec-Université Laval) were of Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 (51% and 52%, respectively). Most of the 483 patients were pT2 stage (44%-69%), and pT3a (22%-49%) was more frequent than pT3b (9%-12%). To investigate the prostate tissue of each patient, 2 consecutive sections of each TMA block were cut. The first section was transferred onto a glass slide to perform immunohistochemistry with H&E counterstaining for cell identification. The second section was placed on an aluminum slide, dewaxed, and then used to acquire an average of 7 Raman spectra per specimen (between 4 and 24 Raman spectra, 4 acquisitions/TMA core). Raman spectra of each cell type were then analyzed to retrieve tissue-specific molecular information and to generate classification models using machine learning technology. Models were trained and cross-validated using data from 1 institution. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 87% ± 5%, 86% ± 6%, and 89% ± 8%, respectively, to differentiate PC from benign tissue, and 95% ± 2%, 96% ± 4%, and 94% ± 2%, respectively, to differentiate IDC-P from PC. The trained models were then tested on Raman spectra from 2 independent institutions, reaching accuracies, sensitivities, and specificities of 84% and 86%, 84% and 87%, and 81% and 82%, respectively, to diagnose PC, and of 85% and 91%, 85% and 88%, and 86% and 93%, respectively, for the identification of IDC-P. IDC-P could further be differentiated from high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), a pre-malignant intraductal proliferation that can be mistaken as IDC-P, with accuracies, sensitivities, and specificities > 95% in both training and testing cohorts. As we used stringent criteria to diagnose IDC-P, the main limitation of our study is the exclusion of borderline, difficult-to-classify lesions from our datasets.  Conclusions:   In this study, we developed classification models for the analysis of RμS data to differentiate IDC-P, PC, and benign tissue, including HGPIN. RμS could be a next-generation histopathological technique used to reinforce the identification of high-risk PC patients and lead to more precise diagnosis of IDC-P.""","""['Andrée-Anne Grosset', 'Frédérick Dallaire', 'Tien Nguyen', 'Mirela Birlea', 'Jahg Wong', 'François Daoust', 'Noémi Roy', 'André Kougioumoutzakis', 'Feryel Azzi', 'Kelly Aubertin', 'Samuel Kadoury', 'Mathieu Latour', 'Roula Albadine', 'Susan Prendeville', 'Paul Boutros', 'Michael Fraser', 'Rob G Bristow', 'Theodorus van der Kwast', 'Michèle Orain', 'Hervé Brisson', 'Nazim Benzerdjeb', 'Hélène Hovington', 'Alain Bergeron', 'Yves Fradet', 'Bernard Têtu', 'Fred Saad', 'Frédéric Leblond', 'Dominique Trudel']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS Med""","""['Dimensional reduction based on peak fitting of Raman micro spectroscopy data improves detection of prostate cancer in tissue specimens.', 'Prostate Biopsy Specimens With Gleason 3+3=6 and Intraductal Carcinoma: Radical Prostatectomy Findings and Clinical Outcomes.', 'Atypical Intraductal Cribriform Proliferations of the Prostate Exhibit Similar Molecular and Clinicopathologic Characteristics as Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate.', 'Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate without High-Grade Invasive Adenocarcinoma: Report of Two Cases and Review of the Literature.', 'Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate.', 'In situ Raman spectroscopy and machine learning unveil biomolecular alterations in invasive breast cancer.', 'High-throughput analysis of tissue microarrays using automated desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.', 'Image-guided Raman spectroscopy navigation system to improve transperineal prostate cancer detection.

Here, we found that the transcription factor EGR3, located at chromosome 8p21.3, is a critical metastasis suppressor. Aberrant deletion of EGR3 was found in up to 59.76% (deep deletions, 16.87%; shallow deletions, 42.89%) of prostate cancer patients. In informatics analysis, EGR3 loss was associated with prostate cancer progression and low survival rates. EGR3 expression inversely correlated with the expressions of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis-related gene sets in prostate cancer tissues. In prostate cancer cells, EGR3 blocked the EMT process and suppressed cell migration and invasion. In a mouse model for cancer metastasis, EGR3 overexpression significantly suppressed bone metastases of PC3 and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells. Mechanistically, EGR3 transcriptionally activated ZFP36, GADD45B, and SOCS3 genes by directly binding to their promoter regions. The EMT-inhibitory and tumor-suppressive roles of the EGR3 downstream genes were identified through in vitro and in silico analyses.

However, attempts to develop anti-chaperone drugs targeting molecules such as Hsp70 have been hampered by toxicity issues. Hsp70 is regulated by a suite of co-chaperone molecules that bring ""clients"" to the primary chaperone for efficient folding. Rather than targeting Hsp70 itself, here we have examined the feasibility of inhibiting the Hsp70 co-chaperone DNAJA1 as a novel anticancer strategy. We found DNAJA1 to be upregulated in a variety of cancers, suggesting a role in malignancy. To confirm this role, we screened the NIH Approved Oncology collection for chemical-genetic interactions with loss of DNAJA1 in cancer. 41 compounds showed strong synergy with DNAJA1 loss, whereas 18 dramatically lost potency. Several hits were validated using a DNAJA1 inhibitor (116-9e) in castration-resistant prostate cancer cell (CRPC) and spheroid models. Taken together, these results confirm that DNAJA1 is a hub for anticancer drug resistance and that DNAJA1 inhibition is a potent strategy to sensitize cancer cells to current and future therapeutics. The large change in drug efficacy linked to DNAJA1 suggests a personalized medicine approach where tumor DNAJA1 status may be used to optimize therapeutic strategy.""","""['Nitika', 'Jacob S Blackman', 'Laura E Knighton', 'Jade E Takakuwa', 'Stuart K Calderwood', 'Andrew W Truman']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Targeting the Hsp40/Hsp70 Chaperone Axis as a Novel Strategy to Treat Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Dealing with difficult clients via personalized chaperone inhibitors.', 'Synthetic Small Molecule Modulators of Hsp70 and Hsp40 Chaperones as Promising Anticancer Agents.', 'DnaJA1 antagonizes constitutive Hsp70-mediated stabilization of tau.', 'Heat shock proteins 27, 40, and 70 as combinational and dual therapeutic cancer targets.', 'Large-Scale Databases and Portals on Cancer Genome to Analyze Chaperone Genes Correlated to Patient Prognosis.', 'HSP70 and their co-chaperones in the human malaria parasite P. falciparum and their potential as drug targets.', 'The APE2 Exonuclease Is a Client of the Hsp70-Hsp90 Axis in Yeast and Mammalian Cells.', 'DNAJA1 Stabilizes EF1A1 to Promote Cell Proliferation and Metastasis of Liver Cancer Mediated by miR-205-5p.', 'The C-terminal domain of Hsp70 is responsible for paralog-specific regulation of ribonucleotide reductase.']"""

However, its pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated, accounting for poor overall survival. Circular RNA (circRNA) is a class of noncoding RNAs discovered many years ago. Only recently have they been re-evaluated for their important roles in the regulation of gene expression. Studies have confirmed that circRNAs have important biological functions in a variety of malignant tumors. This study aimed to characterize one circRNA derived from the MBOAT2 gene and termed it circMBOAT2, which has been reported to promote prostate cancer progression. CircMBOAT2 is highly expressed in both CRC tissues and serum samples, and has a correlation with tumor stage. The receiver-operating characteristic curves suggested that circMBOAT2 acted as a novel diagnostic tumor marker in CRC. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the levels of circMBOAT2 in tissues were independent prognostic markers of CRC. Further functional studies revealed that circMBOAT2 served as a microRNA (miRNA) sponge of miR-519d-3p and promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC cells. Also, circMBOAT2 regulated cell proliferation and migration by competitively binding to miR-519d-3p and targeting troponin-associated protein (TROAP) in CRC cells.

Nonetheless, the effect of these drugs is often time-limited and eventually most patients become resistant due to various AR alterations. Although liquid biopsy approaches are powerful tools for early detection of such therapy resistances, most assays investigate only a single resistance mechanism. In combination with the typically low abundance of circulating biomarkers, liquid biopsy assays are therefore informative only in a subset of patients. In this pilot study, we aimed to increase overall sensitivity for tumor-related information by combining three liquid biopsy approaches into a multi-analyte approach. In a cohort of 19 CRPC patients, we (1) enumerated and characterized circulating tumor cells (CTCs) by mRNA-based in situ padlock probe analysis, (2) used RT-qPCR to detect cancer-associated transcripts (e.g., AR and AR-splice variant 7) in lysed whole blood, and (3) conducted shallow whole-genome plasma sequencing to detect AR amplification. Although 44-53% of patient samples were informative for each assay, a combination of all three approaches led to improved diagnostic sensitivity, providing tumor-related information in 89% of patients. Additionally, distinct resistance mechanisms co-occurred in two patients, further reinforcing the implementation of multi-analyte liquid biopsy approaches.""","""['Lilli Hofmann', 'Katja Sallinger', 'Christoph Haudum', 'Maria Smolle', 'Ellen Heitzer', 'Tina Moser', 'Michael Novy', 'Kevin Gesson', 'Thomas Kroneis', 'Thomas Bauernhofer', 'Amin El-Heliebi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancers (Basel)""","""['Detection of AR-V7 in Liquid Biopsies of Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients: A Comparison of AR-V7 Analysis in Circulating Tumor Cells, Circulating Tumor RNA and Exosomes.', 'Expression pattern of androgen receptors, AR-V7 and AR-567es, in circulating tumor cells and paired plasma-derived extracellular vesicles in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Comprehensive Profiling of the Androgen Receptor in Liquid Biopsies from Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Reveals Novel Intra-AR Structural Variation and Splice Variant Expression Patterns.', 'AR-v7 liquid biopsy for treatment stratification in prostate cancer: how close are we?', 'ARV-7: A biomarker for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Biomarkers for the Detection and Risk Stratification of Aggressive Prostate Cancer.', 'Hydroxymethylation profile of cell-free DNA is a biomarker for early colorectal cancer.', 'A Systematic Review of Circulating Tumor Cells Clinical Application in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Combinatorial Power of cfDNA, CTCs and EVs in Oncology.', 'Systemic Effects Reflected in Specific Biomarker Patterns Are Instrumental for the Paradigm Change in Prostate Cancer Management: A Strategic Paper.']"""

Patients and methods:   From 30 June 2017 to 9 August 2019, patients with post-radical prostatectomy prostate cancer who underwent F-18 fluciclovine PET/CT and had PSA level within 2-week interval (PSAPET) ≤0.5 ng/mL were enrolled into this single-institution retrospective study. Data on tumor characteristics, including Gleason scores, extra-prostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion, surgical margin and nodal metastasis, PSA after radical prostatectomy, previous hormonal therapy, PSA doubling time (PSADT), scanner type, PSAPET and site of recurrence were collected. Comparison of these factors between groups of positive and negative fluciclovine PET/CT was done by using Mann-Whitney U-test and Fisher's exact test.  Results:   Of 94 eligible patients with post-radical prostatectomy prostate cancer, 10 patients had positive studies (10.6%).

However, 68Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-PET/computed tomography (CT) has proven to be an excellent tracer for detection of skeletal metastases. The aim of this study was to assess if adding skeletal imaging (with 18F-Fluoride-PET/CT) to 68-Ga-PSMA-PET/CT had any impact on high-risk PCa staging.  Method:   Fifty treatment-naive, histopathologically proven, high-risk (European Association of Urology) PCa patients underwent both 68-Ga-PSMA-PET/CT and 18F-Fluoride-PET/CT for staging.  Results:   Fluoride-PET/CT detected significantly a higher number of skeletal metastases/patient than PSMA-PET/CT (median 4.5/patient vs 3.0; Wilcoxan-signed-rank-test, P = 0.060) and there was a significantly higher proportion of only Fluoride-avid than only PSMA-avid lesions (McNemar-test P < 0.001). No significant advantage was seen in patient-wise metrics. Most lesions missed by PSMA-PET/CT were in flat bones (25/33). serum prostate specific antigen (S.PSA) showed positive correlation with both, the number of lesions [r(PSMA)-0.555 (P = 0.006) and r(Fluoride)-0.622 (P = 0.001)] as well as tumor to background ratio (TBR) [[r-0.706 (P < 0.001) and 0.516 (P = 0.010)]. Median TBR was significantly higher in PSMA-PET/CT (22.77 vs 16.30; P < 0.001). All three patients with only Fluoride-avid lesions (also not identified in bone-scan) showed biochemical response with additional therapy.  Conclusion:   Though, Fluoride-PET/CT detected a higher absolute number of lesions than PSMA-PET/CT, no significant advantage was seen in patient-wise metrics. Fluoride-PET/CT added second-line management in only 3/50 patients, which could have been reduced to 1/50, with more sensitive evaluation of flat bones in PSMA-PET-CT.

We found that nearly half of GBM cell lines, patient-derived xenografts (PDX), and human tumors expressed AR at the transcript and protein level-with expression levels overlapping those of primary prostate cancer. Analysis of gene expression datasets also revealed that AR expression is higher in GBM patient samples than normal brain tissue. Multiple clinical-grade antiandrogens slowed the growth of and radiosensitized AR-positive GBM cell lines and PDXs in vitro and in vivo Antiandrogens blocked the ability of AR-positive GBM PDXs to engage adaptive transcriptional programs following radiation and slowed the repair of radiation-induced DNA damage.

However, it is very challenging especially when one image was acquired with the use of endorectal coil (ERC) but the other was not, which causes significant deformation. Classical iterative image registration methods are also computationally intensive. Deep learning based registration frameworks have recently been developed and demonstrated promising performance. However, the lack of proper constraints often results in unrealistic registration. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning based registration network with anatomical constraint to address these issues. The proposed approach uses a cycle constraint loss to achieve forward/backward registration and an inverse constraint loss to encourage diffeomorphic registration. In addition, an adaptive anatomical constraint aiming for regularizing the registration network with the use of anatomical labels is introduced through weak supervision. Our experiments on registering prostate MR images of the same subject obtained at different time points with and without ERC show that the proposed method achieves very promising performance under different measures in dealing with the large deformation. Compared with other existing methods, our approach works more efficiently with average running time less than a second and is able to obtain more visually realistic results.""","""['Bo Du', 'Jiandong Liao', 'Baris Turkbey', 'Pingkun Yan']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""IEEE J Biomed Health Inform""","""['Narrow band deformable registration of prostate magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging, and computed tomography studies.', 'Label-driven magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) registration using weakly supervised learning for MRI-guided prostate radiotherapy.', 'Expandable and rigid endorectal coils for prostate MRI: impact on prostate distortion and rigid image registration.', 'Learning-based deformable registration for infant MRI by integrating random forest with auto-context model.', 'MR to ultrasound image registration with segmentation-based learning for HDR prostate brachytherapy.', 'Dual attention network for unsupervised medical image registration based on VoxelMorph.', 'Functional magnetic resonance imaging progressive deformable registration based on a cascaded convolutional neural network.']"""

The aim of this manuscript was to analyze the association between cancer incidence and socioeconomic position (SEP) in a middle-income country (Costa Rica) between 2011 and 2015.  Methods:   An ecological study at the level of the electoral district was conducted. The 477 districts were divided by area and wealth using the 2011 Census. The sample was defined using the National Electoral Rolls used for presidential elections of 2006 and 2010 (N = 2 798 517). 44 799 cancer cases were included coming from the Costa Rican Cancer Registry. Cox models were used.  Results:   All cancer sites combined, we observed a positive gradient, with incidence being lower in the poorest districts than in the wealthiest (HRQ2 = 0.98 [0.93-1.03], HRQ3 = 0.92 [0.85-0.99], HRQ4 = 0.83 [0.77-0.88]). For colon, skin, breast, prostate, thyroid and other cancer sites, a positive social gradient was observed. For stomach, lung, and cervical (invasive or in-situ) cancers, a negative social gradient was found. For uterine cancer and lymphoma (no-Hodgkin), there was no significant relationship between wealth and incidence. For skin cancer, incidence was higher in rural as compared to urban areas after adjustment for wealth. For lung, cervical and uterine cancer, incidence was lower in rural as compared to urban area after adjustment for wealth.

For optimal performance, they require the fragment ion spectra of targeted peptides as prior knowledge. In this report, we describe a MS pipeline and spectral resource to support targeted proteomics studies for human tissue samples. To build the spectral resource, we integrated common open-source MS computational tools to assemble a freely accessible computational workflow based on Docker. We then applied the workflow to generate DPHL, a comprehensive DIA pan-human library, from 1096 data-dependent acquisition (DDA) MS raw files for 16 types of cancer samples. This extensive spectral resource was then applied to a proteomic study of 17 prostate cancer (PCa) patients. Thereafter, PRM validation was applied to a larger study of 57 PCa patients and the differential expression of three proteins in prostate tumor was validated. As a second application, the DPHL spectral resource was applied to a study consisting of plasma samples from 19 diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients and 18 healthy control subjects. Differentially expressed proteins between DLBCL patients and healthy control subjects were detected by DIA-MS and confirmed by PRM.

The patient was a 73-year-old woman with a polypoid lesion sized 3 × 2 cm located at the interface between the bladder neck and the proximal urethra. Transurethral resection was performed and small tissue fragments with positive margins were obtained. Histology revealed an epithelial neoplasm consisting of cribriform structures located in the subepithelial connective tissue of the bladder wall and proximal urethra. The lesion showed positive immunohistochemical staining with prostate specific antigen, prostatic acid phosphatase, NKX3.1, and alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase. Using the Illumina TruSight Tumor 170 next-generation sequencing assay, a mutation and loss of heterozygosity of the phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) gene was detected. No fusion in any of the examined genes was found using this assay as well as FusionPlex Solid Tumor Kit and FusionPlex Sarcoma kit assays from ArcherDX. Given the rarity of Skene's gland adenocarcinoma, it is uncertain whether the same grading and prognostic criteria that are currently used for prostatic cancer apply here as well. It is also unclear what treatment strategy should be applied, but according to the available literature, it seems that local excision or wide surgical resection could represent sufficient therapeutic modalities.""","""['Jiří Lenz', 'Michal Michal', 'Michael Michal', 'Ondřej Hes', 'Petra Konečná', 'David Lenz']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Surg Pathol""","""[""Skene's Glands Adenocarcinoma: A Series of 4 Cases."", ""Skene's gland adenocarcinoma with intestinal differentiation: A case report and literature review."", ""Skene's gland adenocarcinoma with increased serum level of prostate-specific antigen."", ""Prostate specific antigen and prostate specific acid phosphatase in adenocarcinoma of Skene's paraurethral glands and ducts."", ""Skene's Gland Malignancy: A Case Report and Systematic Review."", ""Adenosquamous Carcinoma of Skene's Gland: A Case Report and Literature Review.""]"""

In a recent study, we have introduced a facile protocol for the preparation of corrole-protein nanoparticles (NPs). These NPs consist of a corrole-core coated with protein. We now report that a novel lipophilic corrole, (2)Ga, delivered as human serum albumin (HSA)-coated NPs, displayed antineoplastic activity towards human prostate cancer DU-145 cells. Cryo-TEM analysis of these NPs revealed an average diameter of 50.2 ± 8.1 nm with a spherical architecture exhibiting low polydispersity. In vitro cellular uptake of (2)Ga/albumin NPs was attributable to rapid internalization of the corrole through ligand binding-dependent extracellular release and intercalation of the corrole cargo into the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane. This finding is in contrast with a previously reported study on corrole-protein NPs that displayed cellular uptake via endocytosis. Investigation of the non-light-induced mechanism of action of (2)Ga suggested the induction of necrosis through plasma membrane destabilization, impairment of calcium homeostasis, lysosomal stress and rupture, as well as formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). (2)Ga also exhibited potent light-induced cytotoxicity through ROS generation.

Methods:   All men with prostate cancer (PCa) who received RP in the second hospital of Tianjin Medical University from 2014 to 2018 were retrospectively identified. All patients met the following criteria: no neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment, absence of lymph node invasion, or distant metastasis confirmed by surgery or imaging. Comparisons were made between cases with only apex positive (AM), isolated nonapical positive (OM), multiple positive (MM), and negative surgical margins (NSM). Patients were also subdivided according to the Gleason score and pathological tumor stage for analysis.  Results:   A total of 416 patients available for analysis, of which 132 (31.7%) were PSM, 43 were AM, 37 were OM, and 52 were MM at a median follow-up of 27 months. The PNI was in 30.5% of patients. BCR occurred in 22.6% of patients during follow-up. Both AM and MM were noticed to be independent predictors of BCR with a hazard ratio of 4.192 (95% CI 2.185-8.042; p < 0.001) and 2.758 (95% CI 1.559-4.880; p < 0.001), respectively, when compared to NSM. Though the correlation was significant in univariate analysis, PNI was not an independent risk factor for BCR (p = 0.369).

In human prostate cell lines, ETV4 promotes migration, invasion, and proliferation; however, its role in PC has been unclear. In this study, we have explored the effects of ETV4 expression in the prostate in a novel transgenic mouse model.  Methods:   We have created a mouse model with prostate-specific expression of ETV4 (ETV4 mice). By histochemical and molecular analysis, we have investigated in these engineered mice the expression of p21, p27, and p53. The implications of our in vivo findings have been further investigated in human cells lines by chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase assays.  Results:   ETV4 mice, from two independent transgenic lines, have increased cell proliferation in their prostate and two-thirds of them, by the age of 10 months, developed mouse prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN). In these mice, cdkn1a and its p21 protein product were reduced compared to controls; p27 protein was also reduced. By ChIP assay in human prostate cell lines, we show that ETV4 binds to a specific site (-704/-696 bp upstream of the transcription start) in the CDKN1A promoter that was proven, by luciferase assay, to be functionally competent. ETV4 further controls CDKN1A expression by downregulating p53 protein: this reduction of p53 was confirmed in vivo in ETV4 mice.  Conclusions:   ETV4 overexpression results in the development of mPIN but not in progression to cancer. ETV4 increases prostate cell proliferation through multiple mechanisms, including downregulation of CDKN1A and its p21 protein product: this in turn is mediated through direct binding of ETV4 to the CDKN1A promoter and through the ETV4-mediated decrease of p53. This multi-faceted role of ETV4 in prostate cancer makes it a potential target for novel therapeutic approaches that could be explored in this ETV4 transgenic model.""","""['Irene Cosi', 'Annamaria Pellecchia', 'Emanuele De Lorenzo', 'Eugenio Torre', 'Michela Sica', 'Gabriella Nesi', 'Rosario Notaro', 'Maria De Angioletti']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Hematol Oncol""","""['ERRgamma suppresses cell proliferation and tumor growth of androgen-sensitive and androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cells and its implication as a therapeutic target for prostate cancer.', 'ETV4 mediates dosage-dependent prostate tumor initiation and cooperates with p53 loss to generate prostate cancer.', 'Suppression of CHK1 by ETS Family Members Promotes DNA Damage Response Bypass and Tumorigenesis.', 'Advances in mouse models of prostate cancer.', 'Glioma pathogenesis-related protein 1: tumor-suppressor activities and therapeutic potential.', 'ETV4 facilitates proliferation, migration, and invasion of liver cancer by mediating TGF-β signal transduction through activation of B3GNT3.', 'Prognostic Values of Gene Copy Number Alterations in Prostate Cancer.', 'Identification and characterization of novel ETV4 splice variants in prostate cancer.', 'Knockdown of ETV4 promotes autophagy-dependent apoptosis in GBM cells by reducing the transcriptional activation of EMP1.', 'ETV4 promotes breast cancer cell stemness by activating glycolysis and CXCR4-mediated sonic Hedgehog signaling.']"""

Methods:   Eligible HNC and BC patients were randomized 1:1 to receive Xonrid® + SOC or SOC during RT. Patients were instructed to apply Xonrid® on the irradiated area three times daily, starting on the first day of RT and until 2 weeks after RT completion or until the development of grade ≥ 3 skin toxicity. The primary endpoint was to evaluate the proportion of patients who developed an ARD grade < 2 at the 5th week in both groups. Secondary endpoints were median time to grade 2 (G2) skin toxicity onset; changes in skin erythema and pigmentation and trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL); patient-reported skin symptoms. All patients were evaluated at baseline, weekly during RT and 2 weeks after treatment completion. The evaluation included: clinical toxicity assessment; reflectance spectrometry (RS) and TEWL examination; measurement of patients' quality of life (QoL) through Skindex-16 questionnaire.  Results:   Eighty patients (40 for each cancer site) were enrolled between June 2017 and July 2018. Groups were well balanced for population characteristics. All BC patients underwent 3-Dimensional Conformal RT (3D-CRT) whereas HNC patients underwent Volumetric-Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT). At week 5 the proportion of BC patients who did not exhibit G2 ARD was higher in Xonrid® + SOC group (p = 0.091). In the same group the onset time of G2 ARD was significantly longer than in SOC-alone group (p < 0.0491). For HNC groups there was a similar trend, but it did not reach statistical significance. For both cancer sites, patients' QoL, measured by the Skindex-16 score, was always lower in the Xonrid® + SOC group.  Conclusion:   Despite the failure to achieve the primary endpoint, this study suggests that Xonrid® may represent a valid medical device in the prevention and treatment of ARD at least in BC patients, delaying time to develop skin toxicity and reducing the proportion of patients who experienced G2 ARD during RT treatment and 2 weeks later.

Therefore, this proof-of-concept study was performed to compare protein expression profiles of patients with radio-recurrent PCA to patients treated with primary radical prostatectomy separated by Gleason risk groups. We hypothesized that radio-recurrent PCA have a similar protein expression as high-risk Gleason PCA.  Methods:   Patient cohorts consisted of (i) 31 patients treated with salvage prostatectomy for locally recurrent PCA after primary radiotherapy and (ii) 94 patients treated with primary prostatectomy split into a Gleason high-risk (≥4 + 3; n = 42 [44.7%]) versus a low-risk group (≤3 + 4; n = 52 [55.3%]). Immunohistochemistry was performed using 15 antibodies with known association to radioresistance in PCA in vitro. ELISA was used for validation of selected markers in serum.  Results:   Androgen receptor (AR) was overexpressed in most radio-recurrent PCA (89.7%) and in most primary high-risk Gleason PCA (87.8%; p = 0.851), while only 67.3% of the low-risk group showed an expression (p = 0.017). Considering the highest Gleason pattern in primary PCA, aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3 (AKR1C3) was most similarly expressed by patients with radio-recurrent PCA and patients with Gleason patterns 4 and 5 (p = 0.827 and p = 0.893) compared to Gleason pattern 3 (p = 0.20). These findings were supported by ELISA.  Conclusion:   This is the first study to evaluate protein markers in order to predict radioresistance in PCA. Our results point to AR and AKR1C3 as the most promising markers that might help stratify patients for radiotherapy.""","""['Tim Nestler', 'Maike Wittersheim', 'Stephan Schaefer', 'Martin Hellmich', 'David Pfister', 'Margarete Odenthal', 'Melanie von Brandenstein', 'Reinhard Buettner', 'Axel Heidenreich']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Urol Int""","""['Expression of androgen receptor through androgen-converting enzymes is associated with biological aggressiveness in prostate cancer.', 'Transition from androgenic to neurosteroidal action of 5α-androstane-3α, 17β-diol through the type A γ-aminobutyric acid receptor in prostate cancer progression.', 'Early upregulation of AR and steroidogenesis enzyme expression after 3 months of androgen-deprivation therapy.', 'Epigenetic mechanisms underlying prostate cancer radioresistance.', 'Drivers of Radioresistance in Prostate Cancer.']"""

In this study, we investigated the correlation between diverse clinical factors and bone metastasis in PCa patients and identified potential biomarkers of bone metastasis in PCa patients.  Methods:   The clinical data of 150 PCa patients were reviewed consecutively from January 2015 to March 2020 in this study. The relationships between clinical characteristics, serum biomarkers and bone metastasis in PCa patients were analyzed, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to identify potential markers of bone metastasis in prostate cancer. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to explore the diagnostic values of potential biomarkers.  Results:   Compared with the PCa patients without bone metastasis, the serum levels of CA-125, T-PSA, F-PSA, CYFRA21-1 and ProGRP were significantly elevated in PCa patients with bone metastasis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that T-PSA (OR 1.014, P = 0.021), F-PSA (OR 1.124, P = 0.016) and Pro-gastrin-releasing peptide (ProGRP) (OR 1.057, P = 0.026) were significantly associated with the bone metastasis of PCa patients. ROC curves indicated that T-PSA, F-PSA and ProGRP could effectively discriminate bone metastasis from non-bone metastasis PCa patients, and the AUCs (area under the curves) were 0.885, 0.919 and 0.752, respectively. According to the Youden index, the cut-off values of T-PSA, F-PSA and ProGRP were defined as 56.50 ng/ml, 6.96 ng/ml and 31.60 pg/ml, respectively. T-PSA, F-PSA and ProGRP produced a sensitivity of 78.30%, 81.70% and 61.70%, a specificity of 93.30%, 88.90% and 82.20%, respectively. The AUC for the combination of T-PSA, F-PSA with ProGRP was 0.941 with 90.00% sensitivity, much better than that of any single biomarker or two biomarkers combinate.

In line with the Precision Medicine Initiative that suggests clinical and socioenvironmental factors can impact PCa outcomes, we determined whether nSES variables are associated with time to PCa diagnosis and could inform PCa clinical risk assessment.  Materials and methods:   The study sample included 358 high risk men (PCa family history and/or Black race), aged 35-69 years, enrolled in an early detection program. Patient variables were linked to 78 nSES variables (employment, income, etc.) from previous literature via geocoding. Patient-level models, including baseline age, prostate specific antigen (PSA), digital rectal exam, as well as combined models (patient plus nSES variables) by race/PCa family history subgroups were built after variable reduction methods using Cox regression and LASSO machine-learning. Model fit of patient and combined models (AIC) were compared; p-values<0.05 were significant. Model-based high/low nSES exposure scores were calculated and the 5-year predicted probability of PCa was plotted against PSA by high/low neighborhood score to preliminarily assess clinical relevance.  Results:   In combined models, nSES variables were significantly associated with time to PCa diagnosis. Workers mode of transportation and low income were significant in White men with a PCa family history. Homeownership (%owner-occupied houses with >3 bedrooms) and unemployment were significant in Black men with and without a PCa family history, respectively. The 5-year predicted probability of PCa was higher in men with a high neighborhood score (weighted combination of significant nSES variables) compared to a low score (e.g., Baseline PSA level of 4ng/mL for men with PCa family history: White-26.7% vs 7.7%; Black-56.2% vs 29.7%).

Several studies have revealed that the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5 plays a role in tumour progression and development of drug resistance such as enzalutamide. Data mining revealed heterogeneous expression of STAT5 in enzalutamide-treated mCRPC patients and enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer (PCa). Isobologram analysis revealed that the STAT5 inhibitor pimozide combined with enzalutamide has? additive and synergistic inhibitory effects on cell viability in the used models. Functional analysis with siRNA-mediated STAT5 knockdown yielded divergent results. The LNCaP-derived cell line MR49F could be resensitised to enzalutamide by siRNA-mediated STAT5b-knock-down. In contrast, neither STAT5a nor STAT5b knockdown resensitised enzalutamide-resistant LAPC4-EnzaR cells to enzalutamide. In conclusion, our results indicate that STAT5 may be a possible target in a subgroup of enzalutamide-resistant PCa.

The development of additional tumour-antigen binding monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) will help expand the range of immunotherapeutic targets. Lewis histo-blood group and related glycans are overexpressed on many carcinomas, including those of the colon, lung, breast, prostate and ovary, and can therefore be selectively targeted by mAbs. Here we examine the molecular and structural basis for recognition of extended Lea and Lex containing glycans by a chimeric mAb. Both the murine (FG88.2) IgG3 and a chimeric (ch88.2) IgG1 mAb variants showed reactivity to colorectal cancer cells leading to significantly reduced cell viability. We determined the X-ray structure of the unliganded ch88.2 fragment antigen-binding (Fab) containing two Fabs in the unit cell. A combination of molecular docking, glycan grafting and molecular dynamics simulations predicts two distinct subsites for recognition of Lea and Lex trisaccharides. While light chain residues were exclusively used for Lea binding, recognition of Lex involved both light and heavy chain residues. An extended groove is predicted to accommodate the Lea-Lex hexasaccharide with adjoining subsites for each trisaccharide.

Objective:   This paper presents an augmented reality system to be used with benchtop models commonly available in medical schools with the aim of addressing the problem of lack of visualization. The system enables visualization of the examining finger, as well as of the internal organs when performing digital rectal examinations. Magnetic tracking sensors are used to track the movement of the finger, and a pressure sensor is used to monitor the applied pressure. By overlaying a virtual finger on the real finger and a virtual model on the benchtop model, students can see through the examination and finger maneuvers.  Methods:   The system was implemented in the Unity game engine (Unity Technologies) and uses a first-generation HoloLens (Microsoft Inc) as an augmented reality device. To evaluate the system, 19 participants (9 clinicians who routinely performed digital rectal examinations and 10 medical students) were asked to use the system and answer 12 questions regarding the usefulness of the system.  Results:   The system showed the movement of an examining finger in real time with a frame rate of 60 fps on the HoloLens and accurately aligned the virtual and real models with a mean error of 3.9 mm. Users found the movement of the finger was realistic (mean 3.9, SD 1.2); moreover, they found the visualization of the finger and internal organs were useful for teaching, learning, and assessment of digital rectal examinations (finger: mean 4.1, SD 1.1; organs: mean 4.6, SD 0.8), mainly targeting a novice group.  Conclusions:   The proposed augmented reality system was designed to improve teaching and learning of digital rectal examination skills by providing visualization of the finger and internal organs.

In recent years, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been proven to participate in the development of different cancers, including NSCLC. PCGEM1 prostate-specific transcript (PCGEM1) is the lncRNA which is associated with the progression of several cancers. Nevertheless, in NSCLC, the specific functions of PCGEM1 are not yet clear.  Methods:   The real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was utilized to test the expression of PCGEM1 in NSCLC cells. Functional experiments, including cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay, flow cytometry analysis and transwell assays were utilized to estimate cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis. Meanwhile, RNA pull down assay and luciferase reporter assay were utilized to evaluate the correlation of miR-433-3p with PCGEM1 or WT1 associated protein (WTAP).  Result:   PCGEM1 was highly expressed in NSCLC cells, while miR-433-3p was lowly expressed in NSCLC cells. PCGEM1 silencing or miR-433-3p overexpression inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion but accelerated cell apoptosis. MiR-433-3p was proven be sponged by PCGEM1. Besides, WTAP was the target of miR-433-3p and it accelerated the progression of NSCLC. In the end, rescue experiments indicated that overexpression of WTAP or knockdown of miR-433-3p reversed the inhibited roles of silencing PCGEM1 on cell behavior.

The purpose of our study was to compare health-related quality of life at 3 years between prostate cancer patients and healthy controls according to key life-style characteristics. Secondary objectives were to compare urological dysfunction, sexual function, anxiety and depression.  Methods:   Multicentric, case-control, observational prospective, open, follow-up study including 819 prostate cancer patients < 75 years old from the EPICAP cohort, newly diagnosed from 1 December 2011 to 31 March 2014 and 879 healthy controls. Participants were excluded if they experienced a relapse. Controls from the same geographical region were age-matched and were excluded if they were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Patients received one of the following treatments: active surveillance (AS), radical prostatectomy (RP), external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), High-intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU), chemotherapy (CT), or androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) as appropriate. The primary outcome was the quality of life as evaluated by the QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Scores were analyzed by multivariate analysis to adjust for predefined socio-demographic confounding effects.  Results:   In total, 564 participants were included (mean age 67.9 years): 376 patients and 188 controls. Treatment breakdown was: 258 underwent RP, 90 received EBRT, 52 brachytherapy or HIFU, 15 CT, 26 ADT and 61 AS. There was no difference in median global quality of life between patients and controls (94.87 vs 94.15, p = 0.71). Multivariate analysis showed poorer social functioning in patients (24.3% vs. 16.3%, p = 0.0209), more dyspnea (22% vs. 12.4%, p = 0.0078), and yet less current pain (23% vs 33%, p = 0.0151).  Conclusions:   Global health status score at 3 years after diagnosis was similar between patients and controls, though patients showed a significantly worse social functioning. Prostate cancer diagnosis per se does not seem to impact the quality of life of patients < 75 years at diagnosis. However, the therapeutic option that will be chosen following diagnosis should be carefully discussed with the medical staff in terms of benefit-risk ratios as it could have a long-term impact on urinary or erectile dysfunction.

Bland-Altman plots of ROI size and CBR in ablation sites showed good agreement between T2*W (TE = 32, 63 ms) and sceT1W images, with ROI sizes on T2*W (TE = 63 ms) strongly correlated (r = 0.64, p = 0.013) and within 15% of those in sceT1W images.  Conclusions:   In detected ablation zone ROI size and CBR, non-contrast-enhanced T2*W MRI is comparable to contrast-enhanced T1W MRI, presenting as a potential method for intra-procedural monitoring of FLA for PCa.  Key points:   • T2*-weighted MR images with long TE visualize post-procedure focal laser ablation zone comparably to the contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI. • T2*-weighted MRI could be used as a plausible method for repeated intra-operative monitoring of thermal ablation zone in prostate cancer, avoiding potential toxicity due to heating of contrast agent.""","""['Chongpeng Sun', 'Shiyang Wang', 'Aritrick Chatterjee', 'Milica Medved', 'Scott Eggener', 'Gregory S Karczmar', 'Aytekin Oto']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Evaluation of Focal Laser Ablation of Prostate Cancer Using High Spectral and Spatial Resolution Imaging: A Pilot Study.', 'Evaluation of tumor coverage after MR-guided prostate focal laser ablation therapy.', 'Comparison of T2-Weighted Imaging, DWI, and Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI for Calculation of Prostate Cancer Index Lesion Volume: Correlation With Whole-Mount Pathology.', 'Evaluation of Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging Versus Standard Diffusion Imaging for Detection and Grading of Peripheral Zone Prostate Cancer.', 'MRI-guided focal laser ablation for prostate cancer followed by radical prostatectomy: correlation of treatment effects with imaging.', 'Real-Time MRI-Guided Prostate Interventions.']"""

The potential of miRNA in gene therapy and diagnostic applications is well documented. To further improve miRNAs' ability to distinguish between PCa and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients, nine miRNA (-21, -27b, -93, -141, -205, -221, -182, -375 and let-7a) with the highest reported differentiation power were chosen and for the first time used in comparative studies of serum and prostate tissue samples. Spearman correlations and response operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were applied to assess the capability of the miRNAs present in serum to discriminate between PCa and BPH patients. The present study clearly demonstrates that miR-93 and miR-375 could be taken into consideration as single blood-based non-invasive molecules to distinguish PCa from BPH patients. We indicate that these two miRNAs have six common, PCa-related, target genes (CCND2, MAP3K2, MXI1, PAFAH1B1, YOD1, ZFYVE26) that share the molecular function of protein binding (GO:0005515 term).

In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of the anti-cancer effects of astaxanthin on prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines using aggressive PCa DU145 cells. Also an instantaneous silenced cell line (si-STAT3) derived from DU145 and a control cell line (si-NK) were used for the MTT and colony formation assays to determine the role of astaxanthin in proliferation and colony formation abilities. Flow cytometry assays were used to detect the apoptosis of tumor cells. Migration and invasion assays detected the weakening of the respective abilities. Western blot and RT-PCR tests detected the levels of STAT3 protein and mRNA. Astaxanthin resulted in suppression of the proliferation of DU145 cells and the level of STAT3. The treatment of DU145 cells with astaxanthin decreased the cloning ability, increased the apoptosis percentage and weakened the abilities of migration and invasion of the cells. Furthermore, astaxanthin reduced the expression of STAT3 at protein and mRNA levels. The effects were enhanced when astaxanthin and si-STAT3 were combined. The results of animal experiments were consistent with the results in cells.

However, due to the low sensitivity of TRUS to cancerous tissue in the prostate, small yet clinically significant tumors can be missed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with TRUS fusion biopsy has recently been introduced as a way to improve the identification of clinically significant PCa in men. However, the spatial errors in coregistering the preprocedural MRI with the real-time TRUS causes false negatives. A real-time and intraprocedural imaging modality that can sensitively detect PCa tumors and, more importantly, differentiate aggressive from nonaggressive tumors could largely improve the guidance of biopsy sampling to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient risk stratification. In this work, we seek to fill this long-standing gap in clinical diagnosis of PCa via the development of a dual-modality imaging device that integrates the emerging photoacoustic imaging (PAI) technique with the established TRUS for improved guidance of PCa needle biopsy. Unlike previously published studies on the integration of TRUS with PAI capabilities, this work introduces a novel approach for integrating a focused light delivery mechanism with a clinical-grade commercial TRUS probe, while assuring much-needed ease of operation in the transrectal space. We further present the clinical potential of our device by (i) performing rigorous characterization studies, (ii) examining the acoustic and optical safety parameters for human prostate imaging, and (iii) demonstrating the structural and functional imaging capabilities using deep-tissue-mimicking phantoms. Our TRUSPA experimental studies demonstrated a field-of-view in the range of 130 to 150 degrees and spatial resolutions in the range of 300 μm to 400 μm at a soft tissue imaging depth of 5 cm.""","""['Sumit Agrawal', 'Kerrick Johnstonbaugh', 'Joseph Y Clark', 'Jay D Raman', 'Xueding Wang', 'Sri-Rajasekhar Kothapalli']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Diagnostics (Basel)""","""['Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment in Biopsy-naïve Patients: The Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator in Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS) Fusion Biopsy and Systematic TRUS Biopsy.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-targeted, 3D transrectal ultrasound-guided fusion biopsy for prostate cancer: Quantifying the impact of needle delivery error on diagnosis.', 'Risk-based Patient Selection for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Prostate Biopsy after Negative Transrectal Ultrasound-guided Random Biopsy Avoids Unnecessary Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scans.', 'Comparing Three Different Techniques for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Prostate Biopsies: A Systematic Review of In-bore versus Magnetic Resonance Imaging-transrectal Ultrasound fusion versus Cognitive Registration.

A wide range of risk assessments and classifications are available. However, each one has significant limitations to distinguish between indolent and aggressive prostate cancers. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) may provide an alternate additional source, beyond tissue biopsies, to enable individual patient-specific clinical assessment, simply because CTCs can reveal both tumor-derived and germline-specific genetic information more precisely than that gained from a single diagnostic biopsy. In this study, we combined a filtration-based CTC isolation technology with prostate cancer CTC immunophenotyping to identify prostate cancer CTCs. Next, we performed 3-D telomere profiling prior to laser microdissection and single-cell whole-exome sequencing (WES) of 21 CTCs and 4 lymphocytes derived from 10 localized high-risk prostate cancer patient samples. Localized high-risk prostate cancer patient CTCs present a high number of telomere signals with lower signal intensities (short telomeres). To capture the genetic diversity/heterogeneity of high-risk prostate cancer CTCs, we carried out whole-exome sequencing. We identified 202,241 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 137,407 insertion-deletions (indels), where less than 10% of these genetic variations were within coding regions. The genetic variation (SNVs + indels) and copy number alteration (CNAs) profiles were highly heterogeneous and intra-patient CTC variation was observed. The pathway enrichment analysis showed the presence of genetic variation in nine telomere maintenance pathways (patients 3, 5, 6, and 7), including an important gene for telomere maintenance called telomeric repeat-binding factor 2 (TRF2). Using the PharmGKB database, we identified nine genetic variations associated with response to docetaxel. A total of 48 SNVs can affect drug response for 24 known cancer drugs. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (patients 1, 3, 6, and 8) identified the presence of CNAs in 11 different pathways, including the DNA damage repair (DDR) pathway. In conclusion, single-cell approaches (WES and 3-D telomere profiling) showed to be useful in unmasking CTC heterogeneity. DDR pathway mutations have been well-established as a target pathway for cancer therapy. However, the frequent CNA amplifications found in localized high-risk patients may play critical roles in the therapeutic resistance in prostate cancer.""","""['Aline Rangel-Pozzo', 'Songyan Liu', 'Gabriel Wajnberg', 'Xuemei Wang', 'Rodney J Ouellette', 'Geoffrey G Hicks', 'Darrel Drachenberg', 'Sabine Mai']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cells""","""['A comparison of isolated circulating tumor cells and tissue biopsies using whole-genome sequencing in prostate cancer.', 'An Accessible and Unique Insight into Metastasis Mutational Content Through Whole-exome Sequencing of Circulating Tumor Cells in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Discordant and heterogeneous clinically relevant genomic alterations in circulating tumor cells vs plasma DNA from men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Detection of circulating tumor cells from peripheral blood in prostate cancer.', 'Development and Application of Liquid Biopsies in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Circulating tumour cells for early detection of clinically relevant cancer.', 'Single-Circulating Tumor Cell Whole Genome Amplification to Unravel Cancer Heterogeneity and Actionable Biomarkers.', 'Identification of epithelial and mesenchymal circulating tumor cells in clonal lineage of an aggressive prostate cancer case.', 'Recent advances and application of whole genome amplification in molecular diagnosis and medicine.', 'A pipeline for copy number profiling of single circulating tumour cells to assess intrapatient tumour heterogeneity.']"""

Methods:   The costs of delivering prostate cancer radiotherapy with MR-IGRT and CT-IGRT in conventional 39 fractions and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) 5 fractions schedules were determined using literature values and cost accounting from two institutions. Gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity rates associated with CT-IGRT were summarized from 20 studies. Toxicity-related costs and utilities were obtained from literature values and cost databases. Markov modeling was used to determine the savings per patient for every 1% relative reduction in acute and chronic toxicities by MR-IGRT over 15 years. The costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) saved with toxicity reduction were juxtaposed with the cost increase of MR-IGRT to determine toxicity reduction thresholds for cost-effectiveness. One way sensitivity analyses were performed. Standard $100,000 and $50,000 per QALY ratios were used.  Results:   The added cost of MR-IGRT was $1,459 per course of SBRT and $10,129 per course of conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. Relative toxicity reductions of 7 and 14% are required for SBRT to be cost-effective using $100,000 and $50,000 per QALY, respectively. Conventional radiotherapy requires relative toxicity reductions of 50 and 94% to be cost-effective.  Conclusion:   From a healthcare perspective, MR-IGRT can reasonably be expected to be cost-effective. Hypofractionated schedules, such a five fraction SBRT, are most likely to be cost-effective as they require only slight reductions in toxicity (7-14%).  Advances in knowledge:   This is the first detailed economic assessment of MR-IGRT, and it suggests that MR-IGRT can be cost-effective for prostate cancer treatment through toxicity reduction alone.""","""['Leif-Erik D Schumacher', 'Alan Dal Pra', 'Sarah E Hoffe', 'Eric A Mellon']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Br J Radiol""","""['Magnetic resonance imaging-guided stereotactic body radiotherapy for prostate cancer (mirage): a phase iii randomized trial.', 'Cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and MR-guided targeted biopsy versus systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy in diagnosing prostate cancer: a modelling study from a health care perspective.', 'Acute toxicity of image-guided hypofractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: nonrandomized comparison with conventional fractionation.', 'Systematic review of the cost effectiveness of radiation therapy for prostate cancer from 2003 to 2013.', 'MRI-guided prostate adaptive radiotherapy - A systematic review.', 'Adaptive radiotherapy for breast cancer.', 'Economic Evaluations of Magnetic Resonance Image-Guided Radiotherapy (MRIgRT): A Systematic Review.', 'The Economic Burden of Localized Prostate Cancer and Insights Derived from Cost-Effectiveness Studies of the Different Treatments.', 'Integrated MRI-guided radiotherapy - opportunities and challenges.', 'Assessment of MRI-Linac Economics under the RO-APM.']"""

However, the variation in segmentation of prostate cancer among users and potential inaccuracy has not been studied.  Methods:   Four consultant radiologists, four consultant urologists, four urology trainees, and four nonclinician segmentation scientists were asked to segment a single slice of a lateral T3 prostate tumor on MRI (""Prostate 1""), an anterior zone prostate tumor MRI (""Prostate 2""), and a kidney tumor computed tomography (CT) scan (""Kidney""). Time taken and self-rated subjective accuracy out of a maximum score of 10 were recorded. Root mean square error, Dice coefficient, Matthews correlation coefficient, Jaccard index, specificity, and sensitivity were calculated using the radiologists as the ground truth.  Results:   There was high variance among the radiologists in segmentation of Prostate 1 and 2 tumors with mean Dice coefficients of 0.81 and 0.58, respectively, compared to 0.96 for the kidney tumor. Urologists and urology trainees had similar accuracy, while nonclinicians had the lowest accuracy scores for Prostate 1 and 2 tumors (0.60 and 0.47) but similar for kidney tumor (0.95). Mean sensitivity in Prostate 1 (0.63) and Prostate 2 (0.61) was lower than specificity (0.92 and 0.93) suggesting under-segmentation of tumors in the non-radiologist groups. Participants spent less time on the kidney tumor segmentation and self-rated accuracy was higher than both prostate tumors.  Conclusion:   Segmentation of prostate cancers is more difficult than other anatomy such as kidney tumors. Less experienced participants appear to under-segment models and underestimate the size of prostate tumors. Segmentation of prostate cancer is highly variable even among radiologists, and 3D modeling for clinical use must be performed with caution.

Methods and materials:   In this retrospective analysis, all patients treated by RE between 2007 and 2018 (n = 907) were screened for the following setting/conditions: sequential RE of left and right liver lobe in two sessions, liver-specific MRI (MRI1) acquired max. 10 days before or after first RE (RE1), liver-specific MRI (MRI2) acquired with a minimum time interval of 20 days after MRI1, but before second RE (RE2). No systemic tumor therapies between MRI1 and MRI2. No patients with liver cirrhosis. Metastases > 5 mm in untreated liver lobes were compared in MRI1 and MRI2 and rated as follows: same size or larger in MRI2 = no abscopal effect (NAE); > 30% shrinkage without Y-90 contamination in SPECT/CT = abscopal effect (AE).  Results:   Ninety six of 907 patients met aforementioned criteria. Median time-frame between RE1 and MRI2 was 34 (20-64) days.

Recently, we validated Rubidium-82 (82Rb) positron emission tomography (PET) for TBF measurement in prostate cancer (PCa) and found TBF and cancer aggressiveness positively correlated. The aims of the present study were to determine the ability of TBF for separating significant from insignificant PCa and to examine the relation to underlying Na+/K+-ATPase density, which is relevant as 82Rb is transported intracellularly via the Na+/K+-ATPase.  Methods:   One hundred and two patients were included for pelvic 82Rb PET scan prior to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided prostate biopsy. Findings constituted 100 PCa lesions (86 patients) and 25 benign lesions (16 patients). Tumours were defined on MRI and transferred to 82Rb PET for TBF measurement. Immunohistochemical Na+/K+-ATPase staining was subsequently performed on biopsies.  Results:   TBF was the superior predictor (rho = 0.68, p < 0.0001, inflammatory lesions excluded) of MRI-guided biopsy grade group (GG) over lowest apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value (rho = -0.23, p = 0.01), independent of ADC value and tumour volume (p < 0.0001). PET could separate GG-2-5 from GG-1 and benign lesions with an area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity of 0.79, 96%, and 59%, respectively. For separating GG-3-5 from GG-1-2 and benign lesions the AUC, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.82, 95%, and 63%, respectively. Na+/K+-ATPase density per PCa cell profile was 38% lower compared with that of the benign prostate cell profiles. Neither cell density nor Na+/K+-ATPase density determined tumour 82Rb uptake.  Conclusion:   TBF is an independent predictor of PCa aggressiveness and deserves more attention, as it may be valuable in separating clinically significant from insignificant PCa.""","""['Mads Ryø Jochumsen', 'Jens Sörensen', 'Bodil Ginnerup Pedersen', 'Jens Randel Nyengaard', 'Søren Rasmus Palmelund Krag', 'Jørgen Frøkiær', 'Michael Borre', 'Kirsten Bouchelouche', 'Lars Poulsen Tolbod']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Potential synergy between PSMA uptake and tumour blood flow for prediction of human prostate cancer aggressiveness.', 'Quantitative Tumor Perfusion Imaging with 82Rb PET/CT in Prostate Cancer: Analytic and Clinical Validation.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Repeatability of tumor blood flow quantification with 82Rubidium PET/CT in prostate cancer\xa0-\xa0a test-retest study.', 'Recent Advances in Cardiovascular Diseases Research Using Animal Models and PET Radioisotope Tracers.', 'Extracardiac findings with increased perfusion during clinical O-15-H2O PET/CT myocardial perfusion imaging: A case series.', 'Non-invasive radionuclide imaging of trace metal trafficking in health and disease: ""PET metallomics"".', 'DCE-MRI of Brain Fluid Barriers: In Vivo Water Cycling at the Human Choroid Plexus.', 'Potential synergy between PSMA uptake and tumour blood flow for prediction of human prostate cancer aggressiveness.']"""

Results:   Consensus reads were false positive in 20 regions of 17/217 (8%) patients with lesion validation. Majority of the false positive interpretations (13 of 20, 65%) occurred in the context of suspected prostate (bed) relapse (T) after radiotherapy (n = 11); other false positive findings were noted for prostate bed post prostatectomy (T, n = 2), pelvic nodes (N, n = 2), or extra pelvic lesions (M, n = 5). Major sources of false positive findings were PSMA-expressing residual adenocarcinoma with marked post-radiotherapy treatment effect. False negative interpretation occurred in 8 regions of 6/79 (8%) patients with histopathology validation, including prostate (bed) (n = 5), pelvic nodes (n = 1), and extra pelvic lesions (n = 2).

Overall, the standard deviation of systematic (Σ) and random (σ) setup error was lower with gold marker matching than with bone matching (3D displacement = 1.8 and 1.1 mm vs 2.1 and 1.6 mm, respectively). With gold marker matching, the setup error of the position of the prostate centroid was smaller, and the optimal setup margin was lower than that with bone matching (2Σ + 0.7σ and 2.5Σ + 0.7σ of 3D displacement = 4.3 and 5.2 mm vs 5.3 and 6.4 mm, respectively).

Deeper prostate-specific antigen (PSA) suppression is prognostic for outcome. However, the concordance of PSA rise and radiographic progression has not been examined previously in mHSPC, whereas this has been reported in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.  Objective:   To determine the patterns of progression by PSA and radiographic parameters in patients in ECOG3805.  Design, setting, and participants:   We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients in ECOG3805. Patients were classified according to the PSA level at progression (whether PSA level was below 2.0 ng/mL or not) and the type of progression event in the study (either PSA progression as defined by the study with or without clinical progression, or clinical progression alone). Baseline demographics, clinical outcomes, and patterns of progression were compared between the groups.  Results and limitations:   One in eight patients had clinical progression below a PSA level of 2 ng/mL, and approximately 25% developed clinical progression in the absence of confirmed PSA progression. Overall survival from randomization was shorter in patients with clinical progression without confirmed PSA progression than in patients with PSA progression alone as the first progression. Patient demographics at study entry were not predictive of the pattern of progression. Study limitations include its retrospective and post hoc nature.  Conclusions:   Clinical progression prior to PSA rise or at low PSA levels is a relatively frequent phenomenon in mHSPC and is associated with poorer overall survival. Further biological and clinical studies of these patients are warranted.  Patient summary:   Reliance on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) alone is an inadequate strategy to monitor patients undergoing treatment for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. Prostate cancer can get worse on scans even with low PSA and/or no or small changes in PSA. Imaging should be added to PSA testing to monitor patients with metastatic prostate cancer.""","""['Alan H Bryce', 'Yu Hui Chen', 'Glenn Liu', 'Michael A Carducci', 'David M Jarrard', 'Jorge A Garcia', 'Robert Dreicer', 'Maha Hussain', 'Mario Alfredo Eisenberger', 'Elizabeth R Plimack', 'Nicholas J Vogelzang', 'Robert S DiPaola', 'Lauren Harshman', 'Christopher J Sweeney']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['Opening a Scan of Worms.', 'Seven-Month Prostate-Specific Antigen Is Prognostic in Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer Treated With Androgen Deprivation With or Without Docetaxel.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Results:   Tumour variants in ctDNA were positively identified pre-treatment in two of eight patients, which in both cases remained detectable postoperatively. Patients with tumour variants in ctDNA had extremely rapid disease recurrence and progression compared to those where variants could not be detected. In terms of aberrations targeted, single nucleotide and structural variants outperformed indels and copy number aberrations.

LNCaP prostate cancer cells (PSMA+), HCT-116 and CaCo-2 colon cancer cells (PSMA-), as well as human peripheral monocytes and lymphocytes (PSMA-), were in vitro exposed to fluorescent CNT composites. The interaction/adherence of those composites to target cells was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, showing a diffuse interaction of CNTs and CNT-PTX with all cell types.

Participants and methods:   A cohort of 602 patients treated with transurethral resection of bladder tumour and histopathologically diagnosed with IR NMIBC was included in this retrospective study.  Results:   The conditional RFS rate at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years improved with increased duration of RFS; however, the conditional PFS rate did not improve over time. Multivariable analyses showed that recurrent tumour, multiple tumours, tumour size (>3 cm), immediate postoperative instillation of chemotherapy, and administration of BCG were independent predictive factors for recurrence at baseline. The predictive ability of these factors disappeared with increasing recurrence-free survivorship. Subclassification of these patients with IR NMIBC into three groups using clinicopathological factors (recurrent tumour, multiple tumours, tumour size) demonstrated that the high IR group (two factors) had significantly worse RFS than the intermediate (one factor, P < 0.001) and low IR groups (no factor, P = 0.005) at baseline. This subclassification stratified conditional risk of RFS also at 1, 3 and 5 years, which provides the basis for distinct surveillance protocols among patients with IR NMIBC.  Conclusion:   Conditional survival analyses of patients with IR NMIBC demonstrate that RFS changes over time, while PFS does not change.

We report on a cohort of individuals with CHEK2 pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants (collectively, PV) in order to better characterize this gene.  Methods:   We retrospectively queried samples submitted for multi-gene hereditary cancer testing to identify individuals with CHEK2 PVs and assessed differences in phenotypes among various genotypes.  Results:   CHEK2 PVs were identified in 2508 individuals, including 32 individuals with biallelic CHEK2 PVs. Breast (female, 59.9% and male, 11.8%), prostate (20.1%), and colorectal (3.5%), were among the most frequently reported cancers. Select missense PVs showed similar cancer prevalence to truncating PVs while some others showed lower prevalence. No significant differences were observed between biallelic carriers and heterozygotes.  Conclusions:   Our data support that some, but not all, CHEK2 missense PVs demonstrate lower cancer prevalence; further studies are needed to continue characterizing possible variant specific risks. In addition, biallelic CHEK2 PVs do not appear to be associated with a more severe phenotype than single CHEK2 PVs.

The effect of the minimal doses to the most exposed 0.5 cm3, 1 cm3, and 2 cm3 of the anorectum (respectively: D0.5cm3, D1cm3, and D2cm3), total reference air kerma (TRAK), and volume of 100% isodose was examined for anorectal toxicities.  Results:   Seventy-eight consecutive children were included. Median age was 2.9 years (range, 0.8-14.9 years). Most of the tumors were bladder or prostate (67%) or vaginal (22%) rhabdomyosarcoma. Six patients received EBRT in addition to brachytherapy. Median follow-up was 21.3 months.

Treatment with enzalutamide, a second generation androgen receptor (AR) antagonist, offers an initial response followed by drug resistance and tumor relapse. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a member of PRC2 complex, is an important target that acts as a coactivator of AR-mediated gene suppression whose oncogenic activity increases during castration. We hypothesize that dual targeting of EZH2 and AR could be highly effective in CRPC treatment. The present study aimed to examine the effectiveness of combination using EZH2 inhibitor GSK126 with antiandrogen enzalutamide in the treatment of CRPC cells. Treatment of 22Rv1 and C42B CRPC cells with a combination of GSK126 and enzalutamide led to synergistic inhibition of cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest and marked increase in cell death. Mechanistically, this combination treatment significantly reduced expression of AR and AR-v7, decrease in PSA and Akt activity, diminution of EZH2 and other members of PCR2 complex including SUZ12 and EED, with simultaneous loss of H3K27 trimethylation and dissociation between AR and PRC2 complex members compared to individual treatment. This study provides preclinical proof-of-concept that combined treatment of EZH2 inhibitor with AR antagonist results in synergistic anticancer effects opening new possibilities for treatment of CRPC tumors.""","""['Eswar Shankar', 'Daniel Franco', 'Omair Iqbal', 'Stephen Moreton', 'Rajnee Kanwal', 'Sanjay Gupta']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Toxicol Appl Pharmacol""","""['Inhibition of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Dual-Acting Peptides Target EZH2 and AR: A New Paradigm for Effective Treatment of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Epigenetic Reprogramming with Antisense Oligonucleotides Enhances the Effectiveness of Androgen Receptor Inhibition in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Enzalutamide: targeting the androgen signalling pathway in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Enzalutamide as a second generation antiandrogen for treatment of advanced prostate cancer.', 'Calcium signalling pathways in prostate cancer initiation and progression.', 'Epigenetic Coregulation of Androgen Receptor Signaling.', 'From Therapy Resistance to Targeted Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'Roles of Key Epigenetic Regulators in the Gene Transcription and Progression of Prostate Cancer.', 'Dynamic prostate cancer transcriptome analysis delineates the trajectory to disease progression.']"""

As a consequence, the depletion of testicular androgens in patients with prostate cancer results in tumor regression. However, it eventually leads to a castration-resistant disease that is highly metastatic. In this report, a mouse model of metastatic prostate cancer was generated through the deletion of the tumor-suppressor gene Trp53 in conjunction with oncogenic activation of the proto-oncogene Kras. These mice developed early-onset metastatic prostate cancer with complete penetrance. Tumors from these mice were poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, characterized by extensive epithelial-mesenchymal transition. With no or a very low level of androgen receptor expression, the tumor cells were resistant to androgen receptor inhibition. Pik3cg, encoding phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit γ (Pi3kγ), was highly expressed in these tumors, and pharmacologic inhibition of Pi3kγ blocked tumor cell growth in vitro, reversed epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and abated tumor metastasis in vivo. Immunohistochemistry analysis in human prostate cancer specimens showed that the expression of PIK3CG was significantly associated with advanced clinical stages. Taken together, these results suggest that PIK3CG plays an important role in the progression and metastasis of prostate cancer, and may represent a new therapeutic target in the metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Wen-Cheng Chung', 'Xinchun Zhou', 'Azeddine Atfi', 'Keli Xu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Am J Pathol""","""['Crosstalk between epithelial-mesenchymal transition and castration resistance mediated by Twist1/AR signaling in prostate cancer.', 'The insulin-like growth factor axis and prostate cancer: lessons from the transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) model.', 'Deletion of the p16INK4a tumor suppressor and expression of the androgen receptor induce sarcomatoid carcinomas with signet ring cells in the mouse prostate.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal-transition regulators in prostate cancer: Androgens and beyond.', 'Androgen receptors in early and castration resistant prostate cancer: friend or foe?', 'Molecular basis for Gβγ-mediated activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase γ.', 'Development and validation of a prognosis prediction model based on 18 endoplasmic reticulum stress-related genes for patients with lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Investigating the Role of Dahuang in Hepatoma Treatment Using Network Pharmacology, Molecular Docking, and Survival Analysis.', 'KRASG12R-Independent Macropinocytosis in Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Repressing phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit gamma by microRNA-142-3p restrains the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma.']"""

Furthermore, uninsured individuals with suspected bone and/or soft-tissue masses routinely encounter difficulty in obtaining access to basic healthcare (such as office visits, radiology scans), and therefore are more likely to be diagnosed with later stages at presentation. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandate of 2010 aimed to increase access to care for uninsured individuals by launching initiatives, such as expanding Medicaid eligibility, subsidizing private insurance, and developing statewide mandates requiring individuals to have a prescribed minimum level of health insurance. Although prior reports have demonstrated that the ACA increased both coverage and the proportion of early-stage diagnoses among patients with common cancers (including breast, colon, prostate, and lung), it is unknown whether similar improvements have occurred for patients with bone and soft-tissue sarcomas. Understanding changes in insurance coverages and stage at diagnosis of patients with bone and soft-tissue sarcomas would be paramount in establishing policies that will ensure orthopaedic cancer care is made equitable and accessible to all.  Questions/purposes:   (1) Has the introduction of the ACA been associated with changes in insurance coverage for adult patients with newly diagnosed bone and soft-tissue sarcomas? (2) Did the introduction of health reforms under the ACA lead to an increased proportion of sarcoma diagnoses occurring at earlier disease stages?  Methods:   The 2007 to 2015 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database was queried using International Classification of Diseases for Oncology codes for primary malignant bone tumors of the upper and lower extremity (C40.0 to C40.3), unspecified or other overlapping bone, articular cartilage, and joint and/or ribs, sternum, or clavicle (C40.8 to C40.9, C41.3, and C41.8 to C41.9), vertebral column (C41.2), pelvis (C41.4, C41.8, and C41.9), and soft-tissue sarcomas of the upper or lower extremity and/or pelvis (C49.1, C49.2, and C49.5). A total of 15,287 patients with newly diagnosed cancers were included, of which 3647 (24%) were malignant bone tumors and 11,640 (76%) were soft-tissue sarcomas. The study sample was divided into three cohorts according to specified time periods: pre-ACA from 2007 to 2010 (6537 patients), pre-Medicaid expansion from 2011 to 2013 (5076 patients), and post-Medicaid expansion from 2014 to 2015 (3674 patients). The Pearson chi square tests were used to assess for changes in the proportion of Medicaid and uninsured patients across the specified time periods: pre-ACA, pre-expansion and post-expansion. A differences-in-differences analysis was also performed to assess changes in insurance coverage for Medicaid and uninsured patients among states that chose to expand Medicaid coverage in 2014 under the ACA's provision versus those who opted out of Medicaid expansion. Since the database switched to using the American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) 7th edition staging system in 2010, linear regression using data only from 2010 to 2015 was performed that assessed changes in cancer stage at diagnosis from 2010 to 2015 alone. After stratifying by cancer type (bone or soft-tissue sarcoma), Pearson chi square tests were used to assess for changes in the proportion of patients who were diagnosed with early, late, and unknown stage at presentation before Medicaid expansion (2011-2013) and after Medicaid expansion (2014-2015) among states that chose to expand versus those who did not.  Results:   After stratifying by time cohorts: pre-ACA (2007 to 2010), pre-expansion (2011 to 2013) and post-expansion (2014 to 2015), we observed that the most dramatic changes occurred after Medicaid eligibility was expanded (2014 onwards), with Medicaid proportions increasing from 12% (pre-expansion, 2011 to 2013) to 14% (post-expansion, 2014 to 2015) (p < 0.001) and uninsured proportions decreasing from 5% (pre-expansion, 2011 to 2013) to 3% (post-expansion, 2014 to 2015) (p < 0.001). A differences-in-differences analysis that assessed the effect of Medicaid expansion showed that expanded states had an increase in the proportion of Medicaid patients compared with non-expanded states, (3.6% [95% confidence interval 0.4 to 6.8]; p = 0.03) from 2014 onwards. For the entire study sample, the proportion of early-stage diagnoses (I/II) increased from 56% (939 of 1667) in 2010 to 62% (1137 of 1840) in 2015 (p = 0.003). Similarly, the proportion of unknown stage diagnoses decreased from 11% (188 of 1667) in 2010 to 7% (128 of 1840) in 2015 (p = 0.002). There was no change in proportion of late-stage diagnoses (III/IV) from 32% (540 of 1667) in 2010 to 31% (575 of 1840) in 2015 (p = 0.13).  Conclusion:   Access to cancer care for patients with primary bone or soft-tissue sarcomas improved after the ACA was introduced, as evidenced by a decrease in the proportion of uninsured patients and corresponding increase in Medicaid coverage. Improvements in coverage were most significant among states that adopted the Medicaid expansion of 2014. Furthermore, we observed an increasing proportion of early-stage diagnoses after the ACA was implemented. The findings support the preservation of the ACA to ensure cancer care is equitable and accessible to all vulnerable patient populations.

Increasing evidence suggests that LncRNAs are frequently dysregulated in cancer and may function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Urothelial carcinoma associated 1 (UCA1), a LncRNA, firstly identified in bladder transitional cell carcinoma, seems to act as an oncogene in many different types of human cancers by promoting cell proliferation and migration. In this study, we revealed a novel biological function of UCA1, which was different from that reported by previous studies, was responsible for maintaining the low-tumorigenic, nonmetastatic phenotypes in primary prostate epithelial cells. UCA1 could stabilize E-cadherin protein by preventing the interaction between E-cadherin and its E3 ligase MDM2, which suppressed MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of E-cadherin. In addition, we also found that UCA1 acted as a sponge of miR-296-3p, which targeted E-cadherin gene CDH1 messenger RNA at the posttranscription level. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that UCA1 had a new important role in effectively keeping E-cadherin at a high level through a dual mechanism, which maintained primary prostate cancer cells at the low-tumorigenic and nonmetastatic status.""","""['Xian Zhao', 'Yanli Wang', 'Jianfeng He', 'Rong Deng', 'Xiaojun Huang', 'Yanmin Guo', 'Lian Li', 'Ruiyu Xie', 'Jianxiu Yu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Carcinog""","""['11 Long noncoding RNA UCA1 functions as miR-135a sponge to promote the epithelial to mesenchymal transition in glioma.', ""SATB1 3'-UTR and lncRNA-UCA1 competitively bind to miR-495-3p and together regulate the proliferation and invasion of gastric cancer."", 'miR-200c overexpression inhibits the invasion and tumorigenicity of epithelial ovarian cancer cells by suppressing lncRNA HOTAIR in mice.', 'Crosstalk between the lncRNA UCA1 and microRNAs in cancer.', 'The Functional Role of Long Non-coding RNA UCA1 in Human Multiple Cancers: a Review Study.', 'Over-expression of Long Non-coding RNA Urothelial Cancer-associated 1 as a Predictive Marker for Prostate Cancer.', 'Low level TGF-β1-treated Umbilical mesenchymal stem cells attenuates microgliosis and neuropathic pain in chronic constriction injury by exosomes/lncRNA UCA1／miR-96-5p／FOXO3a.', 'Ehm2 transcript variant 1 inhibits breast cancer progression and increases E-cadherin stability.', 'Endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein Sec62 drives colorectal cancer metastasis via MAPK/ATF2/UCA1 axis.', 'Trophoblast Exosomal UCA1 Induces Endothelial Injury through the PFN1-RhoA/ROCK Pathway in Preeclampsia: A Human-Specific Adaptive Pathogenic Mechanism.']"""

Using Firth logistic regression, we estimated adjusted 1-year odds of OUD or nonfatal opioid overdose associated with a cancer diagnosis. We also estimated adjusted odds of OUD and overdose separately and by cancer stage, prior opioid use, and follow-up time.  Results:   Among 69 889 cancer survivors and 125 007 controls, the unadjusted rates of OUD or nonfatal overdose were 25.2, 27.1, 38.9, and 12.4 events per 10 000 patients in the noncancer, breast, colorectal, and prostate samples, respectively. There was no association between cancer and OUD. Colorectal survivors had 2.3 times higher odds of opioid overdose compared with matched controls (adjusted odds ratio = 2.33, 95% confidence interval = 1.49 to 3.67). Additionally, overdose risk was greater in those with more advanced disease, no prior opioid use, and preexisting mental health conditions.  Conclusions:   Opioid overdose was a rare, but statistically significant, outcome following stage II-III colorectal cancer diagnosis, particularly among previously opioid-naïve patients. These patients may require heightened screening and intervention to prevent inadvertent adverse opioid harms.""","""['Andrew W Roberts', 'Samantha Eiffert', 'Elizabeth M Wulff-Burchfield', 'Stacie B Dusetzina', 'Devon K Check']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst""","""['Association of Current Opioid Use With Serious Adverse Events Among Older Adult Survivors of Breast Cancer.', 'Regional and temporal variation in receipt of long-term opioid therapy among older breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer survivors in the United States.', 'Trends in opioid use disorder and overdose among opioid-naive individuals receiving an opioid prescription in Massachusetts from 2011 to 2014.', 'Trends in the prevalence of malignancy among patients admitted with acute heart failure and associated outcomes: a nationwide population-based study.', 'Opioid Use Disorder.', 'Risk of an Opioid-Related Emergency Department Visit or Hospitalization Among Older Breast, Colorectal, Lung, and Prostate Cancer Survivors.', 'Predictors of Chronic Opioid Use: A Population-Level Analysis of North Carolina Cancer Survivors Using Multi-Payer Claims.']"""

A classical machine learning pipeline consists of several steps, including normalization, feature selection, and classification. It is often tedious to find an optimal pipeline with appropriate combinations. We designed an open-source software package named FeAture Explorer (FAE). It was programmed with Python and used NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learning modules. FAE can be used to extract image features, preprocess the feature matrix, develop different models automatically, and evaluate them with common clinical statistics. FAE features a user-friendly graphical user interface that can be used by radiologists and researchers to build many different pipelines, and to compare their results visually. To prove the effectiveness of FAE, we developed a candidate model to classify the clinical-significant prostate cancer (CS PCa) and non-CS PCa using the PROSTATEx dataset. We used FAE to try out different combinations of feature selectors and classifiers, compare the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of different models on the validation dataset, and evaluate the model using independent test data. The final model with the analysis of variance as the feature selector and linear discriminate analysis as the classifier was selected and evaluated conveniently by FAE. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve on the training, validation, and test dataset achieved results of 0.838, 0.814, and 0.824, respectively. FAE allows researchers to build radiomics models and evaluate them using an independent testing dataset. It also provides easy model comparison and result visualization. We believe FAE can be a convenient tool for radiomics studies and other medical studies involving supervised machine learning.""","""['Yang Song', 'Jing Zhang', 'Yu-Dong Zhang', 'Ying Hou', 'Xu Yan', 'Yida Wang', 'Minxiong Zhou', 'Ye-Feng Yao', 'Guang Yang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['A new machine learning based user-friendly software platform for automatic radiomics modeling and analysis.', 'An investigation of machine learning methods in delta-radiomics feature analysis.', 'Radiomics and machine learning of multisequence multiparametric prostate MRI: Towards improved non-invasive prostate cancer characterization.', 'Multiparametric Data-driven Imaging Markers: Guidelines for Development, Application and Reporting of Model Outputs in Radiomics.', 'Overview of radiomics in prostate imaging and future directions.', 'The MRI radiomics signature can predict the pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Multiparametric MRI radiomics in prostate cancer for predicting Ki-67 expression and Gleason score: a multicenter retrospective study.', 'Model incorporating multiple diffusion MRI features: development and validation of a radiomics-based model to predict adult-type diffuse gliomas grade.', 'Prediction of 1p/19q codeletion status in diffuse lower-grade glioma using multimodal MRI radiomics.', 'Radiomics analysis of contrast-enhanced computed tomography in predicting the International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification in neuroblastoma.']"""

He was diagnosed with T3aN0M1b prostate adenocarcinoma. A combined androgen blockade using luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist (the 1-month depot of leuprorelin acetate) and antiandrogen was administered.

The 1-month depot was switched to the 3-month depot in May 2013, but the patient complained of induration and abscess at the infection site. Leuprorelin acetate was replaced by goserelin acetate. Because no adverse event appeared after injection of the 1-month depot of goserelin acetate, the 3-month depot was administered in October 2013. The PSA level increased gradually, and the testosterone level was greater than 50 ng/dl, that is, above castrate range. The 3-month depot of both leuprorelin acetate and goserelin acetate was not effective for this patient. For this reason, the 1-month depot of leuprorelin acetate was started resulting in a rapid decrease in PSA and testosterone levels. Thereafter, androgen depriving therapy could be continued. Androgen deprivation therapy is the standard treatment for patients with advanced prostate cancer and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone aims to suppress serum testosterone to castrate range.

Material and method:   30 patients with prostate cancer (PCa), 40 with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), and 30 controls were studied. Personal information, ccfDNA concentration, and the integrity index were assessed for the correlation between the disease and different factors. The results were statistically analyzed using SPSS software.  Results:   In PCa group, no association was found between total ccfDNA, BMI, BPH background, non-cancerous diseases, medications, PCa length, and job (p-value > 0.05).

It is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men in the US, second only to lung and bronchus cancer. Advanced and metastatic PC is initially treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), but nearly all cases eventually progress to castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). CRPC is incurable in the metastatic stage but can be slowed by some conventional chemotherapeutics and second-generation ADT, such as enzalutamide and abiraterone. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is overexpressed in almost all aggressive PCs. PSMA is widely used as a target for PC imaging and drug delivery. Anti-PSMA monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been developed as bioligands for diagnostic imaging and targeted PC therapy. However, these mAbs are successfully used in PC imaging and only a few have gone beyond phase-I for targeted therapy. The 5D3 mAb is a novel, high-affinity, and fast-internalizing anti-PSMA antibody. Importantly, 5D3 mAb demonstrates a unique pattern of cellular localization to the centrosome after internalization in PSMA(+) PC3-PIP cells. These characteristics make 5D3 mAb an ideal bioligand to deliver tubulin inhibitors, such as mertansine, to the cell centrosome, leading to mitotic arrest and elimination of dividing PC cells. We have successfully developed a 5D3 mAb- and mertansine (DM1)-based antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) and evaluated it in vitro for binding affinity, internalization, and cytotoxicity. The in vivo therapeutic efficacy of 5D3-DM1 ADC was evaluated in PSMA(+) PC3-PIP and PSMA(-) PC3-Flu mouse models of human PC. This therapeutic study has revealed that this new anti-PSMA ADC can successfully control the growth of PSMA(+) tumors without inducing systemic toxicity.""","""['Colin T Huang', 'Xin Guo', 'Cyril Bařinka', 'Shawn E Lupold', 'Martin G Pomper', 'Kathleen Gabrielson', 'Venu Raman', 'Dmitri Artemov', 'Sudath Hapuarachchige']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['Cellular Delivery of Bioorthogonal Pretargeting Therapeutics in PSMA-Positive Prostate Cancer.', 'In vitro and in vivo responses of advanced prostate tumors to PSMA ADC, an auristatin-conjugated antibody to prostate-specific membrane antigen.', 'Enzalutamide Enhances PSMA Expression of PSMA-Low Prostate Cancer.', 'Efficacy Against Human Prostate Cancer by Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-specific, Transforming Growth Factor-β Insensitive Genetically Targeted CD8+ T-cells Derived from Patients with Metastatic Castrate-resistant Disease.', 'Radioimmunotherapy of Metastatic Prostate Cancer with ¹⁷⁷Lu-DOTAhuJ591 Anti Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen Specific Monoclonal Antibody.', 'Development of radiopharmaceuticals for targeted alpha therapy: Where do we stand?', 'Antibody-drug conjugates: beyond current approvals and potential future strategies.', 'Modular Smart Molecules for PSMA-Targeted Chemotherapy.', 'Theranostic Small-Molecule Prodrug Conjugates for Targeted Delivery and Controlled Release of Toll-like Receptor 7 Agonists.', 'Antibody-Drug Conjugates in Uro-Oncology.']"""

Methods:   A probe panel was developed and optimized to measure CNAs in trace amounts of tumor DNA (2 ng) isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. Ten genes previously associated with aggressive disease were targeted. The panel's feasibility and performance were assessed in 175 prostate cancer (PCa) patients who underwent radical prostatectomy with a median 10-year follow-up, including 42 men who developed disease progression (either metastasis and/or PCa-specific death). Association with disease progression was tested using univariable and multivariable analyses.  Results:   The probe panel detected CNAs in all 10 genes in tumor DNA isolated from either diagnostic biopsies or surgical specimens. A four-gene model (PTEN/MYC/BRCA2/CDKN1B) had the strongest association with disease progression; 64.3% of progressors and 22.5% of non-progressors had at least one CNA in these four genes, odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval) = 6.21 (2.77-13.87), P = 8.48E-06. The association with disease progression remained significant after adjusting for known clinicopathological variables. Among the seven progressors of the 65 patients with clinically low-risk disease, three (42.9%) had at least one CNA in these four genes.  Conclusions:   The probe panel can detect CNAs in trace amounts of tumor DNA from biopsies or surgical tissues at the time of diagnosis or surgery.

It is mainly caused by both ""aerobic"" and ""anaerobic"" glycolysis of differently adapted cancer cells, with the final product lactic acid being responsible of the extracellular acidification. Many evidences underline the role of extracellular acidosis in tumor progression. Among the different findings, we demonstrated that acidosis-exposed cancer cells are characterized by an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype with high invasive ability, high resistance to apoptosis, anchorage-independent growth, and drug therapy. Acidic melanoma cells over-express SOX2, which is crucial for the maintenance of their oxidative metabolism, and carbonic anhydrase IX, that correlates with poor prognosis of cancer patients. Considering these evidences, we realized that the profile outlined for acid cancer cells inevitably remind us the stemness profile. Therefore, we wondered whether extracellular acidosis might induce in cancer cells the acquisition of stem-like properties and contribute to the expansion of the cancer stem cell sub-population. We found that a chronic adaptation to acidosis stimulates in cancer cells the expression of stem-related markers, also providing a high in vitro/in vivo clonogenic and trans-differentiating ability. Moreover, we observed that the acidosis-induced stem-like phenotype of melanoma cells was reversible and related to the EMT induction. These findings help to characterize a further aspect of stem cell niche, contributing to the sustainment and expansion of cancer stem cell subpopulation. Thus, the usage of agents controlling tumor extracellular acidosis might acquire great importance in the clinic for the treatment of aggressive solid tumor. KEY MESSAGES: • Extracellular acidosis up-regulates EMT and stem-related markers in melanoma cells • Acidic medium up-regulates in vitro self-renewal capacity of melanoma cells • Chronic acidosis adaptation induces trans-differentiation ability in melanoma cells • Melanoma cells adapted to acidosis show higher tumor-initiating potential than control cells • Extracellular acidosis promotes a stem-like phenotype in prostate and colorectal carcinoma cells.""","""['Elena Andreucci', 'Silvia Peppicelli', 'Jessica Ruzzolini', 'Francesca Bianchini', 'Alessio Biagioni', 'Laura Papucci', 'Lucia Magnelli', 'Benedetta Mazzanti', 'Barbara Stecca', 'Lido Calorini']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Mol Med (Berl)""","""['Phenotypic transition of tumor cells between epithelial- and mesenchymal-like state during adaptation to acidosis.', 'Carbonic anhydrase IX inhibition affects viability of cancer cells adapted to extracellular acidosis.', 'Metformin is also effective on lactic acidosis-exposed melanoma cells switched to oxidative phosphorylation.', 'Acidic tumor microenvironment in human melanoma.', 'Cellular and molecular biology of cancer stem cells in melanoma: Possible therapeutic implications.', 'Functional characterization of acid-sensing ion channels in the cerebellum-originating medulloblastoma cell line DAOY and in cerebellar granule neurons.', 'ECM Composition Differentially Regulates Intracellular and Extracellular pH in Normal and Cancer Pancreatic Duct Epithelial Cells.', 'Acidic Growth Conditions Promote Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition to Select More Aggressive PDAC Cell Phenotypes In Vitro.', 'Extracellular Lactic Acidosis of the Tumor Microenvironment Drives Adipocyte-to-Myofibroblast Transition Fueling the Generation of Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts.', 'Microbiota-Derived Natural Products Targeting Cancer Stem Cells: Inside the Gut Pharma Factory.']"""

Therefore, it is very necessary to develop a more efficient and safer type of CBL derivate against tumors with selective targeting of cancer cells. In addition, the natural product of honokiol (HN), the novel potent chemo-preventive or therapeutic entity/carrier, can target the mitochondria of cancer cells through STAT3 to prevent cancer from spreading and metastasizing. In this study, we designed and synthesized the honokiol-chlorambucil (HN-CBL) co-prodrugs through carbonate ester linkage conjugating with the targeted delivery help of the HN skeleton in cancer cells. Biological evaluation indicated that HN-CBL can remarkably enhance the antiproliferation of human leukemic cell lines CCRF-CEM, Jurkat, U937, MV4-11, and K562. Furthermore, HN-CBL can also selectively inhibit the lymphocytic leukemia (LL) cell survival compared to those mononuclear cells derived from healthy donors (PBMCs), enhance mitochondrial activity in leukemia cells, and induce LL cell apoptosis. Molecular docking and western blot study showed that HN-CBL can also bind with the STAT3 protein at some hydrophobic residues and downregulate the phosphorylation level of STAT3-like HN. Significantly, HN-CBL could dramatically delay leukemia growth in vivo with no observable physiological toxicity. Thus, HN-CBL may provide a novel and effective targeting therapeutic against LL with fewer side effects.""","""['Li Xia', 'Dali Kang', 'Dan Wan', 'Chu Chu', 'Meizi Chen', 'Shuihan Zhang', 'Xiong Li', 'Leye He', 'Jianye Yan', 'Teng Liu', 'Yongbo Peng']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""ACS Omega""","""['A Prodrug of Two Approved Drugs, Cisplatin and Chlorambucil, for Chemo War Against Cancer.', 'Re-directing an alkylating agent to mitochondria alters drug target and cell death mechanism.', 'Novel molecular anti-colorectalcancer conjugate:chlorambucil-adipic acid dihydrizide-glutamine.', 'Combinatorial Low Dose Arsenic Trioxide and Cisplatin Exacerbates Autophagy via AMPK/STAT3 Signaling on Targeting Head and Neck Cancer Initiating Cells.', 'Chlorambucil in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: mechanism of action.']"""

Managing these patients are currently challenging. Hence, there is an unmet need for further efficient therapeutic options that induce anti-tumor activity and improve survival. The objective of this study was to assess the safety and therapeutic efficacy of 225Ac-PSMA-617 targeted alpha therapy (TAT) in mCRPC patients in real-world conditions. Methods: In this prospective study, we recruited patients with mCRPC who either were refractory to 177Lu-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy (RLT) or did not receive previous 177Lu-PSMA-617 RLT. Patients were treated with 225Ac-PSMA-617 TAT (100 KBq/Kg body weight) at 8-weekly intervals. The primary endpoint included the assessment of biochemical response by measuring the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate as per the prostate cancer working group criteria (PCWG3). Secondary endpoints comprised the estimation of overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), molecular tumor response assessment (PERCIST 1 criteria), disease control rate (DCR), toxicity according to CTCAE v5.0, and clinical response evaluation. Results: A total of 28 patients were recruited for this cohort study among whom 15 (54%) received prior 177Lu-PSMA-617 RLT and the remaining 13 (46%) patients were 177Lu-PSMA-617 RLT naïve.

The mean activity administered was 26.5 ± 12 MBq (range: 9.25 - 62.9 MBq) [715.5 ± 327 µCi, range: 250 - 1700 µCi] with a median of 3 cycles (range: 1 - 7 cycles). At 8th week of post first cycle of 225Ac-PSMA-617 therapy (initial follow-up) and the end of the follow-up, >50% decline in PSA was observed in 25% and 39%, respectively. The median PFS and OS were 12 months (95% CI: 9 - 13 months) and 17 months (95% CI: 16 months - upper limit not reached), respectively. Molecular tumor response by PERCIST 1 criteria could be conducted in 22/28 (78.6%) patients, which revealed complete response in 2/22 (9%), partial response in 10/22 (45.4%) patients, 2/22 (9%) with stable disease, and 8/22 (36%) with progressive diseases. The disease control rate, according to the biochemical and molecular tumor response criteria, was 82% and 63.6%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed PSA progression as adverse prognostic indicator of OS, and any PSA decline as a good prognostic indicator of PFS. There was no Grade III/IV toxicity noted in this series. The most common side-effect was transient fatigue (50%) followed by grade I/II xerostomia (29%). Conclusion:225Ac-PSMA-617 TAT showed promising disease control rate, even when all other therapeutic options were exhausted, with low treatment-related toxicities.""","""['Madhav Prasad Yadav', 'Sanjana Ballal', 'Ranjit Kumar Sahoo', 'Madhavi Tripathi', 'Amlesh Seth', 'Chandrasekhar Bal']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Therapeutic efficacy, prognostic variables and clinical outcome of 177Lu-PSMA-617 PRLT in progressive mCRPC following multiple lines of treatment: prognostic implications of high FDG uptake on dual tracer PET-CT vis-à-vis Gleason score in such cohort.', 'Predictors of Overall and Disease-Free Survival in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients Receiving 225Ac-PSMA-617 Radioligand Therapy.', 'Molecular imaging and biochemical response assessment after a single cycle of 225AcAc-PSMA-617/177LuLu-PSMA-617 tandem therapy in mCRPC patients who have progressed on 177LuLu-PSMA-617 monotherapy.', 'Hematologic toxicity profile and efficacy of 225AcAc-PSMA-617 α-radioligand therapy of patients with extensive skeletal metastases of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'PSMA radioligand therapy in patients with advanced prostate cancer.', 'The current status of prostate cancer treatment and PSMA theranostics.', '225Ac-Labeled Somatostatin Analogs in the Management of Neuroendocrine Tumors: From Radiochemistry to Clinic.', 'Patient outcomes following a response biomarker-guided approach to treatment using 177Lu-PSMA-I&T in men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (Re-SPECT).', '225Ac-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy of de novo metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate carcinoma (mHSPC): preliminary clinical findings.', 'Prostate specific membrane antigen binding radiopharmaceuticals: Current data and new concepts.']"""

Compared to that of linear mRNA transcripts, the stability of circRNAs against degradation owing to their circular structure is considered advantageous for their use as biomarkers. As systematic studies on the stability of circRNAs depending on the RNA integrity, determined as RNA integrity number (RIN), in clinical tissue samples are lacking, we have investigated this aspect in the present study under model and clinical conditions. Methods: Total RNA isolated from kidney cancer tissue and cell lines (A-498 and HEK-293) with different RIN after thermal degradation was used in model experiments. Further, RNA isolated from kidney cancer and prostate cancer tissue collected under routine surgical conditions, representing clinical samples with RIN ranging from 2 to 9, were examined. Quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis of several circRNAs (circEGLN3, circRHOBTB3, circCSNK1G3, circRNA4, and circRNA9), their corresponding linear counterparts, tissue-specific reference genes, and three microRNAs (as controls) was performed. The quantification cycles were converted into relative quantities and normalized to the expression of specific reference genes for the corresponding tissue. The effect of RIN on the expression of different RNA entities was determined using linear regression analysis, and clinical samples were classified into two groups based on RIN greater or lesser than 6. Results: The results of model experiments and clinical sample analyses showed that all relative circRNA expression gradually decreased with reduction in RIN values. The adverse effect of RIN was partially compensated after normalizing the data and limiting the samples to only those with RIN values > 6. Conclusions: Our results suggested that circRNAs are not stable in clinical tissue samples, but are subjected to degradative processes similar to mRNAs. This has not been investigated extensively in circRNA expression studies, and hence must be considered in future for obtaining reliable circRNA expression data. This can be achieved by applying the principles commonly used in mRNA expression studies.""","""['Hannah Rochow', 'Antonia Franz', 'Monika Jung', 'Sabine Weickmann', 'Bernhard Ralla', 'Ergin Kilic', 'Carsten Stephan', 'Annika Fendler', 'Klaus Jung']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Circular RNAs and Their Linear Transcripts as Diagnostic and Prognostic Tissue Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer after Prostatectomy in Combination with Clinicopathological Factors.', 'Identification of internal control genes for circular RNAs.', 'Robust microRNA stability in degraded RNA preparations from human tissue and cell samples.', 'Review on circular RNAs and new insights into their roles in cancer.', 'A novel strategy of identifying circRNA biomarkers in cardiovascular disease by meta-analysis.', 'Exploratory Circular RNA Profiling in Adrenocortical Tumors.', 'Circular RNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells are more stable than linear RNAs upon sample processing delay.', 'Cost-Effective Transcriptome-Wide Profiling of Circular RNAs by the Improved-tdMDA-NGS Method.', 'Circular RNAs in prostate cancer: Biogenesis,biological functions, and clinical significance.', 'CRISPR/Cas13-Based Platforms for a Potential Next-Generation Diagnosis of Colorectal Cancer through Exosomes Micro-RNA Detection: A Review.']"""

Radiotherapy enhances the expression of 12-LOX in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Two types of macrophages can be found in the tumor microenvironment. The M2 subtype accelerates tumor progression; however, the relationship between 12-LOX and macrophages is not well established. Here, we explore this interaction and its effect on ESCC to induce tumor progression.  Methods and results:   RT-qPCR and Western blot analyses were used to evaluate the mRNA and protein expression levels of 12-LOX and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5) in ESCC after radiotherapy. CCL5 expression was increased by 12-LOX upregulation but was suppressed by the well-established 12-LOX inhibitor, baicalein. Furthermore, CCL5 attracted and repolarized human myeloid leukemia mononuclear cells (THP-1)-derived macrophages. Finally, ESCC co-culture with THP-1-derived macrophages led to a strong cancer migratory capacity.

However, its exact role in regulating the development of PCa is obscure.  Methods:   The EMX2OS expression was assessed in PCa tissues, paracancer tissues, PCa cells and normal prostate epithelial cells by qPCR. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were performed to investigate the role of EMX2OS and FUS in cGMP-PKG (cyclic guanosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase)-mediated proliferation, invasion, and migration in human PCa cell lines DU145 and PC3. Then, the interaction of transcription factor 12 (TCF12) with EMX2OS promoter was confirmed by using the dual-luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation and RNA pull-down assays were used to verify the interaction between EMX2OS and FUS protein. Finally, the role of EMX2OS and FUS in tumor growth in vivo was validated in a xenograft nude mouse model.  Results:   TCF12 and EMX2OS were both downregulated in PCa tissues and cells, and they negatively regulated cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and activated cGMP-PKG pathway in DU145 and PC3 cells. TCF12 was a transcription factor of EMX2OS. TCF12 and EMX2OS overexpression both down-regulated cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and activated cGMP-PKG pathway in DU145 and PC3 cells. Furthermore, EMX2OS directly bound with FUS protein and had a synergy effect with FUS protein on cGMP-PKG-mediated cell functions, which could be suppressed by (D)-DT-2 (a cGMP-PKG inhibitor). In addition, the overexpression of FUS or EMX2OS individually markedly decreased the volume and weight of tumors in vivo, and co-overexpression of them further inhibited tumor growth.

However, Tween 80 injection can cause serious allergic reactions, and CBZ itself has strong toxicity, adverse reactions, and poor tumor selectivity, which greatly limits its clinical applications. Therefore, the CBZ-loaded bovine serum albumin nanoparticles (CBZ-BSA-Gd-NPs) were developed to overcome the allergenic response of Tween 80 and realize the integration of diagnosis and treatment.  Methods:   CBZ-BSA-Gd-NPs were prepared by the biomineralization method. The characterization, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), safety, and antitumor activity of the nanoparticles were evaluated in vitro and in vivo.  Results:   The prepared nanoparticles were uniform in size (166 nm), with good MRI performance and stability over 24 h. Compared with CBZ-Tween 80 injection, CBZ-BSA-Gd-NPs showed much lower hemolysis, similar tumor inhibition, and enhanced cellular uptake in vitro. The pharmacokinetic behavior of CBZ-BSA-Gd-NPs in rats showed that the retention time of the nanoparticles was prolonged, the clearance rate decreased, and the area under the drug-time curve increased. The distribution of CBZ-BSA-Gd-NPs in nude mice was characterized by UPLC-MS/MS and MRI, and the results showed that CBZ-BSA-Gd-NPs could effectively target tumor tissues with reduced distribution in the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys compared with CBZ-Tween 80, which indicated that CBZ-BSA-Gd-NPs not only had a passive targeting effect on tumor tissue but also achieved the integration of diagnosis and treatment. In vivo, CBZ-BSA-Gd-NPs showed improved tumor inhibitory effect with a safer profile.  Conclusion:   In summary, CBZ-BSA-Gd-NPs can serve as an effective therapeutic drug carrier to deliver CBZ into prostate cancer, and realize the integration of diagnosis and therapy.""","""['Zhong Wan#', 'Fangyuan Xie#', 'Liang Wang', 'Guoqing Zhang', 'Hai Zhang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Nanomedicine""","""['Cabazitaxel-loaded human serum albumin nanoparticles as a therapeutic agent against prostate cancer.', 'Pharmacokinetics and in vitro/in vivo antitumor efficacy of aptamer-targeted Ecoflex® nanoparticles for docetaxel delivery in ovarian cancer.', 'Preparation and Evaluation of in vitro Self-assembling HSA Nanoparticles for Cabazitaxel.', 'Transferrin-coated gadolinium-labeled human serum albumin nanoparticles.', 'Biotinylated bovine serum albumin linked to gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid.', 'Cabazitaxel-Loaded Nanoparticles Reduce the Invasiveness in Metastatic Prostate Cancer Cells: Beyond the Classical Taxane Function.', 'Mitotane Nanocarriers for the Treatment of Adrenocortical Carcinoma: Evaluation of Albumin-Stabilized Nanoparticles and Liposomes in a Preclinical In Vitro Study with 3D Spheroids.', 'Biocompatible Nanomaterials as an Emerging Technology in Reproductive Health; a Focus on the Male.', 'Combination Therapy of Metastatic Castration-Recurrent Prostate Cancer: Hyaluronic Acid Decorated, Cabazitaxel-Prodrug and Orlistat Co-Loaded Nano-System.', 'Functionalized Selenium Nanotherapeutics Synergizes With Zoledronic Acid to Suppress Prostate Cancer Cell Growth Through Induction of Mitochondria-Mediated Apoptosis and Cell Cycle S Phase Arrest.']"""

Emerging evidence shows that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play vital roles in cancer initiation and progression. However, the inherited mechanisms of how lncRNAs participate in PCa progression and treatment resistance remain unclear. Here, we found that a long noncoding RNA LINC00675 was upregulated in androgen-insensitive PCa cell lines and CRPC patients, which promoted PCa progression both in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of LINC00675 markedly suppressed tumor formation and attenuated enzalutamide resistance of PCa cells. Mechanistically, LINC00675 could directly modulate androgen receptor's (AR) interaction with mouse double minute-2 (MDM2) and block AR's ubiquitination by binding to it. Meanwhile, LINC00675 could bind to GATA2 mRNA and stabilize its expression level, in which GATA2 could act as a co-activator in the AR signaling pathway. Notably, we treated subcutaneous xenografts models with enzalutamide and antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) targeting LINC00675 in vivo and found that targeting LINC00675 would benefit androgen-deprivation-insensitive models.

PCa mainly metastasizes in the bone, forming osteosclerotic lesions, inducing pain, fractures, and nerve compression. Cancer cell-derived exosomes participate in the metastatic spread, ranging from oncogenic reprogramming to the formation of pre-metastatic niches. Moreover, exosomes were recently involved in the dialog between PCa cells and the bone metastasis microenvironment. Phospholipase D (PLD) isoforms PLD1/2 catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine to yield phosphatidic acid (PA), regulating tumor progression and metastasis. PLD is suspected to play a role in exosomes biogenesis. We aimed to determine whether PCa-derived exosomes, through PLD, interact with the bone microenvironment, especially osteoblasts, during the metastatic process. Here we demonstrate for the first time that PLD2 is present in exosomes of C4-2B and PC-3 cells. C4-2B-derived exosomes activate proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts models, by stimulating ERK 1/2 phosphorylation, by increasing the tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase activity and the expression of osteogenic differentiation markers. Contrariwise, when C4-2B exosomes are generated in the presence of halopemide, a PLD pan-inhibitor, they lose their ability to stimulate osteoblasts. Furthermore, the number of released exosomes diminishes significantly (-40%). When the PLD product PA is combined with halopemide, exosome secretion is fully restored. Taken together, our results indicate that PLD2 stimulates exosome secretion in PCa cell models as well as their ability to increase osteoblast activity.

Objective:   To detect new genetic variants associated with PCa, capitalizing on the role of family history and more aggressive PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   A two-stage design was used. In stage one, whole-exome sequencing was used to identify potential risk alleles among affected men with a strong family history of disease or with more aggressive disease (491 cases and 429 controls). Aggressive disease was based on a sum of scores for Gleason score, node status, metastasis, tumor stage, prostate-specific antigen at diagnosis, systemic recurrence, and time to PCa death. Genes identified in stage one were screened in stage two using a custom-capture design in an independent set of 2917 cases and 1899 controls.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Frequencies of genetic variants (singly or jointly in a gene) were compared between cases and controls.  Results and limitations:   Eleven genes previously reported to be associated with PCa were detected (ATM, BRCA2, HOXB13, FAM111A, EMSY, HNF1B, KLK3, MSMB, PCAT1, PRSS3, and TERT), as well as an additional 10 novel genes (PABPC1, QK1, FAM114A1, MUC6, MYCBP2, RAPGEF4, RNASEH2B, ULK4, XPO7, and THAP3). Of these 10 novel genes, all but PABPC1 and ULK4 were primarily associated with the risk of aggressive PCa.  Conclusions:   Our approach demonstrates the advantage of gene sequencing in the search for genetic variants associated with PCa and the benefits of sampling patients with a strong family history of disease or an aggressive form of disease.  Patient summary:   Multiple genes are associated with prostate cancer (PCa) among men with a strong family history of this disease or among men with an aggressive form of PCa.""","""['Daniel J Schaid', 'Shannon K McDonnell', 'Liesel M FitzGerald', 'Lissa DeRycke', 'Zachary Fogarty', 'Graham G Giles', 'Robert J MacInnis', 'Melissa C Southey', 'Tu Nguyen-Dumont', 'Geraldine Cancel-Tassin', 'Oliver Cussenot', 'Alice S Whittemore', 'Weiva Sieh', 'Nilah Monnier Ioannidis', 'Chih-Lin Hsieh', 'Janet L Stanford', 'Johanna Schleutker', 'Cheryl D Cropp', 'John Carpten', 'Josef Hoegel', 'Rosalind Eeles', 'Zsofia Kote-Jarai', 'Michael J Ackerman', 'Christopher J Klein', 'Diptasri Mandal', 'Kathleen A Cooney', 'Joan E Bailey-Wilson', 'Brian Helfand', 'William J Catalona', 'Fredrick Wiklund', 'Shaun Riska', 'Saurabh Bahetti', 'Melissa C Larson', 'Lisa Cannon Albright', 'Craig Teerlink', 'Jianfeng Xu', 'William Isaacs', 'Elaine A Ostrander', 'Stephen N Thibodeau']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Findings from a Genetic Sequencing Investigation of Men with Familial and Aggressive Prostate Cancer.', 'Mutations in ATM, NBN and BRCA2 predispose to aggressive prostate cancer in Poland.', 'A 17-gene assay to predict prostate cancer aggressiveness in the context of Gleason grade heterogeneity, tumor multifocality, and biopsy undersampling.', 'Germline DNA Repair Gene Mutations in Young-onset Prostate Cancer Cases in the UK: Evidence for a More Extensive Genetic Panel.', 'Genetic Risk Prediction for Prostate Cancer: Implications for Early Detection and Prevention.', 'Role of Genetic Testing for Inherited Prostate Cancer Risk: Philadelphia Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference 2017.', 'UHRF1/DNMT1-MZF1 axis-modulated intragenic site-specific CpGI methylation confers divergent expression and opposing functions of PRSS3 isoforms in lung cancer.', 'Genetic Polymorphisms of the Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase Gene in Relation to Prostate Tumorigenesis, Aggressiveness and Mortality: A Cross-Ancestry Analysis.', 'MYCBP2 expression correlated with inflammatory cell infiltration and prognosis immunotherapy in thyroid cancer patients.', 'Circ-CREBBP inhibits sperm apoptosis via the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway by sponging miR-10384 and miR-143-3p.', 'Integrative analysis reveals a clinicogenomic landscape associated with liver metastasis and poor prognosis in hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the stomach.']"""

In 2008, the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommended against screening men aged ≥ 75 years, and in 2012, expanded this to include all men. The impact of these changes continues to unfold. We hypothesized that these screening changes could delay the diagnosis of advanced prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was used to identify men (age, 55-69 years) diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2004 to 2008 (group 1), 2009 to 2012 (group 2), and 2013 to 2015 (group 3). Groups reflect United States Preventive Services Task Force guideline changes. Descriptive statistics were used to present baseline statistics and the number of patients diagnosed in aforementioned groups. Data was adjusted for population growth.  Results:   A total of 328,586 men were identified (group 1, 135,625; group 2, 117,979; group 3, 74,982). The average number of men diagnosed annually with N1M0 (group 1, 381; group 2, 477; group 3, 660) and M1 (group 1, 523; group 2, 761; group 3, 1037) disease increased. With group 1 as control, there was a decrease in the incidence of localized disease (group 2, 9.2%; group 3, 33.2%). However, the incidence of N1M0 (group 2, 5.3%; group 3, 30.1%) and M1 disease (group 2, 22.6%; group 3, 49.2%) increased. Separate analyses of patients (age 50-75 years) and African Americans showed similar trends.  Conclusion:   With each recommendation, there was increased incidence of de novo metastatic prostate cancer. The sequelae of advanced disease include financial, emotional, and physical burden.

The results of SRB assays showed that GC inhibited the proliferation of PC3 cells with an IC50 value of 1.79 ± 0.28 μM. GC also induced G2/M cell cycle arrest which was accompanied by declining levels of cyclin proteins. Possible mechanisms were investigated and it was found that GC bound to Hsp90 and caused the degradation of Hsp90 client proteins (AKT, CHK1, P53, CDK4, Raf-b, and Raf-1). The fluorescent polarization assay with FITC-labeled geldanamycin (FITC-GA) demonstrated that GC was able to compete with FITC-GA in binding to wild type Hsp90 with an IC50 of 2.15 μM. Results of a docking study also suggested that GC interacted with the N-terminal domain of Hsp90. Our results showed that GC could bind to Hsp90, which resulted in down-regulation of Hsp90 client proteins and G2/M arrest in PC3 cells.

Here we describe patterns of recurrence and identify modes of progression after MDT using SABR.  Methods and materials:   Two hundred fifty-eight patients with castration-sensitive oligometastatic prostate cancer (≤5 lesions at staging) were retrospectively identified from a multi-institutional database. Descriptive patterns of recurrence and modes of progression were reported. Other outcomes including median time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence, time to next intervention, distant metastasis-free survival, overall survival, and biochemical PFS (bPFS) were reported. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and multivariable analysis was performed.  Results:   Median follow-up was 25.2 months, and 50.4% of patients received concurrent androgen deprivation. Median time to PSA recurrence was 15.7 months, time to next intervention was 28.6 months, distant metastasis-free survival was 19.1 months, and bPFS was 16.1 months. Two-year overall survival was 96.8%. On multivariable analysis, factors associated with bPFS included age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; P = .04), N1 disease at diagnosis (HR, 2.00; P = .02), M1 disease at diagnosis (HR, 0.44; P = .01), initial PSA at diagnosis (HR, 1.002; P = <.001), use of androgen deprivation therapy (HR, 0.41; P < .001), pre-SABR PSA (HR, 1.02; P = .01), and use of enhanced imaging for staging (HR, 2.81; P = .001). Patterns of progression favored an osseous component at recurrence; in patients initially treated to a bone lesion alone, the vast majority (86.5%) experienced a recurrence that included an osseous site. Patients treated initially to a nodal site alone tended to recur in a node only (64.5%); however, there was also a significant minority with an osseous component of recurrence at progression (32.3%). Modes of progressors were class I (patients with long term control [no recurrence ≥18 months after therapy]) occurring in 40.9%, class II (oligoprogressors [≤3 lesions at recurrence]) occurring in 36% (including 7.9% of patients with PSA recurrence but no metastatic disease), and class III (polyprogressors [>3 lesions]) occurring in 23.1% of patients.  Conclusions:   After MDT, the majority of patients have long-term control or oligoprogression (class I or II). Recurrence tended to occur in osseous sites.

Method:   Four MOSkin dosimeters were coupled to a TRUS probe during 20 TRUS-based HDR pBT treatment fractions. The measured MOSkin doses were retrospectively compared to those predicted by the BTPS for the total treatment fraction, as well as on a per catheter basis.  Results:   The average relative percentage difference between MOSkin measured and BTPS predicted doses for a total treatment fraction was 0.3% ± 11.6% (k = 1), with a maximum of 23.2% and a minimum of -29.0%. The average relative percentage difference per catheter was +2.5% ± 16.9% (k = 1). The majority (64%) of per catheter MOSkin measured doses agreed with the treatment planning system within the calculated uncertainty budget of 12.3%.  Conclusion:   The results of the study agreed well with previously published data, despite differences in clinical workflows. To improve the redundancy to potential dosimeter errors, a minimum of 4 MOSkin dosimeters should be used when performing real-time in-vivo rectal dosimetry for HDR pBT, and error thresholds should be based off the total combined uncertainty estimate of measurement.

On histopathological examination, no changes in GS were observed in 237 (53.9%) patients, whereas GS was upgraded in 144 (32.8%) patients and downgraded in 58 (13.2%) patients at radical prostatectomy. The number of patients who had extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion and positive lymph nodes was significantly higher in the upgraded group compared with the non-upgraded group. Conclusion: In this study, there was a steady decrease in GS upgrading with the prostate size extending up to 49.7 g. There was also an association between downgrading and extending prostate size. Due to the greater risk of high-grade disease in men with small prostates, smaller prostate bulks are most probably upgraded after radical prostatectomy. A higher maximum percentage of involvement per core was an independent predictive factor of upgrading from biopsy grade 1 to grade ≥ 2. Our study showed that patients' age was not predictive of upgrading, which is consistent with other studies. Also, we demonstrated a non-significant relationship between PSA level and upgraded GS. Findings in this study did not demonstrate a significant relationship between PSA level and upgrading.""","""['Amir Reza Abedi', 'Abbas Basiri', 'Nasser Shakhssalim', 'Ghazal Sadri', 'Mahsa Ahadi', 'Seyyed Ali Hojjati', 'Samad Sheykhzadeh', 'Sajjad Askarpour', 'Saleh Ghiasy']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Urol J""","""['Clinically predictive factors of Gleason score upgrading in patients after radical prostatectomy.', 'Clinical and pathologic predictors of Gleason sum upgrading in patients after radical prostatectomy: results from a single institution series.', 'Correlation of Preoperative and Radical Prostatectomy Gleason Score: Examining the Predictors of Upgrade and Downgrade Results.', 'Radical prostatectomy for impalpable prostate cancer: the Johns Hopkins experience with tumors found on transurethral resection (stages T1A and T1B) and on needle biopsy (stage T1C).', 'Clinical factors affecting prostate-specific antigen levels in prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy: a retrospective study.', 'Clinical Predictors of Grade Group Upgrading for Radical Prostatectomy Specimens Compared to Those of Preoperative Needle Biopsy Specimens.', 'CRMP4 CpG Hypermethylation Predicts Upgrading to Gleason Score ≥ 8 in Prostate Cancer.']"""

The current study analyzed disease-related quality of life (QoL) in patients undergoing PSMA therapy with a special focus on the association with simultaneous PSA response.  Methods:   Thirty patients (age range 50-87 years, median 73.5 years) undergoing 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy from 2014 to 2016 at our institution were included in this pilot study. Health-related QoL was assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire filled in at baseline and two months after initializing the PSMA-therapy. The treatment response was evaluated under three categories with regard to changes in (a) global health status and other functional scales, (b) disease-related symptoms, and (c) effects of PSA values.  Results:   Most patients underwent three treatment cycles (n = 12); at least 2 cycles (n = 6) or at most 8 cycles (n = 1) were performed. Out of 30 cases, PSA response after the first cycle was observed in 73 % (n = 22). Compared to baseline, QoL was significantly improved at 2-month follow-up revealing increase in global health status (p = 0.025), role functioning (p = 0.017) and emotional functioning (0.010), and decrease in pain (p = 0.033). Global health status variation can be explained up to 20.5 % by response in PSA (p = 0.012), this improved with PSA reduction.

Immobilization of monoclonal antibody specific to PSA (anti-PSA) was performed using 1-ethyl-3-dimethylaminopropylcarbodiimide hydrochloride and N-hydroxysuccinimide crosslinking agents in order to conjugate carboxylic (-COOH) terminated group of 16-Mercaptoundecanoic acid with amine (-NH3+) on anti-PSA epitope. This approach offers simple and efficient approach to form a strong, covalently bound thiol-gold (SAu) for a reliable SAM layer formation. Studies on the topographic of pristine Au-IDE surface were performed by Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy techniques, meanwhile a 3-dimensional optical surface profiler, Atomic Force Microscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy techniques were used to validate the successful functionalization steps on the sensor transducer surface. Detection of PSA in f-EIS mode was carried out by measuring the response in charge transfer resistance (Rct) and impedance change (Z), meanwhile in nf-EIS mode, the changes in device capacitance was monitored. In f-EIS mode, the sensor reveals a logarithmic detection of PSA in a range of 100 ng/ml down to 0.01 ng/ml in Phosphate Buffered Saline with a recorded sensitivity of 2.412 kΩ/log10 ([PSA] ng/ml) and the limit of detection (LOD) down to 0.01 ng/ml. The nf-EIS detection mode yields a logarithmic detection range of 5000 ng/ml down to 0.5 ng/ml, with a sensitivity of 8.570 nF/log10 ([PSA] ng/ml) and an LOD of 0.5 ng/ml.

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed prospectively recorded data of men undergoing FT for localized low- or intermediate-risk PCa with US- (Ablatherm®-2009 to 2014) or mpMRI-US (Focal One®-from 2014) guided HIFU. Follow-up visits and data were collected using internationally validated questionnaires at 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 months.  Results:   We included n=88 US-guided FT HIFU and n=52 mpMRI-US guided FT HIFU respectively. No major baseline differences were present except higher rates of Gleason 3+4 for the mpMRI-US group. No major differences were present in hospital stay (p=0.1), catheterization time (p=0.5) and complications (p=0.2) although these tended to be lower in the mpMRI-US group (6.8% versus 13.2% US FT group). At 3 months mpMRI-US guided HIFU had significantly lower urine leak (5.1% vs. 15.9%, p=0.04) and a lower drop in IIEF scores (2 vs. 4.2, p=0.07).

We hypothesized that robust and specific labeling of prostate cancer cells could be achieved in post-digital rectal examination (DRE) urine samples using RISH.  Methods:   We focused on method development, optimization, and analytical evaluation of RISH-based detection of prostate cancer in urine. We optimized a sample collection, processing, and target detection workflow for urine cytology specimens in conjunction with RNA target detection by RISH. We screened a panel of 11 prostate-specific RNA targets, and selected NKX3-1 and PRAC1 as markers for cells of prostate origin and PCA3 as a marker of prostate malignancy. Following analytical validation of a multiplexed NKX3-1/PRAC1/PCA3 assay, we evaluated whether prostate cancer cells can be detected in a pilot cohort of 19 post-DRE specimens obtained from men diagnosed with prostate cancer.  Results:   Using cytology specimens prepared from spiked urine samples, we established the analytical validity of the RISH assay for detection and visualization of prostate cells in urine. Cells of prostate origin could be readily and specifically identified and separated into benign and malignant cell populations based on the multiplex test that consisted of markers specific for prostate cells (NKX3-1, PRAC1) and prostate cancer cells (PCA3). Upon evaluation of post-DRE urine from a pilot cohort of prostate cancer patients, we identified 11 samples in which prostate cells were present, 6 of which were also positive for prostate cancer cells.  Conclusions:   Multiplex RISH enables the direct visualization and molecular characterization of individual exfoliated prostate cells in urine.

AR plays a vital role in the progression of prostate cancer and is a crucial target for therapeutic interventions. While the majority of advanced-stage prostate cancer patients will initially respond to the androgen deprivation, the disease often progresses to castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Interestingly, CRPC tumors continue to depend on hyperactive AR signaling and will respond to potent second-line antiandrogen therapies, including bicalutamide (CASODEX®) and enzalutamide (XTANDI®). However, the progression-free survival rate for the CRPC patients on antiandrogen therapies is only 8-19 months. Hence, there is a need to understand the mechanisms underlying CRPC progression and eventual treatment resistance. Here, we have leveraged next-generation sequencing and newly developed analytical methodologies to evaluate the role of AR signaling in regulating the transcriptome of prostate cancer cells. The genomic and pharmacologic stimulation and inhibition of AR activity demonstrates that AR regulates alternative splicing within cancer-relevant genes. Furthermore, by integrating transcriptomic data from in vitro experiments and in prostate cancer patients, we found that a significant number of AR-regulated splicing events are associated with tumor progression. For example, we found evidence for an inadvertent AR-antagonist-mediated switch in IDH1 and PL2G2A isoform expression, which is associated with a decrease in overall survival of patients. Mechanistically, we discovered that the epithelial-specific splicing regulators (ESRP1 and ESRP2), flank many AR-regulated alternatively spliced exons. And, using 2D invasion assays, we show that the inhibition of ESRPs can suppress AR-antagonist-driven tumor invasion. Our work provides evidence for a new mechanism by which AR alters the transcriptome of prostate cancer cells by modulating alternative splicing. As such, our work has important implications for CRPC progression and development of resistance to treatment with bicalutamide and enzalutamide.""","""['Kalpit Shah', 'Teresa Gagliano#', 'Lisa Garland#', ""Timothy O'Hanlon"", 'Daria Bortolotti', 'Valentina Gentili', 'Roberta Rizzo', 'Georgios Giamas', 'Michael Dean']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['NDRG2 acts as a negative regulator downstream of androgen receptor and inhibits the growth of androgen-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Dual targeting of the androgen receptor and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α pathways synergistically inhibits castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'FOXA1 regulates androgen receptor variant activity in models of castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Understanding the mechanisms of androgen deprivation resistance in prostate cancer at the molecular level.', 'Molecular Similarities and Differences between Canine Prostate Cancer and Human Prostate Cancer Variants.', 'Preclinical models of prostate cancer - modelling androgen dependency and castration resistance in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo.', 'Risk Allele Frequency Analysis and Risk Prediction of Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms for Prostate Cancer.', 'Investigation of androgen receptor-dependent alternative splicing has identified a unique subtype of lethal prostate cancer.', 'FOXA1 regulates alternative splicing in prostate cancer.']"""

This study investigated a) racial differences in SCNAs in both breast and prostate cancer, b) the degree to which they are shared across cancers, and c) the impact of these shared, race-differentiated SCNAs on cancer survival.  Methods:   Utilizing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), SCNAs were identified using GISTIC 2.0, and in each tumor type, differences in SCNA magnitude between African Americans (AA) and European Americans (EA) were tested using linear regression. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the copy number of genes residing in race-differentiated SCNAs shared between tumor types was used to identify SCNA-defined patient groups, and Cox proportional hazards regression was used to test for association between those groups and overall/progression-free survival (PFS).  Results:   We identified SCNAs that differed by race in breast (n = 58 SCNAs; permutation p < 10- 4) and prostate tumors (n = 78 SCNAs; permutation p = 0.006). Six race-differentiated SCNAs common to breast and prostate found at chromosomes 5q11.2-q14.1, 5q15-q21.1, 8q21.11-q21.13, 8q21.3-q24.3, 11q22.3, and 13q12.3-q21.3 had consistent differences by race across both tumor types, and all six were of higher magnitude in AAs, with the chromosome 8q regions being the only amplifications.

Race differentiated SCNA-defined patient groups were significantly associated with survival differences in both cancer types, and these groups also differentiated within triple negative breast cancers based on PFS. While the frequency of the SCNA-defined patient groups differed by race, their effects on survival did not.  Conclusions:   This study identified race-differentiated SCNAs shared by two related cancers.

However, systemic evaluation of cadmium exposure for the transformation of prostatic hyperplasia into prostate cancer (PCa) is still unclear. In the present study, an attempt has been made to establish cadmium-induced human prostate carcinogenesis using an in vitro model of BPH cells. Wide range of cadmium concentrations, i.e., 1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM and 1μM, were chronically exposed to the human BPH cells for transformation into PCa and monitored using cell and molecular biology approaches. After eight weeks of exposure, the cells showed subtle morphological changes and shifts of cell cycle in the G2M phase. Significant increase in expression of prostatic genes AR, PSA, ER-β, and 5αR with increased nuclear localization of AR and pluripotency markers Cmyc, Klf4 indicated the carcinogenic effect of Cd. Further, the BPH cells exposed to Cd showed a substantial increase in the secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9, influencing migratory potential of the cells along with decreased expression of the p63 protein which further strengthen the progression towards carcinogenesis and aggressive tumor studies. Data from the present study state that Cd exhibited marked invasiveness in BPH cells. These observations established a connecting link of BPH towards PCa pathogenesis.

In this study, we evaluated the preclinical efficacy of a third-generation AR antagonist, enzalutamide, in a genetic mouse model of EMC, Sprr2f-Cre;Ptenfl/fl. In this model, ablation of Pten in the uterine epithelium leads to localized and distant malignant disease as observed in human EMC. We hypothesized that administering enzalutamide through the diet would temporarily decrease the incidence of invasive and metastatic carcinoma, while prolonged administration would result in development of resistance and loss of efficacy. Short-term treatment with enzalutamide reduced overall tumor burden through increased apoptosis but failed to prevent progression of invasive and metastatic disease. These results suggest that AR signaling may have biphasic, oncogenic and tumor suppressive roles in EMC that are dependent on disease stage. Enzalutamide treatment increased Progesterone Receptor (PR) expression within both stromal and tumor cell compartments. Prolonged administration of enzalutamide decreased apoptosis, increased tumor burden and resulted in the clonal expansion of tumor cells expressing high levels of p53 protein, suggestive of acquired Trp53 mutations.

A commonly accepted methodological approach for detecting Rac1 activation in cancer cells involves the use of a conformation-sensitive antibody that detects the active (GTP-bound) Rac1 without interacting with the GDP-bound inactive form. This antibody has been extensively used in fixed cell immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry. Taking advantage of prostate and pancreatic cancer cell models known to have high basal Rac1-GTP levels, here we have established that this antibody does not recognize Rac1 but rather detects the intermediate filament protein vimentin. Indeed, Rac1-null PC3 prostate cancer cells or cancer models with low levels of Rac1 activation still show a high signal with the anti-Rac1-GTP antibody, which is lost upon silencing of vimentin expression. Moreover, this antibody was unable to detect activated Rac1 in membrane ruffles induced by epidermal growth factor stimulation. These results have profound implications for the study of this key GTPase in cancer, particularly because a large number of cancer cell lines with characteristic mesenchymal features show simultaneous up-regulation of vimentin and high basal Rac1-GTP levels when measured biochemically.

We sought to develop a biomarker of CIN in circulating tumor cells (CTC) that are more likely to reflect the genetic diversity of patient's disease than a single-site biopsy and be assessed rapidly so as to inform treatment management decisions in real time. Large-scale transitions (LST) are genomic alterations defined as chromosomal breakages that generate chromosomal gains or losses of greater than or equal to10 Mb.

This relationship was then used to develop a computer vision algorithm that utilizes CTC image features to predict the presence of a high (9 or more) versus low (8 or fewer) LST number in a single cell. As LSTs are a primary functional component of homologous recombination deficient cellular phenotypes, the image-based algorithm was studied prospectively on 10,240 CTCs in 367 blood samples obtained from 294 patients with progressing metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer taken prior to starting a standard-of-care approved therapy.

Plasma glycan-binding IgG/IgM studies suggested that glycan patterns differ between normal and tumor cells. We hypothesize that in prostate cancer glycoproteins or glycolipids are secreted from tumor tissues into the blood and induce auto-immunoglobulin (Ig) production. A 24-glycan microarray and a 5-glycan subarray were developed using plasma samples obtained from 35 prostate cancer patients and 54 healthy subjects to identify glycan-binding auto-IgGs. Neu5Acα2-8Neu5Acα2-8Neu5Acα (G81)-binding auto-IgG was higher in prostate cancer samples and, when levels of G81-binding auto-IgG and growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15 or NAG-1) were combined with levels of PSA, the prediction rate of prostate cancer increased from 78.2% to 86.2% than with PSA levels alone. The G81 glycan-binding auto-IgG fraction was isolated from plasma samples using G81 glycan-affinity chromatography and identified by N-terminal sequencing of the 50 kDa heavy chain variable region of the IgG.

Objective:   To compare the long-term outcomes of transoral robotic surgery with those of nonrobotic surgery for patients with early-stage oropharyngeal cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   A retrospective cohort comparative effectiveness analysis was performed of patients in the National Cancer Database with clinical T1 and T2 oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma diagnosed between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2015, who underwent definitive robotic and nonrobotic surgery. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and propensity score matching were performed in patients with known human papillomavirus status to adjust for patient- and disease-related covariates. Survival after robotic and nonrobotic surgery was also compared in 3 unrelated cancers: prostate, endometrial, and cervical cancer. Statistical analysis was performed from April 10, 2019, to May 21, 2020.  Main outcomes and measures:   Overall survival.  Results:   Of 9745 patients (7652 men [78.5%]; mean [SD] age, 58.8 [9.6] years) who met inclusion criteria, 2694 (27.6%) underwent transoral robotic surgery. There was a significant increase in the use of robotic surgery from 18.3% (240 of 1309) to 35.5% (654 of 1841) of all surgical procedures for T1 and T2 oropharyngeal cancers from 2010 to 2015 (P = .003). Robotic surgery was associated with lower rates of positive surgical margins (12.5% [218 of 1746] vs 20.3% [471 of 2325]; P < .001) and lower use of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (28.6% [500 of 1746] vs 35.7% [831 of 2325]; P < .001). Among 4071 patients with known human papillomavirus status, robotic surgery was associated with improved overall survival compared with nonrobotic surgery in multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression (hazard ratio [HR], 0.74; 95 CI, 0.61-0.90; P = .002). Similar results were seen when analyzing only the subset of facilities offering both robotic and nonrobotic surgery. The 5-year overall survival was 84.8% vs 80.3% among patients undergoing robotic vs nonrobotic surgery in propensity score-matched cohorts (P = .001). By contrast, there was no evidence that robotic surgery was associated with improved survival in other cancers, such as prostate cancer (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.79-1.07; P = .26), endometrial cancer (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.90-1.04; P = .36), and cervical cancer (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.96-1.69; P = .10).

NADPH oxidases (NOXs) and six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate enzymes (STEAPs) are iconic members of the superfamily. NOXs produce extracellular reactive oxygen species that exert potent bactericidal activities and trigger redox-signaling cascades that regulate cell division and differentiation. STEAPs catalyze the reduction of extracellular iron and copper which is necessary for the bioavailability of these essential elements. Both NOXs and STEAPs are present as multiple isozymes with distinct regulatory properties and physiological roles. Despite the important roles of NOXs and STEAPs in human physiology and despite their wide involvement in diseases like cancer, their mode of action at the molecular level remained incompletely understood for a long time, in part due to the absence of high-resolution models of the complete enzymes. Our two laboratories have elucidated the three-dimensional structures of NOXs and STEAPs, providing key insight into their mechanisms and evolution. The enzymes share a conserved transmembrane helical domain with an eye-catching hourglass shape. On the extracellular side, a heme prosthetic group is at the bottom of a pocket where the substrate (O2 in NOX, chelated iron or copper in STEAP) is reduced. On the intracellular side, the inner heme of NOX and the FAD of STEAP are bound to topological equivalent sites. This is a rare case where critical amino acid substitutions and local conformational changes enable a cofactor (heme vs FAD) swap between two structurally and functionally conserved scaffolds. The catalytic core of these enzymes is completed by distinct cytosolic NADPH-binding domains that are topologically unrelated (a ferredoxin reductase-like flavoprotein domain in NOX and a F420H2:NADP+-like domain in STEAP), feature different quaternary structures, and underlie specific regulatory mechanisms. Despite their differences, these domains all establish electron-transfer chains that direct the electrons from NADPH to the transmembrane domain. The multistep nature of the process and the chemical nature of the products pose considerable problems in the enzymatic assays. We learned that great care must be exerted in the validation of a candidate inhibitor. Multiple orthogonal assays are required to rule out off-target effects such as ROS-scavenging activities or nonspecific interference with the enzyme redox chain. The structural analysis of STEAP/NOX enzymes led us to further notice that their transmembrane heme-binding topology is shared by other enzymes. We found that the core domain of the cytochrome b subunits of the mitochondrial complex III and photosynthetic cytochrome b6f are closely related to NOXs and STEAPs and likely arose from the same ancestor protein. This observation expands the substrate portfolio of the superfamily since cytochromes b act on ubiquinone. The rigidly packed helices of the NOX/STEAP/cytochrome b domain contrast with the more malleable membrane proteins like ion channels or amino-acid transporters, which undergo large conformational changes to allow passage of relatively large metabolites. This notion of a rigid hourglass scaffold found an unexpected confirmation in the observation, revealed by structural comparisons, that an helical bundle identical to the NOX/STEAP/cytochrome b enzymes is featured by a de novo designed heme-binding protein, PS1. Apparently, nature and protein designers have independently converged to this fold as a versatile scaffold for heme-mediated reactions. The challenge is now to uncover the molecular mechanisms that implement the isozyme-specific regulation of the enzyme functions and develop much needed inhibitors and modulators for chemical biology and drug design studies.""","""['Wout Oosterheert', 'Joana Reis', 'Piet Gros', 'Andrea Mattevi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Acc Chem Res""","""['Cryo-EM structures of human STEAP4 reveal mechanism of iron(III) reduction.', 'Structure and mechanisms of ROS generation by NADPH oxidases.', 'High-resolution studies of hydride transfer in the ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase superfamily.', 'Characterization of a single b-type heme, FAD, and metal binding sites in the transmembrane domain of six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate (STEAP) family proteins.', 'Regulatory Roles of Six-Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate Family Members in the Occurrence and Development of Malignant Tumors.', 'Overview of Cancer Metabolism and Signaling Transduction.', 'Structure of the core human NADPH oxidase NOX2.', 'STEAP1-4 (Six-Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate 1-4) and Their Clinical Implications for Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods Prostate needle biopsy samples of 115 patients with available pre-treatment serum total PSA (tPSA) level were analysed. For all cases where morphology alone was insufficient, immunohistochemistry was performed using p63, CKHMW and AMACR antibody panel in order to confirm or exclude the existence of prostate carcinoma. Results Statistically significant positive correlation between serum total PSA values and prevalence of finding prostate carcinoma in needle biopsy specimens was found (p=0.011), as well as in the case when the patients were classified into groups according to tPSA levels (p=0.028). Serum total PSA values and levels (level groups) showed significant positive correlation with Gleason score (p=0.029 and p=0.036, respectively) and Grade Group of prostate carcinomas (p=0.044 and p=0.046, respectively). Sensitivity of the screening test by using 4 ng/mL as cut off value for tPSA was 94.12% (CI: 80.32-99.28%), specificity 8.64% (CI: 3.55-17.00%), positive predictive value 30.19% (CI: 21.65-39.87%) and negative predictive value 77.78% (CI: 39.99-97.19%). Conclusion The increase of serum tPSA value increases the likelihood of finding prostate cancer on needle biopsy specimens. Due to such findings and its positive correlation with a grade of prostate cancer, our study indicates that tPSA can still be considered as a useful tool both in detecting and predicting aggressiveness of prostate cancer.""","""['Nina Čamdžić', 'Suada Kuskunović-Vlahovljak', 'Mirsad Dorić', 'Svjetlana Radović', 'Edina Lazović Salčin', 'Mirsad Babić']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Glas (Zenica)""","""['Complexed prostate-specific antigen for early detection of prostate cancer in men with serum prostate-specific antigen levels of 2 to 4 nanograms per milliliter.', 'Association of Gleason score with PSA Values and Serum Testosterone Levels Measured Prior To Prostate Biopsy.', 'Mass screening of prostate cancer in a Chinese population: the relationship between pathological features of prostate cancer and serum prostate specific antigen.', 'Nonpalpable stage T1c prostate cancer: prediction of insignificant disease using free/total prostate specific antigen levels and needle biopsy findings.', 'Use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) isoforms for the detection of prostate cancer in men with a PSA level of 2-10 ng/ml: systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Our objectives were to investigate inter-observer variability of percent Gleason pattern and CR/IDC and to relate individual tumour scores to clinical outcome. Our cohort included 80 consecutive radical prostatectomies with a median follow-up 87.1 months (interquartile range 43.3-119.2), of which the slide with largest tumour volume was scored by six pathologists for Grade group (four tiers: 1, 2, 3 and 4/5), percent Gleason pattern 4 (four tiers: 0-25%, 26-50%, 51-75% and 76-100%) and presence of CR/IDC (two tiers: absent, present). The individual assignments were related to post-operative biochemical recurrence (20/80). Inter-observer agreement was substantial (Krippendorff's α 0.626) for assessment of Grade group and moderate for CR/IDC (α 0.507) and percent Gleason pattern 4 (α 0.551). For each individual pathologist, biochemical recurrence rates incremented by Grade group and presence of CR/IDC, although such relation was less clear for percent Gleason pattern 4. In conclusion, inter-observer agreement for CR/IDC and percent Gleason pattern 4 is lower than for Grade groups, indicating awareness of these features needs further improvement.

Methods:   A retrospective study was conducted of bone metastases-predominant mCRPC patients treated with radium-223. Treatment patterns from 2013 to 2018 were evaluated in patients treated with radium-223 pre- vs. post-chemotherapy. OS was examined using Kaplan-Meier medians and 95% confidence intervals.  Results:   In total, 220 patients were treated with radium-223 (64 pre-chemotherapy, 83 post-chemotherapy, 73 no chemotherapy). Mean radium-223 injections per patient was 5.3 and 4.3 in the pre- vs. post-chemotherapy cohorts, respectively (p < 0.001). The number of chemotherapy cycles was similar for chemotherapy given pre- or post-radium-223. Mean line of mCRPC therapy of radium-223 was 3rd and 5th when given pre- and post-chemotherapy, respectively (p < 0.001). 41.8% patients were treated with radium-223 in combination with another mCRPC therapy, commonly abiraterone acetate (43.5%) or enzalutamide (52.2%). The majority received combination therapy for the duration of radium-223 treatment; 20.7% started another agent after radium-223 initiation; 20.7% initiated radium-223 while on established therapy.

Pre-salvage PSA was a common predictor for the measured oncological outcomes.  Conclusions:   Although sHIFU had higher BCR and CRPC rates, there were no differences in PCSM when compared with sCT.

Genetic and chemical inhibition of DOT1L selectively impaired the viability of androgen receptor (AR)-positive PCa cells and organoids, including castration-resistant and enzalutamide-resistant cells. The sensitivity of AR-positive cells is due to a distal K79 methylation-marked enhancer in the MYC gene bound by AR and DOT1L not present in AR-negative cells. DOT1L inhibition leads to reduced MYC expression and upregulation of MYC-regulated E3 ubiquitin ligases HECTD4 and MYCBP2, which promote AR and MYC degradation.

We previously reported that expression of disialosyl globopentaosyl ceramide (DSGb5), one of carbohydrate antigens, in radical prostatectomy specimens independently predicted biochemical recurrence (i.e., elevating serum prostate specific antigen without recurrent lesions in the image) after radical prostatectomy. However, it is important to evaluate the prognosis at the diagnosis. In this study we investigated DSGb5 expression in prostate biopsy specimens to develop a novel biomarker for providing appropriate management. Between 2005 and 2011, patients who underwent both prostate biopsy and radical prostatectomy in our institution were included. The median follow-up period was 88 months. DSGb5 expression was assessed by immunohistochemical staining and defined 116 patients as high DSGb5 expression (42 patients) or low DSGb5 expression (74 patients). High DSGb5 expression was significantly associated with lymphovascular invasion in radical prostatectomy specimens on both univariate and multivariable analyses (p = 0.028, 0.027). On multivariable analysis, Gleason Score in prostatectomy specimen, positive resection margin, and DSGb5 expression in the biopsy specimen were independently associated with biochemical recurrence-free survival following radical prostatectomy (p = 0.004, 0.008, 0.024). When targeting only patients with negative resection margin, DSGb5 expression was significantly associated with biochemical recurrence-free survival on both univariate and multivariable analyses (p = 0.006, 0.007).

The recently updated Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2.1 includes a change in the recommended measurement method for PGV compared to version 2.0. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the agreement of MRI-based PGV calculations with the volumetric manual slice-by-slice prostate segmentation as a reference standard using the linear measurements per PI-RADS versions 2.0 and 2.1. Furthermore, to assess inter-reader agreement for the different measurement approaches, determine the influence of an enlarged transition zone on measurement accuracy and to assess the value of the bullet formula for PGV calculation.  Materials and methods:   Ninety-five consecutive treatment-naive patients undergoing prostate MRI were retrospectively analyzed. Prostates were manually contoured and segmented on axial T2-weighted images. Four different radiologists independently measured the prostate in three dimensions according to PI-RADS v2.0 and v2.1, respectively. MRI-based PGV was calculated using the ellipsoid and bullet formulas. Calculated volumes were compared to the reference manual segmentations using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Inter-reader agreement was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).  Results:   Inter-reader agreement was excellent for the ellipsoid and bullet formulas using PI-RADS v2.0 (ICC 0.985 and 0.987) and v2.1 (ICC 0.990 and 0.994), respectively. The median difference from the reference standard using the ellipsoid formula derived PGV was 0.4 mL (interquartile range, -3.9 to 5.1 mL) for PI-RADS v2.0 (p = 0.393) and 2.6 mL (interquartile range, -1.6 to 7.3 mL) for v2.1 (p < 0.001) with a median difference of 2.2 mL. The bullet formula overestimated PGV by a median of 13.3 mL using PI-RADS v2.0 (p < 0.001) and 16.0 mL using v2.1 (p < 0.001). In the presence of an enlarged transition zone the PGV tended to be higher than the reference standard for PI-RADS v2.0 (median difference of 4.7 mL; p = 0.018) and for v2.1 (median difference of 5.7 mL, p < 0.001) using the ellipsoid formula.  Conclusion:   Inter-reader agreement was excellent for the calculated PGV for both methods. PI-RADS v2.0 measurements with the ellipsoid formula yielded the most accurate volume estimates. The differences between PI-RADS v2.0 and v2.1 were statistically significant although small in absolute numbers but may be of relevance in specific clinical scenarios like prostate-specific antigen density calculation. These findings validate the use of the ellipsoid formula and highlight that the bullet formula should not be used for prostate volume estimation due to systematic overestimation.""","""['Soleen Ghafoor', 'Anton S Becker', 'Sungmin Woo', 'Pamela I Causa Andrieu', 'Daniel Stocker', 'Natalie Gangai', 'Hedvig Hricak', 'Hebert Alberto Vargas']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Acad Radiol""","""['Accurate Prostate Volumes from Manual Calculations-A Comparison of PI-RADS v2 and v2.1 Measurement Techniques.', 'Evaluation of prostate volume in mpMRI: comparison of the recommendations of PI-RADS v2 and PI-RADS v2.1.', 'Comparison of PI-RADS version 2 and PI-RADS version 2.1 for the detection of transition zone prostate cancer.', 'PI-RADS Versions 2 and 2.1: Interobserver Agreement and Diagnostic Performance in Peripheral and Transition Zone Lesions Among Six Radiologists.', 'Interobserver Agreement and Accuracy in Interpreting mpMRI of the Prostate: a Systematic Review.', 'Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2.1: 2019 Update of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2.', 'Prostate gland volume estimation: anteroposterior diameters measured on axial versus sagittal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance images.', 'Deep learning algorithm performs similarly to radiologists in the assessment of prostate volume on MRI.', 'Evaluation of transabdominal and transperineal ultrasound-derived prostate specific antigen (PSA) density and clinical utility compared to MRI prostate volumes: A feasibility study.', 'Comparison of different thresholds of PSA density for risk stratification of PI-RADSv2.1 categories on prostate MRI.', 'PI-RADS\xa02.1 and structured reporting of magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate.']"""

Objective:   To investigate prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values in men presenting for primary couple's infertility compared with a cohort of fertile individuals, according to the recommendation of the European Association of Urology guidelines that a first PSA assessment should be done at 40-45 yr of age.  Design, setting, and participants:   This is a cross-sectional study. Data from 956 (90%) infertile men and 102 (9.6%) fertile participants were analysed. Circulating hormones, total PSA, and semen parameters were investigated in every man.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Descriptive statistics, local polynomial smoothing, and linear regression models were used to test potential associations with PSA levels.  Results and limitations:   Overall, PSA >1 ng/ml was found in 318 (30%) men. Serum PSA was higher (p = 0.02), while serum testosterone (p < 0.01) was lower in infertile than in fertile men. In participants younger than 40 yr, 176 (27%) men had PSA >1 ng/ml; of them, a greater proportion were infertile (28% infertile vs 17% fertile, p = 0.03). At multivariable linear regression analysis, infertile status (coefficient 0.21; 95% confidence interval 0.02-0.39) was associated with higher PSA values, after adjusting for age and serum testosterone level. This was a single-centre study, raising the possibility of selection biases.  Conclusions:   Infertile men have higher PSA values than fertile individuals. Of all, almost one out of three primary infertile men younger than 40 yr has a first total PSA value of >1 ng/ml.  Patient summary:   In this study, we observed that (1) infertile men have higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values than fertile individuals and (2) a greater proportion of infertile men younger than 40 yr had total PSA >1 ng/ml at the first assessment.

Patients with neurogenic bladder, prostate cancer, or urethral stricture were excluded from the analysis. Patients underwent either monopolar/bipolar transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP), prostate artery embolization (PAE), open prostatectomy (OP), or endoscopic enucleation. The primary endpoint was 12-month urinary catheter-free survival without using benign prostatic hyperplasia medications. Results: One hundred seventy-one consecutive men (median age: 71 years; median prostate volume: 75 cm3) underwent BPO surgery, including 48 (28%) TURP, 62 (36.3%) PVP, 21 (12.3%) endoscopic enucleation, 15 (8.8%) PAE, and 25 (14.6%) OP.

We found that AgIV significantly decreased the half-maximal inhibitory concentration of carboplatin in prostate cancer cell lines LNCap and PC-3. Moreover, AgIV enhanced the effect of carboplatin in suppressing colony formation and inducing cell apoptosis. A low-dose carboplatin treatment upregulated N-cadherin and Vimentin expression and downregulated E-cadherin expression, but this effect was abolished by combining with AgIV. Carboplatin treatment increased the levels of p-AKT and p-p65 and decreased p-IκBα, but AgIV treatment suppressed this. In addition, AgIV synergized with carboplatin to suppress tumor xenograft growth of PC-3 cells, and decreased pAKT and p-p65 levels in vivo.

Methods:   Using a micro-simulation analysis (MISCAN) model, we assessed the harms, benefits, and cost-effectiveness of 230 prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening strategies in a Dutch population. Screening strategies were varied by screening start age (50, 51, 52, 53, 54, and 55), stop age (51-69), and intervals (1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and single test). Costs and effects of each screening strategy were compared with a no-screening scenario.  Results:   The most optimum strategy would be screening with 3-year intervals at ages 55-64 resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €19 733 per QALY. This strategy predicted a 27% prostate cancer mortality reduction and 28 life years gained (LYG) per 1000 men; 36% of screen-detected men were overdiagnosed.

Methods:   Clinical variables and cancer outcomes were assessed annually among incident SLE patients. Multivariate hazard regression models (overall risk and most common cancers) included demographic characteristics and time-dependent medications (corticosteroids, antimalarial drugs, immunosuppressants), smoking, and the adjusted mean Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 score.  Results:   Among 1,668 patients (average 9 years follow-up), 65 cancers occurred: 15 breast, 10 nonmelanoma skin, 7 lung, 6 hematologic, 6 prostate, 5 melanoma, 3 cervical, 3 renal, 2 each gastric, head and neck, and thyroid, and 1 each rectal, sarcoma, thymoma, and uterine cancers. Half of the cancers (including all lung cancers) occurred in past/current smokers, versus one-third of patients without cancer. Multivariate analyses indicated that overall cancer risk was related primarily to male sex and older age at SLE diagnosis. In addition, smoking was associated with lung cancer. For breast cancer risk, age was positively associated and antimalarial drugs were negatively associated. Antimalarial drugs and higher disease activity were also negatively associated with nonmelanoma skin cancer risk, whereas age and cyclophosphamide were positively associated. Disease activity was associated positively with hematologic and negatively with nonmelanoma skin cancer risk.  Conclusion:   Smoking is a key modifiable risk factor, especially for lung cancer, in SLE. Immunosuppressive medications were not clearly associated with higher risk except for cyclophosphamide and nonmelanoma skin cancer. Antimalarials were negatively associated with breast cancer and nonmelanoma skin cancer risk. SLE activity was associated positively with hematologic cancer and negatively with nonmelanoma skin cancer. Since the absolute number of cancers was small, additional follow-up will help consolidate these findings.""","""['Sasha Bernatsky', 'Rosalind Ramsey-Goldman', 'Murray B Urowitz', 'John G Hanly', 'Caroline Gordon', 'Michelle A Petri', 'Ellen M Ginzler', 'Daniel J Wallace', 'Sang-Cheol Bae', 'Juanita Romero-Diaz', 'Mary Anne Dooley', 'Christine A Peschken', 'David A Isenberg', 'Anisur Rahman', 'Susan Manzi', 'Søren Jacobsen', 'S Sam Lim', 'Ronald van Vollenhoven', 'Ola Nived', 'Diane L Kamen', 'Cynthia Aranow', 'Guillermo Ruiz-Irastorza', 'Jorge Sánchez-Guerrero', 'Dafna D Gladman', 'Paul R Fortin', 'Graciela S Alarcón', 'Joan T Merrill', 'Kenneth C Kalunian', 'Manuel Ramos-Casals', 'Kristjan Steinsson', 'Asad Zoma', 'Anca Askanase', 'Munther A Khamashta', 'Ian Bruce', 'Murat Inanc', 'Ann E Clarke']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Arthritis Care Res (Hoboken)""","""['Lymphoma risk in systemic lupus: effects of disease activity versus treatment.', 'Smoking Is the Most Significant Modifiable Lung Cancer Risk Factor in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.', 'Treatment pathways in an inception lupus cohort over the first three years.', 'Exploring the links between systemic lupus erythematosus and cancer.', 'Factors mediating cancer risk in systemic lupus erythematosus.', 'Researchers in rheumatology should avoid categorization of continuous predictor variables.', 'Benzoapyrene Exposure Reduces Cell-Type Diversity and Stimulates Sex-Biased Damage Pathways in End Organs of Lupus-Prone Mice.', 'Malignancies in systemic rheumatic diseases: A mini review.', 'Malignancies among newly diagnosed systemic lupus erythematosus patients and their survival.', 'Antimalarials may reduce cancer risk in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies.']"""

Here, we describe cell-internalization SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment), a sophisticated technique based on RNA aptamers as a starting point, that enables design functional aptamers as drug-delivery tools. This variation of the original SELEX technique using RNA aptamers instead DNA aptamers allows to obtain aptamers that are internalized in prostate cancer cells using as a starting point an RNA aptamer library with 76 nucleotides.

Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) is increasingly used for prostate cancer evaluation. Prostate organ segmentation is an essential step of surgical planning for prostate fusion biopsies. Deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the predominant method of machine learning for medical image recognition. In this study, we describe a deep learning approach, a subset of artificial intelligence, for automatic localization and segmentation of prostates from mpMRI.  Materials and methods:   This retrospective study included patients who underwent prostate MRI and ultrasound-MRI fusion transrectal biopsy between September 2014 and December 2016. Axial T2-weighted images were manually segmented by two abdominal radiologists, which served as ground truth. These manually segmented images were used for training on a customized hybrid 3D-2D U-Net CNN architecture in a fivefold cross-validation paradigm for neural network training and validation. The Dice score, a measure of overlap between manually segmented and automatically derived segmentations, and Pearson linear correlation coefficient of prostate volume were used for statistical evaluation.  Results:   The CNN was trained on 299 MRI examinations (total number of MR images = 7774) of 287 patients. The customized hybrid 3D-2D U-Net had a mean Dice score of 0.898 (range, 0.890-0.908) and a Pearson correlation coefficient for prostate volume of 0.974.  Conclusion:   A deep learning CNN can automatically segment the prostate organ from clinical MR images.

CSCs are involved in tumor initiation and progression and contribute to treatment failure through their intrinsic resistance to chemo- or radiotherapy, thus representing a substantial concern for cancer treatment. Prostate CSCs' activity has been shown to be regulated by the transcription factor Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3). Here we investigated the effect of galiellalactone (GL), a direct STAT3 inhibitor, on CSCs derived from prostate cancer patients, on docetaxel-resistant spheres with stem cell characteristics, on CSCs obtained from the DU145 cell line in vitro and on DU145 tumors in vivo. We found that GL significantly reduced the viability of docetaxel-resistant and patient-derived spheres. Moreover, CSCs isolated from DU145 cells were sensitive to low concentrations of GL, and the treatment with GL suppressed their viability and their ability to form colonies and spheres. STAT3 inhibition down regulated transcriptional targets of STAT3 in these cells, indicating STAT3 activity in CSCs. Our results indicate that GL can target the prostate stem cell niche in patient-derived cells, in docetaxel-resistant spheres and in an in vitro model. We conclude that GL represents a promising therapeutic approach for prostate cancer patients, as it reduces the viability of prostate cancer-therapy-resistant cells in both CSCs and non-CSC populations.""","""['Giacomo Canesin', 'Valentina Maggio', 'Macarena Palominos', 'Anna Stiehm', 'Hector R Contreras', 'Enrique A Castellón', 'Juan Morote', 'Rosanna Paciucci', 'Norman J Maitland', 'Anders Bjartell', 'Rebecka Hellsten']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['The STAT3 Inhibitor Galiellalactone Effectively Reduces Tumor Growth and Metastatic Spread in an Orthotopic Xenograft Mouse Model of Prostate Cancer.', 'Galiellalactone is a direct inhibitor of the transcription factor STAT3 in prostate cancer cells.', 'EC-70124, a Novel Glycosylated Indolocarbazole Multikinase Inhibitor, Reverts Tumorigenic and Stem Cell Properties in Prostate Cancer by Inhibiting STAT3 and NF-κB.', 'STAT3 signaling in prostate cancer progression and therapy resistance: An oncogenic pathway with diverse functions.', 'Targeting prostate cancer stem cells for cancer therapy.', 'Repurposing ketotifen as a therapeutic strategy for neuroendocrine prostate cancer by targeting the IL-6/STAT3 pathway.', 'State-of-the-art therapeutic strategies for targeting cancer stem cells in prostate cancer.', 'STAT3 promotes RNA polymerase III-directed transcription by controlling the miR-106a-5p/TP73 axis.', 'Targeting aldehyde dehydrogenase for prostate cancer therapies.', ""STAT3 and Its Pathways' Dysregulation-Underestimated Role in Urological Tumors.""]"""

In a prior analysis, the trial's primary endpoint (overall survival [OS]) was not improved significantly.  Objective:   To report the final analysis of OS.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 799 patients were randomized to receive a single dose of radiotherapy to one or more bone metastases followed by either Ipilimumab (n = 399) or placebo (n = 400).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   OS was analyzed in the intention-to-treat population. Prespecified and exploratory subset analyses based on Kaplan-Meier/Cox methodology were performed.  Results and limitations:   During an additional follow-up of approximately 2.4 yr since the primary analysis, 721/799 patients have died. Survival analysis showed crossing of the curves at 7-8 mo, followed by persistent separation of the curves beyond that point, favoring the ipilimumab arm. Given the lack of proportional hazards, a piecewise hazard model showed that the hazard ratio (HR) changed over time: the HR was 1.49 (95% confidence interval 1.12, 1.99) for 0-5 mo, 0.66 (0.51, 0.86) for 5-12 mo, and 0.66 (0.52, 0.84) beyond 12 mo. OS rates were higher in the ipilimumab versus placebo arms at 2 yr (25.2% vs 16.6%), 3 yr (15.3% vs 7.9%), 4 yr (10.1% vs 3.3%), and 5 yr (7.9% vs. 2.7%). Disease progression was the most frequent cause of death in both arms. In seven patients (1.8%) in the ipilimumab arm and one (0.3%) in the placebo arm, the primary cause of death was reported as study drug toxicity. No long-term safety signals were identified.  Conclusions:   In this preplanned long-term analysis, OS favored ipilimumab plus radiotherapy versus placebo plus radiotherapy for patients with postdocetaxel mCRPC. OS rates at 3, 4, and 5 yr were approximately two to three times higher in the ipilimumab arm.

The most common tumor sites were prostate (23%), skin (17%), colorectum (15%) and breast (12%); 29% of patients had a metastatic disease; 231 patients (53%) belonged to the ""MPI-1"" group, 172 (40%) to the ""MPI-2"" group and 30 patients were classified in the ""MPI-3"" group. One-year mortality rate was 32% (23% in MPI-1, 41% in MPI-2 and 53% in MPI-3, p = 0.024). All domains of MPI except cognition and living status were significantly associated with mortality at one-year, as well as tumor sites and metastatic status. Higher MPI was associated with a higher mortality risk (adjusted HR 1.56 [95%CI 1.70-2.09] and 1.72 [1.33-2.22] for MPI groups 2 and 3 compared to 1; p < 0.0001).  Conclusions:   In addition to established risk factors, MPI improves risk prediction of 1-year mortality. This practical prognostic tool may help to optimize management of these vulnerable patients.""","""['Evelyne Liuu', 'Chunyun Hu', 'Simon Valero', 'Thomas Brunet', 'Amelie Jamet', 'Marie-Laure Bureau', 'Alberto Pilotto', 'Pierre-Jean Saulnier', 'Marc Paccalin']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Geriatr""","""['Development of an oncological-multidimensional prognostic index (Onco-MPI) for mortality prediction in older cancer patients.', 'Development and validation of a multidimensional prognostic index for one-year mortality from comprehensive geriatric assessment in hospitalized older patients.', 'Using a multidimensional prognostic index (MPI) based on comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) to predict mortality in elderly undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.', 'Using the Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI) to improve cost-effectiveness of interventions in multimorbid frail older persons: results and final recommendations from the MPI_AGE European Project.', 'Usefulness of the multidimensional prognostic index (MPI) in the management of older patients with chronic kidney disease.', 'The Multidimensional Prognostic Index as a Measure of Frailty in Elderly Patients with Head and Neck Cancer.']"""

We hypothesize that xanthorrhizol and d-δ-tocotrienol synergistically suppress the growth of murine B16 melanoma and human DU145 prostate carcinoma cells. Xanthorrhizol (0-200 µmol/L; half maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50] = 65 µmol/L) and d-δ-tocotrienol (0-40 µmol/L; IC50 = 20 µmol/L) each induced a concentration-dependent suppression of the proliferation of B16 cells and concurrent cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. A blend of 16.25 µmol/L xanthorrhizol and 10 µmol/L d-δ-tocotrienol suppressed B16 cell proliferation by 69%, an impact greater than the sum of those induced by xanthorrhizol (15%) and d-δ-tocotrienol (12%) individually. The blend cumulatively reduced the levels of cyclin-dependent kinase four and cyclin D1, key regulators of cell cycle progression at the G1 phase. The expression of RAS and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) in the proliferation-stimulating RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway was downregulated by the blend. Xanthorrhizol also induced a concentration-dependent suppression of the proliferation of DU145 cells with concomitant morphological changes. Isobologram confirmed the synergistic effect of xanthorrhizol and d-δ-tocotrienol on DU145 cell proliferation with combination index values ranging 0.61-0.94.

Methods: The initial RALP procedures using the SP robot by two surgeons were reviewed from prospective data collection at two institutions, MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDA) and OhioHealth Dublin Methodist Hospital (DMH). Both teams adopted different strategies regarding patient selection criteria, surgical approach, use of assistant ports, performance of lymphadenectomy, postoperative discharge criteria, and having a backup robot on standby. Results: The initial 74 consecutive patients who underwent SP-RALP at MDA and DMH (n = 34 and n = 40, respectively) were reviewed. All DMH and 24 MDA patients underwent a transperitoneal (TP) approach, whereas 10 MDA patients underwent an extraperitoneal (EP) approach. Mean operative time was similar for MDA and DMH, although it was shorter in TP patients. All MDA patients underwent nerve-sparing procedures and 12% underwent pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND); however, at DMH, all patients had PLND and 55% had nerve sparing. Mean estimated blood loss was not clinically significant for either group. Length of stay was 1.1 days (range, 1-2 days) for MDA and 0.12 days (range, 0--1 day) for DMH. No major complications occurred in either group other than two lymphoceles requiring percutaneous drainage in the EP SP-RALP group.

Bladder secondary tumors are rare and may be mistaken as bladder primary tumors because of their overlapping morphologic features. To avoid the diagnostic pitfalls, we analyzed the clinicopathologic features of bladder secondary tumors in a large cohort of patients. Our patient cohort consisted of 45 females and 38 males with a mean age of 58.7 ± 15.4 years (range 10-87 years). The tumors involved the bladder via direct extension from adjacent organs (n = 42) and distant metastasis (n = 41). In females, the majority of secondary tumors originated from the gynecologic tract (n = 25), and other common origins included the colon/rectum (n = 5) and breast (n = 4). In males, the most common origin was the prostate (n = 18), followed by the colon/rectum (n = 4) and kidney (n = 3). 75.9% of the secondary tumors were adenocarcinoma (n = 63), and other common tumor types included sarcoma (n = 6), squamous cell carcinoma (n = 5), melanoma (n = 4), and neuroendocrine carcinoma (n = 3). 67.5% of patients (n = 56) died of the disease with a median overall survival of 23 months from the time of secondary involvement of the bladder. Patients with secondary tumors via direct extension had a median survival time of 20 months, which was not significantly different from that for patients with secondary involvement via distant metastasis (24 months) (p = 0.83). Median survival in cases with prostate primary was 20 months as compared to 23 months for all other tumor types (p = 0.68). The majority of secondary tumors are composed of adenocarcinoma, which highlights the importance of differentiating primary from secondary involvement in bladder adenocarcinoma.

The major objectives of this study were to investigate the microbial composition of BPH tissues, its association with inflammation and check the effect of clinically isolated bacteria on prostate epithelial cells.  Methods:   The study includes 36 patients with a pathological diagnosis of BPH. Following strict aseptic measures, tissues were collected after transurethral resection of prostate, multiple pieces of the resected tissues were subjected to histopathological analysis, bacterial culture and genomic DNA extraction. Microbial composition was analyzed by culture and/or next-generation sequencing methods. Annotation of operational taxonomy unit has been done with an in-house algorithm. The extent of inflammation was scored through histological evaluation of tissue sections. The effect of clinical isolates on nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activity and induction of DNA-damage in the prostate epithelial cells were evaluated.  Results:   Histopathological analysis of the BPH tissues showed the presence of inflammation in almost all the tissues with a varied level at different regions of the same tissue section and the level of overall inflammation was different from patients to patients. Microbial culture of tissue samples showed the presence of live bacteria in 55.5% (20 out of 36) of the patient tissues. Majority of the isolates were coagulase-positive Staphylococcus, E. coli and Micrococcus spp. Further, V3 16S rRNA sequencing of the DNA isolated from BPH tissues showed the presence of multiple bacteria and the most common phylum in the BPH tissues were found to be Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes. The E. coli, isolated from one of the tissue was able to activate NF-κB and induce DNA damage in prostate epithelial cells. Phospho-histone γH2A.X staining confirmed the presence of cells with damaged DNA lesion in BPH tissues and also correlated with the severity of inflammation.  Conclusion:   Our study has shown that the BPH tissues do have a divergent microbial composition including the commonly found E. coli (phylum Proteobacteria), and these bacteria might contribute to the BPH-associated inflammation and/or tissue damage.

Materials and Methods: The distribution characteristics of 46 patients with CRC who were treated in the authors' hospital were retrospectively analyzed using the peritoneal cancer index (PCI). Results: The 46 patients in the study showed CRPC involvement in 203 of the 598 abdominal and pelvic regions studied (33.9%, 203/598). The regional proportions of CRPC involvement, from high to low, were as follows: region 6 (13.8%), region 0 (10.3%), region 1 (9.9%), region 5 (8.9%), region 7 (8.4%), region 3 (8.4%), region 2 (7.4%), region 4 (7.4%), region 11 (6.9%), region 8 (6.4%), region 12 (5.4%), region 9 (3.4%), and region 10 (3.4%).

The interaction between miR-3175 and SCN4B was determined by means of luciferase gene reporter, RT-qPCR, and western blotting assays. The results showed that miR-3175 expression was increased and SCN4B expression was decreased in prostate cancer cell lines as compared with normal human prostatic epithelial cells. Compared with the control group, knockdown of miR-3175 resulted in strong inhibitions of cell growth, migration, invasion, and N-cadherin expression, together with an increase in E-cadherin expression.

Little data exist in prostate cancer. We tested the association between sleep quality and prostate cancer diagnosis overall and by tumor grade in the Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events chemoprevention trial. We hypothesized that worse sleep quality would be associated with increased tumor aggressiveness.  Methods:   At baseline, 5614 men completed a validated six-item questionnaire on sleep quality. We generated a composite score categorized into tertiles to measure overall sleep quality and assessed each sleep quality question individually. Logistic regression was used to test associations between baseline sleep quality and overall, low-grade and high-grade prostate cancer diagnosis at 2-year study-mandated biopsy. Models were stratified by nocturia.  Results:   Overall sleep quality was unrelated to overall or low-grade prostate cancer. Worse overall sleep quality was associated with elevated odds of high-grade prostate cancer (odds ratio [OR]T3vsT1 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83-1.60 and ORT2vsT1 1.39; 95% CI: 1.01-1.92).

The L. tigris cultivar sclerotia (Ligno TG-K) was found to contain numerous bioactive compounds with beneficial biomedicinal properties and the sclerotial extract exhibited potent antioxidant activity. However, the anticancer property of the Ligno TG-K including in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects as well as its anticancer active compounds and the mechanisms has yet to be investigated.  Methods:   The cytotoxicity of the Ligno TG-K against human breast (MCF7), prostate (PC3) and lung (A549) adenocarcinoma cell lines was evaluated using MTT cytotoxicity assay. The cytotoxic mechanisms of the active high molecular weight proteins (HMWp) fraction were investigated through detection of caspases activity and apoptotic-related proteins expression by Western blotting. The in vivo antitumor activity of the isolated HMWp was examined using MCF7 mouse xenograft model. Shotgun LC-MS/MS analysis was performed to identify the proteins in the HMWp.  Results and discussion:   Cold water extract of the sclerotia inhibited proliferation of MCF7, A549 and PC3 cells with IC50 ranged from 28.9 to 95.0 µg/mL. Bioassay guided fractionation of the extract revealed that HMWp exhibited selective cytotoxicity against MCF7 cells via induction of cellular apoptosis by the activation of extrinsic and intrinsic signaling pathways. HMWp activated expression of caspase-8 and -9 enzymes, and pro-apoptotic Bax protein whilst inhibiting expression of tumor survivor protein, Bcl-2. HMWp induced tumor-cell apoptosis and suppressed growth of tumor in MCF-7 xenograft mice. Lectins, serine proteases, RNase Gf29 and a 230NA deoxyribonuclease are the major cytotoxic proteins that accounted for 55.93% of the HMWp.  Conclusion:   The findings from this study provided scientific evidences to support the traditional use of the L. tigris sclerotia for treatment of breast cancer. Several cytotoxic proteins with high abundance have been identified in the HMWp of the sclerotial extract and these proteins have potential to be developed into new anticancer agents or as adjunct cancer therapy.""","""['Boon Hong Kong', 'Kean Hooi Teoh', 'Nget Hong Tan', 'Chon Seng Tan', 'Szu Ting Ng', 'Shin Yee Fung']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PeerJ""","""['Shotgun proteomic analysis of tiger milk mushroom (Lignosus rhinocerotis) and the isolation of a cytotoxic fungal serine protease from its sclerotium.', 'In vivo anti-tumor activity of Lignosus rhinocerus TM02® using a MCF7-xenograft NCr nude mice model.', 'Molecular attributes and apoptosis-inducing activities of a putative serine protease isolated from Tiger Milk mushroom (Lignosus rhinocerus) sclerotium against breast cancer cells in vitro.', 'Energy and nutritional composition of Tiger milk mushroom (Lignosus tigris Chon S.

The present study aimed to investigate the potential mechanism of CCAT2 in PCa. In the present study, the reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) results indicated that CCAT2 expression was significantly upregulated in PCa tissues, and DU145 and PC3 cell lines compared with normal prostate tissues and the epithelial RWPE-1 cell line, respectively. Functional assays indicated that CCAT2 downregulation inhibited DU145 and PC3 cell proliferation, cell cycle, migration and invasion. In addition, the luciferase reporter assay, RT-qPCR and western blotting results indicated that CCAT2 regulated transcription factor 7 like 2 (TCF7L2) expression by binding to microRNA-217. Further western blotting and TOPFlash assays indicated that CCAT2-knockdown inhibited the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in DU145 and PC3 cell lines by inhibiting the expression of TCF7L2. However, CCAT2-knockdown-mediated effects were reversed by the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway activator lithium chloride (LiCl). Further cell experiments suggested that LiCl treatment reversed CCAT2-knockdown-mediated inhibition of PCa cell proliferation, cell cycle, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, migration and invasion.

It is important to diagnose the disease in the early stages. Current methods detect the disease with low specificity. Examining the expression of genes responsible for disease and their epigenetic regulators are good tools in this regard.  Material and methods:   In this prospective case-control study, 40 Iranian patients with cancer, 40 Iranian patients with prostate hyperplasia, and 40 control samples were examined. After blood sampling from each individual, RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, GSTP1, HDAC, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B expressions were measured in three understudy groups using specific primers and Real-Time PCR method.  Results:   A reverse correlation was identified between loss of GSTP1 expression and overexpression of HDAC, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B (P value < 0.0001) with a beneficial pattern of cancer development with high efficiency. The significant decrease of GSTP1 expression in patients in comparison to the healthy controls and the elevated expression levels of the studied epigenetic regulators in PCA and BPH samples indicate the impact of the regulators on GSTP1 expression activity.  Conclusion:   This study showed that the measurement of combined GSTP1 and its epigenetic regulators' expression could be used as suitable genetic markers for the detection and separation of healthy individuals from prostatic patient groups in the Iranian population.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are not fully understood. Recent studies on IGFBP-3 have indicated its intracellular functions in cell growth and apoptosis. The aim of this study was to confirm the benefits of low-dose VD3 treatment and clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying these beneficial effects in prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   The molecular effects of simultaneous treatment of LNCaP cells and their genetically modified cell lines with low concentration of docetaxel and VD3 were biologically and biochemically analyzed. To further determine the effects of VD3 treatment on IGFBP-3 induction system, cells were temporarily treated with VD3 in combination with a transcriptional inhibitor or protein synthesis inhibitor. Bcl-2 protein and its mRNA behavior were also observed in Igfbp-3 expression-modified LNCaP cells to determine the involvement of IGFBP-3 in the suppression of Bcl-2 by VD3 treatment.  Results:   Changes in IGFBP-3 expression levels in LNCaP cells indicated that it mediated the inhibition of cell growth induced by VD3 treatment. IGFBP-3 was also found to be a mediator of the enhanced cytotoxicity of prostate cancer cells to VD3 in combination with the anti-cancer drug. We further identified the distinct property of the IGFBP-3 induction system, wherein temporal VD3 stimulation-induced prolonged IGFBP-3 expression and VD3 treatment-induced increase in IGFBP-3 expression were optimized based on the protein concentration rather than the mRNA concentration. Meanwhile, Bcl-2 expression was down-regulated by VD3 treatment in an IGFBP-3-independent manner.  Conclusion:   These findings indicate the molecular mechanisms of IGFBP-3 induction stimulated by VD3 and IGFBP-3 independent Bcl-2 suppression by VD3 treatment in prostate cancer cells.

While PKA is a well-known regulator of physiological and oncogenic events, the role of PKI proteins in these pathways has remained elusive. Here, by measuring activation of the MAPK pathway downstream of GPCR-Gαs-cAMP signaling, we show that the expression levels of PKI proteins can alter the balance of activation of two major cAMP targets: PKA and EPAC. Our results indicate that PKA maintains repressive control over MAPK signaling as well as a negative feedback on cAMP concentration. Overexpression of PKI and its subsequent repression of PKA dysregulates these signaling pathways, resulting in increased intracellular cAMP, and enhanced activation of EPAC and MAPK. We also find that amplifications of PKIA are common in prostate cancer and are associated with reduced progression free survival. Depletion of PKIA in prostate cancer cells leads to reduced migration, increased sensitivity to anoikis and reduced tumor growth.

In countries without a nationwide cancer registry, an additional issue is estimating national incidence from local-registry data. The objectives of this study were to (i) promote the use of multidimensional penalized splines (MPS) for trend analyses; (ii) estimate the national cancer-incidence trends, using MPS, from only local-registry data; and (iii) propose a validation process of these estimates.  Methods:   We used an MPS model of age and year for trend analyses in France over 1990-2015 with a projection up to 2018. Validation was performed for 22 cancer sites and relied essentially on comparison with reference estimates that used the incidence/health-care ratio over the period 2011-2015. Alternative estimates that used the incidence/mortality ratio were also used to validate the trends.  Results:   In the validation assessment, the relative differences of the incidence estimates (2011-2015) with the reference estimates were <5% except for testis cancer in men and < 7% except for larynx cancer in women. Trends could be correctly derived since 1990 despite incomplete histories in some registries. The proposed method was applied to estimate the incidence and mortality trends of female lung cancer and prostate cancer in France.  Conclusions:   The validation process confirmed the validity of the national French estimates; it may be applied in other countries to help in choosing the most appropriate national estimation method according to country-specific contexts. MPS form a powerful statistical tool for trend analyses; they allow trends to vary smoothly with age and are suitable for modelling simple as well as complex trends thanks to penalization.

When delivering radiotherapy to prostate and pelvic lymph nodes, daily inter- and intra-fraction anatomical changes need to be accounted for. Planning target volume (PTV) margins, grown from the pelvic lymph node clinical target volume need to be determined, to account for this variation in position.  Methods:   Twenty patients who had daily online image guided radiotherapy to prostate and pelvic lymph nodes between April and December 2018 were selected. Ten pre-treatment verification images using cone beam CT from each patient were registered to pelvic bone anatomy, prostate soft tissue or fiducial markers and pelvic lymph node soft tissue to assess the accuracy of treatment delivery. Population systematic and random errors and PTV margins were calculated.  Results:   PTV margins of 0.4 cm, 0.4 cm and 0.7 cm left-right (LR), superior-inferior (SI) and anterior-posterior (AP) respectively were derived for the pelvic lymph nodes when registering to prostate. PTV margins of 0.3 cm, 0.2 cm and 0.4 cm LR, SI and AP respectively were derived for the pelvic lymph nodes when registering to bone. There was a posterior systematic shift of the prostate during the treatment course.  Conclusion:   There is differential motion of pelvic lymph nodes to prostate and in the era of prostate and pelvic radiotherapy for patients with node positive prostate cancer; there is increasing importance in the accuracy of dose delivery to the involved lymph node. Hence, this group of patients may benefit from personalised radiotherapy PTV margins, especially if the involved pelvic lymph node is within the anterior part of the clinical target volume.

With higher doses delivered over fewer fractions, motion adaptation is a requirement for accurate delivery of SABR. This study compared the efficacy of multileaf collimator (MLC) tracking vs. gating as a real-time motion adaptation strategy for prostate SABR patients enrolled in a clinical trial.  Methods:   Forty-four prostate cancer patients treated over five fractions in the TROG 15.01 SPARK trial were analysed in this study. Forty-nine fractions were treated using MLC tracking and 166 fractions were treated using beam gating and couch shifts. A time-resolved motion-encoded dose reconstruction method was used to evaluate the dose delivered using each motion adaptation strategy and compared to an estimation of what would have been delivered with no motion adaptation strategy implemented.  Results:   MLC tracking and gating both delivered doses closer to the plan compared to when no motion adaptation strategy was used. Differences between MLC tracking and gating were small with differences in the mean discrepancy from the plan of -0.3% (CTV D98%), 1.4% (CTV D2%), 0.4% (PTV D95%), 0.2% (rectum V30Gy) and 0.0% (bladder V30Gy). On average, 0.5 couch shifts were required per gated fractions with a mean interruption duration of 1.8 ± 2.6 min per fraction treated using gating.  Conclusion:   Both MLC tracking and gating were effective strategies at improving the accuracy of the dose delivered to the target and organs at risk. While dosimetric performance was comparable, gating resulted in interruptions to treatment.

Epithelial and inflammatory cells release reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) that can damage DNA. ROS/RNS have biological implications in both chemoresistance and tumor recurrence. As several clinically employed anticancer drugs can generate ROS/RNS, we have addressed herein how inducible nitric oxide synthase and nitric oxide (iNOS/•NO) affect the molecular pathways implicated in the tumor response to oxidative stress. To mimic the oxidative stress associated with chemotherapy, we used a photosensitizer (pheophorbide a) that can generate ROS/RNS in a controlled manner. We investigated how iNOS/•NO modulates the tumor response to oxidative stress by involving the NF-κB and Nrf2 molecular pathways. We found that low levels of iNOS induce the development of a more aggressive tumor population, leading to survival, recurrence and resistance. By contrast, high levels of iNOS/•NO sensitize tumor cells to oxidative treatment, causing cell growth arrest. Our analysis showed that NF-κB and Nrf2, which are activated in response to oxidative stress, communicate with each other through RKIP. For this critical role, RKIP could be an interesting target for anticancer drugs. Our study provides insight into the complex signaling response of cancer cells to oxidative treatments as well as new possibilities for the rational design of new therapeutic strategies.""","""[""Francesca D'Este"", 'Emilia Della Pietra', 'Gretta Veronica Badillo Pazmay', 'Luigi E Xodo', 'Valentina Rapozzi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Biochem Pharmacol""","""['Repeated sub-optimal photodynamic treatments with pheophorbide a induce an epithelial mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer cells via nitric oxide.', 'Glucocorticoids induce production of reactive oxygen species/reactive nitrogen species and DNA damage through an iNOS mediated pathway in breast cancer.', 'Nitric oxide activated by p38 and NF-kappaB facilitates apoptosis and cell cycle arrest under oxidative stress in evodiamine-treated human melanoma A375-S2 cells.', 'A systematic review of p53 regulation of oxidative stress in skeletal muscle.', 'Nitric oxide synthase inhibition and oxidative stress in cardiovascular diseases: possible therapeutic targets?', 'Understanding the Photodynamic Therapy Induced Bystander and Abscopal Effects: A Review.', 'The Nitric Oxide Donor Zn(PipNONO)Cl Exhibits Antitumor Activity through Inhibition of Epithelial and Endothelial Mesenchymal Transitions.', 'Gasotransmitters in the tumor microenvironment: Impacts on cancer chemotherapy (Review).', 'Insights of RKIP-Derived Suppression of Prostate Cancer.', 'QTMP, a Novel Thiourea Polymer, Causes DNA Damage to Exert Anticancer Activity and Overcome Multidrug Resistance in Colorectal Cancer Cells.']"""

The goal of this study was to assess the number and type of patients that would qualify for lung cancer screening based upon recommendations by various guidelines.  Methods:   We prospectively collected a patient reported questionnaire, including smoking history, family history, exposure history, and demographics, from April-October 2017 from new consults in the Department of Radiation Oncology and Otolaryngology (ORL). Patients smoking status and patient factors were collected and reported. Patients qualifying for screening by USPSTF, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), and Tammemagi scoring criteria were identified. Multivariate analysis assessed the factors associated with positive criteria for screening and the sensitivity of each criterion was calculated.  Results:   There were 546 new consults during the study period and 528 successfully completed the questionnaire.

Increasing evidence revealed a significant association between the A allele of rs2274911 and male diseases, such as oligospermia, cryptorchidism, and prostate tumor. However, the function of rs2274911 in healthy males is unclear.  Subjects and methods:   A total of 1742 healthy men were selected from the Fangchenggang Area Male Health and Examination Survey (FAMHES).

RNA sequencing was performed on PC3 cells.  Results:   E2 and PSA serum levels increased with the accumulation of the A allele (E2: G vs. A, -0.029 [-0.050, -0.008], P < 0.01, P trend = 0.027; PSA: G vs. A, -0.040 [-0.079, 0.000], P < 0.05, P trend = 0.048). rs2274911 enhanced the proliferation and invasion ability of PC3 or 293T cells and activated the ERK pathway.

Objective:   To determine threshold and margin combinations that satisfy the following criteria: ≥95% sensitivity with max specificity and ≥95% specificity with max sensitivity.  Design, setting and participants:   We registered pathologist-annotated whole-mount mid-gland prostatectomy histology sections cut in 4.4 mm intervals from 12 patients to pre-surgical PSMA-PET/MRI by mapping histology to ex-vivo imaging to in-vivo imaging. We generated PET-derived tumor volumes using boundaries defined by thresholded PET volumes from 1-100% of SUV3max in 1% intervals. At each interval, we applied margins of 0-30 voxels in one voxel increments, giving 3000 volumes/patient.  Outcome measurements:   Mean and standard deviation of sensitivity and specificity for cancer detection within the 2D oblique histologic planes that intersected with the 3D PET volume for each patient.  Results and limitations:   A threshold of 67% SUV max with an 8.4 mm margin achieved a (mean ± std.) sensitivity of 95.0 ± 7.8% and specificity of 76.4 ± 14.7%.

Methods:   Eighty-one biopsy-naive patients with preoperative mpMRI and Ga-68 PSMA PET who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) were evaluated retrospectively. Forty-nine patients had PIRADS 4 and 32 had PIRADS 5 index lesions. The localization, grade, and volumetric properties of dominant (DT) and non-dominant tumors (NDT) in RP were compared to the index lesions of mpMRI and Ga-68 PSMA PET.  Results:   The median age and PSA level were 62 (IQR; 59-69) years and 7 (IQR; 2-8) ng/ml, respectively. Ga-68 PSMA PET detected DTs in 100% of the patients including 13 patients in whom mpMR failed.

The comparison between these two radionuclides has several advantages in radiation protection. The aim of this prospective study was to identify which of these two radionuclides can help in predicting the equivalent dose using the maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) of normal organs, the kidneys. Two groups of 40 patients (total n = 80) who underwent PET/CT using Ga or F for diagnosis of prostate cancer between April 2018 and December 2018 at the American University of Beirut Medical Center were included. First, the dose rates were measured after 1 h of radionuclide uptake at 1 m distance with background of 0.015 μSv h. Then, SUVmax for kidneys were determined from images obtained with PET/CT 1 h after injection of both radionuclides. The ratios of the equivalent doses to the SUVmax for kidneys were compared for both Ga-PSMA and F-Choline. There is a positive moderate relationship between the SUVmax for kidneys and the Ga dose rate after 1 h of injection at 1 m distance from the abdomen (p-value = 0.023 < 0.05). This relationship is statistically significant. However, there is a very low negative relationship between the SUVmax kidney and F dose rate after 1 h of injection at 1 m distance from the abdomen (p-value = 0.93 > 0.05).

Methods:   We reviewed the medical charts of patients at the University Hospital of SUNY Downstate Medical Center for whom prostate biopsies or excisions were performed (2015-2019). We then computed the prevalence of prostate cancer and high grade tumors. To determine if there was a quantitative relationship between PSA and Gleason score, we used linear regression analysis. We further used the Fisher exact test to determine if there exists a serum PSA level beyond which the diagnosis of high-grade prostate cancer is definitive.  Results:   The prevalence of prostate cancer was high at 75.8%; of these cancers, 70% were found to be high grade. Ninety two percent of PSA values were ≥ 4.0ng/mL; the sensitivity was 94%; the positive predictive value was 80%. There was a poor correlation between PSA and Gleason score (R2=0.1), but almost 30 percent of PSA values were >20 ng/mL, and almost all of these corresponded to high grade tumors (Fisher exact test, p<0.00001, α=0.05). Fifteen cancers extended beyond the capsule or metastasized; all were high grade tumors.  Conclusions:   These patients presented with a high frequency of high-grade prostate cancer and elevated PSA values, such that PSA> 20ng/mL are virtually diagnostic of high-grade prostate cancer.

Methods and materials:   Patients with prostate cancer on a prospective trial evaluating the toxicity of robotic-based SBRT were treated to a total dose of 35 Gy in 5 fractions. Fifteen patients were included in this analysis. During ultrasound-based fiducial implantation, a three-dimensional data set as in real HDR-BRT procedure was acquired. Virtual HDR-BRT plans were generated and various organs at risk and prostate dosimetric parameters were evaluated.  Results:   Concerning prostate, SBRT achieved significant higher D98, V35 Gy, and V37.5 Gy coverage, whereas virtual HDR-BRT achieved significant higher intratumoral doses reflected in the V42 Gy and V52.5 Gy. Rectal Dmax, V36 Gy, and V29 Gy were significantly lower for HDR-BRT with no difference as for V18 Gy. SBRT was significantly inferior regarding bladder dosimetry (Dmax, V36 Gy, V18 Gy), whereas urethra Dmax and V44 Gy where significantly higher at the expense of HDR-BRT.

We optimized several exosome-EV isolation technologies for their use in semen, evaluating EV purifying effectiveness and impact on the downstream analysis of miRNAs against results from the standard ultracentrifugation (UC) method to implement the use of SP sEV_miRNAs as noninvasive biomarkers for PCa. Our results evidenced that commercial kits designed to isolate exosomes/EVs from blood or urine are mostly applicable to SP, but showed quantitative and qualitative variability between them.

This is possibly due to different extraction techniques yielding different proportions of sEV subtypes. This is evidence that the exosome-EV isolation method has a significant impact on the analysis of the miRNAs contained within, with important consequences for their use as clinical biomarkers. Therefore, miRNA analysis results for EVs cannot be directly extrapolated between different EV isolation methods until clear markers for delineation between microvesicles and exosomes are established.

These cells produce high levels of extracellular adenosine which has been associated with increased chemoresistance, migration, and invasion in glioblastoma. In this study, we attempted to elucidate the mechanisms that control extracellular adenosine levels in GSC subtypes. By using primary and U87MG-derived GSCs, we associated increased extracellular adenosine with the mesenchymal phenotype. [3H]-adenosine uptake occurred mainly through the equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs) in GSCs, but mesenchymal GSCs have lower expression and ENT1-mediated uptake activity than proneural GSCs. By analyzing expression and enzymatic activity, we determined that ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73) is predominantly expressed in proneural GSCs, driving AMPase activity. While in mesenchymal GSCs, both CD73 and Prostatic Acid Phosphatase (PAP) contribute to the AMP (adenosine monophosphate) hydrolysis. We did not observe significant differences between the expression of proteins involved in the metabolization of adenosine among the GCSs subtypes.

We aimed to determine the role of exosomal ITGA2 derived from castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) cells in promoting aggressive phenotypes in androgen receptor (AR)-positive cells. Exosomes were co-incubated with recipient cells and tested for different cellular assays. ITGA2 was enriched in exosomes derived from CRPC cells. Co-culture of AR-positive cells with CRPC-derived exosomes increased their proliferation, migration, and invasion by promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which was reversed via ITGA2 knockdown or inhibition of exosomal uptake by methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD). Ectopic expression of ITGA2 reproduced the effect of exosomal ITGA2 in PCa cells. ITGA2 transferred by exosomes exerted its effect within a shorter time compared to that triggered by its endogenous expression. The difference of ITGA2 protein expression in localized tumors and those with lymph node metastatic tissues was indistinguishable.

We investigated the impact of vasectomy on prostate cancer outgrowth, mainly using preclinical models. Neoplastic changes in the prostate were compared in transgenic TRAMP mice that underwent vasectomy vs. sham surgery performed at 4 weeks of age. One of the molecules identified by DNA microarray (i.e., ZKSCAN3) was then assessed in radical prostatectomy specimens and human prostate cancer lines. At 24 weeks, gross tumor (p = 0.089) and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (p = 0.036) occurred more often in vasectomized mice. Vasectomy significantly induced ZKSCAN3 expression in prostate tissues from C57BL/6 mice and prostate cancers from TRAMP mice. Immunohistochemistry showed increased ZKSCAN3 expression in adenocarcinoma vs. prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), PIN vs. non-neoplastic prostate, Grade Group ≥3 vs. ≤2 tumors, pT3 vs. pT2 tumors, pN1 vs. pN0 tumors, and prostate cancer from patients with a history of vasectomy. Additionally, strong (2+/3+) ZKSCAN3 expression (p = 0.002), as an independent prognosticator, or vasectomy (p = 0.072) was associated with the risk of tumor recurrence. In prostate cancer lines, ZKSCAN3 silencing resulted in significant decreases in cell proliferation/migration/invasion.

Identifying mutations that cause resistant phenotype is of critical importance for guiding treatment protocols, as well as for designing drugs that do not elicit adverse responses. However, experimental characterization of these mutations is time consuming and costly; thus, predictive models are needed to anticipate resistant mutations and to guide the drug discovery process. In this work, we leverage experimental data collected on 68 AR mutants, either observed in the clinic or described in the literature, to train a deep neural network (DNN) that predicts the response of these mutants to currently used and experimental anti-androgens and testosterone. We demonstrate that the use of this DNN, with general 2D descriptors, provides a more accurate prediction of the biological outcome (inhibition, activation, no-response, mixed-response) in AR mutant-drug pairs compared to other machine learning approaches. Finally, the developed approach was used to make predictions of AR mutant response to the latest AR inhibitor darolutamide, which were then validated by in-vitro experiments.""","""['Oliver Snow', 'Nada Lallous', 'Martin Ester', 'Artem Cherkasov']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Cheminformatics Modeling of Adverse Drug Responses by Clinically Relevant Mutants of Human Androgen Receptor.', 'Darolutamide is a potent androgen receptor antagonist with strong efficacy in prostate cancer models.', 'Strategy for Tumor-Selective Disruption of Androgen Receptor Function in the Spectrum of Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor antagonists for prostate cancer therapy.', 'Targeting the androgen receptor and overcoming resistance in prostate cancer.', 'DeepAR: a novel deep learning-based hybrid framework for the interpretable prediction of androgen receptor antagonists.', 'Simulating androgen receptor selection in designer yeast.', 'The promising role of new molecular biomarkers in prostate cancer: from coding and non-coding genes to artificial intelligence approaches.', 'Applications of Machine Learning to Predict Cisplatin Resistance in Lung Cancer.', 'Prediction of Protein-ligand Interaction Based on Sequence Similarity and Ligand Structural Features.']"""

Methods:   Between 2012 and 2015, blood samples were prospectively collected from patients with National Comprehensive Cancer Network high-risk localized prostate cancer undergoing either radiotherapy (XRT) plus androgen deprivation therapy or radical prostatectomy (RP) with curative intent. Samples were analyzed with the Epic Sciences platform with 4J,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, CD45, cytokeratin (CK), and androgen receptor (AR) N-terminal staining. CTC counts were correlated with biochemical recurrence (BCR).  Results:   A diversity of CTC subtypes, including CK-positive, CK-negative, AR-positive, and CTC clusters, were observed in 73.3% (33 of 45) of patients with evaluable data. The median follow-up was 14.2 months (range, 0.5 to 43.7 months). BCR occurred more frequently in the RP group than XRT (15 of 26 v one of 19), with most patients in the XRT group continuing to receive androgen deprivation therapy. A higher proportion of metastatic events were observed in the RP group (five of 26 v one of 19). In the RP group, BCR and development of metastases were associated with a higher total number of CTCs, AR-positive CTCs, and CTC phenotypic heterogeneity. One patient who developed BCR and metastases quickly after RP had diverse phenotypical CTC subtypes, and single-cell genomic analyses of all detectable CTCs confirmed common prostate cancer copy number alterations and PTEN loss.  Conclusion:   CTCs can be identified in most patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer before definitive therapy using the Epic Sciences platform. If confirmed in a larger cohort with longer follow-up, phenotypic and genomic characterization of CTCs pretherapy may provide an additional means of risk stratifying patients with newly diagnosed high-risk disease and potentially help identify patients who could require multimodal therapy.""","""['Simpa S Salami', 'Udit Singhal', 'Daniel E Spratt', 'Ganesh S Palapattu', 'Brent K Hollenbeck', 'Joseph D Schonhoft', 'Ryon Graf', 'Jessica Louw', 'Adam Jendrisak', 'Lyndsey Dugan', 'Yipeng Wang', 'Scott A Tomlins', 'Ryan Dittamore', 'Felix Y Feng', 'Todd M Morgan']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""JCO Precis Oncol""","""['Limited prognostic value of preoperative circulating tumor cells for early biochemical recurrence in patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Chromosomal Instability Estimation Based on Next Generation Sequencing and Single Cell Genome Wide Copy Number Variation Analysis.', 'Determination of the androgen receptor status of circulating tumour cells in metastatic breast cancer patients.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer and circulating tumor cells.', 'Network approach in liquidomics landscape.', 'Recent Advances in Blood-Based Liquid Biopsy Approaches in Prostate Cancer.', 'A survey of open questions in adaptive therapy: Bridging mathematics and clinical translation.', 'Recent Advances in Methods for Circulating Tumor Cell Detection.', 'Prediction of Biochemical Recurrence Based on Molecular Detection of Lymph Node Metastasis After Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

However, association with patient prognosis remains unclear. This study derives an inflammatory gene signature associated with AR expression and investigates CD3+ and CD8+ T-lymphocyte infiltration association with AR and prognosis.  Methods:   Gene profiling of inflammatory related genes was performed on 71 prostate biopsies. Immunohistochemistry on 243 hormone-naïve prostate cancers was performed for CD3, CD8, AR, and phosphorylated AR tumor expression.  Results:   Multiple proinflammatory genes were differentially expressed in association with high AR expression compared with low AR expression including PI3KCA and MAKP8 (adjusted P < .05). High CD3+ and high CD8+ infiltration associated with reduced cancer-specific survival (P = .018 and P = .020, respectively). High CD3+ infiltration correlated with high tumor cytoplasmic AR expression and if assessed together, they associated with reduced cancer-specific and 5-year survival from 90% to 56% (P = .000179). High CD8+ cytotoxic infiltration associated with high androgen-independent tumor nuclear AR serine 213 phosphorylation (correlation coefficient = 0.227; P = .003) and when assessed together associated with poor clinico-pathological features including perineural invasion (P = .001). Multiple genes involved in proinflammatory signaling pathways are upregulated in high AR expressing prostate samples.

Here, we demonstrate prostate cancer-targeted gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for MR-guided radiotherapy to improve the targeting precision and efficacy. By conjugating Gd(III) complexes and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeting ligands to AuNP surfaces, we found enhanced uptake of AuNPs by PSMA-expressing cancer cells with excellent MR contrast and radiation therapy outcome in vitro and in vivo. The AuNPs binding affinity and r1 relaxivity were dramatically improved and the combination of Au and Gd(III)provided better tumor suppression after radiation.

In this study, a lab-on-membrane platform that can be combined with paper spray ionization mass spectrometry was developed for the in situ high-throughput sensitive detection of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The sensitivity of the proposed platform was enhanced via two strategies: (1) the synthesis of a biotin-streptavidin scaffold caused an increase in the capturing efficiency of PSA by a factor of 5 and (2) the immobilization of a large number of mass tag molecules on the gold nanoparticles allowed for the amplification of the mass spectrometry signals. The limit of detection was approximately 3.0 pg mL-1. The selectivity to PSA was guaranteed by using an antibody-aptamer pairing sandwich immunoassay, and PSA detection was unaffected even when other protein antigens (carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 125) were present. The modified membranes maintained their performance for at least 30 days when stored at 4 °C. Finally, analysis of human serum samples confirmed that the PSA concentration as determined using the proposed platform was consistent with that determined with a conventional chemiluminescent immunoassay.

Thus, in the current study, Raman spectroscopy of prostate cancer cells fixed before (the physicochemical damage model) and just after (the biological response model) irradiation was undertaken to compare biochemical composition of irradiated cancer cells at both stages. Spectroscopic analysis of the cells was performed separately for cytoplasmic and nuclear regions. Biochemical changes of irradiated cells were analyzed using partial least squares regression (PLSR) method on the basis of the collected Raman spectra.

Clonal evolution can be reconstructed from estimates of the relative abundance (frequency) of subclone-specific alterations in tumor biopsies, which, in turn, inform on its composition. However, estimating these frequencies is complicated by the high genetic instability that characterizes many cancers. Models for genetic instability suggest that copy number alterations (CNAs) can influence mutation-frequency estimates and thus impede efforts to reconstruct tumor phylogenies. Our analysis suggested that accurate mutation frequency estimates require accounting for CNAs-a challenging endeavour using the genetic profile of a single tumor biopsy. Instead, we propose an optimization algorithm, Chimæra, to account for the effects of CNAs using profiles of multiple biopsies per tumor. Analyses of simulated data and tumor profiles suggested that Chimæra estimates are consistently more accurate than those of previously proposed methods and resulted in improved phylogeny reconstructions and subclone characterizations.

Objective:   To validate an email-based patient-reported outcomes tracking system in assessing pad-free continence rates and time-to continence recovery following RP.  Patients and methods:   483 men undergoing RP by a single surgeon from November 2013 to March 2019 were prospectively assigned to 1 of 3 tracking systems: 1) a preaddressed paper packet containing a pad-free card and daily urinary pad log, (N = 249); 2) an automated email questionnaire, (N = 234) or 3) both (N = 51). Patients tracked electronically received electronic Research Electronic Data Capture surveys 30 days after catheter removal, with up to 3 reminders sent automatically if no response was received within 2 days. Response rates and continence rates were compared in group 1 vs. group 2 via student t-tests; time-to pad-free status was assessed for concordance among men in group 3 via linear regression.  Results:   Thirty-day response rates in group 1 (paper) vs. group 2 (electronic) were 80.7% (201/249) and 94.0% (220/234), (P < 0.0001); pad-free rates were 64.2% (129/201) and 64.1% (141/220), (P = 0.9847), respectively. Similarly, 1-year response rates in group 1 and 2 were 87.6% (218/249) vs. 94.0% (220/234), (P = 0.0146); pad-free rates were 91.7% (200/218) vs. 96.4% (212/220), (P = 0.0411), respectively.

Methods:   We conducted semi-structured interviews of radiation oncologists between January-May, 2016. We used a purposeful sampling technique to select participants across a wide range of experience, regions, and practice types. Two trained qualitative researchers used an inductive, iterative approach to code transcripts and identify themes. We then used content analysis and thematic analysis of the coded transcripts to understand radiation oncologists' attitudes and beliefs about IMRT and SBRT.  Results:   Thematic saturation was achieved after 20 interviews. Participants were affiliated with academic (n = 13; 65%), private (n = 5; 25%), and mixed (n = 2; 10%) practices and had a wide range of clinical experience (median 19 years; range 4-49 years). Analysis of interview transcripts revealed four general themes: 1) most radiation oncologists offered surgery, brachytherapy, IMRT, and active surveillance for low-risk patients; 2) there was no consensus on the comparative effectiveness of IMRT and SBRT; 3) key barriers to adopting SBRT included issues related to insurance, reimbursement, and practice inertia; and 4) despite these barriers, most participants envisioned SBRT use increasing over the next 5-10 years.  Conclusions:   In the absence of strong opinions about effectiveness, nonclinical factors influence the choice of radiation treatment.

A physical rehabilitation programme early postoperatively might prevent or at least alleviate these potential complications and improve physical function. The main aim of the CanMoRe trial is to evaluate the impact of a standardised and individually adapted exercise intervention in primary health care to improve physical function (primary outcome) and habitual physical activity, health-related quality of life, fatigue, psychological wellbeing and readmissions due to complications in patients undergoing robotic-assisted radical cystectomy for urinary bladder cancer.  Methods:   In total, 120 patients will be included and assigned to either intervention or control arm of the study. All patients will receive preoperative information on the importance of early mobilisation and during the hospital stay they will follow a standard protocol for enhanced mobilisation. The intervention group will be given a referral to a physiotherapist in primary health care close to their home. Within the third week after discharge, the intervention group will begin 12 weeks of biweekly exercise. The exercise programme includes aerobic and strengthening exercises. The control group will receive oral and written information about a home-based exercise programme. Physical function will serve as the primary outcome and will be measured using the Six-minute walk test. Secondary outcomes are gait speed, handgrip strength, leg strength, habitual physical activity, health-related quality of life, fatigue, psychological wellbeing and readmissions due to complications. The measurements will be conducted at discharge (i.e. baseline), post-intervention and 1 year after surgery. To evaluate the effects of the intervention mixed or linear regression models according to the intention to treat procedure will be used.  Discussion:   This proposed randomised controlled trial has the potential to provide new knowledge within rehabilitation after radical cystectomy for urinary bladder cancer. The programme should be easy to apply to other patient groups undergoing abdominal surgery for cancer and has the potential to change the health care chain for these patients.

Comparing results from human readers to those of ML-based analyses, up to 98% area under the curve (AUC), 94% sensitivity (SE), and 89% specificity (SP) were achieved. Interestingly, textural features assessed in native low-dose CT increased the accuracy significantly. Thus, ML based on 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT radiomics features can classify hotspots with high precision, comparable to that of experienced NM physicians.

BaP is strongly associated with prostate carcinogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism of BaP in development of prostate carcinoma remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect and mechanism of BaP on the development in prostate cancer. PC-3 cells were exposed to different concentrations of BaP for 24, 48, 72 h, respectively. We analyzed the effect of BaP on PC-3 cell viability, cell cycle, DNA strand breaks, mutagenic activity, and migration. The expression of associated regulatory genes and the effect of JAK2/STAT3 signaling were also measured to explore the relationships among BaP metabolism, the JAK2/STAT3 pathway and proliferative activity in PC-3 cells. We observed significant effects on proliferation, DNA strand breaks and mutagenic activity after BaP exposure in PC-3 cells, and inhibitors of CYP1 and the AhR transcription factor α -naphthoflavone (ANF) and CH223191 treatment clearly reduced both cell survival and mutagenesis associated with BaP exposure. Reduction in G0-G1 phase population and elevation in S phase were observed after BaP exposure. Migratory cells for PC-3 were significantly increased. The results were further confirmed by the expression of mRNA levels in the significant increments of Snail, Slug, MMP-9, CYP1A1, CYP1B1, CycilnD1, CDK4 and significant reduction of E-cadherin. Significant enhancements were found in the expression of JAK2, STAT3 after BaP treatment. Additionally, activator IL-6 significantly enhanced the effect of BaP on cell survival, mutagenic activity, Cyclin D1, CDK4, Snail, and JAK2/STAT3 expression in PC-3 cells. Significant reductions in cell survival, mutagenic activity, Cyclin D1, CDK4, Snail, and JAK2/STAT3 expression were found after inhibitor AG490, ANF and CHJ223191 treatment.

Objective:   To explore the differential expression pattern of miRNAs in obesity and their putative role in obesity-related comorbidities such as insulin resistance.  Methods:   An Affymetrix-miRNA array was performed in plasma samples from normoweight (n = 4/body mass index < 25) and obese subjects (n = 4/body mass index > 30). The main changes were validated in 2 independent cohorts (n = 221/n = 18). Additionally, in silico approaches were performed and in vitro assays applied in tissue samples and prostate (RWPE-1) and liver (HepG2) cell-lines.  Results:   A total of 26 microRNAs were altered (P < 0.01) in plasma of obese subjects compared to controls using the Affymetrix-miRNA array. Validation in ampler cohorts revealed that miR-4454 levels were consistently higher in obesity, associated with insulin-resistance (Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance/insulin) and modulated by medical (metformin/statins) and surgical (bariatric surgery) strategies. miR-4454 was highly expressed in prostate and liver tissues and its expression was increased in prostate and liver cells by insulin. In vitro, overexpression of miR-4454 in prostate cells resulted in decreased expression levels of INSR, GLUT4, and phosphorylation of AMPK/AKT/ERK, as well as in altered expression of key spliceosome components (ESRP1/ESRP2/RBM45/RNU2) and insulin-receptor splicing variants.  Conclusions:   Obesity was associated to an alteration of the plasmatic miRNA landscape, wherein miR-4454 levels were higher, associated with insulin-resistance and modulated by obesity-controlling interventions. Insulin regulated miR-4454, which, in turn may impair the cellular response to insulin, in a cell type-dependent manner (i.e., prostate gland), by modulating the splicing process.""","""['Vicente Herrero-Aguayo', 'Juan M Jiménez-Vacas', 'Prudencio Sáez-Martínez', 'Enrique Gómez-Gómez', 'Juan L López-Cánovas', 'Lourdes Garrido-Sánchez', 'Aura D Herrera-Martínez', 'Laura García-Bermejo', 'Manuel Macías-González', 'José López-Miranda', 'Justo P Castaño', 'Manuel D Gahete', 'Raúl M Luque']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Clin Endocrinol Metab""","""['Altered Expression of miR-181a-5p and miR-23a-3p Is Associated With Obesity and TNFα-Induced Insulin Resistance.', 'Comprehensive functional screening of miRNAs involved in fat cell insulin sensitivity among women.', 'Obesity-related hypoxia via miR-128 decreases insulin-receptor expression in human and mouse adipose tissue promoting systemic insulin resistance.', 'Influence of miRNA in insulin signaling pathway and insulin resistance: micro-molecules with a major role in type-2 diabetes.', 'Metabolism and insulin signaling in common metabolic disorders and inherited insulin resistance.', 'Biomarkers of obesity-mediated insulin resistance: focus on microRNAs.', 'Recent Advances in Extracellular Vesicles in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Emergent Perspectives.', 'Effects of plasma-derived exosomes from the normal and thin Bactrian camels on hepatocellular carcinoma and their differences at transcriptome and proteomics levels.', 'Alternative Methods as Tools for Obesity Research: In Vitro and In Silico Approaches.', 'Evaluation of Exosomal Coding and Non-Coding RNA Signature in Obese Adolescents.']"""

Its mutual verification with UCL signal was favorable for ensuring the accuracy of the assay. A UCL-IRA sandwich detection method was established for the detection of the prostate-specific antigen. The UCL intensity at 542 nm and IRA at 1095 cm-1 were chosen for quantitative assay. The method has high sensitivity (0.05 pg mL-1) and selectivity.

The community-engaged educational intervention targeted both men and women and included eight 90-min sessions per cohort. Topics included prostate cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental health, health-care access, and healthy lifestyle. Sessions were both didactic and interactive. A pre-/post-intervention questionnaire assessed knowledge. Interviews were conducted with male participants and a focus group discussion (FGD) with women to assess program impact. Interview and FGD transcripts were analyzed for themes and recommendations. Major themes were-increased knowledge/awareness of risk associated with chronic conditions, change in health-care-seeking attitudes, increased self-efficacy to engage the health-care system, and lifestyle changes. Other impacts reported were building community/social support, a safe and enabling learning environment, and enhanced community health status overall. Recommendations included having extended, more in-depth sessions, targeting the younger generation, smaller cohort sizes, and more community-based health programming.

Methods:   CNN, widely applied in medical image classification, was used for bone scintigraphy image classification. The retrospective study included 778 sequential male patients who underwent whole-body bone scans. A nuclear medicine physician classified all the cases into 3 categories: (1) normal, (2) malignant, and (3) degenerative, which were used as the gold standard.  Results:   An efficient CNN architecture was built, based on CNN exploration performance, achieving high prediction accuracy. The results showed that the method is sufficiently precise when it comes to differentiating a bone metastasis from other either degenerative changes or normal tissue (overall classification accuracy = 91.42% ± 1.64%). To strengthen the outcomes of this study the authors further compared the best performing CNN method to other popular CNN architectures for medical imaging, like ResNet50, VGG16 and GoogleNet, as reported in the literature.  Conclusions:   The prediction results reveal the efficacy of the proposed CNN-based approach and its ability for an easier and more precise interpretation of whole-body images in bone metastasis diagnosis for prostate cancer patients in nuclear medicine.

Methods:   We estimated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for second primary non-prostate malignancies by race/ethnicity (non-Latino white, Black, Asian/Pacific Islander [API] and Latino), by Gleason, and by time since prostate cancer diagnosis. Poisson regression models were used to test heterogeneity between groups with the expected number as the offset.  Results:   60,707 second primary malignancies were observed. SIRs for all second cancers combined varied significantly by race/ethnicity: SIRwhite: 0.88 (95% confidence interval: 0.87-0.89), SIRLatino: 0.92 (0.89-0.95), SIRBlack: 0.97 (0.95-0.99), and SIRAPI: 1.05 (1.01-1.09) (p-heterogeneity < 0.001). SIRs for all cancers combined were higher among survivors of higher vs. lower Gleason prostate cancers irrespective of race/ethnicity. We observed significant heterogeneity by race/ethnicity in SIRs for 9 of 14 second cancer types investigated including lung, bladder, kidney, and liver.  Conclusions:   Our results confirm that most prostate cancer survivors have lower risks of second cancers than expected, but the magnitude varied by race/ethnicity.

FBXL7 mediates the ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of active c-SRC after its phosphorylation at Ser 104. The DNA-demethylating agent decitabine recovers FBXL7 expression and limits epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cell invasion in a c-SRC-dependent manner. In vivo, FBXL7-depleted cancer cells form tumours with a high metastatic burden. Silencing of c-SRC or treatment with the c-SRC inhibitor dasatinib together with FBXL7 depletion prevents metastases.

The sub-fractions and the purified RBC3G inhibited epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) characteristics of PC3 cells by blocking the expression of several cytoskeletal associate proteins in a concentration dependent manner, leading to decreasing of the cancer cell motility. RBC3G reduced the expression of Smad/Snail signaling molecules but enhanced the expression of cell surface protein, E-cadherin, leading to a delay tumor transformation. The RBC3G also inhibited matrix metalloproteinase-9 and nuclear factor-kappa B expression levels and the enzymes activity in PC3 cells, leading to a slow cell migration/invasion process.

The development of hypofractionation practices in recent years tends to increase the workload of the stages of preparation for irradiation and to decrease the number of fractions per patient. The purpose of this retrospective study is to analyze the evolution of these practices in a single centre and to assess the organizational issues involved.  Material and methods:   All radiation therapy records management data were extracted from the Radiation Therapy Information System. Radiotherapy sessions were identified by patient and by ICD (International Classification of Diseases) code. The filling rate of the treatment equipment was calculated using actual data from the radiotherapy department.  Results:   From 2015 to 2019, there was an increase in the number of scans (+16%), the number of patients treated (+11.6%) and the volume of hours available for treatment (+12%). Also, there was a decrease in the total number of fractions (-5%), in the average number of fractions performed per treatment sequence (-19%), in the occupancy rate of the machines (-7%) and in the average number of fractions performed per patient treated for malignant tumours of the bronchi and lung (-38%), digestive organs (-37%), secondary (-19%) breast (-15%) and prostate (-15%). The number of fractions administered per treatment sequence between 2015 and 2019 decreased significantly for patients in age groups [20-69] (P<0.001) and [>70] (P<0.001).  Conclusion:   A paradox appears between the increase in the total number of patients treated and the decrease in the loading rate of linacs. This shift of workload has an impact on the quality and safety of care and on the organizational and investment strategies. It also has an economic impact where the model of reimbursement is based on per fraction pricing.

Combining these omics data can significantly increase the capability for recovering fine-tuned structures or reducing the effects of experimental and biological noise in data.  Results:   In this work we propose a multi-view integration methodology (named FH-Clust) for identifying patient subgroups from different omics information (e.g., Gene Expression, Mirna Expression, Methylation). In particular, hierarchical structures of patient data are obtained in each omic (or view) and finally their topologies are merged by consensus matrix. One of the main aspects of this methodology, is the use of a measure of dissimilarity between sets of observations, by using an appropriate metric. For each view, a dendrogram is obtained by using a hierarchical clustering based on a fuzzy equivalence relation with Łukasiewicz valued fuzzy similarity. Finally, a consensus matrix, that is a representative information of all dendrograms, is formed by combining multiple hierarchical agglomerations by an approach based on transitive consensus matrix construction. Several experiments and comparisons are made on real data (e.g., Glioblastoma, Prostate Cancer) to assess the proposed approach.  Conclusions:   Fuzzy logic allows us to introduce more flexible data agglomeration techniques. From the analysis of scientific literature, it appears to be the first time that a model based on fuzzy logic is used for the agglomeration of multi-omic data. The results suggest that FH-Clust provides better prognostic value and clinical significance compared to the analysis of single-omic data alone and it is very competitive with respect to other techniques from literature.""","""['Angelo Ciaramella', 'Davide Nardone', 'Antonino Staiano']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Bioinformatics""","""['Adaptive Fuzzy Consensus Clustering Framework for Clustering Analysis of Cancer Data.', 'Fuzzy ensemble clustering based on random projections for DNA microarray data analysis.', 'Hybrid fuzzy cluster ensemble framework for tumor clustering from biomolecular data.', 'Multi-omic and multi-view clustering algorithms: review and cancer benchmark.', 'Clustering approaches to identifying gene expression patterns from DNA microarray data.', 'A new biomarker panel of ultraconserved long non-coding RNAs for bladder cancer prognosis by a machine learning based methodology.', 'Heterogeneous data integration methods for patient similarity networks.']"""

Results:   Between May 2015 and June 2019, the medical records of 65 patients were collected. Of these patients, 38 (58.5%) received AA and 27 (41.5%) enzalutamide. Early PSA response rate (RR; ≥ 30% and ≥ 50% from baseline at the 4th week) was identified in 38.5% (n=25) and 15.3% (n=10) of the patients, respectively. In multivariate analysis, we found that PSA RR≥ 30% in patients had a statistically significant advantage in terms of PFS ( HR: 0.38, 95% CI (0.13-0.71;p=0.03).  Conclusion:   In conclusion, 30% PSA RR was significantly associated with a better PFS.""","""['Demir Atakan', 'Alan Ozkan', 'Mert Aslihan Guve', 'Koca Sinan']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J BUON""","""['Abiraterone acetate after progression with enzalutamide in chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a multi-center retrospective analysis.', 'Anticancer Activity and Tolerance of Treatments Received Beyond Progression in Men Treated Upfront with Androgen Deprivation Therapy With or Without Docetaxel for Metastatic Castration-naïve Prostate Cancer in the GETUG-AFU 15 Phase 3 Trial.', 'Independent association between time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir and PSA progression-free survival in patients with docetaxel-naïve, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer receiving abiraterone acetate, but not enzalutamide.', 'Evaluation of maintenance of the common androgen deprivation therapy with the new antiandrogen therapy in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Improving power in PSA response analyses of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer trials.', 'Early PSA Change after 177LuPSMA-617 Radioligand Therapy as a Predicator of Biochemical Response and Overall Survival.']"""

The associations of expressions of miR-135 and miR-92a with the pathological Gleason score and expression of prostate specific antigen (PSA) were assessed, the sensitivity and specificity of miR-135 and miR-92a in the diagnosis of prostate cancer were compared, and the associations between the expressions of miR-135 and miR-92a and the prognosis of prostate cancer patients were evaluated.  Results:   In patients with pathological Gleason score ≥8 points the expression level of miR-135 was significantly lower (p<0.05), while that of miR-92a was significantly higher than those in patients with pathological Gleason score <8 points (p<0.05). In patients with PSA expression >10 ng/mL the expression level of miR-135 was obviously lower (p<0.05), while that of miR-92a was obviously higher than those in patients with PSA expression ≤10 ng/mL (p<0.05). The expression of miR-135 was negatively correlated with the pathological Gleason score and PSA expression (p<0.05), while the expression of miR-92a was positively correlated with the pathological Gleason score and PSA expression (p<0.05). The sensitivity and specificity of miR-135 and miR-92a in the diagnosis were above 80% and about 70%, respectively. In miR-135-positive patients, the mean survival time was longer (p<0.05) and the 2-year survival rate was higher than those in miR-135-negative patients (p<0.05).

Using a novel dose accumulation workflow with iterative CBCT (iCBCT) images, we were able to validate treatment margins.  Methods:   Sixteen patients treated to the prostate on a hypofractionated clinical trial were selected. Prescription dose was 3625 cGy to > 95% of the PTV in 5 fractions with a boost to 4000 cGy to the high risk GTV (if applicable). PTV margin expansion was 5 mm isotropic except 3 mm posterior, no margin for the GTV. Daily iCBCT images were obtained while practicing strict bladder and rectal filling protocols. Using a novel adaptive dose accumulation workflow, synthetic CTs were created and the daily delivered dose was recalculated. The daily dose distributions were accumulated and target coverage and organ dose were assessed.  Results:   Although the PTV coverage dropped for the accumulated dose, the prostate coverage was not compromised. The differences in bladder and anorectum dose were not significantly different. Four patients received a boost to the GTV and a significant decrease in coverage was noted in the accumulated dose.  Conclusions:   The novel dose accumulation workflow demonstrated that daily iCBCT images can be used for dose accumulation. We found that our clinical treatment margins resulted in adequate dose to the prostate while sparing OARs. If the goal is to deliver the full dose to an intra-prostatic GTV, a margin may be appropriate.""","""['Matthew T Studenski', 'Rodrigo Delgadillo', 'Yihang Xu', 'Joseph Both', 'Kyle Padgett', 'Matthew Abramowitz', 'John C Ford', 'Alan Dal Pra', 'Alan Pollack', 'Nesrin Dogan']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Phys Med""","""['Dosimetric effects of adaptive prostate cancer radiotherapy in an MR-linac workflow.', 'Determination of optimal PTV margin for patients receiving CBCT-guided prostate IMRT: comparative analysis based on CBCT dose calculation with four different margins.', 'Evaluation of online/offline image guidance/adaptation approaches for prostate cancer radiation therapy.', 'The potential failure risk of the cone-beam computed tomography-based planning target volume margin definition for prostate image-guided radiotherapy based on a prospective single-institutional hybrid analysis.', 'The influence of the bowel and bladder preparation protocol for radiotherapy of prostate cancer using kilo-voltage cone beam CT: Our experience.', 'Assessment of CT to CBCT contour mapping for radiomic feature analysis in prostate cancer.', 'Adaptive replanning using cone beam CT for deformation of original CT simulation.', 'Direct visualization and correlation of liver stereotactic body radiation therapy treatment delivery accuracy with interfractional motion.']"""

A subsequent study showed no selection for carbapenem resistance, but antimicrobial stewardship concerns remained.  Aim:   To assess the effects of this prophylaxis on overall antibiotic consumption and exposure to the hospital environment.  Methods:   All men undergoing TRUS-PB from November 2006 to July 2019 were included. Hospital records of men presenting within 30 days of biopsy were searched to determine whether post-biopsy infection (PBI) occurred, antibiotic usage, and duration of hospitalization. Prophylaxis during the pre-ertapenem period (period 1: 2006 to 2012) was oral ciprofloxacin for three days, with oral amoxicillin-clavulanate added in 2009. During the subsequent period (period 2: 2012 to 2019) a single intramuscular dose of ertapenem was used.  Findings:   From periods 1 and 2, 1663 and 2357 men, respectively, were included. Median age was 65 years for both groups. Between periods 1 and 2, PBI incidence decreased from 2.65% to 0.34% (risk ratio: 0.13; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.06, 0.27), and PBI-related bacteraemia from 1.14% to 0.04% (0.04; 0.01, 0.22), with a single bacteraemia during period 2. PBI treatment antibiotic consumption decreased from 57.6 to 4.3 defined daily doses (DDDs) per 100 biopsies (mean difference: -53.3; 95% CI: -73.1, -33.5) and overall consumption (treatment plus prophylaxis) decreased from 580.8 to 104.3 DDDs per 100 biopsies (mean difference: -476.5). PBI-related hospitalized bed-days per 100 biopsies decreased from 9.44 to 0.89 (mean difference: -8.55; 95% CI: -12.31, -4.79).

Propensity score matching was used to assess for potential differences in outcomes by type of cancer status among contemporary (2012-2015) patients.  Results:   Overall, the utilization of CABG decreased over time (250,677 in 2003 vs 134,534 in 2015, P<.001). However, the proportion of those with comorbid cancer increased (7.0% vs 12.6%, P<.001). Over time, in-hospital mortality associated with CABG use in cancer remained unchanged (.9% vs 1.0%, P=.72); yet, cancer patients saw an increase in associated major bleeding (4.5% vs 15.3%, P<.001) and rate of stroke (.9% vs 1.5%, P<.001) over time. In-hospital cost-of-care associated with CABG-use in cancer also increased over time ($29,963 vs $33,636, P<.001). When stratified by cancer types, in-hospital mortality was not higher in breast, lung, prostate, colon cancer, or lymphoma versus non-cancer CABG patients (all P>.05).

Discharge dispositions were not found to be different between cancer sub-groups and non-cancer patients (P>.05), except for breast cancer patients who had lower home care, but higher skilled care disposition (P<.001).  Conclusion:   Among those undergoing CABG, the prevalence of comorbid cancer has steadily increased. Outside of major bleeding, these patients appear to share similar outcomes to those without cancer indicating that CABG utilization should be not be declined in cancer patients when otherwise indicated.

To verify the prostatic nature of the resultant glands, DHT-treated human fetal female urethral xenografts were compared with human fetal prostatic xenografts (derived from male specimens) grown in untreated and DHT-treated castrated mouse hosts and human fetal female proximal urethral xenografts grown in untreated castrated hosts. The resultant glands observed in DHT-treated human fetal female proximal urethral xenografts expressed 3 prostate-specific markers, NKX3.1, prostate specific antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase as well as the androgen receptor. Glands induced by DHT exhibited a protein expression profile of additional immunohistochemical markers (seven keratins, RUNX1, ESR2, TP63 and FOXA1) consistent with the unique spatial pattern of these proteins in prostatic ducts. Xenografts of human fetal female proximal urethra grown in DHT-treated hosts also expressed one of the salient features of prostatic development, namely androgen responsiveness. The experimental induction of prostatic differentiation from human fetal female proximal urethra makes possible future in-depth analysis of the molecular pathways directly involved in initiation of human prostatic development and subsequent epithelial differentiation, and more important whether the molecular pathways involved in human prostatic development are similar/identical versus different from that in murine prostatic development.""","""['Gerald R Cunha', 'Mei Cao', 'Omar Franco', 'Laurence S Baskin']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Differentiation""","""['Role of canine basal cells in prostatic post natal development, induction of hyperplasia, sex hormone-stimulated growth; and the ductal origin of carcinoma.', 'Role of canine basal cells in postnatal prostatic development, induction of hyperplasia, and sex hormone-stimulated growth; and the ductal origin of carcinoma.', '2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin inhibits luminal cell differentiation and androgen responsiveness of the ventral prostate without inhibiting prostatic 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone formation or testicular androgen production in rat offspring.', 'Development of the human prostate.', 'Progenitors in prostate development and disease.', 'Precision Targets for Intercepting the Lethal Progression of Prostate Cancer: Potential Avenues for Personalized Therapy.', 'A Review of Prostate Organogenesis and a Role for iPSC-Derived Prostate Organoids to Study Prostate Development and Disease.', 'Human urogenital sinus mesenchyme is an inducer of prostatic epithelial development.']"""

Results:   The ADC, Ktrans, Kep, and Ve values of bone metastases were significantly higher than those of benign red marrow depositions (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in LMR between the two groups (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.360). The AUCs of Ktrans, Kep, ADC, Ve, and LMR were 0.896, 0.844, 0.812, 0.724, and 0.448, respectively. In the pairwise comparison of ROC curves, the AUCs of Ktrans and Kep was significantly higher than LMR.

Nucleolin (NCL) has emerged as a possible biomarker of PCa due to its high expression levels in the surface of PCa cells and affinity towards parallel G4s since it contains four RNA-binding domains (RBDs). Herein, we developed a novel strategy based on a microfluidic platform for the detection of NCL in biological samples, such as human plasma. The RNA G4 (rG4) sequence found in human precursor microRNA 92b (pre-miR-92b) was used as a molecular recognition probe since it forms a single dominant parallel rG4 conformation in the presence of 0.1 mM K+ as confirmed by NMR spectroscopy. The additional stability of the rG4 structure was provided by the acridine orange derivative ligand C8, which stabilizes the pre-miR-92b rG4 structure, as denoted by an increase in more than 30 °C of its melting temperature. FRET-melting assay revealed a remarkable synergistic effect of NCL RBD1,2 and C8 on the stabilization of the pre-miR-92b rG4. The binding of pre-miR-92b to NCL RBD1,2 was determined by in silico studies, which revealed a binding pocket formed by a 12-residue linker between RBD1 and RBD2. Both, pre-miR-92b rG4 and pre-miR-92b rG4/C8 complex demonstrated high affinity towards NCL RBD1,2, as proved by fluorimetric titrations (KD range between 10-12 and 10-9 M). The stability and nuclease resistance of pre-miR-92b rG4 and pre-miR-92b rG4/C8 complex were evaluated as molecular recognition probes to capture and detect NCL. Finally, the microfluidic platform detects NCL in complex biological samples, such as human plasma. Overall, this work demonstrates the usefulness of the microfluidic platform based on the pre-miR-92b to detect NCL and the possibility to be used as a valuable biomedical tool in PCa diagnosis.""","""['Tiago Santos', 'André Miranda', 'Maria P C Campello', 'António Paulo', 'Gilmar Salgado', 'Eurico J Cabrita', 'Carla Cruz']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Biochem Pharmacol""","""['RNA G-quadruplex as supramolecular carrier for cancer-selective delivery.', 'Targeting nucleolin by RNA G-quadruplex-forming motif.', 'Targeting a G-quadruplex from let-7e pre-miRNA with small molecules and nucleolin.', 'New perspectives of physiological and pathological functions of nucleolin (NCL).', 'A Key Molecular Regulator, RNA G-Quadruplex and Its Function in Plants.', 'Assessment of Aptamer as a Potential Drug Targeted Delivery for Retinal Angiogenesis Inhibition.', 'Dasatinib: a potential tyrosine kinase inhibitor to fight against multiple cancer malignancies.', 'Impairment of Nucleolin Activity and Phosphorylation by a Trachylobane Diterpene from Psiadia punctulata in Cancer Cells.', 'Recent advances in applying G-quadruplex for SARS-CoV-2 targeting and diagnosis: A review.', 'Ligands as Stabilizers of G-Quadruplexes in Non-Coding RNAs.']"""

It has recently been described as a prognostic marker in many cancers. The present study aimed to investigate the immunohistochemical expression of CIP2A in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) and prostate cancer (PC), and to analyse the association with the clinicopathological parameters in PC cases to define its role in the development and progression of PC.  Materials and methods:   Immunohistochemical staining for CIP2A was performed on the tissue microarray sections of 105 PC, 27 HGPIN and 27 BPH tissues. The CIP2A expression scores were compared with several clinicopathological parameters.  Results:   CIP2A was expressed in 96,2% of PC, 55,6% of HGPIN and 40,7% of BPH tissues. The expression of CIP2A in PC was significantly higher than in HGPIN (p<0.0001) and BPH (p<0.0001) cases. CIP2A expression score was significantly associated with Gleason score (p=0.032) and lymphovascular invasion (p=0.039). Nevertheless, there was no statistically significant association between the expression of CIP2A and perineural invasion, pT stage, metastasis and recurrence (p>0.05). Multivariate analysis indicated that GS, lymphovascular invasion, distant metastasis were independent prognostic factors for PC patients but, CIP2A expression score was not found to be a prognostic factor. Additionally, there was no significant difference between the survival times of patients according to CIP2A expression (p=0.174).  Conclusions:   According to our results, the expression of CIP2A protein is increased in PC and its expression may be involved in the development, differentiation, and aggressiveness of PC.

A training cohort with 98 patients and a validation cohort with 72 patients were retrospectively recruited into our study. Immunohistochemical analysis was used to evaluate the immunoreactivity of a group of biomarkers in the initial negative biopsy normal-looking tissues of the training and validation cohorts. p-STAT3, Mcm2, and/or MSR1 were selected out of 10 biomarkers to construct a biomarker index for predicting cancer and high-grade prostate cancer (HGPCa) in the training cohort based on the stepwise logistic regression analysis; these biomarkers were then validated in the validation cohort. In the training cohort study, we found that the biomarker index was independently associated with the re-biopsy outcomes of cancer and HGPCa. Moreover supplementing the biomarker index with traditional clinical-pathological parameters can improve the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the model from 0.722 to 0.842 and from 0.735 to 0.842, respectively, for predicting cancer and HGPCa at re-biopsy. In the decision-making analysis, we found the model supplemented with the biomarker index can improve patients' net benefit. The application of the model to clinical practice, at a 10% risk threshold, would reduce the number of biopsies by 34.7% while delaying the diagnosis of 7.8% cancers and would reduce the number of biopsies by 73.5% while delaying the diagnosis of 17.8% HGPCas.

The aim of this study was to develop improved radiotherapeutic agents that combine an optimized affinity-modifying group and optimized albumin binders to maximize the tumor-to-kidney absorbed dose ratio. Methods:68Ga-labeled DOTA-conjugated lysine-ureido-glutamate-based PSMA-targeting agents bearing various affinity-modifying groups or albumin binders were synthesized and evaluated by PET/CT imaging and biodistribution studies in LNCaP tumor-bearing mice. The optimized affinity-modifying group and albumin binders were combined, and the resulting derivatives were radiolabeled with 177Lu and evaluated by SPECT/CT imaging and biodistribution studies in LNCaP tumor-bearing mice. Radiation dosimetry was calculated using the OLINDA/EXM software. Results: Affinity-modifying group optimization revealed that 68Ga-HTK03041 bearing a tranexamic acid-9-anthrylalanine affinity-modifying group had the highest tumor uptake (23.1 ± 6.11 percentage injected dose [%ID]/g at 1 h after injection).

To address this limitation, we cultured HR+ breast cancer and prostate cancer spheroids and patient-derived organoids in 3D extracellular matrices (ECM) alone or together with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC). In 3D monocultures, antiestrogens and antiandrogens induced anoikis by abrogating anchorage-independent growth of HR+ cancer cells but exhibited only modest effects against tumor cells residing in the ECM niche. In contrast, BMSC induced hormone-independent growth of breast cancer and prostate cancer spheroids and restored lumen filling in the presence of HR-targeting agents. Molecular and functional characterization of BMSC-induced hormone independence and HT resistance in anchorage-independent cells revealed distinct context-dependent mechanisms. Cocultures of ZR75-1 and LNCaP with BMSCs exhibited paracrine IL6-induced HT resistance via attenuation of HR protein expression, which was reversed by inhibition of IL6 or JAK signaling. Paracrine IL6/JAK/STAT3-mediated HT resistance was confirmed in patient-derived organoids cocultured with BMSCs. Distinctly, MCF7 and T47D spheroids retained ER protein expression in cocultures but acquired redundant compensatory signals enabling anchorage independence via ERK and PI3K bypass cascades activated in a non-IL6-dependent manner. Collectively, these data characterize the pleiotropic hormone-independent mechanisms underlying acquisition and restoration of anchorage-independent growth in HR+ tumors. Combined analysis of tumor and microenvironmental biomarkers in metastatic biopsies of HT-resistant patients can help refine treatment approaches.

Here we describe and demonstrate a novel machine-learning guided panel design strategy for improving the detection of tumor variants in cfDNA. Using this approach, we first generated a model to classify and score candidate variants for inclusion on a prostate cancer targeted sequencing panel. We then used this panel to screen tumor variants from prostate cancer patients with localized disease in both in silico and hybrid capture settings.  Methods:   Whole Genome Sequence (WGS) data from 550 prostate tumors was analyzed to build a targeted sequencing panel of single point and small (< 200 bp) indel mutations, which was subsequently screened in silico against prostate tumor sequences from 5 patients to assess performance against commonly used alternative panel designs. The panel's ability to detect tumor-derived cfDNA variants was then assessed using prospectively collected cfDNA and tumor foci from a test set 18 prostate cancer patients with localized disease undergoing radical proctectomy.  Results:   The panel generated from this approach identified as top candidates mutations in known driver genes (e.g. HRAS) and prostate cancer related transcription factor binding sites (e.g. MYC, AR). It outperformed two commonly used designs in detecting somatic mutations found in the cfDNA of 5 prostate cancer patients when analyzed in an in silico setting. Additionally, hybrid capture and 2500X sequencing of cfDNA molecules using the panel resulted in detection of tumor variants in all 18 patients of a test set, where 15 of the 18 patients had detected variants found in multiple foci.  Conclusion:   Machine learning-prioritized targeted sequencing panels may prove useful for broad and sensitive variant detection in the cfDNA of heterogeneous diseases. This strategy has implications for disease detection and monitoring when applied to the cfDNA isolated from prostate cancer patients.""","""['Clinton L Cario', 'Emmalyn Chen', 'Lancelote Leong', 'Nima C Emami', 'Karen Lopez', 'Imelda Tenggara', 'Jeffry P Simko', 'Terence W Friedlander', 'Patricia S Li', 'Pamela L Paris', 'Peter R Carroll', 'John S Witte']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Cell-Free DNA Detection of Tumor Mutations in Heterogeneous, Localized Prostate Cancer Via Targeted, Multiregion Sequencing.', 'Clinical determinants for successful circulating tumor DNA analysis in prostate cancer.', 'Machine learning enables detection of early-stage colorectal cancer by whole-genome sequencing of plasma cell-free DNA.', 'Using circulating cell-free DNA to monitor personalized cancer therapy.', 'Non-blood sources of cell-free DNA for cancer molecular profiling in clinical pathology and oncology.', 'Cell-free DNA in the management of prostate cancer: Current status and future prospective.', 'Identification of a Specific Biomarker of Acinetobacter baumannii Global Clone 1 by Machine Learning and PCR Related to Metabolic Fitness of ESKAPE Pathogens.', 'HotSPOT: A Computational Tool to Design Targeted Sequencing Panels to Assess Early Photocarcinogenesis.', 'Characteristics of Artificial Intelligence Clinical Trials in the Field of Healthcare: A Cross-Sectional Study on ClinicalTrials.gov.', 'Integrating chromatin accessibility states in the design of targeted sequencing panels for liquid biopsy.']"""

However, outcomes varied among institutions (from 0%-100% treatment success).  Purpose:   The aim of this study was to identify patient selection, technical treatment, and imaging parameters that predict successful pain relief of osseous metastases after MRI-guided focused US.  Materials and methods:   This was a secondary analysis of a phase 3 clinical study that included participants who received MRI-guided focused US treatment for painful osseous metastases. Noncontrast CT was obtained before treatment. T2-weighted and T1-weighted postcontrast MRIs at 1.5 T or 3 T were obtained before, at the time of, and at 3 months after treatment. Numerical Rating Scale pain scores and morphine equivalent daily dose data were obtained over a 3-month follow-up period. At the 3-month endpoint, participants were categorized as pain relief responders or nonresponders based on Numerical Rating Scale and morphine equivalent daily dose data. Demographics, technical parameters, and imaging features associated with pain relief were determined using stepwise univariable and multivariable models. Responder rates between the subgroup of participants with all predictive parameters and that with none of the parameters were compared using Fisher exact test.  Results:   The analysis included 99 participants (mean age, 59 ± 14 years; 56 women). The 3 variables that predicted successful pain relief were energy density on the bone surface (EDBS) (P = 0.001), the presence of postprocedural periosteal devascularization (black band, BB+) (P = 0.005), and female sex (P = 0.02). The subgroup of participants with BB+ and EDBS greater than 5 J/mm2 had a larger decrease in mean pain score (5.2; 95% confidence interval, 4.6-5.8) compared with those without (BB-, EDBS ≤ 5 J/mm2) (1.1; 95% confidence interval, 0.8-3.0; P < 0.001). Participants with all 3 predictive variables had a pain relief responder rate of 93% compared with 0% in participants having none of the predictive variables (P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   High EDBS during treatment, postprocedural periosteal devascularization around the tumor site (BB+), and female sex increased the likelihood of pain relief after MRI-guided focused US of osseous metastasis.""","""['Rachel R Bitton', 'Jarrett Rosenberg', 'Suzanne LeBlang', 'Alessandro Napoli', 'Joshua Meyer', 'Kim Butts Pauly', 'Mark Hurwitz', 'Pejman Ghanouni']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Invest Radiol""","""['Magnetic Resonance-Guided High-Intensity-Focused Ultrasound for Palliation of Painful Skeletal Metastases: A Pilot Study.', 'Mid-term efficacy grading evaluation and predictive factors of magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery for painful bone metastases: a multi-center study.', 'Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound for patients with painful bone metastases: phase III trial results.', 'MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound for treatment of bone metastasis.', 'Radiofrequency ablation of osseous metastases for the palliation of pain.', 'Focused Ultrasound and RadioTHERapy for non-invasive palliative pain treatment in patients with bone metastasis: a study protocol for the three armed randomized controlled FURTHER trial.', 'Therapeutic US Applications for the Abdomen and Pelvis.', 'Synthetic CT for the planning of MR-HIFU treatment of bone metastases in pelvic and femoral bones: a feasibility study.']"""

Previous reports indicated a functional interaction between this receptor and the protein Annexin A1, which has also been associated with aggressive tumors. The molecular pathogenesis of castration-resistant prostate cancer remains largely unresolved, and herein we have demonstrated the correlation between the expression levels and localization of the epidermal growth factor receptor and Annexin A1 in prostate cancer samples and cell lines. Interestingly, a higher expression of both proteins was detected in castration-resistant prostate cancer cell lines and the strongest correlation was seen at the nuclear level. We verified that Annexin A1 interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor, and by using prostate cancer cell lines knocked down for Annexin A1, we succeeded in demonstrating that Annexin A1 promotes the nuclear localization of epidermal growth factor receptor. Finally, we showed that Annexin A1 activates an autocrine signaling in castration-resistant prostate cells through the formyl peptide receptor 1. The inhibition of such signaling by Cyclosporin H inhibits the nuclear localization of epidermal growth factor receptor and its downstream signaling. The present work sheds light on the functional interaction between nuclear epidermal growth factor receptor and nuclear Annexin A1 in castration-resistant prostate cancer. Therefore, strategies to inhibit the nuclear localization of epidermal growth factor receptor through the suppression of the Annexin A1 autocrine loop could represent an important intervention strategy for castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Sara Teixeira Soares Mota', 'Lara Vecchi', 'Douglas Alexsander Alves', 'Antonielle Oliveira Cordeiro', 'Gabriela Silva Guimarães', 'Esther Campos-Fernández', 'Yara Cristina Paiva Maia', 'Bruno de Carvalho Dornelas', 'Stephania Martins Bezerra', 'Victor Piana de Andrade', 'Luiz Ricardo Goulart', 'Thaise Gonçalves Araújo']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Biochem Cell Biol""","""['Suppression of TRPM7 Inhibited Hypoxia-Induced Migration and Invasion of Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer Cells by Enhancing RACK1-Mediated Degradation of HIF-1α.', 'NDRG2 acts as a negative regulator downstream of androgen receptor and inhibits the growth of androgen-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Patient-derived Hormone-naive Prostate Cancer Xenograft Models Reveal Growth Factor Receptor Bound Protein 10 as an Androgen Receptor-repressed Gene Driving the Development of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor: what we know and what we expect in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Non-Coding RNAs in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Regulation of Androgen Receptor Signaling and Cancer Metabolism.', 'Comprehensive analysis the diagnosis, malignant progression and immune infiltrate of ANXA6 in prostate cancer.', 'Glyphosate and Aminomethylphosphonic Acid (AMPA) Modulate Glutathione S-Transferase in Non-Tumorigenic Prostate Cells.', ""Downregulated annexin A1 expression correlates with poor prognosis, metastasis, and immunosuppressive microenvironment in Ewing's sarcoma."", 'Interleukin-6 Signaling in Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cells Elicits the Annexin A1/Formyl Peptide Receptor 1 Axis and Affects the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Choosing Kinase Inhibitors for Androgen Deprivation Therapy-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   We assessed consistency in AE reporting, AE risk in placebo arms, and methodology used for risk estimates and quantification of statistical uncertainty in randomized placebo-controlled phase III trials of apalutamide, enzalutamide, and darolutamide in advanced prostate cancer.  Results:   Seven included clinical trials enrolled a total of 9215 participants (range = 1051-1715 per trial) across 3 prostate cancer disease states. Within disease states, baseline patient characteristics appeared similar between trials. Of 54 distinct AE types in total, only 3 (fatigue, hypertension, and seizure) were reported by all 7 trials. Absolute risks of AEs in the placebo arms differed systematically and more than twofold between trials, which was associated with visit frequency and resulted in different degrees of uncertainty in AE profiles between trials. No trial used inferential methodology to quantify statistical uncertainty in AE risks, but 6 of 7 trials drew overall conclusions. Two trials concluded that there was no elevated AE risk because of the intervention, including the trial of darolutamide, which had the greatest statistical uncertainty.  Conclusions:   Rigorous comparison of drug safety was precluded by heterogeneity in AE reporting, variation in AE risks in the placebo arms, and lack of inferential statistical methodology, underscoring considerable opportunities to improve how AE data are collected, analyzed, and interpreted in oncology trials.""","""['Joshua Z Drago', 'Mithat Gönen', 'Gita Thanarajasingam', 'Chana A Sacks', 'Michael J Morris', 'Philip W Kantoff', 'Konrad H Stopsack']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst""","""['Indirect Comparison of Darolutamide versus Apalutamide and Enzalutamide for Nonmetastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Evaluation of Clinically Relevant Drug-Drug Interactions and Population Pharmacokinetics of Darolutamide in Patients with Nonmetastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Results of Pre-Specified and Post Hoc Analyses of the Phase III ARAMIS Trial.', 'Behavioral and Pharmacotherapy Weight Loss Interventions to Prevent Obesity-Related Morbidity and Mortality in Adults: An Updated Systematic Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Cognition and depression effects of androgen receptor axis-targeted drugs in men with prostate cancer: A systematic review.', 'Comparative efficacy of apalutamide darolutamide and enzalutamide for treatment of non-metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer: A systematic review and network meta-analysis.', 'Functional impact of androgen-targeted therapy on patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Matching-adjusted indirect treatment comparison of the efficacy of enzalutamide versus apalutamide for the treatment of nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Anxiety and Coping Stress Strategies in Researchers During COVID-19 Pandemic.', 'Apalutamide, Darolutamide and Enzalutamide for Nonmetastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (nmCRPC): A Critical Review.', 'Advancing Assessment, Analysis, and Reporting of Safety and Tolerability in Cancer Trials.']"""

However, while many studies focus on vitamin D's role in cell metabolism, the effect of chronically low vitamin D levels on bone tissue, i.e. insufficient mineralization of the tissue, has largely been ignored. To investigate, whether poor tissue mineralization promotes cancer cell attachment, we used a fluorescence based adhesion assay and single cell force spectroscopy to quantify the adhesion of two prostate cancer cell lines to well-mineralized and demineralized dentin, serving as biomimetic bone model system. Adhesion rates of bone metastases-derived PC3 cells increased significantly on demineralized dentin. Additionally, on mineralized dentin, PC3 cells adhered mainly via membrane anchored surface receptors, while on demineralized dentin, they adhered via cytoskeleton-anchored transmembrane receptors, pointing to an interaction via exposed collagen fibrils. The adhesion rate of lymph node derived LNCaP cells on the other hand is significantly lower than that of PC3 and not predominately mediated by cytoskeleton-linked receptors. This indicates that poor tissue mineralization facilitates the adhesion of invasive cancer cells by the exposure of collagen and emphasizes the disease modifying effect of sufficient vitamin D for cancer patients.""","""['Ediz Sariisik', 'Domenik Zistl', 'Denitsa Docheva', 'Arndt F Schilling', 'Martin Benoit', 'Stefanie Sudhop', 'Hauke Clausen-Schaumann']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Decoding Cytoskeleton-Anchored and Non-Anchored Receptors from Single-Cell Adhesion Force Data.', 'MV-mimicking micelles loaded with PEG-serine-ACP nanoparticles to achieve biomimetic intra/extra fibrillar mineralization of collagen in vitro.', 'Effect of collagen I and fibronectin on the adhesion, elasticity and cytoskeletal organization of prostate cancer cells.', 'Aspects of collagen mineralization in hard tissue formation.', 'Vitamin D endocrinology of bone mineralization.', 'Selection of lncRNAs That Influence the Prognosis of Osteosarcoma Based on Copy Number Variation Data.', 'In vitro engineering of a bone metastases model allows for study of the effects of antiandrogen therapies in advanced prostate cancer.']"""

The aim of this study was to examine the potential association between the forensic STR markers located at four regions Xp22.31, Xq11.2-12, Xq26.2, and Xq28 and the risk of BPH and PrCa to confirm the impact of ChrX in the PrCa incidence.

Methods:   A population-based cohort study was conducted of all 699,125 Swedish military conscripts during 1972-1985 (97%-98% of 18-year-old men) in relation to risk of prostate cancer overall, aggressive prostate cancer, and prostate cancer mortality during 1998-2017 (ages 50-65 years).

Results:   In 38.8 million person-years of follow-up, 10,782 (1.5%) men were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Adjusting for sociodemographic factors, height, weight, and family history of prostate cancer, high CRF was associated with a slightly increased risk of any prostate cancer [highest vs. lowest quintile: incidence rate ratio (IRR), 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.19; P = 0.008], but was neither significantly associated with aggressive prostate cancer (1.01; 0.85-1.21; P = 0.90) nor prostate cancer mortality (1.24; 0.73-2.13; P = 0.42).

We have investigated the cancer risk up to the third degree of relation in families with pediatric cancer to reveal patterns of inheritance.  Methods:   A single-center cohort of 757 patients with pediatric cancer was linked to the Swedish National Population Register, resulting in 16,137 relatives up to the third degree of relation. All relatives were matched to the Swedish Cancer Register, and standard incidence ratios (SIR) were calculated to define relatives at risk.  Results:   Children and adults up to the third degree of relation had increased cancer risk, with SIRs of 1.48 (P = 0.01) and 1.07 (P < 0.01), respectively. The SIRs for first- and third-degree adult relatives were 1.22 and 1.10, respectively, but no increased risk was observed in second-degree relatives. Male relatives had a higher risk than females, especially when related to a girl and when the child had leukemia. The risk was mainly increased for lung, prostate, and gastrointestinal cancer. When excluding 29 families of children with known pathogenic germline variants, the increased risk remained.  Conclusions:   Relatives to children with cancer up to third degree of relation have an increased cancer risk. Known pathogenic germline variants do not explain this increased risk.

Whether this is the result of less screening in Asian men remains to be determined. We examined whether Asian race was associated with prostate cancer diagnosis in the Reduction by Dutasteride of Cancer Events (REDUCE) study.  Methods:   REDUCE was a 4-year, multicenter, randomized trial of dutasteride versus placebo for prostate cancer prevention among men who underwent prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-independent biopsies at 2 and 4 years. Eligible men were ages 50 to 75 years, had PSA between 2.5 and 10 ng/mL, and a negative prestudy prostate biopsy. We tested the association between Asian and Caucasian race and prostate cancer diagnosis using logistic regression.  Results:   Of 8,122 men in REDUCE, 5,755 (71%) were Caucasian and 105 (1.8%) were Asian. Asians had lower body mass index (24.8 vs. 26.9 kg/m2, P < 0.001), had smaller prostate volume (35.0 vs. 43.5 cc, P < 0.001), and were less likely to have abnormal digital rectal exams (P = 0.048), but were similar in baseline age, PSA, family history of prostate cancer, and smoking status compared with Caucasian men (all P ≥ 0.164). Asian men were equally likely to receive any on-study biopsy compared with Caucasian men (P = 0.634). After adjusting for potential confounders, Asian men were less likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer during the 4-year study (OR = 0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.28-0.88; P = 0.016), compared with Caucasian men.  Conclusions:   In REDUCE, where all men underwent biopsies largely independent of PSA, Asian race was associated with lower prostate cancer diagnosis.

However, there is lacking systematical assessment of stemlike indices and associations with immunological properties in prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD). We thus collected 7 PRAD cohorts with 1465 men and calculated the stemlike indices for each sample using one-class logistic regression machine learning algorithm. We selected the mRNAsi to quantify the stemlike indices that correlated significantly with prognosis and accordingly identified 21 PCS-related CpG loci and 13 pivotal signature. The 13-gene based PCS model possessed high predictive significance for progression-free survival (PFS) that was trained and validated in 7 independent cohorts. Meanwhile, we conducted consensus clustering and classified the total cohorts into 5 PCS clusters with distinct outcomes. Samples in PCScluster5 possessed the highest stemness fractions and suffered from the worst prognosis. Additionally, we implemented the CIBERSORT algorithm to infer the differential abundance across 5 PCS clusters. The activated immune cells (CD8+ T cell and dendritic cells) infiltrated significantly less in PCScluster5 than other clusters, supporting the negative regulations between stemlike indices and anticancer immunity. High mRNAsi was also found to be associated with up-regulation of immunosuppressive checkpoints, like PDL1. Lastly, we used the Connectivity Map (CMap) resource to screen potential compounds for targeting PRAD stemness, including the top hits of cell cycle inhibitor and FOXM1 inhibitor.

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapy in DDR-mutant (DDRmut) mCRPC.  Methods:   We assessed response to platinum chemotherapy based on DDR gene alteration status in men with mCRPC who underwent tumor and germline genomic profiling. Patients with deleterious alterations in a gene panel that included BRCA2, BRCA1, ATM, PALB2, FANCA, and CDK12 were considered DDRmut.  Results:   A total of 109 patients with mCRPC received platinum-based chemotherapy between October 2013 and July 2018. Sixty-four of 109 patients were taxane refractory and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) naïve. Within this subset, DDRmut was found in 16/64 patients (25%) and was associated with an increased likelihood of achieving a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline of 50% or more from baseline (PSA50; odds ratio, 7.0; 95% CI, 1.9 to 29.2). Time on platinum chemotherapy tended to be longer in the DDRmut group (median, 3.0 v 1.6 months; hazard ratio, 0.55, 95% CI, 0.29 to 1.24). No difference in survival was detected. Of 8 patients with DDRmut disease who received platinum-based therapy after a PARPi, 3/7 evaluable patients had radiographic partial response or stable disease, and 2/7 had a PSA50 response. None of 4 patients with ATM mutations had platinum responses regardless of prior PARPi exposure.  Conclusion:   Patients with DDRmut disease had better response to platinum-based chemotherapy, suggesting that DDR status warrants prospective validation as a potential biomarker for patient selection.

EZH2 is upregulated or mutated in most cancers, and its expression levels are negatively associated with clinical outcomes. However, the current developed small-molecule inhibitors targeting EZH2 enzymatic activities could not inhibit the growth and progression of solid tumors. Here, we discovered an antihistamine drug, ebastine, as a novel EZH2 inhibitor by targeting EZH2 transcription and subsequently downregulating EZH2 protein level and H3K27 trimethylation in multiple cancer cell lines at concentrations below 10 μmol/L. The inhibition of EZH2 by ebastine further impaired the progression, migration, and invasiveness of these cancer cells. Overexpression of Ezh2 wild-type and its mutant, H689A (lacking methyltransferase activity), rescued the neoplastic properties of these cancer cells after ebastine treatment, suggesting that EZH2 targeted by ebastine is independent of its enzymatic function. Next-generation RNA-sequencing analysis also revealed that C4-2 cells treated with 8 μmol/L ebastine showed a gene profiling pattern similar to EZH2-knockdown C4-2 cells, which was distinctively different from cells treated with GSK126, an EZH2 enzyme inhibitor. In addition, ebastine treatment effectively reduced tumor growth and progression, and enhanced progression-free survival in triple-negative breast cancer and drug-resistant castration-resistant prostate cancer patient-derived xenograft mice.

A model compound, [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-AmBz-MVK(Ac)-OH (AmBz: aminomethylbenzoyl), and its derivative, [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-AmBz-MVK(HTK01166)-OH, coupled with the PSMA (prostate-specific membrane antigen)-targeting motif of the previously reported HTK01166 were synthesized and evaluated to determine if they could be recognized and cleaved by the renal brush border enzymes. Additionally, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, ex vivo biodistribution and in vivo stability studies were conducted in mice to evaluate their pharmacokinetics. [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-AmBz-MVK(Ac)-OH was effectively cleaved specifically by neutral endopeptidase (NEP) of renal brush border enzymes at the Met-Val amide bond, and the radio-metabolite [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-AmBz-Met-OH was rapidly excreted via the renal pathway with minimal kidney retention.

A share of 83 % of all patients with unilateral prostate cancer diagnosed by biopsy have lymph node metastases on one side (ipsilateral or contralateral); 75 % of those patients have exclusively ipsilateral metastases. The results of using HistoScanning as a diagnostic instrument are not convincing. The histopathological analysis after prostatectomy showed tumour growth in both prostate lobes in 89 % of the patients.  Conclusion:   Both biopsy and HistoScanning seem to underestimate the tumour spread in the prostate. Due to this inaccuracy, a recommendation to restrict lymphadenectomy to one side cannot be given although some significant correlation has been found.""","""['Debora Niemann', 'Claudius Hamann', 'Klaus-Peter Jünemann', 'Stephanie Knüpfer', 'Daniar Osmonov']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Aktuelle Urol""","""['The role of side-specific biopsy and dominant tumor location at radical prostatectomy in predicting the side of nodal metastases in organ confined prostate cancer: is lymphatic spread really unpredictable?', 'Extended pelvic lymphadenectomy in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy: high incidence of lymph node metastasis.', 'Preoperative multiparametric MRI of the prostate for the prediction of lymph node metastases in prostate cancer patients treated with extended pelvic lymph node dissection.', 'Pelvic lymph node dissection in prostate cancer.', 'Update on histopathological evaluation of lymphadenectomy specimens from prostate cancer patients.']"""

PSMA PET imaging has been introduced in the diagnostic work-up of PC with high accuracy, but is currently mainly utilised in the setting of biochemical recurrence. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of combined 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/mpMRI imaging to detect PC in patients with previously negative prostate biopsies.  Methods:   A total of 57 patients who had undergone at least one prior negative prostate biopsy were included in this retrospective analysis. All patients underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/mpMRI imaging of the prostate. mpMRI was evaluated according to the PIRADS classification system and 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET was rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1: PC highly unlikely; 2: PC unlikely; 3: presence of PC is equivocal; 4: PC likely; 5: PC highly likely). All patients received a systematic random biopsy as well as a targeted transrectal biopsy of lesions suspicious on imaging. Imaging and histological biopsy outcomes were compared on a per-patient basis.  Results:   In the histological analysis, 35/57 (61.4 %) patients harboured PC lesions. In patients with biopsy-proven PC, 21/35 (60.0 %) had a PI-RADS 4 or 5 lesion on mpMRI and 28 /35 (80.0 %) had a PET rating of 4 or 5. Combined 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/mpMRI missed only one patient with a Gleason score (GS) 7a tumour (rating of 1 or 2 in both PET and mpMRI). Limitations include the retrospective analysis as well as possible false negative biopsy results even in a fusion biopsy setting.  Conclusion:   In this initial analysis, the combined 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/mpMRI proved to be a valuable imaging tool to guide prostate biopsies for the detection of PC in patients with a negative prior biopsy. In this approach, 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET and mpMRI show partially complementary findings that enhance the detection of PC lesions.""","""['Tobias Maurer', 'Hannah Gesterkamp', 'Noemi Nguyen', 'Kay Westenfelder', 'Jürgen E Gschwend', 'Lars Budäus', 'Isabel Rauscher', 'Tibor Vag', 'Wolfgang Weber', 'Matthias Eiber']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Aktuelle Urol""","""['Intraindividual comparison between 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT and mpMRI for intraprostatic tumor delineation in patients with primary prostate cancer: a retrospective analysis in 101 patients.', 'Histological comparison between predictive value of preoperative 3-T multiparametric MRI and 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan for pathological outcomes at radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection for prostate cancer.', '68Ga-PSMA PET/CT better characterises localised prostate cancer after MRI and transperineal prostate biopsy: Is 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT guided biopsy the future?', 'Diagnostic Performance and Clinical Impact of PSMA PET/CT versus mpMRI in Patients with a High Suspicion of Prostate Cancer and Previously Negative Biopsy: A Prospective Trial (PROSPET-BX).', 'PET-CT and PET-MRI of the prostate : From 18F-FDG to 68Ga-PSMA.']"""

Patients and methods:   We relied on PCa patients who opted for active surveillance and underwent elastography targeted and systematic follow-up biopsy at the Braunschweig Prostate Cancer Center between October 2009 and February 2015. Each prostate sextant was considered as an individual case. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy (ACC) for elastography to predict follow-up biopsy results were analyzed, respectively, and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were carried out by using 2000 bootstrapping sample analyses.  Results:   Overall, 50 men and 300 sextants were identified. Overall, 27 (54%) men and 66 (22%) sextants harbored PCa at follow-up biopsy.

Methods:   The gene expression profiles of GSE70768 were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. A total of 13 CRPC samples and 110 tumor samples were identified. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, and the gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG) enrichment analysis was performed. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network module analysis was constructed and performed in Cytoscape software. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was conducted to determine hub genes involved in the development and progression of CRPC. The gene expression profiles of GSE80609 were used for validation.  Results:   A total of 1738 DEGs were identified, consisting of 962 significantly down-regulated DEGs and 776 significantly upregulated DEGs for the subsequent analysis. GO term enrichment analysis suggested that DEGs were mainly enriched in the extracellular matrix organization, extracellular exosome, extracellular matrix, and extracellular space. KEGG pathway analysis found DEGs significantly enriched in the focal adhesion pathway. PPI network demonstrated that the top 10 hub genes were ALB, ACACB, KLK3, CDH1, IL10, ALDH1A3, KLK2, ALDH3B2, HBA1, COL1A1. Also, WGCNA identified the top 5 hub genes in the turquoise module, including MBD4, BLZF1, PIP5K2B, ZNF486, LRRC37B2.

Traditional clinicopathological parameters still are effective predictors for prognosis. Comparison of 23-set, seven-step immune activity scores, and its distribution between favorable and adverse outcome groups within each cancer type and among cancer types show that each cancer has a distinct tumor-immune pattern. Adjusted overall immune activity scores based on the binary logistic regression analysis show a great discrimination ability in the progression-free survival (p = .0056 in BLCA, p < .0001 in KIRC, and p < .0001 in PRAD). K-mean cluster method and principal component analysis were performed to explore the cancer subtype. The results reveal that certain immune activity scores pattern such as high nature killer (NK) cell, T cell, macrophage, T helper type 1 (Th1) cell, and dendritic cell recruiting scores in BLCA, low NK cell, CD8 T cell, macrophage, T cell, Th1 cell recruiting scores in KIRC have a favorable clinical outcome comparing to other subtypes.

Methods:   Participants were 5545 European-ancestry men, including 2775 nonaggressive and 2770 aggressive PCa cases, which included 467 metastatic cases (16.9%). Samples were assembled from 12 international studies and germline sequenced together. Rare (minor allele frequency < 0.01) P/LP/D variants were analyzed for 155 DNA repair genes. We compared single variant, gene-based, and DNA repair pathway-based burdens by disease aggressiveness. All statistical tests are 2-sided.  Results:   BRCA2 and PALB2 had the most statistically significant gene-based associations, with 2.5% of aggressive and 0.8% of nonaggressive cases carrying P/LP/D BRCA2 alleles (odds ratio [OR] = 3.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.94 to 5.25, P = 8.58 × 10-7) and 0.65% of aggressive and 0.11% of nonaggressive cases carrying P/LP/D PALB2 alleles (OR = 6.31, 95% CI = 1.83 to 21.68, P = 4.79 × 10-4). ATM had a nominal association, with 1.6% of aggressive and 0.8% of nonaggressive cases carrying P/LP/D ATM alleles (OR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.10 to 3.22, P = .02). In aggregate, P/LP/D alleles within 24 literature-curated candidate PCa DNA repair genes were more common in aggressive than nonaggressive cases (carrier frequencies = 14.2% vs 10.6%, respectively; P = 5.56 × 10-5). However, this difference was non-statistically significant (P = .18) on excluding BRCA2, PALB2, and ATM. Among these 24 genes, P/LP/D carriers had a 1.06-year younger diagnosis age (95% CI = -1.65 to 0.48, P = 3.71 × 10-4).

Methods:   We investigated language functions among 182 patients with different types of cancer (not brain cancer) and compared them with the performance of Greek healthy adults with the same age and educational levels as the patients. The assessment included verbal fluency test, both semantic (animals) and phonological (X), and Boston Naming Test (BNT-60) among other neuropsychological measures.  Results:   Breast cancer patients performed worse compared to patients with prostate, colorectal and thyroid cancer in language tasks.

Our aim was to extract a radiomic signature from axial T2-weighted (T2-W) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the whole prostate able to predict oncological and radiological scores in prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   This study included 65 patients with localized PCa treated with radiotherapy (RT) between 2014 and 2018. For each patient, the T2-W MRI images were normalized with the histogram intensity scale standardization method. Features were extracted with the IBEX software. The association of each radiomic feature with risk class, T-stage, Gleason score (GS), extracapsular extension (ECE) score, and Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS v2) score was assessed by univariate and multivariate analysis.  Results:   Forty-nine out of 65 patients were eligible. Among the 1702 features extracted, 3 to 6 features with the highest predictive power were selected for each outcome. This analysis showed that texture features were the most predictive for GS, PI-RADS v2 score, and risk class; intensity features were highly associated with T-stage, ECE score, and risk class, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) ranging from 0.74 to 0.94.  Conclusions:   MRI-based radiomics is a promising tool for prediction of PCa characteristics. Although a significant association was found between the selected features and all the mentioned clinical/radiological scores, further validations on larger cohorts are needed before these findings can be applied in the clinical practice.  Key points:   • A radiomic model was used to classify PCa aggressiveness. • Radiomic analysis was performed on T2-W magnetic resonance images of the whole prostate gland. • The most predictive features belong to the texture (57%) and intensity (43%) domains.""","""['Simone Giovanni Gugliandolo#', 'Matteo Pepa#', 'Lars Johannes Isaksson#', 'Giulia Marvaso', 'Sara Raimondi', 'Francesca Botta', 'Sara Gandini', 'Delia Ciardo', 'Stefania Volpe', 'Giulia Riva', 'Damari Patricia Rojas', 'Dario Zerini', 'Paola Pricolo', 'Sarah Alessi', 'Giuseppe Petralia', 'Paul Eugene Summers', 'Frnacesco Alessandro Mistretta', 'Stefano Luzzago', 'Federica Cattani', 'Ottavio De Cobelli', 'Enrico Cassano', 'Marta Cremonesi', 'Massimo Bellomi', 'Roberto Orecchia', 'Barbara Alicja Jereczek-Fossa']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Machine learning-based radiomic models to predict intensity-modulated radiation therapy response, Gleason score and stage in prostate cancer.', 'Prostate Cancer Differentiation and Aggressiveness: Assessment With a Radiomic-Based Model vs. PI-RADS v2.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Radiomics Based on MRI as a Biomarker to Guide Therapy by Predicting Upgrading of Prostate Cancer From Biopsy to Radical Prostatectomy.', 'The role of radiomics in prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Multiparametric MRI radiomics in prostate cancer for predicting Ki-67 expression and Gleason score: a multicenter retrospective study.', 'Value of handcrafted and deep radiomic features towards training robust machine learning classifiers for prediction of prostate cancer disease aggressiveness.', 'The Use of MRI-Derived Radiomic Models in Prostate Cancer Risk Stratification: A Critical Review of Contemporary Literature.', 'Quality assurance for automatically generated contours with additional deep learning.', 'Radiomics in prostate cancer: an up-to-date review.']"""

However, active surveillance requires repeated assessments, including prostate-specific antigen tests and biopsies that may increase anxiety, risk of complications, and cost.  Objective:   To identify and validate clinical parameters that can identify men who can safely defer follow-up prostate cancer assessments.  Design, setting, and participants:   The Canary Prostate Active Surveillance Study (PASS) is a multicenter, prospective active surveillance cohort study initiated in July 2008, with ongoing accrual and a median follow-up period of 4.1 years. Men with prostate cancer managed with active surveillance from 9 North American academic medical centers were enrolled. Blood tests and biopsies were conducted on a defined schedule for least 5 years after enrollment. Model validation was performed among men at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) who did not enroll in PASS. Men with Gleason grade group 1 prostate cancer diagnosed since 2003 and enrolled in PASS before 2017 with at least 1 confirmatory biopsy after diagnosis were included. A total of 850 men met these criteria and had adequate follow-up. For the UCSF validation study, 533 active surveillance patients meeting the same criteria were identified. Exclusion criteria were treatment within 6 months of diagnosis, diagnosis before 2003, Gleason grade score of at least 2 at diagnosis or first surveillance biopsy, no surveillance biopsy, or missing data.  Exposures:   Active surveillance for prostate cancer.  Main outcomes and measures:   Time from confirmatory biopsy to reclassification, defined as Gleason grade group 2 or higher on subsequent biopsy.  Results:   A total of 850 men (median [interquartile range] age, 64 [58-68] years; 774 [91%] White) were included in the PASS cohort. A total of 533 men (median [interquartile range] age, 61 [57-65] years; 422 [79%] White) were included in the UCSF cohort. Parameters predictive of reclassification on multivariable analysis included maximum percent positive cores (hazard ratio [HR], 1.30 [95% CI, 1.09-1.56]; P = .004), history of any negative biopsy after diagnosis (1 vs 0: HR, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.38-0.71]; P < .001 and ≥2 vs 0: HR, 0.18 [95% CI, 0.08-0.4]; P < .001), time since diagnosis (HR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.28-2.05]; P < .001), body mass index (HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.05-1.12]; P < .001), prostate size (HR, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.25-0.62]; P < .001), prostate-specific antigen at diagnosis (HR, 1.51 [95% CI, 1.15-1.98]; P = .003), and prostate-specific antigen kinetics (HR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.23-1.73]; P < .001). For prediction of nonreclassification at 4 years, the area under the receiver operating curve was 0.70 for the PASS cohort and 0.70 for the UCSF validation cohort. This model achieved a negative predictive value of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.83-0.94) for those in the bottom 25th percentile of risk and of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.89-1.00) for those in the bottom 10th percentile.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this study, among men with low-risk prostate cancer, heterogeneity prevailed in risk of subsequent disease reclassification.

A plethora of literature evidence points out that increased O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT) enzyme level/hyper-O-GlcNAcylation has direct implications in development of cancer and interferes with clinical outcomes of chemotherapy via interaction with oncogenic factors. The aim of this research was to evaluate the combination approach of anticancer drugs with an OGT inhibitor (OSMI-1) as an alternative way to resolve issues in the treatment of prostate cancer and assess the benefits offered by this approach. Effect of combination of doxorubicin and docetaxel with OSMI-1 on drug-induced cell death and synergism/antagonism was investigated using resazurin assay. Reduction in OGT enzyme level was evaluated using ELISA kit. Caspase-3/7 fluorescence assay was performed to detect apoptosis induction in PC-3 cells after treatment with the combinations of doxorubicin and OGT inhibitor to further understand the mechanism of cell death by concomitant treatment. Studies reveal that combination approach is indeed effective in terms of reducing the half-maximum growth inhibition value of doxorubicin when concomitantly treated with OSMI-1 and has synergistic effect in prostate cancer cells. PC-3 cells exhibited elevated levels of OGT enzyme in comparison to WPMY-1, and OSMI-1 has potential to inhibit OGT enzyme significantly. Data show that OSMI-1 alone and in combination with doxorubicin reduces OGT enzyme level significantly accompanied by increased apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Combination of doxorubicin with OSMI-1 reduced the elevated OGT level which led to a drastic increase in sensitivity of PC-3 cells toward doxorubicin in comparison to doxorubicin alone.

Inhibition of these two pathways further decreases expression of Sp1 by inhibiting Sp1 gene transcription, induces degradation of Sp1 protein by inhibiting GSK3β phosphorylation, suppresses nucleolin-enhanced translation of Sp1 mRNA by inhibiting nucleolin phosphorylation, and directly inactivates transcription activity of Sp1. Inhibition of Sp1 subsequently decreases the expression of Sp3/4, VEGF, and Survivin and then upregulates apoptosis-related proteins and downregulates cell cycle-related proteins in PCa cells.

Many glandular epithelia develop from multipotent basal stem cells (BSCs) that are replaced in adult life by distinct pools of unipotent stem cells1,3-8. However, adult unipotent BSCs can reactivate multipotency under regenerative conditions and upon oncogene expression3,9-13. This suggests that an active mechanism restricts BSC multipotency under normal physiological conditions, although the nature of this mechanism is unknown. Here we show that the ablation of LCs reactivates the multipotency of BSCs from multiple epithelia both in vivo in mice and in vitro in organoids. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that, after LC ablation, BSCs activate a hybrid basal and luminal cell differentiation program before giving rise to LCs-reminiscent of the genetic program that regulates multipotency during embryonic development7. By predicting ligand-receptor pairs from single-cell data14, we find that TNF-which is secreted by LCs-restricts BC multipotency under normal physiological conditions. By contrast, the Notch, Wnt and EGFR pathways were activated in BSCs and their progeny after LC ablation; blocking these pathways, or stimulating the TNF pathway, inhibited regeneration-induced BC multipotency.

We sought to evaluate cancer risk among workers employed in occupations and industries with these exposures as part of an ongoing surveillance programme in Ontario, Canada.  Methods:   The Occupational Disease Surveillance System (ODSS) cohort was established using workers' compensation claims data and includes 2.18 million workers employed from 1983 to 2014. Workers were followed for site-specific cancer diagnoses in the Ontario Cancer Registry through 2016. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate adjusted HR and 95% CI.  Results:   We identified 81 127 workers employed in plastics and rubber manufacturing industries or materials processing and product fabricating occupations. Compared with all other women in the ODSS, those in materials processing occupations had an elevated rate of lung cancer (HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.58) that was not observed among men. An elevated rate of breast cancer was observed among female labourers (HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.82) and moulders (HR 1.47, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.37) in plastics and rubber product fabricating occupations. Overall, elevated rates were observed for oesophageal, liver, stomach, prostate and kidney cancer in job-specific subgroups, including mixing and blending, bonding and cementing, and labouring. There was little evidence of association for lymphatic or haematopoietic cancers.  Conclusions:   Findings for lung and breast cancer in women are consistent with other studies and warrant further attention in Ontario. Given the relatively young age at end of follow-up, surveillance in these workers should continue as the cohort ages.""","""['Nathan L DeBono', 'Chlöe Logar-Henderson', 'Hunter Warden', 'Sharara Shakik', 'Mamadou Dakouo', 'Jill MacLeod', 'Paul A Demers']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Occup Environ Med""","""['Prostate cancer risk by occupation in the Occupational Disease Surveillance System (ODSS) in Ontario, Canada.', 'Incidence of mesothelioma and asbestosis by occupation in a diverse workforce.', 'Incidence of acute myocardial infarction in the workforce: Findings from the Occupational Disease Surveillance System.', 'Meta-analysis of occupational exposures in the rubber manufacturing industry and risk of cancer.', 'Cancer by industry: analysis of a population-based cancer registry with an emphasis on blue-collar workers.', 'Breast Cancer Incidence among Female Workers by Different Occupations and Industries: A Longitudinal Population-Based Matched Case-Control Study in Taiwan.']"""

In this work, we further characterized the expression pattern of PEG10 in The Cancer Genome Atlas database of 412 patients with MIBC, and found that, compared with other subtypes, PEG10 mRNA level was enhanced in neuroendocrine-like MIBC and highly correlated with other neuroendocrine markers. PEG10 protein level also associated with neuroendocrine markers in a tissue microarray of 82 cases. In bladder cancer cell lines, PEG10 expression was induced in drug-resistant compared with parental cells, and knocking down of PEG10 resensitized cells to chemotherapy. Loss of PEG10 increased protein levels of cell-cycle regulators p21 and p27 and delayed G1-S-phase transition, while overexpression of PEG10 enhanced cancer cell proliferation. PEG10 silencing also lowered levels of SLUG and SNAIL, leading to reduced invasion and migration. In an orthotopic bladder cancer model, systemic treatment with PEG10 antisense oligonucleotide delayed progression of T24 xenografts.

Characterization of the activity of CB-03-10 and its main related compound CB-03-05 (cortexolone 17α-valerate) included in vitro binding to the androgen and glucocorticoid receptors (AR and GR), antagonism of AR and GR transcriptional activities, and screening for antitumor activity across a selected panel of human prostate and in triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. CB-03-10 cytotoxic activity in these cancer cell lines was in the low micromolar range and was primarily associated with induction of the apoptotic cascade via activation of caspases. The compound's potential for antitumor activity was verified in a murine xenograft model utilizing the AR-positive LNCaP prostate cancer cell line as well as in an orthotopic model utilizing AR-negative/GR-positive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. Orally administered CB-03-10 inhibited prostate tumor growth and orthotopically implanted breast tumor growth in these mice and maintained body weight, as compared with vehicle-treated mice. On the basis of AR/GR binding affinities, antagonism of androgen and glucocorticoid-dependent transcriptional activities, and AR/GR mRNA and protein expression, the mechanism of tumor growth suppression is related to AR and GR antagonist activities. Importantly, these compounds lack biologically relevant AR/GR agonist activities. Overall, these preclinical findings support the selection of CB-03-10 for further development as an anticancer agent in cases where resistance to AR-targeted therapy or chemotherapy, via upregulation of GR activity, continues to limit the efficacy and duration of clinical benefit with these interventions.""","""['Caridad Rosette', 'Frances J Agan', 'Niccolette Rosette', 'Alessandro Mazzetti', 'Luigi Moro', 'Mara Gerloni']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Glucocorticoid receptor activity contributes to resistance to androgen-targeted therapy in prostate cancer.', 'Differential targeting of androgen and glucocorticoid receptors induces ER stress and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells: a novel therapeutic modality.', 'Targeting the PI3K/AKT Pathway Overcomes Enzalutamide Resistance by Inhibiting Induction of the Glucocorticoid Receptor.', 'Interference with the androgen receptor protein stability in therapy-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor antagonists for prostate cancer therapy.', 'Preclinical models of prostate cancer - modelling androgen dependency and castration resistance in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo.', 'Computationally guided discovery of novel non-steroidal AR-GR dual antagonists demonstrating potency against antiandrogen resistance.', 'From Therapy Resistance to Targeted Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'Stress sensing within the breast tumor microenvironment: how glucocorticoid receptors live in the moment.']"""

However, more than half of patients do not respond to docetaxel, and those good responders frequently experience significant cumulative toxicity, which limits its dose duration and intensity. Hence, a second agent that could increase the initial efficacy of docetaxel and maintain tolerability at biologically effective doses may improve outcomes for patients.  Experimental design:   We determined phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) expression levels in human and genetically engineered mouse (GEM) prostate tissues and tumor-derived cell lines. Furthermore, we investigated the therapeutic benefits and underlying mechanism of PDE5 inhibitor sildenafil in combination with docetaxel using in vitro, Pten conditional knockout (cKO), derived tumoroid and xenograft prostate cancer models.  Results:   PDE5 expression was higher in both human and mouse prostate tumors and cancer cell lines compared with normal tissues/cells. In GEM prostate-derived cell lines, PDE5 expression increased from normal prostate (wild-type) epithelial cells to androgen-dependent and castrated prostate-derived cell lines. The addition of physiologically achievable concentrations of sildenafil enhanced docetaxel-induced prostate cancer cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in vitro, reduced murine 3D tumoroid growth, and in vivo tumorigenicity as compared with docetaxel alone. Furthermore, sildenafil enhanced docetaxel-induced NO and cGMP levels thereby augmenting antitumor activity.  Conclusions:   Our results demonstrate that sildenafil's addition could sensitize docetaxel chemotherapy in prostate cancer cells at much lesser concentration than needed for inducing cell death. Thus, the combinatorial treatment of sildenafil and docetaxel may improve anticancer efficacy and reduce chemotherapy-induced side-effects among patients with advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Sakthivel Muniyan', 'Satyanarayana Rachagani', 'Seema Parte', 'Sushanta Halder', 'Parthasarathy Seshacharyulu', 'Prakash Kshirsagar', 'Jawed A Siddiqui', 'Raghupathy Vengoji', 'Sanchita Rauth', 'Ridwan Islam', 'Kavita Mallya', 'Kaustubh Datta', 'Lei Xi', 'Anindita Das', 'Benjamin A Teply', 'Rakesh C Kukreja', 'Surinder K Batra']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['KLF5 downregulation desensitizes castration-resistant prostate cancer cells to docetaxel by increasing BECN1 expression and inducing cell autophagy.', 'Dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 sensitizes docetaxel in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'The Effects and Mechanism of YK-4-279 in Combination with Docetaxel on Prostate Cancer.', 'PIM1 kinase as a target in prostate cancer: roles in tumorigenesis, castration resistance, and docetaxel resistance.', 'Phosphodiesterase type 5 as a pharmacologic target in erectile dysfunction.', 'Functional Axis of PDE5/cGMP Mediates Timosaponin-AIII-Elicited Growth Suppression of Glioblastoma U87MG Cells.', '3D Tumor Models in Urology.', 'Androgen-deprivation therapy with leuprolide increases abdominal adiposity without causing cardiac dysfunction in middle-aged male mice: effect of sildenafil.', 'Application of single-point prostate biopsy in elderly patients with highly suspected prostate cancer.', 'Editorial: Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer: Prognosis and Treatment.']"""

Objective:   To develop a risk tool predicting BCR after RP in patients diagnosed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-targeted biopsy.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 804 patients with a clinical suspicion of PCa and positive mpMRI diagnosed with MRI-targeted plus concomitant systematic biopsy treated with RP were identified.  Outcome measurements and statistical analyses:   The outcome was represented by BCR defined as two prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values ≥0.2ng/ml after surgery. Multivariable Cox regression analyses assessed the predictors of BCR. A risk tool model based on imaging and biopsy parameters was developed and validated internally. The c-index, calibration plot, and decision curve analyses were used to assess discrimination, calibration, and the net benefit associated with its use in predicting BCR at 36 mo.  Results and limitations:   Median (interquartile range) follow-up was 28 (25-29) mo, and 89 patients experienced BCR. The 36-mo BCR-free survival rate was 89%. The maximum diameter of the index lesion and seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) at mpMRI as well as the presence of clinically significant PCa at systematic biopsy (defined as a grade group of >2) were associated with BCR (all p≤0.03). A model based on PSA, Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System score, SVI at mpMRI, diameter of the index lesion, grade group at MRI-targeted biopsy, and clinically significant PCa at systematic biopsy achieved the highest discrimination (77%) among all clinical models, as well as the European Association of Urology risk groups (62%) and the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score (60%). This tool was characterized by excellent calibration at internal validation and the highest net benefit when predicting BCR for the threshold risk between 0% and 30%.  Conclusions:   The adoption of predictive models accounting for mpMRI and MRI-targeted biopsy-derived variables and concomitant systematic biopsy would improve clinicians' ability to identify patients at a higher risk of early recurrence after surgery.  Patient summary:   The use of information obtained at multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), and MRI-targeted and concomitant systematic biopsy would improve clinicians' ability to identify prostate cancer patients at a higher risk of experiencing early biochemical recurrence after surgery.""","""['Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Guillaume Ploussard', 'Massimo Valerio', 'Giancarlo Marra', 'Marco Moschini', 'Alberto Martini', 'Mathieu Roumiguié', 'Nicola Fossati', 'Armando Stabile', 'Jean-Baptiste Beauval', 'Bernard Malavaud', 'Simone Scuderi', 'Francesco Barletta', 'Luca Afferi', 'Arnas Rakauskas', 'Paolo Gontero', 'Agostino Mattei', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Alberto Briganti']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['Re: Giorgio Gandaglia, Guillaume Ploussard, Massimo Valerio, et al.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been the primary therapeutic approach for treatment of prostate cancer. However,nearly all patients develop the castration-resistant disease . We evaluated real-world data with abiraterone and enzalutamide treatment. By this data, we aimed to analyze whether that prior short response to ADT could predict response to subsequent therapy with androgen receptor axis targeted agent (ARATA).  Material and method:   We collected data from two cancer centers, 151 consecutive patients with treated abiraterone or enzalutamide in the first line of metastatic castration resistant prostat cancer (mCRPC) setting were included. The patients who received docetaxel in castration naive setting is also included. Time to castration resistance (TTCR) was defined as the duration from the initial to failure of primary ADT.  Results:   Patients with treated ARATA were divided into two groups according to the time to castration resistance (TTCR). Patients who became resistant to ADT up to one year had a median PFS of 6.6 months, compared to median PFS of 13.3 months for patients who responded ADT for more than 1 year. (p = 0.002). In the post-docetaxel setting, median PFS is 12.6 months of patients with treated ARATA who had TTCR for more than one year, and median PFS is 6.6 months in those who had TTCR less than one year (p = 0.007).Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the clinical factors on ARATA outcomes. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status(PS), median prostate-specific antigen(PSA) and time to CRPC were significantly predicted outcomes of ARATA on multivariate analysis.

AKR1C3 also contributes to androgen-independent cell proliferation and survival through the metabolism of prostaglandins and reactive aldehydes. Because of its elevation in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) tissues, AKR1C3 is a promising therapeutic target for CRPC. In this study, we found a novel potent AKR1C3 inhibitor, N-(4-fluorophenyl)-8-hydroxy-2-imino-2H-chromene-3-carboxamide (2d), and synthesized its derivatives with IC50 values of 25-56 nM and >220-fold selectivity over other AKRs (1C1, 1C2, and 1C4). The structural factors for the inhibitory potency were elucidated by crystallographic study of AKR1C3 complexes with 2j and 2l. The inhibitors suppressed proliferation of prostate cancer 22Rv1 and PC3 cells through both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent mechanisms. Additionally, 2j and 2l prevented prostate tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model. Furthermore, the inhibitors significantly augmented apoptotic cell death induced by anti-CRPC drugs (abiraterone or enzalutamide).""","""['Satoshi Endo', 'Hiroaki Oguri', 'Jin Segawa', 'Mina Kawai', 'Dawei Hu', 'Shuang Xia', 'Takuya Okada', 'Katsumasa Irie', 'Shinya Fujii', 'Hiroaki Gouda', 'Kazuhiro Iguchi', 'Takuo Matsukawa', 'Naohiro Fujimoto', 'Toshiyuki Nakayama', 'Naoki Toyooka', 'Toshiyuki Matsunaga', 'Akira Ikari']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Med Chem""","""['AKR1C3 Inhibitor KV-37 Exhibits Antineoplastic Effects and Potentiates Enzalutamide in Combination Therapy in Prostate Adenocarcinoma Cells.', 'A Mansonone Derivative Coupled with Monoclonal Antibody 4D5-Modified Chitosan Inhibit AKR1C3 to Treat Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Potent and selective aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3) inhibitors based on the benzoisoxazole moiety: application of a bioisosteric scaffold hopping approach to flufenamic acid.', 'Aldo-Keto Reductase (AKR) 1C3 inhibitors: a patent review.', 'AKR1C3 (type 5 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/prostaglandin F synthase): Roles in malignancy and endocrine disorders.', 'Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Coumarin Triazoles as Dual Inhibitors of Cholinesterases and β-Secretase.', 'Influence of aldo-keto reductase 1C3 polymorphisms in early-onset female psoriasis patients.', 'Inhibition of castration-resistant prostate cancer growth by genistein through suppression of AKR1C3.', 'Antiandrogenic Effects of a Polyphenol in Carex kobomugi through Inhibition of Androgen Synthetic Pathway and Downregulation of Androgen Receptor in Prostate Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Computational modeling studies reveal the origin of the binding preference of 3-(3,4-di hydroisoquinolin-2(1H)-ylsulfonyl)benzoic acids for AKR1C3 over its isoforms.']"""

In our study, we aimed to compare the survival outcomes of radical prostatectomy (RP) versus external beam radiotherapy (EBRT).We conducted analyses with a large cohort of 38,544 patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (2004-2016). Propensity score matching, Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox proportional hazard regression were used to reduce the influence of bias and compare the overall survival (OS) and cancer specific survival (CSS). Several different sensitivity analyses including inverse probability of treatment weighting and standardized mortality ratio weighting were used to verify the robustness of the results.Totally, 33,388 men received RP and 5,156 men received EBRT with cT3-4N0M0 PCa were included in this study. According to the Kaplan-Meier curves, RP performed better in both OS and CSS compared with EBRT (P < .0001). In the adjusted multivariate Cox regression, RP also showed better OS and CSS benefits (OS: HR=0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.46-0.54; P < .0001 and CSS: HR=0.43; 95% CI: 0.38-0.49; P < .0001). After propensity score matching, RP is still the management that can bring more survival benefits to patients. (OS: HR=0.46; 95% CI: 0.41-0.51; P < .0001 and CSS: HR = 0.41; 95% CI: 0.34-0.48; P < .0001).Our research demonstrated the significantly better survival benefits of RP over EBRT in patients with locally advanced PCa. The results of this study will provide more evidence to help clinicians choose appropriate treatment strategies.""","""['Xianghong Zhou', 'Kun Jin', 'Shi Qiu', 'Di Jin', 'Xinyang Liao', 'Xiang Tu', 'Xiaonan Zheng', 'Jiakun Li', 'Lu Yang', 'Qiang Wei']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Radiation therapy compared to radical prostatectomy as first-line definitive therapy for patients with high-risk localised prostate cancer: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The Prognosis of Radical Prostatectomy, External Beam Radiotherapy plus Brachytherapy, and External Beam Radiotherapy Alone for Patients above 70 Years with Very High-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Population-Matched Study.', 'Survival Outcomes of Men with Lymph Node-positive Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy: A Comparative Analysis of Different Postoperative Management Strategies.', 'Survival after radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy for locally advanced (cT3) prostate cancer.', 'Radical Prostatectomy versus External Beam Radiotherapy for cT1-4N0M0 Prostate Cancer: Comparison of Patient Outcomes Including Mortality.', 'Radiation therapy compared to radical prostatectomy as first-line definitive therapy for patients with high-risk localised prostate cancer: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""
