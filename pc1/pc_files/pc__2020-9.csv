The new systems have proved their ability to interact with biological molecules such as Human Serum Albumin (HSA) without affecting its secondary structure and erythrocytes membranes, causing haemolysis in a dose and generation dependent way. The combination of two active functional groups in one single dendritic platform has shown a cooperative effect in the viability of HeLa and PC-3 cells, with the second generation derivative standing out as the most promising with the lowest IC50. Experiments focused on advanced prostate cancer have shown an antimetastasic activity for those metallodendrons, hindering the adhesion of cells in one of the main targets of metastasis, bones, and inhibiting cell migration. Finally, the second generation metallodendron with one single metal centre and four dimethylamino groups on the dendritic wedge, was selected for an ex vivo experiment in nude mice with advanced prostate cancer inhibiting the tumour growth in a 40% compared to control mice.""","""['Natalia Sanz Del Olmo', 'Marta Maroto-Diaz', 'Sara Quintana', 'Rafael Gómez', 'Marcin Holota', 'Maksim Ionov', 'Maria Bryszewska', 'M José Carmena', 'Paula Ortega', 'F Javier de la Mata']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Eur J Med Chem""","""['Cyclopentadienyl ruthenium(II) carbosilane metallodendrimers as a promising treatment against advanced prostate cancer.', 'Synthesis and anticancer activity of carbosilane metallodendrimers based on arene ruthenium(ii) complexes.', 'Ruthenium dendrimers against acute promyelocytic leukemia:\xa0in vitro studies on HL-60 cells.', 'Tracking antitumor metallodrugs: promising agents with the Ru(II)- and Fe(II)-cyclopentadienyl scaffolds.', 'Arene Ruthenium(II) Complexes with Phosphorous Ligands as Possible Anticancer Agents.', 'The Spicy Science of Dendrimers in the Realm of Cancer Nanomedicine: A Report from the COST Action CA17140 Nano2Clinic.', 'Alteration of the HIF-1α/VEGF Signaling Pathway and Disruption of the Cell Cycle by Second Generation Carbosilan Dendrimers.', 'Amphiphilic Triazine-Phosphorus Metallodendrons Possessing Anti-Cancer Stem Cell Activity.', 'Ruthenium Complexes as Anticancer Agents: A Brief History and Perspectives.']"""

There is a need to investigate the survival outcome of metastatic prostate cancers separately. Also, the treatments undertaken by the patients affect their overall survival. The present study tries to analyze the sequence of treatments given to the patients, along with the time intervals between each set of treatments. The time when medication needs to be changed may provide some useful insights into the survival outcome of the patients.  Materials and methods:   A total of 407 metastatic prostate cancer patients' data was collected and analyzed from an Indian tertiary care center. Popular sequence mining algorithms with exact order constraint have been applied to the treatment data. Appropriate time intervals were added in the resulted frequent sequences and fed to machine learning techniques along with other clinical data.  Results:   The study suggests that the proposed methodology of the time range based sequence mining approach gave better results than the existing methods with 84.5% accuracy and 0.89 AUC. The time intervals in the existing sequence mining algorithms can give the clinicians some useful insights into the survival analysis and in determining the best lines of treatments for a particular patient.""","""['Ishleen Kaur', 'M N Doja', 'Tanvir Ahmad']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Biomed Inform""","""['An Integrated \u2009Approach for Cancer Survival Prediction Using Data Mining Techniques.', 'Application of a novel machine learning framework for predicting non-metastatic prostate cancer-specific mortality in men using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.', 'Machine learning application for incident prostate adenocarcinomas automatic registration in a French regional cancer registry.', 'Data-driven modeling and prediction of blood glucose dynamics: Machine learning applications in type 1 diabetes.', 'Machine learning and data mining frameworks for predicting drug response in cancer: An overview and a novel in silico screening process based on association rule mining.', 'Construction of machine learning-based models for cancer outcomes in low and lower-middle income countries: A scoping review.', 'An Integrated \u2009Approach for Cancer Survival Prediction Using Data Mining Techniques.', 'Systemic immune-inflammation index is a promising non-invasive biomarker for predicting the survival of urinary system cancers: a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

However, information on the overall functions of RBPs in prostate cancer (PCa) remains largely understudied. Therefore, based on the TCGA dataset, this study identified 144 differentially expressed RBPs in tumors compared to normal tissues. Subsequently, through univariate, LASSO and multivariate Cox regression analysis, 6 RBP genes among them, MSI1, MBNL2, LENG9, REXO2, RNASE1, and PABPC1L were screened as prognostic hub genes and prognostic signature was further identified. Further analysis indicated that the high-risk group was significantly associated with poor RFS, which was validated in the MSKCC cohort. Besides, patients in the high-risk group were closely associated with dysregulation of DNA damage repair pathway, copy number alteration, tumor burden mutation, and low-response to cisplatin (P < 0.001), and bicalutamide (P < 0.001). Using the Connectivity Map, we finally predicted 3 drugs including, ribavirin, carmustine, and carbenoxolone.

Recent data from multiple sources suggests that different tests may provide different risk estimates at the individual patient level. There is an increasing need for robust methods to support cost effective comparisons of test performance in multiple settings. The derivation of similar risk classifications using genes comprising the following multi-parametric tests Oncotype DX® (Genomic Health.), Prosigna™ (NanoString Technologies, Inc.), MammaPrint® (Agendia Inc.) was performed using different computational approaches. Results were compared to the actual test results. Two widely used approaches were applied, firstly computational ""modelling"" of test results using published algorithms and secondly a ""training"" approach which used reference results from the commercially supplied tests. We demonstrate the potential for errors to arise when using a ""modelling"" approach without reference to real world test results. Simultaneously we show that a ""training"" approach can provide a highly cost-effective solution to the development of real-world comparisons between different multigene signatures. Comparisons between existing multiparametric tests is challenging, and evidence on discordance between tests in risk stratification presents further dilemmas. We present an approach, modelled in breast cancer, which can provide health care providers and researchers with the potential to perform robust and meaningful comparisons between multigene tests in a cost-effective manner. We demonstrate that whilst viable estimates of gene signatures can be derived from modelling approaches, in our study using a training approach allowed a close approximation to true signature results.""","""['John M S Bartlett', 'Jane Bayani', 'Elizabeth N Kornaga', 'Patrick Danaher', 'Cheryl Crozier', 'Tammy Piper', 'Cindy Q Yao', 'Janet A Dunn', 'Paul C Boutros', 'Robert C Stein;OPTIMA Trial Management Group']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Comparative survival analysis of multiparametric tests-when molecular tests disagree-A TEAM Pathology study.', 'Cost effectiveness of gene expression profiling for early stage breast cancer: a decision-analytic model.', 'Diagnostic tests based on gene expression profile in breast cancer: from background to clinical use.', 'Systematic review: gene expression profiling assays in early-stage breast cancer.', 'Molecular profiling assays in breast cancer: are we ready for prime time?', 'Evaluation of multiple transcriptomic gene risk signatures in male breast cancer.', 'Comparative survival analysis of multiparametric tests-when molecular tests disagree-A TEAM Pathology study.']"""

De-novo intra-tumoral steroid synthesis is a suggested biological mechanism of castration resistant PCa, but the regulators are unknown. Testicular T production is controlled by the luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor (LHCGR). To elucidate the influence of LHCGR on PCa development the presence and effects of LHCGR in PCa and whether LHCGR in serum holds prognostic information in PCa patients is investigated. LHCGR expression was investigated by RT-PCR, WB, IHC, qPCR in PCa cell lines and prostatic tissue. Steroid production was measured in media from cell lines with LC-MS/MS and expression of steroidogenic enzymes with qPCR. Serum LHCGR (sLHCGR) was measured with ELISA in PCa patients (N = 157). Presence of LHCGR was established in prostatic tissue and PCa cell lines. Cell proliferation increased by 1.29-fold in LNCaP (P = 0.007) and 1.33-fold in PC-3 cells (P = 0.0007), when stimulated by luteinizing hormone. Choriogonadotropin stimulation decreased proliferation 0.93-fold in DU145 cells (P = 0.05), but none of the treatments altered steroid metabolite secretion. Low sLHCGR concentration was associated with a higher risk of biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy (HR = 3.05, P = 0.06) and castration resistance (HR = 6.92, P = 0.004) compared to high sLHCGR concentration. LHCGR is expressed in PCa and may exert a growth regulatory role in PCa derived cell lines. A potential prognostic role of sLHCGR for determining recurrence risk in PCa patients is found in this pilot study but needs verification in larger cohorts.""","""['Hein Vincent Stroomberg', 'Anne Jørgensen', 'Klaus Brasso', 'John Erik Nielsen', 'Anders Juul', 'Hanne Frederiksen', 'Martin Blomberg Jensen', 'Martin Andreas Røder']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Maternal smoking and developmental changes in luteinizing hormone (LH) and the LH receptor in the fetal testis.', 'Functional analysis of recombinant single-chain Japanese eel Fsh and Lh produced in FreeStyle 293-F cell lines: Binding specificities to their receptors and differential efficacy on testicular steroidogenesis.', 'Possible Relevance of Soluble Luteinizing Hormone Receptor during Development and Adulthood in Boys and Men.', 'Structural and functional plasticity of the luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotrophin receptor.', 'Luteinizing hormone and human chorionic gonadotropin: origins of difference.', 'Reply to RE: Should LHRH therapy be continued in patients receiving Abiraterone Acetate?', 'Effects of whole-body vibration on reproductive physiology in a rat model of whole-body vibration.', 'Statins Lower Lipid Synthesis But Promote Secretion of Cholesterol-Enriched Extracellular Vesicles and Particles.']"""

Many G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) and their ligands are also activated in these cells indicating that they may play a role in development of Prostate Cancer (PCa) and CRPC. Although a cross talk has been suggested between the two pathways, yet, the identity of GPCRs which may play a role in androgen signaling, is not established yet. By using blast analysis of 826 GPCRs, we identified a GPCR, GPCR 205, which exhibited maximum similarity with the ligand binding domain of the AR. We demonstrate that adhesion GPCR 205, also known as GPR56, can be activated by androgens to stimulate the Rho signaling pathway, a pathway that plays an important role in prostate tumor cell metastasis. Testosterone stimulation of GPR56 also activates the cAMP/ Protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, that is necessary for AR signaling. Knocking down the expression of GPR56 using siRNA, disrupts nuclear translocation of AR and transcription of prototypic AR target genes such as PSA. GPR56 expression is higher in all twenty-five prostate tumor patient's samples tested and cells expressing GPR56 exhibit increased proliferation.

When this is coupled with deregulated expression of the intracellular lipid-binding proteins FABP5 and CRABP2 that is frequently found in PC, this is likely to result in the preferential delivery of ATRA to oncogenic PPARβ/δ rather than retinoic acid receptors (RARs). There are three isotypes of RARs (RARα, RARβ, and RARγ) and recent studies have revealed discrete physiological roles. For example, RARα and RARγ promote differentiation and self-renewal, respectively, which are critical for proper hematopoiesis.  Aims:   We have previously shown that ATRA stimulates transactivation of RARγ at sub-nanomolar concentrations (EC50 0.24 nM), whereas an 80-fold higher concentration was required for RARα-mediated transactivation (EC50 19.3 nM). Additionally, we have shown that RAR pan-antagonists inhibit the growth of PC cells (at 16-34 nM). These findings, together with the low level of ATRA in PC, led us to hypothesize that RARγ plays a role in PC pathogenesis and that RARγ-selective antagonism may be an effective treatment.  Methods and results:   We found that concentrations of 10-9 M and below of ATRA promoted survival/proliferation and opposed adipogenic differentiation of human PC cell lines by a mechanism that involves RARγ. We also found that a RARγ-selective antagonist (AGN205728) potently induced mitochondria-dependent, but caspase-independent, cell death in PC cell lines. Furthermore, AGN205728 demonstrated synergism in killing PC cells in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.

Aims:   The goal of the study was to identify a simple analytical method for the postsalvage radiation therapy biochemical failure (post-SRTBF) prediction before the end of the SRT, regardless of the PSA value at the beginning of the treatment (PSA start), measuring the PSA values at the start and 1 week before the end of SRT.  Methods:   In a series of 83 patients treated with SRT for BF of Pca we measured PSA values at the first day and 1 week before the end of SRT. These values were used to define an analytical method for the post-SRTBF prediction.  Results:   PSA value in patients without post-SRTBF show a significant difference in term of difference during the SRT with respect to patients with post-SRTBF. Starting from this difference, we identified a simple and practical analytical method for the post-SRTBF prediction before the end of the SRT. The data corresponds with the model and the analytical method is highly predictive (Sensitivity = 81%, Specificity = 85%, Accuracy = 83%).  Conclusion:   This study offers a new tool to early predict Pca relapse overtime and to select patients who can benefit from an early additional systemic treatment.""","""['Riccardo Vigna-Taglianti', 'Alberto Boriano', 'Luca Gianello', 'Antonella Melano', 'Fabrizio Bergesio', 'Anna Maria Merlotti', 'Alessia Reali', 'Rachele Petrucci', 'Elvio G Russi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Rep (Hoboken)""","""['Salvage radiotherapy in prostate cancer patients with biochemical relapse after radical prostatectomy : Prolongation of prostate-specific antigen doubling time in patients with subsequent biochemical progression.', 'Outcome after conformal salvage radiotherapy in patients with rising prostate-specific antigen levels after radical prostatectomy.', 'Long-term Outcome of Prostate Cancer Patients Who Exhibit Biochemical Failure Despite Salvage Radiation Therapy After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Use of androgen deprivation and salvage radiation therapy for patients with prostate cancer and biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy.', 'Early salvage radiotherapy following radical prostatectomy.', 'Induction of IDO1 and Kynurenine by Serine Proteases Subtilisin, Prostate Specific Antigen, CD26 and HtrA: A New Form of Immunosuppression?']"""

However, its clinical utility for assessing skeletal metastatic burden is limited due to the need for subjective interpretation. We designed and tested a novel custom software tool, the Metastatic Bone Scan Tool (MetsBST), aimed at improving interpretation of IBSs, and compared its performance with that of an established software programme.  Methods:   We used IBS images from 62 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer and suspected bone metastases to design and implement MetsBST in MATLAB by defining thresholds used to identify the texture and size of metastatic bone lesions. The results of MetsBST were compared with those of the commercially available automated Bone Scan Index (aBSI) with regression analysis.  Results:   There was strong agreement between the MetsBST and aBSI results (R2 = 0.9189). In a subregional analysis, MetsBST quantified the extent of metastatic disease in multiple bone sites in patients receiving multimodality therapy (radium-223 and external beam radiotherapy) to illustrate the differences in bone metastatic response to different treatments.  Conclusion:   The results of MetsBST and the commercial software aBSI were highly consistent. MetsBST introduces novel clinical utility by its ability to differentiate between the responses of different bone metastases to multimodality therapies.  Advances in knowledge:   MetsBST reduces the variability in assessment of tumour burden caused by subjective interpretation. Therefore, it is a useful aid to physicians reporting nuclear medicine scans, and may improve decision-making in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer.""","""['Ali H D Alshehri', 'Sarah O S Osman', 'Kevin M Prise', 'Caoimhghin Campfield', 'P G Turner', 'Suneil Frcr PhD Jain', ""Joe M O'Sullivan"", 'Aidan J Cole']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Br J Radiol""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Measuring the unmeasurable: automated bone scan index as a quantitative endpoint in prostate cancer clinical trials.', 'The Automated Bone Scan Index as a Predictor of Response to Prostate Radiotherapy in Men with Newly Diagnosed Metastatic Prostate Cancer: An Exploratory Analysis of STAMPEDE\'s ""M1|RT Comparison"".', 'Assessing Radiographic Response to 223Ra with an Automated Bone Scan Index in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Integrating bone targeting radiopharmaceuticals into the management of patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer with symptomatic bone metastases.', 'Radiomics in prostate cancer: an up-to-date review.']"""

However, because of inter- and intrareader variability in interpretation of F-18 fluciclovine positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), it is difficult to reliably discern between necrotic tissue owing to radiation therapy and tumor tissue. Our goal is to develop a computational methodology using Haralick texture analysis that can be used as an adjunct tool to improve and standardize the interpretation of F-18 fluciclovine PET/CT to identify biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer. Four main textural features were chosen by variable selection procedure using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression and bootstrapping, and then included as predictors in subsequent logistic ridge regression model for prediction (n = 28). Age at prostatectomy, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level before the PET/CT imaging, and number of days between the prostate-specific antigen measurement and PET/CT imaging were also included in the prediction model. The overfitting-corrected area under the curve and Brier score of the proposed model were 0.94 (95% CI: 0.81, 1.00) and 0.12 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.23), respectively. Compared with a model with textural features (TI model) and that with only clinical information (CI model), the proposed model achieved 2% and 32% increase in AUC and 8% and 48% reduction in Brier score, respectively. Combining Haralick textural features based on the PET/CT imaging data with clinical information shows a high potential of enhanced prediction of the biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.""","""['Hakmook Kang', 'E Edmund Kim', 'Sepideh Shokouhi', 'Kenneth Tokita', 'Hye-Won Shin']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Tomography""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'The Clinical Utility of 18F-Fluciclovine PET/CT in Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer: an Academic Center Experience Post FDA Approval.', 'A bicentric retrospective analysis of clinical utility of 18F-fluciclovine PET in biochemically recurrent prostate cancer following primary radiation therapy: is it helpful in patients with a PSA rise less than the Phoenix criteria?', 'Fluorine-18-Labeled Fluciclovine PET/CT in Primary and Biochemical Recurrent Prostate Cancer Management.', 'Imaging of Prostate Cancer Using Fluciclovine.', 'Beyond diagnosis: is there a role for radiomics in prostate cancer management?', 'Towards differentiation of brain tumor from radiation necrosis using multi-parametric MRI: Preliminary results at 4.7\xa0T using rodent models.', 'Radiomics and artificial intelligence in prostate cancer: new tools for molecular hybrid imaging and theragnostics.', 'Dynamic PET Imaging Using Dual Texture Features.', 'Stability of Radiomic Features across Different Region of Interest Sizes-A CT and MR Phantom Study.']"""

Therefore, for most developing countries, the development of intelligent medical systems can greatly alleviate the social contradictions arising from this problem. In this study, a new data decision-making intelligent system for prostate cancer based on perceptron neural network is proposed, which mainly makes decisions by associating some relevant disease indicators and combining them with medical images. Through data collection, analysis and integration of medical data, as well as the disease detection and decision-making process, patients are given an auxiliary diagnosis and treatment, so as to solve the problems and social contradictions faced by most developing countries. Through the study of hospitalization information of more than 8,000 prostate patients in three hospitals, about 2,156,528 data items were collected and compiled for experiment purposes. Experimental data shows that when the patient base increases from 200 to 8,000, the accuracy of the machine-assisted diagnostic system will increase from 61% to 87%, and the doctor's diagnosis rate will be reduced to 81%. From the study, it is concluded that when the patient base reaches a certain number, the diagnostic accuracy of the machine-assisted diagnosis system will exceed the doctor's expertise.

Parallel evolutionary events, which cause disruption in the same genes (such as BCL9, MCL1, ARNT (also known as HIF1B), TERT and MYC) within separate subclones, were present in 37% of tumours. Most recurrent losses probably occurred before whole-genome doubling, that was found as a clonal event in 49% of tumours. However, loss of heterozygosity at the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus and loss of chromosome 8p to a single haploid copy recurred at substantial subclonal frequencies, even in tumours with whole-genome doubling, indicating ongoing karyotype remodelling. Focal amplifications that affected chromosomes 1q21 (which encompasses BCL9, MCL1 and ARNT), 5p15.33 (TERT), 11q13.3 (CCND1), 19q12 (CCNE1) and 8q24.1 (MYC) were frequently subclonal yet appeared to be clonal within single samples.

Although most therapies targeting AR are initially effective in CaP patients, drug resistance is inevitable, mainly because of the inappropriate re-activation of AR pathway. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we found that phospholipase C epsilon (PLCɛ) was highly expressed in CaP samples, and was closely associated with AR signaling activities. PLCɛ depletion triggered enhanced autophagic activities via AMPK/ULK1 pathway, causing autophagy-mediated AR degradation and inhibition of AR nuclear translocation. This subsequently reduced AR signals in CaP and inhibited AR-driven cell migration/invasion. Furthermore, a positive correlation between PLCɛ and AR signaling activity was also observed in bicalutamide-resistant CaP samples and in AR-antagonist-resistant CaP cell models. PLCɛ depletion resulted in the failure to establish AR-antagonist-resistant CaP cell lines, and hindered the metastatic prowess of already established ones.

Results:   Data from 68 patients (SPARTAN: n = 34, TITAN: n = 28, 56021927PCR1008: n = 6) receiving apalutamide 240 mg orally once-daily were analyzed. Rash (13 [19.1%]) and maculo-papular rash (11 [16.2%]) were the most frequently reported skin rash. All Grade and Grade 3 skin rash occurred in 35 (51.5%) and 10 (14.7%) patients, respectively. Most (85.7%) skin rash occurred within 4 months of apalutamide initiation and resolved in a median time of 1 month following the use of antihistamines, topical or systemic corticosteroids, with/without apalutamide dose interruptions/reductions. Median time-to-remission of first incidence of rash and maximum grade incidence of rash were 1.0 month (IQR: 0.36-1.81) and 1.0 month (IQR: 0.30-2.43), respectively. No significant clinical risk factors for the incidence of skin rash were observed. Areas under the curve (0-24 h) (AUC0-24, ss) at steady-state of plasma apalutamide concentration were numerically slightly higher in patients with skin rash than those without.  Conclusions:   No clinical risk factors for rash could be detected. There is a potential correlation between incidence of skin rash and plasma exposure to apalutamide.

So far, no standardized and easy-to-use parameter has been implemented to measure surgical experience or efficiency which could be useful for training and quality control purposes. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the learning curves of 2 HoLEP beginners and to identify applicable efficiency outcome measures as well as potentially complicating factors in performing HoLEP.  Patients and methods:   A total of 594 patients treated by HoLEP between September 2016 and May 2019 were enrolled. The procedures were initially performed by 1 HoLEP expert (reference surgeon); over time, 2 further surgeons were trained. Baseline characteristics, enucleation weight, morcellation and enucleation time, laser energy usage, and postoperative results were recorded prospectively. The learning curves of the 2 novices were analyzed and compared to the reference surgeon. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors for postoperative grade ≥2 complications.  Results:   Median enucleation ratio and complication rates did not significantly alter along the learning curves. Median enucleation speed and laser energy application of the 2 novices significantly improved with growing experience. Combining these variables, we introduced the ""HoLEP efficiency score"" (HES) which demonstrated the most appropriate value to reflect the surgical experience and efficiency. The median HES for the reference surgeon was 82.8 min kJ/g. For the 2 novices, a drop from 130 and 124.4 min kJ/g by -57 and -30%, respectively, was observed. Among several tested clinical parameters, the presence of prostate cancer (p = 0.047) and the surgical caseload (p < 0.001) influenced the HES. On multivariable logistic regression, American Society of Anesthesiologists score and prostate cancer were independent predictors for grade ≥2 complications (p = 0.002, odds ratio [OR] 2.042 and p = 0.038, OR 1.940).  Conclusion:   We introduce the HES as an objective and measurable tool to quantify surgical efficiency. In clinical practice, the HES may find application in training and quality control purposes as well as in comparing surgical modifications and hardware. Patients with prostate cancer seem to be more challenging cases and have a higher risk for complications, and may preferably be treated by experienced surgeons.""","""['Bernd Rosenhammer', 'Maximilian Schönhärl', 'Roman Mayr', 'Marco J Schnabel', 'Maximilian Burger', 'Christian Eichelberg']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Urol Int""","""['Switching Lasers: Learning Curve of Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate in Surgeons Experienced in Thulium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate.', 'Anteroposterior dissection three-lobe technique: an effective surgical method for inexperienced surgeons performing holmium laser enucleation of the prostate.', 'Evaluation of the Learning Curve for Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate Using Multiple Outcome Measures.', 'Current status of holmium laser enucleation of the prostate.', 'A Focused Review on the Effects of Preoperative 5α-Reductase Inhibitors Treatment in Patients Undergoing Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate: What Do We Know So Far?', ""Learning curve and functional outcomes after laser enucleation of the prostate for benign prostate hyperplasia according to surgeon's caseload.""]"""

In this study, we present two novel label-free approaches for studying EVs; characterization of EV composition by time-gated surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TG-SERS) and monitoring the kinetics and amount of cellular uptake of EVs by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in real-time. Using these methods, we characterized the most abundant EVs of human blood, red blood cell (RBC)- and platelet (PLT)-derived EVs and studied their interactions with prostate cancer cells. Complementary studies were performed with nanoparticle tracking analysis for concentration and size determinations of EVs, zeta potential measurements for surface charge analysis, and fluorophore-based confocal imaging and flow cytometry to confirm EV uptake. Our results revealed distinct biochemical features between the studied EVs and demonstrated that PLT-derived EVs were more efficiently internalized by PC-3 cells than RBC-derived EVs.

The aim of this work is to identify an effective biomarker for predicting therapeutic effectiveness of docetaxel in mCRPC patients.  Methods:   We examined DNA polymerase theta (POLQ) expression in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and Tissue microarray. Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to estimate the prognostic significance of POLQ. A series of functional analyses were conducted in cell lines and xenograft models. Regulated pathways were predicted by Geneset Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) software and further investigated by luciferase reporter and RT-PCR assays.  Results:   We found that POLQ mRNA levels in CRPC tissues was significantly higher than that of other DNA polymerases in non-CRPC prostate tissues. POLQ upregulation was extensively detected in mCRPC and strongly predicted a poor prognosis. POLQ knockdown enhanced docetaxel sensitivity in a cell-based cytotoxicity assay and promoted the therapeutic effect on the tumor growth of metastatic PC-3M cells in xenograft models. The computational simulation by GSEA software significantly predicted the association between POLQ upregulation and the activation of E2F/G2M checkpoint-related pathways. Moreover, luciferase reporter and RT-PCR assays demonstrated that POLQ knockdown downregulated the transcriptional regulatory activity of E2F and repressed E2F/G2M checkpoint-regulated CDK1 in mCRPC cells.

On the basis of expert consensus, PI-RADS version 2.1 (v2.1) introduced the transition zone (TZ) atypical benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) nodule, defined as a TZ lesion with an incomplete or absent capsule (T2 score, 2). PI-RADS v2.1 also included a revised scoring pathway whereby such nodules, if exhibiting marked restricted diffusion (DWI score, 4-5), are upgraded from overall PI-RADS category 2 to category 3 (2 + 1 TZ lesions). OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to compare the rates of detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) in prospectively reported 2 + 1 TZ lesions, as defined by PI-RADS v2.1, and conventional 3 + 0 TZ lesions with targeted biopsy as the reference standard. METHODS. This retrospective study included men with no known PCa or with treatment-naïve grade group (GG) 1 PCa who underwent 3-T multiparametric MRI of the prostate with prospective reporting by means of PI-RADS v2.1. Patients with at least one PI-RADS category 3 TZ lesion who underwent targeted biopsy formed the final sample. Biopsy results were summarized descriptively for 2 + 1 and 3 + 0 lesions. Generalized estimating equations were used to compare csPCa detection rates between groups. Associations between csPCa in 2 + 1 lesions and patient age, PSA level, prostate volume, PSA density, biopsy history, lesion size, and lesion ADC were tested with Kruskal-Wallis and Fisher exact tests. RESULTS. Among 1238 eligible patients who underwent MRI reported with PI-RADS v2.1, 2 + 1 lesions were reported in 6% (n = 69) and 3 + 0 TZ lesions in 7% (n = 87) of patients. No PCa, GG1 PCa, or csPCa was found in 84% (n = 41), 10% (n = 5), and 6% (n = 3) of 49 patients with 2 + 1 lesions who underwent targeted biopsy. Nor were they found in 74% (n = 45), 15% (n = 9), and 11% (n = 7) of 61 patients with 3 + 0 lesions who underwent targeted biopsy. The csPCa detection rate was not significantly different between 2 + 1 and 3 + 0 lesions (p = .31). All cases of csPCa were GG2, except for one 3 + 0 lesion with a GG3 tumor.

METHODS Age-adjusted mortality rates (per 100,000 men) were calculated by the direct method using the Segi world population as standard. Joinpoint regression was used to calculate the average annual percent change (AAPC), with a confidence interval of 95% (95%CI), by regional network and age group (50-59, 60-69, 70-79 and 80 years or more). RESULTS For the state of São Paulo, age-adjusted mortality rates were 15.2, 13.3 and 11.9 per 100,000 men, respectively, in the periods between 2000 to 2005, 2006 to 2010 and 2011 to 2015, with a significant decrease trend (AAPC = -2.10%; 95%CI -2.42 - -1.79) each year. Among the 17 networks, 11 presented significant mean annual reductions, ranging from -1.72% to -3.05%. From the age of 50 onwards, there was a sharper reduction in the groups from 50 to 59 (AAPC = -2.33%; 95%CI -3.04 - -1.62) and 60 to 69 years (AAPC = -2.84%; 95%CI - 3.25 - -2.43). CONCLUSION Although reductions in mortality are still slight, they indicate progress in prostate cancer control actions. Screening actions and changes in therapeutic behaviors in recent decades may be modifying incidence and survival, resulting in changes in the mortality profile. More detailed studies will be useful in understanding the factors that lead to the interregional variations found.""","""['Carolina Terra de Moraes Luizaga', 'Karina Braga Ribeiro', 'Luiz Augusto Marcondes Fonseca', 'José Eluf Neto']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Rev Saude Publica""","""['Overall survival and time trends in breast and cervical cancer incidence and mortality in the Regional Health District (RHD) of Barretos, São Paulo, Brazil.', 'Prostate cancer mortality in Serbia, 1991-2010: a joinpoint regression analysis.', 'Prostate cancer mortality in Brazil 1990-2019: geographical distribution and trends.', 'Cancer Statistics over Time in Northwestern São Paulo State, Brazil: Incidence and Mortality.', 'Trends and age-period-cohort effect on incidence and mortality of prostate cancer from 1990 to 2017 in China.']"""

It occurs in approximately one-third of patients with DM, predominantly adults, after the age of 40 (1). Different neoplasms have been described in association with DM, the most common of which are lung, breast, ovarian, gastrointestinal, prostate, and bladder cancers. The gender distribution of cancer type corresponds roughly to that of the general population (1,2). We report the case of a 58-year-old man who presented with facial heliotrope erythema, periorbital edema, Gottron's papules over the interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints, and Gottron's sign on the elbows (Figure 1). The patient also exhibited some less frequent skin signs of DM, such as shawl sign on the upper back and shoulders and V-sign on the neck and chest. Apart from the rash, he complained of weight loss, adynamia, dysphagia, cough, and scant expectoration, which he reported experiencing over a 3-month period. The muscle involvement consisted of proximal muscle weakness and had appeared a month after the skin rash. The histology of the skin lesion revealed epidermal atrophy, vacuolar degeneration of the basal keratinocytes, and perivascular and periadnexal lymphocytic infiltrate in the upper dermis (Figure 2). Laboratory examination found increased creatine kinase (2822 U/L) and liver enzymes, anemia, and leukocytosis. Screening for antinuclear antibodies and anti-Jo1 autoantibodies were both negative. The diagnosis of trichinosis was excluded via serologic examination. The impaired general condition of the patient led to a prompt paraneoplastic screening. Abdominal sonography detected hepatomegaly. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis visualized a mass in the distal part of the esophagus, narrowed lumen of the gastric cardia, enlarged gastric lymph nodes, lung and liver metastases, and ascites (Figure 3). The diagnosis of paraneoplastic DM in association with an advanced, metastatic, primary gastric carcinoma was established. Palliative surgery and chemotherapy were proposed to the patient, but he refused both. A systemic therapy with methylprednisolone 60 mg/daily and azathioprine 100 mg/daily was initiated, aiming to alleviate the progressively worsening muscle weakness, but proved ineffective. The patient died two months later of combined respiratory and heart failure. There are multiple prediction factors, such as cutaneous signs, laboratory data, and disease progression, which may direct the physician towards the possibility of paraneoplastic DM. Some atypical cutaneous lesions, such as cutaneous necrosis or vasculitis, hyperkeratotic follicular papules, vesiculo-bullous lesions, and flagellate erythema, are seen more frequently in cancer-associated DM (3,4). None of these were present in our patient. Pruritus is also described as a paraneoplastic sign (5). Some authors consider the increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein to be of predictive value for malignancy. Myositis-specific autoantibodies anti-TIF1-γ and anti-NXP-2, among the numerous novel serological markers for DM, are clearly associated with the presence of neoplasia (6,7). Unfortunately, we were unable to test for those autoantibodies. The symptom of dysphagia is a hallmark of paraneoplastic dermatomyositis and usually represents a manifestation of muscle weakness (8). In our case, it was rather a reflection of the endoluminal tumor, although it may also be a combination of both factors. In their study, Bowerman et al. investigated the risk of cancer development in different DM subtypes (9). They included 201 patients with adult-onset DM, 142 of with classic DM and 59 with the clinically amyopathic type. The estimated prevalence of malignancy-associated classic and clinically amyopathic DM were 9.9% and 1.7%, respectively. The authors concluded that older age and classic DM represent independent risk factors for malignancy-associated DM within 2 years of disease onset. Given that early diagnosis significantly impacts prognosis in patients with cancer-associated DM, recent studies support blind screening for internal malignancy (10). Leatham et al. performed a retrospective analysis of 400 patients with DM, finding a total of 53 cancers in 48 patients (some of the patients had two separate neoplasms). Among the group of paraneoplastic DM cases, 17 cancers were diagnosed via purely blind screening in patients with a lack of concerning history or physical examination. The authors claimed that the most informative tests were mammography and CT scanning. The above-mentioned predictive factors for paraneoplastic DM represent a useful tool for the clinician. Although it is generally accepted that patients with DM should undergo some type of cancer screening, there is no consensus regarding methods or frequency. New data suggest that blind screening in asymptomatic patients might be of great importance for early diagnosis and treatment of patients with cancer-associated DM.""","""['Joana Pozharashka', 'Lyubomir Dourmishev', 'Darena Rusinova', 'Maria Balabanova', 'Ljubka Miteva']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Acta Dermatovenerol Croat""","""['A systematic review of adult-onset clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis (dermatomyositis siné myositis): a missing link within the spectrum of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies.', 'Redefining dermatomyositis: a description of new diagnostic criteria that differentiate pure dermatomyositis from overlap myositis with dermatomyositis features.', 'Paraneoplastic dermatomyositis: a study of 12 cases.', 'Dermatomyositis and acute interstitial lung disease associated with MDA-5 antibodies: an atypical case.', 'Anti-MDA5 dermatomyositis.

To investigate the frequency of mutations in PCa susceptibility genes in Polish familial PCa cases and to estimate gene-related PCa risks and probability of aggressive disease, we analyzed the coding regions of 14 genes by exome sequencing in 390 men with familial prostate cancer and 308 cancer-free controls. We compared the mutation frequencies between PCa cases and controls. We also compared clinical characteristics of prostate cancers between mutation carriers and noncarriers. Of the 390 PCa cases, 76 men (19.5%) carried a mutation in BRCA1, BRCA2, NBN, ATM, CHEK2, HOXB13, MSH2 or MSH6 genes. No mutations were found in BRIP1, PTEN, TP53, MLH1, PMS2 and SPOP. Significant associations with familial PCa risk were observed for CHEK2, NBN, ATM, and HOXB13. High-grade (Gleason 8-10) tumors were seen in 56% of BRCA2, NBN or ATM carriers, compared to 21% of patients who tested negative for mutations in these genes (OR = 4.7, 95% CI 2.0-10.7, P = .0003). In summary, approximately 20% of familial prostate cancer cases in Poland can be attributed to mutations in eight susceptibility genes.

However, prognosis after Ra-223 administration varies among patients. The aim of the present study was to assess risk factors associated with the poor prognosis of patients treated with Ra-223.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed patients' records of treatment with Ra-223 between October 2016 and December 2019. All patients had mCRPC, bone metastasis, and no known visceral metastases, and received up to six cycles of Ra-223 (55 kBq/kg). Prognostic factors for OS were analyzed by Cox proportional hazards model and log-rank test.  Results:   We identified 42 patients who received at least one cycle of Ra-223 (median six cycles, range 1-6). Approximately two-thirds of patients had received at least two lines of therapy for mCRPC. The median age was 74 years, and the median follow-up duration was 13.6 months. The median OS time was 16.6 months. On multivariate analysis, PSA doubling time (PSADT) (0-3 months) at baseline, number of bone metastases (≥ 20), and treatment line of Ra-223 (4th-5th line) remained significantly correlated with the poor OS (HR 4.354, P = 0.003; HR 2.855, P = 0.020; and HR 4.871, P = 0.001, respectively).  Conclusions:   Our study demonstrated that a shorter PSADT, a heavier volume of bone metastases, and a later treatment line before Ra-223 are poor prognostic factors for mCRPC patients. These newly discovered risk factors may help select patients who potentially have long-term OS after Ra-223 treatment.""","""['Yoshiyuki Yamamoto', 'Yohei Okuda', 'Tomohiro Kanaki', 'Ryo Tanaka', 'Akira Nagahara', 'Yasutomo Nakai', 'Masashi Nakayama', 'Ken-Ichi Kakimoto', 'Kazuo Nishimura']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Clin Oncol""","""['Factors Associated With Survival Following Radium-223 Treatment for Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Complete Cycles of Radium-223 Improve Overall Survival in Patients With Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: A Retrospective Study.', 'Clinicopathologic factors that influence prognosis and survival outcomes in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with Radium-223.', 'Optimal usage of radium-223 in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Selection and monitoring of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer for treatment with radium-223.', 'Management of bone metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-specific antigen doubling time following radium-223 treatment as a predictor of the clinical course in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The safety of radium-223 combined with new-generation hormonal agents in bone metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.', 'Clinical significance of completion of radium-223 treatment and acute adverse events in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Novel nomogram developed for determining suitability of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients to receive maximum benefit from radium-223 dichloride treatment-Japanese Ra-223 Therapy in Prostate Cancer using Bone Scan Index (J-RAP-BSI) Trial.']"""

Objective:   Conduct a preliminary analysis of the implementation of a risk-stratified prostate cancer screening algorithm in a single health care system.  Design:   Comparison of men seen pre-implementation (2/1/2016-2/1/2017) vs. post-implementation (2/2/2017-2/21/2018).  Participants:   Men, aged 40-75 years, without a history of prostate cancer, who were seen by a primary care provider.  Interventions:   The algorithm was integrated into two components in the electronic health record (EHR): in Health Maintenance as a personalized screening reminder and in tailored messages to providers that accompanied prostate-specific antigen (PSA) results.  Main measures:   Primary outcomes: percent of men who met screening algorithm criteria; percent of men with a PSA result. Logistic repeated measures mixed models were used to test for differences in the proportion of individuals that met screening criteria in the pre- and post-implementation periods with age, race, family history, and PSA level included as covariates.  Key results:   During the pre- and post-implementation periods, 49,053 and 49,980 men, respectively, were seen across 26 clinics (20.6% African American). The proportion of men who met screening algorithm criteria increased from 49.3% (pre-implementation) to 68.0% (post-implementation) (p < 0.001); this increase was observed across all races, age groups, and primary care clinics. Importantly, the percent of men who had a PSA did not change: 55.3% pre-implementation, 55.0% post-implementation. The adjusted odds of meeting algorithm-based screening was 6.5-times higher in the post-implementation period than in the pre-implementation period (95% confidence interval, 5.97 to 7.05).  Conclusions:   In this preliminary analysis, following implementation of an EHR-based algorithm, we observed a rapid change in practice with an increase in screening in higher-risk groups balanced with a decrease in screening in low-risk groups.

As a self-report measure of PC, the Patient Competence Questionnaire 57 (PCQ-57) has only rarely been evaluated psychometrically. Therefore, we aimed to re-examine its dimensionality and its relationships with related constructs and potential psychosocial cancer outcomes.  Methods:   We surveyed 424 breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer patients from clinics for oncological rehabilitation and private oncology practices who completed the PCQ-57 and self-report measures of coping, coping self-efficacy, fear of progression, and depression. Patients' PCQ-57 responses were submitted to principal axis factor analyses. Using the original scoring keys, we computed internal consistencies (Cronbach's α) and Pearson correlations between all measures.  Results:   Factor analyses suggested 5 of the 8 original PCQ-57 dimensions to replicate satisfactorily, their internal consistencies ranging from 0.74 to 0.88.

Conclusion:   The results support the reliability and validity of 5 of the 8 original PCQ-57 scales while suggesting refinement of the others. The replicated scales may help identify patients in need of support for dealing with the multiple tasks of adjusting to cancer.

However, it is unclear whether luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone antagonists can decrease acute urinary tract toxicity during external beam radiotherapy. This study aimed to assess whether luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone antagonists used as neoadjuvant therapy reduced acute urinary tract toxicity during external beam radiotherapy compared with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists.  Methods:   The study included 78 patients who underwent intensity-modulated radiation therapy for intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer between April 2013 and January 2020. Irradiation was initiated after 3-6 months of neoadjuvant therapy. Androgen deprivation therapy was given to the intermediate-risk group for 6 months and the high-risk group for 2-3 years. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group toxicity grading scale was used to evaluate the urinary tract system toxicity. Relevant clinical factors were used in matching patients based on propensity scores to enable comparison between the groups.  Results:   Each group had 27 matched patients.

This pipeline explicitly accounts for off-target binding to the related serine proteases matriptase and HGFA (human hepatocyte growth factor activator). We completed the pipeline incorporating ADMET properties of the candidate inhibitors into custom multi-objective optimization functions.

We sought to assess the association between upfront chemotherapy and overall survival in men with mHSPC in a real-world cohort.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective cohort study of men with de novo, treatment-naïve metastatic prostate cancer from a large, national cancer database in the United States (2014-2015). Men in the upfront chemotherapy group received chemotherapy within 4 months of diagnosis (n = 1033, 28%) versus no chemotherapy or chemotherapy later than 12 months after diagnosis (controls; n = 2704, 72%). Overall survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and compared using multivariable Cox regression analysis.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 23 months, median overall survival was 35.7 months in the upfront chemotherapy group and 32.5 months for controls (log-rank p < 0.001). After adjusting for patient and clinical variables, upfront chemotherapy was associated with longer overall survival (hazard ratio 0.78, 95% confidence interval 0.68-0.89, p < 0.001). In exploratory analyses, the association between upfront chemotherapy and overall survival did not differ by age groups, race, or number of comorbidities (all interaction p > 0.2).  Conclusions:   In this real-world cohort, upfront chemotherapy for mHSPC was associated with longer overall survival. These data support the continued use of chemotherapy for men with mHSPC regardless of race or age if they are fit for chemotherapy and underscore the importance of evaluating cancer therapeutics outside of clinical trials to demonstrate treatment efficacy in populations that may be underrepresented in clinical trials.""","""['Adam B Weiner', 'Oliver S Ko', 'Eric V Li', 'Amanda X Vo', 'Anuj S Desai', 'Kieran J Breen', 'Robert B Nadler', 'Alicia K Morgans']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Impact of pretreatment anemia on upfront abiraterone acetate therapy for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: a multicenter retrospective study.', 'Time of metastatic disease presentation and volume of disease are prognostic for metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC).', 'Comparative assessment of docetaxel for safety and efficacy between hormone-sensitive and castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Management of Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer (mHSPC): an Evolving Treatment Paradigm.', 'Upfront Chemotherapy for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Effect of Chemotherapy on Overall Survival in Contemporary Metastatic Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Effectiveness of Docetaxel for Metastatic Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer in Clinical Practice.']"""

Methods:   Newly diagnosed mPCa patients with M1a/b substages, treated with EBRT or no EBRT were abstracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2004-2016). Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox-regression models targeted overall mortality (OM) and cancer specific-mortality (CSM) according to EBRT administration. M1 substages and PSA stratified analyses were performed. Internal validation relied on 2000 bootstrap resamples.  Results:   Of 15,494 patients, 1156 (7.5%) were M1a vs 14,338 (92.5%) were M1b. PSA at diagnosis ≤10.0 ng/ml was recorded in 1463 (9.4%) patients. In all 15,494 patients, EBRT did not affect OM (hazard ratio [HR] 1.0; p = 0.5). However, in M1a patients and M1b patients with PSA ≤ 10.0 ng/ml EBRT was associated with lower OM (HR 0.73, CI 0.62-0.86; p < 0.001) but not in M1b patients with PSA > 10.0 ng/ml. The PSA cut-off of ≤ 10.0 ng/ml represented the most statistically significant cut-off for OM prediction in M1b patients. Moreover, internal validation with 2000 bootstrap resamples confirmed these findings. Finally, all results were virtually the same, when CSM represented the endpoint of interest.  Conclusions:   We validated the OM reduction associated with EBRT in M1a and M1b patients with PSA ≤ 10.0 ng/ml but not in M1b patients with PSA > 10.0 ng/ml.

Conclusions:   Use of this approach resulted in the immortalization of independent clones of PrEC that retained normal characteristics, were stable, and non-transformed.

The pathways are heavily interconnected and act on a variety of common effectors that can lead to the development of resistance to drug inhibitors. Most current treatments exhibit issues with toxicity and resistance. We investigated the novel multikinase PIM/PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, AUM302, versus a combination of the PIM inhibitor, AZD-1208, and the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 (Dactolisib) to determine their impact on mRNA and phosphoprotein expression, as well as their functional efficacy. We have determined that around 20% of prostate cancer patients overexpress the direct targets of these drugs, and this cohort are more likely to have a high Gleason grade tumour (≥ Gleason 8). A co-targeted inhibition approach offered broader inhibition of genes and phosphoproteins in the PI3K/mTOR pathway, when compared to single kinase inhibition. The preclinical inhibitor AUM302, used at a lower dose, elicited a comparable or superior functional outcome compared with combined AZD-1208 + BEZ235, which have been investigated in clinical trials, and could help to reduce treatment toxicity in future trials.

Patient-specific 3D resin models were printed based on preoperative multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) to provide an exact 3D impression of significant tumor lesions. RP and IFS were planned in a patient-tailored fashion. The 36-region Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) v2.0 scheme was used to compare the MRI/3D print with whole-mount histopathology. In all cases, localization of the index lesion was correctly displayed by MRI and the 3D model. Localization of significant PC lesions correlated significantly (Pearson`s correlation coefficient of 0.88; p < 0.001). In addition, a significant correlation of the width, length, and volume of the tumor and prostate gland, derived from the printed model and histopathology, was found, using Pearson's correlation analyses and Bland-Altman plots. In conclusion, 3D-printed prostate models correlate well with final pathology and can be used to tailor RP.

Prostate biomarker tests, such as the ExoDx™ Prostate (IntelliScore), or EPI test, have been shown to provide individualized risk assessment of clinically significant prostate cancer at initial biopsy; however, the performance in the repeat biopsy setting is not well established.  Methods:   As part of a previous prospective clinical validation study evaluating the performance of the EPI test, we collected first-catch, non-DRE urine samples across 22 sites from men with at least one prior negative biopsy scheduled to undergo a repeat prostate biopsy to rule out prostate cancer. All men were 50 years or older with a PSA 2-10 ng/mL. Exosomal mRNA was extracted and expression of three genomic markers, PCA3, ERG and SPDEF was measured. The resulting EPI score was correlated with biopsy results.  Results:   229 men with a prior negative biopsy underwent repeat biopsies. ExoDx Prostate demonstrated good performance ruling out high-grade (Grade group 2, GG2, or higher) prostate cancer (HGPCa) using the previously validated 15.6 cut point in the initial biopsy setting. The EPI test yielded an NPV of 92% independent of other clinical features and would have avoided 26% of unnecessary biopsies while missing only five patients with HGPCa (2.1%). Furthermore, the EPI test provided additional information at a cut-point of 20 and 29.6 with an NPV of 94%, potentially delaying 35 and 61% of unnecessary biopsies, respectively.

The Ang-(1-9) and Ang-(3-7) are the less known active peptides of RAS. This study examines the influence of these two peptide hormones on the metabolic activity, proliferation and migration of prostate cancer cells. Significant changes in MTT dye reduction were observed depending on the type of angiotensin and its concentration as well as time of incubation. Ang-(1-9) did not regulate the 2D cell division of either prostate cancer lines however, it reduced the size of LNCaP colonies formed in soft agar, maybe through down-regulation of the HIF1a gene. Ang-(3-7) increased the number of PC3 cells in the S phase and improved anchorage-independent growth as well as mobility. In this case, a significant increase in MKI67, BIRC5, and CDH-1 gene expression was also observed as well as all members of the NF-kB family. Furthermore, we speculate that this peptide can repress the proliferation of LNCaP cells by NOS3-mediated G2/M cell cycle arrest. No changes in expression of BIRC5 and BCL2/BAX ratio were observed but a decrease mRNA proapoptotic BAD gene was seen. In the both lines, Ang-(3-7) improved ROCK1 gene expression however, increased VEGF and NOS3 mRNA was only seen in the PC3 or LNCaP cells, respectively. Interestingly, it appears that Ang-(1-9) and Ang-(3-7) can modulate the level of steroidogenic enzymes responsible for converting cholesterol to testosterone in both prostate cancer lines. Furthermore, in PC3 cells, Ang-(1-9) upregulated AR expression while Ang-(3-7) upregulated the expression of both estrogen receptor genes.

We also analyzed 46 hypopharyngeal cancer patients with squamous cell carcinoma treated with radiotherapy between March 2002 and December 2009. The properly trained ANN analysis using a standard feedforward, back-propagation neural network was used to predict the radiotherapy treatment results. Results: The areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) were 0.939 for patients treated with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT)+androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), 0.803 for IMRT alone, and 0.960 for 3D-conformal radiotherapy (CRT) alone in prostate cancer.

However, how to leverage cellular signaling to ablate TMPRSS2-ERG oncoprotein for PCa treatment remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that DNA damage induces proteasomal degradation of wild-type ERG and TMPRSS2-ERG oncoprotein through ERG threonine-187 and tyrosine-190 phosphorylation mediated by GSK3β and WEE1, respectively. The dual phosphorylation triggers ERG recognition and degradation by the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBW7 in a manner independent of a canonical degron. DNA damage-induced TMPRSS2-ERG degradation was abolished by cancer-associated PTEN deletion or GSK3β inactivation. Blockade of DNA damage-induced TMPRSS2-ERG oncoprotein degradation causes chemotherapy-resistant growth of fusion-positive PCa cells in culture and in mice.

This study aimed to explore effects of atorvastatin on colony formation of PCa cells and radio-resistance of xenograft tumor models. MATERIAL AND METHODS PCa cell lines, including PC3, DU145, and Lncap, were treated with irradiation (4 Gy) and/or atorvastatin (6 μg/mL). Cells were divided into tumor cell group, irradiation treatment group (IR group) and irradiation+atorvastatin treatment group (IR-AS group). Xenograft tumor mouse model was established. Plate clone formation assay (multi-target/single-hit model) was conducted to evaluate colony formation. Flow cytometry analysis was employed to detect apoptosis. Interaction between Bcl-2 and MSH2 was evaluated with immuno-fluorescence assay. RESULTS According to the plate colony formation assay and multi-target/single-hit model, IR-treatment significantly suppressed colony formation in PCa cells (including PC3, DU145, and Lncap cells) compared to no-IR treated cells (P<0.05). Atorvastatin remarkably enhanced inhibitive effects of irradiation on colony formation of PCa cells (P<0.05), however, the IR+AS group demonstrated no effects on apoptosis, comparing to IR group (P>0.05). Atorvastatin administration (IR+AS group) significantly reduced tumor size of IR-treated PCa cells-induced xenograft tumor mice (P<0.05). Bcl-2 interacted with MSH2 both in tumor tissues of xenograft tumor mice. CONCLUSIONS Atorvastatin administration inhibited colony formation in PCa cells and enhanced effects of radiotherapy on tumor growth of xenograft tumor mice, which might be associated with interaction between Bcl-2 and MSH2 molecule.""","""['Zhenhua He', 'Jingmin Yuan', 'Fuhui Shen', 'Fangang Zeng', 'Ping Qi', 'Zhiping Wang', 'Zhenxing Zhai']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Sci Monit""","""['Atorvastatin regulates the migration and invasion of prostate cancer through the epithelial-mesenchymal transformation and matrix metalloproteinase pathways.', 'Atorvastatin Enhances Inhibitory Effects of Irradiation on Tumor Growth by Reducing MSH2 Expression Both in Prostate Cancer Cells and Xenograft Tumor Models.', 'Mechanistic Study of Inhibitory Effects of Metformin and Atorvastatin in Combination on Prostate Cancer Cells in Vitro and in Vivo.', 'Galiellalactone is a novel therapeutic candidate against hormone-refractory prostate cancer expressing activated Stat3.', 'A review of effects of atorvastatin in cancer therapy.', 'The role of lipid metabolism in cancer radioresistance.', 'Enhanced tumor inhibiting effect of 131I-BDI-1-based radioimmunotherapy and cytosine deaminase gene therapy modulated by a radio-sensitive promoter in nude mice bearing bladder cancer.', 'Antidiabetics, Anthelmintics, Statins, and Beta-Blockers as Co-Adjuvant Drugs in Cancer Therapy.', 'Statin Use and the Risk of Prostate Cancer Biochemical Recurrence Following Definitive Therapy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Cohort Studies.', 'Atorvastatin regulates the migration and invasion of prostate cancer through the epithelial-mesenchymal transformation and matrix metalloproteinase pathways.']"""

Methods:   This retrospective study focused on patients who underwent RC followed by ONB reconstruction and those who consented for IPSS, quality of life (QOL) based on urinary symptoms (IPSS-QOL), and OABSS assessments in the follow-up period. The patients were divided according to gender into the male group (M-group) and female group (F-group). All patients were evaluated using IPSS, IPSS-QOL, and OABSS every 3 months.

Methods:   A total of 14 921 patients, who underwent radical prostatectomy with ePLND at eight European tertiary referral centres, were retrospectively identified. After exclusion of patients with incomplete biopsy or pathological data, 12 009 were included. Of these, 609 had undergone multiparametic magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsies. Among ePLND-related complications we included lymphocele, lymphoedema, haemorrhage, infection and sepsis. The performances of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre (MSKCC), Briganti 2012, Briganti 2017, Briganti 2019, Partin 2016 and Yale models were evaluated using receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis (area under the curve [AUC]), calibration plots, and decision-curve analysis.  Results:   Overall, 1158 patients (9.6%) had LNI, with a mean of 17.7 and 3.2 resected and positive nodes, respectively. No significant differences in AUCs were observed between the MSKCC (0.79), Briganti 2012 (0.79), Partin 2016 (0.78), Yale (0.80), Briganti 2017 (0.81) and Briganti 2019 (0.76) models. A direct comparison of older models showed that better discrimination was achieved with the MSKCC and Briganti 2012 nomograms. A tendency for underestimation was seen for all the older models, whereas the Briganti 2017 and 2019 nomograms tended to overestimate LNI risk.

Patients and methods:   We analyzed the data of 539 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) for biopsy GS 3 + 4 PCa from two tertiary referral centers. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine significant predictors of GS upgrading. GS upgrading, the study outcome, was defined as GS ≥ 4 + 3 at definitive pathology at RP specimen.  Results:   GS upgrading rate was 35.3% and biochemical recurrence (BCR) rate was 8.0%. GS upgrading group was significantly older (p = 0.015), had significantly higher prebiopsy serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (p = 0.001) and PSA density (p = 0.003), had a higher number of prostate biopsy (p = 0.026). There were 413 lesions (76.6%) of PI-RADS lesion ≥ 4, 236 (57.1%) for PI-RADS 4 and 177 (42.9%) for PI-RADS 5 lesion. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age (p = 0.045), initial prebiopsy PSA level (p = 0.002) and presence of PI-RADS lesion ≥ 4 (p = 0.044) are independent predictors of GS upgrading.  Conclusion:   MpMRI can predict postoperative Gleason score upgrading in prostate cancer with Gleason score 3 + 4.

It has a crucial role for many diagnostic applications. Automatic segmentation such as that of the prostate and prostate zones from MR images facilitates many diagnostic and therapeutic applications. However, the lack of a clear prostate boundary, prostate tissue heterogeneity, and the wide interindividual variety of prostate shapes make this a very challenging task. To address this problem, we propose a new neural network to automatically segment the prostate and its zones. We term this algorithm Dense U-net as it is inspired by the two existing state-of-the-art tools-DenseNet and U-net. We trained the algorithm on 141 patient datasets and tested it on 47 patient datasets using axial T2-weighted images in a four-fold cross-validation fashion. The networks were trained and tested on weakly and accurately annotated masks separately to test the hypothesis that the network can learn even when the labels are not accurate. The network successfully detects the prostate region and segments the gland and its zones.

Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of TTTY15 and microRNA (miR)-337-3p in ESCC tissues and cell lines. Cell counting kit-8 method was used to detect the proliferation of ESCC cells. Transwell method was used to determine the migration and invasion of ESCC cells. Luciferase reporter assay was used to verify the interaction between TTTY15 and miR-337-3p. Western blot was used to analyze the effects of TTTY15 and miR-337-3p on Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) expression. In the present study, we demonstrated that the expression level of TTTY15 was significantly upregulated in ESCC tissues, while the expression of miR-337-3p was downregulated. In ESCC samples, the expression levels of TTTY15 and miR-337-3p were negatively correlated. TTTY15 knockdown could significantly reduce the proliferation, migration and invasion of ESCC cells, and miR-337-3p mimics had similar effects. In addition, overexpression of TTTY15 inhibited miR-337-3p by binding with it. TTTY15 could indirectly modulate JAK2, and overexpression of TTTY15 could reverse the inhibitory effects of miR-337-3p on malignant phenotypes of ESCC cells.

KDM5B controls H3K4me3/2 levels and regulates gene transcription and cell differentiation, yet the contributions of KDM5B to prostate cancer tumorigenesis remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the functional role of KDM5B in epigenetic dysregulation and prostate cancer progression in cultured cells and in mouse models of prostate epithelium-specific mutant Pten/Kdm5b. Kdm5b deficiency resulted in a significant delay in the onset of prostate cancer in Pten-null mice, whereas Kdm5b loss alone caused no morphologic abnormalities in mouse prostates. At 6 months of age, the prostate weight of Pten/Kdm5b mice was reduced by up to 70% compared with that of Pten mice. Pathologic analysis revealed Pten/Kdm5b mice displayed mild morphologic changes with hyperplasia in prostates, whereas age-matched Pten littermates developed high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer. Mechanistically, KDM5B governed PI3K/AKT signaling in prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo. KDM5B directly bound the PIK3CA promoter, and KDM5B knockout resulted in a significant reduction of P110α and PIP3 levels and subsequent decrease in proliferation of human prostate cancer cells. Conversely, KDM5B overexpression resulted in increased PI3K/AKT signaling. Loss of Kdm5b abrogated the hyperactivation of AKT signaling by decreasing P110α/P85 levels in Pten/Kdm5b mice. Taken together, our findings reveal that KDM5B acts as a key regulator of PI3K/AKT signaling; they also support the concept that targeting KDM5B is a novel and effective therapeutic strategy against prostate cancer.

The aim of the study was to provide population-based analyses of all common tumour sites to assess the cancer burden in the Augsburg study region.  Setting:   Total population of the study region of Augsburg (668 522 residents), Southern Germany.  Participants:   The data obtained from the Cancer Registry Augsburg comprised 37 487 incident cases of malignant tumours (19 313 men and 18 174 women) diagnosed between 2005 and 2016 in the Augsburg region's resident population.  Primary and secondary outcome measures:   We calculated sex-specific, age-standardised incidence rates and annual percent change to assess time trends. In men and in women, 3-year and 5-year relative survival was calculated and results were compared with the latest German estimates. Survival trends were presented for the most common cancers only.  Results:   Decreasing age-standardised incidence rates were observed for prostate cancer and for colorectal cancer in men. For oropharyngeal cancer, rates declined in men, but significantly increased in women. Incidence for female breast cancer remained stable. Five-year relative survival ranged between 6.4% (95% CI: 4.1% to 10.1%) for pancreatic cancer and 97.7% (95% CI: 96.0% to 99.4%) for prostate cancer in men and between 10.2% (95% CI: 7.1% to 14.6%) for pancreatic cancer and 96.6% (95% CI: 93.6% to 99.6%) for malignant melanoma in women. Trends in 3-year survival of the five most common tumour sites in men showed a significant increase for lung and oropharyngeal cancer. In women, continuously rising survival trends were observed for breast cancer.

However, the incremental benefit of MRI-targeted biopsy (MBx) beyond SBx with ultrasound-targeted biopsy (UBx) is less clear.  Objective:   We performed a three-way comparison of UBx versus MBx versus SBx for PCa detection.  Design, setting, and participants:   A prospective, single-center cohort study was conducted on consecutive patients with PCa suspicion or low-risk PCa on active surveillance (AS). All men had at least one lesion (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System [PI-RADS] ≥3) on pre-biopsy mpMRI. UBx, MBx, and SBx were performed during the same encounter, and the urologists were blinded to MRI results and targeting until both SBx and UBx were completed.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The ability of each biopsy type to identify the highest grade group (GG) was determined, and UBx and MBx were compared using a paired t test.  Results and limitations:   We prospectively enrolled 201 consecutive men undergoing targeted prostate biopsy: 72 (36%) were biopsy-naïve, 34 (17%) had a prior negative SBx, and 95 (47%) were on AS. Median age and prostate-specific antigen were 66 yr (interquartile range [IQR] 62-71) and 6.8 ng/ml (IQR 4.9-9.8), respectively. Suspicious hypoechoic lesions were reported on TRUS in 69%. Among the 169 men with PCa, SBx detected the highest GG or was equivalent to UBx/MBx in 136 (80%) men. UBx detected the highest GG or was equivalent to MBx in 19 (11%) men, and MBx alone detected the highest GG in 14 (8%) men. There was no significant difference between UBx and MBx in direct comparison (p = 0.08). Limitations include that patients were not randomized, our population was heterogeneous, and TRUS expertise at a tertiary care academic center might not reflect routine practice.  Conclusions:   In the setting of high expertise and experience with both ultrasound and MRI, MBx offers only a modest benefit over SBx and UBx.  Patient summary:   At a highly experienced academic medical center, we examined the detection rates of prostate cancer among men undergoing prostate biopsy using three techniques: transrectal ultrasound lesion-targeted biopsy, magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsy, and systematic biopsy.

We investigated whether there was an association between HP-infected peptic ulcers and the subsequent risk of prostate cancer.  Methods:   We collected HP-infected male patients from 1998 to 2008 from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database (LHID). HP-infected patients were identified as those who had a diagnosis of peptic ulcers upon admission and received HP eradication therapy within 1 year after diagnosis. The date of HP infection diagnosis upon admission was defined as the index date. Patients aged < 20 years or with a cancer history were excluded. For each HP-infected patient, we selected four males without peptic ulcers or a history of HP eradication in the LHID for the comparison cohort according to propensity score matching by age, index year, and comorbidity. The risk of prostate cancer and associated risk factors was assessed by Cox proportional hazard regression.  Results:   A total of 2620 HP infection treatment patients and 10,480 matched comparisons were selected. There were 36 patients in the HP-infected treatment cohort and 117 patients in the comparison cohort with documented prostate cancer development (1.52 and 1.21 per 1000 person-years, respectively). Compared to the comparison cohort, the HP infection cohort had a 1.26-fold increased prostate cancer risk in the Cox models after adjusting for matched-pairs (95% CI = 0.87-1.34).

Our prior analysis of human prostate biopsy samples demonstrated the increased expression of IL-6 and a downregulating trend for dopamine receptor gene family.  Objective:   The objective was to investigate the expression of dopamine receptors, their catabolizing enzyme and IL-6 in prostate cancer cell lines and assess pharmacological effect of dopamine receptor modulators as a novel class of drugs repurposed for the treatment of prostate cancer.  Methods:   The therapeutic effect of dopamine, DR agonists, and DR antagonist were examined using LNCaP and PC3 cell lines. Cell viability and proliferation were assessed by MTT assay and proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression analysis, respectively. Furthermore, bax/bcl2 ratio, immunofluorescence assay and flow cytometric assay were performed for apoptosis analysis. RT- qPCR analysis was used to characterize the relative expression of dopamine-related genes, catabolic enzyme Catechol-o-Methyl-Transferase (COMT) and IL-6 before and after treatment to assess the therapeutic effects of drugs.  Results:   LNCaP cells express DRD1, DRD2, DRD5 and COMT genes and PC3 cells only express IL-6 gene. In-vitro, dopamine receptor agonists reduced cell viability of LNCaP and PC3 cells. In contrast, dopamine and dopamine receptor antagonist significantly increased tumor growth in PC3 cells.  Conclusion:   Our results offer novel suggestion for a pathogenic role of dopamine receptor signaling in prostate cancer adenocarcinoma and indicates that modulators of DR- IL-6 pathway, including FDA-approved drug bromocriptine, might be utilized as novel drug repurposing strategy.""","""['Fatemeh Akbarian', 'Farid Dadkhah', 'Arezoo Campbell', 'Farrokh Asadi', 'Ghasem Ahangari']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Anticancer Agents Med Chem""","""['Eupatilin Inhibits the Proliferation and Migration of Prostate Cancer Cells through Modulation of PTEN and NF-κB Signaling.', 'Naringenin-Induced Apoptotic Cell Death in Prostate Cancer Cells Is Mediated via the PI3K/AKT and MAPK Signaling Pathways.', 'Adenosine induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cell lines, LNcap-FGC-10, DU-145, and PC3.', 'Emodin inhibits the proliferation of PC3 prostate cancer cells in vitro via the Notch signaling pathway.', 'The cannabinoid R+ methanandamide induces IL-6 secretion by prostate cancer PC3 cells.', 'Systematic Analysis of Neurotransmitter Receptors in Human Breast Cancer Reveals a Strong Association With Outcome and Uncovers HTR6 as a Survival-Associated Gene Potentially Regulating the Immune Microenvironment.', 'Identification of a Novel Nomogram to Predict Progression Based on the Circadian Clock and Insights Into the Tumor Immune Microenvironment in Prostate Cancer.', 'Dopamine and dopamine receptor D1 as a novel favourable biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma.']"""

However, a convenient and cost-effective platform for exosomal protein profiling is still lacking. Herein, a facile fluorescent aptasensor is developed to assess exosomal tumor-associated proteins, combining aptamers, aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgens), and graphene oxide (GO) as recognition elements, fluorescent dye, and the quencher, respectively. Specifically, numberous TPE-TAs could bind one aptamer and form aggregates rapidly, resulting in an amplified fluorescence signal. In the absence of tumor-derived exosomes, GO absorbs the TPE-TAs/aptamer complex, allowing fluorescence quenching. When the target exosomes are introduced, the aptamer preferentially binds with its target. Thus the TPE-TAs/aptamer complexes detach from GO surface, followed by the appearance of a ""turn-on"" fluorescent signal. Under the optimized conditions, the linear range of target exosomes is estimated to be 4.07 × 105 to 1.83 × 107 particles/μL (0.68-30.4 pM) with a detection limit of 3.43 × 105 particles/μL (0.57 pM). This strategy demonstrated great performance in differentiating prostate cancer from healthy individuals (AUC: 0.9790). Furthermore, by profiling three tumor-associated protein markers including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) on exosomes in a breast tumor cohort, this sensing platform diagnoses breast tumors with high efficiency (AUC: 0.9845) and exhibits a high sensitivity of 97.37% for distinguishing malignant breast cancers, where the stage I cases were detected with 92.31% sensitivity. Therefore, this aptasensor provides a promising strategy to profile tumor-derived exosomal proteins for early diagnosis in liquid biopsy.""","""['Bo Li', 'Chunchen Liu', 'Weilun Pan', 'Jianlei Shen', 'Jingyun Guo', 'Tingting Luo', 'Junjie Feng', 'Bo Situ', 'Taixue An', 'Ye Zhang', 'Lei Zheng']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Biosens Bioelectron""","""['Homogenous Magneto-Fluorescent Nanosensor for Tumor-Derived Exosome Isolation and Analysis.', 'Electrochemical aptasensor for exosomal proteins profiling based on DNA nanotetrahedron coupled with enzymatic signal amplification.', 'A light-up fluorescence resonance energy transfer magnetic aptamer-sensor for ultra-sensitive lung cancer exosome detection.', 'Recent advances of aptasensors for exosomes detection.', 'Recent advances in nanotechnology-enabled biosensors for detection of exosomes as new cancer liquid biopsy.', 'Paper-based biosensors as point-of-care diagnostic devices for the detection of cancers: a review of innovative techniques and clinical applications.', 'Interactions of Amino Group Functionalized Tetraphenylvinyl and DNA: A Label-Free ""On-Off-On"" Fluorescent Aptamer Sensor toward Ampicillin.', 'Advanced technologies for molecular diagnosis of cancer: State of pre-clinical tumor-derived exosome liquid biopsies.', 'Label-free Aptasensor for the Ultrasensitive Detection of Insulin Via a Synergistic Fluorescent Turn-on Strategy Based on G-quadruplex and AIEgens.', 'Small extracellular vesicles isolation and separation: Current techniques, pending questions and clinical applications.']"""

Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) eligibility criteria for lung cancer screening with CT require detailed smoking information and miss many incident lung cancers. An automated deep-learning approach based on chest radiograph images may identify more smokers at high risk for lung cancer who could benefit from screening with CT.  Objective:   To develop and validate a convolutional neural network (CXR-LC) that predicts long-term incident lung cancer using data commonly available in the electronic medical record (EMR) (chest radiograph, age, sex, and whether currently smoking).  Design:   Risk prediction study.  Setting:   U.S. lung cancer screening trials.  Participants:   The CXR-LC model was developed in the PLCO (Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian) Cancer Screening Trial (n = 41 856). The final CXR-LC model was validated in additional PLCO smokers (n = 5615, 12-year follow-up) and NLST (National Lung Screening Trial) heavy smokers (n = 5493, 6-year follow-up). Results are reported for validation data sets only.  Measurements:   Up to 12-year lung cancer incidence predicted by CXR-LC.  Results:   The CXR-LC model had better discrimination (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve [AUC]) for incident lung cancer than CMS eligibility (PLCO AUC, 0.755 vs. 0.634; P < 0.001). The CXR-LC model's performance was similar to that of PLCOM2012, a state-of-the-art risk score with 11 inputs, in both the PLCO data set (CXR-LC AUC of 0.755 vs. PLCOM2012 AUC of 0.751) and the NLST data set (0.659 vs. 0.650). When compared in equal-sized screening populations, CXR-LC was more sensitive than CMS eligibility in the PLCO data set (74.9% vs. 63.8%; P = 0.012) and missed 30.7% fewer incident lung cancers. On decision curve analysis, CXR-LC had higher net benefit than CMS eligibility and similar benefit to PLCOM2012.  Limitation:   Validation in lung cancer screening trials and not a clinical setting.

Thus, 97 breast cancer-affected individuals of African and European descent from the Alabama Hereditary Cancer Cohort were screened using the research-based gene-panel, B.O.P. (Breast, Ovarian, and Prostate cancer). Upon sequencing and bioinformatic processing, rare coding variants in 14 cancer susceptibility genes were categorized according to the American College of Medical Genetics guidelines and compared between ethnicities. Overall, 107 different variants were identified, the majority of which were benign/likely benign. A pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant was detected in 8.6% and 6.5% of African American and European American cases, respectively, which was not statistically significant. However, African Americans were more likely to have at least one variant of uncertain significance (VUS; p-value 0.006); they also had significantly more VUSs in BRCA1/2 compared to European Americans (p-value 0.015). Additionally, 51.4% of African Americans and 32.3% of European Americans harbored multiple rare variants, and African Americans were more likely to have at least one VUS and one benign/likely benign variant (p-value 0.032), as well as multiple benign/likely benign variants (p-value 0.089).

Results:   In the cohort of 23 651 male patients (median [interquartile range] age, 73 [66-79] years), 6904 (29.2%) did not receive ADT, 11 817 (50.0%) received GnRH agonists, 876 (3.7%) received orchiectomy, and 4054 (17.1%) received antiandrogen monotherapy. Overall, 1525 patients were diagnosed with incident dementia (1.72 per 100 person-years) during a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 3.46 (1.92-5.51) years. Compared with those who did not receive ADT, those using antiandrogen monotherapy showed an increased risk of dementia (weighted hazard ratio [HR], 1.34; 95% CI, 1.16-1.55) and AD (weighted HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.13-2.04). The risk of dementia was similar between GnRH agonist use or orchiectomy and no ADT use (GnRH agonist: weighted HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.00-1.28; orchiectomy: 1.00; 95% CI, 0.74-1.37). Several sensitivity analyses revealed consistent findings for both outcomes.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this study, the use of antiandrogen monotherapy was associated with increased risk of dementia or AD, while GnRH agonist use and orchiectomy had no significant difference compared with patients who did not receive ADT. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these findings.""","""['Wen-Kuan Huang', 'Chi-Hung Liu', 'See-Tong Pang', 'Jia-Rou Liu', 'John Wen-Cheng Chang', 'Chuang-Chi Liaw', 'Cheng-Lung Hsu', 'Yung-Chang Lin', 'Lai-Chu See']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Urological Oncology: Prostate Cancer.', 'Different androgen deprivation therapies might have a differential impact on cognition - An analysis from a population-based study using time-dependent exposure model.', 'No increased risk of dementia in patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a 5-year follow-up study.', 'Androgen deprivation increases the risk of fracture in prostate cancer patients: a population-based study in Chinese patients.', 'Stroke related to androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a meta-analysis and systematic review.', 'Neuropsychiatric Impact of Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Patients with Prostate Cancer: Current Evidence and Recommendations for the Clinician.', 'A Systematic Review on the Potential Acceleration of Neurocognitive Aging in Older Cancer Survivors.', ""Testosterone and Alzheimer's disease."", 'Increased cytokine gene expression and cognition risk associated with androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Renal Cell Carcinoma Treated With Targeted Therapies.', 'Testosterone, cognitive decline and dementia in ageing men.']"""

It has been shown that chronic inflammation due to a high-fat diet or bacterial infection has the potential to accelerate prostate cancer as well as its precursor, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), development. However, the underlying mechanism of how chronic inflammation promotes prostate cancer development, especially PIN, remains unclear. In this study, we showed that more macrophages were present in PIN areas as compared to the normal areas of human prostate. When co-culturing PIN cells with macrophages in 3D, more PIN cells had nuclear localized cyclin D1, indicating that macrophages enhanced PIN cell proliferation. We identified ICAM-1 and CCL2 as chemoattractants expressed by PIN cells to recruit macrophages. Furthermore, we discovered that macrophage-secreted cytokines including C5a, CXCL1, and CCL2 were responsible for increased PIN cell proliferation. These three cytokines activated ERK and JNK signaling in PIN cells through a ligand-receptor interaction. However, only blockade of ERK abolished macrophage cytokines-induced cell proliferation of PIN. Overall, our results provide a mechanistic view on how macrophages activated through chronic inflammation can expedite PIN progression during prostate cancer development.

In a recent trial, rivaroxaban was more efficacious than dalteparin in preventing CAT recurrence.  Objectives:   In a proof-of-concept study, we aimed to provide a mechanistic basis for improved efficacy of rivaroxaban compared to low molecular weight heparin in CAT treatment.  Methods:   We studied the effects of rivaroxaban, dalteparin, and tinzaparin at peak and trough levels on tumor cell-induced procoagulant activity and platelet aggregation in the presence or absence of the cationic leukocyte-derived enzyme, myeloperoxidase (MPO). Furthermore, pro-inflammatory conditions were generated by stimulating whole blood with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or phorbol-myristate-acetate (PMA), before measuring thrombin generation in plasma supernatants.  Results:   All three anticoagulants inhibited thrombin generation, fibrin clot formation, and platelet aggregation induced by the tissue factor-expressing prostate carcinoma cell line, 22Rv1. Pre-incubation with MPO partially attenuated the anticoagulant activity of dalteparin and tinzaparin, but not rivaroxaban, at trough levels. The effect of MPO did not involve the enzyme's catalytic properties, but required its structural integrity, as indicated by heat denaturation. In plasma obtained from LPS- or PMA-stimulated whole blood, elevated MPO antigen levels inversely correlated with the ability of tinzaparin to inhibit 22Rv1-induced thrombin generation.  Conclusions:   Myeloperoxidase release may partially attenuate the anticoagulant activity of trough levels of dalteparin and tinzaparin in the context of paraneoplastic leukocyte activation.

Because of the unique metabolism of tumor cells, the tumor microenvironment (TME) exhibits distinctive properties compared with normal tissues, among which the pH difference has been utilized as an ideal antitumor strategy. Herein, we introduce a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-controlled-release nanosystem with TME-responsiveness by applying hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles (HMSNs) as carriers loaded with calcium peroxide (CaO2) and coated with polyacrylic acid (PAA) to construct the functional material CaO2@HMSNs-PAA. The differences in pH values and exogenous ROS scavenging abilities between the tumor tissue and normal tissues and the dual pH-responsiveness from CaO2 and PAA lay a scientific foundation for the application of CaO2@HMSNs-PAA in the tumor-selective therapy for prostate cancer. Methods: The morphology and the structure of the nanosystem were characterized by the transmission electron microscope, scanning electron microscope, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, zeta potential, dynamic light scattering measurement, low-angle X-ray diffraction patterns and nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm. The CaO2 loading capacity and release profiles in different buffer solutions were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. The in vitro intracellular uptake of CaO2@HMSNs-PAA was explored on the PC-3 prostate cancer cell line via confocal laser scanning microscopy. The CCK-8 cell proliferation assay was conducted to evaluate the cytotoxicity of CaO2@HMSNs-PAA against PC-3 cells. ROS produced by CaO2@HMSNs-PAA was observed by a fluorescence microscope. The flow cytometry was utilized to analyze the apoptosis of PC-3 cells induced by CaO2@HMSNs-PAA. The Western blot analysis was performed to detect expressions of critical mitochondria-mediated apoptosis markers in PC-3 cells after incubation with CaO2@HMSNs-PAA. The in vivo biosafety and antitumor efficacy were evaluated out on BALB/c mice and BALB/c nude mice subcutaneously transplanted with PC-3 cells, respectively. Results: Comprehensive characterizations indicated the successful synthesis of CaO2@HMSNs-PAA with significant TME-responsiveness. The experimental results demonstrated that the well-developed nanocarrier could efficiently deliver CaO2 to the tumor site and release ROS in response to the decreased pH value of TME, exerting ideal antitumor effects both in vitro and in vivo by activating the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway. Simultaneously, this nanoplatform caused no detectable damage to normal tissues. Conclusions: After loading into the above nanocomposite, the free CaO2 without a significant antitumor effect can exert excellent antitumor efficacy by responsively releasing ROS under the acidic TME to induce the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis via remarkable oxidative stress and simultaneously minimize damages to normal tissues.

Materials and methods:   Inclusion criteria were: (1) histologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma; (2) evidence of biochemical relapse after primary tumor treatment; (3) ≤ 3 hypermetabolic oligorecurrent lesions detected by 18F-choline or 68Ga-PSMA PET-CT; (4) PET-CT imaging performed in a single nuclear medicine department; (5) patients treated with upfront stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) without hormone therapy; and (6) SBRT delivered with a dose per fraction ≥ 5 Gy. In the case of oligoprogression (≤ 3 lesions outside the previous RT field) after MTD, a further course of SBRT was proposed; otherwise, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) was administered.  Results:   A total of 118 lesions in 88 patients were analyzed. Forty-four (50%) patients underwent 68Ga-PSMA PET-guided SBRT, and the remaining underwent choline PET-based SBRT. The median follow-up was 25 months (range, 5-87 months) for the entire cohort. Overall survival and local control were both 100%. Distant progression occurred in 48 (54.5%) patients, for a median distant progression-free survival of 22.8 months (range, 14.4-28.8 months). The median pre-SBRT prostate-specific antigen was 2.04 ng/mL in the choline PET cohort and 0.58 ng/mL in the PSMA-PET arm. Disease-free survival rates were 63.6% and 34%, respectively, in the 68Ga-PSMA and choline PET group (P = .06). The ADT administration rate was higher after choline-PET-guided SBRT (P = .00) owing to the higher incidence of polymetastatic disease after first-course SBRT compared with 68Ga-PSMA-based SBRT.

However, the impact of cryo-needle/probe placement accuracy within the tumor and gland has not been extensively studied. We analyzed how variations in the placement of the cryo-needles, specifically errors leading to incomplete ablation, may affect prostate cancer's resulting cryoablation.  Materials and methods:   We performed a study based on isothermal models using Monte Carlo simulations to analyze the impact of needle placement errors on tumor coverage and the probability of positive ablation margin. We modeled the placement error as a Gaussian noise on the cryo-needle position. The analysis used retrospective MRI data of 15 patients with biopsy-proven, unifocal, and MRI visible prostate cancer to calculate the impact of placement error on the volume of the tumor encompassed by the -40°C and -20°C isotherms using one to four cryo-needles.  Results:   When the standard deviation of the placement error reached 3 mm, the tumor coverage was still above 97% with the -20°C isotherm, and above 81% with the -40°C isotherm using two cryo-needles or more. The probability of positive margin was significantly lower considering the -20°C isotherm (0.04 for three needles) than using the -40°C isotherm (0.66 for three needles).

Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is emerging as an important regulator in many cancers. Recently, it was found that lncRNA prostate cancer associated transcript 1 (PCAT-1) was up-regulated in lung cancer, playing oncogenic roles. However, the underlying regulatory mechanism of PCAT-1 remains unknown.  Material and methods:   The expression levels of PCAT-1 and miR-324-5p were analyzed by real-time PCR, and RAP1A expression was determined by western blotting. RNA pull-down, luciferase and western blotting assays were used to examine the target relationship between PCAT-1 and miR-324-5p or that between miR-324-5p and RAP1A. The functional effects of PCAT-1 and miR-324-5p were examined using cell viability and cell apoptosis assays.  Results:   PCAT-1 overexpression remarkably promoted cell proliferation and suppressed cell apoptosis. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that PCAT-1 can interact with miR-324-5p and repress its expression, thereby increasing the expression of its target RAP1A. Additionally, rescue experiments revealed that PCAT-1 served as an oncogene partly through sponging miR-324-5p and upregulating RAP1A in lung cancer cells.

Also, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in toll-like receptor (TLR) genes influence PC risk. This pilot study explores interactions between STIs and TLR-related SNPs in relation to PC risk among Jamaican men.  Methods:   This case-control study evaluates two TLR related SNPs in 356 Jamaican men (194 controls and 162 cases) with or without history of STIs using stepwise penalized logistic regression in multivariable analyses.  Results:   Age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-1>.12; p < .001) and IRF3_rs2304206 GG genotype (OR = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.29-0<.78; p = .003) modulated PC risk in people with history of STIs. In the population with no history of STIs, resulting interactions between risk factors did not survive correction for multiple hypothesis testing.  Conclusion:   Overall, an interaction between the IFR3_rs2304206 variant and a history of exposure to STIs leads to greater decrease of PC risk than the presence of polymorphic genotype alone. These findings are suggestive and require further validation. Identification of gene variants along with detection of lifestyle behaviors may contribute to identification of men at a greater risk of PC development in the population.""","""['Bhawna Dubey', 'Maria Jackson', 'Charnita Zeigler-Johnson', 'Karthik Devarajan', 'Rafael E Flores-Obando', 'Norma McFarlane-Anderson', 'Marshall Tulloch-Reid', 'William Aiken', 'Kevin Kimbro', 'Dominique Reed', 'LaCreis R Kidd', 'Denise Gibbs', 'Sudhir Kumar', 'Camille Ragin']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Inflammation polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk in Jamaican men: Role of obesity/body size.', 'Interactions of sequence variants in interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase4 and the toll-like receptor 6-1-10 gene cluster increase prostate cancer risk.', 'MSMB gene variant alters the association between prostate cancer and number of sexual partners.', 'Sexually transmitted infections and prostate cancer risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Insights into the toll-like receptors in sexually transmitted infections.']"""

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown.  Methods:   The expression level of β2 -adrenergic receptor (β2 -AR) in tissue microarray was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The effects of isoproterenol (ISO) or Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling inhibitor on tumor growth were analyzed in proliferation and colony formation assays. The apoptosis of cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. Small hairpin RNA-based knockdown of β2 -AR or Gli1 was validated by Western blot analysis and real-time PCR. Effects of β2 -AR on prostate carcinogenesis in vivo were observed in a mouse xenograft model. The expression levels of the indicated proteins in xenograft tissues were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Expression levels of Shh signaling components and downstream proteins were assessed by immunoblotting.  Results:   We determined that β2 -AR was expressed at significantly higher levels in carcinoma than in normal prostate tissues. β2 -AR signaling also played an essential role in sustaining PCa cell proliferation in vivo and in vitro. We also found that inhibition of Shh signaling or knockdown of Gli1 expression significantly restrained ISO-induced cell proliferation in vitro. ISO alleviated the apoptosis induced by suppressing or knocking down of Gli1. The β2 -AR agonist ISO upregulated the transcription and protein expression of target genes of Shh signaling, including c-Myc, Cyclin D1, and VEGFA. Conversely, knocking down β2 -AR markedly suppressed the expression of Shh components in vivo and in vitro. In Gli1 knockdown cells, ISO failed to increase the expression of target genes of Shh signaling.  Conclusions:   In this study, we uncovered an important role of β2 -AR signaling in regulating the Shh pathway activity in PCa tumorigenesis and provide further insight into the mechanism of the involvement of the Hh signaling pathway. Furthermore, given the efficacy of β2 -adrenergic modulation on PCa, our study might also add evidence for potential therapeutic options of β-blockers for PCa.""","""['Mi Zhang', 'Qianhui Wang', 'Xueqing Sun', 'Qingqing Yin', 'Jinying Chen', 'Linhui Xu', 'Chen Xu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Carnosol inhibits Hedgehog signaling pathway in both LNCaP and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Sonic hedgehog and androgen signaling in tumor and stromal compartments drives epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Loss of androgen signaling in mesenchymal sonic hedgehog responsive cells diminishes prostate development, growth, and regeneration.', 'Prognostic Role of Hedgehog-GLI1 Signaling Pathway in Aggressive and Metastatic Breast Cancers.', 'Hedgehog signaling in prostate growth and benign prostate hyperplasia.', 'Inhibition of signaling downstream of beta-2 adrenoceptor by propranolol in prostate cancer cells.', 'Biobehavioral Pathways and Cancer Progression: Insights for Improving Well-Being and Cancer Outcomes.', 'Neural regulations of the tumor microenvironment.']"""

Levels of miRNA-34a in these fresh tissues were measured by fluorescence quantitative PCR. PC3 cells were divided into non-loaded group and overexpression group. Cells in the non-loaded group were transfected with non-loaded plasmid. Cells in the overexpression group were transfected with miRNA-34a plasmid, and the miRNA-34a level was determined by fluorescence quantitative PCR to confirm the overexpression. Cell proliferation was analyzed by CCK-8 assay. Cell migration rate was measured by cell scratch assay. Flow cytometry was used to detect apoptosis and analyze cell cycle. Western blot was used to measure the expression levels of β-catenin, E-cadherin and Vimentin.  Results:   The expression level of miRNA-34a in prostate cancer tissue was significantly lower than that in prostate paracancerous tissue. Dual-Luciferase reporter gene assay was used to analyze the transcriptional activity of Wnt1 gene. The proliferation and migration of PC3 cells were significantly decreased after overexpression of miRNA-34a, and the differences were statistically significant compared with those in the non-loaded group (p<0.05). Flow cytometry analysis showed that in the overexpression group, the apoptotic rate, as well as the proportion of cells in the G2 phase, was significantly higher than that in the non-loaded group (p<0.05). The β-catenin level in the nucleus of PC3 cells was significantly reduced after overexpression of miRNA-34a. The total protein levels of β-catenin and Vimentin were significantly decreased, whereas the level of E-cadherin in the overexpression group was apparently increased, compared with that in the non-loaded group.

After culture, the cells were treated for 6 h, 12 h and 24 h, respectively. The effects of Lep on the proliferation and invasion of DU145 cells were detected via methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay and transwell chamber assay, respectively. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was carried out to examine the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expressions of ERK1/2, b-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) in DU145 cells after Lep treatment for 24 h. Thereafter, immunofluorescence assay was performed to detect the localization of ERK1/2 protein in prostate cancer DU145 cells. In addition, the expressions of phosphorylated (p)-ERK, ERK1/2 and apoptosis-related proteins, Bcl-2, Bax and cleaved cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase (c-Caspase 3) in prostate cancer DU145 cells after treatment with different concentrations of Lep for 24 h were examined by Western blotting.  Results:   MTT assay results showed that the proliferation rate of DU145 cells increased significantly at 6 h, 12 h and 24 h after 5-320 ng/mL of Lep treatment (p<0.05). Transwell assay manifested that the number of invasive cells was significantly raised after Lep treatment for 24 h (p<0.05). Meanwhile, the invasion ability of cells increased gradually with the elevation of Lep concentration. Subsequent qRT-PCR results demonstrated that after treatment with different concentrations of Lep, the mRNA expressions of ERK1/2 and Bcl-2 rose markedly (p<0.05). However, the mRNA expression of Bax was remarkably down-regulated (p<0.05) with the increase of Lep concentration in a concentration-dependent manner. According to the detection using a laser scanning confocal microscope, ERK1/2 red fluorescence showed punctiform aggregation, which was gradually raised with the increase of Lep concentration for 24 h. Moreover, Western blotting results denoted that with the increase of Lep concentration, the protein expressions of p-ERK, ERK1/2 and Bcl-2 were notably elevated (p<0.05), while those of Bax and c-Caspase 3 were distinctly reduced (p<0.05).

In addition, in silico tools were used to demonstrate the relationship between MTR expression and PRAD risk and survival time.  Results:   The overall results from 10,617 PRAD cases and 40,489 control participants indicated the association of the MTR D919G variant with an increased risk of PRAD (allelic contrast: OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.01 - 1.11; GA vs. AA: OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.02 - 1.14; GG+GA vs. AA: OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.02 - 1.14).

Lack of completion diminishes power to draw conclusions and can be a waste of resources. It is hypothesized that trials with automatic email reminders and past due notifications will have PROM forms submitted more timely with higher patient completion.  Methods:   Automatic emails sent to the research associate were added to selected NRG Oncology trials. Comparisons between trials with and without automatic emails were analyzed using Chi-square tests with respect to patient completion and timeliness of form submission rates. Multivariable analyses were conducted using repeated measures generalized estimating equations. If PROMs were not completed, a form providing the reason why was submitted and counted towards form submission.  Results:   For both disease sites, form submission was significantly higher within 1 month of the form's due date for the studies with automatic emails vs. those without (prostate: 79.7% vs. 75.7%, p < 0.001; breast: 59.2% vs. 31.3%, p < 0.001). No significant differences in patient completion were observed between the breast trials. The prostate trial with automatic emails had significantly higher patient completion but this result was not confirmed in the multivariable analysis.  Conclusions:   Although patient completion rates were higher on trials with automatic emails, there may be confounding factors requiring future study. The automatic emails appeared to have increased the timeliness of form submission, thus supporting their continued use on NRG Oncology trials.""","""['Stephanie L Pugh', 'Joseph P Rodgers', 'Jennifer Moughan', 'Roseann Bonanni', 'Jaskaran Boparai', 'Ronald C Chen', 'James J Dignam', 'Deborah W Bruner']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Qual Life Res""","""['Pre-Visit Digital Messaging Improves Patient-Reported Outcome Measure Participation Prior to the Orthopaedic Ambulatory Visit: Results from a Double-Blinded, Prospective, Randomized Controlled Trial.', 'Association between patient-initiated emails and overall 2-year survival in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy: Evidence from the real-world setting.', 'Development and implementation of PROgmatic: A clinical trial management system for pragmatic multi-centre trials, optimised for electronic data capture and patient-reported outcomes.', 'Digital Breast Tomosynthesis with Hologic 3D Mammography Selenia Dimensions System for Use in Breast Cancer Screening: A Single Technology Assessment Internet.', 'Email for clinical communication between patients/caregivers and healthcare professionals.', 'Managing Critical Patient-Reported Outcome Measures in Oncology Settings: System Development and Retrospective Study.', 'Quantifying the effect email reminders have on patient reported outcome measure returns in a large prostate cancer registry.', 'Quality of Life Implications of Dose-Escalated External Beam Radiation for Localized Prostate Cancer: Results of a Prospective Randomized Phase 3 Clinical Trial, NRG/RTOG 0126.']"""

Systematic, comparative investigations across a broad range of cancer entities are lacking.  Methods:   The FiX study systematically enrolled 2244 cancer patients across 15 entities approximately 2 years after diagnosis. Fatigue was assessed with the multidimensional EORTC QLQ-FA12 questionnaire. Physical, emotional, cognitive, and total fatigue were compared across entities and with normative values of the general population. Differences in patients' characteristics and cancer therapy between entities were taken into account using analyses of covariance models.  Results:   Across all entities, mean physical fatigue levels were significantly higher than age- and sex-matched means of the general population for all cancer entities (all Bonferroni-Holm adjusted P < .01). For most entities also emotional and cognitive fatigue levels were significantly higher than normative values. Age- and sex-standardized physical fatigue prevalence ranged from 31.8% among prostate to 51.7% among liver cancer patients. Differences between entities could not be fully explained by sex, age, BMI, or cancer therapy. Adjusted for these factors, mean physical fatigue was higher for stomach (P = .0004), lung (P = .034), kidney (P = .0011), pancreas (P = .081), and endometrium (P = .022) compared to breast cancer patients. Adjusted means of emotional fatigue were also lowest in breast cancer patients and significantly higher in stomach (P = .0047), bladder (P = .0036), and rectal (P = .0020) cancer patients.  Conclusions:   Physical, emotional, and cognitive fatigue is prevalent in all 15 investigated cancer entities even 2 years after diagnosis.

Methods:   A longitudinal survey study was carried out among 261 prostate cancer patients who received prostate brachytherapy. A total of 48 patients were potent at baseline and they did not receive any supplemental therapy preoperatively. Dosimetry parameters of the whole prostate gland, prostate apex, urethra and rectum were collected using the VariSeed 8.0 treatment planning system (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA, USA). We carried out a logistic regression analysis to clarify the relationship between radiation doses and erectile function deterioration, which was assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function-15 questionnaire.  Results:   The median patient age was 66 years (range 53-70 years) with a median follow-up time of 44 months (36-71 months). The mean total International Index of Erectile Function-15 score decreased from 49.9 at baseline to 34.7 after 12 months (P < 0.001), but gradually plateaued within 36 months. Erectile function deterioration was noted in 32 (66.7%) patients 36 months after prostate brachytherapy. In an analysis of risk factors for erectile function deterioration after prostate brachytherapy, age ≥70 years (P = 0.029), prostate V100 ≥95% (P = 0.024), apex V100 ≥95% (P = 0.024), apex V150 ≥70% (P = 0.009) and apex D90 ≥150 Gy (P = 0.011) correlated with erectile function deterioration. A multivariate analysis identified an age of ≥70 years (odds ratio 7.91, P = 0.024) and apex V150 ≥70% (odds ratio 7.75, P = 0.007) as independent risk factors for erectile function deterioration after prostate brachytherapy.

We analysed Illumina HumanMethylation 450 k array data generated from blood samples from 38 KhoeSan and 42 Bantu, and 6 Europeans. After removing CpG positions associated with annotated and novel polymorphisms and controlling for white blood cell composition, sex, age and technical variation we identified 816 differentially methylated CpG loci, out of which 133 had an absolute beta-value difference of at least 0.05. Notably SLC39A4/ZIP4, which plays a role in zinc transport, was one of the most differentially methylated loci. Although the chronological ages of the KhoeSan are not formally recorded, we compared historically estimated ages to methylation-based calculations.

The role of T cells and their antigenic targets in IIM initiation and progression is poorly understood. T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire sequencing is a powerful approach for characterizing complex T cell responses. However, current TCR sequencing methodologies are complex, expensive, or both, greatly limiting the scale of feasible studies.  Methods:   Here we present Framework Region 3 AmplifiKation sequencing (""FR3AK-seq""), a simplified multiplex PCR-based approach for the ultra-efficient and quantitative analysis of TCR complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) repertoires. By using minimal primer sets targeting a conserved region immediately upstream of CDR3, undistorted amplicons are analyzed via short read, single-end sequencing. We also introduce the novel algorithm Inferring Sequences via Efficiency Projection and Primer Incorporation (""ISEPPI"") for linking CDR3s to their associated variable genes.  Findings:   We find that FR3AK-seq is sensitive and quantitative, performing comparably to two different industry standards. FR3AK-seq and ISEPPI were used to efficiently and inexpensively characterize the T cell infiltrates of surgical muscle biopsies obtained from 145 patients with IIM and controls. A cluster of closely related TCRs was identified in samples from patients with sporadic inclusion body myositis (IBM).  Interpretation:   The ease and minimal cost of FR3AK-seq removes critical barriers to routine, large-scale TCR CDR3 repertoire analyses, thereby democratizing the quantitative assessment of human TCR repertoires in disease-relevant target tissues. Importantly, discovery of closely related TCRs in muscle from patients with IBM provides evidence for a shared antigen-driven T cell response in this disease of unknown pathogenesis.

However, limited evidence exists regarding which men can be selected safely.  Objective:   To externally validate the Gandaglia risk calculator (Gandaglia-RC), designed to predict adverse pathology (AP) at radical prostatectomy (RP) and thus able to improve selection of intermediate-risk PCa patients suitable for AS, and to assess whether addition of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings (MAP model) improves the predictive ability of Gandaglia-RC.  Design, setting, and participants:   This is a retrospective analysis of a single-center cohort of 1284 consecutive men with low- and intermediate-risk PCa treated with RP between 2013 and 2019.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   AP was defined as non-organ-confined disease and/or lymph node invasion and/or pathological grade group≥3 at RP. Logistic regression was used to calculate the predictors of AP; calculated coefficients were used to develop a risk score. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and decision curve analysis were performed to evaluate the net benefit within models.  Results and limitations:   At multivariable analysis, age at surgery, prostate-specific antigen, systematic and targeted biopsy Gleason grade group, MRI prostate volume, Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System score, and MRI extraprostatic extension were significantly associated with AP. The model significantly improved the ability of Gandaglia-RC to predict AP (area under the curve 0.71 vs 0.63 [p<0.0001]). Using a 30% threshold, the proportions of men eligible for AS were 45% and 77% and the risks of AP were 16% and 17%, for Gandaglia-RC and MAP model, respectively.  Conclusions:   Compared with Gandaglia-RC, the MAP model significantly increased the number of patients eligible for AS without significantly increasing the risk of AP at RP.

We identified borough of residence through NYSPACED and used Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) designation to define neighborhood characteristics using United States Census data. We hypothesized that differences exist in use of ALT according to county of residence and neighborhood characteristics. We used multivariable logistic regression to test the association between county of residence and ALT as well as between ALT and PUMA characteristics.  Results:   Our cohort included 40,668 patients.

However, little is known about the clinical outcome of surgery for MSCC from PC. We evaluated both the oncological and functional outcomes of decompression and reconstruction surgery for patients with symptomatic MSCC from PC.  Methods:   We assessed 19 patients who underwent decompression and reconstruction surgery for symptomatic MSCC from PC. Of these 19 patients, 8 had metastatic hormone-naïve PC (mHNPC) and 11 had metastatic castration-resistant PC (mCRPC).  Results:   The median age of the patients with mHNPC and mCRPC was 72 and 65 years, respectively. The median prostate-specific antigen level at the time of diagnosis of MSCC in patients with mHNPC and mCRPC was 910 and 67 ng/mL, respectively. Although two of eight patients (25.0%) with mHNPC were ambulatory preoperatively, six patients (75.0%) were ambulatory postoperatively. Among 11 patients with mCRPC, only 3 (27.3%) were ambulatory preoperatively, while 6 (54.5%) were ambulatory postoperatively. The median postoperative overall survival among patients with mHNPC and mCRPC were not reached and 8 months, respectively.  Conclusions:   Decompression and reconstruction surgery for symptomatic MSCC from PC might contribute to a favorable functional outcome among men with mHNPC and mCRPC. However, its role in improving the oncological outcome remains unclear. The treatment strategy should be chosen by shared decision-making among patients, urologists, radiation oncologists, and orthopedic surgeons.""","""['Yasuhide Miyoshi', 'Takashi Kawahara', 'Masahiro Yao', 'Hiroji Uemura']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Outcome after surgery for metastatic spinal cord compression in 54 patients with prostate cancer.', 'Surgical results of metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): analysis of functional outcome, survival time, and complication.', 'Progressive computed tomography (CT) appearances preceding malignant spinal cord\xa0compression (MSCC) in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Metastatic Spinal Cord Compression: Unraveling the Diagnostic and Therapeutic Challenges.', 'Posterior approaches for symptomatic metastatic spinal cord compression.']"""

In comparison to centers in Europe or the United States, the scarcity of data on these terms might impair design of adequate measures to ameliorate the pandemic's potential damage. The first survey-based analysis revealing regional information is herein presented.  Methods and materials:   From May 6 to May 30, 2020, the American Society for Radiation Oncology's COVID-19 Survey was distributed across Latin America with support of the local national radiation therapy societies. Twenty-six items, including facility demographic and financial characteristics, personnel and patient features, current and expected impact of the pandemic, and research perspectives, were included in the questionnaire.  Results:   Complete responses were obtained from 115 (50%) of 229 practices across 15 countries. Only 2.6% of centers closed during the pandemic. A median of 4 radiation oncologists (1-27) and 9 (1-100) radiation therapists were reported per center. The median number of new patients treated in 2019 was 600 (24-6200). A median 8% (1%-90%) decrease in patient volume was reported, with a median of 53 patients (1-490) remaining under treatment. Estimated revenue reduction was 20% or more in 53% of cases. Shortage of personal protective equipment was reported in 51.3% of centers, and 27% reported personnel shortage due to COVID-19. Reported delays in treatment for low-risk entities included early stage breast cancer (42.6%), low-risk status prostate cancer (67%), and nonmalignant conditions (42.6%). Treatment of COVID-19 patients at designated treatment times and differentiated bunkers were reported in 22.6% and 10.4% of centers, respectively. Telehealth initiatives have been started in 64.3% of facilities to date for on-treatment (29.6%) and posttreatment (34.8%) patients.  Conclusions:   Regional information regarding COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America may help elucidate suitable intervention strategies for personnel and patients. Follow-up surveys will be performed to provide dynamic monitoring the pandemic's impact on radiation therapy services and adoption of ameliorating measures.""","""['David Martinez', 'Gustavo J Sarria', 'Daniel Wakefield', 'Claudio Flores', 'Sameeksha Malhotra', 'Benjamin Li', 'Michael Ehmann', 'David L Schwartz', 'Gustavo R Sarria']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Initial Impact and Operational Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic by American Radiation Oncology Practices.', 'Exploring Urological Experience in the COVID-19 Outbreak: American Confederation of Urology (CAU) Survey.', 'Telemedicine in Radiation Oncology Post-COVID-19 Pandemic: There Is No Turning\xa0Back.', 'Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Ibero-American Urology Residents: Perspective of American Confederation of Urology (CAU).', 'First statement on preparation for the COVID-19 pandemic in large German Speaking University-based radiation oncology departments.', 'Telemedicine in Care of Sarcoma Patients beyond the COVID-19 Pandemic: Challenges and Opportunities.', 'Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer healthcare utilization in southwestern China on March 2021.', 'The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Number of Cancer Patients and Radiotherapy Procedures in the Warmia and Masuria Voivodeship.', 'The worldwide impact of COVID-19 on cancer care: A meta-analysis of surveys published after the first wave of the pandemic.', 'How has the COVID-19 pandemic impacted clinical care and research in Neuro-Oncology?']"""

In this phase II study, stereotactic body radiation treatment was delivered by volumetric modulated arc therapy with flattening filter free beams and was gated using real-time electromagnetic transponder system to maximize precision of radiotherapy and, potentially, to reduce toxicities.  Materials and methods:   Patients affected by histologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) intermediate class of risk were enrolled in this phase II study. Beacon transponders were positioned transrectally within the prostate parenchyma 7 to 10 days before simulation computed tomography scan. The radiotherapy schedule was 38 Gy in 4 fractions delivered every other day. Toxicity assessment was performed according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), v4.0.  Results:   Thirty-six patients were enrolled in this study. Median initial prostate-specific antigen was 7.0 ng/mL (range: 2.3 to 14.0 ng/mL). Median nadir-prostate-specific antigen after treatment was 0.2 ng/mL (range: 0.006 to 4.8 ng/mL). A genitourinary acute toxicity was observed in 21 patients (dysuria grade [G] 1: 41.7%, G2: 16.7%). Gastrointestinal acute toxicity was found in 9 patients (proctitis G1: 19.4%, G2: 5.6%). Late toxicity was mild (genitourinary toxicity G1: 30.6%; G2: 8.3%; gastrointestinal toxicity G1: 13.9%; G2: 19.4%).

The objective of this work was to assess how anxiety modifies the association between red and processed meat consumption and cancer risk in the NutriNet-Santé prospective cohort (2009-2019).  Methods:   Using multi-adjusted Cox models in a sample of 101,269 subjects, we studied the associations between the consumption of red and processed meat, the amount of heme iron coming from these meats and overall, colorectal, prostate, and breast cancer risks, overall and separately among participants with and without anxiety.  Results:   An increase in red and processed meat consumption was associated with an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer in the total population (HR for an increase of 50 g/day = 1.18 (1.01-1.37), p = 0.03).

Exercise and nutrition can reduce fat mass; however, few studies have explored this as a combined pre-surgical intervention in clinical practice.  Purpose:   This study examined the efficacy of a weight loss program for altering body composition in prostate cancer patients prior to robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).  Methods:   A retrospective analysis of 43 overweight and obese prostate cancer patients, aged 47-80 years, who completed a very low-calorie diet (~3000-4000 kJ) combined with moderate-intensity exercise (90 min/day) prior to RARP. Whole body and regional fat mass (FM) and lean mass (LM) were assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry pre- and post-program. Body weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure were assessed weekly, with surgery-related adverse effects recorded at time of surgery and follow-up appointments.  Results:   With a median of 29 days (IQR: 24-35days) on the program, patients significantly (p < 0.001) reduced weight (-7.3 ± 2.9 kg), FM (-5.0 ± 2.6 kg), percent body fat (-3.1 ± 2.5%), trunk FM (-3.4 ± 1.8 kg), LM (-2.4 ± 1.8 kg), and appendicular LM (-1.2 ± 1.0 kg). Lower weight, FM, percent FM, trunk FM, and visceral FM were associated with less surgery-related adverse effects (rs = 0.335 to 0.468, p < 0.010).

Methods:   In this case-control study, fresh prostate tissues and blood samples were collected from 90 individuals, including 58 cases samples with PCa and 32 non-malignant prostate tissue samples as a control group. The expression level of viral genes (E2, E6, and E7) and cellular factors including tumor suppressor proteins (Rb and p53), anti-apoptotic mediators (Bcl-2 and survivin), and some mediators involved in inflammation and angiogenesis was evaluated.  Results:   The presence of the HPV genome was identified in 19 out of the 58 cases (32.7%) and five out of the 32 controls (15.6%). However, there was not any statistically significant relationship between the presence of the HPV genome and PCa (OR = 2.63, 95% C.I = 0.89-7.91, P-value = 0.078). Moreover, the HPV high-risk genotypes 16 and 18 were detected in 47.4% and 31.6% of HPV-infected PCa tissues, respectively. The expression level of the tumor suppressor proteins (Rb and p53) significantly decreased in the HPV-infected samples compared to the HPV negative specimens (P-value = 0.01, P-value = 0.01, respectively). However, the expression level of the anti-apoptotic mediators and those involved in angiogenesis and inflammation significantly increased in the HPV-infected PCa group compared to the HPV-negative PCa and control groups (P-value < 0.05, respectively).  Conclusion:   Our study suggests that although it is not definitely known whether HPV causes PCa, this virus probably modulates PCa cell behavior by affecting inflammation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis mechanisms, which, in turn, promotes tumorigenesis.""","""['Javid Sadri Nahand', 'Maryam Esghaei', 'Seyed Hamidreza Monavari', 'Mohsen Moghoofei', 'Seyed Jalal Kiani', 'Shayan Mostafaei', 'Hamed Mirzaei', 'Farah Bokharaei-Salim']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int Immunopharmacol""","""['Human papillomavirus and prostate cancer: The role of viral expressed proteins in the inhibition of anoikis and induction of metastasis.', 'Human papilloma virus (HPV) and prostate cancer (PCa): The potential role of HPV gene expression and selected cellular MiRNAs in PCa development.', 'Possible role of HPV/EBV coinfection in anoikis resistance and development in prostate cancer.', 'Detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA prevalence and p53 codon 72 (Arg72Pro) polymorphism in prostate cancer in a Greek group of patients.', 'Prostate cancer and new insights in angiogenesis.', 'Genomic alterations related to HPV infection status in a cohort of Chinese prostate cancer patients.', 'Integrative analysis of gene expression and DNA methylation to identify biomarkers of non-genital warts induced by low-risk human papillomaviruses infection.', 'Human microbiomes in cancer development and therapy.', 'Presence of HPV in prostate tissue from patients submitted to prostate biopsy.', 'Multiple pathogens and prostate cancer.']"""

Results:   We received responses from 76 institutions (49.7%). Forty-three of these institutions performed ReRT-BT and 42 institutions (55%) performed ReRT-BT during 2009-2018. However, 29 of the 42 institutions (69%) reported difficulty in obtaining ReRT-BT case information from their respective databases. Almost all the institutions encountered insufficient database system to extract details about the ReRT-BT cases. Responses from 33 institutions included the number of ReRT-BT cases; this increased from 90 in the period 2009-2013 (institution median = 0.5; 0-16) to 172 in the period 2014-2018 (institution median = 2; 0-26). Nine institutions had to perform ReRT-BT for more than one case per year. The major location for cancer treatment was the pelvis (94%), followed by the head and neck (5%) and others (1%). In six site-specific scenarios, barring uterine corpus cancer recurrence, more than 90% of radiation oncologists agreed to perform ReRT-BT, whereas other areas (head and neck, prostate, and rectal cancer) gained 16-37% agreement.  Conclusions:   This decade saw an increase in the number of ReRT-BT cases in Japan and radiation oncologists' interest in ReRT-BT as a viable therapeutic option.

Materials and methods:   To evaluate the optimum reference period for replanning, we analyzed 1483 sets of daily CT (dCT) images acquired from 40 prostate cancer patients and measured the daily rectal movement along the anterior-posterior direction based on the simulator CT (sCT) images and dCT images. We calculated daily dose distributions based on initial plans on the sCT images and replans on the dCT images for 13 representative patients, and evaluated daily dose volume histograms (DVHs) for the prostate, seminal vesicles, and rectum.  Results:   The rectal anterior side on the dCT images around the seminal vesicles largely deviated toward the anterior side relative to the position on the reference sCT images, but the deviation decreased by referring to the dCT images and became nearly zero when we referred to the dCT images after 10-day treatment. The daily DVH values for the prostate showed good dose coverage. For six patients showing rectal movement toward the anterior side, the daily rectal DVH (V77% ) showed a 3.0 ± 1.7 cc excess from the initial plan and this excess was correlated with 9.9 ± 6.8 mm rectal movement. To identify the patients (37.5% in total) for whom the replanning on the 10th-day and 20th-day CT images reduced the V77% excess to 0.4 ± 1.5 cc and -0.2 ± 1.3 cc, respectively, we evaluated the accumulated mean doses with a 1.2 cc criterion.  Conclusion:   Our data demonstrate that the daily movement of the rectal anterior side tends to move toward the anterior side, which results in a rectal overdose, and the mean of the movement gradually decreases with the passage of days. In such cases, replanning with the reference CT after 10 days is effective to spare the rectal dose.""","""['Yoshikazu Maeda', 'Yoshitaka Sato', 'Kazutaka Yamamoto', 'Hiroyasu Tamamura', 'Makoto Sasaki', 'Nobukazu Fuwa', 'Shigeyuki Takamatsu', 'Kyo Kume']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Positioning accuracy and daily dose assessment for prostate cancer treatment using in-room CT image guidance at a proton therapy facility.', 'Effects of organ motion on proton prostate treatments, as determined from analysis of daily CT imaging for patient positioning.', 'Evaluation of the dosimetric impact of interfractional anatomical variations on prostate proton therapy using daily in-room CT images.', 'Effect of anatomic motion on proton therapy dose distributions in prostate cancer treatment.', 'Dosimetric uncertainty in prostate cancer proton radiotherapy.', 'A systematic review of volumetric image guidance in proton therapy.', 'Dosimetric advantages of daily adaptive strategy in IMPT for high-risk prostate cancer.']"""

This decision then was modified in 2018 to a grade C for men aged 55 to 69 years. The authors hypothesized that changes in screening practices would reduce survival outcomes for both Black and White men but maintain racial discrepancies in outcomes.  Methods:   Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, the authors examined PCa-specific survival based on race and year of diagnosis. The period between January 2010 and December 2012 was categorized as the pre-USPSTF era, whereas the period between January 2014 and December 2016 was classified as the post-USPSTF era. The year 2013 was considered the transition year and was excluded from the analysis.  Results:   A total of 49,388 men were identified in the pre-USPSTF era who were diagnosed with PCa, approximately 83.7% of whom were White and 16.3% of whom were Black. In the post-USPSTF era, a total of 41,829 men were diagnosed with PCa, approximately 82.7% of whom were White and 17.3% of whom were Black. When compared with the pre-USPSTF era, men diagnosed in the post-USPSTF era were found to have more adverse clinical features. In the pre-USPSTF era, White men were less likely to die of PCa than Black men. This survival disparity between White and Black men was no longer observed in the post-USPSTF era.  Conclusions:   In men diagnosed with PCa between 2014 and 2016, a survival disparity between White and Black men was not observed due to a decrease in survival among White men while the survival of Black men remained steady.""","""['Isaac E Kim Jr', 'Thomas L Jang', 'Sinae Kim', 'Parth K Modi', 'Eric A Singer', 'Sammy E Elsamra', 'Isaac Yi Kim']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Trends in the Incidence of Fatal Prostate Cancer in the United States by Race.', 'Rates of clinically significant prostate cancer in African Americans increased significantly following the 2012 US Preventative Services Task Force recommendation against prostate specific antigen screening: A Single Institution Retrospective Study.', 'Racial disparities in prostate cancer outcome among prostate-specific antigen screening eligible populations in the United States.', 'Do African American men have lower survival from prostate cancer compared with White men?

Here, we present a side-by-side comparison of renal cortical PSMA PET/CT and DMSA images of an adult patient with chronic recurring pyelonephritis. Methods: Our prospective study was approved by the Ethical Committees. DMSA images (multiple planar and SPECT) were obtained 3 h after intravenous injection of 111 MBq (3 mCi) of 99mTc-DMSA. On a separate day, we obtained PET/CT images of the kidneys 60 min after intravenous injection of 74 MBq (2 mCi) of 68Ga-PSMA-11 after the patient provided written informed consent. Results: The patient was a 46-y-old woman with history of chronic recurring pyelonephritis. Both DMSA scan and PSMA PET/CT demonstrated slight cortical thinning with mildly reduced uptake in the upper pole of the right kidney, with no significant cortical defects. There was an excellent distribution of activity in the renal cortex and better image resolution with PSMA PET than with DMSA scan. Non-attenuation-corrected PSMA PET images also showed the same findings, with reasonable image quality.

In colorectal cancer (CRC), several nomograms are available to predict different outcomes based on the use of tumour specific features. Our objective is to provide an accurate and explainable prediction of the risk to die within 10 years after CRC diagnosis, by incorporating the tumour features and the patient medical and demographic information.  Design:   In the prostate, lung, colorectal and ovarian cancer screening (PLCO) Trial, participants (n=154 900) were randomised to screening with flexible sigmoidoscopy, with a repeat screening at 3 or 5 years, or to usual care. We selected patients who were diagnosed with CRC during the follow-up to train a gradient-boosted model to predict the risk to die within 10 years after CRC diagnosis. Using Shapley values, we determined the 20 most relevant features and provided explanation to prediction.  Results:   During the follow-up, 2359 patients were diagnosed with CRC. Median follow-up was 16.8 years (14.4-18.9) for mortality. In total, 686 patients (29%) died from CRC during the follow-up.

We introduce a new algorithm, Reconstructing Cancer Karyotypes (RCK), to reconstruct haplotype-specific karyotypes of one or more rearranged cancer genomes from DNA sequencing data from a bulk tumor sample. RCK leverages evolutionary constraints on the somatic mutational process in cancer to reduce ambiguity in the deconvolution of admixed sequencing data into multiple haplotype-specific cancer karyotypes. RCK models mixtures containing an arbitrary number of derived genomes and allows the incorporation of information both from short-read and long-read DNA sequencing technologies. We compare RCK to existing approaches on 17 primary and metastatic prostate cancer samples. We find that RCK infers cancer karyotypes that better explain the DNA sequencing data and conform to a reasonable evolutionary model.

Due to the excellent optical properties of carbon dots (CDs), CDs-based fluorescent detection methods have attracted increasing attention in bioanalytics. Signal reporters using CDs labeled hairpin DNA, based on Föster resonance energy transfer (FRET), have shown promise for the sensitive detection of biomarkers. In this work, a new method for sensitive biomarker detection using an enzyme-free amplified fluorescence strategy was developed. The strategy was based on FRET between CDs and graphene oxide (GO) combined with catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA). In the absence of the target, the CD-labeled hairpin DNA adsorb onto GO via hydrophobic and π-π stacking interactions, resulting in a FRET quenching of the CDs fluorescence. The introduction of the target could trigger the CHA circuits to form Y-shaped double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), resulting in a recovery of the CD's fluorescence signal. This novel strategy was successfully applied for the selective detection of prostate specific antigen (PSA) with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.22 ng mL-1 (3σ/k). Additionally, the method could be used to detect carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) with LOD of 0.56 ng mL-1 (3σ/k) and 80 nM (3σ/k), respectively.

In this study, we present the discovery and mechanism study of a phenomenon of Hg2+ pre-reduction that the concentration of Hg2+ decreased when it was mixed with the reductants (ascorbic acid (AA), SnCl2, or NaBH4/KBH4) over long-time reaction (hours) by CVG-AFS and ICP-MS. A homogeneous Cu2+ assay method was developed based on the competition reaction of Cu2+ and Hg2+ for consuming AA, and its application in the detection of pyrophosphate (PPi) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was investigated based on the PPi complexation with Cu2+, and ALP hydrolyzation of PPi using CVG-AFS as a representative detector.

IC50 studies were performed for peptides 1/2 and their respective Re-1/2 complexes in a binding assay utilizing GRPR-expressing human PC-3 prostate cancer cells and [125I]I-Tyr4-BBN as the competing ligand. The 99mTc/186Re-complexes were identified by HPLC co-injection with their Re-analogues. All tracers were challenged in vitro at 37 °C against cysteine/histidine (phosphate-buffered saline 10 mM, pH 7.4) and rat serum. Biodistribution and micro-SPECT/CT imaging of [99mTc]Tc-1/2 and [186Re]Re-2 were performed in PC-3 tumor-bearing ICR SCID mice.  Results:   High in vitro receptor affinity (IC50 2-3 nM) was demonstrated for all compounds. The 99mTc/186Re-tracers were found to be hydrophilic (log D7.4 ≤ - 1.35) and highly stable. Biodistribution in PC-3 xenografted mice revealed good tumor uptake (%ID/g at 1 h: 4.3 ± 0.7 for [99mTc]Tc-1, 8.3 ± 0.9 for [99mTc]Tc-2 and 4.2 ± 0.8 for [186Re]Re-2) with moderate retention over 24 h. Rapid renal clearance was observed for [99mTc]Tc-2 and [186Re]Re-2 (> 84 % at 4 h), indicating favorable pharmacokinetics. Micro-SPECT/CT images for the 99mTc-tracers clearly visualized PC-3 tumors in agreement with the biodistribution data and with superior imaging properties found for [99mTc]Tc-2.  Conclusions:   [99mTc]Tc-2 shows promise for further development as a GRPR-imaging agent. [186Re]Re-2 demonstrated very similar in vivo behavior to [99mTc]Tc-2, and further studies are therefore justified to explore the theranostic potential of our approach for targeting of GRPR-positive cancers.""","""['George Makris', 'Rajendra P Bandari', 'Marina Kuchuk', 'Silvia S Jurisson', 'Charles J Smith', 'Heather M Hennkens']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Mol Imaging Biol""","""['Somatostatin receptor targeting with hydrophilic 99mTc/186ReTc/Re-tricarbonyl NODAGA and NOTA complexes.', 'p-NCS-Bn-NODAGA as a bifunctional chelator for radiolabeling with the 186Re/99mTc-tricarbonyl core: Radiochemistry with model complexes and a GRPR-targeting peptide.', 'NOTA and NODAGA 99mTcTc- and 186ReRe-Tricarbonyl Complexes: Radiochemistry and First Example of a 99mTcTc-NODAGA Somatostatin Receptor-Targeting Bioconjugate.', '99mTc(v)O-Gly-Gly-Cys-Orn-Orn-Orn-Bombesin2-14.', '99mTc-labeled N40,Pro1,Tyr4bombesin.', 'Optimization of the Pharmacokinetic Profile of 99mTcTc-N4-Bombesin Derivatives by Modification of the Pharmacophoric Gln-Trp Sequence.', 'Bifunctional chelators for radiorhenium: past, present and future outlook.']"""

The randomized PREFERE trial (DRKS00004405) aimed to assess noninferiority of active surveillance (AS), external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT), or brachytherapy by permanent seed implantation (PSI) vs. radical prostatectomy (RP) for these patients.  Methods:   PREFERE was planned to enroll 7600 patients. The primary endpoint was disease specific survival. Patients with PCa stage ≤ cT2a, cN0/X, M0, PSA ≤ 10 ng/ml and Gleason-Score ≤ 3 + 4 at reference pathology were eligible. Patients were allowed to exclude one or two of the four modalities, which yielded eleven combinations for randomization. Sixty-nine German study centers were engaged in PREFERE.  Results:   Of 2251 patients prescreened between 2012 and 2016, 459 agreed to participate in PREFERE. Due to this poor accrual, the trial was stopped. In 345 patients reference pathology confirmed inclusion criteria. Sixty-nine men were assigned to RP, 53 to EBRT, 93 to PSI, and 130 to AS. Forty patients changed treatment shortly after randomization, 21 to AS. Forty-eight AS patients with follow-up received radical treatment. Median follow-up was 19 months. Five patients died, none due to PCa; 8 had biochemical progression after radical therapy. Treatment-related acute grade 3 toxicity was reported in 3 RP patients and 2 PSI patients.  Conclusions:   In this prematurely closed trial, we observed an unexpected high rate of termination of AS and an increased toxicity related to PSI.

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed patients' records of prostate cancer patients with bone metastasis who were treated with zoledronic acid or denosumab between 1/Dec/2008 and 31/Mar/2019. ARONJ-free survival rate was analyzed with Kaplan-Meier analysis, and risk factors for ARONJ were analyzed with Cox proportional hazard model.  Results:   We identified 124 and 67 patients treated with zoledronic acid and denosumab, respectively. Seventy-six patients were hormone sensitive, and 115 patients were castration resistant when they started bone-modifying agents (BMA). Twenty-eight patients developed ARONJ during the observation period (median: 23 months, range 1-130 months). Their number of doses of BMA ranged 3-69 (median: 21.5). The 2-year ARONJ-free survival rate was 91.1%, and the 5-year ARONJ-free survival rate was 72.5%. There was no significant difference in the incidence rate of ARONJ between zoledronic acid and denosumab. However, multivariate analysis revealed that use of denosumab (hazard ratio [HR] 3.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-13.31; p = 0.0484), serum calcium < 9.2 mg/dL (HR 3.16, 95% CI 1.10-9.13; p = 0.033)), and concomitant or prior use of chemotherapeutic agents (HR 4.71, 95% CI 1.51-14.71; p = 0.0076) were independent risk factors for the development of ARONJ.  Conclusion:   Almost one-quarter of patients had a risk of developing ARONJ within 5 years after starting BMA. Low serum calcium, use of chemotherapeutic agents, and use of denosumab might contribute to the development of ARONJ.""","""['Yasutomo Nakai', 'Tomohiro Kanaki', 'Akinaru Yamamoto', 'Ryo Tanaka', 'Yoshiyuki Yamamoto', 'Akira Nagahara', 'Masashi Nakayama', 'Ken-Ichi Kakimoto', 'Miki Ishibashi', 'Kazuo Nishimura']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Bone Miner Metab""","""['Antiresorptive agent-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (ARONJ) in urological malignancies: a multi-center retrospective study.', 'Risk Factors of Antiresorptive Agent-Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw in Prostate Cancer Patients with Bone Metastases.', 'Incidence of Antiresorptive Agent-Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw in Urologic Cancers.', 'Antiresorptive Agent-Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ARONJ): A Twist of Fate in the Bone.', 'Osteonecrosis of the Jaw in Patients Receiving Bone-Targeted Therapies: An Overview--Part I.', 'Management of bone metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'Evolution of Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) and Its New Emerging Modalities in Prostate Cancer: An Update for Practicing Urologists, Clinicians and Medical Providers.', 'Risk evaluation of denosumab and zoledronic acid for medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw in patients with bone metastases: a propensity score-matched analysis.', 'Antiresorptive agent-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (ARONJ) in urological malignancies: a multi-center retrospective study.']"""

Methods:   Using comprehensive genomic profiling (315 genes, >500× coverage), samples were analyzed for alterations in activating/sensitizing cyclin genes (CDK4 amplification, CDK6 amplification, CCND1, CCND2, CCND3, CDKN2B [loss], CDKN2A [loss], SMARCB1), hormone genes (estrogen receptor 1 [ESR1], androgen receptor [AR]), and co-alterations in genes leading to cyclin inhibitor therapeutic resistance (RB1 and CCNE1).  Results:   Alterations in at least one cyclin activating/sensitizing gene occurred in 24% of malignancies. Tumors that frequently harbored at least one cyclin alteration were brain gliomas (47.1%), esophageal (40.3%) and bladder cancer (37.9%), and mesotheliomas (37.9%). The most frequent alterations included CDKN2A (13.9%) and CDKN2B loss (12.5%). Examples of unique patterns of alterations included CCND1 amplification in breast cancer (17.3%); CDK4 alterations in sarcomas (12%); CCND2 in testicular cancer (23.4%), and SMARCB1 mutations in kidney cancer (3% overall, 90% in malignant rhabdoid tumors). Alterations in resistance genes RB1 and CCNE1 affected 7.2% and 3.6% of samples. Co-occurrence analysis demonstrated a lower likelihood of concomitant versus isolated alterations in cyclin activating/sensitizing and resistance genes (odds ratio [OR], 0.35; p < .001), except in colorectal, cervical, and small intestine cancers. AR and cyclin activating/sensitizing alterations in prostate cancer co-occurred more frequently (vs. AR alterations and wild-type cyclin activating/sensitizing alterations) (OR, 1.79; p < .001) as did ESR1 and cyclin activating/sensitizing alterations in breast (OR, 1.62; p < .001) and cervical cancer (OR, 4.08; p = .04) (vs. ESR1 and cyclin wild-type activating/sensitizing alterations).  Conclusion:   Cyclin pathway alterations vary according to tumor type/histology, informing opportunities for targeted therapy, including for rare cancers.  Implications for practice:   Cyclin pathway genomic abnormalities are frequent in human solid tumors, with substantial variation according to tumor site and histology.

This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of using PET/CT imaging with [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 in HCC and its impact on patient management.  Methods:   Fifteen patients (13 men and two women; aged 55.6 ± 18.2 years) with HCC were enrolled in this prospective, single-institution study. All patients underwent contrast-enhanced MRI/CT, [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, and histopathological verification of lesions.  Results:   No radiopharmaceutical-related adverse events were noted. Visual interpretation showed increased accumulation of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 in all HCC patients. The tumor-to-liver ratio (TLR) was 3.6 ± 2.1, and the maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was 13.5 ± 7.1.

However, the poor bioavailability, low stability on gastrointestinal systems, and fast plasma elimination limit further clinical applications of Ginsenoside Rh2 for cancer treatments. In this study, a novel formulation of niosomal Ginsenoside Rh2 was prepared using the thin film hydration technique.  Methods:   The niosomal formulation contained Span 60 and cholesterol, and cationic lipid DOTAP was evaluated by determining particle size distribution, encapsulation efficiency, the polydispersity index (PDI), and surface morphology. The cytotoxic effects of free Ginsenoside Rh2 and Ginsenoside Rh2-loaded niosomes were determined using the MTT method in the PC3 prostate cancer cell line. For the investigation of the in vitro cellular uptake of Ginsenoside Rh2-loaded niosome, two formulations were prepared: the Ginsenoside Rh2-loaded niosomal formula containing 5% DOTAP and the Ginsenoside Rh2-loaded niosomal formula without DOTAP.  Results:   The mean size, DPI, zeta potential, and encapsulation efficiency of the Ginsenoside Rh2-loaded nanoniosomal formulation containing DOTAP were 93.5±2.1 nm, 0.203±0.01, +4.65±0.65, and 98.32% ±2.4, respectively. The niosomal vesicles were found to be round and have a smooth surface. The release profile of Ginsenoside Rh2 from niosome was biphasic. Furthermore, a two-fold reduction in the Ginsenoside Rh2 concentration was measured when Ginsenoside Rh2 was administered in a nanoniosomal form compared to free Ginsenoside Rh2 solutions in the PC3 prostate cancer cell line. After storage for 90 days, the encapsulation efficiency, vesicle size, PDI, and zeta potential of the optimized formulation did not significantly change compared to the freshly prepared samples.

The objective of this work was to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) system for automated detection and localization of PTEN loss on immunohistochemically (IHC) stained sections. PTEN loss was assessed using IHC in two prostate tissue microarrays (TMA) (internal cohort, n = 272 and external cohort, n = 129 patients). TMA cores were visually scored for PTEN loss by pathologists and, if present, spatially annotated. Cores from each patient within the internal TMA cohort were split into 90% cross-validation (N = 2048) and 10% hold-out testing (N = 224) sets. ResNet-101 architecture was used to train core-based classification using a multi-resolution ensemble approach (×5, ×10, and ×20). For spatial annotations, single resolution pixel-based classification was trained from patches extracted at ×20 resolution, interpolated to ×40 resolution, and applied in a sliding-window fashion. A final AI-based prediction model was created from combining multi-resolution and pixel-based models. Performance was evaluated in 428 cores of external cohort. From both cohorts, a total of 2700 cores were studied, with a frequency of PTEN loss of 14.5% in internal (180/1239) and external 13.5% (43/319) cancer cores. The final AI-based prediction of PTEN status demonstrated 98.1% accuracy (95.0% sensitivity, 98.4% specificity; median dice score = 0.811) in internal cohort cross-validation set and 99.1% accuracy (100% sensitivity, 99.0% specificity; median dice score = 0.804) in internal cohort test set. Overall core-based classification in the external cohort was significantly improved in the external cohort (area under the curve = 0.964, 90.6% sensitivity, 95.7% specificity) when further trained (fine-tuned) using 15% of cohort data (19/124 patients).

Methods:   To assess practice patterns of BTT use and its associations with clinical outcomes in a high-volume center in the modern era of metastatic CRPC management, a retrospective cohort of patients treated for mCRPC with BM between 2007 and 2017 was identified from a single institutions clinical research database. Study endpoints included time from the diagnosis of CRPC to the onset of SRE or OS. Cox proportional hazards model assessed association of BTT use with time to first SRE and OS.  Results:   In total, 249 patients were identified; median follow-up was 7.7 (95%CI: 5.7-10.2) years. On multivariable analysis, patients with 4 or more BM at diagnosis of mCRPC who received BTT with abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide as first line therapy had a 42% reduced risk of developing an SRE (HR 0.58; 95%CI: 0.36-0.95) compared to those who never received BTT or received it in second line. No such effect was observed in patients with 1-3 BM. No OS difference was noted in patients who received BTT, whether with first line therapy or without.

In the present study, we found microRNA-107 (miR-107) enhanced radiosensitivity by regulating granulin (GRN) in prostate cancer (PC-3) cells. MiR-107 was downregulated and GRN was upregulated in response to ionizing radiation in PC-3 cells. Overexpression of miR-107 and knockdown of GRN promoted the sensitivity of PC3 cells to ionizing radiation. By rescue experiments of GRN, we revealed that radiosensitivity enhanced by miR-107 can be attenuated by GRN overexpression in PC-3 cells. Furthermore, we showed miR-107 enhanced radiation-induced G1/S phase arrest and G2/M phase transit, and identify delayed apoptosis by suppressing p21 and phosphorylation of CHK2.

Objective:   To evaluate the impact of a 3D model with AR (AR-3D model), to guide nerve sparing (NS) during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP), on surgical planning.  Design, setting, and participants:   Twenty-six consecutive patients with diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa) and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) results available were scheduled for AR-3D NS RARP.  Intervention:   Segmentation of mpMRI and creation of 3D virtual models were achieved. To develop AR guidance, the surgical DaVinci video stream was sent to an AR-dedicated personal computer, and the 3D virtual model was superimposed and manipulated in real time on the robotic console.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The concordance of localisation of the index lesion between the 3D model and the pathological specimen was evaluated using a prostate map of 32 specific areas. A preliminary surgical plan to determinate the extent of the NS approach was recorded based on mpMRI. The final surgical plan was reassessed during surgery by implementation of the AR-3D model guidance.  Results and limitations:   The positive surgical margin (PSM) rate was 15.4% in the overall patient population; three patients (11.5%) had PSMs at the level of the index lesion. AR-3D technology changed the NS surgical plan in 38.5% of men on patient-based and in 34.6% of sides on side-based analysis, resulting in overall appropriateness of 94.4%. The 3D model revealed 70%, 100%, and 92% of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, respectively, at the 32-area map analysis.  Conclusions:   AR-3D guided surgery is useful for improving the real-time identification of the index lesion and allows changing of the NS approach in approximately one out of three cases, with overall appropriateness of 94.4%.

Moreover, ultrasound-targeted nanobubble destruction (UTND) provides an effective way to deliver drugs, effectively increasing the content of the drug in the tumour area and reducing potential side effects, thereby successfully contributing to the treatment of tumours.  Results:   In this study, we prepared multifunctional nanobubbles (NBs) carrying indocyanine green (ICG) and paclitaxel (PTX) (ICG-PTX NBs) and studied their applications in ultrasound imaging of prostate cancer as well as their therapeutic effects on prostate cancer when combined with UTND. ICG-PTX NBs were prepared by the mechanical oscillation method. The particle size and zeta potential of the ICG-PTX NBs were 469.5 ± 32.87 nm and - 21.70 ± 1.22 mV, respectively. The encapsulation efficiency and drug loading efficiency of ICG were 68% and 2.52%, respectively. In vitro imaging experiments showed that ICG-PTX NBs were highly amenable to multimodal imaging, including ultrasound, photoacoustic and fluorescence imaging, and the imaging effect was positively correlated with their concentration. The imaging effects of tumour xenografts also indicated that ICG-PTX NBs were of good use for multimodal imaging. In experiments testing the growth of PC-3 cells in vitro and tumour xenografts in vivo, the ICG-PTX NBs + US group showed more significant inhibition of cell proliferation and the promotion of cell apoptosis compared to the other groups (P < 0.05). Blood biochemical analysis of the six groups showed that the levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), phenylalanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum creatinine (CRE) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in the ICG-PTX NBs and the ICG-PTX NBs + US groups were significantly lower than those in the PTX group (P < 0.05). Moreover, H&E staining of tissue sections from vital organs showed no obvious abnormalities in the ICG-PTX NBs and the ICG-PTX NBs + US groups.  Conclusions:   ICG-PTX NBs can be used as a non-invasive, pro-apoptotic contrast agent that can achieve multimodal imaging, including ultrasound, fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging, and can succeed in the local treatment of prostate cancer providing a potential novel method for integrated research on prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment.""","""['Minmin Lan', 'Lianhua Zhu', 'Yixuan Wang', 'Daijia Shen', 'Kejing Fang', 'Yu Liu', 'Yanli Peng', 'Bin Qiao', 'Yanli Guo']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Nanobiotechnology""","""['Targeted Nanobubbles Carrying Indocyanine Green for Ultrasound, Photoacoustic and Fluorescence Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', 'Folate-receptor-targeted laser-activable poly(lactide-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles loaded with paclitaxel/indocyanine green for photoacoustic/ultrasound imaging and chemo/photothermal therapy.', 'Preparation Of Nanobubbles Modified With A Small-Molecule CXCR4 Antagonist For Targeted Drug Delivery To Tumors And Enhanced Ultrasound Molecular Imaging.', 'Multifunctional microbubbles and nanobubbles for photoacoustic imaging.', 'Indocyanine green-incorporating nanoparticles for cancer theranostics.', 'Perturbing plasma membrane lipid: a new paradigm for tumor nanotherapeutics.', 'Ultrasound and Nanomedicine for Cancer-Targeted Drug Delivery: Screening, Cellular Mechanisms and Therapeutic Opportunities.', 'Near infrared light fluorescence imaging-guided biomimetic nanoparticles of extracellular vesicles deliver indocyanine green and paclitaxel for hyperthermia combined with chemotherapy against glioma.']"""

We therefore aimed to investigate these in a large sample of patients with common cancers.  Methods:   We analysed data on 19,966 patients with common cancers (breast, colorectal, gynaecological, lung and prostate) who had attended specialist NHS outpatient clinics in Scotland, UK. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) data were linked with demographic, cancer and mortality data. We estimated the independent associations of depression (HADS depression score) and anxiety (HADS anxiety score) with survival by fitting (separately for each cancer) Cox proportional hazards models which incorporated cubic splines to allow for non-linear associations. We also adjusted for potential confounders.  Results:   The median time from HADS completion to death or censoring was 1.9 years. Greater depression was found to be strongly associated with worse survival from all cancers. When adjusted for anxiety, this association remained in males and increased in females. Greater anxiety was also associated with worse survival in nearly all cancers. However, when adjusted for depression, the association of anxiety with worse survival was lost. In females the association reversed direction so that greater anxiety was associated with better survival.

Detection rates and positive core rates of PCa and clinically significant cancer (CSC) were evaluated.  Results:   In concurrent MRTB and SB, PCa and CSC detection rates were 18.9% and 9.4% for PI-RADS score 3, 45.9% and 32.4% for PI-RADS score 4, and 82.1% and 72.6% for PI-RADS score 5, respectively. Overall detection rate of CSCs (40.0%) for concurrent MRTB and SB was significantly higher than that of MRTB (34.4%, p = 0.004) or SB alone (27.7%, p < 0.001): an increase of 5.6% (16 patients) compared with MRTB alone. For patients with PI-RADS score 4 or 5, the CSC detection rate of concurrent MRTB and SB was 47.0%, an increase of 6.1% when compared with MRTB (40.9%) only (p < 0.001).

While multiple prediction tools exist to support decision making, their discriminative ability remains modest, which hampers usage and utility. We examined whether combining patient reported and claims based health measures into prediction models improves performance.  Materials and methods:   Using SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results)-CAHPS (Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) we identified men 65 years old or older diagnosed with prostate cancer from 2004 to 2013 and extracted 4 types of data, including demographics, cancer information, claims based health measures and patient reported health measures. Next, we compared the performance of 5 nested competing risk regression models for other cause mortality. Additionally, we assessed whether adding new health measures to established prediction models improved discriminative ability.  Results:   Among 3,240 cases 246 (7.6%) died of prostate cancer while 631 (19.5%) died of other causes. The National Cancer Institute Comorbidity Index score was associated but weakly correlated with patient reported overall health (p <0.001, r=0.21). For predicting other cause mortality the 10-year area under the receiver operating characteristic curve improved from 0.721 (demographics only) to 0.755 with cancer information and to 0.777 and 0.812 when adding claims based and patient reported health measures, respectively. The full model generated the highest value of 0.820. Models based on existing tools also improved in their performance with the incorporation of new data types as predictor variables (p <0.001).  Conclusions:   Prediction models for life expectancy that combine patient reported and claims based health measures outperform models that incorporate these measures separately. However, given the modest degree of improvement, the implementation of life expectancy tools should balance model performance with data availability and fidelity.""","""['Hung-Jui Tan', 'Xi Zhou', 'Brooke N Spratte', 'Stephen McMahon', 'Matthew E Nielsen', 'Jennifer Lund', 'Alex H S Harris', 'Angela B Smith', 'Ethan Basch']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Patient Reported vs Claims Based Measures of Health for Modeling Life Expectancy in Men with Prostate Cancer.

It has many excellent features such as tumor targeting ability, biocompatibility and low toxicity. Therefore, we conjugated docetaxel (DTX) to GO-PEG molecule and investigate its anticancer efficacy in prostate cancer cell line (DU-145). In order to obtain GO-PEG-DTX molecules, we conjugated the DTX via bonds to PEG chains pegylated to the GO surface. We also investigated the stability of GO-PEG-DTX in different biological fluids such as cell mediums, PBS and water in vitro conditions. GO-PEG-DTX has the highest zeta potential in water. In the current research SEM, UV-Vis, and FTIR analyses and zeta potential were utilized for the characterization of nano-sized GO-PEG-DTX. Anticancer efficacy of GO-PEG-DTX were then investigated in DU-145 prostate cancer cell line using MTT metod. The prostate cancer cells were treated by different concentrations of GO-PEG-DTX, GO-PEG, GO, and DTX (1-100 µg/ml) during 24, 48 and 72 h. The spectrophotometric analyzed values at 570 nm were recorded and analysed with Graphpad Prism7. IC50 growth inhibition values was determined. The data showed that the GO-PEG-DTX had a highly effective anticancer activity on prostate cancer cell lines after 24, 48 and 72 hours compared to other molecules. GO-PEG-DTX was found statistically significant in the DU-145 cell line (***p < 0.0001, **p < 0.001, and *p < 0.01). As a result, it can be said that PEGylated GO is an excellent nanocarrier system for the high anticancer activity of DTX.

Further, it is unclear if self-regulatory behavior change techniques (BCTs) can improve exercise adherence in cancer populations. We aimed to (1) describe exercise adherence in terms of frequency, intensity, time, type (FITT-principles) and dropouts, and (2) determine the effect of specific self-regulatory BCTs on exercise adherence in patients participating in an exercise intervention during curative cancer treatment.  Methods:   This study was a secondary analysis using data from a Swedish multicentre RCT. In a 2×2 factorial design, 577 participants recently diagnosed with curable breast, colorectal or prostate cancer were randomized to 6 months of high (HI) or low-to-moderate intensity (LMI) exercise, with or without self-regulatory BCTs (e.g., goal-setting and self-monitoring). The exercise program included supervised group-based resistance training and home-based endurance training. Exercise adherence (performed training/prescribed training) was assessed using attendance records, training logs and heart rate monitors, and is presented descriptively. Linear regression and logistic regression were used to assess the effect of self-regulatory BCTs on each FITT-principle and dropout rates, according to intention-to-treat.  Results:   For resistance training (groups with vs without self-regulatory BCTs), participants attended on average 52% vs 53% of prescribed sessions, performed 79% vs 76% of prescribed intensity, and 80% vs 77% of prescribed time. They adhered to exercise type in 71% vs 68% of attended sessions. For endurance training (groups with vs without self-regulatory BCTs), participants performed on average 47% vs 51% of prescribed sessions, 57% vs 62% of prescribed intensity, and 71% vs 72% of prescribed time. They adhered to exercise type in 79% vs 78% of performed sessions. Dropout rates (groups with vs without self-regulatory BCTs) were 29% vs 28%. The regression analysis revealed no effect of the self-regulatory BCTs on exercise adherence.  Conclusion:   An exercise adherence rate ≥50% for each FITT-principle and dropout rates at ~30% can be expected among patients taking part in long-term exercise interventions, combining resistance and endurance training during curative cancer treatment. Our results indicate that self-regulatory BCTs do not improve exercise adherence in interventions that provide evidence-based support to all participants (e.g., supervised group sessions).

RARP has now become a standard procedure for treating cases with localized prostate cancer. However, no study has examined its surgical time by accurately measuring the pelvic visceral fat (PVF) volume. This study aimed to investigate the factors associated with prolonged console time and surgical difficulty by RARP surgeons.  Methods:   This study included 405 patients who underwent RARP between 2014 and 2019 at our institution. Given that the anatomical characteristics were considered to affect RARP, PVF and working space (WS) were estimated preoperatively by computed tomography using a 3D image analysis system. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the factors prolonging console time, such as body mass index (BMI), prostate volume, previous abdominal surgery, nerve-sparing procedure, PVF, and WS. We also investigated whether post-operative complications were associated with any of these factors.  Results:   Larger PVF (p = 0.028, odds ratio (OR) 1.43), smaller WS (p < 0.001, OR 2.48), and the nerve-sparing procedure (p = 0.037, OR 1.61) were statistically significant factors associated with prolonged console time. Furthermore, higher BMI (p = 0.013, OR 1.49) and smaller pelvic width (p < 0.001, OR 2.63) were the alternative and more practical factors associated with prolonged console time. The post-operative anastomotic leakage occurrence rate increased with the number of risk factors, while post-operative complications did not change even in high-risk cases.  Conclusion:   PVF and WS are significant factors associated with prolonged console time in RARP cases. However, BMI can be as useful as PVF, since BMI significantly correlated with PVF. Additionally, pelvic width (PW) can be an alternative to WS, since PW correlated with WS. This study demonstrated that preoperative BMI and PW might predict the surgical risk and identify suitable RARP cases for novice surgeons.""","""['Takato Uchida', 'Taro Higure', 'Masayoshi Kawakami', 'Mayura Nakano', 'Nobuyuki Nakajima', 'Hakushi Kim', 'Masahiro Nitta', 'Masanori Hasegawa', 'Yoshiaki Kawamura', 'Sunao Shoji', 'Akira Miyajima']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Surg Endosc""","""['Comparing Revo-i and da Vinci in Retzius-Sparing Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: A Preliminary Propensity Score Analysis of Outcomes.', 'Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy Using the KangDuo Surgical Robot System vs the da Vinci Si Robotic System.', 'Effect of prostate and bony pelvic dimensions measured by preoperative magnetic resonance imaging on robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Comparison of perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes between standard laparoscopic and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systemic review and meta-analysis.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Weight loss for overweight and obese patients with prostate cancer: a study protocol of a randomised trial comparing clinic-based versus Telehealth delivered EXercise and nutrition intervention (the TelEX trial).']"""

Methods:   We profiled the serum levels of 14 ICK-related proteins (BTLA, GITR, HVEM, IDO, LAG-3, PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, Tim-3, CD28, CD80, 4-1BB, CD27, and CTLA-4) in 190 patients with localized PCa. The genotypes of 97 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 19 ICK-related genes were analyzed in an extended population (N = 1762). Meta-data from ArrayExpress and TCGA was employed to validate and to probe functional data. Patients were enrolled and tumor aggressiveness, biochemical recurrence (BCR), and progression information were obtained. Statistical analyses were performed analyzing associations between serum biomarkers, genotypes, mRNA and outcomes.  Results:   We showed that serum (s)BTLA and sTIM3 levels were associated with PCa aggressiveness (P < 0.05). sCD28, sCD80, sCTLA4, sGITR, sHVEM and sIDO correlated with both BCR and progression risks (all P < 0.05). We further identified ICK variants were significantly associated with aggressiveness, BCR and progression. Among them, 4 SNPs located in CD80 (rs7628626, rs12695388, rs491407, rs6804441) were not only associated with BCR and progression risk, but also correlated with sCD80 level (P < 0.01). rs491407 was further validated in an independent cohort. The CD80 mRNA expression was associated with BCR (HR, 1.85, 95% CI 1.06-3.22, P = 0.03) in meta-analysis of validation cohorts.

Methods:   CT-acquisition protocols were prospectively tested in a phantom. The multi-centric retrospective clinical study included CT scans of patients with colorectal/renal cancer liver metastases. Ninety-three radiomics features of first order and texture were extracted. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) between CT-acquisition protocols were evaluated to define sources of variability. Voxel size, ComBat, and singular value decomposition (SVD) compensation methods were explored for reducing the radiomics variability. The number of robust features was compared before and after correction using two-proportion z test. The radiomics classification accuracy (K-means purity) was assessed before and after ComBat- and SVD-based correction.  Results:   Fifty-three acquisition protocols in 13 tissue densities were analyzed. Ninety-seven liver metastases from 43 patients with CT from two vendors were included. Pixel size, reconstruction slice spacing, convolution kernel, and acquisition slice thickness are relevant sources of radiomics variability with a percentage of robust features lower than 80%. Resampling to isometric voxels increased the number of robust features when images were acquired with different pixel sizes (p < 0.05). SVD-based for thickness correction and ComBat correction for thickness and combined thickness-kernel increased the number of reproducible features (p < 0.05). ComBat showed the highest improvement of radiomics-based classification in both the phantom and clinical applications (K-means purity 65.98 vs 73.20).  Conclusion:   CT-image post-acquisition processing and radiomics normalization by means of batch effect correction allow for standardization of large-scale data analysis and improve the classification accuracy.

Here, we show that AR signalling in the macrophage-like THP-1 cell line supports PCa cell line migration and invasion in culture via increased Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) signalling and expression of its downstream cytokines. Moreover, AR signalling in THP-1 and monocyte-derived macrophages upregulates IL-10 and markers of tissue residency.

Functional assays, including EdU, wound healing, transwell, and immunofluorescence staining, revealed the effect of PCAT6 on cell proliferation, migration, and EMT process. The tube-formation assay disclosed the function of PCAT6 on angiogenesis. In vivo assays were also established to explore the impact of PCAT6 on tumor growth and microangiogenesis. The results revealed that PCAT6 boosted TNBC cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Then, this study unveiled that M2 macrophage secreted VEGF to stimulate the upregulation of PCAT6, thus promoting angiogenesis in TNBC. Next, through bioinformatics analysis and mechanism assays, we identified that PCAT6 positively regulated VEGFR2 expression via ceRNA pattern and then participated in VEGFR/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway to accelerate angiogenesis. Moreover, PCAT6 bound USP14, a deubiquitinase, to induce the deubiquitination of VEGFR2. On the whole, M2 macrophage-induced upregulation of PCAT6 facilitates TNBC tumorigenesis through modulation of VEGFR2 expression via ceRNA and deubiquitination patterns.""","""['Fang Dong#', 'Shengnan Ruan#', 'Jinlong Wang', 'Yun Xia', 'Kehao Le', 'Xiaoyun Xiao', 'Ting Hu', 'Qiong Wang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Correction: M2 macrophage-induced lncRNA PCAT6 facilitates tumorigenesis and angiogenesis of triple-negative breast cancer through modulation of VEGFR2.', 'Long noncoding RNA HOST2, working as a competitive endogenous RNA, promotes STAT3-mediated cell proliferation and migration via decoying of let-7b in triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Hedgehog signalling pathway orchestrates angiogenesis in triple-negative breast cancers.', 'Long non-coding RNA DGCR5 incudes tumorigenesis of triple-negative breast cancer by affecting Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.', 'A review on the role of PCAT6 lncRNA in tumorigenesis.', 'Long noncoding RNAs in triple-negative breast cancer: A new frontier in the regulation of tumorigenesis.', 'LncRNAs associated with oxidative stress in diabetic wound healing: Regulatory mechanisms and application prospects.', 'A signature of cuproptosis-related lncRNAs predicts prognosis and provides basis for future anti-tumor drug development in breast cancer.', 'H19 recruited N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) reader YTHDF1 to promote SCARB1 translation and facilitate angiogenesis in gastric cancer.', 'Drug target therapy and emerging clinical relevance of exosomes in meningeal tumors.', 'ACAT1-mediated METTL3 acetylation inhibits cell migration and invasion in triple negative breast cancer.']"""

These cohort-based approaches cannot directly identify individual pathogenic noncoding mutations from personal cancer genomes. Therefore, although most somatic mutations are localized in the noncoding cancer genome, their effects on driving tumorigenesis and progression have not been systematically explored and noncoding somatic alleles have not been leveraged in current clinical practice to guide personalized screening, diagnosis, and treatment. Here, we present a deep learning framework to capture pathogenic noncoding mutations in personal cancer genomes, which perturb gene regulation by altering chromatin architecture. We deployed the system specifically for localized prostate cancer by integrating large-scale prostate cancer genomes and the prostate-specific epigenome. We exhaustively evaluated somatic mutations in each patient's genome and agnostically identified thousands of somatic alleles altering the prostate epigenome. Functional genomic analyses subsequently demonstrated that affected genes displayed differential expression in prostate tumor samples, were vulnerable to expression alterations, and were convergent onto androgen receptor-mediated signaling pathways. Accumulation of pathogenic regulatory mutations in these affected genes was predictive of clinical observations, suggesting potential clinical utility of this approach. Overall, the deep learning framework has significantly expanded our view of somatic mutations in the vast noncoding genome, uncovered novel genes in localized prostate cancer, and will foster the development of personalized screening and therapeutic strategies for prostate cancer.

Objective:   We report the prespecified event-driven final analysis for OS.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 1207 patients with nmCRPC (diagnosed by conventional imaging) were randomised 2:1 to apalutamide (240mg/d) or placebo, plus on-going androgen deprivation therapy. After MFS was met and the study was unblinded, 76 (19%) patients still receiving placebo crossed over to apalutamide.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   OS and time to cytotoxic chemotherapy (TTChemo) were analysed by group-sequential testing with O'Brien-Fleming-type alpha spending function.  Results and limitations:   At median 52-mo follow-up, 428 deaths had occurred. The median treatment duration was 32.9 mo for apalutamide group and 11.5 mo for placebo group. Median OS was markedly longer with apalutamide versus placebo, reaching prespecified statistical significance (73.9 vs 59.9 mo, hazard ratio [HR]: 0.78 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.64-0.96]; p=0.016). Apalutamide also lengthened TTChemo versus placebo (HR: 0.63 [95% CI, 0.49-0.81]; p=0.0002). Discontinuation rates in apalutamide and placebo groups due to progressive disease were 43% and 74%, and due to adverse events 15% and 8.4%, respectively. Subsequent life-prolonging therapy was received by 371 (46%) patients in the apalutamide arm and by 338 (84%) patients in the placebo arm including 59 patients who received apalutamide after crossover. Safety was consistent with previous reports; when adverse events were adjusted for treatment exposure, rash had the greatest difference of incidence between the apalutamide and placebo groups.  Conclusions:   Extension of OS with apalutamide compared with placebo conferred impactful benefit in patients with nmCRPC. There was a 22% reduction in the hazard of death in the apalutamide group despite 19% crossover (placebo to apalutamide) and higher rates of subsequent therapy in the placebo group.

In the planned primary analysis of a phase 3 trial, the median metastasis-free survival was significantly longer with darolutamide (40.4 months) than with placebo (18.4 months). The data for the analysis of overall survival were immature at the time of the primary analysis.  Methods:   In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned 1509 men, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive darolutamide (955 patients) or placebo (554 patients) while they continued to receive androgen-deprivation therapy. After the results of the primary end-point analysis were found to be positive, unblinding of the treatment assignments occurred, and patients in the placebo group were permitted to cross over to receive open-label darolutamide treatment. At the time of this prespecified final analysis, which had been planned to be performed after approximately 240 deaths had occurred, overall survival and all other secondary end points were evaluated.  Results:   The median follow-up time was 29.0 months. At the time of unblinding of the data, all 170 patients who were still receiving placebo crossed over to receive darolutamide; 137 patients who had discontinued placebo before unblinding had occurred received at least one other life-prolonging therapy. Overall survival at 3 years was 83% (95% confidence interval [CI], 80 to 86) in the darolutamide group and 77% (95% CI, 72 to 81) in the placebo group. The risk of death was significantly lower, by 31%, in the darolutamide group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio for death, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.88; P = 0.003). Darolutamide was also associated with a significant benefit with respect to all other secondary end points, including the time to first symptomatic skeletal event and the time to first use of cytotoxic chemotherapy. The incidence of adverse events after the start of treatment was similar in the two groups; no new safety signals were observed.  Conclusions:   Among men with nonmetastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer, the percentage of patients who were alive at 3 years was significantly higher among those who received darolutamide than among those who received placebo.

Such monocytic cells have been implicated not only in tumour progression but also as a potential barrier for immunotherapy. This study examined the relationship between the frequency of circulating monocytic cells and epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) progression pre- and post-frontline chemotherapy, defined by disease stage, which is a leading prognostic factor for this malignancy.  Method of study:   Incident cases of 236 women with EOC were recruited and comprehensive flow cytometry was utilized to assess the frequency of peripheral blood CD33+ CD11b+ HLA-DR-/low CD14+ CD15- monocytic cells, henceforth termed CD14+ HLA-DRlo/- monocytic cells, prior to and after completion of frontline chemotherapy. Multivariable odds ratios (OR) were used to estimate the association between CD14+ HLA-DRlo/- monocytic cell percentages and disease stage. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests evaluated changes in these monocytic cell levels pre- and post-chemotherapy in a patient subset (n = 70).  Results:   Patients with elevated frequencies of circulating CD14+ HLA-DRlo/- monocytic cells at diagnosis were at 3.33-fold greater odds of having advanced stage (III/IV) EOC (CI: 1.04-10.64), with a significant trend in increasing CD14+ HLA-DRlo/- monocytic cell levels (P = .04).

Patients with hormone-dependent PCa are initially sensitive to androgen-deprivation therapy, later the cancer progress to a hormone-independent state and fails to respond and progress to the metastatic stage, where the cells gain the ability to escape cell death and develop resistance to current therapies, thereby leading to migration, invasion, and metastasis of cancer. Many clinical trials using nutraceuticals on cancer using human subjects have also been extensively studied, these studies confirm the efficacy of drugs tested in in vitro and in vivo preclinical models. Among various dietary phytochemicals, ginger is commonly used in the diet and possesses many active principles that act against cancer. Among various active principles, zingerone is a key active phenolic compound present in Zingiber officinale (Ginger), it has potent antioxidant property and it acts against carcinogens. The present study evaluated the efficacy of zingerone at different doses on the PCa cell line regarding apoptosis, upstream signing molecules such as Akt/mTOR, and migration metastasis. A cell viability assay using MTT was performed to estimate the percentage of viability of zingerone-treated PC-3 cells. The mitochondrial membrane potential, intracellular reactive oxygen species, and apoptosis induction in the zingerone-treated PC-3 cells were studied by using different fluorescence staining techniques. The expression patterns of PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, mTOR, and p-mTOR were investigated through the Western blot analysis assay.

In 2015, to encourage the sustainable use of palliative radiation oncology resources, CancerCare Manitoba disseminated, to each radiation oncologist in Manitoba, guidelines from Choosing Wisely Canada (cwc) that recommend sfrt. We assessed whether dissemination of the guidelines influenced sfrt use in Manitoba in 2016, and we identified factors associated with mfrt.  Methods:   All patients treated with palliative radiotherapy for bone metastasis in Manitoba from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016 were identified from the provincial radiotherapy database. Patient, treatment, and disease characteristics were extracted from the electronic medical record and tabulated by fractionation schedule. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors associated with mfrt.  Results:   In 2016, 807 patients (mean age: 70 years; range: 35-96 years) received palliative radiotherapy for bone metastasis, with 69% of the patients having uncomplicated bone metastasis. The most common primary malignancies were prostate (27.1%), lung (20.6%), and breast cancer (15.9%). In 62% of cases, mfrt was used-a proportion that was unchanged from 2015. On multivariable analysis, a gastrointestinal [odds ratio (or): 5.3] or lung primary (or: 3.3), complicated bone metastasis (or: 4.3), and treatment at a subsidiary site (or: 4.4) increased the odds of mfrt use.

Expression of circDDX17 in prostate cancer-afflicted tissue samples was determined by qRT-PCR. Functionally, circDDX17 induced remarkable inhibition of cell colonizing ability, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression in vitro. Mechanistically, dual-luciferase reporter assays, RNA immunoprecipitation, and RNA pull-down experiments helped verify interactions between circDDX17 and miR-346. Low expression of circDDX17 occurred in TCGA PCa samples. Furthermore, circDDX17 expression was downregulated significantly in PCa. These results suggested that circDDX17 suppressed PC cell mobility, proliferation, and invasion. Mechanistic experiments indicated that circDDX17 might serve as a ceRNA of miR-346 to relieve repressive effects of miR-346 upon phospholysine phosphohistidine inorganic pyrophosphate phosphatase (LHPP). LHPP expression itself was downregulated in TCGA PCa samples. Overall, our findings indicated that the circDDX17/miR-346/LHPP pathway inhibited the progression of prostate cancer and that circDDX17 may be a new potential therapeutic or diagnostic target for treating and diagnosing prostate cancer.

However, its expression and functional role in prostate cancer (PCa) are unclear. Herein, we explored the potential mechanism and tumor-inhibiting role of cir-ITCH in PCa. Using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay, we analyzed the expression of cir-ITCH in PCa and paired adjacent nontumor tissue samples resected during surgical operation, as well as in two cell lines of human PCa (LNCaP and PC-3) and the immortalized normal prostate epithelial cell line (RWPE-1). Cell viability and migration of PCa cell lines were evaluated using CCK-8 and wound-healing assays. Expression of key proteins of the Wnt/β-catenin and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways was detected using western blotting. We found that cir-ITCH expression was typically downregulated in the tissues and cell lines of PCa compared to that in the peritumoral tissue and in RWPE-1 cells, respectively. The results showed that cir-ITCH overexpression significantly inhibits the proliferation, migration, and invasion of human PCa cells and that reciprocal inhibition of expression occurred between cir-ITCH and miR-17. Proteins in the Wnt/β-catenin and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways were downregulated by overexpression of cir-ITCH both in androgen receptor-positive LNCaP cells and androgen receptor-negative PC-3 cells.

PI-RADS version 2.1 (v2.1) modifications primarily address transition zone (TZ) interpretation. The revisions also impact peripheral zone (PZ) interpretation, which has received less attention. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to compare interobserver agreement of PI-RADS version 2 (v2) and v2.1 in the prostate PZ and TZ and perform a pilot comparison of their diagnostic performance in the two zones. METHODS. Six radiologists with varying experience retrospectively assessed 80 prostate lesions (40 PZ, 40 TZ) on MRI in separate sessions for PI-RADS v2 and v2.1. Interobserver agreement was assessed using Conger kappa (κ). For 50 lesions with pathology data, average AUC for detecting clinically significant cancer was compared between versions using multireader multicase statistical methods. Error variance and covariance results informed post hoc power analysis. RESULTS. Interobserver agreement for PI-RADS category 4 or greater was higher for version 2.1 (κ = 0.64) than version 2 (κ = 0.51) in the PZ, but similar for version 2 (κ = 0.64) and version 2.1 (κ = 0.60) in the TZ. The PI-RADS v2.1 DWI descriptor ""linear/wedge-shaped"" had higher agreement than its predecessor version 2 descriptor ""indistinct hypointense"" (κ = 0.52 vs κ = 0.18) and yielded 14 more true-negative versus five more false-negative interpretations. The ADC signal descriptor ""markedly hypointense,"" for which only version 2.1 provides a specific definition, had lower agreement in version 2.1 (κ = 0.26) than version 2 (κ = 0.52). Modified TZ T2-weighted category 2 descriptors in version 2.1 had fair agreement (κ = 0.21), and agreement for PI-RADS category 2 in the TZ was lower in version 2.1 (κ = 0.31) than version 2 (κ = 0.57). DWI upgraded a TZ lesion category from 2 to 3 in four patients, detecting two additional cancers. Average AUC was not different between versions 2 and 2.1 for the PZ (AUC, 0.81 vs 0.85; p = .24) or the TZ (AUC, 0.69 vs 0.69; p = .94), though among experienced readers AUC was higher for version 2.1 than version 2 for the PZ (0.91 vs 0.82; p = .001). Overall performance comparison had sufficient power (0.8) to detect a 0.085 difference in AUC. CONCLUSION. Interobserver agreement improved using PI-RADS v2.1 in the PZ but not the TZ. Diagnostic performance improved using version 2.1 only in the PZ for experienced readers. Specific version 2.1 modifications yielded mixed results. CLINICAL IMPACT. The impact of PI-RADS v2.1 in the PZ is notable given the emphasis on version 2.1 TZ modifications. The findings suggest areas in which additional modification could further improve interobserver agreement and performance.""","""['Rajesh Bhayana', ""Aileen O'Shea"", 'Mark A Anderson', 'William R Bradley', 'Ravi V Gottumukkala', 'Amirkasra Mojtahed', 'Theodore T Pierce', 'Mukesh Harisinghani']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""AJR Am J Roentgenol""","""['Diagnostic Accuracy and Interobserver Agreement of PI-RADS Version 2 and Version 2.1 for the Detection of Transition Zone Prostate Cancers.', 'Proposed Adjustments to PI-RADS Version 2 Decision Rules: Impact on Prostate Cancer Detection.', 'Prevalence of Prostate Cancer in PI-RADS Version 2.1 Transition Zone Atypical Nodules Upgraded by Abnormal DWI: Correlation With MRI-Directed TRUS-Guided Targeted Biopsy.', 'Interobserver Agreement and Accuracy in Interpreting mpMRI of the Prostate: a Systematic Review.', 'PI-RADS: what is new and how to use it.', 'Prospective Evaluation of PI-RADS Version 2.1 for Prostate Cancer Detection and Investigation of Multiparametric MRI-derived Markers.', 'Characterization of high-grade prostate cancer at multiparametric MRI: assessment of PI-RADS version 2.1 and version 2 descriptors across 21 readers with varying experience (MULTI study).', 'Are Urologists Ready for Interpretation of Multiparametric MRI Findings?

Patients and methods:   From Jan. 2007 to Dec. 2016, 195 patients underwent RP, of which 89 patients were performed by LRP (Group A), 106 by TU-LESS RP (Group B). The peri-operative data were collected and analyzed. All data referring to patient demographics, surgery, pathology, and peri-operative outcomes were recorded. The cosmetic result was investigated by the Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire (PSAQ). Analysis of variance or Chi squared test were adopted to analyze the data.  Results:   195 procedures were completed successfully. The operation time (109.6 ± 31.9 vs. 151.5 ± 87.3, P = 0.025) and anastomosis time (10.1 ± 4.8 vs. 21.8 ± 9.9, P < 0.001) of Group B was significantly reduced compared with Group A. Estimated blood loss in Group B was significantly lower than that in Group A (95.9 ± 11.1 vs. 180.2 ± 99.7, P = 0.006). About perioperative complications, Group B was also less compared with Group A (1.9% vs. 7.9%, P = 0.047). As to the usage of postoperative analgesics, Group B apparently used less than that in Group A (6.6% vs. 62.9%, P < 0.001), which is consistent with the visual analogue scale (VAS) of the two groups (1.7 ± 1.3 vs. 7.8 ± 1.1, P < 0.001). Patients in Group B were significantly more satisfied with incision healing than in group A (74.9 ± 9.3 vs. 49.7 ± 5.8, P < 0.001). There was no significant difference both in BCR rate and time between Group B and Group A. In urination control, more patients in Group B did not have urinary incontinence 3 month after RP compared with Group A (81.1% vs. 67.4%, P = 0.028).  Conclusions:   LESS RP is proved to be feasible for the proper patients, but it is difficult to popularized due to inconvenient operation. While by means of TU-LESS, operating difficulty can be significantly decreased. TU-LESS RP will be wildly accepted by surgeons and patients because of cosmetic satisfaction and quicker recovery.""","""['Yunfei Wei#', 'Jingyuan Tang#', 'Lin Yuan', 'Jian Su', 'Yang Zhang', 'Zhonglei Deng', 'Chen Zhu', 'Luming Shen', 'Ninghong Wang', 'Guojiang Xu', 'Yong Yang', 'Qingyi Zhu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int Urol Nephrol""","""['Transumbilical laparoendoscopic single-site radical prostatectomy and cystectomy with the aid of a transurethral port: a feasibility study.', 'Reduced port surgery for prostate cancer is feasible: comparative study of 2-port laparoendoscopic and conventional 5-port laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Extraperitoneal transumbilical laparoendoscopic single-site radical prostatectomy using a homemade single-port device: 20 cases with midterm outcomes.', 'Single port radical prostatectomy: current status.', 'Early experience in laparoscopic radical prostatectomy using the laparoscopic device for umbilical access SILS Port.']"""

This study aimed to evaluate whether PI-RADS version 2.1 is superior in detecting transition zone prostate cancer in comparison with PI-RADS version 2.  Methods:   This was a diagnostic study of patients with prostate diseases who visited the Urology Department of The Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University and underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination between 03-01-2016 and 10-31-2018. The images originally analyzed using PI-RADS version 2 were retrospectively re-analyzed and scored in 2019 according to the updated PI-RADS version 2.1. The kappa and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used.  Results:   For Reader 1, compared with PI-RADS version 2, version 2.1 had higher sensitivity (85% vs. 79%, P = 0.03), lower specificity (65% vs. 83%, P < 0.001), and lower area under the curve (AUC) (0.749 vs. 0.809, P < 0.001). For Reader 2 (first attempt), compared with PI-RADS version 2, version 2.1 had lower specificity (67% vs. 91%, P < 0.001) and lower AUC (0.702 vs. 0.844, P < 0.001). For Reader 2 (second attempt), compared with PI-RADS version 2, version 2.1 had higher sensitivity (88% vs. 78%, P < 0.001) and lower specificity (77% vs. 91%, P < 0.001). The kappa between the two attempts for Reader 2 was 0.321.

Severe bothersome LUTS are a common indication for surgery. The diagnostic tests may include urodynamics (UDS) to confirm whether BOO or DU is the cause, potentially reducing the number of people receiving (inappropriate) surgery.  Objectives:   The primary objective was to determine whether a care pathway including UDS is no worse for symptom outcome than one in which it is omitted, at 18 months after randomisation. Rates of surgery was the key secondary outcome.  Design:   This was a pragmatic, multicentre, two-arm (unblinded) randomised controlled trial, incorporating a health economic analysis and qualitative research.  Setting:   Urology departments of 26 NHS hospitals in England.  Participants:   Men (aged ≥ 18 years) seeking further treatment, potentially including surgery, for bothersome LUTS. Exclusion criteria were as follows: unable to pass urine without a catheter, having a relevant neurological disease, currently undergoing treatment for prostate or bladder cancer, previously had prostate surgery, not medically fit for surgery and/or unwilling to be randomised.  Interventions:   Men were randomised to a care pathway based on non-invasive routine tests (control) or routine care plus invasive UDS (intervention arm).  Main outcome measures:   The primary outcome was International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) at 18 months after randomisation and the key secondary outcome was rates of surgery. Additional secondary outcomes included adverse events (AEs), quality of life, urinary and sexual symptoms, UDS satisfaction, maximum urinary flow rate and cost-effectiveness.  Results:   A total of 820 men were randomised (UDS, 427; routine care, 393). Sixty-seven men withdrew before 18 months and 11 died (unrelated to trial procedures). UDS was non-inferior to routine care for IPSS 18 months after randomisation, with a confidence interval (CI) within the margin of 1 point (-0.33, 95% CI -1.47 to 0.80). A lower surgery rate in the UDS arm was not found (38% and 36% for UDS and routine care, respectively), with overall rates lower than expected. AEs were similar between the arms at 43-44%. There were more cases of acute urinary retention in the routine care arm. Patient-reported outcomes for LUTS improved in both arms and satisfaction with UDS was high in men who received it. UDS was more expensive than routine care. From a secondary care perspective, UDS cost an additional £216 over an 18-month time horizon. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were similar, with a QALY difference of 0.006 in favour of UDS over 18 months. It was established that UDS was acceptable to patients, and valued by both patients and clinicians for its perceived additional insight into the cause and probable best treatment of LUTS.  Limitations:   The trial met its predefined recruitment target, but surgery rates were lower than anticipated.  Conclusions:   Inclusion of UDS in the diagnostic tests results in a symptom outcome that is non-inferior to a routine care pathway, but does not affect surgical rates for treating BOO. Results do not support the routine use of UDS in men undergoing investigation of LUTS.  Future work:   Focus should be placed on indications for selective utilisation of UDS in individual cases and long-term outcomes of diagnosis and therapy.

Thulium laser transurethral vaporesection of the prostate (ThuVARP) vaporises and resects the prostate using a technique similar to TURP. The small amount of existing literature suggests that there may be potential advantages of ThuVARP over TURP.  Objective:   To determine whether or not the outcomes from ThuVARP are equivalent to the outcomes from TURP in men with BPO treated in the NHS.  Design:   A multicentre, pragmatic, randomised controlled parallel-group trial, with an embedded qualitative study and economic evaluation.  Setting:   Seven UK centres - four university teaching hospitals and three district general hospitals.  Participants:   Men aged ≥ 18 years who were suitable to undergo TURP, presenting with bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) or urinary retention secondary to BPO.  Interventions:   Patients were randomised 1 : 1 to receive TURP or ThuVARP and remained blinded.  Main outcome measures:   Two co-primary outcomes - patient-reported International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and clinical measure of maximum urine flow rate (Qmax) at 12 months post surgery.  Results:   In total, 410 men were randomised, 205 to each arm. The two procedures were equivalent in terms of IPSS [adjusted mean difference 0.28 points higher for ThuVARP (favouring TURP), 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.92 to 1.49 points]. The two procedures were not equivalent in terms of Qmax (adjusted mean difference 3.12 ml/second in favour of TURP, 95% CI 0.45 to 5.79 ml/second), with TURP deemed superior. Surgical outcomes, such as complications and blood transfusion rates, and hospital stay were similar for both procedures. Patient-reported urinary and sexual symptoms were also similar between the arms. Qualitative interviews indicated similar patient experiences with both procedures. However, 25% of participants in the ThuVARP arm did not undergo their randomised allocation, compared with 2% of participants in the TURP arm. Prostate cancer was also detected less frequently from routine histology after ThuVARP (65% lower odds of detection) in an exploratory analysis. The adjusted mean differences between the arms were similar for secondary care NHS costs (£9 higher for ThuVARP, 95% CI -£359 to £376) and quality-adjusted life-years (0.01 favouring TURP, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.01).  Limitations:   Complications were recorded in prespecified categories; those not prespecified were excluded owing to variable reporting. Preoperative Qmax and IPSS data could not be collected for participants with indwelling catheters, making adjustment for baseline status difficult.  Conclusions:   TURP was superior to ThuVARP in terms of Qmax, although both operations resulted in a Qmax considered clinically successful. ThuVARP also potentially resulted in lower detection rates of prostate cancer as a result of the smaller volume of tissue available for histology. Length of hospital stay after ThuVARP, anticipated to be a key benefit, was equal to that after TURP in this trial. Overall, both ThuVARP and TURP were effective procedures for BPO, with minor benefits in favour of TURP. Therefore, the results suggest that it may be appropriate that new treatment alternatives continue to be compared with TURP.  Future work:   Longer-term follow-up to assess reoperation rates over time, and research into the comparative effectiveness of ThuVARP and TURP in large prostates.

Therefore, there is a need for markers indicating metastatic dissemination.  Methods:   EGFR overexpression (EGFRover) was tracked in 1039 primary tumours, circulating tumour cells from 39 d'Amico high-risk patients and metastatic samples from 21 castration-resistant PCa cases. EGFR status was compared to clinical parameters and multiple molecular factors were assessed using immunohistochemistry and gene ontology analysis. The functional aspect of EGFR was evaluated by plating PC-3 cells on soft and rigid matrices.  Results:   EGFRover was found in 14% of primary tumours, where it was associated with shorter metastasis-free survival and was an independent indicator of worse overall survival. EGFRover correlated with a pro-migratory and pro-metastatic phenotype of tumour cells as well as rich collagen fibre content. All circulating tumour cells (detected in 13% of cases) were positive for EGFR, independent of their EMT-related phenotype. EGFRover was more prevalent in castration-resistant bone metastases (29% of patients) and supported growth of human PCa cells on rigid matrices mimicking bone stiffness.

In gastric cancer, it had been reported to be downregulated. However, the clinical significance and underlying mechanism of PART1 function in gastric cancer remains undefined. Here, seven differential expression levels of noncoding RNAs (DE-lncRNAs) were screened from gastric cancer through a probe reannotation of a human exon array. PART1 was selected for further study because of its high fold change number. In our cohort, PART1 was identified as a significant downregulated lncRNA in gastric cancer tissues by qPCR and in situ hybridization (ISH), and its low expression was significantly correlated with postoperative metastasis and short overall survival time after surgery. Through the results of gain-of-function experiments, PART1 was confirmed as a tumor suppressor that can decrease not only cell viability, migration, and invasion in vitro but also tumorigenesis and tumor metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, RNA pull-down and RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) showed that PART1 interacts with androgen receptor (AR), and then, promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) is upregulated in an androgen-independent manner. In a chain reaction, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay additionally illustrated that PLZF upregulation increased the enrichment of EZH2 and H3K27 trimethylation in the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFB) promotor, thereby inhibition of PDGFB and the subsequent PDGFRβ/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Based on these findings, we showed PART1 plays a tumor suppressor role by promoting PLZF expression followed by recruitment of EZH2 to mediate epigenetic PDGFB silencing and downstream PI3K/Akt inhibition, suggesting that PART1 has a key role in restraining the aggressive ability of GC cells and providing a novel perspective on lncRNAs in GC progression.""","""['H Han', 'S Wang#', 'J Meng#', 'G Lyu#', 'G Ding#', 'Y Hu', 'L Wang', 'L Wu', 'W Yang', 'Y Lv', 'S Jia', 'L Zhang', 'J Ji']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Tumor suppressor PLZF regulated by lncRNA ANRIL suppresses proliferation and epithelial mesenchymal transformation of gastric cancer cells.', 'LncRNA AK023391 promotes tumorigenesis and invasion of gastric cancer through activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.', 'LncRNA MEG3 inhibits the progression of prostate cancer by facilitating H3K27 trimethylation of EN2 through binding to EZH2.', 'Gene methylation in gastric cancer.', 'Epigenetic regulation in human melanoma: past and future.', 'The roles of EZH2 in cancer and its inhibitors.', 'A review on the role of long non-coding RNA prostate androgen-regulated transcript 1 (PART1) in the etiology of different disorders.', 'Chromatin and noncoding RNA-mediated mechanisms of gastric tumorigenesis.', 'ERp44 Regulates the Proliferation, Migration, Invasion, and Apoptosis of Gastric Cancer Cells Via Activation of ER Stress.', 'Long non‑coding RNA PART1: dual role in cancer.']"""

The aim of the study is to evaluate anxiety levels in men on AS and how anxiety relates to disease characteristics and treatment decision-making.  Methods:   A retrospective analysis was conducted using all 302 subjects from the Reduction by Dutasteride of clinical progression Events in Expectant Management (REDEEM) study. Prostate biopsies were obtained at 18 and 36 months. Anxiety was measured at baseline and 3, 6, 12, 18, and 36 months post-randomization using the MAX-PC (Memorial general anxiety scale for PCa) questionnaire. Univariable and multivariable analysis of the association of disease aggressiveness (PSA levels, percentage of positive cores, and maximum core involvement) and anxiety levels were performed. Cox regression was used to analyze time to progression to discontinuation of active surveillance as a function of baseline anxiety.  Results:   Overall, MAX-PC scores decreased from moderate at baseline with slight increases after receiving PSA results at 18 months, followed by more decline. Percentage of positive cores was associated with baseline anxiety (P = 0.02). The association remained when controlling for age, race, number of cores sampled, body mass index, prostate volume, and maximum core length (P = 0.003). In univariable and multivariable analysis, baseline anxiety was not significantly associated with time to progression to discontinuation of active surveillance.  Conclusions:   In evaluating the natural history of anxiety levels among patients with prostate cancer undergoing active surveillance, there was a decline of anxiety levels over time, with increases after receiving PSA results. Moreover, we found that disease aggressiveness measured by percentage of positive biopsy cores was associated with baseline levels of anxiety.

Methods:   Consecutive patients undergoing either ORP or RARP between April 2009 and June 2017 were included in this study. Pericatheter urethrography (PCU) was performed the day of catheter removal to confirm healing of the vesicourethral anastomosis and to measure PCU-MUL. Daily usage of incontinence pad was self-reported by the patient at each post-operative visit through a questionnaire. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors that influenced recovery of continence.  Results:   Of the 196 patients included, 121 and 75 patients received ORP and RARP, respectively. The cumulative full continence rates (0 pad/day) at 1 year in the ORP and RARP groups were 87% and 95%, respectively. In the univariate analysis, older age, high preoperative International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) irritative symptom domain, ORP, poorer NVB preservation, and shorter PCU-MUL were associated with delayed recovery of full continence. In the multivariate analysis, only older age, high preoperative IPSS irritative symptom domain, and shorter PCU-MUL remained as independent factors significantly associated with delayed recovery of full continence.  Conclusions:   Our study highlights the importance of saving the MUL as long as possible in terms of continence recovery.

We evaluated the value of Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT with MRI in treatment-naive PCa.This retrospective study was approved by the hospital ethics committee. The MRI and Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging data of 63 cases of highly suspected PCa were enrolled in this study. The SUVmax and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and their ratio, were assessed as diagnostic markers to distinguish PCa from benign disease.There were 107 prostate lesions detected in 63 cases. Forty cases with 64 malignant primary lesions were confirmed PCa, whereas 23 cases had 43 benign lesions. PSMA-avid lesions correlated with hypointense signal on ADC maps and hyperintense signal on diffusion-weighted imaging. The ADC of PCa was lower than that of benign lesions, and SUVmax and SUVmax/ADC of PCa was higher than that of benign lesions (P < .01). ADC had significant negative correlation with Gleason score (GS) and SUVmax, SUVmax, and SUVmax/ADC positively correlated with GS.

Materials and methods:   A total of 100 consecutive men underwent hemigland high intensity focused ultrasound (December 2015 to December 2019). Primary end point was treatment failure, defined as Grade Group 2 or greater on followup prostate biopsy, radical treatment, systemic therapy, metastases or prostate cancer specific mortality. IIEF (International Index of Erectile Function), I-PSS (International Prostate Symptom Score) and 90-day complications were reported.  Results:   At study entry patients had very low (8%), low (20%), intermediate favorable (50%), intermediate unfavorable (17%) and high (5%) risk prostate cancer. Median followup was 20 months. The 2-year survival free from treatment failure, Grade Group 2 or greater recurrence, repeat focal high intensity focused ultrasound and radical treatment was 73%, 76%, 90% and 91%, respectively. Bilateral prostate cancer at diagnosis was the sole predictor for Grade Group 2 or greater recurrence (p=0.03). Of men who underwent posttreatment biopsy (58), 10 had in-field and 8 out-of-field Grade Group 2 or greater positive biopsy. Continence (zero pad) was maintained in 100% of patients. Median IIEF-5 and I-PSS scores before vs after hemigland high intensity focused ultrasound were 22 vs 21 (p=0.99) and 9 vs 6 (p=0.005), respectively. Minor and major complications occurred in 13% and 0% of patients. No patient had rectal fistula or died.  Conclusions:   Short-term results of focal high intensity focused ultrasound indicate safety, excellent potency and continence preservation, and adequate short-term prostate cancer control. Radical treatment was avoided in 91% of men at 2 years. Men with bilateral prostate cancer at diagnosis have increased risk for Grade Group 2 or greater recurrence.

However, these tests require improvement to meet the clinical need for resolving overtreatment, which continues to be a pervasive problem in PCa management. Genomic selection (GS) methodology, which utilizes whole-genome markers to predict agronomic traits, was adopted in this study for PCa prognosis. We leveraged The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to evaluate the prediction performance of six GS methods and seven omics data combinations, which showed that the Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) model outperformed the other methods regarding predictability and computational efficiency. Leveraging the BLUP-HAT method, an accelerated version of BLUP, we demonstrated that using expression data of a large number of disease-relevant genes and with an integration of other omics data (i.e. miRNAs) significantly increased outcome predictability when compared with panels consisting of a small number of genes. Finally, we developed a novel stepwise forward selection BLUP-HAT method to facilitate searching multiomics data for predictor variables with prognostic potential. The new method was applied to the TCGA data to derive mRNA and miRNA expression signatures for predicting relapse-free survival of PCa, which were validated in six independent cohorts. This is a transdisciplinary adoption of the highly efficient BLUP-HAT method and its derived algorithms to analyze multiomics data for PCa prognosis. The results demonstrated the efficacy and robustness of the new methodology in developing prognostic models in PCa, suggesting a potential utility in managing other types of cancer.""","""['Ruidong Li', 'Shibo Wang', 'Yanru Cui', 'Han Qu', 'John M Chater', 'Le Zhang', 'Julong Wei', 'Meiyue Wang', 'Yang Xu', 'Lei Yu', 'Jianming Lu', 'Yuanfa Feng', 'Rui Zhou', 'Yuhan Huang', 'Renyuan Ma', 'Jianguo Zhu', 'Weide Zhong', 'Zhenyu Jia']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Brief Bioinform""","""['Stromal Gene Expression is Predictive for Metastatic Primary Prostate Cancer.', 'A new thinking: extended application of genomic selection to screen multiomics data for development of novel hypoxia-immune biomarkers and target therapy of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'Clinical significance of miRNA host gene promoter methylation in prostate cancer.', 'The Potential of MicroRNAs as Prostate Cancer Biomarkers.', 'MiRNAs and radical prostatectomy: Current data, bioinformatic analysis and utility as predictors of tumour relapse.', 'Identification and verification of an ALYREF-involved 5-methylcytosine based signature for stratification of prostate cancer patients and prediction of clinical outcome and response to therapies.', 'A five-pseudouridylation-associated-LncRNA classifier for primary prostate cancer prognosis prediction.', 'Therapeutic and prognostic potential of GPCRs in prostate cancer from multi-omics landscape.', 'A penalized linear mixed model with generalized method of moments for prediction analysis on high-dimensional multi-omics data.', 'Integrated Analysis of MATH-Based Subtypes Reveals a Novel Screening Strategy for Early-Stage Lung Adenocarcinoma.']"""

Quantitative total bone imaging (QTBI) using 18F-NaF positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scans is a tool that allows characterization of interlesional treatment response heterogeneity in bone. Understanding spatial-temporal response is important to identify individuals who may benefit from treatment beyond progression.  Patients and methods:   Men with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with at least two lesions on bone scintigraphy were enrolled and treated with enzalutamide 160 mg daily (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02384382). 18F-NaF PET/CT scans were obtained at baseline (PET1), week 13 (PET2), and at the time of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression, standard radiographic or clinical progression, or at 2 years without progression (PET3). QTBI was used to determine lesion-level response. The primary end point was the proportion of men with at least one responding bone lesion on PET3 using QTBI.  Results:   Twenty-three men were enrolled. Duration on treatment ranged from 1.4 to 34.1 months. In general, global standardized uptake value (SUV) metrics decreased while on enzalutamide (PET2) and increased at the time of progression (PET3). The most robust predictor of PSA progression was change in SUVhetero (PET1 to PET3; hazard ratio, 3.88; 95% CI, 1.24 to 12.1). Although overall functional disease burden improved during enzalutamide treatment, an increase in total burden (SUVtotal) was seen at the time of progression, as measured by 18F-NaF PET/CT. All (22/22) evaluable men had at least one responding bone lesion at PET3 using QTBI.  Conclusion:   We found that the proportion of progressing lesions was low, indicating that a substantial number of lesions appear to continue to benefit from enzalutamide beyond progression.

Materials and methods:   A hybridization capture based next-generation sequencing assay was used to identify germline and somatic alterations in 50 genes including androgen receptor pathway genes, DNA damage repair pathway genes, TP53 and RB1.  Results:   We successfully sequenced DNA from 396 blood samples and 32 matched tumor tissue samples from 396 patients. We observed a similar frequency of deleterious germline alterations between patients with castration sensitive prostate cancer and metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (8.9% vs 9.8%, p >0.05). There was a high consistency (90.9%) between metastatic tumor tissue and matched circulating tumor DNA. Among patients who were circulating tumor DNA positive we observed significantly higher alteration frequencies of CDK12 (27.2% vs 6.4%, p <0.001) and FOXA1 (36.8% vs 15.3%, p <0.001) in our metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer cohort compared with the SU2C-PCF (Stand Up to Cancer-Prostate Cancer Foundation) cohort. Alteration frequencies of DNA damage repair pathway genes (66.7% vs 41.5%, p=0.015) and androgen receptor pathway genes (71.9% vs 48.8%, p=0.018) in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer were higher than in patients with de novo metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer. Androgen receptor alteration was selectively enriched in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Through genomic profiling of prostate cancer across clinical states we identified a similar frequency of deleterious germline alterations between patients with castration sensitive prostate cancer and metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. We explored the genomic diversity of androgen receptor and DNA damage repair pathway genes between patients with metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer and metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.

Of those with prostate cancer 102 (5.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 304 (17.1%) were on androgen deprivation therapy. Among those on androgen deprivation therapy 5.6% were positive as compared to 5.8% not on androgen deprivation therapy. Men on androgen deprivation therapy were slightly older (75.5 vs 73.8 years, p=0.009), more likely to have smoked (68.1% vs 59.3%, p=0.005) and more likely to report taking steroids (43.8% vs 23.3%, p <0.001). Other factors known to increase risk of infection and disease severity were equally distributed (asthma, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure and immune suppressive disease). Multivariable analysis did not indicate a difference in infection risk for those with prostate cancer on androgen deprivation therapy (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.54-1.61, p=0.8).  Conclusions:   Androgen deprivation therapy does not appear to be protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection.""","""['Eric A Klein', 'Jianbo Li', 'Alex Milinovich', 'Jesse D Schold', 'Nima Sharifi', 'Michael W Kattan', 'Lara Jehi']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Men with Prostate Cancer Does Not Affect Risk of Infection With SARS-CoV-2.

Notwithstanding, a critical challenge still remains in the exploration of an effective strategy to maximize the synergistic efficacy of PTT and PDT due to low photoconversion efficiency. Herein, inspired by the phospholipid bimolecular structure of the cell membrane, bionic cell membrane polymeric vesicles with photothermal/photodynamic synergy for prostate cancer therapy at one wavelength's excitation are constructed in one step by the coordination of hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) from the surface of hydrophobic gold nanorods (AuNRs) with indocyanine green (ICG) and polycaprolactone (PCL), achieving their self-assembly in aqueous solutions. Importantly, the aggregation of the assembly improves the stability of the vesicles, realizing the synergistic effect of PTT and PDT for prostate cancer therapy. After being assembled within polymeric vesicles, bifunctional photosensitizer ICG can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and photothermal effect under light treatment. Their ROS not only induce PDT efficacy but also destroy the integrity of the lysosomal membrane, promoting the translocation of ICG and another photosensitizer called gold nanorods (AuNRs) into the cytosol. Moreover, their photothermal effects produced by both photosensitizers are able to engender greater damage to the tumor cells because of the close distance with organelles. This structure manifests good cellular uptake, highly effective tumor accumulation, high photothermal conversion efficiency, and excellent properties of enhanced photobleaching resistance, which are beneficial to ICG-based fluorescence tumor imaging. Using the same near-infrared (NIR) wavelength for excitation, the AuNR/ICG vesicles can reduce the side effect rate of photodamage on the skin. In addition, by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and double photothermal effect, the vesicles under NIR excitation can promote the apoptosis of PC3 tumor cells. Taken together, the spontaneous self-assembled AuNR/ICG vesicles exhibit huge potential in advanced-stage prostate cancer therapy, especially for the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-negative castration-resistant subtype.""","""['Jiajia Hu', 'Huanhuan Luo', 'Qian Qu', 'Xiaofeng Liao', 'Chenglong Huang', 'Jiayi Chen', 'Zhenhai Cai', 'Yi Bao', 'Gang Chen', 'Biao Li', 'Wenguo Cui']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""ACS Appl Mater Interfaces""","""['Low Power Single Laser Activated Synergistic Cancer Phototherapy Using Photosensitizer Functionalized Dual Plasmonic Photothermal Nanoagents.', 'Calcium-carbonate packaging magnetic polydopamine nanoparticles loaded with indocyanine green for near-infrared induced photothermal/photodynamic therapy.', 'A near infrared-modulated thermosensitive hydrogel for stabilization of indocyanine green and combinatorial anticancer phototherapy.', 'Polymeric photothermal agents for cancer therapy: recent progress and clinical potential.', 'Progress of Phototherapy Applications in the Treatment of Bone Cancer.', 'Combinatorial Polydopamine-Liposome Nanoformulation as an Effective Anti-Breast Cancer Therapy.', 'Nanoparticles-based phototherapy systems for cancer treatment: Current status and clinical potential.', 'Photodynamic therapy for prostate cancer: Recent advances, challenges and opportunities.', 'Breast Cancer Cell Membrane Camouflaged Lipid Nanoparticles for Tumor-Targeted NIR-II Phototheranostics.', 'B16 Membrane-Coated Vesicles for Combined Photodynamic Therapy and Immunotherapy Shift Immune Microenvironment of Melanoma.']"""

While these complications are commonly treated by palliative transurethral resection of the prostate, the improvement is often insufficient. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of MRI-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation as an alternative palliative treatment option (pTULSA) for men suffering from symptomatic locally advanced prostate cancer.  Methods:   This prospective, phase one study included 10 men in need of palliative surgical intervention due to urinary retention and gross hematuria caused by locally advanced prostate cancer. Patients were followed for 1 year at 3-month intervals. Time without catheter, time without hematuria, reduction in hospitalization time, and adverse events were measured.  Results:   Ten patients with locally advanced prostate cancer were enrolled, all having continuous catheterization due to urinary retention and nine had gross hematuria before treatment. At 1 week post-pTULSA five patients were catheter-free. At last follow-up catheter-free and gross hematuria-free rates were 70% and 100%, respectively. Average hospitalization time from local complications reduced from 7.3 to 1.4 days in the 6 months before and after pTULSA. No > Grade 2 treatment related adverse events were reported, with all five being urinary tract infections.  Conclusions:   pTULSA appears safe and feasible for palliative ablation of locally advanced prostate cancer.

Numerous studies have shown CAV1 can be secreted within exosome-like vesicles, but antibody-mediated neutralization can mitigate PCa progression; this is suggestive of an inverted (non-exosomal) CAV1 topology. Here we show that CAV1 can be secreted from specific PCa types in an inverted vesicle-associated form consistent with the features of bioactive CAV1 secretion. Characterization of the isolated vesicles by electron microscopy, single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and proteomics reveals they represent a novel class of exosomes ~40 nm in diameter containing ~50-60 copies of CAV1 and, strikingly, are released via a non-canonical secretory macroautophagy/autophagy pathway. This study provides novel insights into a mechanism whereby CAV1 translocates from a normal plasma membrane distribution to an inverted secreted form implicated in PCa disease progression.Abbreviations: 3-MA: 3-methyladenine; APEX: a modified soybean ascorbate peroxidase; ATG5: autophagy related 5; ATG9A: autophagy related 9A; ATG12: autophagy related 12; BHK: baby hamster kidney; C-exosomes: caveolin-exosomes; CAMKK2/CAMKKβ: calckum/calmodulin dependent protein kinase kinase 2; CAV1: caveolin 1; DAB: 3,3'-diaminobenzidine; DAPK: death associated protein kinase; EEA1: early endosome antigen 1; EM: electron microscopy; FCS: fluorescence correlation spectroscopy; GBP: GFP/YFP-binding peptide; GFP: green fluorescent protein; GOLGA2: golgin A2; ILVs: intralumenal vesicles; LC3: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; MBP: maltose binding protein; MTORC1: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase complex 1; MVBs: multivesicular bodies; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PCa: prostate cancer; PI3K: phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PM: plasma membrane; SFM: serum-free medium; TSG101: tumor susceptibility 101; WCL: whole cell lysates; WT: wild type; YFP: yellow fluorescent protein; βoG: β-octylglucoside.""","""['Nicholas Ariotti', 'Yeping Wu', 'Satomi Okano', 'Yann Gambin', 'Jordan Follett', 'James Rae', 'Charles Ferguson', 'Rohan D Teasdale', 'Kirill Alexandrov', 'Frederic A Meunier', 'Michelle M Hill', 'Robert G Parton']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Autophagy""","""['PRNP/prion protein regulates the secretion of exosomes modulating CAV1/caveolin-1-suppressed autophagy.', 'Critical role of CAV1/caveolin-1 in cell stress responses in human breast cancer cells via modulation of lysosomal function and autophagy.', 'CAV1-CAVIN1-LC3B-mediated autophagy regulates high glucose-stimulated LDL transcytosis.', 'Autophagy in the physiological endometrium and cancer.', 'Caveolin-1 function at the plasma membrane and in intracellular compartments in cancer.', 'Sequential Treatment with Temozolomide Plus Naturally Derived AT101 as an Alternative Therapeutic Strategy: Insights into Chemoresistance Mechanisms of Surviving Glioblastoma Cells.', 'Role of Ceramides and Lysosomes in Extracellular Vesicle Biogenesis, Cargo Sorting and Release.', 'Hydrogen Peroxide Promotes the Production of Radiation-Derived EVs Containing Mitochondrial Proteins.', 'Fluid shear stress induces cell migration via RhoA-YAP1-autophagy pathway in liver cancer stem cells.', 'βIII-Tubulin Structural Domains Regulate Mitochondrial Network Architecture in an Isotype-Specific Manner.']"""

For example, the ERRα inverse agonist XCT790 modulates metabolic pathways in PCa cells, but it also functions as a mitochondrial uncoupler independent of targeting ERRα. Here, we describe a novel dual ERRα/γ inverse agonist, SLU-PP-1072, derived from the GSK4716 ERRγ agonist scaffold that is distinct from the XCT790 scaffold. SLU-PP-1072 alters PCa cell metabolism and gene expression, resulting in cell cycle dysregulation and increased apoptosis without acute mitochondrial uncoupling activity.

Materials and methods:   A prospective analysis of 251 primary prostate biopsies performed in Republican Specialized Scientific and Practical Medical Center of Urology to patients with LUTS during the period from 2018 to 2019 was carried out. All patients were divided into two groups. The group 1 included 189 patients who underwent standard systematic prostate biopsy; the group 2 consisted of 62 patients, who had had baseline multiparametric magnetic resonance tomography (mp-MRI) of the prostate with risk evaluation using PI-RADS v2 score, followed by systematic biopsy in combination with targeted biopsy. The ultrasound-guided biopsy was done under local anesthesia using lidocaine gel and periprostatic nerve block with a 2% lidocaine solution.

As mediators of tumor progression, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) can degrade extracellular matrix components and regulate growth factor and cytokine bioactivity. Depending on tissue context, MMPs can either promote or inhibit tumorigenesis. Therefore, it is essential to study individual MMPs in specific cancer contexts and microenvironments to support the design and application of selective MMP inhibitors. Here we report that tumor-derived MMP-3 contributes to bone metastatic prostate cancer progression via intrinsic and extrinsic routes. MMP-3 ablation in prostate cancer cell lines significantly reduced in vitro growth combined with lowered AKT and ERK phosphorylation and total VEGFR1 and FGFR3 protein levels. In vivo, MMP-3 ablated tumors grew at a slower rate and were significantly less vascularized. Quantitative PCR analyses of wild type and MMP-3 silenced prostate cancer cells also demonstrate downregulation of a wide array of angiogenic factors. The extrinsic role for MMP-3 in angiogenesis was supported by in vitro endothelial tube formation assays where the lack of MMP-3 in prostate cancer conditioned media resulted in slower rates of tube formation. Taken together, our results suggest that tumor-derived MMP-3 contributes to prostate cancer growth in bone.

We developed an RNA-based gene signature that detects underlying TP53 gene mutations and identifies wild-type prostate tumors that are analogous to TP53-mutant tumors.  Materials and methods:   Using genomic expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we developed a mutation signature score to predict prostatic tumors with a molecular fingerprint similar to tumors with TP53 mutations. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve assessed model accuracy in predicting TP53 mutations, and Cox regression models measured association between the signature and progression-free survival and metastasis-free survival (MFS).  Results:   The TP53 signature score achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.84 in the training and 0.82 in the validation cohorts for predicting an underlying mutation. In three retrospective cohorts, a high score was prognostic for poor 5-year MFS: 46% versus 81% (hazard ratio [HR], 3.05; P < .0001; Johns Hopkins University cohort), 64% versus 83% (HR, 2.77; P < .0001; Mayo Clinic cohort), and 71% versus 97% (HR, 6.8; P = .0001; Brigham and Women's Hospital cohort). The signature also identified TP53 wild-type tumors molecularly analogous to TP53 mutant tumors, wherein high signature score correlated with worse 5-year MFS (50% vs. 82%; HR, 3.05; P < .0001).  Conclusions:   This novel mutational signature predicted tumors with TP53 mutations, identified TP53 wild-type tumors analogous to mutant tumors, and was independently associated with poor MFS. This signature can therefore be used to strengthen existing clinical risk-stratification tools.""","""['Fallon E Chipidza', 'Mohammed Alshalalfa', 'Brandon A Mahal', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Yang Liu', 'Elai Davicioni', 'Neil E Martin', 'Kent W Mouw', 'Felix Y Feng', 'Paul L Nguyen', 'Vinayak Muralidhar']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Significance of TP53 Mutational Status-Associated Signature in the Progression and Prognosis of Endometrial Carcinoma.', 'A novel tp53-associated nomogram to predict the overall survival in patients with pancreatic cancer.', 'Genomically annotated risk model for advanced renal-cell carcinoma: a retrospective cohort study.', 'Mutations in TP53 or DNA damage repair genes define poor prognostic subgroups in primary prostate cancer.', 'Patient-Level DNA Damage and Repair Pathway Profiles and Prognosis After Prostatectomy for High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Recent Research Advances in Double-Strand Break and Mismatch Repair Defects in Prostate Cancer and Potential Clinical Applications.', 'Clinical testing of transcriptome-wide expression profiles in high-risk localized and metastatic prostate cancer starting androgen deprivation therapy: an ancillary study of the STAMPEDE abiraterone Phase 3 trial.', 'Plasma cell subtypes analyzed using artificial intelligence algorithm for predicting biochemical recurrence, immune escape potential, and immunotherapy response of prostate cancer.', 'The established chemokine-related prognostic gene signature in prostate cancer: Implications for anti-androgen and immunotherapies.', 'Genomic biomarkers to guide precision radiotherapy in prostate cancer.']"""

Few studies have examined the disparity between Whites and Hispanics or between Whites and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs).  Methods:   Using data from the National Cancer Database for 526,690 patients with prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy between 2004 and 2014, this study systematically evaluated the impact of clinical characteristics and factors related to access to care on survival by race. Included in the analysis were 432,640 White patients (82.1%), 63,602 Black patients (12.1%), 8990 AAPI patients (1.7%), and 21,458 Hispanic patients (4.1%). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals to measure racial survival disparities. Inverse probability weighting was used to adjust for imbalances of prognostic factors.  Results:   When adjustments were made for age and year of diagnosis only, Blacks had 51% higher mortality, AAPIs had 22% lower mortality, and Hispanics had 6% lower mortality than Whites. Overall, with adjustments for all clinical factors and nonclinical factors, the Black-White survival disparity narrowed to 20%, whereas the AAPI-White disparity increased to 35%. Among the controlled-for factors, education, median household income, and insurance status contributed the most to the racial disparity.

Although amino acids and lipids as biomarkers of prostate cancer have been examined using prostate cancer cell lines/tissues, no previous studies have evaluated amino acids or lipids as potential chronic prostatitis biomarkers.  Objectives:   The study's aim was to identify amino acids and lipids that could serve as potential biomarkers of chronic prostatitis.  Methods:   We profiled the amino acids and lipids found in plasma from rats collected in a previous study. In brief, a total of 148 Sprague-Dawley rats (offspring) were dosed with estradiol benzoate (EB) on postnatal days (PNDs) 1, 3 and 5, and subsequently dosed with testosterone (T)/estradiol (E) tubes via subcutaneous implants from PND 90 to 200. Plasma was collected on PNDs 30, 90, 100, 145 and 200. Analysis was conducted with a Xevo TQ-S triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer using a Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ p180 kit.  Results:   Plasma acylcarnitines [(C2, C16:1, C18, C18:1, C18:1-OH, and C18:2)], glycerophospholipids (lysophosphatidylcholine-acyl, -di-acyl, and -di-acyl acyl-alkyl) and sphingomyelins [SM (OH) C16:1, SM C18:0, SM C18:1, and SM C20:2] significantly increased on PND 145, when chronic inflammation was observed in the dorsolateral prostate of rats dosed with EB, T, and E. No statistical significances of amino acid levels were observed in the EB + T + E group on PND 145.  Conclusion:   Exposure to EB, T, and E altered lipid levels in rat plasma with chronic prostate inflammation.

This is due to its ability to recapitulate with ~100% penetrance multiple aspects of the human disease such as prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia lesions, invasive carcinoma, progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer including aggressive neuroendocrine prostate cancer and metastasis. Despite its popularity, the use of TRAMP mice is limited/slowed by the inability to distinguish the zygosity of the TRAMP transgene. This is especially true for breeding strategies implementing multiple crosses and alleles and when the rapid generation of large animal cohorts with the desired genotype is needed.  Methods:   We developed a quantitative PCR (qPCR) approach to determine the relative TRAMP transgene copy number of mice.  Results:   This method was validated by three independent laboratories across two institutions, which successfully identified the genotype of the mice 98.2% of the time (165/168) in the first attempt. The genotypes of the uncertain mice were correctly identified in the repeated experiments.  Conclusions:   We develop the first straightforward, qPCR approach to reliably determine the TRAMP transgene zygosity. The development of this qPCR-based genotyping method enables researchers to streamline breeding strategies when creating complex genetic mouse models involving TRAMP mice; thus, ultimately reducing the required animal numbers, cost, and investigator time.""","""['Ruidong Chen#', 'Xin Liang#', 'Mollianne M Murray', 'Ellen Karasik', 'Jenny J Han', 'Ming Zhu', 'Barbara A Foster', 'Daniel E Frigo', 'Guocan Wang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Extra-prostatic transgene-associated neoplastic lesions in transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice.', 'Dissociation of epithelial and neuroendocrine carcinoma lineages in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate model of prostate cancer.', 'Germline genetic variation modulates tumor progression and metastasis in a mouse model of neuroendocrine prostate carcinoma.', 'Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) model: A good alternative to study PCa progression and chemoprevention approaches.', 'Survey of genetically engineered mouse models for prostate cancer: analyzing the molecular basis of prostate cancer development, progression, and metastasis.']"""

We selected 15 patients with prostate cancer and visible DIL and compared 3 plans for each patient: 1) No boost plan of 35 Gy to prostate, 2) DIL_40 plan of SIB 40 Gy to DIL and 35 Gy to prostate, and 3) DIL_45 plan with 45 Gy to DIL and 35 Gy to the prostate in 5 fractions. All targets satisfied with the prescription coverage per protocol. However, some patients failed to meet the Dmax of the rectum in DIL_40 plans (n = 4), and DIL_45 plans (n = 6). Violations of bladder constraints occurred in four DIL_45 plans. Consequently, the DIL boost with SBRT was possible in 73% of patients with DIL_40 plans, and 60% of patients with DIL_45 plans without any violation of normal organ constraints. All patients who experienced constraint violations had DILs in posterior segments. DIL boost using CK-SBRT could be an option for localized prostate cancer patients.

Emerging evidence suggests that mpMRI-visible tumors are enriched with molecular features associated with increased disease aggressivity and poor clinical prognosis, which is supported by short-term endpoints, such as biochemical recurrence following surgery. Furthermore, at the histopathological level, mpMRI-visible tumors appear to exhibit increased architectural and vascular density compared to mpMRI-invisible disease. It seems probable that the genomic, pathological, radiological, and clinical features of mpMRI-visible and mpMRI-invisible prostate cancers are interrelated.

It has been speculated, that the advantage from early SRT is mainly caused by lead-time bias: Calculating from time of SRT, earlier treatment would per-se result in longer time to event/censoring compared with later treatment, but not extend the interval from RP to post-SRT failure.  Methods:   In 603 consecutive PCa patients receiving SRT between 1997 and 2017, we compared outcomes, calculating from time of irradiation vs. time of surgery.  Results:   In multivariable analysis, tumor stage pT3-4, pathological Gleason score GS ≤6 vs. GS 7 vs. GS ≥8, post-RP PSA persistence (nadir ≥0.1 ng/ml), and the pre-SRT PSA (continuous or with cutoff 0.4 ng/ml) were significant risk-factors for biochemical progression (BCR) and progression-free survival (PFS) post-SRT and post-RP. A pre-SRT PSA <0.4 ng/ml was a significant discriminator for Kaplan-Meier rates of BCR and PFS. The Cox model for overall survival (OS) included age at RP (continuous), pT2 vs. pT3-4, and pre-SRT PSA (continuous) as significant predictors. However, no significant cutoff for the pre-SRT PSA could be identified to differentiate Kaplan-Meier estimates of OS, possibly because there were too few events, as 88% of the patients were still alive at last follow-up.  Conclusions:   The pre-SRT PSA has a significant impact on BCR, PFS and potentially on OS, calculating either from RP or from SRT to event/censoring, respectively.

Methods:   Participants were enrolled in PLCO between 1993 and 2001 and followed for cancer outcomes through 2014. Detailed data on aspirin use (e.g., dose, frequency and duration) were ascertained via the supplemental questionnaire (SQX) administered in 2006-2007.

We conducted analyses among all women in the study sample and stratified by age at the time of the SQX.  Results:   There were 41,633 women included in this analysis, of whom 223 developed incident ovarian cancer. Overall, aspirin use was not significantly associated with ovarian cancer risk (HR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.72-1.21).

Materials and methods:   Men with suspected cancer undergoing multiparametric prostate MRI as the first-line investigation were included in the present study. Systematic transrectal prostate biopsies with/without cognitive targeted biopsies were performed. Diagnostic yields of International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) ≥2 cancers by the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) category were recorded. Impacts of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density on biopsy results and yields of non-targeted biopsies in MRI non-suspicious prostate sextants assessed.  Results:   Of 262 men (90.5% biopsy naive), 86 (33%) MRI examinations were negative (PI-RADS 1-2) and 176 (67%) positive (PI-RADS 3: 8%; PI-RADS 4: 21%; PI-RADS 5: 38%). Two hundred and thirteen of 262 patients underwent a biopsy. ISUP ≥2 cancer detection rates were 8% (5/61) for PI-RADS 1-2, 18% (3/17) for PI-RADS 3, 49% (22/45) for PI-RADS 4, and 80% (72/90) for PI-RADS 5. Proportions of ISUP ≥2 increased with higher PSA densities in positive patients (%ISUP ≥2 for PSA density groups <0.12, 0.12 to <0.15 and ≥ 0.15 was 0%, 0%, 25% for PI-RADS 3, 21%, 33%, 68% for PI-RADS 4 and 40%, 83%, 89% for PI-RADS 5 respectively). ISUP ≥2 cancers were twice as likely in tumour adjacent sextants (52% versus 24%), without upgrading of gland level histology from insignificant to clinically significant prostate cancer by the sampling of normal-appearing tumour non-adjacent sextants.  Conclusions:   One third of men can avoid biopsy after negative MRI. Cancer detection rates increase with PSA density values within positive MRI suspicion categories.

The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is an integral multifunctional protein overexpressed in various types of cancer cells. The radiolabeled PSMA inhibitor peptides (iPSMA) have demonstrated their usefulness as specific probes in the treatment and detection of a wide variety of neoplasms, mainly due to their high in vivo recognition by the PSMA protein. The objective of this research was to synthesize Lu2O3-iPSMA nanoparticles (NPs) and characterize their physicochemical properties before and after neutron activation, as well as to assess their biodistribution profile and in vitro potential to target cells overexpressing PSMA. The Lu2O3 NPs were synthesized by the precipitation-calcination method and conjugated to the iPSMA peptide using DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazocyclodecane-N,N',N″,N‴-tetraacetic acid) as a linking agent. Results of the physicochemical characterization by FT-IR and UV-Vis spectroscopies, SEM, TEM, DLS, HRTEM, SAED, DSC-TGA, and X-ray diffraction indicated the formation of Lu2O3-iPSMA NPs (diameter of 29.98 ± 9.07 nm), which were not affected in their physicochemical properties after neutron activation. 177Lu2O3-iPSMA NPs showed high affinity (Kd = 5.7 ± 1.9 nM) for the PSMA protein, evaluated by the saturation assay on HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells (PSMA-positive).

Circular RNA circCRKL (Hsa_circ_0001206) was reported to be lowly expressed in PCa tissues. However, the regulatory role of circCRKL in PCa is poorly defined.  Methods:   Levels of circCRKL, microRNA-141 (miR-141), and Kruppel-like factor (KLF5) were measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Cell cycle progression, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were examined by Flow cytometry, Wound healing, and transwell assays. The underlying relationship between miR-141 and circCRKL or KLF5 was predicted by starBase, and then verified by a dual-luciferase reporter, RNA Immunoprecipitation (RIP), and RNA pull-down assays. The protein level of KLF5 was assessed by western blot assay. The biological role of circCRKL was detected by a xenograft tumor model in vivo.  Results:   CircCRKL and KLF5 were decreased, and miR-141 was increased in PCa tissues and cells. The functional analysis discovered that the overexpression of circCRKL repressed cell cycle progression, migration, invasion, and boosted apoptosis of PCa cells. Mechanically, circCRKL could positively regulate KLF5 expression by sponging miR-141. In addition, circCRKL upregulation could hinder PCa tumor growth in vivo.  Conclusion:   These findings revealed that circCRKL inhibited the progression of PCa through upregulating KLF5 expression by sponging miR-141, elucidating a novel regulatory pathway in PCa cells.

We compared time to diagnosis between the groups, and its trend over 2006-2017.  Methods:   Clinical Practice Research Datalink records were analysed for adults with incident myeloma, breast, bladder, colorectal, lung, oesophageal, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, stomach or uterine cancers in 1/1/2006-31/12/2017. Cancer-specific features in the year before diagnosis were used to create New-NICE and Old-NICE groups. Diagnostic interval was time between the index feature and diagnosis. Semiparametric varying-coefficient analyses compared diagnostic intervals between New-NICE and Old-NICE groups over 1/1/2006-31/12/2017.  Results:   Over all cancers (N = 83,935), median (interquartile range) Old-NICE diagnostic interval rose over 2006-2017, from 51 (20-132) to 64 (30-148) days, with increases in breast (15 vs 25 days), lung (103 vs 135 days), ovarian (65·5 vs 100 days), prostate (80 vs 93 days) and stomach (72·5 vs 102 days) cancers. Median New-NICE values were consistently longer (99, 40-212 in 2006 vs 103, 42-236 days in 2017) than Old-NICE values over all cancers. After guidance revision, New-NICE diagnostic intervals became shorter than Old-NICE values for colorectal cancer.

The template-guided transperineal prostate biopsy was used for standard of reference. To compare the diagnostic performance of the two methods, the AUC was calculated. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were calculated at predefined positive values (PI-RADS ≥ 3). The interreader agreement and frequency of prostate cancer for each PI-RADS category were also calculated.  Results:   Among the 85 patients, 27 had prostate cancers, and 25 were clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). The AUC values for diagnosing clinically significant prostate cancer significantly increased with PI-RADS v2.1 for reader 2 (0.766 vs. 0.902, P = 0.009). The specificity and accuracy for both readers also increased with PI-RADS v2.1 (specificity: reader 1, 41.7% vs. 78.3% and reader 2, 33.3% vs. 81.7%; accuracy: reader 1, 52.9% vs. 76.5% and reader 2, 48.2% vs. 83.5%, all P < 0.05). The interreader agreement was good for both versions. The percentage of prostate cancer decreased in lower PI-RADS categories (PI-RADS 2) and increased in higher PI-RADS categories (PI-RADS 3 ~ 4).  Conclusion:   Compared with PI-RADS v2, PI-RADS v2.1 may improve radiologists' diagnostic performance for TZPC.""","""['Lili Xu', 'Gumuyang Zhang', 'Daming Zhang', 'Xiaoxiao Zhang', 'Xin Bai', 'Weigang Yan', 'Yi Zhou', 'Zhien Zhou', 'Yu Xiao', 'Zhengyu Jin', 'Hao Sun']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Abdom Radiol (NY)""","""['Comparison of PI-RADS version 2 and PI-RADS version 2.1 for the detection of transition zone prostate cancer.', 'Diagnostic Accuracy and Interobserver Agreement of PI-RADS Version 2 and Version 2.1 for the Detection of Transition Zone Prostate Cancers.', 'PI-RADS Versions 2 and 2.1: Interobserver Agreement and Diagnostic Performance in Peripheral and Transition Zone Lesions Among Six Radiologists.', 'Interobserver Agreement and Accuracy in Interpreting mpMRI of the Prostate: a Systematic Review.', 'A meta-analysis of use of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2 (PI-RADS V2) with multiparametric MR imaging for the detection of prostate cancer.', 'Characterization of high-grade prostate cancer at multiparametric MRI: assessment of PI-RADS version 2.1 and version 2 descriptors across 21 readers with varying experience (MULTI study).', 'Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) v 2.1: Overview and Critical Points.', 'Deep Learning in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis Using Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging With Whole-Mount Histopathology Referenced Delineations.', 'The Role of PSA Density among PI-RADS v2.1 Categories to Avoid an Unnecessary Transition Zone Biopsy in Patients with PSA 4-20\u2009ng/mL.', 'Comparison of diagnostic performance and inter-reader agreement between PI-RADS v2.1 and PI-RADS v2: systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Therefore, the development of new chemotherapeutics is of immense importance. Nanoparticle technology seems to provide diverse options in this regard. Therefore, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) loaded with Etoposide were prepared in small sizes (57 nm) and with 3.5 % drug content to improve the efficiency of Etoposide in prostate cancer therapy. Sustained release of the drug was achieved, which found to be sensitive to low pH and high temperature. The anti-growth activity of SPION-PNIPAM-Etoposide formulation against metastatic prostate cancer cells (PC-3, LNCaP) were investigated by SRB assay, then, confirmed by ATP assay. Mode of cell death was evaluated by using flow cytometry analyses. A significant improvement of nanoformulated drug was observed at 5-10 μg/ml doses of the drug in both cell lines. More importantly, this formulation enhanced the cytotoxic effect of Etoposide on PC-3 cells, which is considered more resistant to Etoposide than LNCaP and reduced the IC50 value by 55 % reaching to 4.5 μg drug/ml, which is a very significant improvement in the literature. It was clearly shown that nanoformulated drug provided about 3-fold increases in caspase-dependent early apoptotic cells in PC-3 cells. The novel formulation seems to successfully cause cell death of especially PC-3 metastatic prostate cancer cells. It should therefore be taken into consideration for further animal studies as a novel potent anticancer agent.""","""['Merve Erkisa', 'Ferda Ari', 'Irem Ulku', 'Rouhollah Khodadust', 'Yasemin Yar', 'Havva Yagci Acar', 'Engin Ulukaya']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Chem Biodivers""","""['The improved killing of both androgen-dependent and independent prostate cancer cells by etoposide loaded SPIONs coupled with NIR irradiation.', 'PSMA targeted docetaxel-loaded superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles for prostate cancer.', 'Tailor-made pH-sensitive polyacrylic acid functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles for efficient and controlled delivery of anti-cancer drug Etoposide.', 'Targeting strategies for superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in cancer therapy.', 'Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle-based delivery systems for biotherapeutics.', 'Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-Based Hydrogels for Biomedical Applications: A Review of the State-of-the-Art.']"""

From the National Health Insurance Sharing Service data, men aged ≥ 70 years diagnosed with PCa from 2006 through 2016 undergoing RARP or RT without systemic chemotherapy or prolonged androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) were identified, then the mortality was compared after adjusting host factors. Data revealed 13,952 patients with RARP (N = 7535) or RT (N = 6417). Patients who underwent RARP were younger (73.81 ± 3.58 vs. 75.05 ± 3.83 years) and had a higher income. While the majority of the RARP group (94.1%) received no additional therapy, 57.4% of the RT group combined ADT. The adjusted mortality rate for total patients was lower in the RARP group (HR = 0.767, 95% CI 0.072-0.818, p < 0.0001). From the age of 75 years, more patients underwent RT (n = 3239) than RARP (n = 2478). When dividing patients by this age cut-off, the adjusted mortality for the younger patient (70-74 years) was lower in the RARP group than the RT group (HR = 0.580, p < 0.0001). In contrast, the adjusted mortality rate for men older than 75 years was similar (HR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.897-1.07, p = 0.649).

However, the disease often relapses and the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. By performing H3-lysine-27 acetylation (H3K27ac) ChIP-seq in Enz-resistant CRPC cells, we identified a group of super enhancers (SEs) that are abnormally activated in Enz-resistant CRPC cells and associated with enhanced transcription of a subset of tumor promoting genes such as CHPT1, which catalyzes phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) synthesis and regulates choline metabolism. Increased CHPT1 conferred CRPC resistance to Enz in vitro and in mice. While androgen receptor (AR) primarily binds to a putative CHPT1 enhancer and mediates androgen-dependent expression of CHPT1 gene in Enz-sensitive prostate cancer cells, AR binds to a different enhancer within the CHPT1 SE locus and facilities androgen-independent expression of CHPT1 in Enz-resistant cells. We further identified a long-non coding RNA transcribed at CHPT1 enhancer (also known as enhancer RNA) that binds to the H3K27ac reader BRD4 and participates in regulating CHPT1 SE activity and CHPT1 gene expression. Our findings demonstrate that aberrantly activated SE upregulates CHPT1 expression and confers Enz resistance in CRPC, suggesting that SE-mediated expression of downstream effectors such as CHPT1 can be viable targets to overcome Enz resistance in PCa.""","""['Simeng Wen', 'Yundong He', 'Liewei Wang', 'Jun Zhang', 'Changyi Quan', 'Yuanjie Niu', 'Haojie Huang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Preclinical Study using Malat1 Small Interfering RNA or Androgen Receptor Splicing Variant 7 Degradation Enhancer ASC-J9® to Suppress Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Histone acetyltransferase 1 upregulates androgen receptor expression to modulate CRPC cell resistance to enzalutamide.', 'ASC-J9(®) suppresses castration resistant prostate cancer progression via degrading the enzalutamide-induced androgen receptor mutant AR-F876L.', 'Understanding the mechanisms of androgen deprivation resistance in prostate cancer at the molecular level.', 'Mechanisms of drug resistance that target the androgen axis in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).', 'Oncogenic super-enhancers in cancer: mechanisms and therapeutic targets.', 'A novel mitochondria-related gene signature in esophageal carcinoma: prognostic, immune, and therapeutic features.', 'LSD1 Inhibition Disrupts Super-Enhancer-Driven Oncogenic Transcriptional Programs in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Differential contributions of phosphotransferases CEPT1 and CHPT1 to phosphatidylcholine homeostasis and lipid droplet biogenesis.', 'Transcriptomics and Lipid Metabolomics Analysis of Subcutaneous, Visceral, and Abdominal Adipose Tissues of Beef Cattle.']"""

PET/CT (Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography) examination is important in both diagnosis and metastases.  Material and methods:   Evaluation of the importance of PET/CT examination in the group of patients diagnosed with MMU in the period 12.1.2016 to 6.12.2018. All patients with a diagnosis of secondary retinal detachment, suspected uveal melanoma, underwent standard examinations to detect possible metastases (liver ultrasound, chest X-ray). Patients for whom a stereotactic radiosurgery solution was planned due to the stage of the disease this examination was to exclude metastasis in the liver or lungs. PET/CT examination is part of the protocol within the exclusion criteria for treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery in one day session surgery.  Results:   In the group of 84 patients, 47 women (56 %) and 37 men (44 %) were aged between 26 and 90 years. Their average age was 61.4 years. The median group was 64 years, modus 65 years. Of 84 patients, 79 (94 % of cases) had a diagnosis of C69.3 (choroidal melanoma) and 5 patients (6 % of cases) had a diagnosis of C69.4 (ciliary body melanoma). Subsequent PET/CT examination in many patients did not reveal hypermetabolic manifestations that could involve various pathological processes, in others the radiopharmaceutical was captured in the primary tumor area of the uveal tract. Hypermetabolism in eye globe was only found in melanomas with a volume of more than 0.5 cm3. PET/CT examinations were 85, with one patient undergoing examination twice. However, in 25 patients (26 examinations), the radiopharmaceutical was taken up in places that subsequently required closer attention. The initial aim of the examination was to locate possible metastases of MMU. In the others, 3 incidents have been reported: increased metabolism in the lung and liver, thyroid and mediastinal lymph nodes. Of the 85 examinations, 26 (30.6 %) resulted in a hypermetabolic manifestation of accumulation, which was not located in the eye tract, resp. right in the eye. Two malignancies (prostatic carcinoma and rectosigmal carcinoma) have occurred in two patients. Very important was the discovery of MMU metastasis in the liver, which confirmed the important role of PET/CT examination in the management of MMU patients. The metastasis was discovered after repeated PET/CT examination.  Conclusion:   PET/CT examination is a technically demanding examination and is one of the possibilities of imaging intraocular melanoma in tumors with volume more than 0.5 cm3. It is important in determining the grading and staging of the disease before radiosurgical treatment and also in detecting possible metastases after MMU treatment in cases where ultrasound or MRI examinations do not give a definite result. However, our study confirmed the significance of this examination for randomly detected 2 duplex malignancies (2.4%) and 3 incidentalomas (3.6%) in patients whose ophthalmologist diagnosed uveal melanoma and sent patients for full-body PET/CT examination.""","""['M Marko', 'P Leško', 'D Jurenová', 'R Furda', 'M Greguš']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cesk Slov Oftalmol""","""['Staging Uveal Melanoma with Whole-Body Positron-Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography and Abdominal Ultrasound: Low Incidence of Metastatic Disease, High Incidence of Second Primary Cancers.', 'Whole-body F-18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging in the follow-up of metastatic uveal melanoma.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Patients presenting with stage IV uveal melanoma: Lessons learned.', 'Imaging of Uveal Melanoma-Current Standard and Methods in Development.', 'Imaging features of retinal hemangioblastoma: A case report.', 'Choroidal biopsies; a review and optimised approach.', 'Effect Evaluation of Comfort Nursing Materials Assisted Nursing for Patients with Advanced Malignant Tumor.']"""

Patients and methods:   Laparoscopic Prostatectomy Robot Open (LAPPRO) is a prospective, controlled, non-randomized trial performed at 14 Swedish centres with 68 operating surgeons. A total of 4003 men with localized prostate cancer were enrolled between 2008 and 2011. The endpoints were urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction (ED) and recurrence at 24 months after surgery. Logistic regression models were built to evaluate surgeon heterogeneity and, secondarily, surgeon-specific factors were added to the models to investigate their influence on heterogeneity and the comparison between RALP and RRP.  Results:   Among surgeons who performed at least 20 surgeries during the study period (n=25), we observed statistically significant heterogeneity for incontinence (P = 0.001), ED (P < 0.001) and rate of recurrent disease (P < 0.001). The significant heterogeneity remained when analysing only experienced surgeons with a stated experience of at least 250 radical prostatectomies (n=12). Among all participating surgeons (n=68), differences in surgeon volume explained 42% of the observed heterogeneity for incontinence (P = 0.003), 11% for ED (P = 0.03) and 19% for recurrence (P = 0.01). Taking surgeon volume into account when comparing RALP and RRP had a significant impact on the results. The effect was greatest for functional outcomes, and the additional adjustments for the surgeons' previous experience changed whether the difference between techniques was statistically significant or not. The surgeons' annual volume had the greatest effect on the recurrence rate.  Conclusions:   There was a large degree of heterogeneity among surgeons regarding both functional and oncological outcomes and this had a significant impact on the results when comparing RALP and RRP. Some of the observed heterogeneity was explained by differences in surgeon volume. Efforts to decrease heterogeneity are warranted and variation among surgeons must be accounted for when conducting comparative analyses between surgical techniques.""","""['Martin Nyberg', 'Daniel D Sjoberg', 'Sigrid V Carlsson', 'Ulrica Wilderäng', 'Stefan Carlsson', 'Johan Stranne', 'Peter Wiklund', 'Gunnar Steineck', 'Eva Haglind', 'Jonas Hugosson', 'Anders Bjartell']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Re: Surgeon Heterogeneity Significantly Affects Functional and Oncological Outcomes After Radical Prostatectomy in the Swedish LAPPRO Trial.', 'Laparoscopy/New Technology.', 'Functional and Oncologic Outcomes Between Open and Robotic Radical Prostatectomy at 24-month Follow-up in the Swedish LAPPRO Trial.', 'Urinary Incontinence and Erectile Dysfunction After Robotic Versus Open Radical Prostatectomy: A Prospective, Controlled, Nonrandomised Trial.', 'Functional and Oncological Outcomes After Open Versus Robot-assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy for Localised Prostate Cancer: 8-Year Follow-up.', 'Retropubic, laparoscopic, and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and cumulative analysis of comparative studies.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Erectile function, urinary continence and oncologic outcomes of neurovascular bundle sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for high-risk prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Is It Safe to Switch from a Standard Anterior to Retzius-Sparing Approach in Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy?', 'Perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes in patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy previous transurethral resection of prostate: a systematic review and meta-analysis of comparative trials.', 'Visuospatial ability is associated to 2D laparoscopic simulator performance amongst surgical residents.', 'Volume-outcome relationship in intra-abdominal robotic-assisted surgery: a systematic review.']"""

In recent years, some doubts have emerged regarding the clinical benefit of sequential therapy with androgen receptor axis-targeted agents (ART) such as abiraterone (ABI) or enzalutamide (ENZ) for patients with CRPC. We compared the effect of ART-to-ART (AA) sequential therapy after castration resistance with that of docetaxel (DTX)-combined sequential therapy (ART to DTX or DTX to ART) in patients with CRPC.  Methods:   We retrospectively identified and analyzed the data of 315 patients with CRPC treated in our seven affiliated institutions between 2009 and 2019. All patients received either DTX or ART (ABI or ENZ) as the first- or second-line therapy after castration resistance. We compared the overall survival (OS) and the second progression-free survival (PFS2), calculated from the initiation of first-line therapy after castration resistance, between the AA sequence group and the DTX-combined sequence group. PFS2 was defined as the period from the start of first-line treatment after castration resistance to progression on second-line treatment. To minimize selection bias from possible confounders, we performed propensity score matching using one-to-one nearest neighbor matching without replacement.  Results:   Overall, 106 and 209 patients were administered the AA sequential therapy and DTX-combined sequential therapy, respectively. The clinicopathological variables of patients were well balanced after propensity score matching, and there were no significant differences between the two groups. In the propensity score-matched cohort, OS was not significantly different between the two groups (median, 37.9 vs. 45.4 months; hazard ratio [HR], 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68-1.79; p = .701), while PFS2 was significantly shorter in the AA group than in the DTX-combined group (median, 12.9 vs. 21.6 months; HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.16-2.48; p = .007).

Methods:   To test for SNP × age interaction, we conducted a genome-wide association study using 2394 men without prostate cancer diagnosis from Malmö, Sweden as a discovery set and 2137 men from the eMERGE study (USA) for validation.

Results:   The 15 SNPs from three different loci (8p11.22, 8p12, 3q25.31) are found to have age-specific effect on PSA levels.

The multidrug resistance phenotype is characterized by cross-resistance to drugs with different chemical structures and mechanisms of action. In this work, we hypothesized that the acquisition of resistance in cancer is accompanied by activation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process, where the tumor cell acquires a more mobile and invasive phenotype; a fundamental step in tumor progression and in promoting the invasion of other organs and tissues. In addition, it is known that atypical glycosylations are characteristic of tumor cells, being used as biomarkers. We believe that the acquisition of the multidrug resistance phenotype and the activation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition provoke alterations in the cell glycophenotype, which can be used as glycomarkers for chemoresistance and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition processes. Herein, we induced the multidrug resistance phenotype in the PC-3 human prostate adenocarcinoma line through the continuous treatment with the drug paclitaxel. Our results showed that the induced cell multidrug resistance phenotype (1) acquired a mixed profile between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes and (2) modified the glycophenotype, showing an increase in the level of sialylation and in the number of branched glycans.

Effective LDH-A short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown (KD) was achieved in MyC-CaP:hPSMA+ Renilla luciferase (RLuc)-internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-GFP tumor cells, and changes in tumor cell metabolism and in the TME were monitored.

We demonstrated that miR-1236-3p significantly suppressed the AKT pathway by inhibiting TLR2 expression while activating p21 expression in PCa cells; this influence was independent of p21 activation. In summary, our results provided evidence that both endogenous and exogenous small RNAs might function to induce p21 expression by interacting with the same promoter region, therefore impeding PCa development.

How cancer cells deal with R-loops to proliferate is poorly understood. Here we show that the ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling INO80 complex promotes resolution of R-loops to prevent replication-associated DNA damage in cancer cells. Depletion of INO80 in prostate cancer PC3 cells leads to increased R-loops. Overexpression of the RNA:DNA endonuclease RNAse H1 rescues the DNA synthesis defects and suppresses DNA damage caused by INO80 depletion. R-loops co-localize with and promote recruitment of INO80 to chromatin. Artificial tethering of INO80 to a LacO locus enabled turnover of R-loops in cis.

The quantification of PSA in serum is the most common practice; however, PSA is also present in human urine, although less used in diagnosis. Herein we demonstrate the use of ionic-liquid-based aqueous biphasic systems (IL-based ABS) as effective pre-treatment strategies of human urine, allowing the PSA detection and quantification by more expedite equipment in a non-invasive matrix. If properly designed, IL-based ABS afford the simultaneous extraction and concentration of PSA (at least up to 250-fold) in the IL-rich phase.

We aimed to introduce a deep learning method to detect such patterns automatically. To do so, convolutional neural network was trained to detect cribriform growth patterns on 128 prostate needle biopsies. Ensemble learning taking into account other tumor growth patterns during training was used to cope with heterogeneous and limited tumor tissue occurrences. ROC and FROC analyses were applied to assess network performance regarding detection of biopsies harboring cribriform growth pattern. The ROC analysis yielded a mean area under the curve up to 0.81. FROC analysis demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.9 for regions larger than [Formula: see text] with on average 7.5 false positives. To benchmark method performance for intra-observer annotation variability, false positive and negative detections were re-evaluated by the pathologists. Pathologists considered 9% of the false positive regions as cribriform, and 11% as possibly cribriform; 44% of the false negative regions were not annotated as cribriform. As a final experiment, the network was also applied on a dataset of 60 biopsy regions annotated by 23 pathologists. With the cut-off reaching highest sensitivity, all images annotated as cribriform by at least 7/23 of the pathologists, were all detected as cribriform by the network and 9/60 of the images were detected as cribriform whereas no pathologist labelled them as such. In conclusion, the proposed deep learning method has high sensitivity for detecting cribriform growth patterns at the expense of a limited number of false positives. It can detect cribriform regions that are labelled as such by at least a minority of pathologists. Therefore, it could assist clinical decision making by suggesting suspicious regions.""","""['Pierre Ambrosini', 'Eva Hollemans', 'Charlotte F Kweldam', 'Geert J L H van Leenders', 'Sjoerd Stallinga#', 'Frans Vos#']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Going deeper through the Gleason scoring scale: An automatic end-to-end system for histology prostate grading and cribriform pattern detection.', 'Automated deep-learning system for Gleason grading of prostate cancer using biopsies: a diagnostic study.', 'Role of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeted Biopsy in Detection of Prostate Cancer Harboring Adverse Pathological Features of Intraductal Carcinoma and Invasive Cribriform Carcinoma.', 'Prostate cancer with cribriform morphology: diagnosis, aggressiveness, molecular pathology and possible relationships with intraductal carcinoma.', 'The New Realization About Cribriform Prostate Cancer.', 'Is cribriform pattern in prostate biopsy a risk factor for metastatic disease on 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT?', 'Artificial intelligence for prostate cancer histopathology diagnostics.', 'An update on computational pathology tools for genitourinary pathology practice: A review paper from the Genitourinary Pathology Society (GUPS).', 'Cultivating Clinical Clarity through Computer Vision: A Current Perspective on Whole Slide Imaging and Artificial Intelligence.', 'Cribriform Prostate Cancer: Clinical Pathologic and Molecular Considerations.']"""

Experimental design:   We established a novel, mechanistically informed approach to assessing tumor signaling pathways by quantifying single-cell-level multiplex immunofluorescence using custom algorithms. In a proof-of-concept study, we stained archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue from patients with primary prostate cancer in two prospective cohort studies, the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and the Physicians' Health Study. PTEN, stathmin, and phospho-S6 were quantified on 14 tissue microarrays as indicators of PI3K activation to derive cell-level PI3K scores.  Results:   In 1,001 men, 988,254 tumor cells were assessed (median, 743 per tumor; interquartile range, 290-1,377). PI3K scores were higher in tumors with PTEN loss scored by a pathologist, higher Gleason grade, and a new, validated bulk PI3K transcriptional signature. Unsupervised machine-learning approaches resulted in similar clustering. Within-tumor heterogeneity in cell-level PI3K scores was high. During long-term follow-up (median, 15.3 years), rates of progression to metastases and death from prostate cancer were twice as high in the highest quartile of PI3K activation compared with the lowest quartile (hazard ratio, 2.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-3.68).

CaMKK2 inhibition protects against prostate cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and metabolic derangements induced by a high-fat diet; therefore, elucidating the intracellular mechanisms that inactivate CaMKK2 has important therapeutic implications. Here we show that stimulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) signaling in cells inactivates CaMKK2 by phosphorylation of three conserved serine residues. PKA-dependent phosphorylation of Ser495 directly impairs calcium-calmodulin activation, whereas phosphorylation of Ser100 and Ser511 mediate recruitment of 14-3-3 adaptor proteins that hold CaMKK2 in the inactivated state by preventing dephosphorylation of phospho-Ser495 We also report the crystal structure of 14-3-3ζ bound to a synthetic diphosphorylated peptide that reveals how the canonical (Ser511) and noncanonical (Ser100) 14-3-3 consensus sites on CaMKK2 cooperate to bind 14-3-3 proteins.

Fluorescent confocal microscopy (FCM) is a novel technique that allows rapid tissue analysis.  Objective:   To determine if FCM could be used for real-time diagnosis of prostate cancer and evaluate concordance with traditional analysis.  Design, setting, and participants:   From January 2019 to March 2020, 182 magnetic resonance imaging-targeted prostate biopsy cores from 57 consecutive biopsy-naïve men with suspected prostate cancer were taken. These were intraoperatively stained with acridine orange for analysis using FCM (VivaScope; MAVIG, Munich, Germany) and subsequently sent for traditional haematoxylin-eosin histopathological (HEH) examination. Two expert uropathologists analysed the FCM and HEH cores blinded to the counterpart results in a single institution.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Agreement between FCM and HEH analysis in terms of the presence of cancer was analysed at biopsy core and region of interest (ROI) levels, considering HEH as the reference test.  Results and limitations:   FCM allowed intraoperative assessment of prostate biopsy cores with strong histopathological evaluation agreement: Cohen's κ for agreement was 0.81 at the biopsy core level and 0.69 for the ROI level. Positive predictive values (85% and 83.78%) and negative predictive values (95.1% and 85.71%) were high at the biopsy core and ROI levels. These initial results are encouraging, but given the single-centre and preliminary nature of the study, further confirmation is required.  Conclusions:   FCM allowed rapid evaluation of prostate biopsy cores. This technique is feasible and achieves rapid closure with a reliable diagnosis, parallel to the gold standard analysis. Initial results are promising but further studies are needed to validate and define the role of this technique.

In contrast, evidence on the sugar-cancer link is less consistent. Experimental data suggest that sugars could play a role in cancer etiology through obesity but also through inflammatory and oxidative mechanisms and insulin resistance, even in the absence of weight gain.  Objective:   The objective was to study the associations between total and added sugar intake and cancer risk (overall, breast, and prostate), taking into account sugar types and sources.  Methods:   In total, 101,279 participants aged >18 y (median age, 40.8 y) from the French NutriNet-Santé prospective cohort study (2009-2019) were included (median follow-up time, 5.9 y). Sugar intake was assessed using repeated and validated 24-h dietary records, designed to register participants' usual consumption for >3500 food and beverage items. Associations between sugar intake and cancer risk were assessed by Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for known risk factors (sociodemographic, anthropometric, lifestyle, medical history, and nutritional factors).  Results:   Total sugar intake was associated with higher overall cancer risk (n = 2503 cases; HR for quartile 4 compared with quartile 1: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.37; Ptrend = 0.02). Breast cancer risks were increased (n = 783 cases; HRQ4vs.Q1 = 1.51; 95% CI: 1.14, 2.00; Ptrend = 0.0007). Results remained significant when weight gain during follow-up was adjusted for. In addition, significant associations with cancer risk were also observed for added sugars, free sugars, sucrose, sugars from milk-based desserts, dairy products, and sugary drinks (Ptrend ≤ 0.01).  Conclusions:   These results suggest that sugars may represent a modifiable risk factor for cancer prevention (breast in particular), contributing to the current debate on the implementation of sugar taxation, marketing regulation, and other sugar-related policies.

Hence, we sought to assess the ability of a simple 5-item frailty index (5-iFI) score to predict surgical outcomes post radical prostatectomy (RP). Methods: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program was queried for patients who underwent RP between 2008 and 2017. The 5-iFI score was calculated by assigning a point for each of the following conditions: (1) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pneumonia, (2) congestive heart failure, (3) dependent functional status, (4) hypertension, and (5) diabetes. Multivariable regression was performed to assess the association between the 5-iFI score and perioperative outcomes. Results: The cohort included 15,546 (46.2%), 14,541 (46.2%), and 3556 (10.6%) patients with 5-iFI scores of 0, 1, and ≥2, respectively. Patients >65 years, nonwhite, and with an American Society of Anesthesiology ≥3 were more likely to have a 5-iFI score ≥2 (p < 0.0001). Similarly, a 5-iFI ≥2 score was associated with higher Clavien-Dindo grades complications (p-trend <0.0001). In addition, a 5-iFI score ≥2 had 1.66 (1.31-2.11) and 1.85 (1.39-2.46) times the odds of Clavien-Dindo grades ≥3 and ≥4 adverse events, respectively. Moreover, a 5-iFI score ≥2 had 28% increased risk of length of stay >1 day (p < 0.0001) and increased incidence of early mortality (p = 0.01). Conclusions: Frailty, as measured by a simple 5-point frailty index, is an independent predictor of adverse outcomes and early mortality in patients undergoing RP. Preoperative frailty assessment may improve risk stratification and patient counseling before surgery.""","""['Mohammed Shahait', 'Muhieddine Labban', 'Ryan W Dobbs', 'Joseph G Cheaib', 'David I Lee', 'Hani Tamim', 'Albert El-Hajj']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['The 5-item frailty index predicts 30-day morbidity and mortality in radical nephrectomy patients: A propensity matched analysis.', 'Validation of a frailty index in patients undergoing curative surgery for urologic malignancy and comparison with other risk stratification tools.', 'Modified frailty index associated with Clavien-Dindo IV complications in robot-assisted radical prostatectomies: A retrospective study.', 'Frailty impact on postoperative complications and early mortality rates in patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer: a systematic review.', 'Impact of frailty in benign gynecologic surgery: a systematic review.', 'Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy is pushing the boundaries: a national survey of frailty using the national surgical quality improvement program.', 'Preoperative MELD score predicts mortality and adverse outcomes following radical cystectomy: analysis of American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program.', 'Surgical Tolerability and Frailty in Elderly Patients Undergoing Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: A Narrative Review.', 'Does the 5-item Frailty Index predict surgical complications of endoscopic surgical management for benign prostatic obstruction?

Feasibility of TULSA for alleviating lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is retrospectively assessed in a subgroup of men from a localized prostate cancer study who also had LUTSs. Patients and Methods: TULSA was used to ablate 90% of the prostate gland in 30 men with localized prostate cancer, without plans to spare ejaculatory ducts. Mean ± standard deviation treatment time was 37 ± 10 minutes. Retrospective analysis was conducted on a subpopulation of nine patients who also suffered from LUTSs (International Prostate Symptom Score [IPSS] ≥ 12 at baseline) as well as a smaller subgroup of five patients with IPSS >12 and peak urinary flow (Qmax) <15 mL/second. Urinary symptom relief, continence, and erectile function were assessed using IPSS, International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), and uroflowmetry. Results: At 12 months post-TULSA, IPSS improved significantly by 58% to 6.3 ± 5.0 (p = 0.003), with at least a moderate (≥6 points) reduction in eight of nine patients. IPSS quality of life improved in eight of nine patients. Erectile function (IIEF-EF) remained stable from 14.6 ± 9.3 at baseline to 15.7 ± 9.0 at 12 months. The proportion of patients with erections sufficient for penetration (IIEF Q2 ≥2) was unchanged. Full urinary continence (pad free and leak free) was achieved at 12 months in all patients. In five men who suffered from more severe symptoms, Qmax increased from 11.6 ± 2.6 mL/second to 22.5 ± 14.2 mL/second at 12 months (p = 0.126). Perfused prostate volume, measured on MRI, decreased 70% to 13.6 ± 4.6 mL (p = 0.003) at 12 months. All adverse events were mild to moderate (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] Grade 1-2) with no serious events reported. Conclusions: This retrospective analysis demonstrates promising safety and feasibility of TULSA to relieve LUTSs, with improvement in IPSS comparable with modern, minimally invasive surgical therapies. Larger controlled studies with BPH-specific ablation plans in men seeking treatment for LUTSs are warranted.""","""['Dean Elterman', 'William Li', 'Gencay Hatiboglu', 'James Relle', 'Kevin C Zorn', 'Naeem Bhojani', 'Joseph Chin']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Magnetic resonance imaging-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation for benign prostatic hyperplasia: 12-month clinical outcomes of a phase I study.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation of Prostate Tissue in Patients with Localized Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Phase 1 Clinical Trial.', 'Single center retrospective analysis of fifty-two prostate cancer patients with customized MR-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation (TULSA).', 'New and Emerging Technologies in Treatment of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms From Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.', 'The impact of surgical treatments for lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia on male erectile function: A systematic review and network meta-analysis.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-guided ultrasound ablation for prostate cancer - A contemporary review of performance.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation of Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Single-Center Evaluation of Treatment Success Using Two Different Protocols for MRI-Guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation of Localized Prostate Cancer.']"""

Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine parameters for suggestion FT. Results: Two hundred ten urologists (median age 49 years) participated, from which 72% stated PCa as their main treatment focus. Ninety-nine percent of urologists were aware of and 54% wanted to improve their knowledge about FT. Sixty-five percent do not treat PCa with FT. FT is seen as an alternative to active surveillance and radiotherapy/radical prostatectomy by 66% and 37%, respectively. Regarding FT treatment strategies, 35% and 45% would treat all or all significant PCa foci, respectively, whereas 19% would treat mainly the index foci. Currently, 27% believe that FT will be an option as standard treatment in future, but 48% would not suggest FT to their patients, owing to an absence of evidence and insufficient diagnostic tools for proper patient selection today. Suggesting FT to patients is associated with self-performing FT (odds ratio [OR] 2.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.31-6.31) and believing in FT as a standard treatment in future (OR 9.05, 95% CI 6.68-22.30) (both p < 0.01).

Materials and Methods: We retrospectively examined 50 men who underwent RS-RARP (n = 25; the RS-RARP group) and CON-RARP (n = 25; the CON-RARP group) between October 2017 and June 2018. Perioperative outcomes and postoperative urinary continence were assessed in both groups. Anatomical features including the bladder neck-to-pubic symphysis ratio (determined from cystograms) and membranous urethral length (MUL) (determined from magnetic resonance imaging) were evaluated. Result: The daily urinary incontinence rate at discharge was significantly lower in the RS-RARP group than in the CON-RARP group (0.046 [range: 0.014-0.160] vs 0.357 [range: 0.139-0.616], p < 0.001). Postoperative urinary continence at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months was 80%, 92%, 96%, and 96% in the RS-RARP group and 24%, 40%, 68%, and 84% in the CON-RARP group, respectively (p < 0.001). The urgency scores in the international prostate symptom score (IPSS) questionnaire at 1 and 3 months were significantly lower in the RS-RARP than in the CON-RARP group (p = 0.028 and 0.033, respectively). The quality of life (QOL) indices were more significantly improved in the RS-RARP group than in the CON-RARP group 1 month (p = 0.027) and 3 months (p = 0.045) postoperatively. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that a postoperative MUL of 12.1 mm (area under the curve: 0.852) was the optimal cutoff value predictive of continence recovery after 1 month. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that RS-RARP (odds ratio [OR]: 23.6; p < 0.001) and prostate volume (OR: 0.926; p = 0.049) were the independent factors of a longer MUL. Conclusions: RS-RARP results in an early continence recovery and a better urgency score in the IPSS by suppressing the descent of the bladder and maintaining a long MUL.

Methods:   A total of 136 patients, including 73 patients with PCa and 63 without PCa, underwent multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mp-MRI). Radiomic features were extracted from prostate lesion areas segmented on full-field-of-view DWI with b-value = 1500 s/mm2 (f-DWIb1500), advanced zoomed DWI images with b-value = 1500 s/mm2 (z-DWIb1500), calculated zoomed DWI with b-value = 2000 s/mm2 (z-calDWIb2000), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps derived from both sequences (f-ADC and z-ADC). Single-imaging modality radiomics signature, mp-MRI radiomics signature, and a mixed model based on mp-MRI and clinically independent risk factors were built to predict PCa probability. The diagnostic efficacy and the potential net benefits of each model were evaluated.  Results:   Both z-DWIb1500 and z-calDWIb2000 had significantly better predictive performance than f-DWIb1500 (z-DWIb1500 vs. f-DWIb1500: p = 0.048; z-calDWIb2000 vs. f-DWIb1500: p = 0.014). z-ADC had a slightly higher area under the curve (AUC) value compared with f-ADC value but was not significantly different (p = 0.127). For predicting the presence of PCa, the AUCs of clinical independent risk factors model, mp-MRI model, and mixed model were 0.81, 0.93, and 0.94 in training sets, and 0.74, 0.92, and 0.93 in validation sets, respectively.  Conclusion:   Radiomics signatures based on the z-DWI technology had better diagnostic accuracy for PCa than that based on the f-DWI technology. The mixed model was better at diagnosing PCa and guiding clinical interventions for patients with suspected PCa compared with mp-MRI signatures and clinically independent risk factors.  Key points:   • Advanced zoomed DWI technology can improve the diagnostic accuracy of radiomics signatures for PCa. • Radiomics signatures based on z-calDWIb2000 have the best diagnostic performance among individual imaging modalities. • Compared with the independent clinical risk factors and the mp-MRI model, the mixed model has the best diagnostic efficiency.""","""['Lei Hu', 'Da Wei Zhou', 'Cai Xia Fu', 'Thomas Benkert', 'Chun Yu Jiang', 'Rui Ting Li', 'Li Ming Wei', 'Jun Gong Zhao']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Automated deep-learning system in the assessment of MRI-visible prostate cancer: comparison of advanced zoomed diffusion-weighted imaging and conventional technique.', 'Prostate Cancer Differentiation and Aggressiveness: Assessment With a Radiomic-Based Model vs. PI-RADS v2.', 'Diffusion-weighted imaging in the assessment of prostate cancer: Comparison of zoomed imaging and conventional technique.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer: Physical Foundations, Limitations, and Prospective Advances of\xa0Diffusion-Weighted MRI.', 'Virtual biopsy in abdominal pathology: where do we stand?', 'Automated deep-learning system in the assessment of MRI-visible prostate cancer: comparison of advanced zoomed diffusion-weighted imaging and conventional technique.', 'Radiomics in prostate cancer: an up-to-date review.', 'Adversarial training for prostate cancer classification using magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Prostate Cancer Radiogenomics-From Imaging to Molecular Characterization.']"""

Studies have shown that resveratrol (Res) inhibits cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion and promotes apoptosis. The present study evaluated the effect of Res in two human prostate cancer cell lines (the androgen-dependent LNCaP cell line and the non-androgen-independent LNCaP-B cell line) on proliferation and apoptosis. A proliferation assay was used to demonstrate that Res inhibited proliferation of LNCaP and LNCaP-B cells in the range of 25-100 µM, and the effect was time- and dose-dependent. Using flow cytometry, it was reported that various concentrations of Res induced apoptosis in LNCaP and LNCaP-B cells, and that the apoptotic effect of Res was dose-dependent. A chemiluminescence assay showed that Res inhibited prostate specific antigen levels in LNCaP and LNCaP-B cells. Reverse transcription quantitative-PCR showed that Res inhibited the expression of androgen receptor (AR) in LNCaP and LNCaP-B cells at the mRNA level. Western blot analysis showed that Res suppressed the expression of AR protein as well as protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation. To study the effect of Res on the expression of AR splicing variant 7 (ARV7) and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in prostate cancer cells, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms, the recombinant ARV7 expression vector Pcdna3.1-ARV7 was transfected into LNCaP and LNCaP cells and the aforementioned experiments were repeated. It was revealed that Res acted via the ARV7 and the AKT pathways.

However, in established adenocarcinoma, it is unknown how the ERG oncogene promotes a cancerous phenotype and maintains downstream androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathways. In this study, we utilized a murine prostate organoid system to explore the effects of ERG on tumorigenesis and determined the mechanism underlying prostate cancer dependence on ERG. Prostate organoids lacking PTEN and overexpressing ERG (Pten-/- R26-ERG) faithfully recapitulated distinct stages of prostate cancer disease progression. In this model, deletion of ERG significantly dampened AR-dependent gene expression. While ERG was able to reprogram the AR cistrome in the process of prostate carcinogenesis, ERG knockout in established prostate cancer organoids did not drastically alter AR binding, H3K27ac enhancer, or open chromatin profiles at these reprogrammed sites. Proteomic analysis of DNA-bound AR complexes demonstrated that ERG deletion causes a loss of recruitment of critical AR coregulators and basal transcriptional machinery, including NCOA3 and RNA polymerase II, but does not alter AR binding itself. Together, these data reveal a novel mechanism of ERG oncogene addiction in prostate cancer, whereby ERG facilitates AR signaling by maintaining coregulator complexes at AR bound sites across the genome.

Active surveillance (AS) is a solution to limit this problem, but eligibility criteria remained discussed. The aim was to assess possibilities of widening selection criteria for patient in AS, studying curative treatment free survival (CTFS) according to restricted or expanded eligibility criteria.  Methods:   We retrospectively studied patients beginning AS between 2008 and 2014, for Gleason 6 localized PC, PSA<15ng/ml,<cT3. The group ""strict criteria"" was defined:≤cT2a, PSA<10ng/ml, 2≤positive biopsies (PB+), total tumoral length≤3mm, tumoral invading≤50%, PSA density≤0,15ng/ml/cm3. MRI was performed at baseline and during follow-up. Radical treatment was proposed in case of biological, histological or clinical progression. Criteria associated with AS survival were analyzed by Cox regression.  Results:   One hundred eighty patients were included (follow-up 46 months). One hundred and eleven patients had ""strict"" criteria vs. 69 ""expanded"" criteria. Eighty-two patients (45%) were treated with median time of 18.2 months (CTFS was 71% at 2 years, 52% at 5 years.). The widening of the inclusion criteria was not associated with CTFS (65 vs 54% at 5 years, P=0.13). Factors significatively associated with discontinuation of AS were bilaterality (HR=2.12) and abnormal rectal digital examination cT2 (HR=2,07); MRI target (HR=2,48)) tended towards significance.

The comparative efficacy of SBRT plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) compared to fractionated radiotherapy (EBRT) plus ADT in higher-risk prostate cancer is unknown.  Methods:   Men > 40 years old with localized PC treated with external beam radiation and concomitant ADT for curative intent between 2004 and 2016 were analyzed from the National Cancer Database. Patients who lacked ADT or risk stratification data were excluded. 558 men treated with SBRT versus 40,797 men treated with conventional or moderately hypofractionated EBRT were included. Patients were stratified by unfavorable intermediate (UIR) and high (HR) risk using NCCN criteria. Kaplan Meier and Cox proportional hazards were used to compare overall survival (OS) between RT modality, adjusting for age, race, and comorbidity index.  Results:   With a median follow up of 74 months, there was no difference in estimated 6-year OS between men treated with SBRT versus EBRT regardless of risk group. On multivariable analysis, there was no difference in risk of death for men treated with SBRT compared to EBRT (UIR: adjusted HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.68-1.74, p = .72; HR: adjusted HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.76-1.14, p = .51). On sensitivity analyses, when confining the cohort to men treated with NCCN-preferred dose fractionations, with no comorbidities, or < 65 years old, there remained no survival difference between treatment groups for both UIR and HR.  Conclusion:   Within study limitations, we found no difference in survival between SBRT+ADT and standard of care EBRT+ADT for UIR or HR PC. These results support recent NCCN guideline updates, which include SBRT as a non-preferred option for higher risk men.

To date, twenty-five mammalian selenoproteins have been identified; however, the functions of nearly half of these selenoproteins are unknown. Although alterations in selenoprotein expression and function have been suggested to play a role in cancer development and progression, few detailed studies have been carried out in this field. Network analyses and data mining of publicly available datasets on gene expression levels in different cancers, and the correlations with patient outcome, represent important tools to study the correlation between selenoproteins and other proteins present in the human interactome, and to determine whether altered selenoprotein expression is cancer type-specific, and/or correlated with cancer patient prognosis. Therefore, in the present study, we used bioinformatics approaches to (i) build up the network of interactions between twenty-five selenoproteins and identify the most inter-correlated proteins/genes, which are named HUB nodes; and (ii) analyze the correlation between selenoprotein gene expression and patient outcome in ten solid tumors. Then, considering the need to confirm by experimental approaches the correlations suggested by the bioinformatics analyses, we decided to evaluate the gene expression levels of the twenty-five selenoproteins and six HUB nodes in androgen receptor-positive (22RV1 and LNCaP) and androgen receptor-negative (DU145 and PC3) cell lines, compared to human nontransformed, and differentiated, prostate epithelial cells (EPN) by RT-qPCR analysis. This analysis confirmed that the combined evaluation of some selenoproteins and HUB nodes could have prognostic value and may improve patient outcome predictions.""","""['Francesca Capone', 'Andrea Polo', 'Angela Sorice', 'Alfredo Budillon', 'Susan Costantini']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Selenoprotein deficiency accelerates prostate carcinogenesis in a transgenic model.', 'Selenoproteins of the Human Prostate: Unusual Properties and Role in Cancer Etiology.', 'Correlations of SELENOF and SELENOP genotypes with serum selenium levels and prostate cancer.', 'Monomethylated selenium inhibits growth of LNCaP human prostate cancer xenograft accompanied by a decrease in the expression of androgen receptor and prostate-specific antigen (PSA).', 'Chemical Biology Approaches to Interrogate the Selenoproteome.', 'An Integrated In Silico, In Vitro and Tumor Tissues Study Identified Selenoprotein S (SELENOS) and Valosin-Containing Protein (VCP/p97) as Novel Potential Associated Prognostic Biomarkers in Triple Negative Breast Cancer.']"""

We uncovered a novel mechanism of PTEN downregulation triggered by LIMK2, which contributes significantly to CRPC pathogenesis. LIMK2 is a CRPC-specific target. Its depletion fully reverses tumorigenesis in vivo. LIMK2 phosphorylates PTEN at five sites, degrading and inhibiting its activity, thereby driving highly aggressive oncogenic phenotypes in cells and in vivo. PTEN also degrades LIMK2 in a feedback loop, which was confirmed in prostates from PTEN-/- and PTEN+/+ mice. LIMK2 is also the missing link between hypoxia and PTEN degradation in CRPC. This is the first study to show a feedback loop between PTEN and its regulator. Uncovering the LIMK2-PTEN loop provides a powerful therapeutic opportunity to retain the activity and stability of PTEN protein by inhibiting LIMK2, thereby halting the progression to CRPC, ADT-resistance and drug-resistance.""","""['Kumar Nikhil', 'Mohini Kamra', 'Asif Raza', 'Kavita Shah']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""['Identification of LIMK2 as a therapeutic target in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Phosphorylation-dependent regulation of SPOP by LIMK2 promotes castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Synergistic targeting of PI3K/AKT pathway and androgen receptor axis significantly delays castration-resistant prostate cancer progression in vivo.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Role of PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway as a Pro-Survival Signaling and Resistance-Mediating Mechanism to Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'LIMK2: A Multifaceted kinase with pleiotropic roles in human physiology and pathologies.', 'LIM Kinases, LIMK1 and LIMK2, Are Crucial Node Actors of the Cell Fate: Molecular to Pathological Features.', 'Molecular Landscape of LncRNAs in Prostate Cancer: A focus on pathways and therapeutic targets for intervention.', 'Choosing Kinase Inhibitors for Androgen Deprivation Therapy-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'LIMK2 Is a Novel Prognostic Biomarker and Correlates With Tumor Immune Cell Infiltration in Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma.']"""

We present a series of these tumors, describing the morphologic spectrum, applying traditional and novel immunohistochemical stains, and characterizing clinical follow-up. We identified 16 cases, arising predominantly in the bladder (N=14), but also the ureter (N=1) and prostatic urethra (N=1). Six of our cases (38%) contained invasive urothelial carcinoma with admixed syncytiotrophoblasts, 8 cases (50%) consisted of invasive urothelial carcinoma with choriocarcinoma, 1 case (6%) showed urothelial carcinoma in situ with associated choriocarcinoma, and 1 case (6%) consisted of pure choriocarcinoma. Other subtypes of variant morphology were seen in 5 of our cases (31%) and included squamous, glandular, lipoid, chordoid/myxoid, and sarcomatoid features. Given the limited specificity of human chorionic gonadotropin immunohistochemistry, we also studied the expression of a novel specific trophoblastic marker, hydroxyl-δ-5-steroid dehydrogenase, as well as Sal-like protein 4. Human chorionic gonadotropin expression was seen in nearly all cases (93%) but was often not limited to the trophoblastic component, staining the urothelial component also in 85% of the cases. Expression of hydroxyl-δ-5-steroid dehydrogenase was more sensitive and more specific, staining 100% of the cases and limited to trophoblasts in all but 1 case. Sal-like protein 4 expression was variable, staining trophoblast in only 50% of cases and staining the urothelial carcinoma component in 43% of those positive cases. Most of our tumors presented at a high stage and were associated with poor clinical outcomes, with at least muscle-invasive disease (pT2) in 10 of the 14 bladder tumors (71%), periureteric fat invasion in the ureter tumor (pT3), distant metastases in 7 of 16 cases (44%) and death of disease in 3 of the 15 patients with follow-up (20%).

A German longitudinal multicentric assessment of clinical practice in urology during the COVID-19 pandemic""","""Introduction:   After the outbreak of COVID-19 unprecedented changes in the healthcare systems worldwide were necessary resulting in a reduction of urological capacities with postponements of consultations and surgeries.  Material and methods:   An email was sent to 66 urological hospitals with focus on robotic surgery (RS) including a link to a questionnaire (e.g. bed/staff capacity, surgical caseload, protection measures during RS) that covered three time points: a representative baseline week prior to COVID-19, the week of March 16th-22nd and April 20th-26th 2020. The results were evaluated using descriptive analyses.  Results:   27 out of 66 questionnaires were analyzed (response rate: 41%). We found a decrease of 11% in hospital beds and 25% in OR capacity with equal reductions for endourological, open and robotic procedures. Primary surgical treatment of urolithiasis and benign prostate syndrome (BPS) but also of testicular and penile cancer dropped by at least 50% while the decrease of surgeries for prostate, renal and urothelial cancer (TUR-B and cystectomies) ranged from 15 to 37%. The use of personal protection equipment (PPE), screening of staff and patients and protection during RS was unevenly distributed in the different centers-however, the number of COVID-19 patients and urologists did not reach double digits.  Conclusion:   The German urological landscape has changed since the outbreak of COVID-19 with a significant shift of high priority surgeries but also continuation of elective surgical treatments.

Materials and methods:   Seventy-three patients who underwent 3-T prostate MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging acquired at b = 50/500/1000/1500s/mm2 and b = 100/500/1000/1500/2250/3000/4000 s/mm2 were included. Magnetic resonance lesions were segmented manually on individual sequences, then matched to targeted transrectal ultrasonography/MRI fusion biopsies. Monoexponential 2-point and multipoint fits of standard diffusion and of UHB diffusion were calculated with incremental b-values. Furthermore, a kurtosis fit with parameters Dapp and Kapp with incremental b-values was obtained. Each parameter was examined for prediction of clinically significant prostate cancer using bootstrapped receiver operating characteristics and decision curve analysis. Parameter models were compared using Vuong test.  Results:   Fifty of 73 men (age, 66 years [interquartile range, 61-72]; prostate-specific antigen, 6.6 ng/mL [interquartile range, 5-9.7]) had 64 MRI-detected lesions. The performance of SD-ADC-2b-1000 (area under the curve, 0.82) and SD-ADC-2b-1500 (area under the curve, 0.82) was not statistically different (P = 0.99), with SD-ADC-2b-1500 selected as reference. Compared with the reference model, none of the 19 tested logistic regression parameter models including multipoint and 2-point UHB-ADC, Dapp, and Kapp with incremental b-values of up to 4000 s/mm2 outperformed SD-ADC-2b-1500 (all P's > 0.05). Decision curve analysis confirmed these results indicating no higher net benefit for UHB parameters in comparison to SD-ADC-2b-1500 in the clinically important range from 3% to 20% of cancer threshold probability. Net reduction analysis showed no reduction of MR lesions requiring biopsy.  Conclusions:   Despite evaluation of a large b-value range and inclusion of 2-point, multipoint, and kurtosis models, none of the parameters provided better predictive performance than standard 2-point ADC measurements using b-values 50/1000 or 50/1500.

Workers have found that HO-1 induction in prostate cancer cell lines (PC3) cells restored the proliferation of osteoblasts, which was inhibited during co-culture with parental prostate cancer cell line PC3 cells. However, no concrete data are available on blood levels of HO in osteosarcoma. Major role of HO-1 is the protection against oxidative injury, additionally, it regulates cell proliferation, modulates inflammatory response and facilitates angiogenesis.  Conclusion:   Findings of the present study suggests that pharmacological agents that regulate HO activity or HO-1 gene silencing may become powerful tools for preventing the onset or progression of various cancers and sensitize them to anticancer therapies.""","""['Simmi Kharb', 'M Halder', 'Z S Kundu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Ther""","""['Three hematological indexes that may serve as prognostic indicators in patients with primary, high-grade, appendicular osteosarcoma.', 'Relationships between serum biomarker levels and clinical presentation of human osteosarcomas.', 'Heme oxygenase-1 in tumor biology and therapy.', 'High serum alkaline phosphatase cooperating with MMP-9 predicts metastasis and poor prognosis in patients with primary osteosarcoma in Southern China.', 'Heme oxygenase and the cardiovascular-renal system.', 'Heme oxygenase 1: a novel oncogene in multiple gynecological cancers.']"""

The expression and biological function for miR-92a in PCa remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that miR-92a expression was decreased in PCa tissues and cells lines. Overexpression miR-92a inhibited the cell viability, migration and invasion of PC-3 while inhibition of miR-92a led to opposite alteration of cell viability and metastasis of DU-145 cells. Mechanically, we confirmed that miR-92a interacted with 3'-UTR of SOX4 through the complementary sequences by luciferase reporter assay. qRT-PCR and western blot confirmed that miR-92a inhibited the expression of SOX4 in PCa cells. Moreover, overexpression of SOX4 reversed the inhibitory effects of miR-92a overexpression on PC-3 cell viability, migration and invasion, while knockdown of SOX4 suppressed the promoting effects of miR-92a knockdown on these biological functions of DU-145 cells.

Materials and methods:   A total of 186 PCa cases of age ≤ 50 who underwent RP between 2003 and 2010 at our center were included for study. High-risk disease after RP was defined as cases with pre-PSA ≥ 20 ng/ml and/or Gleason score (GS) ≥ 4 + 3 and/or pT stage ≥ 3. The poor outcome group was defined as cases with biochemical recurrence (BCR) and/or metastasis (Mets) and/or all-cause death. Multivariate logistic regression models were performed to identify independent risk factors for both high-risk disease and poor outcome.  Results:   Among 186 younger PCa patients aged ≤ 50, 36 cases (19.5%) had high-risk disease and 24 cases (12.9%) had poor outcome. The presence of biopsy perineural invasion (BxPNI) was significantly associated with high-risk disease and showed a trend to correlate with worse outcome in univariate analysis. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, BxPNI was shown to be a significant independent risk factor with covariate of D'Amico for poor outcome (p = 0.047) and an independent risk factor with covariate of BxGPC for high-risk PCa excepting the variables to define high-risk disease (p = 0.013). Prognostically, cases with BxPNI showed a poor BCR-free survival in univariate analysis but did not reach significance (p = 0.063).

Patients and methods:   Data on 9421 patients in 25 Belgian centres were prospectively collected (2009-2016) in a compulsory regional database. The primary outcome was the prediction of continence status, using the International Consultation on Incontinence Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-UI-SF) at 12-months after RARP. Linear regression shrinkage was used to assess the association between preoperative 3-month postoperative characteristics and 12-month continence status. This association was visualised using nomograms and an online tool.  Results:   At 12 months, the mean (sd) score of the ICIQ-UI-SF questionnaire was 4.3 (4.7), threefold higher than the mean preoperative score of 1.4. For the preoperative model, high European Association of Urology risk classification for biochemical recurrence (estimate [Est.] 0.606, se 0.165), postoperative radiotherapy (Est. 1.563, se 0.641), lower preoperative European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire 30-item core (EORCT QLQ-C30)/quality of life (QoL) score (Est. -0.011, se 0.003), higher preoperative ICIQ-UI-SF score (Est 0.214, se 0.018), and older age (Est. 0.058, se 0.009), were associated with a higher 12-month ICIQ-UI-SF score. For the 3-month model, higher preoperative ICIQ-UI-SF score (Est. 0.083, se 0.014), older age (Est. 0.024, se 0.007), lower 3-month EORCT QLQ-C30/QoL score (Est. -0.010, se 0.002) and higher 3-month ICIQ-UI-SF score (Est. 0.562, se 0.009) were associated with a higher 12-month ICIQ-UI-SF score.

Normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) were also studied in comparison. VME hindered anchorage-dependent PCa cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, that is, at 1/800 (v/v) dilution for LNCaP and PC3, and 1/100 (v/v) dilution for DU-145 (corresponding to 14.15 and 113.2 μg cyanidin-3-O-glucoside equivalents per ml of culture medium), respectively.

Previous studies about the FOXA1 transcriptional network were mainly focused on protein-coding genes. Its regulatory network of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and their role in FOXA1 oncogenic activity remains unknown. Methods: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data, RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data were used to analyze FOXA1 regulated lncRNAs. RT-qPCR was used to detect the expression of DSCAM-AS1, RT-qPCR and Western blotting were used to determine the expression of FOXA1, estrogen receptor α (ERα) and Y box binding protein 1 (YBX1). RNA pull-down and RIP-qPCR were employed to investigate the interaction between DSCAM-AS1 and YBX1. The effect of DSCAM-AS1 on malignant phenotypes was examined through in vitro and in vivo assays. Results: In this study, we conducted a global analysis of FOXA1 regulated lncRNAs. For detailed analysis, we chose lncRNA DSCAM-AS1, which is specifically expressed in lung adenocarcinoma, breast and prostate cancer. The expression level of DSCAM-AS1 is regulated by two super-enhancers (SEs) driven by FOXA1. High expression levels of DSCAM-AS1 was associated with poor prognosis. Knockout experiments showed DSCAM-AS1 was essential for the growth of xenograft tumors. Moreover, we demonstrated DSCAM-AS1 can regulate the expression of the master transcriptional factor FOXA1.

Methods: In this study, we retrospectively enrolled 575 patients from two medical institutions. All patients received prebiopsy magnetic resonance (MR) examinations, and pathological evaluations of NB and RP were available. A total of 12,708 slices of original male pelvic MR images (T2-weighted sequences with fat suppression, T2WI-FS) containing 5405 slices of prostate tissue, and 2,753 tumor annotations (only T2WI-FS were annotated using RP pathological sections as ground truth) were analyzed for the prediction of patient-level RP GGs.

Here we show that activation of ADRB2 by epinephrine, increased in response to immobilization stress, delays the loss of MCL1 apoptosis regulator (MCL1) protein expression induced by cytotoxic drugs in prostate cancer cells; and thus, increases resistance of prostate cancer xenografts to cytotoxic therapies. The effect of epinephrine on MCL1 protein depended on protein kinase A (PKA) activity, but was independent from androgen receptor expression. Furthermore, elevated blood epinephrine levels correlated positively with an increased MCL1 protein expression in human prostate biopsies. In summary, we demonstrate that stress triggers an androgen-independent antiapoptotic signaling via the ADRB2/PKA/MCL1 pathway in prostate cancer cells.

Clinical evidence indicates that serum levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and biologically active DHEA remain in the high range despite antiandrogen treatment. The conversion of DHEAS into DHEA by steroid sulfatase (STS) may contribute to sustained intracrine androgen synthesis. Here, we determine the contribution of STS to treatment resistance and explore the potential of targeting STS to overcome resistance in prostate cancer.  Experimental design:   STS expression was examined in patients and cell lines. In vitro, STS activity and expression were modulated using STS-specific siRNA or novel STS inhibitors (STSi). Cell growth, colony formation, androgen production, and gene expression were examined. RNA-sequencing analysis was conducted on VCaP cells treated with STSi. Mice were treated with STSis with or without enzalutamide to determine their effects in vivo.  Results:   STS is overexpressed in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and resistant cells. STS overexpression increases intracrine androgen synthesis, cell proliferation, and confers resistance to enzalutamide and abiraterone. Inhibition of STS using siRNA suppresses prostate cancer cell growth. Targeting STS activity using STSi inhibits STS activity, suppresses androgen receptor transcriptional activity, and reduces the growth of resistant C4-2B and VCaP prostate cancer cells. STSis significantly suppress resistant VCaP tumor growth, decrease serum PSA levels, and enhance enzalutamide treatment in vitro and in vivo.  Conclusions:   These studies suggest that STS drives intracrine androgen synthesis and prostate cancer proliferation.

We exploited this adaptation by exposing prostate cancer preclinical models to high-dose iron to induce toxicity and disrupt adaptation to androgen starvation.  Experimental design:   We analyzed markers of cell viability and mechanisms underlying iron toxicity in androgen receptor-positive VCaP and LNCaP, castration-resistant DU-145 and PC-3, and murine TRAMP-C2 cells treated with iron and/or the antiandrogen bicalutamide. We validated the results in vivo in VCaP and PC-3 xenografts and in TRAMP-C2 injected mice treated with iron and/or bicalutamide.  Results:   Iron was toxic for all prostate cancer cells. In particular, VCaP, LNCaP, and TRAMP-C2 were highly iron sensitive. Toxicity was mediated by oxidative stress, which primarily affected lipids, promoting ferroptosis. In highly sensitive cells, iron additionally caused protein damage. High-basal iron content and oxidative status defined high iron sensitivity. Bicalutamide-iron combination exacerbated oxidative damage and cell death, triggering protein oxidation also in poorly iron-sensitive DU-145 and PC-3 cells.In vivo, iron reduced tumor growth in TRAMP-C2 and VCaP mice. In PC-3 xenografts, bicalutamide-iron combination caused protein oxidation and successfully impaired tumor expansion while single compounds were ineffective. Macrophages influenced body iron distribution but did not limit the iron effect on tumor expansion.  Conclusions:   Our models allow us to dissect the direct iron effect on cancer cells.

Methods and materials:   Between 2014 and 2016, patients with prostate cancer treated at our institution with external beam radiation therapy and 15 Gy single-fraction HDRB boost for intermediate- and high-risk disease according to D'Amico definition were reviewed. Intraoperative CT scan-based inverse planning and ultrasound-based inverse planning were performed in 173 and 136 patients, respectively. The following structures were prospectively contoured: prostate, urethra, rectum, bladder, and the BN defined as 5 mm around the urethra between the catheter balloon and the prostatic urethra. Dose to the BN was reported only, no constraint was applied. Acute and late urinary toxicity were assessed using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v.4.0. Clinical and dosimetry factors associated with urinary toxicity were analyzed using generalized linear models.  Results:   A total of 309 patients with median age of 71 years (range 50-89) were included. Median followup was 25 months (range 0-39 months). Using D'Amico definition, 71% of the patients had intermediate-risk disease, whereas 29% had high-risk disease. The mean pretreatment prostate-specific antigen value was 9.65 ng/mL. The mean pretreatment, after 6 weeks and over 6 months IPSSs were 8.34, 12.14, and 10.02, respectively. Urinary obstruction was reported in 14 cases (4.5%).

However, many patients do not qualify for these treatments due to prior interventions or tumor location. Such oligometastatic patients could benefit from radioligand therapy (RLT) with 177Lu-PSMA; a novel tumor targeting therapy for end-stage metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Especially because RLT could be more effective in low volume disease, such as the oligometastatic status, due to high uptake of radioligands in smaller lesions. To test the hypothesis that 177Lu-PSMA is an effective treatment in oHSPC to prolong PFS and postpone the need for androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), we initiated a multicenter randomized clinical trial. This is globally, the first prospective study using 177Lu-PSMA-I&T in a randomized multicenter setting.  Methods & design:   This study compares 177Lu-PSMA-I&T MDT to the current standard of care (SOC); deferred ADT. Fifty-eight patients with oHSPC (≤5 metastases on PSMA PET) and high PSMA uptake (SUVmax > 15, partial volume corrected) on 18F-PSMA PET after prior surgery and/or EBRT and a PSA doubling time of < 6 months, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. The patients randomized to the interventional arm will be eligible for two cycles of 7.4GBq 177Lu-PSMA-I&T at a 6-week interval. After both cycles, patients are monitored every 3 weeks (including adverse events, QoL- and xerostomia questionnaires and laboratory testing) at the outpatient clinic. Twenty-four weeks after cycle two an end of study evaluation is planned together with another 18F-PSMA PET and (whole body) MRI. Patients in the SOC arm are eligible to receive 177Lu-PSMA-I&T after meeting the primary study objective, which is the fraction of patients who show disease progression during the study follow up. A second primary objective is the time to disease progression. Disease progression is defined as a 100% increase in PSA from baseline or clinical progression.

Methods:   HC was constructed using mp-MR including intravoxel incoherent motion, diffusion kurtosis imaging, and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI from 40 tumor and normal tissues in peripheral zone (PZ) and 23 tumor and normal tissues in transition zone (TZ). HC model was optimized by assessing the combinations of several dissimilarity and linkage methods. Goodness of HC model was validated by internal methods.  Results:   Accuracy for differentiating tumor and normal tissue by optimal HC model was 96.3% in PZ and 97.8% in TZ, comparable to current clinical standards. Relationship between input (DWI and permeability parameters) and output (tumor and normal tissue cluster) was shown by heat maps, consistent with literature.

Here, we report the quality-of-life outcomes from the CARD study.  Methods:   CARD was a randomised, multicentre, open-label, phase 4 study involving 62 clinical sites across 13 European countries. Patients (aged ≥18 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2) with confirmed metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were randomly assigned (1:1) by means of an interactive voice-web response system to receive cabazitaxel (25 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks, 10 mg daily prednisone, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) versus abiraterone (1000 mg orally once daily plus 5 mg prednisone twice daily) or enzalutamide (160 mg orally daily). Stratification factors were ECOG performance status, time to disease progression on the previous androgen signalling-targeted inhibitor, and timing of the previous androgen signalling-targeted inhibitor. The primary endpoint was radiographic progression-free survival; here, we present more detailed analyses of pain (assessed using item 3 on the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form [BPI-SF]) and symptomatic skeletal events, alongside preplanned patient-reported outcomes, assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) questionnaire and the EuroQoL-5 dimensions, 5 level scale (EQ-5D-5L). Efficacy analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. Pain response was analysed in the intention-to-treat population with baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment of BPI-SF item 3, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were analysed in the intention-to-treat population with baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment of either FACT-P or EQ-5D-5L (PRO population). Analyses of skeletal-related events were also done in the intention-to-treat population. The CARD study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02485691, and is no longer enrolling.  Findings:   Between Nov 17, 2015, and Nov 28, 2018, of 303 patients screened, 255 were randomly assigned to cabazitaxel (n=129) or abiraterone or enzalutamide (n=126). Median follow-up was 9·2 months (IQR 5·6-13·1). Pain response was observed in 51 (46%) of 111 patients with cabazitaxel and 21 (19%) of 109 patients with abiraterone or enzalutamide (p<0·0001). Median time to pain progression was not estimable (NE; 95% CI NE-NE) with cabazitaxel and 8·5 months (4·9-NE) with abiraterone or enzalutamide (hazard ratio [HR] 0·55, 95% CI 0·32-0·97; log-rank p=0·035). Median time to symptomatic skeletal events was NE (95% CI 20·0-NE) with cabazitaxel and 16·7 months (10·8-NE) with abiraterone or enzalutamide (HR 0·59, 95% CI 0·35-1·01; log-rank p=0·050). Median time to FACT-P total score deterioration was 14·8 months (95% CI 6·3-NE) with cabazitaxel and 8·9 months (6·3-NE) with abiraterone or enzalutamide (HR 0·72, 95% CI 0·44-1·20; log-rank p=0·21). There was a significant treatment effect seen in changes from baseline in EQ-5D-5L utility index score in favour of cabazitaxel over abiraterone or enzalutamide (p=0·030) but no difference between treatment groups for change from baseline in EQ-5D-5L visual analogue scale (p=0·060).  Interpretation:   Since cabazitaxel improved pain response, time to pain progression, time to symptomatic skeletal events, and EQ-5D-5L utility index, clinicians and patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer can be reassured that cabazitaxel will not reduce quality of life when compared with treatment with a second androgen signalling-targeted inhibitor.

Patients and methods:   A single-centre retrospective cohort study (NCT03927287) including a discovery cohort composed of patients with an FPSAR after radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiotherapy (RT) between 2000 and 2017. For validation, an independent Biobank cohort of patients with BCR after RP was tested. Using a defined FPSAR cut-off, the metastasis-free-survival (MFS), CRPC-free survival, and CSS were compared. Multivariable Cox models determined the association between post-treatment FPSAR, metastases, and CRPC.  Results:   Overall, 822 patients (305 RP- and 363 RT-treated patients and 154 Biobank patients) were analysed. In the RP cohort, a total of 272/305 (89.1%) and 33/305 (10.9%) had a FPSAR test incidentally and reflexively, respectively. In the RT cohort, 155/363 (42.7%) and 208/263 (57.3%) had a FPSAR test incidentally and reflexively, respectively. However, in the prospective Biobank RP cohort, FPSAR testing was done on all samples of patients diagnosed with BCR. A FPSAR cut-off of 0.10 was determined using receiver operating characteristic analyses in both the RP and RT cohorts. A FPSAR of <0.10 resulted in longer median MFS (14.8 vs 9.3 years and 14.8 vs 13 years, respectively), and longer median CRPC-free survival (median not reached vs 9.9 years and 20.7 vs 13.8 years, respectively). Multivariable analyses showed that a FPSAR of ≥0.10 was associated with increased metastasis in the RP cohort (hazard ratio [HR] 1.915, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.241-2.955) and RT cohort (HR 1.754, 95% CI 1.112-2.769), and increased CRPC in the RP cohort (HR 2.470, 95% CI 1.493-4.088).

Using a kinome-wide lentiviral small-hairpin RNA (shRNA) library screen, we identified phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDPK1) as a potential mediator of cell survival in PCa cells. We showed that knock-down of endogenous human PDPK1 induced significant tumour-specific cell death in PCa cells (DU145 and PC3) but not in the normal prostate epithelial cells (RWPE-1). Further analyses revealed that PDPK1 mediates cancer cell survival predominantly via activation of serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 3 (SGK3). Knock-down of endogenous PDPK1 in DU145 and PC3 cells significantly reduced SGK3 phosphorylation while ectopic expression of a constitutively active SGK3 completely abrogated the apoptosis induced by PDPK1. In contrast, no such effect was observed in SGK1 and AKT phosphorylation following PDPK1 knock-down. Importantly, PDPK1 inhibitors (GSK2334470 and BX-795) significantly reduced tumour-specific cell growth and synergized docetaxel sensitivity in PCa cells. In summary, our results demonstrated that PDPK1 mediates PCa cells' survival through SGK3 signalling and suggest that inactivation of this PDPK1-SGK3 axis may potentially serve as a novel therapeutic intervention for future treatment of PCa.""","""['Geetha Nalairndran', 'Azad Hassan Abdul Razack', 'Chun-Wai Mai', 'Felicia Fei-Lei Chung', 'Kok-Keong Chan', 'Ling-Wei Hii', 'Wei-Meng Lim', 'Ivy Chung', 'Chee-Onn Leong']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Cell Mol Med""","""['Erratum.', 'Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 is a potential novel therapeutic target in mantle cell lymphoma.', 'Phosphoinositide protein kinase PDPK1 is a crucial cell signaling mediator in multiple myeloma.', 'Inhibition of Janus Kinase 1 synergizes docetaxel sensitivity in prostate cancer cells.', 'Colorectal carcinoma cells--regulation of survival and growth by SGK1.', 'AKT-independent PI3-K signaling in cancer - emerging role for SGK3.', 'Oscillation of Autophagy Induction under Cellular Stress and What Lies behind It, a Systems Biology Study.', 'Identification of senescence-related subtypes, establishment of a prognosis model, and characterization of a tumor microenvironment infiltration in breast cancer.', 'Identification of 11-Hydroxytephrosin and Torosaflavone A as Potential Inhibitors of 3-Phosphoinositide-Dependent Protein Kinase 1 (PDPK1): Toward Anticancer Drug Discovery.', 'Novel Gemcitabine-Re(I) Bisquinolinyl Complex Combinations and Formulations With Liquid Crystalline Nanoparticles for Pancreatic Cancer Photodynamic Therapy.', 'Hsa_circ_0000081 promotes the function of gastric cancer through sponging hsa-miR-423-5p to influence 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 expression.']"""

In the current study, the authors investigated coping and material measures of the financial hardship of these therapies among patients with Medicare Part D coverage.  Methods:   The authors performed a retrospective cohort study on a 20% sample of Medicare Part D enrollees who underwent treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide between July 2013 and June 2015. The authors described the variability in adherence rates and out-of-pocket payments among hospital referral regions in the first 6 months of therapy and determined whether adherence and out-of-pocket payments were associated with patient factors and the socioeconomic characteristics of where a patient was treated.  Results:   There were 4153 patients who filled abiraterone or enzalutamide prescriptions through Medicare Part D in 228 hospital referral regions. The mean adherence rate was 75%. The median monthly out-of-pocket payment for abiraterone and enzalutamide was $706 (range, $0-$3505). After multilevel, multivariable adjustment for patient and regional factors, adherence was found to be lower in patients who were older (69% for patients aged ≥85 years vs 76% for patients aged <70 years; P < .01) and in those with low-income subsidies (69% in those with a subsidy vs 76% in those without a subsidy; P < .01). Both Hispanic ethnicity and living in a hospital referral region with a higher percentage of Hispanic beneficiaries were found to be independently associated with higher out-of-pocket payments for abiraterone and enzalutamide.

Methods:   Interviews were conducted among women (n = 3326) aged 20-79 diagnosed with BC between 2011 and 2013 in Queensland, Australia. High-severity cancers were defined as either Stage II-IV, Grade 3, or having negative hormone receptors at diagnosis. Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) of high severity BC for variables relating to screening, lifestyle, reproductive habits, family history, socioeconomic status, and area disadvantage.  Results:   Symptom-detected women had greater odds (OR 3.38, 2.86-4.00) of being diagnosed with high-severity cancer than screen-detected women. Women who did not have regular mammograms had greater odds (OR 1.78, 1.40-2.28) of being diagnosed with high-severity cancer than those who had mammograms biennially. This trend was significant in both screen-detected and symptom-detected women. Screen-detected women who were non-smokers (OR 1.77, 1.16-2.71), postmenopausal (OR 2.01, 1.42-2.84), or employed (OR 1.46, 1.15-1.85) had greater odds of being diagnosed with high-severity cancer than those who were current smokers, premenopausal, or unemployed.

With aging of solid organ transplant recipients (SOTR), its incidence is likely to increase. The aim of this study was to analyze PC screening results retrospectively in renal transplant recipients (RTR), hepatic transplant recipients (HTR) and cardiac transplant recipients (CTR).  Patients and methods:   A retrospective monocentric study of PC diagnosed in renal, hepatic or cardiac transplanted patients since 1989 was performed. All the patients were followed annually by digital rectal examination and prostate serum antigen (PSA) dosage.  Results:   57 PC were diagnosed in 1565 SOTR male patients (3.6%): 35 RTR, 15 HTR, and 7 CTR. Standard incidence ratio (SIR) was 41.9. Mean age at the time of diagnosis was 64.5 (60.5-69.2). Mean time between transplantation and PC diagnosis was 95.7 (39.0-139.5) months. Median PSA rate was 7.0 (6.2-13) ng/mL. Clinical stages were T1, T2, and T3, respectively, for 29, 22 and 6 patients. Diagnosis was done by screening in 52 patients, after prostatitis in 1 and bone pain in another. Three PC were discovered on prostate chips after transurethral resection. Two patients were treated by active surveillance. 39 (68%) patients (25 RTR, 11 HTR and 3 CTR) were treated by radical prostatectomy. Histological results were 30 pT2 and 9 pT3 tumors, with 7 positive surgical margins. Gleason score was 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 in, respectively, in 2, 24, 11, 1 and 1 patients. One patient with positive pelvic nodes was treated with hormonal therapy (HT). One had a biochemical relapse at 10 months and underwent salvage radiotherapy. Median follow-up was 85.2 months (46.1-115.0). 23 (40.4%) patients died. Two (3.6%) RTR and 1 (1.8%) CTR died from their PC. Standard incidence ratio were, respectively, 42.4, 48.2 and 39 in RTR, HTR and CTR.  Conclusion:   Systematic screening in male SOTR after 50 years old could not be recommended. In the last 3 decades, we diagnosed too many low-risk prostate cancers strongly increasing the SIR but failing to decrease prostate cancer related mortality. SOTR should undergo individual screening with prior MRI when PSA rates are high.

Methods:   Sixty-six prostate cancer patients are retrospective enrolled, which are divided into five groups namely, GS = 6, 3 + 4, 4 + 3, 8 and 9-10 according to postoperative pathological results. Extraction and analysis of texture features in T2-weighted MR imaging defined tumor region based on pathological specimen after operation are performed by texture software OmniKinetics. The values of texture are analyzed by single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Spearman correlation analysis is used to study the correlation between the value of texture and Gleason classification. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is then used to assess the ability of applying texture parameters to predict Gleason score of prostate cancer.  Results:   Entropy value increases and energy value decreases as the elevation of Gleason score, both with statistical difference among five groups (F = 10.826, F = 2.796, P < 0.05).

In this study, we have examined the association between socioeconomic factors, using income and education as proxies, and cancer incidence in Norway, a country known to be egalitarian, with universal access to health care and scoring high on the human development index.  Methods:   We linked individual data for the total Norwegian population with information on all cancer patients registered in the Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN) with any cancer diagnosed between 2012 and 2016. Data on education, and individual income, were provided from Statistics Norway. We used Poisson regression to obtain incidence rate ratios (IRR) across education and income levels for 23 cancer sites.  Results:   A total of 9 cancers among men and 13 cancers among women were observed to have significantly higher incidence rates in cases with the lowest level of education. Melanoma for both sexes, testis and prostate cancer in men, and breast cancer in women were found to have a higher incidence rate among those with the highest level of education. The largest differences in IRR were found for lung cancer, where men and women with college or university education as their highest completed education had a two- to threefold decreased risk, compared to those with primary school (IRR men; 0.40 [0.37-0.43], women 0.34 [0.31-0.37]). The results for income mirrored the results for education among men, while for women we did not observe many differences in cancer risk across income groups.  Conclusion:   Our findings were consistent with findings from other studies showing that the incidence rate of cancer differs across levels of socioeconomic status. We may need behavioral change campaigns focused on lifestyle changes that lower the risk of cancer and target perhaps to those with lower socioeconomic status.""","""['Inger Kristin Larsen', 'Tor Åge Myklebust', 'Ronnie Babigumira', 'Elina Vinberg', 'Bjørn Møller', 'Giske Ursin']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Socioeconomic inequalities in stage-specific breast cancer incidence: a nationwide registry study of 1.1 million young women in Norway, 2000-2015.', 'Time Trends and Educational Inequalities in Out-of-Hospital Coronary Deaths in Norway 1995-2009: A Cardiovascular Disease in Norway (CVDNOR) Project.', 'Changing patterns of breast cancer incidence and mortality by education level over four decades in Norway, 1971-2009.', 'Do parental education and income matter?

In this study, a targeted analysis of the nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomic profile of PCa patients with different tumor grades, guided by transcriptomics profiles associated with their stages, was performed. Serum and urine samples were collected from 73 PCa patients. Samples were classified according to their Gleason score (GS) into low-GS (GS < 7) and high-GS PCa (GS ≥ 7) groups. A total of 36 metabolic pathways were found to be dysregulated in the comparison between different PCa grades.

Racemetyrosine (SM-88) is an amino-acid analogue used with methoxsalen, phenytoin, and sirolimus (MPS) to enhance SM-88 activity. Method A phase 1b/2, open-label trial in BRPC and rising PSA. Patients were given daily SM-88 (230 mg BID), methoxsalen (10 mg), phenytoin (50 mg), and sirolimus (0.5 mg)). Outcome measures included changes in PSA, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and imaging. Results 34 subjects were screened, 23 treated and 21 remained on study for ≥12 weeks. The median PSA was 6.4 ng/ml (range 1.7-80.1); doubling-time 6.2 months (range 1.4-36.6) and baseline testosterone 319.1 ng/ml (range 2.5-913.7). Median duration of therapy was 6.5 months (2.6-14.0). CTCs (median 48.5 cells/4 ml (range 15-268) at baseline) decreased a median of 65.3% in 18 of 19 patients. For patients who achieved an absolute CTC nadir count of <10 cells/4 ml (n = 10), disease control was 100% i.e. no metastases or PSA progression, while on trial (p = 0.005). PSA fell by ≥50% in 4.3% (1 subject). No patients developed metastatic disease while on treatment (metastases free survival =100%). There were no treatment-related adverse events (AEs) and quality of life was unchanged from baseline on the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PR25. Testosterone levels rose slightly on SM-88 and were unrelated to efficacy or toxicity. Conclusions Use of SM-88 was associated with disease control while maintaining QOL. SM-88 may delay the need for ADT and the associated hormonal side effects.

Androgen-unresponsive prostate and triple-negative breast carcinomas were studied as well as osteosarcoma, using the technique of quasi-elastic neutron scattering. The cancerous cells showed a considerably higher plasticity relative to their healthy counterparts, this being more significant for the mammary adenocarcinoma. Also, the data evidence that the prostate cancer cells display the highest plasticity when compared to triple-negative mammary cancer and osteosarcoma, the latter being remarkably less flexible. Furthermore, the results suggest differences between the flexibility of different types of intracellular water molecules in normal and cancerous cells, as well as the number of molecules involved in the different modes of motion. The dynamics of hydration water molecules remain virtually unaffected when going from healthy to cancer cells, while cytoplasmic water (particularly the rotational motions) undergoes significant changes upon normal-to-cancer transition.

A mutational signature (known as age-related signature 1) featured by enrichment of C > T mutations at NpCpG trinucleotides was associated with worse survival in TNBC (HR, 1.76 [95% CI, 1.07-2.90]; P = .025). We also analyzed gene transcriptomic profiles of TNBC samples and identified immune regulation-related gene pathways (e.g., antigen processing presentation and interferon signaling), and the cell cycle was significantly altered in samples with different signature 1 activity groups. The analysis further revealed that signature 1 was associated with decreased tumor immunogenicity and immunocyte infiltration in TNBC. This negative correlation was also observed in lung adenocarcinoma and prostate cancer samples. Furthermore, we found that patients with mutational signature 1 were markedly associated with decreased tumor mutation burden, even after controlling for age, grade, histological type, lymph node status, mutations in BRCA1/2 and ATR, and APOBEC and homologous recombination repair deficiency signatures (OR, 0.19 [95% CI, 0.11-0.32]; P < .001).

Here we describe the existence of pro-inflammatory effector T-cells that recognize ARG2 and can directly target tumor and tumor-infiltrating cells. Using a library of 34 peptides covering the entire ARG2 sequence, we examined reactivity toward these peptides in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from cancer patients and healthy individuals. Interferon-γ ELISPOT revealed frequent immune responses against several of the peptides, indicating that ARG2-specific self-reactive T-cells are natural components of the human T-cell repertoire. Based on this, the most immunogenic ARG2 protein region was further characterized.

The databases of Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (FUSCC) and Third Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University (TAHNU) served as an external validation set. Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate the relationship between risk groups and the immune infiltrate. We identified a six-gene signature to predict immune cell infiltration and outcome of PCa patients. The AUC values used to predict early BCR in the discovery, test, FUSCC, and TAHNU sets were 0.73, 0.76, 0.72, and 0.81, respectively. Low-risk score patients in each dataset experienced significantly longer OS (P = .01, 0.04, 0.02, respectively). The signature also predicted high regulatory T cells (Tregs) and M2-polarized macrophages infiltration in high-risk score patients with PCa. Additionally, high mutation load, related signal pathways, and sensitivity to anticancer drugs that correlated with high-risk score of cancer progression and death were also identified.

Accumulating evidence has suggested that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in the development and progression of various cancers, and they show great potential as novel biomarkers. However, the underlying mechanisms and specific functions of most circRNAs in PCa remain unknown. Here, we aimed to identify circRNAs with potential roles in PCa from the PCa expression profile.  Methods:   We used data downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus to identify circRNAs that were differentially expressed between PCa samples and adjacent non-tumor samples. Relative expression levels of identified circRNAs were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. Micro (mi)RNA response elements were predicted by the CircInteractome database, and miRNA target genes were predicted by miRDB, miRTarBase, and TargetScan databases. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and pathway analysis revealed the potential biological and functional roles of these target genes. A circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction network was constructed by Cytoscape. The interaction between circRNAs and miRNAs in PCa was thoroughly reviewed in the PubMed. Finally, the mRNA expression of these genes was validated by the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) databases. The expression of proteins encoded by these genes was further validated by the Human protein Atlas (HPA) database.  Results:   A total of 60 circRNAs that were differentially expressed between PCa and healthy samples were screened, of which 15 were annotated. Three circRNAs (hsa_circ_0024353, hsa_circ_0085494, hsa_circ_0031408) certified the criteria were studied. The results of quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated that the expression of hsa_circ_0024353 was significantly downregulated in PC-3 cells when compared with RWPE-1 cells, while the expression of hsa_circ_0031408 and hsa_circ_0085494 was significantly upregulated in PC-3 cells when compared with RWPE-1 cells. GO and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses found that target genes were mainly enriched in metabolic processes and pathways involving phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt signaling, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 signaling, p53 signaling, and the cell cycle. A total of 11 miRNA target genes showing differential expression between PCa and healthy samples were selected, and their mRNA and protein expression were validated by GEPIA and HPA databases, respectively. Of these, PDE7B, DMRT2, and TGFBR3 were identified as potentially playing a role in PCa progression. Finally, three circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction axes were predicted by bioinformatics: hsa_circ_0024353-hsa-miR-940-PDE7B, hsa_circ_0024353-hsa-miR-1253-DMRT2, and hsa_circ_0085494-hsa-miR-330-3p-TGFBR3.

Although screening methods for PCa have substantially improved, the outcome for patients with advanced PCa remains poor. The elucidation of the molecular mechanism that drives the progression from a slow-growing, organ-confined tumor to a highly invasive and castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) is therefore important. We have already proved the diagnostic potential of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) when detected in urine of individuals at risk of developing PCa. The aim of this study was to implement IDO as a prognostic marker for PCa patients undergoing surgical treatment. We have thus conducted an observational study by collecting 100 urine samples from patients undergoing radical prostatectomy as first treatment of choice. To test the integrity of our investigation, scale dilution cells of an established PC3 cell line were added to urine of healthy donors and used for gene expression analysis by a TaqMan assay on the catalytic part of IDO mRNA. Our data show that the quantification of IDO mRNA in urine of patients has a very promising ability to identify patients at high risk of cancer advancement, as defined by Gleason score. Our goal is to lay the groundwork to develop a superior test for PCa.

Materials and methods:   This single-center study examined individuals who underwent 3T multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and subsequent 3T IB-MRGB. The final study cohort included 379 men (with 475 targets) divided into 3 subcohorts: biopsy-naïve men (n = 123), individuals with a history of negative trans-rectal-ultrasonography (TRUS) biopsy results (n = 106), and men with low-grade PCa under active surveillance (n = 150). csPCa was defined as having a Gleason score (GS) ≥3+4.  Results:   3T IB-MRGB detected PCa and csPCa in 69.1% (262 of 379) and 50.3% (193 of 379) of patients, respectively. The PCa and csPCa detection rates per target were 64.2% (305 of 475) and 43.8% (208 of 475), respectively. The rate of urosepsis, treated with intravenous antibiotics, was 1% (4 patients). In TRUS biopsy negative results and biopsy-naïve subcohorts, csPCa was found in 36.8% (39 of 106) and 52.8% (65 of 123), respectively. In 50.7% (76 of 150) of the active surveillance subcohort, 3T IB-MRGB upgraded the GS assigned in prior TRUS biopsies. Positive predictive values of PIRADSv2.1 categories 3, 4, and 5 for csPCa detection were 24.8%, 44.4%, and 67.1%, respectively. Higher PIRADSv2.1 categories were significantly associated with PCa (odds ratio [OR], 3.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.98-5.28) and csPCa (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.03-1.94) detection. Of 137 PIRADSv2 category 3 lesions, 28 were downgraded to PIRADSv2.1 category 2, in which there were no occurrences of csPCa in histology.  Conclusions:   Use of 3T IB-MRGB resulted in detection of csPCa in 50.9% of individuals. 3T IB-MRGB has a high diagnostic yield in individuals with negative TRUS biopsy results and those under active surveillance.

We calculated the 3-dimensional (3D) displacement error between the pelvic bone and matching fiducial marker on MPCT and cone-beam CT scans of 25 patients who underwent prostate volumetric-modulated arc therapy for prostate cancer. The correlation of the 3D displacement error and the dose difference between planned and actual treatments was calculated using least squares second-order polynomial model. The 3D displacement error showed a moderate correlation with differences between planned and accumulated treatment doses (r = 0.587, p < 0.0001). Moreover, the improvement rate of the minimum 3D displacement error showed a strong correlation with the relative error between each MPCT image (r = 0.793, p < 0.0001). Significant differences were observed between planned and actual treatment doses (p < 0.0001) in the relative 3D displacement errors of <1 mm, 1 to 3 mm, and >3 mm. The 3D displacement error on MPCT (as the selection estimation index for optimal planning CT) is useful for monitoring patient-specific intensity-modulated radiation therapy quality assurance. This new method allows to estimate dose differences from the planned dose before commencing treatment, thereby ensuring high-quality therapy.

CD8(+)T cells were purified, and mRNA relative levels of Notch1-4 were semi-quantified by reverse transcriptional real-time PCR. CD8(+)T cells were stimulated with Notch signaling inhibitor γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI). mRNA relative levels of perforin, granzyme B, and FasL were semi-quantified by reverse transcriptional real-time PCR. Percentages of PD-1 and CTLA-4 positive cells were investigated by flow cytometry. Direct contact and indirect contact coculture systems were set up between CD8(+)T cells and prostate cancer cell line LAPC4 cells. The influence of Notch signaling inhibition to CD8(+)T cell cytotoxicitywas assessed by measuringtarget cell death and cytokine secretion.

Methods: The pathologically positive patients with multi-parameter magnetic resonance image (mpMRI) were included in this study. The patients with prostate specific antigen (PSA)<100 μg/L were divided into two groups: biopsy group (n=523) and RP group (n=215). The correlation between PI-RADS score and ISUP grade and the accuracy of predicting csPCa in the two groups were evaluated. In the RP group, the correlation between PI-RADS score and postoperative pathological grade or degradation and positive incisal margin was further discussed. The patients with PSA≥100 μg/L (171cases in biopsy group and 6 cases in RP group) were not included in the statistical analysis, and the results were simply described. Results: The age, prostate volume, and PSA level of biopsy group and RP group was (72±8) years vs (68±7) years, 48.3 (32-57) cm(3) vs 47.2 (32-54) cm(3), and 26.3(10.2-34.2)μg/L vs 21.7 (9.24-23.95)μg/L, respectively.

Using PI-RADS score to predict csPCa, biopsy group (AUC=0.764, P<0.001, 95%CI:0.710-0.819) and RP group (AUC=0.807, P<0.001, 95%CI:0.735-0.879) had certain accuracy. The PI-RADS score combined with PSA could improve the accuracy of csPCa prediction in the biopsy group (AUC=0.795,P<0.001, 95% CI:0.746-0.843) and the RP group (AUC=0.852, P<0.001, 95%CI:0.789-0.915). Compared with the pathological results of biopsy in the RP group, 52.6% of the patients showed upgrade and degrade of ISUP, and there was insignificant difference in the composition of PI-RADS scores between upgraded and degraded patients (P>0.05). However, 41.7%(27/65) of the patients with ISUP grade 1 biopsies had pathological upgrades that the patients with PI-RADS ≤ 3 accounted for 33.3%, while the patients with PI-RADS>3 accounted for 66.7%, and there was significant difference between the two groups (P<0.05). After RP, 43.3% of the patients had positive surgical margins, and the patients with PI-RADS score ≤ 3, 4 and 5 were 13 (14%), 24 (25.8%) and 56 (60.2%), respectively, while the PI-RADS scores of patients with negative surgical margin were 48 (39.3%), 31(25.4%) and 43(35.2%), respectively. There was significant difference between the two groups (P<0.001). The higher the PI-RADS score, the greater the possibility of the positive surgical margin. For the patients with PSA ≥ 100 μg/L, 98.8% (169/171) patients in the biopsy group had a PI-RADS score 5. The pathological results of all patients were csPCa, of which 85.4% (146/171) had ISUP grade ≥ 4. Among them, 6 cases underwent RP, 5 cases had ISUP grade ≥ 4, all surgical margin were positive, 5 cases had seminal vesicle invasion, 3 cases had capsule invasion and 3 cases had positive pelvic lymph nodes. Conclusion: ThePI-RADS score is correlated with the ISUP grade of PCa. Combined with PSA can accurately predict csPCa.

In the early postoperative period (within 30 days after surgery), no obvious complications occurred. The postoperative final pathology confirmed that all the 17 specimens were prostate cancer. After a median follow-up of 6.5 months, the patient's urinary control rate reached 81.3% at postoperative 1 month, 92.3% at postoperative 3 months after surgery, and the urinary control rate reached 100% at postoperative 6 months. Postoperative PSA value was (0.08±0.08) μg/L, significantly lower than preoperative PSA level (P<0.001). There was significant difference between the preoperative and postoperative QOL (Quality of life) score (57±5 and 47±5 respectively, P<0.001) which indicated that the patients' postoperative quality of life was greatly improved.

Methods: The clinical data of 573 patients receiving RARP from January to December 2019 in Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital were analyzed retrospectively. According to the occurrence of POI, the cases were divided into the occurrence group and the non-occurrence group. The clinical data of the two groups were compared and the risk factors of POI were investigated by multivariate logistic regression. Results: Forty-five of 573 patients (7.9%) had POI. Between the two groups, preoperative underlying diseases (cardiopathy, COPD, hypoalbuminemia), preoperative chemotherapy, preoperative WBC, operation time, blood loss, blood transfusion rate, postoperative early fever, length of stay were statistically significant (P<0.05). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that heart disease (OR=2.331, P=0.036), COPD (OR=4.285, P=0.001), hypoalbuminemia(OR=2.142, P=0.026), blood loss (≥4.26 ml/kg) (OR=2.388, P=0.010), operative time (≥225 min) (OR=4.200, P<0.001), and postoperative early fever (OR=2.773, P=0.004) were independent risk factors for POI after RARP. Conclusions: The incidence of POI following RARP is related to multiple perioperative factors. Improving the preoperative heart and lung function, correcting hypoalbuminemia, reducing intraoperative bleeding, shortening the operation time, and preventing early postoperative infection may be important measures to reduce the risk of POI in RARP patients.""","""['S H Cui', 'H J Zhu', 'Z L Ma']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi""","""['Perioperative outcomes of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy compared with open radical prostatectomy: results from the nationwide inpatient sample.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of perioperative outcomes and complications after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Comparison of single incision robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy with and without extraperitoneal special channel device.', 'Comparison of perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes between standard laparoscopic and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systemic review and meta-analysis.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.']"""

Increasing evidence has revealed that P-element-induced wimpy (piwi)-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) play an important role in tumor progression. Few studies have been explored the functional mechanism of piRNAs in prostate cancer progression. In the present study, we demonstrated that piR-001773 and piR-017184 were increased in prostate cancer tissues. Protocadherin 9 (PCDH9) was downregulated and acted as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer cells. PCDH9 could bind to p85α, the regulatory subunit of PI3K. The downregulation of PCDH9 in PCa cells resulted in an increase in AKT phosphorylation and activity. PCDH9 was posttranscriptionally regulated by piR-001773 and piR-017184. The upregulation of piR-001773 and piR-017184 promoted tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the downregulation of piR-001773 and piR-017184 markedly inhibited tumor growth.

Recently, the concept of modifying PSMA radioligands with an albumin-binding entity was demonstrated as a promising measure to increase the tumor uptake in preclinical experiments. The aim of this study was to translate the concept to a clinical setting and evaluate the safety and dosimetry of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-ALB-56, a novel PSMA radioligand with albumin-binding properties.  Methods:   Ten patients (71.8 ± 8.2 years) with mCRPC received an activity of 3360 ± 393 MBq (120-160 μg) [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-ALB-56 followed by whole-body SPECT/CT imaging over 7 days. Volumes of interest were defined on the SPECT/CT images for dosimetric evaluation for healthy tissue and tumor lesions. General safety and therapeutic efficacy were assessed by measuring blood biomarkers.  Results:   [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-ALB-56 was well tolerated, and no severe adverse events were observed. SPECT images revealed longer circulation of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-ALB-56 in the blood with the highest uptake in tumor lesions at 48 h post injection. Compared with published data for other therapeutic PSMA radioligands (e.g. PSMA-617 and PSMA I&T), normalized absorbed doses of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-ALB-56 were up to 2.3-fold higher in tumor lesions (6.64 ± 6.92 Gy/GBq) and similar in salivary glands (0.87 ± 0.43 Gy/GBq). Doses to the kidneys and red marrow (2.54 ± 0.94 Gy/GBq and 0.29 ± 0.07 Gy/GBq, respectively) were increased.  Conclusion:   Our data demonstrated that the concept of albumin-binding PSMA-radioligands is feasible and leads to increased tumor doses.

In our discovery work, elevated serum IL-8 at androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) initiation portended worse overall survival (OS). Leveraging serum samples from the phase 3 CHAARTED trial of patients treated with ADT +/- docetaxel for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC), we validated these findings.  Methods:   Two hundred and thirty-three patients had serum samples drawn within 28 days of ADT initiation. The samples were assayed using the same Mesoscale Multiplex ELISA platform employed in the discovery cohort. After adjusting for performance status, disease volume, and de novo/metachronous metastases, multivariable Cox proportional hazards models assessed associations between IL-8 as continuous and binary variables on OS and time to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The median IL-8 level (9.3 pg/ml) was the a priori binary cutpoint. Fixed-effects meta-analyses of the discovery and validation sets were performed.  Results:   Higher IL-8 levels were prognostic for shorter OS (continuous: hazard ratio [HR] 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4-3.6, p = .001; binary >9.3: HR 1.7, 95% CI: 1.2-2.4, p = .007) and time to CRPC (continuous: HR 2.3, 95% CI: 1.6-3.3, p < .001; binary: HR 1.8, 95% CI: 1.3-2.5, p < .001) and independent of docetaxel use, disease burden, and time of metastases. Meta-analysis including the discovery cohort, also showed that binary IL-8 levels >9.3 pg/ml from patients treated with ADT alone was prognostic for poorer OS (HR 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2-2.7, p = .007) and shorter time to CRPC (HR 1.4, 95% CI: 0.99-1.9, p = .057).  Conclusions:   In the phase 3 CHAARTED study of men with mHSPC at ADT initiation, elevated IL-8 portended worse survival and shorter time to castration-resistant prostate cancer independent of docetaxel administration, metastatic burden, and metachronous versus de novo metastatic presentation.

Since detection and isolation of CTCs often rely on cell dimensions, knowledge of their size is key. We analyzed the median CTC size in a large cohort of breast (BC), prostate (PC), colorectal (CRC), and bladder (BLC) cancer patients. Images of patient-derived CTCs acquired on cartridges of the FDA-cleared CellSearch® method were retrospectively collected and automatically re-analyzed using the accept software package. The median CTC diameter (μm) was computed per tumor type. The size differences between the different tumor types and references (tumor cell lines and leukocytes) were nonparametrically tested. A total of 1962 CellSearch® cartridges containing 71 612 CTCs were included. In BC, the median computed diameter (CD) of patient-derived CTCs was 12.4 μm vs 18.4 μm for cultured cell line cells. For PC, CDs were 10.3 μm for CTCs vs 20.7 μm for cultured cell line cells. CDs for CTCs of CRC and BLC were 7.5 μm and 8.6 μm, respectively. Finally, leukocytes were 9.4 μm. CTC size differed statistically significantly between the four tumor types and between CTCs and the reference data. CTC size differences between tumor types are striking and CTCs are smaller than cell line tumor cells, whose size is often used as reference when developing CTC analysis methods. Based on our data, we suggest that the size of CTCs matters and should be kept in mind when designing and optimizing size-based isolation methods.""","""['Pauline A J Mendelaar', 'Jaco Kraan', 'Mai Van', 'Leonie L Zeune', 'Leon W M M Terstappen', 'Esther Oomen-de Hoop', 'John W M Martens', 'Stefan Sleijfer']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Mol Oncol""","""['Cytometric characterization of circulating tumor cells captured by microfiltration and their correlation to the CellSearch(®) CTC test.', 'Evaluation of the diagnostic value of circulating tumor cells with CytoSorter® CTC capture system in patients with breast cancer.', 'A novel method for downstream characterization of breast cancer circulating tumor cells following CellSearch isolation.', 'Circulating tumor cells: advances in detection methods, biological issues, and clinical relevance.', 'Functional Studies on Viable Circulating Tumor Cells.', 'Detection and Molecular Characterization of Circulating Tumour Cells: Challenges for the Clinical Setting.', 'Culture of circulating tumor cells using a microfilter device.', 'Circulating Tumor Cells as Biomarkers for Renal Cell Carcinoma: Ready for Prime Time?', 'Signatures of Breast Cancer Progression in the Blood: What Could Be Learned from Circulating Tumor Cell Transcriptomes.', 'Detection and Characterization of Circulating Tumor Cells Using Imaging Flow Cytometry-A Perspective Study.']"""

""Shared care,"" delivered by both oncologists and primary care providers (PCPs), may better address these needs. Little information is available on differences in outcomes among survivors receiving shared care versus oncologist-led or PCP-led care. This study compared experiences of care for survivors receiving shared care, oncologist-led, PCP-led, or other care patterns.  Methods:   We used SEER-CAHPS data, including NCI's SEER registry data, Medicare claims, and Medicare Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey responses. Medicare Fee-for-Service beneficiaries age ≥ 65 years in SEER-CAHPS with breast, cervical, colorectal, lung, renal, or prostate cancers or hematologic malignancies who responded to a Medicare CAHPS survey ≥ 18 months post-diagnosis were included. CAHPS measures included ratings of overall care, personal doctor, specialist physician, health plan, prescription drug plan, and five composite scores. Survivorship care patterns were identified using proportions of oncologist, PCP, and other physician encounters. Multivariable regressions examined associations between care patterns and CAHPS outcomes.  Results:   Among 10,132 survivors, 15% received shared care, 10% oncologist-led, 33% PCP-led, and 42% other. Compared with shared care, we found no significant differences in experiences of care except for getting needed drugs (lower scores for PCP-led and other care patterns). Sensitivity analyses using different patterns of care definitions similarly showed no associations between survivorship care pattern and experience of care.  Conclusions:   Within the limitations of the study dataset, survivors age 65+ receiving shared care reported similar experiences of care to those receiving oncologist-led, PCP-led, and other patterns of care.

Methods:   Similar to metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) of 18F-FDG PET/CT, 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT tumor burden parameters including whole-body PSMA tumor volume (wbPSMA-TV) and whole-body total lesions PSMA uptake (wbTL-PSMA) were acquired semi-automatically. The intra-observer and inter-observer reliability was analyzed. The relationship between tumor burden and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value or Gleason score was investigated. The preliminary application of tumor burden in predicting progression-free survival (PFS) was explored.  Results:   Fifty-nine newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients were retrospectively analyzed. Semi-automatic quantification of whole-body tumor burden had excellent intra-observer and inter-observer consistency [all intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) > 0.990]. wbPSMA-TV and wbTL-PSMA were 32.6 (range 1.0-3968.2) cm3 and 161.9 (range 6.0-24971.7), respectively. wbPSMA-TV and wbTL-PSMA correlated with PSA (r = 0.858, p < 0.001; r = 0.879, p < 0.001) and Gleason score (r = 0.793, p < 0.001; r = 0.805, p < 0.001) significantly.

Materials and methods:   The Genitourinary Pathology Society distributed a survey to urology and urologic oncology-focused societies and hospital departments. Eight hundred and thirty four responses were collected and analyzed using descriptive statistics.  Results:   Eighty percent of survey participants use quantity of Gleason pattern 4 on needle biopsy for clinical decisions, less frequently with higher Grade Groups. Fifty percent interpret ""tertiary"" grade as a minor/<5% component. Seventy percent of respondents would prefer per core grading as well as a global/overall score per set of biopsies, but 70% would consider highest Gleason score in any single core as the grade for management. Seventy five percent utilize Grade Group terminology in patient discussions. For 45%, cribriform pattern would affect management, while for 70% the presence of intraductal carcinoma would preclude active surveillance.  Conclusion:   This survey of practice patterns in relationship to prostate cancer grading highlights similarities and differences between contemporary pathology reporting and its clinical application. As utilization of Gleason pattern 4 quantification, minor tertiary pattern, cribriform/intraductal carcinoma, and the incorporation of magnetic resonance imaging-based strategies evolve, these findings may serve as a basis for more nuanced communication and guide research efforts involving pathologists and clinicians.""","""['Samson W Fine', 'Kiril Trpkov', 'Mahul B Amin', 'Ferran Algaba', 'Manju Aron', 'Dilek E Baydar', 'Antonio Lopez Beltran', 'Fadi Brimo', 'John C Cheville', 'Maurizio Colecchia', 'Eva Comperat', 'Tony Costello', 'Isabela Werneck da Cunha', 'Warick Delprado', 'Angelo M DeMarzo', 'Giovanna A Giannico', 'Jennifer B Gordetsky', 'Charles C Guo', 'Donna E Hansel', 'Michelle S Hirsch', 'Jiaoti Huang', 'Peter A Humphrey', 'Rafael E Jimenez', 'Francesca Khani', 'Max X Kong', 'Oleksandr N Kryvenko', 'L Priya Kunju', 'Priti Lal', 'Mathieu Latour', 'Tamara Lotan', 'Fiona Maclean', 'Cristina Magi-Galluzzi', 'Rohit Mehra', 'Santosh Menon', 'Hiroshi Miyamoto', 'Rodolfo Montironi', 'George J Netto', 'Jane K Nguyen', 'Adeboye O Osunkoya', 'Anil Parwani', 'Christian P Pavlovich', 'Brian D Robinson', 'Mark A Rubin', 'Rajal B Shah', 'Jeffrey S So', 'Hiroyuki Takahashi', 'Fabio Tavora', 'Maria S Tretiakova', 'Lawrence True', 'Sara E Wobker', 'Ximing J Yang', 'Ming Zhou', 'Debra L Zynger', 'Jonathan I Epstein']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['The 2019 Genitourinary Pathology Society (GUPS) White Paper on Contemporary Grading of Prostate Cancer.', 'Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'Role of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeted Biopsy in Detection of Prostate Cancer Harboring Adverse Pathological Features of Intraductal Carcinoma and Invasive Cribriform Carcinoma.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.', 'Reports of prostate needle biopsies-what pathologists provide and urologists want.', 'A distinct repertoire of cancer-associated fibroblasts is enriched in cribriform prostate cancer.']"""

The aim of our study was to reveal changes in miRNA expression profiles associated with lymphatic dissemination in prostate cancer and to identify the most prominent miRNAs as potential prognostic markers for future studies.  Methods:   High-throughput miRNA sequencing was performed for 44 prostate cancer specimens taken from Russian patients, with and without lymphatic dissemination (N1 - 20 samples; N0 - 24 samples).  Results:   We found at least 18 microRNAs with differential expression between N0 and N1 sample groups: miR-182-5p, miR-183-5p, miR-96-5p, miR-25-3p, miR-93-5p, miR-7-5p, miR-615-3p, miR-10b, miR-1248 (N1-miRs; elevated expression in N1 cohort; p < 0.05); miR-1271-5p, miR-184, miR-222-3p, miR-221-5p, miR-221-3p, miR-455-3p, miR-143-5p, miR-181c-3p and miR-455-5p (N0-miRs; elevated expression in N0; p < 0.05). The expression levels of N1-miRs were highly correlated between each other (the same is applied for N0-miRs) and the expression levels of N0-miRs and N1-miRs were anti-correlated. The tumor samples can be divided into two groups depending on the expression ratio between N0-miRs and N1-miRs.  Conclusions:   We found the miRNA expression signature associated with lymphatic dissemination, in particular on the Russian patient cohort.

Methods:   ine thousand four hundred fifty-nine patients with PCa were extracted from the South Australian Prostate Cancer Clinical Outcomes Collaborative (SA-PCCOC) database. Diagnosis occurred after 1998 and treatment before 2014. Cox proportional-hazards modeling was used to assess the effect of family history on overall survival after adjustment for confounders (age at diagnosis, NCCN risk category and year of treatment), and with stratification by primary treatment group. Competing risks regression modelling was used to assess PCa specific mortality.  Results:   Men with a positive family history of PCa appear to have a lower Gleason score at the time of diagnosis (50% with Gleason < 7, compared to 39% in those without family history) and be diagnosed at a lower age (64 vs 69). Men with a positive family history of PCa appear to have better overall survival outcomes (p < 0.001, log rank test). In analysis adjusting for age at diagnosis, NCCN risk category and year of treatment, family history remained a significant factor when modelling overall survival (HR 0.72 95% CI 0.55-0.95, p = 0.021). There were no significant differences in treatment subgroups of radical prostatectomy (p = 0.7) and radiotherapy (0.054).  Conclusion:   Men with a positive family history of PCa appear to have better overall survival outcomes. This better survival may represent lead time bias and early initiation of PSA screening.

An immunoassay platform is presented herein for ultrasensitive and fast detection of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a well-recognized cancer biomarker. A sandwich type immunosensor has been developed employing a detection antibody labeled with inorganic nanoparticles acting as tags for further indirect quantification of the analyte. The required high sensitivity is then achieved through a controlled gold deposition on the nanoparticle surface, carried out after completing the recognition step of the immunoassay, thus effectively amplifying the size of the nanoparticles from nm to µm range. Due to such an amplification procedure, quantification of the biomolecule could be carried out directly on the immunoassay plates using confocal microscopy for measurement of the reflected light produced by gold-enlarged nanostructures. The high specificity of the immunoassay was demonstrated with the addition of a major abundant protein in serum (albumin) at much higher concentrations. An extremely low detection limit for PSA quantification (LOD of 1.1 fg·mL-1 PSA) has been achieved. Such excellent LOD is 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than the clinically relevant PSA levels present in biological samples (4-10 ng·mL-1) and even to monitor eventual recurrence after clinical treatment of a prostate tumor (0.1 ng·mL-1). In fact, the broad dynamic range obtained (4 orders of magnitude) would allow the PSA quantification of diverse samples at very different relevant levels.""","""['Laura Cid-Barrio', 'Jorge Ruiz Encinar', 'José Manuel Costa-Fernández']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Sensors (Basel)""","""['Highly sensitive nanoparticle-based immunoassays with elemental detection: Application to Prostate-Specific Antigen quantification.', 'Ultrasensitive electrochemical immunosensor for PSA biomarker detection in prostate cancer cells using gold nanoparticles/PAMAM dendrimer loaded with enzyme linked aptamer as integrated triple signal amplification strategy.', 'Bio-bar-code-based photoelectrochemical immunoassay for sensitive detection of prostate-specific antigen using rolling circle amplification and enzymatic biocatalytic precipitation.', 'Electrochemical Immunosensors Based on Nanostructured Materials for Sensing of Prostate-Specific Antigen: A Review.', 'Recent advances in gold nanoparticle-based lateral flow immunoassay for the detection of bacterial infection.', 'Bio-Tailored Sensing at the Nanoscale: Biochemical Aspects and Applications.', 'Optical Microscopy Systems for the Detection of Unlabeled Nanoparticles.']"""

Methods:   We searched the MUSIC registry for men with FRPC managed with AS without or with a confirmatory test. Confirmatory tests included (1) repeat prostate biopsy, (2) genomic tests, (3) prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or (4) MRI followed by a post-MRI biopsy. Confirmatory test results were deemed reassuring (RA) or nonreassuring (nonRA) according to predefined criteria. Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariable Cox regression models were used to compare surveillance biopsy disease reclassification-free survival and treatment-free survival.  Results:   Of the 2,514 men with FRPC who were managed on AS, 1211 (48%) men obtained a confirmatory test. We noted differences in the 12-month unadjusted surveillance biopsy disease reclassification-free probability (68%, 83%, and 90%, P < .0001) and 24-month unadjusted treatment-free probability (55%, 81%, and 79%, P < .0001), for men with nonRA confirmatory tests, no confirmatory test, and RA confirmatory tests, respectively. Excluding patients with genomic confirmatory tests, men with RA confirmatory tests were associated with a lower hazard (hazard ratio [HR] 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.38-0.84, P = .005) and men with nonRA confirmatory tests had an increased hazard (HR 1.97, 95% CI 1.22-3.19, P = .006) of surveillance disease reclassification compared with men without confirmatory tests in the multivariable model.

We hypothesized that certain histopathologic features that were not considered in the original design of the assay actually would be associated with the NCCN risk category change indicated by GPS testing.  Methods:   For patients with recommended NCCN risk category change, the biopsy cores used for GPS were re-reviewed for stromal reaction, chronic inflammation, and tumor nuclear polarization.  Results:   Of 520 patients from May 2011 to December 2018, GPS testing suggested NCCN risk reclassification in 131 (25%); 127 of these slides were available. Of these, the NCCN risk category increased from intermediate to high in 8, low to intermediate in 15, very low to low in 1, and decreased from intermediate to low in 32, and low to very low in 71. Biopsies with NCCN risk increase were associated with moderate or severe stromal reaction (p < .001) and chronic inflammation (p < .001); biopsies with NCCN risk decrease were associated with absence of these features. In Gleason 3 + 3 = 6 cases (n = 93), presence of nuclear polarization was associated with NCCN risk decrease and its absence with increase (p < .001).  Conclusions:   Moderate or severe stromal reaction, chronic inflammation, and lack of nuclear polarization in Gleason score 3 + 3 = 6 tumors were each associated with an increase in NCCN risk category indicated by GPS and vice versa. Our results suggest that GPS captures histologic features associated with aggressiveness that are not routinely assessed in standard histopathologic assessments, and that consideration of such histologic features may improve upon current tumor grading approaches.""","""['Nancy Y Greenland', 'Janet E Cowan', 'Emily Chan', 'Peter R Carroll', 'Bradley A Stohr', 'Jeffry P Simko']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Correlation of a Commercial Genomic Risk Classifier with Histological Patterns in Prostate Cancer.', 'A Biopsy-based 17-gene Genomic Prostate Score Predicts Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy and Adverse Surgical Pathology in a Racially Diverse Population of Men with Clinically Low- and Intermediate-risk Prostate Cancer.', 'A 17-Gene Genomic Prostate Score as a Predictor of Adverse Pathology in Men on Active Surveillance.', 'The Clinical Utility of the Genomic Prostate Score in Men with Very Low to Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'A Biopsy-based 17-gene Genomic Prostate Score as a Predictor of Metastases and Prostate Cancer Death in Surgically Treated Men with Clinically Localized Disease.', 'GPS Assay Association With Long-Term Cancer Outcomes: Twenty-Year Risk of Distant Metastasis and Prostate Cancer-Specific Mortality.']"""

However, patients may experience primary resistance to treatment. To date, few predictive biomarkers of efficacy have been identified. Our aim was to investigate the association between the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) c.-362T>C in the CYP17A1 gene, and clinical outcome in mCRPC patients treated with abiraterone.  Patients and methods:   mCRPC patients candidate to receive abiraterone were enrolled in the present retrospective pharmacogenetic study. Based on a literature selection, CYP17A1 rs2486758 (c.-362T > C) was selected and analysed by real-time PCR on genomic DNA extracted from whole blood. Univariate analysis was performed to test the association between the SNP and treatment-related clinical outcomes.  Results:   Sixty mCRPC patients were enrolled in the present study. Patients carrying the mutant CYP17A1 c.-362CT/CC genotypes showed a shorter median progression-free survival (PFS) and prostate-specific antigen-PFS (PSA-PFS) compared to patients carrying the TT genotype (10.7 vs 14.2 months and 8 vs 16 months, respectively; p = 0.04). No association between the selected SNP and the overall survival was found.

It is critical to explore noninvasive assays for the early detection of this aggressive subtype, when it still can be treated effectively. Additionally, there is an emerging need to develop markers that perform equally well across races, as racial differences in the prevalence and mortality of prostate cancer has become evident.  Materials and methods:   First catch, nondigital rectal examination urine specimens were collected from patients undergoing diagnostic biopsy. Total RNA was extracted from urinary exosomes and a quantitative expression assay protocol using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction was developed for detection of candidate genes in exosomal mRNAs from urine. Clinical performance for the gene expression assay was evaluated to predict high grade cancer (Gleason score 7-10) from low grade cancer (Gleason score 6) and cancer negative cases at biopsy. Assay performance was examined in combination with standard of care to determine improvement in model prediction.  Results:   In a racially diverse patient cohort a 2-gene panel (PCA3, PCGEM1), in combination with standard of care variables, significantly improved the prediction of high grade cancer at diagnosis compared to standard of care variables alone (AUC 0.88 vs 0.80, respectively, p=0.016).

Material and methods:   Two hundred treatment sessions in 40 patients affected by low and intermediate PCa were evaluated. The prescribed dose was 35 Gy in 5 fractions delivered on alternate days. MRgRT patients (10) were daily recontoured, re-planned, and treated with IMRT technique. IGRT patients without (20) and with (10) fiducials were matched on soft tissues or fiducials and treated with VMAT technique. Respective CBCTs were retrospectively delineated and the prescribed plan was overlaid for dosimetric analysis. The daily dose for rectum, bladder, and prostate was registered.  Results:   MRgRT resulted in a significantly lower rate of constraints violation as compared to IGRT without fiducials, especially for rectum V28Gy, rectum V32Gy, rectum V35Gy, rectum Dmax, and bladder Dmax. IGRT with fiducials reported high accuracy levels, comparable to MRgRT. MRgRT and IGRT with fiducials reported no significant prostate CTV underdosage, while IGRT without fiducials was associated with occasional cases of prostate CTV under dosage.  Conclusion:   MR-guided daily-adaptive SBRT seems a feasible and accurate strategy for treating prostate cancer with ablative doses. IGRT with the use of fiducials provides a comparable level of accuracy and acceptable real-dose distribution over treatment fractions.

Caring for a family member with advanced prostate cancer in the home presents practical and emotional challenges, especially in resource-poor contexts, where there are increasing palliative cases without adequate palliative care institutions.  Aim:   The study explored palliative and end-of-life care experiences of family caregivers and patients living at home in a resource-poor context in Ghana.  Design:   This is a qualitative study using thematic analysis of face-to-face interviews at two-time points.  Participants:   Men living with advanced prostate cancer (n = 23), family caregivers (n = 23), healthcare professionals (n = 12).  Findings:   Men with advanced prostate cancer face complex issues, including lack of access to professional care and a lack of resources for homecare. Family caregivers do not have easy access to professional support; they often have limited knowledge of disease progression. Patients have inadequate access to medication and other practical resources for homecare. Caregivers may be overburdened and perform the role of the patient's 'doctor' at home-assessing patient's symptoms, administering drugs, and providing hands-on care.  Conclusion:   Home-based care is promoted as an ideal and cost-effective model of care, particularly in Westernised palliative care models. However, in resource-poor contexts, there are significant challenges associated with the implementation of this model. This study revealed the scale of challenges family caregivers, who lack basic training on aspects of caring, face in providing home care unsupported by healthcare professionals.""","""['Yakubu Salifu', 'Kathryn Almack', 'Glenys Caswell']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Palliat Med""","""['""I didn\'t want to be in charge and yet I was"": Bereaved caregivers\' accounts of providing home care for family members with advanced cancer.', 'Palliative care experiences of adult cancer patients from ethnocultural groups: a qualitative systematic review protocol.', ""'You only have one chance to get it right': A qualitative study of relatives' experiences of caring at home for a family member with terminal cancer."", 'Home palliative care works: but how?

Methods:   We consecutive enrolled 93 patients with prostate cancer whose underwent RALP at our department from January 2019 to December 2019. Group A included 45 patients who received bilateral TAP block, and Group B included 48 patients who did not received TAP block. TAP blocks were always performed by a single anesthesia team. An elastomeric pump device was used in all patients for post-operative pain management. TAP block was performed according to Rafi's technique, with Ropivacaine 0.375% and dexamethasone 4 mg. Mean values with standard deviations (±SD) were computed and reported for all items. Statistical significance was achieved if p-value was ⩽0.05 (two-sides).  Results:   The two groups showed no difference in the most important demographics and baseline characteristics (p > 0.05). Group A showed a significant longer time of anaesthesia. Moreover, Ketorolac doses (started dose plus continuous post-operative infusion via elastomeric pump) used in Group A were significantly lower than Group B. Despite this, Group B showed statistical significant higher value of NRS PACU and at 12, 24, 48, 72 h than Group A but not at 96 h. Rescue analgesic medication use was significantly higher in the Group B than Group A. Moreover, patency of the intestinal tract and time to ambulation was significantly lower in the Group A.  Discussion:   The use of TAP block during a RALP is a safe procedure that can be applied more appropriately to achieve better pain control. A multimodal protocol that includes locoregional anesthesia, reduction of intra and postoperative use of strong opiates, correct placing of the patient and the use of low pneumoperitoneum pressures should be implemented in order to reach a faster and better post-operative full recovery of patients whose underwent RALP.""","""['Francesco Chiancone', 'Marco Fabiano', 'Maria Ferraiuolo', 'Lucia de Rosa', 'Elena Prisco', 'Maurizio Fedelini', 'Clemente Meccariello', 'Giulio Visciola', 'Paolo Fedelini']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Urologia""","""['Use of transversus abdominis plane block to decrease pain scores and narcotic use following robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.', 'Impact of Combination of Local Anesthetic Wounds Infiltration and Ultrasound Transversus Abdominal Plane Block in Patients Undergoing Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Perioperative Results of a Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial.', 'Robot-Assisted Transversus Abdominis Plane Block: Description of the Technique and Comparative Analysis.', 'The Role of Transversus Abdominis Plane Blocks in Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Pathways for Open and Laparoscopic Colorectal Surgery.', 'Perioperative transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks for analgesia after abdominal surgery.', 'Surgeon administered transversus abdominis plane block: anatomic principles and technique.']"""

We predicted the transcriptomic profile of citalopram remitters by performing an in silico transcriptomic-wide association study on STAR*D GWAS data (N = 1163). The transcriptional profile of remitters was compared with 21 antidepressant-induced gene expression profiles in five human cell lines available in the connectivity-map database. Spearman correlation, Pearson correlation, and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test were used to determine the similarity between antidepressant-induced profiles and remitter profiles, subsequently calculating the average rank of antidepressants across the three methods and a p value for each rank by using a permutation procedure. The drugs with the top ranks were those having a high positive correlation with the expression profiles of remitters and that may have higher chances of efficacy in the tested patients. In MCF7 (breast cancer cell line), escitalopram had the highest average rank, with an average rank higher than expected by chance (p = 0.0014).

Although being developed as a local therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia and localized prostate cancer, PRX302 cannot be administered systemically as a treatment for metastatic disease due to binding to ubiquitously expressed glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, which leads to poor accumulation within the tumor microenvironment. To overcome this limitation, poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) microparticles encapsulating the protoxin were developed, which are known to accumulate in the liver, a major site of metastasis for prostate cancer and other solid tumors. A highly sensitive and reproducible sandwich ELISA to quantify PRX302 released from microparticles was developed. Utilizing this assay, PRX302 release from different microparticle formulations was assessed over multiple days. Hemolysis assays documented PSA-dependent pore formation and lytic potential (i.e., function) of the released protoxin.

In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which prostate cancer cells undergo senescence in response to ADT, and determined whether an FDA-approved antidiabetic drug metformin has a synergistic effect with ADT in prostate cancer both in vitro and in vivo Our results show that longer term exposure to ADT induced senescence associated with p16INK4a and/or p27kip2 induction. The activation of PI3K/AKT and inactivation of AMPK in senescent cells resulted in mTORC1 activation. In addition, the antiapoptotic protein XIAP expression was increased in response to ADT. The addition of metformin following ADT induced apoptosis, attenuated mTOR activation, reduced senescent cell number in vitro, and inhibited tumor growth in prostate cancer patient-derived xenograft models.

We conducted a phase I trial investigating the safety and pharmacokinetics of a potent c-MET inhibitor, crizotinib, with the AR antagonist, enzalutamide, in CRPC.  Patients and methods:   Employing a 3+3 dose-escalation design, we tested three dose levels of crizotinib (250 mg daily, 200 mg twice a day, and 250 mg twice a day) with standard-dose enzalutamide (160 mg daily). The primary endpoint was rate of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Tolerability and pharmacokinetics profile were secondary endpoints.  Results:   Twenty-four patients were enrolled in the dose-escalation (n = 16) and dose-expansion (n = 8) phases. Two DLTs occurred in dose escalation (grade 3 alanine aminotransferase elevation). The MTD of crizotinib was 250 mg twice a day. Most frequent treatment-related adverse events were fatigue (50%), transaminitis (38%), nausea (33%), and vomiting, constipation, and diarrhea (21% each). Grade ≥3 events (25%) included transaminitis (n = 2), fatigue (n = 1), hypertension (n = 1), pulmonary embolism (n = 1), and a cardiac event encompassing QTc prolongation/ventricular arrhythmia/cardiac arrest. Median progression-free survival was 5.5 months (95% confidence interval, 2.8-21.2). Pharmacokinetics analysis at the MTD (n = 12) revealed a mean C max ss of 104 ± 45 ng/mL and AUCτ ss of 1,000 ± 476 ng•h/mL, representing a 74% decrease in crizotinib systemic exposure relative to historical data (C max ss, 315 ng/mL and AUCτ ss, 3,817 ng•h/mL).  Conclusions:   Concurrent administration of enzalutamide and crizotinib resulted in a clinically significant 74% decrease in systemic crizotinib exposure.

A provincial Phase II pilot for the tool had stated (based on stakeholder feedback) that there was a need to: ""Develop training and resources for patients and clinicians that facilitate the interpretation of patient reported outcomes measures (PROMs) …."" With this recommendation in mind, the working group aimed to develop and implement a training and education plan. The plan would support healthcare professionals (HCPs) in their clinical response to the PROM tool symptom screening scores.The aim was to encourage evidence based symptom management and therefore improve care for patients.  Process:   A questionnaire was developed to elicit information regarding HCP's comfort level and knowledge related to issues experienced by prostate cancer patients. The issues were categorised according to the domains identified within the screening tool, i.e., bowel, urinary, sexual and hormonal/vitality domains. The questionnaire was emailed to all identified stakeholders via institutional email. Feedback from the questionnaire was utilised to develop an education work plan. Five education sessions were developed with pre session materials shared via email. Each session was evaluated via an anonymous and voluntary three item questionnaire completed at the end of each session. Chart audits of 20 prostate cancer patients' electronic medical records (EMR) were carried out pre and post launch of the education program and the novel screening tool. The audit process was to support assessment of any changes in HCPs clinical response to prostate cancer patient issues.  Results:   There were 50 responses to the preliminary needs assessment questionnaire (approximately 29% response rate). The sexual health domain was identified as the one with which HCPs had the least knowledge and comfort level. Five education sessions were developed and carried out with an average attendance of 14 HCPs from a variety of disciplines. Feedback demonstrated that the majority of attendees agreed or strongly agreed that the sessions increased their knowledge on each of the topics and that they were deemed useful for their clinical practice.The audit data showed differences in documentation of patient issues pre and post education program and implementation of the novel screening tool.  Conclusions:   Employing a systematic approach, with interprofessional engagement, can support successful adoption of new initiatives such as a novel site specific screening tool. Ongoing assessment of HCPs education needs can be carried out using this process. Establishing a database of resources to facilitate independent education may be useful for some HCPs.""","""['Angela Turner', 'Stephanie Burlein-Hall', 'Manisha Gandhi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Med Imaging Radiat Sci""","""['The effectiveness of internet-based e-learning on clinician behavior and patient outcomes: a systematic review protocol.', 'A pilot evaluation of the expanded prostate cancer index composite for clinical practice (EPIC-CP) tool in Ontario.', 'Developing theory-informed knowledge translation strategies to facilitate the use of patient-reported outcome measures in interdisciplinary low back pain clinical practices in Quebec: mixed methods study.', 'Faculty development initiatives designed to promote leadership in medical education.

This study examined variables associated with patient-reported care coordination scores among Medicare beneficiaries with a history of cancer.  Methods:   We utilized Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (SEER-CAHPS) linked data, which includes cancer registry data, patient experience surveys, and Medicare claims. We identified Medicare beneficiaries with a CAHPS survey ≤10 years after cancer diagnosis who reported seeing a personal doctor within six months. Multivariable regression models examined associations between cancer survivor characteristics and patient-reported care coordination, with higher scores indicating better coordination.  Results:   Cancer site distribution of the 14,646 survey respondents was 33.7% prostate, 22.1% breast, 11.1% colorectal, 7.2% lung, and 25.9% other. Rural residence at diagnosis (versus urban, 1.1-point difference; p = 0.04) and reporting >4 visits with a personal doctor (versus 1-2 visits, 3.0-point difference; p < 0.001) were significantly associated with higher care coordination. Older age (p < 0.001) and seeing more specialists (p = 0.006) were associated with significantly lower care coordination. Patients with melanoma (women: 5.2-point difference, p < 0.001; men: 2.7 points, p = 0.01) or breast cancer (women: 2.4 points; p < 0.001) reported significantly lower care coordination scores than did men with prostate cancer (reference group). Time from diagnosis to survey, cancer stage, number of cancers, and comorbidities were not significantly associated with care coordination scores.

Objective:   To describe our revised RARP technique (ie, superextended RARP [SE-RARP]) for PCa patients with posterior iT3a or iT3b at MRI.  Design, setting, and participants:   Data from 89 patients with posterior iT3a or T3b disease who underwent SE-RARP at a single high-volume centre between 2015 and 2018 were analysed.  Surgical procedure:   RARP was performed using a DaVinci Xi system. The surgical approach provided an inter- or extrafascial RARP where Denonvilliers' fascia and perirectal fat were dissected free and left on the posterior surface of the seminal vesicles.  Measurements:   Perioperative outcomes, and intra- and postoperative complications were assessed. Postoperative outcomes were assessed in patients with complete follow-up data (n = 78). Biochemical recurrence (BCR) was defined as two consecutive prostate-specific antigen values of ≥0.2 ng/ml. Urinary continence (UC) recovery was defined as the use of zero or one safety pad. Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression models were used.  Results and limitations:   The median operative time, blood loss, and length of stay were 204 min, 300 ml, and 5 d, respectively. The median bladder catheterisation time was 5 d. Overall, 28%, 28%, and 27% of patients had pathological grade group (GG) 4-5, pT3b, and positive surgical margins (PSMs), respectively. Three patients (3.4%) experienced intraoperative complications. Among patients with available follow-up data (n = 78), 14 (18%) experienced 30-d postoperative complications. The median follow-up was 19 mo. Overall, 11 patients received additional treatment. At 2 yr of follow-up, BCR-free and additional treatment-free survival were 55% and 66%, respectively. Pathological GG 4-5 (hazard ratio [HR] 3.2) and PSM (HR 5.8) were independent predictors of recurrence, as well as of additional treatment use (HR 5.6 for GG 4-5 and 5.2 for PSM). The 1-yr UC recovery was 84%.  Conclusions:   We presented our revised RARP technique applicable to patients with posterior iT3a or iT3b at preoperative MRI. This technique is associated with good morbidity and continence recovery rates, and might guarantee biochemical control of the disease and postpone the use of additional treatments in patients with low-grade and negative surgical margins.

The goal of this work was to determine how MRI contrast agents affect radiosensitivity for tumour cells. Using a 225kVp X-ray cabinet source, immunofluorescence and clonogenic assays were performed on six cancer cell lines: lung (H460), pancreas (MiaPaCa2), prostate (DU145), breast (MCF7), brain (U87) and liver (HEPG2). Dotarem® contrast agent, at concentrations of 0.2, 2 and 20 mM, was used to determine its effect on DNA damage and cell survival. Measurements were performed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to determine the amount of gadolinium taken up by each cell line for each concentration. A statistically significant increase in DNA damage was seen for all cell lines at a dose of 1 Gy for concentrations of 2 and 20 mM, at 1 h postirradiation. At 24 h postirradiation, most of the DNA damage had been repaired, with approximately 90% repair for almost all doses of radiation and concentrations of Dotarem. Clonogenic results showed no statistically significant decrease in cell survival for any cell line or concentration. Uptake measurements showed cell line-specific variations in uptake, with MCF7 and HEPG2 cells having a high percentage uptake compared to other cell lines, with 151.4 ± 0.3 × 10-15 g and 194.8 ± 0.4 × 10-15 g per cell, respectively, at 2 mM Dotarem concentration. In this work, a variability in gadolinium uptake was observed between cell lines. A significant increase was seen in initial levels of DNA damage after 1 Gy irradiation for all six cancer cell lines; however, no significant decrease in cell survival was seen with the clonogenic assay. The observation of high levels of repair suggest that while initial levels of DNA damage are increased, this damage is almost entirely repaired within 24 h, and does not affect the ability of cells to survive and produce colonies.""","""['Emily Russell', 'Stephen J McMahon', 'Ben Russell', 'Hibaaq Mohamud', 'Conor K McGarry', 'Giuseppe Schettino', 'Kevin M Prise']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Radiat Res""","""['Effects of motexafin gadolinium on DNA damage and X-ray-induced DNA damage repair, as assessed by the Comet assay.', 'Enhanced cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of gadolinium-doped ZnO nanoparticles on irradiated lung cancer cells at megavoltage radiation energies.', 'The in vitro effects of a bimodal contrast agent on cellular functions and relaxometry.', 'Relationships between clonogenic cell survival, DNA damage and chromosomal radiosensitivity in nine human cervix carcinoma cell lines.', 'Overview of radiosensitivity of human tumor cells to low-dose-rate irradiation.', 'Feasibility of cardiac-synchronized quantitative T1 and T2 mapping on a hybrid 1.5 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging and linear accelerator system.', 'The Effect of Magnetic Field Gradient and Gadolinium-Based MRI Contrast Agent Dotarem on Mouse Macrophages.', 'Impact of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles on in vitro and in vivo radiosensitisation of cancer cells.']"""

This study investigates stress and masculine identity threat as predictors of quality of life and emotional adjustment in men with localized prostate cancer and the role of resilience as a potential protective psychological factor.  Methods:   Participants were invited to complete a survey study via online prostate cancer forums. Participants were 204 men ranging in age from 44-88 years (M = 65.24±7.51) and who were diagnosed with early localized prostate cancer within the previous five years. Measures used included the Perceived Stress Scale, Cancer-Related Masculine Threat Scale and the Conor-Davidson Resilience Scale. Using a cross-sectional online survey design, the extent to which perceived stress, masculine threat and psychological resilience are associated with quality of life, positive and negative affect and distress was assessed.  Results:   Hierarchical regression analysis demonstrated that perceived stress accounted for 26%-44% of variance on quality of life and adjustment indices, with high stress associated with low mood and poor quality of life. Low masculine threat and high resilience predicted better quality of life and emotional adjustment accounting for between 1-7% of the variance. Resilience moderated the relationship between stress and distress and mediated the association between masculine threat and distress and negative affect.  Conclusion:   Perceived stress was the most powerful predictor in the model and findings suggest it contributes significantly to functional and affective status in survivors of prostate cancer. Psychological resilience is a protective factor which buffers the negative effect of stress and masculine identity threat on emotional adjustment. Findings indicate that men should be screened as part of the diagnostic and treatment process for high perceived stress and low resilience to identify those at risk for poor adjustment during survivorship.""","""['AnnMarie Groarke', 'Ruth Curtis', 'Jean Skelton', 'Jenny M Groarke']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Preliminary results of a randomised controlled trial of an online psychological intervention to reduce distress in men treated for localised prostate cancer.', 'Quality of life and psychological distress in cancer survivors: The role of psycho-social resources for resilience.', 'Investigating the role of psychological flexibility, masculine self-esteem and stoicism as predictors of psychological distress and quality of life in men living with prostate cancer.', 'How does active surveillance for prostate cancer affect quality of life?

In this UK-wide case-control study, we have explored the possible association of prostate cancer risk with male self-reported body size. We also investigated body shape as a surrogate marker for fat deposition around the body. As obesity and excessive adiposity have been linked with increased risk for developing a number of different cancers, further investigation of self-reported body size and shape and their potential relationship with prostate cancer was considered to be appropriate.  Objective:   The study objective was to investigate whether underlying associations exist between prostate cancer risk and male self-reported body size and shape.  Methods:   Data were collected from a large case-control study of men (1928 cases and 2043 controls) using self-administered questionnaires. Data from self-reported pictograms of perceived body size relating to three decades of life (20's, 30's and 40's) were recorded and analysed, including the pattern of change. The associations of self-identified body shape with prostate cancer risk were also explored.  Results:   Self-reported body size for men in their 20's, 30's and 40's did not appear to be associated with prostate cancer risk. More than half of the subjects reported an increase in self-reported body size throughout these three decades of life. Furthermore, no association was observed between self-reported body size changes and prostate cancer risk. Using 'symmetrical' body shape as a reference group, subjects with an 'apple' shape showed a significant 27% reduction in risk (Odds ratio = 0.73, 95% C.I. 0.57-0.92).  Conclusions:   Change in self-reported body size throughout early to mid-adulthood in males is not a significant risk factor for the development of prostate cancer. Body shape indicative of body fat distribution suggested that an 'apple' body shape was protective and inversely associated with prostate cancer risk when compared with 'symmetrical' shape. Further studies which investigate prostate cancer risk and possible relationships with genetic factors known to influence body shape may shed further light on any underlying associations.""","""['Mohammad Aladwani', 'Artitaya Lophatananon', 'Fredie Robinson', 'Aneela Rahman', 'William Ollier', 'Zsofia Kote-Jarai', 'David Dearnaley', 'Govindasami Koveela', 'Nafisa Hussain', 'Reshma Rageevakumar', 'Diana Keating', 'Andrea Osborne', 'Tokhir Dadaev', 'Mark Brook;British Association of Urological Surgeons’ Section of Oncology;Rosalind Eeles', 'Kenneth R Muir']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Use of genetic variation to separate the effects of early and later life adiposity on disease risk: mendelian randomisation study.', 'Body size across the life course and prostate cancer in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study.', 'Subcutaneous fat distribution of the abdomen and buttocks in Japanese women aged 20 to 58 years.', ""Systematic review of prostate cancer's association with body size in childhood and young adulthood."", 'Dietary Patterns and Breast, Colorectal, Lung, and Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review Internet.']"""

The use of biologic imaging such as Ga-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET-computed tomography (PET-CT) for this purpose is being explored in view of increased sensitivity of this modality and the associated ease of delineation.  Materials and methods:   The primary objective of the study was to compare the autogenerated volumes of the DIL in Ga-68 PSMA PET-CT with the standard volume delineated in mpMRI. Twenty patients with biopsy-proven untreated prostatic adenocarcinoma were included. Multiple percentages of the maximum standardized uptake value (%SUVmax) were used to autogenerate DIL volumes in Ga-68 PSMA PET-CT and these volumes were numerically matched with the consensus DIL volume in mpMRI. PSMA tumor volume (PSMA-TV) and total lesion PSMA (TL-PSMA) were also calculated for each lesion.  Results:   Median volume of DIL in mpMRI was 4 cm (interquartile range, IQR = 2.5-7.6 cm). The IQR for interobserver variability was 0.5-2.5 cm. Median SUVmax of the DIL was 14.1 (IQR = 10.2-22.3). Median %SUVmax corresponding to mpMRI volume was 41% of SUVmax (IQR = 34-55%). There was a strong negative correlation between MRI volume and %SUVmax (r = -0.829, P < 0.001). There was a significant correlation between TL-PSMA and prostate-specific antigen (r = 0.609, P = 0.004).  Conclusions:   The median DIL volume was 4 cm and median %SUVmax corresponding to MR volume of DIL was 41%. A strong inverse relationship is found between mpMRI-defined DIL volume and the %SUVmax which generates similar volume in Ga-68 PSMA PET-CT. TL-PSMA could be a quantitative biomarker for tumor load and prognosis.""","""['Ajay Sasidharan', 'Vedang Murthy', 'Aravintho Natarajan', 'Archi Agarwal', 'Venkatesh Ranagrajan', 'Suresh Gudi', 'Somesh Singh', 'Palak Popat']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Nucl Med Commun""","""['Combined Utility of 68Ga-Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography and Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Predicting Prostate Biopsy Pathology.', 'Incremental Impact of 68\xa0GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT in Primary N and M Staging of Prostate Cancer Prior to Curative-Intent Surgery: a Prospective Clinical Trial in Comparison with mpMRI.', 'Findings in 1,123 Men with Preoperative 68Ga-Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computerized Tomography and Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Compared to Totally Embedded Radical Prostatectomy Histopathology: Implications for the Diagnosis and Management of Prostate Cancer.', '68Ga-PSMA-PET: added value and future applications in comparison to the current use of choline-PET and mpMRI in the workup of prostate cancer.', 'Ga-68 Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen PET/CT: Imaging and Clinical Perspective in Prostate Cancer: Imaging and Clinical Perspective in Prostate Cancer.', 'Feasibility of biology-guided radiotherapy using PSMA-PET to boost to dominant intraprostatic tumour.']"""

The DPBN optimization was based on our earlier published formalism for prostate cancer that is driven by dose-responses of Gleason scores mapped from apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC).  Material and methods:   For 17 included patients, a set of DPBN plans were optimized in a TPS by maximizing the TCP for an equal average dose to the prostate volume (CTVT) as for a conventional uniform dose treatment. For the plan optimizations we applied different photon energies, different precisions for the ADC-to-Gleason mappings, and different CTVT positioning uncertainties. The TCP increasing potential was evaluated by the DPBN efficiency, defined as the ratio of TCP increases for DPBN plans by TCP increases for ideal DPBN prescriptions (optimized without considering radiation transport phenomena, uncertainties of the CTVT positioning, and uncertainties of the ADC-to-Gleason mapping).  Results:   The median DPBN efficiency for the most conservative planning scenario optimized with a low precision ADC-to-Gleason mapping, and a positioning uncertainty of 0.6 cm was 10%, meaning that more than half of the patients had a TCP gain of at least 10% of the TCP for an ideal DPBN prescription. By increasing the precision of the ADC-to-Gleason mapping, and decreasing the positioning uncertainty the median DPBN efficiency increased by up to 40%.  Conclusions:   TCP increases with DPBN plans optimized in a TPS were found more likely with a high precision mapping of image data into dose-responses and a high certainty of the tumor positioning. These findings motivate further development to ensure precise mappings of image data into dose-responses and to ensure a high spatial certainty of the tumor positioning when implementing DPBN clinically.""","""['Eric Grönlund', 'Erik Almhagen', 'Silvia Johansson', 'Erik Traneus', 'Tufve Nyholm', 'Camilla Thellenberg', 'Anders Ahnesjö']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Dose painting of prostate cancer based on Gleason score correlations with apparent diffusion coefficients.', 'Robust dose-painting-by-numbers vs. nonselective dose escalation for non-small cell lung cancer patients.', 'Repeatability of dose painting by numbers treatment planning in prostate cancer radiotherapy based on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Robust maximization of tumor control probability for radicality constrained radiotherapy dose painting by numbers of head and neck cancer.', 'Dose painting by numbers in a standard treatment planning system using inverted dose prescription maps.', 'Adaptive dose painting for prostate cancer.', 'Medical Imaging Biomarker Discovery and Integration Towards AI-Based Personalized Radiotherapy.']"""

The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between decision-making preferences among patients with prostate cancer and personal, disease-related, and structural factors. In four survey studies, we asked 7169 prostate cancer patients about their decision-making preferences using the Control Preferences Scale (CPS) and collected clinical, psychological, and quality-of-life measures. Most patients (62.2%) preferred collaborative decision-making, while 2322 (32.4%) preferred an active role, and only 391 (5.5%) preferred a passive role. Age (p < 0.001), data collection mode (p < 0.001), peer-to-peer support (p = 0.018), treatment status (p < 0.001), performed or planned radical prostatectomy (p < 0.001), metastatic disease (p = 0.001), and quality of life (p < 0.001) showed significant associations with patients' preferred decision-making roles. Oncologic risk group, anxiety, and depression were not significant in the model. In particular, younger prostate cancer patients with higher quality of life completing an online survey want to play a more active role in treatment decision-making. Before treatment has started, patients tend to prefer collaborative decision-making. Few prostate cancer patients in Germany prefer a passive role. These patients are mostly older patients, patients with a metastatic disease, and patients who have opted for prostatectomy. Whether this finding reflects a generational effect or a tendency by age group and disease phase should be investigated. Further research is also needed to describe the causalities of these relationships. The CPS offers valuable information for personal counselling and should be applied in clinical routine. In a large group of patients with prostate cancer, we found that there is a strong desire for joint decision-making with the physician before the actual treatment. Especially younger men, men with active online behaviour, and men with a high quality of life want to be actively involved in therapy decision-making processes.""","""['Andreas Ihrig', 'I Maatouk', 'H C Friederich', 'M Baunacke', 'C Groeben', 'R Koch', 'C Thomas', 'J Huber']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Cancer Educ""","""['Preferred and perceived participation roles of oncological patients in medical decision-making: Results of a survey among users of the German Cancer Information Service.', 'Information and decision-making preferences of men with prostate cancer.', 'Factors Affecting Satisfaction with the Decision-Making Process and Decision Regret for Men with a New Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'Preferred and actual participation roles during health care decision making in persons with cancer: a systematic review.', 'Patient decision aids for prostate cancer treatment: a systematic review of the literature.', 'Decisional conflict and its determinants among patients with cancer undergoing immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy or targeted therapy: a cross-sectional study.', 'Decision-Making Preferences among Advanced Cancer Patients in a Palliative Setting in Jordan.', 'Couples coping with advanced prostate cancer: an explorative study on decision-making preferences, self-efficacy and fear of progression.', 'Understanding what matters to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients when considering treatment options: A US patient preference survey.', 'Improving access to oncology publications for advocates and people with cancer.']"""

Objective:   To examine whether Black and White men with prostate cancer differ in their willingness to discuss clinical trials with their physicians and, if so, whether patient-level barriers statistically mediate racial differences.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cross-sectional survey study used baseline data from Partnering Around Cancer Clinical Trials, a randomized clinical trial to increase Black individuals' enrollment in prostate cancer clinical trials. Data were collected from 2016 through 2019 at 2 National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer centers; participants were Black and White men with intermediate-risk to high-risk prostate cancer. In mediation analysis, path models regressed willingness onto race and each potential mediator, simultaneously including direct paths from race to each mediator. Significant indirect effect sizes served as evidence for mediation.  Exposures:   Race was the primary exposure. Potential mediators included age, education, household income, perceived economic burden, pain/physical limitation, health literacy, general trust in physicians, and group-based medical suspicion.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcome was the answer to a single question: ""If you were offered a cancer clinical trial, would you be willing to hear more information about it?""  Results:   A total of 205 participants were included (92 Black men and 113 White men), with a mean (range) age of 65.7 (45-89) years; 32% had a high school education or lower, and 27.5% had a household income of less than $40 000. Most (88.3%) reported being definitely or probably willing to discuss trials, but White participants were more likely to endorse this highest category of willingness than Black participants (82% vs 64%; χ22 = 8.81; P = .01). Compared with White participants, Black participants were younger (F1,182 = 8.67; P < .001), less educated (F1,182 = 22.79; P < .001), with lower income (F1,182 = 79.59; P < .001), greater perceived economic burden (F1,182 = 42.46; P < .001), lower health literacy (F1,184 = 9.84; P = .002), and greater group-based medical suspicion (F1,184 = 21.48; P < .001). Only group-based medical suspicion significantly mediated the association between race and willingness to discuss trials (indirect effect, -0.22; P = .002).  Conclusions and relevance:   In this study of men with prostate cancer, most participants were willing to discuss trials, but Black men were significantly less willing than White men. Black men were more likely to believe that members of their racial group should be suspicious of the health care system, and this belief was associated with lower willingness to discuss trials.

Materials and Methods: We described some critical changes in our routine to minimize the COVID infection among patients and health care workers. From March 1 to May 25, 2020, we described our actions and surgical outcomes of patients treated in our center during the pandemic. Results: Preventing hospital visits, we implemented some modifications in our office routine in terms of patient appointment, follow-up, and management of nonsurgical candidates. In this period, 147 patients underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) without intraoperative complications. The median operative time and blood loss were 91 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] = 25) and 50 mL (IQR = 50), respectively. The median hospitalization time was 15.8 hours (IQR = 2.5). None of the patients of our study had COVID in the postoperative follow-up, and only two patients were rescheduled due to a positive rapid COVID test 1 day before surgery. The final pathology described 10 patients (6.8%) Grade Group (GrGp) 1, 34 (23.1%) GrGp 2, 31 (21%) GrGp 3, 16 (10.8%) GrGp 4, 37 (25.3%) GrGp 5, and 19 (13%) with deferred Gleason. Two patients, COVID negative, were readmitted due to infected lymphocele managed with antibiotic and Interventional Radiology drainage. Conclusion: Our experience managing patients with prostate cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic showed that changing the office routine, stratifying the patients according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk, and adopting COVID-based criteria to select patients for surgery are necessary actions to maintain the best quality of treatment and minimize the viral infection among our oncological patients.

Methods: We reviewed 40 patients with carcinoma in situ-free nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer undergoing PDD-TURBT. Of 40 patients, 12 underwent photodynamic diagnosis-assisted en bloc transurethral resection of bladder tumor (PDD-EBTUR) and 28 underwent PDD-assisted conventional TURBT (cTURBT). Two groups were matched in terms of clinicopathologic background and did not include patients treated with intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin. The assessment of postoperative quality of life (QoL) was based on patient-reported outcome measure, including the International Prostate Symptom Score, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bladder (FACT-BL), and 8-item Short Form (SF-8™) questionnaires before and 1 month after TUR. This study was approved by the Ethics commitee and all participants provided informed consent. Results: PDD guidance provided substantial help for circumferent demarcation around the bladder tumor, which precedes tumor dissection. One female patient (12%) treated by PDD-EBTUR had grade II bladder perforation requiring prolonged catheterization. Pathologic assessment of horizontal and vertical margins in resected specimens by PDD-EBTUR revealed that all specimens had muscularis propria, and the rate of en bloc resection was 100%. No patient had intravesical recurrence in the PDD-EBTUR group (median follow-up, 11 months), while two patients in the PDD-cTURBT group had Ta low-grade recurrent tumors (8 months). Postoperatively, scores of daytime frequency and nocturia were increased in both groups. QoL assessment using the FACT-BL and SF-8 revealed that postoperative deterioration of bladder-specific subscale and emotional/mental scores was found in the EBTUR group but not in the cTURBT group.

Tracking longitudinal biomarkers as a way to identify early disease onset may help to reduce mortality from diseases like ovarian cancer that are more treatable if detected early. Two disease risk prediction frameworks, the shared random effects model (SREM) and the pattern mixture model (PMM) could be used to assess longitudinal biomarkers on disease early detection. In this article, we studied the discrimination and calibration performances of SREM and PMM on disease early detection through an application to ovarian cancer, where early detection using the risk of ovarian cancer algorithm (ROCA) has been evaluated. Comparisons of the above three approaches were performed via analyses of the ovarian cancer data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Discrimination was evaluated by the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve and its area, while calibration was assessed using calibration plot and the ratio of observed to expected number of diseased subjects. The out-of-sample performances were calculated via using leave-one-out cross-validation, aiming to minimize potential model overfitting. A careful analysis of using the biomarker cancer antigen 125 for ovarian cancer early detection showed significantly improved discrimination performance of PMM as compared with SREM and ROCA, nevertheless all approaches were generally well calibrated. Robustness of all approaches was further investigated in extensive simulation studies. The improved performance of PMM relative to ROCA is in part due to the fact that the biomarker measurements were taken at a yearly interval, which is not frequent enough to reliably estimate the changepoint or the slope after changepoint in cases under ROCA.""","""['Yongli Han', 'Paul S Albert', 'Christine D Berg', 'Nicolas Wentzensen', 'Hormuzd A Katki', 'Danping Liu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Stat Med""","""['Risk Algorithm Using Serial Biomarker Measurements Doubles the Number of Screen-Detected Cancers Compared With a Single-Threshold Rule in the United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening.', 'Development of a longitudinal two-biomarker algorithm for early detection of ovarian cancer in women with BRCA mutations.', 'Potential effect of the risk of ovarian cancer algorithm (ROCA) on the mortality outcome of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) trial.', 'Screening for Ovarian Cancer: Updated Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force.', 'Ovarian Cancer Biomarkers: Moving Forward in Early Detection.', 'A multivariate parametric empirical Bayes screening approach for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma using multiple longitudinal biomarkers.', 'Time-varying discrimination accuracy of longitudinal biomarkers for the prediction of mortality compared to assessment at fixed time point in severe burns patients.']"""

These studies have revealed that tumour cells exhibit a dynamic metabolic plasticity, using numerous pathways including both glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to support cell proliferation, energy production and the synthesis of biomass. These advanced technologies have also demonstrated metabolic differences between cancer cell types, between molecular subtypes within cancers and between cell states. This has been exemplified by examining the transitions of cancer cells between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes, referred to as epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP). A growing number of studies are demonstrating significant metabolic alterations associated with these transitions, such as increased use of glycolysis by triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) or glutamine addiction in lung cancer. Models of EMP, including invasive cell lines and xenografts, isolated circulating tumour cells and metastatic tissue have been used to examine EMP metabolism. Understanding the metabolism supporting molecular and cellular plasticity and increased metastatic capacity may reveal metabolic vulnerabilities that can be therapeutically exploited. This chapter describes protocols for using the Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer (XFe96), which simultaneously performs real-time monitoring of oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis in living cells. As an example, we compare the metabolic profiles generated from two breast cancer sublines that reflect epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes, respectively. We use this example to show how the methodology described can generate bioenergetic results that in turn can be correlated to EMP phenotypes. Normalisation of bioenergetic studies should be considered with respect to cell number, and to potential differences in mitochondrial mass, itself being an important bioenergetics endpoint.""","""['Sugandha Bhatia', 'Erik W Thompson', 'Jennifer H Gunter']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Methods Mol Biol""","""['Bioenergetic analysis of intact mammalian cells using the Seahorse XF24 Extracellular Flux analyzer and a luciferase ATP assay.', 'Characterization of the role Rab25 in energy metabolism and cancer using extracellular flux analysis and material balance.', 'Extracellular Flux Assays to Determine Oxidative Phosphorylation and Glycolysis in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Cells.', 'The pathways related to glutamine metabolism, glutamine inhibitors and their implication for improving the efficiency of chemotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Metabolic reprogramming in triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Optical imaging detects metabolic signatures associated with oocyte quality†.']"""

To overcome this knowledge gap, we benchmarked hospital-level quality (n = 1245 hospitals) across a broad multidisciplinary panel of previously reported disease-specific, expert-defined quality indicators (QIs), adjusting for differences in patient case mix by indirect standardization. A composite measure of prostate cancer quality-the prostate cancer quality score (PC-QS)-was derived, and associations between PC-QS and hospital volume, academic status, and location as well as patient all-cause mortality were determined. After adjusting for the case mix, of the total of 1245 hospitals evaluated, 2-37% were identified as those performing significantly below the national average for a given QI. Hospitals with a higher PC-QS displayed larger patient volumes, were more commonly academic affiliated, and had lower overall mortality. Collectively, our data-driven benchmarking analysis reveals that widespread hospital-level variations exist in prostate cancer quality of care after adjusting for differences in case mix, with the PC-QS serving as a novel, validated, quality benchmarking tool.

However, the functions of IMP3 and the underlying mechanisms in prostate cancer still remain unknown. Therefore, the current study was carried out to reveal the role and molecular mechanism of IMP3 in prostate cancer progression.  Methods:   The expression levels of IMP3 in prostate cancer tissues and cells were detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blotting and RT-PCR. CCK-8, clone formation, flow cytometry and in vivo tumor formation assays were used to determine cell growth, clone formation apoptosis and tumorigenesis, respectively. The effect of IMP3 on the expression levels of the key proteins in PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, including PIP2, PIP3, p-AKT, AKT, p-mTOR, mTOR, PTEN and BAD activation of was determined by western blotting. IP (Immunoprecipitation) assay was used to evaluate the effects of IMP3 and SMURF1 (SMAD specific E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1) on the ubiquitination of PTEN protein.  Results:   IMP3 expression level was significantly increased in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines (LNCap, PC3 and DU145) as compared with the paracancerous normal tissues and cells (RWPE-1), respectively. High expression of IMP3 apparently promoted cell viability, tumorigenesis and inhibited cell apoptosis in prostate cancer LNCap, DU145 and PC3 cell lines. In mechanism, IMP3 upregulation significantly increased the phosphorylation levels of AKT and mTOR, and elevated PIP3 expression level, while induced significant reductions in the expression levels of BAD, PTEN and PIP2. And, IMP3 overexpression increased SMURF1 expression, which facilitated PTEN ubiquitination. In addition, SMURF1 overexpression enhanced prostate cancer cell viability and inhibited cell apoptosis. Silence of SMURF1 rescued the enhancements in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis and the inhibition in cell apoptosis rates induced by IMP3 in prostate cancer DU145 and LNCap cells.  Conclusion:   This study reveals that IMP3 is overdressed in prostate cancer, which accelerates the progression of prostate cancer through activating PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway via increasing SMURF1-mediated PTEN ubiquitination.""","""['Xiang Zhang#', 'Dawei Wang#', 'Boke Liu#', 'Xingwei Jin', 'Xianjin Wang', 'Junwei Pan', 'Weichao Tu', 'Yuan Shao']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['Retraction Note: IMP3 accelerates the progression of prostate cancer through inhibiting PTEN expression in a SMURF1-dependent way.', 'Depletion of SAG/RBX2 E3 ubiquitin ligase suppresses prostate tumorigenesis via inactivation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis.', 'LncRNA SNHG3 sponges miR-577 to up-regulate SMURF1 expression in prostate cancer.', 'Oncogenic Smurf1 promotes PTEN wild-type glioblastoma growth by mediating PTEN ubiquitylation.', 'The HECT family of E3 ubiquitin ligases and PTEN.', 'The equilibrium of tumor suppression: DUBs as active regulators of PTEN.', 'Spatially resolved transcriptomics revealed local invasion-related genes in colorectal cancer.', 'PRLR and CACNA2D1 Impact the Prognosis of Breast Cancer by Regulating Tumor Immunity.', 'Smurf1 Suppression Enhances Temozolomide Chemosensitivity in Glioblastoma by Facilitating PTEN Nuclear Translocation.', 'Functions and mechanisms of N6‑methyladenosine in prostate cancer (Review).', 'Functional roles of E3 ubiquitin ligases in prostate cancer.']"""

Here, we examine possible explanatory variables of mental distress in a population-based cohort of men who have undergone radical prostatectomy (RP). Data were derived from a Maritimes-Canada online survey assessing patient-reported quality of life outcomes between 2017 and 2019 administered to 136 men (47-88 years old, currently in a relationship) who have undergone RP for their PCa diagnosis. The primary outcome was a validated assessment of mental distress, the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Urinary function was assessed using the International Prostate Symptom Score, and relationship satisfaction was assessed using the Dyadic Assessment Scale. A multivariate logistic regression assessed the contribution of urinary function, relationship satisfaction, age, multimorbidity, additional treatments, medication for depression and/or anxiety, and survivorship time. A total of 16.2% men in this sample screened positive for mental distress. The severity of urinary problems was positively associated with increased mental distress (OR = 4.79, 95% CI [1.04, 22.03]), while increased age (OR = 0.87, 95% CI [0.78, 0.97]), relationship satisfaction (OR = 0.14, 95% CI [0.3, .077]), and current medication for anxiety, depression, or both (OR = 0.09, 95% CI [0.02, 0.62]) were protective factors.

No cases showed associated Müllerian structures. One case showed separate foci of nephrogenic adenoma at diagnosis, and 1 case showed urothelial carcinoma in situ on a later follow-up biopsy. Four tumors extended into other organs (prostate to seminal vesicle and periprostatic soft tissue, periprostatic soft tissue to prostate, prostatic urethra to bladder and rectum, and prostate to bladder neck). One tumor showed extraprostatic extension alone. Four tumors metastasized to lymph nodes, with 3 also metastasizing to other sites (bladder, lung and adrenal, and right flank). Eleven patients underwent resection, including 3 transurethral resections. Seven underwent other treatments, including radiation (5 [1 for recurrence]), chemotherapy (3), hormonal therapy (3), immunotherapy with nivolumab (1), and targeted therapy with gefitinib (1). The mean follow-up was 35 months (range: 1 to 138 mo). At the last follow-up, 7 patients showed no evident disease and 3 were alive with disease. Four died with the cause of death unknown, with 2 cases having confirmed disease at the time of death and the remaining 2 dying less than a year after diagnosis.

Ranking among one of the top three forms of cancer, it is unfortunate that prostate cancer screening is not routinely recommended. This study attempts to explore the barriers to prostate cancer screening among Indo-Guyanese men. We conducted in-depth, one on one interviews among 20 Indo-Guyanese men between the ages of 45 and 75 years old, residing in the New York City neighborhood of Queens. Qualitative analysis was performed using multiple coders. Detailed analysis of the data found four major themes to be the culprit associated with a decrease in prostate cancer screening in this population: (1) lack of knowledge about the disease, (2) fear of diagnosis, (3) embarrassment and, (4) personal reservations with the rectal exam. The findings of this research suggest that Indo-Guyanese immigrants are lacking the basic understanding of prostate cancer and the importance of screening. It is possible that this deficiency is also applicable to many other disease states. By collaborating with healthcare providers and other stakeholders, such as community leaders and elected officials, we can develop culturally appropriate services specific to this population, to address these barriers to healthcare services.""","""['Harrynauth Persaud', 'Jeanetta Yuan', 'Aimee Afable', 'Denise M Bruno']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Community Health""","""['Prostate cancer screening behaviors among Indo-Guyanese.', 'Factors associated with prostate cancer screening among Indo-Guyanese men.', 'High prevalence of diabetes among Indo-Guyanese adults, Schenectady, New York.', 'Factors associated with cervical cancer screening participation among migrant women in Europe: a scoping review.', 'Screening for prostate cancer.']"""

We have previously shown that CA could interfere with myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), leading to cancer growth inhibition. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promote cancer development in different ways. However, the effect of CA in CAFs has not been studied. In this study, we investigated the effect and mechanism of action of CA in prostate CAFs. We found that CA induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in prostate CAFs via the intrinsic pathway. This was due to the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Mψ), increased level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and calcium ion (Ca2+). In addition, protein expression analysis showed an increase in the expression levels of cytochrome c, bax, cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved PARP, and a decrease in the expression levels of Bcl-2, caspase 9, PARP, and DEF-45. Interestingly, reduced glutathione (GSH) rescued CAFs from CA-induced cell apoptosis, demonstrating that generation of ROS is critical for this effect.

Copper in blood is mainly transported by carrier proteins but a small fraction is bound to low molecular weight species, possibly amino acids. Their roles in cellular copper delivery are unknown. Our aim was to test whether accumulation of 64Cu into cancer-derived cells can be influenced by copper-binding serum amino acids. In vitro cellular accumulation of 64Cu was measured in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution in the presence of 100 μM l-histidine, l-methionine, l-cysteine and l-threonine. l-Cysteine markedly increased 64Cu accumulation and retention in DU145, PC3 and SK-OV-3 cells, while some other cell lines did not show an effect. This effect was not due to 64Cu delivery in the form of a 64Cu-cysteine complex, nor to reduction of 64Cu(ii) to 64Cu(i) by l-cysteine. Pre-incubation of cells with l-cysteine increased 64Cu accumulation, even if l-cysteine was removed from HBSS before 64Cu was added. The effect of l-cysteine on 64Cu accumulation was not mediated by increased glutathione synthesis. Despite the demonstrable in vitro effect, pre-injection of l-cysteine precursor N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) in vivo did not enhance 64Cu delivery to DU145 xenografts in mice. Instead, it decreased 64Cu accumulation in the DU145 tumour and in brain, as assessed by PET imaging. We conclude that 64Cu is not delivered to DU145 cancer cells in vitro as a complex with amino acids but its cellular accumulation is enhanced by l-cysteine or NAC influx to cells.

Results:   A significant dose-dependent cytotoxic impact of LSEO-NE was detected in the A2780 cells and not in HFF cellsThe apoptotic genes expression profile confirmed the A2780 cell apoptosis death. Moreover, the reduction in length and number of blood vessels in the CAM assay demonstrated the anti-angiogenic activity of LSEO-NE.

Methods:   Electronic search analysis pertaining to Hodgkin's lymphoma, leukemia, breast, colorectal, and thyroid cancer were carried out from two databases: The Saudi Cancer Registry (SCR) and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER). Data on prevalence and incident frequency were collected. Trends from 2001 to 2014 were calculated and compared between SCR and SEER.  Findings:   Leukemia is the most common cancer type among males in SA, followed by colorectal cancer. Hodgkin's lymphoma has become the third most common malignancy among Saudi males. Percentage of women's breast cancer and thyroid cancer among total cancer cases have increased by 10.5% and 1.7% respectively from 2001 to 2014, making them the first and second most common cancers in women respectively. Trends of thyroid cancer among males has been stable. Colorectal cancer stands as third most common among Saudi females.  Interpretations:   There have been significant changes in trends of incidence rate of the most common cancers in SA among both males and females over the past decade.

Objective:   To investigate the concordance of PSMA PET/CT with conventional imaging (CI) with cross-sectional abdominopelvic and/or radionuclide bone imaging in the initial staging of patients with treatment-naïve PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   We performed a post hoc retrospective cohort study of patients enrolled in a prospective single-arm trial (NCT03368547). We included patients with intermediate-risk (IR) and high-risk (HR) PCa who underwent PSMA PET/CT within 6 mo of CI. Patients with any treatment prior to PSMA PET/CT were excluded. Patient- and tumor-specific data, and imaging findings were obtained.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Our primary outcome measurement was the concordance rate of PSMA PET/CT with CI for the identification of N, M1a, M1b, and M1c disease. Descriptive statistics were used.  Results and limitations:   A total of 168 patients with treatment-naïve IR and HR PCa met the inclusion criteria. HR disease accounted for 124/168 (73.8%) patients. The median prostate-specific antigen was 11.4 (6.8-24.6)ng/ml. The rates of nonconcordance between PSMA PET/CT and CI were 34/162 (21.0%), 5/70 (7.1%), 8/92 (8.7%), and 1/71 (1.4%) for N, M1a, M1b, and M1c disease, respectively. PSMA PET/CT assigned a higher stage in 37/168 (22.0%) patients and a lower stage in 12/170 (7.1%) patients. In a subset of 50 patients treated with radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection, the prevalence of PSMA PET/CT-positive and that of CI-positive nodal disease were 14% and 4%, and the false negative rates were 30% and 32%, respectively. The principal limitations of this study include the heterogeneity in CI modalities and the 6-mo time frame between CI and PSMA PET.  Conclusions:   PSMA PET/CT imaging may serve as a valuable tool in the initial staging of treatment-naïve IR and HR PCa.  Patient summary:   We evaluated how prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) compared with standard imaging (such as computed tomography, bone scan, and prostate magnetic resonance imaging) for initial staging of patients with prostate cancer.

Current screening-guidelines suggest the use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) only among BRCA2 carriers. Female carriers have extensive guidelines that include imaging. Our objective was to test the prevalence of PCa among BRCA carriers and examine screening strategies, using PSA and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI).  Patients and methods:   We recruited men aged 40-70 years with BRCA1/2 germline mutations and no prior history of prostate biopsy. All men underwent an initial round of screening which included PSA, and prostate mpMRI. PSA was considered elevated using an age-stratified threshold of ≥1 ng/ml for 40-50 years of age, ≥2 ng/ml for 50-60 years of age, and 2.5 ng/ml for 60-70 years of age. Men with elevated PSA and/or suspicious lesion on mpMRI were offered a prostate biopsy. PSA levels, MRI findings, PCa incidence, and tumor characteristics were evaluated. Decision curve analysis was used to compare screening strategies.  Results:   We recruited 188 men (108 BRCA1, 80 BRCA2), mean age 54 years (9.8). One hundred and ten (57%) had either elevated age-stratified PSA (75; 40%), a suspicious MRI lesion (67; 36%), or both (32; 17%). Of these, 92 (85%) agreed to perform a prostate biopsy. Sixteen (8.5%) were diagnosed with PCa; 44% of the tumors were classified as intermediate- or high-risk disease. mpMRI-based screening missed only one of the cancers (6%), while age-stratified PSA would have missed five (31%). Decision curve analysis showed that mpMRI screening, regardless of PSA, had the highest net benefit for PCa diagnosis, especially among men younger than 55 years of age. We found no difference in the risk of PCa between BRCA1 and BRCA2 (8.3% versus 8.7%, P = 0.91). Ninety percent had a Jewish founder mutation, thus the results cannot be generalized to all ethnic groups.  Conclusions:   PCa is prevalent among BRCA carriers.

Yet, it is not established whether combined SVI and EPE impart a worse prognosis compared to SVI alone. We studied a cohort of 69 prostatectomy patients with SVI with or without EPE. Patient age at the time of radical prostatectomy was documented and Gleason score and presence or absence of EPE and/or SVI were determined. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) was defined as a PSA rise >0.2 ng/mL. The frequency of BCR was 33.9% in cases with combined EPE and SVI versus 12.5% in cases with SVI alone (relative risk = 2.71). An additional cohort of 88 patients also showed a higher frequency of lymph node metastasis of 29% in patients with combined SVI and EPE at the time of radical prostatectomy versus a 10% frequency of lymph node metastasis in patients with SVI alone (relative risk = 2.9). Based on our data, we propose further subdividing pT3 prostate cancers into three groups: EPE alone (pT3a), SVI alone (pT3b), and combined EPE and SVI (pT3c).

However, PDT is limited to superficial, thin (few mm in depth) lesions that can be accessed by visible wavelength light. Interstitial light-delivery strategies have been developed to treat deep-seated lesions (i.e. prostate cancer). The most promising of these are X-ray-induced scintillation nanoparticles, which have shown potential benefits for PDT of deep-seated tumors. Herein, the design and use of a new nanoscintillator-based radiation-activated PDT (radioPDT) system is investigated in the treatment of deep-seated tumors. Poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether-block-poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PEG-PLGA) nanospheres were loaded with a scintillator (LaF3:Ce3+) and photosensitizer (PPIX) to effect radioPDT. UV-Vis spectroscopy and electron microscopy studies demonstrated efficient encapsulation of nanoscintillators and PPIX (>90% efficiency) into the PEG-PLGA nanospheres. The nanoparticles were uniform in size and approximately 100 nm in diameter. They were highly stable and functional for up to 24 h under physiological conditions and demonstrated slow release kinetics. In vitro and in vivo toxicity studies showed no appreciable drug toxicity to human skin fibroblast (GM38), prostate cancer cells (PC3), and to C57/BL mice. Cell uptake studies demonstrated accumulation of the nanoparticles in the cytoplasm of PC3 cells. When activated, fluorescent resonant energy transfer (FRET) was evident via fluorescent spectroscopy and singlet oxygen yield. Determination of stability revealed that the nanoparticles were stable for up to 4 weeks. The nanoparticle production was scaled-up with no change in properties.

The rates of CS disease detection by TP-TBx and TR-TBx were 59% and 54%, respectively. In a multivariate analysis adjusting for PSA, previous biopsy status, prostate volume, PI-RADS score, lesion volume, and lesion location, there was no statistically significant difference in likelihood to detect any PCa (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.56-1.71; P = .940) or CS PCa (OR, 0.94, 95% CI, 0.58-1.51; P = .791).

We sought to better understand the frequency of high-risk cases that appear suddenly in a screened population.  Methods:   We utilized data from a Commercial and Medicare advantage claims database to identify all US men ages 50 and above undergoing PSA screening who then had a sudden interval rise in PSA (e.g., PSA ≥ 20) and diagnosis of PC. We determined associations with age, race, screening intensity, and baseline PSA levels.  Results:   In all, 526,120 men met entry criteria with an average age of 60.7 and follow-up of 5.6 years. As the baseline PSA increased, the rate of high-risk PC increased from 2/10,000 persons among men with the lowest baseline PSA (<1 ng/ml) to 14/10,000 person-years among men with a baseline PSA < 5 ng/ml. Moreover, as a man's age at baseline PSA increased, the rate of high-risk PC also increased. In contrast, the incidence of high-risk PC did not vary significantly by race/ethnicity. More screening PSAs and shorter intervals between PSA screenings were associated with a lower incidence of high-risk PC.  Conclusions:   The incidence of high-risk PC in a screened population is low (<0.1%). Our findings suggest that systematic screening cannot eliminate all PC deaths and provide an estimate for the risk of the rapid development of high-risk cancers that is comparable to that observed in active surveillance populations.""","""['Fernandino L Vilson', 'Shufeng Li', 'James D Brooks', 'Michael L Eisenberg']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['The Finnish prostate cancer screening trial: analyses on the screening failures.', 'Prostate cancer screening practices in a large, integrated health system: 2007-2014.', 'Impact of Prostatic-specific Antigen Threshold and Screening Interval in Prostate Cancer Screening Outcomes: Comparing the Swedish and Finnish European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer Centres.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA)-Based Population Screening for Prostate Cancer: An Evidence-Based Analysis.', 'Population screening for prostate cancer and emerging concepts for young men.']"""

Unfortunately, the unclear organ boundary and large shape variation make the segmentation task very challenging. Previous studies usually used representations defined directly on unclear boundaries as context information to guide segmentation. Those boundary representations may not be so discriminative, resulting in limited performance improvement. To this end, we propose a novel boundary coding network (BCnet) to learn a discriminative representation for organ boundary and use it as the context information to guide the segmentation. Specifically, we design a two-stage learning strategy in the proposed BCnet: 1) Boundary coding representation learning. Two sub-networks under the supervision of the dilation and erosion masks transformed from the manually delineated organ mask are first separately trained to learn the spatial-semantic context near the organ boundary. Then we encode the organ boundary based on the predictions of these two sub-networks and design a multi-atlas based refinement strategy by transferring the knowledge from training data to inference. 2) Organ segmentation. The boundary coding representation as context information, in addition to the image patches, are used to train the final segmentation network. Experimental results on a large and diverse male pelvic CT dataset show that our method achieves superior performance compared with several state-of-the-art methods.""","""['Shuai Wang', 'Mingxia Liu', 'Jun Lian', 'Dinggang Shen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Med Imaging""","""['CT male pelvic organ segmentation using fully convolutional networks with boundary sensitive representation.', 'Locally-constrained boundary regression for segmentation of prostate and rectum in the planning CT images.', 'Pelvic Organ Segmentation Using Distinctive Curve Guided Fully Convolutional Networks.', 'Accurate Segmentation of CT Male Pelvic Organs via Regression-Based Deformable Models and Multi-Task Random Forests.', 'Synthetic MRI-aided multi-organ segmentation on male pelvic CT using cycle consistent deep attention network.']"""

According to the PRECISE recommendations, the index lesion size can be reported using different definitions of volume (planimetry or ellipsoid formula) or by measuring one or two diameters. We compared different measurements using planimetry as the reference standard and stratified changes according to the PRECISE scores.  Methods:   We retrospectively analysed 196 patients on AS with PCa confirmed by targeted biopsy who had two MR scans (baseline and follow-up). Lesions were measured on T2 weighted imaging (T2WI) according to all definitions. A PRECISE score was assessed for each patient.  Results:   The ellipsoid formula exhibited the highest correlation with planimetry at baseline (ρ = 0.97) and follow-up (ρ = 0.98) imaging, compared to the biaxial measurement and single maximum diameter. There was a significant difference (p < 0.001) in the yearly percentage volume change between radiological regression/stability (PRECISE 2-3) and progression (PRECISE 4-5) for planimetry (39.64%) and for the ellipsoid formula (46.78%).

Its functionality is evident in detecting bone metastasis in patients with malignant tumor including prostate cancer, as appropriate treatment and prognosis are dependent on the presence and degree of bone metastasis. The development of a deep learning-based algorithm in the field of information processing has been remarkable in recent years. We hypothesized that a deep learning-based algorithm is useful in diagnosing osseous metastases in patients with prostate cancer using bone scintigraphy. Thus, this study aims to examine the utility of deep learning-based algorithm in detecting bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer, as compared with nuclear medicine specialists.  Methods:   In total, 139 serial patients with prostate cancer, who underwent whole-body bone scintigraphy, were enrolled in this study. Each scintigraphy examination was evaluated visually and independently by nuclear medicine specialists; this was also analyzed using a deep learning-based algorithm. The number of abnormal uptakes was assessed by the nuclear medicine specialists and with a software which used the deep learning-based algorithm, and the per-patient detection rate and the per-region detection rate were then calculated. The software automatically analyzed bone scintigraphy for the presence or absence of osseous metastasis in individual patients, for the 12 body regions. The detection rates analyzed separately by the nuclear medicine specialists and using the software were then compared. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy by the specialist and with the software were calculated.  Results:   The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy by the nuclear medicine specialists were 100%, 94.9% and 97.1%. On the other hand, they with the software were 91.7%, 87.3% and 89.2%. No statistically significant difference was determined between the per-patient detection rates assessed by the specialists versus the software. In regional assessment, there was also no statistically significant difference between most of the per-region detection rates (10 of 12 regions) by the specialists versus the results obtained by the software.  Conclusions:   The software with the deep learning-based algorithm might be used as diagnostic aid in the evaluation of bone metastases for prostate cancer patients.""","""['Yuki Aoki', 'Michihiro Nakayama', 'Kenta Nomura', 'Yui Tomita', 'Kaori Nakajima', 'Masaaki Yamashina', 'Atsutaka Okizaki']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Ann Nucl Med""","""['Detection of bone metastasis of prostate cancer - comparison of whole-body MRI and bone scintigraphy.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Development of Convolutional Neural Networks to identify bone metastasis for prostate cancer patients in bone scintigraphy.', 'Prostatic specific antigen and bone scan in the diagnosis and follow-up of prostate cancer.

The results of the final analysis of overall survival have not yet been reported.  Methods:   In an open-label, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients in a 2:1 ratio to receive olaparib (256 patients) or the physician's choice of enzalutamide or abiraterone plus prednisone as the control therapy (131 patients). Cohort A included 245 patients with at least one alteration in BRCA1, BRCA2, or ATM, and cohort B included 142 patients with at least one alteration in any of the other 12 prespecified genes. Crossover to olaparib was allowed after imaging-based disease progression for patients who met certain criteria. Overall survival in cohort A, a key secondary end point, was analyzed with the use of an alpha-controlled, stratified log-rank test at a data maturity of approximately 60%. The primary and other key secondary end points were reported previously.  Results:   The median duration of overall survival in cohort A was 19.1 months with olaparib and 14.7 months with control therapy (hazard ratio for death, 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50 to 0.97; P = 0.02). In cohort B, the median duration of overall survival was 14.1 months with olaparib and 11.5 months with control therapy. In the overall population (cohorts A and B), the corresponding durations were 17.3 months and 14.0 months. Overall, 86 of 131 patients (66%) in the control group crossed over to receive olaparib (56 of 83 patients [67%] in cohort A). A sensitivity analysis that adjusted for crossover to olaparib showed hazard ratios for death of 0.42 (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.91) in cohort A, 0.83 (95% CI, 0.11 to 5.98) in cohort B, and 0.55 (95% CI, 0.29 to 1.06) in the overall population.  Conclusions:   Among men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had tumors with at least one alteration in BRCA1, BRCA2, or ATM and whose disease had progressed during previous treatment with a next-generation hormonal agent, those who were initially assigned to receive olaparib had a significantly longer duration of overall survival than those who were assigned to receive enzalutamide or abiraterone plus prednisone as the control therapy, despite substantial crossover from control therapy to olaparib.

Currently approved therapies that inhibit AR signaling, such as enzalutamide, rely solely on targeting the AR ligand-binding domain and, therefore, have limited efficacy on prostate cancer cells that express truncated, constitutively active AR splice variants (AR-Vs). The LNCaP95 cell line is a human prostate cancer cell line that expresses both functional full-length AR and AR-V7. LNCaP95 is a heterogeneous cell population that is resistant to enzalutamide, with its proliferation dependent on transcriptionally active AR-V7. The purpose of this study was to identify a LNCaP95 clone that would be useful for evaluating therapies for their effectiveness against enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells. Seven clones from the LNCaP95 cell line were isolated and characterized using morphology, in vitro growth rate, and response to ralaniten (AR N-terminal domain inhibitor) and enzalutamide (antiandrogen). In vivo growth of the clones as subcutaneous xenografts was evaluated in castrated immunodeficient mice. All of the clones maintained the expression of full-length AR and AR-V7. Cell proliferation of the clones was insensitive to androgen and enzalutamide but importantly was inhibited by ralaniten, which is consistent with AR-Vs driving the proliferation of parental LNCaP95 cells. In castrated immunodeficient animals, the growth of subcutaneous xenografts of the D3 clone was the most reproducible compared to the parental cell line and other clones. These data support that the enzalutamide-resistant LNCaP95-D3 subline may be suitable as a xenograft tumor model for preclinical drug development with improved reproducibility.""","""['Jacky K Leung', 'Teresa Tam', 'Jun Wang', 'Marianne D Sadar']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Hum Cell""","""['Combination therapy with androgen receptor N-terminal domain antagonist EPI-7170 and enzalutamide yields synergistic activity in AR-V7-positive prostate cancer.', 'Niclosamide inhibits androgen receptor variants expression and overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'KIF15-Mediated Stabilization of AR and AR-V7 Contributes to Enzalutamide Resistance in Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor splice variants in the era of enzalutamide and abiraterone.', 'Darolutamide as a Second-Generation Androgen Receptor Inhibitor in the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting androgen receptor and the variants by an orally bioavailable Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras compound in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'The Androgen Receptor and Its Crosstalk With the Src Kinase During Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer Progression.', '(+)-JJ-74-138 is a Novel Noncompetitive Androgen Receptor Antagonist.', 'Cyclin-dependent Kinase 4/6 Inhibitor Palbociclib in Combination with Ralaniten Analogs for the Treatment of Androgen Receptor-positive Prostate and Breast Cancers.', 'Pin1 inhibition improves the efficacy of ralaniten compounds that bind to the N-terminal domain of androgen receptor.']"""

Recent studies suggest the molecular signature was more effective than the clinical indicators for the prognostic prediction, but all of the known studies focused on a single RNA type. The present study was to develop a new prognostic signature by integrating long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and evaluate its prognostic performance.  Methods:   The RNA expression data of PCa patients were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) or Gene Expression Omnibus database (GSE17951, GSE7076, and GSE16560). The PCa-driven modules were identified by constructing a weighted gene coexpression network, the corresponding genes of which were overlapped with differentially expressed RNAs (DERs) screened by the MetaDE package. The optimal prognostic signature was screened using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis. The prognostic performance and functions of the combined prognostic signature was then assessed.  Results:   Twelve PCa-driven modules were identified using TCGA dataset and validated in the GSE17951 and GSE7076 datasets, and six of them were considered to be preserved. A total of 217 genes in these 6 modules were overlapped with 699 DERs, from which a nine-gene prognostic signature was identified (including 3 lncRNAs and 6 mRNAs), and the risk score of each patient was calculated. The overall survival was significantly shortened in patients having the risk score higher than the cut-off, which was demonstrated in TCGA (p = 5.063E - 03) dataset and validated in the GSE16560 (p = 3.268E - 02) dataset. The prediction accuracy of this risk score was higher than that of clinical indicators (the Gleason score and prostate-specific antigen) or the single RNA type, with the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.945. Besides, some new therapeutic targets and mechanisms (MAGI2-AS3-SPARC/GJA1/CYSLTR1, DLG5-AS1-DEFB1, and RHPN1-AS1-CDC45/ORC) were also revealed.

Methods:   all patients who presented to our urology division with bladder outlet obstruction secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostate cancer between January 2016 and January 2019 were included. Information on age, co-morbid conditions, presence of an indwelling catheter, bacteriologic analysis, imaging findings and histological diagnosis were obtained and analyzed using SPSS version 20.  Results:   de-novo urinary tract infection occurred in 35.6% of patients while recurrent infection occurred in 5.9% of them. The most commonly isolated organisms were gram-negative bacteria with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp, Citrobacter spp and Aerobacter spp accounting for 62.2%, 27.0%, 8.1% and 2.7% respectively. Nitrofurantoin (64.3%), Ceftriaxone (46.3%) and Genticin (42.9%) were the three most sensitive antimicrobials to the organisms isolated. Only the presence of an indwelling catheter in the bladder was an independent predictor of urinary tract infection in the study population.  Conclusion:   about one-third of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer develop urinary tract infection.

Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) for the reporting of prostate biopsy (PB) is conventionally based on fixation, processing, acquisition of glass slides, and analysis with an analog microscope by a local pathologist. Digitalization and real-time remote access to images could enhance the reporting process, and form the basis of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Fluorescence confocal microscopy (FCM), a novel optical technology, enables immediate digital image acquisition in an almost HE-like resolution without requiring conventional processing.  Objective:   The aim of this study is to assess the diagnostic ability of FCM for prostate cancer (PCa) identification and grading from PB.  Design, setting, and participants:   This is a prospective, comparative study evaluating FCM and HE for prostate tissue interpretation. PBs were performed (March to June 2019) at a single coordinating unit on consecutive patients with clinical and laboratory indications for assessment. FCM digital images (n = 427) were acquired immediately from PBs (from 54 patients) and stored; corresponding glass slides (n = 427) undergoing the conventional HE processing were digitalized and stored as well. A panel of four international pathologists with diverse background participated in the study and was asked to evaluate all images. The pathologists had no FCM expertise and were blinded to clinical data, HE interpretation, and each other's evaluation. All images, FCM and corresponding HE, were assessed for the presence or absence of cancer tissue and cancer grading, when appropriate. Reporting was gathered via a dedicated web platform.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary endpoint is to evaluate the ability of FCM to identify cancer tissue in PB cores (per-slice analysis). FCM outcomes are interpreted by agreement level with HE (K value). Additionally, either FCM or HE outcomes are assessed with interobserver agreement for cancer detection (presence vs absence of cancer) and for the discrimination between International Society of Urologic Pathologists (ISUP) grade = 1 and ISUP grade > 1 (secondary endpoint).  Results and limitations:   Overall, 854 images were evaluated from each pathologist. PCa detection of FCM was almost perfectly aligned with HE final reports (95.1% of correct diagnosis with FCM, κ = 0.84). Inter-rater agreement between pathologists was almost perfect for both HE and FCM for PCa detection (0.98 for HE, κ = 0.95; 0.95 for FCM, κ = 0.86); for cancer grade attribution, only a moderate agreement was reached for both HE and FCM (HE, κ = 0.47; FCM, κ = 0.49).  Conclusions:   FCM provides a microscopic, immediate, and seemingly reliable diagnosis for PCa. The real-time acquisition of digital images-without requiring conventional processing-offers opportunities for immediate sharing and reporting. FCM is a promising tool for improvements in cancer diagnostic pathways.  Patient summary:   Fluorescence confocal microscopy may provide an immediate, microscopic, and apparently reliable diagnosis of prostate cancer on prostate biopsy, overcoming the standard turnaround time of conventional processing and interpretation.""","""['Bernardo Rocco', 'Maria Chiara Sighinolfi', 'Marco Sandri', 'Valentina Spandri', 'Alessia Cimadamore', 'Metka Volavsek', 'Roberta Mazzucchelli', 'Antonio Lopez-Beltran', 'Ahmed Eissa', 'Laura Bertoni', 'Paola Azzoni', 'Luca Reggiani Bonetti', 'Antonino Maiorana', 'Stefano Puliatti', 'Salvatore Micali', 'Maurizio Paterlini', 'Andrea Iseppi', 'Francesco Rocco', 'Giovanni Pellacani', 'Johanna Chester', 'Giampaolo Bianchi', 'Rodolfo Montironi']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['Current and future perspectives of digital microscopy with fluorescence confocal microscope for prostate tissue interpretation: a narrative review.', 'Evaluation of Fluorescent Confocal Microscopy for Intraoperative Analysis of Prostate Biopsy Cores.', 'Digital Frozen Sections with Fluorescence Confocal Microscopy During Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Surgical Technique.', 'Development and Validation of an Artificial Intelligence-Powered Platform for Prostate Cancer Grading and Quantification.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Rapid On-Site Microscopy and Mapping of Diagnostic Biopsies for See-And-Treat Guidance of Localized Prostate Cancer Therapy.', 'Ex Vivo Fluorescence Confocal Microscopy (FCM) Ensures Representative Tissue in Prostate Cancer Biobanking: A Feasibility Study.', 'Ex vivo fluorescence confocal microscopy: chances and changes in the analysis of breast tissue.', 'Ex Vivo Fluorescence Confocal Microscopy (FCM) of Prostate Biopsies Rethought: Opportunities of Intraoperative Examinations of MRI-Guided Targeted Biopsies in Routine Diagnostics.', 'One-Day Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: Biparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Digital Pathology by Fluorescence Confocal Microscopy.']"""

Methods and materials:   A 22-item survey was sent to ABS membership in early 2019 to physicians, physicists, therapists, nurses, and administrators. Participation was voluntary. Responses were summarized with descriptive statistics and relative frequency distributions.  Results:   There were 103 unique responses. Approximately one in three was attending physicians and one in three attending physicists. Most were in practice >10 years. A total of 94% and 50% performed gynecologic and prostate brachytherapy, respectively. Ninety-one percent performed two-identification patient verification before treatment. Eighty-six percent performed a time-out. Ninety-five percent had an incident reporting or learning system, but only 71% regularly reviewed incidents. Half reviewed safety practices within the last year. Twenty percent reported they were somewhat or not satisfied with department safety culture, but 92% of respondents were interested in improving safety culture. Most reported time, communication, and staffing as barriers to improving safety. Most respondents desired safety-oriented webinars, self-assessment modules, learning modules, or checklists endorsed by the ABS to improve safety practice.  Conclusions:   Most but not all practices use standards and quality assurance procedures in line with society recommendations. There is a need to heighten safety culture at many departments and to shift resources (e.g., time or staffing) to improve safety practice.

Enhanced resident education may help reverse this trend. We therefore developed and implemented a simulation-based medical education course for low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy (LDR-PB).  Materials and methods:   A 1-week LDR-PB course comprised four 1-h lectures on clinical outcomes, physics, radiobiology, and anatomy/contouring, followed by a 4.5-h simulation session on ultrasound-guided prostate phantom implantation, was developed for radiation oncology residents at an academic institution. A 10-statement Likert-scale survey and 20-question multiple-choice test were administered 1 week before and 4 weeks after the course.  Results:   Precourse and postcourse instruments were completed by 24 and 20 residents, respectively. The median number of prior LDR-PB cases after at least one genitourinary rotation was 10.5 (range 5-20). Overall mean test scores were significantly improved (55% before the course vs 68% after the course; p = 0.010). Mean Likert scores significantly increased on nine of 10 survey statements and were significantly increased overall (2.4 before the course vs 3.3 after the course, p < 0.001). When asked about interest in performing brachytherapy after residency, 37.5% of residents ""agreed"" or ""strongly agreed"" before the course vs 50% after the course (p = 0.41). Those with higher postresidency brachytherapy interest (scores of 4-5 vs 1-3) had significantly more LDR-PB cases (11.2 vs 5.3 cases; p = 0.005).  Conclusions:   A 1-week simulation-based medical education course for LDR-PB can improve didactic performance and self-reported technical competence/confidence, and may increase overall enthusiasm for brachytherapy.

We aimed to analyze the chemopreventive role of metformin, in conjunction with other putative chemopreventive medications (statins, proton-pump-inhibitors, alpha-blockers, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors, diabetic medications) in a population-based cohort study.  Methods:   Data were incorporated from the Institute for Clinical and Evaluative Sciences to identify all diabetic men aged 66 and above with prior history of a negative prostate biopsy (PB) between 1994 and 2016, who were not on any of the medications prior to study inclusion. Multivariable Cox regression models with time-dependent covariates were used to assess the association of metformin to CaP diagnosis, subsequent PB, and use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). All models were adjusted for age, rurality, comorbidity, and year of study inclusion.  Results:   Overall, 2,332 diabetic men were included, with a median follow-up time of 9.4 years (interquartile range 5.4-13.4 years). A total of 2,036 patients (87.3%) received metformin.

However, its potential effects on the tumor immune microenvironment (TIM) of PCa patients and the underlying mechanism remain largely unclear. To explore the effects of ADT on PCa TIM, RNA sequencing was performed on six paired pre-ADT biopsy and post-ADT PCa lesions, and five paired paracancerous benign tissues from patients receiving neoadjuvant ADT with locally advanced PCa. Bioinformatics methods including ESTIMATE and ssGSEA were used to evaluate the stromal immune score and immune cell infiltration in PCa and paracancerous tissues. Weighted correlation network analysis was used to screen hub genes in the ADT-induced immune remodeling process. The results showed differences exist between PCa and paracancerous tissues in response to ADT. Compared with paracancerous tissues, the immune remodeling effect of ADT in PCa was more intense. ZFP36, JUNB, and SOCS3 served as hub genes in the ADT-induced immune remodeling process and were associated with PSA recurrent-free survival in the TCGA and our neoadjuvant ADT cohort. To investigate the joint action of the above three hub genes, an immune signature score was constructed. The results showed that immune signature score-based immune subtypes reveal the heterogeneity of the immune microenvironment of PCa and showed significant differences in patient prognosis, tumor immune infiltration, mutation burden, and landscape.""","""['Xingbo Long', 'Huimin Hou', 'Xuan Wang', 'Shengjie Liu', 'Tongxiang Diao', 'Shicong Lai', 'Maolin Hu', 'Shengqi Zhang', 'Ming Liu#', 'Hong Zhang#']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Differences in time to disease progression do not predict for cancer-specific survival in patients receiving immediate or deferred androgen-deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: final results of EORTC randomized trial 30891 with 12 years of follow-up.', 'Identification of bicalutamide resistance-related genes and prognosis prediction in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Biochemical recurrence related metabolic novel signature associates with immunity and ADT treatment responses in prostate cancer.', 'Intermittent androgen-deprivation therapy in prostate cancer: a critical review focused on phase 3 trials.', 'Androgen-deprivation therapy alone versus combined with radiation therapy or chemotherapy for nonlocalized prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Immunogenomic profiles associated with response to life-prolonging agents in prostate cancer.', 'Urinary tract infection after radiation therapy or radical prostatectomy on the prognosis of patients with prostate cancer: a population-based study.', 'Tumor immune contexture predicts recurrence after prostatectomy and efficacy of androgen deprivation and immunotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'Overexpression of Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzyme E2C Is Associated with Worsened Prognosis in Prostate Cancer.', 'Cancer-cell-intrinsic mechanisms shaping the immunosuppressive landscape of prostate cancer.']"""

However, there are difficulties in the collection, labeling and management of medical imaging data, because of ethical complications and the limited number of imaging studies available at a single facility. This study aimed to find a simple and low-cost method to increase the accuracy of deep learning semantic segmentation for radiation therapy of prostate cancer.  Methods:   In total, 556 cases with non-contrast CT images for prostate cancer radiation therapy were examined using a two-dimensional U-Net. Initially, all slices were used for the input data. Then, we removed slices of the cranial portions, which were beyond the margins of the bladder and rectum. Finally, the ground truth labels for the bladder and rectum were added as channels to the input for the prostate training dataset.  Results:   The highest mean dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) for each organ in the test dataset of 56 cases were 0.85 ± 0.05, 0.94 ± 0.04 and 0.85 ± 0.07 for the prostate, bladder and rectum, respectively. Removal of the cranial slices from the original images significantly increased the DSC of the rectum from 0.83 ± 0.09 to 0.85 ± 0.07 (p < 0.05). Adding bladder and rectum information to prostate training without removing the slices significantly increased the DSC of the prostate from 0.79 ± 0.05 to 0.85 ± 0.05 (p < 0.05).  Conclusions:   These cost-free approaches may be useful for new applications, which may include updated models and datasets. They may be applicable to other organs at risk (OARs) and clinical targets such as elective nodal irradiation.""","""['Takafumi Nemoto', 'Natsumi Futakami', 'Masamichi Yagi', 'Etsuo Kunieda', 'Takeshi Akiba', 'Atsuya Takeda', 'Naoyuki Shigematsu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Phys Med""","""['ARPM-net: A novel CNN-based adversarial method with Markov random field enhancement for prostate and organs at risk segmentation in pelvic CT images.', 'Patient-specific transfer learning for auto-segmentation in adaptive 0.35 T MRgRT of prostate cancer: a bi-centric evaluation.', 'AnatomyNet: Deep learning for fast and fully automated whole-volume segmentation of head and neck anatomy.', 'Automatic Segmentation of Multiple Organs on 3D CT Images by Using Deep Learning Approaches.', 'Deep Learning in Radiation Oncology Treatment Planning for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Systematic Review of Tumor Segmentation Strategies for Bone Metastases.', 'A Survey on Deep Learning for Precision Oncology.', 'Deep Learning in Cancer Diagnosis and Prognosis Prediction: A Minireview on Challenges, Recent Trends, and Future Directions.', 'Analytical performance of aPROMISE: automated anatomic contextualization, detection, and quantification of 18FDCFPyL (PSMA) imaging for standardized reporting.', 'Artificial intelligence and machine learning for medical imaging: A technology review.']"""

Methods:   Within Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database (2010-2015), we identified low risk and favorable intermediate risk CaP patients according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Descriptives and logistic regression models were used. Furthermore, a subgroup analysis was performed to test the association between Mexican-American vs. Caucasian racial and/or ethnic groups and upgrading either to Gleason-Grade Group (GGG II) or to GGG III, IV or V, in low risk or favorable intermediate risk CaP patients, respectively.  Results:   We identified 673 (2.6%) Mexican-American and 24,959 (97.4%) Caucasian CaP patients. Of those, 14,789 were low risk (434 [2.9%] Mexican-Americans vs. 14,355 [97.1%] Caucasians) and 10,834 were favorable intermediate risk (239 [2.2%] Mexican-Americans vs. 10,604 [97.8%] Caucasians). In low risk CaP patients, Mexican-American vs. Caucasian racial and/or ethnic group did not result in either upgrading or upstaging differences. However, in favorable intermediate risk CaP patients, upgrading rate was higher in Mexican-Americans than in Caucasians (31.4 vs. 25.5%, OR 1.33, P = 0.044), but no difference was recorded for upstaging. When comparisons focused on upgrading to GGG III, IV or V, higher rate was recorded in Mexican-American relative to Caucasian favorable intermediate risk CaP patients (20.4 vs. 15.4%, OR 1.41, P = 0.034).

Its incidence is estimated to grow to 1.7 million new cases and 499,000 new deaths by 2030. Treatment of OCPC can affect patients physically and mentally, as well as their close relationships and their job or career, which conditions health-related quality of life (QoL).  Objective:   Evaluate the impact on QoL attributable to the treatment for Organ Confined Prostate Cancer (OCPC).  Materials and methods:   Prospective multicenter observational study of 406 patients with OCPC treated from January 2015 to June 2018. The sample was divided into four study groups, according to the type of treatment: radical prostatectomy (RP) (GA), external radiotherapy (ERT) (GB), brachytherapy (BT) (GC) and other treatments different from monotherapy with RP, ERT or BT (GD).  Results:   The age in GC was lower, the mean Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) of all patients was 8.13 ng/ml, the group with the highest mean PSA was GB with a mean of 10.43 ng/dL, the mean Tumor Stage (TNM) was 3.82, and GD had the lowest post treatment quality of life.  Conclusion:   OCPC treatment affects QoL. Curative monotherapies, specifically RP and BT, have less effect on QoL than external radiotherapy or other therapeutic alternatives. Urinary incontinence and fistulas secondary to OCPC have the highest impact on QOL impairment. The internationally validated SF 36 questionnaire is a useful cross-sectional measure of QOL to compare the impact of OCPC treatment modalities.""","""['A Alvarez-Ossorio-Rodal', 'B Padilla-Fernandez', 'C A Muller-Arteaga', 'F Miglioni', 'J L Alvarez-Ossorio-Fernandez', 'S Valverde-Martínez', 'M T Marquez-Sanchez', 'M C Flores-Fraile', 'N A Linares-Mesa', 'J A Miron-Canelo', 'M B Garcia-Cenador', 'M F Lorenzo-Gomez']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Actas Urol Esp (Engl Ed)""","""['Health-related quality of life in men with prostate cancer undergoing active surveillance versus radical prostatectomy, external-beam radiotherapy, prostate brachytherapy and reference population: a cross-sectional study.', 'Determinants of long-term quality of life and voiding function of patients treated with radical prostatectomy or permanent brachytherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Benefits and Risks of Primary Treatments for High-risk Localized and Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer: An International Multidisciplinary Systematic Review.', 'Quality of Life Outcomes after Primary Treatment for Clinically Localised Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Low-dose rate brachytherapy for men with localized prostate cancer.']"""

Around 40% of cancer cures include the use of radiotherapy, either as a single strategy or combined with other treatments. In the past decade, substantial technical advances and novel insights into radiobiological properties have considerably improved patients' outcomes. This study overviewed the landscape of clinical research at our radiotherapy department.  Methods:   We surveyed our institutional database of clinical trials to collect information for completed or ongoing radiation therapy clinical trials, from 2005 to December 2017 at the Lucien Neuwirth cancer institute.  Results:   A total of 31 clinical trials were undertaken during the study period, of which 4 studies (12.9%) were industry-sponsored and 3 studies (9.7%) were launched by our radiotherapy unit. The vast majority of clinical trials (83.9%) were dedicated to unique organ localization, especially urological cancer (prostate or bladder) (42%). We also observed a shift towards more phase II trials during the study period as well as a special focus on elderly population. Over the last decade, the number of included patients increased by a 5.3 fold input, with 135 inclusions before 2011 and 720 inclusions after 2011.  Discussion:   This study provided an observational and comprehensive analysis of radiotherapy research.

We studied prostate cancer (PCa) protein-protein interaction (PPI) network constructed from patients' gene expression datasets and found that the network exhibits hierarchical scale free topology which lacks centrality lethality rule. Knockout experiments of the sets of leading hubs from the network leads to transition from hierarchical (HN) to scale free (SF) topology affecting network integration and organization. This transition, HN → SF, due to removal of significant number of the highest degree hubs, leads to relatively decrease in information processing efficiency, cost effectiveness of signal propagation, compactness, clustering of nodes and energy distributions. A systematic transition from a diassortative PCa PPI network to assortative networks after the removal of top 50 hubs then again reverting to disassortativity nature on further removal of the hubs was also observed indicating the dominance of the largest hubs in PCa network intergration. Further, functional classification of the hubs done by using within module degrees and participation coefficients for PCa network, and leading hubs knockout experiments indicated that kinless hubs serve as the basis of establishing links among constituting modules and heterogeneous nodes to maintain network stabilization. We, then, checked the essentiality of the hubs in the knockout experiment by performing Fisher's exact test on the hubs, and showed that removal of kinless hubs corresponded to maximum lethality in the network.

We aimed to elucidate the characteristics of this unknown entity and its potential clinical implications for radiotherapy.  Materials and methods:   The presence and configuration of the PSMA-positive area was evaluated in a retrospective cohort of consecutively scanned patients with prostate or urethral gland cancer (n = 100). Morphological and histological characteristics were assessed in a human cadaver study (n = 2). The effect of radiotherapy (RT) on salivation and swallowing was retrospectively investigated using prospectively collected clinical data from a cohort of head-neck cancer patients (n = 723). With multivariable logistic regression analysis, the association between radiotherapy (RT) dose and xerostomia or dysphagia was evaluated.  Results:   All 100 patients demonstrated a demarcated bilateral PSMA-positive area (average length 4 cm). Histology and 3D reconstruction confirmed the presence of PSMA-expressing, predominantly mucous glands with multiple draining ducts, predominantly near the torus tubarius. In the head-neck cancer patients, the mean RT dose to the gland area was significantly associated with physician-rated post-treatment xerostomia and dysphagia ≥ grade 2 at 12 months (0.019/gy, 95%CI 0.005-0.033, p = .007; 0.016/gy, 95%CI 0.001-0.031, p = .036).

Artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods can provide an objective image analysis. We aimed at developing and validating an AI-based tool for detection of lymph node lesions.  Methods:   A group of 399 patients with biopsy-proven PCa who had undergone 18 F-choline PET/CT for staging prior to treatment were used to train (n = 319) and test (n = 80) the AI-based tool. The tool consisted of convolutional neural networks using complete PET/CT scans as inputs. In the test set, the AI-based lymph node detections were compared to those of two independent readers. The association with PCa-specific survival was investigated.  Results:   The AI-based tool detected more lymph node lesions than Reader B (98 vs. 87/117; p = .045) using Reader A as reference. AI-based tool and Reader A showed similar performance (90 vs. 87/111; p = .63) using Reader B as reference. The number of lymph node lesions detected by the AI-based tool, PSA, and curative treatment was significantly associated with PCa-specific survival.

We examined in a population-based case-control study (MCC-Spain) if the time-of-day when physical activity is done affects prostate and breast cancer risk. Lifetime recreational and household physical activity was assessed by in-person interviews. Information on time-of-day of activity (assessed approximately 3 years after the assessment of lifetime physical activity and confounders) was available for 781 breast cancer cases, 865 population female controls, 504 prostate cases and 645 population male controls from 10 Spanish regions, 2008-2013.

Here, we further investigate this treatment using larger, more clinically relevant tumor models. New Zealand white rabbits bearing prostate tumor (PC3) xenografts received a single treatment of either ultrasound-stimulated microbubbles (USMB), ionizing radiation (XRT; 8Gy), or a combination of both treatments (USMB+XRT). Treatment outcome was evaluated 24 hours after treatment using histopathology, immunolabeling, 3D Doppler ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging. A second cohort of rabbits received multiple treatments over a period of three weeks, where USMB treatments were delivered twice weekly with daily XRT treatments to deliver a fractionated 2Gy dose five days per week. A significant decrease in vascular function, observed through immunolabeling of vascular endothelial cells, was observed in tumors receiving the combined treatment (USMB+XRT) compared to control and single treatment groups. This was associated with an increase in cell death as observed through in situ end labeling (ISEL), a decrease in vascular index measured by Power Doppler imaging, and a decrease in oxygen saturation. In rabbits undergoing the long-term fractionated combined treatment, a significant growth delay was observed after 1 week and a significant reduction in tumor size was observed after 3 weeks with combined therapy. Results demonstrated an enhancement of radiation effect and superior anti-tumor effect of the combination of USMB+XRT compared to the single treatments alone.

Although intermittent ADT (iADT) is noninferior to continuous ADT for prostate cancer outcomes, with superior quality of life and cost-to-benefit ratio, little is known regarding its real-world utilization. The authors aimed to determine the utilization of iADT in a Canadian Provincial Cancer Program for relapsed nmHSPC and identified risk factors associated with the nonreceipt of iADT.  Materials and methods:   This retrospective population-based cohort study used linked administrative databases to identify all patients with relapsed nmHSPC from 2012 to 2016 and quantified ADT prescription history. Patients were defined as iADT eligible if prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was <4 ng/mL and trending downwards on ≥2 sequential PSAs after ≥6 months of ADT. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine factors associated with nonreceipt of iADT.  Results:   A total of 601 men with relapsed, nmHSPC were included with a median age at relapse of 73 (range, 46 to 96), pre-ADT PSA of 12.2 ng/mL, and a median pre-ADT PSA doubling time of 7.8 months. 80.9% of the cohort were eligible to receive iADT and 74.4% were treated with iADT. On multivariable analysis, patients originally treated with surgery (odds ratio [OR], 0.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.08-0.46) or having a Gleason Score ≥8 (OR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.12-0.78) had decreased odds of receipt of iADT. Patients with longer PSA doubling times were more likely to receive iADT (OR, 2.71; 95% CI, 1.17-6.31).  Conclusions:   The utilization of iADT was relatively common for men in Manitoba during the study period, however, the uptake of iADT can be improved among identified subgroups.""","""['Bryan W Janzen', 'Aldrich Ong', 'Makoy Penner', 'Rashmi Koul', 'Arbind Dubey', 'Shahida Ahmed', 'Bashir Bashir', 'Amitava Chowdhury', 'David E Dawe', 'Jasmir Nayak', 'Julian O Kim']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Am J Clin Oncol""","""['The effect of continuous androgen deprivation treatment on prostate cancer patients as compared with intermittent androgen deprivation treatment.', 'Real-World Practice Patterns and Predictors of Continuous versus Intermittent Androgen Deprivation Therapy Use for Prostate Cancer in Older Men.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Materials and methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry (2004-2016), we identified 207,714 patients. Age was categorized as: below 60 versus 60 to 69 versus 70 to 79 versus 80 years and above. Multivariable competing-risks regression (CRR) models were used according to disease stage (low-risk nonmuscle invasive: TaN0M0 low grade, high-risk nonmuscle invasive: Ta high grade or Tis-1N0M0, muscle invasive: T2-3N0M0, regional: T4N0M0/TanyN1-3M0, and metastatic: TanyNanyM1).  Results:   Overall, 33,970 (16.4%) versus 52,173 (25.1%) versus 64,537 (31.1%) versus 57,034 (27.4%) patients were below 60 versus 60 to 69 versus 70 to 79 versus 80 years and above, respectively. In multivariable CRR models that focused on low-risk nonmuscle invasive UCUB, advanced age was associated with higher CSM rates (hazard ratio [HR]: 7.04 in patients aged 80 y and above, relative to below 60 y; P<0.001). Moreover, advanced age was also associated with higher CSM rates in high-risk nonmuscle invasive UCUB (HR: 2.77 in patients aged 80 y and above, relative to below 60 y; P<0.001) and in muscle invasive UCUB patients (HR: 1.38 in patients aged 80 y and above, relative to below 60 y; P<0.001). Conversely, lower CSM rates with advanced age were observed in multivariable CRR that focused on regional (HR: 0.91 for patients aged 80 y and above, relative to below 60 y; P=0.02) or metastatic UCUB (HR: 0.75 for patients aged 80 y and above, relative to below 60 y; P<0.001).  Conclusions:   The direction and the magnitude of the association between advanced age and CSM in UCUB patients changes according to tumor stage. In low-risk nonmuscle invasive, high-risk nonmuscle invasive, and muscle invasive UCUB, more advanced age is associated with higher CSM rates. Conversely, in regional and metastatic UCUB patients, more advanced age is associated with lower CSM rates.""","""['Stefano Luzzago', 'Sophie Knipper', 'Carlotta Palumbo', 'Giuseppe Rosiello', 'Angela Pecoraro', 'Marina Deuker', 'Francesco A Mistretta', 'Zhe Tian', 'Gennaro Musi', 'Emanuele Montanari', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Fred Saad', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Ottavio de Cobelli', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Am J Clin Oncol""","""['Survival After Partial Cystectomy for Variant Histology Bladder Cancer Compared With Urothelial Carcinoma: A Population-based Study.', 'Bladder Cancer: A Comparison Between Non-urothelial Variant Histology and Urothelial Carcinoma Across All Stages and Treatment Modalities.', 'Increasing Rates of Perioperative Chemotherapy are Associated With Improved Survival in Men With Urothelial Bladder Cancer With Prostatic Stromal Invasion.', 'Micropapillary Versus Urothelial Carcinoma of the Urinary Bladder: Stage at Presentation and Efficacy of Chemotherapy Across All Stages-A SEER-based Study.', 'Urothelial neoplasms of the urinary bladder occurring in young adult and pediatric patients: a comprehensive review of literature with implications for patient management.', 'Impact of Age at Diagnosis of Bladder Cancer on Survival: A Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Based Study 2004-2015.', 'Possibilities and limitations of using low biomass samples for urologic disease and microbiome research.', 'Bladder cancer, inflammageing and microbiomes.', 'Young age increases the risk of lymph node positivity but improves prognosis in patients with bladder cancer treated via cystectomy: a population-based study.']"""

However, bone scintigraphy (BS) with technetium-labeled diphosphonates is cheap and widely available for the same patient population. PSMA PET comes with a cost, and financial constraints in the present economic environment may require its more selective use. In this study, we aimed to compare the diagnostic performance of BS with Ga-PSMA PET/CT for the detection of bone metastases in patients with PCa and correlate the results with various clinical and biochemical variables.  Materials and methods:   Ninety-five patients who underwent Ga-PSMA PET/CT and BS within 3 months for newly diagnosed or recurrent PCa were extracted from our database. Lesion, region and patient-based analyses were performed. Clinical and imaging follow-up was used as the reference test. Results were compared with tumor grade, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) values.  Results:   On the patient-based analysis, 75% (42/56) and 98.2% (55/56) of the patients with bone metastases were correctly diagnosed by BS and Ga-PSMA PET, respectively. In 26/95 patients with equivocal lesions on BS, Ga-PSMA PET correctly reclassified skeletal involvement in 11 and excluded metastases in 15 patients BS missed bone metastases in 3 patients. The true-positive rate of BS in patients with serum ALP ≥ 120U/L and PSA ≥ 50 ng/ml was 95.8% and 87.5 respectively.  Conclusion:   Ga-PSMA is superior to BS for the evaluation of metastatic disease in patients with PCa. However, BS can also detect bone metastases in patients with PCa with a minimum sensitivity of 75%. Biochemical data are helpful to select patients with a high pretest probability who should undergo BS first as a part of the initial workup from an economic point of view. Due to its higher cost, Ga-PSMA PET should be performed in a selective group of patients when BS results are inconclusive or metastasis-directed therapy is planned.""","""['Meltem Caglar', 'Murat Tuncel', 'Egemen Yildiz', 'Erdem Karabulut']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Ann Nucl Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Head-To-Head Comparison of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and 99mTc-MDP Bone Scintigraphy for the Detection of Bone Metastases in Patients With Prostate Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Does bone scintigraphy still have a role in the era of 68\xa0Ga-PSMA PET/CT in prostate cancer?', '68Ga-PSMA PET/CT Replacing Bone Scan in the Initial Staging of Skeletal Metastasis in Prostate Cancer: A Fait Accompli?', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'The Role of 18FF-Choline PET/CT in the Initial Management and Outcome Prediction of Prostate Cancer: A Real-World Experience from a Multidisciplinary Approach.', 'Skull base metastases with cranial nerve deficits : Clinical profile of a severe disease.']"""

Methods:   T1 phantom images acquired on 2 scanners, FLAIR and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (CE-T1w) images of 18 brain tumor patients scanned on both 1.5-T and 3-T scanners, and 36 T2-weighted (T2w) images of prostate cancer patients scanned in one of two centers were investigated. The ComBat procedure was used for harmonizing radiomic features. Differences in statistical distributions in feature values between 1.5- and 3-T images were tested before and after harmonization. The prostate studies were used to determine the impact of harmonization to distinguish between Gleason grades (GGs).  Results:   In the phantom data, 40 out of 42 radiomic feature values were significantly different between the 2 scanners before harmonization and none after. In white matter regions, the statistical distributions of features were significantly different (p < 0.05) between the 1.5- and 3-T images for 37 out of 42 features in both FLAIR and CE-T1w images. After harmonization, no statistically significant differences were observed. In brain tumors, 41 (FLAIR) or 36 (CE-T1w) out of 42 features were significantly different between the 1.5- and 3-T images without harmonization, against 1 (FLAIR) or none (CE-T1w) with harmonization. In prostate studies, 636 radiomic features were significantly different between GGs after harmonization against 461 before. The ability to distinguish between GGs using radiomic features was increased after harmonization.  Conclusion:   ComBat harmonization efficiently removes inter-center technical inconsistencies in radiomic feature values and increases the sensitivity of studies using data from several scanners.

Methods:   Prospective audit of demographic and clinical data between August 2011 and November 2017 was conducted for same-day urological assessment and/or trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsies with peri-prostatic infiltration local anaesthetic (PILA) and antibiotic prophylaxis.  Results:   A total of 466 (47%) rural and 534 (53%) metropolitan men attended. Rural mean (range) age was 63 years (38-86) and 65 years (37-89) for metro men (P = 0.006). Rural median (range) prostate specific antigen (PSA) level was 6.7 g/mL (0.2-450) and 7.3 ng/mL (0.5-860) for metro men (P = 0.011). Twenty-five men (2.5%) refused/could not tolerate TRUS-guided biopsy using PILA. One hundred and fifty-one (15%) men had multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging prior to TRUS biopsy and 876 (88%) men had prostate biopsies, with a new cancer diagnostic rate of 51% (443 men). Clinically significant prostate cancer was detected in 339 (34%) men. The overall infective complication rate requiring hospital admission rose from 1.4% to 2.9% after the prophylactic antibiotic regimen changed from six doses of 500 mg ciprofloxacin to a single dose of 500 mg (P = 0.398).  Conclusion:   This is the largest single institution prospective TRUS prostate biopsy series in Australasia. Biopsies using PILA were well tolerated with low complication rates and diagnosed a high rate of clinically significant prostate cancer.

RDD generally presents with an indolent nature and follows a benign disease course, although more aggressive cases have been reported. The condition predominately affects children and young adults. It is classically characterized by massive, bilateral painless lymphadenopathy and accumulation of CD68-positive, S100-positive, CD1a-negative histiocytes, with the presence of emperipolesis as a hallmark. Herein, we present an aggressive case in a 76-year-old male with past medical history significant for prostate cancer, who presented with a 7-month history of lymphadenopathy and new onset of multiple large abdominal wall, cutaneous, lymph node, liver, and lung masses, all of which were histopathologically atypical, but showed features consistent with RDD, including emperipolesis and strong S100 positivity. Molecular studies showed a KRAS 117N mutation, which has been recently reported in RDD.

All enrolled patients who receive ⩾1 dose of Omnitrope® are included in the safety population. Malignancies are listed as adverse events under the MedDRA System Organ Class 'neoplasms, benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps)'.  Results:   As of July 2018, 1293 patients had been enrolled in the study and 983 (76.0%) remained active in the study. Approximately half [n = 637 (49.3%)] of the patients were GH treatment-naïve on study entry. The majority of enrolled patients had multiple pituitary hormone deficiency (n = 1128, 87.2%).

Functional inferencing elucidates a coinciding increase in bacterial biosynthesis of vitamin K2 (an inhibitor of androgen dependent and independent tumor growth). These results are highly reproducible in a host-free gut model, excluding the possibility of immune involvement. Further investigation reveals that AA is metabolized by bacteria in vitro and that breakdown components selectively impact growth.

Objective:   To develop and externally validate nomograms including multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) information to predict side-specific EPE.  Design, setting, and participants:   A retrospective analysis of 1870 consecutive prostate cancer patients who underwent robot-assisted RP from 2014 to 2018 at three institutions.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Four multivariable logistic regression models were established, including combinations of patient-based and side-specific variables: prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density, highest ipsilateral International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) biopsy grade, ipsilateral percentage of positive cores on systematic biopsy, and side-specific clinical stage assessed by both digital rectal examination and mpMRI. Discrimination (area under the curve [AUC]), calibration, and net benefit of these models were assessed in the development cohort and two external validation cohorts.  Results and limitations:   On external validation, AUCs of the four models ranged from 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68-0.88) to 0.83 (95% CI 0.72-0.90) in cohort 1 and from 0.77 (95% CI 0.62-0.87) to 0.78 (95% CI 0.64-0.88) in cohort 2. The three models including mpMRI staging information resulted in relatively higher AUCs compared with the model without mpMRI information. No major differences between the four models regarding net benefit were established. The model based on PSA density, ISUP grade, and mpMRI T stage was superior in terms of calibration. Using this model with a cut-off of 20%, 1980/2908 (68%) prostatic lobes without EPE would be found eligible for nerve sparing, whereas non-nerve sparing would be advised in 642/832 (77%) lobes with EPE.  Conclusions:   Our analysis resulted in a simple and robust nomogram for the prediction of side-specific EPE, which should be used to select patients for nerve-sparing RP.

Therefore, we evaluated the effect of seahorse on human prostate cancer using various in vitro methods and identified bioactive compound. Seahorse lipid extract (SHL) decreased androgen receptor (AR) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) expression in dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-induced LNCaP cells of prostate cancer. Gas Chromatography (GC)-mass spectrometry data showed that brassicasterol was present in H. abdominalis. Brassicasterol downregulated the expression of AR and PSA in DHT-induced LNCaP cells.

Design:   Cross-sectional analysis from the 2011 National Health and Aging Trends Study.  Setting:   In-person interviews in the homes of study participants.  Participants:   Nationally representative sample of community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries, aged 65 and older (n = 6,080 including 1,203 survivors).  Measurements:   Participants were asked about cancer history, pain that limited activity, mobility device use (eg, canes, walkers, wheelchairs, and scooters), history of falls, and medical conditions plus they were assessed for approximate mobility disability using a 3-m gait speed test. The results were scored on a scale of 0 to 4 (0 = lowest, 4 = highest) using criteria from the National Institute on Aging.  Results:   A total of 19% of older adults and 23% of survivors reported using one or more mobility device, most commonly a single-point cane. Approximately 10% of breast, 6% of prostate, and 3% of colorectal cancer survivors reported using two or more devices in the past month. Survivors had lower mean gait speed scores (2.27) than adults without cancer history (2.39). In regression models, survivors were 18% less likely than adults without cancer history to score high on the gait speed test (odds ratio = .82; P < .05). Prior mobility device use, history of multiple falls, unhealthy weight, Black race, multimorbidity, and pain that limited activity were associated with lower gait speed scores in all participants (all P < .05).  Conclusion:   A greater proportion of older survivors used mobility devices than adults without cancer history. Mobility device use varied by cancer site and was highest in survivors of breast, colorectal, and gynecological cancer.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cabazitaxel (CBZ) treatment and examine the prognostic factors for oncological outcomes in patients with mCRPC who received CBZ after docetaxel (DOC).  Methods:   This multi-institutional retrospective study included 44 patients with mCRPC who received CBZ. All enrolled patients had histologically confirmed prostate cancer (PCa) with distant metastases and had received DOC before CBZ administration. The primary endpoint was the oncological outcomes, including the overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoints were adverse events due to CBZ and rates of ≥30% reduction in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels.  Results:   The median follow-up period was 9.2 months (range, 0.2-34 months). During this time, 34 patients (77%) died of PCa. The median OS and PFS were 12.2 (range, 0.2-34 months) and 1.4 months (range, 0.4-17 months), respectively. According to the PSA decline rate, patients who achieved a ≥30% reduction in PSA levels had significantly longer OS than those who showed a <30% reduction in PSA levels (P = 0.002).

However, this approach may result in a high rate of negative biopsies and increased detection of clinically insignificant PCa (CS-PCa). An important prognostic biomarker, PSA density (PSA-D) demonstrated improved performance in PCa detection compared to PSA. The relationship between prostate volume and the prognostic accuracy of PSA-D remains mostly unclear. The aim of our study is to investigate the PSA-D predictive value of CS-PCa detection at different prostate volumes.  Methods:   Using our local radical prostatectomy registry, patients were divided into three prostate size subgroups based on preoperative sonographic prostate volume assessment: less than 50, 50-75, and more than 75 cc. Patients' and PCa characteristics were recorded, including age, body mass index, PSA at diagnosis, prostate volume, PSA-D, D'Amico risk classification, Gleason grade group, and pathological staging following surgery.  Results:   The study cohort included 364 patients who underwent Robotic Radical prostatectomy for biopsy-proven clinically localized PCa. 221 (61%) and 143 (39%) patients had PSA-D less than 0.15 and PSA-D more than 0.15, respectively. ISUP GG 1-2 PCa (CS-PCa) was observed in 220 patients (60%), while 144 (40%) had ISUP GG 3-5 PCa at final pathology. PSA-D correlated with CS-PCa only in small and medium-size prostates, but not in large glands (p = .03, p = .01, and p = .36, respectively). The highest sensitivity (72.7%) was observed in small prostates, compared to 3.2% in large prostates. The highest specificity (89.4%) was noted in large prostates. Positive predictive value in small and medium-size prostates was similar (~50%), compared to 20% in large glands. The negative predictive value was slightly better for small and medium-size prostates compared with large glands (68.9%, 73.7%, and 53.1%, respectively). An association between PSA-D and harboring CS-PCa was detected only in small and medium-size glands (72.7% and 43%, respectively).  Conclusion:   PSA-D is associated with CS-PCa detection in radical prostatectomy specimens in small and medium-size prostates. The level of PSA-D is directly associated with the ISUP PCa grade group. Therefore, PSA-D is a beneficial, available, and cost-effective tool during decision-making in patients with small and medium-size prostate when considering treatment for PCa.""","""['Nativ Omri', 'Malshy Kamil', 'Kastin Alexander', 'Kravtzov Alexander', 'Sabo Edmond', 'Zisman Ariel', 'Kakiashvili David', 'Amiel E Gilad', 'Hoffman Azik']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['The role of the digital rectal examination as diagnostic test for prostate cancer detection in obese patients.', 'Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer in Patients with Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) in the Gray Area: Construction of 2 Predictive Models.', 'Total and Gleason grade 4/5 cancer volumes are major contributors of human kallikrein 2, whereas free prostate specific antigen is largely contributed by benign gland volume in serum from patients with prostate cancer or benign prostatic biopsies.', 'Should men with serum prostate-specific antigen < or =4 ng/ml and normal digital rectal examination undergo a prostate biopsy?

Primary outcomes were clinician and patient satisfaction. Secondary outcomes included mutation rates and resource allocation.  Results:   Of 66 men offered testing, 63 (95%) accepted. Four pathogenic variants were identified (two BRCA2, one NBN, and one MSH6). Fifty patients and nine clinicians completed questionnaires. Satisfaction was high. All patients were pleased to have had testing overall, 98% (46 of 47) to have had testing at their usual oncology appointment, and all to receive results from their usual specialist, rather than a separate genetics appointment. A total of 88% (7 of 8) of clinicians felt confident, and all were satisfied with mainstreaming. Mainstreaming was resource efficient, requiring 87% fewer genetic consultations than traditional genetic counseling.

Using expression data from GENT2 databases, we evaluated gene expression in all anatomical districts from 32 normal tissues in 3902 individuals. Functional relationships with body districts were analyzed by chilibot. We performed DisGeNet, genemania and DAVID analyses to identify human diseases associated with these genes. Transcriptomic expression levels were then analyzed in 31 cancer types and healthy controls from approximately 43 000 individuals, using GEPIA2 and GENT2 databases. By performing receiver operating characteristic analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) was used to discriminate healthy from cancer patients. Coronavirus receptors were found to be expressed in several body districts. Moreover, the five genes were found to associate with acute respiratory syndrome, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer (i.e. the most frequent COVID-19 comorbidities). Their expression levels were found to be significantly altered in cancer types, including colon, kidney, liver, testis, thyroid and skin cancers (P < 0.0001); AUC > 0.80 suggests that TMPRSS2, CLEC4M and DPP4 are relevant markers of kidney, liver, and thyroid cancer, respectively.

The lower risk could be due to biologic differences and/or a diagnosis bias from use of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test as a screening and diagnostic tool. We sought to further examine the relationship between diabetes and incidence of prostate cancer and examine the potential impact of changes in PSA screening guidelines in 2008 and 2012.  Methods:   We used 2004-2015 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data and limited the study population to men aged 67-74 with at least 2 years of continuous enrollment. Using the 5% Medicare sample as the denominator and prostate cancer cases as the numerator, we calculated age-adjusted rate ratios (RR) in 2006-2011 and 2012-2015 by diabetes status, overall and by tumor grade. We used multivariable logistic regression to compare tumor characteristics by diabetes status.  Results:   Men with diabetes had lower incidence rates of prostate cancer compared to men without diabetes in 2006-2011 [RR = 0.89 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87-0.91] and 2012-2015 (RR = 0.92 95% CI 0.89-0.95) but the slight attenuation toward the null in 2012-2015 was primarily due to the change in RRs for low-grade tumors.  Conclusion:   We found differences in the risk and characteristics of prostate cancer by diabetes status and that some risks have changed over time as guidelines have changed.

However, response to Lu-PSMA therapy is only achieved in approximately half of patients. It is clinically important to identify patients at risk of poor outcome. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate pretherapeutic PSMA PET derived total tumor volume and related metrics as prognosticators of overall survival in patients receiving Lu-PSMA therapy.  Methods:   A total number of 110 patients form the Departments of Nuclear Medicine Münster and Essen were included in this retrospective analysis. Baseline PSMA PET-CT was available for all patients. Employing a previously published approach, all tumor lesions were semi-automatically delineated in PSMA PET-CT acquisitions. Total lesion number, total tumor volume (PSMA-TV), total lesion uptake (PSMA-TLU = PSMA-TV * SUVmean), and total lesion quotient (PSMA-TLQ = PSMA-TV / SUVmean) were quantified for each patient. Log2 transformation was used for regressions.  Results:   Lesion number, PSMA-TV, and PSMA-TLQ were prognosticators of overall survival (HR = 1.255, p = 0.009; HR = 1.299, p = 0.005; HR = 1.326, p = 0.002). In a stepwise backward Cox regression including lesion number, PSMA-TV, PSA, LDH, and PSMA-TLQ, only the latter two remained independent and statistically significant negative prognosticators of overall survival (HR = 1.632, p = 0.011; HR = 1.239, p = 0.024). PSMA-TLQ and LDH were significant negative prognosticators in multivariate Cox regression in contrast to PSA value.  Conclusion:   PSMA-TV was a statistically significant negative prognosticator of overall survival in patients receiving Lu-PSMA therapy. PSMA-TLQ was an independent and superior prognosticator of overall survival compared with PSMA-TV.""","""['Robert Seifert', 'Katharina Kessel', 'Katrin Schlack', 'Manuel Weber', 'Ken Herrmann', 'Maximilian Spanke', 'Wolfgang P Fendler', 'Boris Hadaschik', 'Jens Kleesiek', 'Michael Schäfers', 'Matthias Weckesser', 'Martin Boegemann', 'Kambiz Rahbar']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Total tumor volume reduction and low PSMA expression in patients receiving Lu-PSMA therapy.', 'Response assessment using 68Ga-PSMA ligand PET in patients undergoing 177Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Early molecular imaging response assessment based on determination of total viable tumor burden in 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT independently predicts overall survival in 177LuLu-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy.', 'Therapeutic Responses and Survival Effects of 177Lu-PSMA-617 Radioligand Therapy in Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Meta-analysis.', '177Lu-PSMA therapy : Current evidence for use in the treatment of patients with metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Role of volumetric parameters obtained from 68\xa0Ga-PSMA PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT in predicting overall survival in patients with mCRPC receiving taxane therapy.', 'Predicting the effect of different folate doses on 68GaGa-PSMA-11 organ and tumor uptake using physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling.', 'SUVmean on baseline 18FPSMA-1007 PET and clinical parameters are associated with survival in prostate cancer patients scheduled for 177LuLu-PSMA I&T.', 'Novel computational biology modeling system can accurately forecast response to neoadjuvant therapy in early breast cancer.', 'Advanced PSMA-PET/CT Imaging Parameters in Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer Patients for Predicting Metastatic Disease.']"""

Docetaxel (75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks with daily prednisone 10 mg) was combined with escalating doses of daily cabozantinib (20, 40 and 60 mg). Based on the results of the phase 1 study, the investigation was expanded into a randomized study of docetaxel with prednisone (hereafter 'docetaxel/prednisone') plus the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of cabozantinib compared with docetaxel/prednisone alone.  Results:   A total of 44 men with mCRPC were enrolled in this phase 1/2 trial. An MTD of 40 mg cabozantinib plus docetaxel/prednisone was determined. Dose-limiting toxicities were neutropenic fever and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, and there was one death attributable to a thromboembolic event. In addition, grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression, hypophosphataemia and neuropathy were seen in three or more patients. In the phase 1 study, the median time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) time were 13.6 and 16.3 months, respectively. In the phase 2 study, which was terminated early because of poor accrual, the median TTP and OS favoured the combination (n = 13) compared to docetaxel/prednisone alone (n = 12; 21.0 vs 6.6 months; P = 0.035 and 23.8 vs 15.6 months; P = 0.072, respectively).

Biochemical RFS, local RFS, overall survival (OS) and acute and late toxicity were assessed as secondary endpoints.  Patients and methods:   A retrospective cohort of 187 consecutive patients with pN1 PCa were treated with aRT at the IEO, European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, Milan, Italy. aRT on the tumour bed and pelvis was administered within 6 months of RP. Androgen deprivation therapy was administered according to the guidelines. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses predicting biochemical RFS, local RFS, distant RFS and OS rates were performed to assess whether the number of pN1s represented an independent prognostic factor. The Youden index was computed to find the optimal threshold for the number of pN1s able to discriminate between patients with or without biochemical and clinical relapse.  Results:   At 5 years, local RFS, distant RFS, biochemical RFS and OS were 68%, 71%, 56% and 94%, respectively. The median follow-up was 49 months. The number of pN1s was significantly associated with biochemical RFS, local RFS and distant RFS. The best threshold for discriminating between patients with or without biochemical and clinical relapse was five pN1s. In multivariate analyses, the number of pN1s was confirmed to be an independent predictor of biochemical RFS, local RFS and distant RFS, but not of OS. Multivariate analyses also showed an increased risk of biochemical relapse for increasing values of initial prostate-specific antigen and for patients with tumour vascular invasion. Local and distant RFS were also inversely correlated with significantly reduced risk for International Society of Urological Pathology grade group <3 (group 1 or 2 compared to group 3).  Conclusions:   Our data confirmed the encouraging outcomes of patients with pN1 PCa treated with adjuvant treatments and the key role represented by the number of pN1s in predicting biochemical RFS, clinical RFS and distant RFS.

Fc-ARMs can theoretically recruit most endogenous antibodies, inducing antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) to eliminate cancer cells. Herein, we describe new Fc-ARMs that target prostate cancer (Fc-ARM-Ps). Fc-ARM-Ps recruited antibodies to cancer cells expressing prostate-specific membrane antigen but did so with lower efficiency compared with Fc-ARMs targeting the folate receptor. Upon recruitment by Fc-ARM-P, defucosylated antibodies efficiently activated natural killer cells and induced ADCC, whereas antibodies with intact N-glycans did not.

Diagnosis and treatment for PCa can have a significant impact on the lives of both the man with PCa and his partner. This study explored the experiences and needs of younger men and their partners affected by PCa. The findings will be used to inform service provision and develop interventions appropriate to need.  Methods:   Participants were recruited from respondents to a national PROMS study (Life After Prostate Cancer Diagnosis (LAPCD), who indicated on completed questionnaires their willingness to be interviewed. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with twenty-eight couples, separately (56 participants). Data were analysed using the Framework Method.  Results:   Following the diagnosis of PCa, couples' experienced changes in their intimate relationships, parental/familial roles, work and finances, and social connections and activities. Couples adopted a range of strategies and behaviours to help their adjustment to PCa, such as communicating with each other, distancing, distraction, and adopting a positive mindset towards PCa. This, in turn, influenced how their identity as a couple evolved.  Conclusions:   Following a diagnosis of PCa, the identity of couples are continually evolving. It is important that these couples are provided with the appropriate information, support and resources to help them transition along the cancer pathway.  Implications for cancer survivors:   Key areas of support identified for younger couples include: 1) couple focused support programme to foster relationship strategies/behaviours that facilitate couple adjustment; 2) age-specific support, e.g. 'buddying systems' connecting younger couples affected by PCa and providing them with tailored information (written/online/app).""","""['Nicole Collaço', 'Richard Wagland', 'Obrey Alexis', 'Anna Gavin', 'Adam Glaser', 'Eila K Watson']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Cancer Surviv""","""['The challenges on the family unit faced by younger couples affected by prostate cancer: A qualitative study.', 'Understanding the sexual health perceptions, concerns, and needs of female partners of prostate cancer survivors.', 'Prostate cancer and the impact on couples: a qualitative metasynthesis.', 'Unmet Sexual Health Needs of Patients and Female Partners Following Diagnosis and Treatment for Prostate Cancer.', 'Co-constructing sexual recovery after prostate cancer: a qualitative study with couples.', 'Care needs of Japanese men for sexual dysfunction associated with prostate cancer treatment.', 'The lived experience of prostate cancer: 10-year survivor perspectives following contemporary treatment of localized prostate cancer.', ""A qualitative study about colorectal cancer patients and spousal caregivers' experience and needs during COVID-19: implications for self-efficacy intervention."", 'Sexual dysfunction associated with prostate cancer treatment in Japanese men: a qualitative research.', ""Men's experiences of sex and intimacy after prostate cancer treatment in China: a qualitative study.""]"""

To be effective and acceptable, future eHealth websites need to consider end-users' perspectives, capacity and needs. We aim to provide insight into these factors by exploring daily priorities, activities and health literacy of individuals with metastatic prostate cancer and their perspectives towards exercise and exercise-based web-based eHealth interventions.  Methods:   Semi-structured interviews explored participant's experiences and understanding of their disease, exercise levels, advice received from health care providers, as well as acceptability of and suggested content for an eHealth tool. A thematic analysis was undertaken.  Results:   Interviews were conducted with eighteen Australians (55-83 years; M = 71.5, SD = 8.9) living with metastatic prostate cancer. Needing to perform daily responsibilities was a key priority. Participants had limited understanding of the benefits of prostate cancer-specific exercise, and less than half discussed exercise with their health team. Fourteen men felt they could report metastases location, but only four could provide detailed information, which has clinical implications for exercise prescription. A potential web-based intervention was considered acceptable by seventeen men for reasons such as affordability, accessibility and convenience.

The human prostate cell line, PC-3, was exposed to docetaxel, the concentrations of which were increased in a stepwise manner in the medium to select the drug-resistant cell line, PC-3/DTX. The morphological features were observed using inverted microscopy. The growth curves of PC-3 and PC-3/DTX cells were drawn to calculate the doubling time. Flow cytometry was performed to determine cell-cycle distribution. A 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazol)-2,5-diphenyl-2H tetrazolium bromide assay was performed to test the drug resistance of PC-3 and PC-3/DTX cells. Western blot analysis was conducted to determine the protein expression levels of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, which may serve a role in regulating drug resistance in the two cell lines. PC-3/DTX cells exhibited changes in morphology, proliferation rate, doubling time and cell-cycle distributions, compared with PC-3 cells. PC-3/DTX cells were 10.9-fold resistant to docetaxel in comparison with PC-3 cells. The results showed that PC-3/DTX cells overexpressed Rictor and p-AKT(S473) proteins, which are specific subunits or downstream substrates of mTORC2. The new findings suggested that the mTORC2 signaling pathway may serve an important role in the regulation of docetaxel drug resistance of PC-3 cells. In conclusion, PC-3/DTX cells may be applied to study the resistance of anticancer drugs and to identify methods to overcome resistance.""","""['Jian Liu', 'Yujie Huang', 'Danyan Zhu', 'Yao Dai', 'Dan Liu', 'You Zhai', 'Xingguang Liang', 'Lihua Wu', 'Qingwei Zhao']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Oncol Lett""","""['Targeting mTOR Complex 2 in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer with Acquired Docetaxel Resistance.', 'Protein Disulfide Isomerase 4 Drives Docetaxel Resistance in Prostate Cancer.', 'Long noncoding RNA DANCR contributes to docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer through targeting the miR-34a-5p/JAG1 pathway.', 'Augmentation of Docetaxel-Induced Cytotoxicity in Human PC-3 Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer Cells by Combination With Four Natural Apoptosis-Inducing Anticancer Compounds.', 'Molecular mechanisms of docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Targeting mTOR Complex 2 in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer with Acquired Docetaxel Resistance.', 'Extracellular Vesicles and Cell Pathways Involved in Cancer Chemoresistance.']"""

Thus, we sought to characterize the antibody landscape of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Experimental design:   Serum antibody epitope repertoire analysis (SERA) was performed on patient serum to identify tumor-specific neoepitopes. Somatic mutation-specific neoepitopes were investigated by associating serum epitope enrichment scores with whole-genome sequencing results from paired solid tumor metastasis biopsies and germline blood samples. A protein-based immunome-wide association study (PIWAS) was performed to identify significantly enriched epitopes, and candidate serum antibodies enriched in select patients were validated by ELISA profiling. A distinct cohort of patients with melanoma was evaluated to validate the top cancer-specific epitopes.  Results:   SERA was performed on 1,229 serum samples obtained from 72 men with mCRPC and 1,157 healthy control patients. Twenty-nine of 6,636 somatic mutations (0.44%) were associated with an antibody response specific to the mutated peptide. PIWAS analyses identified motifs in 11 proteins, including NY-ESO-1 and HERVK-113, as immunogenic in mCRPC, and ELISA confirmed serum antibody enrichment in candidate patients. Confirmatory PIWAS, Identifying Motifs Using Next-generation sequencing Experiments (IMUNE), and ELISA analyses performed on serum samples from 106 patients with melanoma similarly revealed enriched cancer-specific antibody responses to NY-ESO-1.

B7-H3 is overexpressed on many solid cancers, including prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, non-small cell lung cancer, and breast cancer. Overexpression of B7-H3 is associated with disease severity, risk of recurrence and reduced survival. In this article, we report the preclinical development of MGC018, an antibody-drug conjugate targeted against B7-H3. MGC018 is comprised of the cleavable linker-duocarmycin payload, valine-citrulline-seco duocarmycin hydroxybenzamide azaindole (vc-seco-DUBA), conjugated to an anti-B7-H3 humanized IgG1/kappa mAb through reduced interchain disulfides, with an average drug-to-antibody ratio of approximately 2.7. MGC018 exhibited cytotoxicity toward B7-H3-positive human tumor cell lines, and exhibited bystander killing of target-negative tumor cells when cocultured with B7-H3-positive tumor cells. MGC018 displayed potent antitumor activity in preclinical tumor models of breast, ovarian, and lung cancer, as well as melanoma. In addition, antitumor activity was observed toward patient-derived xenograft models of breast, prostate, and head and neck cancer displaying heterogeneous expression of B7-H3. Importantly, MGC018 exhibited a favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile in cynomolgus monkeys following repeat-dose administration. The antitumor activity observed preclinically with MGC018, together with the positive safety profile, provides evidence of a potentially favorable therapeutic index and supports the continued development of MGC018 for the treatment of solid cancers.

Sipuleucel-T induces T- and B-cell responses to prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), correlating to improved survival. The long-term impact of sipuleucel-T on tumor antigen-specific immunologic memory remains unknown, in particular, B-cell responses, as measured by antigen-specific antibody responses and B-cell receptor (BCR) sequences. To evaluate whether sipuleucel-T could induce long-term immunologic memory, we examined circulating B-cell responses before and after sipuleucel-T treatment in two groups of patients with mCRPC: those who had previously received sipuleucel-T (treated; median, 8.9 years since the previous treatment) versus those who had not (naïve). Before re-treatment, previously treated patients exhibited persistent antibody responses as well as more focused and convergent BCR repertoires with distinct V(D)J gene usage compared with naïve patients. After re-treatment, previously treated patients maintained high-frequency clones and developed more convergent BCRs at earlier time points unlike naïve patients. With the first sipuleucel-T infusion specifically, previously treated patients had less shuffling within the 100 most abundant baseline clones. In contrast, naïve patients exhibited great BCR turnover with a continued influx of new B-cell clones. Social network analysis showed that previously treated patients had more highly organized B-cell repertoires, consistent with greater clonal maturation. Higher treatment-induced BCR clonality correlated with longer survival for naïve patients. These results demonstrated the capacity of sipuleucel-T to induce long-term immune memory and lasting changes to the B-cell repertoire.""","""['Li Zhang', 'Harini Kandadi', 'Hai Yang', 'Jason Cham', 'Tao He', 'David Y Oh', 'Nadeem A Sheikh', 'Lawrence Fong']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Immunol Res""","""['Randomized phase II trial of sipuleucel-T immunotherapy preceded by sensitizing radiation therapy and sipuleucel-T alone in patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer.', 'Antigen-Specific CD8 Lytic Phenotype Induced by Sipuleucel-T in Hormone-Sensitive or Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer and Association with Overall Survival.', 'Pre-existing immune status associated with response to combination of sipuleucel-T and ipilimumab in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Targeted treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with sipuleucel-T immunotherapy.', 'Development of sipuleucel-T: autologous cellular immunotherapy for the treatment of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer.', 'Vaccinating against cancer: getting to prime time.', 'Anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody-resistant esophageal squamous cell carcinoma showing the abscopal effect: A case report with T-cell receptor/B-cell receptor repertoire analysis.', 'Combination Treatment with Sipuleucel-T and Abiraterone Acetate or Enzalutamide for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: STAMP and STRIDE Trials.', ""Modulation of myeloid and T cells in vivo by Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma."", 'A Bayesian network meta-analysis of comparison of cancer therapeutic vaccines for melanoma.']"""

Results:   Using triple quadruple liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, we performed lipidomics profiling of 367 lipids on a total 114 plasma samples from 30 patients with prostate cancer, 38 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and 46 male healthy controls to evaluate the lipids as potential biomarkers in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database was used to construct the potential mechanism pathway. After statistical analysis, five lipids were identified as a panel of potential biomarkers for the detection of prostate cancer between prostate cancer group and the BPH group; the sensitivity, specificity, and area under curve (AUC) of the combination of these five lipids were 73.3, 81.6%, and 0.800, respectively. We also identified another panel of five lipids in distinguishing between prostate cancer group and the control group with predictive values of sensitivity at 76.7%, specificity at 80.4%, and AUC at 0.836, respectively. The glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway of the selected lipids was considered as the target pathway.  Conclusions:   Our study indicated that the identified plasma lipid biomarkers have potential in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.""","""['Xiaoli Chen', 'Yong Zhu', 'Mayumi Jijiwa', 'Masaki Nasu', 'Junmei Ai', 'Shengming Dai', 'Bin Jiang', 'Jicai Zhang', 'Gang Huang', 'Youping Deng']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Med Inform Decis Mak""","""['Plasma lipidomics profiling identified lipid biomarkers in distinguishing early-stage breast cancer from benign lesions.', 'Identification of plasma lipid biomarkers for prostate cancer by lipidomics and bioinformatics.', 'Prostate Cancer Associated Lipid Signatures in Serum Studied by ESI-Tandem Mass Spectrometryas Potential New Biomarkers.', 'Diagnostic Value of Circulating miR-324 for Prostate Cancer.', 'Unravelling Prostate Cancer Heterogeneity Using Spatial Approaches to Lipidomics and Transcriptomics.', 'Lipid Biomarkers in Liquid Biopsies: Novel Opportunities for Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Alteration of Lipid Metabolism in Prostate Cancer: Multifaceted Oncologic Implications.', ""Role of Lipids and Lipid Metabolism in Prostate Cancer Progression and the Tumor's Immune Environment."", 'Circulating metabolite biomarkers: a game changer in the human prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Metabolic Phenotyping in Prostate Cancer Using Multi-Omics Approaches.']"""

Material and methods:   Patients treated with 15 Gy HDR-BT followed by EBRT were retrospectively evaluated for development of urinary retention and hematuria requiring catheterization in the first 30 days post procedure. Clinical characteristics and treatment details were obtained and used as independent variables under study. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis were used to determine predictors of post brachytherapy complications and a classification tree for risk of urinary retention was created using recursive partitioning analysis (RPA).  Results:   A total of 425 patients treated with 15 Gy HDR-BT were included in this analysis. 27 patients (6.3%) required catheter placement due to acute urinary retention and thirteen other patients (3%) developed hematuria requiring urinary catheter insertion ± continuous bladder irrigation. Number of needles, prostate volume and prior use of ADT, alpha-blockers or 5α-reductase inhibitors were statistically associated with urinary retention in the univariable logistic regression analysis. In multivariable analysis, prostate volume, previous use of alpha-blocker, and use of ADT remained significant. In the RPA, populations were identified in which the rate of urinary retention ranged from 2% to 50% depending on presence of one or more of these risk factors.  Conclusion:   The overall rate of acute urinary complications post HDR brachytherapy is low, but the individual risk of urinary retention can increase depending on the number of risk factors present.

Labile heme and Hx levels are inversely correlated in the plasma of patients with prostate cancer (PCa). Further, low expression of Hx in PCa biopsies characterizes poorly differentiated tumors and correlates with earlier time to relapse. Significantly, heme promotes tumor growth and metastases in an orthotopic murine model of PCa, with the most aggressive phenotype detected in mice lacking Hx. Mechanistically, labile heme accumulates in the nucleus and modulates specific gene expression via interacting with guanine quadruplex (G4) DNA structures to promote PCa growth. We identify c-MYC as a heme:G4-regulated gene and a major player in heme-driven cancer progression.

New types of hormonal (androgen receptor targeted, ARTA) agents are being used in an increasingly early line. Chemotherapy (CT) is the first choice in case of metastatic, hormone-sensitive disease especially in high volume cases that are causing symptoms or visceral crisis. CT is otherwise applied after ARTA. We have little but encouraging data about the early, sequential use of ARTAs with different mechanisms of action.

The DKI parameters, namely apparent diffusion for non-Gaussian distribution (Dapp) and apparent kurtosis coefficient (Kapp), were calculated by dedicated software using mono-exponential and diffusion kurtosis models for quantitation. The measurement was performed for a whole tumor after segmentation, and pathologic topographic maps or systemic biopsy results served as the reference standard for segmentation.

For a predefined subanalysis of all patients with comprehensive next-generation sequencing, 30 patients were grouped based on the presence of pathogenic aberrations in genes associated with DNA damage repair (DDR) or aggressive variant prostate cancer (AVPC). Fourteen patients (47%) were DDR deficient (DDRd), of which seven with inactivated BRCA2 (BRCA2mut). Six patients classified as AVPC. DDRd patients showed beneficial biochemical response to carboplatin, largely driven by all BRCA2mut patients having >50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline and objective radiographic response. In the wild-type BRCA2 subgroup, 35% had a >50% PSA decline (P = .006) and 16% radiographic response (P < .001). Median overall survival was 21 months for BRCA2mut patients vs 7 months (P = .041) for those with functional BRCA2. AVPC patients demonstrated comparable responses to non-AVPC, including a similar overall survival, despite the poor prognosis for this subgroup. In the scope of the registration of poly-(ADP)-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) for mCRPC, we provide initial insights on cross-resistance between PARPi and platinum compounds. By combining the literature and our study, we identified 18 patients who received both agents. In this cohort, only BRCA2mut patients treated with platinum first (n = 4), responded to both agents. We confirm that BRCA2 inactivation is associated with meaningful responses to carboplatin, suggesting a role for both PARPi and platinum-based chemotherapy in preselected mCRPC patients.""","""['Peter H J Slootbeek', 'Marleen L Duizer', 'Maarten J van der Doelen', 'Iris S H Kloots', 'Malou C P Kuppen', 'Hans M Westgeest', 'Carin A Uyl-de Groot', 'Samhita Pamidimarri Naga', 'Marjolijn J L Ligtenberg', 'Inge M van Oort', 'Winald R Gerritsen', 'Jack A Schalken', 'Leonie I Kroeze', 'Haiko J Bloemendal', 'Niven Mehra']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['The association between germline BRCA2 variants and sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy among men with metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Distinct Response to Platinum-Based Chemotherapy among Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Harboring Alterations in Genes Involved in Homologous Recombination.', 'Impact of mutations in homologous recombination repair genes on treatment outcomes for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Treatment of Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Are PARP Inhibitors Shifting the Paradigm?', 'DNA-Damage-Repair Gene Alterations in Genitourinary Malignancies.', 'Down-regulation of PSMD4 can attenuate autophagy, enhance the accumulation of intracellular ROS, and increase the sensitivity of epithelial ovarian cancer to carboplatin by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway.', 'Curcumin sensitizes carboplatin treatment in triple negative breast cancer through reactive oxygen species induced DNA repair pathway.', 'Impact of molecular tumour board discussion on targeted therapy allocation in advanced prostate cancer.', 'A Case-Based Clinical Approach to the Investigation, Management and Screening of Families with BRCA2 Related Prostate Cancer.', 'Effect of cisplatin on metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with BRCA2 mutation: A case report.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated 127 CRPC patients who underwent treatment with Ra-223. The patients were divided into three groups based on the types of dynamic changes of bone metastasis between diagnosis and just before Ra-223: (a) only known lesions; (b) de novo lesions; (c) new progressive lesions. We developed the risk assessment using predictive factors based on progression-free survival (PFS).  Results:   During the median follow-up period of 10.4 months, the median PFS in the only known lesions group was 11.3 months compared to 8.1 months in the de novo lesions group and 5.1 months in the new progressive lesions group (P < .001). In multivariate analysis, the type of the new progressive lesions in bone metastasis (HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.13-1.66, P = .003), performance status of >1 (HR 1.74, 95% CI 1.04-2.89, P = .034), PSA value of >100 ng/mL (HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.02-2.50, P = .043), and PSA doubling time (PSADT) of <3 months (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.11-2.03, P = .007) were independent unfavorable predictive factors for PFS. The risk assessment for PFS was highlighted when the type of dynamic changes of bone metastasis was combined with PSADT just before Ra-223 treatment.

However, the contribution of signaling pathways that lead to metabolic disorders and NE differentiation of prostate cancer remains unclear. In this study, we identified that ADT induced upregulation of the succinate-CoA ligase GDP-forming beta subunit (SUCLG2), which regulates succinate metabolism and NE differentiation of prostate cancer. We demonstrated a connection that upregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) signaling induced SUCLG2 expression in prostate cancer cells. The LIFR is upregulated by nuclear EGFR, which acts as a transcriptional regulator, directly binds to the LIFR promoter, and drives NE differentiation and glycolysis of prostate cancer. LIFR upregulation is associated with SUCLG2, which increased succinate synthesis and enzymatic activities of mitochondrial nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) in prostate cancer cells. Knockdown of SUCLG2 suppressed NE differentiation in cultured cells and reduced prostate tumor growth in a xenograft model. Analysis of prostate tissue samples showed increased intensity of nuclear EGFR associated with the LIFR and SUCLG2 in castration-resistant prostate cancer tumors.

Methods:   Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy were used to assay the roles of BCAS2 in the DSBs of PCa cells and apoptosis in Drosophila, respectively.

Results:   BCAS2 helped repair radiation-induced DSBs efficiently in both human PCa cells and Drosophila. BCAS2 enhanced both NHEJ and HR, possibly by interacting with NBS1, which involved the BCAS2 N-terminus as well as both the NBS1 N- and C-termini.

Assessment of hypofractionated RT in prostate and breast cancers is used as an illustrative example. Non-inferiority assessment of an experimental treatment versus an active comparator should rely on two elements: (1) an estimation of experimental treatment's effect versus the active comparator based on a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and (2) the value of an objective non-inferiority margin. This margin can be defined using the reported effect of active comparator and the percentage of the active comparator's effect that is desired to be preserved. Non-inferiority can then be assessed by comparing the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval of experimental treatment's effect to the value of the objective non-inferiority margin. Application to hypofractionated RT in breast cancer showed that hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (HWBI) appeared to be non-inferior to conventionally fractionated RT for local recurrence. This was not the case for accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). Concerning overall survival, non-inferiority could not be claimed for either HWBI or APBI.

Whether bariatric surgery can effectively alleviate LUTS in morbidly obese men is unknown. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of bariatric surgery in reducing the prevalence and severity of male LUTS in obese patients.  Methods:   This was a prospective observational study on consecutive morbidly obese men undergoing bariatric surgery. The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) was used to assess for LUTS before and at 1-3 years after surgery. The 3-year changes in IPSS, the changes in LUTS severity, and the factors associated with LUTS improvement were evaluated.  Results:   This study recruited 143 morbidly obese men (mean age 43.0 ± 10.4 years) undergoing sleeve gastrectomy (n = 89) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (n = 54). The rates of follow-up after surgery were 94.4% (n = 119/126) at 1 year, 90.6% (n = 96/106) at 2 years, and 81.2% (n = 69/85) at 3 years. After surgery, there was significant body mass index reduction from 39.1 ± 5.2 kg/m2 preoperatively to 30.1 ± 4.8 kg/m2 at 1 year and 31.5 ± 4.9 kg/m2 at 3 years (P < 0.001). There was significant reduction in IPSS total symptom score, quality of life score, frequency score, and nocturia score (P < 0.05). The prevalence of moderate to severe LUTS reduced from 35.0% (29.4% moderate; 5.6% severe) preoperatively to 21.8% (19.3% moderate; 2.5% severe) at 1 year and 30.4% (24.6% moderate; 5.8% severe) at 3 years (P < 0.001). LUTS improvement was significantly associated with body fat percentage reduction (P = 0.012) and was not associated with weight loss or improvement of metabolic parameters.  Conclusions:   Bariatric surgery was an effective and durable intervention for alleviating the prevalence and severity of LUTS in morbidly obese men for up to 3 years.""","""['Shirley Yuk-Wah Liu', 'Chi Hang Yee', 'Peter Ka-Fung Chiu', 'Candice Chuen-Hing Lam', 'Simon Kin-Hung Wong', 'Enders Kwok-Wai Ng', 'Chi Fai Ng']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Early Effect of Bariatric Surgery on Urogenital Function in Morbidly Obese Men.', 'Effects of bariatric surgery on male lower urinary tract symptoms and sexual function.', 'Improvement of voiding characteristics in morbidly obese women after bariatric surgery: A single-center study with a 1-year follow-up.', 'Bariatric surgery in morbidly obese patients with inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review.', 'Bariatric surgery in morbidly obese adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Effects of different diets used to induce obesity/metabolic syndrome on bladder function in rats.', 'Beneficial Effects of the Very-Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet on the Symptoms of Male Accessory Gland Inflammation.']"""

Objective:   To assess functional and oncological results of RP in PCa patients who received HoLEP for BPO previously in a contemporary multi-institutional cohort.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 95 patients who underwent RP between 2011 and 2019 and had a history of HoLEP were identified in two institutions. Functional as well as oncological follow-up was prospectively assessed and retrospectively analyzed.  Intervention:   RP following HoLEP compared with RP without previous transurethral surgery.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Patients with complete follow-up data were matched with individuals with no history of BPO surgery using propensity score matching. Complications were assessed using the Clavien-Dindo scale.  Results and limitations:   The median follow-up was 50.5 mo. We found no significant impact of previous HoLEP on positive surgical margin rate (14.0% [HoLEP] vs 18.8% [no HoLEP], p = 0.06) and biochemical recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32-1.70, p = 0.4). Patients with a history of HoLEP had increased 1-yr urinary incontinence rates after RP. After adjusting for confounders, no significant impact of previous HoLEP was found (odds ratio [OR] 0.87, 95% CI 0.74-1.01; p = 0.07). Previous HoLEP did not hamper 1-yr erectile function recovery (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.05-1.43; p = 0.01). Limitations include retrospective design and small sample size.  Conclusions:   RP after previous HoLEP is surgically feasible, with low complication rates and no negative impact on biochemical recurrence-free survival.

Objective:   To test the efficacy of stage-specific chemotherapy for MCUB.  Design, setting, and participants:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry (2001-2016), we identified patients with MCUB and pure urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder (UCUB) of all stages.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and multivariate Cox regression models were used to determine cancer-specific mortality (CSM) in addition to power analyses.  Results and limitations:   Of 210 491 patients of all stages, 518 (0.2%) harboured MCUB versus 209 973 (99.8%) UCUB. Stage at presentation was invariably higher in MCUB than in UCUB patients. Of the MCUB patients, 223 (43.1%) received chemotherapy versus 42 921 (20.4%) of the UCUB patients. In MCUB patients, chemotherapy improved CSM-free survival significantly in metastatic stage (hazard ratio [HR] 0.36, p = 0.04). Longer median CSM-free survival was also associated with chemotherapy use in addition to radical cystectomy (RC) versus RC alone in non-organ-confined MCUB (HR 0.69, p = 0.2). Additional power analyses revealed an underpowered comparison. Finally, no CSM difference was recorded in organ-confined MCUB according to the use of chemotherapy in addition to RC versus RC alone (HR 0.98, p = 1).  Conclusions:   Stage at presentation was invariably higher in MCUB than in UCUB patients. Very important CSM reduction was associated with chemotherapy use in metastatic MCUB. A promising protective effect of perioperative chemotherapy might also be applicable to non-organ-confined MCUB, but without sufficient statistical power. Conversely, no association was recorded in organ-confined MCUB.  Patient summary:   Patients with micropapillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder (MCUB) present in higher tumour stages than those with urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder.

We tested the association between preoperative serum De Ritis ratio (DRR, Aspartate Aminotransferase/Alanine Aminotransferase) and overall survival (OS) as well as cancer-specific survival (CSS) in mRCC patients treated with CN.  Material and methods:   mRCC patients treated with CN at different institutions were included. After assessing for the optimal pretreatment DRR cut-off value, we found 1.2 to have the maximum Youden index value. The overall population was therefore divided into 2 DRR groups using this cut-off (low, <1.2 vs. high, ≥1.2). Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses tested the association between DRR and OS as well as CSS. The discrimination of the model was evaluated with the Harrel's concordance index (C-index). The clinical value of the DRR was evaluated with decision curve analysis.  Results:   Among 613 mRCC patients, 239 (39%) patients had a DRR ≥1.2. Median follow-up was 31 (IQR 16-58) months.

Ultrasound provides detailed real-time anatomic information, including blood flow measurements and tissue elasticity. The latter is provided through various techniques including shear wave elastography (SWE). SWE is increasingly used in many areas of medicine, especially in detection and diagnosis of breast, thyroid and prostate cancers and liver disease. More recently, SWE has found application in gynaecology and obstetrics. This method mimics manual palpation, revealing the elastic properties of soft biological tissues. Despite its rising potential and expanding clinical interest in its use in obstetrics and gynaecology (such as for assessment of cervical ripening or organ development and structure during pregnancy), its effects on and potential risks to the developing fetus remain unknown. Risks should be evaluated by regulatory bodies before recommendations are made on the use of SWE. Because ultrasound is known to produce thermal and mechanical effects, this study measured the temperature increase caused by B-mode, pulse Doppler (PD) and SWE, using an instrumented phantom with 11 embedded thermocouples. Experiments were performed with an Aixplorer diagnostic ultrasound system (Supersonic Imagine, Aix-en-Provence, France). As expected, the greatest heating was detected by the thermocouple closest to the surface in contact with the transducer (2.9°C for SWE, 1.2°C for PD, 0.7°C for B-mode after 380-s excitation). Both conduction from the transducer face and direct heating owing to ultrasound waves contribute to temperature increase in the phantom with SWE associated with a larger temperature increase than PD and B-mode. This article offers a methodological approach and reference data for future safety studies, as well as initial recommendations about SWE safety in obstetrics and gynaecology.""","""['Maha Issaoui', 'Piero Miloro', 'Xavier Balandraud', 'Ian Rivens', 'Michel Grédiac', 'Benoit Blaysat', 'Lemlih Ouchchane', 'Amélie Delabaere', 'Marie-Pierre Sauvant-Rochat', 'Didier Lemery']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Ultrasound Med Biol""","""['Ultrasound Shear Wave Elastography for Liver Disease.

So it becomes obligatory to assess the costs and benefits of a new technology, before defining its clinical value. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) as compared to 2-dimensional radiotherapy (2-DRT) and 3-dimensional radiotherapy (3D-CRT) for treating head and neck cancers (HNC) in India. The cost-effectiveness of 3-DCRT as compared to 2-DRT was also estimated.  Methods:   A probabilistic Markov model was designed. Using a disaggregated societal perspective, lifetime study horizon and 3 percent discount rate, future costs and health outcomes were compared for a cohort of 1000 patients treated with any of the three radiation techniques. Data on health system cost, out of pocket expenditure, and quality of life was assessed through primary data collected from a large tertiary care public sector hospital in India. Data on xerostomia rates following each of the radiation techniques was extracted from the existing randomized controlled trials.  Results:   IMRT incurs an incremental cost of $7,072 (2,932-13,258) and $5,164 (463-10,954) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained compared to 2-DRT and 3D-CRT, respectively. Further, 3D-CRT as compared to 2-DRT requires an incremental cost of $8,946 (1,996-19,313) per QALY gained.  Conclusion:   Both IMRT and 3D-CRT are not cost-effective at 1 times GDP per capita for treating HNC in India.

Patients and methods:   Data from 1299 patients with UCB and 276 with UTUC were obtained from multicentric collaborations. The association of disease location (UCB vs UTUC) with pathological complete response (pCR, defined as a post-treatment pathological stage ypT0N0) and pathological objective response (pOR, defined as ypT0-Ta-Tis-T1N0) after NAC was evaluated using logistic regression analyses. The association with overall (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) was evaluated using Cox regression analyses.  Results:   A pCR was found in 250 (19.2%) patients with UCB and in 23 (8.3%) with UTUC (P < 0.01). A pOR was found in 523 (40.3%) patients with UCB and in 133 (48.2%) with UTUC (P = 0.02). On multivariable logistic regression analysis, patients with UTUC were less likely to have a pCR (odds ratio [OR] 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.27-0.70; P < 0.01) and more likely to have a pOR (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.89-2.08; P < 0.01). On univariable Cox regression analyses, UTUC was associated with better OS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.80, 95% CI 0.64-0.99, P = 0.04) and CSS (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49-0.83; P < 0.01). On multivariable Cox regression analyses, UTUC remained associated with CSS (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.45-0.82; P < 0.01), but not with OS.

Material and methods:   During the first 5 days of treatment, and then once a week, a Kv CBCT was performed, compared with the simulation CT and adjusted the displacements, to determine the inter-fraction errors. Immediately after radiation therapy, another CBCT was performed (for intra-fraction errors). With these data, the X, R position control charts have been made. The patients, not maintained the deviations within the charts control limits, were called ""anomalies"". Then, we compared the deviations and margins calculated with the van Herk expression for all patients and for those without anomalies.  Results:   The margins determined show appreciable differences if there were calculated for the total set of patients or for the set of them without anomalies in the control charts. For the overall set of patients, the lateral, longitudinal, and vertical margins were 0.45 cm, 0.52 cm, 0.56 cm, while for the set of patients without anomalies were 0.29 cm, 0.35 cm, and 0.38 cm.  Conclusions:   The use of control charts allows tracking geometric deviations both inter and intra-fraction, variability real-time control and to detect situations in which it can change for non-random reasons, and require immediate investigation.

Methods and materials:   Seventeen patients at a major academic cancer center who underwent MRI-assisted radiosurgery (MARS) LDR prostate cancer brachytherapy were imaged with moderate, high, or very high spatial resolution fully bSSFP MRIs without using an ERC. Between 1 and 3 signal averages (NEX) were acquired with acceleration factors (R) between 1 and 2, with the goal of keeping scan times between 4 and 6 minutes. Acquisitions with R >1 were reconstructed with parallel imaging and compressed sensing (PICS) algorithms. Radioactive seeds were identified by 3 medical dosimetrists. Additionally, some of the MRI techniques were implemented and tested at a community hospital; 3 patients underwent MARS LDR prostate brachytherapy and were imaged without an ERC.  Results:   Increasing the in-plane spatial resolution mitigated partial volume artifacts and improved overall seed and seed marker visualization at the expense of reduced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The reduced SNR as a result of imaging at higher spatial resolution and without an ERC was partially compensated for by the multi-NEX acquisitions enabled by PICS. Resultant image quality was superior to the current clinical standard. All 3 dosimetrists achieved near-perfect precision and recall for seed identification in the 17 patients. The 3 postimplant MRIs acquired at the community hospital were sufficient to identify 208 out of 211 seeds implanted without reference to computed tomography (CT).  Conclusions:   Acquiring postimplant prostate brachytherapy MRI without an ERC has several advantages including better patient tolerance, lower costs, higher clinical throughput, and widespread access to precision LDR prostate brachytherapy. This prospective study confirms that the use of an ERC can be circumvented with fully bSSFP and advanced MRI scan techniques in a major academic cancer center and community hospital, potentially enabling postimplant assessment of MARS LDR prostate brachytherapy without CT.""","""['Jeremiah W Sanders', 'Aradhana M Venkatesan', 'Chad A Levitt', 'Tharakeswara Bathala', 'Rajat J Kudchadker', 'Chad Tang', 'Teresa L Bruno', 'Christine Starks', 'Edwin Santiago', 'Michelle Wells', 'Carl P Weaver', 'Jingfei Ma', 'Steven J Frank']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Erratum to: Sanders JW, Venkatesan AM, Levitt CA, et al.

The model, building on the one by Rutter and Kuang, includes different types of immune cells and interactions and is parameterized on available data. Our results show that the vaccine has only a very limited effect on PCa, while repeated treatments with ipilimumab appear potentially capable of controlling and even eradicating an androgen-independent prostate cancer. From a mathematical analysis of a simplified model, it seems likely that, under continuous administration of ipilimumab, the system lies in a bistable situation where both the no-tumor equilibrium and the high-tumor equilibrium are attractive.

Increasing evidence suggests that large intervening ncRNAs regulate key pathways in cancer genesis and metastasis. Among the most characterized lncRNAs, homeobox (HOX) transcript antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR) acts as an oncogenic molecule in different cancer cells, and thus its expression level serves as a potential biomarker for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in several human cancers, such as breast, prostate, liver and ovarian cancer. This paper reports a simple and sensitive sensor platform for the detection of HOTAIR. Extracted HOTAIR sequences from ovarian cancer cells and plasma samples derived from ovarian cancer patients were magnetically isolated and purified, followed by a sandwich hybridization event at a screen-printed gold electrode. This event was monitored by amperometry using the hydrogen peroxide/horseradish peroxidase/hydroquinone (H2O2/HRP/HQ) system. The catalytic enhancement of the amperometric signal enabled our assay to achieve a detection limit of 1.0 fM with a good inter-assay reproducibility (relative standard deviation (%RSD) = < 5.0%, n = 3). The method was used for the analysis of specific HOTAIR in cell line and a small cohort of plasma samples derived from patients with ovarian cancer. The analytical performance of the method was also demonstrated using a standard RT-qPCR. We believe that the proof of the concept assay demonstrated here could be a cost-effective alternative platform for screening cancer-related lncRNAs in routine clinical settings.""","""['Narshone Soda', 'Muhammad Umer', 'Surasak Kasetsirikul', 'Carlos Salomon', 'Richard Kline', 'Nam-Trung Nguyen', 'Bernd H A Rehm', 'Muhammad J A Shiddiky']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Anal Chim Acta""","""['An Interfacial Affinity Interaction-Based Method for Detecting HOTAIR lncRNA in Cancer Plasma Samples.', 'PCR-Free Detection of Long Non-Coding HOTAIR RNA in Ovarian Cancer Cell Lines and Plasma Samples.', 'Naked-eye and electrochemical detection of isothermally amplified HOTAIR long non-coding RNA.', 'Large intervening non-coding RNA HOTAIR is an indicator of poor prognosis and a therapeutic target in human cancers.', 'Targeting long non-coding RNAs in cancers: progress and prospects.', 'An Interfacial Affinity Interaction-Based Method for Detecting HOTAIR lncRNA in Cancer Plasma Samples.', 'Non-Coding RNA-Based Biosensors for Early Detection of Liver Cancer.', 'The establishment of an immunosensor for the detection of SPOP.']"""

About 65 % of all bone metastases come from the breast cancer in females, and from the prostatic carcinoma in males. A probable diagnostic pitfall may be encountered during the process of decalcification of the bone metastases specimens. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic utility of NKX3.1 and HOXB13 and compare them with the traditionally used PSA for the detection of prostatic origin of bone metastases.  Material and methods:   We analyzed 41 tissue specimens of bone metastases originating from prostatic carcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining of NKX3.1, HOXB13 and PSA was done with evaluation of their differential expression.  Results:   NKX3.1, HOXB 13 and PSA were expressed in (41/41), (39/41) and (25/41) respectively of the analyzed cases. On comparing NKX3.1 and HOXB13 positive staining, there was a statistically significant difference (P = 0.000). In addition, the frequency of positive NKX3.1 expression in decalcified bone biopsies of metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma is statistically higher than that of PSA immunostaining (P = 0.000). We found a statistically significant difference between HOXB13 and PSA positive immunostaining (P = 0.01).  Conclusion:   This study demonstrates that NKX3.1 and HOXB13 are more sensitive markers than PSA for the detection of prostate carcinoma metastatic to the bone following the decalcification process.

Secondary outcomes included objectively assessed PA, quality of life, body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, cognitive functioning, and physical function. Twenty-six prostate cancer survivors were randomized to a 12-week supervised PA program plus standard exercise counseling or a 12-week supervised PA plus behavioral counseling based on the Multi-Process Action Control framework. Feasibility was determined through enrolment rate, measurement completion rate, loss-to-follow-up, adherence to the intervention, adverse events, and program evaluation items assessing burden and satisfaction. Of the 26 prostate cancer survivors enrolled (Mage = 65.6 ± 6.8), 96% completed the intervention. Measurement completion rates for the study measures were 88.5%. Adherence to the supervised PA sessions was 92% (completed 11/12 supervised PA sessions) and 100% (completed 12/12 supervised PA sessions) in the PA + EC and PA + BC group, respectively. Adherence to the home-based PA sessions was 70% (completed 7/10 home-based sessions) and 90% (completed 9/10 home-based sessions) in the PA + EC and PA + BC group, respectively. Overall, prostate cancer survivors were highly satisfied with the intervention components and found it rewarding, useful for research helping others, and useful for them personally. The patterns in the secondary outcomes were consistent with a positive impact of the intervention, favoring the PA + BC group. Preliminary evidence suggests that adding behavioral counseling to supervised PA in prostate cancer survivors may be feasible and result in better adherence to PA compared to exercise counseling alone, although additional refinement is needed. A combination of supervised and home-based PA may be feasible for behavior change in the self-management of prostate cancer.

Docetaxel (D) 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks has been the standard first line chemotherapy for CRPC. Encapsulation of doxorubicin in polyethylene glycol-coated liposomes (PLD) was developed to enhance the safety and efficacy of conventional doxorubicin. We hypothesize that the combination of weekly low dose-D and PLD would result in a high response rate and low toxicity. Eligibility criteria included metastatic progressive CRPC, no prior D or PLD and good organ function. After a short phase I with no dose-limiting toxicity, D 30 mg/m2 was administered on days 1, 8 and 15; and PLD 30 mg/m2 on day 1 only, every 28 days. Thirty-seven patients were enrolled. The PSA response rate was 53%. Twenty-two subjects had measurable disease; one (5%) achieved complete response, five (23%) partial response, and twelve (54%) stable disease. Twenty-seven patients (73%) manifested pain relief. The median time to progression was 3.7 months for all patients and 7.9 months for responders. Median overall survival was 16.3 months. Grade 4 neutropenia without infection and anemia occurred in 1 patient each. Grade 3 treatment-related toxicities included: 15% fatigue; 9% neutropenia, anemia and nausea; 6% dehydration and hand-foot syndrome; and 3% infection, febrile neutropenia, thrombosis, stomatitis, headache, vomiting, weight loss and weakness. In this non-comparative study D-PLD demonstrated a higher activity than previously reported with single agent D with favorable side effect profile. A phase 3 study would be needed to evaluate the true benefit of this combination.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00456989.""","""['Damian A Laber', 'Jennifer Eatrides', 'Michael V Jaglal', 'Mintallah Haider', 'Nathan Visweshwar', 'Ankita Patel']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Oncol""","""['Biweekly Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin (Caelyx) in Heavily Pretreated Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Phase 2 Study.', 'Phase I study on pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in combination with docetaxel for patients with platinum-resistant or partially platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian cancer: The Kansai Clinical Oncology Group study.', 'Docetaxel and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin combination as first-line therapy for metastatic breast cancer patients: results of the phase II GINECO trial CAPYTTOLE.', 'Custirsen (OGX-011) combined with cabazitaxel and prednisone versus cabazitaxel and prednisone alone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel (AFFINITY): a randomised, open-label, international, phase 3 trial.', 'Salvage chemotherapy with docetaxel and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in pretreated patients with platinum- and taxane-sensitive ovarian cancer: a multicenter phase II trial of the Hellenic Oncology Research Group (HORG).', 'Pharmacological Small Molecules against Prostate Cancer by Enhancing Function of Death Receptor 5.', 'Use of paclitaxel carried in lipid core nanoparticles in patients with late-stage solid cancers with bone metastases: Lack of toxicity and therapeutic benefits.', 'Role of noncoding RNA in drug resistance of prostate cancer.', 'Current Perspectives on Taxanes: Focus on Their Bioactivity, Delivery and Combination Therapy.']"""

Available pharmaceutical ADTs include gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists and antagonists. Here, real-world data are presented from the UK general practitioner Optimum Patient Care Research Database. The study investigated the hypothesis that GnRH antagonists have lower cardiac event rates than GnRH agonists.  Methods:   The incidence of cardiac events following initiation of GnRH antagonist or agonist therapy was investigated in a population-based cohort study conducted in UK primary care between 2010 and 2017.  Results:   Analysis of real-world data from the UK primary care setting showed that relative risk of experiencing cardiac events was significantly lower with degarelix, a GnRH antagonist, compared with GnRH agonists (risk ratio: 0.39 [95% confidence interval 0.191, 0.799]; p = 0.01). Patients that received degarelix as first-line treatment switched treatment more frequently (33.7%), often to a GnRH agonist, than those who initiated treatment with a GnRH agonist (6.7-18.6%).  Conclusion:   Screening for known or underlying vascular disease and identifying those at high risk of a cardiac event is important for risk mitigation in patients with prostate cancer receiving hormone therapy. The GnRH antagonist degarelix conferred a significantly lower risk of cardiac events than GnRH agonists. Prior to treatment, patients should be stratified based on level of cardiovascular (CV) risk, and appropriate lifestyle, and pharmacological interventions to mitigate CV risk should be recommended. CV risk factors and patient response to the intervention should be monitored at regular intervals.""","""['Patrick Davey', 'Mike G Kirby']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Correction to: Cardiovascular risk profiles of GnRH agonists and antagonists: real-world analysis from UK general practice.', 'Adverse cardiovascular effect following gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist versus GnRH agonist for prostate cancer treatment: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist associated with lower cardiovascular risk compared with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist in prostate cancer: A nationwide cohort and in vitro study.', 'Cardiovascular risk of androgen deprivation therapy for\xa0treatment of hormone-dependent prostate cancer : Differences\xa0between GnRH antagonists and GnRH agonists.', 'The role of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonists in the treatment of patients with advanced hormone-dependent prostate cancer in the UK.', 'Differential Impact of Gonadotropin-releasing Hormone Antagonist Versus Agonist on Clinical Safety and Oncologic Outcomes on Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.', 'Review of Cardiovascular Risk of Androgen Deprivation Therapy and the Influence of Race in Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'Data-Resource Profile: United Kingdom Optimum Patient Care Research Database.', 'Metabolic Acidosis Results in Sexually Dimorphic Response in the Heart Tissue.', 'Safety, Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Evaluation of Teverelix for the Treatment of Hormone-Sensitive Advanced Prostate Cancer: Phase 2 Loading-Dose-Finding Studies.', 'Adverse cardiovascular effect following gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist versus GnRH agonist for prostate cancer treatment: A systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

However, during the optimization step, a rapid dose calculation algorithm is required, which reduces its accuracy and its representation of the objective function space. Monte Carlo (MC) routines, considered the gold standard in accuracy, are currently too slow for practical comprehensive VMAT optimization. Therefore, we propose a novel approach called enhanced optimization (EO), which employs the TPS VMAT plan as a starting point, and applies small perturbations to nudge the solution closer to a true objective minimum. The perturbations consist of beamlet dose matrices, calculated using MC routines on a distributed-computing framework.  Methods:   DICOM files for clinical VMAT plans files are exported from the TPS and used to generate input files for the EGSnrc MC toolkit. Beamlet doses are calculated using the MC routines, each corresponding to a single multileaf collimator leaf from a single control point traveling 0.5 cm in or out of the field. A typical VMAT plan requires 5000 to 10 000 beamlets, which may be calculated overnight. This results in a ternary-valued objective function, which may use the same clinical objectives as the original VMAT plan. A simple greedy search algorithm is applied to minimize this function and determine the optimal set of ternary variables. The resulting modified control point parameters are imported into the TPS to calculate the final, deliverable dose, and to compare the EO plan with the original. EO was evaluated retrospectively on seven VMAT plans (two adult brain, one pediatric brain, two head and neck, and two prostate). Additionally, the use of stricter objectives was investigated for two of the cases: the left cochlea planning organ at risk (OAR) volume objective for the pediatric brain case, and the rectum objective for a prostate case.  Results:   EO produced improved objective scores (by 6% to 60%) and dose-volume histograms (DVH) for the brain plans and the head and neck plans. For each of these plans, the target dose minimum and homogeneity were preserved, while one or more of the OAR DVH's was reduced. Although EO also reduced the objective scores for the prostate plans (by 46% and 79%), their absolute score and DVH improvements were not substantial. The stricter objective on the pediatric brain case resulted in lower dose to the OAR without compromising the target dose. However, the rectum dose in the prostate case could not be improved without reducing dose homogeneity to the planning target volume, suggesting that VMAT prostate cases may already be highly optimized by the TPS.  Conclusion:   We have developed a novel approach to improving the dose distribution of VMAT plans, which relies on MC calculations to provide small modifications to the control points. This method may be particularly useful for complex treatments in which a certain OAR is of concern and it is difficult for the treatment planner to obtain an acceptable solution with the TPS. Further development will reduce the beamlet computation time and result in more sophisticated EO treatment planning methods.""","""['Joshua Mathews', 'Samuel B French', 'Stephen Bhagroo', 'Ankit Pant', 'Daryl P Nazareth']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Treatment planning for radiotherapy with very high-energy electron beams and comparison of VHEE and VMAT plans.', 'Feasibility of a GATE Monte Carlo platform in a clinical pretreatment QA system for VMAT treatment plans using TrueBeam with an HD120 multileaf collimator.', 'Secondary monitor unit calculations for VMAT using parallelized Monte Carlo simulations.', 'Influence of segment width on plan quality for volumetric modulated arc based stereotactic body radiotherapy.', 'Artificial intelligence applications in intensity modulated radiation treatment planning: an overview.']"""

Methods:   In this prospective cohort study, men who underwent active, non-hormonal treatment completed baseline (N = 558) and 6-month follow-up (N = 387) questionnaires. Theory of planned behaviour (TPB) constructs (sexual help-seeking intention, perceived behavioural control (PBC), subjective norm, attitude), masculine values (e.g., sexual importance/priority, emotional self-reliance), sex life and functioning, sexual supportive care needs, distress (anxiety, depression), and sexual help-seeking behaviour were assessed.  Results:   Most men (M age = 64.6 years; M years post-diagnosis = 4.0) received prostatectomy (93%), reported severe erectile dysfunction (52%), ≥ 1 unmet sexual care need (66%), and sought help from a doctor (baseline 52%, follow-up 42%). Sexual care needs were significantly associated with poorer erectile function, reduced satisfaction with sex-life, valuing sex as important/integral to identity (masculine values), and increased depression (p ≤ 0.001). Sexual help-seeking intentions were significantly associated with valuing sex as important/integral to identity, recent help-seeking, greater confidence/control, perceiving support from important others, and positive attitudes, for sexual help-seeking (p < 0.001). Significant predictors of sexual help-seeking (follow-up) were baseline intentions, recent help-seeking (p < 0.001), and increased anxiety (p < 0.05).  Conclusions:   Men's unmet sexual care needs, sexual help-seeking intentions, and behaviour appear driven by the importance/value attributed to sex, distress, positive feelings, support from others, and confidence for help-seeking. Psychosocial providers are well-placed to address men's concerns, yet few sought their assistance.

Molecular analysis facilitates detection of small-volume LN metastases with higher sensitivity than histopathology. We aimed to prospectively evaluate six candidate gene markers for detection of pelvic LN metastases and to determine their ability to predict biochemical recurrence-free survival (bRFS) in patients treated with RP.  Methods:   The expression of kallikrein 2, 3, and 4 (KLK2, KLK3, and KLK4), prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 8 (TRPM8) was assessed using qPCR. We analyzed LNs from 111 patients (intermediate PC, n = 32 (29%); high-risk PC, n = 79 (71%)) who underwent RP and extended pelvic lymph-node dissection without neoadjuvant treatment.  Results:   Overall, 2411 LNs were examined by molecular and histopathologic examination. Histopathology detected 69 LN metastases in 28 (25%) patients. KLK2 and KLK3 diagnostically performed best and classified all pN1-patients correctly as molecular node-positive (molN1/pN1). The concordance on LN level was best for KLK3 (96%). KLK2, KLK3, KLK4, PSMA, TMPRSS2, and TRPM8 reclassified 27 (24%), 32 (29%), 29 (26%), 8 (7%), 13 (12%), and 23 (21%) pN0-patients, respectively, as node-positive (pN0/molN1). On multivariable cox regression analysis molecular LN status (molN1 vs. molN0) using KLK3 (HR 4.0, p = 0.04) and TMPRSS2 (HR 5.1, p = 0.02) were independent predictors of bRFS. Median bRFS was shorter in patients with only molecular positive LNs (molN1/pN0) for KLK3 (24 months, p = 0.001) and for TMPRSS2 (12 months, p < 0.001) compared to patients with negative nodes (molN0/pN0) (median bRFS not reached).  Conclusions:   For diagnostic purposes, KLK3 showed highest concordance with histopathology for detection of LN metastases in PC patients undergoing RP. For prognostic purposes, KLK3 and TMPRSS2 expression were superior to histopathologic LN status and other transcripts tested for molecular LN status.

However, the detailed mechanisms of how ARv7 expression is regulated and whether it also needs other factors to induce maximal Enz resistance remain unclear. Here, we identified a microRNA, miR-361-3p, whose expression is lower in patients with recurrent PCa, could function via binding to the 3'UTR of ARv7, but not the wild type of AR, to suppress its expression to increase the Enz sensitivity. Importantly, we found that miR-361-3p could also bind to the 3'UTR of MAP kinase-interacting serine/threonine kinase 2 (MKNK2) to suppress its expression to further increase the Enz sensitivity. In turn, the increased Enz can then function via a feedback mechanism through altering the HIF-2α/VEGFA signaling to suppress the expression of miR-361-3p under hypoxia conditions. Preclinical studies using an in vivo mouse model with orthotopically xenografted CWR22Rv1 cells demonstrated that combining the Enz with the small molecule miR-361-3p would result in better suppression of the Enz-resistant PCa tumor progression. Together, these preclinical studies demonstrate that miR-361-3p can function via suppressing the expression of ARv7 and MKNK2 to maximally increase the Enz sensitivity, and targeting these newly identified Enz/miR-361-3p/ARv7 and/or Enz/miR-361-3p/MKNK2 signals with small molecules may help in the development of novel therapies to better suppress the CRPC in patients that already have developed the Enz resistance.""","""['Bianjiang Liu#', 'Yin Sun#', 'Min Tang', 'Chao Liang', 'Chi-Ping Huang', 'Yuanjie Niu', 'Zengjun Wang', 'Chawnshang Chang']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Preclinical study using circular RNA 17 and micro RNA 181c-5p to suppress the enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer progression.', 'Preclinical studies using cisplatin/carboplatin to restore the Enzalutamide sensitivity via degrading the androgen receptor splicing variant 7 (ARv7) to further suppress Enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer.', 'Natural killer cells suppress enzalutamide resistance and cell invasion in the castration resistant prostate cancer via targeting the androgen receptor splicing variant 7 (ARv7).', 'Enzalutamide: targeting the androgen signalling pathway in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Enzalutamide after docetaxel and abiraterone acetate treatment in prostate cancer: a pooled analysis of 10 case series.', 'The functional role of circular RNAs in the pathogenesis of retinoblastoma: a new potential biomarker and therapeutic target?', 'Long noncoding RNA BBOX1-AS1 promotes the progression of gastric cancer by regulating the miR-361-3p/Mucin 13 signaling axis.', 'LncRNA BBOX1-AS1 Contributes to the Progression of Esophageal Carcinoma by Targeting the miR-361-3p/COL5A1 Axis.', 'Role of lncRNA MIAT/miR-361-3p/CCAR2 in prostate cancer cells.', 'Adaptation to Hypoxia May Promote Therapeutic Resistance to Androgen Receptor Inhibition in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.']"""

We examined whether leisure-time moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (LTPA) and television (TV) viewing were associated with life expectancy cancer-free.  Methods:   We included 14,508 participants without a cancer history from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. We used multistate survival models to separately examine associations of LTPA (no LTPA, <median, ≥median) and TV viewing (seldom/never, sometimes, often/very often) with life expectancy cancer-free at age 50 from invasive colorectal, lung, prostate, and postmenopausal breast cancer. Models were adjusted for age, gender, race, ARIC center, education, smoking, and alcohol intake.  Results:   Compared with no LTPA, participants who engaged in LTPA ≥median had a greater life expectancy cancer-free from colorectal [men-2.2 years (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.7-2.7), women-2.3 years (95% CI, 1.7-2.8)], lung [men-2.1 years (95% CI, 1.5-2.6), women-2.1 years (95% CI, 1.6-2.7)], prostate [1.5 years (95% CI, 0.8-2.2)], and postmenopausal breast cancer [2.4 years (95% CI, 1.4-3.3)]. Compared with watching TV often/very often, participants who seldom/never watched TV had a greater colorectal, lung, and postmenopausal breast cancer-free life expectancy of ∼1 year.  Conclusions:   Participating in LTPA was associated with longer life expectancy cancer-free from colorectal, lung, prostate, and postmenopausal breast cancer. Viewing less TV was associated with more years lived cancer-free from colorectal, lung, and postmenopausal breast cancer.

Objective:   To determine the effect of ADT combined with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to the prostate on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with primary bone mPCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   The HORRAD trial is a multicentre randomised controlled trial recruiting 432patients with primary bone mPCa between 2004 and 2014.  Intervention:   Patients were randomised to ADT with EBRT or to ADT alone.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Patients completed two validated HRQoL questionnaires (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] Quality of Life Questionnaire Core Module (QLQ-C30) and EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Prostate Module [QLQ-PR25]) at baseline and at 3, 6, 12, and24 mo after the initiation of treatment.

We previously reported the NLR as a poor prognostic marker in bladder cancer, upper-urothelial carcinoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, penile cancer, and prostate cancer. This study examined the importance of the NLR as a prognostic marker for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients who received abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide.  Methods:   A total of 805 prostate cancer patients developed in CRPC status were enrolled in this study. Of these patients, 449 received abiraterone acetate (ABI; 188 cases) or enzalutamide (ENZ; 261 cases) treatment, and the pre-treatment NLR values of these patients were obtained. We investigated the prognosis in those with higher and lower NLR values.  Results:   The median NLR was 2.90, and a receiver operating characteristics analysis suggested a candidate cut-off point of 3.02. The median overall survival (OS) was 17.3 months in the higher NLR group (≥3.02) and 27.3 months in the lower NLR group (< 3.02) (p < 0.0001). This trend was also observed in both the ABI and ENZ groups (ABI: 29.3 vs. 15.1 months; ENZ: NR vs. 19.5 months; p < 0.0001 and < 0.0001, respectively). A multivariate analysis revealed that a higher NLR was an independent risk factor. The NLR value was thus shown to be correlated with the prostate cancer progression.

Our aim was to compare the proteomic profiles of prostate tumors versus benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissues in order to identify modulated proteins as the potential biomarkers for prostate cancer. Proteins extracted from twenty prostate cancer tissue specimens and ten BPH tissues were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) coupled with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) were performed to confirm the different amounts of protein biomarkers revealed by 2DE combined with MALDI mass spectrometry. We found 42 spots whose expression in the prostate was altered more than 1.5-fold compared with BPH tissue (p<0.05). These spots represented ten different proteins that were identified by a database search after mass spectrometry: they comprised proteins involved in the regulation of actin dynamics, the cytoskeleton, and cell motility (ACTG2, ACTA2, TPM1, DES, VIM, FLNA, and TAGLN), heat shock protein-27 (Hsp27), and proteins with other functions (TR and RANBP3). Subsequent western blot and RT-PCR assays for DES, VIM, TAGLN, and Hsp27 in prostate tumor tissues and BPH tissues confirmed the observations obtained by proteomic analysis.

Methods:   A sequential explanatory mixed method approach was used. A questionnaire (n = 40) ranked experiences from 0 to 10 (worst) in the domains of invasiveness; pain; physical discomfort; and psychological discomfort. Responses were analysed with descriptive and inferential statistics. Semi-structured interviews (n = 22) obtained further insights into their perspectives and preferences and were thematically analysed.  Results:   Perceptions of invasiveness varied with 46% reporting FMs more invasive than US and 49% the same for the two procedures. The mean score for FM was 3.6 and 2.1 for US.

Tumor motion is not strictly translational and often exhibits complex six degree-of-freedom (6DoF) translational and rotational motion. Although the dosimetric impact of prostate tumor translational motion is well investigated, the dosimetric impact of 6DoF motion has only been studied with simulations or dose reconstruction. This study aims to experimentally quantify the dose error caused by 6DoF motion. The experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that 6DoF motion would cause larger dose errors than translational motion alone through gamma analyses of two-dimensional film measurements.  Methods:   Four patient-measured intrafraction prostate motion traces and four VMAT 7.25 Gy/Fx SBRT treatment plans were selected for the experiment. The traces represented typical motion patterns, including small-angle rotations (<4°), transient movement, persistent excursion, and erratic rotations (>6°). Gafchromic film was placed inside a custom-designed phantom, held by a high-precision 6DoF robotic arm for dose measurements in the coronal plane during treatment delivery. For each combination of the motion trace and treatment plan, two film measurements were made, one with 6DoF motion and the other with the three-dimensional (3D) translation components of the same trace. A gamma pass rate criteria of 2% relative dose/2 mm distance-to-agreement was used in this study and evaluated for each measurement with respect to the static reference film. Two test thresholds, 90% and 50% of the reference dose, were applied to investigate the difference in dose coverage for the PTV region and surrounding areas, respectively. The hypothesis was tested using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.  Results:   For each of the 16 plan and motion trace pairs, a reduction in the gamma pass rate was observed for 6DoF motion compared with 3D translational motion.

While mutations in some HR repair genes (e.g., BRCA1/2) have been associated with a more aggressive clinical course, prior studies correlating HR mutational status with treatment response to androgen receptor (AR) signaling inhibitors (ARSIs) or taxane-based chemotherapy have yielded conflicting results.  Methods:   We conducted a single-center retrospective analysis to assess clinical outcomes to conventional, regulatory-approved therapies in mCRPC patients with somatic (monoallelic and biallelic) and/or germline HR repair mutations compared to patients without alterations as determined by clinical-grade next-generation sequencing assays. The primary endpoint was PSA30/PSA50 response, defined as ≥30%/≥50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) reduction from baseline. Secondary endpoints of PSA progression-free survival (pPFS) and clinical/radiographic progression-free survival (crPFS) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods.  Results:   A total of 90 consecutively selected patients were included in this analysis, of which 33 (37%) were identified to have HR repair gene mutations. Age, race, Gleason score, prior surgery, and receipt of prior radiation therapy were comparable between carriers and non-carriers. There was no evidence that PSA30/PSA50 differed by HR gene mutational status. Median pPFS and crPFS ranged 3-14 months across treatment modalities, but there was no evidence either differed by HR gene mutational status (all p>0.05). There was also no difference in outcomes between those with BRCA2 or PALB2 mutations (n = 17) compared to those without HR repair mutations.  Conclusion:   HR gene mutational status was associated with comparable clinical outcomes following treatment with ARSIs or taxane-based chemotherapy. Additional prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.""","""['Alexander S Carlson', 'Rigo I Acevedo', 'Daniel M Lim', 'Roman Gulati', 'Agnes Gawne', 'Alexandra O Sokolova', 'Heather H Cheng', 'Peter S Nelson', 'R Bruce Montgomery', 'Evan Y Yu', 'Michael T Schweizer']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Distinct Response to Platinum-Based Chemotherapy among Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Harboring Alterations in Genes Involved in Homologous Recombination.', 'PROREPAIR-B: A Prospective Cohort Study of the Impact of Germline DNA Repair Mutations on the Outcomes of Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Germline DNA-repair Gene Mutations and Outcomes in Men with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Receiving First-line Abiraterone and Enzalutamide.', 'Treatment of Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Are PARP Inhibitors Shifting the Paradigm?', 'DNA Repair Deficiency Is Common in Advanced Prostate Cancer: New Therapeutic Opportunities.', 'Germline genetics of prostate cancer.', 'Clinical and genomic features of SPOP-mutant prostate cancer.', 'Efficacy of systemic therapies in men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer harboring germline ATM versus BRCA2 mutations.']"""

Around 60% of anti-cancer drugs are derived from natural resources including plants, fungi, sea creatures, and lichens. This project aims to identify the apoptotic effects and proliferative properties of extracts of Bryoria capillaris (Ach.) Brodo & D.Hawksw, Cladonia fimbriata (L.) Fr., Evernia divaricata (L.) Ach., Hypogymnia tubulosa (Schaer.) Hav., Lobaria pulmonaria (L.) Hoffm., and Usnea florida (L.) Weber ex Wigg. lichen species on prostate cancer cells. Lichen extracts were performed by ethanol, methanol, and acetone separately by using the Soxhlet apparatus and the effects of the extracts on cell viability, proliferation, and apoptosis were measured with the utilization of MTT, LDH assay, Annexin V assay, and Western Blot. Findings of our study revealed a positive correlation between the elevation of cell sensitivity and the increase in the treatment doses of the extract in that higher doses applied reverberate to higher cell sensitivity. A similar correlation was also identified between cell sensitivity elevation and the duration of the treatment. Evidence in our study have shown the existence of an anti-proliferative effect in the extracts of Bryoria capillaris, Evernia divaricata (L.) Ach., Hypogymnia tubulosa (Schaer.) Hav., Lobaria pulmonaria (L.) Hoffm., and Usnea florida (L.) Weber ex Wigg., while a similar effect was not observed in the extracts of Cladonia fimbriata. Evernia divaricata induced anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects in PC-3 cells, which induced apoptotic cell death by both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Hypogymnia tubulosa has been shown to have anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects in all extractions methods and our findings identified that both the percentage of the apoptotic cells and apoptotic protein expressions recorded an increase at lower treatment concentrations. Although Lobaria pulmonaria is known to have significant cytotoxic effects, we did not observe a decrease in cell proliferation. Indeed, proliferation marker proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) protein expression levels have shown an increase in all extracts, while Usnea florida exhibited apoptosis induction and slight proliferation reduction in extract treatments with lower concentrations. We tested 18 extracts of six lichen species during our study. Of these, Evernia divaricata and Hypogymnia tubulosa demonstrated significant apoptotic activity on prostate cancer cells including at low concentrations, which implies that it is worth pursuing the biologically active lead compounds of these extracts on prostate cancer in vitro. Further corroboratory studies are needed to validate the relative potential of these extracts as anti-metastatic and anti-tumorigenic agents.""","""['Beyza Goncu', 'Ece Sevgi', 'Cagla Kizilarslan Hancer', 'Guzin Gokay', 'Nur Ozten']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Correction: Differential anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of lichen species on human prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Lichens exerts an anti-proliferative effect on human breast and lung cancer cells through induction of apoptosis.', 'Comparison of antioxidant activity and phenolic content of three lichen species.', 'In vitro evaluation of cytotoxic, anti-proliferative, anti-oxidant, apoptotic, and anti-microbial activities of Cladonia pocillum.', 'A Review of Anti-Cancer and Related Properties of Lichen-Extracts and Metabolites.', ""The Lichens' Microbiota, Still a Mystery?"", 'DNA replication: Mechanisms and therapeutic interventions for diseases.', 'Biological Effects of Gyrophoric Acid and Other Lichen Derived Metabolites, on Cell Proliferation, Apoptosis and Cell Signaling pathways.', 'Establishment of Agrobacterium tumefaciens-Mediated Transformation of Cladonia macilenta, a Model Lichen-Forming Fungus.', 'Correction: Differential anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of lichen species on human prostate carcinoma cells.']"""

Methods:   Between 2000 and 2010, 38,735 patients with prostate cancer were diagnosed in Taiwan. After exclusions and exact matching for age, previous pneumonia, and influenza vaccination, 2188 vaccinated patients and 2188 unvaccinated patients were recruited. The incidence density of all-cause bacterial pneumonia hospitalizations was analyzed.  Results:   Over 7 years of follow-up, patients who received the PPSV23 had a significantly lower incidence density, with 142.8 per 1000 person-years versus 162.0 per 1000 person-years for unvaccinated patients. More patients in the vaccinated cohort were never hospitalized for pneumonia compared with those in the unvaccinated cohort (64.2% vs 62.2%, respectively). After adjusting for the Charlson comorbidity index, cancer treatment modalities, and socioeconomic levels, the risk of pneumonia-related hospitalization in the PPSV23 vaccination cohort was 0.48 times lower than that in the unvaccinated cohort (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 0.48; P = .046). For patients who received the influenza vaccination, subgroup analysis demonstrated that PPSV23 vaccination significantly decreased the risk (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 0.45; P < .001). Compared with unvaccinated controls, PPSV23-vaccinated patients had a lower cumulative incidence for the first occurrence of pneumonia-related hospitalization (34.49% vs 36.36%; P = .178) and higher overall survival (47.5% and 42.3%, respectively; P < .001).

Significant PSA changes occur after enucleation, which interfere with later screening for PCa. It remains unclear which patients need further diagnostic investigations for PCa after EEP. The goal of this study was to identify an independent predictor for PCa diagnosis after Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate (HoLEP) in patients whose HoLEP resection specimen did not show PCa.  Methods:   Data of 773 patients who underwent HoLEP for BPO between 2010 and 2018 in a referral center were analyzed. Exclusion criteria were PCa detection in the HoLEP specimen or absence of post-operative PSA values. Patients were divided in a PCa group and Control group depending on whether or not PCa was detected during follow-up after HoLEP. The predictive value for future diagnosis of PCa of different forms of PSA-change after HoLEP was analyzed by multivariate Cox regression and ROC analysis.  Results:   Overall, 24 (4.2%) patients developed PCa after HoLEP. At 5 year follow-up, the PCa-free survival rate was 85%. First post-operative PSA was an independent predictor of PCa diagnosis after HoLEP (HR 1.106, 95% CI 1.074-1.139, p < 0.001, ROC AUC 0.903) with an optimal cut-off value of 1.73 ng/ml (sensitivity 83.3%, specificity 82.3%).  Conclusions:   For patients who underwent HoLEP for BPO, post-operative PSA after HoLEP is an independent predictor for future PCa diagnosis.

The magnitude of the difference for prostatectomy was greater for men aged 70 years or more; for radiation therapy alone, it was larger for those diagnosed before age 70. The differences between private and public services narrowed during 2011-2017 for men with ISUP grade 1 disease, but not ISUP grade 2-5 tumours.

In the lesion-based analysis, compared to the RP only patients, those who had received postoperative RT, had less lymph node (LN) recurrences distal to the common iliac bifurcation (35.2 vs. 57.9%, p = 0.05), but were more likely to harbor positive LNs proximal to the iliac bifurcation and in the presacral (34.2 vs. 12.3%, p = 0.002) areas as well as bone metastases (25.7 vs. 8.8%, p = 0.01). In the patient-based analysis, the patients with postoperative RT after RP had less recurrence in the pelvis only (pelvic LNs and/or prostate bed) (52.4 vs. 79%, p = 0.002), but were more likely to harbor extrapelvic recurrence (41.9 vs. 15.8%, p = 0.001). Patients who received RT to the prostate bed only had more recurrence to the pelvic LN only (54.2% vs. 23.4%, p = 0.002), but less extrapelvic recurrence (31.3 vs. 53.2%, p = 0.03) and less bone recurrence (16.7 vs. 36.2%, p = 0.031) compared to those patients, who received RT to the prostate bed and pelvic nodes.

Diagnostic performance was assessed retrospectively by using MRI/transrectal ultrasound fusion biopsy and 10-core systematic biopsy as the reference. From a total of 359 lesions, GS ≥ 7 tumor was present in 135 lesions (37.60%). Area under the ROC curve (AUC) revealed slightly lower values for peripheral zone (PZ) and transition zone (TZ) scoring in v2.1, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. A significant number of score 2 lesions in the TZ were downgraded to score 1 in v2.1 showing 0% GS ≥ 7 tumor (0/11). The newly introduced diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) upgrading rule in v2.1 was applied in 6 lesions from a total of 143 TZ lesions (4.2%).

We assessed the association between the use of commonly prescribed concomitant medications and biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS) in patients with localised PCa treated with radiotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).  Materials and methods:   A secondary pooled analysis of two phase III randomised trials was carried out. In the first trial, patients with localised PCa with clinical stage T1b-T3, prostate-specific antigen <30 ng/ml and Gleason score ≤7 were treated with radical radiotherapy and 6 months of ADT starting 4 months before or concomitantly with radiotherapy. In the second trial, patients with high-risk PCa were treated with radical radiotherapy and 36 months of ADT with randomisation to three-dimensional conformal or intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Information on concomitant medications was collected from the medical record. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression was used to identify factors associated with bRFS.  Results:   Overall, 486 patients were evaluable. The median follow-up was 125 months; 10-year bRFS was 83.7%. On univariable analysis, receipt of metformin was significantly associated with worse bRFS. Ten-year bRFS was 73% and 85% for patients with and without concomitant metformin (adjusted hazard ratio 2.11, 95% confidence interval 1.03-4.33). Similar evidence of an association was observed with sulfonamide-based α1-receptor blockers (adjusted hazard ratio 2.72, 95% confidence interval 1.31-5.66). However, no such association was seen with receipt of quinazoline-based α1-receptor blockers (adjusted hazard ratio 1.09, 95% confidence interval 0.42-2.82). There was no significant association between bRFS and receipt of all other medication classes considered.  Conclusions:   In this population of patients with localised PCa treated with radiotherapy and ADT, receipt of concomitant metformin and sulfonamide-based α1-receptor blockers was associated with inferior biochemical outcome.

The present study reports chemically modified polymeric nanocapsules (NCs) encapsulating combination of chemotherapeutic drugs Docetaxel (DTX) and Quercetin (QU) for its active targeting to prostate cancer (PCa). The active targeting was achieved by conjugating Luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) ligand to poly-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) using polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a spacer. The structure of the conjugates was characterized and confirmed using 1H NMR and ATR-FTIR. The drug encapsulated NCs showed a homogenous size distribution with their size ranging between 120 and 150 nm, and exhibited a negative zeta potential in the range of -20 to -40 mV. The in vitro release studies highlighted the sustained drug release pattern from the respective NCs; while the PEG coating to polymeric NCs provided serum stability to the NCs. The in vitro biological evaluation of the NCs was conducted using PC-3 and LNCaP cell lines. The results of the cellular uptake studies showed a significantly higher untake of the LHRH targeted NCs, while the LHRH-targeted-PEGylated DTX: QU NCs exhibited higher caspase-3 activity. The cell viability assay results showed the enhanced cell inhibition activity of the combinatorial DTX: QU when compared to individual DTX. Further, higher cell cytotoxicity was achieved by LHRH-targeted DTX: QU NCs as compared to their free-form or non-targeted NCs. Finally, the results of in vivo tumor localization and in vivo antitumor activity studies complimented and upheld the in vitro results, demonstrating the beneficial role of PLGA-PEG-LHRH NCs encapsulating combination of DTX and QU in combating prostate cancer (PCa).""","""['Ajinkya A Shitole', 'Neeti Sharma', 'Prabhanjan Giram', 'Anand Khandwekar', 'Meghna Baruah', 'Baijayantimala Garnaik', 'Santosh Koratkar']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Mater Sci Eng C Mater Biol Appl""","""['Highly Stable PEGylated Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) Nanoparticles for the Effective Delivery of Docetaxel in Prostate Cancers.', 'Enzymatic synthesis of PEGylated lactide-diester-diol copolyesters for highly efficient targeted anticancer drug delivery.', 'Polyethylene glycol conjugated polymeric nanocapsules for targeted delivery of quercetin to folate-expressing cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'Core-Shell Type Lipidic and Polymeric Nanocapsules: the Transformative Multifaceted Delivery Systems.', 'Developments in the use of nanocapsules in oncology.', 'Recent Progress in Nanotechnology Improving the Therapeutic Potential of Polyphenols for Cancer.', 'Advanced Delivery System of Polyphenols for Effective Cancer Prevention and Therapy.', 'Recent Trends in Nanomedicine-Based Strategies to Overcome Multidrug Resistance in Tumors.', 'An Up-to-Date Review of Natural Nanoparticles for Cancer Management.', 'Quercetin and Its Nano-Scale Delivery Systems in Prostate Cancer Therapy: Paving the Way for Cancer Elimination and Reversing Chemoresistance.']"""

Breast cancer screening (BCS) services are an effective strategy for early determining of breast cancer. Hence, it is imperative to understand the utilisation of BCS services and their correlated predictors in LRCs. This study aims to determine the distribution of predictors that significantly influence the utilisation of BCS services among women in LRCs.  Methods:   The present study used data on 140,974 women aged 40 years or over from 14 LRCs. The data came from country Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) between 2008 and 2016. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed to investigate the significant predictors that influence the use of BCS services.  Results:   The utilisation of BCS services was 15.41%, varying from 81.10% (95% CI: 76.85-84.73%) in one European country, to 18.61% (95% CI: 18.16 to 19.06%) in Asian countries, 14.30% (95% CI: 13.67-14.96%) in American countries, and 14.29% (95% CI: 13.87-14.74%). Factors that were significantly associated to increase the use of BCS services include a higher level of education (OR = 2.48), advanced age at first birth (> 25 years) (OR = 1.65), female-headed households (OR = 1.65), access to mass media communication (OR = 1.84), health insurance coverage (OR = 1.09), urban residence (OR = 1.20) and highest socio-economic status (OR = 2.01). However, obese women shown a significantly 11% (OR = 0.89) lower use of BSC services compared to health weight women.  Conclusion:   The utilisation of BCS services is low in many LRCs. The findings of this study will assist policymakers in identifying the factors that influence the use of BCS services. To increase the national BCS rate, more attention should be essential to under-represented clusters; in particular women who have a poor socioeconomic clusters, live in a rural community, have limited access to mass media communication, and are have a low level educational background. These factors highlight the necessity for a new country-specific emphasis of promotional campaigns, health education, and policy targeting these underrepresented groups in LRCs.""","""['Rashidul Alam Mahumud', 'Jeff Gow', 'Syed Afroz Keramat', 'Sonja March', 'Jeff Dunn', 'Khorshed Alam', 'Andre M N Renzaho']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""BMC Public Health""","""['Association of contextual factors and breast cancer screening: finding new targets to promote early detection.', 'Wealth stratified inequalities in service utilisation of breast cancer screening across the geographical regions: a pooled decomposition analysis.', ""Services for women's sexual and reproductive health in India: an analysis of treatment-seeking for symptoms of reproductive tract infections in a nationally representative survey."", 'Opportunity for breast cancer screening in limited resource countries: a literature review and implications for Iran.', 'Empowering older women: strategies to enhance their health and health care.', 'A consensus approach: Understanding the support needs of women in Newport West, Wales, to participate in breast screening.', 'Factors associated with the uptake of clinical breast examination among women of reproductive age in Lesotho: analysis of a national survey.', 'Mapping evidence on knowledge of breast cancer screening and its uptake among women in Ghana: a scoping review.']"""

A sandwich-type genoassay is conducted on magnetic beads to collect the target from the sample by specific hybridization, making the assay appropriate for PCA3 detection in biological fluids. The success of the method hinges on the use of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) to link the amount of nucleic acid biomarker to the generation of glucose. In particular, specifically attached ALP molecules hydrolyze D-glucose-1-phosphate into D-glucose, thus enabling the amplification of the recorded signal on the personal glucose meter. The developed genoassay exhibits good sensitivity (3.3 ± 0.2 mg glucose dL-1 pM-1) for PCA3, with a dynamic range of 5 to 100 pM and a quantification limit of 5 pM.

Among external factors, antibiotics are considered to be the most important agent capable of producing dysbiosis in the gut flora, either temporally or permanently. The human microbiome has several beneficial effects in terms of maintaining appropriate human health, but its alteration has been implicated in the development of many illnesses. Our basic aim was to explore a possible relationship between the consumption of different antibiotic classes and the incidence of the most common cancer types (male, female) in European countries. A database of the average, yearly antibiotic consumption (1997-2018) has been developed and the consumption figures were compared to the eight, most frequent cancer incidence calculated for 2018 in 30 European countries. Pearson correlation has indicated different degrees of positive (supportive) and negative (inhibitor) significant associations between antibiotic consumption figures and cancer prevalence. It has been observed that certain antibiotic classes with positive correlation probably augment the incidence of certain cancer types, while others, with negative correlation, may show some inhibitory effect. The relatively higher or lower consumption pattern of different classes of antibiotics could be related to certain cancer prevalence figures in different European countries. Our results indicated that countries with relatively high consumption of narrow-spectrum penicillin (J01CE, J01CF) and tetracycline (J01A), like certain Scandinavian countries, showed a higher incidence of female colorectal cancer, female lung cancer, melanoma, breast, prostate and uterus corpus cancer. Countries with relatively higher consumption of broad-spectrum penicillin (J01CA, J01CR) and some broad-spectrum antibiotics (J01D, J01F, J01M), like Greece, Hungary, Slovakia, France, etc. showed a higher incidence rate of male lung cancer and male bladder cancer. The higher incidence rate of different cancer types showed association with the higher consumption of antibiotics with ""augmenting"" properties and with less consumption of antibiotics with ""inhibitory"" properties.""","""['Gábor Ternák', 'Károly Berényi', 'András Sümegi', 'Ágnes Szenczi', 'Barbara Fodor', 'Balázs Németh', 'István Kiss']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Antibiotics (Basel)""","""['Antibiotic Consumption Patterns in European Countries Might Be Associated with the Prevalence of Type 1 and 2 Diabetes.', 'Association of antibiotic-consumption patterns with the prevalence of hematological malignancies in European countries.', ""Antibiotic Consumption Patterns in European Countries Are Associated with the Prevalence of Parkinson's Disease; the Possible Augmenting Role of the Narrow-Spectrum Penicillin."", 'Peritonsillar abscess: clinical aspects of microbiology, risk factors, and the association with parapharyngeal abscess.', 'Cancer and Mediterranean dietary traditions.', 'The Link Between the Microbiota and HER2+ Breast Cancer: The New Challenge of Precision Medicine.', 'Antibiotic Consumption Patterns in European Countries Might Be Associated with the Prevalence of Type 1 and 2 Diabetes.', 'Association of antibiotic-consumption patterns with the prevalence of hematological malignancies in European countries.', 'Sintilimab treatment for ureteral carcinoma following bladder cancer leads to leukopenia: a case report.', 'Intratumoral Microbiota Impacts the First-Line Treatment Efficacy and Survival in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients Free of Lung Infection.']"""

Improving information from current sequences, such as T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging, and additional sequences, such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST), may enhance the performance of multi-parametric MRI. The majority of these techniques are sensitive to B0-field variations and may result in image distortions including signal pile-up and stretching (echo planar imaging (EPI) based DW-MRI) or unwanted shifts in the frequency spectrum (CEST and MRS). Our aim is to temporally and spatially characterize B0-field changes in the prostate. Ten male patients are imaged using dual-echo gradient echo sequences with varying repetitions on a 3 T scanner to evaluate the temporal B0-field changes within the prostate. A phantom is also imaged to consider no physiological motion. The spatial B0-field variations in the prostate are reported as B0-field values (Hz), their spatial gradients (Hz/mm) and the resultant distortions in EPI based DW-MRI images (b-value = 0 s/mm2 and two oppositely phase encoded directions). Over a period of minutes, temporal changes in B0-field values were ≤19 Hz for minimal bowel motion and ≥30 Hz for large motion. Spatially across the prostate, the B0-field values had an interquartile range of ≤18 Hz (minimal motion) and ≤44 Hz (large motion). The B0-field gradients were between -2 and 5 Hz/mm (minimal motion) and 2 and 12 Hz/mm (large motion).

Objective.—:   To evaluate the capability of this new method for primary diagnostic interpretation in clinical prostate biopsy specimens.  Design.—:   Forty patients with a high likelihood of prostate cancer based on magnetic resonance imaging consented to investigational core biopsy. A subset of samples was used for direct comparison of physical slide preparation effects and time-tracking determination with multiphoton microscopy. Twenty samples were processed for diagnostic comparison between multilevel digital slides and subsequently produced physical slides. A reference diagnosis based on all data was established using grade groups. Level of diagnostic match and requests for immunohistochemistry were compared between physical and digital diagnoses.

Results.—:   Interpretations based on direct multiphoton imaging yielded diagnoses that were at least as accurate as standard histology; cancer diagnosis correlation was 89% (51 of 57) by physical slides and 95% (53 of 56) by multiphoton microscopy. Grade-level concordance was 73% (44 of 60) by either method. Immunohistochemistry for routine prostate cancer-associated markers on these alternatively processed tissues was unaffected. Alternatively processed tissues resulted in longer measured core and cancer lengths, suggestive of improved orientation and visualization.

Many possible factors including the utility of prostate specific antigen tests, lifestyle remodeling, and patient's comorbidities may contribute to the increasing of incidence or prostate cancer. We aim to use the nationwide Health and Welfare Database (HWD) to investigate possible associated factors.We used HWD, a nationwide database of medical information, to assess the incidence of prostate cancer, utilization of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, and underlying diseases of patients and to evaluate whether there was a common trend among these factors.In total, 32,508 patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer from 2006 to 2013 were identified. The incidence rate of prostate cancer per 100,000 men increased from 35.47 in 2006 to 52.87 in 2012. The number of patients with prostate cancer and underlying diseases related to metabolic syndrome increased every year. The number of total PSA tests and patients undergoing PSA testing, as well as average times of PSA testing per person in the whole population, increased every year. The average PSA test times of patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer within 3 years before the diagnosis of prostate cancer also increased every year. There was a high correlation between the average PSA test times and the number of patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer (r = 0.9734).The trends of incidence of prostate cancer, utilization of PSA testing, and underlying diseases related to metabolic syndrome at the diagnoses of cancer were similar, increasing every year in the study period. The results suggested that increasing use of PSA tests may increase the diagnosis of prostate cancers. Underlying diseases related to metabolic syndrome might also affect the incidence of prostate cancer.""","""['Po-Hung Lin', 'Su-Wei Chang', 'Ling-Hsuan Tsai', 'Hung-Cheng Kan', 'Jui-Ming Liu', 'Cheng-Keng Chuang', 'See-Tong Pang', 'Kai-Jie Yu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Prostate-specific antigen testing for prostate cancer: Depleting a limited pool of susceptible individuals?', 'Actual lowering effect of metabolic syndrome on serum prostate-specific antigen levels is partly concealed by enlarged prostate: results from a large-scale population-based study.', 'Discrepancies between guidelines and clinical practice regarding prostate-specific antigen testing.', 'Population screening for prostate cancer and emerging concepts for young men.', 'Screening for prostate cancer with the prostate-specific antigen test: a review of current evidence.', 'Learning Curve of Transperineal MRI/US Fusion Prostate Biopsy: 4-Year Experience.', 'Comparative Outcomes of Robotic Radical Prostatectomy in Patients with Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Salvage Radiotherapy Plus Androgen Deprivation Therapy for High-Risk Prostate Cancer with Biochemical Failure after High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound as Primary Treatment.', 'Pan-Asian adapted ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with prostate cancer.', 'Acute, Subchronic, and Chronic Complications of Radical Prostatectomy Versus Radiotherapy With Hormone Therapy in Older Adults With High-Risk Prostate Adenocarcinoma.']"""

We have noted heterogeneity within the single-cell subtype of Gleason pattern 5 prostatic adenocarcinoma that has not been fully addressed. Therefore, we retrospectively reviewed a series of radical prostatectomies with high-grade prostatic adenocarcinoma (Grade Group 4 or 5), identifying tumors with a component of single-cell infiltration. Additional cases identified prospectively were also included. TNM status, association with other histologic patterns, and clinical follow-up status were determined. Immunohistochemistry for NKX3.1, E-cadherin, p120 catenin, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were performed in each case. Eighteen cases with a component of well-developed Gleason pattern 5 characterized by single infiltrative cells that comprised ≥5% of the tumor were identified (15/202 retrospective radical prostatectomies with the high-grade disease [7.5%]). The single-cell pattern ranged from 5% to 50% of the tumor volume, with 5 cases containing ≥40%, and variable secondary architecture included diffuse infiltrating single cells with targetoid growth pattern around benign glands, solid expansive nests of noncohesive cells, and corded/single file growth pattern. Further morphologic analysis demonstrated 2 distinct histologic subtypes: (1) (subtype 1; n=9) monomorphic ""plasmacytoid"" tumor cells with eccentrically placed nuclei and variable intracytoplasmic vacuoles with bland cytology and discohesion and (2) (subtype 2; n=9) more cohesive tumor cells with greater cytologic atypia characterized by prominent nucleoli, greater variability in nuclear size/shape, occasional mitotic figures, and more irregular infiltration. By immunohistochemistry, NKX3.1 nuclear expression and PSA cytoplasmic expression was retained in all cases. Concomitant membranous E-cadherin loss and strong cytoplasmic p120 catenin expression were present in 5 of the 18 (28%) cases, all in subtype 1 (5/9, 56%). Overall, 56% (10/18) of patients had advanced-stage disease (≥pT3b), and 70% (7/10) of these patients had associated lymphovascular invasion. All patients had concomitant cribriform patterns of carcinoma. The outcome was available for 14 patients: 4 died of unknown cause; 6 had biochemical recurrence with distant bone metastasis in 5 of the 6; and 4 patients with <3 years of follow-up currently have undetectable serum PSA levels (2 patients received salvage radiotherapy with androgen deprivation and 2 remain on routine follow-up). In summary, the single-cell pattern of Gleason pattern 5 prostatic adenocarcinoma is uniformly associated with other high-risk histologic patterns (eg, cribriform growth), and high-stage disease with distant metastasis is not uncommon. Our data suggest that the ""single-cell"" Gleason pattern 5 prostatic adenocarcinoma contains 2 distinct subtypes. Somatic CDH1 alterations may play a role in the development of the ""plasmacytoid"" pattern characterized by monomorphic cytology with concomitant E-cadherin loss and aberrant p120 catenin expression.""","""['Jane K Nguyen', 'Yunn-Yi Chen', 'Cristina Magi-Galluzzi', 'Jesse K McKenney']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['High-grade foamy gland prostatic adenocarcinoma on biopsy or transurethral resection: a morphologic study of 55 cases.', 'Prostatic Adenocarcinoma With Focal Pleomorphic Giant Cell Features: A Series of 30 Cases.', 'Prevalence of adverse pathology features in grade group 2 prostatectomy specimens with syn- or metachronous metastatic disease.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.', 'Gleason grading and prognostic factors in carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Patient with prostatic adenocarcinoma with plasmacytoid features and an aberrant immunohistochemical phenotype diagnosed by biopsy and a mini-review of plasmacytoid features in the genitourinary system: A case report.']"""

It also increases the risk of delayed treatment of aggressive PCa. DNA methylation aberrations are important events for gene expression dysregulation during tumorigenesis and have been suggested as novel candidate biomarkers for PCa. This may improve the diagnosis and prognosis of PCa. This study assessed the differential methylation and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression between normal and PCa samples. Correlation between promoter methylation and mRNA expression was estimated using Pearson's correlation coefficients. Moreover, the diagnostic potential of candidate methylation markers was estimated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve using continuous beta values. Survival and Cox analysis was performed to evaluate the prognostic potential of the candidate methylation markers. A total of 359 hypermethylated sites 3435 hypomethylation sites, 483 upregulated genes, and 1341 downregulated genes were identified from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Furthermore, 17 hypermethylated sites (covering 13 genes), including known genes associated with hypermethylation in PCa (e.g., AOX1 and C1orf114), showed high discrimination between adjacent normal tissues and PCa samples with the area under the ROC curve from 0.88 to 0.94. Notably, ANXA2, FGFR2, HAAO, and KCNE3 were identified as valuable prognostic markers of PCa through the Kaplan-Meier analysis. Using gene methylation as a continuous variable, four promoter hypermethylation was significantly associated with disease-free survival in univariate Cox regression and multivariate Cox regression.

In this study, we intended to investigate the expression, functions and the corresponding mechanisms of PCAT6 in glioblastoma. We observed that PCAT6 expression was upregulated in glioblastoma tissues and cell lines and its high expression was due to the transcriptional activation by Yin Yang 1. miR-513 was a target of PCAT6 and Insulin like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) was a target of miR-513. Hence, PCAT6 upregulated IGF2BP1 expression via miR-513 in a competing endogenous RNAs manner. PCAT6 and IGF2BP1 functioned as oncogenes while miR-513 acted as a tumor suppressor gene in glioblastoma. PCAT6 and miR-513 modulated the proliferation and survival of glioblastoma cells via AKT signaling by mediating IGF2BP1. IGF2BP1 raised the expression of PCAT6 by increasing its stability.

Fiducial markers appear as small signal voids in MRI images and are often difficult to discern. Existing clinical methods for fiducial marker localization require multiple MRI sequences and/or manual interaction and specialized expertise. In this study, we develop a robust method for automatic fiducial marker detection in prostate MRI simulation images and quantify the pretreatment alignment accuracy using automatically detected fiducial markers in MRI.  Methods and materials:   In this study, a deep learning-based algorithm was used to convert MRI images into labeled fiducial marker volumes. Seventy-seven prostate cancer patients who received marker implantation prior to MRI and CT simulation imaging were selected for this study. Multiple-Echo T1 -VIBE MRI images were acquired, and images were stratified (at the patient level) based on the presence of intraprostatic calcifications. Ground truth (GT) contours were defined by an expert on MRI using CT images. Training was done using the pix2pix generative adversarial network (GAN) image-to-image translation package and model testing was done using fivefold cross validation. For performance comparison, an experienced medical dosimetrist and a medical physicist each manually contoured fiducial markers in MRI images. The percent of correct detections and F1 classification scores are reported for markers detected using the automatic detection algorithm and human observers. The patient positioning errors were quantified by calculating the target registration errors (TREs) from fiducial marker driven rigid registration between MRI and CBCT images. Target registration errors were quantified for fiducial marker contours defined on MRI by the automatic detection algorithm and the two expert human observers.  Results:   Ninety-six percent of implanted fiducial markers were correctly identified using the automatic detection algorithm. Two expert raters correctly identified 97% and 96% of fiducial markers, respectively. The F1 classification score was 0.68, 0.75, and 0.72 for the automatic detection algorithm and two human raters, respectively. The main source of false discoveries was intraprostatic calcifications. The mean TRE differences between alignments from automatic detection algorithm and human detected markers and GT were <1 mm.  Conclusions:   We have developed a deep learning-based approach to automatically detect fiducial markers in MRI-only simulation images in a clinically representative patient cohort. The automatic detection algorithm-predicted markers can allow for patient setup with similar accuracy to independent human observers.""","""['Kamal Singhrao', 'Jie Fu', 'Neil R Parikh', 'Argin G Mikaeilian', 'Dan Ruan', 'Amar U Kishan', 'John H Lewis']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['MRI-alone radiation therapy planning for prostate cancer: Automatic fiducial marker detection.', 'Registration free automatic identification of gold fiducial markers in MRI target delineation images for prostate radiotherapy.', 'Quantification of fiducial marker visibility for MRI-only prostate radiotherapy simulation.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Deep learning based unpaired image-to-image translation applications for medical physics: a systematic review.', 'Deep Learning in MRI-guided Radiation Therapy: A Systematic Review.']"""

Methods:   The msDP-GRE sequence is combined with a 3D Cartesian, centric k-space trajectory with center oversampling. Oversampled k-space center averaging and phase cycling are used to address motion- and eddy current-induced magnitude corruption. Extended-phase-graph (EPG) simulations and ADC dictionary matching are used to compensate for T1 effects. To shorten the acquisition time, each volume is undersampled by a factor of two and reconstructed using iterative sensitivity encoding. The proposed approach is characterized using simulations and validated in a kiwifruit phantom, comparing the msDP-GRE ADC maps obtained using both standard monoexponential fitting and dictionary matching with the clinical standard single-shot diffusion weighted-echo planar imaging (ssDW-EPI) ADC. Initial in vivo feasibility is tested in three healthy subjects, and geometric distortion is compared with anatomical T2 -weighted-turbo spin echo.  Results:   In the kiwifruit phantom experiment, the signal magnitude could be recovered using k-space center averaging and phase cycling. No statistically significant difference was observed in the ADC values estimated using msDP-GRE with dictionary matching and clinical standard DW-EPI (P < .05). The in vivo prostate msDP-GRE scans were free of geometric distortion caused by off-resonance susceptibility, and the ADC values in the prostate were in agreement with values found in the published literature.

However, the extent to which treatment selection bias (TSB) affects overall survival (OS) in cancer CER remains poorly defined. We sought to quantify the TSB effect on OS in the setting of low-risk prostate cancer, where 10-year prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS) approaches 100% regardless of treatment modality.  Methods:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried for patients with low-risk prostate cancer (cT1-T2a, PSA < 10, and Gleason 6) who received radical prostatectomy (RP), brachytherapy (BT), or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) from 2005 to 2015. The TSB effect was defined as the unadjusted 10-year OS difference between modalities that was not due to differences in PCSS. Propensity score matching was used to estimate the TSB effect on OS due to measured confounders (variables present in the database and associated with OS) and unmeasured confounders.  Results:   A total of 50,804 patients were included (8845 RP; 18,252 BT; 23,707 EBRT) with a median follow-up of 7.4 years. The 10-year PCSS for the entire cohort was 99%. The 10-year OS was 92.9% for RP, 83.6% for BT, and 76.9% for EBRT (p < 0.001). OS differences persisted after propensity score matching of RP vs. EBRT (7.4%), RP vs. BT (4.6%), and BT vs. EBRT (3.7%) (all p < 0.001). The TSB effect on 10-year OS was estimated to be 15.0% for RP vs. EBRT (8.6% measured, 6.4% unmeasured), 8.5% for RP vs. BT (4.8% measured, 3.7% unmeasured), and 6.5% for BT vs. EBRT (3.1% measured, 3.4% unmeasured).  Conclusions:   Patients with low-risk prostate cancer selected for RP exhibited large OS differences despite similar PCSS compared to radiotherapy, suggesting OS differences are almost entirely driven by TSB.

Methods:   Patients with CP/CPPS diagnosis were randomized in this prospective, sham-controlled, double-blind study either to the active groups (Group B, C) who received 5000 shockwaves per session with energy flux density 0.1 mJ/mm2 or to the sham group (Group A) who received 5000 shockwaves from a visually identical sham probe. All groups underwent six sessions (once/week). LiST effects on pain, micturition, quality of life (QoL), and erectile function were evaluated at 4, 12, and 24 weeks after treatment. The parameters were investigated using validated questionnaires. Uroflowmetry and post void residual calculation were performed at baseline and at 4- and 12-week FU visit.

After a median time follow-up of 36 months, the rates of csPCa ISUP GG ≥ 2 (6.1 vs. 4.4%; p = 0.6) and csPCa ISUP GG ≥ 3 (3.3 vs. 1.1%; p = 0.2) were similar in SB GROUP vs. TB GROUP. Moreover, in TB GROUP patients that avoided prostate biopsies because of negative baseline mpMRI (n = 145), only 4.1% exhibited csPCa ISUP GG ≥ 2 during follow-up. Moreover, none of these patients (PI-RADS ≤ 2) had csPCa ISUP GG ≥ 3.  Conclusions:   In biopsy naïve setting, a diagnostic pathway including pre-biopsy mpMRI and TB of only PCa suspicious lesions is not associated with higher rates of csPCa during follow-up, relative to a diagnostic pathway of SB. Moreover, patients with negative baseline mpMRI could safely avoid prostate biopsies and could be followed with repeated PSA testing, since only a small proportion of them would harbor csPCa.""","""['Stefano Luzzago', 'Ottavio de Cobelli', 'Francesco A Mistretta', 'Mattia Luca Piccinelli', 'Vito Lorusso', 'Michele Morelli', 'Roberto Bianchi', 'Michele Catellani', 'Gabriele Cozzi', 'Ettore Di Trapani', 'Paola Pricolo', 'Sarah Alessi', 'Matteo Ferro', 'Giulia Marvaso', 'Deliu-Victor Matei', 'Barbara Alicja Jereczek-Fossa', 'Giuseppe Petralia', 'Gennaro Musi']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Pathological findings at radical prostatectomy of biopsy naïve men diagnosed with MRI targeted biopsy alone without concomitant standard systematic sampling.', 'Is There Still a Need for Repeated Systematic Biopsies in Patients with Previous Negative Biopsies in the Era of Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Biopsies of the Prostate?', 'A novel nomogram to identify candidates for active surveillance amongst patients with International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Grade Group (GG) 1 or ISUP GG2 prostate cancer, according to multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging findings.', 'Positive Predictive Value of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2 for the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Comparing Three Different Techniques for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Prostate Biopsies: A Systematic Review of In-bore versus Magnetic Resonance Imaging-transrectal Ultrasound fusion versus Cognitive Registration.

Is it simply a marker of resistance to 2nd-generation androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSi) like abiraterone acetate (Abi) and enzalutamide (Enza) or a functional driver of lethal resistance via its ligand-independent transcriptional activity? To resolve this question, the correlation between resistance to ARSi and genetic chances and expression of full length AR (AR-FL) vs. AR-V7 were evaluated in a series of independent patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). While all PDXs lack PTEN expression, there is no consistent requirement for mutation in TP53, RB1, BRCA2, PIK3CA, or MSH2, or expression of SOX2 or ERG and ARSi resistance. Elevated expression of AR-FL alone is sufficient for Abi but not Enza resistance, even if AR-FL is gain-of-function (GOF) mutated. Enza resistance is consistently correlated with enhanced AR-V7 expression. In vitro and in vivo growth responses of Abi-/Enza-resistant LNCaP-95 cells in which CRISPR-Cas9 was used to knockout AR-FL or AR-V7 alone or in combination were evaluated. Combining these growth responses with RNAseq analysis demonstrates that both AR-FL- and AR-V7-dependent transcriptional complementation are needed for Abi/Enza resistance.""","""['Yezi Zhu', 'Susan L Dalrymple', 'Ilsa Coleman', 'S Lilly Zheng', 'Jianfeng Xu', 'Jody E Hooper', 'Emmanuel S Antonarakis', 'Angelo M De Marzo', 'Alan K Meeker', 'Peter S Nelson', 'William B Isaacs', 'Samuel R Denmeade', 'Jun Luo', 'W Nathaniel Brennen', 'John T Isaacs']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Correction to: Role of androgen receptor splice variant-7 (AR-V7) in prostate cancer resistance to 2nd-generation androgen receptor signaling inhibitors.', 'Correction: Role of androgen receptor splice variant-7 (AR-V7) in prostate cancer resistance to 2nd-generation androgen receptor signaling inhibitors.', 'Preclinical Study using Malat1 Small Interfering RNA or Androgen Receptor Splicing Variant 7 Degradation Enhancer ASC-J9® to Suppress Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Niclosamide enhances abiraterone treatment via inhibition of androgen receptor variants in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor splice variants activating the full-length receptor in mediating resistance to androgen-directed therapy.', 'AR-V7 and prostate cancer: The watershed for treatment selection?', 'Androgen Receptor Splice Variant, AR-V7, as a Biomarker of Resistance to Androgen Axis-Targeted Therapies in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'LOX-1 Activation by oxLDL Induces AR and AR-V7 Expression via NF-κB and STAT3 Signaling Pathways Reducing Enzalutamide Cytotoxic Effects.', 'The Role of ERα and ERβ in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer and Current Therapeutic Approaches.', 'A compendium of Androgen Receptor Variant 7 target genes and their role in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Preclinical models of prostate cancer - modelling androgen dependency and castration resistance in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo.', 'AR and PI3K/AKT in Prostate Cancer: A Tale of Two Interconnected Pathways.']"""

We found that testosterone supplementation significantly impaired docetaxel tumour accumulation in a CRPC model, resulting in decreased tubulin stabilisation and antitumour activity. Furthermore, testosterone competed with docetaxel for uptake by the drug transporter OATP1B3. Irrespective of docetaxel-induced tubulin stabilisation, AR signalling by testosterone counteracted docetaxel efficacy. AR-pathway activation could also reverse long-term tumour regression by docetaxel treatment in vivo.

Experimental design:   Patients with mCRPC consented to the molecular analyses of diagnostic and mCRPC biopsies. Genomic analyses involved targeted next-generation (MiSeq; Illumina) and exome sequencing (NovaSeq; Illumina). TILs were assessed by validated immunocytochemistry coupled with deep learning-based artificial intelligence analyses including multiplex immunofluorescence assays for CD4, CD8, and FOXP3 evaluating TIL subsets.

Results:   Biopsies from 913 patients underwent targeted sequencing between February 2015 and October 2019. Forty-three patients (4.7%) had tumors with CDK12 alterations. CDK12-altered cancers had distinctive features, with some revealing high chromosomal break numbers in exome sequencing.

Regular assessment of contouring IOV is not commonly performed in clinical practice due to the large time commitment required of clinicians from conventional methods. This work uses retrospective information from past treatment plans to facilitate a time-efficient, evidence-based intervention to reduce contouring IOV.  Methods:   The contours of 492 prostate cancer treatment plans created by four radiation oncologists were analyzed in this study. Structure volumes, lengths, and DVHs were extracted from the treatment planning system and stratified based on primary oncologist and inclusion of a pelvic lymph node (PLN) target. Inter-observer variations and their dosimetric consequences were assessed using Student's t-tests. Results of this analysis were presented at an intervention meeting, where new consensus contour definitions were agreed upon. The impact of the intervention was assessed one-year later by repeating the analysis on 152 new plans.  Results:   Significant IOV in prostate and PLN target delineation existed pre-intervention between oncologists, impacting dose to nearby OARs. IOV was also present for rectum and penile-bulb structures. Post-intervention, IOV decreased for all previously discordant structures. Dosimetric variations were also reduced. Although target contouring concordance increased significantly, some variations still persisted for PLN structures, highlighting remaining areas for improvement.  Conclusion:   We detected significant contouring IOV in routine practice using easily accessible retrospective data and successfully decreased IOV in our clinic through a reflective intervention. Continued application of this approach may aid improvements in practice standardization and enhance quality of care.""","""['H M Patrick', 'L Souhami', 'J Kildea']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Multi-observer contouring of male pelvic anatomy: Highly variable agreement across conventional and emerging structures of interest.', 'Technology assessment of automated atlas based segmentation in prostate bed contouring.', 'A review of interventions to reduce inter-observer variability in volume delineation in radiation oncology.', 'Inter-observer variability in contouring the penile bulb on CT images for prostate cancer treatment planning.', 'Delineation of target volumes and organs at risk in adjuvant radiotherapy of early breast cancer: national guidelines and contouring atlas by the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group.', 'Clinical Validation and Treatment Plan Evaluation Based on Autodelineation of the Clinical Target Volume for Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy.', 'Clinical Validation of a Deep-Learning Segmentation Software in Head and Neck: An Early Analysis in a Developing Radiation Oncology Center.']"""

We hypothesized that SLFN12 influences lung cancer biology. We investigated survival differences in high versus low SLFN12-expressing tumors in two databases. We then adenovirally overexpressed SLFN12 (AdSLFN12) in HCC827, H23, and H1975 cells to model lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and in H2170 and HTB-182 cells representing lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). We analyzed proliferation using a colorimetric assay, mRNA expression by RT-qPCR, and protein by Western blot. To further explore the functional relevance of SLFN12, we correlated SLFN12 with seventeen functional oncogenic gene signatures in human tumors. Low tumoral SLFN12 expression predicted worse survival in LUAD patients, but not in LUSC. AdSLFN12 modulated expression of SCGB1A1, SFTPC, HOPX, CK-5, CDH1, and P63 in a complex fashion in these cells. AdSLFN12 reduced proliferation in all LUAD cell lines, but not in LUSC cells. SLFN12 expression inversely correlated with expression of a myc-associated gene signature in LUAD, but not LUSC tumors. SLFN12 overexpression reduced c-myc protein in LUAD cell lines but not in LUSC, by inhibiting c-myc translation.

We therefore sought to determine the association between CD8 and PD-L1 expression in localized prostate tumors and biochemical recurrence (BCR) and metastasis-free survival (MFS).  Methods:   Tissue microarrays were constructed on 109 men undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) for localized prostate cancer at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute between 1991 and 2008. Fluorescence immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the expression of six immune markers (CD3, CD4, CD8, PD-1, PD-L1, FOXP3). Quantitative multispectral imaging analysis was used to calculate the density of each marker, which was dichotomized by the median as ""high"" or ""low."" Cox proportional hazards regression models and Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to analyze associations between immune marker densities and time to BCR and MFS.  Results:   Over a median follow-up of 8.1 years, 55 (51%) and 39 (36%) men developed BCR and metastases, respectively. Median time to BCR was shorter in men with low CD8 (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.27 [1.27-4.08]) and high PD-L1 expression (HR = 2.03 [1.17-3.53]). While neither low CD8 or high PD-L1 alone were independent predictors of BCR or MFS on multivariable analysis, men with low CD8 and/or high PD-L1 had a significantly shorter time to BCR (median 3.5 years vs. NR) and MFS (median 10.8 vs. 18.4 years) compared to those with high CD8 and low PD-L1 expression. The main limitation is the retrospective and singe-center nature of the study.  Conclusion:   The presence of higher CD8 and lower PD-L1 expression in prostatectomy specimens was associated a low risk of biochemical relapse and metastatic disease.

Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist used for managing chronic heart failure (HF) with known antiandrogenic effects. We examined the effect of spironolactone exposure amongst men with HF on the incidence of prostate cancer.  Methods:   This retrospective cohort study utilized provincial clinical and administrative databases from the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy. Incident cases of prostate cancer were identified from the provincial cancer registry, and spironolactone exposure was quantified from pharmacare databases. A multivariable proportional hazards model was used to assess the time-dependent impact of spironolactone exposure on prostate cancer incidence.  Results:   A total of 18 562 men with newly diagnosed HF from 2007 to 2015 with a median age of 72 years (interquartile range: 61-81) and a median follow-up from HF diagnosis to prostate cancer incidence of 2.7 years (interquartile range: 1.1-4.9) were included. A time-dependent multivariable analysis of spironolactone exposure following HF diagnosis found a reduced the risk of prostate cancer hazard ratio 0.55 (95% confidence interval 0.31-0.98, P = .043).  Conclusion:   Spironolactone exposure significantly reduced the incidence of prostate cancer amongst men with HF. These findings support the plausibility of aldosterone as a promoter of prostate cancer growth and development.

People of non-European ancestries make up less than 15% of prostate cancer GWAS subjects. Across the globe, incidence of prostate cancer varies with population due to environmental and genetic factors. The discrepancy between disease incidence and representation in genetics highlights the need for more studies of the genetic risk for prostate cancer across diverse populations. To better understand the genetic risk for prostate cancer across diverse populations, we performed PrediXcan and GWAS in a case-control study of 4,769 self-identified African American (2,463 cases and 2,306 controls), 2,199 Japanese American (1,106 cases and 1,093 controls), and 2,147 Latin American (1,081 cases and 1,066 controls) individuals from the Multiethnic Genome-wide Scan of Prostate Cancer. We used prediction models from 46 tissues in GTEx version 8 and five models from monocyte transcriptomes in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Across the three populations, we predicted 19 gene-tissue pairs, including five unique genes, to be significantly (lfsr < 0.05) associated with prostate cancer. One of these genes, NKX3-1, replicated in a larger European study. At the SNP level, 110 SNPs met genome-wide significance in the African American study while 123 SNPs met significance in the Japanese American study.

The purpose of this study was to report on patterns of palliative RT of bone metastasis in a severely low-capacity setting.  Patients and methods:   Patient and treatment characteristics of patients irradiated for palliation of symptomatic bone metastasis were extracted from a retrospective database of patients treated between May 2015 and January 2018. This database included a random sample of 1,823 of the estimated 4,000 patients who were treated with RT within in the study period. Associations between the applied RT schedule and patient and tumor characteristics were evaluated with the χ2 test. Hypothetical savings of RT sessions and time were compared in the case of a single-fraction policy.  Results:   From the database, 234 patients (13%) were treated for bone metastasis. Most patients were ≤ 65 years of age (n = 189; 80%) and female (n = 125; 53%). The most common primary sites were breast (n = 82; 35%) and prostate (n = 36; 15%). Fractionated regimens were preferred over single fraction: 20 Gy in 5 fractions (n = 192; 82.1%), 30 Gy in 10 fractions (n = 7; 3%), and 8 Gy in 1 fraction (n = 28; 12%). Factors associated with single-fraction RT included nonaxial sites of bone metastasis (P < .01) and an address outside Addis Ababa (P ≤ .01). If single-fraction RT would have been given uniformly for bone metastasis, this would have resulted in a 78% reduction in the number of RT sessions and 76% reduction in total RT time.  Conclusion:   The pattern of palliative RT for bone metastasis in Ethiopia favors fractionated regimens over single fraction.

The mechanism of KAI1 down-regulation is complex and not well understood. Here, we investigate the role of 8 SNPs (not previously studied) in KAI1 gene that could influence its expression in tumor tissue samples of breast cancer patients from the Eastern province of Saudi Arabia.  Methods:   Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in KAI1 gene were selected from the NCBI website (dbSNP) and were then filtered for those SNPs causing stop codon mutations (rs139889503 and rs150533529) or nonsynonymous mutation in the 5'-UTR (rs11541048, rs77359459, rs115500759, rs182579675, rs200238062, and rs372733853). SNPs genotyping was performed using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay and the results were correlated with KAI1 protein expression profile by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples of breast cancer and control none-neoplastic tissues.  Results:   KAI1 expression by IHC was observed in all none-neoplastic breast tissue samples and only in 35% out of the 59 breast cancer tissue samples.

Putative substrates included 22-28 antioxidant/redox-regulatory proteins, thus predicting that DHHC3 should have antioxidant functions. Consistent with this, DHHC3 ablation elevated oxidative stress. Furthermore, DHHC3 ablation, together with chemotherapeutic drug treatment, (a) elevated oxidative stress, with a greater than additive effect, and (b) enhanced the anti-growth effects of the chemotherapeutic agents. These results suggest that DHHC3 ablation enhances chemotherapeutic drug potency by disabling the antioxidant protections that contribute to drug resistance. Affirming this concept, DHHC3 ablation synergized with another anti-cancer drug, PARP inhibitor PJ-34, to decrease cell proliferation and increase oxidative stress. Hence, DHHC3 targeting can be a useful strategy for selectively enhancing potency of oxidative stress-inducing anti-cancer drugs.

Main outcomes and measures:   Receipt of conservative management and (for patients receiving conservative management) time from diagnosis to definitive therapy.  Results:   The median (interquartile range) age of the 51 543 veterans in our cohort was 65 (61-70) years, and 14 830 veterans (28.8%) were African American individuals. Compared with White veterans, African American veterans were more likely to have intermediate-risk disease (18 988 [51.7%] vs 8526 [57.5%]), 3 or more comorbidities (15 438 [42.1%] vs 7614 [51.3%]), and high disability-related or income-related needs (9078 [24.7%] vs 4614 [31.1%]). Overall, 20 606 veterans (40.0%) received conservative management. African American veterans with low-risk disease (adjusted relative risk, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92-0.98; P < .001) and intermediate-risk disease (adjusted relative risk, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87-0.97; P = .002) were less likely to receive conservative management than White veterans. Compared with White veterans, African American veterans with low-risk disease (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.50-1.95; P < .001) and intermediate-risk disease (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.27-1.69; P < .001) who received conservative management were more likely to receive definitive therapy within 5 years of diagnosis (restricted mean survival time [SE] at 5 years, 1679 [5.3] days vs 1740 [2.4] days; P < .001).  Conclusions and relevance:   In this study, conservative management was less commonly used and less durable for African American veterans than for White veterans.

Previous studies, often including men at low risk, have used magnetic resonance imaging guided biopsy to a variable extent. Here, we uniformly used the new diagnostic modality to study all men, each with clinically significant cancer, at baseline and at short and intermediate-term followup.  Materials and methods:   In an open label trial (NCT03503643) 61 men with unilateral cancer (all clinically significant, ie Grade Group 2 or greater) underwent primary hemigland cryoablation. Subjects were 80% Caucasian, average age 69 years, prostate specific antigen 6.6 ng/ml and prostate volume 38 cc. Biopsy was performed using magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound fusion prior to treatment and at the followup intervals of near-term (6 months, in 61) and intermediate-term (18 months, in 27). All utilities of fusion biopsy, ie targeting of magnetic resonance imaging visible lesions, template systematic sampling, and in followup, tracking of prior positive sites, were used throughout the study to detect clinically significant cancer, the primary end point.  Results:   Following treatment 82% of men (50 of 61) had no biopsy detectable clinically significant prostate cancer at 6-month near-term followup and 82% of men (22 of 27) reaching the 18-month intermediate-term remained biopsy negative. Combination of the 3 sampling methods provided maximal cancer detection. During followup a new focus of cancer was found in the contralateral prostate in only 1 of 27 men. No adverse events above Clavien-Dindo grade 2 were encountered.  Conclusions:   Hemigland cryoablation, when rigorously evaluated by all utilities of magnetic resonance imaging guided biopsy, appears to eliminate clinically significant cancer in 82% of men, a success rate that endures for at least 18 months.""","""['Ryan Chuang', 'Adam Kinnaird', 'Lorna Kwan', 'Anthony Sisk', 'Danielle Barsa', 'Ely Felker', 'Merdie Delfin', 'Leonard Marks']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Editorial Comment.', 'Risk of Prostate Cancer after a Negative Magnetic Resonance Imaging Guided Biopsy.', 'Phase II Evaluation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Guided Focal Laser Ablation of Prostate Cancer.', 'The Long-Term Risks of Metastases in Men on Active Surveillance for Early Stage Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeted Biopsy in Patients with a Prior Negative Biopsy: A Consensus Statement by AUA and SAR.', 'Targeted prostate biopsy and MR-guided therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Oncological outcomes of whole-gland cryoablation in patients with prostate cancer and high risk of lymph node invasion.', 'Cryotherapy for partial gland ablation of prostate cancer: Oncologic and safety outcomes.', 'Systematic Review of Focal and Salvage Cryotherapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Intraoperative Digital Analysis of Ablation Margins (DAAM) by Fluorescent Confocal Microscopy to Improve Partial Prostate Gland Cryoablation Outcomes.']"""

This provides prognostic information for a heterogeneous disease such as PCa and guides treatment selection. In this article, we hypothesize that nonclinical factors may also impact treatment selection and their adherence to treatment guidelines. A total of 552 patients with intermediate- and high-risk PCa treated with definitive radiation with or without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) between 2010 and 2017 were identified from 34 medical centers within the Veterans Health Administration. Medical charts were manually reviewed, and details regarding each patient's clinical history and treatment were extracted. Support Vector Machine and Random forest-based classification was used to identify clinical and nonclinical predictors of adherence to the treatment guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN). We created models for predicting both initial treatment intent and treatment alterations. Our results demonstrate that besides clinical factors, the center in which the patient was treated (nonclinical factor) played a significant role in adherence to NCCN guidelines. Furthermore, the treatment center served as an important predictor to decide on whether or not to prescribe ADT; however, it was not associated with ADT duration and weakly associated with treatment alterations. Such center-bias motivates further investigation on details of center-specific barriers to both NCCN guideline adherence and on oncological outcomes. In addition, we demonstrate that publicly available data sets, for example, that from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEERs), may not be well equipped to build such predictive models on treatment plans.""","""['Khajamoinuddin Syed', 'William Sleeman', 'Payal Soni', 'Michael Hagan', 'Jatinder Palta', 'Rishabh Kapoor', 'Preetam Ghosh']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Comput Biol""","""['Assessment of the Rate of Adherence to International Guidelines for Androgen Deprivation Therapy with External-beam Radiation Therapy: A Population-based Study.', 'Development and Validation of a Clinical Prognostic Stage Group System for Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer Using Disease-Specific Mortality Results From the International Staging Collaboration for Cancer of the Prostate.', 'Guideline-discordant androgen deprivation therapy in localized prostate cancer: patterns of use in the medicare population and cost implications.', 'Role of combined radiation and androgen deprivation therapy in intermediate-risk prostate cancer : Statement from the DEGRO working group on prostate cancer.', 'Contemporary grading for prostate cancer: implications for patient care.', 'Renal cancer: From current evidence to future perspectives.']"""

Twenty-five patient were randomized to NeuroSAFE RARP (intervention arm) and 24 to standard RARP (control arm). Frozen section was compared to final paraffin section margin assessment in the 25 patients in the NeuroSAFE arm. Operation timings and complications were collected prospectively in both arms.  Results:   Fifty neurovascular bundles (NVBs) from 25 patients in the NeuroSAFE arm were analysed. When analysed by each pathological section (n = 250, average five per side), we noted a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 99.2%, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.994 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.985 to 1; P ≤0.001). On an NVB basis (n = 50), sensitivity was 100%, specificity was 92.7%, and the AUC was 0.963 (95% CI 0.914 to 1; P ≤0.001).

Methods:   Cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT assay, while cell proliferation was measured by trypan blue exclusion method. Cell migration was measured by wound healing assay, and DAPI staining was used to evaluate apoptotic nucleus morphology.

Our study aimed to determine the expression profile of DARS-AS1 in prostate cancer (PCa) tissues and cell lines. Functional experiments were conducted to explore the detailed roles of DARS-AS1 in regulating PCa carcinogenesis. Furthermore, the detailed mechanisms by which DARS-AS1 regulates the oncogenicity of PCa cells were uncovered.  Methods:   Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to analyze DARS-AS1 expression in PCa tissues and cell lines. Cell Counting Kit-8 assays, flow cytometry analyses, Transwell assays, and tumor xenograft experiments were conducted to determine the regulatory effects of DARS-AS1 knockdown on the malignant phenotype of PCa cells. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to identify putative microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting DARS-AS1, and the direct interaction between DARS-AS1 and miR-628-5p was verified using RNA immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays.  Results:   DARS-AS1 was highly expressed in PCa tissues and cell lines. In vitro functional experiments demonstrated that DARS-AS1 depletion suppressed PCa cell proliferation, promoted cell apoptosis, and restricted cell migration and invasion. In vivo studies revealed that the downregulation of DARS-AS1 inhibited PCa tumor growth in nude mice. Mechanistic investigation verified that DARS-AS1 functioned as an endogenous miR-628-5p sponge in PCa cells and consequently promoted the expression of metadherin (MTDH). Furthermore, the involvement of miR-628-5p/MTDH axis in DARS-AS1-mediated regulatory actions in PCa cells was verified using rescue experiments.  Conclusion:   DARS-AS1 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA in PCa by adsorbing miR-628-5p and thereby increasing the expression of MTDH, resulting in enhanced PCa progression. The identification of a novel DARS-AS1/miR-628-5p/MTDH regulatory network in PCa cells may offer a new theoretical basis for the development of promising therapeutic targets.""","""['Haitao Fan', 'Junhui Hou', 'Siqing Liu', 'Zuomin Xiao', 'Jia Cui']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Cancer Manag Res""","""['Long Non-Coding RNA DARS-AS1 Contributes to Prostate Cancer Progression Through Regulating the MicroRNA-628-5p/MTDH Axis Retraction.', 'Long non-coding RNA A1BG-AS1 promotes tumorigenesis in breast cancer by sponging microRNA-485-5p and consequently increasing expression of FLOT1 expression.', 'Long Noncoding RNA LIPE-AS1 Drives Prostate Cancer Progression by Functioning as a Competing Endogenous RNA for microRNA-654-3p and Thereby Upregulating Hepatoma-Derived Growth Factor.', 'Knockdown of long noncoding RNA TP73-AS1 suppresses the malignant progression of breast cancer cells in vitro through targeting miRNA-125a-3p/metadherin axis.', 'Long Non-Coding RNA AGAP2-AS1/miR-628-5p/PTN Axis Modulates Proliferation, Migration, Invasion, and Apoptosis of Glioma Cells.', 'Long non-coding RNA PRNCR1 modulates non-small cell lung cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, and EMT through PRNCR1/miR-126-5p/MTDH axis.', 'DARS-AS1 modulates cell proliferation and migration of gastric cancer cells by regulating miR-330-3p/NAT10 axis.', 'Genetic Basis of Follicle Development in Dazu Black Goat by Whole-Transcriptome Sequencing.', 'Treatment-emergent and trajectory-based peripheral gene expression markers of antidepressant response.', 'The Role of Androgens and Androgen Receptor in Human Bladder Cancer.']"""

These are highly dynamic structures comprising of α-tubulin and β-tubulin which are usually heterodimers and found to be involved in cell movement, intracellular trafficking, and mitosis inhibition of which might kill the tumour cells or inhibit the abnormal proliferation of cells. Most of the tubulin polymerization inhibitors, such as Vinca alkaloids, consist of Indole as the main scaffold. The literature also suggests using triazole moiety in the chemical entities, potentiating the inhibitory activity against cell proliferation. So, in our study, we used indole triazole scaffolds to synthesize the derivatives against tubulin polymerization.  Objective:   The main objective of this study to synthesize indole triazole conjugates by using environmentally friendly solvents (green chemistry) and click chemistry. To carry out the MTT assay and tubulin polymerization assay for the synthesized indole triazole conjugates.  Methods:   All the synthesized molecules were subjected to molecular docking studies using Schrodinger suite and the structural confirmation was performed by Mass, proton-NMR and carbon-NMR, documented in DMSO and CDCL3. Biological studies were performed using DU145 (prostate cancer), A-549 (lung cancer) and, MCF-7 (breast cancer), cell lines obtained from ATCC were maintained as a continuous culture. MTT assay was performed for the analogues using standard protocol. Cell cycle analysis was carried out using flow cytometry.  Results:   The Indole triazole scaffolds were synthesized using the principles of Green chemistry. The triazole formation is mainly achieved by using the Click chemistry approach. Structural elucidation of synthesized compounds was performed using Mass spectroscopy (HR-MS), Proton-Nuclear Magnetic Spectroscopy (1H-NMR) and Carbon-Nuclear Magnetic Spectroscopy (13C-NMR). The XP-docked poses and free energy binding calculations revealed that 2c and 2g molecules exhibited the highest docking affinity against the tubulin-colchicine domain (PDB:1SA0). In vitro cytotoxic assessment revealed that 2c and 2g displayed promising cytotoxicity in MTT assay (with CTC50 values 3.52μM and 2.37μM) which are in good agreement with the computational results. 2c and 2g also arrested 63 and 66% of cells in the G2/M phase, respectively, in comparison to control cells (10%) and tubulin polymerization inhibition assay revealed that 2c and 2g exhibited significant inhibition of tubulin polymerization with IC50 values of 2.31μM, and 2.62μM, respectively in comparison to Nocodazole, a positive control, resulted in an IC50 value of 2.51μM.  Conclusion:   Indole triazole hybrids were synthesized using click chemistry, and docking studies were carried out using Schrodinger for the designed molecules. Process Optimization has been done for both the schemes. Twelve compounds (2a-2l) have been successfully synthesized and analytical evaluation was performed using NMR and HR-MS. In vitro evaluation was for the synthesized molecules to check tubulin polymerization inhibition for antiproliferative action. Among the synthesized compounds, 2c and 2g have potent anticancer activities by inhibiting tubulin polymerization.""","""['Vidyasrilekha Yele', 'Sai Kiran S S Pindiprolu', 'Sravani Sana', 'D S V N M Ramamurty', 'Jayanthi R K Madasi', 'Swapna Vadlamani']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Anticancer Agents Med Chem""","""['Synthesis and biological evaluation of 1,2,3-triazole linked aminocombretastatin conjugates as mitochondrial mediated apoptosis inducers.', '1,2,3-triazole tethered Indole-3-glyoxamide derivatives as multiple inhibitors of 5-LOX, COX-2 & tubulin: Their anti-proliferative & anti-inflammatory activity.', 'Design and discovery of new antiproliferative 1,2,4-triazin-3(2H)-ones as tubulin polymerization inhibitors targeting colchicine binding site.', 'Indole derivatives\xa0(2010-2020)\xa0as\xa0versatile tubulin inhibitors: synthesis and structure-activity relationships.', 'Indole-Based Tubulin Inhibitors: Binding Modes and SARs Investigations.', 'Design and Synthesis of Some New Furan-Based Derivatives and Evaluation of In Vitro Cytotoxic Activity.', 'Associations between TUBB-WWOX SNPs, their haplotypes, gene-gene, and gene-environment interactions and dyslipidemia.']"""
