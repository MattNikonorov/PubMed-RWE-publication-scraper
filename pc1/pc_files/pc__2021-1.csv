Methods:   Ten patients with metastatic prostate cancer underwent 99mTc-PSMA whole-body scan after intravenous injection of 230-330 MBq 99mTc-PSMA. Anterior and posterior whole-body images were acquired at 10 min, 2, 4 and/or 5/6 h post-injection. Additional SPECT/CT images were acquired for the involved sites, where planar images did not clearly identify the metastatic sites. All patients also underwent whole-body 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT and the results between the two techniques were compared for the detection of the metastatic lesions. Dosimetry analysis of the 99mTc-PSMA studies was performed using the MIRD-OLINDA approach.  Results:   68Ga-PSMA PET/CT detected lesions in all 10 patients, whereas 99mTc-PSMA imaging detected lesions in 9/10 patients. 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT imaging identified a total of 112 PSMA avid metastatic lesions compared to 57 (51%) lesions on 99mTc-PSMA imaging. Eighteen out of 57 lesions were detected only on delayed 99mTc-PSMA imaging at 4 h and/or 6 h. The regional 99mTc-PSMA SPECT detected 51/83 (61.0%) lesions seen on 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT. The dosimetry results demonstrated that 99mTc-PSMA provided organs' radiation absorbed/effective doses comparable with 99mTc-PSMA imaging.  Conclusion:   Whole-body 99mTc-PSMA combined with regional SPECT/CT could be a potential alternative to 68Ga-PSMA PET for the detection of the advanced stage metastatic prostate cancer and for response evaluation to PSMA-based targeted therapies.""","""['Baljinder Singh', 'Sarika Sharma', 'Parul Bansal', 'Monika Hooda', 'Harmandeep Singh', 'Ashwin Singh Parihar', 'Ajay Kumar', 'Ankit Watts', 'Ravi Mohan', 'Shrawan K Singh']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Nucl Med Commun""","""['99mTc-PSMA SPECT/CT Versus 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in the Evaluation of Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'A Prospective Comparison of 18F-prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-1007 Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography, Whole-body 1.5 T Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Diffusion-weighted Imaging, and Single-photon Emission Computed Tomography/Computed Tomography with Traditional Imaging in Primary Distant Metastasis Staging of Prostate Cancer (PROSTAGE).', 'Head-To-Head Comparison of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and 99mTc-MDP Bone Scintigraphy for the Detection of Bone Metastases in Patients With Prostate Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Performance of 68Ga-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen ligand positron emission tomography/computed tomography in the diagnosis of primary prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'A Review on the Current State and Future Perspectives of 99mTcTc-Housed PSMA-i in Prostate Cancer.', 'Molecular Imaging in Primary Staging of Prostate Cancer Patients: Current Aspects and Future Trends.']"""

Among other surgical techniques, restorative ultralow rectal anterior resection may be an option of last resort to achieve fistula closure avoiding the need for a permanent stoma. This article aims to describe a transanal minimally invasive-assisted Turnbull-Cutait technique for radiated rectourethral fistulas with a complementary video.  Technique:   Turnbull-Cutait pull-through with delayed coloanal anastomosis technique with a proctectomy by transanal minimally invasive surgery and loop ileostomy was performed in 3 patients who developed delayed rectourethral fistula after prostate cancer treatment. Ileostomy was reversed after fistula closure confirmation.  Results:   The first patient had brachytherapy with no surgery. The second patient had radical prostatectomy and adjuvant radiotherapy, developing the fistula after a pelvic abscess drained transrectally. The third patient underwent prostatectomy and brachytherapy, developing the fistula after transanal endoscopic microsurgery resection of a rectal villous polyp. Surgical intervention and postoperative recovery was uneventful. Fistula closure was confirmed in the 3 cases, and all ileostomies were closed without further recurrence at follow-up.  Conclusions:   Transanal minimally invasive proctectomy-assisted Turnbull-Cutait procedure for the treatment of rectourethral fistula is a new combination of already existing techniques, enabling the creation of safe colorectal anastomosis in high-risk cases. Given the difficulty obtaining healing with sphincter preservation in cases of postradiation rectourethral fistula, this technique aids in fistula closure and restoration of the intestinal continuity, and potentially represents an added resource in the surgical armamentarium for this challenging pathology.""","""['Beatriz Martín-Pérez', 'Ron Dar', 'Gabriele Bislenghi', 'Jasper Stijns', 'Tine Grégoir', 'Albert M Wolthuis', 'André D Hoore']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Dis Colon Rectum""","""['Two-Stage Turnbull-Cutait Pull-Through Coloanal Anastomosis for Low Rectal Cancer: A Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'Minimally Invasive Transanal Repair of Rectourethral Fistulas.', 'Two-stage Turnbull-Cutait pull-through coloanal anastomosis versus coloanal anastomosis with protective loop ileostomy for low rectal cancer.

It may be asymptomatic at the early stage. In this paper, we propose a methodology aimed to detect the prostate cancer grade by computing non-invasive shape-based radiomic features directly from magnetic resonance images.  Materials and methods:   We use a freely available dataset composed by coronal magnetic resonance images belonging to 112 patients. We represent magnetic resonance slices in terms of formal model, and we exploit model checking to check whether a set of properties (formulated with the support of pathologists and radiologists) is verified on the formal model. Each property is related to a different cancer grade with the aim to cover all the cancer grade groups.  Results:   An average specificity equal to 0.97 and an average sensitivity equal to 1 have been obtained with our methodology.

Results:   Men experienced bowel, sexual, and urinary side effects, mostly in the short term but some persisted and were bothersome. Most men downplayed the impacts, voicing expectations of age-related decline, and normalizing these changes. There was some reticence to seek help, with men prioritizing their relationships and overall health and well-being over returning to pretreatment levels of function. Some unmet needs with regard to information about treatment schedules and side effects were reported, particularly among men with continuing functional symptoms.

Methods:   The study was performed during the ''Transurethral resection (TUR) module"" at the boot camp held in 2019. Prior to the course, all trainees were required to evaluate their experience in performing TURBT and TURP procedures. Trainees simulated resection on two different models; low-fidelity tissue model (Samed, GmBH, Dresden, Germany) and virtual reality simulator (TURPMentor, 3D Systems, Littleton, US). Following the completion of the module, trainees completed a questionnaire using a 5-point Likert scale to evaluate their assessment of the models for surgical training.  Results:   In total, 174 simulation assessments were performed by 56 trainees (Samed Bladder-40, Prostate-45, TURPMentor Bladder-51, Prostate-37). All trainees reported that they had performed < 50 TUR procedures. The Samed model median scores were for appearance (4/5), texture (5/5), feel (5/5) and conductibility (5/5). The TURPMentor median score was for appearance (4/5), texture and feel (4/5) and conductibility (4/5). The most common criticism of the Samed model was that it failed to mimic bleeding. In contrast, trainees felt that the TURPMentor haptic feedback was inadequate to allow for close resection and did not calibrate movements accurately.  Conclusions:   Our results demonstrate that both forms of simulators (low-fidelity and virtual reality) were rated highly by urology trainees and improve their confidence in performing transurethral resection and in fact complement each other in providing lower tract endoscopic resection simulation.""","""['Christopher Berridge', 'Mithun Kailavasan', 'Grigorios Athanasiadis', 'Agapios Gkentzis', 'Tariq Tassadaq', 'Victor Palit', 'Bhavan Rai', 'Chandra S Biyani', 'Ghulam Nabi']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Design, implementation, and evaluation of a novel curriculum to teach transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP): a 3-year experience of urology simulation bootcamp course.', 'Validation of a High-End Virtual Reality Simulator for Training Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumors.', 'Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumors: Next-generation Virtual Reality Training for Surgeons.', 'Role of transurethral resection of the prostate simulators for training in transurethral surgery.', 'Simulation training in transurethral resection/laser vaporization of the prostate; evidence from a systematic review by the European Section of Uro-Technology.', 'Endoscopic submucosal dissection training: evaluation of an ex vivo training model with continuous perfusion (ETM-CP) for hands-on teaching and training in China.', 'The use of a surgical boot camp combining anatomical education and surgical simulation for internship preparedness among senior medical students.', 'Surgical skills and COVID-19 pandemic: Impact and way forward.']"""

Herein, we investigated whether peripheral monocyte count can predict long-term PC outcomes after RP in black and white men.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed data on 2345 men undergoing RP from 2000 to 2017 at eight Veterans Affairs hospitals. Data on monocyte count within 6 and 12 months prior to surgery were collected.

Improving the circulation of radioligands in the blood is considered as an effective strategy that can improve tumor burden, which benefits detection of small lesions and improves the effect of PSMA radioligand therapy (PRLT). In this study, we introduced maleimidopropionic acid (MPA) to a PSMA-targeted tracer and developed Al18F-PSMA-CM, which targets human serum albumin (HSA) binding and PSMA. Al18F-PSMA-CM is evaluated in vitro and in vivo for stability, PSMA specificity, and biodistribution in 22Rv1 tumor-bearing mice. Al18F-PSMA-CM was prepared with a radiochemical purity of >99% and specific activity of 11.22-18.70 MBq/nmol. Al18F-PSMA-CM was stable in vitro and in vivo and prolonged circulation in blood with a binding ratio of 47 ± 3.2% and Kd value of 3.08 ± 0.45 nM to HSA. The uptake of Al18F-PSMA-CM in PSMA(+) 22Rv1 cells was increased in 2 h, and the uptake was blocked by a PSMA inhibitor, ZJ-43. The Kd value of Al18F-PSMA-CM to PSMA was 8.46 ± 0.24 nM. Al18F-PSMA-CM was accumulated in kidneys and 22Rv1 tumors [74.76 ± 15.42 and 6.16 ± 0.74 ID%/g at 2 h post injection (p.i.)], which were decreased by -80.0 and -84.3% when co-injected with ZJ-43.

The visualization of these tumors during surgery via near infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging would greatly enhance surgical resection, minimizing tumor recurrence and improving outcome. Furthermore, chemotherapy is typically administered to patients after surgery to treat any missed tumor tissue around the surgical area, minimizing metastasis and increasing patient survival. For these reasons, a theranostics fluorescent nanoparticle could be developed to assist in the visualization of PCa tumor margins, while also delivering chemotherapeutic drug after surgery. Methods: Ferumoxytol (FMX) conjugated to the fluorescent dye and PCa targeting agent, heptamethine carbocyanine (HMC), yielded the HMC-FMX nanoprobe that was tested in vitro with various PCa cell lines and in vivo with both subcutaneous and orthotopic PCa mouse models. Visualization of these tumors via NIRF imaging after administration of HMC-FMX was performed. In addition, delivery of chemotherapeutic drug and their effect on tumor growth was also assessed. Results: HMC-FMX internalized into PCa cells, labeling these cells and PCa tumors in mice with near infrared fluorescence, facilitating tumor margin visualization. HMC-FMX was also able to deliver drugs to these tumors, reducing cell migration and slowing down tumor growth. Conclusion: HMC-FMX specifically targeted PCa tumors in mice allowing for the visualization of tumor margins by NIRF imaging. Furthermore, delivery of anticancer drugs by HMC-FMX effectively reduced prostate tumor growth and reduced cell migration in vitro. Thus, HMC-FMX can potentially translate into the clinic as a nanotheranostics agent for the intraoperative visualization of PCa tumor margins, and post-operative treatment of tumors with HMC-FMX loaded with anticancer drugs.""","""['James Teh', 'Manisha Tripathi', 'Derek Reichel', 'Bien Sagong', 'Ricardo Montoya', 'Yi Zhang', 'Shawn Wagner', 'Rola Saouaf', 'Leland W K Chung', 'J Manuel Perez']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Nanotheranostics""","""['Near Infrared Fluorescent Nanoplatform for Targeted Intraoperative Resection and Chemotherapeutic Treatment of Glioblastoma.', 'Novel Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor Targeted Near-Infrared Fluorescence Dye for Image-Guided Surgery of Prostate Cancer.', 'Hyaluronic acid formulation of near infrared fluorophores optimizes surgical imaging in a prostate tumor xenograft.', 'Heptamethine Cyanine-Based Application for Cancer Theranostics.', 'PSMA-targeting agents for radio- and fluorescence-guided prostate cancer surgery.']"""

Simultaneous targeting of AR-FL and AR-V7 may be a promising strategy to overcome resistance to hormone therapy. This study aimed to identify novel drug candidates co-targeting AR-FL and AR-V7 activities and elucidate their molecular mechanism of anti-CRPC activities. Methods: Using a CRPC cell-based reporter assay system, we screened a small library of antimalarial agents to explore the possibility of repositioning them for CRPC treatment and identified bruceantin (BCT) as a potent anti-CRPC drug candidate. A series of cell-based, molecular, biochemical, and in vivo approaches were performed to evaluate the therapeutic potential and molecular mechanism of BCT in CRPC. These approaches include reporter gene assays, cell proliferation, RNA-seq, qRT-PCR, mouse xenografts, co-immunoprecipitation, GST pull-down, immobilized BCT pull-down, molecular modeling, and bioinformatic analyses. Results: We identified BCT as a highly potent inhibitor co-targeting AR-FL and AR-V7 activity. BCT inhibits the transcriptional activity of AR-FL/AR-V7 and downregulates their target genes in CRPC cells. In addition, BCT efficiently suppresses tumor growth and metastasis of CRPC cells. Mechanistically, BCT disrupts the interaction of HSP90 with AR-FL/AR-V7 by directly binding to HSP90 and inhibits HSP90 chaperone function, leading to degradation of AR-FL/AR-V7 through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Clinically, HSP90 expression is upregulated and correlated with AR/AR-V7 levels in CRPC. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that BCT could serve as a promising therapeutic candidate against CRPC and highlight the potential benefit of targeting AR-FL/AR-V7-HSP90 axis to overcome resistance caused by aberrant AR-FL/AR-V7 signaling.""","""['Sue Jin Moon', 'Byong Chang Jeong', 'Hwa Jin Kim', 'Joung Eun Lim', 'Hye-Jeong Kim', 'Ghee Young Kwon', 'Joshua A Jackman', 'Jeong Hoon Kim']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Targeting the KIF4A/AR Axis to Reverse Endocrine Therapy Resistance in Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Co-targeting AR and HSP90 suppresses prostate cancer cell growth and prevents resistance mechanisms.', 'Ailanthone targets p23 to overcome MDV3100 resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Interference with the androgen receptor protein stability in therapy-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor splicing variant 7: Beyond being a constitutively active variant.', 'Using the AR-V7 biomarker to determine treatment in metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer, a feasibility randomised control trial, conclusions from the VARIANT trial version 2; peer review: 2 approved.', 'Biosynthesis of anticancer phytochemical compounds and their chemistry.', 'A compendium of Androgen Receptor Variant 7 target genes and their role in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen Receptor Signaling Inhibition in Advanced Castration Resistance Prostate Cancer: What Is Expected for the Near Future?', 'The Crucial Role of AR-V7 in Enzalutamide-Resistance of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

However, due to increased intratumoural androgen synthesis and AR variation, PCa progresses to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which ultimately becomes resistant to endocrine therapy. A search for new therapeutic perspectives is urgently needed. Methods: By screening lipid metabolism-related gene sets and bioinformatics analysis in prostate cancer database, we identified the key lipid metabolism-related genes in PCa. Bisulfite genomic Sequence Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) (BSP) and Methylation-Specific Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) (MSP) were preformed to detect the promoter methylation of ACSS3. Gene expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR, Western blotting, IHC and co-IP. The function of ACSS3 in PCa was measured by CCK-8, Transwell assays. LC/MS, Oil Red O assays and TG and cholesterol measurement assays were to detect the levels of TG and cholesterol in cells. Resistance to Enzalutamide in C4-2 ENZR cells was examined in a xenograft tumorigenesis model in vivo. Results: We found that acyl-CoA synthetase short chain family member 3 (ACSS3) was downregulated and predicted a poor prognosis in PCa. Loss of ACSS3 expression was due to gene promoter methylation. Restoration of ACSS3 expression in PCa cells significantly reduced LD deposits, thus promoting apoptosis by increasing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and decreasing de novo intratumoral androgen synthesis, inhibiting CRPC progression and reversing Enzalutamide resistance. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that ACSS3 reduced LD deposits by regulating the stability of the LD coat protein perilipin 3 (PLIN3).

Also, mito-ATP production, mitochondrial staining, and mtDNA, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+/NADH), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were detected. Results: ACACA was expressed more strongly in prostate cancer tissues. The expression level of ACACA was higher in patients with advanced PCa than in patients with lower grades. The proliferation ability reduced in ACACA-knockdown cells. In in vivo tests, the tumor volume and weight were lower in the experimental group than in the control group. Mito-ATP production decreased significantly after ACACA suppression, mtDNA levels and MitoTracker staining decreased in the experimental group.

After predicting the downstream genes of these miRNAs, the miRNA-mRNA network was visualized by Cytoscape software. In addition, pathway analyses found that the differences between two groups were mainly enriched on tumor progression and drug resistance-related pathways.

A limited number of studies examining statins in advanced stages report positive results, with a few specifically examining statins and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).  Objective:   To perform a post hoc secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of men initiating ADT to examine the association between statin use and outcomes.  Design, setting, and participants:   Patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >3 ng/ml >1 yr following primary/salvage radiotherapy were enrolled in an RCT of intermittent androgen deprivation (IAD) versus continuous ADT (NCT00003653). Baseline and on-study statin use was modelled as a time-dependent covariate.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary endpoint was overall survival. Models were adjusted for age, time from radiotherapy to ADT, baseline PSA, and prior ADT.  Results and limitations:   Of 1364 patients, statin users (585; 43%) were younger (72.7 vs 73.8 yr, p = 0.001) and less likely to have PSA >15 ng/ml (20% vs 25%, p = 0.04). After a median follow-up of 6.9 yr, statin use was associated with reduced overall (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53-0.78, p < 0.001) and PCa-specific (HR: 0.65, 95% CI 0.48-0.87, p = 0.004) mortality. Statin users had 13% longer time to castration resistance, but this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.15). As an exploratory endpoint, in the IAD arm, statin users had longer time off treatment (median: 0.85 vs 0.64 yr, p = 0.06). Limitations include potential for residual confounding between statin users and nonusers, and confounding by indication.  Conclusions:   In men treated with ADT following primary or salvage radiotherapy, statin use was associated with improved overall and PCa-specific survival. In patients treated with IAD, statin use was associated with a trend towards longer time off treatment. A prospective trial of statins in men commencing ADT is warranted.

However, little is known about whether dysregulation among E2Fs, CDKs, circRNAs and miRNAs occurs in human PCa.  Methods:   The expression levels of CDK13 in PCa tissues and different cell lines were determined by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. In vitro and in vivo assays were preformed to explore the biological effects of CDK13 in PCa cells. Co-immunoprecipitation anlysis coupled with mass spectrometry was used to identify E2F5 interaction with CDK13. A CRISPR-Cas9 complex was used to activate endogenous CDK13 and circCDK13 expression. Furthermore, the mechanism of circCDK13 was investigated by using loss-of-function and gain-of-function assays in vitro and in vivo.  Results:   Here we show that CDK13 is significantly upregulated in human PCa tissues. CDK13 depletion and overexpression in PCa cells decrease and increase, respectively, cell proliferation, and the pro-proliferation effect of CDK13 is strengthened by its interaction with E2F5. Mechanistically, transcriptional activation of endogenous CDK13, but not the forced expression of CDK13 by its expression vector, remarkably promotes E2F5 protein expression by facilitating circCDK13 formation. Further, the upregulation of E2F5 enhances CDK13 transcription and promotes circCDK13 biogenesis, which in turn sponges miR-212-5p/449a and thus relieves their repression of the E2F5 expression, subsequently leading to the upregulation of E2F5 expression and PCa cell proliferation.

Here we found ASC-J9® could also suppress the PCa progression via an AR-independent mechanism, which might involve modulating the tumor suppressor ATF3 expression.  Methods:   The lentiviral system was used to modify gene expression in C4-2, CWR22Rv1 and PC-3 cells. Western blot and Immunohistochemistry were used to detect protein expression. MTT and Transwell assays were used to test the proliferation and invasion ability.  Results:   ASC-J9® can suppress PCa cell proliferation and invasion in both PCa C4-2 and CWR22Rv1 cells via altering the ATF3 expression. Further mechanistic studies reveal that ASC-J9® can increase the ATF3 expression via decreasing Glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic (GCLC) subunit expression, which can then lead to decrease the PTK2 expression. Human clinical studies further linked the ATF3 expression to the PCa progression. Preclinical studies using in vivo mouse model also proved ASC-J9® could suppress AR-independent PCa cell invasion, which could be reversed after suppressing ATF3.  Conclusions:   ASC-J9® can function via altering ATF3/PTK2 signaling to suppress the PCa progression in an AR-independent manner.""","""['Hao Tian', 'Fu-Ju Chou', 'Jing Tian', 'Yong Zhang', 'Bosen You', 'Chi-Ping Huang', 'Shuyuan Yeh', 'Yuanjie Niu', 'Chawnshang Chang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['ASC-J9® suppresses prostate cancer cell invasion via altering the sumoylation-phosphorylation of STAT3.', 'Androgen receptor (AR) degradation enhancer ASC-J9® in an FDA-approved formulated solution suppresses castration resistant prostate cancer cell growth.', 'ASC-J9(®), and not Casodex or Enzalutamide, suppresses prostate cancer stem/progenitor cell invasion via altering the EZH2-STAT3 signals.', 'A review of the effects and molecular mechanisms of dimethylcurcumin (ASC-J9) on androgen receptor-related diseases.', 'Stromal androgen receptor roles in the development of normal prostate, benign prostate hyperplasia, and prostate cancer.', 'Functional and clinical characteristics of focal adhesion kinases in cancer progression.', 'Anti-Androgen Receptor Therapies in Prostate Cancer: A Brief Update and Perspective.', 'A Promising Anticancer Agent Dimethoxycurcumin: Aspects of Pharmacokinetics, Efficacy, Mechanism, and Nanoformulation for Drug Delivery.', 'Recent advances on the mechanisms of kidney stone formation (Review).']"""

Methods:   We identified 350 patients who underwent RP, between 2013 and 2018, and had adverse pathological features (positive margin, and/or pT3a or higher) on final pathology. Genomic profile was available for all these men. The clinical recurrence-free survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The external validity of the nomogram was tested using the concordance index (c-index), calibration plot, and decision curve analysis.  Results:   The median follow-up of the cohort was 26.5 months. Overall, 14% of the patients received aRT. During the follow-up period, 3.4% of the patients developed metastasis. Overall 3-year metastasis-free survival was 95% (95% CI 0.92-0.98). The c-index of the nomogram was 0.84. The calibration of the model was favorable. Decision-curve analysis showed a positive net benefit for probabilities ranging between 0.01 and 0.09, with the highest difference at threshold probability around 0.05. At that threshold, the net benefit is 0.06 for the model and 0 for treating all the patients.  Conclusion:   Our report is the first to confirm the validity of this genomic-based risk-stratification tool in identifying men who might benefit from aRT after RP. As such, it can be a useful instrument to be incorporated in shared decision making on whether administration of aRT will lead to a clinically meaningful benefit.

All the patients were classified into three different AQS categories (low, intermediate, high) based on the quality of the anastomosis. The postoperative management was modulated accordingly.  Results:   We enrolled 333 patients. According to AQS, no differences were recorded in intraoperative complications (p = 0.9).

To reliably detect changes in signal due to treatment response, predictive models require qMRI parameters with high repeatability and reproducibility. The purpose of this study was to measure qMRI parameter uncertainties in both commercial and in-house developed phantoms to guide the development of robust predictive models for monitoring treatment response.  Materials and methods:   ADC, T1, and R2* values were acquired across three 3 T scanners with a prostate-specific qMRI protocol using the NIST/ISMRM system phantom, RSNA/NIST diffusion phantom, and an in-house phantom. A B1 field map was acquired to correct for flip angle inhomogeneity in T1 maps. All sequences were repeated in each scan to assess within-session repeatability. Weekly scans were acquired on one scanner for three months with the in-house phantom. Between-session repeatability was measured with test-retest scans 6-months apart on all scanners with all phantoms. Accuracy, defined as percentage deviation from reference value for ADC and T1, was evaluated using the system and diffusion phantoms. Repeatability and reproducibility coefficients of variation (%CV) were calculated for all qMRI parameters on all phantoms.  Results:   Overall, repeatability CV of ADC was <2.40%, reproducibility CV was <3.98%, and accuracy ranged between -8.0% to 2.7% across all scanners. Applying B1 correction on T1 measurements significantly improved the repeatability and reproducibility (p<0.05) but increased error in accuracy (p<0.001).

The aim of this study was to assess the long-term impact of the side effects of radical prostatectomy, brachytherapy, and external radiation therapy on patients with localized prostate cancer at 10 years, using propensity score analyses.  Methods and materials:   This was a prospective observational study of a cohort of men who received a diagnosis of clinically localized prostate cancer (clinical stage T1 or T2, low and intermediate risk group) and were treated with radical prostatectomy (n = 139), brachytherapy (n = 317), or external radiation therapy (n = 194). Treatment decisions were jointly made by patients and physicians. Patient-reported outcome (PRO) evaluation included the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite and Short Form-36, administered centrally by telephone interviews before and annually after treatment. The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite covers urinary, bowel, sexual, and hormonal domains. To assess PRO changes over time, while accounting for correlation among repeated measures, generalized estimating equation models adjusted by propensity scores were constructed.  Results:   The PRO completion rate at 10 years was 85.8%. Generalized estimating equation models showed that the pattern of radical prostatectomy side effects, with substantial urinary incontinence and sexual dysfunction, remained until 10 years after treatment (standard deviation [SD], -1.1 and -1.3, respectively). Brachytherapy produced late deterioration in urinary continence (SD, -0.4) and sexual function (SD, -0.9) that appeared midterm, but the differences from radical prostatectomy remained statistically significant at 10 years (P < .001 after adjusting by propensity score). External radiation therapy showed similar results to brachytherapy, but with bowel bother (SD, -0.3).  Conclusions:   Although late deterioration in radiation therapy groups attenuated differences from radical prostatectomy, relevant PRO differences still remained after 10 years. Our findings support that brachytherapy is the treatment option that causes the least impact on PROs; it is therefore an alternative to be considered when making evidence-based decisions on localized prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Olatz Garin', 'José Francisco Suárez', 'Ferran Guedea', 'Àngels Pont', 'Yolanda Pardo', 'Alai Goñi', 'Alfonso Mariño', 'Asunción Hervás', 'Ismael Herruzo', 'Patricia Cabrera', 'Gemma Sancho', 'Javier Ponce de León', 'Víctor Macías', 'Cristina Gutierrez', 'Manel Castells', 'Montse Ferrer;Multicentric Spanish Group of Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Quality of Life After Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Patient-reported Outcomes After External Beam Radiotherapy With Low Dose Rate Brachytherapy Boost vs Radical Prostatectomy for Localized Prostate Cancer: Five-year Results From a Prospective Comparative Effectiveness Study.', 'Quality of life impact of treatments for localized prostate cancer: cohort study with a 5 year follow-up.', 'Health-related quality of life 2 years after treatment with radical prostatectomy, prostate brachytherapy, or external beam radiotherapy in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Is brachytherapy comparable with radical prostatectomy and external-beam radiation for clinically localized prostate cancer?', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'A Contemporary Report of Low-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy for Prostate Cancer Using MRI for Risk Stratification: Disease Outcomes and Patient-Reported Quality of Life.', 'Postprostatectomy Radiation Therapy in the Setting of a Rectal Vascular Malformation.', 'Mortality and biochemical recurrence after surgery, brachytherapy, or external radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer: a 10-year follow-up cohort study.']"""

Our clinical phase І trial of WBM powder in patients with biochemically recurrent PCa indicated that WBM intake reduced the circulating levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). We hypothesized that WBM exerts its effects on PCa through the androgen receptor (AR) signaling axis. Therefore, we conducted a reverse translational study with androgen-dependent PCa cell lines (LNCaP and VCaP) and patient-derived-xenografts (PDX) from a prostate tumor (TM00298). In both LNCaP and VCaP cells, western blots and qRT-PCR assays indicated that WBM extract (6-30 mg/mL) suppressed DHT-induced PSA expression and cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Immunofluorescence analysis of AR revealed that WBM extract interrupted the AR nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution. PSA promotor-luciferase assay suggested that WBM extract inhibited DHT-induced luciferase activity. RNA-Seq on WBM-treated LNCaP cells confirmed that WBM treatment suppressed the androgen response pathways and cell-cycle control pathways. Our PDX showed that oral intake of WBM extract (200 mg/kg/d) suppressed tumor growth and decreased PSA levels in both tumors and serum. In the present study, we also identified a conjugated linoleic acid isomer (CLA-9Z11E) as a strong AR antagonist by performing LanthaScreen TR-FRET AR Coactivator Interaction Assays. The inhibitory effect of CLA-9Z11E (IC50: 350 nM) was nearly two times stronger than the known AR antagonist, cyproterone acetate (IC50: 672 nM).

Methods:   We performed a retrospective cohort study including veterans age 65+ with localized prostate cancer who resided in a VA nursing facility while receiving prostate radiation from 2005 to 2015. We evaluated the change in Minimum Data Set (MDS) activities of daily living (ADL) score during 6 months from the start of treatment. Because prior studies have shown Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) to be a strong predictor of treatment-related toxicity, analysis included interaction with CCI.  Results:   We identified 487 patients with median age 73 (range 65-94). For the average patient in our cohort, the predicted MDS-ADL score worsened from 2.9 (95% CI 2.4-3.6) at the start of radiation to 3.8 (95% CI 3.1-4.8) at 3 months and then 4.5 (95% CI 3.5-5.7) at month 6. Patients with greater comorbidity (CCI ≥ 4) had worse functional outcomes in months 0-3 compared to patients with less comorbidity (CCI 0-3). MDS-ADL score worsened by 1.9 in the CCI ≥4 patients compared to 0.3 in the CCI 0-3 group During months 3-6, patients in both Charlson groups experienced similar worsening of MDS-ADL score.  Conclusions:   In a vulnerable population of older patients with localized prostate cancer, radiation was associated with a decline in functional independence.

Additional evidence from a real-world setting is required. We present the results of a national study of patients with extracranial oligometastases undergoing SABR, representing the largest dataset, to our knowledge, on outcomes in this population so far.  Methods:   In 2015, National Health Service (NHS) England launched a Commissioning through Evaluation scheme that funded a prospective, registry-based, single-arm, observational, evaluation study of patients with solid cancer and extracranial oligometastases treated with SABR. Prescribed doses ranged from 24-60 Gy administered in three to eight fractions. The study was done at 17 NHS radiotherapy centres in England. Patients were eligible for the scheme if aged 18 years or older with confirmed primary carcinoma (excluding haematological malignancies), one to three extracranial metastatic lesions, a disease-free interval from primary tumour development to metastases of longer than 6 months (with the exception of synchronous colorectal liver metastases), a WHO performance status of 2 or lower, and a life expectancy of at least 6 months. The primary outcome was overall survival at 1 year and 2 years from the start of SABR treatment. The study is now completed.  Findings:   Between June 15, 2015, and Jan 30, 2019, 1422 patients were recruited from 17 hospitals in England. The median age of the patients was 69 years (IQR 62-76), and the most common primary tumour was prostate cancer (406 [28·6%] patients). Median follow-up was 13 months (IQR 6-23). Overall survival was 92·3% (95% CI 90·5-93·9) at 1 year and 79·2% (76·0-82·1) at 2 years. The most common grade 3 adverse event was fatigue (28 [2·0%] of 1422 patients) and the most common serious (grade 4) event was increased liver enzymes (nine [0·6%]). Notreatment-related deaths were reported.  Interpretation:   In patients with extracranial oligometastatic cancer, use of SABR was associated with high overall survival and low toxicity. 'The study findings complement existing evidence from a randomised, phase 2 trial, and represent high-level, real-world evidence supporting the use of SABR in this patient cohort, with a phase 3 randomised, controlled trial to confirm these findings underway.

The literature is aimed to reveal the function and possible molecular mechanisms of miR-596 in prostatic cancer carcinogenesis.  Materials and methods:   qRT-PCR was applied to examine miR-596 expression in prostatic cancer cell lines and samples, also methylation-specific PCR was used to detect the methylation status of the promoter CpG islands in prostatic cancer samples. Meanwhile, the tumor-related effects of miR-596 were detected via cell viability, clone formation assay, migration assay, flow cytometric and AO/EB assay. qRT-PCR and Western blots were applied to investigate the function of miR-596 on malignant behavior in prostatic cancer cells.  Results:   We found that miR-596 mRNA was decreased in prostatic cancer samples and cell lines. miR-596 mRNA level was also correlated to cancer stage, Gleason scores, while miR-596 promoter methylation was related to cancer tumor stage, Gleason score and preoperative PSA levels. miR-596 inhibited the cell growth and activity by causing cell apoptosis, and also suppressed the migration of prostatic cancer cells by revealing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process. In addition, Western blot indicates that miR-596 overexpression deregulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling, by restraining phosphorylation levels of β-catenin and expression levels of downstream targets.

Methods:   Consecutive patients who underwent RP for PCa were retrospectively identified from a tertiary referral hospital. Patients who underwent RP between January 2014 and June 2014 were assigned as derivation cohort (n = 330) and those between January 2018 and February 2018 were assigned as validation cohort (n = 100). MRI-based predictors associated with PSM were assessed: tumor size, tumor-capsule contact length, the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) category, tumor location (tumor contact to the apex or posterolateral side near the neurovascular bundle), apical depth, and prostate volume. A prediction model was developed by using multivariable logistic regression, and then it was transformed into a scoring system. The prediction and calibration performance of this scoring system was evaluated using the C statistics and Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test.  Results:   A total of 121 (36.7%) and 32 (32.0%) of patients in the derivation and validation cohorts had PSMs after RP. The scoring system consisted of the following variables: tumor-capsule contact length, PI-RADS category, tumor located at the apex and/or posterolateral side. This scoring system provided good prediction performance for PSM in the derivation (C statistics, 0.80 [95% CI: 0.76, 0.85]) and validation (C statistics, 0.77 [95% CI: 0.68, 0.87]) cohorts, and also showed good calibration in both cohorts (p = 0.83 and 0.86, respectively).  Conclusions:   An MRI-based scoring system can help estimate the risk of PSM after RP.  Key points:   • An MRI-based scoring system served as a tool to estimate the risk of positive surgical margin (C statistics, 0.80 and 0.77 in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively) after radical prostatectomy. • Tumor with contact to the apex or posterolateral aspect, the tumor contact length to capsule, and higher PI-RADS category were independent predictors for the presence of positive resection margins after radical prostatectomy in men with prostate cancer. • High-risk patients as determined by the scoring system demonstrated adverse post-surgical outcomes compared with low- or intermediate-risk patients, in regard to longer length (mean length, 13.0 mm versus 3.9 mm in low risk or 6.2 mm in intermediate risk; p ≤ 0.001) and higher Gleason grade at the margin (grades 4 and 5 in 69.4% and 20.4% versus 16.7% and 16.7% in low risk or 46.7% and 5.4% in intermediate risk; p < 0.001).""","""['Mi Yeon Park', 'Kye Jin Park', 'Mi-Hyun Kim', 'Jeong Kon Kim']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Pre-biopsy 3-Tesla MRI and targeted biopsy of the index prostate cancer: correlation with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Apparent Diffusion Coefficient and Other Preoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging Features for the Prediction of Positive Surgical Margins in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Long-term oncological outcomes of apical positive surgical margins at radical prostatectomy in the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital cohort.', 'Positive surgical margin during radical prostatectomy: overview of sampling methods for frozen sections and techniques for the secondary resection of the neurovascular bundles.', 'Radical prostatectomy: positive surgical margins matter.', 'Development of a Prediction Model for Positive Surgical Margin in Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Multiparametric MRI-based nomograms in predicting positive surgical margins of prostate cancer after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging can predict prostate cancer with risk for positive surgical margins.']"""

Recently reported triglyseride-glucose (TyG) index is a reliable and accessible indicator of metabolic syndrome. TyG index could be used as a indicator of a prognostic risk factor for metabolic syndrome-related cancers.  Objectives:   To investigate the prognostic role of TyG index on oncological outcomes in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.  Design, setting and participants:   Data from 200 men who underwent radical prostatectomy were used.  Outcome measurements and statsitical analyse:   TyG was calculated based on TyG index = Ln [TG (mg/dL) FPG (mg/dL)/2] formula. Patients were divided into two groups according to the 8.55 level as cut-off value for TyG index. Laboratory results, oncological outcomes and survivals were comparised statistically between groups.  Results:   Mean ages of patients were 64.32 ± 6.1 years and median follow-up time was 61.6 ± 35 (range 4-140) month. Biochemical recurrens was observed in 42 (21%) patients. Positive correlation between TyG index, body mass index, waist circumference, prostate biopsy gleason score, clinical T stage, positive surgical margin, pathological T stage and biochemical recurrence were observed. There was no statistical significance in terms of survival between groups.  Conclusion:   Association between TyG index and prostate cancer may facilitate to predict unfavorable prognostic factors of radical prostatectomy. Increased TyG index may use as a predictive marker of positive surgical margin status before radical prostatectomy, BCR, advanced cT and pT stages after radical prostatectomy or worse biopsy gleason score in clinical practice.""","""['Mustafa Ozan Horsanali', 'Huseyin Eren', 'Eyup Dıl', 'Ilke Onur Kazaz', 'Hakki Uzun']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Clin Pract""","""['Prediction of biochemical recurrence after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: analysis of 784 Japanese patients.', 'Risk factors of positive surgical margin and biochemical recurrence of patients treated with radical prostatectomy: a single-center 10-year report.', 'Prostate-specific antigen level, stage or Gleason score: which is best for predicting outcomes after radical prostatectomy, and does it vary by the outcome being measured?

The potential bioactivity of miR171vr, an isoform of the plant miR171, on human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells was investigated. Bioinformatics simulations revealed that human G protein subunit alpha 12 (GNA12) transcript could represent an excellent target for miR171vr. To confirm this prediction, in vitro experiments were performed using a synthetic microRNA designed on miR171vr sequence. MiR-treated cells showed a significant decrease of GNA12 mRNA and protein levels, confirming the putative cross-kingdom interaction.

Finally, the effect of the plant miRNA on HEK293 cell growth and its stability in presence of several stressors, such as those miming digestive processes and procedures for preparing food, were evaluated. All this preliminary evidence would suggest that miR171vr, introduced by diet or as supplement in gene therapies, could potentially influence human gene expression, especially for treating disorders where GNA12 is over-expressed (i.e. oral cancer, breast and prostate adenocarcinoma) or mTOR kinase is down-regulated (e.g. obesity, type 2 diabetes, neurodegeneration).""","""['Angelo Gismondi', 'Valentina Nanni', 'Valentina Monteleone', 'Claudia Colao', 'Gabriele Di Marco', 'Antonella Canini']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Mol Biol Rep""","""['Comprehensive analysis of microRNA-regulated protein interaction network reveals the tumor suppressive role of microRNA-149 in human hepatocellular carcinoma via targeting AKT-mTOR pathway.', 'MiR-206 inhibits epithelial ovarian cancer cells growth and invasion via blocking c-Met/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.', 'MiRNA-451 Inhibits Glioma Cell Proliferation and Invasion Through the mTOR/HIF-1α/VEGF Signaling Pathway by Targeting CAB39.', 'mTOR in aging, metabolism, and cancer.', 'Tailoring mTOR-based therapy: molecular evidence and clinical challenges.', 'Looking for Plant microRNAs in Human Blood Samples: Bioinformatics Evidence and Perspectives.', 'Improving Whole Tomato Transformation for Prostate Health: Benign Prostate Hypertrophy as an Exploratory Model.', '(-)‑Epigallocatechin‑3‑O‑gallate upregulates the expression levels of miR‑6757‑3p, a suppressor of fibrosis‑related gene expression, in extracellular vesicles derived from human umbilical vein endothelial cells.', 'Inflammatory-miR-301a circuitry drives mTOR and Stat3-dependent PSC activation in chronic pancreatitis and PanIN.', 'Berberine exerts its antineoplastic effects by reversing the Warburg effect via downregulation of the Akt/mTOR/GLUT1 signaling pathway.']"""

In this context, two factors are crucial in determining operating strategy: meningioma-brain interface and meningioma consistency. The use of intraoperative ultrasound (ioUS) elastosonography, a real-time imaging technique, has been introduced in general surgery to evaluate similar features in other pathological settings such as thyroid and prostate cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate ioUS elastosonography in the intraoperative prediction of key intracranial meningioma features and to evaluate its application in guiding surgical strategy.  Methods:   An institutional series of 36 meningiomas studied with ioUS elastosonography is reported. Elastographic data, intraoperative surgical findings, and corresponding preoperative MRI features were classified, applying a score from 0 to 2 to both meningioma consistency and meningioma-brain interface. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the degree of agreement between meningioma elastosonographic features and surgical findings, and whether intraoperative elastosonography was a better predictor than preoperative MRI in assessing meningioma consistency and slip-brain interface, using intraoperative findings as the gold standard.  Results:   A significantly high degree of reliability and agreement between ioUS elastographic scores and surgical finding scores was reported (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.848, F = 12.147, p < 0.001). When analyzing both consistency and brain-tumor interface, ioUS elastography proved to have a rather elevated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and positive (LR+) and negative likelihood ratio (LR-). This consideration was true especially for meningiomas with a hard consistency (sensitivity = 0.92, specificity = 0.96, PPV = 0.92, NPV = 0.96, LR+ = 22.00, LR- = 0.09) and for those presenting with an adherent slip-brain interface (sensitivity = 0.76, specificity = 0.95, PPV = 0.93, NPV = 0.82, LR+ = 14.3, LR- = 0.25). Furthermore, predictions derived from ioUS elastography were found to be more accurate than MRI-derived predictions, as demonstrated by McNemar's test results in both consistency (p < 0.001) and interface (p < 0.001).

However, interpretation of MRI suffers from high inter-observer variability across radiologists, thereby contributing to missed clinically significant cancers, overdiagnosed low-risk cancers, and frequent false positives. Interpretation of MRI could be greatly improved by providing radiologists with an answer key that clearly shows cancer locations on MRI. Registration of histopathology images from patients who had radical prostatectomy to pre-operative MRI allows such mapping of ground truth cancer labels onto MRI. However, traditional MRI-histopathology registration approaches are computationally expensive and require careful choices of the cost function and registration hyperparameters. This paper presents ProsRegNet, a deep learning-based pipeline to accelerate and simplify MRI-histopathology image registration in prostate cancer. Our pipeline consists of image preprocessing, estimation of affine and deformable transformations by deep neural networks, and mapping cancer labels from histopathology images onto MRI using estimated transformations. We trained our neural network using MR and histopathology images of 99 patients from our internal cohort (Cohort 1) and evaluated its performance using 53 patients from three different cohorts (an additional 12 from Cohort 1 and 41 from two public cohorts). Results show that our deep learning pipeline has achieved more accurate registration results and is at least 20 times faster than a state-of-the-art registration algorithm. This important advance will provide radiologists with highly accurate prostate MRI answer keys, thereby facilitating improvements in the detection of prostate cancer on MRI.

However, the cut-off GP4 proportion for AS remains unclear. Here, we evaluated the effect of GP4 proportion and IDC-P on cancer recurrence following radical prostatectomy (RP) in GG1 and GG2 patients, and identified candidates for AS.  Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated 646 patients with PCa who underwent RP between 2005 and 2014, and whose specimens were of GG1 or GG2 status.  Results:   The GGs were as follows: GG1, 25.2% (n = 163); GG2 (5% ≥ GP4), 11.4% (n = 74); GG2 (5% < GP4 ≤ 10%), 25.9% (n = 167); and GG2 (20% ≤ GP4), 37.5% (n = 242). IDC-P was detected in 26 patients (4%), i.e., in 2/167 GG2 (5% < GP4 ≤ 10%; 1%) cases and 24/242 GG2 (20% ≤ GP4; 10%) cases. GG2 patients with IDC-P exhibited a significantly poorer prognosis than did those without IDC-P (P < 0.0001), as did GG2 (20% ≤ GP4) patients without IDC-P (P < 0.05).

Most recurrences following radiotherapy occur within the bladder. Increasing the delivered radiotherapy dose to the tumour may further improve local control. Developments in image-guided radiotherapy have allowed bladder tumour-focused 'plan of the day' radiotherapy delivery. We aim to test within a randomised multicentre phase II trial whether this technique will enable dose escalation with acceptable rates of toxicity.  Methods and analysis:   Patients with T2-T4aN0M0 unifocal MIBC will be randomised (1:1:2) between standard/control whole bladder single plan radiotherapy, standard dose adaptive tumour-focused radiotherapy or dose-escalated adaptive tumour-focused radiotherapy (DART). Adaptive tumour-focused radiotherapy will use a library of three plans (small, medium and large) for treatment. A cone beam CT taken prior to each treatment will be used to visualise the anatomy and inform selection of the most appropriate plan for treatment.Two radiotherapy fractionation schedules (32f and 20f) are permitted. A minimum of 120 participants will be randomised in each fractionation cohort (to ensure 57 evaluable DART patients per cohort).A comprehensive radiotherapy quality assurance programme including pretrial and on-trial components is instituted to ensure standardisation of radiotherapy planning and delivery.The trial has a two-stage non-comparative design. The primary end point of stage I is the proportion of patients meeting predefined normal tissue constraints in the DART group. The primary end point of stage II is late Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3 or worse toxicity aiming to exclude a rate of >20% (80% power and 5% alpha, one sided) in each DART fractionation cohort. Secondary end points include locoregional MIBC control, progression-free survival overall survival and patient-reported outcomes.  Ethics and dissemination:   This clinical trial is approved by the London-Surrey Borders Research Ethics Committee (15/LO/0539).

Commonly described by the linear-quadratic model, fraction size sensitivity of normal tissues is expressed by the α/β ratio. We sought to study individual α/β ratios for different late rectal effects after prostate external beam radiation therapy.  Methods and materials:   The CHHiP trial (ISRCTN97182923) randomized men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer 1:1:1 to 74 Gy/37 fractions (Fr), 60 Gy/20 Fr, or 57 Gy/19 Fr. Patients in the study had full dosimetric data and zero baseline toxicity. Toxicity scales were amalgamated to 6 bowel endpoints: bleeding, diarrhea, pain, proctitis, sphincter control, and stricture. Lyman-Kutcher-Burman models with or without equivalent dose in 2 Gy/Fr correction were log-likelihood fitted by endpoint, estimating α/β ratios. The α/β ratio estimate sensitivity was assessed using sequential inclusion of dose modifying factors (DMFs): age, diabetes, hypertension, inflammatory bowel or diverticular disease (IBD/diverticular), and hemorrhoids. 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were bootstrapped. Likelihood ratio testing of 632 estimator log-likelihoods compared the models.  Results:   Late rectal α/β ratio estimates (without DMF) ranged from bleeding (G1 + α/β = 1.6 Gy; 95% CI, 0.9-2.5 Gy) to sphincter control (G1 + α/β = 3.1 Gy; 95% CI, 1.4-9.1 Gy). Bowel pain modelled poorly (α/β, 3.6 Gy; 95% CI, 0.0-840 Gy). Inclusion of IBD/diverticular disease as a DMF significantly improved fits for stool frequency G2+ (P = .00041) and proctitis G1+ (P = .00046). However, the α/β ratios were similar in these no-DMF versus DMF models for both stool frequency G2+ (α/β 2.7 Gy vs 2.5 Gy) and proctitis G1+ (α/β 2.7 Gy vs 2.6 Gy). Frequency-weighted averaging of endpoint α/β ratios produced: G1 + α/β ratio = 2.4 Gy; G2 + α/β ratio = 2.3 Gy.  Conclusions:   We estimated α/β ratios for several common late adverse effects of rectal radiation therapy.

This study prospectively investigated adherence to the MD with Gleason score progression and explored associations by diabetes status, statin use, and other factors.  Methods:   Men with newly diagnosed PCa on an AS protocol (n = 410) completed a baseline food frequency questionnaire, and the MD score was calculated across 9 energy-adjusted food groups. Cox proportional hazards models were fit to evaluate multivariable-adjusted associations of the MD score with progression-free survival; progression was defined as an increase in the Gleason grade group (GG) score over a biennial monitoring regimen.  Results:   In this cohort, 15% of the men were diabetic, 44% of the men used statins, and 76 men progressed (median follow-up, 36 months). After adjustments for clinical factors, higher adherence to the MD was associated with a lower risk of GG progression among all men (hazard ratio [HR] per 1-unit increase in MD score, 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77-1.01), non-White men (HR per 1-unit increase in MD score, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.45-0.92; P for interaction = .07), and men without diabetes (HR per 1-unit increase in MD score, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.71-0.96; P for interaction = .03). When joint effects of the MD score and statin use were examined, a similar risk reduction was observed among men with high MD scores who did not use statins in comparison with men with low/moderate MD scores with no statin use.  Conclusions:   The MD is associated with a lower risk of GG progression in men on AS, and this is consistent with prior reports about the MD and reduced cancer morbidity and mortality.""","""['Justin R Gregg', 'Xiaotao Zhang', 'Brian F Chapin', 'John F Ward', 'Jeri Kim', 'John W Davis', 'Carrie R Daniel']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Dietary Patterns and Risk of Gleason Grade Progression among Men on Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: Results from the Canary Prostate Active Surveillance Study.', 'Diet quality and Gleason grade progression among localised prostate cancer patients on active surveillance.', 'Coffee, Caffeine Metabolism Genotype and Disease Progression in Patients with Localized Prostate Cancer Managed with Active Surveillance.', 'Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet and Risks of Prostate and Bladder Cancer in the Netherlands Cohort Study.', 'Mediterranean diet and prostate cancer risk and mortality in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study.', 'Dietary Patterns and Risk of Gleason Grade Progression among Men on Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: Results from the Canary Prostate Active Surveillance Study.', 'Narrative review of Mediterranean diet in Cilento: longevity and potential prevention for prostate cancer.', 'Kava root extracts hinder prostate cancer development and tumorigenesis by involvement of dual inhibition of MAO-A and LSD1.', 'Introducing Plant-Based Mediterranean Diet as a Lifestyle Medicine Approach in Latin America: Opportunities Within the Chilean Context.']"""

However, its potential roles and underlined mechanisms in human glioma are still needed to be further clarified. This study was designed to assess the expression of TSG101 in glioma patients and its effects on glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Publicly available data revealed that TSG101 mRNA was significantly upregulated in glioma tissues, and high levels of TSG101 were associated with poor prognosis in glioma patients. Western blot and immunohistochemistry experiments further showed that the expression level of TSG101 protein was significantly upregulated in glioma patients, especially in the patients with high-grade glioma. The functional studies showed that knockdown of TSG101 suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of glioma cells, while overexpression of TSG101 facilitated them. Mechanistic studies indicated that the proliferation, migration, and invasion induced by TSG101 in human glioma were related to AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin and RhoC/Cofilin signaling pathways. In conclusion, the above results suggest that the expression of TSG101 is elevated in glioma patients, which accelerates the proliferation, migration, and invasion of glioma cells by regulating the AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin and RhoC/Cofilin pathways.""","""['Yufu Zhu#', 'Yang Xu#', 'Tianze Chen', 'Yujian Zhang', 'Qiang Ma', 'Sunil Rauniyar', 'Lei Wang', 'Hengliang Shi']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Mol Neurobiol""","""['Cofilin Acts as a Booster for Progression of Malignant Tumors Represented by Glioma.', 'TSG101 promotes the proliferation, migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells by regulating the PEG10.', 'Knockdown of TRIM26 inhibits the proliferation, migration and invasion of bladder cancer cells through the Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin pathway.', 'Nobiletin inhibits invasion via inhibiting AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway in Slug-expressing glioma cells.', 'SALL4 Oncogenic Function in Cancers: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Relevance.', 'Tumor Cell-derived Extracellular Vesicles in Modulating Phenotypes and Immune Functions of Macrophages: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Applications.', 'lncRNA TRHDE-AS1 Correlated with Genomic Landscape and Clinical Outcome in Glioma.', 'LncRNA ZFAS1 contributes to osteosarcoma progression via miR-520b and miR-520e-mediated inhibition of RHOC signaling.', 'Cofilin Acts as a Booster for Progression of Malignant Tumors Represented by Glioma.', 'BAIAP2L1 accelerates breast cancer progression and chemoresistance by activating AKT signaling through binding with ribosomal protein L3.']"""

We aimed to evaluate prevalence of anxiety and depression in prostate cancer survivors post the surgeries, and their correlations with patients' disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).  Methods:   A hundred and ninety-four patients with prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy were enrolled. After discharged from hospital, patients were assessed for post-surgery anxiety and depression every 3 months using Zung Self-rating Anxiety/Depression Scale (SAS/SDS) for a total of 36 months. In addition, disease conditions, DFS, and OS were also documented.  Results:   SAS score (P < 0.001), anxiety rate (P = 0.004), SDS score (P < 0.001), and depression rate (P < 0.001) gradually elevated from baseline to month 36 in prostate cancer patients. Anxiety at baseline (P = 0.009) and anxiety at 3 years (P = 0.017) were correlated with worse DFS, and anxiety at baseline (P = 0.009) was also correlated with shorter OS in prostate cancer patients. Furthermore, depression at baseline (P = 0.005) and depression at 2 years (P = 0.008) were associated with unfavorable DFS, and depression at baseline (P = 0.001), 1 year (P = 0.025), and 2 years (P = 0.008) were associated with worse OS in prostate cancer patients. Moreover, multivariate Cox's proportional hazards regression analysis elucidated that depression at baseline (P = 0.027) was an independent predictive factor for shorter DFS in prostate cancer patients.

Clinicians and researchers are looking for potent treatments for the resistant forms of prostate cancer; however, a handful of small molecules used in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer have not shown potent effects owing to the mutations in the AR (Androgen Receptor). We used SBF-1, a well-characterized antitumor agent with potent cytotoxic effects against different kinds of cancers and investigated its effect on human prostate cancer. SBF-1 substantially inhibited the proliferation, induced apoptosis, and caused cell cycle arrest in LNCaP and PC3/AR+ prostate cancer cell lines. SBF-1 inhibited the activation of the IGF-1-PNCA pathway, as demonstrated by decreased expression of IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and its downstream Bcl-2 protein. Using microscale thermophoresis (MST) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assays, we observed a direct binding of SBF-1 to the AR. SBF-1 binds to the AR-DBD (DNA-binding domain) and blocks the transcription of its target gene. SBF-1 demonstrated a potent antitumor effect in vivo; it inhibited AR signaling and suppressed tumor growth in animals.

Methods:   Men with prostate cancer on ADT were included in this test-retest study. GCT-TT and 30s-CST were performed twice with 1 hour between test sessions. All tests were conducted by two experienced physiotherapists and all patients were familiar with the tests. Only intra-tester reliability was investigated as the test and retest of each participant were performed by the same physiotherapist. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC2.1), standard error of measurement (SEM and SEM95), and smallest real difference (SRD) were calculated.  Results:   Sixty men were included with a mean age of 70.8 ± 6.6 (mean ± SD) years. All performed 30s-CST twice without any problems. Two participants were excluded from the analysis of the GCT-TT results. Relative reliability for 30s-CST (ICC2.1) was 0.97 [95% CI: 0.94-0.98] with low measurement error: SEM95, 1.9 repetitions, and SRD, 2.6 repetitions.

Eastern Cuyahoga County in Ohio is majority AA and is considered an underserved population particularly vulnerable to healthcare disparities. There is a paucity of data about shared decision making among high-risk AA men with regard to prostate cancer screening. This study aims to examine shared versus informed decision making (SDM versus IDM) in a randomized, control trial among a large, high-risk AA population.  Methods:   Patients were included in annual one-day outreach events, each held over 3 years (2017-2019), and were randomized at each event into IDM (control) and SDM (investigational) groups and then were offered screening via prostate specific antigen (PSA) and digital rectal exam (DRE). The primary endpoints were proportion of participants over 40 who did not demonstrate decisional conflict about prostate cancer screening measured by the SURE score, as well as change of knowledge score about prostate cancer screening.  Results:   Overall, 175 patients were enrolled in the trial; 79 in the SDM arm and 96 in the IDM arm. The investigational (SDM) arm had 3/79 (3.9%) conflict versus 6/96 (6.4%) in the control (IDM) arm (p = 0.74). With regard to knowledge improvement, the SDM cohort demonstrated improvement following educational tools for 66/79 (81%) of participants versus 76/96 (79%) in the IDM cohort (p = 0.85). There was no difference in the proportion (63%) of participants in either group who found the information very helpful (using a Likert scale).  Conclusions:   Our education-based study showed no significant difference between SDM and IDM with regard to decisional conflict about prostate cancer screening. The study also demonstrated significant improvement in knowledge about prostate cancer screening in a high-risk AA population in both groups. Our results should be interpreted with caution due to several limitations; however, the study can serve as a benchmark for future studies in this very important topic.""","""['Daniel S Carlson', 'Petros Grivas', 'Wei Wei', 'Puneet K Dhillon', 'Samir Abraksia']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Invest""","""['Fostering shared decision-making about prostate cancer screening among African American men patients and their primary care providers: a randomized behavioral clinical trial.', 'Randomized trial of community health worker-led decision coaching to promote shared decision-making for prostate cancer screening among Black male patients and their providers.', 'Prostate cancer screening and shared decision-making preferences among African-American members of the Prince Hall Masons.', 'Screening for prostate cancer.', 'Social ecological predictors of prostate-specific antigen blood test and digital rectal examination in black American men.', 'Decision coaching for people making healthcare decisions.']"""

Methods:   Patients diagnosed with monofocal HGPIN (mHGPIN), widespread HGPIN (≥4 cores, wHGPIN) and/or ASAP who underwent at least one rebiopsy during their follow-up, were enrolled. All enrollment biopsies underwent central pathologic revision. Risks for PCa were estimated using Fine and Gray method for competing risk.  Results:   Pathologic revision changed the original diagnosis in 32.3% of cases. Among 336 cases enrolled, PCa was diagnosed in 164 (48.8%), and more specifically in 20 (30.3%) mHGPIN, 10 (34.5%) wHGPIN, 101 (54.0%) ASAP, and 33 (61.1%) HGPIN + ASAP (mean follow-up 124 months). Most PCa were Gleason score 6(3 + 3) (51.0%) and 7(3 + 4) (34.3%). On multivariate analysis, HGPIN + ASAP (HR 2.76, p < 0.001) and ASAP alone (HR 2.41, p < 0.001) were the only lesions significantly associated with PCa development. Of all cancers detected, 64.3% were at first rebiopsy. A rebiopsy performed within 3 months after ASAP diagnosis had a 45% chance of finding PCa. At Kaplan-Meier survival curves, median PCa-free survival was 48.1 months for HGPIN + ASAP and 64.9 months for ASAP (p 0.0005 at Log-rank test). At 1 year, 70% of HGPIN + ASAP, 73% of ASAP, 89% of wHGPIN, and 84% of mHGPIN were PCa-free.  Conclusion:   The diagnosis of ASAP and HGPIN strongly relies on the expertise of dedicated uro-pathologists.

Cancer growth was quantified by a luciferase-based in vivo imaging system (IVIS) serially every 7 days. Comparisons were made for urodynamic parameters, bladder histology, and biological markers until the sixth week. Bladder wall structural changes were assessed by the bladder wall thickness and degree of fibrosis. Biomarker expressions in bladder tissue including muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 2 (M2 ), transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 4 (TRPV4), BCL2-associated X protein (Bax), and caspase3 were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining and immunofluorescence confocal laser scanning microscopy.  Results:   DU145 cell growth in the prostate was successfully monitored by a luciferase-based IVIS. after orthotopic injection. Using our injection technique, no anatomical obstruction of the bladder outlet and urethra was noted up to 6 weeks after injection. The presence of PCa induced changes in urinary bladder histology, biomarkers, and urodynamic parameters. Cystometry showed features of detrusor overactivity with increased voiding frequency and high-amplitude voiding contractions from the fourth week onward. Histological analyses 4 weeks after DU145 injection demonstrated detrusor thickening and bladder wall fibrosis. Immunohistochemistry showed increased expressions of bladder M2 , TRPV4, Bax, and caspase3 in the PCa mice as early as in the first or second week.

Overall survival (OS) was calculated and documented. In prostate cancer survivors post-resection, the SAS score, anxiety occurrence rate, SDS score and depression occurrence rate all gradually elevated from baseline to month 36. Multivariate logistic regression analysis disclosed that age ≥ 65 years, education duration<9 years, marry status of single/divorced/widowed, unemployment before surgery, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, higher Gleason score, higher pathological T stage, higher pathological N stage, positive surgical margin status were independent factors related to higher anxiety risk in the 3 years follow-up duration. Additionally, unemployment before surgery, hyperlipidemia, higher pathological T stage, higher pathological N stage, positive surgical margin status were independently associated with depression risk in the 3 years follow-up duration. In addition, baseline anxiety, baseline depression, 1-year depression and 2-year depression associated with worse OS.

However, the repeatability and reproducibility (R&R) limits above which a true change in ADC can be considered relevant are poorly defined. This study assessed these limits in a standardized whole-body (WB)-MRI protocol.  Methods:   A prospective, multicenter study was performed at three centers equipped with the same 3.0-T scanners to test a WB-MRI protocol including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Eight healthy volunteers per center were enrolled to undergo test and retest examinations in the same center and a third examination in another center. ADC variability was assessed in multiple organs by two readers using two-way mixed ANOVA, Bland-Altman plots, coefficient of variation (CoV), and the upper limit of the 95% CI on repeatability (RC) and reproducibility (RDC) coefficients.  Results:   CoV of ADC was not influenced by other factors (center, reader) than the organ. Based on the upper limit of the 95% CI on RC and RDC (from both readers), a change in ADC in an individual patient must be superior to 12% (cerebrum white matter), 16% (paraspinal muscle), 22% (renal cortex), 26% (central and peripheral zones of the prostate), 29% (renal medulla), 35% (liver), 45% (spleen), 50% (posterior iliac crest), 66% (L5 vertebra), 68% (femur), and 94% (acetabulum) to be significant.

Tumour-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) are potent mediators of PMN formation due to their diverse complement of pro-malignant molecular cargo and their propensity to target specific cell types (Costa-Silva et al., 2015; Hoshino et al., 2015; Peinado et al., 2012; Peinado et al., 2017). While significant progress has been made to understand the mechanisms by which pro-metastatic EVs create tumour-favouring microenvironments at pre-metastatic organ sites, comparatively little attention has been paid to the factors intrinsic to recipient cells that may modify the extent to which pro-metastatic EV signalling is received and transduced. Here, we investigated the role of recipient cell cholesterol homeostasis in prostate cancer (PCa) EV-mediated signalling and metastasis. Using a bone metastatic model of enzalutamide-resistant PCa, we first characterized an axis of EV-mediated communication between PCa cells and bone marrow that is marked by in vitro and in vivo PCa EV uptake by bone marrow myeloid cells, activation of NF-κB signalling, enhanced osteoclast differentiation, and reduced myeloid thrombospondin-1 expression. We then employed a targeted, biomimetic approach to reduce myeloid cell cholesterol in vitro and in vivo prior to conditioning with PCa EVs. Reducing myeloid cell cholesterol prevented the uptake of PCa EVs by recipient myeloid cells, abolished NF-κB activity and osteoclast differentiation, stabilized thrombospondin-1 expression, and reduced metastatic burden by 77%. These results demonstrate that cholesterol homeostasis in bone marrow myeloid cells regulates pro-metastatic EV signalling and metastasis by acting as a gatekeeper for EV signal transduction.""","""['Stephen E Henrich', 'Kaylin M McMahon', 'Michael P Plebanek', 'Andrea E Calvert', 'Timothy J Feliciano', 'Samuel Parrish', 'Fabio Tavora', 'Anthony Mega', 'Andre De Souza', 'Benedito A Carneiro', 'C Shad Thaxton']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Extracell Vesicles""","""['Small extracellular vesicles deliver osteolytic effectors and mediate cancer-induced osteolysis in bone metastatic niche.', 'Communication of prostate cancer cells with bone cells via extracellular vesicle RNA; a potential mechanism of metastasis.', 'Tumor-derived miR-378a-3p-containing extracellular vesicles promote osteolysis by activating the Dyrk1a/Nfatc1/Angptl2 axis for bone metastasis.', 'Exosomal miRNAs from Prostate Cancer Impair Osteoblast Function in Mice.', 'Role of Exosomes in Prostate Cancer Metastasis.', 'Lipid metabolism and tumor immunotherapy.', 'New insights into lipid metabolism and prostate cancer (Review).', 'The capture of extracellular vesicles endogenously released by xenotransplanted tumours induces an inflammatory reaction in the premetastatic niche.', 'A Novel Four Mitochondrial Respiration-Related Signature for Predicting Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer.', 'Extracellular Vesicles in Multiple Myeloma-Cracking the Code to a Better Understanding of the Disease.']"""

However, it has remained unclear whether antisense eRNAs in different direction are functional or merely a reflection of enhancer activation. Methods: Strand-specific, ribosome-minus RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) were performed in AR positive prostate cancer cells. RNA-seq, GRO-seq, ChIP-seq, 4C-seq and DNA-methylation-seq that published in our and other labs were re-analyzed to define bi-directional enhancer RNA and DNA methylation regions. Molecular mechanisms were demonstrated by 3C, ChIP, ChIRP, CLIP, RT-PCR and western blot assays. The biological functions of antisense-eRNA were assessed using mice xenograft model and RT-PCR analysis in human tissues. Results: In this study, we identified that antisense eRNA was regulated by androgen receptor (AR) activity in prostate cancer cells. Antisense eRNA negatively regulated antisense ncRNA in AR-related target genes' loci, through recruiting DNMT1 on the antisense enhancer in the gene-ending regions and elevating DNA methylation. Importantly, the chromatin exhibited a double looping manner that facilitated sense-eRNA to promoter and antisense-eRNA to gene-ending region in cis. Depletion of antisense eRNA impaired its neighbor mRNA expression, cancer growth and invasion. The expressions of antisense eRNA were correlated with biochemical recurrence and clinical marker PSA's levels in patients' tissues. Conclusions: The findings indicated that antisense eRNA was a functional RNA and may be a novel target that when suppressed improved prostate cancer therapy and diagnosis. New chromatin interaction among enhancer, promoter and gene-ending region might provide new insight into the spatiotemporal mechanism of the gene transcription and acting of bi-directional eRNAs.""","""['Chun-Wu Pan', 'Simeng Wen', 'Lei Chen', 'Yulei Wei', 'Yuanjie Niu', 'Yu Zhao']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 functions as an epigenetic activator of the androgen receptor to promote prostate cancer cell growth.', 'HPSE enhancer RNA promotes cancer progression through driving chromatin looping and regulating hnRNPU/p300/EGR1/HPSE axis.', 'Enhancer RNAs participate in androgen receptor-driven looping that selectively enhances gene activation.', 'Androgen receptor enhancer usage and the chromatin regulatory landscape in human prostate cancers.', 'Enhancer RNA: biogenesis, function, and regulation.', 'Identification of the enhancer RNAs related to tumorgenesis of pituitary neuroendocrine tumors.', 'JUN-induced super-enhancer RNA forms R-loop to promote nasopharyngeal carcinoma metastasis.', 'Enhancer RNA promotes resistance to radiotherapy in bone-metastatic prostate cancer by m6A modification.', 'Emerging Role of Enhancer RNAs as Potential Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarkers in Cancer.', 'Enhancer RNAs step forward: new insights into enhancer function.']"""

Methods:   Nine hundred and five consecutive men with elevated PSA were prospectively recruited from two hospitals. Core analyses focused on consecutive men with PSA 4-20 ng/mL (n = 600). Pre-biopsy urine without prior prostatic massage was analyzed for spermine level with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS/MS). The proportions of PCa and HGPCa were compared across different spermine ranges. Logistic regressions were used to form different models, and their performances were compared using area under curve (AUC) and decision curve analysis (DCA).  Results:   PCa and HGPCa were diagnosed in 30.8% (185/600) and 17.2% (103/600) men, respectively, and were significantly associated with lower urine spermine levels. Between the lowest and highest quartiles of spermine results, a threefold increase in PCa risk (49.3% vs. 16.7%) and 3.5-fold increase in ISUP grade group ≥2 PCa risk (31.3% vs. 8.7%) were observed. Multivariate analysis showed PSA, prostate volume (PV), digital rectal examination (DRE), and spermine, which were independent predictors for PCa and HGPCa, and a Spermine Risk Score with these factors achieved the highest AUC of 0.78 for PCa and 0.82 for HGPCa.

Objective:   To investigate whether plasma Vit D and selenium levels prior to radical prostatectomy (RP) are associated with worse pathologic tumor characteristics and increased risk of disease recurrence.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 3849 men with PCa scheduled for RP in the Martini-Klinik at the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany, between January 2014 and December 2018 were included in this study.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Age, and clinical and laboratory values were collected prior to RP. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) was defined as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≥0.2 μg/l and rising after RP. Kaplan-Meier plots depicted BCR-free survival. Cox regression models (adjusted for age, preoperative PSA, pT stage, pN stage, pGG, surgical margin status, and year of surgery) tested the relationship between oncologic outcomes and Vit D and selenium levels.  Results and limitations:   Median plasma Vit D and selenium levels were 19.3 and 71 μg/l, respectively. Circulating Vit D and selenium levels correlated inversely with PSA values. Histologic grade, pT stage, and pN stage were not associated with Vit D and selenium levels at the time of RP. In the overall cohort, BCR-free survival at 3 yr of follow-up was 82.9%. When stratified according to median Vit D levels, BCR-free survival at 3 yr of follow-up was 82.7% and 83.0% (p ≤ 0.59). Upon stratification according to median selenium levels, BCR-free survival was 82.2% and 83.7% (p = 0.19). In a multivariable Cox regression model predicting BCR, lower Vit D and selenium levels were not independent predictors of BCR.  Conclusions:   Plasma Vit D and selenium levels prior to RP were not associated with BCR-free survival.  Patient summary:   The results of the MARTINI-Lifestyle cohort could not show a correlation between the occurrence of biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy and the serum levels of vitamin D and selenium. A recommendation should therefore be made to compensate for a potential deficiency and not with the expectation of a reduction in the risk of progression.""","""['Imke Thederan', 'Thenappan Chandrasekar', 'Pierre Tennstedt', 'Sophie Knipper', 'Laura Kuehl', 'Derya Tilki', 'Matthias Augustin', 'Hans Heinzer', 'Birgit-Christiane Zyriax']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Long-term cancer control outcomes in patients with clinically high-risk prostate cancer treated with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: results from a multi-institutional study of 1100 patients.', 'Assessing the Optimal Timing for Early Salvage Radiation Therapy in Patients with Prostate-specific Antigen Rise After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Prediction of outcome following early salvage radiotherapy among patients with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Long-term data on the survival of patients with prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy in the prostate-specific antigen era.', 'High-Dose Vitamin C for Cancer Therapy.', 'Association of Plasma Selenium and Its Untargeted Metabolomic Profiling with Cervical Cancer Prognosis.', 'How competing risks affect the epidemiological relationship between vitamin D and prostate cancer incidence?

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the likelihood of detecting locally recurrent prostate cancer utilizing mpMRI in patients with suspected recurrence following radical prostatectomy (RP) parsed by PSA and Gleason grade.  Methods:   One hundred ninety five patients with suspected local recurrence were imaged on a 1.5 T MRI with torso array and endorectal coil in this retrospective study. mpMRI interpretations were stratified by PSA and lower (Gleason < 7) vs. higher grade tumors (Gleason 8-10). Recursive partitioning was used to determine whether mpMRI interpretations could be classified as positive or negative.  Results:   The majority of mpMRI interpretations in patients with lower Gleason grade tumors and PSA < 0.5 ng/mL were negative (68/78, 87.2%, p = 0.004). The majority of mpMRI interpretations in patients with higher Gleason grade tumors and PSA > 1.5 ng/mL were positive (8/9, 88.9%, p = 0.003). Findings were corroborated by recursive partitioning, which identified a PSA = 0.5 ng/ml in patients with lower grade tumors and a PSA = 1.5 ng/mL in patients with higher grade tumors as differentiating negative and positive mpMRIs.  Conclusion:   In the setting of suspected recurrence after RP, mpMRI results are associated with PSA and Gleason grade, both of which can help guide when mpMRI may find utility. mpMRI is likely to be low diagnostic yield and negative for recurrence (87%) in the setting of lower Gleason grade tumors and PSA < 0.5 ng/mL. mpMRI is likely to be of low diagnostic value and positive for recurrence (89%) in the setting of PSA > 1.5 ng/mL and higher grade tumors; in this case, mpMRI findings may be more useful for directing biopsy and local therapy. Between these extremes, PSA > 0.5 ng/mL and lower grade tumors or PSA < 1.5 ng/mL and higher grade tumors, mpMRI results are less predictable, suggesting greater diagnostic value for detecting recurrence post prostatectomy.""","""['Aradhana M Venkatesan', 'Eniola Mudairu-Dawodu', 'Cihan Duran', 'R Jason Stafford', 'Yuanqing Yan', 'Wei Wei', 'Vikas Kundra']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Imaging""","""['Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Is an Independent Predictor of Salvage Radiotherapy Outcomes After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Prognostic Implications of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Concomitant Systematic Biopsy in Predicting Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy in Prostate Cancer Patients Diagnosed with Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Biopsy.', 'Evaluation of tumor recurrences after radical prostatectomy using 18F-Choline PET/CT and 3T multiparametric MRI without endorectal coil: a single center experience.', 'The cribriform morphology impairs Gleason 7 prostate cancer lesion detection on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

The aim of the study was to analyze the impact of acidic pHe on gene expression on mRNA and protein level in two experimental tumor lines in vitro and in vivo and were compared to hypoxic conditions as well as combined acidosis+hypoxia.  Methods:   Gene expression was analyzed in AT1 prostate and Walker-256 mammary carcinoma of the rat by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), qPCR and Western blot. In addition, the impact of acidosis on tumor cell migration, adhesion, proliferation, cell death and mitochondrial activity was analyzed.  Results:   NGS analyses revealed that 147 genes were uniformly regulated in both cell lines (in vitro) and 79 genes in both experimental tumors after 24 h at low pH. A subset of 25 genes was re-evaluated by qPCR and Western blot. Low pH consistently upregulated Aox1, Gls2, Gstp1, Ikbke, Per3, Pink1, Tlr5, Txnip, Ypel3 or downregulated Acat2, Brip1, Clspn, Dnajc25, Ercc6l, Mmd, Rif1, Zmpste24 whereas hypoxia alone led to a downregulation of most of the genes. Direct incubation at low pH reduced tumor cell adhesion whereas acidic pre-incubation increased the adhesive potential. In both tumor lines acidosis induced a G1-arrest (in vivo) of the cell cycle and a strong increase in necrotic cell death (but not in apoptosis). The mitochondrial O2 consumption increased gradually with decreasing pH.

This study aims to clarify the inhibitory role of human PGM5 antisense RNA 1 (PGM5-AS1) in the proliferation and apoptosis of PCa cells.  Methods:   The regulatory network of PGM5-AS1/microRNA-587 (miR-587)/growth and differentiation factor 10 (GDF10) axis was examined by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay, RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation, and RNA pull down assay. We manipulated the expression of PGM5-AS1, miR-587 and GDF10 by transducing expression vectors, mimic, inhibitor, or short hairpin RNA into PCa cells, thus establishing their functions in cell proliferation and apoptosis. Additionally, we measured the tumorigenicity of PCa cells xenografted in nude mice.  Results:   PGM5-AS1 is expressed at low levels in PCa cell lines. Forced overexpression of PGM5-AS1 restricted proliferation and facilitated apoptosis of PCa cells, manifesting in suppressed xenograft tumor growth in nude mice. Notably, PGM5-AS1 competitively bound to miR-587, which directly targets GDF10. We further validated that the anti-cancer role of PGM5-AS1 in PCa cells was achieved by binding to miR-587 to promote the expression of GDF10.

In clinical prostate cancer samples, miR-194 expression and activity were elevated in NEPC and inversely correlated with AR signaling. miR-194 facilitated the emergence of neuroendocrine features in prostate cancer cells, a process mediated by its ability to directly target a suite of genes involved in cell plasticity. One such target was FOXA1, which encodes a transcription factor with a vital role in maintaining the prostate epithelial lineage. Importantly, a miR-194 inhibitor blocked epithelial-neuroendocrine transdifferentiation and inhibited the growth of cell lines and patient-derived organoids possessing neuroendocrine features.

Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to analyze associations with PCa for: individual metabolic components (TG, HDL, HbA1c, BP, WC), combinations of two and three components, and MetS overall (three or more components). We conducted mediation analyses to examine potential hormonal and inflammatory pathways (total testosterone [TT], C-reactive protein [CRP], insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1]) through which MetS components may influence PCa risk. A total of 5409 men in the study developed PCa during a median follow-up of 6.9 years. We found no significant association between MetS and PCa risk (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.92-1.06). No associations were found with PCa risk and individual measurements of TG, HDL, BP, or WC. However, an inverse association was observed with elevated HbA1c (≥42 mmol/mol) (HR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.79-0.98). Consistent inverse associations were observed between HbA1c and risk of PCa. Mediation analysis revealed TT, CRP, and IGF-1 as potential mediating factors for this association contributing 10.2%, 7.1%, and 7.9% to the total effect, respectively. Overall MetS had no association with PCa risk. However, a consistent inverse association with PCa risk was found for HbA1c.

When this prior information consists of estimates from association analyses of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)-intermediate or SNP-gene expression, a hierarchical model is equivalent to a 2-stage instrumental or transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) analysis, respectively. We propose to extend our previous approach for the joint analysis of marginal summary statistics to incorporate prior information via a hierarchical model (hJAM). In this framework, the use of appropriate estimates as prior information yields an analysis similar to Mendelian randomization (MR) and TWAS approaches. hJAM is applicable to multiple correlated SNPs and intermediates to yield conditional estimates for the intermediates on the outcome, thus providing advantages over alternative approaches. We investigated the performance of hJAM in comparison with existing MR and TWAS approaches and demonstrated that hJAM yields an unbiased estimate, maintains correct type-I error, and has increased power across extensive simulations. We applied hJAM to 2 examples: estimating the causal effects of body mass index (GIANT Consortium) and type 2 diabetes (DIAGRAM data set, GERA Cohort, and UK Biobank) on myocardial infarction (UK Biobank) and estimating the causal effects of the expressions of the genes for nuclear casein kinase and cyclin dependent kinase substrate 1 and peptidase M20 domain containing 1 on the risk of prostate cancer (PRACTICAL and GTEx).""","""['Lai Jiang', 'Shujing Xu', 'Nicholas Mancuso', 'Paul J Newcombe', 'David V Conti']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Am J Epidemiol""","""['Model checking via testing for direct effects in Mendelian Randomization and transcriptome-wide association studies.', 'Multi-trait transcriptome-wide association studies with probabilistic Mendelian randomization.', 'Phenome-wide Mendelian-randomization study of genetically determined vitamin D on multiple health outcomes using the UK Biobank study.', 'Meta-analysis and Mendelian randomization: A review.', 'Strategies to investigate and mitigate collider bias in genetic and Mendelian randomisation studies of disease progression.', 'Mendelian randomization.', 'Statistical methods for cis-Mendelian randomization with two-sample summary-level data.']"""

The lipid-bearing PEGylated dendrimer was successfully synthesized through in situ two-step reaction. It was able to spontaneously self-assemble into stable, cationic, nanosized vesicles, with low critical aggregation concentration value, and also showed redox-responsiveness in presence of a glutathione concentration similar to that of the cytosolic reducing environment. In addition, it was able to condense more than 70% of DNA at dendrimer: DNA weight ratios of 5 : 1 and higher. This dendriplex resulted in an enhanced cellular uptake of DNA at dendrimer: DNA weight ratios of 10 : 1 and 20 : 1, by up to 16-fold and by up to 28-fold compared with naked DNA in PC-3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines respectively. At a dendrimer: DNA weight ratio of 20 : 1, it led to an increase in gene expression in PC-3 and DU145 cells, compared with DAB dendriplex.

Age-specific incidence rates (ASIRs) vary by up to 189-fold globally, with an ASIR of 68.0 per 100 000 in 2018 in SA.  Objectives:   To describe PCa among men undergoing prostate biopsy in Gauteng Province, SA.  Methods:   We undertook a retrospective descriptive study using prostate biopsy data collected from the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) database between 2006 and 2016. We extracted the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) clinical terms morphology and topography codes to assign histological findings using the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology. PCa was defined as adenocarcinoma with a reported Gleason Score (GS). The new grade group (GG) based on the GS is defined as follows; (i) GG1 for a GS ≤6; (ii) GG2 for a GS of 3 + 4 = 7 ; (iii) GG3 for a GS of 4 + 3 = 7; (iv) GG4 for a GS of 8; and (v) GG5 for a GS ≥9. Higher-grade disease was defined as GG4 and GG5 (GS ≥8), in line with local guidelines. We reported associations of PCa with a GS ≥7 with age and race and used provincial and world standard population data to determine annual ASIRs.  Results:   We identified 22 937 biopsies referred to the NHLS between 2006 and 2016. Of the 6 448 biopsies (39%) with a PCa finding for black Africans, 46% were diagnosed with high-risk PCa compared with 36 - 40% for other race groups (p&lt;0.0001). Black Africans were more likely than whites to have GG4 or GG5 PCa (odds ratio 1.45; 95% confidence interval 1.27 - 1.67). The ASIR increased from 44.9 per 100 000 in 2006 to 57.3 per 100 000 in 2016.  Conclusions:   Black African men were significantly more likely to present with PCa with a GS ≥8 (GG4 and GG5) compared with the other racial groups in Gauteng. The ASIR increased dramatically during the study period, perhaps as a result of increased screening and awareness.

Stereotactic body radiotherapy as a less invasive method has similar dosimetric results with HDR brachytherapy. This study aims to evaluate the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, acute side effects, and quality of life of patients who underwent stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) as a boost after pelvic radiotherapy (RT).  Methods:   A total of 34 patients diagnosed with high-risk prostate cancer treated with SBRT boost (21 Gy in three fractions) combined with whole pelvic RT (50 Gy in 25 fractions) were evaluated. Biochemical control has been evaluated with PSA before, and after treatment, acute adverse events were evaluated with radiation therapy oncology group (RTOG) grading scale and quality of life with the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) scoring system.  Results:   The mean follow-up of 34 patients was 41.2 months (range 7-52). The mean initial PSA level was 22.4 ng/mL. None of the patients had experienced a biochemical or clinical relapse of the disease. Grade 2 and higher acute gastrointestinal (GI) was observed in 14%, and genitourinary (GU) toxicity was observed in 29%. None of the patients had grade 3-4 late toxicity.

In recent years, the use of docetaxel, abiraterone, enzalutamide, and apalutamide has been used for mHSPC, but combined androgen blockade (CAB) therapy using first-generation antiandrogens has been widely used in Japan. There is a background. We performed a consecutive study of patients who received combined androgen blockade (CAB) at a single institute to determine the prognostic factors for mHSPC.  Patients and methods:   We conducted a consecutive study of 237 mHSPC patients treated with CAB from 2003 to 2017 at the Gunma University Hospital. Prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival (PSA-PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The associations between pre-treatment risk factors and the PSA response 3 months after starting CAB, PSA-PFS, and OS were evaluated by the Cox proportional hazards model.  Results:   Among the 237 cases, the median PSA-PFS and OS times were 63.0 and 91.4 months, respectively. The median PSA-PFS and OS times of M1 cases (174 cases, 73.4% of all 237 cases) were 36.1 and 75.9 months, respectively. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) score, hemoglobin (Hb), lactate dehydrogenase, extent of disease, visceral metastasis (no vs. yes), and PSA response after 3 months were significant predictors of OS according to Cox regression analysis of prognostic factors in M1 patients. The ECOG PS, Hb, visceral metastasis (no vs. yes), and PSA response after 3 months predicted OS high-risk patients in LATITUDE criteria. The OS was 92.1 months in the low-risk group (0-1 risk factors), 48.2 months in the intermediate-risk group (2 risk factors), and 16.9 months in the high-risk group (3-4 risk factors).

Methods:   The study is based on health insurance claims data of the Helsana Group. The Helsana Group is one of the largest health insurers in Switzerland, insuring approximately 15% of the entire Swiss population across all regions and age groups. We assessed proportions of the eligible populations receiving colonoscopy/fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), mammography, or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing in the years 2014, 2016, and 2018, and calculated average marginal effects of individual, temporal, regional, insurance-, supply-, and system-related variables on testing utilization using logistic regression.  Results:   Overall, 8.3% of the eligible population received colonoscopy/FOBT in 2014, 8.9% in 2016, and 9.2% in 2018. In these years, 20.9, 21.2, and 20.4% of the eligible female population received mammography, and 30.5, 31.1, and 31.8% of the eligible male population had PSA testing. Adjusted testing utilization varied little between 2014 and 2018; there was an increasing trend of 0.8% (0.6-1.0%) for colonoscopy/FOBT and of 0.5% (0.2-0.8%) for PSA testing, while mammography use decreased by 1.5% (1.2-1.7%). Generally, testing utilization was higher in French-speaking and Italian-speaking compared to German-speaking region for all screening types. Cantonal programs for breast cancer screening were associated with an increase of 7.1% in mammography utilization. In contrast, a high density of relevant specialist physicians showed null or even negative associations with screening utilization.  Conclusions:   Variation in cancer screening utilization was modest over time, but considerable between regions. Regional variation was highest for mammography use where recommendations are debated most controversially, and the implementation of programs differed the most.""","""['Caroline Bähler', 'Beat Brüngger', 'Agne Ulyte', 'Matthias Schwenkglenks', 'Viktor von Wyl', 'Holger Dressel', 'Oliver Gruebner', 'Wenjia Wei', 'Eva Blozik']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BMC Public Health""","""['Ten-year changes in colorectal cancer screening in Switzerland: The Swiss Health Interview Survey 2007, 2012 and 2017.', 'Variation of colorectal, breast and prostate cancer screening activity in Switzerland: Influence of insurance, policy and guidelines.', 'Accuracy of self-reported cancer-screening histories: a meta-analysis.', 'Implications of false-positive results for future cancer screenings.', 'Examples of screening investigations.', 'Ten-year changes in colorectal cancer screening in Switzerland: The Swiss Health Interview Survey 2007, 2012 and 2017.']"""

Several autophagy-related genes (ARGs) contribute to the process of tumorigenesis and metastasis of prostate cancer (PCa). Also, miRNAs have been proven to modulate autophagy by targeting some ARGs. However, their potential role in PCa still remains unclear.  Methods:   An univariate Cox proportional regression model was used to identify 17 ARGs associated with the overall survival (OS) of PCa. Then, a multivariate Cox proportional regression model was used to construct a 6 autophagy-related prognostic genes signature. Patients were divided into low-risk group and high-risk group using the median risk score as a cutoff value. High-risk patients had shorter OS than low-risk patients. Furthermore, the signature was validated by ROC curves. Regarding mRNA and miRNA, 12 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) and 1073 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected via the GEO database. We found that miR-205, one of the DEMs, was negatively regulated the expression of ARG (NKX2-3). Based on STRING analysis results, we found that the NKX2-3 was moderately related to the part of genes among the 6 autophagy-related genes prognostic signature. Further, NKX 2-3 was significantly correlated with OS and some clinical parameters of PCa by cBioProtal. By gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Lastly, we demonstrated that the association between NKX2-3 and tumor mutation burden (TMB) and PDCD1 (programmed cell death 1) of PCa.  Results:   We identified that the six ARGs expression patterns are independent predictors of OS in PCa patients. Furthermore, our results suggest that ARGs and miRNAs are inter-related. MiR-205 was negatively regulated the expression of ARG (NKX2-3). Further analysis demonstrated that NKX2-3 may be a potential biomarker for predicting the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in PCa.  Conclusions:   The current study may offer a novel autophagy-related prognostic signature and may identify a promising miRNA-ARG pathway for predicting the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in PCa.""","""['Lei Wu', 'Wen Quan', 'Guojun Yue', 'Qiong Luo', 'Dongxu Peng', 'Ying Pan', 'Guihai Zhang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Expression status and prognostic value of autophagy-related lncRNAs in prostate cancer.', 'Development of an autophagy-related gene expression signature for prognosis prediction in prostate cancer patients.', 'Identification of Potential miRNAs Biomarkers for High-Grade Prostate Cancer by Integrated Bioinformatics Analysis.', 'miRNAs as biomarkers in prostate cancer.', 'miRNAs and radiotherapy response in prostate cancer.', 'An autophagy-related gene prognostic index predicting biochemical recurrence, metastasis, and drug resistance for prostate cancer.', 'Plasticity of cancer invasion and energy metabolism.', 'microRNA-205 in prostate cancer: Overview to clinical translation.', 'Targeting autophagy in prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic response.']"""

However, few studies investigated roles of genetic variants of GnRH pathway genes in survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Therefore, we first evaluated associations between 22,528 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 101 GnRH pathway genes and survival of 1185 NSCLC patients using a dataset from Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. We found 572 SNPs to be significantly associated with overall survival (OS) of NSCLC (P ≤ 0.05, Bayesian false discovery probability ≤0.80). We then validated these SNPs in another dataset with 984 NSCLC patients from the Harvard Lung Cancer Susceptibility Study. Finally, two independent SNPs (HBEGF rs4150236G>A and ITPR3 rs116454384C>T) remained significantly associated with NSCLC OS in the combined analysis with hazards ratios of 0.84 (95% confidence interval = 0.76-0.92, P = 0.0003) and 0.85 (0.78-0.94, 0.0012), respectively; their genetic score (the number of protective genotypes) was associated with a better OS and disease-specific survival (Ptrend = 0.0002 and 0.0001, respectively). Further expression quantitative trail loci analysis showed a significant correlation between ITPR3 rs116454384 T allele and an increased mRNA expression level in both whole blood and normal lung tissue, and high ITPR3 mRNA expression levels in tumors were associated with a better survival of NSCLC patients.

Methods:   Cancer survivors who (1) were aged 50 or older, (2) had been diagnosed with breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer, and (3) received their diagnosis within 10 years of the study start date were recruited at four Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry program sites.

All sites collected data through a survey or questionnaire(s); each site employed unique methods to administer their surveys.  Results:   Across the sites, initial recruitment appeared to be the most challenging aspect in establishing a longitudinal cohort from the SEER sampling frame, with participation rates ranging from 3 to 17%. However, once enrolled, the percentage of survivors completing surveys at multiple time points was relatively high, ranging from 48 to 91%.  Conclusion:   Augmenting cancer registry data with longitudinally collected PGHD is feasible, although more work is needed to overcome barriers of initial patient recruitment and adoption of online PGHD collection techniques for public health surveillance.

Nevertheless, the reliability of the SUV of bone SPECT has not been well established. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the test-retest repeatability of the SUV of bone SPECT/CT in clinical settings.  Methods:   This prospective study recruited patients with prostate cancer planning to receive bone SPECT/CT for the evaluation of bone abnormality between August 2017 and September 2019. Bone images were acquired twice by an integrated SPECT/CT scanner (Symbia Intevo, Siemens) within a 4- to 10-day interval. The maximum SUV (SUVmax) and peak SUV (SUVpeak) were calculated for the volumes of interests on the normal bone areas, degeneration/fracture lesions, and metastatic lesions. To determine repeatability, we calculated statistical indicators, including intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), repeatability coefficient (RC), and mean absolute percentage difference (MAPD). For the ICC, the 95% confidential interval (CI) was also calculated, and an ICC of ≥ 0.8 was defined as an almost perfect correlation.  Results:   Twelve male patients were enrolled in the study (58-86 years; median, 71 years), and a total of 229 volumes of the interest were included in the analyses.

The RCs of the relative difference were 30.7% for SUVmax and 27.6% for SUVpeak, and the MAPDs (± standardized deviation) of all lesions were 12.3 ± 9.9% for SUVmax and 11.5 ± 8.3% for SUVpeak. The RCs and the MAPDs showed comparable value with the previous report regarding repeatability studies on PET.  Conclusion:   An almost perfect correlation was demonstrated by repeated SUVmax and SUVpeak measured by quantitative integrated SPECT/CT.

Particular reference is given to low PSA groups < 0.5 ng/mL to aid discussion around the inclusion of this group in PSMA guidelines and funding pathways.  Methods:   Retrospective analysis of combined PSMA database patients from centers in Australia and New Zealand. Two hundred twenty-two patients presenting with recurrence post RP were stratified into five PSA groups (ng/mL): 0-0.19, 0.2-0.49, 0.5-0.99, 1-1.99, and ≥ 2. Lesions detected by [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT were recorded as local recurrence, locoregional nodes, and metastases.  Results:   Of 222 patients, 155 (69.8%) had evidence of abnormal uptake suggestive of recurrent prostate cancer. The detection efficacies for [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT were 91.7% (44/48) for PSA levels ≥ 2 ng/mL, 82.1% (23/28) for PSA levels 1-1.99 ng/mL, 62.8% (27/43) for PSA levels 0.5-0.99 ng/mL, 58.7% (54/92) for PSA levels 0.2-0.49 ng/mL, and 63.6% (7/11) for PSA levels ≤ 0.2 ng/mL. In those with PSA < 0.5 ng/mL, 47.6% (49/103) had detectable lesions, 71.4% (35/49) had disease confined to the pelvis, 22.4% (11/49) had prostate bed recurrence, 49.0% (24/49) had pelvic lymph nodes, and 28.6% (14/49) had extra pelvic disease.  Conclusion:   [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT has a high detection rate in recurrence following RP even at low PSA levels with similar detection levels in the PSA subgroups < 0.5 ng/mL. Employing rigid PSA thresholds when constructing guidelines for PSMA PET/CT funding eligibility may result in a significant number of patients below such thresholds having delayed or inappropriate treatment.""","""['Elisa Perry', 'Arpit Talwar', 'Kim Taubman', 'Michael Ng', 'Lih-Ming Wong', 'Russell Booth', 'Tom R Sutherland']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['18F-DCFPyL PET/CT Imaging in Patients with Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer After Primary Local Therapy.', 'Changes in Management After 18F-DCFPyL PSMA PET in Patients Undergoing Postprostatectomy Radiotherapy, with Early Biochemical Response Outcomes.', 'Early lesion detection with 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in 248 patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'The role of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan in biochemical recurrence after primary treatment for prostate cancer: a systematic review of the literature.', 'Detection Efficacy of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer with Very Low PSA Levels: A 7-Year, Two-Center ""Real-World"" Experience.', 'Necessity of Pelvic Lymph Node Irradiation in Patients with Recurrent Prostate Cancer after Radical Prostatectomy in the PSMA PET/CT Era: A Narrative Review.', 'The Performance of FDA-Approved PET Imaging Agents in the Detection of Prostate Cancer.', 'PEDAL protocol: a prospective single-arm paired comparison of multiparametric MRI and 18F-DCPFyl PSMA PET/CT to diagnose prostate cancer.', 'Pathological predictors of 18 F-DCFPyL prostate-specific membrane antigen-positive recurrence after radical prostatectomy.']"""

Data on worldwide gBRCApv incidence among pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients are sparse and describe a remarkable geographic heterogeneity. The aim of this study is to analyze the epidemiology of gBRCApv in Italian patients.  Materials and methods:   Patients of any age with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, screened within 3 months from diagnosis for gBRCApv in Italian oncologic centers systematically performing tests without any selection. For the purposes of our analysis, breast, ovarian, pancreas, and prostate cancer in a patient's family history was considered as potentially BRCA-associated. Patients or disease characteristics were examined using the χ2 test or Fisher's exact test for qualitative variables and the Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables, as appropriate.  Results:   Between June 2015 and May 2020, 939 patients were tested by 14 Italian centers; 492 (52%) males, median age 62 years (range 28-87), 569 (61%) metastatic, 273 (29%) with a family history of potentially BRCA-associated cancers. gBRCA1-2pv were found in 76 patients (8.1%; 9.1% in metastatic; 6.4% in non-metastatic). The gBRCA2/gBRCA1 ratio was 5.4 : 1. Patients with gBRCApv were younger compared with wild-type (59 versus 62 years, P = 0.01). The gBRCApv rate was 17.1% among patients <40 years old, 10.4% among patients 41-50 years old, 9.2% among patients 51-60 years old, 6.7% among patients aged 61-70 years, and 6.2% among patients >70 years old (none out of 94 patients >73 years old). gBRCApv frequency in 845 patients <74 years old was 9%. Patients with/without a family history of potentially BRCA-associated tumors had 14%/6% mutations.

This combined treatment induced apoptosis and subsequent reduction of the PC-3 cell proliferation and invasion, by a pro-differentiating action. Since one of the peculiar characteristics of NG and α-TOC is their strong antioxidant activity, this study aimed to investigate their potential effect on the activity of the main enzymes involved in the antioxidant mechanism in prostate cancer cells. NG and α-TOC administered singularly or combined in the PC-3 cell line, affected the activity of several enzymes biomarkers of the cellular antioxidant activity, as well as the concentration of total glutathione (GSH + GSSG) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). The combined treatment increased the TBARS levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, while decreased the glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), and glyoxalase I (GI) activities. The results obtained indicate that a combined treatment with these natural compounds mitigated the oxidative stress in the human PC-3 cell line. In addition, a significant reduction of both ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) expression and intracellular levels of polyamines, both well-known positive regulators of cell proliferation, accompanied the reduction of oxidative stress observed in the combined α-TOC and NG treatment. Considering the established role of polyamines in cell differentiation, the synergism with NG makes α-TOC a potential drug for further study on the differentiation therapy in prostate cancer patients.""","""['Piera Torricelli', 'Antonia Concetta Elia', 'Gabriele Magara', 'Giordana Feriotto', 'Cinzia Forni', 'Ilaria Borromeo', 'Angelo De Martino', 'Claudio Tabolacci', 'Carlo Mischiati', 'Simone Beninati']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Amino Acids""","""['Polyamines and heavy metal stress: the antioxidant behavior of spermine in cadmium- and copper-treated wheat leaves.', 'Thalamic superoxide and peroxide handling capacity (SPHC): An experimental study with aluminum, ethanol and tocopherol in rats.', 'Interactions between endogenous and dietary antioxidants against Pb-induced oxidative stress in wild ungulates from a Pb polluted mining area.', 'Naringenin protects against cadmium-induced oxidative renal dysfunction in rats.', 'Synergic effect of α-tocopherol and naringenin in transglutaminase-induced differentiation of human prostate cancer cells.', 'Current Understanding of Flavonoids in Cancer Therapy and Prevention.', 'Modulation of Antioxidant Defense in Farmed Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) Fed with a Diet Supplemented by the Waste Derived from the Supercritical Fluid Extraction of Basil (Ocimum basilicum).', 'Flavonoids: A Myth or a Reality for Cancer Therapy?']"""

Methods:   This retrospective study included 175 consecutive biopsy-naïve patients (40-74 years) referred with a suspicion of PCa, but with subsequent negative investigations. Patients were grouped by age into categories ≤ 54, 55-59, 60-64, and ≥ 65 years. MpMRI sequences (T2-weighted imaging [T2WI], diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI]/apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC], and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging [DCE]) were independently evaluated by two uro-radiologists on a proposed 4-point grading scale for background change on each sequence, wherein score 1 mirrored PIRADS-1 change and score 4 represented diffuse background change. Peripheral zone T2WI signal intensity and ADC values were also analyzed for trends relating to age.  Results:   There was a negative correlation between age and assigned background PZ scores for each mpMRI sequence: T2WI: r = - 0.52, DWI: r = - 0.49, DCE: r = - 0.45, p < 0.001. Patients aged ≤ 54 years had mean scores of 3.0 (T2WI), 2.7 (DWI), and 3.1 (DCE), whilst patients ≥ 65 years had significantly lower mean scores of 1.7, 1.4, and 1.9, respectively. There was moderate inter-reader agreement for all scores (range κ = 0.43-0.58). Statistically significant positive correlations were found for age versus normalized T2WI signal intensity (r = 0.2, p = 0.009) and age versus ADC values (r = 0.33, p = 0.001).  Conclusion:   The normal PZ in younger patients (≤ 54 years) demonstrates significantly lower T2WI signal intensity, lower ADC values, and diffuse enhancement on DCE, which may hinder diagnostic interpretation in these patients. The proposed standardized PZ background scoring system may help convey the potential for diagnostic uncertainty to clinicians.  Key points:   • Significant, positive correlations were found between increasing age and higher normalized T2-weighted signal intensity and mean ADC values of the prostatic peripheral zone. • Younger men exhibit lower T2-weighted imaging signal intensity, lower ADC values, and diffuse enhancement on dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging, which may hinder MRI interpretation. • A scoring system is proposed which aims towards a standardized assessment of the normal background PZ.

Methods:   Castrated mice supplemented with testosterone implant were xenografted with human LNCaP CRPC. After appropriate tumour growth, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) was carried out by the removal of the implant followed by a single injection of docetaxel (400 μg/20-g mouse) 2 weeks later. [18F]JK-PSMA-7 PET/CT were performed before ADT, then before and at days 12, 26, 47 and 69 after docetaxel administration. The [18F]JK-PSMA-7 PET data were compared to corresponding unspecific metabolic [18F]FDG PET/CT and ex vivo quantification of PSMA expression estimated by flow cytometry on repeated tumour biopsies.  Results:   ADT alone had no early effect on LNCaP tumours that pursued their progression. Until day 12 post-docetaxel, the [18F]JK-PSMA7 uptake was significantly higher than that of [18F]FDG, indicating the persistence of PSMA expression at those time points. From day 26 onwards when the tumours were rapidly expanding, both [18F]JK-PSMA7 and [18F]FDG uptake continuously decreased although the decrease in [18F]JK-PSMA uptake was markedly faster. The fraction of PSMA-positive cells in tumour biopsies decreased similarly over time to reach a non-specific level after the same time period.  Conclusion:   Applying PSMA-based imaging for therapy monitoring in patients with CRPC should be considered with caution since a reduction in [18F]JK-PSMA-7 PET uptake after successive ADT and chemotherapy may be related to downregulation of PSMA expression in dedifferentiated and rapidly proliferating tumour cells.""","""['Gaetan Van Simaeys', 'Gilles Doumont', 'Coraline De Maeseneire', 'Nicolas Passon', 'Simon Lacroix', 'Cédric Lentz', 'Arnaud Horion', 'Corentin Warnier', 'David Torres', 'Corentin Martens', 'Irina Vierasu', 'Dominique Egrise', 'Serge Goldman']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Flare on 18FPSMA-1007 PET/CT after short-term androgen deprivation therapy and its correlation to FDG uptake: possible marker of tumor aggressiveness in treatment-naïve metastatic prostate cancer patients.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'An 18F-Labeled PSMA Ligand for PET/CT of Prostate Cancer: First-in-Humans Observational Study and Clinical Experience with 18F-JK-PSMA-7 During the First Year of Application.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA-PET/CT)-guided stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy for oligometastatic prostate cancer: a single-institution experience and review of the published literature.', 'Utility of 68 Ga prostate specific membrane antigen - positron emission tomography in diagnosis and response assessment of recurrent renal cell carcinoma.', 'Development and Functional Characterization of a Versatile Radio-/Immunotheranostic Tool for Prostate Cancer Management.', 'Clinical experience with 18F-JK-PSMA-7 when using a digital PET/CT.']"""

Pharmacologic NGF blockade and NGF knockdown markedly inhibited CHRM4-mediated NEPC differentiation and AKT-MYCN signaling activation. CHRM4 stimulation was associated with ADT resistance and was significantly correlated with increased NGF in high-grade and small-cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer (SCNC) patient samples.

Using mixed 3D cultures of parental and radioresistant populations from two prostate cancer cell lines and a predator-prey mathematical model to investigate various types of ecological interactions, we show that reciprocal interactions between heterogeneous populations enhance overall growth and reduce radiation sensitivity. The type of interaction influences the time of regrowth after radiation, and, at the population level, alters the survival and cell cycle of each population without eliminating either one.

Because of their small size, low natural abundance and high sequence homology between family members they are challenging to detect using standard technologies suitable for use at the point-of-care. Herein we report the design, engineering and testing of a novel sensing strategy: electrochemically active molecular probes based on peptide nucleic acid (PNA) scaffolds for the detection of single-stranded oligonucleotides, in particular microRNAs (or miRs). As a proof-of-principle, a wide range of probes were designed and tested to detect miR-141, a known diagnostic biomarker for prostate cancer. Optimal quantitative sensing of miR-141 was achieved via the first example of an electrochemical oligonucleotide-templated reaction (EOTR), whereby two PNA probes - functionalized with an aniline and a 1,4-catechol respectively - preferentially react with each other upon simultaneous hybridization to the same RNA target strand, serving here as a template. Quantitative, electrochemical detection of the product of this bio-orthogonal reaction showed direct correlation between adduct formation and miR-141 concentration. Coupling the specificity of OTR with the speed and sensitivity of electrochemical sensing delivers EOTRs as a promising new technique for fast, low-cost, quantitative and sequence-specific detection of short nucleic acids from liquid biopsies.""","""['Philip Gillespie', 'Robert B Channon', 'Xiaotong Meng', 'Md Nazmul Islam', 'Sylvain Ladame', ""Danny O'Hare""]""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Biosens Bioelectron""","""['Amplification-Free Detection of Circulating microRNA Biomarkers from Body Fluids Based on Fluorogenic Oligonucleotide-Templated Reaction between Engineered Peptide Nucleic Acid Probes: Application to Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Electrochemical genosensor based on peptide nucleic acid-mediated PCR and asymmetric PCR techniques: Electrostatic interactions with a metal cation.', 'Nucleic acid templated reactions: consequences of probe reactivity and readout strategy for amplified signaling and sequence selectivity.', 'PNA-Based MicroRNA Detection Methodologies.', 'Molecular methods in electrochemical microRNA detection.']"""

Materials and methods:   Fifty patients with mean age of 70.48 ± 9.95 years old (range 52-87) who had metastatic PCa and received ADT between 2014 and 2019 were retrospectively evaluated. Median values of pre-therapeutic PSA and Gleason scores were 50 ng/ml (range 8-1201) and 8 (range 6-9), respectively. All patients received luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue and anti-androgen. The patients were evaluated in terms of age, pre-therapeutic PSA serum levels, Gleason scores, presence of metastasis, number and percentage of cores involved, nadir PSA, time to nadir PSA, duration of ADT, and PSA at last follow-up. Multivariate analysis was used to define the factors which have impact on ADT response. The mean follow-up period was 13.87 ± 7.78 months, (range 2-32).  Results:   All patients showed reduction in serum PSA level after initiation of ADT, and the median value of nadir PSA was 1.12 ng/ml (range 0.02-50). The mean value of time to nadir PSA was 3.85 ± 1.57 months (range 2-7). The median value of PSA at last follow-up was 2 ng/ml (range 0.02-50.21). Multi-variant analysis showed that nadir PSA have a significant correlation with pre-therapeutic PSA, PSA at last follow-up, age, and Gleason scores (p < .05).  Conclusion:   Standard ADT is a feasible option in the treatment of metastatic PCa. Gleason scores, age, pre-therapeutic PSA, and PSA at last follow-up have significant impact on outcomes of ADT. Further studies of high number of patients with long-term follow-up including other chemo-hormonal therapy and androgen receptor blockers should be carried out to confirm and improve efficacy of ADT.""","""['Mahmoud Mustafa', 'Honood Abu Rass', 'Mothafr Yahya', 'Khaleel Hamdan', 'Yazan Eiss']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""World J Surg Oncol""","""['Time to prostate-specific antigen nadir independently predicts overall survival in patients who have metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer treated with androgen-deprivation therapy.', 'Testosterone levels in patients with metastatic prostate cancer treated with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone therapy: prognostic significance?', 'Detectable prostate-specific antigen Nadir during androgen-deprivation therapy predicts adverse prostate cancer-specific outcomes: results from the SEARCH database.', 'Extreme-risk prostate adenocarcinoma presenting with prostate-specific antigen (PSA)>40 ng/ml: prognostic significance of the preradiation PSA nadir.', 'Predictive factor analysis of time to progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer after androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Prognostic significance of lncRNA AP004608.1 in prostate cancer.', 'Cholesterol-Based Nanovesicles Enhance the In Vitro Cytotoxicity, Ex Vivo Intestinal Absorption, and In Vivo Bioavailability of Flutamide.']"""

Prostate cancer shows a strong tendency to form metastatic foci in the bones. A number of interactions between cancer cells attacking bones and cells of the bone matrix lead to destruction of the bone and growth of the tumour. The last few decades have seen increased interest in the precise role of minerals in human health and disease. Tumour cells accumulate various minerals that promote their intensive growth. Bone, as a storehouse of elements, can be a valuable source of them for the growing tumour. There are also reports suggesting that the presence of some tumours, e.g., of the breast, can adversely affect bone structure even in the absence of metastasis to this organ. This paper presents the effect of chronic dietary intake of calcium, iron and zinc, administered in doses corresponding maximally to twice their level in a standard diet, on homeostasis of selected elements (Ca, K, Zn, Fe, Cu, Sr, Ni, Co, Mn and Mo) in the femoral bones of healthy rats and rats with implanted cancer cells of the LNCaP line. The experiment was conducted over 90 days. After the adaptation period, the animals were randomly divided into four dietary groups: standard diet and supplementation with Zn, Fe and Ca. Every dietary group was divided into experimental group (with implanted cancer cells) and control group (without implanted cancer cells). The cancer cells (LnCaP) were implanted intraperitoneally in the amount 1 × 106 to the rats at day 90 of their lifetime. Bone tissue was dried and treated with microwave-assisted mineral digestation. Total elemental content was quantified by ICP-MS. Student's t-test and Anova or Kruskal-Wallis tests were applied in order to compare treatment and dietary groups. In the case of most of the diets, especially the standard diet, the femoral bones of rats with implanted LNCaP cells showed a clear downward trend in the content of the elements tested, which may be indicative of slow osteolysis taking place in the bone tissue. In the group of rats receiving the standard diet, there were significant reductions in the content of Mo (by 83%), Ca (25%), Co (22%), Mn (13%), K (13%) and Sr (9%) in the bone tissue of rats with implanted LNCaP cells in comparison with the control group receiving the same diet but without LNCaP implantation. Supplementation of the rat diet with calcium, zinc and iron decreased the frequency of these changes relative to the standard diet, which may indicate that the diet had an inhibitory effect on bone resorption in conditions of LNCaP implantation. The principal component analysis (PCA) score plot confirms the pronounced effect of implanted LNCaP cells and the standard diet on bone composition. At the same time, supplementation with calcium, zinc and iron seems to improve bone composition. The microelements that most often underwent quantitative changes in the experimental conditions were cobalt, manganese and molybdenum.""","""['Dorota Skrajnowska', 'Agata Jagielska', 'Anna Ruszczyńska', 'Barbara Wagner', 'Wojciech Bielecki', 'Barbara Bobrowska-Korczak']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Nutrients""","""[""Effect of Copper and Selenium Supplementation on the Level of Elements in Rats' Femurs under Neoplastic Conditions."", 'The effect of zinc and phytoestrogen supplementation on the changes in mineral content of the femur of rats with chemically induced mammary carcinogenesis.', 'Reducing mineral usage in feedlot diets for Nellore cattle: II.

Aggressive chemotherapy is a traditional treatment regimen that induces severe systemic toxicities. Therefore, bone-directed therapies are highly warranted. We report a novel nanoparticle formulation that is composed of poly(vinylpyrrolidone) and tannic acid core nanoparticles (PVT NPs) that forms self-assembly with zoledronic acid (ZA@PVT NPs). The construction of ZA@PVT NPs was confirmed by particle size, zeta potential, transmission electron microscopy, and spectral analyses. An optimized bone-targeted ZA@PVT NPs formulation showed greater binding and internalization in in vitro with metastasis prostate and breast cancer cells. ZA@PVT NPs were able to deliver ZA more efficiently to tumor cells, which inhibited proliferation of human prostate and breast cancer cells.

This public health concern has inspired considerable effort to study various aspects of prostate cancer treatment using dynamical models, especially in clinical settings. The standard of care for metastatic prostate cancer is hormonal therapy, which reduces the production of androgen that fuels the growth of prostate tumor cells prior to treatment resistance. Existing population models often use patients' prostate-specific antigen levels as a biomarker for model validation and for finding optimal treatment schedules; however, the synergistic effects of drugs used in hormonal therapy have not been well-examined. This paper describes the first mathematical model that explicitly incorporates the synergistic effects of two drugs used to inhibit androgen production in hormonal therapy. The drugs are cyproterone acetate, representing the drug family of anti-androgens that affect luteinizing hormones, and leuprolide acetate, representing the drug family of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs. By fitting the model to clinical data, we show that the proposed model can capture the dynamics of serum androgen levels during intermittent hormonal therapy better than previously published models. Our results highlight the importance of considering the synergistic effects of drugs in cancer treatment, thus suggesting that the dynamics of the drugs should be taken into account in optimal treatment studies, particularly for adaptive therapy. Otherwise, an unrealistic treatment schedule may be prescribed and render the treatment less effective. Furthermore, the drug dynamics allow our model to explain the delay in the relapse of androgen the moment a patient is taken off treatment, which supports that this delay is due to the residual effects of the drugs.""","""['Trevor Reckell', 'Kyle Nguyen', 'Tin Phan', 'Sharon Crook', 'Eric J Kostelich', 'Yang Kuang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Theor Biol""","""['Intermittent androgen deprivation therapy in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Intermittent complete androgen blockade in PSA relapse after radical prostatectomy and incidental prostate cancer.', 'The long-term results with delayed-combined androgen blockade therapy in local or locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Final results of the Canadian prospective phase II trial of intermittent androgen suppression for men in biochemical recurrence after radiotherapy for locally advanced prostate cancer: clinical parameters.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy with Leuprolide acetate for treatment of advanced prostate cancer.', 'Practical Understanding of Cancer Model Identifiability in Clinical Applications.', 'High Accuracy Indicators of Androgen Suppression Therapy Failure for Prostate Cancer-A Modeling Study.']"""

Objective:   This study evaluated the accuracy of Proclarix, a novel blood-based diagnostic test, to help in biopsy decision-making in this challenging patient population.  Design, setting, and participants:   Ten clinical sites prospectively enrolled 457 men presenting for prostate biopsy with PSA between 2 and 10 ng/ml, normal DRE, and prostate volume ≥35 cm3. Transrectal ultrasound-guided and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI)-guided biopsy techniques were allowed.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Serum samples were tested blindly at the end of the study. Diagnostic performance of Proclarix risk score was established in correlation to systematic biopsy outcome and its performance compared with %free PSA (%fPSA) and the European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) risk calculator (RC) as well as Proclarix density compared with PSA density in men undergoing mpMRI.  Results and limitations:   The sensitivity of Proclarix risk score for clinically significant PCa (csPCa) defined as grade group (GG) ≥2 was 91% (n = 362), with higher specificity than both %fPSA (22% vs 14%; difference = 8% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 2.6-14%], p = 0.005) and RC (22% vs 15%; difference = 7% [95% CI, 0.7-12%], p = 0.028). In the subset of men undergoing mpMRI-fusion biopsy (n = 121), the specificity of Proclarix risk score was significantly higher than PSA density (26% vs 8%; difference = 18% [95% CI, 7-28%], p < 0.001), and at equal sensitivity of 97%, Proclarix density had an even higher specificity of 33% [95% CI, 23-43%].  Conclusions:   In a routine use setting, Proclarix accurately discriminated csPCa from no or insignificant PCa in the most challenging patients. Proclarix represents a valuable rule-out test in the diagnostic algorithm for PCa, alone or in combination with mpMRI.

Because of the substantial rise of the Prostate-Specific Antigen and the Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA), cancer vaccination should be rendered with these antigens. Through pharmacodynamic experiments in a library of natural compounds from ZINC database, the current research sought to identify compounds that could suppress PSMA protein. To test the most productive compounds for further research, the Library has been scanned with Pharmacophore and ADMET analysis followed by molecular docking methods in the first phase. After selecting 15 ligands with the best pose related to docking results, to evaluate the stability of the ligand-protein bounds of the compounds, a molecular dynamics simulation considering the effect of the presence of zinc ions on the protein structure was performed. The measurement of ligand binding modes and free energy has shown that four compounds, including Z10, Z06, Z01, and Z03, have formed critical interactions with the active site's residues. Besides, multiple approaches were employed to determine their inhibition rating and describe the variables that facilitate the attachment of ligands to the protein active site. The results are obtained from the MMPBSA/GBSA analysis of four selected small molecules (Z10, Z06, Z01, and Z03), which are very close to the IC50 value of reference ligand (DCIBzl); they are -13.85 kcal/mol, -12.58 kcal/mol, -10.71 kcal/mol and -9.39 kcal/mol respectively.

Evidence suggests that these pathways may also increase prostate cancer risk.  Objective:   To determine whether hyperinsulinemic diet and inflammatory diet are associated with prostate cancer incidence and mortality.  Design, setting, and participants:   We prospectively followed 41 209 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986-2014). Scores for two validated dietary patterns were calculated from food frequency questionnaires at baseline and updated every 4 yr.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Total, advanced, and lethal prostate cancer outcomes were assessed. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined for associations between two empirical hypothesis-oriented dietary patterns-empirical dietary index for hyperinsulinemia and empirical dietary inflammatory pattern-and prostate cancer risk estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression.  Results and limitations:   During 28 yr of follow-up, 5929 incident cases of total prostate cancer, including 1019 advanced and 667 fatal, were documented. In multivariable-adjusted models, there was a 7% higher risk of advanced prostate cancer (HR: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.01-1.15) and a 9% higher risk of fatal prostate cancer (HR: 1.09; 95% CI: 1.00-1.18) per standard deviation (SD) increase in the hyperinsulinemic diet. When stratified by age, the hyperinsulinemic diet was associated with only earlier-onset aggressive prostate cancer (men under 65 yr), with per SD HRs of 1.20 (95% CI: 1.06-1.35) for advanced, 1.22 (1.04-1.42) for fatal, and 1.20 (1.04-1.38) for lethal. The inflammatory diet was not associated with prostate cancer risk in the overall study population, but was associated with earlier-onset lethal prostate cancer (per SD increase HR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.00-1.35).  Conclusions:   Hyperinsulinemia and inflammation may be potential mechanisms linking dietary patterns with the risk of aggressive prostate cancer, particularly earlier-onset disease.

Prostatectomy and breast conservative surgery remain the most common definitive treatment option for the >500,000 men and women newly diagnosed with localized prostate and breast cancer each year only in the US. Morphological examination is the mainstay of diagnosis but margin under-sampling of the excised cancer tissue may lead to local recurrence. In despite of the progress of non-invasive optical imaging, there is still a clinical need for targeted optical imaging probes that could rapidly and globally visualize cancerous tissues.  Methods:   Elevated expression of junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) on tumor cells and its multiple pro-tumorigenic activity make the JAM-A a candidate for molecular imaging. Near-infrared imaging probe, which employed anti-JAM-A monoclonal antibody (mAb) phthalocyanine dye IR700 conjugates (JAM-A mAb/IR700), was synthesized and used to identify and visualize heterotopic human prostate and breast tumor mouse xenografts in vivo.  Results:   The intravenously injected JAM-A mAb/IR700 conjugates enabled the non-invasive detection of prostate and breast cancerous tissue by fluorescence imaging. A single dose of JAM-A mAb/IR700 reduced number of mitotic cancer cells in vivo, indicating theranostic ability of this imaging agent. The JAM-A mAb/IR700 conjugates allowed us to image a specific receptor expression in prostate and breast tumors without post-image processing.  Conclusion:   This agent demonstrates promise as a method to image the extent of prostate and breast cancer in vivo and could assist with real-time visualization of extracapsular extension of cancerous tissue.""","""['E Walker', 'S M Turaga', 'X Wang', 'R Gopalakrishnan', 'S Shukla', 'J P Basilion', 'J D Lathia']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Transl Oncol""","""['A Novel Theranostic Combination of Near-infrared Fluorescence Imaging and Laser Irradiation Targeting c-KIT for Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors.', '3D mesoscopic fluorescence tomography for imaging micro-distribution of antibody-photon absorber conjugates during near infrared photoimmunotherapy in vivo.', 'Combination photoimmunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies recognizing different epitopes of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2: an assessment of phototherapeutic effect based on fluorescence molecular imaging.', 'Cleavage of the extracellular domain of junctional adhesion molecule-A is associated with resistance to anti-HER2 therapies in breast cancer settings.', 'Real-time monitoring of microdistribution of antibody-photon absorber conjugates during photoimmunotherapy in vivo.', 'Near Infrared Photoimmunotherapy: A Review of Recent Progress and Their Target Molecules for Cancer Therapy.']"""

In this study, we engineered Rana pipiens RNase to bind to the scFv of human antiepidermal growth factor receptor antibody. The molecular dynamic simulations confirmed protein stability and the ability of scFv-ranpirnase (rantoxin) to bind to epidermal growth factor receptor protein. Then, the rantoxin construct was synthesized in a pCDNA 3.1 Neo vector. CHO-K1 cells were used as expression hosts and the construct was transfected. Cells were selected by antibiotic therapies using neomycin, 120 mg/ml, and the high-yield colony was screened by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. Then, the recombinant protein production was confirmed using the sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blot analyses. The molecular dynamic simulation (MDS) confirmed that the I467, S468, Q408, and H409 amino acids of EGFR bonded well to rantoxin. As revealed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and western blot analyses, the rantoxin production and PCR analysis showed that the T3 colony can produce rantoxin messenger RNA fourfold higher than the GAPDH gene.

Objectives:   The aim of the study was to determine the effects of consumption of a lycopene-enriched commercial product of organic, extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) on prostate health, sleep quality, antioxidant status, and anxiety.  Design:   The research team designed a pilot study with two intervention groups.  Setting:   The study took place in the city of Badajoz (Extremadura, Spain).  Participants:   Participants were 20 men aged ≥50, some of whom were healthy and some of whom had received a diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia.  Intervention:   Participants were divided into a healthy-men (HM) group (n = 10) and a benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) group (n = 10). Both groups consumed 20 ml of lycopene (0.4 mg/ml) daily in a lycopene-enriched commercial product of organic extra virgin olive oil, at breakfast and/or lunch, for 30 days.  Outcome measures:   Sleep quality, prostate markers-prostatic specific antigen and protein C reactive-and symptomatology, urine total antioxidant status, and emotional health were assessed at baseline and postintervention.  Results:   The level of prostatic specific antigen and symptomatology remarkably improved in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia, although the changes wasn't statistically significant, and the total antioxidant status was significantly increased in healthy men (P < .05). Sleep quality in terms of nocturnal activity was significantly improved in both groups (P < .05). No adverse events were reported.

Rapid uncontrolled growth and the ability to metastasize to other sites are key hallmarks in cancer development and progression. The Rho family of GTPases and its activators the GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) are required for regulating cancer cell proliferation and migration. StarD13 is a GAP for Rho GTPases, specifically for RhoA and Cdc42. We have previously shown that StarD13 acts as a tumor suppressor in astrocytoma as well as breast and colorectal cancer. In this study, we performed a functional comparative analysis of StarD13 targets/and or interacting molecules to understand the general role that StarD13 plays in cancers. Our data highlight the importance of StarD13 in modulating several hallmarks of cancer. Findings from database mining and immunohistochemistry revealed that StarD13 is underexpressed in prostate cancers, in addition knocking down Stard13 increased cancer cell proliferation, consistent with its role as a tumor suppressor. Stard13 depletion, however, led to an increase in cell adhesion, which inhibited 2D cell migration. Most interestingly, StarD13 depletion increases invasion and matrix degradation, at least in part, through its regulation of Cdc42. Altogether, the data presented suggest that StarD13 acts as a tumor suppressor inhibiting prostate cancer cell invasion.""","""['Leila Jaafar', 'Isabelle Fakhoury', 'Sahar Saab', 'Layal El-Hajjar', 'Wassim Abou-Kheir', 'Mirvat El-Sibai']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Hum Cell""","""['Differential regulation of rho GTPases during lung adenocarcinoma migration and invasion reveals a novel role of the tumor suppressor StarD13 in invadopodia regulation.', 'Effect of StarD13 on colorectal cancer proliferation, motility and invasion.', 'StarD13 is a tumor suppressor in breast cancer that regulates cell motility and invasion.', 'StarD13: a potential star target for tumor therapeutics.', 'GAP-independent functions of DLC1 in metastasis.', 'Loss of STARD13 contributes to aggressive phenotype transformation and poor prognosis in papillary thyroid carcinoma.', 'Circ_0003570 Suppresses the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma through miR-182-5p/STARD13 regulatory axis.']"""

Background:   Nowadays, scandium-44 has received significant attention as a potential radionuclide with favorable characteristics for PET applications. A polyaminopolycarboxylate heptadentate ligand based on a 1,4-diazepine scaffold (AAZTA) has been thoroughly studied as chelator for Gd3+ ions for MRI applications. The excellent results of the equilibrium, kinetic, and labeling studies led to a preliminary assessment of the in vitro and in vivo behavior of [44Sc][Sc-(AAZTA)]- and two derivatives, i.e., [44Sc][Sc (CNAAZTA-BSA)] and [44Sc][Sc (CNAAZTA-cRGDfK)].  Results:   B28110 was synthesized by hybrid approach, combining solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and solution chemistry to obtain high purity (97%) product with an overall yield of 9%. Subsequently, the radioactive labeling was performed with scandium-44 produced from natural calcium target in cyclotron, in good radiochemical yields (RCY) under mild condition (pH 4, 298 K). Stability study in human plasma showed good RCP% of [44Sc]Sc-B28110 up to 24 h (94.32%). In vivo PET/MRI imaging on LNCaP tumor-bearing mice showed high tracer accumulation in the tumor regions as early as 20 min post-injection.

Next-generation sequencing of TCR repertoire was performed on these NSCLC patients' peripheral blood samples at baseline and day 15. Though patients' TCR repertoire diversity showed mixed responses to the treatment, patients exhibiting increased diversity on day 15 attained significantly longer overall survival (OS) (median OS was not reached vs 17.2 months for those with decreased diversity, p = 0.015). We applied network analysis to assess convergent T cell clonotypes indicative of an antigen-driven immune response. Patients with larger TCR clusters had improved OS (median OS was not reached vs 13.1 months for patients with smaller TCR clusters, p = 0.013).

We estimated the benefit of additional SNPs on performance of a previously validated PHS (PHS46).  Materials and method:   180 SNPs, shown to be previously associated with prostate cancer, were used to develop a PHS model in men with European ancestry. A machine-learning approach, LASSO-regularized Cox regression, was used to select SNPs and to estimate their coefficients in the training set (75,596 men). Performance of the resulting model was evaluated in the testing/validation set (6,411 men) with two metrics: (1) hazard ratios (HRs) and (2) positive predictive value (PPV) of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing. HRs were estimated between individuals with PHS in the top 5% to those in the middle 40% (HR95/50), top 20% to bottom 20% (HR80/20), and bottom 20% to middle 40% (HR20/50). PPV was calculated for the top 20% (PPV80) and top 5% (PPV95) of PHS as the fraction of individuals with elevated PSA that were diagnosed with clinically significant prostate cancer on biopsy.  Results:   166 SNPs had non-zero coefficients in the Cox model (PHS166). All HR metrics showed significant improvements for PHS166 compared to PHS46: HR95/50 increased from 3.72 to 5.09, HR80/20 increased from 6.12 to 9.45, and HR20/50 decreased from 0.41 to 0.34. By contrast, no significant differences were observed in PPV of PSA testing for clinically significant prostate cancer.

MAOA promotes PNI of PC cells in vitro and tumor innervation in an orthotopic xenograft model. Mechanistically, MAOA activates SEMA3C in a Twist1-dependent transcriptional manner, which in turn stimulates cMET to facilitate PNI via autocrine or paracrine interaction with coactivated PlexinA2 and NRP1. Furthermore, MAOA inhibitor treatment effectively reduces PNI of PC cells in vitro and tumor-infiltrating nerve fiber density along with suppressed xenograft tumor growth and progression in mice.

To examine a putative causal effect of vitamin D across phenotypic domains and disease categories, we conducted Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses using genetic instruments associated with circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations. We leveraged genome-wide significant 25(OH)D-associated SNPs (N = 138) from a meta-analysis combining a vitamin D GWAS conducted in 401,460 white British UK Biobank (UKBB) participants and an independent vitamin D GWAS including 42,274 samples of European ancestry, and examined 190 large-scale health-related GWAS spanning a broad spectrum of complex traits, diseases and biomarkers. We applied multiple MR methods to estimate the causal effect of vitamin D while testing and controlling for potential biases from horizontal pleiotropy. Consistent with previous findings, genetically predicted increased 25(OH)D levels significantly decreased the risk of multiple sclerosis (OR = 0.824; 95% CI 0.689-0.986). The protective effect estimate was consistent across different MR methods and four different multiple sclerosis GWAS with varying sample sizes and genotyping platforms. On the contrary, we found limited evidence in support of a causal effect of 25(OH)D on anthropometric traits, obesity, cognitive function, sleep behavior, breast and prostate cancer, and autoimmune, cardiovascular, metabolic, neurological and psychiatric traits and diseases, and blood biomarkers.

A new therapeutic radiopharmaceutical for bone metastasis is 177Lu-DOTA-zoledronic acid (177Lu-DOTA-ZOL). In this study, the safety and dosimetry of a single therapeutic dose of 177Lu-DOTA-ZOL were evaluated on the basis of a series of SPECT/CT images and blood samples. Methods: Nine patients with exclusive bone metastases from metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) (70.8 ± 8.4 y) and progression under conventional therapies participated in this prospective study. After receiving 5,780 ± 329 MBq 177Lu-DOTA-ZOL, patients underwent 3-dimensional whole-body SPECT/CT imaging and venous blood sampling over 7 d. Dosimetric evaluation was performed for main organs and tumor lesions. Safety was assessed by blood biomarkers. Results:177Lu-DOTA-ZOL showed fast uptake and high retention in bone lesions and fast clearance from the bloodstream in all patients. The average retention in tumor lesions was 0.02% injected activity per gram at 6 h after injection and approximately 0.01% at 170 h after injection. In this cohort, the average absorbed doses in bone tumor lesions, kidneys, red bone marrow, and bone surfaces were 4.21, 0.17, 0.36, and 1.19 Gy/GBq, respectively. The red marrow was found to be the dose-limiting organ for all patients. A median maximum tolerated injected activity of 6.0 GBq may exceed the defined threshold of 2 Gy for the red bone marrow in individual patients (4/8).

Aim:   The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a single administration of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor antagonist, degarelix, on sexual incentive motivation (SIM), sexual reward, consummatory sexual behaviors, anxiety-like behavior, and androgen receptor signaling in male rats, and to determine if sexual stimulation attenuates the effects of degarelix on SIM.  Methods:   Male rats were treated with degarelix, or vehicle, and half of the rats in each condition were briefly exposed to a sexually receptive female immediately before SIM trials (experiment 1). Rats treated with degarelix or vehicle were also given a sex-conditioned place preference test (experiment 2A), weekly mating tests (experiment 2B), and an elevated zero maze test (experiment 3). Androgen-sensitive tissues were excised upon completion of testing.  Outcomes:   SIM was indicated by the percentage of time spent near a sexually receptive female on the SIM tests. The percentage of time spent in the chamber of a conditioned place preference maze associated with sexual experience was indicative of sexual reward. The percentage of trials in which a mount, intromission, and ejaculation occurred was indicative of copulatory ability. Sexual performance was characterized by the average latencies to first exhibit these behaviors, as well as the average frequency of these behaviors. Anxiety-like behavior was indicated by the percentage of time in the open zones of an elevated zero maze. Relative weights of the seminal vesicles and bulbourethral glands were used to quantify androgen activity.  Results:   Rats treated with degarelix exhibited lower levels of SIM. In rats treated with degarelix, contact with a female immediately before SIM testing increased activity, but not SIM. Treatment with degarelix reduced the rewarding aspects of sexual behavior, as well as most aspects of copulatory ability and sexual performance. Degarelix treatment reduced androgen signaling, but did not impact anxiety-like behavior.  Clinical implications:   The behavioral side effects associated with the use of degarelix may be restricted to sexual behaviors.  Strengths & limitations:   Strengths include the objective measurement of sexual behaviors. The study is limited in that only one ADT was examined.  Conclusion:   These findings serve as an extension of previous preclinical studies as they indicate that gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor antagonism in male rats also attenuates sexual motivation and sexual reward, in addition to copulatory ability and sexual performance.

However, current definitions of oligometastasis are solely numerical.  Objective:   To characterize the somatic mutational landscape across the disease spectrum of metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) to elucidate a biological definition of oligometastatic CSPC.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a retrospective study of men with mCSPC who underwent clinical-grade sequencing of their tumors (269 primary tumor, 25 metastatic sites). Patients were classified as having biochemically recurrent (ie, micrometastatic), metachronous oligometastatic (≤5 lesions), metachronous polymetastatic (>5 lesions), or de novo metastatic (metastasis at diagnosis) disease.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We measured the frequency of driver mutations across metastatic classifications and the genomic associations with radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and time to castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  Results and limitations:   The frequency of driver mutations in TP53 (p = 0.01), WNT (p = 0.08), and cell cycle (p = 0.04) genes increased across the mCSPC spectrum. TP53 mutation was associated with shorter rPFS (26.7 vs 48.6 mo; p = 0.002), and time to CRPC (95.6 vs 155.8 mo; p = 0.02) in men with oligometastasis, and identified men with polymetastasis with better rPFS (TP53 wild-type, 42.7 mo; TP53 mutated, 18.5 mo; p = 0.01). Mutations in TP53 (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.45; p = 0.004) and DNA double-strand break repair (IRR 1.61; p < 0.001) were associated with a higher number of metastases. Mutations in TP53 were also independently associated with shorter rPFS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.59; p = 0.03) and the development of CRPC (HR 1.71; p = 0.01) on multivariable analysis. This study was limited by its retrospective nature, sample size, and the use of commercially available sequencing platforms, resulting in a limited predefined set of genes examined.  Conclusions:   Somatic mutational profiles reveal a spectrum of metastatic biology that helps in redefining oligometastasis beyond a simple binary state of lesion enumeration.  Patient summary:   Oligometastatic prostate cancer is typically defined as less than three to five metastatic lesions and evidence suggests that using radiation or surgery to treat these sites improves clinical outcomes. As of now, treatment decisions for oligometastasis are solely defined according to the number of lesions. However, this study suggests that tumor mutational profiles can provide a biological definition of oligometastasis and complement currently used numerical definitions.""","""['Matthew P Deek', 'Kim Van der Eecken', 'Ryan Phillips', 'Neil R Parikh', 'Pedro Isaacsson Velho', 'Tamara L Lotan', 'Amar U Kishan', 'Tobias Maurer;GAP Consortium;Paul C Boutros', 'Christopher Hovens', 'Matthew Abramowtiz', 'Alan Pollack', 'Neil Desai', 'Bradley Stish', 'Felix Y Feng', 'Mario Eisenberger', 'Michael Carducci', 'Kenneth J Pienta', 'Mark Markowski', 'Channing J Paller', 'Emmanuel S Antonarakis', 'Alejandro Berlin', 'Piet Ost', 'Phuoc T Tran']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Definitions of disease burden across the spectrum of metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer: comparison by disease outcomes and genomics.', 'Compound Genomic Alterations of TP53, PTEN, and RB1 Tumor Suppressors in Localized and Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Prognostic Value of Germline DNA Repair Gene Mutations in De Novo Metastatic and Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer.', 'Novel Insights into the Management of Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

California Cancer Registry mandated electronic reporting (e-path) of structured data elements from pathologists diagnosing cancer thereby creating an opportunity to identify and approach patients rapidly. This study tested the utility of an online CT matching tool (called Trial Library) used in combination with e-path to improve matching of underrepresented CaP patients into CTs at time of diagnosis.  Methods:   This was a nonrandomized, single-arm feasibility study among patients with a new pathologic diagnosis of high-risk CaP (Gleason Score ≥8). Eligible patients were sent recruitment materials and enrolled patients were introduced to Trial Library.  Results:   A total of 419 case listings were assessed. Patients were excluded due to physician contraindication, not meeting baseline eligibility, or unable to be reached. Final participants (N = 52) completed a baseline survey. Among study participants, 77% were White, 10% were Black/Hispanic/Missing, and 14% were Asian. The majority of the study participants were over 65 years of age (81%) and Medicare insured (62%). Additionally, 81% of participants reported using the Internet to learn about CaP. The majority (62%) of participants reported that Trial Library increased their interest in CT participation.  Conclusions:   The current study demonstrated that leveraging structured e-path data reporting to a population-based cancer registry to recruit men with high risk CaP to clinical research is feasible and acceptable. We observed that e-path may be linked with an online CT matching tool, Trial Library. Future studies will prioritize recruitment from reporting facilities that serve more racially/ethnically diverse patient populations.""","""['Hala T Borno', 'Christine Duffy', 'Sylvia Zhang', 'Alison J Canchola', 'Zinnia Loya', 'Todd Golden', 'Debora L Oh', 'Anobel Y Odisho', 'Scarlett Gomez']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma Clinical Trials: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Lung Cancer Screening Eligibility.', 'A step towards equitable clinical trial recruitment: a protocol for the development and preliminary testing of an online prostate cancer health information and clinical trial matching tool.', 'Behavioral and Pharmacotherapy Weight Loss Interventions to Prevent Obesity-Related Morbidity and Mortality in Adults: An Updated Systematic Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Involving South Asian patients in clinical trials.']"""

Androgens and their receptor are the primary driving cause of prostate cancer growth and eventually castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). De novo steroidogenesis has been identified as a key mechanism that develops during CRPC. Currently, there is very limited information available on human prostate tissue steroidogenesis. The purpose of the present study was to investigate steroid metabolism in human prostate cancer tissues with comparison between PZ and TZ. Human prostate cancer tumors were procured from the patients who underwent radical prostatectomy without any neoadjuvant therapy. Human prostate homogenates were used to quantify steroid levels intrinsically present in the tissues as well as formed after incubation with 2 µg/mL of 17-hydroxypregnenolone (17-OH-pregnenolone) or progesterone. A Waters Acquity ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to a Quattro Premier XE tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer using a C18 column was used to measure thirteen steroids from the classical and backdoor steroidogenesis pathways. The intrinsic prostate tissue steroid levels were similar between PZ and TZ with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), pregnenolone and 17-OH-pregnenolone levels higher than the other steroids measured. Interestingly, 5-pregnan-3,20-dione, 5-pregnan-3-ol-20-one, and 5-pregnan-17-ol-3,20-dione formation was significantly higher in both the zones of prostate tissues, whereas, androstenedione, testosterone, DHT, and progesterone levels were significantly lower after 60 min incubation compared to the 0 min control incubations. The incubations with progesterone had a similar outcome with 5-pregnan-3,20-dione and 5-pregnan-3-ol-20-one levels were elevated and the levels of DHT were lower in both PZ and TZ tissues. The net changes in steroid formation after the incubation were more observable with 17-OH-pregnenolone than with progesterone. In our knowledge, this is the first report of comprehensive analyses of intrinsic prostate tissue steroids and precursor-driven steroid metabolism using a sensitive liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry assay. In summary, the PZ and TZ of human prostate exhibited similar steroidogenic ability with distinction in the manner each zone utilizes the steroid precursors to divert the activity towards backdoor pathway through a complex matrix of steroidogenic mechanisms.""","""['Subrata Deb', 'Mei Yieng Chin', 'Steven Pham', 'Hans Adomat', 'Antonio Hurtado-Coll', 'Martin E Gleave', 'Emma S Tomlinson Guns']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Characterization of Precursor-Dependent Steroidogenesis in Human Prostate Cancer Models.', 'The 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione pathway and C11-oxy C21 backdoor pathway are active in benign prostatic hyperplasia yielding 11keto-testosterone and 11keto-progesterone.', 'Next-generation steroidogenesis inhibitors, dutasteride and abiraterone, attenuate but still do not eliminate androgen biosynthesis in 22RV1 cells in vitro.', 'Pathways and genes involved in steroid hormone metabolism in male pigs: a review and update.', 'Assessment of steroidogenesis and steroidogenic enzyme functions.', 'Dietary Progesterone Contributes to Intratissue Levels of Progesterone in Male Mice.', 'Preclinical and Clinical Research Models of Prostate Cancer: A Brief Overview.', 'Role of single nucleotide polymorphisms of the HSD3B1 gene (rs6203 and rs33937873) in the prediction of prostate cancer risk.', 'In Vitro Analysis of Deoxynivalenol Influence on Steroidogenesis in Prostate.', 'Inhibition of Scavenger Receptor Class B Type 1 (SR-B1) Expression and Activity as a Potential Novel Target to Disrupt Cholesterol Availability in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

Hence, it is imperative to understand the complex metastatic cascade to develop therapeutic interventions for treating metastatic prostate cancer. Increasing evidence suggests the synergistic role of biochemical and biophysical cues in cancer progression at metastases. However, the mechanism underlying the crosstalk between interstitial flow-induced mechanical stimuli and prostate cancer progression at the bone microenvironment remains poorly understood. To this end, we have developed a three-dimensional (3D)in vitrodynamic model of prostate cancer bone metastasis using perfusion bioreactor and compared our results with static conditions to delineate the role of flow-induced shear stress on prostate cancer progression at metastases. We observed an increase in human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSCs) proliferation and differentiation rate under the dynamic culture. The hMSCs form cell agglutinates under static culture, whereas the hMSCs exhibited a directional alignment with broad and flattened morphology under dynamic culture. Further, the expression of mesenchymal to epithelial transition biomarkers is increased in bone metastasized prostate cancer models, and large changes are observed in the cellular and tumoroid morphologies under dynamic culture. Evaluation of cell adhesion proteins indicated that the altered cancer cell morphologies resulted from the constant force pulling due to increased E-cadherin and phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase proteins under shear stress.

To understand this cancer cell state we generated models of treatment persistence that simulate the residual tumors. We observe that treatment-persistent tumor cells in organoids, xenografts, and cancer patients adopt a distinct and reversible transcriptional program resembling that of embryonic diapause, a dormant stage of suspended development triggered by stress and associated with suppressed Myc activity and overall biosynthesis. In cancer cells, depleting Myc or inhibiting Brd4, a Myc transcriptional co-activator, attenuates drug cytotoxicity through a dormant diapause-like adaptation with reduced apoptotic priming. Conversely, inducible Myc upregulation enhances acute chemotherapeutic activity. Maintaining residual cells in dormancy after chemotherapy by inhibiting Myc activity or interfering with the diapause-like adaptation by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinase 9 represent potential therapeutic strategies against chemotherapy-persistent tumor cells.

Patients who underwent radical prostatectomy in 2013 were retrospectively analyzed in a cancer center over a 5-year period. Fifty-six patients underwent RALP and 149 patients underwent retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP). The amounts were subject to a 5% discount as correction of monetary value considering time elapsed. Calculation of the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICER) related to events avoided and the Incremental Cost-Utility Ratio (ICUR) related to ""QALY saved"" were performed. QALY was performed using values of utility and ""disutility"" weights from the ""Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry"". Hypothetical cohorts were simulated with 1000 patients in each group, based on the treatment outcomes. Total and average costs were R$1,903,671.93, and R$12,776.32 for the RRP group, and R$1,373,987.26, and R$24,535.49 for the RALP group, respectively. The costs to treat the hypothetical cohorts were R$10,010,582.35 for RRP, and R$19,224,195.90 for RALP. ICER calculation evidenced R$9,213,613.55 of difference between groups. ICUR was R$ 22,690.83 per QALY saved. Limitations were the lack of cost-effectiveness analyses related to re-hospitalization rates and complications, single center perspective, and currency-translation differences.

Therefore, patients with biochemical recurrence (BCR) of prostate cancer frequently undergo FCH as the 1st-line PET/CT. Actually, the positivity rate (PR) of a second-line PSMA-11 PET/CT in case of negative FCH PET/CT has only been reported in few short series, in a total of 185 patients. Our aims were to check (1) whether the excellent PR reported with PSMA-11 is also obtained in BCR patients whose recent FCH PET/CT was negative or equivocal; (2) in which biochemical and clinical context a high PSMA-11 PET/CT PR may be expected in those patients, in particular revealing an oligometastatic pattern; (3) whether among the various imaging protocols for PSMA-11 PET/CT used in France, one yields a significantly highest PR; (4) the tolerance of PSMA-11.  Patients and methods:   Six centres performed 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CTs during the first 3 years of its use in France. Prior to each PET/CT, the patient's data were submitted prospectively for authorisation to ANSM, the French Medicine Agency. The on-site readings of 1084 PSMA-11 PET/CTs in BCR patients whose recent FCH PET/CTs resulted negative or equivocal were pooled and analysed.  Results:   (1) The overall PR was 68%; for a median serum PSA level (sPSA) of 1.7 ng/mL, an oligometastatic pattern (1-3 foci) was observed in 31% of the cases overall; (2) PR was significantly related to sPSA (from 41% if < 0.2 ng/mL to 81% if ≥ 2 ng/mL), to patients' age, to initial therapy (64% if prostatectomy vs. 85% without prostatectomy due to frequent foci in the prostate fossa), to whether FCH PET/CT was negative or equivocal (PR = 62% vs. 82%), and to previous BCR (PR = 63% for 1st BCR vs. 72% in case of previous BCR); (3) no significant difference in PR was found according to the imaging protocol: injected activity, administration of a contrast agent and/or of furosemide, dose length product, one single or multiple time points of image acquisition; (4) no adverse event was reported after PSMA-11 injection, even associated with a contrast agent and/or furosemide.  Conclusion:   Compared with the performance of PSMA-11 PET/CT in BCR reported independently of FCH PET/CT in 6 large published series (n > 200), the selection based on FCH PET/CT resulted in no difference of PSMA-11 PR for sPSA < 1 ng/mL but in a slightly lower PR for sPSA ≥ 1 ng/mL, probably because FCH performs rather well at this sPSA and very occult BCR was over-represented in our cohort. An oligometastatic pattern paving the way to targeted therapy was observed in one fourth to one third of the cases, according to the clinico-biochemical context of the BCR. Systematic dual or triple acquisition time points or administration of a contrast agent and/or furosemide did not bring a significant added value for PSMA-11 PET/CT positivity and should be decided on individual bases.""","""['Yanna-Marina Chevalme', 'Lotfi Boudali', 'Mathieu Gauthé', 'Caroline Rousseau', 'Andrea Skanjeti', 'Charles Merlin', 'Philippe Robin', 'Anne-Laure Giraudet', 'Marc Janier', 'Jean-Noël Talbot']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Comments to ""Survey by the ANSM of the imaging protocol, detection rate, and safety of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT"".', 'Response to the letter to the Editor by Professors Francesco Giammarile and Stefano Fanti regarding our article ""Survey by the ANSM of the imaging protocol, detection rate, and safety of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT"".', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'PET/CT and biochemical recurrence of prostate adenocarcinoma: Added value of 68Ga-PSMA-11 when 18F-fluorocholine is non-contributive.', 'Head-to-Head Comparison of 18F-Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-1007 and 18F-Fluorocholine PET/CT in Biochemically Relapsed Prostate Cancer.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'The Diagnostic Performance of 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT in Prostate Cancer Patients with Early Recurrence after Definitive Therapy with a PSA <10 ng/ml.', 'Head-to-Head Comparison of 18FF-choline and Imaging of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen, Using 18FDCFPyL PET/CT, in Patients with Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer.', 'Imaging quality of an artificial intelligence denoising algorithm: validation in 68Ga PSMA-11 PET for patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.', 'Phase III Study of 18F-PSMA-1007 Versus 18F-Fluorocholine PET/CT for Localization of Prostate Cancer Biochemical Recurrence: A Prospective, Randomized, Crossover Multicenter Study.', 'The Performance of FDA-Approved PET Imaging Agents in the Detection of Prostate Cancer.', 'From radiotracer to radiopharmaceutical: a philosophical approach.']"""

Methods: SNHG3 plasmid, SNHG3 siRNA, miR-487a-3p mimic, miR-487a-3p inhibitor, TRIM25 plasmid, and TRIM25 siRNA were transfected or cotransfected into LNCaP and PC-3 cells. The proliferation, migration, and invasion of PCa cells were measured by Cell Counting Kit-8, wound-healing, and transwell assays, respectively. The expressions of SNHG3, miR-487a-3p, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Snail, and TRIM25 in PCa tissues and cells were measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or Western blot. Results: SNHG3 expression level was upregulated in PCa tissues and cells. SNHG3 overexpression and miR-487a-3p inhibitor promoted cell viability, migration, invasion, and N-cadherin and Snail levels, and inhibited E-cadherin level in LNCaP cells, while SNHG3 silencing and miR-487a-3p mimic had the opposite effects on PC-3 cells. The inhibitory effect of miR-487a-3p mimic on the migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of LNCaP cells was inversed by both SNHG3 and TRIM25 plasmids. Similarly, the function of miR-487a-3p inhibitor in PC-3 cells was also inversed by SNHG3 siRNA and TRIM25 siRNA.

Dynamic rotational motion of up to 38 degrees has been reported during prostate cancer radiotherapy, but methods to determine the dosimetric consequences of such rotations are lacking. Here, we create and experimentally validate a dose reconstruction method that accounts for dynamic rotations and translations in a commercial treatment planning system (TPS). Interplay effects are quantified by comparing dose reconstructions with dynamic and constant rotations.  Methods:   The dose reconstruction accumulates the dose in points of interest while the points are moved in six degrees of freedom (6DoF) in a precalculated time-resolved four-dimensional (4D) dose matrix to emulate dynamic motion in a patient. The required 4D dose matrix was generated by splitting the original treatment plan into multiple sub-beams, each representing 0.4 s dose delivery, and recalculating the dose of the split plan in the TPS (Eclipse). The dose accumulation was performed via TPS scripting by querying the dose of each sub-beam in dynamically moving points, allowing dose reconstruction with any dynamic motion. The dose reconstruction was validated with film dosimetry for two prostate dual arc VMAT plans with intra-prostatic lesion boosts. The plans were delivered to a pelvis phantom with internal dynamic rotational motion of a film stack (21 films with 2.5 mm separation). Each plan was delivered without motion and with three prostate motion traces. Motion-including dose reconstruction was performed for each motion experiment using the actual dynamic rotation as well as a constant rotation equal to the mean rotation during the experiment. For each experiment, the 3%/2 mm γ failure rate of the TPS dose reconstruction was calculated with the film measurement being the reference. For each motion experiment, the motion-induced 3%/2 mm γ failure rate was calculated using the static delivery as the reference and compared between film measurements and TPS dose reconstruction. DVH metrics for RT structures fully contained in the film volume were also compared between film and TPS.  Results:   The mean γ failure rate of the TPS dose reconstructions when compared to film doses was 0.8% (two static experiments) and 1.7% (six dynamic experiments). The mean (range) of the motion-induced γ failure rate in film measurements was 35.4% (21.3-59.2%). The TPS dose reconstruction agreed with these experimental γ failure rates with root-mean-square errors of 2.1% (dynamic rotation dose reconstruction) and 17.1% (dose reconstruction assuming constant rotation). By DVH metrics, the mean (range) difference between dose reconstructions with dynamic and constant rotation was 4.3% (-0.3-10.6%) (urethra D 2 % ), -0.6% (-5.6%-2.5%) (urethra D 99 % ), 1.1% (-7.1-7.7%) (GTV D 2 % ), -1.4% (-17.4-7.1%) (GTV D 95 % ), -1.2% (-17.1-5.7%) (GTV D 99 % ), and -0.1% (-3.2-7.6%) (GTV mean dose). Dose reconstructions with dynamic motion revealed large interplay effects (cold and hot spots).  Conclusions:   A method to perform dose reconstructions for dynamic 6DoF motion in a TPS was developed and experimentally validated.

MiR-501-3p has been reported to play an important role in several types of tumors, including prostate cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the biological function and potential mechanism of miR-501-3p in OS have not been well investigated until now. Here, we analyzed the expression of miR-501-3p in OS tissues and cell lines and its clinical significance in OS patients. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR showed miR-501-3p was significantly up-regulated in OS tissues and cell lines. Up-regulated miR-501-3p expression was associated with TNM stage, distal metastasis and worse prognosis in OS patients. MiR-501-3p knockdown and overexpression were achieved by miR-501-3p inhibitor and mimics transfection, respectively. CCK-8, colony formation and transwell assays showed that miR-501-3p knockdown in U2OS and Saos-2 cells suppressed, while miR-501-3p overexpression in Saos-2 cells promoted cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Moreover, luciferase reporter assay supporting BCL7A was a target of miR-501-3p and its expression was increased by miR-501-3p inhibitor, but inhibited by miR-501-3p mimics. By performing rescue experiments, we further demonstrated that BCL7A was a downstream functional regulator involved in miR-501-3p promoting OS cell functions. In summary, our findings suggest that miR-501-3p targets BCL7A may provide novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of OS.""","""['Jinliang Dai', 'Lin Lu', 'Lixin Kang', 'Jian Zhang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Hum Cell""","""['MiR-455-3p downregulation facilitates cell proliferation and invasion and predicts poor prognosis of osteosarcoma.', 'Circ-0003998 promotes cell proliferative ability and invasiveness by binding to miR-197-3p in osteosarcoma.', 'MiR-127-3p inhibits cell growth and invasiveness by targeting ITGA6 in human osteosarcoma.', 'MicroRNA-143 expression inhibits the growth and the invasion of osteosarcoma.', 'MicroRNAs and osteosarcoma: Potential targets for inhibiting metastasis and increasing chemosensitivity.', 'Mutual Regulation of ncRNAs and Chromatin Remodeling Complexes in Normal and Pathological Conditions.', 'Identification of Serum miR-501-3p and miR-338-3p as Novel Diagnostic Biomarkers for Breast Cancer and Their Target Genes Associated with Immune Infiltration.', 'A Pan-Cancer Analysis of the Oncogenic Role of BCL7B: A Potential Biomarker for Prognosis and Immunotherapy.', 'MicroRNA-501-3p inhibits the proliferation of kidney cancer cells by targeting WTAP.', 'Analysis of microRNA expression in CD133 positive cancer stem‑like cells of human osteosarcoma cell line MG-63.']"""

Methods:   A total of 70 patients treated with SBRT (total dose of 36.25 Gy) in 5 fractions were included. Hydrogel spacers were inserted in 53 patients along with gold fiducial markers. For dosimetry, we trisected the rectum on the sagittal image of magnetic resonance imaging and defined it as the upper rectum (UR), middle rectum (MR), and lower rectum (LR). We compared the dose to each part of the rectum with and without hydrogel spacer using dose volume histograms. Genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity assessments were conducted until 6 months of follow-up visits.  Results:   The median volume of the hydrogel spacer was 12.3 mL. Overall, the hydrogel spacer could significantly reduce the rectal dose in the middle-to-high-dose region (V20-V35). The rectum doses at the UR and MR were significantly lower in the spacer group in the middle to high dose region (V20-V35); the dose at the LR was significantly lower in the spacer group in the high-dose region (V30-V35).

High circ-TRPS1 expression correlated to aggressive PCa phenotypes. Knockdown of circ-TRPS1 suppressed PCa proliferation and metastasis through targeting miR-124-3p/EZH2 axis-mediated stemness in PCa, which was validated by luciferase reporter assays. EZH2 overexpression or miR-124-3p inhibition reversed the inhibition of circ-TRPS1 silencing in PCa cell migration and proliferation by recovering stemness.

Mechanistically, while both BTF3 splicing isoforms (BTF3a and BTF3b) promote cell growth, BTF3b, but not BTF3a, regulates the transcriptional expression of the genes encoding the subunits of Replication Factor C (RFC) family that is involved in DNA replication and damage repair processes. BTF3 knockdown results in decreased expression of RFC genes, and consequently attenuated DNA replication, deficient DNA damage repair, and increased G2/M arrest. Furthermore, knockdown of the RFC3 subunit diminishes the growth advantage and DNA damage repair capability conferred by ectopic overexpression of BTF3b. Importantly, we show that enforced BTF3 overexpression in prostate cancer cells induces substantial accumulation of cisplatin-DNA adducts and render the cells more sensitive to cisplatin treatment both in vitro and in vivo.

However, how this histone modifier affects the progression of prostate cancer (PCa) is still unknown. Here we analyzed sequenced gene expression data and tissue microarray to explore the expression features and prognostic value of KDM6B in PCa. Further, we performed in vitro cell biological experiments and in vivo nude mouse models to reveal the biological function, upstream and downstream regulation mechanism of KDM6B. In addition, we investigated the effects of a KDM6B inhibitor, GSK-J4, on PCa cells. We showed that KDM6B overexpression was observed in PCa, and elevated KDM6B expression was associated with high Gleason Score, low serum prostate-specific antigen level and shorted recurrence-free survival. Moreover, KDM6B prompted proliferation, migration, invasion and cell cycle progression and suppressed apoptosis in PCa cells. GSK-J4 administration could significantly suppress the biological function of KDM6B in PCa cells. KDM6B is involved in the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and combination of MDV3100 plus GSK-J4 is effective for CRPC and MDV3100-resistant CRPC. Mechanism exploration revealed that androgen receptor can decrease the transcription of KDM6B and that KDM6B demethylates H3K27me3 at the cyclin D1 promoter and cooperates with smad2/3 to prompt the expression of cyclin D1.

CAR-T is expensive partly due to the restricted use of each CAR construct for specific tumors. Thus, a CAR construct with broad antitumor activity can be advantageous. We identified that CD126 is expressed by many hematologic and solid tumors, including multiple myeloma, lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia, pancreatic and prostate adenocarcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and malignant melanoma among others. CAR-T cells targeting CD126 were generated and shown to kill many tumor cells in an antigen-specific manner and with efficiency directly proportional to CD126 expression. Soluble CD126 did not interfere with CAR-T cell killing. The CAR-T constructs bind murine CD126 but caused no weight loss or hepatotoxicity in mice. In multiple myeloma and prostate adenocarcinoma xenograft models, intravenously injected CD126 CAR-T cells infiltrated within, expanded, and killed tumor cells without toxicity.

Optimal exploitation of DDR defects in prostate cancer requires new diagnostic strategies and a better understanding of associated clinical genomic features.  Experimental design:   We performed targeted sequencing of 1,615 plasma cell-free DNA samples from 879 patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Depth-based copy-number calls and heterozygous SNP imbalance were leveraged to expose DDR-mutant allelic configuration and categorize mechanisms of biallelic loss. We used split-read structural variation analysis to characterize tumor suppressor rearrangements. Patient-matched archival primary tissue was analyzed identically.  Results: BRCA2, ATM, and CDK12 were the most frequently disrupted DDR genes in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), collectively mutated in 15% of evaluable cases. Biallelic gene disruption via second somatic alteration or mutant allele-specific imbalance was identified in 79% of patients. A further 2% exhibited homozygous BRCA2 deletions. Tumor suppressors TP53, RB1, and PTEN were controlled via disruptive chromosomal rearrangements in BRCA2-defective samples, but via oncogene amplification in context of CDK12 defects. TP53 mutations were rare in cases with ATM defects. DDR mutations were re-detected across 94% of serial ctDNA samples and in all available archival primary tissues, indicating they arose prior to metastatic progression. Loss of BRCA2 and CDK12, but not ATM, was associated with poor clinical outcomes.  Conclusions: BRCA2, ATM, and CDK12 defects are each linked to distinct prostate cancer driver genomics and aggression. The consistency of DDR status in longitudinal samples and resolution of allelic status underscores the potential for ctDNA as a diagnostic tool.""","""['Evan Warner#', 'Cameron Herberts#', 'Simon Fu', 'Steven Yip', 'Amanda Wong', 'Gang Wang', 'Elie Ritch', 'Andrew J Murtha', 'Gillian Vandekerkhove', 'Nicolette M Fonseca', 'Arkhjamil Angeles', 'Arshia Beigi', 'Elena Schönlau', 'Kevin Beja', 'Matti Annala', 'Daniel Khalaf', 'Kim N Chi', 'Alexander W Wyatt']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Clinical and genomic insights into circulating tumor DNA-based alterations across the spectrum of metastatic hormone-sensitive and castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Concordance of Circulating Tumor DNA and Matched Metastatic Tissue Biopsy in Prostate Cancer.', 'Distinct Response to Platinum-Based Chemotherapy among Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Harboring Alterations in Genes Involved in Homologous Recombination.', 'Circulating Tumor DNA Testing for Homology Recombination Repair Genes in Prostate Cancer: From the Lab to the Clinic.', 'DNA Repair Deficiency Is Common in Advanced Prostate Cancer: New Therapeutic Opportunities.', 'Cell-free DNA in the management of prostate cancer: Current status and future prospective.', 'A generalizable machine learning framework for classifying DNA repair defects using ctDNA exomes.', 'DNA repair deficiency as circulating biomarker in prostate cancer.', 'Heterogeneity of 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: genomic characteristics and association with abiraterone response.', 'Plasma cell subtypes analyzed using artificial intelligence algorithm for predicting biochemical recurrence, immune escape potential, and immunotherapy response of prostate cancer.']"""

To circumvent these issues, we made EV-mimicking nanovesicles from standardized MSCs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with a theoretically limitless expandability, and examined the targeting capacity of these nanovesicles to prostate cancer.  Methods:   Nanovesicles are made from intact iPSC-MSCs through serial extrusion. The selective uptake of fluorescently labeled nanovesicles by prostate cancer cells vs. non-tumor cells was examined with flow cytometry. For in vivo tracing, nanovesicles were labeled with fluorescent dye DiR or renilla luciferase. In mice carrying subcutaneous or bone metastatic PC3 prostate cancer, the biodistribution of systemically infused nanovesicles was examined with in vivo and ex vivo imaging of DiR and luminescent signals. A chemotherapeutic drug, docetaxel, was loaded into nanovesicles during extrusion. The cytotoxicities of nanovesicle-encapsulated docetaxel on docetaxel-sensitive and -resistant prostate cancer cells and non-tumor cells were examined in comparison with free docetaxel. Therapeutic effects of nanovesicle-encapsulated docetaxel were examined in mice carrying subcutaneous or bone metastatic prostate cancer by monitoring tumor growth in comparison with free docetaxel.  Results:   iPSC-MSC nanovesicles are more selectively taken up by prostate cancer cells vs. non-tumor cells in vitro compared with EVs, membrane-only EV-mimetic nanoghosts and liposomes, which is not affected by storage for up to 6 weeks. In mouse models of subcutaneous and bone metastatic PC3 prostate cancer, systemically infused nanovesicles accumulate in tumor regions with significantly higher selectivity than liposomes. The loading of docetaxel into nanovesicles was efficient and did not affect the selective uptake of nanovesicles by prostate cancer cells. The cytotoxicities of nanovesicle-encapsulated docetaxel are significantly stronger on docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells and weaker on non-tumor cells than free docetaxel. In mouse models of subcutaneous and bone metastatic prostate cancer, nanovesicle-encapsulated docetaxel significantly decreased the tumor growth and toxicity to white blood cells compared with free docetaxel.

We aimed to assess the effects of perceived social support, hope and resilience on depressive symptoms within 18 months after diagnosis of PCa, and to evaluate the role of hope and resilience as mediators of that relationship.  Method:   A cross-sectional study was analyzed in consecutive inpatients with PCa during the months of January 2018 and August 2019. A total of 667 patients eligible for this study completed questionnaires on demographic and clinic variables, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, Adult Hope Scale, and Resilience Scale (14 items). All registered patients were all volunteers and anonymous. Depressive symptoms, perceived social support, hope and resilience were measured anonymously. Out of 667 patients, a total of 564 effective respondents (< 30% missing data) became our subjects. Hierarchical linear regression was used to identify the factors associated with depressive symptoms. Asymptotic and resampling strategies were used to conduct the mediating effects of hope and resilience.  Results:   The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 65.9% in PCa patients. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that perceived social support, hope, and resilience together accounted for 27.5% variance of depressive symptoms. Support from family, hope, and resilience significantly associated with depressive symptoms, respectively. Hope (a*b = - 0.0783, BCa95% CI: - 0.134 to - 0.0319, p < 0.05), and resilience (a*b = - 0.1315, BCa95% CI: - 0.1894 to - 0.0783, p < 0.05) significantly mediated the association between perceived social support and depressive symptoms.  Conclusions:   The high prevalence of depressive symptoms among PCa patients should receive more attention. Perceived social support, hope and resilience could be positive resources for combating depressive symptoms, and hope and resilience mediated the association between perceived social support and depressive symptoms. Enhancing social support, particularly the support form family, and improving patients' outlook and resilience may be potential targets for future psychosocial interventions aimed at reducing depressive symptoms.""","""['Xinxin Zhao', 'Ming Sun', 'Ye Yang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Health Qual Life Outcomes""","""['Effective resources for improving mental health among Chinese underground coal miners: perceived organizational support and psychological capital.', 'Associations of psychological distress with positive psychological variables and activities of daily living among stroke patients: a cross-sectional study.', 'Prevalence and its associated psychological variables of symptoms of depression and anxiety among ovarian cancer patients in China: a cross-sectional study.', 'Resilience and related factors in colorectal cancer patients: A systematic review.', 'Hope and work: From the pandemic to possibility, purpose, and resilience.', 'Anxiety, depression, and sleep quality among breast cancer patients in North China: Mediating roles of hope and medical social support.', 'Factors influencing resilience in patients with advanced cancer: A cross-sectional study.', 'Effect of caregiver burden on anticipatory grief among caregivers of elderly cancer patients: Chain mediation role of family functioning and resilience.', 'Indirect effects of social support and hope on quality of life via emotional distress among stroke survivors: A three-wave structural equation model.', 'Hope and depression: the mediating role of social support and spiritual coping in advanced cancer patients.']"""

High levels of PSA and NSE were observed, and prostate biopsy revealed an adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation. Multiple metastases to the lymph nodes, bones, and liver were identified, and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) was started immediately. Following 2 weeks of treatment, erythema on the skin, and muscle weakness with severe dysphagia appeared. The patient was diagnosed with dermatomyositis, and high-dose glucocorticoid therapy was initiated.

Methods:   To conduct the cost-effectiveness analysis, a Markov decision model was established. Three health states (progression-free survival (PFS), progressive disease (PD) and death) were included, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was regarded as the primary endpoint. The willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was set at $100,000.00/quality-adjusted life year (QALY), and discounted rates were set at 3% annually. Efficacy data were derived from the CARD trial and Weibull distribution curves were modeled to fit the survival curves. The robustness of the analysis was tested with a series of one-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.  Results:   Overall, the incremental effectiveness and cost of cabazitaxel versus androgen-signaling-targeted inhibitors (ASTIs) were 0.16 QALYs and $49,487.03, respectively, which yielded an ICER of $309,293.94/QALY. Our model was mostly sensitive to the duration of PFS in the cabazitaxel group, cost of cabazitaxel and utility of the PFS state. At a WTP threshold of $100,000.00/QALY, cabazitaxel was the dominant strategy in 0% of the simulations.

The present research work investigated the anticancer activity of phytosynthesized SNPs against human cancer cell lines. Phytosynthesis of SNPs was achieved by using an aqueous extract of Salacia chinensis (SC) bark as a green source to reduce silver nitrate to silver nanoparticles. Characterization of synthesized nanoparticles demonstrated a UV-visible peak at 443 nm, ζ-potential (zetasizer) of -25.6 ± 0.34 and particle size (transmission electron microscopy analysis) in the range of 40-80 nm, which validates formation of stable silver nanoparticles. The absence of cytotoxicity against normal human fibroblasts and blood erythrocytes confirms the biocompatible nature of green synthesized SNPs. In vitro anticancer assay demonstrated IC50 values of 6.31, 4.002, 5.228, 8.452, 14.37, 7.46, and 6.55 μg/mL against liver (Hep G2), lungs (L-132), pancreas (MIA-Pa-Ca-2), breast (MDA-MB-231), oral (KB cells), prostate (PC-3), and cervical (HeLa) cancer cell lines respectively, which confirms its potent anticancer action.

According to the literature, patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD) or stroke (ST) show adverse continence outcomes after prostate surgery and, therefore, constitute a challenging cohort for continence surgery. However, little is known with respect to the results of AUS surgery in these patients. A retrospective analysis of our institutional, prospectively maintained AUS database aims to address this aspect with a focus on surgical and functional outcomes.  Methods and patients:   All data of patients with an AUS implantation were prospectively collected in our database since 2009. The AUS was implanted according to a standardized protocol and activated at 6 weeks postoperatively at our institution. Further follow-up (FU) consisted of pad-test, uroflowmetry, residual urine, and radiography as well as a standardized questionnaire including the Incontinence Quality of Life questionnaire (I-Quol) and International Consultation on Incontinence questionnaire (ICIQ-SF) and is scheduled at 6 and 24 months and every 2 years thereafter. Patients received a preoperative urodynamic evaluation (UD). Patients with normal voiding and storage function were considered for AUS implantation. All patients performed a preoperative test for manual dexterity. Patients with a history of ST or PD were grouped and compared to nonneurological patients. Primary/secondary endpoints of the study were complications/continence.  Results:   234 patients were available for analysis. The median FU was 24 months (interquartile range 7-36). Twenty-four patients (10%) had a neurological history (PD and ST). Neurological patients showed significantly worse outcomes regarding continence (objective/subjective/social continence; p = 0.04/p = 0.02/p = 0.1). Significant differences concerning explantation rates were not observed (p = 1). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed no significant difference regarding explantation-free survival (log-rank p = 0.53).  Conclusion:   AUS implantation shows significantly worse continence rates for neurological patients, despite the fact that all patients showed normal UD results and sufficient manual dexterity.

However, long-term oncological results are awaited and there is no consensus on follow-up strategies. Molecular biomarkers (MB) may be useful in selecting, treating and following up men undergoing FT, though there is limited evidence in this field to guide practice. We aimed to conduct a consensus meeting, endorsed by the Focal Therapy Society, amongst a large group of experts, to understand the potential utility of MB in FT for localized PCa.  Methods:   A 38-item questionnaire was built following a literature search. The authors then performed three rounds of a Delphi Consensus using DelphiManager, using the GRADE grid scoring system, followed by a face-to-face expert meeting. Three areas of interest were identified and covered concerning MB for FT, 1) the current/present role; 2) the potential/future role; 3) the recommended features for future studies. Consensus was defined using a 70% agreement threshold.  Results:   Of 95 invited experts, 42 (44.2%) completed the three Delphi rounds. Twenty-four items reached a consensus and they were then approved at the meeting involving (N.=15) experts. Fourteen items reached a consensus on uncertainty, or they did not reach a consensus. They were re-discussed, resulting in a consensus (N.=3), a consensus on a partial agreement (N.=1), and a consensus on uncertainty (N.=10).

Methods:   Pros-IT CNR is an ongoing, longitudinal and observational study, considering a convenience sample of patients enrolled at PCa diagnosis and followed at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months from the diagnosis. Patients were grouped according to the treatment received: nerve sparing radical prostatectomy (NSRP), non-nerve sparing radical prostatectomy (NNSRP), radiotherapy (RT), RT plus androgen deprivation (RT plus ADT) and active surveillance (AS). QoL was measured through the Italian versions of SF-12 and UCLA-PCI questionnaires at diagnosis and at 6-12 and 24-month. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was defined as half a standard deviation of the baseline domain.  Results:   Overall, 1537 patients were included in the study.

However, the cost-effectiveness of this treatment remains unaddressed.  Objective:   To assess the cost-effectiveness of PRT when added to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for men with low-volume metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC).  Design, setting, and participants:   This economic evaluation used microsimulation modeling to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adding PRT to ADT. A simulated cohort of 10 000 individuals with low-volume mHSPC was created. Data from men with low-volume mHSPC were extracted and analyzed from January 18, 2019, through July 4, 2020. Transition probabilities were extracted from the STAMPEDE-H study. Health states included stable disease, progression, second progression, and death. Individual grade 2 or higher genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxic events associated with PRT were tracked. Univariable deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses explored uncertainty with regard to the model assumptions. Health state utility estimates were based on the published literature.  Exposures:   The combination of PRT and ADT using regimens of 20 fractions and 6 weekly fractions.  Main outcomes and measures:   Outcomes included net quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs in US dollars, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. A strategy was classified as dominant if it was associated with higher QALYs at lower costs than the alternative and dominated if it was associated with fewer QALYs at higher costs than the alternative.  Results:   For the base case scenario of men 68 years of age with low-volume mHSPC, the modeled outcomes were similar to the target clinical data for overall survival, failure-free survival, and rates of PRT-related toxic effects. The addition of PRT was a dominant strategy compared with ADT alone, with a gain of 0.16 QALYs (95% CI, 0.15-0.17 QALYs) and a reduction in net costs by $19 472 (95% CI, $23 096-$37 362) at 37 months of follow-up and a gain of 0.81 QALYs (95% CI, 0.73-0.89 QALYs) and savings of $30 229 (95% CI, $23 096-$37 362) with lifetime follow-up.  Conclusions and relevance:   In the economic evaluation, PRT was a dominant treatment strategy compared with ADT alone. These findings suggest that addition of PRT to ADT is a cost-effective treatment for men with low-volume mHSPC.""","""['Nataniel H Lester-Coll', 'Steven Ades', 'James B Yu', 'Adam Atherly', 'H James Wallace rd', 'Brian L Sprague']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Errors in Abstract and Main Results.', 'Survival modelling and cost-effectiveness analysis of treatments for newly diagnosed metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Decision analytic cost-effectiveness model to compare prostate cryotherapy to androgen deprivation therapy for treatment of radiation recurrent prostate cancer.', 'A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Systemic Therapy for Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer.', 'Adding abiraterone to androgen deprivation therapy in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: A\xa0systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Hormone naïve metastatic prostate cancer: How to treat it?', 'Radiotherapy in Oligometastatic, Oligorecurrent and Oligoprogressive Prostate Cancer: A Mini-Review.', 'Errors in Abstract and Main Results.']"""

Methods:   Three brachytherapy sources (125I, 192Ir, and 169Yb) were modelled in Geant4 Monte Carlo code, and the resulting electron energy spectrum in water in 3D space around these sources was scored (voxel size of 2 mm3). With this energy spectrum, microdosimetric techniques were used to calculate the maximum RBE, RBEM, as a function of distance from the source. RBEM of 125I relative to 192Ir was calculated in order to validate simulations against literature; all other RBEM calculations were done by normalizing electron fluence at various distances to the source position. In order to examine the impact of RBEM variation in treatment planning, a realistic 192Ir prostate plan was re-evaluated in terms of RBE instead of absorbed dose.  Results:   The RBEM of 125I, 192Ir, and 169Yb at 8 cm away from the source was 0.994 (+/-0.002), 1.030 (+/-0.003), and 1.066 (+/-0.008), respectively. RBEM in the HDR prostate treatment plan exhibited several hot (+3.6% in RBEM) spots.  Conclusions:   The large increase RBEM observed in 169Yb has not yet been described in the literature.

In the market it was found that many pharmacological drugs containing the pyran and pyridine nucleus that were produced through MCR's were found.  Objective:   This work aims to synthesize target molecules not only possess anti-tumour activities but also c-Met and prostate cancer inhibitors. The target molecules were obtained starting from cyclohexan-1,3-dione through its multi-component reactions to produce anticancer target molecules.  Methods:   Cyclohexane-1,3-dione underwent different multi-component reactions to produce fused pyran, pyridine and thiophene derivatives. The anti-proliferative activity of the newly synthesized compounds among the synthesized compounds toward the six cancer cell lines, namely A549, H460, HT-29, MKN-45, U87MG, and SMMC-7721 was studied. In addition, inhibitions toward c-Met kinase and prostate cancer cell line were studied. Antitumor evaluations toward seventeen cancer cell lines subpanel, for certain compounds, were also demonstrated according to the diseases. Pim-1 kinase inhibitions of the most active compounds were also measured.  Results:   Anti-proliferative evaluations, c-Met and Pim-1 kinase inhibitions were performed for most of the synthesized compounds where the varieties of substituent through the aryl ring and the heterocyclic ring afforded compounds with high activities.

After, cell viability and proliferation, oxidative metabolism, colony formation and cell cycle analyses were performed. Also, we exposed the African green monkey kidney cell line (VERO) to the same lemongrass concentrations to investigate a possible toxicity of this extract.  Results:   Our findings suggested that lemongrass presented an antitumor effect and improved docetaxel chemotherapy activity by decreasing cell viability and proliferation as well as colony formation. Moreover, we found an oxidative stress increased and cell cycle arresting in G0 /G1 phase. In addition, this extract presented selectivity action for cancer cells, since it did not cause cytotoxicity in normal cells, ensuring non-toxic therapeutic concentrations.

Our study aimed to explore age-related genes, cells, and biological changes in three common urogenital cancers via integrative bioinformatics analysis. First, mRNA (count format) and clinical data for bladder cancer, prostate cancer and renal cell carcinoma were downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Through the comparison of clinicopathological characteristics, genes expression and cells infiltration between the old group and the young group, it was found that the clinical characteristics, genes and cells in the tumor microenvironment of different ages were quite different. And 4 key cells, 14 hub genes and some potential pathways were identified and considered as important factors. More importantly, we analyzed the differential landscape of the genes and cells from different perspectives, and confirmed its importance. In conclusion, we identified genes and cell types associated with age-related changes in the tumour microenvironment in urogenital cancer patients. These genes and cell types may play a critical role in the age-associated differences in clinicopathological characteristics among urogenital cancers, thus providing a link between ageing and cancer occurrence.

However, its involvement in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains unclear. We demonstrated that EPHA10 supports in vivo tumor growth and lymphatic metastasis of OSCC cells. OSCC cell migration, epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), and sphere formation were found to be regulated by EPHA10, and EPHA10 was found to drive expression of some EMT- and stemness-associated transcription factors. Among EPHA10 ligands, exogenous ephrin A4 (EFNA4) induced the most OSCC cell migration and sphere formation, as well as up-regulation of SNAIL, NANOG, and OCT4. These effects were abolished by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibition and NANOG knockdown.

A standardized and idealized two-dimensional CFD model after transurethral surgery (CATS-1st) was developed for post-surgery mid-voiding. Using CATS-1st, 210 examples were amplified according to an array of size [3][5][14], which contained three groups of longitudinal diameters of prostatic urethra (LD-PU). Each of these groups contained five subgroups of transverse diameters of the bladder neck (TD-BN), each with 14 examples of transverse diameters of PU (TD-PU). The pressure and velocity of urine flow were monitored through flow dynamics simulation, and the relationship among RPU-1 (TD-PU/TD-BN), RPU-2 (RPU-1/LD-PU), the transverse diameter of the vortex, and the midpoint velocity of the external urethral orifice (MV-EUO) was determined. A total of 210 CATS examples, including CATS-1st examples, were analyzed. High (bladder and PU) and medium/low (the rest of the urethra) pressure zones, and low (bladder), medium (PU), and high (the rest of the urethra) velocity zones were determined. The rapid changes in the velocity were concentrated in and around the PU. Laminar flow was present in all the examples. The vortices appeared and then gradually shrank with reducing RPU on both the sides of PU in 182 examples. In the vortex examples, minimum RPU-1 and RPU-2 reached close to the values of 0.79 and 0.02, respectively. MV-EUO increased gradually with decreasing RPU. In comparison to the vortex examples, the non-vortex examples exhibited a significantly higher (p < 0.01) MV-EUO. The developed CFD models (CATS) presented an effective simulation of urine flow behavior within the PU after transurethral surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). These models could prove to be useful for morphological repair in PU after transurethral surgery.""","""['Bin Zhang', 'Shuang Liu', 'Yinxia Liu', 'Bo Wu', 'Xuhui Zhang', 'Xin Wang', 'Xuezhi Liang', 'Xiaoming Cao', 'Dongwen Wang', 'Chin-Lee Wu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Numerical investigation of urethra flow characteristics in benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Minimally invasive prostatic urethral lift: surgical technique and multinational experience.', 'Incidence of the form and caliber of urethral resistance.

However, recent reports on robotic sRP show improved results. Our objectives were to evaluate sRP oncological outcomes and predictors of positive margins and biochemical recurrence (BCR).  Methods:   We retrospectively collected data of sRP for recurrent prostate cancer after local nonsurgical treatment at 18 tertiary referral centers in United States, Australia and Europe, from 2000 to 2016. SM and BCR were evaluated in a univariate and multivariable analysis. Overall and cancer-specific survival were also assessed.  Results:   We included 414 cases, 63.5% of them performed after radiotherapy. Before sRP the majority of patients had biopsy Gleason score (GS) ≤7 (55.5%) and imaging negative or with prostatic bed involvement only (93.3%). Final pathology showed aggressive histology in 39.7% (GS ≥9 27.6%), with 52.9% having ≥pT3 disease and 16% pN+. SM was positive in 29.7%. Five years BCR-Free, cancer-specific survival and OS were 56.7%, 97.7% and 92.1%, respectively. On multivariable analysis pathological T (pT3a odds ratio [OR] 2.939, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.469-5.879; ≥pT3b OR 2.428-95% CI 1.333-4.423) and N stage (pN1 OR 2.871, 95% CI 1.503-5.897) were independent predictors of positive margins. Pathological T stage ≥T3b (OR 2.348 95% CI 1.338-4.117) and GS (up to OR 7.183, 95% CI 1.906-27.068 for GS >8) were independent predictors for BCR. Limitations include the retrospective nature of the study and limited follow-up.  Conclusions:   In a contemporary series, sRP showed promising oncological control in the medium term despite aggressive pathological features. BCR risk increased in case of locally advanced disease and higher GS.

Previous studies have had inadequate power to estimate variant effect sizes.  Objective:   To precisely estimate the contribution of germline ATM mutations to PrCa risk.  Design, setting, and participants:   We analysed next-generation sequencing data from 13 PRACTICAL study groups comprising 5560 cases and 3353 controls of European ancestry.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Variant Call Format files were harmonised, annotated for rare ATM variants, and classified as tier 1 (likely pathogenic) or tier 2 (potentially deleterious). Associations with overall PrCa risk and clinical subtypes were estimated.  Results and limitations:   PrCa risk was higher in carriers of a tier 1 germline ATM variant, with an overall odds ratio (OR) of 4.4 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.0-9.5). There was also evidence that PrCa cases with younger age at diagnosis (<65 yr) had elevated tier 1 variant frequencies (pdifference = 0.04). Tier 2 variants were also associated with PrCa risk, with an OR of 1.4 (95% CI: 1.1-1.7).  Conclusions:   Carriers of pathogenic ATM variants have an elevated risk of developing PrCa and are at an increased risk for earlier-onset disease presentation. These results provide information for counselling of men and their families.  Patient summary:   In this study, we estimated that men who inherit a likely pathogenic mutation in the ATM gene had an approximately a fourfold risk of developing prostate cancer.

However, the implementation of formal SDM programs in routine care remains limited, and implementation outcomes for disadvantaged populations are especially poorly described. We describe the implementation outcomes between academic and county health care settings.  Methods:   We administered a decision aid (DA) for men with localized prostate cancer at an academic center and across a county health care system. Our implementation was guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework. We assessed the effectiveness of the DA through a postappointment patient survey.  Results:   Sites differed by patient demographic/clinical characteristics. Reach (DA invitation rate) was similar and insensitive to implementation strategies at the academic center and county (66% v. 60%, P = 0.37). Fidelity (DA completion rate) was also similar at the academic center and county (77% v. 80%, P = 0.74). DA effectiveness was similar between sites, except for higher academic center ratings for net promoter for the doctor (77% v. 37%, P = 0.01) and the health care system (77% v. 35%, P = 0.006) and greater satisfaction with manner of care (medians 100 v. 87.5, P = 0.04). Implementation strategies (e.g., faxing of patients' records and meeting patients in the clinic to complete the DA) represented substantial practice changes at both sites. The completion rate increased following the onset of reminder calls at the academic center and the creation of a Spanish module at the county.  Conclusions:   Successful DA implementation efforts should focus on patient engagement and access.

In this study, we identify 24 types of first primary malignancies (FPMs) between 2004 and 2015 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Patients in the radiotherapy group were matched to those in the no radiotherapy group with a matching ratio of 1:1. After propensity-score matching (PSM), additional competing risk regression analyses were performed to calculate the efficacy of radiotherapy to SPMs in the PSM-adjusted population. In addition, the Fine and Gray model was utilized in the primary cohorts, and stratified analyses were performed based on surgery. This study includes a total of 2,831,789 eligible patients with tumors diagnosed from 2004 to 2015 in the SEER 18 database, amongst whom 100,194 (3.5%) patients developed SPMs. We observe higher risks of SPMs associated with radiotherapy in several types of tumors in the PSM-adjusted populations (small bowel adenocarcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma, urinary bladder transitional cell carcinoma, invasive ductal breast carcinoma, invasive lobular breast carcinoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma). The results in the PSM-adjusted populations were consistent with outcomes in the multivariable competing risk models. Meanwhile, in subgroup analyses stratified by surgery, some other types of tumor (except for those with positive results in the PSM-adjusted cohorts) with radiotherapy were also associated with a higher prevalence of SPMs in the subgroups of surgical treatment (pancreatic adenocarcinoma, rectal adenocarcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma and follicular thyroid carcinoma in the surgery subgroups). The impact of radiotherapy on the incidence of secondary malignancies is distinct in different types of cancer.

This was a prospective cohort validating study to access the clinical accuracy of systematic and MRI-cognitive targeted transperineal prostate biopsies in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer after a previous negative biopsy and persistent suspicion of malignancy. The primary goal was to assess the ability of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) to detect clinically significant prostate cancer with an additional goal to assess the diagnostic value of systematic and MRI-cognitive transperineal biopsies. Materials and Methods: In total, 200 patients were enrolled who had rising serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels for at least 4 months after a previous negative transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy. All eligible men underwent 1.5T prostate mpMRI, reported using the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2 (PI-RADS v2), followed by a 20-region transperineal prostate systematic biopsy and additional targeted biopsies. Results: Systematic 20-core transperineal prostate biopsies (TPBs) were performed for 38 (19%) patients. Systemic 20-core TPB with additional cognitive targeted biopsies were performed for 162 (81%) patients. Clinically significant prostate cancer (csPC) was detected for 31 (15.5%) patients, of which 20 (64.5%) cases of csPC were detected by systematic biopsy, eight (25.8%) cases were detected by targeted biopsy, and three (9.7%) both by systematic and targeted biopsies.

Materials and Methods: PSMA I&T was labeled with 64Cu, and stability in human and mouse sera was evaluated. Prostate cancer cell lines were used for specific uptake assays (22RV1 for PSMA-positive, PC-3 for -negative). Both PC-3 and 22RV1 cells were transplanted into the left and right thighs in a mouse for PET/computed tomography (CT) imaging. Biodistribution was performed using 22RV1 tumor models. Results: Labeling yield (decay corrected) of 64Cu-PSMA I&T was more than 95% compared to the free 64Cu peak. The serum stability of 64Cu-PSMA I&T was maintained at more than 90% until 60 h. Regarding the specific binding of 64Cu-PSMA I&T was 7.5-fold higher to 22RV1 cells than PC-3 cells (p < 0.001). On PET/CT imaging, more specific 64Cu-PSMA I&T uptake was observed to 22RV1 tumors than to PC-3 tumors. In the PSMA blocking study using 2-phosphonomethoxypropyl adenine (2-PMPA), the 64Cu-PSMA I&T signal significantly decreased in the 22RV1 tumor region. In the biodistribution study, the kidney uptake was the highest among all organs at 2 h (52.6 ± 20.8%ID/g) but sharply decreased at 24 and 48 h. Also, the liver showed similar uptake over time (range, 10-12%ID/g). On the contrary, 64Cu-PSMA I&T uptake of the tumors increased with time and peaked at 48 h (5.6 ± 0.1%ID/g). Conclusions: PSMA I&T labeled with 64Cu showed the feasibility of the PSMA specific PET imaging through in vitro and in vivo studies. Furthermore, 64Cu-PSMA I&T might be considered as the candidate of future clinical trial.""","""['Chul-Hee Lee', 'Ilhan Lim', 'Sang-Keun Woo', 'Kwang Il Kim', 'Kyo Chul Lee', 'Kanghyon Song', 'Chang Woon Choi', 'Sang Moo Lim']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Biother Radiopharm""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Preclinical Evaluation and Pilot Clinical Study of Al18F-PSMA-BCH for Prostate Cancer PET Imaging.', 'Development of Novel PSMA Ligands for Imaging and Therapy with Copper Isotopes.', 'PET/CT With 68Ga-PSMA in Prostate Cancer: Radiopharmaceutical Background and Clinical Implications.', 'Can Negative Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Avoid the Need for Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection in Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer Patients?

The Cu-1/2 metalated peptides were synthesized by reacting 1/2 with CuCl2 and were characterized by LC-ESI-MS and HR-ESI-MS. Cu-1/2 exhibited high GRPR-binding affinities with IC50 values <3 nM, as measured in a competition assay using the GRPR-expressing human PC-3 prostate cancer cell line and [125I]I-Tyr4-BBN as the competing ligand. Tracers [64Cu]Cu-1/2 were prepared in quantitative radiochemical yield (by radio-HPLC), and their identities were confirmed by coelution with their Cu-1/2 standards via comparative HPLC studies. Lipophilicity was measured in 1-octanol/PBS (pH 7.4), and the negative log D7.4 values (≤-1) confirmed the anticipated hydrophilic character for [64Cu]Cu-1/2. Both tracers demonstrated excellent in vitro stability, with ≥98% remaining intact through 24 h at physiological conditions (PBS, pH 7.4, 37 °C). Biodistribution in PC-3 tumor-bearing mice demonstrated good tumor uptake (%ID/g at 4 h: 4.34 ± 0.71 for [64Cu]Cu-1, 3.92 ± 1.03 for [64Cu]Cu-2) and rapid renal clearance (≥87% ID at 4 h).

Compared with the corresponding non-targeted probe (Ce6@PDA-PEG-PFP), our targeted probe induced higher cellular uptake in vitro (6.5-fold) and more tumor accumulation in vivo (4.6-fold), suggesting strong active targeting capacity. Meanwhile, this new nanoplatform significantly enhanced the ultrasound contrast signal at the tumor site in vivo, thus facilitating precise and real-time detection of the tumor. In addition, this Ce6-loaded PDA nanoplatform produced a synergistic effect of PDT and PTT under 660 nm and 808 nm irradiation, inducing a more efficient killing effect compared with the individual therapy in vitro and in vivo.

Incidence data (through 2017) were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program; the National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data (through 2018) were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2021, 1,898,160 new cancer cases and 608,570 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. After increasing for most of the 20th century, the cancer death rate has fallen continuously from its peak in 1991 through 2018, for a total decline of 31%, because of reductions in smoking and improvements in early detection and treatment. This translates to 3.2 million fewer cancer deaths than would have occurred if peak rates had persisted. Long-term declines in mortality for the 4 leading cancers have halted for prostate cancer and slowed for breast and colorectal cancers, but accelerated for lung cancer, which accounted for almost one-half of the total mortality decline from 2014 to 2018. The pace of the annual decline in lung cancer mortality doubled from 3.1% during 2009 through 2013 to 5.5% during 2014 through 2018 in men, from 1.8% to 4.4% in women, and from 2.4% to 5% overall. This trend coincides with steady declines in incidence (2.2%-2.3%) but rapid gains in survival specifically for nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). For example, NSCLC 2-year relative survival increased from 34% for persons diagnosed during 2009 through 2010 to 42% during 2015 through 2016, including absolute increases of 5% to 6% for every stage of diagnosis; survival for small cell lung cancer remained at 14% to 15%.

Though, estrogenicity is the most studied behavior of EDCs, the androgenic potential of most of the EDCs remains elusive. This study investigates the androgen mimicking potential of some common EDCs and their effect in androgen-dependent prostate cancer (LNCaP) cells. Based on the In silico interaction study, all the 8 EDCs tested were found to interact with androgen receptor with different binding energies. Further, the luciferase reporter activity confirmed the androgen mimicking potential of 4 EDCs namely benzo[a]pyrene, dichlorvos, genistein and β-endosulfan. Whereas, aldrin, malathion, tebuconazole and DDT were reported as antiandrogenic in luciferase reporter activity assay. Next, the nanomolar concentration of androgen mimicking EDCs (benzo[a]pyrene, dichlorvos, genistein and β-endosulfan) significantly enhanced the expression of AR protein and subsequent nuclear translocation in LNCaP cells. Our In silico studies further demonstrated that androgenic EDCs also bind with epigenetic regulatory enzymes namely DNMT1 and HDAC1. Moreover, exposure to these EDCs enhanced the protein expression of DNMT1 and HDAC1 in LNCaP cells. These observations suggest that EDCs may regulate proliferation in androgen sensitive LNCaP cells by acting as androgen mimicking ligands for AR signaling as well as by regulating epigenetic machinery.

We demonstrated the potential feasibility of this idea in prostate cancer intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Despite the success, the process to train a VTPN via the standard DRL approach with an ϵ-greedy algorithm was time-consuming. The required training time was expected to grow with the complexity of the treatment planning problem, preventing the development of VTPN for more complicated but clinically relevant scenarios. In this study, we proposed a novel knowledge-guided DRL (KgDRL) approach that incorporated knowledge from human planners to guide the training process to improve the efficiency of training a VTPN.  Method:   Using prostate cancer IMRT as a test bed, we first summarized a number of rules in the actions of adjusting treatment planning parameters of our in-house TPS. During the training process of VTPN, in addition to randomly navigating the large state-action space, as in the standard DRL approach using the ϵ-greedy algorithm, we also sampled actions defined by the rules. The priority of sampling actions from rules decreased over the training process to encourage VTPN to explore new policy on parameter adjustment that were not covered by the rules. To test this idea, we trained a VTPN using KgDRL and compared its performance with another VTPN trained using the standard DRL approach. Both networks were trained using 10 training patient cases and five additional cases for validation, while another 59 cases were employed for the evaluation purpose.  Results:   It was found that both VTPNs trained via KgDRL and standard DRL spontaneously learned how to operate the in-house TPS to generate high-quality plans, achieving plan quality scores of 8.82 (±0.29) and 8.43 (±0.48), respectively. Both VTPNs outperformed treatment planning purely based on the rules, which had a plan score of 7.81 (±1.59). VTPN trained with eight episodes using KgDRL was able to perform similar to that trained using DRL with 100 epochs. The training time was reduced from more than a week to ~13 hrs.  Conclusion:   The proposed KgDRL framework was effective in accelerating the training process of a VTPN by incorporating human knowledge, which will facilitate the development of VTPN for more complicated treatment planning scenarios.""","""['Chenyang Shen', 'Liyuan Chen', 'Yesenia Gonzalez', 'Xun Jia']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['The development of a deep reinforcement learning network for dose-volume-constrained treatment planning in prostate cancer intensity modulated radiotherapy.', 'Operating a treatment planning system using a deep-reinforcement learning-based virtual treatment planner for prostate cancer intensity-modulated radiation therapy treatment planning.', 'A hierarchical deep reinforcement learning framework for intelligent automatic treatment planning of prostate cancer intensity modulated radiation therapy.', 'Knowledge-based planning for intensity-modulated radiation therapy: A review of data-driven approaches.', 'Deep reinforcement learning and its applications in medical imaging and radiation therapy: a survey.', 'Research progress on deep learning in magnetic resonance imaging-based diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer: a review on the current status and perspectives.', 'Automatic reconstruction of interstitial needles using CT images in post-operative cervical cancer brachytherapy based on deep learning.', 'Artificial Intelligence in Radiation Therapy.', ""Modeling physician's preference in treatment plan approval of stereotactic body radiation therapy of prostate cancer."", 'The development of a deep reinforcement learning network for dose-volume-constrained treatment planning in prostate cancer intensity modulated radiotherapy.']"""

Studies examining the relationship have not accounted for obesity, a risk factor for advanced PCa and altered methylation patterns. We hypothesized that obesity could moderate the association between one-carbon metabolism genes and PCa outcomes.  Methods:   We conducted secondary data analyses of the Study of Clinical Outcomes, Risk and Ethnicity. Obesity was included as a primary exposure and modifier (interacting with genetic polymorphisms) in the analytic models. We used logistic regression to determine associations of common one-carbon metabolism genotypes with odds of high stage (T3/T4) and high grade (Gleason score ≥ 7). We used Cox regression to examine associations of genotypes with biochemical recurrence.  Results:   There were 808 patients (632 White and 176 Black.) Among White men, we observed associations of TCN2_R259P with increased odds of high stage (OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.41-1.00), but no significant interactions with obesity. Among Black men, the SCL19A1_61bpdel and CBS_68bpINS variants were associated with high grade (OR = 2.61, 95% CI = 1.39-4.89 and OR = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.09-0.91, respectively.) Both the CBS_68bpINS and MTHFR_E429A variants interacted with obesity in Black men, where the highest risk for biochemical failure and odds of high grade, respectively, occurred among obese patients with variants.  Conclusions:   We observed associations of one-carbon metabolism genes with different associations by race. We also observed interactions with obesity related to PCa outcomes in Black men only. Therefore, the involvement of one-carbon metabolism on PCa was dependent upon obesity status for Black men. These novel results could help identify patients that might benefit from effective weight management targeting one-carbon metabolism effects.""","""['Scott W Keith', 'Bernard Kwabi-Addo', 'Charnita Zeigler-Johnson']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Racial Ethn Health Disparities""","""['Racial and Ethnic Trends in Prostate Cancer Incidence and Mortality in Philadelphia, PA: an Observational Study.', 'Obesity as a predictor of adverse outcome across black and white race: results from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) Database.', 'Inflammation polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk in Jamaican men: Role of obesity/body size.', 'Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Prostate Cancer Outcomes in the Veterans Affairs Health Care System.', 'Difference in Association of Obesity With Prostate Cancer Risk Between US African American and Non-Hispanic White Men in the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT).', 'Interactions of SNPs in Folate Metabolism Related Genes on Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness in European Americans and African Americans.', 'Repair-Assisted Damage Detection Reveals Biological Disparities in Prostate Cancer between African Americans and European Americans.']"""

However, the roles of lncRNA prostate androgen regulated transcript 1 (PART1) in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remain unknown. In the present study, reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR was performed to investigate the levels of PART1, SRY‑box transcription factor 6 (SOX6) and miR‑18a‑5p in ESCC tissues and cells. The functions of PART1 in ESCC were demonstrated using Cell Counting Kit‑8 and Matrigel assays. Promoter activity and dual‑luciferase reporter assays, RNA immunoprecipitation and western blot analyses were also used to determine the potential mechanisms of PART1 in ESCC cell lines. It was found that PART1 and SOX6 were both downregulated in ESCC tissues and cells, and their low expression levels were associated with TNM stage, lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis in patients with ESCC. Forkhead box protein P2 (FOXP2) exhibited low expression level in ESCC tissues, and its expression was positively correlated with PART1 expression level in ESCC tissues. FOXP2 was found to bind to the promoter region of PART1 to regulate its expression in ESCC cells. Functionally, PART1 overexpression suppressed cell proliferation and invasion, whereas PART1 downregulation promoted cell proliferation and invasion in the ESCC cell lines. Mechanistically, PART1 functions as a competing endogenous (ce)RNA by sponging miR‑18a‑5p, resulting in the upregulation of the downstream target gene, SOX6, coupled with the inactivation of the β‑catenin/c‑myc signaling axis, to suppress ESCC cell proliferation and invasion.

Here, we found that the antiandrogen Enzalutamide-resistant (EnzR) PCa cells can be suppressed by hyper-physiological doses of the androgen DHT. Mechanism dissection indicates that while androgens/androgen receptor (AR) can decrease BCL-2 expression to induce cell death, yet they can also simultaneously increase anti-apoptosis BCL-XL protein expression via decreasing its potential E3 ubiquitin ligase, PARK2, through transcriptionally increasing the miR-493-3p expression to target PARK2. Thus, targeting the high dose DHT/AR/miR-493-3p/PARK2/BCL-XL signaling with BCL-XL-shRNA can increase high-dose-DHT effect to better suppress EnzR cell growth via increasing the autophagic cell death.

Inhibitors of transcriptional coactivators that regulate AR activity, including the paralog histone acetyltransferase proteins p300 and CBP, are attractive therapeutic targets for lethal prostate cancer. Herein, we validate targeting p300/CBP as a therapeutic strategy for lethal prostate cancer and describe CCS1477, a novel small-molecule inhibitor of the p300/CBP conserved bromodomain. We show that CCS1477 inhibits cell proliferation in prostate cancer cell lines and decreases AR- and C-MYC-regulated gene expression. In AR-SV-driven models, CCS1477 has antitumor activity, regulating AR and C-MYC signaling. Early clinical studies suggest that CCS1477 modulates KLK3 blood levels and regulates CRPC biopsy biomarker expression. Overall, CCS1477 shows promise for the treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: Treating CRPC remains challenging due to persistent AR signaling. Inhibiting transcriptional AR coactivators is an attractive therapeutic strategy. CCS1477, an inhibitor of p300/CBP, inhibits growth and AR activity in CRPC models, and can affect metastatic CRPC target expression in serial clinical biopsies.See related commentary by Rasool et al., p. 1011.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 995.""","""['Jonathan Welti#', 'Adam Sharp#', 'Nigel Brooks', 'Wei Yuan', 'Christopher McNair', 'Saswati N Chand', 'Abhijit Pal', 'Ines Figueiredo', 'Ruth Riisnaes', 'Bora Gurel', 'Jan Rekowski', 'Denisa Bogdan', 'William West', 'Barbara Young', 'Meera Raja', 'Amy Prosser', 'Jordan Lane', 'Stuart Thomson', 'Jenny Worthington', 'Stuart Onions', 'Jonathan Shannon', 'Silvia Paoletta', 'Richard Brown', 'Don Smyth', 'Gareth W Harbottle', 'Veronica S Gil', 'Susana Miranda', 'Mateus Crespo', 'Ana Ferreira', 'Rita Pereira', 'Nina Tunariu', 'Suzanne Carreira', 'Antje J Neeb', 'Jian Ning', 'Amanda Swain', 'David Taddei;SUC/PCF International Prostate Cancer Dream Team;Matthew J Schiewer', 'Karen E Knudsen', 'Neil Pegg#', 'Johann S de Bono#']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Discov""","""['Toppling the HAT to Treat Lethal Prostate Cancer.', 'Toppling the HAT to Treat Lethal Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting Androgen Receptor Activation Function-1 with EPI to Overcome Resistance Mechanisms in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Bruceantin targets HSP90 to overcome resistance to hormone therapy in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'ODM-201: a new-generation androgen receptor inhibitor in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Unravelling the Role of P300 and TMPRSS2 in Prostate Cancer: A Literature Review.', 'Emerging Pharmacotherapeutic Strategies to Overcome Undruggable Proteins in Cancer.', 'Comparative analysis of drug-like EP300/CREBBP acetyltransferase inhibitors.', 'Effects of the Acetyltransferase p300 on Tumour Regulation from the Novel Perspective of Posttranslational Protein Modification.', 'Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension: Emerging Principles of Precision Medicine across Basic Science to Clinical Practice.']"""

Methods:   A Markov model was built with health states progression-free survival, progressed disease, and death. The benefits of monitoring abiraterone Cmin followed by a dose increase or food intervention were modeled via a difference in the percentage of patients achieving adequate Cmin taking a healthcare payer perspective. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess uncertainties and their impac to the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).  Results:   Monitoring abiraterone followed by a dose increase resulted in 0.149 incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) with €22 145 incremental costs and an ICER of €177 821/QALY.

Despite this, many individuals do not engage in sufficient exercise to gain the benefits. There are many barriers, which limit the uptake of face-to-face exercise in this population including lack of suitable facilities, remoteness, and access to experts, significant fatigue, urinary incontinence and motivation. Technology-enabled interventions offer a distance-based alternative. This protocol describes a pilot two-armed randomised controlled study that will investigate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an online exercise and behavioural change tool (ExerciseGuide) amongst individuals with metastatic prostate cancer.  Methods:   Sixty-six participants with histologically diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer will be randomised into either the 8-week intervention or a wait-list control. The intervention arm will have access to a tailored website, remote supervision, and tele-coaching sessions to enhance support and adherence. Algorithms will individually prescribe resistance and aerobic exercise based upon factors such as metastasis location, pain, fatigue, confidence and current exercise levels. Behavioural change strategies and education on exercise benefits, safety and lifestyle are also tailored through the website. The primary outcome will be intervention feasibility (safety, usability, acceptability, and adherence). Secondary exploratory outcomes include changes in physical activity, quality of life, sleep, and physical function. Outcomes will be measured at baseline and week 9.

Despite this, men with low-risk prostate cancer (LRPC) find management decisions distressing and confusing. We developed Navigate, an online decision aid to help men and their partners make management decisions consistent with their values. The aims are to evaluate the impact of Navigate on uptake of AS; decision-making preparedness; decisional conflict, regret and satisfaction; quality of illness communication; and prostate cancer-specific quality of life and anxiety. In addition, the healthcare cost impact, cost-effectiveness and patterns of use of Navigate will be assessed. This paper describes the study protocol.  Methods:   Three hundred four men and their partners are randomly assigned one-to-one to Navigate or to the control arm. Randomisation is electronically generated and stratified by site. Navigate is an online decision aid that presents up-to-date, unbiased information on LRPC tailored to Australian men and their partners including each management option and potential side-effects, and an interactive values clarification exercise. Participants in the control arm will be directed to the website of Australia's peak national body for prostate cancer. Eligible patients will be men within 3 months of being diagnosed with LRPC, aged 18 years or older, and who are yet to make a treatment decision, who are deemed eligible for AS by their treating clinician and who have Internet access and sufficient English to participate. The primary outcome is self-reported uptake of AS as the first-line management option. Secondary outcomes include self-reported preparedness for decision-making; decisional conflict, regret and satisfaction; quality of illness communication; and prostate cancer-specific quality of life. Uptake of AS 1 month after consent will be determined through patient self-report. Men and their partners will complete study outcome measures before randomisation and 1, 3 and 6 months after study consent.  Discussion:   The Navigate online decision aid has the potential to increase the choice of AS in LRPC, avoiding or delaying unnecessary radical treatments and associated side effects. In addition, Navigate is likely to reduce patients' and partners' confusion and distress in management decision-making and increase their quality of life.

Long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) PVT1 is an overexpressed oncogene that is associated with AR in LNCaP prostate cancer cells, and with PRC2 in HeLa and many other types of cancer cells. The possible involvement of PVT1 in mediating androgen-induced gene expression downregulation in prostate cancer has not been explored.  Methods:   LNCaP cell line was used. Native RNA-binding-protein immunoprecipitation with anti-AR or anti-EZH2 was followed by RT-qPCR with primers for PVT1. Knockdown of PVT1 with specific GapmeRs (or a control with scrambled GapmeR) was followed by differentially expressed genes (DEGs) determination with Agilent microarrays and with Significance Analysis of Microarrays statistical test. DEGs were tested as a tumor risk classifier with a machine learning Random Forest algorithm run with gene expression data from all TCGA-PRAD (prostate adenocarcinoma) tumors as input. ChIP-qPCR was performed for histone marks at the promoter of one DEG.  Results:   We show that PVT1 knockdown in androgen-stimulated LNCaP cells caused statistically significant expression upregulation/downregulation of hundreds of genes. Interestingly, PVT1 knockdown caused upregulation of 160 genes that were repressed by androgen, including a significantly enriched set of tumor suppressor genes, and among them FAS, NOV/CCN3, BMF, HRK, IFIT2, AJUBA, DRAIC and TNFRSF21. A 121-gene-set (out of the 160) was able to correctly predict the classification of all 293 intermediate- and high-risk TCGA-PRAD tumors, with a mean ROC area under the curve AUC = 0.89 ± 0.04, pointing to the relevance of these genes in cancer aggressiveness. Native RIP-qPCR in LNCaP showed that PVT1 was associated with EZH2, a component of PRC2. PVT1 knockdown followed by ChIP-qPCR showed significant epigenetic remodeling at the enhancer and promoter regions of tumor suppressor gene NOV, one of the androgen-repressed genes that were upregulated upon PVT1 silencing.  Conclusions:   Overall, we provide first evidence that PVT1 was involved in signaling a genome-wide androgen-dependent transcriptional repressive program of tumor suppressor protein-coding genes in prostate cancer cells. Identification of transcriptional inhibition of tumor suppressor genes by PVT1 highlights the pathway to the investigation of mechanisms that lie behind the oncogenic role of PVT1 in cancer.

In the past, radical cystectomy via open surgery has been considered the gold-standard treatment for muscle invasive bladder cancer. However, in recent years there has been a progressive increase in the use of robot-assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy. The aim of the current project is to investigate the surgical, oncological, and functional outcomes of patients with bladder cancer who undergo radical cystectomy comparing three different surgical techniques (robotic-assisted, laparoscopic, and open surgery). Pre-, peri- and post-operative factors will be examined, and participants will be followed for a period of up to 24 months to identify risks of mortality, oncological outcomes, hospital readmission, sexual performance, and continence.  Methods:   We describe a protocol for an observational, prospective, multicenter, cohort study to assess patients affected by bladder neoplasms undergoing radical cystectomy and urinary diversion. The Italian Radical Cystectomy Registry is an electronic registry to prospectively collect the data of patients undergoing radical cystectomy conducted with any technique (open, laparoscopic, robotic-assisted). Twenty-eight urology departments across Italy will provide data for the study, with the recruitment phase between 1st January 2017-31st October 2020. Information is collected from the patients at the moment of surgical intervention and during follow-up (3, 6, 12, and 24 months after radical cystectomy). Peri-operative variables include surgery time, type of urinary diversion, conversion to open surgery, bleeding, nerve sparing and lymphadenectomy. Follow-up data collection includes histological information (e.g., post-op staging, grading, and tumor histology), short- and long-term outcomes (e.g., mortality, post-op complications, hospital readmission, sexual potency, continence etc).  Discussion:   The current protocol aims to contribute additional data to the field concerning the short- and long-term outcomes of three different radical cystectomy surgical techniques for patients with bladder cancer, including open, laparoscopic, and robot-assisted. This is a comparative-effectiveness trial that takes into account a complex range of factors and decision making by both physicians and patients that affect their choice of surgical technique.

It has also been demonstrated that MGF used in combination with DOX resulted in enhanced anti-tumor effects. In this study, C. intermedia (HB) and MGF were used to synthesize HB-AuNPs and MGF-AuNPs, respectively. The physicochemical properties of the AuNPs were characterized by the UV-Visible Spectroscopy (UV-Vis), dynamic light scattering (DLS), Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). The cytotoxicity of HB-AuNPs and MGF-AuNPs were assessed on human colon (Caco-2), prostate (PC-3) and glioblastoma (U87) cancer cells; as well as normal breast epithelial (MCF-12A) cells using the MTT assay.

We tested this hypothesis.  Materials & methods:   Within the National Inpatient Sample database (2008-2015) we identified RP patients. The effect of MetS was tested in four separate univariable analyses, as well as in multivariable regression models predicting: 1) overall complications, 2) length of stay, 3) total hospital charges and 4) non-home based discharge. All models were weighted and adjusted for clustering, as well as all available patient and hospital characteristics.

Recently, aberrant androgen receptor (AR) signaling, including expression of the constitutively active ARV7, was reported to contribute to DTX resistance. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. Of note, previous studies have highlighted that ARV7, unlike its parental AR, potentially favors the expression of some genes involved in cell cycle progression. Since DTX mainly targets microtubule dynamics and mitosis, we wanted to test whether ARV7 plays a specific role in mitotic regulation and whether this activity is involved in DTX resistance. In the present study, we found that ARV7 mediates DTX sensitivity through inactivating the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) and promoting mitotic slippage. By shifting the balance to the slippage pathway, ARV7-expressing cells are more likely to escape from mitotic death induced by acute DTX treatment. Furthermore, we also identified E2 enzyme UBE2C as the primary downstream effector of ARV7 in promoting the SAC inactivation and premature degradation of cyclin B1. Moreover, we showed that combination treatment of DTX and an inhibitor of mitotic exit can exert synergistic effect in high ARV7-expressing prostate cancer cells. In sum, our work identified a novel role of ARV7 in promoting DTX resistance and offering a potential path to combat DTX resistance related to abnormal activation of the AR signaling and mitotic dysregulation.""","""['Bingbing Yu', 'Yanan Liu', 'Haoge Luo', 'Jiaying Fu', 'Yang Li', 'Chen Shao']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Androgen receptor negatively regulates mitotic checkpoint signaling to induce docetaxel resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A functional genomics screen reveals a strong synergistic effect between docetaxel and the mitotic gene DLGAP5 that is mediated by the androgen receptor.', 'Inhibition of Mps1 kinase enhances taxanes efficacy in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Mitotic slippage: an old tale with a new twist.', 'A Comparative Study of Tumor-Specificity and Neurotoxicity between 3-Styrylchromones and Anti-Cancer Drugs.', 'A role for androgen receptor variant 7 in sensitivity to therapy: Involvement of IGFBP-2 and FOXA1.', 'A compendium of Androgen Receptor Variant 7 target genes and their role in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Expansion of mouse castration-resistant intermediate prostate stem cells in vitro.', 'Role of prostate cancer stem-like cells in the development of antiandrogen resistance.']"""

Methods and materials:   Utilizing a large prospective uro-oncology registry, clinicopathological parameters of 1027 consecutive patients who underwent RP (2008-2017) were recorded. Oncological outcomes were determined by failure to achieve unrecordable PSA postoperatively and biochemical failure (BCF).  Results:   PDA was present in 79 (7.7%) patients, whereas 948 (92.3%) patients had conventional prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma (PAA). Patients with PDA were older (mean 64.4 vs. 62.8-years old; p = .045), had higher PSA at diagnosis (mean 12.53 vs. 10.80 ng/ml; p = .034), and a higher percentage of positive biopsy cores (mean 39.34 vs. 30.53%; p = .006). Compared to PAA, PDA exhibited a more aggressive tumor biology: (1) Grade groups 4 or 5 (26.6 vs. 9.4%, p < .001), (2) tumor multifocality (89.9 vs. 83.6%; p = .049), and (3) tumor size (mean 2.97 vs. 2.00 cm; p < .001). On multivariate analysis, PDA was independently associated with locally advanced disease (p = .002, hazard ratio [HR]: 2.786, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.473-5.263), with a trend towards positive surgical margins (p = .055) and nodal involvement (p = .061). Translating the poorer pathological features to oncological outcomes, presence of PDA independently predicted less likelihood of achieving unrecordable PSA (p = .019, HR: 2.368, 95% CI: 1.152-4.868, and higher BCF (p = .028, HR: 1.918, 95% CI: 1.074-3.423). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that a higher ductal component greater than 15% proportionally predicted worse oncological outcomes, with a shorter time to BCF of 14.3 months compared to 19.8 months in patients with ductal component lesser than 15% (p = .040, HR: 2.660, 95% CI: 1.046-6.757).

The patients were divided into the LigaSure (n = 125) and Hem-o-lok (n = 348) groups, based on the device used to ligate the vascular pedicle. Owing to differences in the patient characteristics, a 1:2 propensity score matching was performed. In the final matched cohort, 375 patients were included for analysis. The median initial prostate-specific antigen level was not significantly different between the two groups. The median surgical and console times were significantly shorter for the LigaSure group than for the Hem-o-lok group (p < 0.001 and 0.003, respectively). The number of specimens with positive surgical margins was significantly lower in the LigaSure group than in the Hem-o-lok group (24.8 vs 40.8%, p = 0.002). The number of specimens with positive surgical margins for pathological stage T2 cases was also significantly lower in the LigaSure group than in the Hem-o-lok group (17.0 vs 37.5%, p < 0.001). However, non-focal positive surgical margins and biochemical recurrence-free survival rates at 1 year postoperatively were not significantly different (11.2 vs 18.4%, p = 0.075 and 91.2 vs 92.8%, p = 0.565, respectively). The LigaSure system was associated with fewer positive surgical margins and shorter operation time, indicating that it could be a useful alternative to Hem-o-lok clips for controlling the prostatic pedicle in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy, despite its high costs.""","""['Shuzo Hamamoto', 'Mostafa AbdelRazek', 'Taku Naiki', 'Kazumi Taguchi', 'Toshiki Etani', 'Shoichiro Iwatsuki', 'Ryosuke Ando', 'Atsushi Okada', 'Noriyasu Kawai', 'Takahiro Yasui']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Robot Surg""","""['Hem-o-lok clip: a neglected cause of severe bladder neck contracture and consequent urinary incontinence after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Rectal Hem-o-Lok clip migration after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Endourethral migration of a Hem-o-Lok Clip after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Bladder Neck Contracture with Hem-o-Lok Clips Migration after Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: A Case Report and Literature Review.', 'Histopathologic outcomes of robotic radical prostatectomy.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively identified 742 patients treated with RARP + ePLND at a single center between 2012 and 2018. All patients underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and were diagnosed with targeted biopsies. First, the nomogram published by Briganti et al. was validated in our cohort. Second, three novel multivariable logistic regression models predicting LNI were developed: (1) a complete model fitted with PSA, ISUP grade groups, percentage of positive cores (PCP), extracapsular extension (ECE), and Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score; (2) a simplified model where ECE score was not included (model 1); and (3) a simplified model where PI-RADS score was not included (model 2). The predictive accuracy of the models was assessed with the receiver operating characteristic-derived area under the curve (AUC). Calibration plots and decision curve analyses were used.  Results:   Overall, 149 patients (20%) had LNI. In multivariable logistic regression models, PSA (OR: 1.03; P= 0.001), ISUP grade groups (OR: 1.33; P= 0.001), PCP (OR: 1.01; P= 0.01), and ECE score (ECE 4 vs. 3 OR: 2.99; ECE 5 vs. 3 OR: 6.97; P< 0.001) were associated with higher rates of LNI. The AUC of the Briganti et al. model was 74%. Conversely, the AUC of model 1 vs. model 2 vs. complete model was, respectively, 78% vs. 81% vs. 81%. Simplified model 1 (ECE score only) was then chosen as the best performing model. A nomogram to calculate the individual probability of LNI, based on model 1 was created. Setting our cut-off at 5% we missed only 2.6% of LNI patients.  Conclusions:   We developed a novel nomogram that combines PSA, ISUP grade groups, PCP, and mpMRI-derived ECE score to predict the probability of LNI at final pathology in RARP candidates.

Currently, there are limited data on same-day discharge (SDD) after LAAC. We aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of SDD versus non-SDD in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who underwent LAAC.  Methods:   We retrospectively studied 211 patients who underwent the WATCHMAN procedure in a tertiary hospital (June 2016 to June 2019). The primary safety outcome was the composite of stroke, systemic embolism, major bleeding requiring transfusion, vascular complications requiring endovascular intervention, or death through 7 days (periprocedural) and 45 days post-procedure. The secondary outcomes were the individual components of the primary outcome and all-cause readmission. We compared the clinical outcomes of patients who had SDD and non-SDD post-procedure.  Results:   Patients with procedure-related complications on the day of LAAC and patients who were admitted for acute clinical events before LAAC were excluded. One hundred ninety patients were included in the final analysis. Seventy-two of 190 (38%) patients had SDD, and 118 of 190 (62%) had non-SDD. There were no statistically significant differences in the primary safety outcome through 7 days (1.4% versus 5.9%; P=0.26) and 45 days post-procedure (2.8% versus 9.3%; P=0.14) between the two groups. The secondary outcomes were similar in both groups. No patients had device-related thrombus on transesophageal echocardiography at 45 days. Only 1 patient from the non-SDD group had clinically significant peri-device flow (>5 mm) at 45 days.  Conclusions:   In a selected cohort of patients who underwent successful elective LAAC with WATCHMAN without same-day procedure-related complications, the primary safety outcome and secondary outcomes through 7 and 45 days post-procedure were similar in the SDD and non-SDD groups.

This inconsistent evidence may result from small sample sizes at single institution studies and disparate characterization of costs across studies. Comprehensive studies in population-based datasets are needed to fully understand the impact of palliative care on total healthcare costs. This study analyzed the impact of palliative care on total healthcare costs in a nationally representative sample of advanced cancer patients.  Methods:   We conducted a matched cohort study among Medicare patients with metastatic lung, colorectal, breast and prostate cancers. We matched patients who received a palliative care consultation to similar patients who did not receive a palliative care consultation on factors related to both the receipt of palliative care and end of life costs. We compared direct costs between matched patients to determine the per-patient economic impact of a palliative care consultation.  Results:   Patients who received a palliative care consultation experienced an average per patient cost of $5,834 compared to $7,784 for usual care patients (25% decrease; p < 0.0001). Palliative care consultation within 7 days of death decreased healthcare costs by $451, while palliative care consultation more than 4 weeks from death decreased costs by $4,643.

This study will determine real-world hypofractionation adoption across different geographic regions for breast, prostate, cervical cancer, and bone metastases, and identify barriers and facilitators to its use.  Materials and methods:   An anonymous, electronic survey was distributed from January 2018 through January 2019 to radiation oncologists through the ESTRO-GIRO initiative. Predictors of hypofractionation were identified in univariable and multivariable regression analyses.  Results:   2316 radiation oncologists responded. Hypofractionation was preferred in node-negative breast cancer following lumpectomy (82·2% vs. 46·7% for node-positive; p < 0.001), and in low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer (57·5% and 54·5%, respectively, versus 41·2% for high-risk (p < 0.001)). Hypofractionation was used in 32·3% of cervix cases in Africa, but <10% in other regions (p < 0.001). For palliative indications, hypofractionation was preferred by the majority of respondents. Lack of long-term data and concerns about local control and toxicity were the most commonly cited barriers. In adjusted analyses, hypofractionation was least common for curative indications amongst low- and lower-middle-income countries, Asia-Pacific, female respondents, small catchment areas, and in centres without access to intensity modulated radiotherapy.  Conclusion:   Significant variation was observed in hypofractionation across curative indications and between regions, with greater concordance in palliation.

Methods:   Renal cell, melanoma, sarcoma, gastro-intestinal, and thyroid spinal metastases were identified as RR and prostate cancer (PCA) as radiosensitive. The primary endpoint was MRI-based local failure (LF). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and vertebral compression fracture (VCF).  Results:   From a prospectively maintained database of 1394 spinal segments in 605 patients treated with spine SBRT, 173 patients/395 RR spinal segments were compared to 94 patients/185 PCA segments. Most received 24-28 Gy in 2 fractions (68.9%) and median follow-up was 15.5 months (range, 1.4-84.2 months). 1- and 2-year LF rates were 19.2% and 22.4% for RR metastases, respectively, which were significantly greater (p < 0.001) than PCA (3.2% and 8.4%, respectively). Epidural disease (HR: 2.47, 95% CI 1.65-3.71, p < 0.001) and RR histology (HR: 2.41, 95% CI 1.45-3.99, p < 0.001) predicted for greater LF. Median OS was 17.4 and 61.0 months for RR and PCA cohorts, respectively. Lung/liver metastases, polymetastatic disease and epidural disease predicted for worse OS. 2-year VCF rates were ~ 13% in both cohorts. Coverage of the CTV V90 (clinical target volume receiving 90% of prescription dose) by ≥ 87% (HR: 2.32, 95% CI 1.29-4.18, p = 0.005), no prior spine radiotherapy (HR: 1.96, 95% CI 1.09-3.55, p = 0.025), and a greater Spinal Instability Neoplasia Score (p = 0.013) predicted for VCF.

Methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis of 45 patients with OM-CRPC. Whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI (WB-DWI) was used to diagnose oligo-progressive disease. Based on the clinical and radiological findings, the OM-CRPCs were classified as genuine or induced. PSDT was performed with the intent to ablate all the progressive sites detected on WB-DWI with radiotherapy. Systemic therapy remained unchanged during and after PSDT.  Results:   A total of 31 (69%) and 14 (31%) patients were diagnosed with genuine- and induced-OM-CRPC, respectively. The genuine-OM-CRPC group had significantly fewer patients treated with taxane-based chemotherapy and new hormonal drugs than the induced-OM-CRPC group. Of these, 26 OM-CRPC patients were treated with PSDT, and a 50% PSA decline was observed in 14 (93%) of 15 patients with genuine-OM-CRPC and 4 (36%) of 11 patients with induced-OM-CRPC (P = 0.033).

MRI parameters such as measurable extraprostatic extension (EPE) (≥ 3 mm), length of (pseudo)capsular contact (LCC), invasion of neurovascular bundle (NVBI), and/or seminal vesicles lesion contact (SVC) or infiltration (SVI) were assessed and correlated to clinical and histopathological results.  Results:   136 men were included. In 76 cases, a pT2 stage was determined, in 29 cases a pT3a, and in 31 a pT3b stage. The positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) for the detection of T3 by measurable EPE on MRI was 98% (CI 0.88-1) and 81% (CI 0.72-0.87). No visible NVBI was found in pT2 patients (NPV 100%; CI 0.95-1).

DNA damage stabilizes CRY1 in cancer (in vitro, in vivo, and human tumors ex vivo), which proves critical for efficient DNA repair. Further mechanistic investigation shows that stabilized CRY1 temporally regulates expression of genes required for homologous recombination.

These biopsies typically involve both a 12-core systematic biopsy (SB) and MRI-TB of the lesion. Since the majority of PI-RADS 5 lesions represent clinically significant cancers, the utility of SB in addition to MRI-TB is unclear. We evaluate the utility of SB in the setting of PI-RADS 5 lesions in biopsy naïve and active surveillance patients.  Methods:   Patients undergoing MRI-TB+SB with a PI-RADS 5 lesion were retrospectively reviewed in a prospectively collected database. Pathology obtained from the MRI-TB was then compared to that of the SB, and each was reported based on the highest Gleason Grade from the sample. In patients with a prior biopsy, we identified instances in which the MRI-TB+SB resulted in upgraded pathology and further subdivided these patients based on whether the pathology upgrade was a result of the TB or the SB.  Results:   We identified PI-RADS 5 lesions in 97 patients. All lesions biopsied were found to be prostate cancer, and 86.9% were clinically significant. Gleason Grade from the MRI-TB of the PI-RADS 5 lesions was the same or higher to that of the SB in all but 3 cases (3.1%). Among 59 patients with a prior prostate biopsy, 54 had upgraded pathology from MRI-TB+SB (91.5%). Of these 54 patients, MRI-TB pathology of the PI-RADS 5 lesion was the same or higher to that of the SB in 52 patients (96.3%). In all patients with higher Gleason Grade on SB than MRI-TB, the MRI-TB demonstrated GG3 or higher and SB did not change subsequent clinical management.

We evaluated the effects of a treatment with Tadalafil (TAD) on both these proteins.  Methods:   Androgen-sensitive human PCa cell line (LnCAP) was incubated with/without TAD (10-6 M) and bicalutamide (BCT) (10-4 M) to evaluate a potential modulation on cell proliferation, protein and mRNA expression of Cyp19a, AR and estrogen receptor-β (ERβ), respectively.  Results:   TAD increased early AR nuclear translocation (p < 0.05, after 15 min of exposure), and increased AR transcriptional activity (p < 0.05) and protein expression (p < 0.05) after 24 h. Moreover, after 24 h this treatment upregulated Cyp19a1 and ERβ mRNA (p < 0.05 and p < 0.005 respectively) and led to an increase in protein expression of both after 48 h (p < 0.05). Interestingly, TAD counteracted Cyp19a1 stimulation induced by BCT (p < 0.05) but did not alter the effect induced by BCT on the AR protein expression.  Conclusion:   We demonstrate for the first time that TAD can significantly modulate AR expression and activity, Cyp19a1 and ERβ expression in PCa cells, suggesting a specific effect of these proteins.

However, it is well-known that in breast cancer the use of F18-FDG is not included in the first line protocol of initial diagnostic, both in female and male breast cancer patients. F18-FDG PET/CT is a valuable tool to provide information on extra-axillary lymph node involvement, distant metastases, and other occult primary cancers. This study assesses F18-FDG PET/CT systemic staging in male patients with diagnosed breast cancer and determines detection rates for unsuspected distant metastases and synchronous malignancies.  Methods:   We analyzed a number of 170 male patients with breast cancer, seen between 2000-2020, in a tertiary center. From this group, between 2013-2020 a number of 23 patients underwent F18-FDG PET/CT. Rates of upstaging were determined for each case and the detection of other primary malignancies was analyzed.  Results:   Median age of male breast cancer group was 61.3 y (range, 34-85 y), most had intraductal carcinoma (82.4%) and unsuspected distant metastases, which increased patient stage to IV, observed in 27%. In 4 out 23 patients (17.4%), F18-FDG PET/CT identified synchronous cancers (2 prostate cancers, 1 thyroid and 1 colon cancer).  Conclusion:   F18-FDG PET/CT is a valuable tool to provide information on extra-axillary lymph node involvement, distant metastases, and other occult primary cancers. Baseline F18-FDG PET/CT has a substantial impact on the initial staging and on clinical management in male breast patients and should be considered for use in newly diagnosed patients.""","""['Andra Piciu', 'Doina Piciu', 'Narcis Polocoser', 'Anita A Kovendi', 'Iulia Almasan', 'Alexandru Mester', 'Dragos-Stefan Morariu', 'Calin Cainap', 'Simona Sorana Cainap']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Diagnostics (Basel)""","""['18F-FDG PET/CT for Systemic Staging of Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer in Men.', '(18)F-FDG-PET/CT for systemic staging of newly diagnosed triple-negative breast cancer.', '18F-FDG-PET/CT for systemic staging of patients with newly diagnosed ER-positive and HER2-positive breast cancer.', 'Role of FDG PET-CT in evaluation of locoregional nodal disease for initial staging of breast cancer.', 'Diagnostic Role of Fluorodeoxyglucose PET in Breast Cancer: A History to Current Application.']"""

Hispanic/Latinos (H/L) are the second largest racial/ethnic group in the US. This study aims to assess methylation patterns between aggressive and indolent PCa including DNA repair genes along with ancestry proportions. Prostate tumors classified as aggressive (n = 11) and indolent (n = 13) on the basis of the Gleason score were collected. Tumor and adjacent normal tissue were annotated on H&E (Haemotoxylin and Eosin) slides and extracted by macro-dissection. Methylation patterns were assessed using the Illumina 850K DNA methylation platform. Raw data were processed using the Bioconductor package. Global ancestry proportions were estimated using ADMIXTURE (k = 3). One hundred eight genes including AOX1 were differentially methylated in tumor samples. Regarding the PCa aggressiveness, six hypermethylated genes (RREB1, FAM71F2, JMJD1C, COL5A3, RAE1, and GABRQ) and 11 hypomethylated genes (COL9A2, FAM179A, SLC17A2, PDE10A, PLEKHS1, TNNI2, OR51A4, RNF169, SPNS2, ADAMTSL5, and CYP4F12) were identified. Two significant differentially methylated DNA repair genes, JMJD1C and RNF169, were found. Ancestry proportion results for African, European, and Indigenous American were 24.1%, 64.2%, and 11.7%, respectively.

Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3 (AKR1C3) is a vital enzyme in the intracrine androgen synthesis pathway. In this study, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were employed to deliver small interfering RNA targeting AKR1C3 (siAKR1C3) to downregulate AKR1C3 expression in CPRC cells. The optimal weight ratio of MSNs/siAKR1C3 was determined by a gel retardation assay. Prostate cancer cells such as VCaP cells, which intracrinally express AKR1C3, and LNCaP-AKR1C3 cells stably transfected with AKR1C3 were used to investigate the antitumour effect of MSNs-siAKR1C3. Fluorescence detection and Western blot analyses were applied to confirm the entrance of MSNs-siAKR1C3 into the cells. A SRB (Sulforhodamine B) assay was employed to assess the cell viability, and a radioimmunoassay was used to measure the androgen concentration. Moreover, real-time PCR (RT-PCR), Western blot analysis and ELISA were used to determine the transcription and expression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), AKR1C3 and androgen receptor (AR). Meanwhile, a reporter gene assay was performed to determine the AR activity. Additionally, a castrated nude mouse xenograft tumour model was produced to verify the inhibitory effect of MSNs-siAKR1C3 in vivo. The results showed that the optimal weight ratio of MSNs/siAKR1C3 was 140:1, and the complex could effectively enter cells, downregulate AKR1C3 expression, reduce the androgen concentration, inhibit AR activation, and inhibit CRPC development both in vitro and in vivo.

Additional population-based evidence of this association is necessary to better understand any possible protective effects of aspirin in older adults.  Objective:   To investigate the association of aspirin use with risk of developing new cancers and site-specific cancer-associated survival in bladder, breast, esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, and uterine cancers.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cohort study used data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Participants were aged 65 years or older at baseline (1993-2001) or reached age 65 during follow-up. Data analysis was conducted from January to June 2020.  Main outcomes and measures:   Incidence of and survival from the investigated cancer types. Univariable and multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression modeling, adjusting for covariates. Multivariable models for incidence included time-varying covariates.  Results:   A total of 139 896 individuals (mean [SD] age at baseline, 66.4 [2.4] years; 71 884 [51.4%] women; 123 824 [88.5%] non-Hispanic White individuals) were included in the analysis.

Aspirin use was not associated with incidence of any of the investigated cancer types among individuals aged 65 years or older. Multivariable regression analysis demonstrated that aspirin use at least 3 times/week was associated with increased survival among patients with bladder (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51-0.88) and breast (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.59-0.96) cancers but not among those with esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, or uterine cancer.

Patients and methods:   Observational study of a multicentre prospective cohort, including all consecutive cases. LATP was performed in three settings: (i) first biopsy in suspected PCa, (ii) confirmatory biopsies for active surveillance, and (iii) repeat biopsy in suspected PCa. All patients received pre-procedure antibiotics according to local hospital guidelines. Local anaesthesia was achieved by perineal skin infiltration and periprostatic nerve block without sedation. Ginsburg protocol principles were followed for systematic biopsies including cognitive magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsies when needed using the PrecisionPoint™ TP access device. Procedure-related complications and oncological outcomes were prospectively and consecutively collected. A validated questionnaire was used in a subset of centres to collect data on patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).  Results:   Some 1218 patients underwent LATP biopsies at 10 centres: 55%, 24%, and 21% for each of the three settings, respectively. Any grade PCa was diagnosed in 816 patients (67%), of which 634 (52% of total) had clinically significant disease. Two cases of sepsis were documented (0.16%) and urinary retention was observed in 19 patients (1.6%). PROMs were distributed to 419 patients, with a 56% response rate (n = 234). In these men, pain during the biopsy was described as either 'not at all' or 'a little' painful by 64% of patients. Haematuria was the most common reported symptom (77%). When exploring attitude to re-biopsy, 48% said it would be 'not a problem' and in contrast 8.1% would consider it a 'major problem'. Most of the patients (81%) described the biopsy as a 'minor or moderate procedure tolerable under local anaesthesia', while 5.6% perceived it as a 'major procedure that requires general anaesthesia'.  Conclusion:   Our data suggest that LATP biopsy using a TP access system mounted to the ultrasound probe achieves excellent PCa detection, with a very low sepsis rate, and is safe and well tolerated.

Knowledge of such beneficial consequences of prostate cancer (PCa) is limited in long-term survivors (> 5 years). Thus, the present study investigated the occurrence of benefit finding (BF) and its determinants in a large sample of (very-) long-term PCa survivors.  Methods:   BF was assessed in 4252 PCa survivors from the German database ""Familial Prostate Cancer"" using the German version of the Benefit Finding Scale (BFS). Associations between BF and sociodemographic, clinical, and psychosocial (e.g., depressive and anxiety symptoms and perceived severity of the disease experience) variables were analyzed using hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis.  Results:   Mean age at survey was 77.4 years (SD = 6.2) after a mean follow-up of 14.8 years (SD = 3.8). Mean BFS score was 3.14 (SD = 1.0); the prevalence of moderate-to-high BF (score ≥ 3) was 59.7%. Younger age at diagnosis, lower educational level, and higher perceived severity of the disease experience were predictive of BF. Objective disease severity or family history of PCa was not uniquely associated with BF.  Conclusions:   BF occurs in older, (very-) long-term PCa survivors. Our findings suggest that the self-asserted severity of the disease experience in a patient's biography is linked to BF in the survivorship course above all tangible sociodemographic and clinical factors.  Implications for cancer survivors:   PCa survivors may express BF regardless of clinical disease severity. Treating urologists should consider inquiring BF to enrich a patient's cancer narrative.""","""['Irène Lassmann', 'Andreas Dinkel', 'Birgitt Marten-Mittag', 'Matthias Jahnen', 'Helga Schulwitz', 'Jürgen E Gschwend', 'Kathleen Herkommer']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['Benefit finding in men affected by prostate cancer prior to and following radical prostatectomy - a cross-sectional study with a stratified sample.', 'Prevalence of benefit finding and posttraumatic growth in long-term cancer survivors: results from a multi-regional population-based survey in Germany.', 'Internet use after prostate cancer : Search for information and trust in disease-related information in long-term survivors.', 'Quality of Life Among Black Prostate Cancer Survivors: An Integrative Review.', 'Coping Strategies Used by Breast, Prostate, and Colorectal Cancer Survivors: A Literature Review.', 'Benefit finding in men affected by prostate cancer prior to and following radical prostatectomy - a cross-sectional study with a stratified sample.', 'Impact of caregiver burden on caregiver mental health in patients with esophageal cancer: chain mediating effects of benefit finding and rumination, a cross-sectional study.', 'Benefit finding in first-ever young and middle-aged patients who had a stroke and their spousal caregivers in China: a longitudinal mixed-methods study protocol.', 'Prostate cancer-related anxiety among long-term survivors after radical prostatectomy: A longitudinal study.', 'Biobehavioral Pathways and Cancer Progression: Insights for Improving Well-Being and Cancer Outcomes.']"""

Materials and methods:   PF@AgNPs were synthesized using P. frutescens leaf extract and silver nitrate solution. The morphology and physical properties of PF@AgNPs were studied by spectroscopic techniques including, UV-Vis, FTIR, TEM, XRD, DLS, and TGA. Antibacterial activity of PF@AgNPs was evaluated by disk diffusion assay. Antioxidant activity of PF@AgNPs was checked by 2.2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and 2.2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) free radical scavenging assays. Anticancer activity of PF@AgNPs was checked by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay. Cytotoxic effects of PF@AgNPs on most susceptible cancer cell lines were observed by phase contrast microscopy.  Results:   PF@AgNPs showed surface plasmon resonance peak at 461 nm. XRD pattern showed that the PF@AgNPs were face-centered cubic crystals with a mean size of 25.71 nm. TEM analysis revealed the different shapes (spherical, rhombic, triangle, and rod) of PF@AgNPs. Zeta potential value (-25.83 mV) indicated that PF@AgNPs were long-term stable and not agglomerated. A low polydispersity index value (0.389) indicated the monodispersity of PF@AgNPs. TGA revealed the high thermal stability of PF@AgNPs. PF@AgNPs exhibited maximum inhibition against Escherichia coli, followed by Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. PF@AgNPs showed maximum inhibition of 68.02 and 62.93% against DPPH and ABTS-free radicals, respectively.

AR and AR-V7, as transcription factors, regulate many of the same genes, but also have unique activities. In this study, the capacity of the two AR isoforms to regulate splicing was examined. RNA-seq data from models that endogenously express AR and express AR-V7 in response to doxycycline were used. Both AR isoforms induced multiple changes in splicing and many changes were isoform-specific. Analyses of two endogenous genes, PGAP2 and TPD52, were performed to examine differential splicing. A novel exon that appears to be a novel transcription start site was preferentially induced by AR-V7 in PGAP2 although it is induced to a lesser extent by AR. The previously described AR induced promoter 2 usage that results in a novel protein derived from TPD52 (PrLZ) was not induced by AR-V7. AR, but not AR-V7, bound to a site proximal to promoter 2, and induction was found to depend on FOXA1.""","""['Manjul Rana', 'Jianrong Dong', 'Matthew J Robertson', 'Paul Basil', 'Cristian Coarfa', 'Nancy L Weigel']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Author Correction: Androgen receptor and its splice variant, AR-V7, differentially induce mRNA splicing in prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptor and its splice variant, AR-V7, differentially regulate FOXA1 sensitive genes in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Differential regulation of metabolic pathways by androgen receptor (AR) and its constitutively active splice variant, AR-V7, in prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptor splice variant-7 expression emerges with castration resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Molecular Origin, Expression Regulation, and Biological Function of Androgen Receptor Splicing Variant 7 in Prostate Cancer.', 'Role of androgen receptor splice variants, their clinical relevance and treatment options.', 'Androgen Receptor Upregulates Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue 1 to Induce NF-κB Activity via Androgen-Dependent and -Independent Pathways in Prostate Carcinoma Cells.', 'A Compendium of AR Splice Variants in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Antiandrogen-Equipped Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Selectively Inhibit Androgen Receptor (AR) and AR-Splice Variant (AR-SV) in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC).', 'The METTL3 RNA Methyltransferase Regulates Transcriptional Networks in Prostate Cancer.', 'Investigation of androgen receptor-dependent alternative splicing has identified a unique subtype of lethal prostate cancer.']"""

In our prior study, CTCs in advanced prostate cancer patients were found to express CD117/c-kit in a liquid biopsy. Whether CD117 expression played an active or passive role in the aggressiveness and migration of these CTCs remained an open question. In this study, we show that CD117 expression in prostate cancer patients is associated with decreased overall and progression-free survival and that activation and phosphorylation of CD117 increases in prostate cancer patients with higher Gleason grades. To determine how CD117 expression and activation by its ligand stem cell factor (SCF, kit ligand, steel factor) alter prostate cancer aggressiveness, we used C4-2 and PC3-mm human prostate cancer cells, which contain a CD117+ subpopulation. We demonstrate that CD117+ cells display increased proliferation and migration. In prostaspheres, CD117 expression enhances sphere formation. In both 2D and 3D cultures, stemness marker gene expression is higher in CD117+ cells. Using xenograft limiting dilution assays and serial tumor initiation assays, we show that CD117+ cells represent a CSC population. Combined, these data indicate that CD117 expression potentially promotes tumor initiation and metastasis. Further, in cell lines, CD117 activation by SCF promotes faster proliferation and invasiveness, while blocking CD117 activation with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) decreased progression in a context-dependent manner. We demonstrate that CD117 expression and activation drives prostate cancer aggressiveness through the CSC phenotype and TKI resistance.""","""['Koran S Harris', 'Lihong Shi', 'Brittni M Foster', 'Mary E Mobley', 'Phyllis L Elliott', 'Conner J Song', 'Kounosuke Watabe', 'Carl D Langefeld', 'Bethany A Kerr']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['A juxtacrine/paracrine loop between C-Kit and stem cell factor promotes cancer stem cell survival in epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'Validation of stem cell markers in clinical prostate cancer: α6-integrin is predictive for non-aggressive disease.', 'Establishment and characterization of multi-drug resistant, prostate carcinoma-initiating stem-like cells from human prostate cancer cell lines 22RV1.', 'CD117/c-kit in Cancer Stem Cell-Mediated Progression and Therapeutic Resistance.', 'Identification, characterization, and biological relevance of prostate cancer stem cells from clinical specimens.', 'Appearance of tuft cells during prostate cancer progression.', 'The Molecular Biology of Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: From the Past to the Future.', 'Expression level of CD117 (KIT) on ovarian cancer extracellular vesicles correlates with tumor aggressiveness.', 'Cancer Stemness/Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Axis Influences Metastasis and Castration Resistance in Prostate Cancer: Potential Therapeutic Target.', 'Bufalin Inhibits Tumorigenesis, Stemness, and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Colorectal Cancer through a C-Kit/Slug Signaling Axis.']"""

However, the probability of suffering from second primary malignancies (SPMs) has also increased. Therefore, we downloaded SPM samples from the SEER database and then retrospectively analyzed the general characteristics of 34,891 PCa patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2016. After excluding cases with unknown clinical information, 2203 patients were used to construct and validate the overall survival (OS) nomogram of SPM patients after PCa. We found that approximately 3.69% of PCa patients were subsequently diagnosed with SPMs. In addition, the three most prevalent sites of SPM were respiratory and intrathoracic organs, skin, and hematopoietic system. The top three histological types of SPMs were squamous cell carcinoma, adenoma and adenocarcinoma, nevi and melanoma. Through univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis, we found that the site of SPM, age, TNM stage, SPM surgery history, and PCa stage were associated with the OS of SPM. By virtue of these factors, we constructed a nomogram to predict the OS of SPM. The C-index in the training set and validation set were 0.824 (95CI, 0.806-0.842) and 0.862 (95CI, 0.840-0.884), respectively.

Such studies require stool collections that can be processed or frozen in a timely manner so as not to alter the microbial content. Due to the logistical difficulties of home-based stool collection, there has been a challenge in selecting the appropriate sample collection technique and comparing results from different microbiome studies. Thus, we compared stool collection and two alternative clinic-based fecal microbiome collection techniques, including a newer glove-based collection method.  Results:   We prospectively enrolled 22 adult men from our prostate cancer screening cohort SABOR (San Antonio Biomarkers of Risk for prostate cancer) in San Antonio, TX, from 8/2018 to 4/2019. A rectal swab and glove tip sample were collected from each participant during a one-time visit to our clinics. A single stool sample was collected at the participant's home. DNA was isolated from the fecal material and 16 s rRNA sequencing of the V1-V2 and V3-V4 regions was performed. We found the gut microbiome to be similar in richness and evenness, noting no differences in alpha diversity among the collection methods. The stool collection method, which remains the gold-standard method for the gut microbiome, proved to have different community composition compared to swab and glove tip techniques (p< 0.001) as measured by Bray-Curtis and unifrac distances. There were no significant differences in between the swab and glove tip samples with regard to beta diversity (p> 0.05). Despite differences between home-based stool and office-based fecal collection methods, we noted that the distance metrics for the three methods cluster by participant indicating within-person similarities. Additionally, no taxa differed among the methods in a Linear Discriminant Analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) analysis comparing all-against-all sampling methods.  Conclusion:   The glove tip method provides similar gut microbiome results as rectal swab and stool microbiome collection techniques. The addition of a new office-based collection technique could help easy and practical implementation of gut microbiome research studies and clinical practice.""","""['Meghan I Short', 'Robert Hudson', 'Benjamin D Besasie', 'Kelly R Reveles', 'Dimpy P Shah', 'Susannah Nicholson', 'Teresa L Johnson-Pais', 'Korri Weldon', 'Zhao Lai', 'Robin J Leach', 'Bernard Fongang', 'Michael A Liss']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BMC Microbiol""","""['Rectal Swabs from Critically Ill Patients Provide Discordant Representations of the Gut Microbiome Compared to Stool Samples.', 'Comparison of stool versus rectal swab samples and storage conditions on bacterial community profiles.', 'Evaluating rectal swab collection method for gut microbiome analysis in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).', 'Rejuvenating the human gut microbiome.', 'Overview of the Microbiome Among Nurses study (Micro-N) as an example of prospective characterization of the microbiome within cohort studies.', 'The potential role of the microbiota in prostate cancer pathogenesis and treatment.', 'First-Day-of-Life Rectal Swabs Fail To Represent Meconial Microbiota Composition and Underestimate the Presence of Antibiotic Resistance Genes.', 'Gut microbiome alterations in ICU patients with enteral nutrition-related diarrhea.', 'Metagenomes of rectal swabs in larger, advanced stage cervical cancers have enhanced mucus degrading functionalities and distinct taxonomic structure.', 'Gut microbiota and plasma cytokine levels in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.']"""

Methods:   Ten prostate cancer patients previously treated with VMAT and having daily CBCT were included. First, RO-IMPT plans were created with ± 3 mm and ± 5 mm patient setup and ± 3% proton range uncertainties, respectively. Second, the planning CT (pCT) was deformably registered to the CBCT to create a synthetic CT (sCT). Both daily and weekly sampling strategies were employed to determine optimal dose accumulation frequency. Doses were recalculated on sCTs for both ± 3 mm/±3% and ± 5 mm/±3% uncertainties and were accumulated back to the pCT. Accumulated doses generated from ± 3 mm/±3% and ± 5 mm/±3% RO-IMPT plans were evaluated using the clinical dose volume constraints for CTV, bladder, and rectum.  Results:   Daily accumulated dose based on both ± 3mm/±3% and ±5 mm/±3% uncertainties for RO-IMPT plans resulted in satisfactory CTV coverage (RO-IMPT3mm/3% CTVV95 = 99.01 ± 0.87% vs. RO-IMPT5mm/3% CTVV95 = 99.81 ± 0.2%, P = 0.002). However, the accumulated dose based on ± 3 mm/3% RO-IMPT plans consistently provided greater OAR sparing than ±5 mm/±3% RO-IMPT plans (RO-IMPT3mm/3% rectumV65Gy = 2.93 ± 2.39% vs. RO-IMPT5mm/3% rectumV65Gy = 4.38 ± 3%, P < 0.01; RO-IMPT3mm/3% bladderV65Gy = 5.2 ± 7.12% vs. RO-IMPT5mm/3% bladderV65Gy = 7.12 ± 9.59%, P < 0.01). The gamma analysis showed high dosimetric agreement between weekly and daily accumulated dose distributions.  Conclusions:   This study demonstrated that for RO-IMPT optimization, ±3mm/±3% uncertainty is sufficient to create plans that meet desired CTV coverage while achieving superior sparing to OARs when compared with ± 5 mm/±3% uncertainty. Furthermore, weekly dose accumulation can accurately estimate the overall dose delivered to prostate cancer patients.""","""['Yihang Xu', 'Tejan Diwanji', 'Nellie Brovold', 'Michael Butkus', 'Kyle R Padgett', 'Ryder M Schmidt', 'Adam King', 'Alan Dal Pra', 'Matt Abramowitz', 'Alan Pollack', 'Nesrin Dogan']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Phys Med""","""['Assessment of IMPT versus VMAT plans using different uncertainty scenarios for prostate cancer.', 'Treatment planning comparison of IMPT, VMAT and 4π radiotherapy for prostate cases.', 'CBCT-Based Adaptive Assessment Workflow for Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy for Head and Neck Cancer.', 'PTV-based IMPT optimization incorporating planning risk volumes vs robust optimization.', 'Dosimetric impact of adaptive proton therapy in head and neck cancer - A review.', 'Dosimetric advantages of daily adaptive strategy in IMPT for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Assessment of CT to CBCT contour mapping for radiomic feature analysis in prostate cancer.']"""

We systematically evaluated the association of SNPs in 21 cholesterol biosynthesis pathway genes with the risk of PCa using the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial database using a logistic regression model. Gene expression data of PCa from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were applied for mRNA expression analysis. The TCGA database was used to perform expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis. The interaction between demographic factors and SNPs was analyzed using two-by-four tables. We found T allele of rs67415672 in HMGCS1 is a significant protective allele of PCa [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.83-0.97, P = 4.16 × 10-3]. Moreover, rs67415672 was an eQTL for HMGCS1 (P = 2.23 × 10-6). The expression of HMGCS1 significantly decreased in PCa primary tumors than that in normal tissues.

Ultra-hypofractionation was non-inferior to conventional fractionation regarding 5-year failure-free survival and toxicity. We aimed to assess whether patient-reported quality of life (QOL) differs between conventional fractionation and ultra-hypofractionation up to 6 years after treatment in the HYPO-RT-PC trial.  Methods:   HYPO-RT-PC is a multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial done in 12 centres (seven university hospitals and five county hospitals) in Sweden and Denmark. Inclusion criteria were histologically verified intermediate-to-high-risk prostate cancer (defined as T1c-T3a with one or two of the following risk factors: stage T3a; Gleason score ≥7; and prostate-specific antigen 10-20 ng/mL with no evidence of lymph node involvement or distant metastases), age up to 75 years, and WHO performance status 0-2. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to conventional fractionation (78·0 Gy in 39 fractions, 5 days per week for 8 weeks) or ultra-hypofractionation (42·7 Gy in seven fractions, 3 days per week for 2·5 weeks) via a minimisation algorithm with stratification by trial centre, T-stage, Gleason score, and prostate-specific antigen. QOL was measured using the validated Prostate Cancer Symptom Scale (PCSS) and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) at baseline, the end of radiotherapy, months 3, 6, 12, and 24 after radiotherapy, every other year thereafter up to 10 years, and at 15 years. The primary endpoint (failure-free survival) has been reported elsewhere. Here we report QOL, a secondary endpoint analysed in the per-protocol population, up to 6 years after radiotherapy. The HYPO-RT-PC trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN45905321.  Findings:   Between July 1, 2005, and Nov 4, 2015, 1200 patients were enrolled and 1180 were randomly assigned (conventional fractionation n=591, ultra-hypofractionation n=589); 1165 patients (conventional fractionation n=582, ultra-hypofractionation n=583) were included in this QOL analysis. 158 (71%) of 223 patients in the conventional fractionation group and 146 (66%) of 220 in the ultra-hypofractionation group completed questionnaires at 6 years. The median follow-up was 48 months (IQR 25-72). In seven of ten bowel symptoms or problems the proportion of patients with clinically relevant deteriorations at the end of radiotherapy was significantly higher in the ultra-hypofractionation group than in the conventional fractionation group (stool frequency [p<0·0001], rush to toilet [p=0·0013], flatulence [p=0·0013], bowel cramp [p<0·0001], mucus [p=0·0014], blood in stool [p<0·0001], and limitation in daily activity [p=0·0014]). There were no statistically significant differences in the proportions of patients with clinically relevant acute urinary symptoms or problems (total 14 items) and sexual functioning between the two treatment groups at end of radiotherapy. Thereafter, there were no clinically relevant differences in urinary, bowel, or sexual functioning between the groups. At the 6-year follow-up there was no difference in the incidence of clinically relevant deterioration between the groups for overall urinary bother (43 [33%] of 132 for conventional fractionation vs 33 [28%] of 120 for ultra-hypofractionation; mean difference 5·1% [95% CI -4·4 to 14·6]; p=0·38), overall bowel bother (43 [33%] of 129 vs 34 [28%] of 123; 5·7% [-3·8 to 15·2]; p=0·33), overall sexual bother (75 [60%] of 126 vs 59 [50%] of 117; 9·1% [-1·4 to 19·6]; p=0·15), or global health/QOL (56 [42%] of 134 vs 46 [37%] of 125; 5·0% [-5·0 to 15·0]; p=0·41).

We sought to determine the relation of TSH and free T4 levels with overall cancer risk as well as risk of specific cancer types.  Design and methods:   Data on thyroid hormone profile was collected from 375 635 Israeli patients with no prior history of cancer. Cancer cases were identified via the Israel National Cancer Registry. Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess hazard ratios for overall cancer as well as 20 cancer subgroups.  Results:   In this study, 23 808 cases of cancer were detected over median follow up of 10.9 years. Among patients younger than 50 at inclusion, TSH in the hyperthyroid range, elevated free T4 and subclinical hyperthyroidism were associated with increased cancer risk (HR: 1.3, 1.28 and 1.31, respectively). In contrast, patients 50 or older with clinical hyperthyroidism were at lower cancer risk (HR: 0.64). Elevated TSH was associated with decreased risk of prostate cancer (HR: 0.67). Log-TSH elevation was associated with decreased risk of thyroid cancer (HR: 0.82) and increased risk of melanoma (HR: 1.11) and uterine cancer (HR: 1.27). Elevated free T4 was associated with increased lung cancer risk (HR: 1.54), while free T4 levels above the normal range and clinical hyperthyroidism were related to lower colorectal cancer risk (HR: 0.59 and 0.08, respectively).

Patients and methods:   Thirty-four prostate cancer patients were retrospectively included: 16 patients with and 18 without lymph node metastases as determined by PSMA PET/CT. Patients underwent PSMA PET/CT as well as portal venous phase abdominal SDCT for clinical cancer follow-up. Only scan pairs with a stable nodal status indicated by constant size as well as comparable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were included. One hundred benign and 96 suspected metastatic lymph nodes were annotated and correlated between SDCT and PSMA PET/CT. Iodine concentration in SDCT-derived iodine maps and SUVmax in ultra-high definition reconstructions from PSMA PET/CT were acquired based on the region of interest.  Results:   Metastatic lymph nodes as per PSMA PET/CT showed higher IC than nonmetastatic nodes (1.9 ± 0.6 mg/mL vs 1.5 ± 0.5 mg/mL, P < 0.05) resulting in an AUC of 0.72 and sensitivity/specificity of 81.3%/58.5%. The mean short axis diameter of metastatic lymph nodes was larger than that of nonmetastatic nodes (6.9 ± 3.6 mm vs 5.3 ± 1.3 mm; P < 0.05); a size threshold of 1 cm short axis diameter resulted in a sensitivity/specificity of 12.8%/99.0%. There was a significant yet weak positive correlation between SUVmax and IC (rs = 0.25; P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Spectral detector CT-derived IC was increased in lymph nodes diagnosed as metastatic in PSMA PET/CT yet showed considerable data overlap.

Low efficiency in EV isolation from biofluids, however, severely restricts their downstream characterization and analysis. Here, we introduced a novel strategy for EV isolation from urine for prostate cancer diagnosis using bifunctionalized magnetic beads through high affinity Ti(IV) ions and the insertion of a phospholipid derivative, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, into the EV membrane synergistically. We demonstrated its efficient isolation of EVs from urine samples with low contamination, high recovery (>80%), and short separation time (within 1 h), resulting in the identification of 36,262 unique EV peptides corresponding to 3302 unique proteins and 3233 unique phosphopeptides representing 1098 unique phosphoproteins using only 100 μL and 5 mL urine samples, respectively. Coupled with trapped ion mobility spectrometry and parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation for phosphosite-specific resolution, quantitative phosphoproteomics of urine samples from prostate cancer patients and healthy individuals revealed 121 upregulated phosphoproteins in cancer patients in contrast to the healthy group. These particular advantages indicate that the novel bifunctional material enables sensitive EV phosphoproteomic analysis for noninvasive biomarker screening and early cancer diagnosis.""","""['Jie Sun', 'Shanying Han', 'Leyao Ma', 'Hao Zhang', 'Zhen Zhan', 'Hillary Andaluz Aguilar', 'Haiyang Zhang', 'Ke Xiao', 'Yanhong Gu', 'Zhongze Gu', 'W Andy Tao']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""ACS Appl Mater Interfaces""","""['Highly Efficient Phosphoproteome Capture and Analysis from Urinary Extracellular Vesicles.', 'Proteomics, Phosphoproteomics and Mirna Analysis of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles through Automated and High-Throughput Isolation.', 'Profiling Phosphoproteome Landscape in Circulating Extracellular Vesicles from Microliters of Biofluids through Functionally Tunable Paramagnetic Separation.', 'Affinity-based isolation of extracellular vesicles and the effects on downstream molecular analysis.', 'Extracellular Vesicle Proteome in Prostate Cancer: A Comparative Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Studies.', 'Progress in Isolation and Molecular Profiling of Small Extracellular Vesicles via Bead-Assisted Platforms.', 'Endogenous Lipid Carriers-Bench-to-Bedside Roadblocks in Production and Drug Loading of Exosomes.', 'Magnetic bead-based adsorption strategy for exosome isolation.', 'Proteomics and Phosphoproteomics of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles Provide New Insights into Diabetes Pathobiology.', 'Application of nanomaterials in proteomics-driven precision medicine.']"""

Objectives:   We assessed the reliability of polygenic score values to estimate prostate cancer (PCa), breast cancer (BCa) and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk in three incident cohorts from the UK Biobank (n>500 000).  Methods:   Cancer-specific Genetic Risk Score (GRS), a well-established population-standardised polygenic risk score, was calculated.

On the basis of preliminary data as a diagnostic ligand, the isomer rhPSMA-7.3 is a promising candidate for potential endoradiotherapy. The aim of this preclinical evaluation was to assess the biodistribution, dosimetry, and therapeutic efficacy of 19F/177Lu-rhPSMA-7.3 in comparison to the established therapeutic agent 177Lu-PSMA I&T (imaging and therapy). Methods: The biodistribution of 19F/177Lu-rhPSMA-7.3 and 177Lu-PSMA I&T was determined in LNCaP tumor-bearing severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice after sacrifice at defined time points up to 7 d (n = 5). Organs and tumors were dissected, percentage injected dose per gram (%ID/g) was determined, and dosimetry was calculated using OLINDA/EXM, version 1.0. The therapeutic efficacy of a single 30-MBq dose of 19F/177Lu-rhPSMA-7.3 (n = 7) was compared with that of 177Lu-PSMA I&T in treatment groups (n = 7) and control groups (n = 6-7) using C4-2 tumor-bearing SCID mice by evaluating tumor growth and survival over 6 wk after treatment. Results: The biodistribution of 19F/177Lu-rhPSMA-7.3 revealed fast blood clearance (0.63 %ID/g at 1 h after injection), and the highest activity uptake was in the spleen and kidneys, particularly in the first hour (33.25 %ID/g and 207.6 %ID/g, respectively, at 1 h after injection), indicating a renal excretion pathway. Compared with 177Lu-PSMA I&T, 19F/177Lu-rhPSMA-7.3 exhibited an initial (1 h) 2.6-fold higher tumor uptake in LNCaP xenografts and a longer retention (4.5 %ID/g vs. 0.9 %ID/g at 168 h). The tumor dose of 19F/177Lu-rhPSMA-7.3 was substantially higher (e.g., 7.47 vs. 1.96 µGy/MBq at 200 mm3) than that of 177Lu-PSMA I&T. In most organs, absorbed doses were higher for 177Lu-PSMA I&T. A significantly greater tumor size reduction was shown for a single dose of 19F/177Lu-rhPSMA-7.3 than for 177Lu-PSMA I&T at the end of the experiment (P = 0.0167). At the predefined termination of the experiment at 6 wk, 7 of 7 and 3 of 7 mice were still alive in the 19F/177Lu-rhPSMA-7.3 and 177Lu-PSMA I&T groups, respectively, compared with the respective control groups, with 0 of 7 and 0 of 6 mice. Conclusion: Compared with 177Lu-PSMA I&T, 19F/177Lu-rhPSMA-7.3 can be considered a suitable candidate for clinical translation because it has similar clearance kinetics and a similar radiation dose to healthy organs but superior tumor uptake and retention.

Methods:   We estimated rate ratios (RRs) for the association between these 3 age-adjusted measures and risk of colorectal (N = 813), gastric (N = 165), kidney (N = 139), lung (N = 327), mature B-cell (N = 423), prostate (N = 846), and urothelial (N = 404) cancer using conditional logistic regression models. We also assessed associations by time since blood draw and by cancer subtype, and we investigated potential nonlinearity.  Results:   We observed relatively strong associations of age-adjusted PhenoAge with risk of colorectal, kidney, lung, mature B-cell, and urothelial cancers (RR per SD was approximately 1.2-1.3). Similar findings were obtained for age-adjusted GrimAge, but the association with lung cancer risk was much larger (RR per SD = 1.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.44 to 2.30), after adjustment for smoking status, pack-years, starting age, time since quitting, and other cancer risk factors. Most associations appeared linear, larger than for the first-generation measures, and were virtually unchanged after adjustment for a large set of sociodemographic, lifestyle, and anthropometric variables. For cancer overall, the comprehensively adjusted rate ratio per SD was 1.13 (95% CI = 1.07 to 1.19) for PhenoAge and 1.12 (95% CI = 1.05 to 1.20) for GrimAge and appeared larger within 5 years of blood draw (RR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.15 to 1.44 and 1.19, 95% CI = 1.06 to 1.33, respectively).  Conclusions:   The methylation-based measures PhenoAge and GrimAge may provide insights into the relationship between biological aging and cancer and be useful to predict cancer risk, particularly for lung cancer.""","""['Pierre-Antoine Dugué', 'Julie K Bassett', 'Ee Ming Wong', 'JiHoon E Joo', 'Shuai Li', 'Chenglong Yu', 'Daniel F Schmidt', 'Enes Makalic', 'Nicole Wong Doo', 'Daniel D Buchanan', 'Allison M Hodge', 'Dallas R English', 'John L Hopper', 'Graham G Giles', 'Melissa C Southey', 'Roger L Milne']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""JNCI Cancer Spectr""","""['Methylation-based markers of aging and lifestyle-related factors and risk of breast cancer: a pooled analysis of four prospective studies.', 'DNA methylation-based biological aging and cancer risk and survival: Pooled analysis of seven prospective studies.', 'Mitochondria and aging in older individuals: an analysis of DNA methylation age metrics, leukocyte telomere length, and mitochondrial DNA copy number in the VA normative aging study.', 'Association of Neighborhood Deprivation With Epigenetic Aging Using 4 Clock Metrics.', 'The Impact of Exercise on Telomere Length, DNA Methylation and Metabolic Footprints.', 'High DNA methylation age deceleration defines an aggressive phenotype with immunoexclusion environments in endometrial carcinoma.', 'Time to relapse in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and DNA-methylation-based biological age.', 'Clinical biomarker-based biological aging and risk of cancer in the UK Biobank.', 'Multi-omic underpinnings of epigenetic aging and human longevity.', 'Can frailty scores predict the incidence of cancer?

Principal component (PC) analysis and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (TSNE) analysis were performed to identify marker genes. CRPC cells were clustered and annotated. GO and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses among marker genes were performed. A total of 1500 genes with larger standardized variance were obtained. The top 20 genes were demonstrated in each identified 20 PCs. PC with P-value < 0.05 was selected, including PC1, PC7, PC8, and PC14. The TSNE analysis classified cells as two clusters. The top 6 genes in cluster 0 included HBB, CCL5, SLITRK4, GZMB, BBIP1, and PF4V1. Plus, the top 6 genes in cluster 1 included MLEC, CCT8, CCT3, EPCAM, TMPRSS2, EIF4G2. The GO analysis revealed that these marker genes were mainly enriched in RNA catabolic process, translational initiation, mitochondrial inner membrane, cytosolic part, ribosome, cell adhesion molecule binding, cadherin binding, and structural constituent of ribosome. The KEGG analysis showed that these marker genes mainly enriched in metabolism associated pathways, including carbon metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, propanoate metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, and citrate cycle pathways.

However, the clinical significance of CELSR3 in prostate cancer (PCa) has not been fully studied. Methods: The expression of CELSR3 was detected by crossover analysis of the public datasets and cell lines. MTT assay and migration assay were performed to evaluate the cells' physiological functioning. Co-expressed genes and enrichment analysis was performed to investigate the biological significance of CELSR3 in PCa. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the expression levels of hub genes (CENPE, CENPA, CDC20, NUF2, ESPL1, PLK1) related to CELSR3. Results: We found a significant increase in CELSR3 expression in PCa patients and cell lines. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis showed that CELSR3 protein expression was significantly more highly expressed in the PCa tissues compared to the non-cancerous PCa tissues. CELSR3 downregulation significantly suppressed cell proliferation and migration potential. CELSR3-related hub genes (CENPE, CENPA, CDC20, NUF2, ESPL1, PLK1) were selected and the functions of these hub genes showed that the function of CELSR3 was closely related to the cell cycle-related signaling pathways. The upregulation of CELSR3 mRNA expression in the PCa tissues significantly correlated with the presence of high serum PSA levels, high pathological stage, high Gleason score, short overall survival time and short disease-free survival time. Conclusion: Our data suggest that CELSR3 may play an important role in the progression of PCa.

To investigate whether combined treatment with ENZ and DIM can overcome ENZ resistance by regulating Wnt signaling to inhibit AR signaling and EMT in ENZ-resistant prostate cancer cells, 22Rv1 cells were cultured in normal medium and treated with ENZ, DIM, and DIM with ENZ. Exposure of ENZ-resistant cells to both DIM and ENZ significantly inhibited cell proliferation without cytotoxicity and invasion in comparison with the control. DIM significantly increased the E-cadherin expression and inhibited the expressions of Vimentin and Fibronectin, subsequently inhibiting EMT. Co-treatment with ENZ and DIM significantly increased the expressions of GSK3β and APC and decreased the β-catenin protein expression, causing inhibition of Wnt signaling and AR expression, it also significantly decreased the AR-v7 expression and down-regulated AR signaling. Via suppression of Wnt and AR signaling, co-treatment increased the E-cadherin and decreased the Vimentin and Fibronectin RNA and protein expressions, then inhibited EMT.

There is a pressing need to develop effective treatments using newly available preclinical models for therapeutic discovery and drug evaluation. Here, we use multiomics integration of whole-exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and mass spectrometry-based proteomics on 14 LGSOC cell lines to elucidate novel biomarkers and therapeutic vulnerabilities. Comparison of LGSOC cell line data with LGSOC tumor data enabled predictive biomarker identification of MEK inhibitor (MEKi) efficacy, with KRAS mutations found exclusively in MEKi-sensitive cell lines and NRAS mutations found mostly in MEKi-resistant cell lines. Distinct patterns of Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer mutational signatures were identified in MEKi-sensitive and MEKi-resistant cell lines. Deletions of CDKN2A/B and MTAP genes were more frequent in cell lines than tumor samples and possibly represent key driver events in the absence of KRAS/NRAS/BRAF mutations. These LGSOC cell lines were representative models of the molecular aberrations found in LGSOC tumors. For prediction of in vitro MEKi efficacy, proteomic data provided better discrimination than gene expression data. Condensin, minichromosome maintenance, and replication factor C protein complexes were identified as potential treatment targets in MEKi-resistant cell lines. This study suggests that CDKN2A/B or MTAP deficiency may be exploited using synthetically lethal treatment strategies, highlighting the importance of using proteomic data as a tool for molecular drug prediction. Multiomics approaches are crucial to improving our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of LGSOC and applying this information to develop new therapies.

Moreover, whether waist circumference (WC) is more strongly associated with specific cancers than BMI is not well established. We aimed to investigate the associations between BMI and 26 cancers accounting for non-linearity and residual confounding by smoking status as well as to compare cancer risk estimates between BMI and WC.  Methods:   Prospective cohort study with population-based electronic health records from Catalonia, Spain. We included 3,658,417 adults aged ≥ 18 years and free of cancer at baseline between 2006 and 2017. Our main outcome measures were cause-specific hazard ratios (HRs) with 99% confidence intervals (CIs) for incident cancer at 26 anatomical sites.  Results:   After a median follow-up time of 8.3 years, 202,837 participants were diagnosed with cancer. A higher BMI was positively associated with risk of nine cancers (corpus uteri, kidney, gallbladder, thyroid, colorectal, breast post-menopausal, multiple myeloma, leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma) and was positively associated with three additional cancers among never smokers (head and neck, brain and central nervous system, Hodgkin lymphoma). The respective HRs (per 5 kg/m2 increment) ranged from 1.04 (99%CI 1.01 to 1.08) for non-Hodgkin lymphoma to 1.49 (1.45 to 1.53) for corpus uteri cancer. While BMI was negatively associated to five cancer types in the linear analyses of the overall population, accounting for non-linearity revealed that BMI was associated to prostate cancer in a U-shaped manner and to head and neck, esophagus, larynx, and trachea, bronchus and lung cancers in an L-shaped fashion, suggesting that low BMIs are an approximation of heavy smoking. Of the 291,305 participants with a WC measurement, 27,837 were diagnosed with cancer. The 99%CIs of the BMI and WC point estimates (per 1 standard deviation increment) overlapped for all cancers.

The objective of this study was to examine the clinical value of DACT-2 promoter methylation in serum of patients with PCa, to discover a potential diagnostic marker for PCa.  Methods:   We investigated the methylation status of DACT-2 in the serum of 64 patients with PCa, 22 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and 47 healthy subjects by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and real-time methylation-specific PCR (QMSP). Further, we evaluated the relationship between DACT-2 methylation and clinic pathological parameters. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was applied to assess the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic value of DACT-2 methylation and PSA levels.  Results:   The results of MSP and QMSP showed that the level of methylation of DACT-2 promoter in patients with PCa was significantly higher than that in patients with BPH and healthy subjects. The PCa patients Gleason score and tumor node metastasis (TNM) positively correlated with promoter methylation level of serum DACT-2. The DACT-2 methylation rate was 0.745 with a sensitivity of 81.8%, and a specificity of 75.0%, the sensitivity, and specificity of PSA was 80.1% and 59.4%.

Measurements of their zinc content showed an extant heterogeneity in total and free intracellular zinc pools associated with varying biological behavior of individual cells, e.g., autophagy levels and propensity to cell death. Use of zinc pyrithione elevated intracellular zinc in a short time frame which resulted in marked changes in mitochondrial activity and lysosomes. These alterations were accompanied by significantly enhanced autophagy flux and subsequent cell demise in the absence of typical apoptotic cell death markers. The present results show for the first time that acutely increased intracellular zinc in melanoma cells specifically enhances their autophagic activity via mitochondria and lysosomes which leads to autophagic cell death.

The need for positive PSMA imaging before PSMA-TRT to select patients is largely practiced, but its utility is not proven. Given target heterogeneity, developing a biomarker to identify the optimal patient population remains an unmet need. The aim of this study was to assess PSMA uptake by imaging and response to PSMA-TRT.  Methods:   We performed an analysis of men with mCRPC enrolled in sequential prospective phase I/II trials of PSMA-TRT. Each patient had baseline PSMA imaging by planar 111 In and/or 177 Lu SPECT (N = 171) or 68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT (N = 44), but the results were not used to include/exclude treatment. Semiquantitative imaging scores (IS) on a 0-4 scale were assigned based on PSMA uptake in tumors compared to liver uptake. We compared the ≥50% PSA decline response proportions between low (0-1) and high (2-4) PSMA IS using the χ2 -test. We used multivariable logistic regression analysis to understand the relationship between independent and dependent variables, including IS, radionuclide activity (dose) administered, CALGB (Halabi) prognostic risk score, prior taxane use.  Results:   215 men with progressive mCRPC received PSMA-TRT as follows: 177 Lu-J591 (n = 137), 177 Lu-PSMA-617 (n = 44), 90 Y-J591 (n = 28), 177 Lu-J591 + 177 Lu-PSMA-617 (n = 6). High PSMA expression (IS 2-4) was found in 160 (74.4%) patients and was significantly associated with more frequent ≥ 50% PSA reduction (26.2 vs. 7.3%, p = .006). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, higher IS was associated with a ≥50% decrease in PSA, even after accounting for CALGB (Halabi) prognostic score, the dose administered, and previous taxane use (OR, 4.72; 95% CI, 1.71-16.85; p = .006).

Reconstructing their evolutionary history can improve our understanding of how cancers develop and respond to treatment. Subclonal reconstruction methods cluster mutations into groups that co-occur within the same subpopulations, estimate the frequency of cells belonging to each subpopulation, and infer the ancestral relationships among the subpopulations by constructing a clone tree. However, often multiple clone trees are consistent with the data and current methods do not efficiently capture this uncertainty; nor can these methods scale to clone trees with a large number of subclonal populations. Here, we formalize the notion of a partially-defined clone tree (partial clone tree for short) that defines a subset of the pairwise ancestral relationships in a clone tree, thereby implicitly representing the set of all clone trees that have these defined pairwise relationships. Also, we introduce a special partial clone tree, the Maximally-Constrained Ancestral Reconstruction (MAR), which summarizes all clone trees fitting the input data equally well. Finally, we extend commonly used clone tree validity conditions to apply to partial clone trees and describe SubMARine, a polynomial-time algorithm producing the subMAR, which approximates the MAR and guarantees that its defined relationships are a subset of those present in the MAR. We also extend SubMARine to work with subclonal copy number aberrations and define equivalence constraints for this purpose. Further, we extend SubMARine to permit noise in the estimates of the subclonal frequencies while retaining its validity conditions and guarantees. In contrast to other clone tree reconstruction methods, SubMARine runs in time and space that scale polynomially in the number of subclones. We show through extensive noise-free simulation, a large lung cancer dataset and a prostate cancer dataset that the subMAR equals the MAR in all cases where only a single clone tree exists and that it is a perfect match to the MAR in most of the other cases. Notably, SubMARine runs in less than 70 seconds on a single thread with less than one Gb of memory on all datasets presented in this paper, including ones with 50 nodes in a clone tree. On the real-world data, SubMARine almost perfectly recovers the previously reported trees and identifies minor errors made in the expert-driven reconstructions of those trees.

Among other alterations, CRPC has been associated with metabolic reprogramming driven by androgens. Here, we investigated the role of androgens in regulating glutaminolysis in PCa cells and determined the relevance of this metabolic route in controlling the survival and growth of androgen-sensitive (LNCaP) and CRPC (DU145 and PC3) cells.  Methods:   PCa cells (LNCaP, DU145 and PC3) and 3-month old rats were treated with 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Alternatively, LNCaP cells were exposed to the glutaminase inhibitor BPTES, alone or in combination with the anti-androgen bicalutamide. Biochemical, Western blot and extracellular flux assays were used to evaluate the viability, proliferation, migration and metabolism of PCa cells in response to DHT treatment or glutaminase inhibition.  Results:   We found that DHT up-regulated the expression of the glutamine transporter ASCT2 and glutaminase, both in vitro in LNCaP cells and in vivo in rat prostate cells. BPTES diminished the viability and migration of PCa cells, while increasing caspase-3 activity. CRPC cells were found to be more dependent on glutamine and more sensitive to glutaminase inhibition. BPTES and bicalutamide co-treatment had an additive effect on suppressing LNCaP cell viability. Finally, we found that inhibition of glutaminolysis differentially affected glycolysis and lipid metabolism in both androgen-sensitive and CRPC cells.  Conclusion:   Our data reveal glutaminolysis as a central metabolic route controlling PCa cell fate and highlight the relevance of targeting glutaminase for CRPC treatment.""","""['Henrique J Cardoso', 'Marília I Figueira', 'Cátia V Vaz', 'Tiago M A Carvalho', 'Luís A Brás', 'Patrícia A Madureira', 'Paulo J Oliveira', 'Vilma A Sardão', 'Sílvia Socorro']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cell Oncol (Dordr)""","""['(14)CFluciclovine (alias anti-(14)CFACBC) uptake and ASCT2 expression in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Galectin-3 Is Implicated in Tumor Progression and Resistance to Anti-androgen Drug Through Regulation of Androgen Receptor Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Accumulation of trans-1-amino-3-(18)Ffluorocyclobutanecarboxylic acid in prostate cancer due to androgen-induced expression of amino acid transporters.', 'Classical and Non-Classical Roles for Pre-Receptor Control of DHT Metabolism in Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'The 5α-androstanedione pathway to dihydrotestosterone in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Amino Acids in Cancer and Cachexia: An Integrated View.', 'Druggable Metabolic Vulnerabilities Are Exposed and Masked during Progression to Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Hormone-Glutamine Metabolism: A Critical Regulatory Axis in Endocrine-Related Cancers.', 'The Integration of Metabolomics with Other Omics: Insights into Understanding Prostate Cancer.', 'Personalized Medicine for Prostate Cancer: Is Targeting Metabolism a Reality?']"""

Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for all cancers and for site-specific cancers were used to assess whether AS was associated with an increased risk of cancer.Results: During the follow-up period, 485 patients developed cancer. The incidence rate was therefore 256.3 per 100 000 person-years. Compared with the general population, patients with AS had an increased risk of cancer [SIR 1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20-1.47].

However, similarly to many natural and synthetic anticancer compounds, GTN presents toxicity toward some healthy cells and low aqueous solubility, decreasing its bioavailability and precluding its application as an antineoplastic drug. In our efforts to improve the pharmacokinetic behavior and selectivity of GTN against cancer cells, we developed a polymeric nanosystem, in which rac-GTN was encapsulated in pH-responsive acetalated dextran (Ac-Dex) nanoparticles (NPs) with high loadings of the bioactive compound. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis showed that the nanoparticles obtained presented a narrow size distribution of around 100 nm in diameter, whereas electron microscopy (EM) images showed nanoparticles with a regular spherical morphology in agreement with the size range obtained by DLS. Stability and release studies indicated that the GTN@Ac-Dex NPs presented high stability under physiological conditions (pH 7.4) and disassembled under slightly acidic conditions (pH 5.5), releasing the rac-GTN in a sustained manner. In vitro assays showed that GTN@Ac-Dex NPs significantly increased cytotoxicity and selectivity against cancer cells when compared with the empty Ac-Dex NPs and the free rac-GNT. Cellular uptake and morphology studies using MCF-7 cells demonstrated that GTN@Ac-Dex NPs are rapidly internalized into the cancer cells, causing cell death. In vivo investigation confirmed the efficient release of rac-GTN from GTN@Ac-Dex NPs, resulting in the delay of prostate cancer progression in transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model. Furthermore, liver histopathology evaluation after treatment with GTN@Ac-Dex NPs showed no evidence of toxicity. Therefore, the in vitro and in vivo findings suggest that the Ac-Dex NPs are a promising nanosystem for the sustained delivery of rac-GTN into tumors.""","""['Carolyne B Braga', 'Larissa A Kido', 'Ellen N Lima', 'Celina A Lamas', 'Valéria H A Cagnon', 'Catia Ornelas', 'Ronaldo A Pilli']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""ACS Biomater Sci Eng""","""['Biodegradable and pH-Responsive Acetalated Dextran (Ac-Dex) Nanoparticles for NIR Imaging and Controlled Delivery of a Platinum-Based Prodrug into Cancer Cells.', 'Synthesis and characterization of acetalated dextran polymer and microparticles with ethanol as a degradation product.', 'Aerosolized antimicrobial agents based on degradable dextran nanoparticles loaded with silver carbene complexes.', 'Acetalated dextran based nano- and microparticles: synthesis, fabrication, and therapeutic applications.', 'Emerging anticancer potentials of goniothalamin and its molecular mechanisms.', 'ZIF-90 nanoparticles modified with a homing peptide for targeted delivery of cisplatin.', 'Combination of Goniothalamin and Sol-Gel-Derived Bioactive Glass 45S5 Enhances Growth Inhibitory Activity via Apoptosis Induction and Cell Cycle Arrest in Breast Cancer Cells MCF-7.', 'Revealing the Potential Application of EC-Synthetic Retinoid Analogues in Anticancer Therapy.']"""

Androgen receptor (AR) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) play key roles in the initiation and progression of this cancer.

Human lymph node carcinoma of the prostate (LNCaP) cells were treated with miR-34a mimic or/and miR-93 inhibitor with or without EGCG.

The transfection with miR-34a mimics significantly reduced the mRNA expression of AR (p=0.0016), and PSA (p=0.038) compared to the control. Also, the miR-93 inhibitor led to a decrease in the mRNA expression of AR (p=0.0057) and PSA (p>0.05) compared to the control group. Furthermore, the co-transfection, along with EGCG, caused more decrease in both the AR (p<0.001) and the PSA (p=0.003) expression compared with the co-transfection without EGCG.

We assessed HRD score (defined as the sum of loss-of-heterozygosity, telomeric allelic imbalance, and large-scale state transitions) in three cohorts of primary prostate cancer, including a Johns Hopkins University (JHU) cohort with germline mutations in BRCA2, ATM, or CHEK2 (n = 64), the TCGA cohort (n = 391), and the PROGENE cohort (n = 102).

For TCGA tumors without underlying HR pathway mutations, the median HRD score was 11, significantly lower than ovarian carcinoma lacking BRCA1/2 mutations (median = 28). In the absence of HR gene mutations, the median HRD score was unexpectedly higher among prostate cancers with TP53 mutations versus those without (17 vs. 11; p = 0.015); this finding was confirmed in the PROGENE cohort (24 vs. 16; p = 0.001). Finally, among eight BRCA2-altered patients who received olaparib, progression-free survival trended longer in those with HRD scores above versus below the median (14.9 vs. 9.9 months). We conclude that HRD scores are low in primary prostate cancer and higher in cases with germline BRCA2 or somatic TP53 mutations.

It is prepackaged in 60 mg single-dose vials, a quantity much higher than the average prescribed dose, which leads to, substantial drug wastage (DW) and associated costs. To minimize DW we implemented a cost-saving, cohorting strategy where multiple patients scheduled to receive cabazitaxel (at a dose of 20mg/m2 every 3 wks) were cohorted and treated on a single weekday whenever possible. Excess drug from each vial was then saved and used for subsequent patients treated on the same day. The drug cost with cohorting was calculated from the actual number of vials used, and the drug cost without cohorting was estimated by assumingthat one vial was used per treatment. The cost of DW was determined based on the amount of drug that was discarded. All cost calculations also accounted for the discount incentives offered by Sanofi-Aventis. Over a 3-yr period, 74 patients received 402 treatments of cabazitaxel. Multiple patients were treated on 67.4% of the treatment days, and grouping of three patients on one day saved one vial. The estimated total drug cost saved was $394 536 CAD (21.1%). Pending further studies on safety and efficacy, this strategy could potentially be adopted to mitigate DW for cabazitaxel and similarly for other oncology drugs. This would significantly decrease the overall financial burden on patients, institutions, and stakeholders. PATIENT SUMMARY: Cabazitaxel chemotherapy is associated with substantial drug wastage and associated costs. By cohorting patients scheduled to receive cabazitaxel on a single weekday, the total drug cost was decreased by $394 536 CAD (21.1%) over a 3-yr period. Similar strategies could be considered to overcome the prohibitory costs associated with drug wastage for cabazitaxel and other cancer drugs.""","""['Di Maria Jiang', 'Nazanin Fallah-Rad', 'Roy Lee', 'Pamela Ng', 'Alan D Smith', 'Aaron R Hansen', 'Anthony M Joshua', 'Jaclyn Beca', 'Srikala S Sridhar']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Budgetary Impact of Cabazitaxel Use After Docetaxel Treatment for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Cabazitaxel for Hormone-Relapsed Metastatic Prostate Cancer Previously Treated With a Docetaxel-Containing Regimen: An Evidence Review Group Perspective of a NICE Single Technology Appraisal.', 'Custirsen (OGX-011) combined with cabazitaxel and prednisone versus cabazitaxel and prednisone alone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel (AFFINITY): a randomised, open-label, international, phase 3 trial.', 'Cabazitaxel plus carboplatin for the treatment of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers: a randomised, open-label, phase 1-2 trial.', 'Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: changing landscape with cabazitaxel.', 'Cost analysis of implementing a vial-sharing strategy for chemotherapy drugs using intelligent dispensing robots in a tertiary Chinese hospital in Sichuan.', 'Treatment of nonmetastatic CRPC : Androgen receptor inhibition as new treatment standard in nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with high risk of metastasis.']"""

While several connections between NF-κB signaling and the oncogene c-Myc have been shown, functional links between the signaling molecules are still poorly studied.  Methods:   Molecular interactions were shown by co-immunoprecipitation and FRET microscopy. Phosphorylation of c-Myc was shown by kinases assays and its activity by improved reporter gene systems. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout and chemical inhibition were used to block IKK activity. The turnover of c-Myc variants was determined by degradation in presence of cycloheximide and by optical pulse-chase experiments.. Immunofluorescence of mouse prostate tissue and bioinformatics of human datasets were applied to correlate IKKα- and c-Myc levels. Cell proliferation was assessed by EdU incorporation and apoptosis by flow cytometry.  Results:   We show that IKKα and IKKβ bind to c-Myc and phosphorylate it at serines 67/71 within a sequence that is highly conserved. Knockout of IKKα decreased c-Myc-activity and increased its T58-phosphorylation, the target site for GSK3β, triggering polyubiquitination and degradation. c-Myc-mutants mimicking IKK-mediated S67/S71-phosphorylation exhibited slower turnover, higher cell proliferation and lower apoptosis, while the opposite was observed for non-phosphorylatable A67/A71-mutants. A significant positive correlation of c-Myc and IKKα levels was noticed in the prostate epithelium of mice and in a variety of human cancers.  Conclusions:   Our data imply that IKKα phosphorylates c-Myc on serines-67/71, thereby stabilizing it, leading to increased transcriptional activity, higher proliferation and decreased apoptosis.""","""['Bernhard Moser', 'Bernhard Hochreiter', 'José Basílio', 'Viola Gleitsmann', 'Anja Panhuber', 'Alan Pardo-Garcia', 'Bastian Hoesel', 'Manuel Salzmann', 'Ulrike Resch', 'Mamoona Noreen', 'Johannes A Schmid']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Regulation and function of IKK and IKK-related kinases.', 'A20-binding inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)-2 (ABIN-2) is an activator of inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkappaB) kinase alpha (IKKalpha)-mediated NF-kappaB transcriptional activity.', 'Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax induction of NF-kappaB involves activation of the IkappaB kinase alpha (IKKalpha) and IKKbeta cellular kinases.', 'Phosphorylation of serine 68 in the IkappaB kinase (IKK)-binding domain of NEMO interferes with the structure of the IKK complex and tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activity.', 'Phosphorylation meets ubiquitination: the control of NF-kappaB activity.', 'Targeting Myc-driven stress addiction in colorectal cancer.', 'NF-κB in monocytes and macrophages - an inflammatory master regulator in multitalented immune cells.', 'Traditional Chinese medicine for transformation of gastric precancerous lesions to gastric cancer: A critical review.', 'Antagonistic Functions of Androgen Receptor and NF-κB in Prostate Cancer-Experimental and Computational Analyses.', 'Anti-Inflammatory Effect of Korean Propolis on Helicobacter pylori-Infected Gastric Mucosal Injury Mice Model.']"""

The lncRNA prostate cancer associated transcript 1 (PCAT1) has been involved in tumorigenesis of multiple malignant solid tumors, but it is largely unknown that what is the role of lncRNA-PCAT1 and how it functions in the progression of lung cancer. Herein, we observed that lncRNA PCAT1 expression was upregulated in both human NSCLC tissues and cell lines, which was determined by qualitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. Then, gain-and loss-of-function manipulations were performed in A549 cells by transfection with a specific short interfering RNA against PCAT1 or a pcDNA-PCAT1 expression vector. The results showed that PCAT1 not only promoted NSCLC cell proliferation and invasion but also inhibited cell apoptosis. Bioinformatics and expression correlation analyses revealed that there was a potential interaction between PCAT1 and the dyskerin pseudouridine synthase 1 (DKC1) protein, an RNA-binding protein. Then, RNA pull-down assays with biotinylated probes and transcripts both confirmed that PCAT1 directly bounds with DKC1 that could also promote NSCLC cell proliferation and invasion and inhibit cell apoptosis. Moreover, the effects of PCAT1 and DKC1 on NSCLC functions are synergistic. Furthermore, PCAT1 and DKC1 activated the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/protein kinase B (AKT)/Bcl-2/caspase9 pathway in NSCLC cells, and inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor, AKT, or Bcl-2 could eliminate the effect of PCAT1/DKC1 co-overexpression on NSCLC cell behaviors.

TO is often accompanied by endotracheal stenosis from cartilage proliferation and is often detected by difficult endotracheal intubation incidence. CASE REPORT Here we report the case of a patient (67-year-old man) with TO scheduled to undergo robot-assisted total prostatectomy for prostate cancer. The tracheal lumen was especially narrow at an area 1 cm below the glottis, with the smallest lumen diameter being 9 mm. After rapid induction, the bronchoscope passed through the stenosed region, and a 6.5-mm spiral endotracheal tube (ETT) was inserted with bronchoscopic assistance. However, because of resistance, the spiral ETT could not pass through the stenosed area. After changing to a 6.5-mm normal ETT, intubation was successfully performed with gentle rotation. Owing to the rotation, the tip entered and gained access to the gap between nodules. With use of a bronchoscope, we confirmed that the tip of the ETT was advanced 10 cm from the glottis, where the site of maximum stenosis was not covered by the tube cuff, and where the tip did not cross the bifurcation. After surgery, no bleeding or edema was found on bronchoscopy. CONCLUSIONS In patients with TO, it is important to assess the airway condition and prepare for difficult intubation. In this case, tracheal intubation was performed with rotation using a bronchoscope and normal ETT.""","""['Ryoko Takamori', 'Kazuhiro Shirozu', 'Ryosuke Hamachi', 'Kiyokazu Abe', 'Shoko Nakayama', 'Ken Yamaura']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Am J Case Rep""","""['Tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica and difficult intubation: case report and perioperative recommendations for anesthesiologists.', 'Tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica: a rare cause of difficult intubation.', 'Bronchoscopic Surgery for a Solitary Tracheal Tumor of Tracheobronchopathia Osteochondroplastica.', 'Tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica: two cases and a review of the literature.', 'Tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica: a rare large airway disorder.', 'Tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica: a rare cause of tracheal tube cuff leak.', 'Tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica: clinical, bronchoscopic, and comorbid features in a case series.']"""

It integrated the following radiobiological mechanisms: oxygenation, including hypoxic death; division of tumor cells; VEGF diffusion driving angiogenesis; division of healthy cells and oxygen-dependent response to irradiation, considering, cycle arrest and mitotic catastrophe. A thorough sensitivity analysis using the Morris screening method was performed on 21 prostate computational tissues.

Although androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), the most common treatment for prostate cancer, initially promotes a robust T cell infiltrate, T cell responses are later attenuated. Based on the castration-sensitive Myc-CaP model, we developed an antigen-specific system to study CD8 T cell tolerance to prostate tumors. This model is unique in that CD8 T cells recognize a bona-fide tumor antigen (Her-2/neu), rather than an overexpressed xenogenic antigen like chicken ovalbumin or influenza hemagglutinin. Using this novel model, we demonstrate robust tolerance that is not alleviated by TLR agonists or ADT. This model may serve as a novel and useful tool to further interrogate methods by which to augment anti-tumor cancer immune responses to prostate cancer.  Significance:   Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death in men worldwide, with an estimated 33,000 deaths projected in the U.S. in 2020. Although primary (localized) tumors can be cured by surgery or radiation, approximately 40% of patients eventually develop recurrent disease. While initially responsive to androgen-deprivation, many patients with recurrent prostate cancer eventually progress to a more advanced disease state known as metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC); this is the lethal phenotype. These studies describe a novel androgen-responsive murine cell line that expresses a bona-fide tumor antigen (Her-2/neu). Pre-clinical work with this model shows robust and antigen-specific CD8 T cell tolerance, providing a novel preclinical model to study CD8 T cell tolerance to prostate tumors.""","""['Zoila A Lopez-Bujanda', 'Matthew G Chaimowitz', 'Todd D Armstrong', 'Jeremy B Foote', 'Leisha A Emens', 'Charles G Drake']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Oncoimmunology""","""['Efficacy Against Human Prostate Cancer by Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-specific, Transforming Growth Factor-β Insensitive Genetically Targeted CD8+ T-cells Derived from Patients with Metastatic Castrate-resistant Disease.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

However, considering clinical application of open and low field MR with a limited field of view can result in truncation of the patient's anatomy which further affects the MR to sCT conversion. In this study an acquisition protocol and subsequent MR image stitching is proposed to overcome the limited field of view restriction of open MR scanners, for MR-only photon and proton therapy.  Material and methods:   12 prostate cancer patients scanned with an open 0.35T scanner were included. To obtain the full body contour an enhanced imaging protocol including two repeated scans after bilateral table movement was introduced. All required structures (patient contour, target and organ at risk) were delineated on a post-processed combined transversal image set (stitched MRI). The postprocessed MR was converted into a sCT by a pretrained neural network generator. Inversely planned photon and proton plans (VMAT and SFUD) were designed using the sCT and recalculated for rigidly and deformably registered CT images and compared based on D2%, D50%, V70Gy for organs at risk and based on D2%, D50%, D98% for the CTV and PTV. The stitched MRI and the untruncated MRI were compared to the CT, and the maximum surface distance was calculated. The sCT was evaluated with respect to delineation accuracy by comparing on stitched MRI and sCT using the DICE coefficient for femoral bones and the whole body.  Results:   Maximum surface distance analysis revealed uncertainties in lateral direction of 1-3mm on average. DICE coefficient analysis confirms good performance of the sCT conversion, i.e. 92%, 93%, and 100% were obtained for femoral bone left and right and whole body. Dose comparison resulted in uncertainties below 1% between deformed CT and sCT and below 2% between rigidly registered CT and sCT in the CTV for photon and proton treatment plans.  Discussion:   A newly developed acquisition protocol for open MR scanners and subsequent Sct generation revealed good acceptance for photon and proton therapy. Moreover, this protocol tackles the restriction of the limited FOVs and expands the capacities towards MR guided proton therapy with horizontal beam lines.""","""['Lukas Zimmermann', 'Martin Buschmann', 'Harald Herrmann', 'Gerd Heilemann', 'Peter Kuess', 'Gregor Goldner', 'Tufve Nyholm', 'Dietmar Georg', 'Nicole Nesvacil']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Z Med Phys""","""['Dosimetric evaluation of MR-derived synthetic-CTs for MR-only proton treatment planning.', 'Feasibility of MRI-only treatment planning for proton therapy in brain and prostate cancers: Dose calculation accuracy in substitute CT images.', 'Deep learning approaches using 2D and 3D convolutional neural networks for generating male pelvic synthetic computed tomography from magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Image-Guided Proton Therapy: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Modern mid-field magnetic resonance imaging in private practice : Field report.', 'Synthetic computed tomography for low-field magnetic resonance-only radiotherapy in head-and-neck cancer using residual vision transformers.', 'Possibilities and challenges when using synthetic computed tomography in an adaptive carbon-ion treatment workflow.', 'Efficient full Monte Carlo modelling and multi-energy generative model development of an advanced X-ray device.', 'An MRI sequence independent convolutional neural network for synthetic head CT generation in proton therapy.']"""

However, its mechanism of action is still unclear. This study was undertaken to investigate the mechanism underlying the anticancer effects of hesperidin against prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   The CCK-8 kit-based proliferation analysis was performed to find out the effect of hesperidin administration on prostate cancer cell growth, in vitro. Apoptosis of cancer cells was studied with dual Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide (PI) staining combined with flow cytometry. The latter was also used for the analysis of cancer cell mitotic cell cycle. The intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined with ROS-detection kit. Fluorescent probing was used for determination of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) of prostate cancer cells. The migration and invasion of cancer cells was studied using transwell assay.  Results:   The in vitro treatment of prostate cancer cells led to significant decrease of cell growth and viability in a dose-dependent manner. The decline in the growth of cancer cells was shown to be resulting from initiation of cell cycle arrest and necrosis-like apoptotic cell death. The latter was shown to be triggered by intracellular accumulation of ROS molecules and reduction of MMP. Moreover, the hesperidin administration significantly reduced the cancer cell migration and invasion.  Conclusion:   Hesperidin was shown to selectively inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells through apoptosis triggered by ROS generation.

Methods:   A total of 168 PC patients aged 38-75 years admitted to and treated in our hospital from January 2017 to January 2018 underwent radical prostatectomy. Differences in the levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and tumor markers in the patients before and after treatment were compared. The patients were divided into recurrence group (group 1) and non-recurrence group (group 2) according to postoperative recurrence. The risk factors for biochemical recurrence were analyzed by comparing the PC stage, body mass index (BMI), Gleason score and the positive resection margin between the two groups of patients.  Results:   There was a significant difference in the expression level of serum PSA in PC patients before and after treatment, and the PSA level was decreased remarkably after treatment, which was lower than that before treatment (p<0.05). The expression levels of tumor markers, neuron-specific enolases (NSE), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in PC patients after treatment were decreased and were obviously lower than those before treatment (p<0.05). The proportion of patients with tumors in stage T3 was the largest in group 1, and the proportion of patients with tumors in stage T1 was the largest in group 2. Through comparison, it was found that the disease condition of the patients in group 2 was better than that in group 1 (p<0.05). The results showed that the proportion of patients with BMI ≥30 in group 1 was the largest, while that of patients with BMI <30 in group 2 was the largest, displaying a statistically significant difference (p<0.05). There were 29 patients with Gleason score >8 points in group 1 and 34 patients with Gleason score ≤6 points in group 2, showing a statistically significant difference (p<0.05). The number of patients with positive resection margin ≥60% in group 1 was larger than that in group 2 (p<0.05). It was also discovered from the multivariate analysis that Gleason score, cancer stage, BMI and resection margin were all the risk factors for biochemical recurrence of patients after radical prostatectomy (p<0.05).  Conclusions:   Radical prostatectomy brings good efficacy in the treatment of the disease, which can evidently reduce the PSA and tumor marker levels in the patients.

Nowadays, the biological function of PVT1-214 on the response of CRC to chemotherapy is still unclear. We aimed to explore the molecular mechanism of PVT1-214 and its regulatory mechanism in advanced CRC.  Methods:   The levels of PVT1-214, microRNA (miR)-128, and interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) in CRC tissues and cell lines were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Log-rank test was applied to evaluate the role of high PVT1-214 levels in shortening the overall survival of CRC patients. Chi-square test was to assess the relation between PVT1-214 expression and clinicopathological features of CRC patients. CCK8 assays tested the cell proliferation of oxaliplatin-resistant CRC cells (HCT116/Oxa and SW480/Oxa) with PVT1-214 knockdown. The underlying regulatory mechanism between PVT1-214 and miR-128 was predicted by bioinformatics and verified by RNA transfection, qRT-PCR and western blotting. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was done to examine the relationship between or IRF-1 and the PVT1-214 gene.  Results:   High levels of PVT1-214 expression were more likely to be present in patients with late-stage (IV), chemotherapy resistance, and inferior overall survival. PVT1-214 was aberrantly elevated in oxaliplatin-resistant CRC tissues and cell lines (HCT116/Oxa and SW480/Oxa). PVT1-214 knockdown reduced cell proliferation, migration and invasion of oxaliplatin-resistant CRC cells in vitro. Moreover, IRF-1 was found to be a negative transcription regulator of PVT1-214 and decreased PVT1-214 levels in oxaliplatin-resistant CRC cells. Besides, PVT1-214 repressed miR-128 function by binding to the complementary sites of miR-128.  Conclusions:   IRF-1/PVT1-214 may markedly boost the oxaliplatin-resistance of CRC, resulting in the late TNM stage and poor survival. These findings suggest that the IRF-1/PVT1-214 axis may be a helpful target for intervention in CRC.""","""['Lintao Jiang', 'Chunhua Wan', 'Qinghao Guo', 'Jingdong Wu', 'Jun Cai']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J BUON""","""['IRF-1 mediated long non-coding RNA PVT1-214 promotes oxaliplatin resistance of colorectal cancer via miR-128 inhibition.', 'ELF1 activated long non-coding RNA CASC2 inhibits cisplatin resistance of non-small cell lung cancer via the miR-18a/IRF-2 signaling pathway.', 'Knockdown of long noncoding RNA PVT1 suppresses cell proliferation and invasion of colorectal cancer via upregulation of microRNA-214-3p.', 'Long noncoding RNA PVT1-214 enhances gastric cancer progression by upregulating TrkC expression in competitively sponging way.', 'Upregulated plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 promotes cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis in colorectal cancer.', 'IRF-1-inhibited lncRNA XIST regulated the osteogenic differentiation via miR-450b/FBXW7 axis.']"""

Immunohistochemistry was used for validation of three genes in an independent, clinically annotated prostatectomy patient cohort (n = 175) with biochemical relapse as endpoint.

We generated treatment plans mimicking eight-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) plans generated for the Novalis radiosurgery system. 2D dose planes were generated with multiple static beam spots collimated by a fixed circular cone. The weights of the uniformly distributed beam spots in each dose plane were optimized using the attraction-repulsion model. The beam spots were converted to the scanning speed to generate the raster scanning plan. To shorten treatment time, we also developed a hybrid scanning method which combines static beams with larger cone sizes and the raster scanning method. Differences between the Novalis and the scanning plan's dose planes were evaluated with the criterion of a 5% dose difference. The mean passing rates of three cases were > 85% for cone sizes ≤ 12.5 mm. Although the total monitor units (MU) increased for smaller cone sizes in an inverse-square manner, the hybrid scanning method greatly reduced the total MU, while maintaining dose distributions comparable to those with the Novalis plan. The estimated treatment time of the hybrid scanning with a 12.5 mm cone size was on average 22% shorter than that of the sequential plans. This technique will be useful in allowing the CyberKnife with conventional circular cones to achieve excellent dose distribution with a shortened treatment time.""","""['Hiroya Shiomi', 'Yuichi Akino', 'Iori Sumida', 'Norihisa Masai', 'Ryoong-Jin Oh', 'Kazuhiko Ogawa']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Radiat Res""","""['Optimization of Fluence Map for CyberKnife Raster Scanning Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy.', 'Dosimetric quality and delivery efficiency of robotic radiosurgery for brain metastases: Comparison with C-arm linear accelerator based plans.', 'Treatment planning for spinal radiosurgery : A\xa0competitive multiplatform benchmark challenge.', 'Evaluation of volumetric modulated arc therapy for cranial radiosurgery using multiple noncoplanar arcs.', 'Fully automated treatment planning for MLC-based robotic radiotherapy.']"""

The Sterol O-acyltransferase 1 (SOAT1), cholesterol metabolism enzyme, was widely expressed in various cancer tissues, resulting in cancer progression. SOAT1 has been demonstrated to be highly expressed in prostate cancer tissues, whereas the underlying mechanism has not been elucidated. Herein, we found the expression of SOAT1 was elevated in human PCa tissues, which demonstrated SOAT1 level was correlated with lymph node metastasis (p = 0.006), clinical stage (p = 0.032), grading (p = 0.036), and Gleason score (p = 0.030) of PCa patients. In addition, we revealed that SOAT1 promoted proliferation and liposynthesis of PCa cells by targeting Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase 1 (SCD1). Our data further confirmed that SCD1 overexpression reversed the proliferation and liposynthesis defects caused by SOAT1 depletion in PCa cells, however, SOAT1 depletion inhibited tumor growth of PCa cells in mice. We further found SOAT1 contributed to the progression of PCa via SREBF1 pathway. Taken together, our data revealed the mechanism underlying SOAT1 promoting PCa progression in vitro and in vivo.""","""['Yuan Liu', 'Yeqiang Wang', 'Sida Hao', 'Yong Qin', 'Yuye Wu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat""","""['High expression of Sterol-O-Acyl transferase 1 (SOAT1), an enzyme involved in cholesterol metabolism, is associated with earlier biochemical recurrence in high risk prostate cancer.', 'Inhibition of SOAT1 Suppresses Glioblastoma Growth via Blocking SREBP-1-Mediated Lipogenesis.', 'SOAT1 deficiency attenuates atherosclerosis by regulating inflammation and cholesterol transportation via HO-1 pathway.', 'SOAT1 Promotes Gastric Cancer Lymph Node Metastasis Through Lipid Synthesis.', 'Stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha: independent and interactive roles in the regulation of lipid metabolism.', 'Current Progress and Outlook for Agrimonolide: A Promising Bioactive Compound from Agrimonia pilosa Ledeb.', 'New insights into lipid metabolism and prostate cancer (Review).', 'Is There a Role of Warburg Effect in Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness?

This approach lacks sensitivity and specificity and is associated with many negative biopsies, high rate of diagnosing clinically insignificant disease and lacks accuracy to predict clinically significant (CS) cancer. The addition of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) before prostate biopsy reduces the detection of low-grade tumors while improving the detection of CS CaP. Most studies that evaluated mpMRI performance did not separate the DRE status of the examined patients. Therefore, the aim of our study is to investigate whether mpMRI provides similar advantages in detection of CaP according to the DRE findings.  Materials and methods:   This prospective study included patients with clinically suspected CaP that were referred to MRI-fusion biopsy from 2014 to 2019. All patients had mpMRI of the prostate with an index lesion of PIRADS ≥3. Analysis was done comparing systemic and targeted biopsy. Patients were divided into two groups according to the DRE findings (positive or negative DRE) and the primary outcomes were compared between the 2 study groups: detection rate of CaP and the detection rate of CS disease defined as Gleason score ≥ 7.  Results:   The final study cohort included 86 patients: 47 with negative DRE and 39 with positive DRE. Overall cancer detection rate was higher in patients with a positive DRE (70.3% vs 48.9%, P <0.05). In the region of interest a higher overall detection rate and of CS disease was found in those with abnormal DRE (51.3% vs. 40.4% and 48.6% vs. 34.0% respectively). The systematic biopsy analysis showed an overall lower detection rate in the negative DRE group (8.5% vs. 18.9 %). The targeted biopsies detected more cancer and significant tumors per core in patients with positive DRE (29.2% vs. 18.5% and 22.1% vs. 14.5% respectively).  Conclusions:   Patients submitted to fusion biopsy and have a positive DRE are diagnosed more often with CaP, have higher grade disease and larger tumors. In patients suspicious for CaP and having a significant lesion on mpMRI one should combine targeted and systematic biopsy regardless of the DRE status.""","""['Nativ Omri', 'Shefler Alex', 'Bejar Jacob', 'Nativ Ofer']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Who Benefits from Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging After Suspicion of Prostate Cancer?', 'Detection of Gleason 6 prostate cancer in patients with clinically significant prostate cancer on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Not All Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Biopsies Are Equal: The Impact of the Type of Approach and Operator Expertise on the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', 'A comparison of magnetic resonance imaging techniques used to secure biopsies in prostate cancer patients.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Predictors of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer in Patients with PIRADS Categories 3-5 Undergoing Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Ultrasound Fusion Biopsy of the Prostate.', '18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT-derived semi-quantitative parameters for risk stratification of newly diagnosed prostate cancer.', 'Digital Rectal Examination in Stockholm3 Biomarker-based Prostate Cancer Screening.']"""

Investigation of the impact of registration modality (pelvic bones or prostate) on the CTV to PTV margins of pelvic lymph nodes. Investigation of the variations of bladder and rectum over the treatment course. Investigation of the impact of bladder and rectum variations on prostate position.  Patients and methods:   This study included 15 patients treated for prostate adenocarcinoma. Daily kilo voltage images and weekly CBCT scans were performed to assess prostate displacements and common and external iliac vessels motion. These data was used to calculate the CTV to PTV margins using Van Herk equation in the setting of a daily bone registration. We also compared the CTV to PTV margins of pelvic lymph nodes according to registration method; based on pelvic bone or prostate. We delineated bladder and rectum on all CBCT scans to assess their variations over treatment course at 4 anatomic levels [1.5cm above pubic bone (PB), superior edge, mid- and inferior edge of PB].  Results:   Using Van Herk equation, the prostate CTV to PTV margins (bone registration) were 8.03mm, 5.42mm and 8.73mm in AP, ML and SI direction with more than 97% of prostate displacements were less than 5mm. The CTV to PTV margins ranged from 3.12mm to 3.25mm for external iliac vessels and from 3.12mm to 4.18mm for common iliac vessels. Compared to registration based on prostate alignment, bone registration resulted in an important reduction of the CTV to PTV margins up to 54.3% for external iliac vessels and up to 39.6% for common iliac vessels. There was no significant variation of the mean bladder volume over the treatment course. There was a significant variation of the mean rectal volume before and after the third week of treatment. After the third week, the mean rectal volume seemed to be stable. The uni- and multivariate analysis identified the anterior wall of rectum as independent factor acting on prostate motion in AP direction at 2 levels (superior edge of, mid PB). The right rectal wall influenced the prostate motion in ML direction at inferior edge of PB. The bladder volume tends toward significance as factor acting on prostate motion in AP direction.  Conclusions:   We recommend CTV to PTV margins of 8mm, 6mm and 9mm in AP, ML and SI directions for prostate. And, we suggest 4mm and 5mm for external and common iliac vessels respectively. We also prefer registration based on bony landmarks to minimize bowel irradiation.

In treatment planning automation has the potential to address differences due to user-experience and training, promoting standardisation. The aim of this study was to evaluate implementation and clinical effect of a multicentre collaboratively-developed automated planning model for Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy/Volumetric-Modulated Arc Therapy of prostate. The model was built using a variety of public institutions' clinical plans, incorporating different contouring and dose protocols, aiming at minimising their variation.  Methods and materials:   A model using 110 clinically approved and treated prostate plans provided by different radiotherapy centres was built with RapidPlan (RP), for use on intact and post-prostatectomy prostate cases. The model was validated, distributed and introduced into clinical practice in all institutions. To investigate its impact a total of 126 patients, originally manually inverse planned (OP), were replanned using RP without additional planner manual intervention. Target and organ-at-risk (OAR) metrics were statistically compared between original and automated plans.  Results:   For all centres combined and individually, RP provided plans comparable or superior to OP for all dose metrics. Statistically significant reductions with RP were found in bladder (V40Gy) and rectal (V50Gy) low doses (within 2.3% and 3.4% for combined and 4% and 10% individually). No clinically significant changes were seen for the PTV, independently of seminal vesicle inclusion.

This current study aimed to design a multimodality nanoconjugate to be used for both PET and optical imaging and as a therapeutic radio/photo sensitizer and anti-angiogenesis agent. Initial characterization of this novel nanoconjugate was performed via HPLC, FTIR, TEM and DLS analyses. Pt@TiO2-SPHINX was further evaluated using fluorometric and radiochromatographic methods. Cytotoxicity, cell uptake and internalization were also investigated as well as therapy with photodynamic/radio therapy combinations. Both nanoparticles and nanoconjugates were robustly synthesized according to literature methods. Radiochemistry and cell culture assays showed high 89Zr radiolabeling efficiency with sufficient stability for studies at later time points. Pt@TiO2-SPHINX was shown to target prostate cancer cells (PC3 and LNCaP), and was non-toxic to normal prostate cells (RWPE-1). This finding was supported by the WST-8 assay and AFM images. The uptake of the compound in prostate cancer cells is significantly higher than prostate normal cells and according to ELISA results, Pt@TiO2-SPHINX can increase anti-angiogenic VEGFA165b. Additionally, Pt@TiO2-SPHINX dramatically decreased the cell viability of prostate cancer cells when photodynamic and radio therapy were performed at the same time.

Internal calibration by ADC ratios can address such fluctuations however can potentially lower the biological value of quantitative ADC determination by being sensitive to deviations in reference tissue signal.  Purpose:   To better understand the predictive value of quantitative ADC measurements in comparison to internal reference ratios when measured in a single scanner, single protocol setup.  Materials and methods:   284 consecutive patients who underwent 3 T MRI on a single scanner followed by MRI-transrectal ultrasound fusion biopsy were included. A board-certified radiologist retrospectively reviewed all MRIs blinded to clinical information and placed regions of interest (ROI) on all focal lesions and the following reference regions: normal-appearing peripheral zone (PZNL) and transition zone (TZNL), the urinary bladder (BLA), and right and left internal obturator muscle (RIOM, LIOM). ROI-based mean ADC and ADC ratios to the reference regions were compared regarding their ability to predict the aggressiveness of prostate cancer. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to estimate the correlation between ADC parameters, Gleason score (GS) and ADC ratios. The primary endpoint was presence of sPC, defined as a GS ≥ 3 + 4. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to predict sPC. Receiver operating characteristics curves (ROC) were used for visualization; DeLong test was used to evaluate the differences of the area under the curve (AUC). Bias-corrected AUC values and corresponding 95 %-CI were calculated using bootstrapping with 100 bootstrap samples.  Results:   After exclusion of patients who received prior treatment, 259 patients were included in the final cohort of which 220 harbored 351 MR lesions.

A Notch signaling pathway is an important pathway in cell proliferation, differentiation, and fate. However, currently, the effects of abiraterone based-anti-androgene therapy and docetaxel, the most commonly used standard chemotherapy in prostate cancer treatment, on Notch signaling pathway are unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effects of abiraterone acetate and docetaxel on the expression of Notch1, Jagged1 and Hes1 in prostate cancer cell lines.  Methods:   In vitro effects of abiraterone acetate and docetaxel were examined on Notch1, Jagged1, and Hes1 expression in LNCaP and PC3 PCa cell lines by immunofluorescence, Western blot, and qRT-PCR. MTT proliferation assay was used to evaluate cell proliferation and survival.  Results:   We found that in the treatment of PC3 cells with abiraterone acetate, docetaxel, and their combination, only mRNA expressions of Notch1, Jagged1 and Hes1 were affected compared to control, but these expression differences were not observed in protein expression. In LNCaP cells, abiraterone acetate and the combination groups reduced Notch1 protein expression. All treatment groups did not alter Jagged1 expression compared to control, but significantly increased the Hes1 gene and protein expression.  Conclusion:   Our findings suggest that abiraterone and docetaxel treatments affects the expression of Notch signal pathway proteins.

We have provided evidence that small extracellular vesicles released by PrCa cells and containing the αVβ3 integrin promote neuroendocrine differentiation of PrCa in vivo and in vitro. Here, we examined αVβ3 integrin expression in three murine models carrying a deletion of PTEN (SKO), PTEN and RB1 (DKO), or PTEN, RB1 and TRP53 (TKO) genes in the prostatic epithelium; of these three models, the DKO and TKO tumors develop NEPrCa with a gene signature comparable to those of human NEPrCa. Immunostaining analysis of SKO, DKO and TKO tumors shows that αVβ3 integrin expression is increased in DKO and TKO primary tumors and metastatic lesions, but absent in SKO primary tumors. On the other hand, SKO tumors show higher levels of a different αV integrin, αVβ6, as compared to DKO and TKO tumors. These results are confirmed by RNA-sequencing analysis. Moreover, TRAMP mice, which carry NEPrCa and adenocarcinoma of the prostate, also have increased levels of αVβ3 in their NEPrCa primary tumors. In contrast, the αVβ6 integrin is only detectable in the adenocarcinoma areas. Finally, analysis of 42 LuCaP patient-derived xenografts and primary adenocarcinoma samples shows a positive correlation between αVβ3, but not αVβ6, and the neuronal marker synaptophysin; it also demonstrates that αVβ3 is absent in prostatic adenocarcinomas. In summary, we demonstrate that αVβ3 integrin is upregulated in NEPrCa primary and metastatic lesions; in contrast, the αVβ6 integrin is confined to adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Our findings suggest that the αVβ3 integrin, but not αVβ6, may promote a shift in lineage plasticity towards a NE phenotype and might serve as an informative biomarker for the early detection of NE differentiation in prostate cancer.""","""['Fabio Quaglia', 'Shiv Ram Krishn', 'Yanqing Wang', 'David W Goodrich', 'Peter McCue', 'Andrew V Kossenkov', 'Amy C Mandigo', 'Karen E Knudsen', 'Paul H Weinreb', 'Eva Corey', 'William K Kelly', 'Lucia R Languino']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['The NOGO receptor NgR2, a novel αVβ3 integrin effector, induces neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer.', 'Small extracellular vesicle-mediated ITGB6 siRNA delivery downregulates the αVβ6 integrin and inhibits adhesion and migration of recipient prostate cancer cells.', 'αvβ6 Integrin Promotes Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer through JNK1-Mediated Activation of Androgen Receptor.', 'The roles of integrin αvβ6 in cancer.', 'Defining the role of integrin alphavbeta6 in cancer.', 'Defining cellular population dynamics at single-cell resolution during prostate cancer progression.', 'The NOGO receptor NgR2, a novel αVβ3 integrin effector, induces neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer.', 'Targeting Integrins for Cancer Therapy - Disappointments and Opportunities.', 'Small extracellular vesicle-mediated ITGB6 siRNA delivery downregulates the αVβ6 integrin and inhibits adhesion and migration of recipient prostate cancer cells.', 'Prostate gland as a target organ of thyroid hormones: advances and controversies.']"""

Systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis lead to a heightened risk for hematological malignancies and decreased risk for breast, ovarian, and prostate malignancies. Often patients with autoimmune disease have dysregulated antiviral immune responses, including against oncogenic viruses. To uncover the relationship between viral incidence and cancer risk in the context of autoimmune disease, we extracted electronic health records (EHR) from Vanderbilt University. ICD-9/10 codes and laboratory values were collected for hematological, lung, anal-vaginal, thyroid, hepatobiliary, bladder, prostate, and breast cancers; and viruses including Epstein Barr virus (EBV), Human papilloma virus (HPV), and Hepatitis A/B/C (Hep). Only viral infections that led to a physician visit or laboratory test were entered into the EMR; therefore, only clinically relevant cases were noted and considered positive in this study. The relationship between virus infection and cancer in an SLE cohort (SLE-cases n = 2,313, and SLE-controls n = 5,702) and an MS cohort (MS-case n = 7,277, MS-control n = 7,277) was examined by multilinear logistic regression. Viral infection was strongly associated with increased risk for cancer overall. SLE and MS patients were more susceptible to all viral infections. MS patients trended toward increased risk for cancers overall, while decreased risk for hormone-based cancers in SLE patients non-significantly reduced their risk for overall cancer. Both SLE and MS patients had increased clinically relevant EBV infection, which was associated with risk for hematological cancers. Preventing viral infections by vaccination may be especially helpful in controlling risk for cancer in SLE and MS patients.""","""['Deborah K Johnson', 'Kaylia M Reynolds', 'Brian D Poole', 'Matthew D Montierth', 'Vera M Todd', 'April Barnado', 'Mary F Davis']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Real-Time PCR of cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus in adult Egyptian patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.', 'EBV and Autoimmunity.', 'Systemic lupus erythematosus in adults is associated with previous Epstein-Barr virus exposure.', 'Acute viral infections in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: description of 23 cases and review of the literature.', 'High prevalence of immunoglobulin A antibody against Epstein-Barr virus capsid antigen in adult patients with lupus with disease flare: case control studies.', 'Multiple sclerosis and breast cancer risk: a meta-analysis of observational and Mendelian randomization studies.', 'Outcomes and Health Care Service Use in Adults 50 Years or Older With and Without Multiple Sclerosis: A 6-Year Observational Analysis.', 'Risk of cervical pre-cancer and cancer in women with multiple sclerosis exposed to high efficacy disease modifying therapies.', 'Hematological malignancies in systemic lupus erythematosus: clinical characteristics, risk factors, and prognosis-a case-control study.']"""

Methods:   Two rectal cancer patients (one male and one female) underwent hydrogel implant between rectum and vagina/prostate before nCRT and curative surgery. A CT scan was performed before and after injection and a comparative dosimetric study was performed testing a standard (45/50 Gy) and a dose escalated (46/55.2 Gy) schedule.  Results:   In both patients, the spacer implant in the recto-prostatic or recto-vaginal space was feasible and well tolerated. For the male, the dosimetric benefit with spacer was minimal for sexual organs. For the female however, doses delivered to the vagina were significantly reduced with spacer with a mean reduction of more than 5 Gy for both regimens.  Conclusions:   For organ preservation protocols and selected sexually active female patients, use of hydrogel spacers can be considered to spare sexual organs from the high radiotherapy dose levels.

Methods:   50 consecutive patients who underwent [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT for recurrent prostate cancer were selected for this retrospective study. The scans were randomised, anonymised and read by five different readers first in the visually nonlinear colour scale 'PET-rainbow'. Scans were then rerandomised and read in the visually linear colour scale 'hot-metal new'. For each scan in each colour scale the numbers of pathological, equivocal and benign lesions were noted. Scans where the majority of readers (≥3) reported at least one PET-positive lesion were recorded as 'pathological'. Patient-level sensitivity was obtained by composite standard with 14.8 ± 1.2 months of follow-up.  Results:   Increased numbers of lesions per patient were reported for all readers in PET-rainbow compared to hot-metal new (37.4 ± 15.2 vs. 33.9 ± 16.4, respectively, P = 0.0005). On a per-patient basis, 43 scans were rated pathological in PET-rainbow, compared to 39 in hot-metal new. Follow-up was available for 30 patients confirming 26 pathological scans with positive follow-up in PET-rainbow, and 23 in hot-metal new. Three pathological scans were missed in hot-metal new. Patient-level sensitivity was higher for PET-rainbow (0.96) compared to hot-metal new (0.85). Inter-reader reliability was higher for hot-metal new (Fleiss κ = 0.76) compared to PET-rainbow (Fleiss κ = 0.60).  Conclusion:   Use of PET-rainbow was associated with improved lesion detection and sensitivity compared to hot-metal new, although at cost of reduced inter-rater agreement.

Despite their many benefits, RCTs have limitations, such as costliness, that may reduce the generalizability of their findings among diverse populations and routine care settings.  Objective:   To assess the performance of an RCT-derived prognostic model that predicts survival among patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) when the model is applied to real-world data from electronic health records (EHRs).  Design, setting, and participants:   The RCT-trained model and patient data from the RCTs were obtained from the Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) challenge for prostate cancer, which occurred from March 16 to July 27, 2015. This challenge included 4 phase 3 clinical trials of patients with metastatic CRPC. Real-world data were obtained from the EHRs of a tertiary care academic medical center that includes a comprehensive cancer center. In this study, the DREAM challenge RCT-trained model was applied to real-world data from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2019; the model was then retrained using EHR data with optimized feature selection. Patients with metastatic CRPC were divided into RCT and EHR cohorts based on data source. Data were analyzed from March 23, 2018, to October 22, 2020.  Exposures:   Patients who received treatment for metastatic CRPC.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcome was the performance of an RCT-derived prognostic model that predicts survival among patients with metastatic CRPC when the model is applied to real-world data. Model performance was compared using 10-fold cross-validation according to time-dependent integrated area under the curve (iAUC) statistics.  Results:   Among 2113 participants with metastatic CRPC, 1600 participants were included in the RCT cohort, and 513 participants were included in the EHR cohort. The RCT cohort comprised a larger proportion of White participants (1390 patients [86.9%] vs 337 patients [65.7%]) and a smaller proportion of Hispanic participants (14 patients [0.9%] vs 42 patients [8.2%]), Asian participants (41 patients [2.6%] vs 88 patients [17.2%]), and participants older than 75 years (388 patients [24.3%] vs 191 patients [37.2%]) compared with the EHR cohort. Participants in the RCT cohort also had fewer comorbidities (mean [SD], 1.6 [1.8] comorbidities vs 2.5 [2.6] comorbidities, respectively) compared with those in the EHR cohort. Of the 101 variables used in the RCT-derived model, 10 were not available in the EHR data set, 3 of which were among the top 10 features in the DREAM challenge RCT model. The best-performing EHR-trained model included only 25 of the 101 variables included in the RCT-trained model. The performance of the RCT-trained and EHR-trained models was adequate in the EHR cohort (mean [SD] iAUC, 0.722 [0.118] and 0.762 [0.106], respectively); model optimization was associated with improved performance of the best-performing EHR model (mean [SD] iAUC, 0.792 [0.097]). The EHR-trained model classified 256 patients as having a high risk of mortality and 256 patients as having a low risk of mortality (hazard ratio, 2.7; 95% CI, 2.0-3.7; log-rank P < .001).  Conclusions and relevance:   In this study, although the RCT-trained models did not perform well when applied to real-world EHR data, retraining the models using real-world EHR data and optimizing variable selection was beneficial for model performance. As clinical evidence evolves to include more real-world data, both industry and academia will likely search for ways to balance model optimization with generalizability. This study provides a pragmatic approach to applying RCT-trained models to real-world data.""","""['Jean Coquet', 'Nicolas Bievre', 'Vincent Billaut', 'Martin Seneviratne', 'Christopher J Magnani', 'Selen Bozkurt', 'James D Brooks', 'Tina Hernandez-Boussard']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Building Predictive Models for Clinical Care-Where to Build and What to Predict?', 'Prediction of overall survival for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: development of a prognostic model through a crowdsourced challenge with open clinical trial data.', 'Overall Survival in Men With Bone Metastases From Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Treated With Bone-Targeting Radioisotopes: A Meta-analysis of Individual Patient Data From Randomized Clinical Trials.', 'Differences in Trial and Real-world Populations in the Dutch Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Registry.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Comparative efficacy, tolerability, and survival outcomes of various radiopharmaceuticals in castration-resistant prostate cancer with bone metastasis: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.', 'Real-World Sarilumab Use and Rule Testing to Predict Treatment Response in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis: Findings from the RISE Registry.', 'Machine learning in metastatic cancer research: Potentials, possibilities, and prospects.', 'Replication of Real-World Evidence in Oncology Using Electronic Health Record Data Extracted by Machine Learning.', 'Machine Learning Applied to Electronic Health Records: Identification of Chemotherapy Patients at High Risk for Preventable Emergency Department Visits and Hospital Admissions.', 'Prognostic Association between Common Laboratory Tests and Overall Survival in Elderly Men with De Novo Metastatic Castration Sensitive Prostate Cancer: A Population-Based Study in Canada.']"""

In addition, alterations in RGS protein expression have been observed in a number of disease states, including certain cancers. In this area, RGS17 is of particular interest. It has been demonstrated that, while RGS17 is expressed primarily in the central nervous system, it has been found to be inappropriately expressed in lung, prostate, breast, cervical, and hepatocellular carcinomas. Overexpression of RGS17 leads to dysfunction in inhibitory G protein signaling and an overproduction of the intracellular second messenger cAMP, which in turn alters the transcription patterns of proteins known to promote various cancer types. Suppressing RGS17 expression with RNA interference (RNAi) has been found to decrease tumorigenesis and sufficiently prevents cancer cell migration, leading to the hypothesis that pharmacological blocking of RGS17 function could be useful in anticancer therapies. We have identified small-molecule fragments capable of binding the RGS homology (RH) domain of RGS17 by using a nuclear magnetic resonance fragment-based screening approach. By chemical shift mapping of the two-dimensional 15 N,1 H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of the backbone-assigned 15 N-labeled RGS17-RH, we determined the fragment binding sites to be distant from the Gα interface. Thus, our study identifies a putative fragment binding site on RGS17 that was previously unknown.""","""['Michael P Hayes', ""Joseph B O'Brien"", 'Rachel A Crawford', 'C Andrew Fowler', 'Liping Yu', 'Jonathan A Doorn', 'David L Roman']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Chembiochem""","""['Regulator of G Protein Signaling 17 as a Negative Modulator of GPCR Signaling in Multiple Human Cancers.', 'Development of a novel high-throughput screen and identification of small-molecule inhibitors of the Gα-RGS17 protein-protein interaction using AlphaScreen.', 'High-resolution structure of RGS17 suggests a role for Ca2+ in promoting the GTPase-activating protein activity by RZ subfamily members.', 'Screen Targeting Lung and Prostate Cancer Oncogene Identifies Novel Inhibitors of RGS17 and Problematic Chemical Substructures.', 'RGS17/RGSZ2 and the RZ/A family of regulators of G-protein signaling.']"""

The surrounding stroma contains multiple functionally diverse populations of fibroblasts that trigger numerous changes in PCa cells including motility. Thus, we hypothesized that direct or indirect contact of PCa cells with fibroblasts determines an invasive phenotype in PCa cells. We investigated the effects of 10 different patient-derived fibroblast lines on the three-dimensional (3D) morphogenesis of PCa cells growing on a viscous substrate in vitro. When grown alone, all 10 patient-derived fibroblast lines clumped on the viscous substrate, whereas the human androgen-sensitive PCa cell line LNCaP did not. Cocultures of LNCaP cells with seven of the patient-derived fibroblast lines (PrSC, pcPrF-M5, pcPrF-M7, pcPrF-M23, pcPrF-M24, pcPrF-M28, and pcPrF-M31) formed a thick fibroblast layer that resembled human prostate stromal structures. In contrast, cocultures of LNCaP cells with the remaining three fibroblast lines (NPF-M13, pcPrF-M10, and pcPrF-M26) did not form a thick fibroblast layer. Of the seven fibroblast lines that caused thick layer formation, four patient-derived fibroblast lines (PrSC, pcPrF-M5, pcPrF-M28, and pcPrF-M31) induced an invasive phenotype in LNCaP cells with a cord-like infiltrating growth pattern, whereas the other three fibroblast lines (pcPrF-M7, pcPrF-M23, and pcPrF-M24) induced no or a very weak invasive phenotype. Using cell culture inserts, none of the four patient-derived fibroblast lines that induced an invasive phenotype (PrSC, pcPrF-M5, pcPrF-M28, and pcPrF-M31) affected CDH1 mRNA expression in LNCaP cells; yet, two patient-derived fibroblast lines (pcPrF-M5 and pcPrF-M28) increased CDH2 mRNA expression in LNCaP cells, whereas the other two fibroblast lines (PrSC and pcPrF-M31) did not.

All new peptides were prepared by solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), purified and characterized by HPLC and LC-MS. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) contain a considerably high ratio of positively charged amino acids, imparting them with cationic character. Tumor cells are characterized by an increased anionic nature of their membrane surface, a property that could be used by CPP to target these cells. The BxPC-3, MCF-7 and PC-3 cancer cell lines were used to evaluate the in vitro cytotoxicity of conjugates and the results showed that conjugating dFdC with CPP6 significantly enhanced cell growth inhibitory activity on PC-3 cells, with IC50 between 14 and 15 nM.

Methods:   Data regarding prostate cancer incidence and mortality for East London between 2008 and 2010 were obtained from the UK National Disease Registration Service. We further evaluated survival outcomes of 425 cases of mCRPC in St Bartholomew's Hospital, East London, between 1997 and 2016, and analyzed whether ethnicity impacted on responses to different treatment types.  Results:   The incidence of prostate cancer in black men was higher than white men in East London. Prostate cancer-specific mortality was proportional to incidence based on ethnic groups. In the detailed analysis of 425 patients, 103 patients (24%) were black (B), and the remainder white (W). Baseline characteristics were comparable in both groups, although black patients had a lower baseline hemoglobin (p < 0.001). Median overall survival for the total cohort was 25.5 months (B) vs 21.8 months (W) (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.81, p = 0.08).

These stem cells are quiescent in nature and rarely divide to self-renew and give rise to tissue-specific ""progenitors"" (lineage-restricted and tissue-committed) which divide rapidly and differentiate into tissue-specific cell types. However, it has proved difficult to isolate these quiescent stem cells as a physical entity. Recent single-cell RNAseq studies on several adult tissues including ovary, prostate, and cardiac tissues have not been able to detect stem cells. Thus, it has been postulated that adult cells dedifferentiate to stem-like state to ensure regeneration and can be defined as cells capable to replace lost cells through mitosis. This idea challenges basic paradigm of development biology regarding plasticity that a cell enters point of no return once it initiates differentiation. The underlying reason for this dilemma is that we are putting stem cells and somatic cells together while processing for various studies. Stem cells and adult mature cell types are distinct entities; stem cells are quiescent, small in size, and with minimal organelles whereas the mature cells are metabolically active and have multiple organelles lying in abundant cytoplasm. As a result, they do not pellet down together when centrifuged at 100-350g. At this speed, mature cells get collected but stem cells remain buoyant and can be pelleted by centrifuging at 1000g. Thus, inability to detect stem cells in recently published single-cell RNAseq studies is because the stem cells were unknowingly discarded while processing and were never subjected to RNAseq. This needs to be kept in mind before proposing to redefine adult stem cells.""","""['Deepa Bhartiya']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Stem Cell Res Ther""","""['Endogenous, very small embryonic-like stem cells: critical review, therapeutic potential and a look ahead.', 'Novel Insights into Adult and Cancer Stem Cell Biology.', 'Ovary does harbor stem cells - size of the cells matter!', 'Existence of reserve quiescent stem cells in adults, from amphibians to humans.', 'Phenotypic plasticity of neural crest-derived melanocytes and Schwann cells.', 'Cysteine-rich intestinal protein 1 is a novel surface marker for human myometrial stem/progenitor cells.', 'Application of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound on tissue resident stem cells: Potential for ophthalmic diseases.', 'Cysteine-Rich Intestinal Protein 1 is a Novel Surface Marker for Myometrial Stem/Progenitor Cells.', 'Stemming Tumoral Growth: A Matter of Grotesque Organogenesis.', 'Comparative transcriptomics reveals circadian and pluripotency networks as two pillars of longevity regulation.']"""

Weakly supervised methods are then chosen to lighten the workload, which only needs physicians to determine whether an image contains the organ regions of interest. These weakly supervised methods have a common drawback, in that they do not incorporate prior knowledge that alleviates the lack of pixel-level information for segmentation.

Their cytotoxicity was determined against the A2780 (ovarian), MCF7 (breast) and PC3 (prostate) human cancer cells at different incubation times. While at 3 and 24 h the cytotoxicity differs for complexes and corresponding free ligands, at 72 h incubation all compounds are equally active presenting low IC50 values. Upon incubation of A2780 cells with 1-3, cellular distribution of vanadium in cytosol, membranes, nucleus and cytoskeleton, indicate that the uptake of V is low, particularly for 1, and that the uptake pattern depends on the ligand. Nuclear microscopic techniques are used for imaging and elemental quantification in whole PC3 cells incubated with 1.

This study emphasizes that for these VIVO-systems, and probably for many others involving oxidovanadium or other labile metal complexes, it is not possible to identify active species or propose mechanisms of cytotoxic action without evaluating speciation occurring in cell media.""","""['Patrique Nunes', 'Isabel Correia', 'Isabel Cavaco', 'Fernanda Marques', 'Teresa Pinheiro', 'Fernando Avecilla', 'João Costa Pessoa']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Inorg Biochem""","""['High cytotoxicity of vanadium(IV) complexes with 1,10-phenanthroline and related ligands is due to decomposition in cell culture medium.', 'Exploring the cytotoxic activity of new phenanthroline salicylaldimine Zn(II) complexes.', 'Copper Complexes with 1,10-Phenanthroline Derivatives: Underlying Factors Affecting Their Cytotoxicity.', 'Vanadium complexes with polypyridyl ligands: Speciation, structure and potential medicinal activity.', 'Overview of Research on Vanadium-Quercetin Complexes with a Historical Outline.', 'Cu(II) and Zn(II) Complexes of New 8-Hydroxyquinoline Schiff Bases: Investigating Their Structure, Solution Speciation, and Anticancer Potential.', 'A Series of Non-Oxido VIV Complexes of Dibasic ONS Donor Ligands: Solution Stability, Chemical Transformations, Protein Interactions, and Antiproliferative Activity.', 'Advantageous Reactivity of Unstable Metal Complexes: Potential Applications of Metal-Based Anticancer Drugs for Intratumoral Injections.', 'Synthesis, Characterization, and Biological Activities of Novel Vanadium(IV) and Cobalt(II) Complexes.', 'Copper(II) and oxidovanadium(IV) complexes of chromone Schiff bases as potential anticancer agents.']"""

Cell count, MTT and soft agar colony formation assays were performed to evaluate cell proliferation. qRT-PCR was applied to determine the mRNA levels of U2AF1, ARV7 and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1 (MAPK1). Western blot was used to determine the MAPK1 protein expression. A negative correlation between ARV7 and U2AF1 in prostate tumor tissues was observed. U2AF1 downregulation was correlated with poor prognosis in prostate cancer patients. U2AF1 exhibited a negative correlation with ARV7 and its downregulation promoted prostate cancer cell proliferation and bicalutamide resistance.

Compound 3 is new, while 1 and 2 are being reported for the first time in this species. Structures were determined by 1D- and 2D-NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and optical rotation data. Cytotoxic effects and selectivity indices were evaluated in five neoplastic cell lines-PC-3 (prostate), 786-0 (renal), HT-29 (colon), MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231 (breast)-and a non-neoplastic cell line, (NIH/3T3, murine fibroblast). Compound 1 inhibited cell growth by 50% (GI50) at concentrations in the 90.4-175.7 μM range, while 2 proved active against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cells (GI50 = 12.24, and 34.22 μM, respectively). Compound 3 showed strong cytotoxicity (GI50 = 4.4 μM) against MDA-MB-231 (an established basal triple-negative breast carcinoma (TNBC) cell line), with a high selective index of 35. This compound was subsequently evaluated for apoptosis induction in MDA-MB-231 cells, using GI50 and 50% lethal concentrations (LC50). Flow cytometry analysis showed that at LC50 compound 3 induced cell death with phosphatidylserine externalization and caspase-3 activation. Apoptotic genes were measured by RT-qPCR, revealing an upregulation of BAX, with an increase in expression of the BAX/BCL2 ratio in treated cells.

Objective:   To identify prognostic factors associated with dying within 3 mo, or living greater than 3 yr, following spine SBRT, to better inform patient selection.  Methods:   Patients living ≤3 mo after spine SBRT and >3 yr after spine SBRT were identified, and multivariable regression analyses were performed. We report serious late toxicities observed, including vertebral compression fractures (VCF) and plexopathy.  Results:   A total of 605 patients (1406 spine segments) were treated from 2009 to 2018. A total of 51 patients (8.4%) lived ≤3 mo, and 79 patients (13%) survived >3 yr. Significant differences in baseline features were observed. On multivariable analysis, nonbreast/prostate primaries (odds ratio [ORs]: 28.8-104.2, P = .0004), eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) ≥2 (OR: 23.7, 95% CI: 3.2-177, P = .0020), polymetastatic disease (OR: 6.715, 95% CI: 1.89-23.85, P = .0032), painful lesions (OR: 3.833-8.898, P = .0118), and paraspinal disease (OR: 2.874, 95% CI: 1.118-7.393, P = .0288) were prognostic for ≤3 mo survival. The 3- and 5-yr rates of VCF were 10.4% and 14.4%, respectively, and 3- and 5-yr rates of plexopathy were 2.2% and 5.1%, respectively. A single duodenal perforation was observed, and there was no radiation myelopathy events.  Conclusion:   Shorter survival after spine SBRT was seen in patients with less radiosensitive histologies (ie, not breast or prostate), ECOG ≥2, and polymetastatic disease.

In this study, we investigated possibilities to improve treatment plans for MLC-based prostate SBRT with enhanced peripheral zone dose while sparing the urethra, and central lung tumors, compared to existing Sequential Optimization (SO). The primary focus was on reducing OAR doses. For 25 prostate and 25 lung patients treated with SO plans, replanning with VOLO™ was performed with the same planning constraints. For equal PTV coverage, almost all OAR plan parameters were improved with VOLO™. For prostate patients, mean rectum and bladder doses were reduced by 34.2% (P < 0.001) and 23.5% (P < 0.001), with reductions in D0.03cc of 3.9%, 11.0% and 3.1% for rectum, mucosa and bladder (all P ≤ 0.01).

Pathologic parameters have limited ability to predict these outcomes, but biomarkers can improve risk discrimination. We evaluated the ability of cell-cycle progression and combined cell-cycle risk scores to predict metastases and disease-specific mortality after prostatectomy.  Methods:   Eligibility included (1) treatment with radical prostatectomy (1985-1997); (2) cell-cycle progression score; (3) preoperative prostate-specific antigen; (4) no neoadjuvant therapy; and (5) clinical follow-up (N = 360). Cancer of the prostate risk assessment postsurgical score was combined with cell cycle progression into the prespecified combined cell-cycle risk score. Hazard ratios (HRs) are reported per unit score.  Results:   In total, 11% (41/360) developed metastases and 9% (33/360) experienced disease-specific mortality. Combined cell-cycle risk score predicted metastases and disease-specific mortality post-radical prostatectomy (p < 1 × 10-8 ). Adjusting for cancer of the prostate risk assessment postsurgical score, the combined cell-cycle risk score remained a predictor of metastases (HR = 3.03 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.49, 6.20]; p = .003] and disease-specific mortality (HR = 3.40 [95% CI: 1.52, 7.59]; p = .004). Of patients with biochemical recurrence, 25% (41/163) developed metastases. Cancer of the prostate risk assessment postsurgical score was predictive of metastases postbiochemical recurrence but was improved by the addition of cell cycle progression (HR = 1.70 [95% CI: 1.14, 2.53]; p = .012). The combined cell-cycle risk was also prognostic of metastases post-biochemical recurrence (HR = 1.56 [95% CI: 1.20, 2.03]; p = .001).

We investigated the optimal aperture shape controller (ASC) level for the KBP to reduce these factors in volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for prostate cancer.  Methods:   The KBP model was created based on 51 clinical plans (CPs) of patients who underwent the VMAT for prostate cancer. Another 10 CPs were selected randomly, and the KBPs with/without ASC, changed stepwise from very low (KBP-VL) to very high (KBP-VH), were performed with a single auto-optimization. The parameters of dose-volume histograms (DVHs) and MLC performance metrics were evaluated. We obtained the modulation complexity score for VMAT (MCSv), closed leaf score (CLS), small aperture score (SAS), leaf travel (LT), and total MU.  Results:   The ASC did not affect the DVH parameters negatively. The following comparisons of MLC performance were obtained (KBP vs. KBP-VL vs. KBP-VH, respectively): 0.25 vs. 0.27 vs. 0.30 (MCSv), 0.19 vs. 0.18 vs. 0.16 (CLS), 0.50 vs. 0.45 vs. 0.40 (SAS10 mm), 0.73 vs. 0.68 vs. 0.63 (SAS20 mm), 768.35 mm vs. 671.50 mm vs. 551.32 mm (LT), and 672.87 vs. 642.36 vs. 607.59 (MU). There were significant differences between KBP and KBP-VH for MCSv and LT (p<0.05).

Patients who underwent systematic 12-core prostate biopsies in Shanghai General Hospital (Shanghai, China) between January 2012 and January 2018 were retrospectively identified (n = 529). Another group of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (n = 100) were randomly preselected to obtain the PSA density of the non-PCa cohort (N-PSAD). Prostate volumes and transition zone volumes were measured using multiparameter magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and were combined with PSA and N-PSAD to obtain the PZ-PSAD from a specific algorithm. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess the PCa detection efficiency in patients stratified by PSA level, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of PZ-PSAD was higher than that of PSA, PSA density (PSAD), and transition zone PSA density (TZ-PSAD). PZ-PSAD could amend the diagnosis for more than half of the patients with inaccurate transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) and mpMRI results. When TRUS and mpMRI findings were ambiguous to predict PCa (PIRADS score ≤3), PZ-PSAD could increase the positive rate of biopsy from 21.7% to 54.7%, and help 63.8% (150/235) of patients avoid unnecessary prostate biopsy. In patients whose PSA was 4.0-10.0 ng ml-1, 10.1-20.0 ng ml-1, and >20.0 ng ml-1, the ideal PZ-PSAD cut-off value for predicting clinically significant PCa was 0.019 ng ml-2, 0.297 ng ml-2, and 1.180 ng ml-2, respectively (sensitivity >90%).

Methods:   A total of 102 consecutive (January 2016-September 2019) patients who underwent abdominopelvic CT with prostate cancer were retrospectively evaluated for osteoblastic pelvic bone lesions, using commercially available the post-processing-pelvic bone flattening-image software package ""CT Bone Unfolding."" Two radiologists with 3 and 15 years of experience in abdominal radiology evaluated CT image data sets independently in 2 separate reading sessions. At the first session, only MPR images and at the second session MPR images and additionally unfolded reconstructions were assessed. Reading time for each patient was noted. A radiologist with 25 years of experience, established the standard of reference.  Results:   In the evaluations performed with the MPR-Unfold method, the diagnostic accuracy were found to be 2.067 times higher compared to the MPRs method (P < 0.001). The location of the lesions or the reader variabilities did not show any influence on accuracy (P > 0.05) For all readers the reading time for MPR was significantly longer than for MPR-Unfold (P < 0.05). For both methods substantial to almost-perfect inter-reader agreement was found (0.686-0.936).  Conclusions:   The use of unfolded pelvic bone reconstructions increases diagnostic accuracy while decreasing the reading times in the evaluation of pelvic bone lesions. Therefore, our findings suggest that utilizing unfolded reconstructions in addition to MPR images may be preferable in patients with prostate cancer for the screening of osteoblastic pelvic bone lesions.""","""['Mahinur Cerit', 'Koray Kılıç', 'Turkane Fetullayeva', 'Hatice Yağmur Zengin', 'Nesrin Erdoğan', 'Halit Nahit Şendur', 'Emetullah Cindil', 'Aydan Avdan Aslan', 'Gonca Erbaş']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Can Assoc Radiol J""","""['Effect of Bone Reading CT software on radiologist performance in detecting bone metastases from breast cancer.', 'Improved Detection of Benign and Malignant Rib Lesions in the Routine Computed Tomography Workup of Oncological Patients Using Automated Unfolded Rib Image Postprocessing.', 'Improved detection of bone metastases from lung cancer in the thoracic cage using 5- and 1-mm axial images versus a new CT software generating rib unfolding images: comparison with standard ¹⁸F-FDG-PET/CT.', 'Osteoblastic lesion screening with an advanced post-processing package enabling in-plane rib reading in CT-images.', 'Clinical utility of virtual noncalcium dual-energy CT in imaging of the pelvis and hip.']"""

Our study was designed to determine the effect of cabozantinib, a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits VEGFR2, MET and RET on SCNPC. Transcriptome analysis of the University of Washington rapid autopsy and SU2C mCRPC datasets revealed upregulated MET and RET expression in SCNPCs relative to adenocarcinomas. Additionally, increased MET expression correlated with attenuated AR expression and activity. In vitro treatment of SCNPC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cells with the MET inhibitor AMG-337 had no impact on cell viability in LuCaP 93 (MET+/RET+) and LuCaP 173.1 (MET-/RET-), whereas cabozantinib decreased cell viability of LuCaP 93, but not LuCaP 173.1. Notably, MET+/RET+ LuCaP 93 and MET-/RET- LuCaP 173.1 tumor volumes were significantly decreased with cabozantinib treatment in vivo, and this activity was independent of MET or RET expression in LuCaP 173.1. Tissue analysis indicated that cabozantinib did not inhibit tumor cell proliferation (Ki67), but significantly decreased microvessel density (CD31) and increased hypoxic stress and glycolysis (HK2) in LuCaP 93 and LuCaP 173.1 tumors. RNA-Seq and gene set enrichment analysis revealed that hypoxia and glycolysis pathways were increased in cabozantinib-treated tumors relative to control tumors. Our data suggest that the most likely mechanism of cabozantinib-mediated tumor growth suppression in SCNPC PDX models is through disruption of the tumor vasculature. Thus, cabozantinib may represent a potential therapy for patients with metastatic disease in tumor phenotypes that have a significant dependence on the tumor vasculature for survival and proliferation.""","""['Mark P Labrecque', 'Lisha G Brown', 'Ilsa M Coleman', 'Holly M Nguyen', 'Daniel W Lin', 'Eva Corey', 'Peter S Nelson', 'Colm Morrissey']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['In vitro and in vivo activity of cabozantinib (XL184), an inhibitor of RET, MET, and VEGFR2, in a model of medullary thyroid cancer.', 'Integrating Murine and Clinical Trials with Cabozantinib to Understand Roles of MET and VEGFR2 as Targets for Growth Inhibition of Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting RET Kinase in Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'Cabozantinib: a MET, RET, and VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor.', 'Cabozantinib for the treatment of progressive metastatic medullary thyroid cancer.', 'Aiding Cancer\'s ""Sweet Tooth"": Role of Hexokinases in Metabolic Reprogramming.', '3D Ultrasound-Guided Photoacoustic Imaging to Monitor the Effects of Suboptimal Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Therapy in Pancreatic Tumors.']"""

Methods:   We surveyed randomly selected members of the American Academy of Family Practice, Endocrine Society, and American Geriatrics Society. Respondents were asked to rate how often they would screen for osteoporosis in four different clinical scenarios by ordering a bone density scan. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine factors associated with offering osteoporosis screening in men in each clinical scenario. Physicians were also asked to note factors that would lead to osteoporosis screening in men.  Results:   Response rate was 63% (359/566). While 90% respondents reported that they would always or frequently screen for osteoporosis in a 65-year-old post-menopausal woman, only 22% reported they would screen a 74-year-old man with no significant past medical history. Endocrinologists were more likely to screen a 74-year-old man compared to primary care physicians (odds ratio, 2.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.10 to 4.88). In addition to chronic steroid use (94%), history of nontraumatic fractures (88%), and androgen-deprivation therapy for prostate cancer (82%), more than half the physicians reported suppressive doses of thyroid hormone (64%) and history of falls (52%) as factors leading to screening for osteoporosis in men.

Patients and methods:   In the phase III, multicenter, randomized controlled Focal Lesion Ablative Microboost in Prostate Cancer trial, 571 patients with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer were enrolled between 2009 and 2015. Patients assigned to standard treatment received 77 Gy (fractions of 2.2 Gy) to the entire prostate. The focal boost arm received an additional simultaneous integrated focal boost up to 95 Gy (fractions up to 2.7 Gy) to the intraprostatic lesion visible on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging. Organ at risk constraints were prioritized over the focal boost dose. The primary end point was 5-year bDFS. Secondary end points were disease-free survival (DFS), distant metastases-free survival, prostate cancer-specific survival, overall survival, toxicity, and health-related quality of life.  Results:   Median follow-up was 72 months. Biochemical DFS was significantly higher in the focal boost compared with the standard arm (hazard ratio 0.45, 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.71, P < .001). At 5-year follow-up bDFS was 92% and 85%, respectively. We did not observe differences in prostate cancer-specific survival (P = .49) and overall survival (P = .50). The cumulative incidence of late genitourinary and GI toxicity grade ≥ 2 was 23% and 12% in the standard arm versus 28% and 13% in the focal boost arm, respectively. Both for late toxicity as health-related quality of life, differences were small and not statistically significant.  Conclusion:   The addition of a focal boost to the intraprostatic lesion improved bDFS for patients with localized intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer without impacting toxicity and quality of life. The Focal Lesion Ablative Microboost in Prostate Cancer study shows that a high focal boost strategy to improve tumor control while respecting organ at risk dose constraints is effective and safe.""","""['Linda G W Kerkmeijer', 'Veerle H Groen', 'Floris J Pos', 'Karin Haustermans', 'Evelyn M Monninkhof', 'Robert Jan Smeenk', 'Martina Kunze-Busch', 'Johannes C J de Boer', 'Jochem van der Voort van Zijp', 'Marco van Vulpen', 'Cédric Draulans', 'Laura van den Bergh', 'Sofie Isebaert', 'Uulke A van der Heide']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Reply to I.

Hence, targeting the lipogenesis pathway may be a potential avenue for cancer treatment. Valproic acid (VPA) emerges as a promising drug for cancer therapy; however, the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of VPA on cell viability, lipogenesis, and apoptosis in human prostate cancer PC-3 and LNCaP cells. The results showed that VPA significantly reduced lipid accumulation and induced apoptosis of PC-3 and LNCaP cells. Moreover, the expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα), as well as sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) and its downstream effectors, including fatty acid synthase (FASN), acetyl CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), and anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), was markedly decreased in PC-3 and LNCaP cells after VPA administration. Mechanistically, the overexpression of C/EBPα rescued the levels of SREBP-1, FASN, ACC1, and Bcl-2, enhanced lipid accumulation, and attenuated apoptosis of VPA-treated PC-3 cells. Conversely, knockdown of C/EBPα by siRNA further decreased lipid accumulation, enhanced apoptosis, and reduced the levels of SREBP-1, FASN, ACC1, and Bcl-2. In addition, SREBP-1a and 1c enhanced the expressions of FASN and ACC1, but only SREBP-1a had a significant effect on Bcl-2 expression in VPA-treated PC-3 cells. Based on the results, we concluded that VPA significantly inhibits cell viability via decreasing lipogenesis and inducing apoptosis via the C/EBPα/SREBP-1 pathway in prostate cancer cells.

Objective:   To describe patient-reported urinary outcomes following radical prostatectomy in the diverse practice settings of a statewide quality improvement program and to explore whether surgeon-specific variations in observed outcomes persist after accounting for patient-level factors.  Design, setting, and participants:   This prospective population-based cohort study included 4582 men in the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative who underwent radical prostatectomy as primary management of localized prostate cancer between April 2014 and July 2018 and who agreed to complete validated questionnaires prior to surgery and at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. Data were analyzed from 2019 to June 2019.  Exposures:   Radical prostatectomy.  Main outcomes and measures:   Patient- and surgeon-level analyses of patient-reported urinary function 3 months after radical prostatectomy. Outcomes were measured using validated questionnaires with results standardized using previously published methods. Urinary function survey scores are reported on a scale from 0 to 100 with good function established as a score of 74 or higher.  Results:   For the 4582 men undergoing radical prostatectomy within the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative who agreed to complete surveys, mean (SD) age was 63.3 (7.1) years. Survey response rates varied: 3791 of 4582 (83%) responded at baseline, 3282 of 4137 (79%) at 3 months, 2975 of 3770 (79%) at 6 months, and 2213 of 2882 (77%) at 12 months. Mean (SD) urinary function scores were 88.5 (14.3) at baseline, 53.6 (27.5) at 3 months, 68.0 (25.1) at 6 months, and 73.7 (23.0) at 12 months. Regression analysis demonstrated that older age, lower baseline urinary function score, body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 30 or higher, clinical stage T2 or higher, and lack of bilateral nerve-sparing surgery were associated with a lower probability of reporting good urinary function 3 months after surgery. When evaluating patients with good baseline function, the rate at which individual surgeons' patients reported good urinary function 3 months after surgery varied broadly (0% to 54.5%; P < .001).

Long noncoding RNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 1 (lncRNA SNHG1) has been reported to play a crucial role in the development of various cancers. However, the understanding of SNHG1 in prostate cancer is still limited and needs further investigation. In this study, we found the level of SNHG1 was significantly upregulated in prostate cancer tissues and cells. Knockdown of SNHG1 significantly suppressed proliferation, migration and invasion and promoted cell apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. In addition, knockdown of SNHG1 significantly downregulated proliferating cell nuclear antigen and upregulated cleaved caspase-3. MiR-383-5p was identified to be a target of SNHG1 by bioinformatics analysis, dual-luciferase reporter assay, RNA immunoprecipitation assay and RNA pull-down assay. MiR-383-5p was significantly downregulated in prostate cancer tissues and cells. Inhibition of miR-383-5p could partially restore the effects of SNHG1 knockdown on prostate cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion. Furthermore, murine xenograft models were established to investigate the effects of SNHG1 and miR-383-5p in tumorigenesis in vivo. We found SNHG1 knockdown or miR-383-5p overexpression repressed tumor growth in vivo.

Studies have demonstrated that exosomes in the tumor microenvironment contribute to prostate cancer development and progression.

Methods:   Co-culturing and exosome treatment assays combined with in vitro and in vivo assays were performed to determine the function of exosomes in the transformation of androgen-dependent prostate cancer (ADPC) cells into androgen-independent cells. Then, the mRNA expression profiles of ADPC cells and ADPC cells co-cultured with androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC) cell-derived exosomes were studied using microarrays. After silencing the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1), Western blotting, quantitative real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies, and MTS assay were used to confirm the mechanisms of exosome participation in CRPC progression.  Results:   The results showed that ADPC cells acquired tolerance for androgen deprivation due to the exosome-mediated communication between cells. AIPC cell-derived exosomes promoted the transformation of ADPC cells into androgen-independent cells in vivo and in vitro. Microarray analysis revealed that HMOX1 in ADPC cells was up-regulated after treatment with AIPC cell-derived exosomes.

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of mpMRI and MRIGB vs the regular screening pathway in a population-based prostate cancer screening setting. A micro-simulation model was used to predict the effects of regular PSA screening (men with elevated PSA followed by TRUSGB) and MRI based screening (men with elevated PSA followed by mpMRI and MRIGB). We predicted reduction of overdiagnosis, harm-benefit ratio (overdiagnosis per cancer death averted), reduction in number of biopsies, detection of clinically significant cancer, prostate cancer death averted, life-years gained (LYG), and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained for both strategies. A univariate sensitivity analysis and threshold analysis were performed to assess uncertainty around the test sensitivity parameters used in the MRI strategy.In the MRI pathway, we predicted a 43% reduction in the risk of overdiagnosis, compared to the regular pathway. Similarly a lower harm-benefit ratio (overdiagnosis per cancer death averted) was predicted for this strategy compared to the regular screening pathway (1.0 vs 1.8 respectively). Prostate cancer mortality reduction, LY and QALYs gained were also slightly increased in the MRI pathway than the regular screening pathway. Furthermore, 30% of men with a positive PSA test could avoid a biopsy as compared to the regular screening pathway.

Although the side effects of ADT can be intrusive, there is no research into the experiences of patients with pedophilic disorder themselves.  Aim:   This research aims to explore the psychological, physical, and sexual experiences of ADT from the perspective of sex offenders diagnosed with pedophilic disorder.  Methods:   Twelve semistructured in-depth interviews with male adults diagnosed with pedophilic disorder were conducted using a phenomenological approach. Six of the 12 respondents were on luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists and the remaining on anti-androgens. Half of each group were inpatients, and the other half outpatients. The respondents were recruited in collaboration with one psychiatric hospital. The data were analyzed with help of a qualitative software application NVivo.  Outcomes:   The respondents described experiences on the use of ADT on a physical, psychological, and sexual level.  Results:   The most prominent physical side effects mentioned were bone loss, weight gain, and breast formation. The respondents generally described a positive influence of the medication on their well-being. They felt more relaxed and experienced a reduction in frequency and intensity of sexual fantasies, anger, and aggressive feelings in general. In addition, all the respondents noticed a lower frequency of sexual contact and masturbation. Most of the participants experienced the use of ADT as a mandatory decision made by the treating psychiatrist.  Clinical implications:   This study recommends informing patients and their loved ones on the potential side effects of ADT. Furthermore, training forensic counselors on potential side effects of ADT and methods to alleviate them can promote the dissemination of information and will encourage the informed consent procedure.  Strengths & limitations:   This is the first qualitative study about the experiences of ADT in men diagnosed with pedophilic disorder in Belgium. Future studies should include more than one treatment center.  Conclusion:   The majority of the participants had a positive attitude towards ADT in general. Boons L, Jeandarme I, Vervaeke G.

While the first-line treatment is endoscopic, recurrences after urethrotomies require a radical approach. We present the updated results of our patient's cohort treated by pure robotic anastomosis refection.  Material and methods:   This is a retrospective, single-center study focusing on one surgeon's experience. Patients presented an urethro-vesical stricture following a radical prostatectomy. Each patient received at least one endoscopic treatment. The procedure consisted of a circumferential resection of the stenosis, followed by a re-anastomosis with well-vascularized tissue. We reviewed the outcomes in terms of symptomatic recurrences and continence after the reconstructive surgery.  Results:   From April 2013 to May 2020, 8 patients underwent this procedure. Half of the patients had previously been treated with salvage radio-hormonotherapy. The median age was 70 years (64-76). The mean operative time was 109minutes (60-180) and blood loss was 120cc (50-250). One patient had an early postoperative complication, with vesico-pubic fistula. The average length of stay was 4.6 days (3-8). Mean follow-up was 24.25 months (1-66). Half of the patients experienced a recurrence at a median time of 8.25 months (6-11) after surgery. Five patients experienced incontinence of which 3 required an artificial urinary sphincter implantation.  Conclusion:   Extra-peritoneal robot-assisted urethro-vesical reconstruction is feasible and safe to manage bladder neck stricture after radical prostatectomy. The risk of postoperative incontinence is high, justifying preoperative information.

However, there is a growing body of evidence that other targets, such as the mitochondria, could be relevant subcellular targets in Auger therapy. Thus, we developed dual-targeted 99mTc(I) tricarbonyl complexes containing a triphenylphosphonium (TPP) moiety to promote accumulation of 99mTc in the mitochondria, and a bombesin peptide to provide specificity towards the gastrin releasing peptide receptor (GRPr) overexpressed in prostate cancer cells. The designed dual-targeted complex, 99mTc-TPP-BBN, is efficiently internalized by human prostate cancer PC3 cells through a specific GRPr-mediated mechanism of uptake. Moreover, the radioconjugate provided an augmented accumulation of 99mTc in the mitochondria of the target tumor cells, most probably following its intracellular cleavage by cathepsin B.

The purpose of the present study was to assess the effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on the anticancer activities of Rh2 in human prostate cancer cells such as androgen-dependent LNCaP and androgen-independent C4-2 in vitro. The effects of treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 or Rh2, either alone or in combination, on prostate cancer cells were evaluated through tetrazolium-based cell viability assay, BrdU cell proliferation rate estimation assay, and Western blot protein expression analyses of nuclear receptors (androgen receptor and vitamin D receptors) and apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bax, and Caspase 3). The Combination Indices (CI) and Dose Reduction Indices (DRI) of 1,25(OH)2D3 and Rh2 were calculated to determine synergistic anticancer activity using Calcusyn software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). The cell viability assay data indicate that Rh2 treatment alone inhibited cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner and the addition of 10 nM 1,25(OH)2D3 to Rh2 significantly enhanced its ability to reduce cell viability up to 80 % in both the cell lines. Similarly, addition of 10 nM 1,25(OH)2D3 to Rh2 significantly lowered its IC50 values for cell proliferation from the range of 32-65 μM to 14-8 μM in LNCaP and C4-2 cells. In addition, protein expression analyses indicated that the combined treatment with Rh2 and 1,25(OH)2D3 led to greater downregulation of androgen receptor expression compared to single agent exposure. Similarly, the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3 synergistically increased the pro-apoptotic actions of Rh2 in both the cell lines. Overall, 1,25(OH)2D3 augments the Rh2-mediated anticancer effects through stimulating apoptosis and reduced cell proliferation which suggests that synergism of this combination may lead to potential lower need of the active vitamin D3 and limited toxicity from it.""","""['Mohamed Ben-Eltriki', 'Subrata Deb', 'Emma S Tomlinson Guns']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['Calcitriol and 20(S)-protopanaxadiol synergistically inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells.', '1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 inhibits prostate cancer cell growth by androgen-dependent and androgen-independent mechanisms.', 'Antiproliferative signalling by 1,25(OH)2D3 in prostate and breast cancer is suppressed by a mechanism involving histone deacetylation.', 'The role of vitamin D in prostate cancer.', 'Vitamin D and systemic cancer: is this relevant to malignant melanoma?', 'Ginsenoside Rh2 Induces HeLa Apoptosis through Upregulating Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Related and Downstream Apoptotic Gene Expression.', 'Anti-cancer effect and potential microRNAs targets of ginsenosides against breast cancer.', 'In Silico Prediction of the Metabolic Resistance of Vitamin D Analogs against CYP3A4 Metabolizing Enzyme.', 'Vitamin D Metabolites in Nonmetastatic High-Risk Prostate Cancer Patients with and without Zoledronic Acid Treatment after Prostatectomy.', 'Ginsenoside Rh2 Inhibits Glycolysis through the STAT3/c-MYC Axis in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.']"""

Activation of G protein-coupled receptors at the plasma membrane (PM) induces the translocation of G protein βγ dimers to the GA. However, the functional significance of this translocation is largely unknown. Here, we study PM-GA translocation of all 12 Gγ subunits in response to chemokine receptor CXCR4 activation and demonstrate that Gγ9 is a unique Golgi-translocating Gγ subunit. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of Gγ9 abolishes activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), two members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, by CXCR4. We show that chemically induced recruitment to the GA of Gβγ dimers containing different Gγ subunits activates ERK1/2, whereas recruitment to the PM is ineffective.

However, the extent to which key treatment modalities have been affected is unclear. We aimed to assess the impact of the pandemic on radiotherapy activity in England.  Methods:   In this population-based study, data relating to all radiotherapy delivered for cancer in the English NHS, between Feb 4, 2019, and June 28, 2020, were extracted from the National Radiotherapy Dataset. Changes in mean weekly radiotherapy courses, attendances (reflecting fractions), and fractionation patterns following the start of the UK lockdown were compared with corresponding months in 2019 overall, for specific diagnoses, and across age groups. The significance of changes in radiotherapy activity during lockdown was examined using interrupted time-series (ITS) analysis.  Findings:   In 2020, mean weekly radiotherapy courses fell by 19·9% in April, 6·2% in May, and 11·6% in June compared with corresponding months in 2019. A relatively greater fall was observed for attendances (29·1% in April, 31·4% in May, and 31·5% in June). These changes were significant on ITS analysis (p<0·0001). A greater reduction in treatment courses between 2019 and 2020 was seen for patients aged 70 years or older compared with those aged younger than 70 years (34·4% vs 7·3% in April). By diagnosis, the largest reduction from 2019 to 2020 in treatment courses was for prostate cancer (77·0% in April) and non-melanoma skin cancer (72·4% in April). Conversely, radiotherapy courses in April, 2020, compared with April, 2019, increased by 41·2% in oesophageal cancer, 64·2% in bladder cancer, and 36·3% in rectal cancer. Increased use of ultra-hypofractionated (26 Gy in five fractions) breast radiotherapy as a percentage of all courses (0·2% in April, 2019, to 60·6% in April, 2020; ITS p<0·0001) contributed to the substantial reduction in attendances.  Interpretation:   Radiotherapy activity fell significantly, but use of hypofractionated regimens rapidly increased in the English NHS during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. An increase in treatments for some cancers suggests that radiotherapy compensated for reduced surgical activity. These data will assist health-care providers in understanding the indirect consequences of the pandemic and the role of radiotherapy services in minimising these consequences.

In the present study, we prepared a derivative of 2'-HF, 16MS7F1924, and confirmed the effects of this derivative on PCa cells.  Methods:   The antiproliferation effects of 16MS7F1924 were investigated in PCa cells using LNCaP, PC-3, DU145 and docetaxel-resistant and cabazitaxel-resistant cell lines of PC-3-TxR/CxR and DU145-TxR/CxR. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and AR expression level in whole cells and the nucleus were confirmed in LNCaP by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. AR activity in LNCaP cells was confirmed by luciferase assay using PSA promoter-driven reporter. To analyze the antiproliferative effects, cell-based assays using flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, and TUNEL assay as well as Western blot analysis were employed. Furthermore, PC-3, DU145 and each chemoresistant strain of human PCa cells were subcutaneously xenografted. The antitumor effects of 16MS7F1924 were evaluated in vivo.  Results:   16MS7F1924 showed antitumor effect on all PCa cells in a dose-dependent manner. 16MS7F1924 reduced the expression of PSA messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein and inhibited AR activity in a dose-dependent manner, while expression of AR protein and mRNA was reduced by 16MS7F1924. 16MS7F1924 induced mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis. Apoptotic cells were increased in a dose-dependent manner, and the apoptosis was mediated through the Akt pathway. Tumor growth was safely and significantly inhibited by both intraperitoneal and oral administration of 16MS7F1924 in vivo.

Materials and methods:   We compared the assay results (scale 0-100) and the 4 gene group scores in biopsy specimens from 201 African American and 1,144 Caucasian American men with clinically localized prostate cancer in 6 cohorts. Adverse pathology was defined as high grade (primary Gleason pattern 4 or any pattern 5) and/or nonorgan-confined disease (≥pT3). Binary logistic regression models were used for adverse pathology. Biochemical recurrence was defined as 2 successive prostate specific antigen levels >0.2 ng/ml or initiation of salvage therapy after radical prostatectomy. Cox proportional hazards models evaluated the association of the assay result or racial group with time to biochemical recurrence.  Results:   Each cohort had different clinical risk distributions and percentages of African Americans, although median and interquartile ranges of the assay results and gene group scores were similar between both racial groups. In a multivariable model with the assay and pathological/clinical features including race, the assay was significantly associated with adverse pathology (p ≤0.004) and biochemical recurrence (p <0.001).

Precisely defining the biological role of AMPK necessitates the availability of a potent and selective inhibitor.  Methods:   High-throughput screening and chemical optimization were performed to identify a novel AMPK inhibitor. Cell proliferation and mechanistic assays, as well as gene expression analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation were used to investigate the cellular impact as well as the crosstalk between lipid metabolism and androgen signaling in prostate cancer models. Also, fatty acid turnover was determined by examining lipid droplet formation.  Results:   We identified BAY-3827 as a novel and potent AMPK inhibitor with additional activity against ribosomal 6 kinase (RSK) family members. It displays strong anti-proliferative effects in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell lines. Analysis of genes involved in AMPK signaling revealed that the expression of those encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), fatty acid synthase (FASN) and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 2 (PFKFB2), all of which are involved in lipid metabolism, was strongly upregulated by androgen in responsive models. Chromatin immunoprecipitation DNA-sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis identified several androgen receptor (AR) binding peaks in the HMGCR and PFKFB2 genes. BAY-3827 strongly down-regulated the expression of lipase E (LIPE), cAMP-dependent protein kinase type II-beta regulatory subunit (PRKAR2B) and serine-threonine kinase AKT3 in responsive prostate cancer cell lines. Also, the expression of members of the carnitine palmitoyl-transferase 1 (CPT1) family was inhibited by BAY-3827, and this was paralleled by impaired lipid flux.

The assay combines an immunoassay for the determination of the total enzyme (total prostate-specific antigen, tPSA) concentration with a protease assay for the determination of the active enzyme (free PSA, fPSA) concentration. The immunoassay label and fPSA that are affinity-bound to the electrode are used for high sensitivity and specificity in the protease assay as well as the immunoassay.

The mechanisms that balance the activities of osteoblasts and osteoclasts in PCa patients remain unclear. We unexpectedly discovered that PCa exosomes are critical mediators in the regulation of bone homeostasis that results in osteoclastic lesions and thereby promotes tumor growth in bone. We evaluated how exosomes derived from osteoblastic, osteoclastic, and mixed PCa cell lines affect osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation, revealing that all three types of PCa exosomes promoted osteoclastogenesis in vitro and induced osteolysis in vivo. Mechanistically, microRNAs (miRNAs) delivered by PCa exosomes were found to play several key roles in bone homeostasis. Among the delivered miRNAs, miR-92a-1-5p, the most abundant miRNA, downregulated type I collagen expression by directly targeting COL1A1, and thus promoting osteoclast differentiation and inhibiting osteoblastogenesis. Furthermore, PCa exosomes also markedly reduced type I collagen expression in vivo.

This may also explain the diversity of the experimental results, as co-separated soluble proteins and lipoproteins may impede the interpretation of experimental findings. In this study, we comprehensively evaluated the EV yields and sample purities of three most popular EV separation methods, ultracentrifugation, precipitation and size exclusion chromatography combined with ultrafiltration, along with a microfluidic tangential flow filtration device, Exodisc, in three commonly used biological samples, cell culture medium, human urine and plasma. Single EV phenotyping and density-gradient ultracentrifugation were used to understand the proportion of true EVs in particle separations. Our findings suggest Exodisc has the best EV yield though it may co-separate contaminants when the non-EV particle levels are high in input materials.

Chemotherapy is the primary therapeutic strategy for patients with late-stage HCC. Heteronemin is a marine natural product isolated from Hippospongia sp. that has been found to protect against carcinogenesis in cholangiocarcinoma, prostate cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia. In this study, heteronemin was found to inhibit the proliferation of the HCC cell lines HA22T and HA59T and induce apoptosis via the caspase pathway. Heteronemin treatment also induced the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are associated with heteronemin-induced cell death, and to trigger ROS removal by mitochondrial SOD2 rather than cytosolic SOD1. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway was associated with ROS-induced cell death, and heteronemin downregulated the expression of ERK, a MAPK that is associated with cell proliferation. Inhibitors of JNK and p38, which are MAPKs associated with apoptosis, restored heteronemin-induced cell death. In addition, heteronemin treatment reduced the expression of GPX4, a protein that inhibits ferroptosis, which is a novel form of nonapoptotic programmed cell death. Ferroptosis inhibitor treatment also restored heteronemin-induced cell death. Thus, with appropriate structural modification, heteronemin can act as a potent therapeutic against HCC.""","""['Wen-Tsan Chang', 'Yung-Ding Bow', 'Pei-Jung Fu', 'Chia-Yang Li', 'Chang-Yi Wu', 'Yi-Hua Chang', 'Yen-Ni Teng', 'Ruei-Nian Li', 'Mei-Chin Lu', 'Yi-Chang Liu', 'Chien-Chih Chiu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Oxid Med Cell Longev""","""['Koumine Promotes ROS Production to Suppress Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cell Proliferation Via NF-κB and ERK/p38 MAPK Signaling.', 'Columbamine suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma cells through down-regulation of PI3K/AKT, p38 and ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathways.', 'Breaking down Leukemia Walls: Heteronemin, a Sesterterpene Derivative, Induces Apoptosis in Leukemia Molt4 Cells through Oxidative Stress, Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Induction of Talin Expression.', 'Roles of Therapeutic Bioactive Compounds in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'The power of heteronemin in cancers.', 'A spotlight on the interplay between Wnt/β-catenin signaling and circular RNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma progression.', 'Raptor couples mTORC1 and ERK1/2 inhibition by cardamonin with oxidative stress induction in ovarian cancer cells.', 'Targeted Knockdown of Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor Enhances UVB Irradiation-Induced Apoptosis Via Increasing ROS Generation in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Salvianolic Acid B Inhibits Ferroptosis and Apoptosis during Myocardial Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury via Decreasing the Ubiquitin-Proteasome Degradation of GPX4 and the ROS-JNK/MAPK Pathways.', 'Pathogenesis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma: The Interplay of Apoptosis and Autophagy.']"""

Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and neutralizes receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) on osteoblasts and their precursors. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved dose of denosumab is 120 mg every 4 weeks; however, other schedules have been used in practice for patient convenience. Evidence for the safety and efficacy of alternative dosing intervals is lacking.  Patient & methods:   Adult patients with solid cancers and bone metastases who received at least two doses of denosumab 120 mg were reviewed. Patients were grouped based on an average denosumab dosing interval of <5 weeks (short-interval) versus 5-11 weeks (medium-interval) versus ⩾12 weeks (long-interval). The primary outcome was the time to first SRE while on denosumab between the short- and medium-interval groups. The secondary outcomes were overall survival (OS), efficacy comparisons between the other groups, and safety events.  Results:   There was no significant difference in median time to first SRE between the short- and medium-interval denosumab groups [33.2 versus 28.4 months, hazard ratio (HR): 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.66-1.92, p = 0.91] or the medium- and long-interval dosing groups (28.4 versus 32.2 months, HR: 1.15, 95% CI: 0.66-2.01, p = 0.62). Median OS was not found to differ significantly between any of the groups. There were significantly more hospitalizations in the short-interval dosing group than the other groups (55.2% versus 33.8% versus 30.4%, p < 0.001).  Conclusion:   Extending denosumab dosing intervals does not appear to negatively impact time to first SRE and is associated with fewer hospitalizations in real-world patients with solid cancers and bone metastases.""","""['Aseala I Abousaud', 'Meagan S Barbee', 'Christine C Davis', 'Sarah E Caulfield', 'Zeyuan Wang', 'Alexa Boykin', 'Bradley C Carthon', 'Keerthi Gogineni']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Ther Adv Med Oncol""","""['Experience with denosumab (XGEVA®) for prevention of skeletal-related events in the 10 years after approval.', 'Risk factors associated with skeletal-related events following discontinuation of denosumab treatment among patients with bone metastases from solid tumors: A real-world machine learning approach.', 'Bisphosphonates and other bone agents for breast cancer.', 'Economic evaluation of denosumab compared with zoledronic acid in hormone-refractory prostate cancer patients with bone metastases.', 'Bisphosphonates and other bone agents for breast cancer.', 'Progress on Denosumab Use in Giant Cell Tumor of Bone: Dose and Duration of Therapy.', 'Medication adherence with denosumab in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors treated in routine clinical settings: a retrospective study.', 'Experience with denosumab (XGEVA®) for prevention of skeletal-related events in the 10 years after approval.', 'Management of Adverse Events and Supportive Therapy in Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma.']"""

The objective of this study was to determine if transperineal prostate biopsy is associated with an increased incidence of cancer upgrading among men on active surveillance for very low or low risk prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Our active surveillance registry was queried to identify patients who underwent a surveillance biopsy following the introduction of transperineal prostate biopsy at our institution. Patients were dichotomized by the type of biopsy performed. The baseline characteristics and rates of cancer upgrading were compared between groups.  Results:   Between November 2017 and June 2020, 790 men with very low or low risk prostate cancer underwent a surveillance biopsy. In total, 59 of 279 men (21.2%) in the transperineal prostate biopsy group were upgraded to grade group ≥2 as compared to 75 of 511 (14.7%) in the transrectal biopsy group (p=0.01). Among patients who were upgraded to grade group ≥2, 26 of 59 (44%) had grade group ≥2 detected in the anterior/transition zone with transperineal prostate biopsy compared to 14 of 75 (18.7%) with transrectal biopsy (p=0.01). Additionally, 17 of 279 men (6.1%) who underwent transperineal prostate biopsy were upgraded to grade group ≥3 vs 17 of 511 (3.3%) who underwent transrectal biopsy (p=0.05). After adjusting for age, prostate specific antigen density, use of magnetic resonance imaging, and number of prior transrectal biopsies, transperineal prostate biopsy was significantly associated with upgrading to grade group ≥2 (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.11-2.19, p=0.01).  Conclusions:   Among men on active surveillance for very low or low risk prostate cancer, transperineal prostate biopsy was associated with an increased likelihood of upgrading to clinically significant prostate cancer.

Recent studies have shown that the odds of depression among men with a lifetime history of prostate cancer are higher compared to men without a lifetime history of prostate cancer. Here we extend previous findings and examine the role of socioeconomic status in the relationship between depression and cancer survivorship status in a population-based sample of men from Atlantic Canada.  Methods:   A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on a subsample of 6,585 male participants aged 49-69 years from the 2009-2015 survey cycle of the Atlantic PATH study. The primary outcome was screening positive for mild, moderate or severe depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The main predictor variable was cancer survivorship status (the presence of a lifetime history of prostate cancer, skin cancer, forms of cancer other than prostate or skin cancer, or absence of a lifetime cancer diagnosis). Covariates included age, education, marital status, household income, province, ethnicity, comorbidity, and survivorship time.  Results:   An estimated 14.7% of men in this sample screened positive for mild, moderate or severe depression. Men with a history of prostate cancer were 2.60 (95% CI: 1.02, 6.65) times more likely to screen positive for depression than men with a history of any other form of cancer. The odds ratios were 10.23 (95% CI: 2.82, 37.49) or 4.00 (95% CI: 1.20, 13.34) times higher for survivors of prostate or skin cancer who reported a low household income to screen positive for depression compared to men with a history of any other form of cancer and high household income.  Conclusions:   These results extend current evidence of the association between prostate cancer survivorship and depression compared with men who never had a history of cancer diagnosis by indicating that this association still stands when the survivors of prostate cancer are compared to survivors of any other form of cancer, and further indicates that this association is moderated by household income.

Herein, molecular mechanisms leading to up-regulation of CD24 in prostate cancer were studied. DNA methylation of the CD24 gene promoter at four loci using quantitative methylation-specific PCR was evaluated. Expression of CD24 in tumor tissues was studied by immunohistochemistry. To corroborate the results in vitro, ERG-inducible LNCaP TMPRSS2:ERG (T2E) cells and luciferase promoter assays were used. DNA methylation of the CD24 promoter was significantly higher in tumors than in benign tissue and was associated with biochemical recurrence-free survival, tumor grade, and stage. CD24 mRNA and protein expression were significantly higher in T2E-positive, ERG-overexpressing, and/or PTEN-deficient cases. Higher levels of CD24 protein expression conferred shorter biochemical recurrence-free survival, and these observations were confirmed using The Cancer Genome Atlas prostate adenocarcinoma data. In silico analysis of the CD24 promoter revealed an ERG binding site in between the DNA methylation sites. ERG overexpression led to a strong induction of CD24 mRNA and protein expression. Luciferase promoter assays using the wild-type and mutated ERG binding site within the CD24 promoter showed ERG-dependent activation. Collectively, our results suggest that promoter DNA methylation of the CD24 gene and T2E fusion status are factors involved in the up-regulation of CD24 in patients with prostate cancer.""","""['Yuri Tolkach', 'Romina Zarbl', 'Simone Bauer', 'Manuel Ritter', 'Jörg Ellinger', 'Stephan Hauser', 'Laura Hüser', 'Sabine M Klauck', 'Peter Altevogt', 'Holger Sültmann', 'Dimo Dietrich', 'Glen Kristiansen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Am J Pathol""","""['EZH2-induced lysine K362 methylation enhances TMPRSS2-ERG oncogenic activity in prostate cancer.', 'βIII-tubulin overexpression is an independent predictor of prostate cancer progression tightly linked to ERG fusion status and PTEN deletion.', 'Micro-RNA-204 Participates in TMPRSS2/ERG Regulation and Androgen Receptor Reprogramming in Prostate Cancer.', 'ERG protein expression as a biomarker of prostate cancer.', 'The prognostic role of ERG immunopositivity in prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma: a study including 454 cases and review of the literature.', 'CD24-associated ceRNA network reveals prognostic biomarkers in breast carcinoma.', 'A Mini-Review of Flavone Isomers Apigenin and Genistein in Prostate Cancer Treatment.']"""

Methods and materials:   In total, 110 patients with high-risk prostate cancer received 110 Gy LDR-BT, followed by 45 Gy VMAT. Rectal toxicity was recorded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v.4.03. The dosimetric factors associated with LDR-BT and VMAT were analyzed to determine their relationship with rectal toxicity. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed for ≥ grade 2 (G2) rectal toxicity prediction.  Results:   The follow-up duration was 10.1-115.2 months (median 60.5 months). Seven patients had G2 rectal hemorrhage, and none of the patients had grade 3 rectal hemorrhage. In the univariate analysis, the rectal volume receiving 100% of the prescribed dose (rV100) (p < 0.001), the dose covering 2 cc of the rectum (rD2cc) during LDR-BT (p = 0.002), and the combined rD2cc during LDR-BT and VMAT (p = 0.001) were identified as predictors of G2 rectal hemorrhage. In the ROC curve analysis, the cutoff value was 0.46 cc for rV100, 74.0 Gy for rD2cc, and 86.8 GyEQD2 for combined rD2cc.  Conclusion:   Predictors of late ≥ G2 rectal hemorrhage are rV100, rD2cc, and combined rD2cc.

Methods:   Patients who underwent both Gallium-68 PSMA PET/CT and MRI of the prostate over the course of a year were selected for analysis. The CT images with visible calcifications within the prostate were included and calcifications automatically isolated using a threshold of 130 HU. The corresponding multiparametric MRI was assessed and the peripheral zone, transition zone, MRI-visible tumor, and urethra manually contoured. The contoured MRI and CT images were registered using rigid registration, and calcifications mapped automatically to the MRI contours.  Results:   A total of 85 men (age range 50-88, mean 69 years, standard deviation 7.2 years) were assessed. The mean serum Prostate Specific Antigen PSA was 16.7, range 0.12 to 94.4. Most patients had intermediate-risk disease (68%; Gleason grade group 2 and 3), 26% had high-risk disease (Gleason grade group 4 and 5), and 6% had low-risk disease (Gleason grade group 1). Forty-six patients out of 85 (54%) had intraprostatic calcification. Calcification occurred more in transition zone than the peripheral zone (65% vs. 35%). The mean density of the calcification was 227 HU (min 133, max 1,966 HU). In 12 patients, the calcification was within an MRI-visible tumor, in 24 patients, there were calcifications within a 9 mm distance of the tumor border, and in 9 patients, there were calcifications located between the urethra and tumor.  Conclusions:   Calcifications are common in patients with prostate cancer.

A population-based benchmark for use of surgery in high-income settings to inform policy makers and service provision has not been developed but was recommended by the Lancet Oncology Commission on Global Cancer Surgery. We aimed to develop and validate a cancer surgery benchmarking model.  Methods:   We examined the latest clinical guidelines from high-income countries (Australia, the UK, the EU, the USA, and Canada) and mapped surgical treatment pathways for 30 malignant cancer sites (19 individual sites and 11 grouped as other cancers) that were notifiable in Australia in 2014, broadly reflecting contemporary high-income models of care. The optimal use of surgery was considered as an indication for surgery where surgery is the treatment of choice for a given clinical scenario. Population-based epidemiological data, such as cancer stage, tumour characteristics, and fitness for surgery, were derived from Australia and other similar high-income settings for 2017. The probabilities across the clinical pathways of each cancer were multiplied and added together to estimate the population-level benchmark rates of cancer surgery, and further validated with the comparisons of observed rates of cancer surgery in the South Western Sydney Local Health District in 2006-12. Univariable and multivariable sensitivity analyses were done to explore uncertainty around model inputs, with mean (95% CI) benchmark surgery rates estimated on the basis of 10 000 Monte Carlo simulations.  Findings:   Surgical treatment was indicated in 58% (95% CI 57-59) of newly diagnosed patients with cancer in Australia in 2014 at least once during the course of their treatment, but varied by site from 23% (17-27) for prostate cancer to 99% (96-99) for testicular cancer. Observed cancer surgery rates in South Western Sydney were comparable to the benchmarks for most cancers, but were higher for some cancers, such as prostate (absolute increase of 29%) and lower for others, such as lung (-14%).  Interpretation:   The model provides a new template for high-income and emerging economies to rationally plan and assess their cancer surgery provision. There are differences in modelled versus observed surgery rates for some cancers, requiring more in-depth analysis of the observed differences.

Methods:   This retrospective study included 59 patients with recently recorded biochemical recurrence of PCa (mean PSA 1.96 ± 1.64 ng/mL) after radical prostatectomy. Patients received PET/CT with either 68Ga-PSMA-11 (n = 36) or 18F-PSMA-1007 (n = 23). PET/CT and CT images were evaluated separately in regard to PCa lesion count, type, and localisation by two physicians. Histopathology, follow-up imaging and PSA levels after salvage irradiation served as reference standard. A McNemar test was used to compare detection rates. Changes in therapeutic approaches based on staging differences between CT alone and PET/CT were assessed in a virtual multidisciplinary tumour board.  Results:   There were 142 lesions in 50 of 59 patients. PSMA PET/CT detected 141 lesions (99.3 %) in 50 patients (84.7 %), while CT detected 72 lesions (50.7 %) in 29 patients (49.2 %). A significantly higher detection rate of PSMA PET/CT was observed on a lesion-based analysis (p < 0.0001) and on a patient based analysis (p < 0.0001). Herein, both 68Ga- and 18F-PSMA PET/CT performed significantly better than CT alone (p < 0.0001, respectively). In 9 patients (15.3 %) no relapse was detectable by either modality. All lesions detected by CT were also detected by PSMA PET/CT. In 38 patients PSMA PET/CT detected more lesions than CT alone, altering the treatment approach in 22 of these patients.

The Gleason scoring system is the primary diagnostic tool for prostate cancer. This is obtained via the visual analysis of cancerous patterns in prostate biopsies performed by expert pathologists, and the aggregation of the main Gleason grades in a combined score. Computer-aided diagnosis systems allow to reduce the workload of pathologists and increase the objectivity. Nevertheless, those require a large number of labeled samples, with pixel-level annotations performed by expert pathologists, to be developed. Recently, efforts have been made in the literature to develop algorithms aiming the direct estimation of the global Gleason score at biopsy/core level with global labels. However, these algorithms do not cover the accurate localization of the Gleason patterns into the tissue. These location maps are the basis to provide a reliable computer-aided diagnosis system to the experts to be used in clinical practice by pathologists. In this work, we propose a deep-learning-based system able to detect local cancerous patterns in the prostate tissue using only the global-level Gleason score obtained from clinical records during training.  Methods:   The methodological core of this work is the proposed weakly-supervised-trained convolutional neural network, WeGleNet, based on a multi-class segmentation layer after the feature extraction module, a global-aggregation, and the slicing of the background class for the model loss estimation during training.  Results:   Using a public dataset of prostate tissue-micro arrays, we obtained a Cohen's quadratic kappa (κ) of 0.67 for the pixel-level prediction of cancerous patterns in the validation cohort. We compared the model performance for semantic segmentation of Gleason grades with supervised state-of-the-art architectures in the test cohort. We obtained a pixel-level κ of 0.61 and a macro-averaged f1-score of 0.58, at the same level as fully-supervised methods. Regarding the estimation of the core-level Gleason score, we obtained a κ of 0.76 and 0.67 between the model and two different pathologists.  Conclusions:   WeGleNet is capable of performing the semantic segmentation of Gleason grades similarly to fully-supervised methods without requiring pixel-level annotations. Moreover, the model reached a performance at the same level as inter-pathologist agreement for the global Gleason scoring of the cores.""","""['Julio Silva-Rodríguez', 'Adrián Colomer', 'Valery Naranjo']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Comput Med Imaging Graph""","""['Going deeper through the Gleason scoring scale: An automatic end-to-end system for histology prostate grading and cribriform pattern detection.', 'Self-Learning for Weakly Supervised Gleason Grading of Local Patterns.', 'Semi-supervised training of deep convolutional neural networks with heterogeneous data and few local annotations: An experiment on prostate histopathology image classification.', 'Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.', 'Inference of core needle biopsy whole slide images requiring definitive therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Identification and Classification of Prostate Cancer Identification and Classification Based on Improved Convolution Neural Network.', 'Artificial Intelligence-Based Segmentation of Residual Tumor in Histopathology of Pancreatic Cancer after Neoadjuvant Treatment.']"""

This has imposed the challenge of finding gene markers for early cancer detection and treatment strategies. Different methods including regression-based Cox-PH, artificial neural networks, and recently deep learning algorithms have been proposed to predict the survival rate for cancers. We established in this work a novel graph convolution neural network (GCNN) approach called Surv_GCNN to predict the survival rate for 13 different cancer types using the TCGA dataset. For each cancer type, 6 Surv_GCNN models with graphs generated by correlation analysis, GeneMania database, and correlation + GeneMania were trained with and without clinical data to predict the risk score (RS). The performance of the 6 Surv_GCNN models was compared with two other existing models, Cox-PH and Cox-nnet. The results showed that Cox-PH has the worst performance among 8 tested models across the 13 cancer types while Surv_GCNN models with clinical data reported the best overall performance, outperforming other competing models in 7 out of 13 cancer types including BLCA, BRCA, COAD, LUSC, SARC, STAD, and UCEC. A novel network-based interpretation of Surv_GCNN was also proposed to identify potential gene markers for breast cancer. The signatures learned by the nodes in the hidden layer of Surv_GCNN were identified and were linked to potential gene markers by network modularization. The identified gene markers for breast cancer have been compared to a total of 213 gene markers from three widely cited lists for breast cancer survival analysis. About 57% of gene markers obtained by Surv_GCNN with correlation + GeneMania graph either overlap or directly interact with the 213 genes, confirming the effectiveness of the identified markers by Surv_GCNN.""","""['Ricardo Ramirez', 'Yu-Chiao Chiu', 'SongYao Zhang', 'Joshua Ramirez', 'Yidong Chen', 'Yufei Huang', 'Yu-Fang Jin']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Methods""","""['Classification of Cancer Types Using Graph Convolutional Neural Networks.', 'Learning graph in graph convolutional neural networks for robust seizure prediction.', 'Machine Learning with Enormous ""Synthetic"" Data Sets: Predicting Glass Transition Temperature of Polyimides Using Graph Convolutional Neural Networks.', 'Machine Learning of Reaction Properties via Learned Representations of the Condensed Graph of Reaction.', 'Exploring different computational approaches for effective diagnosis of breast cancer.', 'Deep Learning Techniques with Genomic Data in Cancer Prognosis: A Comprehensive Review of the 2021-2023 Literature.', 'AttOmics: attention-based architecture for diagnosis and prognosis from omics data.', 'Platelet-Based Liquid Biopsies through the Lens of Machine Learning.', 'Machine Learning Methods for Cancer Classification Using Gene Expression Data: A Review.', 'Characterizing Macrophages Diversity in COVID-19 Patients Using Deep Learning.']"""

Methods:   This study was a single-site, two-arm randomised controlled trial, with 40 participants randomised to either the intervention or control group over a 10-month period. In addition to receiving usual care, the intervention group completed three weekly RET sessions using resistance bands for 6 months. Participants performed 3 sets of 12-15 repetitions for each exercise, targeting each major muscle group. The control group received usual care only. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) was the primary outcome and assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Secondary outcomes included body weight, body fat, aerobic fitness, strength and blood-borne biomarkers associated with cardiometabolic risk.  Results:   There was no significant difference between the groups in FMD at 3 or 6 months. However, there were improvements in aerobic exercise capacity (P < 0.01) and upper- (P < 0.01) and lower-limb (P = 0.01) strength in favour of the RET group at 6 months, accompanied by greater weight loss (P = 0.04) and a reduction in body fat (P = 0.02). Improvements in HRQoL were evident in the RET group at 3 and 6 months via the PCa-specific component of the FACT-P questionnaire (both P < 0.01). Five adverse events and one serious adverse event were reported throughout the trial duration.  Conclusion:   This study demonstrates that home-based RET is an effective and safe mode of exercise that elicits beneficial effects on aerobic exercise capacity, muscular strength and HR-QoL in men who have undergone RARP.

This retrospective multicenter study evaluated the potential of T2W image-derived textural features for quantitative assessment of peripheral zone prostate cancer (PCa) aggressiveness. A standardized preoperative multiparametric MRI was performed on 87 PCa patients across 6 institutions. T2W intensity and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) histogram, and T2W textural features were computed from tumor volumes annotated based on whole-mount histology.

It has been recently demonstrated that cancer cells are vulnerable to ferroptosis inducers (FIN). However, the therapeutic potential of FINs in prostate cancer in preclinical settings has not been explored. In this study, we demonstrate that mediators of ferroptosis, solute carrier family 7 member 11, SLC3A2, and glutathione peroxidase, are expressed in treatment-resistant prostate cancer. We further demonstrate that treatment-resistant prostate cancer cells are sensitive to two FINs, erastin and RSL3. Treatment with erastin and RSL3 led to a significant decrease in prostate cancer cell growth and migration in vitro and significantly delayed the tumor growth of treatment-resistant prostate cancer in vivo, with no measurable side effects. Combination of erastin or RSL3 with standard-of-care second-generation antiandrogens for advanced prostate cancer halted prostate cancer cell growth and migration in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. These results demonstrate the potential of erastin or RSL3 independently and in combination with standard-of-care second-generation antiandrogens as novel therapeutic strategies for advanced prostate cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings reveal that induction of ferroptosis is a new therapeutic strategy for advanced prostate cancer as a monotherapy and in combination with second-generation antiandrogens.""","""['Ali Ghoochani', 'En-Chi Hsu', 'Merve Aslan', 'Meghan A Rice', 'Holly M Nguyen', 'James D Brooks', 'Eva Corey', 'Ramasamy Paulmurugan', 'Tanya Stoyanova']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Everolimus accelerates Erastin and RSL3-induced ferroptosis in renal cell carcinoma.', 'Ferroptosis inducer erastin downregulates androgen receptor and its splice variants in castration‑resistant prostate cancer.', 'Mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 regulates ferroptosis in drug-tolerant persister head and neck cancer cells via epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'Lipid Peroxidation-Dependent Cell Death Regulated by GPx4 and Ferroptosis.', 'Targeting persistent androgen receptor signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Protein phosphatase 2A-B55β mediated mitochondrial p-GPX4 dephosphorylation promoted sorafenib-induced ferroptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma via regulating p53 retrograde signaling.', 'circACTA2 inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated inflammation via interacting with NF-κB in vascular smooth muscle cells.', 'Ferroptosis as a potential target for cancer therapy.', 'HSF1 is a novel prognostic biomarker in high-risk prostate cancer that correlates with ferroptosis.', 'Non-canonical role of UCKL1 on ferroptosis defence in colorectal cancer.']"""

High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is one of the most studied sources for tissue ablation and has been used since the 1990s.  Objective:   To provide 21-yr oncological long-term follow-up data of an unselected series of patients who underwent whole-gland HIFU for nonmetastatic prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 674 patients were treated between November 1997 and November 2012 in one university center.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The oncological outcome was assessed by biopsy failure-free survival (BFFS), salvage treatment-free survival (STFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS). Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were performed to estimate the prognostic relevance of clinical variables.  Results and limitations:   In total, 560 patients were included into the evaluation and the median follow-up was 15.1 yr, with a range up to 21.4 yr. At 15 yr, CSS rates for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients were 95%, 89%, and 65%, respectively; MFS, STFS-1 (salvage treatment other than HIFU), STFS-2 (salvage treatment including repeat HIFU), and BFFS rates were 91%, 85%, and 58%; 77%, 63%, and 29%; 67%, 52%, and 28%; and 82%, 73%, and 47%, respectively. Preoperative high-risk category was an independent predictor of inferior OS, CSS, MFS, STFS, and BFFS.  Conclusions:   Although whole-gland HIFU achieved good long-term cancer control in low- and intermediate-risk patients, high-risk patients should not be treated routinely by HIFU. Intermediate-risk patients achieve high CSS and MFS rates, but a relevant salvage treatment rate has to be reckoned with. Long-term data after whole-gland therapy might help derive implications for focal treatment sources and patient selection.  Patient summary:   Long-term data after whole-gland high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy are crucial to prove its oncological efficacy, and may help derive implications for focal treatment strategies and patient selection. In this context, whole-gland HIFU achieved good long-term cancer control up to 21 yr in low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa) patients. Owing to considerably inferior long-term cancer control, it should not routinely be used in high-risk PCa patients.""","""['Johannes Bründl', 'Vera Osberghaus', 'Florian Zeman', 'Johannes Breyer', 'Roman Ganzer', 'Andreas Blana', 'Michael Gierth', 'Stefan Denzinger', 'Maximilian Burger', 'Bernd Rosenhammer']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Urological Oncology: Prostate Cancer.', 'Medium-term Outcomes after Whole-gland High-intensity Focused Ultrasound for the Treatment of Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer from a Multicentre Registry Cohort.', 'Oncological long-term outcome of whole gland HIFU and open radical prostatectomy: a comparative analysis.', 'Medium-term Oncological Efficacy and Patient-reported Outcomes After Focal High-intensity Focused Ultrasound: The FOXPRO Trial.', 'Systematic review of the efficacy and safety of high-intensity focussed ultrasound for the primary and salvage treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Treatment of localized prostate cancer with high-intensity focused ultrasound.', 'Evolving imaging methods of prostate cancer and the emergence of magnetic resonance imaging guided ablation techniques.', 'Whole-gland high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation and transurethral resection of the prostate in the patients with prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Comparing the toxicity and disease control rate of radiotherapy for prostate cancer between salvage settings after high-intensity focused ultrasound therapy and initial settings.', 'Long-term outcomes of whole gland high-intensity focused ultrasound for localized prostate cancer.', 'Applications of Focused Ultrasound in the Treatment of Genitourinary Cancers.']"""

Evidence for serial MRI in men on active surveillance (AS) is lacking.  Objective:   To evaluate the role of MRI in detecting Gleason grade group (GG) ≥2 disease in confirmatory and subsequent surveillance biopsies for men on AS.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a single-center study of men with low-risk prostate cancer enrolled in an AS cohort between 2006 and 2018. All men were diagnosed by systematic biopsy and underwent MRI prior to confirmatory (""MRI1"") and subsequent surveillance (""MRI2"") biopsies. MRI lesions were scored with Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary outcome was biopsy upgrade to GG ≥ 2 prostate cancer, and the secondary outcome was definitive treatment. Test characteristics for PI-RADS score were calculated. Multivariable logistic and Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to determine the associations between PI-RADS score change and outcomes, on a per-examination basis.  Results and limitations:   Of 125 men with a median follow-up of 78 mo, 38% experienced an increase in PI-RADS scores. The sensitivity and positive predictive value of PI-RADS ≥3 for GG ≥ 2 disease improved from MRI1 to MRI2 (from 85% to 91% and from 26% to 49%, respectively). An increase in PI-RADS scores from MRI1 to MRI2 was associated with GG ≥ 2 (odds ratio [OR] 4.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7-13.2) compared with PI-RADS 1-3 on both MRI scans. Men with PI-RADS 4-5 lesions on both MRI scans had a higher likelihood of GG ≥ 2 than patients with PI-RADS 1-3 lesions on both (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.3-8.6). Importantly, any increase in PI-RADS scores was independently associated with definitive treatment (hazard ratio 3.9, 95% CI 1.3-11.9). This study was limited by its retrospective, single-center design.  Conclusions:   The prognostic value of MRI improves with serial examination and provides additional risk stratification. Validation in other cohorts is needed.

A subset of these SNPs may be additively combined to generate genetic risk scores (GRSs) that confer risk for a specific disease. Although the clinical validity of GRSs to predict risk of specific diseases has been well established, there is still a great need to determine their clinical utility by applying GRSs in primary care for cancer risk assessment and targeted intervention.  Methods:   This clinical study involved 281 primary care patients without a personal history of breast, prostate or colorectal cancer who were 40-70 years old. DNA was obtained from a pre-existing biobank at NorthShore University HealthSystem. GRSs for colorectal cancer and breast or prostate cancer were calculated and shared with participants through their primary care provider. Additional data was gathered using questionnaires as well as electronic medical record information. A t-test or Chi-square test was applied for comparison of demographic and key clinical variables among different groups.  Results:   The median age of the 281 participants was 58 years and the majority were female (66.6%). One hundred one (36.9%) participants received 2 low risk scores, 99 (35.2%) received 1 low risk and 1 average risk score, 37 (13.2%) received 1 low risk and 1 high risk score, 23 (8.2%) received 2 average risk scores, 21 (7.5%) received 1 average risk and 1 high risk score, and no one received 2 high risk scores. Before receiving GRSs, younger patients and women reported significantly more worry about risk of developing cancer. After receiving GRSs, those who received at least one high GRS reported significantly more worry about developing cancer. There were no significant differences found between gender, age, or GRS with regards to participants' reported optimism about their future health neither before nor after receiving GRS results.

To calculate dose-volume indices, a reconstruction algorithm is used to determine the 3D organ shape from 2D contours, inevitably containing settings that influence the result. We augment the optimization approach to quickly find plans that are robust to differences in 3D reconstruction.  Methods:   Studied reconstruction settings were: interpolation between delineated organ contours, overlap between contours, and organ shape at the top and bottom contour. Two options for each setting yields 8 possible 3D organ reconstructions per patient, over which the robust model defines minimax optimization. For the original model, settings were based on our treatment planning system. Both models were tested on data of 26 patients and compared by re-evaluating selected optimized plans both in the original model (1 organ reconstruction, the difference determines the cost), and in the robust model (8 organ reconstructions, the difference determines the benefit).  Results:   Robust optimization increased the run time from 3 to 6 min. The median cost for robust optimization as observed in the original model was -0.25% in the dose-volume indices with a range of [-0.01%, -1.03%]. The median benefit of robust optimization as observed in the robust model was 0.93% with a range of [0.19%, 4.16%]. For 4 patients, selected plans that appeared good when optimized in the original model, violated the clinical protocol with more than 1% when considering different settings. This was not the case for robustly optimized plans.  Conclusions:   Plans of high quality, irrespective of 3D organ reconstruction settings, can be obtained using our robust optimization approach.

Methods:   We treated human primary prostate stromal cells (PrSC) with 1uM recombinant SEMA3C protein and androgen precursor named dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) 1.7uM. Also, to test SEMA3C's effect on the conversion of DHEA to androgens, we exposed PrSCs to the conditioned media derived from LNCaP cells that were transduced with a lentiviral vector harboring full length SEMA3C gene or empty vector (CM-LNSEMA3C or CM-LNVector ). Then, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed on steroids isolated from PrSCs media. The messnger RNA expression of steroidogenic enzymes in PrSCs was quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.  Results:   Recombinant SEMA3C had no effect on steroidogenic activities in PrSCs. However, key steroidogenic enzymes expression and androgen synthesis were upregulated in PrSCs treated with CM-LNSEMA3C , compared to those treated with CM-LNVector . These results suggest that steroidogenic activities in PrSCs were upregulated in response to a signaling factor in CM-LNSEMA3C , other than SEMA3C. We hypothesized that SEMA3C overexpression in LNCaP cells affected androgen synthesis in PrSCs through sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway activation in PrSCs. We verified this effect by blocking Shh signaling with smoothened antagonist.  Conclusion:   Based on known ability of Shh signaling pathway to activate steroidogenesis in stromal cells, we suggest that SEMA3C overexpression in LNCaP cells can upregulate Shh which in turn is able to stimulate steroidogenic activities in prostatic stromal cells.""","""['Parvin Yenki', 'Hans H Adomat', 'Christopher J Ong']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Paracrine sonic hedgehog signaling contributes significantly to acquired steroidogenesis in the prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'Paracrine Hedgehog increases the steroidogenic potential of prostate stromal cells in a Gli-dependent manner.', 'Prostate cancer stromal cells and LNCaP cells coordinately activate the androgen receptor through synthesis of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone from dehydroepiandrosterone.', 'Intratumoral steroidogenesis in castration-resistant prostate cancer: a target for therapy.', 'Semaphorin 3C as a Therapeutic Target in Prostate and Other Cancers.']"""

Methods:   In this retrospective study of data collected between 2016 and 2019, we assessed change in cardiorespiratory fitness, whole-body muscular endurance, physical function and strength, anthropometrics, fatigue, and quality of life (QoL), after participation in POWER. Descriptive statistics were calculated for demographic and clinical variables. Univariate analysis of variance was carried out with age and BMI at initial assessment as covariates.  Results:   A total of 239 survivors, 78% rural residents, completed a follow-up assessment. Among rural cancer survivors, the most prevalent cancer sites were breast (42.5%), prostate (12.4%), and lymphoma (5.9%). The majority of survivors were female (70%), non-Hispanic (94.6%), and white (93.5%), with average age and BMI of 62.1 ± 13.2 years and 28.4 ± 6.7 kg/m2, respectively. Rural cancer survivors with cancer stages I-III exhibited significant improvements in fitness (+ 3.07 ml/kg/min, 95% CI 1.93, 4.21; + 0.88 METS, 95% CI 0.55, 1.20), physical function (30-s chair stand: + 2.2 repetitions, 95% CI 1.3, 3.1), muscular endurance (10-repetition maximum: chest press + 4.1 kg, 95% CI 2.0, 6.3; lateral pulldown + 6.6 kg, 95% CI 4.4, 8.9), self-reported fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue score: + 4.9, 95% CI 1.6, 8.1), and QoL (FACT-G7 score + 2.1, 95% CI, 0.9, 3.4).

Methods:   Patients (n = 85) treated with external beam radiotherapy between 1997 and 2013 following radical prostatectomy (RPE) with pathological tumour stage pT2c with positive surgical margins or pT3 and pT4 tumours with or without positive margins who presented with a postoperative and a preradiation prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level below 0.1 ng/ml. The mean dose applied was 66 Gy with conventional fractionation (4 field box-technique). No androgen deprivation therapy was administered, and patients with incomplete data (missing Gleason score, pT stage, or PSA values postoperatively and/or prior to radiation at the presentation at our department) have been excluded from the analysis. Biochemical recurrence was defined as reaching a PSA level > 0.2 ng/ml during follow-up and bNED rates were assessed. In addition, patients were divided into two groups according to the Roach formula for predicting the risk of pelvic node involvement at a cut-off value of 15%. Late urogenital and gastrointestinal side effects (EORTC/RTOG) were assessed.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 60 months the bNED rate was 88% at 5 years and 72% at 10 years for all patients. Patients with low risk of lymph node involvement (group < 15%) had a 5 year and 10 year bNED of 97% and 85%, while patients with high risk of positive lymph node involvement (group > 15%) showed corresponding bNED rates of 77% and 52%, respectively. A significant difference according to the Roach stratification was detected (p ≤ 0.002). Late urogenital (UG) and gastrointestinal (GI) grade ≥ 2 side effects were detected in 10% and 15%, respectively.

Here, we describe the long-lasting sensitivity to various forms of androgen deprivation in patients after radical prostatectomy (RP) for locally advanced PCa as one potential mechanism.  Methods:   A consecutive series of 115 radical prostatectomies after inductive therapy for T4 prostate cancer was re-analyzed, and long-term survival, as well as recurrence patterns and responses to different forms of hormonal manipulation, were assessed.  Results:   The estimated biochemical response-free, PCa-specific, and overall survival rates after 200 months were 20%, 65%, and 47% with a median overall survival of 156 months. The majority of patients, although not cured of locally advanced PCa (84/115), showed long-term survival after RP. PCa-specific and overall survival rates of these 84 patients with biochemical recurrence were 61% and 44% at 150 months. Long-term sensitivity to ADT was found to be the main reason for the favorable tumor-specific survival in spite of biochemical recurrence.  Conclusions:   Sensitivity to primary or secondary hormonal manipulation was the main reason for the long-term survival of patients who had not been cured by surgery only. The results suggest that treatment of the primary tumor-bearing prostate delays castration-resistant PCa and enhances the effect of hormonal therapies in a previously unknown manner. The underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms need to be explored in more detailed analyses, which could profoundly impact treatment concepts of locally advanced and metastatic PCa.""","""['Christina Niklas#', 'Matthias Saar#', 'Alessandro Nini', 'Johannes Linxweiler', 'Stefan Siemer', 'Kerstin Junker', 'Michael Stoeckle']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Subjects/patients and methods:   1581 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy (RT) for primary treatment of PCa between July 2007 and January 2020 were evaluated for statin use, demographic/oncologic characteristics, and biochemical outcomes. Rate of biochemical failure (BF) was assessed overall and at 1, 3, and 5 years; time to BF was estimated with Kaplan-Meier. Logistic and linear regression were used to control for treatment modality and disease characteristics.  Results:   The average age was 63.0 ± 7.5 years and median pre-treatment PSA was 6.55 (IQR 4.94). 1473 (93.2%) and 108 (6.8%) underwent RP and RT, respectively. RP patients were younger, had lower pre-PSA, lower BMI, and lower risk disease. At 3.4 ± 2.7 years follow-up, 323 (20.4%) experienced BF. When stratified by statin use, BF overall and within 1, 3, and 5 years were not different. Time to BF, was lower in patients using statins (1.8 ± 1.9 years vs. 2.4 ± 2.6 years; p = 0.016). These results persisted in multivariate analysis, wherein statin use was not associated with BF but was associated with a shorter time to BF.  Conclusion:   Overall, statin use was not associated with a reduced risk of BF in RP or RT patients. However, for patients with BF, statin use was associated with a decreased time to BF.

Studies have shown that various Foeniculum vulgare (fennel) extracts exhibit anti-cancer effects on malignant tumors such as skin cancer and prostate cancer. However, the anti-tumor activity of Foeniculum vulgare and its underlying molecular mechanisms towards HCC are unknown. Here, we provide fundamental evidence to show that the 75% ethanol extract of Foeniculum vulgare seeds (FVE) reduced cell viability, induced apoptosis, and effectively inhibited cell migration in HCC cells in vitro. HCC xenograft studies in nude mice showed that FVE significantly inhibited HCC growth in vivo. Mechanistic analyses showed that FVE reduced survivin protein levels and triggered mitochondrial toxicity, subsequently inducing caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. Survivin inhibition effectively sensitized HCC cells to FVE-induced apoptosis. Moreover, FVE did not induce a decrease in survivin or apoptotic toxicity in normal liver cells. Collectively, in vivo and in vitro results suggest that FVE exerts inhibitory effects in HCC by targeting the oncoprotein survivin, suggesting FVE may be a potential anti-cancer agent that may benefit patients with HCC.""","""['Weiwei Ke', 'Hongbo Wang', 'Xiangxuan Zhao', 'Zaiming Lu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Food Funct""","""['Foeniculum vulgare seed extract induces apoptosis in lung cancer cells partly through the down-regulation of Bcl-2.', 'Resina Draconis extract exerts anti-HCC effects through METTL3-m6A-Survivin axis.', 'Livistona chinensis seed suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma growth through promotion of mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis.', 'Pogostemon cablin Triggered ROS-Induced DNA Damage to Arrest Cell Cycle Progression and Induce Apoptosis on Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma In Vitro and In Vivo.', 'Survivin in survival of hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Evaluation of the Anti-Metastatic Effect of Foeniculum Vulgare on the Protein Expression of HSP 70 & 90 in Balb/c Mice with 4t1 Model of Breast Cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   All patients included were enrolled in trials evaluating intense androgen deprivation therapy followed by radical prostatectomy. The primary end point was time to biochemical recurrence, defined as the time from radical prostatectomy to prostate specific antigen >0.1 ng/ml or start of first post-radical prostatectomy therapy, stratified by pathological response at radical prostatectomy (presence or absence of exceptional pathological response defined as residual tumor at radical prostatectomy measuring 0-5 mm).

However, the nuclear functions of miR-145 are yet limited. Here, we aimed at investigating the inductive role of miR-145 on the expression of Semaphorin 3A (SEMA3A) in PCa cell lines. To study the regulatory potential of miR-145 in the transcriptional level in PCa, we overexpressed miR-145 in PC3 and DU145 cells, and confirmed its upregulation by quantitative-real-time-PCR. Then we investigated the tumor suppressor potential of miR-145 upon inducing SEMA3A expression using cell viability assay, western blot analysis, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation assay and luciferase reporter assay. Our results revealed that p53, miR-145, and SEMA3A expressions are significantly downregulated in PC3 and DU145 cells compared to nontumorigenic prostate epithelial PNT1a cells. miR-145 overexpression in PCa cells induced the expression of SEMA3A at both messenger RNA and protein levels. Furthermore, increased miR-145 expression enriched RNA Pol-II antibody on the promoter of SEMA3A and induced luciferase activity controlled by SEMA3A promoter.

However, some patients display a primary resistance, and several studies investigated the role of the AR as a predictive biomarker of response to treatment. This study is aimed to evaluate the role of AR in liquid biopsy to predict clinical outcome to AR signaling inhibitors in mCRPC patients.  Methods:   Six milliliters of plasma samples were collected before first-line treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide. Circulating free DNA (cfDNA) and exosome-RNA were isolated for analysis of AR gain and AR splice variant 7 (AR-V7), respectively, by digital droplet PCR.  Results:   Eighty-four mCRPC patients received abiraterone (n = 40) or enzalutamide (n = 44) as first-line therapy. Twelve patients (14.3%) presented AR gain and 30 (35.7%) AR-V7+ at baseline.

Patients carrying the AR gain had a median PFS of 4.8 vs 24.3 months for AR normal patients (p < 0.0001). Median OS was significantly longer in AR normal vs patients with AR gain (not reached vs 8.17 months, p < 0.0001). A significant correlation between AR-V7 and AR gain was observed (r = 0.28; p = 0.01). The AR gain/AR-V7 combined analysis confirmed a strong predictive effect for biomarkers combination vs patients without any AR aberration (PFS 3.8 vs 28 month, respectively; OS 6.1 vs not reached, respectively; p < 0.0001).

Here, we investigated the release of miR-424 in circulating small EVs or exosomes from prostate cancer patients and assessed the functional implications in multiple experimental models. We found higher frequency of circulating miR-424 positive EVs in patients with metastatic prostate cancer compared to patients with primary tumors and BPH. Release of miR-424 in small EVs was enhanced in cell lines (LNCaPabl), transgenic mice (Pb-Cre4;Ptenflox/flox;Rosa26ERG/ERG) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of aggressive disease. EVs containing miR-424 promoted stem-like traits and tumor-initiating properties in normal prostate epithelial cells while enhanced tumorigenesis in transformed prostate epithelial cells. Intravenous administration of miR-424 positive EVs to mice, mimicking blood circulation, promoted miR-424 transfer and tumor growth in xenograft models.

Detecting cancer and identifying its metastatic potential at the early stage is important. This may be achieved based on the quantification of the key biomolecular components within tissues and cells using recent optical spectroscopic techniques. The aim of this study was to develop a noninvasive label-free optical biopsy technique to retrieve the characteristic molecular information for detecting different metastatic potentials of prostate cancer cells. Herein we report using native fluorescence (NFL) spectroscopy along with machine learning (ML) to differentiate prostate cancer cells with different metastatic abilities. The ML algorithms including principal component analysis (PCA) and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) were used for dimension reduction and feature detection. The characteristic component spectra were used to identify the key biomolecules that are correlated with metastatic potentials. The relative concentrations of the molecular spectral components were retrieved and used to classify the cancer cells with different metastatic potentials. A multi-class classification was performed using support vector machines (SVMs). The NFL spectral data were collected from three prostate cancer cell lines with different levels of metastatic potentials. The key biomolecules in the prostate cancer cells were identified to be tryptophan, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and hypothetically lactate as well. The cancer cells with different metastatic potentials were classified with high accuracy using the relative concentrations of the key molecular components. The results suggest that the changes in the relative concentrations of these key fluorophores retrieved from NFL spectra may present potential criteria for detecting prostate cancer cells of different metastatic abilities.""","""['Jianpeng Xue', 'Yang Pu', 'Jason Smith', 'Xin Gao', 'Chun Wang', 'Binlin Wu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Stokes shift spectroscopy and machine learning for label-free human prostate cancer detection.', 'Native fluorescence spectroscopy reveals spectral differences among prostate cancer cell lines with different risk levels.', 'Comparison of machine learning algorithms to predict clinically significant prostate cancer of the peripheral zone with multiparametric MRI using clinical assessment categories and radiomic features.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Advances in the computational and molecular understanding of the prostate cancer cell nucleus.', 'A Handheld Visible Resonance Raman Analyzer Used in Intraoperative Detection of Human Glioma.']"""

Unfortunately, it is difficult for existing drugs to fundamentally improve the sperm quality of OA patients, because the pathological mechanism of OA has not been fully elucidated yet. Morinda officinalis-Lycium barbarum coupled-herbs (MOLBCH), as traditional Chinese Medicines, has been widely used for treating OA over thousands of years, but its molecular mechanism is still unclear. For this purpose, we adopted a comprehensive approach integrated network pharmacology and molecular docking to reveal the bioactive components and potential targets of MOLBCH against OA. The results showed that MOLBCH alleviated apoptosis, promoted male reproductive function, and reduced oxidant stress in the treatment of OA. Ohioensin-A, quercetin, beta-sitosterol and sitosterol were the key bioactive components.

Most studies focus on hormone-resistance mechanisms related to androgen receptor mutations or to the acquired property of prostate cancer cells to over-activate signaling pathways. Tumor microenvironment plays a critical role in prostate cancer progression. However, the mechanism involving androgen/androgen receptor signaling in cancer associated fibroblasts and consequences for prostate cancer progression still remains elusive. We now report that prostate cancer associated fibroblasts express a transcriptional-incompetent androgen receptor. Upon androgen challenging, the receptor co-localizes with the scaffold protein filamin A in the extra-nuclear compartment of fibroblasts, thus mediating their migration and invasiveness. Cancer-associated fibroblasts move towards epithelial prostate cancer cells in 2D and 3D cultures, thereby inducing an increase of the prostate cancer organoid size. Androgen enhances both these effects through androgen receptor/filamin A complex assembly in cancer-associated fibroblasts. An androgen receptor-derived stapled peptide, which disrupts the androgen receptor/filamin A complex assembly, abolishes the androgen-dependent migration and invasiveness of cancer associated fibroblasts. Notably, the peptide impairs the androgen-induced invasiveness of CAFs in 2D models and reduces the overall tumor area in androgen-treated 3D co-culture. The androgen receptor in association with β1 integrin and membrane type-matrix metalloproteinase 1 activates a protease cascade triggering extracellular matrix remodeling. The peptide also impairs the androgen activation of this cascade. This study offers a potential new marker, the androgen receptor/filamin A complex, and a new therapeutic approach targeting intracellular pathways activated by the androgen/androgen receptor axis in prostate cancer-associated fibroblasts. Such a strategy, alone or in combination with conventional therapies, may allow a more efficient treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Marzia Di Donato', 'Alice Zamagni', 'Giovanni Galasso', 'Erika Di Zazzo', 'Pia Giovannelli', 'Maria Vittoria Barone', 'Michele Zanoni', 'Roberta Gunelli', 'Matteo Costantini', 'Ferdinando Auricchio', 'Antimo Migliaccio', 'Anna Tesei', 'Gabriella Castoria']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Correction to: The androgen receptor/filamin A complex as a target in prostate cancer microenvironment.', 'A Small Peptide Targeting the Ligand-Induced Androgen Receptor/Filamin a Interaction Inhibits the Invasive Phenotype of Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Androgen-induced cell migration: role of androgen receptor/filamin A association.', 'Role of non-genomic androgen signalling in suppressing proliferation of fibroblasts and fibrosarcoma cells.', 'Extranuclear partners of androgen receptor: at the crossroads of proliferation, migration, and neuritogenesis.', 'Molecular insights into prostate cancer progression: the missing link of tumor microenvironment.', 'Cellular specificity of androgen receptor, coregulators, and pioneer factors in prostate cancer.', 'ZY-444 inhibits the growth and metastasis of prostate cancer by targeting TNFAIP3 through TNF signaling pathway.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblasts promote malignant phenotypes of prostate cancer cells via autophagy : Cancer-associated fibroblasts promote prostate cancer development.', 'The nerve growth factor-delivered signals in prostate cancer and its associated microenvironment: when the dialogue replaces the monologue.', 'Cancer-Associated Fibroblast: Role in Prostate Cancer Progression to Metastatic Disease and Therapeutic Resistance.']"""

Experimental design:   SWOG S1216 is a phase III prospective randomized trial of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) combined with orteronel or bicalutamide for mCSPC. CellSearch CTC count was measured at registration (baseline). Prespecified CTC cut-off points of 0, 1-4, and ≥5 were correlated with baseline patient characteristics and, in a stratified subsample, were also correlated with two prespecified trial secondary endpoints: 7-month PSA ≤0.2 ng/mL versus 0.2-4.0 versus >4.0 (intermediate endpoint for overall survival); and progression-free survival (PFS) ≤ versus >2 years.  Results:   A total of 523 patients submitted baseline samples, and CTCs were detected (median 3) in 33%. Adjusting for two trial stratification factors (disease burden and timing of ADT initiation), men with undetectable CTCs had nearly nine times the odds of attaining 7-month PSA ≤ 0.2 versus > 4.0 [OR 8.8, 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.7-28.6, P < 0.001, N = 264] and four times the odds of achieving > 2 years PFS (OR 4.0, 95% CI, 1.9-8.5, P < 0.001, N = 336) compared with men with baseline CTCs ≥5.

Methods:   We included a subset of 118 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1986 and 2005 with whole-transcriptome gene expression profiling on tumor and adjacent normal prostate tissue and physical activity data. Long-term vigorous physical activity was self-reported as the average time spent engaged in various forms of recreational physical activity at baseline and biennially until prostate cancer diagnosis. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed among KEGG and Hallmark gene sets to identify pathways with differential expression based on vigorous physical activity.  Results:   In adjacent normal tissue, we identified 25 KEGG gene sets enriched (downregulated) in the highest compared with lowest quintile of vigorous physical activity at an FDR <0.10, including a number of cancer- and immune-related pathways. Although no gene sets reached statistical significance in tumor tissue, top gene sets differentially expressed included TGF beta, apoptosis, and p53 signaling pathways.

Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF-1) is a scaffold protein that has been involved both in tumor regulation and osteogenesis. We hypothesize that NHERF-1 modulation is a mechanism used by MINDIN to promote prostate cancer progression. We analyzed the expression of NHERF-1 and MINDIN in human prostate samples and in a premetastatic prostate cancer mouse model, based on the implantation of prostate adenocarcinoma TRAMP-C1 (transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate) cells in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice. The relationship between NHERF-1 and MINDIN and their effects on cell proliferation, migration, survival and osteomimicry were evaluated. Upregulation of MINDIN and downregulation of NHERF-1 expression were observed both in human prostate cancer samples and in the TRAMP-C1 model. MINDIN silencing restored NHERF-1 expression to control levels in the mouse model. Stimulation with MINDIN reduced NHERF-1 expression and triggered its mobilization from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm in TRAMP-C1 cells. MINDIN-dependent downregulation of NHERF-1 promoted tumor cell migration and proliferation without affecting osteomimicry and adhesion.

To determine the false-negative predictive value, we examined PCa detection after prior negative F-Bx.  Methods:   Between December 2012 and November 2016, 491 patients with suspected PCa and suspicious mpMRI findings underwent transrectal F-Bx. Patients with benign pathology (n = 191) were eligible for our follow-up (FU) survey. Patient characteristics and clinical parameters were correlated to subsequent findings of newly detected PCa.  Results:   Complete FU with a median of 31 (interquartile range: 17-39) months was available for 176/191 (92.2%) patients. Of those, 54 men had either surgical interventions on the prostate or re-Bxs. Newly detected PCa was evident in 14/176 (7.95%) patients stratified to ISUP ≤2 in 10 and ≥3 in 4 cases. The comparison of patients with newly detected PCa to those without cancerous findings in FU showed significant differences in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density (0.16 vs. 0.13 ng/mL2) and prostate volume (45 vs. 67 mL, both p < 0.05). Both factors are significant predictors for newly detected cancer after initial negative F-Bx.  Conclusion:   Only PSA density (>0.13 ng/mL2) and small prostate volume are significant predictors for newly detected PCa after initial negative F-Bx. Despite negative mpMRI/TRUS F-Bx results, patients should be further monitored due to a risk of developing PCa over time.

The recent introduction of hybrid MRI radiotherapy systems allows unequaled soft-tissue visualization during radiation delivery and can be used for dose reconstruction to quantify the impact of motion. To this end, knowledge of anatomical deformations obtained from continuous monitoring during treatment has to be combined with information on the spatio-temporal dose delivery to perform motion-compensated dose accumulation (MCDA). Here, the influence of the choice of deformable image registration algorithm, dose warping strategy, and magnetic resonance image resolution and signal-to-noise-ratio on the resulting MCDA is investigated. For a quantitative investigation, four 4D MRI-datasets representing typical patient observed motion patterns are generated using finite element modeling and serve as a gold standard. Energy delivery is simulated intra-fractionally in the deformed image space and, subsequently, MCDA-processed. Finally, the results are substantiated by comparing MCDA strategies on clinically acquired patient data. It is shown that MCDA is needed for correct quantitative dose reconstruction. For prostate treatments, using the energy per mass transfer dose warping strategy has the largest influence on decreasing dose estimation errors.""","""['L S Bosma', 'C Zachiu', 'M Ries', 'B Denis de Senneville', 'B W Raaymakers']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Retrospective study comparing MR-guided radiation therapy (MRgRT) setup strategies for prostate treatment: repositioning vs. replanning.', 'Development of multiorgan finite element-based prostate deformation model enabling registration of endorectal coil magnetic resonance imaging for radiotherapy planning.', 'Evaluations of an adaptive planning technique incorporating dose feedback in image-guided radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided Adaptive Radiation Therapy: A ""Game Changer"" for Prostate Treatment?', 'Advancing the treatment of localized prostate cancer with MR-guided radiotherapy.', 'Development of an abdominal dose accumulation tool and assessments of accumulated dose in gastrointestinal organs.']"""

Although the diagnosis of this disease is currently quite effective, there is still a need to search for noninvasive diagnostic and monitoring methods. Consequently, identifying the mechanisms underlying the development and progression of PCa is crucial. It has been confirmed that the hallmarks of PCa include changes in metabolism, particularly that of fatty acids. Therefore, the application of lipidomics with an accurate histopathological assessment can provide the necessary information and reveal the metabolites that are characteristic of the disease. The use of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples as an alternative matrix in retrospective research makes this approach highly innovative. The main goal of this study was to perform an untargeted lipidomic analysis of FFPE PCa tissue samples (n = 52) using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), in comparison to controls (n = 50). To our knowledge, this study is the first to simultaneously conduct a metabolic analysis and histopathological assessment. In the latter, the samples were evaluated based on Gleason grading score and pTNM stage. The obtained results were evaluated by univariate (Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test) as well as multivariate statistical analysis (principal component analysis, partial least squares-discriminant analysis, variable importance into projection, and selectivity ratio) in order to select the metabolites with the most discriminative power. Additionally, the correlation between the level of metabolites and pathological characteristics was determined. The results of the analyses confirmed the changes in the lipid metabolism pathway in PCa. It can be assumed that PCa is linked with elevated de novo biosynthesis of steroid hormone-related fatty acids and beta-oxidation of fatty acids. An increased level of three fatty acids, namely 9-octadecanoic acid, 9,12-octadecadienoic acid, and 5, 8, 1,14-eicosatetraenoic acid, was observed in the PCa samples. These fatty acids were assigned as metabolites with the best discriminative power for the two tested groups. In practice, these compounds could be considered as specific biochemical factors that may be implemented in the diagnosis of PCa, but their significance should be validated on a more extensive set of samples. Undoubtedly, these results are valuable as they provide important information on prostate cancerogenesis in the context of a metabolic switch.""","""['Magdalena Buszewska-Forajta', 'Joanna Raczak-Gutknecht', 'Małgorzata Artymowicz', 'Wojciech Wesołowski', 'Kamil Buczkowski', 'Ewa Iżycka-Świeszewska', 'Michał J Markuszewski']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Pharm Biomed Anal""","""['Plasma metabolomic profile in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer and associations with the prostate-specific antigen and the Gleason score.', 'Translational Metabolomics of Head Injury: Exploring Dysfunctional Cerebral Metabolism with Ex Vivo NMR Spectroscopy-Based Metabolite Quantification.', 'Optimized protocol for metabolomic and lipidomic profiling in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded kidney tissue by LC-MS.', 'An Optimized Method of Metabolite Extraction from Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded Tissue for GC/MS Analysis.', 'Prostate cancer diagnosis and characterization with mass spectrometry imaging.', 'Citric Acid as a Potential Prostate Cancer Biomarker Determined in Various Biological Samples.', 'Application of Mass Spectrometry in Pancreatic Cancer Translational Research.']"""

UMCD6 augmented killing of breast, lung, and prostate cancer cells through direct effects on both CD8+ T cells and NK cells, increasing cancer cell death and lowering cancer cell survival in vitro more robustly than monoclonal antibody checkpoint inhibitors that interrupt the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis.

Methods:   This phase III, single center, randomized controlled trial enrolled eligible patients undergoing radical radiotherapy for node-negative prostate adenocarcinoma, with estimated nodal risk ≥ 20%. Randomization was 1:1 to PORT (68 Gy/25# to prostate) or whole-pelvic radiotherapy (WPRT, 68 Gy/25# to prostate, 50 Gy/25# to pelvic nodes, including common iliac) using computerized stratified block randomization, stratified by Gleason score, type of androgen deprivation, prostate-specific antigen at diagnosis, and prior transurethral resection of the prostate. All patients received image-guided, intensity-modulated radiotherapy and minimum 2 years of androgen deprivation therapy. The primary end point was 5-year biochemical failure-free survival (BFFS), and secondary end points were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).  Results:   From November 2011 to August 2017, a total of 224 patients were randomly assigned (PORT = 114, WPRT = 110).

This study evaluated the efficacy of enzalutamide compared with bicalutamide, with planned subset analysis of Black patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC), which is a disease state responsive to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).  Objective:   To compare the efficacy of enzalutamide vs bicalutamide in combination with ADT in men with mHSPC, with a subset analysis of Black patients.  Design, setting, and participants:   In this randomized clinical trial, a phase 2 screening design enabled a nondefinitive comparison of the primary outcome by treatment. Patients were stratified by race (Black or other) and bone pain (present or absent). Accrual of at least 30% Black patients was required. This multicenter trial was conducted at 4 centers in the US. Men with mHSPC with no history of seizures and adequate marrow, renal, and liver function were eligible. Data analysis was performed from February 2019 to March 2020.  Interventions:   Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive oral enzalutamide (160 mg daily) or bicalutamide (50 mg daily) in addition to ADT.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary end point was the 7-month prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response (SMPR) rate, a previously accepted surrogate for overall survival (OS) outcome. Secondary end points included adverse reactions, time to PSA progression, and OS.  Results:   A total of 71 men (median [range] age, 65 [51-86] years) were enrolled; 29 (41%) were Black, 41 (58%) were White, and 1 (1%) was Asian. Thirty-six patients were randomized to receive enzalutamide, and 35 were randomized to receive bicalutamide. Twenty-six patients (37%) had bone pain and 37 patients (52%) had extensive disease. SMPR was achieved in 30 of 32 patients (94%; 95% CI, 80%-98%) taking enzalutamide and 17 of 26 patients (65%; 95% CI, 46%-81%) taking bicalutamide (P = .008) (difference, 29%; 95% CI, 5%-50%). Among Black patients, the SMPR was 93% (95% CI, 69%-99%) among those taking enzalutamide and 42% (95% CI, 19%-68%) among those taking bicalutamide (P = .009); among non-Black patients, the SMPR was 94% (95% CI, 74%-99%) among those taking enzalutamide and 86% (95% CI, 60%-96%) among those taking bicalutamide. The 12-month PSA response rates were 84% with enzalutamide and 34% with bicalutamide.  Conclusions and relevance:   The findings of this randomized clinical trial comparing enzalutamide with bicalutamide suggest that enzalutamide is associated with improved outcomes compared with bicalutamide, in terms of the rate and duration of PSA response, in Black patients with mHSPC.

However, most of the isolation methods of EVPs are time-consuming and complicated, and hence, sensitive detection and classification methods are required for EVPs. Here, we report a facile polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based method for isolating and classifying EVPs with label-free surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and pattern recognition algorithm. There are only three steps in the PEG-based isolation method, and it does not require ultracentrifugation, which makes it a low-cost and easy-to-use method. Three types of common male cancer cell lines, namely leukemia (THP-1), prostate cancer (DU-145), and colorectal cancer (COLO-205), and one healthy male blood sample, were utilized to isolate EVPs. To collect the SERS spectra of EVPs, a novel planar nanomaterial, namely amino molybdenum oxide (AMO) nanoflakes, was applied, with the enhancement factor being obtained as 3.2 × 102. Based on the principal component analysis and support vector machine (PCA-SVM) algorithm, cancer and normal EVPs were classified with 97.4% accuracy. However, among the cancer EVPs, the accuracy, precision, and sensitivity were found to be 90.0%, 90.9%, and 83.3% for THP-1; 86.7%, 80.0%, and 92.3% for DU-145; 96.7%, 83.3%, and 100% for COLO-205, respectively.

One emerging beta-emitting radioisotope of interest for therapy is 67Cu (t1/2: 2.6 d) due to its chemical equivalency with the widely-established positron-emitting isotope 64Cu (t1/2: 12.7 h). In this work we evaluate both the imaging and dosimetric characteristics of 67Cu, as well as producing the first report of SPECT/CT imaging using 67Cu. To this end, 67Cu was produced by photon-induced reactions on isotopically-enriched 68Zn at the Low-Energy Accelerator Facility (LEAF) of Argonne National Laboratory, followed by bulk separation of metallic 68Zn by sublimation and radiochemical purification by column chromatography. Gamma spectrometry was performed by efficiency-calibrated high-purity germanium (HPGe) analysis to verify absolute activity calibration and establish radionuclidic purity. Absolute activity measurements corroborated manufacturer-recommended dose-calibrator settings and no radionuclidic impurities were observed. Using the Clinical Trials Network anthropomorphic chest phantom, SPECT/CT images were acquired. Medium energy (ME) SPECT collimation was found to provide the best image quality from the primary 185 keV gamma emission of 67Cu. Reconstructed images of 67Cu were similar in quality to images acquired using 177Lu. Recovery coefficients were calculated and compared against quantitative images of 99mTc, 177Lu, and 64Cu within the same anthropomorphic chest phantom.

Patients and methods:   Retrospective multi-institutional analysis of mCRPC patients treated with SBRT to oligoprogressive lesions during ARTT. End-points were time to next-line systemic treatment (NEST), radiological progression-free survival (r-PFS) and overall survival (OS). Toxicity was registered according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, univariate and multivariate analysis (MVA) were performed.  Results:   Data from 34 patients were analyzed. Median NEST-free survival, r-PFS, and OS were 16.97, 13.47, and 38.3 months, respectively. At MVA, factors associated with worse NEST-free survival and r-PFS were polymetastatic burden at diagnosis of metastatic hormone-sensitive disease (hazard ratio [HR] 3.66, p = 0.009; HR 3.03, p = 0.034), PSA ≤ 7 ng/ml at mCRPC diagnosis (HR 0.23, p = 0.017; HR 0.19, p = 0.006) and PSADT ≤ 3 months at mCRPC diagnosis (HR 3.39, p = 0.026; HR 2.79, p = 0.037).

To reduce opioid use, we sought to develop an opioid-free regimen for RARP and determine perioperative outcomes before and after implementation. A retrospective, pre-post-interventional study was performed at a single institution between 8/2018 and 10/2019. An opioid-free pain regimen was developed and instituted on 3/7/2019, and all patients received preoperative counseling regarding pain expectations and management. Postoperative pain score was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included postoperative opioid use, length of stay, adverse events and unplanned health encounters within 30 days of discharge. Pearson's chi-squared and Student's t-tests were performed on categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Multivariable analysis was performed to determine risk factors for postoperative opioid use in the opioid-free cohort. A total of 89 patients were included for analysis; consisting of 47 (53%) pre-intervention and 42 (47%) post-intervention patients. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. A significantly lower proportion of patients in the post-intervention group were administered opioids postoperatively (5% vs 53%, p < 0.01), despite having similar postoperative pain scores (2.69 vs 3.11, p = 0.19) and length of stay (1.0 days vs 1.2 days, p = 0.07). The post-intervention group had a significantly lower rate of opioid discharge prescriptions (14% vs 96%, p < 0.01). The rate of ED visits (12% vs 15%, p = 0.68), pain-related phone calls (17% vs 19%, p = 0.76) or adverse events (19% vs 13%, p = 0.42) were similar between groups. Among the opioid-free group, older patients were less likely to be administered postoperative opioids (OR 0.84, p = 0.046). A structured opioid-free pain regimen following RARP is non-inferior compared to traditional opioid-based standard of care. Adoption of similar regimens can help address the ongoing opioid epidemic in the United States and future work is needed to apply these principles broadly.""","""['Zachary J Prebay', 'Robert Medairos', 'Truman Landowski', 'Ross G Everett', 'Johnathan Doolittle', 'Jagan K Kansal', 'Kenneth Jacobsohn', 'Scott C Johnson']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Robot Surg""","""['Impact of Combination of Local Anesthetic Wounds Infiltration and Ultrasound Transversus Abdominal Plane Block in Patients Undergoing Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Perioperative Results of a Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial.', 'Preventing Excess Narcotic Prescriptions in New Robotic Surgery Discharges: The PENN Prospective Cohort Quality Improvement Initiative.', 'Pure Single-site Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Using Single-port Versus Multiport Robotic Radical Prostatectomy: A Single-institution Comparative Study.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes between standard laparoscopic and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systemic review and meta-analysis.', 'Opioids in Urology: How Well Are We Preventing Opioid Dependence and How Can We Do Better?']"""

MicroRNA (miR)‑583 expression levels have been discovered to be downregulated in recurrent PCa samples compared with non‑recurrent cases. However, the precise functions and pathogenic mechanism of miR‑583 in the development of PCa are vague, thus the aim of the present study was to investigate these. The expression levels of miR‑583 and Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) in PCa tissues and cell lines were analyzed using reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR and western blotting. The protein expression levels of phosphorylated (p)‑STAT3 and STAT3 in PCa cell lines were also analyzed using western blotting. The effects of miR‑583 and JAK1 on the proliferation and invasion of PCa cell lines cell lines were determined using MTT and Transwell assays, respectively. The binding interaction between miR‑583 and the 3'‑untranslated region of JAK1 were predicted by TargetScan, and further validated using dual luciferase reporter assays in PCa cell lines. The results revealed that the expression levels of miR‑583 were downregulated, while those of JAK1 were upregulated in PCa tissues and cell lines (DU145 and PC3). The transfection with the miR‑583 mimic inhibited the proliferation and invasion, as well as downregulating JAK1 and p‑STAT3 protein expression levels in DU145 and PC3 cell lines. These effects were partially abolished following the overexpression of JAK1. Moreover, JAK1 was identified to be a target gene for miR‑583 in DU145 and PC3 cell lines and the expression levels of miR‑583 were revealed to be negatively correlated with JAK1 expression levels in PCa tissues. In conclusion, the findings of the present study suggested that miR‑583 may inhibit the proliferation and invasion of PCa cells by targeting JAK1, thus providing a novel therapeutic target for patients with PCa.""","""['Zhongyi Li', 'Jianheng Chen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['TERF1 downregulation promotes the migration and invasion of the PC3 prostate cancer cell line as a target of miR‑155.', 'The tumor-suppressive microRNA-143/145 cluster inhibits cell migration and invasion by targeting GOLM1 in prostate cancer.', 'miR‑19a‑3p targets PMEPA1 and induces prostate cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion.', 'MiR-769-5p inhibits cancer progression in oral squamous cell carcinoma by directly targeting JAK1/STAT3 pathway.', 'MicroRNA‑195‑5p is associated with cell proliferation, migration and invasion in prostate cancer and targets MIB1.', 'Identification and validation of miR-583 and mir-877-5p as biomarkers in patients with breast cancer: an integrated experimental and bioinformatics research.', ""STAT3 and Its Pathways' Dysregulation-Underestimated Role in Urological Tumors."", 'Effects of Cyclosporine A and Adalimumab on the expression profiles histaminergic system-associated genes and microRNAs regulating these genes in HaCaT cells.', 'circFCHO2 promotes gastric cancer progression by activating the JAK1/STAT3 pathway via sponging miR-194-5p.', 'Pharmacological Effects of Polyphenol Phytochemicals on the JAK-STAT Signaling Pathway.']"""

Methods:   In men with hormone sensitive PC (HSPC, n = 43) or metastatic castration-resistant PC (mCRPC, n = 22) or CON (n = 37), relative and absolute lean and fat mass, physical function (6 m walk, chair stands, timed up and go [TUG], stair climb), and QoL were determined.  Results:   Relative body composition differed amongst all groups, along with ~39% greater absolute fat mass in mCRPC vs. CON. TUG and chair stands were ~71% and ~33% slower in mCRPC compared to both CON and HSPC, whereas stair climb was ~29% and 6 m walk was ~18% slower in mCRPC vs. CON. Relative body composition was correlated with physical function (r = 0.259-0.385). Clinically relevant differences for mCRPC were observed for overall QoL and several subscales vs. CON, although body composition and physical function did not influence QoL.  Conclusions:   PC progression is associated with deteriorations in body composition and physical function.

However, not all patients respond to AA, and AA resistance ultimately develops in patients who initially respond. We aimed to identify AA resistance mechanisms in prostate cancer cells.  Experimental design:   We established several AA-resistant cell lines and performed a comprehensive study on mechanisms involved in AA resistance development. RNA sequencing and phospho-kinase array screenings were performed to discover that the cAMP-response element CRE binding protein 1 (CREB1) was a critical molecule in AA resistance development.  Results:   The drug-resistant cell lines are phenotypically stable without drug selection, and exhibit permanent global gene expression changes. The phosphorylated CREB1 (pCREB1) is increased in AA-resistant cell lines and is critical in controlling global gene expression. Upregulation of pCREB1 desensitized prostate cancer cells to AA, while blocking CREB1 phosphorylation resensitized AA-resistant cells to AA. AA treatment increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, induces kinases activity, and leads to the phosphorylation of CREB1, which may subsequently augment the essential role of the CBP/p300 complex in AA-resistant cells because AA-resistant cells exhibit a relatively higher sensitivity to CBP/p300 inhibitors. Further pharmacokinetics studies demonstrated that AA significantly synergizes with CBP/p300 inhibitors in limiting the growth of prostate cancer cells.  Conclusions:   Our studies suggest that AA treatment upregulates pCREB1, which enhances CBP/p300 activity, leading to global gene expression alterations, subsequently resulting in drug resistance development. Combining AA with therapies targeting resistance mechanisms may provide a more effective treatment strategy.""","""['Wenting Pan', 'Zhouwei Zhang', 'Hannah Kimball', 'Fangfang Qu', 'Kyler Berlind', 'Konrad H Stopsack', 'Gwo-Shu Mary Lee', 'Toni K Choueiri', 'Philip W Kantoff']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Abiraterone acetate in the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Selective roles for cAMP response element-binding protein binding protein and p300 protein as coregulators for androgen-regulated gene expression in advanced prostate cancer cells.', 'Identification of mechanisms of resistance to treatment with abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).', 'Inhibition of the acetyltransferases p300 and CBP reveals a targetable function for p300 in the survival and invasion pathways of prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: targeting the mechanisms of resistance to abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide.', 'A short peptide LINC00665_18aa encoded by lncRNA LINC00665 suppresses the proliferation and migration of osteosarcoma cells through the regulation of the CREB1/RPS6KA3 interaction.', 'Circ-CREBBP inhibits sperm apoptosis via the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway by sponging miR-10384 and miR-143-3p.', 'Tuftelin 1 Facilitates Hepatocellular Carcinoma Progression through Regulation of Lipogenesis and Focal Adhesion Maturation.', 'Design, Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Prodrugs of 666-15 as Inhibitors of CREB-Mediated Gene Transcription.', 'Activation of ABCC Genes by Cisplatin Depends on the CoREST Occurrence at Their Promoters in A549 and MDA-MB-231 Cell Lines.']"""

Methods:   HAROW (2008-2013) was designed as a noninterventional, prospective, health-service research study for patients with localized prostate cancer (≤cT2), including patients with IPC (cT1a/b). A follow-up examination of all patients treated with AS was carried out. Overall, cancer-specific, and metastasis-free survival and discontinuation rates were determined.  Results:   Of 210 IPC patients, 68 opted for AS and were available for evaluation. Fifty-four patients had cT1a category and 14 cT1b category. Median follow-up was 7.7 years (IQR: 5.7-9.1). Eight patients died of which 6 were still under AS or watchful waiting (WW). No PCa-specific death could be observed. One patient developed metastasis. Twenty-three patients (33.8%) discontinued AS changing to invasive treatment: 12 chose radical prostatectomy, 7 radiotherapy, and 4 hormonal treatment. Another 19 patients switched to WW. The Kaplan-Meier estimated 10-year overall, cancer-specific, metastasis-free, and intervention-free survival was 83.8% (95% CI: 72.2-95.3), 100%, 98.4% (95% CI: 95.3-99.9), and 61.0% (95% CI: 47.7-74.3), respectively. In multivariable analysis, age (RR: 0.97; p < 0.001), PSA density ≥0.2 ng/mL2 (RR: 13.23; p < 0.001), and PSA ≥1.0 ng/mL after surgery (RR: 5.19; p = 0.016) were significantly predictive for receiving an invasive treatment.  Conclusion:   In comparison with other AS series with a general low-risk prostate cancer population, our study confirmed the promising survival outcomes for IPC patients, whereas discontinuation rates seem to be lower for IPC.

Both prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT and ferumoxtran-10 nanoparticle-enhanced MRI (nano-MRI) are imaging modalities with high potential to identify LN metastases in PCa patients. The aim of this study was to compare the results of these imaging technologies in terms of characteristics and anatomic localization of suspicious LNs in order to assess the feasibility of their complementary use for imaging in PCa patients. Methods: In total, 45 patients with either primary PCa (n = 8) or recurrence (n = 36) were included in this retrospective study. All patients underwent both 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT and nano-MRI between October 2015 and July 2017 within 3 wk. Both scans were performed at the same institution according to local clinical protocols. All scans were analyzed independently by experienced nuclear medicine physicians and radiologists. The size, anatomic location, and level of suspicion were determined for all visible LNs. Subsequently, the findings from 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT and nano-MRI were compared without respect to a reference standard. Results: In total, 179 suspicious LNs were identified. Significantly more suspicious LNs per patient were detected by nano-MRI (P < 0.001): 160 were identified in 33 patients by nano-MRI, versus 71 in 25 patients by 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT. Of all suspicious LNs, 108 were identified only by nano-MRI (60%), 19 (11%) only by 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT, and 52 (29%) by both methods. The mean size of the suspicious LNs as identified by nano-MRI was significantly smaller (5.3 mm) than that by 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT (6.0 mm; P = 0.006). The median level of suspicion did not differ significantly. Both modalities identified suspicious LNs in all anatomic regions of the pelvis. Conclusion: Both modalities identified suspicious LNs that were missed by the other. Both modalities identified suspicious LNs in all anatomic regions of the pelvis; however, nano-MRI appeared to be superior in detecting smaller suspicious LNs.

However, 18F-FDHT is rapidly metabolized in humans and excreted via the kidneys into the urine, potentially compromising the detection of tumor lesions close to the prostate. Enzalutamide is an AR signaling inhibitor currently used in different stages of prostate cancer. Enzalutamide and its primary metabolite N-desmethylenzalutamide have an AR affinity comparable to that of FDHT but are excreted mainly via the hepatic route. Radiolabeled enzalutamide could thus be a suitable candidate PET tracer for AR imaging. Here, we describe the radiolabeling of enzalutamide with 18F. Moreover, the in vitro and in vivo behavior of 18F-enzalutamide was evaluated and compared with the current standard, 18F-FDHT. Methods:18F-enzalutamide was obtained by fluorination of the nitro precursor. In vitro cellular uptake studies with 18F-enzalutamide and 18F-FDHT were performed in LNCaP (AR-positive) and HEK293 (AR-negative) cells. Competition assays with both tracers were conducted on the LNCaP (AR-positive) cell line. In vivo PET imaging, ex vivo biodistribution, and metabolite studies with 18F-enzalutamide and 18F-FDHT were conducted on athymic nude male mice bearing an LNCaP xenograft in the shoulder. Results:18F-enzalutamide was obtained in 1.4% ± 0.9% radiochemical yield with an apparent molar activity of 6.2 ± 10.3 GBq/µmol. 18F-FDHT was obtained in 1.5% ± 0.8% yield with a molar activity of more than 25 GBq/µmol. Coincubation with an excess of 5α-dihydrotestosterone or enzalutamide significantly reduced the cellular uptake of 18F-enzalutamide and 18F-FDHT to about 50% in AR-positive LNCaP cells but not in AR-negative HEK293 cells. PET and biodistribution studies on male mice bearing a LnCaP xenograft showed about 3 times higher tumor uptake for 18F-enzalutamide than for 18F-FDHT. Sixty minutes after tracer injection, 93% of 18F-enzalutamide in plasma was still intact, compared with only 3% of 18F-FDHT. Conclusion: Despite its lower apparent molar activity, 18F-enzalutamide shows higher tumor uptake and better metabolic stability than 18F-FDHT and thus seems to have more favorable properties for imaging of AR with PET. However, further evaluation in other oncologic animal models and patients is warranted to confirm these results.""","""['Inês F Antunes', 'Rutger J Dost', 'Hilde D Hoving', 'Aren van Waarde', 'Rudi A J O Dierckx', 'Douwe F Samplonius', 'Wijnand Helfrich', 'Philip H Elsinga', 'Erik F J de Vries', 'Igle J de Jong']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Specific 18F-FDHT Accumulation in Human Prostate Cancer Xenograft Murine Models Is Facilitated by Prebinding to Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin.', 'In vivo imaging of brain androgen receptors in rats: a (18)FFDHT PET study.', 'Pharmacokinetic assessment of the uptake of 16beta-18F-fluoro-5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (FDHT) in prostate tumors as measured by PET.', 'PET Imaging Agents (FES, FFNP, and FDHT) for Estrogen, Androgen, and Progesterone Receptors to Improve Management of Breast and Prostate Cancers by Functional Imaging.', 'Current applications of PET imaging of sex hormone receptors with a fluorinated analogue of estradiol or of testosterone.', 'Androgen Receptor Imaging in the Management of Hormone-Dependent Cancers with Emphasis on Prostate Cancer.', 'Nuclear Receptor Imaging In Vivo-Clinical and Research Advances.', 'Will extended field-of-view PET/CT depopulate the graveyard of failed PET radiopharmaceuticals?']"""

The purpose of this analysis was to report the final results for management decision changes based on 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT findings and determine whether the decision change trend remained after completion of accrual. Methods: Patients with detectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after prostatectomy were randomized to undergo either conventional imaging (CI) only (arm A) or CI plus 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT (arm B) before radiotherapy. In arm B, positivity rates on CI and 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT for detection of recurrent PCa were determined. Final decisions on whether to offer radiotherapy and whether to include only the prostate bed or also the pelvis in the radiotherapy field were based on 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT findings. Radiotherapy decisions before and after 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT were compared. The statistical significance of decision changes was determined using the Clopper-Pearson (exact) binomial method. Prognostic factors were compared between patients with and without decision changes. Results: All 165 patients enrolled in the study had standard-of-care CI and were initially planned to receive radiotherapy. Sixty-three of 79 (79.7%) patients (median PSA, 0.33 ng/mL) who underwent 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT (arm B) had positive findings. 18F-Fluciclovine PET/CT had a significantly higher positivity rate than CI did for the whole body (79.7% vs. 13.9%; P < 0.001), prostate bed (69.6% vs. 5.1%; P < 0.001), and pelvic lymph nodes (38.0% vs. 10.1%; P < 0.001). Twenty-eight of 79 (35.4%) patients had the overall radiotherapy decision changed after 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT; in 4 of 79 (5.1%), the decision to use radiotherapy was withdrawn because of extrapelvic disease detected on 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT. In 24 of 75 (32.0%) patients with a final decision to undergo radiotherapy, the radiotherapy field was changed. Changes in overall radiotherapy decisions and radiotherapy fields were statistically significant (P < 0.001). Overall, the mean PSA at PET was significantly different between patients with and without radiotherapy decision changes (P = 0.033).

In males, prostate cancer is ranked second as leading cause of death out of more than 200 different cancer types1. As a result, early detection of cancer can cause a significant reduction in mortality. PSA concentration directly is related to prostate cancer, so normal serum concentrations in healthy means are 4 ng and above 10 ng as abnormal concentration. Therefore, PSA determination is important to cancer progression. In this study, a free label electrochemical immunosensor was prepared based on a new green platform for the quantitative detection of the PSA. The used platform was formed from quince seed mucilage containing green gold and silver nanoparticles and synthesized by the green method (using Calendula officinalis L. extract). The quince mucilage biopolymer was used as a sub layer to assemble nanoparticles and increase the electrochemical performance. This nanocomposite was used to increase the antibody loading and accelerate the electron transfer, which can increase the biosensor sensitivity. The antibodies of the PSA biomarker were successfully incubated on the green platform. Under the optimal conditions, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was proportional to the PSA biomarker concentration from 0.1 pg mL-1 to 100 ng mL-1 with low limit of detection (0.078 pg mL-1). The proposed green immunosensor exhibited high stability and reproducibility, which can be used for the quantitative assay of the PSA biomarker in clinical analyses.

Patients with Gleason ≤7 (3+4) disease (low and intermediate risk) under active surveillance were enrolled in a 3+3 study with three eRapa dosing cohorts (cohort 1, 0.5 mg/week; cohort 2, 1 mg/week; and cohort 3, 0.5 mg/day). Patients were treated for 3 months and followed for an additional 3 months to assess safety, pharmacokinetics, quality of life (QoL), immune response, and disease progression. Fourteen patients (cohort 1, n = 3; cohort 2, n = 3; and cohort 3, n = 8) were enrolled. In cohort 3, one dose-limiting toxicity (DLT; neutropenia) and two non-DLT grade 1-2 adverse events (AE) occurred that resulted in patient withdrawal. All AEs in cohorts 1 and 2 were grade 1. Peak serum rapamycin concentration was 7.1 ng/mL after a 1 mg dose. Stable trough levels (∼2 ng/mL) developed after 48-72 hours. Daily dosing mildly worsened QoL, although QoL recovered after treatment cessation in all categories, except fatigue. Weekly dosing increased naïve T-cell populations. Daily dosing increased central memory cell populations and exhaustion markers. No disease progression was observed. In conclusion, treatment with eRapa was safe and well-tolerated. Daily dosing produced higher frequencies of lower grade toxicities and transient worsening of QoL, while weekly dosing impacted immune response. Future studies will verify clinical benefit and long-term tolerability.Prevention Relevance: There is an unmet medical need for a well-tolerated treatment capable of delaying progression of newly diagnosed low-grade prostate cancer.

The aim of this study was therefore to spatially detect metabolites and lipids on prostate tissue sections by using mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), a method that facilitates molecular imaging of heterogeneous tissue sections, which can subsequently be related to the histology of the same section.  Methods:   Here, we simultaneously obtained metabolic and lipidomic profiles in different prostate tissue types using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MSI. Both positive and negative ion mode were applied to analyze consecutive sections from 45 fresh-frozen human prostate tissue samples (N = 15 patients). Mass identification was performed with tandem MS.  Results:   Pairwise comparisons of cancer, non-cancer epithelium, and stroma revealed several metabolic differences between the tissue types. We detected increased levels of metabolites crucial for lipid metabolism in cancer, including metabolites involved in the carnitine shuttle, which facilitates fatty acid oxidation, and building blocks needed for lipid synthesis. Metabolites associated with healthy prostate functions, including citrate, aspartate, zinc, and spermine had lower levels in cancer compared to non-cancer epithelium. Profiling of stroma revealed higher levels of important energy metabolites, such as ADP, ATP, and glucose, and higher levels of the antioxidant taurine compared to cancer and non-cancer epithelium.  Conclusions:   This study shows that specific tissue compartments within prostate cancer samples have distinct metabolic profiles and pinpoint the advantage of methodology providing spatial information compared to bulk analysis.

The HOXB13/HOXA11-AS axis also regulated integrin subunits (ITGAV and ITGB1) specific to prostate cancer bone metastasis. HOXB13, in combination with HOXA11-AS, directly regulated the integrin-binding sialoprotein (IBSP) promoter. Furthermore, conditioned medium containing HOXA11-AS secreted from PC3 cells could induce the expression of CCL2 and IBSP in SaOS2 osteoblastic cells.

One such technique, magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF), has significant competitive advantages over conventional mapping techniques in terms of its multi-site reproducibility, short scanning time and inherent robustness to motion. It has also been shown to improve the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer when added to standard mpMRI sequences, however, the existing studies have all been conducted on 3.0 T MRI systems, limiting the technique's use on 1.5 T MRI scanners that are still more widely used for prostate imaging across the globe. The aim of this proof-of-concept study was, therefore, to evaluate the cross-system reproducibility of prostate MRF T1 in healthy volunteers (HVs) using 1.5 and 3.0 T MRI systems. The initial validation of MRF T1 against gold standard inversion recovery fast spin echo (IR-FSE) T1 in the ISMRM/NIST MRI system revealed a strong linear correlation between phantom-derived MRF and IR-FSE T1 values was observed at both field strengths (R2 = 0.998 at 1.5T and R2 = 0.993 at 3T; p = < 0.0001 for both). In young HVs, inter-scanner CVs demonstrated marginal differences across all tissues with the highest difference of 3% observed in fat (2% at 1.5T vs 5% at 3T). At both field strengths, MRF T1 could confidently differentiate prostate peripheral zone from transition zone, which highlights the high quantitative potential of the technique given the known difficulty of tissue differentiation in this age group. The high cross-system reproducibility of MRF T1 relaxometry of the healthy prostate observed in this preliminary study, therefore, supports the technique's prospective clinical validation as part of larger trials employing 1.5 T MRI systems, which are still widely used clinically for routine mpMRI of the prostate.""","""['Nikita Sushentsev', 'Joshua D Kaggie', 'Rhys A Slough', 'Bruno Carmo', 'Tristan Barrett']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Quantitative imaging metrics derived from magnetic resonance fingerprinting using ISMRM/NIST MRI system phantom: An international multicenter repeatability and reproducibility study.', 'The effect of gadolinium-based contrast agent administration on magnetic resonance fingerprinting-based T1 relaxometry in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Comprehensive Evaluation of B1+-corrected FISP-based Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting: Accuracy, Repeatability and Reproducibility of T1 and T2 Relaxation Times for ISMRM/NIST System Phantom and Volunteers.', 'MR fingerprinting of the prostate.', 'Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting: Technical Developments and Initial Clinical Validation.', 'Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting: A Review of Clinical Applications.', 'Multicenter Repeatability and Reproducibility of MR Fingerprinting in Phantoms and in Prostatic Tissue.', 'Current Applications and Future Development of Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting in Diagnosis, Characterization, and Response Monitoring in Cancer.']"""

However, tumors become ADT-resistant, and there is a need to understand the mechanism. One possible mechanism is the upregulation of AR co-regulators, although only a handful have been definitively linked to disease. We previously identified the Mediator subunit MED19 as an AR co-regulator, and reported that MED19 depletion inhibits AR transcriptional activity and growth of androgen-insensitive LNCaP-abl cells. Therefore, we proposed that MED19 upregulation would promote AR activity and drive androgen-independent growth. Here, we show that stable overexpression of MED19 in androgen-dependent LNCaP cells promotes growth under conditions of androgen deprivation. To delineate the mechanism, we determined the MED19 and AR transcriptomes and cistromes in control and MED19-overexpressing LNCaP cells. We also examined genome-wide H3K27 acetylation. MED19 overexpression selectively alters AR occupancy, H3K27 acetylation, and gene expression. Under conditions of androgen deprivation, genes regulated by MED19 correspond to genes regulated by ELK1, a transcription factor that binds the AR N-terminus to induce select AR target gene expression and proliferation, and genomic sites occupied by MED19 and AR are enriched for motifs associated with ELK1. Strikingly, MED19 upregulates expression of monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), a factor that promotes prostate cancer growth. MAOA depletion reduces androgen-independent growth. MED19 and AR occupy the MAOA promoter, with MED19 overexpression enhancing AR occupancy and H3K27 acetylation. Furthermore, MED19 overexpression increases ELK1 occupancy at the MAOA promoter, and ELK1 depletion reduces MAOA expression and androgen-independent growth. This suggests that MED19 cooperates with ELK1 to regulate AR occupancy and H3K27 acetylation at MAOA, upregulating its expression and driving androgen independence in prostate cancer cells. This study provides important insight into the mechanisms of prostate cancer cell growth under low androgen, and underscores the importance of the MED19-MAOA axis in this process.""","""['Hannah Weber', 'Rachel Ruoff', 'Michael J Garabedian']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""PLoS Genet""","""['The ETS domain transcription factor ELK1 directs a critical component of growth signaling by the androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells.', 'Effect of Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) inhibitors on androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'The Amino-terminal Domain of the Androgen Receptor Co-opts Extracellular Signal-regulated Kinase (ERK) Docking Sites in ELK1 Protein to Induce Sustained Gene Activation That Supports Prostate Cancer Cell Growth.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Monoamine oxidase A: An emerging therapeutic target in prostate cancer.', 'From Omics to Multi-Omics Approaches for In-Depth Analysis of the Molecular Mechanisms of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Online Real-time Benchmarking Information Technology for RadioTherapy (ORBIT-RT) provides a free, web-based platform for knowledge-based dose estimation that can be used by clinicians worldwide to benchmark the quality of their radiotherapy plans.  Materials and methods:   The ORBIT-RT platform was developed to satisfy four primary design criteria: web-based access, TPS independence, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliance, and autonomous operation. ORBIT-RT uses a cloud-based server to automatically anonymize a user's Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine for RadioTherapy (DICOM-RT) file before upload and processing of the case. From there, ORBIT-RT uses established knowledge-based dose-volume histogram (DVH) estimation methods to autonomously create DVH estimations for the uploaded DICOM-RT. ORBIT-RT performance was evaluated with an independent validation set of 45 volumetric modulated arc therapy prostate plans with two key metrics: (i) accuracy of the DVH estimations, as quantified by their error, DVHclinical - DVHprediction and (ii) time to process and display the DVH estimations on the ORBIT-RT platform.  Results:   ORBIT-RT organ DVH predictions show < 1% bias and 3% error uncertainty at doses > 80% of prescription for the prostate validation set. The ORBIT-RT extensions require 3.0 seconds per organ to analyze. The DICOM upload, data transfer, and DVH output display extend the entire system workflow to 2.5-3 minutes.  Conclusion:   ORBIT-RT demonstrated fast and fully autonomous knowledge-based feedback on a web-based platform that takes only anonymized DICOM-RT as input.

This is followed by a registration stage using first an iterative closest point (ICP) for localizing the connected set of seeds (named strand) inserted through a needle, and secondly refining each seed position using sum of squared differences (SSD) as a similarity criterion. ICP registers a geometric model of the strand to the candidate voxels while SSD compares an appearance model of a single seed to a subset of the image. The method was evaluated both for 3D images of an Agar-agar phantom and a dataset of clinical 3D images. It was tested on stranded and on loose seeds.  Results:   Results on phantom and clinical images were compared with a manual localization giving mean errors of 1.09 ± 0.61 mm on phantom image and 1.44 ± 0.45 mm on clinical images. On clinical images, the mean errors of individual seeds orientation was 4.33 ± 8 . 51 ∘ .  Conclusions:   The proposed algorithm for radioactive seed localization is robust, tested on different US images, accurate, giving small mean error values, and returns the five cylindrical seeds degrees of freedom.""","""['Hatem Younes', 'Jocelyne Troccaz', 'Sandrine Voros']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['EM-enhanced US-based seed detection for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Automated localization of implanted seeds in 3D TRUS images used for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Automatic detection of brachytherapy seeds in 3D ultrasound images using a convolutional neural network.', 'Therapeutic applications of radioactive sources: from image-guided brachytherapy to radio-guided surgical resection.', 'Recent Advances in Brachytherapy Using Radioactive Nanoparticles: An Alternative to Seed-Based Brachytherapy.', 'Dose uncertainty due to needle-tip localization error in prostate seed implantation.', 'Automatic estimation of knee effusion from limited MRI data.']"""

A critical unmet need in clinical management of PCa is discovery and characterization of the molecular drivers of aggressive tumours. The development and progression of aggressive PCa involve genetic and epigenetic alterations occurring in the germline, somatic (tumour), and epigenomes. To date, interactions between genes containing germline, somatic, and epigenetic mutations in aggressive PCa have not been characterized. The objective of this investigation was to elucidate the genomic-epigenomic interaction landscape in aggressive PCa to identify potential drivers aggressive PCa and the pathways they control. We hypothesized that aggressive PCa originates from a complex interplay between genomic (both germline and somatic mutations) and epigenomic alterations. We further hypothesized that these complex arrays of interacting genomic and epigenomic factors affect gene expression, molecular networks, and signaling pathways which in turn drive aggressive PCa.  Methods:   We addressed these hypotheses by performing integrative data analysis combining information on germline mutations from genome-wide association studies with somatic and epigenetic mutations from The Cancer Genome Atlas using gene expression as the intermediate phenotype.  Results:   The investigation revealed signatures of genes containing germline, somatic, and epigenetic mutations associated with aggressive PCa. Aberrant DNA methylation had effect on gene expression. In addition, the investigation revealed molecular networks and signalling pathways enriched for germline, somatic, and epigenetic mutations including the STAT3, PTEN, PCa, ATM, AR, and P53 signalling pathways implicated in aggressive PCa.

Metastatic spermatic cord tumors are even rarer. Several studies have revealed that the most frequent primary tumors metastasizing to the spermatic cord and peritesticular tissues are neoplasms of the stomach and prostate. Furthermore, metastasis to the spermatic cord or epididymis may occur via retrograde lymphatic and hematic routes. We present the case of a man with gastric cancer that metastasized to the spermatic cord and epididymis, with concomitant ipsilateral hydronephrosis after surgical resection and chemotherapy for his primary tumor.  Case summary:   A 71-year-old man underwent total gastrectomy for pT4aN2 poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma in December 2016. Two months after surgery, he received adjuvant chemotherapy with TS-1 from February 2017 to February 2018. Surveillance computed tomography (CT) was performed in June 2018, which did not reveal any sign of tumor recurrence. In November 2019, he presented with left lower quadrant abdominal pain and a palpable left inguinal-scrotal mass. CT revealed left mild hydronephrosis and a left scrotal mass measuring 4.0 cm × 1.7 cm. Tumor biomarkers, including alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (βHCG), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) were all normal. Renal and testicular echography showed left hydronephrosis and a left peritesticular soft tissue lesion with blood flow. Diagnostic ureteroscopy showed left lower ureter narrowing without an intraluminal lesion. A biopsy was obtained for the indurated spermatic cord and epididymis, which showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that the tumor was diffusely and strongly positive for homeobox protein CDX2. The features were consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma of a primary gastric tumor.  Conclusion:   In patients with a history of primary cancer, an inguinal mass of unknown cause with accompanying ipsilateral hydronephrosis may be a sign of distant metastasis from a primary tumor, especially of gastrointestinal origin.""","""['Shu-Han Tsao', 'Cheng-Keng Chuang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""World J Clin Cases""","""['Metastasis of the epididymis and spermatic cord from pancreatic adenocarcinoma: A rare entity.

It is far from over and yet, it has affected every aspect of human life. The Department of Urology at King's College Hospital London provides all types of urology care ranging from benign to cancer treatments to the community. However, this service was badly affected by COVID-19. Policies were made by the experts in the field to reduce patient traffic in the hospital and at the same time, attempting to ensure appropriate and timely treatment was provided to patients suffering from urological conditions requiring urgent attention. In this article, we discuss the triage guidelines set up at our centre. Treatments for benign conditions such as kidney stones were delayed for 3-6 months. For the first time, telephone and video clinics were setup to follow-up patients with benign conditions. Urological emergencies such as acute urinary retention and priapism were discharged from accidental and emergency department after treatment. Small T1 renal cancers were put on surveillance, whereas T2 and T3 renal cancers were offered nephrectomy at a COVID-free specialized center. Transurethral removal of bladder tumor was offered only for solid or actively bleeding tumor. High risk prostate cancer patients were started on hormonal therapy and radiotherapy was only offered for spinal cord compression secondary to metastasis. Low and intermediate non-metastatic prostate cancers were placed on active surveillance. Patients with testicular tumor continued to have immediate inguinal orchidectomy. The multi-disciplinary meetings were done remotely using blue jeans software®.

Development of a fluorinated glucose analog, fluorodeoxyglucose, labelled with a β+ emitter fluorine-18 (18F-FDG), made it possible to image cellular targets with high glycolytic metabolism. These targets include cancer cells based on increased aerobic metabolism due to the Warburg effect, and thus, 18F-FDG is a staple in nuclear medicine clinics globally.

In contrast to SUVs, the TBR accounts for variability in arterial input functions caused by differences in total tumor burden between patients (the sink effect). However, TBR depends strongly on tracer uptake interval and has worse repeatability and is less applicable in clinical practice than SUVs. We investigated whether SUV could provide adequate quantification of 18F-DCFPyL uptake on PET/CT in a patient cohort with low PCa burden. Methods: In total, 116 patients with PCa undergoing 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging were retrospectively included. All 18F-DCFPyL-avid lesions suspected of being PCa were semiautomatically delineated. SUVpeak was plotted against TBR for the most intense lesion of each patient. The correlation of SUVpeak and TBR was evaluated using linear regression and was stratified for patients undergoing PET/CT for primary staging, patients undergoing restaging at biochemical recurrence, and patients with metastatic castration-resistant PCa. Moreover, the correlation was evaluated as a function of tracer uptake time, prostate-specific antigen level, and PET-positive tumor volume. Results: In total, 436 lesions were delineated (median, 1 per patient; range, 1-66). SUVpeak correlated well with TBR in patients with PCa and a total tumor volume of less than 200 cm3 (R2 = 0.931). The correlation between SUV and TBR was not affected by disease setting, prostate-specific antigen level, or tumor volume. SUVpeak depended less on tracer uptake time than did TBR. Conclusion: For 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT, SUVpeak correlates strongly with TBR. Therefore, it is a valuable simplified, semiquantitative measurement in patients with low-volume PCa (<200 cm3). SUVpeak can therefore be applied in 18F-DCFPyL PET assessment as an imaging biomarker to characterize tumors and to monitor treatment outcomes.""","""['Yves J L Bodar', 'Berend P F Koene', 'Bernard H E Jansen', 'Matthijs C F Cysouw', 'Dennie Meijer', 'N Harry Hendrikse', 'André N Vis', 'Ronald Boellaard', 'Daniela E Oprea-Lager']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Simplified Methods for Quantification of 18F-DCFPyL Uptake in Patients with Prostate Cancer.', 'Repeatability of Quantitative 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT Measurements in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Healthy Tissue Uptake of 68Ga-Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen, 18F-DCFPyL, 18F-Fluoromethylcholine, and 18F-Dihydrotestosterone.', '18FDCFPyL PET/CT for Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', 'Prospective analysis of clinically significant prostate cancer detection with 18FDCFPyL PET/MRI compared to multiparametric MRI: a comparison with the histopathology in the radical prostatectomy specimen, the ProStaPET study.', 'Piflufolastat F 18: Diagnostic First Approval.']"""

Here we demonstrate that IGF1R inhibition generates endogenous DNA lesions protected by 53BP1 bodies, indicating under-replicated DNA. In cancer cells, inhibition or depletion of IGF1R delayed replication fork progression accompanied by activation of ATR-CHK1 signaling and the intra-S-phase checkpoint. This phenotype reflected unanticipated regulation of global replication by IGF1 mediated via AKT, MEK/ERK, and JUN to influence expression of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) subunit RRM2. Consequently, inhibition or depletion of IGF1R downregulated RRM2, compromising RNR function and perturbing dNTP supply. The resulting delay in fork progression and hallmarks of replication stress were rescued by RRM2 overexpression, confirming RRM2 as the critical factor through which IGF1 regulates replication. Suspecting existence of a backup pathway protecting from toxic sequelae of replication stress, targeted compound screens in breast cancer cells identified synergy between IGF inhibition and ATM loss. Reciprocal screens of ATM-proficient/deficient fibroblasts identified an IGF1R inhibitor as the top hit. IGF inhibition selectively compromised growth of ATM-null cells and spheroids and caused regression of ATM-null xenografts. This synthetic-lethal effect reflected conversion of single-stranded lesions in IGF-inhibited cells into toxic DSBs upon ATM inhibition. Overall, these data implicate IGF1R in alleviating replication stress, and the reciprocal IGF:ATM codependence we identify provides an approach to exploit this effect in ATM-deficient cancers. SIGNIFICANCE: This study identifies regulation of ribonucleotide reductase function and dNTP supply by IGFs and demonstrates that IGF axis blockade induces replication stress and reciprocal codependence on ATM.

Yet, accurate transcriptional profiling requires RNA of a high quality, which often cannot be retrieved from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue that is routinely collected and archived in clinical departments. To overcome this roadblock to clinical testing, we previously developed MethCORR, a method that infers gene expression from DNA methylation data, which is robustly retrieved from FFPE tissue. MethCORR was originally developed for colorectal cancer and with this study, we aim to: (1) extend the MethCORR method to 10 additional cancer types and (2) to illustrate that the inferred gene expression is accurate and clinically informative.  Results:   Regression models to infer gene expression information from DNA methylation were developed for ten common cancer types using matched RNA sequencing and DNA methylation profiles (HumanMethylation450 BeadChip) from The Cancer Genome Atlas Project. Robust and accurate gene expression profiles were inferred for all cancer types: on average, the expression of 11,000 genes was modeled with good accuracy and an intra-sample correlation of R2 = 0.90 between inferred and measured gene expression was observed. Molecular pathway analysis and transcriptional subtyping were performed for breast, prostate, and lung cancer samples to illustrate the general usability of the inferred gene expression profiles: overall, a high correlation of r = 0.96 (Pearson) in pathway enrichment scores and a 76% correspondence in molecular subtype calls were observed when using measured and inferred gene expression as input. Finally, inferred expression from FFPE tissue correlated better with RNA sequencing data from matched fresh-frozen tissue than did RNA sequencing data from FFPE tissue (P < 0.0001; Wilcoxon rank-sum test).  Conclusions:   In all cancers investigated, MethCORR enabled DNA methylation-based transcriptional analysis, thus enabling future analysis of cancer in situations where high-quality DNA, but not RNA, is available. Here, we provide the framework and resources for MethCORR modeling of ten common cancer types, thereby widely expanding the possibilities for transcriptional studies of archival FFPE material.""","""['Trine B Mattesen', 'Claus L Andersen#', 'Jesper B Bramsen#']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Clin Epigenetics""","""['MethCORR modelling of methylomes from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue enables characterization and prognostication of colorectal cancer.', 'Comparison of triple-negative breast cancer molecular subtyping using RNA from matched fresh-frozen versus formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue.', 'The impact of RNA extraction method on accurate RNA sequencing from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues.', 'Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip.', 'Unlocking the molecular archive: the emerging use of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue for biomarker research in urological cancer.']"""

Predicting the risk of PCa is pivotal for making an informed decision on treatment options as the 5-year survival rate in the low-risk group is more than 95% and most men would benefit from surveillance rather than active treatment. Three-dimensional genome architecture and chromosome structures undergo early changes during tumourigenesis both in tumour and in circulating cells and can serve as a disease biomarker.  Methods:   In this prospective study we screened whole blood of newly diagnosed, treatment naïve PCa patients (n = 140) and cancer-free controls (n = 96) for the presence of 14,241 chromosomal loops in the loci of 425 genes.  Results:   We have detected specific chromosome conformation changes in the loci of ETS1, MAP3K14, SLC22A3 and CASP2 genes in peripheral blood from PCa patients yielding PCa detection with 80% sensitivity and 80% specificity. Further analysis between PCa risk groups yielded prognostic validation sets consisting of HSD3B2, VEGFC, APAF1, BMP6, ERG, MSR1, MUC1, ACAT1 and DAPK1 genes that achieved 80% sensitivity and 93% specificity stratifying high-risk category 3 vs low risk category 1 and 84% sensitivity and 89% specificity stratifying high risk category 3 vs intermediate risk category 2 disease.

This technique is associated with post-operative urinary incontinence. Pelvic floor physiotherapy is a conservative, painless and economical treatment for this specific situation. Kegel exercises and perineal electrostimulation are common techniques to train pelvic floor muscles. The perineal electrostimulation can be applied to the patient with surface electrodes or by an intra-cavitary anal probe. This study proposes that transcutaneous perineal electrostimulation is as effective as intra-cavitary electrostimulation in reducing urinary incontinence secondary to radical prostatectomy. The main objective is to compare the efficacy of the treatment with transcutaneous perineal electrostimulation versus the same intra-cavitary treatment to reduce the magnitude of urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy, and the impact on the quality of life.  Methods:   This single-blind equivalence randomized controlled trial will include 70 man who suffer urinary incontinence post radical prostatectomy. Participants will be randomized into surface electrodes group and intra-anal probe group. The groups will receive treatment for 10 consecutive weeks. Outcomes include changes in the 24-h Pad Test, and ICIQ-SF, SF-12 and I-QoL questionnaires. Clinical data will be collected at baseline, 6 and 10 weeks after the first session, and 6 months after the end of treatment.

Methods:   We enrolled 163 patients on whom robot-assisted radical prostatectomy was carried out and whose urine loss rate we were able to evaluate after catheter removal. Urinary incontinence was evaluated from immediately after removal of the catheter to the date of discharge, and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery. Urine loss rate was defined as the urine loss volume divided by the total urine volume.  Results:   The continence rates of patients with ≤1% urine loss rate on the day of catheter removal were 100% at 6 and 12 months after surgery. A multivariate analysis proved that ≤10% urine loss rate on the day of catheter removal was a significant predictor of continence at 3 months after surgery. Furthermore, the continence rate at 12 months of patients who did not achieve ≤10% urine loss rate on the day of catheter removal was 79.5%. Among them, the continence rate at 12 months of patients who achieved ≥15% urine loss rate improvement from the day of catheter removal to the next day was 95.2%; the factor differed significantly between the continence and incontinence groups at 12 months after surgery.  Conclusions:   The urine loss rate on the day of catheter removal is significantly related to the acquisition of urinary continence.

However, scant studies have investigated the association of NLR, PLR, and LMR with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).  Methods:   Data from 8,727 middle-aged men who had participated in a health checkup were analyzed. BPH was defined as prostate volume ≥30 mL, International Prostate Symptom Score > 7, and maximal flow rate <15 mL/s. Propensity score matching was considered for 269 men with BPH (cases), and 7,136 men with no BPH (controls), but ultimately, propensity scores were matched at a 2:1 ratio of controls to cases (538 men in the control group and 269 men in the case group).  Results:   After propensity score matching, age, International Index of Erectile Function-5, testosterone, and number of metabolic syndrome component variables were evenly distributed and did not differ significantly between the groups. After matching, PLR and LMR were not significantly different between the 2 groups. However, NLR was significantly higher in the case group than in the control group (median [interquartile range]: 1.4 [1.1; 1.8] vs. 1.5 [1.2; 1.9]; p = 0.024) after matching.

Chaperonin Containing TCP1 Subunit 3 (CCT3) is one of eight subunits forming eukaryotic chaperons that catalyzes correct folding of the proteins employed in cell division, proliferation, and apoptosis pathway. Moreover, CCT3 expression increases responsively with carcinogenesis. However, how CCT3 drives the cancerous process has not been documented. Here we probed the mechanistic and functional interactions between CCT3 and apoptotic pathways and cell stressors. First, we profiled CCT3 expression levels of different 16 cell lines and found that CCT3 expression levels of CRL-2329 and PC3 were significantly increased. Then, we suppressed CCT3 levels in CRL-2329 and PC3 lines by miR-24-3p, miR-128-3p, and miR-149-5p mimics, and measured apoptotic response of the cell lines to the knockdown of CCT3 by acridine orange/ethidium bromide and Annexin V/PI staining, cell-cycle and mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) analyses, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) measurement and analysis of expression levels of the apoptotic genes. After having suppressed CCT3, the cell cycle was arrested in the G0/G1 phase, MMP was impaired, and the intracellular ROS level was increased. These signs of apoptotic flux were corroborated by morphological images, statistically enhanced expression levels of the apoptotic pathway modulators and intracellular free amino acids profile. The free amino acid profile, which is heavily implicated in energy metabolism and cell division, is fluctuated in the progress of canceration. Strikingly, suppressed CCT3 shifted intracellular levels of glutamine, beta-alanine, glycine, serin, asparagine and sarcosine, which are employed in energy metabolism. Consequently, miRNA-mediated CCT3 suppression spur apoptosis by unbalancing the homeostasis in intracellular ROS and the profile of free amino acids in energy metabolism. Taken together, we anticipate that miRNA-mediated CCT3 suppression might provide a ""dual therapeutic strategy"" through conventional cellular toxicity as well as energy withdrawal.""","""['Ebru Temiz', 'İsmail Koyuncu', 'Emel Sahin']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Free Radic Biol Med""","""['Current understanding on the role of CCT3 in cancer research.', 'Overexpression of chaperonin containing TCP1, subunit 3 predicts poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Circular RNA circ-CCT3 promotes bortezomib resistance in multiple myeloma via modulating miR-223-3p/BRD4 axis.', 'Upregulation of CCT3 promotes cervical cancer progression through FN1.', 'Chaperonin containing TCP1 subunit 3 (CCT3) promotes cisplatin resistance of lung adenocarcinoma cells through targeting the Janus kinase 2/signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) pathway.', 'CircRNA-miRNA-VEGFA: an important pathway to regulate cancer pathogenesis.', 'Integrated analyzes identify CCT3 as a modulator to shape immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Insights into the roles and driving forces of CCT3 in human tumors.', 'A vicious circle in breast cancer: The interplay between inflammation, reactive oxygen species, and microRNAs.', 'Current understanding on the role of CCT3 in cancer research.']"""

Recent studies indicate that BTVs are capable of infecting and selectively lysing human hepatic carcinoma cells (Hep-3B) and prostate carcinoma cells (pc-3). This study was designed to evaluate the oncolytic potential of BTV in experimental models of human renal cancer in vitro and in vivo. MATERIAL AND METHODS Five human renal cancer cell lines, ACHN, CAKI-1, OS-RC-2, 786-O, and A498, were used in this study to analyze BTV replication. These cells were lysed by oncolysis compared to normal control. Xenograft models were used to assess the efficacy and toxicity of BTVs in vivo. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA or two-sided unpaired t tests. RESULTS The results showed HPTEC cells to be relatively resistant to cytotoxic effects of BTVs and exhibited normal growth rate even at high dose of BTVs. Nonetheless, the renal cancer cells showed a remarkably higher sensitivity to BTVs. Moreover, the ultramicroscopic subcellular changes were also detected in the renal cells. The viral particles were observed in all the RCC cell lines, but not in HPTEC cells. Intratumoral injections of BTVs significantly decreased the tumor volume as compared to animals that received no virus treatment. Infection with BTVs significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic renal cancer cells but not the HPTEC cells. Moreover, BTV triggered apoptosis in renal cancer cells via a mitochondria-mediated pathway.

Four observers (two radiation oncologists, two radiologists) manually delineated the DIL on: (1) bpMRI (GTVMRI), (2) PSMA-PET (GTVPSMA) and (3) co-registered bpMRI/PSMA-PET (GTVFused) in separate sittings. Interobserver, intermodality and semi-automated comparisons were evaluated against consensus Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation (STAPLE) volumes, created from the relevant manual delineations of all observers with equal weighting. Comparisons included the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), mean distance to agreement (MDA) and other metrics.  Results:   Interobserver agreement was significantly higher (p < 0.05) for GTVPSMA (DSC: 0.822, MDA: 1.12 mm) and GTVFused (DSC: 0.787, MDA: 1.34 mm) than for GTVMRI (DSC: 0.705, MDA 2.44 mm). Intermodality agreement between GTVMRI and GTVPSMA was low (DSC: 0.440, MDA: 4.64 mm). Agreement between semi-automated volumes and consensus GTV was low for MRI (DSC: 0.370, MDA: 8.16 mm) and significantly higher for PSMA-PET (0.571, MDA: 4.45 mm, p < 0.05).  Conclusion: 68Ga-PSMA-PET appears to improve interobserver consistency of DIL localisation vs bpMRI and may be more viable for simple quantitative delineation approaches; however, more sophisticated approaches to semi-automatic delineation factoring for patient- and disease-related heterogeneity are likely required.  Advances in knowledge:   This is the first study to evaluate the interobserver variability of prostate GTV delineations with co-registered bpMRI and 68Ga-PSMA-PET.""","""['Nathan Hearn', 'John Blazak', 'Philip Vivian', 'Dinesh Vignarajah', 'Katelyn Cahill', 'Daisy Atwell', 'Jim Lagopoulos', 'Myo Min']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Br J Radiol""","""['68Ga-PSMA-11 PET, 18F-PSMA-1007 PET, and MRI for Gross Tumor Volume Delineation in Primary Prostate Cancer: Intermodality and Intertracer Variability.', 'Manual and semi-automated delineation of locally advanced rectal cancer subvolumes with diffusion-weighted MRI.', 'MRI versus ⁶⁸Ga-PSMA PET/CT for gross tumour volume delineation in radiation treatment planning of primary prostate cancer.', '68Ga-prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) for primary staging of high-risk prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'PET-CT and PET-MRI of the prostate : From 18F-FDG to 68Ga-PSMA.', 'A Systematic Review of the Variability in Performing and Reporting Intraprostatic Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography in Primary Staging Studies.', 'Evaluation of therapeutic radiographer contouring for magnetic resonance image guided online adaptive prostate radiotherapy.', 'Feasibility of biology-guided radiotherapy using PSMA-PET to boost to dominant intraprostatic tumour.', 'Reduction of inter-observer differences in the delineation of the target in spinal metastases SBRT using an automatic contouring dedicated system.']"""

Methods:   Blood samples were collected from 65 female BC, 116 CRC, 79 PCa and 88 myocardial infarction (MI) patients, and 110 healthy individuals to determine the concentration of tumor and cardiac markers. Furthermore, the IL-18 rs1946518 polymorphism was assessed using amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS)-PCR.  Results:   The serum levels of the tumor markers cancer antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and total prostate-specific antigen (TPSA) were significantly increased in cancer patients compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, the activity of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) and creatine kinase‑myocardial band (CK-MB) was enhanced in MI patients, however, their activity was unchanged in cancer patients. The activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and the serum concentration of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and urea were markedly elevated in CRC and PCa patients, respectively, compared with the control group. Although, no significant differences were observed in the -607 C/A polymorphism and allele frequency of IL-18 among BC, CRC patients and healthy individuals, the odds ratio (OR) was 1.75 for both C and A allele in BC patients. Therefore, the -607 C/A polymorphism could be considered as a risk factor for BC.  Conclusion:   The aforementioned results suggested that tumor markers could be considered as excellent biomarkers for the early detection of BC, CRC and PCa, whereas the concentration of liver enzymes could serve as an alternative indicator for the diagnosis of CRC and PCa. Additionally, the rs1946518 polymorphism in the IL-18 gene could be considered as a risk factor for the occurrence of BC, CRC and PCa.<br />.""","""['Govand Qader', 'Mukhlis Aali', 'Shukur W Smail', 'Kazhan Mahmood', 'Bestoon Hasan', 'Karwan M-Amen', 'Dlzar Bayz Rahman', 'Fikry A Qadir', 'Dara K Mohammad', 'Hastyar H Najmuldeen', 'Fryad Majeed Rahman', 'Seepal Ibrahim Ahmad', 'Nergz S Salih', 'Zainab M Khdhr', 'Bushra A Mohammed', 'Asuda M Majeed', 'Xanda M Hasan', 'Bushra H Khidhir', 'Eman S Muhammad', 'Bahar A Muhamadsalih', 'Simav K Hasan', 'Aram J Hamad', 'Zahra K Esmail', 'Chra M Ismael', 'Shan M Husaen', 'Chiavan A Abdulla', 'Bashdar M Hussen', 'Zjwan Housein', 'Mudhir Shekha', 'Abbas Salihi']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Association of rs1946518 C/A Polymorphism in Promoter Region of Interleukin 18 Gene and Breast Cancer Risk in Iranian Women: A Case-control Study.', 'Association of -607 C/A polymorphism of IL-18 gene (rs1946518) with breast cancer risk in Zahedan, Southeast Iran.', 'Association of the IL-10 gene rs1800872 (-592 C>A) polymorphism with breast cancer in a Mexican population.', 'Old and New Blood Markers in Human Colorectal Cancer.', 'Rational, Design and Preliminary Results of a Cohort Study on Breast and Colorectal Cancer to Develop a Risk Assessment Model to Predict Future Cardiovascular Events.

Patients and methods:   We identified consecutive intermediate and high-risk localized PCa patients treated with definitive radiotherapy using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with variable duration of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) within 2015-2016 (Arm-A) and 2005-2007 (Arm-B). Arm-A cases received daily online imaging guidance (IGRT) using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) unlike Arm-B candidates with no daily IGRT. After reporting demographic, clinico-pathological features and treatment details, we compared acute (within 3 months post-therapy) and late RT-induced toxicities between study groups graded by RTOG/CTCAE criteria. Uni/multivariate analyses (UVA/MVA) were performed to identify independent predictors for RT-related side-effects.  Results:   We were able to identify 257 cases who met our inclusion criteria. Overall, median age was 73 years (48-85), 67% had intermediate-risk and 47% received ADT. Arm-A included 72 patients who received IMRT delivered using volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT), whereas, Arm-B was formed of 185 cases who utilized step-and-shoot static IMRT. Clinico-pathological features and treatment details were non-different across study arms except that Arm-A had more Grade Group 3, higher median total dose (79.2 vs. 74 Gy) and more pelvic lymph-nodes RT (p <0.05). Although acute toxicity was similar across groups, Arm-B encountered higher late toxicity score, more intense late genitourinary side-effects (P=0.008), with non-different late lower-gastrointestinal toxicities. On MVA, lack of daily CBCT, African-American race and higher comorbidities were independently predictive for late toxicities. Conclusion: IMRT with daily CBCT permitted safe delivery of dose-escalated IMRT with improved toxicity profile for higher-risk prostate cancer.""","""['Ahmad I Ghanem', 'Amr A Elsaid', 'Mohamed A Elshaikh', 'Gehan A Khedr']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Decreased acute toxicities of intensity-modulated radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer with prostate-based versus bone-based image guidance.', 'A Dosimetric Comparison between Conventional Fractionated and Hypofractionated Image-guided Radiation Therapies for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Moderate Hypofractionation with Simultaneous Integrated Boost in Prostate Cancer: Long-term Results of a Phase I-II Study.', 'Current status of intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: History, clinical results and future directions.', 'Late toxicity rates following definitive radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Using a Further Planning MRI after Neoadjuvant Androgen Deprivation Therapy Significantly Reduces the Radiation Exposure of Organs at Risk in External Beam Radiotherapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Cone-beam CT delta-radiomics to predict genitourinary toxicities and international prostate symptom of prostate cancer patients: a pilot study.', 'The role of image-guided radiotherapy in prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

To eliminate detection bias in a screened cohort, we propose modeling the latent onset of cancer and estimating the association between risk factors and onset rather than diagnosis. We apply this framework to estimate the increase in prostate cancer risk associated with black race and family history using data from the SELECT prostate cancer prevention trial, in which men were screened and biopsied according to community practices. A positive family history was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of prostate cancer onset of 1.8, lower than the corresponding HR of prostate cancer diagnosis (HR = 2.2). This result comports with a finding that men in SELECT with a family history were more likely to be biopsied following a positive PSA test than men with no family history. For black race, the HRs for onset and diagnosis were similar, consistent with similar patterns of screening and biopsy by race. If individual screening and diagnosis histories are available, latent disease modeling can be used to decouple risk of disease from risk of disease diagnosis and reduce detection bias.""","""['Serge Aleshin-Guendel', 'Jane Lange', 'Phyllis Goodman', 'Noel S Weiss', 'Ruth Etzioni']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eval Health Prof""","""['Screening Men at Increased Risk for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: Model Estimates of Benefits and Harms.', 'Association between family history of prostate cancer and positive biopsies in a Brazilian screening program.', 'Histological inflammation and risk of subsequent prostate cancer among men with initially elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration in the Finnish prostate cancer screening trial.', 'Biases in Recommendations for and Acceptance of Prostate Biopsy Significantly Affect Assessment of Prostate Cancer Risk Factors: Results From Two Large Randomized Clinical Trials.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force.']"""

The aim of this survey was to evaluate recent patterns of care of German-speaking radiation oncologists for RT of PC.  Methods:   We developed an online survey which we distributed via e‑mail to all registered members of the German Society of Radiation Oncology (DEGRO). The survey was completed by 109 participants between March 3 and April 3, 2020. For evaluation of radiation dose, we used the equivalent dose at fractionation of 2 Gy with α/β = 1.5 Gy, equivalent dose (EQD2 [1.5 Gy]).  Results:   Median EQD2(1.5 Gy) for definitive RT of the prostate is 77.60 Gy (range: 64.49-84.00) with median single doses (SD) of 2.00 Gy (range: 1.80-3.00), while for postoperative RT of the prostate bed, median EQD2(1.5 Gy) is 66.00 Gy (range: 60.00-74.00) with median SD of 2.00 Gy (range: 1.80-2.00). For definitive RT, the pelvic lymph nodes (LNs) are treated in case of suspect findings in imaging (82.6%) and/or according to risk formulas/tables (78.0%). In the postoperative setting, 78.9% use imaging and 78.0% use the postoperative tumor stage for LN irradiation. In the definitive and postoperative situation, LNs are irradiated with a median EQD2(1.5 Gy) of 47.52 Gy with a range of 42.43-66.00 and 41.76-62.79, respectively.  Conclusion:   German-speaking radiation oncologists' patterns of care for patients with PC are mainly in line with the published data and treatment recommendation guidelines.

Material and Methods. In this secondary data analysis, a total of 6,403 men aged ≥40 years and without malignant tumor history were included from 2003 to 2010. The independent variable of this study was the total dietary intake of sugars, and the dependent variable was serum PSA concentrations. Covariates included dietary, comorbidity, physical examination, and demographic data.  Results:   The average age of participants included in this study was 58.1 years (±13.6). After adjusting for the dietary, comorbidity, physical examination, and demographic data, we observed that a dietary intake increase of one gram of total dietary intake of sugars was associated with an increase of serum PSA concentrations by 0.003 ng/mL (after log2 transformed, 95% CI: 0.001 to 0.005) with a P value for trend less than 0.05. Sensitivity analysis using the generalized additive model (GAM) supported the linear association between total dietary intake of sugars and serum PSA concentrations.  Conclusion:   The total dietary intake of sugars is independently and positively associated with serum PSA concentrations in adult American males who are without a personal history of malignant tumors.""","""['Zhangcheng Liu', 'Chi Chen', 'Fuxun Yu', 'Dongbo Yuan', 'Wei Wang', 'Ke Jiao', 'Shengbang Yang', 'Yongqiang Zhang', 'Yong Wang', 'Linhai Liu', 'Huali Xu', 'Yang Zhang', 'Guohua Zhu', 'Bin Hu', 'Jianguo Zhu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Biomed Res Int""","""['The relationship between serum albumin and prostate-specific antigen: A analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2003-2010.', 'Is there a non-linear relationship between dietary protein intake and prostate-specific antigen: proof from the national health and nutrition examination survey (2003-2010).', 'Dietary phosphorus intake and serum prostate-specific antigen in non-prostate cancer American adults: A secondary analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2003-2010.', 'Association between Serum Triglycerides and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) among U.S. Males: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2003-2010.', 'Effect of physical activity and sedentary behavior on serum prostate-specific antigen concentrations: results from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2003-2006.', 'Association of TyG index with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in American men: results from NHANES, 2003-2010.', 'The relationship between serum albumin and prostate-specific antigen: A analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2003-2010.', 'Assessing volatile organic compounds exposure and prostate-specific antigen: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2001-2010.']"""

Patients with primary liver cancer experienced poor prognosis and high mortality, so early detection of liver cancer and improved management of metastases are both key strategies to reduce the death toll from liver cancer. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression in the tumor-associated neovasculature of nonprostate malignancies including liver cancer has been reported recently, but conclusive evidence of PSMA expression based on the pathological type of liver cancer remains limited.  Aim:   To study the expression of PSMA in HCC, CCA, and liver cirrhosis.  Methods:   A total of 446 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) liver tumor and liver cirrhosis tissue samples were obtained retrospectively from the Pathology Department of Tongji Hospital. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect PSMA expression in these 446 FFPE liver biopsy specimens (213 HCC, 203 CCA, and 30 liver cirrhosis). The tumor compartment and the associated neovascular endothelium were separately analyzed. PSMA expression was examined by two certified pathologists, and the final results were presented in a 4-point scoring system (0-3 points). Correlation between PSMA expression and clinicopathological information was also assessed.  Results:   PSMA was expressed primarily in the neovascular endothelium associated with tumors. The positive rate of PSMA staining in HCC was significantly higher than that in CCA (86.8% vs 79.3%; P = 0.001) but was only 6.6% in liver cirrhosis (P = 0.000). HCC cases had more 3-score PSMA staining than CCA had (89/213, 41.8% vs 35/203, 17.2%; P = 0.001). PSMA expression correlated positively with the stage and grade of HCC and CCA. In both liver cancer subtypes, there were more PSMA+ cases in stages III-V diseases than in stages I and II. High staining intensity of PSMA was more frequently observed in liver cancers at high grade and advanced stage. There was no significant association of PSMA expression with sex, age, region, α-fetoprotein, hepatitis B surface antigen, or tumor size in both tumor subtypes.  Conclusion:   Neovascular PSMA may be a promising marker to differentiate HCC from liver cirrhosis and a prognostic marker for anti-tumor angiogenesis therapy for HCC.""","""['Li-Xing Chen', 'Si-Juan Zou', 'Dan Li', 'Jian-Yuan Zhou', 'Zhao-Ting Cheng', 'Jun Zhao', 'Yuan-Li Zhu', 'Dong Kuang', 'Xiao-Hua Zhu']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""World J Gastroenterol""","""['PSMA as a Theranostic Target in Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Immunohistochemistry and 68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET Using Cyclotron-Produced 68 Ga.', 'Combined hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma: clinical features and prognostic study in a Thai population.', 'A comparative study of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma with reference to clinical features and prognosis.', 'Hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma: an update.', 'Synchronous double cancers of primary hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: a case report and review of the literature.', 'Cuproptosis-Related Genes CDK1 and COA6 Involved in the Prognosis Prediction of Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Comparison between PSMA PET/CT and MRI for Characterizing Hepatocellular carcinoma: A Real-World Study.', 'Can PSMA-Targeting Radiopharmaceuticals Be Useful for Detecting Hepatocellular Carcinoma Using Positron Emission Tomography?

We compared oncological outcomes of FT to radical prostatectomy (RP).  Methods:   Using prospective multicentre databases of 761 FT and 572 RP cases (November/2005-September/2018), patients with PSA < 20 ng/ml, Gleason </= 4 + 3 and stage </= T2c were 1-1 propensity score-matched for treatment year, age, PSA, Gleason, T-stage, cancer core length and use of neoadjuvant hormones. FT included 1-2 sessions. Primary outcome was failure-free survival (FFS) defined by need for salvage local or systemic therapy or metastases. Differences in FFS were determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis with log-rank test.  Results:   335 radical prostatectomy and 501 focal therapy patients were eligible for matching. For focal therapy, 420 had HIFU and 81 cryotherapy. Cryotherapy was used predominantly for anterior cancer. After matching, 246 RP and 246 FT cases were identified. For radical prostatectomy, mean (SD) age was 63.4 (5.6) years, median (IQR) PSA 7.9 g/ml (6-10) and median (IQR) follow-up 64 (30-89) months. For focal therapy, these were 63.3 (6.9) years, 7.9 ng/ml (5.5-10.6) and 49 [34-67] months, respectively.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a compelling target for mCRPC. It is highly expressed by primary and metastatic prostate cancer cells, with increased expression after progression on androgen deprivation therapy.  Experimental design:   We developed AMG 160, a half-life extended, bispecific T-cell engager immuno-oncology therapy that binds PSMA on prostate cancer cells and cluster of differentiation 3 on T cells for treatment of mCRPC. AMG 160 was evaluated in vitro and in mCRPC xenograft models. AMG 160 tolerability was assessed in nonhuman primates (NHP). AMG 160 activity as monotherapy and in combination with a PSMA-imaging agent, novel hormonal therapy, and immune checkpoint blockade was evaluated.  Results:   AMG 160 induces potent, specific killing of PSMA-expressing prostate cancer cell lines in vitro, with half-maximal lysis of 6-42 pmol/L. In vivo, AMG 160 administered weekly at 0.2 mg/kg engages T cells administered systemically and promotes regression of established 22Rv-1 mCRPC xenograft tumors. AMG 160 is compatible with the imaging agent gallium 68-labeled PSMA-11, and shows enhanced cytotoxic activity when combined with enzalutamide or an anti-programmed death-1 antibody. AMG 160 exhibits an extended half-life and has an acceptable safety profile in NHPs.  Conclusions:   The preclinical characterization of AMG 160 highlights its potent antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo, and its potential for use with known diagnostic or therapeutic agents in mCRPC. These data support the ongoing clinical evaluation of AMG 160 in patients with mCRPC.See related commentary by Kamat et al., p. 2675.""","""['Petra Deegen', 'Oliver Thomas', 'Olivier Nolan-Stevaux', 'Shyun Li', 'Joachim Wahl', 'Pamela Bogner', 'Famke Aeffner', 'Matthias Friedrich', 'Michael Z Liao', 'Katja Matthes', 'Doris Rau', 'Benno Rattel', 'Tobias Raum', 'Peter Kufer', 'Angela Coxon', 'Julie M Bailis']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['BiTE-ing into Prostate Cancer with Bispecific T-cell Engagers.', 'MOR209/ES414, a Novel Bispecific Antibody Targeting PSMA for the Treatment of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Attenuating CD3 affinity in a PSMAxCD3 bispecific antibody enables killing of prostate tumor cells with reduced cytokine release.', 'Regression of human prostate cancer xenografts in mice by AMG 212/BAY2010112, a novel PSMA/CD3-Bispecific BiTE antibody cross-reactive with non-human primate antigens.', 'Efficacy Against Human Prostate Cancer by Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-specific, Transforming Growth Factor-β Insensitive Genetically Targeted CD8+ T-cells Derived from Patients with Metastatic Castrate-resistant Disease.', 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Directed Therapy for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Immunogenomic profiles associated with response to life-prolonging agents in prostate cancer.', 'Emerging therapies targeting the delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3) in small cell lung cancer.', 'The Molecular Biology of Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: From the Past to the Future.', 'Phase 1 Study of Safety and Preliminary Clinical Activity of JNJ-63898081, a PSMA and CD3 Bispecific Antibody, for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Progression in immunotherapy for advanced prostate cancer.']"""

However, the number of serious limitations of the microtubule targeting agents (MTAs) including poor bioavailability, adverse effects (e.g., systemic and neural toxicity), and acquired resistance after initiation of MTA-based therapy remain the driving forces to develop the novel therapeutic agents effectively targeting microtubules and exhibiting potent anti-tumor activities. Here, we report the discovery of 2-amino-pyrrole-carboxamides (2-APCAs), a novel class of MTA, which effectively inhibited the growth of the broad spectrum of cancer cell lines in vitro, including various types of breast, prostate, and non-small lung cancer (NSLC), soft tissue sarcomas (STS) (e.g., leio-, rhabdomyo-, and fibrosarcomas), osteosarcomas and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Importantly, 2-APCAs were also effective in cancer cell lines exhibiting resistance to certain chemotherapeutic agents, including MTAs and topoisomerase II inhibitors. The anti-proliferative effect of 2-APCAs was due to their ability to interfere with the polymerization of tubulin and thereby leading to the accumulation of tumor cells in the M-phase. As an outcome of the mitotic arrest, cancer cells underwent apoptotic cell death which was evidenced by increased expression of cleaved forms of the poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and caspase-3 and the increased numbers of Annexin V-positive cells, as well. Among the compounds exhibiting the potent anti-cancer activities against the various cancer cell lines indicated above, 2-APCA-III was found the most active. Importantly, its cytotoxic activities correlated with its highest potency to interfere with the dynamics of tubulin polymerization and inducement of cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. Interestingly, the cytotoxic and tubulin polymerization activities of 2-APCAs correlated with the stability of the «tubulin-2-АРСА» complexes, illustrating the ""tubulin-2-APCA-III"" complex as the most stable. Molecular docking showed that the binding site for 2-АРСА-III is located in α tubulin by forming a hydrogen bond with Leu23. Of note, single-cell electrophoresis (Comet assay) data illustrated the low genotoxic activities of 2-APCAs when compared to certain anti-cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Taken together, our study describes the novel MTAs with potent anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activities, thereby illustrating them as a scaffold for the development of successful chemotherapeutic anti-cancer agent targeting microtubules.""","""['Sergei Boichuk', 'Aigul Galembikova', 'Firuza Bikinieva', 'Pavel Dunaev', 'Aida Aukhadieva', 'Kirill Syuzov', 'Svetlana Zykova', 'Nazim Igidov', 'Alexander Ksenofontov', 'Pavel Bocharov']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Molecules""","""['CKT0353, a novel microtubule targeting agent, overcomes paclitaxel induced resistance in cancer cells.', 'The Design, Synthesis, and Biological Activities of Pyrrole-Based Carboxamides: The Novel Tubulin Inhibitors Targeting the Colchicine-Binding Site.', 'Arsenic trioxide produces polymerization of microtubules and mitotic arrest before apoptosis in human tumor cell lines.', 'Regulating the BCL2 Family to Improve Sensitivity to Microtubule Targeting Agents.', 'A new perspective on old drugs: non-mitotic actions of tubulin-binding drugs play a major role in cancer treatment.', 'Combretastatins D series and analogues: from isolation, synthetic challenges and biological activities.']"""

Recent studies of rapid actions mediated by estrogen in the prostate and its relationship with CRPC are emerging. We have previously shown that estrogen receptor (ER) promotes migration and invasion of the androgen-independent prostate cancer cells PC-3, but the signaling pathways involved in these events remain to be elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the role of ERα and ERβ in the activation of SRC, and the involvement of SRC and PI3K/AKT on invasion and colony formation of the PC-3 cells. Our results showed that the activation of ERα (using ERα-selective agonist PPT) and ERβ (using ERβ-selective agonist DPN) increased phosphorylation of SRC in PC-3 cells. In the presence of the selective inhibitor for SRC-family kinases PP2, the effects of DPN and PPT on transmigration and soft agar colony formation assays were decreased. Furthermore, SRC is involved in the expression of the non-phosphorylated β-catenin. Finally, using PI3K specific inhibitor Wortmannin and AKT inhibitor MK2206, we showed that PI3K/AKT are also required for invasion and colony formation of PC-3 cells simulated by ER. This study provides novel insights into molecular mechanisms of ER in PC-3 cells by demonstrating that ER, located outside the cell nucleus, activates rapid responses molecules, including SRC and PI3K/AKT, which enhance the tumorigenic potential of prostate cancer cells, increasing cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumor formation.""","""['Ana Paola G Lombardi', 'Renan P Cavalheiro', 'Catarina S Porto', 'Carolina M Vicente']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) mediates expression of β-catenin and proliferation in prostate cancer cell line PC-3.', 'Estrogen Receptors Promote Migration, Invasion and Colony Formation of the Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer Cells PC-3 Through β-Catenin Pathway.', 'Activation of estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) regulates the expression of N-cadherin, E-cadherin and β-catenin in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Estrogen receptor signaling in prostate cancer: Implications for carcinogenesis and tumor progression.', 'Comparison of the roles of estrogens and androgens in breast cancer and prostate cancer.', 'The Role of Estrogen Receptors in Health and Disease.', 'Diagnostic and Therapeutic Approaches for Glioblastoma and Neuroblastoma Cancers Using Chlorotoxin Nanoparticles.', 'Lifelong exercise training promotes the remodelling of the immune system and prostate signalome in a rat model of prostate carcinogenesis.', 'The Role of ERα and ERβ in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer and Current Therapeutic Approaches.', 'Estrogen receptors regulate galectin‑3 in androgen‑independent DU‑145 prostate cancer cells.']"""
