Although most cells express FASN at low levels, it is upregulated in cancers of the breast, prostate, and liver, among others, and is required during the replication of many viruses, such as dengue virus, hepatitis C, HIV-1, hepatitis B, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, among others. The precise role of FASN in disease pathogenesis is poorly understood, and whether de novo FA synthesis contributes to host or viral protein acylation has been traditionally difficult to study. Here, we describe a cell-permeable and click chemistry-compatible alkynyl acetate analog (alkynyl acetic acid or 5-hexynoic acid [Alk-4]) that functions as a reporter of FASN-dependent protein acylation. In an FASN-dependent manner, Alk-4 selectively labels the cellular protein interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 at its known palmitoylation sites, a process that is essential for the antiviral activity of the protein, and the HIV-1 matrix protein at its known myristoylation site, a process that is required for membrane targeting and particle assembly. Alk-4 metabolic labeling also enabled biotin-based purification and identification of more than 200 FASN-dependent acylated cellular proteins. Thus, Alk-4 is a useful bioorthogonal tool to selectively probe FASN-mediated protein acylation in normal and diseased states.""","""['Krithika P Karthigeyan', 'Lizhi Zhang', 'David R Loiselle', 'Timothy A J Haystead', 'Menakshi Bhat', 'Jacob S Yount', 'Jesse J Kwiek']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['FASN inhibitor TVB-3166 prevents S-acylation of the spike protein of human coronaviruses.', 'Cellular fatty acid synthase is required for late stages of HIV-1 replication.', 'Direct Inhibition of Cellular Fatty Acid Synthase Impairs Replication of Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Other Respiratory Viruses.', 'Progress in the development of fatty acid synthase inhibitors as anticancer targets.', 'Proteomic analysis of fatty-acylated proteins.']"""

Cancer cells are particularly reliant on this network; however, it is hypothesized that inhibition of one node might lead to compensation. To better understand these connections, we dosed 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells with inhibitors of four proteostasis targets (Hsp70, Hsp90, proteasome, and p97), either alone or in binary combinations, and measured the effects on cell growth. The results reveal a series of additive, synergistic, and antagonistic relationships, including strong synergy between inhibitors of p97 and the proteasome and striking antagonism between inhibitors of Hsp90 and the proteasome. Based on RNA-seq, these relationships are associated, in part, with activation of stress pathways. Together, these results suggest that cocktails of proteostasis inhibitors might be a powerful way of treating some cancers, although antagonism that blunts the efficacy of both molecules is also possible.""","""['Arielle Shkedi', 'Michael Adkisson', 'Andrew Schroeder', 'Walter L Eckalbar', 'Szu-Yu Kuo', 'Leonard Neckers', 'Jason E Gestwicki']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Med Chem""","""['Proteostasis by STUB1/HSP70 complex controls sensitivity to androgen receptor targeted therapy in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Combined inhibition of Hsp90 and the proteasome affects NSCLC proteostasis and attenuates cell migration.', 'Selective vulnerabilities in the proteostasis network of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Lessons Learned from Proteasome Inhibitors, the Paradigm for Targeting Protein Homeostasis in Cancer.', 'Inhibitors and chemical probes for molecular chaperone networks.']"""

However, only a few epidemiological studies have reported dairy products as being a risk factor for prostate cancer in Japan, reporting contradictory results. We therefore investigated the association between the intake of dairy products and the occurrence of prostate cancer through a large-scale cohort study. The Japan Collaborative Cohort study analyzed approximately 110,000 residents from various Japanese districts who participated in our questionnaire survey during 1988-1990. The subjects of the present study were 26,464 men (age range: 40-79 years) from 24 districts wherein cancer incidence was reported. Their clinical course was followed up until 2009. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox's proportional hazards model, adjusted for age, survey area, family history of prostate cancer, body mass index, and total energy intake. For diet, we calculated the HRs associated with intermediate and high consumption of dairy products and compared them with those associated with low consumption. There were 412 cases of prostate cancer in the survey population. As dairy products, milk, yogurt, cheese, and butter were evaluated. Among them, milk consumption was associated with a significant risk (HR = 1.37, p = 0.009) and a dose-dependent response (p for trend = 0.009) adjusted for age and family history of prostate cancer, stratified by area. Milk and yogurt consumption showed a significantly positive risk and a dose-response relationship adjusted for age, family history of prostate cancer, body mass index, and total energy intake, stratified by area. In summary, a high intake of dairy products such as milk increased the risk of developing prostate cancer in Japanese men.""","""['Kazuya Mikami', 'Kotaro Ozasa', 'Tsuneharu Miki', 'Yoshiyuki Watanabe', 'Mitsuru Mori', 'Tatsuhiko Kubo', 'Koji Suzuki', 'Kenji Wakai', 'Masahiro Nakao', 'Akiko Tamakoshi;JACC Study Group']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Milch macht Männer morbid.', 'Dairy products intake and cancer mortality risk: a meta-analysis of 11 population-based cohort studies.', 'Dairy product, saturated fatty acid, and calcium intake and prostate cancer in a prospective cohort of Japanese men.', 'The association between dairy products consumption and prostate cancer risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Association of dairy intake with all-cause, cancer, and cardiovascular disease mortality in Japanese adults: a 25-year population-based cohort.', 'Dairy intake and the risk of pancreatic cancer: the Japan Collaborative Cohort Study (JACC Study) and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.', ""Role of Olaparib in the Management of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Japanese Clinician's Perspective."", 'Six Applications of Plant Based Diets for Health Promotion.']"""

Due to organ deformation and motion, the organ shapes seen at the pCT will not be identical to their shapes during RT. Any difference between the pCT organ shape and the organ's mean shape during RT will cause systematic errors. We propose to use statistical shrinkage estimation to reduce this error using only the pCT and the population mean shape computed from training data.  Methods:   The method was evaluated for the rectum in a cohort of 37 prostate cancer patients that had a pCT and 7-10 treatment CTs with rectum delineations. Deformable registration was performed both within-patient and between patients, resulting in point-to-point correspondence between all rectum shapes, which enabled us to compute a population mean rectum. Shrinkage estimates were found by combining the pCTs linearly with the population mean. The method was trained and evaluated using leave-one-out cross validation. The shrinkage estimates and the patient mean shapes were compared geometrically using the Dice similarity index (DSI), Hausdorff distance (HD), and bidirectional local distance. Clinical dose/volume histograms, equivalent uniform dose (EUD) and minimum dose to the hottest 5% volume (D5%) were compared for the shrinkage estimate and the pCT.  Results:   The method resulted in moderate but statistically significant increase in similarity to the patient mean shape over the pCT. On average, the HD was reduced from 15.6 to 13.4 mm, while the DSI was increased from 0.74 to 0.78. Significant reduction in the bias of volume estimates was found in the DVH-range of 52.5-65 Gy, where the bias was reduced from -1.3 to -0.2 percentage points, but no significant improvement was found in EUD or D5%, CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that shrinkage estimation can reduce systematic errors due to organ deformations in RT. The method has potential to increase the accuracy in RT of deformable organs and can improve motion modeling.""","""['Øyvind Lunde Rørtveit', 'Liv Bolstad Hysing', 'Andreas Størksen Stordal', 'Sara Pilskog']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Assessment and management of interfractional variations in daily diagnostic-quality-CT guided prostate-bed irradiation after prostatectomy.', 'Estimation of rectal dose using daily megavoltage cone-beam computed tomography and deformable image registration.', 'Deformable image registration for contour propagation from CT to cone-beam CT scans in radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Usefulness of hybrid deformable image registration algorithms in prostate radiation therapy.', 'Statistical simulations to estimate motion-inclusive dose-volume histograms for prediction of rectal morbidity following radiotherapy.']"""

However, the role of PTP1B in malignant melanoma (MM) is still unknown. PTP1B expression in normal and melanoma tissues was evaluated by GEO analysis and immunohistochemistry. The effects of PTP1B on cell migration and invasion were evaluated in melanoma cells with up - and downregulated PTP1B expression. In this study, we initially demonstrated that the expression of PTP1B in malignant melanoma tissue is significantly higher than its expression in benign nevus tissue and indicated poor survival of malignant melanoma patients. In vitro studies have demonstrated that inhibition of PTP1B suppresses and overexpression of PTP1B promotes migration and invasion of melanoma cells. Moreover, we found that PTP1B could interact with Src via coimmunoprecipitation and dephosphorylation of the Src at Tyr530 site. Collectively, our study revealed that PTP1B can promote melanoma cell metastasis by interacting with Src and provides a theoretical basis for future applications of PTP1B inhibitors in the treatment of malignant melanoma.""","""['Qiang Wang', 'Yuyan Pan', 'Liping Zhao', 'Fazhi Qi', 'Jiaqi Liu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Bioengineered""","""['PTP1B promotes cell proliferation and metastasis through activating src and ERK1/2 in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Frequent amplification of PTP1B is associated with poor survival of gastric cancer patients.', 'PTP1B contributes to calreticulin-induced metastatic phenotypes in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Inhibitors of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase PTP1B With Anticancer Potential.', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B): Insights into its New Implications in Tumorigenesis.', 'TRIP13/FLNA Complex Promotes Tumor Progression and Is Associated with Unfavorable Outcomes in Melanoma.', 'Critical roles of PTPN family members regulated by non-coding RNAs in tumorigenesis and immunotherapy.', ""Translocator protein (18 kDa) regulates the microglial phenotype in Parkinson's disease through P47."", 'Targeting Breast Cancer and Their Stem Cell Population through AMPK Activation: Novel Insights.', 'Recent advances in PTP1B signaling in metabolism and cancer.']"""

Methods:   For this secondary analysis, we reviewed all completed SWOG clinical trials to identify those for patients with advanced cancer that incorporated Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) questionnaires at baseline. FACT-Trial Outcome Index (FACT-TOI) was the primary independent variable. Associations between FACT-TOI and other FACT subscores with PFS and overall survival were evaluated via log-rank test and multivariable Cox regression analysis.  Results:   Three clinical trials met our inclusion criteria: S0027 and S9509 for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer and S0421 for hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Of the 1,527 enrolled patients, 1,295 (85%) had both HRQOL and survival outcomes data available and were included in this analysis. In univariable analysis, we observed a statistically significant gradient effect in all three trials, with higher baseline FACT-TOI scores corresponding to better PFS (S0027, P < .001; S9509, P = .02; and S0421, P < .001). In multivariable analysis, FACT-TOI was significantly associated with PFS in S0027 (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.42 to 1.00) but not in S9509 (HR = 0.77; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.05) or S042 (HR = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.01).

Results:   The median bladder filling volume was 102.8 cm3 (range: 31.7-774.0), and the median intra-patient bladder filling volume variation was 23.4 cm3 (range: 0.4-277.7). Univariate analysis revealed that the intra-patient variation was significantly larger in patients with an eGFR higher than the median (p = 0.003). No other factor showed correlations with the variation. As the larger bladder filling volume of the 2 consecutive days in patients increased (median 121.5 cm3 , range: 47.8-774.0), the intra-patient variation also increased.  Conclusion:   Patients with a higher eGFR show greater variation in bladder filling volume, and caution should be exercised when applying RT in these patients.""","""['Naoya Ishibashi', 'Toshiya Maebayashi', 'Masakuni Sakaguchi', 'Takuya Aizawa', 'Masahiro Okada']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Asia Pac J Clin Oncol""","""['Variation in volumes, dose-volume histograms, and estimated normal tissue complication probabilities of rectum and bladder during conformal radiotherapy of T3 prostate cancer.', 'Use of a prospective cohort study in the development of a bladder scanning protocol to assist in bladder filling consistency for prostate cancer patients receiving radiation therapy.', 'Strict bladder filling and rectal emptying during prostate SBRT: Does it make a dosimetric or clinical difference?', 'Bladder filling variation during radiation treatment of prostate cancer: can the use of a bladder ultrasound scanner and biofeedback optimize bladder filling?', 'Emptying the rectum before treatment delivery limits the variations of rectal dose - volume parameters during 3DCRT of prostate cancer.', 'Prognosis Analysis and Perioperative Research of Elderly Patients with Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer under Computed Tomography Image of Three-Dimensional Reconstruction Algorithm.']"""

Plasma tumor DNA (ptDNA) is an independent predictor of outcome in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). We aimed to investigate the association between ptDNA and VTE in mCRPC. This prospective biomarker study included 180 mCRPC patients treated with abiraterone and enzalutamide from April 2013 to December 2018. We excluded patients with a previous VTE history and/or ongoing anticoagulation therapy. Targeted next-generation sequencing was performed to determine ptDNA fraction from pretreatment plasma samples. VTE risk based on survival analysis was performed using cumulative incidence function and estimating sub-distributional hazard ratio (SHR). At a median follow-up of 58 months (range 0.5-111.0), we observed 21 patients who experienced VTE with a cumulative incidence at 12 months of 17.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 10.3-23.9). Elevated ptDNA, visceral metastasis, prior chemotherapy and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were significantly associated with higher VTE incidence compared to patients with no thrombosis (12-month estimate, 18.6% vs 3.5%, P = .0003; 44.4% vs 14.8%, P = .015; 24.7% vs 4.5%, P = .006; and 30.0% vs 13.5%, P = .05, respectively). In the multivariate analysis including ptDNA level, visceral metastases, number of lesions and serum LDH, high ptDNA fraction was the only independent factor associated with the risk of thrombosis (HR 5.78, 95% CI 1.63-20.44, P = .006). These results first suggest that baseline ptDNA fraction in mCRPC patients treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide may be associated with increased VTE risk. These patients may be followed-up more closely for the VTE risk, and the need for a primary thromboprophylaxis should be taken into account in mCRPC with elevated ptDNA.""","""['Vincenza Conteduca', 'Emanuela Scarpi', 'Daniel Wetterskog', 'Nicole Brighi', 'Fabio Ferroni', 'Alice Rossi', 'Alessandro Romanel', 'Giorgia Gurioli', 'Sara Bleve', 'Caterina Gianni', 'Giuseppe Schepisi', 'Cristian Lolli', 'Pietro Cortesi', 'Federica Matteucci', 'Domenico Barone', 'Giovanni Paganelli', 'Francesca Demichelis', 'Himisha Beltran', 'Gerhardt Attard', 'Ugo De Giorgi']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Plasma tumour DNA as an early indicator of treatment response in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Combining liquid biopsy and functional imaging analysis in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer helps predict treatment outcome.', 'Plasma Androgen Receptor and Docetaxel for Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Revealing the prognostic landscape of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide: a meta-analysis.', 'What do we know about treatment sequencing of abiraterone, enzalutamide, and chemotherapy in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer?', 'A nomogram for predicting the risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with solid cancers.', 'Impact of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps on Thrombosis Formation: New Findings and Future Perspective.']"""

Although PER3 has been suggested as a risk factor for cancer development, there are few reports elucidating the relationship between PER3 and PCa. We investigated the association between PER3 polymorphisms (rs2640908 and VNTR) and susceptibility to PCa in the Japanese population.  Methods:   Eighty three patients with PCa and 122 controls participated in this study. We analyzed rs2640908 and VNTR polymorphisms by using PCR-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).  Results:   Compared to the C/C genotype with the rs2640908 polymorphism, the T/T (OR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.15-0.81, P = 0.02) and C/T + T/T (OR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.24-0.88, P = 0.02) genotypes had a significantly lower risk of PCa. TT (OR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.10-0.77, P = 0.02) and CT + TT (OR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.23-0.97, P = 0.04) also had significant protection against PCa in the smoker group. Significantly, we observed an association between smoking and rs2640908 polymorphism in this study. However, no association between the VNTR polymorphisms and PCa was detected.

NUF2 and GMNN genes are considered as loci of susceptibility to tumorigenesis in humans. Alterations in expression of these genes have been reported in various malignancies. The aim of our study was to test whether different NUF2 and GMNN expression levels are associated with PC incidence and hence, might be considered as new molecular tools for PC screening.  Methods:   Biopsy samples from 40 PC patients and 41 healthy Iranian men were used to determine the relative gene expression. After RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, samples were analyzed using TaqMan Quantitative Real time PCR. Patients' background information, included smoking habits and family histories of PC, were recorded. Stages and grades of their PC were classified by the TNM tumor, node, metastasis (TMN) staging system based on standard guidelines.  Results: NUF2 expression did not significantly differ between the groups, while GMNN expression was significantly greater in the PC specimens than in the controls.  Conclusion:   Regarding the significant role of GMNN in various tumor phenotypes, and its importance in PC progression, the alteration in GMNN expression in PC samples vs. controls indicate that the genetic profiling of this cancer might be considered to personalize therapy for each patient in the future.""","""['Shaghayegh Pezeshki', 'Payam Hashemi', 'Alireza Salimi', 'Sheida Ebrahimi', 'Mandana Javanzad', 'Amir Monfaredan']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Rep Biochem Mol Biol""","""['Downregulation of NUF2 inhibits tumor growth and induces apoptosis by regulating lncRNA AF339813.', 'Geminin a multi task protein involved in cancer pathophysiology and developmental process: A review.', 'Frequent amplification of CENPF, GMNN and CDK13 genes in hepatocellular carcinomas.', 'Integrative Multi-Omics Analysis of Identified NUF2 as a Candidate Oncogene Correlates With Poor Prognosis and Immune Infiltration in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Hereditary/familial versus sporadic prostate cancer: few indisputable genetic differences and many similar clinicopathological features.', 'Identification of Prostate Cancer Risk Genetics Biomarkers Based on Intergraded Bioinformatics Analysis.']"""

Yet, interactions between age, stress and PCa progression are underexplored. Therefore, we characterized the effects of age and isolation combined with restraint (2 h/day) for 14 days post-tumor inoculation on behavior, tumor growth and host defense in the immunocompetent, orthotopic RM-9 murine PCa model. All mice were tumor inoculated. Isolation/restraint increased sympathetic and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal cortical activation, based on elevated serum 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol/norepinephrine ratios and corticosterone levels, respectively. Elevated zero maze testing revealed age-related differences in naïve C57Bl/6 mice, and increased anxiety-like behavior in tumor-bearing mice. In open field testing, old stressed mice were less active throughout the 30-min test than young non-stressed and stressed, and old non-stressed mice, suggesting greater anxiety in old stressed mice. Old (18 month) mice demonstrated more depression-like behavior than young mice with tail suspension testing, without effects of isolation/restraint stress. Old mice developed larger tumors, despite similar tumor expression of tumor vascular endothelial growth factor or transforming growth factor-beta1 across age. Tumor chemokine/cytokine expression, commonly prognostic for poorer outcomes, were uniquely age- and stress-dependent, underscoring the need for PCa research in old animals. Macrophages predominated in RM-9 tumors. Macrophages, and CD4+ and CD4+FoxP3+ T-cell tumor infiltration were greater in young mice than in old mice. Stress increased macrophage infiltration in old mice. Conversely, stress reduced intratumoral CD4+ and CD4+FoxP3+ T-cell numbers in young mice. CD8+ T-cell infiltration was similar across treatment groups. Our findings support that age- and psychological stress interacts to affect PCa outcomes by interfering with neural-immune mechanisms and affecting behavioral responses.""","""['Denise L Bellinger', 'Melissa S Dulcich', 'Christine Molinaro', 'Peter Gifford', 'Dianne Lorton', 'Daila S Gridley', 'Richard E Hartman']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""['Differential effects of stress exposure via two types of restraint apparatuses on behavior and plasma corticosterone level in inbred male BALB/cAJcl mice.', 'The effects of a standardized Acanthopanax koreanum extract on stress-induced behavioral alterations in mice.', 'Tumour necrosis factor receptor deficiency alters anxiety-like behavioural and neuroendocrine stress responses of mice.', 'Acute and repeated stress differentially regulates behavioral, endocrine, neural parameters relevant to emotional and stress response in young and aged rats.', 'CD4+ T helper 17 cell response of aged mice promotes prostate cancer cell migration and invasion.', 'Psychological distress and eustress in cancer and cancer treatment: Advances and perspectives.', 'β-Glucan ameliorates anxiety-like behavior in mice chronically infected with the Toxoplasma gondii Wh6 strain.', 'The Roles of Tumor-Associated Macrophages in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   The morphology, physicochemical, and magnetic properties of the system were evaluated using dynamic light scattering (DLS), fluorescence spectroscopy, Mössbauer spectroscopy, magnetometry, and fluorescence spectroscopy. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), confocal microscopy and flow cytometry were used to study the interaction of our nanoparticulate system with N-cadherin expressed in prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3 and DU 145). A purpose-built cuvette was used in the cancer cell capture experiments.  Results:   The obtained nanoparticles were a spherical, stable colloid, and exhibited excellent magnetic properties. Biological experiments confirmed that the novel SPION/CCh/N-cad system interacts specifically with N-cadherin present on the cell surface. Preliminary studies on the magnetic capture of PC-3 cells using the obtained nanoparticles were successful.

In this study, we evaluate whether this heterogeneity might be related to differences in this relationship by tumour or by individual genetic susceptibility to PCa.  Methods:   We studied 1047 incident PCa cases and 1379 randomly selected controls, recruited in 7 Spanish provinces for the population-based MCC-Spain case-control. Tumour were classified by aggressiveness according to the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP), and we constructed a PCa polygenic risk score (PRS) as proxy for genetic susceptibility. The epidemiological questionnaire collected detailed self-reported data on T2DM diagnosis and treatment. The association between T2DM status and PCa was studied by fitting mixed logistic regression models, and, for its association by aggressiveness of PCa, with multinomial logistic regression models. To evaluate the possible modulator role of PRS in this relationship, we included the corresponding interaction term in the model, and repeated the analysis stratified by PRS tertiles.  Results:   Globally, our results showed an inverse association between T2DM and overall PCa limited to grade 1 tumours (ORISUP = 1: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.53-0.98), which could be compatible with a detection bias. However, PCa risk also varied with duration of diabetes treatment -inversely to metformin and positively with insulin-, without differences by aggressiveness. When we considered genetic susceptibility, T2DM was more strongly associated with lower PCa risk in those with lower PRS (ORtertile 1: 0.31; 95% CI: 0.11-0.87), independently of ISUP grade.

Image assessment of treatment failure, however, requires proper knowledge about typical procedure-related changes in prostate MRI, which is sparse, in particular for unilateral HIFU treatment and late follow up (beyond 6 months). The goal of this study was therefore to compile the type and frequency of such MRI findings in selected patients without recurrent cancer 12 months after prostate hemiablation.  Methods:   Data from a prospective multicenter trial on HIFU hemiablation were reviewed retrospectively. Trial patients have had a late follow-up by MRI (at around 12 months) and either MRI/transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) fusion or standard TRUS-guided biopsy. This work deliberately included patients with non-recurrent cancer in the treated prostate lobe in per-protocol biopsy leaving 30 men with initial International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Grade Group of 1 or 2. Six categories of potential HIFU-related MRI features were assessed by an expert committee and then evaluated by two readers in consensus: 1. shrinkage of the treated lobe, 2. residual prostate tissue, 3. fluid-filled cavity, 4. fibrosis, 5. hematoma residuals (in the prostate or seminal vesicles) and 6. contrast enhancement of the ablated area.  Results:   Shrinkage of the ablated lobe was seen in 93% of the cases with an average percent volume change of -37% (range: -70% to +108%). In the contralateral lobe, the volume remained practically the same (-2% on average, p = 0.804). In the ablated lobe, the frequency of fibrosis was 97%. Residual prostate tissue was seen in 93% of the cases. The frequency for fluid-filled cavities was 97%, with the wide majority (90%) contiguous with the urethra. Hematoma residuals in the prostate and in seminal vesicles were found in 47% and 10% of the patients, respectively. Contrast enhancement was both rim-like (50%) as well as diffuse (33%) within the ablated area.  Conclusion:   In our case series of HIFU hemiablation in the prostate, shrinkage, residual prostate tissue, fluid-filled cavities contiguous with the urethra and fibrosis were very common late MRI findings of the ablated lobe in non-recurrent patients.

The [Ru2(Ibp)4Cl] (Ibp, ibuprofenate anion from HIbp ibuprofen drug), free or encapsulated, shows anticancer activity against glioblastoma (in vitro, in vivo), and against human breast and prostate cancer cells. Herein we report the interaction of [Ru2(Ibp)4Cl] and of [Ru2(Ac)4(H2O)2]PF6 (Ac, acetate) with the 4-aminopyridine (4Apy) drug. The N-ligand was capable of cleaving the paddlewheel unit with oxidation of Ru2(II,III) to Ru2(III,III)O μ-oxo core in the ibuprofen complex while the acetate complex underwent axial substitution of water by 4Apy. Carefully designed synthetic and chromatographic methods succeeded in giving the novel [Ru2O(Ibp)2(4Apy)6]Cl2 metallodrug, the first diruthenium(III,III) μ-oxo having chloride as counterion. Characterization was performed by elemental analysis, mass spectrometry, thermogravimetric analysis, electronic absorption and vibrational spectroscopies, molar conductivity and cyclic voltammetry. Kinetic studies for the μ-oxo complex (in 50:50 v/v ethanol:water) suggested an aquation/complexation equilibrium in consecutive step reactions with the exchange of the two 4Apy trans to the μ-oxo bridge by water (aquation) and the back coordination of 4Apy in excess of the N-ligand (complexation).

Treatment-specific out-of-pocket costs for patients undergoing localized prostate cancer treatment have not, to date, been described and may influence patient's decision making.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective cohort study among commercially-insured patients in the United States with incident prostate cancer from 2013 to 2018. We captured out-of-pocket and total costs in the year following diagnosis and compared these between patients receiving radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy, and no local treatment using propensity-score weighting adjusting for patient demographics and pre-diagnosis health utilization costs.  Results:   Among 30,360 included men [median age 59 years, 83% Charlson score 0], 15,854 underwent surgery, 5,265 radiotherapy, and 9,241 no local therapy in the year following diagnosis. In the 6-months preceding diagnosis, median overall and out-of-pocket health care costs were $2022 (interquartile range $3778) and $466 (interquartile range $781), respectively. Following propensity-score weighting, out-of-pocket costs were significantly lower for patients who received no active treatment (adjusted cost $1746, 95% confidence interval [CI] $1704-1788), followed by those who underwent surgery ($2983, 95% CI $2832-3142, P < 0.001), and those who underwent radiation ($3139, 95% CI $2939-3353, P < 0.001) in the 6-months following diagnosis. Similar patterns were seen with out-of-pocket costs 6 to 12 months following index, with overall costs, and with costs attributable to inpatient, outpatient medical, and outpatient pharmacy services.

We aimed to investigate the combination treatment using apalutamide plus abiraterone acetate, each of which suppresses the androgen signalling axis in a different way, versus standard care in mCRPC.  Methods:   ACIS was a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 3 study done at 167 hospitals in 17 countries in the USA, Canada, Mexico, Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, Africa, and South America. We included chemotherapy-naive men (aged ≥18 years) with mCRPC who had not been previously treated with androgen biosynthesis signalling inhibitors and were receiving ongoing androgen deprivation therapy, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, and a Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form question 3 (ie, worst pain in the past 24 h) score of 3 or lower. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via a centralised interactive web response system with a permuted block randomisation scheme (block size 4) to oral apalutamide 240 mg once daily plus oral abiraterone acetate 1000 mg once daily and oral prednisone 5 mg twice daily (apalutamide plus abiraterone-prednisone group) or placebo plus abiraterone acetate and prednisone (abiraterone-prednisone group), in 28-day treatment cycles. Randomisation was stratified by presence or absence of visceral metastases, ECOG performance status, and geographical region. Patients, the investigators, study team, and the sponsor were masked to group assignments. An independent data-monitoring committee continually monitored data to ensure ongoing patient safety, and reviewed efficacy data. The primary endpoint was radiographic progression-free survival assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was reported for all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is completed and no longer recruiting and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02257736.  Findings:   982 men were enrolled and randomly assigned from Dec 10, 2014 to Aug 30, 2016 (492 to apalutamide plus abiraterone-prednisone; 490 to abiraterone-prednisone). At the primary analysis (median follow-up 25·7 months [IQR 23·0-28·9]), median radiographic progression-free survival was 22·6 months (95% CI 19·4-27·4) in the apalutamide plus abiraterone-prednisone group versus 16·6 months (13·9-19·3) in the abiraterone-prednisone group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·69, 95% CI 0·58-0·83; p<0·0001). At the updated analysis (final analysis for overall survival; median follow-up 54·8 months [IQR 51·5-58·4]), median radiographic progression-free survival was 24·0 months (95% CI 19·7-27·5) versus 16·6 months (13·9-19·3; HR 0·70, 95% CI 0·60-0·83; p<0·0001). The most common grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse event was hypertension (82 [17%] of 490 patients receiving apalutamide plus abiraterone-prednisone and 49 [10%] of 489 receiving abiraterone-prednisone). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 195 (40%) patients receiving apalutamide plus abiraterone-prednisone and 181 (37%) patients receiving abiraterone-prednisone. Drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events with fatal outcomes occurred in three (1%) patients in the apalutamide plus abiraterone-prednisone group (2 pulmonary embolism, 1 cardiac failure) and five (1%) patients in the abiraterone-prednisone group (1 cardiac failure and 1 cardiac arrest, 1 mesenteric arterial occlusion, 1 seizure, and 1 sudden death).  Interpretation:   Despite the use of an active and established therapy as the comparator, apalutamide plus abiraterone-prednisone improved radiographic progression-free survival.

As one of them, LINC00992 (LNC992) has been revealed by bioinformatics prediction to be significantly overexpressed in PCa. However, the underlying mechanism of LNC992 in PCa has not been well investigated.  Methods:   First, gene expression microarrays of prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) were downloaded from the GEO database, and differentially expressed genes were analyzed. Subsequently, we assessed the LNC992 expression in PCa patients. PCa cells with overexpression or low expression of LNC992 were generated, followed by the examination of proliferation, invasion and migration in vitro and in vivo. The differentially expressed genes were analyzed by microarrays after altering LNC992 expression in PCa cells, and the downstream regulatory mechanisms of LNC992 were analyzed by bioinformatics analysis and validated by RIP and RNA pull-down assays.  Results:   LNC992 was highly expressed in the PRAD database and in cancer tissues from PCa patients, serving as a poor prognostic factor for PCa patients. Knockdown of LNC992 significantly inhibited PCa cell growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we found that knockdown of LNC992 significantly suppressed SOX4 expression in cells and that LNC992 could bind to EIF4A3 and promote the translation of SOX4. Inhibition of either EIF4A3 or SOX4 significantly suppressed the growth and metastasis of PCa cells.  Conclusions:   LNC992 elevates SOX4 expression by binding to SOX4 mRNA and recruiting translation initiation factor EIF4A3, thereby promoting the growth and metastasis of PCa cells in vitro and in vivo.""","""['Changde Fu', 'Jun Xin', 'Wei Zhang', 'Jinjin Lai', 'Zhiyang Huang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Exp Cell Res""","""['The SOX4/miR-17-92/RB1 Axis Promotes Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'SOX4 is associated with poor prognosis in prostate cancer and promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition in vitro.', 'MicroRNA-92a Inhibits the Cell Viability and Metastasis of Prostate Cancer by Targeting SOX4.', 'Estrogen induces androgen-repressed SOX4 expression to promote progression of prostate cancer cells.', 'lncRNA BG981369 Inhibits Cell Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion, and Promotes Cell Apoptosis by SRY-Related High-Mobility Group Box 4 (SOX4) Signaling Pathway in Human Gastric Cancer.', 'EIF4A3 serves as a prognostic and immunosuppressive microenvironment factor and inhibits cell apoptosis in bladder cancer.', 'Importance of long non-coding RNAs in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Global Gene Expression Regulation Mediated by TGFβ Through H3K9me3 Mark.', 'The Association of MEG3 Gene rs7158663 Polymorphism With Cancer Susceptibility.']"""

We thus investigated the appropriate length of time before completing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) monitoring after treatment.  Patients and methods:   Between 2003 and 2014, 710 localized, intermediate-risk PCa patients underwent LDR-BT with or without supplemental external beam radiotherapy (EBRT).

We stratified patients by posttreatment PSA levels at specific times and assessed the factors for association with biochemical recurrence (BCR) and for clinical progression (CP).  Results:   The median follow-up was 109 months (range, 60-205 months). Of 529 patients who were BCR-free at 3 years after treatment, 56 subsequently developed BCR, and 47 developed CP.

Patients diagnosed with AD were invited to participate in a randomized controlled trial on the cost-effectiveness of psychological treatment. Participation in this trial was used as a proxy of acceptance of psychological treatment. Logistic regression analyses were used to investigate associated factors.  Results:   The overall prevalence of AD was estimated at 13.1%. Sensitivity analyses showed prevalence rates of AD of 11.5%, 15.0%, and 23.5%. Acceptance of psychological treatment was estimated at 65%. AD was associated both with being employed (OR = 3.3, CI = 1.3-8.4) and having a shorter time since diagnosis (OR = 0.3, CI = 0.1-0.8).  Conclusion:   Taking sensitivity analysis into account, the prevalence of AD among cancer patients is estimated at 13 to 15%, and is related to being employed and having a shorter time since diagnosis.

Here, we constructed multifunctional nanoparticles, namely AS1411@MPDA-DTX (AMD) for targeted and synergistic chemotherapy/photothermal therapy of prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Mesoporous polydopamine (MPDA) nanoparticles were prepared by a one-pot synthesis method, DTX was loaded through incubation, and AS1411 aptamer was modified onto MPDA by the covalent reaction. The prepared nanoparticles were characterized by ultra-micro spectrophotometer, Fourier transform infrared spectra, transmission electron microscope, and so on. The targeting ability was detected by selective uptake and cell killing. The mechanism of AMD-mediated synergistic therapy was detected by Western blot and immunofluorescence.  Results:   The prepared nanoparticles can be easily synthesized and possessed excellent water solubility, stability, and controlled drug release ability, preferentially in acidic context. Based on in vitro and in vivo results, the nanoparticles can efficiently target prostate cancer cells, promote DTX internalization, and enhance the antitumor effects of chemo-photothermal therapy strategies under the NIR laser irradiation.  Conclusions:   As a multifunctional nanoplatform, AS1411@MPDA-DTX could efficiently target prostate cancer cells, promote DTX internalization, and synergistically enhance the antiprostate cancer efficiency by combining with NIR irradiation.""","""['Liang Dai', 'Dapeng Wei', 'Jidong Zhang', 'Tianyu Shen', 'Yuming Zhao', 'Junqiang Liang', 'Wangteng Ma', 'Limin Zhang', 'Qingli Liu', 'Yue Zheng']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cell Prolif""","""['Multifunctional Mesoporous Polydopamine With Hydrophobic Paclitaxel For Photoacoustic Imaging-Guided Chemo-Photothermal Synergistic Therapy.', 'Synergistic chemo-photothermal cancer therapy of pH-responsive polymeric nanoparticles loaded IR825 and DTX with charge-reversal property.', 'Tumor targeting and penetrating biomimetic mesoporous polydopamine nanoparticles facilitate photothermal killing and autophagy blocking for synergistic tumor ablation.', 'Recent developments in mesoporous polydopamine-derived nanoplatforms for cancer theranostics.', 'Insights into Aptamer-Drug Delivery Systems against Prostate Cancer.', 'Computable structured aptamer for targeted treatment of ovarian cancer.', 'Synergistic action of lactoferrin in enhancing the safety and effectiveness of docetaxel treatment against prostate cancer.', 'Multifunctional nanoparticle for cancer therapy.', 'Nanoparticles as Physically- and Biochemically-Tuned Drug Formulations for Cancers Therapy.', 'DNA aptamer-based dual-responsive nanoplatform for targeted MRI and combination therapy for cancer.']"""

This study aims to analyze the genetic basis of PCa susceptibility in Mexican men by analyzing SNPs in the 8q24 locus for the first time.  Methods:   A case-control study was performed in 875 men recruited from the Mexican Social Security Institute, 326 patients with PCa, and 549 non-PCa patients (88 with benign prostatic hyperplasia BPH and 461 healthy controls). The 8q24 locus SNPs: rs16901979, rs16983267, rs1447295, and rs7837328 were genotyped by allelic discrimination assays using TaqMan probes. Statistical analysis was performed using Epi Info statistical 7.0 and SNPstats softwares.  Results:   All genotype frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. No differences were observed in genotype distribution between PCa and non-PCa patients for rs6983267. Under different inheritance models, the rs16901979, rs1447295, and rs7837328 SNPs were associated with PCa (OR = 2.8, 1.8, and 1.72, respectively; Pc < 0.001) when comparing PCa patients against controls. This association remains between PCa and BPH patients under different models (OR = 8.5, 2.2, and 1.9, respectively; Pc < 0.001).

With a particular focus on treatment emergent neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), we analyze cell lines, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and human clinical samples to show the existence of two distinct NEPC subtypes based on the expression of the neuronal transcription factors ASCL1 and NEUROD1. While in cell lines and PDX models these subtypes are mutually exclusive, single-cell analysis of human clinical samples exhibits a more complex tumor structure with subtypes coexisting as separate sub-populations within the same tumor. These tumor sub-populations differ genetically and epigenetically contributing to intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity in human metastases.

Here, we report that a splice variant (SV1) of the human growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor (GHRHR) is capable of transducing biased signal. Differing only at the receptor N terminus, GHRHR predominantly activates Gs while SV1 selectively couples to β-arrestins. Based on the cryogenic electron microscopy structures of SV1 in the apo state or GHRH-bound state in complex with the Gs protein, molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the N termini of GHRHR and SV1 differentiate the downstream signaling pathways, Gs versus β-arrestins. As suggested by mutagenesis and functional studies, it appears that GHRH-elicited signal bias toward β-arrestin recruitment is constitutively mediated by SV1. The level of SV1 expression in prostate cancer cells is also positively correlated with ERK1/2 phosphorylation but negatively correlated with cAMP response.

While sequencing of tumor tissue is considered the standard for identifying patients with BRCA alterations (BRCA+), plasma profiling may provide a minimally invasive option to select patients for rucaparib treatment. Here, we report clinical efficacy in patients with BRCA+ mCRPC identified through central plasma, central tissue, or local genomic testing and enrolled in TRITON2.  Patients and methods:   Patients had progressed after next-generation androgen receptor-directed and taxane-based therapies for mCRPC and had BRCA alterations identified by central sequencing of plasma and/or tissue samples or local genomic testing. Concordance of plasma/tissue BRCA status and objective response rate and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rates were summarized.  Results:   TRITON2 enrolled 115 patients with BRCA+ identified by central plasma (n = 34), central tissue (n = 37), or local (n = 44) testing. Plasma/tissue concordance was determined in 38 patients with paired samples and was 47% in 19 patients with a somatic BRCA alteration. No statistically significant differences were observed between objective and PSA response rates to rucaparib across the 3 assay groups. Patients unable to provide tissue samples and tested solely by plasma assay responded at rates no different from patients identified as BRCA+ by tissue testing.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to assist radiologists in the detection and classification of prostatic lesions. Herein, we aimed to develop and test a cascaded deep learning detection and classification system trained on biparametric prostate MRI using PI-RADS for assisting radiologists during prostate MRI read out.  Materials and methods:   T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted (ADC maps, high b value DWI) MRI scans obtained at 3 Tesla from two institutions (n = 1043 in-house and n = 347 Prostate-X, respectively) acquired between 2015 to 2019 were used for model training, validation, testing. All scans were retrospectively reevaluated by one radiologist. Suspicious lesions were contoured and assigned a PI-RADS category. A 3D U-Net-based deep neural network was used to train an algorithm for automated detection and segmentation of prostate MRI lesions. Two 3D residual neural network were used for a 4-class classification task to predict PI-RADS categories 2 to 5 and BPH. Training and validation used 89% (n = 1290 scans) of the data using 5 fold cross-validation, the remaining 11% (n = 150 scans) were used for independent testing. Algorithm performance at lesion level was assessed using sensitivities, positive predictive values (PPV), false discovery rates (FDR), classification accuracy, Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). Additional analysis was conducted to compare AI algorithm's lesion detection performance with targeted biopsy results.  Results:   Median age was 66 years (IQR = 60-71), PSA 6.7 ng/ml (IQR = 4.7-9.9) from in-house cohort. In the independent test set, algorithm correctly detected 111 of 198 lesions leading to 56.1% (49.3%-62.6%) sensitivity. PPV was 62.7% (95% CI 54.7%-70.7%) with FDR of 37.3% (95% CI 29.3%-45.3%). Of 79 true positive lesions, 82.3% were tumor positive at targeted biopsy, whereas of 57 false negative lesions, 50.9% were benign at targeted biopsy. Median DSC for lesion segmentation was 0.359. Overall PI-RADS classification accuracy was 30.8% (95% CI 24.6%-37.8%).

A Multi-Institutional Retrospective Analysis""","""Aims:   Currently, when nodal pelvic oligorecurrent disease is detected, no standard treatment option is recommended. One possible salvage option is nodal stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). Here we analysed recurrence patterns after nodal SBRT in patients affected by pelvic oligometastatic relapse after radical prostatectomy, and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)-free survival in this population.  Materials and methods:   Data on 93 patients consecutively treated in five different institutions for pelvic oligorecurrent disease were reviewed. Inclusion criteria were biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy and imaging showing three or fewer metachronous lymphoadenopathies under aortic bifurcation. Patients underwent SBRT on all sites of disease. Concomitant ADT was allowed.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 20 months (interquartile range 11-41), 57 patients had post-SBRT radiological evidence of relapse, for a median disease-free survival (DFS) of 15 months (95% confidence interval 9-24). Concomitant ADT was administered in 20 patients (21.5%). Overall, eight (8.6%), 21 (22.6%) and 28 (30.1%) patients had prostate bed only, pelvic nodal or distant relapse, respectively. The median ADT-free survival was not reached. Concomitant ADT, International Society for Urologic Pathology pattern at diagnosis < or ≥3, time to relapse ≤ or >12 months, prostate-specific antigen at recurrence < or ≥1.10 ng/ml and prostate-specific membrane antigen staging were not significantly associated with DFS. After relapse, 42 patients (45.2%) received a second SBRT course.  Conclusion:   Nodal SBRT yielded encouraging DFS and ADT-free survival in this population. Only a minority of patients developed prostate bed recurrence, suggesting that local treatment may be safely avoided.

Although many factors have been identified that influence patient involvement in treatment decisions, little is known about the different views that patients have on which factors are most important.  Objective:   This study explores the views of patients with a chronic condition on factors influencing their involvement in treatment decisions.  Design:   Q-methodology was used to study the views of patients. Respondents were asked to rank a set of 42 statements from the least important to the most important for active patient involvement in treatment decision-making. The set of 42 statements was developed based on a literature search and a pilot in which two external researchers, 15 patients and four healthcare professionals participated. A total of 136 patients with one of three major chronic conditions were included: diabetes types 1 and 2, respiratory disease (i.e., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma) and cancer (i.e., breast cancer and prostate cancer). Data were collected in a face-to-face interview setting in the Netherlands.  Results:   Four distinct views on the factors influencing active patient involvement were identified among patients with a chronic condition. (1) Enabled involvement: the extent to which patients are facilitated and empowered to participate will lead to patient involvement. (2) Relationship-driven involvement: the relationship between patients and healthcare professionals drives patient involvement. (3) Disease impact-driven involvement: the severity of disease drives patient involvement. (4) Cognition-driven involvement: knowledge and information drive patient involvement.  Discussion and conclusion:   From the patients' perspective, this study shows that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to involving patients more actively in their healthcare journey. Strategies aiming to enhance active patient involvement among patients with a chronic condition should consider this diversity in perspectives among these patients.  Patient contribution:   Patients are the respondents as this study researches their perspective on factors influencing patient involvement. In addition, patients were involved in pilot-testing the statement set.""","""['Martina Buljac-Samardzic', 'Mark A Clark', 'N Job A van Exel', 'Jeroen D H van Wijngaarden']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Health Expect""","""['The patient experience of patient-centered communication with nurses in the hospital setting: a qualitative systematic review protocol.', 'A qualitative systematic review of internal and external influences on shared decision-making in all health care settings.', 'Exploring views on what is important for patient-centred care in end-stage renal disease using Q methodology.', 'An integrative review exploring the perceptions of patients and healthcare professionals towards patient involvement in promoting hand hygiene compliance in the hospital setting.', 'Interventions for improving the adoption of shared decision making by healthcare professionals.', 'LOFIT (Lifestyle front Office For Integrating lifestyle medicine in the Treatment of patients): a novel care model towards community-based options for lifestyle change-study protocol.', 'Delivering Prognostic News to Older People with Chronic Disease: What Format Preference and Level of Involvement in Decision Making?

This study aimed to create automated machine learning (AutoML) PBCG RC for predicting the probability of any-grade and high-grade prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   This retrospective, single-center study was carried out using the database with 832 patients who were subject to transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values from 2 to 50 ng/ml. Information about PBCG RC predictors was gathered for all patients. We used H2O, as an open-source platform for AutoML, where the set of 20 base learning algorithms were trained. The AutoML PBCG RC was compared in terms of discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility with the original PBCG RC.  Results:   PCa was detected in 341 (41%) men, and 159 (19.1%) of them had high-grade PCa. Our AutoML models demonstrated better discriminative ability than the original PBCG RC for detection of PCa (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.703 vs 0.628; P = 0.023) and high-grade PCa (AUC: 0.990 vs 0.717; P < 0.001). The decision curve analyses showed that AutoML models performed better. For high-grade PCa the PSA was the most important feature.  Conclusions:   We applied ensemble techniques to create a freely available online PCa risk tool based on PBCG RC predictors and AutoML algorithms. The AutoML models drastically improved original model performance and the predictions of high-grade PCa were nearly perfect. However, new models should be used with a reserve, because external validation has not been performed yet.""","""['Miroslav Stojadinovic', 'Bogdan Milicevic', 'Slobodan Jankovic']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Comput Biol Med""","""['A prostate biopsy risk calculator based on MRI: development and comparison of the Prospective Loyola University multiparametric MRI (PLUM) and Prostate Biopsy Collaborative Group (PBCG) risk calculators.', 'A risk calculator to inform the need for a prostate biopsy: a rapid access clinic cohort.', 'External Validation of the Prostate Biopsy Collaborative Group Risk Calculator and the Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator in a Swedish Population-based Screening Cohort.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'The promise of automated machine learning for the genetic analysis of complex traits.']"""

In this respect, [11C]YC-72-AB85 was evaluated as an Hsp90 PET probe in B16.F10 melanoma bearing mice and its brain uptake was determined in rats and nonhuman primate. In vitro binding of [11C]YC-72-AB85 to tissue slices of mouse B16.F10 melanoma, PC3 prostate carcinoma, and rodent brain was evaluated using autoradiography. Biodistribution of [11C]YC-72-AB85 was evaluated in healthy and B16.F10 melanoma mice. In vivo brain uptake was assessed by μPET studies in rats and a rhesus monkey. In vitro binding was deemed Hsp90-specific by blocking studies with heterologous Hsp90 inhibitors onalespib and SNX-0723. Saturable Hsp90 binding was observed in brain, tumor, blood, and blood-rich organs in mice. In combined pretreatment and displacement studies, reversible and Hsp90-specific binding of [11C]YC-72-AB85 was observed in rat brain. Dynamic μPET brain scans in baseline and blocking conditions in a rhesus monkey indicated Hsp90-specific binding. [11C]YC-72-AB85 is a promising PET tracer for in vivo visualization of Hsp90 in tumor and brain.

BMA treatment in mCSPC may therefore constitute overuse.  Methods:   In this retrospective cohort study using linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data, we included patients diagnosed with stage IV prostate adenocarcinoma from 2007 to 2015 who were 66 years of age or older at diagnosis and had received androgen-deprivation or antiandrogen therapy. We excluded patients who had previously received BMAs or had existing osteoporosis, osteopenia, hypercalcemia, or prior bone fracture. The primary outcome was receipt of BMA (zoledronic acid or denosumab) within 180 days of diagnosis (emergence of CRPC within this time frame is unlikely). The secondary outcome was receipt of a BMA within 90 days. Exposures of interest included practice location (physician office vs hospital outpatient) and the specialty (medical oncologist vs urologist) of the treating physician.  Results:   Our sample included 2627 patients, of whom 52.9% were treated by medical oncologists and 47.1% by urologists; 77.7% and 22.3% received care in physician office and hospital outpatient locations, respectively. Overall, 23.6% received a BMA within 180 days; 18.4% did within 90 days. BMA therapy was more common among patients treated by oncologists (odds ratio = 8.23, 95% confidence interval = 6.41 to 10.57) and in physician office locations (odds ratio = 1.33, 95% confidence interval = 1.06 to 1.69). Utilization has increased: 17.3% of patients received BMAs from 2007 to 2009 (17.3% zoledronic acid, 0% denosumab) and 28.1% from 2012 to 2015 (8.4% zoledronic acid, 20.3% denosumab).  Conclusions:   Among patients with mCSPC who had no evidence of high osteoporotic fracture risk, more than one-quarter have received BMAs in recent years.

Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare overall mortality (OM) and cancer-specific mortality (CSM) between AS/WW and focal therapy, and propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to reduce the influence of bias and unmeasured confounders. A total of 19 292 patients with low-risk PCa were included in this study.

This is however an invasive procedure that carries associated risks, hence non-invasive assays to support the diagnostic pathway are much needed. A key feature of disease progression, and subsequent poor prognosis, is the presence of an altered stroma. Here we explored the utility of prostate stromal cell-derived vesicles as indicators of an altered tumour environment. We compared vesicles from six donor-matched pairs of adjacent-normal versus disease-associated primary stromal cultures. We identified 19 differentially expressed transcripts that discriminate disease from normal stromal extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs isolated from patient serum were investigated for these putative disease-discriminating mRNA. A set of transcripts including Caveolin-1 (CAV1), TMP2, THBS1, and CTGF were found to be successful in discriminating clinically insignificant (Gleason = 6) disease from clinically significant (Gleason > 8) prostate cancer. Furthermore, correlation between transcript expression and progression-free survival suggests that levels of these mRNA may predict disease outcome. Informed by a machine learning approach, combining measures of the five most informative EV-associated mRNAs with PSA was shown to significantly improve assay sensitivity and specificity. An in-silico model was produced, showcasing the superiority of this multi-modal liquid biopsy compared to needle biopsy for predicting disease progression. This proof of concept highlights the utility of serum EV analytics as a companion diagnostic test with prognostic utility, which may obviate the need for biopsy.""","""['Alex P Shephard', 'Peter Giles', 'Mariama Mbengue', 'Amr Alraies', 'Lisa K Spary', 'Howard Kynaston', 'Mark J Gurney', 'Juan M Falcón-Pérez', 'Félix Royo', 'Zsuzsanna Tabi', 'Dimitris Parthimos', 'Rachel J Errington', 'Aled Clayton', 'Jason P Webber']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Extracell Vesicles""","""['Affinity Captured Urinary Extracellular Vesicles Provide mRNA and miRNA Biomarkers for Improved Accuracy of Prostate Cancer Detection: A Pilot Study.', 'Distinct prostate cancer-related mRNA cargo in extracellular vesicle subsets from prostate cell lines.', 'Extracellular vesicles: the next generation of biomarkers for liquid biopsy-based prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Asporin is a stromally expressed marker associated with prostate cancer progression.', 'Extracellular vesicles for liquid biopsy in prostate cancer: where are we and where are we headed?', 'Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Heterogeneity, Activation and Function: Implications for Prostate Cancer.', 'Cancer secretome: finding out hidden messages in extracellular secretions.', 'Current perspectives on clinical use of exosomes as novel biomarkers for cancer diagnosis.']"""

OBJECTIVE: To assess treatment utilization patterns of newly initiated oral anticancer agents across national samples of Medicare beneficiaries for 5 cancer types: chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), multiple myeloma (MM), metastatic prostate cancer (mPC), metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), and metastatic breast cancer (mBC). METHODS: This retrospective claims analysis used 100% Medicare Chronic Condition Data Warehouse (CCW) Parts A, B, and D files from 2011 to 2014 (for CML, MM, mPC, and mRCC patients) and a 5% random fee-for-service sample from 2011 to 2013 (for mBC patients). Outcomes of interest were the number of 30-day supply prescriptions, adherence, and discontinuation of newly initiated (ie, index) oral anticancer agents indicated for each of the cancers. Adherence was calculated with both the ""traditional"" proportion of days covered (PDC) approach, measured over a fixed 1-year period or until hospice/death, and a ""modified"" PDC approach, measured over the time between the first and last fill of the index oral anticancer agent. Patients with PDC of at least 0.80 were deemed as being adherent. Discontinuation was defined as the presence of a continuous 90-day gap in the availability of days supply of the index oral anticancer agent. RESULTS: Our study included 1,650, 7,461, 6,998, 2,553, and 79 patients for CML, MM, mPC, mRCC, and mBC, respectively. Patients with mRCC had the highest proportion of patients with only 1 fill of their index anticancer agent (28%) followed by mBC (17%), MM (17%), mPC (12%), and CML (12%). Patients with CML had the highest mean (SD) number of 30-day supply equivalent prescriptions (8.3 [4.6]), followed by patients with mPC (6.5 [4.2]), MM (5.7 [4.1]), mBC (4.7 [3.2]), and mRCC (4.5 [3.9]). Using the modified PDC measured between the first and last fills, approximately three-quarters of patients with CML (74%), mRCC (71%), and mBC (70%) were adherent to the index oral anticancer agent. Adherence was highest for patients with mPC (87%) and lowest for patients with MM (58%). The percentage of patients defined as adherent to the index oral anticancer agent decreased for all cancers when using the traditional PDC measure over a fixed 1-year period: CML (54%), MM (35%), mPC (48%), mRCC (37%), and mBC (22%). Rates of discontinuation for patients in our sample were 32% (CML), 38% (mPC), 42% (mRCC), 48% (MM), and 58% (mBC). CONCLUSIONS: Between 13% and 42% of Medicare patients were nonadherent between the first and last fill of their newly initiated oral anticancer therapies across a range of cancers. This study provides a valuable benchmark for stakeholders seeking to measure and improve adherence to oral anticancer agents in Medicare patients.

Methods:   In February 2021, we retrospectively assessed the outcomes of 129 patients who received between April 2013 and May 2020 hypofractionated post-operative radiotherapy using Helical Tomotherapy. Toxicity was assessed using CTCAE criteria v4.0. Survival endpoints were calculated with Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   Median age and follow-up were, respectively, 67 years and 43 months. Adjuvant and salvage treatment were delivered to 63.5% and 36.4% of patients to a median total dose of 63.8 Gy (61.6-65.25 Gy) in 29 fractions (2.12-2.25 Gy/fraction). Pelvic lymph-nodes irradiation was performed in 67.4% of cases. ADT was added in 50%. Acute toxicity was: G1 and G2 GU events in 36% and 9.3% of cases; G1 and G2 GI events in 29.4% and 13.9%. Late GU toxicity occurred in 12.4% of cases: 3.1% G1, 7.7% G2 and 1.5% G3 events; GI toxicity consisted of 1.5% G1 and 7.7% G2 events. Biochemical relapse occurred in 26.3% of cases, recording no significant differences between adjuvant and salvage (p = 0.67), with 4- and 5-years bRFS rates of 78.7% and 75.6%. Two patients died of progressive disease and eight for non-oncological causes resulting in 3-years overall survival and cancer-specific survival rates of 98% and 98.4%.  Conclusions:   Our experience supports the use of moderate hypofractionation for prostate bed radiotherapy, with minimal toxicity and promising results in terms of clinical outcomes.""","""['Giuseppe Ferrera', ""Salvatore D'Alessandro"", 'Francesco Cuccia', 'Vincenzo Serretta', 'Giovanna Trapani', 'Gianfranco Savoca', 'Gianluca Mortellaro', 'Antonio Lo Casto']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['Moderate Hypofractionated Postprostatectomy Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy With Daily Image Guidance (VMAT-IGRT): A\xa0Mono-institutional Report on Feasibility and Acute Toxicity.', 'Acute and late toxicity and preliminary outcomes report of moderately hypofractionated helical tomotherapy for localized prostate cancer: a mono-institutional analysis.', 'Comparison of hypofractionation and standard fractionation for post-prostatectomy salvage radiotherapy in patients with persistent PSA: single institution experience.', 'Postoperative Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy in Prostate Carcinoma: A Systematic Review.', 'Hypofractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer in the postoperative setting: What is the evidence so far?', 'Hypofractionated Post-Prostatectomy Radiotherapy in 16 Fractions: A Single-Institution Outcome.', 'Acute Toxicity and Quality of Life in a Post-Prostatectomy Ablative Radiation Therapy (POPART) Multicentric Trial.']"""

Its prognostic value, however, in nonmetastatic prostate cancer (NMPC) is still unclear.  Purpose:   To elucidate whether CTCs can predict the biochemical recurrence (BCR) in NMPC patients following radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiotherapy (RT).  Methods:   PubMed, Cochrane Database, and Embase and the references in relevant studies were systematically searched. Studies that investigated the correlation of CTCs and BCR in NMPC patients after RP or RT were identified and reviewed. Overall odds ratio (OR) of BCR in such patients with/without CTCs was pooled. We also calculated and pooled overall prevalence of BCR in such CTC-positive patients.  Results:   In total, 12 studies comprising 1917 participants were eligible for the meta-analysis and showed that the presence of secondary circulating tumor cells (SCTCs) is associated with a higher BCR rate of 59% (95% CI: 22%-88%) in patients with NMPC after RP or RT (OR = 6.12; 95% CI: 2.22-16.85; P < 0.001). However, regardless of the presence of primary circulating tumor cells (PCTCs), it has not been shown to be associated with higher BCR.  Conclusions:   Our research demonstrated that SCTC-positive patients are associated with higher BCR compared to SCTC-negative patients in NMPC. Therefore, it is recommended that NMPC patients undergo CTC surveillance intensively after RP or RT.""","""['Liang Cao', 'Peng Hao', 'Dong Lin', 'Yangming Li', 'Tinghui Hu', 'Tao Cai', 'Shu Cui', 'Tao Wu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Biomed Res Int""","""['Limited prognostic value of preoperative circulating tumor cells for early biochemical recurrence in patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Perineural invasion as an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Detection of Circulating Tumor Cells in Locally Advanced High-risk Prostate Cancer During Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy and Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Prediction of Biochemical Recurrence Following Radiotherapy among Patients with Persistent PSA after Radical Prostatectomy: A Single-Center Experience.', 'Positive surgical margin is associated with biochemical recurrence risk following radical prostatectomy: a meta-analysis from high-quality retrospective cohort studies.', 'Insights into Circulating Tumor Cell Clusters: A Barometer for Treatment Effects and Prognosis for Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Predictive Value of Circulating Tumor Cells Detected by ISET® in Patients with Non-Metastatic Prostate Cancer Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

The ExoDx Prostate (IntelliScore) (EPI) test is a noninvasive liquid biopsy that quantifies three RNA targets in urine exosomes. The EPI test stratifies patients for risk of high-grade prostate cancer (HGPC; ≥ Grade Group 2 [GG] PC) in men ≥ 50 years with equivocal prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (2-10 ng/mL). Here, we present a pooled meta-analysis from three independent prospective-validation studies in men presenting for initial biopsy decision.  Methods:   Pooled data from two prospective multi-site validation studies and the control arm of a clinical utility study were analyzed. Performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), negative predictive value (NPV), positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, and specificity for discriminating ≥ GG2 from GG1 and benign pathology.  Results:   The combined cohort (n = 1212) of initial-biopsy subjects had a median age of 63 years and median PSA of 5.2 ng/mL. The EPI AUC (0.70) was superior to PSA (0.56), Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial Risk Calculator (PCPT-RC) (0.62), and The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) (0.59), (all p-values <0.001) for discriminating GG2 from GG1 and benign histology. The validated cutoff of 15.6 would avoid 23% of all prostate biopsies and 30% of ""unnecessary"" (benign or Gleason 6/GG1) biopsies, with an NPV of 90%.  Conclusions:   EPI is a noninvasive, easy-to-use, urine exosome-RNA assay that has been validated across 3 independent prospective multicenter clinical trials with 1212 subjects. The test can discriminate high-grade (≥GG2) from low-grade (GG1) cancer and benign disease.

However, the survival benefit with CBZ for patients with CRPC is limited. This study used screening tests for candidate drugs targeting CBZ-resistant-related gene expression and identified pimozide as a potential candidate for overcoming CBZ resistance in CRPC.  Methods:   We established CBZ-resistant cell lines, DU145CR and PC3CR by incubating DU145 cells and PC3 cells with gradually increasing concentrations of CBZ. We performed in silico drug screening for candidate drugs that could reprogram the gene expression signature of a CBZ-resistant prostate cancer cells using a Connectivity Map. The in vivo effect of the drug combination was tested in xenograft mice models.  Results:   We identified pimozide as a promising candidate drug for CBZ-resistant CRPC. Pimozide had a significant antitumor effect on DU145CR cells. Moreover, combination treatment with pimozide and CBZ had a synergic effect for DU145CR cells in vitro and in vivo. Microarray analysis identified AURKB and KIF20A as potential targets of pimozide in CBZ-resistant CRPC. DU145CR had significantly higher AURKB and KIF20A expression compared with a non-CBZ-resistant cell line. Inhibition of AURKB and KIF20A had an antitumor effect in DU145CR xenograft tumors. Higher expression of AURKB and KIF20A was a poor prognostic factor of TGCA prostate cancer cohort. CBZ-resistant prostate cancer tissues in our institution had higher AURKB and KIF20A expression.

AR splice variant-7 (AR-V7) is a truncated variant of AR that leads to AR inhibitor therapy resistance in prostate cancer; recent studies have identified AR-V7 in BC and theorized that AR-V7 can have a similar impact. This study assessed the prevalence and clinicopathologic features associated with AR-V7 in a large BC cohort. BC samples were evaluated by MSK-Fusion targeted RNAseq for AR-V7 detection and MSK-IMPACT targeted DNAseq, including triple-negative tumors with no driver alteration and estrogen receptor-positive/ESR1 wildtype tumors progressing on therapy. Among 196 primary and metastatic/recurrent cases (196 RNAseq, 194DNAseq), 9.7% (19/196) were AR-V7 positive and 90.3% (177/196) AR-V7 negative. All AR-V7 positive BC were AR-positive by immunohistochemistry (19/19). The prevalence of AR-V7 by receptor subtype (N = 189) was: 18% (12/67) in ER-/PgR-/HER2-negative BC, 3.7% (4/109) in ER-positive/HER2-negative BC, and 15.4% (2/13) in HER2-positive BC; AR-V7 was detected in one ER-positive/HER2-unknown BC. Apocrine morphology was observed in 42.1% (8/19) of AR-V7 positive BC and 3.4% (6/177) AR-V7 negative BC (P < 0.00001). Notably, AR-V7 was detected in 2 primary BC and 7 metastatic/recurrent BC patients with no prior endocrine therapy. We conclude that positive AR IHC and apocrine morphology are pathologic features that may indicate testing for AR-V7 is warranted in both primary and metastatic BC in the appropriate clinical context.

Prespecified coprimary endpoints were 2-year overall survival (OS) and PSA progression. Secondary endpoints included 2-year SABR-treated local failure and 6-month adverse events. Correlative studies included peripheral blood T-cell subpopulations before and after SABR.  Results:   128 lesions in 89 patients were included in this analysis. Median OS was 29.3 months, and 1- and 2-year OS were 96% and 80%, respectively. PSA PFS was 40% at 1 year and 21% at 2 years.

Methods and analysis:   The ReIMAGINE Prostate Cancer Screening Study is a prospective single-centre feasibility study. Eligible men aged 50-75 years with no prior prostate cancer diagnosis or treatment will be identified through general practitioner practices and randomly selected for invitation. Those invited will be offered an MRI scan and a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test. The screening MRI scan consists of T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted and research-specific sequences, without the use of intravenous contrast agents. Men who screen positive on either MRI or PSA density will be recommended to have standard of care (National Health Service) tests for prostate cancer assessment, which includes multiparametric MRI. The study will assess the acceptability of an MRI-based prostate screening assessment and the prevalence of cancer detected in MRI-screened men. Summary statistics will be used to explore baseline characteristics in relation to acceptance rates and prevalence of cancer.  Ethics and dissemination:   ReIMAGINE Prostate Cancer Screening is a single-site screening study to assess the feasibility of MRI as a screening tool for prostate cancer.

The present study aimed to evaluate 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) as a potential endocrine factor regulating proliferation and vitamin D receptor expression in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.  Materials and methods:   Cell counting after treatment was utilized to assess the effect of 25(OH)D3 on cell proliferation. Changes in mRNA expression of the vitamin D receptors, VDR and PDIA3, were evaluated using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR).  Results:   25(OH)D3 inhibited cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect of 25(OH)D3 on cell proliferation was potentiated after inhibition of CYP17B1 and CYP24 by genistein, preventing further metabolism of 25(OH)D3 to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (24,25(OH)2D3). Expression of PDIA3 and VDR mRNA increased after treatment with 25(OH)D3, whereas the ratio between PDIA3 and VDR mRNA remained unchanged.  Conclusion:   25(OH)D3 has a direct inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, which is enhanced and accelerated when the metabolism of 25(OH)D3 to 1,25(OH)2D3 and 24,25(OH)2D3 was inhibited by the CYP17B1 and CYP24 inhibitor genistein.

Alternative splicing is a feature of aggressive prostate cancer (CRPC) and enables the generation of the anti-androgen resistant version of the ligand-independent androgen receptor, AR-v7. We show that CDK9 inhibition results in the loss of AR and AR-v7 expression due to the defects in splicing, which sensitizes CRPC cells to androgen deprivation.

Usual (acinar) intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDC-P) is a noninvasive high-risk lesion typically associated with high-grade, high-stage prostate cancer. Whereas there have been rare biopsy studies of pure acinar IDC-P or IDC-P associated with only low-grade carcinoma, there have been no analogous series of IDC-P with cribriform or papillary ductal morphology on biopsy unassociated with invasive high-grade carcinoma. We identified 14 patients with biopsies showing IDC-P with ductal morphology, defined as prostatic duct adenocarcinoma confined to glands/ducts with immunohistochemically proven retention of basal cells. Our series includes 12 patients with pure IDC-P and 2 patients with concurrent low-volume Grade Group 1 invasive cancer in unassociated cores. Three patients underwent radical prostatectomy: 2/3 had high-grade cancer in their resection specimen (Grade Group 3, Grade Group 5), including 1 with advanced stage and nodal metastases; 1/3 had Grade Group 1 organ-confined carcinoma and spatially distinct IDC-P with ductal morphology. Five men had only follow-up biopsies: 2/5 had cancer (Grade Group 2, Grade Group 4); 1/5 had IDC-P (on 2 repeat biopsies); and 2/5 had benign transurethral resection of the prostate. In all 5 cases with invasive cancer, the invasive portion was comprised purely of acinar morphology; no invasive ductal component was identified. Five patients did not have follow-up biopsies and were treated with radiation therapy±androgen deprivation. One patient had no follow-up information. In an analogous situation to acinar IDC-P, we propose that rarely there is a precursor form of ductal adenocarcinoma that can exist without concurrent invasive high-grade carcinoma and propose the term ""IDC-P with ductal morphology,"" consistent with the terminology for acinar prostate adenocarcinoma. Until more evidence is accumulated, we recommend reporting and treating patients with IDC-P with ductal morphology in a manner analogous to those with acinar IDC-P. As with pure IDC-P with acinar morphology, we would also recommend not grading pure IDC-P with ductal morphology. Finally, we propose a new addition to the diagnostic criteria of IDC-P to include intraductal lesions with ductal morphology consisting of papillary fronds or cribriform lesions lined by cytologically atypical pseudostratified epithelium.""","""['Daniel H Russell', 'Jonathan I Epstein']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['PIN-like (Ductal) Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate.', 'High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasialike ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate: a clinicopathologic study of 28 cases.', 'High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, PIN-like carcinoma, ductal carcinoma, and intraductal carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Heterogeneous clinicopathological features of intraductal carcinoma of the prostate: a comparison between ""precursor-like"" and ""regular type"" lesions.', 'Atypical cribriform lesions of the prostate: clinical significance, differential diagnosis and current concept of intraductal carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Comparison of Survival Outcomes and Risk Factors Between Ductal Carcinoma of the Prostate and Acinar Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate: A Population-based Propensity Score-matching Study.']"""

Patients and methods:   Retrospectively collected data from 587 patients who underwent inpatient rehabilitation after RP in 2016 and 2017 were analyzed. Psychosocial distress (measured by using a Questionnaire on Stress in Cancer Patients [QSC-R10]) and continence status (urine loss on a 24-h pad test and urine volume on uroflowmetry) were evaluated at the beginning (T1) and end (T2) of a 3-week inpatient rehabilitation.

At the start of rehabilitation, 204 patients (34.8%) demonstrated high distress. Psychosocial distress decreased significantly (p < 0.001) from a median of 11.0 at T1 (median 16 days after surgery) to a median of 6.0 at T2 (median 37 days after surgery).

Results:   One hundred twelve of 120 patients consented. Their median age was 72 years and median follow-up was 2.3 years. As per National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, 78% had intermediate risk and 20% high risk. Androgen deprivation was combined with radiation in 6 patients.

A new formulation of spacers (I-SPs) incorporates iodine to improve radiopacity and CT visualization. We characterized placement, stability, and plan quality of I-SPs compared to nonI-SPs.  Methods and materials:   Patients with intact prostate cancer (n = 50) treated with I-SPs and photons were compared to randomly selected patients (n = 50) with nonI-SPs (photon or proton therapy). The I-SP was contoured on the planning CT and cone beam CTs at 3 timepoints: first, middle, and final treatment (n = 200 scans). I-SPs Hounsfield units (HU), volume, surface area (SA), centroid position relative to prostate centroid, and distance between prostate/rectum centroids were compared on the planning CTs between each cohort. I-SP changes were evaluated on cone beam CTs over courses of treatment. Dosimetric evaluations of plan quality and robustness were performed. I-SP was tested in a phantom to characterize its relative linear stopping power for protons.  Results:   I-SPs yielded a distinct visible contrast on planning CTs compared to nonI-SPs (HU 138 vs 12, P < .001), allowing delineation on CT alone. The delineated volume and SA of I-SPs were smaller than nonI-SPs (volume 8.9 vs 10.6 mL, P < .001; SA 28 vs 35 cm2, P < .001), yet relative spacer position and prostate-rectal separation were similar (P = .79). No significant change in HU, volume, SA, or relative position of the I-SPs hydrogel occurred over courses of treatment (all P > .1). Dosimetric analysis concluded there were no significant changes in plan quality or robustness for I-SPs compared to nonI-SPs. The I-SP relative linear stopping power was 1.018, necessitating HU override for proton planning.  Conclusions:   I-SPs provide a manifest CT contrast, allowing for delineation on planning CT alone with no magnetic resonance imaging necessary.

The aim was to estimate the impact of androgen deprivation therapy on mortality from COVID-19 in men with prevalent prostate cancer by comparing all-cause mortality in the spring of 2020 to that in previous years.

Exposure to androgen deprivation therapy was ascertained from filled prescriptions for bicalutamide monotherapy, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH), or bilateral orchidectomy.  Results:   A total of 9,822 men died in March-June in the years 2015-2020, of whom 5,034 men were on androgen deprivation therapy. There was an excess mortality in 2020 vs previous years in all men. The crude relative mortality rate ratio for 2020 vs 2015-2019 was 0.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.04) in men on GnRH, and 0.90 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.05) in men on bicalutamide monotherapy.

Network maps were produced to identify authors' and countries' collaboration clusters.  Results:   Between 2006 and 2020, 574 publications fulfilling the inclusion criteria were identified, and a significant growth trend in publication (P<0.0001) and citation (P=0.001) number was recognized over the period. The United States was the most productive country with 253 (44.2%) articles. The RED Journal had the highest number of publications (14%) and citations (19%). Urology journals published (P=0.01) and cited significantly less than radiation oncology journals (P=0.01). All open access and non-open access number of publications increased over time, with a significant difference between non-open access and open access journals (P<0.0001). Two author clusters were identified, in the United States with the collaboration of Canadian and British authors, and in Italy with the participation of European authors.  Conclusion:   The number of publications and citations on SBRT for prostate cancer has grown linearly in the last decades. The United States is the leading country in this research field, and the use of SBRT in oligometastatic disease, reirradiation, and salvage seems to be hot topics in this research field.""","""['Gustavo A Viani', 'Andre G Gouveia', 'Alexandre A Jacinto', 'Fabio Y Moraes']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Am J Clin Oncol""","""['Bibliometric Analysis of the Top-Cited Publications and Research Trends for Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy.', 'The one hundred most cited publications in prostate brachytherapy.', 'The publication impact of the first 100 THOR Network publications by bibliometric and social network analyses.', 'Top 100 most-cited articles on exosomes in the field of cancer: a bibliometric analysis and evidence mapping.', 'The 100 top-cited publications in psoriatic arthritis: a bibliometric analysis.', 'Bibliometric and altmetric analyses of publication activity in the field of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy in 2011-2021 based on web of science core collection databases.']"""

The contribution of the gut microbiota to the emergence of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) has not yet been addressed. We found that androgen deprivation in mice and humans promotes the expansion of defined commensal microbiota that contributes to the onset of castration resistance in mice. Specifically, the intestinal microbial community in mice and patients with CRPC was enriched for species capable of converting androgen precursors into active androgens. Ablation of the gut microbiota by antibiotic therapy delayed the emergence of castration resistance even in immunodeficient mice. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from CRPC mice and patients rendered mice harboring prostate cancer resistant to castration. In contrast, tumor growth was controlled by FMT from hormone-sensitive prostate cancer patients and Prevotella stercorea administration. These results reveal that the commensal gut microbiota contributes to endocrine resistance in CRPC by providing an alternative source of androgens.""","""['Nicolò Pernigoni#', 'Elena Zagato#', 'Arianna Calcinotto#', 'Martina Troiani', 'Ricardo Pereira Mestre', 'Bianca Calì', 'Giuseppe Attanasio', 'Jacopo Troisi', 'Mirko Minini', 'Simone Mosole', 'Ajinkya Revandkar', 'Emiliano Pasquini', 'Angela Rita Elia', 'Daniela Bossi', 'Andrea Rinaldi', 'Pasquale Rescigno', 'Penny Flohr', 'Joanne Hunt', 'Antje Neeb', 'Lorenzo Buroni', 'Christina Guo', 'Jonathan Welti', 'Matteo Ferrari', 'Matteo Grioni', 'Josée Gauthier', 'Raad Z Gharaibeh', 'Anna Palmisano', 'Gladys Martinetti Lucchini', ""Eugenia D'Antonio"", 'Sara Merler', 'Marco Bolis', 'Fabio Grassi', 'Antonio Esposito', 'Matteo Bellone', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Maria Rescigno', 'Jean-Philippe Theurillat', 'Christian Jobin', 'Silke Gillessen', 'Johann de Bono', 'Andrea Alimonti']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Science""","""['Gut bacteria enable prostate cancer growth.', 'A microbiome short circuit in prostate cancer.', 'Intestinal microbiota drive CRPC.', 'Bacterial sabotage.', 'Uro-Science.', 'Nuclear receptor ERRα contributes to castration-resistant growth of prostate cancer via its regulation of intratumoral androgen biosynthesis.', 'Effects of androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer on gut microbiota and treatment.', 'Androgen biosynthesis in castration-resistant prostate cancer: Advances in studies.', 'The role of adrenal derived androgens in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'BMX-Mediated Regulation of Multiple Tyrosine Kinases Contributes to Castration Resistance in Prostate Cancer.', 'Microbiota as the unifying factor behind the hallmarks of cancer.', 'The potential role of the microbiota in prostate cancer pathogenesis and treatment.', 'Lactate as Key Metabolite in Prostate Cancer Progression: What Are the Clinical Implications?', 'Bacteria in cancer initiation, promotion and progression.', 'Gut OncoMicrobiome Signatures (GOMS) as next-generation biomarkers for cancer immunotherapy.']"""

The study objectives were to develop a SDM training video, measure usability and satisfaction, and determine the effect of the intervention on preparing patients to participate in clinical appointments.  Methods:   A randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare a plain-language decision aid (DA) to the DA plus a patient SDM training video. Patients with early stage prostate cancer completed survey measures at baseline and after reviewing the intervention materials. Survey items assessed patients' knowledge, beliefs related to SDM, and perceived readiness/intention to participate in their upcoming clinical appointment.  Results:   Of those randomized to the DA + SDM video group, most participants (91%) watched the video and 93% would recommend the video to others. Participants in the DA + SDM video group, compared to the DA-only group, reported an increased desire to participate in the decision (mean = 3.65 v. 3.39, P < 0.001), less decision urgency (mean = 2.82 v. 3.39, P < 0.001), and improved self-efficacy for communicating with physicians (mean = 4.69 v. 4.50, P = 0.05). These participants also reported increased intentions to seek a referral from a radiation oncologist (73% v. 51%, P = 0.004), to take notes (mean = 3.23 v. 2.86, P = 0.004), and to record their upcoming appointments (mean = 1.79 v. 1.43, P = 0.008).  Conclusions:   A novel SDM training video was accepted by patients and changed several measures associated with SDM.

However, little is known about the causal direction of the association.  Objectives:   To explore the potential causal relation between circulating phosphorus and risk of prostate cancer, we conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) study.  Methods:   Summary statistics of prostate cancer were obtained from a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) consisting of 79,148 cases and 61,106 controls. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with serum phosphorus concentration were selected from a GWAS of 291,408 individuals from the UK Biobank. MR analysis was performed using the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, supplemented with simple median method, weighted median method, maximum likelihood-based method, MR-Egger regression, and the MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier test. We also performed a meta-analysis of observational studies to assess the associations of dietary phosphorus intake and serum phosphorus concentration with risk of prostate cancer.  Results:   In the MR analysis, a total of 125 independent SNPs associated with serum phosphorus concentrations were used as instrumental variables. Genetically predicted serum phosphorus concentrations were associated with a 19% increased risk of prostate cancer (95% CI: 9%, 31%) per 1-SD increment of serum phosphorus by IVW (P = 1.82 × 10-4). Sensitivity analyses using alternative MR methods produced similar positive associations, and no evidence of pleiotropy was detected by MR-Egger regression (P = 0.422). For meta-analysis, 8 studies for dietary phosphorus intake and 4 for serum phosphorus concentrations were included involving a total of 669,080 participants. Consistently, high dietary phosphorus intake and serum phosphorus concentrations were associated with an 8% (95% CI: 4%, 12%) and 7% (95% CI: 1%, 14%) increase in prostate cancer risk, respectively.

The current study was designed to investigate the effects of Chinese medicine Zhoushi Qi Ling decoction on the docetaxel resistance of prostate cancer as well as elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism. In our study, Qi Ling significantly decreased viability and colony formation as well as increased apoptosis of docetaxel-resistant (DR) CRPC cells. Qi Ling-treated DR cells exhibited decreased glucose consumption, lactate release and pyruvate production. Moreover, lncRNA SNHG10 was upregulated in DR tissues of CRPC patients and was negatively correlated with the progression-free survival. Bioinformatics analysis indicated miR-1271-5p as the associated miRNA possibly binding with SNHG10. miR-1271-5p up-regulation dramatically decreased the luciferase activity of SNHG10 in DR cells. SNHG10 knockdown sharply increased the expression of miR1271-5p in DR cells. Targetscan predicted TRIM66 as one of the downstream targets of miR-1271-5p. miR-1271-5p up-regulation drastically reduced luciferase activity as well as TRIM66 expression in DR cells. Also, the knockdown of SNHG10 remarkably suppressed the expression of TRIM66 in DR cells. Additionally, Qi Ling treatment reduced SNHG10 and TRIM66, while increased miR1271-5p, in DR cells.

Methods:   Retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained patient database was conducted for visits between 2013 and 2019. The sexual health rehabilitation action plan (SHRAP) is a standardized 29-item list of biopsychosocial recommendations. The frequency of biopsychosocial recommendations provided to patients via their SHRAPs was assessed.  Results:   Among 913 patients, across 2671 appointments, nearly 74% of patients underwent radical prostatectomy. Other treatments included combination therapy (surgery, radiation, and/or androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)) (13%), radiation (external beam radiation or brachytherapy) (5%), and active surveillance (2%). Each patient had a median of 2 (SD 2.06) appointments and received a mean of 10.0 (SD 3.9) recommendations at each visit. Educational recommendations (penile rehabilitation, orgasmic guidelines, and climacturia management) were provided in 84% of visits followed by psychosexual recommendations (pleasure-focused, dedicated time, simmering, sexual aids, and sensate focus) in 71% of all appointments. The top recommendations (total n, frequency of recommendation) were penile rehabilitation (2253, 84%), pleasure-focus (1887, 71%), phosphodiesterase inhibitors (1655, 62%), clinical counselor (1603, 60%), vacuum erectile device (1418, 53%) and intracavernosal injections (1383, 52%).  Conclusions:   Biopsychosocial programs are evolving to be a key part of prostate cancer survivorship.

Aim:   The aim of our study is to investigate the presence of psychological distress (anxiety and depression) in patients waiting for histopathological results after prostate biopsy (PBx).  Methods:   From February to April 2019, 51 consecutive patients undergoing prostate biopsies at our institution were included. Age, PSA, DRE, familiarity for prostate cancer, number of previous biopsies, type of anesthesia, number of cores were recorded. All patients filled the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), a psychometric Likert-scale questionnaire, before receiving the histopathological results of their PBx.  Results:   The prevalence of psychological distress among patients awaiting histopathologic results is 41% (21/51 patients), with anxiety being the main component of their distress. On multivariate analysis, PSA, family history, and repeat biopsy were significantly associated with anxiety and depression.

Structural changes in the core molecule of noscapine architecture have produced a number of potent analogs. We have recently synthesized the novel noscapine analogs (3, 4, and 5) with different functional groups appended at ninth position of natural noscapine. The anticancer activity of these compounds has been investigated using various human cancer cell lines such as HeLa (cervical cancer), DU-145 (prostate cancer), MCF-7 (breast cancer), and IMR-32 (neuroblastoma). One of the compounds in this series, 9-ethynyl noscapine (5), has demonstrated good anticancer activity against HeLa cells. Biological studies demonstrated that compound 5 decreased cell viability and colony formation in HeLa cells in a concentration dependent manner. To further uncover the mechanism in detail, we evaluated compound 5 effect on cell cycle progression, microtubule dynamics, and apoptosis. Cell cycle and western blotting analysis revealed that 9-ethynyl noscapine treatment resulted in cell cycle arrest at G2/M and decreased CDK1 and cyclinB1 protein expression. We also observed that 9-ethynyl noscapine (5) treatment leads to disruption in tubulin polymerization and induction of apoptosis by decreasing expression of bcl2, pro-caspase 3, and activation of cytochrome C. Taken together, our results indicate that 9-ethynyl noscapine (5) effectively supresses the growth of cervical cancer cells (HeLa) by disrupting tubulin polymerization, cell cycle progression leading to apoptosis.""","""['Praveen Kumar Reddy Nagireddy', 'Dinesh Kumar', 'Vamsi Krishna Kommalapati', 'Ravi Kumar Pedapati', 'Venkateswarlu Kojja', 'Anjana Devi Tangutur', 'Srinivas Kantevari']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Drug Dev Res""","""['Methyl 5-(1H-indol-3-yl)selanyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-ylcarbamate (M-24), a novel tubulin inhibitor, causes G2/M arrest and cell apoptosis by disrupting tubulin polymerization in human cervical and breast cancer cells.', 'Rational design of biaryl pharmacophore inserted noscapine derivatives as potent tubulin binding anticancer agents.', '3-(3-Hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-4-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-1,2,5-selenadiazole (G-1103), a novel combretastatin A-4 analog, induces G2/M arrest and apoptosis by disrupting tubulin polymerization in human cervical HeLa cells and fibrosarcoma HT-1080 cells.', 'Insight into the Tubulin-Targeted Anticancer Potential of Noscapine and its Structural Analogs.', 'Menthol: An underestimated anticancer agent.', 'Development of 9-(N-arylmethylamino) congeners of noscapine: the microtubule targeting drugs for the management of breast cancer.', 'Noscapine-Amino Acid Conjugates Suppress the Progression of Cancer Cells.', 'Cytotoxic effect of disulfiram/copper on human cervical cancer cell lines and LGR5-positive cancer stem-like cells.']"""

Indeed, only alfa-fetoprotein (AFP) in hepatocarcinoma and CA15-3 in breast cancer are clinically monitored for their glycoforms. Aberrant glycosylation occurs frequently in many of the glycoproteins synthesized by tumor cells and often produce changes in protein glycoforms that could be exploited as potential biomarkers for improving diagnosis, prognosis or to study the response to treatment. Ideally, the screening of potential biomarkers should be performed from noninvasive samples like serum or plasma, therefore these glycoproteins with tumor associated-glycoforms should be shed from the tumor cell membrane or secreted into the blood to be detectable. Glycosylation changes that are commonly associated with cancer transformation include fucosylation, sialylation, branching, and polylactosaminylation.Lectins are glycan-binding proteins that bind with great specificity to different glycan moieties. Lectin-based strategies to enrich or fractionate glycoproteins are being extensively used and hold promise in targeted analysis for cancer biomarker discovery. Here we describe the use of lectin chromatography to separate prostate specific antigen (PSA) glycoforms based on their sialic acid linkage from sera of patients with prostate cancer (with PSA levels in the range of 2-20 ng/mL). In particular, agarose-bound Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA) lectin which has affinity for terminal α2,6-sialic acids on glycoproteins was used. The protocol included first a previous immunoaffinity step to enrich PSA and to avoid interferences of the most abundant serum glycoproteins. Then, the immunopurified PSA was loaded on the SNA chromatography and two fractions were obtained, the first one (unbound fraction) containing the PSA glycoforms without α2,6-sialic acid (basically α2,3-sialylated PSA glycoforms) and the second one (bound fraction) the α2,6-sialylated PSA glycoforms. The quantification of the PSA eluted in the two fractions allows for the determination of the relative content of both groups of PSA glycoforms. The percentage of the α2,6-sialylated PSA glycoforms is significantly decreased in aggressive prostate cancer compared to indolent prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia, being a promising new glycobiomarker for prostate cancer risk stratification.""","""['Esther Llop', 'Rosa Peracaula']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Methods Mol Biol""","""['Characterisation of the main PSA glycoforms in aggressive prostate cancer.', 'Improvement of Prostate Cancer Diagnosis by Detecting PSA Glycosylation-Specific Changes.', 'Carbohydrate structure and differential binding of prostate specific antigen to Maackia amurensis lectin between prostate cancer and benign prostate hypertrophy.', 'Glycosylation of prostate specific antigen and its potential diagnostic applications.', 'Lectin-Based Assay for Glycoform-Specific Detection of α2,6-sialylated Transferrin and Carcinoembryonic Antigen in Tissue and Body Fluid.']"""

How AR promotes this process is still not completely clear. Herein, we used single-cell transcriptome analysis to reconstruct the transcriptional network of AR in PCa. Our work shows AR directly regulates a set of signature genes in the ER-to-Golgi protein vesicle-mediated transport pathway. The expression of these genes is required for maximum androgen-dependent ER-to-Golgi trafficking, cell growth, and survival. Our analyses also reveal the signature genes are associated with PCa progression and prognosis. Moreover, we find inhibition of the ER-to-Golgi transport process with a small molecule enhanced antiandrogen-mediated tumor suppression of hormone-sensitive and insensitive PCa. Finally, we demonstrate AR collaborates with CREB3L2 in mediating ER-to-Golgi trafficking in PCa. In summary, our findings uncover a critical role for dysregulation of ER-to-Golgi trafficking expression and function in PCa progression, provide detailed mechanistic insights for how AR tightly controls this process, and highlight the prospect of targeting the ER-to-Golgi pathway as a therapeutic strategy for advanced PCa.""","""['Lingling Hu#', 'Xin Chen#', 'Nitin Narwade#', 'Michelle Gek Liang Lim', 'Zikai Chen', 'Chandana Tennakoon', 'Peiyong Guan', 'Un In Chan', 'Zuxianglan Zhao', 'Mokan Deng', 'Xiaoling Xu', 'Wing-Kin Sung', 'Edwin Cheung']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Independence of HIF1a and androgen signaling pathways in prostate cancer.', 'Inactivation of androgen-induced regulator ARD1 inhibits androgen receptor acetylation and prostate tumorigenesis.', 'The non-canonical mechanism of ER stress-mediated progression of prostate cancer.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Oxidative stress and androgen receptor signaling in the development and progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'p130Cas is required for androgen-dependent postnatal development regulation of submandibular glands.', 'Prognostic subtypes of thyroid cancer was constructed based on single cell and bulk-RNA sequencing data and verified its authenticity.', 'The role of CaMKK2 in Golgi-associated vesicle trafficking.', 'Antagonistic Functions of Androgen Receptor and NF-κB in Prostate Cancer-Experimental and Computational Analyses.', 'CREB3L1 and CREB3L2 control Golgi remodelling during decidualization of endometrial stromal cells.']"""

Here, we show that GLI3, a key SHH pathway effector, is transcriptionally upregulated during androgen deprivation and posttranslationally stabilized in prostate cancer cells by mutation of speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP). GLI3 is a substrate of SPOP-mediated proteasomal degradation in prostate cancer cells and prostate cancer driver mutations in SPOP abrogate GLI3 degradation. Functionally, GLI3 is necessary and sufficient for the growth and migration of androgen receptor (AR)-positive prostate cancer cells, particularly under androgen-depleted conditions. Importantly, we demonstrate that GLI3 physically interacts and functionally cooperates with AR to enrich an AR-dependent gene expression program leading to castration-resistant growth of xenografted prostate tumors. Finally, we identify an AR/GLI3 coregulated gene signature that is highly correlated with castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer and predictive of disease recurrence. Together, these findings reveal that hyperactivated GLI3 promotes castration-resistant growth of prostate cancer and provide a rationale for therapeutic targeting of GLI3 in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).

Here, we examine to what extent LMWPTP expression in tumor cells affects their interaction with platelets. We demonstrate that the gene encoding LMWPTP is overexpressed in upper gastrointestinal (GI) cancer cell as well as colorectal cancer, and subsequently employ cell line models to show that the level of this phosphatase may be further augmented in the presence of platelets. We demonstrate that tumor-platelet interaction promotes GI tumor cell proliferation. Additionally, using know-down/-out models we show that LMWPTP expression in cancer cells contributes to a more efficient interaction with platelets and drives platelet-induced proliferation.

Strikingly, miR-21 loss significantly reduced cell proliferation and suppressed the prostate tumorigenesis of Pten/Trp53 mutant mice. Mechanistically, miR-21 inactivation decreased the levels of SREBP-1, FASN, and ACC in human PCa cells through downregulation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1)-mediated transcription and induction of cellular senescence. Conversely, miR-21 overexpression increased cell proliferation and migration; as well as the levels of IRS1, SREBP-1, FASN, and ACC in human PCa cells.

This study evaluated the ability of the CCR score to prognosticate the risk of metastasis in men receiving dose-escalated radiation therapy (RT) with or without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).  Methods and materials:   This retrospective, multi-institutional cohort study included men with localized National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) intermediate-, high-, and very high-risk prostate cancer (N = 741). Patients were treated with dose-escalated RT with or without ADT. The primary outcome was time to metastasis.  Results:   The CCR score prognosticated metastasis with a hazard ratio (HR) per unit score of 2.22 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.71-2.89; P < .001). The CCR score better prognosticated metastasis than NCCN risk group (CCR, P < .001; NCCN, P = .46), CAPRA score (CCR, P = .002; CAPRA, P = .59), or CCP score (CCR, P < .001; CCP, P = .59) alone. In bivariable analyses, CCR score remained highly prognostic when accounting for ADT versus no ADT (HR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.61-2.96; P < .001), ADT duration as a continuous variable (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.59-2.79; P < .001), or ADT given at or below the recommended duration for each NCCN risk group (HR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.69-2.86; P < .001). Men with CCR scores below or above the multimodality threshold (CCR score, 2.112) had a 10-year risk of metastasis of 3.7% and 21.24%, respectively. Men with below-threshold scores receiving RT alone had a 10-year risk of metastasis of 3.7%, and for men receiving RT plus ADT, the 10-year risk of metastasis was also 3.7%.  Conclusions:   The CCR score accurately and precisely prognosticates metastasis and adds clinically actionable information relative to guideline-recommended therapies based on NCCN risk in men undergoing dose-escalated RT with or without ADT. For men with scores below the multimodality threshold, adding ADT may not significantly reduce their 10-year risk of metastasis.""","""['Jonathan Tward', 'Lauren Lenz', 'Darl D Flake II', '', 'Saradha Rajamani', 'Paul Yonover', 'Carl Olsson', 'Deepak A Kapoor', 'Constantine Mantz', 'Stanley L Liauw', 'Tatjana Antic', 'Michael Fabrizio', 'Daniel Salzstein', 'Neal Shore', 'Dan Albertson', 'Jonathan Henderson', 'Steve P Lee', 'Hiram A Gay', 'Jeff Michalski', 'Arthur Hung', 'David Raben', 'Isla Garraway', 'Michael S Lewis', 'Paul L Nguyen', 'David T Marshall', 'Michael K Brawer', 'Steven Stone', 'Todd Cohen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Erratum to: Tward, J; Lenz, L; Flake II, DD; Rajamani, S; Yonover, P; Olsson, C; Kapoor, DA; Mantz, C; Liauw, SL; Antic, T; Fabrizio, M; Salzstein, D; Shore, N; Albertson, D; Henderson, J; Lee, SP; Gay, HA; Michalski, J; Hung, A; Raben, D; Garraway, I; Lewis, MS; Nguyen, PL; Marshall, DT; Brawer, MK; Stone, S; Cohen, T.

We investigated a deep learning-based rapid multiorgan delineation method for use in CBCT-guided adaptive pancreatic radiotherapy.  Methods:   To improve the accuracy of OAR delineation, two innovative solutions have been proposed in this study. First, instead of directly segmenting organs on CBCT images, a pretrained cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (cycleGAN) was applied to generating synthetic CT images given CBCT images. Second, an advanced deep learning model called mask-scoring regional convolutional neural network (MS R-CNN) was applied on those synthetic CT to detect the positions and shapes of multiple organs simultaneously for final segmentation. The OAR contours delineated by the proposed method were validated and compared with expert-drawn contours for geometric agreement using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95), mean surface distance (MSD), and residual mean square distance (RMS).  Results:   Across eight abdominal OARs including duodenum, large bowel, small bowel, left and right kidneys, liver, spinal cord, and stomach, the geometric comparisons between automated and expert contours are as follows: 0.92 (0.89-0.97) mean DSC, 2.90 mm (1.63-4.19 mm) mean HD95, 0.89 mm (0.61-1.36 mm) mean MSD, and 1.43 mm (0.90-2.10 mm) mean RMS. Compared to the competing methods, our proposed method had significant improvements (p < 0.05) in all the metrics for all the eight organs. Once the model was trained, the contours of eight OARs can be obtained on the order of seconds.  Conclusions:   We demonstrated the feasibility of a synthetic CT-aided deep learning framework for automated delineation of multiple OARs on CBCT. The proposed method could be implemented in the setting of pancreatic adaptive radiotherapy to rapidly contour OARs with high accuracy.""","""['Xianjin Dai', 'Yang Lei', 'Jacob Wynne', 'James Janopaul-Naylor', 'Tonghe Wang', 'Justin Roper', 'Walter J Curran', 'Tian Liu', 'Pretesh Patel', 'Xiaofeng Yang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Automated delineation of head and neck organs at risk using synthetic MRI-aided mask scoring regional convolutional neural network.', 'Head-and-neck organs-at-risk auto-delineation using dual pyramid networks for CBCT-guided adaptive radiotherapy.', 'Deep-learning-based image registration and automatic segmentation of organs-at-risk in cone-beam CT scans from high-dose radiation treatment of pancreatic cancer.', 'Deep learning for segmentation in radiation therapy planning: a review.', 'Research on Segmentation Technology in Lung Cancer Radiotherapy Based on Deep Learning.', '2D medical image synthesis using transformer-based denoising diffusion probabilistic model.', 'Feasibility of a deep-learning based anatomical region labeling tool for Cone-Beam Computed Tomography scans in radiotherapy.', 'Dosimetric evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging-guided adaptive radiation therapy in pancreatic cancer by extent of re-contouring of organs-at-risk.', 'Abdomen CT multi-organ segmentation using token-based MLP-Mixer.', 'Deep learning methods for enhancing cone-beam CT image quality toward adaptive radiation therapy: A systematic review.']"""

The study group comprised 105 patients diagnosed with PAC who underwent radical prostatectomy. IHC exam was performed using anti-HOXB13 and anti-TFF3 antibodies and a scoring system that permit the separation of the cases into two subgroups, with low and high immunoexpression, respectively. The statistical analysis evaluated the relationship between the two immunomarkers and clinico-pathological parameters. The Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank Mantel-Cox test were used for assessing the prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-progression free survival. Four subgroups of PAC were defined based on the IHC overexpression and low immunoexpression of HOXB13 and TFF3. High HOXB13 and TFF3 immunoexpression was commonly identified in cases characterized by a Gleason score over 7, a G4 or G5 dominant pattern, a grade group of 3 or 4 and a preoperatory PSA serum level over 20 ng/mL. HOXB13 overexpression was also associated with pathological tumor-node-metastasis (pTNM) stage. The subgroup with both low HOXB13 and TFF3 immunoexpression had the highest PSA-progression free interval, whereas the subgroup with high HOXB13 immunoexpression and low TFF3 immunoexpression presented the lowest rate, but no statistically significant differences were registered.

In recent years, silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) detectors, characterized by excellent intrinsic time resolution and high photon-detection efficiency, have been introduced as an alternative to the classic photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), thus moving the field of PET technology forward and leading to the so-called digital PET/CT (dPET/CT). On the other side, the radiopharmaceutical 68Ga-PSMA-11, approved by the Food and Drug Administration in December 2020, proved to strongly impact prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis and management. In the study under evaluation, Alberts et al. retrospectively compared the performance of dPET/CT and PMTs-based PET/CT, namely analogue PET/CT (aPET/CT), in two cohorts, each one including 65 patients undergoing PET/CT with 68Ga-PSMA-11 for suspected recurrent PCa. The authors found that dPET/CT presented a higher detection rate of pathological lesions with respect to aPET/CT. Of note, dPET/CT's higher sensitivity results are associated with an increased true-positive rate and high inter-reader agreement.

Sustainable PA has been linked to improved health-related quality of life (QoL) in cancer patients. The time of diagnosis of PCa may offer a critical time point when patients might be more likely to consider lifestyle changes. This, in turn, may contribute to sustainable PA and its likely benefits.  Objective:   The aims of this study were to determine if a structured PA intervention introduced at the time of diagnosis can (1) lead to sustainable PA and (2) help improve psychosocial and QoL outcomes as compared with usual PA.  Interventions/methods:   This was a pilot randomized controlled trial enrolling patients with intermediate-risk PCa into either arm A (supervised 8- to 12-week physical exercise program; n = 10) or control arm B (usual PA; n = 10). Primary outcome was PA at 6 months. Secondary outcomes were QoL, psychological well-being, physical fitness, and functional outcomes postintervention. Change over time was compared using a nonparametric Wilcoxon test.  Results:   Demographic variables were the same between arms. Comparing parameters at the start and 6 months post-radical prostatectomy, PA significantly improved in arm A (self-reported Godin score 24.7 vs 42.8 units, P < .01, objective number of chair stands [14-19, P < .01]), but not in arm B. There were no significant differences between arms in QoL and psychosocial outcomes.  Conclusions:   A preoperative supervised exercise training program increases long-term PA.  Implications for practice:   Future trials should evaluate PA sustainability beyond 6 months and if this leads to improved psychosocial and QoL outcomes.""","""['Gerald B Schulz', 'Jennifer A Locke', 'Kristin L Campbell', 'Kelcey A Bland', 'Cheri L Van Patten', 'Peter C Black', 'S Larry Goldenberg', 'Ryan Flannigan']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Nurs""","""['Effect of a brief physical activity-based presentation by a former patient for men treated with radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer: a mixed methods pilot study.', 'Erratum.', 'Physical exercise for functional capacity, blood immune function, fatigue, and quality of life in high-risk prostate cancer patients during radiotherapy: a prospective, randomized clinical study.', 'Behavioral and Pharmacotherapy Weight Loss Interventions to Prevent Obesity-Related Morbidity and Mortality in Adults: An Updated Systematic Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Psychosocial interventions for men with prostate cancer: a Cochrane systematic review.', 'Reasons and predictors of non-participation in a personalized digital prehabilitation care trial for patients undergoing elective cardiothoracic surgery.']"""

Methods:   A total of 100 consecutive patients treated with PSMA-PET/CT-based salvage elective nodal radiotherapy (sENRT) for LN recurrence were retrospectively examined. Patients underwent PSMA-PET/CT scan due to biochemical persistence (bcP, 76%) or biochemical recurrence (bcR, 24%) after radical prostatectomy (RP). Biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS) defined as PSA < post-RT nadir + 0.2 ng/ml and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and uni- and multivariate analysis was performed.  Results:   Median follow-up was 37 months. Median PSA at PSMA-PET/CT was 1.7 ng/ml (range 0.1-40.1) in patients with bcP and 1.4 ng/ml (range 0.3-5.1) in patients with bcR. PSMA-PET/CT detected 1, 2, and 3 or more LN metastases in 35%, 23%, and 42%, respectively. Eighty-three percent had only pelvic, 2% had only paraaortic, and 15% had pelvic and paraaortic LN metastases. Cumulatively, a total dose converted to EQD21.5 Gy of 66 Gy (60-70 Gy) was delivered to the prostatic fossa, 70 Gy (66-72 Gy) to the local recurrence, if present, 65.1 Gy (56-66 Gy) to PET-positive lymph nodes, and 47.5 Gy (42.4-50.9 Gy) to the lymphatic pathways. Concomitant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) was administered in 83% of patients. One-, 2-, and 3-year BRFS was 80.7%, 71.6%, and 65.8%, respectively. One-, 2-, and 3-year DMFS was 91.6%, 79.1%, and 66.4%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, concomitant ADT, longer ADT duration (≥ 12 vs. < 12 months) and LN localization (pelvic vs. paraaortic) were associated with improved BRFS and concomitant ADT and lower PSA value before sRT (< 1 vs. > 1 ng/ml) with improved DMFS, respectively. No such association was seen for the number of affected lymph nodes.  Conclusions:   Overall, the present analysis shows that the so far, unmatched sensitivity and specificity of PSMA-PET/CT translates in comparably high BRFS and DMFS after PSMA-PET/CT-based sENRT for patients with PCa LN recurrence.

Materials and methods:   Radioresistant prostate carcinoma DU145 and PC-3 cells were used to study the effect of shRNA-mediated knockdown of EGFR on intrinsic radioresistance mechanisms. Semi-quantitative PCR, western blotting, growth kinetics, colony formation, transwell migration, invasion and trypan blue assays along with inhibitors erlotinib, NU7441, B02, PD98059 and LY294002 were used.  Key findings:   EGFR knock-down induced morphological alterations along with reduction in clonogenic potential and cell proliferation in DU145 cells. Migratory potential of prostate cancer cells were reduced concomitant with upregulation of epithelial marker, E-cadherin and decreased expression of mesenchymal markers, vimentin and snail. Further, EGFR knock-down decreased the expression of Rad51 and DNA-PK at mRNA as well as protein levels. Likewise, erlotinib, an EGFR inhibitor, and NU7441, a DNA-PK inhibitor increased the expression of E-cadherin and decreased the level of vimentin. Both these inhibitors also decreased the levels of DNA damage regulatory protein Rad51. Further, Rad51 inhibitor, B02, inhibited the clonogenic potential, cell migration and reduced the expression of vimentin, Ku70 and Ku80, and also, B02 radiosensitized DU145 cells. EGFR-regulated expression of Rad51 was found to be mediated via PI3K/Akt and Erk1/2 pathways.  Significance:   EGFR was found to regulate DNA damage repair, survival and EMT responses in prostate cancer cells through transcriptional regulation of Rad51. A novel role of EGFR-Erk1/2/Akt-Rad51 axis through modulation of EMT and DNA repair pathways in prostate cancer resistance mechanisms is suggested.""","""['Mohit Rajput', 'Ragini Singh', 'Navneendra Singh', 'Rana P Singh']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Life Sci""","""['Down-regulation of E-cadherin enhances prostate cancer chemoresistance via Notch signaling.', 'CX3CL1 increases invasiveness and metastasis by promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition through the TACE/TGF-α/EGFR pathway in hypoxic androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Silibinin Radiosensitizes EGF Receptor-knockdown Prostate Cancer Cells by Attenuating DNA Repair Pathways.', 'Quercetin reverses EGF-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition and invasiveness in prostate cancer (PC-3) cell line via EGFR/PI3K/Akt pathway.', 'DNA-PKc inhibition overcomes taxane resistance by promoting taxane-induced DNA damage in prostate cancer cells.', 'Identification of key enzalutamide-resistance-related genes in castration-resistant prostate cancer and verification of RAD51 functions.', 'Reprogramming of palmitic acid induced by dephosphorylation of ACOX1 promotes β-catenin palmitoylation to drive colorectal cancer progression.', 'PELI1 and EGFR cooperate to promote breast cancer metastasis.', 'Combined PARP inhibitors and small molecular inhibitors in solid tumor treatment (Review).', 'Targeting PI3K/Akt signaling in prostate cancer therapy.']"""

We report in this article our early experience.  Methods:   Data related to patients treated on the MRIdian® (Viewray®) were prospectively collected. Procedures concerning the implementation of the system and internal organizational issues were summarized.  Results:   Between February 2019 and March 2020, 201 patients were treated: 40% of treatments were normofractionated (n=70) and 60% used hypofractionation (n=105). The reported monthly occupancy rate at one, six and twelve months was 30%, 62%, and 90%. The distribution of normofractionated treatments was dominated by prostatic (29%) and pancreatic (26%) cancers, followed by abdomino-pelvic irradiations for gynecological cancers (12%) or lymph node diseases (12%) and boosts for rectal or vaginal cancers (11%). Regarding treatments with moderate hypofractionation (dose by fraction between 3 and 5Gy), they corresponded mainly to integrated boost for abdomino-pelvic lymph nodes (38%), while the stereotaxic treatments primarily concerned hepatic lesions (15%), bones (30%).  Discussion:   The MRIdian® was initially used widely in our service corresponding to a learning curve for MRI guidance. This new tool for image-guided radiotherapy helped us to secure our practice providing solutions for both inter and intra-fraction movements making it possible to reduce the additional margin in order to better protect the organs at risk.

Nevertheless, a clear disconnect exists between its mRNA and protein levels, indicating that its post-translational regulation may be critical in maintaining its protein levels. Similarly, AURKA is vastly overexpressed in all stages of prostate cancer (PCa), including castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) and neuroendocrine PCa (NEPC), although its transcripts are only increased in ~ 15% of cases, hinting at additional mechanisms of deregulation. Thus, identifying the upstream regulators that control AURKA and NKX3.1's levels and/or their downstream effectors offer an alternative route to inhibit AURKA and upregulate NKX3.1 in highly fatal CRPC and NEPC. AURKA and NKX3.1 have not linked to each other in any study to date.  Methods:   A chemical genetic screen revealed NKX3.1 as a direct target of AURKA. AURKA-NKX3.1 cross-talk was analyzed using several biochemical techniques in CRPC and NEPC cells.  Results:   We uncovered a reciprocal loop between AURKA and NKX3.1 in CRPC and NEPC cells. We observed that AURKA-mediated NKX3.1 downregulation is a major mechanism that drives CRPC pathogenesis and NEPC differentiation. AURKA phosphorylates NKX3.1 at three sites, which degrades it, but AURKA does not regulate NKX3.1 mRNA levels. NKX3.1 degradation drives highly aggressive oncogenic phenotypes in cells. NKX3.1 also degrades AURKA in a feedback loop. NKX3.1-AURKA loop thus upregulates AKT, ARv7 and Androgen Receptor (AR)-signaling in tandem promoting highly malignant phenotypes. Just as importantly, we observed that NKX3.1 overexpression fully abolished synaptophysin and enolase expression in NEPC cells, uncovering a strong negative relationship between NKX3.1 and neuroendocrine phenotypes, which was further confirmed be measuring neurite outgrowth. While WT-NKX3.1 inhibited neuronal differentiation, 3A-NKX3.1 expression obliterated it.  Conclusions:   NKX3.1 loss could be a major mechanism causing AURKA upregulation in CRPC and NEPC and vice versa. NKX3.1 genomic loss requires gene therapy, nonetheless, targeting AURKA provides a powerful tool to maintain NKX3.1 levels. Conversely, when NKX3.1 upregulation strategy using small molecules comes to fruition, AURKA inhibition should work synergistically due to the reciprocal loop in these highly aggressive incurable diseases.""","""['Moloud Aflaki Sooreshjani#', 'Mohini Kamra#', 'Amina Zoubeidi', 'Kavita Shah']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Biomed Sci""","""['MUC1-C regulates lineage plasticity driving progression to neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'LIMK2-NKX3.1 Engagement Promotes Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Molecular Interplay between AURKA and SPOP Dictates CRPC Pathogenesis via Androgen Receptor.', 'Role of MicroRNAs in Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'Molecular model for neuroendocrine prostate cancer progression.']"""

In contrast, decreased cytotoxic effects against non-neoplastic blood cells, chondrocytes, and fibroblasts were observed. However, the actual FX-9 molecular mode of action is currently not fully understood.  Methods:   In this study, microarray gene expression analysis comparing FX-9 exposed and unexposed prostate cancer cells (PC-3 representing castration-resistant prostate cancer), followed by pathway analysis and gene annotation to functional processes were performed. Immunocytochemistry staining was performed with selected targets.  Results:   Expression analysis revealed 0.83% of 21,448 differential expressed genes (DEGs) after 6-h exposure of FX-9 and 0.68% DEGs after 12-h exposure thereof. Functional annotation showed that FX-9 primarily caused an activation of inflammatory response by non-canonical nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling. The 6-h samples showed activation of the cell cycle inhibitor CDKN1A which might be involved in the secondary response in 12-h samples. This secondary response predominantly consisted of cell cycle-related changes, with further activation of CDKN1A and inhibition of the transcription factor E2F1, including downstream target genes, resulting in G1-phase arrest. Matching our previous observations on cellular level senescence signaling pathways were also found enriched. To verify these results immunocytochemical staining of p21 Waf1/Cip1 (CDKN1A), E2F1 (E2F1), PAI-1 (SERPNE1), and NFkB2/NFkB p 100 (NFKB2) was performed. Increased expression of p21 Waf1/Cip1 and NFkB2/NFkB p 100 after 24-h exposure to FX-9 was shown. E2F1 and PAI-1 showed no increased expression.

Delineated prostate organs at risk (OAR), support- and target structures (gross tumor volume [GTV]/clinical target volume [CTV]/planning target volume [PTV]), along with or without separate vesicles and/or lymph nodes, were extracted as binary masks from 1854 patients. An image modality independent 2D InceptionResNetV2 classification network was trained with varying amounts of training data using four image input channels. Channel 1-3 consisted of orthogonal 2D projections from each individual binary structure. The fourth channel contained a summation of the other available binary structure masks. Structure classification performance was assessed in independent CT (n = 200 pat) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (n = 40 pat) test datasets and an external CT (n = 99 pat) dataset from another clinic. A weighted classification accuracy of 99.4% was achieved during training. The unweighted classification accuracy and the weighted average F1 score among different structures in the CT test dataset were 98.8% and 98.4% and 98.6% and 98.5% for the MRI test dataset, respectively. The external CT dataset yielded the corresponding results 98.4% and 98.7% when analyzed for trained structures only, and results from the full dataset yielded 79.6% and 75.2%. Most misclassifications in the external CT dataset occurred due to multiple CTVs and PTVs being fused together, which was not included in the training data. Our proposed DL-based method for automated renaming and standardization of prostate radiotherapy annotations shows great potential. Clinic specific contouring standards however need to be represented in the training data for successful use.

We examined the incidence and severity of feeling depressed and lack of energy in patients in a population based PCa registry.  Methods:   We included men diagnosed with PCa between 2015 and 2019 in Victoria, Australia, and enrolled in the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Registry. The primary outcome measures were responses to two questions on the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26) patient reported instrument: problems with feeling depressed and problems with lack of energy 12 months following treatment. We evaluated associations between these and age, cancer risk category, treatment type, and urinary, bowel, and sexual function.  Results:   Both outcome questions were answered by 9712 out of 12,628 (77%) men. 981 patients (10%) reported at least moderate problems with feeling depressed; 1563 (16%) had at least moderate problems with lack of energy and 586 (6.0%) with both. Younger men reported feeling depressed more frequently than older men. Lack of energy was more common for treatments that included androgen deprivation therapy than not (moderate/big problems: 31% vs. 13%), irrespective of disease risk category. Both outcomes were associated with poorer urinary, bowel, and sexual functional domain scores.  Conclusions:   Self-reported depressive feelings and lack of energy were frequent in this population-based registry. Problems with feeling depressed were more common in younger men and lack of energy more common in men having hormonal treatment.

Not all healthcare systems have universal access to prostate MRI. We investigated whether transperineal (TP) prostate biopsies provide more accurate Gleason grading than transrectal (TR) biopsies in MRI-naïve patients.  Methods:   Consecutive patients undergoing TP and TR systematic prostate needle biopsies from 2011 to 2018 were analysed. Patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) within 180 days of biopsies were included. Patients undergoing MRI prior to biopsies were excluded. Pathological concordance, incidence of Gleason upgrading, and correlation coefficients among biopsies and RP Gleason grade were compared. A sub-analysis for concordance in anterior prostate tumours was conducted.  Results:   262 patients were included (112 TP; 150 TR), the median age was 63 years, and median time from biopsy to RP was 68 days. Concordance with RP histology for TP was 65% compared to 49% for TR (p = 0.011). Biopsy technique predicted RP concordance independent of the number of cores. Gleason upgrading occurred following 24% of TP versus 33% of TR biopsies. In anterior and apical tumours, upgrading occurred in 19% of TP biopsies and 38% of TR biopsies (p = 0.027).  Conclusion:   This study suggests TP approach to prostate biopsies result in improved histological grade accuracy in men whom MRI is not available, even after controlling for number of cores.

Prediction of absorbed dose based on this pre-treatment scan could improve patient selection and help to individualize treatment by maximizing the absorbed dose to target lesions while adhering to the threshold doses for the organs at risk (kidneys, salivary glands, and liver).  Methods:   Ten patients with low-volume hormone-sensitive prostate cancer received a pre-therapeutic [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, followed by 3 GBq [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 therapy. Intra-therapeutically, SPECT/CT was acquired at 1, 24, 48, 72, and 168 h. Absorbed dose in organs and lesions (n = 22) was determined according to the MIRD scheme. Absorbed dose prediction based on [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-PET/CT was performed using tracer uptake at 1 h post-injection and the mean tissue effective half-life on SPECT. Predicted PET/actual SPECT absorbed dose ratios were determined for each target volume.  Results:   PET/SPECT absorbed dose ratio was 1.01 ± 0.21, 1.10 ± 0.15, 1.20 ± 0.34, and 1.11 ± 0.29 for kidneys (using a 2.2 scaling factor), liver, submandibular, and parotid glands, respectively. While a large inter-patient variation in lesion kinetics was observed, PET/SPECT absorbed dose ratio was 1.3 ± 0.7 (range: 0.4-2.7, correlation coefficient r = 0.69, p < 0.01).  Conclusion:   A single time point [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-PET scan can be used to predict the absorbed dose of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA therapy to organs, and (to a limited extent) to lesions.

Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective cohort study of commercial insurance claims for prostate MRI and genomic testing included 65 530 patients 40 to 89 years of age newly diagnosed with prostate cancer from July 1, 2012, through June 30, 2019.  Exposures:   Patient- and regional-level use of prostate MRI and genomic testing.  Main outcomes and measures:   Observation vs definitive treatment for prostate cancer. Patient-level analyses examined the association between receipt of testing or residing in a hospital referral region (HRR) that adopted testing and observation. In regional-level analyses, the dependent variable was the change in the proportion of patients observed for prostate cancer at the HRR level between 2 periods: July 1, 2012, to June 30, 2014, and July 1, 2017, to June 20, 2019. The independent study variables included HRR-level changes in the proportion of men undergoing prostate MRI and genomic testing between these periods, and the models were adjusted for contextual factors associated with prostate cancer care and socioeconomic status.  Results:   This study identified 65 530 patients, including 27 679 in the early period (mean [SD] age, 58.0 [5.9] years) and 37 851 in the late period (mean [SD] age, 59.0 [5.7] years). Use of prostate MRI increased significantly from 7.2% (95% CI, 6.9%-7.5%) to 16.7% (95% CI, 16.3%-17.1%) from the early to late period. Use of genomic testing increased significantly from 1.3% (95% CI, 1.1%-1.4%) to 12.7% (95% CI, 12.3%-13.0%) from the early to late period.

Therefore, a large variation in the quality of dose distribution is usually observed. To reduce variation, an automatic optimizing toolkit was developed for the Monaco treatment planning system (Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden) for prostate cancer using volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT). This toolkit was able to create plans automatically. However, most plans needed two arcs per treatment to ensure the dose coverage for targets. For prostate cancer, providing a plan with a single arc was advisable in clinical practice because intrafraction motion management must be considered to irradiate accurately. The purpose of this work was to develop an automatic treatment planning system with a single arc per treatment for prostate cancer using VMAT. We designed the new algorithm for the automatic treatment planning system to use one arc per treatment for prostate cancer in Monaco. We constructed the system in two main steps: (1) Determine suitable cost function parameters for each case before optimization, and (2) repeat the calculation and optimization until the conditions for dose indices are fulfilled. To evaluate clinical suitability, the plan quality between manual planning and the automatic planning system was compared. Our system created the plans automatically in all patients within a few iterations. Statistical differences between the plans were not observed for the target and organ at risk. It created the plans with no human input other than the initial template setting and system initiation. This system offers improved efficiency in running the treatment planning system and human resources while ensuring high-quality outputs.""","""['Takumi Kodama', 'Shigehiro Kudo', 'Shogo Hatanaka', 'Masatsugu Hariu', 'Munefumi Shimbo', 'Takeo Takahashi']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Automated volumetric modulated arc therapy planning for whole pelvic prostate radiotherapy.', 'Efficiency of biological versus physical optimization for single-arc VMAT for prostate and head and neck cases.', 'A treatment planning study comparing Elekta VMAT and fixed field IMRT using the varian treatment planning system eclipse.', 'Comprehensive Comparison of Progressive Optimization Algorithm Based Automatic Plan and Manually Planned Treatment Technique for Cervical-Thoracic Esophageal Cancers.', 'Automatizing a nonscripting TPS for optimizing clinical workflow and reoptimizing IMRT/VMAT plans.']"""

Furthermore, we have reported in a proteomic analysis that αvβ6 integrin down-regulation increases the expression of IFIT3 (interferon induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3) in PrCa cells and their derived sEVs. IFIT3 is a protein well known for being an antiviral effector, but recently its role in cancer has also been elucidated. To study the relationship between IFIT3 and STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1), an upstream regulator of IFIT3, in PrCa cells and their released sEVs, we used CRISPR/Cas9 techniques to down-regulate the expression of the β6 integrin subunit, IFIT3 or STAT1. Our results show that IFIT3 and STAT1 are highly expressed in PrCa cells devoid of the β6 integrin subunit. However, IFIT3 but not STAT1, is present in sEVs derived from PrCa cells lacking the β6 integrin subunit. We demonstrate that loss of IFIT3 generates sEVs enriched in STAT1 but reduces the levels of STAT1 in the cells. As expected, IFIT3 is not detectable in STAT1 negative cells or sEVs. We thus propose that the observed STAT1 enrichment in sEVs is a compensatory mechanism for the loss of IFIT3. Overall, these results provide new insights into the intrinsic role of IFIT3 as a regulator of STAT1 expression in sEVs and in intercellular communication in PrCa.""","""['Nicole M Naranjo', 'Israa Salem', 'Maisha A Harris', 'Lucia R Languino']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Biochem J""","""['Small extracellular vesicle-mediated ITGB6 siRNA delivery downregulates the αVβ6 integrin and inhibits adhesion and migration of recipient prostate cancer cells.', 'The αvβ6 integrin in cancer cell-derived small extracellular vesicles enhances angiogenesis.', 'Overexpression of IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3 (IFIT3) in pancreatic cancer: cellular ""pseudoinflammation"" contributing to an aggressive phenotype.', 'Small Extracellular Vesicles: Key Forces Mediating the Development and Metastasis of Colorectal Cancer.', 'The roles of small extracellular vesicles in cancer and immune regulation and translational potential in cancer therapy.', ""Genome-wide identification of murine interferon genes in microglial-mediated neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease."", 'Small extracellular vesicle-mediated ITGB6 siRNA delivery downregulates the αVβ6 integrin and inhibits adhesion and migration of recipient prostate cancer cells.']"""

DD was a significant risk factor for PCa (OR: 1.27 CI: 1.19-1.34, p < 0.01). On subgroup analysis, the patients diagnosed with DD <50 years old had an OR of 3.39 for PCa (CI: 2.52-4.56, p < 0.01), age 50-59 had an OR of 2.12 (CI: 1.86-2.15, p < 0.01), and age 60-69 had an OR of 1.20 (CI: 1.10-1.31, p < 0.01). Finally, age and race stratification showed that white patients <50 had an OR of 2.56 (CI: 1.75-3.76, p < 0.01), while black patients <50 had an OR of 3.98 (CI: 2.61-6.07, p < 0.01). The trend in differing odds between these populations was the same for age groups 50-59 and 60-69.  Conclusion:   Our analysis shows that DD is associated with diagnosis of PCa in hypertensive men. Importantly, the earlier the diagnosis of DD, the higher the odds for development of PCa, particularly in black men.""","""['Nir Tomer', 'Dimple Chakravarty', 'Parita Ratnani', 'Nihal E Mohamed', 'Ivan Jambor', 'Zachary Dovey', 'Michael A Palese', 'Ashutosh K Tewari']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Prostate Cancer Outcomes in the Veterans Affairs Health Care System.', 'Baseline prostate inflammation is associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer in men undergoing repeat prostate biopsy: results from the REDUCE study.', 'Smoking and prostate cancer in a multi-ethnic cohort.', 'Prostate Cancer Racial Disparities: A Systematic Review by the Prostate Cancer Foundation Panel.', 'The association between inflammatory bowel disease and prostate cancer risk: a meta-analysis.', 'Cancer risk in patients with diverticular disease: A nationwide cohort study.']"""

The objective of this protocol-specified subgroup analysis of STRIVE was to investigate the benefit of enzalutamide versus bicalutamide specifically in patients with nmCRPC.  Methods:   Patients (N = 139) were stratified by disease stage and randomized to enzalutamide 160 mg/day plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT; n = 70) or bicalutamide 50 mg/day plus ADT (n = 69).  Results:   Baseline characteristics of patients with nmCRPC were comparable between groups. At a median of 17 months follow-up, enzalutamide reduced the risk of progression or death by 76% versus bicalutamide in patients with nmCRPC (hazard ratio [HR], 0.24; 95% CI 0.14-0.42). Enzalutamide reduced risk of prostate-specific antigen progression by 82% versus bicalutamide in patients with nmCRPC (HR, 0.18; 95% CI 0.10-0.34). The most frequently reported adverse events by patients receiving enzalutamide were fatigue (36.2%), hot flush (20.3%), decreased appetite (17.4%), dizziness (17.4%), and nausea (17.4%).

Extensive studies reveal that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are abnormally expressed and act as key regulators in various cancers, including breast cancer. In this work, we investigated the role and regulatory mechanism of lncRNA prostate cancer-associated transcript 6 (PCAT6) in breast cancer progression. Our findings revealed that PCAT6 was overexpressed in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. Furthermore, elevation of PCAT6 reflected an adverse prognosis of patients. Functional experiments indicated that PCAT6 knockdown hampered cell proliferation, facilitated apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in vitro, and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. We also found that the transcription factor SP1 could bind to the PCAT6 promoter and promoted its expression. Subsequently, it was verified that PCAT6 was a molecular sponge for microRNA-326 (miR-326), and the leucine-rich repeat containing the eight family member E (LRRC8E) was a direct target of miR-326. Rescue assays revealed that LRRC8E overexpression attenuated the suppressive effect of PCAT6 knockdown on cellular progression of breast cancer.

While immunohistochemistry-based assays are routinely used to assess PD-L1 expression, their clinical utility remains controversial due to the partial predictive value and lack of standardized cut-offs across antibody clones. Using a high throughput immunoassay, the reverse phase protein microarray (RPPA), coupled with a fluorescence-based detection system, this study compared the performance of six anti-PD-L1 antibody clones on 666 tumor samples.  Methods:   PD-L1 expression was measured using five antibody clones (22C3, 28-8, CAL10, E1L3N and SP142) and the therapeutic antibody atezolizumab on 222 lung, 71 ovarian, 52 prostate and 267 breast cancers, and 54 metastatic lesions. To capture clinically relevant variables, our cohort included frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, surgical specimens and core needle biopsies. Pure tumor epithelia were isolated using laser capture microdissection from 602 samples. Correlation coefficients were calculated to assess concordance between antibody clones. For two independent cohorts of patients with lung cancer treated with nivolumab, RPPA-based PD-L1 measurements were examined along with response to treatment.  Results:   Median-center PD-L1 dynamic ranged from 0.01 to 39.37 across antibody clones. Correlation coefficients between the six antibody clones were heterogeneous (range: -0.48 to 0.95) and below 0.50 in 61% of the comparisons. In nivolumab-treated patients, RPPA-based measurement identified a subgroup of tumors, where low PD-L1 expression equated to lack of response.  Conclusions:   Continuous RPPA-based measurements capture a broad dynamic range of PD-L1 expression in human specimens and heterogeneous concordance levels between antibody clones. This high throughput immunoassay can potentially identify subgroups of tumors in which low expression of PD-L1 equates to lack of response to treatment.""","""['Elisa Baldelli', 'K Alex Hodge', 'Guido Bellezza', 'Neil J Shah', 'Guido Gambara', 'Angelo Sidoni', 'Martina Mandarano', 'Chamodya Ruhunusiri', 'Bryant Dunetz', 'Maysa Abu-Khalaf', 'Julia Wulfkuhle', 'Rosa I Gallagher', 'Lance Liotta', 'Johann de Bono', 'Niven Mehra', 'Ruth Riisnaes', 'Antonella Ravaggi', 'Franco Odicino', 'Maria Isabella Sereni', 'Matthew Blackburn', 'Angela Zupa', 'Giuseppina Improta', 'Perry Demsko', ""Lucio Crino'"", 'Vienna Ludovini', 'Giuseppe Giaccone', 'Emanuel F Petricoin', 'Mariaelena Pierobon']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Immunother Cancer""","""['Comparison of Different Antibody Clones for Immunohistochemistry Detection of Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) on Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma.', 'PD-L1 expression and the prognostic significance in gastric cancer: a retrospective comparison of three PD-L1 antibody clones (SP142, 28-8 and E1L3N).', 'A Prospective, Multi-institutional, Pathologist-Based Assessment of 4 Immunohistochemistry Assays for PD-L1 Expression in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Programmed Death-Ligand 1 Immunohistochemistry Testing: A Review of Analytical Assays and Clinical Implementation in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.', 'PD-L1 diagnostic tests: a systematic literature review of scoring algorithms and test-validation metrics.', 'AKT/mTOR signaling modulates resistance to endocrine therapy and CDK4/6 inhibition in metastatic breast cancers.', 'Genetically manipulating endogenous Kras levels and oncogenic mutations in vivo influences tissue patterning of murine tumorigenesis.', 'Analysis of neuroendocrine clones in NSCLCs using an immuno-guided laser-capture microdissection-based approach.', 'From rough to precise: PD-L1 evaluation for predicting the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockades.']"""

Materials and methods:   In the 2004-2016 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database, we identified 2663 UCUB patients aged 75-79 (1808 RC vs 855 RT) and 3569 UCUB patients aged 80-89 (1551 RC vs 2018 RT). After stratification for concomitant chemotherapy, propensity score matching (PSM) between RC and RT was applied and competing-risks regression models addressed CSM and OCM.  Results:   In the cohort aged 75-79, five-year CSM rates were 22.0 vs 49.0% for RC only vs RT only and yielded a HR of 0.41 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30-0.57, p<0.001) favoring RC only.

Thus, being able to predict which cancer will progress to biochemical recurrence is a great strategy to stratify prostate cancer patients. With that in mind, we created a mathematical formula that takes into account the patients clinical and pathological data resulting in a quantitative variable, called PSA density of the lesion, which has the potential to predict biochemical recurrence. To test if our variable is able to predict biochemical recurrence, we use a cohort of 219 prostate cancer patients, associating our new variable and classic parameters of prostate cancer with biochemical recurrence. Total PSA, lesion weight, volume and classic PSA density were positively associated with biochemical recurrence (p<0.05). ISUP score was also associated with biochemical recurrence in both biopsy and surgical specimen (p<0.001). The increase of PSA density of the lesion was significantly associated with the biochemical recurrence (p=0.03). Variables derived from the formula, PSA 15% and PSA 152, were also positive associated with the biochemical recurrence (p=0.01 and p=0.002 respectively). Logistic regression analysis shows that classic PSA density, PSA density of the lesion and total PSA, together, can explain up to 13% of cases of biochemical recurrence. PSA density of the lesion alone would have the ability to explain up to 7% of cases of biochemical recurrence. In conclusion, this new mathematical approach could be a useful tool to predict disease recurrence in prostate cancer.""","""['Pedro Henrique Rezende Junqueira', 'Gabriel Arantes Dos Santos', 'Marcelo Xavier', 'Poliana Romão', 'Sabrina Reis', 'Miguel Srougi', 'Willian Carlos Nahas', 'Carlo Carmargo Passerotti']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Rev Col Bras Cir""","""['Improved risk stratification for biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy using a novel risk group system based on prostate specific antigen density and biopsy Gleason score.', 'Comparison of preoperative prostate specific antigen density and prostate specific antigen for predicting recurrence after radical prostatectomy: results from the search data base.', 'Is prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density better than the preoperative PSA level in predicting early biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy?', 'Percent of prostate needle biopsy cores with cancer is significant independent predictor of prostate specific antigen recurrence following radical prostatectomy: results from SEARCH database.', 'Diagnostic methodology for the biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.']"""

This approach is simple to use but oversimplifies complex underlying processes and is cumbersome for non-homogeneous dose prescriptions. In this work, we characterize the performance of a novel probabilistic target definition and planning (PTP) approach, which uses voxel-level tumor likelihood information in treatment plan optimization.Methods.We expanded a treatment planning system with probabilistic therapy planning functionality that utilizes non-binary target maps (TM) as voxel-level input to dose plan optimization. Different dose plans were calculated and compared for twelve prostate cancer patients with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging derived TMs. Dose plans were created using both classical and PTP approaches for uniform and integrated dose boost prescriptions. Dose performance between the different approaches was compared using dose benchmarks on target and organ-at-risk (OAR) volumes.Results.Over all dose metrics, PTP was shown to be comparable to classical planning. For plans of uniform dose prescription, the PTP approach created plans within 1 Gy of the classical planning approach across all dose metrics, with no significant differences (p > 0.2). For plans with the integrated dose boost, PTP plans exhibited higher dose heterogeneity, but still showed target doses comparable to the classical approach, without increasing doses to OAR.Conclusion.In this work we introduce direct incorporation of probabilistic target definition into treatment planning. This treatment planning approach can produce both uniform dose plans and plans with integrated dose boosts that are comparable to ones created using classical dose planning. PTP is a flexible way to optimize external beam radiotherapy, as it is not limited by the use of margins. PTP can produce dose plans equivalent to classical planning, while also allows for greater versatility in dose prescription and direct incorporation of patient target definition uncertainty into treatment planning.""","""['Peter Ferjančič', 'Uulke A van der Heide', 'Cynthia Ménard', 'Robert Jeraj']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Voxel-level biological optimisation of prostate IMRT using patient-specific tumour location and clonogen density derived from mpMRI.', 'Comparisons of treatment optimization directly incorporating random patient setup uncertainty with a margin-based approach.', 'Coverage optimized planning: probabilistic treatment planning based on dose coverage histogram criteria.', 'Target miss using PTV-based IMRT compared to robust optimization via coverage probability concept in prostate cancer.', 'The Promise of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Radiation Oncology Practice in the Management of Brain, Prostate, and GI Malignancies.']"""

Different PSMA-analogues labeled with [68Ga]gallium have been investigated, showing excellent imaging properties; however, only small amounts can be produced for each radiolabeling. Recently, a [18F]fluoride labeled PSMA-inhibitor, [18F]PSMA-1007, has been introduced, and it has ensured large-scale productions, overcoming this limitation of [68Ga]PSMAs. In this study, PSMA-1007 has been labeled with low (A), medium (B) and high (C) starting activities of [18F]fluoride, in order to verify if radiochemical yield, radiochemical purity and stability of [18F]PSMA-1007 were affected. These parameters have been measured in sixty-five consecutive batches. In addition, the estimation of [18F]PSMA-1007 production costs is provided.  Results:   The radiochemical yield for low and medium activities of [18F]fluoride was 52%, while for the high one it decreased to 40%. The radiochemical purity was 99% for all three activities. [18F]PSMA-1007 did not show radiolysis up to 8 h after the end of synthesis, confirming that the radiopharmaceutical is stable and suitable to perform diagnostic studies in humans for a long period of time after the end of radiolabeling. Furthermore, radiochemical stability was demonstrated in fetal bovine serum at 4 °C and 37 °C for 120'.  Conclusions:   A starting activity of [18F]fluoride of 90 GBq (B) seems to be the best option enabling a final amount of about of 50 GBq of [18F]PSMA-1007, which is promising as it allows to: (a) perform a large number of scans, and/or (b) supply the radiopharmaceutical to any peripheral diagnostic centers in need.""","""['Costantina Maisto', 'Anna Morisco', 'Roberta de Marino', 'Elisabetta Squame', 'Valentina Porfidia', ""Laura D'Ambrosio"", 'Daria Di Martino', 'Paolo Gaballo', 'Michela Aurilio', 'Monica Buonanno', 'Aureliana Esposito', 'Marco Raddi', 'Secondo Lastoria']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""EJNMMI Radiopharm Chem""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Automated synthesis of 18FGa-rhPSMA-7/ -7.3: results, quality control and experience from more than 200 routine productions.', 'Radiohybrid Ligands: A Novel Tracer Concept Exemplified by 18F- or 68Ga-Labeled rhPSMA Inhibitors.', '18F-Labeled, PSMA-Targeted Radiotracers: Leveraging the Advantages of Radiofluorination for Prostate Cancer Molecular Imaging.', 'Nuclear Medicine in Prostate Cancer: A New Era for Radiotracers.', 'Preclinical Evaluation of a Companion Diagnostic Radiopharmaceutical, 18FPSMA-1007, in a Subcutaneous Prostate Cancer Xenograft Mouse Model.', 'Analysis of Pros and Cons in Using 68GaGa-PSMA-11 and 18FPSMA-1007: Production, Costs, and PET/CT Applications in Patients with Prostate Cancer.', '99TcSestamibi bioaccumulation induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells: an in vitro study.']"""

This study aimed to analyze the expression of toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) and vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) and the clinical value of the coexpression of TLR9 and VEGF-C in PCa. We retrospectively evaluated 55 patients with clinically localized, intermediate-risk, or high-risk PCa who underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) and extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) without neoadjuvant hormonal therapy at a single institution from June 2013 to December 2016. In all 55 patients, the median number of lymph nodes (LNs) resected was 23 (range: 18-31), and a total of 1269 LNs were removed, of which 78 LNs were positive. Seventeen patients had positive LNs, with a positive rate of 30.9%. In addition, the immunohistochemical results in the above patients revealed that high TLR9 expression was correlated with higher Gleason score (GS) (P = 0.049), increased LN metastasis (P = 0.004), and more perineural invasion (PNI) (P = 0.033). Moreover, VEGF-C expression was associated with GS (P = 0.040), pathological stage (pT stage) (P = 0.022), LN metastasis (P = 0.003), and PNI (P = 0.001). Furthermore, a significant positive correlation between TLR9 and VEGF-C was found (P < 0.001), and the TLR9/VEGF-C phenotype was associated with LN metastasis (P = 0.047). Collectively, we propose that TLR9 stimulation may promote LN metastasis in PCa cells through the upregulation of VEGF-C expression, thereby affecting the prognosis of PCa patients. Therefore, these markers may serve as valuable targets for the treatment of PCa.""","""['Xian-Zi Zeng', 'Zhan-Sen Huang', 'Hong-Peng Fang', 'Jie-Ying Wu', 'Qun-Xiong Huang', 'Chu-Bin Zhuang', 'Jing Zhou', 'Jin-Ming Di']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['Topography of lymph node metastases in prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and extended lymphadenectomy: results of a combined molecular and histopathologic mapping study.', 'Small-volume lymph node involvement and biochemical recurrence after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy with extended lymph node dissection in prostate cancer.', 'Differing risk of cancer death among patients with lymph node metastasis after radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection: identification of risk categories according to number of positive nodes and Gleason score.', 'Intermediate and high risk prostate cancer patients.

The present study aimed to investigate the molecular mech--anisms of lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 16 (SNHG16) in the proliferation and metastasis of PCa cells. Cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues were collected from 80 patients with PCa who did not receive any treatment. Reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR analysis was performed to detect the expression levels of SNHG16, hsa‑microRNA (miRNA/miR)‑373‑3p and transforming growth factor‑β receptor type 2 (TGF‑β‑R2), and Spearman's correlation coefficient analysis was performed to assess the correlations between these molecules. Furthermore, the effects of SNHG16 knockdown and overexpression on the biological functions of DU‑145 PCa cells and TGF‑β‑R2/SMAD signaling were analyzed. The dual‑luciferase reporter assay was performed to assess the associations between SNHG16 and miR‑373‑3p, and TGF‑β‑R2 and miR‑373‑3p, the effects of which were verified via rescue experiments. The results demonstrated that the expression levels of SNHG16 and TGF‑β‑R2 were significantly upregulated in PCa tissues, whereas miR‑373‑3p expression was significantly downregulated (P<0.001). In addition, negative correlations were observed between SNHG16 and miR‑373‑3p (rho, ‑0.631) and miR‑373‑3p and TGF‑β‑R2 (rho, ‑0.516). Overexpression of SNHG16 significantly promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of PCa cells (P<0.05), and significantly increased the protein expression levels of TGF‑β‑R2, phosphorylated (p)‑SMAD2, p‑SMAD3, c‑Myc and E2F4 (P<0.001). Notably, the results revealed that miR‑373‑3p is a target of SNHG16, and miR‑373‑3p knockdown rescued short hairpin (sh)‑SNHG16‑suppressed cellular functions by promoting TGF‑β‑R2/SMAD signaling. The results also revealed that miR‑373‑3p targets TGF‑β‑R2. Notably, transfection with miR‑373‑3p inhibitor rescued sh‑TGF‑β‑R2‑suppressed cell proliferation and migration.

Our study aimed to gain insight into the proportion of very long-term (14-24 years post-diagnosis) survivors of breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers who had problems with health (HI) and life (LI) insurance.  Methods:   We used data from CAESAR (CAncEr Survivorship-A multi-Regional population-based study). Participants completed questions on change in insurance providers since cancer diagnosis, problems with requesting (additional) HI or LI, and how potential problems were resolved. We conducted logistic regression to determine factors associated with change in statutory HI.  Results:   Of the 2714 respondents, 174 (6%) reported having changed HI providers. Most switched between different statutory HI providers (86%), 9% from statutory to private, and 5% from private to statutory. Respondents who changed statutory HI providers were more likely to be prostate cancer survivors (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.01-7.68) while being ≥ 65 years at time of diagnosis (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.35-0.96) and having ≥ 2 comorbid conditions (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40-0.92) were associated with reduced odds for change. Problems in changing HI were minimal and were resolved with additional contribution. Of the 310 respondents who tried to get LI, 25 respondents reported having difficulties, of whom the majority had their request rejected.

This prospective study included 118 patients who underwent transperineal robotic assisted biopsy of the prostate. We identified a total of 58 PCa-positive PI-RADS lesions. We compared diagnostic accuracy of a target-saturation biopsy strategy to accuracy of single, two, or three randomly selected targeted biopsy cores and analysed potential clinical implications. Intralesional detection of clinically significant cancer (ISUP ≥ 2) was 78.3% for target-saturation biopsy and 39.1%, 52.2%, and 67.4% for one, two, and three targeted cores, respectively. Target-saturation biopsies led to a more accurate characterization of PCa in terms of Gleason score and reduced rates of significant cancer missed. Compared to one, two, and three targeted biopsy cores, target-saturation biopsies led to intensified staging procedures in 21.7%, 10.9, and 8.7% of patients, and ultimately to a potential change in therapy in 39.1%, 26.1%, and 10.9% of patients.

DNA methylation has been widely used as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, however, with low clinical translation rate. By taking advantage of multi-cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), we aimed to identify prostate cancer specific biomarkers which can separate between non-aggressive and aggressive prostate cancer based on DNA methylation patterns.  Results:   We performed a comparison analysis of DNA methylation status between normal prostate tissues and prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) samples at different Gleason stages. The candidate biomarkers were selected by excluding the biomarkers existing in multiple cancers (pan-cancer) and requiring significant difference between PRAD and other urinary samples. By least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) selection, 8 biomarkers (cg04633600, cg05219445, cg05796128, cg10834205, cg16736826, cg23523811, cg23881697, cg24755931) were identified and in-silico validated by model constructions. First, all 8 biomarkers could separate PRAD at different stages (Gleason 6 vs. Gleason 3 + 4: AUC = 0.63; Gleason 6 vs. Gleason 4 + 3 and 8-10: AUC = 0.87). Second, 5 biomarkers (cg04633600, cg05796128, cg23523811, cg23881697, cg24755931) effectively detected PRAD from normal prostate tissues (AUC ranged from 0.88 to 0.92).

Drug resistance and high recurrence rates impede the chemotherapeutic effect, making it urgent to develop new anti-NSCLC agents. Recently, we have demonstrated that para-toluenesulfonamide is a potential anti-tumor agent in human castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) through inhibition of Akt/mTOR/p70S6 kinase pathway and lipid raft disruption. In the current study, we further addressed the critical role of cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomain and autophagic activation to para-toluenesulfonamide action in killing NSCLC. Similar in CRPC, para-toluenesulfonamide inhibited the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway in NSCLC cell lines NCI-H460 and A549, leading to G1 arrest of the cell cycle and apoptosis. Para-toluenesulfonamide significantly decreased the cholesterol levels of plasma membrane. External cholesterol supplement rescued para-toluenesulfonamide-mediated effects. Para-toluenesulfonamide induced a profound increase of LC3-II protein expression and a significant decrease of p62 expression. Double staining of lysosomes and cellular cholesterol showed para-toluenesulfonamide-induced lysosomal transportation of cholesterol, which was validated using flow cytometric analysis of lysosome staining. Moreover, autophagy inhibitors could blunt para-toluenesulfonamide-induced effect, indicating autophagy induction. In conclusion, the data suggest that para-toluenesulfonamide is an effective anticancer agent against NSCLC through G1 checkpoint arrest and apoptotic cell death.

Several studies reported the correlation between NANOG expression and tumor metastasis, revealing itself as a powerful biomarker of poor prognosis. However, how NANOG regulates tumor progression is still not known. We previously showed in medaka fish that Nanog regulates primordial germ cell migration through Cxcr4b, a chemokine receptor known for its ability to promote migration and metastasis in human cancers. Therefore, we investigated the role of human NANOG in CXCR4-mediated cancer cell migration. Of note, we found that NANOG regulatory elements in the CXCR4 promoter are functionally conserved in medaka fish and humans, suggesting an evolutionary conserved regulatory axis. Moreover, CXCR4 expression requires NANOG in human glioblastoma cells. In addition, transwell assays demonstrated that NANOG regulates cancer cell migration through the SDF1/CXCR4 pathway.

Here, we investigated whether and how 5-hydro-5-methylimidazolone (MG-H1), a specific methylglyoxal (MG)-derived advanced glycation end product (AGE), was a novel player in the dialogue between PCa and OB to drive PCa bone metastases.

We found that PC3 cells were able to release MG-H1 that, by binding to the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) on OB, reprogrammed them into a less-differentiate phenotype, endowed with some PCa-specific molecular features and malignant properties, in a mechanism involving reactive oxidative species (ROS) production and NF-kB pathway activation.

However, the mechanisms whereby TMEPAI facilitates tumorigenesis are not fully understood. We previously established TMEPAI-knockout (KO) cells from human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines and found that TMEPAI-KO cells showed reduced tumorigenic abilities. Here, we report that TMEPAI-KO cells upregulated the expression of pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase 1 (PHLPP1) and suppressed AKT Ser473 phosphorylation, which was consistent with TCGA dataset analysis. Additionally, the knockdown (KD) of PHLPP1 in TMEPAI-KO cells partially but significantly rescued AKT Ser473 phosphorylation, as well as in vitro and in vivo tumorigenic activities, thus showing that TMEPAI functions as an oncogenic protein through the regulation of PHLPP1 subsequent to AKT activation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that TMEPAI PPxY (PY) motifs are essential for binding to NEDD4-2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and PHLPP1-downregulatory ability. Moreover, TMEPAI enhanced the complex formation of PHLPP1 with NEDD4-2 and PHLPP1 polyubiquitination, which leads to its proteasomal degradation.

MRF was obtained twice before (nonenhanced [NE] MRF) and after contrast injection (contrast-enhanced [CE] MRF), and T1 and T2 maps were generated from each MRF. Two radiologists independently drew regions of interest (ROIs) on the MRF maps and the ADC maps.

SABR is an emerging technique for prostate cancer, but its use in high-risk disease is limited. Efficacy, toxic effects, and quality of life (QoL) were compared in patients treated on 2 prospective protocols that used SABR boost or magnetic resonance-guided high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) boost with 6 to 18 months of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).  Methods and materials:   In SATURN study (study 1), patients received 40 Gy to the prostate and 25 Gy to the pelvis in 5 weekly fractions. In SPARE (study 2), patients received HDR-BT (15 Gy × 1) to the prostate and ≤22.5 Gy to the magnetic resonance imaging nodule, followed by 25 Gy in 5 weekly fractions to the pelvis. All patients received between 6 and 18 months of ADT.  Results:   Thirty patients (7% unfavorable intermediate risk and 93% high risk, per National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN] criteria) completed study 1, and 31 patients (3% favorable intermediate risk, 47% unfavorable intermediate risk, and 50% high risk) completed treatment as per study 2. The median follow-up times were 72 and 62 months, respectively. In study 2, 6 patients had biochemical failure, and all 6 developed metastatic disease. Actuarial 5-year biochemical failure was 0% for study 1 and 18.2% for study 2 (P = .005). There was no significant difference in the worst acute or late gastrointestinal or genitourinary toxicity. Grade 3 late genitourinary toxicity was noted in 3% of the patients in study 2 (HDR-BT boost). There was either no significant difference or minimal clinically important change in QoL.  Conclusions:   In the context of 5-fraction pelvic radiation therapy and ADT, there did not appear to be a significant difference in toxicity or QoL between SABR and HDR-BT boost.

Objective:   To determine whether individuals' preferences for more or less health care are associated with informed choice and understanding of overdiagnosis in routine prostate cancer screening and to examine associations among preferences, educational status, and health literacy.  Design, setting, and participants:   This survey study included a community-based sample of men in Australia aged 45 to 60 years eligible for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening, recruited via an international social research company. Survey data were collected online from June 27 to July 26, 2018. Data were analyzed in April 2020.  Exposures:   Participants were randomized to 1 of 2 versions of an online decision aid (full-length or abbreviated) about PSA screening and completed an online survey that included a measure of preference for more or less health care, the Medical Maximizer-Minimizer Scale (MMS), in which higher score indicates preference for more health care.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcome was informed choice; knowledge, attitudes, and intentions about screening for prostate cancer were also measured.  Results:   Of 3722 participants who began the survey, 2993 (80.4%) completed it (mean [SD] age, 52.15 [6.65] years). Stronger preferences for more heath care were observed in those without tertiary education (mean difference, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.09-0.22; P < .001) and with inadequate health literacy (mean difference, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.09-0.22; P < .001). After controlling for health and demographic variables, a 1-unit increase in MMS score was associated with reduced relative risk (RR) of making an informed choice (RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.74-0.82; P < .001) and of having adequate conceptual knowledge (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.84-0.90; P < .001), correct numerical knowledge (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.89-0.97; P = .001), and correct understanding of overdiagnosis (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.79-0.90; P < .001).

The pioneer factor GATA2 is a significant prostate cancer (PC) driver and is linked to poor prognosis. GATA2 directly promotes androgen receptor (AR) gene expression (both full-length and splice-variant) and facilitates AR binding to chromatin, recruitment of coregulators, and target gene transcription. Unfortunately, there is no clinically applicable GATA2 inhibitor available at the moment. Using a bioinformatics algorithm, we screened in silico 2650 clinically relevant drugs for a potential GATA2 inhibitor. Validation studies used cytotoxicity and proliferation assays, global gene expression analysis, RT-qPCR, reporter assay, reverse phase protein array analysis (RPPA), and immunoblotting. We examined target engagement via cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), ChIP-qPCR, and GATA2 DNA-binding assay. We identified the vasodilator dilazep as a potential GATA2 inhibitor and confirmed on-target activity via CETSA. Dilazep exerted anticancer activity across a broad panel of GATA2-dependent PC cell lines in vitro and in a PDX model in vivo. Dilazep inhibited GATA2 recruitment to chromatin and suppressed the cell-cycle program, transcriptional programs driven by GATA2, AR, and c-MYC, and the expression of several oncogenic drivers, including AR, c-MYC, FOXM1, CENPF, EZH2, UBE2C, and RRM2, as well as of several mediators of metastasis, DNA damage repair, and stemness.

No randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have examined the feasibility, safety, and acceptability of remote exercise training in men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Methods:   We conducted a pilot RCT (1:1:1 aerobic or resistance exercise 3x/week or usual care) to determine the feasibility, safety, and acceptability of remotely monitored exercise over 12 weeks in 25 men with mCRPC. A prescribed exercise program was based on baseline testing including high- and moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or resistance exercise completed at a local exercise facility. Feasibility was based on attendance, adherence, and tolerance; safety on adverse events; and acceptability on participant interviews.  Results:   Between March 2016 and March 2020, 25 patients were randomized (8 aerobic, 7 resistance, and 10 control). Twenty-three men (82%) completed the 12-week study. Men who completed the remote intervention attempted 90% and 96% of prescribed aerobic and resistance training sessions, respectively, and 86% and 88% of attempted sessions were completed as or more than prescribed. We observed changes in performance tests that corresponded with the exercise prescription. No safety concerns were identified. Ninety percent of participants interviewed were satisfied with the program and would recommend it to others.

Methods:   41 patients who underwent preoperative prostate MRI and MRE with a modified driver were enrolled retrospectively from May 2016 to September 2021. All were included in the assessment of MRE image quality, using a qualitative visual inspection and a quantitative confidence map. 35 patients (prostate cancer (PCa), n = 13; non-PCa, n = 22) undergoing prostatectomy or biopsy were evaluated for the diagnostic performance of stiffness values. The confidence values and the stiffness values were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and independent samples T test, respectively. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) analysis was performed.  Results:   Through the qualitative analysis, all MRE acquisitions were successful at 60, 90, 120 and 150 Hz.

Patients & methods:   A prospective randomized clinical study between January 2017 and January 2021 on 155 adult patients with chronic pelvic pain syndrome. All patients were initially evaluated with a thorough history and physical examination. Baseline symptoms evaluation of each participant was assessed using NIH-CPSI score, IPSS, VAS, and IIEF-5 score. Patients were randomized into two groups: a verum treatment group and a placebo treatment group. Patients of verum group in the lithotomy position received a perineally applied ESWT treatment once a week for four weeks with 3000 impulses each. Patients of placebo group received the same therapy head of the same device with a layer of air-filled microspheres to absorb the shock waves. The previously mentioned validated scores were reassessed on regular follow-up visits at one, three, six, and 12 months after the completion of ESWT.  Results:   A statistically significant improvement was noticed in the mean values of NIH-CPSI, IPSS, VAS, and IIEF-5 of the patients of verum group over the follow-up period with also statistically significant difference between both groups. At the first visit of follow-up after ESWT, 63 (82.8%) patients had ≥6 points decrease in the NIH-CPSI total score, while 13 (17.2%) patients did not. Univariate and multivariate analyses of the clinical characteristics between the responders and non-responders showed that those patients with history of psychological disorders or had higher initial NIH-CPSI score had a significantly lower response rate to ESWT (p = 0.005, 0.02 & p = 0.002, 0.004 respectively). ROC curve of NIH-CPSI score showed that a score of 32 was the cut-off point above which the response to ESWT decreased.  Conclusion:   ESWT is an effective treatment option for CPPS. Its efficacy remained throughout long-term follow up. High initial NIH-CPSI score and history of psychological problems are significant predictors for it.""","""['Ahmed M Sakr', 'Amr M Fawzi', 'Mostafa Kamel', 'Maged M Ali']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Non-pharmacological interventions for treating chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome.', 'Non-pharmacological interventions for treating chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome.', 'Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy Combined with Drug Therapy in Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome : A Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'Efficacy of low-intensity extracorporeal shock wave therapy for the treatment of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The Efficacy and Safety of Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy versus Acupuncture in the Management of Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome: Evidence Based on a Network Meta-analysis.', 'Treatment of prostatitis with low-intensity extracorporeal shockwave therapy (LI-ESWT).', 'Acupuncture for Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome: A GRADE-assessed Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Metabolomics Analysis Reveals the Differential Metabolites and Establishes the Therapeutic Effect Prediction Nomogram Among CP/CPPS Patients Who Respond or Do Not Respond to LiST.', 'New Frontiers of Extracorporeal Shock Wave Medicine in Urology from Bench to Clinical Studies.']"""

The point prevalence of depression was 16.9%. Contrary to their subjective perception, the respondents' knowledge about those mutations was moderate. Despite the high rate of information transfer to relatives at risk (100%), their reported uptake of genetic testing was low (45.6%). Communication about the mutation detection was more frequent with female than with male relatives. In-depth focus group interviews revealed significant barriers to accessing genetic counseling including anxiety, uncertainty about the benefits of testing and about the own cancer risk, particularly among males.

For this reason, the main aim of the study was to develop and optimize the preparation protocol for urine samples in lipidomics, using urine samples obtained from patients with diagnosed cancer and non-cancer controls. Several conditions like extraction method and types of matrices were evaluated. For this purpose, two methods for the extraction of lipids, namely modified Folch and Bligh & Dyer were employed. Furthermore, two types of matrices (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (HCCA) and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB)) for the separation of lipids into individual components was tested. The results of this study can serve as an essential source for the selection of appropriate extraction methods and the appropriate choice of a matrix for the purification and identification of a particular class of lipid in human biological fluids. Based on it, Bligh & Dyer method associated with the usage of HCCA matrix was found to be the most effective for lipidomics using MALDI-TOF/MS. The optimized method was applied to compare the lipid profile of 139 urine samples collected from both healthy individuals and patients with prostate cancer. The tandem spectroscopic analysis allowed to identify lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, and triacylglycerols in urine samples. Finally, MALDI-TOF/MS analysis enabled to discriminate between the two tested groups (healthy individuals and patients with prostate cancer).

Intracellular calcium changes are an important secondary signal, triggered by a variety of extracellular stimuli, that controls many cellular functions. One of the main events affecting calcium is androgen signaling. Indeed, via calcium changes, androgens regulate cell processes like cell growth, differentiation and motility. In the present work we explored the nature of the receptor involved in calcium response induced by membrane-acting testosterone in prostate cancer cells. We report that testosterone, independently of the presence of the classical androgen receptor, can rapidly increase intracellular calcium from calcium stores, through the oxoeicosanoid receptor 1 (OXER1) and a specific signaling cascade that triggers calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings reveal for the first time the receptor involved in the rapid calcium changes induced by androgens. Moreover, they further support the notion that androgens, even in the absence of AR, can still exert specific effects that regulate cancer cell fate.""","""['Athanasios A Panagiotopoulos', 'Konstantina Kalyvianaki', 'Bourcin Serifoglou', 'Evangelia Konstantinou', 'George Notas', 'Elias Castanas', 'Marilena Kampa']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mol Cell Endocrinol""","""['Antagonizing effects of membrane-acting androgens on the eicosanoid receptor OXER1 in prostate cancer.', 'Membrane androgen receptors (OXER1, GPRC6A AND ZIP9) in prostate and breast cancer: A comparative study of their expression.', 'Enhanced OXER1 expression is indispensable for human cancer cell migration.', 'Membrane Androgen Receptors Unrelated to Nuclear Steroid Receptors.', 'Androgens as therapy for androgen receptor-positive castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'From Traditional Ethnopharmacology to Modern Natural Drug Discovery: A Methodology Discussion and Specific Examples.']"""

The expression of ARID5A, an AT-rich interaction domain (ARID) DNA-binding motif-containing transcription factor is positively correlated with IL-6 expression in human PCa. We, therefore, hypothesized that ARID5A could regulate IL-6 expression in PCa.  Methods:   The relationship between ARID5A and IL-6 in PCa patients was analyzed using statistical analyses of multiple clinical microarray data sets. To investigate whether ARID5A regulates IL-6 expression, CRISPR-driven ARID5A knockout clones were established in DU145 and PC-3 cells.  Results:   Analysis of three microarray data sets showed a positive correlation between ARID5A and IL-6 expression. The expression of IL-6 in ARID5A knockout clones was significantly reduced compared with control clones in both PCa cell lines. Knockout of ARID5A did not result in any loss of IL-6 mRNA stability. Instead, we observed a significant decrease in the occupancy of both active RNA Polymerase II and the active histone mark, H3K4me3 at the IL-6 transcriptional start site in ARID5A knockout PCa cells, suggesting a role for transcriptional regulation.

Methods:   In 46 mCRPC patients scheduled for Lu-177-PSMA-RLT, pretherapeutic estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR [ml/min/1.73 m2 ]), Tc-99m-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (Tc-99m-MAG3) clearance and baseline Ga-68-PSMA-ligand positron emission tomography (PET)-derived renal cortical uptake and PSMA-tumor volume (TV) were determined. We tested the predictive capability of these parameters and clinical risk factors for the occurrence of CKD (defined as CTCAE vers. 5.0 grade 2 or higher) during follow-up.  Results:   After 4 ± 3 cycles of RLT average eGFR declined from 76 ± 17 to 72 ± 20 ml/min/1.73 m2 (p = 0.003). Increased estimated renal radiation dose (eRRD) was significantly associated with renal functional decline (p = 0.008). During follow-up, 16/46 (30.4%) developed CKD grade 2 (no grade 3 or higher). In receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, pretherapeutic eGFR was highly accurate in identifying the occurrence of CKD vs no CKD with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.945 (p < 0.001; best threshold, 77 ml/min/1.73 m2 ), followed by Tc-99m-MAG3-derived tubular extraction rate (TER; AUC, 0.831, p < 0.001; best threshold, 200 ml/min/1.73 m2 ). Renal PET signal (p = 0.751) and PSMA-TV (p = 0.942), however, were not predictive.

Methods:   We performed a single institution retrospective analysis of 77 mCRPC patients who were treated with 6 cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy, and who also underwent 11C-choline PET/CT scans at baseline (before chemotherapy), mid-course (after 3 cycles), and posttherapy (after 6 cycles). We evaluated treatment response based on percent change in blood pool-corrected maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of the target lesion on PET/CT, as well as percent change in serum prostate specific antigen (PSA). Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with complete treatment response. Progression free survival (PFS) analysis was performed using log-rank test and shown on Kaplan-Meier plot.  Results:   Percent change in blood pool-corrected SUVmax on mid-course scan was a significant predictor of complete response (odds ratio [OR]: 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.96-0.99, p = .0003), whereas percent change in PSA was not (OR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.99-1.01, p = .6025). 57 of 77 patients (74%) achieved ≥20% reduction in blood pool-corrected SUVmax on mid-course; these patients were 3.6 times more likely to achieve complete response after full 6 cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy, compared to patients with <20% reduction in blood pool-corrected SUVmax (OR: 3.56, 95% CI: 1.04-16.52, p = .0420).

This study explored decision-making for treatment choice among BA/BC men treated for CaP.  Methods:   Using constructivist grounded theory, face-to-face, Skype and telephone interviews were conducted with 25 Black men (8 BA, 17 BC) recruited in England between October 2016 and March 2018. Data were analysed using constant comparison until saturation was achieved.  Results:   Data analysis yielded three broad categories: 'coming to terms with the prostate cancer diagnosis', 'getting empowerment through information-seeking' and 'choosing a treatment option'. Priority for survival substantially motivated BA/BC men to take up radical treatment for their CaP. However, decision-making for a particular treatment option was a more complex process which was shaped by an intersection between biological, behavioural, medical, personal and cultural factors.  Conclusions:   Healthcare providers need to consider the complexity of decision-making process for CaP treatment among BA/BC men and tailor cancer care services to reflect cultural sensitivity and person-centredness.

However, the relationship between TLR4 and prognosis and immune cell infiltration in pan-cancer patients is still unclear. Through the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases, the distinct expression of the TLR4 gene in 24 tumors and normal tissues was analyzed. Univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to identify the cancer types whose TLR4 gene expression was related to prognosis. The relationship between TLR4 and tumor cell immune invasion was studied. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to analyze the relationship among TLR4 and immune neoantigens, tumor mutation burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), DNA repair genes, and DNA methylation. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was used to identify the tumor-related pathways that the TLR4 gene was highly expressed in; the expression of the TLR4 gene was verified with the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database. Low expression of TLR4 was associated with an inferior prognosis in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), while high expression was related to a poor prognosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), and testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT). The expression of TLR4 was negatively correlated with the expression of B cells in STAD. The expression of TLR4 was positively correlated with the infiltration of B cells, CD4 and CD8 T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells in STAD, KIRC, UCEC, TGCT, and SKCM. The expression of the TLR4 gene in KIRC, SKCM, STAD, TGCT, and UCEC was highly correlated with inducible T-cell costimulator (ICOS), cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated molecule 4 (CTLA4), and CD28 immune checkpoints. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient showed that the expression of TLR4 gene was significantly correlated with TMB in STAD and UCEC and was prominently correlated with MSI in TGCT, STAD, and SKCM. The expression of the TLR4 gene was highly correlated with MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 in KIRC, SKCM, and STAD. The expression of the TLR4 gene was remarkably correlated with the methyltransferases DNA methyltransferase 2 (DNMT2) and DNA methyltransferase 3-beta (DNMT3B) in SKCM and STAD. Enrichment analysis showed that TLR4 was highly expressed in the chemokine signaling pathway and the cell adhesion molecule and cytokine receptor interaction pathway. In summary, the expression of TLR4 is linked to the prognosis of KIRC, SKCM, STAD, TGCT, and UCEC patients and the level of immune infiltration of CD4, CD8 T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells.""","""['Jialing Hu', 'Jiasheng Xu', 'Xiaojin Feng', 'Yiran Li', 'Fuzhou Hua', 'Guohai Xu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Front Cell Dev Biol""","""['Pan-Cancer Analysis of PARP1 Alterations as Biomarkers in the Prediction of Immunotherapeutic Effects and the Association of Its Expression Levels and Immunotherapy Signatures.', 'Identification of SHCBP1 as a potential biomarker involving diagnosis, prognosis, and tumor immune microenvironment across\xa0multiple\xa0cancers.', 'Identifies microtubule-binding protein CSPP1 as a novel cancer biomarker associated with ferroptosis and tumor microenvironment.', 'The cancer driver genes IDH1/2, JARID1C/ KDM5C, and UTX/ KDM6A: crosstalk between histone demethylation and hypoxic reprogramming in cancer metabolism.', 'Good or not good: Role of miR-18a in cancer biology.', 'Pattern-recognition receptors in endometriosis: A narrative review.', 'Effects of Methadone on the Toll-like Receptor 4 Expression in Human Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma A549 Cell Line Using In-silico and In vitro Techniques.', 'ANXA2 is a potential biomarker for cancer prognosis and immune infiltration: A systematic pan-cancer analysis.', 'DHRS7 is an immune-related prognostic biomarker of KIRC and pan-cancer.', 'Development and validation of a predictive model combining clinical, radiomics, and deep transfer learning features for lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer.']"""

Among all urological cancers, prostate cancer is associated with the highest rate of bone metastases, which can greatly reduce a patient's quality of life. In recent years, cell-derived exosomes, which can contain a wide range of biologically active molecules, have been reported as a novel method of communication among individual cells. However, the specific role that exosomes serve in this disease has not been fully elucidated. The prostate cancer cell line PC-3 were applied in the present study, where its exosomes were isolated to explore their potential effects on osteoclast differentiation. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles secreted by cells. The size of exosomes is 30-150 nm. They have double membrane structure and saucer-like morphology. They contain rich contents (including nucleic acid, protein and lipid) and participate in molecular transmission between cells. The combined results of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining (to identify osteoclasts obtained from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells), reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting showed that PC-3-derived exosomes attenuated osteoclast differentiation by downregulating marker genes associated with osteoclastic maturation, including V-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog B, matrix metalloproteinase 9 and integrin β3. microRNA (miR)-148a expression was also found to be downregulated in osteoclasts by PC-3-derived exosomes.

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the socioeconomic level on prostate cancer, using data from a population-based cancer registry.  Methods:   The source of data on cases of prostate cancer between 2006 and 2010 was the Somme cancer registry (Amiens, France). Socioeconomic status was measured according to the European Deprivation Index (EDI), which was used to classify each geographical ""IRIS"" unit (the smallest sub-municipal geographical entity for which French census data are available) according to its level of social deprivation. For spatial analysis, we considered a hierarchical generalized linear model.  Results:   In the spatial analysis, prostate cancer incidence was higher in the less disadvantaged areas and treatment frequency with curative intent was lower in the most disadvantaged areas. Cancer aggressiveness and mortality were higher in the most disadvantaged areas: relative risk (RR) = 1.36; 95% CI: [1.09; 1.73] and RR=3.09 [1.70; 5.59], respectively.

Recently found in many peptides, sarcosine has been researched as a newly accepted prostate cancer marker. The increased concentration of sarcosine in blood serum and the urine showed that malignancy of measured prostate cancer cells is active.  Objective:   In this article, we aimed to design a potentiometric biosensor for detection of sarcosine with a low detection limit, high selectivity, short response time, wide linear range, and satisfactory long-term stability.  Methods:   In this article, we developed a new Graphene oxide (GFOX) photosensitive cross-linker based potentiometric biosensor based on the AmiNoAcid (monomer) Decorated and Light Underpinning Conjugation Approach (ANADOLUCA) method. The functional groups determined using Raman, FT-IR, XPS analyzes, and surface characterization, the morphology of synthesized GFOX photosensitive cross-linker were determined by TEM and AFM studies. Then, the performance of the GFOX based potentiometric biosensor has been evaluated.  Results:   When the usage of the developed GFOX doped potentiometric biosensor against sarcosine determination, it was found that 10-4 mM sarcosine was determined in 60 seconds in the solution. In addition, the detection limit of the GFOX doped potentiometric biosensor was found to be 9.45x10-7 mM, and the linear potentiometric biosensor was found to be in the concentration range of 10-1 to 10-5 mM. The selectivity studies of the developed potentiometric biosensor were investigated using glycine solutions, and it was determined that GFOX doped potentiometric biosensor was more selective against sarcosine. Besides this, a reusability test using 10-3 mM sarcosine solution showed that reproducible studies were performed without the loss of potential of designed potentiometric biosensor and no loss of sensitivity.  Conclusion:   After applying the framework, we get a new potentiometric biosensor for sarcosine determination. GFOX photosensitive cross-linker was used in designing potentiometric biosensors, and this increased the stability and efficiency of the biosensor. Therefore, the developed potentiometric biosensor for sarcosine determination could be easily used for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer.""","""['Özlem Biçen Ünlüer', 'Nazire Altunkök', 'Ebru Birlik Özkütük', 'Arzu Ersöz']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Protein Pept Lett""","""['Construction and application of amperometric sarcosine biosensor based on SOxNPs/AuE for determination of prostate cancer.', 'Potentiometric sensor fabrication having 2D sarcosine memories and analytical features.', 'Polymer-dispersed reduced graphene oxide nanosheets and Prussian blue modified biosensor for amperometric detection of sarcosine.', 'Quantitative analysis of sarcosine with special emphasis on biosensors: a review.', 'Sarcosine as a potential prostate cancer biomarker--a review.']"""

Like other viruses, SARS-CoV-2 also interacts with host proteins to pave its entry into host cells. Therefore, to understand the behaviour of SARS-CoV-2 and design of effective antiviral drugs, host-virus protein-protein interactions (PPIs) can be very useful. In this regard, we have initially created a human-SARS-CoV-2 PPI database from existing works in the literature which has resulted in 7085 unique PPIs. Subsequently, we have identified at most 10 proteins with highest degrees viz. hub proteins from interacting human proteins for individual virus protein. The identification of these hub proteins is important as they are connected to most of the other human proteins. Consequently, when they get affected, the potential diseases are triggered in the corresponding pathways, thereby leading to comorbidities. Furthermore, the biological significance of the identified hub proteins is shown using KEGG pathway and GO enrichment analysis. KEGG pathway analysis is also essential for identifying the pathways leading to comorbidities. Among others, SARS-CoV-2 proteins viz. NSP2, NSP5, Envelope and ORF10 interacting with human hub proteins like COX4I1, COX5A, COX5B, NDUFS1, CANX, HSP90AA1 and TP53 lead to comorbidities. Such comorbidities are Alzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington, HTLV-1 infection, prostate cancer and viral carcinogenesis. Subsequently, using Enrichr tool possible repurposable drugs which target the human hub proteins are reported in this paper as well. Therefore, this work provides a consolidated study for human-SARS-CoV-2 protein interactions to understand the relationship between comorbidity and hub proteins so that it may pave the way for the development of anti-viral drugs.""","""['Nimisha Ghosh', 'Indrajit Saha', 'Nikhil Sharma']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Comput Biol Med""","""['SARS-CoV-2 meta-interactome suggests disease-specific, autoimmune pathophysiologies and therapeutic targets.', 'Machine learning techniques for sequence-based prediction of viral-host interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins.', 'Computational Identification of Human Biological Processes and Protein Sequence Motifs Putatively Targeted by SARS-CoV-2 Proteins Using Protein-Protein Interaction Networks.', 'Network for network concept offers new insights into host- SARS-CoV-2 protein interactions and potential novel targets for developing antiviral drugs.', 'The current landscape of coronavirus-host protein-protein interactions.', 'Transcription Factor Driven Gene Regulation in COVID-19 Patients.', 'Interactome-Based Machine Learning Predicts Potential Therapeutics for COVID-19.', 'HuCoPIA: An Atlas of Human vs. SARS-CoV-2 Interactome and the Comparative Analysis with Other Coronaviridae Family Viruses.', 'Unveiling the Biomarkers of Cancer and COVID-19 and Their Regulations in Different Organs by Integrating RNA-Seq Expression and Protein-Protein Interactions.', 'Systemic cytokines and GlycA discriminate disease status and predict corticosteroid response in HTLV-1-associated neuroinflammation.']"""

Methods:   The levels of lncRNA FGF14-AS2, miR-96-5p, and Adherens junction-associated protein-1 (AJAP1) in prostate carcinoma were tested by Western blot and qRT-PCR. How these two genes interacted was confirmed by RNA immunoprecipitation and dualluciferase gene methods.

However, the mechanisms that regulate PTOV1 remain unclear. Here, we identify 14-3-3 as a PTOV1 interactor and show that high levels of 14-3-3 expression, like PTOV1, correlate with prostate cancer progression. We discover an SGK2-mediated phosphorylation of PTOV1 at S36, which is required for 14-3-3 binding. Disruption of the PTOV1-14-3-3 interaction results in an accumulation of PTOV1 in the nucleus and a proteasome-dependent reduction in PTOV1 protein levels. We find that loss of 14-3-3 binding leads to an increase in PTOV1 binding to the E3 ubiquitin ligase HUWE1, which promotes proteasomal degradation of PTOV1. Conversely, our data suggest that 14-3-3 stabilizes PTOV1 protein by sequestering PTOV1 in the cytosol and inhibiting its interaction with HUWE1. Finally, our data suggest that stabilization of the 14-3-3-bound form of PTOV1 promotes PTOV1-mediated expression of cJun, which drives cell-cycle progression in cancer.

For instance, several researchers have recognized melatonin suppression in humans as a direct cause of long-term exposure to high artificial light levels at night. Others have identified low melatonin levels as a risk factor for a higher prevalence of hormone-sensitive cancer. This paper analyzes the association between light pollution, estimated as the emission analysis of satellite worldwide nighttime light collections from 1999 to 2012, and 25,025 breast and 16,119 prostate cancer events from 2003 to 2012. Both types of cancer increased during the study period, but light pollution increased in urban and peri-urban areas and decreased in rural areas. Cumulative light pollution during 5 years showed a positive association with breast cancer but not with prostate cancer. The association between light pollution and breast cancer persisted when adjusted to age-standardized rates with a mean increase of 10.9 events per 100,000 population-year (95% confidence interval 7.0 to 14.8). We conclude that exposure to elevated light pollution levels could be a risk factor for breast cancer in Slovakia. This work can interest researchers who study relationships between atmospheric pollutants and the growing cancer epidemic. The results and the methodology can be extrapolated to any country in the world if data is available.""","""['Héctor Lamphar', 'Miroslav Kocifaj', 'Jorge Limón-Romero', 'Jorge Paredes-Tavares', 'Safei Diba Chakameh', 'Michal Mego', 'Natalia Jorgelina Prado', 'Yolanda Angélica Baez-López', 'Emiliano Raúl Diez']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Sci Total Environ""","""['The association between artificial light at night and prostate cancer in Gwangju City and South Jeolla Province of South Korea.', 'Nocturnal light pollution and underexposure to daytime sunlight: Complementary mechanisms of circadian disruption and related diseases.', 'Disaggregating the effects of daytime and nighttime light exposures on obesity, overweight, prostate and breast cancer morbidity worldwide.', 'Is prostate cancer incidence worldwide linked to artificial light at night exposures?

Palmitic acid is a common saturated long-chain fatty acid that is known to exhibit anti-inflammatory and metabolic regulatory effects and antitumor activities in several types of tumors. The present study aims to explore the antiproliferative and antimetastatic activities of palmitic acid on human prostate cancer cells and the underlying mechanism.  Main methods:   MTT and colony formation assays were utilized to determine the antiproliferative effect of palmitic acid. Cell metastasis was evaluated by wound healing, Transwell migration and invasion assay. The in vivo anticancer effect was assessed by a nude mouse xenograft model of prostate cancer. The involved molecular mechanisms were investigated by flow cytometry and Western blot analysis.  Key findings:   Palmitic acid significantly suppressed prostate cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with palmitic acid induced G1 phase arrest, which was associated with downregulation of cyclin D1 and p-Rb and upregulation of p27. In addition, palmitic acid could inhibit prostate cancer cell metastasis, in which suppression of PKCζ and p-Integrinβ1 and an increase in E-cadherin expression might be involved. Furthermore, a mechanistic study indicated that palmitic acid inhibited the key molecules of the PI3K/Akt pathway to block prostate cancer proliferation and metastasis.  Significance:   Our findings suggested the antitumor potential of palmitic acid for prostate cancer by targeting the PI3K/Akt pathway.""","""['Shan Zhu', 'Wenhui Jiao', 'Yanglu Xu', 'Lanjiao Hou', 'Hui Li', 'Jingrong Shao', 'Xiaoliang Zhang', 'Ran Wang', 'Dexin Kong']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Life Sci""","""['Breviscapine suppresses the growth and metastasis of prostate cancer through regulating PAQR4-mediated PI3K/Akt pathway.', 'Oleanolic acid inhibits cell survival and proliferation of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo through the PI3K/Akt pathway.', 'Inositol hexaphosphate suppresses growth and induces apoptosis in prostate carcinoma cells in culture and nude mouse xenograft: PI3K-Akt pathway as potential target.', 'The PI3K/AKT pathway in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer.', 'Novel Insights into Autophagy and Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Study of the Phytochemical Composition, Antioxidant Properties, and In Vitro Anti-Diabetic Efficacy of Gracilaria bursa-pastoris Extracts.', 'Breviscapine regulates the proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis of colorectal cancer cells via the PI3K/AKT pathway.', 'Integrating network pharmacology and experimental validation to explore the effect and mechanism of AD-1 in the treatment of colorectal cancer.', 'Evaluation of acute oral toxicity of Ipomoea turpethum extract loaded polymeric nanoparticles in Wistar rats.', 'Metabolites and Bioactivity of the Marine Xestospongia Sponges (Porifera, Demospongiae, Haplosclerida) of Southeast Asian Waters.']"""

Therefore, a computational approach to predict candidate genes related to complex diseases including cancer has been extensively studied. In this study, we propose a convolutional neural network-based knowledge graph-embedding model (KGED), which is based on a biological knowledge graph with entity descriptions to infer relationships between biological entities. As an application demonstration, we generated gene-interaction networks for each cancer type using gene-gene relationships inferred by KGED. We then analyzed the constructed gene networks using network centrality measures, including betweenness, closeness, degree, and eigenvector centrality metrics, to rank the central genes of the network and identify highly correlated cancer genes. Furthermore, we evaluated our proposed approach for prostate, breast, and lung cancers by comparing the performance with that of existing approaches. The KGED model showed improved performance in predicting cancer-related genes using the inferred gene-gene interactions. Thus, we conclude that gene-gene interactions inferred by KGED can be helpful for future research, such as that aimed at future research on pathogenic mechanisms of human diseases, and contribute to the field of disease treatment discovery.""","""['Wonjun Choi', 'Hyunju Lee']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Analyzing a co-occurrence gene-interaction network to identify disease-gene association.', 'Graph Convolutional Network and Convolutional Neural Network Based Method for Predicting lncRNA-Disease Associations.', 'Graph-theoretical comparison of normal and tumor networks in identifying BRCA genes.', 'Inferring and analyzing module-specific lncRNA-mRNA causal regulatory networks in human cancer.', 'Genetic and familial factors influencing breast, colon, prostate and lung cancers.', 'RelCurator: a text mining-based curation system for extracting gene-phenotype relationships specific to neurodegenerative disorders.', 'Healthcare knowledge graph construction: A systematic review of the state-of-the-art, open issues, and opportunities.', 'Effective holistic characterization of small molecule effects using heterogeneous biological networks.']"""

There is a critical need to identify new mechanisms that contribute to PCa progression, that distinguish benign from lethal disease, and that have potential for therapeutic targeting. P2X4 belongs to the P2 purinergic receptor family that is commonly upregulated in cancer and is associated with poorer outcomes. We observed P2X4 protein expression primarily in epithelial cells of the prostate, a subset of CD66+ neutrophils, and most CD68+ macrophages. Our analysis of tissue microarrays representing 491 PCa cases demonstrated significantly elevated P2X4 expression in cancer- compared with benign-tissue spots, in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and in PCa with ERG positivity or with PTEN loss. High-level P2X4 expression in benign tissues was likewise associated with the development of metastasis after radical prostatectomy. Treatment with the P2X4-specific agonist cytidine 5'-triphosphate (CTP) increased Transwell migration and invasion of PC3, DU145, and CWR22Rv1 PCa cells. The P2X4 antagonist 5-(3-bromophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-2H-benzofuro[3,2-e]-1,4-diazepin-2-one (5-BDBD) resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in viability of PC3, DU145, LNCaP, CWR22Rv1, TRAMP-C2, Myc-CaP, BMPC1, and BMPC2 cells and decreased DU145 cell migration and invasion. Knockdown of P2X4 attenuated growth, migration, and invasion of PCa cells. Finally, knockdown of P2X4 in Myc-CaP cells resulted in significantly attenuated subcutaneous allograft growth in FVB/NJ mice. Collectively, these data strongly support a role for the P2X4 purinergic receptor in PCa aggressiveness and identify P2X4 as a candidate for therapeutic targeting. © 2021 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Fractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) or single fraction stereotactic body radiosurgery (SRS) are emerging treatment options in this setting. However, data on SBRT/SRS in patients with metastatic castration-resistant PC (mCRPC) are largely lacking, particularly in subjects with nodal lesions. Therefore, we evaluated outcomes and toxicity recorded in mCRPC patients with nodal oligoprogression. Patients included in this analysis had ≤ 5 metastatic sites without visceral lesions and underwent SBRT/SRS on nodal metastases. Thirty-eight patients carrying out 61 nodal metastases were analyzed. The median SRS dose was 20 Gy (range 12-24 Gy) and the most common schedule was 20 Gy (44.8%). The median SBRT dose was 45 Gy (range 20-50 Gy) and the most common regimen was 45 Gy in 5 fractions (37.9%). Thirty-seven patients (97.4%) showed only grade 0-1 acute toxicity while one patient reported grade 2 dysphagia. In terms of late toxicity, one grade 2 laryngeal, one grade 1 skin and one grade 1 gastrointestinal toxicities were recorded.

Two-year next line systemic therapy-free survival (NEST-FS) was 67.7%. In conclusion, the efficacy in terms of LC of SBRT/SRS in patients with nodal metastases from PC was confirmed.

In the whole-body hyperthermia groups, the IFP reduction from the baseline at the tumor center immediately after heating was found to be statistically significant when compared to the control group. The 1 h of local heating group showed IFP reductions at the tumor center, while the IFPs increased in the periphery of the tumor. The intratumoral gold nanoparticle accumulation was quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).

The aim of our study was to compare the diagnostic performance of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT (PSMA PET/CT), mpMRI, and PSMA PET/CT + mpMRI using 3 independent masked readers for each modality and with histopathology as the gold standard in the detection, intraprostatic localization, and determination of local extension of primary prostate cancer. Methods: Patients with intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer who underwent PSMA PET/CT as part of a prospective trial (NCT03368547) and mpMRI before radical prostatectomy were included. Each imaging modality was interpreted by 3 independent readers who were unaware of the other modality result. A central majority rule was applied (2:1). Pathologic examination of whole-mount slices was used as the gold standard. Imaging scans and whole-mount slices were interpreted using the same standardized approach on a segment level and a lesion level. A ""neighboring"" approach was used to define imaging-pathology correlation for the detection of individual prostate cancer foci. Accuracy in determining the location, extraprostatic extension (EPE), and seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) of prostate cancer foci was assessed using receiver-operating-characteristic curve analysis. Interreader agreement was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficient analysis. Results: The final analysis included 74 patients (14 [19%] with intermediate risk and 60 [81%] with high risk). The cancer detection rate (lesion-based analysis) was 85%, 83%, and 87% for PSMA PET/CT, mpMRI, and PSMA PET/CT + mpMRI, respectively. The change in AUC was statistically significant between PSMA PET/CT + mpMRI and the 2 imaging modalities alone for delineation of tumor localization (segment-based analysis) (P < 0.001) but not between PSMA PET/CT and mpMRI (P = 0.093). mpMRI outperformed PSMA PET/CT in detecting EPE (P = 0.002) and SVI (P = 0.001). In the segment-level analysis, intraclass correlation coefficient analysis showed moderate reliability among PSMA PET/CT and mpMRI readers using a 5-point Likert scale (range, 0.53-0.64). In the evaluation of T staging, poor reliability was found among PSMA PET/CT readers and poor to moderate reliability was found for mpMRI readers. Conclusion: PSMA PET/CT and mpMRI have similar accuracy in the detection and intraprostatic localization of prostate cancer foci. mpMRI performs better in identifying EPE and SVI. For the T-staging evaluation of intermediate to high-risk prostate cancer, mpMRI should still be considered the imaging modality of reference.

Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to determine risk factors associated with CAT and the effect of CAT on all-cause mortality. 942 019 patients with cancer were identified; 62 003 (6.6%) had an incident diagnosis of CAT. Patients with pancreatic, brain, ovarian, and lung cancer had the highest, and patients with breast and prostate cancer had the lowest 12-month cumulative incidence of CAT. For most malignancies, men, those with metastatic disease and more comorbidities, and African Americans (vs non-Hispanic Whites) were at highest risk for CAT. Patients diagnosed with cancer between 2014 and 2017 had a higher risk of CAT compared with those diagnosed between 2005 and 2007. CAT was associated with increased overall mortality for all malignancies (HR ranges 1.89 to 4.79). The incidence of CAT increased over time and was driven by an increase in pulmonary embolism±deep vein thrombosis (PE±DVT).

However, the role of STEAP family in glioma remains unclear. Here, we systematically evaluated the relationship between STEAP family and prognosis of glioma patients in multiple cohorts. The analysis showed that dysregulation of STEAP family may affect cancer-immunity cycle, immune infiltration and phenotypes resulting in an immunosuppressive microenvironment in glioma. To accurately predict the prognosis of glioma patients, gene-based risk models were established based on the expression of STEAP1, 2 and 3. Multivariate and univariate Cox analyses demonstrated that the risk models could independently predict the prognosis of glioma.

Results:   Meeting inclusion criteria were 16,365,833 PSA and 48,819 prostate biopsy results. The average monthly number of PSA tests declined from 465,187 prepandemic to 295,786 early-pandemic (36.4% decrease; P = .01) before rebounding to 483,374 (3.9% increase; P = .23) late-pandemic.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the modulation patterns between apoptosis and autophagy following dual inhibition by Akt inhibitor erufosine and Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-737 in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cell lines, PC-3 (Bax+) and DU-145 (Bax-).  Methods and results:   Cell cycle progression, apoptotic and autophagic signaling were examined by flow cytometry, multi-caspase assay, Hoechst staining, acridine orange staining of acidic vesicular organelles (AVOs), qRT-PCR and Western Blot. Dual inhibition increased G2/M arrest in PC-3 and DU-145, but not in the healthy prostate epithelium cells, PNT-1A. Only in PC-3, dual inhibition induced synergistic apoptotic and additive autophagic effects. In DU-145 and PNT-1A cells, ABT-737 did not display any remarkable effect on multicaspase activity and erufosine and ABT-737, neither alone nor in combination induced AVOs. By dual inhibition, AKT, BCL-2 and NF-κB gene expressions were downregulated in PC-3, both ATG-5 and BECLIN-1 gene expressions were upregulated in DU-145 but Beclin-1 protein expression was substantially reduced in both CRPC cells. Dual inhibition-induced synergistic multicaspase activation in PC-3 degrades and disrupts autophagic activity of Beclin-1, enhancing caspase-dependent apoptosis. However, in DU-145, following dual inhibition, rate of multicaspase induction and apoptosis are lower but autophagy is completely abolished despite markedly increased BECLIN-1 gene expression.  Conclusion:   In conclusion, antineoplastic drug combinations may display cell-type specific modulation of apoptotic and autophagic signaling and lack of protective autophagy may not necessarily indicate increased chemotherapeutic sensitivity in heterogenous tumor subpopulations.""","""['Ezgi Avsar Abdik', 'Hüseyin Abdik', 'Duygu Turan', 'Fikrettin Sahin', 'Martin R Berger', 'Ferda Kaleagasioglu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Mol Biol Rep""","""['ABT-737 and erufosine combination against castration-resistant prostate cancer: a promising but cell-type specific response associated with the modulation of anti-apoptotic signaling.', 'Pro-survival responses to the dual inhibition of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins and mTOR-mediated signaling in hypoxic colorectal carcinoma cells.', ""Phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT/mTORC1/2 signaling determines sensitivity of Burkitt's lymphoma cells to BH3 mimetics."", 'Novel Insights into Autophagy and Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Therapeutic Properties of Flavonoids in Treatment of Cancer through Autophagic Modulation: A Systematic Review.']"""

The clinical diagnosis of this disease is dependent on biopsy and histological assessment: methods that are experience-based and easily misdiagnosed due to tumor heterogeneity. The development of robust diagnostic tools for NEPC may assist clinicians in making medical decisions on the choice of continuing anti-androgen receptor therapy or switching to platinum-based chemotherapy. Methods: Gene expression profiles and clinical characteristics data of 208 samples of metastatic CRPC, including castration-resistant prostate adenocarcinoma (CRPC-adeno) and castration-resistant neuroendocrine prostate adenocarcinoma (CRPC-NE), were obtained from the prad_su2c_2019 dataset. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was subsequently used to construct a free-scale gene co-expression network to study the interrelationship between the potential modules and clinical features of metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma and to identify hub genes in the modules. Furthermore, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis was used to build a model to predict the clinical characteristics of CRPC-NE. The findings were then verified in the nepc_wcm_2016 dataset. Results: A total of 51 co-expression modules were successfully constructed using WGCNA, of which three co-expression modules were found to be significantly associated with the neuroendocrine features and the NEPC score. In total, four novel genes, including NPTX1, PCSK1, ASXL3, and TRIM9, were all significantly upregulated in NEPC compared with the adenocarcinoma samples, and these genes were all associated with the neuroactive ligand receptor interaction pathway. Next, the expression levels of these four genes were used to construct an NEPC diagnosis model, which was successfully able to distinguish CRPC-NE from CRPC-adeno samples in both the training and the validation cohorts. Moreover, the values of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) were 0.995 and 0.833 for the training and validation cohorts, respectively.

To date, prostate cancer patient-derived xenograft (PCPDX) models to study this disease have been difficult to establish because of limited specimen availability and poor uptake rates in immunodeficient mice. Ancestrally diverse PCPDXs are even more rare, and only six PCPDXs from self-identified African American patients from one institution were recently made available.  Methods:   In the present study, we established a PCPDX from prostate cancer tissue from a patient of estimated 90% West African ancestry with metastatic castration resistant disease, and characterized this model's pathology, karyotype, hotspot mutations, copy number, gene fusions, gene expression, growth rate in normal and castrated mice, therapeutic response, and experimental metastasis.  Results:   This PCPDX has a mutation in TP53 and loss of PTEN and RB1. We have documented a 100% take rate in mice after thawing the PCPDX tumor from frozen stock. The PCPDX is castrate- and docetaxel-resistant and cisplatin-sensitive, and has gene expression patterns associated with such drug responses. After tail vein injection, the PCPDX tumor cells can colonize the lungs of mice.  Conclusion:   This PCPDX, along with others that are established and characterized, will be useful pre-clinically for studying the heterogeneity of prostate cancer biology and testing new therapeutics in models expected to be reflective of the clinical setting.""","""['Brendon M Patierno', 'Wen-Chi Foo', 'Tyler Allen', 'Jason A Somarelli', 'Kathryn E Ware', 'Santosh Gupta', 'Sandra Wise', 'John P Wise Sr', 'Xiaodi Qin', 'Dadong Zhang', 'Lingfan Xu', 'Yanjing Li', 'Xufeng Chen', 'Brant A Inman', 'Shannon J McCall', 'Jiaoti Huang', 'Rick A Kittles', 'Kouros Owzar', 'Simon Gregory', 'Andrew J Armstrong', 'Daniel J George', 'Steven R Patierno', 'David S Hsu#', 'Jennifer A Freedman#']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Androgen receptor enhancer amplification in matched patient-derived xenografts of primary and castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'LuCaP Prostate Cancer Patient-Derived Xenografts Reflect the Molecular Heterogeneity of Advanced Disease an--d Serve as Models for Evaluating Cancer Therapeutics.', 'PCSD1, a new patient-derived model of bone metastatic prostate cancer, is castrate-resistant in the bone-niche.', 'Treating Patients with Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review of Available Therapies.', 'Efficacy Against Human Prostate Cancer by Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-specific, Transforming Growth Factor-β Insensitive Genetically Targeted CD8+ T-cells Derived from Patients with Metastatic Castrate-resistant Disease.', 'The future of patient-derived xenografts in prostate cancer research.']"""

Method:   The safety analysis population of 296 patients was stratified into two groups based on age (<75 and ≥ 75 years-old [yo]), and their characteristics, drugrelated treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and clinical laboratory values were evaluated. Additionally, these endpoints were evaluated in patients aged ≥ 80 yo.  Results:   There were 148 patients in each of the <75-yo and ≥ 75-yo age groups, and 69 patients in the ≥ 80-yo age group. The characteristics of patients in the <75-yo group were suggestive of more aggressive disease at diagnosis of prostate cancer and a greater proportion of patients had prior chemotherapy compared with patients in the ≥ 75-yo age group. The incidences of overall drugrelated TEAEs and drug-related hematological TEAEs were slightly higher in the <75-yo age group; however, there was little difference in the incidences of drug-related TEAEs leading to drug discontinuation (1.4-4.1%) between patient groups.

However, paradoxical growth inhibition has been observed in a subset of prostate cancer upon administration of supraphysiologic levels of testosterone (SupraT), both experimentally and clinically. Here we report that SupraT activates cytoplasmic nucleic acid sensors and induces growth inhibition of SupraT-sensitive prostate cancer cells. This was initiated by the induction of two parallel autophagy-mediated processes, namely, ferritinophagy and nucleophagy. Consequently, autophagosomal DNA activated nucleic acid sensors converge on NFκB to drive immune signaling pathways. Chemokines and cytokines secreted by the tumor cells in response to SupraT resulted in increased migration of cytotoxic immune cells to tumor beds in xenograft models and patient tumors. Collectively, these findings indicate that SupraT may inhibit a subset of prostate cancer by activating nucleic acid sensors and downstream immune signaling.

Materials and methods:   Fifty-one patients with biopsy confirmed PCa underwent prostate multiparametric MRI on 3T MR scanner prior to RT. Thirty-seven men (73%) were treated with external beam RT alone, 12 men (24%) were treated with brachytherapy monotherapy, and two men (4%) were treated with external beam RT with brachytherapy boost. The index lesion was outlined by a radiologist and quantitative apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), T2 and DCE parameters were measured. Biochemical failure was defined using the Phoenix criteria.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 65 months, seven patients had biochemical failure. ADC had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.71 for predicting RT outcome with significantly lower ADC (0.78 ± 0.17 vs 0.96 ± 0.26 µm2/ms, p = 0.04) of the index lesion in men with biochemical failure. Ideal ADC cutoff point (Youdens index) was 0.96 µm2/ms which had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 48% for predicting biochemical failure. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that lower ADC values were associated with significantly lower freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF, p = 0.03, no failures out of 20 men if ADC ≥ 0.96 µm2/ms; seven of 31 with failures if ADC < 0.96 µm2/ms). On multivariable analysis, ADC was associated with FFBF (HR 0.96 per increase in ADC of 0.01 um2/ms [95% CI, 0.92-1.00]; p = 0.042) after accounting for National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk category (p = 0.064) and receipt of androgen deprivation therapy (p = 0.141). Quantitative T2 and DCE parameters were not associated with biochemical outcome.  Conclusion:   Our results suggest that quantitative ADC values of the index lesion may predict biochemical failure following primary radiotherapy in patients with PCa. Lower ADC values were associated with inferior biochemical control.""","""['Aritrick Chatterjee', 'William Tyler Turchan', 'Xiaobing Fan', 'Alexander Griffin', 'Ambereen Yousuf', 'Gregory S Karczmar', 'Stanley L Liauw', 'Aytekin Oto']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Acad Radiol""","""['The prognostic value of mean apparent diffusion coefficient measured with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance image in patients with prostate cancer treated with definitive radiotherapy.', 'Multiparametric prostate MR imaging with T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences: are all pulse sequences necessary to detect locally recurrent prostate cancer after radiation therapy?', 'Multiparametric MRI for detection of radiorecurrent prostate cancer: added value of apparent diffusion coefficient maps and dynamic contrast-enhanced images.', 'Revisiting quantitative multi-parametric MRI of benign prostatic hyperplasia and its differentiation from transition zone cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Radiogenomic profiling of prostate tumors prior to external beam radiotherapy converges on a transcriptomic signature of TGF-β activity driving tumor recurrence.', 'A new technique for trans-perirectal iodine-125 seed implantation in prostatic cancer guided by CT and 3D printed template: Two case reports.', 'Longitudinal Changes and Predictive Value of Multiparametric MRI Features for Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with MRI-Guided Lattice Extreme Ablative Dose (LEAD) Boost Radiotherapy.']"""

Data was from seventy prostate cancer patients who underwent multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) and subsequent prostatectomy. The scans included T2-weighted imaging (T2W), diffusion weighted imaging, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE MRI), and MR spectroscopic imaging. Histopathology tissue information was translated to MRI images. The mpMRI parameters were characterized separately per zone and by tissue type. The tissues were ordered according to trends in tissue parameter means. The peripheral zone tissue order was cystic atrophy, high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), normal, atrophy, inflammation, and cancer. Decreasing values for tissue order were exhibited by ADC (1.8 10-3 mm2/s to 1.2 10-3 mm2/s) and T2W intensity (3447 to 2576). Increasing values occurred for DCE MRI peak (143% to 157%), DCE MRI slope (101%/min to 169%/min), fractional anisotropy (FA) (0.16 to 0.19), choline (7.2 to 12.2), and choline / citrate (0.3 to 0.9). The transition zone tissue order was cystic atrophy, mixed benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), normal, atrophy, inflammation, stroma, anterior fibromuscular stroma, and cancer. Decreasing values occurred for ADC (1.6 10-3 mm2/s to 1.1 10-3 mm2/s) and T2W intensity (2863 to 2001). Increasing values occurred for DCE MRI peak (143% to 150%), DCE MRI slope (101%/min to 137%/min), FA (0.18 to 0.25), choline (7.9 to 11.7), and choline / citrate (0.3 to 0.7). Logistic regression was used to create parameter model fits to differentiate cancer from benign prostate tissues. The fits achieved AUCs ≥0.91.

Differential expression of the target genes was performed via the GENT2 database in the GPL96 platform (HG-U133A). Results indicated all genes were downregulated. Gene Ontology (GO) was used to perform enrichment analysis. The GO enrichment analysis indicated that the downregulated genes were enriched in cellular response to gamma radiation, regulation of transcription and response to drugs as well as protein binding and receptor signaling protein activity.

Here, we develop a novel circulating tumor cell (CTC)-based transcriptomic profiling assay to translate tissue-based messenger RNA (mRNA) signatures into a liquid biopsy setting for noninvasive HCC prognostication. The HCC-CTC mRNA scoring system combines the NanoVelcro CTC Assay for enriching HCC CTCs and the NanoString nCounter platform for quantifying the HCC-CTC Risk Score (RS) panel in enriched HCC CTCs. The prognostic role of the HCC-CTC RS was assessed in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) HCC cohort (n = 362) and validated in an independent clinical CTC cohort (n = 40). The HCC-CTC RS panel was developed through our integrated data analysis framework of 8 HCC tissue-based gene signatures and identified the top 10 prognostic genes (discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 1 [DDR1], enoyl-CoA hydratase and 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase [EHHADH], androgen receptor [AR], lumican [LUM], hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 6[HSD17B6], prostate transmembrane protein, androgen induced 1 [PMEPA1], tsukushi, small leucine rich proteoglycan [TSKU], N-terminal EF-hand calcium binding protein 2 [NECAB2], ladinin 1 [LAD1], solute carrier family 27 member 5 [SLC27A5]) highly expressed in HCC with low expressions in white blood cells. The panel accurately discriminated overall survival in TCGA HCC cohort (hazard ratio [HR], 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-2.9). The combined use of the scoring system and HCC-CTC RS panel successfully distinguished artificial blood samples spiked with an aggressive HCC cell type, SNU-387, from those spiked with PLC/PRF/5 cells (P = 0.02).

Cervical transitional cell metaplasia and superficial clusters of small basophilic cells have been described in the context of gender-affirming testosterone therapy; these findings may be misdiagnosed as high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or endometrial cells on Pap smears. Prostatic metaplasia has been reported in the surface squamous epithelium of the vagina and the uterine cervix in individuals undergoing gender-affirming androgen therapy; this finding is often associated with NKX3.1-positive basal keratinocytes. The aim of this study was to assess the morphological and immunohistochemical features of the uterine cervix in gender-affirming hysterectomies in comparison with benign hysterectomies from cisgender women.  Methods and results:   We assessed the morphological and immunohistochemical features of the uterine cervix in 49 gender-affirming hysterectomies as compared with 57 hysterectomies from cisgender patients to establish the relative prevalences of surface prostatic metaplasia, NKX3.1-positive basal keratinocytes, transitional cell metaplasia, and small basophilic cells in the cervical squamous epithelium. The cervical tissue from the gender-affirming therapy cohort showed significantly higher prevalences of NKX3.1-positive basal keratinocytes (86% versus 1.8%), transitional cell metaplasia (80% versus 3.5%), superficial clusters of small basophilic cells (67% versus 7%), and surface prostatic metaplasia (43% versus 3.5%).  Conclusion:   NKX3.1-positive basal keratinocytes, transitional cell metaplasia, small basophilic cells and surface prostatic metaplasia are all more prevalent in the cervices of individuals receiving gender-affirming testosterone therapy; awareness of this fact allows pathologists to avoid the overdiagnosis of dysplasia or the recommendation of unnecessary follow-up procedures.""","""['Emily R McMullen-Tabry', 'Andrew P Sciallis', 'Stephanie L Skala']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Histopathology""","""['Prostatic Metaplasia of the Vagina and Uterine Cervix: An Androgen-associated Glandular Lesion of Surface Squamous Epithelium.', 'Reproductive Organ Pathology of Individuals Undergoing Gender-Affirming Surgery.', 'Histologic Findings in Gynecologic Tissue From Transmasculine Individuals Undergoing Gender-Affirming Surgery.', 'Variations of mitotic index in normal and dysplastic squamous epithelium of the uterine cervix as a function of endometrial maturation.', 'Ectopic prostatic tissue in the uterine cervix: a report of four cases and review of ectopic prostatic tissue.', 'Prostatic metaplasia of the vagina in transmasculine individuals.']"""

Anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) promotes intratumoral T cell infiltration but induces upregulation of PD-1 and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) within the prostate TME. Combined anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-1 can partly overcome this adaptive resistance and was recently shown to augment responses in patients with mCRPC with measurable disease. Although bone is the most common site of metastasis in prostate cancer, patients with bone-predominant disease are frequently excluded from trials because they lack measurable disease, which limits assessment of disease progression and tissue sampling. We therefore designed this study to investigate combined ICT in mCRPC to bone.  Hypothesis:   Combined anti-CTLA-4 (tremelimumab) plus anti-PD-L1 (durvalumab) is safe and well tolerated in patients with chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC to bone.  Patients and methods:   In this single-arm pilot study, men with chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC to bone received tremelimumab (75 mg intravenous) plus durvalumab (1500 mg intravenous) every 4 weeks (up to four doses), followed by durvalumab (1500 mg intravenous) maintenance every 4 weeks (up to nine doses). The primary endpoint was incidence of adverse events. Secondary endpoints included serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), progression-free survival (PFS), radiographic PFS (rPFS), and maximal PSA decline.  Results:   Twenty-six patients were treated between August 8, 2017 and March 28, 2019. Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 11 patients (42%), with no grade 4 or 5 events. TRAEs leading to discontinuation occurred in three patients (12%). PSA decline ≥50% occurred in three patients (12%). Six patients (24%) achieved stable disease for >6 months. At a median follow-up of 43.6 months, median rPFS was 3.7 months (95% CI: 1.9 to 5.7), and median overall survival was 28.1 months (95% CI: 14.5 to 37.3). Post-treatment evaluation of the bone microenvironment revealed transcriptional upregulation in myeloid and neutrophil immune subset signatures and increased expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints.  Conclusions:   Tremelimumab plus durvalumab was safe and well tolerated in patients with chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC to bone, with potential activity in a small number of patients as measured by rPFS. Combination of CTLA-4 and PD-L1 blockade with therapies targeting the myeloid compartment or other inhibitory immune receptors may be necessary to overcome mechanisms of resistance within prostate bone microenvironment.

Methods:   To delineate the true cancer age-incidence pattern, we performed a population-based cohort study using Swedish Cancer Register data from 1970-2014 on nine common, adult (age 20-99) cancers categorized as requiring high (pancreatic, lung, non-meningioma brain), medium (anorectal, urinary bladder, non-Hodgkin lymphoma), and low (melanoma skin, breast, prostate) diagnostic invasiveness based on the perceived risk of complications associated with histopathologic verification. We estimated the reported incidence and the proportion of autopsy-detected cancers by age but also projected a corrected incidence assuming the same proportion of unexpected cancer findings if all deaths underwent autopsy.  Results:   The registered cancer incidence dropped after peak age around 65-84, with the exception of melanoma skin. This pattern was attenuated when exploring the proportion of incident, unexpected cancer findings in autopsy material by age. The ""total"" cancer incidence, reported plus projected incident autopsy cases, increased monotonously with age.  Conclusions:   The long-established cancer incidence decline in elderly is most probably an artifact due to reduced diagnostic intensity.  Impact:   Biological drivers to the cancer incidence decline in elderly are unlikely and resources are better allocated to prepare for the anticipated cancer pandemic when numbers of healthy elderly increase. Cancer alarm symptoms in elderly fit for cancer therapy should be investigated promptly and clinical cancer trials focus to also include elderly to set updated standards for cancer therapy in the dominating age group.""","""['Cecilia Radkiewicz', 'Jessica Järkvik Krönmark', 'Hans-Olov Adami', 'Gustaf Edgren']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev""","""['Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Italian cancer figures, report 2012: Cancer in children and adolescents.', 'Italian cancer figures, report 2013: Multiple tumours.', 'Common cancers in the elderly.', 'Changes in the Incidence of Cancer in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe over a 50-Year Period.', 'Reranking cancer mortality using years of life lost.', 'Recent Advances in the Aging Microenvironment of Breast Cancer.']"""

Our team has explored the barriers and facilitators of guideline-concordant prostate cancer imaging and found that (1) patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer have little concern for radiographic staging but rather focus on treatment and (2) physicians trust imaging guidelines but are apt to follow their own intuition, fear medico-legal consequences, and succumb to influence from imaging-avid colleagues. We used a theory-based approach to design a multi-level intervention strategy to promote guideline-concordant imaging to stage incident prostate cancer.  Methods:   We designed the Prostate Cancer Imaging Stewardship (PCIS) intervention: a multi-site, stepped wedge, cluster-randomized trial to determine the effect of a physician-focused behavioral intervention on Veterans Health Administration (VHA) prostate cancer imaging use. The multi-level intervention, developed according to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and Behavior Change Wheel, combines traditional physician behavior change methods with novel methods of communication and data collection. The intervention consists of three components: (1) a system of audit and feedback to clinicians informing individual clinicians and their sites about how their behavior compares to their peers' and to published guidelines, (2) a program of academic detailing with the goal to educate providers about prostate cancer imaging, and (3) a CPRS Clinical Order Check for potentially guideline-discordant imaging orders. The intervention will be introduced to 10 participating geographically distributed study sites.  Discussion:   This study is a significant contribution to implementation science, providing VHA an opportunity to ensure delivery of high-quality care at the lowest cost using a theory-based approach.

We assess the influence of patient characteristics at diagnosis of first melanoma and the type of SPC (second melanoma and other SPC) on overall survival.  Methods:   We used the Swedish Cancer Registry data to assess overall survival in melanoma for the period 1990 to 2015. Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted and hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated with Cox regression models by considering SPC diagnosis as a time-dependent variable.  Results:   A total of 46,726 patients were diagnosed with melanoma, and 15.3% of them developed SPC, among which, two thirds were other SPCs. Second melanomas were diagnosed early (31% during the first year) compared to non-melanoma SPCs (9.5%). Survival for women with second melanoma or other SPC (56 and 21% alive after 25 years of follow-up, respectively) exceeded the male rates (21 and 10%, respectively) but all these figures were lower than for females (60% alive) or males (48%) without SPC. Time dependent analysis showed vastly increased HRs for cancer types that are fatal also as first cancers, but SPC-specific HRs remained relatively uniform, irrespective of SPC diagnosed soon or late after first melanoma. In early-onset melanoma, SPC diagnosis after 10 years may not negatively influence overall survival.  Conclusions:   As the overall survival of patients with many types of SPCs is unfavorable, advice about health lifestyle should benefit smoking patients and early detection methods may be recommended for SPCs of the breast, prostate and colorectum.""","""['Guoqiao Zheng', 'Subhayan Chattopadhyay', 'Kristina Sundquist', 'Jan Sundquist', 'Asta Försti', 'Akseli Hemminki', 'Kari Hemminki']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Second Primary Cancers in Melanoma Patients Critically Shorten Survival.', 'Prostate cancer survivors: Risk and mortality in second primary cancers.', 'The effect of a gastric second primary cancer on the survival of patients with a previous cancer history.', 'Impact of family history of cancer on risk and mortality of second cancers in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Metastasis in the gallbladder: does literature reflect reality?', 'Causes of death among patients with cutaneous melanoma: a US population-based study.']"""

Spatial autocorrelation analysis was used to obtain spatial patterns, and the association between SDI and prostate cancer burden was estimated using a spatial panel model.  Results:   In Asia, the age-standardized incidence and prevalence of prostate cancer increased in almost all countries, and its mortality and DALY also increased in over half of the countries. Significantly regional disparities were found in Asia, and the hot spots for incidence, prevalence, mortality, and DALY were all located in Western Asia, the hot spots of percent change also occurred in Western Asia for incidence and DALY. Furthermore, SDI had a positive association with mortality (coef = 2.51, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.13-2.90) and negative association with DALY (coef = -14.99, 95% CI: -20.37 to -9.60) and MIR (coef = -0.95, 95%CI: -0.99 to -0.92).

The herb is frequently used for gynecological issues such as menstrual problems, facilitating and quickening delivery, post-partum medication, treats flatulence and dysentery, and. MP extracts are thought to aid in the firming and toning of abdominal muscles, tighten breasts and vaginal muscles, and anti-dysmenorrhea. It also was used for the treatment of gonorrhea and hemorrhoids. As MP product has been produced commercially recently, more in-depth studies should be conducted. The presence of numerous active compounds in MP might provide a synergistic effect and potentially offer other health benefits than those already identified and known.  Aim of the study:   This study aimed to use a computational target fishing approach to predict the possible therapeutic effect of Marantodes pumilum and evaluated their effectivity.  Materials and methods:   This study involves a computational approach to identify the potential targets by using target fishing. Several databases were used: PubChem database to obtain the chemical structure of interested compounds; Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP) server and the SWISSADME web tool to identify and select the compounds having drug-likeness properties; PharmMapper was used to identify top ten target protein of the selected compounds and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) was used to predict human genetic problems; the gene id of top-10 proteins was obtained from UniProtKB to be analyzed by using GeneMANIA server to check the genes' function and their co-expression; Gene Pathway established by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) of the selected targets were analyzed by using EnrichR server and confirmed by using DAVID (The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) version 6.8 and STRING database. All the interaction data was analyzed by Cytoscape version 3.7.2 software. The protein structure of most putative proteins was obtained from the RCSB protein data bank. Thedocking analysis was conducted using PyRx biological software v0.8 and illustrated by BIOVIA Discovery Studio Visualizer version 20.1.0. As a preliminary evaluation, a cell viability assay using Sulforhodamine B was conducted to evaluate the potential of the predicted therapeutic effect.  Results:   It was found that four studied compounds are highly correlated with three proteins: EFGR, CDK2, and ESR1. These proteins are highly associated with cancer pathways, especially breast cancer and prostate cancer. Qualitatively, cell proliferation assay conducted shown that the extract has IC50 of 88.69 μg/ml against MCF-7 and 66.51 μg/ml against MDA-MB-231.  Conclusions:   Natural herbs are one of the most common forms of complementary and alternative medicine, and they play an important role in disease treatment. The results of this study show that in addition to being used traditionally to maintain women's health, the use of Marantodes pumilum indirectly has the potential to protect against the development of cancer cells, especially breast cancer.

Cox models provided hazard ratios (HR) for different exposure groups within the cohort.  Results:   5,702 individuals with cancer were identified. SIR for overall cancer was 1.04 for men (95%CI 0.96-1.12) and 0.89 for women (95%CI 0.82-0.96) who ever lived in the contaminated drinking water area. Kidney cancer, which was reported with increased risk in C8 study, showed somewhat elevated HR in this study (HR 1.27; 95%CI 0.85-1.89). The HR was modestly elevated for bladder cancer (HR 1.32; 95%CI 1.01-1.72), and reduced for prostate cancer (HR 0.83; 95%CI 0.71-0.98). In subjects who ever lived in the contaminated water area during 2005-2013, when exposure was estimated to be highest, higher risks for kidney cancer (HR 1.84; 95%CI 1.00-3.37) but lower for prostate cancer (HR 0.76; 95%CI 0.59-0.98) were observed.  Conclusion:   Analysis of this large cohort exposed to high levels of PFAS, dominated by PFHxS and PFOS, revealed no evidence for an overall increased risk of cancer. A moderately increased risk of kidney cancer was observed, in accordance with previous findings after PFAS exposure dominated by PFOA.""","""['Huiqi Li', 'Sofia Hammarstrand', 'Bo Midberg', 'Yiyi Xu', 'Ying Li', 'Daniel S Olsson', 'Tony Fletcher', 'Kristina Jakobsson', 'Eva M Andersson']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Environ Res""","""['Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in drinking water and risk for polycystic ovarian syndrome, uterine leiomyoma, and endometriosis: A Swedish cohort study.', 'Serum perfluoroalkyl substances in residents following long-term drinking water contamination from firefighting foam in Ronneby, Sweden.', 'Exposure to high levels of PFAS through drinking water is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes-findings from a register-based study in Ronneby, Sweden.', 'Recent US State and Federal Drinking Water Guidelines for Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances.', 'Per and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) as a contaminant of emerging concern in surface water: A transboundary review of their occurrences and toxicity effects.', 'A Nested Case-Control Study of Serum Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances and Testicular Germ Cell Tumors among U.S. Air Force Servicemen.', 'Invited Perspective: The Slow Road to Finding Out Whether the ""Forever"" Chemicals Cause Chronic Disease.', 'A prospective nested case-control study of serum concentrations of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and aggressive prostate cancer risk.', 'Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure in relation to the kidneys: A review of current available literature.', 'The Role of Ferroptosis in the Damage of Human Proximal Tubule Epithelial Cells Caused by Perfluorooctane Sulfonate.']"""

The prostate-specific phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (Pten) gene-conditional knockout (KO) mouse carcinogenesis model is highly desirable for studying prostate cancer biology and prevention due to its close resemblance of primary molecular defects and histopathological features of human prostate cancer. We have recently published macromolecular profiling of this model by proteomics and transcriptomics, denoting a preeminence of inflammation and myeloid suppressive immune cell features. Here, we performed metabolomic analyses of Pten-KO prostate versus wild type (WT) counterpart for discernable changes in the aqueous metabolites and contrasted to those in the TRAMP neuroendocrine carcinoma (NECa).  Methods:   Three matched pairs of tissue-specific conditional Pten-KO mouse prostate and WT prostate of litter/cage-mates at 20-22 weeks of age and three pairs of TRAMP NECa versus WT (28-31 weeks) were profiled for their global aqueous metabolite changes, using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.  Results:   The Pten-KO prostate increased purine nucleotide pools, cystathionine, and both reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH, GSSG), and gluconate/glucuronate species in addition to cholesteryl sulfate and polyamine precursor ornithine. On the contrary, Pten-KO prostate contained diminished pools of glycolytic intermediates and phosphorylcholine derivatives, select amino acids, and their metabolites. Bioinformatic integration revealed a significant shunting of glucose away from glycolysis-citrate cycle and glycerol-lipid genesis to pentose phosphate cycle for NADPH/GSH/GSSG redox and pentose moieties for purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, and glycosylation/glucuronidation. Implicit arginine catabolism to ornithine was consistent with immunosuppression in Pten-KO model. While also increased in cystathionine-GSH/GSSG, purine, and pyrimidine nucleotide pools and glucuronidation at the expense of glycolysis-citrate cycle, the TRAMP NECa increased abundance of many amino acids, methyl donor S-adenosyl-methionine, and intermediates for phospholipids without increasing cholesteryl sulfate or ornithine.  Conclusions:   The aqueous metabolomic patterns in Pten-KO prostate and TRAMP NECa shared similarities in the greater pools of cystathionine, GSH/GSSG redox pair, and nucleotides and shunting away from glycolysis-citrate cycle in both models. Remarkable metabolic distinctions between them included metabolisms of many amino acids (protein synthesis; arginine-ornithine/immune suppression) and cholesteryl sulfate and methylation donor for epigenetic regulations.""","""['Sangyub Kim', 'Li Li', 'Jinhui Zhang', 'Cheng Jiang', 'Junxuan Lü']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Proteomic and transcriptomic profiling of Pten gene-knockout mouse model of prostate cancer.', 'PTEN-knockout regulates metabolic rewiring and epigenetic reprogramming in prostate cancer and chemoprevention by triterpenoid ursolic acid.', 'Activated polyamine catabolism depletes acetyl-CoA pools and suppresses prostate tumor growth in TRAMP mice.', 'Metabolic profiling of transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) tissue by 1H-NMR analysis: evidence for unusual phospholipid metabolism.', 'P21 and P27 promote tumorigenesis and progression via cell cycle acceleration in seminal vesicles of TRAMP mice.', 'Combined Transcriptome and Metabolome Analysis of Smooth Muscle of Myostatin Knockout Cattle.']"""

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is an established biomarker for prostate cancer imaging and therapy.  Methods:   Mass spectrometry was used to analyze the distribution of the site-specific glycoforms of PSMA in insect, human embryonic kidney, and prostate cancer cells, and in prostate tissue upon immunoaffinity enrichment.  Results:   While recombinant PSMA expressed in insect cells was decorated mainly by paucimannose and high mannose glycans, complex, hybrid, and high mannose glycans were detected in samples from human cells and tissue. We noted an interesting spatial distribution of the glycoforms on the PSMA surface-high mannose glycans were the dominant glycoforms at the N459, N476, and N638 sequons facing the plasma membrane, while the N121, N195, and N336 sites, located at the exposed apical PSMA domain, carried primarily complex glycans. The presence of high mannose glycoforms at the former sequons likely results from the limited access of enzymes of the glycosynthetic pathway required for the synthesis of the complex structures. In line with the limited accessibility of membrane-proximal sites, no glycosylation was observed at the N51 site positioned closest to the membrane.  Conclusions:   Our study presents initial descriptive analysis of the glycoforms of PSMA observed in cell lines and in prostate tissue. It will hopefully stimulate further research into PSMA glycoforms in the context of tumor staging, noninvasive detection of prostate tumors, and the impact of glycoforms on physicochemical and enzymatic characteristics of PSMA in a tissue-specific manner.""","""['Wei Yuan', 'Baoqin Liu', 'Miloslav Sanda', 'Renhuizi Wei', 'Julius Benicky', 'Zora Novakova', 'Cyril Barinka', 'Radoslav Goldman']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Apical transport and folding of prostate-specific membrane antigen occurs independent of glycan processing.', 'N-glycosylation and microtubule integrity are involved in apical targeting of prostate-specific membrane antigen: implications for immunotherapy.', 'Cloning and characterization of canine prostate-specific membrane antigen.', 'Current application and future perspectives of prostate specific membrane antigen PET imaging in prostate cancer.', 'Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) ligands for diagnosis and therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Site-Specific Intact N-Linked Glycopeptide Characterization of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen from Metastatic Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Site-specific glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2: Big challenges in mass spectrometry analysis.']"""

Here, we sequenced the complete genome of Nodularia sphaerocarpa UHCC 0038 and identified the 43.7 kb suomilide biosynthetic gene cluster. Bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that suomilide belongs to the aeruginosin family of natural products. We identified 103 complete aeruginosin biosynthetic gene clusters from 12 cyanobacterial genera and showed that they encode an unexpected chemical diversity. Surprisingly, purified suomilide inhibited human trypsin-2 and -3, with IC50 values of 4.7 and 11.5 nM, respectively, while trypsin-1 was inhibited with an IC50 of 104 nM. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that suomilide has a long residence time when bound to trypsins. This was confirmed experimentally for trypsin-1 and -3 (residence times of 1.5 and 57 min, respectively). Suomilide also inhibited the invasion of aggressive and metastatic PC-3M prostate cancer cells without affecting cell proliferation. The potent inhibition of trypsin-3, together with a long residence time and the ability to inhibit prostate cancer cell invasion, makes suomilide an attractive drug lead for targeting cancers that overexpress trypsin-3.

Methods:   The effect of LLM on cMyc expression and activity was determined by western blotting/confocal microscopy and luciferase reporter assay, respectively. A transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer (Hi-Myc) was used to determine chemopreventive efficacy of LLM.  Results:   Exposure of androgen sensitive (LNCaP) and castration-resistant (22Rv1) human prostate cancer cells to LLM resulted in downregulation of protein and mRNA levels of cMyc. Overexpression of cMyc partially attenuated LLM-mediated inhibition of colony formation, cell viability, and cell migration in 22Rv1 and/or PC-3 cells. LLM treatment decreased protein levels of cMyc targets (e.g., lactate dehydrogenase), however, overexpression of cMyc did not attenuate these effects. A trend for a decrease in expression level of cMyc protein was discernible in 22Rv1 xenografts from LLM-treated mice compared with control mice. The LLM treatment (10 mg/kg body weight, 5 times/week) was well-tolerated by Hi-Myc transgenic mice. The incidence of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, adenocarcinoma in situ, and microinvasion was lower in LLM-treated Hi-Myc mice but the difference was not statistically significant.

An initial evaluation involved the use of multiple control samples representing each of the pathogenic founder/recurrent variants included in the BRCA 1.0 POC Research Assay. Comparison with a validated laboratory-based first-tier real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay demonstrated 100% concordance. Clinical utility was evident in five patients with the founder BRCA2 c.7934delG variant, identified at the 10% (5/50) threshold considered cost-effective for BRCA1/2 testing. BRCA2 c.7934delG carrier status was associated with a significantly younger age (p=0.03) at diagnosis of breast cancer compared to non-carriers. In three of the BRCA2 c.7934delG carriers a high-risk MammaPrint 70-gene profile was noted, indicating a significantly increased risk for both secondary cancers and breast cancer recurrence. Initiating germline DNA testing at the POC for clinical interpretation early in the treatment planning process, will increase access to the most common pathogenic BRCA1/2 variants identified in SA and reduce loss to follow-up for timely gene-targeted risk reduction intervention. The ease of using cheek swabs/saliva in future for result generation within approximately one hour assay time, coupled with low cost and a high BRCA1/2 founder variant detection rate, will improve access to genomic medicine in Africa. Application of translational pharmacogenomics across ethnic groups, irrespective of age, family history, tumor subtype or recurrence risk profile, is imperative to sustainably implement preventative healthcare and improve clinical outcome in resource-constrained clinical settings.""","""['Lwando Mampunye', 'Nerina C van der Merwe', 'Kathleen A Grant', 'Armand V Peeters', 'Rispah Torrorey-Sawe', 'David J French', 'Kelebogile E Moremi', 'Martin Kidd', 'Petrus C van Eeden', 'Fredrieka M Pienaar', 'Maritha J Kotze']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""['Prevalence of Clinically Relevant Germline BRCA Variants in a Large Unselected South African Breast and Ovarian Cancer Cohort: A Public Sector Experience.', 'Globally Rare BRCA2 Variants With Founder Haplotypes in the South African Population: Implications for Point-of-Care Testing Based on a Single-Institution BRCA1/2 Next-Generation Sequencing Study.', 'Significant clinical impact of recurrent BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in Mexico.', 'Genetic Tests for Breast and Ovarian Cancer Internet.', 'Twenty Years of BRCA1 and BRCA2 Molecular Analysis at MMCI - Current Developments for the Classification of Variants.', 'Implementation of multigene panel testing for breast and ovarian cancer in South Africa: A step towards excellence in oncology for the public sector.', 'Feasibility of point of care testing for prevention and management of breast cancer therapy associated comorbidities in 6 African countries: short communication.', 'Genomics in Egypt: Current Status and Future Aspects.', 'Prevalence of Clinically Relevant Germline BRCA Variants in a Large Unselected South African Breast and Ovarian Cancer Cohort: A Public Sector Experience.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively collected 89 MRI studies of the pelvic cavity from patients with prostate cancer and cervical cancer. The dataset contained 89 samples from 87 patients with a total of 84 valid samples. MRI was performed with T1-weighted (T1), T2-weighted (T2), and Enhanced Dixon T1-weighted (T1DIXONC) sequences. There were two cohorts. The training cohort contained 55 samples and the testing cohort contained 29 samples. The MRI images in the training cohort contained contouring data from radiotherapist α. The MRI images in the testing cohort contained contouring data from radiotherapist α and contouring data from another radiotherapist: radiotherapist β. The training cohort was used to optimize the convolution neural networks, which included the attention mechanism through the proposed activation module and the blended module into multiple MRI sequences, to perform autodelineation. The testing cohort was used to assess the networks' autodelineation performance. The contoured organs at risk (OAR) were the anal canal, bladder, rectum, femoral head (L), and femoral head (R).  Results:   We compared our proposed network with UNet and FuseUNet using our dataset. When T1 was the main sequence, we input three sequences to segment five organs and evaluated the results using four metrics: the DSC (Dice similarity coefficient), the JSC (Jaccard similarity coefficient), the ASD (average mean distance), and the 95% HD (robust Hausdorff distance). The proposed network achieved improved results compared with the baselines among all metrics. The DSC were 0.834±0.029, 0.818±0.037, and 0.808±0.050 for our proposed network, FuseUNet, and UNet, respectively. The 95% HD were 7.256±2.748 mm, 8.404±3.297 mm, and 8.951±4.798 mm for our proposed network, FuseUNet, and UNet, respectively. Our proposed network also had superior performance on the JSC and ASD coefficients.  Conclusion:   Our proposed activation module and blended module significantly improved the performance of FuseUNet for multi-sequence MRI segmentation. Our proposed network integrated multiple MRI sequences efficiently and autosegmented OAR rapidly and accurately. We also discovered that three-sequence fusion (T1-T1DIXONC-T2) was superior to two-sequence fusion (T1-T2 and T1-T1DIXONC, respectively). We infer that the more MRI sequences fused, the better the automatic segmentation results.""","""['Sijuan Huang', 'Zesen Cheng', 'Lijuan Lai', 'Wanjia Zheng', 'Mengxue He', 'Junyun Li', 'Tianyu Zeng', 'Xiaoyan Huang', 'Xin Yang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Machine Segmentation of Pelvic Anatomy in MRI-Assisted Radiosurgery (MARS) for Prostate Cancer Brachytherapy.', 'Fully automatic, multiorgan segmentation in normal whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), using classification forests (CFs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and a multi-atlas (MA) approach.', 'Automatic intraprostatic lesion segmentation in multiparametric magnetic resonance images with proposed multiple branch UNet.', 'ARPM-net: A novel CNN-based adversarial method with Markov random field enhancement for prostate and organs at risk segmentation in pelvic CT images.', 'Multi-task edge-recalibrated network for male pelvic multi-organ segmentation on CT images.', 'Automatic segmentation of the female pelvic floor muscles on MRI for pelvic floor function assessment.', 'Fully automated bladder tumor segmentation from T2 MRI images using 3D U-Net algorithm.']"""

All required assay reagents are pre-deposited on hydrophilic filter paper spots surrounded by a hydrophobic barrier. Sarcosine in the sample solution is selectively oxidized in the presence of sarcosine oxidase (SOx), resulting in the formation of hydrogen peroxide, which is subsequently detected through the horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-catalyzed conversion of the colorless indicator 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) into its blue-colored oxidation product. By the modification of the paper with positively charged poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH), a linear response to sarcosine between 0 and 10 μM and a significant lowering of the limit of detection (LOD) (0.6 μM) compared to the unmodified paper substrate (12.6 μM) has been achieved. The improvement of the LOD was attributed to the fact that the presence of the polymer limits the enzyme-driven colorimetric reaction to the surface of the paper substrate, resulting in stronger color development. In experiments in artificial urine matrix, the bicarbonate anion was identified as an inhibitor of the colorimetric reaction. This inhibition was successfully eliminated through on-device sample pH adjustments with pH-buffer components pre-deposited onto assay devices. The LOD for sarcosine achieved in artificial urine matrix (2.5 μM) is below the 5 μM threshold value for this urinary biomarker required for diagnostic purposes. Finally, good selectivity over all 20 natural amino acids and satisfactory long-term storage stability of reagent-modified paper substrates at - 20 °C for a period of 50 days were confirmed.""","""['Mayu Masumoto', 'Sera Ohta#', 'Misaki Nakagawa#', 'Yuki Hiruta', 'Daniel Citterio']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Anal Bioanal Chem""","""['A Rapid Method for the Detection of Sarcosine Using SPIONs/Au/CS/SOX/NPs for Prostate Cancer Sensing.', 'Development of sarcosine quantification in urine based on enzyme-coupled colorimetric method for prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Colorimetric determination of sarcosine in urine samples of prostatic carcinoma by mimic enzyme palladium nanoparticles.', 'Iron doped graphitic carbon nitride with peroxidase like activity for colorimetric detection of sarcosine and hydrogen peroxide.', 'Using bimetallic Au/Cu nanoplatelets for construction of facile and label-free inner filter effect-based photoluminescence sensing platform for sarcosine detection.', 'Point-of-care diagnostics for rapid determination of prostate cancer biomarker sarcosine: application of disposable potentiometric sensor based on oxide-conductive polymer nanocomposite.', 'Molecular-electromechanical system for unamplified detection of trace analytes in biofluids.', 'Semi-quantitative microfluidic paper-based analytical device for ionic silica detection.', 'Colorimetric Paper-Based Sensors against Cancer Biomarkers.']"""

Materials and methods:   Patients undergoing SBRT with SIB for biopsy-proven prostatic adenocarcinoma and a pre-radiation MRI were retrospectively reviewed. 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions was delivered to entire prostate along with SIB of 40 Gy to an MRI-defined intraprostatic lesion. Demographic, radiation planning details, and post-procedural outcomes were compared between patients undergoing systematic transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy followed by MRI to those undergoing an MRI followed by a FB prior to radiation planning.  Results:   Forty-three patients underwent systematic TRUS biopsy followed by MRI and 46 patients underwent FB prior to radiation planning. Patients undergoing systematic TRUS biopsy had a smaller prostate volume when compared to the FB cohort (37.58 ± 13.78 versus 50.28 ± 26.76 cc, p = 0.007). No differences in prostate planning target volume (PTVprostate) and boost volume (PTVboost) were noted, but those undergoing TRUS biopsy prior to MRI had a higher integrated boost volume density (IBVD = PTVboost/total prostate volume) (0.16 ± 0.09 versus 0.13 ± 0.06, p = 0.045). No differences were observed in genitourinary or gastrointestinal toxicity rates.

Seminal reports have presented evidence that tryptophan (Trp) metabolic reprogramming induced by aberrant indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenases could promote tumor development in several cancer types. However, the underlying mechanism of Trp metabolism associated tumor progression is not fully understood.  Materials and methods:   Prostatic cell lines LNCaP and VCaP were purchased from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (China). Human prostatic tumor tissue samples were obtained from the Tongji Hospital. Female NOD-SCID mice (6 ~ 8 weeks) were purchased from Huafukang Co. (China) and raised in SPF room. Commercial kits and instruments were used for cell apoptosis analysis, real-time PCR, western blotting, ELISA analysis and other experiments.  Result:   Comparing the tumor tissues from prostatic cancer patients, we found elevated expression of tryptophan 2, 3-dioxygenase 2 (TDO2), and elevated Trp metabolism in chemo-resistant tumor tissues. In vitro, overexpression of TDO2 significantly promoted the Trp metabolism in prostatic cancer cell lines LNCaP and VCap, resulting in the multidrug resistance development. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that Trp metabolite kynurenine (Kyn) promoted the upregulation and nuclear translocation of transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Subsequently, AhR collaborated with NF-κB to facilitate the activation of c-Myc. In turn, c-Myc promoted the up-regulation of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and Trp transporters, thereby contributing to chemoresistance and strengthened Trp metabolism in prostatic cancer. Interrupt of Trp/TDO2/Kyn/AhR/c-Myc loop with c-Myc inhibitor Mycro-3 efficiently suppressed the chemoresistance and improved the outcome of chemotherapy, which described a new strategy in clinical prostatic cancer treatment.  Conclusion:   Our study demonstrates that elevated TOD2 expression promoted Trp metabolism and metabolite Kyn production, thus resulting in the activation of AhR/c-Myc/ABC-SLC transporters signaling pathway. Interrupt of Trp metabolism/c-Myc loop efficiently suppressed the drugs resistance induced by TDO2, which represented potential target to improve the outcome in drug-resistant prostatic cancer treatment.""","""['Fan Li', 'Zhenyu Zhao', 'Zongbiao Zhang', 'Yan Zhang', 'Wei Guan']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Kynurenine produced by tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase metabolism promotes glioma progression through an aryl hydrocarbon receptor-dependent signaling pathway.', 'A TDO2-AhR signaling axis facilitates anoikis resistance and metastasis in triple-negative breast cancer.', 'TDO2 and tryptophan metabolites promote kynurenine/AhR signals to facilitate glioma progression and immunosuppression.', 'Reimagining IDO Pathway Inhibition in Cancer Immunotherapy via Downstream Focus on the Tryptophan-Kynurenine-Aryl Hydrocarbon Axis.', 'Targeting the IDO1/TDO2-KYN-AhR Pathway for Cancer Immunotherapy - Challenges and Opportunities.', 'Druggable Metabolic Vulnerabilities Are Exposed and Masked during Progression to Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Pancancer Analysis of Revealed TDO2 as a Biomarker of Prognosis and Immunotherapy.', 'The Kynurenine Pathway and Cancer: Why Keep It Simple When You Can Make It Complicated.']"""

Patients and methods:   We analysed 2446 biopsies: 2286 biopsies from a group of 254 patients with clinically organ-confined prostate cancer who underwent RP and 160 biopsies from a control group of 32 patients. After prostate gland excision, biopsies were obtained from defined areas of the prostatic fossa and bisected for histopathological and molecular genetics analyses. Results were related to clinicopathological data including tumour stage, lymph node status, resection status, tumour grading, initial PSA level, and biochemical recurrence.  Results:   In total, 34 patients (13.4%) had at least one core positive for the GSTP1 promoter hypermethylation, six of whom (17.6%) were characterised as having a clinically localised tumour stage (pT2, pN0) and 28 (82.4%) as an advanced tumour stage (≥pT3 and/or pN1).

Mutations in PIM1, especially in its kinase domain, can induce abnormal structural changes and thus alter functionalities that can lead to disease progression and other complexities. Herein, we have performed an extensive analysis of the PIM1 mutations at sequence and structure level while utilizing state-of-the-art computational approaches. Based on the impact on PIM1, numerous pathogenic and destabilizing mutations were identified and subsequently analyzed in detail. Finally, two amino acid substitutions (W109C and F147C) in the kinase domain of PIM1 were selected to explore their impact on the PIM1 structure in a time evolution manner using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for 200 ns. MD results indicate significant conformational altercations in the structure of PIM1, especially upon F147C mutation. This study provides a significant insight into the PIM1 dysfunction upon single amino acid substitutions, which can be utilized to get insights into the molecular basis of PIM1-associated disease progression.""","""['Alaa Shafie', 'Shama Khan', 'Sagar Batra', 'Farah Anjum', 'Taj Mohammad', 'Shoaib Alam', 'Dharmendra Kumar Yadav', 'Asimul Islam', 'Md Imtaiyaz Hassan']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Phytoconstituents and Medicinal Plants for Anticancer Drug Discovery: Computational Identification of Potent Inhibitors of PIM1 Kinase.', 'Phosphorylation of the androgen receptor by PIM1 in hormone refractory prostate cancer.', 'Using insights into Pim1 structure to design new anticancer drugs.', 'PIM1 kinase as a target in prostate cancer: roles in tumorigenesis, castration resistance, and docetaxel resistance.', 'PIM1 kinase as a target for cancer therapy.', 'Frustration analysis of TBK1 missense mutations reported in ALS/FTD and cancer patients.', 'Investigating the Mechanism of Inhibition of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6 Inhibitory Potential by Selonsertib: Newer Insights Into Drug Repurposing.', ""Impact of Single Amino Acid Substitutions in Parkinsonism-Associated Deglycase-PARK7 and Their Association with Parkinson's Disease.""]"""

The results of the study demonstrated that exposure to DON alone or in combination with DHEA had a stimulatory effect on the release of estradiol and testosterone and also affected progesterone secretion.

However, no controlled study has assessed the effects of E2 in the absence of testosterone.  Design:   Six-month randomized, placebo-controlled trial with the hypothesis that men randomized to E2 would reduce their fat mass.  Methods:   Seventy-eight participants receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer were randomized to 0.9 mg of 0.1% E2 gel per day, or matched placebo. Dual x-ray absorptiometry body composition was measured at baseline, month 3, and month 6. The primary outcome was total fat mass.  Results:   Serum E2 increased in the estradiol group over 6 months compared to placebo, and mean-adjusted difference (MAD) was 207 pmol/L (95% CI: 123-292), P < 0.001. E2 treatment changed total fat mass, MAD 1007 g (95% CI: 124-1891), but not significantly, so P = 0.09. There were other consistent non-significant trends toward increased proportional fat mass, MAD 0.8% (95% CI: 0.0-1.6), P= 0.15; gynoid fat, MAD 147 g (95% CI: 2-293), P = 0.08; visceral fat, 53 g (95% CI: 1-105) P = 0.13; and subcutaneous fat, MAD 65 g (95% CI: 5-125), P = 0.11. Android fat increased, MAD 164 g (95% CI: 41-286), P = 0.04.  Conclusion:   Contrary to our hypothesis, we provide suggestive evidence that E2 acting in the absence of testosterone, may increase total and regional fat mass in men. Given the premature closure of clinical trials due to the COVID pandemic, this potentially important observation should encourage additional studies to confirm or refute whether E2 promotes fat expansion in the absence of testosterone.""","""['Nicholas Russell', 'Rudolf Hoermann', 'Ada S Cheung', 'Jeffrey D Zajac', 'David J Handelsman', 'Mathis Grossmann']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur J Endocrinol""","""['Effects of estradiol on bone in men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy: a randomized placebo-controlled trial.', 'Effects of testosterone treatment on body fat and lean mass in obese men on a hypocaloric diet: a randomised controlled trial.', 'Time on androgen deprivation therapy and adaptations to exercise: secondary analysis from a 12-month randomized controlled trial in men with prostate cancer.', 'The clinical importance of quantifying body fat distribution during androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Estradiol for the mitigation of adverse effects of androgen deprivation therapy.']"""

However, the drug resistance mediated by O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) and absence of tumor-targeting ability largely decrease the antitumor efficacy of CENUs. In this study, we synthesized an azobenzene-based hypoxia-activated combi-nitrosourea prodrug, AzoBGNU, and evaluated its hypoxic selectivity and antitumor activity. The prodrug was composed of a CENU pharmacophore and an O6-benzylguanine (O6-BG) analog moiety masked by a N,N-dimethyl-4-(phenyldiazenyl)aniline segment as a hypoxia-activated trigger, which was designed to be selectively reduced via azo bond break in hypoxic tumor microenvironment, accompanied with releasing of an O6-BG analog to inhibit AGT and a chloroethylating agent to induce dG-dC ICLs. AzoBGNU exhibited significantly increased cytotoxicity and apoptosis-inducing ability toward DU145 cells under hypoxia compared with normoxia, indicating the hypoxia-responsiveness as expected. Predominant higher cytotoxicity was observed in the cells treated by AzoBGNU than those by traditional CENU chemotherapy ACNU and its combination with O6-BG. The levels of dG-dC ICLs in DU145 cells induced by AzoBGNU was remarkably enhanced under hypoxia, which was approximately 6-fold higher than those in the AzoBGNU-treated groups under normoxia and those in the ACNU-treated groups. The results demonstrated that azobenzene-based combi-nitrosourea prodrug possessed desirable tumor-hypoxia targeting ability and eliminated chemoresistance compared with the conventional CENUs.""","""['Qi Liu', 'Xiaoli Wang', 'Jun Li', 'Jiaojiao Wang', 'Guohui Sun', 'Na Zhang', 'Ting Ren', 'Lijiao Zhao', 'Rugang Zhong']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Biomed Pharmacother""","""['Synthesis and antitumor activity evaluation of a novel combi-nitrosourea prodrug: Designed to release a DNA cross-linking agent and an inhibitor of O(6)-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase.', 'NBGNU: a hypoxia-activated tripartite combi-nitrosourea prodrug overcoming AGT-mediated chemoresistance.', 'Synthesis and Antitumor Activity Evaluation of a Novel Combi-nitrosourea Prodrug: BGCNU.', 'Inactivation of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase as a means to enhance chemotherapy.', 'DNA binding, nucleotide flipping, and the helix-turn-helix motif in base repair by O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase and its implications for cancer chemotherapy.', 'The effect of Azo-dyes on glioblastoma cells in vitro.']"""

International and national Health agencies recommend avoiding sun exposure when the solar rays are strongest (typically 2 h before and after solar noon). In this study we detail and refine such recommendations. We estimated biologically-effective radiation (inductive of erythema and pre-vitamin D) using spectral solar UV radiation measurements on a horizontal plane at three French sites equipped with spectroradiometers: Villeneuve d'Ascq (VDA) (North of France); Observatoire de Haute-Provence (OHP) (French Southern Alps); and Saint-Denis de La Réunion (SDR) on Réunion Island, in the Indian Ocean. These sites are very different: VDA is a semi-urban site in a flat region, OHP a rural mountainous site and SDR a coastal urban site on a small mountainous island. Biologically active radiation was analyzed by studying erythema induction and measuring pre-vitamin D synthesis. Dose-rates, doses and times for sunburn induction and vitamin D production were derived. Regarding the level of vitamin D dose considered here (1000 IU), we found that at mainland sites time required for vitamin D synthesis was relatively long, even around solar noon, in winter months this could be 2-3 h for phototype II individuals exposing their face and hands. In the tropics vitamin D could always be synthesized in a reasonable time (e.g. 20 min in winter). By contrast, in summer, the required duration times (exposing face, hands, arms and legs) are very short, approximately 2-4 min on the mainland and 1 min in the tropics for phototype II individuals. In all skin phototypes the duration of sun exposure required to induce erythema was generally longer than that to produce vitamin D. These quantitative results, obtained using an instrument measuring on a horizontal plane and with an unobstructed view, do not represent realistic values for human exposure. To account for realistic human body exposure, received doses and times of exposure were adjusted. Our study shows that, mostly in summer, the time periods where limited solar exposure is recommended should be extended, especially at low latitude locations.""","""['Colette Brogniez', 'Jean-François Doré', 'Frédérique Auriol', 'Pierre Cesarini', 'Fanny Minvielle', 'Christine Deroo', 'Maxime Catalfamo', 'Jean-Marc Metzger', 'Pierre Da Conceicao']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Photochem Photobiol B""","""['Availability of vitamin D photoconversion weighted UV radiation in southern South America.', 'Estimates of beneficial and harmful sun exposure times during the year for major Australian population centres.', 'Solar ultraviolet doses and vitamin D in a northern mid-latitude.', 'Ultraviolet Exposure Scenarios: Balancing Risks of Erythema and Benefits of Cutaneous Vitamin D Synthesis.', 'Lessons Learned from Paleolithic Models and Evolution for Human Health: A Snap Shot on Beneficial Effects and Risks of Solar Radiation.']"""

Data are emerging that pathogenic variants in mismatch repair genes increase the risk of early-onset aggressive prostate cancer. The IMPACT study is prospectively assessing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in men with germline mismatch repair pathogenic variants. Here, we report the usefulness of PSA screening, prostate cancer incidence, and tumour characteristics after the first screening round in men with and without these germline pathogenic variants.  Methods:   The IMPACT study is an international, prospective study. Men aged 40-69 years without a previous prostate cancer diagnosis and with a known germline pathogenic variant in the MLH1, MSH2, or MSH6 gene, and age-matched male controls who tested negative for a familial pathogenic variant in these genes were recruited from 34 genetic and urology clinics in eight countries, and underwent a baseline PSA screening. Men who had a PSA level higher than 3·0 ng/mL were offered a transrectal, ultrasound-guided, prostate biopsy and a histopathological analysis was done. All participants are undergoing a minimum of 5 years' annual screening. The primary endpoint was to determine the incidence, stage, and pathology of screening-detected prostate cancer in carriers of pathogenic variants compared with non-carrier controls. We used Fisher's exact test to compare the number of cases, cancer incidence, and positive predictive values of the PSA cutoff and biopsy between carriers and non-carriers and the differences between disease types (ie, cancer vs no cancer, clinically significant cancer vs no cancer). We assessed screening outcomes and tumour characteristics by pathogenic variant status. Here we present results from the first round of PSA screening in the IMPACT study. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00261456, and is now closed to accrual.  Findings:   Between Sept 28, 2012, and March 1, 2020, 828 men were recruited (644 carriers of mismatch repair pathogenic variants [204 carriers of MLH1, 305 carriers of MSH2, and 135 carriers of MSH6] and 184 non-carrier controls [65 non-carriers of MLH1, 76 non-carriers of MSH2, and 43 non-carriers of MSH6]), and in order to boost the sample size for the non-carrier control groups, we randomly selected 134 non-carriers from the BRCA1 and BRCA2 cohort of the IMPACT study, who were included in all three non-carrier cohorts. Men were predominantly of European ancestry (899 [93%] of 953 with available data), with a mean age of 52·8 years (SD 8·3). Within the first screening round, 56 (6%) men had a PSA concentration of more than 3·0 ng/mL and 35 (4%) biopsies were done. The overall incidence of prostate cancer was 1·9% (18 of 962; 95% CI 1·1-2·9). The incidence among MSH2 carriers was 4·3% (13 of 305; 95% CI 2·3-7·2), MSH2 non-carrier controls was 0·5% (one of 210; 0·0-2·6), MSH6 carriers was 3·0% (four of 135; 0·8-7·4), and none were detected among the MLH1 carriers, MLH1 non-carrier controls, and MSH6 non-carrier controls. Prostate cancer incidence, using a PSA threshold of higher than 3·0 ng/mL, was higher in MSH2 carriers than in MSH2 non-carrier controls (4·3% vs 0·5%; p=0·011) and MSH6 carriers than MSH6 non-carrier controls (3·0% vs 0%; p=0·034). The overall positive predictive value of biopsy using a PSA threshold of 3·0 ng/mL was 51·4% (95% CI 34·0-68·6), and the overall positive predictive value of a PSA threshold of 3·0 ng/mL was 32·1% (20·3-46·0).  Interpretation:   After the first screening round, carriers of MSH2 and MSH6 pathogenic variants had a higher incidence of prostate cancer compared with age-matched non-carrier controls. These findings support the use of targeted PSA screening in these men to identify those with clinically significant prostate cancer. Further annual screening rounds will need to confirm these findings.

Objective:   This study explored whether YTHDF1 could regulate TRIM44 in PCa cells.  Methods:   By querying the TCGA database, we evaluated YTHDF1 expression in PCa, the OS and DFS of YTHDF1, and the correlation between YTHDF1 and TRIM44 in PCa. We constructed vectors to interfere with YTHDF1 expression and overexpress TRIM44 to examine the role of YTHDF1 and TRIM44 in PCa cells. Differentially expressed mRNAs were identified by mRNA sequencing. The levels of YTHDF1, TRIM44, LGR4, SGTA, DDX20, and FZD8 were measured by qRT-PCR and WB was used to determine YTHDF1 and TRIM44 expression. A CCK-8 assay was used to assess cell proliferation. A Transwell chamber assay was used measure cell migration and invasion ability.  Results:   YTHDF1 was highly expressed in both Pca tissues and cells. PCa patient prognosis with high YTHDF1 expression was relatively poor. Cell function experiments showed that inhibiting YTHDF1 expression decreased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that YTHDF1 may promote PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by modulating TRIM44 expression.

Materials and methods:   From November 2014 to December 2019, 172 low-risk patients had ET (nmol/L) measured. ETD, prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD) and the ratio of percentage of biopsy positive cores (BPC) to prostate volume (PV), defined as BPC density (BPCD), were evaluated. Associations with tumor upgrading in the surgical specimen were assessed by statistical methods.  Results:   Overall, 121 patients (70.3%) had tumor upgrading, which was predicted by BPCD (odds ratio, OR = 4.640; 95% CI 1.903-11.316; p = 0.001; overall accuracy: 70.3%). On multivariate analysis, tumor upgrading and clinical density factors related to each other for BPCD being predicted by ETD (regression coefficient, b = 0.032; 95% CI 0.021-0.043; p < 0.0001), PSAD (b = 1.962; 95% CI 1.067-2.586; p < 0.0001) and tumor upgrading (b = 0.259; 95% CI 0.112-0.406; p = 0.001).

Methods:   The dataset of 194 men was split into training (n = 135) and internal validation (n = 59) cohorts, and a temporal dataset (n = 58) was used for evaluation. The lesions with Gleason score ≥ 7 were defined as csPC. Logistic regression (LR), stepwise regression (SR), classical decision tree (cDT), conditional inference tree (CIT), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) models were established by combining mpMRI-TA, DCE-MRI and clinical parameters and validated by internal and temporal validation using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Delong's method.  Results:   Eight variables were determined as important predictors for csPC, with the first three related to texture features derived from the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping. RF, LR and SR models yielded larger and more stable area under the ROC curve values (AUCs) than other models. In the temporal validation, the sensitivity was lower than that of the internal validation (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and AUC (p > 0.05).  Conclusions:   Each machine learning model in this study has good classification ability for csPC. Compared with internal validation, the sensitivity of each machine learning model in temporal validation was reduced, but the specificity, accuracy, PPV, NPV and AUCs remained stable at a good level. The RF, LR and SR models have better classification performance in the imaging-based diagnosis of csPC, and ADC texture-related parameters are of the highest importance.""","""['Tao Peng', 'JianMing Xiao', 'Lin Li', 'BingJie Pu', 'XiangKe Niu', 'XiaoHui Zeng', 'ZongYong Wang', 'ChaoBang Gao', 'Ci Li', 'Lin Chen', 'Jin Yang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg""","""['Diagnostic Performance Evaluation of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in the Detection of Prostate Cancer with Supervised Machine Learning Methods.', 'Transition zone prostate cancer: Logistic regression and machine-learning models of quantitative ADC, shape and texture features are highly accurate for diagnosis.', 'Impact of Machine Learning With Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Breast for Early Prediction of Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy and Survival Outcomes in Breast Cancer Patients.', 'Bi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging based radiomics for the identification of benign and malignant prostate lesions: cross-vendor validation.', 'Comparison of biparametric and multiparametric MRI in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Diagnostic Performance Evaluation of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in the Detection of Prostate Cancer with Supervised Machine Learning Methods.', 'Biparametric MRI-based radiomics classifiers for the detection of prostate cancer in patients with PSA serum levels of 4∼10 ng/mL.', 'More than Meets the Eye: Using Textural Analysis and Artificial Intelligence as Decision Support Tools in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis-A Systematic Review.', 'Prediction of Atrial Fibrillation in Hospitalized Elderly Patients With Coronary Heart Disease and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Using Machine Learning: A Multicenter Retrospective Study.']"""

Materials and methods:   A total of 541 patients with localized, intermediate-risk prostate cancer underwent low-dose rate brachytherapy with iodine-125 seeds with or without supplemental external beam radiotherapy in combination. Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy was administered to 273 patients (50.5%) with a median duration of 3 months (range 1-108 months). PSA bounce was defined as ≥ 0.2 ng/ml increase above the interval PSA nadir, followed by a decrease below that value.  Results:   The median age was 69 years (range 49-90 years). The median follow-up duration was 102 months (range 36-205 months). One-hundred and fifty patients (27.7%) had PSA bounce with a median magnitude of 0.47 ng/ml (range 0.2-3.19 ng/ml).

The Veterans Health Administration focuses on improving the value and quality of care, using a patient-centered medical home model that may affect cancer screening behavior.  Objective:   To understand rates and factors associated with outpatient low-value cancer screenings.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cohort study assessed the receipt of low-value cancer screening and associated factors among 5 993 010 veterans. Four measures of low-value cancer screening defined by validated recommendations of practices to avoid were constructed using administrative data. Patients with cancer screenings in 2017 at Veterans Health Administration primary care clinics were included. Excluded patients had recent symptoms or historic high-risk diagnoses that may affect test appropriateness (eg, melena preceding colonoscopy). Data were analyzed from December 23, 2019, to June 21, 2021.  Exposures:   Receipt of cancer screening test.  Main outcomes and measures:   Low-value screenings were defined as occurring for average-risk patients outside of guideline-recommended ages or if the 1-year mortality risk estimated using a previously validated score was at least 50%. Factors evaluated in multivariable regression models included patient, clinician, and clinic characteristics and patient-centered medical home domain performance for team-based care, access, and continuity previously developed from administrative and survey data.  Results:   Of 5 993 010 veterans (mean [SD] age, 63.1 [16.8] years; 5 496 976 men [91.7%]; 1 027 836 non-Hispanic Black [17.2%] and 4 539 341 non-Hispanic White [75.7%] race and ethnicity) enrolled in primary care, 903 612 of 4 647 479 men of average risk (19.4%) underwent prostate cancer screening; 299 765 of 5 770 622 patients of average risk (5.2%) underwent colorectal cancer screening; 21 930 of 469 045 women of average risk (4.7%) underwent breast cancer screening; and 65 511 of 458 086 women of average risk (14.3%) underwent cervical cancer screening. Of patients screened, low-value testing was rare for 3 cancers, with receipt of a low-value test in 633 of 21 930 of women screened for breast cancer (2.9%), 630 of 65 511 of women screened for cervical cancer (1.0%), and 6790 of 299 765 of patients screened for colorectal cancer (2.3%). However, 350 705 of 4 647 479 of screened men (7.5%) received a low-value prostate cancer test. Patient race and ethnicity, sociodemographic factors, and illness burden were significantly associated with likelihood of receipt of low-value tests among screened patients. No single patient-, clinician-, or clinic-level factor explained the receipt of a low-value test across cancer screening cohorts.  Conclusions and relevance:   This large cohort study found that low-value breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screenings were rare in the Veterans Health Administration, but more than one-third of patients screened for prostate cancer were tested outside of clinical practice guidelines.

Objective:   To use electronic health record and administrative claims data to emulate the ongoing PRONOUNCE trial (A Trial Comparing Cardiovascular Safety of Degarelix Versus Leuprolide in Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease).  Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective, propensity-matched cohort study included adult men with a diagnosis of prostate cancer and cardiovascular disease who initiated either degarelix or leuprolide between December 24, 2008, and June 30, 2019. Participants were commercially insured individuals and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries included in a large US administrative claims database.  Exposures:   Degarelix or leuprolide.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary end point was time to first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE), defined as death due to any cause, myocardial infarction, or stroke, analogous to the PRONOUNCE trial. Secondary end points were time to death due to any cause, myocardial infarction, stroke, and angina. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate primary and secondary end points.  Results:   A total of 32 172 men initiated degarelix or leuprolide for prostate cancer; of them, 9490 (29.5%) had cardiovascular disease, and 7800 (24.2%) met the PRONOUNCE trial eligibility criteria and were included in this study.

Methods:   We retrospectively selected a total of 100 patients, who were consecutively examined in our department, with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy or who had progressive local and possible metastatic disease in the last 3 months prior to this investigation. All patients were examined with a dedicated PET-CT scanner (Biograph; Siemens Healthineers). A total of 250 MBq (3.5 MBq per kg bodyweight, range 230-290 MBq) of [64Cu]-DOTAGA-PSMA or [18-F]-PSMA was applied intravenously. PET images were performed 1 h post-injection (skull base to mid-thigh). The maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of PSMA-positive lesions and the mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean) of the right liver lobe were measured.  Results:   All but 9/50 of the patients (18%; PSA range: 0.01-0.7 µg/L) studied with [64Cu]-DOTAGA-PSMA and 6/50 of the ones (12%; PSA range: 0.01-4.2) studied with [18F]-PSMA had at least one positive PSMA lesion shown by PET-CT. The total number of lesions was higher with [64Cu]-DOTAGA-PSMA (209 vs. 191); however, the median number of lesions was one for [64Cu]-DOTAGA-PSMA and two for [18F]-PSMA. Interestingly, the median SUVmean of the right liver lobe was slightly higher for [18F]-PSMA (11.8 vs. 8.9).  Conclusions:   [64Cu]-DOTAGA-PSMA and [18F]-PSMA have comparable detection rates for the assessment of residual disease in patients with recurrent or primary progressive prostate cancer.

These findings are not surprising when the side effects of highly effective current treatment modalities are considered. Here, we assess the association between urinary function and quality of life indicators to mental disorder among survivors of PCa. This is a cross sectional examination of an analytical sample of 362 men with a history of PCa residing in the Maritimes who took a survey assessing social, physical and health-related quality of life indicators between 2017 and 2021. Mental disorder was assessed using Kessler's Psychological Distress Scale (K-10). Predictor variables included emotional, functional, social/family and spiritual well-being, measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P), and urinary function was measured by International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Multivariate logistic regression analysis evaluated the contribution of predictors while controlling for age, income, survivorship time (months) since diagnosis, relationship status and treatment modality. Mental disorder was identified among 15.8% of PCa survivors in this sample. High emotional (aOR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.69-0.96) and spiritual well-being (aOR = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.81-0.96) were protective factors against mental disorder. Men who screened positive for moderate to severe urinary tract symptoms had three times higher odds (aOR = 3.02, 95% CI: 1.10, 8.32) of screening positive for mental disorder.

Unmet emotional and spiritual needs, increased urinary problems and some forms of treatment (e.g., active surveillance or surgery) were associated with mental disorder among PCa survivors.

This study reports on a cohort of 54 elderly (>70 years) patients that received 4000-5000 cGy of palliative external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) as an alternative to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The primary outcome of interest was the period of ADT-free survival, and secondary outcomes included overall survival (OS) and metastases-free survival (MFS). Kaplan-Meier regression was used to estimate survival outcomes. Thirty-six (67%) patients achieved a break in ADT post-radiotherapy, with a median time to ADT reinitiation of 20 months. Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) were limited to low-grade gastrointestinal (GI) or genitourinary (GU) toxicities, with no skin toxicities observed. Grade 1 GI toxicity was observed in 9 (17%) patients, and grades 1 and 2 GU toxicities were observed in 13 (24%) and 3 (6%) patients, respectively, with no higher-grade toxicities reported. Five-year MFS and OS were 56% and 78%, respectively. In summary, the treatment regimen was well-tolerated and achieved durable ADT-free survival in most patients.

Several studies have shown that only high-level focal MET amp (MET/CEP7 ratio ≥5) is oncogenic, with such tumors responding to targeted therapy. However, there are few reports on how to distinguish between focal amplification and aneuploidy using next-generation sequencing (NGS). A total of 1025 patients with advanced solid tumors (typically pre-treated) were tested with a non-invasive comprehensive cfDNA NGS panel (Guardant360) from July 2014 to June 2019. Since bioinformatics upgrades of Guardant360 were undergoing in September 2018, focal MET amp was determined by our independent algorithm using the cohorts tested before September 2018 (291 patients), and validation was performed in the remaining cohort (734 patients). MET alterations (alts) associated with aberrant signaling were found in 110 patients (10.7%) among nine different cancer types, most commonly in non-small cell (12.2%, 62/510) and small cell (33.3%, 3/9) lung cancers, gastroesophageal cancer (19.4%, 7/36), and prostate adenocarcinoma (15.6%; 5/32). Among 291 patients tested before September 2018, 37 (12.7%) had MET alts. Among these, 24 (64.9%) had amps, 5 (13.5%) had exon 14 skipping, and 13 (35.1%) had single nucleotide variants (SNVs). Co-alterations, such as amp + SNVs, were found in four samples (10.8%). Among 24 MET amps, 29.2% (7/24) were focal according to our algorithm. MET copy number was significantly higher with focal amp compared to non-focal amp (mean copy number 3.26 vs. 2.44, respectively, p = 0.00304). In 734 patients tested after September 2018, our definition of focal MET amp was detected in 4.2% (31/734). Overall, focal amplification based on our algorithm was 3.7% (=38/1025). This study describes an approach to distinguish focal and non-focal MET amplification using comprehensive genomic profiling of cfDNA in advanced cancer patients. Focal MET amp accounted for ~30% of all MET amp, which was found in 3.7% of patients with diverse cancers and was associated with a higher plasma copy number.

Temporal changes in Pca incidence and mortality have not been reported despite changes in the Pca landscape. This study aims to analyse the temporal trends in Pca with focus on ethnic and regional variations.  Methods:   The study cohort was identified from the NZ Cancer Registry and the mortality collection databases. Men who were diagnosed with Pca between 2000 and 2018 were included in the incidence analysis. Men who died from Pca between 2000 and 2015 were included in the mortality analysis. Other data collected were ethnicity and geographical information. Pca incidence and mortality were calculated as age-standardized rates using the 2001 World Health Organization population.  Results:   A total of 58 966 men were diagnosed (incidence: 105.2 per 100 000) and 14 749 men died (mortality: 49.3 per 100 000) from Pca. When compared to European men, Māori and Asian men had significantly lower Pca incidence. Mortality rates demonstrated a steady decline, which was more prominent until 2010. Māori and Pacific men had higher mortality rates when compared to European men. In most recent years, the difference in mortality is decreasing for Māori but increasing for Pacific men. There were no regional differences in mortality.  Conclusion:   Pca incidence in NZ has fluctuated over the last 20 years, while mortality rates have shown to steadily decline.

These tumors undergo epigenetic reprogramming turning castration-resistant prostate cancer adenocarcinoma (CRPC-Adeno) into neuroendocrine prostate cancer (CRPC-NEPC). No targeted therapies are available for CRPC-NEPCs, and there are minimal organoid models to discover new therapeutic targets against these aggressive tumors. Here, using a combination of patient tumor proteomics, RNA sequencing, spatial-omics, and a synthetic hydrogel-based organoid, putative extracellular matrix (ECM) cues that regulate the phenotypic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic underpinnings of CRPC-NEPCs are defined. Short-term culture in tumor-expressed ECM differentially regulated DNA methylation and mobilized genes in CRPC-NEPCs. The ECM type distinctly regulates the response to small-molecule inhibitors of epigenetic targets and Dopamine Receptor D2 (DRD2), the latter being an understudied target in neuroendocrine tumors. In vivo patient-derived xenograft in immunocompromised mice showed strong anti-tumor response when treated with a DRD2 inhibitor. Finally, we demonstrate that therapeutic response in CRPC-NEPCs under drug-resistant ECM conditions can be overcome by first cellular reprogramming with epigenetic inhibitors, followed by DRD2 treatment. The synthetic organoids suggest the regulatory role of ECM in therapeutic response to targeted therapies in CRPC-NEPCs and enable the discovery of therapies to overcome resistance.""","""['Matthew J Mosquera', 'Sungwoong Kim', 'Rohan Bareja', 'Zhou Fang', 'Shuangyi Cai', 'Heng Pan', 'Muhammad Asad', 'Maria Laura Martin', 'Michael Sigouros', 'Florencia M Rowdo', 'Sarah Ackermann', 'Jared Capuano', 'Jacob Bernheim', 'Cynthia Cheung', 'Ashley Doane', 'Nicholas Brady', 'Richa Singh', 'David S Rickman', 'Varun Prabhu', 'Joshua E Allen', 'Loredana Puca', 'Ahmet F Coskun', 'Mark A Rubin', 'Himisha Beltran', 'Juan Miguel Mosquera', 'Olivier Elemento', 'Ankur Singh']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Adv Mater""","""['Epigenetic Reprogramming with Antisense Oligonucleotides Enhances the Effectiveness of Androgen Receptor Inhibition in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Inhibition of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Combination of carmustine and selenite effectively inhibits tumor growth by targeting androgen receptor, androgen receptor-variants, and Akt in preclinical models: New hope for patients with castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Enzalutamide: targeting the androgen signalling pathway in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The heterogeneity of prostate cancers lacking AR activity will require diverse treatment approaches.', 'Organoids: The current status and biomedical applications.', 'Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement of Animal Experiments in Anticancer Drug Development: The Contribution of 3D In Vitro Cancer Models in the Drug Efficacy Assessment.', 'Tumor-on-a-chip: Perfusable vascular incorporation brings new approach to tumor metastasis research and drug development.', 'Preclinical Models of Neuroendocrine Neoplasia.', 'Exploring anti-androgen therapies in hormone dependent prostate cancer and new therapeutic routes for castration resistant prostate cancer.']"""

While providing a reliable and valid measure of PCs, research thus far has not clarified whether PCs change across time and/or through intervention. This study asks whether PCs change during oncological inpatient rehabilitation and beyond.  Methods:   N = 377 breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer patients from clinics for oncological rehabilitation were included to complete self-report measures of PC, coping and self-efficacy for coping with cancer at the beginning and the end of rehabilitation and 9 months afterward. In order to determine differences between tumor diagnostic groups and changes across time 3 (tumor site) x 3 (time) repeated measures analyses of variance were computed.  Results:   Tumor diagnostic groups differed only marginally in PCs, coping self-efficacy and coping. The PCs of self-regulation and managing distress and coping self-efficacy improved slightly during rehabilitation but returned to initial levels at 9 months. Differential improvement was evident in the competencies of seeking information and interest in social services. Two of five coping behaviors decreased markedly from the end of rehabilitation to follow-up.  Conclusions:   This study suggests that oncological inpatient rehabilitation may contribute to advancing PCs, albeit to a limited extent. Aside from addressing conceptual, diagnostic and measurement issues, future research should clarify which interventions may be most effective for advancing problem- and emotion-focused PCs.""","""['Juergen M Giesler', 'Joachim Weis', 'Reiner Caspari', 'Timm Dauelsberg', 'Wilfried Hoffmann', 'Jürgen Körber', 'Hans-Helge Bartsch']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Psychooncology""","""['Patient competence in the context of cancer: its dimensions and their relationships with coping, coping self-efficacy, fear of progression, and depression.', 'Coping and its importance for quality of life in patients with multiple sclerosis.', 'Pilot evaluation of a coping-oriented supportive program for people with spinal cord injury during inpatient rehabilitation.', 'A meta-analytic review of the relationship of cancer coping self-efficacy with distress and quality of life.', ""Recent research in stress, coping and women's health.""]"""

Therefore, we evaluated the biological activities of this plant to define its effects against prostate cancer (PCa), Alzheimer's disease (AD), oxidation, and diabetes mellitus (DM) as well as identified its phenolic composition. To determine the anti-cancer properties of the plant extract, we treated PCa cells with the extract at a concentration range of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mg/ml. Significant results were obtained against the PC3 cells compared to normal PNT1a prostate epithelial cells. As a result of precise measurements at the millimolar level, it was observed that the plant extract showed an effective inhibition (IC50 ) against glutathione S-transferase (GST; 12.84 mM), acetyl cholinesterase (AChE; 15.07 mM), and α-Gly (11.75 mM) enzymes when compared with standard inhibitors. Antioxidant activities of DCM methanol extract were determined via two well-known in vitro techniques. The extracts showed antioxidant activities against the DPPH and ABTS+ . The LC-ESI-MS/MS was used to determine the phenolic compounds of methanol extract from DCM. Chlorogenic acid (2,089.096 µg/g), shikimic acid (193.14 µg/g), and coumarin (113.604 µg/g) were characterized as major phenolic compounds. In addition, the interactions of chlorogenic acid, chrysin, coumarin, and shikimic acid with the used three enzymes have been calculated using molecular docking simulation. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Plant natural phenolic compounds have protective effects such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticarcinogen, and enzyme inhibitory. Therefore, it has an important place in the food and pharmaceutical industry. The present study aims to reveal the enzyme inhibitory, antioxidant, and anticarcinogenic properties of the Daucus carota ssp. Major (DCM) plant extract. Significant results were obtained against the PC3 cells compared to normal PNT1a prostate epithelial cells. DCM extract demonstrated considerable antioxidant activity and inhibitory potential on used metabolic enzymes.

Abnormal expression of STS causes several diseases including colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer and refractory skin disease. In particular, accumulation of intracellular cholesterol sulfate by STS deficiency leads to a skin disorder with abnormal keratinization called X-linked ichthyosis (XLI). To determine the detailed mechanisms of XLI, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis using human keratinocyte HaCaT cells treated with cholesterol and cholesterol sulfate. Of the genes with expression changes greater than 1.5-fold, Yippee-like 3 (YPEL3), a factor expected to affect cell differentiation, was found. Induction of YPEL3 causes permanent growth arrest, cellular senescence, and inhibition of metastasis in normal and tumor cells. In this study, we demonstrate that YPEL3 expression was induced by STS deficiency and, using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, a partial knock-out (STS+/-) cell line was constructed to establish a disease model for XLI studies. Furthermore, we show that increased expression of YPEL3 in STS-deficient cell lines promoted cellular senescence and expression of keratinization-related proteins such as involucrin and loricrin.

Active surveillance subpopulation of patients with prostate cancer includes men with varying cancer risk categories of precancerous disease due to prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) heterogeneity. Identifying molecular alterations associated with PIN can provide preventable measures through finding novel pharmacologic targets for cancer interception. Targeted nutritional interception may prove to be the most appropriate chemoprevention for intermediate- and high-risk active surveillance patients. Here, we have generated two prostate-specific transgenic mouse models, one overexpressing MTA1 (R26MTA1 ) and the other overexpressing MTA1 on the background of Pten heterozygosity (R26MTA1 ; Pten+/f ), in which we examined the potential chemopreventive efficacy of dietary pterostilbene. We show that MTA1 promotes neoplastic transformation of prostate epithelial cells by activating cell proliferation and survival, leading to PIN development. Moreover, MTA1 cooperates with PTEN deficiency to accelerate PIN development by increasing cell proliferation and MTA1-associated signaling. Further, we show that mice fed with a pterostilbene-supplemented diet exhibited more favorable histopathology with decreased severity and number of PIN foci accompanied by reduced proliferation, angiogenesis, and inflammation concomitant to reduction in MTA1 and MTA1-associated CyclinD1, Notch2, and oncogenic miR-34a and miR-22 levels. PREVENTION RELEVANCE: Developing novel interceptive strategies for prostate cancer chemoprevention is a paramount goal in clinical oncology. We offer preclinical evidence for the potential of pterostilbene as a promising natural agent for MTA1-targeted interceptive strategy in future cancer prevention trials towards protecting select patients with prostate cancer under active surveillance from developing cancer.""","""['Rutu Hemani', 'Ishani Patel', 'Ninad Inamdar', 'Gisella Campanelli', 'Virginia Donovan', 'Avinash Kumar', 'Anait S Levenson']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Prev Res (Phila)""","""['Gnetin C Intercepts MTA1-Associated Neoplastic Progression in Prostate Cancer.', 'Dietary stilbenes as modulators of specific miRNAs in prostate cancer.', 'Dietary pterostilbene is a novel MTA1-targeted chemopreventive and therapeutic agent in prostate cancer.', 'Targeting MTA1/HIF-1α signaling by pterostilbene in combination with histone deacetylase inhibitor attenuates prostate cancer progression.', 'Metastasis-associated protein 1-mediated antitumor and anticancer activity of dietary stilbenes for prostate cancer chemoprevention and therapy.', 'Advances in mitophagy and mitochondrial apoptosis pathway-related drugs in glioblastoma treatment.', 'An Immunocompetent Environment Unravels the Proto-Oncogenic Role of miR-22.', 'Gnetin C Intercepts MTA1-Associated Neoplastic Progression in Prostate Cancer.', 'Dietary stilbenes as modulators of specific miRNAs in prostate cancer.']"""

Therefore, this study is designed to assess the efficacy and treatment-related toxicity of hypofractionated salvage radiotherapy for the treatment of biochemical recurrence in men who underwent radical prostatectomy. The primary objective of this trial is to investigate whether hypofractionated radiotherapy improves biochemical control compared with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. In addition, treatment-related toxicity, quality of life, and survival will be evaluated as secondary endpoints.  Methods:   In this prospective, randomized, multi-institutional trial (the SHARE study), patients with intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer will be randomized to receive either hypofractionated radiotherapy (65 Gy in 2.5-Gy fractions) or conventionally fractionated radiotherapy (66 Gy in 2-Gy fractions). Prostate bed irradiation or elective pelvic nodal irradiation including the prostate bed will be performed using intensity-modulated radiotherapy and daily image guidance. Treatment efficacy will be assessed using the serum tumor marker prostate-specific antigen, and toxicity will be evaluated through both physician- and patient-reported outcomes. Quality of life will also be investigated.  Discussion:   This study is designed to demonstrate whether hypofractionated radiotherapy is beneficial in terms of biochemical control and toxicity compared with standard salvage radiotherapy. If hypofractionated radiotherapy is shown to be superior to conventionally fractionated radiotherapy, it will mean that improved biochemical control can be achieved, accompanied by greater patient convenience and more efficient use of medical resources.

However, low potency, low selectivity, and serious side effects limit its druggability. L-Tryptophan is an essential precursor molecule of an anti-cancer active substance. Also, the indole moiety inhibits the proliferation of tumor cells by binding to colchicine sites. A decrease in kidney cell activity caused by kidney inflammation is the primary side effect of cancer therapy.  Objective:   The purpose of this work was to design, synthesize, and perform bioactivity evaluation of novel chalcone derivatives possessing tryptophan moiety with dual activities of anti-cancer and partially restoring the proliferation of normal kidney cells pre-treated with cisplatin.  Methods:   A series of novel chalcone derivatives possessing tryptophan moiety (5a-5g, 6a-6o) were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for anti-cancer activity against four cancer cell lines (gastric (HGC-27), colon (HCT-116), prostate (PC-3), and lung (A549)), and a human normal cell line (gastric mucosal epithelial (GES-1)). The activity of restoring the proliferation of normal kidney cells pre-treated with cisplatin was evaluated by MTT assay. Cell cycle, apoptosis, and apoptosis proteins (Bax and Bcl-2) were used to evaluate the anti-cancer mechanism of the most potent compound. Moreover, a docking study was performed to explain the high anti-cancer activity of 6n. The expressions of TNF-α, IL- 6, and MCP-1 were detected by ELISA.  Results:   Most of the compounds exhibited high anti-cancer activity against the HGC-27 cell line and exhibited low toxicity against the normal cell line. Based on three rounds of a structure optimization, 6n was discovered as the most potent compound against HGC-27 cells with an IC50 value of 2.02 μM and an SI value of 28.47. Further studies demonstrated that 6n could induce cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and the apoptosis of the HGC-27 cell line by reducing the expression of Bcl-2 and improving the expression level of Bax. Molecular docking result displayed 6n bound to the colchicine site. At the same time, 6n also exhibited moderate activity of restoring the proliferation of normal kidney cells pre-treated with cisplatin by reducing the expression of inflammatory substances.  Conclusion:   Our findings collectively suggested that 6n should be further studied as a potential anti-cancer agent that could partially restore the proliferation of normal kidney cells pre-treated with cisplatin in gastric cancer patients by an anti-inflammatory pathway.""","""['Meng He', 'Mingjun Yu', 'Chao Li', 'Xiaoming Meng', 'Jiamin Su', 'Yuting Zhu', 'Risheng Yao']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Anticancer Agents Med Chem""","""['Design, synthesis, and molecular docking of novel pyrazole-chalcone analogs of lonazolac as 5-LOX, iNOS and tubulin polymerization inhibitors with potential anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities.', 'Molecular Docking Study, Cytotoxicity, Cell Cycle Arrest and Apoptotic Induction of Novel Chalcones Incorporating Thiadiazolyl Isoquinoline in Cervical Cancer.', 'Novel 3-(2,6,9-trisubstituted-9H-purine)-8-chalcone derivatives as potent anti-gastric cancer agents: Design, synthesis and structural optimization.', '2-Anilinopyrimidine derivatives: Design, synthesis, in vitro anti-proliferative activity, EGFR and ARO inhibitory activity, cell cycle analysis and molecular docking study.', 'Recent Progresses in Chalcone Derivatives as Potential Anticancer Agents.']"""

FOXD1-AS1 presented high expression in PCa cells according to the results of RT-qPCR. As shown by cell counting kit-8 assays, colony formation assays, wound-healing assays, Transwell assays and flow cytometry analyses, silenced FOXD1-AS1 suppressed PCa cell viability, proliferation, migration and invasion and enhanced cell apoptosis. Additionally, FOXD1-AS1 was primarily localised in cytoplasm of PCa cells. RNA immunoprecipitation assays and luciferase reporter assays revealed that FOXD1-AS1 interacted with miR-3167 in PCa cells. MiR-3167 functioned as an anti-oncogene in PCa and miR-3167 overexpression suppressed cell proliferation while promoted cell apoptosis. Moreover, the downstream target of miR-3167 is mRNA YWHAZ. FOXD1-AS1 elevated the expression of YWHAZ by binding with miR-3167. The suppressive effect of miR-3167 on YWHAZ expression was reversed by FOXD1-AS1 overexpression.

Patients and methods:   This multicentre observational prospective clinical study will include 100 patients with mCRPC from five Canadian academic centres. Patients with radiological or biochemical progression and harbouring at least three metastases by conventional imaging will be accrued. Intra-patient inter-metastatic heterogeneity will be determined with triple-tracer imaging using fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18 F-FDG), gallium-68-(68 Ga)-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-617 and 68 Ga-DOTATATE, which are a glucose analogue, a PSMA receptor ligand and a somatostatin receptor ligand, respectively. The 68 Ga-PSMA-617 and 18 F-FDG PET/CT scans will be performed first. If at least one PSMA-negative/FDG-positive lesion is observed, an additional PET/CT scan with 68 Ga-DOTATATE will be performed. The tracer uptake of individual lesions will be assessed for each PET tracer and patients with lesions presenting discordant uptake profiles will be considered as having inter-metastatic heterogeneous disease and may be offered a biopsy.  Expected results:   The proposed triple-tracer approach will allow whole-body mCRPC characterisation, investigating the inter-metastatic heterogeneity in order to better understand the phenotypic plasticity of prostate cancer, including the neuroendocrine transdifferentiation that occurs during mCRPC progression. Based on 68 Ga-PSMA-617 or 68 Ga-DOTATATE PET positivity, the potential eligibility of patients for PSMA and DOTATATE-based RLT will be assessed. Non-invasive whole-body determination of mCRPC heterogeneity and transdifferentiation is highly innovative and might establish the basis for new therapeutic strategies. Comparison of molecular imaging findings with biopsies will also link metastasis biology to radiomic features.

Due to high infective complications reported, some have suggested it is now time to abandon this technique in preference of a trans-perineal approach. The aim of this study was to report on the infection rates following transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate needle biopsy in multiple Australian centres.  Materials and methods:   Data were collected from seven Australian centres across four states and territories that undertake transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate needle biopsies for the diagnosis of prostate cancer, including major metropolitan and regional centres. In four centres, the data were collected prospectively. Rates of readmissions due to infection, urosepsis resulting in intensive care admission and mortality were recorded.  Results:   12,240 prostate biopsies were performed in seven Australian centres between July 1998 and December 2020. There were 105 readmissions for infective complications with rates between centres ranging from 0.19 to 2.60% and an overall rate of 0.86%. Admission to intensive care with sepsis ranged from 0 to 0.23% and overall 0.03%. There was no mortality in the 12,240 cases.  Conclusion:   Infective complications following transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate needle biopsies are very low, occurring in less than 1% of 12,240 biopsies.

Methods:   We merged US phase 2-3 prostate cancer clinical trial data from ClinicalTrials.gov with prostate cancer incidence data from statecancerprofiles.cancer.gov. We matched trial information from 293 closed and 560 active trials with incidence data for 2947 counties. Using multivariable logistic regression, we identified associations with trial termination. We identified 'scientifically-underserved' counties with the highest cancer incidence quintile (>61 annual cases) but lowest active trials quintile (0 or 1 trial).  Results:   Of 293 closed trials, one in three was terminated (n = 96, 32.8%). On multivariable analysis, only lower regional prostate cancer incidence was associated with higher likelihood of premature trial termination (OR 0.98, 95% CI [0.96-0.99] for every 100 cases, p = 0.03). We identified 188 counties with >61 annual prostate cancer cases but 0 or 1 active trials, indicating potential scientifically-underserved areas.

Autotaxin (ATX) is a lysophospholipase D-type exoenzyme that produces extracellular LPA. In contrast, glycerophosphodiesterase (GDE) family members GDE4 and GDE7 are intracellular lysophospholipases D that form LPA, depending on Mg2+ and Ca2+, respectively. Since no fluorescent substrate for these GDEs has been reported, in the present study, we examined whether a fluorescent ATX substrate, FS-3, could be applied to study GDE activity. We found that the membrane fractions of human GDE4- and GDE7-overexpressing human embryonic kidney 293T cells hydrolyzed FS-3 in a manner almost exclusively dependent on Mg2+ and Ca2+, respectively. Using these assay systems, we found that several ATX inhibitors, including α-bromomethylene phosphonate analog of LPA and 3-carbacyclic phosphatidic acid, also potently inhibited GDE4 and GDE7 activities. In contrast, the ATX inhibitor S32826 hardly inhibited these activities. Furthermore, FS-3 was hydrolyzed in a Mg2+-dependent manner by the membrane fraction of human prostate cancer LNCaP cells that express GDE4 endogenously but not by those of GDE4-deficient LNCaP cells.

The use of organosilicon-[18F]fluoride acceptors (SiFA) conjugated to urea-based peptidomimetic PSMA inhibitors provides a ""kit-like"" multidose synthesis technology. Nine novel 18F-labeled SiFA-bearing PSMA inhibitors with different linker moieties were synthesized and analyzed for their in vitro binding against [125I]I-TAAG-PSMA in LNCaP cells. IC50 values ranged from 58-570 nM. Among all compounds, [18F]SiFA-Asp2-PEG3-PSMA (IC50 = 125 nM) showed the highest tumor uptake in LNCaP tumors (SUV60min 0.73). A substantial increase in molar activity (Am) (from 7.5 ± 0.5 to 86 ± 3 GBq/μmol) led to a significant increase in LNCaP tumor uptake (SUV60min 1.18; Δ 0.45 corresponding to +62%). In vivo blocking with DCFPyL resulted in -32% uptake after 60 min.

Docetaxel (DTX) is the standard first-line chemotherapy for patients with metastatic CRPC; however, drug resistance is inevitable and often develops rapidly, leading to disease progression in nearly all patients. In contrast, when DTX is deployed with androgen deprivation therapy in castration-sensitive disease, more durable responses and improved outcomes are observed, suggesting that aberrant androgen receptor (AR) signaling accelerates DTX resistance in CRPC. In this study, we demonstrate that AR dysregulates the mitotic checkpoint, a critical pathway involved in the anticancer action of DTX.  Methods:   Androgen-dependent and independent cell lines were used to evaluate the role of AR in DTX resistance. Impact of drug treatment on cell viability, survival, and cell-cycle distribution were determined by plate-based viability assay, clonogenic assay, and cell-cycle analysis by flow cytometry, respectively. Mitotic checkpoint kinase signal transduction and apoptosis activation was evaluated by Western blotting. Pathway gene expression analysis was evaluated by RT-PCR. A Bliss independence model was used to calculate synergy scores for drug combination studies.  Results:   Activation of AR in hormone-sensitive cells induces a rescue phenotype by increasing cell viability and survival and attenuating G2/M arrest in response to DTX. Analysis of mitotic checkpoint signaling shows that AR negatively regulates spindle checkpoint signaling, resulting in premature mitotic progression and evasion of apoptosis. This phenotype is characteristic of mitotic slippage and is also observed in CRPC cell lines where we demonstrate involvement of AR splice variant AR-v7 in dysregulation of checkpoint signaling. Our findings suggest that DTX resistance is mediated through mechanisms that drive premature mitotic exit. Using pharmacologic inhibitors of anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome and polo-like kinase 1, we show that blocking mitotic exit induces mitotic arrest, apoptosis, and synergistically inhibits cell survival in combination with DTX.  Conclusion:   Our results suggest that targeting the mechanisms of dysregulated mitotic checkpoint signaling in AR-reactivated tumors has significant clinical potential to extend treatment benefit with DTX and improve outcomes in patients with lethal prostate cancer.""","""['Amanda Pilling', 'Sahn-Ho Kim', 'Clara Hwang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor splicing variant 7 (ARV7) inhibits docetaxel sensitivity by inactivating the spindle assembly checkpoint.', 'Resistance to docetaxel in prostate cancer is associated with androgen receptor activation and loss of KDM5D expression.', 'Combination treatment with docetaxel and histone deacetylase inhibitors downregulates androgen receptor signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Targeting persistent androgen receptor signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Development of a dual targeting scaffold of SET7/MLL inhibitor for castration-resistant prostate cancer treatment.', 'Systematic pan-cancer analysis on the expression and role of regulator of chromatin condensation 1/small nucleolar RNA host gene 3/small nucleolar RNA host gene 12.']"""

Yet, even with MRI-guided biopsy 15%-35% of high-risk lesions (Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System [PI-RADS] 4 and 5) are histologically benign. It is unclear if these false positives are due to diagnostic/sampling errors or pathophysiological alterations. To better understand this, we tested histologically benign PI-RAD 4 and 5 lesions for common malignant epigenetic alterations.  Materials and methods:   MRI-guided in-bore biopsy samples were collected from 45 patients with PI-RADS 4 (n = 31) or 5 (n = 14) lesions. Patients had a median clinical follow-up of 3.8 years. High-risk mpMRI patients were grouped based on their histology into biopsy positive for tumor (BPT; n = 28) or biopsy negative for tumor (BNT; n = 17). From these biopsy samples, DNA methylation of well-known tumor suppressor genes (APC, GSTP1, and RARβ2) was quantified.  Results:   Similar to previous work we observed high rates of promoter methylation at GSTP1 (92.7%), RARβ2 (57.3%), and APC (37.8%) in malignant BPT samples but no methylation in benign TURP chips. Interestingly, similar to the malignant samples the BNT biopsies also had increased methylation at the promoter of GSTP1 (78.8%) and RARβ2 (34.6%). However, despite these epigenetic alterations none of these BNT patients developed prostate cancer, and those who underwent repeat mpMRI (n = 8) demonstrated either radiological regression or stability.

This work reports a one-pot, 2-min synthesis strategy for ultrathin CuS nanocrystals (NCs) with precisely tunable size and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), where a single-starch-layer coating leads to a high LSPR absorption at the near-IR wavelength 980 nm. The CuS NC diameter increases from 4.7 (1 nm height along [101]) to 28.6 nm (4.9 nm height along [001]) accompanied by LSPR redshift from 978 to 1200 nm, as the precursor ratio decreases from 1 to 0.125. Photothermal temperature increases by 38.6 °C in 50 mg L-1 CuS NC solution under laser illumination (980 nm, 1.44 W cm-2 ). Notably, 98.4% of human prostate cancer PC-3/Luc+ cells are killed by as little as 5 mg L-1 starch-coated CuS NCs with 3-min laser treatment, whereas CuS NCs without starch cause insignificant cell death. LSPR modeling discloses that the starch layer enhances the photothermal effect by significantly increasing the free carrier density and blue-shifting the LSPR toward 980 nm.

Materials and methods:   In this retrospective and single-center study, 333 biopsy-naïve patients with TZ lesions who underwent biparametric magnetic resonance imaging (bp-MRI) were analyzed from January 2016 to March 2020. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine independent predictors of clinically significant prostate cancer (cs-PCa). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to compare diagnostic performance.  Results:   PI-RADS v2.1 and PSAD were the independent predictors for TZ cs-PCa in patients with PSA 4-20 ng/mL. 0.9% (2/213), 10.0% (7/70), and 48.0% (24/50) of PI-RADS v2.1 score 1-2, 3, and 4-5 had TZ cs-PCa. However, for patients with PI-RADS v2.1 score 1-2, there were no obvious changes in the detection of TZ cs-PCa (0.8% (1/129), 1.3% (1/75), and 0.0% (0/9)) combining with different PSAD stratification (PSAD < 0.15, 0.15-0.29, and ≥0.30 ng/mL/mL). For patients with PI-RADS v2.1 score ≥ 3, the TZ cs-PCa detection rate significantly varied according to different PSAD stratification. A PI-RADS v2.1 score 3 and PSAD < 0.15 and 0.15-0.29 ng/mL/mL had 8.6% (3/35) and 3.7% (1/27) of TZ cs-PCa, while a PI-RADS v2.1 score 3 and PSAD ≥ 0.30 ng/mL/mL had a higher TZ cs-PCa detection rate (37.5% (3/8)). A PI-RADS v2.1 score 4-5 and PSAD <0.15 ng/mL/mL had no cs-PCa (0.0% (0/9)). In contrast, a PI-RADS v2.1 score 4-5 and PSAD 0.15-0.29 and ≥0.30 ng/mL/mL had the highest cs-PCa detection rate (50.0% (10/20), 66.7% (14/21)). It showed the highest AUC in the combination of PI-RADS v2.1 and PSAD (0.910), which was significantly higher than PI-RADS v2.1 (0.889, P = 0.039) or PSAD (0.803, P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   For TZ patients with PSA 4-20 ng/mL, PI-RADS v2.1 score ≤ 2 can avoid an unnecessary biopsy regardless of PSAD. PI-RADS v2.1 score ≥ 3 may avoid an unnecessary biopsy after combining with PSAD.

However, the biological function of RANBP10 in glioblastoma (GBM) has not been studied. Here, we found that RANBP10 was overexpressed in GBM, and high RANBP10 expression was closely linked to poor survival of patients with GBM. Downregulation of RANBP10 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumor growth of GBM cells. In addition, we revealed that RANBP10 could suppress the promoter activity of FBXW7, and thereby increase the protein stability of c-Myc in GBM cells. Silencing of FBXW7 in RANBP10-knockdown GBM cells could partly negate the effects induced by RANBP10 downregulation.

Methods and materials:   The first 18 patients treated at the Hospital Quirónsalud Barcelona with the developed oART method were included. An ultrahypofractionated radiation therapy scheme consisting of 7 × 6.1 Gy was used. Patients were treated on 2 conventional Varian C-arm linacs. For each patient, a reference plan based on a planning computed tomography (pCT) scan was generated using the Eclipse system. On each treatment session, the pCT scan was rigidly registered with the daily cone beam computed tomography (CT) scan. The pCT-based target (prostate) and organs at risk were mapped onto the cone beam CT images and manually adapted to take into account the anatomy of the day. The reference plan was then copied to the cone beam CT scan, and a full reoptimization was done for the current anatomy (adapted plan). For each treatment session, the unaltered reference plan was recomputed on the daily cone beam CT scan by mimicking the soft-tissue alignment performed per our standard procedure (nonadapted plan). Over the 126 adapted sessions from the 18 patients, a dosimetric comparison of adapted against nonadapted plans was done.  Results:   A significant difference in the target coverage was found between the adapted and nonadapted plans (97.1 vs 90.4; P < .001) in favor of adapting. Without online adaptation, the optimal coverage of the prostate was not attained in 35% of fractions. Adapting allows for the improvement of the target coverage with compliance of all organ-at-risk dose constraints in all treatment fractions.  Conclusions:   The oART technique described in this study is technically feasible with a C-arm linac. To our knowledge, this is the first clinical experience with oART for prostate cancer including full replanning and delivered with a C-arm linac without artificial intelligence capability.""","""['Juan-Francisco Calvo-Ortega', 'Sandra Moragues-Femenía', 'Coral Laosa-Bello', 'José Torices-Caballero', 'Marcelino Hermida-López', 'Joan Casals-Farran']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Online adaptive radiotherapy of urinary bladder cancer with full re-optimization to the anatomy of the day: Initial experience and dosimetric benefits.', 'Evaluation of online/offline image guidance/adaptation approaches for prostate cancer radiation therapy.', 'Real-time adaptive planning method for radiotherapy treatment delivery for prostate cancer patients, based on a library of plans accounting for possible anatomy configuration changes.', 'Online adaptive planning methods for intensity-modulated radiotherapy.', 'Primary treatment of prostate cancer using 1.5\xa0T MR-linear accelerator.']"""

The CYP17A1-inhibitory activity was investigated in rat testicular microsomes using high-performance liquid chromatography. Testosterone levels were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunoassay. IC50 values were calculated for PC3, DU-145, LNCaP, and 22Rv1 cells using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) test. The antitumor effect in vivo was studied in DU-145 and 22Rv1 subcutaneous xenografts in Balb/c nude mice. Alsevirone reduced the CYP17A1-inhibitory activity by 98% ± 0.2%. A statistically significant reduction in the testosterone concentration in murine blood was recorded after the 7th administration of 300 mg/kg alsevirone at 0.31 ± 0.03 ng/ml (p < .001) versus 0.98 ± 0.22 ng/ml (p = .392) after abiraterone administration and 1.52 ± 0.49 ng/ml in control animals. Alsevirone was more cytotoxic than abiraterone in DU-145, LNCaP, and 22Rv1 cells, with IC50 values of 23.80 ± 1.18 versus 151.43 ± 23.70 μM, 22.87 ± 0.54 versus 28.80 ± 1.61 μM, and 35.86 ± 5.63 versus 109.87 ± 35.15 μM, respectively. Alsevirone and abiraterone significantly increased annexin V-positive, caspase 3/7-positive, and activated Bcl-2-positive cells. In 22Rv1 xenografts, alsevirone 300 mg/kg × 10/24 h per os inhibited tumor growth: on Day 9 of treatment, tumor growth inhibition = 59% (p = .022).

We showed previously that SAL induces cellular senescence in androgen-sensitive PCa cells and in ex vivo-treated patient PCa tumor samples. Here, we analyzed the underlying molecular pathway and reveal that SAL induces cellular senescence in both, castration-sensitive (CSPC) LNCaP and castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) C4-2 cells through the cell cycle inhibitor p15INK4b and increased phosphorylation of AKT. Treatment with the AKT inhibitor (AKTi) potently inhibited SAL-induced expression of p15INK4b and cellular senescence in both cell lines. Proximity-ligation assays (PLA) combined with high-resolution laser-scanning microscopy indicate that SAL promotes interaction of endogenous androgen receptor (AR) with AKT in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus detectable after three days. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) comparing the SAL-induced transcriptomes of LNCaP with C4-2 cells as well as with AKTi-treated cell transcriptomes revealed landscapes for cell senescence. Interestingly, one of the identified genes is the lncRNASAT1. SAL treatment of native patient tumor samples ex vivo upregulates lncRNASAT1. In PCa tumor tissues, lncRNASAT1 is downregulated compared with nontumor tissues of the same patients. Knockdown indicates that the lncRNASAT1 is crucial for SAL-induced cancer-cell senescence as an upstream factor for pAKT and for p15INK4b. Further, knockdown of lncRNASAT1 enhances cell proliferation by SAL, suggesting that lncRNASAT1 serves as a tumor suppressor at SAL. Interestingly, immunoprecipitation of AR detected lncRNASAT1 as an AR-interacting partner that regulates AR target-gene expression. Similarly, RNA-ChIP experiments revealed the interaction of AR with lncRNASAT1 on chromatin. Thus, we identified a novel AR-lncRNASAT1-AKT-p15INK4b signaling axis to mediate SAL-induced cellular senescence.""","""['Kimia Mirzakhani', 'Julia Kallenbach', 'Seyed Mohammad Mahdi Rasa', 'Federico Ribaudo', 'Martin Ungelenk', 'Marzieh Ehsani', 'Wenrong Gong', 'Nikolaus Gassler', 'Mirjam Leeder', 'Marc-Oliver Grimm', 'Francesco Neri', 'Aria Baniahmad']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Correction to: The androgen receptor-lncRNASAT1-AKT-p15 axis mediates androgen-induced cellular senescence in prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen-Induced MIG6 Regulates Phosphorylation of Retinoblastoma Protein and AKT to Counteract Non-Genomic AR Signaling in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Senolytic compounds control a distinct fate of androgen receptor agonist- and antagonist-induced cellular senescent LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Mechanisms of Androgen Receptor Agonist- and Antagonist-Mediated Cellular Senescence in Prostate Cancer.', 'A natural androgen receptor antagonist induces cellular senescence in prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Exploring the Communication of the SASP: Dynamic, Interactive, and Adaptive Effects on the Microenvironment.', 'Visualization of the protein-protein interactions of hormone receptors in hormone-dependent cancer research.', 'Senescence-induced immune remodeling facilitates metastatic adrenal cancer in a sex-dimorphic manner.', 'Identification of a novel senescence-associated signature to predict biochemical recurrence and immune microenvironment for prostate cancer.', 'p15INK4B is an alternative marker of senescent tumor cells in colorectal cancer.']"""

It is incompletely understood how and why tumor genomes differ by self-reported race and genetic ancestry.  Experimental design:   Among 2,069 men with prostate cancer (1,841 self-reported White, 63 Asian, 165 Black) with access to clinical-grade sequencing at the same cancer center, prevalence of tumor and germline alterations was assessed in cancer driver genes reported to have different alteration prevalence by race.  Results:   Clinical characteristics such as prostate-specific antigen and age at diagnosis as well as cancer stage at sample procurement differed by self-reported race. However, most genomic differences persisted when adjusting for clinical characteristics. Tumors from Black men harbored fewer PTEN mutations and more AR alterations than those from White men. Tumors from Asian men had more FOXA1 mutations and more ZFHX3 alterations than White men. Despite fewer TP53 mutations, tumors from Black men had more aneuploidy, particularly chromosome arm 8q gains, an adverse prognostic factor. Genetic ancestry was associated with similar tumor alterations as self-reported race, but also with modifiable cancer risk factors. Community-level average income was associated with chr8q gains after adjusting for race and ancestry.  Conclusions:   Tumor genomics differed by race even after accounting for clinical characteristics. Equalizing access to care may not fully eliminate such differences. Therapies for alterations more common in racial minorities are needed. Tumor genomic differences should not be assumed to be entirely due to germline genetics.""","""['Konrad H Stopsack', 'Subhiksha Nandakumar', 'Kanika Arora', 'Bastien Nguyen', 'Samantha E Vasselman', 'Barbara Nweji', 'Sean M McBride', 'Michael J Morris', 'Dana E Rathkopf', 'Susan F Slovin', 'Daniel C Danila', 'Karen A Autio', 'Howard I Scher', 'Lorelei A Mucci', 'David B Solit', 'Mithat Gönen', 'Yu Chen', 'Michael F Berger', 'Nikolaus Schultz', 'Wassim Abida#', 'Philip W Kantoff#']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Selected Articles from This Issue.', 'Genomic Profiling of Prostate Cancers from Men with African and European Ancestry.', 'Integrative comparison of the genomic and transcriptomic landscape between prostate cancer patients of predominantly African or European genetic ancestry.', 'Prostate-specific antigen values at the time of prostate cancer diagnosis in African-American men.', 'Prostate Cancer Genomics: Recent Advances and the Prevailing Underrepresentation from Racial and Ethnic Minorities.', ""'Race' and prostate cancer mortality in equal-access healthcare systems."", 'Comparative and integrative analysis of transcriptomic and epigenomic-wide DNA methylation changes in African American prostate cancer.', 'Actionable Genomic Alterations in Prostate Cancer Among Black and White United States Veterans.', 'Under-Representation of Racial Groups in Genomics Studies of Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasms.', 'Bridging Health Disparities: a Genomics and Transcriptomics Analysis by Race in Prostate Cancer.', 'Preclinical models of prostate cancer - modelling androgen dependency and castration resistance in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo.']"""

Design:   Nationwide population based cohort study.  Setting:   All hospitals in Denmark.  Participants:   75 983 patients aged 50 years or older with a first hospital admission for acute urinary retention during 1995-2017.  Main outcome measures:   Absolute risk of urogenital, colorectal, and neurological cancer and excess risk of these cancers among patients with acute urinary retention compared with the general population.  Results:   The absolute risk of prostate cancer after a first diagnosis of acute urinary retention was 5.1% (n=3198) at three months, 6.7% (n=4233) at one year, and 8.5% (n=5217) at five years. Within three months of follow-up, 218 excess cases of prostate cancer per 1000 person years were detected. An additional 21 excess cases per 1000 person years were detected during three to less than 12 months of follow-up, but beyond 12 months the excess risk was negligible. Within three months of follow-up the excess risk for urinary tract cancer was 56 per 1000 person years, for genital cancer in women was 24 per 1000 person years, for colorectal cancer was 12 per 1000 person years, and for neurological cancer was 2 per 1000 person years. For most of the studied cancers, the excess risk was confined to within three months of follow-up, but the risk of prostate and urinary tract cancer remained increased during three to less than 12 months of follow-up. In women, an excess risk of invasive bladder cancer persisted for several years.

Although studies have described natural language processing (NLP) of surgical pathology reports to automate information extraction, efforts have focused on specific cancer subtypes rather than across multiple oncologic domains. To address this gap, we developed and evaluated an NLP method to extract tumor staging and diagnosis information across multiple cancer subtypes.  Methods:   The NLP pipeline was implemented on an open-source framework called Leo. We used a total of 555,681 surgical pathology reports of 329,076 patients to develop the pipeline and evaluated our approach on subsets of reports from patients with breast, prostate, colorectal, and randomly selected cancer subtypes.  Results:   Averaged across all four cancer subtypes, the NLP pipeline achieved an accuracy of 1.00 for International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes, 0.89 for T staging, 0.90 for N staging, and 0.97 for M staging. It achieved an F1 score of 1.00 for International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes, 0.88 for T staging, 0.90 for N staging, and 0.24 for M staging.  Conclusion:   The NLP pipeline was developed to extract tumor staging and diagnosis information across multiple cancer subtypes to support the research enterprise in our institution. Although it was not possible to demonstrate generalizability of our NLP pipeline to other institutions, other institutions may find value in adopting a similar NLP approach-and reusing code available at GitHub-to support the oncology research enterprise with elements extracted from surgical pathology reports.""","""['Sajjad Abedian', 'Evan T Sholle', 'Prakash M Adekkanattu', 'Marika M Cusick', 'Stephanie E Weiner', 'Jonathan E Shoag', 'Jim C Hu', 'Thomas R Campion Jr']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""JCO Clin Cancer Inform""","""['Automated medical chart review for breast cancer outcomes research: a novel natural language processing extraction system.', 'Automated classification of cancer morphology from Italian pathology reports using Natural Language Processing techniques: A rule-based approach.', 'Automated Extraction of Grade, Stage, and Quality Information From Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor Pathology Reports Using Natural Language Processing.', 'Discerning tumor status from unstructured MRI reports--completeness of information in existing reports and utility of automated natural language processing.', 'A frame semantic overview of NLP-based information extraction for cancer-related EHR notes.', 'Generalizable and Automated Classification of TNM Stage from Pathology Reports with External Validation.', 'Natural Language Processing for Breast Imaging: A Systematic Review.', 'Supporting Structured Data Capture for Patients With Cancer: An Initiative of the University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center Survivorship Program to Improve Capture of Malignant Diagnosis and Cancer Staging Data.']"""

Materials and methods:   A total of 40 PCa cases and 41 controls from the CAPLIFE study were analyzed to determine the salivary melatonin rhythm through 6 saliva samples. Amplitude (maximum melatonin peak) was categorized as low or high using the cutoff point median of the controls. Acrophase (time of maximum melatonin peak) was classified as early or late using the same criteria. In addition, the following data were collected: characteristics related to sleep habits, and clinical and sociodemographic information. Melatonin rhythms were represented for cases and controls and analyzed according to urinary symptoms, tumor aggressiveness and tumor extension. Variations in melatonin levels were estimated using generalized estimating equations on the ln-transformed values. To estimate the association between amplitude, acrophase and PCa, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% CI were calculated using logistic regression models.  Results:   The mean age was 67.0 years (SD 7.3) for cases and 67.5 (SD 5.5) for controls. Melatonin levels were always lower in PCa cases than in controls. On average, melatonin levels in cases were -64.0% (95% CI -73.4, -51.4) than controls. PCa cases had lower amplitude, 26.0 pg/ml (SD 27.8) vs 46.3 pg/ml (SD 28.2; p <0.001). A high amplitude was associated with a decreased risk of PCa, aOR=0.31 (95% CI 0.11, 0.86), while a late acrophase could be increased risk of PCa, aOR=2.36 (95% CI 0.88, 6.27).

We sought to improve risk stratification by creating and validating a novel pathological nodal staging system incorporating number of metastatic lymph nodes (+LNs).  Materials and methods:   A total of 118,450 men who underwent radical prostatectomy for nonmetastatic prostate cancer in the National Cancer Database comprised our development cohort. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis with restricted cubic splines was used to assess the nonlinear association between number of +LNs and overall mortality (OM). A novel staging system based on number of +LNs was derived by recursive partitioning analysis. The staging system was validated for prediction of OM and prostate-specific mortality in 105,568 men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Discrimination was assessed via Harrell's c-index.  Results:   In multivariable Cox analysis, OM risk increased with higher number of +LNs up to 4 (HR 1.30 per each LN+, 95% CI 1.23-1.38), with a nonstatistically significant increase in risk (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.99-1.11) beyond 4 +LN. In the development cohort, recursive partitioning analysis identified optimal cutoffs at 0 (N0: referent), 1 (N1: HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.25-1.58), 2 (N2: HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.40-1.99), 3-5 (N3a: HR 2.18, 95% CI 0.84-2.60) and ≥6 (N3b: HR 3.00, 95% CI 2.37-3.79) +LNs.

The study aim was to evaluate the ability of mpMRI and PSMA PET/CT individually and in combination, to predict tumor location and Gleason score ≥3+4 on robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) histology.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 1,123 men with a preoperative mpMRI and 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT prior to a RALP. Tumor locations were collected from both imaging modalities and compared to totally embedded prostate histology. Lowest apparent diffusion coefficient value on mpMRI and the highest maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) on 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT were collected on the index lesions to perform analysis on detection rates.  Results:   Median prostate specific antigen was 6. Median Gleason score on biopsy and RALP histology was 4+3. The index lesion and multifocal tumor detection were similar between mpMRI and 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT (p=0.10; p=0.11). When combining mpMRI and 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT, index Gleason score ≥3+4 cancer at RALP was identified in 92%. Only 10% of patients with Gleason score ≤3+4 on biopsy with an SUVmax <5 were upgraded to ≥4+3 on RALP histology, compared to 90% if the SUVmax was >11.

The RNA CG force field with the geometrical restraints for maintaining PCA3 secondary structures is used. For each secondary structure, 5000 PCA3 structures were predicted by using 5000 independent initial structures. These structures were then evaluated by a scoring function, considering the contributions from the radius of gyration, contact energy, and surface fraction of complementary nucleotides to ASO683 and ASO735 used in the related experiment. For each secondary structure, the PCA3 structures with the highest three scores were selected for aptamer design and further adsorption simulation. The ASOs complementary to PCA3 surface segments possessing relatively higher RMSF values are selected to be the potential PCA3 aptamers. After the adsorption simulation, the adsorption energies of ASO961, ASO3181, ASO3533, and ASO3595 are higher than or comparable to those of ASO683 and ASO735 used in the experiment. The NEB method was used to obtain MEPs for the adsorption process of all predicted ASOs onto PCA3. The adsorption barriers range between 29 ∼ 39 kcal/mol, while the desorption barriers range between 112 ∼ 352 kcal/mol, indicating these aptamer/PCA3 complexes are very stable. Using PCA3 surface segments with relatively higher RMSF values, longer ASOs can be also obtained and most longer ASOs possess lower binding energy, ranging between -486.1 and -618.2 kcal/mol.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Skeletal-related events (SRE) like pathologic fracture or spinal cord compression are commonly seen in metastatic prostate cancer. Denosumab, a monoclonal antibody, acts by inhibiting osteoclast-mediated bone resorption in bone metastasis from solid tumors and reduces bone turnover and destruction. However, there is an increased risk of life-threatening denosumab-induced hypocalcemia with an incidence of 0.1 to 12.8%.  Case report:   Our patient is a 69-year-old man with widespread skeletal metastatic disease from primary prostate cancer who presented to the hospital complaining of generalized fatigue and joint pain. Due to severe debilitating low back pain secondary to osteochondral lesions, the patient was started on Denosumab 120 mg. On presentation, serum calcium was found to be severely low at 5.9 mg/dl (serum calcium level prior to Denosumab was 9.1 mg/dl).  Management and outcome:   Denosumab was discontinued immediately, and the patient was started on IV calcium gluconate. Repeat serum calcium level continued to be low at 6.7 likely due to the long elimination half-life of Denosumab (25-30 days). He was transferred to a long-term acute care facility for long-term IV calcium replacement, where he succumbed to illness six weeks later.  Discussion:   Denosumab, an anti-resorptive treatment for skeletal metastasis from solid tumors, is shown to cause severe life-threatening hypocalcemia. The maximum serum drug level of Denosumab reaches 7-21 days after administration. Sustained hypocalcemia is rare and life-threatening. Clinicians should use this medication with caution due to its unpredictable side effect profile.""","""['Kanchi Patell', 'Kumar Ajay', 'Abdul Rahman Al Armashi', 'Ameed Bawwab', 'Keyvan Ravakhah']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Oncol Pharm Pract""","""['A RANKL Wrinkle: Denosumab-Induced Hypocalcemia.', 'Hypocalcaemia in patients with prostate cancer treated with a bisphosphonate or denosumab: prevention supports treatment completion.', 'High serum ALP level is associated with increased risk of denosumab-related hypocalcemia in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors.', 'Denosumab causing severe, refractory hypocalcaemia in a patient with chronic kidney disease.', 'Hypocalcaemia following denosumab in prostate cancer: A clinical review.', 'Refractory Shock Secondary to Denosumab-induced Severe Hypocalcaemia.']"""

Evidence for the relationship between chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 2 (CXCR2) C1208T polymorphism and susceptibility to cancer remains inconsistent.  Methods:   Odds ratios (ORs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and combined analysis were used to investigate the effect of CXCR2 variation on cancer risk. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were also used to evaluate the expression of CXCR2 in prostate cancer (PCA).  Results:   Across 11 case-control studies, 4,909 cases and 5,884 controls were involved in the current analysis. Individuals with a TT genotype were associated with increased risk of digestive cancer, compared to those with a TC+CC genotype (OR = 1.16, 95%CI = 1.02-1.31, P = 0.025). Individuals carrying the TT genotype had a 39% higher risk of urinary cancer than those carrying CC genotype (OR = 1.39, 95%CI = 1.04-1.87, P = 0.025). Individuals with a TT genotype showed a 56% augmented breast cancer risk, compared to those with a CC genotype (OR = 1.56, 95%CI = 1.03-2.35, P = 0.034). It was found that CXCR2 expression was downregulated in PCA. Compared with PCA subjects carrying the CC genotype, the expression of CXCR2 was decreased in patients with the TT genotype.  Conclusions:   The CXCR2 C1208T variation was associated with elevated risk of urinary, breast, and digestive cancer.

However, there are only a few reports on the ratio of the expression levels of AR-V7 to AR (AR-V7/AR) in prostate tissue. The present study evaluated AR-V7/AR expression in various types of human prostate tissues and CRPC cells. Pretreatment prostate tissue samples from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH; n=18), Gleason score 7 (n=17), and Gleason score 8-10 (n=26) were collected at the time of prostate biopsy, and tissue samples from CRPC patients (n=10) were collected at the time of transurethral resection of the prostate. Furthermore, androgen-independent LNCaP cells were established. The mRNA expression levels of AR and AR-V7, cell proliferation and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) production were evaluated by reverse transcription quantitative PCR, MTS assay and chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay, respectively. There was a significant difference in AR-V7/AR expression ratios between the CRPC group and the BPH and pre-treatment PCa groups (CRPC, 7%; BPH and pre-treatment PCa, 1%). Subsequently, we compared the AR and AR-V7 expression levels in CRPC samples with those in the pretreatment prostate tissues from the same patients. The results demonstrated that the AR-V7/AR ratio increased from 3 to 9% after CRPC onset. Furthermore, in vitro experiment demonstrated that AR-V7 expression in LNCaP cells was increased after transforming into CRPC cells. The AR-V7/AR ratio also increased from 0.05 to 0.3%. In addition, small interfering (si)-RNA-mediated knockdown of AR inhibited the proliferation of and PSA production from androgen-independent LNCaP cells; however, AR-V7 knockdown had no effect. Conversely, siRNA-mediated knockdown of both AR and AR-V7 inhibited the proliferation of VCAP cells. In summary, the findings from the present study demonstrated that AR-V7 expression and AR-V7/AR ratio were increased after the onset of CRPC, which had a limited role in CRPC cell proliferation.

Prostatic metaplasia, characterized by glandular proliferation along the basal layer of epithelium in breast ducts, and in one case, within lobules, was seen in 18/22 specimens; 4/22 showed pilar metaplasia, consisting of hair shafts located within breast ducts, associated with squamoid metaplasia resembling hair matriceal differentiation. By immunohistochemistry, prostatic metaplasia was positive for PSA in 16/20 cases and positive for NKX3.1 in 15/20 cases. Forty-three reduction mammoplasty control cases showed no pilar metaplasia and no definite prostatic metaplasia, with no PSA and NKX3.1 staining observed.

TiO2 nanoparticles will be useful for the treatment of cancer with PDT and SDT as the sensitizers in medicine. In this study, TiO2 nanoparticles were used for an in vitro comparison between the PDT, SDT, SPDT damages on prostate cancer cell lines. For this purpose, the cells were incubated in RPMI-1640 media with various concentrations of TiO2 and subjected to 0,5 W/cm2 ultrasound and/or 0,5 mJ/cm2 light irradiation. The prostate cancer cells were irradiated with light and exposed with the US and both for SPDT in the presence and/or absence of TiO2. Cell viability was measured using by MTT test after treatments.

Methods:   We retrospectively identified 63 Black men deemed eligible for active surveillance based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, who underwent OncotypeDx Genomic Prostate Score testing between April 2016 and July 2020. Nonparametric statistical testing was used to compare relevant features between patients reclassified to a higher NCCN risk after genomic testing and those who were not reclassified.  Results:   The median age was 66 years and median pre-biopsy PSA was 7.3. Initial risk classifications were: very low risk: 7 (11.1%), low risk: 24(38.1%), favorable intermediate risk: 31(49.2%), and unfavorable intermediate risk: 1 (1.6%). Overall, NCCN risk classifications after Genomic Prostate Score testing were significantly higher than initial classifications (P=.003, Wilcoxon signed-rank). Among patients with discordant risk designations, 28(28/40, 70%) were reclassified to a higher NCCN risk after genomic testing. A pre-biopsy prostate specific antigen of greater than 10 did not have significantly higher odds of HBR (OR:2.16 [95% CI: 0.64,7.59, P=.2). Of favorable intermediate risk patients, 20(64.5%) were reclassified to a higher NCCN risk. Ultimately, 18 patients underwent definitive treatment.

Results from a large, single-institution series""","""Objective:   We aimed at optimizing the follow-up for patients with a positive multiparametric magnetic resonance of the prostate (mpMRI) and a subsequent negative targeted biopsy (TBx) plus systematic biopsy (SBx).  Materials and methods:   A total of 308 men with a clinical suspicion of PCa and a positive mpMRI (PI-RADS ≥ 3) with concomitant negative systematic and targeted Bx performed at a single tertiary referral center. All patients were then followed with serial PSA measurements, digital rectal examination and eventual follow-up mpMRI and/or repeat Bx. The primary outcome was to evaluate the overall clinically significant PCa (csPCa)-free survival. The secondary outcome was to assess the role of a repeat mpMRI (Fu-mpMRI) and PSA density as predictors of csPCa diagnosis (defined as Gleason score ≥ 3 + 4) during follow-up. Kaplan Meier analysis and univariable Cox regression were used for survival and predictive analyses.  Results:   Median follow-up was 31 months (IQR: 23-43). During the study period 116 (37.7%) and 68 (22.1%) of men received a Fu-mpMRI and a Fu-Bx, respectively. Overall, 51 (16.6%) and 15 (4.9%) patients had a positive mpMRI and clinically significant (csPCa) diagnosis during follow-up, respectively. Among 68 men who received a Fu-Bx, the 2- and 3-years csPCa diagnosis-free survival in men with negative vs. positive Fu-mpMRI was 97% vs. 65% and 92% vs. 65%, respectively. At univariate Cox-regression analysis the presence of a positive Fu-mpMRI resulted to be significantly associated with the presence of csPCa at Fu-Bx (HR: 5.8, 95% CI: 1.3-26.6, P = 0.008). The 2- and 3-years csPCa diagnosis-free survival in men with PSAd <0.15 vs. ≥0.15 was 89% vs. 77%, and 86% vs. 66%, respectively (HR: 2.6, 95% CI: 0.75-8.87, P = 0.13). The combination of negative Fu-mpMRI and PSAd<0.15 furtherly reduced the probability of csPCa diagnosis at Fu-Bx at only 6% at 3years (HR: 9.9, 95% CI: 1.9-38.6, P < 0.001) in this subgroup of patients.  Conclusions:   After a negative TBx for a positive mpMRI, more than half of Fu-mpMRI were negative. A persistent positive mpMRI was associated with a significant risk of csPCa. The risk of csPCa diagnosis in men with negative mpMRI performed after negative TBx and low PSAd was negligible.""","""['Francesco Barletta', 'Armando Stabile', 'Elio Mazzone', 'Giorgio Brembilla', 'Gabriele Sorce', 'Francesco Pellegrino', 'Simone Scuderi', 'Donato Cannoletta', 'Giuseppe Ottone Cirulli', 'Vito Cucchiara', 'Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Francesco De Cobelli', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Alberto Briganti']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Prostate cancer detection rate in men undergoing transperineal template-guided saturation and targeted prostate biopsy.', ""Negative Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Prostate Cancer: What's Next?"", 'Association Between Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) Score for the Index Lesion and Multifocal, Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', 'Positive Predictive Value of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2 for the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'What Is the Negative Predictive Value of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Excluding Prostate Cancer at Biopsy?

Methods:   From 1/2012 to 12/2018, fTPb was performed on consecutive men with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer. Patients included in this study had no previous diagnosis of prostate cancer, PSA between 2.5 ng/ml and 20 ng/ml, and underwent at least 12 core biopsies. In addition, those men who underwent pre-biopsy multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate were considered separately from those without prebiopsy imaging. Biopsies were performed by a single urologist who developed the needle guidance device used in the procedure. Clinical and pathological data were collected retrospectively. We compared observed biopsy outcomes with those predicted by PBCG nomogram utilizing chi-square statistical analysis.  Results:   Systematic fTPb (without pre-biopsy MRI) was performed in 301 men (median age 67, mean PSA 6.9 ng/mL). These men had a median of 20 biopsy cores. Clinically significant cancer (ISUP 2 or greater) was found in 33.9% of men. In men without pre-biopsy MRI, using PBCG Nomogram, we found no significant difference between the expected and observed number of clinically significant cancer (96 vs. 102; P = 0.09). An additional 73 men (median age 67, mean PSA 7.8 ng/ml) underwent pre-biopsy MRI imaging. The addition of MRI targets to systematic sampling resulted in a median of 25 cores. Clinically significant cancer was found in 49.3%. Using the PBCG Nomogram, in the men with pre-biopsy MRI we found clinically significant cancer in significantly more men than was expected by PBCG nomogram predictions (36 vs. 20; P = <0.01). There were no biopsy-related infectious complications.  Conclusion:   The fTPb technique is a promising method to sample the prostate which provides cancer detection that is comparable to that expected from systematic TRUS biopsy.

Prostate cancer cells (PC-3 and DU145) were exposed to a non-toxic level (0.5 or 2 μM) of Cd for up to 3 months, which resulted in significantly promoted migration and invasion of the cells. These phenotypic changes were considered to be the consequence of enhanced EMT as evidenced by diminished expression of E-cadherin and increased vimentin expression. Regarding the mechanisms of Cd-induced EMT, we found Smad3 was activated but without upregulation of TGF-β. Alternatively, we found endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress of prostate cancer cells was significantly evoked, which was parallel with the increased reactive oxygen species (ROS). Removal of ROS by N-acetylcysteine significantly reduced ER stress in prostate cancer cells, followed by the decrease of Smad3 phosphorylation and expression of nuclear Snail, resulting in the inhibition of EMT and malignant phenotypic changes of prostate cancer cells. These findings indicated a new TGF-β independent, ROS-mediated ER stress/Smad signaling pathway in chronic Cd exposure-induced EMT of prostate cancer cells, which could be a novel mechanism involved in cadmium-mediated cancer cells malignant transformation.

Methods:   Retrospective single center analysis of 961 vs. 121 BxPCa vs. IPCa patients (2008-2020). Kaplan-Meier plots and multivariable Cox regression models tested four different outcomes: (1) any-cause discontinuation; (2) discontinuation due to ISUP GG upgrading; (3) biopsy discontinuation due to ISUP GG upgrading or > 3 positive cores; (4) biopsy discontinuation or suspicious extraprostatic extension at surveillance mpMRI. Then, multivariable logistic regression models tested rates of clinically significant PCa (csPCa) (ISUP GG ≥ 3 or pT ≥ 3a or pN1) after radical prostatectomy (RP).  Results:   Median time follow-up was 35 (19-64) months. IPCa patients were at lower risk of any-cause (3-year survival: 79.3 vs. 66%; HR: 0.5, p = 0.001) and biopsy/MRI AS discontinuation (3-year survival: 82.3 vs. 72.7%; HR: 0.5, p = 0.001), compared to BxPCa patients.

In multivariable logistic regression models, IPCa patients were associated with higher rates of csPCa at RP (OR: 1.4, p = 0.03), relative to their BxPCa counterparts.  Conclusion:   AS represents a safe management strategy for IPCa. Compared to BxPCa, IPCa patients are less prone to experience any-cause and biopsy/MRI AS discontinuation.

Deregulation of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and several microRNAs (miRNAs) plays a relevant role in EMT, but their interplay has not been clarified yet. In this study, we provide evidence that DNMT3A interaction with several miRNAs has a central role in an ex vivo EMT PCa model obtained via exposure of PC3 cells to conditioned media from cancer-associated fibroblasts. The analysis of the alterations of the miRNA profile shows that miR-200 family (miR-200a/200b/429, miR-200c/141), miR-205 and miR-203, known to modulate key EMT factors, are down-regulated and hyper-methylated at their promoters. DNMT3A (mainly isoform a) is recruited onto these miRNA promoters, coupled with the increase of H3K27me3/H3K9me3 and/or the decrease of H3K4me3/H3K36me3. Most interestingly, our results reveal the differential expression of two DNMT3A isoforms (a and b) during ex vivo EMT and a regulatory feedback loop between miR-429 and DNMT3A that can promote and sustain the transition towards a more mesenchymal phenotype. We demonstrate the ability of miR-429 to target DNMT3A 3'UTR and modulate the expression of EMT factors, in particular ZEB1. Survey of the PRAD-TCGA dataset shows that patients expressing an EMT-like signature are indeed characterized by down-regulation of the same miRNAs with a diffused hyper-methylation at miR-200c/141 and miR-200a/200b/429 promoters.

Methods:   We conducted a retrospective analysis of 558 patients. Five different criteria for mpMRI progression were used: 1) a Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score increase; 2) a lesion size increase; 3) an extraprostatic extension score increase; 4) overall mpMRI progression; and 5) the number of criteria met for mpMRI progression (0 vs 1 vs 2-3). In addition, two definitions of PCa upgrading were evaluated: 1) International Society of Urological Pathology Grade Group (ISUP GG) ≥2 with >10% of pattern 4 and 2) ISUP GG ≥ 3. Estimated annual percent changes methodology was used to show the temporal trends of mpMRI progression criteria. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of mpMRI progression criteria were also analysed. Multivariable logistic regression models tested PCa upgrading rates.  Results:   Lower rates over time for all mpMRI progression criteria were observed. The NPV of serial mpMRI scans ranged from 90.5% to 93.5% (ISUP GG≥2 with >10% of pattern 4 PCa upgrading) and from 98% to 99% (ISUP GG≥3 PCa upgrading), depending on the criteria used for mpMRI progression. A prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD) threshold of 0.15 ng/mL/mL was used to substratify those patients who would be able to skip a prostate biopsy. In multivariable logistic regression models assessing PCa upgrading rates, all five mpMRI progression criteria achieved independent predictor status.  Conclusion:   During AS, approximately 27% of patients experience mpMRI progression at first repeat MRI. However, the rates of mpMRI progression decrease over time at subsequent mpMRI scans.

Despite potential treatability in early stages, PCa diagnosis is challenging because of late symptoms' onset and limits of current screening procedures. It has been now accepted that cell transformation leads to release of volatile organic compounds in biologic fluids, including urine. Thus, several studies proposed the possibility to develop new diagnostic tools based on urine analysis. Among these, electronic noses (eNoses) represent one of the most promising devices, because of their potential to provide a non-invasive diagnosis. Here we describe the approach aimed at defining the experimental protocol for eNose application for PCa diagnosis. Our research investigates effects of sample preparation and analysis on eNose responses and repeatability.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multisurgeon study with the largest cohort on very early (POD 2) catheter removal after RARP with follow-up of >1 yr. In 255/369 patients (69%) treated with RARP ± pelvic lymph node dissection, the catheter was removed on POD 2. Among the 255 patients, 33 (13%) required recatheterisation because of acute urinary retention after catheter removal. Of these 33 patients, five (2%) also experienced anastomotic leakage after catheter removal. The early (≤3 mo) urinary continence rate was 67% and the median time to urinary continence recovery was 1 mo. After median follow-up of 18 mo (interquartile range 13-24), 236 patients (88%) were continent. No anastomotic strictures occurred. Our observations confirm the feasibility and safety of POD 2 catheter removal after RARP and support its adoption for selected patients.

Material and methods:   Within the SEER database (2004-2016), we identified m-UraC patients aged ≥ 18 years. Propensity score matching (PSM: cystectomy status, age and sex), Kaplan-Meier plots, cumulative incidence plots, Cox regression models and competing risks regression (CRR) models addressed overall mortality (OM) and cancer-specific mortality (CSM).  Results:   Overall, 274 m-UraC patients were identified with a median age of 70 years. Most were male (66%) and Caucasian (72%). Overall, 32% received chemotherapy.

Objective:   To assess surgical and functional outcomes of this treatment of RUF.  Design, setting, and participants:   A retrospective study was conducted in two referral hospitals including 21 patients who underwent RUF transperineal repair with GMFI between 2008 and 2020.  Surgical procedure:   The standard vertical perineal approach is performed for fistula dissection. Bladder and rectal defects are closed separately. After dissection from its facia, the flap is harvested, preserving its pedicle; it is brought to the perineum and placed between the urethra and the rectum to fully cover the sutures.  Measurements:   Fistula closure (clinical data and postoperative cystography), digestive stoma closure, and complications graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification were reviewed. Functional results were assessed using the Urinary Symptom Profile (USP) questionnaire, anal incontinence St Mark's score, Patient Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) score, and a nonvalidated Likert scale questionnaire assessing issues with lower extremity functionality.  Results and limitations:   The median (interquartile range) follow-up was 27 (8-47) mo. Fistula closure was successful for 20 patients (95% success). Digestive stoma was closed in 10/12 shunted patients (83%). Two (9%) Clavien-Dindo grade ≥3b complications were reported (one urinoma in a kidney transplant patient and one thigh haematoma evacuation). Eighteen patients (86%) completed the postoperative questionnaire; 11/18 (61%) had significant urinary incontinence. The mean (standard deviation) USP dysuria score was 1/9 (1.2), mean St Mark's score was 5/24 (5), mean POSAS score was 19/70 (11), mean lower extremity functionality score was 2/20 (4), and mean procedure patient satisfaction score was 9/10 (2). The retrospective design and limited number of patients are the main limitations.  Conclusions:   The present study found an excellent success rate and low morbidity for RUF transperineal repair with GMFI. Functional outcomes were satisfactory despite a high urinary incontinence rate.  Patient summary:   We performed an analysis of the outcomes of perineal approach surgery with muscle interposition for closing abnormal communication between the bladder and the rectum after prostate cancer treatment.

Mechanistically, the ubiquitin ligase CRL1FBXO31 promotes the ubiquitylation-mediated degradation of DUSP6, a dual specificity phosphatase that dephosphorylates and inactivates the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase-1 and -2 (ERK1/2). Depletion of FBXO31 stabilizes DUSP6, suppresses ERK signaling, and activates the PI3K-AKT signaling cascade. Moreover, deletion of FBXO31 promotes tumor development in a mouse orthotopic model of prostate cancer. Treatment with BCI, a small molecule inhibitor of DUSP6, suppresses AKT activation and prevents tumor formation, suggesting that the FBXO31 tumor suppressor activity is dependent on DUSP6.

The transcription co-activator lens epithelium-derived growth factor p75 (LEDGF/p75), also known as DFS70 and PSIP1, is upregulated in several human cancers, including PCa and promotes resistance to docetaxel and other drugs. The C-terminal region of LEDGF/p75 contains an integrase binding domain (IBD) that tethers nuclear proteins, including the HIV-1 integrase and transcription factors, to active chromatin to promote viral integration and transcription of cellular survival genes. Here, we investigated the contribution of the LEDGF/p75 IBD interactome to PCa chemoresistance. Quantitative immunoblotting revealed that LEDGF/p75 and its IBD-interacting partners are endogenously upregulated in docetaxel-resistant PCa cell lines compared to docetaxel-sensitive parental cells. Using specific human autoantibodies, we co-immunoprecipitated LEDGF/p75 with its endogenous IBD-interacting partners JPO2, menin, MLL, IWS1, ASK1, and PogZ, as well as transcription factors c-MYC and HRP2, in docetaxel-resistant cells, and confirmed their nuclear co-localization by confocal microscopy. Depletion of LEDGF/p75 and selected interacting partners robustly decreased the survival, clonogenicity, and tumorsphere formation capacity of docetaxel-resistant cells.

HS-PEGn-COOH (PEG: polyethylene glycol, n = 3000, 5000, 10,000) was conjugated, in an organic medium by covalent linkages, on TiONts surface. This study aimed to investigate the influence of different PEG derivatives chain lengths on the TiONts colloidal stability, on the PEGn density and conformation, as well as on the DTX biological activity in a prostate cancer model (human PC-3 prostate adenocarcinoma cells). In vitro tests highlighted significant cytotoxicities of the drug after loading DTX on PEGn-modified TiONts (TiONts-PEGn-DTX). Higher grafting densities for shorter PEGylated chains were most favorable on DTX cytotoxicity by promoting both colloidal stability in biological media and cells internalization.

Therefore, STAT3 is a therapeutic target for cancer drug discovery. Acacetin, a flavone present in various plants, inhibits constitutive and inducible STAT3 activation in STAT3-activated DU145 prostate cancer cells. Acacetin inhibits STAT3 activity by directly binding to STAT3, which we confirmed by a pull-down assay with a biotinylated compound and two level-free methods, namely, a drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) experiment and a cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA). Acacetin inhibits STAT3 phosphorylation at the tyrosine 705 residue and nuclear translocation in DU145 cells, which leads to the downregulation of STAT3 target genes. Acacetin then induces apoptosis in a time-dependent manner. Interestingly, acacetin induces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are not involved in the acacetin-induced inhibition of STAT3 activation because the suppressed p-STAT3 level is not rescued by treatment with GSH or NAC, which are general ROS inhibitors. We also found that acacetin inhibits tumor growth in xenografted nude mice.

The tests confirmed the system's ability to attach about 20 5FU molecules per one dendrimer molecule for the G4PAMAM dendrimer and about 25 molecules for the G6PAMAM dendrimer, which gives a system yield of 16% for the fourth generation and 5% for sixth generation dendrimers.

In prostate and breast cancers, AR activation can be achieved also by a ligand-independent signaling through receptor tyrosine kinases such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Considering its major role in glioblastoma, we explored whether EGFR is involved in AR signaling in this tumor. Analysis of mRNA expression in 28 glioblastoma samples with quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed a positive and significant correlation between AR and EGFR mRNA expression levels (R = 0.47, p = 0.0092), which was validated by The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset (n = 671) analysis (R = 0.3, p = 0.00006). Using Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining, we showed that the transduced overexpression of EGFR or its variant EGFRvIII in the U87MG cells induced AR protein overexpression and nuclear translocation and Protein kinase B (AKT) S473 and AR S210/213 phosphorylation. The EGFR kinase inhibitor afatinib and the AKT inhibitor MK2206 reduced AR nuclear translocation. Afatinib diminished AKT phosphorylation at 30 min and 6 h in the EGFR- and EGFRvIII-overexpressing cells, respectively, and decreased AR phosphorylation in EGFR-overexpressing cells at 4 h. Afatinib or MK2206 combination therapy with the AR antagonist enzalutamide in the EGFR and EGFRvIII-overexpressing cells had synergistic efficacy.

However, evidence obtained in numerous in vitro studies indicates that proliferation arrest and/or killing of cancer cells require quite high micromolar concentrations of polyphenols that are difficult to reach in vivo and can also be (geno)toxic to at least some types of normal cells. The ability of certain polyphenols to synergize with one another at low concentrations can be used as a promising strategy to effectively treat human malignancies. We have recently reported that curcumin and carnosic acid applied at non-cytotoxic concentrations synergistically cooperate to induce massive apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia cells, but not in normal hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells, via sustained cytosolic calcium overload. Here, we show that the two polyphenols can also synergistically suppress the growth of DU145 and PC-3 metastatic prostate cancer cell cultures. However, instead of cell killing, the combined treatment induced a marked inhibition of cell proliferation associated with G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. This was preceded by transient elevation of cytosolic calcium levels and prolonged dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, without generating oxidative stress, and was associated with defective oxidative phosphorylation encompassing mitochondrial dysfunction. The above effects were concomitant with a significant downregulation of mRNA and protein expression of the oncogenic kinase SGK1, the mitochondria-hosted mTOR component. In addition, a moderate decrease in SGK1 phosphorylation at Ser422 was observed in polyphenol-treated cells. The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin produced a similar reduction in SGK1 mRNA and protein levels as well as phosphorylation. Collectively, our findings suggest that the combination of curcumin and carnosic acid at potentially bioavailable concentrations may effectively target different types of cancer cells by distinct modes of action.

However, there are no reports of its activity against ovarian cancer. Therefore, we investigated whether β-sitosterol shows anticancer effects against ovarian cancer using human ovarian cancer cell lines. We confirmed that β-sitosterol induced the apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells and suppressed their proliferation. It triggered pro-apoptosis signals and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, enhanced the generation of reactive oxygen species and calcium influx through the endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria axis, and altered signaling pathways in human ovarian cancer cells. In addition, we observed inhibition of cell aggregation, suppression of cell growth, and decreased cell migration in ovarian cancer cells treated with β-sitosterol. Further, our data obtained using ovarian cancer cells showed that, in combination with standard anti-cancer drugs, β-sitosterol demonstrated synergistic anti-cancer effects.

AKT activation is key in a number of cellular processes. While many positive regulators for either EMT or AKT activation have been reported, few negative regulators are established. Through kinase cDNA screen, we identified brain-type creatine kinase (CKB or BCK) as a potent suppressor for both. As a ubiquitously expressed kinase in normal tissues, CKB is significantly downregulated in several solid cancer types. Lower CKB expression is significantly associated with worse prognosis. Phenotypically, CKB overexpression suppresses, while its silencing promotes, EMT and cell migration, xenograft tumor growth and metastasis of prostate cancer cells. AKT activation is one of the most prominent signaling events upon CKB silencing in prostate cancer cells, which is in line with prostate cancer TCGA data. EMT enhanced by CKB silencing is abolished by AKT inhibition. Mechanistically, CKB interacts with AKT and sequestrates it from activation by mTOR. We further elucidated that an 84aa fragment at C-terminus of CKB protein interacts with AKT's PH domain. Ectopic expression of the 84aa CKB fragment inhibits AKT activation, EMT and cell proliferation. Interestingly, molecular dynamics simulation on crystal structures of AKT and CKB independently demonstrates that AKT's PH domain and CKB's 84aa fragment establish their major interaction interface. In summary, we have discovered CKB as a negative regulator of EMT and AKT activation, revealing a new mode of their regulation .

We aimed to develop a novel dosiomics-based prediction model for BCR in patients with prostate cancer and clarify the correlations between the dosimetric factors and BCR.  Methods and materials:   This study included 489 patients with localized prostate cancer (BCR: 96; no-BCR: 393) who received intensity modulated radiation therapy. A total of 2475 dosiomic features were extracted from the dose distributions on the prostate, clinical target volume (CTV), and planning target volume. A prediction model for BCR was trained on a training cohort of 342 patients. The performance of this model was validated using the concordance index (C-index) in a validation cohort of 147 patients. Another model was constructed using clinical variables, dosimetric parameters, and radiomic features for comparisons. Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank analysis were used to assess the univariate discrimination based on the predictive dosiomic features.  Results:   The dosiomic feature derived from the CTV was significantly associated with BCR (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.57-0.93; P = .01). Although the dosiomics model outperformed the dosimetric and radiomics models, it did not outperform the clinical model. The performance significantly improved by combining the clinical variables and dosiomic features (C-index: 0.67; 95% CI, 0.65-0.68; P < .0001). The predictive dosiomic features were used to distinguish high-risk and low-risk patients (P < .05).  Conclusions:   The dosiomic feature extracted from the CTV was significantly correlated with BCR in patients with prostate cancer, and the dosiomics model outperformed the model with conventional dose indices. Hence, new metrics for evaluating the quality of a treatment plan are warranted.

Paclitaxel (PTX) is a highly active chemotherapeutic drug and the first-line treatment for PCa; however, conventional PTX formulation causes severe hypersensitivity reactions and limits PTX use at high concentrations. In the pursuit of high molecular weight, biodegradable, and pH-responsive polymeric carriers, one conjugates PTX to a polyacetal-based nanocarrier to yield a tert-Ser-PTX polyacetal conjugate. tert-Ser-PTX conjugate provides sustained release of PTX over 2 weeks in a pH-responsive manner while also obtaining a degree of epimerization of PTX to 7-epi-PTX. Serum proteins stabilize tert-Ser-PTX, with enhanced stability in human serum versus PBS (pH 7.4). In vitro efficacy assessments in PCa cells demonstrate IC50 values above those for the free form of PTX due to the differential cell trafficking modes; however, in vivo tolerability assays demonstrate that tert-Ser-PTX significantly reduces the systemic toxicities associated with free PTX treatment. tert-Ser-PTX also effectively inhibits primary tumor growth and hematologic, lymphatic, and coelomic dissemination, as confirmed by in vivo and ex vivo bioluminescence imaging and histopathological evaluations in mice carrying orthotopic LNCaP tumors.

Here, we demonstrated that a replication stress response (RSR) defect gene expression signature, but not other proposed biomarkers, is associated with ICB response in 12 independent cohorts of patients with nonhypermutated cancer across seven tumor types, including those of the breast, prostate, kidney, and brain. Induction or suppression of RSR deficiencies was sufficient to modulate response to ICB in preclinical models of breast and renal cancers. Mechanistically, we found that despite robust activation of checkpoint kinase 1 signaling in RSR-deficient cancer cells, aberrant replication origin firing caused exhaustion of replication protein A, resulting in accumulation of immunostimulatory cytosolic DNA. We further found that deficient RSR coincided with increased intratumoral dendritic cells in both mouse cancer models and human tumors. Together, this work demonstrates that the RSR defect gene signature can accurately identify patients who may benefit from ICB across numerous nonhypermutated tumor types, and pharmacological induction of RSR defects may further expand the benefits of ICB to more patients.""","""['Daniel J McGrail', 'Patrick G Pilié', 'Hui Dai', 'Truong Nguyen Anh Lam', 'Yulong Liang', 'Leonie Voorwerk', 'Marleen Kok', 'Xiang H-F Zhang', 'Jeffrey M Rosen', 'Amy B Heimberger', 'Christine B Peterson', 'Eric Jonasch', 'Shiaw-Yih Lin']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Sci Transl Med""","""['Novel genomic signature predictive of response to immune checkpoint blockade: A pan-cancer analysis from project Genomics Evidence Neo-plasia Information Exchange (GENIE).', 'Clonal tracing reveals diverse patterns of response to immune checkpoint blockade.', 'High tumor mutation burden fails to predict immune checkpoint blockade response across all cancer types.', 'Biomarkers of Immune Checkpoint Blockade Response in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.', 'The developing landscape of combinatorial therapies of immune checkpoint blockade with DNA damage repair inhibitors for the treatment of breast and ovarian cancers.', 'Checkpoint kinase 1/2 inhibition potentiates anti-tumoral immune response and sensitizes gliomas to immune checkpoint blockade.', 'Immune checkpoint blockade in glioblastoma: from tumor heterogeneity to personalized treatment.', 'Exploiting DNA Replication Stress as a Therapeutic Strategy for Breast Cancer.', 'Leveraging the replication stress response to optimize cancer therapy.', 'Next Steps for Immunotherapy in Glioblastoma.']"""

Methods:   Twenty-three patients with localized prostate cancer treated with moderately hypofractionated prostate radiotherapy with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) between December 2016 and February 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Included patients were required to have an identifiable DIL on bi-parametric planning magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). After import into the RayStation treatment planning system and application of a step-wise density override, the fractional doses were computed on each CBCT and were consecutively mapped onto the planning CT via a deformation vector field derived from deformable image registration. Fractional doses were accumulated for all CBCTs and interpolated for missing CBCTs, resulting in the delivered dose for PTVDIL, PTVBoost, PTV, and the organs at risk. The location of the index lesions was recorded according to the sector map of the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PIRADS) Version 2.1. Target coverage of the index lesions was evaluated and stratified for location.  Results:   In total, 338 CBCTs were available for analysis. Dose accumulation target coverage of PTVDIL, PTVBoost, and PTV was excellent and no cases of underdosage in DMean, D95%, D02%, and D98% could be detected. Delivered rectum DMean did not significantly differ from the planned dose. Bladder mean DMean was higher than planned with 19.4 ± 7.4 Gy versus 18.8 ± 7.5 Gy, p < 0.001. The penile bulb showed a decreased delivered mean DMean with 29.1 ± 14.0 Gy versus 29.8 ± 14.4 Gy, p < 0.001. Dorsal DILs, defined as DILs in the posterior medial peripheral zone of the prostate, showed a significantly lower delivered dose with a mean DMean difference of 2.2 Gy (95% CI 1.3-3.1 Gy, p < 0.001) compared to ventral lesions.  Conclusions:   CBCT-based dose accumulation showed an adequate delivered dose to the dominant intraprostatic lesion and organs at risk within planning limits. Cautious evaluation of the target coverage for index lesions adjacent to the rectum is warranted to avoid underdosage.""","""['Jörg Tamihardja', 'Sinan Cirsi', 'Patrick Kessler', 'Gary Razinskas', 'Florian Exner', 'Anne Richter', 'Bülent Polat', 'Michael Flentje']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Dominant intraprostatic lesion boosting in sexual-sparing radiotherapy of prostate cancer: A planning feasibility study.', 'Accumulation of the delivered dose based on cone-beam CT and deformable image registration for non-small cell lung cancer treated with hypofractionated radiotherapy.', 'Associations between volume changes and spatial dose metrics for the urinary bladder during local versus pelvic irradiation for prostate cancer.', 'Parotid gland radiation dose-xerostomia relationships based on actual delivered dose for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.', 'MRI-GUIDED RADIOTHERAPY FOR PROSTATE CANCER: A NEW PARADIGM.', 'Advantages and robustness of partial VMAT with prone position for neoadjuvant rectal cancer evaluated by CBCT-based offline adaptive radiotherapy.', 'Evaluation of Hybrid VMAT Advantages and Robustness Considering Setup Errors Using Surface Guided Dose Accumulation for Internal Lymph Mammary Nodes Irradiation of Postmastectomy Radiotherapy.', 'Prognosis Analysis and Perioperative Research of Elderly Patients with Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer under Computed Tomography Image of Three-Dimensional Reconstruction Algorithm.']"""

However, the clinical development of current reported BRD4-PROTACs have stagnated, largely due to the safety risks caused by their poor degradation selectivity. In this study, we designed and synthesized a series of PROTACs based on our recently reported dual BET/PLK1 inhibitor WNY0824, which led to the discovery of an isoform-selective and potent BRD4-PROTAC 12a (WWL0245). WWL0245 exhibited excellent selective cytotoxicity in the BETi sensitive cancer cell lines, including AR-positive prostate cancer cell lines. It could also efficiently induce ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of BRD4 in AR-positive prostate cancer cell lines, with sub-nanomolar half-maximal degrading concentration (DC50) and maximum degradation (Dmax) > 99%. Moreover, WWL0245 induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase and apoptosis in AR-positive prostate cancer by downregulation of the protein levels of AR, PSA and c-Myc as well as transcriptionally suppressed AR-regulated genes.

This cell-isolation capsule with an engineered alginate hydrogel-wall allows small molecules, large molecules, and bacteria to diffuse out from the capsules freely but immobilizes the encapsulated cells inside and prevents cells in the microenvironment from moving in. The encapsulated cells show a high survival rate with isolation of host immune cells and long-term growth with adequate nutrients and oxygen supply. In addition, by sharing and responding to the normal molecular and vesicular microenvironment (NMV microenvironment), encapsulated cancer cells display a transition from tumorous phenotypes to ductal features of normal epithelial cells.

Herein, we explored in-depth the release of turn-on fluorogenic payloads from a homoserinyl-based phosphoramidate acid-cleavable linker. Kinetics of payload release from the scaffold was observed in buffers representing the pH conditions of systemic circulation, early and late endosomes, and lysosomes. It was found that payload release takes place in two key consecutive steps: (1) P-N bond hydrolysis and (2) spacer immolation. These two steps were found to follow pseudo-first-order kinetics and had opposite dependencies on pH. P-N bond hydrolysis increased with decreasing pH, while spacer immolation was most rapid at physiological pH. Despite the contrasting release kinetics of these two steps, maximal payload release was observed at the mildly acidic pH (5.0-5.5), while minimal payload release occurred at physiological pH. We integrated this phosphoramidate-payload linker system into a PSMA-targeted fluorescent turn-on probe to study the intracellular trafficking and release of a fluorescent payload in PSMA-expressing prostate cancer cells. Results showed excellent turn-on and accumulation of the coumarin payload in the late endosomal and lysosomal compartments of these cells.

Nevertheless, the precise mechanism remains unclear. The present study aimed to identify a novel miR‑149 regulatory network and potential therapeutic target for CRPC.

Furthermore, it was also revealed that miR‑149 could reduce the functional activity of the PI3K/Akt1 signaling pathway by targeting Akt1 protein, the key regulatory factor of the PI3K/Akt1 signaling pathway. Knockdown of Akt1 by short hairpin RNA increased apoptosis, reduced proliferation, and restrained migration and invasion in CRPC cells, with the effect of AR inhibition. In conclusion, these results revealed that miR‑149 acts as a tumor suppressor in CRPC cell line C4‑2 and restrains its progression through the AR signaling pathway by targeting Akt1.

Although the long non-coding RNA LINC00115 was identified as an oncogene in several cancers, the expression and function of LINC00115 in prostate cancer have not been explored. Our results showed that LINC00115 was significantly up-regulated in prostate cancer tissues, which was significantly associated with a poor prognosis for prostate cancer patients. Functional studies showed that knockdown LINC00115 inhibited cell proliferation and invasion. In addition, LINC00115 served as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) through sponging miR-212-5p to release Frizzled Family Receptor 5 (FZD5) expression. The expression of miR-212-5p was noticeably low in tumour tissues, and FZD5 expression level was down-regulated with the knockdown of LINC00115. Knockdown LINC00115 inhibited the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway by inhibiting the expression of FZD5. Rescue experiments further showed that LINC00115 inhibits prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasion via targeting miR-212-5p/ FZD5/ Wnt/β-catenin axis. The present study provided clues that LINC00115 may be a promising novel therapeutic target for prostate cancer patients.""","""['Naixiong Peng', 'Zejian Zhang', 'Yaomin Wang', 'Minlong Yang', 'Jiqing Fan', 'Qinjun Wang', 'Ling Deng', 'Dong Chen', 'Yuefeng Cai', 'Qihui Li', 'Xisheng Wang', 'Wei Li']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Cell Mol Med""","""['Long Noncoding RNA SOX2-OT Knockdown Inhibits Proliferation and Metastasis of Prostate Cancer Cells Through Modulating the miR-452-5p/HMGB3 Axis and Inactivating Wnt/β-Catenin Pathway.', 'LncRNA LINC00115 facilitates lung cancer progression through miR-607/ITGB1 pathway.', 'LncRNA BANCR Promotes Pancreatic Cancer Tumorigenesis via Modulating MiR-195-5p/Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathway.', 'Long non-coding RNA-NEAT1, a sponge for miR-98-5p, promotes expression of oncogene HMGA2 in prostate cancer.', 'miR-33b in human cancer: Mechanistic and clinical perspectives.', 'Importance of long non-coding RNAs in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of prostate cancer.', 'LAPTM5 regulated by FOXP3 promotes the malignant phenotypes of breast cancer through activating the Wnt/β‑catenin pathway.', 'Multi-hallmark long noncoding RNA maps reveal non-small cell lung cancer vulnerabilities.', 'The interplay between non-coding RNAs and Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway in urinary tract cancers: from tumorigenesis to metastasis.', 'Androgen-Responsive Oncogenic lncRNA RP11-1023L17.1 Enhances c-Myc Protein Stability in Prostate Cancer.']"""

This commentary examines changes in distress among people with cancer who participated in a tele-based psychosocial intervention, from the point of initial distress screening to 12 months after commencing the intervention. The goal is to contribute to the discussion about the potential infrastructure requirements of implementing screening programs among screening 'hesitant' cancer care services. Secondary analysis showed a general downward distress trajectory though the greatest reduction occurred between recruitment and baseline and before receiving a low-intensity psychosocial intervention (β = - 1.84, 95% CI - 2.12, - 1.56).

We have previously shown that PIM1 phosphorylates the androgen receptor (AR), the primary therapeutic target in prostate cancer, at serine 213 (pS213), which alters expression of select AR target genes. Therefore, we sought to investigate the mechanism whereby PIM1 phosphorylation of AR alters its transcriptional activity. We previously identified the AR co-activator, 14-3-3 ζ, as an endogenous PIM1 substrate in LNCaP cells. Here, we show that PIM1 phosphorylation of AR and 14-3-3 ζ coordinates their interaction, and that they extensively occupy the same sites on chromatin in an AR-dependent manner. Their occupancy at a number of genes involved in cell migration and invasion results in a PIM1-dependent increase in the expression of these genes. We also use rapid immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry of endogenous proteins on chromatin (RIME), to find that select AR co-regulators, such as hnRNPK and TRIM28, interact with both AR and 14-3-3 ζ in PIM1 over-expressing cells. We conclude that PIM1 phosphorylation of AR and 14-3-3 ζ coordinates their interaction, which in turn recruits additional co-regulatory proteins to alter AR transcriptional activity.""","""['Sophie E Ruff', 'Nikita Vasilyev', 'Evgeny Nudler', 'Susan K Logan', 'Michael J Garabedian']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Commun Biol""","""['Phosphorylation of the androgen receptor by PIM1 in hormone refractory prostate cancer.', 'Differential regulation of androgen receptor by PIM-1 kinases via phosphorylation-dependent recruitment of distinct ubiquitin E3 ligases.', 'Pim1 promotes human prostate cancer cell tumorigenicity and c-MYC transcriptional activity.', 'Androgen Receptor and PIM1 Expression in Tumor Tissue of Patients With Triple-negative Breast Cancer.', 'PIM1 kinase as a target in prostate cancer: roles in tumorigenesis, castration resistance, and docetaxel resistance.', 'Targeting Pim kinases in hematological cancers: molecular and clinical review.']"""

The mechanism of how prostate cancer initiates and develops is still not clear. Here in this study, we show that tumor suppressor ZBTB38 could suppress the migration and proliferation of prostate cancer cells. We find lower ZBTB38 expression in prostate cancer tissues, which also strongly predicts a poorer prognosis of prostate cancer. ZBTB38 binds DKK1 (Dickkopf WNT signaling pathway inhibitor 1) locus and promotes DKK1 expression in prostate cancer cell lines. Consistently, reduction of DKK1 expression significantly restores ZBTB38-mediated suppression of migration and proliferation of prostate cancer cell lines. Mechanistically, we find that ZBTB38 primarily binds the promoters of target genes, and differentially regulates the expression of 1818 genes. We also identify PRKDC (protein kinase, DNA-activated, catalytic subunit) as a ZBTB38-interacting protein that could repress the function of ZBTB38 in suppressing migration and proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Taken together, our results indicate that ZBTB38 could repress cell migration and proliferation in prostate cancer via promoting DKK1 expression, and also provide evidence supporting ZBTB38 as a potential prognosis marker for prostate cancer.""","""['Guanxiong Ding#', 'Wei Lu#', 'Qing Zhang#', 'Kai Li', 'Huihui Zhou', 'Fei Wang', 'Chunchun Zhao', 'Caibin Fan', 'Jianqing Wang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['The role of ZBTB38 in promoting migration and invasive growth of bladder cancer cells.', 'Long non-coding RNA LINC01133 silencing exerts antioncogenic effect in pancreatic cancer through the methylation of DKK1 promoter and the activation of Wnt signaling pathway.', 'Dickkopf-1 is down-regulated by MYCN and inhibits neuroblastoma cell proliferation.', 'REST-repressed lncRNA NPPA-AS1 regulates cervical cancer progression by modulating miR-302e/DKK1/Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.', 'Dickkopf-1: A Promising Target for Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'Profound Effects of Dexamethasone on the Immunological State, Synthesis and Secretion Capacity of Human Testicular Peritubular Cells.', 'Context-dependent CpG methylation directs cell-specific binding of transcription factor ZBTB38.', 'Large-Scale Chromatin Rearrangements in Cancer.']"""

The global burden of colorectal cancer is projected to increase to over 2 million new cases with over 1 million deaths within the next 10 years, and there is a great need for new compounds with novel mechanisms of action. Our group has developed protein kinase C (PKC)-modulating isophthalic acid derivatives that induce cytotoxicity toward human cervical and prostate cancer cell lines. In this study, we investigated the effects of 5-(hydroxymethyl)isophthalate 1a3 (HMI-1a3) on colorectal cancer cell lines (Caco-2, Colo205, and HT29). HMI-1a3 inhibited cell proliferation, decreased cell viability, and induced an apoptotic response in all studied cell lines. These effects, however, were independent of PKC. Using serine/threonine kinome profiling and pharmacological kinase inhibitors, we identified activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway as a new mechanism of action for HMI-1a3-induced anticancer activity in colorectal cancer cell lines. Our current results strengthen the hypothesis for HMI-1a3 as a potential anticancer agent against various malignancies. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common solid organ malignancy. This study demonstrates that the protein kinase C (PKC)-C1 domain-targeted isophthalatic acid derivative 5-(hydroxymethyl)isophthalate 1a3 (HMI-1a3) has anticancer activity on CRC cell lines independently of PKC. We identified PKA activation as a mechanism of HMI-1a3-induced anticancer effects. The results reveal a new anticancer mechanism of action for the partial PKC agonist HMI-1a3 and thus provide new insights for the development of PKC and PKA modulators for cancer therapy.""","""['Ilari Tarvainen', 'Rebecca C Nunn', 'Raimo K Tuominen', 'Maria H Jäntti', 'Virpi Talman']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Pharmacol Exp Ther""","""['Correction to ""Protein Kinase A-Mediated Effects of Protein Kinase C Partial Agonist 5-(Hydroxymethyl)Isophthalate 1a3 in Colorectal Cancer Cells"".', 'Evidence for a role of MRCK in mediating HeLa cell elongation induced by the C1 domain ligand HMI-1a3.', 'C1 domain-targeted isophthalates as protein kinase C modulators: structure-based design, structure-activity relationships and biological activities.', 'The C1 domain-targeted isophthalate derivative HMI-1b11 promotes neurite outgrowth and GAP-43 expression through PKCα activation in SH-SY5Y cells.', 'Anticancer activity of the protein kinase C modulator HMI-1a3 in 2D and 3D cell culture models of androgen-responsive and androgen-unresponsive prostate cancer.', 'Interactions between the epidermal growth factor receptor and type I protein kinase A: biological significance and therapeutic implications.', 'Expanding the Paradigm of Structure-Based Drug Design: Molecular Dynamics Simulations Support the Development of New Pyridine-Based Protein Kinase C-Targeted Agonists.']"""

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of docetaxel rechallenge in patients with mCRPC.  Patients and methods:   We retrospectively compared patients who had received either first-line docetaxel and rechallenge after Androgen Receptor-axis Targeted therapies (ARAT), to those without rechallenge docetaxel. Multivariate cox-regression analysis was used to evaluate survival.  Results:   Out of the 204 patients with mCRPC enrolled in the study, 24 patients received docetaxel rechallenge and 180 did not. The median overall survival was 50.11 months in the rechallenge group, as compared to 26.36 months in the non-rechallenge group (p of log rank=0.044). In the multivariate model, doxetaxel rechallenge was an independent risk factor for overall survival [hazard ratio (HR)=0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.32-0.99], together with the performance status score 2 (HR=2.46, 95%CI=1.32-4.58), hormone-sensitive state duration (HR=0.99, 95%CI=0.99-0.999), liver (HR=1.90, 95%CI=1.04-3.47) and brain metastases (HR=2.23, 95%CI=1.26-5.46). The advantage of rechallenge was addressed in the androgen receptor-axis-targeted (ARAT) non-responsive patients (HR=0.36, 95%CI=0.17-0.78).

However, the roles of circRNAs in the metastasis of PCa remain unclear. In the present study, differentially expressed circRNAs associated with PCa metastasis were screened using high-throughput RNA sequencing, from which hsa_circ_0004296 was identified.  Methods:   Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of circ_0004296 in PCa tissues and adjacent normal tissues as well as in blood and urine. Gain and loss of function experiments were performed to investigate the function of circ_0004296 in PCa. Bioinformatics analyses, RNA pull-down assay, and mass spectrometry were conducted to identify RNA-binding proteins. RNA immunoprecipitation and RNA and protein nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionation were performed to investigate the underlying mechanism. A xenograft mouse model was used to analyze the effect of circ_0004296 on PCa growth and metastasis in vivo.  Results:   The expression of circ_0004296 was decreased in PCa tissues, blood, and urine, which was negatively associated with metastasis. Furthermore, gain and loss of function experiments in vitro and in vivo showed that circ_0004296 inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of PCa cells. Mechanistically, circ_0004296 regulated host gene ETS1 expression at the post-transcriptional level. EIF4A3 was identified and confirmed as the downstream binding protein of circ_0004296. EIF4A3 expression was significantly upregulated in PCa tissues and associated with PCa metastasis. Silencing EIF4A3 suppressed PCa cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT.  Conclusions:   Circ_0004296 overexpression efficiently inhibited ETS1 mRNA nuclear export by promoting EIF4A3 retention in the nucleus, leading to the downregulation of ETS1 expression and suppression of PCa metastasis; thus, circ_0004296 might be a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for patients with PCa.""","""['Shiyu Mao#', 'Wentao Zhang#', 'Fuhan Yang#', 'Yadong Guo#', 'Hong Wang', 'Yuan Wu', 'Ruiliang Wang', 'Niraj Maskey', 'Zongtai Zheng', 'Cheng Li', 'Wenchao Ma', 'Junfeng Zhang', 'Yang Yan', 'Xudong Yao']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['EIF4A3-induced circ_0084615 contributes to the progression of colorectal cancer via miR-599/ONECUT2 pathway.', 'hsa_circ_0101119 facilitates the progression of cervical cancer via an interaction with EIF4A3 to inhibit TCEAL6 expression.', 'Hsa_circ_0030042 regulates abnormal autophagy and protects atherosclerotic plaque stability by targeting eIF4A3.', 'Emerging roles of circular RNAs in osteoporosis.', 'Curcumin as a therapeutic agent in cancer therapy: Focusing on its modulatory effects on circular RNAs.', 'm6A-modified circABCC4 promotes stemness and metastasis of prostate cancer by recruiting IGF2BP2 to increase stability of CCAR1.', 'EIF4A3 serves as a prognostic and immunosuppressive microenvironment factor and inhibits cell apoptosis in bladder cancer.', 'Understanding the roles and regulation patterns of circRNA on its host gene in tumorigenesis and tumor progression.', 'The function and mechanisms of action of circular RNAs in Urologic Cancer.', 'Circular RNAs in and out of Cells: Therapeutic Usages of Circular RNAs.']"""

Here we examined the correlation between YB-1 and CXCL14, and the ERK/AKT/mTOR pathways in prostate cancer. Knockdown of YB-1 decreased cyclinD1 expression with an upregulation of cleaved-PARP in human prostate cancer cells. EGF treatment upregulated phospho-YB-1 expression in a time-dependent manner, while treatment with an ERK inhibitor completely silenced its expression in prostate cancer cells. EGF treatment stimulates CyclinD1 and YB-1 phosphorylation in an ERK-dependent pathway. Positive and negative regulation of YB-1 and CXCL14 was observed after EGF treatment in prostate cancer cells, respectively. EGF rescues cell cycle and apoptosis via the AKT and ERK pathways. Furthermore, YB-1 silencing induces G1 arrest and apoptosis, while knockdown of CXCL14 facilitates cell growth and inhibits apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. YB-1 and CXCL14 were inversely correlated in prostate cancer cells and tissues.

In this paper, we develop a computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) system for automated grade groups (GG) classification using digitized prostate biopsy specimens (PBSs). Our CAD system aims to firstly classify the Gleason pattern (GP), and then identifies the Gleason score (GS) and GG. The GP classification pipeline is based on a pyramidal deep learning system that utilizes three convolution neural networks (CNN) to produce both patch- and pixel-wise classifications. The analysis starts with sequential preprocessing steps that include a histogram equalization step to adjust intensity values, followed by a PBSs' edge enhancement. The digitized PBSs are then divided into overlapping patches with the three sizes: 100 × 100 (CNNS), 150 × 150 (CNNM), and 200 × 200 (CNNL), pixels, and 75% overlap. Those three sizes of patches represent the three pyramidal levels. This pyramidal technique allows us to extract rich information, such as that the larger patches give more global information, while the small patches provide local details. After that, the patch-wise technique assigns each overlapped patch a label as GP categories (1 to 5). Then, the majority voting is the core approach for getting the pixel-wise classification that is used to get a single label for each overlapped pixel. The results after applying those techniques are three images of the same size as the original, and each pixel has a single label. We utilized the majority voting technique again on those three images to obtain only one. The proposed framework is trained, validated, and tested on 608 whole slide images (WSIs) of the digitized PBSs. The overall diagnostic accuracy is evaluated using several metrics: precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, macro-averaged, and weighted-averaged. The (CNNL) has the best accuracy results for patch classification among the three CNNs, and its classification accuracy is 0.76. The macro-averaged and weighted-average metrics are found to be around 0.70-0.77. For GG, our CAD results are about 80% for precision, and between 60% to 80% for recall and F1-score, respectively. Also, it is around 94% for accuracy and NPV. To highlight our CAD systems' results, we used the standard ResNet50 and VGG-16 to compare our CNN's patch-wise classification results. As well, we compared the GG's results with that of the previous work.""","""['Kamal Hammouda', 'Fahmi Khalifa', 'Moumen El-Melegy', 'Mohamed Ghazal', 'Hanan E Darwish', 'Mohamed Abou El-Ghar', 'Ayman El-Baz']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Sensors (Basel)""","""['Multi-Stage Classification-Based Deep Learning for Gleason System Grading Using Histopathological Images.', 'Comparison of Artificial Intelligence Techniques to Evaluate Performance of a Classifier for Automatic Grading of Prostate Cancer From Digitized Histopathologic Images.', 'Deep learning for automatic Gleason pattern classification for grade group determination of prostate biopsies.', 'Deep learning for colon cancer histopathological images analysis.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.', 'Multi-Stage Classification-Based Deep Learning for Gleason System Grading Using Histopathological Images.', 'Special Issue ""Computer Aided Diagnosis Sensors"".', 'A Deep Learning Model for Prostate Adenocarcinoma Classification in Needle Biopsy Whole-Slide Images Using Transfer Learning.']"""

Objectives:   Our objective was to investigate the associations between FODMAP intake (total and by type) and cancer risk (overall, breast, prostate, and colorectal) in a large prospective cohort.  Methods:   The study was based on the NutriNet-Santé cohort (2009-2020); 104,909 adult participants without cancer at baseline were included in our analyses (median follow-up time = 7.7 y, 78.7% women, mean ± SD age at baseline 42.1 ± 14.5 y). Baseline dietary intakes were obtained from repeated 24-h dietary records linked to a detailed food composition table.

Epicatechin gallate, an active compound of green tea, has been reported to modulate lipid metabolism. In this research, the potential role of epicatechin gallate in prostate cancer cells was evaluated. The results indicated that epicatechin gallate downregulates the expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, ATP citrate lyase, and fatty acid synthase in prostate cancer cells and prostate xenograft tissues, suggesting that epicatechin gallate can inhibit de novo fatty acid synthesis. Moreover, epicatechin gallate significantly restrains the migration rather than the viability of prostate cancer cells. PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which exhibits regulatory effect on lipogenesis, is also inhibited under epicatechin gallate treatment, while pretreatment with AKT activator SC79 or mTOR activator MHY1485 blocks the inhibitory effect of epicatechin gallate on the expression of lipogenic genes and the migration of prostate cancer cells.

However, it is unclear if there is clinical benefit from anterior column resection in addition to simple epidural debulking prior to stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).  Purpose:   To examine the effect of anterior column debulking versus epidural disease resection alone in the local control of metastases to the bony spine.  Study design:   Retrospective cohort study.  Patient sample:   Ninety-seven patients who underwent open surgery followed by SBRT for spinal metastases at a single comprehensive cancer center.  Outcome measures:   Local tumor recurrence following surgery and SBRT.  Methods:   Data were collected regarding radiation dose, cancer histology, extent of anterior column resection, and recurrence. Tumor involvement was categorized using the International Spine Radiosurgery Consortium guidelines. Univariable analyses were conducted to determine predictors of local recurrence and time to local recurrence.  Results:   Among the 97 included patients, mean age was 60.5±11.4 years and 51% of patients were male. The most common primary tumor types were lung (20.6%), breast (17.5%), kidney (13.4%) and prostate (12.4%). Recurrence was seen in 17 patients (17.5%) and local control rates were: 85.5% (1-year), 81.1% (2-year), and 54.9% (5-year). Overall predictors of local recurrence were tumor pathology (p<.01; renal cell carcinoma and colorectal adenocarcinoma associated with poorest PFS) and undergoing anterior column debulking versus epidural decompression-alone (p=.03). Only tumor pathology predicted time to local recurrence (p<.01), though inspection of Kaplan-Meier functions showed superior long-term local control in patients with radiosensitive tumor pathologies, no previous irradiation of the metastasis, and who underwent anterior column resection versus epidural removal alone. Median time to recurrence was 288 days with 100% of lesions showing anterior column recurrence and recurrence in the epidural space.  Conclusions:   With the increasing shift towards surgery as a neoadjuvant to radiotherapy for patients with spinal column metastases, the role for surgical debulking has become less clear. In the present study, we find that anterior column debulking as opposed to epidural debulking-alone decreases the odds of local recurrence and improves long-term local control.""","""['Zach Pennington', 'Sutipat Pairojboriboon', 'Xuguang Chen', 'Amanda Sacino', 'Aladine A Elsamadicy', 'Rafael de la Garza Ramos', 'Jaimin Patel', 'Benjamin D Elder', 'Lawrence R Kleinberg', 'Daniel M Sciubba', 'Kristin J Redmond', 'Sheng-Fu Larry Lo']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Spine J""","""['Local disease control for spinal metastases following ""separation surgery"" and adjuvant hypofractionated or high-dose single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery: outcome analysis in 186 patients.', 'Stereotactic radiosurgery for spinal metastases with or without separation surgery.', 'Local disease control after decompressive surgery and adjuvant high-dose single-fraction radiosurgery for spine metastases.', 'Stereotactic body radiation therapy and minimally invasive surgery in the management of spinal metastases: a change in the paradigm.', 'Reirradiation spine stereotactic body radiation therapy for spinal metastases: systematic review.', ""An Updated Review on the Treatment Strategy for Spinal Metastasis from the Spine Surgeon's Perspective."", 'Separation surgery followed by stereotactic ablative radiotherapy for metastatic epidural spinal cord compression: A systematic review and meta-analysis for local progression rate.']"""

Median follow-up for men without BCR was 50.4 months (interquartile range, IQR 11.9-95.5). The extended model had a significant better fit, χ2(4) = 31.0, p < 0.001 than the baseline model. The AUC of the 3- and 5-year extended model was 0.85 (95% CI 0.81-0.88) compared to 0.83 (95% CI 0.79-0.87) for the baseline model. Importantly, the presence of cribriform growth in the primary tumor, and GG ≥ 2 at PSM were associated with a higher risk on BCR. In conclusion, the addition of pathological variables improved the prediction of the risk on BCR after RP slightly. However, the clinical implications of this model are important.""","""['Sebastiaan Remmers', 'Eva Hollemans', 'Daan Nieboer', 'Henk B Luiting', 'Geert J L H van Leenders', 'Jozien Helleman', 'Monique J Roobol']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Ann Diagn Pathol""","""['Prognostic Implications of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Concomitant Systematic Biopsy in Predicting Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy in Prostate Cancer Patients Diagnosed with Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Biopsy.', 'The presence of prostate-specific antigen checked more than 1 year before diagnostic biopsy is an independent prognostic factor in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'The impact of the extent and location of positive surgical margins on the risk of biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy in men with Gleason 7 prostate cancers.', 'The importance of surgical margins in prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic Value of Gleason Score at Positive Surgical Margin in Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Is cribriform pattern in prostate biopsy a risk factor for metastatic disease on 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT?', 'The Effect of Adverse Surgical Margins on the Risk of Biochemical Recurrence after Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

A newly developed 5x multiplex (MPX) IHC staining of five different IHC markers (Basal cell cocktail (34βE12 + p63), p504s (SP116), ERG (EPR3864), Ki-67 (30-9), PSMA (EP192)) was applied on whole sections of n = 37 radical prostatectomies (RPE) including normal and cancerous tissue. Four different colors including brown, magenta, yellow and teal coded for different stainings, whereas magenta was used twice for nuclear Ki-67 and cytosolic / membranous PSMA. The staining of multiplex IHC was compared to single stains of ERG, PSMA and p504s. The proper staining of the basal cell cocktail and Ki-67 could be assessed by internal positive controls in the multiplex staining. The proportion of PSMA and p504s expression revealed a significant correlation between multiplex and single stains (p < 0.01) as well as a concordant staining pattern for ERG (n = 14 prostate cancers were identified ERG positive with both methods).

Participants and methods:   The study included a single-centre prospective cohort of 882 patients presenting for radical prostatectomy from 2009 to 2018. Data on total testosterone (TT), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and calculated free testosterone (cFT) were prospectively collected. Stepwise logistic regression models were used to assess correlations of TT and cFT with pathological Gleason Grade Group (GGG), extraprostatic extension (EPE), seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) and biochemical recurrence (BCR).  Results:   Total testosterone remained nearly constant across decades (40s-80s): 0.09 decrease/year (R = 0.02), while SHBG increased 0.87/year (R = 0.32) and cFT decreased 0.08/year (R = -0.02).

Methods:   Immunohistochemical staining was performed on tissue from urological surgery of 10 patients. Further, patients treated for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) at specialized care-units of a university hospital were assessed for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in urinary samples via PCR, disease severity (WHO score), inflammatory response of patients. Finally, the stability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in urine was analyzed.  Results:   High ACE-2 expression (3/3) was observed in the tubules of the kidney and prostate glands, moderate expression in urothelial cells of the bladder (0-2/3) and no expression in kidney glomeruli, muscularis of the bladder and stroma of the prostate (0/3). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 5/199 urine samples from 64 patients. Viral RNA was detected in the first urinary sample of sequential samples. Viral RNA load from other specimen as nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) or endotracheal aspirates revealed higher levels than from urine. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in urine was not associated with impaired WHO score (median 5, range 3-8 vs median 4, range 1-8, p = 0.314), peak white blood cell count (median 24.1 × 1000/ml, range 5.19-48.1 versus median 11.9 × 1000/ml, range 2.9-60.3, p = 0.307), peak CRP (median 20.7 mg/dl, 4.2-40.2 versus median 11.9 mg/dl, range 0.1-51.9, p = 0.316) or peak IL-6 levels (median: 1442 ng/ml, range 26.7-3918 versus median 140 ng/ml, range 3.0-11,041, p = 0.099).

Our Institution's database was analysed for false-positive frozen-section (FS) margins as confirmed on paraffin histopathological analysis: functional outcomes of potency, continence, and biochemical recurrence (BCR). The median (range) of console time was 145 (90-300) min. In our cohort, positive FS was seen in 30.7% (160/520) of patients, with a confirmatory paraffin analysis in 91.8% of our patients' cohort (147/160). The neurovascular bundles (NVBs) that underwent secondary resection contained tumour in 26.8% (43/160) of the cases. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) was 6.7% (35/520), of which FS was positive in 40% (14/35) of those cases. There were insufficient evidence of a statistical association of urinary incontinence and positive surgical margin rates according to NS or NVB resection. NeuroSAFE enables intraoperative confirmation of the oncologic safety of a NS procedure. Patients with a positive FS on NeuroSAFE can be converted to a negative surgical margin (NSM) by ipsilateral wide resection.

Currently, direct contact with potential participants is required for evaluating risk. A way to reduce the number of ineligible people contacted might be to apply risk-prediction models directly to digital primary care data, but model performance in this setting is unknown.  Method:   The Clinical Practice Research Datalink, a computerised, longitudinal primary care database, was used to evaluate the Liverpool Lung Project V.2 (LLPv2) and Prostate Lung Colorectal and Ovarian (modified 2012) (PLCOm2012) models. Lung cancer occurrence over 5-6 years was measured in ever-smokers aged 50-80 years and compared with 5-year (LLPv2) and 6-year (PLCOm2012) predicted risk.  Results:   Over 5 and 6 years, 7123 and 7876 lung cancers occurred, respectively, from a cohort of 842 109 ever-smokers. After recalibration, LLPV2 produced a c-statistic of 0.700 (0.694-0.710), but mean predicted risk was over-estimated (predicted: 4.61%, actual: 0.9%). PLCOm2012 showed similar performance (c-statistic: 0.679 (0.673-0.685), predicted risk: 3.76%. Applying risk-thresholds of 1% (LLPv2) and 0.15% (PLCOm2012), would avoid contacting 42.7% and 27.4% of ever-smokers who did not develop lung cancer for screening eligibility assessment, at the cost of missing 15.6% and 11.4% of lung cancers.  Conclusion:   Risk-prediction models showed only moderate discrimination when applied to routinely collected primary care data, which may be explained by quality and completeness of data. However, they may substantially reduce the number of people for initial evaluation of screening eligibility, at the cost of missing some lung cancers.

These associations have not been reported simultaneously for common mCRPC genomic biomarkers.  Objective:   To evaluate predictive associations of common genomic aberrations in mCRPC using an established comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) system.  Design, setting, and participants:   A retrospective cohort study used data from a deidentified US-based clinicogenomic database comprising patients treated in routine clinical practice between 2011 and 2020, evaluated with Foundation Medicine CGP in tissue biopsies obtained around the time of treatment decision. The main cohort included 180 NHT and 179 taxane lines of therapy (LOTs) from 308 unique patients. The sequential cohort comprised a subset of the main cohort NHT LOTs immediately followed by taxane from 55 unique patients.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, time to next treatment (TTNT), and overall survival (OS) were assessed. Main cohort analyses were adjusted for known treatment assignment biases via inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) in treatment interaction models.  Results and limitations:   In the main cohort, patients with AR amplification (ARamp) or PTEN aberrations (PTENalt) had worse relative PSA response on NHT versus taxanes compared with patients without. Patients with ARamp, PTENalt, or RB1 aberrations (RB1alt) also had worse relative TTNT and OS on NHT but not on taxanes. In multivariable models for TTNT and OS adjusted via IPTW, ARamp, PTENalt, and RB1alt were shown as poor prognostic factors overall and demonstrated significant treatment interactions, indicating reduced hazards of therapy switch and death on taxanes versus NHT. Consistent associations favoring increased benefit from subsequent taxane despite prior NHT treatment line were observed only for ARamp in the sequential cohort, in which very few patients had RB1alt for assessment.

The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of the development and training of a deep learning object detection model for automating the assessment of fiducial marker migration and tracking of the prostate in radiotherapy patients.Methods and Materials. A fiducial marker detection model was trained on the YOLO v2 detection framework using approximately 20,000 pelvis kV projection images with fiducial markers labelled. The ability of the trained model to detect marker positions was validated by tracking the motion of markers in a respiratory phantom and comparing detection data with the expected displacement from a reference position. Marker migration was then assessed in 14 prostate radiotherapy patients using the detector for comparison with previously conducted studies. This was done by determining variations in intermarker distance between the first and subsequent fractions in each patient.Results. On completion of training, a detection model was developed that operated at a 96% detection efficacy and with a root mean square error of 0.3 pixels. By determining the displacement from a reference position in a respiratory phantom, experimentally and with the detector it was found that the detector was able to compute displacements with a mean accuracy of 97.8% when compared to the actual values. Interfraction marker migration was measured in 14 patients and the average and maximum±standard deviation marker migration were found to be2.0±0.9mmand2.3±0.9mm,respectively.Conclusion. This study demonstrates the benefits of pairing deep learning object detection, and image-guided radiotherapy and how a workflow to automate the assessment of organ motion and seed migration during prostate radiotherapy can be developed. The high detection efficacy and low error make evident the advantages of using a pre-trained model to automate the assessment of the target volume positional variation and the migration of fiducial markers between fractions.""","""['Ryan Motley', 'Prabhakar Ramachandran', 'Andrew Fielding']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biomed Phys Eng Express""","""['A deep learning framework for automatic detection of arbitrarily shaped fiducial markers in intrafraction fluoroscopic images.', 'Characterization of a novel liquid fiducial marker for multimodal image guidance in stereotactic body radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'A generative adversarial network-based (GAN-based) architecture for automatic fiducial marker detection in prostate MRI-only radiotherapy simulation images.', 'Fiducial markers and spacers in prostate radiotherapy: current applications.', 'Designing a Simple Fiducial Marker for Localization in Spatial Scenes Using Neural Networks.', 'Research progress on deep learning in magnetic resonance imaging-based diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer: a review on the current status and perspectives.']"""

P-AR begins expression in association with prostatic development and castration decreases its expression levels in the mouse prostate. Functional analysis of AR in prostate cancer PC-3 cells showed ligand-induced AR nuclear translocation and transactivation were disturbed by its phosphorylation at Ser815. Moreover, P-AR suppressed oncogenic AKT signaling suggesting a suppressive function for prostate cancer development. In fact, AR phosphorylation levels progressively decrease in human prostates as cancer worsens. These findings showed androgen might utilize P-AR to self-antagonize oncogenic signals and cancer progression believed to be regulated by non-phosphorylated AR (NonP-AR).

In this paper, we further investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-PCa effect of evodiamine. In the present study, cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion were assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), colony formation, and transwell assays, respectively. Animal studies were used to evaluate the effect of evodiamine on the tumorigenicity of LNCaP cells in vivo. The expression levels of steroid receptor coactivator (Src), androgene receptor (AR), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were detected by western blot, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) or ELISA assay. Association between Src and AR was examined by Co-Immunoprecipitation (CoIP). The impact of evodiamine on AR-mediated transcriptional activity was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay. The results showed that evodiamine reduced LNCaP and 22Rv1 cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion induced by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in vitro, as well as diminished tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, evodiamine directly targeted Src and reduced DHT-induced Src activation. Moreover, the restoration of Src activation abolished evodiamine-mediated suppression of proliferation, migration, and invasion of DHT-treated LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. Furthermore, evodiamine inhibited DHT-induced AR transcriptional activity through targeting Src. As a conclusion, our findings demonstrate the antitumor property of evodiamine in PCa by blocking AR transcriptional activity through targeting Src and provide a rationale for developing evodiamine as a promising antitumor agent against PCa.""","""['Pei Cheng', 'Xiaofan Zhang', 'Xiaofu Wang', 'Changwei Liu', 'Xinghua Zhao', 'Junfang Fan', 'Changbao Xu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Endocrine""","""['Changes in androgen receptor nongenotropic signaling correlate with transition of LNCaP cells to androgen independence.', 'Evaluation of the effects of androgenic Chinese herbal medicines on androgen receptors and tumor growth in experimental prostate cancer models.', 'Comparison of prostate cancer cell lines for androgen receptor-mediated reporter gene assays.', 'Neoisoliquiritin exerts tumor suppressive effects on prostate cancer by repressing androgen receptor activity.', 'Evodiamine as an anticancer agent: a comprehensive review on its therapeutic application, pharmacokinetic, toxicity, and metabolism in various cancers.', 'Traditional Chinese medicine inhibits PD-1/PD-L1 axis to sensitize cancer immunotherapy: a literature review.', 'Cypermethrin inhibits proliferation of Sertoli cells through AR involving DAB2IP/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in vitro.']"""

Accumulation of isoprenoid metabolites after bisphosphonate treatment allows Vγ2Vδ2 T cells to recognize and kill tumors independently of their MHC expression or burden of non-synonymous mutations. Clinical trials with more than 400 patients show that adoptive immunotherapy with Vγ2Vδ2 T cells has few side effects but has resulted in only a few partial and complete remissions. Here, we have tested Vγ2Vδ2 T cells for expression of inhibitory receptors and determined whether adding PD-1 checkpoint blockade to adoptively transferred Vγ2Vδ2 T cells enhances immunity to human PC-3 prostate tumors in an NSG mouse model. We find that Vγ2Vδ2 T cells express PD-1, CTLA-4, LAG-3, and TIM-3 inhibitory receptors during the 14-day ex vivo expansion period, and PD-1, LAG-3, and TIM-3 upon subsequent stimulation by pamidronate-treated tumor cells. Expression of PD-L1 on PC-3 prostate cancer cells was increased by co-culture with activated Vγ2Vδ2 T cells. Importantly, anti-PD-1 mAb treatment enhanced Vγ2Vδ2 T cell immunity to PC-3 tumors in immunodeficient NSG mice, reducing tumor volume nearly to zero after 5 weeks.

Identification of modifiable risk factors for lethal prostate cancer is challenging given the long natural history of this disease and difficulty of prospectively identifying lethal cancers.  Methods:   Mass spectrometry was performed on baseline serum samples collected from 173 lethal prostate cancer cases and 519 controls enrolled in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening trial. Baseline serum levels of choline, carnitine, betaine, γ-butyrobetaine, crotonobetaine, phenylacetylglutamine, hippuric acid, and p-cresol sulfate were quantified and analyzed by quartile. Conditional multivariable logistic regression analysis associated analyte levels with lethal prostate cancer incidence after adjusting for body mass index and PSA. The Cochran-Armitage test evaluated analyte level trends across quartiles.  Results:   Relative to those in the first quartile, cases with the highest baseline levels of choline (Q4 OR: 2.19; 95% CI, 1.23-3.90; P-trend: 0.005) and betaine (Q4 OR: 1.86; 95% CI, 1.05-3.30; P-trend: 0.11) exhibited increased odds of developing lethal prostate cancer.

Results: Interference with β1I combined with 223Ra reduced PC3 cell growth in bone and significantly improved overall mouse survival, whereas no change was achieved in C4-2B tumors. Anti-β1I treatment decreased the PC3 tumor cell mitosis index and spatially expanded 223Ra lethal effects 2-fold, in vivo and in silico.

Vaginal and/or rectal complications were however reported, due to the close proximity to the implanted volume. We investigated the dosimetric impact of a vaginal spacer in terms of rectal and vaginal doses.  Methods and patients:   Medical records of 12 consecutive female patients with bladder neck RMS, median age 32 months (range: 1.3-6 years), were reviewed. Five patients were treated prior to 2017 without a vaginal spacer and seven patients treated after 2017 had their brachytherapy delivered with a vaginal spacer placed at time of implant.  Results:   Minimal doses delivered to the most exposed 2cm3, 1cm3, and 0.5cm3 of the rectum were all statistically significantly lower among patients treated with a vaginal spacer, as compared to those treated without a spacer. Median rectal D2cm3 was 22GyEQD2 versus 38GyEQD2 (P=0.02), D1cm3 was 29GyEQD2 versus 51GyEQD2 (P=0.013), and D0.5cm3 was 32GyEQD2 versus 61GyEQD2 (P=0.017), with and without the vaginal spacer, respectively. The posterior vaginal wall D0.5cm3 dose was also significantly decreased, with median D0.5cm3 of 92GyEQD2 versus 54GyEQD2 (P<0.0001), with and without the spacer, respectively. Acute tolerance was excellent in all patients, with no need for replanning and no acute complication.  Conclusions:   The use of vaginal spacers in brachytherapy of female pediatric patients with bladder neck RMS resulted in significantly decreased doses to the rectum and the posterior vaginal wall. Though the clinical impact of such dose reduction remains undemonstrated, routine utilization of a vaginal spacer could be a method to decrease long-term morbidity in these patients.""","""['E J Limkin', 'F Guérin', 'S Espenel', 'M Terlizzi', 'H Martelli', 'C Haie-Meder', 'V Minard', 'C Chargari']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Radiother""","""['Pulsed-dose rate brachytherapy for pediatric bladder prostate rhabdomyosarcoma: Compliance and early clinical results.', 'Bladder-Rectum Spacer Balloon versus Vaginal Gauze Packing in High Dose Rate Brachytherapy in Cervical Cancer: A Randomised Study.

The goal of this study was to characterize urinary toxicity outcomes according to urethral dose administered during prostate SBRT.  Methods and materials:   The MEDLINE (PubMed) database was searched for published prospective studies of prostate SBRT through August 2020 that documented a maximum urethral dose metric (MUDM). Reported acute and late urinary toxicity rates were collected. Logistic regression and weighted Pearson correlation models were used to assess associations between urinary toxicity rates and MUDM.  Results:   Twenty-three unique studies (n = 2232 patients) met the inclusion criteria and included a wide range of MUDMs (equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions [EQD2]: 69-141.75 Gy; α/β = 3 Gy). The median follow-up ranged from 3 to 67 months (median, 32 months). On logistic regression analysis, the MUDM EQD2 was significantly associated with multiple urinary toxicity endpoints, including acute grade (G) 2+ (odds ratio [OR], 1.02; P < .001), late G2+ (OR, 1.03; P < .0001), and late G3+ (OR, 1.04; P = .003) urinary toxicity. On weighted Pearson correlation analysis, the MUDM was more closely associated with all evaluated urinary toxicity endpoints than prescription dose, including acute G2+ (r = 0.51; P = .02), late G2+ (r = 0.9; P < .0001), and late G3+ toxicity (r = 0.7; P = .003). Multivariate analysis accounting for age, prostate size, bladder dosimetry, and baseline urinary function confirmed associations between urinary outcomes and MUDM. Within the studied dose range, each increase of 1 Gy to the MUDM corresponded to a 0.8% and 1.0% increase in acute G2+ and late G2+ toxicity, respectively.  Conclusions:   Radiation dose to the urethra correlates closely with urinary toxicity in patients with prostate cancer treated with SBRT. Attention should be paid to the urethral dose when delivering prostate SBRT to high doses, and approaches for urethral dose reduction warrant further investigation.""","""['Jonathan E Leeman', 'Yu-Hui Chen', 'Paul Catalano', 'Jeremy Bredfeldt', 'Martin King', 'Kent W Mouw', ""Anthony V D'Amico"", 'Peter Orio', 'Paul L Nguyen', 'Neil Martin']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Intraprostatic Urethra: The New Kid on the Block for Prostate Cancer Radiation Therapy?', 'Five-Year Outcomes of a Phase 1 Dose-Escalation Study Using Stereotactic Body Radiosurgery for Patients With Low-Risk and Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Acute genitourinary toxicity after high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: correlation between the urethral dose in HDR brachytherapy and the severity of acute genitourinary toxicity.', 'Virtual HDR CyberKnife treatment for localized prostatic carcinoma: dosimetry comparison with HDR brachytherapy and preliminary clinical observations.', 'SBRT in pancreatic cancer: what is the therapeutic window?', 'Stereotactic body radiotherapy for primary prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'The use of a thin guide-wire for urethral definition in prostate SBRT treatments with Cyberknife.', 'Deep learning-based segmentation of prostatic urethra on computed tomography scans for treatment planning.', 'Health-related quality of life of salvage prostate reirradiation using stereotactic ablative radiotherapy with urethral-sparing.', 'Urinary toxicity after salvage re-irradiation for prostate cancer local failure after definitive radiotherapy: a clinical and dosimetric prognostic factors analysis.', 'Urethral Interfractional Geometric and Dosimetric Variations of Prostate Cancer Patients: A Study Using an Onboard MRI.']"""

Objective:   To determine DNA repair genes associated with localized PrCa in a diverse academic biobank and to determine genetic testing burden.  Design, setting, and participants:   A cross-sectional study of 2391 localized PrCa patients was carried out.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Genetic ancestry and mutation rates (excluding somatic interference) in 17 DNA repair genes were determined in 1588 localized PrCa patients and 3273 cancer-free males. Burden testing within individuals of genetically determined European (EUR) and African (AFR) ancestry was performed between biobank PrCa cases and cancer-free biobank and gnomAD males.  Results and limitations:   AFR individuals with localized PrCa had lower DNA repair gene mutation rates than EUR individuals (1.4% vs 4.0%, p = 0.02). Mutation rates in localized PrCa patients were similar to those in biobank and gnomAD controls (EUR: 4.0% vs 2.8%, p = 0.15, vs 3.1%, p = 0.04; AFR: 1.4% vs 1.8%, p = 0.8, vs 2.1%, p = 0.5). Gene-based rare variant association testing revealed that only BRCA2 mutations were significantly enriched compared with gnomAD controls of EUR ancestry (1.0% vs 0.28%, p = 0.03). Of the participants, 21% and 11% met high-risk and very-high-risk criteria; of them, 3.7% and 6.2% had any germline genetic mutation and 1.0% and 2.5% had a BRCA2 mutation, respectively. Limitations of this study include an analysis of a relatively small, single-institution cohort.  Conclusions:   DNA repair gene germline mutation rates are low in an academic biobank cohort of localized PrCa patients, particularly among individuals of AFR genetic ancestry. Mutation rates in genes with published evidence of association with PrCa exceed 2.5% only in high-risk, very-high-risk localized, and node-positive PrCa patients. These findings highlight the importance of risk stratification in localized PrCa patients to identify appropriate patients for germline genetic testing.  Patient summary:   In the majority of patients who develop localized prostate cancer, germline genetic testing is unlikely to reveal an inherited DNA repair mutation, regardless of race. High-risk features increase the possibility of a germline DNA repair mutation.""","""['Daniel J Lee', 'Ryan Hausler', 'Anh N Le', 'Gregory Kelly', 'Jacquelyn Powers', 'James Ding', 'Emily Feld', 'Heena Desai', 'Casey Morrison', 'Abigail Doucette', 'Peter Gabriel', 'Regeneron Genetics Center', 'Renae L Judy', 'Joellen Weaver', 'Rachel Kember', 'Scott M Damrauer', 'Daniel J Rader', 'Susan M Domchek', 'Vivek Narayan', 'Lauren E Schwartz', 'Kara N Maxwell']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Continuing the Evolution of Germline Genetics in Prostate Cancer: Tailoring Testing To Enhance Patient Care.', 'Re: Daniel J.

Moracin D augmented cytotoxicity and sub G1 population in PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells, while DU145 cells were more susceptible to Moracin D than PC3 cells. Moracin D attenuated the expression of caspase-3, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and B-cell lymphoma-extra-large (Bcl-xL) in DU145 cells. Consistently, Moracin D significantly augmented the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells in DU145 cells. Interestingly, Moracin D activated PPAR-γ and phospho-protein kinase C delta (p-PKC-δ) and inhibited phospho-protein kinase C alpha (p-PKC-α) in DU145 cells. Furthermore, STRING bioinformatic analysis reveals that PPAR-γ interacts with nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) that binds to PKC-α/PKC-δ or protein kinase B (AKT) or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Indeed, Moracin D decreased phosphorylation of NF-κB, ERK, and AKT in DU145 cells. Conversely, PPAR-γ inhibitor GW9662 reduced the apoptotic ability of Moracin D to activate caspase 3 and PARP in DU145 cells. Taken together, these findings provide a novel insight that activation of PPAR-γ/p-PKC-δ and inhibition of p-PKC-α are critically involved in Moracin D-induced apoptosis in DU145 prostate cancer cells.""","""['Jae Seok Yoon', 'Hyo-Jung Lee', 'Deok Yong Sim', 'Eunji Im', 'Ji Eon Park', 'Woon Yi Park', 'Ja Il Koo', 'Bum Sang Shim', 'Sung-Hoon Kim']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Phytother Res""","""['Inhibition of Wnt3a/FOXM1/β-Catenin Axis and Activation of GSK3β and Caspases are Critically Involved in Apoptotic Effect of Moracin D in Breast Cancers.', 'Auraptene Induces Apoptosis via Myeloid Cell Leukemia 1-Mediated Activation of Caspases in PC3 and DU145 Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Inhibition of protein kinase C α/βII and activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase mediate glycyrrhetinic acid induced apoptosis in non-small cell lung cancer NCI-H460 cells.', 'Inhibition of Myeloid Cell Leukemia 1 and Activation of Caspases Are Critically Involved in Gallotannin-induced Apoptosis in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Clinical efficacies, underlying mechanisms and molecular targets of Chinese medicines for diabetic nephropathy treatment and management.', 'The role of lipid metabolic reprogramming in tumor microenvironment.', 'PKCδ promotes the invasion and migration of colorectal cancer through c-myc/NDRG1 pathway.', 'Protein Kinase C (PKC) Isozymes as Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets for Cancer.', 'PPARγ Gene Polymorphisms, Metabolic Disorders, and Coronary Artery Disease.']"""

Radioresistance and stemness are substantial obstacles to TNBC treatment. The THO complex (THOC) is a subunit of the TRanscription-EXport complex that functions in the coupling of transcription to nascent RNA splicing, elongation, and export. However, its role in regulating TNBC therapeutic resistance is not reported yet. In this study, the authors demonstrate that cancer stem cells are enriched in radioresistant TNBC cells and describe the role of the THOC in regulating TNBC radioresistance and stemness. The authors find that THOC2 and THOC5 are upregulated in radioresistant TNBC cells and associated with a poor prognosis in TNBC patients. Further investigation reveals that THOC2 promotes the stem-like properties and radioresistance of TNBC cells in a THOC5-dependent manner by facilitating the release of sex-determining region Y (SRY)-box transcription factor 2 (SOX2) and homeobox transcription factor (NANOG) transcripts from the nucleus. Silencing THOC2 or THOC5 expression decreases the protein expression of SOX2 and NANOG, depletes the stem-like properties, and causes radiosensitization in these TNBC cells. Moreover, THOC2 or THOC5 depletion blocks the xenograft tumorigenesis and growth of radioresistant TNBC in vivo.

In this study, we focused on the correlations between the clinicopathological characteristics and susceptibility of prostate cancer and RAGE single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In 579 prostate cancer patients, the RAGE SNPs rs1800625, rs1800624, rs2070600 and rs184003 in patients with or without grade group upgrade were analysed with real-time polymerase chain reaction. The results demonstrated that the prostate cancer patients who carried the RAGE SNPs rs2070600 'GA' genotypic variants were significantly associated with lower risk to develop grade group upgrade. Moreover, patients with the RAGE rs1800625 'TC + CC' genotypic variants were associated with higher risk of perineural invasion. In 343 prostate cancer patients who carried the RAGE rs1800625 'TC + CC' genotype without grade group upgrade were correlated with higher risk of biochemical recurrence and perineural invasion. In the analysis of TCGA database, significant differences of the RAGE mRNA level were found between the normal controls and prostate cancer patients (p < 0.0001), and the pathologic stage N1 and N0 patients (p = 0.0027). The prostate cancer patients with high RAGE expression were associated with lower overall survival rate (p = 0.025). In conclusion, our results have revealed that the RAGE SNPs rs2070600 and rs1800625 were associated with the grade group upgrade of prostate cancer and clinical status.

However, whether HCG18 functions in PC is still unclear. Therefore, the current study aimed at unveiling the role of HCG18 in PC progression and its regulatory mechanism on the biological behaviors of PC. Here, RT-qPCR was utilized to detect HCG18 expression, and then, functional experiments were conducted to verify the effects of HCG18 on PC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. According to the results, HCG18 was significantly up-regulated in PC cells and it facilitated cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in PC. Furthermore, a series of mechanism experiments were carried out to verify the relationship among HCG18, miR-370-3p, and DEAD-box helicase 3 X-linked(DDX3X) in PC cells. Final rescue assays showed that DDX3X overexpression could reverse the inhibitory function of silencing HCG18 on PC progression.

Although sex steroids are thought to be involved, classical androgen and estrogen receptors are not detectable in most melanomas. Here we show that testosterone promotes melanoma proliferation by activating ZIP9 (SLC39A9), a zinc transporter that is widely expressed in human melanoma but not intentionally targeted by available therapeutics. This testosterone activity required an influx of zinc, activation of MAPK, and nuclear translocation of YAP. FDA-approved inhibitors of the classical androgen receptor also inhibited ZIP9, thereby antagonizing the protumorigenic effects of testosterone in melanoma. In male mice, androgen receptor inhibitors suppressed growth of ZIP9-expressing melanomas but had no effect on isogenic melanomas lacking ZIP9 or on melanomas in females. These data suggest that ZIP9 might be effectively targeted in melanoma and other cancers by repurposing androgen receptor inhibitors that are currently approved only for prostate cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: Testosterone signaling through ZIP9 mediates some of the sex differences in melanoma, and drugs that target AR can be repurposed to block ZIP9 and inhibit melanoma in males.""","""['Cristina Aguirre-Portolés', 'Riley Payne', 'Aspen Trautz', 'J Kevin Foskett', 'Christopher A Natale', 'John T Seykora', 'Todd W Ridky']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Identification and characterization of membrane androgen receptors in the ZIP9 zinc transporter subfamily: II.

Despite their overall tolerable risk profile, certain signals of cardiovascular toxicity were reported for these agents in clinical trials but little is known about their incidence in clinical practice. The objective was to assess the comparative cardiovascular safety of ABI and ENZ in patients with mCRPC in the real-world.  Methods:   A retrospective population-based cohort was extracted from Quebec public healthcare administrative databases. First-time NHA users between 2011 and 2016 were selected. The primary outcome of interest was cardiovascular-related hospitalization (composite outcome that included acute coronary syndrome, cerebrovascular stroke, heart failure, arrhythmia and others). Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) with the propensity score was used to adjust for measured baseline characteristics including pre-existing cardiovascular disease.  Results:   The cohort comprises 2,183 patients, with 1,773 (81.2%) in the ABI group and 410 (18.8%) in the ENZ group. Crude incidence rates of cardiovascular-related hospitalization were of 9.8 events per 100 person-years (PYs) and of 7.1 events per 100 PYs for the ABI and ENZ groups, respectively. The ABI group was at greater risk of cardiovascular-related hospitalization compared to the ENZ group (IPTW-hazard ratio (HR) 1.82; 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 1.09-3.05). The risk of hospitalization for heart failure was greater in ABI (IPTW-HR 2.88; 95%CI 1.09-7.63).  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that ABI users may be at greater risk of cardiovascular-related hospitalization compared to ENZ users, in particular for heart failure. These results provide clinicians with additional insight on the cardiovascular risks of mCRPC patients treated with NHAs in the real-world and further large studies are required to corroborate these findings.""","""['Jason Hu', 'Armen G Aprikian', 'Marie Vanhuyse', 'Alice Dragomir']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Risk of major adverse cardiovascular events among second-line hormonal therapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: A real-world evidence study.', 'Cardiovascular outcomes among patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer: A comparative safety study using US administrative claims data.', 'Duration of Treatment in Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with Abiraterone Acetate or Enzalutamide.', 'Systematic Review of Efficacy and Health Economic Implications of Real-world Treatment Sequencing in Prostate Cancer: Where Do the Newer Agents Enzalutamide and Abiraterone Fit in?', 'Indirect comparison between abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Management of Patients with Advanced Prostate Cancer.

This study is aimed at illustrating the mechanism of sweroside-mediated regulation in bone metastasis in PCa cells. Owing to the limitations of antitumor drugs in terms of their physical and chemical properties, making them into nanomaterials can effectively improve drug stability and bioavailability. Apoptosis was assessed with flow cytometry using the annexin V/propidium iodide binding assay; proteins, including p53, P21, Bcl-2, and Bax; and induction of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Using colony formation assay, sphere formation assay, and the expression changes in CD133 and CD44, stem cell characteristics were assessed. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) activity was accessed by levels of the expression changes of EMT-related markers, vimentin and E-cadherin. Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was examined to detect the levels of the expression changes of snail and β-catenin. PC-3 cells were treated with lithium chloride (LiCl), which is an agonist of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and the levels of CD133, CD44, vimentin, E-cadherin, snail, and β-catenin were detected. T-cell factor/lymphocyte enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) activity in cells overexpressing β-catenin was used to detect the effects on β-catenin transcription, and the expression of c-myc, Cyclin D1, Survivin, and MMP-7 were used to detect Wnt downstream target genes. Our results suggest that sweroside induces apoptosis and intracellular ROS; upregulates apoptotic proteins; and suppresses proliferation, invasion, and migration, preventing stem cell characteristics, including sphere formation, colony formation, and CD133 and CD44 expressions. Furthermore, sweroside nanoparticles exerts inhibitory effects on β-catenin transcription by suppressing TTCF/LEF activity in cells overexpressing β-catenin and downregulation of the expression of Wnt downstream target genes, including c-myc, Cyclin D1, Survivin, and MMP-7. The potential therapeutic effect of sweroside nanoparticles on bone metastatis of PCa was suggested, by these findings.""","""['Sheng Huang', 'Changye Zou', 'Shangyan Xie', 'Bin Wang', 'Xitao LingHu', 'Yixiao Wang', 'Xiaohong Xu', 'Shuai Huang', 'Qingde Wa']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Biomed Nanotechnol""","""['CUL4B promotes metastasis and proliferation in pancreatic cancer cells by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.', 'Fusion of macrophages promotes breast cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion through activating epithelial-mesenchymal transition and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.', 'Ganoderma lucidum Exerts an Anticancer Effect on Human Osteosarcoma Cells via Suppressing the Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathway.', 'Wnt Signaling in the Development of Bone Metastasis.', 'Plant-Derived Chinese Medicine Monomers on Ovarian Cancer via the Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathway: Review of Mechanisms and Prospects.', 'Iridoid Derivatives as Anticancer Agents: An Updated Review from 1970-2022.']"""
