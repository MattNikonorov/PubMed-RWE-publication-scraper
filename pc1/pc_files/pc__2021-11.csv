Studies have shown that PLK1 is upregulated in many tumors and high levels are adversely related to a poor prognosis. Knocking down or inhibiting PLK1 results in synthetic lethality in PTEN deficient prostate tumors and Kras mutant colorectal tumors, further validating PLK1 as an oncotarget. Substrate recognition by PLK1 occurs through the Polo-Box Domain (PBD), which is a phospho-peptide binding site also responsible for subcellular localization. Much effort has been directed to target this kinase therapeutically through the ATP-binding site, and a few such inhibitors have advanced to clinical trials however with limited clinical efficacy. Moreover, it has been shown that a point mutation in PLK1 (C67V) confers dramatic cellular resistance to catalytic site inhibitors. An alternative approach to target PLK1 potently and selectively is through the PBD to block its protein-protein interactions. Through the REPLACE strategy, for converting peptide inhibitors into more drug-like non peptidic compounds, a PBD targeting compound series (""ABBAs""), has been identified and the key determinants of potency and selectivity elucidated through structure-activity relationship studies. In cellular experiments, the ABBAs were shown to lead to profound effects on the cell cycle, to inhibit tumor proliferation and overcome resistance of cells expressing the PLK1 C67V mutant to ATP-based inhibitors. These non-ATP competitive inhibitors of PLK1 were also used chemical biology probes to investigate the gene regulatory effects of PLK1, known to act on transcription factors such as p53.""","""['Sandra N Craig', 'Merissa Baxter', 'Danda Chapagai', 'Jessy M Stafford', 'Elmar Nurmemmedov', 'Diego Altomare', 'Michael D Wyatt', 'Campbell McInnes']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur J Med Chem""","""['Nonpeptidic, Polo-Box Domain-Targeted Inhibitors of PLK1 Block Kinase Activity, Induce Its Degradation and Target-Resistant Cells.', 'The natural product Aristolactam AIIIa as a new ligand targeting the polo-box domain of polo-like kinase 1 potently inhibits cancer cell proliferation.', 'Design and synthesis of a cell-permeable, drug-like small molecule inhibitor targeting the polo-box domain of polo-like kinase 1.', 'Plk1-targeted small molecule inhibitors: molecular basis for their potency and specificity.', 'Inhibitors of the Polo-Box Domain of Polo-Like Kinase 1.', 'Present and Future Perspective on PLK1 Inhibition in Cancer Treatment.']"""

However, data about the biological effects of ND in physiological conditions are scarce. In this study, we observed that prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) and breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7) cultured with ND show morphological changes and altered gene and protein expression. In 2D we could detect only slight effects of ND on cell growth and apoptosis induction. Therefore, we applied different functionalized ND in a novel 3D cell culture model that reflects better tissue conditions compared to conventional 2D cell cultures. In 3D proliferation was reduced by all nanoparticles and benzoquinone functionalized ND induced cell death. As the used decellularized scaffold maintains the tissue architecture, we could also functionally investigate if nanoparticles induce cell migration into deeper layers and if they display markers of Mesenchymal Epithelial Transition (MET). We detected in more mesenchymal and invasive growing MDA-MB-231 cells less vimentin and increased levels of pan-cytokeratin expression after ND treatment, which indicates a MET induction. Our observations suggest that the presence of ND stimulates MET, with varying degrees of transition. The observation that ND do not support the opposite, EMT, is beneficial, since EMT is known to play a major role in tumor metastasis. However, a special focus should be placed on the characterization of biological effects to be able to guarantee the safety of ND in clinical use.""","""['Anup James Shirley', 'Sarah Schweeberg', 'Thilo Waag', 'Matthias Peindl', 'Gudrun Dandekar', 'Heike Walles', 'Franz Jakob', 'Anke Krueger', 'Regina Ebert']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Mater Chem B""","""['Epithelial requirement for in vitro proliferation and xenograft growth and metastasis of MDA-MB-468 human breast cancer cells: oncogenic rather than tumor-suppressive role of E-cadherin.', 'Evaluating the effect of secretome of human amniotic mesenchymal stromal cells on apoptosis induction and epithelial-mesenchymal transition inhibition in LNCaP prostate cancer cells based on 2D and 3D cell culture models.', 'Benzyl isothiocyanate inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cultured and xenografted human breast cancer cells.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal transition stimulates human cancer cells to extend microtubule-based invasive protrusions and suppresses cell growth in collagen gel.', 'The monoamine oxidase-A inhibitor clorgyline promotes a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line.']"""

Herein, a photothermal bar-chart microfluidic immunosensing chip, with the integration of the conventional 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)-probed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-like system, was developed based on exploiting the photothermal pumping technique for visual bar-chart microfluidic immunosensing. Both the sandwich ELISA-like system and the photothermal pumping protocol were integrated into a single photothermal bar-chart chip. On-chip immunocaptured iron oxide nanoparticles catalyzed the oxidation of the chromogenic substrate, TMB, to produce a sensitive photothermal and chromogenic dual-functional probe, oxidized TMB. As the result of heat generation and the subsequent production of elevating vapor pressure in the sealed microfluidic environment, the on-chip near-infrared laser-driven photothermal effect of the probe served as a dose-dependent pumping force to drive the multiplexed quantitative display of the immunosensing signals as visual dye bar charts. Prostate-specific antigen as a model analyte was tested at a limit of detection of 1.9 ng·mL-1, lower than the clinical diagnostic threshold of prostate cancer.

However, a clear superiority of the optimal approach for software-based MRI processing during biopsy procedures is still unanswered. To investigate the impact of robotic approach and software-based image processing (rigid vs. elastic) during MRI/transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) fusion prostate biopsy (FBx) on overall and clinically significant (cs) PCa detection.  Methods:   The study relied on the instructional retrospective biopsy data collected data between September 2013 and August 2017. Overall, 241 men with at least one suspicious lesion (PI-RADS ≥ 3) on multiparametric MRI underwent FBx. The study protocol contains a systematic 12-core sextant biopsy plus 2 cores per targeted lesion. One experienced urologist performed 1048 targeted biopsy cores; 467 (45%) cores were obtained using rigid processing, while the remaining 581 (55%) cores relied on elastic image processing. CsPCa was defined as International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade ≥ 2. The effect of rigid versus elastic FBx on overall and csPCa detection rates was determined. Propensity score weighting and multivariable regression models were used to account for potential biases inherent to the retrospective study design.  Results:   In multivariable regression analyses, age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and PIRADS ≥ 3 lesion were related to higher odds of finding csPCa. Elastic software-based image processing was independently associated with a higher overall PCa (odds ratio [OR] = 3.6 [2.2-6.1], p < 0.001) and csPCa (OR = 4.8 [2.6-8.8], p < 0.001) detection, respectively.

Methods:   Based on the planning and daily pre and postfraction MRIs of 12 PC patients, bladder surface models (SMs) were generated on manually delineated contours and regionally aligned via surface-based registration. Subsequently, bladder surface dose models (SDMs) were created using face-wise dose sampling. To determine the bladder intrafractional and interfractional motion and dose variation, we performed a pose analysis between pre and postfraction bladder SMs, as well as surface mapping for fractional SMs. Discrepancies between the received dose, accumulated from daily SDMs, and the planned dose were then assessed on the corresponding SDMs. Complementary to the surface dose mapping, dose surface histogram (DSH)-based comparisons were also performed.  Results:   The intrafraction pose analysis revealed a significant (p < 0.05) bladder expansion, as well as an anterior/superior drift during the treatment. The intrafraction motion substantially altered dose to mid-bladder body, but not the bladder surface areas distal to or contiguous with the target. A similar pattern of dose variations was also detected by interfraction comparisons. With surface registration to the common SM, the cumulative bladder dose significantly differs from the planned dose. The discrepancy is evident in the mid-posterior range that corresponds to a mid- to high-dose region. The received DSH significantly differs from the planned DSH after permutation correction (p = 0.0122), while the overall surface-based comparison after multiple comparison correction is nonsignificant (p = 0.0800).  Conclusions:   We developed a novel surface-based intra and interdose mapping framework applied to a unique daily MR dataset for image-guided radiotherapy. The framework identified significant intrafraction bladder positional changes, localized the intra and interfraction variations, and quantified planned versus received dose differences on the bladder surface.

Methods:   NCCN suggests using actuarial life tables and relying on surgeon assessment of patient health to increase (for the best quartile) or decrease (for the worst quartile) LE by 50%. Eleven urologic surgeons allocated quartile of health and recommended treatments for ten patient vignettes.

Results:   Surgeon assessment agreed with the presumed true quartile of health based on a validated model in 41% of cases. For no case did three-quarters of surgeons assign health quartile correctly; in half of cases, <50% of surgeons assigned the correct quartile. The NCCN comorbidity-adjusted LE estimates underestimated risk of death in the best health quartile and overestimated risk of death in the worst health quartile, compared to the Kent model.

However, its clinical application remains limited by interobserver variability in grading and quantification, which has negative consequences for risk assessment and clinical management of prostate cancer.  Objective:   To examine the impact of an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted approach to prostate cancer grading and quantification.  Design, setting, and participants:   This diagnostic study was conducted at the University of Wisconsin-Madison from August 2, 2017, to December 30, 2019. The study chronologically selected 589 men with biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer who received care in the University of Wisconsin Health System between January 1, 2005, and February 28, 2017. A total of 1000 biopsy slides (1 or 2 slides per patient) were selected and scanned to create digital whole-slide images, which were used to develop and validate a deep convolutional neural network-based AI-powered platform. The whole-slide images were divided into a training set (n = 838) and validation set (n = 162). Three experienced academic urological pathologists (W.H., K.A.I., and R.H., hereinafter referred to as pathologists 1, 2, and 3, respectively) were involved in the validation. Data were collected between December 29, 2018, and December 20, 2019, and analyzed from January 4, 2020, to March 1, 2021.  Main outcomes and measures:   Accuracy of prostate cancer detection by the AI-powered platform and comparison of prostate cancer grading and quantification performed by the 3 pathologists using manual vs AI-assisted methods.  Results:   Among 589 men with biopsy slides, the mean (SD) age was 63.8 (8.2) years, the mean (SD) prebiopsy prostate-specific antigen level was 10.2 (16.2) ng/mL, and the mean (SD) total cancer volume was 15.4% (20.1%). The AI system was able to distinguish prostate cancer from benign prostatic epithelium and stroma with high accuracy at the patch-pixel level, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.88-0.95). The AI system achieved almost perfect agreement with the training pathologist (pathologist 1) in detecting prostate cancer at the patch-pixel level (weighted κ = 0.97; asymptotic 95% CI, 0.96-0.98) and in grading prostate cancer at the slide level (weighted κ = 0.98; asymptotic 95% CI, 0.96-1.00). Use of the AI-assisted method was associated with significant improvements in the concordance of prostate cancer grading and quantification between the 3 pathologists (eg, pathologists 1 and 2: 90.1% agreement using AI-assisted method vs 84.0% agreement using manual method; P < .001) and significantly higher weighted κ values for all pathologists (eg, pathologists 2 and 3: weighted κ = 0.92 [asymptotic 95% CI, 0.90-0.94] for AI-assisted method vs 0.76 [asymptotic 95% CI, 0.71-0.80] for manual method; P < .001) compared with the manual method.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this diagnostic study, an AI-powered platform was able to detect, grade, and quantify prostate cancer with high accuracy and efficiency and was associated with significant reductions in interobserver variability. These results suggest that an AI-powered platform could potentially transform histopathological evaluation and improve risk stratification and clinical management of prostate cancer.""","""['Wei Huang', 'Ramandeep Randhawa', 'Parag Jain', 'Kenneth A Iczkowski', 'Rong Hu', 'Samuel Hubbard', 'Jens Eickhoff', 'Hirak Basu', 'Rajat Roy']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Artificial intelligence for diagnosis and grading of prostate cancer in biopsies: a population-based, diagnostic study.', 'An artificial intelligence algorithm for prostate cancer diagnosis in whole slide images of core needle biopsies: a blinded clinical validation and deployment study.', 'Evaluation of the Use of Combined Artificial Intelligence and Pathologist Assessment to Review and Grade Prostate Biopsies.', 'Artificial Intelligence for Diagnosis and Gleason Grading of Prostate Cancer in Biopsies-Current Status and Next Steps.', 'A systematic review and meta-analysis of artificial intelligence diagnostic accuracy in prostate cancer histology identification and grading.', 'Inference of core needle biopsy whole slide images requiring definitive therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Artificial intelligence-based prediction for cancer-related outcomes in Africa: Status and potential refinements.', 'The promising role of new molecular biomarkers in prostate cancer: from coding and non-coding genes to artificial intelligence approaches.', 'The potential of artificial intelligence-based applications in kidney pathology.']"""

The annotated areas were categorized as follows: stroma, normal glands, and Gleason patterns 3, 4, and 5. Two analyses were performed: i) a categorical image classification method that labels each image as benign or as Gleason 3, Gleason 4, or Gleason 5, and ii) a scanning method in which distinct areas representative of benign and different Gleason patterns are delineated and labeled separately by a pathologist. The Inception v3 Convolutional Neural Network architecture was used in categorical model training, and a Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network was used to train the scanning method. After training, we selected three new whole-slide images that were not used during the training to evaluate the model as our test dataset. The analysis results of the images using deep learning algorithms were compared with those obtained by the pathologists.  Results:   In the categorical classification method, the trained model obtained a validation accuracy of 94.1% during training; however, the concordance with our expert uropathologists in the test dataset was only 44%. With the image-scanning method, our model demonstrated a validation accuracy of 91.2%. When the test images were used, the concordance between the deep learning method and uropathologists was 89%.

Methods:   The expression pattern and prognostic value of MYL9 were analyzed across multiple public datasets in different cancer. The correlations between MYL9 expression and immune infiltration among multiple cancers were analyzed by using the TIMER2.0. The MYL9-related gene enrichment analysis was implemented by mainly using KEGG and GO datasets.  Results:   MYL9 was lowly expressed in most cancers, such as breast cancer, lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, and stomach adenocarcinoma; but it was highly expressed in several cancers, such as cholangiocarcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and liver hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore, MYL9 expression was distinctively associated with prognosis in adrenocortical carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, brain glioma, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, blood cancer, and prostate cancer patients. The expressions of MYL9 were significantly associated with the infiltration of cancer-associated fibroblasts, B cell, CD8+ T cell, CD4+ T cell, macrophage, neutrophil, dendritic cell in different tumors as well as immune markers. In addition, we found that the functional mechanisms of MYL9 involved muscle contraction and focal adhesion.

Hence, dual inhibition of these proteins appears to be an auspicious approach for CRPC therapy. WNY0824 has been reported to exhibit nanomolar range inhibition as well as significant anti-proliferative activity on AR-positive CRPC cells in vitro. However, structural, and mechanistic events associated with its dual inhibitory and anti-proliferative mechanisms remain unclear. Utilizing integrative computer-assisted atomistic techniques, analyses revealed that the dual-inhibitory activity of WNY0824 against BRD4 and PLK1 proteins is mediated by conserved residues present in the binding cavities of both proteins which are shown to elicit various strong intermolecular interactions and thus favour binding affinity. Also, binding orientation of the ligand at the protein binding cavities allowed for important hydrophobic interactions which resulted in high binding free energy of -42.50 kcal/mol and -51.64 kcal/mol towards BRD4 and PLK1, respectively. While van der Waals interactions are very important to ligand binding in BRD4-WNY complex, electrostatic interactions are pertinent to PLK1-WNY complex. Intriguingly, WNY0824 triggered conformational alterations in both proteins through increased structural instability, decreased structural compactness and mitigation in exposure of residues to solvent surface area. Consequently, critical interactions peculiar to the oncogenic activities of BRD4 and PLK1 were inhibited, a phenomenon that results in an antagonism of CRPC progression. The mechanistic insights presented in this report would further assist in the structure-based design of improved inhibitors useful in CRPC therapy.""","""['Oluwole B Akawa', 'Temitayo I Subair', 'Kehinde F Omolabi', 'Felix O Okunlola', 'Mahmoud E S Soliman']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Chem Biodivers""","""['Novel Dual BET and PLK1 Inhibitor WNY0824 Exerts Potent Antitumor Effects in CRPC by Inhibiting Transcription Factor Function and Inducing Mitotic Abnormality.', 'Identification of a selective BRD4 PROTAC with potent antiproliferative effects in AR-positive prostate cancer based on a dual BET/PLK1 inhibitor.', 'Plk1 Inhibition Enhances the Efficacy of BET Epigenetic Reader Blockade in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Inhibitors of the Polo-Box Domain of Polo-Like Kinase 1.', 'Developments of polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) inhibitors as anti-cancer agents.']"""

Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) are the most common subtypes of NSCLC. Despite genetic differences between LUAD and LUSC have been clarified in depth, the metabolic differences of these two subtypes are still unclear.  Methods:   Totally, 128 plasma samples of NSCLC patients were collected before initial treatments, followed by determination of LC-ESI-Q TRAP-MS/MS. Differentially expressed metabolites were screened based on a strict standard.  Results:   Based on the integrated platform of targeted metabolome and lipidome, a total of 1141 endogenous metabolites (including 809 lipids) were finally detected in the plasma of NSCLC patients, including 16 increased and 3 decreased endogenous compounds in LUAD group when compared with LUSC group. Thereafter, a logistic regression model integrating four differential metabolites [2-(Methylthio) ethanol, Cortisol, D-Glyceric Acid, and N-Acetylhistamine] was established and could accurately differentiate LUAD and LUSC with an area under the ROC curve of 0.946 (95% CI 0.886-1.000). The cut-off value showed a satisfactory efficacy with 92.0% sensitivity and 92.9% specificity. KEGG functional enrichment analysis showed these differentially expressed metabolites could be further enriched in riboflavin metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, prostate cancer, etc. The endogenous metabolites identified in this study have the potential to be used as novel biomarkers to distinguish LUAD from LUSC.  Conclusions:   Our research might provide more evidence for exploring the pathogenesis and differentiation of NSCLC. This research could promote a deeper understanding and precise treatment of lung cancer.""","""['Peng Cao#', 'Sanlan Wu#', 'Wei Guo', 'Qilin Zhang', 'Weijing Gong', 'Qiang Li', 'Rui Zhang', 'Xiaorong Dong', 'Shuangbing Xu', 'Yani Liu', 'Shaojun Shi', 'Yifei Huang', 'Yu Zhang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Metabolomics""","""['Exploring and comparing of the gene expression and methylation differences between lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Identification of differentially expressed genes between lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma using transcriber signature analysis.', 'GPC3 affects the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma.', 'The Effect of GLUT1 on the Survival Rate and Immune Cell Infiltration of Lung Adenocarcinoma and Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Meta and Bioinformatics Analysis.', 'Translational Metabolomics of Head Injury: Exploring Dysfunctional Cerebral Metabolism with Ex Vivo NMR Spectroscopy-Based Metabolite Quantification.', 'Targeted metabolomic profiling as a tool for diagnostics of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.', 'Small molecule metabolites: discovery of biomarkers and therapeutic targets.', 'Luteolin alleviates methionine-choline-deficient diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis by modulating host serum metabolome and gut microbiome.', 'Improved profiling of low molecular weight serum proteome for gastric carcinoma by data-independent acquisition.']"""

Dietary information was collected with a food frequency questionnaire. A dietary diabetes risk-reduction score was calculated to reflect adherence to this dietary pattern, with higher scores representing better adherence.

The androgen receptor (AR) antagonist enzalutamide is an FDA-approved drug for treatment of patients with late-stage prostate cancer and is currently under clinical study for early-stage prostate cancer treatment. After a short positive response period to enzalutamide, tumors will develop drug resistance. In this study, we uncovered that DNA methylation was deregulated in enzalutamide-resistant cells. DNMT activity and DNMT3B expression were upregulated in resistant cell lines. Enzalutamide induced the expression of DNMT3A and DNMT3B in prostate cancer cells with a potential role of p53 and pRB in this process. The overexpression of DNMT3B3, a DNMT3B variant, promoted an enzalutamide-resistant phenotype in C4-2B cell lines. Inhibition of DNA methylation and DNMT3B knockdown induced a resensitization to enzalutamide. Decitabine treatment in enzalutamide-resistant cells induced a decrease of the expression of AR-V7 and changes of genes for apoptosis, DNA repair, and mRNA splicing. Combination treatment of decitabine and enzalutamide induced a decrease of tumor weight, Ki-67 and AR-V7 expression and an increase of cleaved-caspase3 levels in 22Rv1 xenografts. The collective results suggest that DNA methylation pathway is deregulated after enzalutamide resistance onset and that targeting DNA methyltransferases restores the sensitivity to enzalutamide in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Elia Farah#', 'Zhuangzhuang Zhang#', 'Sagar M Utturkar', 'Jinpeng Liu', 'Timothy L Ratliff', 'Xiaoqi Liu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Identification of Genes Required for Enzalutamide Resistance in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells In Vitro.', 'Combination therapy with androgen receptor N-terminal domain antagonist EPI-7170 and enzalutamide yields synergistic activity in AR-V7-positive prostate cancer.', 'Loss of Long Noncoding RNA NXTAR in Prostate Cancer Augments Androgen Receptor Expression and Enzalutamide Resistance.', 'Mechanisms of enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer and therapeutic strategies to overcome it.', 'Second-Generation Androgen Receptor Antagonists as Hormonal Therapeutics for Three Forms of Prostate Cancer.', 'A GATA2-CDC6 axis modulates androgen receptor blockade-induced senescence in prostate cancer.', 'Consistent DNA Hypomethylations in Prostate Cancer.', 'Potential of the miR-200 Family as a Target for Developing Anti-Cancer Therapeutics.']"""

Cholesterol-lowering interventions are employed widely and safely to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease and has been proposed for chemoprevention. Using preclinical models and a window-of-opportunity clinical trial, we describe an adaptive antitumor immunity resulting from cholesterol lowering.  Experimental design:   Statins do not reliably lower serum cholesterol in mice. Therefore, oral ezetimibe was administered to mice to lower serum cholesterol to clinically relevant levels and evaluated the final adaptive immune response. T-lymphocytes-specific mTORC2 knockout mice were used to evaluate mTOR signaling and antitumor immunity. Pretreatment and posttreatment prostate tumors and lymphocytes were examined from a window-of-opportunity clinical trial where men with prostate cancer were treated with 2 to 6 weeks of aggressive cholesterol-lowering intervention prior to radical prostatectomy.  Results:   Mice treated with oral ezetimibe exhibited enhanced antitumor immunity against syngeneic cancers in a CD8+ lymphocyte-dependent manner, produced immunity that was transferrable through lymphocytes, and had enhanced central CD8+ T-cell memory. In mice and in patients undergoing prostatectomy, lowering serum cholesterol inhibited mTORC2 signaling in lymphocytes and increased infiltration of CD8+ lymphocytes into prostate tumors. T-lymphocyte-specific mTORC2 knockout mice demonstrated enhanced CD8+ lymphocyte function and antitumor capacity. In patients, cholesterol-lowering intervention prior to prostatectomy decreased the proliferation of normal prostate and low-grade adenocarcinomas.  Conclusions:   Lowering serum cholesterol decreased signaling through mTORC2 and enhanced antitumor CD8+ T-cell memory. We provide a rationale for large-scale clinical testing of cholesterol lowering strategies for prostate cancer chemoprevention.""","""['Yanping Wang', 'Sungyong You', 'Shengchen Su', 'Austin Yeon', 'Eric M Lo', 'Sungjin Kim', 'James L Mohler', 'Michael R Freeman', 'Hyung L Kim']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['mTOR Complex Signaling through the SEMA4A-Plexin B2 Axis Is Required for Optimal Activation and Differentiation of CD8+ T Cells.', 'mTORC1 and mTORC2 selectively regulate CD8⁺ T cell differentiation.', 'Amino acids and RagD potentiate mTORC1 activation in CD8+ T cells to confer antitumor immunity.', 'mTOR Signaling pathway as a master regulator of memory CD8+ T-cells, Th17, and NK cells development and their functional properties.', 'Targeted Inhibition of Rictor/mTORC2 in Cancer Treatment: A New Era after Rapamycin.', 'The role of cholesterol metabolism in tumor therapy, from bench to bed.', 'Targeting Mutant p53 for Cancer Treatment: Moving Closer to Clinical Use?', ""Role of Lipids and Lipid Metabolism in Prostate Cancer Progression and the Tumor's Immune Environment."", 'Ezetimibe and Cancer: Is There a Connection?', 'Deregulation of Cholesterol Homeostasis by a Nuclear Hormone Receptor Crosstalk in Advanced Prostate Cancer.']"""

Multiparametric MRI/ultrasound (mpMRI/US) fusion has recognized advantages for the performance of prostate biopsy, however, it encompasses additional cost, time and technical expertise to performing prostate biopsy in comparison to conventional trans-rectal ultrasound biopsy. MicroUS may simplify and optimize this pathway.  Methods:   OPTIMUM is a 3-arm randomized controlled trial comparing microUS guided biopsy with MRI/US fusion and MRI/MicroUS ""contour-less"" fusion. This trial will investigate whether microUS alone, or in combination with mpMRI, provides effective guidance during prostate biopsy for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) for biopsy naïve subjects. 1200 subjects will be randomized. The economic impact will be evaluated.  Results:   The rate of csPCa (defined as Grade Group 2 and above) in each arm will be compared. The primary hypothesis is non-inferiority of csPCa rate between the MRI/US fusion arm and the microUS-only arm (including the blinded microUS-only portion of the MRI/MicroUS arm). As a secondary objective, the csPCa rate between MRI/MicroUS fusion and MRI/US fusion arms will also be compared. Other secondary objectives include the increase in rate of patients diagnosed with csPCa due to each type of sample (mpMRI targeted, microUS targeted, systematic), the negative predictive value of each imaging modality, and a health economic analysis of the procedures in each arm.  Conclusions:   OPTIMUM will determine whether microUS can be used as an alternative to MRI/US fusion biopsy. The trial will also evaluate the efficacy of the simplified ""contour-less"" MRI/MicroUS fusion procedure.

We report the association of baseline HR-QoL metrics with overall survival and toxicity in localised prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   This was a secondary analysis of a phase III randomised controlled study conducted in a single-payer health system. Patients with Gleason score ≤7, clinical stage T1b-T3a and prostate-specific antigen <30 ng/ml were randomised to neoadjuvant and concurrent androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for 6 months starting 4 months before prostate radiotherapy or concurrent and adjuvant ADT for 6 months starting simultaneously with prostate radiotherapy. HR-QoL scores were estimated using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL questionnaire. A multistate Markov model was used to determine the association of baseline HR-QoL metrics with overall survival and a multilevel multivariable Cox regression was used to determine the association with the incidence of delayed-onset grade ≥3 radiotherapy-related toxicities. To adjust for multiple analyses, P < 0.025 was considered as statistically significant.  Results:   Overall, 393 patients with baseline HR-QoL data were included in this analysis: 194 in the neoadjuvant arm and 199 in the adjuvant arm.

The metabolic rewiring, epigenetic reprogramming, and chemopreventive effect of UA in prostate cancer (PCa) remain unknown. Herein, we investigated the efficacy of UA in PCa xenograft, and its biological effects on cellular metabolism, DNA methylation, and transcriptomic using multi-omics approaches. The metabolomics was quantified by liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) while epigenomic CpG methylation in parallel with transcriptomic gene expression was studied by next-generation sequencing technologies. UA administration attenuated the growth of transplanted human VCaP-Luc cells in immunodeficient mice. UA regulated several cellular metabolites and metabolism-related signaling pathways including S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), methionine, glucose 6-phosphate, CDP-choline, phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis, glycolysis, and nucleotide sugars metabolism. RNA-seq analyses revealed UA regulated several signaling pathways, including CXCR4 signaling, cancer metastasis signaling, and NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response.

Five differently-sized spherical hydroxyapatites mimicking prostatic calcification (pseudo-calcification) were arranged in the order of their sizes at the center of a plastic container filled with gelatin. This calcification phantom underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, including the multiple spoiled gradient-echo sequences (SPGR) for the QSM and CT as a reference. The volume of each pseudo-calcification and center-to-center distance between the pseudo-calcifications delineated by QSM and CT were measured. In the human study, eight patients with prostate cancer who underwent radiation therapy and had some prostatic calcifications were included. The patients underwent CT and SPGR and modified DIXON sequence for MR-only simulation. The hybrid QSM processing combined with the complex signals in the SPGR and water and fat fraction maps estimated from the modified DIXON sequence were used to reconstruct the pelvic susceptibility map in humans. The threshold of CT numbers was set at 130 HU, while the QSM images were manually segmented in the calcification phantom and human studies. In the phantom study, there was an excellent agreement in the pseudo-calcification volumes between QSM and CT (y = 1.02x - 7.38, R2 = 0.99). The signal profiles had similar trends in CT and QSM. The center-to-center distances between the pseudo-calcifications in the phantom were also identical in QSM and CT. The calcification volumes were almost identical between the QSM and CT in the human study (y = 0.95x - 9.32, R2 = 1.00). QSM can offer geometric and volumetric accuracies to delineate prostatic calcifications, similar to CT. The prostatic calcification delineated by QSM may facilitate image-guided radiotherapy in the MR-only simulation workflow.""","""['Hirohito Kan', 'Takahiro Tsuchiya', 'Masato Yamada', 'Hiroshi Kunitomo', 'Harumasa Kasai', 'Yuta Shibamoto']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Potential applications of the quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) in MR-guided radiation therapy.', 'Potential of quantitative susceptibility mapping for detection of prostatic calcifications.', 'Geometric discrepancy of image-guided radiation therapy in patients with prostate cancer without implanted fiducial markers using a commercial pseudo-CT generation method.', 'Aspects of MR image distortions in radiotherapy treatment planning.', 'QSM Throughout the Body.']"""

Methods:   A retrospective cohort study was conducted, using the Veterans Health Administration claims database (April 2013-March 2018). Among 369,734 prostate cancer patients, we selected all men who developed metastases within 90 days before or after medical/surgical castration and who received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Patients were categorized into four cohorts: ADT-only (± <90-day nonsteroidal anti-androgen [NSAA] use), ADT + NSAA, ADT + docetaxel, and ADT + abiraterone. Main outcomes were treatment patterns, time-to-progression to metastatic castration-resistant disease, and overall survival. Multivariable analysis and sensitivity analysis were conducted.  Results:   Of 1395 patients, 874 (63%) received ADT-only, 338 (24%) received ADT + NSAA, 108 (8%) received ADT + docetaxel, and 75 (5%) received ADT + abiraterone. Proportions on ADT-only and ADT + NSAA declined (from 66% to 60% and from 31% to 17%, respectively) over the study period, while proportions prescribed ADT + docetaxel or abiraterone increased from 3% to 9% and from 1% to 15%, respectively. Patients treated with ADT + NSAA had similar risks of castration-resistant disease (hazard ratio [HR] 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.87, 1.26) and overall mortality (HR 1.22; 95% CI: 0.97, 1.54) as ADT-only.  Conclusions:   Most patients with mCSPC initiating ADT received ADT-only or ADT + NSAA, despite the emergence of docetaxel and novel hormonal therapies. Even in the most recent period (2017 to early 2018), only 24% of men received intensified therapy with agents known to prolong survival versus ADT-only.

[18F]DCFPyL positron emission tomography combined with MRI (PSMA-PET/MRI) might be of additional value to localize primary PCa. The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic performance of [18F]DCFPyL-PET/MRI vs. mpMRI in tumour localization based on histopathology after robot-assisted radical-prostatectomy (RARP), also assessing biopsy advice for potential image-guided prostate biopsies.  Methods:   Thirty prospectively included patients with intermediate to high-risk PCa underwent [18F]DCFPyL-PET/MRI and mpMRI prior to RARP. Two nuclear medicine physicians and two radiologists assessed tumour localization on [18F]DCFPyL-PET/MRI and on mpMRI respectively, and gave a prostate biopsy advice (2 segments) using a 14-segment model of the prostate. The uro-pathologist evaluated the RARP specimen for clinically significant PCa (csPCa) using the same model. csPCa was defined as any PCa with Grade Group (GG) ≥ 2. The biopsy advice based on imaging was correlated with the final histology in the RARP specimen for a total-agreement analysis. An additional near-agreement correlation was performed to approximate clinical reality.  Results:   Overall, 142 of 420 (33.8%) segments contained csPCa after pathologic examination. The segments recommended for targeted biopsy contained the highest GG PCa segment in 27/30 patients (90.0%) both for [18F]DCFPyL-PET/MRI and mpMRI. Areas under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for the total-agreement detection of csPCa per segment using [18F]DCFPyL-PET/MRI were 0.70, 50.0%, 89.9%, 71.7%, and 77.9%, respectively. These results were 0.75, 54.2%, 94.2%, 82.8%, and 80.1%, respectively, for mpMRI only.  Conclusion:   Both [18F]DCFPyL-PET/MRI and mpMRI were only partly able to detect csPCa on a per-segment basis. An accurate detection (90.0%) of the highest GG lesion at patient-level was observed when comparing both [18F]DCFPyL-PET/MRI and mpMRI biopsy advice with the histopathology in the RARP specimen.

[68 Ga]PSMA-11 PET/MRI-guided biopsy showed promising results but also persisting limitation of sampling error, due to impaired image fusion. We aimed to assess the possibility of intraoperative quantification of [18F]PSMA-1007 PET/CT uptake in core biopsies as an instant confirmation for accurate lesion sampling.  Methods:   In this IRB-approved, prospective, proof-of-concept study, we included five consecutive patients with suspected PCa. All underwent [18F]PSMA-1007 PET/CT scans followed by immediate PET/CT-guided and saturation template biopsy (3.1 ± 0.3 h after PET). The activity in biopsy cores was measured as counts per minute (cpm) in a gamma spectrometer. Pearson's test was used to correlate counts with histopathology (WHO/ISUP), tumor length, and membranous PSMA expression on immunohistochemistry (IHC).  Results:   In 43 of 113 needles, PCa was present. The mean cpm was overall significantly higher in needles with PCa (263 ± 396 cpm) compared to needles without PCa (73 ± 44 cpm, p < 0.001). In one patient with moderate PSMA uptake (SUVmax 8.7), 13 out of 24 needles had increased counts (100-200 cpm) but only signs of inflammation and PSMA expression in benign glands on IHC. Excluding this case, ROC analysis resulted in an AUC of 0.81, with an optimal cut-off to confirm PCa at 75 cpm (sens/spec of 65.1%/87%). In all 4 patients with PCa, the first or second PSMA PET-guided needle was positive for sigPCa with high counts (156-2079 cpm).  Conclusions:   [18F]PSMA-1007 uptake in PCa can be used to confirm accurate lesion sampling of the dominant tumor intraoperatively.

Early molecular imaging response based on total viable tumor burden and its association with overall survival (OS) was explored in this study.  Methods:   Sixty-six mCRPC patients who received [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 RLT within a prospective patient registry (REALITY Study, NCT04833517) were analyzed. Patients received a [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan before the first and after the second cycle of PSMA-RLT. Total lesion PSMA (TLP) was determined by semiautomatic whole-body tumor segmentation. Molecular imaging response was assessed by change in TLP and modified PERCIST criteria. Biochemical response was assessed using standard serum PSA and PCWG3 criteria. Both response assessment methods and additional baseline parameters were analyzed regarding their association with OS by univariate and multivariable analysis.  Results:   By molecular imaging, 40/66 (60.6%) patients showed partial remission (PR), 19/66 (28.7%) stable disease (SD), and 7/66 (10.6%) progressive disease (PD). Biochemical response assessment revealed PR in 34/66 (51.5%) patients, SD in 20/66 (30.3%), and PD in 12/66 (18.2%). Response assessments were concordant in 49/66 (74.3%) cases. On univariate analysis, both molecular and biochemical response (p = 0.001 and 0.008, respectively) as well as two baseline characteristics (ALP and ECOG) were each significantly associated with OS. The median OS of patients showing molecular PR was 24.6 versus 10.7 months in the remaining patients (with SD or PD). On multivariable analysis molecular imaging response remained an independent predictor of OS (p = 0.002), eliminating biochemical response as insignificant (p = 0.515).  Conclusion:   The new whole-body molecular imaging-derived biomarker, early change of total lesion PSMA (TLP), independently predicts overall survival in [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 RLT in mCRPC, outperforming conventional PSA-based response assessment.

Nonlinear microscopy (NLM) is a fluorescence microscopy technique that can produce high-resolution images of freshly excised tissue resembling formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) H&E. NLM enables evaluation of tissue up to ~100 µm below the surface, analogous to serial sectioning, but without requiring microtome sectioning. One hundred and seventy biopsies were collected from 63 patients who underwent in-bore MRI or MRI/ultrasound fusion biopsy procedures. Biopsies were stained in acridine orange and sulforhodamine 101, a nuclear and cytoplasmic/stromal fluorescent dye, for 45 s. Genitourinary pathologists evaluated the biopsies using NLM by translating the biopsies in real time to areas of interest and NLM images were recorded. After NLM evaluation, the biopsies were processed for standard FFPE H&E and similarities and differences between NLM and FFPE H&E were investigated. Accuracies of NLM diagnoses and Gleason scores were calculated using FFPE histology as the gold standard. Pathologists achieved a 92.4% sensitivity (85.0-96.9%, 95% confidence intervals) and 100.0% specificity (94.3-100.0%) for detecting carcinoma compared to FFPE histology. The agreement between the Grade Group determined by NLM versus FFPE histology had an unweighted Cohen's Kappa of 0.588. The average NLM evaluation time was 2.10 min per biopsy (3.08 min for the first 20 patients, decreasing to 1.54 min in subsequent patients). Further studies with larger patient populations, larger number of pathologists, and multiple institutions are warranted.

Although exosomes can package lncRNAs to mediate extracellular communication, the role of exosomal lncRNA AY927529 in prostate cancer (PCa) remains unclear. Exosomes were extracted from normal human prostatic epithelial cell lines (BPH-1 and RWPE-1) and PCa cell lines (VCaP and LNCaP, DU145, PC3) by ultrahigh speed centrifugation. Results of Western blot indicated that Alix, HSC70 and TSGl01 protein levels were upregulated in exosomes derived from PCa cells. LncAY927529 level was upregulated in PCa cells and exosomes derived from PCa patient serum and human PCa cells. CCK-8, Transwell and Flow cytometry assays demonstrated that bone marrow stromal cell line (ST2) conditioned medium (ST2-CM), treated with exosomes derived from PCa cells with high lncAY927529 level, promoted proliferation and invasion of PC3 and DU145 cells, and inhibited cell apoptosis. RT-qPCR assay indicated that lncAY927529 level was downregulated in PC3 and DU145 cells, exosomes derived from PCa cells (PCa-Exo) and ST2-CM treated with PCa-Exo with low expression of lncAY927529, and overexpression of lncAY927529 had the opposite results. In addition, Western blot assay showed that the autophagy related protein LC3II level was increased in ST2 cells treated with exosomes derived from DU145 cells with high expression of lncAY927529, and LC3I protein level was decreased. CXCL14 acted as a RNA-binding protein of lncAY927529, and exosome-mediated lncAY927529 positively regulated CXCL14 levels in ST2 cells. In general, exosome-mediated lncAY927529 could promote PCa cell proliferation and invasion by regulating bone microenvironment, suggesting that exosomal lncAY927529 may be a potential molecular diagnostic marker of PCa.""","""['Qi Li', 'Jinhao Hu', 'Yibo Shi', 'Mulun Xiao', 'Tianxiang Bi', 'Chaoliang Wang', 'Liang Yan', 'Xiaoyan Li']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cell Cycle""","""['The diagnostic role and mechanistic functions of exosomal lncRNAs in prostate cancer.', 'LncRNA nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 1 shuttled by prostate cancer cells-secreted exosomes initiates osteoblastic phenotypes in the bone metastatic microenvironment via miR-205-5p/runt-related transcription factor 2/splicing factor proline- and glutamine-rich/polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2 axis.', 'TUG1 promotes the development of prostate cancer by regulating RLIM.', 'Tumor-Derived Exosomal Long Noncoding RNAs as Promising Diagnostic Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer.', 'Exosomal noncoding RNAs in prostate cancer.', 'Tumor-derived extracellular vesicle nucleic acids as promising diagnostic biomarkers for prostate cancer.', 'Exosomes: Diagnostic and Therapeutic Implications in Cancer.', 'Targeting PI3K/Akt signaling in prostate cancer therapy.', 'The diagnostic role and mechanistic functions of exosomal lncRNAs in prostate cancer.', 'Roles of exosomes as drug delivery systems in cancer immunotherapy: a mini-review.']"""

It has the potential for intra-fraction motion tracking in radiation therapy. In this study, a deep learning-based method has been developed to tackle the challenges in motion tracking using US imaging.  Methods:   We present a Markov-like network, which is implemented via generative adversarial networks, to extract features from sequential US frames (one tracked frame followed by untracked frames) and thereby estimate a set of deformation vector fields (DVFs) through the registration of the tracked frame and the untracked frames. The positions of the landmarks in the untracked frames are finally determined by shifting landmarks in the tracked frame according to the estimated DVFs. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated on the testing dataset by calculating the tracking error (TE) between the predicted and ground truth landmarks on each frame.  Results:   The proposed method was evaluated using the MICCAI CLUST 2015 dataset which was collected using seven US scanners with eight types of transducers and the Cardiac Acquisitions for Multi-structure Ultrasound Segmentation (CAMUS) dataset which was acquired using GE Vivid E95 ultrasound scanners. The CLUST dataset contains 63 2D and 22 3D US image sequences respectively from 42 and 18 subjects, and the CAMUS dataset includes 2D US images from 450 patients. On CLUST dataset, our proposed method achieved a mean tracking error of 0.70 ± 0.38 mm for the 2D sequences and 1.71 ± 0.84 mm for the 3D sequences for those public available annotations. And on CAMUS dataset, a mean tracking error of 0.54 ± 1.24 mm for the landmarks in the left atrium was achieved.  Conclusions:   A novel motion tracking algorithm using US images based on modern deep learning techniques has been demonstrated in this study. The proposed method can offer millimeter-level tumor motion prediction in real time, which has the potential to be adopted into routine tumor motion management in radiation therapy.""","""['Xianjin Dai', 'Yang Lei', 'Justin Roper', 'Yue Chen', 'Jeffrey D Bradley', 'Walter J Curran', 'Tian Liu', 'Xiaofeng Yang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Landmark tracking in liver US images using cascade convolutional neural networks with long short-term memory.', 'Tracking 3D ultrasound anatomical landmarks via three orthogonal plane-based scale discriminative correlation filter network.', 'Attention-aware fully convolutional neural network with convolutional long short-term memory network for ultrasound-based motion tracking.', 'Advances in 4D medical imaging and 4D radiation therapy.', 'Automatic Segmentation of Multiple Organs on 3D CT Images by Using Deep Learning Approaches.', 'Robust and Realtime Large Deformation Ultrasound Registration Using End-to-End Differentiable Displacement Optimisation.', 'Landmark tracking in liver US images using cascade convolutional neural networks with long short-term memory.', 'Co-attention spatial transformer network for unsupervised motion tracking and cardiac strain analysis in 3D echocardiography.', 'Therapeutic Ultrasound Effects on Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Cardiomyocytes Measured Optically and with Spectral Ultrasound.']"""

Objective:   To evaluate the use of HRT vs CRT in men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer and compare patient-reported outcomes (PROs) at a population level.  Design, setting, and participants:   Registry-based cohort study from the Australian and New Zealand Prostate Cancer Outcomes Registry (PCOR-ANZ). Participants were men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer treated with primary RT (excluding brachytherapy) from January 2016 to December 2019. Data were analyzed in March 2021.  Exposures:   HRT defined as 2.5 to 3.3 Gy and CRT defined as 1.7 to 2.3 Gy per fraction.  Main outcomes and measures:   Temporal trends and institutional, clinicopathological, and sociodemographic factors associated with use of HRT were analyzed. PROs were assessed 12 months following RT using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC)-26 Short Form questionnaire. Differences in PROs were analyzed by adjusting for age and National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk category.  Results:   Of 8305 men identified as receiving primary RT, 6368 met the inclusion criteria for CRT (n = 4482) and HRT (n = 1886). The median age was 73.1 years (IQR, 68.2-77.3 years), 2.6% (168) had low risk, 45.7% (2911) had intermediate risk, 44.5% (2836) had high-/very high-risk, and 7.1% (453) had regional nodal disease. Use of HRT increased from 2.1% (9 of 435) in the first half of 2016 to 52.7% (539 of 1023) in the second half of 2019, with lower uptake in the high-/very high-risk (1.9% [4 of 215] to 42.4% [181 of 427]) compared with the intermediate-risk group (2.2% [4 of 185] to 67.6% [325 of 481]) (odds ratio, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.15-0.45). Substantial variability in the use of HRT for intermediate-risk disease remained at the institutional level (median 53.3%; range, 0%-100%) and clinician level (median 57.9%; range, 0%-100%) in the last 2 years of the study period. There were no clinically significant differences across EPIC-26 urinary and bowel functional domains or bother scores.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this cohort study, use of HRT for prostate cancer increased substantially from 2016. This population-level data demonstrated clinically equivalent PROs and supports the continued implementation of HRT into routine practice. The wide variation in practice observed at the jurisdictional, institutional, and clinician level provides stakeholders with information that may be useful in targeting implementation strategies and benchmarking services.""","""['David I Pryor', 'Jarad M Martin', 'Jeremy L Millar', 'Heather Day', 'Wee Loon Ong', 'Marketa Skala', 'Liesel M FitzGerald', 'Benjamin Hindson', 'Braden Higgs', ""Michael E O'Callaghan"", 'Farhan Syed', 'Amy J Hayden', 'Sandra L Turner', 'Nathan Papa']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Quality of Life in Patients With Low-Risk Prostate Cancer Treated With Hypofractionated vs Conventional Radiotherapy: A Phase 3 Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'Impact of Hypofractionated Radiotherapy on Patient-reported Outcomes in Prostate Cancer: Results up to 5\xa0yr in the CHHiP trial (CRUK/06/016).', 'Ultra-hypofractionated versus conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: 5-year outcomes of the HYPO-RT-PC randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial.', 'Conventional Versus Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy for Localized or Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis along with Therapeutic Implications.', 'Genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity among patients with localized prostate cancer treated with conventional versus moderately hypofractionated radiation therapy: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Does cost minimization of hypofractionated radiation therapy content all health stakeholders?', 'Improving Outcome-Driven Care in Multiple Myeloma Using Patient-Reported Outcomes: A Qualitative Evaluation Study.', 'Hyaluronic Acid Spacer for Hypofractionated Prostate Radiation Therapy: A Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'Real-world utilisation of brachytherapy boost and patient-reported functional outcomes in men who had external beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer in Australia.', 'Trends in Use of and Medicare Spending on Short-Course Radiotherapy for Lymphomas From 2015 to 2019.']"""

Methods:   Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations were employed to identify the properties of magnetic nanoparticles that deliver high Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) values. Optimal volumes were determined for anisotropies ranging between 11 and 40 kJ/m3 under clinically relevant magnetic field conditions. Atomistic spin simulations were employed to determine the aspect ratios of ellipsoidal magnetite nanoparticles that deliver the target properties. A numerical model was developed using the extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) phantom to simulate low-field (4 kA/m) and high-field (18 kA/m) prostate cancer thermotherapy. A stationary optimization study exploiting the Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA) was carried out to calculate the concentration fields that deliver homogenous temperature distributions within target thermotherapy range constrained by the optimization objective function. A time-dependent study was used to compute the thermal dose of a 30-min session.  Results:   Prolate ellipsoidal magnetite nanoparticles with a volume of 3922 ± 35 nm3 and aspect ratio of 1.56, which yields an effective anisotropy of 20 kJ/m3 , constituted the optimal design at current maximum clinical field properties (H0 = 18 kA/m, f = 100 kHz), with SAR = 342.0 ± 2.7 W/g, while nanoparticles with a volume of 4147 ± 36 nm3 , aspect ratio of 1.29, and effective anisotropy 11 kJ/m3 were optimal for low-field applications (H0 = 4 kA/m, f = 100 kHz), with SAR = 50.2 ± 0.5 W/g.

Radical prostatectomy (RP) is one such procedure that has seen multiple advances over the past decade. The objective of this study was to leverage RP as an index case to determine whether practice changes over time produced observable improvements in patient-reported outcomes.  Methods:   This study analyzed patients undergoing RP by experienced surgeons at a tertiary care center with prospectively maintained patient-reported outcome data from 2008 to 2019. Four patient-reported urinary function outcomes at 6 and 12 months after RP were defined with a validated instrument: good urinary function (domain score ≥ 17), no incontinence (0 pads per day), social continence (≤1 pad per day), and severe incontinence (≥3 pads per day). Multivariable logistic regressions evaluated changes in outcomes based on the surgical date.  Results:   Among 3945 patients meeting the inclusion criteria, excellent urinary outcomes were reported throughout the decade but without consistent observable improvements over time. Specifically, there were no improvements in good urinary function at 12 months (P = .087) based on the surgical date, and there were countervailing effects on no incontinence (worsening; P = .005) versus severe incontinence (improving; P = .003). Neither approach (open, laparoscopic, or robotic), nor nerve sparing, nor membranous urethral length mediated changes in outcomes.  Conclusions:   In a decade with multiple advances in surgical and postoperative care, there was evidence of improvements in severe incontinence, but no measurable improvements across 3 other urinary outcomes. Although worsening disease factors could contribute to the stable observed outcomes, a more systematic approach to evaluating techniques and implementing patient selection and postoperative care advances is needed.  Lay summary:   Although there have been advances in radical prostatectomy over the past decade, consistent observable improvements in postoperative incontinence were not reported by patients. To improve urinary function outcomes beyond the current high standard, the approach to studying innovations in surgical technique needs to be changed, and further development of other aspects of prostatectomy care is needed.""","""['Matthew B Clements', 'Caroline C Gmelich', 'Emily A Vertosick', 'Jim C Hu', 'Jaspreet S Sandhu', 'Peter T Scardino', 'James A Eastham', 'Vincent P Laudone', 'Karim A Touijer', 'Jonathan A Coleman', 'Andrew J Vickers', 'Behfar Ehdaie']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Retzius-sparing Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Leads to Durable Improvement in Urinary Function and Quality of Life Versus Standard Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Without Compromise on Oncologic Efficacy: Single-surgeon Series and Step-by-step Guide.', 'Degree of preservation of the neurovascular bundles during radical prostatectomy and urinary continence 1 year after surgery.', 'Long-term oncological and continence outcomes after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a single-centre experience.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Critical comparative analysis between open, laparoscopic and robotic radical prostatectomy: urinary continence and sexual function (part II).']"""

Procedures:   Ten consecutive patients with biopsy-proven high-risk prostate cancer underwent a dynamic 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scan of the pelvis for the first 45 min post-injection (p.i.) followed by a static PET/CT at 2 h p.i. 18F-DCFPyL uptake values and kinetics were compared between benign prostate tissue and prostate cancer, including quantitative pharmacokinetic PET parameters extracted from 18F-DCFPyL time activity curves generated from dynamic data using a two-tissue compartment model and Patlak plots.  Results: 18F-DCFPyL uptake values were significantly higher in primary prostate tumors than those in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and normal prostate tissue at 5 min, 30 min, and 120 min p.i. (P = 0.0002), when examining both SUVmax and SUVmean values. The two-tissue compartment model found an overall influx value (Ki) of 0.063 in primary prostate cancer, demonstrating a Ki over 15-fold higher in malignant prostate tissue compared with BPH (Ki = 0.004) and normal prostate tissue (Ki = 0.005) (P = 0.0001).  Conclusion:   High-risk primary prostate cancer is readily identified on dynamic and static, delayed, 18F-DCFPyL PET images. The tumor-to-background ratio increases over time, with optimal 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging at 120 min p.i. for evaluation of prostate cancer, but not necessarily ideal for clinical application. Primary prostate cancer demonstrates different uptake kinetics in comparison to BPH and normal prostate tissue. The 15-fold difference in Ki between prostate cancer and non-cancer (BPH and normal) tissues translates to an ability to distinguish prostate cancer from normal tissue at time points as early as 5 to 10 min p.i.""","""['Michelle Lu', 'Liza Lindenberg', 'Esther Mena', 'Baris Turkbey', 'Jurgen Seidel', 'Anita Ton', 'Yolanda McKinney', 'Philip Eclarinal', 'Maria Merino', 'Peter Pinto', 'Peter Choyke', 'Stephen Adler']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mol Imaging Biol""","""['18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in the Detection of Prostate Cancer at 60 and 120 Minutes: Detection Rate, Image Quality, Activity Kinetics, and Biodistribution.', 'Simplified Methods for Quantification of 18F-DCFPyL Uptake in Patients with Prostate Cancer.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', '18FDCFPyL PET/CT for Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', '18F-Labeled Radiotracers for Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen: Historical Perspective and Future Directions.', 'A Systematic Review of the Variability in Performing and Reporting Intraprostatic Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography in Primary Staging Studies.', 'The Performance of FDA-Approved PET Imaging Agents in the Detection of Prostate Cancer.', 'The Role of PSMA PET/CT in the Primary Diagnosis and Follow-Up of Prostate Cancer-A Practical Clinical Review.']"""

PEGylated dipalmitoylphosphatedylethanolamine (DPPE-PEG), covalently linked with 6-hydrazinopyridine-3-carboxylic-acid, was conjugated with new LHRH-receptor positive peptide analog (DPPE-PEG-HYNIC-d-Glu-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-d-Asn-Leu-d-Gln-Pro-Gly-NH2). Surface modified doxorubicin (DOX) loaded solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) was prepared using soylecithin, stearic acid and Poloxamer-188 by solvent emulsification/evaporation method for targeted delivery of DOX into prostate cancer cells. SLN, DOX loaded SLN (DSLN) and surface modified DSLN (M-DSLN) were characterized by means of their size, zeta potential, morphology, storage time, drug payload, and subsequent release kinetics studies. Homogeneity of surface morphology, upon modification of SLN, was revealed from the dynamic light scattering, atomic force microscopy, and scanning electron microscopic studies. Homogeneous adsolubilization of DOX throughout the hydrophobic moiety of SLN was established by the differential scanning calorimetric studies. Release of DOX were sustained in DSLN and M-DSLN. Cellular uptake and in vitro activities of formulations against LHRH positive PC3/SKBR3 cancer cell lines revealed higher cellular internalization, cytotoxicity that followed the sequence DOX < DSLN < M-DSLN.

Secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) is a cardinal mediator of tumor-associated inflammation and facilitates metastasis. In our previous study, we firstly revealed SPP1 was a potential hub signature for predicting metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) development. Herein, we integrated multiple databases to explore the association of SPP1 expression with prognosis, survival, and metastatic levels in CRPC progression and investigated SPP1 expression in PCa tissues and cell lines. Next, PCa cell lines with overexpression or depletion of SPP1 were established to study the effect of SPP1 on enzalutamide sensitivity and adhesion and migration of prostate cancer cell lines and further explore the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Bioinformatics analysis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunohistochemical staining, and western blot results suggested SPP1 upregulation had strong relationship with the malignant progression of CRPC and enzalutamide resistance. SPP1 knockdown enhanced enzalutamide sensitivity and repressed invasion and migration of prostate cancer cells. Importantly, upregulating SPP1 promoted, while silencing SPP1 attenuated epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT).

The purpose of this paper is to explore the correlation between DND1 expression levels and clinical characteristics in prostate cancer (PCa) patients.  Materials and methods:   To assess the expression of DND1 in tumor specimens compared with paired paracancerous tissues, the sample from 83 patients was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was used to verify our results. Subsequently, we statistically analyzed the relationship between DND1 expression and the clinical prognosis of PCa patients.  Results:   Compared with paracancerous tissues, DND1 has a higher expression level in prostate cancer. The overexpression of DND1 in protein level was significantly associated with the higher clinical stage (P = 0.006), ISUP grading group (P < 0.001), seminal vesicle invasion (P = 0.006), and PSA density (P = 0.002).

An accurate diagnosis of its severity at detection plays a major role in improving their survival. Recently, machine learning models using biomarkers identified from Raman micro-spectroscopy discriminated intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDC-P) from cancer tissue with a ≥85 % detection accuracy and differentiated high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) from IDC-P with a ≥97.8 % accuracy.  Aim:   To improve the classification performance of machine learning models identifying different types of prostate cancer tissue using a new dimensional reduction technique.  Approach:   A radial basis function (RBF) kernel support vector machine (SVM) model was trained on Raman spectra of prostate tissue from a 272-patient cohort (Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal, CHUM) and tested on two independent cohorts of 76 patients [University Health Network (UHN)] and 135 patients (Centre hospitalier universitaire de Québec-Université Laval, CHUQc-UL). Two types of engineered features were used. Individual intensity features, i.e., Raman signal intensity measured at particular wavelengths and novel Raman spectra fitted peak features consisting of peak heights and widths.  Results:   Combining engineered features improved classification performance for the three aforementioned classification tasks. The improvements for IDC-P/cancer classification for the UHN and CHUQc-UL testing sets in accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) are (numbers in parenthesis are associated with the CHUQc-UL testing set): +4 % (+8 % ), +7 % (+9 % ), +2 % (6%), +9 (+9) with respect to the current best models. Discrimination between HGPIN and IDC-P was also improved in both testing cohorts: +2.2 % (+1.7 % ), +4.5 % (+3.6 % ), +0 % (+0 % ), +2.3 (+0).

Men with drug use disorders (DUD) may potentially be at high risk for prostate cancer mortality because of delayed diagnosis and/or undertreatment. In this study, we aimed to investigate prostate cancer incidence, mortality, and stage at time of diagnosis among men with DUD compared to the general male population in Sweden.  Methods:   We performed a follow-up study based on Swedish national register data for the period January 1997-December 2016. The study was based on 1,361,532 men aged 50-75 years at inclusion, of whom 9,259 were registered with DUD. Cox regression analysis was used to compute adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for incident and fatal prostate cancer, and cancer stage at time of diagnosis, associated with DUD.  Results:   DUD was associated with a slightly increased risk of incident prostate cancer (HR: 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.14, p = 0.048) and substantially higher risk of fatal prostate cancer (HR: 1.59, 95% CI 1.40-1.82, p < 0.001), adjusted for age, socioeconomic factors, and comorbidities related to tobacco smoking and alcohol use disorder. No association was found between DUD and prostate cancer stage at diagnosis.  Conclusions:   Men with DUD have an increased risk of fatal prostate cancer, possibly related to undertreatment in this patient population. Our findings should raise attention among medical staff and decision-makers towards a disadvantaged group of men in need of easily accessible prostate cancer evaluation and treatment.""","""['Disa Dahlman', 'Xinjun Li', 'Casey Crump', 'Jan Sundquist', 'Kristina Sundquist']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['Drug use disorder and risk of incident and fatal breast cancer: a nationwide epidemiological study.', 'Cervical cancer among Swedish women with drug use disorders: A nationwide epidemiological study.', 'Risk of venous thromboembolism in men with prostate cancer compared with men in the general population: a nationwide population-based cohort study in Sweden.', 'Familial prostate cancer in Sweden.

Projected increases in cancer indicate a 50% increase in the number of cases over the next 2 decades, with the greatest proportional increase in low- and medium-income settings. In contrast to the historic high cancer burden due to viral and bacterial infections in these regions, future increases are expected to be due to cancers linked to westernization including breast, colorectum, lung, and prostate cancer. Identifying the reasons underlying these increases will be paramount to informing prevention efforts. Evidence from epidemiological and laboratory studies conducted in high-income countries over the last 70 years has led to the conclusion that approximately 40% of the cancer burden is explained by known risk factors-the 2 most important being tobacco and obesity in that order-raising the question of what is driving the rest of the cancer burden. International cancer statistics continue to show that approximately 80% of the cancer burden in high-income countries could be preventable in principle, implying that there are important environmental or lifestyle risk factors for cancer that have not yet been discovered. Emerging genomic evidence from population and experimental studies points to an important role for nonmutagenic promoters in driving cancer incidence rates.

Materials and methods:   According to power analysis, 52 male patients were included in this monocenter study with prospective data collection and retrospective, blinded multireader image analysis. The study was approved by the local ethics committee. Patients were recruited from January to December 2020. Based on mpMRI findings, patients underwent in-bore MR biopsy or prostatectomy for histopathologic correlation of suspicious lesions. Three readers, blinded to the histopathologic results and images of mpMRI, independently evaluated ADC maps for the detection of PCa. The ADC ratio was defined as the lowest signal intensity (SI) of lesions divided by the SI of normal tissue in the zone of origin. Predictive accuracy of multiparametric and monoparametric MRI were compared using logistic regression analysis. Moreover, both protocols were compared applying goodness-of-fit analysis with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test for continuous ADC ratios and Pearson χ2 test for binary decision calls, correlation analysis with Spearman ρ and intraclass correlation coefficients, as well as noninferiority assessment with a TOST (""two one-sided test"").  Results:   Eighty-one histopathologically proven, unique PCa lesions (Gleason score [GS] ≥ 3 + 3) in 52 patients could be unequivocally correlated, with 57 clinically significant (cs) PCa lesions (GS ≥ 3 + 4). Multiparametric MRI detected 95%, and monoparametric ADC detected ratios 91% to 93% of csPCa. Noninferiority of monoparametric MRI was confirmed by TOST (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). Logistic regression analysis revealed comparable predictive diagnostic accuracy of ADC ratios (73.7%-87.8%) versus mpMRI (72.2%-84.7%). Spearman rank correlation coefficient for PCa aggressiveness revealed satisfactory correlation of ADC ratios (P < 0.013 for all correlations). The Hosmer-Lemeshow test for the logistic regression analysis for continuous ADC ratios indicated adequate predictive accuracy (P = 0.55-0.87), and the Pearson χ2 test showed satisfactory goodness of fit (P = 0.35-0.69, χ2 = 0.16-0.87).

ROS generated by Nox are involved in multiple signaling cascades and a myriad of pathophysiological conditions including cancer. As such, ROS seem to have both detrimental and beneficial roles in a number of cellular functions, including cell signaling, growth, apoptosis and proliferation. Regulatory mechanisms are required to control the activity of Nox enzymes in order to maintain ROS balance within the cell. Here, we performed genome-wide screening for deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) regulating Nox organizer 1 (NoxO1) protein expression using a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated DUB-knockout library. We identified cylindromatosis (CYLD) as a binding partner regulating NoxO1 protein expression. We demonstrated that the overexpression of CYLD promotes ubiquitination of NoxO1 protein and reduces the NoxO1 protein half-life. The destabilization of NoxO1 protein by CYLD suppressed excessive ROS generation. Additionally, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of CYLD in PC-3 cells promoted cell proliferation, migration, colony formation and invasion in vitro. In xenografted mice, injection of CYLD-depleted cells consistently led to tumor development with increased weight and volume. Taken together, these results indicate that CYLD acts as a destabilizer of NoxO1 protein and could be a potential tumor suppressor target for cancer therapeutics.""","""['Saba Haq', 'Neha Sarodaya', 'Janardhan Keshav Karapurkar', 'Bharathi Suresh', 'Jung Ki Jo', 'Vijai Singh', 'Yun Soo Bae', 'Kye-Seong Kim', 'Suresh Ramakrishna']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""['The Potential of Cylindromatosis (CYLD) as a Therapeutic Target in Oxidative Stress-Associated Pathologies: A Comprehensive Evaluation.', 'NADPH Oxidase 1 Activity and ROS Generation Are Regulated by Grb2/Cbl-Mediated Proteasomal Degradation of NoxO1 in Colon Cancer Cells.', 'Downregulation of miR‑181b inhibits human colon\xa0cancer cell proliferation by targeting CYLD and inhibiting the NF‑κB signaling pathway.', 'IκB kinase promotes Nrf2 ubiquitination and degradation by phosphorylating cylindromatosis, aggravating oxidative stress injury in obesity-related nephropathy.', 'Dissenting degradation: Deubiquitinases in cell cycle and cancer.', 'The Potential of Cylindromatosis (CYLD) as a Therapeutic Target in Oxidative Stress-Associated Pathologies: A Comprehensive Evaluation.', 'CRISPR/Cas9-based genome-wide screening of the deubiquitinase subfamily identifies USP3 as a protein stabilizer of REST blocking neuronal differentiation and promotes neuroblastoma tumorigenesis.', 'Overexpression of a Novel Noxo1 Mutant Increases Ros Production and Noxo1 Relocalisation.', 'Development of a prognostic model for children with neuroblastoma based on necroptosis-related genes.', 'CRISPR/Cas9-based genome-wide screening for deubiquitinase subfamily identifies USP1 regulating MAST1-driven cisplatin-resistance in cancer cells.']"""

While exercise may counter functional declines associated with ADT, no studies have tested whether and which type of exercise may reduce falls and frailty. The purpose of this trial is to compare the relative efficacy of strength training versus tai ji quan training against each other and to a stretching control group on falls, frailty, and physical functioning in men expose to ADT for prostate cancer.  Methods:   Prostate cancer survivors treated with ADT (N = 360) who have fallen in the past year or are at risk of a fall based on validated risk factors will be recruited to participate in this single-blind, parallel group, randomized trial. Participants will be randomized to one of three supervised, group training programs: (i) strength training, (ii) tai ji quan training, or (iii) stretching (control), that train 3×/week for 6 months. Outcomes are assessed at baseline, 3 (mid-intervention), 6 (immediately post-intervention), and 12 (follow-up) months. The primary outcome is falls assessed by monthly self-report. Secondary outcomes include the following: frailty (low lean body mass (by bioelectrical impedance analysis), exhaustion (by SF-36 vitality scale), low activity (by CHAMPS physical activity survey), slowness (by 4 m usual walk speed), and weakness (by chair stand time)); objective and subjective measures of physical function will also be collected. Negative binomial regression models will be used to assess differences in falls between groups, while mixed effects modeling will be used to compare the relative efficacy of training group on secondary outcomes.  Discussion:   Exercise represents a non-pharmacologic approach to mitigate the problem of falls experienced among men treated with ADT. By engaging in appropriate exercise, men may be able to avoid or delay falls, frailty, and disability associated with their cancer treatment. Findings of the trial are expected to inform clinical practice about how exercise could be prescribed as part of cancer care for prostate cancer survivors prescribed ADT.

Patients and methods:   All men diagnosed with synchronous mHSPC from 2010 to 2018 in the Netherlands were identified in the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Men were categorised as having NRLN (M1a), bone (M1b), NRLN and bone (M1c), or visceral metastases (M1c). For men diagnosed since October 2015 disease volume could be determined. Analyses were performed in this cohort (>5600 men) and repeated in the 2010-2018 cohort (>14 000 men). The primary outcome measure in this observational cohort study was overall survival (OS) and Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs).  Results:   Compared to men with NRLN and bone metastases (reference group), OS of men with only NRLN (HR 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55-0.88) was better. This was also true for men with only bone metastases in the low-volume subgroup (HR 0.75, 95% CI0.58-0.98), but not in the high-volume subgroup (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.84-1.18).

Conclusion:   In men with low-volume synchronous mHSPC, presence of concomitant NRLN and bone metastases (currently classified as M1c), is a poor prognostic sign. However, survival of men with visceral metastases (M1c) is worse. Implying that classifying concomitant NRLN and bone metastases as M1c or M1b is not appropriate.

We describe the feasibility, preliminary efficacy, and safety of live online group training and compare to in-person training.  Methods:   Adherence (% sessions attended), retention (% participants completing intervention), and safety (# adverse events) data of resistance training groups from two randomized controlled trials in cancer survivors that participated before or during the COVID-19 pandemic were collated.

This study aimed to investigate the Denonvilliers' fascia using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) to acquire three-dimensional images nondestructively for assessments of the relationship between the Denonvilliers' fascia, the mesorectal fascia, and neurovascular bundles to elucidate the correct anterior total mesorectal excision plane. Eight specimens were obtained bilaterally from four fresh human cadavers. Four specimens were stained with phosphotungstic acid to visualize the soft tissue, and micro-CT images were obtained; the other four specimens were stained with Masson's trichrome to visualize connective tissue. Micro-CT images corroborate that the Denonvilliers' fascia consists of a multilayered structure that separates the rectum from the seminal vesicles and the prostate. Specimens stained with Masson's trichrome showed that the urogenital neurovascular bundle located at the posterolateral corner of the prostate is separated from the mesorectum by the Denonvilliers' fascia. For the preservation of autonomic nerves necessary for urogenital function and optimal oncologic outcomes in patients with rectal cancer, a successful mesorectal excision requires a dissection plane posterior to the Denonvilliers' fascia.""","""['Seung Yoon Yang', 'Ho Seung Kim', 'Min Soo Cho', 'Nam Kyu Kim']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Reconsideration of the Anterior Surgical Plane of Total Mesorectal Excision for Rectal Cancer.', ""Operating behind Denonvilliers' fascia for reliable preservation of urogenital autonomic nerves in total mesorectal excision: a histologic study using cadaveric specimens, including a surgical experiment using fresh cadaveric models."", ""Identification of the surgical indication line for the Denonvilliers' fascia and its anatomy in patients with rectal cancer."", ""Rectal mobilization: the place of Denonvilliers' fascia and inconsistencies in the literature."", ""Anatomy of Denonvilliers' fascia and pelvic nerves, impotence, and implications for the colorectal surgeon."", 'Posteromedial capsular anatomy of the tibia for consideration of the medial meniscal support structure using a multidimensional analysis.', 'Application of Hydrogel Spacer SpaceOAR Vue for Prostate Radiotherapy.', 'Significance of the anatomical relationship between the flexor digitorum longus and sustentaculum tali for reconsideration of the talocalcaneonavicular joint stability mechanism.']"""

Nevertheless, how it participates in the progression of human cancers, especially HCC, is still unknown. In the present study, we found that STEAP3 was aberrantly overexpressed in the nuclei of HCC cells. In a large cohort of clinical HCC tissues, high expression level of nuclear STEAP3 was positively associated with tumor differentiation and poor prognosis (p < 0.001), and it was an independent prognostic factor for HCC patients. In HCC cell lines, nuclear expression of STEAP3 significantly promoted HCC cells proliferation by promoting stemness phenotype and cell cycle progression via RAC1-ERK-STAT3 and RAC1-JNK-STAT6 signaling axes. Through upregulating the expression and nuclear trafficking of EGFR, STEAP3 participated in regulating EGFR-mediated STAT3 transactivity in a manner of positive feedback. In summary, our findings support that nuclear expression of STEAP3 plays a critical oncogenic role in the progression of HCC via modulation on EGFR and intracellular signaling, and it could be a candidate for prognostic marker and therapeutic target in HCC.""","""['Li-Li Wang#', 'Jie Luo#', 'Zhang-Hai He', 'Ye-Qing Liu', 'Hai-Gang Li', 'Dan Xie', 'Mu-Yan Cai']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['T-box transcription factor 19 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis through upregulating EGFR and RAC1.', 'miR-500a-3p promotes cancer stem cells properties via STAT3 pathway in human hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Anticancer activity of dietary xanthone α-mangostin against hepatocellular carcinoma by inhibition of STAT3 signaling via stabilization of SHP1.', 'STK39 is a novel kinase contributing to the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma by the PLK1/ERK signaling pathway.', 'Deciphering STAT3 signaling potential in hepatocellular carcinoma: tumorigenesis, treatment resistance, and pharmacological significance.', 'Identification of STEAP3-based molecular subtype and risk model in ovarian cancer.', 'Upregulation of the ferroptosis-related STEAP3 gene is a specific predictor of poor triple-negative breast cancer patient outcomes.', 'Identification of actionable targets for breast cancer intervention using a diversity outbred mouse model.', 'Identification and Validation of a Novel Prognostic Signature Based on Ferroptosis-Related Genes in Ovarian Cancer.', 'NRP1 promotes prostate cancer progression via modulating EGFR-dependent AKT pathway activation.']"""

We aimed to identify a potential targetable marker relevant to prostate cancer and develop novel immunotherapy.  Experimental design:   Analysis of transcriptomic profiles at single-cell resolution was performed in clinical patients' samples, along with integrated analysis of multiple RNA-sequencing datasets. The antitumor activity of YY001, a novel EP4 antagonist, combined with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo.  Results:   We identified EP4 (PTGER4) as expressed in epithelial cells and various immune cells and involved in modulating the prostate cancer immune microenvironment. YY001, a novel EP4 antagonist, inhibited the differentiation, maturation, and immunosuppressive function of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) while enhancing the proliferation and anticancer functions of T cells. Furthermore, it reversed the infiltration levels of MDSCs and T cells in the tumor microenvironment by overturning the chemokine profile of tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. The combined immunotherapy demonstrated a robust antitumor immune response as indicated by the robust accumulation and activation of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, with a significantly decreased MDSC ratio and reduced MDSC immunosuppression function.  Conclusions:   Our study identified EP4 as a specific target for prostate cancer immunotherapy and demonstrated that YY001 inhibited the growth of prostate tumors by regulating the immune microenvironment and strongly synergized with anti-PD-1 antibodies to convert completely unresponsive prostate cancers into responsive cancers, resulting in marked tumor regression, long-term survival, and lasting immunologic memory.""","""['Shihong Peng#', 'Pan Hu#', 'Yu-Tian Xiao#', 'Weiqiang Lu#', 'Dandan Guo', 'Shixiu Hu', 'Jiayi Xie', 'Minna Wang', 'Weiwei Yu', 'Junjie Yang', 'Huang Chen', 'Xiaomin Zhang', 'Yasheng Zhu', 'Ye Wang', 'Yue Yang', 'Guanghui Zhu', 'Sujun Chen', 'Jian Wang', 'Bo Zhang', 'Weidong Chen', 'Huangan Wu', 'Zhenliang Sun', 'Tao Ding', 'Hankun Zhang', 'Zhengfang Yi', 'Mingyao Liu', 'Shancheng Ren']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Prostaglandin E Receptor 4 Antagonist in Cancer Immunotherapy: Mechanisms of Action.', 'Effective combinatorial immunotherapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Reduction of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in cholangiocarcinoma by ex vivo targeting immune checkpoint molecules.', 'Functional and mechanistic advantage of the use of a bifunctional anti-PD-L1/IL-15 superagonist.', 'Emerging role of immunotherapy in urothelial carcinoma-Immunobiology/biomarkers.', 'Exploring the Onset and Progression of Prostate Cancer through a Multicellular Agent-based Model.', 'Inhibition of CDC20 potentiates anti-tumor immunity through facilitating GSDME-mediated pyroptosis in prostate cancer.', 'PGE2-EP2/EP4 signaling elicits mesoCAR T cell immunosuppression in pancreatic cancer.', 'Advances in landscape and related therapeutic targets of the prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'New insights and options into the mechanisms and effects of combined targeted therapy and immunotherapy in prostate cancer.']"""

Experimental design:   Genomic profiling using a targeted next-generation sequencing assay examining 324-465 genes (FoundationOne, FoundationOne Heme, and FoundationOne CDx; Foundation Medicine, Inc.) was performed in a cohort of 160,790 samples across different tumor types. Zygosity predictions and gLOH status were calculated and linked with alterations in 18 HRR-associated genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, BARD1, ATR, ATRX, ATM, BAP1, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, BRIP1, NBN, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCA, FANCC, MRE11) and other genomic features, using Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U tests.  Results:   We identified a strong correlation between elevated gLOH and biallelic alterations in a core set of HRR-associated genes beyond BRCA1 and BRCA2, such as BARD1, PALB2, FANCC, RAD51C, and RAD51D (particularly in breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancer). Monoallelic/heterozygous alterations in HRR-associated genes were not associated with elevated gLOH. gLOH was also independently associated with TP53 loss. Co-occurrence of TP53 loss and alterations in HRR-associated genes, and combined loss of TP53-PTEN or TP53-RB1, was associated with a higher gLOH than each of the events separately.  Conclusions:   Biallelic alterations in core HRR-associated genes are frequent, strongly associated with elevated gLOH, and enriched in breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancer.

In this study, we identified a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), NXTAR (LOC105373241) that is located convergent with the AR gene and is repressed in human prostate tumors and cell lines. NXTAR bound upstream of the AR promoter and promoted EZH2 recruitment, causing significant loss of AR (and AR-V7) expression. Paradoxically, AR bound the NXTAR promoter, and inhibition of AR by the ACK1/TNK2 small molecule inhibitor (R)-9b excluded AR from the NXTAR promoter. The histone acetyltransferase GCN5 bound and deposited H3K14 acetylation marks, enhancing NXTAR expression. Application of an oligonucleotide derived from NXTAR exon 5 (NXTAR-N5) suppressed AR/AR-V7 expression and prostate cancer cell proliferation, indicating the translational relevance of the negative regulation of AR. In addition, pharmacologic restoration of NXTAR using (R)-9b abrogated enzalutamide-resistant prostate xenograft tumor growth. Overall, this study uncovers a positive feedback loop, wherein NXTAR acts as a novel prostate tumor-suppressing lncRNA by inhibiting AR/AR-V7 expression, which in turn upregulates NXTAR levels, compromising enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer. The restoration of NXTAR could serve as a new therapeutic modality for patients who have acquired resistance to second generation AR antagonists.

Methods and materials:   Eligible patients had low/intermediate risk prostate cancer (PCa) before EBRT and biopsy-proven LF >30 months after EBRT, with prostate-specific antigen <10 ng/mL and no regional/distant disease. The primary endpoint, late gastrointestinal and genitourinary adverse events (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0) grade ≥3 were 14%. With minimum 5-year follow-up after salvage BT, secondary clinical outcomes including disease-free survival (DFS; includes death from any cause), disease-specific survival, and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and modelled using Cox proportional hazards regression. Local tumor progression (ie, LF), distant failure (DF), and biochemical failure (BF) were estimated using cumulative incidence. Time to LF, DF, and BF were modeled by cause-specific Cox proportional hazards regression.  Results:   From May 2007 to January 2014, 20 centers registered 100 patients (92 analyzable).

We evaluated the course of patient-reported acute symptoms during HF versus standard fractionated (SF) radiation therapy within the hypofractionated irradiation for prostate cancer (HYPRO) trial.  Methods and materials:   In the HYPRO trial patients were treated with either 64.4 Gy (HF) in 19 fractions (3 times per week) or 78 Gy (SF) in 39 fractions (5 times per week). Normalized total dose for 2 Gy/fractions (NTD2Gy)for acute toxicity (α/β ratio of 10) for HF was 72.1 Gy with a similar dose rate of 10.2 Gy per week. Among the 794 patients who were previously eligible for acute grade ≥2 toxicity assessment, 717 had filled out ≥1 symptom questionnaires. For each maximum symptom, we scored ""any complaint"" and ""moderate-severe complaint."" Differences were tested by χ2 test, and associations with clinical factors were tested using logistic regression. Significance was set at P ≤ .008 to adjust for multiple testing.  Results:   We observed significantly higher rates of moderate-severe painful defecation (HF 10.8%, SF 5.3%), any mucus discharge (HF 47.1%, SF 37.4%), any rectal blood loss (HF 16.1%, SF 9.3%), increased daily stool frequency ≥4 and ≥6 (HF 34.6%/13.8%, SF 25.6%/7.0%), and any urinary straining (HF 69.9%, SF 58.0%). At 3 months postradiation therapy, rates dropped considerably with similar levels for HF and SF. Hormonal treatment was associated with less acute gastrointestinal symptoms.  Conclusion:   The increased patient-reported acute rectal symptoms with HF confirmed the previously reported results on acute grade ≥2 rectal toxicity. The increase in bladder symptoms with HF was not identified previously. These observations contradict the NTD2Gy calculations. We observed no patterns of persisting complaints with HF after the acute period; therefore, HF is well tolerated and only associated with a temporary increase of symptoms.""","""['Felix Sinzabakira', 'Wilma D Heemsbergen', 'Floris J Pos', 'Luca Incrocci']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Acute and late toxicity patterns of moderate hypo-fractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Ultra-hypofractionated versus conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: 5-year outcomes of the HYPO-RT-PC randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial.', 'Hypofractionated versus conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for patients with prostate cancer (HYPRO): acute toxicity results from a randomised non-inferiority phase 3 trial.', 'Hypofractionated versus conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for patients with prostate cancer (HYPRO): late toxicity results from a randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial.', 'A Story of Hypofractionation and the Table on the Wall.', 'Acute and late toxicity patterns of moderate hypo-fractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

UF presentation typically includes debilitating pelvic pain exacerbated with ambulation. Traditional management required open surgical genitourinary (GU) reconstruction with pubectomy leading to significant morbidity. However, progressive utilization of robotic approaches and advances in holmium laser technology has led to a less invasive alternative. Herein, we present our series of robotic-assisted holmium laser debridement of pubic osteomyelitis in the setting of UF.  Methods:   After physical exam, all patients presenting with concerns for GU fistula and osteomyelitis are evaluated with BMP, CBC, serum albumin, urine culture, and cystoscopy. Patients often present with previously obtained CT abdomen/pelvis. However, all patients presenting with concerns of pubic osteomyelitis should undergo a MRI of the pelvis to characterize the pubis. Specific indications for holmium laser debridement of the pubic bone include: 1) history of sacral insufficiency fractures which eliminate management with partial pubectomy due to risk of pelvic ring instability and 2) mild osteomyelitis which can be managed with debridement. The patient is placed in dorsal lithotomy position. After the robot is docked, the space of retzius is developed and the fistula is resected down to the pubic bone. The symphysis is debrided using the Cobra grasper followed by holmium laser debridement at 2J and 50Hz settings. Appropriate GU reconstruction versus urinary diversion is then performed per clinical judgement. Antibiotic beads are then placed in the symphyseal defect. If available, an interposition flap may be advanced between the urethra/bladder and symphysis.  Results:   In our series of four patients, all patients underwent successful robotic pubic symphyseal debridement and were discharged without experiencing a major complication. At follow up (7-16 months) there have been no fistula recurrence or recurrent episodes of osteomyelitis.  Conclusion:   Robotic assisted pubic symphyseal debridement with a holmium laser is feasible, safe, and efficacious in this small series with short follow up. This approach represents a minimally invasive alternative to open pubectomy while minimizing incisions and overall morbidity. Additional long-term data is necessary before wide spread adoption of this approach.""","""['Kevin J Hebert', 'Timothy C Boswell', 'Elizabeth Bearrick', 'Jack R Andrews', 'Jason P Joseph', 'Boyd R Viers']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Robot Assisted Cystectomy With Holmium Laser Debridement for Osteomyelitis of the Pubic Symphysis With Urinary Fistula.', 'Urosymphyseal Fistulas Resulting From Endoscopic Treatment of Radiation-induced Posterior Urethral Strictures.', 'Pubectomy and urinary reconstruction provides definitive treatment of urosymphyseal fistula following prostate cancer treatment.', 'Resection of Pubic Symphysis and Cystectomy Significantly Improves Short-Term Patient-Reported Physical Functioning Among Patients With Pubovesical Fistula and Pubic Bone Osteomyelitis.', 'Infectious Inflammation of Pubic Symphysis (Symphysitis Pubis Purulenta): Five Case Reports and Literature View.']"""

NEPC has the most aggressive biologic behavior of all prostate cancers and is associated with poor patient outcome. Effective treatment for NEPC is not available because NEPC exhibit distinct cell-surface expression profiles compared to other types of prostate cancer. Recently, the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) (known as CEA or CD66e) was suggested to be a specific surface protein marker for NEPC. Therefore, we identified a new, fully-human anti-CEACAM5 monoclonal antibody, 1G9, which bound to the most proximal membrane domains, A3 and B3, of CEACAM5 with high affinity and specificity. It shows no off-target binding to other CEACAM family members, membrane distal domains of CEACAM5, or 5800 human membrane proteins. IgG1 1G9 exhibited CEACAM5-specific ADCC activity toward CEACAM5-positive prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) based on scFv 1G9 induced specific and strong antitumor activity in a mouse model of prostate cancer.

This study compared planned (DP) vs accumulated doses (DA) obtained from daily cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans in high-risk- prostate cancer with pelvic lymph nodes irradiation. An intensity-based deformable image registration algorithm used to estimate contours for DA was validated using geometrical agreement between radiation oncologist's and deformable image registration algorithm propagated contours. Spearman rank correlations (rs) between geometric measures and changes in organ volumes were evaluated for 20 cases. Dose-volume (DV) differences between DA and DP were compared (Wilcoxon rank test, p < 0.05). A novel region-of-interest (ROI) method was developed and mean doses were analyzed. Geometrical measures for the prostate and organ-at-risk contours were within clinically acceptable criteria. Inter-group mean (± SD) CBCT volumes for the rectum were larger compared to planning CT (pCT) (51.1 ± 11.3 cm3vs 46.6 ± 16.1 cm3), and were moderately correlated with variations in pCT volumes, rs = 0.663, p < 0.01. Mean rectum DV for DA was higher at V30-40 Gy and lower at V70-75 Gy, p < 0.05. Mean bladder CBCT volumes were smaller compared to pCT (198.8 ± 55 cm3vs 211.5 ± 89.1 cm3), and was moderately correlated with pCT volumes, rs = 0.789, p < 0.01. Bladder DA was higher at V30-65 Gy and lower at V70-75 Gy (p < 0.05). For the ROI method, rectum and bladder DA were lower at 5 to 10 mm (p < 0.01) as compared to DP, whilst bladder DA was higher than DP at 20 to 50 mm (p < 0.01).

Up to a third of patients may require further local salvage treatment after ablative therapy failure. Limited descriptive, but no comparative, evidence exists between different salvage treatment outcomes. The aim of this study was to compare oncological and functional outcomes after salvage robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (SRARP) and salvage radiotherapy (SRT).  Materials and methods:   Data were collected prospectively and retrospectively on 100 consecutive SRARP cases and 100 consecutive SRT cases after ablative therapy failure in a high-volume tertiary centre.  Results:   High-risk patients were over-represented in the SRARP group (66.0%) compared with the SRT group (48.0%) (P = 0.013). The median (interquartile range) follow-up after SRARP was 16.5 (10.0-30.0) months and 37.0 (18.5-64.0) months after SRT. SRT appeared to confer greater biochemical recurrence-free survival at 1, 2 and 3 years compared with SRARP in high-risk patients (year 3: 86.3% versus 66.0%), but biochemical recurrence-free survival was similar for intermediate-risk patients (year 3: 90.0% versus 75.6%). There was no statistical difference in pad-free continence at 12 and 24 months between SRARP (77.2 and 84.7%) and SRT (75.0 and 74.0%) (P = 0.724, 0.114). Erectile function was more likely to be preserved in men who underwent SRT. After SRT, cumulative bowel and urinary Radiation Therapy Oncology Group toxicity grade I were 25.0 and 45.0%, grade II were 11.0 and 11.0% and grade III or IV complications were 4.0 and 5.0%, respectively.  Conclusion:   We report the first comparative analyses of salvage prostatectomy and radiotherapy following ablative therapy. Men with high-risk disease appear to have superior oncological outcomes after SRT; however, treatment allocation does not appear to influence oncological outcomes for men with intermediate-risk disease. Treatment allocation was associated with a different spectrum of toxicity profile.

There is currently no effective treatment to cure this deadly prostate cancer (PCa) progression. However, recent research showed that activation of lipogenesis leads to CRPC progression. It provides a rationale to target the highly lipogenic activity as a novel and promising therapy against lethal CRPC.  Purposes:   The present study aims to evaluate the anticancer efficacy and the molecular mechanism of cell suspension culture extract from Eriobotrya japonica (EJCE) in PCa, including CRPC.  Methods:   Cell growth, migration and invasion analyses were performed by MTT method, a wound healing assay and the transwell method, respectively. Apoptosis was assessed by a flow cytometry-based Annexin V-FITC/PI assay, caspase enzymatic activity and Western blot analyses. Lipogenesis was determined by a Fatty Acid Quantification Kit and an Oil Red O staining. The in vivo experiment was conducted by a xenograft mouse model.  Results:   PCa cell growth, migration and invasion were significantly affected by EJCE. EJCE decreased expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) in PCa cells, two main factors for lipogenesis. By inhibiting SREBP-1/FASN, EJCE reduced the intracellular fatty acid levels and lipid droplet accumulation in PCa. Moreover, EJCE down-regulated the androgen receptor (AR) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in PCa cells. Significantly, EJCE exhibited the potential anticancer activity by suppressing the growth and leading to apoptosis of CRPC tumors in a xenograft mouse model.  Conclusion:   These results reveal a novel therapeutic molecular mechanism of EJCE in PCa.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), as a significant class of gene expression regulators, play a critical role in immune regulation. The purpose of this study is to explore a new immune related lncRNA signature to exactly predict the prognosis of PRAD patients. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide comparative analysis of lncRNA expression profiles in 532 patients with PRAD from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The immune-related lncRNAs were identified by Cox regression model, and then a new five immune-related lncRNAs signature (FRMD6-AS2, AC008770.3, AC109460.3, AC011899.2, and AC008063.1) were constructed, which could predict the prognosis of PRAD patients. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the signature could be an independent prognostic indicator of overall survival (OS). Through further study of different clinic-pathological parameters, we found that PRAD samples can be divided into high-risk groups with shorter OS and low-risk groups with longer OS by the signature. Principal component analysis showed that five immune-related lncRNA signature could distinguish the high-risk group from low-risk group in view of the immune-related lncRNAs. The difference of immune status between the two groups was observed by gene set enrichment analysis and the ESTIMATE algorithm. Except FRMD6-AS2, the expression of the other 4 lncRNAs were remarkably up-regulated in tumor tissues. In conclusion, the identified five immune-related lncRNAs signature had important clinical significance in prognosis prediction, and can be used as potential immunotherapy targets for PRAD patients.""","""['Linghui Liang', 'Wei Xia', 'Liangyu Yao', 'Qikai Wu', 'Lixin Hua', 'Gong Cheng', 'Zengjun Wang', 'Ruizhe Zhao']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int Immunopharmacol""","""['Immune Infiltration Subtypes Characterization and Identification of Prognosis-Related lncRNAs in Adenocarcinoma of the Esophagogastric Junction.', 'A robust signature of immune-related long non-coding RNA to predict the prognosis of bladder cancer.', 'Identification of a five-long non-coding RNA signature to improve the prognosis prediction for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Molecular Landscape of LncRNAs in Prostate Cancer: A focus on pathways and therapeutic targets for intervention.', 'Long non-coding RNAs and their potential impact on diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy in prostate cancer: racial, ethnic, and geographical considerations.', 'A lncRNA-immune checkpoint-related gene signature predicts metastasis-free survival in prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Lnc-PKD2-2-3/miR-328/GPAM ceRNA Network Induces Cholangiocarcinoma Proliferation, Invasion and 5-FU Chemoresistance.']"""

The aim of current study is to illustrate the potential mechanisms of PAH-mediated regulation of bone metastasis and osteoclastogenesis in prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines. Effects of PAH on proliferation, invasion and migration of PC-3 cells were assessed with the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and Transwell assays, respectively. Effects of PAH on stem cell characteristics of PC-3 cells were evaluated by cell-matrix adhesion assay, colony formation assay, spheroid formation assay, as well as western blot . The anti-metastasis and anti-osteoclastogenesis activity of PAH in RAW264.7 cells was examined by osteoclast differentiation assay and western blot. The protein levels of CD133 and CD44 in PC-3 cells and the activity of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway in RAW264.7 cells were measured by western blot. PAH suppressed proliferation, invasion and migration of PC-3 cells, prevented stem cell characteristics including cell-matrix adhesion, colony formation, spheroid formation as well as CD133 and CD44 expression. PAH inhibited bone metastasis and osteoclastogenesis via repressing the activation of NF-κB pathway as well as (RANKL) - and cancer cell-induced osteoclastogenesis in PCa cells.

However, ADT may increase the expression of androgen receptor (AR) through the amplification of chromosome X. The gene oligophrenin 1 (OPHN1) is located in the same region as the AR gene, which could be amplified by ADT. Thus, the role of OPHN1 in PCa pathology was investigated. The expression status of OPHN1 in PCa was searched in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Androgen‑sensitive cells LNCaP and 22RV1 were cultured under ADT conditions, and then the expression of OPHN1 was evaluated by northern blotting. The expression of OPHN1 was enhanced or knocked down in LNCaP and 22RV1 cells by transfection. Subsequently, the LNCaP and 22RV1 cells were cultured under ADT, and the viability rate, apoptosis, and migration of cells were assessed by MTT, flow cytometry, and Transwell assay respectively. The expression of OPHN1 was also enhanced or knocked down in androgen‑insensitive PC3 cells, and then the effects of OPHN1 on the viability, apoptosis, and migration of PC3 cells were assessed. A mouse xenograft model was created by injecting LNCaP cells with OPHN1 overexpression subcutaneously, and the tumor growth rates were monitored. In TCGA database, amplification of the OPHN1 gene was observed in the PCa tumors. ADT increased the expression of OPHN1 in LNCaP and 22RV1 cells (P<0.05). OPHN1 could promote resistance of LNCaP and 22RV1 cells to ADT by promoting cell survival and preventing their apoptosis (P<0.05). In addition, OPHN1 contributed to cell viability (P<0.05) and enhanced the migration ability in LNCaP, 22RV1 and PC3 cells (P<0.05). In the mouse model, the PCa xenograft with OPHN1 overexpression had a higher growth rate and was more resistant to the ADT condition (P<0.05). In summary, ADT induced the overexpression of OPHN1 in PCa, which facilitated PCa cell survival and promoted PCa progression.""","""['Junjiang Liu#', 'Yunxia Zhang#', 'Shoubin Li', 'Fuzhen Sun', 'Gang Wang', 'Dong Wei', 'Tao Yang', 'Shouyi Gu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Galectin-3 Is Implicated in Tumor Progression and Resistance to Anti-androgen Drug Through Regulation of Androgen Receptor Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Metformin represses androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancers by targeting androgen receptor.', 'Gli2 mediates the development of castration‑resistant prostate cancer.', 'Molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Mechanisms of Prostate Cancer Cells Survival and Their Therapeutic Targeting.', 'Fixing the GAP: The role of RhoGAPs in cancer.']"""

This score includes the assessment of technical parameters that can be obtained from the DICOM files along with a visual evaluation of certain features on prostate MRI (e.g., anatomical structures). We retrospectively analysed the image quality of 10 scans from different vendors and magnets using a semiautomated dedicated PI-QUAL software program and compared the time needed for assessing image quality using two methods (semiautomated assessment versus manual filling of the scoring sheet). This semiautomated software is able to assess the technical parameters automatically, but the visual assessment is still performed by the radiologist. There was a significant reduction in the reporting time of prostate mpMRI quality according to PI-QUAL using the dedicated software program compared to manual filling (5'54″ versus 7'59″; p = 0.005).

Several countries have established on-site SSC in routine care. Previous analyses have shown that SSC utilization varies across cancer centers. This analysis investigates patient and center-level predictors that explain variations in SSC utilization between centers.  Methods:   Logistic multilevel analysis was performed with data from 19,865 prostate cancer patients from 102 prostate cancer centers in Germany and Switzerland. Data was collected within an observational study between July 2016 and June 2020 using survey (online and paper) and tumor documentation.  Results:   The intraclass correlation coefficient for the null model implies that 51% of variance in SSC utilization is attributable to the center a patient is treated in. Patients aged 80 years and older, with higher education, private insurance, without comorbidities, localized intermediate risk, and undergoing androgen deprivation therapy before study inclusion were less likely to utilize SSC. Undergoing primary radiotherapy, active surveillance, or watchful waiting as compared to prostatectomy was associated with a lower likelihood of SSC utilization. Significant negative predictors at the center level were university hospital, center's location in Switzerland, and a short period of certification.  Conclusion:   The results show that patient and center characteristics contribute to explaining the variance in SSC utilization in prostate cancer centers to a large extent. The findings may indicate different organizational processes in the countries included and barriers in the sectoral structure of the healthcare system. In-depth analyses of processes within cancer centers may provide further insights into the reasons for variance in SSC utilization.""","""['Clara Breidenbach', 'Lena Ansmann', 'Nora Tabea Sibert', 'Simone Wesselmann', 'Sebastian Dieng', 'Ernst-Günther Carl', 'Günter Feick', 'Cindy Stoklossa', 'Anne Taubert', 'Amanda Pomery', 'Burkhard Beyer', 'Andreas Blana', 'Marko Brock', 'Florian Distler', 'Michael Enge', 'Amr A Gaber', 'Christian Gilfrich', 'Andreas Hinkel', 'Björn Kaftan', 'Thomas Knoll', 'Frank Kunath', 'Simba-Joshua Oostdam', 'Inga Peters', 'Bülent Polat', 'Valentin Schrodi', 'Friedemann Zengerling', 'Christoph Kowalski']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['Use of psycho-oncological services by prostate cancer patients: A multilevel analysis.', 'Use of social service counseling by cancer patients: an analysis of quality assurance data of 6339 breast cancer patients from 13 certified centers in Germany treated between 2015 and 2017.', ""Incorporating psychosocial care into routine oncological care: Insights into challenges and strategies from certified cancer centers' audit data."", 'Systematic review: comparative effectiveness and harms of treatments for clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Therapies for Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer: A Comparative Effectiveness Review.']"""

Although the number of MPM cases is predicted to increase, no effective standard therapies have been established. The novel radiosensitizer α-sulfoquinovosyl-acylpropanediol (SQAP) enhances the effects of γ-radiation in human lung and prostate cancer cell lines and in animal models. In this study, we explored the radiosensitizing effect of SQAP and its mechanisms in MPM. The human MPM cell lines MSTO-211H and MESO-4 were implanted subcutaneously into the backs and thoracic cavities of immunodeficient KSN/Slc mice, then 2 mg/kg SQAP was intravenously administered with or without irradiation with a total body dose of 8 Gy. In both the orthotopic and ectopic xenograft murine models, the combination of irradiation plus SQAP delayed the implanted human MSTO-211H tumor growth. The analysis of the changes in the relative tumor volume of the MSTO-211H indicated a statistically significant difference after 8 Gy total body combined with 2 mg/kg SQAP, compared to both the untreated control (P = 0.0127) and the radiation treatment alone (P = 0.0171). After the treatment in each case, immunostaining of the harvested tumors revealed decreased cell proliferation, increased apoptosis and normalization of tumor blood vessels in the SQAP- and irradiation-treated group. Furthermore, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1 mRNA and protein expression were decreased, indicating reoxygenation in this group.

Associations with cancer mortality are not well studied, and whether associations are similar across race is unknown.  Methods:   We conducted a prospective analysis of 12 997 cancer-free participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study who were never users at visit 1 (1987-1989). Ever use, duration of use, and age at first use were modeled as time-dependent variables using Cox regression to estimate associations with total, obesity- and smoking-associated, bladder, breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer incidence and mortality.  Results:   We ascertained 3869 cancer cases and 1661 cancer deaths in 237 999 or more person-years. At 6 years of follow-up, 70.8% of lipid-lowering drug use was a statin. Compared with never use, ever use was associated with lower total, obesity- and smoking-associated cancer mortality and with colorectal cancer mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.32 to 0.79) and incidence (HR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.53 to 0.92). Inverse associations were consistent by sex and race. Shorter-term use was associated with bladder cancer incidence in men (<10 years: HR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.02 to 2.73). First use at age 60 years or older was inversely associated with: total mortality, obesity- and smoking-associated mortality, and colorectal cancer mortality; and total incidence, obesity- and smoking-associated incidence, and breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer incidence.

Despite an abundance of prostate-specific antigens, immunotherapies have yet to become a standard of care, potentially limited by T-cell dysfunction. Up to 10% of human circulating T-cells, and a significant fraction in the urogenital tract, are mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. MAIT cells express stereotyped T-cell receptors that recognize riboflavin metabolites derived from microbes presented by MR-1. We evaluated the number, phenotype and function of circulating MAIT cells, alongside two other innate-like T (ILT) -cell subsets, in men with prostate cancer and age- and sex-matched controls. MAIT cells in men with prostate cancer circulated at similar frequencies to controls, but their cytokine production and proliferation was impaired. In contrast, the function of two other ILT-cell populations (natural killer T-cells and Vγ9Vδ2 T-cells) was not impaired. In both patients and controls, MAIT cells expressed high levels of the immune checkpoint molecule PD-1 at rest, while upregulation of PD-1 in response to the MR-1 ligand 5-amino-6D-ribitylaminouracil (5-A-RU) was greater in patients. 5-A-RU also induced upregulation of PD-L1 and -L2 RNA in primary mononuclear cells. We confirmed that circulating MAIT cell number and function were preserved before and during anti-PD1 therapy with pembrolizumab in a cohort of patients with melanoma. In vitro, 5-A-RU enhanced mononuclear cell cytotoxicity against the PD-L1 positive prostate cancer cell line PC3 in an MR-1-dependent manner. Addition of pembrolizumab enhanced this cytotoxicity, and was associated with increased MAIT cell expression of CD107a and IFN-γ. We conclude that prostate cancer is associated with MAIT-cell dysfunction, and that this might be overcome through the application of potent MR-1 ligands with PD-1 blockade.

KLF5 and AR physically interact on chromatin and drive opposing transcriptional programs, with KLF5 promoting cellular migration, anchorage-independent growth, and basal epithelial cell phenotypes. We identify ERBB2 as a point of transcriptional convergence displaying activation by KLF5 and repression by AR. ERBB2 inhibitors preferentially block KLF5-driven oncogenic phenotypes.

Salvage robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (S-RARP) is a possible option after FT failure.  Objective:   To evaluate the impact of FT on functional and oncological outcomes following S-RARP.  Design, setting, and participants:   In a retrospective analysis of data from a prospectively collected institutional database, 53 patients who underwent S-RARP following failure of focal ablation were selected as group I; patients who had whole-gland ablation and external beam therapy were excluded. This group was matched to a control sample (matched at ratios of 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4) of men who had undergone primary RARP, using age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), PSA density, body mass index, Sexual Health Inventory for Men score, American Urological Association symptom score, Charlson comorbidity index, prostate weight, preoperative Gleason score (GS), and history of smoking as variables.  Surgical procedure:   S-RARP after FT was performed using a standardized technique developed at our institute with the da Vinci Xi Surgical System.  Measurements:   Oncological and functional outcomes were compared between the S-RARP and primary RARP groups.  Results and limitations:   There was no difference in estimated blood loss (p = 0.8) between the 1:1 matched groups, but operating room time was significantly longer for S-RARP (p = 0.007).

The S-RARP group had higher incidence of positive surgical margins (40% vs 15%; p = 0.008), GS ≥8 (25% vs 15%; p = 0.07), and positive lymph node status (9.4% vs 5.7%; p = 0.02). There was no significant difference in overall complications between the groups. The primary RARP group had a higher incidence of lymphocele drainage after surgery (15% vs 0%; p = 0.006). The main limitation of the study is its retrospective design.  Conclusions:   S-RALP after FT failure is feasible; however, surgery following FT leads to poorer oncological and functional outcomes. Despite the targeted nature of FT, significant nonfocal collateral damage is evident in tissues surrounding the prostate, which in turn translates to poorer functional outcomes after S-RARP.  Patient summary:   We studied the surgical challenges during robot-assisted removal of the prostate after previous focal treatment (FT) for prostate cancer and compared the outcomes to those for robot-assisted prostate removal in patients who had no previous FT. We found that this technique is safe and effective with a limited risk of complications, but poor urinary and sexual functional outcomes.""","""['K R Seetharam Bhat', 'Marcio Covas Moschovas', 'Marco Sandri', 'Jonathan Noel', 'Sunil Reddy', 'Roshane Perera', 'Travis Rogers', 'Shannon Roof', 'Vipul R Patel']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Re: K.R.

Prostate specific antigen is an important biomarker of prostate cancer, which ranks high among cancer-related deaths of men over 50 years old. Herein, a novel analytical method was introduced for detection of PSA by combining high selectivity of molecularly-imprinted polymers and high sensitivity of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Firstly, magnetic nanoparticles were grafted with an imprinted layer by using tannic acid as a functional monomer, diethylenetriamine as a cross-linker and prostate specific antigen as a template molecule. Detailed surface characterization and re-binding experiment results indicated that the imprinting of the antigen was successful with an imprinting factor of 5.58. The prepared magnetic molecularly imprinted polymers (MMIPs) were used as an antibody-free capture probe and labeled with gold nanoparticles that were modified with anti-PSA and a Raman reporter, namely 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid). Thus, a plasmonic structure (sandwich complex) was formed between MMIP and the SERS label. The limit of detection and limit of quantification of the designed sensor were 0.9 pg/mL and 3.2 pg/mL, respectively. The sensor also showed high recovery rates (98.0-100.1% for healthy person and 99.0-101.3% for patient) with low standard deviations (less than 4.3% for healthy person and less than 3.3% for patient) for PSA in serum samples. Compared with the traditional immunoassays, the proposed method has several advantages like low cost, reduced detection procedure, fast response, high sensitivity and selectivity. It is believed that the proposed method can be potentially used for selective and sensitive determination of tumor marker of prostate cancer in clinical applications.""","""['Eylem Turan', 'Adem Zengin', 'Zekiye Suludere', 'Nurhan Önal Kalkan', 'Uğur Tamer']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Talanta""","""['Dual-modality impedimetric immunosensor for early detection of prostate-specific antigen and myoglobin markers based on antibody-molecularly imprinted polymer.', 'Sensitive and selective ""signal-off"" electrochemiluminescence sensing of prostate-specific antigen based on an aptamer and molecularly imprinted polymer.', 'Label-free MIP-SERS biosensor for sensitive detection of colorectal cancer biomarker.', 'Molecularly imprinted polymer grafted on paper and flat sheet for selective sensing and diagnosis: a review.', 'Molecularly Imprinted Polymers for the Determination of Cancer Biomarkers.', 'SERS Immunosensors for Cancer Markers Detection.', 'Recent Trends in SERS-Based Plasmonic Sensors for Disease Diagnostics, Biomolecules Detection, and Machine Learning Techniques.', 'Specific capture and determination of glycoprotein using a\xa0hybrid epitopes and monomers-mediated molecular-imprinted polymer enzyme-free electrochemical biosensor.', 'A Review of Magnetic Nanoparticle-Based Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering Substrates for Bioanalysis: Morphology, Function and Detection Application.', 'Biosensors and Drug Delivery in Oncotheranostics Using Inorganic Synthetic and Biogenic Magnetic Nanoparticles.']"""

We hypothesized that AR activity within the tumor has clinical implications and investigated whether androgen responsive serum factors might serve as a minimally invasive indicator of tumor AR activity.  Methods:   Based on a comprehensive gene expression analysis of an AR-positive, triple negative breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model, 163 dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-responsive genes were defined as an androgen responsive gene set. Among them, we focused on genes that were DHT-responsive that encode secreted proteins, namely KLK3, AZGP1 and PIP, that encode the secreted factors prostate specific antigen (PSA), zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein (ZAG) and prolactin induced protein (PIP), respectively. Using AR-positive breast cancer cell lines representing all breast cancer subtypes, expression of candidate factors was assessed in response to agonist DHT and antagonist enzalutamide. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed on publically available gene expression datasets from breast cancer patients to analyze the relationship between genes encoding the secreted factors and other androgen responsive gene sets in each breast cancer subtype.  Results:   Anti-androgen treatment decreased proliferation in all cell lines tested representing various tumor subtypes. Expression of the secreted factors was regulated by AR activation in the majority of breast cancer cell lines. In GSEA, the candidate genes were positively correlated with an androgen responsive gene set across breast cancer subtypes.  Conclusion:   KLK3, AZGP1 and PIP are AR regulated and reflect tumor AR activity. Further investigations are needed to examine the potential efficacy of these factors as serum biomarkers.""","""['Toru Hanamura', 'Jessica L Christenson', ""Kathleen I O'Neill"", 'Emmanuel Rosas', 'Nicole S Spoelstra', 'Michelle M Williams', 'Jennifer K Richer']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Breast Cancer Res""","""['Functional characterization of androgen receptor in two patient-derived xenograft models of triple negative breast cancer.', 'Lupeol, a novel androgen receptor inhibitor: implications in prostate cancer therapy.', 'A competitive inhibitor that reduces recruitment of androgen receptor to androgen-responsive genes.', 'Complexities of androgen receptor signalling in breast cancer.', 'Adaptation to Hypoxia May Promote Therapeutic Resistance to Androgen Receptor Inhibition in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.', 'Anti-Androgenic Therapies Targeting the Luminal Androgen Receptor of a Typical Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.', 'Adrenal Steroids and Resistance to Hormonal Blockade of Prostate and Breast Cancer.']"""

This study investigates factors associated with GP contact during follow-up of prostate cancer survivors, such as patient, treatment and symptom variables, and satisfaction with, trust in, and appraised knowledge of GPs.  Methods:   Of 787 prostate cancer survivors diagnosed between 2007 and 2013, and selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry, 557 (71%) responded to the invitation to complete a questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate which variables were associated with GP contact during follow- up.  Results:   In total, 200 (42%) prostate cancer survivors had contact with their GP during follow-up, and 76 (16%) survivors preferred more contact. Survivors who had an intermediate versus low educational level (OR = 2.0) were more likely to have had contact with their GP during follow-up.

This AI agent achieved clinically comparable quality for prostate cases, but its performance on head-and-neck patients leaves room for improvement. This study aims to collect insights of the deep-learning-based (DL-based) fluence map prediction model by systematically analyzing its prediction errors.Methods.From the modeling perspective, the DL model's output is the fluence maps of IMRT plans. However, from the clinical planning perspective, the plan quality evaluation should be based on the clinical dosimetric criteria such as dose-volume histograms. To account for the complex and non-intuitive relationships between fluence map prediction errors and the corresponding dose distribution changes, we propose a novel error analysis approach that systematically examines plan dosimetric changes that are induced by varying amounts of fluence prediction errors. We investigated four decomposition modes of model prediction errors. The two spatial domain decompositions are based on fluence intensity and fluence gradient. The two frequency domain decompositions are based on Fourier-space banded frequency rings and Fourier-space truncated low-frequency disks. The decomposed error was analyzed for its impact on the resulting plans' dosimetric metrics. The analysis was conducted on 15 test cases spared from the 200 training and 16 validation cases used to train the model.Results.Most planning target volume metrics were significantly correlated with most error decompositions. The Fourier space disk radii had the largest Spearman's coefficients. The low-frequency region within a disk of ∼20% Fourier space contained most of errors that impact overall plan quality.Conclusions.This study demonstrates the feasibility of using fluence map prediction error analysis to understand the AI agent's performance.

Thus, patient-reported quality of life (QOL) data may guide treatment choices.  Methods:   A group of patients within the STAMPEDE trial were contemporaneously enrolled with the possibility of being randomly allocated to receive either docetaxel + SOC or AAP + SOC. A mixed-model assessed QOL in those who had completed at least one QLQ-C30 + PR25 questionnaire. The primary outcome measure was difference in global-QOL (QLQ-C30 Q29&30) between patients allocated to docetaxel + SOC or AAP + SOC over the 2 years after random assignment, with a predefined criterion for clinically meaningful difference of > 4.0 points. Secondary outcome measures included longitudinal comparison of functional domains, pain, and fatigue, plus global-QOL at defined timepoints.  Results:   Five hundred fifteen patients (173 docetaxel + SOC and 342 AAP + SOC) were included. Baseline characteristics, proportion of missing data, and mean baseline global-QOL scores (docetaxel + SOC 77.8 and AAP + SOC 78.0) were similar. Over the 2 years following random assignment, the mean modeled global-QOL score was +3.9 points (95% CI, +0.5 to +7.2; P = .022) higher in patients allocated to AAP + SOC.

There is evidence of high variability in treatment protocols among different centers worldwide, and no international consensus guidelines on treatment volumes, radiation schedules, and techniques. The purpose of the present retrospective study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of involved-pelvic-node stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for oligorPC.  Materials and methods:   Patients with pelvic node oligorPC following primary surgery, radical radiotherapy, or salvage radiotherapy for biochemical or local relapse of prostate cancer who underwent involved-node SBRT with biological effective dose (BED) > 100 Gy, with or without concurrent and adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), were retrospectively evaluated. Biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS), distant progression-free survival (DPFS), overall survival (OS), possible prognostic factors, and toxicity outcomes were investigated.  Results:   From November 2012 to December 2019, 74 patients fitted the selection criteria. A total of 117 lesions were treated. Median follow-up was 31 months (range 6-89). Concurrent ADT was administered in 58.1% of patients. The 1‑year, 2‑year, and 3‑year DPFS was 77%, 37%, and 19%, respectively; the 1‑year, 2‑year, and 3‑year OS was 98%, 98%, and 95%, respectively. The presence of a single target lesion was associated with a statistically significant impact on OS. No in-field recurrence occurred. Patients who reached early prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir (< 3 months after SBRT) had a lower 3‑year survival (p = 0.004). The value of PSA nadir after SBRT and the time between primary treatment and SBRT had an impact on bPFS. Concomitant ADT was associated with improved DPFS. No acute or early late (> 6 months) genitourinary and gastrointestinal adverse events of any grade were reported, albeit with relatively short median follow-up.  Conclusion:   SBRT is a safe and effective treatment for oligorPC, with a 100% local control rate in our series. It is not possible to clearly assess the opportunity to postpone ADT prescription in patients with two or more nodal metastases. The number of secondary lesions, time-to-nadir PSA, PSA nadir value, and the time interval between primary treatment and SBRT were identified as prognostic factors.

Methods:   Data were analyzed from 1364 patients with BC and 1161 patients with CRPC who had BMs and were receiving anti-cancer therapy in hospitals across six European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK). The 731 physicians (medical oncologists or urologists) provided insights in the decision-making factors driving their management of bone health for these patients, and the patient medical records indicated how these decisions were reflected in routine clinical practice.  Results:   Within three months of a BM diagnosis, 74% of BC and 51% of CRPC patients had initiated treatment with a BTA. Around 12% of BC and 23% of CRPC patients did not receive a BTA following BM diagnosis. Irrespective of the tumour type (BC or CRPC), most physicians prescribed either denosumab or zoledronic acid as first BTA therapy. Physicians reported bone pain as a major decision-making factor to initiate a BTA. The presence of bone complications at BM diagnosis and bone pain at BM diagnosis were found to be significant predictive factors for a BTA initiation, irrespective of tumour type.  Conclusions:   Despite European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidance on bone protection irrespective of symptomatic disease, not all patients with BMs received a BTA following a BM diagnosis.

The nanocatalyst described was prepared via hydrothermal synthesis route, followed by calcination at 800 °C. Field emission scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction were applied to obtain information about the material morphology and structure. A carbon paste electrode modified with nano-NiMn2O4 showed unique catalytic activity in sarcosine electroxidation which led to a significant rise in oxidation current (about four times) in comparison with the blank electrode. However, the carbon paste electrodes containing single oxides of NiO and Mn2O3 exhibited no considerable enhancement in sarcosine signal. The cyclic voltammetry results indicated that the Mn3+/Mn4+ couple was responsible for sarcosine oxidation, and NiO may enhance the content of Mn4+species in NiMn2O4 material. The carbon paste-based NiMn2O4 electrode was applied in the sensitive determination of sarcosine in the concentration range of 0.01-5.0 μM with the relative standard deviation of 3.49% (n = 5). The detection limit and quantification limit of the probe were determined to be 3.8 and 12 nM, respectively.

To quantify PCA3, a pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid (acpcPNA) was immobilized onto the aldehyde-modified oPAD surface as a selective capture probe. A G-quadruplex (GQD) DNAzyme reporter probe was designed so that the PCA3 gene target binding triggered the hybridization chain reaction of the reporter probe, resulting in the accumulation of the GQD on the oPAD. The peroxidase activity of the GQD-hemin generated a deep green color of the oxidized ABTS substrate. Image analyses were performed in Adobe Photoshop CS6. The proposed oPAD was successfully applied in PCA3 detection ranges of 1-5 μM (r2 = 0.982) with a limit of detection of 0.5 μM.

Interleukin-23 (IL-23) was reported to play a significant role in prostate cancer. Here, we aimed to explore the clinical value of IL-23-secreting (IL-23+) cells in prostate cancer patients. We evaluated interleukin-23A (IL-23A) expression in The Cancer Genome Atlas database and retrospectively enrolled 179 treatment-naïve metastatic prostate cancer patients diagnosed in our institute between June 2012 and December 2014. IL-23+ cells were stained and evaluated via immunohistochemistry. Further, survival and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to explore the prognostic value of IL-23+ cells. We found that IL-23A expression correlated with disease progression, while IL-23+ cells were clearly stained within prostate cancer tissue. Patients with higher Gleason scores and multiple metastatic lesions tended to have more IL-23+ cell infiltration. Further analyses showed that patients with higher levels of IL-23+ cells had significantly worse overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.996, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.812-4.955; P = 0.001) and a higher risk of developing castration resistance (HR = 2.725, 95% CI: 1.865-3.981; P = 0.001). Moreover, subgroup analyses showed that when patients progressed to a castration-resistant status, the prognostic value of IL-23+ cells was observed only in patients treated with abiraterone instead of docetaxel. Therefore, we showed that high IL-23+ cell infiltration is an independent prognosticator in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.

TPTPB are traditionally performed under general anaesthetic. However, this poses a significant strain on hospital theatre capacity. As such, local anaesthetic (LA) TPTPB are becoming more popular. We describe a novel technique in performing the standard TPTPB under LA in the outpatient setting.  Materials and methods:   Between February 2019- February 2021, 254 consecutive men (median age 69; range: 44-80 years) with a median PSA of 8.7 ng/ml (range: 2.2-76) underwent L/A TPTPB using our novel technique. This is whereby 50mls of 1% prilocaine was injected partially around the perineal skin and partially deep bilateral periprostatic areas. Multiple simultaneous prostate biopsies were then taken with the standard template grid and stepper.  Results:   A total of 250/254 (98.4%) men underwent successful L/A TPTPB with a median visual analogue pain score of 4 (range: 2-8). The median prostate volume was 49cc (range: 14-240cc).

In populations of European ancestry, these variants are mostly present at relatively high frequencies. To gain insight into evolutionary origins, we screened a series of genes and SNPs linked to breast or prostate cancer for signatures of historical positive selection.  Methodology:   We took advantage of the availability of the 1000 genome data and we performed genomic scans for positive selection in five different Caucasian populations as well as one African reference population. We then used prostate organoid cultures to provide a possible functional explanation for the interplay between the action of evolutionary forces and the disease risk association.  Results:   Variants in only one gene showed genomic signatures of positive, evolutionary selection within Caucasian populations melanophilin (MLPH). Functional depletion of MLPH in prostate organoids, by CRISPR/Cas9 mutation, impacted lineage commitment of progenitor cells promoting luminal versus basal cell differentiation and on resistance to androgen deprivation.  Conclusions and implications:   The MLPH variants influencing prostate cancer risk may have been historically selected for their adaptive benefit on skin pigmentation but MLPH is highly expressed in the prostate and the derivative, positively selected, alleles decrease the risk of prostate cancer. Our study suggests a potential functional mechanism via which MLPH and its genetic variants could influence risk of prostate cancer, as a serendipitous consequence of prior evolutionary benefits to another tissue.  Lay summary:   We screened a limited series of genomic variants associated with breast and prostate cancer risk for signatures of historical positive selection. Variants within the melanophilin (MLPH) gene fell into this category.

However, little is known about ISL1 expression in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). ISL1 has also been recognized as a positive modulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In this study, we focused on ISL1 which showed maximum upregulation at the mRNA level in the enzalutamide-resistant cell line. Accordingly, we found that ISL1 was overexpressed in enzalutamide-resistant C4-2B cells and its expression was significantly related to EMT. Our findings reveal the important role of ISL1 in androgen receptor (AR)-dependent prostate cancer cell growth; ISL1 knockdown reduced the AR activity and cell growth. ISL1 knockdown using small-interfering RNA inhibited AR, PSA, and EMT-related protein expression in C4-2B ENZR cells. In addition, knock-down ISL1 reduced the levels of AKT and p65 phosphorylation in C4-2B ENZR cells and these suggest that knock-down ISL1 suppresses EMT in part by targeting the AKT/NF-κB pathway. Further, ISL1 downregulation could effectively inhibit tumor growth in a human CRPC xenograft model. Together, the present study shows that downregulation of ISL1 expression is necessary for overcoming enzalutamide resistance and improving the survival of CRPC patients.""","""['Jae Duck Choi', 'Tae Jin Kim', 'Byong Chang Jeong', 'Hwang Gyun Jeon', 'Seong Soo Jeon', 'Min Yong Kang', 'Seon Yong Yeom', 'Seong Il Seo']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Histone acetyltransferase 1 upregulates androgen receptor expression to modulate CRPC cell resistance to enzalutamide.', 'SPP1 Promotes Enzalutamide Resistance and Epithelial-Mesenchymal-Transition Activation in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer via PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 Pathways.', 'CDK6 is upregulated and may be a potential therapeutic target in enzalutamide-resistant castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Understanding the mechanisms of androgen deprivation resistance in prostate cancer at the molecular level.', 'Enzalutamide: a novel anti-androgen with prolonged survival rate in CRPC patients.', 'Emergent dynamics of underlying regulatory network links EMT and androgen receptor-dependent resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Identification of Diagnostic Markers in Infantile Hemangiomas.', 'Tumor cell-derived exosomal lncRNA LOC441178 inhibits the tumorigenesis of esophageal carcinoma through suppressing macrophage M2 polarization.']"""

Multiplex immunofluorescence indicated that the HER3 ligand NRG1 is detectable primarily in tumor-infiltrating myelomonocytic cells in human prostate cancer; this observation was confirmed using single-cell RNA sequencing of human prostate cancer biopsies and murine transgenic prostate cancer models. In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patient-derived xenograft organoids with high HER3 expression as well as mouse prostate cancer organoids, recombinant NRG1 enhanced proliferation and survival. Supernatant from murine bone marrow-derived macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells promoted murine prostate cancer organoid growth in vitro, which could be reversed by a neutralizing anti-NRG1 antibody and ERBB inhibition. Targeting HER3, especially with the HER3-directed antibody-drug conjugate U3-1402, exhibited antitumor activity against HER3-expressing prostate cancer. Overall, these data indicate that HER3 is commonly overexpressed in lethal prostate cancer and can be activated by NRG1 secreted by myelomonocytic cells in the tumor microenvironment, supporting HER3-targeted therapeutic strategies for treating HER3-expressing advanced CRPC.

Based on this designing, immunoassay for PSA was effectively connected with the dynamic behavior of methylene blue molecules through the cleavage of DNAzyme on MOFs surface and performed a wide linear range from 1 pg mL-1 to 10 ng mL-1 and a satisfactory detection limit with 0.34 pg mL-1.

Here we propose a novel methodology that can be used for systematically defining contextual features regarding prostate glands. This is done by defining a Gland Context Network (GCN), a representation of the prostate sample containing information about the spatial relationship between glands as well as the similarity between their appearance. We show that such a network can be used for establishing contextual features at any spatial scale, therefore providing information that is not easily obtained from traditional shape and textural features. Furthermore, it is shown that even basic features derived from a GCN can lead to state-of-the-art classification performance regarding PCa.

Results.—:   Tumor grade was significantly higher in Bil-SVI cases than in Uni-SVI cases. Additionally, Bil-SVI was significantly associated with a higher incidence of lymphovascular invasion, lymph node metastasis, or positive surgical margin, and larger estimated tumor volume. When the histopathologic features at SVI foci were compared, Grade Group (GG) 3-5/4-5/5 and cribriform morphology were significantly more often seen in Bil-SVI. Outcome analysis revealed that patients with Bil-SVI had a significantly higher risk of disease progression (P < .001) than patients with Uni-SVI. Significantly worse progression-free survival in patients with Bil-SVI was also observed in all subgroups examined, including those with no immediate adjuvant therapy (IAT) (n = 139; P = .01), IAT (n = 109; P = .001), pN0 disease (n = 153; P = .002), or pN1 disease (n = 93; P = .006).

Conclusions.—:   Bil-SVI was found to be strongly associated with worse histopathologic features on radical prostatectomy and poorer prognosis.

[89Zr]DFB(25) NPs and [89Zr]DFB(25)ACUPA(75) NPs were injected to mice with bilateral PSMA(-) PC3-Flu and PSMA(+) PC3-Pip dual xenografts. The NPs demonstrated twofold superior accumulation in PC3-Pip tumors to that of PC3-Flu tumors with a tumor/blood ratio of 25; however, no substantial effect of the ACUPA ligands was detected. Moreover, fast release of carborane from the NPs was observed, resulting in a low boron delivery to tumors in vivo. In summary, these data demonstrate the synthesis, characterization, and initial biological assessment of PSMA-targeted, carborane-loaded PLGA-b-PEG nanoparticles and establish the foundation for future efforts to enable their best use in vivo.""","""['Niranjan Meher', 'Kyounghee Seo', 'Sinan Wang', 'Anil P Bidkar', 'Miko Fogarty', 'Suchi Dhrona', 'Xiao Huang', 'Ryan Tang', 'Charles Blaha', 'Michael J Evans', 'David R Raleigh', 'Young-Wook Jun', 'Henry F VanBrocklin', 'Tejal A Desai', 'David M Wilson', 'Tomoko Ozawa', 'Robert R Flavell']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""ACS Appl Mater Interfaces""","""['Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Targeted Deep Tumor Penetration of Polymer Nanocarriers.', 'Synthesis and Initial Biological Evaluation of Boron-Containing Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Ligands for Treatment of Prostate Cancer Using Boron Neutron Capture Therapy.', 'PEG-PLA nanoparticles decorated with small-molecule PSMA ligand for targeted delivery of galbanic acid and docetaxel to prostate cancer cells.', 'Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) ligands for diagnosis and therapy of prostate cancer.', 'PSMA Theranostics: Current Status and Future Directions.', 'PSMA-Targeted Nanotheranostics for Imaging and Radiotherapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Boron Vehiculating Nanosystems for Neutron Capture Therapy in Cancer Treatment.', 'Fluorescent Multifunctional Organic Nanoparticles for Drug Delivery and Bioimaging: A Tutorial Review.', 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Targeted Deep Tumor Penetration of Polymer Nanocarriers.', 'Enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of nanoparticles for cancer treatment using versatile targeted strategies.']"""

Purpose To validate prostate tissue composition measured by using HM MRI, with quantitative histologic evaluation from whole-mount prostatectomy as the reference standard. Materials and Methods In this HIPAA-compliant study, from December 2016 to July 2018, prospective participants with biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer underwent 3-T MRI before radical prostatectomy. Axial HM MRI was performed with all combinations of echo times (57, 70, 150, and 200 msec) and b values (0, 150, 750, and 1500 sec/mm2). Data were fitted by using a three-compartment signal model to generate volumes for each tissue component (stroma, epithelium, lumen). Quantitative histologic evaluation was performed to calculate volume fractions for each tissue component for regions of interest corresponding to MRI. Tissue composition measured by using HM MRI and quantitative histologic evaluation were compared (paired t test) and correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient), and agreement (concordance correlation) was assessed. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for cancer diagnosis was performed. Results Twenty-five participants (mean age, 60 years ± 7 [standard deviation]; 30 cancers and 45 benign regions of interest) were included. Prostate tissue composition measured with HM MRI and quantitative histologic evaluation did not differ (stroma, 45% ± 11 vs 44% ± 11 [P = .23]; epithelium, 31% ± 15 vs 34% ± 15 [P = .08]; and lumen, 24% ± 13 vs 22% ± 11 [P = .80]). Between HM MRI and histologic evaluation, there was excellent correlation (Pearson r: overall, 0.91; stroma, 0.82; epithelium, 0.93; lumen, 0.90 [all P < .05]) and agreement (concordance correlation coefficient: overall, 0.91; stroma, 0.81; epithelium, 0.90; and lumen, 0.87). High areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve obtained with HM MRI (0.96 for epithelium and 0.94 for lumen, P < .001) and histologic evaluation (0.94 for epithelium and 0.88 for lumen, P < .001) were found for differentiation between benign tissue and prostate cancer. Conclusion Tissue composition measured by using hybrid multidimensional MRI had excellent correlation with quantitative histologic evaluation as the reference standard. © RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

Identifying culturally specific coping strategies that lower distress among Black PCaP could help improve psychological interventions for this group. African-centered coping (strategies unique to the structure of Black personality and the African-centered worldview) have been identified. We hypothesized that these coping strategies and resilience would be associated with lower psychological distress (anxiety and depression) in Black PCaP.  Methods:   Black PCaP (N = 95) completed a survey assessing African-centered coping strategies, resilience, anxiety, and depression. Multiple regression was employed to examine African-centered coping strategies and resilience as predictors of psychological distress.  Results:   Participants were aged M = 67 ± 9 years and 52% had late-stage PCa. Twenty percent met criteria for clinically significant anxiety, and 17% for depression. African-centered coping strategies were not associated with lower anxiety or depression, while resilience was associated with decreased anxiety (r = -0.45, p < 0.001) and depression (r = -0.54, p < 0.001). Mediation analyses did not support an indirect association among African-centered coping strategies, resilience, and anxiety and depression.  Conclusions:   Contrary to hypotheses, African-centered coping strategies were not associated with psychological distress. However, as predicted, greater resilience was associated with lower anxiety and depression. These findings support the relevancy of resilience in Blacks' psychological adjustment to PCa. It might be worthwhile to explore African-centered coping strategies that help Black PCaP cope with distress.""","""['Chloé M Martin', 'Elizabeth Schofield', 'Stephanie Napolitano', 'Isabelle K Avildsen', 'Jessica C Emanu', 'Rebecca Tutino', 'Andrew J Roth', 'Christian J Nelson']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Psychooncology""","""['Resilience in Long-Term Cancer Survivors - Associations with Psychological Distress and Sociodemographic Characteristics.', 'Psychological distress associated with COVID-19 quarantine: Latent profile analysis, outcome prediction and mediation analysis.', 'Distress, anxiety, depression, and emotional well-being in African-American men with prostate cancer.', 'Strategies to promote coping and resilience in oncology and palliative care nurses caring for adult patients with malignancy: a comprehensive systematic review.', 'Understanding and managing psychological distress due to climate change.', 'African American Males Have More Distress During Cancer Treatment Than White Males.']"""

BMI, diet, and physical activity were of particular interest as potential determinants.  Methods:   Participants who completed the 'Health and Lifestyle after Cancer' survey were adults who had been diagnosed with breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer (mean time since cancer diagnosis was 35.5 months, SD=13.56). Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. BMI was calculated from self-reported height and weight. Participants were categorised as meeting/not meeting the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) recommendations for fibre, fruit and vegetables, added sugar, red meat, processed meat, fat, alcohol, and physical activity. Analyses accounted for demographic and clinical factors.  Results:   Fifty-seven percent of those with sleep data were classified as poor sleepers (response rate 79%). Being female, having a higher number of cancer treatments, more comorbid conditions, and being more anxious/depressed increased the odds of being a poor sleeper. After adjustment for these factors, there were no associations between diet/alcohol/physical activity and sleep. However, BMI was associated with sleep. Individuals in the overweight and obese categories had 22% and 79% higher odds of being poor sleepers than individuals in the underweight/healthy weight category, respectively.  Conclusions:   The findings suggest that there may be a need to develop sleep quality interventions for cancer survivors with obesity. Even after adjustment for multiple clinical and demographic factors, BMI (particularly obesity) was associated with poor sleep. Thus, researchers and health professionals should find ways to support individuals with overweight and obesity to improve their sleep quality.  Implications for cancer survivors:   The present findings highlight that poor sleep is a common issue in cancer survivors.

In recent years, there has been increasing use of α-emitters in theranostic agents with both small- and large-molecule constructs. The proper precautionary means for their use and surveying documentation of these isotopes in a clinical setting are an essential accompaniment to these treatments. Methods: Patient treatment data collected over a 3-y period, as well as regulatory requirements and safety practices, are described. Commonly used radiation instruments were evaluated for their ability to identify potential radioactive material spills and contamination events during a clinical administration of 225Ac. These instruments were placed at 0.32 cm from a 1.0-cm 225Ac disk source for measurement purposes. Radiation background values, efficiencies, and minimal detectable activities were measured and calculated for each type of detector. Results: The median external measured dose rate from 223RaCl2 patients (n = 611) was 2.5 μSv h-1 on contact and 0.2 μSv h-1 at 1 m immediately after administration. Similarly, 225Ac-lintuzumab (n = 19) patients had median external dose rates of 2.0 μSv h-1 on contact and 0.3 μSv h-1 at 1 m. For the measurement of 225Ac samples, a liquid scintillation counter was found to have the highest overall efficiency (97%), whereas a ZnS α-probe offered the lowest minimal detectable activity at 3 counts per minute. Conclusion: In this article, we report data from 630 patients who were undergoing treatment with the α-emitting isotopes 223Ra and 225Ac. Although α-emitters have the ability to deliver a higher internal radiation dose to the exposed tissues than can other unsealed radionuclides, they typically present minimal concerns about external dose rate. Additionally, α-radiation can be efficiently detected with appropriate radiation instrumentation, such as a liquid scintillation counter or ZnS probe, which should be prioritized when surveying for spills of α-emitters.""","""['Brian Serencsits', 'Bae P Chu', 'Neeta Pandit-Taskar', 'Michael R McDevitt', 'Lawrence T Dauer']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Nucl Med Technol""","""[""Meckel's Diverticulum Imaging."", 'SNMMI Clinical Trials Network Research Series for Technologists: Clinical Research Primer-Regulatory Process, Part I: How and When Radiopharmaceuticals Can Be Used.', 'Comparison of Low-Energy and Medium-Energy Collimators for Thyroid Scintigraphy with 123I.', 'PET/MRI, Part 3: Protocols and Procedures.', 'Quantitative comparisons of cancer induction in humans by internally deposited radionuclides and external radiation.', 'Radiation safety considerations for the use of radium-224-calciumcarbonate-microparticles in patients with peritoneal metastasis.']"""

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 64 biopsy naïve patients from 3 different referral centers between 2018 and 2020 with a PSA<10, cT1c disease, a single PI-RADS≥ 3 index lesion in multiparametric-MRI (mp-MRI), all bearing a GG 1 tumor sampled software fusion biopsy, who underwent RP. Preoperative clinical variables including the localization, number and tumor burden of positive cores for each PI-RADS category were related to upgrading and adverse pathology (GG>2 and/or pT3 and/or lymph node positive disease) at RP.  Results:   Overall 37 patients (57.8%) were upgraded with a significant difference of upgrading in PI-RADS3 (30.0%) versus PI-RADS 4 (67.6%) (P = .007) and PI-RADS 4-5 (70.5%) lesions (P = .002). Thirty-three of 37 GG1 tumors were upgraded to GG2, while 6 of these 33 (18.2%) had adverse pathology as well. Overall 9 patients (14.1%) had adverse pathology at RP all harboring PI-RADS4-5 lesions. The number of positive cores differed significantly between the upgraded and nonupgraded patients. Adverse pathology group had significantly higher tumor volume at RP.  Conclusion:   PI-RADS4-5 lesions are the independent predictors of upgrading and adverse pathology in low risk PCa with visible tumors.

However, infections are one of the biopsy-associated complications, and post-biopsy fever is estimated to occur in approximately 1% of all cases. It may thus be beneficial to perform a rectal swab culture before a transrectal prostate biopsy to confirm the presence of resistant bacteria and select preventive antibacterial agents according to the drug susceptibility results. This study aimed to determine whether there is a difference between the drug susceptibility of bacteria detected in the stool of patients who were scheduled to undergo prostate biopsy and the hospital-wide urine antibiogram. Patients suspected of having prostate cancer who underwent transrectal prostate biopsy via transrectal ultrasonography between August 1, 2016, and June 30, 2020, were included in this study.

Escherichia coli was detected in 74.0% (60 samples) of the stool culture samples, of which 4 samples were extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing types. We found greater susceptibility of Escherichia coli to ampicillin, fluoroquinolones, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and cefixime in the stool culture antibiogram than in the hospital-wide urine antibiogram. We also found a significantly low incidence of ESBL-positive Escherichia coli in the stool culture antibiogram with p-values of 0.009, 0.007, and 0.03 compared to the hospital-wide urine antibiograms for 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively.

Targeting the AR therefore remains the cornerstone for mPCa treatment. We have previously reported that activation of AR signalling affects taxane chemo-sensitivity in preclinical models of castration resistant PCa (CRPC). Here, we explored the anti-tumour efficacy of the AR targeted inhibitor enzalutamide combined with cabazitaxel.  Methods:   We used the AR positive CRPC model PC346C-DCC-K to assess the in vitro and in vivo activity of combining enzalutamide with cabazitaxel. Subsequent validation studies were performed using an enzalutamide resistant VCaP model. To investigate the impact of AR signalling on cabazitaxel activity we used quantitative live-cell imaging of tubulin stabilization and apoptosis related nuclear fragmentation.  Findings:   Enzalutamide strongly amplified cabazitaxel anti-tumour activity in the patient-derived xenograft models PC346C-DCC-K (median time to humane endpoint 77 versus 48 days, P<0.0001) and VCaP-Enza-B (median time to humane endpoint 80 versus 53 days, P<0.001). Although enzalutamide treatment by itself was ineffective in reducing tumour growth, it significantly suppressed AR signalling in PC346C-DCC-K tumours as shown by AR target gene expression.

Methods:   In this single center cohort study, consecutive patients with histologically confirmed PCA were retrospectively enrolled. Four different ISUP grade groups (1, 2, 3, 4-5) were defined and fifty patients per group were included. Several clinical (age, PSA, PSAD, percentage of PCA infiltration) and mpMRI parameters (ADC value, signal increase on high b-value images, diameter, extraprostatic extension [EPE], cross-zonal growth) were evaluated and correlated within the four groups. Based on combined descriptors, MRI grading groups (mG1-mG3) were defined to predict PCA aggressiveness.  Results:   In total, 200 patients (mean age 68 years, median PSA value 8.1 ng/ml) were analyzed. Between the four groups, statistically significant differences could be shown for age, PSA, PSAD, and for MRI parameters cross-zonal growth, high b-value signal increase, EPE, and ADC (p < 0.01). All examined parameters revealed a significant correlation with the histopathologic biopsy ISUP grade groups (p < 0.01), except PCA diameter (p = 0.09). A mixed linear model demonstrated the strongest prediction of the respective ISUP grade group for the MRI grading system (p < 0.01) compared to single parameters.  Conclusions:   MpMRI yields relevant pre-biopsy information about PCA aggressiveness. A combination of quantitative and qualitative parameters (MRI grading groups) provided the best prediction of the biopsy ISUP grade group and may improve clinical pathway and treatment planning, adding useful information beyond PI-RADS assessment category. Due to the high prevalence of higher grade PCA in patients within mG3, an early re-biopsy seems indicated in cases of negative or post-biopsy low-grade PCA.  Key points:   • MpMRI yields relevant pre-biopsy information about prostate cancer aggressiveness. • MRI grading in addition to PI-RADS classification seems to be helpful for a size independent early prediction of clinically significant PCA. • MRI grading groups may help urologists in clinical pathway and treatment planning, especially when to consider an early re-biopsy.""","""['M Boschheidgen', 'L Schimmöller', 'C Arsov', 'F Ziayee', 'J Morawitz', 'B Valentin', 'K L Radke', 'M Giessing', 'I Esposito', 'P Albers', 'G Antoch', 'T Ullrich']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Repeat MRI during active surveillance: natural history of prostatic lesions and upgrading rates.', 'Prevalence of Prostate Cancer in PI-RADS Version 2.1 Transition Zone Atypical Nodules Upgraded by Abnormal DWI: Correlation With MRI-Directed TRUS-Guided Targeted Biopsy.', 'Prediction of High-grade Prostate Cancer Following Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Improving the Rotterdam European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer Risk Calculators.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'What Is the Negative Predictive Value of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Excluding Prostate Cancer at Biopsy?

To validate whether intratumoral (IT) tracer injection helps to increase identification of tumor-positive lymph nodes (LNs) better than intraprostatic (IP) tracer injection, a prospective randomized phase II trial was performed.  Methods:   PCa patients with a > 5% risk of lymphatic involvement were randomized between ultrasound-guided transrectal injection of indocyanine green-[99mTc]Tc-nanocolloid in 2 depots of 1 mL in the tumor (n = 55, IT-group) or in 4 depots of 0.5 mL in the peripheral zone of the prostate (n = 58, IP-group). Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT were used to define the location of the SLNs. SLNs were dissected using combination of radio- and fluorescence-guidance, followed by extended pelvic LN dissection and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. Outcome measurements were number of tumor-bearing SNs, tumor-bearing LNs, removed nodes, number of patients with nodal metastases, and metastasis-free survival (MFS) of 4-7-year follow-up data.  Results:   IT-injection did not result in significant difference of removed SLNs (5.0 vs 6.0, p = 0.317) and histologically positive SLNs (28 vs 22, p = 0.571). However, in IT-group, the SLN-positive nodes were 73.7% of total positive nodes compared to 37.3% in IP-group (p = 0.015). Moreover, significantly more node-positive patients were found in IT-group (42% vs 24%, p = 0.045), which did not result in worse MFS. In two patients (3.6%) from whom the IT-tracer injection only partly covered intraprostatic tumor spread, nodal metastases in ePLND without tumor-positive SNs were yielded.  Conclusions:   The percentage-positive SLNs found after IT-injection were significantly higher compared to IP-injection. Significantly more node-positive patients were found using IT-injection, which did not affect MFS. IT-injection failed to detect nodal metastases from non-index satellite lesions. Therefore, we suggest to combine IT- and IP-tracer injections in men with visible tumor on imaging.""","""['Esther M K Wit', 'Florian van Beurden', 'Gijs H Kleinjan', 'Nikolaos Grivas', 'Clarize M de Korne', 'Tessa Buckle', 'Maarten L Donswijk', 'Elise M Bekers', 'Fijs W B van Leeuwen', 'Henk G van der Poel']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['A hybrid radioactive and fluorescence approach is more than the sum of its parts; outcome of a phase II randomized sentinel node trial in prostate cancer patients.', 'Anatomical localization of radiocolloid tracer deposition affects outcome of sentinel node procedures in prostate cancer.', 'Relationship between intraprostatic tracer deposits and sentinel lymph node mapping in prostate cancer patients.', 'Advances in sentinel node dissection in prostate cancer from a technical perspective.', 'Current perspectives of sentinel lymph node dissection at the time of radical surgery for prostate cancer.', 'Exploring the Applications of Indocyanine Green in Robot-Assisted Urological Surgery: A Comprehensive Review of Fluorescence-Guided Techniques.', 'Sentinel Lymph Node Techniques in Urologic Oncology: Current Knowledge and Application.', 'A hybrid radioactive and fluorescence approach is more than the sum of its parts; outcome of a phase II randomized sentinel node trial in prostate cancer patients.', 'Non-invasive molecular imaging for precision diagnosis of metastatic lymph nodes: opportunities from preclinical to clinical applications.', 'Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Prostate Cancer Patients: Results From an Injection Technique Targeting the Index Lesion in the Prostate Gland.']"""

Design, setting, and participants:   This cross-sectional study identified US-based breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer studies incorporating precision oncology objectives for reporting of race and ethnicity. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results and US Census databases were used to determine cancer incidence by race and ethnicity, linked with cancer type and median year of enrollment for each trial. Data were collected and analyzed between December 2020 and April 2021.  Main outcomes and measures:   The expected number of participants per study by each racial and ethnic group was calculated based on the corresponding US-based proportion. Under- and overrepresentation was defined as the ratio of the actual number of enrolled cases to the expected number of cases for each trial by cancer type.

Various computer-aided detection algorithms were proposed for automated PCa detection by combining information in multiple mpMRI parameters. However, there are specific features of mpMRI, including between-voxel correlation within each prostate and heterogeneity across patients, that have not been fully explored but could potentially improve PCa detection if leveraged appropriately. This article proposes novel Bayesian approaches for voxel-wise PCa classification that accounts for spatial correlation and between-patient heterogeneity in the mpMRI data. Modeling the spatial correlation is challenging due to the extreme high dimensionality of the data, and we propose three scalable approaches based on Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Process (NNGP), reduced-rank approximation, and a conditional autoregressive (CAR) model that approximates a Gaussian Process with the Matérn covariance, respectively. Our simulation study shows that properly modeling the spatial correlation and between-patient heterogeneity can substantially improve PCa classification. Application to in vivo data illustrates that classification is improved by all three spatial modeling approaches considered, while modeling the between-patient heterogeneity does not further improve our classifiers. Among the proposed models, the NNGP-based model is recommended given its high classification accuracy and computational efficiency.""","""['Jin Jin', 'Lin Zhang', 'Ethan Leng', 'Gregory J Metzger', 'Joseph S Koopmeiners']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Stat Med""","""['Multi-resolution super learner for voxel-wise classification of prostate cancer using multi-parametric MRI.', 'Detection of prostate cancer with multiparametric MRI utilizing the anatomic structure of the prostate.', 'Comparing radiomic classifiers and classifier ensembles for detection of peripheral zone prostate tumors on T2-weighted MRI: a multi-site study.', 'Artificial Intelligence in Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: Where Do We Stand in 2021?', 'Emerging MR methods for improved diagnosis of prostate cancer by multiparametric MRI.', 'Multi-resolution super learner for voxel-wise classification of prostate cancer using multi-parametric MRI.']"""

Results:   Unemployed adults (2000-2018) were 4 times more likely to lack insurance than employed adults (41.4% vs 10.0%; P < .001). Unemployed adults had a significantly lower up-to-date prevalence of screening for cervical cancer (78.5% vs 86.2%; P < .001), breast cancer (67.8% vs 77.5%; P < .001), colorectal cancer (41.9 vs 48.5%; P < .001), and prostate cancer (25.4% vs 36.4%; P < .001). These differences were eliminated after accounting for health insurance coverage.  Conclusions:   Unemployment was adversely associated with up-to-date cancer screening, and this was fully explained by a lack of health insurance. Ensuring the continuation of health insurance coverage after job loss may mitigate the pandemic's economic distress and future economic downturns' impact on cancer screening.""","""['Stacey A Fedewa', 'K Robin Yabroff', 'Priti Bandi', 'Robert A Smith', 'Nigar Nargis', 'Zhiyuan Zheng', 'Jeffrey Drope', 'Ahmedin Jemal']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Comparison of Unemployment-Related Health Insurance Coverage Changes in Medicaid Expansion vs Nonexpansion States During the COVID-19 Pandemic.', 'Assessment of US Preventive Services Task Force Guideline-Concordant Cervical Cancer Screening Rates and Reasons for Underscreening by Age, Race and Ethnicity, Sexual Orientation, Rurality, and Insurance, 2005 to 2019.', 'Health and access to care among employed and unemployed adults: United States, 2009-2010.', 'Does a working day keep the doctor away?

DRAIC, a lncRNA that is downregulated in castration-resistant advanced prostate cancer, inhibits the NF-κB pathway by inhibiting the IκBα kinase. Decreased DRAIC expression predicted poor patient outcome in gliomas and seven other cancers. We now report that DRAIC suppresses invasion, migration, colony formation and xenograft growth of glioblastoma-derived cell lines. DRAIC activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by downregulating the NF-κB target gene GLUT1, and thus represses mTOR, leading to downstream effects, such as a decrease in protein translation and increase in autophagy. DRAIC, therefore, has an effect on multiple signal transduction pathways that are important for oncogenesis, namely, the NF-κB pathway and AMPK-mTOR-S6K/ULK1 pathway. The regulation of NF-κB, protein translation and autophagy by the same lncRNA explains the tumor-suppressive role of DRAIC in different cancers and reinforces the importance of lncRNAs as emerging regulators of signal transduction pathways.

However, the precise mechanism underlying the functions of Gαs signal in prostate cancer cells is still unclear. We have previously identified that GV1001, a fragment of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase, functions as a biased GnRHR ligand to selectively stimulate the Gαs/cAMP pathway. Here, we tried to reveal the potential mechanisms of which GV1001-stimulated Gαs-cAMP signaling pathway reduces the migration and metastasis of prostate cancer (PCa) cells.  Methods:   The expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes was measured by western-blotting and spheroid formation on ultra-low attachment plate was detected after GV1001 treatment. In vivo Spleen-liver metastasis mouse model was used to explore the inhibitory effect of GV1001 on metastatic ability of PCa and the transwell migration assay was performed to identify whether GV1001 had a suppressive effect on cell migration in vitro. In order to demonstrate the interaction between androgen receptor (AR) and YAP1, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), immunofluorescence (IF) staining, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) were performed in LNCaP cells with and without GV1001 treatment.  Results:   GV1001 inhibited expression of EMT-related genes and spheroid formation. GV1001 also suppressed in vivo spleen-liver metastasis of LNCaP cells as well as cell migration in vitro. GV1001 enhanced the phosphorylation of AR and transcription activity of androgen response element reporter gene through cAMP/protein kinase A pathway. Moreover, GV1001 increased Ser-127 phosphorylation of YAP1 and its ubiquitination, and subsequently decreased the levels of AR-YAP1 binding in the promoter region of the CTGF gene. In contrast, both protein and mRNA levels of NKX3.1 known for tumor suppressor gene and AR-coregulator were upregulated by GV1001 in LNCaP cells. YAP1 knockout using CRISPR/Cas9 significantly suppressed the migration ability of LNCaP cells, and GV1001 did not affect the cell migration of YAP1-deficient LNCaP cells. On the contrary, cell migration was more potentiated in LNCaP cells overexpressing YAP5SA, a constitutively active form of YAP1, which was not changed by GV1001 treatment.  Conclusions:   Overall, this study reveals an essential role of AR-YAP1 in the regulation of PCa cell migration, and provides evidence that GV1001 could be a novel GnRHR ligand to inhibit metastasis of PCa via the Gαs/cAMP pathway.""","""['Ji Won Kim', 'Miso Park', 'Suntae Kim', 'Sung Chul Lim', 'Hyung Shik Kim', 'Keon Wook Kang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cell Biosci""","""['Anti-cancer effect of GV1001 for prostate cancer: function as a ligand of GnRHR.', 'YAP1 Is Involved in Tumorigenic Properties of Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Changes in androgen receptor nongenotropic signaling correlate with transition of LNCaP cells to androgen independence.', 'Nimotuzumab inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer by targeting the Akt/YB-1/AR axis.', 'Cancer stem cell and mesenchymal cell cooperative actions in metastasis progression and hormone resistance in prostate cancer: Potential role of androgen and gonadotropin‑releasing hormone receptors (Review).', ""Let's Go 3D!

Materials and methods:   A total of 203 patients were prospectively enrolled at three institutions across Germany and Austria in the period from January 2019 to December 2019. During each biopsy, the urologist was blinded to the mpMRI report until after the micro-US targets had been assessed. After unblinding, targets were then sampled using software-assisted fusion, followed by systematic samples. The primary outcome measure was non-inferiority of micro-US to detect csPCa, with a detection ratio of at least 80% that of mpMRI.  Results:   A total of 79 csPCa cases were detected overall (39%). Micro-US-targeted biopsy detected 58/79 cases (73%), while mpMRI-targeted biopsy detected 60/79 (76%) and non-targeted (completion sampling) samples detected 45/79 cases (57%). mpMRI-targeted samples alone detected 7/79 (9%) csPCa cases which were missed by micro-US-targeted and non-targeted samples. Three of these seven were anterior lesions with 2/7 in the transition zone. Micro-US-targeted samples alone detected 5/79 (6%) and completion sampling alone detected 4/79 cases (5%). Micro-US was non-inferior to mpMRI and detected 97% of the csPCa cases detected by mpMRI-targeted biopsy (95% CI 80-116%; P = 0.023).  Conclusions:   This is the first multicentre prospective study comparing micro-US-targeted biopsy with mpMRI-targeted biopsy. The study provides further evidence that micro-US can reliably detect cancer lesions and suggests that micro-US biopsy might be as effective as mpMRI for detection of csPCA.

Results:   The findings suggest that Indo-Guyanese men are being screened for prostate cancer at a very low rate. Only 30% (n = 6) of participants underwent prostate cancer screening. Four major themes were derived from the data, which could have contributed to the decreased level of screening. These included: (1) recommendations must come from their healthcare professional; (2) reluctance to engage in screening; (3) distrust of the medical system; and (4) screening only if symptoms are present or they know someone with prostate cancer.

We aimed to assess the impact of surgical approach on post-operative outcomes and costs after RP by comparing open (ORP), laparoscopic (LRP), and robot-assisted (RARP) RP in the French healthcare system.  Patients and methods:   Data from all patients undergoing RP in France in 2020 were extracted from the central database of the national healthcare system. Primary endpoints were length of hospital stay (LOS including intensive care unit (ICU) stay if present), complications (estimated by severity index), hospital readmission rates (at 30 and 90 days), and direct costs of initial stay.  Results and limitations:   A total of 19,018 RPs were performed consisting in ORP in 21.1%, LRP in 27.6%, and RARP in 51.3% of cases. RARP was associated with higher center volume (p < 0.001), lower complication rates (p < 0.001), shorter LOS (p < 0.001), and lower readmission rates (p = 0.004). RARP was associated with reduced direct stay costs (2286 euros) compared with ORP (4298 euros) and LRP (3101 euros). The main cost driver was length of stay. The main limitations were the lack of mid-term data, readmission details, and cost variations due to surgery system.

There are currently limited data comparing the performance of these two radioligands with respect to clinical outcomes or their cost efficacy, which this study aims to address.  Methods:   Two hundred and forty-four patients undergoing PSMA PET/CT for rPC were retrospectively analysed for this study (one hundred and twenty two with each radiopharmaceutical) to generate rates of PET positivity, negativity and unclear findings. Patients underwent follow-up to determine the rate of additional examinations and to confirm PET findings. A Markov chain decision analysis was implemented to model clinical decision-making processes and to analyse clinical performance of the two tracers. We determine their clinical cost efficacies using cost data from several countries where both radiotracers are in routine use.  Results:   The PET positivity rate was non-significantly higher for [18F]PSMA-1007 compared to [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 (91.8% vs. 86.9%, p = 0.68), whereas the rate of uncertain findings was significantly greater (17.2% vs. 8.25%, p = 0.02). The probability of a true positive finding was higher for [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 (0.90, 95% CI 0.70-0.98) vs. [18F]PSMA-1007 (0.81, 95% CI 0.66-0.91). A significantly (p < 0.0001) higher PPV for [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 (0.99, 95% CI 0.99-1.0 vs. 0.86) was found compared to [18F]PSMA-1007 (0.86, 95% CI 0.82-1.00). Intervention efficacy analysis favoured [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11, where the number needed to image (to achieve a true positive finding) was 10.58 and the number needed to image to harm (to achieve a false positive finding) was - 8.08.

However, a systematic evaluation of image quality and diagnostic performance of MRI using short acquisition time with DLR has rarely been investigated in men with prostate cancer.  Purpose:   To assess the image quality and diagnostic performance of MRI using short acquisition time with DLR for the evaluation of extraprostatic extension (EPE).  Study type:   Retrospective.  Population:   One hundred and nine men.  Field strength/sequence:   3 T; turbo spin echo T2-weighted images (T2WI), echo-planar diffusion-weighted, and spoiled gradient echo dynamic contrast-enhanced images.  Assessment:   To compare image quality, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and subjective analysis using Likert scales on three T2WIs (MRI using conventional acquisition time, MRI using short acquisition time [fast MRI], and fast MRI with DLR) were performed. The diagnostic performance for EPE was evaluated by three independent readers.  Statistical tests:   SNR, CNR, and image quality scores across the three imaging protocols were compared using Friedman tests. The diagnostic performance for EPE was assessed using the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs). P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Results:   Fast MRI with DLR demonstrated significantly higher SNR (mean ± SD, 14.7 ± 6.8 vs. 8.8 ± 4.9) and CNR (mean ± SD, 6.5 ± 6.3 vs. 3.4 ± 3.6) values and higher image quality scores (median, 4.0 vs. 3.0 for three readers) than fast MRI. The AUCs for EPE were significantly higher with the use of DLR (0.86 vs. 0.75 for reader 2 and 0.82 vs. 0.73 for reader 3) compared with fast MRI, whereas differences were not significant for reader 1 (0.81 vs. 0.74; P = 0.09).

Thus, to mimic tumor-associated mutant p53, R273C-p53 and R273H-p53 isogenic PCa models were developed in the presence or absence of wild-type p53. In the absence of wild-type p53, both R273C-p53 and R273H-p53 exhibited similar loss of DNA binding, transcriptional profiles, and loss of canonical tumor suppressor functions associated with wild-type p53. In the presence of wild-type p53 expression, both R273C-p53 and R273H-p53 supported canonical p53 target gene expression yet elicited distinct cistromic and transcriptional profiles when compared to each other. Moreover, heterozygous modeling of R273C-p53 or R273H-p53 expression resulted in distinct phenotypic outcomes in vitro and in vivo. Thus, mutant p53 acts in a context-dependent manner to elicit pro-tumorigenic transcriptional profiles, providing critical insight into mutant p53-mediated prostate cancer progression.""","""['Jennifer J McCann#', 'Irina A Vasilevskaya#', 'Christopher McNair', 'Peter Gallagher', 'Neermala Poudel Neupane', 'Renée de Leeuw', 'Ayesha A Shafi', 'Emanuela Dylgjeri', 'Amy C Mandigo', 'Matthew J Schiewer', 'Karen E Knudsen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Mutants TP53 p.R273H and p.R273C but not p.R273G enhance cancer cell malignancy.', 'Inhibition of glucosylceramide synthase eliminates the oncogenic function of p53 R273H mutant in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and induced pluripotency of colon cancer cells.', 'Variable Mutations at the p53-R273 Oncogenic Hotspot Position Leads to Altered Properties.', 'Mutant p53 in colon cancer.', 'Transcriptional Regulation by Wild-Type and Cancer-Related Mutant Forms of p53.', 'Different impacts of TP53 mutations on cell cycle-related gene expression among cancer types.', 'Depletion of R270C Mutant p53 in Osteosarcoma Attenuates Cell Growth but Does Not Prevent Invasion and Metastasis In Vivo.', 'Targeting Mutant p53 for Cancer Treatment: Moving Closer to Clinical Use?', 'Modelling aggressive prostate cancers of young men in immune-competent mice, driven by isogenic Trp53 alterations and Pten loss.', 'Targeting MDM4 as a Novel Therapeutic Approach in Prostate Cancer Independent of p53 Status.']"""

Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 37 patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive PCa or metastatic castration-resistant PCa (mCRPC) who underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT at baseline and after the last cycle of taxane-based chemotherapy (docetaxel or cabazitaxel) without treatment modification between scans. Biochemical response (BR) was defined as an undetectable or at least 50% decreased level of prostate-specific antigen, compared with baseline. Associations between BR and different PET parameters were tested. A cutoff of at least a 30% decrease in PSMA total tumor volume (PSMA-TV) was used to define a PSMA response (PSMA-R) versus a PSMA nonresponse (PSMA-NR). Correlations between PSMA PET/CT response and BR were evaluated using the ϕ-coefficient. Associations between PET response and overall survival (OS) was tested using Cox regression and the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: Our cohort comprised 8 (22%) metastatic hormone-sensitive PCa and 29 (78%) mCRPC patients. Twenty-one patients received docetaxel treatment, and 16 received cabazitaxel (median, 6 cycles; interquartile range, 5-8 cycles). BR was found in 18 of 37 patients. Using PSMA total tumor volume, PSMA PET/CT response was concordant with BR in 35 of 37 patients (ϕ = 0.89, P < 0.0001). Eighteen of 37 patients had PSMA-R (6, complete response; 12, partial response), and 19 had PSMA-NR (17, progressive disease; 2, stable disease). After a median follow-up of 23 mo, there was a statistically significant longer OS for PSMA-R than for PSMA-NR (median OS not reached vs. 12 mo, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.03-0.39; P = 0.001) for the entire population. Among the mCRPC subgroup, differences in OS were also observed (median, 22 vs. 12 mo, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.06-0.82; P = 0.023), with a 12-mo OS rate of 100% for PSMA-R and 52% for PSMA-NR (P = 0.011). Conclusion: This retrospective analysis suggests that 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT is a promising imaging modality for assessing response to taxane-based chemotherapy in metastatic PCa.

We investigated the therapeutic enhancement of antiandrogens as radiosensitizers in combination with 18F-FDG in TNBC. Methods: We screened 5 candidate drugs to evaluate shared toxicity when combined with either 18F-FDG, x-rays, or ultraviolet radiation, at doses below their respective half-maximal inhibitory concentrations. Cytotoxic enhancement of antiandrogen in combination with 18F-FDG was evaluated using cell proliferation and DNA damage assays. Finally, the therapeutic efficacy of the combination treatment was evaluated in mouse tumor models of TNBC and prostate cancer. Results: Bicalutamide, an antiandrogen drug, was found to share similar toxicity in combination with either 18F-FDG or x-rays, indicating its sensitivity as a radiosensitizer to 18F-FDG. Cell proliferation assays demonstrated selective toxicity of combination bicalutamide-18F-FDG in AR-positive 22RV1 and MDA-MB-231 cells in comparison to AR-negative PC3 cells. Quantitative DNA damage and cell cycle arrest assays further confirmed radiation-induced damage to cells, suggesting the role of bicalutamide as a radiosensitizer to 18F-FDG-mediated radiation damage. Animal studies in MDA-MB-231, 22RV1, and PC3 mouse tumor models demonstrated significant attenuation of tumor growth through combination of bicalutamide and 18F-FDG in the AR-positive model in comparison to the AR-negative model. Histopathologic examination corroborated the in vitro and in vivo data and confirmed the absence of off-target toxicity to vital organs.

The objective of this study was to identify factors that clinicians consider when decreasing AS testing/converting to WW for men with prostate cancer.  Design:   Exploratory qualitative study.  Setting:   All participants practiced in various institutions in the USA.  Participants:   Eligible clinicians had to provide clinical care for patients with prostate cancer in the USA and speak English. Clinicians could be either urologists or radiation oncologists. Of the 24 clinicians, 83% were urologists representing 11 states, 92% were men and 62% were white.  Methods:   This qualitative study used data from semi-structured interviews. Purposive sampling was used to ensure geographical variation in the USA. Data collection continued until thematic saturation was achieved. Framework analysis guided coding and identification of themes. Two researchers coded all transcripts independently, met to discuss and reached consensus.  Results:   Interviews with clinicians demonstrated that testing or monitoring for AS or transitioning to WW is happening in practice, whether intentionally or unintentionally. Decisions to decrease AS were personalised and tailored to patients' health status. Life expectancy was the dominant factor that influenced decision, but clinicians were generally hesitant to specify an age when they would decrease AS or transition to WW. Fear that poor adherence could lead to missed progression and concerns about the medico-legal issue of not doing enough were cited as barriers to decreasing AS.  Conclusions:   These findings suggest that in certain situations, AS frequency is reduced or transitioned to WW, yet decisions appear to be inconsistent and there are no significant barriers.

Material and methods:   Thirty men with hormone naïve localized prostate carcinoma underwent ACE PET/CT for RT planning. There were five low-, 17 intermediate-, and eight high-risk patients. Based on thresholding of the standardized uptake values (SUVs) metabolic target volumes (MTVs) corresponding to intraprostatic lesions (IPLs) were contoured. Two planning target volumes (PTVs) were applied i.e., PTVlow-risk for the whole prostate with 8-10 mm margin and PTVhigh-risk for the MTV. Pelvic nodes were not irradiated. Late toxicity of biologically guided RT was reviewed after a median of 63 months and outcome after a median follow-up of 124 months.  Results:   Median doses to PTVlow-risk, PTVhigh-risk, prostate, and MTV were 72.9 Gy, 79.4 Gy, 76.6 Gy, and 80.4 Gy, respectively, in 38 fractions. The 10-year cancer-specific survival was 86% and the biochemical failure-free ratio 68%, respectively.

A larger MTV was associated with shorter PFS (r = -0.41, p = 0.02), but had no influence on OS. No other statistically significant differences in the dose painting parameters were observed between recurrence-free and recurring patients.

In contrast to most state-of-the-art network-based methods, GoNetic can leverage sample-specific mutational information and the weights of the underlying prior network. When applied to the HMF cohort, GoNetic successfully recovered known primary and metastatic drivers of prostate cancer that are frequently mutated in the HMF cohort (TP53, RB1, and CTNNB1). In addition, the identified subnetworks contain frequently mutated genes, reflect processes related to metastatic prostate cancer, and contain rarely mutated driver candidates. To further validate these rarely mutated genes, we assessed whether the identified genes were more mutated in metastatic than in primary samples using an independent cohort. Then we evaluated their association with tumor evolution and with the lymph node status of the patients.

To identify new therapeutic targets, we performed a detailed membrane-focused proteomic analysis of five human paraganglioma (PGL) samples. Using the Pitchfork strategy, which combines specific enrichments of glycopeptides, hydrophobic transmembrane segments, and non-glycosylated extra-membrane peptides, we identified over 1800 integral membrane proteins (IMPs). We found 45 ""tumor enriched"" proteins, i.e., proteins identified in all five PGLs but not found in control chromaffin tissue.

Using specific antibodies, we verified PSMA expression in 22 well-characterized human PPGL samples.

On the basis of the structure-activity relationships that we have explored, this study aims to incorporate carbamoyl groups to the alcoholic hydroxyl groups of silibinin to improve its capability in selectively suppressing AR-positive prostate cancer cell proliferation together with water solubility. To this end, a feasible approach was developed to regioselectively introduce a carbamoyl group to the secondary alcoholic hydroxyl group at C-3 without causing the undesired oxidation at C2-C3, providing an avenue for achieving 3-O-carbamoyl-5,7,20-O-trimethylsilybins. The application of the synthetic method can be extended to the synthesis of 3-O-carbamoyl-3',4',5,7-O-tetramethyltaxifolins. The antiproliferative potency of 5,7,20-O-trimethylsilybin and its nine 3-carbamoyl derivatives were assessed in an AR-positive LNCaP prostate cancer cell line and two AR-null prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3 and DU145). Our preliminary bioassay data imply that 5,7,20-O-trimethylsilybin and four 3-O-carbamoyl-5,7,20-O-trimethylsilybins emerge as very promising lead compounds due to the fact that they can selectively suppress AR-positive LNCaP cell proliferation. The IC50 values of these five 5,7,20-O-trimethylsilybins against the LNCaP cells fall into the range of 0.11-0.83 µM, which exhibit up to 660 times greater in vitro antiproliferative potency than silibinin.

It became a promising biological target in the diagnosis and therapy of PSMA-expressing cancer diseases. Although there are several radiolabeled PSMA inhibitors available, the search for new compounds with improved pharmacokinetic properties and simplified synthesis is still ongoing. In this study, we developed PSMA ligands with two different hybrid chelators and a modified linker. Both compounds have displayed a promising pharmacokinetic profile. (2) Methods: DATA5m.SA.KuE and AAZTA5.SA.KuE were synthesized. DATA5m.SA.KuE was labeled with gallium-68 and radiochemical yields of various amounts of precursor at different temperatures were determined. Complex stability in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and human serum (HS) was examined at 37 °C. Binding affinity and internalization ratio were determined in in vitro assays using PSMA-positive LNCaP cells. Tumor accumulation and biodistribution were evaluated in vivo and ex vivo using an LNCaP Balb/c nude mouse model. All experiments were conducted with PSMA-11 as reference. (3) Results: DATA5m.SA.KuE was synthesized successfully. AAZTA5.SA.KuE was synthesized and labeled according to the literature. Radiolabeling of DATA5m.SA.KuE with gallium-68 was performed in ammonium acetate buffer (1 M, pH 5.5). High radiochemical yields (>98%) were obtained with 5 nmol at 70 °C, 15 nmol at 50 °C, and 60 nmol (50 µg) at room temperature. [68Ga]Ga-DATA5m.SA.KuE was stable in human serum as well as in PBS after 120 min. PSMA binding affinities of AAZTA5.SA.KuE and DATA5m.SA.KuE were in the nanomolar range.

Our objective is to identify the knowledge and skills needed in Urology for the real clinical practice of GPs.  Methods:   An anonymous self-administered survey was carried out among GPs of Primary Care and Emergencies which sought to evaluate urological knowledge and necessary urological skills. The results of the survey were exported and descriptive statistics were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 19.0.  Results and limitations:   A total of 127 answers were obtained, in which 'Urological infections', 'Renal colic', 'PSA levels and screening for prostate cancer', 'Benign prostatic hyperplasia', 'Hematuria', 'Scrotal pain', 'Prostate cancer diagnosis', 'Bladder cancer diagnosis', 'Urinary incontinence', and 'Erectile dysfunction' were rated as Very high or High formative requirements (>75%). Regarding urological skills, 'Abdominal examination', 'Interpretation of urinalysis', 'Digital rectal examination', 'Genital examination', and 'Transurethral catheterization' were assessed as needing Very high or High training in more than 80% of the surveys. The relevance of urological pathology in clinical practice was viewed as Very high or High in more than 80% of the responses.

We established a proximity ligation assay (PLA) for the detection of endogenous FZD-co-receptor interactions and analyzed time-dependent Wnt pathway activation in cultured cells. Prostate cancer cells (PC-3) stimulated by Wnt ligands (Wnt5A, Wnt10B) were analyzed by Cy3-PLA for the co-localization of FZD6 and co-receptors (canonical: LRP6, non-canonical: ROR1) at the single-cell level. Downstream effector activation was assayed by immunocytochemistry. PLA allowed the specific (siRNA-verified) detection of FZD6-LRP6 and FZD6-ROR1 complexes as highly fluorescent spots. Incubation with Wnt10B led to increased FZD6-LRP6 interactions after 2 to 4 min and resulted in nuclear accumulation of β-catenin within 5 min. Wnt5A stimulation resulted in a higher number of FZD6-ROR1 complexes after 2 min. Elevated levels of phosphorylated myosin phosphatase target 1 suggested subsequent Wnt/PCP activation in PC-3. This is the first study demonstrating time-dependent interactions of endogenous Wnt (co-)receptors followed by rapid Wnt/β-catenin and Wnt/PCP activation in PC-3.

When SELENOF levels in human prostate immortalized epithelial cells were reduced with an shRNA construct, those cells acquired the ability to grow in soft agar, increased the ability to migrate in a scratch assay and acquired features of energy metabolism associated with prostate cancer.

To clarify the function of GPI-80 in tumor cells, GPI-80-expressing cells and GPI-80/VNN2 gene-deleted cells were established using PC3 prostate cancer cells. In GPI-80-expressing cells, GPI-80 was mainly detected in vesicles. Furthermore, soluble GPI-80 in the conditioned medium was associated with the exosome marker CD63 and was also detected in the plasma obtained from prostate cancer patients. Unexpectedly, cell adhesion and migration of GPI-80-expressing PC3 cells were not modulated by anti-GPI-80 antibody treatment. However, similar to the GPI-80 family molecule, VNN1, the pantetheinase activity and oxidative state were augmented in GPI-80-expressing cells. GPI-80-expressing cells facilitated non-adhesive proliferation, slow cell proliferation, NF-κB activation and IL-1β production.

Some CPPs also demonstrate intrinsic anticancer properties. Previously, our group developed a new family of CPP2-thiazole conjugates that have been shown to effectively reduce the proliferation of different cancer cells. This work aimed to combine these CPP2-thiazole conjugates with paclitaxel (PTX) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in PC-3 prostate and HT-29 colon cancer cells, respectively, to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of these combinations. We also combined these CPP2-thiazole conjugates with clotrimazole (CLZ), an antifungal agent that has been shown to decrease cancer cell proliferation. Cell viability was evaluated using MTT and SRB assays. Drug interaction was quantified using the Chou-Talalay method. We determined that CPP2 did not have significant activity in these cells and demonstrate that N-terminal modification of this peptide enhanced its anticancer activity in both cell lines. Our results also showed an uneven response between cell lines to the proposed combinations. PC-3 cells were more responsive to the combination of CPP2-thiazole conjugates with CLZ than PTX and were more sensitive to these combinations than HT-29 cells. In addition, the interaction of drugs resulted in more synergism in PC-3 cells. These results suggest that N-terminal modification of CPP2 results in the enhanced anticancer activity of the peptide and demonstrates the potential of CPPs as adjuvants in cancer therapy.

The aim of this study was to analyze the cytotoxic properties of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin on bladder and prostate cell lines in vitro.  Methods:   Bladder and prostate cancer cell lines together with their non-malignant counterparts were used in this study. In order to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of both drugs on tested cell lines, MTT assay, real-time cell growth analysis, apoptosis detection, cell cycle changes, molecular analysis, and 3D cultures were examined.  Results:   Both fluoroquinolones exhibited a toxic effect on all of the tested cell lines. In the case of non-malignant cell lines, the cytotoxic effect was weaker, which was especially pronounced in the bladder cell line. A comparison of both fluoroquinolones showed the advantage of ciprofloxacin (lower doses of drug caused a stronger cytotoxic effect). Both fluoroquinolones led to an increase in late apoptotic cells and an inhibition of cell cycle mainly in the S phase. Molecular analysis showed changes in BAX, BCL2, TP53, and CDKN1 expression in tested cell lines following incubation with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. The downregulation of topoisomerase II genes (TOP2A and TOP2B) was noticed. Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture analysis confirmed the higher cytotoxic effect of tested fluoroquinolone against cancer cell lines.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that both ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin may have great potential, especially in the supportive therapy of bladder cancer treatment.

DMCs identified in the promoter were located in sites recognized by multiple transcription factors, suggesting involvement in gene expression. Alterations in methylation were correlated to an aggressive phenotype in cancer cell lines. In prostate and lung adenocarcinomas, increased methylation of PA CGs was correlated to decreased ENPP2 mRNA expression and to poor prognosis parameters.

This highlights the need to understand the detailed DDR biology further and develop DDR-based biomarkers.

In contrast to the situation in humans, multi-gene approaches facilitating risk stratification of canine PCa are barely established. The aims of this study were the characterization of the transcriptional landscape of canine PCa and the identification of diagnostic, prognostic and/or therapeutic biomarkers through a multi-step screening approach. RNA-Sequencing of ten malignant tissues and fine-needle aspirations (FNA), and 14 nonmalignant tissues and FNAs was performed to find differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and deregulated pathways. The 4098 observed DEGs were involved in 49 pathways. These 49 pathways could be grouped into five superpathways summarizing the hallmarks of canine PCa: (i) inflammatory response and cytokines; (ii) regulation of the immune system and cell death; (iii) cell surface and PI3K signaling; (iv) cell cycle; and (v) phagosome and autophagy. Among the highly deregulated, moderately to strongly expressed DEGs that were members of one or more superpathways, 169 DEGs were listed in relevant databases and/or the literature and included members of the PCa pathway, oncogenes, prostate-specific genes, and druggable genes.

Accumulated studies have provided evidence that the expression of some FASTK genes is altered in certain types of cancer, in agreement with the central role of mitochondria in cancer development. Here, we obtained a pan-cancer overview of the genomic and transcriptomic alterations of FASTK genes. FASTK, FASTKD1, FASTKD3 and FASTKD5 showed the highest rates of genetic alterations. FASTK and FASTKD3 alterations consisted mainly of amplifications that were seen in more than 8% of ovarian and lung cancers, respectively. FASTKD1 and FASTKD5 were the most frequently mutated FASTK genes, and the mutations were identified in 5-7% of uterine cancers, as well as in 4% of melanomas. Our results also showed that the mRNA levels of all FASTK members were strongly upregulated in esophageal, stomach, liver and lung cancers. Finally, the protein-protein interaction network for FASTK proteins uncovers the interaction of FASTK, FASTKD2, FASTKD4 and FASTKD5 with cancer signaling pathways.

For patients with advanced or metastatic prostate cancer, available treatments can slow down its progression but cannot cure it. The development of innovative drugs resulting from the exploration of biodiversity could open new therapeutic alternatives. Dermaseptin-B2, a natural multifunctional antimicrobial peptide isolated from Amazonian frog skin, has been reported to possess antitumor activity. To improve its pharmacological properties and to decrease its peripheral toxicity and lethality we developed a hormonotoxin molecule composed of dermaseptin-B2 combined with d-Lys6-LHRH to target the LHRH receptor. This hormonotoxin has a significant antiproliferative effect on the PC3 tumor cell line, with an IC50 value close to that of dermaseptin-B2. Its antitumor activity has been confirmed in vivo in a xenograft mouse model with PC3 tumors and appears to be better tolerated than dermaseptin-B2. Biophysical experiments showed that the addition of LHRH to dermaseptin-B2 did not alter its secondary structure or biological activity. The combination of different experimental approaches indicated that this hormonotoxin induces cell death by an apoptotic mechanism instead of necrosis, as observed for dermaseptin-B2.

For its simplified regulatory permission, the radiation protection authorities require a 99mTc- activity below the exemption limit of 10 MBq at the time of surgery. Our aim was to determine the optimal amount of radioactivity (OAR) to comply with that limit and to estimate the maximum number of TPRS procedures per year and surgeon without triggering the full monitoring obligations.  Methods:   In this retrospective study, a dose rate meter was calibrated using measurements on phantoms and from recently injected (1 min p. i.) patients to determine the activity in the patient from measured dose rates. The effective half-life of 99mTc-PSMA-I&S in patients was determined from repeated dose rate measurements to estimate dose parameters of relevance for radiation protection. External exposures of the surgeons were measured with personal dosimeters calibrated in Hp(10). The surgeon's finger dose Hp(0.07) is estimated from radioactivity measured in resected lymph nodes. Potenzial incorporations were estimated for an activity of 10 MBq.  Results:   From the first 6 subsequent patients, an effective half-life of 4.15 h was observed. Assuming an operation time 24 h p. i., the OAR was 550 MBq. Operations lasting in average 2 h in a distance of 0.25 m to the patient imply a body dose for surgeons of 4.16 µSv per procedure. Based on these estimates, the surgeon's Hp(10) is less than 1 mSv per year with up to 241 operations per year. Hp(0.07) and potential incorporation of activity do not lead to further limitations.

The purpose of this research is to explore the role and action mechanism of STEAP4 in prostate cancer development under lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory microenvironment. STEAP4 expression was analyzed by Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), UALCAN and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), and its prognostic value was analyzed by LinkedOmics. STEAP4-correlated genes were analyzed by LinkedOmics and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. STEAP4 level was detected by Western blotting or qRT-PCR. Proliferation was investigated by CCK-8 and EdU staining. Inflammatory cytokine levels were detected by ELISA. The cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-protein kinase G (PKG) pathway was detected by ELISA and Western blotting. STEAP4 level was increased in prostate cancer tissues, and high expression of STEAP4 was associated with the poor overall survival. LPS promoted cell viability and STEAP4 expression. STEAP4 knockdown attenuated LPS-induced inflammation in prostate cancer cells. STEAP4 downregulation mitigated LPS-induced tumorigenesis by decreasing cell proliferation. STEAP4 silencing reversed LPS-induced inactivation of the cGMP-PKG pathway. Inhibition of the cGMP-PKG pathway using inhibitor KT5823 relieved STEAP4 silencing-mediated suppression of cell proliferation and inflammation in LPS-stimulated cells.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis have shown impressive clinical success, however, the majority of the patients do not respond to immune checkpoint therapy (ICT). Thus, to overcome ICT resistance there is a high need for potent and novel strategies that simultaneously target both tumor cells and immunosuppressive cells in the TME. In this study, we show that the intracellular light-controlled drug delivery method photochemical internalization (PCI) induce specific and strongly enhanced cytotoxic effects of the PD-L1-targeting immunotoxin, anti-PD-L1-saporin (Anti-PDL1-SAP), in the PD-L1+ triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell line, while no enhanced efficacy was obtained in the PD-L1 negative control cell line MDA-MB-453. Using fluorescence microscopy, we reveal that the anti-PD-L1 antibody binds to PD-L1 on the surface of the MDA-MD-231 cells and overnight accumulates in late endosomes and lysosomes where it co-localizes with the PCI photosensitizer fimaporfin (TPCS2a). Moreover, light-controlled endosomal/lysosomal escape of the anti-PD-L1 antibody and fimaporfin into the cytosol was obtained. We also confirm that the breast MDA-MB-468 and the prostate PC-3 and DU-145 cancer cell lines have subpopulations with PD-L1 expression. In addition, we show that interferon-gamma strongly induce PD-L1 expression in the per se PD-L1 negative CT26.WT cells and enhance the PD-L1 expression in MC-38 cells, of which both are murine colon cancer cell lines. In conclusion, our work provides an in vitro proof-of-concept of PCI-enhanced targeting and eradication of PD-L1 positive immunosuppressive cells.

Despite continued concerns about safety and short-term efficacy regarding the use of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate for the prevention of preterm birth in pregnant women, little is known about the long-term effects of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate on the health of the offsprings.  Objective:   To examine the association between in utero exposure to 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate and the risk of cancer in the offspring.  Study design:   The Child Health and Development Studies was a population-based cohort of >18,000 mother-child dyads receiving prenatal care in the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan (Oakland, CA) between 1959 and 1966. Clinical information was abstracted from the mothers' medical records beginning 6 months before pregnancy through delivery. We identified the number and timing of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate injections during pregnancy. Incident cancers diagnosed in the offspring were ascertained through 2019 by linkage to the California Cancer Registry. We used the Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the adjusted hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals, with the follow-up time accrued from the date of birth through the date of cancer diagnosis, death, or last contact.  Results:   A total of 1008 offspring were diagnosed with cancer over 730,817 person-years of follow-up. Approximately 1.0% of the offspring (n=234) were exposed in utero to 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate. Exposure in the first trimester was associated with an increased risk of any cancer (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.59-4.15), and the risk increased with the number of injections (1-2 injections: adjusted hazard ratio, 1.80; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-2.90; ≥3 injections: adjusted hazard ratio, 3.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.34-7.05). Exposure in the second or third trimester conferred an additional risk for the male (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-6.28) but not for the female (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.04-1.11) offspring. The risk of colorectal (adjusted hazard ratio, 5.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.73-17.59), prostate (adjusted hazard ratio, 5.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-21.00), and pediatric brain (adjusted hazard ratio, 34.72; 95% confidence interval, 7.29-164.33) cancer was higher in the offspring first exposed to 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate in the first trimester than the offspring not exposed.

The study's purpose is to find biomarkers of tumor metastasis by proteomics and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and to design related experiments to study its role in the progress and metastasis of PCa. Method: We analyzed serum from primary PCa stage and metastatic stage of 12 patients to find metastatic PCa serum protein biomarkers using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ). An effective diagnostic model based on validated biomarkers using logistic regression was established. In vivo and in vitro biological behavior experiments (wound healing, CCK8, and Transwell tests) were carried out after obtaining the biomarkers. Related mechanism has been studied, which may be associated with metastatic PCa. Result: Actin gamma 1 (ACTG1) is a potential biomarker in the metastasis of PCa. Bioinformatics and related experiments show that ACTG1 is high-expressed in PCa tissues and cells. In vivo and in vitro experiments illustrated that the ability of proliferation, migration, and invasion of PCa cells was significantly inhibited after the knockdown of ACTG1 expression. Surprisingly, ERK protein expression was downregulated after ACTG1 knockdown. At the same time, the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related markers in PCa cells decrease after treated with ERK1/2 inhibitor, which indicating that ACTG1 may affect the metastatic ability of PCa cells through MAPK/ERK signaling pathway.

The resulting parametric maps were centrally analyzed, where differentiation of benign from cancerous tissue was compared between DWI parameters and the fitting algorithms with a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC).  Statistical test:   Levene's test, P < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons was considered statistically significant.  Results:   The DRO results indicated minimal discordance between sites. Comparison across sites indicated that K, DK, and MEADC had significantly higher prostate cancer detection capability (AUC range = 0.72-0.76, 0.76-0.81, and 0.76-0.80 respectively) as compared to bi-exponential parameters (BID, BID*, F) which had lower AUC and greater between site variation (AUC range = 0.53-0.80, 0.51-0.81, and 0.52-0.80 respectively). Post-processing parameters also affected the resulting AUC, moving from, for example, 0.75 to 0.87 for MEADC varying cluster size.  Data conclusion:   We found that conventional diffusion models had consistent performance at differentiating prostate cancer from benign tissue. Our results also indicated that post-processing decisions on DWI data can affect sensitivity and specificity when applied to radiological-pathological studies in prostate cancer.

Serum samples and clinical data of 557 men who underwent RP for PCa with pathological stage (pT) <3 at Martini Clinic (Hamburg, Germany) were used for analysis. Clinical Grade Group and clinical stage was determined using biopsy samples while tumor marker concentrations were measured in serum using immunoassays. The prognostic utility of the proposed marker combination was assessed using Cox proportional hazard regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis. The performance was compared to the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score in the overall cohort and in a low-risk patient subset. A multivariable model comprising fibronectin 1, galectin-3-binding protein, lumican, matrix metalloprotease 9, thrombospondin-1 and PSA together with clinical Grade Group (GG) and clinical stage (cT) was created. The proposed model was a significant predictor of biochemical recurrence (BCR) (HR 1.29 per 5 units score, 95%CI 1.20-1.38, p<0.001). The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the proposed model had a better prediction for low-risk disease after RP compared to CAPRA (respectively 5.0% vs. 9.1% chance of BCR). In a pre-defined low risk population subset, the risk of BCR using the proposed model was below 5.2% and thus lower when compared to CAPRA = 0-2 (9%), GG<2 (7%) and NCCN = low-risk (6%) subsets. Additionally, the proposed model could significantly (p<0.001) discriminate patients with adverse pathology (AP) events at RP from those without. In conclusion, the proposed model is superior to CAPRA for the prediction of BCR after RP in the overall cohort as well as a in a pre-defined low risk patient population subset.

Objective:   To examine whether ADT is associated with a decreased rate of 30-day mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients with prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cohort study analyzed patient data recorded in the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium registry between March 17, 2020, and February 11, 2021. The consortium maintains a centralized multi-institution registry of patients with a current or past diagnosis of cancer who developed COVID-19. Data were collected and managed using REDCap software hosted at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. Initially, 1228 patients aged 18 years or older with prostate cancer listed as their primary malignant neoplasm were included; 122 patients with a second malignant neoplasm, insufficient follow-up, or low-quality data were excluded. Propensity matching was performed using the nearest-neighbor method with a 1:3 ratio of treated units to control units, adjusted for age, body mass index, race and ethnicity, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score, smoking status, comorbidities (cardiovascular, pulmonary, kidney disease, and diabetes), cancer status, baseline steroid use, COVID-19 treatment, and presence of metastatic disease.  Exposures:   Androgen deprivation therapy use was defined as prior bilateral orchiectomy or pharmacologic ADT administered within the prior 3 months of presentation with COVID-19.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcome was the rate of all-cause 30-day mortality after COVID-19 diagnosis for patients receiving ADT compared with patients not receiving ADT after propensity matching.  Results:   After exclusions, 1106 patients with prostate cancer (before propensity score matching: median age, 73 years [IQR, 65-79 years]; 561 (51%) self-identified as non-Hispanic White) were included for analysis. Of these patients, 477 were included for propensity score matching (169 who received ADT and 308 who did not receive ADT). After propensity matching, there was no significant difference in the primary end point of the rate of all-cause 30-day mortality (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.42-1.42).  Conclusions and relevance:   Findings from this cohort study suggest that ADT use was not associated with decreased mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Material and method:   Retrospective study lead in the Puigvert Foundation (Barcelona) registry of 1,200 KT performed from 1988 to 2018. Eighty-five urological malignancies that were treated before KT in 81 patients were identified: 15 (18%) prostate cancers, 49 (58%) RCC, 19 (22%) urothelial carcinomas and 2 (2%) testicular cancers.

With most of these automation networks, inter-observer variation is an acknowledged problem that leads to suboptimal results. This problem is even more significant in segmenting postoperative clinical target volumes (CTV) because they lack a macroscopic visible tumor in the image. This study, using postoperative prostate CTV segmentation as the test case, tries to determine 1) whether physician styles are consistent and learnable, 2) whether physician style affects treatment outcome and toxicity, and 3) how to explicitly deal with different physician styles in DL-assisted CTV segmentation to facilitate its clinical acceptance.  Methods:   A dataset of 373 postoperative prostate cancer patients from UT Southwestern Medical Center was used for this study. We used another 83 patients from Mayo Clinic to validate the developed model and its adaptability. To determine whether physician styles are consistent and learnable, we trained a 3D convolutional neural network classifier to identify which physician had contoured a CTV from just the contour and the corresponding CT scan. Next, we evaluated whether adapting automatic segmentation to specific physician styles would be clinically feasible based on a lack of difference between outcomes. Here, biochemical progression-free survival (BCFS) and grade 3+ genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between physician styles with the log rank test and subsequently with a multivariate Cox regression. When we found no statistically significant differences in outcome or toxicity between contouring styles, we proposed a concept called physician style-aware (PSA) segmentation by developing an encoder-multidecoder network with perceptual loss to model different physician styles of CTV segmentation.  Results:   The classification network captured the different physician styles with 87% accuracy. Subsequent outcome analysis showed no differences in BCFS and grade 3+ toxicity among physicians. With the proposed physician style-aware network (PSA-Net), Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) accuracy for all physicians was 3.4% higher on average than with a general model that does not differentiate physician styles. We show that these stylistic contouring variations also exist between institutions that follow the same segmentation guidelines, and we show the proposed method's effectiveness in adapting to new institutional styles. We observed an accuracy improvement of 5% in terms of DSC when adapting to the style of a separate institution.  Conclusion:   The performance of the classification network established that physician styles are learnable, and the lack of difference between outcomes among physicians shows that the network can feasibly adapt to different styles in the clinic. Therefore, we developed a novel PSA-Net model that can produce contours specific to the treating physician, thus improving segmentation accuracy and avoiding the need to train multiple models to achieve different style segmentations. We successfully validated this model on data from a separate institution, thus supporting the model's generalizability to diverse datasets.""","""['Anjali Balagopal', 'Howard Morgan', 'Michael Dohopolski', 'Ramsey Timmerman', 'Jie Shan', 'Daniel F Heitjan', 'Wei Liu', 'Dan Nguyen', 'Raquibul Hannan', 'Aurelie Garant', 'Neil Desai', 'Steve Jiang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Artif Intell Med""","""['A deep learning-based framework for segmenting invisible clinical target volumes with estimated uncertainties for post-operative prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Patient-specific transfer learning for auto-segmentation in adaptive 0.35 T MRgRT of prostate cancer: a bi-centric evaluation.', 'Automatic prostate segmentation using deep learning on clinically diverse 3D transrectal ultrasound images.', 'A deep learning-based approach to automatic proximal femur segmentation in quantitative CT images.', 'Investigation and benchmarking of U-Nets on prostate segmentation tasks.', 'Deep Learning in MRI-guided Radiation Therapy: A Systematic Review.', 'A deep learning model for lymph node metastasis prediction based on digital histopathological images of primary endometrial cancer.', 'Extensive upfront validation and testing are needed prior to the clinical implementation of AI-based auto-segmentation tools.', 'An attention base U-net for parotid tumor autosegmentation.', 'Deep learning in CT image segmentation of cervical cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Postimplant prostate D90 is a key dosimetric parameter showing the quality of low-dose-rate brachytherapy. In this study, to improve the quality of low-dose-rate brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer, we investigated pre-implant factors affecting the reduction of postimplant prostate D90.  Methods:   A total of 441 patients underwent low-dose-rate brachytherapy monotherapy and 474 patients underwent low-dose-rate brachytherapy with external beam radiation therapy. Logistic regression analysis was carried out to identify predictive factors for postimplant D90 decline. The cut-off value of the D90 decline was set at 170 Gy and 130 Gy in the low-dose-rate brachytherapy monotherapy group and low-dose-rate brachytherapy with external beam radiation therapy group, respectively.  Results:   On multivariate analysis, neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy was identified as an independent predictive factor for the decline of postimplant D90 in both the low-dose-rate brachytherapy monotherapy group (P < 0.001) and low-dose-rate brachytherapy with external beam radiation therapy group (P = 0.003). Prostate volume changes and computed tomography/transrectal ultrasound prostate volume ratio were significantly and negatively correlated with the postimplant D90. The prostate volume changes and computed tomography/transrectal ultrasound prostate volume ratio were significantly higher in patients with neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy than those without neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy decreased postimplant D90 with substantial prostate gland swelling after low-dose-rate brachytherapy.

These algorithms have wide applications in systems biology, protein function prediction, inferring condition-specifically altered sub-networks, and prioritizing disease genes. Despite the popularity of network propagation, there is a lack of comparative analyses of different algorithms on real data and little guidance on how to select and parameterize the various algorithms. Here, we address this problem by analyzing different combinations of network normalization and propagation methods and by demonstrating schemes for the identification of optimal parameter settings on real proteome and transcriptome data. Our work highlights the risk of a 'topology bias' caused by the incorrect use of network normalization approaches. Capitalizing on the fact that network propagation is a regularization approach, we show that minimizing the bias-variance tradeoff can be utilized for selecting optimal parameters. The application to real multi-omics data demonstrated that optimal parameters could also be obtained by either maximizing the agreement between different omics layers (e.g. proteome and transcriptome) or by maximizing the consistency between biological replicates. Furthermore, we exemplified the utility and robustness of network propagation on multi-omics datasets for identifying ageing-associated genes in brain and liver tissues of rats and for elucidating molecular mechanisms underlying prostate cancer progression.

Objective: Informed by the socioemotional selectivity theory, we hypothesized that older adults with cancer would be less depressed than younger adults, and subsequently less fearful of utilizing palliative care. Setting/Subjects: Patients predominately located in the United States with heterogeneous cancer diagnoses (n = 1095) completed the Patient-Reported Outcomes Information System (PROMIS) Depression scale and rated their fear of palliative care using the Palliative Care Attitudes Scale (PCAS). We examined the hypothesized intercorrelations, followed by a bootstrapped analysis of indirect effects in the PROCESS macro for SPSS. Results: Participants ranged from 26 to 93 years old (mean [M] = 60.40, standard deviation = 11.45). The most common diagnoses were prostate (34.1%), breast (23.3%), colorectal (17.5%), skin (15.3%), and lung (13.5%) cancer. As hypothesized, older participants had lower depression severity (r = -0.20, p < 0.001) and were less fearful of palliative care (r = -0.11, p < 0.001). Participants who were more depressed were more fearful of palliative care (r = 0.21, p < 0.001).

Methods:   We retrospectively included 123 biopsy-naïve men who underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and transperineal mpMRI-targeted and systematic prostate biopsy between April 2019 and October 2020. mpMRI, obtained on a 3.0T magnet with a PI-RADSv2.1-compliant protocol, was read by two radiologists (>1500/>500 mpMRI examinations). csPCa was defined as International Society of Urogenital Pathology grading group ≥2. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to calculate per-index lesion sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of PI-RADSv.2.1 categories after adjusting for PSAD ≥0.10,≥0.15, and ≥0.20 ng/mL ml-1. Per-adjusted category cancer detection rate (CDR) was calculated, and decision analysis performed to compare PSAD-adjusted PI-RADSv.2.1 categories as a biopsy trigger.  Results:   csPCa prevalence was 43.9%. PSAD-adjustment increased the CDR of PI-RADSv2.1 category 4.

The present study aimed to reduce the risk of BCR with a personalized dendritic cell (DC) vaccine, given as adjuvant therapy, after robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP).  Methods:   Twelve weeks after RALP, 20 patients with high-risk PC and undetectable PSA received DC vaccinations for 3 years or until BCR. The primary endpoint was the time to BCR. The immune response was assessed 7 weeks after surgery (baseline) and at one-time point during the vaccination period.  Results:   Among 20 patients, 11 were BCR-free over a median of 96 months (range: 84-99). The median time from the end of vaccinations to the last follow-up was 57 months (range: 45-60). Nine patients developed BCR, either during (n = 4) or after (n = 5) the vaccination period. Among five patients diagnosed with intraductal carcinoma, three experienced early BCR during the vaccination period. All patients that developed BCR remained in stable disease within a median of 99 months (range: 74-99). The baseline immune response was significantly associated with the immune response during the vaccination period (p = 0.015). For patients diagnosed with extraprostatic extension (EPE), time to BCR was longer in vaccine responders than in non-responders (p = 0.09). Among 12 patients with the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade 5 PC, five achieved remission after 84 months, and all mounted immune responses.  Conclusion:   Patients diagnosed with EPE and ISUP grade 5 PC were at particularly high risk of developing postsurgical BCR. In this subgroup, the vaccine response was related to a reduced BCR incidence. The vaccine was safe, without side effects.

Objective:   To evaluate changes in rates of PSA testing after revisions in the USPSTF guideline on prostate cancer screening.  Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective cohort study used deidentified claims data from Blue Cross Blue Shield beneficiaries aged 40 to 89 years from January 1, 2013, through December 31, 2019.  Exposures:   Publication of the USPSTF's draft (April 2017) and final (May 2018) recommendation on prostate cancer screening.  Main outcomes and measures:   Age-adjusted rates of PSA testing in bimonthly periods were calculated, and PSA testing rates from calendar years before (January 1 to December 31, 2016) and after (January 1 to December 31, 2019) the guideline change were compared. Interrupted time series analyses were used to evaluate the association of the draft (April 2017) and published (May 2018) USPSTF guideline with rates of PSA testing. Changes in rates of PSA testing were further evaluated among beneficiaries within the age categories reflected in the guideline: 40 to 54 years, 55 to 69 years, and 70 to 89 years.  Results:   The median number of eligible beneficiaries for each bimonthly period was 8 087 565 (range, 6 407 602-8 747 308), and the median age of all included eligible beneficiaries was 53 years (IQR, 47-59 years). Between 2016 and 2019, the mean (SD) rate of PSA testing increased from 32.5 (1.1) to 36.5 (1.1) tests per 100 person-years, a relative increase of 12.5% (95% CI, 1.1%-24.4%). During the same period, mean (SD) rates of PSA testing increased from 20.6 (0.8) to 22.7 (0.9) tests per 100 person-years among men aged 40 to 54 years (relative increase, 10.1%; 95% CI, -2.8% to 23.7%), from 49.8 (1.9) to 55.8 (1.8) tests per 100 person-years among men aged 55 to 69 years (relative increase, 12.1%; 95% CI, -0.2% to 25.2%), and from 38.0 (1.4) to 44.2 (1.4) tests per 100 person-years among men aged 70 to 89 years (relative increase, 16.2%; 95% CI, 4.2%-29.0%). Interrupted time series analysis revealed a significantly increasing trend of PSA testing after April 2017 among all beneficiaries (0.30 tests per 100 person-years for each bimonthly period; P < .001).  Conclusions and relevance:   This large national cohort study found that rates of PSA testing increased after the USPSTF's draft statement in 2017, reversing trends seen after earlier guidance against PSA testing for all patients.

Combining the PARP inhibitor olaparib with the MET inhibitor crizotinib synergistically inhibited CRPC cell growth both in vivo and in vitro. Further analysis of the underlying molecular mechanism underlying the MET suppression-induced drug sensitivity revealed that olaparib and crizotinib could together downregulate the ATM/ATR signaling pathway, inducing apoptosis by inhibiting the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathway, enhancing the olaparib-induced antitumour effect in DU145 and PC3 cells.

Silencing Akt1 inhibits prostate cancer (PCa) cells growing; slow-growing cells tend to consume less nutrition. It is suggested that Akt1-silenced cancer cells will have a more substantial tolerance to NST. Clarify this critical question is vital for tumor treatment strategies based on Akt1 and NST. The Akt1 gene of PC3 and DU145 cells was silenced by lent-virus. NST model was established by serum stripping. Cell viability was detected by MTT assay and cell counting method. Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL and flow cytometry, and cell invasion was determined by transwells and ECIS. The markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were detected by western blotting. PCa lung metastasis model was established by tail vein injection and quantified by Indian ink and GFP fluorescence. Silencing Akt1 slowed down the decrease of cell number and increase of apoptosis caused by NST. Silencing Akt1 with NST exposure in PCa cells could down-regulate epithelial markers (E-cadherin, claudin-5, and ZO-1) and up-regulate mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and EMT regulators Snail. Although silencing Akt1 enhanced the invasion of PCa cells induced by NST in vitro, silencing Akt1 inhibited the PCa lung metastasis induced by NST in vivo. Silencing Akt1 gene enhances the resistance of PCa cells to NST.

One of the important mechanisms for the development of CRPC is the persistent imbalanced regulation of AR and AR splice variants (AR/AR-Vs). In this study, we reported KDM4A-AS1, a recently discovered lncRNA, as a tumor promoter that was significantly increased in CRPC cell lines and cancer tissues. Depletion of KDM4A-AS1 significantly reduced cell viability, proliferation, migration in vitro, and tumor growth in vivo. We found that by binding to the NTD domain, KDM4A-AS1 enhances the stability of USP14-AR/AR-Vs complex, and promoted AR/AR-Vs deubiquitination to protect it from MDM2-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome degradation. Moreover, KDM4A-AS1 was found to enhance CRPC drug resistance to enzalutamide by repressing AR/AR-Vs degradation; antisense oligonucleotide drugs targeting KDM4A-AS1 significantly reduced the growth of tumors with enzalutamide resistance. Taken together, our results indicated that KDM4A-AS1 played an important role in the progression of CRPC and enzalutamide resistance by regulating AR/AR-Vs deubiquitination; targeting KDM4A-AS1 has broad clinical application potential.""","""['Boya Zhang#', 'Mingpeng Zhang#', 'Yanjie Yang', 'Qi Li', 'Jianpeng Yu', 'Shimiao Zhu', 'Yuanjie Niu', 'Zhiqun Shang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Retraction Note: Targeting KDM4A-AS1 represses AR/AR-Vs deubiquitination and enhances enzalutamide response in CRPC.', 'LncRNA PCBP1-AS1-mediated AR/AR-V7 deubiquitination enhances prostate cancer enzalutamide resistance.', 'Histone acetyltransferase 1 upregulates androgen receptor expression to modulate CRPC cell resistance to enzalutamide.', 'Combination therapy with androgen receptor N-terminal domain antagonist EPI-7170 and enzalutamide yields synergistic activity in AR-V7-positive prostate cancer.', 'Targeting persistent androgen receptor signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Role of Androgen Receptor Variants in Prostate Cancer: Report from the 2017 Mission Androgen Receptor Variants Meeting.', 'Machine learning-based construction of a ferroptosis and necroptosis associated lncRNA signature for predicting prognosis and immunotherapy response in hepatocellular cancer.', 'Post-transcriptional modification of m6A methylase METTL3 regulates ERK-induced androgen-deprived treatment resistance prostate cancer.', 'Identification of a cuproptosis and copper metabolism gene-related lncRNAs prognostic signature associated with clinical and immunological characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'E2F1-mediated KDM4A-AS1 up-regulation promotes EMT of hepatocellular carcinoma cells by recruiting ILF3 to stabilize AURKA mRNA.', 'The crosstalk between ubiquitination and endocrine therapy.']"""

This study aims at investigating the incidence rates and trends of prostate cancer in Lebanon, and to compare them to those of countries from different regions in the world.  Methods:   Data on prostate cancer were obtained from the Lebanese national cancer registry for the years 2005 to 2016. The calculated age-standardized incidence and age-specific rates were expressed as per 100 000 population.  Results:   In Lebanon, prostate cancer is ranked as the most common cancer in men. The age-standardized incidence rate of prostate cancer has increased from 29.1 per 100 000 in 2005 to 37.3 per 100 000 in 2016; the highest rate was in 2012, surpassing the global average incidence rate for that year. The age-specific incidence rate of prostate cancer has increased exponentially starting at the age of 50 years to reach its peak in men aged 75 years or more. Two trends were identified in the age-standardized incidence rate of prostate cancer; an average significant increase of 7.28% per year for the period 2005-2009 (P-value < .05), followed by a non-significant decrease of around .99% for the period between 2009 and 2016 (P-value > .05). The age-standardized incidence rate in Lebanon was higher than most countries in the Middle East and North Africa region and Asia, but lower than the rates reported in Australia, America, and different European countries.  Conclusion:   Prostate cancer is the leading cancer among men in Lebanon. Screening practices, changes in population age structure, and prevalence of genetic and risky lifestyle factors may explain the increased incidence rates of prostate cancer. Given the controversy of screening recommendations and the slow growing nature of prostate cancer, increasing public awareness on ways of prevention, and implementing the latest screening recommendation of the United States Preventive Services Task Force are the suggested way forward.""","""['Najla A Lakkis', 'Mona H Osman']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Control""","""['Cervix Uteri Cancer in Lebanon: Incidence, Temporal Trends, and Comparison to Countries From Different Regions in the World.', 'Lung Cancer and Risk Factors in Lebanon: Epidemiology, Temporal Trends, and Comparison to Countries From Different Regions in the World.', 'Colorectal Cancer in Lebanon: Incidence, Temporal Trends, and Comparison to Regional and Western Countries.', 'Recent Global Patterns in Prostate Cancer Incidence and Mortality Rates.', 'Patterns and trends in prostate cancer incidence, survival, prevalence and mortality.

Patients and methods:   Eligible men with nmCRPC, PSA doubling time ≤10 months and PSA ≥2 ng/mL with continued ADT use were randomised 2:1 to enzalutamide 160 mg or placebo. OS and safety were examined by age (<70 vs ≥70 years) and region (North America, Europe, Asia or the rest of the world). The impact of prior and subsequent therapy was also examined.  Results:   In total, 1401 men were enrolled (median age, 74 years). Enzalutamide plus ADT reduced the risk of death, independent of age or region. Multivariate analyses identified Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status (P < 0.0001), log (PSA; P = 0.0002) and subsequent therapy (P < 0.0001) as statistically significant factors impacting OS.

Existing automated methods of prostate cancer detection mostly rely on ground truth labels with limited accuracy, ignore disease pathology characteristics observed on resected tissue, and cannot selectively identify aggressive (Gleason Pattern≥4) and indolent (Gleason Pattern=3) cancers when they co-exist in mixed lesions. In this paper, we present a radiology-pathology fusion approach, CorrSigNIA, for the selective identification and localization of indolent and aggressive prostate cancer on MRI. CorrSigNIA uses registered MRI and whole-mount histopathology images from radical prostatectomy patients to derive accurate ground truth labels and learn correlated features between radiology and pathology images. These correlated features are then used in a convolutional neural network architecture to detect and localize normal tissue, indolent cancer, and aggressive cancer on prostate MRI. CorrSigNIA was trained and validated on a dataset of 98 men, including 74 men that underwent radical prostatectomy and 24 men with normal prostate MRI. CorrSigNIA was tested on three independent test sets including 55 men that underwent radical prostatectomy, 275 men that underwent targeted biopsies, and 15 men with normal prostate MRI. CorrSigNIA achieved an accuracy of 80% in distinguishing between men with and without cancer, a lesion-level ROC-AUC of 0.81±0.31 in detecting cancers in both radical prostatectomy and biopsy cohort patients, and lesion-levels ROC-AUCs of 0.82±0.31 and 0.86±0.26 in detecting clinically significant cancers in radical prostatectomy and biopsy cohort patients respectively. CorrSigNIA consistently outperformed other methods across different evaluation metrics and cohorts. In clinical settings, CorrSigNIA may be used in prostate cancer detection as well as in selective identification of indolent and aggressive components of prostate cancer, thereby improving prostate cancer care by helping guide targeted biopsies, reducing unnecessary biopsies, and selecting and planning treatment.""","""['Indrani Bhattacharya', 'Arun Seetharaman', 'Christian Kunder', 'Wei Shao', 'Leo C Chen', 'Simon J C Soerensen', 'Jeffrey B Wang', 'Nikola C Teslovich', 'Richard E Fan', 'Pejman Ghanouni', 'James D Brooks', 'Geoffrey A Sonn', 'Mirabela Rusu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Med Image Anal""","""['Bridging the gap between prostate radiology and pathology through machine learning.', 'Automated detection of aggressive and indolent prostate cancer on magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Computational Detection of Extraprostatic Extension of Prostate Cancer on Multiparametric MRI Using Deep Learning.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Artificial Intelligence in Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: Where Do We Stand in 2021?', 'Anatomically guided self-adapting deep neural network for clinically significant prostate cancer detection on bi-parametric MRI: a multi-center study.', 'Three-dimensional convolutional neural network model to identify clinically significant prostate cancer in transrectal ultrasound videos: a prospective, multi-institutional, diagnostic study.', 'Tumor Area Highlighting Using T2WI, ADC Map, and DWI Sequence Fusion on bpMRI Images for Better Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'A review of artificial intelligence in prostate cancer detection on imaging.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Based Predictive Models for Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.']"""

Methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2010-2016), we identified 2290 NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) high-risk (HR) Hispanic/Latino prostate cancer patients. Of those, 893 (39.0%) were treated with RP vs 1397 (61.0%) with EBRT. First, cumulative incidence plots and competing risks regression models tested for CSM differences after adjustment for other cause mortality (OCM). Second, cumulative incidence plots and competing risks regression models were refitted after 1:1 propensity score matching (according to age, PSA, biopsy Gleason score, cT-stage, cN-stage).  Results:   In NCCN HR patients, 5-year CSM rates for RP vs EBRT were 2.4 vs 4.7%, yielding a multivariable hazard ratio of 0.37 (95% CI 0.19-0.73, p = 0.004) favoring RP. However, after propensity score matching, the hazard ratio of 0.54 was no longer statistically significant (95% CI 0.21-1.39, p = 0.2).  Conclusion:   Without the use of strictest adjustment for population differences, NCCN high-risk Hispanic/Latino prostate cancer patients appear to benefit more of RP than EBRT.

The procedure is blind to underlying prostate tissue micro-structure; hence, it can lead to a high rate of false negatives. Development of a machine-learning model that can reliably identify suspicious cancer regions is highly desirable. However, the models proposed to-date do not consider the uncertainty present in their output or the data to benefit clinical decision making for targeting biopsy.  Methods:   We propose a deep network for improved detection of prostate cancer in systematic biopsy considering both the label and model uncertainty. The architecture of our model is based on U-Net, trained with temporal enhanced ultrasound (TeUS) data. We estimate cancer detection uncertainty using test-time augmentation and test-time dropout. We then use uncertainty metrics to report the cancer probability for regions with high confidence to help the clinical decision making during the biopsy procedure.  Results:   Experiments for prostate cancer classification includes data from 183 prostate biopsy cores of 41 patients. We achieve an area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity and balanced accuracy of 0.79, 0.78, 0.71 and 0.75, respectively.

Methods:   Between 2016 and 2020, we recruited 2,200 PCa cases and 1,985 age-matched controls into a multi-center, hospital-based case-control study in Senegal, Ghana, Nigeria, and South Africa. Participants completed an epidemiologic questionnaire, and anthropometric factors were measured at clinic visit.

(95% confidence interval: 0.604-0.805, Youden index = 0.401, sensitivity = 82.5%, specificity = 57.6%, p < 0.01). Multivariate Cox analysis showed that clinical staging, prostate-specific antigen, and PNI were independent prognostic factors for predicting BCR in patients treated with RALP.  Conclusion:   PNI is an independent prognostic factor for predicting BCR in patients treated with RALP. The incorporation of the PNI into risk assessments may provide additional prognostic information.""","""['Nichujie Li', 'Wei-Jie Song', 'Jun Gao', 'Zhi-Peng Xu', 'Zhi Long', 'Jian-Ye Liu', 'Le-Ye He']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Risk of biochemical recurrence based on extent and location of positive surgical margins after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Can robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) be performed very soon after biopsy?', 'Predictors of biochemical recurrence after Retzius-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: Analysis of 359 cases with a median follow-up period of 26\xa0months.', 'Biochemical recurrence-free conditional probability after radical prostatectomy: A dynamic prognosis.', 'The importance of surgical margins in prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic value of a baseline prognostic nutritional index for patients with prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The Predictive Significance of Prognostic Nutritional Index and Serum Albumin/Globulin Ratio on the Overall Survival of Penile Cancer Patients Undergoing Penectomy.', 'Prognostic value of combined inflammatory and nutritional biomarkers in HCC within the Milan criteria after hepatectomy.']"""

The aim was to show our code is capable of replicating experimental results in order to use it to advise similar future studies and to predict the outcomes. The experiment performed to benchmark our code used large volume liquid tissue phantoms to simulate the scattering properties of human tissue. The scattering agent used was Intralipid (IL), of various concentrations, filling a small quartz tank. A thin sample of PTFE was made to act as a distinct layer in the tank; this was our Raman signal source. We studied experimentally, and then reproduced via simulations, the variation in Raman signal strength in a transmission geometry as a function of the optical properties of the scattering agent and the location of the Raman material in the volume. We have also found that a direct linear extrapolation of scattering coefficients between concentrations of Intralipid is an incorrect assumption at lower concentrations when determining the optical properties. By combining experimental and simulation results, we have calculated different estimates of these scattering coefficients. The results of this study give insight into light propagation and Raman transport in scattering media and show how the location of maximum Raman signal varies as the optical properties change. The success of arctk in reproducing observed experimental signal behaviour will allow us in future to inform the development of noninvasive cancer screening applications (such as breast and prostate cancers) in vivo.""","""['Laura J Moran', 'Freddy Wordingham', 'Benjamin Gardner', 'Nicholas Stone', 'Tim J Harries']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Analyst""","""['Studying the distribution of deep Raman spectroscopy signals using liquid tissue phantoms with varying optical properties.', 'Experimental validation of a spectroscopic Monte Carlo light transport simulation technique and Raman scattering depth sensing analysis in biological tissue.', 'Dependence of optical scattering from Intralipid in gelatin-gel based tissue-mimicking phantoms on mixing temperature and time.', 'Thermal stability of intralipid optical phantoms.', 'Recent advances in the development of Raman spectroscopy for deep non-invasive medical diagnosis.', 'Tomographic Imaging and Localization of Nanoparticles in Tissue Using Surface-Enhanced Spatially Offset Raman Spectroscopy.']"""

Our purpose was to evaluate PSMA expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), and hepatic adenoma (HCA); investigate the genetic pathways in HCC associated with PSMA expression; and evaluate HCC detection rate with 68 Ga-PSMA-11 positron emission tomography (PET). In phase 1, PSMA immunohistochemistry (IHC) on HCC (n = 148), CCA (n = 111), and HCA (n = 78) was scored. In a subset (n = 30), messenger RNA (mRNA) data from the Cancer Genome Atlas HCC RNA sequencing were correlated with PSMA expression. In phase 2, 68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET was prospectively performed in patients with treatment-naïve HCC on a digital PET scanner using cyclotron-produced 68 Ga. Uptake was graded qualitatively and semi-quantitatively using standard metrics. On IHC, PSMA expression was significantly higher in HCC compared with CCA and HCA (P < 0.0001); 91% of HCCs (n = 134) expressed PSMA, which principally localized to tumor-associated neovasculature. Higher tumor grade was associated with PSMA expression (P = 0.012) but there was no association with tumor size (P = 0.14), fibrosis (P = 0.35), cirrhosis (P = 0.74), hepatitis B virus (P = 0.31), or hepatitis C virus (P = 0.15). Overall survival tended to be longer in patients without versus with PSMA expression (median overall survival: 4.2 vs. 1.9 years; P = 0.273). FGF14 (fibroblast growth factor 14) mRNA expression correlated positively (rho = 0.70; P = 1.70 × 10-5 ) and MAD1L1 (Mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint protein MAD1) correlated negatively with PSMA expression (rho = -0.753; P = 1.58 × 10-6 ). Of the 190 patients who met the eligibility criteria, 31 patients with 39 HCC lesions completed PET; 64% (n = 25) lesions had pronounced 68 Ga-PSMA-11 standardized uptake value: SUVmax (median [range] 9.2 [4.9-28.4]), SUVmean 4.7 (2.4-12.7), and tumor-to-liver background ratio 2 (1.1-11).

Methods:   We retrospectively identified 72 consecutive prostate cancer patients with somatic SPOP mutations, through next-generation sequencing analysis, who were treated at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. We evaluated clinical and genomic characteristics of this SPOP-mutant subset.  Results:   SPOP alterations were clustered in the MATH domain, with hotspot mutations involving the F133 and F102 residues. The most frequent concurrent genetic alterations were in APC (16/72 [22%]), PTEN (13/72 [18%]), and TP53 (11/72 [15%]). SPOP-mutant cancers appeared to be mutually exclusive with tumors harboring the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, and were significantly enriched for Wnt pathway (APC, CTNNB1) mutations and de-enriched for TP53/PTEN/RB1 alterations. Patients with mtSPOP had durable responses to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with a median time-to-castration-resistance of 42.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 25.7-60.8) months. However, time-to-castration-resistance was significantly shorter in SPOP-mutant patients with concurrent TP53 mutations (hazard ratio [HR] 4.53; p = 0.002), HRD pathway (ATM, BRCA1/2, and CHEK2) mutations (HR 3.19; p = 0.003), and PI3K pathway (PTEN, PIK3CA, and AKT1) alterations (HR 2.69; p = 0.004). In the castration-resistant prostate cancer setting, median progression-free survival was 8.9 (95% CI, 6.7-NR) months on abiraterone and 7.3 (95% CI, 3.2-NR) months on enzalutamide. There were no responses to PARP inhibitor treatment.  Conclusions:   SPOP-mutant prostate cancers represent a unique subset with absent ERG fusions and frequent Wnt pathway alterations, with potentially greater dependency on androgen signaling and enhanced responsiveness to ADT.

Methods:   In our retrospective, single-center study, 101 eligible patients with at least one PIRADS category 3 lesion but no higher PIRADS lesions underwent MRI/US fusion biopsies between September 2017 and June 2020. Thirty additional patients were included as the validation cohort from the next chronological period from June 2020 to October 2020. Our ML research was a supervised classification problem, with a binary output based on pathological reports of cancerous or benign tissue. The clinical inputs were age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostate volume, prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD), and the number of previous biopsies. The radiology-report inputs were the number of lesions, maximum lesion diameter, lesion location, and lesion zone. We subsequently removed the inputs with low importance. Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting Tree (XGBoost) were employed. From receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, we determined Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), the cut-off point, and sensitivity score (recall score) to evaluate the ML-model performance.  Results:   Twenty-four adenocarcinoma patients had a mean age of 70 ± 5.79 years, a mean PSA of 12.42 ± 6.67 ng/ml, a mean prostate volume of 46.49 ± 23.13 ml, and a mean PSAD of 0.31 ± 0.22 ng/ml2 . Seventy-seven patients with benign tissue reports had a mean age of 66.39 ± 6.66 years, a mean PSA of 11.31 ± 7.50 ng/ml, a mean prostate volume of 65.25 ± 35.88 ml, and a mean PSAD of 0.19 ± 0.13 ng/ml2 . On the validation cohort, XGBoost had the best AUC of 0.76, which considered 80% sensitivity and 72% specificity at a probability cutoff of 57%. The remaining possible ML models performed worse with lesser AUC. The worst was Naïve Bayes, with AUC of 0.50.

The WST assay revealed that VP16 had a significant antitumor effect on PC3CR cells. PC3CR cells exhibited significantly higher topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A) expression than PC3 cells. Higher TOP2A expression was a poor prognostic factor in The Cancer Genome Atlas prostate cancer cohort. In the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center dataset, docetaxel-exposed tissues and metastatic tumors had higher TOP2A expression.

The transcription factor NF-Y participates to the progression from benign epithelium to both localized and metastatic PCa and is associated with aggressive transcriptional profile. The gene encoding for NF-YA, the DNA-binding subunit of NF-Y, produces two alternatively spliced transcripts, NF-YAs and NF-YAl. Bioinformatic analyses pointed at NF-YA splicing as a key transcriptional signature to discriminate between different tumor molecular subtypes. In this study, we aimed to determine the pathophysiological role of NF-YA splice variants in PCa and their association with aggressive subtypes.  Methods:   Data on the expression of NF-YA isoforms were extracted from the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database of tumor prostate tissues and validated in prostate cell lines. Lentiviral transduction and CRISPR-Cas9 technology allowed the modulation of the expression of NF-YA splice variants in PCa cells. We characterized 3D cell cultures through in vitro assays and RNA-seq profilings. We used the rank-rank hypergeometric overlap approach to identify concordant/discordant gene expression signatures of NF-YAs/NF-YAl-overexpressing cells and human PCa patients. We performed in vivo studies in SHO-SCID mice to determine pathological and molecular phenotypes of NF-YAs/NF-YAl xenograft tumors.  Results:   NF-YA depletion affects the tumorigenic potential of PCa cells in vitro and in vivo. Elevated NF-YAs levels are associated to aggressive PCa specimens, defined by Gleason Score and TNM classification. NF-YAl overexpression increases cell motility, while NF-YAs enhances cell proliferation in PCa 3D spheroids and xenograft tumors. The transcriptome of NF-YAs-spheroids has an extensive overlap with localized and metastatic human PCa signatures. According to PCa PAM50 classification, NF-YAs transcript levels are higher in LumB, characterized by poor prognosis compared to LumA and basal subtypes. A significant decrease in NF-YAs/NF-YAl ratio distinguishes PCa circulating tumor cells from cancer cells in metastatic sites, consistently with pro-migratory function of NF-YAl.

Methods:   Eighty-four patients, who were diagnosed with high-risk non-muscle-invasive and muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma and underwent LRC with an ileal conduit between January 2018 and April 2020, were retrospectively evaluated. Thirty and fifty-four patients respectively underwent the three-port approach and five-port LRC. Clinical characteristics, pathological data, perioperative outcomes, and follow-up data were analysed.  Results:   There were no differences in perioperatively surgical outcome, including pathology type, prostate adenocarcinoma incidence, tumour staging, and postoperative creatinine levels between the two groups. The operative time (271.3 ± 24.03 vs. 279.57 ± 48.47 min, P = 0.299), estimated blood loss (65 vs. 90 mL, P = 0.352), time to passage of flatus (8 vs. 10 days, P = 0.084), and duration of hospitalisation post-surgery (11 vs. 12 days, P = 0.922) were no clear difference between both groups. Compared with the five-port group, the three-port LRC group was related to lower inpatient costs (12 453 vs. 14 134 $, P = 0.021). Our follow-up results indicated that the rate of postoperative complications, 90-day mortality, and the oncological outcome did not show meaningful differences between these two groups.  Conclusions:   Three-port LRC with an ileal conduit is technically safe and feasible for the treatment of bladder cancer.

Various local treatments are available with mitigated functional and oncological outcomes. The aim of the present study was to evaluate perioperative and oncological results of salvage cryotherapy (CT) as treatment of local recurrence of prostate cancer.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed all patients treated with hemi-prostatic salvage CT for local recurrence of prostate cancer in 1 academic hospital between November 2011 and April 2019. Local recurrence was defined according to the Phoenix criteria (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] nadir + 2 ng/mL), associated with a prostatic MRI target lesion and confirmed by biopsy. Perioperative and functional complications were collected. Cox regression was conducted to assess factors associated with time to initiation of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Statistical analyses were conducted using R Studio.  Results:   A total of 29 patients were treated with an average follow-up of 37.6 months. Median age at CT was 77 years. Median PSA before CT was 5.1 ng/mL (min-max: 2.74-18). 17.2% of patients displayed a high D'Amico risk group. Median hospital stay was 1.4 days. Four patients (13.8%) experienced postoperative acute urinary retention. Nineteen patients (65.5%) experienced late functional complications (3 erectile dysfunctions, 3 stress incontinence, and 13 urinary frequency). Fourteen patients displayed recurrence after salvage treatment (48.2%). Median time to introduction of ADT was 15.1 months. ADT-free survival at 1 and 2 years was, respectively, 74% and 61%. In multivariate analysis, ISUP score 4 and PSA nadir <1 ng/mL after CT were significantly associated with time to ADT initiation.

However, limited knowledge exists about pelvic cancer survivors' LRTI symptoms, distress, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). We sought to assess the symptom burden, distress, and HRQOL in survivors with established pelvic LRTIs compared to norm populations and to investigate the relation between these factors.  Methods:   Cancer survivors referred for treatment of established pelvic LRTIs were recruited nationwide. LTRIs were assessed with the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC), psychological distress was assessed with the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), and HRQOL was assessed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORCT-QLQ-C30).  Results:   A total of 107 participants (mean age 64, 53% men) were included. Compared to norms, participants reported more urinary (mean 68.7 vs. 89.5; p = 0.00; d = 1.4) and bowel symptoms (mean 62.5 vs. 92.4; p = 0.00; d = 2.7), increased psychological distress (mean 13.4 vs. 10.3; p = 0.00; d = 0.6), and overall poorer HRQOL (mean 54.9 vs. 71.2; p = 0.00; d = 0.7). Higher symptom burden and higher levels of psychological distress were associated with lower HRQOL (r2 = 46%), but psychological distress did not moderate the influence of symptoms on HRQOL.  Conclusion:   Cancer survivors with established pelvic LRTIs are highly burdened compared to norms. The association of the LRTI-related symptom burden with HRQOL is independent of the level of psychological distress.

We demonstrate that CD93 CAR T cells engineered from a novel humanized CD93-specific binder potently kill AML in vitro and in vivo but spare hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC). No toxicity is seen in murine models, but CD93 is expressed on human endothelial cells, and CD93 CAR T cells recognize and kill endothelial cell lines. We identify other AML CAR T-cell targets with overlapping expression on endothelial cells, especially in the context of proinflammatory cytokines. To address the challenge of endothelial-specific cross-reactivity, we provide proof of concept for NOT-gated CD93 CAR T cells that circumvent endothelial cell toxicity in a relevant model system. We also identify candidates for combinatorial targeting by profiling the transcriptome of AML and endothelial cells at baseline and after exposure to proinflammatory cytokines.  Significance:   CD93 CAR T cells eliminate AML and spare HSPCs but exert on-target, off-tumor toxicity to endothelial cells. We show coexpression of other AML targets on endothelial cells, introduce a novel NOT-gated strategy to mitigate endothelial toxicity, and demonstrate use of high-dimensional transcriptomic profiling for rational design of combinatorial immunotherapies.See related commentary by Velasquez and Gottschalk, p. 559.

We compared clinical outcomes, and other genomic characteristics, among BRCA1- versus BRCA2-altered mCRPC.  Results:   A total of 123 patients (13 BRCA1 and 110 BRCA2) were included. PARP inhibitors used were olaparib (n = 116), rucaparib (n = 3), talazoparib (n = 2), and veliparib (n = 2). At diagnosis, 72% of patients had Gleason 8-10 disease. BRCA1 patients were more likely to have metastatic disease at presentation (69% v 37%; P = .04). Age, baseline PSA, metastatic distribution, and types of previous systemic therapies were similar between groups. There were equal proportions of germline mutations (51% v 46%; P = .78) in both groups. BRCA1 patients had more monoallelic (56% v 41%; P = .49) and concurrent TP53 (55% v 36%; P = .32) mutations. PSA50 responses in BRCA1- versus BRCA2-altered patients were 23% versus 63%, respectively (P = .01). BRCA2 patients achieved longer PSA-PFS (HR, 1.94; 95% CI, 0.92 to 4.09; P = .08), PFS (HR, 2.08; 95% CI, 0.99 to 4.40; P = .05), and overall survival (HR, 3.01; 95% CI, 1.32 to 6.83; P = .008). Biallelic (compared with monoallelic) mutations, truncating (compared with missense) mutations, and absence of a concurrent TP53 mutation were associated with PARP inhibitor sensitivity.  Conclusion:   PARP inhibitor efficacy is diminished in BRCA1- versus BRCA2-altered mCRPC. This is not due to an imbalance in germline mutations but might be related to more monoallelic mutations and/or concurrent TP53 alterations in the BRCA1 group.""","""['Fadi Taza', 'Albert E Holler', 'Wei Fu', 'Hao Wang', 'Nabil Adra', 'Costantine Albany', 'Ryan Ashkar', 'Heather H Cheng', 'Alexandra O Sokolova', 'Neeraj Agarwal', 'Adam Kessel', 'Alan Bryce', 'Nellie Nafissi', 'Pedro Barata', 'A Oliver Sartor', 'Diogo Bastos', 'Oren Smaletz', 'Jacob E Berchuck', 'Mary-Ellen Taplin', 'Rahul Aggarwal', 'Cora N Sternberg', 'Panagiotis J Vlachostergios', 'Ajjai S Alva', 'Christopher Su', 'Catherine H Marshall', 'Emmanuel S Antonarakis']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""JCO Precis Oncol""","""['Differential Response to Olaparib Treatment Among Men with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Harboring BRCA1 or BRCA2 Versus ATM Mutations.', 'Rucaparib in Men With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Harboring a BRCA1 or BRCA2 Gene Alteration.', 'Polyclonal BRCA2 mutations following carboplatin treatment confer resistance to the PARP inhibitor rucaparib in a patient with mCRPC: a case report.', 'Emerging Role of PARP Inhibitors in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'A Novel Use of Olaparib for the Treatment of Metastatic Castration-Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'Roles of the PARP Inhibitor in BRCA1 and BRCA2 Pathogenic Mutated Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Direct Functions and Modification of the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'PARP inhibitors in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'BRCA1/2 Reversion Mutations in Patients Treated with Poly ADP-Ribose Polymerase (PARP) Inhibitors or Platinum Agents.', 'Integrative Genomic Tests in Clinical Oncology.', 'PARP inhibitors on the move in prostate cancer: spotlight on Niraparib & update on PARP inhibitor combination trials.']"""

IL-15 can effectively reduce tumor growth in many preclinical tumor models including prostate cancer. This is due to its ability to expand and activate immune cells, such as CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells. To increase the potency of IL-15, we have engineered a protein variant that can be modified to localize and be retained in tissues where it is administered. However, the production of recombinant IL-15, the purity, and correct refolding of the final protein is not always ideal. In the current study, we aimed to optimize the methodology for production and purification of a modified recombinant human IL-15 and investigate the efficacy of the produced protein in the treatment of prostate tumors. Human IL-15 with its polypeptide sequence modified at the C-terminus to enable thiol conjugation with membrane localizing peptides, was produced in E. coli and purified using mild denaturing conditions (2M urea) from a washing step or from solubilization of inclusion bodies. The purified protein from the wash fraction was conjugated to a myristoylated peptide to form a membrane-localizing IL-15 (cyto-IL-15). The efficacy of cyto-IL-15 was investigated in subcutaneous TRAMP-C2 prostate tumors in mice and compared with cyto-IL-15 derived from protein purified from inclusion bodies (cyto-IL-15 Gen). When mild denaturing conditions were used for purification, the largest amount of IL-15 was collected from the wash fraction and a smaller amount from inclusion bodies. The protein from the wash fraction was mainly present as a monomer, whereas the one from inclusion bodies formed homodimers and higher complexes. After cytotopic modification, the purified IL-showed great efficacy in delaying prostate tumor growth (∼50%) and increased mice survival by ∼1.8-fold compared with vehicle. This study demonstrates an alternative, inexpensive and efficient method to produce and purify a modified version of IL-15 using mild denaturing conditions. This IL-15, when cytotopically modified, showed great efficacy as a monotherapy in prostate tumors in mice further highlighting the potential of IL-15 as a cancer immunotherapy.""","""['Ana M Esteves', 'Efthymia Papaevangelou', 'Dorota Smolarek', 'Prokar Dasgupta', 'Christine Galustian']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Front Mol Biosci""","""['Targeting Prostate Cancer Using Intratumoral Cytotopically Modified Interleukin-15 Immunotherapy in a Syngeneic Murine Model.', 'Comparison of the purification of biologically active IL-7 cytokine expressed in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris.', 'Purification of Recombinant GM-CSF/IL-3 Fusion Protein.', 'Solubilization and refolding of bacterial inclusion body proteins.', 'IL-15 in the Combination Immunotherapy of Cancer.', 'Cyto-IL-15 synergizes with the STING agonist ADU-S100 to eliminate prostate tumors and confer durable immunity in mouse models.']"""

Methods: We obtained summary statistics for EA and 14 urological and reproductive health outcomes from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). MR analyses were applied to explore the potential causal association between EA and them. Inverse variance weighted was the primary analytical method. Results: Genetically predicted one standard deviation (SD) increase in EA was causally associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer [odds ratio (OR) 1.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.25, P = 0.003] and a reduced risk of kidney stone (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.62-0.87, P < 0.001) and cystitis (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67-0.86, P < 0.001) after Bonferroni correction.

The top 10 immune terms were selected based on the random forest analysis and used for immune-related risk score (IRS) calculation. Furthermore, we explored differences in clinical and genomic features between high and low IRS groups. An IRS signature based on the 10 immune terms showed high prediction potential for PCa prognosis. Patients in the high IRS group showed significantly higher percentage of immunotherapy response factors, implying that IRS is effective in predicting immunotherapy response rate. Furthermore, consensus clustering was performed to separate the population into three IRSclusters with different clinical outcomes. Patients in IRScluster3 showed the worst prognosis and highest immunotherapy response rate. On the other hand, patients in IRScluster2 showed better prognosis and low immunotherapy response rate. In addition, VGLL3, ANPEP, CD38, CCK, DPYS, CST2, COMP, CRISP3, NKAIN1, and F5 genes were differentially expressed in the three IRSclusters. Furthermore, CMap analysis showed that five compounds targeted IRS signature, thioridazine, trifluoperazine, 0175029-0000, trichostatin A, and fluphenazine.

Cumulative hazard functions for BF and DM were compared with log-rank test and stratified by ISUP group.  Results:   Of 191 patients treated with EBRT+BB, 113 had MTD measurements available. Larger MTD was associated with increased ADT use and seminal vesicle involvement. ROC optimization identified MTD of 24 mm as the optimal cut-point for both BF and DM.

Methods:   The IDF formalism is introduced to quantify contribution from water coordinated by macromolecules to DWI voxel signal based on fundamentally different diffusion constants in vascular capillary, bulk free, and coordinated water compartments. IDF accuracy was studied as a function of b-value set. The IDF scaling with restricted compartment size and polyvinylpirrolidone (PVP) macromolecule concentration was compared to conventional apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and isotropic kurtosis model parameters for a diffusion phantom. An in vivo application was demonstrated for six prostate cancer (PCa) cases with low and high grade lesions annotated from whole mount histopathology.  Results:   IDF linearly scaled with known restricted (vesicular) compartment size and PVP concentration in phantoms and increased with histopathologic score in PCa (from median 9% for atrophy up to 60% for Gleason 7). IDF via non-linear fit was independent of b-value subset selected between b = 0.1 and 2 ms/µm2 , including standard-of-care (SOC) PCa protocol.

The most common causes of CIN include the dysregulation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which is a surveillance mechanism that prevents premature chromosome separation during mitosis by targeting anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). DAB2IP is frequently silenced in advanced prostate cancer (PCa) and is associated with aggressive phenotypes of PCa. Our previous study showed that DAB2IP activates PLK1 and functions in mitotic regulation. Here, we report the novel mitotic phosphorylation of DAB2IP by Cdks, which mediates DAB2IP's interaction with PLK1 and the activation of the PLK1-Mps1 pathway. DAB2IP interacts with Cdc20 in a phosphorylation-independent manner. However, the phosphorylation of DAB2IP inhibits the ubiquitylation of Cdc20 in response to SAC, and blocks the premature release of the APC/C-MCC. The PLK1-Mps1 pathway plays an important role in mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) assembly. It is likely that DAB2IP acts as a scaffold to aid PLK1-Mps1 in targeting Cdc20. Depletion or loss of the Cdks-mediated phosphorylation of DAB2IP destabilizes the MCC, impairs the SAC, and increases chromosome missegregation and subsequent CIN, thus contributing to tumorigenesis. Collectively, these results demonstrate the mechanism of DAB2IP in SAC regulation and provide a rationale for targeting the SAC to cause lethal CIN against DAB2IP-deficient aggressive PCa, which exhibits a weak SAC.""","""['Lan Yu#', 'Yue Lang#', 'Ching-Cheng Hsu#', 'Wei-Min Chen', 'Jui-Chung Chiang', 'Jer-Tsong Hsieh', 'Michael D Story', 'Zeng-Fu Shang', 'Benjamin P C Chen', 'Debabrata Saha']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Tumor suppressor protein DAB2IP participates in chromosomal stability maintenance through activating spindle assembly checkpoint and stabilizing kinetochore-microtubule attachments.', 'Monopolar spindle 1 (MPS1) kinase promotes production of closed MAD2 (C-MAD2) conformer and assembly of the mitotic checkpoint complex.', 'USP9X Limits Mitotic Checkpoint Complex Turnover to Strengthen the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint and Guard against Chromosomal Instability.', 'Mitotic slippage: an old tale with a new twist.', 'Molecular Regulation of the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint by Kinases and Phosphatases.', 'Hippo signaling and histone methylation control cardiomyocyte cell cycle re-entry through distinct transcriptional pathways.', 'Black Phosphorus Quantum Dots Enhance the Radiosensitivity of Human Renal Cell Carcinoma Cells through Inhibition of DNA-PKcs Kinase.']"""

PCa cells have a high tendency to metastasize to various distant organs, and this activity is the main cause of PCa mortality. Nimbolide is a promising phytochemical constituent of neem Azadirachta indica (Meliaceae). Previous studies showed that nimbolide exhibited potent anticancer activity however, its role against PCa tumorigenesis has not been fully elucidated.  Purpose:   Our work aims to explore the role of nimbolide in regulating the essential tumor-associated processes involved in the metastatic cascade in PCa cells.  Study design:   Cytotoxicity assay, wound healing and spheroid invasion assays, western blotting, immunofluorescence, tube-formation assay, in vivo and immunohistochemistry.  Methods:   The cytotoxicity of nimbolide towards PCa cell lines was assessed by resazurin assays. The cell mobility and migration of nimbolide-treated DU145 cells were determined by wound healing and spheroid invasion assays. Tubulin network was visualized using U2OS cells and DU145 cells. The effect of nimbolide on E-cadherin, β-catenin, acetylated α-tubulin and HDAC6 protein expressions levels were measured by Western blot. The potentiality of nimbolide to inhibit angiogenesis was revealed by HUVEC tube-formation assay. Nimbolide antitumor effect was studied in a syngeneic model of murine prostate cancer.  Results:   The current study indicated that nimbolide negatively affected the migratory and invasive capacity of DU145 prostate cancer cells in 2D and three-dimensional (3D) spheroid cultures. Interestingly, nimbolide induced downregulation of E-cadherin without any influence on the expression level of β-catenin. Additionally, we demonstrated that nimbolide influenced the microtubule network which was supported by the upregulation of acetylated α-tubulin and the reduction in HDAC6 protein. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of nimbolide on angiogenesis was clearly observed in HUVEC tube formation assay. In vivo experiments revealed the significant suppression of PCa growth and targeting of the B-RAF/p.ERK signaling pathway by nimbolide.  Conclusion:   Our results showed that nimbolide inhibited 2D and 3D prostate cancer cells migration and downregulated E-cadherin protein expression, a marker for metastatic chemoresistance and tumor recurrence. Nimbolide stabilized the microtubules, combated angiogenesis and suppressed B.RAF/ERK-mediated in vivo tumor growth. Nimbolide may be considered as potential therapeutic agent for metastatic and advanced PCa patients and merits further investigations.""","""['Nuha Mahmoud', 'Mona Dawood', 'Qi Huang', 'Jerome P L Ng', 'Fang Ren', 'Vincent K W Wong', 'Thomas Efferth']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Phytomedicine""","""['Nimbolide-Induced Oxidative Stress Abrogates STAT3 Signaling Cascade and Inhibits Tumor Growth in Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of Mouse Prostate Model.', 'Nimbolide inhibits invasion and migration, and down-regulates uPAR chemokine gene expression, in two breast cancer cell lines.', 'Down-regulation of E-cadherin enhances prostate cancer chemoresistance via Notch signaling.', 'Nimbolide, a Neem Limonoid, Is a Promising Candidate for the Anticancer Drug Arsenal.', 'Anticancer properties of nimbolide and pharmacokinetic considerations to accelerate its development.', 'Targeting PI3K/Akt signaling in prostate cancer therapy.']"""

Recently, we have shown that OXER1 is also a membrane androgen receptor in various cancer tissues. It was reported that the presence of OXER1 in leucocytes and the production and release of 5-oxo-ETE by wounded tissues is a wound sensing mechanism, leading to lymphocyte attraction. In view of the similarity of hallmarks of cancer and wound healing, we have explored the role of OXER1 and its endogenous ligand in the control of cell migration of human cancer epithelial cells (DU-145, T47D and Hep3B), mimicking the activation/migration phase of healing. We show that OXER1 is up-regulated only at the leading edge of the wound and its expression is up-regulated by its ligand 5-oxo-ETE, in a time-related manner. Knock-down of OXER1 or inhibition of 5-oxo-ETE synthesis led to decreased migration of cells and a prolongation of healing, in culture prostate cancer cell monolayers, with a substantial modification of actin cytoskeleton and a decreased filopodia formation. Inhibition of cell migration is a phenomenon mediated by Gβγ OXER1 mediated actions.

A prospective trial was conducted to determine safety, feasibility, and maximal tolerated dose of multilevel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based 5-fraction SABR in patients with HR-PCa.  Methods and materials:   This phase I clinical trial enrolled patients with HR-PCa with grade group ≥4, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≥20 ng/mL, or radiographic ≥T3, and well-defined prostatic lesions on multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) into 4 dose-escalation cohorts. The initial cohort received 47.5 Gy to the prostate, 50 Gy to mpMRI-defined intraprostatic lesion(s), and 22.5 Gy to pelvic lymph nodes in 5 fractions. Radiation doses were escalated for pelvic nodes to 25 Gy and mpMRI lesion(s) to 52.5 Gy and then 55 Gy. Escalation was performed sequentially according to rule-based trial design with 7 to 15 patients per cohort and a 90-day observation period. All men received peri-rectal hydrogel spacer, intraprostatic fiducial placement, and 2 years of androgen deprivation. The primary endpoint was maximal tolerated dose according to a 90-day acute dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate <33%. DLT was defined as National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events ≥grade 3 treatment-related toxicity. Secondary outcomes included acute and delayed gastrointestinal (GI)/genitourinary (GU) toxicity graded with Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events.  Results:   Fifty-five of the 62 enrolled patients were included in the analysis. Dose was escalated through all 4 cohorts without observing any DLTs. Median overall follow-up was 18 months, with a median follow-up of 42, 24, 12, and 7.5 months for cohorts 1 to 4 respectively. Acute and late grade 2 GU toxicities were 25% and 20%, while GI were 13% and 7%, respectively. Late grade 3 GU and GI toxicities were 2% and 0%, respectively.  Conclusions:   SABR dose for HR-PCa was safely escalated with multilevel dose painting of 47.5 Gy to prostate, 55 Gy to mpMRI-defined intraprostatic lesions, and 25 Gy to pelvic nodal region in 5 fractions.

Methods and materials:   To assess the overall uncertainty in stopping-power ratio (SPR) prediction of a DirectSPR implementation calibrated for different patient geometries, the influencing factors were categorized in imaging, modeling as well as others. The respective SPR uncertainty was quantified for lung, soft tissue and bone and translated into range uncertainty for several tumor types. The amount of healthy tissue spared was quantified for 250 patients treated with DirectSPR and the dosimetric impact was evaluated exemplarily for a representative brain-tumor patient.  Results:   For bone, soft tissue and lung, an SPR uncertainty (1σ) of 1.6%, 1.3% and 1.3% was determined for DirectSPR, respectively. This allowed for a reduction of the clinically applied range uncertainty from currently (3.5% + 2 mm) to (1.7% + 2 mm) for brain-tumor and (2.0% + 2 mm) for prostate-cancer patients. The 150 brain-tumor and 100 prostate-cancer patients treated using DirectSPR benefitted from sparing on average 2.6 mm and 4.4 mm of healthy tissue in beam direction, respectively. In the representative patient case, dose reduction in organs at risk close to the target volume was achieved, with a mean dose reduction of up to 16% in the brainstem. Patient-specific DECT-based treatment planning with reduced safety margins was successfully introduced into clinical routine.

We investigated whether an alternative nPSA-based threshold could be used to define post-SBRT BCFs.  Materials and methods:   PSA kinetics data on 2038 patients from 9 institutions were retrospectively analyzed for low- and intermediate-risk PCa patients treated with SBRT without ADT. We evaluated the performance of various nPSA-based definitions. We also investigated the relationship of relative PSA decline (rPSA, PSA18month/PSA6month) and timing of reaching nPSA + 2 with BCF.  Results:   Median follow-up was 71.9 months. BCF occurred in 6.9% of patients. Median nPSA was 0.16 ng/mL. False positivity of nPSA + 2 was 30.2%, compared to 40.9%, 57.8%, and 71.0% for nPSA + 1.5, nPSA + 1.0, and nPSA + 0.5, respectively. Among patients with BCF, the median lead time gained from an earlier nPSA + threshold definition over the Phoenix definition was minimal. Patients with BCF had significantly lower rates of early PSA decline (mean rPSA 1.19 vs. 0.39, p < 0.0001) and were significantly more likely to reach nPSA + 2 ≥ 18 months (83.3% vs. 21.1%, p < 0.0001). The proposed criterion (rPSA ≥ 2.6 or nPSA + 2 ≥ 18 months) had a sensitivity and specificity of 92.4% and 81.5%, respectively, for predicting BCF in patients meeting the Phoenix definition and decreased its false positivity to 6.4%.  Conclusion:   The Phoenix definition remains an excellent definition for BCF post-SBRT.

The diverse mechanisms of progression include fibroblast growth factor (FGF) axis activation.  Objective:   To investigate the molecular and clinical implications of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and its isoforms (α/β) in the pathogenesis of PCa bone metastases.  Design, setting, and participants:   In silico, in vitro, and in vivo preclinical approaches were used. RNA-sequencing and immunohistochemical (IHC) studies in human samples were conducted.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   In mice, bone metastases (chi-square/Fisher's test) and survival (Mantel-Cox) were assessed. In human samples, FGFR1 and ladinin 1 (LAD1) analysis associated with PCa progression were evaluated (IHC studies, Fisher's test).  Results and limitations:   FGFR1 isoform expression varied among PCa subtypes. Intracardiac injection of mice with FGFR1-expressing PC3 cells reduced mouse survival (α, p < 0.0001; β, p = 0.032) and increased the incidence of bone metastases (α, p < 0.0001; β, p = 0.02). Accordingly, IHC studies of human castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) bone metastases revealed significant enrichment of FGFR1 expression compared with treatment-naïve, nonmetastatic primary tumors (p = 0.0007). Expression of anchoring filament protein LAD1 increased in FGFR1-expressing PC3 cells and was enriched in human CRPC bone metastases (p = 0.005).  Conclusions:   FGFR1 expression induces bone metastases experimentally and is significantly enriched in human CRPC bone metastases, supporting its prometastatic effect in PCa. LAD1 expression, found in the prometastatic PCa cells expressing FGFR1, was also enriched in CRPC bone metastases. Our studies support and provide a roadmap for the development of FGFR blockade for advanced PCa.  Patient summary:   We studied the role of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) in prostate cancer (PCa) progression. We found that PCa cells with high FGFR1 expression increase metastases and that FGFR1 expression is increased in human PCa bone metastases, and identified genes that could participate in the metastases induced by FGFR1.

Methods:   A total of 393 DWI images of patients suspected of having prostate cancer (PCa) between January 2019 and December 2020 were collected for model development. Seventy-seven DWI images from another group of PCa patients imaged between January 2021 and April 2021 were collected for temporal validation. Segmentation performance was assessed using the Dice score, positive predictive value (PPV), true positive rate (TPR), and volumetric similarity (VS), Hausdorff distance (HD), the Average distance (AVD), and the Mahalanobis distance (MHD) with manual annotation of pelvic LNs as the reference. The accuracy with which the suspicious metastatic LNs (short diameter > 0.8 cm) were detected was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) at the patient level, and the precision, recall, and F1-score were determined at the lesion level. The consistency of LN staging on an hold-out test dataset between the model and radiologist was assessed using Cohen's kappa coefficient.  Results:   In the testing set used for model development, the Dice score, TPR, PPV, VS, HD, AVD and MHD values for the segmentation of suspicious LNs were 0.85, 0.82, 0.80, 0.86, 2.02 (mm), 2.01 (mm), and 1.54 (mm) respectively. The precision, recall, and F1-score for the detection of suspicious LNs were 0.97, 0.98 and 0.97, respectively. In the temporal validation dataset, the AUC of the model for identifying PCa patients with suspicious LNs was 0.963 (95% CI: 0.892-0.993).

The total portion of PSA (tPSA) can be found in its free form (fPSA), or bound to other proteins forming a stable complex. A heterogeneous sandwich-type UltraMicro Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (UMELISA) has been developed for the measurement of tPSA and fPSA in human serum samples. Strips coated with a high affinity monoclonal antibody (MAb) directed against PSA are used as solid phase, to ensure the specificity of the assay. Biotinylated MAbs specific for tPSA and fPSA ensured sensitivity, given the high affinity binding to streptavidin. The assay was completed in 1.5 h, with a measuring range 0.019-20 µg/L (tPSA), and 0.009-20 µg/L (fPSA). The intra- and inter-assay CV were lower than 9%. Recovery percentages were 96-105%. High correlations were found between the values of the UMELISA PSA standards and the International Reference Standards 96/670 (R2 = 0.9996) and 96/688 (R2 = 0.9989). The assay did not recognize any of the interfering molecules tested. Regression analysis of serum samples showed a good correlation with Roche Elecsys total PSA (n = 631, R2 = 0.986, ρc = 0.992), BioMérieux VIDAS TPSA (n = 631, R2 = 0.989, ρc = 0.993) and Roche Elecsys free PSA (n = 164, R2 = 0.973, ρc = 0.979), all with a relative difference below 15%, and a p < 0.001. A retrospective study of the use of UMELISA PSA in Cuba was carried out. The analytical performance characteristics of UMELISA PSA support its use for the quantification of tPSA and fPSA in human serum samples in a single kit, making it an affordable diagnostic assay available to Cuban Public Health System and developing countries.

Methods:   This study investigated the association between hair dye use and prostate cancer risk in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study cohort, a large, well-characterized cohort of 29,133 male Finnish smokers. Participants completed questionnaires regarding lifestyle, medical, and risk factor information, including the use of hair dye, which was available for 98.8% of the cohort (28,795 men).

In the absence of head-to-head studies, the present study sought to indirectly compare the efficacy and tolerability between these two treatments.  Methods:   This anchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) used patient-level data from the phase 3, randomized, controlled SPARTAN study (apalutamide + ADT), weighted to match aggregate published data from the ARAMIS study (darolutamide + ADT) for clinically relevant baseline measures. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% credible intervals (CrI) were estimated for efficacy endpoints: metastasis-free survival (MFS), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Odds ratios were estimated for tolerability outcomes: adverse events and serious adverse events.  Results:   Before weighting, baseline characteristics from SPARTAN versus ARAMIS were different for median PSA (7.8 vs. 9.2 ng/mL), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 (23% vs. 31%), use of bone-targeted agents (10% vs. 4%), median time from initial diagnosis (94.9 vs. 85.4 months), and proportion of patients from North America (35% vs. 12%) and Europe (50% vs. 64%). After matching (n = 455), our analysis demonstrated that apalutamide + ADT had a Bayesian probability of being more effective than darolutamide + ADT for MFS [98.3%; HR 0.70 (95% CrI 0.51, 0.98)], PSA progression [~ 100%; HR 0.46 (95% CrI 0.33, 0.64)], and PFS [93.2%; HR 0.79 (95% CrI 0.59, 1.08)]. Results for OS and tolerability were similar between apalutamide + ADT and darolutamide + ADT.  Conclusion:   This anchored MAIC analysis of pivotal phase 3 studies in patients with nmCRPC suggests that apalutamide + ADT is more effective than darolutamide + ADT for MFS, progression-free survival (PFS), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression, with a similar OS benefit and tolerability profile.

First-line therapy for prostate cancer includes androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), depriving both the normal and malignant prostate cells of androgens required for proliferation and survival. A significant problem with continuous ADT at the maximum tolerable dose is the insurgence of cancer cell resistance. In recent years, intermittent ADT has been proposed as an alternative to continuous ADT, limiting toxicities and delaying time-to-progression. Several mathematical models with different biological resistance mechanisms have been considered to simulate intermittent ADT response dynamics. We present a comparison between 13 of these intermittent dynamical models and assess their ability to describe prostate-specific antigen (PSA) dynamics. The models are calibrated to longitudinal PSA data from the Canadian Prospective Phase II Trial of intermittent ADT for locally advanced prostate cancer. We perform Bayesian inference and model analysis over the models' space of parameters on- and off-treatment to determine each model's strength and weakness in describing the patient-specific PSA dynamics. Additionally, we carry out a classical Bayesian model comparison on the models' evidence to determine the models with the highest likelihood to simulate the clinically observed dynamics. Our analysis identifies several models with critical abilities to disentangle between relapsing and not relapsing patients, together with parameter intervals where the critical points' basin of attraction might be exploited for clinical purposes. Finally, within the Bayesian model comparison framework, we identify the most compelling models in the description of the clinical data.""","""['S Pasetto', 'H Enderling', 'R A Gatenby', 'R Brady-Nicholls']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Bull Math Biol""","""['EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

A higher CD8+ cell count in the SVI area significantly indicated a favorable prognosis for cancers with SVI (p = 0.004). A lower CD204+ cell count in the SVI area also significantly indicated a favorable prognosis for cancers with SVI (p = 0.004). Furthermore, the combination of the CD8+ and CD204+ cell infiltration ratio of the SVI area to the main tumor area was a significant factor for BCR in the patients with the PCa with SVI (p = 0.001).

Through unsupervised clustering and principal component analyses, we explored metabolic characteristics and constructed a metabolic score for PCa.

Moreover, AR directly upregulates G3BP1 transcription to further amplify G3BP1-SPOP signaling in a feed-forward manner. Our study supports a fundamental role of G3BP1 in disabling the tumor suppressive Cul3SPOP, thus defining a PCa cohort independent of SPOP mutation.

Because of poor resolution, however, the verification of SPECT/CT-based activity distributions is of particular importance. Because of the lack of a ground truth in patient measurements, phantoms are commonly used as a substitute for clinical validation of quantitative SPECT/CT. Because of the time-consuming and erroneous preparation of multicompartment phantoms, such as for the kidney, the usually very complex internal activity distributions are typically replaced by 1- or 2-compartment models. To provide a simplified solution for generating inhomogeneous activity distributions, this work presents a methodology for designing single-compartment phantoms that mimic inhomogeneous spatial activity distributions by using internal filling structures of different volume fractions. Methods: A series of phantoms with different filling structures was designed, 3-dimensionally printed, and measured. After assessing the feasibility of the presented approach in a simple geometry, a set of three patient-specific kidney phantoms was designed on the basis of the contrast-enhanced CT scan of a patient with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Internal gyroid structures of different wall thicknesses were used in the renal medulla and cortex to reproduce the inhomogeneous activity distribution observed in a peritherapeutic SPECT/CT acquisition 24 h after injection of 177Lu-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (apparent activity concentration ratios of 1:1, 1:3.5, and 1:7.5). After 3-dimensional printing, SPECT/CT experiments were performed and the results were compared with the patient data for different reconstruction settings (iterations, subsets, and postfiltering). Results: Good agreement was found between phantom designs and fabricated phantoms (based on high-resolution CT). No internal filling structures were visible in any of the SPECT images, indicating a sufficiently small feature size. Although good visual and quantitative agreement was achieved for certain combinations of filling structure and reconstruction, a histogram analysis indicated an even more complex activity distribution in the patient than represented by the two compartments assumed in our model. Conclusion: The proposed methodology provides patient-specific phantoms mimicking inhomogeneous activity distributions while using a single stock solution, thus simplifying the filling process and reducing uncertainties in the activity determination. This method enables an unprecedented possibility for patient-specific evaluation of radiopharmaceutical uptake, reducing uncertainties in internal dosimetry and individualized treatments.""","""['Anna-Lena Theisen', 'Michael Lassmann', 'Johannes Tran-Gia']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['What You See Is Not What You Get: On the Accuracy of Voxel-Based Dosimetry in Molecular Radiotherapy.', 'Optimizing Image Quantification for 177Lu SPECT/CT Based on a 3D Printed 2-Compartment Kidney Phantom.', 'Design and Fabrication of Kidney Phantoms for Internal Radiation Dosimetry Using 3D Printing Technology.', 'Recent advances on the development of phantoms using 3D printing for imaging with CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, and ultrasound.', 'Recent Developments in SPECT/CT.']"""

Novel local cytoreductive treatments and metastasis-directed therapy are now being evaluated. Such interventions may provide added survival benefit or delay the requirement for further systemic agents and associated toxicity but can confer additional harm. Understanding men's preferences for treatment options in this disease state is crucial for patients, clinicians, carers and future healthcare service providers.  Methods:   Using a prospective, multicentre discrete choice experiment (DCE), we aim to determine the attributes associated with treatment that are most important to men with mHSPC. Furthermore, we plan to determine men's preferences for, and trade-offs between, the attributes (survival and side effects) of different treatment options including systemic therapy, local cytoreductive approaches (external beam radiotherapy, cytoreductive radical prostatectomy or minimally invasive ablative therapy) and metastases-directed therapies (metastasectomy or stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy). All men with newly diagnosed mHSPC within 4 months of commencing ADT and WHO performance status 0-2 are eligible. Men who have previously consented to a cytoreductive treatment or have developed castrate-resistant disease will be excluded. This study includes a qualitative analysis component, with patients (n=15) and healthcare professionals (n=5), to identify and define the key attributes associated with treatment options that would warrant trade-off evaluation in a DCE.

PSM was defined as the presence of cancer adjacent to inked surface of the specimen and categorized into four groups based on locations: apex, posterolateral, base, and multifocal. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the predictors of overall and location-specific PSM.  Results:   The overall PSM rate was 133/393 (34%). The PSM rates for pT2, pT3, and pT4 stage were 63/278 (23%), 50/89 (56%), and 20/26 (77%), respectively. The estimated rates for apical, posterolateral, basal, and multifocal PSM were 8%, 4%, 7%, and 14%, respectively. In univariate analysis, overall PSM related to tPSA, f/tPSA, percentage of positive needles, and Gleason score. Multifocal PSM correlated with smoking history, drinking history, tPSA, f/tPSA, percentage of positive needles, and Gleason score.

Objective:   To assess the association between treatment approach, functional outcomes, and patient expectations and treatment-related regret among patients with localized prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   This population-based, prospective cohort study used 5 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-based registries in the Comparative Effectiveness Analysis of Surgery and Radiation cohort. Participants included men with clinically localized prostate cancer from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2012. Data were analyzed from August 2, 2020, to March 1, 2021.  Exposures:   Prostate cancer treatments included surgery, radiotherapy, and active surveillance.  Main outcomes and measures:   Patient-reported treatment-related regret using validated metrics. Regression models were adjusted for demographic and clinicopathologic characteristics, treatment approach, and patient-reported functional outcomes.  Results:   Among the 2072 men included in the analysis (median age, 64 [IQR, 59-69] years), treatment-related regret at 5 years after diagnosis was reported in 183 patients (16%) undergoing surgery, 76 (11%) undergoing radiotherapy, and 20 (7%) undergoing active surveillance. Compared with active surveillance and adjusting for baseline differences, active treatment was associated with an increased likelihood of regret for those undergoing surgery (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.40 [95% CI, 1.44-4.01]) but not radiotherapy (aOR, 1.53 [95% CI, 0.88-2.66]). When mediation by patient-reported functional outcomes was considered, treatment modality was not independently associated with regret. Sexual dysfunction, but not other patient-reported functional outcomes, was significantly associated with regret (aOR for change in sexual function from baseline, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.52-0.81]). Subjective patient-perceived treatment efficacy (aOR, 5.40 [95% CI, 2.15-13.56]) and adverse effects (aOR, 5.83 [95% CI, 3.97-8.58]), compared with patient expectations before treatment, were associated with treatment-related regret. Other patient characteristics at the time of treatment decision-making, including participatory decision-making tool scores (aOR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.69-0.92]), social support (aOR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.67-0.90]), and age (aOR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.62-0.97]), were significantly associated with regret. Results were comparable when assessing regret at 3 years rather than 5 years.  Conclusions and relevance:   The findings of this cohort study suggest that more than 1 in 10 patients with localized prostate cancer experience treatment-related regret. The rates of regret appear to differ between treatment approaches in a manner that is mediated by functional outcomes and patient expectations. Treatment preparedness that focuses on expectations and treatment toxicity and is delivered in the context of shared decision-making should be the subject of future research to examine whether it can reduce regret.""","""['Christopher J D Wallis', 'Zhiguo Zhao', 'Li-Ching Huang', 'David F Penson', 'Tatsuki Koyama', 'Sherrie H Kaplan', 'Sheldon Greenfield', 'Amy N Luckenbaugh', 'Zachary Klaassen', 'Ralph Conwill', 'Michael Goodman', 'Ann S Hamilton', 'Xiao-Cheng Wu', 'Lisa E Paddock', 'Antoinette Stroup', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Mia Hashibe', ""Brock B O'Neil"", 'Karen E Hoffman', 'Daniel A Barocas']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""JAMA Oncol""","""['Decisional Regret Among Men With Prostate Cancer: What Is Involved?', 'Patient-Reported Outcomes Through 5 Years for Active Surveillance, Surgery, Brachytherapy, or External Beam Radiation With or Without Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Association Between Radiation Therapy, Surgery, or Observation for Localized Prostate Cancer and Patient-Reported Outcomes After 3 Years.', 'Treatment Decision Regret Among Long-Term Survivors of Localized Prostate Cancer: Results From the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study.', 'Why do patients regret their prostate cancer treatment?

We demonstrate that, even though snail family transcriptional repressor 2 (SNAI2) is frequently amplified in prostate cancer, it is epigenetically silenced in this disease, with dynamic changes in SNAI2 levels showing distinct clinical relevance. Integrative clinical data from 18 prostate cancer cohorts and experimental evidence showed that gene fusion between transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and ETS transcription factor ERG (ERG) (TMPRSS2-ERG fusion) is involved in the silencing of SNAI2. We created a silencer score to evaluate epigenetic repression of SNAI2, which can be reversed by treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and histone deacetylase inhibitors. Silencing of SNAI2 facilitated tumor cell proliferation and luminal differentiation. Furthermore, SNAI2 has a major influence on the tumor microenvironment by reactivating tumor stroma and creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment in prostate cancer.

Most PCa cases develop into castration‑resistant PCa (CRPC) within 2 years. At present, the molecular mechanisms of the occurrence and development of PCa and its transformation to CRPC remain unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the role of CKLF‑like Marvel transmembrane domain containing family member 5 (CMTM5) in PCa and its molecular mechanism in vitro. PCa tissues and paired adjacent normal prostate tissues from 70 patients were collected to examine the expression levels of CMTM5 and EGFR via immunohistochemistry, reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR and western blotting. Then, CMTM5‑overexpressing DU145 cells were constructed, and CMTM5 expression in these transfected cells and vector control cells was examined via western blotting. Cell Counting Kit‑8 and plate clone formation assays were used to evaluate the proliferation and colony number of CMTM5‑overexpressing cells and vector control cells. Then, cell migration and invasion were assessed using wound healing assay, Transwell assay and immunofluorescence analysis with DAPI staining. The effect of CMTM5 on apoptosis and its underlying molecular mechanism were examined using western blotting and flow cytometry. The results demonstrated that CMTM5 expression in PCa tissues and cell lines was significantly downregulated, while EFGR expression was significantly upregulated. The proportion of high CMTM5 expression in PCa tissues was significantly lower compared with that in normal prostate tissues. By contrast, the proportion of high EGFR expression in PCa tissues was significantly increased compared with that in normal prostate tissues. Moreover, CMTM5 overexpression significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and promoted cell apoptosis compared with vector control cells in vitro. Furthermore, the regulation of PCa by CMTM5 was associated with the downregulation of PI3K/AKT and its downstream Bcl‑2 expression, as well as the upregulation of Bax expression. In conclusion, CMTM5 may be an effective tumor suppressor gene for PCa, especially for castration‑resistant PCa, by downregulating EGFR and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway components.""","""['Linjin Li#', 'Yiren Hu#', 'Dake Chen', 'Jianlong Zhu', 'Wenshuo Bao', 'Xiaomin Xu', 'Heyi Chen', 'Wu Chen', 'Rui Feng']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['CMTM5 is reduced in prostate cancer and inhibits cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo.', 'Expression and significance of CMTM5 and epidermal growth factor receptor in prostate cancer.', 'CMTM5 inhibits the tumor cell behavior of prostate cancer by downregulation of HER2.', 'Research advances in CKLF-like MARVEL transmembrane domain containing member 5.', 'The role of PIP5K1A in cancer development and progression.', 'Significance of EGFR investigation in odontogenic keratocyst: a narrative review.', 'Targeting PI3K/Akt signaling in prostate cancer therapy.']"""

For prostate cancer, previous studies suggest a beneficial role of specific plant-based foods (e.g., tomatoes) and a potentially harmful role of specific animal-based foods (e.g., meat, dairy). However, less is known about plant-based dietary patterns.  Objectives:   We sought to examine the relation between plant-based diet indices and prostate cancer risk, including clinically relevant disease.  Methods:   This was a prospective cohort study including 47,239 men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (1986-2014). Overall and healthful plant-based diet indices were calculated from FFQs. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate HRs and 95% CIs to examine the risk of incident prostate cancer (total and by clinical category), among men ages <65 and ≥65 y.  Results:   Of the 47,239 men, 6655 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer over follow-up, including 515 with advanced-stage disease at diagnosis, 956 with lethal disease (metastasis or death), and 806 prostate cancer deaths. Greater overall plant-based consumption was associated with a significantly lower risk of fatal prostate cancer (HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.64, 1.01; P-trend = 0.04). In men aged <65, a higher plant-based diet index was associated with a lower risk of advanced, lethal, and fatal prostate cancer. Moreover, greater consumption of a healthful plant-based diet was associated with lower risks of total (HR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.73, 0.98; P-trend = 0.046) and lethal prostate cancer (HR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.94; P-trend = 0.03) at age <65. There were no associations between overall or healthful plant-based diet indices with prostate cancer among men ≥65 y. Fewer than 1% of participants followed a strict vegetarian or vegan diet.  Conclusions:   This prospective study provides supportive evidence that greater consumption of healthful plant-based foods is associated with a lower risk of aggressive forms of prostate cancer, with stronger benefit among men aged <65 y.""","""['Stacy Loeb', 'Benjamin C Fu', 'Scott R Bauer', 'Claire H Pernar', 'June M Chan', 'Erin L Van Blarigan', 'Edward L Giovannucci', 'Stacey A Kenfield', 'Lorelei A Mucci']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Am J Clin Nutr""","""['Urological Oncology: Prostate Cancer.', 'Plant-based diets and incident metabolic syndrome: Results from a South Korean prospective cohort study.', 'Changes in Plant-Based Diet Quality and Total and Cause-Specific Mortality.', 'Plant-Based Diets and Incident CKD and Kidney Function.', 'Systematic review of the impact of a plant-based diet on prostate cancer incidence and outcomes.', 'Dietary Patterns and All-Cause Mortality: A Systematic Review Internet.', 'Enhancing the Anticancer and Anti-Inflammatory Properties of Curcumin in Combination with Quercetin, for the Prevention and Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Combination of Lycopene and Curcumin Synergistically Alleviates Testosterone-Propionate-Induced Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia in Sprague Dawley Rats via Modulating Inflammation and Proliferation.', 'Association of Plant-Based Diet Indices and Abdominal Obesity with Mental Disorders among Older Chinese Adults.', 'Associations of healthful and unhealthful plant-based diets with plasma markers of cardiometabolic risk.', 'Plant-based dietary patterns and the risk of digestive system cancers in 3 large prospective cohort studies.']"""

Tumor metastasis is one of the primary reasons for the poor prognosis of CRC patients. However, the mechanism underlying CRC metastasis is still unclear. Myosin 1B (MYO1B) is important for cell migration and motility and is part of the myosin superfamily that contains various myosins. Studies of prostate, cervical, and head and neck cancer have revealed preliminary findings concerning the effect of MYO1B on tumor metastasis. However, the role of MYO1B in CRC metastasis, as well as its underlying mechanism, remains unknown.  Methods:   Quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemical staining methods were used to analyze the expression of MYO1B in human CRC and normal mucosa tissues. Lentivirus vector-based MYO1B oligonucleotides and short hairpin RNA (shRNA) were used to examine the functional relevance of MYO1B in CRC cells. Co-immunoprecipitation, western blotting, and immunofluorescence assays were used to investigate the underlying mechanism of MYO1B-mediated cell migration.  Results:   The expression of MYO1B was increased in most CRC tissues and was positively associated with a greater risk of tumor metastasis and poor prognosis for patients. MYO1B was significantly associated with the migration and invasion properties of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. MYO1B promoted F-actin rearrangement through the ROCK2/LIMK/Cofilin axis by enhancing the activation of RhoA. MYO1B also promoted the assembly of focal adhesions by targeting RhoA.  Conclusions:   MYO1B plays a vital role in CRC metastasis by promoting the activation of RhoA. MYO1B may not only be a valid biomarker for predicting the risk of metastasis and poor prognosis in CRC but may also be a potential therapeutic target for patients with a high risk of tumor metastasis.""","""['Lang Xie#', 'Hongyun Huang#', 'Zheng Zheng', 'Qian Yang', 'Shubo Wang', 'Yaoxu Chen', 'Jinlong Yu', 'Chunhui Cui']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Ann Transl Med""","""['Myo1b promotes tumor progression and angiogenesis by inhibiting autophagic degradation of HIF-1α in colorectal cancer.', 'Myosin 1b promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in cervical cancer.', 'Myosin 1b promotes migration, invasion and glycolysis in cervical cancer via ERK/HIF-1α pathway.', 'Aberrant Myosin 1b Expression Promotes Cell Migration and Lymph Node Metastasis of HNSCC.', 'ROCK isoforms differentially modulate cancer cell motility by mechanosensing the substrate stiffness.', 'Intracellular Vimentin Regulates the Formation of Classical Swine Fever Virus Replication Complex through Interaction with NS5A Protein.', 'lncRNA BANCR promotes the colorectal cancer metastasis through accelerating exosomes-mediated M2 macrophage polarization via regulating RhoA/ROCK signaling.', 'Dahuang-Taoren, a botanical drug combination, ameliorates adenomyosis via inhibiting Rho GTPases.', 'Myo1b promotes tumor progression and angiogenesis by inhibiting autophagic degradation of HIF-1α in colorectal cancer.', 'Comprehensive Landscape of Prognostic Significance and Immune Characteristics of Myosins in Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck.']"""

Recent data suggest they have similar efficacy but a different safety profile in the first-line mCRPC setting.  Objective:   To assess patient preference between docetaxel and cabazitaxel among men who received one or more doses of each taxane and did not experience progression after the first taxane.  Design, setting, and participants:   Chemotherapy-naïve patients with mCRPC were randomized 1:1 to receive docetaxel (75 mg/m2 every 3 wk × 4 cycles) followed by cabazitaxel (25 mg/m2 every 3 wk × 4 cycles) or the reverse sequence. Randomization was stratified by prior abiraterone or enzalutamide use.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary endpoint was patient preference, assessed via a dedicated questionnaire after the second taxane. Secondary endpoints included reasons for patient preference, prostate-specific antigen response, radiological progression-free survival, and overall survival. This clinical trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT02044354.  Results and limitations:   Of 195 men randomized, 152 met the prespecified modified intent-to-treat criteria for analysis. Overall, 66 patients (43%) preferred cabazitaxel, 40 (27%) preferred docetaxel, and 46 (30%) had no preference (p = 0.004, adjusted for treatment period effect). More patients preferred treatment period 1 (43%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 36-52%) versus period 2 (27%, 95% CI 20-34%). Patient preference for cabazitaxel was mainly related to less fatigue (72%), better quality of life (64%), and other adverse events (hair loss, pain, nail disorders, edema). Adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of each drug.  Conclusions:   A significantly higher proportion of chemotherapy-naïve men with mCRPC who received both taxanes preferred cabazitaxel over docetaxel. Less fatigue and better quality of life were the two main reasons driving patient choice.

The reason is that miRNAs are involved in many important biological processes and it is tremendously expensive and time-consuming to do biological experiments to verify miRNA-disease associations.  Methods:   In this paper, we proposed a new method to infer miRNA-disease associations using collaborative filtering and resource allocation algorithms on a miRNA-disease-lncRNA tripartite graph. It combined the collaborative filtering algorithm in CFNBC model to solve the problem of imbalanced data and the method for association prediction established multiple types of known associations among multiple objects presented in TPGLDA model.  Results:   The experimental results showed that our proposed method achieved a reliable performance with Area Under Roc Curve (AUC) and Area Under Precision-Recall Curve (AUPR) values of 0.9788 and 0.9373, respectively, under fivefold-cross-validation experiments. It outperformed than some other previous methods such as DCSMDA and TPGLDA. Furthermore, it demonstrated the ability to derive new associations between miRNAs and diseases among 8, 19 and 14 new associations out of top 40 predicted associations in case studies of Prostatic Neoplasms, Heart Failure, and Glioma diseases, respectively. All of these new predicted associations have been confirmed by recent literatures. Besides, it could discover new associations for new diseases (or miRNAs) without any known associations as demonstrated in the case study of Open-angle glaucoma disease.  Conclusion:   With the reliable performance to infer new associations between miRNAs and diseases as well as to discover new associations for new diseases (or miRNAs) without any known associations, our proposed method can be considered as a powerful tool to infer miRNA-disease associations.""","""['Van Tinh Nguyen', 'Thi Tu Kien Le', 'Tran Quoc Vinh Nguyen', 'Dang Hung Tran']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BMC Med Genomics""","""['A novel collaborative filtering model for LncRNA-disease association prediction based on the Naïve Bayesian classifier.', 'Predicting miRNA-disease associations using improved random walk with restart and integrating multiple similarities.', 'Prediction of microRNA-disease associations based on distance correlation set.', 'DeepWalk based method to predict lncRNA-miRNA associations via lncRNA-miRNA-disease-protein-drug graph.', 'Research progress of miRNA-disease association prediction and comparison of related algorithms.']"""

Differences in oncological outcome and AEs were evaluated between three treatment groups: ADT only (N=26) - ADT + AAP (N=48) - ADT + docetaxel (N=19). Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier statistics.  Results:   Median RPFS was 13 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 9-17) for ADT only, 21 months (95% CI: 19-23) for ADT + AAP and 12 months (95% CI: 11-14) for ADT + docetaxel (p = 0.004).

Patients were excluded if they had an International Prostate Symptom Score <13, a maximum urinary flow rate >15 mL/s or presence of prostate cancer, bladder stone, urethral stricture, neurogenic bladder, or previous prostate surgery. The primary outcome was hemoglobin loss. The analysis was intention-to-treat. Postoperative findings (36 months) were compared to baseline characteristics. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were performed for risk factors predicting hemoglobin loss or operative time in all patients.  Results:   There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics between the two groups. Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate was associated with significantly better operative time (P = 0.019), operative efficiency (P < 0.001), hemoglobin loss (P < 0.001), catheterization duration (P < 0.001) and hospital stay (P < 0.001) compared to bipolar transurethral resection of prostate. Both procedures were safe, with no significant difference in total complications (P = 0.128). Blood transfusion (P = 0.026) and capsular perforation (P = 0.239) were reported only in the bipolar transurethral resection of the prostate group. There was no significant difference in rates of urinary tract infections (P = 0.714), urethral strictures (P = 0.359), or transient stress incontinence (P = 0.717).

Methods:   We used multistate Markov simulation models to generate cohorts 65 years of age and free of cancer and dementia at baseline; follow-up for incident cancer (all cancers, breast, prostate, and lung cancer), dementia, dementia diagnosis among those with dementia, and death occurred monthly over 30 years. Models specified no true effect of cancer on dementia, and used age-specific transition rates calibrated to U.S. population and cohort data. We varied the average lapse between dementia onset and diagnosis, including nondifferential and differential delays by cancer history, and examined observed incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for the effect of cancer on dementia diagnosis.  Results:   Nondifferential dementia diagnosis delay introduced minimal bias (IRRs = 0.98-1.02) for all cancer, breast, and prostate models and substantial bias (IRR = 0.78) in lung cancer models. For the differential dementia diagnosis delay model of all cancer types combined, simulation scenarios with ≥20% lower dementia diagnosis rate (additional 4.5-month delay) in those with cancer history versus without yielded results consistent with literature estimates. Longer dementia diagnosis delays in those with cancer and higher mortality in those with cancer and dementia yielded more bias.  Conclusions:   Delays in dementia diagnosis may play a role in the inverse cancer-dementia relationship, especially for more fatal cancers, but moderate differential delays in those with cancer were needed to fully explain the literature-reported IRRs.""","""['Eleanor Hayes-Larson', 'Crystal Shaw', 'Sarah F Ackley', 'Scott C Zimmerman', 'M Maria Glymour', 'Rebecca E Graff', 'John S Witte', 'Lindsay C Kobayashi', 'Elizabeth Rose Mayeda']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci""","""['The competing risk of death and selective survival cannot fully explain the inverse cancer-dementia association.', 'Evaluation of Selective Survival and Sex/Gender Differences in Dementia Incidence Using a Simulation Model.', 'Dietary Patterns and Breast, Colorectal, Lung, and Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review Internet.', ""Risk of Alzheimer's disease or dementia following a cancer diagnosis."", ""Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia and other dementias in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)."", ""Investigation of Shared Genetic Risk Factors Between Parkinson's Disease and Cancers."", 'Cancer and Vascular Comorbidity Effects on Dementia Risk and Neuropathology in the Oldest-Old.']"""

However, it remains unknown if there is any association between these 2 outcomes. In this secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial, we investigated the association of short-term changes in patient-reported outcome with long-term event-free survival (EFS) and metastasis-free survival (MFS) in localized PCa.  Methods and materials:   Localized PCa patients with a Gleason score ≤7, clinical stage T1b to T3a, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <30 ng/mL were randomized to neoadjuvant and concurrent androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for 6 months starting 4 months before prostate radiation therapy or concurrent and adjuvant ADT for 6 months starting simultaneously with radiation therapy. Patient-reported symptom burden was evaluated using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire (QLQ)-PR.25. Clinically meaningful deterioration (CMD) was defined as a ≥10-point worsening at any time within 10 months postrandomization regardless of subsequent improvement. Landmark analyses were performed to determine the association of CMD of urinary and bowel symptoms separately with EFS and MFS in patients who responded to the baseline questionnaire, were alive, and were event free at 10 months.  Results:   Overall, 393 patients had responded to the baseline QLQ. One patient died, and 1 patient had failure within 10 months. Therefore, 391 patients were eligible for the landmark analyses. After adjusting for age, Gleason score, PSA, performance status, and treatment group, CMD of urinary symptoms was associated with worse EFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-2.65) and MFS (HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.11-2.57). Considering deaths as competing events, CMD of urinary symptoms was associated with a significant increase in the relative incidence of progression (subdistribution HR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.12-5.20). However, no association was found between CMD of bowel symptoms and EFS or MFS.  Conclusions:   In this study, short-term CMD of urinary symptoms was associated with significantly inferior EFS and MFS and an increase in the relative incidence of progression. Further investigations are needed to explore the biological rationale of such association in the context of ADT and radiation therapy.""","""['Soumyajit Roy', 'Daniel E Spratt', 'Scott C Morgan', 'Michael Zhou', ""Leah A D'Souza"", 'Fletcher Drogos', 'Julia Malone', 'Scott Grimes', 'Christopher Gualano', 'Robert MacRae', 'Dibya Mukherjee', 'Shawn Malone']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Patient-Reported Outcomes From a Phase 3 Randomized Controlled Trial Exploring Optimal Sequencing of Short-Term Androgen Deprivation Therapy With Prostate Radiation Therapy in Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate Radiotherapy With Adjuvant Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) Improves Metastasis-Free Survival Compared to Neoadjuvant ADT: An Individual Patient Meta-Analysis.', 'Association of Baseline Patient-reported Health-related Quality of Life Metrics with Outcome in Localised Prostate Cancer.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

When compared with acinar adenocarcinoma, it is characterized by an increased biochemical recurrence rate and unusual metastasis sites. The purpose of the present study was to further elucidate the genomic alterations associated with PDA. Methods: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) and linkage analyses were performed on genomic DNA isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples obtained from eleven PDA tumors and paired benign tissues. The profiles of somatic mutations, indels as well as copy-number alterations were confirmed in PDA patients. The clonal evolution patterns of the eleven PDA cases were compared with the data obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for eight primary prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma patients. Results: The same somatic changes were observed in PDA as in advanced and/or metastatic acinar adenocarcinomas. For example, the mutations of a known prostate cancer driver gene CDKN1A, were the most significant events among 17% of tumors. In addition to the known amplification of chromosomes 1q, 4p, 8q, and 14q, the copy number of several large regions also increased significantly. The origin of PDA was heterogeneous: some patients (e.g. P5) were consistent with the monoclonal model, while others (e.g. P7) were polyclonal. Conclusions: PDA and acinar adenocarcinomas of prostate with high Gleason score have similar mutational profiles.

Material and methods:   The retrospective study included 20 prostate cancer patients treated with 40 Gy total dose over five fractions (8 Gy/fraction) using VMAT. Daily cone beam computed tomography images were acquired before the delivery of every fraction and then, with the application of deformable image registration used for the estimation of daily dose, contouring and plan re-optimization. Dosimetric benefits of the various ART strategies were quantified by the comparison of dose and dose-volume metrics derived from treatment planning objectives for original treatment plan and adapted plans with the consideration of target volumes (PTV and CTV) as well as critical structures (bladder, rectum, left, and right femoral heads).  Results:   Percentage difference (ΔD) between planning objectives and delivered dose in the D99% > 4000cGy (CTV) metric was -3.9% for the non-ART plan and 2.1% to 4.1% for ART plans. For D99% > 3800cGy and Dmax < 4280cGy (PTV), ΔD was -11.2% and -6.5% for the non-ART plan as well as -3.9% to -1.6% and -0.2% to 1.8% for ART plans, respectively. For D15% < 3200 cGy and D20% < 2800 cGy (bladder), ΔD was -62.4% and -68.8% for the non-ART plan as well as -60.0% to -57.4% and -67.0% to -64.0% for ART plans.

However, its role in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains largely unknown. Based on data from an online database, a significant decline in lncRNA PCAT18 was observed in patients with TNBC subtype compared to a population with normal breast tissue. Patients with TNBC with high PCAT18 levels presented good outcomes. Patients with TNBC with high PCAT18 had a lower rate of lymph node-positive metastasis than those with low PCAT18. PCAT18-upregulation inhibited, while PCAT18-downregulation promoted, migration and expression of matrix metalloproteinases 9/2 (MMP9/MMP2) and uridylyl phosphate adenosine (uPA) in TNBC cells. Activating transcription factor 7 (ATF7) was positively associated with PCAT18, and ATF7-inhibition abrogated the anti-migration effects of PCAT18 on TNBC cells. Mechanistically, miR-103a-3p directly targeted and inhibited ATF7 expression. PCAT18 competitively sponges miR-103a-3p, promoting the expression of ATF7. Exogenous PCAT18 was associated with lower incidence of lung metastasis followed by the upregulation of ATF7, which was prevented by the treatment of miR-103a-3p mimics. Collectively, PCAT18 was expressed at low levels in TNBC, and PCAT18 could sponge miR-103a-3p and promote ATF7 expression, resulting in prevention of TNBC metastasis.

However, even with the robotic surgery advantages, functional outcomes following RARP, especially erection recovery, still challenge surgeons and patients (2, 3). In this scenario, we have described different ways and grades of neurovascular bundle preservation (NVB) using the prostatic artery as a landmark until our most recent technique with lateral prostatic fascia preservation and modified apical dissection (4-6). In this video compilation, we have illustrated the anatomical and technical details of different grades of NVB preservation.  Surgical technique:   After the anterior and posterior bladder neck dissection, we lift the prostate by the seminal vesicles to access the posterior aspect of the prostate. Then, we incise the Denonvilliers layers and work between an avascular plane to release the posterior NVB from 5 to 1 and 7 to 11 o'clock positions on the right and left sides, respectively6. In sequence, we access the prostate anteriorly by incising the endopelvic fascia bilaterally (close to the prostate) until communicating the anterior and posterior planes. Finally, we control the prostatic pedicles with Hem-o-lok clips and then proceed for the apical dissection preserving the maximum amount of urethra length and periurethral tissues. Considerations: Potency recovery following radical prostatectomy remains a challenge due to its multifactorial etiology. However, basic concepts for nerve-sparing are crucial to achieving optimal outcomes, such as minimizing the amount of traction used on dissection, avoiding excessive cautery, and neural preservation based on anatomical landmarks (arteries and planes of dissection).""","""['Marcio Covas Moschovas', 'Vipul Patel']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int Braz J Urol""","""['Technical and anatomical challenges to approach robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy in patients with Urolift®.', 'Modified Apical Dissection and Lateral Prostatic Fascia Preservation Improves Early Postoperative Functional Recovery in Robotic-assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy: Results from a Propensity Score-matched Analysis.', 'Anatomic nerve-sparing laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: comparison of retrograde and antegrade techniques.', 'Neurovascular bundle preservation in robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: How I do it after 15.000 cases.', 'Current status of various neurovascular bundle-sparing techniques in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Simultaneous hernia repair following robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy is safe with low rates of mesh-related complications.', 'Comparison between intra- and postoperative outcomes of the da Vinci SP and da Vinci Xi robotic platforms in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.', 'Technical and anatomical challenges to approach robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy in patients with Urolift®.', 'Implementation and outcomes of Hugo(TM) RAS System in robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Comparing the outcomes of robotic assisted radical prostatectomy in black and white men: Experience of a high-volume center.']"""

Independent center 2 cases (n = 296) that included pathology outcome (systematic and MRI targeted biopsy) were used to compute performance for radiologists and DL. The performance of detecting PI-RADS 4-5 and Gleason > 6 lesions was assessed on 782 unseen cases (486 center 1, 296 center 2) using free-response ROC (FROC) and ROC analysis.  Results:   The DL sensitivity for detecting PI-RADS ≥ 4 lesions was 87% (193/223, 95% CI: 82-91) at an average of 1 false positive (FP) per patient, and an AUC of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.84-0.91). The DL sensitivity for the detection of Gleason > 6 lesions was 85% (79/93, 95% CI: 77-83) @ 1 FP compared to 91% (85/93, 95% CI: 84-96) @ 0.3 FP for a consensus panel of expert radiologists. Data size and prior zonal knowledge significantly affected performance (4%, [Formula: see text]).  Conclusion:   PI-RADS-trained DL can accurately detect and localize Gleason > 6 lesions. DL could reach expert performance using substantially more than 2000 training cases, and DL zonal segmentation.  Key points:   • AI for prostate MRI analysis depends strongly on data size and prior zonal knowledge. • AI needs substantially more than 2000 training cases to achieve expert performance.""","""['Matin Hosseinzadeh', 'Anindo Saha', 'Patrick Brand', 'Ilse Slootweg', 'Maarten de Rooij', 'Henkjan Huisman']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Head-to-head comparison of biparametric versus multiparametric MRI of the prostate before robot-assisted transperineal fusion prostate biopsy.', 'Predicting clinically significant prostate cancer with a deep learning approach: a multicentre retrospective study.', 'A concurrent, deep learning-based computer-aided detection system for prostate multiparametric MRI: a performance study involving experienced and less-experienced radiologists.', 'Positive Predictive Value of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2 for the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Artificial Intelligence in Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: Where Do We Stand in 2021?', 'Application of a validated prostate MRI deep learning system to independent same-vendor multi-institutional data: demonstration of transferability.', 'Anatomically guided self-adapting deep neural network for clinically significant prostate cancer detection on bi-parametric MRI: a multi-center study.', 'Deep learning-assisted knee osteoarthritis automatic grading on plain radiographs: the value of multiview X-ray images and prior knowledge.', 'A review and comparative study of cancer detection using machine learning: SBERT and SimCSE application.', 'Does deep learning software improve the consistency and performance of radiologists with various levels of experience in assessing bi-parametric prostate MRI?']"""

Understanding factors that influence radiation exposure is crucial in effective patient selection and procedural planning.  Methods:   Data were collected retrospectively for 352 consecutive PAE procedures from January 2015 to June 2020 at the three centers. Dose area product (DAP (Gy·cm2)) was selected as the primary outcome measure of radiation exposure. Multiple patient- and procedure-related explanatory variables were collected and correlated with the outcome variable. A multiple linear regression model was built to determine significant predictors of increased or decreased radiation exposure as reflected by DAP.  Results:   There was considerable variation in DAP between the centers. Intended unilateral PAE (p = 0.03) and each 10 additional patients treated (p = 0.02) were significant predictors of decreased DAP. Conversely, increased patient body mass index (BMI, p < 0.001), fluoroscopy time (p < 0.001), and number of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) acquisitions (p < 0.001) were significant predictors of increased DAP.  Conclusions:   To minimize patient radiation exposure during PAE radiologists may, in collaboration with clinicians, consider unilateral embolization, pre-interventional CTA for procedure planning, using predominantly anteroposterior (AP) projections, and limiting the use of cone-beam CT (CBCT) and fluoroscopy.  Key points:   • Growing center experience and intended unilateral embolization decrease patient radiation exposure during prostatic artery embolization. • Patient BMI, fluoroscopy time, and number of DSA acquisitions are associated with increased DAP during procedures. • Large variation in radiation exposure between the centers may reflect the use of CTA before and CBCT during the procedure.""","""['Petra Svarc', 'Thijs Hagen', 'Hanne Waltenburg', 'Christian Andersson', 'Mats Bläckberg', 'Eduard Baco', 'Mikkel Taudorf', 'Martin Andreas Røder', 'Hans Lindgren', 'Nils-Einar Kløw', 'Lars Birger Lönn']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Radiation Dose in Prostatic Artery Embolization Using Cone-Beam CT and 3D Roadmap Software.', ""Influence of Interventionists' Experience on Radiation Exposure of Patients Who Underwent Prostate Artery Embolization: 4-Year Results from a Retrospective, Single-Center Study."", 'Prostatic Artery Embolization: Influence of Cone-Beam Computed Tomography on Radiation Exposure, Procedure Time, and Contrast Media Use.', 'Radiodermitis after prostatic artery embolization: case report and review of the literature.', 'Rare Prostatic Artery Origins and the Importance of Collateral Circulation\xa0in Prostate Artery Embolization: A Pictorial Essay.', 'Prostatic Artery Embolization: An Update.', 'A Retrospective, Single-Center Study of Technical-Procedural Factors Affecting Radiation Dose During Prostatic Artery Embolization.']"""

Methods:   2D, 3D, and serum-free suspension culture system were used to study LPS-induced malignant transformation in series malignant grade of prostate cancer (PCa) epithelial cells. Flow cytometry assay and RT-PCR were utilized to evaluate the CD44+CD133+ stem cell population, the expression of inflammatory cytokines and series tumor stemness biomarkers. Meanwhile, Western blot was used to analyze the alteration of cell signaling associated-molecules by treatment with TSA, an original antifungal antibiotic and a panel inhibitor of histone deacetylase.  Results:   Our study found that LPS promoted the migration, invasion and stem-like tumoroshpere forming in multiple PCa cell lines including DU145, PC3, 22RV1, LNCaP. LPS also enriched CD44+CD133+ stem cell population and increased the expression of series tumor stemness biomarkers (e.g., CD44, CD133, SOX-2, α-intergrin, Nestin, etc.). TSA was found to prevent tumor cell migration, invasion and tumorosphere forming in DU145 and PC3 cells with increasing tumor suppressive Maspin and reducing both phosphorylation of Stat3 (p-Stat3) and pro-oncogene c-Myc expression in LPS-treated DU145 cells. Furthermore, blocking Stat3 signaling pathway by treatment with TSA and/or small molecule compound Stattic of an p-Stat3 inhibitor effectively abrogated LPS-induced tumorosphere forming with decrease of IL-6, IL-8 and stemness biomarkers CD44, SOX-2 expression.  Conclusion:   Our data demonstrated that the inflammatory agent of bacterial LPS augmented malignant transformation and promoted the cancerous stemness in PCa epithelial cells. TSA could prevent, at least in part, the LPS-induced malignant transformation by targeting p-Stat3/c-Myc signaling pathway and reducing inflammatory IL-6, IL-8.

Previous studies suggested that NDRG1 is linked to the androgen signaling network, but this mechanistic relationship is unclear. Considering the crucial role of the androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer (PCa) progression, here we examined for the first time the effect of NDRG1 on AR expression, activation, and downstream signaling in LNCaP, 22Rv1, and C4-2B PCa cell types. We demonstrate that NDRG1 effectively promotes interaction of AR with the chaperone HSP90, which in turn stabilizes the AR while decreasing its androgen-mediated activation. The expression of NDRG1 suppressed: (1) AR activation, as measured by p-ARSer213 and p-ARSer81; (2) expression of a major AR transcriptional target, prostate-specific antigen (PSA); and (3) AR transcriptional activity, probably via inhibiting the c-Jun-AR interaction by reducing c-Jun phosphorylation (p-c-JunSer63). NDRG1 was also demonstrated to inhibit multiple key molecules involved in androgen-dependent and -independent signaling (namely EGFR, HER2, HER3, PI3K, STAT3, and NF-κB), which promote the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer. We also identified the cysteine-rich secretory protein/antigen 5/pathogenesis related-1 (CAP) domain of NDRG1 as vital for inhibition of AR activity. Examining NDRG1 and p-NDRG1 in PCa patient specimens revealed a significant negative correlation between NDRG1 and PSA levels in prostatectomy patients that went on to develop metastasis. These results highlight a vital role for NDRG1 in androgen signaling and its potential as a key therapeutic target and biomarker in PCa.""","""['Syer C Lim', 'Bekesho Geleta', 'Sanaz Maleki', 'Des R Richardson', 'Žaklina Kovačević']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['The role of N-cadherin/c-Jun/NDRG1 axis in the progression of prostate cancer.', 'Upregulation of prostate-derived Ets factor by luteolin causes inhibition of cell proliferation and cell invasion in prostate carcinoma cells.', 'The tumor suppressor ING1b is a novel corepressor for the androgen receptor and induces cellular senescence in prostate cancer cells.', 'The role of the NDRG1 in the pathogenesis and treatment of breast cancer.', 'Unravelling the Role of Kinases That Underpin Androgen Signalling in Prostate Cancer.', 'A review on the role of NDRG1 in different cancers.', 'Advances in NK cell therapy for brain tumors.', 'Cell-Type-Specific Signalling Networks Impacted by Prostate Epithelial-Stromal Intercellular Communication.', 'CDCA3 is a prognostic biomarker for cutaneous melanoma and is connected with immune infiltration.', 'NDRG1 in Cancer: A Suppressor, Promoter, or Both?']"""

Objective:   We hypothesize that aRT is safe and effective in gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen targeted positron emission tomography (PSMA-PET)-staged oligometastatic PCa patients.  Design, setting, and participants:   A nonrandomized, prospective, investigator-initiated phase 2 trial recruited patients with oligometastatic PCa (five or fewer lymph node or osseous metastases) after local curative therapy, without significant comorbidity and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), at two German centers from 2014 to 2018.  Intervention:   All PSMA-PET-positive metastases were treated with aRT. No systemic therapy was initiated.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary endpoint was treatment-related toxicity (grade ≥2) 24 mo after aRT. A one-sided single-sample test of proportions was planned to test whether the endpoint occurs in <15% of the patients. Key secondary endpoints were time to progression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and time to ADT, which were associated with potential prognostic factors by Cox regression.  Results and limitations:   Of 72 patients, 63 received aRT (13% dropout rate). The median follow-up was 37.2 mo. No treatment-related grade ≥2 toxicity was observed 2 yr after treatment. The median time to PSA progression and time to ADT were 13.2 and 20.6 mo, respectively. Of the patients, 21.4% were free of PSA progression after 3 yr.  Conclusions:   It was observed that aRT is safe, and midterm PSA progression and ADT-free time were achieved in one of five patients. Randomized clinical trials are indicated to further evaluate the option of delaying ADT in selected patients.  Patient summary:   In this clinical trial, 63 patients with up to five metastases of prostate cancer without androgen deprivation therapy were included. We showed that local ablative radiotherapy is safe and that one in five patients had no recurrent prostate-specific antigen value after 3 yr.

Accurate and fast delineation of the prostate and DILs is thus required during treatment planning. In this paper, we develop a learning-based method using positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) images to automatically segment the prostate and its DILs. To enable end-to-end segmentation, a deep learning-based method, called cascaded regional-Net, is utilized. The first network, referred to as dual attention network, is used to segment the prostate via extracting comprehensive features from both PET and CT images. A second network, referred to as mask scoring regional convolutional neural network (MSR-CNN), is used to segment the DILs from the PET and CT within the prostate region. Scoring strategy is used to diminish the misclassification of the DILs. For DIL segmentation, the proposed cascaded regional-Net uses two steps to remove normal tissue regions, with the first step cropping images based on prostate segmentation and the second step using MSR-CNN to further locate the DILs. The binary masks of DILs and prostates of testing patients are generated on the PET/CT images by the trained model. For evaluation, we retrospectively investigated 49 prostate cancer patients with PET/CT images acquired. The prostate and DILs of each patient were contoured by radiation oncologists and set as the ground truths and targets. We used five-fold cross-validation and a hold-out test to train and evaluate our method. The mean surface distance and DSC values were 0.666 ± 0.696 mm and 0.932 ± 0.059 for the prostate and 0.814 ± 1.002 mm and 0.801 ± 0.178 for the DILs among all 49 patients.

This changed from the USPSTF's May 2012 recommendation against screening for all ages. The effects of the 2012 and 2018 updates on pathologic outcomes after prostatectomy are unclear.  Methods:   This study included 647 patients with PCa who underwent prostatectomy at our institution from 2005 to 2018. Patient groups were those diagnosed before the 2012 update (n = 179), between 2012 and 2018 updates (n = 417), and after the 2018 update (n = 51). We analyzed changes in the age of diagnosis, pathologic Gleason grade group (pGS), pathologic stage, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and favorable/unfavorable pathology. Multivariable logistic regression adjusting for pre-biopsy covariables (age, prostate-specific antigen [PSA], African American race, family history) assessed impacts of 2012 and 2018 updates on pGS and pathologic stage. A p < 0.05 was statistically significant.  Results:   Median age increased from 60 to 63 (p = 0.001) between 2012 and 2018 updates and to 64 after the 2018 update. A significant decrease in pGS1, pGS2, pT2, and favorable pathology (p < 0.001), and a significant increase in pGS3, pGS4, pGS5, pT3a, and unfavorable pathology (p < 0.001) was detected between 2012 and 2018 updates. There was no significant change in pT3b or LVI between 2012 and 2018 updates. On multivariable regression, diagnosis between 2012 and 2018 updates was significantly associated with pGS4 or pGS5 and pT3a (p < 0.001). Diagnosis after the 2018 update was significantly associated with pT3a (p = 0.005). Odds of pGS4 or pGS5 were 3.2× higher (p < 0.001) if diagnosed between 2012 and 2018 updates, and 2.3× higher (p = 0.051) if after the 2018 update.

Conclusions:   The 2012 USPSTF guidelines negatively impacted pathologic outcomes after prostatectomy. Patients diagnosed between 2012 and 2018 updates had increased frequency of higher-risk PCa and lower frequency of favorable disease.

Upgrading, downgrading, concordance, and any discordance between posttreatment biopsy ISUP and ISUP at SRP were tested. Logistic regression models were used to predict ISUP upgrading and ISUP discordance. Models were adjusted for prostatic specific antigen before SRP, age at surgery, initial prostatic specific antigen (PSA), type of primary treatment, time from primary PCa diagnosis to SRP, number of positive cores at biopsy, and original Gleason score.  Results:   Overall, 184 patients with available biopsy and pathologic ISUP grading were identified.

Animal pharmacokinetic studies also show that deuterization of enzalutamide as HC-1119 could retain the basic properties of mother drug, increases the stability of compounds to metabolic enzymes and the drug exposure in vivo, prolong the half-life and reduce the production of metabolites, which may lead to a better efficacy and safety of HC-1119 compared with enzalutamide.  Methods:   To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of HC-1119 and the effects of food on pharmacokinetics in healthy adult Chinese men after single-dose administration of HC-1119. A total of 47 Chinese healthy adult male subjects received HC-1119 soft capsule at a single oral dose of 40, 80, or 160 mg followed on fasting or 160 mg after high-fat meal respectively. HC-1119 prototype and its metabolites M1 and M2 in plasma were collected individually in a total 23 time points. Pharmacokinetics were determined by sensitive LC/MS/MS for dose-proportionality study.  Results:   In subjects taking HC-1119 soft capsules on fasting, Cmax of HC-1119 prototype increased dose-dependently. Either Cmax and AUC0-∞ of M1 or Cmax of M2 showed statistically significant difference. Dose-proportionality evaluation showed linear pharmacokinetic characteristics in Cmax of HC-1119 prototype, Cmax and AUC0-∞ of M2 in dose range of 40-160 mg. Cmax of HC-1119 was significantly different between the two groups as 160 mg HC-1119 on fasting or after a high-fat diet respectively, while the other parameter were not. HC-1119 and its metabolites M1 and M2 showed a linear dynamic trend.  Conclusions:   HC-1119 is expected to have lower clinical dose than the similar drug enzalutamide. The absorption of HC-1119 and the main pharmacokinetic parameters of HC-1119 and its metabolites M1 and M2 were not affected by high-fat diet. The clinical application of HC-1119 soft capsule in the later stage can be recommended for both fasting and postprandial.

As such, there is a tremendous interest in new simple-to-operate vesicular microRNA analysis tools for widespread use in performing liquid biopsies. Herein, we present a two-step competitive hybridization assay that is rationally designed to translate low microRNA concentrations to large electrochemical signals as the measured signal is inversely proportional to the microRNA concentration. Using this assay, with a limit-of-detection of 122 aM, we successfully analyzed vesicular miRNA 200b from prostate cancer cell lines and human urine samples, demonstrating the expected lower expression levels of miRNA 200b in the EVs from prostate cancer cells and in the prostate cancer patient's urine samples compared to healthy patients and non-tumorigenic cell lines, validating the suitability of our approach for clinical analysis.""","""['Sudip Saha', 'Susann Allelein', 'Richa Pandey', 'Paula Medina-Perez', 'Enas Osman', 'Dirk Kuhlmeier', 'Leyla Soleymani']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['Extracellular vesicles and encapusulated miRNAs as emerging cancer biomarkers for novel liquid biopsy.', 'The glycoprotein CD147 defines miRNA-enriched extracellular vesicles that derive from cancer cells.', 'Detection of circulating miRNAs: comparative analysis of extracellular vesicle-incorporated miRNAs and cell-free miRNAs in whole plasma of prostate cancer patients.', 'Impact of Extracellular Vesicle Isolation Methods on Downstream Mirna Analysis in Semen: A Comparative Study.', 'Extracellular Vesicles: New Endogenous Shuttles for miRNAs in Cancer Diagnosis and Therapy?', 'miRNAs as Predictors of Barrier Integrity.', 'Recent Advances in Exosomal miRNA Biosensing for Liquid Biopsy.', 'Urinary microRNAs and Their Significance in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: A 5-Year Update.']"""

ED visits were characterised by demographic factors, socioeconomic factors, and hospital characteristics. Weighted frequencies were used to create national estimates for all data analysis.  Results:   A weighted total of 17 382 ED visits occurred for RC among patients with a prostate cancer history, of which 9655 (55.5%) were treated with an invasive procedure. Notable factors associated with undergoing an invasive procedure included having a prior prostatectomy (odds ratio [OR] 5.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.62-11.46), urinary retention (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.12-1.64), haematuria (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.01-1.42), and undergoing a blood transfusion (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.72-2.62). ED visits that were associated with invasive procedures had a higher median total charge ($34 707.53 vs $15 632.53) and an increased median length of stay (5 vs 3 days) compared to visits without an invasive procedure.

We propose a novel Bayesian functional spatial partitioning (BFSP) algorithm, which estimates closed curves that act as partitioning boundaries around anomalous regions of data with a distinct distribution or spatial process. Our method utilizes transitions between a fixed Cartesian and moving polar coordinate system to model the smooth boundary curves using functional estimation tools. Using adaptive Metropolis-Hastings, the BFSP algorithm simultaneously estimates the partitioning boundary and the parameters of the spatial distributions within each region.

Design, setting, patients:   A qualitative explorative research design was employed. Data were collected from June to November 2017. The study was set at a urological outpatient clinic at a university hospital in Norway. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten men who had been examined for prostate cancer. Interviews were analyzed using Systematic Text Condensation (STC).  Results:   The analysis revealed three themes. The theme 'Different needs and perceptions of information' illustrated that information should be personalized. Despite different information needs, insufficient information about prostate cancer may prevent some men from being involved in decisions. The theme, 'A discovery of not being alone', indicated that a sense of affinity occurs when men realize the commonality of prostate cancer. Some men benefited from other men's experiences and knowledge about prostate cancer. The last theme 'Worries about cancer and mortality' showed that the emotional strain was affected by men's knowledge of cancer and the received information. Men expressed conflicting feelings toward prostate cancer that could be difficult to express.  Conclusions:   The findings indicate that men in the diagnostic phase of prostate cancer are not a homogeneous group, but need personalized information. Some men may benefit from other men's experiences and support. Men's emotional strain can affect their communication about prostate cancer, which should be acknowledged. Procedures that identify patients' information needs early on should be an integrated part of the diagnostic phase of prostate cancer.KEY POINTSKnowledge about men's information needs and possible emotional strain in the diagnostic phase of prostate cancer are limited.Men with suspected prostate cancer have different preferences and information needs; however, insufficient information prevents men from participating in decisions.Men experience a sense of affinity with other men affected by prostate cancer, and some men benefit from exchanging experiences.Men consider prostate cancer as a less aggressive type of cancer but may experience emotional strain.""","""['Maja Elisabeth Juul Søndergaard', 'Kirsten Lode', 'Svein Reidar Kjosavik', 'Sissel Eikeland Husebø']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Scand J Prim Health Care""","""[""Men's perception of information and psychological distress in the diagnostic phase of prostate cancer: a comparative mixed methods study."", ""This is an older men's world: A qualitative study of men's experiences with prostate cancer."", 'The clinical communication and information challenges associated with the psychosexual aspects of prostate cancer treatment.', ""Prostate cancer and supportive care: a systematic review and qualitative synthesis of men's experiences and unmet needs."", 'Prostate Cancer Treatment and Work: A Scoping Review.', ""Men's perception of information and psychological distress in the diagnostic phase of prostate cancer: a comparative mixed methods study.""]"""

R software package was used to generate a waterfall plot to summarize the specific mutation information and calculate the TMB value of PCa. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression analysis was used to select the hub genes related to the TMB from the ImmPort network to build a risk score (RS) model to evaluate prognostic values and plot Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves to predict PCa patients survival. The results showed that PCa patients with a high TMB exhibited higher infiltration of CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells and better overall survival (OS) than those with a low TMB. The anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 5 (BIRC5), and opoid receptor kappa 1 (OPRK1) genes were three hub genes and their copy number variation (CNV) was relatively likely to affect the infiltration of immune cells. Moreover, PCa patients with low AMH or BIRC5 expression had a longer survival time and lower cancer recurrence, while elevated AMH or BIRC5 expression favored PCa progression. In contrast, PCa patients with low OPRK1 expression had poorer OS in the early stage of PCa and a higher recurrent rate than those with high expression. Taken together, these results suggest that the TMB may be a promising prognostic biomarker for PCa and that AMH, OPRK1, and BIRC5 are hub genes affecting the TMB; AMH, OPRK1, and BIRC5 could serve as potential immunotherapeutic targets for PCa treatment.""","""['Licheng Wang', 'Yicong Yao', 'Chengdang Xu', 'Xinan Wang', 'Denglong Wu', 'Zhe Hong']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['Exploration of gene expression profiles and immune microenvironment between high and low tumor mutation burden groups in prostate cancer.', 'Gene expression and immune infiltration in melanoma patients with different mutation burden.', 'The prognostic value of TMB and the relationship between TMB and immune infiltration in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: A gene expression-based study.', 'Prognostic analysis of tumor mutation burden and immune infiltration in hepatocellular carcinoma based on TCGA data.', 'Immune related biomarkers for cancer metastasis to the brain.', 'GENOMICS OF PROSTATE CANCER: CLINICAL UTILITY AND CHALLENGES.', 'Immune microenvironment infiltration landscape and immune-related subtypes in prostate cancer.', 'A circadian rhythm-related gene signature for predicting relapse risk and immunotherapeutic effect in prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Pan-cancer analysis of tumor mutation burden sensitive tumors reveals tumor-specific subtypes and hub genes related to immune infiltration.']"""

An integrated microelectrode was designed to realize the miniaturization of the homogeneous electrochemical assay. Taking advantage of G3, that can specifically bind with MB and decrease its diffusion current, a single-stranded functional DNA hairpin structure was designed as the bio-recognition probe. The probe consisted of G3, eight bases to block G3, and the complementary sequences of the target miRNA. Here we chose miRNA141-a potentially diagnostic biomarker of prostate cancer as the model target. The presence of miRNA141 could hybridize with the probe DNA to form a double-stranded structure with a 5'-phosphorylated terminus. Then λ-Exo was adopted to digest mononucleotides from the 5'-end, leading to the release of G3 part and miRNA141. The released miRNA could hybridize with another probe to trigger the cycling process, while the released G3 could therefore interact with MB to cause a detectable decrease of diffusion current. The proposed strategy showed a low detection limit of 16 fM and an excellent specificity to discriminate single-base mismatches. Furthermore, this sensor was applied to detect miRNA141 from diluted human serum samples, indicating that it has great potential in the application of nucleic acid detection in real samples.""","""['Yao Meng', 'Fangming Chen', 'Mingrui Jiang', 'Qin Guo', 'Yaqiong Wang', 'Jian Wang', 'De-Wen Zhang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Front Chem""","""['Ultrasensitive detection of microRNA based on a homogeneous label-free electrochemical platform using G-triplex/methylene blue as a signal generator.', 'A novel miniaturized homogeneous label-free electrochemical biosensing platform combining integrated microelectrode and functional nucleic acids.', 'Homogeneous electrochemical aptasensor for mucin 1 detection based on exonuclease I-assisted target recycling amplification strategy.', 'Exonuclease-Catalyzed Target Recycling Amplification and Immobilization-free Electrochemical Aptasensor.', 'Ultrasensitive Homogeneous Electrochemical Detection of Transcription Factor by Coupled Isothermal Cleavage Reaction and Cycling Amplification Based on Exonuclease III.']"""

However, it remains unclear whether these redox-related genes (RRGs) have potential roles in the tumor microenvironment, immunotherapy, and drug sensitivity. Here, we performed a systematic and comprehensive analysis of 489 prostate cancer (PC) samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and 214 PC samples from 8 datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus database to determine redox modification patterns and the redox scoring system for PC. We identified two modification patterns (Redox_A and Redox_B) in PC using unsupervised consensus clustering based on 1410 differential expression RRGs. We then compared the prognostic value, tumor microenvironment characteristics, immune cell infiltration, and molecular characteristics of the two patterns. The Redox_A pattern was significantly enriched in the carcinogenic activation signaling pathways and had a poor prognosis, while the Redox_B pattern was mainly enriched in a variety of metabolic and redox pathways and had a good prognosis. Next, redox-related characteristic genes were extracted from these two patterns, and a scoring system (Redox_score) was constructed to evaluate PC patients. Further analysis indicated that lower Redox_score patients had a better prognosis, while higher Redox_score patients had a higher tumor mutation burden, driver gene mutation rate, and immune checkpoint inhibitor gene expression. We also found that higher Redox_score patients were more responsive to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.

CSN5, a putative androgen receptor (AR) partner that is located on chromosome 8q, is the key subunit of the COP9 signalosome, which deactivates ubiquitin ligases. Deregulation of CSN5 could affect diverse cellular functions that contribute to tumor development, but there has been no comprehensive study of its function in prostate cancer. The clinical significance of CSN5 amplification/overexpression was evaluated in 16 prostate cancer clinical cohorts. Its oncogenic activity was assessed by genetic and pharmacologic perturbations of CSN5 activity in prostate cancer cell lines. The molecular mechanisms of CSN5 function were assessed, as was the efficacy of the CSN5 inhibitor CSN5i-3 in vitro and in vivo. Finally, the transcription cofactor activity of CSN5 in prostate cancer cells was determined. The prognostic significance of CSN5 amplification and overexpression in prostate cancer was independent of MYC amplification. Inhibition of CSN5 inhibited its oncogenic function by targeting AR signaling, DNA repair, multiple oncogenic pathways, and spliceosome regulation. Furthermore, inhibition of CSN5 repressed metabolic pathways, including oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis in AR-negative prostate cancer cells. Targeting CSN5 with CSN5i-3 showed potent antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, CSN5i-3 synergizes with PARP inhibitors to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth. CSN5 functions as a transcription cofactor to cooperate with multiple transcription factors in prostate cancer.

It uses the recorded doses, i.e. dosimeter readings, evaluated inHp(10) for estimation of radiation risk; however, the International Commission on Radiological Protection does not recommend the use of effective doses for epidemiological evaluation and instead recommends the use of organ-absorbed doses for assessing cancer risk. Recently, the J-EPISODE has developed a conversion factor that can convert dosimeter readings to organ-absorbed doses following, in principle, the approach adopted by the International Agency for Research on Cancer 15-Country Collaborative Study. The approach was modified based on recent dosimeter usage practices and the Japanese physique. The aim of this study was to reanalyse the excess relative risk (ERR) of cancer mortality for the J-EPISODE using the previous analysis method but substituting the organ-absorbed dose for the recorded dose to confirm the adaptability and relevance of organ-absorbed doses for the J-EPISODE. The organ-absorbed doses from 1957 to 2010 were reconstructed for the whole cohort. The cancer mortality risk was reanalysed with Poisson regression methods, first by comparing the ERR/Gy for all cancers excluding leukaemia with the risk after excluding lung cancer for the whole cohort of 204 103 participants. In the whole cohort, all cancers excluding leukaemia, lung cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma had statistically significant positive ERR/Gy estimates; leukaemia excluding chronic lymphocytic leukaemia had negative but not statistically significant estimates. Gallbladder cancer and pancreatic cancer showed statistically significant negative. Then, a subcohort of 71 733 respondents was selected based on lifestyle surveys with data on qualitative smoking status as well as quantitative smoking information on pack-years. Pack-years for current smokers and former smokers and years since the cessation of smoking for former smokers were used for the smoking-adjusted model. The most important feature of the J-EPISODE revealed to date was a decreasing tendency of the ERR/Sv by the smoking adjustment. For almost all causes of death such as lung cancer and stomach cancer, the estimated ERR/Gy decreased by the smoking adjustment, although those for the colon, prostate and kidney and other urinary organs were almost the same after the adjustment. This tendency remained unchanged even when using the organ-absorbed dose, indicating the appropriateness of using organ-absorbed doses for further risk analysis. At the same time, it indicated that confounding by smoking seriously biased the radiation risk estimates in the J-EPISODE and thus should be accounted even if organ dose is used.""","""['Hiroshige Furuta', ""Shin'ichi Kudo"", 'Noboru Ishizawa', 'Shin Saigusa']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Radiol Prot""","""['Organ Dose Reconstruction Applicable for a Japanese Nuclear Worker Cohort: J-EPISODE.', 'The third analysis of cancer mortality among Japanese nuclear workers, 1991-2002: estimation of excess relative risk per radiation dose.', 'Occupational radiation exposure and mortality: second analysis of the National Registry for Radiation Workers.', 'Cancer and non-cancer effects in Japanese atomic bomb survivors.', 'Review of Cohort Studies Among Radiologists, Radiological Technologists, and Nuclear Workers.', 'Updated Mortality Analysis of SELTINE, the French Cohort of Nuclear Workers, 1968-2014.']"""

Recently, the importance of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in pre-metastatic niche formation has been reported. However, whether and how tumor-derived EVs interact with bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) to release EV-delivered microRNAs to promote osteolysis and induce pre-metastatic niche formation for PCa bone metastasis remain unclear. Our in vitro and in vivo functional and mechanistic assays revealed that EV-mediated release of miR-378a-3p from tumor cells was upregulated in bone-metastatic PCa, maintaining low intracellular miR-378a-3p concentration to promote proliferation and MAOA-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Moreover, miR-378a-3p enrichment in tumor-derived EVs was induced by hnRNPA2B1 (a transfer chaperone) overexpression. After tumor-derived EVs were taken in by BMMs, enriched miR-378a-3p promoted osteolytic progression by inhibiting Dyrk1a to improve Nfatc1 (an osteolysis-related transcription factor) nuclear translocation, to activate the expression of downstream target gene Angptl2. As a feedback, increased Angptl2 secretion into the tumor environment promoted PCa progression. In conclusion, tumor-derived miR-378a-3p-containing EVs play a significant role in PCa bone metastasis by activating the Dyrk1a/Nfatc1/Angptl2 axis in BMMs to induce osteolytic progression, making miR-378a-3p a potential predictor of metastatic PCa. Reducing the release of miR-378a-3p-containing EVs or inhibiting the recruitment of miR-378a-3p into EVs can be a therapeutic strategy against PCa metastasis.""","""['Jialin Wang', 'Xinxing Du', 'Xiao Wang', 'Huixiang Xiao', 'Nan Jing', 'Wei Xue', 'Baijun Dong', 'Wei-Qiang Gao', 'Yu-Xiang Fang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""['Small extracellular vesicles deliver osteolytic effectors and mediate cancer-induced osteolysis in bone metastatic niche.', 'Hypoxic bone marrow mesenchymal cell-extracellular vesicles containing miR-328-3p promote lung cancer progression via the NF2-mediated Hippo axis.', 'Mesenchymal stem cells-derived extracellular vesicles containing miR-378a-3p inhibit the occurrence of inflammatory bowel disease by targeting GATA2.', 'Communication of prostate cancer cells with bone cells via extracellular vesicle RNA; a potential mechanism of metastasis.', 'Extracellular Vesicles and Bone-Associated Cancer.', 'Biological function and research progress of N6-methyladenosine binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2B1 in human cancers.', 'Development of a circHIPK3-based ceRNA network and identification of mRNA signature in breast cancer patients harboring BRCA mutation.', 'Non-Classical Intercellular Communications: Basic Mechanisms and Roles in Biology and Medicine.', 'Non-Coding RNAs Derived from Extracellular Vesicles Promote Pre-Metastatic Niche Formation and Tumor Distant Metastasis.', 'Current Status of Research on Small Extracellular Vesicles for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Urological Tumors.']"""

However, RALP does not decrease postoperative pain significantly despite its minimal invasiveness. The pain associated with robot-assisted surgery is most severe during the immediate postoperative period. We aimed to demonstrate that preoperative rectus sheath block (RSB) can reduce acute pain after RALP.  Methods:   A prospective non-randomized study with two parallel groups was performed from June 2020 to August 2020. A total of 100 patients undergoing RALP were divided into two groups: the RSB group (n = 50) and the non-RSB group (n = 50). Ultrasound-guided RSB was performed preoperatively only in the RSB group. The primary outcome of the study was the visual analog scale (VAS) pain score during coughing (VAS-C) 1 h after surgery. In addition, the VAS pain score at rest (VAS-R) and the VAS-C were assessed up to 24 h after surgery. The doses of postoperative opioids consumed were also recorded.  Results:   The RSB group had a significantly lower VAS-C 1 h after RALP (58 [47-73] vs. 74 [63-83] mm, p = 0.001). In addition, the RSB group had significantly lower VAS-R and VAS-C scores, and postoperative opioid requirement, up to 6 h after surgery compared to the non-RSB group. Moreover, the VAS-R was significantly lower in the RSB group than in the non-RSB group 24 h after surgery.  Conclusion:   Preoperative RSB significantly improved analgesia during the early period after RALP.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of combining prostate health index (PHI) and mpMRI to estimate the histological tumor diameter and determine the safety margin during treatment of prostate cancer.  Methods:   We retrospectively enrolled 72 prostate cancer patients who underwent radical prostatectomy and had received PHI tests and mpMRI before surgery. We compared the discrepancy between histological and radiological tumor diameter stratified by Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score, and then assessed the influence of PHI on the discrepancy between low PI-RADS (2 or 3) and high PI-RADS (4 or 5) groups.  Results:   The mean radiological and histological tumor diameters were 1.60 cm and 2.13 cm, respectively. The median discrepancy between radiological and histological tumor diameter of PI-RADS 4 or 5 lesions was significantly greater than that of PI-RADS 2 or 3 lesions (0.50 cm, IQR (0.00-0.90) vs. 0.00 cm, IQR (-0.10-0.20), p = 0.02). In the low PI-RADS group, the upper limit of the discrepancy was 0.2 cm; so the safety margin could be set at 0.1 cm. In the high PI-RADS group, the upper limits of the discrepancy were 1.2, 1.6, and 2.2 cm in men with PHI < 30, 30-60, and > 60; so the safety margin could be set at 0.6, 0.8, and 1.1 cm, respectively.

Based on bioinformatics analysis findings of GEPIA and starBase databases, p53 was demonstrated to be involved in the development of PCa by transcriptionally activating microRNA-519d-3p (miR-519d-3p) expression to suppress the expression of E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) and CD147. In order to verify this finding, clinically-obtained PCa tumor tissues were enrolled and commercially-purchased PCa cell lines were used to detect the cell viability, cycle, and apoptosis, as well as invasion and migration by CCK-8, flow cytometry, and Transwell assays respectively. The results of clinical tissue experiments and in vitro cell experiments showed that miR-519d-3p and p53 were poorly-expressed in PCa tissues and cell lines, while E2F1 was highly-expressed. Overexpression of miR-519d-3p led to inhibited PCa cell proliferation, invasion and migration, and p53 overexpression was found to promote miR-519d-3p expression to suppress the malignant characteristics of PCa cells, while the additional E2F1 overexpression restored the malignant traits. Moreover, ChIP analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed the interactions among p53, miR-519d-3p, and E2F1. Mechanistically, it was found that p53 transcriptionally activated miR-519d-3p to suppress E2F1 expression. Finally, the in vitro results were further validated by in vivo experiments, which showed that miR-519d-3p prevents tumorigenesis and lymph node metastasis of PCa in nude mice via negatively regulation of E2F1 and CD147. Taken together, the findings uncover that the transcription factor p53 could upregulate miR-519d-3p expression to directly suppress the expression of E2F1, thus inhibiting PCa growth and metastasis. It highlights a novel therapeutic strategy against PCa based on the p53/miR-519d-3p/E2F1 regulatory pathway.""","""['Dong Zhang', 'Xiao-Jie Yang', 'Qi-Dong Luo', 'Li Xue', 'Tie Chong']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Gene Ther""","""['E2F-1 targets miR-519d to regulate the expression of the ras homolog gene family member C.', 'circ_0007385 served as competing endogenous RNA for miR-519d-3p to suppress malignant behaviors and cisplatin resistance of non-small cell lung cancer cells.', 'Long Noncoding RNA Regulator of Reprogramming Regulates Cell Growth, Metastasis, and Cisplatin Resistance in Gastric Cancer via miR-519d-3p/HMGA2 Axis.', 'MiR-1258 promotes the apoptosis of cervical cancer cells by regulating the E2F1/P53 signaling pathway.', 'Overexpression of miR-519d-3p inhibits the proliferation of DU-145 prostate cancer cells by reducing TRAF4.', 'Current perspectives on Vaxinia virus: an immuno-oncolytic vector in cancer therapy.']"""

Little is known about this or other variants in HOXB13 which may play a role in PCa susceptibility in African-American (AA) men.  Methods:   We sequenced HOXB13 in an AA population of 1048 men undergoing surgical treatment for PCa at Johns Hopkins Hospital.  Results:   Seven non-synonymous germline variants were observed in the patient population. While six of these variants were seen only once, X285K was found in eight patients. In a case-case analysis, we find that carriers of this latter variant are at increased risk of clinically significant PCa (1.2% carrier rate in Gleason Score ≥7 PCa vs. 0% in Gleason Score <7 PCa, odds ratio, OR = inf; 95% Confidence Interval, 95%CI:1.05-inf, P = 0.028), as well as PCa with early age at diagnosis (2.4% carrier rate in patients <50 year vs. 0.5% carrier rate in patients ≥50 year, OR = 5.25, 95% CI:1.00-28.52, P = 0.03).

However, its widespread implementation has been hampered by the supposed necessity of epidural or general anesthesia.  Objective:   To demonstrate the technique, feasibility, and results of transperineal MFGB under local anesthesia, in an ambulatory setting without the administration of prophylactic antibiotics.  Design, setting, and participants:   This single-center study enrolled consecutive biopsy-naïve men with a clinical suspicion of prostate cancer into a prospective database between November 2015 and November 2020. Men with Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2 scores 3-5 underwent transperineal MFGB.  Surgical procedure:   Transperineal MFGB was performed in an ambulatory setting under local anesthesia by a single operator.  Measurements:   Procedure-associated adverse events were recorded. Patient discomfort during both the local anesthesia and the biopsy procedure was determined using a visual analogic scale (0-10). Detection rates of grade group (GG) ≥2 prostate cancer and the proportion of men with GG 1 cancer were assessed.  Results and limitations:   A total of 1097 eligible men underwent transperineal MFGB. The complication rate was 0.73% (8/1097); complications comprised five (0.46%) urinary tract infections including one hospitalization and three (0.27%) urinary retentions. In 735 men, the median pain scores were 2 (interquartile range [IQR] 2-3) for the local anesthesia procedure and 1 (IQR 0-2) for the biopsy. Prostate cancer was detected in 84% (926/1097) of men; 66% (723/1097) had GG ≥2 and 19% (203/1097) GG 1.  Conclusions:   Transperineal MFGB can safely be performed as an outpatient procedure under local anesthesia in an ambulatory setting. The detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer is high, and biopsy is well tolerated. Although no antibiotic prophylaxis was used, the rate of infectious complications is practicably negligible.  Patient summary:   This article shows how tissue samples (biopsies) can accurately be obtained from suspicious regions seen on prostate magnetic resonance imaging via needles inserted in the perineum (skin between the scrotum and the anus) in men with suspected prostate cancer. This technique appears to be very well tolerated under local anesthesia and has a lower risk of infection without antibiotic prophylaxis than the more common biopsy route through the rectum, with antibiotics.""","""['Jos Immerzeel', 'Bas Israël', 'Joyce Bomers', 'Ivo G Schoots', 'Jean-Paul van Basten', 'Karl-Heinz Kurth', 'Theo de Reijke', 'Michiel Sedelaar', 'Frans Debruyne', 'Jelle Barentsz']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Transperineal prostate biopsy with cognitive magnetic resonance imaging/biplanar ultrasound fusion: description of technique and early results.', 'Pain in Men Undergoing Transperineal Free-Hand Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Fusion Targeted Biopsies under Local Anesthesia: Outcomes and Predictors from a Multicenter Study of 1,008 Patients.', 'Critical evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging targeted, transrectal ultrasound guided transperineal fusion biopsy for detection of prostate cancer.', 'Transrectal vs. transperineal fusion biopsy of the prostate : Time to switch to the perineal technique-comparison of methods and description of the transperineal procedure under local anesthesia.', 'Recent Advances and Current Role of Transperineal Prostate Biopsy.', 'Perineal nerve block versus periprostatic block for patients undergoing transperineal prostate biopsy (APROPOS): a prospective, multicentre, randomised controlled study.', 'Remote surgical education using synthetic models combined with an augmented reality headset.', 'Diagnostic Performance of a Magnetic Resonance Imaging-directed Targeted plus Regional Biopsy Approach in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'A comparative study of transperineal software-assisted magnetic resonance/ultrasound fusion biopsy and transrectal cognitive fusion biopsy of the prostate.']"""

Key findings:   PDGFRα was upregulated in androgen-independent PC-3 cells compared with normal prostate epithelial cells. PDGF-BB induced the phosphorylation of PDGFRα and downstream signaling molecules, including Akt, in a dose-dependent manner. Imatinib reduced the phosphorylation of the PDGFRα/Akt axis. Imatinib also suppressed the viability, proliferation, migration, and tumor growth of PC-3 cells. PDGFRα knockdown by siRNA decreased the viability and migration of PC-3 cells.

Multiple lines of evidence show that a significant proportion of PrCa risk can be explained by germline causal variants that dysregulate nearby target genes in prostate-relevant tissues, thus altering disease risk. The traditional approach to explore this hypothesis has been correlating GWAS variants with steady-state transcript levels, referred to as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). In this work, we assess the utility of chromosome conformation capture (3C) coupled with immunoprecipitation (HiChIP) to identify target genes for PrCa GWAS risk loci. We find that interactome data confirm previously reported PrCa target genes identified through GWAS/eQTL overlap (e.g., MLPH). Interestingly, HiChIP identifies links between PrCa GWAS variants and genes well-known to play a role in prostate cancer biology (e.g., AR) that are not detected by eQTL-based methods. HiChIP predicted enhancer elements at the AR and NKX3-1 prostate cancer risk loci, and both were experimentally confirmed to regulate expression of the corresponding genes through CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) perturbation in LNCaP cells.

The use of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for disease diagnosis, including cancer, is a promising research area that could support the diagnosis process. In this study, we investigated the urinary VOC profiles in BCa, PCa patients and non-cancerous controls by using gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS) and gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) to analyse patient samples. GC-IMS separated BCa from PCa (area under the curve: AUC: 0.97 (0.93-1.00)), BCa vs. non-cancerous (AUC: 0.95 (0.90-0.99)) and PCa vs. non-cancerous (AUC: 0.89 (0.83-0.94)) whereas GC-TOF-MS differentiated BCa from PCa (AUC: 0.84 (0.73-0.93)), BCa vs. non-cancerous (AUC: 0.81 (0.70-0.90)) and PCa vs. non-cancerous (AUC: 0.94 (0.90-0.97)).

Method:   To evaluate the changes in the gamma passing rate according to the MLC position error, 21 volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans were generated using pelvic lymph node metastatic prostate cancer patient's data which is sensitive to MLC position errors as they involve several long, narrow, irregular fields. The ASW for each VMAT plan was calculated using our own code developed using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). The gamma passing rate of the VMAT plan according to the MLC position error was evaluated using ArcCHECK (Sun Nuclear, Melbourne, FL, USA) while inducing symmetric MLC position errors in 0.25 mm intervals from -1 mm to +1 mm in the infinity medical linear accelerator (Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden). Finally, we examined the correlation between the change in the passing rate (γgradient) due to the MLC position error and the ASW in VMAT through linear regression analysis using the least squares method.  Results:   The ASW and γgradient were found to have a linear correlation according to the MLC position error, and the coefficient of determination was 0.88. For a 1 mm position error of MLC in VMAT, the gamma passing rate improved by approximately 11.9% as the ASW increased by 10 mm.

Furthermore, patient-derived organoids were used to assess the drug response. Treatment-naïve patient-derived PCa organoids were obtained from fresh radical prostatectomy specimens. These PCa organoids mimicked the heterogeneity of corresponding parental tumor tissue. Histopathological analysis demonstrated similar tissue architecture and cellular morphology, as well as consistent immunohistochemical marker expression. Also, the results confirmed the potential of organoids as an in vitro model to assess potential personalized treatment responses as there was a differential drug response between different patient samples.

We previously reported that high VASH1 expression is a predictor of progression in acinar adenocarcinoma of the prostate. In this study, we evaluated the characteristics of ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate by comparing the level of VASH1 expression between ductal and acinar adenocarcinoma specimens.  Design and setting:   A retrospective cohort study at two centres in Japan.  Participants:   Among the 1495 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy or transurethral resection for the past 15 years, a total of 14 patients diagnosed with ductal adenocarcinoma and 20 patients diagnosed with acinar adenocarcinoma with a Gleason score of 4+4 were included.  Interventions:   We immunohistochemically examined the CD34 expression as the microvessel density (MVD) and activated endothelial cells as the VASH1 density (vessels per mm2).  Primary and secondary outcome measures:   The primary outcome was the association of MVD and VASH1 density between ductal and acinar adenocarcinoma, and the secondary outcome was their oncological outcomes.  Results:   Nine patients (64.3%) with ductal adenocarcinoma were diagnosed at an advanced clinical stage, and five patients (35.7%) died from cancer during a median follow-up of 56.0 months. The VASH1 densities (mean±SD) in ductal and acinar adenocarcinoma were 45.1±18.5 vs 16.1±21.0 (p<0.001), respectively, while the MVD (mean±SD) in ductal and acinar adenocarcinoma were 65.3±21.9 vs 80.8±60.7 (p=0.666), respectively. The 5-year cancer-specific survival rates for high and low VASH1 expression were 70.0% and 100.0% (p=0.006), respectively. High VASH1 expression and a diagnosis of ductal adenocarcinoma were significant predictors of cancer-specific survival.  Conclusions:   Ductal adenocarcinoma was more aggressive and had higher VASH1 expression than acinar adenocarcinoma, although MVD was equivalent. These results indicate that VASH1 expression may serve as a novel biomarker for the aggressive nature of ductal adenocarcinoma.""","""['Hiroaki Kobayashi', 'Takeo Kosaka', 'Shuji Mikami', 'Tokuhiro Kimura', 'Hiroshi Hongo', 'Michio Kosugi', 'Yasufumi Sato', 'Mototsugu Oya']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BMJ Open""","""['Vasohibin-1 as a novel microenvironmental biomarker for patient risk reclassification in low-risk prostate cancer.', 'The prognostic significance of vasohibin-1 expression in patients with prostate cancer.', 'The prognostic significance of vasohibin-1 expression in patients with upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma.', 'Acinar with ductal and mucinous adenocarcinoma of prostate cancer complicated with lung metastasis: a case report and literature review.', 'Ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate: A systematic review and meta-analysis of incidence, presentation, prognosis, and management.', 'Construction of antibacterial nano-silver embedded bioactive hydrogel to repair infectious skin defects.']"""

The abnormal activity of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR1) in tumors has been reported in many studies. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are now commercially available for the treatment of a variety of cancers. Based on our previous studies, we assumed that a hybrid of aminopyrimidine derivatives as EGFR inhibitors and benzocheromen derivatives as cytotoxic agents can induce apoptosis in EGFR positive cancer cells. In the present study, the cytotoxic effect, ability of EGFR inhibition and apoptosis induction of some synthetic benzochromene pyrimidine derivatives were investigated on MDA-MB231, SKBR3 and PC3 cell lines.  Methods:   The EGFR inhibition activity was determined using cell-based EGFR ELISA kit. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay in 2D and 3D cultures. The apoptosis was confirmed through different methods such as fluorescent staining, annexin V- propidium iodide double staining, DNALadder assay, caspase-3 colorimetric assay, and nitric oxide assay.  Results:   The results of the MTT assay showed that derivatives with different substituents exhibited differential cytotoxicity in three cancer cell lines, although in MDA-MB231 the cytotoxicity effect of compounds is more obvious than the other cell lines. Production of nitric oxide, caspase-3 activity and DNA-fragmentation was significant in MDA-MB231 and PC3 cells. SKBR3 cells, despite having the lowest apoptosis among these three cell lines, showed a significant EGFR inhibition in the ELISA assay.

In this strategy, hierarchical flower-like MoS2 nanostructures as functional interface accelerated intermolecular accessibility and improved DNA hybridization efficiency. Moreover, the spherical SiO2 nanoprobe that conjugated with both electroactive tags and DNA probes, allowed effective electrochemical signal amplification. By deliberately designing different hybridization modes, we individually implemented the optimization of PSA and sarcosine sensing system. Based on this, simultaneous determination of PSA and sarcosine was achieved, with limit of detection (LOD) down to 2.5 fg/mL and 14.4 fg/mL, respectively, as well as excellent selectivity. More importantly, using this approach, we could directly differentiate cancer patients with healthy ones for clinical serum samples.

Most treatment options target the androgen receptor, to which many PCs eventually develop resistance. Thus, there is a dire need to identify and validate new molecular targets for treating PC. We found NUAK family kinase 2 (NUAK2) expression is elevated in PC and mCRPC versus normal tissue, and expression correlates with an increased risk of metastasis. Given this observation and because NUAK2, as a kinase, is actionable, we evaluated the potential of NUAK2 as a molecular target for PC. NUAK2 is a stress response kinase that also plays a role in activation of the YAP cotranscriptional oncogene. Combining pharmacological and genetic methods for modulating NUAK2, we found that targeting NUAK2 in vitro leads to reduction in proliferation, three-dimensional tumor spheroid growth, and matrigel invasion of PC cells. Differential gene expression analysis of PC cells treated NUAK2 small molecule inhibitor HTH-02-006 demonstrated that NUAK2 inhibition results in downregulation of E2F, EMT, and MYC hallmark gene sets after NUAK2 inhibition. In a syngeneic allograft model and in radical prostatectomy patient derived explants, NUAK2 inhibition slowed tumor growth and proliferation rates. Mechanistically, HTH-02-006 treatment led to inactivation of YAP and the downregulation of NUAK2 and MYC protein levels. Our results suggest that NUAK2 represents a novel actionable molecular target for PC that warrants further exploration.""","""['Weiwei Fu', 'Megan T Zhao', 'Lucy M Driver', 'Amelia U Schirmer', 'Qi Yin', 'Sungyong You', 'Stephen J Freedland', 'John DiGiovanni', 'David H Drewry', 'Everardo Macias']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mol Carcinog""","""['NUAK2 silencing inhibits the proliferation, migration and epithelial‑to‑mesenchymal transition of cervical cancer cells via upregulating CYFIP2.', 'miR-143 inhibits oncogenic traits by degrading NUAK2 in glioblastoma.', 'MYBL2 disrupts the Hippo-YAP pathway and confers castration resistance and metastatic potential in prostate cancer.', 'Genomic Testing in Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: A Pragmatic Guide for Clinicians.', 'Efficacy Against Human Prostate Cancer by Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-specific, Transforming Growth Factor-β Insensitive Genetically Targeted CD8+ T-cells Derived from Patients with Metastatic Castrate-resistant Disease.', 'Insights into recent findings and clinical application of YAP and TAZ in cancer.', ""Let's Go 3D!

This study aimed to compare the PCa detection rates and peri- and postoperative complications of PB among 3 residents and a consultant.  Patients and methods:   A total of 343 patients who underwent PB between August 2018 and July 2019 were involved in this study. Residents were systematically trained for 2 weeks by a consultant for performing systematic biopsy (SB) and targeted biopsy (TB). And then, 3 residents and the consultant performed PB independently every quarter due to routine rotation in daily practice. The peri- and postoperative data were collected from a prospectively maintained database (www.pc-follow.cn). The primary outcome and secondary outcome were to compare the PCa detection rates and complications between the residents and consultant, respectively.  Results:   There was no significant difference between the residents and consultant in terms of overall PCa detection rates of SB and TB or further stratified by prostate-specific antigen value and prostate imaging reporting and data system (PI-RADS) scores. We found the consultant had more TB cores (175 cores vs. 86-114 cores, p = 0.043) and shorter procedural time (mean 16 min vs. 19.7-20.1 min, p < 0.001) versus the residents. The complication rate for the consultant was 6.7% and 5%-8.2% for the residents, respectively (p = 0.875).  Conclusions:   The residents could get similar PCa detection and complication rates compared with that of the consultant after a 2-week training.

However, little is known about the preexisted anti-PD1/PDL1 autoantibodies (AAbs) distribution in multiple cancer types, nor is their potential biomarker role for anti-PD1 therapy.  Method:   Plasma anti-PD1/PDL1 AAb IgG and subclasses (IgG1-4) were detected by enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) in 190 cancer patients, covering 10 cancer types (lung, breast, esophageal, colorectal, liver, prostatic, cervical, ovarian, gastric cancers and lymphoma), the comprehensive correlation of AAbs with multiple clinical parameters was analyzed. We further tested these AAbs in 76 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples receiving anti-PD1 therapy, the association of AAbs level with survival was analyzed and validated in an independent cohort (n = 32).  Results:   Anti-PD1/PDL1 AAb IgG were globally detected in 10 types of cancer patients. IgG1 and IgG2 were the major subtypes for anti-PD1/PDL1 AAbs. Correlation analysis revealed a distinct landscape between various cancer types. The random forest model indicated that IgG4 subtype was mostly associated with cancer. In discovery cohort of 76 NSCLC patients, high anti-PD1 IgG4 was associated with a reduced overall survival (OS, p = 0.019), not progression-free survival (PFS, p = 0.088). The negative association of anti-PD1 IgG4 with OS was validated in 32 NSCLC patients (p = 0.032).  Conclusion:   This study reports for the first time the distribution of preexisted anti-PD1/PDL1 AAb IgG and subclasses across 10 cancer types.

Prostate-specific antigen levels are affected by use of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, but the association of statin use with PSA screening performance is unknown.  Objective:   To investigate whether statin use was associated with outcomes of a randomized PSA-based prostate cancer screening intervention.  Design, setting, and participants:   This post hoc subgroup analysis of a cohort from a population-based randomized clinical trial used data from the population-based Finnish Randomized Study of Prostate Cancer Screening, which randomized men to PSA screening or routine care from March 1, 1996, to December 31, 1999, with follow-up continuing until December 31, 2015. The population included all men aged 55 to 67 years at baseline and residing in the Tampere or Helsinki districts of Finland. Information on statin purchases from 1996 to 2009 was obtained from a national prescription registry. Eligible men were identified from the population registry of Finland. Prevalent prostate cancer cases at baseline were excluded. Data were analyzed from January 1, 2019 to March 31, 2021.  Interventions:   Three invitations for PSA screening at 4-year intervals from 1996 to 2007 vs routine care.  Main outcomes and measures:   Risk for prostate cancer overall, high-risk disease, and prostate cancer mortality in the screening group vs the control group as an intention-to-treat analysis. The analysis was stratified by statin use.  Results:   The study comprised 78 606 men (median age, 59 years [range, 55-67 years]) with statin purchase data available. Although PSA screening was associated with increased prostate cancer incidence among statin nonusers (screening vs control, 11.2 vs 8.6 per 1000 person-years); rate ratio [RR], 1.31; 95% CI, 1.24-1.38), no similar increase in incidence was observed among statin users (6.9 vs 5.9 per 1000 person-years; RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.95-1.10; P < .001 for interaction). Incidence of low-risk (Gleason score 6) and localized tumors was lower among statin users, whereas detection of tumors with a Gleason score of 8 to 10 was similar. Screening was associated with a lower incidence of metastatic tumors regardless of statin use.  Conclusion and relevance:   In this post hoc subgroup analysis of a cohort from a population-based randomized clinical trial, PSA screening among statin users was associated with a decreased incidence of advanced prostate cancer that was similar among statin nonusers, but with less increase in detection of low-grade localized tumors in statin users than in nonusers. These findings suggest that statin use does not materially compromise benefits of PSA-based screening.""","""['Arla Vettenranta', 'Teemu J Murtola', 'Jani Raitanen', 'Paavo Raittinen', 'Kirsi Talala', 'Kimmo Taari', 'Ulf-Håkan Stenman', 'Teuvo L J Tammela', 'Anssi Auvinen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""JAMA Oncol""","""['Prostate cancer and PSA among statin users in the Finnish prostate cancer screening trial.', 'Outcomes of Prostate-specific Antigen-based Prostate Cancer Screening Among Men Using Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs.', 'Statin use and risk of prostate cancer and high-grade prostate cancer: results from the REDUCE study.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Screening for prostate cancer.', 'A necroptosis gene signature predicts prostate cancer recurrence, and is linked to somatic mutation, therapeutic landscape, and immune infiltration.', 'Association of Statin Use with the Risk of Incident Prostate Cancer: A Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review.', 'The Integration of Metabolomics with Other Omics: Insights into Understanding Prostate Cancer.']"""

The frequency of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) following negative biparametric MRI (bpMRI) and multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) has not been well investigated in direct comparative studies. OBJECTIVE. The purposes of this study were to compare the frequency of csPCa after negative prebiopsy bpMRI and mpMRI and to evaluate factors predictive of csPCa in the two cohorts. METHODS. This retrospective study included 232 men (mean age, 64.5 years) with negative bpMRI from August 2017 to March 2020 and 193 men (mean age, 69.0 years) with negative mpMRI from January 2018 to December 2018. PI-RADS category 1 or 2 was defined as negative. The study institution offered bpMRI as a low-cost self-pay option for patients without insurer coverage of prebiospy mpMRI. Patient characteristics and subsequent biopsy results were recorded. CsPCa was defined as Gleason score of 3 + 4 or greater. Multivariable regression analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of csPCa. The AUC of PSA density (PSAD) for csPCA was computed, and the diagnostic performance of PSAD was assessed at a clinically established threshold of 0.15 ng/mL2. RESULTS. Systematic biopsy was performed after negative bpMRI for 41.4% (96/232) of patients and after negative mpMRI for 30.5% (59/193) (p = .02). Among those undergoing biopsy, csPCa was present in 15.6% (15/96) in the bpMRI cohort versus 13.6% (8/59) in the mpMRI cohort (p = .69). The NPV for csPCa was 84% (81/96) for bpMRI and 86% (51/59) for mpMRI. In multivariable analyses, independent predictors of csPCa included smaller prostate volume (OR, 0.27; p < .001) and greater PSAD (OR, 3.09; p < .001). In multivariable models, bpMRI (compared with mpMRI) was not independently predictive of csPCa (p > .05). PSAD had an AUC for csPCa of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.56-0.87) in the bpMRI cohort versus 0.68 (95% CI, 0.42-0.93) in the mpMRI cohort. For detecting csPCa, a PSAD threshold of 0.15 ng/mL2 had NPV of 90% and PPV of 28%, in the bpMRI cohort versus NPV of 92% and PPV of 44% in the mpMRI cohort. CONCLUSION. The frequencies of csPCa were not significantly different at systematic biopsy performed after negative bpMRI and mpMRI examinations. PSAD had similar diagnostic utility for csPCa in the two cohorts. CLINICAL IMPACT. Either bpMRI or mpMRI, in combination with PSAD measurement, can help avoid negative prostate biopsies.""","""['Jonathan M Gan', 'Elias G Kikano', 'Daniel A Smith', 'Sanjay Rao', 'Ruchika Podury', 'Margaret Wang', 'Jared C Durieux', 'Raj M Paspulati', 'Lee Ponsky', 'Nikhil H Ramaiya', 'Sree H Tirumani']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""AJR Am J Roentgenol""","""['Imaging.', 'MRI combined with PSA density in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer in patients with PSA serum levels of 4∼10ng/mL: Biparametric versus multiparametric MRI.', 'Analysis of risk factors for determining the need for prostate biopsy in patients with negative MRI.', 'Comparison of biparametric and multiparametric MRI in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'What Is the Negative Predictive Value of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Excluding Prostate Cancer at Biopsy?

Methods:   Time series study of hospitalization rate for malignant neoplasms at SUS. Data were extracted from the Hospital Information System of DataSUS. The trend was estimated using generalized linear regression, applying the Prais-Winsten estimation procedure.  Results:   From 2008 to 2018, the hospitalization rate for malignant neoplasms showed an increasing trend at SUS, with an annual variation of 10.7% (p < 0.001; CI = 9.4-11.7). An increasing trend of hospitalizations in all regions of Brazil was observed, except in the Northern region, which remained unchanged. The Northeastern region presented the highest annual variation (13.5%; p < 0.001), whereas the Southern and Southeastern regions had the highest hospitalization rates per 100,000 inhabitants, resulting in 506 and 325 hospitalizations, respectively. We observed a significant increasing trend in hospitalizations of children aged 0 to 9 years (annual variation = 10.9%; p < 0.001); young people, 10 and 19 years (annual variation = 6.9%; p < 0.001); and older adults; over 60 years (annual variation = 7.9%; p < 0.001). Among women, hospitalizations occurred mainly due to malignant neoplasm of the breast (annual variation = 13.2%; p < 0.001); and among men, malignant neoplasm of the prostate (annual variation = 4.7%; p < 0.001).  Conclusion:   Hospitalizations for malignant neoplasms showed an increasing trend, in line with the increased incidence of cancer, in particular, the most frequent neoplasms between men and women. Although the Northeastern region showed the highest variation in the period, the Southern and Southeastern regions had the highest hospitalization rates in the country.

Men prescribed TRT (Group B) had higher mean age, body mass index (BMI) and higher risks of hypertension, depression type 2 diabetes and ischaemic heart disease; conversely, men in Group B had lower mean pretreatment TT and were less likely to have prostate cancer. Four-hundred and thirty-six men (24.3%) with TT < 8 nmol/L and symptoms of low libido were not prescribed TRT.  Conclusions:   Our study highlights several factors which may influence the decisions made by clinicians when initiating TRT in primary care.

Yoga improves health-related quality of life (QoL) in patients with several types of cancer, but evidence of its efficacy in enhancing QoL is lacking in prostate cancer.  Methods:   In this randomized controlled study, 29 men newly diagnosed with localized prostate cancer were randomized to yoga for 6 weeks (n = 14) or standard-of-care (n = 15) before radical prostatectomy. The primary outcome was self-reported QoL, assessed by the Expanded Prostate Index Composite (EPIC), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) at baseline, preoperatively, and 6 weeks postoperatively. Secondary outcomes were changes in immune cell status and cytokine levels with yoga.  Results:   The greatest benefit of yoga on QoL was seen in EPIC-sexual (mean difference, 8.5 points), FACIT-F (6.3 points), FACT-Functional wellbeing (8.6 points), FACT-physical wellbeing (5.5 points), and FACT-Social wellbeing (14.6 points). The yoga group showed increased numbers of circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, more production of interferon-gamma by natural killer cells, and increased Fc receptor III expression in natural killer cells. The yoga group also showed decreased numbers of regulatory T-cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, indicating antitumor activity, and reduction in inflammatory cytokine levels (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [0.55 (0.05-1.05), p = 0.03], monocyte chemoattractant protein [0.22 (0.01-0.43), p = 0.04], and FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 ligand [0.91 (-0.01, 1.82), p = 0.053].  Conclusions:   Perioperative yoga exercise improved QoL, promoted an immune response, and attenuated inflammation in men with prostate cancer.

However, the regulatory mechanism that connects neuroendocrine differentiation and metabolic adaptation in response to therapeutic resistance of prostate cancer remain to be unravelled.  Methods:   By unbiased cross-correlation between RNA-sequencing, database signatures, and ChIP analysis, combining in vitro cell lines and in vivo animal models, we identified that PCK1 is a pivotal regulator in therapy-induced neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer through a LIF/ZBTB46-driven glucose metabolism pathway.  Results:   Upregulation of PCK1 supports cell proliferation and reciprocally increases ZBTB46 levels to promote the expression of neuroendocrine markers that are conducive to the development of neuroendocrine characteristic CRPC. PCK1 and neuroendocrine marker expressions are regulated by the ZBTB46 transcription factor upon activation of LIF signalling. Targeting PCK1 can reduce the neuroendocrine phenotype and decrease the growth of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.

Inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6 with palbociclib also leads to accumulation of cells in the G1-phase. Here, a combination of EPI-7170 with palbociclib attenuated the in vivo growth of human castration-resistant prostate cancer xenografts that are resistant to antiandrogens. Cell-cycle tracing experiments in cultured cells revealed that EPI-7170 targeted cells in the S-phase, possibly through inducing DNA damage or impairing the DNA damage response, whereas palbociclib targeted the G1-S transition to delay the cell cycle. Combination treatment prevented cells in G1 and G2-M from progressing in the cell cycle and caused a portion of cells in the S-phase to arrest, which contributed to a twofold increase in doubling time to >63 hours compared with 25 hours in control cells. Importantly, sequential combination treatments with palbociclib administered first then followed by EPI-7170, resulted in more cells accumulating in G1 and less cells in the S-phase than concomitant combination which was presumably because each inhibitor has a unique mechanism in modulating the cell cycle in cancer cells.

This approach achieves a higher thermal enhancement ratio than in sequential application of radiation and hyperthermia and has the potential to decrease the overall treatment time.  Methods:   The new applicator uses the principle of capacitively coupled electrodes. We performed a proof of concept experiment to demostrate the feasibility of the proposed applicator. Moreover, we used electromagnetic and thermal simulations to evaluate the power needs and temperature homogeneity in different tissues. Furthermore we investigated whether dynamic phase and amplitude adaptation can be used to improve longitudinal temperature control.  Results:   Simulations demonstrate that the electrodes achieve good temperature homogeneity in a homogenous phantom when following current applicator spacing guidelines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by dynamic phase and amplitude adaptation provides a great advancement for further adaptability of the heating pattern.

Many cancer patients suffer from metastases at an advanced stage, especially bone metastases, which are the third most frequent site of metastases and often occur in prostate, breast and lung carcinomas. Potential consequences are pain, pathological fractures and myelon compression with loss of function. Often there is a rapid reduction in the quality of life of the already burdened patients. Treatment is performed in an interdisciplinary setting with oncologists, radiation oncologists, palliative care and pain physicians as well as surgeons. Local radiotherapy is an established treatment option in order to achieve rapid, uncomplicated symptom control with few side effects and an improvement in the quality of life.

In the last few years many mathematical models have been proposed to describe the dynamics of prostate cancer under treatment. So far one of the major challenges has been the development of mathematical models that would represent in vivo conditions and therefore be suitable for clinical applications, while being mathematically treatable. In this paper, we take a step in this direction, by proposing a nonlinear distributed-delay dynamical system that explores neuroendocrine transdifferentiation in human prostate cancer in vivo. Sufficient conditions for the existence and the stability of a tumour-present equilibrium are given, and the occurrence of a Hopf bifurcation is proven for a uniform delay distribution. Numerical simulations are provided to explore differences in behaviour for uniform and exponential delay distributions. The results suggest that the choice of the delay distribution is key in defining the dynamics of the system and in determining the conditions for the onset of oscillations following a switch in the stability of the tumour-present equilibrium.""","""['Leo Turner', 'Andrew Burbanks', 'Marianna Cerasuolo']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Math Biosci Eng""","""['Stability and Hopf bifurcation analysis for a Lac operon model with nonlinear degradation rate and time delay.', 'Dynamics of a malaria infection model with time delay.', 'Hopf bifurcation, stability switches and chaos in a prey-predator system with three stage structure and two time delays.', 'Neuroendocrine-like prostate cancer cells: neuroendocrine transdifferentiation of prostate adenocarcinoma cells.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Transcription of these genes was further increased in cells exposed to exosomes shed from T2D patient–derived adipocytes or insulin-resistant adipocytes and required the epigenetic reader proteins BRD2 and BRD4 in recipient cells. The thrombospondin family protein TSP5, which is associated with cancer, was more abundant in exosomes from T2D or insulin-resistant adipocytes and partially contributed to EMT in recipient cells. Bioinformatic analysis of breast cancer patient tissue showed that greater coexpression of COMP (which encodes TSP5) and BRD2 or BRD3 correlated with poorer prognosis, specifically decreased distant metastasis–free survival.

These men were divided into 3 age-stratified groups (group 1 ≤ 45 years, group 2 46-50 years, and group 3 51-55 years old). Age-stratified groups were compared for clinical, oncological, and trifecta outcomes. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models were used to identify survival estimations and their predictors. Overall, 33% and 22% of men had non-organ confined (≥ pT3) and Gleason ≥ 4 + 3 prostate cancer at final pathology, respectively. Younger patients had a higher incidence of low-risk disease and better erectile function at presentation. Organ-confined and Gleason 3 + 3 cancer rates for men ≤ 45 and 51-55 years were 82 vs. 74% and 41 vs. 30%, respectively (p < 0.05).

This study is limited by its retrospective design. At RALP, one-third of patients ≤ 55 years have locally advanced or high-risk prostate cancer. Age ≤ 45 years is associated with higher incidence of favorable tumor characteristics, which gives the surgeon increased ability to perform bilateral full NS, resulting in better functional recovery.

Objective:   To assess utilization trends of G-CSFs for primary prophylaxis of febrile neutropenia (FN) among patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy with commercial or Medicare insurance.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cross-sectional study assessed G-CSF utilization trends overall and stratified by regimen febrile neutropenia risk level. Associations between patient characteristics and G-CSF use were evaluated. Patients with cancer, including breast, lung, colorectal, esophageal and gastric, pancreatic, prostate, ovarian, and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, initiating myelosuppressive chemotherapy courses were included from the 2014 to 2019 commercial insurance and 2014 to 2018 Medicare fee-for-service claims databases. Data were analyzed from March to June 2021.  Exposures:   Year of chemotherapy initiation.  Main outcomes and measures:   The main outcomes were use and trends of G-CSFs for primary prophylaxis, from completion to 3 days after in the first chemotherapy cycle.  Results:   In total, 86 731 chemotherapy courses (mean [SD] age, 57.7 [11.5] years; 57 838 [66.7%] women and 28 893 [33.3%] men) were identified from 82 410 patients in the commercial insurance database and 32 398 chemotherapy courses (mean [SD] age, 71.8 [8.3] years; 18 468 [57.0%] women and 13 930 [43.0%] men) were identified from 30 279 patients in the Medicare database. Among the commercially insured population, 39 639 patients (45.7%) received G-CSFs, and 12 562 patients (38.8%) received G-CSFs among Medicare insured patients. Overall G-CSF use increased significantly throughout the study period in both populations, from 45.1% (95% CI, 44.4%-45.7%) of patients in 2014 to 47.5% (95% CI, 46.5%-48.5%) of patients in 2019 (P = .001) in the commercially insured population and from 36.0% (95% CI, 34.2%-38.0%) of patients in 2014 to 39.1% (95% CI, 38.1%-40.1%) of patients in 2018 (P < .001) in the Medicare population. The greatest increases in G-CSF use were observed among patients with high FN risk, from 75.0% (95% CI, 74.1%-76.0%) of patients to 83.2% (95% CI, 82.0%-84.2%) of patients (P < .001) among the commercially insured population and 75.3% (95% CI, 71.8%-78.6%) of patients to 86.2% (95% CI, 84.7%-87.6%) of patients (P < .001) among the Medicare population.

Factors associated with increased odds of G-CSF use included older age (commercial insurance: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.50 [95% CI, 1.41-1.59]; Medicare: aOR, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.08-1.71]), receiving a regimen with high FN risk (commercial insurance: aOR, 16.01 [95% CI, 15.17-16.90]; Medicare: aOR, 17.17 [95% CI, 15.76-18.71]), and history of neutropenia (commercial insurance: 3.90 (3.67-4.15); Medicare: 3.82 (3.50-4.18).

To reach a dichotomous clinical decision, a threshold would be imposed to distinguish subjects with disease from nondiseased individuals. Among various performance metrics, specificity at a controlled sensitivity level (or vice versa) is often desirable because it directly targets the clinical utility of the intended clinical test. Meanwhile, covariates, such as age, race, as well as sample collection conditions, could impact the biomarker distribution and may also confound the association between biomarker and disease status. Therefore, covariate adjustment is important in such biomarker evaluation. Most existing covariate adjustment methods do not specifically target the desired sensitivity/specificity level, but rather do so for the entire biomarker distribution. As such, they might be more prone to model misspecification. In this paper, we suggest a parsimonious quantile regression model for the diseased population, only locally at the controlled sensitivity level, and assess specificity with covariate-specific control of the sensitivity. Variance estimates are obtained from a sample-based approach and bootstrap. Furthermore, our proposed local model extends readily to a global one for covariate adjustment for the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve over the sensitivity continuum. We demonstrate computational efficiency of this proposed method and restore the inherent monotonicity in the estimated covariate-adjusted ROC curve. The asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are established. Simulation studies show favorable performance of the proposal.

We have investigated the use of miRNA in urinary extracellular vesicles to stratify these patients.  Methods:   NGS was performed to profile the miRNAs from small urinary extracellular vesicles in a cohort of 70 patients with prostate cancer ISUP Grade 1, 2 or 3. The most promising candidates were then analysed by RT-qPCR in a new cohort of 60 patients.  Results:   NGS analysis identified nine miRNAs differentially expressed in at least one of the comparisons. The largest differences were found with miR-1290 (Grade 3 vs. 1), miR-320a-3p (Grade 3 vs. 2) and miR-155-5p (Grade 2 vs. 1). Combinations of 2-3 miRNAs were able to differentiate between two ISUP grades with an AUC 0.79-0.88. RT-qPCR analysis showed a similar trend for miR-186-5p and miR-30e-5p to separate Grade 3 from 2, and miR-320a-3p to separate Grade 2 from 1.  Conclusions:   Using NGS, we have identified several miRNAs that discriminate between prostate cancer patients with ISUP Grades 1, 2 and 3. Moreover, miR-186-5p, miR-320a-3p and miR-30e-5p showed a similar behaviour in an independent cohort using an alternative analytical method.

Prior studies have suggested an association between ADT use and acute kidney injury (AKI), however, these included heterogeneous populations undergoing a variety of treatments and relied on billing codes to ascertain the incidence of AKI.  Methods:   We analyzed a cohort of 27,868 veterans undergoing definitive RT + /- ADT for prostate cancer between 2001 and 2015 using the Veterans Affairs Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI). Exposure was defined as use of ADT within one year of diagnosis. The primary outcome was AKI, defined by an increase in serum creatinine to at least 1.5 times the baseline value. AKIs were classified as mild, moderate, or severe in accordance with international guidelines. A multivariate competing risks model was used to account for demographic and oncologic factors as well as medications and procedures known to influence the risk of AKI.  Results:   Most (n = 18,754) men received RT alone; 9,114 men received RT + ADT. The incidence of AKI at two years after diagnosis was 10.5% in the RT + ADT group and 7.9% in the RT group (Gray's test p < 0.01). Multivariate analysis confirmed ADT usage was associated with an increased risk for any AKI (SHR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.14-1.36, p < 0.01). ADT was also associated with an increased risk of mild AKI (SHR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.01-1.27, p = 0.04) and moderate AKI (SHR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.20-1.76, p < 0.01), though not severe AKI (SHR = 1.33, 95% CI = 0.93-1.91, p = 0.11).

However, their contribution to NEPC was not studied well. In this study, we explored whether sympathetic neurosignaling contributes to NED. We found that human prostate tumors from patients that later developed metastases and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), a stage preceding to NEPC, have high sympathetic innervations. Our work revealed that high concentrations of the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) induces NED-like changes in PC cells in vitro, evident by their characteristic cellular and molecular changes. The NE-mediated NED was effectively inhibited by the Adrβ2 blocker propranolol.

We reasoned that the combination of CART cells, with the consequent tumor debulking and release of Ags, together with an immunomodulatory agent, such as the stimulator of interferon gene ligand (STING-L) 2'3'-cyclic GMP-AMP (2'3'-cGAMP), may facilitate the activation of an endogenous response to secondary tumor Ags able to counteract this tumor escape mechanism.  Methods:   Mice bearing B16-derived tumors expressing prostate-specific membrane Ag or gp75 were treated systemically with cognate CART cells followed by intratumoral injections of 2'3'-cGAMP. We studied the target Ag inmunoediting by CART cells and the effect of the CART/STING-L combination on the control of STING-L-treated and STING-L-non-treated tumors and on the endogenous antitumor T-cell response. The role of Batf3-dependent dendritic cells (DCs), stimulator of interferon gene (STING) signaling and perforin (Perf)-mediated killing in the efficacy of the combination were analyzed.  Results:   Using an immune-competent solid tumor model, we showed that CART cells led to the emergence of tumor cells that lose the target Ag, recreating the cancer immunoediting effect of CART-cell therapy. In this setting, the CART/STING-L combination, but not the monotherapy with CART cells or STING-L, restrained tumor progression and enhanced overall survival, showing abscopal effects on distal STING-L-non-treated tumors. Interestingly, a secondary immune response against non-chimeric antigen receptor-targeted Ags (epitope spreading), as determined by major histocompatibility complex-I-tetramer staining, was fostered and its intensity correlated with the efficacy of the combination. This was consistent with the oligoclonal expansion of host T cells, as revealed by in-depth T-cell receptor repertoire analysis. Moreover, only in the combination group did the activation of endogenous T cells translate into a systemic antitumor response. Importantly, the epitope spreading and the antitumor effects of the combination were fully dependent on host STING signaling and Batf3-dependent DCs, and were partially dependent on Perf release by CART cells. Interestingly, the efficacy of the CART/STING-L treatment also depended on STING signaling in CART cells.  Conclusions:   Our data show that 2'3'-cGAMP is a suitable adjuvant to combine with CART-cell therapy, allowing the induction of an endogenous T-cell response that prevents the outgrowth of Ag-loss tumor variants.""","""['Enrique Conde', 'Enric Vercher', 'Marta Soria-Castellano', 'Jesús Suarez-Olmos', 'Uxua Mancheño', 'Edurne Elizalde', 'M Luis Rodriguez', 'Javier Glez-Vaz', 'Noelia Casares', 'Estefanía Rodríguez-García', 'Mirja Hommel', 'Gloria González-Aseguinolaza', 'Iratxe Uranga-Murillo', 'Julian Pardo', 'Gorka Alkorta', 'Ignacio Melero', 'Juan Lasarte', 'Sandra Hervas-Stubbs']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Immunother Cancer""","""['Potent STING activation stimulates immunogenic cell death to enhance antitumor immunity in neuroblastoma.', 'Adoptive cellular therapy with T cells expressing the dendritic cell growth factor Flt3L drives epitope spreading and antitumor immunity.', 'STING activation of tumor endothelial cells initiates spontaneous and therapeutic antitumor immunity.', 'Intrinsic strategies for the evasion of cGAS-STING signaling-mediated immune surveillance in human cancer: How therapy can overcome them.', 'The Potential Role of the Intestinal Micromilieu and Individual Microbes in the Immunobiology of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Therapy.', 'Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-Cell Therapy for Patients with Lung Cancer: Current Perspectives.', 'mRNAs encoding IL-12 and a decoy-resistant variant of IL-18 synergize to engineer T\xa0cells for efficacious intratumoral adoptive immunotherapy.', 'The abscopal effect in patients with cancer receiving immunotherapy.']"""

We sought to characterize patients with multiple (≥2) primary cancers (MPC) to assess associations and genetic mechanisms.  Methods:   Patients were prospectively consented (01/2013-02/2019) to tumor-normal sequencing via a custom targeted panel (MSK-IMPACT). A subset consented to return of results of ≥76 cancer predisposition genes. International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) 2004 rules for defining MPC were applied. Tumor pairs were created to assess relationships between cancers. Age-adjusted, sex-specific, standardized incidence ratios (SIR) for first to second cancer event combinations were calculated using SEER rates, adjusting for confounders and time of ascertainment. Associations were made with germline and somatic variants.  Results:   Of 24,241 patients, 4,340 had MPC (18%); 20% were synchronous. Most (80%) had two primaries; however, 4% had ≥4 cancers. SIR analysis found lymphoma-lung, lymphoma-uterine, breast-brain, and melanoma-lung pairs in women and prostate-mesothelioma, prostate-sarcoma, melanoma-stomach, and prostate-brain pairs in men in excess of expected after accounting for synchronous tumors, known inherited cancer syndromes, and environmental exposures. Of 1,580 (36%) patients who received germline results, 324 (21%) had 361 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (PV), 159 (44%) in high penetrance genes.

We sought to provide extended follow-up of this cohort to confirm the safety and efficacy of this approach in a real-world scenario.  Materials and methods:   Fifty patients affected by local relapse after previous definitive or postoperative radiotherapy were treated with SBRT. Treatment provided a total dose of 30 Gy in five fractions. Data about biochemical relapse-free survival (BRFS) and metastasis-free survival (MFS), together with adverse events, were analysed. Toxicity was reported according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) score v.4.03.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 48.2 months, the median BRFS was 43 months. A Gleason score >7 and concomitant androgen deprivation therapy were shown to be predictors of the worst BRFS (hazard ratio 2.42, 95% confidence interval 1.09-5.41, P = 0.02; hazard ratio 2.83, 95% confidence interval 1.17-6.8, P = 0.02, respectively).

Elevated expression of TMPRSS4 correlates with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, prostate cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and other cancers. Previously, we demonstrated that TMPRSS4 promotes invasion and proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Here, we investigated whether TMPRSS4 confers cancer stem-like properties to prostate cancer cells and characterized the underlying mechanisms.  Methods:   Acquisition of cancer stem-like properties by TMPRSS4 was examined by monitoring anchorage-independent growth, tumorsphere formation, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activation, and resistance to anoikis and drugs in vitro and in an early metastasis model in vivo. The underlying molecular mechanisms were evaluated, focusing on stemness-related factors regulated by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-inducing transcription factors. Clinical expression and significance of TMPRSS4 and stemness-associated factors were explored by analyzing datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).  Results:   TMPRSS4 promoted anchorage-independent growth, ALDH activation, tumorsphere formation, and therapeutic resistance of prostate cancer cells. In addition, TMPRSS4 promoted resistance to anoikis, thereby increasing survival of circulating tumor cells and promoting early metastasis. These features were accompanied by upregulation of stemness-related factors such as SOX2, BMI1, and CD133. SLUG and TWIST1, master EMT-inducing transcription factors, made essential contributions to TMPRSS4-mediated cancer stem cell (CSC) features through upregulation of SOX2. SLUG stabilized SOX2 via preventing proteasomal degradation through its interaction with SOX2, while TWIST1 upregulated transcription of SOX2 by interacting with the proximal E-box element in the SOX2 promoter. Clinical data showed that TMPRSS4 expression correlated with the levels of SOX2, PROM1, SNAI2, and TWIST1. Expression of SOX2 was positively correlated with that of TWIST1, but not with other EMT-inducing transcription factors, in various cancer cell lines.  Conclusions:   Together, these findings suggest that TMPRSS4 promotes CSC features in prostate cancer through upregulation of the SLUG- and TWIST1-induced stem cell factor SOX2 beyond EMT. Thus, TMPRSS4/SLUG-TWIST1/SOX2 axis may represent a novel mechanism involved in the control of tumor progression.""","""['Yunhee Lee#', 'Junghwa Yoon#', 'Dongjoon Ko#', 'Minyeong Yu', 'Soojin Lee', 'Semi Kim']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['TMPRSS4 induces invasion and proliferation of prostate cancer cells through induction of Slug and cyclin D1.', 'TMPRSS4 Upregulates TWIST1 Expression through STAT3 Activation to Induce Prostate Cancer Cell Migration.', 'VEGFA links self-renewal and metastasis by inducing Sox2 to repress miR-452, driving Slug.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stemness: the Twist1-Bmi1 connection.', 'Yin Yang 1 is associated with cancer stem cell transcription factors (SOX2, OCT4, BMI1) and clinical implication.', 'USP51 promotes non-small cell lung carcinoma cell stemness by deubiquitinating TWIST1.', 'A Novel Signature Based on Anoikis Associated with BCR-Free Survival for Prostate Cancer.', 'The Molecular Biology of Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: From the Past to the Future.', 'Anoikis in phenotypic reprogramming of the prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'TMPRSS4, a type II transmembrane serine protease, as a potential therapeutic target in cancer.']"""

This paper aimed to evaluate [18F]FMCH PET/CT radiomic analysis in patients with recurrent PCa after primary radical therapy. Specifically, we tested intra-patient lesions similarity in oligometastatic and plurimetastatic PCa, comparing the two most used definitions of oligometastatic disease.  Methods:   PCa patients eligible for [18F]FMCH PET/CT presenting biochemical failure after first-line curative treatments were invited to participate in this prospective observational trial. PET/CT images of 92 patients were visually and quantitatively analyzed. Each patient was classified as oligometastatic or plurimetastatic according to the total number of detected lesions (up to 3 and up to 5 or > 3 and > 5, respectively). Univariate and intra-patient lesions' similarity analysis were performed.  Results:   [18F]FMCH PET/CT identified 370 lesions, anatomically classified as regional lymph nodes and distant metastases. Thirty-eight and 54 patients were designed oligometastatic and plurimetastatic, respectively, using a 3-lesion threshold. The number of oligometastic scaled up to 60 patients (thus 32 plurimetastatic patients) with a 5-lesion threshold. Similarity analysis showed high lesions' heterogeneity. Grouping patients according to the number of metastases, patients with oligometastatic PCa defined with a 5-lesion threshold presented lesions heterogeneity comparable to plurimetastic patients. Lesions within patients having a limited tumor burden as defined by three lesions were characterized by less heterogeneity.  Conclusions:   We found a comparable heterogeneity between patients with up to five lesions and plurimetastic patients, while patients with up to three lesions were less heterogeneous than plurimetastatic patients, featuring different cells phenotypes in the two groups.

Methods:   Interaction and co-localization of MYB and AR were examined by co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence analyses, respectively. Protein levels were measured by immunoblot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

The functional significance of MYB in castration resistance was determined using an orthotopic mouse model.  Results:   MYB and AR interact and co-localize in the PCa cells. MYB-overexpressing PCa cells retain AR in the nucleus even when cultured under androgen-deprived conditions. AR transcriptional activity is also sustained in MYB-overexpressing cells in the absence of androgens. MYB binds and promotes AR occupancy to the KLK3 promoter. MYB-overexpressing PCa cells exhibit greater tumorigenicity when implanted orthotopically and quickly regain growth following castration leading to shorter mice survival, compared to those carrying low-MYB-expressing prostate tumours.

Materials and methods:   Individual patient data from six institutions for patients with intermediate-risk PCa treated with SBRT between 2006 and 2016 with a 4-year (42-54 months) PSA available were analysed. Cumulative incidences of biochemical failure and metastasis were calculated using Nelson-Aalen estimates and overall survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Biochemical failure-free survival was analysed according to 4yPSARR, with groups dichotomised based on PSA <0.4 ng/ml or ≥0.4 ng/ml and compared using the Log-rank test. A multivariable competing risk analysis was carried out to predict for biochemical failure and the development of metastases.  Results:   Six hundred and thirty-seven patients were included, including 424 (67%) with favourable and 213 (33%) with unfavourable intermediate-risk disease. The median follow-up was 6.2 years (interquartile range 4.9-7.9). The cumulative incidence of biochemical failure and metastasis was 7 and 0.6%, respectively; overall survival at 6 years was 97%.

We used multivariate logistic regression on 2005-2015 Tennessee Cancer Registry data of adults aged ≥18 diagnosed with prostate cancer. The outcome of treatment delay was more than 90 days without surgical or nonsurgical intervention from date of diagnosis. Social determinants in the population-based registry were race (White, Black, Other) and marital status (single, married, divorced/separated, widow/widower). Tennessee residence was classified as Appalachian versus non-Appalachian (urban/rural). Covariates include age at diagnosis (18-54, 54-69, ≥70), health insurance type (none, public, private), derived staging of cancer (localized, regional, distant), and treatment type (non-surgical/surgical). We found that Black and divorced/separated patients had 32% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.22-1.42) and 15% (95% CI: 1.01-1.31) increased odds to delay prostate cancer treatment.

To investigate the link between PFAS and prostate cancer, we evaluated the impact of metabolic alterations resulting from a high-fat diet combined with PFAS exposure on prostate tumor progression. We evaluated in vivo prostate cancer xenograft models exposed to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), a type of PFAS compound, and different diets to study the effects of PFAS on prostate cancer progression and metabolic activity.

Therefore, our research aimed to develop new cholesterol-based nanovesicles for delivering FLT to malignant cells in an endeavor to maximize its therapeutic efficacy and minimize undesired adverse effects. Draper-Lin small composite design was used to optimize the critical quality attributes of FLT-loaded niosomes and ensure the desired product quality. The influence of the selected four independent variables on mean particle size (Y1), zeta potential (Y2), drug entrapment efficiency (Y3), and the cumulative drug release after 24 h (Y4) was examined. The optimized nanovesicles were assessed for their in vitro cytotoxicity, ex-vivo absorption via freshly excised rabbit intestine as well as in vivo pharmacokinetics on male rats. TEM confirmed nanovescicles' spherical shape with bilayer structure. Values of dependent variables were 748.6 nm, -48.60 mV, 72.8% and 72.2% for Y1, Y2, Y3 and Y4, respectively. The optimized FLT-loaded niosomes exerted high cytotoxic efficacy against human prostate cancer cell line (PC-3) with an IC50 value of 0.64 ± 0.04 µg/mL whilst, it was 1.88 ± 0.16 µg/mL for free FLT. Moreover, the IC50 values on breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) were 0.27 ± 0.07 µg/mL and 4.07 ± 0.74 µg/mL for FLT-loaded niosomes and free FLT, respectively. The permeation of the optimized FLT-loaded niosomes through the rabbit intestine showed an enhancement ratio of about 1.5 times that of the free FLT suspension.

It is well known that epigenetic modifications may result in abnormal gene expression patterns, contributing to tumor initiation and progression. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the methylation pattern of the STEAP1 gene in PCa versus non-neoplastic cells. Bisulfite amplicon sequencing of the CpG island at the STEAP1 gene promoter showed a higher methylation level in non-neoplastic PNT1A prostate cells than in human PCa samples. Bioinformatic analysis of the GEO datasets also showed the STEAP1 gene promoter as being demethylated in human PCa, and a negative association with STEAP1 mRNA expression was observed. These results are supported by the treatment of non-neoplastic PNT1A cells with DNMT and HDAC inhibitors, which induced a significant increase in STEAP1 mRNA expression. In addition, the involvement of HDAC in the regulation of STEAP1 mRNA expression was corroborated by a negative association between STEAP1 mRNA expression and HDAC4,5,7 and 9 in human PCa.

This study examines the function and mechanisms of action of lncRNA AC016745.3 in the development of PCa. It shows that dihydrotestosterone (DHT) results in the AR-dependent suppression of AC016745.3 expression in the LNCaP androgen-sensitive human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line. In addition, overexpression of AC016745.3 inhibits the proliferation and migration of PCa cells, and suppresses the expression of AR target genes. This research also demonstrates that the protein NONO interacts with AR and functions as an AR co-activator, promoting AR transcriptional activity. Furthermore, using RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP)-PCR experiments, the study demonstrates that both NONO and AR can bind AC016745.3. Moreover, cell phenotypic experiments reveal that NONO can promote cellular proliferation and migration, and that AC016745.3 can partially antagonize the pro-oncogenic functions of NONO in PCa cells. In summary, the results indicate that AC016745.3 can bind NONO, suppressing its ability to promote AR-dependent transcriptional activity.

In contrast for GG2 (3 + 4) and GG3 (4 + 3) cancers PUR-4 levels increased in large volume cancers with statistical significance observed for GG2 (p = 0.005; Games-Howell).

Liquid biopsies, including cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs), are a valuable source for studying such biomarkers and are minimally invasive. In our study, we investigated the cfDNA of 34 progressive PCa patients, via targeted sequencing, for sequence variants and for the occurrence of CTCs, with a focus on androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7)-positive CTCs. The cfDNA content was associated with overall survival (OS; p = 0.014), disease-specific survival (DSS; p = 0.004), and time to treatment change (TTC; p = 0.001). Moreover, when considering all sequence variants grouped by their functional impact and allele frequency, a significant association with TTC (p = 0.017) was observed. When investigating only pathogenic or likely pathogenic gene variants, variants of the BRCA1 gene (p = 0.029) and the AR ligand-binding domain (p = 0.050) were associated with a shorter TTC.

However, how cells differentially control the shedding of these EV populations is poorly understood. Here, we show that miR-1227, which is enriched in prostate cancer EVs, compared to the cell of origin, but not in EVs derived from prostate benign epithelial cells, induces the shedding of large EVs (such as large oncosomes), while inhibiting the shedding of small EVs (such as exosomes). RNA sequencing from cells stably expressing miR-1227, a modified RISCTRAP assay that stabilizes and purifies mRNA-miR-1227 complexes for RNA sequencing, and in silico target prediction tools were used to identify miR-1227 targets that may mediate this alteration in EV shedding. The COPII vesicle protein SEC23A emerged and was validated by qPCR, WBlot, and luciferase assays as a direct target of miR-1227. The inhibition of SEC23A was sufficient to induce the shedding of large EVs. These results identify a novel mechanism of EV shedding, by which the inhibition of SEC23A by miR-1227 induces a shift in EV shedding, favoring the shedding of large EV over small EV.""","""['Andrew Chin', 'Javier Mariscal', 'Minhyung Kim', 'Giorgia Guerra', 'Blandine Victor', 'Chen Qian', 'Elisabetta Broseghini', 'Edwin Posadas', 'Michael R Freeman', 'Shivani Sharma', 'Paolo Gandellini', 'Nadia Zaffaroni', 'Sungyong You', 'Keith Syson Chan', 'Jlenia Guarnerio', 'Muller Fabbri', 'Dolores Di Vizio']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancers (Basel)""","""['SIV Infection Regulates Compartmentalization of Circulating Blood Plasma miRNAs within Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) and Extracellular Condensates (ECs) and Decreases EV-Associated miRNA-128.', 'Alterations in Abundance and Compartmentalization of miRNAs in Blood Plasma Extracellular Vesicles and Extracellular Condensates during HIV/SIV Infection and Its Modulation by Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) and Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC).', 'Epstein-Barr Virus LMP1 Promotes Syntenin-1- and Hrs-Induced Extracellular Vesicle Formation for Its Own Secretion To Increase Cell Proliferation and Migration.', 'Translating extracellular vesicle packaging into therapeutic applications.', 'Ciliary Extracellular Vesicles: Txt Msg Organelles.']"""

In prostate cancer (PCa), sPLND alone or combined with extended PLND (ePLND) reveals more LN metastases along with detecting sentinel LNs (SLNs) outside the conventional ePLND template. To overcome the disadvantages of radioisotope-guided sPLND in PCa treatment, magnetometer-guided sPLND applying superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles as a tracer was established. This retrospective study compared the nodal staging ability between magnetometer- and radioisotope-guided sPLNDs. We analyzed data of PCa patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and magnetometer- (848 patients, 2015-2021) or radioisotope-guided (2092 patients, 2006-2015) sPLND. To reduce heterogeneity among cohorts, we performed propensity score matching and compared data considering sentinel nomogram-based probabilities for LN involvement (LNI). Magnetometer- and radioisotope-guided sPLNDs had SLN detection rates of 98.12% and 98.09%, respectively; the former detected more SLNs per patient. The LNI rates matched nomogram-based predictions in both techniques equally well. Approximately 7% of LN metastases were detected outside the conventional ePLND template. Thus, we confirmed the reliability of magnetometer-guided sPLND in nodal staging, with results comparable with or better than radioisotope-guided sPLND.

Cardiac glycosides represent an attractive group of candidates for anticancer repurposing, but the cardiac glycoside deslanoside has not been tested for potential anticancer activity so far. We found that deslanoside effectively inhibited colony formation in vitro and tumor growth in nude mice of PCa cell lines 22Rv1, PC-3, and DU 145. Such an anticancer activity was mediated by both the cell cycle arrest at G2/M and the induction of apoptosis, as demonstrated by different functional assays and the expression status of regulatory proteins of cell cycle and apoptosis in cultured cells. Moreover, deslanoside suppressed the invasion and migration of PCa cell lines. Genome-wide expression profiling and bioinformatic analyses revealed that 130 genes were either upregulated or downregulated by deslanoside in both 22Rv1 and PC-3 cell lines. These genes enriched multiple cellular processes, such as response to steroid hormones, regulation of lipid metabolism, epithelial cell proliferation and its regulation, and negative regulation of cell migration. They also enriched multiple signaling pathways, such as necroptosis, MAPK, NOD-like receptor, and focal adhesion. Survival analyses of the 130 genes in the TCGA PCa database revealed that 10 of the deslanoside-downregulated genes (ITG2B, CNIH2, FBF1, PABPC1L, MMP11, DUSP9, TMEM121, SOX18, CMPK2, and MAMDC4) inversely correlated, while one deslanoside-upregulated gene (RASD1) positively correlated, with disease-free survival in PCa patients. In addition, one deslanoside-downregulated gene (ENG) inversely correlated, while three upregulated genes (JUN, MXD1, and AQP3) positively correlated with overall survival in PCa patients. Some of the 15 genes have not been implicated in cancer before. These findings provide another candidate for repurposing cardiac glycosides for anticancer drugs. They also suggest that a diverse range of molecular events underlie deslanoside's anticancer activity in PCa cells.""","""['Mingcheng Liu', 'Qingqing Huang', 'Jun A', 'Linyue Li', 'Xiawei Li', 'Zhiqian Zhang', 'Jin-Tang Dong']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancers (Basel)""","""['Acetyl-L-Carnitine downregulates invasion (CXCR4/CXCL12, MMP-9) and angiogenesis (VEGF, CXCL8) pathways in prostate cancer cells: rationale for prevention and interception strategies.', 'Total saponins from Paris forrestii (Takht) H.

First, we analysed proteomics databases and found that TG4 protein is present in human tissues beyond the prostate. Then, we studied in vitro the transamidase activity of human TG4 and its regulation using the microtitre plate method. Human TG4 has low transamidase activity which prefers slightly acidic pH and a reducing environment. It is enhanced by submicellar concentrations of SDS suggesting that membrane proximity is an important regulatory event. Human TG4 does not bind GTP as tested by GTP-agarose and BODIPY-FL-GTPγS binding, and its proteolytic activation by dispase or when expressed in AD-293 cells was not observed either.

Owing to the heterogeneity as well as various molecular subtypes, the molecular pathways underlying carcinogenesis in various forms of BC are distinct. Therefore, the advancement of alternative therapy is required to combat the ailment. Recent analyses propose that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) perform an essential function in controlling immune response, and therefore, may provide essential information about the disorder. However, their function in patients with triple-negative BC (TNBC) has not been explored in detail. Here, we analyzed the changes in the genomic expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) and lncRNA in standard control in response to cancer metastasis using publicly available single-cell RNA-Seq data. We identified a total of 197 potentially novel lncRNAs in TNBC patients of which 86 were differentially upregulated and 111 were differentially downregulated. In addition, among the 909 candidate lncRNA transcripts, 19 were significantly differentially expressed (DE) of which three were upregulated and 16 were downregulated. On the other hand, 1901 mRNA transcripts were significantly DE of which 1110 were upregulated and 791 were downregulated by TNBCs subtypes. The Gene Ontology (GO) analyses showed that some of the host genes were enriched in various biological, molecular, and cellular functions. The Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that some of the genes were involved in only one pathway of prostate cancer. The lncRNA-miRNA-gene network analysis showed that the lncRNAs TCONS_00076394 and TCONS_00051377 interacted with breast cancer-related micro RNAs (miRNAs) and the host genes of these lncRNAs were also functionally related to breast cancer.

For example, we observed PCa organoids to be less affected by cabazitaxel, abiraterone and enzalutamide as compared to corresponding single cells prior to organoid assembly. We hypothesized that three-dimensional (3D) organoid organization and the use of various 3D scaffolds impact treatment efficacy. Live-cell imaging of androgen-induced androgen receptor (AR) nuclear translocation and taxane-induced tubulin stabilization was used to investigate the impact of 3D scaffolds, spatial organoid distribution and organoid size on treatment effect. Scaffolds delayed AR translocation and tubulin stabilization, with Matrigel causing a more pronounced delay than synthetic hydrogel as well as incomplete tubulin stabilization.

Elastin is an important component of the extracellular matrix and is involved in the structure and organization of prostate tissue. The present study examined prostate cancer in a xenograft mouse model using an elastin-specific molecular probe for magnetic resonance molecular imaging. Two different tumor sizes (500 mm3 and 1000 mm3) were compared and analyzed by MRI in vivo and histologically and analytically ex vivo. The T1-weighted sequence was used in a clinical 3-T scanner to calculate the relative contrast enhancement before and after probe administration. Our results show that the use of an elastin-specific probe enables better discrimination between tumors and surrounding healthy tissue. Furthermore, specific binding of the probe to elastin fibers was confirmed by histological examination and laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Smaller tumors showed significantly higher signal intensity (p > 0.001), which correlates with the higher proportion of elastin fibers in the histological evaluation than in larger tumors. A strong correlation was seen between relative enhancement (RE) and Elastica-van Gieson staining (R2 = 0.88). RE was related to inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry data for Gd and showed a correlation (R2 = 0.78).

The mechanism by which antagonists are converted into agonists and how AR signaling is recovered by other steroids has yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we interrogated the role of bicalutamide conformation in its antagonist function and how glucocorticoids such as prednisolone and dexamethasone revive AR signaling at the molecular level by means of molecular dynamics. We found that the ''closed'' conformation of bicalutamide is essential for its antagonist function and W741 residue is forcing it into this conformation.

Cabazitaxel (CAB) has been effectively used for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). However, the immune regulatory role of CAB in the tumor microenvironment is not clear. In this context, we for the first time assessed the immunotherapeutic role of CAB in the TLR3 signalling following activation of Poly I:C in mCRPC cells.  Methods and results:   The cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of CAB with the induction of Poly I:C were determined by WST-1, Annexin V, acridine orange, RT-PCR analysis, ELISA assay and immunofluorescence staining in DU-145 mCRPC and HUVEC control cells. Our findings showed that CAB treatment with Poly I:C significantly suppressed the proliferation of DU-145 cells through the induction of apoptosis and caspase activation. Additionally, higher concentration of CAB mediated the activation of TLR3 via increased cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of TLR3, TICAM-1 and IRF-3 in mCRPC cells.  Conclusions:   Co-treatment of CAB and Poly I:C was more effective in mCRPC cells with less toxicity in control cells. However, further investigations are required to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of TLRs signalling upon CAB treatment at the molecular level to further validate the immunotherapeutic efficacy of CAB in mCRPC.""","""['Asuman Deveci Ozkan', 'Gamze Guney Eskiler', 'Suleyman Kaleli', 'Elvan Sahin']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mol Biol Rep""","""['Association between the anticancer efficacy of cabazitaxel and toll-like receptor 4 mediating signaling pathways in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Cabazitaxel Remains Active in Patients Progressing After Docetaxel Followed by Novel Androgen Receptor Pathway Targeted Therapies.', 'CAST: A retrospective analysis of cabazitaxel and abiraterone acetate sequential treatment in patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel.', 'Taxane mechanisms of action: potential implications for treatment sequencing in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Addressing taxane resistance in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a focus on chaperone proteins.', 'Chemotherapeutic properties and side-effects associated with the clinical practice of terpene alkaloids: paclitaxel, docetaxel, and cabazitaxel.', 'A β-Cyclodextrin-Based Nanoparticle with Very High Transfection Efficiency Unveils siRNA-Activated TLR3 Responses in Human Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Culture of patient-derived multicellular clusters in suspended hydrogel capsules for pre-clinical personalized drug screening.']"""

Because most nuclear receptors can be selectively activated or inactivated by small molecules, they are prominent therapeutic targets. The basic understanding of this family of transcription factors was accelerated in the 1980s upon the cloning of the first hormone receptors. During the next 20 years, a deep understanding of hormone signaling was achieved that has translated to numerous clinical applications, such as the development of standard-of-care endocrine therapies for hormonally driven breast and prostate cancers. A 2004 issue of this journal reviewed progress on elucidating the structures of nuclear receptors and their mechanisms of action.

Methods:   To retrospectively analyze the CT manifestations of 153 bladder tumor cases confirmed by paraffin pathology in our hospital and to study the difference between the benign and CT imaging features. CT indicators mainly include the number, location, morphology, calcification, bladder wall smoothness, CT value, degree of enhancement, and invasion of surrounding tissues and organs. Then, we retrospectively analyze 17 cases of CT missed diagnosis of bladder tumors, analyze related factors, and discuss the role of CT in the diagnosis of bladder tumors.  Results:   This study has shown that with the help of CT images, the diagnosis rate of bladder tumors has been greatly improved. Of the 153 patients studied, noninvasive urothelial carcinoma accounted for 18.95% of all benign and malignant bladder tumors, invasive urothelial carcinoma accounted for 67.93%, prostatic metastatic carcinoma and inflammatory myofibroblastoma accounted for 8.47%, pheochromocytoma accounted for 1.31%, inverted papilloma accounted for 1.31%, tubular choriocarcinoma accounted for 0.63%, and endocystitis accounted for 1.31%.

A responsive NIR fluorescent probe was designed to report the androgen dependence and monitor the development of castration resistance for prostate cancer.  Methods:   Intratumoral H2S in prostate cancer was closely related to castration resistance. A H2S-responsive NIR probe (HM) was developed as a dependent indicator to report the androgen dependence of prostate cancer. The specificity of HM to H2S and the influence of normal intracellular substrates to the response between H2S and HM were determined. Cell/in vivo animal imaging were performed on PC-3 and LnCAP cell/tumor bearing mice, which presented with androgen independence and androgen dependence, respectively.  Results:   When HM responded to H2S, strong fluorescence at 770 nm could be rapidly turned on in 5 min with the stokes shift as large as 200 nm. The recognition between HM and H2S showed high specificity. Neither other common substrates showed capacity to turn on HM's fluorescence, nor their existence demonstrated competition.

The Gleason score (GS) is the strongest predictive factor for PCa treatment and is embedded within semi-structured prostate biopsy narrative reports. The manual extraction of the GS is labour-intensive. The objective of our study was to explore the use of text mining techniques to automate the extraction of the GS from irregularly reported text-intensive patient reports.  Methods:   We used the associated Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine clinical terms morphology and topography codes to identify prostate biopsies with a PCa diagnosis for men aged > 30 years between 2006 and 2016 in the Gauteng Province, South Africa. We developed a text mining algorithm to extract the GS from 1000 biopsy reports with a PCa diagnosis from the National Health Laboratory Service database and validated the algorithm using 1000 biopsies from the private sector. The logical steps for the algorithm were data acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction, feature value representation, feature selection, information extraction, classification, and discovered knowledge. We evaluated the algorithm using precision, recall and F-score. The GS was manually coded by two experts for both datasets. The top five GS were reported, with the remaining scores categorised as ""Other"" for both datasets. The percentage of biopsies with a high-risk GS (≥ 8) was also reported.  Results:   The first output reported an F-score of 0.99 that improved to 1.00 after the algorithm was amended (the GS reported in clinical history was ignored). For the validation dataset, an F-score of 0.99 was reported. The most commonly reported GS were 5 + 4 = 9 (17.6%), 3 + 3 = 6 (17.5%), 4 + 3 = 7 (16.4%), 3 + 4 = 7 (14.7%) and 4 + 4 = 8 (14.2%). For the validation dataset, the most commonly reported GS were: (i) 3 + 3 = 6 (37.7%), (ii) 3 + 4 = 7 (19.4%), (iii) 4 + 3 = 7 (14.9%), (iv) 4 + 4 = 8 (10.0%) and (v) 4 + 5 = 9 (7.4%). A high-risk GS was reported for 31.8% compared to 17.4% for the validation dataset.

The main aim of this study was to investigate the equality in access to CPPs for patients with either lung, colorectal, breast or prostate cancer in Norway.  Methods:   National population-based data on individual level from 2015 to 2017 were used to study two proportions; i) patients in CPPs without the cancer diagnosis, and ii) cancer patients included in CPPs. Logistic regression was applied to examine the associations between these proportions and place of residence (hospital referral area), age, education, income, comorbidity and travel time to hospital.  Results:   Age and place of residence were the two most important factors for describing the variation in proportions. For the CPP patients, inconsistent differences were found for income and education, while for the cancer patients the probability of being included in a CPP increased with income.  Conclusions:   The age effect can be related to both the increasing risk of cancer and increasing number of GP and hospital contacts with age. The non-systematic results for CPP patients according to income and education can be interpreted as equitable access, as opposed to the systematic differences found among cancer patients in different income groups.

The aims of this study were to 1) determine the effect of self-regulatory BCTs on long-term PA maintenance, and 2) identify predictors of long-term PA maintenance in cancer survivors 12 months after participating in a six-month exercise intervention during cancer treatment.  Methods:   In a multicentre study with a 2 × 2 factorial design, the Phys-Can RCT, 577 participants with curable breast, colorectal or prostate cancer and starting their cancer treatment, were randomized to high intensity exercise with or without self-regulatory behaviour change techniques (BCTs; e.g. goal-setting and self-monitoring) or low-to-moderate intensity exercise with or without self-regulatory BCTs. Participants' level of PA was assessed at the end of the exercise intervention and 12 months later (i.e. 12-month follow-up), using a PA monitor and a PA diary. Participants were categorized as either maintainers (change in minutes/week of aerobic PA ≥ 0 and/or change in number of sessions/week of resistance training ≥0) or non-maintainers. Data on potential predictors were collected at baseline and at the end of the exercise intervention. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to answer both research questions.  Results:   A total of 301 participants (52%) completed the data assessments. A main effect of BCTs on PA maintenance was found (OR = 1.80, 95%CI [1.05-3.08]) at 12-month follow-up. Participants reporting higher health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) (OR = 1.03, 95%CI [1.00-1.06] and higher exercise motivation (OR = 1.02, 95%CI [1.00-1.04]) at baseline were more likely to maintain PA levels at 12-month follow-up. Participants with higher exercise expectations (OR = 0.88, 95%CI [0.78-0.99]) and a history of tobacco use at baseline (OR = 0.43, 95%CI [0.21-0.86]) were less likely to maintain PA levels at 12-month follow-up. Finally, participants with greater BMI increases over the course of the exercise intervention (OR = 0.63, 95%CI [0.44-0.90]) were less likely to maintain their PA levels at 12-month follow-up.  Conclusions:   Self-regulatory BCTs improved PA maintenance at 12-month follow-up and can be recommended to cancer survivors for long-term PA maintenance. Such support should be considered especially for patients with low HRQoL, low exercise motivation, high exercise expectations or with a history of tobacco use at the start of their cancer treatment, as well as for those gaining weight during their treatment. However, more experimental studies are needed to investigate the efficacy of individual or combinations of BCTs in broader clinical populations.

The aptamer (Apt) A10-3.2 can be used as a specific ligand for the early diagnosis and targeted treatment of PCa. siRNA-Apt has been used to therapeutically target PSMA-positive PCa. We aimed to synthesize a new type of molecular probe to facilitate the integration of diagnosis and treatment for PSMA-positive PCa.  Methods:   Chimeras were obtained by covalent linking PSMA Apt-A10-3.2 and the MDM2 siRNA. SHNH, a bifunctional chelating agent, was used to couple 99mTc with chimeras to synthesize a new molecular probe. Labeling efficiency, radiochemical purity, and stability were confirmed using a γ-well counter and Whatman paper No.1. SPECT imaging and biodistribution studies were performed on BALB/c mice bearing 22Rv1 or PC-3 xenografts. Tumor inhibition and cytotoxicity of Chimeras were evaluated. LNCaP, 22RV1, and PC-3 PCa cell lines were used for in vitro and in vivo experiments.  Results:   [99mTc]Tc-chimeras showed high labeling efficiency (61.47% ± 2.85%, n = 3), radiochemical purity (>95%), and stability. Biodistribution studies and SPECT imaging with 99mTc-chimeras in mice bearing 22Rv1 xenografts demonstrated a high T/M ratio (4.63 ± 0.68, n = 3) and a high T/B ratio (3.61 ± 0.7, n = 3) at 2 h post-injection. 99mTc-chimeras showed rapid renal clearance. Compared with the PBS group, tumor growth in the chimera group was significantly inhibited (P < 0.01, n = 4), but there was no significant difference in body weight (p > 0.05, n = 4).

Patients and methods:   Men diagnosed with prostate cancer in the English National Health Service between April 2014 and January 2016 were identified. Administrative data were used to identify men who had undergone a RP and those who subsequently underwent a UI procedure. The National Prostate Cancer Audit database was used to identify men who had also completed a post-treatment survey. These surveys included the Expanded Prostate Cancer Composite Index (EPIC-26). The frequency of subsequent UI procedures, within 6 months of the survey, was explored according to EPIC-26 UI scores. The relationship between 'good' (≥75) or 'bad' (≤25) EPIC-26 UI scores and perceptions of urinary bother was also explored (responses ranging from 'no problem' to 'big problem' with respect to their urinary function).  Results:   We identified 11 290 men who had undergone a RP. The 3-year cumulative incidence of UI surgery was 2.5%. After exclusions, we identified 5165 men who had also completed a post-treatment survey after a median time of 19 months (response rate 74%). A total of 481 men (9.3%) reported a 'bad' UI score and 207 men (4.0%) also reported that they had a big problem with their urinary function. In all, 47 men went on to have UI surgery within 6 months of survey completion (0.9%), of whom 93.6% had a bad UI score. Of the 71 men with the worst UI score (zero), only 11 men (15.5%) subsequently had UI surgery.

However, a few studies on the efficacy of total mesorectal excision (TME) with different robotic technologies have been reported. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of two types of robot-assisted TME (R-TME) compared with laparoscopic TME (L-TME).  Methods:   A prospective comparative study was conducted comparing da Vinci R-TME, Micro Hand S R-TME, and L-TME for rectal cancer. This study was registered with ""Clinicaltrials.gov"" (ID: NCT02752698) and approved by the Association for the Accreditation of Human Research Protection Program (AAHRPP) (Project number: T16007). Between January 2017 and May 2019, patients with rectal cancer (cT1-3NxM0) were prospectively registered in the Third Xiangya Hospital. The integrity of the TME sample served as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included the involvement of the circumferential and distal resection margins (CRM and DRM), number of lymph nodes retrieved, blood loss, operative time, conversion rate, comprehensive complication index score, the International Prostate Symptom score, the International Index of Erectile Function, and the Female Sexual Function Index.  Results:   Of 134 patients with rectal cancer (74 males, mean age [SD] 59.1 ± 8.27 years), 46 patients underwent laparoscopic TME, 45 patients underwent da Vinci R-TME, and 43 patients underwent Micro Hand S R-TME. There were no differences in results between the two types of R-TME. Compared with laparoscopic TME, significant reductions in blood loss (median 65.50 ml da Vinci; median 66.54 ml Micro Hand S vs median 95.04 ml L-TME p = 0.037 and p = 0.041, respectively) and conversion rate (2.2% da Vinci; 2.3% Micro Hand S vs 6.8% L-TME p = 0,040 for the comparison daVinci L-TME and p = 0.038 for the comparison Micro Hand S vs. L-TME) with da Vinci Si and Micro Hand S R-TME were noted, and significant increases in operation time (230.05 min da Vinci; 235.03 min Micro Hand S vs. 205.53 min L-TME p = 0.045 and p = 0.043, respectively) was observed. Additionally, more patients underwent TME with sphincter-preserving methods in the two R-TME groups based on the type of operation (da Vinci 97.7%; Micro Hand S 97.9% vs. L-TME 82% resulting in p = 0.033 for the comparison daVinci L-TME and p = 0.035 for the comparison Micro Hand S vs. L-TME). In comparison with L-TME, there was a larger number of lymph nodes retrieved (da Vinci mean 17.54; Micro Hand S mean 17.32 vs. L-TME mean 14.96 p = 0.031 for the comparison daVinci L-TME and p = 0.033 for the comparison Micro Hand S vs L-TME) and less blood loss (da Vinci mean 65.50 ml; Micro Hand S mean 66.54 ml vs. L-TME mean 95.04 ml, p = 0.037 for the comparison daVinci L-TME and p = 0.041 for the comparison Micro Hand S vs. L-TME), and incidence of severe postoperative complications was similar among three TME groups except for the earlier recovery of urogenital function (mean IPSS score da Vinci 7.73±1.35; Micro Hand S7.75±1.47 vs L-TME 14.26±1.41 p<0.001 for the comparison da Vinci L-TME and p<0.001 for the comparison Microhand S vs L-TME) in the two R-TME groups.

To clinically implement such complex treatment procedures, however, specific end-to-end tests are required that are able to validate the overall accuracy of all treatment steps from pre-treatment imaging to dose delivery.Approach.In this study, an end-to-end test of a fractionated and online adapted MRgRT prostate irradiation was performed using the so-called ADAM-PETer phantom. The phantom was adapted to perform 3D polymer gel (PG) dosimetry in the prostate and rectum. Furthermore, thermoluminescence detectors (TLDs) were placed at the center and on the surface of the prostate for additional dose measurements as well as for an external dose renormalization of the PG. For the end-to-end test, a total of five online adapted irradiations were applied in sequence with different bladder and rectum fillings, respectively.Main results.A good agreement of measured and planned dose was found represented by highγ-index passing rates (3%/3mmcriterion) of the PG evaluation of98.9%in the prostate and93.7%in the rectum. TLDs used for PG renormalization at the center of the prostate showed a deviation of-2.3%.Significance.The presented end-to-end test, which allows for 3D dose verification in the prostate and rectum, demonstrates the feasibility and accuracy of fractionated and online-adapted prostate irradiations in presence of inter-fractional anatomy changes. Such tests are of high clinical importance for the commissioning of new image-guided treatment procedures such as online adaptive MRgRT.""","""['A Elter', 'C Rippke', 'W Johnen', 'P Mann', 'E Hellwich', 'A Schwahofer', 'S Dorsch', 'C Buchele', 'S Klüter', 'C P Karger']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Technical Note: On the feasibility of performing dosimetry in target and organ at risk using polymer dosimetry gel and thermoluminescence detectors in an anthropomorphic, deformable, and multimodal pelvis phantom.', 'An end-to-end test for MR-guided online adaptive radiotherapy.', 'End-to-end test of an online adaptive treatment procedure in MR-guided radiotherapy using a phantom with anthropomorphic structures.', 'Medical physics challenges in clinical MR-guided radiotherapy.', 'MRI-GUIDED RADIOTHERAPY FOR PROSTATE CANCER: A NEW PARADIGM.', 'Online adaptive radiotherapy and dose delivery accuracy: A retrospective analysis.', 'End-to-End QA with Polymer Gel Dosimeter for Photon Beam Radiation Therapy.', 'Chemical Overview of Gel Dosimetry Systems: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Radiation Dosimetry by Use of Radiosensitive Hydrogels and Polymers: Mechanisms, State-of-the-Art and Perspective from 3D to 4D.', 'Robustness and reproducibility of an artificial intelligence-assisted online segmentation and adaptive planning process for online adaptive radiation therapy.']"""

The diabetic model was produced in Copenhagen rats using a single dose of streptozotocin (65 mg/kg), while prostate cancer was induced through subcutaneous inoculation of 2 × 104 Mat-LyLu cells into the animals. At the end of the experimental period, testicular tissues with a close functional relationship to the prostate were collected. Histological evaluation found moderate to severe damage to testes following the diabetes and cancer process. Histopathological and biochemical impairments were observed in the early stage of prostate cancer, which were increased in the diabetic animals. Metformin administration reversed these injuries and provided substantial protection of the testes. In particular, metformin had protective effects on tissue damage, apoptosis, oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity.

However, approximately 10% of primary prostate cancer are invisible on PSMA-PET (exhibit no or minimal uptake). In this work, we investigated whether machine learning-based radiomics models derived from PSMA-PET images could predict invisible intraprostatic lesions on 68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET in patients with primary prostate cancer.  Methods:   In this retrospective study, patients with or without prostate cancer who underwent 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT and presented negative on PSMA-PET image at either of two different institutions were included: institution 1 (between 2017 and 2020) for the training set and institution 2 (between 2019 and 2020) for the external test set. Three random forest (RF) models were built using selected features extracted from standard PET images, delayed PET images, and both standard and delayed PET images. Then, subsequent tenfold cross-validation was performed. In the test phase, the three RF models and PSA density (PSAD, cut-off value: 0.15 ng/ml/ml) were tested with the external test set. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated for the models and PSAD. The AUCs of the radiomics model and PSAD were compared.  Results:   A total of 64 patients (39 with prostate cancer and 25 with benign prostate disease) were in the training set, and 36 (21 with prostate cancer and 15 with benign prostate disease) were in the test set. The average AUCs of the three RF models from tenfold cross-validation were 0.87 (95% CI: 0.72, 1.00), 0.86 (95% CI: 0.63, 1.00), and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.69, 1.00), respectively. In the test set, the AUCs of the three trained RF models and PSAD were 0.903 (95% CI: 0.830, 0.975), 0.856 (95% CI: 0.748, 0.964), 0.925 (95% CI:0.838, 1.00), and 0.662 (95% CI: 0.510, 0.813).

Methods:   PSMA-617 freeze-dried kit was formulated and used for the preparation of 177Lu-PSMA-617 clinical dose with high radiochemical purity using low/medium specific activity 177Lu. Detailed radiochemical studies were performed to determine the maximum activity and volume of 177LuCl3, which can be added in the kit for the formulation of 177Lu-PSMA-617. Studies were also performed to determine the shelf life of the kit to ensure its long-term usage. Studies were performed in buffer as well as human serum medium to determine the stability of the 177Lu-PSMA-617 complex after storing in respective media up to 7 days postpreparation. About ten patient doses of 177Lu-PSMA-617 were administered, and posttherapy scans were acquired.  Results:   The formulated freeze-dried kit of PSMA-617 could be radiolabeled with an average percentage radiochemical purity > 98.53 ± 0.38.

How tumor-induced bone formation enhances PCa progression is not known. We have previously shown that PCa-induced bone originates from endothelial cells (ECs) that have undergone endothelial-to-osteoblast (EC-to-OSB) transition by tumor-secreted bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4). Here, we show that EC-to-OSB transition leads to changes in the tumor microenvironment that increases the metastatic potential of PCa cells. We found that conditioned medium (CM) from EC-OSB hybrid cells increases the migration, invasion, and survival of PC3-mm2 and C4-2B4 PCa cells. Quantitative mass spectrometry (Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation) identified Tenascin C (TNC) as one of the major proteins secreted from EC-OSB hybrid cells. TNC expression in tumor-induced OSBs was confirmed by immunohistochemistry of MDA PCa-118b xenograft and human bone metastasis specimens. Mechanistically, BMP4 increases TNC expression in EC-OSB cells through the Smad1-Notch/Hey1 pathway. How TNC promotes PCa metastasis was next interrogated by in vitro and in vivo studies. In vitro studies showed that a TNC-neutralizing antibody inhibits EC-OSB-CM-mediated PCa cell migration and survival. TNC knockdown decreased, while the addition of recombinant TNC or TNC overexpression increased migration and anchorage-independent growth of PC3 or C4-2b cells. When injected orthotopically, PC3-mm2-shTNC clones decreased metastasis to bone, while C4-2b-TNC-overexpressing cells increased metastasis to lymph nodes. TNC enhances PCa cell migration through α5β1 integrin-mediated YAP/TAZ inhibition. These studies elucidate that tumor-induced stromal reprogramming generates TNC that enhances PCa metastasis and suggest that TNC may be a target for PCa therapy.""","""['Yu-Chen Lee', 'Song-Chang Lin', 'Guoyu Yu', 'Ming Zhu', 'Jian H Song', 'Keith Rivera', 'Darryl J Pappin', 'Christopher J Logothetis', 'Theocharis Panaretakis', 'Guocan Wang', 'Li-Yuan Yu-Lee', 'Sue-Hwa Lin']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Endothelial-to-osteoblast transition in normal mouse bone development.', 'Multiple pathways coordinating reprogramming of endothelial cells into osteoblasts by BMP4.', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor Activation Reduces Metastatic Prostate Cancer Bone Lesions by Blocking the Endothelial-to-Osteoblast Transition.', 'Osteoblastic Factors in Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis.', 'Tenascin-C Function in Glioma: Immunomodulation and Beyond.', 'Advances in landscape and related therapeutic targets of the prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'Reprogramming anchorage dependency by adherent-to-suspension transition promotes metastatic dissemination.', 'Endothelial-to-osteoblast transition in normal mouse bone development.', 'Current methods for studying metastatic potential of tumor cells.', 'Emerging Role of YAP and the Hippo Pathway in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Unlike other solid organ tumours, tumour volume (TV) is not routinely used aside from crude estimates such as maximum cancer core length. The aim of this study is to assess the role of TV as a marker for oncological outcomes in high-risk non-metastatic prostate cancer.  Methods:   A prospectively maintained database of patients undergoing minimally invasive (laparoscopic or robot-assisted laparoscopic) radical prostatectomy at a UK centre between 2007 and 2019 were analysed. A total of 251 patients with NCCN high or very high-risk prostate cancer were identified. Primary outcome measure was time to biochemical recurrence (BCR) and the secondary outcome was time to treatment failure (TTF). TV was measured on the pathological specimen using the stacking method. Multivariable cox regression analysis was used to identify factors predicting BCR and TFF. TV as a predictor of BCR and TFF was further analysed through time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were used to evaluate TV cut-off scores.  Results:   Median follow up was 4.50 years. Four factors were associated with BCR and TFF on multivariable analysis (TV, pathological GG, pathological T stage, positive margin >3 mm). Area under the Curve (AUC) for TV as a predictor of BCR and TTF at 5 years was 0.71 and 0.75, respectively. Including all 4 variables in the model increased AUC to 0.84 and 0.85 for BCR and TFF. A 2.50 cm TV cut off demonstrated a significance difference in time to BCR, p < 0.001.

Some of the former type of variants (e.g., BRCA2 mutations) predispose particularly to aggressive prostate cancer and confer poorer prognoses compared to men who do not carry mutations. Molecularly targeted treatments such as PARP inhibitors have improved outcomes in men carrying somatic and/or germline DNA repair gene mutations. Ongoing clinical trials are exploring other molecular targeted approaches based on prostate cancer somatic alterations. Genome wide association studies have identified >250 loci that associate with prostate cancer risk. Multi-ancestry analyses have identified shared as well as population specific risk SNPs. Prostate cancer risk SNPs can be used to estimate a polygenic risk score (PRS) to determine an individual's genetic risk of prostate cancer. The odds ratio of prostate cancer development in men whose PRS lies in the top 1% of the risk profile ranges from 9 to 11. Ongoing studies are investigating the utility of a prostate cancer PRS to target population screening to those at highest risk. With the advent of personalized medicine and development of DNA sequencing technologies, access to clinical genetic testing is increasing, and oncology guidelines from bodies such as NCCN and ESMO have been updated to provide criteria for germline testing of ""at risk"" healthy men as well as those with prostate cancer.

The identification of cancer stem cells (CSCs) driving tumor growth and metastasis is the primary objective of biomarker discovery in aggressive prostate cancer (PCa). In this context, we analyzed TET1 expression in PCa.  Methods:   A large-scale immunohistochemical analysis of TET1 was performed in normal prostate (NOR) and PCa using conventional slides (50 PCa specimens) and tissue microarrays (669 NOR and 1371 PCa tissue cores from 371 PCa specimens). Western blotting, RT-qPCR, and 450 K methylation array analyses were performed on PCa cell lines. Genome-wide correlation, gene regulatory network, and functional genomics studies were performed using publicly available data sources and bioinformatics tools.  Results:   In NOR, TET1 was exclusively expressed in normal cytokeratin 903 (CK903)-positive basal cells. In PCa, TET1 was frequently detected in alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR)-positive tumor cell clusters and was detectable at all tumor stages and Gleason scores. Pearson's correlation analyses of PCa revealed 626 TET1-coactivated genes (r > 0.5) primarily encoding chromatin remodeling and mitotic factors. Moreover, signaling pathways regulating antiviral processes (62 zinc finger, ZNF, antiviral proteins) and the pluripotency of stem cells were activated. A significant proportion of detected genes exhibited TET1-correlated promoter hypomethylation. There were 161 genes encoding transcription factors (TFs), of which 133 were ZNF-TFs with promoter binding sites in TET1 and in the vast majority of TET1-coactivated genes.  Conclusions:   TET1-expressing cells are an integral part of PCa and may represent CSCs with oncogenic potential.""","""['U Schagdarsurengin#', 'C Luo#', 'H Slanina', 'D Sheridan', 'S Füssel', 'N Böğürcü-Seidel', 'S Gattenloehner', 'G B Baretton', 'L C Hofbauer', 'F Wagenlehner', 'T Dansranjav']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Clin Epigenetics""","""['Resveratrol inhibits the tumor migration and invasion by upregulating TET1 and reducing TIMP2/3 methylation in prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Genomic and epigenomic analysis of high-risk prostate cancer reveals changes in hydroxymethylation and TET1.', 'Alterations of regulatory factors and DNA methylation pattern in thyroid cancer.', 'Multiple Functions of Ten-eleven Translocation 1 during Tumorigenesis.', 'Advances in the DNA methylation hydroxylase TET1.', 'Epigenome-wide DNA methylation in leukocytes and toenail metals: The normative aging study.']"""

Machine learning classifiers have been explored to augment the scope and efficiency of the traditional radiotherapy treatment planning QA process. However, one important gap in relying on classifiers for QA of radiotherapy treatment plans is the lack of understanding behind a specific classifier prediction. We develop explanation methods to understand the decisions of two automated QA classifiers: (1) a region of interest (ROI) segmentation/labeling classifier, and (2) a treatment plan acceptance classifier. For each classifier, a local interpretable model-agnostic explanation (LIME) framework and a novel adaption of team-based Shapley values framework are constructed. We test these methods in datasets for two radiotherapy treatment sites (prostate and breast), and demonstrate the importance of evaluating QA classifiers using interpretable machine learning approaches. We additionally develop a notion of explanation consistency to assess classifier performance. Our explanation method allows for easy visualization and human expert assessment of classifier decisions in radiotherapy QA. Notably, we find that our team-based Shapley approach is more consistent than LIME. The ability to explain and validate automated decision-making is critical in medical treatments. This analysis allows us to conclude that both QA classifiers are moderately trustworthy and can be used to confirm expert decisions, though the current QA classifiers should not be viewed as a replacement for the human QA process.""","""['Yunsheng Chen', 'Dionne M Aleman', 'Thomas G Purdie', 'Chris McIntosh']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Machine learning-generated decision boundaries for prediction and exploration of patient-specific quality assurance failures in stereotactic radiosurgery plans.', 'The structural similarity index for IMRT quality assurance: radiomics-based error classification.', 'SuPART: supervised projective adapted resonance theory for automatic quality assurance approval of radiotherapy treatment plans.', 'Integration of AI and Machine Learning in Radiotherapy QA.', 'Applications of machine and deep learning to patient-specific IMRT/VMAT quality assurance.', 'Utilization of model-agnostic explainable artificial intelligence frameworks in oncology: a narrative review.']"""

Methods:   Patients with PCa undergoing 68Ga-PSMA-PET/MRI and mpMRI during January 2016 to February 2019 were retrospectively included. Two readers each on 68Ga-PSMA-PET/MRI or mpMRI rated extraprostatic extension (≥T3) and regional lymph-node-metastasis (N1) on a Likert-scale. A fifth reader measured tumor volume, maximum diameter, and capsular contact length on mpMRI. Probability of lymph-node-metastasis was additionally calculated using the 2018 Briganti model. Interobserver-agreement was assessed by squared Cohen's kappa, and diagnostic accuracy was determined using radical prostatectomy (n = 35/49) as reference standard.  Results:   49 patients (median age 66 years [IQR: 61-72 years]) were evaluated. Interobserver-agreement for mpMRI and 68Ga-PSMA-PET/MRI was: ≥T3: κ = 0.58/0.47; N1: κ = 0.55/0.92. Diagnostic accuracy for mpMRI vs 68Ga-PSMA-PET/MRI readers for ≥ T3 was AUC: 0.72, 0.62 vs 0.71, 0.72 (p > 0.38) and for N1 was AUC: 0.39, 0.55 vs 0.72, 0.78 (p < 0.01). Quantitative parameters delivered diagnostic accuracies of: AUC: 0.70-0.72 for ≥ T3. The 2018 Briganti model achieved an AUC of 0.89 for N1.  Conclusions:   Interreader-agreement regarding ≥ T3 was similar for mpMRI and 68Ga-PSMA-PET/MRI while for N1 it was higher for 68Ga-PSMA-PET/MRI.

Fifteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used as instrumental variables for circulating adiponectin. Genetic predisposition to high circulating adiponectin was strongly associated with low femoral neck bone mineral density (FN-BMD, beta-estimate: -0.015, 95% CI: -0.023 to -0.006, SE: 0.004, P-value = 0.001), low forearm BMD (FA-BMD, beta-estimate: -0.027, 95% CI: -0.050 to -0.004, SE: 0.012, P-value = 0.023) and increased risk of breast cancer (beta-estimate: 0.011, 95% CI: 0.001 to 0.022, SE: 0.005, P-value = 0.031).

In addition, statins have been reported to suppress the expression of androgen receptors (ARs) in prostate cancer cell lines. In this study, we investigated a combination therapy of novel AR antagonists and statin, simvastatin, for CRPC.  Methods:   LNCaP, 22Rv1, and PC-3 human prostate cancer cell lines were used. We developed androgen-independent LNCaP cells (LNCaP-LA). Microarray analysis was performed, followed by pathway analysis, and mRNA and protein expression was evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis, respectively. Cell viability was determined by MTS assay and cell counts. All evaluations were performed on cells treated with simvastatin and with or without AR antagonists (enzalutamide, apalutamide, and darolutamide).  Results:   The combination of darolutamide and simvastatin most significantly suppressed proliferation in LNCaP-LA and 22Rv1 cells. In a 22Rv1-derived mouse xenograft model, the combination of darolutamide and simvastatin enhanced the inhibition of cell proliferation. In LNCaP-LA cells, the combination of darolutamide and simvastatin led to reduction in the mRNA expression of the androgen-stimulated genes, KLK2 and PSA; however, this reduction in expression did not occur in 22Rv1 cells. The microarray data and pathway analyses showed that the number of differentially expressed genes in the darolutamide and simvastatin-treated 22Rv1 cells was the highest in the pathway termed ""role of cell cycle."" Consequently, we focused our efforts on the cell cycle regulator polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), and cell cycle division 25C (CDC25C). In 22Rv1 cells, the combination of darolutamide and simvastatin suppressed the mRNA and protein expression of these three genes. In addition, in PC-3 cells (which lack AR expression), the combination of simvastatin and darolutamide enhanced the suppression of cell proliferation and expression of these genes.  Conclusions:   Simvastatin alters the expression of many genes involved in the cell cycle in CRPC cells. Thus, the combination of novel AR antagonists (darolutamide) and simvastatin can potentially affect CRPC growth through both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent mechanisms.""","""['Hiroshi Nakayama', 'Yoshitaka Sekine', 'Daisuke Oka', 'Yoshiyuki Miyazawa', 'Seiji Arai', 'Hidekazu Koike', 'Hiroshi Matsui', 'Yasuhiro Shibata', 'Kazuhiro Suzuki']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Moving Towards Precision Urologic Oncology: Targeting Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer and Mutated Forms of the Androgen Receptor Using the Novel Inhibitor Darolutamide (ODM-201).', 'Interleukin-23 Represses the Level of Cell Senescence Induced by the Androgen Receptor Antagonists Enzalutamide and Darolutamide in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Darolutamide is a potent androgen receptor antagonist with strong efficacy in prostate cancer models.', 'Darolutamide in hormone-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Second-Generation Androgen Receptor Antagonists as Hormonal Therapeutics for Three Forms of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Chronic condition medication adherence was defined as a proportion of days covered ≥ 80%. Provider team structure was measured using two factors capturing the number of providers seen and the historical amount of patient sharing among providers. Linear regressions relying on within-survivor variation were run separately for each cancer site, chronic condition, and follow-up period.  Results:   The number of providers and patient sharing among providers increased after cancer diagnosis relative to the non-cancer control group. Changes in provider team complexity explained only small changes in medication adherence. Provider team effects were statistically insignificant in 13 of 17 analytic samples with significant changes in adherence. Statistically significant provider team effects were small in magnitude (<0.5 percentage points).

Methods:   This was a randomized, parallel-group, open-label, phase 2, and non-inferiority trial. Chemotherapy-naïve patients with mCRPC and high PSMA-expressing lesions on 68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT were randomly assigned in 1:1 ratio to 177Lu-PSMA-617 (6.0-7.4 GBq/cycle, every 8 weeks, up to 4 cycles) or docetaxel (75 mg/m2/cycle, every 3 weeks, up to 10 cycles). The primary end-point was best prostate-specific antigen response rate (PSA-RR), defined according to Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group-3 as proportion of patients achieving ≥ 50% decline in PSA from baseline. Non-inferiority margin of - 15% was pre-specified for PSA-RR.  Results:   Between December 2019 and March 2021, 40 of the 45 patients assessed for eligibility underwent randomization. Fifteen of 20 patients in 177Lu-PSMA-617 arm and 20/20 patients in docetaxel arm received treatment per protocol. Of these, best PSA-RR in the 177Lu-PSMA-617 arm was 60% (9/15) versus 40% (8/20) in the docetaxel arm. The difference in the PSA-RRs between the two arms was 20% (95% confidence interval, CI: - 12-47, P = 0.25), meeting the pre-specified criterion for non-inferiority in per-protocol analysis. Further, progression-free survival rates at 6 months were 30% and 20% in the 177Lu-PSMA-617 and docetaxel arms respectively (difference 10%, 95% CI: - 18-38, P = 0.50).

Methods:   We enrolled 449 patients with breast, prostate, and colon cancer at beginning (T0) and end (T1) of a 3-week inpatient rehabilitation and 3 (T2) and 9 (T3) months after discharge. We explored depression (PHQ-2), anxiety (GAD-2), emotional functioning (EORTC QLQ-C30), fear of progression (FoP-Q-SF), and global quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30) using structuring equation models. Furthermore, we evaluated self-reports about expressing needs and utilization of professional help at follow-up.  Results:   Patients with unexpressed needs (24.3%, n = 107) showed decreased mental health compared to other patients (e.g., depression: d T0 = 0.32, d T1-T3 = 0.39). They showed a significant decline in global quality of life at discharge and follow-up (d = 0.28). Furthermore, they had a higher need for support (Cramer's V T2 = 0.10, T3 = 0.15), talked less about their needs (Cramer's V T2 = 0.18), and made less use of different health care services at follow-up.  Conclusion:   Unexpressed needs in cancer patients may be a risk factor for decreased mental health, quality of life, and non-utilization of professional help in the long term. Further research should clarify causal relationships and focus on this specific group of patients to improve cancer care.""","""['Verena Heß', 'Karin Meng', 'Thomas Schulte', 'Silke Neuderth', 'Jürgen Bengel', 'Hermann Faller', 'Michael Schuler']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Psychooncology""","""[""Prevalence and predictors of cancer patients' unexpressed needs in the admission interview of inpatient rehabilitation."", 'Improvement of quality of life and psychological distress after inpatient cancer rehabilitation : Results of a\xa0longitudinal observational study.', 'Symptom Burden and Palliative Care Needs of Patients with Incurable Cancer at Diagnosis and During the Disease Course.', 'Home-based multidimensional survivorship programmes for breast cancer survivors.', 'The EORTC QLQ-C30 Summary Score as Prognostic Factor for Survival of Patients with Cancer in the ""Real-World"": Results from the Population-Based PROFILES Registry.']"""

Patients and methods:   Patients with histologically-proven, previously-untreated mCNPC received ADT plus docetaxel, 40 mg/m2. Docetaxel was repeated every 2 weeks, up to 12 cycles. Endpoints included castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)-free survival, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, and safety.  Results:   A total of 42 patients were registered and analyzed for final outcomes. Of the 42 patients, 36 (86%) completed the 12 planned cycles of docetaxel plus ADT. During a median follow up of 25 months, all but two patients (95%) achieved a PSA response with a nadir PSA level of 0.42 ng/ml (range 0.01-1280.87). The median CRPC-free survival was 26.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 20.9-32.0) with a one-year CRPC-free rate of 79% (33 patients, 95% CI 66-91). Multivariable analysis revealed that the performance status of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0 was independently associated with longer CRPC-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.27, 95% CI 0.07-0.99). The most common adverse events of any grade were anemia (95%), followed by nail changes (33%), fatigue (29%), and oral mucositis (26%). Severe (grade 3 or higher) adverse events were infrequent: pneumonitis (n = 2), diarrhea (n = 1), and neutropenia (n = 1).

The aim of this study is to correlate MetS with PCa diagnosis and Gleason score (GS) in patients undergoing transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.  Materials and methods:   This is a prospective, single-center study including 378 patients who underwent transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy in our department during the years from 2018 to 2019.

Multiple variables such as the presence of MetS and its components were evaluated in correlation to the presence of PCa and PCa characteristics. Statistical analysis was performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics v.23 program.  Results:   Mean PSA value was 8.7 ng/dl in the PCa group and 7.1 ng/dl in the non PCa group, respectively. MetS was diagnosed in 108 patients (54.8%) with PCa and 80 patients (44.2%) without PCa and the difference was statistically significant. Hypertriglyceridemia was the MetS component with statistically higher frequency in PCa patients. Furthermore, the prevalence of MetS was higher in higher Gleason score PCa (GS ≥ 4+3) patients vs lower Gleason score PCa (GS ≤ 3+4) patients. More specifically, MetS, hypertriglyceridemia, and low HDL levels were independent factors associated with higher Gleason score PCa (GS ≥ 4+3).

Few studies analyze this peculiar group of patients, and hence we sought to investigate the outcome of RARP in post-TURP men. We interrogated our prospectively maintained database containing 643 patients who underwent RARP from January 2012 to December 2020. We matched 36 men with prior history of TURP consecutively to 72 men without prior TURP. The groups were matched for age, body mass index (BMI), Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), serum PSA, International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade groups and clinical stage. Men with prior history of stricture surgeries, pelvic radiation, ablative laser procedures, Urolift and Rezum were excluded from the study. Fisher's Exact test/Chi-square was used for the comparison of categorical variables. Mann-Whitney test (Independent group/Unpaired data) and Wilcoxon sign rank test (for paired data) were employed to analyze continuous variables. The complication rates, median day of drain removal and length of hospital stay were similar between the groups.

As a dominant-negative oncogene, PCA3 negatively regulates the expression of tumor suppressor PRUNE2 (a human homolog of the Drosophila prune gene) gene. Although interaction between PCA3-PRUNE2 was clearly reported, the precise mechanism how PCA3 is upregulated in prostate cancer remained highly elusive. Accordingly, here we aimed demonstrate the role of microRNAs in PCA3 upregulation and interplay between these miRNAs and PCA3-PRUNE2 axis.  Methods and results:   We evaluated expression of PCA3, PRUNE2 and miRNAs by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Overexpression and silencing of miRNAs were achieved by synthetic miRNA mimics and inhibitors, respectively. Colony formation, migration, apoptosis, and cell cycle assays were performed to reveal the effects of miRNA modulation. We identified that PCA3 expression was significantly downregulated in both prostate cancer tissues and cells and inversely correlated with the expressions of miR-19a and miR-421. Restoring the functions of miR-19a and miR-421 by miRNA mimics significantly downregulated the expression of PCA3 and promoted apoptosis and cell cycle blockade and interfered with the proliferation and migration in prostate cancer cells. Conversely, silencing the expressions of these miRNAs yielded the opposite effect.  Conclusions:   Collectively, our results uncover a previously unrecognized novel mechanism on PCA3 upregulation in prostate cancer and proved that miR-19a and miR-421 might be responsible for the increased expression of PCA3, indicating that both miRNAs might be novel candidates for prostate cancer diagnosis and therapy.""","""['Esra Bozgeyik', 'Sayad Kocahan', 'Ebru Temiz', 'Haydar Bagis']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mol Biol Rep""","""['PRUNE2 is a human prostate cancer suppressor regulated by the intronic long noncoding RNA PCA3.', 'Dysregulation of the PRUNE2/PCA3 genetic axis in human prostate cancer: from experimental discovery to validation in two independent patient cohorts.', 'Long noncoding RNA PCA3 regulates prostate cancer through sponging miR-218-5p and modulating high mobility group box 1.', 'Expression of PRUNE2 mRNA and its positive correlation with non-coding RNA PCA3 in leiomyosarcoma.', 'Upregulation of long noncoding RNA FERRE promoted growth and invasion of breast cancer through modulating miR-19a-5p/EZH2 axis.', 'Non-coding RNAs: the silent regulators of health and diseases.', 'PRUNE2 inhibits progression of colorectal cancer in vitro and in vivo.']"""

Methods:   33 patients with primary untreated bladder cancer underwent CECT followed by preoperative multiparametric 3.0 T MRI between July 2019 and August 2020 and were enrolled in this retrospective study. Two radiologists initially performed staging on the CECT image data sets and - blinded to CT results - on subsequent mpMRI. BCs were staged according to the VI-RADS scoring system. Postoperative pathology was correlated to the VI-RADS score and the CECT results. The performance of VI-RADS in determining detrusor muscle invasion was analyzed using a receiver operating characteristic curve. Based on the histopathology, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for muscle invasiveness between both image modalities were compared using the Chi square test.  Results:   A total of 33 patients (29 male, median age 70 years, IQR: 59-81 years) were included. 10 tumors were categorized as non-muscle invasive (30%) and 23 as muscle invasive BC (70%) in final histology. Tumor stages were correctly assigned as being either muscle invasive or non-muscle invasive on both CECT and mpMRI with regard to both early and late stages of BC (Ta-Tis and T3a-T4b). T-stages bordering the histopathologic limits of muscle invasiveness (T1-T2a-b) resulted in overestimation of muscle invasion in 43% of cases (VI-RADS 3-4) for the mpMRI image data sets and in an underestimation of muscle invasion in up to 55.5% of cases analysing the CECT data.

Currently, multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in mTOR gene (rs2295080, rs17036508 and rs1034528), mLST8 gene (rs3160 and rs26865) and RPTOR gene (rs1062935, rs3751932, rs3751834, rs12602885) have been extensively studied for their associations with cancer risk. However, the results remained inconclusive and conflicting. Therefore, we here performed a meta-analysis of all available studies to investigate the association between these SNPs and cancer risk.  Methods:   Up to April 2021, 25 related publications were retrieved and included in this meta-analysis. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated by fixed or random effects models were applied to assess the strength of association. Trial Sequential Analysis (TSA) was conducted to weaken the random error and enhance the reliability of evidence.  Results:   After Bonferroni correction, it was revealed that rs3160, rs26865, rs1062935, rs3751932, rs3751834 and rs10602885 were not associated with cancer risk. However, rs17036508 and rs1034528 showed significant association with total cancer risk. A significant association was also found between rs2295080 and total cancer risk, and stratified analysis by cancer type suggested that rs2295080 was specifically associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia risk, prostate cancer risk, and breast cancer risk.  Conclusions:   The present meta-analysis suggested that the rs2295080, rs17036508 and rs1034528 polymorphisms in mTOR gene may be the susceptive factors for cancer development, while the target genetic polymorphisms in mLST8 gene or RPTOR gene may not be associated with cancer risk. However, these findings remain to be confirmed or further reinforced in large and well-designed studies in different ethnic populations.""","""['Xiaoling Lu', 'Meitong Liu', 'Yuxiao Liao', 'Chao Huang', 'Longlong Chai', 'Yuchen Jin', 'Qiantao Xiong', 'Bifeng Chen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Pathol Res Pract""","""['Genetic polymorphisms of mTOR and cancer risk: a systematic review and updated meta-analysis.', 'Polymorphisms of mTORC1 genes and risk of primary colorectal adenocarcinoma in Chinese populations.', 'Polymorphisms in mTORC1 genes modulate risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in eastern Chinese populations.', 'Polymorphisms in the mTOR gene and risk of sporadic prostate cancer in an Eastern Chinese population.', 'Association between HIF-1α C1772T/G1790A polymorphisms and cancer susceptibility: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis based on 40 case-control studies.', 'Association of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway autophagy-related gene polymorphisms with pulmonary tuberculosis susceptibility in a Chinese population.']"""

We have developed an open-source class library with the aim to improve efficiency and consistency for automated treatment planning in radiation therapy.  Methods and materials:   An open-source class library has been developed that interprets clinical templates within a commercial treatment planning system into a treatment plan for automated planning. This code was leveraged for the automated planning of 39 patients and retrospectively compared with the 78 clinically approved manual plans.  Results:   From the initial 39 patients, 74 of 78 plans were successfully generated without manual intervention. The target dose was more homogeneous for automated plans, with an average homogeneity index of 3.30 for manual plans versus 3.11 for automated plans (P = .107). The generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) was decreased in the femurs and rectum for automated plans, with a mean gEUD of 3746 cGy versus 3338 cGy (P ≤ 0.001) and 5761 cGy versus 5634 cGy (P ≤ 0.001) for the femurs and rectum, respectively. Dose metrics for the bladder and rectum (V6500 cGy and V4000 cGy) showed recognizable but insignificant improvements. All automated plans delivered for quality assurance passed a gamma analysis (>95%), with an average composite pass rate of 99.3% for pelvis plans and 98.8% for prostate plans. Deliverability parameters such as total monitor units and aperture complexity indicated deliverable plans.  Conclusions:   Prostate cancer and pelvic node radiation therapy can be automated using volumetric modulated arc therapy planning and clinical templates based on a standardized clinical workflow. The class library developed in this study conveniently interfaced between the plan template and the treatment planning system to automatically generate high-quality plans on customizable templates.""","""['Matthew C Schmidt', 'Eleanor A Pryser', 'Brian C Baumann', 'Mahmoud M Yaqoub', 'Caleb A Raman', 'Peter Szentivanyi', 'Jeff M Michalski', 'Hiram A Gay', 'Nels C Knutson', 'Geoffrey Hugo', 'Erno Sajo', 'Piotr Zygmanski', 'Thomas Mazur', 'Joseph Dise', 'Jochen Cammin', 'Eric Laugeman', 'Francisco J Reynoso']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Automated volumetric modulated arc therapy planning for whole pelvic prostate radiotherapy.', 'Evaluation of VMAT Planning Strategies for Prostate Patients with Bilateral Hip Prosthesis.', 'First fully automated planning solution for robotic radiosurgery - comparison with automatically planned volumetric arc therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Automated Plan Checking Software Demonstrates Continuous and Sustained Improvements in Safety and Quality: A 3-year Longitudinal Analysis.', 'Advances in Automated Treatment Planning.', 'Clinical application of a template-guided automated planning routine.']"""

Methods:   A discrete-event simulation model was developed using evidence from published randomized trials. Health outcomes were measured in life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs were included from a public payer perspective in Australian dollars. Outcomes were discounted at 5% over a lifetime horizon. Probabilistic and scenario analyses quantified parameter and structural uncertainty.  Results:   A total of 60% of patients in the AS arm eventually received radical treatment (surgery or radiotherapy) compared with 90% for RP and 91% for RT. Although AS resulted in fewer treatment-related complications, it led to increased clinical progression (AS 40.7%, RP 17.6%, RT 19.9%) and metastatic disease (AS 13.4%, RP 6.1%, RT 7.0%). QALYs were 10.88 for AS, 11.10 for RP, and 11.13 for RT. Total costs were A$17 912 for AS, A$15 609 for RP, and A$15 118 for RT. At a willingness to pay of A$20 000/QALY, RT had a 61.4% chance of being cost-effective compared to 38.5% for RP and 0.1% for AS.  Conclusions:   Although AS resulted in fewer and delayed treatment-related complications, it was not found to be a cost-effective strategy for favorable-risk localized prostate cancer over a lifetime horizon because of an increase in the number of patients developing metastatic disease. RT was the dominant strategy yielding higher QALYs at lower cost although differences compared with RP were small.""","""['Koen Degeling', 'Niall M Corcoran', 'Amanda Pereira-Salgado', 'Anis A Hamid', 'Shankar Siva', 'Maarten J IJzerman']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Value Health""","""['Radical prostatectomy versus deferred treatment for localised prostate cancer.', 'The cost-utility of open prostatectomy compared with active surveillance in early localised prostate cancer.', 'Active monitoring, radical prostatectomy and radical radiotherapy in PSA-detected clinically localised prostate cancer: the ProtecT three-arm RCT.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Economic evaluation of treatments for patients with localized prostate cancer in Europe: a systematic review.', 'Advantageous Detection of Significant Prostate Cancer Using a Low-Field, Office-Based MRI System.', 'The Economic Burden of Localized Prostate Cancer and Insights Derived from Cost-Effectiveness Studies of the Different Treatments.']"""

We investigated whether the quality of reporting of PRO data in cancer RCTs has improved over the last 15 years.  Methods:   We identified all cancer RCTs with PRO endpoints conducted across the most prevalent solid tumor types worldwide published between 2004 and 2019. The quality of PRO reporting was assessed using the International Society for Quality of Life Research recommended standards, which include important aspects related to assessment methodology, statistical analyses, and interpretation of data.  Results:   We assessed a total of 631 cancer RCTs in breast (n = 187), lung (n = 131), prostate (n = 120), colorectal (n = 107), and gynecological (n = 86) cancer. We observed a higher adherence to the International Society for Quality of Life Research reporting criteria in the more recently published studies. In a multivariable linear regression analysis, we observed a statistically significant improvement in the quality of PRO reporting over time (P<.001), and this relationship was independent of other measured confounding factors, such as sample size and study sponsorship. Overall, the quality of PRO reporting was higher for studies published after the publication of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-PRO Extension.  Conclusions:   The quality of PRO reporting in cancer RCTs published in the last 15 years has improved significantly.

It is estimated that the situation will be aggravated by the progressive aging of PLWH. Early diagnosis through intensive cancer screening may improve the ability for therapeutic interventions and could be critical in reducing mortality, but it might also increase expenditure and harms associated with adverse events. The aim of this study is to evaluate an enhanced screening program for early diagnosis of cancer in PLWH compared to standard practice. The specific objectives are (1) to compare the frequency of cancer diagnosed at an early stage, (2) to analyze safety of the enhanced program: adverse events and unnecessary interventions, (3) to analyze the cost-utility of the program, and (4) to estimate the overall and site-specific incidence of NADC in PLWH.  Methods:   We will conduct a multicenter, non-blinded, randomized, controlled trial, comparing two parallel arms: conventional vs enhanced screening. Data will be recorded in an electronic data collection notebook. Conventional intervention group will follow the standard of care screening in the participating centers, according to the European AIDS Clinical Society recommendations, and the enhanced intervention group will follow an expanded screening aimed to early detection of lung, liver, anal, cervical, breast, prostate, colorectal, and skin cancer. The trial will be conducted within the framework of the Spanish AIDS Research Network Cohort (CoRIS).  Discussion:   The trial will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and efficiency of an enhanced screening program for the early diagnosis of cancer in HIV patients compared to standard of care practice. The information provided will be relevant since there are currently no studies on expanded cancer screening strategies in patients with HIV, and available data estimating cost effectiveness or cost-utility of such as programs are scarce. An enhanced program for NADC screening in patients with HIV could lead to early diagnosis and improve the prognosis of these patients, with an acceptable rate of unnecessary interventions, but it is critical to demonstrate that the benefits clearly outweigh the harms, before the strategy could be implemented.

Current practice is to use standard parametric models for generating extrapolations. Several emerging, more flexible, survival models are available which can provide improved within-sample fit. This study aimed to assess if these emerging practice models also provided improved extrapolations.  Methods:   Both a simulation study and a case-study were used to assess the goodness of fit of five classes of survival model. These were: current practice models, Royston Parmar models (RPMs), Fractional polynomials (FPs), Generalised additive models (GAMs), and Dynamic survival models (DSMs). The simulation study used a mixture-Weibull model as the data-generating mechanism with varying lengths of follow-up and sample sizes. The case-study was long-term follow-up of a prostate cancer trial. For both studies, models were fit to an early data-cut of the data, and extrapolations compared to the known long-term follow-up.  Results:   The emerging practice models provided better within-sample fit than current practice models. For data-rich simulation scenarios (large sample sizes or long follow-up), the GAMs and DSMs provided improved extrapolations compared with current practice. Extrapolations from FPs were always very poor whilst those from RPMs were similar to current practice. With short follow-up all the models struggled to provide useful extrapolations. In the case-study all the models provided very similar estimates, but extrapolations were all poor as no model was able to capture a turning-point during the extrapolated period.  Conclusions:   Good within-sample fit does not guarantee good extrapolation performance. Both GAMs and DSMs may be considered as candidate extrapolation models in addition to current practice.
