This observational multicenter study aimed to assess the efficacy of upfront abiraterone acetate in Japanese patients with LATITUDE-high-risk metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer.  Methods:   The present study included 112 Japanese patients with LATITUDE-high-risk metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer who received upfront abiraterone acetate at four institutions belonging to the Tokai Urologic Oncology Research Seminar group, between January 2018 and September 2020. Progression-free survival and overall survival were assessed, and Cox regression analyses were carried out to evaluate the prognostic significance of upfront abiraterone acetate for progression-free survival.  Results:   Within a median follow-up period of 13 months, the progression-free survival and overall survival rates were 76.8% and 89.3%, respectively. Both univariate and multivariable Cox regression analyses showed that the presence of Gleason pattern 5, performance status and hemoglobin were independent predictors of progression-free survival. The patients were subsequently divided into three groups as follows: group 1, 17 patients negative for these three independent progression-free survival predictors; group 2, 49 patients with one positive independent progression-free survival predictor; and group 3, 45 patients with two or three independent progression-free survival predictors. Progression-free survival was significantly different among these three groups (P < 0.001).  Conclusion:   Upfront abiraterone acetate might provide satisfactory outcomes for Japanese patients with LATITUDE-high-risk metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer. Gleason pattern 5, performance status and hemoglobin are potential predictors of progression-free survival in Japanese patients with LATITUDE-high-risk metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer who received upfront abiraterone acetate.""","""['Kiyoshi Takahara', 'Taku Naiki', 'Toshiki Ito', 'Keita Nakane', 'Takuya Koie', 'Takahiro Yasui', 'Hideaki Miyake', 'Ryoichi Shiroki']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Urol""","""['Comparison of clinical outcomes between androgen deprivation therapy with up-front abiraterone and bicalutamide for Japanese patients with LATITUDE high-risk prostate cancer in a real-world retrospective analysis.', 'Patient-reported outcomes following abiraterone acetate plus prednisone added to androgen deprivation therapy in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic castration-naive prostate cancer (LATITUDE): an international, randomised phase 3 trial.', 'Real-world outcomes and risk stratification in patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer treated with upfront abiraterone acetate and docetaxel.', 'Abiraterone acetate to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in combination with prednisone.', 'Targeting Metastatic Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer: Chemohormonal Therapy and New Combinatorial Approaches.', 'Trends in the Use of Second-Generation Androgen Receptor Axis Inhibitors for Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer and Clinical Factors Predicting Biological Recurrence.', 'Predictive factors for the efficacy of abiraterone acetate therapy in high-risk metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer patients.', 'Humoral response after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in patients with prostate cancer using steroids.']"""

However, there is a limited appreciation of the true prevalence of low muscle mass due to inconsistent diagnostic methods and limited oncologist awareness.  Methods:   Twenty-nine French healthcare establishments participated in this cross-sectional study, recruiting patients with those metastatic cancers most frequently encountered in routine practice (colon, breast, kidney, lung, prostate). The primary outcome was low skeletal muscle mass prevalence, as diagnosed by estimating the skeletal mass index (SMI) in the middle of the third-lumbar vertebrae (L3) level via computed tomography (CT). Other objectives included an evaluation of nutritional management, physical activity, and toxicities related to ongoing treatment.  Results:   Seven hundred sixty-six patients (49.9% males) were enrolled with a mean age of 65.0 years. Low muscle mass prevalence was 69.1%. Only one-third of patients with low skeletal muscle mass were receiving nutritional counselling and only 28.4% were under nutritional management (oral supplements, enteral or parenteral nutrition). Physicians highly underdiagnosed those patients identified with low skeletal muscle mass, as defined by the primary objective, by 74.3% and 44.9% in obese and non-obese patients, respectively. Multivariate analyses revealed a lower risk of low skeletal muscle mass for females (OR: 0.22, P < 0.01) and those without brain metastasis (OR: 0.34, P < 0.01). Low skeletal muscle mass patients were more likely to have delayed treatment administration due to toxicity (11.9% versus 6.8%, P = 0.04).  Conclusions:   There is a critical need to raise awareness of low skeletal muscle mass diagnosis among oncologists, and for improvements in nutritional management and physical therapies of cancer patients to curb potential cachexia. This calls for cross-disciplinary collaborations among oncologists, nutritionists, physiotherapists, and radiologists.""","""['Bruno Raynard', 'Frederic Pigneur', 'Mario Di Palma', 'Elise Deluche', 'François Goldwasser']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['Enhancing evaluation of sarcopenia in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by assessing skeletal muscle index (SMI) at the first lumbar (L1) level on routine chest computed tomography (CT).', 'Is sarcopenia a missed factor in the management of patients with metastatic breast cancer?', 'CT-Determined Sarcopenia in GLIM-Defined Malnutrition and Prediction of 6-Month Mortality in Cancer Inpatients.', 'Chemotherapy-Induced Sarcopenia.', 'Impact of sarcopenia in the management of urological cancer patients.', '18F-FDG PET/CT imaging of several asymptomatic skeletal muscle metastases of mixed germ cell ovarian cancer.', 'Psoas muscle index is not representative of skeletal muscle index for evaluating cancer sarcopenia.', 'Prevalence and clinical implications of abnormal body composition phenotypes in patients with COVID-19: a systematic review.', 'Assessment of Functional and Nutritional Status and Skeletal Muscle Mass for the Prognosis of Critically Ill Solid Cancer Patients.', 'Muscle and Bone Defects in Metastatic Disease.']"""

However, the mechanism underlying the specific role of KDM6A/B in PCa is still fragmentary. Here, we report novel KDM6A/B downstream targets involved in controlling PCa cell proliferation. KDM6A and KDM6B mRNAs were higher in prostate adenocarcinoma, lymph node metastatic site (LNCaP) but not in prostate adenocarcinoma, bone metastatic site (PC3) and prostate adenocarcinoma, brain metastatic site (DU145) cells. Higher KDM6A mRNA was confirmed at the protein level. A metastasis associated gene focused oligonucleotide array was performed to identify KDM6A/B dependent genes in LNCaP cells treated with a KDM6 family selective inhibitor, ethyl-3-(6-(4,5-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]azepin-3(2H)-yl)-2-(pyridin-2-yl)pyrimidin-4-ylamino)propanoate (GSK-J4). This identified five genes [V-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (avian) (c-MYC), neurofibromin 2 (merlin) (NF2), C-terminal binding protein 1 (CTBP1), EPH receptor B2 (EPHB2), and plasminogen activator urokinase receptor (PLAUR)] that were decreased more than 50% by GSK-J4, and c-MYC was the most downregulated gene. Array data were validated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), which detected a reduction in c-MYC steady state mRNA and prespliced mRNA, indicative of transcriptional repression of c-MYC gene expression. Furthermore, c-MYC protein was also decreased by GSK-J4. Importantly, GSK-J4 reduced mRNA and protein levels of c-MYC target gene, cyclinD1 (CCND1). Silencing of KDM6A/B with small interfering RNA (siRNA) confirmed that expression of both c-MYC and CCND1 are dependent on KDM6B. Phosphorylated retinoblastoma (pRb), a marker of G1 to S-phase transition, was decreased by GSK-J4 and KDM6B silencing. GSK-J4 treatment resulted in a decrease in cell proliferation and cell number, detected by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS) assay and conventional cell counting, respectively. Consequently, we conclude that KDM6B controlling c-MYC, CCND1, and pRb contribute regulation of PCa cell proliferation, which represents KDM6B as a promising epigenetic target for the treatment of advanced PCa. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Lysine demethylase 6A (KDM6A) and 6B (KDM6B) were upregulated in prostate cancer (PCa). We reported novel KDM6A/B downstream targets controlling proliferation. Amongst 84 metastasis associated genes, V-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (avian) (c-MYC) was the most inhibited gene by KDM6 inhibitor, ethyl-3-(6-(4,5-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]azepin-3(2H)-yl)-2-(pyridin-2-yl)pyrimidin-4-ylamino)propanoate (GSK-J4). This was accompanied by decreased c-MYC targets, cyclinD1 (CCND1) and phosphorylated retinoblastoma (pRb), which were KDM6B dependent. GSK-J4 decreased proliferation and cell counting.

Results:   The cohort included 32 focal brachytherapy and 11 integrated boost whole-gland implants. Mean procedure time excluding dose delivery was 38 min (range: 21-83) for focal, and 56 min (range: 38-89) for whole-gland implants; stable over time. EM catheter reconstructions achieved a mean difference between computed and measured free-length of 0.8 mm (SD 0.8, no corrections performed), and mean axial manual corrections 1.3 mm (SD 0.7). EM also enabled the clinical use of a non or partially visible catheter in 21% of procedures.

Therefore, we designed a study to compare the efficiency of mpMRI-TB, dual-tracer (GRPR and PSMA) PET/CT-TB, systematic biopsy, and combined biopsy for the diagnosis of prostate cancer.  Methods:   One hundred twelve suspicious PCa patients were enrolled from September 2020 to June 2021. Patients with anyone of positive dual-tracer PET/CT or mpMRI underwent TB, and all enrolled patients underwent systematic biopsy (SB) after TB. The primary outcome was the detection rates of PCa in different biopsy strategies. Secondary outcomes were the performance of three imaging methods, omission diagnostic rates, and upgrading and downgrading of biopsy samples relative to those of prostatectomy specimens in different biopsy strategies. McNemar's tests and Bonferroni correction in multiple comparisons were used to compare the primary and secondary outcomes.

Dual-tracer PET/CT screen out patients for avoiding 52.67% (59/112) unnecessary biopsy, whereas dual-tracer PET/CT-TB plus SB achieved high detection rate (77.36%) without misdiagnosis of csPCa.  Conclusion:   Dual-tracer PET/CT might screen patients for avoiding unnecessary biopsy.

Patients and methods:   In situ hybridization for miRNA-153 and immunohistochemical staining for PTEN were applied on microarray sections of 80 PCa, with different Gleason grades, and 20 benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) cases.  Results:   We found that miRNA-153 expression was significantly higher and PTEN was significantly lower in PCa compared to BPH. In PCa, high miRNA-153 expression and loss of PTEN expression were associated significantly with higher Gleason patterns, higher Gleason scores, and higher Grade groups. The expression of miRNA-153 showed a significant inverse correlation with PTEN expression.  Conclusions:   Increased miRNA-153 expression and lost PTEN expression in PCa may provide information on their role in the progression of this cancer, suggesting that miRNA-153 could affect PTEN directly in prostatic neoplastic and hyperplastic lesions, and therefore miRNA-153 can be considered a new tool to improve the treatment efficacy and prognosis of PCa patients.""","""['T Aboushousha', 'E I El-Nahas', 'A El-Hindawi', 'D Elwi', 'H El-Ganzouri', 'O Hammam', 'M Magdy', 'N S Helal']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci""","""['PTEN loss in prostatic adenocarcinoma correlates with specific adverse histologic features (intraductal carcinoma, cribriform Gleason pattern 4 and stromogenic carcinoma).', 'Expression analysis of thrombospondin 2 in prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Hypermethylation of Cyclin D2 is associated with loss of mRNA expression and tumor development in prostate cancer.', 'Expressions of FHIT and PTEN and their significance in prostate cancer.', 'Prostate stem cell antigen mRNA expression in preoperatively negative biopsy specimens predicts subsequent cancer after transurethral resection of the prostate for benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Global Gene Expression Regulation Mediated by TGFβ Through H3K9me3 Mark.']"""

Most cancers follow a uniform trajectory characterized by upregulation of polycomb-repressive-complex-2, G2-M checkpoints, and M2 macrophage polarization. Using patient-derived xenograft models, we functionally validate our observations and add single-cell resolution. Thereby, we show that tumor progression occurs through transcriptional adaption rather than a selection of pre-existing cancer cell clusters. Moreover, we determine at the single-cell level how inhibition of EZH2 - the top upregulated gene along the trajectory - reverts tumor progression and macrophage polarization.

It is imperative to prepare future doctors to eliminate disparities. Our team of senior medical students developed a surgical clerkship module examining equity in prostate cancer. Student attitudes before and after a facilitated teaching session were assessed.  Methods:   A surgical equity pilot module was integrated into the core surgical clerkship starting in July 2020. This module was composed of (1) asynchronous preparatory material and (2) a synchronous interactive case discussion regarding disparities in prostate cancer. Discussion sessions were facilitated by upper-level medical students. Participants answered optional anonymous Likert-style and open-ended survey questions before and after the session. Pre- and post-responses were compared.  Results:   One hundred and sixteen students completed the module between July 2020 and January 2021. Pre- and post-survey response rates were 66% and 29%, respectively. At baseline, almost all students (95%) agreed knowledge of disparities would make them a better physician. However, the majority (95%) described their general knowledge of surgical disparities as ""nonexistent,"" ""poor,"" or ""average."" Most students did not have a framework for assessing causes of surgical disparities (86%) and were not aware of interventions for reducing disparities (90%). After intervention, the majority rated their knowledge of surgical disparities as ""good"" or ""excellent"" (71%; P < .001). Most students indicated they had a framework 79%; P < .001) and were aware of effective interventions (62%; P < .001).

Pathologically, HnRNPK proteins are frequently overexpressed and clinically correlated with poor prognosis in various types of human cancers and are therefore pursued as attractive therapeutic targets for select patients. However, both the transcriptional regulation and degradation of HnRNPK in prostate cancer remain poorly understood.  Methods:   qRT-PCR was used to detect the expression of HnRNPK mRNA and miRNA; Immunoblots and immunohistochemical assays were used to determine the levels of HnRNPK and other proteins. Flow cytometry was used to investigate cell cycle stage. MTS and clonogenic assays were used to investigate cell proliferation. Immunoprecipitation was used to analyse the interaction between SPOP and HnRNPK. A prostate carcinoma xenograft mouse model was used to detect the in vivo effects of HnRNPK and miRNA.  Results:   In the present study, we noted that HnRNPK emerged as an important player in the carcinogenesis process of prostate cancer. miR-206 and miR-613 suppressed HnRNPK expression by targeting its 3'-UTR in PrCa cell lines in which HnRNPK is overexpressed. To explore the potential biological function, proliferation and colony formation of PrCa cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo were also dramatically suppressed upon reintroduction of miR-206/miR-613. We have further provided evidence that Cullin 3 SPOP is a novel upstream E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that governs HnRNPK protein stability and oncogenic functions by promoting the degradation of HnRNPK in polyubiquitination-dependent proteolysis in the prostate cancer setting. Moreover, prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutants fail to interact with and promote the destruction of HnRNPK proteins.  Conclusion:   Our findings reveal new posttranscriptional and posttranslational modification mechanisms of HnRNPK regulation via miR-206/miR-613 and SPOP, respectively. More importantly, given the critical oncogenic role of HnRNPK and the high frequency of SPOP mutations in prostate cancer, our results provide a molecular rationale for the clinical investigation of novel strategies to combat prostate cancer based on SPOP genetic status.""","""['Huan-Lei Wu#', 'Sen-Mao Li#', 'Yao-Chen Huang', 'Qi-Dong Xia', 'Peng Zhou', 'Xian-Miao Li', 'Xiao Yu', 'Shao-Gang Wang', 'Zhang-Qun Ye', 'Jia Hu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Cell Int""","""['SPOP-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of PDK1 suppresses AKT kinase activity and oncogenic functions.', 'Prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutations confer resistance to BET inhibitors through stabilization of BRD4.', 'FGD5-AS1 facilitates glioblastoma progression by activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling via regulating miR-129-5p/HNRNPK axis.', 'The diverse roles of SPOP in prostate cancer and kidney cancer.', 'The emerging role of SPOP protein in tumorigenesis and cancer therapy.']"""

Autophagy can prevent anticancer drug-induced apoptosis and promote tumor resistance.

Hydrophobic doxorubicin-hydrazone-caproyl-maleimide (DOX-EMCH) and autophagy-inhibiting si-Beclin1 were simultaneously delivered via the amphiphilic peptide micelle system (Co-PMs) using poly(L-arginine)-poly(L-histidine)-DOX-EMCH as the copolymer building unit. The constructed micelle system promoted the escape of si-Beclin1 from endosomes and the release of DOX into the nucleus. The Co-PMs exhibited 2.7-fold higher cytotoxicity and proapoptotic ability in PC3 cells than DOX treatment alone, demonstrating that si-Beclin1 could inhibit the autophagic activity of prostate cancer (PCa) cells by targeting the type III PI3K pathway and enhance the sensitivity of the cells to the chemotherapeutic drug DOX. In addition, the peptide micelles successfully passively targeted DOX and si-Beclin1 to the tumor tissue. Compared with DOX or si-Beclin1 treatment alone, the Co-PMs showed a 3.4-fold greater tumor inhibitory potential in vivo, indicative of a significant antiproliferative effect.

Methods:   Levels of the AGE Nε-(carboxylethyl)lysine (CML) were quantified by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a tissue microarray which consisted of 3 cores from tumor and 2 cores from benign areas from 118 patients (87 African American and 31 European American). Ancestry informative markers for African Ancestry were available for 79 patients. Epithelial and stromal areas were quantified separately using an E-cadherin mask. CML levels were compared with clinical grade group and ancestry by mixed linear effect models. Age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, body mass index (BMI), and hemoglobin A1C were included as covariates.  Results:   CML levels were lower in areas of the tumor, for both epithelium and surrounding stroma, compared with benign, but did not significantly change with tumor grade group. Age, PSA levels, BMI, and hemoglobin A1C did not associate with CML levels. CML levels were inversely associated with the percentage of African Ancestry in all tissues.  Conclusions:   The low CML levels in cancer may reflect the reduced glycolytic state of the tissue. The inverse relationship between African Ancestry and CML levels in both benign and cancer areas suggests a state of reduced glycolysis. It is yet to be determined whether altered glycolysis and CML levels are bystanders or drivers of carcinogenesis.""","""['Morgan L Zenner', 'Yves B Helou', 'Ryan J Deaton', 'Maria Sverdlov', 'Heng Wang', 'Andre Kajdacsy-Balla', 'Virgilia Macias', 'Cindy Voisine', 'Marcus Murray', 'Sarki A Abdulkadir', 'Adam B Murphy', 'Larisa Nonn']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Accumulation of the advanced glycation end product carboxymethyl lysine in breast cancer is positively associated with estrogen receptor expression and unfavorable prognosis in estrogen receptor-negative cases.', 'Hepatic Fat Content and Liver Enzymes Are Associated with Circulating Free and Protein-Bound Advanced Glycation End Products, Which Are Associated with Low-Grade Inflammation: The CODAM Study.', 'Race, genetic West African ancestry, and prostate cancer prediction by prostate-specific antigen in prospectively screened high-risk men.', 'Comparative analysis of p16 expression among African American and European American prostate cancer patients.', 'Review of the characteristics of food-derived and endogenous ne-carboxymethyllysine.', 'Advanced glycation end products promote the progression of chronic kidney diseases by targeting calpain 6.']"""

Methods:   We reviewed the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC) registry for men with GG1 PC undergoing RP from April 2012 to July 2018. Men were classified into groups based on time from diagnosis to RP: immediate (surgery within 1 year of diagnosis) and delayed RP (surgery >1 year after initiation of AS). Time to secondary treatment was estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves and compared using the log-rank test. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was fit to assess the association between timing of RP and use of secondary treatments. A chi-squared test was used to assess the association between delayed RP and adverse pathology.  Results:   We identified 1878 men that underwent an RP during the study period, of which 1489 (79%) underwent immediate RP and 389 (21%) underwent delayed RP. The incidence of adverse pathology was higher in men with delayed versus immediate RP (49% vs. 36%, p < 0.0001, respectively). However, we noted only a small absolute difference in the estimated 24-month secondary treatment-free probability between men with delayed versus immediate RP (93% and 96%, respectively). On multivariable analysis, delayed RP was associated with increased use of secondary treatments (hazard ratio = 1.94, 95% confidence interval = 1.23-3.06, p = 0.004).  Conclusions:   The use of secondary treatment after RP in men with GG1 PC undergoing immediate or delayed prostatectomy was rare. These data suggest that the burden of treatment is near equivalent in patients who progress to treatment on AS compared with those who underwent immediate RP.""","""['Rohith Arcot', 'Michael L Cher', 'Ji Qi', 'Susan M Linsell', 'Rodney L Dunn', 'Arvin K George', 'James E Montie', 'Kevin B Ginsburg;Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Immediate versus delayed radical prostatectomy: updated outcomes following active surveillance of prostate cancer.', 'Evaluating the Safety of Active Surveillance: Outcomes of Deferred Radical Prostatectomy after an Initial Period of Surveillance.', 'Immediate versus delayed prostatectomy: Nationwide population-based study (.).', 'Radical prostatectomy versus watchful waiting for prostate cancer.', 'Outcomes of Grade Group 2 and 3 Prostate Cancer on Initial Versus Confirmatory Biopsy: Implications for Active Surveillance.']"""

We employed machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict BCR after RP, and compare them with traditional regression models and nomograms.  Methods:   Utilizing a prospective Uro-oncology registry, 18 clinicopathological parameters of 1130 consecutive patients who underwent RP (2009-2018) were recorded, yielding over 20,000 data points for analysis. The data set was split into a 70:30 ratio for training and validation. Three ML models: Naïve Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) were studied, and compared with traditional regression models and nomograms (Kattan, CAPSURE, John Hopkins [JHH]) to predict BCR at 1, 3, and 5 years.  Results:   Over a median follow-up of 70.0 months, 176 (15.6%) developed BCR, at a median time of 16.0 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 11.0-26.0). Multivariate analyses demonstrated strongest association of BCR with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (p: 0.015), positive surgical margins (p < 0.001), extraprostatic extension (p: 0.002), seminal vesicle invasion (p: 0.004), and grade group (p < 0.001). The 3 ML models demonstrated good prediction of BCR at 1, 3, and 5 years, with the area under curves (AUC) of NB at 0.894, 0.876, and 0.894, RF at 0.846, 0.875, and 0.888, and SVM at 0.835, 0.850, and 0.855, respectively. All models demonstrated (1) robust accuracy (>0.82), (2) good calibration with minimal overfitting, (3) longitudinal consistency across the three time points, and (4) inter-model validity. The ML models were comparable to traditional regression analyses (AUC: 0.797, 0.848, and 0.862) and outperformed the three nomograms: Kattan (AUC: 0.815, 0.798, and 0.799), JHH (AUC: 0.820, 0.757, and 0.750) and CAPSURE nomograms (AUC: 0.706, 0.720, and 0.749) (p < 0.001).

Acknowledging how cancer disrupts everyday life, we focus on the day-to-day experiences and struggles that take place inside and outside the hospital. By building on illustrative quotes from the memoirs, we discuss different facets of cancer as a lived experience. Our findings show that men reconstruct their identity in the memoirs in response to the disruptive nature of cancer by including various identities from previous times. They describe a relationship with their cancer that is fluid and fitful and often depends on place, time and circumstances. We also found that the 'not knowing' of prostate cancer creates uncertainty, which can take different forms, transcends time and is shaped through medical technologies, continual testing and disagreeing doctors. Prostate cancer is often seen as easily treatable, but our findings call for a different way of looking at its impact. We argue that memoirs, written by men themselves, make it palpable what it means to live with cancer. As such, illness memoirs offer a way to advance our sociological understanding of cancer-as-a-lived experience.""","""['Jill van der Kamp', 'Afke Wieke Betten', 'Lotte Krabbenborg']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Sociol Health Illn""","""[""Narrative empathy and illness memoirs: Arthur Frank's At the Will of the Body and Kathlyn Conway's Ordinary Life."", 'Two Black men with prostate cancer: a narrative approach.', 'Use of unsolicited first-person written illness narratives in research: systematic review.', 'Drawing the mind: Aesthetics of representing mental illness in select graphic memoirs.', 'Temporal meaning of suffering.', ""'Out of the frying pan into the fire': a qualitative study of the impact on masculinity for men living with advanced prostate cancer."", 'Narratives about Negative Healthcare Service Experiences: Reported Events, Positioning, and Normative Discourse of an Active Client.', ""Men's perspectives of caring for a female partner with cancer: A longitudinal narrative study."", ""Yonder: Reflective writing, prostate cancer, disaster preparedness, and Dutch and Chinese women's body image.""]"""

Methods:   After verification of BMMSCs, we fixed the concentration gradient of SDF-1 for BMMSC cultivation to analyze CXCR4 expression by qRT-PCR and flow cytometric analysis. Furthermore, we developed a non-contact co-culture system and explored the participation of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis in PCa using qRT-PCR, flow cytometry, and ELISA. In addition, A green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transplanted methylnitrosourea (MNU)-induced PCa mouse model was established to investigate the CXCR4 expression in vivo.  Results:   The CXCR4 expression was up-regulated with the increase in SDF-1 concentrations, and elevated SDF-1 had a significant promoting effect on cell proliferation and migration in BMMSCs. Moreover, the CXCR4 expression of BMMSCs was significantly increased in the non-contact co-culture model with vascular endothelial cells (VECs), and analysis of this model also showed that the proliferation and migration of BMMSCs were promoted in the presence of VECs. The ELISA assay showed that the SDF-1 levels in the co-culture model at 48 h were significantly increased. Twenty of the GFP-transplanted mice were divided into a PCa group and a control group, and four GFP-transplanted mice were observed to have prostate tumorigenesis. It also showed that CXCR4 was obviously increased in the prostate tissue of PCa mice.

To date, the design principle of the reported NIR-II organic fluorophores has heavily relied on benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c']bis([1,2,5]thiadiazole) (BBTD) as a strong electron acceptor. Here, we report the rational design and synthesis of a NIR-II fluorescent molecule with the rarely used [1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-f]benzotriazole (TBZ) core to replace BBTD as the electron acceptor. Thanks to the weaker electron deficiency of the TBZ core than BBTD, the newly yielded NIR-II molecule (BTB) based nanoparticles have a higher mass extinction coefficient and quantum yield in water. In contrast, the nanoparticle suspension of its counterpart with BBTD as the core is nearly nonemissive. The NIR-II BTB nanoparticles allow video-rate fluorescence imaging for vasculature imaging in ears, hindlimbs, and the brain of the mouse. Additionally, its large absorptivity in the NIR-I region also promotes bioimaging using photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) and tomography (PAT). Upon surface conjugation with the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide, the functionalized nanoparticles ensured targeted detection of integrin-overexpressed tumors through both imaging modalities in two- and three-dimensional views. Thus, our approach to engineering acceptors of organic fluorophores offers a promising molecular design strategy to afford new NIR-II fluorophores for versatile biomedical imaging applications.""","""['Yaxi Li', 'Hongli Zhou', 'Renzhe Bi', 'Xiuting Li', 'Menglei Zha', 'Yanqing Yang', 'Jen-Shyang Ni', 'Weng Heng Liew', 'Malini Olivo', 'Kui Yao', 'Jie Liu', 'Hao Chen', 'Kai Li']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Mater Chem B""","""['NIR-II Fluorophore with Dithienylethene as an Electron Donor for Fluorescence/Photoacoustic Dual-Model Imaging and Photothermal Therapy.', 'Thienothiadiazole-Based NIR-II Dyes with D-A-D Structure for NIR-II Fluorescence Imaging Systems.', 'Synthesis, Characterization, and Biomedical Applications of a Targeted Dual-Modal Near-Infrared-II Fluorescence and Photoacoustic Imaging Nanoprobe.', 'Crucial breakthrough of second near-infrared biological window fluorophores: design and synthesis toward multimodal imaging and theranostics.', 'The Chemistry of Organic Contrast Agents in the NIR-II Window.', 'Looking deep inside tissue with photoacoustic molecular probes: a review.', 'Design and application of organic contrast agents for molecular imaging in the second near infrared (NIR-II) window.', 'Nanoparticulate Photoluminescent Probes for Bioimaging: Small Molecules and Polymers.']"""

Results:   The crude incidences of 3-year mortality and MACCEs were 19.90% vs 26.51% and 8.23% vs 8.65% in patients receiving GnRH therapies or surgical castration, respectively. After adjusting for age, cancer stage and comorbidities, despite no significant differences in MACCEs between groups there was a slight increase in the incidence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in patients receiving surgical castration compared with those receiving GnRH therapies. The mortality adjusted hazard ratios of MACCEs and AMI among patients receiving surgical castration were 1.11- and 1.8-fold higher than those receiving GnRH therapies.

While the variable growth rate of the total prostate gland is recognized, the growth rate of different prostate zones remains largely unclear. We evaluated the growth patterns of the prostate zones and identified clinical parameters contributing to the zonal growth rates.  Materials and methods:   Prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and clinical information were obtained retrospectively on 156 patients who had at least 3 prostate MRIs between 2003 and 2018. Different prostate zonal volumes were measured and analyzed. The outcome was analyzed using linear regression.  Results:   We observed that prostate growth rates vary depending on body mass index (BMI), transition zone index (TZI), the prostate zone and 5-alpha reductase inhibitor (5ARI) use. The peripheral zone volume growth rates increased with age and peaked at 60-70 years of age (p=0.047), while the transition zone volume demonstrates continuous growth without a peak through all ages. BMI and TZI are associated with the growth rate of the peripheral zone (p=0.026, p <0.001, respectively) but not the transition zone growth rate. 5ARI use is significantly associated with the reduction in the transition zone growth rate (p=0.033), not the peripheral zone. In addition, patients with TZI greater than 60% had the most significant reduction in the transition zone growth rate while taking 5ARI (p <0.001).

Our study was designed to determine the prostate cancer upgrading rate when biopsy guided by magnetic resonance imaging (MRGBx) is used before entry and during AS.  Materials and methods:   The cohort included 519 men with low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer who enrolled in prospective studies (NCT00949819 and NCT00102544) between February 2008 and February 2020.

Results:   Upgrading to ≥GG3 was found in 92 men after a median followup of 4.8 years (IQR 3.1-6.5) after confirmatory MRGBx. Upgrade-free probability after 5 years was 0.85 (95% CI 0.81-0.88).

In 63 men undergoing prostatectomy, upgrading from MRGBx was found in only 5 (8%).

Materials and methods:   Participants were prospectively enrolled in an AS study with protocol-directed followup at 10 centers in the U.S. and Canada. We evaluated time from diagnosis to biopsy grade reclassification and time to treatment. In men treated after initial surveillance, adverse pathology and recurrence were also analyzed.  Results:   At diagnosis, 154 (9%) had GG2 and 1,574 (91%) had GG1. Five-year reclassification rates were similar between GG2 and GG1 (30% vs 37%, p=0.11). However, more patients with GG2 were treated at 5 years (58% vs 34%, p <0.001) and GG at diagnosis was associated with time to treatment (HR=1.41; p=0.01). Treatment rates were similar in patients who reclassified during AS, but in patients who did not reclassify, those diagnosed with GG2 underwent definitive treatment more often than GG1 (5-year treatment rates 52% and 12%, p <0.0001). In participants who underwent radical prostatectomy after initial surveillance, the adjusted risk of adverse pathology was similar (HR=1.26; p=0.4).

IRE has the advantage of sparing extracellular matrix structures and thereby preserving the anatomical integrity of blood vessels, bile ducts, and ureters. This trait distinguishes IRE from more commonly used thermal ablation techniques like microwave- and radiofrequency ablation. Several prospective phase-1 and -2 studies demonstrated the safety and efficacy of IRE for the treatment of central liver, locally advanced pancreatic, and local prostate tumours. In addition, IRE induces a systemic immune response.

Materials and methods:   All 303 consecutive RARPs performed between March 2018 and February 2020 since the routine implementation of PreHab were included in our study. PreHab was carried out according to the availability of the 1-day programme before the planned date of surgery (two sessions per month including four patients per session). The PreHab programme was implemented in 165 patients (54.5%). The primary endpoint was continence recovery, strictly defined as no safety pad use at 1 and 6 months. Secondary endpoints were peri-operative variables (blood loss, operating time, length of stay, transfusion, complications, and readmission rates). Comparisons were made according to whether the PreHab pathway was applied or not (PreHab+ vs PreHab-) in univariable and multivariable models.  Results:   The PreHab pathway was implemented for a stable proportion of patients over time (54.5%). The two cohorts were comparable in terms of preoperative and pathological features (P > 0.05). Length of stay was significantly shorter in the PreHab+ group (1.3 vs 1.9 days; P = 0.001). There was a trend towards fewer complications in the PreHab+ group (P = 0.061). Use of the PreHab pathway was independently correlated with higher continence rates at 1 month (37% vs 60%; P < 0.001) and 6 months (67.4% vs 87.3%; P < 0.001), even after controlling for age, body mass index, prostate volume, type of apical reconstruction, nerve-sparing surgery and lymph node dissection. The main limitation of the study was the absence of randomization.  Conclusions:   Our experience demonstrates that the PreHab programme is the major predictor of improved peri-operative outcomes and continence recovery after RARP, with sustainable benefits 6 months after surgery.""","""['Razvan-George Rahota', 'Ambroise Salin', 'Jean-Romain Gautier', 'Christophe Almeras', 'Valérie Garnault', 'Christophe Tollon', 'Guillaume Loison', 'Jean-Baptiste Beauval', 'Guillaume Ploussard']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Retzius-sparing Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Leads to Durable Improvement in Urinary Function and Quality of Life Versus Standard Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Without Compromise on Oncologic Efficacy: Single-surgeon Series and Step-by-step Guide.', 'Total Anatomical Reconstruction During Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Implications on Early Recovery of Urinary Continence.', 'A Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial Examining the Impact of the Retzius-sparing Approach on Early Urinary Continence Recovery After Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'The role of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection in the management of high-risk prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Grades the Aggressiveness of Prostate Cancer.']"""

This study aims to investigate the gender differences in microbial spectrum and antibiotic susceptibility of uropathogens isolated from urolithiasis patients and provide insights for appropriate antimicrobial therapies.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively collected clinical microbiology data from urine culture in urolithiasis patients between March 2014 and December 2018 in Xiangya Hospital. Then the patients were divided into male and female groups. The microbial spectrum and frequency of susceptibility to antibiotics were compared.  Results:   A total of 359 uropathogen isolates were collected from 335 patients, including 144 males (43.0%) and 191 females (57.0%). E. coli dominated in both groups, indicating higher frequency in females (53.2%) than in males (26.6%, p < 0.001), followed by E. faecalis, with higher frequency in males (15.6%) than in females (2.9%, p < 0.001). Major Gram-negative (E. coli and K. pneumoniae) bacteria showed high sensitivity to cefoperazone/sulbactam, cefotetan, piperacillin/ tazobactam, and amikacin. In contrast, the resistance level was high to penicillin, tetracycline, and vancomycin in both groups. Gram-positive (E. faecalis and E. faecium) isolates demonstrated high sensitivity to gentamicin and vancomycin in both groups. Furthermore, uropathogens isolated from female urolithiasis patients were more susceptible to antimicrobials than males.  Conclusions:   Uropathogen microbial spectrum in female urolithiasis patients is different from males.

FAP tracer uptake has been reported in various tumor entities. The aim of this study was to compare FAP and Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression in primary prostate cancer employing histological analyses and PET imaging in two small patient collectives.  Methods:   Two independent small patient collectives were included in this study. For cohort A, data of 5 prostate cancer patients and 3 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia were included. Patients with prostate cancer were initially referred for PSMA PET staging. Radical prostatectomy was performed in all patients and prostate specimen of patients and biopsies of healthy controls were available for further evaluation. Histological workup included HE and immunohistochemistry using PSMA Ab, FAP Ab. Cohort B consists of 6 Patients with diagnosed mCRPC and available PSMA as well as FAP PET.  Results:   Patients with proven prostate cancer infiltration exhibited strong positivity for PSMA in both primary tumors and lymph node metastases while stainings for FAP were found positive in some cases, but not all (2/5). Controls with BPH presented moderate PSMA staining and in one case also with a positive FAP staining (1/3). PET imaging with FAP seemed to result in more precise results in case of low PSMA expression than PSMA-PET.  Conclusions:   While PSMA staining intensity is a valid indicator of prostate cancer in both primary tumor and lymph node metastases, the expression of FAP seems to be heterogeneous but not necessarily linked to cancer-associated fibroblasts. It is also present in inflammation-associated myofibroblasts. Therefore, its ultimate role in prostate cancer diagnosis remains a subject of discussion.""","""['Katharina Kessel', 'Robert Seifert', 'Matthias Weckesser', 'Martin Boegemann', 'Sebastian Huss', 'Clemens Kratochwil', 'Uwe Haberkorn', 'Frederik Giesel', 'Kambiz Rahbar']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Ann Nucl Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'How accurate is 68Gallium-prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography / computed tomography (68Ga-PSMA PET/CT) on primary lymph node staging before radical prostatectomy in intermediate and high risk prostate cancer?

Here, we have characterized and investigated the effects of TRPM8 modulators in prostate cancer aggressiveness disclosing the molecular mechanism underlying their biological activity. Patch-clamp and calcium fluorometric assays were used to characterize the synthesized compounds. Androgen-stimulated prostate cancer-derived cells were challenged with the compounds and the DNA synthesis was investigated in a preliminary screening. The most effective compounds were then employed to inhibit the pro-metastatic behavior of in various PC-derived cells, at different degree of malignancy. The effect of the compounds was then assayed in prostate cancer cell-derived 3D model and the molecular targets of selected compounds were lastly identified using transcriptional and non-transcriptional reporter assays. TRPM8 antagonists inhibit the androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasiveness. They are highly effective in reverting the androgen-induced increase in prostate cancer cell spheroid size. The compounds also revert the proliferation of castrate-resistant prostate cancer cells, provided they express the androgen receptor. In contrast, no effects were recorded in prostate cancer cells devoid of the receptor. Selected antagonists interfere in non-genomic androgen action and abolish the androgen-induced androgen receptor/TRPM8 complex assembly as well as the increase in intracellular calcium levels in prostate cancer cells.

The microscopic architecture of the prostate glands forms the basis for prognostic grading by pathologists. Interpretation of these convoluted three-dimensional (3D) glandular structures via visual inspection of a limited number of two-dimensional (2D) histology sections is often unreliable, which contributes to the under- and overtreatment of patients. To improve risk assessment and treatment decisions, we have developed a workflow for nondestructive 3D pathology and computational analysis of whole prostate biopsies labeled with a rapid and inexpensive fluorescent analogue of standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. This analysis is based on interpretable glandular features and is facilitated by the development of image translation-assisted segmentation in 3D (ITAS3D). ITAS3D is a generalizable deep learning-based strategy that enables tissue microstructures to be volumetrically segmented in an annotation-free and objective (biomarker-based) manner without requiring immunolabeling. As a preliminary demonstration of the translational value of a computational 3D versus a computational 2D pathology approach, we imaged 300 ex vivo biopsies extracted from 50 archived radical prostatectomy specimens, of which, 118 biopsies contained cancer. The 3D glandular features in cancer biopsies were superior to corresponding 2D features for risk stratification of patients with low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer based on their clinical biochemical recurrence outcomes. The results of this study support the use of computational 3D pathology for guiding the clinical management of prostate cancer.

Methods:   We conducted a cross-sectional population-based study of 23,555 Black men and 146,889 NHW men diagnosed with prostate cancer in the California Cancer Registry from 2004 to 2017.

Results:   High PSA (>20 ng/mL), GS, stage, individually and combined prostate cancer risk profiles were more common among Black men versus NHW men. In fully adjusted models, relative to NHW men, we observed a persistent 67% increased odds of high PSA among Black men. nSES was the factor most strongly associated with racial disparity in high PSA, accounting for 25% of the difference. Marital status was the factor that was second most associated with a racial disparity.

This study aimed to explore the role of hsa_circ_0030586 in PCa. Gene Expression Omnibus database (GSE77661) was used to screen out candidate circRNAs. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to verify the relative expressions of circRNAs, miRNAs, and genes in PCa cells. A CCK-8 assay was used to evaluate the cells' proliferation. Transwell and wound healing assay were used to determine the cells' migration and invasion. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the protein expression of PI3K/AKT signaling proteins and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. Furthermore, a nude mice tumorigenesis experiment in vivo was conducted to determine the function of hsa_circ_0030586 on PCa. Our results showed that hsa_circ_0030586 is significantly upregulated in PCa cells (p < 0.05). Its circular structure was confirmed via agarose gel electrophoresis and Sanger sequencing. Interfering with hsa_circ_0030586 in PC3 cells inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and led to the significant upregulation of E-cadherin and the significant downregulation of p-AKT/AKT, IKKα, PIK3CB, and Twist (all p < 0.05). Conversely, the hsa_circ_003058 interference fragment combined with the transfection of a miR-145-3p inhibitor could reverse the above effects. In vivo tumorigenesis of the xenograft model confirmed that interfering with hsa_circ_0030586 suppressed tumor cell proliferation and inhibited PI3K-AKT signaling and EMT in PC3 cells. Hsa_circ_0030586 is significantly upregulated in PCa cells and may promote EMT via PI3K-AKT signaling.""","""['Guang-Cheng Luo', 'Lin Chen', 'Jiang Fang', 'Zhi-Jian Yan']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Bioengineered""","""['Up-regulated circular RNA hsa_circ_0067934 contributes to glioblastoma progression through activating PI3K-AKT pathway.', 'The effect of low molecular weight-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons responsive hsa_circ_0039929/hsa-miR-15b-3p_R-1/FGF2 circuit on inflammatory response of A549 cells via the PI3K/AKT pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition process.', 'Screening and identification of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-related circRNA and miRNA in prostate cancer.', 'Crosstalk between circRNAs and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in cancer progression.', 'The roles and mechanisms of circular RNAs related to mTOR in cancers.', 'circSPECC1 Promotes Proliferation and Migration of LNCaP Prostate Cancer Cells by Affecting Their Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition.', 'The function and mechanisms of action of circular RNAs in Urologic Cancer.', 'The Circular RNA Circ_0085494 Regulates Prostate Cancer Progression Through NRBP1/miR-497-5p Axis.', 'Targeting PI3K/Akt signaling in prostate cancer therapy.', 'Identification of a dysregulated CircRNA-associated gene signature for predicting prognosis, immune landscape, and drug candidates in bladder cancer.']"""

Understanding variations at the patient and surgeon level may inform collaborative quality improvement.  Objective:   To describe patient- and surgeon-level sexual function outcomes for patients undergoing radical prostatectomy in the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC) and to examine the correlation between surgeon case volume and sexual function outcomes.  Design, setting, and participants:   This is a prospective cohort study using the MUSIC registry and patient-reported sexual function outcome data. Patient- and surgeon-level variation in sexual function outcomes were examined among patients undergoing radical prostatectomy from May 2014 to August 2019. Sexual function outcome data were collected using validated questionnaires, which were completed before surgery and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months' follow-up following surgery. All participants were male. Race and ethnicity data were self-reported and were included to examine potential variation in outcomes by race and/or ethnicity. Data were analyzed from January 2021 to March 2021.  Main outcomes and measures:   There were 4 outcomes in this study, including the 26-item Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26) sexual function scores at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months' follow-up; patient-level sexual function recovery at 12- and 24-month follow-up; surgeon-level variation in sexual function outcomes at 12- and 24-month follow-up; and correlation between surgeon case volume and sexual function outcomes.  Results:   A total of 1426 male patients met inclusion criteria for this study. The median (IQR) age was 64 (58-68) years. A total of 115 participants (8%) were Black, 1197 (84%) were White, 25 (2%) were of another race or ethnicity (consolidated owing to low numbers), and 89 (6%) were of unknown race or ethnicity. Among patients undergoing bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy, mean (SD) EPIC-26 sexual function scores at 12- and 24-month follow-up (12 months, 39 [28]; 24 months, 63 [29]) did not return to baseline levels. There was wide variation in EPIC-26 sexual function scores at both 12-month follow-up (range, 23-69; P < .001) and 24-month follow-up (range, 27-64; P < .001). Similar variations were found in EPIC-26 sexual function scores and recovery of sexual function by surgeon. Recovery rates ranged from 0% to 40% of patients at 12-month follow-up (18 surgeons; P < .001) and 3% to 44% of patients at 24-month follow-up (12 surgeons; P < .001). Surgeon case volume and sexual function outcomes were not significantly correlated. On multivariable analysis, the following variables were associated with better recovery at 24-month follow-up: younger age (P < .001), lower baseline EPIC-26 sexual function score (P < .001), lower Gleason score (P = .05), and nonobesity (P = .03).  Conclusions and relevance:   In this study, there was significant patient- and surgeon-level variation in sexual function recovery over 2 years following radical prostatectomy.

To explore the effect of ring A/B modifications of physachenolide C (1) on these biological activities, 23 of its natural and semisynthetic analogues were evaluated. Analogues 4-23 were prepared by chemical transformations of a readily accessible compound, physachenolide D (2). Compound 1 and its analogues 2-23 were evaluated for their antiproliferative activity against PC (LNCaP and 22Rv1), RC (ACHN), and melanoma (M14 and SK-MEL-28) cell lines and normal human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells. Most of the active analogues had selective and potent activity in reducing cell number for PC cell lines, some showing selectivity for androgen-independent and enzalutamide-resistant 22Rv1 cells compared to androgen-dependent LNCaP cells. Analogues with IC50s below 5.0 μM against ACHN cells, when tested in the presence of TRAIL, showed a significantly increased ability to reduce cell number, and those analogues active against the M14 and SK-MEL-28 cell lines exhibited enhanced activity when combined with poly I:C. These data provide additional structure-activity relationship information for 17β-hydroxywithanolides and suggest that selective activities of some analogues may be exploited to develop natural products-based tumor-specific agents for cancer chemotherapy.""","""['E M Kithsiri Wijeratne', 'Ya-Ming Xu', 'Manping X Liu', 'Marielle C Inacio', 'Alan D Brooks', 'Poonam Tewary', 'Thomas J Sayers', 'A A Leslie Gunatilaka']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Nat Prod""","""['Production and Structural Diversification of Withanolides by Aeroponic Cultivation of Plants of Solanaceae: Cytotoxic and Other Withanolides from Aeroponically Grown Physalis coztomatl.', 'Withanolides from Aeroponically Grown Physalis peruviana and Their Selective Cytotoxicity to Prostate Cancer and Renal Carcinoma Cells.', 'Small-Molecule Natural Product Physachenolide C Potentiates Immunotherapy Efficacy by Targeting BET Proteins.', 'Discovery of Potent 17β-Hydroxywithanolides for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer by High-Throughput Screening of a Natural Products Library for Androgen-Induced Gene Expression Inhibitors.', '17β-Hydroxy-18-acetoxywithanolides from Aeroponically Grown Physalis crassifolia and Their Potent and Selective Cytotoxicity for Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Curcumin Sensitises Cancerous Kidney Cells to TRAIL Induced Apoptosis via Let-7C Mediated Deregulation of Cell Cycle Proteins and Cellular Metabolism.', 'Production and Structural Diversification of Withanolides by Aeroponic Cultivation of Plants of Solanaceae: Cytotoxic and Other Withanolides from Aeroponically Grown Physalis coztomatl.']"""

Patients with negative (n = 25) and positive (n = 125) mpMRI, stratified according to the presence of prevalent cribriform pattern (PCP, ≥ 50%) and non-PCP (< 50%) at specimen, were included. Difference between the two groups were evaluated. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of PCP among mpMRI parameters. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate the area under the curve (AUC) of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and ADC ratio in detecting lesions harboring PCP.  Results:   Considering 135 positive lesions at the mpMRI, 30 (22.2%) and 105 (77.8%) harbored PCP and non-PCP PCa. The PCP lesions had more frequently nodular morphology (83.3% vs 62.9%; p = 0.04) and significantly lower mean ADC value (0.87 ± 0.16 vs 0.95 ± 0.18; p = 0.03) and ADC ratio (0.52 ± 0.09 vs 0.60 ± 0.14; p = 0.003) when compared with non-PCP lesions. At univariate and multivariate analyses, mean ADC and ADC ratio resulted as independent predictors of the presence of the PCP of the PZ tumors(OR: 0.025; p = 0.03 and OR: 0.001; p = 0.004, respectively). At the ROC analysis, the AUC of mean ADC and ADC ratio to predict the presence of PCP in patients with PZ suspicious lesion at the mpMRI were 0.69 (95% CI 0.56-0.81P, p = 0.003) and 0.72 (95% CI 0.62-0.82P, p = 0.001), respectively.

We confirmed the associations in both TCGA (P = 2.42E-24) and GTEX prostate cohorts (P = 9.08E-78). To functionally characterize this SNP, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation qPCR and confirmed stronger CTCF and PLAGL2 binding in rs7247241 C than T allele. We found that CTCF binding enrichment was negatively associated with methylation level at the SNP site in human cell lines (r = -0.58). Bisulfite sequencing showed consistent association of rs7247241-T allele with nearby sequence CpG hypermethylation in prostate cell lines and tissues. Moreover, the methylation level at CpG sites nearest to the CTCF binding and first exon splice-in (ψ) of PPP1R14A was significantly associated with aggressive phenotype in the TCGA PrCa cohort. Meanwhile, the long isoform of the gene also promoted cell proliferation.

Metastasis shows poor survival even though the recovery rate is high. In spite of numerous studies regarding prostate carcinoma, multiple questions are still unanswered. In this regards, gene regulatory network can uncover the mechanisms behind cancer progression, and metastasis. Under a feed forward loop, transcription factors (TFs) can be a good druggable candidate. We have proposed a computational model to study the uncertainty of TFs and suggest the appropriate cellular conditions for drug targeting. We have selected feed-forward loops depending on the shared list of the functional annotations among TFs, genes and miRNAs. From the potential feed forward loop cores, six TFs were identified as druggable targets, which include AR, CEBPB, CREB1, ETS1, NFKB1 and RELA. However, TFs are known for their Protein Moonlighting properties, which provide unrelated multi-functionalities within the same or different subcellular localizations. Following that, we have identified such functions that are suitable for drug targeting. On the other hand, we have tried to identify membraneless organelles for providing more specificity to the proposed time and space theory.

However, these small molecular probes have some inherent limitations, including high nephrotoxicity and short circulation time, which limits their utility in biological systems.  Methods and results:   In this study, organic melanin nanoparticles were used to directly label the long half-life radionuclide 124I (t1/2=100.8 h), and PSMA small molecular groups were efficiently bonded on the surface of nanoparticles to construct the PSMA-targeted long-retention nanoprobe 124I-PPMN, which has the potential to increase tumor uptake and prolong residence time. The results showed that the nanoprobe could substantially aggregate in the tumors of prostate cancer xenograft mice and was visible for more than 72 h. Positron Emission Computed Tomography (PET) imaging showed that the nanoprobe could be used for precise imaging of prostate cancer with high expression of PSMA. In addition, organic melanin nanoparticles labeled with an elemental radionuclide achieved a stable, metal-free structure. Cell experiments and mouse toxicity experiments indicated that the nanoprobe has high safety.  Conclusion:   The new nanoprobe constructed in this study has high specificity and biocompatibility.

Approximately 30-40% of patients with ASAP have biopsy detectable prostate cancer (PCa) within 5 years. Current guidelines recommend a repeat biopsy within 3-6 months after the initial diagnosis. The aim of the present study was to examine the association between ASAP and subsequent diagnosis of clinically significant PCa (csPCa). The need for immediate repeat biopsy was also evaluated. We identified 212 patients with an ASAP diagnosis on their first biopsy at our institution between February 2006 and March 2018. Of these patients, 102 (48.1%) had at least one follow-up biopsy. Clinicopathologic features including rates of subsequent PCa and csPCa were assessed. Thirty-five patients subsequently underwent radical prostatectomy (RP). Their pathologic results were reviewed. csPCa was defined as the presence of Gleason score (GS) ≥ 3 + 4 in ≥ 1 biopsy core. Adverse pathology (AP) was defined as high-grade (primary Gleason pattern ≥ 4) or non-organ-confined disease (pT3/N1) after RP. Of 102 patients, 87 (85.3%), 13 (12.7%), and 2 (2.0%) had one, two, and three follow-up biopsies, respectively. Median time from the initial ASAP diagnosis to the 2nd follow-up biopsy and the last follow-up biopsy were 21.9 months (range 1-129 months) and 27.7 months (range 1-129 months), respectively. Of these patients, 46 (45.1%) were subsequently diagnosed with PCa, including 20 (19.6%) with csPCa. Only 2 (2.0%) patients had GS ≥ 8 disease. Five (4.9%) patients had number of positive cores > 3. Of 35 patients who subsequently underwent RP, seven (20%) had AP after RP and 17 (48.6%) showed GS upgrading. Of these 17 patients, the vast majority (16/17, 94.1%) had GS upgrading from 3 + 3 to 3 + 4. 45.1% of patients with an initial diagnosis of ASAP who had repeat prostate biopsy were subsequently diagnosed with PCa and 19.6% were found to have csPCa.

Bone health agents (BHA, ie bisphosphonates and denosumab) and new life-prolonging drugs (LPDs) can delay SSEs. The aim of this study is to investigate the use of BHAs in relation to SSEs in treated real-world mCRPC population.  Patients and methods:   We included patients from the CAPRI registry who were treated with at least one LPD and diagnosed with bone metastases prior to the start of first LPD (LPD1). Outcomes were SSEs (external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to the bone, orthopedic surgery, pathologic fracture or spinal cord compression) and SSE-free survival (SSE-FS) since LPD1.  Results:   One-thousand nine hundred and twenty-three patients were included with a median follow-up from LPD1 of 16.7 months. Fifty-two percent (n = 996) started BHA prior or within 4 weeks after the start of LPD1 (early BHA). In total, 41% experienced at least one SSE. SSE incidence rate was 0.29 per patient year for patients without BHA and 0.27 for patients with early BHA. Median SSE-FS from LPD1 was 12.9 months. SSE-FS was longer in patients who started BHA early versus patients without BHA (13.2 vs. 11.0 months, P = .001).  Conclusion:   In a real-world population we observed an undertreatment with BHAs, although patients with early BHA use had lower incidence rates of SSEs and longer SSE-FS.

Materials and methods:   All patients treated with LDR brachytherapy for prostate cancer at a single UK centre between 2001 and November 2020 (n = 1142) were eligible; 632 patients met the inclusion criteria for the analysis. The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS), defined as freedom from clinical, radiological or PSA progression requiring androgen deprivation therapy. Four-year PSA was categorised as ≤0.2, >0.2 to ≤0.5, >0.5 to ≤1.0 and >1.0 ng/ml. Kaplan-Meier analysis to 15 years was undertaken for each group, and sensitivity and specificity of 4-year PSA as a surrogate for long-term cure were calculated. Kaplan-Meier analysis to 15 years was repeated, stratifying patients by NCCN risk groups.  Results:   The median cohort age was 63 years; the median follow-up was 9.1 years (range 3.5-18.7).

Multi-action mechanism and strong influence of the cyclometallating ligand""","""Photodynamic therapy is an alternative to classical chemotherapy due to its potential to reduce side effects by a controlled activation of a photosensitizer through local irradiation with light. The photosensitizer then interacts with oxygen and generates reactive oxygen species. Iridium biscyclometallated complexes are very promising photosensitizers due to their exceptional photophysical properties and their ability to target mitochondria. Four Ir(III) biscyclometallated complexes of formula [Ir(C^N)2(N^N')]Cl, where N^N' is a ligand containing a benzimidazolyl fragment, have been synthesized and characterized. The C^N ligands were 2-phenylpyridinate (ppy) and 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridinate (dfppy). The complexes exhibited high photostability. The electrochemical and photophysical properties were modulated by both the cyclometallating and the ancillary ligands. The dfppy derivatives yielded the highest emission energy values, quantum yields of phosphorescence and excited state lifetimes. All complexes generated 1O2 in aerated solutions upon irradiation. Biological studies revealed that these complexes have a moderate cytotoxicity in the dark against different human cancer cell lines: prostate (PC-3), colon (CACO-2) and melanoma (SK-MEL-28), and against non-malignant fibroblasts (CCD-18Co). However, derivatives with ppy ligands ([1a]Cl, [2a]Cl) yielded a relevant photodynamic activity upon light irradiation (450 nm, 24.1 J cm-2), with phototoxicity indexes (EC50,dark/EC50,light) of 20.8 and 17.3, respectively, achieved in PC-3 cells. Mechanistic studies showed that these complexes are taken up by the cells through endocytosis and preferentially accumulate in mitochondria.

A total of 89 patients with prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia diagnosed by MRI examination and pathological examination in hospital were selected as the research objects in this study (they passed the exclusion criteria). The MRI images of these patients were collected in two groups and divided into two groups before and after treatment according to whether the CNN algorithm was used to process them. The number of diagnosed diseases and the number of cases of risk level inferred based on the tumor grading were compared to observe which group was closer to the diagnosis of pathological biopsy. Through comparative analysis, compared with the positive rate of pathological diagnosis (44%), the positive rate after the treatment of the CNN algorithm (42%) was more similar to that before the treatment (34%), and the comparison was statistically marked (P < 0.05). In terms of risk stratification, the grading results after treatment (37 cases) were closer to the results of pathological grading (39 cases) than those before treatment (30 cases), and the comparison was statistically obvious (P < 0.05). In addition, it was obvious that the MRT images would be clearer after treatment through the observation of the MRT images before and after treatment. In conclusion, MRI image segmentation algorithm based on CNN was more accurate in the diagnosis and risk stratification of prostate cancer than routine MRI. According to the evaluation of Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff I distance (HD), the CNN segmentation method used in this study was more perfect than other segmentation methods.""","""['Weijun Gao', 'Peibo Zhang', 'Hui Wang', 'Pengfei Tuo', 'Zhiqing Li']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Healthc Eng""","""['The Value of Convolutional Neural Network-Based Magnetic Resonance Imaging Image Segmentation Algorithm to Guide Targeted Controlled Release of Doxorubicin Nanopreparation.', 'Combined Transfer Learning and Test-Time Augmentation Improves Convolutional Neural Network-Based Semantic Segmentation of Prostate Cancer from Multi-Parametric MR Images.', 'Diagnosis and Treatment Effect of Convolutional Neural Network-Based Magnetic Resonance Image Features on Severe Stroke and Mental State.', 'Automatic segmentation of prostate MRI using convolutional neural networks: Investigating the impact of network architecture on the accuracy of volume measurement and MRI-ultrasound registration.', 'Convolutional neural network-based approach for segmentation of left ventricle myocardial scar from 3D late gadolinium enhancement MR images.']"""

This study investigates the influence of a transactional decision aid (DA) or cost compensation (CC) for a PSA test on the decisional behaviour of men. Prospective, cluster-randomised trial to compare two interventions in a 2 × 2 factorial design: DA versus counselling as usual, and CC versus noCC for PSA-testing. 90 cluster-randomised physicians in the administrative district of Muenster, Germany recruited 962 participants aged 55-69 yrs. in 2018. Primary endpoint: the influence of the DA and CC on the decisional conflict. Secondary endpoints: factors which altered the involvement of the men regarding their decision to take a PSA-test. The primary endpoint was analysed by a multivariate regression model. The choice to take the PSA test was increased by CC and reduced by the DA, the latter also reduced PSA uptake in men who were offered CC. The DA led to an increase of the median knowledge about early detection, changed willingness to perform a PSA test without increasing the level of shared decision, giving participants a stronger feeling of having made the decision by themselves. The DA did not alter the decisional conflict, as it was very low in all study groups. DA reduced and CC increased the PSA uptake. The DA seemed to have a greater impact on the participants than CC, as it led to fewer PSA tests even if CC was granted.Trial registration: German Clinical Trial Register (Deutsches Register Klinischer Studien DRKS00007687).

The optimized Cancer-on-Chip (CoC) platform maintained viability and sustained proliferation of breast and prostate tumor slices for 7 days. No major changes in tissue morphology or gene expression patterns were observed within this time frame, suggesting that the CoC system provides a reliable and effective way to probe intrinsic chemotherapeutic sensitivity of tumors. The customized CoC platform accurately predicted cisplatin and apalutamide treatment response in breast and prostate tumor xenograft models, respectively. The culture period for breast cancer could be extended up to 14 days without major changes in tissue morphology and viability. These culture characteristics enable assessment of treatment outcomes and open possibilities for detailed mechanistic studies.

The development of risk-adjusted therapies is an unmet need for these patients.  Objective:   To describe our novel technique of precision prostatectomy, a form of surgical focal therapy that allows radical excision of the index PCa lesion along with >90% prostatic tissue extirpation while preserving the prostatic capsule and seminal vesicle/vas deferens complex on the side contralateral to the dominant cancer lesion, and to report on medium-term functional and oncologic outcomes in the first 88 consecutive men who underwent this procedure between December 2016 and January 2020.  Design, setting, and participants:   Men with (1) prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤20 ng/ml, (2) clinical T stage ≤cT2, (3) a dominant unilateral lesion with Gleason ≤ 4 + 3 disease with any number or percentage of cores involved ipsilaterally on prostate biopsy, (4) no primary Gleason ≥4 lesion contralaterally, and (5) a preoperative Sexual Health Inventory of Men (SHIM) score of ≥17 (out of 25) with/without phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor use who consented to undergo precision prostatectomy were included in this single-arm, single-center, IDEAL stage 2b prospective development study.  Intervention:   Robotic precision prostatectomy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The safety and urinary, sexual, and oncologic outcomes of the precision prostatectomy technique were studied. Descriptive statistics and Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to assess 12-mo urinary continence (0-1 pad), 12-mo sexual potency (SHIM score ≥17), 36-mo freedom from clinically significant PCa (grade group ≥2), secondary treatments, metastatic disease, and mortality.  Results and limitations:   At study entry, the median age, PSA, and SHIM score were 60.0 yr (interquartile range [IQR] 54.2-65.9), 5.7 ng/ml (IQR 4.2-7.1), and 22 points (IQR 19-24), respectively. The median follow-up was 25 mo (IQR 14-38). At 12 mo, all patients were continent (0-1 pads), with 90.9% of patients using 0 pads. The median time to urinary continence was 1 mo (IQR 1-4). At 12 mo, 85% of all-comers and 90.2% of the preoperatively potent men were potent. The median time to sexual potency was 4 mo (IQR 4-12). From an oncologic standpoint, at 36 mo an estimated 93.4% of the patients were free from clinically significant residual PCa and 91.7% had not undergone any additional treatment. All patients were alive and free of metastatic disease at 36 mo.  Conclusions:   Precision prostatectomy is technically safe and reproducible and offers excellent postoperative functional results. At 36-mo follow-up, the oncologic outcomes and secondary treatment rates appear to be superior to existing ablative focal therapy results. Pending long-term data, a risk-stratified surgical approach to PCa may avoid whole-gland therapy and preserve functional quality of life in men with localized PCa.  Patient summary:   Precision prostatectomy is a new form of focal therapy for intermediate-risk prostate cancer in which a 5-10-mm rim of prostate capsule is left on the opposite side of the gland to where the dominant cancer is located. The technique appears to be safe and efficacious and adds to the growing armamentarium of risk-adapted therapies for treatment of localized prostate cancer that avoid the adverse effects on urinary and erectile function of whole-gland treatments.""","""['Akshay Sood', 'Wooju Jeong', 'Isaac Palma-Zamora', 'Firas Abdollah', 'Mohit Butaney', 'Nicholas Corsi', 'Hallie Wurst', 'Sohrab Arora', 'Naveen Kachroo', 'Oudai Hassan', 'Nilesh Gupta', 'Michael A Gorin', 'Mani Menon']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Urological Oncology: Prostate Cancer.', 'Laparoscopy/New Technology.', 'The Precision Prostatectomy: an IDEAL Stage 0, 1 and 2a Study.', 'Subtotal surgical therapy for localized prostate cancer: a single-center precision prostatectomy experience in 25 patients, and SEER-registry data analysis.', 'Retzius-sparing Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Leads to Durable Improvement in Urinary Function and Quality of Life Versus Standard Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Without Compromise on Oncologic Efficacy: Single-surgeon Series and Step-by-step Guide.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'The role of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection in the management of high-risk prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Ultrapreservation in Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy Provides Early Continence Recovery.', 'Incorporating VR-RENDER Fusion Software in Robot-Assisted Partial Prostatectomy: The First Case Report.', 'Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: Advancements in surgical technique and perioperative care.', 'Impact of prostate biopsy technique on outcomes of the precision prostatectomy procedure.']"""

Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccine presents an attractive approach to achieve satisfactory outcomes; however, tumor antigen screening and vaccination candidates show a bottleneck in this field. We aimed to investigate the tumor antigens for mRNA vaccine development and immune subtypes for choosing appropriate patients for vaccination. We identified eight overexpressed and mutated tumor antigens with poor prognostic value of PRAD, including KLHL17, CPT1B, IQGAP3, LIME1, YJEFN3, KIAA1529, MSH5 and CELSR3. The correlation of those genes with antigen-presenting immune cells were assessed. We further identified three immune subtypes of PRAD (PRAD immune subtype [PIS] 1-3) with distinct clinical, molecular, and cellular characteristics. PIS1 showed better survival and immune cell infiltration, nevertheless, PIS2 and PIS3 showed cold tumor features with poorer prognosis and higher tumor genomic instability. Moreover, these immune subtypes presented distinguished association with immune checkpoints, immunogenic cell death modulators, and prognostic factors of PRAD. Furthermore, immune landscape characterization unraveled the immune heterogeneity among patients with PRAD. To summarize, our study suggests KLHL17, CPT1B, IQGAP3, LIME1, YJEFN3, KIAA1529, MSH5 and CELSR3 are potential antigens for PRAD mRNA vaccine development, and patients in the PIS2 and PIS3 groups are more suitable for vaccination.""","""['Xiaonan Zheng#', 'Hang Xu#', 'Xianyanling Yi#', 'Tianyi Zhang', 'Qiang Wei', 'Hong Li', 'Jianzhong Ai']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Identification of tumor antigens and immune subtypes of pancreatic adenocarcinoma for mRNA vaccine development.', 'Recognition of Tumor-Associated Antigens and Immune Subtypes in Glioma for mRNA Vaccine Development.', 'Identification of tumor antigens and immune subtypes of cholangiocarcinoma for mRNA vaccine development.', 'Prospects and limitations of recombinant poxviruses for prostate cancer immunotherapy.', 'Active immunotherapy of prostate cancer with a focus on dendritic cells.', 'Rethinking Antigen Source: Cancer Vaccines Based on Whole Tumor Cell/tissue Lysate or Whole Tumor Cell.', 'The Antithetic Roles of IQGAP2 and IQGAP3 in Cancers.', 'RNA modification in mRNA cancer vaccines.', 'Machine learning and experimental validation to construct a metastasis-related gene signature and ceRNA network for predicting osteosarcoma prognosis.', 'Identification of tumor antigens and immune subtypes in lung squamous cell carcinoma for mRNA vaccine development.']"""

In this work we investigate the urologist's learning curve of in-bore MRI-guided prostate biopsy which is considered to be a superior biopsy technique.  Materials and methods:   Following Helsinki approval by The Chaim Sheba Medical Center ethics committee in accordance with The Sheba Medical Center institutional guidelines (5366-28-SMC) we retrospectively reviewed 110 IB-MRGpBs performed from 6/2016 to 1/2019 in a single tertiary center. All patients had a prostate multi-parametric MRI finding of at least 1 target lesion (prostate imaging reporting and data system [PI-RADS] score ≥ 3). We analyzed biopsy duration and clinically significant prostate cancer detection of targeted sampling in 2 groups of 55 patients each, once by a urologist highly trained in IB-MRGpBs and again by a urologist untrained in IB-MRGpBs. These two parameters were compared according to operating urologist and chronologic order.  Results:   The patients' median age was 68 years (interquartile range 62-72). The mean prostate-specific antigen level and prostate size were 8.6 ± 9.1 ng/d and 53 ± 27 cc, respectively. The mean number of target lesions was 1.47 ± 0.6. Baseline parameters did not differ significantly between the 2 urologists' cohorts. Overall detection rates of clinically significant prostate cancer were 19%, 55%, and 69% for PI-RADS 3, 4 and 5, respectively. Clinically significant cancer detection rates did not differ significantly along the timeline or between the 2 urologists. The average duration of IB-MRGpB targeted sampling was 28 ± 15.8 min, correlating with the number of target lesions (p < 0.0001), and independent of the urologist's expertise. Eighteen cases defined the cutoff for the procedure duration learning curve (p < 0.05).

First RT course was delivered with 3D conformal RT techniques, SBRT or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). All patients underwent re-irradiation with SBRT with heavy hypofractionated schedules. Cumulative dose-volume values to organs at risk (OARs) were computed and possible correlation with developed toxicities was investigated.  Results:   Twenty-six patients were included. Median age at re-irradiation was 75 years, mean interval between the two RT courses was 5.6 years and the median follow-up was 47.7 months (13.4-114.3 months). After re-irradiation, acute and late G ≥ 2 GU toxicity events were reported in 3 (12%) and 10 (38%) patients, respectively, while late G ≥ 2 GI events were reported in 4 (15%) patients.

Neither the long-term efficacy nor safety of testosterone treatment has been studied in an adequately-powered randomized trial.  Methods:   The Testosterone Replacement therapy for Assessment of long-term Vascular Events and efficacy ResponSE in hypogonadal men (TRAVERSE) study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, non-inferiority, multicenter study. Eligible participants are men, 45 to 80 years, with serum testosterone concentration <300 ng/dL and hypogonadal symptoms, who have evidence pre-existing CV disease or increased risk of CV disease. Approximately 6,000 subjects will be randomized to either 1.62% transdermal testosterone gel or a matching placebo gel daily for an anticipated duration of up to 5 years. The primary outcome is CV safety defined by the major adverse CV event composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death due to CV causes. The trial will continue until at least 256 adjudicated major adverse CV event endpoints have occurred to assess whether the 95% (2-sided) upper confidence limit for a hazard ratio of 1.5 can be ruled out. Secondary endpoints include prostate safety defined as the incidence of adjudicated high grade prostate cancer and efficacy in domains of sexual function, bone fractures, depression, anemia, and diabetes.

This is partly due to the fact that certain regions of the cancer genome, due to their genomic and epigenomic properties, are more prone to dysregulated DNA methylation than others. Thus, it has been difficult to distinguish which promoter methylation changes are really driving carcinogenesis from those that are mostly just a reflection of their genomic location. By developing a novel method that corrects for epigenetic covariates, we reveal a small, concise set of potential epigenetic driver events. Interestingly, those changes suggest different modes of epigenetic carcinogenesis: first, we observe recurrent inactivation of known cancer genes across tumour types suggesting a higher convergence on common tumour suppressor pathways than previously anticipated. Second, in prostate cancer, a cancer type with few recurrently mutated genes, we demonstrate how the epigenome primes tumours towards higher tolerance of other aberrations.""","""['Richard Heery', 'Martin H Schaefer']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Nucleic Acids Res""","""['Impact of mutations in DNA methylation modification genes on genome-wide methylation landscapes and downstream gene activations in pan-cancer.', 'Epigenome remodelling in breast cancer: insights from an early in vitro model of carcinogenesis.', 'Association of expression of epigenetic molecular factors with DNA methylation and sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents in cancer cell lines.', 'DNA methylation alterations exhibit intraindividual stability and interindividual heterogeneity in prostate cancer metastases.', 'Glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTP1) hypermethylation in prostate cancer: review 2007.', 'Genome wide exploration of the methylome in aggressive B-cell lymphoma in Golden Retrievers reveals a conserved hypermethylome.', 'Editorial: DNA Methylation Dynamics and Human Diseases.', 'Pancancer Analyses Reveal Genomics and Clinical Characteristics of the SETDB1 in Human Tumors.', 'Regulation of protein complex partners as a compensatory mechanism in aneuploid tumors.']"""

While death rates have fallen for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers, death rates remain high for the majority of malignancies, primarily given the late stage at which they are diagnosed. The US Preventive Services Task Force currently recommends routine screening for just 4 cancers: breast, cervical, colorectal, and lung (for high-risk individuals); for prostate cancer, recommendations support individual decision making. However, cancers without recommended screening tests account for 71% of cancer deaths in the United States. In addition, screening rates remain below national goals, with numerous barriers to population-based screening. Recently, initial results of studies on blood-based multicancer early detection tests, which rely on measurement of a range of analytes, demonstrate the potential to identify multiple cancers in a single blood test and detect many cancers for which no screening tests are currently recommended. Blood-based tests have the potential to be more accessible and easier to disseminate than organ-specific tests. However, it remains unclear if their use can reduce deaths from these cancers.

In this study, to identify prognosis-related genes in breast cancer, the P value and the hazard ratio (HR) of all genes are analyzed with TCGA database.

However, higher expression level of JCHAIN, KLRB1, and TNFRSF14 was correlated to longer OS time in BRCA. The further analysis demonstrated MRPL13 was overexpressed in BRCA. Subtype analysis showed that MRPL13 was overexpressed in luminal, HER2-positive BRCA, and TNBC samples and was highest in TNBC samples. Moreover, we revealed higher expression of MRPL13 was significantly correlated to shorter OS time and higher TMB levels in BRCA. Pan-cancer analysis further revealed the prognostic value of MRPL13 in human cancers. MRPL13 expression was significantly increased in multiple human cancers, such as bladder cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, and prostate cancer. Pan-cancer TMB and overall survival time showed dysregulation of MRPL13 is significantly related to the OS and TMB levels in various cancers.

Less is known about its impact on new cancer diagnoses, where delays could cause worsening long-term outcomes. This study quantifies decreases in encounters related to prostate, lung, bladder and colorectal cancers, procedures that facilitate their diagnosis, and new diagnoses of those cancers in the COVID era compared to pre-COVID era.  Methods:   All encounters at Veterans' Affairs facilities nationwide from 2016 through 2020 were reviewed. The authors quantified trends in new diagnoses of cancer and in procedures facilitating their diagnosis, from January 1, 2018 onward. Using 2018 to 2019 as baseline, reductions in procedures and new cancer diagnoses in 2020 were estimated. Calculated absolute and percentage differences in annual volume and observed-to-expected volume ratios were calculated. Heat maps and funnel plots of volume changes were generated.  Results:   From 2018 through 2020, there were 4.1 million cancer-related encounters, 3.9 million relevant procedures, and 251,647 new cancers diagnosed. Compared to the annual averages in 2018 through 2019, colonoscopies in 2020 decreased by 45% whereas prostate biopsies, chest computed tomography scans, and cystoscopies decreased by 29%, 10%, and 21%, respectively. New cancer diagnoses decreased by 13% to 23%. These drops varied by state and continued to accumulate despite reductions in pandemic-related restrictions.  Conclusion:   The authors identified substantial reductions in procedures used to diagnose cancer and subsequent reductions in new diagnoses of cancer across the United States because of the COVID-19 pandemic. A nomogram is provided to identify and resolve these unmet health care needs and avoid worse long-term cancer outcomes.

Objective:   We aimed to fully characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of darolutamide, its diastereomers, and its main active metabolite, keto-darolutamide.  Methods:   Single-dose and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of 14C-labeled and non-labeled darolutamide were evaluated in healthy subjects and patients with hepatic or renal impairment.  Results:   Following darolutamide oral tablet administration, peak plasma concentrations were reached 4-6 h after dosing. Darolutamide elimination was characterized by a half-life of 13 h. Steady state was reached after approximately 2 days of twice-daily dosing. Pharmacokinetics of the diastereomers and keto-darolutamide followed similar trends to the parent compound. Darolutamide absorption from the tablet was lower than from the oral solution; tablet absolute bioavailability was ~30% in the fasted state but improved to 60-75% when given with food. The unbound fraction of darolutamide in plasma was 7.8%. The administered 1:1 ratio of the diastereomers (S,R)-darolutamide and (S,S)-darolutamide changed to ~1:6 in plasma following multiple dosing.

Materials and methods:   Health on the Net (HON) principles were used as a validated benchmark to assess the reliability of websites that appeared in the first 150 results of a search using the Google search engine. A variety of urological search terms were used, grouped into three broad categories with varying relevance to patients and medical students. Further analysis focussed on the sponsorship of assessed websites.  Results:   A total of 5400 websites were assessed for validation over a set of 36 search terms. Only 843/5400 (15.6%) of these were HONcode accredited, indicating a large proportion of unverified and potentially unreliable information. Search engine rankings usually favoured accredited websites (P = 0.009), and accreditation peaked at 51.1% (184/360) in the first page of results, but sorting became weaker outside the highest search results. The percentage of accredited websites varied significantly between different subcategories of search terms such as conditions (18.3% [329/1800], P = 0.003) and procedures (13.5% [243/1800], P = 0.043). Governmental/educational and commercial sources supported the majority of websites assessed for sponsorship (21% [31/150] and 33% [49/150], respectively), and the former were more likely to rank highly in search results.  Conclusion:   Online urological information frequently lacks validation and is often of indeterminate credibility. There is a marked decrease in the proportion of accredited websites beyond the highest-ranked results and when considering search categories more relevant to students and less relevant to patients.

The role of exosomal long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) has been reported not yet fully understood in the metastasis of PCa. Here, we discovered an exosomal lncRNA HOXD-AS1 is upregulated in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cell line derived exosomes and serum exosomes from metastatic PCa patients, which correlated with its tissue expression. Further investigation confirmed exosomal HOXD-AS1 promotes prostate cancer cell metastasis in vitro and in vivo by inducing metastasis associated phenotype. Mechanistically exosomal HOXD-AS1 was internalized directly by PCa cells, acting as competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to modulate the miR-361-5p/FOXM1 axis, therefore promoting PCa metastasis. In addition, we found that serum exosomal HOXD-AS1 was upregulated in metastatic PCa patients, especially those with high volume disease. And it is correlated closely with Gleason Score, distant and nodal metastasis, Prostatic specific antigen (PSA) recurrence free survival, and progression free survival (PFS).

This analysis aimed to estimate the burden of cancer and transition in cancer spectrum among older adults in China by 2030.  Methods:   Using data from the National Central Cancer Registry of China, we estimated annual percent change (APC) in cancer incidence and mortality rates among adults aged 60 years and above between 2006 and 2015 using joinpoint regression. We further estimated the number of new cancer cases and deaths from 2020 to 2030 based on the APC and population projections.  Results:   Although cancer incidence and mortality rates have been decreasing among older adults in China between 2006 and 2015, there were marked increases in the incidence and mortality rates of cervical (incidence: APC = 9.2%, mortality: APC = 7.6% all p < 0.05) and thyroid cancers (incidence: APC = 9.3%, p < 0.05) in older women. Between 2015 and 2030, the number of new cancer cases is projected to increase by 46% from 2.2 million to 3.2 million; cancer deaths will increase by 31% from 1.6 million to 2.1 million among older Chinese adults. In 2015, the 3 most common cancers were lung, colorectal and breast cancer in women, and lung, colorectal and stomach cancer in men. By 2030, cervical cancer is projected to be the most common cancer in women, followed by lung and thyroid cancer; prostate cancer will surpass stomach cancer to become the third most common cancer in men. In both sexes, lung, liver and stomach cancer were the top 3 leading causes of cancer deaths in 2015.

Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We evaluated the spectrum of gTP53 variants and clinical features associated with prostate cancer.  Results and limitations:   We identified 31 prostate cancer cases among 163 adult LFS males, including 26 of 54 aged ≥50 yr. Among 117 LFS males without prostate cancer at the time of genetic testing, six were diagnosed with prostate cancer over a median (interquartile range [IQR]) of 3.0 (1.3-7.2) yr of follow-up, a 25-fold increased risk (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.2-55; p < 0.0001). We identified gTP53 in 38 of 6850 males (0.6%) in the prostate cancer cohort, a relative risk 9.1-fold higher than that of population controls (95% CI 6.2-14; p < 0.0001; gnomAD). We observed hotspots at the sites of attenuated variants not associated with classic LFS. Two-thirds of available gTP53 prostate tumors had somatic inactivation of the second TP53 allele. Among gTP53 prostate cancer cases in this study, the median age at diagnosis was 56 (IQR: 51-62) yr, 44% had Gleason ≥8 tumors, and 29% had advanced disease at diagnosis.  Conclusions:   Complementary analyses of prostate cancer incidence in LFS males and gTP53 prevalence in prostate cancer cohorts suggest that gTP53 predisposes to aggressive prostate cancer.

This study aims to explore the expression level of miR-214-5p in prostate cancer and make a preliminary study of its molecular mechanism in the development of prostate cancer to provide effective new strategies for the treatment of prostate cancer.  Methods:   The target genes of miRNA-214-5p were predicted with bioinformatics technology, and the target relationship between miRNA-214-5p and its target genes was verified with dual luciferase reporter assay. RT-qPCR and Western blot were used to detect the expression levels of miRNA-214-5p and target genes in 50 clinical samples and two common prostate continuous cell lines, respectively. The targeting relationship between miRNA-214-5p and its target genes was verified with clinical data. miRNA-214-5p and miRNA-214-5p inhibitor was over-expressed in DU-145 cell lines to verify the effect of miRNA-214-5p on prostate cancer cell proliferation and SOX4 gene expression. And the mechanism of miRNA-214-5p inhibiting the proliferation of prostate cancer cells were analyzed by detecting the expression difference of downstream factors of SOX4 pathway. Bioinformatics analysis showed that miRNA-214-5p combined with SOX4 3'UTR region, and dual luciferase reporter assay further verified the reliability of the predicted results. The low expression of miRNA-214-5p was observed in prostate cancer tissues and cells, while high expression of SOX4 was observed in prostate cancer tissues and cells.  Results:   Overexpression of miRNA-214-5p to prostate cancer cells significantly inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells, and the expression of SOX4 was inhibited in the transfected cell line. After transfection of miRNA-214-5p inhibitor into prostate cancer cells, the cell proliferation rate further increased. Meanwhile, overexpression of miRNA-214-5p effectively inhibited the expression of SOX4 downstream factors, including c-Myc, eIF4E, and CDK4. However, the specific knockdown of SOX4 through SOX4 shRNA significantly reduced the proliferation of prostate cancer cell lines.

Methods:   A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted, describing the image-guidance approach by: pain, cost, accuracy, side effects, additional appointments, and additional time. Participants were males with prostate cancer (PCa) and from the general Australian population. A DCE survey required participants to make hypothetical choices in each of 8 choice sets. Multinomial logit modelling and Latent Class Analysis (LCA) were used to analyse the responses. Marginal willingness to pay (mWTP) was calculated.  Results:   476 respondents completed the survey (236 PCa patients and 240 general population). The most important attributes for both cohorts were pain, cost and accuracy (p < 0.01). PCa patients were willing to pay more to avoid the worst pain than the general population, and willing to pay more for increased accuracy. LCA revealed 3 groups: 2 were focused more on the process-related attributes of pain and cost, and the third was focused on the clinical efficacy attributes of accuracy and side effects.

A multicenter cluster randomized controlled trial with a 2×2 factorial design was performed to test the effectiveness of within-visit and previsit DAs for localized prostate cancer, and minority men were oversampled.  Methods:   The interventions were delivered in urology practices affiliated with the NCI Community Oncology Research Program Alliance Research Base. The primary outcome was prostate cancer knowledge (percent correct on a 12-item measure) assessed immediately after a urology consultation.  Results:   Four sites administered the previsit DA (39 patients), 4 sites administered the within-visit DA (44 patients), 3 sites administered both previsit and within-visit DAs (25 patients), and 4 sites provided usual care (50 patients). The median percent correct in prostate cancer knowledge, based on the postvisit knowledge assessment after the intervention delivery, was as follows: 75% for the pre+within-visit DA study arm, 67% for the previsit DA only arm, 58% for the within-visit DA only arm, and 58% for the usual-care arm. Neither the previsit DA nor the within-visit DA had a significant impact on patient knowledge of prostate cancer treatments at the prespecified 2.5% significance level (P = .132 and P = .977, respectively).

However, the lack of a clear prostate boundary, heterogeneity of prostate tissue, large variety of prostate shape and scarcity of annotated training data makes automatic segmentation a very challenging task. In this work, we proposed a novel two stage segmentation method to automatically segment prostate to support accurate and reproducible results with multisite and multivendor dataset. In the proposed method, we use the combination U-Net with residual blocks.  Methods:   The proposed method comprises two stage neural network, first is 2D U-Net, used find the approximate location of prostate, the second is the combination of U-Net and Res-Net used for accurate segmentation of prostate. The network was trained on 116 patient datasets from three publicly available data sources. 80% of data is used for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing. The commonly used segmentation evaluation metrics Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Sensitivity, and Specificity are used for quantitative evaluation of the network.  Results:   With the proposed method average DSC value of 93.8%, Sensitivity value of 94.6% and Specificity of 99.3% was achieved on test datasets.

We describe spatial compartment identity (A-open versus B-closed) changes with progression in these cell lines and their relation to gene expression changes in both cell lines and patient samples. In particular, 48 gene clusters switch from the B to the A compartment, including androgen receptor, WNT5A, and CDK14. These switches are accompanied by changes in the structure, size, and boundaries of topologically associating domains (TADs).

The range of malignancies seen is relatively limited and attributable to the particular cellular and molecular defects in each disease. CD4+ T-cell lymphopenia in people living with HIV infection (PLWH) and certain IEIs drive the predisposition to aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, including certain rare subtypes rarely seen in immunocompetent individuals. PLWH and IEI that lead to profound T-cell lymphopenia or dysfunction also are at risk of cancers related to oncogenic viruses such as Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus, Epstein-Barr virus, human papillomavirus (HPV), and Merkel cell polyomavirus. IEIs that affect natural killer cell development and/or function heavily predispose to HPV-associated epithelial cancers. Defects in DNA repair pathways compromise T- and B-lymphocyte development during immune receptor rearrangement in addition to affecting hematopoietic and epithelial DNA damage responses, resulting in both hematologic and nonhematologic cancers.

Patients with sporadic sessile serrated lesion (SSL) have risk for progression to CRC. Yet familial risks of common extracolonic cancers and even CRC in these cohorts are poorly understood. Our aim was to examine cancer risk for patients with SPS and sporadic SSL and their close and more distant relatives using a large population database.  Methods:   Patients with SPS (n = 59) from hereditary patient registries were eligible for study. Sporadic SSL (n = 754) and sex- and age-matched normal colonoscopy controls (n = 1,624) were selected from clinical data linked to the Utah Population Database. Cox models adjusting for the number of relatives, degree of relatedness, and person-years at risk were used to estimate CRC, extracolonic, and any-site adenocarcinoma/carcinoma cancer risk in patients and their relatives.  Results:   Compared with controls, CRC risk was elevated 10-fold in patients with SPS (P = 0.04) and 5-fold in their FDRs (P = 0.001). Any-site adenoma/carcinoma risk was increased 2.6-fold in FDRs of patients with SPS. No elevated risks of other common extracolonic cancers were observed in SPS and family members. The FDRs, second-degree relatives, and third-degree relatives of patients with both SSL and adenomatous polyps exhibited a 50% increased CRC risk.  Discussion:   Patients with SPS and their FDRs have an increased CRC risk, confirming other reports. Interestingly, patients with SSL were noted to have an increased risk of prostate cancer. Relatives of individuals with both sporadic SSL and adenomas, irrespective of size or dysplasia on examination, may have an elevated CRC risk, suggesting closer colonoscopy surveillance in this population.""","""['Priyanka Kanth', 'Zhe Yu', 'Megan B Keener', 'Cathryn Koptiuch', 'Wendy K Kohlmann', 'Deborah W Neklason', 'Michelle Westover', 'Karen Curtin']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Am J Gastroenterol""","""['Increased risk of colorectal neoplasia among family members of patients with colorectal cancer: a population-based study in Utah.', 'Yield of screening colonoscopy in first-degree relatives of patients with serrated polyposis syndrome.', 'Risk of colorectal cancer and adenomas in the families of patients with adenomas: a population-based study in Utah.', 'Serrated polyposis syndrome; epidemiology and management.', 'Current Approaches in Managing Colonic Serrated Polyps and Serrated Polyposis.']"""

Serum steroid levels did not affect the association of BMI with prostate cancer risk; however, IGFBP2 and IGFs modified the association of obesity with low- and high-grade disease.

This study sought to investigate trends in socioeconomic inequalities in prostate cancer incidence among Canadian males.  Methods:   Using a census division level dataset (n = 280) constructed from the Canadian Cancer Registry, Canadian Census of Population (1992, 1996, 2001, 2006) and 2011 National Household Survey, we examined the effect of socioeconomic status on prostate cancer incidence among Canadian males between 1992 and 2010. The age-adjusted concentration index was used to quantify education/income-related inequalities in prostate cancer incidence.  Results:   The crude prostate cancer incidence increased from 115 to 137 per 100 000 males in Canada from 1992 to 2010 with a peak in 2007. The rate increased significantly in all but three of four western provinces. The age-adjusted concentration index showed a higher concentration of prostate cancer diagnoses among males living in high-income neighbourhoods in Canada in particular from 1996 to 2005. In contrast, the index was higher among males living in less-educated neighbourhoods in the most recent study years (2006-2010).  Conclusions:   The concentration of new prostate cancer cases among high-income populations in Canada may be explained by the rise of opportunistic screening of asymptomatic males; however, this should be studied in further detail. Since we found a higher incidence rate of prostate cancer among less-educated males in Canada in recent years, risk-benefit investigation of primary prevention and opportunistic screening for less-educated males is advised.""","""['Mohammad Hajizadeh', 'Ashley Whelan', 'Grace M Johnston', 'Robin Urquhart']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Control""","""['Socioeconomic inequalities in colorectal cancer incidence in Canada: trends over two decades.', 'Socio-economic inequalities in lung cancer incidence in Canada, 1992-2010: results from the Canadian Cancer Registry.', 'Trends in socio-economic inequalities in bladder cancer incidence in Canada: 1992-2010.', 'Skin cancer screening in Switzerland: Cross-sectional trends (1997-2012) in socioeconomic inequalities.', 'Incidence, factors, and disparities related to cancer among Black individuals in Canada: A scoping review.', 'Global burden of prostate cancer attributable to smoking among males in 204 countries and territories, 1990-2019.']"""

We recently described three subtypes of prostate cancer bone metastases (MetA-C), based on differential gene expression. The aim of this study was to verify the clinical relevance of these subtypes and to explore their biology and relations to genetic drivers. Freshly-frozen metastasis samples were obtained as hormone-naive (n = 17), short-term castrated (n = 21), or castration-resistant (n = 65) from a total of 67 patients. Previously published sequencing data from 573 metastasis samples were also analyzed. Through transcriptome profiling and sample classification based on a set of predefined MetA-C-differentiating genes, we found that most metastases were heterogeneous for the MetA-C subtypes. Overall, MetA was the most common subtype, while MetB was significantly enriched in castration-resistant samples and in liver metastases, and consistently associated with poor prognosis. By gene set enrichment analysis, the phenotype of MetA was described by high androgen response, protein secretion and adipogenesis, MetB by high cell cycle activity and DNA repair, and MetC by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and inflammation. The MetB subtype demonstrated single nucleotide variants of RB transcriptional corepressor 1 (RB1) and loss of 21 genes at chromosome 13, including RB1, but provided independent prognostic value to those genetic aberrations. In conclusion, a distinct set of gene transcripts can be used to classify prostate cancer metastases into the subtypes MetA-C. The MetA-C subtypes show diverse biology, organ tropism, and prognosis. The MetA-C classification may be used independently, or in combination with genetic markers, primarily to identify MetB patients in need of complementary therapy to conventional androgen receptor-targeting treatments.""","""['Elin Thysell', 'Linda Köhn', 'Julius Semenas', 'Helena Järemo', 'Eva Freyhult', 'Marie Lundholm', 'Camilla Thellenberg Karlsson', 'Jan-Erik Damber', 'Anders Widmark', 'Sead Crnalic', 'Andreas Josefsson', 'Karin Welén', 'Rolf J A Nilsson', 'Anders Bergh', 'Pernilla Wikström']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mol Oncol""","""['Gene expression profiles define molecular subtypes of prostate cancer bone metastases with different outcomes and morphology traceable back to the primary tumor.', 'A novel DNA methylation signature is associated with androgen receptor activity and patient prognosis in bone metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Subgroups of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases Defined Through an Inverse Relationship Between Androgen Receptor Activity and Immune Response.', 'Treating Patients with Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review of Available Therapies.', 'Androgen receptor variants in prostate cancer.', 'Bone Metastases and Health in Prostate Cancer: From Pathophysiology to Clinical Implications.', 'A Novel Radiographic Pattern Related to Poor Prognosis in Patients with Prostate Cancer with Metastatic Spinal Cord Compression.', 'Epithelial and Stromal Characteristics of Primary Tumors Predict the Bone Metastatic Subtype of Prostate Cancer and Patient Survival after Androgen-Deprivation Therapy.', 'Osteoclasts directly influence castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.']"""

We report here a prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and esterase dual responsive self-assembled nanoparticles (CPT-WT-H NPs) for highly efficient CPT delivery and effective cancer therapy.  Methods and results:   In this study, smart self-assembled nanoparticles CPT-WT-H NPs were elaborately designed and synthesized by combing hydrophobic CPT with hydrophilic PSMA-responsive penta-peptide via a cleavable ester bond. This dual responsive nanoparticle with negatively charged surface first respond to the extracellular PSMA and then to the intracellular esterase, achieving a programmable release of CPT at the tumor site and producing the byproducts of biocompatible glutamic acid and aspartic acid. Our data demonstrated that CPT-WT-H NPs exhibited greatly improved water solubility and stability. Results from MTT and flow cytometry showed CPT-WT-H NPs exhibited significantly higher cytotoxicity as well as apoptosis-inducing activity against PSMA-expressing LNCaP-FGC cells than the non-PSMA-expressing cancer cells, showing excellent cytotoxic selectivity. Moreover, the unique nanostructure provided the efficient transportation of CPT to tumor site, which resulted in the effective inhibition of tumor growth and low systemic toxicity in vivo.

Methods: In total, 138 patients (mean age, 70 ± 9 y; age range, 46-90 y) with progressive mCRPC and PSMA expression verified by 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT underwent PRLT. Fifty-one patients received 6.1 ± 1.0 GBq (range, 3.4-7.6 GBq) of 177Lu-PSMA I&T, and 87 patients received 6.5 ± 1.1 GBq (range, 3.5-9.0 GBq) of 177Lu-PSMA-617. Dosimetry was performed on all patients using an identical protocol. The mean absorbed doses were estimated with OLINDA software (MIRD Scheme). Treatment-related adverse events were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0, of the National Cancer Institute. Results: The whole-body half-lives were shorter for 177Lu-PSMA I&T (35 h) than for 177Lu-PSMA-617 (42 h). The mean whole-body dose of 177Lu-PSMA-617 was higher than that of 177Lu-PSMA I&T (0.04 vs. 0.03 Gy/GBq, P < 0.00001). Despite the longer half-life of 177Lu-PSMA-617, the renal dose was lower for 177Lu-PSMA-617 than for 177Lu-PSMA I&T (0.77 vs. 0.92 Gy/GBq, P = 0.0015). Both PSMA small molecules demonstrated a comparable dose to the parotid glands (0.5 Gy/GBq, P = 0.27). Among all normal organs, the lacrimal glands exhibited the highest mean absorbed doses, 5.1 and 3.7 Gy/GBq, for 177Lu-PSMA-617 and 177Lu-PSMA I&T, respectively. All tumor metastases exhibited a higher initial uptake when using 177Lu-PSMA I&T than when using 177Lu-PSMA-617, as well as a shorter tumor half-life (P < 0.00001). The mean absorbed tumor doses were comparable for both 177Lu-PSMA I&T and 177Lu-PSMA-617 (5.8 vs. 5.9 Gy/GBq, P = 0.96). All patients tolerated the therapy without any acute adverse effects. After 177Lu-PSMA-617 and 177Lu-PSMA I&T, there was a small, statistically significant reduction in hemoglobin, leukocyte counts, and platelet counts that did not need any clinical intervention. No nephrotoxicity was observed after either 177Lu-PSMA I&T or 177Lu-PSMA-617 PRLT. Conclusion: Both 177Lu-PSMA I&T and 177Lu-PSMA-617 PRLT demonstrated favorable safety in mCRPC patients. The highest absorbed doses among healthy organs were in the lacrimal and parotid glands-not, however, resulting in any significant clinical sequel. 177Lu-PSMA-617 demonstrated a higher absorbed dose to the whole-body and lacrimal glands but a lower renal dose than did 177Lu-PSMA I&T. The mean absorbed tumor doses were comparable for both 177Lu-PSMA I&T and 177Lu-PSMA-617. There was a large interpatient variability in the dosimetry parameters. Therefore, individual patient-based dosimetry seems favorable for personalized PRLT.""","""['Christiane Schuchardt', 'Jingjing Zhang', 'Harshad R Kulkarni', 'Xiaoyuan Chen', 'Dirk Müller', 'Richard P Baum']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Examining Absorbed Doses of Indigenously Developed 177Lu-PSMA-617 in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients at Baseline and During Course of Peptide Receptor Radioligand Therapy.', 'Pretherapeutic Comparative Dosimetry of 177Lu-rhPSMA-7.3 and 177Lu-PSMA I&T in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Radiation Dosimetry for 177Lu-PSMA I&T in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Absorbed Dose in Normal Organs and Tumor Lesions.', 'Hematologic toxicity profile and efficacy of 225AcAc-PSMA-617 α-radioligand therapy of patients with extensive skeletal metastases of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan for prostate cancer.', 'Novel radionuclide therapy combinations in prostate cancer.', 'Rationale for Prostate-Specific-Membrane-Antigen-Targeted Radionuclide Theranostic Applied to Metastatic Clear Cell Renal Carcinoma.', 'Safety of Lutetium-177 prostate-specific membrane antigen-617 (PSMA-617) radioligand therapy in the setting of severe renal impairment: a case report and literature review.', 'Determinants of outcome following PSMA-based radioligand therapy and mechanisms of resistance in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Advances in landscape and related therapeutic targets of the prostate tumor microenvironment.']"""

Objective:   The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the capability of a digital autoradiography system equipped with a laser scanning device to perform [18F] choline biodistribution evaluation in a xenograft mouse model of prostate cancer.  Methods:   PC3 prostate cancer cells were used to develop NOD/SCID mice xenografts. The biodistribution of the radiopharmaceuticals was evaluated at 30, 60, and 120 min after injecting in excised organs by using a digital autoradiography system equipped with a super-resolution laser screen. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses were performed to correlate the [18F] choline uptake with morphological and molecular tumours characteristics.  Results:   The reported data clearly indicate the possibility of performing accurate biodistribution studies using the digital autoradiographic system equipped with a super-resolution screen. Specifically, a significant increase in the [18F] choline inhibitor uptake in PC3 tumours compared to heart, bowel, liver, and kidney at both 30 and 60 min was observed. More importantly, the digital autoradiographic system showed signal uptake almost exclusively in the PC3 tumors at 60 min post-injection. Noteworthy, immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated a strong overlapping between the [18F] choline uptake and the proliferation index (Ki67 expression).

The enzyme is membrane-bound, and a crystal structure is not yet available. Selective aryl benzylamine-based inhibitors were designed and synthesised as potential agents for prostate cancer therapeutics through structure-based design, using a previously built homology model with docking studies. Potent, selective, low nanomolar IC50 17β-HSD3 inhibitors were discovered using N-(2-([2-(4-chlorophenoxy)phenylamino]methyl)phenyl)acetamide (1). The most potent compounds have IC50 values of approximately 75 nM. Compound 29, N-[2-(1-Acetylpiperidin-4-ylamino)benzyl]-N-[2-(4-chlorophenoxy)phenyl]acetamide, has an IC50 of 76 nM, while compound 30, N-(2-(1-[2-(4-chlorophenoxy)-phenylamino]ethyl)phenyl)acetamide, has an IC50 of 74 nM. Racemic C-allyl derivative 26 (IC50 of 520 nM) was easily formed from 1 in good yield and, to determine binding directionality, its enantiomers were separated by chiral chromatography. Absolute configuration was determined using single crystal X-ray crystallography. Only the S-(+)-enantiomer (32) was active with an IC50 of 370 nM. Binding directionality was predictable through our in silico docking studies, giving confidence to our model. Importantly, all novel inhibitors are selective over the type 2 isozyme of 17β-HSD2 and show <20% inhibition when tested at 10 µM.

When trying to clone transcripts of KLKP1, we partly failed. Instead, we identified an androgen-regulated transcript, KLK4T2, which appeared to be a splice variant of KLK4 that also contained exons of KLKP1. Expression analysis of KLK4, KLK4T2, and KLKP1 transcripts in prostate cancer cell lines showed high levels of KLKP1 transcripts in the nucleus and in unfractionated cell extract, whereas it was almost completely absent in the cytoplasmatic fraction. This was in contrast to KLK4 and KLK4T2, which displayed high to moderate levels in the cytoplasm. In patient cohorts we found significantly higher expression of both KLK4T2 and KLK4 in benign prostatic hyperplasia compared to both primary prostate cancer and bone metastasis. Analysis of tissue panels demonstrated the highest expression of KLK4T2 in the prostate, but in contrast to the classical KLK4, relatively high levels were also found in placenta. So far, the function of KLK4T2 is still to be explored, but the structure of the translation product indicated that it generates a 17.4 kDa intracellular protein with possible regulatory function.""","""['Åke Lundwall', 'Erik Bovinder Ylitalo', 'Pernilla Wikström', 'Maria Brattsand']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Pseudogene Associated Recurrent Gene Fusion in Prostate Cancer.', 'Compartmentalized expression of kallikrein 4 (KLK4/hK4) isoforms in prostate cancer: nuclear, cytoplasmic and secreted forms.', 'A novel transcript from the KLKP1 gene is androgen regulated, down-regulated during prostate cancer progression and encodes the first non-serine protease identified from the human kallikrein gene locus.', 'Prostate-specific antigen, its molecular forms, and other kallikrein markers for detection of prostate cancer.', 'Structures and specificity of the human kallikrein-related peptidases KLK 4, 5, 6, and 7.', 'Loss of KLK4::KLKP1 pseudogene expression by RNA chromogenic in-situ hybridization is associated with PTEN loss and increased risk of biochemical recurrence in a cohort of middle eastern men with prostate cancer.']"""

Most of these deaths are associated with metastasis, a process involving the epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) transition. Furthermore, growing evidence suggests that partial-EMT (p-EMT) may lead to more aggressive disease than complete EMT. In this study, the EMT-inducing transcription factor Zeb1 was knocked down in mesenchymal PC-3 prostate cancer cells (Zeb1KD) and resulting changes in cellular phenotype were assessed using protein and RNA analysis, invasion and migration assays, cell morphology assays, and DNA methylation chip analysis. Inducible knockdown of Zeb1 resulted in a p-EMT phenotype including co-expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers, a mixed epithelial/mesenchymal morphology, increased invasion and migration, and enhanced expression of p-EMT markers relative to PC-3 mesenchymal controls (p ≤ 0.05). Treatment of Zeb1KD cells with the global de-methylating drug 5-azacytidine (5-aza) mitigated the observed aggressive p-EMT phenotype (p ≤ 0.05). DNA methylation chip analysis revealed 10 potential targets for identifying and/or targeting aggressive p-EMT prostate cancer in the future. These findings provide a framework to enhance prognostic and/or therapeutic options for aggressive prostate cancer in the future by identifying new p-EMT biomarkers to classify patients with aggressive disease who may benefit from 5-aza treatment.""","""['Jenna Kitz', 'Cory Lefebvre', 'Joselia Carlos', 'Lori E Lowes', 'Alison L Allan']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['The role of epithelial-mesenchymal transition drivers ZEB1 and ZEB2 in mediating docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Insulin-like growth factor-I-dependent up-regulation of ZEB1 drives epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in human prostate cancer cells.', 'UBE2C, Directly Targeted by miR-548e-5p, Increases the Cellular Growth and Invasive Abilities of Cancer Cells Interacting with the EMT Marker Protein Zinc Finger E-box Binding Homeobox 1/2 in NSCLC.', 'The Transcription Factors Zeb1 and Snail Induce Cell Malignancy and Cancer Stem Cell Phenotype in Prostate Cells, Increasing Androgen Synthesis Capacity and Therapy Resistance.', 'Role of ZEB Family Members in Proliferation, Metastasis, and Chemoresistance of Prostate Cancer Cells: Revealing Signaling Networks.', 'PAX5-miR-142 feedback loop promotes breast cancer proliferation by regulating DNMT1 and ZEB1.', 'Emergent dynamics of underlying regulatory network links EMT and androgen receptor-dependent resistance in prostate cancer.', 'The Metastatic Process through the Eyes of Epigenetic Regulation: A Promising Horizon for Cancer Therapy.', 'Transcriptomic and immunologic implications of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition model reveal a novel role of SFTA2 in prognosis of non-small-cell lung carcinoma.']"""

Materials and methods:   Among 1,117 patients who had received SRT, data from 205 hormone-naïve patients who experienced post-SRT prostate-specific antigen (PSA) elevation were included in a multi-institutional database. The primary endpoint was to determine the PSA parameters predictive of distant metastasis (DM). Absolute serum PSA levels and the prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSA-DT) were adopted as PSA parameters.  Results:   When BCR was defined based on serum PSA levels ranging from 0.4 ng/mL to nadir+2.0 ng/mL, the 5-year probability of DM was 27.6%-33.7%. The difference in the 5-year probability of DM became significant when BCR was defined as a serum PSA level of 0.8 ng/ml or higher (1.0-2.0 ng/mL). Application of a serum PSA level of ≥ 0.8 ng/mL yielded a c-index value of 0.589. When BCR was defined based on the PSA-DT, the 5-year probability was 22.7%-39.4%. The difference was significant when BCR was defined as a PSA-DT ≤ 3 months and ≤ 6 months. Application of a PSA-DT ≤ 6 months yielded the highest c-index (0.660). These two parameters complemented each other; for patients meeting both PSA parameters, the probability of DM was 39.5%-44.5%; for those not meeting either parameter, the probability was 0.0%-3.1%.  Conclusion:   A serum PSA level > 0.8 ng/mL was a reasonable threshold for the definition of BCR after SRT. In addition, a PSA-DT ≤ 6 months was significantly predictive of subsequent DM, and combined application of both parameters enhanced predictability.""","""['Sung Uk Lee', 'Jae-Sung Kim', 'Young Seok Kim', 'Jaeho Cho', 'Seo Hee Choi', 'Taek-Keun Nam', 'Song Mi Jeong', 'Youngkyong Kim', 'Youngmin Choi', 'Dong Eun Lee', 'Won Park', 'Kwan Ho Cho']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Res Treat""","""['Integrating Prostate-specific Antigen Kinetics into Contemporary Predictive Nomograms of Salvage Radiotherapy After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Optimal definition of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy depends on pathologic risk factors: identifying candidates for early salvage therapy.', 'The PSA-response to salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy correlates with freedom from progression and overall survival.', 'Natural history of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy: risk assessment for secondary therapy.', 'Prostate specific antigen only progression of prostate cancer.']"""

We sought a simplified method in which changes in gene expression might be measured in human peripheral blood to detect incorporated radionuclides. Such an approach could be used to quickly determine internal exposure in instances of a radiological dispersal device or a radiation accident.  Materials and methods:   We evaluated whole blood samples from five patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and multiple bone metastases (without visceral or nodal involvement), who underwent treatment with the alpha emitting isotope Radium-223 dichloride (Ra-223, Xofigo®). Patients received about 4 MBq per cycle and, depending on survival and treatment tolerance, were followed for six months. We collected 24 blood samples approximately monthly corresponding to treatment cycle.  Results:   Firstly, we conducted whole genome screening of mRNAs (mRNA seq) and small RNAs (small RNA seq) using next generation sequencing in one patient at eight different time points during all six cycles of Ra-223-therapy. We identified 1900 mRNAs and 972 small RNAs (222 miRNAs) that were differentially up- or down-regulated during follow-up after the first treatment with Ra-223. Overall candidate RNA species inclusion criteria were a general (≥|2|-fold) change or with peaking profiles (≥|5|-fold) at specific points in time. Next we chose 72 candidate mRNAs and 101 small RNAs (comprising 29 miRNAs) for methodologic (n = 8 samples, one patient) and independent (n = 16 samples, four patients) validation by qRT-PCR. In total, 15 mRNAs (but no small RNAs) were validated by methodologic and independent testing. However, the deregulation occurred at different time points, showing a large inter-individual variability in response among patients.  Conclusions:   This proof of concept provides support for the applicability of gene expression measurements to detect internalized alpha-emitting radionuclides, but further work is needed with a larger sample size. While our approach has merit for internal deposition monitoring, it was complicated by the severe clinical condition of the patients we studied.""","""['Patrick Ostheim', 'Matthias Miederer', 'Mathias Schreckenberger', 'Tim Nestler', 'Manuela A Hoffmann', 'Michael Lassmann', 'Uta Eberlein', 'Vahe Barsegian', 'Alexis Rump', 'Mattháus Majewski', 'Matthias Port', 'Michael Abend']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Biol""","""['Radium-223 for the treatment of bone metastases in castration-resistant prostate cancer: when and why.', 'Radium Ra 223 dichloride in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Alpha emitter radium-223 dichloride: new therapy in castration-resistant prostate cancer with symptomatic bone metastases.', 'Impact of pre-treatment variables on the completion of 223radium-dichloride therapy in mCRPC patients with bone metastases.', 'Radium-223 dichloride: a novel treatment option for castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with symptomatic bone metastases.']"""

A mono-exponential fitting model was used to automatically create ADC maps with minimum b-values of 0 and maximum of 2000 s/mm2. For detectable lesions on ADC maps, the lesions were manually segmented on each slice of the ADC maps. For undetectable lesions, the corresponding normal-appearing zone of the lobe on each slice of ADC maps was segmented. The ADC data for each slice were summed to obtain the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile ADC values of the histogram at baseline and second MRI. These ADC parameters at baseline and second MRI, and the changes of ADC parameters from baseline to second MRI were compared between PRIAS non-reclassification and reclassification groups.

We are currently seeing the rapid development of [68Ga/177Lu]PSMA theragnostics in metastatic prostate cancer. While these applications are very promising, there are a number of practicalities which must be addressed in the development and introduction of novel theragnostics. The physical half-lives of the diagnostic and therapeutic radionuclides must be appropriate for imaging and delivery of targeted cell killing, respectively. The types of radioactive emissions are critical; beta particles can traverse several millimeters but also risk damaging non-target tissues, while alpha particles deliver their energy over a much shorter path length, a few cell diameters, and must be more directly targeted. It must be practical to produce the therapeutic radionuclide and the final radiopharmaceutical and deliver them to the final user within an appropriate time-frame determined by half-life and stability. The biodistribution of the agent must demonstrate adequate accumulation and retention in the target tissue with clearance from adjacent and/or radio-sensitive normal tissues.

Patients who are female, of other race, unmarried, and with distant tumor stage have greater SMRs. A higher SMR was associated with a younger age at diagnosis. Among those aged < 40 years at diagnosis, the plurality of fatal peptic ulcers occurred in patients with leukemia and lymphoma, while in patients aged > 40 years, the majority occurred in those with prostate, breast, colorectum, and lung cancer. Patients with upper digestive system malignancies had the highest SMRs and hazard ratios (HRs), which could be ascribed to radiotherapy-induced damage to the gastroduodenum. The risk declined rapidly one year after diagnosis. However, the SMRs in the upper digestive system cancer survivors increased significantly over ten years after diagnosis. Upper digestive system cancers adjacent to the gastroduodenum were associated with higher SMRs and HRs compared with other types of cancer, possibly contributing partially to the damage caused by radiotherapy on the radiosensitive gastroduodenum.""","""['Pengcheng Yang#', 'Yongqiang Zheng#', 'Lei Zhang', 'Xiaohua Hou']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Diabetic mortality risk among cancer patients in the United State SEER population, 1975-2016.', 'Deaths from COPD in patients with cancer: a population-based study.', 'Cause of death during prostate cancer survivorship: A contemporary, US population-based analysis.', 'A population-based study of cardiovascular disease mortality risk in US cancer patients.', 'Causes of death among cancer patients.', 'Cause of Death Among Patients With Thyroid Cancer: A Population-Based Study.']"""

Docetaxel is the first cytotoxic chemotherapeutical approved for treatment of PCa. However, 99% of PCa patients will develop resistance to docetaxel within 3 years. Understanding how resistance arises is important to increasing PCa survival.  Methods:   In this study, we modeled docetaxel resistance using two PCa cell lines: DU145 and PC3. Using the Passing Attributes between Networks for Data Assimilation (PANDA) method to model transcription factor (TF) activity networks in both sensitive and resistant variants of the two cell lines. We identified edges and nodes shared by both PCa cell lines that composed a shared TF network that modeled changes which occur during acquisition of docetaxel resistance in PCa. We subjected the shared TF network to connectivity map analysis (CMAP) to identify potential drugs that could disrupt the resistant networks. We validated the candidate drug in combination with docetaxel to treat docetaxel-resistant PCa in both in vitro and in vivo models.  Results:   In the final shared TF network, 10 TF nodes were identified as the main nodes for the development of docetaxel resistance. CMAP analysis of the shared TF network identified trichostatin A (TSA) as a candidate adjuvant to reverse docetaxel resistance. In cell lines, the addition of TSA to docetaxel enhanced cytotoxicity of docetaxel resistant PCa cells with an associated reduction of the IC50 of docetaxel on the resistant cells. In the PCa mouse model, combination of TSA and docetaxel reduced tumor growth and final weight greater than either drug alone or vehicle.  Conclusions:   We identified a shared TF activity network that drives docetaxel resistance in PCa. We also demonstrated a novel combination therapy to overcome this resistance. This study highlights the usage of novel application of single cell RNA-sequencing and subsequent network analyses that can reveal novel insights which have the potential to improve clinical outcomes.""","""['Patricia M Schnepp', 'Aqila Ahmed', 'June Escara-Wilke', 'Jinlu Dai', 'Greg Shelley', 'Jill Keller', 'Atsushi Mizokami', 'Evan T Keller']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Single-Cell Transcriptomics Analysis Identifies Nuclear Protein 1 as a Regulator of Docetaxel Resistance in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Hyper-acetylation contributes to the sensitivity of chemo-resistant prostate cancer cells to histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A.', 'The prognostic utility of the transcription factor SRF in docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer: in-vitro discovery and in-vivo validation.', 'Mechanisms of docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer: The key role played by miRNAs.', 'Pharmacological Properties of Trichostatin A, Focusing on the Anticancer Potential: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Advances and Applications of Brain Organoids.', 'Integration of Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing and Network Analysis to Investigate Mechanisms of Drug Resistance.']"""

Patients and methods:   A prospective, randomised, non-blinded, feasibility clinical trial with an embedded QuinteT Recruitment Intervention (QRI) to optimise recruitment was conducted in nine nationwide tertiary care centres undertaking high-volume robotic surgery. We aimed to randomise 50 men with synchronous oligo-metastatic prostate cancer within an 18-month recruitment period to SOC systemic therapy vs SOC plus RP (intervention arm). The main outcome measures were: ability to randomise patients, optimised by a QRI; EuroQoL five Dimensions five Levels (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaires to capture quality-of-life (QoL) data at baseline and 3 months post-randomisation; routine clinicopathological assessment to capture adverse events and prostate-specific antigen in both arms, plus standard perioperative parameters in the surgical arm.  Results:   A total of 51 men were randomised within 14 months (one was subsequently deemed ineligible), with 60-83% accrual rate in centres that recruited at least two patients. All patients completed the trial follow-up; one patient in the intervention arm subsequently did not undergo the surgical intervention and one in the SOC arm refused all therapies. The QRI positively impacted recruitment. QoL data showed similarly high functioning in both study arms. Surgery for men with oligo-metastatic prostate cancer was found to be safe and had similar impact on early functional outcomes as surgery for standard indication.  Conclusion:   It is feasible to randomise men with synchronous oligo-metastatic prostate cancer to a surgical intervention in addition to standard systemic therapies.

Methods:   A framework of HRQoL domain/domain elements was developed, informed by analysis of published patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), applicable to prostate cancer. Using mixed methods (eDelphi, Nominal Group Technique and questionnaire), prostate cancer clinicians and patients attending prostate cancer clinics and support groups were asked which domains/domain elements would be important to them when discussing the impact prostate cancer medicines have on their HRQoL.  Results:   Twenty-one clinicians and 71 patients participated from the West of Scotland. Clinicians and patients identified 53/62 domain elements across seven domains as important, of which 32 (60%) were common to both groups. Clinicians placed more importance than patients on Mood & Emotion; in contrast, patients placed importance on a broader range of Symptoms & Side Effects, being informed about their care, and having effective healthcare professional collaboration.  Conclusion:   This study provides insight into the similarities and differences between what clinicians and patients think is important when discussing the impact of cancer medicines on HRQoL.

Materials and methods:   36 prospective participants with biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer underwent 3 T MRI prior to radical prostatectomy. Axial HM-MRI was acquired with all combinations of echo times of 57, 70, 150, 200 ms and b-values of 0, 150, 750, 1500 s/mm2 and data were fitted using a 3-compartment signal model using custom software to generate volumes for each tissue component (stroma, epithelium, lumen). Three experienced genitourinary pathologists independently as well as in consensus reviewed each histology image and provide an estimate of percentage of epithelium and lumen for regions-of-interest corresponding to MRI (n = 165; 64 prostate cancers and 101 benign tissue). Agreement statistics using total deviation index (TDI0.9) was performed for tissue composition measured using HM-MRI and reference standard results from pathologists' consensus.  Results:   Based on the initial results showing typical variation among pathologists TDI0.9 = 25%, we determined we will declare acceptable agreement if the 95% one-sided upper confident limit of TDI0.9 is less than 30%. The results of tissue composition measurement from HM-MRI compared to ground truth results from the consensus of 3 pathologists, reveal that ninety percent of absolute paired differences (TDI0.9) were within 18.8% and 22.4% in measuring epithelium and lumen, respectively. We are 95% confident that 90% of absolute paired differences were within 20.6% and 24.2% in measuring epithelium and lumen, respectively. These were less than our criterion of 30% and inter-pathologists' agreement (22.3% for epithelium and 24.2% for lumen) and therefore we accept the agreement performance of HM-MRI. The results revealed excellent area under the ROC curve for differentiating cancer from benign tissue based on epithelium (HM-MRI: 0.87, pathologists: 0.97) and lumen volume (HM-MRI: 0.85, pathologists: 0.77).

Methods:   GG2 prostatectomy specimens of patients with concomitant lymph node metastasis or distant metastasis at follow-up were identified in a clinical database of a tertiary care center and their pathology was reviewed for pathological stage, lymphovascular invasion, Gleason grade 4 subpatterns, presence of tertiary grade 5, and ductal adenocarcinoma histology. A control group of 99 GG2 prostatectomy specimens who had no metastatic disease (controls) was reviewed for the same adverse pathological features.  Results:   Of 1860 GG2 prostatectomy specimens (operated between 2002 and 2020), 45 (2.4%) had concurrent regional lymph node metastases or distant metastases at follow-up. Pathological stage distribution of cases and controls was 24% and 79% pT2, 42% and 15% pT3a, 33% and 6.1% pT3b -T4, respectively (p < 0.001). Eleven of 45 cases (24%) had ≤10% Gleason grade 4 component. Cribriform pattern or intraductal carcinoma was present in 84% of cases versus 34% of controls (p < 0.001), tertiary grade 5 in 16% of cases versus 5% controls (p = 0.05) and ductal adenocarcinoma in 16% of cases versus 2% of controls (p = 0.004).

Conclusions:   Well-established unfavorable histopathologic features (intraductal and cribriform pattern carcinoma, ductal adenocarcinoma) are represented in about 90% of GG2 prostate cancers with local or distant metastatic disease and are much less common (38%) in those without metastatic disease. Strikingly, about 25% of GG2 prostatectomy cases with metastatic disease had an organ-confined disease and/or a small percentage of Gleason grade 4 pattern.

However, the role of PI-RADS scores in patients already diagnosed with prostate cancer remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association of PI-RADS scores with prostate cancer upstaging. Upstaging on final pathology harbors a higher risk for biochemical recurrence with important implications for additional treatments, morbidity, and mortality.  Methods:   All patients from a single high-volume institution who underwent a prostate multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and radical prostatectomy between 2016 and 2020 were included in this retrospective analysis. Univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted to investigate potential associations with upstaging events, defined by pT3, pT4, or N1 on final pathology. A logistic regression model was constructed for the prediction of upstaging events based on PI-RADS score, prostate-specific antigen density (PSA-D), and biopsy Gleason grade groups. We built receiver operative characteristic (ROC) curves to measure the area under the curve of different predictive models.  Results:   Two hundred and ninety-four patients were included in the final analysis. Upstaging events occurred in 137 (46.5%) of patients. On univariable analysis, patients who were upstaged on final pathology had significantly higher PI-RADS scores (odds ratio [OR] 2.34 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.64-3.40, p < 0.001) but similar PSA-D (OR 2.70 95% 0.94-8.43, p = 0.188) compared with patients who remained pT1 or pT2 on final pathology. On multivariable analysis, PI-RADS remained independently significantly associated with upstaging, suggesting it is an independent risk predictor for upstaging. Lymph node metastasis only occurred in patients with PI-RADS 4 or 5 lesions (n = 15). Our model using PSA-D, biopsy Gleason grade, and PI-RADS had a predictive AUC of 0.69 for upstaging events, an improvement from 0.59 using biopsy Gleason grade alone.  Conclusion:   PI-RADS scores are independent predictors for upstaging events and may play an important role in forecasting biochemical recurrence and lymph node metastasis. Modern nomograms should be updated to include PI-RADS to predict lymph node metastases and the likelihood of biochemical recurrence more accurately.""","""['Benjamin Pockros', 'Kristian D Stensland', 'Molly Parries', 'Edward Frankenberger', 'David Canes', 'Alireza Moinzadeh']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['PI-RADS Version 2 Category on 3 Tesla Multiparametric Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging Predicts Oncologic Outcomes in Gleason 3 + 4 Prostate Cancer on Biopsy.', 'Histological comparison between predictive value of preoperative 3-T multiparametric MRI and 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan for pathological outcomes at radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection for prostate cancer.', 'PI-RADS Version 2 Category on 3 Tesla Multiparametric Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging Predicts Oncologic Outcomes in Gleason 3 + 4 Prostate Cancer on Biopsy.', 'Pathological and 3 Tesla Volumetric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Predictors of Biochemical Recurrence after Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Correlation with Whole Mount Histopathology.', 'Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Local Recurrence Reporting (PI-RR): International Consensus -based Guidelines on Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Prostate Cancer Recurrence after Radiation Therapy and Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Prediction of prostate cancer recurrence after radiation therapy using multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy: assessment of prognostic factors on pretreatment imaging.']"""

A score was used to assess awareness of cancer in general, and of prostate cancer, considering satisfactory knowledge a score of 6 points.  Results:   The mean age was 36.9 years (standard deviation of ±12.6) and 58.2% of participants were male. No previous contact with information related to prostate cancer was reported by 45.5% of participants. For these cases, a greater proportion was observed among men aged over 50 years. As to the score, the mean was 3.7 (standard deviation of ±1.3), with a positive correlation among higher scores, higher income and education level.

Purpose:   To accelerate prostate MRI exams, utilizing a variational network (VN) for image reconstruction.  Study type:   Retrospective.  Subjects:   One hundred and thirteen subjects (train/val/test: 70/13/30) undergoing prostate MRI.  Field strength/sequence:   3.0 T; a T2 turbo spin echo (TSE) T2-weighted image (T2WI) sequence in axial and coronal planes, and axial echo-planar diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI).  Assessment:   Four abdominal radiologists evaluated the image quality of VN reconstructions of retrospectively under-sampled biparametric MRIs (bp-MRI), and standard bp-MRI reconstructions for 20 test subjects (studies). The studies included axial and coronal T2WI, DWI B50 seconds/mm2 and B1000 seconds/mm (4-fold T2WI, 3-fold DWI), all of which were evaluated separately for image quality on a Likert scale (1: non-diagnostic to 5: excellent quality). In another 10 test subjects, three readers graded lesions on bp-MRI-which additionally included calculated B1500 seconds/mm2 , and apparent diffusion coefficient map-according to the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS v2.1), for both VN and standard reconstructions. Accuracy of PI-RADS ≥3 for clinically significant cancer was computed. Projected scan time of the retrospectively under-sampled biparametric exam was also computed.  Statistical tests:   One-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for comparison of image quality. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated for lesion detection and grading. Generalized estimating equation with cluster effect was used to compare differences between standard and VN bp-MRI. A P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Results:   Three of four readers rated no significant difference for overall quality between the standard and VN axial T2WI (Reader 1: 4.00 ± 0.56 (Standard), 3.90 ± 0.64 (VN) P = 0.33; Reader 2: 4.35 ± 0.74 (Standard), 3.80 ± 0.89 (VN) P = 0.003; Reader 3: 4.60 ± 0.50 (Standard), 4.55 ± 0.60 (VN) P = 0.39; Reader 4: 3.65 ± 0.99 (Standard), 3.60 ± 1.00 (VN) P = 0.38). All four readers rated no significant difference for overall quality between standard and VN DWI B1000 seconds/mm2 (Reader 1: 2.25 ± 0.62 (Standard), 2.45 ± 0.75 (VN) P = 0.96; Reader 2: 3.60 ± 0.92 (Standard), 3.55 ± 0.82 (VN) P = 0.40; Reader 3: 3.85 ± 0.72 (Standard), 3.55 ± 0.89 (VN) P = 0.07; Reader 4: 4.70 ± 0.76 (Standard); 4.60 ± 0.73 (VN) P = 0.17) and three of four readers rated no significant difference for overall quality between standard and VN DWI B50 seconds/mm2 (Reader 1: 3.20 ± 0.70 (Standard), 3.40 ± 0.75 (VN) P = 0.98; Reader 2: 2.85 ± 0.81 (Standard), 3.00 ± 0.79 (VN) P = 0.93; Reader 3: 4.45 ± 0.72 (Standard), 4.05 ± 0.69 (VN) P = 0.02; Reader 4: 4.50 ± 0.69 (Standard), 4.45 ± 0.76 (VN) P = 0.50). In the lesion evaluation study, there was no significant difference in the number of PI-RADS ≥3 lesions identified on standard vs. VN bp-MRI (P = 0.92, 0.59, 0.87) with similar sensitivity and specificity for clinically significant cancer. The average scan time of the standard clinical biparametric exam was 11.8 minutes, and this was projected to be 3.2 minutes for the accelerated exam.  Data conclusion:   Diagnostic accelerated biparametric prostate MRI exams can be performed using deep learning methods in <4 minutes, potentially enabling rapid screening prostate MRI.

Methods:   Based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, a signature constructed by DEirlncRNAs pairs was determined. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, Kaplan-Meier analysis, nomogram, and decision curve analysis were used to analyze it. Then, immunophenoscore (IPS), immune cell infiltration, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and immune function were investigated. Finally, we evaluated the role of the signature in medical treatment.  Results:   A signature constructed by 10 valid DEirlncRNAs pairs was identified in the training set and validated well in the testing and entire set. The signature was a reliable and independent prognostic indicator to predict the BCR of prostate cancer, which was better than the clinicopathological characteristics. After dividing the patients into low- and high-risk groups by median value, we found that the high-risk group had shorter BCR-free time and higher TMB levels. Furthermore, the high-risk group was negatively associated with plasma B cells and CD+8 T cells. IPS and immune functions, such as immune checkpoints and human leukocyte antigen, were significantly different between the two groups. Low-risk group was more sensitive to endocrine therapy and immunotherapy, while high-risk group was more inclined to targeted drugs. Both groups had their own sensitive chemotherapy.  Conclusion:   We established a novel signature to predict BCR and validated its role in the immune landscape of prostate cancer, which could help patients receive personalized medical treatment.""","""['Guian Zhang', 'Yong Luo']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Gen Med""","""['A cuproptosis-related LncRNA signature: Integrated analysis associated with biochemical recurrence and immune landscape in prostate cancer.', 'Development and validation of novel inflammatory response-related gene signature to predict prostate cancer recurrence and response to immune checkpoint therapy.', 'Identification and Validation of a Prognostic 5-Protein Signature for Biochemical Recurrence Following Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer.', 'A Novel Set of Immune-associated Gene Signature predicts Biochemical Recurrence in Localized Prostate Cancer Patients after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Identification of a DNA Repair Gene Signature and Establishment of a Prognostic Nomogram Predicting Biochemical-Recurrence-Free Survival of Prostate Cancer.']"""

During the COVID-19 pandemic, face-to-face consultations were reduced and so remote monitoring of these needs was necessary. University Hospitals Sussex implemented the routine use of electronic remote patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in a mixed oncology population, focusing on those with treatable but not curable cancers.  Materials and methods:   Over a 9-month period, patients were invited to register with My Clinical Outcomes (MCO) - a secure online platform for the collection of electronic PROMs. They were prompted by e-mail to complete assessments (EORTC QLQ-C30, EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D VAS) routinely every 2 weeks. The team monitored patient scores and changes in these prompted clinical interventions.  Results:   In total, 324 patients completed at least one assessment. The median number of assessments completed by each patient was eight. The most represented tumour groups were secondary breast (28%), prostate (25%) and other (32%). Median scores for the assessments did not deteriorate in a clinically or numerically significant way for patients living with non-curable conditions for the majority of patients monitored.  Conclusion:   Routine collection of electronic remote PROMs is an effective and useful strategy to provide real-time clinical feedback to teams. With integration into existing systems, online platforms (such as MCO) could provide efficient and patient-centred information for those providing care for people with cancer.""","""['E Stewart', 'S Tavabie', 'N White', 'S Appleyard', 'S Bass', 'D Gilbert', 'R Herriott', 'T Williams', 'G Wells', 'K Young', 'O Minton']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol)""","""['Mapping EORTC-QLQ-C30 to EQ-5D-3L in patients with colorectal cancer.', 'Patient-reported outcomes following enzalutamide or placebo in men with non-metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (PROSPER): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial.', 'Standardising the Assessment of Patient-reported Outcome Measures in Localised Prostate Cancer.

Material and methods:   This study included 144 patients treated with prostate stereotactic body radiation therapy after implantation in each of 4 gold fiducial markers (FMs), which were located and numbered consistently. The center of mass of the FMs was recorded for every pair of X-ray images taken during treatment. The distance between each pair of fiducials in the live X-ray images is calculated and compared with the respective distances as determined in the CT volume. The RBE is the difference between these distances. Mean RBE and intrafraction and interfraction RBE were evaluated. The intrafraction and intefraction RBE variability were defined as the standard deviation, respectively, of all RBE during 1 treatment fraction and of the mean daily RBE over the whole treatment course.  Results:   We analyzed 720 treatment fractions comprising 24,453 orthogonal X-ray image acquisitions. We observed a trend to higher RBE related to FM4 (apex) during treatment. The fiducial marker in the prostate apex could not be used in 16% of observations, in which RBE was > 2.5 mm. The mean RBEavg was 0.93 ± 0.39 mm (range 0.32-1.79 mm) over the 5 fractions. The RBEavg was significantly lower for the first and second fraction compared with the others (P < .001). The interfraction variability of RBEavg was 0.26 ± 0.16 mm (range 0.04-0.74 mm). The mean intrafraction variability of all FMs was 0.45 ± 0.25 mm. The highest Pearson correlation coefficient was observed between FM2 and FM3 (middle left and right prostate) (R = 0.78; P < .001). Every combination with FM4 yielded lower coefficients (range 0.66-0.71; P < .001), indicating different deformation of the prostate apex.  Conclusions:   Ideally, prostate deformation is generally small, but it is very sensitive to rectal and bladder filling. We observed RBE up to 11.3 mm. The overall correlation between FMs was affected by shifts of individual fiducials, indicating that the prostate is not a ""rigid"" organ.

It is, however, considered a ""contaminated"" procedure which may lead to infectious complications. Recent studies suggest a significant share of fluoroquinolone-resistant rectal flora in post-biopsy infections.  Methods:   The molecular mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance, including PMQR (plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance) as well as mutation in the QRDRs (quinolone-resistance determining regions) of gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE, among Enterobacterales isolated from 32 of 48 men undergoing a prostate biopsy between November 2015 and April 2016 were investigated. Before the TRUS-Bx procedure, all the patients received an oral antibiotic containing fluoroquinolones.  Results:   In total, 41 Enterobacterales isolates were obtained from rectal swabs. The MIC of ciprofloxacin and the presence of common PMQR determinants were investigated in all the isolates. Nine (21.9%) isolates carried PMQR with qnrS as the only PMQR agent detected. DNA sequencing of the QRDRs in 18 Enterobacterales (E. coli n = 17 and E. cloacae n = 1) isolates with ciprofloxacin MIC ≥ 0.25 mg/l were performed. Substitutions in the following codons were found: GyrA-83 [Ser → Leu, Phe] and 87 [Asp → Asn]; GyrB codon-605 [Met → Leu], ParC codons-80 [Ser → Ile, Arg] and 84 [Glu → Gly, Met, Val, Lys], ParE codons-458 [Ser → Ala], 461 [Glu → Ala] and 512 [Ala → Thr]. Six isolates with ciprofloxacin MIC ≥ 2 mg/l had at least one mutation in GyrA together with qnrS.  Conclusions:   This study provides information on the common presence of PMQRs among Enterobacterales isolates with ciprofloxacin MIC ≥ 0.25 mg/l, obtained from men undergoing TRUS-Bx. This fact may partially explain why some men develop post-TRUS-Bx infections despite ciprofloxacin prophylaxis.""","""['Katarzyna Piekarska', 'Katarzyna Zacharczuk', 'Tomasz Wołkowicz', 'Mateusz Mokrzyś', 'Natalia Wolaniuk', 'Magdalena Nowakowska', 'Stanisław Szempliński', 'Jakub Dobruch', 'Rafał Gierczyński']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob""","""['Prevalence of Plasmid-Mediated Quinolone Resistance (PMQRs) Determinants and Whole Genome Sequence Screening of PMQR-Producing E. coli Isolated from Men Undergoing a Transrectal Prostate Biopsy.', 'Co-existence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants and mutations in gyrA and parC among fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolated in a tertiary hospital in Warsaw, Poland.', 'Impact of co-existence of PMQR genes and QRDR mutations on fluoroquinolones resistance in Enterobacteriaceae strains isolated from community and hospital acquired UTIs.', 'Infectious complications following prostate biopsy-Major changes 2020.', 'Prostate biopsy-infection prophylaxis and patient preparation.', 'Synthesis and antibacterial activity evaluation of N (7) position-modified balofloxacins.', 'Prevalence of Plasmid-Mediated Quinolone Resistance (PMQRs) Determinants and Whole Genome Sequence Screening of PMQR-Producing E. coli Isolated from Men Undergoing a Transrectal Prostate Biopsy.']"""

Results:   Of 22 centres, 19 (86%) responded. In total, 4233 adult patients are currently treated across Europe annually, of which 46% consists of patients with central nervous system tumours (CNS), 15% head and neck cancer (HNC), 15% prostate, 9% breast, 5% lung, 5% gastrointestinal, 4% lymphoma, 0.3% gynaecological cancers. CNS are treated in all participating centres (n = 19) using PT, HNC in 16 centres, lymphoma in 10 centres, gastrointestinal in 10 centres, breast in 7 centres, prostate in 6 centres, lung in 6 centres, and gynaecological cancers in 3 centres. Reimbursement is provided by national health care systems for the majority of commonly treated tumour sites. Approximately 74% of centres enrol patients for prospective data registration programs. Phase II-III trials are less frequent, due to reimbursement and funding problems. Reasons for not treating certain tumour types with PT are lack of evidence (30%), reimbursement issues (29%) and/or technical limitations (20%).

CT lung screening can reduce lung cancer mortality through early diagnosis by at least 20%. Screening high-risk individuals is most effective. Retrospective analyses suggest that identifying individuals for screening by accurate prediction models is more efficient than using categorical age-smoking criteria, such as the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) criteria. This study prospectively compared the effectiveness of the USPSTF2013 and PLCOm2012 model eligibility criteria.  Methods:   In this prospective cohort study, participants from the International Lung Screening Trial (ILST), aged 55-80 years, who were current or former smokers (ie, had ≥30 pack-years smoking history or ≤15 quit-years since last permanently quitting), and who met USPSTF2013 criteria or a PLCOm2012 risk threshold of at least 1·51% within 6 years of screening, were recruited from nine screening sites in Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, and the UK. After enrolment, patients were assessed with the USPSTF2013 criteria and the PLCOm2012 risk model with a threshold of at least 1·70% at 6 years. Data were collected locally and centralised. Main outcomes were the comparison of lung cancer detection rates and cumulative life expectancies in patients with lung cancer between USPSTF2013 criteria and the PLCOm2012 model. In this Article, we present data from an interim analysis. To estimate the incidence of lung cancers in individuals who were USPSTF2013-negative and had PLCOm2012 of less than 1·51% at 6 years, ever-smokers in the Prostate Lung Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) who met these criteria and their lung cancer incidence were applied to the ILST sample size for the mean follow-up occurring in the ILST. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02871856. Study enrolment is almost complete.  Findings:   Between June 17, 2015, and Dec 29, 2020, 5819 participants from the International Lung Screening Trial (ILST) were enrolled on the basis of meeting USPSTF2013 criteria or the PLCOm2012 risk threshold of at least 1·51% at 6 years. The same number of individuals was selected for the PLCOm2012 model as for the USPSTF2013 criteria (4540 [78%] of 5819). After a mean follow-up of 2·3 years (SD 1·0), 135 lung cancers occurred in 4540 USPSTF2013-positive participants and 162 in 4540 participants included in the PLCOm2012 of at least 1·70% at 6 years group (cancer sensitivity difference 15·8%, 95% CI 10·7-22·1%; absolute odds ratio 4·00, 95% CI 1·89-9·44; p<0·0001). Compared to USPSTF2013-positive individuals, PLCOm2012-selected participants were older (mean age 65·7 years [SD 5·9] vs 63·3 years [5·7]; p<0·0001), had more comorbidities (median 2 [IQR 1-3] vs 1 [1-2]; p<0·0001), and shorter life expectancy (13·9 years [95% CI 12·8-14·9] vs 14·8 [13·6-16·0] years).

Methods:   A U-Net CNN was trained and tested for 3D prostate segmentation in computed tomography (CT) images. To improve the segmentation accuracy, the CNN's input images were annotated with a set of border landmarks to supervise the network for segmenting the prostate. The network was trained and tested again with annotated images after 5, 10, 15, 20, or 30 landmark points were used.  Results:   Compared to fully automatic segmentation, the Dice similarity coefficient increased up to 9% when 5-30 sparse landmark points were involved, with the segmentation accuracy improving as more border landmarks were used.

However, the long-term clinical implications of PSMA PET/CT upstaging remain unclear.  Objectives:   To evaluate the prognostic significance of a nomogram that models an individual's risk of nonlocalized upstaging on PSMA PET/CT and to compare its performance with existing risk-stratification tools.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cohort study included patients diagnosed with high-risk or very high-risk prostate cancer (ie, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] level >20 ng/mL, Gleason score 8-10, and/or clinical stage T3-T4, without evidence of nodal or metastatic disease by conventional workup) from April 1995 to August 2018. This multinational study was conducted at 15 centers. Data were analyzed from December 2020 to March 2021.  Exposures:   Curative-intent radical prostatectomy (RP), external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), or EBRT plus brachytherapy (BT), with or without androgen deprivation therapy.  Main outcomes and measures:   PSMA upstage probability was calculated from a nomogram using the biopsy Gleason score, percentage positive systematic biopsy cores, clinical T category, and PSA level. Biochemical recurrence (BCR), distant metastasis (DM), prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), and overall survival (OS) were analyzed using Fine-Gray and Cox regressions. Model performance was quantified with the concordance (C) index.  Results:   Of 5275 patients, the median (IQR) age was 66 (60-72) years; 2883 (55%) were treated with RP, 1669 (32%) with EBRT, and 723 (14%) with EBRT plus BT; median (IQR) PSA level was 10.5 (5.9-23.2) ng/mL; 3987 (76%) had Gleason grade 8 to 10 disease; and 750 (14%) had stage T3 to T4 disease. Median (IQR) follow-up was 5.1 (3.1-7.9) years; 1221 (23%) were followed up for at least 8 years. Overall, 1895 (36%) had BCR, 851 (16%) developed DM, and 242 (5%) died of prostate cancer. PSMA upstage probability was significantly prognostic of all clinical end points, with 8-year C indices of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.61-0.65) for BCR, 0.69 (95% CI, 0.66-0.71) for DM, 0.71 (95% CI, 0.67-0.75) for PCSM, and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.57-0.62) for PCSM (P < .001). The PSMA nomogram outperformed existing risk-stratification tools, except for similar performance to Staging Collaboration for Cancer of the Prostate (STAR-CAP) for PCSM (eg, DM: PSMA, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.66-0.71] vs STAR-CAP, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.62-0.68]; P < .001; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center nomogram, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.54-0.60]; P < .001; Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment groups, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.51-0.56]; P < .001). Results were validated in secondary cohorts from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database and the National Cancer Database.  Conclusions and relevance:   These findings suggest that PSMA upstage probability is associated with long-term, clinically meaningful end points. Furthermore, PSMA upstaging had superior risk discrimination compared with existing tools. Formerly occult, PSMA PET/CT-detectable nonlocalized disease may be the main driver of outcomes in high-risk patients.""","""['Michael Xiang', 'Ting Martin Ma', 'Ricky Savjani', 'Erqi L Pollom', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Tristan Grogan', 'Jessica K Wong', 'Giovanni Motterle', 'Jeffrey J Tosoian', 'Bruce J Trock', 'Eric A Klein', 'Bradley J Stish', 'Robert T Dess', 'Daniel E Spratt', 'Avinash Pilar', 'Chandana Reddy', 'Rebecca Levin-Epstein', 'Trude B Wedde', 'Wolfgang A Lilleby', 'Ryan Fiano', 'Gregory S Merrick', 'Richard G Stock', 'D Jeffrey Demanes', 'Brian J Moran', 'Hartwig Huland', 'Phuoc T Tran', 'Santiago Martin', 'Rafael Martinez-Monge', 'Daniel J Krauss', 'Eyad I Abu-Isa', 'Ridwan Alam', 'Zeyad Schwen', 'Thomas M Pisansky', 'C Richard Choo', 'Daniel Y Song', 'Stephen Greco', 'Curtiland Deville', 'Todd McNutt', 'Theodore L DeWeese', 'Ashley E Ross', 'Jay P Ciezki', 'Paul C Boutros', 'Nicholas G Nickols', 'Prashant Bhat', 'David Shabsovich', 'Jesus E Juarez', 'Natalie Chong', 'Patrick A Kupelian', 'Matthew B Rettig', 'Nicholas G Zaorsky', 'Alejandro Berlin', 'Jonathan D Tward', 'Brian J Davis', 'Robert E Reiter', 'Michael L Steinberg', 'David Elashoff', 'Eric M Horwitz', 'Rahul D Tendulkar', 'Derya Tilki', 'Johannes Czernin', 'Andrei Gafita', 'Tahmineh Romero', 'Jeremie Calais', 'Amar U Kishan']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['68Ga-Labeled Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Ligand Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'A prospective randomized multicentre study of the impact of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT imaging for staging high-risk prostate cancer prior to curative-intent surgery or radiotherapy (proPSMA study): clinical trial protocol.', 'Efficacy, Predictive Factors, and Prediction Nomograms for 68Ga-labeled Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-ligand Positron-emission Tomography/Computed Tomography in Early Biochemical Recurrent Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Bridging the Imaging Gap: PSMA PET/CT Has a High Impact on Treatment Planning in Prostate Cancer Patients with Biochemical Recurrence-A Narrative Review of the Literature.', 'Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) ligands for diagnosis and therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Development and validation of a clinic machine-learning nomogram for the prediction of risk stratifications of prostate cancer based on functional subsets of peripheral lymphocyte.', 'Management of Patients with Advanced Prostate Cancer.

Gallium-68-prostate-specific membrane antigen-11 (68Ga-PSMA-11) targeting PSMA has been at the forefront of imaging in biochemical recurrence however the emergence of fluorine-18 (18F)-PSMA-1007 may prove to be advantageous over the 68Ga-PSMA-11 molecule due to its physical and physiologic al attributes. The aim of our study was to assess the diagnostic performance of 18F-PSMA-1007 as compared to that of 68Ga-PSMA-11 in the same patients who presented with biochemical recurrence.  Material and methods:   Twenty-one patients with biochemical recurrence prostate cancer were prospectively enrolled into the study. Fluorine-18-PSMA-1007 positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) was performed on the same patient after 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT had been performed. Recurrence diagnosed on each of these studies was compared against a final diagnosis based on clinical follow-up and histological correlation where available.  Results:   Gallium-68-PSMA-11 identified fifteen (71,4%) patients as being negative for recurrence whilst five (23.8%) were identified as positive and one (4.8%) as uncertain. In comparison 18F-PSMA-1007 identified eight (38.1%) as being positive with thirteen (61.9%) patients' scans identified as negative for recurrence. No scans were classified as uncertain for the 18F-PSMA-1007 group. Fluorine-18-PSMA-1007 identified 8 lesions as positive for disease recurrence whilst only 6 lesions were identified on 68Ga-PSMA-11. Of the 8 patients identified as having recurrence on 18F-PSMA-1007 4 of those demonstrated local prostatic recurrence. The rest demonstrated local nodal recurrence and skeletal metastases. Fluorine-18-PSMA-1007 demonstrated a sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of 88.9%, 100%, 100%, and 92.3% respectively whilst 68Ga-PSMA-11 demonstrated a sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of 44.4%, 83.3%, 80%, and 66.6%, respectively.

However, training these models relies heavily on a large number of samples manually annotated by experts, which is cumbersome and expensive. In addition, it is difficult to obtain a perfect set of labels due to the variability between expert annotations. This paper presents a novel active learning (AL) framework for histopathology image analysis, named PathAL. To reduce the required number of expert annotations, PathAL selects two groups of unlabeled data in each training iteration: one ""informative"" sample that requires additional expert annotation, and one ""confident predictive"" sample that is automatically added to the training set using the model's pseudo-labels. To reduce the impact of the noisy-labeled samples in the training set, PathAL systematically identifies noisy samples and excludes them to improve the generalization of the model. Our model advances the existing AL method for medical image analysis in two ways. First, we present a selection strategy to improve classification performance with fewer manual annotations. Unlike traditional methods focusing only on finding the most uncertain samples with low prediction confidence, we discover a large number of high confidence samples from the unlabeled set and automatically add them for training with assigned pseudo-labels. Second, we design a method to distinguish between noisy samples and hard samples using a heuristic approach. We exclude the noisy samples while preserving the hard samples to improve model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed PathAL framework achieves promising results on a prostate cancer Gleason grading task, obtaining similar performance with 40% fewer annotations compared to the fully supervised learning scenario. An ablation study is provided to analyze the effectiveness of each component in PathAL, and a pathologist reader study is conducted to validate our proposed algorithm.""","""['Wenyuan Li', 'Jiayun Li', 'Zichen Wang', 'Jennifer Polson', 'Anthony E Sisk', 'Dipti P Sajed', 'William Speier', 'Corey W Arnold']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Med Imaging""","""['Semi-supervised training of deep convolutional neural networks with heterogeneous data and few local annotations: An experiment on prostate histopathology image classification.', 'Combining weakly and strongly supervised learning improves strong supervision in Gleason pattern classification.', 'S-CUDA: Self-cleansing unsupervised domain adaptation for medical image segmentation.', 'Graph temporal ensembling based semi-supervised convolutional neural network with noisy labels for histopathology image analysis.', 'Learning to segment subcortical structures from noisy annotations with a novel uncertainty-reliability aware learning framework.', 'Inference of core needle biopsy whole slide images requiring definitive therapy for prostate cancer.']"""

WGCNA was conducted to identify lncRNAs that were significantly correlated with patient overall survival (OS) and HNSCC tumor. RT-qPCR was employed to validate the expression of lncRNAs in HNSCC cell lines and patient sera. A ceRNA network consisting of 90 DEGs, 7 DEMs and 67 DELs associated with clinical traits was established. WGCNA and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that 5 DELs (MIR4435-2 HG, CASC9, LINC01980, STARD4-AS1 and MIR99AHG) were significantly correlated with OS of HNSCC patients, whereas DEL PART1 was most significantly correlated with the HNSCC tumor. The in silico predicted expression patterns of PART1, LINC01980 and MIR4435-2 HG were further validated in HNSCC cell lines and patient sera. Collectively, the present study provided novel insights into the lncRNA-regulated ceRNA networks in HNSCC and identified novel lncRNAs that harbor diagnostic and prognostic potentials for HNSCC.Abbreviations BP, biological process.

In the past, numerous research groups investigated the omics profiles of patients and scrutinized biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of PCa. However, information related to the biomarkers is widely scattered across numerous resources in complex textual format, which poses hindrance to understand the tumorigenesis of this malignancy and scrutinization of robust signature. To create a comprehensive resource, we collected all the relevant literature on PCa biomarkers from the PubMed. We scrutinize the extensive information about each biomarker from a total of 412 unique research articles. Each entry of the database incorporates PubMed ID, biomarker name, biomarker type, biomolecule, source, subjects, validation status, and performance measures such as sensitivity, specificity, and hazard ratio (HR). In this study, we present ProCanBio, a manually curated database that maintains detailed data on 2053 entries of potential PCa biomarkers obtained from 412 publications in user-friendly tabular format. Among them are 766 protein-based, 507 RNA-based, 157 genomic mutations, 260 miRNA-based, and 122 metabolites-based biomarkers. To explore the information in the resource, a web-based interactive platform was developed with searching and browsing facilities. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no resource that can consolidate the information contained in all the published literature. Besides this, ProCanBio is freely available and is compatible with most web browsers and devices.

Methods:   This was a single-center retrospective analysis of 4994 cancer patients who underwent tissue or blood genomic profiling, including CDK12 assessment, conducted as part of routine care from December 2012 to January 2020. Prevalence, clinical characteristics, and treatment outcomes of patients with tumors with pathogenic CDK12 alterations were described.  Results:   In all, 39 (0.78%, n = 39/4994) patients had pathogenic CDK12 alterations. Among CDK12-altered tumors, the most common organ site was prostate (n = 9, 23.1%) followed by colorectal (n = 5, 12.8%). Adenocarcinoma was the most common histology (n = 26, 66.7%). Median follow-up from time of diagnosis was 4.02 years. Median overall survival from time of metastasis was 4.43 years (95% CI: 3.11-5.74). Ten patients with CDK12-altered tumors received at least one immune checkpoint inhibitor-containing regimen. The majority of patients (n = 6/10, 60%) experienced an objective response. Progression-free survival for patients who had metastatic disease and received a checkpoint inhibitor-containing regimen was 1.16 years (95% CI: 0.32-2.00).

Accumulating evidence showed that certain E3 ubiquitin ligases such as SIAH2, RNF7, and SPOP play important roles in PC development and progression. However, the roles and mechanisms of other E3s in PC progression remain largely unexplored. Through an integration analysis of clinical genomic and transcriptomic profiles of PC tumors, this study identified UBR5 as a top PC-relevant E3 ubiquitin ligase whose expression levels are strongly associated with PC progression and aggressiveness. BoxCar and shotgun proteomic analyses of control and UBR5-knockdown PC3 cells complementarily identified 75 UBR5-regulated proteins. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that the 75 proteins form four molecular networks centered around FANCD2, PAF1, YY1, and LAMB3 via direct protein-protein interactions. Experimental analyses demonstrated that UBR5 associates with and downregulates two key DNA damage repair proteins (XRCC3 and FANCD2) and confers PC cell sensitivity to olaparib, a PARP inhibitor in clinical use for cancer therapy. This study represents the first application of BoxCar in PC research, provides new insights into the molecular functions of UBR5 in PC, and suggests that PC patients with UBR5-high tumors may potentially benefit from PARP inhibitor treatment.""","""['Yiwu Yan', 'Bo Zhou', 'Yeon-Joo Lee', 'Sungyong You', 'Michael R Freeman', 'Wei Yang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Proteomics""","""['Modulation of myocardin function by the ubiquitin E3 ligase UBR5.', 'Downregulation of the proapoptotic protein MOAP-1 by the UBR5 ubiquitin ligase and its role in ovarian cancer resistance to cisplatin.', 'Functional Roles of the E3 Ubiquitin Ligase UBR5 in Cancer.', 'UBR5 is a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in skeletal muscle hypertrophy and recovery from atrophy.', 'VprBP (DCAF1): a promiscuous substrate recognition subunit that incorporates into both RING-family CRL4 and HECT-family EDD/UBR5 E3 ubiquitin ligases.', 'Comparative proteomic profiling of uric acid, ammonium acid urate, and calcium-based kidney stones.']"""

While research is uncovering valuable individual experiences of those living with and beyond cancer, it has been argued that this idiographic approach is limited in outlook, reach and impact. This study contributes to the understanding of what it means to live with and beyond cancer by complementing idiographic knowledge with multiple perspectives from a group of participants who are living with and beyond cancer, to explore how individual experiences may be relevant to others.  Method:   Semi-structured interviews were conducted with people who had received treatment for breast (n = 6), prostate (n = 6) or colorectal cancer (n = 6). Data were analysed using interpretive phenomenological analysis. The early findings were then shared with a wider group of people who had received treatment for breast, prostate or colorectal cancer (n = 26) in six focus groups, to explore whether they had similar experiences.  Results:   While individual accounts of living with and beyond cancer detail unique features specific to each person's experience, focus group discussions illustrated how participant life worlds interact and overlap. The findings identified thematic similarities within and between individual and group levels and across cancer types. Three super-ordinate themes describe the shared experience of living with and beyond cancer: i) the cancer shock, ii) managing cancer and getting through and iii) getting over cancer.

Understanding microstructural changes in both white matter and subcortical regions may aid our understanding of how individual differences in these behaviors emerge. Restriction spectrum imaging (RSI) is a framework for modelling diffusion-weighted imaging that decomposes the diffusion signal from a voxel into hindered, restricted, and free compartments. This yields greater specificity than conventional methods of characterizing diffusion. Using RSI, we quantified voxelwise restricted diffusion across the brain and measured age associations in a large sample (n = 8086) from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study aged 9-14 years. Older participants showed a higher restricted signal fraction across the brain, with the largest associations in subcortical regions, particularly the basal ganglia and ventral diencephalon. Importantly, age associations varied with respect to the cytoarchitecture within white matter fiber tracts and subcortical structures, for example age associations differed across thalamic nuclei. This suggests that age-related changes may map onto specific cell populations or circuits and highlights the utility of voxelwise compared to ROI-wise analyses.

However, drug resistance often develops and leads to treatment failure in a variety of prostate cancer patients. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the sensitivity of prostate cancer to chemotherapy. Lovastatin (LV) is a natural compound extracted from Monascus-fermented foods and is an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), which has been approved by the FDA for hyperlipidemia treatment. We have previously found that LV could inhibit the proliferation of refractory cancer cells. Up to now, the effect of LV on chemosensitization and the mechanisms involved have not been evaluated in drug-resistant prostate cancer. In this study, we used prostate cancer cell line PC3 and its paclitaxel-resistant counterpart PC3-TxR as the cell model. Alamar Blue cell viability assay showed that LV and paclitaxel each conferred concentration-dependent inhibition of PC3-TxR cells. When paclitaxel was combined with LV, the proliferation of PC3-TxR cells was synergistically inhibited, as demonstrated by combination index <1. Moreover, colony formation decreased while apoptosis increased in paclitaxel plus LV group compared with paclitaxel alone group. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that the combination of paclitaxel and LV could significantly reduce the expression of CYP2C8, an important drug-metabolizing enzyme. Bioinformatics analysis from the TCGA database showed that CYP2C8 expression was negatively correlated with progression-free survival (PFS) in prostate cancer patients. Our results suggest that LV might increase the sensitivity of resistant prostate cancer cells to paclitaxel through inhibition of CYP2C8 and could be utilized as a chemosensitizer for paclitaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells.""","""['Ying Li', 'Sisi Chen', 'Jianyu Zhu', 'Chanjuan Zheng', 'Muyao Wu', 'Lian Xue', 'Guangchun He', 'Shujun Fu', 'Xiyun Deng']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Knockdown of lncRNA CCAT1 enhances sensitivity of paclitaxel in prostate cancer via regulating miR-24-3p and FSCN1.', 'Down-regulation of E-cadherin enhances prostate cancer chemoresistance via Notch signaling.', 'Skp2 is associated with paclitaxel resistance in prostate cancer cells.', 'Chemoresistance in prostate cancer cells is regulated by miRNAs and Hedgehog pathway.', 'Paclitaxel and docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer: Molecular mechanisms and possible therapeutic strategies.', 'A Cross-Talk about Radioresistance in Lung Cancer-How to Improve Radiosensitivity According to Chinese Medicine and Medicaments That Commonly Occur in Pharmacies.', 'Inhibitory effect of lovastatin on human lung cancer cell proliferation by regulating the ERK1/2 and COX-2 pathways.']"""

Improvement of patient outcomes requires better understanding of links between BCG resistance and genomic driver alterations.  Objective:   To validate the prognostic impact of common genomic alterations in NMIBC pretreatment and define somatic changes present in post-BCG relapses.  Design, setting, and participants:   We retrieved tumour tissues and outcomes for 90 patients with BCG-naive NMIBC initiating BCG monotherapy. Post-BCG tissue was available from 34 patients. All tissues underwent targeted sequencing of tumour and matched normal.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Associations between clinical outcomes and genomics were determined using Cox proportional hazard models.  Results and limitations:   Of the patients, 58% were relapse free at data cut-off, 24% had NMIBC recurrence, and 18% experienced muscle-invasive progression. The risk of relapse was associated with ARID1A mutation (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.00; p = 0.04) and CCNE1 amplification (HR = 2.61; p = 0.02). Pre- and post-BCG tumours shared truncal driver alterations, with mutations in TERT and chromatin remodelling genes particularly conserved. However, shifts in somatic profiles were common and clinically relevant alterations in FGFR3, PIK3CA, TSC1, and TP53 were temporally variable, despite apparent clonal prevalence at one time point. Limitations include the difficulty of resolving the relative impact of BCG therapy versus surgery on genomics at relapse and biopsy bias.  Conclusions:   Somatic hypermutation and alterations in CCNE1 and ARID1A should be incorporated into future models predicting NMIBC BCG outcomes. Changes in tumour genomics over time highlight the importance of recent biopsy when considering targeted therapies, and suggest that relapse after BCG is due to persisting and evolving precursor populations.  Patient summary:   Changes in key cancer genes can predict bladder cancer relapse after treatment with bacillus Calmette-Guérin. Relapses after treatment can be driven by large-scale genetic changes within the cancer.

Methods:   Fifty-one patients with low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer underwent low-dose-rate FB. Survival rates free from biochemical failure (BF), additional treatment (AT) including re-FB, and whole-gland or systemic salvage therapy (ST) were calculated and oncological risk factors were investigated. Patient-reported outcomes on genitourinary function were also assessed. Using propensity scoring, 51 pair-matched RP patients were selected. Oncological control, urinary continence, and ejaculation status after FB and RP were compared.  Results:   During a median 5.7-year follow-up, BF, AT, and ST occurred in 12 (24%), 10 (20%), and 4 FB patients (8%), respectively. 6 of 10 AT patients were managed with re-FB alone. In the RP cohort, 3 patients (6%) underwent ST. 5-year BF-free survival rate after FB was 79%. Compared to 5-year ST-free survival rate of 94% after RP, ST-free and AT-free survival rates after FB were 93% (P = 0.813) and 87% (P = 0.049), respectively. Multivariate analyses of FB-treated patients showed that time to PSA nadir was negatively associated with BF and AT (hazard ratio 0.84 and 0.83, respectively, P <0.001 for each). The difference in oncological outcomes between low- and intermediate-risk categories was not significant. At 2 years after FB and RP, pad-free continence rates were 100% and 81%, respectively (P = 0.001). Ejaculation was preserved in 67% and 0% of patients who had been capable of ejaculation at baseline, respectively (P <0.001).  Conclusion:   In low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer, FB-treated patients achieved superior genitourinary function compared to pair-matched RP patients.

Correlation, reliability, and agreement between PUS, TRUS, and MRI were calculated through the Pearson coefficient, intraclass correlation coefficient, and Bland-Altman analysis, respectively. Data was stratified by prostate size, body mass index, and time between imaging acquisition.  Results:   A total of 91 patients underwent all three imaging methods. Median age was 64, median body mass index (BMI) was 27 kg/m2, and median PSA value prior to PUS was 7.1 ng/mL. Pearson coefficient for MRI versus TRUS and MRI versus PUS was 0.90 and 0.87, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.90 (0.87-0.93) comparing all three modalities. BA analysis for MRI versus TRUS and MRI versus PUS showed that for prostates ≤ 50 cc, greater than 79% of the data fell within limits of agreement. Percentages decreased with increasing prostate size to 46% and 41% for prostates > 50 cc and ≤ 80 cc and to 28% and 25% for prostates > 80 cc for MRI versus TRUS and MRI versus PUS, respectively.

Using CCK-8 and Transwell assays, the function of miR-1255b-5p on prostate cancer cells was investigated. The levels of miR-1255b-5p were significantly raised in prostate cancer patients when compared with BPH participants. MiR-1255b-5p level can distinguish prostate cancer patients from BPH or indolent type from aggressive type. Downregulation of miR-1255b-5p can suppress the proliferative, invasive, and migratory capacity, but this effect can be eradicated by EPB41L1 inhibition.

Main methods and major results:   Here, a versatile dinucleotide-tag reporter system (DiR) that enables parallel analysis of regulatory elements with minimized bias based on next-generation sequencing is described. The DiR system is more robust than the classical luciferase assay method, particularly for the investigation of moderate-level regulatory elements. The authors applied the DiR-seq assay in the functional evaluation of SNPs with prostate cancer risk and nominated two and six regulatory SNPs in PC-3 and LNCaP cells, respectively.

We evaluated the impact of PSA screening, alongside primary care provider utilization, on prostate cancer outcomes for these patients.  Methods:   We identified African American men aged 40-55 years, diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2004 and 2017 within the Veterans Health Administration. Inverse probability of treatment-weighted propensity scores were used in multivariable models to assess PSA screening on PSA levels higher than 20, Gleason score of 8 or higher, and metastatic disease at diagnosis. Lead-time adjusted Fine-Gray regression evaluated PSA screening on prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), with noncancer death as competing events. All statistical tests were 2-sided.  Results:   The cohort included 4726 patients. Mean age was 51.8 years, with 84-month median follow-up. There were 1057 (22.4%) with no PSA screening prior to diagnosis. Compared with no screening, PSA screening was associated with statistically significantly reduced odds of PSA levels higher than 20 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.49 to 0.63; P < .001), Gleason score of 8 or higher (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.69 to 0.88; P < .001), and metastatic disease at diagnosis (OR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.39 to 0.64; P < .001), and decreased PCSM (subdistribution hazard ratio = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.36 to 0.76; P < .001). Primary care provider visits displayed similar effects.  Conclusions:   Among young African American men diagnosed with prostate cancer, PSA screening was associated with statistically significantly lower risk of PSA levels higher than 20, Gleason score of 8 or higher, and metastatic disease at diagnosis and statistically significantly reduced risk of PCSM.

Methods:   ONCOMINE, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), Kaplan-Meier plotter, cBioPortal, GeneMANIA, and TIMER were used for analyzing differential expression, prognostic value, protein-protein interaction, genetic alteration and immune cell infiltration of CC chemokines in BC patients based on bioinformatics.  Results:   The results showed that transcriptional levels of CCL2/3/4/5/14/19/21/23 in BC patients were significantly reduced. A significant relation was observed between the expression of CCL2/11/14/18/19/21/23/24/26 and the pathological stage of BC patients. BC patients with high expression levels of CCL1, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL8, CCL13, CCL15, CCL17, CCL18, CCL19, CCL22, CCL25, CCL27 were associated with a significantly better prognosis. Moreover, we found that differentially expressed CC chemokines are primarily correlated with cytokine activity, chemokines receptor binding, chemotaxis, immune cell migration. Further, there were significant correlations among the expression of CC chemokines and the infiltration of several types of immune cells (B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells).

However, the treatment effect of 177Lu-PSMA-ligands is still suboptimal for a significant fraction of patients. In contrast to external beam radiotherapy, the radiation dose distribution itself is strongly influenced by the heterogeneous tumour microenvironment. Although microdosimetry is critical for RLT treatment outcome, it is difficult to clinically or experimentally establish the quantitative relation. We propose an in silico approach to quantitatively investigate the microdosimetry and its influence on treatment outcome for PSMA-directed RLT of two different radioisotopes 177Lu and 225 Ac. The ultimate goal is optimize the combined 177 Lu and 225 Ac-PSMA therapy and maximize the anti-tumour effect, while minimizing irradiation of off-target tissues.Clinical relevance- With the proposed hybrid model we show that 177Lu-PSMA-ligands treatment assures a more homogeneously distributed dose and a lower dependency of the treatment outcome on the domain vascularisation. On the other hand, the 225Ac-PSMA-ligands treatment shows a much stronger efficacy in killing tumor cells with an equivalent mean dose distribution even in an hypoxic environment.""","""['Gabriele Birindelli', 'Milos Drobnjakovic', 'Volker Morath', 'Katja Steiger', ""Calogero D'Alessandria"", 'Eleni Gourni', 'Ali Afshar-Oromieh', 'Wolfgang Weber', 'Axel Rominger', 'Matthias Eiber', 'Kuangyu Shi']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc""","""['Activity and Adverse Events of Actinium-225-PSMA-617 in Advanced Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer After Failure of Lutetium-177-PSMA.', 'In vitro dose effect relationships of actinium-225- and lutetium-177-labeled PSMA-I&T.', '177 Lu-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: Initial 254-patient results from a prospective registry (REALITY Study).', 'Third-line treatment and 177Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'PSMA radioligand therapy in patients with advanced prostate cancer.']"""

In this study, 108 PCas were collected from two different centers and were divided into training, testing, and validation set. From Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) map and T2-Weighted Image (T2WI), we extracted texture features, both 3D and 2D, and we implemented three different methods of Feature Selection (FS): Minimum Redundance Maximum Relevance (MRMR), Affinity Propagation (AP), and Genetic Algorithm (GA). From the resulting subsets of predictors, we trained Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Ensemble Learning classifiers on the training set, and we evaluated their prediction ability on the testing set. Then, for each FS method, we chose the best classifier, based on both training and testing performances, and we further assessed their generalization capability on the validation set. Between the three best models, a Decision Tree was trained using only two features extracted from the ADC map and selected by MRMR, achieving, on the validation set, an Area Under the ROC (AUC) equal to 81%, with sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 93%, respectively.Clinical Relevance- Our best model demonstrated to be able to distinguish low-aggressive from high-aggressive PCas with high accuracy.

Such limitation on models may be attributed to the relatively few labels to train the representation, as well as, to the natural imbalanced sets, available in clinical scenarios. To overcome such limitation, this work introduces a new embedding representation that learns intra and inter-Gleason relationships from more challenging class samples (grades tree and fourth). The proposed strategy implements a triplet loss scheme building a hidden embedding space that correctly differentiates close Gleason levels.

For MR-TRUS alignment during live procedure, the efficiency of the algorithm and accuracy plays an important role. In this paper, we have designed a comprehensive framework for fusion based biopsy using an end-to-end deep learning network for performing both rigid and deformation correction. Both rigid and deformation correction in one single network helps in reducing the computation time required for live TRUS-MR alignment. We have used 6500 images from 34 subjects for conducting this study. Our proposed registration pipeline provides Target Registration Error (TRE) of 2.51 mm after rigid and deformation correction on unseen patient dataset. In addition, with a total computation time of 70ms, we are able to achieve a rendering rate of 14 frames per second (FPS) that makes our network well suited for live procedures.Clinical Relevance- It is shown in the literature that systematic biopsy is the standard method for biopsy sampling in prostate that has high false negative rates.

Therefore, to make palpation objective and minimize variability in prostate cancer diagnosis among physicians, an automated palpation system is required. This paper describes the design and experimental evaluation of a 2 Degrees of Freedom (2DoF) tendon driven robotic palpation probe. The probe's palpation motion is controlled by actuating driving tendons using a cable-differential pulley transmission system and a return spring. A kinematic model of the robotic probe was derived. Furthermore, a tendon path length model was geometrically determined, and an optimization method for guide arc center placement to minimize change in tendon length was presented. Preliminary experimental and theoretical results were compared to determine the positioning accuracy. The difference between theoretical pitch angles [0°,80°] and measured values for the yaw angle range of [0°, 40°] was found to be in the range of 0.03° ~ 5.06°.Clinical Relevance- Diagnosis based on manual palpation is often subjective and palpation sensitivity depends on the physician's level of experience and skill.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, and black men are at the highest risk. Despite this, black men are the least likely to be diagnosed early with prostate cancer. It is important to understand why this is so that these men can receive early access to effective treatment and support.  Methods:   A constructivist grounded theory methodology was used. Data were collected between December 2015 and October 2017; seventeen men were interviewed, and eighteen men took part in focus groups.  Results:   There were differences in the way the men constructed their understanding of risks for prostate cancer. The social construction of prostate cancer risk knowledge was mediated by the way the men were socialised to understand and accept this risk. The Somali and African Caribbean men placed social importance on the healthy body, whereas the white working class men seemed to find social value through the unwell body. This research proposes the theory that social constructions of knowledge mediate the way men perceive and accept their risk for prostate cancer.  Conclusion:   Understanding socially-derived knowledge of risk may mediate the acceptance of factors relating to prostate cancer.

Crude cancer incidence rates were 112.2, 69.8, and 154.6 per 100,000 habitants overall, males, and females, respectively (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer). The adjusted ASRs were 84.2, 49.6, and 118.9 per 100,000 overall habitants, males, and females, respectively. The most common sites among men were stomach (ASR 26.0, 52.4%), colorectal (ASR 5.11, 10.15%), and prostate (ASR 2.7, 5.4%). The most common sites in women were cervix (ASR 34.2, 36.7%), breast (ASR 11.2, 12.3%), and stomach (ASR 10.8, 11.7%).  Conclusion:   The Copán-PBCR represents a successful model to develop cancer monitoring in rural LMICs. Innovations included the use of the REDCap platform and leverage of Health Ministry resources. This provides the first PBCR data for Honduras and the Central America Four and confirms that infection-driven cancers, such as gastric and cervical, should be priority targets for cancer control initiatives.""","""['Dalton Argean Norwood', 'Eleazar Enrique Montalvan-Sanchez', 'Juan E Corral', 'Dagoberto Estévez-Ordoñez', 'Andrea A Paredes', 'Lucia B Domínguez', 'Aida A Rodríguez', 'Luis E Bravo', 'Douglas R Morgan', 'Ricardo L Domínguez']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""JCO Glob Oncol""","""['Gastric cancer incidence estimation in a resource-limited nation: use of endoscopy registry methodology.', 'Cancer incidence in Nigeria: a report from population-based cancer registries.', 'Evaluation of Data Quality of Four New Population Based Cancer Registries (PBCRs) in Chandigarh and Punjab, North India- A Quality Control Study.', 'Progress, challenges and ways forward supporting cancer surveillance in Latin America.', 'A diversity of cancer incidence and mortality in West Asian populations.', 'Upper Gastrointestinal Cancer: Delays in Diagnosis and Treatment Caused by Barriers to Healthcare in the Latino Community.']"""

Methods:   MpMRI of 688 prostate lesions in 180 patients were retrospectively reviewed by an experienced radiologist and by a student using PI-RADS V1 and V2. Data sets were reviewed for changes according to PI-RADS V2.1. The results were correlated with results obtained by MR-guided biopsy. Diagnostic potency was evaluated by ROC analysis. Sensitivity, specificity and correct-graded samples were evaluated for different cutpoints. The agreement between radiologist and student was determined for the aggregation of the PI-RADS score in three categories. The student's time needed for evaluation was measured.  Results:   The area under curve of the ROC analysis was 0.782/0.788 (V1/V2) for the student and 0.841/0.833 (V1/V2) for the radiologist. The agreement between student and radiologist showed a Cohen's weighted κ coefficient of 0.495 for V1 and 0.518 for V2. Median student's time needed for score assessment was 4:34 min for PI-RADSv1 and 2:00 min for PI-RADSv2 (p < 0.001). Re-evaluation for V2.1 changed the category in 1.4% of all ratings.  Conclusion:   The capacity of prostate cancer detection using PI-RADS V1 and V2 is dependent on the reader's experience. The results from the two observers indicate that structured reporting using PI-RADS and, controlled by histopathology, can be a valuable and quantifiable tool in students' or residents' education. Herein, V2 was superior to V1 in terms of inter-observer agreement and time efficacy.  Advances in knowledge:   Structured reporting can be a valuable and quantifiable tool in radiologic education.

Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data and pathological characteristics of 96 cases of incidental PCa in 580 patients undergoing radical cystectomy and followed them up for prognosis.  Results:   The incidence rate of incidental PCa was 16.6% (96/580). The patients were 42－90 years old, with a median age of 73 years, 6 (6.2%) ≤60 and 90 (93.8%) over 60 years old. The average maximum diameter of the tumor was about 3.5 cm (range 1.0－9.0 cm). Histologically, 86 (89.6%) of the bladder cancer cases were high-grade invasive urothelial carcinoma (7 with squamous differentiation, 2 with sarcomatoid differentiation, 4 with glandular differentiation, and 1 with plasmacytoid/diffuse variant) and 7 were low-grade urothelial carcinoma, of which 1 case was poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma and 2 cases were bladder adenocarcinoma, including 1 case of signet ring cell carcinoma. All the PCa cases were classified as the histopathological type of classic acinar adenocarcinoma of the prostate, 67 (69.8%) with a Gleason score ≤ 6, and 29 (30.2%) with a Gleason score ≥ 7. Of the total number of incidental PCa cases, 32 (33.3%) were of clinical significance, and 59 (61.5%) of the patients were followed up for 1－95 (mean 28.7) months, during which 42 (71.2%) survived and 17 (28.8%) died, including 2 deaths due to non-cancer factors. No statistically significant difference was found in the median survival time between the 5 clinically significant and 10 non-clinically significant cases (P = 0.322).

Results:   Compared with the blank control group, high-, medium- and low-dose YTD significantly inhibited the proliferation of the PCa DU-145 cells, decreased their adherence and growth (P < 0.05, P < 0.01), promoted their apoptosis (P < 0.01), regulated their cell cycles (P < 0.05, P < 0.01), and reduced their in vitro invasion and migration abilities (P < 0.05), all in a dose-dependent manner.

Methods:   From January 2014 to December 2017, 335 male patients with MRI-negative (PI-RADS 2.0 score ≤ 2) and PSA-abnormal (4－30 ng/ml ) findings underwent systematic prostate biopsy guided by transrectal ultrasound under local anesthesia in our department. We collected and analyzed the demographic data, clinical symptoms, complications, past history and PSA density (PSAD) of the patients.  Results:   Clinically significant PCa was diagnosed in 21 (6.3%) of the 335 patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the independent risk factors were higher age (AUC: 0.704, P < 0.01) and PSAD (AUC: 0.743, P < 0.01). The cutoff values of age and PSAD were 71 years and 0.18 ng/ml/ml, respectively.  Conclusions:   Higher age and PSAD are risk factors for clinically significant PCa.

Methods:   The expression of HMGB1 mRNA in different PCa cell lines and normal prostatic epithelial cells was detected by RT-qPCR. The PC-3 cells were transfected with different HMGB1 small interfering RNAs (si-HMGB1, si-HMGB1-2 and si-HMGB1-3), and the silencing effect was detected. The effects of different concentrations of DTX on the proliferation of the PC-3 cells was determined by MTT. Then the PC-3 cells were randomly divided into five groups: control (conventional culture), si-HMGB1-NC (si-HMGB1-NC transfection), si-HMGB1 (si-HMGB1-3 transfection), DTX (20 nmol/L DTX), and si-HMGB1+DTX (si-HMGB1-3+20 nmol/L DTX transfection), followed by measurement of the survival rate of the cells by MTT, their apoptosis rate by flow cytometry, and the expressions of HMGB1, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) proteins in different groups by Western blot.  Results:   The expression of HMGB1 mRNA in the PC-3 cells was the highest and the lowest after transfection with si-HMGB1-3. DTX inhibited the proliferation of the PC-3 cells at various concentrations. Compared with the control group, the si-HMGB1 and DTX groups showed significantly decreased A values, cell survival rates and HMGB1 and Bcl-2 expressions, but increased cell apoptosis rates and Bax expressions (P < 0.05). In comparison with the si-HMGB1 and DTX groups, the si-HMGB1+DTX group exhibited a remarkably decreased A value, cell survival rate and Bcl-2 expression, but increased cell apoptosis and Bax expression. The expression of the HMGB1 protein was markedly lower in the si-HMGB1+DTX than in the DTX group (P < 0.05).  Conclusions:   Silencing HMGB1 combined with DTX chemotherapy can inhibit the proliferation and promote the apoptosis of PCa cells, which may be attributed to its regulatory effect on the expressions of the Bcl-2 family-related proteins.、.""","""['Wu-Bing Feng', 'Chen Chen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Zhonghua Nan Ke Xue""","""['Protein Disulfide Isomerase 4 Drives Docetaxel Resistance in Prostate Cancer.', 'Bcl-2 family inhibition sensitizes human prostate cancer cells to docetaxel and promotes unexpected apoptosis under caspase-9 inhibition.', 'TGF-β causes Docetaxel resistance in Prostate Cancer via the induction of Bcl-2 by acetylated KLF5 and Protein Stabilization.', 'MiR-129-5p promotes docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer by down-regulating CAMK2N1 expression.', 'Effect of sodium phenylbutyrate on the sensitivity of PC3/DTX-resistant prostate cancer cells to docetaxel.']"""

The proliferation, invasion and migration abilities and EMT were decreased and the apoptosis increased in the DU145 and LNCaP cells with knockdown of hsa_circ_0005221, which was just the reverse in those with overexpressed hsa_circ_0005221. Among the top 5 miRNAs predicted by software, miR-339-5p, miR-17 and miR-520h were shown by pull-down assay to be bound to hsa_circ_0005221, with most obvious changes in miR-339-5p when hsa_circ_0005221 knocked down or overexpressed. Luciferase reporter gene assay showed the binding of hsa_circ_0005221 to miR-339-5p. Knockdown of hsa_circ_0005221 and transfection of miR-339-5p mimics into the DU145 and LNCaP cells significantly reduced the proliferation, invasion and migration abilities of the cells and the N-cad level, increased their apoptosis and E-cad level, and up-regulated the expression of STAT5a, while overexpression of hsa_circ_0005221 and transfection of miR-339-5p mimics induced just the opposite effects.

We analyzed the ultimate clinical outcomes of such patients using the current risk sub-stratification schema.  Patients and methods:   We included 693 patients with localized IR prostate cancer treated via low-dose-rate brachytherapy (LDR-BT) with or without external beam radiation (EBRT) and with or without androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) in a single institution. Treatment outcomes (biochemical recurrence-free survival [BCRFS] and clinical progression-free survival [CPFS]) were compared according to the numbers of unfavorable findings.  Results:   Out of the 693 IR patients, 292 (42.1%) exhibited favorable disease; the remaining 401 (57.9%) exhibited unfavorable disease. Compared with favorable IR status, unfavorable IR status was associated with shorter BCRFS and CPFS (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). Patients with two to three unfavorable factors experienced the worst oncological outcomes (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001). Although patients with one or no unfavorable factors responded similarly to LDR-BT monotherapy, this treatment modality was insufficient for preventing biochemical and clinical progression in patients with multiple unfavorable findings.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 392 men who underwent SBx and TBx in case of suspicious lesions from November 2016 to October 2019. Triggers for a biopsy were an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and/or positive digital rectal examination and only treatment naïve patients without a previous diagnosis of PCa were included. Study inclusion occurred before biopsy and a prebiopsy mpMRI was available in all men. SBx were taken from 20 different locations according to the modified Barzell zones. The primary endpoint was the detection rate of clinically significant PCa (csPCa) and insignificant PCa (ciPCa) by SBx and/or TBx by comparing the two methods alone and in combination. Additional TBx were taken for any prostate imaging-reporting and data system (PI-RADS) lesion ≥3 seen on the mpMRI. csPCa was defined as any Gleason score ≥7 and ciPCa as Gleason score 6.  Results:   A total of 392 men with a median age of 64 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 58-69), a median PSA of 7.0 ng/ml (IQR: 4.8-10.1) were enrolled. Overall, PCa was found in 200 (51%) of all biopsied men, with 158 (79%) being csPCa and 42 (21%) ciPCa. A total of 268 (68%) men with a suspicious mpMRI and underwent a combined TBx and SBx, of whom csPCa was found in 139 (52%). In this subgroup, 116/139 (83%) csPCa would have been detected by TBx alone, and an additional 23 (17%) were found by SBx. Men with a negative mpMRI (PI-RADS < 3, n = 124, 32%) were found to have csPCa in 19 (15%) cases. In patients with a negative mpMRI in combination with a PSA density <0.1 ng/ml2 , only 8% (3/36) had csPCa. If only TBx would have been performed and all men with a negative mpMRI would not have been biopsed, 42/158 (27%) of csPCa would have been missed, and 38/42 (90%) ciPCa would have not been detected. On multivariable analysis, significant predictors of csPCa were increasing PSA (odds ratio, OR: 1.07 [95% confidence interval, CI: 1.03-1.11]), increasing age (OR: 1.07 [95% CI: 1.03-1.11]), PI-RADS score ≥ 3 (OR: 6.49 [95% CI: 3.55-11.89]), and smaller prostate volume (OR: 0.96 [95% CI: 0.95 -0.97] (p < 0.05 for all parameters).  Conclusion:   In comparison to SBx, TBx alone detects csPCa in only ¾ of all men with a positive mpMRI lesion. Thus, systematic biopsies in addition to TBx have to be considered at least in some who undergo a prostate biopsy. In men with a negative mpMRI, SBx still detects 15% csPCa, but similarly overdetecting ciPCa. According to our results, low PSA density and negative mpMRI findings could be used to decide which men can safely avoid biopsy.""","""['Basil Kaufmann', 'Karim Saba', 'Tobias S Schmidli', 'Stephanie Stutz', 'Leon Bissig', 'Anna Jelena Britschgi', 'Evodia Schaeren', 'Alexander Gu', 'Nicole Langenegger', 'Tullio Sulser', 'Daniel Eberli', 'Etienne X Keller', 'Thomas Hermanns', 'Cédric Poyet']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment in Biopsy-naïve Patients: The Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator in Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS) Fusion Biopsy and Systematic TRUS Biopsy.', 'Detection of clinically significant prostate cancer by transperineal multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion targeted prostate biopsy in smaller prostates.', 'Optimizing prostate-targeted biopsy schemes in men with multiple mpMRI visible lesions: should we target all suspicious areas?

Characterizing tumor perfusion by exploiting the fractal nature of vascular anatomy might elucidate the aggressive potential of a tumor. This study introduces the concept of fractal analysis for characterizing prostate cancer perfusion and reports about its usefulness for non-invasive prediction of tumor grade.  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the openly available PROSTATEx dataset with 112 cancer foci in 99 patients. In all patients, histological grading groups specified by the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) were obtained from in-bore MRI-guided biopsy. Fractal analysis of dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion MRI sequences was performed, yielding fractal dimension (FD) as quantitative descriptor. Two-class and multiclass diagnostic accuracy was analyzed using area under the curve (AUC) receiver operating characteristic analysis, and optimal FD cutoffs were established. Additionally, we compared fractal analysis to conventional apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements.  Results:   Fractal analysis of perfusion allowed accurate differentiation of non-significant (group 1) and clinically significant (groups 2-5) cancer with a sensitivity of 91% (confidence interval [CI]: 83-96%) and a specificity of 86% (CI: 73-94%). FD correlated linearly with ISUP groups (r2 = 0.874, p < 0.001). Significant groupwise differences were obtained between low, intermediate, and high ISUP group 1-4 (p ≤ 0.001) but not group 5 tumors. Fractal analysis of perfusion was significantly more reliable than ADC in predicting non-significant and clinically significant cancer (AUCFD = 0.97 versus AUCADC = 0.77, p < 0.001).  Conclusion:   Fractal analysis of perfusion MRI accurately predicts prostate cancer grading in low-, intermediate-, and high-, but not highest-grade, tumors.  Key points:   • In 112 prostate carcinomas, fractal analysis of MR perfusion imaging accurately differentiated low-, intermediate-, and high-grade cancer (ISUP grade groups 1-4). • Fractal analysis detected clinically significant prostate cancer with a sensitivity of 91% (83-96%) and a specificity of 86% (73-94%). • Fractal dimension of perfusion at the tumor margin may provide an imaging biomarker to predict prostate cancer grading.""","""['Florian Michallek', 'Henkjan Huisman', 'Bernd Hamm', 'Sefer Elezkurtaj', 'Andreas Maxeiner', 'Marc Dewey']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Accuracy of fractal analysis and PI-RADS assessment of prostate magnetic resonance imaging for prediction of cancer grade groups: a clinical validation study.', 'Can Extraprostatic Extension Be Predicted by Tumor-Capsule Contact Length in Prostate Cancer?

Here, we present a novel two-step acoustophoresis (A2) method for isolation of unfixed, viable cancer cells from red blood cell (RBC) lysed whole blood. The A2 method uses an initial acoustofluidic preseparation step to separate cells based on their acoustic mobility. This acoustofluidic step enriches viable cancer cells in a central outlet, but a significant number of white blood cells (WBCs) remain in the central outlet fraction due to overlapping acoustophysical properties of these viable cells. A subsequent purging step was employed to remove contaminating WBCs through negative selection acoustophoresis with anti-CD45-functionalized negative acoustic contrast particles. We processed 1 mL samples of 1:1 diluted RBC lysed whole blood mixed with 10 000 DU145 cells through the A2 method. Additional experiments were performed using 1000 DU145 cells spiked into 1.5 × 106 WBCs in 1 mL of buffer to further elucidate the dynamic range of the method. Using samples with 10 000 DU145 cells, we obtained 459 ± 188-fold depletion of WBC and 42% recovery of viable cancer cells. Based on spiked samples with 1000 DU145 cells, our cancer cell recovery was 28% with 247 ± 156-fold WBC depletion corresponding to a depletion efficacy of ≥99.5%.

Conversely, androgen deprivation in vitro and in vivo increases MYC expression. In parallel, global AR activity is suppressed by MYC overexpression, consistent with coactivator redistribution. These suppressive effects of AR and MYC are mitigated at shared AR/MYC binding sites, which also have markedly higher levels of H3K27 acetylation, indicating enrichment for functional enhancers.

Patient survival would benefit if this can be prevented or reversed. Cancer de-differentiation transforms luminal-like (differentiated) adenocarcinoma into less luminal-like and more stem-like (undifferentiated) small cell carcinoma through a sequential activation of stem cell transcription factors (scTF) POU5F1, LIN28A, SOX2 and NANOG. Like stem cells, prostate small cell carcinoma express this quartet of scTF as well as a 10-fold lower level of β2-microglobulin (B2M) than that of differentiated cell types. In organ development, prostate stromal mesenchyme cells mediate epithelial differentiation in part by secreted factors.  Methods:   The identified prostate stromal-specific factor proenkephalin (PENK) was cloned, and transfected into scTF+B2Mlo stem-like small cell carcinoma LuCaP 145.1, reprogrammed luminal-like scTF-B2Mhi LNCaP, and luminal-like scTF-B2Mhi adenocarcinoma LuCaP 70CR. The expression of scTF, B2M and anterior gradient 2 (AGR2) was analyzed in the transfected cells.  Results:   PENK caused down-regulation of scTF and up-regulation of B2M to indicate differentiation. When transfected into reprogrammed LNCaP, PENK reversed the reprogramming by down-regulation of scTF with attendant changes in cell appearance and colony morphology. When transfected into LuCaP 70CR, PENK up-regulated the expression of adenocarcinoma antigen AGR2, a marker associated with cancer cell differentiation.  Conclusions:   Prostate cancer cells appear to retain their responsiveness to stromal PENK signaling. PENK can induce differentiation to counter de-differentiation caused by scTF activation. The many mutations and aneuploidy characteristic of cancer cells appear not to hinder these two processes. Loss of prostate cancer differentiation is like reprogramming from luminal-like to stem-like.""","""['Alvin Y Liu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Lineage relationship between prostate adenocarcinoma and small cell carcinoma.', 'Conversion of Prostate Adenocarcinoma to Small Cell Carcinoma-Like by Reprogramming.', 'Reprogramming of prostate cancer-associated stromal cells to embryonic stem-like.', 'Yin Yang 1 is associated with cancer stem cell transcription factors (SOX2, OCT4, BMI1) and clinical implication.', 'Mediators of induced pluripotency and their role in cancer cells - current scientific knowledge and future perspectives.']"""

Reduced NCOR2 expression significantly associates with shorter disease-free survival in patients with PC receiving adjuvant ADT. Utilizing the CWR22 xenograft model, we demonstrate that stably reduced NCOR2 expression accelerates disease recurrence following ADT, associates with gene expression patterns that include neuroendocrine features, and induces DNA hypermethylation. Stably reduced NCOR2 expression in isogenic LNCaP (androgen-sensitive) and LNCaP-C4-2 (androgen-independent) cells revealed that NCOR2 reduction phenocopies the impact of androgen treatment and induces global DNA hypermethylation patterns. NCOR2 genomic binding is greatest in LNCaP-C4-2 cells and most clearly associates with forkhead box (FOX) transcription factor FOXA1 binding. NCOR2 binding significantly associates with transcriptional regulation most when in active enhancer regions.

The association between disease onset and outcome and socioeconomic status (SES) was assessed in the mortality by cause in two periods, using indices referred to the distribution of deprivation in the population defined in a ten-years span (2001 to 2011).  Material and methods:   Two Socio-Economic and Health Deprivation Indices (SEHDIs), computed at census tract level (2001 and 2011 Censuses), were applied to analyse the SMRs by cause, age (0-64 and 65+ years) and gender of the five normalised groups of deprivation individuated in the two population distribution. The associations between SES and onset of disease was described in the mortality 2008-11 using the index referred to 2001 population. The second index, referred to 2011 population, described the associations between SES and disease outcomes in the mortality 2009-13. Two ANOVAs evaluated the statistical significance (p < 0.05) of differences in death distribution among groups.  Results:   The population at medium-high deprivation increased in Genoa between 2001 and 2011. The mortality by age and gender showed different trends. Not significant trends (NS) in both periods regarded only the younger (respiratory diseases in both sexes, prostate cancer, diabetes in women). Linearly positives (L↑) trends in both periods were observed only in men (all cancers and lung cancers, overall mortality and cardiovascular diseases in younger, diabetes in older). Not linear trends (NL) in both periods interested both sexes for flu and pneumonia, women for lung cancer, old women for overall mortality and respiratory diseases, old men for colorectal cancers. Instead, L↑ trends in the final phases of disease interest all cancers in the elderly (NS trend at the disease onset), all cancers and breast cancer in young women, diabetes and colorectal cancers in young men (NL trends at the disease onset). On the contrary, L↑ trends at the disease onset and NL trends in the final phases regarded cardiovascular diseases in elderly, overall mortality, respiratory diseases and prostate cancer in old men, diabetes and colorectal cancers in old women. Finally, NL trends at the disease onset regarded colorectal cancers in young women (NS trend in the final phases) and breast cancer in the older (linearly negative trend, L↓, in the final phases).  Discussion:   Deprivation trends confirmed the literature about populations shifting towards poverty. Aging-linked social risks were revealed, reflecting the weakening of social-health care, which worsened in elderly if alone. Serious problems in younger singles or in the single-parent families arose. Cardiovascular diseases, all cancers and colorectal cancers trends confirmed the advantage of less deprived when diseases are preventable and curable. Prostate and breast cancers trends reflected the rising incidence and increasing problems in care. The need of corrective interventions in social and health policies was emerging, aimed to support in a targeted way a population in an alarming condition of socio-economic deterioration.""","""['Marina Vercelli', 'Roberto Lillini']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Prev Med Hyg""","""['Deindustrialisation, demographic decline, aging, economic crisis and social involution in a metropolitan area analysed by applying Socio-Economic and Health Deprivation Indices.', 'The local Socio-Economic Health Deprivation Index: methods and results.', 'Influenza vaccination coverage and deprivation among the elderly in the municipality of Cagliari: results and perspectives.', 'Mortality Atlas of the Campania Region.

Methods:   A generic proton PBS gantry was modeled as being integrated with a realistic split-bore MRI system in the perpendicular orientation. MRI field strengths were modeled as 0.5, 1, and 1.5 T. The PBS beam delivery and dose calculation was modeled using the TOPAS Monte Carlo toolkit coupled with matRad as the optimizer engine. A water phantom, liver, and prostate plans were evaluated and optimized in the presence of the full MRI field distribution. A simple combination of gantry angle offset and small PBS nozzle skew was used to direct the proton beams along a path that closely follows the reference planning scenario, that is, without magnetic field.  Results:   All planning metrics could be successfully achieved with the inclusion of gantry angle offsets in the range of 8 ∘ $^{\circ }$ -29 ∘ $^{\circ }$ when coupled with a PBS nozzle skew of 1.6 ∘ $^{\circ }$ -4.4 ∘ $^{\circ }$ . These two hardware-based corrections were selected to minimize the average Euclidean distance (AED) in the beam path enabling the proton beams to travel inside the patient in a path that is close to the original path (AED smaller than 3 mm at 1.5 T). Final dose optimization, performed through further changes in the PBS delivery, was then shown to be feasible for our selection of plans studied yielding comparable plan quality metrics to reference conditions.

Experimental design:   We first performed methylated immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing (MeDIP-seq) on a training set of tumors, identified differentially methylated regions between NEPC and CR-PRAD, and built a model to predict the presence of NEPC (termed NEPC Risk Score).

Results:   The test cohort comprised cfDNA samples from 48 men, 9 with NEPC and 39 with CR-PRAD. NEPC Risk Scores were significantly higher in men with NEPC than CR-PRAD (P = 4.3 × 10-7) and discriminated between NEPC and CR-PRAD with high accuracy (AUROC 0.96).

Methods:   Using nested case-control studies from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, study-specific associations between self-reported history of benign ovarian cysts, uterine fibroids, and endometriosis with inflammatory marker concentrations were evaluated using logistic regression and combined using meta-analysis. Inflammatory markers associated with individual benign pathologies were mutually adjusted for one another to evaluate independent associations.  Results:   Compared to women without a self-reported history of the pathology evaluated, benign ovarian cysts were associated with increased PAI-1 (OR [95% CI] 6.24 [2.53-15.39], P <.001) and TGF-β1 (3.79 [1.62-8.86], P =.002) and decreased BCA-1 (0.38 [0.19-0.73], P =.004). Uterine fibroids were associated with decreased CXCL11 (0.37 [0.22-0.63], P <.001) and VEGFR3 (0.40 [0.24-0.65], P <.001). Endometriosis was associated with increased SIL-4R (4.75 [1.84-12.26], P =.001).  Conclusions:   Self-reported history of benign gynecologic pathologies were associated with alterations in inflammatory markers that have been previously linked to cancer risk.

Materials and methods:   Included patients underwent mpMRI followed by urine collection and prostate biopsy at the University of Michigan between 2015 -2019. MPS values were calculated from urine specimens using the validated model based on serum PSA, urinary PCA3, and urinary TMPRSS2:ERG. In the PI-RADS 3 population, the discriminative accuracy of PSA, PSAD, and MPS for GG≥2 cancer was quantified by the AUC curve. Decision curve analysis was used to assess net benefit of MPS relative to PSAD.  Results:   There were 540 patients that underwent mpMRI and biopsy with MPS available. The prevalence of GG≥2 cancer was 13% for PI-RADS 3, 56% for PI-RADS 4, and 87% for PI-RADS 5. MPS was significantly higher in men with GG≥2 cancer [median 44.9, IQR (29.4 -57.5)] than those with negative or GG1 biopsy [median 29.2, IQR (14.8 -44.2); P <.001] in the overall population and when stratified by PI-RADS score. In the PI-RADS 3 population (n = 121), the AUC for predicting GG≥2 cancer was 0.55 for PSA, 0.62 for PSAD, and 0.73 for MPS. MPS provided the highest net clinical benefit across all pertinent threshold probabilities.  Conclusion:   In patients that underwent mpMRI and biopsy, MPS was significantly associated with GG≥2 cancer across all PI-RADS scores. In the PI-RADS 3 population, MPS significantly outperformed PSAD in ruling out GG≥2 cancer.

Methods:   A total of 200,643 individuals from the UK Biobank were categorized as follows: (1) heterozygotes or nonheterozygotes for PVs in moderate to high-risk cancer genes, (2) PRS strata, and (3) with or without a family history of cancer. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to compute the odds ratio across groups and the cumulative incidence through life.  Results:   Cumulative incidence by age 70 years among the nonheterozygotes across PRS strata ranged from 9% to 32% and from 9% to 35% for breast cancer and prostate cancer, respectively. Among the PV heterozygotes it ranged from 20% to 48% in moderate-risk genes and from 51% to 74% in high-risk genes for breast cancer, and it ranged from 30% to 59% in prostate cancer risk genes. Family history was always associated with an increased cancer odds ratio.

Methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Registry (SEER, 2004-2016), we identified non-metastatic stage T1-2 or T3-4 VHBC and UCUB patients, who underwent RC. CSM and lymph node invasion (LNI) rates were stratified according to PLND extent, as well as coded continuously in multivariate Cox and logistic regression models.  Results:   Of 19,020 patients, 1736 (9.1%) were coded as having VHBC (46.9% squamous cell carcinoma, 22.5% adenocarcinoma, 18.9% neuroendocrine carcinoma, 11.7% not otherwise specified) vs 17,284 (90.9%) UCUB. PLND was performed in 80.1 of VHBC vs. 83.5% UCUB patients. In both histological groups, PLND rates increased over time (70.9-89.6% and 76.2%-90.1%, both P < .01). PLND extent did not significantly affect CSM in stage T1-2 or T3-4 VHBC patients. Conversely, PLND extent was associated with lower CSM in T1-2, as well as in T3-4 UCUB patients, which was confirmed in multivariate Cox analyses (Hazard ratio [HR] 0.99, P < .001).

Analysis and comparison of two commercially available algorithms""","""Introduction:   This study aimed to assess and compare the capabilities of two commercially available deformable image registration algorithms implemented in Raystation 9A (A1) and Velocity AI (A2) for possible usage in adaptive prostate radiotherapy based on the propagation of anatomical contours from computed tomography (CT) images to cone-beam CT (CBCT) images.  Material and methods:   Ten patients were retrospectively selected from a group treated for localized prostate cancer. The propagation of rectum contours was analyzed in a set of CT-CBCT pairs. Two independent observers carried out qualitative analysis using the two-level descriptive scale (meet/fail). Quantitative analysis was done using landmark points distances based on implanted markers as navigation points and differently obtained contours (manually and automatically using DIR algorithms). Quantitative analysis was taken on sets preselected by qualitative analysis.  Results:   Qualitative analysis shows that 83.7% of the rectum contours were scored identically (meet or fail) for both algorithms, from which 53.5% and 55.8% are failed results for A1 and A2, respectively. For the rectum size (RWD parameter), differences between referenced and deformation-based values were 5.5 and 5.8mm, and for the rectum wall, the prostate marker distance (WMD parameter) was 4.5 and 5.5mm for A1 and A2, respectively. The differences between the WMD parameters were statistically significant (p=0.007).  Conclusions:   In both tested algorithms, neither effectiveness nor measured uncertainties in the propagation of rectum contour process in prostate patient cases were satisfactory.

Methods:   Men in the SEARCH cohort undergoing RP between 1988 and 2017 (N = 6242) were studied for PC-specific mortality (PCSM) as the primary outcome, and for biochemical recurrence (BCR), castration-resistant PC (CRPC) and metastasis as secondary outcomes.

Although suggested, the relationship between MetS and prostate cancer (PCa) is still inconclusive. Very few studies have addressed this question in populations of African descent, which are disproportionately affected by PCa. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of MetS among incident cases of Afro-Caribbean PCa and estimate its association with adverse clinicopathological features and the risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy (RP).  Materials and methods:   We included 285 consecutive patients with incident cases of PCa attending the University Hospital of Guadeloupe (French West Indies). MetS was evaluated at the time of diagnosis by collecting information on blood pressure, glycaemic status, triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and obesity through various surrogates, including two waist circumference indicators (≤94 cm, ≥102 cm), the waist-to-hip ratio (≥0.95), and body mass index (BMI; ≥30 kg/m2 ). We followed 245 patients who underwent RP as primary treatment of localized PCa.  Results:   The prevalence of MetS varied greatly, from 31.6% to 16.4%, when a waist circumference ≥94 cm or BMI were used as obesity surrogates, respectively. No significant associations were found between MetS, regardless of the obesity criteria employed, and the risk of adverse pathological features or BCR.  Conclusions:   The high variability in MetS resulting from the diversity of obesity criteria used may explain the discordant associations reported in the literature. Further studies using strict and uniform criteria to define MetS on homogeneous ethnic groups are encouraged to clarify the association, if any, between MetS and PCa outcomes.""","""['Florian Lefebvre', 'Anne Blanchet-Deverly', 'Leah Michineau', 'Pascal Blanchet', 'Luc Multigner', 'Laurent Brureau']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Predictors of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy in an Afro-Caribbean population in Guadeloupe (French West Indies).', 'Metabolic syndrome and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol are associated with adverse pathological features in patients with prostate cancer treated by radical prostatectomy.', 'Metabolic syndrome is associated with advanced prostate cancer in patients treated with radical retropubic prostatectomy: results from a multicentre prospective study.', 'Meta-analysis of metabolic syndrome and prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer among Jamaican men: exploring the evidence for higher risk.', 'Metabolic syndrome and its components predict the biochemical recurrence and adverse pathological features of patients following radical prostatectomy: a propensity score matching study.', 'Metabolic syndrome and metastatic prostate cancer correlation study, a real-world study in a prostate cancer clinical research center, Xinjiang, China.', 'Statin Use and the Risk of Prostate Cancer Biochemical Recurrence Following Definitive Therapy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Cohort Studies.']"""

However, its repertoire in PC development and chemoresistance remains to be documented.  Methods:   Expression of circDPP4, microRNA (miR)-564, and zinc finger of the cerebellum 2 (ZIC2) was detected by a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting; the direct interaction was validated by an RNA pull-down assay, a dual-luciferase reporter assay, and RNA immunoprecipitation. Cell progression was measured by a cell-counting kit-8 assay, colony formation assay, flow cytometry, a transwell assay, a xenograft experiment, and immunohistochemistry. DTX cytotoxicity was confirmed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell viability assay.  Results:   Expression of circDPP4 is upregulated in PC tumors from 60 patients and PC cell lines, and a higher circDPP4 might predict poor overall survival. Decreasing circDPP4 suppresses cell proliferation, colony formation, migration/invasion, and 50% inhibitory concentration of DTX in PC cells, and promotes the apoptosis rate. Both overexpressing miR-564 and inhibiting ZIC2 could imitate those effects, whereas inhibiting miR-564 and restoring ZIC2 could separately counteract them. Mechanistically, circDPP4 functions as a miR-564 sponge and regulates the expression of ZIC2, a target gene for miR-564.

Methods:   The LAPCD study collected information from 35,823 men across the UK who were 18-42 months post-diagnosis of prostate cancer. Men who were still alive 12 months later were resurveyed. Generic HRQL (EQ-5D-5L plus self-assessed health rating) and prostate cancer-specific outcomes (EPIC-26) were assessed. Treatment(s) received was self-reported. Previously defined clinically meaningful differences were used to evaluate changes in outcomes over time.  Results:   A total of 28,450 men across all disease stages completed follow-up surveys (85.8% response). Of the 21,700 included in this study, 89.7% reported no additional treatments since the first survey. This group experienced stable urinary and bowel outcomes, with good function for most men at both time points. On-going poor (but stable) urinary issues were associated with previous surgery. Sexual function scores remained low (mean: 26.8/100). Self-assessed health ratings were stable over time. The largest declines in HRQL and functional outcomes were experienced by men reporting their first active treatment between surveys.  Discussion:   The results suggest stability of HRQL and most specific morbidities by 18-42 months for men who report no further treatment in the subsequent 12 months. This is reassuring for those with good function and HRQL but re-enforces the need for early intervention and support for men who experience poor outcomes.""","""['Samantha J Mason', 'Amy Downing', 'Sarah Wilding', 'Luke Hounsome', 'Penny Wright', 'Eila Watson', 'Richard Wagland', 'Hugh Butcher', 'Paul Kind', 'Peter Selby', 'Anna Gavin', 'Adam W Glaser']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['Quality of life in men living with advanced and localised prostate cancer in the UK: a population-based study.', 'Decision regret in men living with and beyond nonmetastatic prostate cancer in the United Kingdom: A population-based patient-reported outcome study.', 'Active monitoring, radical prostatectomy and radical radiotherapy in PSA-detected clinically localised prostate cancer: the ProtecT three-arm RCT.', 'Psychosocial interventions for men with prostate cancer: a Cochrane systematic review.', 'Psychosocial interventions for men with prostate cancer.', 'Cone-beam CT delta-radiomics to predict genitourinary toxicities and international prostate symptom of prostate cancer patients: a pilot study.']"""

While truncating variants in CHEK2 are known to be pathogenic, the interpretation of missense variants of uncertain significance (VUS) is challenging. Consequently, many VUS remain unclassified both functionally and clinically. Here we describe a mouse embryonic stem (mES) cell-based system to quantitatively determine the functional impact of 50 missense VUS in human CHEK2. By assessing the activity of human CHK2 to phosphorylate one of its main targets, Kap1, in Chek2 knockout mES cells, 31 missense VUS in CHEK2 were found to impair protein function to a similar extent as truncating variants, while 9 CHEK2 missense VUS resulted in intermediate functional defects. Mechanistically, most VUS impaired CHK2 kinase function by causing protein instability or by impairing activation through (auto)phosphorylation. Quantitative results showed that the degree of CHK2 kinase dysfunction correlates with an increased risk for breast cancer. Both damaging CHEK2 variants as a group [OR 2.23; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.62-3.07; P < 0.0001] and intermediate variants (OR 1.63; 95% CI, 1.21-2.20; P = 0.0014) were associated with an increased breast cancer risk, while functional variants did not show this association (OR 1.13; 95% CI, 0.87-1.46; P = 0.378). Finally, a damaging VUS in CHEK2, c.486A>G/p.D162G, was also identified, which cosegregated with familial prostate cancer. Altogether, these functional assays efficiently and reliably identified VUS in CHEK2 that associate with cancer.

In randomized phase III trials, rPFS showed good correlation with OS at the individual trial level. We aimed to assess the correlation between the hazard ratios (HR) of IBIE and OS among PCWG2-based randomized trials.  Materials and methods:   PubMed and EMBASE databases were systematically searched for randomized trials evaluating systemic treatments on mCRPC using PCWG2 up to April 15, 2020. Hazard ratios for OS and IBIEs were extracted and their correlation was assessed using weighted linear regression. Subgroup analyses were performed according to various clinical settings: prior chemotherapy, drug category, type of IBIE (rPFS vs. composite IBIE, latter defined as progression by imaging and one or a combination of PSA, pain, skeletal-related events, and performance status), and publication year.  Results:   Twenty-eight phase II-III randomized trials (16,511 patients) were included. Correlation between OS and IBIE was good (R2 = 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35-0.78). Trials using rPFS showed substantially higher correlation than those using a composite IBIE (R2 = 0.58, 95% CI, 0.32-0.82 vs. 0.00, 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.01). Correlations between OS and IBIE in other subgroups were at least moderate in nearly all subgroups (R2 = 0.32-0.91).

Materials and methods:   Twenty patients treated with 78 Gy to the prostate and 56 Gy to elective pelvic lymph nodes were included. VMAT plans were generated with standard clinical PTV margins. Additionally to the planning MR, patients had three MRI scans during treatment to simulate an MRgART. A reference plan with PTV margins determined for MRgART was created per patient and adapted to each of the following MRs. Adapted plans were warped to the planning MR for dose accumulation. The standard plan was rigidly registered to each adaptation MR before it was warped to the planning MR for dose accumulation. Dosimetric impact was compared by DVH analysis and potential clinical effects were assessed by NTCP modeling.  Results:   MRgART yielded statistically significant lower doses for the bladder wall, rectum and peritoneal cavity, compared to the standard RT, which translated into reduced median risks of urine incontinence (ΔNTCP 2.8%), urine voiding pain (ΔNTCP 2.8%) and acute gastrointestinal toxicity (ΔNTCP 17.4%). Mean population accumulated doses were as good or better for all investigated OAR when planned for MRgART as standard RT.

This study aims to evaluate PTEN loss and PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry in different histological patterns of PCa.  Methods:   The current study included consecutive 98 radical prostatectomy specimens with 151 foci with different Gleason Grade (GG) patterns.  Results:   The highest frequency of PTEN loss was observed in GG4 cribriform and glomeruloid patterns (59.3%, p < 0.001). Combined score (CS) PD-L1 positivity was observed in fourteen patients (14.2%). Tumor cell (TC) and tumor-associated inflammatory cells (IC) PD-L1 positivity was observed in 10 (10.2%) and 7 (7.1%) patients. The highest frequency of PD-L1 expression was observed in the GG5 pattern, and between GG4 patterns, the irregular pattern had the highest PD-L1 positivity.  Conclusions:   In conclusion, in our cohort of consecutive unselected cases of prostatic carcinoma, we observed the highest PTEN loss rate in the GG4 cribriform and glomeruloid pattern and the highest PD-L1 expression rate in the GG5 and GG4 irregular patterns. These results may predict molecular differences between different histological patterns in PCa and may be used to inform a treatment decision. Future studies should investigate these differences between histological patterns of PCa to predict response to immunotherapy in larger cohorts.""","""['Gozde Kir', 'Gozde Ecem Cecikoglu', 'Zeynep Cagla Olgun', 'Huseyin Ozgur Kazan', 'Asif Yildirim']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Pathol Res Pract""","""['Correlation of PD-L1 expression with immunohistochemically determined molecular profile in endometrial carcinomas.', 'PTEN loss in prostatic adenocarcinoma correlates with specific adverse histologic features (intraductal carcinoma, cribriform Gleason pattern 4 and stromogenic carcinoma).', 'PTEN expression and morphological patterns in prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Paucity of PD-L1 expression in prostate cancer: innate and adaptive immune resistance.', 'Prostate cancer with cribriform morphology: diagnosis, aggressiveness, molecular pathology and possible relationships with intraductal carcinoma.']"""

Many attempts at designing drug delivery systems against cancer were made that incorporates ICG as a photothermal, photodynamic or imaging agent. However, most of these systems contain at least one more drug, making it hard to assess the effects of ICG alone.  Methods:   Nanoparticles (ICGNP) were prepared via nanoprecipitation. The effects of phase volume ratio and ICG concentration on size, loading capacity and encapsulation efficiency were explored. Photothermal and photodynamic properties of ICGNP were examined. PC-3 cells were used for cell viability tests. Irradiation was achieved via custom built 809-nm computer controlled diode laser at 1 W/cm2 (up to 600 J/cm2). Data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Tukey's test (p ≤ 0.05).  Results:   ICGNP exhibited mean size of 300 nm with low polydispersity, and zeta potential of -14 mV. Upon laser irradiation, ICGNP were capable of causing temperature increase and producing singlet oxygen. On PC-3 cells, ICGNP were proved to be as effective as free ICG in inducing cell death. The measured temperature increase in culture medium and experiments with singlet oxygen quenchers suggest that the decrease in cell viability was mainly the result of photothermal action.

Materials and methods:   Twenty five prostate cancer patients underwent MRI-based low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy (LDRPBT). The patients were scanned with a 3D T2-weighted sequence for treatment planning and a 3D T2/T1-weighted sequence for quality assessment. Seven observers involved with the LDRPBT workflow delineated the prostate, external urinary sphincter (EUS), seminal vesicles, rectum, and bladder on all 50 MRIs. IoV was assessed by measuring contour similarity metrics, differences in organ volumes, and differences in dosimetry parameters between unique observer pairs. Measurements from a group of 3 radiation oncologists (G1) were compared against those from a group consisting of the other 4 clinical observers (G2).  Results:   IoV of the prostate was lower for G1 than G2 (Matthew's correlation coefficient [MCC], G1 vs. G2: planning-0.906 vs. 0.870, p < 0.001; postimplant-0.899 vs. 0.861, p < 0.001).

This study validates the diagnostic accuracy of the recently suggested fractal dimension (FD) of perfusion for detecting clinically significant cancer.  Materials and methods:   Routine clinical MR imaging data, acquired at 3 T without an endorectal coil including dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences, of 72 prostate cancer foci in 64 patients were analyzed. In-bore MRI-guided biopsy with International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grading served as reference standard. Previously established FD cutoffs for predicting tumor grade were compared to measurements of the apparent diffusion coefficient (25th percentile, ADC25) and PI-RADS assessment with and without inclusion of the FD as separate criterion.  Results:   Fractal analysis allowed prediction of ISUP grade groups 1 to 4 but not 5, with high agreement to the reference standard (κFD = 0.88 [CI: 0.79-0.98]). Integrating fractal analysis into PI-RADS allowed a strong improvement in specificity and overall accuracy while maintaining high sensitivity for significant cancer detection (ISUP > 1; PI-RADS alone: sensitivity = 96%, specificity = 20%, area under the receiver operating curve [AUC] = 0.65; versus PI-RADS with fractal analysis: sensitivity = 95%, specificity = 88%, AUC = 0.92, p < 0.001). ADC25 only differentiated low-grade group 1 from pooled higher-grade groups 2-5 (κADC = 0.36 [CI: 0.12-0.59]). Importantly, fractal analysis was significantly more reliable than ADC25 in predicting non-significant and clinically significant cancer (AUCFD = 0.96 versus AUCADC = 0.75, p < 0.001). Diagnostic accuracy was not significantly affected by zone location.  Conclusions:   Fractal analysis is accurate in noninvasively predicting tumor grades in prostate cancer and adds independent information when implemented into PI-RADS assessment. This opens the opportunity to individually adjust biopsy priority and method in individual patients.  Key points:   • Fractal analysis of perfusion is accurate in noninvasively predicting tumor grades in prostate cancer using dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences (κFD = 0.88). • Including the fractal dimension into PI-RADS as a separate criterion improved specificity (from 20 to 88%) and overall accuracy (AUC from 0.86 to 0.96) while maintaining high sensitivity (96% versus 95%) for predicting clinically significant cancer. • Fractal analysis was significantly more reliable than ADC25 in predicting clinically significant cancer (AUCFD = 0.96 versus AUCADC = 0.75).""","""['Florian Michallek', 'Henkjan Huisman', 'Bernd Hamm', 'Sefer Elezkurtaj', 'Andreas Maxeiner#', 'Marc Dewey#']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Prediction of prostate cancer grade using fractal analysis of perfusion MRI: retrospective proof-of-principle study.', 'Use of the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) for Prostate Cancer Detection with Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Diagnostic Meta-analysis.', 'A Single Center Evaluation of the Diagnostic Accuracy of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging against Transperineal Prostate Mapping Biopsy: An Analysis of Men with Benign Histology and Insignificant Cancer following Transrectal Ultrasound Biopsy.', 'Prevalence of Prostate Cancer in PI-RADS Version 2.1 Transition Zone Atypical Nodules Upgraded by Abnormal DWI: Correlation With MRI-Directed TRUS-Guided Targeted Biopsy.', 'PI-RADS Version 2: A Pictorial Update.', ""The impact of AI suggestions on radiologists' decisions: a pilot study of explainability and attitudinal priming interventions in mammography examination."", 'The Fractal Viewpoint of Tumors and Nanoparticles.']"""

PSA kinetics can be assessed as the PSA velocity, which is traditionally evaluated dichotomously and classified as abnormal if greater than either 0.35 or 0.75 ng/ml/yr. Machine learning models may provide additional benefit in assessing risk using PSA kinetics instead of PSA velocity.  Objective:   To improve the utility of PSA kinetics by constructing a generalizable, universal machine learning model.  Design, setting, and participants:   Data were obtained from the PLCO and PCPT trials and from a contemporary Australian cohort. PSA data were interpolated using a modified Gaussian process. A machine learning model based on a two-headed approach was designed, in which the multivariable input was fed into a one-dimensional ResNet18 model.  Outcome measures and statistical analysis:   The model performance was assessed compared to PSA levels and PSA velocity in terms of area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC).  Results and limitations:   A total of 10719 patients were included in the analysis. In tests on a validation set of the complete database to diagnose grade group ≥2, the AUC was 0.886 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.870-0.902) for the machine learning model, compared to 0.807 (95% CI 0.796-0.819) for PSA and 0.627 (95% CI 0.607-0.648) for PSA velocity.  Conclusions:   Machine learning models can be used to augment the diagnostic utility of PSA kinetics in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. We demonstrated significant improvements in accuracy compared to the traditional approaches of PSA velocity and PSA thresholds.

We investigated the reasons contributing to nonadherence to GnRH agonists through interviews with men with PCa and focus groups with their health care professionals.  Data sources:   The three stages of the study were validation of themes, interviews with men on GnRH agonists, and focus groups with oncology specialists and clinical nurse specialists. An experienced oncologist validated factors contributing to nonadherence identified from the literature. A total of 10 men with PCa were recruited from a large teaching hospital and were interviewed on a one-to-one basis using a topic guide. In stage three, two separate focus groups were held with oncology specialists and clinical nurse specialists treating men with PCa. The interviews and focus groups were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Initial codes identified from stage three were grouped into themes and thematically analyzed.  Conclusion:   Themes identified from the interviews and focus groups influencing adherence to treatment were side effects of treatment, patient belief system, benefits outweigh harm, quality of life over quantity of life, social support, and patient-clinician relationship. Although side effects such as hot flushes and loss of libido were sometimes overwhelming for many, these men felt that treatment benefits outweighed harm.  Implications for nursing practice:   Reasons leading to nonadherence can be multifactorial and unique to each patient.

Immediate urinary incontinence post-RP was still common and depressing without specific reason.  Methods:   A multicenter cohort of 154 consecutive patients from 2018 to 2020, who was diagnosed with localized prostate cancer underwent either modified mini-incision retropubic radical prostatectomy (Mmi-RRP) or laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) or robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Seventy-two patients with Denonvilliers' fascia (DF) spared were included in DFS (Denonvilliers' fascia sparing) group.

Continuous data and categorical data were analyzed with t-test and Chi-square test, respectively. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated with logistic regression.  Results:   Urinary continence of Group DFS was significantly better than that of Group Control at each time point within one year after operation. Incidence rate of continence in Group DFS and Group Control were 83.3% vs 13.4% (P < 0.01) for ImC, 90.3% vs 30.5% (P < 0.01) at 3 months, 91.7% vs 64.6% (P < 0.01) at 6 months, and 93.1% vs 80.5% (P = 0.02) at 1 year after operation, respectively.

Results:   In total, 1144 patients completed baseline IIEF forms and of these, 56%, 64%, and 61% completed the IIEF at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively; 1123 patients completed the FACE score at baseline and 50%, 61%, 73%, 61%, and 65% completed all 15 items for the FACE metric at timepoints of 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, respectively. Erectile dysfunction at 12 months based on the single question was not significantly different between arms (38.1% for the standard dose radiation therapy arm vs 49.7% for the dose escalated radiation therapy arm; P = .051). Treatment arm (70.2 vs 79.2) had no significant impact on any PRO metrics measured across all collected domains. Comprehensive dosimetric analyses are presented and reveal multiple significant differences to regional organs at risk.  Conclusions:   Compliance with PRO data collection was lower than anticipated in this phase 3 trial. Examining the available data, dose escalated EBRT did not appear to be associated with any detriment to PROs across numerous prospectively collected domains. These data, notwithstanding limitations, add to our understanding of the implications of EBRT dose escalation in prostate cancer. Furthermore, these results illustrate challenges associated with PRO data collection.""","""['William A Hall', 'Snehal Deshmukh', 'Deborah W Bruner', 'Jeff M Michalski', 'James A Purdy', 'Walter Bosch', 'Jean-Paul Bahary', 'Maltibehn P Patel', 'Matthew B Parliament', 'Michael I Lock', 'Harold Y Lau', 'Luis Souhami', 'Scot A Fisher', 'Young Kwok', 'Michael J Seider', 'Eric Vigneault', 'Seth A Rosenthal', 'Gary S Gustafson', 'Hiram A Gay', 'Stephanie L Pugh', 'Howard M Sandler', 'Benjamin Movsas']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['FACE Value of Patient-Reported Outcomes in Dose-Escalated Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Preliminary patient-reported outcomes analysis of 3-dimensional radiation therapy versus intensity-modulated radiation therapy on the high-dose arm of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0126 prostate cancer trial.', 'ASCENDE-RT: An Analysis of Treatment-Related Morbidity for a Randomized Trial Comparing a Low-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy Boost with a Dose-Escalated External Beam Boost for High- and Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen Suppression Combined with Elective Nodal and Dose Escalated Radiation Therapy (the ASCENDE-RT Trial): An Analysis of Survival Endpoints for a Randomized Trial Comparing a\xa0Low-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy Boost to a\xa0Dose-Escalated External Beam Boost for High- and Intermediate-risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Dose escalated external beam radiotherapy versus neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy and conventional dose external beam radiotherapy for clinically localized prostate cancer: do we need both?', 'Preliminary toxicity and prostate-specific antigen response of a Phase I/II trial of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, 103Pd brachytherapy, and three-dimensional conformal external beam irradiation in the treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Adaptive magnetic resonance image guided radiation for intact localized prostate cancer how to optimally test a rapidly emerging technology.']"""

Recently, landmark molecular features have been reported for CRPC, including the expression of constitutively active AR variants that lack the ligand-binding domain. Besides their role in CRPC, AR variants lead to the expression of genes involved in tumor progression. However, little is known about the specificity of their mode of action compared with that of wild-type AR (AR-WT). We performed AR transcriptome analyses in an androgen-dependent PCa cell line as well as cross-analyses with publicly available RNA-seq datasets and established that transcriptional repression capacity that was marked for AR-WT was pathologically lost by AR variants. Functional enrichment analyses allowed us to associate AR-WT repressive function to a panel of genes involved in cell adhesion and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. So, we postulate that a less documented AR-WT normal function in prostate epithelial cells could be the repression of a panel of genes linked to cell plasticity and that this repressive function could be pathologically abrogated by AR variants in PCa.""","""['Éva Erdmann', 'Pauline Ould Madi Berthélémy', 'Félicie Cottard', 'Charlotte Zoe Angel', 'Edwige Schreyer', 'Tao Ye', 'Bastien Morlet', 'Luc Negroni', 'Bruno Kieffer', 'Jocelyn Céraline']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mol Oncol""","""['Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Arginine vasopressin receptor 1a is a therapeutic target for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Distinct transcriptional programs mediated by the ligand-dependent full-length androgen receptor and its splice variants in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Transcript Levels of Androgen Receptor Variant 7 and Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzyme 2C in Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer and Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor functions in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance to new agents targeting the androgen axis.', 'A compendium of Androgen Receptor Variant 7 target genes and their role in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'From Omics to Multi-Omics Approaches for In-Depth Analysis of the Molecular Mechanisms of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Cancer is a leading cause of death, and the impact of the pandemic on cancer diagnoses is an important public health concern.  Methods:   This cross-sectional study retrospectively analyzed the electronic medical records of 80,138 cancer patients diagnosed between January 1, 2019, and May 31, 2021. Outcome measures included weekly number of new cancer cases and trends in weekly cancer cases, before and after the pandemic; patient demographics; and positive COVID-19 test rates.  Results:   Beginning March 4, 2020, defined as the onset of the pandemic, weekly cancer cases declined precipitously (-110.0 cases per week [95% confidence interval, -190.2 to -29.8]) for 4 weeks, followed by a moderate recovery (+23.7 cases per week [9.1 to 38.4]) of 10 weeks duration. Thereafter, weekly cancer cases trended slowly back toward pre-COVID-19 baseline levels. Following the pandemic onset, there was a cumulative year-over-year decline in cancer cases overall of 7.3%, including a 20.2%, 14.3%, and 12.8% decline in nonmelanoma skin cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer, respectively. Changes in case volumes were accompanied by variations in patient characteristics, including region, age, gender, race, insurance coverage, and COVID-19 positive test rates (P < .01 for all). Among patients tested for COVID-19, 5.3% had a positive result.  Conclusions:   The data in this study demonstrate a substantial reduction in cancer diagnoses following the onset of COVID-19, which appear to reach expected pre-COVID norms 12 months later.

We investigated the existence of interactions between the major components of this fluid: spermine, citrate and myoinositol, metal ions, including zinc, and proteins.  Materials and methods:   Solutions of 90 mM citrate, 18 mM spermine and 6 mM myo-inositol, mimicking expressed prostatic fluid, were investigated by 1H NMR using changes in T2 relaxation and chemical shift as markers for interactions.  Results and discussion:   Adding to this metabolite mixture the ions Na+ , K+, Ca++, Mg++ and Zn++, decreased the T2 relaxation times of citrate and spermine protons by factors of 3 and 2, respectively, with Zn++ causing the largest effect, indicating ion-metabolite interactions. The T2 of 18 mM spermine dropped by a factor of 2 upon addition with 90 mM citrate, but no effect on T2 was seen with myo-inositol pointing to a specific citrate-spermine interaction. Moreover, the T2 of citrate in the presence of spermine decreased by adding metal ions and increasing amounts of Zn++, indicating complexation of citrate and spermine with metal ions, particularly with Zn. The addition of bovine serum albumin (BSA), as an index protein, substantially further decreased the T2 of spermine and citrate implying the formation of a transient spermine-metal ion-citrate-BSA complex.

This subset of TAMs correlates positively with PCa progression and shorter disease-free survival and is characterized by an accumulation of lipids that is dependent on Marco. Mechanistically, cancer cell-derived IL-1β enhances Marco expression on macrophages, and reciprocally, cancer cell migration is promoted by CCL6 released by lipid-loaded TAMs. Moreover, administration of a high-fat diet to tumor-bearing mice raises the abundance of lipid-loaded TAMs. Finally, targeting lipid accumulation by Marco blockade hinders tumor growth and invasiveness and improves the efficacy of chemotherapy in models of PCa, pointing to combinatorial strategies that may influence patient outcomes.""","""['Michela Masetti#', 'Roberta Carriero#', 'Federica Portale', 'Giulia Marelli', 'Nicolò Morina', 'Marta Pandini', 'Marta Iovino', 'Bianca Partini', 'Marco Erreni', 'Andrea Ponzetta', 'Elena Magrini', 'Piergiuseppe Colombo', 'Grazia Elefante', 'Federico Simone Colombo', 'Joke M M den Haan', 'Clelia Peano', 'Javier Cibella', 'Alberto Termanini', 'Paolo Kunderfranco', 'Jolanda Brummelman', 'Matthew Wai Heng Chung', 'Massimo Lazzeri', 'Rodolfo Hurle', 'Paolo Casale', 'Enrico Lugli', 'Ronald A DePinho', 'Subhankar Mukhopadhyay', 'Siamon Gordon', 'Diletta Di Mitri']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Exp Med""","""['Targeting MARCO and IL37R on Immunosuppressive Macrophages in Lung Cancer Blocks Regulatory T Cells and Supports Cytotoxic Lymphocyte Function.', 'CCL5 derived from tumor-associated macrophages promotes prostate cancer stem cells and metastasis via activating β-catenin/STAT3 signaling.', 'Tumor-associated neutrophils and macrophages interaction contributes to intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma progression by activating STAT3.', 'Targeting tumor-associated macrophages: A potential treatment for solid tumors.', 'Lipid-loaded macrophages as new therapeutic target in cancer.', 'Advances in landscape and related therapeutic targets of the prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'Deciphering the tumour immune microenvironment cell by cell.', 'Single-cell RNA sequencing uncovers heterogeneous transcriptional signatures in tumor-infiltrated dendritic cells in prostate cancer.', 'Multi-omics analysis reveals a macrophage-related marker gene signature for prognostic prediction, immune landscape, genomic heterogeneity, and drug choices in prostate cancer.', 'TREM2 macrophages drive NK cell paucity and dysfunction in lung cancer.']"""

However, independent or synergistic associations between neighborhood and individual socioeconomic disadvantage have not been fully examined, and prior studies using simplistic neighborhood SES measures may not comprehensively assess multiple aspects of neighborhood SES.  Objective:   To investigate the associations of neighborhood SES (using a validated comprehensive composite measure) and individual SES with survival among patients with nonmetastatic common cancers.  Design, setting, and participants:   This prospective, population-based cohort study was derived from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database from January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2011, with follow-up ending on December 31, 2017. Participants included older patients (≥65 years) with breast, prostate, lung, or colorectal cancer.  Exposures:   Neighborhood SES was measured using the area deprivation index (ADI; quintiles), a validated comprehensive composite measure of neighborhood SES. Individual SES was assessed by Medicare-Medicaid dual eligibility (yes vs no), a reliable indicator for patient-level low income.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcome was overall mortality, and the secondary outcome was cancer-specific mortality. Hazard ratios (HRs) for the associations of ADI and dual eligibility with overall and cancer-specific mortality were estimated via Cox proportional hazards regression. Statistical analyses were conducted from January 23 to April 15, 2021.  Results:   A total of 96 978 patients were analyzed, including 25 968 with breast, 35 150 with prostate, 16 684 with lung, and 19 176 with colorectal cancer. Median age at diagnosis was 76 years (IQR, 71-81 years) for breast cancer, 73 years (IQR, 70-77 years) for prostate cancer, 76 years (IQR, 71-81 years) for lung cancer, and 78 years (IQR, 72-84 years) for colorectal cancer. Among lung and colorectal cancer patients, 8412 (50.4%) and 10 486 (54.7%), respectively, were female. The proportion of non-Hispanic White individuals among breast cancer patients was 83.7% (n = 21 725); prostate cancer, 76.8% (n = 27 001); lung cancer, 83.5% (n = 13 926); and colorectal cancer, 81.1% (n = 15 557). Neighborhood-level and individual-level SES were independently associated with overall mortality, and no interactions were detected. Compared with the most affluent neighborhoods (ADI quintile 1), living in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods (ADI quintile 5) was associated with higher risk of overall mortality (breast: HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.26-1.43; prostate: HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.42-1.62; lung: HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.14-1.28; and colorectal: HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.17-1.32). Individual socioeconomic disadvantage (dual eligibility) was associated with higher risk of overall mortality (breast: HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.15-1.29; prostate: HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.21-1.38; lung: HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09-1.20; and colorectal: HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.17-1.29). A similar pattern was observed for cancer-specific mortality.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this cohort study, neighborhood-level deprivation was associated with worse survival among patients with nonmetastatic breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer, even after accounting for individual SES. These findings suggest that, in order to improve cancer outcomes and reduce health disparities, policies for ongoing investments in low-resource neighborhoods and low-income households are needed.""","""['En Cheng', 'Pamela R Soulos', 'Melinda L Irwin', 'Elizabeth M Cespedes Feliciano', 'Carolyn J Presley', 'Charles S Fuchs', 'Jeffrey A Meyerhardt', 'Cary P Gross']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Neighborhood Disadvantage and Breast Cancer-Specific Survival.', 'Disparities in cancer incidence and mortality by area-level socioeconomic status: a multilevel analysis.', 'Association of Race and Area Deprivation With Breast Cancer Survival Among Black and White Women in the State of Georgia.', 'Neighborhood deprivation, racial segregation and associations with cancer risk and outcomes across the cancer-control continuum.', 'Socioeconomic status and breast cancer treatment.', 'Association of Socioeconomic Status With Long-Term Outcome in Survivors After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: Nationwide Population-Based Longitudinal Study.', 'Area Deprivation Index in Patients with Invasive Lobular Carcinoma of the Breast: Associations with Tumor Characteristics and Outcomes.', 'Neighborhood Disadvantage and Breast Cancer-Specific Survival.', 'COVID-19 vaccine uptake trends in SARS-CoV-2 previously infected cancer patients.', 'Social determinants of health impact mortality from HCC and cholangiocarcinoma: a population-based cohort study.']"""

In the report of the symptoms, 12 patients reported tiredness, and four moderate-to-severe tiredness during treatment. In the BFI, all patients reported fatigue; eight reported moderate-to-severe fatigue. The most affected BFI domain was mood: five patients reporting moderate-to-severe impact. In interviews (qualitative phase; N = 8), diverse patient experience on fatigue was observed, including apathetic feelings, affected speed and distance during the walk, negative impact on profession, housework, or driving, reduced outgoing activity, and difficulty in enjoying time with grandchildren or travel. Five out of eight patients communicated fatigue to their physicians but received diverse reactions.  Conclusion:   Patient interviews highlighted the impact of fatigue on patients' lives and difficulties in communicating fatigue to physicians. Fatigue frequency after medication may need to be monitored and its burden is considered to provide treatment that meets the needs, wishes, and circumstances of each patient. Further research is needed to elucidate how fatigue affects patients' lives, and underscore patient-physician communication difficulties.""","""['Taro Iguchi', 'Yusuke Nakamura', 'Takeshi Akiyama', 'Krishant Chand', 'Eric Yu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Curr Med Res Opin""","""['PREVALENCE OF FATIGUE AND IMPACT ON QUALITY OF LIFE IN CASTRATION-RESISTANT PROSTATE CANCER PATIENTS: the VITAL study.', 'Symptoms and Impacts in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Qualitative Findings from Patient and Physician Interviews.', 'Impact of Abiraterone Acetate plus Prednisone or Enzalutamide on Patient-reported Outcomes in Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Final 12-mo Analysis from the Observational AQUARiUS Study.', 'Conceptual assessment of HRQOL among Japanese non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) patients.', 'Incidence and Correlates of Fatigue in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.']"""

The aim of this study was to investigate any association between androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer and increased risk for IH. The study population in this population-based nested case-control study was based on data from the Prostate Cancer Database Sweden. The cohort included all men with prostate cancer who had not received curative treatment. Men who had been diagnosed or had undergone IH repair (n = 1,324) were cases and controls, where not diagnosed, nor operated on for IH, matched only on birth year (n = 13,240). Conditional multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess any temporal association between ADT and IH, adjusting for marital status, education level, prostate cancer risk category, Charlson Comorbidity Index, ADT, time since prostate cancer diagnosis, and primary prostate cancer treatment. Odds ratio (OR) for diagnosis/repair of IH 0 to 1 year from start of ADT was 0.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.38, 0.68]); between 1 and 3 years after, the OR was 0.35 (95% CI = [0.26, 0.47]); between 3 and 5 years after, the OR was 0.39 (95% CI = [0.26, 0.56]); between 5 and 7 years after, the OR was 0.6 (95% CI = [0.41, 0.97]); and >9 years after, the OR was 3.68 (95% CI = [2.45, 5.53]). The marked increase in OR for IH after 9 years of ADT supports the hypothesis that low testosterone levels increase the risk for IH. The low risk for IH during the first 8 years on ADT is likely caused by selection of men with advanced cancer unlikely to be diagnosed or treated for IH.""","""['Maria Hermann', 'Hanna Vikman', 'Pär Stattin', 'Asmatullah Katawazai', 'Ove Gustafsson', 'Johan Styrke', 'Gabriel Sandblom']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Am J Mens Health""","""['Androgen deprivation therapy and the risk of coronary heart disease and heart failure in patients with prostate cancer: a nested case-control study in UK primary care.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy and risk of acute kidney injury in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy, comorbidity, cancer stage and mortality from COVID-19 in men with prostate cancer.', 'Androgens and prostate cancer; pathogenesis and deprivation therapy.', 'Metabolic and cardiovascular effects of androgen deprivation therapy.']"""

Patients and methods:   Between November 2014 and December 2018, a total of 56 consecutive patients (median age 69.5 years; range 55-84 years) with mCRPC were included in this retrospective analysis. Patients received between 1 and 4 therapy cycles with a mean activity of 6.8 GBq per cycle. Biochemical response was evaluated using Prostate Cancer Working Group Criteria 3 (PCWG 3). Survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. This retrospective study was approved by the local ethics committee.  Results:   A total of 139 treatment cycles with Lu-177-PSMA-617 were performed. A decline of 50% or more of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level occurred in 54% and a PSA decline of any amount in 65% of patients. The estimated median overall survival (OS) was 16 months, in the chemotherapy subgroup 14 months. A longer OS was associated with a PSA-decline ≥50%, more than 2 cycles of therapy, cumulative activity >15 GBq and an initial alkaline phosphatase ≤ 220 [U/l]. These identified predictors remained significant on uni- and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Moreover, 40% of the patients who were non-responders after the first therapy cycle turned into responders after the second one.  Conclusion:   PSA-decline ≥50%, a cumulative activity >15 GBq and an initial alkaline phosphatase ≤ 220 [U/l] were identified as key predictors of prolonged OS in patients with mCRPC.

The objective was to compare AS eligibility by systematic biopsy (SB) and combined MRI-targeted (MRI-TB) and SB within real-world data using current AS guidelines.  Methods:   A retrospective multicenter study was conducted by a German prostate cancer (PCa) working group representing six tertiary referral centers and one outpatient practice. Men with PCa and at least one MRI-visible lesion according to Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) v2 were included. Twenty different AS inclusion criteria of international guidelines were applied to calculate AS eligibility using either a SB or a combined MRI-TB and SB. Reasons for AS exclusion were assessed.  Results:   Of 1941 patients with PCa, per guideline, 583-1112 patients with PCa in both MRI-TB and SB were available for analysis. Using SB, a median of 22.1% (range 6.4-72.4%) were eligible for AS. Using the combined approach, a median of 15% (range 1.7-68.3%) were eligible for AS. Addition of MRI-TB led to a 32.1% reduction of suitable patients. Besides Gleason Score upgrading, the maximum number of positive cores were the most frequent exclusion criterion. Variability in MRI and biopsy protocols potentially limit the results.  Conclusions:   Only a moderate number of patients with PCa can be monitored by AS to defer active treatment using current guidelines for inclusion in a real-world setting. By an additional MRI-TB, this number is markedly reduced.

Initial staging in intermediate- and high-risk patients with prostate cancer is important for management. In addition, PSMA uptake has been shown to have a relation with grade of disease, and thus could be considered a separate noninvasive prognostic factor. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of PSMA PET/CT in the staging and management of prostate cancer patients as well as the relation to maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax).  Methods:   The patients referred to our department for staging prostate cancer were evaluated retrospectively (n = 65). Patients were grouped as positive for lymph node or distant metastatic disease. Primary tumor SUVmax data were compared with the prognostic factors of the disease. In addition, decisions about treatment protocol before and after PSMA PET/CT imaging were noted.  Results:   All the patients except one were accepted as positive for primary tumor. Of the patients, 46.2% were positive for lymph node and 24.6% for distant metastases. After evaluation by PSMA PET/CT, the clinical choice of treatment changed for 43.1% of our patients. Primary tumor SUVmax and tumor-to-background SUVmax ratios were found to have a significant relation with D'Amico risk classification. We found a positive correlation between SUVmax and prostate-specific antigen, Gleason scores, and age.  Conclusion:   PSMA PET/CT images have a nonnegligible effect on staging, clinical decisions, and change in treatment protocol.

The present study was designed to provide a quantitative description of the occupational radiation exposure of surgery and histopathology personnel from CLI-guided robot-assisted radical prostatectomy after the injection of 68Ga-PSMA-11 in a single-injection PET/CT CLI protocol. Methods: Ten patients with preoperative 68Ga-PSMA-11 administration and intraoperative CLI were included. Patient dose rate was measured before PET/CT (n = 10) and after PET/CT (n = 5) at a 1-m distance for 4 patient regions (head [A], right side [B], left side [C], and feet [D]). Electronic personal dosimetry (EPD) was used for intraoperative occupational exposure (n = 10). Measurements included the first surgical assistant and scrub nurse at the operating table and the CLI imager/surgeon at the robotic console and encompassed the whole duration of surgery and CLI image acquisition. An estimation of the exposure of histopathology personnel was performed by measuring prostate specimens (n = 8) with a germanium detector. Results: The measured dose rate value before PET/CT was 5.3 ± 0.9 (average ± SD) μSv/h. This value corresponds to a patient-specific dose rate constant for positions B and C of 0.047 μSv/h⋅MBq. The average dose rate value after PET/CT was 1.04 ± 1.00 μSv/h. The patient-specific dose rate constant values corresponding to regions A to D were 0.011, 0.026, 0.024, and 0.003 μSv/h⋅MBq, respectively. EPD readings revealed average personal equivalent doses of 9.0 ± 7.1, 3.3 ± 3.9, and 0.7 ± 0.7 μSv for the first surgical assistant, scrub nurse, and CLI imager/surgeon, respectively. The median germanium detector-measured activity of the prostate specimen was 2.96 kBq (interquartile range, 2.23-7.65 kBq). Conclusion: Single-injection 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT CLI procedures are associated with a reasonable occupational exposure level, if kept under 110 procedures per year.

Methods: This was a 2-institution study including 245 BCR PCa patients after primary local therapy and negative results on conventional imaging. The patients underwent 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT. We tested for correlations of lesion detection rate and disease location with tumor characteristics, time from initial therapy, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and PSA doubling time (PSAdt). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine predictors of a positive scan. Regression-based coefficients were used to develop nomograms predicting scan positivity and extrapelvic disease. Results: Overall, 79.2% (194/245) of patients had a positive 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT result, with detection rates of 48.2% (27/56), 74.3% (26/35), 84% (37/44), 96.7% (59/61), and 91.8% (45/49) for PSAs of <0.5, 0.5 to <1.0, 1.0 to <2.0, 2.0 to <5.0, and ≥5.0 ng/mL, respectively. Patients with lesions confined to the pelvis had lower PSAs than those with distant sites (1.6 ± 3.5 vs. 3.0 ± 6.3 ng/mL, P < 0.001). In patients treated with prostatectomy (n = 195), 24.1% (47/195) had a negative scan result, 46.1% (90/195) showed intrapelvic disease, and 29.7% (58/195) showed extrapelvic disease. In the postradiation subgroup (n = 50), 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT was always negative at a PSA lower than 1.0 ng/mL and extrapelvic disease was seen only when PSA was greater than 2.0 ng/mL. At multivariate analysis, PSA and PSAdt were independent predictive factors of scan positivity and the presence of extrapelvic disease in postsurgical patients, with area under the curve of 78% and 76%, respectively. PSA and PSAdt were independent predictors of the presence of extrapelvic disease in the postradiation cohort, with area under the curve of 85%. Time from treatment to scan was significantly longer for prostatectomy-bed-only recurrences than for those with bone or visceral disease (6.2 ± 6.4 vs. 2.4 ± 1.3 y, P < 0.001). Conclusion:18F-DCFPyL PET/CT offers high detection rates in BCR PCa patients. PSA and PSAdt are able to predict scan positivity and disease location.

Methods:   Whole-genome chip data GSE6919 of prostate cancer study were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA), and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using R software. WGCNA was performed to construct a gene co-expression network for screening the key genes. TCGA database was used to explore the expressions of the DEGs and their association with the prognosis. To validate the results, we designed siRNA fragments targeting the metastasis-related gene HNRNPA2B1, and observed its effect on growth, apoptosis, clone formation, migration and invasion of prostate cancer cell lines using MTT assay, flow cytometry, clone formation assay, and Transwell assay.  Results:   PCA analysis showed obvious clustering of significant DEGs in metastatic cancer group. The modules obtained by WGCNA analysis in metastasis group involved stem cell differentiation, amino acid metabolism and immune response. Further screening of the genes identified 3 genes related with prostate cancer occurrence (BDH1, PAK4 and EXTL3) and another 3 with prostate cancer metastasis (NKTR, CTBP2 and HNRNPA2B1), which were shown to have differential expressions in TCGA database and were correlated with the patient's overall survival. In the cell experiment, PC3 and LNCap cells transfected with the siRNA fragment targeting HNRNPA2B1 showed obvious growth inhibition with increased cell apoptosis, lowered clone formation ability, and suppressed capacities for migration and invasion.  Conclusion:   We identified 3 hub genes related with the occurrence (BDH1, PAK4 and EXTL3) and another 3 with metastasis of prostate cancer (NKTR, CTBP2 and HNRNPA2B1) using WGCNA, which provides a new approach for studying the regulatory mechanisms of prostate cancer.""","""['H Zhang', 'N Chen', 'X Wang', 'B Gao', 'M Ling', 'G Chen', 'Z Wu', 'Y Li', 'W Zhong', 'B Pan']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao""","""['Identification of castration-resistant prostate cancer-related hub genes using weighted gene co-expression network analysis.', 'Identification of key genes and multiple molecular pathways of metastatic process in prostate cancer.', 'Co-expression modules construction by WGCNA and identify potential hub genes and regulation pathways of postpartum depression.', 'Bioinformatics analysis identified hub genes in prostate cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis.', 'Identification of hub genes in prostate cancer using robust rank aggregation and weighted gene co-expression network analysis.']"""

However, there are sparse clinical data on host-tumor immune modification by first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. This study investigated the association between response to first-line gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) or carboplatin (GCarbo) chemotherapy and response to subsequent pembrolizumab treatment.  Patients and methods:   A multicenter-derived database registered 454 patients diagnosed with aUC between 2008 and 2020. Of these, 108 patients who received first-line GC or GCarbo followed by second-line or later pembrolizumab were eligible for investigation and were classified into 3 groups: 48 receiving full-dose GC, 21 receiving dose-reduced GC, and 39 receiving GCarbo. Overall survival (OS) was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Possible factors associated with the response to pembrolizumab were evaluated using binary logistic regression methods.  Results:   The rate of patients undergoing surgical removal of the primary organ was higher and creatinine clearance was lower in the dose-reduced GC and GCarbo groups than in the full-dose GC groups. Pembrolizumab responders had significantly better survival benefits than nonresponders. The rate of pembrolizumab responders was much higher in first-line chemotherapy responders than in first-line chemotherapy nonresponders. In contrast to the full-dose GC and GCarbo groups, the pembrolizumab responder rate was lower, and no association was observed between response to first-line chemotherapy and response to pembrolizumab in the dose-reduced GC group.  Conclusion:   Cisplatin and carboplatin may play an important role in the antitumor immune response, which could impact the outcome of subsequent pembrolizumab treatment. Given that the rate of response to pembrolizumab after dose-reduced GC chemotherapy was relatively low, this regimen is not recommended for cis-unfit patients with aUC. Further studies are required to understand the mechanisms responsible for the cross-reactivity of platinum and immune checkpoint inhibitors.""","""['Makito Miyake', 'Takuto Shimizu', 'Nobutaka Nishimura', 'Keisuke Kiba', 'Fumisato Maesaka', 'Yuki Oda', 'Akira Tachibana', 'Mitsuru Tomizawa', 'Chihiro Ohmori', 'Yoshiaki Matsumura', 'Kazuki Ichikawa', 'Shinichiro Mizobuchi', 'Takanosuke Yoshikawa', 'Shunta Hori', 'Yosuke Morizawa', 'Daisuke Gotoh', 'Yasushi Nakai', 'Satoshi Anai', 'Kazumasa Torimoto', 'Katsuya Aoki', 'Nobumichi Tanaka', 'Kiyohide Fujimoto;Nara Urological Research and Treatment Group']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Gemcitabine Plus Cisplatin Split Versus Gemcitabine Plus Carboplatin for Advanced Urothelial Cancer With Cisplatin-unfit Renal Function.', 'Pembrolizumab alone or combined with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy as first-line therapy for advanced urothelial carcinoma (KEYNOTE-361): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial.', 'Cost-effectiveness of Pembrolizumab for Patients with Advanced, Unresectable, or Metastatic Urothelial Cancer Ineligible for Cisplatin-based Therapy.', 'Gemcitabine for unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer.', 'Gemcitabine chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic bladder carcinoma.', 'Probiotics enhances anti-tumor immune response induced by gemcitabine plus cisplatin chemotherapy for urothelial cancer.', 'Comparison of full-dose gemcitabine/cisplatin, dose-reduced gemcitabine/cisplatin, and gemcitabine/carboplatin in real-world patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma.', 'Efficacy of pembrolizumab rechallenge for metastatic urothelial carcinoma.', 'First-line pembrolizumab for patients with early relapsing urothelial carcinoma after perioperative chemotherapy: a retrospective analysis of bladder cancer and upper urinary tract cancer.', 'Organ-Specific and Mixed Responses to Pembrolizumab in Patients with Unresectable or Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma: A Multicenter Retrospective Study.']"""

Objective:   To assess the relationships between PSA kinetics, outcomes, and molecular subtypes in SPARTAN.  Design, setting, and participants:   The authors conducted a post hoc analysis of nmCRPC patients randomized to receive apalutamide (n = 806) or placebo (n = 401) plus ADT and a subset stratified by molecular classifiers.  Intervention:   Apalutamide 240 mg/d.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The association between PSA kinetics and MFS, OS, time to PSA progression, and molecular subtypes was evaluated using the landmark analysis and Kaplan-Meier methods.  Results and limitations:   By 3 mo, PSA decreased in most apalutamide-treated patients and increased in most placebo-treated patients. After apalutamide, the median time to PSA nadir, confirmed ≥50% PSA reduction, ≥90% PSA reduction, and PSA ≤0.2 ng/ml were 7.4, 1.0, 1.9, and 2.8 mo, respectively. By 6 mo, 90%, 57%, and 32% of apalutamide patients had ≥50% PSA reduction, ≥90% PSA reduction, and PSA ≤0.2 ng/ml, respectively, while only 1.5% of placebo patients experienced ≥50% PSA reduction. PSA reductions were observed within 3 mo and up to 12 mo of apalutamide treatment, and were similar across molecular subtypes. Deep PSA responses (≥90% PSA reduction or PSA ≤0.2 ng/ml) at landmark 6-mo apalutamide treatment were significantly associated with improved time to PSA progression (hazard ratio {HR} [95% confidence interval {CI}] 0.25 [0.18-0.33] or 0.13 [0.08-0.21]), MFS (0.41 [0.29-0.57] or 0.3 [0.19-0.47]), and OS (0.45 [0.35-0.59] or 0.26 [0.18-0.38]; p < 0.001 for all).  Conclusions:   Apalutamide plus ADT produced rapid, deep, and durable PSA responses by 6-mo treatment regardless of assessed molecular prognostic markers. An early PSA response with apalutamide was associated with clinical benefits, supporting prognostic value of PSA monitoring.  Patient summary:   In this report, we describe how prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels relate to outcomes in patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with apalutamide plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to obtain less confounded estimates of BP on total and site-specific cancers.  Methods:   We applied replicated genetic instruments for systolic and diastolic BP to summary genetic associations with total cancer (37387 cases, 367856 non-cases) from the UK Biobank, and 17 site-specific cancers (663-17881 cases) from a meta-analysis of the UK Biobank and the Kaiser Permanente Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging. We used inverse-variance weighting with multiplicative random effects as the main analysis, and sensitivity analyses including the weighted median, MR-Egger and multivariable MR adjusted for body mass index and for smoking. For validation, we included breast (Breast Cancer Association Consortium: 133384 cases, 113789 non-cases), prostate (Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome Consortium: 79194 cases, 61112 non-cases) and lung (International Lung and Cancer Consortium: 10246 cases, 38295 non-cases) cancer from large consortia. We used asthma as a negative control outcome.  Results:   Systolic and diastolic BP were unrelated to total cancer (OR 0.98 per standard deviation higher [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89, 1.07] and OR 1.00 [95% CI 0.92, 1.08]) and to site-specific cancers after accounting for multiple testing, with consistent findings from consortia. BP was nominally associated with melanoma and possibly kidney cancer, and as expected, not associated with asthma. Sensitivity analyses using other MR methods gave similar results.  Conclusions:   In contrast to previous observational evidence, BP does not appear to be a risk factor for cancer, although an effect on melanoma and kidney cancer cannot be excluded.

The power of the log-rank test depends on the behavior of the hazard ratio of the treatment arm to the control arm. Under the assumption of proportional hazards, the log-rank test is asymptotically fully efficient. However, this proportionality assumption does not hold true if there is a delayed treatment effect. Cancer immunology has evolved over time and several cancer vaccines are available in the market for treating existing cancers. This includes sipuleucel-T for metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer, nivolumab for metastatic melanoma, and pembrolizumab for advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer. As cancer vaccines require some time to elicit an immune response, a delayed treatment effect is observed, resulting in a violation of the proportional hazards assumption. Thus, the traditional log-rank test may not be optimal for testing immuno-oncology drugs in randomized clinical trials. Moreover, the new immuno-oncology compounds have been shown to be very effective in prolonging overall survival. Therefore, it is desirable to implement a group sequential design with the possibility of early stopping for overwhelming efficacy. In this paper, we investigate the max-combo test, which utilizes the maximum of two weighted log-rank statistics, as a robust alternative to the log-rank test. The new test is implemented for two-stage designs with possible early stopping at the interim analysis time point. Two classes of weights are investigated for the max-combo test: the Fleming and Harrington (1981) Gρ,γ$G^{\rho , \gamma }$ weights and the Magirr and Burman (2019) modest (τ∗)$ (\tau ^{*})$ weights.""","""['Pranab Ghosh', 'Robin Ristl', 'Franz König', 'Martin Posch', 'Christopher Jennison', 'Heiko Götte', 'Armin Schüler', 'Cyrus Mehta']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biom J""","""['Group sequential monitoring based on the maximum of weighted log-rank statistics with the Fleming-Harrington class of weights in oncology clinical trials.', 'Group sequential monitoring based on the weighted log-rank test statistic with the Fleming-Harrington class of weights in cancer vaccine studies.', 'Properties of the weighted log-rank test in the design of confirmatory studies with delayed effects.', 'Quantifying treatment differences in confirmatory trials under non-proportional hazards.', 'Critical review of oncology clinical trial design under non-proportional hazards.']"""

We used a case-cohort design embedded in the EPIC-Heidelberg cohort, including a subcohort of 3792 participants along with 4867 incident cases of cancer and CVD. Hazard ratios (HRs) were computed and the strongest associations were used to build weighted multi-marker combinations, and their associations with cancer and CVD risks were tested. After adjusting for common confounders, we observed direct associations of GDF-15 with lung cancer risk, NT-proBNP with breast, prostate and colorectal cancers, HbA1C with lung, colorectal, and breast cancer risks, and CRP with lung and colorectal cancer risks. An inverse association was observed for GDF-15 and prostate cancer risk. We also found direct associations of all 5 markers with myocardial infarction (MI) risk, and of GDF-15, NT-proBNP, CRP and cystatin-C with stroke risk. A combination of the independently-associated markers showed a moderately strong association with the risks of cancer and CVD (HRQ4-Q1 ranged from 1.78[1.36, 2.34] for breast cancer, when combining NT-proBNP and HbA1C, to 2.87[2.15, 3.83] for MI when combining NT-proBNP, HbA1C, CRP and cystatin-C).

Extensive computational analysis has identified a high degree of association between the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) H19 and NEPC, with the longest isoform highly expressed in NEPC. H19 regulates PCa lineage plasticity by driving a bidirectional cell identity of NE phenotype (H19 overexpression) or luminal phenotype (H19 knockdown). It contributes to treatment resistance, with the knockdown of H19 re-sensitizing PCa to ADT. It is also essential for the proliferation and invasion of NEPC. H19 levels are negatively regulated by androgen signaling via androgen receptor (AR). When androgen is absent SOX2 levels increase, driving H19 transcription and facilitating transdifferentiation. H19 facilitates the PRC2 complex in regulating methylation changes at H3K27me3/H3K4me3 histone sites of AR-driven and NEPC-related genes. Additionally, this lncRNA induces alterations in genome-wide DNA methylation on CpG sites, further regulating genes associated with the NEPC phenotype. Our clinical data identify H19 as a candidate diagnostic marker and predictive marker of NEPC with elevated H19 levels associated with an increased probability of biochemical recurrence and metastatic disease in patients receiving ADT. Here we report H19 as an early upstream regulator of cell fate, plasticity, and treatment resistance in NEPC that can reverse/transform cells to a treatable form of PCa once therapeutically deactivated.""","""['Neha Singh#', 'Varune R Ramnarine#', 'Jin H Song', 'Ritu Pandey', 'Sathish K R Padi', 'Mannan Nouri', 'Virginie Olive', 'Maxim Kobelev', 'Koichi Okumura', 'David McCarthy', 'Michelle M Hanna', 'Piali Mukherjee', 'Belinda Sun', 'Benjamin R Lee', 'J Brandon Parker', 'Debabrata Chakravarti', 'Noel A Warfel', 'Muhan Zhou', 'Jeremiah J Bearss', 'Ewan A Gibb', 'Mohammed Alshalalfa', 'R Jefferey Karnes', 'Eric J Small', 'Rahul Aggarwal', 'Felix Feng', 'Yuzhuo Wang', 'Ralph Buttyan', 'Amina Zoubeidi', 'Mark Rubin', 'Martin Gleave', 'Frank J Slack', 'Elai Davicioni', 'Himisha Beltran', 'Colin Collins', 'Andrew S Kraft']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Nat Commun""","""['Uro-Science.', 'PIM protein kinases regulate the level of the long noncoding RNA H19 to control stem cell gene transcription and modulate tumor growth.', 'BET Bromodomain Inhibition Blocks an AR-Repressed, E2F1-Activated Treatment-Emergent Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer Lineage Plasticity Program.', 'Infiltrating mast cells enhance prostate cancer invasion via altering LncRNA-HOTAIR/PRC2-androgen receptor (AR)-MMP9 signals and increased stem/progenitor cell population.', 'The Role of Epigenetic Change in Therapy-Induced Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer Lineage Plasticity.', 'Molecular model for neuroendocrine prostate cancer progression.', 'Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) H19: An essential developmental regulator with expanding roles in cancer, stem cell differentiation, and metabolic diseases.', 'Structural and molecular changes in the rat myocardium following perfluoroctane sulfonate (PFOS) exposure are mitigated by quercetin via modulating HSP 70 and SERCA 2.', 'Annotation-efficient training of medical image segmentation network based on scribble guidance in difficult areas.', 'Which Factors Influence Healthy Aging?

Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) plays an important role in repair to DNA damage, being associated with resistance to tumor cell death. Conversely, Caspase-3 is a crucial mediator of programmed cell death, being highly expressed in apoptotic cells. The aim of the present study was to characterize the expression of PARP and Caspase-3 by immunohistochemistry in patients with advanced prostate cancer. PARP and Caspase-3 were independently correlated to patients' evolution, in accordance with the classification of prognostic groups. The increase in PARP expression was positively correlated with tumor patients with poor prognosis (P < 0.0001). In contrast, a decrease in Caspase-3 expression was identified in patients with poor prognosis, when compared with prostate cancer patients with good prognosis (P = 0.0007). Numerically, 92.3% of patients previously classified with poor prognosis showed higher PARP expression, while 93.75% of patients previously classified with good prognosis showed higher levels of Caspase-3.

Although studies have shown that overexpression of PLK4 promotes CA, the effect of tumor microenvironment on polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) regulation is understudied. The aim of this study was to examine the role of hypoxia in promoting CA via PLK4. We found that hypoxia induced CA via hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF1α). We quantified the prevalence of CA in tumor cell lines and tissue sections from breast cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), colorectal cancer, and prostate cancer and found that CA was prevalent in cells with increased HIF1α levels under normoxic conditions. HIF1α levels were correlated with the extent of CA and PLK4 expression in clinical samples. We analyzed the correlation between PLK4 and HIF1A mRNA levels in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets to evaluate the role of PLK4 and HIF1α in breast cancer and PDAC prognosis. High HIF1A and PLK4 levels in patients with breast cancer and PDAC were associated with poor overall survival. We confirmed PLK4 as a transcriptional target of HIF1α and demonstrated that in PLK4 knockdown cells, hypoxia-mimicking agents did not affect CA and expression of CA-associated proteins, underscoring the necessity of PLK4 in HIF1α-related CA. To further dissect the HIF1α-PLK4 interplay, we used HIF1α-deficient cells overexpressing PLK4 and showed a significant increase in CA compared with HIF1α-deficient cells harboring wild-type PLK4. These findings suggest that HIF1α induces CA by directly upregulating PLK4 and could help us risk-stratify patients and design new therapies for CA-rich cancers.

Objective:   To perform external validation of the original nomogram in a multicentric setting.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 1639 patients who underwent PSMA-PET for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) relapse after radical therapy were retrospectively included from six high-volume PET centers. The external cohort was stratified according to clinical setting categories: group 1: first-time biochemical recurrence (n = 774); group 2: PSA relapse after salvage therapy (n = 499); group-3: biochemical persistence after radical prostatectomy (n = 210); and group-4: advanced-stage PCa before second-line systemic therapies (n = 124).  Intervention:   PSMA-PET in recurrent PCa.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   PSMA-PET detection rate was assessed in the overall population and in each subgroup. A multivariable logistic regression model was produced to evaluate the predictors of a positive scan. The performance characteristics of the model were assessed by quantifying the predictive accuracy (PA) according to model calibration. The Youden's index was used to find the best nomogram's cutoff. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was implemented to quantify the nomogram's clinical net benefit.  Results and limitations:   In the external cohort, the overall detection rate was 53.8% versus 51.2% in the original population. At multivariate analysis, International Society of Urological Pathology grade group, PSA, PSA doubling time, and clinical setting were independent predictors of a positive scan (all p ≤ 0.02). The PA of the nomogram was identical to the original model (82.0%); the model showed an optimal calibration curve. The best nomogram's cutoff was 55%. In the DCA, the nomogram revealed clinical net benefit when the threshold nomogram probabilities were ≥20%. The retrospective design is a major limitation.  Conclusions:   The original nomogram exhibited excellent characteristics on external validation. The incidence of a false negative scan can be reduced if PSMA-PET is performed when the predicted probability is ≥20%.

A single-center retrospective study""","""Introduction:   Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, accounting for 15% of all diagnosed cancers and is the sixth leading cause of cancerrelated deaths amongst men worldwide. Abiraterone and enzalutamide were the first two novel hormonal agents approved for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer but there is a lack of quality evidence regarding which is associated with better outcomes and who would benefit the most with one or another of these drugs.  Objective:   To evaluate the clinical outcomes of real-world patients submitted to treatment with novel hormonal agents, enzalutamide and abiraterone, for castration resistant metastatic prostate cancer in an academic center.  Patients and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed patients treated for castration-resistant prostate cancer with either abiraterone or enzulatamide between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2019. The primary endpoints were biochemical response, biochemical progression, radiological progression, clinical deterioration (attributed to disease progression) and death.  Results:   Enzalutamide had a higher biochemical response rate than abiraterone in patients with mCRPC (77.1% vs 58.1%, p = 0.016). Achieving a biochemical response was associated with a lower risk of biochemical progression (OR: 0.248, p = 0.017) and death (OR: 0.302, p = 0.038).  Conclusions:   Enzalutamide conferred higher biochemical response rate than abiraterone in patients with mCRPC. Despite the trend to better performance of other endpoints in the enzalutamide group, it did not achieve statistical significance. Well-designed prospective studies are needed to elucidate the comparative efficacies of these agents.""","""['Roberto Saldanha Jarimba', 'Miguel Nobre Eliseu', 'João Pedroso Lima', 'Vasco Quaresma', 'Pedro Moreira', 'Pedro Coelho Nunes', 'Edgar Tavares da Silva', 'Arnaldo José Figueiredo']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Arch Ital Urol Androl""","""['Economic Outcomes in Patients with Chemotherapy-Naïve Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Treated with Enzalutamide or Abiraterone Acetate Plus Prednisone.', 'Antitumour Activity and Safety of Enzalutamide in Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Previously Treated with Abiraterone Acetate Plus Prednisone for ≥24 weeks in Europe.', 'Clinical Outcomes from Androgen Signaling-directed Therapy after Treatment with Abiraterone Acetate and Prednisone in Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Post Hoc Analysis of COU-AA-302.', 'Indirect comparison between abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: targeting the mechanisms of resistance to abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide.', 'A scoping review protocol to elucidate outcomes following abiraterone versus enzalutamide for prostate cancer.', 'Outcomes Following Abiraterone versus Enzalutamide for Prostate Cancer: A Scoping Review.']"""

It enabled quick access to a urologist for patients presented to family physician with elevated PSA and allowed fast multidisciplinary patient care. We aim to document our data over 2 years in comparison to data before implementation of DAP and its impact on the degree of adherence to Canadian guidelines.  Methods:   From April 2016 to April 2020, 880 patients who were evaluated for prostate cancer at Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre (TBRHSC) were included in this study. Patients' characteristics, clinical data, waiting times and line of treatment before and after implementation of DAP were calculated and statistically analysed.  Results:   The median waiting time to urology consultation was significantly reduced from 68 (IQR 27-168) days to 34 (23-44) days (p < 0.001). The time from patient's referral to prostate biopsy decreased substantially from 34 (20-66) days to 18(11- 25) days after DAP (p < 0.001). After DAP, the percentage of Gleason 6 detected prostate cancers were significantly increased (19.7% to 30%) (p = 0.02). After DAP, rate for intermediate-risk patients elected for external beam radiotherapy (from 53.5% to 57.9%, p = 0.53) and radical prostatectomy (from 34.5% to 39.4%, p = 0.47) increased. More compliance to Canadian guidelines was observed in intermediate risk patients (88% vs 97.3%, p =.008).

Results:   Out of 43 eligible patients, 46.5% had a significant rise in follow up PSA. DRE was initially suspicious in 27.9% of patients, and none had any change in DRE on follow up. Initially, prostate MRIs showed PIRADS 3, 4, and 5 in 14%, 37.2%, and 11.6% respectively, while 23.2% had a negative initial MRI. 14% did not have an MRI. Upon follow up, 18.6% of patients had progression on MRI. Initial biopsies revealed that 86% were classified as WHO group 1, while 14% as WHO group 2. With regards to the follow up biopsies, 11.6% were upgraded. 20.9% of our patients had active treatment; 44.4% due to upgraded biopsy results, 22.2% due to PSA progression, 22.2% due to strong patient preference, and 11.1% due to radiologic progression.

Due to the conflicting results reported in the literature, it is not yet known at what PSA threshold 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT could reliably demonstrate the presence of recurring disease. We explored the association between 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT positivity and prescan PSA, PSA doubling time, and PSA velocity in patients with biochemical recurrence (BCR) of PCa after curative-intent treatment.  Methods:   Data from 59 patients who underwent 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT for BCR after radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy were retrieved from a single institution database. Patients already undergone salvage treatments at the time of PET/CT, with newly diagnosed PCa or with initial diagnosis of metastatic PCa were excluded. A 2-sided independent samples Bayesian t test and Bayesian Mann-Whitney U test were used to assess the association between PET/CT and prescan PSA, PSA doubling time, and PSA velocity.  Results:   Evidence for no difference between PET/CT-positive and -negative patients for log-transformed PSA was found (BF01 3.61, % error: 0.01). Robustness check and sequential analysis showed stability across a wide range of prior distribution specifications. The hypothesis of no difference in terms of PSA-dt and for PSA-vel between groups was found to be more likely compared to the alternative hypothesis (BF01 of 3.44 and 3.48, respectively).  Conclusion:   PSA and PSA kinetics are unlikely to be associated with 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT positivity in patients with BCR, and none of these serum biomarkers might be used as single predictors of PET/CT detection.

To this purpose, a detailed geometric Monte Carlo (MC) modeling of the LINAC Varian 2100C combined with a computational whole-body phantom was carried out. The neutron equivalent doses were calculated in-field and out-of field of patient's organs using the phase-space method. The obtained neutron equivalent doses were used to estimate the Lifetime Attributable Risks (LARs) for cancer incidence in out of field organs. LARs was evaluated assuming Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation VII (BEIR VII) risk model for exposure age in the range 35-70 years, according to the interval's age of treated patients in Algeria. The baselines cancer risks and survival data were associated with the statistical data for the Algerian population. The results showed that the neutrons equivalent doses per prescribed dose (Photon Dose) mostly depend on the distance of organs from the treated volume. The highest and lowest equivalent doses of 1.18 mSv/Gy and 0.25 mSv/Gy were recorded in the bladder and heart, respectively. The highest estimated lifetime attributable risk per 100,000 population was found for 35 yrs' exposure age in colon 49.94, lung 16.63 and stomach 11.17. The lowest risks were found for 70 yrs' age, in spine 0.06 and thyroid 0.14. The results showed that LARs values decrease with the increase of the exposure age and cancer incidence risk is lower than the baseline cancer risk incidence for all organs.

Totally, 137 upregulated and 55 downregulated exosomal proteins were identified from RelB-knockdown DU145 cells by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. UALCAN, GeneMANIA and tissue microarray analysis revealed that intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1) was positively related to and co-expressed with RelB in PC. Luciferase reporter assay revealed that RelB bound directly to the promoter of ICAM1. ICAM1 overexpression enhanced the migration and invasion abilities of DU145 cells. Exposure to exosomes derived from ICAM1 overexpressing cells (hICAM1-exo) strengthened the aggressiveness of RelB-knockdown cells, especially the migration and invasion capabilities. Mechanistically, the expression of ICAM1, Integrin β1, MMP9 and uPA were upregulated in RelB-knockdown cells upon hICAM1-exo treatment.

However, the role of FcγRIIIa in prostate cancer (PCa) progression remained unknown. In this study, we found that FcγRIIIa expression was present in PCa cells and its level was significantly higher in metastatic lesions than in primary tumors from the PCa cohort (P = 0.006). PCa patients with an elevated level of FcγRIIIa expression had poorer biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival compared with those with lower FcγRIIIa expression, suggesting that FcγRIIIa is of clinical importance in PCa. We demonstrated that overexpression of FcγRIIIa increased the proliferative ability of PCa cell line C4-2 cells, which was accompanied by the upregulation of androgen receptor (AR) and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase alpha (PIP5Kα), which are the key players in controlling PCa progression. Conversely, targeted inhibition of FcγRIIIa via siRNA-mediated knockdown or using its inhibitory antibody suppressed growth of xenograft PC-3 and PC-3M prostate tumors and reduced distant metastasis in xenograft mouse models. We further showed that elevated expression of AR enhanced FcγRIIIa expression, whereas inhibition of AR activity using enzalutamide led to a significant downregulation of FcγRIIIa protein expression. Similarly, inhibition of PIP5K1α decreased FcγRIIIa expression in PCa cells. FcγRIIIa physically interacted with PIP5K1α and AR via formation of protein-protein complexes, suggesting that FcγRIIIa is functionally associated with AR and PIP5K1α in PCa cells. Our study identified FcγRIIIa as an important factor in promoting PCa growth and invasion. Further, the elevated activation of FcγRIII and AR and PIP5K1α pathways may cooperatively promote PCa growth and invasion.

Moreover, we provide the first human 89Zr-PSMA-617 images.  Materials and methods:   PSMA ligands were labeled with 50-55 MBq [89Zr]ZrCl4 using a two-step labeling protocol. For biodistribution, BALB/c nude mice bearing PSMA+ and PSMA- xenografts received 0.6 µg (0.6-1 MBq) of 89Zr-PSMA-617, 89Zr-PSMA-I&T, 177Lu-PSMA-617, or 177Lu-PSMA-I&T intravenously.

Purpose To analyze how staging discordances between MRI and histopathologic evaluation relate to recurrence and survival after radical prostatectomy. Materials and Methods Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant retrospective analysis of preprostatectomy T2-weighted prostate MRI (January 2001 to December 2006). Extraprostatic extension and seminal vesicle invasion were assessed by using five-point Likert scales; scores of 4 or higher were classified as positive. Biochemical recurrence (BCR), metastases, and prostate cancer-specific mortality rates were estimated with Kaplan-Meier and Cox models. Results A total of 2160 patients (median age, 60 years; interquartile range, 55-64 years) were evaluated. Among patients with histopathologic extraprostatic (pT3) disease (683 of 2160; 32%), those with organ-confined disease at MRI (384 of 683; 56%) experienced better outcomes than those with concordant extraprostatic disease at MRI and pathologic analysis: 15-year risk for BCR, 30% (95% CI: 22, 40) versus 68% (95% CI: 60, 75); risk for metastases, 14% (95% CI: 8.4, 24) versus 32% (95% CI: 26, 39); risk for prostate cancer-specific mortality, 3% (95% CI: 1, 6) versus 15% (95% CI: 9.5, 23) (P < .001 for all comparisons). Among patients with histopathologic organ-confined disease (pT2) (1477 of 2160; 68%), those with extraprostatic disease at MRI (102 of 1477; 7%) were at higher risk for BCR (27% [95% CI: 19, 37] vs 10% [95% CI: 8, 14]; P < .001), metastases (19% [95% CI: 6, 48] vs 3% [95% CI: 1, 6]; P < .001), and prostate cancer-specific mortality (2% [95% CI: 1, 9] vs 1% [95% CI: 0, 5]; P = .009) than those with concordant organ-confined disease at MRI and pathologic analysis. At multivariable analyses, tumor extent at MRI (hazard ratio range, 4.1-5.2) and histopathologic evaluation (hazard ratio range, 3.6-6.7) was associated with the risk for BCR, metastases, and prostate cancer-specific mortality (P < .001 for all analyses). Conclusion The local extent of prostate cancer at MRI is associated with oncologic outcomes after prostatectomy, independent of pathologic tumor stage. This might inform a strategy on how to integrate MRI into a clinical staging algorithm. © RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

Patients and Methods: Twenty-eight consecutive men with prostate cancer underwent SP-rsRARP by one of two surgeons (J.B., S.C.). Data for perioperative, pathologic, and functional outcomes were collected prospectively and retrospectively analyzed. Results: Mean (standard deviation) follow-up was 6 (3) months. Mean age was 65.3 years old with an average body mass index of 25.2 kg/m2. Mean preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 10.2 ng/mL. Average prostate weight was 42 g. Three patients (11%) had prior radiation to the prostate. There were no intraoperative complications or conversions of technique. Lymphadenectomy was performed in 24 (86%) patients and nerve sparing in 14 (46%) patients. Mean operative time (skin to skin) was 234 minutes with an average estimated blood loss of 148 mL. Length of hospital stay averaged 23 hours. Seventeen (61%) of the patients did not require opioids for postoperative pain. Two Clavien Grade IIIa complications occurred (lymphocele aspiration and dilation of bladder neck contracture). Pathologic grade group was group 1 (0%), group 2 (57%), group 3 (29%), and group 4-5 (14%). Pathologic stage was T2 (15/28, 54%) and T3a,b (13/28, 46%). Five patients (18%) had a positive surgical margin, four (80%) of whom had T3 disease. One patient (4%) had a detectable PSA during follow-up and opted for adjuvant radiation. Twenty-three patients (82%) were continent at foley removal. Postoperative mean sexual health inventory for men score in those who underwent nerve sparing was 18 at 3 months follow-up. Conclusions: SP-rsRARP appears safe and feasible. Early continence rates are promising.

Accurate assessment of tumor aggressiveness guides recruitment to AS programs to avoid conservative treatment of intermediate and higher risk patients. Nevertheless, underestimating the disease risk may occur in some patients recruited, with biopsy upgrading and the concomitant potential for delayed treatment.  Aim:   To evaluate the accuracy of mpMRI and GPS for the prediction of biopsy upgrading during active surveillance (AS) management of prostate cancer (PCa).  Method:   A retrospective analysis was performed on 144 patients recruited to AS from October 2013 to December 2020. Median follow was 4.8 (IQR 3.6, 6.3) years. Upgrading was defined as upgrading to biopsy grade group ≥2 on follow up biopsies. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to investigate the effect of PSA density (PSAD), baseline Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) v2.1 score and GPS on upgrading. Time-to-event outcome, defined as upgrading, was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test.  Results:   Overall rate of upgrading was 31.9% (n = 46). PSAD was higher in the patients who were upgraded (0.12 vs. 0.08 ng/ml2 , p = .005), while no significant difference was present for median GPS in the overall cohort (overall median GPS 21; 22 upgrading vs. 20 no upgrading, p = .2044). On univariable cox proportional hazard regression analysis, the factors associated with increased risk of biopsy upgrading were PSA (HR = 1.30, CI 1.16-1.47, p = <.0001), PSAD (HR = 1.08, CI 1.05-1.12, p = <.0001) and higher PI-RADS score (HR = 3.51, CI 1.56-7.91, p = .0024). On multivariable cox proportional hazard regression analysis, only PSAD (HR = 1.10, CI 1.06-1.14, p = <.001) and high PI-RADS score (HR = 4.11, CI 1.79-9.44, p = .0009) were associated with upgrading. A cox regression model combining these three clinical features (PSAD ≥0.15 ng/ml2 at baseline, PI-RADS Score and GPS) yielded a concordance index of 0.71 for the prediction of upgrading.  Conclusion:   In this study PSAD has higher accuracy over baseline PI-RADS score and GPS score for the prediction of PCa upgrading during AS.

Methods:   Two hundred and seventy-four patients were analyzed, extracted from an institutional database. Detection rates of any PCa and clinically significant (CS) PCa for different reduced biopsy protocols were compared by using Fisher's exact test.  Results:   In total, 12-core SB revealed PCa in 103 (37.6%) men. Detection rates of reduced biopsy protocols were 74 (27%, 6-core) and 82 (29.9%, 8-core). Regarding CSPCa, 12-core SB revealed a detection rate of 26 (9.5%). Reduced biopsy protocols detected less CSPCa: 15 (5.5%) and 18 (6.6%), respectively. All differences were statistically significant, p < 0.05. PSA density ≥0.15 did not help to filter out men in whom a reduced biopsy may be sufficient.  Conclusions:   Twelve-core SB still has the highest detection rate of any PCa and CSPCa compared to reduced biopsy protocols. If the investigator and patient agree - based on individual risk calculation - to perform a biopsy, this SB should contain at least 12 cores regardless of PSA density.""","""['Sebastian Berg', 'Karl Heinrich Tully', 'Nicolas von Landenberg', 'Henning Bahlburg', 'Florian Roghmann', 'Guido Müller', 'Julian Hanske', 'Joachim Noldus', 'Marko Brock']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Urol Int""","""['Head-to-head Comparison of Transrectal Ultrasound-guided Prostate Biopsy Versus Multiparametric Prostate Resonance Imaging with Subsequent Magnetic Resonance-guided Biopsy in Biopsy-naïve Men with Elevated Prostate-specific Antigen: A Large Prospective Multicenter Clinical Study.', 'Prostate cancer detection rate in men undergoing transperineal template-guided saturation and targeted prostate biopsy.', 'Relationship Between Prebiopsy Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Biopsy Indication, and MRI-ultrasound Fusion-targeted Prostate Biopsy Outcomes.', 'What Is the Negative Predictive Value of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Excluding Prostate Cancer at Biopsy?

To date, the mechanisms that create such oncogenic fusion genes are poorly understood. Previously we reported an unappreciated RNA-driven mechanism in human prostate cells in which the expression of chimeric RNA induces specified gene fusions in a sequence-dependent manner. One fundamental question yet to be addressed is whether such RNA-driven gene fusion mechanism is generalizable, or rather, a special case restricted to prostate cells. In this report, we demonstrated that the expression of designed chimeric RNAs in human endometrial stromal cells leads to the formation of JAZF1-SUZ12, a cancer fusion gene commonly found in low-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas. The process is specified by the sequence of chimeric RNA involved and inhibited by estrogen or progesterone. Furthermore, it is the antisense rather than sense chimeric RNAs that effectively drive JAZF1-SUZ12 gene fusion. The induced fusion gene is validated both at the RNA and the genomic DNA level. The ability of designed chimeric RNAs to drive and recapitulate the formation of JAZF1-SUZ12 gene fusion in endometrial cells represents another independent case of RNA-driven gene fusion, suggesting that RNA-driven genomic recombination is a permissible mechanism in mammalian cells. The results could have fundamental implications in the role of RNA in genome stability, and provide important insight in early disease mechanisms related to the formation of cancer fusion genes.""","""['Sachin Kumar Gupta', 'Jocelyn Duen-Ya Jea', 'Laising Yen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""PLoS Genet""","""['A neoplastic gene fusion mimics trans-splicing of RNAs in normal human cells.', 'Identification of a novel, recurrent MBTD1-CXorf67 fusion in low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma.', 'An endometrial stromal sarcoma cell line with the JAZF1/PHF1 chimera.', 'JAZF1/JJAZ1 gene fusion in endometrial stromal sarcomas: molecular analysis by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction optimized for paraffin-embedded tissue.', 'JAZF1/SUZ12 gene fusion in endometrial stromal sarcomas.', 'Recent advances in cancer fusion transcript detection.', 'Chimeric RNA Design Principles for RNA-Mediated Gene Fusion.']"""

Here, we report its effects on aspects of health-related quality of life (HRQL).  Methods:   HRQL was assessed with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer core quality-of-life questionnaire and QLM-PR25 at weeks 0, 4, 12, and then every 12 weeks until progression. Scores from week 4 to 156 were analyzed with repeated measures modeling to calculate group means and differences. Deterioration-free survival was from random assignment until the earliest of death, clinical progression, discontinuation of study treatment, or a worsening of 10 points or more from baseline in fatigue, physical function, cognitive function, or overall health and quality of life (OHQL). HRQL scores range from 0 (lowest possible) to 100 (highest possible).  Results:   HRQL was assessed in 1,042 of 1,125 participants (93%).

Patients with enlarged prostates are treated with 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) to shrink prostate volume by blocking the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). A reduction in DHT levels can elicit atrophy and apoptosis of prostate secretory luminal cells, which results in a favorable clinical response characterized by improved lower urinary tract symptoms. However, the histologic response to 5ARI treatment is often heterogeneous across prostate acini and lower urinary tract symptoms can persist to require surgical intervention. We used two spatial profiling approaches to characterize gene expression changes across histologically normal and atrophied regions in prostates from 5ARI-treated men. Objective transcriptomic profiling using the Visium spatial gene expression platform showed that 5ARI-induced atrophy of prostate luminal cells correlated with reduced androgen receptor signaling and increased expression of urethral club cell genes including LTF, PIGR, OLFM4, SCGB1A1, and SCGB3A1. Prostate luminal cells within atrophied acini adapted to decreased DHT conditions by increasing NF-κB signaling and anti-apoptotic BCL2 expression, which may explain their survival. Using GeoMx digital spatial profiling with a probe set to assess ~18 000 RNA targets, we confirmed that atrophied acini expressing SCGB3A1 displayed higher levels of club cell markers compared with histologically normal acini with NKX3-1 expression. In addition, club-like cells within regions of 5ARI-induced atrophy closely resembled true club cells from the prostatic urethra. A comparison of histologically normal regions from 5ARI-treated men and histologically normal regions from untreated men revealed few transcriptional differences. Taken together, our results describe a heterogeneous response to 5ARI treatment where cells in atrophied acini undergo an adaptation from a prostate secretory luminal to a club cell-like state in response to 5ARI treatment. © 2021 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.""","""['Diya B Joseph', 'Gervaise H Henry', 'Alicia Malewska', 'Jeffrey C Reese', 'Ryan J Mauck', 'Jeffrey C Gahan', 'Ryan C Hutchinson', 'James L Mohler', 'Claus G Roehrborn', 'Douglas W Strand']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Pathol""","""['NF-κB and androgen receptor variant 7 induce expression of SRD5A isoforms and confer 5ARI resistance.', 'Glucocorticoids are induced while dihydrotestosterone levels are suppressed in 5-alpha reductase inhibitor treated human benign prostate hyperplasia patients.', 'The prostaglandin pathway is activated in patients who fail medical therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia with lower urinary tract symptoms.', '5-Alpha-Reductase Inhibitors and Combination Therapy.', 'Dihydrotestosterone and the concept of 5alpha-reductase inhibition in human benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Differences in the pathogenetic characteristics of prostate cancer in the transitional and peripheral zones and the possible molecular biological mechanisms.', 'Advances in spatial transcriptomics and related data analysis strategies.', 'Basal epithelial cells in prostate development, tumorigenesis, and cancer progression.', 'Steroid hormone imbalance drives macrophage infiltration and Spp1/osteopontin+ foam cell differentiation in the prostate.', 'Spatially resolved whole transcriptome profiling in human and mouse tissue using Digital Spatial Profiling.']"""

Methods:   The characteristics and cause-specific death classifications of males with prostate cancer (PCa) were extracted. Multivariate competing-risk regression analysis was used to identify significant predictors and quantify the cumulative incidence of PCSM and OCM at different clinical stages.  Results:   Of the 244,433 PCa patients who were included, 19,274 died from 7356 PCSM, and 11,918 from OCM. The proportion of PCSM gradually increased from 2010 to 2016. The risk factors for PCSM in the localized PCa stage included older age, not being married, living in a county with higher poverty rates, and higher PSA levels and Gleason scores. Meanwhile, Medicaid and lower education levels were the additional risk factors of OCM. The risk factors for PCSM in the regional PCa stage included older age, not being married, Medicaid, living in a county with higher poverty rates, and higher PSA levels and Gleason scores. Meanwhile, the income level did not affect OCM risk. The risk factors for PCSM in the distant metastatic PCa stage included a separated/divorced/widowed marital status, Medicaid, and higher PSA levels and Gleason scores. Meanwhile, older age, an unmarried or separated/divorced/widowed marital status, and higher PSA levels were risk factors for OCM. In addition, receiving both surgery and radiation was worse than just receiving surgery for PCa specific survival in localized and regional PCa patients.  Conclusion:   Some pretreatment and treatment factors may influence OCM that are not identical to those for PCSM at the corresponding stage.

Patients and methods:   This study has used the PC and prostate biopsy database from the Turkish Urooncology Association. A total of 1143 patients with Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) with ≥3 lesions on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and who had received a software-guided transperineal/transrectal MRI/transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) fusion prostate biopsy with concomitant standard systematic 12-core biopsy were included in this study. csPC detection rates of the TP and TR approaches were compared following Mahalanobis distance matching within propensity score caliper method. The following four variables were selected as covariates for the matching procedure: age, digital rectal examination findings, PSA density, and the index lesion PI-RADS score.  Results:   The matched sample included 508 TR and 276 TP patients. In both the TP and the TR groups, targeted biopsy was superior to systematic biopsy in detecting csPC (27.5% vs. 24.6%, p < 0.001 and 19.5% vs. 16.3%, p < 0.0001, respectively). Both TPTB and TP systematic biopsy was found to be superior to TRTB and TR systematic biopsy in terms of csPC detection (27.5% vs. 19.5%, p = 0.012 and 24.6% vs. 16.3%, p = 0.006). In patients with an anterior index lesion, an apical index lesion, and a larger prostate, the superiority of TPTB to TRTB was found to be more prominent in terms of csPC detection (37.8% vs. 18.3%, p = 0.044; 34.6% vs. 14.7%, p = 0.002; and 25% vs. 5.1%, p = 0.033, respectively).

However, many patients recur after EBRT necessitating additional treatment, such as MR-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation (TULSA). Residual markers may compromise TULSA through ultrasound field distortions and generation of local susceptibility artifacts. The objective was to investigate how markers affect the ablation outcome during clinical TULSA treatments.  Subjects and methods:   A retrospective analysis was performed on nine patients with radiorecurrent PCa and residual markers who received TULSA. The MR susceptibility artifact was quantified as a function of marker type, size and orientation, in particular for thermometry. The spatial distribution of markers inside the prostate was recorded, and the resulting impact on the thermal dose was measured. The thermal dose measurements were directly compared to the residual enhancing prostatic tissue observed on the immediate and control post-TULSA contrast enhanced (CE) image.  Results:   Successful thermal dose accumulation to the target boundary occurred for 14/20 (70%) of markers, confirmed with CE imaging. Gold markers situated simultaneously close to the urethra (≤12 mm) and far from the target boundary (≥13 mm) reduced the ultrasound depth of heating. Nitinol markers produced large, hypointense artifacts that disrupted thermometry and compromised treatment. Artifacts from gold markers were less pronounced, but when located near the target boundary, also affected treatment.  Conclusion:   Marker composition, orientation and location inside the prostate can all potentially impact treatment outcome. Proper patient selection through detailed MRI screening is critical to ensure successful radiorecurrent PCa treatment outcomes with TULSA.""","""['Cameron Wright', 'Pietari Mäkelä', 'Mikael Anttinen', 'Teija Sainio', 'Peter J Boström', 'Roberto Blanco Sequeiros']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Hyperthermia""","""['Twelve-month prostate volume reduction after MRI-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation of the prostate.', 'Safety and efficacy of MRI-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation for radiorecurrent prostate cancer in the presence of gold fiducial markers.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation of Prostate Tissue in Patients with Localized Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Phase 1 Clinical Trial.', 'Magnetic Resonance-Guided High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (MR-HIFU): Technical Background and Overview of Current Clinical Applications (Part 1).', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-guided ultrasound ablation for prostate cancer - A contemporary review of performance.']"""

This study examined the real-world uptake of ADT treatment intensification among older men in a large Canadian province.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective population-based cohort study using province-wide linked administrative data in Ontario, Canada. Patients 66 years of age and older with de novo mCSPC were included and their treatment with conventional ADT-based regimens, ADT plus next-generation androgen receptor axis-targeted therapy, and ADT plus docetaxel were identified and stratified by time.  Results:   From 2014 to 2019, 3556 patients were identified with de novo mCSPC. Most patients (n = 2794 [78.6%]) were treated with a conventional ADT regimen, whereas 399 (11.2%) patients received ADT intensification with docetaxel and 52 (1.5%) patients received abiraterone acetate plus prednisone. In a time-stratified analysis of ADT intensification before and after the pivotal AA+P trial (LATITUDE), AA+P uptake increased from 0.5% to 3.0%, whereas docetaxel use dropped from 12.0% to 10.0%.

In this study, we identified and characterized a series of m5C-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in PCa. Univariate Cox regression analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selector operation (LASSO) regression analysis were implemented to construct a m5C-related lncRNA prognostic signature. Consequently, a prognostic m5C-lnc model was established, including 17 lncRNAs: MAFG-AS1, AC012510.1, AC012065.3, AL117332.1, AC132192.2, AP001160.2, AC129510.1, AC084018.2, UBXN10-AS1, AC138956.2, ZNF32-AS2, AC017100.1, AC004943.2, SP2-AS1, Z93930.2, AP001486.2, and LINC01135. The high m5C-lnc score calculated by the model significantly relates to poor biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival (p < 0.0001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and a decision curve analysis (DCA) further validated the accuracy of the prognostic model. Subsequently, a predictive nomogram combining the prognostic model with clinical features was created, and it exhibited promising predictive efficacy for BCR risk stratification. Next, the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network and lncRNA-protein interaction network were established to explore the potential functions of these 17 lncRNAs mechanically. In addition, functional enrichment analysis revealed that these lncRNAs are involved in many cellular metabolic pathways. Lastly, M AFG-AS1 was selected for experimental validation; it was upregulated in PCa and probably promoted PCa proliferation and invasion in vitro. These results offer some insights into the m5C's effects on PCa and reveal a predictive model with the potential clinical value to improve the prognosis of patients with PCa.""","""['Ke Wang', 'Weibo Zhong', 'Zining Long', 'Yufei Guo', 'Chuanfan Zhong', 'Taowei Yang', 'Shuo Wang', 'Houhua Lai', 'Jianming Lu', 'Pengxiang Zheng', 'Xiangming Mao']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Front Mol Biosci""","""['Identification and verification of an ALYREF-involved 5-methylcytosine based signature for stratification of prostate cancer patients and prediction of clinical outcome and response to therapies.', 'Overall Survival Signature of 5-Methylcytosine Regulators Related Long Non-Coding RNA in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'The Value of m5C-Related lncRNAs in the Prognostic Assessment and Immunotherapy of Stomach Adenocarcinoma.', 'The lncRNA epigenetics: The significance of m6A and m5C lncRNA modifications in cancer.', 'Emerging Role of RNA m5C Modification in Cardiovascular Diseases.', 'Identification and validation of a m7G-related lncRNA signature for predicting the prognosis and therapy response in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Carcinogenic roles of MAFG-AS1 in human cancers.', 'Vital roles of m5C RNA modification in cancer and immune cell biology.', 'Identification and verification of an ALYREF-involved 5-methylcytosine based signature for stratification of prostate cancer patients and prediction of clinical outcome and response to therapies.', 'Tumor necrosis factor-related lncRNAs predict prognosis and immunotherapy response for patients with lung adenocarcinoma.']"""

Methods:   A retrospective analysis for 70 patients with prostate cancer and bone disease admitted to our hospital was performed, 30 healthy persons in the same period were selected as the control group, and the advantages and disadvantages of various examinations were analyzed. All patients were diagnosed with PET whole body bone imaging. Suspicious lesions could be examined by MRI or CT. According to the results of imaging examination, patients were divided into 40 cases of malignant prostate cancer and 30 cases of benign prostate cancer. All the patients underwent 18F-FDG-PET imaging, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and TSGF + TM determination. The case diagnosis results were compared and analyzed, and the sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), and accuracy (ACC) of various detection methods were calculated. The SEN, SPE, and ACC of positron emission tomography (PET) were 90.9%, 57.8%, and 81.2%, respectively; those of TM were 79.2%, 94.6%, and 69.8%, respectively; and those of TSGF + TM were 95.9%, 100%, and 97.3%, respectively.

Results:   ITGB4 is highly expressed in many cancers, and distinct correlations exist between ITGB4 expression and the prognosis of tumor patients. We also found that the methylation and genetic alteration level of ITGB4 was associated with some cancer prognosis. Furthermore, we found a reduced phosphorylation of ITGB4 at S1457 in several tumors, such as breast and ovarian cancers. Finally, ITGB4 expression was correlated with cancer-associated fibroblasts in liver hepatocellular carcinoma and prostate adenocarcinoma, and the infiltration level of NK cells and neutrophils was observed in other cancers, such as breast invasive carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma. Moreover, RNA metabolism and protein processing-associated functions are involved in the functional mechanism of ITGB4.

Interviews were carried out by a socio-anthropologist with prostate cancer patients treated by RP within the 6 previous months. The needs and expectations identified led to the choice of a logical model of change for the construction of the PEP. Nineteen patients were included in the study; 17 of them were living with a partner. Two categories of patients appeared during the interviews: informed patients resigned to lose their sexuality and patients misinformed about the consequences of the surgery. The tailored program was built on the Health Belief Model and provides six individual sessions, including one with the partner, to meet the needs identified.

Methods:   Newly diagnosed mCSPC patients were randomized (1:1) to AA+P and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) or placebo+ADT. Patients with VM in liver or lungs with or without other soft tissue and bone metastases (based on CT/MRI) at baseline were analyzed, after 51.8 months' median follow-up. Co-primary endpoints, OS and rPFS, were analyzed.  Results:   Among 1199 patients enrolled, 228 (19%) had VM at baseline (114 each in AA+P and placebo groups), of which 53 (23.2%; AA+P = 29, Placebo = 24) had liver metastases and 117 (51.3%; AA+P = 60, Placebo = 57) had lung metastases.

While AR drives prostatic carcinogenesis, ZFHX3 is a tumour suppressor whose loss activates the PI3K/AKT signalling in advanced prostate cancer (PCa). However, it is unknown whether ZFHX3 and AR are functionally related in PCa cells and, if so, how. Here, we report that in AR-positive LNCaP and C4-2B PCa cells, androgen upregulates ZFHX3 transcription via androgen-induced AR binding to the androgen-responsive elements (AREs) of the ZFHX3 promoter. Androgen also upregulated ZFHX3 transcription in vivo, as castration dramatically reduced Zfhx3 mRNA and protein levels in mouse prostates, and ZFHX3 mRNA levels correlated with AR activities in human PCa. Interestingly, the binding of AR to one ARE occurred in the absence of androgen, and the binding repressed ZFHX3 transcription as this repressive binding was interrupted by androgen treatment. The enzalutamide antiandrogen prevented androgen from inducing ZFHX3 transcription and caused excess ZFHX3 protein degradation. In human PCa, ZFHX3 was downregulated and the downregulation correlated with worse patient survival. These findings establish a regulatory relationship between AR and ZFHX3, suggest a role of ZFHX3 in AR function and implicate ZFHX3 loss in the antiandrogen therapies of PCa.""","""['Xing Fu', 'Zhiqian Zhang', 'Mingcheng Liu', 'Juan Li', 'Jun A', 'Liya Fu', 'Chenyang Huang', 'Jin-Tang Dong']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Cell Mol Med""","""['ARF represses androgen receptor transactivation in prostate cancer.', 'A hormone-dependent feedback-loop controls androgen receptor levels by limiting MID1, a novel translation enhancer and promoter of oncogenic signaling.', 'Androgen Receptor Regulation of Local Growth Hormone in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The role of the androgen receptor in the development of prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'Addressing the Reciprocal Crosstalk between the AR and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling Pathways for Prostate Cancer Treatment.']"""

Given that treatment strategies vary depending on histological type, an accurate diagnosis is critical. This study aimed to identify the accurate diagnostic factors for SCNC of the prostate. Furthermore, the possibility of novel treatment strategies through genetic analysis was also investigated. Prostate biopsies conducted in our hospital between January 2017 and May 2020 were included. Consequently, seven cases of SCNC and four cases of adenocarcinoma with NE differentiation were identified. No significant differences in the serum neuron-specific enolase, pro-gastrin-releasing peptide, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were observed between both tumors. The Ki-67 labeling index was significantly higher, and PSA immunoreactivity tended to be lower in SCNC. Although the morphology was undetectable, genetic analysis confirmed several mutations, including those of PIK3CA and TP53. The fact that morphological findings are not apparent indicates that genetic investigation rather than only morphological findings would be important in the future. In conclusion, given the heterogeneity of serum NE markers in SCNC, diagnosis based on these markers alone is challenging. A high Ki-67 labeling index and low PSA immunoreactivity may be useful for diagnosis, but p53 immunoreactivity is insufficient in distinguishing. Although further studies are required to interpret the results of the genetic analysis involving ALK, PIK3CA, and TP53 mutations, the results of our genetic analysis suggest that PIK3CA mutations in SCNC of the prostate may provide a novel therapeutic strategy.""","""['Arika Ida', 'Yoichiro Okubo', 'Rika Kasajima', 'Kota Washimi', 'Shinya Sato', 'Emi Yoshioka', 'Kimito Osaka', 'Takahisa Suzuki', 'Yayoi Yamamoto', 'Tomoyuki Yokose', 'Takeshi Kishida', 'Yohei Miyagi']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Pathol Res Pract""","""['Telomere lengths differ significantly between small-cell neuroendocrine prostate carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the prostate.', 'PC3 is a cell line characteristic of prostatic small cell carcinoma.', 'Characterization of transcriptomic signature of primary prostate cancer analogous to prostatic small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma.', 'Androgen-deprivation therapy-induced aggressive prostate cancer with neuroendocrine differentiation.', 'Neuroendocrine differentiation in prostatic carcinomas: histogenesis, biology, clinical relevance, and future therapeutical perspectives.', 'Genomic alterations in neuroendocrine prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Recently, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 as a PSMA-targeted positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. As an alternative PSMA imaging agent, [68Ga]Ga-P16-093 ([68Ga]Ga-PSMA-093) showed excellent blood clearance and rapid tumor uptake, desirable in vivo properties for avidly detecting primary tumor and metastatic lesions in patients. To improve the availability and test the robustness of radiolabeling reaction, eluents of 68Ga/HCl from different sources of generators were evaluated.  Procedures:   Commercially available 68Ge/68Ga generators from Eckert & Ziegler, ITG and iThemba were eluted with varying molarities of hydrochloric acid (0.05-0.6 M, as recommended by each company) and reacted with P16-093 kits. Radiolabeling yields, in vitro stabilities, in vitro cell uptakes and drug release criteria of different preparations were investigated. PET/computed tomography (CT) imaging of prostate cancer patients with [68Ga]Ga-P16-093 produced by using different sources of 68Ga were performed.  Results:   Optimized P16-093 kit containing 15 μg of P16-093 (precursor) and 68 mg of sodium acetate trihydrate (buffer), a formulation previously tested in humans, was successfully labeled with eluents from Eckert & Ziegler, ITG and iThemba's generators. In vitro cell uptake studies showed that [68Ga]Ga-P16-093, formulated with ITG and iThemba's generators, exhibited equivalent PSMA-specific uptakes. Clinical studies in prostate cancer patients exhibited exceedingly comparable maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) for each lesion regardless of source of the generator used in preparation.  Conclusion:   Using different vendors' generator and lyophilized P16-093 kits, [68Ga]Ga-P16-093 could be conveniently and reliably prepared by a simple one-step reaction with excellent yields.

Prostate specific antigen (PSA), PI-RADS, ISUP grade group, clinical and pathological tumor (T) stage was compared between negative and positive nodal (N) stage. LNM were assessed with size and localization and weather they were preoperatively detected or not. In patients with preoperative CT and MRI, the results were compared intermodally.

PSA (median 9.7 vs. 14 ng/ml), PI-RADS (median 4 vs. 5), ISUP (median 2 vs. 4), and cT/pT-stage (median T2 vs. T3) was significantly higher in patients with LNM. No LNM were found in patients with ISUP-1-PCA. MRI was able to detect 67% of patients with LNM. Lymph node metastases presented on MRI predominantly small, round-shaped, located parailiacally with a minimum SAD of 4 mm (vs. CT SAD of 8 mm). In comparison, MRI was superior to CT in the detection of LNM (sensitivity 81% vs. 33%; specificity 99% vs. 97).  Conclusion:   LNM were very rare in patients with PSA < 10 ng/ml, PI-RADS ≤ 4, and ≤ cT2. MRI could detect LNM up to 4 mm with a moderate sensitivity and high specificity.

Here, we report on short-read whole-genome sequencing and genomic analyses of LNCaP, VCaP, and PC3 cells stably transduced with WT AR (PC3-AR).  Methods:   LNCaP, VCaP, and PC3-AR cell lines were sequenced to an average depth of more than 30-fold using Illumina short-read sequencing. Using various computational methods, we identified and compared the single-nucleotide variants, copy-number profiles, and the structural variants observed in the three cell lines.  Results:   LNCaP cells are composed of multiple subpopulations, which results in nonintegral copy number states and a high mutational load when the data is analyzed in bulk. All three cell lines contain pathogenic mutations and homozygous deletions in genes involved in DNA mismatch repair, along with deleterious mutations in cell-cycle, Wnt signaling, and other critical cellular processes. PC3-AR cells have a truncating mutation in TP53 and do not express the p53 protein. The VCaP cells contain a homozygous gain-of-function mutation in TP53 (p.R248W) that promotes cancer invasion, metastasis, and progression and has also been observed in prostate adenocarcinomas. In addition, we detect the signatures of chromothripsis of the q arms of chromosome 5 in both PC3-AR and VCaP cells, strengthening the association of TP53 inactivation with chromothripsis reported in other systems.

Objective:   This work aimed to produce novel heterocyclic compounds such as pyrazole, isoxazole, thiophene, chromeno[ 7,8-d]thiazole, and thiazolo[4,5-h]quinoline derivatives. The newly synthesized heterocyclic compounds were evaluated against anticancer cell lines followed by c-Met enzymatic activity and tyrosine kinases inhibition for the most active compounds.  Methods:   In this work, the 3-phenyl-2-thioxo-2,3,5,6-tetrahydrobenzo[d]thiazol-7(4H)-one (3) was synthesized through the reaction of cyclohexane-1,3-dione with phenyl isothiocyanate and elemental sulfur. Compound 3 showed interesting activity toward some chemical reagents producing new heterocyclic compounds that can not be obtained another way. The newly synthesized compounds were evaluated towards the six cancer cell lines. The most active compounds were selected and tested toward the c-Met enzyme by taking foretinib as the positive control. Also, the inhibitions toward the PC-3 cell line using the reference SGI-1776 were measured. Finally, the inhibitions towards the five tyrosine kinases were also tested.  Results:   The synthesized quinoline and chromene derivatives were evaluated toward the c-Met enzyme using foretinib as the positive control. The obtained results showed that twelve compounds exhibited IC50 values less than 1.30 nM. On the other hand, sixteen compounds showed higher inhibitions than the reference SGI-1776 (IC50 4.86 nM) toward the PC-3 cell line.  Conclusion:   Novel, heterocyclic compounds were synthesized with a high impact on biological activities. All synthesized compounds were screened for their anti-proliferative effect, and most of them revealed high potent effects. In addition, the c-Met and prostate cancer cell line PC-3 inhibitions for the most active compounds showed that these compounds exhibited high inhibitions. Anti-proliferative activity of selected compounds toward cancer cell lines classified according to the disease showed that most compounds exhibited high inhibitions.""","""['Rafat M Mohareb', 'Maher H E Helal', 'Sara S Mohamed', 'Amira E M Abdallah']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Anticancer Agents Med Chem""","""['Heterocyclization of 2-Arylidenecyclohexan-1,3-dione: Synthesis of Thiophene, Thiazole, and Isoxazole Derivatives with Potential Antitumor Activities.', 'New Approaches for the Synthesis of Fused Thiophene, Pyrazole, Pyran and Pyridine Derivatives with Anti-Proliferative Together with c-Met Kinase and Prostate Cancer Cell Inhibitions.', 'Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Novel 4,5,6,7-TetrahydrobenzoD-Thiazol-2- Yl Derivatives Derived from Dimedone with Anti-Tumor, C-Met, Tyrosine Kinase and Pim-1 Inhibitions.', 'Thiazole and Related Heterocyclic Systems as Anticancer Agents: A Review on Synthetic Strategies, Mechanisms of Action and SAR Studies.', 'Sulphur Containing Heterocyclic Compounds as Anticancer Agents.', 'Targeting c-Met in the treatment of urologic neoplasms: Current status and challenges.', 'MALAT-1/p53/miR-155/miR-146a ceRNA circuit tuned by methoxylated quercitin glycoside alters immunogenic and oncogenic profiles of breast cancer.']"""

However, the underlying mechanism for the individualized response to CIRT is still not clear. Metabolic reprogramming is essential for tumor growth and proliferation. Although changes in metabolite profiles have been detected in patients with cancer treated with photon radiotherapy, there is limited data regarding CIRT-induced metabolic changes in PCa. Therefore, the study aimed to investigate the impact of metabolic reprogramming on individualized response to CIRT in patients with PCa. Materials and Methods: Urine samples were collected from pathologically confirmed patients with PCa before and after CIRT. A UPLC-MS/MS system was used for metabolite detection. XCMS online, MetDNA, and MS-DIAL were used for peak detection and identification of metabolites. Statistical analysis and metabolic pathway analysis were performed on MetaboAnalyst. Results: A total of 1,701 metabolites were monitored in this research. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed a change in the patient's urine metabolite profiles following CIRT. Thirty-five metabolites were significantly altered, with the majority of them being amino acids. The arginine biosynthesis and histidine metabolism pathways were the most significantly altered pathways. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) showed that after CIRT, the patients could be clustered into two groups according to their metabolite profiles. The arginine biosynthesis and phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis pathways are the most significantly discriminated pathways. Conclusion: Our preliminary findings indicate that metabolic reprogramming and inhibition are important mechanisms involved in response to CIRT in patients with PCa.

HRQoL measures reflect the extent of disability and dysfunction associated with a chronic disease such as cancer. The objective of this study is to examine factors associated with HRQoL among cancer survivors. Methods: Data from the 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey was used to examine factors associated with HRQoL among participants who reported having ever been diagnosed with cancer. Four questions associated with HRQoL included self-perceived health status, number of bad physical health days, and number of bad mental health days per month. Least square regression and logistic regression models, adjusted for confounding variables, were used for an ordinal and dichotomous [5 (bad) vs. 1-4 (excellent, very good, good, fair)] scale of HRQoL, respectively. Results: Fifty nine thousand one hundred seventy three participants reported having ever been diagnosed with cancer. Adjusted mean self-perceived health status (5-point scale) among survivors of thyroid, colon, lung, cervical, breast, prostate, and ovarian cancer was 3.83 (0.05), 4.02 (0.04), 4.36 (0.06), 3.77 (0.03), 3.88 (0.03), 3.78 (0.04), and 3.96 (0.05), respectively. After adjusting for confounders, a positive dose-response effect was observed between income range and all three HRQoL measures across all seven cancer sites. Income was consistently and inversely associated with a higher chance for reporting poorer HRQoL [OR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.57-0.71], [OR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.48-0.82], [OR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.56-0.80], [OR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.56-0.86], [OR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.49-0.62], [OR:0.55, 95% CI: 0.44-0.69], [OR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.62-0.91] among those with thyroid, colon, lung, cervical, breast, prostate, and ovarian cancer, respectively.

Among patients who develop advanced PCa, 80% are affected by bone metastasis, with a sharp drop in survival rate. Despite efforts, the details of mechanisms of metastasis of PCa remain unclear. SIRT5, an NAD+-dependent deacylase, is hypothesized to be a crucial regulator of various cancers. The role of SIRT5 in cancer has not been extensively studied compared to other SIRTs. In this study, we showed significantly decreased levels of SIRT5 in PC-3M, a highly aggressive PC-3 cell variant.  Materials and methods:   We characterized the differentially expressed proteins between parental and SIRT5 KO PC-3 cells using quantitative proteomics analysis.  Results:   A significant increase in expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in SIRT5 KO cells was observed, and the PI3K/AKT/NF-ĸB signaling pathway was found significantly elevated in SIRT5 KO cells by the Gene Ontology annotation and KEGG pathway functional enrichment analysis. Moreover, we confirmed that SIRT5 can bind PI3K by immunoprecipitation analysis.

The andrographolide analog, 19-tert-butyldiphenylsilyl-8,7-epoxy andrographolide (3A.1), has shown anticancer activity against various cancers. In this study, we investigated the effect of 3A.1 alone and in combination with DTX/CBZ against mCRPC and their mechanism of action. Exposure to 3A.1 alone exhibited a dose- and time-dependent antitumor activity in mCRPC. Chou-Talalay's combination index (CI) values of all 3A.1 + TX combinations were less than 0.5, indicating synergism. Co-treatment of 3A.1 with TX reduced the required dose of DTX and CBZ (P < 0.05). Caspase assay (apoptosis) results concurred with in vitro cytotoxicity data. RNA sequencing (RNAseq), followed by ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA), identified that upregulation of heat-shock proteins (Hsp70, Hsp40, Hsp27, and Hsp90) and downregulation of MAT2A as the key player for 3A.1 response. Furthermore, the top treatment-induced differentially expressed genes (DEGs) belong to DNA damage, cell migration, hypoxia, autophagy (MMP1, MMP9, HIF-1α, Bag-3, H2AX, HMOX1, PSRC1), and cancer progression pathways. Most importantly, top downregulated DEG MAT2A has earlier been shown to be involved in cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, using in silico analysis on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, this study found that MAT2A and highly co-expressed (r > 0.7) genes, TRA2B and SF1, were associated with worse Gleason score and nodal metastasis status in prostate adenocarcinoma patients (PRAD-TCGA). Immunoblotting, comet, and migration assays corroborated these findings. These results suggest that 3A.1 may be useful in increasing the anticancer efficacy of taxanes to treat aggressive PCa. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The andrographolide analogue, 19-tert-butyldiphenylsilyl-8,7-epoxy andrographolide (3A.1), showed anticancer activity against metastatic castration-resistant and neuroendocrine variant prostate cancers (mCRPC/NEPC). Additionally, 3A.1 exhibited synergistic anticancer effect in combination with standard chemotherapy drugs docetaxel and cabazitaxel in mCRPC/NEPC. Post-treatment gene expression studies revealed that heat shock proteins (Hsp70, Hsp40, Hsp27, and Hsp90) and MAT2A are important in the mechanism of 3A.1 action and drug response. Furthermore, DNA damage, cell migration, hypoxia, and autophagy were crucial pathways for the anticancer activity of 3A.1.""","""['Taraswi Mitra Ghosh', 'Teeratas Kansom', 'Suman Mazumder', 'Joshua Davis', 'Ahmed S Alnaim', 'Shanese L Jasper', 'Chu Zhang', 'Aedan Bird', 'Praneet Opanasopit', 'Amit K Mitra', 'Robert D Arnold']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Pharmacol Exp Ther""","""['Taxane-induced Attenuation of the CXCR2/BCL-2 Axis Sensitizes Prostate Cancer to Platinum-based Treatment.', 'Suppression of heat shock protein 27 using OGX-427 induces endoplasmic reticulum stress and potentiates heat shock protein 90 inhibitors to delay castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Cabazitaxel regimens inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells and enhances the anti-tumor properties of PEDF with various efficacy and toxicity.', 'Taxane-based Combination Therapies for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: changing landscape with cabazitaxel.', 'Pre-procedural high serum visfatin and tumor necrosis factor-α might predict recurrent atrial fibrillation after catheter ablation.', 'Extended Exposure Topotecan Significantly Improves Long-Term Drug Sensitivity by Decreasing Malignant Cell Heterogeneity and by Preventing Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition.']"""

The combined SB and TB indeed detected an additional number of patients with clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa); however, it did so at the expense of a concomitant increase in biopsy cores. Our study aimed to evaluate if ipsilateral SB (ipsi-SB) + TB or contralateral SB (contra-SB) + TB could achieve almost equal csPCa detection rates as SB + TB using fewer cores based on a different csPCa definition.  Methods:   Patients with at least one positive prostate lesion were prospectively diagnosed by MRI. The combination of TB and SB was conducted in all patients. We compared the csPCa detection rates of the following four hypothetical biopsy sampling schemes with those of SB + TB: SB, TB, ipsi-SB + TB, and contra-SB + TB.  Results:   The study enrolled 279 men. The median core of SB, TB, ipsi-SB + TB, and contra-SB + TB was 10, 2, 7 and 7, respectively (P < 0.001). ipsi-SB + TB detected significantly more patients with csPCa than contra-SB + TB based on the EAU guidelines (P = 0.042). They were almost equal on the basis of the Epstein criteria (P = 1.000). Compared with SB + TB, each remaining method detected significantly fewer patients with csPCa regardless of the definition (P < 0.001) except ipsi-SB + TB on the grounds of D1 (P = 0.066). Ten additional subjects were identified with a higher Gleason score (GS) on contra-SB + TB, and only one was considered as significantly upgraded (GS = 6 on ipsi-SB + TB to a GS of 8 on contra-SB + TB).  Conclusions:   Ipsi-SB + TB could acquire an almost equivalent csPCa detection value to SB + TB using significantly fewer cores when csPCa was defined according to the EAU guidelines.

Spheroid formation of human prostate cancer (PC) LNCaP cells with ultra-low attachment surface cultureware induced the up-regulation of cancer stem cell markers, such as NANOG, and decreased the protein degradation of the Ca2+-activated K+ channel KCa1.1 by down-regulating the E3 ubiquitin ligase, FBXW7, compared with LNCaP monolayers. Accordingly, KCa1.1 activator-induced hyperpolarizing responses were larger in isolated cells from LNCaP spheroids. The pharmacological inhibition of KCa1.1 overcame the resistance of LNCaP spheroids to antiandrogens and doxorubicin (DOX). The protein expression of androgen receptors (AR) was significantly decreased by LNCaP spheroid formation and reversed by KCa1.1 inhibition. The pharmacological and genetic inhibition of MDM2, which may be related to AR protein degradation in PC stem cells, revealed that MDM2 was responsible for the acquisition of antiandrogen resistance in LNCaP spheroids, which was overcome by KCa1.1 inhibition. Furthermore, a member of the multidrug resistance-associated protein subfamily of ABC transporters, MRP5 was responsible for the acquisition of DOX resistance in LNCaP spheroids, which was also overcome by KCa1.1 inhibition. Collectively, the present results suggest the potential of KCa1.1 in LNCaP spheroids, which mimic PC stem cells, as a therapeutic target for overcoming antiandrogen- and DOX-resistance in PC cells.""","""['Susumu Ohya', 'Junko Kajikuri', 'Kyoko Endo', 'Hiroaki Kito', 'Miki Matsui']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Ca2+ -activated K+ channel KCa 1.1 as a therapeutic target to overcome chemoresistance in three-dimensional sarcoma spheroid models.', 'Transcriptional Repression and Protein Degradation of the Ca2+-Activated K+ Channel KCa1.1 by Androgen Receptor Inhibition in Human Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Difference in protein expression profile and chemotherapy drugs response of different progression stages of LNCaP sublines and other human prostate cancer cells.', 'Cancer stem cell and mesenchymal cell cooperative actions in metastasis progression and hormone resistance in prostate cancer: Potential role of androgen and gonadotropin‑releasing hormone receptors (Review).', 'Androgen receptor-related micro RNAs in prostate cancer and their role in antiandrogen drug resistance.', ""Let's Go 3D!

Most patients are killed by tumor metastasis. Recent evidence has implicated a role of the tumor microenvironment and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) in cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. Here, we examine the role of the Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) and uPA in DU 145 prostate cancer cell migration and colony formation. Knockout of NHE1 reduced cell migration. The effects of a series of novel NHE1/uPA hexamethylene-amiloride-based inhibitors with varying efficacy towards NHE1 and uPA were examined on prostate cancer cells. Inhibition of NHE1-alone, or with inhibitors combining NHE1 or uPA inhibition-generally did not prevent prostate cancer cell migration. However, uPA inhibition-but not NHE1 inhibition-prevented anchorage-dependent colony formation. Application of inhibitors at concentrations that only saturate uPA inhibition decreased tumor invasion in vivo. The results suggest that while knockout of NHE1 affects cell migration, these effects are not due to NHE1-dependent proton translocation. Additionally, while neither NHE1 nor uPA activity was critical in cell migration, only uPA activity appeared to be critical in anchorage-dependent colony formation of DU 145 prostate cancer cells and invasion in vivo.""","""['Xiuju Li', 'Benjamin Buckley', 'Konstantin Stoletov', 'Yang Jing', 'Marie Ranson', 'John D Lewis', 'Mike Kelso', 'Larry Fliegel']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Screening of 5- and 6-Substituted Amiloride Libraries Identifies Dual-uPA/NHE1 Active and Single Target-Selective Inhibitors.', 'Permissive role of Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 in migration and invasion of triple-negative basal-like breast cancer cells.', 'Na+/H+ exchanger NHE1 regulation modulates metastatic potential and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of triple-negative breast cancer cells.', 'Role of Genetic Mutations of the Na+/H+ Exchanger Isoform 1, in Human Disease and Protein Targeting and Activity.', 'Structural and Functional Changes in the Na+/H+ Exchanger Isoform 1, Induced by Erk1/2 Phosphorylation.', 'Effect of Esomeprazole Treatment on Extracellular Tumor pH in a Preclinical Model of Prostate Cancer by MRI-CEST Tumor pH Imaging.', 'The Role οf Ion Channels in the Development and Progression of Prostate Cancer.', 'Molecular Targeting of the Most Functionally Complex Gene in Precision Oncology: p53.', 'In Vivo MRI-CEST Tumor pH Imaging Detects Resistance to Proton Pump Inhibitors in Human Prostate Cancer Murine Models.']"""

In developing countries, the PCa morbidity and mortality rates are also increasing rapidly. Since androgen receptor (AR) is a key driver and plays a critical role in the regulation of PCa development, AR-targeted agents provide a key component of current therapy regimens. However, even new-generation AR antagonists are prone to drug resistance, and there is currently no effective strategy for overcoming advanced PCa aggressiveness, including drug-resistance progression. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential efficacy and novel therapy strategy of proxalutamide (a newly developed AR antagonist) in PCa. Methods: Four PCa cell lines with various biological heterogeneities were utilized in this study, namely, androgen-sensitive/-insensitive with/without AR expression. Proliferation, migration and apoptosis assays in PCa cells were used to evaluate the effective therapeutic activity of proxalutamide. The changes in lipid droplet accumulation and lipidomic profiles were analyzed to determine the influence of proxalutamide on lipogenesis in PCa cells. The molecular basis of the effects of proxalutamide on lipogenesis and the AR axis was then further investigated. Results: Proxalutamide significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of PCa cells, and its inhibitory effect was superior to that of enzalutamide (Enz, second-generation AR antagonist). Proxalutamide induced the caspase-dependent apoptosis of PCa cells. Proxalutamide significantly diminished the level of lipid droplets in PCa cells, changed the lipid profile of PCa cells and reduced the content of most lipids (especially triglycerides) in PCa cells. Proxalutamide attenuated de novo lipogenesis by inhibiting the expression of ATP citrate lyase (ACL), acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FASN) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1). Moreover, proxalutamide also decreased AR expression in PCa cells, and its inhibitory effect on lipogenesis did not depend on its ability to down-regulate AR expression. However, Enz had no effect on AR expression, lipid accumulation or lipid de novo synthesis in PCa cells. Conclusions: By co-targeting the AR axis and endogenous adipogenesis, a novel and promising strategy was established for proxalutamide to combat the progress of PCa. The unique effect of proxalutamide on the metabolic reprogramming of PCa provides a potential solution to overcome the resistance of current AR-targeted therapy, which will help to effectively prolong its clinical service life.""","""['Yue Gu', 'Mengxia Xue', 'Qizhi Wang', 'Xiaodan Hong', 'Xinyu Wang', 'Fang Zhou', 'Jianguo Sun', 'Guangji Wang', 'Ying Peng']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Metabolomic profiling to evaluate the efficacy of proxalutamide, a novel androgen receptor antagonist, in prostate cancer cells.', 'Osajin displays potential antiprostate cancer efficacy via impairment of fatty acid synthase and androgen receptor expression.', 'Emerging Therapeutic Activity of Davallia formosana on Prostate Cancer Cells through Coordinated Blockade of Lipogenesis and Androgen Receptor Expression.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Understanding the mechanisms of androgen deprivation resistance in prostate cancer at the molecular level.', 'Proxalutamide reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated inflammatory response.', 'Key events in cancer: Dysregulation of SREBPs.', 'Cheminformatic Analysis and Machine Learning Modeling to Investigate Androgen Receptor Antagonists to Combat Prostate Cancer.', 'Chaihu-Shugan-San ameliorates tumor growth in prostate cancer promoted by depression via modulating sphingolipid and glycerinphospholipid metabolism.', 'Targeting SREBP-1-Mediated Lipogenesis as Potential Strategies for Cancer.']"""

Erbium-165 is a pure AE-emitting radionuclide that is chemically matched to clinical therapeutic radionuclide 177Lu, making it a useful tool for fundamental studies on the biological effects of AEs. This work develops new biomedical cyclotron irradiation and radiochemical isolation methods to produce 165Er suitable for targeted radionuclide therapeutic studies and characterizes a new such agent targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen. Methods: Biomedical cyclotrons proton-irradiated spot-welded Ho(m) targets to produce 165Er, which was isolated via cation exchange chromatography (AG 50W-X8, 200-400 mesh, 20 mL) using alpha-hydroxyisobutyrate (70 mM, pH 4.7) followed by LN2 (20-50 µm, 1.3 mL) and bDGA (50-100 µm, 0.2 mL) extraction chromatography. The purified 165Er was radiolabeled with standard radiometal chelators and used to produce and characterize a new AE-emitting radiopharmaceutical, [165Er]PSMA-617. Results: Irradiation of 80-180 mg natHo targets with 40 µA of 11-12.5 MeV protons produced 165Er at 20-30 MBq·µA-1·h-1. The 4.9 ± 0.7 h radiochemical isolation yielded 165Er in 0.01 M HCl (400 µL) with decay-corrected (DC) yield of 64 ± 2% and a Ho/165Er separation factor of (2.8 ± 1.1) · 105. Radiolabeling experiments synthesized [165Er]PSMA-617 at DC molar activities of 37-130 GBq·µmol-1. Conclusions: A 2 h biomedical cyclotron irradiation and 5 h radiochemical separation produced GBq-scale 165Er suitable for producing radiopharmaceuticals at molar activities satisfactory for investigations of targeted radionuclide therapeutics.

We show in the current study, via heterologous protein expression, that Orai1 can enhance SK3 K+ currents, in addition to constitutively bound calmodulin (CaM). At low cytosolic Ca2+ levels that decrease SK3 K+ permeation, co-expressed Orai1 potentiates SK3 currents. This positive feedback mechanism of SK3 and Orai1 is enabled by their close co-localization. Remarkably, we discovered that loss of SK3 channel activity due to overexpressed CaM mutants could be restored by Orai1, likely via its interplay with the SK3-CaM binding site. Mapping for interaction sites within Orai1, we identified that the cytosolic strands and pore residues are critical for a functional communication with SK3. Moreover, STIM1 has a bimodal role in SK3-Orai1 regulation. Under physiological ionic conditions, STIM1 is able to impede SK3-Orai1 interplay by significantly decreasing their co-localization.

We used publicly available RNA-seq data from tumor-enriched samples of 27 BA and 65 WA PCa patients in order to identify 12 differentially expressed ERVs (padj < 0.1) and used a tissue microarray of the PCa cores from an independent set of BA and WA patients to validate the differential protein expression of one of these ERVs, ERV3-1 (p = 2.829 × 10-7). Second, we used 57 PCa tumors from patients of all ancestries from one hospital as a training set to identify the ERVs associated with time to biochemical relapse. A 29-ERV prognostic panel was then tested and validated on 35 separate PCa tumors from patients obtained in two different hospitals with a dramatic increase in prognostic power relative to clinical parameters alone (p = 7.4 × 10-11). In summary, ERV RNA expression differences in the prostate tumors of patients of different ancestries may be associated with dissimilarities in the mechanism of cancer progression.

In total, 12 features out of 22 radiomics features correlated with the Gleason groups. Our model demonstrated excellent discriminative ability (C-statistic = 0.901, 95%CI 0.859-0.943). When comparing the probability of correctly predicting significant prostate cancer between explanatory GLCM radiomic features (Sum Variance T2WI, Sum Entropy T2WI, Difference Variance T2WI, Entropy ADC and Difference Variance ADC), PSAD and PIRADS via area under the ROC curve, radiomic features were 35.0% and 34.4% more successful than PIRADS and PSAD, respectively, in correctly predicting significant prostate cancer in our patients (p < 0.001). The Sum Entropy T2WI score had the greatest impact followed by the Sum Variance T2WI.

We performed genome-wide DNA methylation profiling in leukocyte DNA from 280 African American PCa patients using Illumina MethylationEPIC array that contains about 860K CpG sties. There was a slight increase of overall methylation level (mean β value) with the increasing Gleason scores (GS = 6, GS = 7, GS ≥ 8, P for trend = 0.002). There were 78 differentially methylated CpG sites with P < 10-4 and 9 sites with P < 10-5 in the trend test. We also found 77 differentially methylated regions/genes (DMRs), including 10 homeobox genes and six zinc finger protein genes. A gene ontology (GO) molecular pathway enrichment analysis of these 77 DMRs found that the main enriched pathway was DNA-binding transcriptional factor activity. A few representative DMRs include HOXD8, SOX11, ZNF-471, and ZNF-577.

The appearance of uroplakins in the urine and/or plasma may be of potential importance in the detection of urinary tract dysfunction. The aim of the present study was to investigate uroplakin IIIa (UPIIIa) and uroplakin II (UPII) expression in patients with selected urological diseases.  Methods:   Plasma and urine from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), urethral stricture (US), urinary tract infection (UTI) and urolithiasis were compared to healthy people without urological disorders. UPs concentrations were measured by the immunoenzymatic method.  Results:   In patients with BPH and UTI, concentrations of UPIIIa in urine and plasma, as well as UPII in urine, were statistically significantly higher than in the control groups. In the US group, only the plasma UPIIIa concentration differed significantly from the control.

Therefore, it is important to develop a new drug inhibiting chemo-resistance.

Accordingly, this study examined whether HsA could induce apoptosis in aggressive prostate cancer cells, along with its underlying mechanism. Using HsA on two prostate cancer cell lines, PC-3 and LNCaP cells, the cell analysis and in vivo xenograft model were assayed. In this study, HsA induced apoptosis and autophagy in PC-3 cells. HsA-mediated ROS production attenuated HsA-induced apoptosis and autophagy after treatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger. Moreover, autophagy inhibition by 3-MA or CQ is involved in accelerating the apoptosis induced by HsA.

Targeted therapies have shown promise, but there remain fewer actionable targets in prostate cancer than in other cancers. This work aims to characterise BRD9, currently understudied in prostate cancer, and investigate its co-expression with other genes to assess its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in human prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Omics data from a total of 2053 prostate cancer patients across 11 independent datasets were accessed via Cancertool and cBioPortal. mRNA M.expression and co-expression, mutations, amplifications, and deletions were assessed with respect to key clinical parameters including survival, Gleason grade, stage, progression, and treatment. Network and pathway analysis was carried out using Genemania, and heatmaps were constructed using Morpheus.  Results: BRD9 is overexpressed in prostate cancer patients, especially those with metastatic disease. BRD9 expression did not differ in patients treated with second generation antiandrogens versus those who were not. BRD9 is co-expressed with many genes in the SWI/SNF and BET complexes, as well as those in common signalling pathways in prostate cancer.  Summary and conclusions: BRD9 has potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in prostate cancer. BRD9 also shows promise as a therapeutic target, particularly in advanced prostate cancer, and as a co-target alongside other genes in the SWI/SNF and BET complexes, and those in common prostate cancer signalling pathways.

However, the lack of a rapid and sensitive method to quantify the enzyme's activity in the current time necessitates the development of a new quantitative assay. Herein, we first tried to quantitative assay for ALKBH3 activity using an electrochemical method based on the degradation of the signal probe due to alkyl group of the m1A removal by ALKBH3. A strong electrochemical signal can be obtained when the ferrocene (Fc) labeled dsDNAs with 1-methyladenine are immobilized on the electrode. In the presence of ALKBH3, the 3' blunt of DNA can be formed because of the removal of alkyl group of the Fc-DNA probe, which can be recognized and degraded by Exonuclease III (Exo III). As a result, the electrochemical signal produced by Fc greatly decreases, and the activity of ALKBH3 can be easily detected via changes in electrochemical signal. Quantitative analysis of ALKBH3 activity showed a wide detection range (0.1 and 20 ng/mL) and low detection limit (0.04 ng/mL). Furthermore, the method can be applied to detect 1-methyladenine through ALKBH3 in cell lysates and tissue samples, providing a new method for clinical detection of prostate cancer.""","""['Wenting Cheng', 'Jiehua Ma', 'Qinfang Tao', 'Khan Adeel', 'Liangliang Xiang', 'Duxian Liu', 'Zhaoli Zhang', 'Jinlong Li']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Talanta""","""['Ultrasensitive Electrochemical Detection of Nucleic Acids Based on the Dual-Signaling Electrochemical Ratiometric Method and Exonuclease III-Assisted Target Recycling Amplification Strategy.', 'Homogeneous electrochemical aptasensor for mucin 1 detection based on exonuclease I-assisted target recycling amplification strategy.', 'Multiple self-cleaning paper-based electrochemical ratiometric biosensor based on the inner reference probe and exonuclease III-assisted signal amplification strategy.', 'Electrochemical biosensor for DNA demethylase detection based on demethylation triggered endonuclease BstUI and Exonuclease III digestion.', 'A sensitive electrochemiluminescence DNA biosensor based on the signal amplification of ExoIII enzyme-assisted hybridization chain reaction combined with nanoparticle-loaded multiple probes.']"""

However, radiotherapy utilization (RTU) rates fall short of desired benchmarks in certain Canadian provinces. We aimed to describe provincial variations in RTU across Canada.  Materials and methods:   We calculated radiotherapy utilization ratios (RTUR) for each Canadian province from 2016 (RT case counts divided by incidence counts), by cancer type (all cancers, lung, breast, rectal, prostate) and treatment intent (curative, palliative) where data were available. Data were extracted from each provincial RT data repository, cancer registry and/or RT department. We compared RTURs descriptively across provinces and to Ontario benchmarks, and calculated an estimated national RTUR. In provinces with capacity for data linkage, RTURs were compared to a linked (patient-specific) method of calculating utilization, by linking each incident case to whether RT was received within 1 year of diagnosis (RTU-1 yr).  Results:   Excluding three provinces that included re-treatments, all-cancer RTURs ranged from 0.31 in Manitoba to 0.40 in Nova Scotia. The national all-cancer RTUR was 0.35, which was comparable to Ontario benchmarks (0.34). Larger variations were seen by cancer type, with an absolute difference in RTURs of 28% for lung cancers, 27% for breast cancers, 21% for rectal cancers, and 18% for prostate cancers. RTURs for nearly all provinces were below established Ontario benchmarks for each cancer type, except prostate cancer. RTURs over-estimated RTU-1 yr by at most 5%, except for prostate cancers where they over-estimated RTU-1 yr by up to 15%.  Conclusions:   RTU varies by province in Canada, and most notably by cancer subsite. More granular data at the regional level and by healthcare facility is required to further tailor strategies aimed at improving RT access. RTURs also serve as a reasonable surrogate for linked RTU, and both methods can contribute meaningfully to measure RTU depending on the context and data availability.""","""['Jessica Chan', 'Erika Brown', 'Kristopher Dennis', 'Michael Milosevic', 'Michael Brundage']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Determining the need and utilization of radiotherapy in cancers of the breast, cervix, lung, prostate and rectum: A population level study.', 'Adherence to quality breast cancer survivorship care in four Canadian provinces: a CanIMPACT retrospective cohort study.', 'Defining the need for radiotherapy for lung cancer in the general population: a criterion-based, benchmarking approach.', 'Radiotherapy utilisation rates for patients with cancer as a function of age: A systematic review.', 'Palliative radiotherapy regimens for patients with thoracic symptoms from non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Dyspnea in patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer: a population-based analysis of disease burden and patterns of care.']"""

Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective cohort study analyzed patients aged 66 years and older who were diagnosed with prostate cancer without a second cancer in 12 months from January 2011 to December 2015. Patients with continuous Medicare Parts A, B, and D coverage were included. Individuals who received any form of HT prior to prostate cancer diagnosis and those previously diagnosed with depression were excluded. Data were collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare and Texas Cancer Registry-Medicare linked databases. Data were analyzed from February to May 2021.  Exposures:   The following treatment groups were compared: (1) no HT group, (2) traditional HT group (HT without second-generation AA exposure), and (3) second-generation AA group.  Main outcomes and measures:   Risk of depression in the second-generation AA group compared with the no HT and traditional HT groups, determined prior to data collection, stratified by diagnosis stage.

AR mRNA translation is coordinately regulated by RNA binding proteins, YTHDF3 and G3BP1. Under ambient conditions m6A-modified AR mRNA is bound by YTHDF3 and translationally stimulated, while m6A-unmodified AR mRNA is bound by G3BP1 and translationally repressed. When AR-regulated PCA cell lines are subjected to ARPI stress, m6A-modified AR mRNA is recruited from actively translating polysomes (PSs) to RNA-protein stress granules (SGs), leading to reduced AR mRNA translation. After ARPI stress, m6A-modified AR mRNA liquid-liquid phase separated with YTHDF3, while m6A-unmodified AR mRNA phase separated with G3BP1. Accordingly, these AR mRNA messages form two distinct YTHDF3-enriched or G3BP1-enriched clusters in SGs. ARPI-induced SG formation is cell-protective, which when blocked by YTHDF3 or G3BP1 silencing increases PCA cell death in response to ARPI stress. Interestingly, AR mRNA silencing also delays ARPI stress-induced SG formation, highlighting its supportive role in triggering this stress response. Our results define a new mechanism for stress adaptive cell survival after ARPI stress involving SG-regulated translation of AR mRNA, mediated by m6A RNA modification and their respective regulatory proteins.""","""['Syam Prakash Somasekharan', 'Neetu Saxena', 'Fan Zhang', 'Eliana Beraldi', 'Jia Ni Huang', 'Christina Gentle', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Marisa Thi', 'Poul H Sorensen', 'Martin Gleave']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Nucleic Acids Res""","""['Chaperone-mediated autophagy promotes PCa survival during ARPI through selective proteome remodeling.', 'G3BP1-linked mRNA partitioning supports selective protein synthesis in response to oxidative stress.', 'Androgen receptor (AR) antagonism triggers acute succinate-mediated adaptive responses to reactivate AR signaling.', 'SILAC-based quantitative MS approach reveals Withaferin A regulated proteins in prostate cancer.', 'RNA-binding protein DDX3 mediates posttranscriptional regulation of androgen receptor: A mechanism of castration resistance.', 'Epigenetic Modifications in Prostate Cancer Metastasis and Microenvironment.', 'Aberrant RNA m6A modification in gastrointestinal malignancies: versatile regulators of cancer hallmarks and novel therapeutic opportunities.', 'Research progress of m6A methylation in prostate cancer.', 'Technologies Enabling Single-Molecule Super-Resolution Imaging of mRNA.', 'ELAVL1 promotes prostate cancer progression by interacting with other m6A regulators.']"""

Methods:   In a case-control study nested in the Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden (PCBaSe) RAPID 2019, we evaluated the association between ADT and COVID-19 as registered cause of death in men with prostate cancer. Each case was matched to 50 controls by region. We used conditional logistic regression to adjust for confounders and also evaluated potential impact of residual confounding.  Results:   We identified 474 men who died from COVID-19 in March-December 2020. In crude analyses, ADT exposure was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 death (odds ratio [OR] 5.05, 95% CI: 4.18-6.10); however, the OR was substantially attenuated after adjustment for age, comorbidity, prostate cancer characteristics at diagnosis, recent healthcare use, and indicators of advanced cancer (adjusted OR 1.25, 95% CI: 0.95-1.65). If adjustment has accounted for at least 85% of confounding, then the true effect could be no more than a 5% reduction of the odds for COVID-19 death.

Approximately, 60% of patients receiving enzalutamide show initial remission followed by disease relapse with the emergence of highly aggressive castration-resistant prostate cancer. Solute carrier (SLC) proteins play a critical role in the development of drug resistance by altering cellular metabolism. Transcriptome analysis revealed the predominance of SLC25A17 and SLC27A6 in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells; however, their role in antiandrogen resistance has not been elucidated. sgRNA-mediated knockdown of SLC25A17 and SLC27A6 suppressed cell proliferation and migration in enzalutamide-resistant cells. An induction of G1/S cell cycle arrest and abundance of hypo-diploid cells along with the reduction in the protein expression CyclinD1 and CDK6, the checkpoint factors, was observed including increased cell death as evident by BAX upregulation in knockdown cells. Inhibition of SLC25A17 and SLC27A6 resulted in downregulation of fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase with parallel decrease in the levels of lactic acid in enzalutamide resistant cells. However, downregulation of triglyceride and citric acid was only observed in SLC25A17 silenced cells. The protein-protein interaction of SLC25A17 and SLC27A6 revealed alteration in some common drug-resistant and metabolism-related genes. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas database exhibiting high SLC25A17 and SLC27A6 gene expression in prostate cancer patients were associated with poor survival than those with low expression of these proteins. In conclusion, SLC25A17 and SLC27A6 and its interactive network play an essential role in the development of enzalutamide resistance through metabolic reprogramming and may be identified as therapeutic target(s) to circumvent drug resistance.""","""['Prem P Kushwaha', 'Shiv S Verma', 'Eswar Shankar', 'Spencer Lin', 'Sanjay Gupta']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mol Carcinog""","""['Metabolic Reprogramming and Predominance of Solute Carrier Genes during Acquired Enzalutamide Resistance in Prostate Cancer.', 'Bioengineered BERA-Wnt5a siRNA Targeting Wnt5a/FZD2 Signaling Suppresses Advanced Prostate Cancer Tumor Growth and Enhances Enzalutamide Treatment.', 'Targeting CPT1B as a potential therapeutic strategy in castration-resistant and enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Mechanisms of enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer and therapeutic strategies to overcome it.', 'Understanding the mechanisms of androgen deprivation resistance in prostate cancer at the molecular level.', 'Multiomics data analyses to identify SLC25A17 as a novel biomarker to predict the prognosis and immune microenvironment in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Comprehensive analysis of fatty acid metabolism-related gene signatures for predicting prognosis in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Chaperone-mediated autophagy promotes PCa survival during ARPI through selective proteome remodeling.']"""

To gain mechanistic insights into METRO-TOPO activity, in this study we determined the effect of METRO- and CONV-TOPO treatment in a panel of human PCa cell lines representing castration-sensitive/resistant, androgen receptor (+/-), and those of different ethnicity on cell growth and gene expression. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified for METRO-TOPO therapy and compared to a PCa patient cohort and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The top five DEGs were SERPINB5, CDKN1A, TNF, FOS, and ANGPT1. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis predicted several upstream regulators and identified top molecular networks associated with METRO dosing, including tumor suppression, anti-proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis, and inflammation. Further, the top DEGs were associated with increase survival of PCa patients (TCGA database), as well as ethnic differences in gene expression patterns in patients and cell lines representing African Americans (AA) and European Americans (EA).

Androgen receptor (AR)+ forkhead box A1 (FOXA1)+ prostate cancer cells are exquisitely sensitive to dual SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 degradation relative to normal and other cancer cell lines. SWI/SNF ATPase degradation rapidly compacts cis-regulatory elements bound by transcription factors that drive prostate cancer cell proliferation, namely AR, FOXA1, ERG and MYC, which dislodges them from chromatin, disables their core enhancer circuitry, and abolishes the downstream oncogenic gene programs. SWI/SNF ATPase degradation also disrupts super-enhancer and promoter looping interactions that wire supra-physiologic expression of the AR, FOXA1 and MYC oncogenes themselves. AU-15330 induces potent inhibition of tumour growth in xenograft models of prostate cancer and synergizes with the AR antagonist enzalutamide, even inducing disease remission in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) models without toxicity.

Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes) is a bacterium in the normal skin microbiota, which has the ability to survive intracellularly in macrophages and is significantly more common in prostate cancer tissue compared with normal prostate tissue. This study investigated if prostate cancer tissue culture positive for C. acnes has a higher infiltration of regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and if macrophages stimulated with C. acnes induced the expression of immunosuppressive genes that could be linked to an increase of Tregs in prostate cancer. Real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay (ELISA) were used to examine the expression of immunosuppressive genes in human macrophages stimulated in vitro with C. acnes, and associations between the presence of C. acnes and infiltration of Tregs were investigated by statistically analyzing data generated in two previous studies. The in vitro results demonstrated that macrophages stimulated with C. acnes significantly increased their expression of PD-L1, CCL17, and CCL18 mRNA and protein (p <0.05). In the cohort, Tregs in tumor stroma and tumor epithelia were positively associated with the presence of C. acnes (P = 0.0004 and P = 0.046, respectively). Since the macrophages stimulated with C. acnes in vitro increased the expression of immunosuppressive genes, and prostate cancer patients with prostatic C. acnes infection had higher infiltration of Tregs than their noninfected counterparts, we suggest that C. acnes may contribute to an immunosuppressive tumor environment that is vital for prostate cancer progression. IMPORTANCE In an immune suppressive tumor microenvironment constituted by immunosuppressive cells and immunosuppressive mediators, tumors may improve their ability to give rise to a clinically relevant cancer. In the present study, we found that C. acnes might contribute to an immunosuppressive environment by recruiting Tregs and by increasing the expression of immunosuppressive mediators such as PD-L1, CCL17, and CCL18. We believe that our data add support to the hypothesis of a contributing role of C. acnes in prostate cancer development. If established that C. acnes stimulates prostate cancer progression it may open up avenues for targeted prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Sabina Davidsson', 'Jessica Carlsson', 'Larry Greenberg', 'Jonny Wijkander', 'Bo Söderquist', 'Ann Erlandsson']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Microbiol Spectr""","""['Immune cell analyses of the tumor microenvironment in prostate cancer highlight infiltrating regulatory T cells and macrophages as adverse prognostic factors.', 'Surgical trauma-induced CCL18 promotes recruitment of regulatory T cells and colon cancer progression.', 'Immune suppression in premalignant respiratory papillomas: enriched functional CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells and PD-1/PD-L1/L2 expression.', 'Regulatory T Cells: Barriers of Immune Infiltration Into the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Metabolic Regulation of Tregs in Cancer: Opportunities for Immunotherapy.', 'Uncovering the special microbiota associated with occurrence and progression of gastric cancer by using RNA-sequencing.', 'Microbiota of Urine, Glans and Prostate Biopsies in Patients with Prostate Cancer Reveals a Dysbiosis in the Genitourinary System.']"""

Results:   Medication use included PDEi in 14.2% and AA in 23.0%. PDEi use was associated with 19.3% smaller lesion diameter (-2.8 mm; CI from -4.8 to -0.7; p < 0.01) and lower PIRADS scores on MRI (OR 0.60; CI 0.40 - 1.00; p = 0.05).

Downregulation of miR-485-3p has been revealed to participate in the tumorigenesis and progression of many types of cancer. However, the clinical and biological role of miR-485-3p in PC remains largely unknown.  Methods:   The expression of miR-485-3p was analyzed in the published databases and detected in our clinical samples and cell lines by RT-qPCR assay. CCK8, transwell invasion and migration, and colony formation assays were performed to investigate the biological function of miR-485-3p. Bioinformatical analysis, RIP, western blotting and luciferase reporter assays were carried out to explore the downstream mechanism of miR-485-3p.  Results:   The level of miR-485-3p was downregulated in PC tissues, particularly in primary PC tissues with metastasis relative to normal prostate tissues. miR-485-3p downregulation was positively correlated with poor disease-free and overall survival in patients with PC. Functionally, miR-485-3p overexpression dramatically suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion ability of PC cells in vitro. Mechanistically, miR-485-3p overexpression suppressed the activity of TGF-β signaling by targeting TGFBR2 to play tumor-suppressive roles in PC progression.

Methods:   Study cohort included 963 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed PCa referred for Ga-68 PSMA-11 PET/CT study for staging. The incidence of bone involvement, type of bone metastases, and extent of disease were determined and correlated with the ISUP Grade Group (GG) criteria and PSA levels.  Results:   Bone metastases were found in 188 (19.5%) of 963 patients. Bone metastases were found in 10.7% of patients with PSA < 10 ng/dL and in 27.4% of patients with PSA > 10 ng/dL and in 6.1% of patients with GG ≤ 2/3 and in 8.9% of patients with GG 4/5. In 7.6% of the patients, skeletal involvement was extensive, while 11.9% of patients had oligometastatic disease.

Consequently, there is an urgent need for inhibitors to suppress the deubiquitination activity of USP2a so as to upregulate FAS protein degradation. We first analyzed the relationship between the expression level of USP2a and survival using The Cancer Genome Atlas Head-Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSC) data collection. Our results suggested survival rates were lower among HNSC patients expressing higher levels of USP2a. We then investigated two thiopurine drugs, 6-thioguanine (6-TG) and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), to determine whether they could potentially serve as inhibitors of USP2a. Western blot analysis showed that levels of two USP2a target proteins, FAS and Mdm2, were dose-dependently decreased in A253 submaxillary carcinoma cells treated with 6-TG or 6-MP. Responding to the degradation of Mdm2, levels of p53 were increased. We found that 6-TG and 6-MP also suppressed levels of both USP2a mRNA and protein, suggesting these two thiopurines do not act solely through direct inhibition of USP2a. The effects of 6-TG and 6-MP were not cell type-specific, as they elicited similar decreases in FAS protein in leukemia, prostate and cervical cancer cell lines. 6-TG and 6-MP had effects on several cell cycle proteins, including another USP2a target protein, cyclin D1. The populations of cells in subG1 and S phase were increased by 6-TG and 6-MP, which was accompanied by reductions in G1 phase cells. In untreated cells, USP2a transfection increased FAS and cyclin D1 levels compared to an enzyme-dead USP2a C276A mutant, which lacked deubiquitinating activity. However, USP2a transfection failed to reverse the suppressive effects of 6-TG and 6-MP on FAS levels. In summary, these findings suggest 6-TG and 6-MP reduce the stability of some USP2a targets, including FAS and Mdm2, by inhibiting USP2a-catalyzed deubiquitination in some cancer cells. Our work also provides repurposing evidence supporting 6-TG and 6-MP as target therapeutic drugs, such as USP2a/FAS in this study.""","""['Chiao-Pei Cheng', 'Shu-Ting Liu', 'Yi-Lin Chiu', 'Shih-Ming Huang', 'Ching-Liang Ho']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""['MYC is activated by USP2a-mediated modulation of microRNAs in prostate cancer.', 'MdmX is a substrate for the deubiquitinating enzyme USP2a.', 'The isopeptidase USP2a regulates the stability of fatty acid synthase in prostate cancer.', 'Progress of Research on 6-Thioguanine versus 6-Mercaptopurine in childhood ALL.', 'Thiopurine methyltransferase: should it be measured before commencing thiopurine drug therapy?', 'Ubiquitin-proteasome system as a target for anticancer treatment-an update.']"""

Propensity score matching (PSM), multivariable Cox proportional hazard model, Kaplan-Meier method and subgroup analysis were performed in our study.  Results:   NEPC patients were inclined to be older at diagnosis (Median age, 69(61-77) vs. 65(59-72), P< 0.001) and had higher rates of muscle invasive disease (30.9% vs. 9.2%, P < 0.001), lymph node metastasis (32.2% vs. 2.2%, P < 0.001), and distal metastasis (45.7% vs. 3.6%, P < 0.001) compared with prostate adenocarcinoma patients.

Prostate cancer bone metastases are commonly blastic, exhibiting new growth of unhealthy sclerotic bone, which can cause painful skeletal related events. Patient's current care entails androgen deprivation therapy, anti-resorptive agents, radiation, and chemotherapy to help control the spread of the cancer but little intervention is available to treat blastic bone disease. The transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathways are known to regulate bone growth and resorption of destructive lytic bone lesions, yet the role of TGFβ/BMP signaling in prostate cancer blastic vs lytic bone lesions are not fully understood. We hypothesized that to target the BMP/TGFβ pathway, a useful biomarker of bone lytic or blastic pathology would have superior response. We show distinct BMP vs. TGFβ signaling in clinical samples of human prostate cancer bone metastases with either lytic or blastic pathologies. BMPs exhibit distinct effects on bone homeostasis, so to examine the effect of BMP inhibition on healthy bone, we treated mice with the BMP receptor small molecule antagonist DMH1 and saw a modest temporary improvement in bone health, with increased trabecular bone. We next sought to use the BMP inhibitor DMH1 to treat bone metastasis engraftment seeded by a caudal artery injection of the lytic human prostate cell line PC3 in immunodeficient mice. The colonization by PC3 cells to the bone were restricted with DMH1 treatment and bone health was importantly preserved. We next proceeded to test BMP inhibition in an injury model of established bone metastasis via intratibial injection of the MYC-CaP mouse prostate cell line into FVBN syngeneic mice. DMH1 treated mice had a modest decrease in trabecular bone and reduced lymphocytes in circulation without affecting tumor growth. Taken together we show unique responses to BMP inhibition in metastatic prostate cancer in the bone. These studies suggest that profiling bone lesions in metastatic prostate cancer can help identify therapeutic targets that not only treat the metastatic tumor but also address the need to better treat the distinct tumor induced bone disease.""","""['Desiree M Straign', 'Claire L Ihle', 'Meredith D Provera', 'Philip Owens']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)""","""['Combined inhibition of the BMP pathway and the RANK-RANKL axis in a mixed lytic/blastic prostate cancer lesion.', 'Influence of BMPs on the formation of osteoblastic lesions in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Bone morphogenetic protein pathway responses and alterations of osteogenesis in metastatic prostate cancers.', 'Bone morphogenetic proteins and their receptor signaling in prostate cancer.', 'Bone morphogenetic proteins.', 'Biological and Clinical Aspects of Metastatic Spinal Tumors.', 'Muscle and Bone Defects in Metastatic Disease.', 'Isoquercitrin Attenuates Osteogenic Injury in MC3T3 Osteoblastic Cells and the Zebrafish Model via the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE Pathway.']"""

In particular, percent Gleason pattern 4 (GP4) has been shown to predict outcome in several studies, although conflicting results have also been reported. A major issue with these studies is that they rely on surrogate markers of outcome rather than patient survival. We have investigated the prognostic predictive value of quantifying GP4 in a series of prostatic biopsies containing Gleason score 3+4=7 and 4+3=7 tumours. It was found that the length of GP4 tumour determined from the measurement of all biopsy cores from a single patient, percent GP4 present and absolute GP4 were all significantly associated with distant progression of tumour, all-cause mortality and cancer-specific mortality over a 10-year follow-up period.

There is no consensus on the treatment of choice for these patients, and either radical prostatectomy (RP) or external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is recommended. Surgery is less common as the initial treatment for high-risk patients, possibly reflecting the concerns regarding morbidity as well as oncological and functional outcomes. Another high-risk group includes patients with failure of previous EBRT or focal treatment. For these patients, salvage radical prostatectomy (SRP) can be offered.  Objectives:   To describe our experience with surgery of high-risk patients and SRP.  Methods:   This cohort included all high-risk patients undergoing RP or SRP at our institution between January 2012 and December 2019. We reviewed the electronic medical charts and collected pathological, functional, and oncological outcomes.  Results:   Our cohort included 39 patients; average age was 67.8 years, and average follow-up duration was 40.9 months. The most common postoperative morbidity was transfusion of packed cells. There were no life-threatening events or postoperative mortality. Continence was preserved (zero to one pad) in 76% of the patients. Twenty-three patients (59%) had undetectable prostate specific antigen levels following the surgery, 11 (30%) were treated with either adjuvant or salvage EBRT, and 12 patients (31%) were found with no evidence of disease and no additional treatment was needed.

Using genetically engineered mouse models, we found that in a mouse model of high grade prostatic intraneoplasia (HGPIN), a combination of fatty acid synthase (FASN) overexpression and cholesterol efflux pump (Abca1) knockout resulted in the progression of prostatic intraneoplasia (PIN) to invasive PCa with 100% penetrance, as well as an increase in prostate cancer stem cell (PCSC)population, accompanied by activation of PGE2 and TGF-β signaling pathway.

Despite the initial promise in phase I trial, further testing of L-377,202 (herein called Dox-PSA) was ceased due to some degree of non-specific activation and toxicity concerns. To improve safety of Dox-PSA, we encapsulated it into low temperature-sensitive liposomes (LTSL) to bypass systemic activation, while maintaining its biological activity upon controlled release in response to mild hyperthermia (HT). A time-dependent accumulation of activated prodrug in the nuclei of PSA-expressing cells exposed to mild HT was observed, showing that Dox-PSA was efficiently released from the LTSL, cleaved by PSA and entering the cell nucleus as free Dox. Furthermore, we have shown that Dox-PSA loading in LTSL can block its biological activity at 37°C, while the combination with mild HT resulted in augmented cytotoxicity in both 2D and 3D PC models compared to the free Dox-PSA. More importantly, Dox-PSA encapsulation in LTSL prolonged its blood circulation and reduced Dox accumulation in the heart of C4-2B tumor-bearing mice over the free Dox-PSA, thus significantly improving Dox-PSA therapeutic window. Finally, Dox-PSA-loaded LTSL combined with HT significantly delayed tumor growth at a similar rate as mice treated with free Dox-PSA in both solid and metastatic PC tumor models. This indicates this strategy could block the systemic cleavage of Dox-PSA without reducing its efficacy in vivo, which could represent a safer option to treat patients with locally advanced PC. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This study investigates a new tactic to tackle non-specific cleavage of doxorubicin PSA-activatable prodrug (L-377,202) to treat advanced prostate cancer. In the present study, we report a nanoparticle-based approach to overcome the non-specific activation of L-377,202 in the systemic circulation. This includes encapsulating Dox-PSA in low temperature-sensitive liposomes to prevent its premature hydrolysis and non-specific cleavage. This class of liposomes offers payload protection against degradation in plasma, improved pharmacokinetics and tumor targeting, and an efficient and controlled drug release triggered by mild hyperthermia (HT) (∼42°C). We believe that this strategy holds great promise in bypassing any systemic toxicity concerns that could arise from the premature activation of the prodrug whilst simultaneously being able to control the spatiotemporal context of Dox-PSA cleavage and metabolism.""","""['Sara Pereira', 'Guanglong Ma', 'Li Na', 'Samo Hudoklin', 'Mateja E Kreft', 'Nina Kostevsek', 'Wafa T Al-Jamal']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Acta Biomater""","""['Intracellular Activation of a Prostate Specific Antigen-Cleavable Doxorubicin Prodrug: A Key Feature Toward Prodrug-Nanomedicine Design.', 'Dually targeted bioinspired nanovesicle delays advanced prostate cancer tumour growth in vivo.', 'Efficacy of liposomes and hyperthermia in a human tumor xenograft model: importance of triggered drug release.', 'Targeted prodrug approaches for hormone refractory prostate cancer.', 'Temperature-sensitive polymers to promote heat-triggered drug release from liposomes: Towards bypassing EPR.']"""

Few studies combined results for the two types metastatic location (peripheral and spinal). Therefore we performed a multicenter retrospective study of surgically managed peripheral and spinal bone metastases to assess: (1) global function at a minimum 1 year's follow-up and; (2) factors affecting survival.  Hypothesis:   Global function is improved by surgery, with acceptable survival.  Material and method:   Between 2015 and 2016, 386 patients were operated on in 11 centers for 401 metastases: 231 peripheral, and 170 spinal. Mean age was 62.6±12.5 years in the 212 female patients (54%) versus 66.4±11.5 years in the 174 males (46%) (p=0.001). Pre- to postoperative comparison was made on pain on VAS (visual analog scale), WHO (World Health Organization) score, Karnofsky score, walking and global upper-limb function. Survival was estimated at 4 years' follow-up.  Results:   The most frequent locations were in the femur (n=146, 36%) and thoracic spine (n=107, 27%). The primary cancer was revealed by the metastasis in 82 patients (21%). There were 55 general complications (14%) and 48 local complications (12%). Twenty-one patients (5.4%) died during the first month. VAS and Karnofsky sores improved: respectively, 6.6±2.3 vs. 3.4±2.1 (p<0.001) and 65±14 vs. 72±20 (p=0.01). Walking, upper-limb function and Frankel grade improved in respectively 49/86 (57%), 19/29 (66%) and 31/84 (37%) patients. Median survival was 13.3 months (95% CI: 10.8-17.1), and was related to the primary (log-rank, p<0.001): lung 6.5 months (95% CI: 5.2-8.9), prostate 11.1 months (95% CI: 5.3-43.6), kidney 12.9 months (95% CI: 8.4-22.6), breast 26.5 months (95% CI: 19.0-34.0), and thyroid 49.0 months (95% CI: 12.2-NA). On multivariate analysis, independent factors for death comprised internal fixation rather than prosthesis (OR=2.20; 95% CI: 1.59-3.04 (p<0.001)), high preoperative ASA score (OR=1.78; 95% CI: 1.40-2.28 (p<0.001)), preoperative chemotherapy (OR=1.26; 95% CI: 1.13-1.41 (p<0.001)) and major visceral metastasis (lung, brain, liver) (OR=11.80; 95% CI: 5.21-26.71 (p<0.001)).  Conclusion:   Although function improved only slightly, pain relief and maintained autonomy suggest enhanced comfort in life, confirming the study hypothesis only partially.

Interest in the use of exosomes as targeted drug delivery vehicles has grown since it was shown that they can bind specific cells and deliver intact genetic material to the cytosol of target cells. We isolated extracellular vesicles (EVs), consisting of a mixture of exosomes and microvesicles, from prostate (PC3) and melanoma (M21) cancer cell lines using serial ultracentrifugation. Interrogation via western blot analysis confirmed enrichment of CD63, a widely recognized EV surface protein, in the EV pellet from both cell lines. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) of EV pellets revealed that the two cell lines produced distinct vesicle size profiles in the ≈30 nm to ≈400 nm range. NTA further showed that the fraction of exosomes to all EVs was constant, suggesting cellular mechanisms that control the fraction of secreted vesicles that are exosomes. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the unmodified PC3 EVs showed vesicles with cup-like (i.e., nanocapsule) and previously unreported prolate morphologies. The observed non-spherical morphologies for dehydrated exosomal vesicles (size ≈30-100 nm) are most likely related to the dense packing of proteins in exosome membranes.

Dose-response curves were created for local failure (LF) and regional + distant metastatic failure (rdMF) using logistic regression.  Results and limitations:   A total of 571 patients were included in the FLAME trial.

Radiation-associated MIBC (RA-MIBC) can be difficult to manage given the challenges of delivering definitive therapy to a previously irradiated pelvis. The genomic landscape of RA-MIBC and whether it is distinct from non-RA-MIBC are unknown.  Objective:   To define mutational features of RA-MIBC and compare the genomic landscape of RA-MIBC with that of non-RA-MIBC.  Design, setting, and participants:   We identified patients from our institution who received radiotherapy for prostate cancer and subsequently developed MIBC.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We performed whole exome sequencing of bladder tumors from RA-MIBC patients. Tumor genetic alterations including mutations, copy number alterations, and mutational signatures were identified and were compared with genetic features of non-RA-MIBC. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate recurrence-free (RFS) and overall (OS) survival.  Results and limitations:   We identified 19 RA-MIBC patients with available tumor tissue (n = 22 tumors) and clinical data. The median age was 76 yr, and the median time from prostate cancer radiation to RA-MIBC was 12 yr. The median RFS was 14.5 mo and the median OS was 22.0 mo. Compared with a cohort of non-RA-MIBC analyzed in parallel, there was no difference in tumor mutational burden, but RA-MIBCs had a significantly increased number of short insertions and deletions (indels) consistent with previous radiation exposure. We identified mutation signatures characteristic of APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis, aging, and homologous recombination deficiency. The frequency of mutations in many known bladder cancer genes, including TP53, KDM6A, and RB1, as well as copy number alterations such as CDKN2A loss was similar in RA-MIBC and non-RA-MIBC.  Conclusions:   We identified unique mutational properties that likely contribute to the distinct biological and clinical features of RA-MIBC.  Patient summary:   Bladder cancer is a rare but serious diagnosis following radiation for prostate cancer. We characterized genetic features of bladder tumors arising after prostate radiotherapy, and identify similarities with and differences from bladder tumors from patients without previous radiation.""","""['Matthew Mossanen', 'Filipe L F Carvalho', 'Vinayak Muralidhar', 'Mark A Preston', 'Brendan Reardon', 'Jake R Conway', 'Catherine Curran', 'Dory Freeman', 'Sybil Sha', 'Guru Sonpavde', 'Michelle Hirsch', 'Adam S Kibel', 'Eliezer M Van Allen', 'Kent W Mouw']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer Arising After Prostate Radiotherapy: A Rare Entity with Unique Genomic Features.', 'Re: Matthew Mossanena, Filipe L.F.

We analysed new data from two randomised controlled phase 3 trials done in a multiarm, multistage platform protocol to assess the efficacy of adding abiraterone and prednisolone alone or with enzalutamide to ADT in this patient population.  Methods:   These open-label, phase 3 trials were done at 113 sites in the UK and Switzerland. Eligible patients (no age restrictions) had high-risk (defined as node positive or, if node negative, having at least two of the following: tumour stage T3 or T4, Gleason sum score of 8-10, and prostate-specific antigen [PSA] concentration ≥40 ng/mL) or relapsing with high-risk features (≤12 months of total ADT with an interval of ≥12 months without treatment and PSA concentration ≥4 ng/mL with a doubling time of <6 months, or a PSA concentration ≥20 ng/mL, or nodal relapse) non-metastatic prostate cancer, and a WHO performance status of 0-2. Local radiotherapy (as per local guidelines, 74 Gy in 37 fractions to the prostate and seminal vesicles or the equivalent using hypofractionated schedules) was mandated for node negative and encouraged for node positive disease. In both trials, patients were randomly assigned (1:1), by use of a computerised algorithm, to ADT alone (control group), which could include surgery and luteinising-hormone-releasing hormone agonists and antagonists, or with oral abiraterone acetate (1000 mg daily) and oral prednisolone (5 mg daily; combination-therapy group). In the second trial with no overlapping controls, the combination-therapy group also received enzalutamide (160 mg daily orally). ADT was given for 3 years and combination therapy for 2 years, except if local radiotherapy was omitted when treatment could be delivered until progression. In this primary analysis, we used meta-analysis methods to pool events from both trials. The primary endpoint of this meta-analysis was metastasis-free survival. Secondary endpoints were overall survival, prostate cancer-specific survival, biochemical failure-free survival, progression-free survival, and toxicity and adverse events. For 90% power and a one-sided type 1 error rate set to 1·25% to detect a target hazard ratio for improvement in metastasis-free survival of 0·75, approximately 315 metastasis-free survival events in the control groups was required. Efficacy was assessed in the intention-to-treat population and safety according to the treatment started within randomised allocation. STAMPEDE is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00268476, and with the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN78818544.  Findings:   Between Nov 15, 2011, and March 31, 2016, 1974 patients were randomly assigned to treatment. The first trial allocated 455 to the control group and 459 to combination therapy, and the second trial, which included enzalutamide, allocated 533 to the control group and 527 to combination therapy. Median age across all groups was 68 years (IQR 63-73) and median PSA 34 ng/ml (14·7-47); 774 (39%) of 1974 patients were node positive, and 1684 (85%) were planned to receive radiotherapy. With median follow-up of 72 months (60-84), there were 180 metastasis-free survival events in the combination-therapy groups and 306 in the control groups. Metastasis-free survival was significantly longer in the combination-therapy groups (median not reached, IQR not evaluable [NE]-NE) than in the control groups (not reached, 97-NE; hazard ratio [HR] 0·53, 95% CI 0·44-0·64, p<0·0001). 6-year metastasis-free survival was 82% (95% CI 79-85) in the combination-therapy group and 69% (66-72) in the control group. There was no evidence of a difference in metatasis-free survival when enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate were administered concurrently compared with abiraterone acetate alone (interaction HR 1·02, 0·70-1·50, p=0·91) and no evidence of between-trial heterogeneity (I2 p=0·90). Overall survival (median not reached [IQR NE-NE] in the combination-therapy groups vs not reached [103-NE] in the control groups; HR 0·60, 95% CI 0·48-0·73, p<0·0001), prostate cancer-specific survival (not reached [NE-NE] vs not reached [NE-NE]; 0·49, 0·37-0·65, p<0·0001), biochemical failure-free-survival (not reached [NE-NE] vs 86 months [83-NE]; 0·39, 0·33-0·47, p<0·0001), and progression-free-survival (not reached [NE-NE] vs not reached [103-NE]; 0·44, 0·36-0·54, p<0·0001) were also significantly longer in the combination-therapy groups than in the control groups. Adverse events grade 3 or higher during the first 24 months were, respectively, reported in 169 (37%) of 451 patients and 130 (29%) of 455 patients in the combination-therapy and control groups of the abiraterone trial, respectively, and 298 (58%) of 513 patients and 172 (32%) of 533 patients of the combination-therapy and control groups of the abiraterone and enzalutamide trial, respectively. The two most common events more frequent in the combination-therapy groups were hypertension (abiraterone trial: 23 (5%) in the combination-therapy group and six (1%) in control group; abiraterone and enzalutamide trial: 73 (14%) and eight (2%), respectively) and alanine transaminitis (abiraterone trial: 25 (6%) in the combination-therapy group and one (<1%) in control group; abiraterone and enzalutamide trial: 69 (13%) and four (1%), respectively). Seven grade 5 adverse events were reported: none in the control groups, three in the abiraterone acetate and prednisolone group (one event each of rectal adenocarcinoma, pulmonary haemorrhage, and a respiratory disorder), and four in the abiraterone acetate and prednisolone with enzalutamide group (two events each of septic shock and sudden death).  Interpretation:   Among men with high-risk non-metastatic prostate cancer, combination therapy is associated with significantly higher rates of metastasis-free survival compared with ADT alone. Abiraterone acetate with prednisolone should be considered a new standard treatment for this population.

EVs were isolated from plasma of 38 patients with prostate cancer and 8 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), using a method that showed the highest recovery of RNA. Isolation of EVs concentrated micro-RNAs, reducing the cycle threshold (Ct) value of RT-qPCR amplification of micro-RNA such as miR-16 by 5.12 and miR-191 by 4.65, compared to the values before EV isolation. Normalization of target micro-RNAs was done using miR-191. For miR-221, the mean expression level of patients with localized PCa was significantly higher than that of the control group, having 33.45 times higher expression than the control group (p < 0.01). Area under curve (AUC) between BPH and PCa for miR-221 was 0.98 (p < 0.0001), which was better than AUC for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level in serum for the same patients. The levels of miR-21 and miR-141 in EVs did not show significant changes in patients with PCa compared to the control group in this study.

STAT3 is an oncogenic protein that was recently found to be activated in PCa tumors. This study aimed to investigate the radiosensitization effect of targeting STAT3 in PCa tumors. Here, the radiosensitization effect of STAT3 blockade was investigated by clonogenic assay, flow cytometry and western blot analysis in human PCa cells in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated that STAT3 blockade with a STAT3 inhibitor or siRNA increased the radiosensitivity of PCa cells and that radiation together with STAT3 blockade induced more apoptosis and double-strand breaks (DSBs) than radiation alone in LNCaP cells. In addition, radiation induced STAT3 activation and survivin expression in PCa cells, which was inhibited by STAT3 blockade. Transfection with survivin cDNA attenuated the radiosensitization effect of STAT3 blockade. These effects were further confirmed by in vivo studies, which showed that the STAT3 inhibitor enhanced the treatment efficacy of radiation on LNCaP xenografts with decreased STAT3 activation and survivin expression. These findings suggest that STAT3 blockade radiosensitizes PCa cells through regulation of survivin. Thus, our study has revealed STAT3 as a potential sensitizer for irradiation in PCa cells. Its clinical application as an adjuvant in radiotherapy of PCa should be explored in the future.""","""['Qu Zhang', 'Xiao-Mei Zhou', 'Shao-Zhong Wei', 'Dian-Sheng Cui', 'Kang-Li Deng', 'Gai Liang', 'Yan Luo', 'Bo Luo', 'Xin-Jun Liang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Radiat Res""","""['GLS-driven glutamine catabolism contributes to prostate cancer radiosensitivity by regulating the redox state, stemness and ATG5-mediated autophagy.', 'Cyclin D1 silencing suppresses tumorigenicity, impairs DNA double strand break repair and thus radiosensitizes androgen-independent prostate cancer cells to DNA damage.', 'Disruption of MEK/ERK/c-Myc signaling radiosensitizes prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'Torc1/Torc2 inhibitor, Palomid 529, enhances radiation response modulating CRM1-mediated survivin function and delaying DNA repair in prostate cancer models.', 'HZ08 suppresses RelB-activated MnSOD expression and enhances Radiosensitivity of prostate Cancer cells.', ""STAT3 and Its Pathways' Dysregulation-Underestimated Role in Urological Tumors.""]"""

In the last years, novel therapy regimens have been approved providing reasonable alternatives for DOC-resistant patients making prediction of DOC resistance of great clinical importance. We aimed to identify serum biomarkers, which are able to select patients who will not benefit from DOC treatment. DOC-resistant PC3-DR and DU145-DR sublines and their sensitive parental cell lines (DU145, PC3) were comparatively analyzed using liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Results were filtered using bioinformatics approaches to identify promising serum biomarkers. Serum levels of five proteins were determined in serum samples of 66 DOC-treated metastatic castration-resistant PC patients (mCRPC) using ELISA. Results were correlated with clinicopathological and survival data. CD44 was subjected to further functional cell culture analyses. We found at least 177 two-fold significantly overexpressed proteins in DOC-resistant cell lines. Our bioinformatics method suggested 11/177 proteins to be secreted into the serum. We determined serum levels of five (CD44, MET, GSN, IL13RA2 and LNPEP) proteins in serum samples of DOC-treated patients and found high CD44 serum levels to be independently associated with poor overall survival (p = 0.001). In accordance, silencing of CD44 in DU145-DR cells resulted in re-sensitization to DOC. In conclusion, high serum CD44 levels may help identify DOC-resistant patients and may thereby help optimize clinical decision-making regarding type and timing of therapy for mCRPC patients.

Patients with nerve-sparing approach were then stratified according to biopsy technique (PBx vs. MRI-PBx). Further, we compared PBx versus MRI-PBx according to SNR rate.  Results:   We included a total of 470 consecutive patients, who underwent RARP for PCa at our institution between January 2016 and December 2019. Patients with a preoperative MRI-PBx had a 2.12-fold higher chance of successful nerve-sparing (without SNR) compared to patients with PBx (p < 0.01).

Therefore, sensitive molecular tools are urgently needed for reliable treatment selection and response prediction. This study aimed to evaluate urinary miRNAs and blood circulating androgen receptor (AR) transcript level as a tool for noninvasive outcome prediction for CRPC patients undergoing abiraterone acetate (AA) therapy.  Methods:   Prostate cancer-specific miR-148a, -365, -375, and -429 were analyzed in 129 urine samples collected from 100 CRPC patients before and during AA therapy via quantitative reverse transcription PCR. To test the prognostic value, urinary miRNA levels alone, as well as combined with AR level were associated with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).  Results:   Level of urinary miR-375 was the highest in CRPC in comparison to noncancerous controls, as well as in combination with miR-429 was predictive for short PFS in AA-treated patients (HR = 2.2, 95% CI: 1.1-4.2, p = 0.023).

For PFS prediction a tandem of miR-429 and high AR reached HR of 5.0 (95% CI: 2.2-11.8, p < 0.001), while for prediction of OS the best combination was demonstrated by miR-148a and AR with HR of 3.1 (95% CI: 1.4-7.1, p = 0.006).

Cell division cycle‑associated 3 (CDCA3) is a known trigger of mitotic entry and has been demonstrated to be constitutively upregulated in tumors. It is therefore associated with carcinogenic properties reported in various cancers. However, the role of CDCA3 in prostate cancer is unclear. In the present study, western blotting and analysis of gene expression profiling datasets determined that CDCA3 expression was upregulated in prostate cancer and was associated with a poor prognosis. CDCA3 knockdown in DU145 and PC‑3 cells led to decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, with increased protein expression levels of cleaved‑caspase3. Further experiments demonstrated that downregulated CDCA3 expression levels induced G0/G1 phase arrest, which was attributed to increased p21 protein expression levels and decreased cyclin D1 expression levels via the regulation of NF‑κB signaling proteins (NFκB‑p105/p50, IKKα/β, and pho‑NFκB‑p65). In conclusion, these results indicated that CDCA3 may serve a crucial role in prostate cancer and consequently, CDCA3 knockdown may be used as a potential therapeutic target.""","""['Peng Gu', 'Minhao Zhang', 'Jin Zhu', 'Xiaoliang He', 'Dongrong Yang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Cell Division Cycle-Associated Protein 3 (CDCA3) Is a Potential Biomarker for Clinical Prognosis and Immunotherapy in Pan-Cancer.', 'CDCA3 mediates p21-dependent proliferation by regulating E2F1 expression in colorectal cancer.', 'CDCA3 promotes cell proliferation by activating the NF-κB/cyclin D1 signaling pathway in colorectal cancer.', 'Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) induced cell growth inhibition, G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Overexpression of cell cycle regulator CDCA3 promotes oral cancer progression by enhancing cell proliferation with prevention of G1 phase arrest.', '4‑Methoxydalbergione inhibits esophageal carcinoma cell proliferation and migration by inactivating NF‑κB.', 'CDCA3 Predicts Poor Prognosis and Affects CD8+ T Cell Infiltration in Renal Cell Carcinoma.', 'Pan-cancer analysis identifies CDCA3 as a novel prognostic marker associated with immune infiltration in lung adenocarcinoma through bioinformatics analysis.', 'Cell Division Cycle-Associated Protein 3 (CDCA3) Is a Potential Biomarker for Clinical Prognosis and Immunotherapy in Pan-Cancer.', '6-Methoxyflavone induces S-phase arrest through the CCNA2/CDK2/p21CIP1 signaling pathway in HeLa cells.']"""

However, prostatic schwannoma presenting with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and treated conservatively are extremely rare. Case presentation: Herein, we present a rare case of a prostatic schwannoma in a 65-year-old man who initially presented with an elevated PSA level. Digital rectal examination revealed an enlarged prostate with a palpable hard nodule on the left side. Transrectal ultrasonography revealed an enlarged prostate with a well-defined homogeneously hypoechoic nodule in the left peripheral lobe. Biopsy was done, and histopathology revealed a prostatic schwannoma. Conservative treatment with regular image follow-up was done per the patient's preference. Mild PSA progression but no worsening of symptoms was found in 6 years of follow-up. Conclusions: PSA elevation could be a rare presentation of prostatic schwannoma. Treatment options other than surgery, such as conservative treatment with close observation, could be feasible for these rare tumors and long-term survivorship can be achieved.""","""['Benjamin Chung Howe Lai', 'Hung-Jen Shih', 'Syuan-Hao Syu', 'Ke-Hsun Lin']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Yale J Biol Med""","""['Diagnosis of prostatic carcinoma: the yield of serum prostate specific antigen, digital rectal examination and transrectal ultrasonography.', 'Schwannoma of the prostate: ultrasonographic features.', 'Effects of rectal examination, prostatic massage, ultrasonography and needle biopsy on serum prostate specific antigen levels.', 'Incidental carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Evaluation of prostate specific antigen density and transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsies in 100 consecutive patients with a negative digital rectal examination and intermediate serum prostate specific antigen levels.']"""

Prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) remains the most used marker to follow-up patients under treatment, but only limited data are available about the prognostic role of its changes over time and the impact of response to subsequent therapies. This analysis aims to assess the prognostic role of the magnitude and velocity of PSA response in CSPC and describe how this may affect the outcome to subsequent treatment outcomes in CRPC.  Patients and methods:   A retrospective analysis was performed on patients with de novo CSPC referring to six oncology centers in Italy. Clinical and pathological features were recorded. PSA response (PSA50), defined as a decrease > 50% compared to baseline, PSA velocity (PSAv), defined as any decrease in PSA levels over time and the deep and fast PSA response (4mPSA50), defined as the PSA response reached within the threshold of 4 months from the beginning of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) have been evaluated for their impact on survival. Survivals were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared across groups using the log-rank test. Cox proportional-hazard models, stratified according to baseline characteristics, were used to estimate hazard ratios for overall survival (OS).  Results:   A totals of 94.4% of patients had PSA50, which was correlated to longer OS compared to patients without PSA50 (56.0 vs. 14.8 months; p<0.001). The median PSAv was 6.9 (ng/dl)/month, which was predictive for longer OS: Each decrease of 1 (ng/dl)/month was able to improve OS by 0.2% (HR=0.998, 95%CI=0.997-1.000; p=0.008). A total of 47.9% of patients reached 4mPSA50, with a median OS and progression-free survival (PFS) to ADT-based therapy of 101.0 and 23.4 months compared to 41.9 and 11.0 months for those who did not (p<0.001), respectively. The independent prognostic role of 4mPSA50 was retained even when evaluated in multivariable analysis adjusted for other baseline characteristics and early docetaxel for CSPC. In CRPC, 4mPSA50 evaluated during CSPC retains its prognostic role even if it does not predict a different outcome between patients treated with abiraterone/enzalutamide or taxanes.  Conclusion:   Achieving a deep and fast PSA response correlates with a better outcome in patients with de novo mCSPC, also positively influencing the prognosis of the subsequent first-line therapy for CRPC disease.""","""['Roberto Iacovelli', 'Chiara Ciccarese', 'Orazio Caffo', 'Ugo De Giorgi', 'Umberto Basso', 'Marcello Tucci', 'Claudia Mosillo', 'Marco Maruzzo', 'Francesca Maines', 'Chiara Casadei', 'Michele Milella', 'Giampaolo Tortora']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['Correlation of Prostate-specific Antigen Kinetics with Overall Survival and Radiological Progression-free Survival in Metastatic Castration-sensitive Prostate Cancer Treated with Abiraterone Acetate plus Prednisone or Placebos Added to Androgen Deprivation Therapy: Post Hoc Analysis of Phase 3 LATITUDE Study.', 'PSA provocation by bipolar androgen therapy may predict duration of response to first-line androgen deprivation: Updated results from the BATMAN study.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

While absorbed dose estimation is an important step in the characterisation of wider systemic radiation risks in nuclear medicine, uncertainties remain for novel radiopharmaceuticals such as 223Ra.  Methods:   24-Colour karyotyping was used to quantify the spectrum of chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes of ADRRAD patients at incremental times during their treatment. Dicentric equivalent frequencies were used in standard models for estimation of absorbed blood dose. To account for the mixed field nature of the treatment, existing models were used to determine the ratio of the component radiation types. Additionally, a new approach (M-FISHLET), based on the ratio of cells containing damage consistent with high-LET exposure (complex chromosomal exchanges) and low-LET exposure (simple exchanges), was used as a pseudo ratio for 223Ra:IMRT dose.  Results:   Total IMRT estimated doses delivered to the blood after completion of mixed radiotherapy (after 37 IMRT fractions and two [223Ra]RaCl2 injections) were in the range of 1.167 ± 0.092 and 2.148 ± 0.096 Gy (dose range across all models applied). By the last treatment cycle analysed in this study (four [223Ra]RaCl2 injections), the total absorbed 223Ra dose to the blood was estimated to be between 0.024 ± 0.027 and 0.665 ± 0.080 Gy, depending on the model used. Differences between the models were observed, with the observed dose variance coming from inter-model as opposed to inter-patient differences. The M-FISHLET model potentially overestimates the 223Ra absorbed blood dose by accounting for further PBL exposure in the vicinity of metastatic sites.  Conclusions:   The models presented provide initial estimations of cumulative dose received during incremental IMRT fractions and [223Ra]RaCl2 injections, which will enable improved understanding of the doses received by individual patients. While the M-FISHLET method builds on a well-established technique for external exposures, further consideration is needed to evaluate this method and its use in assessing non-targeted exposure by 223Ra after its localization at bone metastatic sites.""","""['Isabella Bastiani', 'Stephen J McMahon', 'Philip Turner', 'Kelly M Redmond', 'Conor K McGarry', 'Aidan Cole', ""Joe M O'Sullivan"", 'Kevin M Prise', 'Liz Ainsbury', 'Rhona Anderson']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Nucl Med Biol""","""['Impact of pre-treatment variables on the completion of 223radium-dichloride therapy in mCRPC patients with bone metastases.', 'The potential of 223Ra and 18F-fluoride imaging to predict bone lesion response to treatment with 223Ra-dichloride in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Optimal usage of radium-223 in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Calculation of radium-223 and actinium-225 α-emitter radiopharmaceuticals dose rates in treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Radium-223 for the treatment of bone metastases in castration-resistant prostate cancer: when and why.', 'High-LET radiation induces large amounts of rapidly-repaired sublethal damage.', 'High Resolution and Automatable Cytogenetic Biodosimetry Using In Situ Telomere and Centromere Hybridization for the Accurate Detection of DNA Damage: An Overview.']"""

Herein we examined exposure of normal human prostate stem-progenitor cells (SPCs) to 10 nM PFOA or PFOS using serial passage of prostasphere cultures. Exposure to either PFAS for 3-4 weeks increased spheroid numbers and size indicative of elevated stem cell self-renewal and progenitor cell proliferation. Transcriptome analysis using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) showed 1) SPC expression of PPARs and RXRs able to mediate PFAS effects, 2) the emergence of a new cell cluster of aberrantly differentiated luminal progenitor cells upon PFOS/PFOA exposure, and 3) enrichment of cancer-associated signaling pathways. Metabolomic analysis of PFAS-exposed prostaspheres revealed increased glycolytic pathways including the Warburg effect as well as strong enrichment of serine and glycine metabolism which may promote a pre-malignant SPC fate. Finally, growth of in vivo xenografts of tumorigenic RWPE-2 human prostate cells, shown to contain cancer stem-like cells, was markedly enhanced by daily PFOS feeding to nude mice hosts.

Material and methods:   The dose-effect relations of the urethra and bladder dose, separately, and GU toxicity grade ≥2 (CTCAE 3.0) up to five years after treatment were assessed. A mixed model analysis for repeated measurements was used, adjusting for age, diabetes mellitus, T-stage, baseline GU toxicity grade ≥1 and institute. Additionally, the association between the dose and separate GU toxicity subdomains were investigated.  Results:   Dose-effect relations were observed for the dose (Gy) to the bladder D2 cm3 and urethra D0.1 cm3, with adjusted odds ratios of 1.14 (95% CI 1.12-1.16, p < 0.0001) and 1.12 (95% CI 1.11-1.14, p < 0.0001), respectively. Additionally, associations between the dose to the urethra and bladder and the subdomains urinary frequency, urinary retention and urinary incontinence were observed.  Conclusion:   Further increasing the dose to the bladder and urethra will result in a significant increase in GU toxicity following EBRT.

Materials and methods:   We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of non-Hispanic White (NHW) and non-Hispanic Black (NHB) men aged between 55 and 69 years who responded to the PSA screening survey in the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data. Complex weighted logistic regression models were used to evaluate predictors of PSA screening.  Results:   Screening prevalence was 43% in veterans (95% CI 42%-45%) versus 40% in nonveterans (95% CI 39%-40%, p <0.001). Among nonveterans, the prevalence of PSA screening was significantly lower in NHB (34%, 95% CI 31%-37%) versus NHW men (40%, 95% CI 39%-41%, p <0.001). Among veterans, NHB men had a significantly higher screening prevalence (48%, 95% CI 43%-54%) versus NHW men (42%, 95% CI 41%-44%, p=0.04). In adjusted analysis, veteran status (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01-1.21, p=0.02) and NHB race (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.12-1.48, p <0.001) were significantly associated with receipt of PSA screening. Given that we found an interaction between veteran status and race (pint=0.03), a marginal analysis was performed. Compared to NHB nonveterans, NHB veterans had higher odds of undergoing PSA screening (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.11-1.91, p=0.01). However, this association was not demonstrated when comparing NHW veterans versus nonveterans (OR 1.06, CI 0.97-1.16, p=0.22).  Conclusions:   Veteran status and NHB race were found to be independent predictors of PSA screening. The interaction between veteran status and race suggests that access to health coverage available to veterans may mitigate racial differences in prostate cancer screening behaviors.

The viability of cells was assessed by MTT assay. Genes of interest were measured by RT-PCR and the radiosensitizing efficacy of RV on proliferating cancer cells was determined by clonogenic assay.  Results:   Ionizing radiation significantly reduced PC-3 viability, lowered stem cell markers and affected epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes expression at all doses (2, 4, 6 and 8 Gray). Resveratrol significantly decreased PC-3 viability and lowered stem cell markers and EMT genes expression at concentrations 35, 70 and 140 µM. Combining resveratrol treatment with ionizing radiation leads to significant reduction in cell viability and stem cell markers genes which was noticed with increasing the radiation dose when compared to ionizing radiation alone treated group.  Conclusion:   Resveratrol has a radiosensitizing effect, that ability is triggered by reducing the expression of cancer stem cell markers and affecting EMT markers. Resveratrol showed to be a good candidate for further studies as anticancer drug in the treatment of human prostate cancer.""","""['Sanaa A El-Benhawy', 'Mohmed I Morsi', 'Enayat I Fahmy', 'Moustafa A Soula', 'Fatma Al Zahraa Fh Khalil', 'Amal Refaat Arab']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['A radiosensitizer, gallotannin-rich extract from Bouea macrophylla seeds, inhibits radiation-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cells.', 'Inhibitory action of pristimerin on hypoxia‑mediated metastasis involves stem cell characteristics and EMT in PC-3 prostate cancer cells.', 'The Effect of Resveratrol and Quercetin on Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Pancreatic Cancer Stem Cell.', 'Markers of pancreatic cancer stem cells and their clinical and therapeutic implications.', 'Natural Radiosensitizers in Radiotherapy: Cancer Treatment by Combining Ionizing Radiation with Resveratrol.', 'Aspirin Restores Radiosensitivity in Cervical Cancer Cells by Inducing Mitotic Catastrophe through Downregulating G2/M Effectors.', 'The double homeobox a pseudogene 8 accelerates cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in colon cancer.']"""

However, the data about CD150 expression and function outside the hematopoietic system are limited. The aim of this pilot study was to examine the profile of mRNA expression of CD150 isoforms and the protein topology in highly and low malignant breast (BC) and prostate cancer (PC) cell lines.  Materials and methods:   The study was performed on BC T47D, MDA-MB-231, ВСС/Р and BC/ML cell lines and PC LNCap, Du-145 and PC-3 cell lines. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction was applied for study of CD150 isoforms mRNA expression and flow cytometry was used for determination of protein localization.  Results:   Analyzed BC cell lines did not express CD150 on the cell surface membrane (csCD150-), but more than 45% of cells were positive for CD150 cytoplasmic reaction (cyCD150+). The cyCD150 expression level in T47D cells of luminal BC subtype was higher than in basal BC cell lines MDA-MB-231, ВСС/Р and BC/ML. The PC cell lines expressed CD150 both on the cell surface and in cytoplasm. The highest number of csCD150+ and cyCD150+ cells was revealed in less aggressive androgen responsive, non-metastatic LNCap cell line. All studied BC and PC cell lines expressed mRNA of canonical transmembrane mCD150 and novel nCD150 isoforms but with different pattern of prevalence. Soluble CD150 isoform was revealed at the low level only in BCC/P BC cell line and LNCap, PC-3 PC cell lines.

This study explored predictors of and barriers to use.  Methods:   A prospective survey of 141 Australian prostate cancer survivors assessed sociodemographic, clinical, psychosocial, and attitudinal characteristics associated with intention to use, and subsequent use of online communities.  Results:   The sample was divided into current, past, and non-user groups. Current users reported more intent to use online communities and had higher levels of social support. Current and past users, and their close contacts, held a more positive attitude towards use. Non-users experienced more barriers to use, fewer life impacts due to health changes, and were more likely to live in rural or remote regions. According to current users online prostate cancer communities are too informal, to past users they are too time intensive, and non-users believe they are too shallow. The most critical barriers to use were finding a suitable community, time to use them, and being capable of talking about or articulating their illness on the Internet. While these forums allow men to share experiences, gain recognition and understanding, and receive information, they may lead men to becoming too preoccupied with their illness and feeling more concerned about the consequences of their disease.  Conclusion:   Improving attitudes towards online communities and reducing barriers to use may help better encourage men with unmet supportive care needs to seek help from these groups.

This study examined whether a lycopene intake-related racial disparity exists in reducing the risk of PCa in healthy adults. Data on healthy, cancer-free Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) men (n = 159) and Non-Hispanic White (NHW) men (n = 478) from the 2003 to 2010 NHANES dataset were analyzed. Total lycopene intake from daily diet, age, living status, race/ethnicity, education level, poverty income ratio, body mass index, and smoking status were studied as independent variables. The combination of total Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) level and the ratio of free PSA was set as criteria for evaluating the risk of PCa. Multivariable logistic regression was used in race-stratified analyses to compute odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) comparing high PCa risk with low PCa risk. We found, in the whole population, race/ethnicity was the only factor that influenced lycopene intake from the daily diet. NHB men consumed less lycopene than NHW men (3,716 vs. 6,487 (mcg), p = 0.01). Sufficient lycopene intake could reduce the risk of PCa (OR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.18-0.85, p = 0.02). Men aged between 66 and 70 had high PCa risk (OR: 3.32, 95% CI: 1.12-9.85, p = 0.03). Obesity served as a protective factor against the high risk of PCa (OR: 0.25, 95% CI: 0.12-0.54, p = 0.001). NHW men aged between 66 and 70 had a high risk of PCa (OR: 4.01, 95% CI: 1.02-15.73, p = 0.05). Obese NHW men also had lower risk of PCa (OR: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.07-0.47 p = 0.001). NHB men had a high risk of PCa compared to NHW men (OR: 2.27, 95% CI: 1.35-3.81 p = 0.004). NHB men who were living without partners experienced an even higher risk of PCa (OR: 3.35, 95% CI: 1.01-11.19 p = 0.07).

Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis demonstrated that RASAL2 is differentially hypermethylated in PCa tissues compared to benign prostate tissues. The PCR analysis of RASAL2 mRNA transcript showed differential expression in a panel of prostate cell lines with most PCa showing lower RASAL2 expression compared to benign prostatic epithelial cells. In PCa PC3 cells, the ectopic expression of RASAL2 significantly inhibited cell proliferation and invasion and induced an S phase plus G2/M phase cell cycle arrest. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) demonstrated a cross talk between RASAL2 and TNFα, a key cytokine in immune signaling pathway that is relevant in PCa. Over-expression of RASAL2 downregulated TNFα expression whereas the knockdown of RASAL2 caused increased expression of TNFα.

Methods:   The ubiquitin-protein and the ubiquitin coding gene UBA52, UBA80, UBB, and UBC expressions were detected in clinical tissues and cells. Overexpression and knockdown of UBC were performed in prostate cancer DU145 cells. Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK-8) assay was performed to detect cell proliferation. Cell cycle at 24 h was detected by flow cytometry. Clonal formation assay was used to measure cell clone number. Immunofluorescence (IF) was performed to detect the colocalization of SEPT6 and UBC in prostate cancer cells. Next, we overexpressed or knocked down SEPT6 expression in DU145 cells. Pearson correlation coefficient was applied to analyze the relationship between SEPT6 and UBC in prostate cancer tissue. oe-SEPT6+oe-UBC coexpressing cells were constructed to detect the upstream and downstream relationship between SEPT6 and UBC on prostate cancer cells. The tumor formation experiment was performed to explore SEPT6/UBC effect on prostate cancer.  Results:   UBC was upregulated in prostate cancer tissues and cells. Overexpression of UBC promoted cell survival and proliferation. IF revealed the colocalization of SEPT6 and UBC in prostate cancer cells. UBC expression decreased after oe-SEPT6, while increased after sh-SEPT6, indicating that UBC was downstream of SEPT6. Pearson correlation coefficient analysis showed that SEPT6 was negatively correlated with UBC in prostate cancer tissues. SEPT6 as an upstream gene of UBC regulated prostate cancer cell behavior through UBC. The tumor formation experiment showed that SEPT6 could inhibit tumor growth.

We examined cell fate decisions (proliferation, cell death, and senescence) in IKKε-depleted PC-3 cells, which exhibited delayed cell proliferation and a senescent phenotype, but did not undergo cell death. Using IKKε/TBK1 inhibitors, BX795 and Amlexanox, we measured their effects on cell fate decisions in androgen-sensitive prostate cancer and androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines. Cell-cycle analyses revealed a G2-M cell-cycle arrest and a higher proportion of cells with 8N DNA content in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells only. Androgen-independent prostate cancer cells also displayed increased senescence-associated (SA)-β-galactosidase activity; increased γH2AX foci; genomic instability; and altered p15, p16, and p21 expression. In our mouse model, IKKε inhibitors also decreased tumor growth of androgen-independent prostate cancer xenografts but not 22Rv1 androgen-sensitive prostate cancer xenografts.

Recent studies have demonstrated that circular RNAs (circRNA) play critical roles in the development and progression of prostate cancer. However, the biological roles and potential functions of circRNAs in mediating docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer have yet to be well elucidated. In this study, we analyzed the expression profiles of circRNAs in docetaxel-resistant and -sensitive prostate cancer cells through RNA sequencing and found that expression of circARHGAP29 was significantly upregulated in docetaxel-resistant cell lines and clinical samples. Ectopic expression of circARHGAP29 triggered docetaxel resistance and aerobic glycolysis in prostate cancer cells, which was reduced by silencing circARHGAP29. Moreover, eukaryotic initiation factor 4A3, which bound the back-spliced junction site and the downstream flanking sequence of circARHGAP29, induced cyclization and cytoplasmic export of circARHGAP29. circARHGAP29 increased the stability of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) mRNA by strengthening its interaction with insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2, leading to enhanced glycolytic metabolism. In addition, circARHGAP29 interacted with and stabilized c-Myc mRNA and protein, which further increased LDHA expression by facilitating its transcription. These findings reveal the crucial function of circARHGAP29 in prostate cancer glycolysis by increasing and stabilizing LDHA mRNA, providing a promising therapeutic target in docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer.

Among over a hundred index risk SNPs for prostate cancer, only a few can be verified using the available AAs' data. Their relevance to the prevalence inequality and other racial disparities has not been fully determined. We investigated this issue by an integrative analysis of five public datasets. We categorized the datasets into two classes. The training class consisted of the datasets generated by three genome-wide association studies. The test class contained the prostate adenocarcinoma data of The Cancer Genome Atlas and the data of African and European super-populations in the 1000-Genome project. The polygenic risk scores (PRS) of test samples for cancer occurrence were calculated according to the effects of genetic variants estimated from the training samples. We obtained the following findings. Africans' PRSs are higher than Europeans' scores (P < 1 × 10-6). AA patients' PRSs are higher than EA patients' scores (P < 3×10-9). The patients with tumors presenting fusion or abnormal expression in ERG and other E26 transformation-specific (ETS) family genes have lower PRSs than the patients without such aberrations (P < 7×10-5). Five tumor progression-related genes have the expression levels being significantly correlated with PRS (FDR < 0.01). Additional simulation analysis shows that the high prostate cancer prevalence in African populations makes it challenging to identify individual risk variants using African men's data. These results implicate that the index risk SNP-based PRS is compatible with the observed racial disparity in prostate cancer prevalence and ETS abnormal cancers may be less heritable compared with other subtypes.  Prevention relevance:   This study reveals the relevance of index risk SNP markers with racial disparities in prostate cancer.

The 153Sm, 32Р, and 89Sr radiopharmaceutical agents produced by the«Radiopreparats» enterprise (Republic of Uzbekistan) and Radioisotope Centre Polatom (National Centre for NuclearResearch, Poland) were administered to the patients. There were cases of breast cancer (n = 75), prostate cancer(n = 45), lung cancer (n = 10), kidney cancer (n = 4), cervical cancer (n = 5), and rectosigmoid cancer (n = 11) amongthe treated subjects. In 135 patients (90 %) the bone metastases were detected by osteoscintigraphy with 99мTc- mo-nodiphosphonate. In 15 cases the diagnosis of metastatic bone disease was verified by other radiology methods.  Results:   The pain intensity rating scale (LACOMED) was used to assay the analgesic effect of various radiopharma-ceuticals in metastatic bone disease. Results of treatment with 32P, 89Sr, and 153Sm were included in a comparativeanalysis procedure. It was established that the level of pain syndrome ranged from 7-8 points on the LACOMED scalebefore treatment. Upon administration of radionuclide therapy the level of pain was reduced down to 3-5 points,namely with 32P therapy it has decreased by 30.7 %, with 89Sr by 33.2 %, and with 153Sm by 41.5 % respectively. Timepattern of 153Sm analgesic effectiveness was studied depending on the number of treatment sessions. The best valueof analgesic effect of 153Sm was registered after the first treatment session with a tendency to decrease after the sec-ond and significantly lower analgesic effects after the third session. Tolerance of 153Sm was rated on the CTCNCA (v)4.3 scale. The best tolerance was peculiar to 153Sm corresponding to the «good» level according to a point assess-ment.

All patients underwent a comprehensive clinical examination, which included multiparametric MRI of the prostate, a component of which was biMRI. TheMRI data was evaluated according to the PIRADS system version 2.1.  Results:   The distribution of patients according to the PIRADS system was as follows: 1 point - 9 (11.54 %)patients, 2 points - 12 (15.38 %) patients, 3 points - 25 (32.05 %) patients, 4 points - 19 (24.36 %) patients and5 points - 13 (16.67 %) patients.

Methods:   Our study cohort included patients whose prostate biopsy (PB) or radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen demonstrated LAST between 2014-2021. Clinical variables including age, race/ethnicity, prostate specific antigen (PSA), and prostate weight were analyzed. Patients were assessed for clinical and laboratory evidence of systemic amyloidosis and lymphoproliferative conditions during the follow-up period.  Results:   Thirty-six men (26 RPs, 9 PBs, and 1 cystoprostatectomy) had LAST. Our study cohort included 18 white Hispanic, 9 white non-Hispanic, 7 black, and 1 Asian men.

In the genetically driven murine prostate carcinogenesis model transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP), prostate cancer is inhibited by feeding of lycopene or tomatoes, and these effects are modulated by the β-carotene oxygenase 2 (Bco2) genotype.  Objective:   We sought insight into this interaction through evaluation of prostate gene expression patterns during early TRAMP carcinogenesis.  Methods:   Three-week-old TRAMP/+ or TRAMP/- × Bco2+/+ or Bco2-/- mice were fed a control, lycopene beadlet, or 10% tomato powder-containing semipurified diet (providing 0, 384 and 462 mg lycopene/kg diet, respectively) for 5 wk. Gene expression patterns were evaluated by prostate cancer- and cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism-focused arrays at age 8 wk.  Results:   The TRAMP genotype profoundly alters gene expression patterns, specifically inducing pathways associated with cell survival [z-score = 2.09, -log(P value) = 29.2, p53 signaling (z-score 1.13, -log(P value) = 13.5], and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling [z-score = 0.302, -log(P value) = 12.1], while repressing phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) signaling [(z-score = -0.905, -log(P value) = 12.3], cholesterol synthesis [z-score = -1.941, -log(P-value) = 26.2], and LXR/RXR pathway activation [z-score = -1.941, -log(P value) = 23.1]. In comparison, lycopene- and tomato-feeding modestly modulate strong procarcinogenic TRAMP signaling. Lycopene decreased gene expression related to carcinogenesis [ Nkx3-1(NK3 homeobox 1)], tomato feeding increased expression of a gene involved in circadian regulation [Arntl (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator like)], and tomato and/or lycopene increased expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism [Fasn (fatty acid synthase), Acaca(acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha), Srebf1 (sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1), Hmgcr (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coA reductase), and Ptgs1 (prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1)] (all P < 0.05). The impact of Bco2 genotype was limited to a subset of lycopene-impacted genes [Apc (adenomatous polyposis coli), Mto1 (mitochondrial TRNA translation optimization 1), Nfkb1 (nuclear factor kappa B subunit 1), andRbm39 (RNA binding motif protein 39)].  Conclusions:   The TRAMP genotype strongly impacts procarcinogenic gene expression prior to emergence of histopathologic disease. Dietary tomato and lycopene modestly temper these processes, while Bco2 genotype has a limited impact at this early stage. These observed patterns provide insight into the complex interactions between a dietary variable, here tomatoes and lycopene, genes impacting nutrient metabolism, and their modulating influences on oncogene-driven prostate carcinogenesis. These findings provide further mechanistic support, consistent with cancer outcomes in rodents experiments and human epidemiologic studies.""","""['Nancy E Moran', 'Jennifer M Thomas-Ahner', 'Joshua W Smith', 'Ceasar Silva', 'Noor A Hason', 'John W Erdman', 'Steven K Clinton']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Nutr""","""[""β-Carotene 9',10' Oxygenase Modulates the Anticancer Activity of Dietary Tomato or Lycopene on Prostate Carcinogenesis in the TRAMP Model."", 'Dietary tomato and lycopene impact androgen signaling- and carcinogenesis-related gene expression during early TRAMP prostate carcinogenesis.', ""β-Carotene-9',10'-oxygenase status modulates the impact of dietary tomato and lycopene on hepatic nuclear receptor-, stress-, and metabolism-related gene expression in mice."", 'Tomatoes, Lycopene, and Prostate Cancer: What Have We Learned from Experimental Models?', 'Tomato products, lycopene, and prostate cancer risk.', 'Orchestration of miRNA Patterns by Testosterone and Dietary Tomato Carotenoids during Early Prostate Carcinogenesis in TRAMP Mice.']"""

However, race-specific differences in response to initial treatment remain unknown.  Objective:   To compare overall and treatment-specific outcomes of Black and White men with localized prostate cancer receiving definitive radiotherapy (RT).  Data sources:   A systematic search was performed of relevant published randomized clinical trials conducted by the NRG Oncology/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2010. This meta-analysis was performed from July 1, 2019, to July 1, 2021.  Study selection:   Randomized clinical trials of definitive RT for patients with localized prostate cancer comprising a substantial number of Black men (self-identified race) enrolled that reported on treatment-specific and overall outcomes.  Data extraction and synthesis:   Individual patient data were obtained from 7 NRG Oncology/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group randomized clinical trials evaluating definitive RT with or without short- or long-term androgen deprivation therapy. Unadjusted Fine-Gray competing risk models, with death as a competing risk, were developed to evaluate the cumulative incidences of end points. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate differences in all-cause mortality and the composite outcome of distant metastasis (DM) or death. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline was followed.  Main outcomes and measures:   Subdistribution hazard ratios (sHRs) of biochemical recurrence (BCR), DM, and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM).  Results:   A total of 8814 patients (1630 [18.5%] Black and 7184 [81.5%] White) were included; mean (SD) age was 69.1 (6.8) years. Median follow-up was 10.6 (IQR, 8.0-17.8) years for surviving patients. At enrollment, Black men were more likely to have high-risk disease features. However, even without adjustment, Black men were less likely to experience BCR (sHR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.58-0.91), DM (sHR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58-0.91), or PCSM (sHR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.54-0.97). No significant differences in all-cause mortality were identified (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.92-1.07). Upon adjustment, Black race remained significantly associated with improved BCR (adjusted sHR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.72-0.88; P < .001), DM (adjusted sHR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55-0.87; P = .002), and PCSM (adjusted sHR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.50-0.93; P = .01).  Conclusions and relevance:   The findings of this meta-analysis suggest that Black men enrolled in randomized clinical trials present with more aggressive disease but have better BCR, DM, and PCSM with definitive RT compared with White men, suggesting that other determinants of outcome, such as access to care, are important factors of achieving racial equity.""","""['Ting Martin Ma', 'Tahmineh Romero', 'Nicholas G Nickols', 'Matthew B Rettig', 'Isla P Garraway', 'Mack Roach rd', 'Jeff M Michalski', 'Thomas M Pisansky', 'W Robert Lee', 'Christopher U Jones', 'Seth A Rosenthal', 'Chenyang Wang', 'Holly Hartman', 'Paul L Nguyen', 'Felix Y Feng', 'Paul C Boutros', 'Christopher Saigal', 'Karim Chamie', 'William C Jackson', 'Todd M Morgan', 'Rohit Mehra', 'Simpa S Salami', 'Randy Vince', 'Edward M Schaeffer', 'Brandon A Mahal', 'Robert T Dess', 'Michael L Steinberg', 'David Elashoff', 'Howard M Sandler', 'Daniel E Spratt', 'Amar U Kishan']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Black Men Receiving Radiotherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer Have Improved Outcomes-Clinical Trial Access or Racial Advantage?', 'Association of Black Race With Prostate Cancer-Specific and Other-Cause Mortality.', 'Evaluation of Social Determinants of Health and Prostate Cancer Outcomes Among Black and White Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Analysis of a Biopsy-Based Genomic Classifier in High-Risk Prostate Cancer: Meta-Analysis of the NRG Oncology/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 9202, 9413, and 9902 Phase 3 Randomized Trials.', 'Dose-escalated radiotherapy for clinically localized and locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Race-dependent association of clinical trial participation with improved outcomes for high-risk prostate cancer patients treated in the modern era.', 'Comparing the outcomes of robotic assisted radical prostatectomy in black and white men: Experience of a high-volume center.', 'Impact of pharmacist-involved collaborative care on diabetes management in a primary healthcare setting using real-world data.']"""

Treatment was stratified by factors such as hospital, age group (<70 and ≥70 years), and D'Amico cancer risk classification. The outcomes were Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, adverse events (AEs), and mortality. The patient characteristics associated with the different treatment modalities were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression.We included 470 men from 7 Spanish tertiary hospitals (mean (standard deviation) age 67.8 (7.6) years), 373 (79.4%) of which received treatment (alone or in combination) as follows: surgery (n = 163; 34.7%); radiotherapy (RT) (n = 149; 31.7%); and hormone therapy (HT) (n = 142; 30.2%). The remaining patients (n = 97) were allocated to no treatment, that is, watchful waiting (14.0%) or active surveillance (5.7%). HT was the most frequently administered treatment during follow-up and RT plus HT was the most common therapeutic combination.

To assess heterogeneity in a minimally invasive manner, methods to perform single circulating tumour cell (CTC) genomics at high resolution are necessary. However, due to the rarity of CTCs, development of such methods is challenging. Here, we developed a modular single CTC analysis pipeline to assess intrapatient heterogeneity by copy number (CN) profiling. To optimize this pipeline, spike-in experiments using MCF-7 breast cancer cells were performed. The VyCAP puncher system was used to isolate single cells. The quality of whole genome amplification (WGA) products generated by REPLI-g and Ampli1™ methods, as well as the results from the Illumina Truseq and the Ampli1™ LowPass library preparation techniques, was compared. Moreover, a bioinformatic pipeline was designed to generate CN profiles from single CTCs. The optimal combination of Ampli1™ WGA and Illumina Truseq library preparation was successfully validated on patient-derived CTCs.

A large variety of PSMA ligands have been radiolabeled, to date. Among the various derivatives, PSMA-617 resulted to be one of the most interesting in terms of interaction with the antigen and clinical properties, and its lutetium-177 labeled version has recently been approved by regulatory agencies for therapeutic purposes. For this reasons, the radiolabeling with fluorine-18 of a PSMA-617 derivative might be of interest. Beside other methodologies to radiolabel macromolecules with fluorine-18, the ""click-chemistry"" approach resulted to be very useful, and the copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) is considered one of most efficient and reliable. This paper proposes the synthesis of a suitable precursor for the radiolabeling with fluorine-18 of a new PSMA-617 derivative.

This study aimed to compare the histopathology between MRI-detectable and MRI-undetectable cancers, emphasizing intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDC-P) and predominant Gleason pattern 4 subtype.  Methods:   This single-center retrospective study enrolled 153 consecutive patients with 191 lesions who underwent preoperative multiparametric MRI and subsequent radical prostatectomy. MRI/histopathological findings and area fractions of histological components (cancer cells, stroma, and luminal spaces) of MRI-detectable and MRI-undetectable cancers were compared. Data were analyzed using Fisher's exact, independent t, or Mann-Whitney U tests.  Results:   Overall, 148 (77%) and 43 (23%) cancers were MRI-detectable and MRI-undetectable, respectively. MRI-detectable cancers were significantly larger than MRI-undetectable cancers (p = 0.03). The percentage of lesions in Grade Group 3 or higher was significantly higher among MRI-detectable cancers than among MRI-undetectable cancers (p = 0.02). MRI detectability of csPCa was associated with increases in relative area fractions of cancer cells (p < 0.001) and decreases in those of stroma (p < 0.001) and luminal spaces (p < 0.001) in prostate cancer (PCa) than the percentage of Gleason pattern 4 (p = 0.09). The percentage of lesions containing IDC-P was similar for MRI-detectable and MRI-undetectable cancers (40% vs. 33%; p = 0.48). The distribution of cribriform gland subtypes was not significantly different between MRI-detectable and MRI-undetectable Gleason pattern 4 subtype cancers (p > 0.99). Contrarily, the ratio of fused gland subtype was significantly higher in MRI-detectable than in MRI-undetectable cancers (p = 0.03). Furthermore, the ratio of poorly-formed gland subtype was significantly higher in MRI-undetectable than in MRI-detectable cancers (p = 0.01).  Conclusions:   MRI detectability of csPCa is strongly associated with the relative area fractions of cancer cells, stroma, and luminal spaces in PCa rather than conventional histopathological parameters.

However, the literature still lacks studies identifying factors related to the SP learning curve and how to overcome the technological limitations, especially in terms of maintaining acceptable positive surgical margins (PSMs). This study describes our perioperative experience implementing a safe SP approach to radical prostatectomy (RP) while minimizing PSM, especially during the initial learning period. Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 100 consecutive patients with prostate cancer who underwent RP with the SP robot from June 2019 to December 2020 (IRB 237998). We accessed the perioperative data, pathology report, and short-term oncologic outcomes. We also represented our PSM trends in 100 consecutive cases, discussing potential factors for minimizing the learning curve impact on positive margins and outcomes. Medians and interquartile ranges, as well as frequencies and proportions, were reported for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Results and Limitations: The median follow-up is 14 months (8-17). The cohort has a median age of 62 years (56-68), median prostate-specific antigen of 5.5 (4.3-7.7), median preoperative Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) of 20, median American Urological Association (AUA) of 7 (3-11), and median body mass index of 25.4 (23.4-27.4). The median total operative time was 114 minutes (104-124), the median console time was 80 minutes (75-90). No intraoperative complications were reported. The overall rate of PSMs was 15% (5% were pT2 and 10% were pT3). Conclusions: The SP approach to RP is feasible, safe, and with acceptable intraoperative performance. In this study, we have described crucial factors for considering selection criteria in candidates for SP-robot-assisted RP. We believe that with an appropriate patient selection, this robot can be safely implemented without increasing positive margins and compromising the outcomes, especially during the learning curve period.""","""['Marcio Covas Moschovas', 'Sarah Kind', 'Seetharam Bhat', 'Jonathan Noel', 'Marco Sandri', 'Travis Rogers', 'Daniel Moser', 'Isabella Brady', 'Vipul Patel']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Comparing the Approach to Radical Prostatectomy Using the Multiport da Vinci Xi and da Vinci SP Robots: A Propensity Score Analysis of Perioperative Outcomes.', 'Early outcomes of single-port robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: lessons learned from the learning-curve experience.', 'Technical Modifications Necessary to Implement the da Vinci Single-port Robotic System.', 'Perioperative Outcomes Between Single-Port and ""Multi-Port"" Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Where do we stand?', 'Positive surgical margins after radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and contemporary update.', 'Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy with a single port platform: current and future perspectives of a referral center.', 'Contemporary techniques of da Vinci SP radical prostatectomy: multicentric collaboration and expert opinion.', 'Da Vinci SP radical prostatectomy: a multicentric collaboration and step-by-step techniques.']"""

Although the traditional competitive risk model can adjust the influence of other outcomes on the risk of the main outcome, it can not directly compare the differences on the risks of different outcomes. The multi-state competing risk model provides a relatively suitable solution for this problem. In this study, based on a previously published follow-up data set for prostate cancer patients, we developed traditional proportional hazard model, traditional competitive risk model, and multi-state competing risk model, respectively.

Due to the limited axial field of view of conventional PET scanners, whole-body dynamic 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT has not been performed. We investigated the time-activity curves (TACs) of prostate cancer pathological lesions and physiologic bladder activity to determine the optimal 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT imaging time by total-body (TB) PET/CT.  Methods:   Dynamic TB-PET performed on 11 patients with prostate cancer was analyzed. TACs were obtained by drawing regions of interest in normal organs and pathological lesions (primary prostate lesions and lymph nodes and bone metastases). We evaluated the 68 Ga-PSMA uptake pattern of normal organs, urinary bladder, and pathological lesions.  Results:   The urinary bladder TAC increased slowly between 180 and 330 s post-injection and then rapidly between 5.5 and 60.0 min post-injection. The pathological lesion uptake increased rapidly during the first 5 min post-injection and then slowly through the remaining 55 min. Six minutes post-injection was the optimal time with the highest pathological lesion SUVmean values still higher than the urinary bladder activity value. However, these prostate lesion, lymph node metastasis, and bone metastasis SUVmean values were one-third, one-half, and one-half the corresponding values 60 min post-injection, suggesting that early imaging might miss low PSMA uptake lesions. A minimum of 35 min post-injection was required for the pathological lesions to have SUVmean values similar to the corresponding values at 60 min post-injection (all P > 0.05), even though the pathological lesion SUVmean values showed a continuous upward trend through the 60 min.  Conclusions:   Combining early dynamic 68 Ga-PSMA PET (75-360 s) and conventional static imaging 60 min post-injection could avoid the urinary bladder activity interference to better detect pathological lesions and lesions with relatively low PSMA uptake. The pathological lesion SUVmean values at 35-59 min and 60 min post-injection were similar, so 68 Ga-PSMA PET imaging could also be made at 35-59 min post-injection.""","""['Jun Wen#', 'Yinjie Zhu#', 'Lianghua Li#', 'Jianjun Liu', 'Yumei Chen', 'Ruohua Chen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Early dynamic imaging in 68Ga- PSMA-11 PET/CT allows discrimination of urinary bladder activity and prostate cancer lesions.', 'Early PET imaging with 68Ga-PSMA-11 increases the detection rate of local recurrence in prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'Ga-68 Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen PET/CT: Imaging and Clinical Perspective in Prostate Cancer: Imaging and Clinical Perspective in Prostate Cancer.', 'Predicting the effect of different folate doses on 68GaGa-PSMA-11 organ and tumor uptake using physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling.', 'Diagnostic value of two-time point 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT in the primary staging of untreated prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric dynamic whole-body PSMA PET/CT using 68GaGa-PSMA-11 and 18FPSMA-1007.', 'An exploration of the feasibility and clinical value of half-dose 5-h total-body 18F-FDG PET/CT scan in patients with Takayasu arteritis.', 'Radiomics models for preoperative prediction of microvascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

We assessed the impact of the following covariates using univariate nonparametric and multivariate analysis: BMI, preoperative D'Amico risk classification, history of inguinal herniotomy, and previous abdominal operations. Results: We observed a statistically significant difference among our three BMI groups (<25, ≥25 and <30, and ≥30 kg/m2) regarding pelvic lymphadenectomy and LN metastasis.

Previous abdominal operations have been also demonstrated to significantly influence the pelvic lymphadenectomy. In addition, our multivariate model proved the impact of our covariates on pelvic lymphadenectomy. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the impact of BMI and preoperative risk on various steps of RARP.

To improve individual risk stratification, we examined the predictive value of selected proteins with respect to tumor heterogeneity and genomic instability. We assessed the degree of genomic instability in 50 radical prostatectomy specimens by DNA-Image-Cytometry and evaluated protein expression in related 199 tissue-microarray (TMA) cores. Immunohistochemical data of SATB1, SPIN1, TPM4, VIME and TBB5 were correlated with the degree of genomic instability, established clinical risk factors and overall survival. Genomic instability was associated with a GS ≥ 7 (p = 0.001) and worse overall survival (p = 0.008). A positive SATB1 expression was associated with a GS ≤ 6 (p = 0.040), genomic stability (p = 0.027), and was a predictor for increased overall survival (p = 0.023). High expression of SPIN1 was also associated with longer overall survival (p = 0.048) and lower preoperative PSA-values (p = 0.047). The combination of SATB1 expression, genomic instability, and GS lead to a novel Prostate Cancer Prediction Score (PCP-Score) which outperforms the current D'Amico et al. stratification for predicting overall survival. Low SATB1 expression, genomic instability and GS ≥ 7 were identified as markers for poor prognosis. Their combination overcomes current clinical risk stratification regimes.""","""['Christoph Dumke#', 'Timo Gemoll#', 'Martina Oberländer', 'Sandra Freitag-Wolf', 'Christoph Thorns', 'Axel Glaessgen', 'Rinse Klooster', 'Silvère M van der Maarel', 'Jerker Widengren', 'Christian Doehn', 'Gert Auer', 'Jens K Habermann']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Revised Gleason grading system is a better predictor of indolent prostate cancer at the time of diagnosis: retrospective clinical-pathological study on matched biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Tertiary Gleason pattern in radical prostatectomy specimens is associated with worse outcomes than the next higher Gleason score group in localized prostate cancer.', 'Associations between circulating carotenoids, genomic instability and the risk of high-grade prostate cancer.', 'Large scale genomic instability as an additive prognostic marker in early prostate cancer.', 'Significance and Importance of Pelvic Lymphadenectomy in Low-Risk Prostate Cancer Patients.']"""

An established modified citrus pectin (PectaSol®, P-MCP), a dietary polysaccharide, is an established antagonist of galectin-3, a carbohydrate-binding protein involved in cancer pathogenesis. Based on PSA dynamics, we report on the safety and the primary outcome analysis of a prospective phase II study of P-MCP in non-metastatic BRPC based. Sixty patients were enrolled, and one patient withdrew after a month. Patients (n = 59) were given P-MCP, 4.8 grams X 3/day, for six months. The primary endpoint was the rate without PSA progression and improved PSA doubling time (PSADT). Secondary endpoints were the rate without radiologic progression and toxicity. Patients that did not progress by PSA and radiologically at six months continued for an additional twelve months. After six months, 78% (n = 46) responded to therapy, with a decreased/stable PSA in 58% (n = 34), or improvement of PSADT in 75% (n = 44), and with negative scans, and entered the second twelve months treatment phase. Median PSADT improved significantly (p = 0.003). Disease progression during the first 6 months was noted in only 22% (n = 13), with PSA progression in 17% (n = 10), and PSA and radiologic progression in 5% (n = 3).

We have previously demonstrated that secreted extracellular nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (eNAMPT) is a multifunctional innate immunity regulator that promotes PCa invasion. In the current study, we further investigate the therapeutic effects of an eNAMPT-neutralizing humanized monoclonal antibody (ALT-100 mAb) in preclinical PCa orthotopic xenograft models. We utilized human aggressive PCa cells (DU145 or PC3) for prostate implantation in SCID mice receiving weekly intraperitoneal injections of either ALT-100 mAb or IgG/PBS (control) for 12 weeks. Prostatic tumors and solid organs were examined for tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis and for biochemical and immunohistochemistry evidence of NFκB activation. ALT-100 mAb treatment significantly improved overall survival of SCID mice implanted with human PCa orthotopic prostate xenografts while inducing tumor necrosis, decreasing PCa proliferation and reducing local invasion and distal metastases. The ALT-100 mAb inhibits NFκB phosphorylation and signaling in PCa cells both in vitro and in vivo. This study demonstrates that eNAMPT neutralization effectively prevents human PCa aggressive progression in preclinical models, indicating its high potential to directly address the unmet need for an effective targeted therapy for patients with aggressive PCa.""","""['Belinda L Sun', 'Lin Tang', 'Xiaoguang Sun', 'Alexander N Garcia', 'Sara M Camp', 'Edwin Posadas', 'Anne E Cress', 'Joe G N Garcia']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Pharmaceuticals (Basel)""","""['Role of secreted extracellular nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (eNAMPT) in prostate cancer progression: Novel biomarker and therapeutic target.', 'Endothelial eNAMPT amplifies pre-clinical acute lung injury: efficacy of an eNAMPT-neutralising monoclonal antibody.', 'Involvement of eNAMPT/TLR4 signaling in murine radiation pneumonitis: protection by eNAMPT neutralization.', 'Regulation and Function of Extracellular Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase/Visfatin.', 'Radioimmunotherapy of Metastatic Prostate Cancer with ¹⁷⁷Lu-DOTAhuJ591 Anti Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen Specific Monoclonal Antibody.', 'Linkage of NAMPT promoter variants to eNAMPT secretion, plasma eNAMPT levels, and ARDS severity.', 'The eNAMPT/TLR4 inflammatory cascade drives the severity of intra-amniotic inflammation in pregnancy and predicts infant outcomes.', 'eNAMPT/TLR4 inflammatory cascade activation is a key contributor to SLE Lung vasculitis and alveolar hemorrhage.', 'Biochemical and genomic identification of novel biomarkers in progressive sarcoidosis: HBEGF, eNAMPT, and ANG-2.', 'From Rate-Limiting Enzyme to Therapeutic Target: The Promise of NAMPT in Neurodegenerative Diseases.']"""
