Previously, these effects have been linked to the phosphorothioate (PS) backbone necessary to prevent rapid ASO degradation in plasma. The main aim of this study was to assess the impact of the nucleic acid portion of an ASO-type drug on platelets and determine if it may contribute to thrombosis or thrombocytopenia.  Methods:   Platelets were isolated from healthy donors and men with advanced prostate cancer. Effects of antisense oligonucleotides (ASO), oligonucleotides, gDNA, and microRNA on platelet activation and aggregation were evaluated. A mouse model of lung thrombosis was used to confirm the effects of PS-modified oligonucleotides in vivo.  Results:   Platelet exposure to gDNA, miRNA, and oligonucleotides longer than 16-mer at a concentration above 8 mM resulted in the formation of hypersensitive platelets, characterized by an increased sensitivity to low-dose thrombin (0.1 nM) and increase in p-Selectin expression (6-8 fold greater than control; p < 0.001). The observed nucleic acid (NA) effects on platelets were toll-like receptor (TLR) -7 subfamily dependent. Injection of a p-Selectin inhibitor significantly (p = 0.02) reduced the formation of oligonucleotide-associated pulmonary microthrombosis in vivo.  Conclusion:   Our results suggest that platelet exposure to nucleic acids independent of the presence of a PS modification leads to a generation of hypersensitive platelets and requires TLR-7 subfamily receptors. ASO studies conducted in cancer patients may benefit from testing the ASO effects on platelets ex vivo before initiation of patient treatment.""","""['Alexander Zaslavsky', 'Mackenzie Adams', 'Xiu Cao', 'Adriana Yamaguchi', 'James Henderson', 'Peter Busch-Østergren', 'Aaron Udager', 'Sethuramasundaram Pitchiaya', 'Benjamin Tourdot', 'Tadas Kasputis', 'Samuel J Church', 'Samantha K Lee', 'Sydney Ohl', 'Shivam Patel', 'Todd M Morgan', 'Ajjai Alva', 'Thomas W Wakefield', 'Zachery Reichert', 'Michael Holinstat', 'Ganesh S Palapattu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Thromb Res""","""['The mechanism of thrombocytopenia caused by cholesterol-conjugated antisense oligonucleotides.', 'Systematic Analysis of Chemical Modifications of Phosphorothioate Antisense Oligonucleotides that Modulate Their Innate Immune Response.', ""Hsp90 protein interacts with phosphorothioate oligonucleotides containing hydrophobic 2'-modifications and enhances antisense activity."", 'Antisense oligonucleotides: target validation and development of systemically delivered therapeutic nanoparticles.', 'Antisense oligonucleotides for the treatment of dyslipidaemia.', 'Platelet Activation by Antisense Oligonucleotides (ASOs) in the Göttingen Minipig, including an Evaluation of Glycoprotein VI (GPVI) and Platelet Factor 4 (PF4) Ontogeny.', 'EMERGING ROLE OF EXTRACELLULAR RNA IN INNATE IMMUNITY, SEPSIS, AND TRAUMA.', 'Targeting and delivery of microRNA-targeting antisense oligonucleotides in cardiovascular diseases.', 'Innate immune TLR7 signaling mediates platelet activation and platelet-leukocyte aggregate formation in murine bacterial sepsis.', 'Autoimmunity roots of the thrombotic events after COVID-19 vaccination.']"""

Especially in patients with complete motor paralysis, regaining the ability to walk is an important treatment goal. Our study, therefore, aimed to assess the neurological outcome of patients with MSCC and complete motor paralysis after decompressive surgery.  Methods:   Patients with MSCC and complete motor paralysis, surgically treated by decompressive surgery between 2004-2014 at a single institution were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical patient data were collected from medical records. To assess the neurological outcome, Frankel grade (FG) at admission and discharge were compared. Statistical analysis was performed to identify factors associated with an ambulatory status after surgery.  Results:   Twenty-eight patients were included in this study. The majority of metastases (57 %) were located in the thoracic spine and 75 % showed extraspinal tumor spread. The median interval between loss of ambulation and surgery was 35 h (IQR: 29-70). Posterior circumferential decompression without stabilization was performed in all cases within 24 h of admission. Neurological function improved in 17 patients (63 %) and seven (26 %) even regained the ability to walk following surgery. The rate of complications was low (7%). In statistical analysis, only the Karnofsky Performance Index (KPI) displayed a significant predictive value for an ambulatory status at discharge.  Conclusions:   Our findings indicate that severely affected MSCC patients with complete motor paralysis might benefit from decompressive surgery even when the loss of ambulation occurred more than 24 h ago.""","""['Alexander Younsi', 'Lennart Riemann', 'Basem Ishak', 'Moritz Scherer', 'Andreas W Unterberg', 'Klaus Zweckberger']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Clin Neurol Neurosurg""","""['Impact of decompressive laminectomy on the functional outcome of patients with metastatic spinal cord compression and neurological impairment.', 'Predictors of Postoperative Gain in Ambulatory Function After Decompressive Surgery for Metastatic Spinal Cord Compression.', 'Preoperative scoring and limits of prognostication: functional outcome after surgical decompression in metastatic spinal cord compression.', 'Decompression surgery for spinal metastases: a systematic review.', 'Clinical outcome of metastatic spinal cord compression treated with surgical excision ± radiation versus radiation therapy alone: a systematic review of literature.', 'Spinal oncologic paraparesis: Analysis of neurological and surgical outcomes in patients with intramedullary, extramedullary, and extradural tumors.']"""

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a structured multicomponent exercise program comprised of aerobic and resistance training as well as impact loading on the prevalence and severity of symptoms commonly resulting from androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and pelvic radiation therapy.  Methods and materials:   We performed a secondary analysis of pooled data from 2 randomized controlled trials that investigated the role of exercise on treatment-related side effects in patients with PCa receiving ADT. Patients were included in the analysis if they had undergone radiation therapy during the intervention in addition to ADT. Patient-reported quality of life and functional and symptom scales were assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and PR25 before and after 6 months of exercise or usual care (UC).  Results:   One-hundred and fifteen patients with PCa receiving ADT, aged 47 to 84 years, who also underwent radiation therapy were included in the analysis (exercise, n = 72; UC, n = 43). There was a significant reduction in physical functioning (P = .019) and increased fatigue (P = .007) in the control group, with no change observed in the exercise group. Similarly, there was a trend toward reduced sexual activity in the control group (P = .064), with a mean adjusted change of -7.1 points. Furthermore, the prevalence of clinically important pain at 6 months was lower in the exercise group compared with UC (18.1 vs 37.2%, P = .022). No between-group differences were found for urinary (P = .473) or hormonal treatment-related symptoms (P = .552).  Conclusions:   Exercise during concomitant hormone and radiation treatment for men with PCa may mitigate some adverse changes in patient-reported fatigue, physical functioning, and possibly sexual activity. The promotion and provision of exercise to counter a range of treatment-related adverse effects in patients with PCa undergoing radiation therapy and ADT should be actively encouraged.""","""['Oliver Schumacher', 'Daniel A Galvão', 'Dennis R Taaffe', 'Nigel Spry', 'David Joseph', 'Colin Tang', 'Raphael Chee', 'Robert U Newton']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['The role of exercise in the management of adverse effects of androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a rapid review.', 'Effects of Different Exercise Modalities on Fatigue in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Androgen Deprivation Therapy: A Year-long Randomised Controlled Trial.', 'Time on androgen deprivation therapy and adaptations to exercise: secondary analysis from a 12-month randomized controlled trial in men with prostate cancer.', 'Long-term effects of androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer patients.', 'Essential of Immediate Exercises on Cancer-Related Fatigue in Patients with Prostate Cancer Receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.', 'The Effect of Exercise on Pain in People with Cancer: A Systematic Review with Meta-analysis.', 'Update on Prevalence of Pain in Patients with Cancer 2022: A Systematic Literature Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Do Patients with Prostate Cancer Benefit from Exercise Interventions?

Niclosamide exhibits anti-cancer activity in multiple cancer types, including breast, colon, and prostate cancers. Niclosamide, a BCS II drug, is practically insoluble in water and sparingly soluble in organic solvents (ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide), leading to limited therapeutic applications, and necessitates the need for a drug carrier. Herein, we report the preparation of polydopamine nanoparticles loaded with niclosamide (Nic-PDA NPs). The designed formulation had a very high loading efficiency (~30%) and entrapment efficiency close to 90%. The average hydrodynamic diameter of Nic-PDA NPs was 146.3 nm, with a narrow size distribution (PDI = 0.039). The formulation exhibited a pH-dependent drug release profile, with ~35% drug released at pH 7.4 after 120 h, compared to > 50% at pH 5.5 in simulated physiological conditions. The NPs exhibited time-dependent cellular uptake and were primarily localized in the cytoplasm. The formulation exhibited comparable cytotoxicity in MDA-MB-231 cells (IC50 = 2.73 μM, 36 h), and inhibited the migration of cancer cells significantly compared to the free drug and unloaded PDA NPs. Furthermore, the unloaded NPs exhibited excellent in vivo compatibility. The study establishes a rigorously optimized protocol for the synthesis of Nic loaded PDA NPs. The biocompatibility, anti-migratory efficacy, and the in vivo non-toxic nature of PDA has been well demonstrated.""","""['Omkar Mhatre', 'B Pradeep K Reddy', 'Chetna Patnaik', 'Sabyasachi Chakrabarty', 'Aravind Ingle', 'Abhijit De', 'Rohit Srivastava']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Pharm""","""['Fortified anti-proliferative activity of niclosamide for breast cancer treatment: In-vitro and in-vivo assessment.', 'Redox-sensitive nanoparticles based on xylan-lipoic acid conjugate for tumor targeted drug delivery of niclosamide in cancer therapy.', 'In vitro/in vivo evaluation of pH-sensitive Gambogenic acid loaded Zein nanoparticles with polydopamine coating.', 'Mussel-Inspired Polydopamine: The Bridge for Targeting Drug Delivery System and Synergistic Cancer Treatment.', 'Application of polydopamine in tumor targeted drug delivery system and its drug release behavior.', 'Targeted Cancer Therapy via pH-Functionalized Nanoparticles: A Scoping Review of Methods and Outcomes.', 'Niclosamide-Clay Intercalate Coated with Nonionic Polymer for Enhanced Bioavailability toward COVID-19 Treatment.']"""

We aim to compare late toxicity profiles of patients with early-stage prostate cancer treated with moderately hypofractionated PBT and IMRT.  Methods and materials:   This multi-institutional analysis included patients with low- or intermediate-risk biopsy-proven prostate adenocarcinoma from 7 tertiary referral centers treated from 1998 to 2018. All patients were treated with moderately hypofractionated radiation, defined as 250 to 300 cGy per daily fraction given for 4 to 6 weeks, and stratified by use of IMRT or PBT. Primary outcomes were late genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. Adjusted toxicity rates were calculated using inverse probability of treatment weighting, accounting for race, National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk group, age, pretreatment International Prostate Symptom Score (GU only), and anticoagulant use (GI only).  Results:   A total of 1850 patients were included: 1282 IMRT (median follow-up 80.0 months) and 568 PBT (median follow-up 43.9 months). Overall toxicity rates were low, with the majority of patients experiencing no late GU (56.6%, n = 1048) or late GI (74.4%, n = 1377) toxicity. No difference was seen in the rates of late toxicity between the groups, with late grade 3+ GU toxicity of 2.0% versus 3.9% (odds ratio [OR] 0.47; 95% confidence interval 0.17-1.28) and late grade 2+ GI toxicity of 14.6% versus 4.7% (OR 2.69; confidence interval 0.80-9.05) for the PBT and IMRT cohorts, respectively. On multivariable analysis, no factors were significantly predictive of GU toxicity, and only anticoagulant use was significantly predictive of GI toxicity (OR 1.90; P = .008).  Conclusions:   In this large, multi-institutional analysis of 1850 patients with early-stage prostate cancer, treatment with moderately hypofractionated IMRT and PBT resulted in low rates of toxicity. No difference was seen in late GI and GU toxicity between the modalities during long-term follow-up.

However, symptom underascertainment in radiation therapy and characterization of patient groups at increased risk for underascertainment have not been examined.  Methods and materials:   As part of routine clinical care, 7 urinary and gastrointestinal symptoms were prospectively collected with both patient-report outcomes (PROs) using the validated Prostate Cancer Symptom Indices and physician-graded symptoms using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) for 544 consecutive patients from 2010 to 2018 who received intensity modulated radiation therapy to the prostate or prostate bed. Data from weekly treatment visits and the first posttreatment follow-up were analyzed. Underascertainment was defined as an occurrence when a clinically meaningful symptom was indicated on PROs but not physician CTCAE assessment. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression examined characteristics associated with underascertainment.  Results:   Overall, 85.3% of patients had underascertainment of at least 1 symptom. Per PRO, 16.9% of assessments reported clinically meaningful symptoms, in contrast to only 3.4% per CTCAE, representing an approximate 5-fold difference. Multivariable analysis showed underascertainment was more common in patients who were unmarried (odds ratio [OR] 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-1.38), lived in rural regions (OR 1.10; 95% CI, 1.01-1.21), incarcerated (OR 1.58; 95% CI, 1.36-1.84), retired/unemployed (OR 1.29; 95% CI, 1.18-1.40), received prostate gland (vs prostate bed) treatment (OR 1.43; 95% CI, 1.31-1.58), and received concurrent hormone therapy (OR 1.16; 95% CI, 1.04-1.29). Patients age >70 years were less likely to have underascertainment compared with those age <60 years (OR 0.82; 95% CI, 0.73-0.92).  Conclusions:   This is the first study to show underascertainment of clinically meaningful symptoms in radiation therapy patients in routine clinical care and further to demonstrate that certain patient groups are especially vulnerable to underascertainment. These results highlight the importance of incorporating PROs in the clinical care of radiation therapy patients. If PROs are not routinely used, vulnerable patient groups may need additional attention during cancer treatment to ensure accurate toxicity assessment and management.""","""['Shivani Sud', 'Brandon C Gerringer', 'Brandon S Wacaser', 'Xianming Tan', 'Sarah S Tatko', 'Trevor J Royce', 'Andrew Z Wang', 'Ronald C Chen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Patient-Reported Quality of Life During Prostate Cancer Radiation Therapy: Insights Into the Patient Experience.', 'Patient-reported Outcomes and Late Toxicity After Postprostatectomy Intensity-modulated Radiation Therapy.', 'Outcome and toxicity for patients treated with intensity modulated radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Patient-reported quality of life during definitive and postprostatectomy image-guided radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Acute and Late Adverse Events Associated With Radical Radiation Therapy Prostate Cancer Treatment: A Systematic Review of Clinician and Patient Toxicity Reporting in Randomized Controlled Trials.', 'Quality of life study in prostate cancer patients treated with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy: comparing late bowel and bladder quality of life symptoms to that of the normal population.', 'The cost of elective nodal coverage in prostate cancer: Late quality of life outcomes and dosimetric analysis with 0, 45 or 54\xa0Gy to the pelvis.', 'Feasibility, usability and acceptance of weekly electronic patient-reported outcomes among patients receiving pelvic CT- or online MR-guided radiotherapy - A prospective pilot study.']"""

Patients and methods:   We identified men who underwent primary radical prostatectomy for organ- confined prostate cancer over a 3-year period. Cancer foci on whole-mount histology were marked out, coding low-grade (LG; Gleason 3) and high-grade (HG; Gleason 4-5) components separately. Measurements of entire tumours were grouped according to intralesional proportion of HG cancer: 0%, <50% and ≥50%; the readings were corrected for specimen shrinkage and correlated with matching lesions on mpMRI. Separate measurements were also taken of HG cancer components only, and correlated against entire lesions on mpMRI. Size discrepancies were used to derive the optimal tumour size and treatment margins for FT.  Results:   There were 122 MRI-detected cancer lesions in 70 men. The mean linear specimen shrinkage was 8.4%. The overall correlation between histology and MRI dimensions was r = 0.79 (P < 0.001). Size correlation was superior for tumours with high burden (≥50%) compared to low burden (<50%) of HG cancer (r = 0.84 vs r = 0.63; P = 0.007). Size underestimation by mpMRI was more likely for larger tumours (51% for >12 mm vs 26% for ≤12 mm) and those containing HG cancer (44%, vs 20% for LG only). Size discrepancy analysis suggests an optimal tumour size of ≤12 mm and treatment margins of 5-6 mm for FT. For tumours ≤12 mm in diameter, applying 5- and 6-mm treatment margins would achieve 98.6% and 100% complete tumour ablation, respectively. For tumours of all sizes, using the same margins would ablate >95% of the HG cancer components.

GV1001, a human telomerase reverse transcriptase catalytic subunit, is an injectable formulation used as a cancer vaccine. It functions as a cell penetrating peptide to regulate cell proliferation. Here, we found that GV1001 effectively suppressed proliferation of prostatic stromal myofibroblasts (WPMY-1) and prostatic epithelial cells (RWPE-1 and WPE-NA22) treated with dihydrotestosterone. Also, GV1001 bound to androgen receptors (ARs) in the cytosol of stromal and epithelial cells. In an experimental animal model implanted with an infusion pump for spontaneous and continuous release of testosterone, revealed that GV1001 reduced prostatic hypertrophy and inhibited the cell proliferation and the expression of Ki67, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and prostate specific antigen. In addition, GV1001 prevented fibrosis of the prostate by downregulating expression of prostatic epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, Snail, Slug, N-cadherin, and Vimentin, and by up-regulating E-cadherin.

It may also reduce risk and severity of side effects associated with chemical castration in prostate cancer (PCa) patients. One of the earliest comprehensively documented clinical trials on this was reported in a Canadian patient population treated with leuprorelin preceded by a lead-in with cyproterone acetate. A systems-based mixed effect analysis of testosterone response in active and recovery phases allows inference of new information from this patient population. Efficacy of androgen deprivation therapy is presumed to depend on a treshold value for testosterone at the nadir, below which no additional beneficial effects on PSA reponse can be expected, and occurance of testosterone breakthroughs during active therapy. The present analysis results in a mixed effect model, incorporating GnRH receptor activation, testosterone turnover and feedback mechanisms, describing and predicting testosterone inhibition under intermittent androgen deprivation therapy on the individual and population level, during multiple years of therapy. Testosterone levels in these patients decline over time with an estimated first order rate constant of 0.083 year-1(T1/2 = 8.4 y), with a substantial distribution among this patient population, compared to the general population. PCa patients leaving the trial due to unmanageble PSA relapse appear to have slightly higher testosterone levels at the nadir than sustained responders.

Objective:   To determine whether MRI with only targeted biopsy was noninferior to systematic TRUS biopsies in the detection of International Society of Urological Pathology grade group (GG) 2 or greater prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   This multicenter, prospective randomized clinical trial was conducted in 5 Canadian academic health sciences centers between January 2017 and November 2019, and data were analyzed between January and March 2020. Participants included biopsy-naive men with a clinical suspicion of prostate cancer who were advised to undergo a prostate biopsy. Clinical suspicion was defined as a 5% or greater chance of GG2 or greater prostate cancer using the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial Risk Calculator, version 2. Additional criteria were serum prostate-specific antigen levels of 20 ng/mL or less (to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1) and no contraindication to MRI.  Interventions:   Magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsy (MRI-TB) only if a lesion with a Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS), v 2.0, score of 3 or greater was identified vs 12-core systematic TRUS biopsy.  Main outcome and measures:   The proportion of men with a diagnosis of GG2 or greater cancer. Secondary outcomes included the proportion who received a diagnosis of GG1 prostate cancer; GG3 or greater cancer; no significant cancer but subsequent positive MRI results and/or GG2 or greater cancer detected on a repeated biopsy by 2 years; and adverse events.  Results:   The intention-to-treat population comprised 453 patients (367 [81.0%] White, 19 [4.2%] African Canadian, 32 [7.1%] Asian, and 10 [2.2%] Hispanic) who were randomized to undergo TRUS biopsy (226 [49.9%]) or MRI-TB (227 [51.1%]), of which 421 (93.0%) were evaluable per protocol. A lesion with a PI-RADS score of 3 or greater was detected in 138 of 221 men (62.4%) who underwent MRI, with 26 (12.1%), 82 (38.1%), and 30 (14.0%) having maximum PI-RADS scores of 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Eighty-three of 221 men who underwent MRI-TB (37%) had a negative MRI result and avoided biopsy. Cancers GG2 and greater were identified in 67 of 225 men (30%) who underwent TRUS biopsy vs 79 of 227 (35%) allocated to MRI-TB (absolute difference, 5%, 97.5% 1-sided CI, -3.4% to ∞; noninferiority margin, -5%). Adverse events were less common in the MRI-TB arm. Grade group 1 cancer detection was reduced by more than half in the MRI arm (from 22% to 10%; risk difference, -11.6%; 95% CI, -18.2% to -4.9%).

Updated reports are important in providing mature data.  Objectives:   To evaluate the proportion of phase 3 RCTs for cancer that are updated and the factors that are associated with updating them and, for updated trials, to compare initial and updated results.  Design, setting, and participants:   This study identified reports of 2-group RCTs with a sample size of at least 100, published in 6 major journals between 1990 and 2010, that evaluated drug treatments for breast, lung, or prostate cancer. PubMed and abstracts of large cancer conferences were searched to identify updated (or earlier) reports of the same trials published up to 2019. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with the provision of updated reports. The hazard ratios defining the relative treatment effects for the primary and secondary end points between the initial and updated reports were compared.  Main outcomes and measures:   Proportion of RCTs whose results are updated, factors associated with updating, and change in hazard ratio for the primary end point between initial and updated reports.  Results:   A total of 207 RCTs met the inclusion criteria, and 41 (20%) were found to have updated reports. The factors significantly associated with an update included positive trial results (odds ratio [OR], 8.7 [95% CI, 3.3-23.3]), larger trial size (OR, 1.0006 [95% CI, 1.0000-1.0012]), evaluation of hormonal agents (OR, 5.8 [95% CI, 1.6-21.8]) or targeted agents (OR, 4.3 [95% CI, 1.3-14.6]) compared with chemotherapy, and evaluation of adjuvant therapy rather than therapy for advanced disease (OR, 8.0 [95% CI, 2.9-21.9]). For 31 trials for which initial and updated hazard ratios for the primary end point were available, the median hazard ratio increased from 0.66 (95% CI, 0.22-1.20) to 0.74 (95% CI, 0.32-1.19) (P < .001), indicating a decreased level of effectiveness.  Conclusions and relevance:   Only 20% of reports of phase 3 clinical trials for breast, lung, and prostate cancer were updated.

Worldwide, an estimated 19.3 million new cancer cases (18.1 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and almost 10.0 million cancer deaths (9.9 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) occurred in 2020. Female breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases (11.7%), followed by lung (11.4%), colorectal (10.0 %), prostate (7.3%), and stomach (5.6%) cancers. Lung cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18%), followed by colorectal (9.4%), liver (8.3%), stomach (7.7%), and female breast (6.9%) cancers. Overall incidence was from 2-fold to 3-fold higher in transitioned versus transitioning countries for both sexes, whereas mortality varied <2-fold for men and little for women. Death rates for female breast and cervical cancers, however, were considerably higher in transitioning versus transitioned countries (15.0 vs 12.8 per 100,000 and 12.4 vs 5.2 per 100,000, respectively). The global cancer burden is expected to be 28.4 million cases in 2040, a 47% rise from 2020, with a larger increase in transitioning (64% to 95%) versus transitioned (32% to 56%) countries due to demographic changes, although this may be further exacerbated by increasing risk factors associated with globalization and a growing economy. Efforts to build a sustainable infrastructure for the dissemination of cancer prevention measures and provision of cancer care in transitioning countries is critical for global cancer control.""","""['Hyuna Sung', 'Jacques Ferlay', 'Rebecca L Siegel', 'Mathieu Laversanne', 'Isabelle Soerjomataram', 'Ahmedin Jemal', 'Freddie Bray']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""CA Cancer J Clin""","""['Global cancer statistics 2018: GLOBOCAN estimates of incidence and mortality worldwide for 36 cancers in 185 countries.', 'Global cancer statistics, 2012.', 'Global patterns and trends in colorectal cancer incidence and mortality.', 'Global Burden of Urologic Cancers, 1990-2013.', 'Cancer in sub-Saharan Africa in 2020: a review of current estimates of the national burden, data gaps, and future needs.', 'Relationship between cancer stem cell-related SNPs and survival outcomes in patients with primary lung cancer.', 'Prediction of nonsentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients based on machine learning.', 'Identification of potential DNA methylation biomarkers related to diagnosis in patients with bladder cancer through integrated bioinformatic analysis.', 'Overall survival of patients with thyroid cancer in Martinique (2008-2018).', 'Efficacy and safety of transarterial chemoembolization plus lenvatinib with or without programmed death-1 inhibitors in the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Glutamate-Urea-R (Glu-Urea-R) is a PSMA enzyme inhibitor capable of binding to this surface marker of prostate cancer cell in an efficient and special manner. The aim of this project was to develop a docetaxel-loaded nanoparticle of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) polyethylene glycol which is cojugated to a urea-based anti-PSMA ligand named glutamate-urea-lysine (glu-urea-lys) for targeted delivery of docetaxel in prostate cancer. The obtained nanoparticles, prepared by nanoprecipitation method, were spheres with a particle size of around 150 nm and zeta potential of -7.08 mV. Uptake studies on the PC3 (as PSMA negative) and LNCaP (as PSMA positive) cells demonstrated that drug uptake was efficient by the PSMA positive cells. IC50 of targeted NPs on LNCaP cell line compared to non-targeted ones was reduced by more than 70% in three different incubation times of 24, 48, and 72 h.

The α-emitter 223Ra creates DNA damage tracks along α-particle trajectories (α-tracks) in exposed cells that can be revealed by immunofluorescent staining of γ-H2AX+53BP1 DNA double-strand break markers. We investigated the time- and absorbed dose-dependency of the number of α-tracks in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients undergoing their first therapy with [223Ra]RaCl2.  Methods:   Multiple blood samples from nine prostate cancer patients were collected before and after administration of [223Ra]RaCl2, up to 4 weeks after treatment. γ-H2AX- and 53BP1-positive α-tracks were microscopically quantified in isolated and immuno-stained PBMCs.  Results:   The absorbed doses to the blood were less than 6 mGy up to 4 h after administration and maximally 16 mGy in total. Up to 4 h after administration, the α-track frequency was significantly increased relative to baseline and correlated with the absorbed dose to the blood in the dose range < 3 mGy. In most of the late samples (24 h - 4 weeks after administration), the α-track frequency remained elevated.  Conclusion:   The γ-H2AX+53BP1 assay is a potent method for detection of α-particle-induced DNA damages during treatment with or after accidental incorporation of radionuclides even at low absorbed doses.

The effect of miR-183-5p on the survival and recurrence of osteosarcoma patients was analyzed in a cohort of 80 patients using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analysis. Effects of miR-183-5p on cell proliferation, migration and invasion abilities were evaluated using CCK-8, crystal violet and transwell assays.  Results:   The expression of miR-183-5p was found to be upregulated in human osteosarcoma tissues and cell lines. Moreover, miR-183-5p expression was observed to be closely associated with tumor size, TNM stage and lung metastasis. Notably, high expression of miR-183-5p was shown to be able to predict unfavorable clinical prognosis in osteosarcoma patients. Additionally, whilst overexpression of miR-183-5p was observed to significantly promote the proliferation, migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells; an inhibitory effect was observed with knockdown of miR-183-5p.

Whether their consumption is associated with cardiovascular mortality remains controversial. Moreover, data on ultra-processed foods and cardiovascular outcomes are scarce in the US population. We aimed to examine the association of ultra-processed food consumption with cardiovascular mortality in a US population.  Methods:   A population-based cohort of 91,891 participants was identified from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Dietary data were collected through a validated 137-item food frequency questionnaire. Ultra-processed foods were defined by the NOVA classification. Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for cardiovascular mortality. Restricted cubic spline regression was used to test nonlinearity. Subgroup analyses were conducted to identify the potential effect modifiers.  Results:   After an average follow-up of 13.5 years (1,236,049.2 person-years), 5490 cardiovascular deaths were documented, including 3985 heart disease deaths and 1126 cerebrovascular deaths. In the fully adjusted model, participants in the highest vs. the lowest quintiles of ultra-processed food consumption had higher risks of death from cardiovascular disease (HRquintile 5 vs. 1, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.36-1.64) and heart disease (HRquintile 5 vs. 1, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.50-1.87) but not cerebrovascular disease (HRquintile 5 vs. 1, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.76-1.17). A nonlinear dose-response pattern was observed for overall cardiovascular and heart disease mortality (all Pnonlinearity < 0.05), with a threshold effect observed at ultra-processed food consumption of 2.4 servings/day and 2.3 servings/day, respectively; below the thresholds, no significant associations were observed for these two outcomes. Subgroup analyses showed that the increased risks of mortality from ultra-processed foods were significantly higher in women than in men (all Pinteraction < 0.05).

Materials and methods:   Between 2013 and 2017, 64 intermediate and 166 high risk (230) prostate cancer patients received 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET followed by radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection. Biochemical recurrence-free and therapy-free survivalwere determined. For all time-to-event analyses, univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models and univariable Kaplan-Meier analyses were applied, with a significance threshold of p <0.05.  Results:   The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of PSMA PET for pN1 disease was 48.5%, 95.7%, 82.1% and 82.2%, respectively. Median followup was 30.2 months. Biochemical recurrence occurred in 50.4% (116) of patients and adjuvant or salvage treatment was performed in 46.5% (107). Worst biochemical recurrence-free and therapy-free survival was observed in pN1 patients who also exhibited PSMA PET positive lymph node, followed by pN1 patients without PSMA PET positive lymph node and patients without evidence of lymph node metastasis on histology and PSMA PET (median biochemical recurrence-free survival 1.7 vs. 7.5 vs. >36 months, median therapy-free survival 2.6 vs. 8.9 vs. >36 months).  Conclusions:   Patients with positive lymph node on PSMA PET prior to radical prostatectomy have to expect early biochemical recurrence and adjuvant/salvage therapy, despite thorough pelvic lymph node dissection.

Results:   Inclusion criteria were not having any neo-adjuvant treatment and being treated with surgery after needle biopsy. Gleason scores obtained from needle biopsies and prostatectomy specimens were evaluated. The comparison revealed that 39% of the tumors were undergraded, 7% were overgraded, and 54% had exact scoring in needle biopsies and prostatectomy specimens according to the detailed Gleason scoring as primary and secondary metrics. The patients were grouped into five categories according to the ISUP 2014 prostate cancer grading system. The relationship was strong with 64% of results staying in the same group after the operation; neverthe- less, the correlation remained weak based on the kappa coefficient.

Methods: Two cases of primary extragonadal germ cell tumor in the prostate were collected at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, in January and September 2016, respectively. Their pathological features, clinical treatments and follow-up were retrospectively analyzed. Results: The two patients were 41 and 32 years old, respectively, and both presented with obstructive symptoms of the lower urinary tract. Histologically, both cases showed small round blue cells and an invasive growth pattern. The immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains of SALL4, OCT3/4, CD117 and PLAP were all positive, while those of PSA, AR and syn were negative. Moreover, case 1 demonstrated perinuclear dot-like staining for CKpan, which might be a diagnostic pitfall. There was no evidence of disease in other areas via physical examination or radiographic studies. Based on these IHC findings and the morphology, the two cases were diagnosed as primary seminoma of the prostate, which were consequently treated with six cycles of bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin-based chemotherapy. A complete response was achieved in case 1. Case 2 was followed up and showed tumor recurrence, and progression with elevated tumor marker AFP. The subsequent radical removed specimens of case 2 were finally diagnosed as mixed germ cell tumor of the prostate. Conclusion: As a rare neoplastic entity, primary germ cell tumor of the prostate can show small blue round cell morphology. Pathologically, the morphology of small round blue cells combined with a perinuclear dot-like pattern of CKpan IHC staining may be a diagnostic pitfall.

The main complications associated with RARP include urinary incontinence and sexual dysfunction. In addition, acute urinary retention (AUR) after urethral catheter removal is sometimes seen. Early catheter removal is a risk factor for AUR, and administration of alphablockers before catheter removal reduces the occurrence of AUR. However, the ideal management of AUR after RARP is not known. Here we report the clinical course and treatment after AUR. We performed 279 RARPs at our institution, and AUR developed in 11 cases. In all cases, urination status was improved after placement of a urinary catheter or intermittent catheterization. Later, urethral stricture was seen in 2 out of 11 cases. Ourstudy suggests that when AUR is observed afterRARP, catheterur ination should be initially performed. If urinary retention recurs, a urinary catheter should be placed with administration of alpha-blockers.

We aimed to investigate the predictive value of peripheral monocyte count (PMC) for LNM of PCa in this study. Two hundred and ninety-eight patients from three centers were divided into a training set (n = 125) and a validation set (n = 173). In the training set, the independent predictors of LNM were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, and the optimal cutoff value was calculated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The sensitivity and specificity of the optimal cutoff were authenticated in the validation cohort. Finally, a nomogram based on the PMC was constructed for predicting LNM. Multivariate analyses of the training cohort demonstrated that clinical T stage, preoperative Gleason score, and PMC were independent risk factors for LNM. The subsequent ROC analysis showed that the optimal cutoff value of PMC for diagnosing LNM was 0.405 × 109 l-1 with a sensitivity of 60.0% and a specificity of 67.8%. In the validation set, the optimal cutoff value showed significantly higher sensitivity than that of conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (0.619 vs 0.238, P < 0.001).

Race and FH of PC were self-reported on questionnaires. Logistic regression was used to test the association between FH and PC diagnosis overall and by tumor aggressiveness [high- (Grade Group 3-5) or low-grade (Grade Group 1-2) vs. no cancer], overall, and stratified by race.

Of the four RCC subtypes, clear cell RCC (ccRCC) is the most common subtype and accounts for 75-80% of all RCC cases. SMARCC1, also known as BAF155, together with SMARCA4, SMARCA2, and SMARCB1, comprises the SWI/SNF protein family. It has been reported that the expression of SMARCC1 was correlated with some human cancers including prostate cancer, colon cancer, and pancreatic cancer. However, the mechanisms and regulatory roles of SMARCC1 in ccRCC are not well defined.  Methods:   Our current study primarily investigated the expression of SMARCC1 and its clinical importance in two common histological types of ccRCC using microarrays (HKidE180Su02, MecDNA-HKidE030CS01).  Results:   The results showed that the expression of SMARCC1 in ccRCC tissues was significantly decreased compared with that in corresponding para-tumor tissue (4.370±2.036 vs. 6.167±1.162, P=0.001). SMARCC1 expression was positively correlated with pathological grade (r=0.224, P=0.011). Moreover, ccRCC patients with high SMARCC1 expression had a better prognosis than those with low SMARCC1 expression (40.0% vs. 95.2%, P=0.000) in the following sub-groups: pathological grade (III and IV), male sex (73.5% vs. 95.3%, P=0.004), and tumor size >5 cm (62.5% vs. 89.5%, P=0.044).

Several studies have indicated the prognostic value of fibrinogen (Fib) and D-dimer (DD) in prostate cancer (PCa). However, it remains unclear regarding the association of the comprehensive coagulation markers with the clinicopathological features of PCa.  Methods:   A total of 423 pathologically diagnosed patients with PCa were consecutively collected and stratified as low-intermediate-risk or high-risk groups. The association of coagulation parameters including Fib, DD, prothrombin (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), and antithrombin III (AT-III) with clinicopathological features was determined by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses.  Results:   The levels of Fib, DD, and PT were significantly higher in the high-risk group (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, and p = 0.043, resp.), while APTT, TT, and AT-III were similar between two groups (p > 0.05, all). Univariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that Fib, DD, and PT were all positively correlated with high-risk PCa (OR = 2.041, p < 0.001; OR = 1.003, p < 0.001; OR = 1.247, p = 0.044). Nonetheless, after adjusting for PSA, grade, and stage, Fib (T3 vs. T1, OR = 15.202, 95% CI: 1.725-133.959, p = 0.014) but not DD or PT was the unique independent factor associated with high-risk PCa in the multivariate regression analysis.

Both studies concluded that most human PC can be assigned to one of three tumor subtypes, two categorized as luminal and one as basal, suggesting the two methods reflect consistency in underlying biology. Despite the similarity, differences and commonalities between the two classification methods have not yet been reported.  Methods:   Here, we describe a comparison of the PCS and PAM50 classification systems. PCS and PAM50 signatures consisting of 37 (PCS37) and 50 genes, respectively, were used to categorize 9,947 PC patients into PCS and PAM50 classes. Enrichment of hallmark gene sets and luminal and basal marker gene expression were assessed in the same datasets. Finally, survival analysis was performed to compare PCS and PAM50 subtypes in terms of clinical outcomes.  Results:   PCS and PAM50 subtypes show clear differential expression of PCS37 and PAM50 genes. While only three genes are shared in common between the two systems, there is some consensus between three subtype pairs (PCS1 versus Luminal B, PCS2 versus Luminal A, and PCS3 versus Basal) with respect to gene expression, cellular processes, and clinical outcomes. PCS categories displayed better separation of cellular processes and luminal and basal marker gene expression compared to PAM50. Although both PCS1 and Luminal B tumors exhibited the worst clinical outcomes, outcomes between aggressive and less aggressive subtypes were better defined in the PCS system, based on larger hazard ratios observed.  Conclusion:   The PCS and PAM50 classification systems are similar in terms of molecular profiles and clinical outcomes.

Biomarkers to predict Docetaxel toxicity may help optimize treatment selection. We aimed to create a predictive model for toxicity-related Docetaxel discontinuation (TRDD).  Methods:   Through Project Data Sphere, we accessed individual patient data from the control arms of three frontline mCRPC trials: ASCENT2, VENICE, and MAINSAIL. The inclusion criteria for these trials were all similar and included patients with chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC. The primary outcome was occurrence of TRDD. A competing risks regression (CRR) was used to predict TRDD, after accounting for the occurrence of competing events (death or progression). The output of the model was used as the dependent variable on a classification and regression tree (CART) to identify risk groups for TRDD.  Results:   Overall, 1568 patients were considered. Pooled CI of TRDD was 19% after accounting for competing events (death: 474; progression: 59) within 12 months of starting treatment. To build a risk calculator we relied on a CRR that ultimately included age, ECOG performance status, AST, bilirubin, use of analgesics, and presence of diabetes and chronic kidney disease. The CART analysis identified three risk groups that were named: low (model-derived TRDD risk ≤24%), intermediate (25-64%), and high (≥65%) risk group. In each risk group, probability of TRDD during treatment was 14%, 58%, and 79%, and median OS was 24 months, 20 months, and 13 months, respectively (p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Treatment selection in mCRPC remains a challenge. Our model can help clinicians balance Docetaxel toxicity and efficacy.

However, clinical trials testing autophagy inhibition using chloroquine derivatives in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) have yet to yield promising results, potentially due to the side effects of this class of compounds. We hypothesized that identification of the upstream activators of autophagy in prostate cancer could highlight alternative, context-dependent targets for blocking this important cellular process during disease progression. Here, we used molecular, genetic, and pharmacological approaches to elucidate an AR-mediated autophagy cascade involving Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CAMKK2; a kinase with a restricted expression profile), 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1), but independent of canonical mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity. Increased CAMKK2-AMPK-ULK1 signaling correlated with disease progression in genetic mouse models and patient tumor samples. Importantly, CAMKK2 disruption impaired tumor growth and prolonged survival in multiple CRPC preclinical mouse models. Similarly, an inhibitor of AMPK-ULK1 blocked autophagy, cell growth, and colony formation in prostate cancer cells. Collectively, our findings converge to demonstrate that AR can co-opt the CAMKK2-AMPK-ULK1 signaling cascade to promote prostate cancer by increasing autophagy.

We applied these HOX codes to the transcriptomic profiles of prostate cancer (PCa) samples and found that the majority of prostate adenocarcinoma (AdPCa) samples sustained a prostate-specific HOX code whereas the majority of neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPCa) samples did not, which reflects the anaplastic nature of NEPCa. Also, our analysis showed that the NEPCa samples did not correlate well with the HOX codes of any other tissue types, indicating that NEPCa tumors lose their prostate identities but do not gain new tissue identities. Additionally, using immunohistochemical staining, we evaluated the prostatic expression of HOXB13, the most prominently changed HOX gene in NEPCa. We found that HOXB13 was expressed in both benign prostatic tissues and AdPCa but its expression was reduced or lost in NEPCa. Furthermore, we treated PCa cells with all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and found that the reduced HOXB13 expression can be reverted.

Nano drug delivery enables improved pharmacokinetic profile, bioavailability and therapeutic efficiency compared to the regular chemotherapeutic drugs. Herein, we have established a simple method for the synthesis of docetaxel (Dtx) encapsulated poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for targeted drug delivery to prostate cancer. AuNPs were synthesized by the citrate ion reduction method followed by functionalization with thiol-PEG-amine (SH-PEG-NH2). SH-PEG-NH2 functionalized AuNPs were conjugated with the targeting vehicle, folic acid (FA). The anticancer drug, Dtx was encapsulated within AuNPs by the non-covalent linkage method. The physicochemical characteristics of the synthesized nanoformulations were extensively characterized by various spectral and microscopic studies. HR-TEM indicates the average size of the AuNPs is 16 nm and the nanoformulations is 18 nm. The encapsulation efficiency of the Dtx is ~ 96% which is confirmed by the elemental mapping analysis. The in vitro drug release profile of Dtx and AuNPs nanoformulations were studied by the dialysis membrane method. The anticancer activity of docetaxel encapsulated AuNPs were evaluated with prostate cancer cell lines (PC3). The drug encapsulated nanoformulations reduced the cell viability to about 40% (40 µM concentration at 24, 48 and 72 h of treatment). The optical microscopy observation reveals that the damage of prostate cancer cells after exposure to Dtx encapsulated AuNPs. The good cytotoxic activity of the present nanoformulation against prostate cancer cell lines enables its application for targeted drug delivery to prostate cancer.""","""['S Thambiraj', 'R Vijayalakshmi', 'D Ravi Shankaran']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Evaluation of cytotoxic activity of docetaxel loaded gold nanoparticles for lung cancer drug delivery.', 'Plasmonic photothermal release of docetaxel by gold nanoparticles incorporated onto halloysite nanotubes with conjugated 2D8-E3 antibodies for selective cancer therapy.', 'Synthesis and in vitro studies of gold nanoparticles loaded with docetaxel.', 'Pharmacokinetic Consequences of PLGA Nanoparticles in Docetaxel Drug Delivery.', 'Polymer decorated gold nanoparticles in nanomedicine conjugates.', 'High Biocompatibility, MRI Enhancement, and Dual Chemo- and Thermal-Therapy of Curcumin-Encapsulated Alginate/Fe3O4 Nanoparticles.', 'Current applications of nanomaterials in urinary system tumors.', 'Green Synthesized sAuNPs as a Potential Delivery Platform for Cytotoxic Alkaloids.', 'Metal-Polymer Nanoconjugates Application in Cancer Imaging and Therapy.', 'Inhibition Of Tau Protein Aggregation By a Chaperone-like β-Boswellic Acid Conjugated To Gold Nanoparticles.']"""

In contrast, we show here that mutually exclusive prostate cancer driver alterations involving the ERG transcription factor and the ubiquitin ligase adaptor SPOP are synthetic sick. At the molecular level, the incompatible cancer pathways are driven by opposing functions in SPOP. ERG upregulates wild type SPOP to dampen androgen receptor (AR) signaling and sustain ERG activity through degradation of the bromodomain histone reader ZMYND11. Conversely, SPOP-mutant tumors stabilize ZMYND11 to repress ERG-function and enable oncogenic androgen receptor signaling. This dichotomy regulates the response to therapeutic interventions in the AR pathway. While mutant SPOP renders tumor cells susceptible to androgen deprivation therapies, ERG promotes sensitivity to high-dose androgen therapy and pharmacological inhibition of wild type SPOP.

Here the relative influence on prostate specific antigen screening rates by 2 concurrent and opposing system-level policy initiatives is investigated: improved access to care and change in clinical practice guidelines.  Materials and methods:   Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data from years 2012 to 2018 were analyzed for trends in self-reported prostate specific antigen screening and insurance coverage. Subanalyses included state Medicaid expansion status and respondent federal poverty level. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to evaluate factors associated with prostate specific antigen screening.  Results:   From 2012 to 2018 prostate specific antigen screening predominantly declined with a notable exception of an increase of 7.3% for men at <138% federal poverty level between 2011 and 2013 in early expansion states. Initial increases did not continue, and screening trends mirrored those of nonexpansion states by 2018. Notably, 2014 planned expansions states did not follow this trend with minimal change between 2015 and 2017 compared to declines in early expansion states and nonexpansion states (-0.4% vs -6.7% and -8.6%, respectively).  Conclusions:   Medicaid expansion was associated with increased rates of insured men at <138% federal poverty level from 2012 to 2018 in early expansion states. In this group, initial increases in prostate specific antigen screening were not durable and followed the trend of reduced screening seen across the United States. In planned expansions states the global drop in prostate specific antigen screening from 2016 to 2018 was offset in men at <138% federal poverty level by expanding access to care. Nonexpansion states showed a steady decline in prostate specific antigen screening rates. This suggests that policy such as U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations against screening competes with and often outmatches access to care.""","""['William C Daly', 'Joshua A Linscott', 'Paul K J Han', 'Matthew H Hayn', 'Moritz H Hansen', 'Stephen T Ryan', 'Scot C Remick', 'Jesse D Sammon']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Prostate Cancer Screening in Early Medicaid Expansion States.', 'Changes in prostate-specific antigen at the time of prostate cancer diagnosis after Medicaid expansion in young men.', 'Effect of Medicaid Expansion on Colorectal Cancer Screening Rates.', 'Recent Changes in Prostate Cancer Screening Practices and Epidemiology.', ""Impact of the United States Preventive Services Task Force 'D' recommendation on prostate cancer screening and staging."", ""Medicaid Expansions: Probing Medicaid's Filling of the Cancer Genetic Testing and Screening Space.""]"""

Erythropoietin is a promising neurotrophic factor for neurogenic erectile dysfunction based on preclinical and retrospective data.  Materials and methods:   ERECT (NCT00737893) is a phase 2, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (July 2017-December 2019) evaluating the impact of perioperative erythropoietin on recovery of erectile function and other patient-reported, health-related quality of life outcomes after bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy (3, 6, 9, and 12 months). Erythropoietin (20,000 units) or saline placebo was injected subcutaneously the day before, day of, and day after surgery for 3 total doses.  Results:   Of 63 patients assessed for eligibility, 56 patients were randomized. Arms (29 erythropoietin, 27 placebo) were well balanced (89.3% robotic, median age 55.5 years). International Index of Erectile Function-Erectile Function Domain (IIEF-EF) scores increased from median 12.5 at 3 months to 24.5 at 12 months. Median 2-week serum hemoglobin was higher for the erythropoietin arm compared to placebo (14.7 vs 13.6, p=0.02).

Excellent nerve-sparing rating (10/10) was associated with improved IIEF-EF recovery (+5.2, p=0.022). Other patient-reported, health-related quality of life domains as well as oncologic outcome and complications were similar between arms during followup.

We argued that conducting consent in two stages-splitting information about research procedures from information about the experimental intervention-would reduce the decisional anxiety, confusion, and information overload commonly associated with informed consent. We implemented two-stage consent in a low-stakes randomized trial of a mindfulness meditation intervention for procedural distress in patients undergoing prostate biopsy. Here, we report accrual rates and patient understanding of the consent process.  Methods:   Patients approached for consent for the biopsy trial were asked to complete the standard ""Quality of Informed Consent"" questionnaire to assess their knowledge and understanding of the trial.  Results:   Accrual was excellent with 108 of 110 (98%) patients approached for consent signing first-stage consent. All 51 patients randomized to the experimental arm and who later presented for biopsy signed second-stage consent and received the mindfulness intervention. Quality of Informed Consent data were available for 48 patients assigned to the mindfulness treatment arm and 44 controls. The mean Quality of Informed Consent score was similar in the meditation and control arms with and overall mean of 75 (95% confidence interval = 74-76) for the knowledge section and 86 (95% confidence interval = 81-90) for understanding, comparable to the normative scores of 80 and 88. On further analysis and patient interview, two of the Quality of Informed Consent questions were found to be misleading in the context of a two-stage consent study for a mindfulness intervention. Excluding these questions increased knowledge scores to 88 (95% confidence interval = 87-90).  Conclusion:   We found promising data that two-stage consent facilitated accrual without compromising patient understanding of randomized trials or compliance with allocated treatment.

Methods:   The number of therapy beds available in German nuclear medicine departments was included in a basic calculation in view of the overall potential for therapy beds to be expected in the event of a possible approval of a therapeutic agent for the Lu-177-PSMA-RLT for mCRPC patients. A potential expansion of the Lu-PSMA-therapy indications was not taken into account.  Results:   The basic calculation shows for a nationwide nuclear medicine bed capacity of approx. 234 000 treatment days a relatively small bed reserve of approx. 19 000 nuclear medicine bed days, which corresponds to a reserve of 63 beds for the research question. There are regional differences in bed capacity: while for some federal states there is an under-capacity of nuclear medicine therapy beds with an approved Lu-177-PSMA-RLT, this is less the case for other federal states.  Discussion:   This basic calculation shows that the capacity of nuclear medicine therapy beds is likely to be very well utilized with a prospectively approved therapeutic agent for Lu-177-PSMA-RLT, and could even reach its limits in some German federal states.

Methods:   We used data from the South African HIV Cancer Match Study built on HIV-related laboratory measurements from the National Health Laboratory Services and cancer records from the National Cancer Registry. We evaluated associations between time-updated CD4 cell count and cancer incidence rates using Cox proportional hazards models. We reported adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) over a grid of CD4 values and estimated the aHR per 100 CD4 cells/µL decrease.  Results:   Of 3 532 266 PLWH, 15 078 developed cancer.

Patients are recommended to perform self-care to reduce side effects, but their experiences of performing self-care management after radical prostatectomy are largely unexplored. The aim of this study was to deepen the understanding about patient experiences of support for managing self-care during the first six months after radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   Eighteen patients were consecutively recruited six months after surgery and individual interviews were conducted. The study had a descriptive qualitative approach and inductive content analysis was used.  Results:   Patients described self-care management during the first half-year after surgery as a progression with growth in self-management skills through interconnected phases, from initially striving to get a grasp of the situation and find supportive relationships, to getting grounded in the new situation and taking command of the situation. At six months after surgery, patients had reached a point where they needed to maneuver feelings about long-term consequences.  Conclusions:   Standardized routines ensure a certain level of care, but are sparsely adjustable to patients' progression in self-care management. For sustained self-care behaviors, tailored and interactive support is required from multiple disciplines and peers, in order for a patient to get grounded in and take command of the situation.""","""['Camilla Wennerberg', 'Kristina Schildmeijer', 'Amanda Hellström', 'Mirjam Ekstedt']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur J Oncol Nurs""","""[""Men's experiences following laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a qualitative descriptive study."", 'Long-term quality-of-life outcomes after radical prostatectomy or watchful waiting: the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group-4 randomised trial.', ""Patients' perceptions of radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer: a qualitative study."", 'Functional results and treatment of functional dysfunctions after radical prostatectomy.', 'Understanding urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy: a nursing framework.', 'Role of preoperative patient education among prostate cancer patients treated by radical prostatectomy.']"""

The objective of this study was to assess 68Ga-PSMA-11 uptake in pathological lesions and benign tissue, within 30 minutes after injection in primary prostate cancer (PCa) patients in test-retest setting.  Materials and methods:   Five patients, with biopsy proven PCa, were scanned dynamically in list mode for 30 minutes on a digital PET/CT-scanner directly after an intravenous bolus injection of 100 MBq 68Ga-PSMA-11. Approximately 45 minutes after injection a static whole body scan was acquired, followed by a one bed position scan of the pelvic region. The scans were repeated approximately four weeks later, without any intervention in between. Semi-quantitative assessment was performed using regions-of-interest in the prostate tumor, bladder, gluteal muscle and iliac artery. Time-activity curves were extracted from the counts in these regions and the intra-patient variability between both scans was assessed.  Results:   The uptake of the iliac artery and gluteal muscle reached a plateau after 5 and 3 minutes, respectively. The population fell apart in two groups with respect to tumor uptake: in some patients the tumor uptake reached a plateau after 5 minutes, whereas in other patients the uptake kept increasing, which correlated with larger tumor volumes on PET/CT scan. Median intra-patient variation between both scans was 12.2% for artery, 9.7% for tumor, 32.7% for the bladder and 14.1% for the gluteal muscle.  Conclusion:   Dynamic 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scans, with a time interval of four weeks, are reproducible with a 10% variation in uptake in the primary prostate tumor. An uptake plateau was reached for the iliac artery and gluteal muscle within 5 minutes post-injection. A larger tumor volume seems to be related to continued tumor uptake.

Purpose To explore safety and early oncologic and functional outcomes of targeted focal high-intensity focused ultrasound performed under MRI-guided focused ultrasound for intermediate-risk clinically significant prostate cancer. Materials and Methods In this prospective phase II trial, between February 2016 and July 2019, men with unifocal clinically significant prostate cancer visible at MRI were treated with transrectal MRI-guided focused ultrasound. The primary end point was the 5-month biopsy (last recorded in December 2019) with continuation to the 24-month follow-up projected to December 2021. Real-time ablation monitoring was performed with MR thermography. Nonperfused volume was measured at treatment completion. Periprocedural complications were recorded. Follow-up included International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and International Index of Erectile Function-15 (IIEF-15) score at 6 weeks and 5 months, and multiparametric MRI and targeted biopsy of the treated area at 5 months. The generalized estimating equation model was used for statistical analysis, and the Holm method was used to adjust P value. Results Treatment was successfully completed in all 44 men, 36 with grade group (GG) 2 and eight with GG 3 disease (median age, 67 years; interquartile range [IQR], 62-70 years). No major treatment-related adverse events occurred. Forty-one of 44 participants (93%; 95% CI: 82, 98) were free of clinically significant prostate cancer (≥6 mm GG 1 disease or any volume ≥GG 2 disease) at the treatment site at 5-month biopsy (median, seven cores). Median IIEF-15 and IPSS scores were similar at baseline and at 5 months (IIEF-15 score at baseline, 61 [IQR, 34-67] and at 5 months, 53 [IQR, 24-65.5], P = .18; IPSS score at baseline, 3.5 [IQR, 1.8-7] and at 5 months, 6 [IQR, 2-7.3], P = .43). Larger ablations (≥15 cm3) compared with smaller ones were associated with a decline in IIEF-15 scores at 6 weeks (adjusted P < .01) and at 5 months (adjusted P = .07).

Objectives:   To understand what factors influence peoples' satisfaction with care and how interpersonal trust is established between doctors and cancer patients in Germany.  Design:   A narrative interview study that included women with a diagnosis of breast cancer and men with a diagnosis of prostate cancer. A question-focused analysis was conducted.  Setting and participants:   Interviewees were sought across Germany through self-help organizations, clinics, rehabilitation facilities, physicians and other health-care professionals, in order to develop modules on experiencing cancer for the website krankheitserfahrungen.de (illness experiences.de).  Results:   Satisfaction was related to the perception of having a knowledgeable and trusted physician. Trust was developed through particular interactions in which 'medical expertise' and 'humaneness' were enacted by physicians. Humaneness represents the ability of physicians to personalize medical expertise and thereby to convey working in the individual's best interest and to treat the patient as an individual and unique human being. This was fostered through contextual and relational factors including among others setting, time, information transfer, respect, availability, profoundness, sensitivity and understanding.  Conclusion:   It was the ability to make oneself known to and know the patient in particular ways that allowed for satisfying care experiences by establishing interpersonal trust. This suggests the importance of conceptualizing the doctor-patient relationship as a fundamentally reciprocal human interaction of caregiving and care-receiving. At the core of the satisfying care experiences lies a doctor-patient relationship with a profoundly humane quality.""","""['Susanne Blödt', 'Jacqueline Müller-Nordhorn', 'Georg Seifert', 'Christine Holmberg']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Health Expect""","""[""Understanding the role of health information in patients' experiences: secondary analysis of qualitative narrative interviews with people diagnosed with cancer in Germany."", 'Promoting and supporting self-management for adults living in the community with physical chronic illness: A systematic review of the effectiveness and meaningfulness of the patient-practitioner encounter.', 'What is clinician presence?

However, few studies have reported other imaging methods for BCR with negative 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT findings. We investigated the value of 18F-FDG compared with 68Ga-PSMA and identified BCR patients with 68Ga-PSMA-negative findings who are most likely to benefit from 18F-FDG PET/CT.  Methods:   Seventy-two BCR patients with negative 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT findings were retrospectively identified from 510 patients who underwent concomitant 68Ga-PSMA and 18F-FDG PET/CT between June 2018 and August 2020. Patients were categorised into groups with positive or negative 18F-FDG PET/CT findings. Differences in patients' characteristics between these two groups and predictors of positive 18F-FDG findings were analysed.  Results:   The detection rate of 18F-FDG PET/CT was 16.7% (12/72) in BCR patients with 68Ga-PSMA-negative findings. PSA and Gleason score were significantly higher in the 18F-FDG-positive group than in the 18F-FDG-negative group (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). A multivariate analysis indicated that PSA (PSA ≥2.3 ng/mL) and Gleason score (Gleason score ≥ 8) correlated with 18F-FDG-positive findings (P < 0.001 and P = 0.015, respectively). The probabilities of 18F-FDG-positive findings in the low-potential (PSA <2.3 ng/mL and Gleason score <8), moderate-potential (PSA <2.3 ng/mL and Gleason score ≥ 8 or PSA ≥2.3 ng/mL and Gleason score <8), and high-potential (PSA ≥2.3 ng/mL and Gleason score ≥ 8) groups were 0%, 11.5%, and 90.0%, respectively (P < 0.001).

Previous studies have demonstrated that serotonin regulates cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro; the presence of 5-HT receptors in cancer cells; and the role of serotonin in tumor development. The most recently discovered of these receptors is 5-HT7 but also least characterized receptors of serotonin. The aim of this study is to investigate the existence and possible role of 5-HT7 receptors in healthy and cancerous prostate tissues and also investigate effects of receptor agonists and antagonists on PC-3 cells to evaluate potential therapeutic effects. PC-3 cells were cultured and effects of 5-HT7 receptor agonist (LP-44) and antagonist (SB-269970) were evaluated on these cells. After proliferation analyses, relative expression of apoptotic markers and 5-HT7 receptor mRNA expression levels were determined through real-time PCR. Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining and Hoechst 33258 staining assay methods were applied to determine apoptosis. Additional PCR studies were performed on healthy and cancerous prostate tissue to see existence of receptors in human samples. The viability of PC-3 cells was decreased by SB-269970 after 48 and 72 h of incubation. However, LP-44 increased PC-3 cell proliferation at all time points. In 10-6 M SB-269970 treated PC-3 cells, there was significant increase in the expression of CAS-3 (4-fold), CAS-9 (2.5-fold), BAX (1.9-fold), and Tp-53 (4.8-fold) gene mRNA levels when compared to non-treated control group. Conversely, there was a significant decrease in NF-κB (2.9-fold) and 5-HT7 receptor (3.6-fold) mRNA expression in cells treated with SB-269970 when compared to control. SB-269970 that antagonized 5-HT7 receptors also induced apoptosis in Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining assay and Hoechst 33258 staining assays when compared with other groups. In human samples, 5-HT7 receptor mRNA expression was approximately 200-fold higher than that of heathy ones. In this study, for the first time, the 5-HT7 receptor antagonist SB-269970 has been shown to inhibit proliferation in PC-3 cells and to be associated with an apoptosis-inducing effect.

We aimed to evaluate a novel, one-step method, permitting simultaneous stent removal and guidewire passage using a self-constructed suture snare via standard cystoscopy. This method should be used prior to ureteroscopy, in cases of minimal stent encrustation and peri-ureteral mucosal oedema, where identification and subsequent cannulation of the ureteral orifice may be a challenge.  Methods:   A self-constructed suture snare is constructed using an open-ended ureteral catheter to facilitate this novel 'Switch' technique. Operative duration, cost feasibility and potential complications with this novel method were assessed in patients with an indwelling stent duration above 100 days.  Results:   Age inclusion in this study ranged from 21 to 35 years, with kidney, ureter and bladder scores below 6, in the five patients assessed. Previous ureteral stent indwelling time ranged from 106 to 315 days. Reasons for (pre-stented) ureteroscopy were mostly stone related. The overall recorded procedure time for the Switch technique was successfully performed in less than 96 s (range 68-95 s) in all cases within this series. No procedure-related complications were reported.  Conclusion:   Utilizing the suture snare, the novel Switch technique was successfully performed in all cases assessed.

Lycium ruthenicum Murray is rich in anthocyanins and exhibits many biological activities. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects and possible biological mechanism of the main anthocyanin monomer (Pt3G) of Lycium ruthenicum Murray on prostate cancer DU-145 cells. The cell proliferation was detected by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay. The cell apoptosis rates were assessed by flow cytometric analysis and TUNEL assay. The expressions of apoptosis related proteins were evaluated by western blotting. Our data demonstrated that Pt3G inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis and promoted cell cycle arrest at the S phase in a concentration-dependent manner (0, 100, 200 and 400 μg mL-1). Furthermore, it was shown that Pt3G decreased the mitochondrial membrane permeability through regulating the expressions of Bax and Bcl-2. Western blot analysis indicated that Pt3G significantly increased the expression of PTEN and then activated the PI3K/Akt-mediated caspase 3 pathway. In addition, our results also suggested that Pt3G activated the PTEN gene to induce the apoptosis of DU-145 cells by stimulating the overproduction of ROS. To sum up, these results indicate that Pt3G inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis through the ROS/PTEN/PI3K/Akt/caspase 3 signaling pathway in prostate cancer DU-145 cells.

The expression of TOP2A mRNA was also significantly higher in metastatic than localised PCa with the SMD being 1.72 and the AUC of sROC being 0.91. In summary, miRNA-145-5p may participate in PCa metastasis by binding TOP2A and be useful as a biomarker for the detection of metastatic PCa.""","""['Zhi-Guang Huang', 'Yu Sun', 'Gang Chen', 'Yi-Wu Dang', 'Hui-Ping Lu', 'Juan He', 'Ji-Wen Cheng', 'Mao-Lin He', 'Sheng-Hua Li']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""IET Syst Biol""","""['Downregulation of miRNA-205 Expression and Biological Mechanism in Prostate Cancer Tumorigenesis and Bone Metastasis.', 'Micro-RNA-186-5p inhibition attenuates proliferation, anchorage independent growth and invasion in metastatic prostate cancer cells.', 'Identification of reciprocal microRNA-mRNA pairs associated with metastatic potential disparities in human prostate cancer cells and signaling pathway analysis.', 'Meta-analysis of miRNA expression profiles for prostate cancer recurrence following radical prostatectomy.', 'Decreased miR-218-5p Levels as a Serum Biomarker in Bone Metastasis of Prostate Cancer.', 'Exosomal miRNAs-a diagnostic biomarker acting as a guiding light in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic utility of microRNA-145 and CD 133 in oral squamous cell carcinoma: A pilot study from Northern India.', 'Identification of MicroRNAs as Viable Aggressiveness Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   The study adopted a descriptive cross-sectional design. To investigate the behavioral and social factors associated with men's screening behavior in rural communities, the study utilized an interviewer-administered questionnaire. A sample of 384 men who lived in six rural communities across Southwest Nigeria participated in the study. Constructs of the Health Belief Model provided theoretical framing. Key variables were the demographics, screening behavior, knowledge of PCa, and perception of PCa risk. Data analysis tools were descriptive (simple percentages) and multiple regression at p < 0.05.  Results:   About 49.7% were age 31-40, most of the men in the rural communities (64.1%) did not have more than secondary school education, and about 48.7% owned their businesses. Exactly 56% earned less than 18,000 per month; 65.6% were Christians, and the majority (90.6%) were married, with most (60.2%) not having more than four children (≤4 children). Knowledge of PCa has a significant but weak relationship with PCa screening behavior (p = 0.02). Age (β = 0.014), religion (β = 0.052), and income (β = 0.010)/(β = 0.011) had predicted risk perception. Only income (β = 0.038) significantly influenced screening behavior.  Conclusion:   There is a need to improve PCa awareness and knowledge to address risk perception fears and encourage increased screening behavior among men in rural areas.""","""['Isaac A Adedeji', 'Saheed A Lawal', 'Sola Aluko-Arowolo', 'Ebun O Oduwole']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Psychooncology""","""['Prostate cancer knowledge gaps among community stakeholders in rural Nigeria: implications for seeking screening.', 'Awareness and Attitudes of Nigerian Men Living in Abuja on Prostate Cancer and Screening.', 'Knowledge, attitudes and screening practices regarding prostatic diseases among men older than 40 years: a population-based study in Southwest Nigeria.', 'Prostate cancer screening: what do men know, think and do about their risk? exploring the opinions of men in an urban area in Lagos State, Nigeria: a mixed methods survey.', 'Prostate cancer awareness and screening practice among Kenyan men.', 'Risk perception of non-communicable diseases: A systematic review on its assessment and associated factors.', 'Willingness-to-pay for a population-based-prostate-specific antigen screening for prostate cancer in Anambra State, Southeast, Nigeria: a contingent valuation study.', 'Prostate cancer knowledge gaps among community stakeholders in rural Nigeria: implications for seeking screening.']"""

PBX3 is involved in the progression of gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, and prostate cancer; however, the detailed mechanism by which it promotes tumor growth remains to be elucidated. Here, we found that PBX3 silencing induces the expression of the cell cycle regulator p21, leading to an increase in colorectal cancer (CRC) cell apoptosis as well as suppression of proliferation and colony formation. Furthermore, we found that PBX3 is highly expressed in clinical CRC patients, in whom p21 expression is aberrantly low. We found that the regulation of p21 transcription by PBX3 occurs through the upstream regulator of p21, the tumor suppressor p53, as PBX3 binds to the p53 promoter and suppresses its transcriptional activity. Finally, we revealed that PBX3 regulates tumor growth through regulation of the p53/p21 axis.

However, chronic exposure to MSCs drives the selection of prostate cancer cells that are resistant to IL-28-induced apoptosis and therapeutics such as docetaxel. Further, MSC-selected/IL-28-resistant prostate cancer cells grow at accelerated rates in bone. Acquired resistance to apoptosis is PCa cell intrinsic, and is associated with a shift in IL-28Rα signaling via STAT1 to STAT3.

We explored how prostate CTCs can resist cell death in response to forces of this magnitude. The DU145, PC3 and LNCaP human prostate cancer cell lines were used to represent cells of different metastatic origins. The cell lines were briefly treated with an average FSS of 3950 dyn/cm2 (395 Pa) using a 30 G needle and a syringe pump. DU145 cells had no change in cell viability, PC3 cells had some cell death and LNCaP cells exhibited significant cell death. These cell death responses correlated with increased cell membrane damage, less efficient membrane repair and increased stiffness.

Simultaneously, prostate-specific antigen testing has become less popular in the last few years, which has resulted in higher cancer grade and stage at diagnosis. We evaluated stage and grade migration in the disease of patients treated with RP in a large German cohort.  Patients and methods:   Overall, 4842 patients undergoing RP between 2000 and 2019 were included. Age, prostate-specific antigen level, biopsy, and pathologic Gleason score as well as clinical and pathologic stage were collected. D'Amico risk groups and Gleason score were evaluated over different time points.  Results:   We detected a significant grade migration toward higher grade. The proportion of biopsy Gleason sum ≤ 6 dropped from 45.8% to 20.6% between ≤ 2010 and 2017-2019. Further, the proportion of patients with low D'Amico risk scores also decreased by almost 50% (20.8% vs 12.2%). Finally, the proportion of non-organ-confined PCa increased over time, and the proportion of postoperative Gleason sum ≤ 6 decreased from 20% to 10% over time.  Conclusion:   Taken together, data indicate a significant preoperative grade and stage migration toward disease of higher grade in RP-treated PCa. Between the years 2000 and 2019, the proportion of biopsy Gleason sum ≤ 6 and the proportions of D'Amico low risk disease decreased by approximately 50% (respectively, 45% to 20% and 20.8% to 12.2%).

Methods and materials:   In this trial, patients with PCa with Gleason score ≤7, clinical stage T1b to T3a, and prostate-specific antigen level <30 ng/mL were randomly assigned to neoadjuvant and concurrent ADT for 6 months, starting 4 months before or concurrent with prostate radiation therapy, or concurrent and adjuvant ADT for 6 months, starting simultaneously with prostate radiation therapy. HR-QoL was assessed using European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL questionnaires. Time until definitive deterioration was defined as time from random allocation to the first deterioration of at least 10 points with no further improvement of ≥10 points or if the patient experienced progression, died, or dropped out after deterioration, resulting in missing data. Stratified log-rank tests were applied for between-group comparisons of time-to-event estimates.  Results:   Overall, 393 patients (194 and 199 in the 2 arms, respectively) were evaluable, except 214 (101 and 113 in the 2 arms, respectively) for sexual function. Five-year rates of freedom from definitive deterioration of urinary symptoms, bowel symptoms, and sexual activity were 33.5%, 33.1%, and 38.5% in the neoadjuvant group and 34.1%, 35.4%, and 36.7% in the adjuvant group, respectively, with no significant between-group differences. The adjuvant approach was associated with a reduced risk of definitive deterioration of sexual function (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.49-0.94; P = .02). With respect to clinical relevance, the mean change in score for sexual function showed only a small to moderate difference favoring the adjuvant group at and beyond 3 years.

A study of the influence of individual and analytical factors on decision making for biopsy referral""","""Background and aims:   We investigated factors influencing pre-biopsy prostate-specific antigen (PSA) retesting as recommended by clinical guidelines.  Materials and methods:   333 patients screened for prostate cancer (PCa) repeated PSA (Roche Cobas systems) after a median of 3.9 months, before performing biopsy. Multiple regression models were used to assess effects of patients' characteristics on PSA results and changes over time.  Results:   PCa [n = 132 (40.7%)] and cancer-free [n = 192 (59.3%)] patients had similar rate of PSA positive results at baseline (84.8% vs. 83.9%, P = 0.931). Their rate of reversion to normal PSA after retesting was negligible (0.9% in PCa and 3.7% in PCa-free patients, P = 0.286). 31.1% of PCa and 31.3% of cancer-free patients (P = 0.426) showed a significant PSA increase after retesting. Age was a confounder since not only PSA increased in older PCa patients, but it was also related to PCa histological grade, in turn associated to PSA increase. In PCa-free patients, glandular inflammation, present in 1/3 of subjects, was also associated to higher PSA concentrations.  Conclusion:   When obtained with the same immunoassay under controlled analytical conditions, a PSA positive result is confirmed after retesting in the great majority of screened patients.

Methods:   Patients with breast or prostate cancer who had recently finished chemotherapy at 2 academic medical centers were surveyed by telephone. Interviewers inquired about all medications, including HS, before, during, and after chemotherapy. Micromedex, Lexicomp, and Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database interaction software programs were used to determine PMIs.  Results:   A total of 67 subjects (age range, 39-77 years) were evaluated in this study. Participants were primarily White patients (73%) with breast cancer (87%). The median number of medications was 11 (range, 2-28) during the entire study and was highest during chemotherapy (7; range, 2-22). Approximately four-fifths (84%) used HS. A total of 1747 PMIs were identified, and they represented 635 unique PMIs across all 3 timeframes, with most occurring during chemotherapy. Prescription-related PMIs (70%) were the most common type, and they were followed by HS-related (56%) and anticancer treatment-related PMIs (22%). Approximately half of the PMIs (54%) were categorized as moderate interactions, and more than one-third (38%) were categorized as major interactions. Patient use of HS increased from 51% during chemotherapy to 66% after chemotherapy, and this correlated with an increased prevalence of HS PMIs (46% to 60%). HS users were more likely to be at risk for a major PMI than non-HS users (92% vs 70%; P = .038).  Conclusions:   The use of HS remains prevalent among patients with cancer and may place them at risk for PMIs both during chemotherapy and after the completion of treatment.  Lay summary:   This study evaluates the risk of potential medication interactions for patients with breast or prostate cancer undergoing chemotherapy. The results show that patients often use herbs and supplements during treatment. Prescription medications are most often associated with medication interactions, which are followed by herb and supplement-related interactions. More than one-third of potential medication interactions are considered major.

In simulated mixtures, four public cell line mixtures, and a targeted panel (1199 samples; 406 genes) from the Carolina Breast Cancer Study, DeCompress recapitulates cell-type proportions with less error than reference-free methods and finds biologically relevant compartments. We integrate compartment estimates into cis-eQTL mapping in breast cancer, identifying a tumor-specific cis-eQTL for CCR3 (C-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 3) at a risk locus.

Fully automated treatment planning processes could reduce a planner's active treatment planning time and remove inter-planner variability, with the potential to tremendously improve patient turnover and quality of care. In developing fully automated algorithms for treatment planning, we have two main objectives: to produce plans that are 1) Pareto optimal and 2) clinically acceptable. Here, we propose the Pareto optimal projection search (POPS) algorithm, which provides a general framework for directly searching the Pareto front.  Methods:   Our POPS algorithm is a novel automated planning method that combines two main search processes: 1) gradient-free search in the decision variable space and 2) projection of decision variables to the Pareto front using the bisection method. We demonstrate the performance of POPS by comparing with clinical treatment plans. As one possible quantitative measure of treatment plan quality, we construct a clinical acceptability scoring function (SF) modified from the previously developed general evaluation metric (GEM).  Results:   On a dataset of 21 prostate cases collected as part of clinical workflow, our proposed POPS algorithm produces Pareto optimal plans that are clinically acceptable in regards to dose conformity, dose homogeneity, and sparing of organs-at-risk.  Conclusion:   Our proposed POPS algorithm provides a general framework for fully automated treatment planning that achieves clinically acceptable dosimetric quality without requiring active planning from human planners.

Drugs acting on the orthosteric hormone binding site suffer from resistance mechanisms that can, in the worst case, reverse their therapeutic effect. While many allosteric ligands targeting either the activation function-2 (AF-2) or the binding function-3 (BF-3) have been reported, their potential for simultaneous administration with currently prescribed antiandrogens was disregarded. Here, we report results of 60 μs molecular dynamics simulations to investigate combinations of orthosteric and allosteric AR antagonists. Our results suggest BF-3 inhibitors to be more suitable in combination with classical antiandrogens as opposed to AF-2 inhibitors based on binding free energies and binding modes. As a mechanistic explanation for these observations, we deduced a structural adaptation of helix-12 involved in the formation of the AF-2 site by classical AR antagonists. Additionally, the changes were accompanied by an expansion of the orthosteric binding site.

Methods:   Forty-eight PCa patients of GS 3 + 4 and 37 patients of GS 4 + 3 are retrieved and randomly divided into training (60%) and testing (40%) sets. Axial image showing the maximum tumor size is selected in the T2WI and ADC maps for further image texture feature analysis. Three hundred texture features are computed from each region of interest (ROI) using MaZda software. Feature reduction is implemented to obtain 30 optimal features, which are then used to generate the most discriminative features (MDF).

Unfortunately, effective treatment for patients with advanced prostate cancer is still lacking. Verbascoside, a phenylethanoid glycoside, displays various pharmacological properties, such as the anti-cancer activities. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of purified verbascoside on human prostate cancer and the associated molecular mechanisms.  Materials and methods:   The human prostate cancer cell lines, Du-145 and PC-3, were treated with various concentrations of verbascoside (0.1, 1, 10 μM) for 24 h followed by the examination of cell viability using MTT and trypan blue exclusion assays. Cell migration and invasion capacities were assessed by wound healing assay and transwell system. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining were used to detect the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated factors, components of transforming growth factor (TGF-β)/Smad signaling, and high-mobility group box (HMGB)/receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) axis.  Results:   Verbascoside treatment significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities of Du-145 and PC-3 cells. We showed that verbascoside decreased the expression of EMT promotors, Snail and Slug, and increased the expression of E-cadherin. Moreover, the expression level of alpha-smooth muscle actin was downregulated by verbascoside as well. Besides, we found that the TGF-β pathway was suppressed, which was demonstrated by the diminished expression of type I and II TGF-β receptors and phosphorylated Smad2/3 along with the upregulated Smad7. Our data suggested that this downregulation of TGF-β signaling was mediated by repression of HMGB 1 (HMGB1)/RAGE axis.  Conclusion:   Verbascoside mitigated the cell proliferation and aggressiveness of prostate cancer via downregulation of TGF-β-associated EMT progression through HMGB1/RAGE suppression. Collectively, our findings revealed that verbascoside may be a beneficial dietary supplement for prostate cancer patients.""","""['Chun-Hsien Wu', 'Chung-Hsien Chen', 'Pei-Fang Hsieh', 'Yen-Hsi Lee', 'Wade Wei-Ting Kuo', 'Richard Chen-Yu Wu', 'Chih-Hsin Hung', 'Yu-Lin Yang', 'Victor C Lin']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Environ Toxicol""","""['HMGB1 attenuates TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition of FaDu hypopharyngeal carcinoma cells through regulation of RAGE expression.', 'HMGB1 Enhances the AGE-Induced Expression of CTGF and TGF-β via RAGE-Dependent Signaling in Renal Tubular Epithelial Cells.', 'The Regulatory Role of Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1 in Bladder Cancer Cells.', 'Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) in prostate cancer: A dual function mediator?', 'Alterations in TGFβ signaling during prostate cancer progression.', 'Bioactive Compounds of Verbascum sinuatum L.: Health Benefits and Potential as New Ingredients for Industrial Applications.', 'Phenylethanoid Glycoside-Enriched Extract Prepared from Clerodendrum chinense Leaf Inhibits A549 Lung Cancer Cell Migration and Apoptosis Induction through Enhancing ROS Production.', 'The Promising Therapeutic Approaches for Radiation-Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis: Targeting Radiation-Induced Mesenchymal Transition of Alveolar Type II Epithelial Cells.', 'The Anti-Tumor Efficacy of Verbascoside on Ovarian Cancer via Facilitating CCN1-AKT/NF-κB Pathway-Mediated M1 Macrophage Polarization.', 'The pharmacokinetic property and pharmacological activity of acteoside: A review.']"""

Using a linear-quadratic model, normalized total doses (NTDs) of points where deposited dose was reduced from the prescribed dose by dosimetric perturbation of a fiducial marker were calculated in two hypothetical prostate cancer treatment schedules: a) irradiation of both parallel-opposed lateral fields and b) irradiation of alternate field in each daily treatment. The impact of hypofractionation and sublethal damage repair between irradiation on NTD was also estimated. The NTD of two fields/day schedule becomes lower than that of one field/day schedule. The difference becomes larger as dose reduction from one of two fields becomes more enhanced. The NTD reduction from the total dose in the two fields/day schedule is largest (30% of total dose) where the dose from one beam is completely lost by a fiducial marker. In contrast, the NTD reduction from the total dose in the one field/day schedule is largest (9% of total dose) where the half dose from one beam is decreased by a fiducial marker. In addition, the NTD reduction becomes larger as the fractional dose increases in a hypofractionated regimen, and when the effect of sublethal damage repair was incorporated. These influences become significant in prostate cancer since the radiobiological sensitivity α/β of prostate cancer is lower than other cancer types and normal tissues late complication. Treating with one alternate field in a daily treatment can improve a deteriorating treatment effect by dosimetric distortion of a fiducial marker in prostate cancer treatment. However, the choice of the number of beams in a fraction must also be determined by considering the sparing of normal tissues and patient-specific status.""","""['Tatstuhiko Sagara', 'Takahiro Kato', 'Masao Murakami']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Biomed Phys Eng Express""","""['Dosimetric adaptive IMRT driven by fiducial points.', 'Biological effect of dose distortion by fiducial markers in spot-scanning proton therapy with a limited number of fields: a simulation study.', 'Investigation of the dosimetric impact of a Ni-Ti fiducial marker in carbon ion and proton beams.', 'Dosimetric and radiobiological impact of intensity modulated proton therapy and RapidArc planning for high-risk prostate cancer with seminal vesicles.', 'Maximizing the biological effect of proton dose delivered with scanned beams via inhomogeneous daily dose distributions.']"""

In this pandemic context, cancer patients constitute a particularly fragile population that would benefit the best from such treatments, a present unmet need. TMPRSS2 is essential for COVID-19 replication cycle and it is under androgen control. Estrogen and androgen receptor dependent cues converge on TMPRSS2 regulation through different mechanisms of action that can be blocked by the use of hormonal therapies. We believe that there is enough body of evidence to foresee a prophylactic use of hormonal therapies against COVID-19 and this hypothesis can be easily tested on cohorts of breast and prostate cancer patients who follow those regimens. In case of pandemic, if the protective effect of hormonal therapies will be proven on cancer patients, the use of specific hormonal therapies could be extended to other oncological groups and to healthy individuals to decrease the overall risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2.   Given the COVID-19 coronavirus emergency, a special focus is needed on the impact of this rapidly spreading viral infection on cancer patients. Androgen receptor (AR) signaling in the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) regulation is emerging as an important determinant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) susceptibility. In our study, we analyzed AR and TMPRSS2 expression in 17,352 normal and 9,556 cancer tissues from public repositories and stratified data according to sex and age.

In the contexts of breast, cervical, and prostate cancer screening, this research utilized recently collected Health Information National Trends Survey data (HINTS 5 Cycle 1) to examine whether, among the population at risk of cancer, previous cancer information seeking influenced cancer screening via perceptions of risk and efficacy, desired uncertainty, and worry. The results indicated that previous cancer information seeking had a direct effect on cancer screening. Across the three cancer screening behaviors, desired uncertainty mediated the relationship between previous cancer information seeking and screening behavior. Worry about getting cancer moderated and mediated the relationship between cancer information seeking and cervical cancer screening. Moreover, desired uncertainty and perceived susceptibility respectively interacted with previous cancer information seeking to influence breast cancer screening. Perceptions of risk and efficacy had limited effects on cancer screening.

Results:   A total of 1343 patients were analyzed. Mean age was 64.0 years. Mean weight was 82.2 kg and mean BMI was 26.8 kg/m2. Mean PSA concentration was 8.7 ng/mL and mean PSA mass 29.3 ng. On univariate analysis, an association was found between PSA mass and either BMI, weight and waist circumference. No association was found between PSA concentration and each weight parameters. On multivariate analysis, obesity was not an independent predictor of PSA concentration (p = 0.73). Independent predictors of PSA concentration were cardiovascular disease (negative association, p = 0.034), predominant Gleason 4 (positive association, p < 0.001) and pT3a (positive association, p < 0.001).

As demographic changes will lead to a substantial rise of geriatric patients in need of health care services and as little is known on the outcome of these patients, we retrospectively analyzed a consecutive series of nonagenarians admitted to our urological ward.  Materials and methods:   In a retrospective study we analyzed all nonagenarians admitted to our urological ward between 2014 and 2018. Patients were followed for 12 months and predictors for mortality were calculated.  Results:   A total of 152 patients with a mean age of 92 years entered this study. The most frequent indications for admission were macrohematuria, bladder dysfunction, urinary tract infection, hydronephrosis and urinary retention. A history of bladder cancer was present in 18% and of renal cell cancer in 5% of patients. Prostate cancer was present in 21%. The most frequent invasive interventions were the insertion of an irrigation catheter, cystoscopy, bladder tumor resection and insertion of a DJ-catheter. The mean length of hospitalization was 6.5 days. In-house mortality was 9% and the 12 months mortality rate 45%. The strongest predictor for a 12 months mortality was the CSHA-Frailty Scale.  Conclusion:   Urogerontology is one of the biggest challenges in our field. The cohort of nonagenarians studied herein demonstrates a high rate of invasive interventions, an acceptable length of hospitalization and an in-house mortality in the range of 9%.

Although clinical strategies are accumulated for PCa prevention, there is still a lack of sensitive biomarkers for the holistic management in PCa occurrence and progression. Based on systems biology and artificial intelligence, translational informatics provides new perspectives for PCa biomarker prioritization and carcinogenic survey. Methods: In this study, gene expression and miRNA-mRNA association data were integrated to construct conditional networks specific to PCa occurrence and progression, respectively. Based on network modeling, hub miRNAs with significantly strong single-line regulatory power were topologically identified and those shared by the condition-specific network systems were chosen as candidate biomarkers for computational validation and functional enrichment analysis. Results: Nine miRNAs, i.e., hsa-miR-1-3p, hsa-miR-125b-5p, hsa-miR-145-5p, hsa-miR-182-5p, hsa-miR-198, hsa-miR-22-3p, hsa-miR-24-3p, hsa-miR-34a-5p, and hsa-miR-499a-5p, were prioritized as key players for PCa management. Most of these miRNAs achieved high AUC values (AUC > 0.70) in differentiating different prostate samples. Among them, seven of the miRNAs have been previously reported as PCa biomarkers, which indicated the performance of the proposed model. The remaining hsa-miR-22-3p and hsa-miR-499a-5p could serve as novel candidates for PCa predicting and monitoring. In particular, key miRNA-mRNA regulations were extracted for pathogenetic understanding. Here hsa-miR-145-5p was selected as the case and hsa-miR-145-5p/NDRG2/AR and hsa-miR-145-5p/KLF5/AR axis were found to be putative mechanisms during PCa evolution. In addition, Wnt signaling, prostate cancer, microRNAs in cancer etc. were significantly enriched by the identified miRNAs-mRNAs, demonstrating the functional role of the identified miRNAs in PCa genesis. Conclusion: Biomarker miRNAs together with the associated miRNA-mRNA relations were computationally identified and analyzed for PCa management and carcinogenic deciphering. Further experimental and clinical validations using low-throughput techniques and human samples are expected for future translational studies.""","""['Yuxin Lin', 'Zhijun Miao', 'Xuefeng Zhang', 'Xuedong Wei', 'Jianquan Hou', 'Yuhua Huang', 'Bairong Shen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Front Genet""","""['Multivariate competing endogenous RNA network characterization for cancer microRNA biomarker discovery: a novel bioinformatics model with application to prostate cancer metastasis.', 'microRNA Expression Profiling in Young Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Identification of Hub Genes Associated with Hypertension and Their Interaction with miRNA Based on Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) Analysis.', 'MicroRNAs in oral fluids (saliva and gingival crevicular fluid) as biomarkers in orthodontics: systematic review and integrated bioinformatic analysis.', 'Role of Metastasis-Related microRNAs in Prostate Cancer Progression and Treatment.', 'An Immunocompetent Environment Unravels the Proto-Oncogenic Role of miR-22.', 'The cuproptosis related genes signature predicts the prognosis and correlates with the immune status of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'Loss of miR-936 leads to acquisition of androgen-independent metastatic phenotype in prostate cancer.', ""Hsa_circRNA_0040462: a sensor of cells' response to CAP treatment with double-edged roles on breast cancer malignancy."", 'Cancer Detection Using an Artificial Secretable MicroRNA Found in Blood and Urine.']"""

However, the safety of these recommendations is largely based on nonurological surgical experiences.  Objective:   To verify the safety of these recommendations in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP).  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 5317 patients underwent RP in our tertiary care centre between December 2017 and February 2020. Of them, 107 consecutive patients had DOACs in standard preoperative medication. DOAC intake was stopped 2-3 d before RP. Postoperatively, patients received weight- and risk-adapted low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). DOAC intake was restarted, and administration of LMWH was stopped the 3rd day after surgery. For comparison, we performed 1:2 propensity-score matching (DOAC:non-DOAC), which resulted in 321 consecutive patients.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Perioperative outcomes and 30-d morbidity were compared between both cohorts. The Wilcoxon rank sum test and the Pearson's chi-square test were used.  Results and limitations:   The median age of patients with DOACs was 68 yr. Sixty-six patients (61.7%) stopped DOAC intake 48 h and 41 patients (38.3%) 72 h before RP. In comparison with the matching cohort, the median blood loss during RP, median duration of surgery, and median duration of hospitalisation did not differ in a statistically significant fashion. Similarly, there was no significant difference in 30-d morbidity between groups. Importantly, the rate of bleeding and thromboembolic complications did likewise not differ significantly, though it is a nonrandomised and retrospective study.  Conclusions:   Standardised perioperative management of DOACs is important to minimise bleeding and thromboembolic complications. RP can be performed with a low perioperative complication risk if patients are adherent to our presented algorithm.  Patient summary:   We looked at peri- and postoperative complications and compared direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) and non-DOAC patients. We found no significant difference in thromboembolic and bleeding complications between the groups.

However, DCPC's cost-effectiveness in the United States is unknown, particularly for patients with prostate cancer in the United States. This study evaluates the health and economic impact of providing DCPC to patients with prostate cancer.  Methods:   DCPC was compared with usual care in a mathematical model that simulates depression and its outcomes in a hypothetical cohort of US patients with prostate cancer. DCPC was modeled as a sequential combination of universal depression screening, post-screening evaluations, and first-line combination therapy. Primary outcomes were lifetime direct costs of depression care, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Secondary outcomes included life expectancy, number of depression-free months and lifetime depressive episodes, duration of depressive episodes, cumulative incidence of depression, lifetime depression diagnoses/misdiagnoses, and the cumulative incidence of maintenance therapy for depression. Sensitivity analyses were used to examine uncertainty.  Results:   In the base case, DCPC dominated usual care by offering 0.11 more QALYs for $2500 less per patient (from averted misdiagnoses). DCPC also offered 5 extra depression-free months, shorter depressive episodes, and a lower chance of maintenance therapy. DCPC's trade-offs were a higher cumulative incidence of depression and more lifetime depressive episodes. Life expectancy was identical under usual care and DCPC. Sensitivity analyses indicate that DCPC was almost always preferable to usual care.  Conclusion:   Compared with usual care, DCPC may offer more value to US patients with prostate cancer.

For this purpose, we used urine and serum samples to detect any significant differences in miRNA profiles between patients and healthy controls.  Materials and methods:   Total ribonucleic acid (RNA) in urine and serum samples were isolated from eight untreated PC patients, thirty healthy individuals were screened for miRNA profile, and candidate miRNAs were validated. Whole urinary and serum miRNA profile was analyzed using Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA 4.0 Arrays. Candidate miRNAs were investigated by stem-loop reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction.  Results:   When we analyzed the urinary samples of PC patients, 49 miRNAs were detected to be upregulated and 14 miRNAs were found to be downregulated when compared with healthy controls. According to the serum samples, 19 miRNAs were found to be upregulated, and 21 miRNAs were found to be downregulated when compared with healthy individuals as well.

ECE affects our decision on treatment strategy. The aim of this study is to identify the predictors of ECE, determine cut-off values, and compare them with the accuracy of Partin Table parameters to improve tumor staging in clinical practice.  Materials and methods:   374 patients with clinically localized PCa who underwent open radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) were included in this study. Gleason Score (GS), age, digital rectal examination (DRE), prostate specific antigen (PSA), prostate specific antigen density (PSAD), free PSA, Free/Total PSA, prostate volume (PV), number of cores involved, tumor length, and tumor percentage in maximum involved core in biopsy were investigated.  Results:   PSAD, tumor percentage, and tumor length are predictive factors of ECE. The cut-off values of PSA, PSAD, maximum tumor length, and maximum tumor percentages in predicting ECE are: > 8.90 ng/mL, > 0.26 ng/mL2, >5mm, and >50%, respectively. The cut-off values for Partin extraprostatic extension (EPE) and organ confined (OC) disease are >29% and ≤ 64%, respectively.  Conclusion:   Partin tables could better predict extracapsular extension in clinically localized PCa if they include PSAD, tumor percentage, and tumor length.

Another pathway named targeted biopsy is using multiparametric MRI to localise the tumour precisely and then obtain the samples from the suspicious lesions. Targeted biopsy, which is mainly divided into cognitive fusion method and software-based fusion method, is getting prevalent for its good performance in detecting significant cancer. However, the preferred targeted biopsy technique in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer between cognitive fusion and software-based fusion is still beyond consensus.  Methods and analysis:   This trial is a prospective, single-centre, randomised controlled and non-inferiority study in which all men suspicious to have clinically significant prostate cancer are included. This study aims to determine whether a novel three-dimensional matrix positioning cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy is non-inferior to software-based fusion-targeted biopsy in the detection rate of clinically significant cancer in men without a prior biopsy. The main inclusion criteria are men with elevated serum prostate-specific antigen above 4-20 ng/mL or with an abnormal digital rectal examination and have never had a biopsy before. A sample size of 602 participants allowing for a 10% loss will be recruited. All patients will undergo a multiparametric MRI examination, and those who fail to be found with a suspicious lesion, with the anticipation of half of the total number, will be dropped. The remaining participants will be randomly allocated to cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy (n=137) and software-based fusion-targeted biopsy (n=137). The primary outcome is the detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer for cognitive fusion-targeted biopsy and software-based fusion-targeted biopsy in men without a prior biopsy. The clinically significant prostate cancer will be defined as the International Society of Urological Pathology grade group 2 or higher.

The PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is a key immunosuppressive mechanism for cancer cells to avoid eradication by CAR-T cells. In this study, the shRNA (short hair RNA) gene-silencing technique was used to construct the third-generation of CAR-T cells with PD-1 silencing which targeted CD19 antigen (CD19/△PD-1 CAR-T) and prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA/△PD-1 CAR-T), thereby blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in treatment of lymphoma and prostate subcutaneous xenograft and enhancing the anti-tumor effect of CAR-T cells. The cell experiments showed that PD-1 silencing in CAR-T cells effectively blocked the PD-1 / PD-L1 pathway. When the ratio of effector to target cell is 8:1, △PD-1 CAR-T cells exhibited higher killing ability and cytokine releasing ability than normal CAR-T cells did. The subcutaneous tumor models were constructed using human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells expressing CD19 (K562-CD19) and human prostate cancer cells expressing PSCA (PC3-PSCA), and treated with CD19/△PD-1 CAR-T and PSCA/△PD-1 CAR-T cells, respectively. The tumor volumes significantly reduced within one week, indicating the good tumor growth inhibitory effect of △PD-1 CAR-T cells. Mice injected with △PD-1 CAR-T cells showed a significantly prolonged survival time compared to those with normal CAR-T cells. This study proved that shRNA-mediated PD-1 silencing technology is an effective strategy for blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 immunosuppression pathway and enhancing the therapeutic effect of CAR-T cells on subcutaneous xenograft. SUMMARY: The effect of CAR-T in treating solid tumors has not been as successful as that in hematological malignancies. The key immunosuppressive mechanism is the expression of PD-1/PD-L1. We used gene silencing technique mediated by shRNA (short hair RNA) to block the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in lymphoma and prostate tumors, thus enhancing the anti-tumor effect of CAR-T cells on subcutaneous xenograft.""","""['Jing-E Zhou', 'Jing Yu', 'Yeying Wang', 'Hao Wang', 'Jing Wang', 'Yiting Wang', 'Lei Yu', 'Zhiqiang Yan']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Biomed Pharmacother""","""['CD19-specific CAR T Cells that Express a PD-1/CD28 Chimeric Switch-Receptor are Effective in Patients with PD-L1-positive B-Cell Lymphoma.', 'Secretion of human soluble programmed cell death protein 1 by chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells enhances anti-tumor efficacy.', 'PD-1 silencing improves anti-tumor activities of human mesothelin-targeted CAR T cells.', 'CAR T-Cell Therapy in Hematological Malignancies.', 'Chimeric antigen receptor-engineered T cells for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer.', 'RNA Therapeutics for Improving CAR T-cell Safety and Efficacy.', 'Radiotherapy plus CAR-T cell therapy to date: A note for cautions optimism?', 'Signaling Pathways and Targeted Therapies for Stem Cells in Prostate Cancer.', 'Successful application of PD-1 knockdown CLL-1 CAR-T therapy in two AML patients with post-transplant relapse and failure of anti-CD38 CAR-T cell treatment.', 'What Do We Have to Know about PD-L1 Expression in Prostate Cancer?

However, identifying the presence and extent of cancer on MRI remains challenging, leading to high variability in detection even among expert radiologists. Improvement in cancer detection on MRI is essential to reducing this variability and maximizing the clinical utility of MRI. To date, such improvement has been limited by the lack of accurately labeled MRI datasets. Data from patients who underwent radical prostatectomy enables the spatial alignment of digitized histopathology images of the resected prostate with corresponding pre-surgical MRI. This alignment facilitates the delineation of detailed cancer labels on MRI via the projection of cancer from histopathology images onto MRI. We introduce a framework that performs 3D registration of whole-mount histopathology images to pre-surgical MRI in three steps. First, we developed a novel multi-image super-resolution generative adversarial network (miSRGAN), which learns information useful for 3D registration by producing a reconstructed 3D MRI. Second, we trained the network to learn information between histopathology slices to facilitate the application of 3D registration methods. Third, we registered the reconstructed 3D histopathology volumes to the reconstructed 3D MRI, mapping the extent of cancer from histopathology images onto MRI without the need for slice-to-slice correspondence. When compared to interpolation methods, our super-resolution reconstruction resulted in the highest PSNR relative to clinical 3D MRI (32.15 dB vs 30.16 dB for BSpline interpolation). Moreover, the registration of 3D volumes reconstructed via super-resolution for both MRI and histopathology images showed the best alignment of cancer regions when compared to (1) the state-of-the-art RAPSODI approach, (2) volumes that were not reconstructed, or (3) volumes that were reconstructed using nearest neighbor, linear, or BSpline interpolations. The improved 3D alignment of histopathology images and MRI facilitates the projection of accurate cancer labels on MRI, allowing for the development of improved MRI interpretation schemes and machine learning models to automatically detect cancer on MRI.""","""['Rewa R Sood', 'Wei Shao', 'Christian Kunder', 'Nikola C Teslovich', 'Jeffrey B Wang', 'Simon J C Soerensen', 'Nikhil Madhuripan', 'Anugayathri Jawahar', 'James D Brooks', 'Pejman Ghanouni', 'Richard E Fan', 'Geoffrey A Sonn', 'Mirabela Rusu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Image Anal""","""['A review of artificial intelligence in prostate cancer detection on imaging.', 'Bridging the gap between prostate radiology and pathology through machine learning.', 'Registration of presurgical MRI and histopathology images from radical prostatectomy via RAPSODI.', 'ProsRegNet: A deep learning framework for registration of MRI and histopathology images of the prostate.', '3D MRI Reconstruction Based on 2D Generative Adversarial Network Super-Resolution.', 'Homologous point transformer for multi-modality prostate image registration.', 'A review of artificial intelligence in prostate cancer detection on imaging.', 'Automated nonlinear registration of coronary PET to CT angiography using pseudo-CT generated from PET with generative adversarial networks.', 'Texture Analysis of Enhanced MRI and Pathological Slides Predicts EGFR Mutation Status in Breast Cancer.', 'Bridging the gap between prostate radiology and pathology through machine learning.']"""

Current models rely on prespecified variables, which limits their performance. We aimed to investigate a novel machine learning approach to develop an improved prognostic model for predicting 10-year prostate cancer-specific mortality and compare its performance with existing validated models.  Methods:   We derived and tested a machine learning-based model using Survival Quilts, an algorithm that automatically selects and tunes ensembles of survival models using clinicopathological variables. Our study involved a US population-based cohort of 171 942 men diagnosed with non-metastatic prostate cancer between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2016, from the prospectively maintained Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. The primary outcome was prediction of 10-year prostate cancer-specific mortality. Model discrimination was assessed using the concordance index (c-index), and calibration was assessed using Brier scores. The Survival Quilts model was compared with nine other prognostic models in clinical use, and decision curve analysis was done.  Findings:   647 151 men with prostate cancer were enrolled into the SEER database, of whom 171 942 were included in this study. Discrimination improved with greater granularity, and multivariable models outperformed tier-based models. The Survival Quilts model showed good discrimination (c-index 0·829, 95% CI 0·820-0·838) for 10-year prostate cancer-specific mortality, which was similar to the top-ranked multivariable models: PREDICT Prostate (0·820, 0·811-0·829) and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) nomogram (0·787, 0·776-0·798). All three multivariable models showed good calibration with low Brier scores (Survival Quilts 0·036, 95% CI 0·035-0·037; PREDICT Prostate 0·036, 0·035-0·037; MSKCC 0·037, 0·035-0·039). Of the tier-based systems, the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment model (c-index 0·782, 95% CI 0·771-0·793) and Cambridge Prognostic Groups model (0·779, 0·767-0·791) showed higher discrimination for predicting 10-year prostate cancer-specific mortality. c-indices for models from the National Comprehensive Cancer Care Network, Genitourinary Radiation Oncologists of Canada, American Urological Association, European Association of Urology, and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ranged from 0·711 (0·701-0·721) to 0·761 (0·750-0·772). Discrimination for the Survival Quilts model was maintained when stratified by age and ethnicity. Decision curve analysis showed an incremental net benefit from the Survival Quilts model compared with the MSKCC and PREDICT Prostate models currently used in practice.  Interpretation:   A novel machine learning-based approach produced a prognostic model, Survival Quilts, with discrimination for 10-year prostate cancer-specific mortality similar to the top-ranked prognostic models, using only standard clinicopathological variables. Future integration of additional data will likely improve model performance and accuracy for personalised prognostics.

Since osteotropic metastasis of prostate cancer is a critical determinant of patients' survival, searches for preventive measures are ongoing in the field. Therefore, it is important to dissect the mechanisms of each step of bone metastasis, including the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cross-talk between metastatic niches and cancer cells.  Methods:   In this study, we established a highly bone-metastatic subline of human prostate cancer cells by selecting bone-homing population of PC3 cells after cardiac injection of eight-week-old male BALB/c-nude mice. Then we assessed the proliferation, EMT characteristics, and migration properties of the subline (mtPC3) cells in comparison with the parental PC3 cells. To investigate the role of S100A4, we performed gene knock-down by lentiviral transduction, or treated cells with recombinant S100A4 protein or a S100A4-neutralizing antibody. The effect of cancer cells on osteoclastogenesis was evaluated after treatment of pre-osteoclasts with conditioned medium (CM) from cancer cells.  Results:   The mtPC3 cells secreted a markedly high level of S100A4 protein and showed elevated cell proliferation and mesenchymal properties. The increased proliferation and EMT traits of mtPC3 cells was inhibited by S100A4 knock-down, but was not affected by exogenous S100A4. Furthermore, S100A4 released from mtPC3 cells stimulated osteoclast development via the cell surface receptor RAGE. Down-regulation or neutralization of S100A4 in the CM of mtPC3 cells attenuated cancer-induced osteoclastogenesis.  Conclusion:   Altogether, our results suggest that intracellular S100A4 promotes cell proliferation and EMT characteristics in tumor cells, and that secreted S100A4 activates osteoclastogenesis, contributing to osteolytic bone metastasis. Thus, S100A4 upregulation in cancer cells highly metastatic to bone might be a key element in regulating bone metastasis.""","""['Bongjun Kim#', 'Suhan Jung#', 'Haemin Kim', 'Jun-Oh Kwon', 'Min-Kyoung Song', 'Min Kyung Kim', 'Hyung Joon Kim', 'Hong-Hee Kim']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['miR-325-3p, a novel regulator of osteoclastogenesis in osteolysis of colorectal cancer through targeting S100A4.', 'CCN3 promotes prostate cancer bone metastasis by modulating the tumor-bone microenvironment through RANKL-dependent pathway.', 'Invasion and increased expression of S100A4 and CYR61 in mesenchymal transformed breast cancer cells is downregulated by GnRH.', 'The function of S100A4 in pulmonary disease: A review.', 'Melatonin Inhibits Osteoclastogenesis and Osteolytic Bone Metastasis: Implications for Osteoporosis.', 'Tumor-Targeting Extracellular Vesicles Loaded with siS100A4 for Suppressing Postoperative Breast Cancer Metastasis.', 'Cantharidin and Its Analogue Norcantharidin Inhibit Metastasis-Inducing Genes S100A4 and MACC1.', 'Follow-Up Biomarkers in the Evolution of Prostate Cancer, Levels of S100A4 as a Detector in Plasma.', 'Dihydromyricetin Inhibited Migration and Invasion by Reducing S100A4 Expression through ERK1/2/β-Catenin Pathway in Human Cervical Cancer Cell Lines.', 'S100 Proteins in Fatty Liver Disease and Hepatocellular Carcinoma.']"""

Several measures have been proposed to reduce the rectal doses, such as use of a radioprotective spacer to shift the rectum away from the lesion or an endorectal balloon to reduce the internal target volume (ITV). The removal of rectal gas is supposed to achieve the similar effect by reducing the rectal volume and ITV. This is because the distance of the rectum to lesions can be increased with decreasing rectal volumes, which also makes it easy for physicists to avoid the rectum during field design. Besides, a reduced ITV can be obtained due to stability in rectal volume, as with use of an endorectal balloon. The procedure is most suitable for patients receiving stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and high dose rate brachytherapy (HDR-BR) because of limited treatment sessions. In this study, we showed that the rectal dose decreased significantly with rectal gas extraction, as manifested by dose parameters of D2 cm3 and D0.1 cm3 (the doses delivered to the most exposed 2 cm, 3 and 0.1 cm3 of the rectum, respectively).

Soy isoflavones decreased the circulating levels of pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone, inhibited aldosterone secretion, as well as corticosterone production and secretion, but stimulated dehydroepiandrosterone secretion, all in andropausal rats. In vitro studies indicate that the mechanism underlying these hormonal changes relies on inhibition of the pituitary tyrosine kinase and adrenocortical 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymes by soy isoflavones. Although the clinical studies are in their infancy, the opinion is that genistein and daidzein have therapeutic potential for the safe treatment of ageing-caused androgen deprivation and glucocorticoid excess with related metabolic/hemodynamic issues in males. Our accumulated experience and knowledge in the field of biomedical effects of plant polyphenols have provided a platform for potential recommending the agenda to organize and accelerate experimental research aimed at producing the optimal supplementation. We hypothesize that an in vivo approach should first be exploited in the sequence of investigative steps, followed by in vitro studies and synchronously conducted molecular docking analyses. In vivo research, besides establishing the margin of exposure safety or adjustment of the correct polyphenol dose, enables identification and quantification of the metabolites of applied polyphenols in the blood. Subsequent in vitro exploitation of the metabolites and related docking analyses provide clarification of the molecular mechanisms of action of applied polyphenols. Chemical modification of the polyphenol structure or coupling it with nanoparticles might be the next step in optimizing the design of supplementation. Selected, intact or chemically-modified polyphenol molecules should be included in preclinical studies on a more closely-related species, while clinical studies would finally assess the safety and effectiveness of a polyphenol-based remedial strategy.

Methods:   In this retrospective study, a total of 253 patients with BCR who underwent restaging 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT were assessed. Two urologists specialized in uro-oncology were asked to formulate a preferred treatment for each patient before and after knowing the results of the 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT.

Furthermore, additional late imaging in PSMA PET/CT provides a useful method to clarify uncertain findings. The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate a modified imaging protocol combining late additional imaging with hydration and forced diuresis in individuals undergoing additional late scanning for uncertain lesions or low prostate-specific antigen. Methods: We compared an older protocol with a newer one. In the old protocol, patients undergoing 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT were examined at 90 min after injection, with 1 L of oral hydration beginning at 30 min after injection and 20 mg of furosemide given intravenously at 1 h after injection, followed by additional late imaging at 2.5 h after injection without further preparation. In the new protocol, a second group received the same procedure as before, with an additional 0.5 L of oral hydration and 10 mg of furosemide intravenously 30 min before the late imaging. We examined 132 patients (76 with the old protocol and 56 with the new one) with respect to urinary bladder activity (SUVmean), prostate cancer lesion uptake (SUVmax), and lesion contrast (ratio of tumor SUVmax to bladder SUVmean for local relapses and ratio of tumor SUVmax to gluteal-muscle SUVmean for nonlocal prostate cancer lesions). Results: Bladder activity was significantly greater for the old protocol in the late scans than for the new protocol (ratio of bladder activity at 2.5 h to bladder activity at 1.5 h, 2.33 ± 1.17 vs. 1.37 ± 0.50, P < 0.0001). Increased tumor SUVmax and contrast were seen at 2.5 h compared with 1.5 h (P < 0.0001 for old protocol; P = 0.02 for new protocol). Increased bladder activity for the old protocol resulted in decreased lesion-to-bladder contrast, which was not the case for the new protocol. Tumor-to-background ratios increased at late imaging for both protocols, but the increase was significantly lower for the new protocol. For the old protocol, comparing the 1.5-h to the 2.5-h acquisitions, 4 lesions in 4 patients (4/76 = 5.2% of the cohort) were visible at the postdiuresis 1.5-h acquisition but not at 2.5 h, having been obscured as a result of the higher bladder activity. In the new protocol, 2 of 56 (3.6%) patients had lesions visible only at late imaging, and 2 patients had lesions that could be better discriminated at late imaging. Conclusion: Although the combination of diuretics and hydration can be a useful method to increase the visualization and detectability of locally recurrent prostate cancer in standard 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, their effects do not sufficiently continue into additional late imaging. Additional diuresis and hydration are recommended to improve the visibility, detection, and diagnostic certainty of local recurrences.""","""['Ian Alberts', 'Jan Niklas-Hünermund', 'Christos Sachpekidis', 'Helle Damgaard Zacho', 'Clemens Mingels', 'Lotte Dijkstra', 'Karl Peter Bohn', 'Tilman Läppchen', 'Eleni Gourni', 'Axel Rominger', 'Ali Afshar-Oromieh']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Combined forced diuresis and late acquisition on 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT for biochemical recurrent prostate cancer: a clinical practice-oriented study.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Early Injection of Furosemide Increases Detection Rate of Local Recurrence in Prostate Cancer Patients with Biochemical Recurrence Referred for 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT.', '68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in patients with recurrent prostate cancer-a modified protocol compared with the common protocol.', 'Impact of forced diuresis with furosemide and hydration on the halo artefact and intensity of tracer accumulation in the urinary bladder and kidneys on 68GaGa-PSMA-11-PET/CT in the evaluation of prostate cancer patients.', 'Up-to-Date Imaging and Diagnostic Techniques for Prostate Cancer: A Literature Review.', 'Long-axial field-of-view PET/CT: perspectives and review of a revolutionary development in nuclear medicine based on clinical experience in over 7000 patients.', 'Combined forced diuresis and late acquisition on 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT for biochemical recurrent prostate cancer: a clinical practice-oriented study.', 'Evaluation of 68\xa0GaGa-PSMA-I&T PET/CT with additional late scans of the pelvis in prostate-specific antigen recurrence using the PROMISE criteria.', 'Hybrid imaging with 68GaPSMA-11 PET-CT and PET-MRI in biochemically recurrent prostate cancer.']"""

Although variability in biodistribution and affinity for binding to the PSMA receptor is known to exist between different PSMA-targeting radiopharmaceuticals, little is known about the clinical implications of this variability. Therefore, this study analyzed differences in interreader agreement and detection rate between 2 regularly used 18F-labeled PSMA receptor-targeting radiopharmaceuticals: 18F-DCFPyL and 18F-PSMA-1007. Methods: One hundred twenty consecutive patients scanned with 18F-PSMA-1007 were match-paired with 120 patients scanned with 18F-DCFPyL. All 240 PET/CT scans were reviewed by 2 readers and scored according to the criteria of the PSMA Reporting and Data System. Interreader agreement and the detection rate for suspected lesions were scored for different anatomic locations such as the prostate, prostatic fossa, lymph nodes, and bone. Results: Great equality was found between 18F-DCFPyL and 18F-PSMA-1007; however, some clinically relevant and statistically significant differences were observed. 18F-PSMA-1007 detected suspected prostatic or prostatic fossa lesions in a higher proportion of patients and especially in the subcohort scanned for biochemical recurrence. 18F-DCFPyL and 18F-PSMA-1007 showed an equal ability to detect suspected lymph nodes, although interreader agreement for 18F-DCFPyL was higher. 18F-DCFPyL showed fewer equivocal skeletal lesions and higher interreader agreement on skeletal lesions. Most of the equivocal lesions found with 18F-PSMA-1007 at least were determined to be of nonmetastatic origin. Conclusion: Clinically relevant differences, which may account for diagnostic dilemmas, were observed between 18F-DCFPyL and 18F-PSMA-1007.

For this reason, we aimed to define the added value of SNB (with different tracer modalities) to ePLND in the identification of nodal metastases. Complication rates and oncologic outcomes were also assessed. Methods: From January 2006 to December 2019, prospectively collected data were retrospectively analyzed from a single-institution database regarding prostate cancer patients treated with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and ePLND with or without additional use of SNB, either with the hybrid tracer indocyanine green (ICG)-99mTc-nanocolloid or with free ICG. Multivariable logistic and Cox regression models tested the impact of adding SNB (either with the hybrid tracer or with free ICG) on lymph nodal invasion detection, complications, and oncologic outcomes. Results: Overall, 1,680 patients were included in the final analysis: 1,168 (69.5%) in the non-SNB group, 161 (9.6%) in the ICG-SNB group, and 351 (20.9%) in the hybrid-SNB group. The hybrid-SNB group (odds ratio, 1.61; 95%CI, 1.18-2.20; P = 0.002) was an independent predictor of nodal involvement, whereas the ICG-SNB group did not reach independent predictor status when compared with the non-SNB group (odds ratio, 1.35; 95%CI, 0.89-2.03; P = 0.1). SNB techniques were not associated with higher rates of complications. Lastly, use of hybrid SNB was associated with lower rates of biochemical recurrence (0.79; 95%CI, 0.63-0.98) and of clinical recurrence (hazard ratio, 0.76, P = 0.035) than were seen in the non-SNB group.

There is an urgent need to better understand androgen-regulated cellular processes to more effectively target the AR dependence of prostate cancer cells through new therapeutic vulnerabilities. Transcriptomic studies have consistently identified lipid metabolism as a hallmark of enhanced AR signaling in prostate cancer, yet the relationship between AR and the lipidome remains undefined. Using mass spectrometry-based lipidomics, this study reveals increased fatty acyl chain length in phospholipids from prostate cancer cells and patient-derived explants as one of the most striking androgen-regulated changes to lipid metabolism. Potent and direct AR-mediated induction of ELOVL fatty acid elongase 5 (ELOVL5), an enzyme that catalyzes fatty acid elongation, was demonstrated in prostate cancer cells, xenografts, and clinical tumors. Assessment of mRNA and protein in large-scale data sets revealed ELOVL5 as the predominant ELOVL expressed and upregulated in prostate cancer compared with nonmalignant prostate. ELOVL5 depletion markedly altered mitochondrial morphology and function, leading to excess generation of reactive oxygen species and resulting in suppression of prostate cancer cell proliferation, 3D growth, and in vivo tumor growth and metastasis. Supplementation with the monounsaturated fatty acid cis-vaccenic acid, a direct product of ELOVL5 elongation, reversed the oxidative stress and associated cell proliferation and migration effects of ELOVL5 knockdown. Collectively, these results identify lipid elongation as a protumorigenic metabolic pathway in prostate cancer that is androgen-regulated, critical for metastasis, and targetable via ELOVL5.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on urology surgical waiting list in a high-volume hospital.  Methods:   An observational descriptive study was designed. All patients included in the urology surgical waiting list of our high-volume center on May 1st 2020 (46 days after the suspension of elective surgery) were analyzed. Baseline variables, priority on the waiting list, main urological disease, type of scheduled surgery, and waiting time were recorded. Other variables recorded were the presence of a urinary catheter, number of accesses to the emergency department, evidence of COVID-19 infection, number of deaths and their cause. The waiting time for each disease was compared with the time to surgery in 2019.  Results:   A total of 350 patients were included. The mean (SD) time on the waiting list was 97.33 (55.47) days. Priority 1 patients, who normally should undergo surgery within 30 days, were on the waiting list for a mean (SD) time of 60.51 (20.14) days. They were mainly patients with ureteral lithiasis (25.6%), high-risk or muscle-invasive bladder cancer (20.9%) and high-risk prostate cancer (13.9%).

However, its mechanism in cancer cell remains largely unknown and whether there exist a deubiquitinase targeting c-Myc also remains elusive.  Methods:   Bioinformatic analysis and shRNA screening methods were used to identify potential deubiquitinases that correlate with c-Myc gene signature. Cell proliferation and viability were measured by Cell-Counting-Kit 8 and colony formation assays. A mouse xenograft model of PC3 cells was established to confirm the function of USP16 in vivo. The interaction between USP16 and c-Myc protein was assessed by co-immunoprecipitation and protein co-localization assays. Immunohistochemistry staining was performed to detect the expression of USP16, Ki67, and c-Myc in xenograft tissues and clinical tumour tissues. Furthermore, the correlation between USP16 and c-Myc was confirmed by RNA sequencing.  Results:   Functional analyses identified USP16, known as a deubiquitinase, was strongly correlated with the c-Myc gene signature. Depletion of USP16 was shown to significantly suppress the growth of PCa cells both in vitro and in vivo. Co-immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assays confirmed that USP16 served as a novel deubiquitinase of c-Myc and overexpression of c-Myc significantly rescued the effects of USP16 disruption. Immunohistochemistry staining and RNA-seq tactics were further used to confirm the positive correlation between USP16 and c-Myc expression. Expression of USP16 in human PCa tissues was higher than that seen in normal prostate tissues and its high expression was found associated with poor prognosis.  Conclusions:   USP16 serves as a novel deubiquitinase of c-Myc. Downregulation of USP16 markedly suppressed PCa cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. USP16 regulates PCa cell proliferation by deubiquitinating and stabilizing c-Myc, making it a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of PCa.""","""['Jianchao Ge#', 'Wandong Yu#', 'Junhong Li', 'Hangbin Ma', 'Pengyu Wang', 'Yinghao Zhou', 'Yang Wang', 'Jun Zhang', 'Guowei Shi']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['The Pleiotropic Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 16 and Its Many Substrates.', 'NDRG2 acts as a negative regulator downstream of androgen receptor and inhibits the growth of androgen-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Reversible lysine-specific demethylase 1 antagonist HCI-2509 inhibits growth and decreases c-MYC in castration- and docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'USP16 Downregulation by Carboxyl-terminal Truncated HBx Promotes the Growth of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells.', 'SOX4 is activated by C-MYC in prostate cancer.', 'A review of deubiquitinases and thier roles in tumorigenesis and development.', 'Investigating In Situ Expression of c-MYC and Candidate Ubiquitin-Specific Proteases in DLBCL and Assessment for Peptidyl Disruptor Molecule against c-MYC-USP37 Complex.', 'The Pleiotropic Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 16 and Its Many Substrates.', 'Ubiquitin specific peptidases and prostate cancer.', 'Deubiquitinase USP35 stabilizes BRPF1 to activate mevalonate (MVA) metabolism during prostate tumorigenesis.']"""

This necessitates innovative approaches that consider treatment side effects in addition to tumor cure. Current treatment-planning methods rely on constrained iterative optimization of dose distributions as a surrogate for health outcomes. The goal of this study was to develop a generally applicable method to directly optimize projected health outcomes. We developed an outcome-based objective function to guide selection of the number, angle, and relative fluence weight of photon and proton radiotherapy beams in a sample of ten prostate-cancer patients by optimizing the projected health outcome. We tested whether outcome-optimized radiotherapy (OORT) improved the projected longitudinal outcome compared to dose-optimized radiotherapy (DORT) first for a statistically significant majority of patients, then for each individual patient. We assessed whether the results were influenced by the selection of treatment modality, late-risk model, or host factors. The results of this study revealed that OORT was superior to DORT. Namely, OORT maintained or improved the projected health outcome of photon- and proton-therapy treatment plans for all ten patients compared to DORT. Furthermore, the results were qualitatively similar across three treatment modalities, six late-risk models, and 10 patients. The major finding of this work was that it is feasible to directly optimize the longitudinal (i.e. long- and short-term) health outcomes associated with the total (i.e. therapeutic and stray) absorbed dose in all of the tissues (i.e. healthy and diseased) in individual patients. This approach enables consideration of arbitrary treatment factors, host factors, health endpoints, and times of relevance to cancer survivorship. It also provides a simpler, more direct approach to realizing the full beneficial potential of cancer radiotherapy.""","""['Lydia J Wilson', 'Wayne D Newhauser']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Feasibility of MRI-only treatment planning for proton therapy in brain and prostate cancers: Dose calculation accuracy in substitute CT images.', 'A Monte-Carlo study to assess the effect of 1.5 T magnetic fields on the overall robustness of pencil-beam scanning proton radiotherapy plans for prostate cancer.', 'Treatment planning comparison of IMPT, VMAT and 4π radiotherapy for prostate cases.', 'Empowering Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy Through Physics and Technology: An Overview.', 'Robust radiotherapy planning.', 'Image-based data mining applies to data collected from children.']"""

For a set of patient plans, a convolutional neural network is trained on the dose of individual multi-leaf-collimator segments following the DeepDose framework. It can then be used to predict the dose distribution per segment for a set of patient anatomies. The network was trained using data from three anatomical sites of the abdomen: prostate, rectal and oligometastatic tumours. A total of 216 patient fractions were used, previously treated in our clinic with fixed-beam IMRT using the Elekta MR-linac. For the purpose of training, 176 fractions were used with random gantry angles assigned to each segment, while 20 fractions were used for the validation of the network. The ground truth data were calculated with a Monte Carlo dose engine at 1% statistical uncertainty per segment. For a total of 20 independent abdominal test fractions with the clinical angles, the network was able to accurately predict the dose distributions, achieving 99.4% ± 0.6% for the whole plan prediction at the 3%/3 mm gamma test. The average dose difference and standard deviation per segment was 0.3% ± 0.7%. Additional dose prediction on one cervical and one pancreatic case yielded high dose agreement of 99.9% and 99.8% respectively for the 3%/3 mm criterion.

Despite the increased clinical use of SBRT for PC, there is limited data on the relation between the actual delivered dose and toxicity. We aimed to identify dose parameters based on the total accumulated delivered bladder dose (DOSEACCTX). Furthermore, for future personalization, we studied whether prospective accumulation of the first 3 of 5 fractions (DOSEACC3FR) could be used as a representative of DOSEACCTX.  Materials and methods:   We deployed a recently validated deformable image registration-based dose accumulation strategy to reconstruct DOSEACCTX and DOSEACC3FR in 101 PC patients treated with stereotactic MRgRT. IPSS scores at baseline, end of MRgRT, at 6 and 12 weeks after treatment were analyzed to identify a clinically relevant increase of acute urinary symptoms. A receiver operator characteristic curve analysis was used to investigate the correlation of an increase in IPSS and bladder DOSEACCTX (range V5-V36.25 Gy, D1cc, D5cc) and DOSEACC3FR (range V6-V21.8 Gy, D1cc, D5cc) parameters.  Results:   A clinically relevant increase in IPSS in the three months following MRgRT was observed in 25 patients. The V20Gy-32Gy from DOSEACCTX and V15Gy-18Gy from DOSEACC3FR showed good correlation with IPSS increase with area under the curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.71 to 0.75. In contrast, baseline dosimetry showed a poor correlation with AUC values between 0.53 and 0.62.  Conclusion:   DOSEACCTX was superior to baseline dosimetry in predicting acute urinary symptoms. Because DOSEACC3FR also showed good correlation, this can potentially be used to optimize MRgRT for the remaining fractions.""","""['Omar Bohoudi', 'Anna M E Bruynzeel', 'Shyama Tetar', 'Ben J Slotman', 'Miguel A Palacios', 'Frank J Lagerwaard']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Accumulated bladder wall dose is correlated with patient-reported acute urinary toxicity in prostate cancer patients treated with stereotactic, daily adaptive MR-guided radiotherapy.', 'MR-guided adaptive versus ITV-based stereotactic body radiotherapy for hepatic metastases (MAESTRO): a randomized controlled phase II trial.', 'A Prospective Single-Arm Phase 2 Study of Stereotactic Magnetic Resonance Guided Adaptive Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer: Early Toxicity Results.', 'Medical physics challenges in clinical MR-guided radiotherapy.', 'MRI-guided Radiotherapy (MRgRT) for Treatment of Oligometastases: Review of Clinical Applications and Challenges.', 'Comparison of different dose accumulation strategies to estimate organ doses after stereotactic magnetic resonance-guided adaptive radiotherapy.', 'Dosimetric evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging-guided adaptive radiation therapy in pancreatic cancer by extent of re-contouring of organs-at-risk.', 'Magnetic Resonance-Guided Prostate Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy With Daily Online Plan Adaptation: Results of a Prospective Phase 1 Trial and Supplemental Cohort.']"""

Results:   Overall 51% of survivors had undergone a screening colonoscopy. However, there was a difference in CRC screening rate between prostate (54%) and breast (44%) cancer survivors. Older age (≥65 years), being a breast cancer survivor compared to prostate cancer, and living in a large compared to small metropolitan area were associated with a lower probability of receiving CRC screening.

Methods:   We introduce a DUL model to map the prostate contour from pCT to on-treatment CBCT. The DUL framework used a regional deformable model via narrow-band mapping to augment the conventional strategy. Two hundred and fifty-one anonymized CBCT images from prostate cancer patients were retrospectively selected and divided into three sets: 180 were used for training, 12 for validation, and 59 for testing. The testing dataset was divided into two groups. Group 1 contained 50 CBCT volumes, with one physician-generated prostate contour on CBCT image. Group 2 contained nine CBCT images, each including prostate contours delineated by four independent physicians and a consensus contour generated using the STAPLE method. Results were compared between the proposed DUL and physician-generated contours through the Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs), the Hausdorff distances, and the distances of the center-of-mass.  Results:   The average DSCs between DUL-based prostate contours and reference contours for test data in group 1 and group 2 consensus were 0.83 ± 0.04, and 0.85 ± 0.04, respectively.

Several MRI-derived markers, including the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) based on diffusion-weighted imaging, have been shown to provide values for prostate cancer detection and characterization. The hypothesis of the study was that docetaxel chemotherapy response could be picked up earlier with rotating frame relaxation times TRAFF2 and TRAFF4 than with the continuous wave T1ρ , adiabatic T1ρ , adiabatic T2ρ , T1 , T2 or water ADC. Human PC3 prostate cancer cells expressing a red fluorescent protein were implanted in 21 male mice. Docetaxel chemotherapy was given once a week starting 1 week after cell implantation for 10 randomly selected mice, while the rest served as a control group (n = 11). The MRI consisted of relaxation along a fictitious field (RAFF) in the second (RAFF2) and fourth (RAFF4) rotating frames, T1 and T2 , continuous wave T1ρ , adiabatic T1ρ and adiabatic T2ρ relaxation time measurements and water ADC. MRI was conducted at 7 T, once a week up to 4 weeks from cell implantation. The tumor volume was monitored using T2 -weighted MRI and optical imaging. The histology was evaluated after the last imaging time point. Significantly reduced RAFFn, T1ρ, T2ρ and conventional relaxation times 4 weeks after tumor implantation were observed in the treated tumors compared with the controls. The clearest short- and long-term responses were obtained with T1 , while no clear improvement in response to treatment was detected with novel methods compared with conventional methods or with RAFFn compared with all others. The tumor volume decreased after a two-week time point for the treated group and increased significantly in the control group, which was supported by increasing red fluorescent light emission in the control tumors. Decreased relaxation times were associated with successful chemotherapy outcomes.

However, due to the profusion of genes number, the performance of classifying DNA microarray gene expression data using statistical algorithms is often limited. Recently, there has been an important increase in the studies on the utilization of artificial intelligence methods, for the purpose of classifying large-scale data. In this context, a hybrid approach based on the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), the fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM), and the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is proposed in this study. The proposed method is applied to classify five different cancer datasets (i.e., lung cancer, central nervous system cancer, brain cancer, endometrial cancer, and prostate cancer). The backpropagation algorithm, hybrid algorithm, genetic algorithm, and the other statistical methods such as Bayesian network, support vector machine, and J48 decision tree are used to compare the proposed approach's performance to other algorithms. The results show that the performance of training FCM-based ANFIS using SA algorithm for classifying all the cancer datasets becomes more successful with the average accuracy rate of 96.28% and the results of the other methods are also satisfactory. The proposed method gives more effective results than the others for classifying DNA microarray cancer gene expression data.

Methods:   The centres, which contributed to this study, were the departments of nuclear medicine of Heidelberg (Germany), Technical University of Munich (Germany) and Albert Einstein Hospital of São Paulo (Brazil). A total of 2533 patients who were scanned with [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT at 1 h p.i. due to recurrent PC after prostatectomy were included in this retrospective analysis. Exclusion criteria were as follows: patients with untreated primary tumour, previous chemotherapy or Xofigo®; those previously treated with exclusively external beam radiation therapy or HIFU; those referred for PSMA-therapy; and those treated with ADT (including first- and second-generation ADT) within the last 6 months. Potential influences of different factors such as PSA level, PSA doubling-time (PSADT), PSA velocity (PSAVel), Gleason Score (GSC, including the separate analysis of 7a and 7b), age and amount of injected tracer were evaluated in a multivariable analysis.  Results:   The rate of pathologic PET/CT-scans was 43% for PSA ≤ 0.2 ng/ml, 58% for PSA > 0.2 to ≤ 0.5, 72% for PSA > 0.5 to ≤ 1.0 and increased to a maximum of 93% for PSA > 10 ng/ml. A pathological PET/CT was significantly (p = 0.001) associated with PSA level and higher GSC.

We retrospectively analyzed paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 33 metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients whose clinical outcomes had been tracked after docetaxel treatment. The expression status of lipocalin-2 was defined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using the anti-lipocalin-2 antibody. Lipocalin-2 was highly expressed in 36% of the examined specimens. There was no significant correlation between high lipocalin-2 expression and docetaxel response (p : 0.09). High lipocalin-2 expression was signiﬁcantly associated with a higher Gleason score (p=0.027). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis failed to show a significant correlation between expression levels of lipocalin-2 and both OS and PFS although patients with high lipocalin-2 levels had a numerically shorter PFS and OS time compared to patients with low levels.

Combining computational methods and clinical expertise, we curated clusters that represent 46 clinical conditions as potential risk factors for death after a COVID-19 infection. We trained age-stratified generalized linear models (GLMs) with component-wise gradient boosting to predict the probability of death based on what we know from the patients before they contracted the virus. Despite only relying on previously documented demographics and comorbidities, our models demonstrated similar performance to other prognostic models that require an assortment of symptoms, laboratory values, and images at the time of diagnosis or during the course of the illness. In general, we found age as the most important predictor of mortality in COVID-19 patients. A history of pneumonia, which is rarely asked in typical epidemiology studies, was one of the most important risk factors for predicting COVID-19 mortality. A history of diabetes with complications and cancer (breast and prostate) were notable risk factors for patients between the ages of 45 and 65 years. In patients aged 65-85 years, diseases that affect the pulmonary system, including interstitial lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and a smoking history, were important for predicting mortality.

Previous studies on the mechanism of SNHG1, an emerging lncRNA, have primarily focused on the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) mechanism. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism between SNHG1 and RBPs in tumors remains to be explored, especially in prostate cancer (PCa). SNHG1 expression profiles in PCa were determined through the analysis of TCGA data and tissue microarray at the RNA level. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were performed to investigate the biological role of SNHG1 in PCa initiation and progression. RNA-seq, immunoblotting, RNA pull-down and RNA immunoprecipitation analyses were utilized to clarify potential pathways with which SNHG1 might be involved. Finally, rescue experiments were carried out to further confirm this mechanism. We found that SNHG1 was dominantly expressed in the nuclei of PCa cells and significantly upregulated in PCa patients. The higher expression level of SNHG1 was dramatically correlated with tumor metastasis and patient survival. Functionally, overexpression of SNHG1 in PCa cells induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), accompanied by down-regulation of the epithelial marker, E-cadherin, and up-regulation of the mesenchymal marker, vimentin. Increased proliferation and migration, as well as accelerated xenograft tumor growth, were observed in SNHG1-overexpressing PCa cells, while opposite effects were achieved in SNHG1-silenced cells. Mechanistically, SNHG1 competitively interacted with hnRNPL to impair the translation of protein E-cadherin, thus activating the effect of SNHG1 on the EMT pathway, eventually promoting the metastasis of PCa. Our findings demonstrate that SNHG1 is a positive regulator of EMT activation through the SNHG1-hnRNPL-CDH1 axis.

There are currently no approved targeted drugs to specifically delay or overcome ENZ resistance.  Experimental design:   We selected several ENZ-resistant cell lines that replicated clinical characteristics of the majority of patients with ENZ-resistant disease. A high-throughput pharmacologic screen was utilized to identify compounds with greater cytotoxic effect for ENZ-resistant cell lines, compared with parental ENZ-sensitive cells. We validated the potential hits in vitro and in vivo, and used knockdown and overexpression assays to study the dependencies in ENZ-resistant prostate cancer.  Results:   ABT199 (BCL-2 inhibitor) and IMD0354 (IKKB inhibitor) were identified as potent and selective inhibitors of cell viability in ENZ-resistant cell lines in vitro and in vivo which were further validated using loss-of-function assays of BCL-2 and IKKB. Notably, we observed that overexpression of BCL-2 and IKKB in ENZ-sensitive cell lines was sufficient for the emergence of ENZ resistance. In addition, we confirmed that BCL-2 or IKKB inhibitors suppressed the development of ENZ resistance in xenografts. However, validation of both BCL-2 and IKKB in matched castration-sensitive/resistant clinical samples showed that, concurrent with the development of ENZ/abiraterone resistance in patients, only the protein levels of IKKB were increased.

Draft statements were presented at the face-to-face workshop for discussion and consensus building.  Results:   12 prostate cancer experts (9 urologists, 2 academics, 1 radiation oncologist) participated in this study from a range of geographical regions (4 USA, 4 Europe, 4 Australia). Complete agreement on statements presented to the participants was 29.4% after Round One and 69.0% after Round Two. Following robust discussions at the face-to-face workshop, agreement was reached on the remaining statements. PSA, PSA density, Multiparametric MRI, and systematic biopsy (with or without targeted biopsy) were identified as minimum diagnostic tests required upon which to select patients to recommend AS as a treatment option for prostate cancer. Patient factors and clinical parameters that identified patients appropriate to potentially receive AS were agreed. Genetic and genomic testing was not recommended for use in clinical decision-making regarding AS.  Conclusions:   The lack of consistency in the practice of AS for men with lower risk prostate cancer between and within countries was reflected in this modified Delphi study. There are, however, areas of common practice and agreement from which clinicians practicing in the current environment can use to inform their clinical practice to achieve the best outcomes for patients.""","""['Samuel W D Merriel', 'Daniel Moon', 'Phil Dundee', 'Niall Corcoran', 'Peter Carroll', 'Alan Partin', 'Joseph A Smith', 'Freddie Hamdy', 'Caroline Moore', 'Piet Ost', 'Tony Costello']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Best Current Practice and Research Priorities in Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer-A Report of a Movember International Consensus Meeting.', 'EAU-EANM-ESTRO-ESUR-SIOG Prostate Cancer Guideline Panel Consensus Statements for Deferred Treatment with Curative Intent for Localised Prostate Cancer from an International Collaborative Study (DETECTIVE Study).', 'Expert consensus document: Semantics in active surveillance for men with localized prostate cancer - results of a modified Delphi consensus procedure.', 'Utilization of multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging in clinical practice and focal therapy: report from a Delphi consensus project.', 'Selecting men diagnosed with prostate cancer for active surveillance using a risk calculator: a prospective impact study.', 'Developing a consensus statement for psychosocial support in active surveillance for prostate cancer.', 'National consensus quality indicators to assess quality of care for active surveillance in low-risk prostate cancer: An evidence-informed, modified Delphi survey of Canadian urologists/radiation oncologists.']"""

Cancer with bone metastases and oligometastases are associated with an intermediate or good prognosis. We assume that prolonged survival rates would be achieved if both the primary tumor and metastases are controlled by local treatment. Our purpose is to demonstrate, via a multicenter randomized phase III trial, that local treatment of metastatic sites with curative intent with SBRT associated of systemic standard of care treatment would improve the progression-free survival in patients with solid tumor (breast, prostate and non-small cell lung cancer) with up to 3 bone-only metastases compared to patients who received systemic standard of care treatment alone.  Methods:   This is an open-labeled randomized superiority multicenter phase III trial. Patients with up to 3 bone-only metastases will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio.between Arm A (Experimental group): Standard care of treatment & SBRT to all bone metastases, and Arm B (Control group): standard care of treatment. For patients receiving SBRT, radiotherapy dose and fractionation depends on the site of the bone metastasis and the proximity to critical normal structures. This study aims to accrue a total of 196 patients within 4 years. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival at 1 year, and secondary endpoints include Bone progression-free survival; Local control; Cancer-specific survival; Overall survival; Toxicity; Quality of life; Pain score analysis, Cost-utility analysis; Cost-effectiveness analysis and Budget impact analysis.  Discussion:   The expected benefit for the patient in the experimental arm is a longer expectancy of life without skeletal recurrence and the discomfort, pain and drastic reduction of mobility and handicap that the lack of local control of bone metastases eventually inflicts.

During the early stages of disease progression, tumour growth is local and androgen-dependent. Despite treatment, a large percentage of patients develop androgen-independent prostate cancer, which often results in metastases, a leading cause of mortality in these patients. Our previous work on the RNA-binding protein Staufen1 demonstrated its novel role in cancer biology, and in particular rhabdomyosarcoma tumorigenesis. To build upon this work, we have focused on the role of Staufen1 in other forms of cancer and describe here the novel and differential roles of Staufen1 in prostate cancer.  Methods:   Using a cell-based approach, three independent prostate cancer cell lines with different characteristics were used to evaluate the expression of Staufen1 in human prostate cancer relative to control prostate cells. The functional impact of Staufen1 on several key oncogenic features of prostate cancer cells including proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were systematically investigated.  Results:   We show that Staufen1 levels are increased in all human prostate cancer cells examined in comparison to normal prostate epithelial cells. Furthermore, Staufen1 differentially regulates growth, migration, and invasion in the various prostate cancer cells assessed. In LNCaP prostate cancer cells, Staufen1 regulates cell proliferation through mTOR activation. Conversely, Staufen1 regulates migration and invasion of the highly invasive, bone metastatic-derived, PC3 prostate cells via the activation of focal adhesion kinase.  Conclusions:   Collectively, these results show that Staufen1 has a direct impact in prostate cancer development and further demonstrate that its functions vary amongst the prostate cancer cell types. Accordingly, Staufen1 represents a novel target for the development of much-needed therapeutic strategies for prostate cancer.""","""['Kristen A Marcellus#', 'Tara E Crawford Parks#', 'Shekoufeh Almasi', 'Bernard J Jasmin']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Novel Roles for Staufen1 in Embryonal and Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma via c-myc-dependent and -independent events.', 'Loss of RBMS1 as a regulatory target of miR-106b influences cell growth, gap closing and colony forming in prostate carcinoma.', 'ING3 is associated with increased cell invasion and lethal outcome in ERG-negative prostate cancer patients.', 'Multiple roles of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 in promoting prostate cancer growth.', 'The multifunctional RNA-binding protein Staufen1: an emerging regulator of oncogenesis through its various roles in key cellular events.', 'Aberrant hyper-expression of the RNA binding protein GIGYF2 in endothelial cells modulates vascular aging and function.', 'Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES)-Mediated Translation and Its Potential for Novel mRNA-Based Therapy Development.', 'Phosphomimicry on STAU1 Serine 20 Impairs STAU1 Posttranscriptional Functions and Induces Apoptosis in Human Transformed Cells.', 'Targeting Protein Kinases and Epigenetic Control as Combinatorial Therapy Options for Advanced Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'High Level of Staufen1 Expression Confers Longer Recurrence Free Survival to Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients by Promoting THBS1 mRNA Degradation.']"""

As post-transplant survival increases, DNM represents an obstacle to further improving survival. We sought to examine the incidence, types, and risk factors for post-transplant DNM.  Methods:   We studied adult heart transplant recipients from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network database (1987-2018). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to determine annual probabilities of developing DNM, excluding squamous and basal cell carcinoma. Rates were compared to the general population in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to calculate hazard ratios for risk factors of DNM development, all-cause, and cancer-specific mortality.  Results:   Over median follow-up of 6.9 years, 18% of the 49,361 patients developed DNM, which correlated with an incidence rate 3.8 times that of the general population. The most common malignancies were lung, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, and prostate. Risk was most increased for female genital, tongue/throat, and renal cancers. Male gender, older age, smoking history, and impaired renal function were risk factors for developing DNM, whereas the use of MMF for immunosuppression was protective. Cigarette use, increasing age, the use of ATG for induction and calcineurin inhibitors for maintenance were risk factors for cancer-specific mortality. The development of a DNM increased the risk of death by 40% (p < .001).  Conclusions:   Heart transplant patients are at increased risk of malignancy, particularly rare cancers, which significantly increases their risk of death.

The purpose of this study was to report on the practice patterns and challenges of performing and interpreting prostate MRI. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. An electronic survey regarding prostate MRI practice patterns and challenges was sent to members of the Society of Abdominal Radiology. RESULTS. The response rate was 15% (212/1446). Most (65%) of the respondents were academic abdominal radiologists with 1-5 (52%), 6-10 (20%), 11-20 (15%), and more than 20 (5%) years of experience in reporting prostate MRI. The numbers of prostate MRI examinations reported per week were 0-5 (43%), 6-10 (38%), 11-20 (12%), 21-30 (5%), and more than 30 (2%). Imaging was performed at 3 T (58%), 1.5 T (20%), or either (21%), and most examinations (83%) were performed without an endorectal coil. Highest b values ranged from 800 to 5000 s/mm2; 1400 s/mm2 (26%) and 1500 s/mm2 (30%) were the most common. Most respondents (79%) acquired dynamic contrast-enhanced images with temporal resolution of less than 10 seconds. Most (71%) of the prostate MRI studies were used for fusion biopsy. PI-RADS version 2 was used by 92% of the respondents and template reporting by 80%. Challenges to performing and interpreting prostate MRI were scored on a 1-5 Likert scale (1, easy; 2, somewhat easy; 3, neutral; 4, somewhat difficult; 5, very difficult). The median scores were 2 or 3 for patient preparatory factors. Image acquisition and reporting factors were scored 1-2, except for performing spectroscopy or using an endorectal coil, both of which scored 4. Acquiring patient history scored 2 and quality factors scored 3. CONCLUSION. Most radiologists perform prostate MRI at 3 T without an endorectal coil and interpret the images using PI-RADS version 2. Challenges include obtaining quality images, acquiring feedback, and variability in the interpretation of PI-RADS scores.""","""['Silvia D Chang', 'Daniel J A Margolis', 'Baris Turkbey', 'Abigail A Arnold', 'Sadhna Verma']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""AJR Am J Roentgenol""","""[""Radiologists' preferences regarding content of prostate MRI reports: a survey of the Society of Abdominal Radiology."", ""Imaging Facilities' Adherence to PI-RADS v2 Minimum Technical Standards for the Performance of Prostate MRI."", 'Prostate MRI: access to and current practice of prostate MRI in the United States.', 'Review of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2.', 'Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeted Biopsy in Patients with a Prior Negative Biopsy: A Consensus Statement by AUA and SAR.', 'Multi-practice survey on MR imaging practice patterns in rectal cancer in the United States.']"""

Results:   The detection rate of PCa by targeted MRI/TRUS fusion prostate biopsy was higher than systematic prostate biopsy (38/81 vs. 33/81) in combinated group, but there was no significantly difference. The PCa detection rate in combinated group was significantly higher than systematic group (47/81 vs. 34/80, P = 0.049).

There are several technical challenges predominantly involving sample pre-treatment and preparation which have complicated the analysis of clinical tissues by MALDI-MSI. Firstly, the common embedding of samples in optimal cutting temperature (O.C.T.), which contains high concentrations of polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymers, causes analyte signal suppression during mass spectrometry (MS) by competing for available ions during ionisation. This suppressive effect has constrained the application of MALDI-MSI for the molecular mapping of clinical tissues. Secondly, the complexity of the mass spectra is obtained by the formation of multiple adduct ions. The process of analyte ion formation during MALDI can generate multiple m/z peaks from a single lipid species due to the presence of alkali salts in tissues, resulting in the suppression of protonated adduct formation and the generation of multiple near isobaric ions which produce overlapping spatial distributions. Presented is a method to simultaneously remove O.C.T. and endogenous salts. This approach was applied to lipid imaging in order to prevent analyte suppression, simplify data interpretation, and improve sensitivity by promoting lipid protonation and reducing the formation of alkali adducts.""","""['Jacob X M Truong', 'Xander Spotbeen', 'Jake White', 'Johannes V Swinnen', 'Lisa M Butler', 'Marten F Snel', 'Paul J Trim']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Anal Bioanal Chem""","""['Precast Gelatin-Based Molds for Tissue Embedding Compatible with Mass Spectrometry Imaging.', 'Evaluation of lipid coverage and high spatial resolution MALDI-imaging capabilities of oversampling combined with laser post-ionisation.', '2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid salts for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometric lipid analysis: simplified spectra interpretation and insights into gas-phase fragmentation.', 'Recent advances in matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) for in situ analysis of endogenous molecules in plants.', 'An update of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in lipid research.', 'Peptidomics.', 'Methods and applications for single-cell and spatial multi-omics.', 'Applications of spatially resolved omics in the field of endocrine tumors.', 'The role of altered lipid composition and distribution in liver fibrosis revealed by multimodal nonlinear optical microscopy.', 'An optimized approach and inflation media for obtaining complimentary mass spectrometry-based omics data from human lung tissue.']"""

Methods:   Data were analyzed as secondary outcomes of a randomized controlled trial of dietary supplementation with 20 g/d soy protein isolate, providing 41 mg/d total isoflavones and 23 mg/d genistein, in 44- to 75-y-old men who were at risk of cancer recurrence following prostatectomy randomized to soy (n = 50) or a casein-based placebo (n = 43). Weight, blood pressure, and blood samples were collected at baseline, every 2 mo in year 1, and every 3 mo in year 2.  Results:   Compared with casein, soy supplementation did not affect body weight, blood pressure, serum total cholesterol, calcium, phosphorus, and thyroid hormones. Serum ferritin concentrations doubled over 2 y in both groups (117-129%), whereas hemoglobin and hematocrit increased slightly. In an exploratory subgroup analysis of soy group data, weight increased in subjects producing equol but not in nonproducers. Blood pressure was reduced in nonequol producers but not in producers. Other endpoints were not affected by equol production status.  Conclusions:   Soy protein supplementation for 2 y compared with a casein-based placebo did not affect body weight, blood pressure, serum total cholesterol, iron status parameters, calcium, phosphorus, and thyroid hormones.

Understanding aspects of PRSs that contribute to this issue and determining solutions is complicated by disease-specific genetic architecture and limited knowledge of sharing of causal variants and effect sizes across populations. Motivated by these challenges, we undertook a simulation study to assess the relationship between ancestry and the potential bias in PRSs developed in European ancestry populations. Our simulations show that the magnitude of this bias increases with increasing divergence from European ancestry, and this is attributed to population differences in linkage disequilibrium and allele frequencies of European-discovered variants, likely as a result of genetic drift. Importantly, we find that including into the PRS variants discovered in African ancestry individuals has the potential to achieve unbiased estimates of genetic risk across global populations and admixed individuals. We confirm our simulation findings in an analysis of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), asthma, and prostate cancer in the UK Biobank.

Here, we evaluated the feasibility of increasing the delivery of PSMA-targeted magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) to tumors by enhancing vascular permeability in PSMA(+) PC tumors with PSMA-targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT). Method: PSMA(+) PC3 PIP tumor-bearing mice were given a low-molecular-weight PSMA-targeted photosensitizer and treated with fluorescence image-guided PDT, 4 h after. The mice were then given a PSMA-targeted MNP immediately after PDT and monitored with fluorescence imaging and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (T2-W MRI) 18 h, 42 h, and 66 h after MNP administration. Untreated PSMA(+) PC3 PIP tumor-bearing mice were used as negative controls. Results: An 8-fold increase in the delivery of the PSMA-targeted MNPs was detected using T2-W MRI in the pretreated tumors 42 h after PDT, compared to untreated tumors. Additionally, T2-W MRIs revealed enhanced peripheral intra-tumoral delivery of the PSMA-targeted MNPs.

Among them, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are vitally involved in the biological regulation of prostate cancer. In addition, lncRNAs are closely associated with the recurrence, metastasis and prognosis of prostate cancer. However, the molecular pathogenesis of lncRNAs in regulating cell growth and metastasis of prostate cancer remains unclear. Therefore, this study was designed to explore the function and mechanism of lncRNA RAMS11 in cell growth and metastasis of prostate cancer.  Methods:   Prostate cancer and para-carcinoma tissue samples were obtained from 42 patients who were diagnosed from March 2013 to September 2014 at Quanzhou First Hospital Affiliated to Fujian Medical University. Microarray experiments and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) measured the expression of lncRNA. RWPE-2, LNCap, PC3 and DU145 cells were used for an in vitro model.  Results:   The expression of lncRNA RAMS11 was up-regulated in prostate cancer tissue samples. LncRNA RAMS11 promoted cell growth and metastasis of prostate cancer cells. Down-regulation of lncRNA RAMS11 attenuated cell growth and metastasis of prostate cancer cells. We also demonstrated that lncRNA RAMS11 bound to CBX4 to activate expression of Top2α. LncRNA RAMS11 promoted tumor growth of prostate cancer in the mouse model. The inhibition of CBX4 attenuated the pro-cancer effects of lncRNA AMS11 in prostate cancer cells, while the activation of Top2α attenuated the anti-cancer effects of si-lncRNA RAMS11 in prostate cancer cells.  Discussion:   Our results indicated that lncRNA RAMS11 promoted cell growth and metastasis of prostate cancer by CBX4 complex via binding to Top2α, and might be developed for the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Zhixiong Zheng', 'Kaiyan Qiu', 'Weiwen Huang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Manag Res""","""['The Role of LINC01564, RAMS11, CBX4 and TOP2A in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Long non-coding RNA RAMS11 promotes metastatic colorectal cancer progression.', 'RAMS11 promotes CRC through mTOR-dependent inhibition of autophagy, suppression of apoptosis, and promotion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'Biological Function of Long Non-coding RNA (LncRNA) Xist.', 'Long noncoding RNAs: Novel insights into hepatocelluar carcinoma.', 'Importance of long non-coding RNAs in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Emerging RNA-Based Therapeutic and Diagnostic Options: Recent Advances and Future Challenges in Genitourinary Cancers.', 'Chromobox proteins in cancer: Multifaceted functions and strategies for modulation (Review).', 'The Role of LINC01564, RAMS11, CBX4 and TOP2A in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Cancer-Associated Dysregulation of Sumo Regulators: Proteases and Ligases.']"""

We examined socio-demographic differences in diagnosis at stage III/IV vs. I/II. Multiple imputation was used for missing stage at diagnosis (9% of tumours).

In this study, systematical analysis of ACSLs levels and the amount of fatty acyl-CoAs illustrated that ACSL1 were significantly associated with the levels of a broad spectrum of fatty acyl-CoAs, and were elevated in human prostate tumors.

Despite initial responsiveness to androgen deprivation, most patients with advanced prostate cancer subsequently progress to a clinically aggressive castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) phenotype, typically associated with expression of splice-variant or mutant AR forms. Although current evidence suggests that the vacuolar-ATPase (V-ATPase), a multiprotein complex that catalyzes proton transport across intracellular and plasma membranes, influences wild-type AR function, the effect of V-ATPase inhibition on variant AR function is unknown.Inhibition of V-ATPase reduced AR function in wild-type and mutant AR luciferase reporter models. In hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, DuCaP) and mutant AR CRPC cell lines (22Rv1, LNCaP-F877L/T878A), V-ATPase inhibition using bafilomycin-A1 and concanamycin-A reduced AR expression, and expression of AR target genes, at mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, combining chemical V-ATPase inhibition with the AR antagonist enzalutamide resulted in a greater reduction in AR downstream target expression than enzalutamide alone in LNCaP cells. To investigate the role of individual subunit isoforms, siRNA and CRISPR-Cas9 were used to target the V1C1 subunit in 22Rv1 cells.

Methods:   The evaluated data included age, PSA (ng/ml), PSA density, Gleason score, digital rectal examination (DRE), prostate volume of 149 patients. Twenty-seven patients (18%) had no previous prostate biopsy, 114 patients (77%) had a previous negative biopsy, and 8 patients (5%) were on active surveillance. Using PI-RADS v2 scores for mpMRI a second report was performed by a specialist uroradiologist. In all cases a subsequent transperineal biopsy was performed with at least 2 cores per target and additional background systemic cores. Initial and second-opinion radiology reports were evaluated for detection of any cancer and Gleason score (GS) 7-10 cancer, including positive predictive value and negative (NPV) and compared by Fisher's exact test.  Results:   At transperineal biopsy, 51 % (76/149) of patients had a GS 6-10 prostate cancer (PCa), 27 % (40/149) of patients had a GS 3 + 3 PCa and 12 % (18/149) a GS 3 + 4 and 12 % (18/149) had a GS ≥4 + 3 PCa. Agreement between initial and second-opinion reads was observed in 57.7% (86/149; kappa value = 0.32). The detection of clinically significant cancers with second-opinion reads was significantly higher (0.61; 17/28) compared to initial reads (0.35; 17/49); P = 0.034.  Conclusions:   Second reading of prostate mpMRIs by subspecialised uroradiologists significantly improved the positive predictive value for detection of clinically significant prostate cancer and showed a trend towards improved NPV for MRI-negative cases where biopsy could be safely avoided.

We used transcriptomic data to estimate the Cell Cycle Progression Score (CCPS, Prolaris), the Genomic Classifier Score (GCS, Decipher) and the Genomic Prostate Score (GPS, OncotypeDx), SChLaP1 expression, and copy number alteration percentage (%CNA) as well as hallmark gene set enrichment analysis.  Results:   Tumor size and gene expression data was available for 267 men. On multivariable regression adjusted for Gleason Grade Group and tumor purity, tumor size was independently associated with the calculated (c)GCS, cGPS, SChLaP1 expression, and %CNA (P< 0.05), but not cCCPS. Gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated that tumors <5 cc, when adjusting for Gleason grade group, were enriched for androgen response genes, while tumors >5 cc were enriched for MYC targets and genes associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition.

Compared to men of a healthy weight, overweight and obese men are more likely to have CaP recurrence post-prostatectomy. Obesity is related to inflammation and immune dysregulation; thus, weight loss may be an avenue to reduce inflammation and reverse these immune processes.  Objectives:   This study explores the reversibility of the biological mechanisms through intentional weight loss using a comprehensive weight management program in men undergoing prostatectomy. Outcomes include blood and tissue biomarkers, microtumor environment gene expression, inflammation markers and Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) scores.  Methods:   Twenty overweight men undergoing prostatectomy participated in this study. Fifteen men chose the intervention and 5 men chose the nonintervention group. The intervention consisted of a comprehensive weight loss program prior to prostatectomy and a weight maintenance program following surgery. Prostate tissue samples were obtained from diagnostic biopsies before the intervention and prostatectomy samples after weight loss. Blood samples and diet records were collected at baseline, pre-surgery after weight loss and at study end after weight maintenance. Immunohistochemistry and NanoString analysis were used to analyze the tissue samples. Flow cytometry was used to assess circulating immune markers. Inflammation markers were measured using Luminex panels.  Results:   The intervention group lost >5% body weight prior to surgery. DII scores improved during the weight loss intervention from baseline to pre-surgery (P = 0.002); and between group differences were significant (P = 0.02). DII scores were not associated with IL-6 nor hsCRP. In the intervention, CXCL12, CXCR7, and CXCR4 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand/receptor) and Ki67 expression decreased in the prostate tissue from biopsy to surgery (P = 0.06), yet plasma CXCL12 increased during the same timeframe (P = 0.009). The downregulation of several genes (FDR<0.001) was observed in the intervention compared to the non-intervention. Changes in immune cells were not significant in either group.  Conclusion:   This feasibility study demonstrates that in overweight men with localized CaP, weight loss alters blood, and tissue biomarkers, as well as tumor gene expression.

To this regard, protein kinases regulates a number of critical cellular pathways by adding phosphate groups to specific substrates. For this reason, their involvement in the complex interactions between the human microbiota and cancer cells to determine therapy and tumor progression outcome is becoming increasingly relevant. Mycoplasmas are components of the normal human microbiota, and several species have also been associated to human diseases, including certain cancers. It is also important to note that Mycoplasmas and their proteins are a component of the common tumor microenvironment. In addition, several epidemiological, in vivo and in vitro studies indicate a close involvement of Mycoplasmas in cellular transformation and cancer progression.  Methods:   In this study, we investigate the effect of exogenous Mycoplasma DnaK on kinases activity by treating in vitro four different eukaryotic cancer cell lines, namely lung and prostate cancer, colon adenocarcinoma, and neuroblastoma. Phosphorylation of kinases and specific substrates was measured at 20 and 60 min.  Results:   Kinome analysis of our data indicates that Mycoplasma DnaK promotes the dysregulation of the activity of specific kinases and their substrates, with a known involvement in carcinogenesis and cancer progression.

We developed a framework for projecting overall (de novo and progressive) metastases prevented in a screening trial using prostate cancer screening as a case study.  Methods:   Mechanistic simulation model in which screening shifts a fraction of cases that would be metastatic at diagnosis to being non-metastatic. This shift increases the incidence of non-overdiagnosed, organ-confined cases. We use estimates of the risk of metastatic progression for these cases to project how many progress to metastasis after diagnosis and tally the projected de novo and progressive metastatic cases with and without screening. We use data on stage shift from the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) and data on the risk of metastatic progression from the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group-4 trial. We estimate the relative risk and absolute risk reductions in metastatic disease at diagnosis and compare these with reductions in overall metastases.  Results:   Assuming no effect of screening beyond initial stage shift at diagnosis, the model projects a 43% reduction in metastasis at diagnosis but a 22% reduction in the cumulative probability of metastasis over 12 years in favor of screening. These results are consistent with the empirical findings from the ERSPC.

These numbers suggest that recent trends in deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis could play an important role, serving as screening methods for PCa detection. These algorithms have already been used with histopathological images in many works, in which authors tend to focus on achieving high accuracy results for classifying between malignant and normal cases. These results are commonly obtained by training very deep and complex convolutional neural networks, which require high computing power and resources not only in this process, but also in the inference step. As the number of cases rises in regions with limited resources, reducing prediction time becomes more important. In this work, we measured the performance of current state-of-the-art models for PCa detection with a novel benchmark and compared the results with PROMETEO, a custom architecture that we proposed.

To investigate whether auto-reactive and allo-reactive T-cell repertoires encoded distinct properties, we used dextramer enumeration, enrichment, single-cell T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing and multiparameter analysis. We found auto-reactive and allo-reactive T-cells differed in mean ex vivo frequency which was antigen dependent. Allo-reactive T-cells showed clear differences in TCR architecture, with enriched usage of specific T-cell receptor variable (TRBJ) genes and broader use of T-cell receptor variable joining (TRBJ) genes. Auto-reactive T-cell repertoires exhibited complementary determining regions three (CDR3) lengths using a Gaussian distribution whereas allo-reactive T-cell repertoires exhibited distorted patterns in CDR3 length. CDR3 loops from allo-reactive T-cells showed distinct physical-chemical properties, tending to encode loops that were more acidic in charge. Allo-reactive T-cell repertoires differed in diversity metrics, tending to show increased overall diversity and increased homogeneity between repertoires. Motif analysis of CDR3 loops showed allo-reactive T-cell repertoires differed in motif preference which included broader motif use. Collectively, these data conclude that allo-reactive T-cell repertoires are indeed different to auto-reactive repertoires and provide tangible metrics for further investigations and validation.

Using complementary biological and molecular approaches, we determined the associated underlying mechanisms in pre-clinical androgen-sensitive PC models. ARATs increased androgren receptors (ARs) in LNCaP and AR/ARv7 (AR variant) in VCaP cells, inhibited cell proliferation in both, and induced poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) cleavage and death in VCaP but not LNCaP cells. Metformin decreased AR and ARv7 expression and induced cleaved PARP-1-associated death in both cell lines. Metformin with abiraterone or enzalutamide decreased AR and ARv7 expression showed greater inhibition of cell proliferation and greater induction of cell death than single agent treatments. Combination treatments led to increased cleaved PARP-1 and enhanced PARP-1 activity manifested by increases in poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) and nuclear accumulation of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF). Enhanced annexin V staining occurred in LNCaP cells only with metformin/ARAT combinations, but no caspase 3 recruitment occurred in either cell line. Finally, metformin and metformin/ARAT combinations increased lysosomal permeability resulting in cathepsin G-mediated PARP-1 cleavage and cell death.

Steroid pulse therapy was initiated and his symptoms, including opsoclonus and ataxia, markedly improved. Although most cases of paraneoplastic opsoclonus precede the discovery of cancer, our case developed symptoms simultaneously with relapse and acute progression of prostate cancer. Paraneoplastic opsoclonus with prostate cancer is rare. Additionally, our case showed excellent response of opsoclonus to steroid therapy without treatment of the underlying disease.

The purpose of this work was to evaluate uniformly the impact of surgical facility volume on survival in patients with cancer.  Methods:   The National Cancer Database was searched for patients diagnosed in 2004 through 2013 with the 12 cancers most commonly treated surgically. Facilities were stratified by 4 categories using the overall population (low, intermediate, high, and very high), each including 25% of patients, and then stratified by each individual disease site. Five-year postsurgery survival was estimated using both the Kaplan-Meier method and corresponding log-rank tests for group comparisons. Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the effects of facility volume on 5-year postsurgery survival further, adjusted for multiple covariates.  Results:   A total of 3,923,618 patients who underwent surgery were included from 1,139 facilities. Of these, 40.4% had breast cancer, 12.8% prostate cancer, and 10.0% colon cancer. Most patients were female (65.0%), White (86.4%), and privately insured (51.6%) with stage 0-III disease (64.8%). For all cancers, the risk of death for patients undergoing surgery at very high-volume facilities was 88% of that for those treated at low-volume facilities. Hazard ratios (HRs) were greatest (very high vs low volume) for cancer of the prostate (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.63-0.69), pancreas (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.71-0.78), and esophagus (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.73-0.83), and for melanoma (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.78-0.84); differences were smallest for uterine and non-small cell lung cancers. Overall survival differences were greatest for cancers of the brain, pancreas, and esophagus.  Conclusions:   Patients treated surgically at higher-volume facilities consistently had improved overall survival compared with those treated at low-volume centers, although the magnitude of difference was cancer-specific.""","""['Kelsey C Stoltzfus', 'Biyi Shen', 'Leila Tchelebi', 'Daniel M Trifiletti', 'Niraj J Gusani', 'Vonn Walter', 'Ming Wang', 'Nicholas G Zaorsky']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Natl Compr Canc Netw""","""[""Authors' Reply: To the Letter to the Editor by Kessel et al."", 'Letter to the Editor: What Hides Beyond the Numbers: Statistics or Real Practice?', 'Is Treatment at a High-volume Center Associated with an Improved Survival for Primary Malignant Bone Tumors?', 'Impact of radiation therapy facility volume on survival in patients with cancer.', 'Soft Tissue Sarcoma of the Extremities: What Is the Value of Treating at High-volume Centers?', 'The Impact of Academic Facility Type and Case Volume on Survival in Patients Undergoing Curative Radiation Therapy for Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer.', 'Analysis of Radiation Facility Volume and Survival in Men With Lymph Node-Positive Prostate Cancer Treated With Radiation and Androgen Deprivation Therapy.', 'Hospital volume and prognosis of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer: A study using the Osaka Cancer Registry.', 'Medical Service Use and Charges for Cancer Care in 2018 for Privately Insured Patients Younger Than 65 Years in the US.']"""

The objective of this study was to determine whether CRF is associated with prostate cancer screening, incidence, or mortality.  Methods:   The Henry Ford Exercise Testing Project is a retrospective cohort study of men aged 40 to 70 years without cancer who underwent physician-referred exercise stress testing from 1995 to 2009. CRF was quantified in metabolic equivalents of task (METs) (<6 [reference], 6-9, 10-11, and ≥12 METs), estimated from the peak workload achieved during a symptom-limited, maximal exercise stress test. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, incident prostate cancer, and all-cause mortality were analyzed with multivariable adjusted Poisson regression and Cox proportional hazard models.  Results:   In total, 22,827 men were included, of whom 739 developed prostate cancer, with a median follow-up of 7.5 years. Men who had high fitness (≥12 METs) had an 28% higher risk of PSA screening (95% CI, 1.2-1.3) compared with those who had low fitness (<6 METs. After adjusting for PSA screening, fitness was associated with higher prostate cancer incidence (men aged <55 years, P = .02; men aged >55 years, P ≤ .01), but not with advanced prostate cancer. Among the men who were diagnosed with prostate cancer, high fitness was associated with a 60% lower risk of all-cause mortality (95% CI, 0.2-0.9).  Conclusions:   Although men with high fitness are more likely to undergo PSA screening, this does not fully account for the increased incidence of prostate cancer seen among these individuals. However, men with high fitness have a lower risk of death after a prostate cancer diagnosis, suggesting that the cancers identified may be low-risk with little impact on long-term outcomes.""","""['Cara Reiter-Brennan', 'Omar Dzaye', 'Mouaz H Al-Mallah', 'Zeina Dardari', 'Clinton A Brawner', 'Lois E Lamerato', 'Steven J Keteyian', 'Jonathan K Ehrman', 'Michael J Blaha', 'Kala Visvanathan', 'Catherine H Marshall']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Cardiorespiratory fitness and incident lung and colorectal cancer in men and women: Results from the Henry Ford Exercise Testing (FIT) cohort.', 'Midlife Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Incident Cancer, and Survival After Cancer in Men: The Cooper Center Longitudinal Study.', 'Cardiorespiratory fitness and incident heart failure: The Henry Ford ExercIse Testing (FIT) Project.', 'Cardiorespiratory fitness is not associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer: A cohort study and review of the literature.', 'Screening for prostate cancer.', 'Association Between Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Cancer Incidence and Cancer-Specific Mortality of Colon, Lung, and Prostate Cancer Among Swedish Men.', 'Prostate Cancer Incidence and Mortality: Global Status and Temporal Trends in 89 Countries From 2000 to 2019.', 'Healthy Lifestyle Benefits Both Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease: More Bang for the Buck.']"""

Methods:   A six-tier integrated dual tracer PET-CT (68Ga-PSMA and FDG) Image Scoring System ('Pro-PET' score) was conceptualized, based on the findings of both 68Ga-PSMA-11 and FDG PET-CT in patients of mCRPC. This proposed integrated scoring was examined in a retrospective analytical study assessing mCRPC patients (n = 47) referred for 177Lu-PSMA-617 peptide receptor radioligand therapy (PRLT) and had both FDG and 68Ga-PSMA PET-CT undertaken within 15 days of each other without any interim treatment intervention. The 'Pro-PET' score grades and subgrades were assigned and compared with clinical data, such as histopathology, Gleason score, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), treatment response (symptomatic, biochemical, metabolic and anatomical) and survival [overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS)].  Results:   The Pro-PET score significantly correlated with symptomatic (P = 0.05), biochemical (P = 0.05), metabolic (P = 0.001) and anatomical (P = 0.012) responses, PFS (P = 0.03) and OS (P = 0.027). On multivariate analysis, histopathology, Gleason score and PSA as individual parameters were not significantly associated with OS and PFS, whereas the Pro-PET score was found to have a significant association (P = 0.001 for PFS and 0.011 for OS).

Patients with pyuria (>100 white blood cells/ml) and a preoperative indwelling catheter were excluded. Postoperative fever was defined as a body temperature ≥38.3C. A noninferiority design was used with a 6% noninferiority margin and null hypothesis (H0) that the infection risk is at least 6% higher in the experimental (E) than in the control (C) group; H0: C (antimicrobial prophylaxis group) - E (no antimicrobial prophylaxis group) ≥ Δ (6% noninferiority margin). A multivariable, logistic regression was performed regarding posttransurethral resection of the prostate fever and antimicrobial prophylaxis with co-variates: (clot-)retention and operating time.

Increased phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 factor which is induced in response to IL-6 is one of the typical features of prostate cancer. However, reports in the literature show regulation of neuroendocrine phenotype by IL-6. Effects of IL-6 on stimulation of proliferation, migration, and invasion lead to the establishment of experimental and clinical approaches to target IL-6. In prostate cancer, anti-IL-6 antibodies were demonstrated to inhibit growth in vitro and in vivo. Clinically, application of anti-IL-6 therapies did not improve survival of patients with metastatic prostate cancer. However, clinical trial design in the future may include different treatment schedule and combinations with experimental and clinical therapies.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed our cryosurgery database between July 2003 and September 2019 for men who were treated with individualized partial gland cryoablation of the prostate at our tertiary care center. Baseline and periodic urinary and sexual function surveys were administered throughout the post-treatment period. Results: A total of 82 men were included in the study. Median follow-up was 28 months (interquartile range: 10.5-59.3 months). A total of 71 men underwent primary individualized partial gland cryoablation, whereas 11 men underwent salvage partial gland ablation. Failure-free survival at 1 to 5 years was 98%, 89%, 84%, 75%, and 75% in the primary therapy group, and 100%, 80%, and 40% in the salvage group at 1 to 3 years, respectively. In the primary therapy group, all 71 patients remained free of pads at 3 months and throughout the follow-up period. Men who had undergone primary focal cryoablation had a higher post-treatment International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) score, followed by men treated with primary hemi-cryoablation and primary subtotal cryoablation. The American Urological Association (AUA) symptom scores decreased regardless of the type of partial gland ablation performed, with subtotal ablation having the lowest score compared with hemiablation and focal cryoablation. No patient developed a fistula in the primary group, and 1 (9%) patient developed a fistula in the salvage group.

In the management of prostate cancer, diagnostic biopsy specimens are important sources of data that inform the selection of treatment. B7-H3 (CD276), an immune checkpoint molecule, has emerged as a promising immunotherapy target. B7-H3 expression is related to adverse clinical outcomes in various types of cancer; however, little is known concerning the association between tumor B7-H3 expression in diagnostic biopsy specimens and clinical outcome in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.  Methods:   We evaluated tumor B7-H3 expression levels in diagnostic biopsy specimens from 135 patients with metastatic prostate cancer and 113 patients with localized prostate cancer.  Results:   High B7-H3 expression was more frequently observed in patients with metastatic cancer than in those with localized cancer (31 vs. 12%; p = 0.0003). In patients with localized cancer, the B7-H3 expression status was not associated with biochemical recurrence-free survival. However, among patients with metastatic cancer, high B7-H3 expression was independently associated with high disease-specific mortality (multivariable hazard ratio [HR] = 2.72; p = 0.047) and overall mortality rates (multivariable HR = 2.04; p = 0.025).  Conclusions:   Tumor B7-H3 expression in diagnostic biopsy specimens may be a useful biomarker for identifying highly aggressive metastatic prostate cancer.

Materials and methods:   A randomized pilot study of patients assigned to either cryotherapy alone (Control group) or in combination with GMCSF (Treatment group). The impact of therapy on the development of T- and B-cell responses against tumor-related antigens was studied using enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot (ELISpot) and protein microarray panels (Sematrix) assays, respectively. Fold changes in response to treatment were calculated by normalization of post-treatment ELISpot values against the mean pre-cryoablation response. Student t tests between treatment and control groups at 4 weeks and 12 weeks across all the antigens were performed.  Results:   A total of 20 patients were randomized to either control or treatment arm. At 4 weeks after cryotherapy, the treatment group demonstrated an average fold change in cancer antigen-related antibodies of 2.8% above their mean baseline values, whereas controls averaged an 18% change below mean baseline (p < 0.05). At 12 weeks, antibody response in treatment group increased to 25% above baseline, while the average of control group patients remained 9% below baseline (p < 0.05). Patients in treatment group displayed, on average, higher ELISPOT readings for the 4- and 12-week times points (527 vs 481 for PSA and 748 vs 562 for PAP).  Conclusions:   GMCSF appeared to broadly elevate antibodies against prostate-specific and nonspecific antigens. Prostate antigen-specific T-cell responses were more enhanced over non-prostate-specific responses, preferentially in the treatment group.

Patients and methods:   135 prostate cancer patients aged 43-90 years on ADT were randomized to twice weekly supervised impact loading and resistance exercise (ImpRes), supervised aerobic and resistance exercise (AerRes), and usual care/delayed supervised aerobic exercise (DelAer) for 12 months, and completed measures of psychological distress using the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18). BSI-18 provides three subscales for anxiety, depression, and somatisation, as well as the global severity index (GSI) where higher scores indicate higher distress.  Results:   Following the intervention, somatization was not different to baseline, however, there were significant interactions (p < 0.01) for depression, anxiety, and the GSI. In ImpRes, depression was reduced at 12 months compared to baseline and 6 months (0.78 ± 1.39 vs. 1.88 ± 3.24 and 1.48 ± 2.65, p < 0.001), as was the GSI (3.67 ± 4.34 vs. 5.94 ± 7.46 and 4.64 ± 4.73, p < 0.001) with anxiety reduced compared to baseline (1.08 ± 1.54 vs. 1.98 ± 2.56).

We compared follow-up appointments, adherence, and clinical outcomes among African/Afro-Caribbean men on AS at a high-volume UK hospital with other ethnicities.  Methods:   Men with confirmed low-intermediate risk Pca who attended the AS clinic (2005-2016) and had undergone ≥1 follow-up biopsy (n = 458) were included. Non-adherence (defined as >20% missed appointments), suspicion of disease progression (any upgrading, >30% positive cores, cT-stage > 3, PIRADS > 3), any upgrading from diagnostic biopsy and conversion to active treatment (prostatectomy, radiotherapy or hormone therapy) according to ethnicity (African/Afro-Caribbean versus other ethnicities) were assessed using multivariable regression analysis.  Results:   Twenty-three percent of eligible men were recorded as African/Afro-Caribbean, while the remainder were predominantly Caucasian. African/Afro-Caribbean men had slightly lower PSA at diagnosis (median 5.0 vs. 6.0 ng/mL) and more positive cores at diagnosis (median 2 vs. 1). They had a substantially higher rate of non-attendance at scheduled follow-up visits (24% vs. 10%, p < 0.001). Adjusted analyses suggest African/Afro-Caribbean men may be at increased risk of disease progression (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.38; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.99-1.91, P = 0.054) and upgrading (HR: 1.29; 95% CI 0.87-1.92, P = 0.305), though neither reached statistical significance. No difference in risk of conversion to treatment was observed between ethnic groups (HR: 1.03; 95% CI 0.64-1.47, P = 0.873).  Conclusions:   African/Afro-Caribbean men on AS for PCa in the UK are less likely to adhere to scheduled appointments, suggesting a more tailored service addressing their specific needs may be required. While African/Afro-Caribbean men were no more likely to convert to treatment than Caucasian/other men, findings of a potentially higher risk of disease progression signal the need for careful selection and monitoring of African/Afro-Caribbean men on AS.

The efficacy of several repurposed drugs has been evaluated in clinical trials. Among these drugs, a second-generation antiandrogen agent, enzalutamide, was proposed because it reduces the expression of transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), a key component mediating SARS-CoV-2-driven entry, in prostate cancer cells. However, definitive evidence for the therapeutic efficacy of enzalutamide in COVID-19 is lacking. Here, we evaluated the antiviral efficacy of enzalutamide in prostate cancer cells, lung cancer cells, human lung organoids and Ad-ACE2-transduced mice. Tmprss2 knockout significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Enzalutamide effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in human prostate cells, however, such antiviral efficacy was lacking in human lung cells and organoids. Accordingly, enzalutamide showed no antiviral activity due to the AR-independent TMPRSS2 expression in mouse and human lung epithelial cells.

We hypothesized CGP of cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) could offer a minimally invasive alternative to detect targetable genomic alterations (GA) that inform clinical care.  Experimental design:   Using plasma from 3,334 patients with mCRPC (including 1,674 screening samples from TRITON2/3), we evaluated the landscape of GAs detected in ctDNA and assessed concordance with tissue-based CGP.  Results:   A total of 3,129 patients (94%) had detectable ctDNA with a median ctDNA fraction of 7.5%; BRCA1/2 was mutated in 295 (8.8%). In concordance analysis, 72 of 837 patients had BRCA1/2 mutations detected in tissue, 67 (93%) of which were also identified using ctDNA, including 100% of predicted germline variants. ctDNA harbored some BRCA1/2 alterations not identified by tissue testing, and ctDNA was enriched in therapy resistance alterations, as well as possible clonal hematopoiesis mutations (e.g., in ATM and CHEK2). Potential androgen receptor resistance alterations were detected in 940 of 2,213 patients (42%), including amplifications, polyclonal and compound mutations, rearrangements, and novel deletions in exon 8.  Conclusions:   Genomic analysis of ctDNA from patients with mCRPC recapitulates the genomic landscape detected in tissue biopsies, with a high level of agreement in detection of BRCA1/2 mutations, but more acquired resistance alterations detected in ctDNA.

Methods:   Observational, cross-sectional study conducted at the Departments of Urology of 38 Spanish hospitals. The study included 188 patients diagnosed with nmCRPC who underwent an imaging test for the assessment of metástasis. In one study visit, physicians were requested to specify the clinical factors that led them to perform these tests. The results of the imaging tests and the clinical characteristics of the patients since the time of prostate cancer (PC) diagnosis, were reported. Regression analyses were used to determine predictors of imaging test results.  Results:   Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was the most important driver to order imaging tests (57.1%), followed by regular follow-up (16.5%) and PSA doubling time (PSADT) (12.0%). Although these drivers were not associated to detection of metastasis, patients with PSA levels ≥20 ng/mL had a greater risk of metastasis than patients with PSA levels <4ng/mL (P=.004) and CRPC patients diagnosed with metastasis (mCRPC) had higher median PSA levels (20.9; interquartile range [IQR]: 6.7-38.6) than nmCRPC (9.1; IQR: 5.0-18.0) (P=.005). Sixty-six percent of the patients did not undergo any imaging test after CRPC diagnosis until the study visit (10.6, IQR: 4.0-19.5 months).

Objective:   This study aimed to investigate the effects of SiO2-NPs and their derivatives, including SiNP-NH2, SiNP-Cl, and SiNP-SH against PCa and clarify their molecular mechanism on cell death, gene, and protein expressions.  Methods:   Following the synthesis and derivation of SiO2-NPs, their characterization was carried out using TEM, DLS, BET, and FT-IR. Cytotoxic properties of the compounds were investigated against different human cancerous cells; including HUH-7, A549, DLD-1, HeLa, NCI-H295R, and PC-3, as well as human healthy epithelium cell line PNT1A.  Results:   SiNP-NH2, SiNP-Cl, and SiNP-SH dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of PC-3 cells with an IC50 value as 55.46 μg/mL, 55.09 μg/mL and 72.89 μg/mL, respectively. SiNP-SH significantly(p<0.0001) inhibited metastasis and invasion of PC-3 cells(20.4% and 46.7%, respectively), and significantly(p<0.0001) increased early apoptosis(32.3%) when compared with non-treated cells.

Depletion of TPX2 can significantly inhibit cell activity and migration, and in vivo experiments show that knockdown of TPX2 can significantly inhibit tumor growth.

At the RNA level, AR-V7 upregulation is generally coupled with increased full-length AR (AR-FL); consequently, AR-V7 and AR-Vs collectively constitute a minority of the AR population. However, Western blotting showed that the relative abundance of AR-V proteins is much higher in many castration-resistant prostate cancers (CRPCs). To address the mechanism underlying this discrepancy, we analyzed RNA-seq data from ~350 CRPC samples and found a positive correlation between all canonical and alternative AR splicing. This indicates that increased alternative splicing is not at the expense of canonical splicing. Instead, androgen deprivation releases AR-FL from repressing the transcription of the AR gene to induce coordinated increase of AR-FL and AR-V mRNAs. At the protein level, however, androgen deprivation induces AR-FL, but not AR-V, degradation. Moreover, AR-V7 is translated much faster than AR-FL. Thus, androgen-deprivation-induced AR-gene transcription and AR-FL protein decay, together with efficient AR-V7 translation, explain the discrepancy between the relative AR-V mRNA and protein abundances in many CRPCs, highlighting the inevitability of AR-V induction after endocrine therapy.""","""['Tianfang Ma', 'Shanshan Bai', 'Yanfeng Qi', 'Yang Zhan', 'Nathan Ungerleider', 'Derek Y Zhang', 'Taavi Neklesa', 'Eva Corey', 'Scott M Dehm', 'Kun Zhang', 'Erik K Flemington', 'Yan Dong']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""['Rapid induction of androgen receptor splice variants by androgen deprivation in prostate cancer.', 'Growth Inhibition by Testosterone in an Androgen Receptor Splice Variant-Driven Prostate Cancer Model.', 'Distinct transcriptional programs mediated by the ligand-dependent full-length androgen receptor and its splice variants in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Role of androgen receptor splice variants, their clinical relevance and treatment options.', 'ARV-7: A biomarker for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Emergent dynamics of underlying regulatory network links EMT and androgen receptor-dependent resistance in prostate cancer.', 'AR and PI3K/AKT in Prostate Cancer: A Tale of Two Interconnected Pathways.', 'Inhibiting androgen receptor splice variants with cysteine-selective irreversible covalent inhibitors to treat prostate cancer.', 'AR Structural Variants and Prostate Cancer.', 'A narrative review of the role of glucocorticoid receptors in prostate cancer: developments in last 5 years.']"""

This biocompatible nanocopolymer self-assembles in a pH-dependent manner, providing stimuli responsiveness, active targeting, and extended release of hydrophobic chemotherapeutic agents and effectively penetrates the inner core of 3-dimensional cancer spheroid models. The empty FA-DABA-SMA decreased tumor spheroid volume, revealing a previously unknown mechanism of action. Here, we investigated the potential mechanism of the small (20 kDa) and large (350 kDa) FA-DABA-SMA empty copolymers affecting the folic acid receptor alpha (FRα) signaling properties in breast and prostate cancer cell lines. Microscopic imaging, immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, Caspase 3/7 apoptosis assays, Incucyte live cell tracking, the scratch wound assay, the water-soluble tetrazolium salt-1 (WST-1) cell viability assay, morphologic changes, and Western blot for the expression levels of FRα on the cell surface were used on MDA MB-231 and MCF-7 breast and DU-145 prostate cancer cell lines. The findings indicate that FA-DABA-SMA increases FRα expression levels in breast MDA MB-231 cancer cells and then disrupts FR signaling by reducing HES1 and NOTCH1 protein expression levels. Also, FA-DABA-SMA induces apoptosis and further causes a change in the MDA MB-231 cells' morphology and significantly reduces their ability to migrate in a scratch wound assay. Collectively, these findings provide a novel insight into the functionalized FA-DABA-SMA copolymer. The 350 and 20 kDa copolymers actively target FRα to initialize internationalization. However, only the large size and sheet-shaped 350 kDa copolymers disrupt FRα signaling. The significance of these novel findings reveals that the copolymer's intracellular activity is critically dependent on the size and structural shape.

This study aimed to investigate the expression and function of circANKS1B in prostate cancer (PC).  Methods:   The expression of circANKS1B and miR-152-3p was analyzed by real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell migration and invasion were measured using a transwell assay. The interaction between circANKS1B and miR-152-3p was confirmed by a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Rescue experiments were conducted to determine whether circANKS1B regulated the invasion of PC cells via the circANKS1B-miR-152-3p-TGF-α pathway.  Results:   The expression of circANKS1B was markedly upregulated in both PC cells and tissues. Moreover, high circANKS1B expression was associated with poor prognosis in PC patients. Dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that circANKS1B directly bound to miR-152-3p. Furthermore, circANKS1B negatively regulated miR-152-3p expression. Knockdown of circANKS1B markedly suppressed cell migration and invasion and TGF-α expression in PC cells, whereas the effects of circANKS1B silencing were reversed by miR-152-3p deficiency. In addition, the impact of miR-152-3p silencing on invasion of circANKS1B-deficient PC cells was also abrogated by TGF-α deficiency. Overall, circANKS1B acts as a sponge for miR-152-3p to promote PC progression by upregulating TGF-α expression.

Amongst many, the principle routes of desensitization include a) activation of survival pathways (e.g. NF-kB, PARP) and b) downregulation of cell death pathways (e.g. CD95/CD95L). As a result, it requires high therapeutic dose to achieve tumor regression which, in turn damages normal cells through the collateral effects. Methods are needed to sensitize the low and non-responsive resistant tumor cells including cancer stem cells (CSCs) in order to evoke a better response from the current treatments. Current treatments including chemotherapy can induce cell death only in bulk cancer cells sparing CSCs and cancer resistant cells (CRCs) which are shown to be responsible for high recurrence of disease and low patient survival. Here, we report several novel tumor targeted sensitizers derived from the natural Vitamin E analogue (AMP-001-003).

MATERIAL AND METHODS Data from 181 patients whose PSA levels were in the gray area were retrospectively analyzed, and the following data were collected: age, digital rectal examination, total PSA, PSA density (PSAD), free/total PSA (f/t PSA), transrectal ultrasound, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), and pathological reports. Patients were diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and PCa by pathology reports, and PCa patients were separated into non-clinically significant PCa (NCS-PCa) and CS-PCa by Gleason score. Afterward, predictor models constructed by above parameters were researched to diagnose PCa and CS-PCa, respectively. RESULTS According to the analysis of included clinical data, there were 109 patients with BPH, 44 patients with NCS-PCa, and 28 patients with CS-PCa. Regression analysis showed PCa was correlated with f/t PSA, PSAD, and mpMRI (P<0.01), and CS-PCa was correlated with PSAD and mpMRI (P<0.01). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 2 models for PCa (sensitivity=73.64%, specificity=64.23%) and for CS-PCa (sensitivity=71.41%, specificity=81.82%) were 0.79 and 0.87, respectively.

This report aims to design and develop a novel NIR-nanoprobe, and evaluate its potential in the penetration of PCa tumour tissues. The PSMA receptor-targeted quantum dot (PSMA-QD655) is a NIR, deep-tissue imaging agent, which has the potential for intraoperative navigation during surgery and improved detection specificity for PCa. The probe was designed and synthesized by conjugating functionalized amino-PEG quantum dots (QDs) through a heterobifunctional linker to a DUPA targeted polypeptide construct. The nanoprobe was evaluated in vitro in PSMA+ PCa cell lines for specificity and its binding affinity was determined by flow cytometric analysis. The penetration efficacy was tested further on large PCa 3D tumour spheroids (dia ∼1200 μm, thickness ∼450 μm) by deep tissue multiphoton imaging. PSMA-QD655 was found to be an efficient deep tissue intra-operative guided surgical tool with a high affinity (KD = 15.3 nM) and penetrative capacity. The results have been demonstrated in vitro in 2D and 3D tissue models, mimicking cancer lesions in vivo. In summary, we have developed a deep-tissue imaging NIR nanoprobe targeting prostatic lesions that (i) binds to PSMA+ tumour with sub-nanomolar affinity and high specificity, (ii) shows an excellent safety profile in primary cell lines in vitro and (iii) shows high penetrative capacity in a 3D prostate tumour model (∼450 μm tissue depth).""","""['Mena Asha Krishnan', 'Kratika Yadav', 'Paul Roach', 'Venkatesh Chelvam']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Biomater Sci""","""['Evaluation of Novel Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Targeted Near-Infrared Imaging Agent for Fluorescence-Guided Surgery of Prostate Cancer.', 'PSMA-targeted NIR probes for image-guided detection of prostate cancer.', 'A Novel PSMA-Targeted Probe for NIRF-Guided Surgery and Photodynamic Therapy: Synthesis and Preclinical Validation.', 'New aspects of molecular imaging in prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen for prostate cancer theranostics: from imaging to targeted therapy.', 'Preparation and in vivo imaging of NIR-emissive carbonized polymer dots derived from biomass olive leaves with a quantum yield of 71.4.', 'Membrane dual-targeting probes: A promising strategy for fluorescence-guided prostate cancer surgery and lymph node metastases detection.', 'Current applications of nanomaterials in urinary system tumors.', 'Affinity probes based on small-molecule inhibitors for tumor imaging.', 'Quantum Dots Mediated Imaging and Phototherapy in Cancer Spheroid Models: State of the Art and Perspectives.']"""

However, host-versus-graft reactivity can limit the durability and efficacy of OTS cell therapies requiring new strategies to evade adaptive and innate-immune responses. Human herpes virus-8 (HHV8) maintains infection, in part, by evading host T and natural killer (NK) cell attack. The viral K3 gene encodes a membrane-tethered E3 ubiquitin ligase that discretely targets major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I components, whereas K5 encodes a similar E3 ligase with broader specificity, including MHC-II and the MHC-like MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MIC-A)- and sequence B (MIC-B)-activating ligands of NK cells. We created γ-retroviruses encoding K3 and/or K5 transgenes that efficiently transduce primary human T cells. Expression of K3 or K5 resulted in dramatic downregulation of MHC-IA (human leukocyte antigen [HLA]-A, -B, and -C) and MHC class II (HLA-DR) cell-surface expression. K3 expression was sufficient for T cells to resist exogenously loaded peptide-MHC-specific cytotoxicity, as well as recognition in one-way allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reactions. Further, in immunodeficient mice engrafted with allogeneic T cells, K3-transduced T cells selectively expanded in vivo. Ectopic K5 expression in MHC class I-, MIC-A+/B+ K562 cells also reduced targeting by primary NK cells. Coexpression of K3 in prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA)-directed, inducible MyD88/CD40 (iMC)-enhanced CAR-T cells did not impact cytotoxicity, T cell growth, or cytokine production against HPAC pancreatic tumor target cells, whereas K5-expressing cells showed a modest reduction in interleukin (IL)-2 production without effect on cytotoxicity. Together, these results support application of these E3 ligases to advance development of OTS CAR-T cell products.""","""['Xiaomei Wang', 'Fabricio G Cabrera', 'Kelly L Sharp', 'David M Spencer', 'Aaron E Foster', 'J Henri Bayle']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Mol Ther""","""[""Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus K3 and K5 ubiquitin E3 ligases have stage-specific immune evasion roles during lytic replication."", 'Off-the-shelf Vδ1 gamma delta T cells engineered with glypican-3 (GPC-3)-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and soluble IL-15 display robust antitumor efficacy against hepatocellular carcinoma.', ""Natural killer cell evasion by an E3 ubiquitin ligase from Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus."", ""Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ubiquitin ligases downregulate cell surface expression of l-selectin."", 'The trafficking and regulation of membrane receptors by the RING-CH ubiquitin E3 ligases.', 'Harnessing novel strategies and cell types to overcome immune tolerance during adoptive cell therapy in cancer.', 'Endowing universal CAR T-cell with immune-evasive properties using TALEN-gene editing.', 'Reprogramming the tumor microenvironment by genome editing for precision cancer therapy.', 'Incorporation of bacterial immunoevasins to protect cell therapies from host antibody-mediated immune rejection.', 'Current Perspectives on the Use of off the Shelf CAR-T/NK Cells for the Treatment of Cancer.']"""

Darolutamide is currently available as an oral treatment for adults with nmCRPC. The ARAMIS trial looked at darolutamide taken by mouth in 1509 participants from 36 countries with nmCRPC (prostate cancer that has not spread to other parts of the body and no longer responds adequately to initial hormone therapy). The trial showed that darolutamide in addition to hormone therapy increased the length of time that the trial participants were still alive for and lowered the risk of death by 31% compared with placebo (sugar pill) and hormone therapy. The participants who received darolutamide and hormone therapy also had longer time to worsening pain, needing chemotherapy, and having cancer-related bone fractures or symptoms related to cancer-related bone fractures compared with those who received placebo and hormone therapy during the trial. In general, the percentage of participants who experienced medical problems (referred to as adverse events) was similar between those who received darolutamide and those who received placebo, in addition to hormone therapy.

PDA indolylmaleimides showed anticancer effects in several neoplastic cell lines. Herein, a comparative characterization of PDA-66 and PDA-377 mediated effects was performed in human and canine PCa cell lines, which is also the first detailed characterization of these agents on cells derived from solid tumors in general. While PDA-377 showed only weak growth inhibition on human PCa cell lines, PDA-66 inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in human and canine cell lines with concentrations in the low micromolar range.

We examined the most recent trends in population-based cancer incidence and mortality in Japan.  Methods:   National cancer mortality data between 1958 and 2018 were obtained from published vital statistics. Cancer incidence data between 1985 and 2015 were obtained from high-quality population-based cancer registries maintained by three prefectures (Yamagata, Fukui, and Nagasaki). Trends in age-standardized rates (ASR) were examined using Joinpoint regression analysis.  Results:   For males, all-cancer incidence increased between 1985 and 1996 (annual percent change [APC] +1.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-1.5%), increased again in 2000-2010 (+1.3%; 95% CI, 0.9-1.8%), and then decreased until 2015 (-1.4%; 95% CI, -2.5 to -0.3%). For females, all-cancer incidence increased until 2010 (+0.8%; 95% CI, 0.6-0.9% in 1985-2004 and +2.4%; 95% CI, 1.3-3.4% in 2004-2010), and stabilized thereafter until 2015. The post-2000 increase was mainly attributable to prostate in males and breast in females, which slowed or levelled during the first decade of the 2000s. After a sustained increase, all-cancer mortality for males decreased in 1996-2013 (-1.6%; 95% CI, -1.6 to -1.5%) and accelerated thereafter until 2018 (-2.5%; 95% CI, -2.9 to -2.0%). All-cancer mortality for females decreased intermittently throughout the observation period, with the most recent APC of -1.0% (95% CI, -1.1 to -0.9%) in 2003-2018. The recent decreases in mortality in both sexes, and in incidence in males, were mainly attributable to stomach, liver, and male lung cancers.  Conclusion:   The ASR of all-cancer incidence began decreasing significantly in males and levelled off in females in 2010.""","""['Kota Katanoda', 'Megumi Hori', 'Eiko Saito', 'Akiko Shibata', 'Yuri Ito', 'Tetsuji Minami', 'Sayaka Ikeda', 'Tatsuya Suzuki', 'Tomohiro Matsuda']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Epidemiol""","""['Trend analysis of cancer incidence in Japan using data from selected population-based cancer registries.', 'An updated report of the trends in cancer incidence and mortality in Japan.', 'An updated report on the trends in cancer incidence and mortality in Japan, 1958-2013.', 'Progress in cancer mortality, incidence, and survival: a global overview.', 'Incidence and mortality trends for four major cancers in the elderly and middle-aged adults: an international comparison.', 'Nutritional Status Is Associated With Survival Following Spinal Surgery in Patients With Metastatic Spinal Tumors.', 'Incidence of second primary cancers in oral and pharyngeal cancer patients using a large medical claims database in Japan.', 'Age-Dependent Causes of Death among Patients with Breast Cancer Based on Osaka Cancer Registry and Vital Statistics in Japan.', 'Sciatica Caused by Perineural Spread of Prostate Cancer.', 'Long-Term Risk of Being Bedridden in Elderly Patients Who Underwent Oncologic Surgery: A Retrospective Study Using a Japanese Claims Database.']"""

Surgical techniques aimed at improving earlier return to continence are continuously sought.  Objective:   To describe our novel surgical technique of urethral fixation during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) and to assess early urinary continence recovery and perioperative complications.  Design, setting, and participants:   A prospective, single-center, single-surgeon cohort of 70 consecutive patients undergoing RARP between January and December 2019 was analyzed. A study group of 35 patients operated on with the urethral fixation technique was compared with a control group of 35 patients receiving standard vesicourethral anastomosis.  Surgical procedure:   Urethral fixation versus standard vesicourethral anastomosis during RARP was evaluated. In the study group, the urethral stump was fixed to the dorsal median raphe posteriorly and to the medial portion of the levator ani muscle posterolaterally. The same posterior musculofascial reconstruction incorporating the vesicourethral anastomosis was performed in both groups.  Measurements:   Urinary continence recovery, perioperative complications, operating room time, and estimated blood loss were recorded and compared between the two groups.  Results and limitations:   The two groups were comparable with regard to all demographic, clinical, and pathological variables. Recovery of urinary continence at 3 mo after catheter removal was reported by 34 (97.1%) patients in the study and 28 (80%) patients in the control group (p = 0.02). Patients in the study group reported significantly higher rates of urinary continence even at 1 wk and 1 mo after catheter removal compared with the control group (68.6% vs 45.7%, p = 0.04, and 80% vs 54.3%, p = 0.04, respectively). No differences were observed in operating room time (p = 0.7) or estimated blood loss (p = 0.65). Ninety-day postoperative complications were observed in one (2.9%) patient in the study and in four (11.4%) in the control group (p = 0.3). The main limitation is the nonrandomized comparison of relatively small cohorts.  Conclusions:   In our study, we observed a significant improvement in early urinary continence recovery, with no increase in operating room time or perioperative complications, using the novel urethral fixation technique compared with the standard vesicourethral anastomosis during RARP.  Patient summary:   We describe our novel surgical technique of urethral fixation during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.

Several studies have shown that anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) act as anticancer agents while reducing metastases and mortality rate. NSAIDs are seriously limited by their side effects and toxicity, which can become cumulative with their long-term administration for chemoprevention. In the current ex vivo / in vitro study, the genotoxicity mechanisms of NSAIDS in bulk and nanoparticle forms allowed a strategy to prevent and minimise the damage in human lymphocytes. When compared to their bulk forms, acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) nano and ibuprofen nano (IBU N), both NSAIDs in 500 μg/mL concentration significantly decreased DNA damage measured by alkaline comet assay. Micronuclei (MNi) frequency also decreased after ASP N (500 μg/mL), ASP B (500 μg/mL) and IBU N (200 μg/mL) in prostate cancer patients and healthy individuals, however, the ibuprofen bulk (200 μg/mL) showed a significant increase in MNi formation in lymphocytes from healthy and prostate cancer patients when compared to the respective untreated lymphocytes.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to be important post-transcriptional regulators during tumorigenesis. This study aimed to explore the effect of miR-144 on PCa proliferation and apoptosis.  Material and methods:   The expression of miR-144 and EZH2 were examined in clinical PCa tissues. PCa cell line LNCAP and DU-145 was employed and transfected with miR-144 mimics or inhibitors. The correlation between miR-144 and EZH2 was verified by luciferase reporter assay. Cell viability, apoptosis and migratory capacity were detected by CCK-8, flow cytometry assay and wound healing assay. The protein level of EZH2, E-Cadherin, N-Cadherin and vimentin were analyzed by western blotting.  Results:   miR-144 was found to be negatively correlated to the expression of EZH2 in PCa tissues. Further studies identified EZH2 as a direct target of miR-144. Moreover, overexpression of miR-144 downregulated expression of EZH2, reduced cell viability and promoted cell apoptosis, while knockdown of miR-144 led to an inverse result. miR-144 also suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition level of PCa cells.  Conclusion:   Our study indicated that miR-144 negatively regulate the expression of EZH2 in clinical specimens and in vitro. miR-144 can inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell apoptosis in PCa cells. Therefore, miR-144 has the potential to be used as a biomarker for predicting the progression of PCa.""","""['Xin-Bo Sun', 'Yong-Wei Chen', 'Qi-Sheng Yao', 'Xu-Hua Chen', 'Min He', 'Cong-Bo Chen', 'Yong Yang', 'Xiao-Xin Gong', 'Li Huang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['MiRNA-26a Contributes to the Acquisition of Malignant Behaviors of Doctaxel-Resistant Lung Adenocarcinoma Cells through Targeting EZH2.', 'Involvement of aberrantly activated HOTAIR/EZH2/miR-193a feedback loop in progression of prostate cancer.', 'MiR-605-3p inhibits malignant progression of prostate cancer by up-regulating EZH2.', 'EZH2 as a new therapeutic target in brain tumors: Molecular landscape, therapeutic targeting and future prospects.', 'The Role of Different Types of microRNA in the Pathogenesis of Breast and Prostate Cancer.', 'MicroRNA, mRNA, and Proteomics Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets for Improving Lung Cancer Treatment Outcomes.', 'Dysregulation of EZH2/miR-138-5p Axis Contributes to Radiosensitivity in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cell by Downregulating Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1 Alpha (HIF-1α).', 'Downregulation of cell division cycle-associated protein 7 (CDCA7) suppresses cell proliferation, arrests cell cycle of ovarian cancer, and restrains angiogenesis by modulating enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) expression.', 'Identification of MicroRNAs as Viable Aggressiveness Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer.', 'Exosomal MicroRNAs Mediating Crosstalk Between Cancer Cells With Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts and Tumor-Associated Macrophages in the Tumor Microenvironment.']"""

Patients and methods:   We created a rapid, objective, automated, and high-throughput detection device for hexylaminolevulinate-mediated FVUC, named the cellular fluorescence analysis unit-II (CFAU-II). Two different cohorts were used in this study: (i) screening test for primary bladder cancer (165 patients with bladder cancer and 52 controls), and (ii) surveillance test for detecting intravesical recurrent tumour (192 patients with treated non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer and 15 with post-nephroureterectomy upper urinary tract cancer). Voided urine samples were subjected to urine analysis, conventional VUC (cVUC), and FVUC. Diagnostic performance was compared between cVUC, FVUC, and a combination of the two.  Results:   A total of 614 urine samples were successfully collected, processed, and analysed. Comparative analysis of the screening test cohort demonstrated that the overall sensitivity of FVUC (63%, P < 0.001) and combination testing (72%, P < 0.001) was significantly higher than that of cVUC (29%). FVUC was found to be superior in most of the subgroups, especially in low-grade, Ta, and small tumours. Analysis of the surveillance test cohort showed that combination testing achieved a sensitivity of 82% and a negative predictive value of 98%, whereas those of cVUC were 39% and 96%, respectively. According to the pathological finding of recurrent tumours presenting false-negative result in the FVUC, the majority of the overlooked recurrent diseases were Ta low-grade tumours. Logistic regression analysis suggested an association between the risk of false-positive results and high density of urine white blood cells and alkaluria.  Conclusion:   The present findings clearly demonstrate that FVUC using the newly developed automation technology has superior sensitivity to cVUC for both screening for primary bladder cancer and recurrent tumour detection.

Newer techniques, such as deep learning (DL), have been applied to medical imaging, leading to improvements in image quality. Our goal is to evaluate the performance of a new deep learning-based reconstruction method, ""DLR"" in improving image quality and mitigating artifacts, which is now commercially available as AIRTM Recon DL (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI). We hypothesize that applying DLR to the T2WI images of the prostate provides improved image quality and reduced artifacts.  Methods:   This study included 31 patients with a history of prostate cancer that had a multiparametric MRI of the prostate with an endorectal coil (ERC) at 1.5 T or 3.0 T. Four series of T2-weighted images were generated in total: one set with the ERC signal turned on (ERC) and another set with the ERC signal turned off (Non-ERC). Each of these sets then reconstructed using two different reconstruction methods: conventional reconstruction (Conv) and DL Recon (DLR): ERCDLR, ERCConv, Non-ERCDLR, and Non-ERCConv. Three radiologists independently reviewed and scored the four sets of images for (i) image quality, (ii) artifacts, and (iii) visualization of anatomical landmarks and tumor.  Results:   The Non-ERCDLR scored as the best series for (i) overall image quality (p < 0.001), (ii) reduced artifacts (p < 0.001), and (iii) visualization of anatomical landmarks and tumor.

Materials and methods:   A 20-item online survey was sent on May 25, 2020 to 170 expert GU medical oncologists from Europe and North America. The survey solicited responses to changes in GU cancer management in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data was collected and managed via a secure REDCap Database.  Results:   Surveys were completed by 78 (45.8%) of 170 GU oncologists between May 25, 2020 and June 25, 2020. Clinical practice changes owing to COVID-19 in at least one scenario were reported by 79.1% of responders, most pronounced in prostate cancer (71.8%) and least pronounced in urothelial cancer (23%). Preferences for change in management varied by country, with 78% (37/47) of United States oncologists indicating a change in their practice, 57% (4/7) of Canadian oncologists, and 79% (19/24) of European oncologists.  Conclusions:   This study suggests international practice changes are occurring in GU cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The variability in practice changes between countries may reflect differences in COVID-19 case load during the time point of data collection. These results, based on expert opinion during this rapidly changing crisis, may inform the oncologic community regarding the effects of COVID-19 on GU cancer care.""","""['Michal Sarfaty', 'Darren R Feldman', 'Michael J Morris', 'Robert J Motzer', 'Dana E Rathkopf', 'Ashley M Regazzi', 'Gopa Iyer', 'Martin H Voss', 'Dean F Bajorin', 'Jonathan E Rosenberg']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Management of Germ Cell Tumors During the Outbreak of the Novel Coronavirus Disease-19 Pandemic: A Survey of International Expertise Centers.', 'Perspectives on Oncology-Specific Language During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study.', 'Telehealth in Uro-oncology Beyond the Pandemic: Toll or Lifesaver?', 'Seminars Issue - COVID-19 and its impact on urologic oncology - Introduction to the first issue in a two-part series.', 'A Practical Approach to the Management of Cancer Patients During the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic: An International Collaborative Group.', 'The 2021 COVID-19 Artificial Intelligence Issue.']"""

Methods:   Two cohorts of men who experienced BCR after radical prostatectomy between 1998 and 2014 were employed. The Cox model was used to validate and model the probability of metastasis and death after BCR. Data from 817 men from the first cohort were used to develop a modified model and external validation was performed on 344 men from the second cohort.  Results:   Distant metastasis-free survival and cancer-specific survival from the time of BCR were significantly higher in patients with a low EAU BCR risk (prostate-specific antigen doubling time [PSADT] >1 year and pathologic Gleason score [pGS] ≤7) than in high EAU BCR risk patients (PSADT ≤1 year or pGS 8-10). In the high EAU BCR risk group, survival outcomes and efficacy of early salvage radiotherapy in patients with PSADT 6-12 months and pGS ≤7 were similar to those in the low EAU BCR risk group. The C-index, which predicts metastatic progression and cancer-specific death, improved after PSADT cutoff point was modified to 6 months, and was validated externally.  Conclusion:   EAU BCR risk stratification reliably identified patients at increased risk of metastasis and cancer-specific mortality in the present cohort. Modification of the PSADT cutoff point may help to optimize the predictive performance and utility of the EAU BCR risk groups in clinical practice.""","""['Sahyun Pak', 'Dong-Eun Lee', 'Dalsan You', 'In Gab Jeong', 'Jae Young Joung', 'Kang-Hyun Lee', 'Jun Hyuk Hong', 'Choung-Soo Kim', 'Hanjong Ahn']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Nomogram Predicting Prostate Cancer-specific Mortality for Men with Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Risk Stratification of Patients Candidate to Radical Prostatectomy Based on Clinical and Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Parameters: Development and External Validation of Novel Risk Groups.', 'PSA doubling time as a predictor of clinical progression after biochemical failure following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Markers and meaning of primary treatment failure.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Objective:   To evaluate the predictive value of AR-V7 expression in the prognosis of mHSPC patients receiving ADT.  Design, setting, and participants:   In this multicenter prospective cohort study, 310 mHSPC patients commencing ADT were enrolled. Standard immunohistochemical staining was used to assess AR-V7 protein expression in biopsy tissues collected before initiation of ADT.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate associations of AR-V7 status (positive vs negative) with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).  Results and limitations:   Sixty-four (21%) patients were AR-V7-positive and 246 (79%) patients were AR-V7-negative. The median follow-up for patients not confirmed dead was 25 mo (interquartile range 10-30). Compared to AR-V7-negative patients, AR-V7-positive patients had significantly shorter PFS (hazard ratio [HR] 47.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 25.83-86.94) and OS (HR 3.57, 95% CI 1.46-8.72). In multivariable analysis, AR-V7 was an independent predictive factor (HR 7.61, 95% CI 5.24-11.06) for shorter PFS. Limitations include the sample size and follow-up period.  Conclusions:   AR-V7 expression in primary cancer tissue is correlated with poor prognosis for mHSPC patients receiving ADT.

We have developed a microtissue (MT) composed by TKhAMSCs and a scaffold made of polylactic acid microparticles and cell-derived extracellular matrix deposited by hAMSCs. The efficacy of these MTs as vehicles for TK-hAMSCs/GCV bystander therapy was evaluated in a rodent model of human prostate cancer. Subcutaneously implanted MTs were integrated in the surrounding tissue, allowing neovascularization and maintenance of TK-hAMSCs viability. Furthermore, MTs implanted beside tumors allowed TK-hAMSCs migration towards tumor cells and, after GCV administration, inhibited tumor growth.

The dissemination of cancer cells during resection and the consequent seeding into the bladder mucosa is the main cause of post-TURBT intravesical recurrence. Although the tumor dissemination is inevitable during conventional TURBT (cTURBT), this drawback can be overcome by tumor resection in one piece with intact surrounding normal tissues, referred to as en bloc resection. We previously described the photodynamic diagnosis (PDD)-assisted en bloc TURBT (EBTUR) technique and its favorable outcomes. Based on our preliminary studies, this randomized controlled trial was designed to evaluate the superiority of PDD-EBTUR to PDD-cTURBT.  Methods:   The FLEBER study is a single-center randomized controlled trial in NMIBC patients who require TURBT. The longest diameter of the tumor must be between 6 and 30 mm. A total of 160 eligible patients will be enrolled after screening and randomly allocated to the PDD-EBTUR (experimental) and PDD-cTURBT (control) groups in a 1:1 ratio (80 cases to 80 cases). All patients will be treated using a single, immediate postoperative intravesical chemotherapy with epirubicin. The primary endpoint of this trial is the 2-year recurrence-free survival after surgery in pathologically proven low- or intermediate-risk NMIBC. All patients will be monitored by cystoscopy and urine cytology every 3 months for 2 years. Patient data including adverse events and complications, and data from frequency volume charts, pain scales, and health-related QOL questionnaires will be collected before and after the TURBT at indicated visits.  Discussion:   The goal of this trial is to determine the potential benefits of PDD-cTURBT and PDD-EBTUR followed by a single immediate postoperative intravesical chemotherapy in patients with low- or intermediate-risk NMIBC who undergo TURBT. Ultimately, our findings will lead to the development of better interventions and potentially change the standard of care.

Approximately 30%-40% of these patients may develop prostate cancer (PCa) within a 5-year period, often not clinically significant. Current guidelines recommend a repeat biopsy within 3-6 months after the initial diagnosis, but it seem not to be the best strategy.  Methods: Objectives-evaluating the natural history of ASAP, stratifying the risk of csPCa after ASAP, identifying predictive factors of PCa after atypical diagnosis. Materials and methods-retrospective single-institutional study on patients undergoing prostate biopsy for suspicious PCa (2005-2016). We evaluated the incidence of overall PCa, intermediate-high risk of PCa and csPCa in case of ASAP, according to D'Amico classification and Epstein modified criteria.  Results:   Out of 4.567 patients undergoing prostate biopsy, ASAP was detected in 2.6% of cases. All patients with ASAP underwent repeat saturation biopsy within 6 months and PCa was diagnosed in 34.5%. According to D'Amico classification, 26%, 5.9%, and 2.5% had low, intermediate, and high-risk disease, respectively. According modified Epstein criteria, the incidence of csPCa was 12.6%. LRT showed that the overall probability to develop PCa doubled when PSA density (PSAD) moved from values lower than 0.13 ng/ml/cc to class 0.13-0.30 ng/ml/cc, and it tripled when PSAD was higher than 0.30 ng/ml/cc.  Conclusions:   The rate of csPCa in patients with an initial diagnosis of ASAP who had repeat biopsy was 12.6%. The overall PCa rate was 34.5%. Among patient undergoing RP, an upgrading from ncsPCa to csPCa was reported in 35% of cases. PSAD is the only predictive factor directly associated to the risk of developing PCa on repeat biopsy.

One way to broaden the therapeutic index could be to administer higher doses in combination with radioprotectors, since administered radioactivity is kept low today in order to avoid side-effects from a high absorbed dose to healthy tissue. Here, we investigated the human radical scavenger α1-microglobulin (A1M) together with 177-Lutetium (177Lu) labeled PSMA-617 in preclinical models with respect to therapeutic efficacy and kidney toxicity. Nude mice with subcutaneous LNCaP xenografts were injected with 50 or 100 MBq of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617, with or without injections of recombinant A1M (rA1M) (at T = 0 and T = 24 h). Kidney absorbed dose was calculated to 7.36 Gy at 4 days post a 100 MBq injection. Activity distribution was imaged with Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) at 24 h. Tumor volumes were measured continuously, and kidneys and blood were collected at termination (3-4 days and 3-4 weeks after injections). In a parallel set of experiments, mice were given [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 and rA1M as above and dynamic technetium-99m mercaptoacetyltriglycine ([99mTc]Tc-MAG3) SPECT imaging was performed prior to injection, and 3- and 6-months post injection. Blood and urine were continuously sampled. At termination (6 months) the kidneys were resected. Biomarkers of kidney function, expression of stress genes and kidney histopathology were analyzed. [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 uptake, in tumors and kidneys, as well as treatment efficacy did not differ between rA1M and vehicle groups. In mice given rA1M, [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 imaging revealed a significantly higher slope of initial uptake at three months compared to mice co-injected with [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 and vehicle. Little or no change compared to control was seen in urine albumin, serum/plasma urea levels, RT-qPCR analysis of stress response genes and in the kidney histopathological evaluation. In conclusion, [99mTc]Tc-MAG3 imaging presented itself as a sensitive tool to detect changes in kidney function revealing that administration of rA1M has a potentially positive effect on kidney perfusion and tubular function when combined with [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 therapy.

Palliative radiation therapy (RT) is a discretionary treatment and its use may vary based on patient and clinician factors.  Methods:   Using data from the SEER-Medicare linked database, we identified patients diagnosed with metastatic lung, prostate, breast, and colorectal cancers in 2010 through 2015 who received RT, and the radiation oncologists who treated them. The costs of radiation services for each patient over a 90-day episode were calculated, and radiation oncologists were assigned to cost quintiles. The use of advanced technologies (eg, intensity-modulated radiation, stereotactic RT) and the number of RT treatments (eg, any site, bone only) were identified. Multivariable random-effects models were constructed to estimate the proportion of variation in the use of advanced technologies and extended fractionation (>10 fractions) that could be explained by patient fixed effects versus physician random effects.  Results:   We identified 37,361 patients with metastatic lung cancer, 3,684 with metastatic breast cancer, 5,323 with metastatic prostate cancer, and 8,726 with metastatic colorectal cancer, with 34%, 27%, 22%, and 9% receiving RT within the first year, respectively. The use of advanced technologies and extended fractionation was associated with higher costs of care. Compared with the patient case-mix, physician variation accounted for a larger proportion of the variation in the use of advanced technologies for palliative RT and the use of extended fractionation.  Conclusions:   Differences in radiation oncologists' practice and choices, rather than differences in patient case-mix, accounted for a greater proportion of the variation in the use of advanced technologies and high-cost radiation services.""","""['Aileen B Chen', 'Jiangong Niu', 'Angel M Cronin', 'Ya-Chen Tina Shih', 'Sharon Giordano', 'Deborah Schrag']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Natl Compr Canc Netw""","""['Physician-Driven Variation in Nonrecommended Services Among Older Adults Diagnosed With Cancer.', 'National variation in the delivery of radiation oncology procedures in the non-facility-based setting.', 'Palliative radiation therapy practice in patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer: a Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance Consortium (CanCORS) Study.', 'Palliation of bone metastases: a survey of patterns of practice among Canadian radiation oncologists.', ""Review of patterns of practice and patients' preferences in the treatment of bone metastases with palliative radiotherapy."", 'Psychological Determinants of Physician Variation in End-of-Life Treatment Intensity: A Systematic Review and Meta-Synthesis.']"""

Current preclinical tumor imaging methods have largely focused on anatomic imaging (e.g., MRI, ultrasound), functional imaging (e.g., FDG-PET), and molecular imaging with exogenous contrast agents (e.g., fluorescence optical tomography). Here we utalize spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI), a noninvasive, label-free optical technique, for the wide-field quantification of changes in tissue optical scattering in preclinical tumor models during treatment with chemotherapy and antiangiogenic agents. Optical scattering is particularly sensitive to tissue micro-architectural changes, including those that occur during apoptosis, an early indicator of response to cytotoxicity induced by chemotherapy, thermotherapy, cryotherapy, or radiation therapy. We utilized SFDI to monitor responses of PC3/2G7 prostate tumors and E0771 mammary tumors to treatment with cyclophosphamide or the antiangiogenic agent DC101 for up to 49 days. The SFDI-derived scattering amplitude was highly correlated with cleaved caspase-3, a marker of apoptosis (ρp = 0.75), while the exponent of the scattering wavelength-dependence correlated with the cell proliferation marker PCNA (ρp = 0.69). These optical parameters outperformed tumor volume and several functional parameters (e.g., oxygen saturation and hemoglobin concentration) as an early predictive biomarker of treatment response. Quantitative diffuse optical scattering is thus a promising new early marker of treatment response, which does not require radiation or exogenous contrast agents.""","""['Syeda Tabassum', 'Anup Tank', 'Fay Wang', 'Kavon Karrobi', 'Cameron Vergato', 'Irving J Bigio', 'David J Waxman', 'Darren Roblyer']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['Spatial frequency domain imaging for monitoring immune-mediated chemotherapy treatment response and resistance in a murine breast cancer model.', 'Impact of tumor vascularity on responsiveness to antiangiogenesis in a prostate cancer stem cell-derived tumor model.', 'Macroscopic optical physiological parameters correlate with microscopic proliferation and vessel area breast cancer signatures.', 'Current standards and new concepts in MRI and PET response assessment of antiangiogenic therapies in high-grade glioma patients.', 'Quantitative In Vivo Imaging of Tissue Absorption, Scattering, and Hemoglobin Concentration in Rat Cortex Using Spatially Modulated Structured Light.', 'Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy of Changes in Tumor Microenvironment in Response to Different Doses of Radiation.', 'Type-I interferon signaling is essential for robust metronomic chemo-immunogenic tumor regression in murine breast cancer.', 'Metronomic Chemotherapy for Metastatic Breast Cancer Treatment: Clinical and Preclinical Data between Lights and Shadows.', 'Spatial frequency domain imaging for monitoring immune-mediated chemotherapy treatment response and resistance in a murine breast cancer model.']"""

Methods:   The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets were used to divide differentially expressed lncRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), and mRNAs. The expression of PCA3, miR-140-5p, RFX7 and ABCA1 were determined by qPCR or Western blot in ox-LDL-treated macrophages. Macrophage lipid accumulation s was evaluated using the Oil Red O staining and high-performance liquid chromatography. Target relationships among PCA3, miR-140-5p, RFX7, and ABCA1 promoter area were validated via dual-luciferase reporter gene assay or chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. The apoE-/- mouse model in vivo was designed to evaluate the effect of PCA3 on the reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) and atherosclerosis.  Results:   PCA3 was down-regulated in foam cells, whereas miR-140-5p was highly expressed. Overexpression of PCA3 promoted ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux and reduced lipid accumulation in macrophages. Besides, RFX7 bound to the ABCA1 promoter and increased ABCA1 expression. Targeted relationships and interactions on the expression between miR-140-5p and PCA3 or RFX7 were elucidated. PCA3 up-regulated ABCA1 expression by binding to miR-140-5p to up-regulate RFX7 and ABCA1 expression in macrophages.

Methods and materials:   The first clinical Synchrony on Radixact system was recently installed and tested at our institution. Various clinical workflows, including fiducial implantation, computed tomography simulation, treatment planning, delivery quality assurance, treatment simulation, and delivery, for both fiducial-free and fiducial-based motion tracking methods were developed. Treatment planning and delivery data from initial patients, including dosimetric benefits, real-time target detection, model building, motion tracking accuracy, delivery smoothness, and extra dose from real-time radiographic imaging, were analyzed.  Results:   The Synchrony on Radixact system was tested to be within its performance specifications and has been used to treat 10 lung (fiducial-free) and 5 prostate (fiducial-based) patients with cancer so far in our clinic. The success of these treatments, especially for fiducial-free tracking, depends on multiple factors, including careful selection of the patient, appropriate setting of system parameters, appropriate positioning of the patient and skin markers, and use of treatment simulation. For the lung tumor cases, difficulties in model building, due primarily to the changes of target detectability or respiration patterns, were observed, which led to important system upgrades, including the addition of a treatment delivery simulation capability. Motion tracking metrics for all treated patients were within specifications, for example, (1) delivery quality assurance passing rates >95%; (2) extra dose from radiograph <0.5% of the prescription dose; and (3) average Potential Diff, measured Δ, and Rigid Body were within 6.5, 2.9, and 3.9 mm, respectively.

Our study aimed to quantify changes in bone mineral density in men with high risk prostate cancer on long-term androgen deprivation therapy and calcium and vitamin D supplementation.  Materials and methods:   Bone mineral density analysis was conducted for localized high risk prostate cancer patients enrolled in the phase III randomized trial PCS-V (Prostate Cancer Study 5), comparing conventional and hypofractionated radiation therapy. Patients received 28 months of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist and calcium and vitamin D supplementation (500 mg calcium BID+400 IU vitamin D3 BID). The areal density and T-scores (spine, femoral neck and total femur) at baseline and 30 months of followup were extracted, and the absolute change was calculated. Clinical bone density status (normal, osteopenia, osteoporosis) was monitored.  Results:   The lumbar spine, femoral neck and total femoral bone mineral density were measured for 226, 231, and 173 patients, respectively. The mean percent change in bone mineral density was -2.65%, -2.76% and -4.27% for these respective sites (p <0.001 for all). The average decrease in bone mineral density across all sites was -3.2%, with no decline in bone mineral density category in most patients (83%). Eight patients (4%) became osteoporotic.

Materials and methods:   International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Sexual Health Inventory For Men (SHIM), and Expanded Prostate cancer Index Composite Short Form (EPIC-26) were prospectively collected for men with low/intermediate-risk cancer treated at a single institution. We used Generalized Estimating Equations to identify associations between variables and early (3 to 6 mo) or late (1 to 2 y) PRQOL scores. Minimally important differences (MID) were compared with assess clinical relevance.  Results:   A total of 342 LDR, 159 HDR, and 112 SBRT patients treated from 2001 to 2018 were eligible. Gleason score, PSA, and age were lower among LDR patients compared with HDR/SBRT. Unadjusted baseline IPSS score was similar among all groups. Adjusted IPSS worsened at all time points compared with baseline after LDR/HDR. At early/late time points, rates of IPSS MID after LDR were higher compared to HDR/SBRT. There were no IPSS differences between SBRT and HDR. All modalities showed early and late SHIM worsening. There were no temporal differences in SHIM between SBRT and brachytherapy. There were no differences in EPIC subdomains between HDR and SBRT. Bowel symptoms worsened early after SBRT, whereas urinary irritative/obstructive symptoms worsened late after HDR. Among all domains, MID after SBRT and HDR were similar.  Conclusions:   In a cohort of patients treated with modern radiotherapy techniques, HDR and SBRT resulted in clinically meaningful improved urinary PRQOL compared with LDR.""","""['Jonathan J Paly', 'Brian L Egleston', 'Jessica K Wong', 'Nina Burbure', 'Mark L Sobczak', 'Shelly B Hayes', 'David Y T Chen', 'Eric M Horwitz', 'Mark A Hallman']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Am J Clin Oncol""","""['Health-related quality-of-life changes due to high-dose-rate brachytherapy, low-dose-rate brachytherapy, or intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of quality of life after stereotactic body radiotherapy and surgery for early-stage prostate cancer.', 'After low and high dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy followed by IMRT radiotherapy for intermediate and high risk prostate cancer.', 'A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Local Salvage Therapies After Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer (MASTER).', 'Quality of life after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Stereotactic Radiation Therapy versus Brachytherapy: Relative Strengths of Two Highly Efficient Options for the Treatment of Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Automatic localization of the prostatic urethra for image guided radiation therapy.']"""

For clinical application as an effective diagnostic tool, however, improved analytical methods for complex biological fluids are required. Here, we developed a reliable rapid urine analysis system based on surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) using 3D-stacked silver nanowires (AgNWs) on a glass fiber filter (GFF) sensor and applied it to the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer. Urine samples were pretreated with centrifugation to remove large debris and with calcium ion addition to improve the binding of metabolites to AgNWs. The label-free urine-SERS detection using the AgNW-GFF SERS sensor showed different spectral patterns and distinguishable specific peaks in three groups: normal control (n = 30), pancreatic cancer (n = 22), and prostate cancer (n = 22). Multivariate analyses of SERS spectra using unsupervised principal component analysis and supervised orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis showed excellent discrimination between the pancreatic cancer group and the prostate cancer group as well as between the normal control group and the combined cancer groups.

However, whether it plays important roles in cervical cancer remains unclear. The present study thus aimed to determine the precise role of LINC01006 in cervical cancer and elucidate its regulatory mechanisms. The expression of LINC01006 in cervical cancer was examined by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Cell proliferation assay, flow cytometric analysis, Transwell migration and invasion assays, and tumor xenograft model experiments were performed to elucidate the roles of LINC01006 in cervical cancer. Bioinformatics analysis, luciferase reporter assay, RNA immunoprecipitation and rescue experiments were performed for mechanistic analyses. The expression of LINC01006 was found to be upregulated in cervical cancer and to be associated with a poor prognosis. The absence of LINC01006 inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of cervical cancer cells, whereas it promoted cell apoptosis in vitro. The downregulation of LINC01006 impeded tumor growth in vivo. LINC01006 was verified as an endogenous 'sponge' that competed for microRNA‑28‑5p (miR‑28‑5p), which resulted in the upregulation of the miR‑28‑5p target P21‑activated kinase 2 (PAK2). Rescue experiments revealed that the suppression of miR‑28‑5p expression or the overexpression of PAK2 abrogated the effects of LINC01006 downregulation on malignant cellular functions in cervical cancer. On the whole, the present study demonstrates that LINC01006 exhibits tumor‑promoting functions in cervical cancer via the regulation of the miR‑28‑5p/PAK2 axis.

Mobility is fundamental for quality of life and church attendance to be associated with improved physical functioning. Few studies have examined how religious participation have implications for mobility limitation among men in general and among prostate cancer survivors in particular. The purpose of this study was to assess the association between church attendance and mobility limitation among Black and White prostate cancer patients and survivors. Data for this investigation were drawn from the Diagnosis and Decisions in Prostate Cancer Treatment Outcomes Study that consisted of 804 Black and White men with complete information on the primary outcome and predictor variables. Mobility limitation was the primary outcome variable, and church attendance was the main independent variable. The analytic sample was almost equally divided between Black (N = 382) and White men (N = 422). The proportion of Black men reporting mobility limitation (30.09%) more than doubled the corresponding percentage for White men (14.7%). Black men had a higher proportion of individuals who reported weekly church attendance (49.2% vs. 45.0%). Fully adjusted modified Poisson regression models produced results indicating that respondents attending church weekly had a lower mobility limitation prevalence (PR = 0.56, 95% CI [0.39, 0.81]) than those never attending church. Results from this study contribute to the body of evidence asserting the health benefits of church attendance.

Here, we explored whether nutritional status (NS) is associated with HRQoL in men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Methods: Men with mCRPC enrolled into this prospective observational study were allocated to one of the four NS categories based on clinical, laboratory, and patient self-reported criteria: well-nourished (WN), nutritional risk without criteria for cachexia/sarcopenia (NR), sarcopenia, and cachexia. The HRQoL was evaluated by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) questionnaire. Association between NS and self-reported HRQoL was sought by the linear regression model, which was adjusted for known prognostic variables and body mass index. Results: Over the period of two years, 141 patients were enrolled. Their median age was 74.1 years (IQR 68.6-79.4 years) and majority of them were minimally symptomatic. Fifty-nine patients (41.8%) were WN, followed by 24 (17%), 42 (29.8%), and 16 (11.4%) patients with NR, sarcopenia, and cachexia, respectively. As compared to WN patients, all three other NS categories were significant negative predictors of HRQoL (P < 0.04).

Six-month safety and effectiveness were evaluated in subgroups who had/had not received prior chemotherapy (prior-chemo/no prior-chemo groups), and a subgroup who had not received concomitant androgen-receptor axis-targeted agents (ARATs).  Results:   In the overall population (n = 296), the prior-chemo group (n = 126) tended to have more bone metastases, more analgesic use, and higher prostate-specific antigen values than the no prior-chemo group (n = 170).

TBX1 has been reported to have a hypermethylated cytosine guanine dinucleotide island around its second exon, which was related to prostate cancer (PCa) progression. However, the role and exact mechanism of TBX1 in PCa remains unknown. Using human prostate samples, online data mining and multiple in vitro and in vivo models, we examined the biological role and underlying mechanisms of TBX1 in PCa. TBX1 was highly expressed in PCa tissues, and high TBX1 expression was positively associated with Gleason score, pathological tumor stage, pathological lymph node stage, extraprostatic extension and disease/progression-free survival. In vitro and in vivo data demonstrated that TBX1 silencing inhibits PCa cell proliferation and colony formation and increases the cell population at the G0/G1 phase. The exogenous expression of TBX1 rescued these phenotypes. Mechanistically, TBX1 silencing suppressed the expression of 45S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), which was rescued by the exogenous expression of TBX1. TBX1 silencing inhibited the monomethylation of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4me1) binding with the non-coding intergenic spacer (IGS) regions of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and the recruitment of upstream binding factor to the promoter and IGS regions of rDNA. The drug-induced enhancement of H3K4me1 counteracted the effect of TBX1 silencing.

However, no literature exists on whether this chronological-seasonal evolution is also present within ED symptomatology. We hypothesized ED would follow the seasonal pattern of its lifestyle-influenced comorbid conditions and exhibit increased incidence during winter months. In order to investigate the seasonal variation of ED in the United States between 2009 and 2019, Internet search query data were obtained using Google Trends. Normalized search volume was determined during the winter and summer seasons for ED, other diseases known to be significantly associated with ED (T2DM and CAD), kidney stones (positive control), and prostate cancer (negative control). There were significantly more internet search queries for ED during the winter than during the summer (p = 0.001). CAD and T2DM also had significantly increased search volume during winter months compared to summer months (p < 0.001 and p = 0.011, respectively). By contrast, searches for kidney stones were significantly increased in the summer than in the winter (p < 0.001). There was no significant seasonal variation in the relative search frequency for prostate cancer (p = 0.75). In conclusion, Google Trends internet search data across a ten-year period in the United States suggested a seasonal variation in ED, which implies an increase in ED during winter. This novel finding in ED epidemiology may help increase awareness of ED's associated lifestyle risk factors, which may facilitate early medical evaluation and treatment for those at risk of both ED and cardiovascular disease.""","""['Belén Mora Garijo', 'Jonathan E Katz', 'Aubrey Greer', 'Mia Gonzalgo', 'Alejandro García López', 'Leslie Deane', 'Ranjith Ramasamy']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Impot Res""","""['Seasonal trends in tinnitus symptomatology: evidence from Internet search engine query data.', 'Seasonal trends in restless legs symptomatology: evidence from Internet search query data.', 'Seasonal trends in hypertension in Poland: evidence from Google search engine query data.', 'More than just a stye: identifying seasonal patterns using google trends, and a review of infodemiological literature in ophthalmology.', 'Diabetes, obesity, and erectile dysfunction.', 'Bradykinin B1 receptor antagonist protects against cold stress-induced erectile dysfunction in rats.', 'COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy linked to increased internet search queries for side effects on fertility potential in the initial rollout phase following Emergency Use Authorization.']"""

Objective:   To compare the functional and oncological outcomes between RARP and LRP at 3 mo of follow-up.  Design, setting, and participants:   In this multicentre, randomised, patient-blinded controlled trial, patients referred for radical prostatectomy to four hospitals in Germany were randomly assigned (3:1) to undergo either RARP or LRP.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary outcome was time to continence recovery at 3 mo based on the patient's pad diary. Secondary outcomes included continence and potency as well as quality of life in addition to oncological outcomes for up to 3 yr of follow-up. Time to continence was analysed by log-rank test and depicted by the Kaplan-Meier method. Continuous measurements were analysed by means of linear mixed models.  Results and limitations:   A total of 782 patients were randomised. The primary endpoint was evaluable in 718 patients (547 RARPs; full analysis set). At 3 mo, the difference in continence rates was 8.7% in favour of RARP (54% vs 46%, p = 0.027). RARP remained superior to LRP even after adjustment for the randomisation stratum nerve sparing and age >65 yr (hazard ratio = 1.40 [1.09-1.81], p = 0.008). A significant benefit in early potency recovery was also identified, while similar oncological and morbidity outcomes were documented. It is a limitation that the influence of different anastomotic techniques was not investigated in this study.  Conclusions:   RARP resulted in significantly better continence recovery at 3 mo.

All cases were performed in the office under local anesthesia (LA) without sedation. The majority received no prophylactic antibiotics. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical records of 242 consecutive fTP-Bx cases using the PrecisionPoint™ Transperineal Access System (PPTAS) performed under LA without sedation by a single urologist (R.J.S.) at Kaiser Permanente Southern California. We compared complication rates of this series of cases to our initial series of 62 fTP-Bx cases without the PrecisionPoint as well as 133 transrectal prostate biopsy cases performed before we adopted the transperineal approach. Results: Of the 242 consecutive free-hand transperineal biopsies performed between August 26, 2016 and December 31, 2018, 212 (88%) received no antibiotic prophylaxis. Medians for age, prostate-specific antigen, prostate volume, prostate-specific antigen density, and cores sampled were 63 years, 7.2 ng/mL, 50 mL, 0.15 ng/mL/cc, and 20 cores, respectively. Detection rates of overall and clinically significant prostate cancer averaged 43.4% (105/242) and 14% (35/242), respectively. Average visual analog scale pain rating was 3.9 and average procedure time was 20 minutes. Complication rates of sepsis, acute urinary retention, clot retention, and perianal abscess were 0.0% (0/242), 0.4% (1/242), 1.2% (3/242) and 0.4% (1/242), respectively. Conclusions: This series of office-based free-hand transperineal biopsy under LA without sedation performed with the PPTAS contains a large number of cases in which prophylactic antibiotics were not administered, yet there were no complications of postbiopsy sepsis.

The PARP family member, PARP7, is a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase that has been suggested to play a tumor suppressive role in breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancer. Here, we have investigated how androgen signaling regulates PARP7 homeostasis in prostate cancer cells, where PARP7 is a direct target gene of AR. We found that the PARP7 protein is extremely short-lived, with a half-life of 4.5 min. We show that in addition to its transcriptional regulation by AR, PARP7 is subject to androgen-dependent post-transcriptional regulation that increases its half-life to 25.6 min. This contrasts with PARP1, PARP2, PARP9, and PARP14, which do not display rapid turnover and are not regulated by androgen signaling. Androgen- and AR-dependent stabilization of PARP7 leads to accumulation in the nucleus, which we suggest is a major site of action. Mutations in the catalytic domain, the Cys3His1 zinc finger, and WWE (tryptophan-tryptophan-glutamate) domains in PARP7 each reduce the degradation rate of PARP7, suggesting the overall structure of the protein is tuned for its rapid turnover. Our finding that PARP7 is regulated by AR signaling both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally in prostate cancer cells suggests the dosage of PARP7 protein is subject to tight regulation.""","""['Teddy Kamata', 'Chun-Song Yang', 'Tiffany A Melhuish', 'Henry F Frierson Jr', 'David Wotton', 'Bryce M Paschal']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cells""","""['PARP7 mono-ADP-ribosylates the agonist conformation of the androgen receptor in the nucleus.', 'Androgen signaling uses a writer and a reader of ADP-ribosylation to regulate protein complex assembly.', 'TCDD-inducible poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (TIPARP/PARP7) mono-ADP-ribosylates and co-activates liver X receptors.', 'Function and regulation of the mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase ARTD10.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Unravelling the Role of PARP1 in Homeostasis and Tumorigenesis: Implications for Anti-Cancer Therapies and Overcoming Resistance.', 'Use of PARP inhibitors in prostate cancer: from specific to broader application.', 'Reduced Colonic Mucosal Injury in 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-Dioxin Poly ADP-Ribose Polymerase (TIPARP/PARP7)-Deficient Mice.', 'NAD+-consuming enzymes in immune defense against viral infection.', 'PARP7 mono-ADP-ribosylates the agonist conformation of the androgen receptor in the nucleus.']"""

The design goal was to make the size of the TRUS-PA probe similar to that of general TRUS probes (i.e., about 20 mm), for the convenience of the patients.

Consequently, the effects of sex and age on the location of metastases is also unknown. This study sought to investigate age- and sex-related differences in the distribution of metastases in patients with UTUC.  Materials and methods:   Within the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database (2000-2015), we identified 1,340 patients with metastatic UTUC. Sites of metastasis were assessed according to age (≤63, 64-72, 73-79, and ≥80 years) and sex. Comparison was performed with trend and chi-square tests.  Results:   Of 1,340 patients with metastatic UTUC, 790 (59.0%) were men (median age, 71 years) and 550 (41.0%) were women (median age, 74 years). The lung was the most common site of metastases in men and women (28.2% and 26.4%, respectively), followed by bone in men (22.3% vs 18.0% of women) and liver in women (24.4% vs 20.5% of men). Increasing age was associated with decreasing rates of brain metastasis in men (from 6.5% to 2.9%; P=.03) and women (from 5.9% to 0.7%; P=.01). Moreover, increasing age in women, but not in men, was associated with decreasing rates of lung (from 33.3% to 24.3%; P=.02), lymph node (from 28.9% to 15.8%; P=.01), and bone metastases (from 22.2% to 10.5%; P=.02). Finally, rates of metastases in multiple organs did not vary with age or sex (65.2% in men vs 66.5% in women).  Conclusions:   Lung, bone, and liver metastases are the most common metastatic sites in both sexes. However, the distribution of metastases varies according to sex and age.

This study aimed to explore the exact functions of FTO in the progression of prostate cancer metastasis.  Main methods:   Dot blot and m6A RNA methylation quantification assays were performed to determine m6A levels. The protein and mRNA expression levels were detected using immunoblot (IB) and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analyses. Cell invasion and migration abilities were measured using transwell and wound healing assays. Bioinformatics was used to measure the expression level of FTO and possible correlation between FTO levels and advanced tumor stage. Immunofluorescence (IF) was performed to measure the cellular localization of FTO.  Key findings:   FTO was downregulated in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines, and the m6A content was increased. Importantly, patients with lower FTO expression had advanced tumor stage and higher Gleason scores.

Changes in medication-taking patterns of AAP or enzalutamide may arise due to clinical (e.g. toxicity) and non-clinical (e.g. patient compliance) reasons in men with mCRPC. However, it is unclear how this affects PSA progression.  Methods:   Veterans Health Administration electronic health record database was used to identify Veterans diagnosed with prostate cancer who initiated AAP or enzalutamide (index) from April 2010 to December 2016. PSA progression was defined as the first rise in PSA of ≥2 ng/mL and ≥25% above nadir. The relative dose intensity (RDI) was defined as the ratio of the total dispensed dose over the last two months to the standard recommended dose and was updated monthly. Dose reduction was assessed using a threshold of RDI < 80%.  Results:   The cohort included 6069 Veterans aged 74.6 years on average. Mean follow-up was 12.3 months. PSA progression occurred in 62.7% of patients. About 63.6% of AAP- and 67.2% of enzalutamide-treated patients had ≥1 occurrence of RDI <80%. RDI <80% was associated with an 8.8% higher risk of PSA progression (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.088; p = .019; 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.014; 1.166]).  Conclusions:   Dose reduction was observed in most patients and was associated with significantly higher risk of PSA progression in men with mCRPC. These results suggest future efforts to minimize dose reductions for non-clinical reasons are warranted and that patient adherence should be encouraged to limit the risk of PSA progression.""","""['Stephen J Freedland', 'Sophia Li', 'Dominic Pilon', 'Rachel H Bhak', 'Sahil Narkhede', 'Patrick Lefebvre', 'Yinong Young-Xu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Curr Med Res Opin""","""['Antitumour Activity and Safety of Enzalutamide in Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Previously Treated with Abiraterone Acetate Plus Prednisone for ≥24 weeks in Europe.', 'Clinical Outcomes from Androgen Signaling-directed Therapy after Treatment with Abiraterone Acetate and Prednisone in Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Post Hoc Analysis of COU-AA-302.', 'Economic Outcomes in Patients with Chemotherapy-Naïve Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Treated with Enzalutamide or Abiraterone Acetate Plus Prednisone.', 'Efficacy and safety of second-line agents for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer progressing after docetaxel.

Methods:   Images of a phantom with small hot sphere inserts and 20 prostate cancer patients were acquired with a digital PET/CT using list-mode and reconstructed with ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) and TVREM with seven penalisation factors between 0.01 and 0.42 for 2 and 3 minutes-per-bed (m/b) acquisition. The contrast recovery (CR) and background variability (BV) of the phantom, image noise of the liver, and SUVmax of the lesions were measured. Qualitative image quality was scored by two radiologists using a 5-point scale (1-poor, 5-excellent).  Results:   The performance of CR, BV, and image noise, and the gain of SUVmax was higher for TVREM 2 m/b groups with the penalization of 0.07 to 0.28 compared to OSEM 3 m/b group (all p < 0.05). The image noise of OSEM 3 m/b group was equivalent to TVREM 2 and 3 m/b groups with a penalization of 0.14 and 0.07, while lesions' SUVmax increased 15 and 20%. The highest qualitative score was attained at the penalization of 0.21 (3.30 ± 0.66) for TVREM 2 m/b groups and the penalization 0.14 (3.80 ± 0.41) for 3 m/b group that equal to or greater than OSEM 3 m/b group (2.90 ± 0.45, p = 0.2 and p < 0.001).

Objective:   To validate the GC in the context of a randomized phase 3 trial.  Design, setting, and participants:   This ancillary study used RP specimens from the phase 3 placebo-controlled NRG/RTOG 9601 randomized clinical trial conducted from March 1998 to March 2003. The specimens were centrally reviewed, and RNA was extracted from the highest-grade tumor available in 2019 with a median follow-up of 13 years. Clinical-grade whole transcriptomes from samples passing quality control were assigned GC scores (scale, 0-1). A National Clinical Trials Network-approved prespecified statistical plan included the primary objective of validating the independent prognostic ability of GC for DM, with secondary end points of prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and overall survival (OS). Data were analyzed from September 2019 to December 2019.  Intervention:   Salvage radiotherapy (sRT) with or without 2 years of bicalutamide.  Main outcomes and measures:   The preplanned primary end point of this study was the independent association of the GC with the development of DM.  Results:   In this ancillary study of specimens from a phase 3 randomized clinical trial, GC scores were generated from 486 of 760 randomized patients with a median follow-up of 13 years; samples from a total of 352 men (median [interquartile range] age, 64.5 (60-70) years; 314 White [89.2%] participants) passed microarray quality control and comprised the final cohort for analysis. On multivariable analysis, the GC (continuous variable, per 0.1 unit) was independently associated with DM (hazard ratio [HR], 1.17; 95% CI, 1.05-1.32; P = .006), PCSM (HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.20-1.63; P < .001), and OS (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.06-1.29; P = .002) after adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, Gleason score, T stage, margin status, entry prostate-specific antigen, and treatment arm. Although the original planned analysis was not powered to detect a treatment effect interaction by GC score, the estimated absolute effect of bicalutamide on 12-year OS was less when comparing patients with lower vs higher GC scores (2.4% vs 8.9%), which was further demonstrated in men receiving early sRT at a prostate-specific antigen level lower than 0.7 ng/mL (-7.8% vs 4.6%).  Conclusions and relevance:   This ancillary validation study of the Decipher GC in a randomized trial cohort demonstrated association of the GC with DM, PCSM, and OS independent of standard clinicopathologic variables.

Short, noncontrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or transrectal ultrasonography might overcome these limitations.  Objective:   To compare the performance of PSA testing, MRI, and ultrasonography as screening tests for prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   This prospective, population-based, blinded cohort study was conducted at 7 primary care practices and 2 imaging centers in the United Kingdom. Men 50 to 69 years of age were invited for prostate cancer screening from October 10, 2018, to May 15, 2019.  Interventions:   All participants underwent screening with a PSA test, MRI (T2 weighted and diffusion), and ultrasonography (B-mode and shear wave elastography). The tests were independently interpreted without knowledge of other results. Both imaging tests were reported on a validated 5-point scale of suspicion. If any test result was positive, a systematic 12-core biopsy was performed. Additional image fusion-targeted biopsies were performed if the MRI or ultrasonography results were positive.  Main outcomes and measures:   The main outcome was the proportion of men with positive MRI or ultrasonography (defined as a score of 3-5 or 4-5) or PSA test (defined as PSA ≥3 μg/L) results. Key secondary outcomes were the number of clinically significant and clinically insignificant cancers detected if each test was used exclusively. Clinically significant cancer was defined as any Gleason score of 3+4 or higher.  Results:   A total of 2034 men were invited to participate; of 411 who attended screening, 408 consented to receive all screening tests. The proportion with positive MRI results (score, 3-5) was higher than the proportion with positive PSA test results (72 [17.7%; 95% CI, 14.3%-21.8%] vs 40 [9.9%; 95% CI, 7.3%-13.2%]; P < .001). The proportion with positive ultrasonography results (score, 3-5) was also higher than the proportion of those with positive PSA test results (96 [23.7%; 95% CI, 19.8%-28.1%]; P < .001). For an imaging threshold of score 4 to 5, the proportion with positive MRI results was similar to the proportion with positive PSA test results (43 [10.6%; 95% CI, 7.9%-14.0%]; P = .71), as was the proportion with positive ultrasonography results (52 [12.8%; 95% CI, 9.9%-16.5%]; P = .15). The PSA test (≥3 ng/mL) detected 7 clinically significant cancers, an MRI score of 3 to 5 detected 14 cancers, an MRI score of 4 to 5 detected 11 cancers, an ultrasonography score of 3 to 5 detected 9 cancer, and an ultrasonography score of 4 to 5 detected 4 cancers. Clinically insignificant cancers were diagnosed by PSA testing in 6 cases, by an MRI score of 3 to 5 in 7 cases, an MRI score of 4 to 5 in 5 cases, an ultrasonography score of 3 to 5 in 13 cases, and an ultrasonography score of 4 to 5 in 7 cases.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this cohort study, when screening the general population for prostate cancer, MRI using a score of 4 or 5 to define a positive test result compared with PSA alone at 3 ng/mL or higher was associated with more men diagnosed with clinically significant cancer, without an increase in the number of men advised to undergo biopsy or overdiagnosed with clinically insignificant cancer.

It manifests itself in the form of cystic lesions scattered throughout the brain parenchyma that are usually small in size and, depending on their stage of development, may appear with associated oedema or with calcifications inside them.  Case report:   We report the case of a 63-year-old male visiting due to constitutional symptoms, generalised pain and confusion. A cranial computed axial tomography (CAT) scan showed a right frontoparietal lesion with a cyst-like appearance and surrounding oedema, as well as several smaller lesions with calcifications inside them. Given the pseudotumoural appearance, an extension study was performed and a prostatic adenocarcinoma with universal bone metastases was detected. Treatment with antiparasitic medication and dexamethasone was started, with a good initial response, which later worsened with the onset of left hemiparesis. In the follow-up CAT scan, an increase in the right frontoparietal lesion with increased oedema was observed, related to the inflammatory response to the treatment. After a new course of antiparasitic drugs, the patient maintained a sustained and stable clinical response.  Conclusions:   The unusual feature of this case was a rare presentation of neurocysticercosis in the form of a pseudotumoural lesion. Few cases have been reported in the literature, and it is important to maintain a high level of clinical and radiological suspicion, as this type of lesion may be more resistant to the penetration of antiparasitic drugs and require longer treatment and even surgery.""","""['L Carazo-Barrios', 'V Delgado-Gil', 'O León-Plaza', 'C Gómez-Ayerbe']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Rev Neurol""","""['Neurocysticercosis.', 'Pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinoma mimicking neurocysticercosis: a case report.', '68Ga-Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Expression in Neurocysticercosis Lesions in a Patient With Prostate Carcinoma.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Giant racemose subarachnoid and intraventricular neurocysticercosis: A case report.']"""

Prostate cancer is considered one of the reasons that are leading to deaths worldwide. Data analysis of gene expression from microarray using machine learning and soft computing algorithms is a useful tool for detecting prostate cancer in medical diagnosis. Even though traditional machine learning methods have been successfully applied for detecting prostate cancer, the large number of attributes with a small sample size of microarray data is still a challenge that limits their ability for effective medical diagnosis. Selecting a subset of relevant features from all features and choosing an appropriate machine learning method can exploit the information of microarray data to improve the accuracy rate of detection. In this paper, we propose to use a correlation feature selection (CFS) method with random committee (RC) ensemble learning to detect prostate cancer from microarray data of gene expression. A set of experiments are conducted on a public benchmark dataset using 10-fold cross-validation technique to evaluate the proposed approach.

We sought to investigate the association between aspirin frequency and risk of lung cancer in The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial.  Methods:   Using data from 101,722 participants in PLCO, we used a Cox regression model coupling with propensity score to detect the association between aspirin frequency and lung cancer risk.  Results:   High-frequency aspirin use significantly increased risk of lung cancer by 28% compared to no use (HR =1.28; 95% CI, 1.14-1.45; P=3.37×10-5), especially for current smoker (HR =1.30; 95% CI, 1.07-1.57; P=6.82×10-3). However, the increased lung cancer risk due to high-frequency aspirin use significantly decreased with increasing bodyweight (HRinteraction =0.96; 95% CI, 0.94-0.99; P=1.26×10-2). Further, for participants with bodyweight <80 kg, high-frequency aspirin use showed an elevated risk at <76 years of age (HRage<76 =1.47; 95% CI, 1.25-1.73; P=3.81×10-6). Our study used propensity score under various confounding and stratification analyses by cardio-cerebrovascular status, which all presented similar evidences.  Conclusions:   High-frequency aspirin use is associated with the increased risk of lung cancer. Current smoker or people with age <76 years and bodyweight <80 kg should be more cautious to high-frequency aspirin use for lung cancer chemoprevention. This study provides a new insight for lung cancer chemoprevention.""","""['Xuesi Dong', 'Jieyu He', 'Lijuan Lin', 'Ying Zhu', 'Chao Chen', 'Li Su', 'Yang Zhao', 'Ruyang Zhang', 'Yongyue Wei', 'Feng Chen', 'David C Christiani']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Transl Lung Cancer Res""","""['Association of Aspirin Use With Mortality Risk Among Older Adult Participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial.', 'Aspirin use and ovarian cancer risk using extended follow-up of the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial.', 'Chemoprevention of colorectal cancer: systematic review and economic evaluation.', 'Effects of aspirin on risks of vascular events and cancer according to bodyweight and dose: analysis of individual patient data from randomised trials.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Chemopreventive Effects of Concomitant or Individual Use of Statins, Aspirin, Metformin, and Angiotensin Drugs: A Study Using Claims Data of 23 Million Individuals.']"""

Methods:   We determined the association between dietary sodium, potassium intake and lung cancer risk based on the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) cancer screening trial and the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). Totally 165,409 participants who completed the baseline questionnaire (BQ) and diet history questionnaire (DHQ) were included into the analytical dataset, including 92,984 (44,959 men and 48,025 women) from the PLCO trial and 72,425 (women only) from the WHI cohort. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of incident lung cancer associated with dietary potassium and sodium intake. The dose-response relationship was also described using the spline smoothed curve after adjusting covariates.  Results:   After the median follow-up of 8.55 and 18.56 years, 1,278 and 1,631 new cases of lung cancer were identified in the PLCO trial and WHI cohort, respectively. Intake of sodium was significantly associated with the incidence of lung cancer in the PLCO trial after multivariate adjustment for men (HR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.05-1.35; P for linear trend =0.044). There was a suggestion that lung cancer risk had a quadratic curve correlation with the increase of potassium intake for women (third vs. lowest quintile: HR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.54-0.96; P for quadratic trend =0.042). The similar results showing an inverse association between potassium intake and lung cancer risk were also observed in the WHI cohort for women (highest vs. lowest quintile: HR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.70-0.97; P for linear trend =0.009).

We have shown that in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and colon cancer, tumour associated circulating NK (TA-NK) and tumour infiltrating NK (TI-NK) exhibit pro-angiogenic phenotype/functions. However, there is still a lack of knowledge concerning the phenotype of peripheral blood (PB) NK (pNK) cells in prostate cancer (PCa). Here, we phenotypically and functionally characterized pNK from PCa patients (PCa TA-NKs) and investigated their interactions with endothelial cells and monocytes/macrophages. NK cell subset distribution in PB of PCa patients was investigated, by multicolor flow cytometry, for surface antigens expression. Protein arrays were performed to characterize the secretome on FACS-sorted pNK cells. Conditioned media (CM) from FACS-sorted PCa pTA-NKs were used to determine their ability to induce pro-inflammatory/pro-angiogenic phenotype/functions in endothelial cells, monocytes, and macrophages. CM from three different PCa (PC-3, DU-145, LNCaP) cell lines, were used to assess their effects on human NK cell polarization in vitro, by multicolor flow cytometry. We found that PCa pTA-NKs acquire the CD56brightCD9+CD49a+CXCR4+ phenotype, increased the expression of markers of exhaustion (PD-1, TIM-3) and are impaired in their degranulation capabilities. Similar effects were observed on healthy donor-derived pNK cells, exposed to conditioned media of three different PCa cell lines, together with increased production of pro-inflammatory chemokines/chemokine receptors CXCR4, CXCL8, CXCL12, reduced production of TNFα, IFNγ and Granzyme-B. PCa TA-NKs released factors able to support inflammatory angiogenesis in an in vitro model and increased the expression of CXCL8, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 mRNA in endothelial cells. Secretome analysis revealed the ability of PCa TA-NKs to release pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines involved in monocyte recruitment and M2-like polarization. Finally, CMs from PCa pTA-NKs recruit THP-1 and peripheral blood CD14+ monocyte and polarize THP-1 and peripheral blood CD14+ monocyte-derived macrophage towards M2-like/TAM macrophages. Our results show that PCa pTA-NKs acquire properties related to the pro-inflammatory angiogenesis in endothelial cells, recruit monocytes and polarize macrophage to an M2-like type phenotype.

However, all reported cases are of deidentified individuals without full medical and genomic data available in the public domain.  Patient and methods:   We present a case of whole-genome tumor and germline sequencing in a patient with advanced prostate cancer, who has agreed to make his genomic and clinical data publicly available.  Results:   We describe an 84-year-old Caucasian male with a Gleason 10 oligometastastic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. Whole-genome sequencing provided insights into his tumor's underlying mutational processes and the development of an SPOP mutation. It also revealed an androgen-receptor dependency of his cancer which was reflected in his durable response to radiation and hormonal therapy. Potentially actionable genomic lesions in the tumor were identified through a personalized medicine approach for potential future therapy, but at the moment, he remains in remission, illustrating the hormonal sensitivity of his SPOP-driven prostate cancer. We also placed this patient in the context of a large prostate-cancer cohort from the PCAWG (Pan-cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes) group. In this comparison, the patient's cancer appears typical in terms of the number and type of somatic mutations, but it has a somewhat larger contribution from the mutational process associated with aging.  Conclusion:   We combined the expertise of medical oncology and genomics approaches to develop a molecular tumor board to integrate the care and study of this patient, who continues to have an outstanding response to his combined modality treatment.

While a majority of PCa patients initially respond to ADT, the durability of response is variable and most patients will eventually develop incurable castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Our research objective is to identify potential early driver genes responsible for CRPC development.  Methods:   We have developed a unique panel of hormone-naïve PCa (HNPC) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models at the Living Tumor Laboratory. The PDXs provide a unique platform for driver gene discovery as they allow for the analysis of differentially expressed genes via transcriptomic profiling at various time points after mouse host castration. In the present study, we focused on genes with expression changes shortly after castration but before CRPC has fully developed. These are likely to be potential early drivers of CRPC development. Such genes were further validated for their clinical relevance using data from PCa patient databases. ZRSR2 was identified as a top gene candidate and selected for further functional studies.  Results:   ZRSR2 is significantly upregulated in our PDX models during the early phases of CRPC development after mouse host castration and remains consistently high in fully developed CRPC PDX models. Moreover, high ZRSR2 expression is also observed in clinical CRPC samples. Importantly, elevated ZRSR2 in PCa samples is correlated with poor patient treatment outcomes. ZRSR2 knockdown reduced PCa cell proliferation and delayed cell cycle progression at least partially through inhibition of the Cyclin D1 (CCND1) pathway.  Conclusion:   Using our unique HNPC PDX models that develop into CRPC after host castration, we identified ZRSR2 as a potential early driver of CRPC development.""","""['Haiqing He', 'Jun Hao', 'Xin Dong', 'Yu Wang', 'Hui Xue', 'Sifeng Qu', 'Stephen Yiu Chuen Choi', 'Xinpei Ci', 'Yong Wang', 'Rebecca Wu', 'Mingchen Shi', 'Xiaokun Zhao', 'Colin Collins', 'Dong Lin', 'Yuzhuo Wang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Patient-derived Hormone-naive Prostate Cancer Xenograft Models Reveal Growth Factor Receptor Bound Protein 10 as an Androgen Receptor-repressed Gene Driving the Development of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Melatonin inhibits lipid accumulation to repress prostate cancer progression by mediating the epigenetic modification of CES1.', 'SLFN5 Regulates LAT1-Mediated mTOR Activation in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) encourages prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing decisions to be based on shared decision-making (SDM) clinician professional judgment, and patient preferences. However, evidence suggests that SDM is underutilized in clinical practice, especially among the most vulnerable patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a community health worker (CHW)-led decision-coaching program to facilitate SDM for prostate cancer screening among Black men in the primary care setting, with the ultimate aim of improving/optimizing decision quality.  Methods:   We proposed a CHW-led decision-coaching program to facilitate SDM for prostate cancer screening discussions in Black men at a primary care FQHC. This study enrolled Black men who were patients at the participating clinical site and up to 15 providers who cared for them. We estimated to recruit 228 participants, ages 40-69 to be randomized to either (1) a decision aid along with decision coaching on PSA screening from a CHW or (2) receiving a decision aid along with CHW-led interaction on modifying dietary and lifestyle to serve as an attention control. The independent randomization process was implemented within each provider and we controlled for age by dividing patients into two strata: 40-54 years and 55-69 years. This sample size sufficiently powered the detection differences in the primary study outcomes: knowledge, indicative of decision quality, and differences in PSA screening rates. Primary outcome measures for patients will be decision quality and decision regarding whether to undergo PSA screening. Primary outcome measures for providers will be acceptability and feasibility of the intervention. We will examine how decision coaching about prostate cancer screening impact patient-provider communication. These outcomes will be analyzed quantitatively through objective, validated scales and qualitatively through semi-structured, in-depth interviews, and thematic analysis of clinical encounters. Through a conceptual model combining elements of the Preventative Health Care Model (PHM) and Informed Decision-Making Model, we hypothesize that the prostate cancer screening decision coaching intervention will result in a preference-congruent decision and decisional satisfaction. We also hypothesize that this intervention will improve physician satisfaction with counseling patients about prostate cancer screening.  Discussion:   Decision coaching is an evidence-based approach to improve decision quality in many clinical contexts, but its efficacy is incompletely explored for PSA screening among Black men in primary care. Our proposal to evaluate a CHW-led decision-coaching program for PSA screening has high potential for scalability and public health impact. Our results will determine the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability of a CHW intervention in a community clinic setting in order to inform subsequent widespread dissemination, a critical research area highlighted by USPSTF.

In this study, we aimed to outline patterns of failure in a group of post-prostatectomy patients who received adjuvant or salvage radiation therapy (PORT) and subsequently experienced biochemical recurrence, using 18F-PSMA PET/CT and mpMRI.  Methods:   PCa patients with biochemical failure post-prostatectomy, and no evident site of recurrence on conventional imaging, were enrolled on two prospective trials of first and second generation 18F-PSMA PET agents (18F-DCFBC and 18F-DCFPyL) in combination with MRI between October 2014 and December 2018. The primary aim of our study is to characterize these lesions with respect to their location relative to previous PORT field and received dose.  Results:   A total of 34 participants underwent 18F-PSMA PET imaging for biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy and PORT, with 32/34 found to have 18F-PSMA avid lesions. On 18F-PSMA, 17/32 patients (53.1%) had metastatic disease, 8/32 (25.0%) patients had locoregional recurrences, and 7/32 (21.9%) had local failure in the prostate fossa. On further exploration, we noted 6/7 (86%) of prostate fossa recurrences were in-field and were encompassed by 100% isodose lines, receiving 64.8-72 Gy. One patient had marginal failure encompassed by the 49 Gy isodose.  Conclusions: 18F-PSMA PET imaging demonstrates promise in identifying occult PCa recurrence after PORT.

This process is linked to the acquisition of an invasive phenotype and the formation of distant metastases. The development of compounds that block the acquisition of an invasive phenotype or revert the invasive mesenchymal phenotype into a more differentiated epithelial phenotype represent a promising anticancer strategy. In a high-throughput assay based on E-cadherin (re)induction and the inhibition of tumor cell invasion, 44,475 low molecular weight (LMW) compounds were screened. The screening resulted in the identification of candidate compounds from the PROAM02 class. Selected LMW compounds activated E-cadherin promoter activity and inhibited cancer cell invasion in multiple metastatic human cancer cell lines. The intraperitoneal administration of selected LMW compounds reduced the tumor burden in human prostate and breast cancer in vivo mouse models. Moreover, selected LMW compounds decreased the intra-bone growth of xenografted human prostate cancer cells. This study describes the identification of the PROAM02 class of small molecules that can be exploited to reduce cancer cell invasion and metastases.

Recent clinical trials with upfront treatment of ADT combined with chemotherapy or novel hormonal therapies (NHTs) have extended overall patient survival. These results indicate that there is significant potential for the optimization of standard-of-care therapies to delay the emergence of progressive metastatic disease.  Methods:   Here, we used data extracted from human bone metastatic biopsies pre- and post-abiraterone acetate/prednisone to generate a mathematical model of bone metastatic prostate cancer that can unravel the treatment impact on disease progression. Intra-tumor heterogeneity in regard to ADT and chemotherapy resistance was derived from biopsy data at a cellular level, permitting the model to track the dynamics of resistant phenotypes in response to treatment from biological first-principles without relying on data fitting. These cellular data were mathematically correlated with a clinical proxy for tumor burden, utilizing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) production as an example.  Results:   Using this correlation, our model recapitulated the individual patient response to applied treatments in a separate and independent cohort of patients (n = 24), and was able to estimate the initial resistance to the ADT of each patient. Combined with an intervention-decision algorithm informed by patient-specific prediction of initial resistance, we propose to optimize the sequence of treatments for each patient with the goal of delaying the evolution of resistant disease and limit cancer cell growth, offering evidence for an improvement against retrospective data.  Conclusions:   Our results show how minimal but widely available patient information can be used to model and track the progression of BMPCa in real time, offering a clinically relevant insight into the patient-specific evolutionary dynamics of the disease and suggesting new therapeutic options for intervention.

Methods:   Consecutive patients with a 3 T multiparametric prostate MRI (mpMRI) and a subsequent MRI/US fusion-guided TB plus 12-core US-guided SB from 01/2014 to 04/2019 were included in this study. Primary study endpoint was the analysis of cases with a csPCa missed by TB and detected by SB. Secondary study objectives were the PCa detection and the correlation with clinical and MRI parameters.  Results:   In total 785 patients met the inclusion criteria. 342 patients had a csPCa (median PSAD 0.29 ng/mL/cm3). In 42 patients (13 %), a csPCa was detected only by SB. In 36 of these cases, the localization of the positive SB cores matched with the cancer suspicious region described on mpMRI (mCSR). Cases with a csPCA missed by TB showed either an insufficient MRI segmentation (prostate boundary correlation) (31 %) and/or insufficient lesion registration (lesion transfer, tracking, and/or matching) (48 %), a missed small lesion (14 %), or a failed center of a large lesion (10 %). Median PSAD of patients with non-significant PCa detected by SB was 0.15 ng/mL/cm3.  Conclusions:   Main reasons for missing a csPCa by TB were insufficient prostate segmentation or imprecise lesion registration within MRI/US fusion-guided biopsy.

Finding new synthetic lethal (SL) interactions with RB1 could lead to new approaches to treating cancers with inactivated RB1. We identified 95 SL partners of RB1 based on a Drosophila screen for genetic modifiers of the eye phenotype caused by defects in the RB1 ortholog, Rbf1. We validated 38 mammalian orthologs of Rbf1 modifiers as RB1 SL partners in human cancer cell lines with defective RB1 alleles. We further show that for many of the RB1 SL genes validated in human cancer cell lines, low activity of the SL gene in human tumors, when concurrent with low levels of RB1 was associated with improved patient survival. We investigated higher order combinatorial gene interactions by creating a novel Drosophila cancer model with co-occurring Rbf1, Pten and Ras mutations, and found that targeting RB1 SL genes in this background suppressed the dramatic tumor growth and rescued fly survival whilst having minimal effects on wild-type cells. Finally, we found that drugs targeting the identified RB1 interacting genes/pathways, such as UNC3230, PYR-41, TAK-243, isoginkgetin, madrasin, and celastrol also elicit SL in human cancer cell lines.

The data of 153 mCRPC patients received docetaxel followed by ADT were retrospectively reviewed. Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that TTN (overall survival (OS): Hazard ratio [HR] 0.096, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.045-0.206, p < .001; progression-free survival (PFS): HR 0.128, 95% CI 0.078-0.211, p < .001) and nPSA (OS: HR 2.849, 95% CI 1.318-6.157, p = .008; PFS: HR 1.573, 95% CI 1.008-2.454, p = .046) acted as independent predictors of chemotherapy prognosis. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with nPSA ≥ 0.2 ng/ml or TTN < 6.5 months had shorter OS and PFS. These results suggest that TTN and nPSA during ADT can affect the prognosis of docetaxel-based chemotherapy prognosis post-castration resistance in patients with mCRPC, and higher nPSA and shorter TTN lead to poor chemotherapy prognosis.

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed our multi-institutional database to identify 2492 patients. SII was calculated as platelet count × neutrophil/lymphocyte count and evaluated at a cutoff of 485. Logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the association of SII with muscle-invasive and non-organ-confined (NOC) disease. Cox regression analyses were performed to investigate the association of SII with recurrence-free, cancer-specific, and overall survival (RFS/CSS/OS).  Results:   Overall, 986 (41.6%) patients had an SII > 485. On univariable logistic regression analyses, SII > 485 was associated with a higher risk of muscle-invasive (P = 0.004) and NOC (P = 0.03) disease at RNU. On multivariable logistic regression, SII remained independently associated with muscle-invasive disease (P = 0.01). On univariable Cox regression analyses, SII > 485 was associated with shorter RFS (P = 0.002), CSS (P = 0.002) and OS (P = 0.004). On multivariable Cox regression analyses SII remained independently associated with survival outcomes (all P < 0.05). Addition of SII to the multivariable models improved their discrimination of the models for predicting muscle-invasive disease (P = 0.02). However, all area under the curve and C-indexes increased by < 0.02 and it did not improve net benefit on decision curve analysis.  Conclusions:   Preoperative altered SII is significantly associated with higher pathologic stages and worse survival outcomes in patients treated with RNU for UTUC.

Cancer pathways are designed to give patients and their relatives a predictable and as stress-free as possible treatment trajectory and minimise waiting time.  Design:   Qualitative, explorative research design.  Methods:   Focus groups with 16 prostate cancer survivors after having participated in an educational programme. The COREQ checklist was followed to ensure rigour in the study.  Results:   The main theme, 'Help me stay in control', and three subthemes, 'To be met with interest and support, enough knowledge to understand what is happening and a plan to build the new life on', emerged from qualitative analysis and highlighted the participants' need for information and support, specially scheduled at critical times in the treatment trajectory: the diagnostic phase, the treatment phase and the life after treatment. They also highlighted the need for empathy and interest from healthcare professionals and highlighted the need for arenas to discuss vulnerable topics. Contact with peers was perceived as supportive and encouraging.  Conclusion:   Healthcare professionals must support prostate cancer survivors with empathy, interest and information tailored to their needs in three different phases.

Hispidulin (4',5,7-trihydroxy-6-methoxyflavone) is a phenolic flavonoid compound proved to possess anticancer properties, but its effects on PCa are left to be released. The aims of this study were to investigate the effects and the relative mechanisms of Hispidulin on PCa development. Hispidulin administration inhibited proliferation, invasion, and migration, while accelerated apoptosis in Du145 and VCaP cells, which was accompanied by PPARγ activation and autophagy enhancement.

Evidence of EV presence in biological fluids has led to considerable efforts focused on identifying their cargo and determining their utility as a non-invasive diagnostic platform for cancer. In this study, we identify circulating STEAP1 (six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 1)-positive EVs in the plasma of healthy males and prostate cancer patients and evaluate its diagnostic and prognostic significance.  Methods:   STEAP1 was identified on EVs in prostate cancer patient plasma. EVs were validated using electron microscopy, Western blot, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and nanoscale flow cytometry. STEAP1-positive EVs were quantified for 121 males with prostate cancer and 55 healthy age-matched control males. An evaluation of STEAP1 in prostate cancer tissue was also performed using established prostate cancer cohort data (TCGA, MSKCC, and SU2C/PCF Dream Team).  Results:   Evaluation of STEAP1-positive EVs by nanoscale flow cytometry identified a significant increase in prostate cancer patient plasma compared to healthy males. However, no association was found between total STEAP1 EV levels and disease recurrence or overall survival. Cohort data from prostate cancer tissue also found STEAP1 to be elevated in prostate cancer while no significant association with recurrence or overall survival was identified.  Conclusions:   STEAP1 is known to be enriched on the cells of the prostate with potential clinical significance in prostate cancer.

Differential expression of lncRNAs and microRNA prostate cancer cells were predicted by informatics and confirmed by qRT-PCR. SChLAP1-interacting proteins were characterized by RNA pull-down combined with western blotting, which was verified using RIP and qPCR analysis. Then ChIP assay and DNA pull-down were used to validate the binding of DNMT3a and HEK27me3 with miRNA gene promoters. Target genes of miRNAs were bioinformatically predicted and validated by dual-luciferase reporter assays. The tumorigenicity of prostate cancer cells was assessed using the cancer cell line-based xenograft (CDX) model. We found that SChLAP1 expression was significantly elevated in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines, which was negatively correlated with miR-340 expression. SChLAP1 directly binds with EZH2 and repressed multiple miRNA expression on chromosome 5 including the miR-340-3p in prostate cancer cells through recruiting H3K27me3 to mediate promoter methylation modification of miR-340-5p/miR-143-3p/miR-145-5p to suppress gene transcription. Moreover, DNMT3a was one of the common target genes of miR-340-5p/miR-143-3p/miR-145-5p in prostate cancer cells. And SChLAP1/EZH2 could also promote prostate cancer tumor development via the interaction of microRNA-DNMT3a signaling pathways in xenograft nude mice.

Tumor-resident immune cells have been detected in the prostate, but the regulatory mechanisms that govern tumor infiltration are still poorly understood. To address this gap, we investigated the role of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome candidate 1 (WHSC1), a histone methyltransferase enzyme that targets dimethyl and trimethyl H3K36. WHSC1 is known to promote malignant growth and progression in multiple tumors, but its role in the interface between PCa and immune system is unknown.  Methods:   RNA Sequencing (RNASeq) data from patients with PCa from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were collected and divided into top/bottom 30% based on the expression of WHSC1 and disease-free survival was calculated. Publicly available chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIPSeq) data were obtained from Cistrome and integrated with the available RNASeq data. RNASeq, ATACSeq and methylomic were analyzed using R Bioconductor packages comparing C42 cells with or without stable knockdown on WHSC1. Flow cytometry was used to measure Major Histocompatibility complex (MHC) levels, MHC-bound ovalbumin and tumor infiltration. C57B6 and NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice were subcutaneously grafted with TRansgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) C2 cells and treated with MCTP39 (10 mg/kg); tumor size was monitored over time and curves were compared using permutation analyses. All analyses used a significance threshold of 0.05.  Results:   Leveraging TCGA data, we demonstrated that elevated WHSC1 levels positively correlate with the presence of an immunosuppressive microenvironment. We validated those results in vitro, demonstrating that genetic and pharmacological inhibition of WHSC1 restores antigen presentation. This occurs via an elegant epigenetic regulation of gene expression at the chromatin and DNA methylation levels. In vivo studies in immunocompetent mice also show an increased frequency of CD8+ T cells in tumors from mice treated with WHSC1 inhibitor, supporting the hypothesis that the antitumor effect following WHSC1 inhibition requires a fully functional immune system.  Conclusions:   This study demonstrates a novel role for WHSC1 in defining immune infiltration in PCa, with significant future implications for the use of immunotherapies in prostate malignancies.""","""['Muzamil Y Want', 'Takemasa Tsuji', 'Prashant K Singh', 'James L Thorne', 'Junko Matsuzaki', 'Ellen Karasik', 'Bryan Gillard', 'Eduardo Cortes Gomez', 'Richard C Koya', 'Amit Lugade', 'Kunle Odunsi', 'Sebastiano Battaglia']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Immunother Cancer""","""['Inhibition of WHSC1 Allows for Reprogramming of the Immune Compartment in Prostate Cancer.', 'Epigenetic activation of WHSC1 functions as an oncogene and is associated with poor prognosis in cervical cancer.', 'Histone lysine methyltransferase Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome candidate 1 is involved in human carcinogenesis through regulation of the Wnt pathway.', 'NSD2 as a Promising Target in Hematological Disorders.', 'Developmental delay and failure to thrive associated with a loss-of-function variant in WHSC1 (NSD2).', 'WHSC1 is involved in DNA damage, cellular senescence and immune response in hepatocellular carcinoma progression.', 'The Immunotherapy and Immunosuppressive Signaling in Therapy-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'The role of NSD1, NSD2, and NSD3 histone methyltransferases in solid tumors.', 'Histone methyltransferase WHSC1 loss dampens MHC-I antigen presentation pathway to impair IFN-γ-stimulated antitumor immunity.', 'Inhibition of WHSC1 Allows for Reprogramming of the Immune Compartment in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Design:   Retrospective, population based diagnostic evaluation.  Participants:   49 908 people recruited to the UK Biobank with SNP chip and next generation sequencing data, and an additional 21 people who purchased consumer genetic tests and shared their data online via the Personal Genome Project.  Main outcome measures:   Genotyping (that is, identification of the correct DNA base at a specific genomic location) using SNP chips versus sequencing, with results split by frequency of that genotype in the population. Rare pathogenic variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were selected as an exemplar for detailed analysis of clinically actionable variants in the UK Biobank, and BRCA related cancers (breast, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic) were assessed in participants through use of cancer registry data.  Results:   Overall, genotyping using SNP chips performed well compared with sequencing; sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were all above 99% for 108 574 common variants directly genotyped on the SNP chips and sequenced in the UK Biobank. However, the likelihood of a true positive result decreased dramatically with decreasing variant frequency; for variants that are very rare in the population, with a frequency below 0.001% in UK Biobank, the positive predictive value was very low and only 16% of 4757 heterozygous genotypes from the SNP chips were confirmed with sequencing data. Results were similar for SNP chip data from the Personal Genome Project, and 20/21 individuals analysed had at least one false positive rare pathogenic variant that had been incorrectly genotyped. For pathogenic variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which are individually very rare, the overall performance metrics for the SNP chips versus sequencing in the UK Biobank were: sensitivity 34.6%, specificity 98.3%, positive predictive value 4.2%, and negative predictive value 99.9%. Rates of BRCA related cancers in UK Biobank participants with a positive SNP chip result were similar to those for age matched controls (odds ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 0.99 to 1.71) because the vast majority of variants were false positives, whereas sequence positive participants had a significantly increased risk (odds ratio 4.05, 2.72 to 6.03).

This study was primarily designed to evaluate the trajectories of cognitive performance in patients with prostate cancer, and to quantify the impact of the disease and its treatments on the occurrence of cognitive decline.  Methods:   Participants will be recruited from two main hospitals providing care to approximately half of the patients with prostate cancer in Northern Portugal (Portuguese Institute of Oncology of Porto and São João Hospital Centre), and will comprise a cohort of recently diagnosed patients with prostate cancer proposed for different treatment plans, including: (1) radical prostatectomy; (2) brachytherapy and/or radiotherapy; (3) radiotherapy in combination with androgen deprivation therapy and (4) androgen deprivation therapy (with or without chemotherapy). Recruitment began in February 2018 and is expected to continue until the first semester of 2021. Follow-up evaluations will be conducted at 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years. Sociodemographic, behavioural and clinical characteristics, anxiety and depression, health literacy, health status, quality of life, and sleep quality will be assessed. Blood pressure and anthropometrics will be measured, and a fasting blood sample will be collected. Participants' cognitive performance will be evaluated before treatments and throughout follow-up (Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Cube Test as well as Brain on Track for remote monitoring). All participants suspected of cognitive impairment will undergo neuropsychological tests and clinical observation by a neurologist.

Methods:   To systematically determine CK18 expression in normal and cancerous tissues, 11,952 tumor samples from 115 different tumor types and subtypes (including carcinomas, mesenchymal and biphasic tumors) as well as 608 samples of 76 different normal tissue types were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in a tissue microarray format.  Results:   CK18 was expressed in normal epithelial cells of most organs but absent in normal squamous epithelium. At least an occasional weak CK18 positivity was seen in 90 of 115 (78.3%) tumor types. Wide-spread CK18 positivity was seen in 37 (31.9%) of tumor entities, including adenocarcinomas of the lung, prostate, colon and pancreas as well as ovarian cancer. Tumor categories with variable CK18 immunostaining included cancer types arising from CK18 positive precursor cells but show CK18 downregulation in a fraction of cases, tumor types arising from CK18 negative precursor cells occasionally exhibiting CK18 neo-expression, tumors derived from normal tissues with variable CK18 expression, and tumors with a mixed differentiation. CK18 downregulation was for example seen in renal cell cancers and breast cancers, whereas CK18 neo-expression was found in squamous cell carcinomas of various origins. Down-regulation of CK18 in invasive breast carcinomas of no special type and clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC) was related to adverse tumor features in both tumors (p ≤ 0.0001) and poor patient prognosis in ccRCC (p = 0.0088). Up-regulation of CK18 in squamous cell carcinomas was linked to high grade and lymph node metastasis (p < 0.05). In summary, CK18 is consistently expressed in various epithelial cancers, especially adenocarcinomas.

A 2 mm threshold for selecting patients for replanning shows no difference in the reduction of the clinical margin, but reduces the workload with 12%.  Conclusion:   An ART strategy based on adapting on the average IVM during the initial 5 fractions of treatment provides an opportunity to reduce the CTV to PTV margins in postoperative gynecological tumors. To keep the workload in balance with the best achievable margin reduction, a threshold for selecting patients for plan adaptation is recommended.""","""['Monica Buijs', 'Monique C W M Bloemers', 'Peter Remeijer']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Adaptive radiotherapy and the dosimetric impact of inter- and intrafractional motion on the planning target volume for prostate cancer patients.', 'Fast online replanning for interfraction rotation correction in prostate radiotherapy.', 'Role of image-guided patient repositioning and online planning in localized prostate cancer IMRT.', 'Image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy of prostate cancer: Analysis of interfractional errors and acute toxicity.', 'Determination of optimal planning target volume margins in patients with gynecological cancer.', 'Fan beam CT-guided online adaptive external radiotherapy of uterine cervical cancer: a dosimetric evaluation.']"""

Material and methods:   Three sublines (AT1, HI, H) of syngeneic rat prostate tumors (R3327) were treated with six fractions of either 12C-ions or 6 MV photons. Dose-response curves were determined for the endpoint local tumor control within 300 days. The doses at 50% control probability (TCD50) and the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of 12C-ions were calculated and compared with the values from single and split dose studies.  Results:   Experimental findings for the three tumor sublines revealed (i) a comparably increased RBE (2.47-2.67), (ii) a much smaller variation of the radiation response for 12C-ions (TCD50: 35.8-43.7 Gy) than for photons (TCD50: 91.3-116.6 Gy), (iii) similarly steep (AT1) or steeper (HI, H) dose-response curves for 12C-ions than for photons, (iv) a larger fractionation effect for photons than for 12C-ions, and (v) a steeper increase of the RBE with decreasing fractional dose for the well-differentiated H- than for the less-differentiated HI- and AT1-tumors, reflected by (vi) the smallest α/β-value for H-tumors after photon irradiation.  Conclusion: 12C-ions reduce the radiation response heterogeneity between the three tumor sublines as well as within each subline relative to photon treatments, independently of fractionation. The dose dependence of the RBE varies between tumors of different histology.

Methods Cross-sectional data were collected from adult patients living in four regional/rural areas and two outer metropolitan regions in Western Australia who had been diagnosed with breast, prostate, colorectal or lung cancer. Consenting participants were mailed demographic and financial questionnaires, and requested to report all OOPE related to their cancer treatment. Results The median total OOPE reported by 308 regional/rural participants and 119 outer metropolitan participants were A$1518 (interquartile range (IQR): A$581-A$3769) and A$2855 (IQR: A$958-A$7142) respectively. Participants most likely to experience higher total OOPE were younger than 65 years of age, male, resided in the outer metropolitan area, worked prior to diagnosis, had private health insurance, were in a relationship, and underwent surgery. Multivariate analysis of regional/rural participants revealed that receiving care at a rural cancer centre was associated with significantly lower non-medical OOPE (estimated mean A$805, 95% confidence interval (CI): A$735-A$875, P=0.038; compared with other rural participants (A$1347, 95% CI: A$743-A$1951, P<0.001)). Conclusion The cancer patients who participated in this study experienced variation in OOPE, with outer metropolitan participants reporting higher OOPE compared with their regional/rural counterparts. There is a need for cost transparency and access to care close to home, so that patients can make informed choices about where to receive their care. What is known about the topic? In recent years, OOPE for health care in general and cancer in particular have been widely debated by consumers and not-for-profit organisations; the topic has attracted much political attention because it affects both equity and access to care and has wider financial implications for the community. Research studies and reports from both consumer organisations and a Ministerial Advisory Committee found that cancer patients can face exorbitant out-of-pocket costs, and that individuals with private health insurance and those with prostate and breast cancer reported higher costs. In Western Australia, a cancer centre providing comprehensive cancer care was established in the second most populous region to ameliorate the high costs for travel and accommodation that regional cancer patients are known to experience. What does this paper add? This study is unique because it collected detailed cost information from patients and reports on the OOPE of regional/rural and outer metropolitan Western Australian patients receiving care for one of the four most common cancers; it therefore offers novel insight into the experiences of these groups. This study demonstrates that outer metropolitan cancer patients are experiencing much higher OOPE compared with regional/rural cancer patients. Additionally, regional/rural study participants who accessed a Regional Cancer Centre experienced significantly lower non-medical OOPE, compared with regional/rural study participants receiving care elsewhere. What are the implications for practitioners? First, there is a need for improved communication of OOPE to minimise costs to the patient, for example, by facilitating access to local cancer care. Health service providers and insurance companies can improve cost transparency for cancer patients by making this information more readily available, allowing patients to make informed financial choices about where to seek care. Second, the needs of working patients deserve specific attention. These patients face significant work uncertainty and additional distress following a cancer diagnosis.""","""['Neli S Slavova-Azmanova', 'Jade C Newton', 'Claire E Johnson', 'Harry Hohnen', 'Angela Ives', 'Sandy McKiernan', 'Violet Platt', 'Max Bulsara', 'Christobel Saunders']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Aust Health Rev""","""['Out-of-pocket expenses experienced by rural Western Australians diagnosed with cancer.', ""'Biggest factors in having cancer were costs and no entitlement to compensation'-The determinants of out-of-pocket costs for cancer care through the lenses of rural and outer metropolitan Western Australians."", ""'…If I don't have that sort of money again, what happens?': adapting a qualitative model to conceptualise the consequences of out-of-pocket expenses for cancer patients in mixed health systems."", 'Australian Experiences of Out-of-Pocket Costs and Financial Burden Following a Cancer Diagnosis: A Systematic Review.', 'Out-of-pocket expenses related to aging in place for frail older people: a scoping review.', 'Out-of-pocket medical expenditure and associated factors of advanced colorectal cancer in China: a multi-center cross-sectional study.']"""

However, there are limited data on its use and effectiveness among patients with active cancer presenting with STEMI.  Methods and results:   All STEMI hospitalizations between 2004 and 2015 from the National Inpatient Sample were retrospectively analysed, stratified by cancer type. Propensity score matching was performed to estimate the average treatment effect of pPCI in each cancer on in-hospital adverse events, including major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) and its individual components, and compare treatment effect between cancer and non-cancer patients. Out of 1 870 815 patients with STEMI, 38 932 (2.1%) had a current cancer diagnosis [haematological: 11 251 (28.9% of all cancers); breast: 4675 (12.0%); lung: 9538 (24.5%); colon: 3749 (9.6%); prostate: 9719 (25.0%)]. Patients with cancer received pPCI less commonly than those without cancer (from 54.2% for lung cancer to 70.6% for haematological vs. 82.3% in no cancer). Performance of pPCI was strongly associated with lower adjusted probabilities of MACCE and all-cause mortality in the cancer groups compared with the no cancer group. There was no significant difference in estimated average pPCI treatment effect between the cancer groups and non-cancer group.  Conclusion:   Primary percutaneous coronary intervention is underutilized in STEMI patients with current cancer despite its significantly lower associated rates of in-hospital all-cause mortality and MACCE that is comparable to patients without cancer.

Methods:   Thirty-five men with low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer who underwent rectal hydrogel spacer placement and pre-, post-spacer prostate MRI studies were treated with prostate SBRT (36.25 Gy in five fractions). A prostate radiologist contoured the NVB on both the pre- and post-spacer T2W MRI sequences that were then registered to the CT simulation scan for NVB-sparing radiation treatment planning. Three SBRT treatment plans were developed for each patient: (1) no NVB sparing, (2) NVB-sparing using pre-spacer MRI, and (3) NVB-sparing using post-spacer MRI. NVB dose constraints include maximum dose 36.25 Gy (100%), V34.4 Gy (95% of dose) <60%, V32Gy <70%, V28Gy <90%.  Results:   Rectal hydrogel spacer placement shifted NVB contours an average of 3.1 ± 3.4 mm away from the prostate, resulting in a 10% decrease in NVB V34.4 Gy in non-NVB-sparing plans (p < 0.01). NVB-sparing treatment planning reduced the NVB V34.4 by 16% without the spacer (p < 0.01) and 25% with spacer (p < 0.001). NVB-sparing did not compromise PTV coverage and OAR endpoints.  Conclusions:   NVB-sparing SBRT with rectal hydrogel spacer significantly reduces the volume of NVB treated with high-dose radiation. Rectal spacer contributes to this effect through a dosimetrically meaningful displacement of the NVB that may significantly reduce RiED. These results suggest that NVB-sparing SBRT warrants further clinical evaluation.

The fact that advanced PCa shows strong ApoA-I expression reflects its potential role in driving therapeutic resistance and disease progression by reprogramming the lipid metabolic network of tumor cells. Molecularly, ApoA-I is regulated by MYC, a frequently amplified oncogene in late-stage PCa.

Androgen receptor (AR) signaling is essential for PCa cell growth/survival and remains a key therapeutic target for lethal castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). GATA2 is a pioneer transcription factor crucial for inducing AR expression/activation. We recently reported that MAPK4, an atypical MAPK, promotes tumor progression via noncanonical activation of AKT. Here, we demonstrated that MAPK4 activated AR by enhancing GATA2 transcriptional expression and stabilizing GATA2 protein through repression of GATA2 ubiquitination/degradation. MAPK4 expression correlated with AR activation in human CRPC. Concerted activation of both GATA2/AR and AKT by MAPK4 promoted PCa cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, xenograft growth, and castration resistance. Conversely, knockdown of MAPK4 decreased activation of both AR and AKT and inhibited PCa cell and xenograft growth, including castration-resistant growth. Both GATA2/AR and AKT activation were necessary for MAPK4 tumor-promoting activity. Interestingly, combined overexpression of GATA2 plus a constitutively activated AKT was sufficient to drive PCa growth and castration resistance, shedding light on an alternative, MAPK4-independent tumor-promoting pathway in human PCa. We concluded that MAPK4 promotes PCa growth and castration resistance by cooperating parallel pathways of activating GATA2/AR and AKT and that MAPK4 is a novel therapeutic target in PCa, especially CRPC.""","""['Tao Shen', 'Wei Wang', 'Wolong Zhou', 'Ilsa Coleman', 'Qinbo Cai', 'Bingning Dong', 'Michael M Ittmann', 'Chad J Creighton', 'Yingnan Bian', 'Yanling Meng', 'David R Rowley', 'Peter S Nelson', 'David D Moore', 'Feng Yang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Clin Invest""","""['A COP1-GATA2 axis suppresses AR signaling and prostate cancer.', 'MAPK4 overexpression promotes tumor progression via noncanonical activation of AKT/mTOR signaling.', 'Combination of carmustine and selenite effectively inhibits tumor growth by targeting androgen receptor, androgen receptor-variants, and Akt in preclinical models: New hope for patients with castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Cooperative activation of PDK1 and AKT by MAPK4 enhances cancer growth and resistance to therapy.', 'DeeP4med: deep learning for P4 medicine to predict normal and cancer transcriptome in multiple human tissues.', 'MAPK4 predicts poor prognosis and facilitates the proliferation and migration of glioma through the AKT/mTOR pathway.', 'Identification of a novel senescence-associated signature to predict biochemical recurrence and immune microenvironment for prostate cancer.', 'Addressing the Reciprocal Crosstalk between the AR and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling Pathways for Prostate Cancer Treatment.']"""

A video scoring system consisting of 8 items was developed in accordance with the technical details described in the literature. Video scores were categorized into 3 groups, namely as 'poor', 'moderate; or 'good' in terms of their contribution to surgical education. The first 300 videos were evaluated for the search results for 'blepharoplasty'. After exclusion and summarization of video fragments, a total number of 36 videos were included in the study. Multivariable logistic regression models found no correlation between likes, views, comments and the attributed educational score.

In such interventions, treatment planning can be a challenging task and requires experience and skills of the planner. We developed a novel knowledge-based (KB) optimization method based on previous treatment plans. The purpose of this method was to generate clinically acceptable plans that do not require extensive manual adjustments in clinical scenarios.  Methods:   Objective functions used in current inverse planning methods are preferably based on spatial invariant dose objectives rather than spatial dose distributions. Therefore, they are prone to return suboptimal plans resulting in time consuming plan adjustments. To overcome this limitation, a KB approach is introduced. The KB model uses the dose distributions of previous clinical plans projected onto a standardized geometry. From those standardized distributions a template plan is generated. The treatment plans were optimized with an in-house developed planning system by solving a constraint inverse optimization problem that mimics the projected template dose plan constraint to DVH metrics. The method is benchmarked under an IRB-approved retrospective study by comparing optimization time, dosimetric performance, and clinical acceptability against current clinical practice. The quality of the KB model is evaluated with a Turing test.  Results:   The KB model consists of five high-quality treatment plans. Those plans were selected by one of our experts and showed all desired dosimetric features. After generating the model treatment plans were created with one run of the optimizer for the remaining 20 patients. The optimization time including needle optimization ranged from 6 to 29 s. Based on a Wilcoxon signed rank test the new plans are dosimetrically equivalent to current clinical practice. The Turing test showed that the proposed method generates plans that are equivalent to current clinical practice and that the dose prediction drives the optimization to achieve high-quality treatment plans.  Conclusions:   This study demonstrated that the proposed KB model was able to capture user-specific features in isodose lines which can be used to generate acceptable treatment plans with a single run of the optimization engine in under a minute. This could potentially reduce the time in the operating room and the time a patient is under anesthesia.""","""['Christian V Guthier', 'Peter F Orio rd', 'Ivan Buzurovic', 'Robert A Cormack']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Investigating the role of constrained CVT and CVT in HIPO inverse planning for HDR brachytherapy of prostate cancer.', 'A fast inverse treatment planning strategy facilitating optimized catheter selection in image-guided high-dose-rate interstitial gynecologic brachytherapy.', 'Inverse planning optimization for hybrid prostate permanent-seed implant brachytherapy plans using two source strengths.', 'Optimization in treatment planning of high dose-rate brachytherapy - Review and analysis of mathematical models.', 'The evolution of computerized treatment planning for brachytherapy: American contributions.']"""

Methods:   One hundred twenty-one prostate cancer patients who underwent 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT between January 2018 and December 2019 were included. Imaging was conducted for staging upon new diagnosis with moderate- and high-risk disease and for confirming the progression of castration resistance. The relationships between the Wbv 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT parameters and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, PSA doubling time and Gleason score (GS) were evaluated.  Results:   The median GS and mean PSA levels were similar between the castration-naive and resistant patients. The PSA levels were positively correlated with MTVwb (p: 0.009, r: 0.286) and TLPwb (p: 0.002, r: 0.344). Gleason scores were positively correlated with MTVwb (p: 0.050, r: 0.216), TLPwb (p: 0.007, r: 0.296) and highest standard uptake value (HSUV) max (p: 0.047, r: 0.220). In the castration-naive group, Gleason scores (from p < 0.001 to p = 0.04 and r = 0.331 to 0.549) and PSA levels (from p = 0.002 to p = 0.045 and from r = 0.323 to 0.473) correlated with all 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT parameters. PSA doubling time was negatively correlated with whole-body metabolic tumour volume (MTVwb) (p: 0.050, r: 0.232) and whole-body total lesion PSMA (TLPwb) (p: 0.026, r: 0.262).

Conclusions:   Wbv 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT results were correlated with PSA levels and Gleason scores. The correlation was relatively stronger in the castration-naive group.

It enables us to give high tumoral radiation doses while resulting in lower absorbed radiation to critical organs. However, the factors which influence this effect are yet to be defined. In this study, we have investigated the predictive factors of the tumor sink effect in a group of patients who received 177Lu-Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) therapy due to progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Methods:   We have retrospectively analyzed the pre-therapy 68Ga-PSMA positron-emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) and post-therapy planar whole-body scans of 65 patients who received at least two cycles of 7.4 GBq of 177Lu-PSMA therapy. All patients with mCRPC were referred to our department after multiple treatment lines. Age, previous therapies, International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) score, and pre-therapy serum tumor marker levels were recorded. Post 177Lu-PSMA therapy images were analyzed for TSE. 68Ga-PSMA PET-CT images were used for the calculation of SUVmax in malignant and healthy tissues as well as metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion PSMA index (TLPI).  Results:   Based on the post-therapy scans, TSE was seen in 17/65 (26.2%) patients. In univariate analysis, patients with TSE had higher pre-therapy PSA, PSA velocity, and ALP (p < 0.0001). In relation to PET parameters, patients with TSE had higher 68Ga-PSMA MTV, 68Ga-PSMA TLPI and lower pretherapy renal SUVmax (p < 0.0001)), pretherapy liver SUVmax (p:0.012), pretherapy parotid gland SUVmax (p:0.032), and pretherapy parotid gland SUVmean (p:0.038). In the multivariant analysis, 68Ga-PSMA TLPI, pre-therapy PSA, and PSA velocity were found to be statistically significant. When analyzed according to Youden index, pretherapy PSA level of 133 ng/ml (sensitivity 0.765 and 0.875), PSA velocity of 246 ng/ml/year (sensitivity 0.765 and 0.833), and 68Ga-PSMA TLPI of 2969 g (sensitivity 0.765 and 0.875) was found to be the best cut-off points to predict TSE.  Conclusion:   The tumor sink effect was seen in 26.2% of patients. 68Ga- PSMA TLPI, pre-therapy PSA, and PSA velocity was found to be the predictors of TSE. Accurate prediction of TSE may lead to increased tumoral doses while sparing healthy organs.

Herein, we report a series of de novo PCA-NT focusing on characteristic morphologic, immunophenotypic and clinical features. Treatment naïve PCA-NT were identified. IHC for PSA, NKX3.1, Chromogranin, Synaptophysin, Cyclin D1, RB and Ki67 were performed. Radiology, treatment and follow-up data were reviewed. Sixteen patients were included. Apart from focal areas of high-grade prostate cancer with acinar features (reminiscent of Grade Group 5 disease), extensive areas with sheets of cells with deep amphophilic/basophilic cytoplasm, enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei with granular chromatin and inconspicuous to prominent nucleoli with high mitotic activity were identified. Immunohistochemistry showed patchy NKX3.1, patchy PSA, variable Synaptophysin and Chromogranin; RB and CyclinD1 showed loss of expression. Ki67 showed high proliferative index, in most cases. Adverse radiologic findings and metastases were documented in most cases. Two patients died of disease.

Functional analyses in vitro showed that GHSROS mediates tumor growth, migration and survival, and resistance to the cytotoxic drug docetaxel. Increased cellular proliferation of GHSROS-overexpressing PC3, DU145, and LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines in vitro was recapitulated in a subcutaneous xenograft model. Conversely, in vitro antisense oligonucleotide inhibition of the lncRNA reciprocally regulated cell growth and migration, and gene expression. Notably, GHSROS modulates the expression of PPP2R2C, the loss of which may drive androgen receptor pathway-independent prostate tumor progression in a subset of prostate cancers.

Accurate, reliable and detailed incidence data are needed to respond effectively to the growing human costs of cancer in an aging population. The purpose of this study was to examine the characteristics of incident cases and evaluate the impact of death-certificate-only (DCO) cases on cancer incidence rates in older adults.  Methods:   Using data from 47 cancer registries and detailed population estimates from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program, we examined reporting sources, methods of diagnosis, tumor characteristics, and calculated age-specific incidence rates with and without DCO cases in adults aged 65 through ≥95 years, diagnosed 2011 through 2015, by sex and race/ethnicity.  Results:   The percentage of cases (all cancers combined) reported from a hospital decreased from 90.6% (ages 65-69 years) to 69.1% (ages ≥95 years) while the percentage of DCO cases increased from 1.1% to 19.6%. Excluding DCO cases, positive diagnostic confirmation decreased as age increased from 96.8% (ages 65-69 years) to 69.2% (ages ≥95 years). Compared to incidence rates that included DCO cases, rates in adults aged ≥95 years that excluded DCO cases were 41.5% lower in Black men with prostate cancer and 29.2% lower in Hispanic women with lung cancer.  Discussion:   Loss of reported tumor specificity with age is consistent with fewer hospital reports. However, the majority of cancers diagnosed in older patients, including those aged ≥95 years, were positively confirmed and were reported with known site, histology, and stage information. The high percentage of DCO cases among patients aged ≥85 years suggests the need to explore additional sources of follow-back to help possibly identify an earlier incidence report. Interstate data exchange following National Death Index linkages may help registries identify and remove erroneous DCO cases from their databases.""","""['Hannah K Weir', 'Recinda Sherman', 'Mandi Yu', 'Susan Gershman', 'Brenda M Hofer', 'Manxia Wu', 'Don Green']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Registry Manag""","""['Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer, part I: National cancer statistics.', 'Determinants and interpretation of death certificate only proportions in the initial years of newly established cancer registries.', 'Why did treatment rates for colorectal cancer in south east England fall between 1982 and 1988?

Objective:   To investigate the tolerability, safety, and antitumor effects of the intraprostatic NanoZolid depot formulation Liproca Depot (LIDDS AB, Uppsala, Sweden) with antiandrogen 2-hydroxyflutamide (2-HOF) in men with low- or intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer managed with active surveillance.  Design, setting, and participants:   This clinical phase 2b trial, LPC-004, involved 61 patients. The 2-HOF-containing formulation Liproca Depot was injected transrectally into the prostate under ultrasound guidance. A single dose of 35% or 45% of the prostate volume (study part 1) and a fixed dose of 16 or 20 ml (study part 2) of the formulation were evaluated.  Outcome measurements and statistical analyses:   The primary endpoints were tolerability and the reduction in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 5 mo after injection. Antitumor effects were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and prostate biopsies. Quality of life was assessed using a validated questionnaire (International Prostate Symptom Score).  Results and limitations:   All doses were safe and well tolerated, without hormonal side effects. In part 2 of the study, the PSA reduction was greatest for the group receiving 16 ml, with an average decrease of 14%, and 95% of patients had a PSA reduction. Some 78% of patients showed a prostate volume decrease compared to baseline. Prostate MRI and biopsies confirmed stable or reduced lesion size. However, post treatment biopsies were performed at the discretion of the investigator, and not routinely. Most patients were amenable to a second injection.  Conclusions:   PSA and prostate volume decreased in most patients. Indications of efficacy were shown by post-treatment MRI and biopsies demonstrating stabilization or regression in the majority of cases.

Initial clinical trials have shown a positive response to targeted treatment in some cases of NRG1 rearranged lung adenocarcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and pancreatic carcinoma. The cost-effective large scale identification of NRG1 rearranged tumors is an open question. We have tested a data-drilling approach by performing a retrospective assessment of a de-identified molecular profiling database of 3263 tumors submitted for fusion testing. Gene fusion detection was performed by RNA-based targeted next-generation sequencing using the Archer Fusion Plex kits for Illumina (ArcherDX Inc., Boulder, CO). Novel fusion transcripts were confirmed by a custom-designed RT-PCR. Also, the aberrant expression of CK20 was studied immunohistochemically. The frequency of NRG1 rearranged tumors was 0.2% (7/3263). The most common histologic type was lung adenocarcinoma (n = 5). Also, renal carcinoma (n = 1) and prostatic adenocarcinoma (n = 1) were found. Identified fusion partners were of a wide range (CD74, SDC4, TNC, VAMP2, UNC5D), with CD74, SDC4 being found twice. The UNC5D is a novel fusion partner identified in prostate adenocarcinoma. There was no co-occurrence with the other tested fusions nor KRAS, BRAF, and the other gene mutations specified in the applied gene panels. Immunohistochemically, the focal expression of CK20 was present in 2 lung adenocarcinomas. We believe it should be considered as an incidental finding. In conclusion, the overall frequency of tumors with NRG1 fusion was 0.2%. All tumors were carcinomas. We confirm (invasive mucinous) lung adenocarcinoma as being the most frequent tumor presenting NRG1 fusion. Herein novel putative pathogenic gene fusion UNC5D-NRG1 is described.

Their cellular effects could be similar or opposite depending on the genetic target, cell type and context. Despite the reported association of calcitriol deficiency and disruption of the TGF-β pathway in prostate cancer and the well-known independent effects of calcitriol and TGF-βs on cancer cells, there is limited information regarding the cellular effects of calcitriol and TGF-β in combination. In this study, we in vitro analyze the combinatory effects of calcitriol and TGF-β on cell growth and apoptosis using PC-3 and DU145 human prostate cancer cell lines. Using high-throughput microarray profiling of PC-3 cells upon independent and combinatory treatments, we identified distinct transcriptional landscapes of each intervention, with a higher effect established by the combinatorial treatment, following by TGF-β1 and later by calcitriol. A set of genes and enriched pathways converge among the treatments, mainly between the combinatory scheme and TGF-β1, but the majority were treatment-specific. Of note, CYP24A1, IGFBP3, CDKN1A, NOX4 and UBE2D3 were significantly up-regulated upon the combinatorial treatment whereas CCNA1, members of the CT45A and APOBEC3 family were down-regulated. By public RNA signatures, we were able to confirm the regulation by the co-treatment over cell proliferation and cell cycle. We finally investigated the possible clinical impact of genes modulated by the combinatorial treatment using benchmark prostate cancer data. This comprehensive analysis reveals that the combinatory treatment impairs cell growth without affecting apoptosis and their combinatory actions might synergize and improved their individual effects to reprogram prostate cancer signaling.""","""['Mitzi García-Olivares', 'Sandra Romero-Córdoba', 'Elizabeth Ortiz-Sánchez', 'Rocío García-Becerra', 'Mariana Segovia-Mendoza', 'Claudia Rangel-Escareño', 'Ali Halhali', 'Fernando Larrea', 'David Barrera']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol""","""['TGF-β Effects on Prostate Cancer Cell Migration and Invasion Require FosB.', 'Calcitriol-induced prostate-derived factor: autocrine control of prostate cancer cell growth.', 'Vitamin D regulating TGF-β induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'Molecular pathways mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of calcitriol: implications for prostate cancer chemoprevention and treatment.', 'Comparative regulation of gene expression by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in cells derived from normal mammary tissue and breast cancer.', 'Lncap-AI prostate cancer cell line establishment by Flutamide and androgen-free environment to promote cell adherent.', 'LINC02257, an Enhancer RNA of Prognostic Value in Colon Adenocarcinoma, Correlates With Multi-Omics Immunotherapy-Related Analysis in 33 Cancers.']"""

Materials and methods:   The framework was active during the delivery of 1207 online adapted plans corresponding to 127 clinical IMRT treatments (74 prostate, 19 rectum, 19 liver and 15 lymph node oligometastases). EPID reconstructed dose distributions in the patient geometry were calculated automatically and then compared to the dose distributions calculated online by the treatment planning system (TPS). The comparison was performed by γ-analysis (3% global/2mm/10% threshold) and by the difference in median dose to the high-dose volume (ΔHDVD50). 85% for γ-pass rate and 5% for ΔHDVD50 were used as tolerance limit values.  Results:   93% of the online plans were verified automatically by the framework. Missing EPID data was the reason for automation failure. 91% of the verified plans were within tolerance.  Conclusion:   Automatic dosimetric verification of online adapted plans on the Unity MR-Linac is feasible using in vivo 3D EPID dosimetry.

Objective:   To determine this, we undertook a cross-sectional survey covering 10% of the English population.  Design, setting, and participants:   Participants 1-10 yr from diagnosis were identified through national cancer registration data.  Intervention:   A postal survey was administered containing generic HRQOL and BC-specific outcome measures. Findings were compared with those of the general population and other pelvic cancer patients.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Generic HRQOL was measured using five-level EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L) and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ)-C30. BC-specific outcomes were derived from EORTC QLQ-BLM30 and EORTC QLQ-NMIBC24.  Results and limitations:   A total of 1796 surveys were completed (response rate 55%), including 868 (48%) patients with non-muscle-invasive BC, 893 (50%) patients who received radiotherapy or radical cystectomy, and 35 (1.9%) patients for whom treatment was unknown. Most (69%) of the participants reported at least one problem in any EQ-5D dimension. Age/sex-adjusted generic HRQOL outcomes were similar across all stages and treatment groups, whilst problems increased with age (problems in one or more EQ-5D dimensions: <65 yr [67% {95% confidence interval or CI: 61-74}] vs 85+ yr [84% {95% CI: 81-89}], p = 0.016) and long-term conditions (no conditions [53% {95% CI: 48-58}] vs more than four conditions [94% {95% CI: 90-97}], p < 0.001). Sexual problems were reported commonly in men, increasing with younger age and radical treatment. Younger participants (under 65 yr) reported more financial difficulties (mean score 20 [95% CI: 16-25]) than those aged 85+ yr (6.8 [4.5-9.2], p < 0.001). HRQOL for BC patients (for comparison, males with problems in one or more EQ-5D dimensions 69% [95% CI: 66-72]) was significantly worse than what has been found after colorectal and prostate cancers and in the general population (51% [95% CI: 48-53], all p < 0.05).  Conclusions:   HRQOL following BC appears to be relatively independent of disease stage, treatment, and multimodal care. Issues are reported with sexual function and financial toxicity. HRQOL after BC is worse than that after other pelvic cancers.  Patient summary:   Patients living with bladder cancer often have reduced quality of life, which may be worse than that for other common pelvic cancer patients. Age and other illnesses appear to be more important in determining this quality of life than the treatments received. Many men complain of sexual problems. Younger patients have financial worries.""","""['James W F Catto', 'Amy Downing', 'Samantha Mason', 'Penny Wright', 'Kate Absolom', 'Sarah Bottomley', 'Luke Hounsome', 'Syed Hussain', 'Mohini Varughese', 'Caroline Raw', 'Phil Kelly', 'Adam W Glaser']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Seeing the Unseen: Uncovering Patient-reported Outcomes in Bladder Cancer.', 'Sexual Activity, Function and Dysfunction After a Diagnosis of Bladder Cancer.', 'Europa Uomo Patient Reported Outcome Study (EUPROMS): Descriptive Statistics of a Prostate Cancer Survey from Patients for Patients.', 'Assessing the validity of EQ-5D-5L in people with head & neck cancer: Does a generic quality of life measure perform as well as a disease-specific measure in a patient population?', 'Use of generic and condition-specific measures of health-related quality of life in NICE decision-making: a systematic review, statistical modelling and survey.', 'Health-related quality of life in bladder cancer patients: bladder cancer-specific instruments and domains.

Transdermal administration of oestradiol (tE2) circumvents first-pass hepatic metabolism and, therefore, should avoid the cardiovascular toxicity seen with oral oestrogen and the oestrogen-depletion effects seen with luteinising hormone releasing hormone agonists (LHRHa). We present long-term cardiovascular follow-up data from the Prostate Adenocarcinoma Transcutaneous Hormone (PATCH) trial programme.  Methods:   PATCH is a seamless phase 2/3, randomised, multicentre trial programme at 52 study sites in the UK. Men with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer were randomly allocated (1:2 from August, 2007 then 1:1 from February, 2011) to either LHRHa according to local practice or tE2 patches (four 100 μg patches per 24 h, changed twice weekly, reducing to three patches twice weekly if castrate at 4 weeks [defined as testosterone ≤1·7 nmol/L]). Randomisation was done using a computer-based minimisation algorithm and was stratified by several factors, including disease stage, age, smoking status, and family history of cardiac disease. The primary outcome of this analysis was cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Cardiovascular events, including heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, thromboembolic stroke, and other thromboembolic events, were confirmed using predefined criteria and source data. Sudden or unexpected deaths were attributed to a cardiovascular category if a confirmatory post-mortem report was available and as other relevant events if no post-mortem report was available. PATCH is registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN70406718; the study is ongoing and adaptive.  Findings:   Between Aug 14, 2007, and July 30, 2019, 1694 men were randomly allocated either LHRHa (n=790) or tE2 patches (n=904). Overall, median follow-up was 3·9 (IQR 2·4-7·0) years. Respective castration rates at 1 month and 3 months were 65% and 93% among patients assigned LHRHa and 83% and 93% among those allocated tE2. 157 events from 145 men met predefined cardiovascular criteria, with a further ten sudden deaths with no post-mortem report (total 167 events in 153 men). 26 (2%) of 1694 patients had fatal cardiovascular events, 15 (2%) of 790 assigned LHRHa and 11 (1%) of 904 allocated tE2. The time to first cardiovascular event did not differ between treatments (hazard ratio 1·11, 95% CI 0·80-1·53; p=0·54 [including sudden deaths without post-mortem report]; 1·20, 0·86-1·68; p=0·29 [confirmed group only]). 30 (34%) of 89 cardiovascular events in patients assigned tE2 occurred more than 3 months after tE2 was stopped or changed to LHRHa. The most frequent adverse events were gynaecomastia (all grades), with 279 (38%) events in 730 patients who received LHRHa versus 690 (86%) in 807 patients who received tE2 (p<0·0001) and hot flushes (all grades) in 628 (86%) of those who received LHRHa versus 280 (35%) who received tE2 (p<0·0001).

We aimed to compare [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 with cabazitaxel in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.  Methods:   We did this multicentre, unblinded, randomised phase 2 trial at 11 centres in Australia. We recruited men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer for whom cabazitaxel was considered the next appropriate standard treatment. Participants were required to have adequate renal, haematological, and liver function, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2. Previous treatment with androgen receptor-directed therapy was allowed. Men underwent gallium-68 [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 and 2-flourine-18[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET-CT scans. PET eligibility criteria for the trial were PSMA-positive disease, and no sites of metastatic disease with discordant FDG-positive and PSMA-negative findings. Men were randomly assigned (1:1) to [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 (6·0-8·5 GBq intravenously every 6 weeks for up to six cycles) or cabazitaxel (20 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks for up to ten cycles). The primary endpoint was prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response defined by a reduction of at least 50% from baseline. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03392428.  Findings:   Between Feb 6, 2018, and Sept 3, 2019, we screened 291 men, of whom 200 were eligible on PET imaging. Study treatment was received by 98 (99%) of 99 men randomly assigned to [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 versus 85 (84%) of 101 randomly assigned to cabazitaxel. PSA responses were more frequent among men in the [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 group than in the cabazitaxel group (65 vs 37 PSA responses; 66% vs 37% by intention to treat; difference 29% (95% CI 16-42; p<0·0001; and 66% vs 44% by treatment received; difference 23% [9-37]; p=0·0016). Grade 3-4 adverse events occurred in 32 (33%) of 98 men in the [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 group versus 45 (53%) of 85 men in the cabazitaxel group. No deaths were attributed to [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617.  Interpretation:   [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 compared with cabazitaxel in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer led to a higher PSA response and fewer grade 3 or 4 adverse events. [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 is a new effective class of therapy and a potential alternative to cabazitaxel.

Multi-leaf collimator (MLC) tracking has been clinically implemented to adapt dose delivery to account for intrafraction motion. Current methods shift the planned MLC aperture in the direction of motion, then optimise the new aperture based on the difference in fluence. The drawback of these methods is that 3D dose, a function of patient anatomy and MLC aperture sequence, is not properly accounted for. To overcome the drawback of current fluence-based methods, we have developed and investigated real-time adaptive MLC tracking based on dose optimisation. A novel MLC tracking algorithm, dose optimisation, has been developed which accounts for the moving patient anatomy by optimising the MLC based on the dose delivered during treatment, simulated using a simplified dose calculation algorithm. The MLC tracking with dose optimisation method was applied in silico to a prostate cancer VMAT treatment dataset with observed intrafraction motion. Its performance was compared to MLC tracking with fluence optimisation and, as a baseline, without MLC tracking. To quantitatively assess performance, we computed the dose error and 3D γ failure rate (2 mm/2%) for each fraction and method. Dose optimisation achieved a γ failure rate of (4.7 ± 1.2)% (mean and standard deviation) over all fractions, which was significantly lower than fluence optimisation (7.5 ± 2.9)% (Wilcoxon sign-rank test p < 0.01). Without MLC tracking, a γ failure rate of (15.3 ± 12.9)% was achieved. By considering the accumulation of dose in the moving anatomy during treatment, dose optimisation is able to optimise the aperture to actively target regions of underdose while avoiding overdose.""","""['Lars Mejnertsen', 'Emily Hewson', 'Doan Trang Nguyen', 'Jeremy Booth', 'Paul Keall']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Optimising multi-target multileaf collimator tracking using real-time dose for locally advanced prostate cancer patients.', 'Electromagnetic guided couch and multileaf collimator tracking on a TrueBeam accelerator.', 'Adapting to the motion of multiple independent targets using multileaf collimator tracking for locally advanced prostate cancer: Proof of principle simulation study.', 'Potential improvements of lung and prostate MLC tracking investigated by treatment simulations.', 'A review of artificial intelligence applications for motion tracking in radiotherapy.', 'The dosimetric error due to uncorrected tumor rotation during real-time adaptive prostate stereotactic body radiation therapy.']"""

The main tumor marker used in this disease, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), does not provide information related to this tumor microenvironment. Cancer cells secrete exosomes carrying bioactive molecules contributing to MDSCs recruitment and induction. The aim of this study was to characterize the perioperative changes of exosomal cytokines relevant in MDSCs recruitment induced by prostatectomy in prostate cancer patients.  Methods:   Blood was drawn from 26 early-stage prostate cancer patients before and after radical prostatectomy and from 16 healthy volunteers. Serum exosomes were separated by precipitation. Cytokines related with MDSC cell recruitment and activation CCL2, CXCL2, CXCL5, CXCL8, CXCL12, MIF, S100A9 and TGF-ß were measured in serum and serum-derived exosomes using immunometric assays.  Results:   All cytokines were detected both in serum and exosomes, except for CXCL12, which was detected only in serum. Exosomes were enriched specially in MIF, TGF-ß and CXCL2. Presurgical MIF levels in exosomes correlated negatively with serum PSA. Also, presurgical TGF-ß decreased both in serum and exosomes as Gleason score rises. Patientś presurgical exosomes had increased CCL2, CXCL5 and TGF-ß levels than exosomes from healthy controls. These differences were not observed when cytokines were analyzed in serum, except for TGF-ß. Cytokine levels of CCL2, CXCL5 decreased in patients' postsurgical exosomes, while TGF-ß further increased. On the contrary, S100A9 levels were lower in patientś presurgical exosomes but increased after radical prostatectomy.

Posterior rhabdosphincter reconstruction was designed to improve urinary continence after radical prostatectomy. The aim of this study was to determine magnetic resonance anatomic predictors of urinary recovery after radical prostatectomy, and to assess their relation to the type of reconstruction.  Material and methods:   Forty patients were randomly selected from a trial (NCT03302169). Two independent radiologists determined the situation of the anastomosis in the pelvis according to MRI performed a month after the radical prostatectomy: vertical situation assessed as the distance to the line coccyx-inferior pubic margin (ACPv) and anteroposterior situation as the distance from the pubis (Distance A), and from the coccyx (Distance B).  Results:   The Pearson correlation of ACPv, Distance A, and B between readers were 0.975, 0.940, and 0.711, p < 0.001. Patients with the reconstruction presented more cephalic situation of the anastomosis (higher ACPv) than patients with standard reconstruction technique. A multivariate analysis was performed including age, BMI, prostate volume, PRRS, and the MRI parameters. ACPv and Distance B were the only two independent predictors of no need for any urinary protection at 6 months after the surgery.  Conclusions:   This is the first study that suggests positional differences according to the type of reconstruction after radical prostatectomy related to early urinary recovery. Magnetic resonance measurements to determine anastomosis positioning are reliable and have a strong correlation between readers.

Population based reference ranges, known as 'static' or 'normal' reference ranges, are often used as a tool to classify a biomarker value for an individual as typical or atypical. However, these ranges may not be informative to a particular individual when considering changes in a biomarker over time since each observation is assessed in isolation and against the same reference limits. To allow early detection of unusual physiological changes, adaptation of static reference ranges is required that incorporates within-individual variability of biomarkers arising from longitudinal monitoring in addition to between-individual variability. To overcome this issue, methods for generating individualised reference ranges are proposed within a Bayesian framework which adapts successively whenever a new measurement is recorded for the individual. This new Bayesian approach also allows the within-individual variability to differ for each individual, compared to other less flexible approaches. However, the Bayesian approach usually comes with a high computational cost, especially for individuals with a large number of observations, that diminishes its applicability. This difficulty suggests that a computational approximation may be required. Thus, methods for generating individualised adaptive ranges by the use of a time-efficient approximate Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm will be presented which relies only on a few sufficient statistics at the individual level.""","""['Davood Roshan', 'John Ferguson', 'Charles R Pedlar', 'Andrew Simpkin', 'William Wyns', 'Frank Sullivan', 'John Newell']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['On adaptation cost and tractability in robust adaptive radiation therapy optimization.', 'A New Method to Individualize Monitoring of Muscle Recovery in Athletes.', 'A parametric empirical Bayes method for cancer screening using longitudinal observations of a biomarker.', 'Population kinetics and conditional assessment of the optimal dosage regimen using the P-PHARM software package.', 'The Bayesian adaptive lasso regression.', 'Determining reference ranges and sample sizes in parallel-group studies.', 'Stress Monitoring Using Wearable Sensors: A Pilot Study and Stress-Predict Dataset.']"""

Patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer selected for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy were included between January 2017 and April 2020 from a high volume prostate cancer center. Eight different treatment regimens were compared, ie a combination of general anesthesia and a transversus abdominis plane block with either an additional dose of clonidine or an additional dose of ketamine, or perivesical infiltrations (with 20 ml ropivacaine), or periurethral infiltrations (with ropivacaine); or a dorsal penile nerve block (with 20 ml ropivacaine). Multiple logistic regression and linear mixed models were used to analyze differences in catheter-related bladder discomfort and pain (0-10) at the postoperative recovery unit between the treatment protocols.  Results:   Of the 391 patients included, those with a combination transversus abdominis plane block, perivesical and periurethral block with ropivacaine had the lowest incidence of catheter-related bladder discomfort, clinically relevant and statistically significantly lower compared to our baseline protocol (transversus abdominis plane block only), ie 36% vs 70%, p=0.001. Overall, patients who were treated with periurethral and/or perivesical infiltrations reported a statistically significantly lower incidence of catheter-related bladder discomfort compared to patients who did not receive this local infiltration (46.5% vs 60.7%, p=0.001).  Conclusions:   Perivesical and periurethral injections with ropivacaine have the potential to reduce the incidence of early postoperative catheter-related bladder discomfort by up to 49%. Further randomized studies are necessary to determine the optimal treatment regime to prevent early postoperative catheter-related bladder discomfort.""","""['Hans Veerman', 'Aletta P I Houwink', 'Peter F E Schutte', 'Jakko A Nieuwenhuijzen', 'Ton A Roeleveld', 'Esther Wit', 'Jan Willem Mazel', 'Tim M van der Sluis', 'André N Vis', 'Pim J van Leeuwen', 'Henk G van der Poel']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['INTRAOPERATIVE STRATEGIES TO REDUCE CATHETER-RELATED BLADDER DISCOMFORT IN THE EARLY POSTOPERATIVE PERIOD AFTER ROBOT-ASSISTED RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY: ERRATUM.', 'Editorial Comment.', 'Impact of Combination of Local Anesthetic Wounds Infiltration and Ultrasound Transversus Abdominal Plane Block in Patients Undergoing Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Perioperative Results of a Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial.', 'Early Catheter Removal after Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Surgical Technique and Outcomes for the Aalst Technique (ECaRemA Study).', ""Ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane block (US-TAPb) for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a novel '4-point' technique-results of a prospective, randomized study."", 'Suprapubic Versus Urethral Catheter for Urinary Drainage After Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Suprapubic tube versus urethral catheter drainage after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

We assessed whether treating lower urinary tract symptoms with dutasteride altered either nocturia or sleep quality using data from REDUCE.  Materials and methods:   REDUCE was a 4-year randomized, multicenter trial comparing dutasteride 0.5 mg/day vs placebo for prostate cancer chemoprevention. Study participants were men considered at increased risk for prostate cancer. Eligibility included age 50-75 years, prostate specific antigen 2.5-10 ng/ml, and 1 negative prostate biopsy. At baseline, 2 years and 4 years, men completed the International Prostate Symptom Score and Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale, a 6-item scale assessing sleep. To test differences in nocturia and Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale over time, we used linear mixed models adjusted for baseline confounders. Subanalyses were conducted in men symptomatic from lower urinary tract symptoms, nocturia, poor sleep, or combinations thereof.  Results:   Of 6,914 men with complete baseline data, 80% and 59% were assessed at 2 and 4-year followup, respectively. Baseline characteristics were balanced between treatment arms. Dutasteride improved nocturia at 2 (-0.15, 95% CI -0.21, -0.09) and 4 years (-0.24, 95% CI -0.31, -0.18) but did not improve sleep. When limited to men symptomatic from lower urinary tract symptoms, nocturia, poor sleep or combinations thereof, results mirrored findings from the full cohort.  Conclusions:   In men with poor sleep who complain of nocturia, treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms with dutasteride modestly improves nocturia but has no effect on sleep. These results suggest men with poor sleep who complain of nocturia may not benefit from oral benign prostatic hyperplasia treatment.""","""['Paige K Kuhlmann', 'Sean C Fischer', 'Lauren E Howard', 'Daniel M Moreira', 'Gerald L Andriole', 'Martin L Hopp', 'Claus G Roehrborn', 'Donald L Bliwise', 'Stephen J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Impact of dutasteride on nocturia in men with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS/BPH): a pooled analysis of three phase III studies.', 'Nocturia improvement in the combination of Avodart(®) and tamsulosin (CombAT) study.', 'Early effect of dutasteride added to alpha-1 blocker therapy for patients with lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Medical Treatment of Nocturia in Men with Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms: Systematic Review by the European Association of Urology Guidelines Panel for Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms.', 'Current Pharmacological Treatment for Male LUTS due to BPH: Dutasteride or Finasteride?']"""

The objective of this study was to assess the individual protein expression and co-expression of Twist, Slug (Snai2), Snail (Snai1), and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (Hif-1α) in prostate cancer in relation to EMT, angiogenesis, hypoxia, tumour features, disease recurrence, and patient survival. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on tissue microarray sections from 338 radical prostatectomies with long follow-up. In addition, 41 cases of prostatic hyperplasia, 33 non-skeletal metastases, 13 skeletal metastases, and 33 castration-resistant prostate carcinomas were included. Our findings were validated in external gene expression data sets. Twist was overexpressed in primary prostate cancer and markedly reduced in distant metastases (p < 0.0005). Strong expression of Twist and Slug was associated with Hif-1α in localised prostate cancer (p ≤ 0.001), and strong Twist was associated with Hif-1α in castration-resistant carcinomas (p = 0.044). Twist, Slug, and increased Snail at the tumour stromal border were associated with vascular factors (p ≤ 0.045). Each of the three EMT-regulating transcription factors were associated with aggressive tumour features and shorter time to recurrence and cancer-specific death. Notably, the co-expression of factors demonstrated an enhanced influence on outcome. In the subgroup of E-cadherinlow carcinomas, strong Slug was associated with shorter time to all end points and was an independent predictor of time to multiple end points, including cancer-specific death (hazard ratio 3.0, p = 0.041). To conclude, we demonstrate an important relation between EMT, hypoxia, and angiogenesis and a strong link between the investigated EMT regulators and aggressive tumour features and poor patient outcome in prostate cancer. Despite the retrospective nature of this long-term study, our findings could have a significant impact on the future treatment of prostate cancer, where tailored therapies might be directed simultaneously against epithelial-mesenchymal phenotypes, angiogenesis, and tumour hypoxia.""","""['Astrid Børretzen', 'Karsten Gravdal', 'Svein A Haukaas', 'Monica Mannelqvist', 'Christian Beisland', 'Lars A Akslen', 'Ole J Halvorsen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Pathol Clin Res""","""['Prognostic value of Twist, Snail and E-cadherin expression in pathological N0 non-small-cell lung cancer: a retrospective cohort study.', 'FOXC2 expression and epithelial-mesenchymal phenotypes are associated with castration resistance, metastasis and survival in prostate cancer.', 'Tumor budding at the invasive front of colorectal cancer may not be associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'Prognostic significance of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha, TWIST1 and Snail expression in resectable non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Signaling and Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: Emerging Biomarkers and Opportunities for Precision Therapeutics.', 'Upregulation of SLUG expression in canine mammary gland tumors and its prognostic significance.', 'LINC01117 inhibits invasion and migration of lung adenocarcinoma through influencing EMT process.', 'Ginsenosides from Panax ginseng as Key Modulators of NF-κB Signaling Are Powerful Anti-Inflammatory and Anticancer Agents.', 'Adipose Tissue-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Contribute to Phenotypic Plasticity of Prostate Cancer Cells.', '3-Bromopyruvate Suppresses the Malignant Phenotype of Vemurafenib-Resistant Melanoma Cells.']"""

Here, we confirmed that SeNPs could inhibit the CaP cell migrations and invasions. Combined with our previous findings, we identified a series of microRNAs that could be upregulated significantly under SeNP treatment, among which miR-155-5p acts as a key component in mediating the SeNP-inhibited migration and invasion of CaP cells, through directly targeting IκB kinase ɛ and Sma- and Mad-related protein 2.

The HACE1 (HECT domain and ankyrin repeat-containing E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase) gene is a tumor suppressor that inhibits the growth, invasive capacity, and metastasis of cancer cells. However, the direct regulatory pathways whereby HACE1 confers this tumor-suppressive effect remain to be fully elucidated. In this report, we establish a link between HACE1 and the major stress factor, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1α). We find that HACE1 blocks the accumulation of HIF1α during cellular hypoxia through decreased protein stability. This property is dependent on HACE1 E3 ligase activity and loss of Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (RAC1), an established target of HACE1 mediated ubiquitinylation and degradation. In vivo, genetic deletion of Rac1 reversed the increased HIF1α expression observed in Hace1-/- mice in murine KRasG12D-driven lung tumors. An inverse relationship was observed between HACE1 and HIF1α levels in tumors compared to patient-matched normal kidney tissues, highlighting the potential pathophysiological significance of our findings.

Using data from two prospective trials (NCT03368547 and NCT04050215), we explored predictors of overall upstaging (nodal and metastatic) by PSMA PET/CT among patients with cN0M0 National Comprehensive Cancer Network high-risk PCa on conventional imaging (n = 213). Overall, 21.1%, 8.9%, and 23.9% of patients experienced nodal, metastatic, and overall upstaging, respectively, without histologic confirmation. On multivariable analysis, Gleason grade group (GG) and percent positive core (PPC) on systematic biopsy significantly predict overall upstaging (odds ratio [OR] 2.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.33-3.45; p = 0.002; and OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.04; p < 0.001). Overall upstaging was significantly more frequent among men with GG 5 disease (33.0% vs. 17.6%; p = 0.0097) and PPC ≥50% (33.0% vs 15.0%; p = 0.0020). We constructed a nomogram that predicts overall upstaging using initial prostate-specific antigen, PPC, GG, and cT stage, with coefficients estimated from a standard logistic regression model (using maximum likelihood estimation). It is internally validated with a tenfold cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve estimated at 0.74 (95% CI 0.67-0.82). In our cohort, 90% of patients who had a nomogram-estimated risk below the cutoff of 22% for overall upstaging could have been spared PSMA PET/CT as our model correctly predicted no upstaging. In other words, the predictive model only missed 10% of patients who would otherwise have benefitted from PSMA PET/CT. PATIENT SUMMARY: We analyzed predictors of overall upstaging (lymph node or/and metastasis) by prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) from conventional imaging in men with high-risk prostate cancer undergoing initial staging deemed free of disease in the lymph nodes and distant metastasis by conventional imaging techniques.

Objective:   Herein, we report our initial experience of patients treated by VTP. We compared short-term functional and oncological outcomes with those of a consecutive cohort of patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) for unilateral low-risk PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   Patients with unilateral low-risk PCa undergoing VTP (n = 41) and RP (n = 49) were evaluated in a real-world setting.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Oncological outcome after VTP was measured by magnetic resonance imaging-based rebiopsy at 12 and 24 mo. Functional outcome after 1 yr was investigated by International Index of Erectile Function 5 and International Prostate Symptom Score questionnaires. Continence was evaluated by pad use.  Results and limitations:   In 12- and 24-mo control biopsy (n = 22) after VTP, 45% of VTP patients showed no evidence of PCa. Both low- and intermediate-risk PCa were detected in 27% of patients. None of the RP patients had a PCa recurrence. Of VTP and RP patients, 71% and 30%, respectively, preserved erectile function. Of VTP patients, 88% had no bladder outlet obstruction. Of RP patients, 96% and 4% used zero to one and two or more pads per day, respectively. Data acquisition was performed outside of a clinical trial. The short-term follow-up and the small number of rebiopsied patients have to be considered.  Conclusions:   VTP is a promising treatment option in unilateral low-risk PCa presenting a lower complication profile than RP in a real-world setting. However, recurrence and progression after VTP are common in this low-risk PCa cohort, and have to be discussed critically with patients who wish VTP instead of active surveillance. Therefore, a rigorous surveillance strategy with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and control biopsy is required.  Patient summary:   Vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy (VTP) is a promising therapy option in patients with unilateral low-risk prostate cancer. However, tumour recurrence has to be taken into account. Noninferiority of VTP to standard curative treatment options still has to be confirmed.""","""['Luka Flegar', 'Björn Buerk', 'Rick Proschmann', 'Stefan Propping', 'Christer Groeben', 'Martin Baunacke', 'Roman Herout', 'Johannes Huber', 'Christian Thomas', 'Angelika Borkowetz']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['TOOKAD(®) Soluble vascular-targeted photodynamic (VTP) therapy: determination of optimal treatment conditions and assessment of effects in patients with localised prostate cancer.', 'Medium-term Follow-up of Vascular-targeted Photodynamic Therapy of Localized Prostate Cancer Using TOOKAD Soluble WST-11 (Phase II Trials).', 'Feasibility, safety, and efficacy of salvage radical prostatectomy after Tookad® Soluble focal treatment for localized prostate cancer.', 'A Systematic Review of Focal Ablative Therapy for Clinically Localised Prostate Cancer in Comparison with Standard Management Options: Limitations of the Available Evidence and Recommendations for Clinical Practice and Further Research.', 'Vascular targeted photodynamic therapy in low-risk prostate cancer.

Materials and methods:   We included 126,682 prostate cancer (CaP) cM0 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy with lymph node dissection between 2010 and 2015, within the National Cancer Database. Patients who received androgen deprivation therapy were included. Patients were divided into four sub-cohorts based on LVI and lymph node invasion (LNI) status: pL0N0, pL1N0, pL0N1, and pL1N1. Kaplan-Meier curves estimated OS and Cox-regression analysis tested the relationship between LVI and OS.  Results:   Median (IQR) age and PSA at diagnosis were 62 (57-66) years and 5.7 (4.5-8.9) ng/ml, respectively. Most patients had pT2 stage (68.5%), and pathological Gleason 3+4 (46.7%). 10.0% and 4.0% patients had LVI and LNI, respectively. Median follow-up was 42 months (27-58). At 5-years, OS was 96.5% in pL0N0 patients vs 93.1% pL1N0 patients vs 93.3% in pL0N1 patients vs 86.6% pL1N1 patients. LVI was an independent predictor of OS (hazard ratio [HR]:1.28). LVI showed interaction with LNI, as LVI was associated with a higher overall-mortality in patients with LNI (HR:1.66), than in patients without LNI (HR:1.22). (all P<0.0001) CONCLUSIONS: Our report highlights the detrimental impact of LVI on OS. Patients with LVI alone fared similarly to patients with LNI alone. Patients with both LVI and LNI had worse OS than those with only LVI or LNI, implying a synergetic detrimental interaction.

Multivariable analysis adjusted for patient and hospital level characteristics to ascertain the effect of depression on post-operative outcomes and 30-day readmission rates. Non-routine discharge encompasses discharge to skilled nursing, inpatient rehabilitation, and intermediate care facilities, as well as discharge home with home health services.  Results:   Among 851,606 surgically treated cancer patients, 8.1% had a comorbid diagnosis of depression at index admission (n = 69,174). Prevalence of depression was highest among patients with cancer of the brain (10.9%), female genital organs (10.9%), and lung (10.5%), and lowest among those with prostate cancer (4.9%). Depression prevalence among women (10.9%) was almost twice that of men (5.7%).

In the current study, we describe the synthesis of a series of 211At-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) inhibitors and their preliminary evaluation as potential agents for metastatic prostate cancer treatment.  Methods:   Four novel Glu-urea based PSMA ligands containing a trialkyl stannyl group were synthesized and labeled with 211At, and for comparative purposes, 131I, via halodestannylation reactions with N-chlorosuccinimide as the oxidant. A PSMA inhibitory assay was performed to evaluate PSMA binding of the unlabeled, iodinated compounds. A series of paired-label biodistribution experiments were performed to compare each 211At-labeled PSMA ligand to its 131I-labeled counterpart in mice bearing subcutaneous PC3 PSMA+ PIP xenografts.  Results:   Radiochemical yields ranged from 32% to 65% for the 211At-labeled PSMA inhibitors and were consistently lower than those obtained with the corresponding 131I-labeled analogue. Good localization in PC3 PSMA+ PIP but not control xenografts was observed for all labeled molecules studied, which exhibited a variable degree of in vivo dehalogenation as reflected by thyroid and stomach activity levels. Normal tissue uptake and in vivo stability for several of the compounds was markedly improved compared with the previously evaluated compounds, [211At]DCABzL and [*I]DCIBzL.  Conclusions and implications for patient care:   Compared with the first generation compound [211At]DCABzL, several of the novel 211At-labeled PSMA ligands exhibited markedly improved stability in vivo and higher tumor-to-normal tissue ratios.

Most previous work on whole slide image analysis has focused on classification or segmentation of small pre-selected regions-of-interest, which requires fine-grained annotation and is non-trivial to extend for large-scale whole slide analysis. In this paper, we proposed a multi-resolution multiple instance learning model that leverages saliency maps to detect suspicious regions for fine-grained grade prediction. Instead of relying on expensive region- or pixel-level annotations, our model can be trained end-to-end with only slide-level labels. The model is developed on a large-scale prostate biopsy dataset containing 20,229 slides from 830 patients. The model achieved 92.7% accuracy, 81.8% Cohen's Kappa for benign, low grade (i.e. Grade group 1) and high grade (i.e. Grade group ≥ 2) prediction, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 98.2% and an average precision (AP) of 97.4% for differentiating malignant and benign slides.

Since the survival of cancer patients is continuously improving, the late effects of treatments, including those related to radiation treatment, can affect the quality of life and health and of the patients themselves to a greater extent. Especially in the last 20 years, with the implementation of new techniques/forms of radiation therapy, the risk of developing radiation-induced tumors following radiation therapy has become a hotly debated topic. Malignant tumors induced by radiation therapy represent a particularly important problem for pediatric patients, who are intrinsically more sensitive to carcinogens than adults and have a longer life expectancy. To date, there is only one study in the literature, from 2019, which analyzes the risk of secondary tumors after carbon ion radiation compared to surgery or photon treatment and refers to patients treated for prostate cancer. Despite the high degree of uncertainty, the data acquired so far suggest that particle radiation therapy, especially with protons delivered with active scanning, carries a lower risk of radiation-induced tumors than conventional photon therapies. This is largely due to the lower doses to which healthy tissues are exposed and the low relative risk associated with exposure to neutrons throughout the body, especially when active scanning beams are used.""","""['Angelica Facoetti']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""G Ital Med Lav Ergon""","""['Risk of subsequent primary cancers after carbon ion radiotherapy, photon radiotherapy, or surgery for localised prostate cancer: a propensity score-weighted, retrospective, cohort study.', 'Risk assessment for cancer induction after low- and high-LET therapeutic irradiation.', 'Characterization of the secondary neutron field produced during treatment of an anthropomorphic phantom with x-rays, protons and carbon ions.', 'Hadrontherapy techniques for breast cancer.', 'Relative biological effectiveness of neutrons for cancer induction and other late effects: a review of radiobiological data.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Specific Cellular DNA Damage Response and Repair Induced by the Mixed Radiation Field During Boron Neutron Capture Therapy.']"""

One of the strongest prognostic indicators of outcome is grade groups based on the Gleason grading system. Gleason grade 4 prostate cancer with cribriform morphology is associated with adverse outcomes and can be utilized clinically to improve risk stratification. The underpinnings of disease aggressiveness associated with cribriform architecture are not fully understood. Most studies have focused on genetic and molecular alterations in cribriform tumor cells; however, less is known about the tumor microenvironment in cribriform prostate cancer. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a heterogeneous population of fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment that impact cancer aggressiveness. The overall goal of this study was to determine if cribriform prostate cancers are associated with a unique repertoire of CAFs. Radical prostatectomy whole-tissue sections were analyzed for the expression of fibroblast markers (ASPN in combination with FAP, THY1, ENG, NT5E, TNC, and PDGFRβ) in stroma adjacent to benign glands and in Gleason grade 3, Gleason grade 4 cribriform, and Gleason grade 4 noncribriform prostate cancer by RNAscope®. Halo® Software was used to quantify percent positive stromal cells and expression per positive cell. The fibroblast subtypes enriched in prostate cancer were highly heterogeneous. Both overlapping and distinct populations of low abundant fibroblast subtypes in benign prostate stroma were enriched in Gleason grade 4 prostate cancer with cribriform morphology compared to Gleason grade 4 prostate cancer with noncribriform morphology and Gleason grade 3 prostate cancer. In addition, gene expression was distinctly altered in CAF subtypes adjacent to cribriform prostate cancer. Overall, these studies suggest that cribriform prostate cancer has a unique tumor microenvironment that may distinguish it from other Gleason grade 4 morphologies and lower Gleason grades.""","""['Amanda B Hesterberg', 'Brenda L Rios', 'Elysa M Wolf', 'Colby Tubbs', 'Hong Yuen Wong', 'Kerry R Schaffer', 'Tamara L Lotan', 'Giovanna A Giannico', 'Jennifer B Gordetsky', 'Paula J Hurley']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Pathol Clin Res""","""['Alterations in the methylome of the stromal tumour microenvironment signal the presence and severity of prostate cancer.', 'PTEN loss and p27 loss differ among morphologic patterns of prostate cancer, including cribriform.', 'The Prostate Stromal Transcriptome in Aggressive and Lethal Prostate Cancer.', 'The 2019 Genitourinary Pathology Society (GUPS) White Paper on Contemporary Grading of Prostate Cancer.', 'The New Realization About Cribriform Prostate Cancer.', 'Single cell analysis of cribriform prostate cancer reveals cell intrinsic and tumor microenvironmental pathways of aggressive disease.', 'Pan-cancer analyses and molecular subtypes based on the cancer-associated fibroblast landscape and tumor microenvironment infiltration characterization reveal clinical outcome and immunotherapy response in epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'Cribriform Patterned Lesions in the Prostate Gland with Emphasis on Differential Diagnosis and Clinical Significance.', 'Current conundrums with cribriform prostate cancer.', 'Transcriptomics and Metabolomics Identify Drug Resistance of Dormant Cell in Colorectal Cancer.']"""

Objective:   To compare acute and late toxic effects among patients with cancer and comorbid CVD who received dose-fractionated radiotherapy.  Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective cohort study examined 197 adult patients with cancer and CVD who received radiotherapy at a single-institution tertiary academic center over a 12-year period (February 1, 2007, to April 30, 2019), with a median follow-up of 23 months (range, 0-108 months). Data were analyzed from February 1 to August 31, 2020.  Exposures:   Three dose-fractionated radiotherapy regimens: conventional fractionation (CF; ≤2 Gy per fraction), moderate hypofractionation (MH; >2 Gy to <5 Gy per fraction), and ultrahypofractionation (UH; ≥5 Gy per fraction).  Main outcomes and measures:   The main outcomes were the incidence and severity of acute and late radiotherapy-associated toxic effects, which were assessed separately by dose-fractionation regimen. Toxic effects occurring within 90 days after radiotherapy completion were considered acute, and toxic effects occurring after that 90-day period were considered late. Secondary goals were to identify covariates associated with toxic effects and to characterize the incidence of CVD symptom flares (defined as worsening clinical symptoms and/or worsening results [transient or permanent] on associated blood tests compared with baseline, as documented by managing physicians) after radiotherapy.  Results:   Of 197 patients with cancer and comorbid CVD (mean [SD] age, 69 [12] years; 134 women [68.0%]; and 149 White participants [75.6%]), 80 patients (40.6%) received CF radiotherapy, 55 patients (27.9%) received MH radiotherapy, and 62 patients (31.5%) received UH radiotherapy. The most common CVD diagnoses were rheumatoid arthritis (74 patients [37.6%]), psoriasis (54 patients [27.4%]), systemic lupus erythematosus (34 patients [17.3%]), and scleroderma (8 patients [4.1%]). The most common radiotherapy sites were the breast (48 patients [24.4%]), thorax (25 patients [12.7%]), central nervous system (24 patients [12.2%]), and prostate (23 patients [11.7%]). Data on acute toxic effects were available for 188 patients (95.4%) and missing for 9 patients (4.6%). Data on late toxic effects were available for 142 patients (72.1%) and missing for 55 patients (27.9%). Over 12 years, the unadjusted incidences of severe acute toxic effects associated with CF, MH, and UH radiotherapy were 5.4% (95% CI, 0.3%-10.5%), 7.4% (95% CI, 0.4%-14.4%), and 1.7% (95% CI, 0%-5.0%), respectively. The incidences of severe late toxic effects associated with CF, MH, and UH radiotherapy were 8.3% (95% CI, 1.3%-15.3%), 0%, and 2.2% (95% CI, 0%-6.4%), respectively. No significant associations were found between severe acute or late toxic effects by dose fractionation regimen. In the multivariable analysis, MH radiotherapy was associated with a lower likelihood of developing late toxic effects (odds ratio [OR], 0.21; 95% CI, 0.05-0.83; P = .03) compared with CF radiotherapy. Those who received UH radiotherapy had a lower likelihood of experiencing late toxic effects (OR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.04-1.21; P = .08).

However, owing to the dichotomized nature of metastatic burden criteria, it is not clear how this benefit varies with bone metastasis counts and metastatic site.  Objective:   To evaluate the association of bone metastasis count and location with survival benefit from prostate RT.  Design, setting, and participants:   This exploratory analysis of treatment outcomes based on metastatic site and extent as determined by conventional imaging (computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging and bone scan) evaluated patients with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer randomized within the STAMPEDE trial's metastasis M1 RT comparison. The association of baseline bone metastasis counts with overall survival (OS) and failure-free survival (FFS) was assessed using a multivariable fractional polynomial interaction procedure. Further analysis was conducted in subgroups.  Interventions:   Patients were randomized to receive either standard of care (androgen deprivation therapy with or without docetaxel) or standard of care and prostate RT.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcomes were OS and FFS.  Results:   A total of 1939 of 2061 men were included (median [interquartile range] age, 68 [63-73] years); 1732 (89%) had bone metastases. Bone metastasis counts were associated with OS and FFS benefit from prostate RT. Survival benefit decreased continuously as the number of bone metastases increased, with benefit most pronounced up to 3 bone metastases. A plot of estimated treatment effect indicated that the upper 95% CI crossed the line of equivalence (hazard ratio [HR], 1) above 3 bone metastases without a detectable change point. Further analysis based on subgroups showed that the magnitude of benefit from the addition of prostate RT was greater in patients with low metastatic burden with only nonregional lymph nodes (M1a) or 3 or fewer bone metastases without visceral metastasis (HR for OS, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.46-0.83; HR for FFS, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.47-0.70) than among patients with 4 or more bone metastases or any visceral/other metastasis (HR for OS, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.91-1.28; interaction P = .003; HR for FFS, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76-0.99; interaction P = .002).

Therefore, our aim was to quantify the direct effect of ePLND versus nePLND (removal of occult micrometastases), which is not mediated through the detection of nodal disease and potential adjuvant therapy (indirect effect).  Methods:   Retrospective, bi-center cohort study of consecutive patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and PLND for PC (January 2006 and December 2016). Patients were followed until April 2018 for the occurrence of either biochemical recurrence or secondary therapy (composite outcome). ePLND was compared to nePLND by unweighted and weighted survival analysis (total effect) as well as by causal mediation analysis (direct and indirect effect).  Results:   Positive nodal disease was detected in 71 (7%) out of 1008 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and PLND for PC (ePLND: 368 [36.5%]; nePLND: 640 [63.5%]).

The causal mediation analysis confirmed the total effect of 0.77 (0.71-0.82). After disentangling this total effect into an indirect effect (via detection of nodal disease and potential adjuvant therapy) and a direct effect (via removal of occult micrometastases), we identified an even more protective direct effect of 0.69 (0.63-0.75).

Methods:   Germline DNA from 325 PrCa patients (median age at diagnosis: 57 years old) was screened for BRCA2 mutation. The mutation frequency was compared between three subgroups: patients with an age at diagnosis at 55 years old and under (Group I); a personal or family history of breast, uterine or ovarian cancer (Group II); or a metastatic disease (Group III). Frequency of BRCA2 mutations was established for each combination of phenotypes, and compared between patients meeting or not the criteria for each subgroup using Fisher's exact test. Mutual information, direct effect, elasticity and contribution to the mutational status of each phenotype, taking into account overlap between subgroups, were also estimated using Bayesian algorithms.  Results:   The proportion of BRCA2 mutation was 5.9% in Group I, 10.9% in Group II and 6.9% in Group III. The frequency of BRCA2 mutation was significantly higher among patients of Group II (p = .006), and reached 15.6% among patients of this group who presented a metastatic disease.

Sex steroid hormones influence cardiac ion channels. However, few studies have examined the proarrhythmic properties of medical castration. Methods and Results This study included 149 patients who underwent medical castration using gonadotropin-releasing hormones with/without antiandrogen for prostate cancer. The changes in the ECG findings during the therapy and associations of the electrocardiographic findings with malignant arrhythmias were studied. The QT and corrected QT (QTc) intervals prolonged during the therapy compared with baseline (QT, 394±32 to 406±39 ms [P<0.001]; QTc, 416±27 to 439±31 ms [P<0.001]). The QTc interval was prolonged in 119 (79.9%) patients during the therapy compared with baseline. In 2 (1.3%) patients who had no structural heart disease, torsade de pointes (TdP) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) occurred ≥6 months after starting the therapy. In patients with TdP/VF, the increase in the QTc interval from the pretreatment value was >80 ms. However, in patients without TdP/VF, the prevalence of an increase in the QTc interval from the pretreatment value of >50 ms was 11%, and an increase in the QTc interval from the pretreatment value >80 ms was found in only 4 (3%) patients. Conclusions Medical castration prolongs the QT/QTc intervals in most patients with prostate cancer, and it could cause TdP/VFs even in patients with no risk of QT prolongation before the therapy. An increase in the QTc interval from the pretreatment value >50 ms might become a predictor of TdP/VF. Much attention should be paid to the QTc interval throughout all periods of medical castration to prevent malignant arrhythmias.""","""['Kanae Hasegawa', 'Hideaki Ito', 'Kenichi Kaseno', 'Shinsuke Miyazaki', 'Yuichiro Shiomi', 'Naoto Tama', 'Hiroyuki Ikeda', 'Kentaro Ishida', 'Hiroyasu Uzui', 'Seiko Ohno', 'Minoru Horie', 'Osamu Yokoyama', 'Hiroshi Tada']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Am Heart Assoc""","""['The Role of Testosterone and Gonadotropins in Arrhythmogenesis.', 'Medical Castration is a Rare but Possible Trigger of Torsade de Pointes and Ventricular Fibrillation.', 'Electrocardiographic Parameters Indicating Worse Evolution in Patients with Acquired Long QT Syndrome and Torsades de Pointes.', 'Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, ischaemic ventricular fibrillation, and torsade de pointes: importance of the QT and the coupling interval in the differential diagnosis.', 'Proarrhythmic risk with antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs: implications in the elderly.', 'QTc interval prolongation and antipsychotic drug treatments: focus on sertindole.', 'Fir(e)ing the Rhythm: Inflammatory Cytokines and Cardiac Arrhythmias.', 'Transient Hypogonadism Is Associated With Heart Rate-Corrected QT Prolongation and Torsades de Pointes Risk During Active Systemic Inflammation in Men.', 'The Role of Testosterone and Gonadotropins in Arrhythmogenesis.']"""

Methods:   Between 2009 and 2017, data were collected from all men aged 40-79 years, who had a prostate-specific antigen test in the northern region of New Zealand, where the prostate-specific antigen testing service is provided by a single community laboratory and using the same assay analyzer. Men known to have prostate cancer, who developed prostate cancer during the study period, who were treated with finasteride, or who had prostate-specific antigen levels above 20 ng/mL were excluded. Age-adjusted prostate-specific antigen reference values were calculated for each of the main ethnic groups in the country including: Māori (indigenous), Pacific, Asian and European. For every 5-year age interval, the 95th percentile of the log prostate-specific antigen distribution was used to define the upper limit of normal.  Results:   The study cohort included 215 132 apparently healthy men, with a median age and prostate-specific antigen concentration of 59 years and 0.9 ng/mL, respectively. Prostate-specific antigen levels for the entire cohort increased with age (Pearson correlation = 0.362, P < 0.001). This relationship was most prominent in Pacific men. Similarly, the upper reference limit for the entire cohort increased with age, from 1.60 ng/mL for men aged 40-44 years to 7.61 ng/mL for those aged 75-79 years.

Herein, we investigate microRNA (miR-21) suppression on the doxorubicin (DOX)-sensitisation of the DOX-resistant (PC3/DOX) cell line in prostate cancer (PCa). Expression levels of miR-21, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), MDR-1 and PTEN evaluated in PC3/DOX cancer cells by qRT-PCR and western blot analyses. The cytotoxic effects of transfected of miR-21 were assessed by MTT assay for 72 hr. Rhodamine123 (Rh123) assay was employed to define the activity of P-gp. Apoptosis was detected by Flow cytometry. As expected, miR-21 was expressed highly in PC3/DOX cells (p < 0.05). It was shown that miRNA-21 suppression considerably hindered PC3/DOX cell viability. miR-21 suppression dramatically downregulated P-gp expression and activity in DOX-resistance cells and abolished MDR by an increment of intracellular accumulation of DOX in PC3/DOX cells (p < 0.05). PTEN is a key modulator of the PI3K/Akt/P-gp cascade, which miR-21 suppression led to the upregulation of PTEN and sequentially lower-expression of P-gp that reversed MDR. Also, miR-21 repression enhanced the apoptosis rate of PC3/DOX cells.

Previous studies of radiomic feature analysis for prostate cancer were assessed in a variety of imaging modalities, including MRI, PET, and CT, but usually limited to a pretreatment setting. However, CBCT images may provide an opportunity to capture early morphological changes to the tumor during treatment that could lead to timely treatment adaptation. This work investigated the quality of CBCT-based radiomic features and their relationship with reconstruction methods applied to the CBCT projections and the preprocessing methods used in feature extraction. Moreover, CBCT features were correlated with planning CT (pCT) features to further assess the viability of CBCT radiomic features.  Methods:   The quality of 42 CBCT-based radiomic features was assessed according to their repeatability and reproducibility. Repeatability was quantified by correlating radiomic features between 20 CBCT scans that also had repeated scans within 15 minutes. Reproducibility was quantified by correlating radiomic features between the planning CT (pCT) and the first fraction CBCT for 20 patients. Concordance correlation coefficients (CCC) of radiomic features were used to estimate the repeatability and reproducibility of radiomic features. The same patient dataset was assessed using different reconstruction methods applied to the CBCT projections. CBCT images were generated using 18 reconstruction methods using iterative (iCBCT) and standard (sCBCT) reconstructions, three convolution filters, and five noise suppression filters. Eighteen preprocessing settings were also considered.  Results:   Overall, CBCT radiomic features were more repeatable than reproducible. Five radiomic features are repeatable in > 97% of the reconstruction and preprocessing methods, and come from the gray-level size zone matrix (GLSZM), neighborhood gray-tone difference matrix (NGTDM), and gray-level-run length matrix (GLRLM) radiomic feature classes. These radiomic features were reproducible in > 9.8% of the reconstruction and preprocessing methods. Noise suppression and convolution filter smoothing increased radiomic features repeatability, but decreased reproducibility. The top-repeatable iCBCT method (iCBCT-Sharp-VeryHigh) is more repeatable than the top-repeatable sCBCT method (sCBCT-Smooth) in 64% of the radiomic features.  Conclusion:   Methods for reconstruction and preprocessing that improve CBCT radiomic feature repeatability often decrease reproducibility. The best approach may be to use methods that strike a balance repeatability and reproducibility such as iCBCT-Sharp-VeryLow-1-Lloyd-256 that has 17 repeatable and eight reproducible radiomic features. Previous radiomic studies that only used pCT radiomic features have generated prognostic models of prostate cancer outcome. Since our study indicates that CBCT radiomic features correlated well with a subset of pCT radiomic features, one may expect CBCT radiomics to also generate prognostic models for prostate cancer.""","""['Rodrigo Delgadillo', 'Benjamin O Spieler', 'John C Ford', 'Deukwoo Kwon', 'Fei Yang', 'Matthew Studenski', 'Kyle R Padgett', 'Matthew C Abramowitz', 'Alan Dal Pra', 'Radka Stoyanova', 'Alan Pollack', 'Nesrin Dogan']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Reproducibility of F18-FDG PET radiomic features for different cervical tumor segmentation methods, gray-level discretization, and reconstruction algorithms.', 'Identification of reproducible radiomic features from on-board volumetric images: A multi-institutional phantom study.', 'Cardiac SPECT radiomic features repeatability and reproducibility: A multi-scanner phantom study.', 'The role of radiomics in prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'A systematic review and quality of reporting checklist for repeatability and reproducibility of radiomic features.', 'Development and optimisation of a preclinical cone beam computed tomography-based radiomics workflow for radiation oncology research.', 'Cone-beam CT delta-radiomics to predict genitourinary toxicities and international prostate symptom of prostate cancer patients: a pilot study.', 'Radiomics in prostate cancer: an up-to-date review.', 'Assessing radiomics feature stability with simulated CT acquisitions.', 'Assessment of CT to CBCT contour mapping for radiomic feature analysis in prostate cancer.']"""

Dysregulation of BRG1 is observed, but functionally uncharacterised, in a wide range of malignancies. We have probed the functions of BRG1 on a background of prostate cancer to investigate how BRG1 controls gene expression programmes and cancer cell behaviour.  Results:   Our investigation of SMARCA4 revealed that BRG1 is over-expressed in the majority of the 486 tumours from The Cancer Genome Atlas prostate cohort, as well as in a complementary panel of 21 prostate cell lines. Next, we utilised a temporal model of BRG1 depletion to investigate the molecular effects on global transcription programmes. Depleting BRG1 had no impact on alternative splicing and conferred only modest effect on global expression. However, of the transcriptional changes that occurred, most manifested as down-regulated expression. Deeper examination found the common thread linking down-regulated genes was involvement in proliferation, including several known to increase prostate cancer proliferation (KLK2, PCAT1 and VAV3). Interestingly, the promoters of genes driving proliferation were bound by BRG1 as well as the transcription factors, AR and FOXA1.

While it is known that increases in select lipids correlate to decreased survival, neither the mechanisms mediating these alterations nor the correlation of resistance to drug treatments is well characterized.  Methods:   This gap-in-knowledge was addressed using in vitro models of non-cancerous, hormone-sensitive, CRPC and drug-resistant cell lines combined with quantitative LC-ESI-Orbitrap-MS (LC-ESI-MS/MS) lipidomic analysis and subsequent analysis such as Metaboanalyst and Lipid Pathway Enrichment Analysis (LIPEA).  Results:   Several lipid regulatory pathways were identified that are associated with Docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer (PCa). These included those controlling glycerophospholipid metabolism, sphingolipid signaling and ferroptosis. In total, 7460 features were identified as being dysregulated between the cell lines studied, and 21 lipid species were significantly altered in drug-resistant cell lines as compared to nonresistant cell lines. Docetaxel resistance cells (PC3-Rx and DU145-DR) had higher levels of phosphatidylcholine (PC), oxidized lipid species, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and sphingomyelin (SM) as compared to parent control cells (PC-3 and DU-145). Alterations were also identified in the levels of phosphatidic acid (PA) and diacylglyceride (DAG), whose levels are regulated by Lipin (LPIN), a phosphatidic acid phosphatase that converts PA to DAG. Data derived from cBioPortal demonstrated a population of PCa patients expressing mutations aligning with amplification of LPIN1, LPIN2 and LPIN3 genes. Lipin amplification in these genes correlated to decreased survival in these patients. Lipin-1 mRNA expression also showed a similar trend in PCa patient data. Lipin-1, but not Lipin-2 or - 3, was detected in several prostate cancer cells, and was increased in 22RV1 and PC-3 cell lines. The increased expression of Lipin-1 in these cells correlated with the level of PA.  Conclusion:   These data identify lipids whose levels may correlate to Docetaxel sensitivity and progression of PCa. The data also suggest a correlation between the expression of Lipin-1 in cells and patients with regards to prostate cancer cell aggressiveness and patient survivability. Ultimately, these data may be useful for identifying markers of lethal and/or metastatic prostate cancer.""","""['Lishann M Ingram', 'Morgan C Finnerty#', 'Maryam Mansoura#', 'Chau-Wen Chou', 'Brian S Cummings']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Lipids Health Dis""","""['Overexpression of claspin promotes docetaxel resistance and is associated with prostate-specific antigen recurrence in prostate cancer.', 'Lipin-1 regulates cancer cell phenotype and is a potential target to potentiate rapamycin treatment.', 'Cdc20/p55 mediates the resistance to docetaxel in castration-resistant prostate cancer in a Bim-dependent manner.', 'Mechanisms of docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer: The key role played by miRNAs.', 'Research and development of Lipin family..', 'Untargeted lipidomic analysis and network pharmacology for parthenolide treated papillary thyroid carcinoma cells.', 'FACS-assisted single-cell lipidome analysis of phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins in cells of different lineages.', 'Dihydroceramide desaturase 1 (DES1) promotes anchorage-independent survival downstream of HER2-driven glucose uptake and metabolism.', 'Omics Analysis of Chemoresistant Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cells Reveals Novel Metabolic Vulnerabilities.', ""Role of Lipids and Lipid Metabolism in Prostate Cancer Progression and the Tumor's Immune Environment.""]"""

However, whether a prior cancer history has an adversely impact on clinical outcomes for patients with advanced prostate cancer (APC) remains largely unknown. We therefore aimed to investigate the impact of prior cancer history on these patients.  Methods:   We identified patients with advanced prostate cancer diagnosed from 2004 to 2010 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance baseline characteristics. Kaplan-Meier method and the Cox proportional hazard model were utilized for survival analysis.  Results:   A total of 19,772 eligible APC patients were included, of whom 887 (4.5 %) had a history of prior cancer. Urinary bladder (19 %), colon and cecum (16 %), melanoma of the skin (9 %) malignancies, and non-hodgkin lymphoma (9 %) were the most common types of prior cancer. Patients with a history of prior cancer had slightly inferior overall survival (OS) (AHR = 1.13; 95 % CI [1.02-1.26]; P = 0.017) as compared with that of patients without a prior cancer diagnosis. Subgroup analysis further indicated that a history of prior cancer didn't adversely impact patients' clinical outcomes, except in patients with a prior cancer diagnosed within 2 years, at advanced stage, or originating from specific sites, including bladder, colon and cecum, or lung and bronchus, or prior chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  Conclusions:   A large proportion of APC patients with a prior cancer history had non-inferior survival to that of patients without a prior cancer diagnosis.

Recent studies suggest long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) may be potential targets to develop drugs. However, PCa bone metastasis-specifically-related lncRNAs were rarely reported. This study aimed to identify crucial lncRNAs and reveal their function mechanisms.  Methods:   GSE32269 and GSE26964 microarray datasets, downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, were used to analyze differentially expressed genes (DEGs)/lncRNAs (DELs) and miRNAs (DEMs), respectively. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was performed to screen PCa bone metastasis-associated modules. The co-expression and competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) networks were constructed to identify hub lncRNAs. Univariate Cox regression analysis was conducted to determine their prognostic values. The correlation of lncRNAs with immune infiltrating cells was analyzed by using Tumor IMmune Estimation Resource. Therapeutic drugs were predicted by querying the Connectivity Map (CMap) and the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD).  Results:   A total of 18 DELs, 2,614 DEGs and 86 DEMs were screened between bone metastatic and primary PCa samples. Four modules enriched by DEGs were shown to be bone metastasis-associated. LncRNA HCG18 and MCM3AP-AS1 were identified to be important because they existed in both of the co-expression and ceRNA networks (forming the relationship pairs: HCG18/MCM3AP-AS1-KNTC1, MCM3AP-AS1-hsa-miR-508-3p-DTL and HCG18/MCM3AP-AS1-hsa-miR-127-3p-CDKN3). All the genes in these interaction pairs were significantly associated with overall survival of PCa patients. Also, HCG18, MCM3AP-AS1 and their target mRNAs were positively correlated with various tumor-infiltrated immune cells, especially increased M2 macrophages. Valproic acid and trichostatin A may be effective to treat PCa bone metastasis by targeting HCG18 and MCM3AP-AS1.  Conclusion:   HCG18 and MCM3AP-AS1 that regulate M2 macrophage infiltration may be important targets to treat PCa bone metastasis and improve prognosis.""","""['Yanfang Chen', 'Zheng Chen', 'Jian Mo', 'Mao Pang', 'Zihao Chen', 'Feng Feng', 'Peigen Xie', 'Bu Yang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['Excavating novel diagnostic and prognostic long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: an integrated bioinformatics analysis of competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) and gene co-expression networks.', 'A ceRNA network of BBOX1-AS1-hsa-miR-125b-5p/hsa-miR-125a-5p-CDKN2A shows prognostic value in cervical cancer.', 'A novel lncRNA MCM3AP-AS1 promotes the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma by targeting miR-194-5p/FOXA1 axis.', 'Identification of MFI2-AS1, a Novel Pivotal lncRNA for Prognosis of Stage III/IV Colorectal Cancer.', 'The role of LncRNA MCM3AP-AS1 in human cancer.', 'Prognostic values of long noncoding RNA in bone metastasis of prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The regulatory role of LncRNA HCG18 in various cancers.', 'A Novel Blood Proteomic Signature for Prostate Cancer.', 'The role of long non-coding RNA HCG18 in cancer.', ""From HDAC to Voltage-Gated Ion Channels: What's Next?

Unraveling the composition of EV cargos remains one of the most fundamental steps toward understanding the role of EVs in intercellular communication and the discovery of new biomarkers. One of the unmet needs in this field is the lack of a robust, sensitive, and multiplexed method for EV mRNA profiling. We established a new protocol using the NanoString low RNA input nCounter assay by which the targeted mRNA transcripts in EVs can be efficiently and specifically amplified and then assayed for 770 mRNAs in one reaction. Prostate cancer cells with epithelial (PC3-Epi) or mesenchymal (PC3-EMT) phenotypes and their progeny EVs were analyzed by the same panel. Among these mRNAs, 157 were detected in PC3-Epi EVs and 564 were detected in PC3-EMT EVs. NOTCH1 was the most significantly abundant mRNA transcripts in PC3-EMT EVs compared to PC3-Epi EVs. Our results demonstrated that when cells undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a more active loading of cancer progression-related mRNA transcripts may occur. The mRNA cargos of EVs derived from mesenchymal prostate cancer cells may contribute to the pro-EMT function. We found that mRNA transcripts are different in progeny EVs compared to parental cells. EV cargos are not completely reflective of their cell origin, and the underlying mechanism of cargo sorting is complicated and needs to be further elucidated.""","""['Liang Dong', 'Chung-Ying Huang', 'Eric J Johnson', 'Lei Yang', 'Richard C Zieren', 'Kengo Horie', 'Chi-Ju Kim', 'Sarah Warren', 'Sarah R Amend', 'Wei Xue', 'Kenneth J Pienta']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['Distinct prostate cancer-related mRNA cargo in extracellular vesicle subsets from prostate cell lines.', 'High-throughput sequencing of two populations of extracellular vesicles provides an mRNA signature that can be detected in the circulation of breast cancer patients.', 'Cavin-1/PTRF alters prostate cancer cell-derived extracellular vesicle content and internalization to attenuate extracellular vesicle-mediated osteoclastogenesis and osteoblast proliferation.', 'Extracellular vesicles for liquid biopsy in prostate cancer: where are we and where are we headed?', 'Extracellular vesicles: their role in cancer biology and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'Combination of RCA and DNAzyme for Dual-Signal Isothermal Amplification of Exosome RNA.', 'Novel urinary tract obstruction marker discovery by multi-marker profiling of urinary extracellular vesicles derived from a rat UTO model.', 'RNA profiling of circulating tumor cells systemically captured from diagnostic leukapheresis products in prostate cancer patients.', 'Multiplexed mRNA analysis of brain-derived extracellular vesicles upon experimental stroke in mice reveals increased mRNA content with potential relevance to inflammation and recovery processes.', 'The promising role of new molecular biomarkers in prostate cancer: from coding and non-coding genes to artificial intelligence approaches.']"""

However, the clinical characteristics and biological functions of CLSPN in prostate cancer (PCa) are still to be clarified. The aim of our study was to evaluate the association of CLSPN expression during PCa progression and its potential role in prognosis. Methods: We analyzed mRNA expression of the CLSPN gene with various clinicopathological features using the Cancer Genome Atlas and GSE21032 dataset. Immunohistochemical assays were used to detect the protein expression levels of CLSPN in human PCa tissue microarrays. Furthermore, we characterized the role of CLSPN in PCa progression through in vitro experiments using a CLSPN knockout. Results: Immunohistochemistry and public datasets revealed that CLSPN expression was increased in PCa with: a high Gleason score; advanced pathological stage; and positive surgical margins. In addition, upregulation of CLSPN was correlated with shorter biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival and overall survival. After we knocked-out CLSPN in DU145 and LNCaP cells, the in vitro phenotypic results showed that the ability of the knockouts to proliferate, migrate, and invade was attenuated; but that apoptosis was promoted. Conclusions: Our data support an oncogenic role for CLSPN in PCa progression.

Methods:   For this prospective study, men who had localized prostate cancer in 2011 and 2012 were enrolled. Assessments at baseline, 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 years included the patient-reported Expanded Prostate Index Composite, the 36-item Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form Health Survey, and treatment-related regret. Regression models were adjusted for baseline function and for patient and treatment characteristics. The minimum clinically important difference in scores on the Expanded Prostate Index Composite 26-item instrument was from 5 to 7 for urinary irritation and from 4 to 6 for bowel function.  Results:   Six-hundred ninety-five men met inclusion criteria and received either EBRT (n = 583) or EBRT-LDR (n = 112). Patients in the EBRT-LDR group were younger (median age, 66 years [interquartile range [IQR], 60-71 years] vs 69 years [IQR, 64-74 years]; P < .001), were less likely to receive pelvic radiotherapy (10% vs 18%; P = .040), and had higher baseline 36-item Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form Health Survey physical function scores (median score, 95 [IQR, 86-100] vs 90 [IQR, 70-100]; P < .001). Over a 3-year period, compared with EBRT, EBRT-LDR was associated with worse urinary irritative scores (adjusted mean difference at 3 years, -5.4; 95% CI, -9.3, -1.6) and bowel function scores (-4.1; 95% CI, -7.6, -0.5). The differences were no longer clinically meaningful at 5 years (difference in urinary irritative scores: -4.5; 95% CI, -8.4, -0.5; difference in bowel function scores: -2.1; 95% CI, -5.7, -1.4). However, men who received EBRT-LDR were more likely to report moderate or big problems with urinary function bother (adjusted odds ratio, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.5-8.2) and frequent urination (adjusted odds ratio, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.2-5.6) through 5 years. There were no differences in survival or treatment-related regret between treatment groups.  Conclusions:   Compared with EBRT alone, EBRT-LDR was associated with clinically meaningful worse urinary irritative and bowel function over 3 years after treatment and more urinary bother at 5 years.  Lay summary:   In men with prostate cancer who received external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) with or without a brachytherapy boost (EBRT-LDR), EBRT-LDR was associated with clinically worse urinary irritation and bowel function through 3 years but resolved after 5 years. Men who received EBRT-LDR continued to report moderate-to-big problems with urinary function bother and frequent urination through 5 years. There was no difference in treatment-related regret or survival between patients who received EBRT and those who received EBRT-LDR.

For each approach exposure times were 5 (groups 1 and 4), 10 (groups 2 and 5) and 20 (groups 3 and 6) min, respectively. The control group (7) received PPNB only. Patients filled a 0-10 visual analogue scale (VAS) at five points: after probe insertion, during probe manipulation, following PPNB, after prostate biopsies and a global pain estimation.  Results:   Two hundred and fifty-two patients were enrolled. Significant differences in VAS between all study groups and controls were observed at the pre-biopsy stages of the procedure. In multivariate analysis adjusted for prostate specific antigen, diabetes mellitus status, spinal disease, abnormal digital rectal examination and non- benign prostate hyperplasia histology, significance remained for probe insertion and intra-rectal manipulation. For each exposure time no significant differences were observed between topical application and topical + intra-rectal application. After PPNB, differences between study and control groups disappeared.  Conclusion:   Topical anesthesia significantly reduces pain during early stages of prostate biopsy. Perianal application sufficed whereas intra-rectal application of local anesthetics does not add to pain control. Perianal application for 10 min seems to be optimal.""","""['Yishai H Rappaport', 'Sergey Kravchick', 'Amos Neheman', 'Ilia Beberashvili', 'Kobi Stav', 'Shmuel Roizman', 'Amnon Zisman']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Scand J Urol""","""['Combined perianal-intrarectal (PI) lidocaine-prilocaine (LP) cream and lidocaine-ketorolac gel provide better pain relief than combined PI LP cream and periprostatic nerve block during transrectal prostate biopsy.', 'Is only perianal anesthesia with lidocaine-prilocaine cream sufficient to decrease the pain during transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy?

Objectives:   To investigate oncologic outcomes of patients with cT3 prostate cancer treated by RALP.  Methods:   Medical records of patients who underwent RALP from 2010 to 2018 were retrieved. cT3 cases were reviewed. Demographic and pre/postoperative pathology data were analyzed. Patients were followed in 3-6 month intervals with repeat PSA analyses. Adjuvant/salvage treatments were monitored. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) meant PSA levels of ≥ 0.2 ng/ml.  Results:   Seventy-nine patients met inclusion criteria. Median age at surgery was 64 years. Preoperative PSA level was 7.14 ng/dl, median prostate weight was 54 grams, and 23 cases (29.1%) were down-staged to pathological stage T2. Positive surgical margin rate was 42%. Five patients were lost to follow-up. Median follow-up time for the remaining 74 patients was 24 months. Postoperative relapse in PSA levels occurred in 31 patients (42%), and BCR in 28 (38%). Median time to BCR was 9 months. The overall 5-year BCR-free survival rate was 61%. Predicting factors for BCR were age (hazard-ratio [HR] 0.85, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 0.74-0.97, P = 0.017) and prostate weight (HR 1.04, 95%CI 1.01-1.08, P = 0.021). Twenty-six patients (35%) received adjuvant/salvage treatments. Three patients died from metastatic prostate cancer 31, 52, and 78 months post-surgery. Another patient died 6 months post-surgery of unknown reasons. The 5-year cancer-specific survival rate was 92.  Conclusions:   RALP is an oncologic effective procedure for cT3 prostate cancer.

However, recent well-designed studies have revealed a potential clinical value in lung cancer. We analysed the diagnostic accuracy of a panel of 11 circulating TMs with clinically controlled thresholds in the differentiation of cancer from nonmalignant diseases.  Methods:   We prospectively recruited 4776 consecutive patients presenting with focal or nonspecific symptoms suggestive of cancer who underwent testing for 11 serum TMs before diagnosis was known. The study abided by 2015 STARD guidelines. Tumour markers included, among others, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, carcinoembryonic antigen, alpha-fetoprotein, squamous cell carcinoma-associated antigen, prostate-specific antigen (males), neuron-specific enolase, progastrin-releasing peptide and carbohydrate antigen 125. Thresholds were adjusted for the presence of kidney failure, liver disease, effusions and dermatological disorders. Results showing ≥1 TMs with concentrations above threshold were considered positive.  Results:   Benign diseases were diagnosed in 3281 (68.7%) patients and cancer in 1495 (31.3%), with epithelial cancers in 1214 (77% at stage IV). When applying criteria for controlled thresholds, overall specificity was 98%. Overall sensitivity of the panel in epithelial cancers was 72.2%, positive predictive value 93% and negative predictive value 90.5%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.920 (95% confidence interval, 0.902-0.924).  Conclusions:   By using clinically controlled cut-offs, the combined panel demonstrated an excellent ability to discriminate epithelial cancers from nonmalignant diseases.

Core-type fucosylated-free PSA was measured by our automated microcapillary electrophoresis-based immunoassay system with Pholiota squarrosa lectin. The FPI was calculated from total PSA and the percentage of fucosylated-free PSA. The optimum model to predict Gleason grade (GG) ≥2 was constructed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Discrimination was assessed by determining the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). The study included 252 men who underwent prostate needle biopsy due to elevated serum PSA levels (4-20 ng/mL), including 138 with GG ≥2. A higher FPI was significantly associated with GG (P < .0001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, prostate volume and FPI were significant predictors of GG ≥2. The AUC of FPI and the model were 0.729 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.668-0.790) and 0.837 (95% CI: 0.788-0.886), respectively, compared to 0.629 (95% CI: 0.561-0.698) for PSA.

Methods The study was conducted in two parts. In part 1, dose-escalation using a standard 3 + 3 design was performed in two dosing schedules (every week (QW) and every 3 weeks (Q3W)). Part 2 was comprised of a dose expansion at 75 mg/m2 Q3W. PK studies were performed on both dosing schedules. Results Forty-two patients were recruited onto the study with a median age of 64(range 38-76); median number of prior systemic therapies was 5(range 0-10). Grade 3/4 treatment-related toxicities included: neutropenia (21.4 %), infusion related reaction (11.9 %), anemia (7.1 %), fatigue (4.8 %), diarrhea (4.8 %), and peripheral neuropathy (4.8 %). The maximum tolerated dose was 75 mg/m2 given on the Q3W schedule and was not determined on the QW schedule. In this heavily pre-treated population, four patients (12.9 %) achieved stable disease (SD) ≥ 4 months and 2 patients (6.5 %) achieved partial response (PR) for a clinical benefit rate (CBR) of 19.4 % (6/31 patients). The PRs were seen in prostate and breast adenocarcinoma (one each). CRLX301 exhibited some PK advantages over docetaxel including higher retention of drug in plasma, slower clearance and controlled slow release of docetaxel from the carrier. Conclusions In this heavily pretreated patient population, the safety profile was acceptable for CRLX301 therapy.

The GBR-NMF approach involves the deconstruction of Raman spectra into component biochemical bases using a library of Raman spectra of known biochemicals present in the cells. Subsequently, scores are obtained on each of these bases which can be directly correlated with the contribution of each chemical to the overall Raman spectrum. We validated GBR-NMF through the correlation of GBR-NMF-derived glycogen scores with scores that were previously observed using principal component analysis (PCA). Phosphatidylcholine, glucose, arginine and asparagine showed a distinct differential score pattern between radio-resistant and radio-sensitive cell types.

We thus sought to profile circulating angiokines in the context of a randomized treatment trial of everolimus versus sunitinib.  Patients and methods:   ASPEN (NCT01108445) was an international, randomized, open-label phase II trial of patients with metastatic papillary, chromophobe, or unclassified NC-RCC with no prior systemic therapy. Patients were randomized to everolimus or sunitinib and treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was radiographic progression-free survival (PFS) defined by RECIST 1.1. Plasma angiokines were collected at baseline, cycle 3, and progression and associated with PFS and overall survival (OS).  Results:   We enrolled 108 patients, 51 received sunitinib and 57 everolimus; of these, 99 patients had evaluable plasma for 23 angiokines. At the final data cutoff, 94 PFS and 64 mortality events had occurred. Angiokines that were independently adversely prognostic for OS were osteopontin (OPN), TIMP-1, thrombospondin-2 (TSP-2), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and VCAM-1, and these were also associated with poor-risk disease. Stromal derived factor 1 (SDF-1) was associated with improved survival. OPN was also significantly associated with worse PFS.

Observational studies have revealed strong risk reductions in metastasis and cancer-specific mortality with the use of beta-blockers in patients with some cancers. But observational studies of prostate cancer have reported conflicting results.  Objectives:   We examined the relationship of ADRB1 (Adrenoceptor beta 1) gene expression and ADRB2 (Adrenoceptor beta 2) gene expression with Forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1) gene expression in prostate cancer. We also analyzed survival data of solid tumor patients with respect to beta 1 (ADRB1) and beta 2 (ADRB2) adrenergic receptor gene expression.  Methods:   We examined the genomics of prostate cancer and other solid primary tumors in the GDC TCGA Prostate Cancer (PRAD) data set. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) contains the analysis of over 11,000 tumors from 33 of the most prevalent forms of cancer.  Results:   The presence of somatic mutations [Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small insertion/deletion polymorphism (INDELS)] in FOXA1 alters ADRB1 and ADRB2 gene expression. The correlation of FOXA1 gene expression with ADRB1 and ADRB2 gene expression is highly significant. Alterations in FOXA1 genes, ADRB1 genes, and ADRB2 genes are significantly co-occurrent, indicating that they may work in tandem to drive tumor formation and development. Increased ADRB1 and ADRB2 expressions reduce the overall survival of solid tumor patients in the GDC Pan Cancer set.

The current diagnostic approach uses elevated serum concentrations of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as an indicator of risk. However, this test has been widely criticized as it shows poor specificity and sensitivity. In order to improve early detection and diagnosis, several studies have investigated whether different PSA proteoforms are correlated to prostate cancer. Until now, studies and methodologies for the comprehensive characterization of PSA proteoforms from biofluids are scarce. For this purpose, we developed an intact protein assay to analyze PSA by capillary electrophoresis-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry after affinity purification from patients' urine. Here, we determined six proteolytic cleavage variants. In regard to glycosylation, tri-, di-, mono- and non-sialylated complex-type N-glycans were found on non-cleaved PSA, as well as the non-glycosylated variant. The performance of the intact protein assay was assessed using a pooled sample, obtaining an inter-day variability of 15%. Furthermore, urinary patient samples were analyzed by intact protein analysis and a bottom-up approach (glycopeptide analysis). This combined approach revealed complimentary information on both levels, demonstrating the benefit of using two orthogonal techniques to provide a thorough profile of urinary PSA. SIGNIFICANCE: The detection of clinically relevant prostate cancer requires a more specific and sensitive biomarker and, in this case, several PSA proteoforms may be able to aid or improve the current PSA test. However, a comprehensive analysis of the intact PSA proteoform profile is still lacking. This study investigated the PSA proteoforms present in urine and, in particular, determined the relative contribution of cleaved PSA and non-cleaved PSA forms to the total glycosylation profile. Importantly, intact protein analysis did not require further sample treatment before being measured by CE-ESI-MS. Furthermore, its glycosylation was also assessed in a bottom-up approach to provide complementary information. Overall, these results represent an important basis for future characterization and biomarker studies.""","""['Alan B Moran', 'Elena Domínguez-Vega', 'Jan Nouta', 'Tamas Pongracz', 'Theo M de Reijke', 'Manfred Wuhrer', 'Guinevere S M Lageveen-Kammeijer']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Proteomics""","""['An In-Depth Glycosylation Assay for Urinary Prostate-Specific Antigen.', 'HILIC-MRM-MS for Linkage-Specific Separation of Sialylated Glycopeptides to Quantify Prostate-Specific Antigen Proteoforms.', 'Simultaneous analysis of glycosylated and sialylated prostate-specific antigen revealing differential distribution of glycosylated prostate-specific antigen isoforms in prostate cancer tissues.', 'Glycosylation of prostate specific antigen and its potential diagnostic applications.', 'Separation based characterization methods for the N-glycosylation analysis of prostate-specific antigen.', 'Software-Assisted Data Processing Workflow for Intact Glycoprotein Mass Spectrometry.', 'Immunoaffinity Capillary Electrophoresis in the Era of Proteoforms, Liquid Biopsy and Preventive Medicine: A Potential Impact in the Diagnosis and Monitoring of Disease Progression.', 'Current applications of capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry for the analysis of biologically important analytes in urine (2017 to mid-2021): A review.', 'High sensitivity glycomics in biomedicine.']"""

The incidence and mortality rates were calculated at the provincial, city, and forward sortation area (FSA) postal code levels by using population counts that were obtained from the Canadian Census of Population. The Canadian average incidence rate was 113.57 cases per 100,000 males. There has been an overall increasing trend in crude prostate cancer incidence between 1992 and 2010 with three peaks, in 1993, 2001, and 2007. However, age-adjusted incidence rates showed no significant increase over time. The national mortality rate was calculated to be 24.13 deaths per 100,000 males per year. A decrease was noted in crude and age-adjusted mortality rates between 1992 and 2010. Several provinces, cities, and FSAs had higher incidence/mortality rates than the national average. Several of the FSA postal codes with the highest incidence/mortality rates were adjacent to one another.

Materials and methods:   We prospectively enrolled men on active surveillance undergoing repeat biopsy from January 2016 to June 2019. Subjects underwent prostate multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and restriction spectrum imaging-magnetic resonance imaging reviewed by a urological radiologist for PI-RADS® scored lesions, followed by magnetic resonance imaging-guided prostate biopsy by a urologist. Restriction spectrum imaging-magnetic resonance imaging analysis with proprietary research software (CorTechs Labs, San Diego, California) generated a restricted signal map. We compared the restricted signal map and apparent diffusion coefficient values using T-test, ANOVA, and logistic regression analyses for prediction of upgrading.  Results:   Of 123 enrolled men we identified 74 restriction spectrum imaging-magnetic resonance imaging regions of interest (targeted lesions) in 110 subjects, with 105 subjects completing biopsy. The restricted signal map was significant per PI-RADS score for true-positive lesion detection (mean difference 28, SD 0.7, p=0.001), and better than apparent diffusion coefficient (mean difference -15, SD 55, p=0.6).

Exfoliated prostate cells captured in urine represent a promising resource for noninvasive detection of prostate cancer. We investigated performance of a novel cell-based urine test for detection of clinically significant prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We previously developed a multiplex RNA in situ hybridization assay targeting NKX3-1, PRAC1 and PCA3 that enables identification and quantification of malignant and benign prostate cells released into urine. We investigated application of the assay for prostate cancer detection in a cohort of 98 patients suspected of harboring prostate cancer. Urine was collected following digital rectal examination, and the sediment was isolated and evaluated by RNA in situ hybridization. Samples were scored based on cellular expression of RNA in situ hybridization targets. Cells of prostate origin were defined by positivity for NKX3-1 and/or PRAC1, and prostate cancer cells by positivity for PCA3.  Results:   Prostate cells (NKX3-1/PRAC1+ cells) were detected in 69 samples, among which 20 were positive for PCA3 (ie positive for prostate cancer cells). Comparison of RNA in situ hybridization results with biopsy outcome and clinical variables revealed that positivity for cancer by RNA in situ hybridization significantly correlated with intermediate/high risk cancer (p=0.003), PSA density (p=0.022), significant disease (p <0.0001) and Gleason score (p=0.003).

Very limited data are available on robotic salvage lymph node dissection. Our purpose was to investigate perioperative and oncological outcomes of robotic salvage lymph node dissection in a large monocentric series.  Materials and methods:   Perioperative data, complications within 30 days after surgery and oncological outcomes as assessed by histology, prostate specific antigen changes, prostate specific antigen nadir after salvage lymph node dissection, and time to further therapy were analyzed. To identify predictive factors for oncological outcome, Kaplan-Meier and Cox-regression analyses were performed. For cases with a mismatch between preoperative positron emission tomography/computed tomography and the number of histologically positive lymph nodes, prostate specific membrane antigen immunohistochemistry was performed on removed lymph nodes.  Results:   A total of 68 patients underwent robotic salvage lymph node dissection with a median operation time of 126 minutes, a blood loss of 50 ml, and a length of stay of 4 days. No major complications (>Clavien 3) occurred. Median followup was 12.1 months. Median time to further therapy was 12.4 months, 37% of patients experienced complete biochemical response (prostate specific antigen <0.2 ng/ml) and 11% reached an undetectable prostate specific antigen, which was maintained for >1 year in 3 cases. Lower preoperative prostate specific antigen, longer time between radical prostatectomy and salvage lymph node dissection, preoperative prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography and complete biochemical response after salvage lymph node dissection were significant predictors of longer therapy-free survival (all p <0.005). Prostate specific membrane antigen immunohistochemistry revealed that prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography tends to miss small lymph node metastases <5 mm.

Given differences in the incidence of bladder cancer among racial/ethnic groups, it is important to determine whether the effect of finasteride use on bladder cancer varies by race/ethnicity.  Materials and methods:   We identified all patients with a diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia between 2000 and 2016 at our academic health center in Bronx, New York via an electronic medical record database. We then identified patients who were prescribed finasteride, and those who developed bladder cancer during followup. We used competing risk analysis to examine associations of finasteride use with risk of bladder cancer, adjusting for age, smoking and race/ethnicity.  Results:   We identified 42,406 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (average±SD age 67±12.9 years), of whom 27.7% were Black and 14.8% were Hispanic. Finasteride was prescribed in 5,698 patients (13.4%). Bladder cancer was diagnosed in 84 of 5,698 finasteride users (1.5%), compared to 762 of 36,708 nonusers (2.1%, log-rank p=0.003). Finasteride was associated with a 36% reduction in risk of bladder cancer (HR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.51-0.80; p <0.0001) among all patients. When data were stratified by race/ethnicity, finasteride use was associated with a reduction in risk of bladder cancer in White men (HR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.43-0.86; p=0.005) and Hispanic men (HR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.21-0.90; p=0.026), but there was no association among Black men (HR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.67-1.51; p=0.964).  Conclusions:   Our study corroborates previous findings that men who are on finasteride have a lower bladder cancer incidence. However, the reduction in risk was seen only in White and Hispanic men, but not among Black men. Therefore, race/ethnicity represents an important stratification factor for future larger studies on finasteride as chemoprevention for bladder cancer.""","""['Denzel Zhu', 'Abhishek Srivastava', 'Ilir Agalliu', 'Ethan Fram', 'Evan Z Kovac', 'Ahmed Aboumohamed', 'Mark P Schoenberg', 'Alexander I Sankin']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Differences in Stage of Cancer at Diagnosis, Treatment, and Survival by Race and Ethnicity Among Leading Cancer Types.', 'Rates of prostate surgery and acute urinary retention for benign prostatic hyperplasia in men treated with dutasteride or finasteride.', 'Comparing Clinical and Economic Outcomes Associated with Early Initiation of Combination Therapy of an Alpha Blocker and Dutasteride or Finasteride in Men with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia in the United States.', 'Monotherapy versus combination drug therapy for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'The clinical applications of five-alpha reductase inhibitors.', '5α-Reductase Inhibitors and Risk of Kidney and Bladder Cancers in Men with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: A Population-Based Cohort Study.', 'Genetically supported causality between benign prostate hyperplasia and urinary bladder neoplasms: A mendelian randomization study.', 'Impact of Androgen Suppression Therapy on the Risk and Prognosis of Bladder Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

However, 33% will become metastatic within 2 years. The goal of treatment in patients with nonmetastatic CRPC (nmCRPC), therefore, is to delay symptomatic metastases without undue toxicity. With novel antiandrogen treatments of different strengths and limitations available, physician preferences for nmCRPC treatment in Japan should be understood.  Methods:   A discrete choice experiment was conducted. Physicians chose between two hypothetical treatments in nmCRPC defined by six attributes: risk of fatigue, falls or fracture, cognitive impairment, hypertension, rashes as side effects of treatment, and extension of time until cancer-related pain occurs. Relative preference weights and relative importance were estimated by hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression. Physicians were also asked to make treatment decisions based on four hypothetical patient profiles to understand the most important factors driving decision making.  Results:   A total of 151 physicians completed the survey. Extension of time until cancer-related pain occurs was the most important attribute (relative importance, 32.3%; CI, 31.3% to 33.3%). Based on summed preference weights across all attributes, preferences for hypothetical treatment profiles I, II, and III were compared. A hypothetical treatment profile with better safety though shorter extension time was preferred (I: mean [standard deviation] = 1.7 [1.6 to 2.1]) over treatment profiles with lower safety but longer extension time (II: -2.7 [-2.8 to -2.6] and III: -0.2 [-0.3 to -0.1]). Treatment characteristics were more important factors for physicians' decision making than patient characteristics in prescribing treatment.  Conclusion:   Physicians preferred a treatment with better safety profile, and treatment characteristics were the most important factors for decision making. This might have implications in physicians' decision making for nmCRPC treatment in the future in Japan.""","""['Kazuhiro Suzuki', 'Vince Grillo', 'Yirong Chen', 'Shikha Singh', 'Dianne Athene Ledesma']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""JCO Glob Oncol""","""['Unmet needs in non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer from the Japanese patient perspective: a discrete choice experiment.', 'Patient preferences for treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer in Japan: a discrete-choice experiment.', 'Physician preferences for non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treatment.', 'Conceptual assessment of HRQOL among Japanese non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) patients.', 'Management of Nonmetastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Recent Advances and Future Direction.', 'Unmet needs in non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer from the Japanese patient perspective: a discrete choice experiment.']"""

Bipolar androgen therapy (BAT), defined as rapid cycling between high and low serum testosterone, disrupts this adaptive regulation in castration-resistant PCa (CRPC).  Methods:   The TRANSFORMER (Testosterone Revival Abolishes Negative Symptoms, Fosters Objective Response and Modulates Enzalutamide Resistance) study is a randomized study comparing monthly BAT (n = 94) with enzalutamide (n = 101). The primary end point was clinical or radiographic progression-free survival (PFS); crossover was permitted at progression. Secondary end points included overall survival (OS), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and objective response rates, PFS from randomization through crossover (PFS2), safety, and quality of life (QoL).  Results:   The PFS was 5.7 months for both arms (hazard ratio [HR], 1.14; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.55; P = .42). For BAT, 50% decline in PSA (PSA50) was 28.2% of patients versus 25.3% for enzalutamide. At crossover, PSA50 response occurred in 77.8% of patients crossing to enzalutamide and 23.4% to BAT. The PSA-PFS for enzalutamide increased from 3.8 months after abiraterone to 10.9 months after BAT. The PFS2 for BAT→enzalutamide was 28.2 versus 19.6 months for enzalutamide→BAT (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.88; P = .02). OS was 32.9 months for BAT versus 29.0 months for enzalutamide (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.39; P = .80). OS was 37.1 months for patients crossing from BAT to enzalutamide versus 30.2 months for the opposite sequence (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.36 to 1.28; P = .225). BAT adverse events were primarily grade 1-2. Patient-reported QoL consistently favored BAT.  Conclusion:   This randomized trial establishes meaningful clinical activity and safety of BAT and supports additional study to determine its optimal clinical integration.

Methods:   Clinical characteristics of consecutive men undergoing pre-operative mpMRI prior to RP and whole-mount axial serial step-sectioned pathology examination at two academic centers between Jun 2016 and Oct 2018 were analyzed retrospectively. Every tumor was characterized by its pathologic minimum distance to the prostatic urethral lumen (pMDUL). Only the cancer closest to the urethra represented the prostatic urethral index lesion. The radiologic minimum distance of the index lesion to the prostatic urethral lumen was measured and noted as ≤ 5 mm versus > 5 mm. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predicting values (PPV and NPV) and area under the receivers operating characteristics curve (AUC) were calculated for performance of mpMRI for predicting pMDUL ≤ 5 mm.  Results:   Of the 163 surgical specimens examined, 112 (69%) exhibited a pMDUL ≤ 5 mm. These men had significantly higher grade group (GG) and advanced pathological and clinical stage. The rates of high PI-RADS score and presence of gross extracapsular extension were also significantly greater for the group with pMDUL ≤ 5 mm. The AUC, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 0.641, 51.8, 76.5, 82.9, and 42.4%, respectively, for mpMRI to predict pMDUL < 5 mm.  Conclusions:   Nearly 70% of men undergoing RP present with tumor within 5 mm of the prostatic urethra.

Methods:   An sCT software for general pelvis anatomy (prostate, rectum, and female pelvis) has been developed by Philips Healthcare and includes continuous HUs assignment along with large FOV coverage. General pelvis sCTs were generated using a two-stack T1-weighted mDixon fast-field echo (FFE) sequence with a superior-inferior coverage of 36 cm. Seventy-seven prostate, 43 rectum, and 27 gynecological cases were scanned by three different institutions. mDixon image quality and sCTs were evaluated for soft tissue contrast by using a confidence level scale from 1 to 5 for bladder, prostate/rectum interface, mesorectum, and fiducial maker visibility. Dosimetric comparison was performed by recalculating the RT plans on the sCT after rigid registration. For 12 randomly selected cases, the mean absolute error (MAE) between sCT and CT was calculated to evaluate HU similarity, and the Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC) between the CT- and sCT-generated digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) were obtained for quantitative comparison. To examine geometric accuracy of sCT as a reference for cone beam CT (CBCT), the difference between bone-based alignment of CBCT to CT and CBCT to sCT was obtained for 19 online-acquired CBCTs from three patients.  Results:   Two-stack mDixon scans with large FOV did not show any image inhomogeneity or fat-water swap artifact. Fiducials, Foley catheter, and even rectal spacer were visible as dark signal on the sCT. Average visibility confidence level (average ± standard deviation) on the sCT was 5.0 ± 0.0, 4.6 ± 0.5, 3.8 ± 0.4, and 4.0 ± 1.1 for bladder, prostate/rectum interface, mesorectum and fiducial markers.

Patients and methods:   Cases of T1 to 4 N0 M0 prostate DA diagnosed between 2004 and 2013 were extracted from SEER. The association between categorical variables and radiation therapy was assessed for statistical significance using the χ2 test or Fisher exact test. Difference in continuous variables across the RT groups was assessed for statistical significance using the 2-sample t test or non-parametric test. The distribution of overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) between the RT groups was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log rank test and after propensity matching. The association between hazards of death (HR) and covariates was examined using Cox proportional hazards model. A 2-sided P-value of .05 was used to determine statistical significance.  Results:   A total of 205 patients met inclusion criteria. On univariate analysis, RT was associated with significant improvement in OS and DSS.

Data therefore must be retrieved from other cohorts, with longer follow-up. We sourced data from a population-based prospective cohort including 11,343 men aged over 45 years, enrolled in the 1970s. The results showed that childless men have higher risk for prostate cancer related mortality (HR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.09-2.03, p = 0.01) compared to men with children, in particular when only married men, who most probably are involuntary childless, were considered (HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.13 - 2.10, p = 0.006). However, the prostate cancer incidence did not differ (HR = 1.04, 95% CI: 0.88-1.24).

We hypothesized that the BS extract containing 30% (AKBA) with enzalutamide acted synergistically in the early phase of cancer, especially in LNCaP cells, by inhibiting androgen receptor (AR) and by reducing cell proliferation, and further, that the extract would be superior to the action of the active ingredient AKBA when used alone or in combination with enzalutamide. To test our hypothesis, we treated LNCaP cells with BS extract or AKBA and enzalutamide both individually and in combination to analyze cell viability under different levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The inhibition of androgen receptor (AR) followed by the expression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and the efflux mechanism of the cells were analyzed to determine the effect of the combination on the cellular mechanism. Cells derived from prostate cancer patients were also tested with the combination. Only 6 µM enzalutamide along with BS in the range of 4.1 µg/ml to 16.4 µg/ml gave the best synergistic results with nearly 50% cell killing even though standard enzalutamide doses were as high as 48 µM. Cell killing was most effective at intermediate DHT concentrations of approximately 1 nM, which corresponds to normal physiological serum levels of DHT. The Pgp expression level and the androgen receptor expression levels were reduced under the combination treatment; the former helping to minimize drug efflux and the latter by reducing the sensitivity to hormonal changes. Furthermore, the combination reduced the PSA level secreted by the cells. In contrast, AKBA could not achieve the needed synergism for adequate cell killing at equivalent concentrations. The combination of enzalutamide and BS extract containing 30% AKBA because of their synergistic interaction is an attractive therapeutic option for treating early stage (hormone-dependent) prostate cancer and is superior to the use of AKBA alone.""","""['Prathesha Pillai', 'Ginil Kumar Pooleri', 'Shantikumar V Nair']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Integr Cancer Ther""","""['Corrigendum to Role of Testosterone Levels on the Combinatorial Effect of Boswellia serrata Extract and Enzalutamide on Androgen Dependent LNCaP Cells and in Patient Derived Cells.', 'The major Boswellia serrata active 3-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid strengthens interleukin-1α upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 via JNK MAP kinase activation.', 'Acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid, a constituent of a herbal medicine from Boswellia serrata resin, attenuates experimental ileitis.', 'Combination therapy with androgen receptor N-terminal domain antagonist EPI-7170 and enzalutamide yields synergistic activity in AR-V7-positive prostate cancer.', 'Darolutamide as a Second-Generation Androgen Receptor Inhibitor in the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Boswellia serrata: an overall assessment of in vitro, preclinical, pharmacokinetic and clinical data.']"""

Ketamine is a fast-acting N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been emerging as an effective medication for pain alleviation. While protocols have been established for the use of Low-Dose Ketamine (LDK) for post-operative pain, there is growing evidence for using LDK as a clinical alternative to opioids in a palliative care setting. This case study involves monitoring the efficacy of LDK treatment in combination with opioid analgesics in a cancer patient in a hospital setting. This is a very selected case of a patient with Metastatic Prostate Cancer (Gleason 9 Adenocarcinoma) where LDK was shown to be efficacious at reducing pain when opioids and standard pain medications were not satisfactory. While the study involved using a relatively novel pharmacological protocol and close patient monitoring, the patient reported a sustained reduction in pain level based on the Numerical Rating Scale for months after the termination of LDK infusions. Moreover, the treatment also resulted in a reduction of total opioid usage after the addition of LDK. Although additional research is needed to ascertain optimal dosing schedules and route of Ketamine, given these promising findings, Ketamine may be a useful option for improving the treatment of refractory pain in patients with cancer and a good tool in palliative medicine for treating neoplastic pain.""","""['Sapan Patel', 'Vivas Tatachar', 'Aditya Bikram Singh', 'Julia Galea', 'Emma Fattakhov', 'Gurjinder Kaur']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Ann Palliat Med""","""['Low dose ketamine use in the emergency department, a new direction in pain management.', 'A Case Report of Subanesthetic Ketamine Bolus and Infusion for Opioid Refractory Cancer Pain.', 'Case report: efficacy and tolerability of ketamine in opioid-refractory cancer pain.', 'Low-dose ketamine analgesia: patient and physician experience in the ED.', 'Palliative Treatment of Cancer-Related Pain Internet.']"""

Methods:   The primary outcome was to compare complications after P-Bx between patients of two cohorts: 2010-2014 and 2016-2019. Primary outcomes included symptoms of lower and severe/systemic urinary tract infection (LUTIS and SUTIS, respectively), and positive urine culture. Readmission to hospital after P-Bx, need for additional antimicrobial therapy, consumption of different antimicrobial agents for prophylaxis and therapy were evaluated.

The SIGLEC12 gene, which encodes the Siglec-XII protein expressed on epithelial cells, has several uniquely human features: a fixed homozygous missense mutation inactivating its natural ligand recognition property; a polymorphic frameshift mutation eliminating full-length protein expression in ~60%-70% of worldwide human populations; and, genomic features suggesting a negative selective sweep favoring the pseudogene state. Despite the loss of canonical sialic acid binding, Siglec-XII still recruits Shp2 and accelerates tumor growth in a mouse model. We hypothesized that dysfunctional Siglec-XII facilitates human carcinoma progression, correlating with known tumorigenic signatures of Shp2-dependent cancers. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect Siglec-XII expression on tissue microarrays. PC-3 prostate cancer cells were transfected with Siglec-XII and transcription of genes enriched with Siglec-XII was determined. Genomic SIGLEC12 status was determined for four different cancer cohorts. Finally, a dot blot analysis of human urinary epithelial cells was established to determine the Siglec-XII expressors versus non-expressors. Forced expression in a SIGLEC12 null carcinoma cell line enriched transcription of genes associated with cancer progression. While Siglec-XII was detected as expected in ~30%-40% of normal epithelia, ~80% of advanced carcinomas showed strong expression. Notably, >80% of late-stage colorectal cancers had a functional SIGLEC12 allele, correlating with overall increased mortality. Thus, advanced carcinomas are much more likely to occur in individuals whose genomes have an intact SIGLEC12 gene, likely because the encoded Siglec-XII protein recruits Shp2-related oncogenic pathways.

NDV preferentially replicates in tumor cells due to signaling defects in apoptotic and antiviral pathways acquired during the transformation process and is a potent immunostimulatory agent. However, when used as a monotherapy NDV lacks the ability to consistently generate durable remissions. Here we investigate the use of viral sensitizer-mediated combination therapy to enhance the anti-neoplastic efficacy of NDV. Intratumoral injection of vanadyl sulfate, a pan-inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatases, in combination with NDV significantly increased the number and activation status of natural killer (NK) cells in the tumor microenvironment, concomitant with increased expression of interferon-β, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, leading to rapid tumor regression and long-term cures in mice bearing syngeneic B16-F10 melanomas. The anti-tumor efficacy of this combination therapy was abrogated when NK cells were depleted and when interferon-β expression was transiently suppressed. Tumor-specific CD8+ T cell responses were not detected, nor were mice whose tumors regressed protected from re-challenge. This suggested efficacy of the combination therapy predominantly relied on the innate immune system. Importantly, efficacy was not limited to melanoma; it was also demonstrated in a murine prostate cancer model. Taken together, these results suggest that combining NDV with vanadyl sulfate potentiates an innate immune response that can potentiate rapid clearance of tumors, with type I interferon signaling and NK cells being important mechanisms of action.""","""['Thomas M McAusland', 'Jacob P van Vloten', 'Lisa A Santry', 'Matthew M Guilleman', 'Amira D Rghei', 'Edgar M Ferreira', 'Joelle C Ingrao', 'Rozanne Arulanandam', 'Pierre P Major', 'Leonardo Susta', 'Khalil Karimi', 'Jean-Simon Diallo', 'Byram W Bridle', 'Sarah K Wootton']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Mol Ther Oncolytics""","""['Oncolytic Newcastle disease virus expressing a checkpoint inhibitor as a radioenhancing agent for murine melanoma.', 'Newcastle Disease Virus at the Forefront of Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'Genetically engineered Newcastle disease virus expressing interleukin 2 is a potential drug candidate for cancer immunotherapy.', 'Genetic Modification of Oncolytic Newcastle Disease Virus for Cancer Therapy.', 'Oncolytic Newcastle disease virus as a prospective anti-cancer therapy.

This energy demand is, among others, met by mitochondrial ATP production. Since the second messenger Ca2+ maintains the activity of Krebs cycle dehydrogenases that fuel mitochondrial respiration, proper mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is crucial for a cancer cell survival. However, a mitochondrial Ca2+ overload induces mitochondrial dysfunction and, ultimately, apoptotic cell death. Because of the vital importance of balancing mitochondrial Ca2+ levels, a highly sophisticated machinery of multiple proteins manages mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis. Notably, mitochondria sequester Ca2+ preferentially at the interaction sites between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the largest internal Ca2+ store, thus, pointing to mitochondrial-associated membranes (MAMs) as crucial hubs between cancer prosperity and cell death. To investigate potential regulatory mechanisms of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake routes in cancer cells, we modulated mitochondria-ER tethering and the expression of UCP2 and analyzed mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis under the various conditions. Hence, the expression of contributors to mitochondrial Ca2+ regulation machinery was quantified by qRT-PCR. We further used data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to correlate these in vitro findings with expression patterns in human breast invasive cancer and human prostate adenocarcinoma. ER-mitochondrial linkage was found to support a mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake route dependent on uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) in cancer cells. Notably, combined overexpression of Rab32, a protein kinase A-anchoring protein fostering the ER-mitochondrial tethering, and UCP2 caused a significant drop in cancer cells' viability. Artificially enhanced ER-mitochondrial tethering further initiated a sudden decline in the expression of UCP2, probably as an adaptive response to avoid mitochondrial Ca2+ overload. Besides, TCGA analysis revealed an inverse expression correlation between proteins stabilizing mitochondrial-ER linkage and UCP2 in tissues of human breast invasive cancer and prostate adenocarcinoma. Based on these results, we assume that cancer cells successfully manage mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake to stimulate Ca2+-dependent mitochondrial metabolism while avoiding Ca2+-triggered cell death by fine-tuning ER-mitochondrial tethering and the expression of UCP2 in an inversed manner. Disruption of this equilibrium yields cancer cell death and may serve as a treatment strategy to specifically kill cancer cells.""","""['Corina T Madreiter-Sokolowski', 'Benjamin Gottschalk', 'Armin A Sokolowski', 'Roland Malli', 'Wolfgang F Graier']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Front Cell Dev Biol""","""['UCP2 and PRMT1 are key prognostic markers for lung carcinoma patients.', 'Enhanced inter-compartmental Ca2+ flux modulates mitochondrial metabolism and apoptotic threshold during aging.', 'T3-induced enhancement of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake as a boost for mitochondrial metabolism.', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum-Mitochondria Communication Through Ca2+ Signaling: The Importance of Mitochondria-Associated Membranes (MAMs).', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum-Mitochondrial Ca2+ Fluxes Underlying Cancer Cell Survival.', 'Ultrastructural analysis of prostate cancer tissue provides insights into androgen-dependent adaptations to membrane contact site establishment.', 'Uncovering Actions of Type 3 Deiodinase in the Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Fatty Liver Disease (MAFLD).', 'Key genes expressed in mitochondria‑endoplasmic reticulum contact sites in cancer (Review).', 'UCP2 as a Cancer Target through Energy Metabolism and Oxidative Stress Control.', 'MCU controls melanoma progression through a redox-controlled phenotype switch.']"""

Docetaxel (DTX) is the gold standard for chemotherapy of prostate cancer, but its side effects decrease the life quality of patients. Therefore, it is urgent to develop combination therapy to increase its anti-tumor effect. Methods: Oncolytic adenovirus targeting SATB1 was constructed and named ZD55-SATB1. Human prostatic cancer cells DU145 and PC-3 and human prostatic stromal cells WPMY-1 were treated with ZD55-SATB1 or/and DTX. In vitro cell proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis were detected. In addition, PC-3 cells were injected subcutaneously into nude mice, which were treated with ZD55-SATB1 or/and DTX. Tumor growth was monitored in vivo. Results: ZD55-SATB1 combined with DTX inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of DU145 and PC-3 cells, while promoted apoptosis of DU145 and PC-3 cells more efficiently than monotherapy. ZD55-SATB1 had no cytotoxicity on WPMY-1 cells. In animal models, the combined treatment of ZD55-SATB1+DTX and endocrine therapy effectively inhibited the growth of xenograft tumor, accompanied by increased expression of caspase-3 and caspase-8, and decrease expression of Bcl-2 and angiogenesis marker CD31 compared to other treatment groups.

However, the effect of NLRP3 complex formation on tumor progression remains controversial. Therefore, we sought to determine the effect of NLRP3 modulation on the growth of the different types of cancer cells, derived from lung, breast, and prostate cancers as well as neuroblastoma and glioblastoma in-vitro.  Method:   The effect of Caspase 1 inhibitor (VX765) and combination of LPS/Nigericin on NLRP3 inflammasome activity was analyzed in A549 (lung cancer), MCF-7 (breast cancer), PC3 (prostate cancer), SH-SY5Y (neuroblastoma), and U138MG (glioblastoma) cells. Human fibroblasts were used as control cells. The effect of VX765 and LPS/Nigericin on NLRP3 expression was analyzed using western blot, while IL-1β and IL-18 secretion was detected by ELISA. Tumor cell viability and progression were determined using Annexin V, cell proliferation assay, LDH assay, sphere formation assay, transmission electron microscopy, and a multiplex cytokine assay. Also, angiogenesis was investigated by a tube formation assay. VEGF and MMPs secretion were detected by ELISA and a multiplex assay, respectively. Statistical analysis was done using one-way ANOVA with Tukey's analyses and Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance.  Results:   LPS/Nigericin increased NRLP3 protein expression as well as IL-1β and IL-18 secretion in PC3 and U138MG cells compared to A549, MCF7, SH-SY5Y cells, and fibroblasts. In contrast, MIF expression was commonly found upregulated in A549, PC3, SH-SY5Y, and U138MG cells and fibroblasts after Nigericin treatment. Nigericin and a combination of LPS/Nigericin decreased the cell viability and proliferation. Also, LPS/Nigericin significantly increased tumorsphere size in PC3 and U138MG cells. In contrast, the sphere size was reduced in MCF7 and SH-SY5Y cells treated with LPS/Nigericin, while no effect was detected in A549 cells. VX765 increased secretion of CCL24 in A549, MCF7, PC3, and fibroblasts as well as CCL11 and CCL26 in SH-SY5Y cells. Also, VX765 significantly increased the production of VEGF and MMPs and stimulated angiogenesis in all tumor cell lines.

However, because of the weak immunogenicity of peptides in subunit vaccines, it is difficult to trigger an effective cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response, which is critical for cancer therapy. A requirement for the activation of CTL cells by exogenous antigens is the stimulation of antigen presenting cells (APC) with the help of adjuvants and cross-presentation to T lymphocytes. Standard nonconjugated adjuvant-peptide mixtures do not ensure co-targeting of the antigen and the adjuvant to the same APC, which limits the effects of adjuvants. In this study, a fusion protein consisting of murine granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (mGM-CSF) fused with CTA2 (A2 subunit of cholera toxin) was generated and assembled with CTB-PSMA624-632 (prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) peptide 624-632 fused to CTB) to obtain a cholera toxin-like protein. The chimeric protein retained the biological activity of mGM-CSF and had stronger GM1 binding activity than (CTB-PSMA624-632)5. C57BL/6J mice immunized with the CT-like chimeric protein exhibited delayed tumor growth following challenge with human PSMA-EGFP-expressing RM-1 cells. Experiment results showed that the CT-like chimeric protein could induce the maturation of DC cells and improve CTL responses. Overall, these results indicate that the nasal administration of a CT-like chimeric protein vaccine results in the development of effective immunity against prostate tumor cells and might be useful for future clinical anti-tumoral applications.""","""['Danmin Lin', 'Huafeng He', 'Jiajie Sun', 'Xianying He', 'Wei Long', 'Xiping Cui', 'Yunxiao Sun', 'Suqing Zhao', 'Xi Zheng', 'Zheng Zeng', 'Kun Zhang', 'Huaqian Wang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Vaccine""","""['Screening of HLA-A24-restricted epitope peptides from prostate-specific membrane antigen that induce specific antitumor cytotoxic T lymphocytes.', 'Intranasal immunization with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitope peptide and mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin: selective augmentation of peptide-presenting dendritic cells in nasal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue.', 'DNA fusion gene vaccines induce cytotoxic T-cell attack on naturally processed peptides of human prostate-specific membrane antigen.', 'Mucosal adjuvants and anti-infection and anti-immunopathology vaccines based on cholera toxin, cholera toxin B subunit and CpG DNA.', 'Strategies for the induction of immune responses at mucosal surfaces making use of cholera toxin B subunit as immunogen, carrier, and adjuvant.', 'AB Toxins as High-Affinity Ligands for Cell Targeting in Cancer Therapy.']"""

Method:   A retrospective observational design was employed to investigate care costs of cases recorded in the Registry of the Basque Country between 2010 and 2015. Data gathered included TNM stage and demographic, clinical and resource use variables. Total costs per patient with stage IV disease were calculated by combining generalized linear models with parametric survival analysis. Unit costs were obtained from the analytical accounting system of the Basque Health Service.  Results:   The sample comprised 23,782 cancer cases (7801 colorectal, 5530 breast, 4802 prostate and 5649 lung cancer). The mean 3-year costs per patient with stage I to III disease were €11,323, €13,727, €8,651 and €12,023 for colorectal, breast, prostate and lung cancer, respectively. The most important cost components were surgery and chemotherapy. Total survival-adjusted costs until death for patients with stage IV disease (€27,568, €26,296, €16,151 and €15,931 for breast, colorectal, lung and prostate cancer, respectively) were higher than the 3-year costs for those with earlier-stage disease.  Conclusions:   This study quantitatively shows the pattern of changes in the economic burden of cancer throughout its natural history and the great magnitude of this burden for the health system.

Methods and materials:   Owing to simultaneous optimization of energy dependent intensity maps and corresponding arc locations, the proposed model poses nonlinearity. Unique relaxation constraints based on McCormick approximations were introduced for linearization. Energy dependent intensity maps were then decomposed to generate apertures. Feasibility of the proposed framework was tested on a sample of ten prostate cancer cases with lateral separation ranging from 34 cm (case no.1) to 52 cm (case no.6). The SAMP plans were compared against single energy (6MV) VMAT (SE) plans through dose volume histograms (DVHs) and radiobiological parameters including normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) and equivalent uniform dose (EUD).  Results:   The contribution of higher energy photon beam optimized by the algorithm demonstrated an increase for cases with a lateral separation >40 cm. SAMP-VMAT notably improved bladder and rectum sparing in large size cases. Compared to single energy, SAMP-VMAT plans reduced bladder and rectum NTCP in cases with large lateral separation. With the exception of one case, SAMP-VMAT either improved or maintained femoral heads compared to SE-VMAT. SAMP-VMAT reduced the nontarget tissue integral dose in all ten cases.  Conclusions:   A single-arc VMAT optimization framework comprising mixed photon energy partial arcs was presented. Overall results underline the feasibility and potential of the proposed approach for improving OAR sparing in large size patients without compromising the target homogeneity and coverage.""","""['Shadab Momin', 'James L Gräfe', 'Konstantinos Georgiou', 'Rao F Khan']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Phys Med""","""['Simultaneous optimization of mixed photon energy beams in volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Dosimetric and radiobiological comparison of prostate VMAT plans optimized using the photon and progressive resolution algorithm.', 'Evaluation of a mixed beam therapy for postmastectomy breast cancer patients: Bolus electron conformal therapy combined with intensity modulated photon radiotherapy and volumetric modulated photon arc therapy.', 'Treatment planning comparison of IMPT, VMAT and 4π radiotherapy for prostate cases.', 'Prostate volumetric-modulated arc therapy: dosimetry and radiobiological model variation between the single-arc and double-arc technique.', 'Does radiation therapy need more than two photon energies from Linac?']"""

The relative effect of cribriform presence versus percentage G4 within grade group (GG)2 or 3 was uncertain. 194 men's biopsies with GG2 with or without cribriform (excluding glomeruloid from cribriform) and GG3 without cribriform (controls) from 4 years were reviewed. 173 cases had follow-up including 147 GG2 (15/147 or 10% had cribriform) and 26 GG3. Effects of total tumor specimen involvement, %Gleason 4, and cribriform were stratified into prostatectomy (n = 90), radiotherapy (n = 61), and watching waiting (n = 22) groups. Median follow-up duration was 3.32 years (range 1.90-6.18). Biochemical failures in the above 3 cohorts numbered 9 (9/90; 10%), 5 (5/61; 8%), and 13 (13/22; 59%) respectively. In all groups, (GG2+ GG3, n = 173), the HR for C pattern was 1.64. In GG2, cribriform presence (considering glomeruloid as non-cribriform) conferred a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.51 (p = 0.48). It was 1.38, excluding glomeruloid. In watchful waiting cohort only, presence of C conferred a HR of 2.62 (p = 0.086). All remaining comparisons including percent G4, remained not significant. Thus, only in WW group did cribriform pattern presence approach significance. Detection of differences otherwise was not feasible, probably because: 1) biochemical failure is too rare in GG2 cancer; 2) cribriform frequency was only 10% in GG2 (in current study), less than in higher-grade cancer. 3) Use of biopsy tissue is subject to sampling variation which may undersample cribriform pattern, though biopsy forms the basis of treatment decisions.""","""['Rebecca C Czaja', 'Sergey Tarima', 'Ruizhe Wu', 'Watchareepohn Palagnmonthip', 'Kenneth A Iczkowski']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Ann Diagn Pathol""","""['Prevalence of adverse pathology features in grade group 2 prostatectomy specimens with syn- or metachronous metastatic disease.', 'Diagnostic Accuracy of Prostate Biopsy for Detecting Cribriform Gleason Pattern 4 Carcinoma and Intraductal Carcinoma in Paired Radical Prostatectomy Specimens: Implications for Active Surveillance.', 'Metastatic potential to regional lymph nodes with Gleason score ≤7, including tertiary pattern 5, at radical prostatectomy.', 'Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'Prostate cancer with cribriform morphology: diagnosis, aggressiveness, molecular pathology and possible relationships with intraductal carcinoma.', 'Oncological outcomes of cribriform histology pattern in prostate cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Objective:   To test the effect of race/ethnicity (Caucasian, African American, Hispanic/Latino, and Asian) on LE predictions from Social Security Administration (SSA) life tables in male and female T1aN0M0 RCC patients.  Design, setting, and participants:   We relied on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database.  Intervention:   Radical nephrectomy (RN) and partial nephrectomy (PN).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Five-year and 10-yr observed overall survival (OS) of pT1aN0M0 RCC patients treated between 2004 and 2006 were compared with the LE predicted from SSA life tables.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) plus ciprofloxacin as prophylaxis in post-docetaxel patients with mCRPC treated with cabazitaxel and at high risk for neutropenia.  Patients and methods:   This was a phase IV, multicenter, open-label, single-arm interventional study with men aged ≥ 65 years (or < 65 years and ≥ 25% irradiated bone marrow), presenting with mCRPC after docetaxel failure, performance status ≤ 1, and life expectancy > 12 weeks. Cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 and prednisone were given on day 1, every 21 days. G-CSF was administered on days 2 to 8 of each cycle or until an absolute neutrophil count > 2000/mm3, and ciprofloxacin 1000 mg was given orally on days 5 to 12. The rate of neutropenia grade ≥ 3 during the first cycle (primary endpoint), and frequency of neutropenia grade ≥ 3, febrile neutropenia, diarrhea grade ≥ 3, prostate-specific antigen response, and quality of life during treatment (secondary end points) were estimated.  Results:   We included 46 patients. The mean number of cabazitaxel cycles was 9.5. During the first cycle, 40.0% of patients had neutropenia grade ≥ 3, and 42.2% had at least 1 episode of neutropenia during treatment. Febrile neutropenia and diarrhea grade ≥ 3 occurred in 1 patient each. Twenty-nine (64.4%) patients achieved prostate-specific antigen response, and 77.2% improved quality of life scores in at least 1 visit.  Conclusions:   Prophylactic G-CSF was effective in preventing neutropenia grade ≥ 3 and other hematologic complications during treatment with cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 in post-docetaxel patients with mCRPC at high risk for neutropenia. The role of prophyclatic ciprofloxacin to prevent febrile neutropenia in this setting is still unclear and needs to be further evaluated.""","""['Fernando C Maluf', 'Fabrício A M de Oliveira', 'Pedro E R Liedke', 'Leandro Brust', 'Cristina G Inocêncio', 'Fernando S M Monteiro', 'Oren Smaletz', 'Daniel I Cubero']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Severe neutropenia during cabazitaxel treatment is associated with survival benefit in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC): A post-hoc analysis of the TROPIC phase III trial.', 'Custirsen (OGX-011) combined with cabazitaxel and prednisone versus cabazitaxel and prednisone alone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel (AFFINITY): a randomised, open-label, international, phase 3 trial.', 'Safety of cabazitaxel in senior adults with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: results of the European compassionate-use programme.', 'Cabazitaxel schedules in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a review.', 'Cabazitaxel: a novel second-line treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

However, both are vague as to specific type of cross-sectional imaging (CT vs. MRI) and extent (abdominal vs. pelvis), thereby raising concern for overlapping imaging. We investigated if current AUA and NCCN CaP staging guidelines can become more specific yet maintain sufficient staging.  Methods:   We identified 493 patients diagnosed with CaP between 2011 and 2017 and focused analysis on those with AUA and NCCN Intermediate risk (IR) and High risk (HR) groups. Type of staging imaging was recorded and frequency of overlapping (CT + MRI) and abdominal imaging determined. Significance of radiologist findings, for both overlapping and abdominal imaging, were classified as nonurologic, nonsignificant urologic, and CaP significant.  Results:   Among IR and HR AUA and NCCN risk groups, 82 (35.7%) and 95 (37.3%) patients, respectively, experienced overlapping imaging, of which only 7 patients in AUA and 9 patients in NCCN risk groups had an abnormal CT with normal MRI. However, only 3 of these CTs had CaP significant findings, of which 2 identified bone metastases, which were subsequently detected on bone scan. In regard to the extent of imaging, a total of 157 (68.2%) AUA and 178 (69.8%) NCCN IR and HR patients received abdominal scans, of which only 46 (20.0%) and 49 (19.2%) were abnormal among AUA and NCCN risk groups, respectively. Among these abnormal abdominal scans, only 10 showed CaP significant findings, of which half were suspected bone metastases, and confirmed on recommended bone scan.  Conclusions:   Due to nonspecific staging guidelines in IR and HR CaP regarding type and extent of cross-sectional imaging, patients are frequently receiving imaging of overlapping locations. Based on low occurrences of unique CaP significant findings on CT and abdominal imaging, our exploratory analysis suggests that narrowing cross-sectional imaging recommendations to pelvic MRI may reduce imaging overlap while maintaining sufficient staging.""","""['R Grant Owens', 'Justin Loloi', 'Erik B Lehman', 'Matthew G Kaag', 'Jay D Raman', 'Suzanne B Merrill']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Stratifying patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer: Validation of a new model based on MRI parameters and targeted biopsy and comparison with NCCN and AUA subclassifications.', 'Calibrated Regression Models Based on the Risk of Clinical Nodal Metastasis Should be Used as Decision Aids for Prostate Cancer Staging to Reduce Unnecessary Imaging.', 'Serum prostate-specific antigen as a predictor of radiographic staging studies in newly diagnosed prostate cancer.', 'Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeted Biopsy in Patients with a Prior Negative Biopsy: A Consensus Statement by AUA and SAR.', 'Imaging and Management of Prostate Cancer.']"""

A challenge in the treatment of prostate cancer is to avoid undertreatment of patients at high risk of progression following curative treatment. These men can benefit from early salvage treatment. An explorative cohort consisting of tissue from 16 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy, and were either alive or had died from prostate cancer within 10 years postsurgery, was analyzed by mass spectrometry analysis. Following proteomic and bioinformatic analyses, major vault protein (MVP) was identified as a putative prognostic biomarker. A publicly available tissue proteomics dataset and a retrospective cohort of 368 prostate cancer patients were used for validation. The prognostic value of the MVP was verified by scoring immunohistochemical staining of a tissue microarray. High level of MVP was associated with more than 4-fold higher risk for death from prostate cancer (hazard ratio = 4.41, 95% confidence interval: 1.45-13.38; P = 0.009) in a Cox proportional hazard models, adjusted for Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessments Post-surgical (CAPRA-S) score and perineural invasion. Decision curve analyses suggested an improved standardized net benefit, ranging from 0.06 to 0.18, of adding MVP onto CAPRA-S score. This observation was confirmed by receiver operator characteristics curve analyses for the CAPRA-S score versus CAPRA-S and MVP score (area under the curve: 0.58 versus 0.73).

Methods:   From a radical prostatectomy (RP) cohort, we included patients with pre-biopsy positive MRI and HG [defined by Grade Group (GG) ≥ 3] PCa on MRI-TB. All patients also underwent concomitant systematic biopsy (SB). The main endpoints were the rates of downgrading to GG2, overall downgrading, favorable disease (pT2 and GG2) on RP specimens, and biochemical recurrence-free-survival (RFS). We studied the correlations between HG on concomitant SB, final pathological outcomes and biochemical RFS curves.  Results:   Overall downgrading, downgrading to GG2 disease and favorable disease were noted in 36.2%, 24.1%, and 15.4% respectively. HG on concomitant SB was correlated with pT3-4 disease (p < 0.001), pN1 disease (p < 0.001), positive surgical margins (p = 0.043), PSA recurrence (p = 0.003). In multivariable analysis, the presence of GG4-5 on TB (p = 0.013; OR 0.263) and the presence of HG on concomitant SB (p = 0.010; OR 0.269) were negatively and independently correlated with the risk of downgrading to GG2. The presence of HG on concomitant SB independently predicted RFS with a hazard ratio of 2.173 (p = 0.049; 95% CI 1.005-4.697).  Conclusions:   Our data shows that a limited HG restricted to TB can often be associated with a favorable grade in almost a quarter of the cases and downgraded in almost half of the cases.

It is important to predict the prostate's susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients and the disease outcome by assessing TMPRSS2 expression in cancer tissues. In this study, we conducted the expression profiles of the TMPRSS2 gene for COVID-19 in different normal tissues and PRAD (prostate adenocarcinoma) tumour tissues. TMPRSS2 is highly expressed in normal tissues including the small intestine, prostate, pancreas, salivary gland, colon, stomach, seminal vesicle and lung, and is increased in PRAD tissues, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 might attack not only the lungs and other normal organs, but also in PRAD cancer tissues. Hypomethylation of TMPRSS2 promoter may not be the mechanism for TMPRSS2 overexpression in PRAD tissues and PRAD pathogenesis. TMPRSS2 expresses eleven isoforms in PRAD tissues, with the TMPRSS2-001 isoform expressed highest and followed by TMPRSS2-201. Further isoform structures prediction showed that these two highly expressed isoforms have both SRCR_2 and Trypsin (Tryp_SPc) domains, which may be essential for TMPRSS2 functional roles for tumorigenesis and entry for SARS-CoV-2 in PRAD patients. Analyses of functional annotation and enrichment in TMPRSS2 showed that TMPRSS2 is mostly enriched in regulation of viral entry into host cells, protein processing and serine-type peptidase activity. TMPRSS2 is also associated with prostate gland cancer cell expression, different complex(es) formation, human influenza and carcinoma, pathways in prostate cancer, influenza A, and transcriptional misregulation in cancer. Altogether, even though high expression of TMPRSS2 may not be favourable for PRAD patient's survival, increased expression in these patients should play roles in susceptibility of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinical severity for COVID-19, highlighting the value of protective actions of PRAD cases by targeting or androgen-mediated therapeutic strategies in the COVID-19 pandemic.""","""['Jingliang Cheng', 'Ju Zhou', 'Shangyi Fu', 'Jiewen Fu', 'Baixu Zhou', 'Hanchun Chen', 'Junjiang Fu', 'Chunli Wei']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Cell Mol Med""","""['Impact of TMPRSS2 Expression, Mutation Prognostics, and Small Molecule (CD, AD, TQ, and TQFL12) Inhibition on Pan-Cancer Tumors and Susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.', 'Covid-19 pathogenesis in prostatic cancer and TMPRSS2-ERG regulatory genetic pathway.', 'Computational analysis of TMPRSS2 expression in normal and SARS-CoV-2-infected human tissues.', 'Comprehensive analysis of two potential novel SARS-CoV-2 entries, TMPRSS2 and IFITM3, in healthy individuals and cancer patients.', 'Gene of the month: TMPRSS2 (transmembrane serine protease 2).', 'The analysis of cathepsin L that mediates cellular SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to COVID-19 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'A review on human reproductive systems encountering with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.', 'Bioinformatics analysis based on high-throughput sequencing data to identify hub genes related to different clinical types of COVID-19.', 'Impact of BSG/CD147 gene expression on diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic strategies towards malignant cancers and possible susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.', 'Impact of TMPRSS2 Expression, Mutation Prognostics, and Small Molecule (CD, AD, TQ, and TQFL12) Inhibition on Pan-Cancer Tumors and Susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.']"""

Results:   DSF/Cu activated chloride channels and induced apoptosis in LNCaP (a type of androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells) cells. The chloride currents activated by DSF/Cu were significantly reduced after knockdown of CLC3 with siRNA. In addition, DSF/Cu-activated chloride currents were reduced to background current levels after perfusion with genistein, a highly specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Conversely, DSF/Cu failed to activate chloride currents in LNCaP cells after 30 minutes of pre-incubation with genistein. When genistein was removed, and DSF/Cu was added, the activated currents were small and unstable, and gradually decreased.

This paper presents a method and data demonstrating the ability to measure these microscopic pathologic tissue textures (histology) in the presence of subject motion in an MR scanner. This size range is vital to diagnosing a wide range of diseases.  Theory/methods:   MR micro-Texture (MRµT) resolves these textures by a combination of measuring a targeted set of k-values to characterize texture-as in diffraction analysis of materials, performing a selective internal excitation to isolate a volume of interest (VOI), applying a high k-value phase encode to the excited spins in the VOI, and acquiring each individual k-value data point in a single excitation-providing motion immunity and extended acquisition time for maximizing signal-to-noise ratio. Additional k-value measurements from the same tissue can be made to characterize the tissue texture in the VOI-there is no need for these additional measurements to be spatially coherent as there is no image to be reconstructed. This method was applied to phantoms and tissue specimens including human prostate tissue.  Results:   Data demonstrating resolution <50 µm, motion immunity, and clearly differentiating between normal and cancerous tissue textures are presented.

The unfolded protein response (UPR) can be cytoprotective but when acutely activated can lead to cell death. In this study, we sought to enhance the acute activation of the UPR using radiation and ONC201, an UPR activator. Treating PCa cells with ONC201 quickly increased the expression of all the key regulators of the UPR and reduced the oxidative phosphorylation, with cell death occurring 72 h later. We exploited this time lag to sensitize prostate cancer cells to radiation through short-term treatment with ONC201. To understand how priming occurred, we performed RNA-Seq analysis and found that ONC201 suppressed the expression of cell cycle and DNA repair factors.

Sub-group analyses focused on patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Patients performed 6 months of combined aerobic and resistance exercise on either HI or LMI during and after primary adjuvant cancer treatment. Plasma taken at baseline, immediately post-treatment and post-intervention was analyzed for levels of interleukin 1 beta (IL1B), IL6, IL8, IL10, tumor-necrosis factor alpha (TNFA) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Intention-to-treat analyses of 394 participants revealed no significant between-group differences. Regardless of exercise intensity, significant increases of IL6, IL8, IL10 and TNFA post-treatment followed by significant declines, except for IL8, until post-intervention were observed with no difference for CRP or IL1B. Subgroup analyses of 154 patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy revealed that CRP (estimated mean difference (95% CI): 0.59 (0.33; 1.06); P = 0.101) and TNFA (EMD (95% CI): 0.88 (0.77; 1); P = 0.053) increased less with HI exercise post-treatment compared to LMI.

This score determines the risk of progressive disease for men with prostate cancer. Here, we further validate the prognostic ability of the CCR score and evaluate its ability to help determine which patients may safely forgo multimodality therapy.  Patients and methods:   We evaluated the CCR and a CCR-based multimodality threshold (2.112) in a retrospective, multi-institutional cohort of men with National Comprehensive Cancer Network intermediate- or high-risk localized disease (N = 718). These men received single or multimodality therapy (androgen deprivation with radiation [RT], or surgery with adjuvant RT or hormones).  Results:   CCR score prognosticated metastasis for single-modality therapy, as a continuous variable (hazard ratio, 3.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.61-6.06) and when dichotomized at the threshold (hazard ratio, 15.90; 95% CI, 5.43-46.52). The 10-year Kaplan-Meier risk for those receiving single-modality (RT or surgical) therapy with CCR scores below and above the threshold for single-modality treatment was 4.3% (95% CI, 1.0%-17.1%) and 20.4% (95% CI, 13.2%-30.7%), respectively. Using the threshold, 27% of men with newly diagnosed high-risk and 73% with unfavorable intermediate-risk disease could avoid multimodality therapy.  Conclusions:   Patients with CCR scores below the multimodality threshold (2.112) may safely forgo multimodality therapy.

The 5 most common sites of prior cancers were prostate, female breast, bladder, lung and bronchus, and larynx. Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed that EC patients with prior prostate cancer and bladder cancer had the best overall survival (OS), while those with prior cancers of larynx and lung and bronchus had the worst OS. Fine and Gray competing risks analysis indicated that the administration of surgery was closely associated with better EC-specific survival (P < .001). In the secondary cohort, multivariate Cox analyses found that age at diagnosis, race, tumor grade, tumor extent, nodal status and metastasis stage, histology, and the administration of surgery were prognostic factors for OS and cancer-specific survival in EC patients. Besides, the existence of a prior cancer was an independent prognostic factor for cancer-specific survival.EC remains to be the most important cause of death in EC patients with a prior cancer.

LEAN is an open-label, non-interventional, multi-centre, German cohort study on leuprorelin in routine clinical practice.  Objectives:   To extend knowledge on the use, effectiveness, and tolerability of HEXAL/Sandoz leuprorelin (in this article, the term Leuprone® HEXAL® covers Leuprorelin Sandoz® as well) solid implant in patients with prostate cancer (PCa) in a real-world setting.  Methods:   959 PCa patients scheduled for androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) received leuprorelin acetate implant. Metabolism, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and testosterone data, if available, were collected at baseline and follow-up visits for ≥12 months.  Results:   Of 694 patients in the modified full analysis set, 26.4% received GnRH analogues ≤6 months before enrolment. Fifty-one percent of patients were treated for locally advanced or metastatic PCa. In 19.6% of patients, ADT was used in neoadjuvant or adjuvant settings and in 28.5% with rising PSA after definite therapy. Testosterone levels <0.5 ng/mL were achieved in >90% of patients.

Despite growing interest in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), integration in external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) treatment planning uptake varies globally. In order to understand the current international landscape of MRI in EBRT a survey has been performed in 11 countries. This work reports on differences and common themes identified.Methods. A multi-disciplinary Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine working party modified a survey previously used in the UK to understand current practice using MRI for EBRT treatment planning, investigate how MRI is currently used and managed as well as identify knowledge gaps. It was distributed electronically within 11 countries: Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, the UK and the USA.Results. The survey response rate within the USA was <1% and hence these results omitted from the analysis. In the other 10 countries the survey had a median response rate of 77% per country. Direct MRI access, defined as either having a dedicated MRI scanner for radiotherapy (RT) or access to a radiology MRI scanner, varied between countries. France, Italy and the UK reported the lowest direct MRI access rates and all other countries reported direct access in ≥82% of centres. Whilst ≥83% of centres in Denmark and Sweden reported having dedicated MRI scanners for EBRT, all other countries reported ≤29%. Anatomical sites receiving MRI for EBRT varied between countries with brain, prostate, head and neck being most common. Commissioning and QA of image registration and MRI scanners varied greatly, as did MRI sequences performed, staffing models and training given to different staff groups. The lack of financial reimbursement for MR was a consistent barrier for MRI implementation for RT for all countries and MR access was a reported important barrier for all countries except Sweden and Denmark.Conclusion. No country has a comprehensive approach for MR in EBRT adoption and financial barriers are present worldwide. Variations between countries in practice, equipment, staffing models, training, QA and MRI sequences have been identified, and are likely to be due to differences in funding as well as a lack of consensus or guidelines in the literature. Access to dedicated MR for EBRT is limited in all but Sweden and Denmark, but in all countries there are financial challenges with ongoing per patient costs. Despite these challenges, significant interest exists in increasing MR guided EBRT planning over the next 5 years.""","""['Richard Speight', 'Marcus Tyyger', 'Maria A Schmidt', 'Gary Liney', 'Robert Johnstone', 'Cynthia L Eccles', 'Michael Dubec', 'Ben George', 'Ann Henry', 'Trina Herbert', 'Tufve Nyholm', 'Faisal Mahmood', 'Juha Korhonen', 'Rick Sims', 'Rob H N Tijssen', 'Frederik Vanhoutte', 'Simone Busoni', 'Thomas Lacornerie', 'Hazel McCallum']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['IPEM Topical Report: A 2018 IPEM survey of MRI use for external beam radiotherapy treatment planning in the UK.', 'IPEM topical report: guidance on the use of MRI for external beam radiotherapy treatment planning.', 'IPEM topical report: results of a 2020 UK survey on the use of online treatment monitoring solutions for IMRT/VMAT.', 'IPEM topical report: the first UK survey of dose indices from radiotherapy treatment planning computed tomography scans for adult patients.', 'Medical physics challenges in clinical MR-guided radiotherapy.', 'ACPSEM position paper: the safety of magnetic resonance imaging linear accelerators.', 'Using a Further Planning MRI after Neoadjuvant Androgen Deprivation Therapy Significantly Reduces the Radiation Exposure of Organs at Risk in External Beam Radiotherapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'The current and future role of the MRI radiographer in radiation oncology: A collaborative, experiential reflection on the Australian rollout of dedicated MRI simulators.', 'MRI-only radiotherapy from an economic perspective: Can new techniques in prostate cancer treatment be cost saving?', 'Integrated MRI-guided radiotherapy - opportunities and challenges.']"""

The impact of cancer on clinical outcomes in this patient population is unclear, as is the performance of the HAS-BLED (Hypertension, Abnormal Renal/Liver Function, Stroke, Bleeding History or Predisposition, Labile INR, Elderly, Drugs/Alcohol) and CHA2 DS2 -VASc (Congestive Heart Failure, Hypertension, Age ≥ 75 years, Diabetes Mellitus, Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack, Vascular Disease, Age 65 to 74 Years, Sex Category) scores.  Methods:   This was an observational, retrospective cohort study including 2,435,541 adults hospitalized with AF. The authors investigated the incidence rates (IRs) of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, ischemic stroke, major bleeding, and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) according to the presence of cancer and cancer types.  Results:   Overall, 399,344 (16.4%) had cancer, with the most common cancers being metastatic, prostatic, colorectal, lung, breast, and bladder. During a mean follow-up of 2.0 years, cancer increased all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 2.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.99-2.01). The IR of ischemic stroke was higher with pancreatic cancer (2.8%/y), uterine cancer (2.6%/y), and breast cancer (2.6%/y), whereas it was lower with liver/lung cancer (1.9%/y) and leukemia/myeloma (2.0%/y), in comparison with noncancer patients (2.4%/y). Cancer increased the risk of major bleeding (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.26-1.28) and ICH (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.05-1.10). Leukemia, liver cancer, myeloma, and metastatic cancers showed the highest IRs for major bleeding/ICH. Major bleeding and ICH rates progressively increased with the HAS-BLED score, which showed generally good predictivity with C indexes > 0.70 for all cancer types. The CHA2 DS2 -VASc score's predictivity was slightly lower in AF patients with cancer.  Conclusions:   Cancer increased all-cause mortality, major bleeding, and ICH risk in AF patients. The association between cancer and ischemic stroke differed among cancer types, and in some types, the risk of bleeding seemed to exceed the thromboembolic risk.""","""['Daniele Pastori', 'Amélie Marang', 'Arnaud Bisson', 'Danilo Menichelli', 'Julien Herbert', 'Gregory Y H Lip', 'Laurent Fauchier']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['The HAS-BLED score has better prediction accuracy for major bleeding than CHADS2 or CHA2DS2-VASc scores in anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation.', 'Evaluation of risk stratification schemes for ischaemic stroke and bleeding in 182 678 patients with atrial fibrillation: the Swedish Atrial Fibrillation cohort study.', 'Association of CHA2 DS2 -VASc Score with Stroke, Thromboembolism, and Death in Hip Fracture Patients.', 'Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation Internet.', 'A tailored treatment strategy: a modern approach for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation.', 'Arterial Thromboembolism in Patients With AF and CHA2DS2-VASc Score 0-2\xa0With and Without Cancer.', 'Atrial Fibrillation Incidence Associated With Exposure to Anticancer Drugs Used as Monotherapy in Clinical Trials.', 'CHA2DS2-VASc Score in Cardio-Oncology: Sharpening the Rules.', 'Atrial fibrillation in cancer: thromboembolism and bleeding in daily practice.', 'Direct Oral Anticoagulants for Stroke Prevention in Special Populations: Beyond the Clinical Trials.']"""

Methods:   Four microarray datasets containing primary prostate cancer samples and benign prostate samples were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), then differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by R software (version 3.6.2). Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were performed to identify the function of DEGs. Using STRING and Cytoscape (version 3.7.1), we constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and identified the hub gene of prostate cancer. Clinical data on GSE70770 and TCGA was collected to show the role of hub gene in prostate cancer progression. The correlations between hub gene and clinical parameters were also indicated by cox regression analysis. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed to highlight the function of Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme complex (UBE2C) in prostate cancer.  Results:   243 upregulated genes and 298 downregulated genes that changed in at least two microarrays have been identified. GO and KEGG analysis indicated significant changes in the oxidation-reduction process, angiogenesis, TGF-beta signaling pathway. UBE2C, PDZ-binding kinase (PBK), cyclin B1 (CCNB1), Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 3 (CDKN3), topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A), Aurora kinase A (AURKA) and MKI67 were identified as the candidate hub genes, which were all correlated with prostate cancer patient' disease-free survival in TCGA. In fact, only UBE2C was highly expressed in prostate cancer when compared with benign prostate tissue in TCGA and the expression of UBE2C was also in parallel with the Gleason score of prostate cancer. Cox regression analysis has indicated UBE2C could function as the independent prognostic factor of prostate cancer. GSEA showed UBE2C had played an important role in the pathway of prostate cancer, such as NOTCH signaling pathway, WNT-β-catenin signaling pathway.  Conclusions:   UBE2C was pivotal for the progression of prostate cancer and the level of UBE2C was important to predict the prognosis of patients.""","""['Yan Wang', 'Jili Wang', 'Qiusu Tang', 'Guoping Ren']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Elevated TOP2A and UBE2C expressions correlate with poor prognosis in patients with surgically resected lung adenocarcinoma: a study based on immunohistochemical analysis and bioinformatics.', 'Screening key genes and signaling pathways in colorectal cancer by integrated bioinformatics analysis.', 'Bioinformatics analysis identified hub genes in prostate cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis.', 'Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2C: molecular biology, role in tumorigenesis, and potential as a biomarker.', 'Transcriptomic Signatures in Colorectal Cancer Progression.', 'A compendium of Androgen Receptor Variant 7 target genes and their role in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals Influence Hub Genes Associated with Aggressive Prostate Cancer.', 'In-depth systems biological evaluation of bovine alveolar macrophages suggests novel insights into molecular mechanisms underlying Mycobacterium bovis infection.', 'Overexpression of Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzyme E2C Is Associated with Worsened Prognosis in Prostate Cancer.', 'Identification of candidate hub genes correlated with the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and prognosis of prostate cancer by integrated bioinformatics analysis.']"""

The cost-effectiveness of the S3M test has not previously been assessed.  Methods:   We undertook a cost-effectiveness analysis from a lifetime societal perspective. Using a microsimulation model, we simulated for: (i) no prostate cancer screening; (ii) screening using the PSA test; and (iii) screening using the S3M test as a reflex test for PSA values ≥ 1, 1.5 and 2 ng/mL. Screening strategies included quadrennial re-testing for ages 55-69 years performed by a general practitioner. Discounted costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated.  Results:   Comparing S3M with a reflex threshold of 2 ng/mL with screening using the PSA test, S3M had increased effectiveness, reduced lifetime biopsies by 30%, and increased societal costs by 0.4%. Relative to the PSA test, the S3M reflex thresholds of 1, 1.5 and 2 ng/mL had ICERs of 170,000, 60,000 and 6,000 EUR/QALY, respectively. The S3M test was more cost-effective at higher biopsy costs.

Methods:   The National Cancer Database (2004-2015) identified men with TxN0M0 prostate cancer who either received or refused LT despite provider recommendation. Multivariable logistic regression defined adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with 95% CI of refusing LT, with sociodemographic and clinical covariates. Models were stratified by low-risk and intermediate- or high-risk (IR or HR) disease, with a separate interaction analysis between race and risk group. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard ratios compared overall survival (OS) among men who received versus refused LT.  Results:   Of 887,839 men (median age 64 years, median follow-up 6.14 years), 2,487 (0.28%) refused LT. Among men with IR or HR disease (n = 651,345), Black and Asian patients were more likely to refuse LT than White patients (0.35% v 0.29% v 0.17%; Black v White AOR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.52 to 2.01; P < .001; Asian v White AOR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.05 to 2.06; P = .027, race * risk group interaction P < .001). Later year of diagnosis, community facility type, noninsurance or Medicaid, and older age were also associated with increased odds of LT refusal, overall and when stratifying by risk group. For men with IR or HR disease, LT refusal was associated with worse OS (5-year OS 80.1% v 91.5%, HR, 1.65, P < .001).  Conclusion:   LT refusal has increased over time; racial disparities were greater in higher-risk disease.

Patients and methods:   Patients undergoing robot-assisted extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) from 2015 to 2019 at three teaching hospitals were retrospectively evaluated. Risk of LNI was calculated four times for each patient, using clinical tumour stage (T-stage) assessed by digital rectal examination (DRE) and by mpMRI, in the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre (MSKCC; 2018) and Briganti (2012) nomograms. Discrimination (area under the curve [AUC]), calibration, and the net benefit of these four strategies were assessed and compared.  Results:   A total of 1062 patients were included, of whom 301 (28%) had histologically proven LNI. Using DRE T-stage resulted in AUCs of 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70-0.72) for the MSKCC and 0.73 (95% CI 0.72-0.74) for the Briganti nomogram. Using mpMRI T-stage, the AUCs were 0.72 (95% CI 0.71-0.73) for the MSKCC and 0.75 (95% CI 0.74-0.76) for the Briganti nomogram. mpMRI T-stage resulted in equivalent calibration compared with DRE T-stage. Combined use of mpMRI T-stage and the Briganti 2012 nomogram was shown to be superior in terms of AUC, calibration, and net benefit. Use of mpMRI T-stage led to increased sensitivity for the detection of LNI for all risk thresholds in both models, countered by a decreased specificity, compared with DRE T-stage.

Knowledge of how porphyrins enter cancer cells can aid the development of more accurate cancer diagnostics and therapeutics. To gain insight into porphyrin uptake mechanisms in cancer cells, we developed a flow cytometry assay to quantify cellular uptake of meso-tetra (4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (TCPP), a porphyrin that is currently being developed for cancer diagnostics. We found that TCPP enters cancer cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The LDL receptor, previously implicated in the cellular uptake of other porphyrins, only contributes modestly to uptake. We report that TCPP instead binds strongly ( KD=42nM ) to CD320, the cellular receptor for cobalamin/transcobalamin II (Cbl/TCN2). Additionally, TCPP competes with Cbl/TCN2 for CD320 binding, suggesting that CD320 is a novel receptor for TCPP. Knockdown of CD320 inhibits TCPP uptake by up to 40% in multiple cancer cell lines, including lung, breast, and prostate cell lines, which supports our hypothesis that CD320 both binds to and transports TCPP into cancer cells. Our findings provide some novel insights into why porphyrins concentrate in cancer cells. Additionally, our study describes a novel function for the CD320 receptor which has been reported to transport only Cbl/TCN2 complexes.""","""['David J Elzi', 'William E Bauta', 'Jamila R Sanchez', 'Trisha Das', 'Shweta Mogare', 'Peter Zannes Fatland', 'Moises Iza', 'Alexander Pertsemlidis', 'Vivienne I Rebel']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""FASEB J""","""['Meso-tetra (carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (TCPP) nanoparticles were internalized by SW480 cells by a clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway to induce high photocytotoxicity.', 'Cellular uptake of vitamin B12: Role and fate of TCblR/CD320, the transcobalamin receptor.', 'Mapping the functional domains of TCblR/CD320, the receptor for cellular uptake of transcobalamin-bound cobalamin.', 'Cellular uptake of cobalamin: transcobalamin and the TCblR/CD320 receptor.', 'Cellular uptake and photosensitizing properties of anticancer porphyrins in cell membranes and low and high density lipoproteins.', 'Targeting and arginine-driven synergizing photodynamic therapy with nutritional immunotherapy nanosystems for combating MRSA biofilms.', 'Cobalamin (Vitamin B12) in Anticancer Photodynamic Therapy with Zn(II) Phthalocyanines.']"""

Case description:   This study concerns a 73-year-old man with bilateral hip prostheses with an elevated risk prostate cancer. Magnetic resonance images with assigned electron densities were used for planning purposes, generating a synthetic CT (sCT). Imaging acquisition was performed with an optimized Dixon sequence on a 1.5T MRI scanner. The images were contoured by autosegmentation software, based on an MRI database of 20 patients. The sCT was generated assigning averaged electron densities to each contour. Two volumetric modulated arc therapy plans, a complete arc and a partial one, where the beam entrances through the prostheses were avoided for about 50° on both sides, were compared. The feasibility of matching daily cone beam CT (CBCT) with MRI reference images was also tested by visual evaluations of different radiation oncologists.  Conclusions:   The use of magnetic resonance images improved accuracy in targets and organs at risk (OARs) contouring. The complete arc plan was chosen because of 10% lower mean and maximum doses to prostheses with the same planning target volume coverage and OAR sparing. The image quality of the match between performed CBCTs and MRI was considered acceptable.

The objective of this study is to explore the prognostic value of SII in patients with urinary system cancers (USCs).  Materials and methods:   A comprehensive literature search was conducted by searching the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang databases from inception to May 10, 2020, to identify potential studies that assessed the prognostic role of the SII in USCs. The hazard ratio (HR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to evaluate the correlation between SII and overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS) in USCs patients.  Results:   A total of 12 studies, including 2,693 USCs patients, were eventually included in the meta-analysis. Elevated SII index was significantly associated with poor OS (HR=1.28, 95% CI: 1.17-1.39, p<0.001), PFS (HR=1.51, 95% CI: 1.25-1.82, p<0.001) and CSS (HR=3.42, 95% CI: 1.49-7.91, p<0.001). Furthermore, subgroup analysis indicated that higher SII than a cutoff value could predict poor OS in renal cell carcinoma (HR=1.23, p<0.001), prostate carcinoma (HR=1.95, p<0.001), bladder carcinoma (HR=5.40, p<0.001), testicular cancer (HR=6.09, p<0.001) and upper tract urothelial carcinoma (HR=2.19, p<0.001). Besides, these associations did not vary significantly by tumor subtypes and stages of USCs, sample sizes, study types, cutoff value defining elevated NLR, treatment methods, and NOS scores.

Methods:   ANO7 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in 17,747 clinical PCa specimens.  Results:   ANO7 was strongly expressed in normal prostate glandular cells but often less abundant in cancer cells. ANO7 staining was interpretable in 13,594 cancer tissues and considered strong in 34.4%, moderate in 48.7%, weak in 9.3%, and negative in 7.6%. Reduced staining was tightly linked to adverse tumor features [high classical and quantitative Gleason grade, lymph node metastasis, advanced tumor stage, high Ki67 labeling index, positive surgical margin, and early biochemical recurrence (P < 0.0001 each)]. The univariate Cox hazard ratio for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence after prostatectomy in patients with negative vs. strong ANO7 expression was 2.98 (95% confidence interval 2.61-3.38). The prognostic impact was independent of established pre- or postoperatively available parameters (P < 0.0001). Analysis of annotated molecular data showed that low ANO7 expression was linked to TMPRSS2:ERG fusions (P < 0.0001), elevated androgen receptor expression (P < 0.0001), as well as presence of 9 of 11 chromosomal deletions (P < 0.05 each). A particularly strong association of low ANO7 expression with phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) deletion may indicate a functional relationship with the PTEN/AKT pathway.

In order to analyze the effects of DNA methylation on prostate cancer, we established LNCaP-derived human prostate cancer cells that can pharmacologically induce global reactivation of hypermethylated genes by the methyl-CpG targeted transcriptional activation (MeTA) method. The MeTA suppressed the growth of LNCaP-derived cells and induced apoptosis. Microarray analysis indicated that PYCARD (PYD and CARD domain containing) encoding an apoptosis-inducing factor was upregulated by 65-fold or more after treatment with MeTA. We analyzed DNA methylation statuses using 50 microdissected primary prostate cancer tissues and found an extremely high frequency of tumor-specific promoter hypermethylation of PYCARD (90%, 45/50). Moreover, DNA methylation status was significantly associated with Gleason score (P = 0.0063); the frequency of tumor-specific hypermethylation was 96% (44/46) in tumors with Gleason score ≥ 7, whereas that in tumors with Gleason score 6 was 25% (1/4). Immunohistochemical analyses using these 50 cases indicated that only 8% (4/50) of cancerous tissues expressed PYCARD, whereas 80% (40/50) of corresponding normal prostate epithelial and/or basal cells expressed PYCARD. In addition, there was no relationship between PYCARD immunostaining and the Gleason score in cancerous tissue and surrounding normal tissue. Inducible expression of PYCARD inhibited cell proliferation by induction of apoptosis.

Deregulation of CBL and its E3 activity is observed in myeloproliferative neoplasms and other cancers, including breast, colon, and prostate cancer. Here, we explore the oncogenic mechanism of E3-inactive CBL mutants identified in myeloproliferative neoplasms. We show that these mutants bind strongly to CIN85 under normal growth conditions and alter the CBL interactome. Lack of E3 activity deregulates CIN85 endosomal trafficking, leading to an altered transcriptome that amplifies signaling events to promote oncogenesis. Disruption of CBL mutant interactions with EGFR or CIN85 reduces oncogenic transformation. Given the importance of the CBL-CIN85 interaction in breast cancers, we examined the expression levels of CIN85, CBL, and the status of Tyr371-phosphorylated CBL (pCBL) in human breast cancer tissue microarrays. Interestingly, pCBL shows an inverse correlation with both CIN85 and CBL, suggesting that high expression of inactivated CBL could coordinate with CIN85 for breast cancer progression. Inhibition of the CBL-CIN85 interaction with a proline-rich peptide of CBL that binds CIN85 reduced the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells.

Results:   Compared with noncancer controls, sphingomyelin (P: 0.01), ceramide (P: 0.04), and phosphatidylethanolamine (P: 0.03) circulating levels were enriched among ERG-positive prostate cancer cases. Sphingomyelins (P: 0.02), ceramides (P: 0.005), and amino acids (P: 0.02) were enriched among tumors exhibiting PTEN-loss; unsaturated diacylglycerols (P: 0.003) were enriched among PTEN-intact cases; and unsaturated triacylglycerols were enriched among both PTEN-loss (P: 0.001) and PTEN-intact (P: 0.0001) cases. Although several individual metabolites identified in the above categories were nominally associated with ERG or PTEN-defined prostate cancer, none remained significant after accounting for multiple testing.  Conclusions:   The molecular process of prostate carcinogenesis may be distinct for men with different metabolomic profiles.

Materials and methods:   In this study, PC patients suspected of recurrence underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT. Early static images were acquired from the pelvis and the lower abdomen 3-5 minutes after radiotracer injection and, a routine whole body scan was performed from the skull to the mid-thigh 1 h after injection. Quantitative analysis (SUVmax) was evaluated in suspicious lesions.  Results:   Of 19 evaluated PC patients with a median age of 72 ± 1.66 years (range: 55-85 years) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 1.72 ± 6.11 ng/ml (range: 0.1-100 ng/ml) (median ± SE), 16 showed positive in the whole body PET/CT. All of the patients with positive whole body scans due to pelvic involvement had positive early scan results. Totally, 22 lesions were detected in both early and delay scans in the pelvic which 16 were related to prostate involvement, 4 were related to lymph node involvement, and 2 were related to bone involvement. Moreover, in addition to the mentioned 22 lesions, early PET imaging successfully detected local recurrence in a patient who was negative on WB PET/ CT; this lesion was masked in the delay scan due to bladder activity. The median SUVmax values of the early and delay scans were 3.69 ± 1.07 (median ± SE) (range: 1.2-14.5) and 5.85 ± 1.69 (range: 3.1-23.4), respectively. (p = 0.005).

Tumour growth and the functional and morphological alterations of the microvasculature were analysed for 21 days in vivo using a transparent bone chamber and fluorescence microscopy.  Results:   Vascular density was significantly lower in tumour-bearing bone than in non-tumour-bearing bone, with a marked loss of small vessels. Accelerated blood flow velocity led to increased volumetric blood flow per vessel, but overall perfusion was not affected. All of the prostate cancer cell lines had similar vascular patterns, with more pronounced alterations in rapidly growing tumours. Despite minor differences between the prostate cancer cell lines associated with individual growth behaviours, the same overall pattern was observed and showed strong similarity to that of tumours growing in soft tissue.

Patients and methods:   To examine the association of gBRCA2 mutations and other tumour molecular features with IDC and/or cribriform (CRIB) histologies, we conducted a case-control study in which primary prostate tumours from 58 gBRCA2 carriers were matched (1:2) by Gleason Grade Group and specimen type to 116 non-carriers. Presence/absence of IDC and CRIB morphologies was established by two expert uropathologists blinded to gBRCA2 status. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) were used to detect BRCA2 alterations, PTEN deletions and TMPRSS2-ERG fusions. Chi-squared tests were used to compare the frequency of IDC and CRIB in gBRCA2 carriers and controls and to assess associations with other variables. Logistic regression models were constructed to identify independent factors associated with both histology patterns.  Results:   No significant differences between gBRCA2 carriers and non-carriers were observed in the prevalence of IDC (36% gBRCA2 versus 50% non-carriers, p = 0.085) or CRIB (53% gBRCA2 versus 43% non-carriers p = 0.197) patterns. However, IDC histology was independently associated with bi-allelic BRCA2 alterations (OR 4.3, 95%CI 1.1-16.2) and PTEN homozygous loss (OR 5.2, 95%CI 2.1-13.1). CRIB morphology was also independently associated with bi-allelic BRCA2 alterations (OR 5.6, 95%CI 1.7-19.3).

The prevalence of PSA testing in young men is unknown and may be an appropriate target for improving health care by decreasing low-value testing in this age group. The purpose of this study was to determine PSA testing rates in men younger than current guidelines support.  Materials and methods:   Health Informational National Trends Surveys (HINTS) from 2011 to 2014 and 2017 were analyzed to establish the prevalence of PSA testing in young men and to evaluate the differences in testing rates based on race.  Results:   The combined survey data included 5178 men, with 2393 reporting previous PSA screening. Of men ages 18-39, 7% recalled receipt of PSA testing. Twenty-two percent of men between the ages of 40 and 44 had been tested. Among men under age 40, PSA testing was more common among black men (14%) compared to white men (7%), Hispanics (6%), and men of Asian descent (8%). Logistic regression modeling demonstrates that black men under the age of 40 were more likely to undergo PSA testing than other racial or ethnic groups (odds ratio 2.14; 95% CI 1.17, 3.93).  Conclusions:   Current guidelines do not recommend routine PSA testing in average-risk men under the age of 40. This study found that a significant number of young men are exposed to testing, with the greatest risk among black men. This suggests that there is an opportunity to improve the value of PSA testing by decreasing testing in young men.""","""['Suzanne M Lange', 'Jacob P Ambrose', 'Michael C Flynn', 'William T Lowrance', 'Heidi A Hanson', ""Brock B O'Neil""]""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Probability of an abnormal screening prostate-specific antigen result based on age, race, and prostate-specific antigen threshold.', 'Use of lower prostate specific antigen cutoffs for prostate cancer screening in black and white men.', 'Prostate specific antigen levels in young adulthood predict prostate cancer risk: results from a cohort of Black and White Americans.', 'Temporal trends and racial disparities in global prostate cancer prevalence.', 'Population screening for prostate cancer and emerging concepts for young men.', 'Letter to the editor for the article ""Histopathological results of radical prostatectomy specimen of men younger than 50\xa0years of age at the time of surgery: possible implications for prostate cancer screening programs?"".']"""

Dynamic aberrations in the androgen receptor, DNA repair genes, PTEN-PI3K, and other pathways drive the behavior of advanced prostate cancer allowing a better selection of therapies in each patient. Tumor testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 is recommended for patients with metastatic prostate cancer, also considering a broad panel to guide decisions and genetic counseling. In symptomatic metastatic patients, castration should be stared to palliate symptoms and prolong survival. In high-risk or high-volume metastatic hormone-naïve patients, castration should be combined with docetaxel, abiraterone, enzalutamide or apalutamide. Radiotherapy to the primary tumor combined with systemic therapy is recommended in low-volume mHNPC patients. In patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant tumors, risk stratification can define the frequency of imaging. Adding enzalutamide, darolutamide or apalutamide to these patients prolongs metastasis-free and overall survival, but potential adverse events need to be taken into consideration. The choice of docetaxel, abiraterone or enzalutamide for treating metastatic castration-resistant patients depends on previous therapies, with cabazitaxel being also recommended after docetaxel. Olaparib is recommended in BRCA1/BRCA2 mutated castration-resistant patients after progression on at least one new hormonal therapy. Aggressive variants of prostate cancer respond to platinum-based chemotherapy. To optimize treatment efficiency, oncologists should incorporate all of these advances into an overall therapeutic strategy.""","""['A González Del Alba', 'M J Méndez-Vidal', 'S Vazquez', 'E Castro', 'M A Climent', 'E Gallardo', 'E Gonzalez-Billalabeitia', 'D Lorente', 'J P Maroto', 'J A Arranz']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Clin Transl Oncol""","""['Treating Patients with Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review of Available Therapies.', 'Olaparib for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'The evolving options in metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Treatment of Primary in Metastatic Prostate Cancer: What Is the Standard of Care?', 'Efficacy of systemic therapies in men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer harboring germline ATM versus BRCA2 mutations.', 'Guidelines for genetic testing in prostate cancer: a scoping review.', 'Gender bias in shared decision-making among cancer care guidelines: A systematic review.', 'Unravelling oligometastatic disease from the perspective of radiation and medical oncology.

Adherence to guideline-recommended assessment and management of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) in patients initiating ADT is unknown.  Objective:   To describe CVRF assessment and management in men with prostate cancer initiating ADT and overall.  Design, setting, and participants:   A cross-sectional analysis of 90 494 men treated within the US Veterans Health Administration diagnosed with prostate cancer between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2017, was conducted. Participants included men with a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and treatment with ADT within 1 year of diagnosis. Data analysis was conducted from September 10, 2019, to July 1, 2020.  Main outcomes and measures:   Rates of comprehensive CVRF assessment, uncontrolled CVRFs, and untreated CVRFs. Comprehensive CVRF assessment was defined as recorded measures for blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose levels; CVRF control as blood pressure lower than 140/90 mm Hg, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 130 mg/dL, and hemoglobin A1c less than 7%; and CVRF treatment as receipt of cardiac risk-reducing medications. Multivariable risk difference regression assessed the association between ASCVD and initiation of ADT and these outcomes.  Results:   Of 90 494 veterans, median age was 66 years (interquartile range, 62-70 years); and 22 700 men (25.1%) received ADT. Overall, 68.1% (95% CI, 67.8%-68.3%) of the men received comprehensive CVRF assessment; 54.1% (95% CI. 53.7%-54.4%) of those assessed had uncontrolled CVRFs, and 29.6% (95% CI, 29.2%-30.0%) of those with uncontrolled CVRFs were not receiving corresponding cardiac risk-reducing medication. Compared with the reference group of patients without ASCVD not receiving ADT, patients with ASCVD not receiving ADT had a 10.4% (95% CI, 9.5%-11.3%) higher probability of comprehensive CVRF assessment, 4.0% (95% CI, 2.9%-5.1%) lower risk of uncontrolled CVRFs, and 22.2% (95% CI, 21.1%-23.3%) lower risk of untreated CVRFs. Similar differences were observed in patients with ASCVD receiving ADT. In contrast, patients without ASCVD receiving ADT had only a 3.0% (95% CI, 2.1%-3.9%) higher probability of comprehensive CVRF assessment, 2.6% (95% CI, 1.6%-3.5%) higher risk of uncontrolled CVRFs, and 5.4% (95% CI, 4.2%-6.6%) lower risk of untreated CVRFs.  Conclusions and relevance:   These findings suggest that veterans with prostate cancer had a high rate of underassessed and undertreated CVRFs, and ADT initiation was not associated with substantial improvements in CVRF assessment or management. These findings highlight gaps in care and the need for interventions to improve CVRF mitigation in this population.""","""['Lova Sun', 'Ravi B Parikh', 'Rebecca A Hubbard', 'John Cashy', 'Samuel U Takvorian', 'David J Vaughn', 'Kyle W Robinson', 'Vivek Narayan', 'Bonnie Ky']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Association of Bone Mineral Density Testing With Risk of Major Osteoporotic Fractures Among Older Men Receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy to Treat Localized or Regional Prostate Cancer.', 'Suboptimal control of lipid levels: results from the non-interventional Centralized Pan-Russian Survey of the Undertreatment of Hypercholesterolemia II (CEPHEUS II).', 'The need for androgen deprivation therapy in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with dose-escalated external beam radiation therapy.', 'Pharmacologic androgen deprivation and cardiovascular disease risk factors: a systematic review.', 'Increased risk of metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Comorbidity burden and health-related quality of life in men with advanced prostate cancer.', 'Approaches to Prevent and Manage Cardiovascular Disease in Patients Receiving Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Temporal trends in cardiovascular burden among patients with prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy: a population-based cohort study.', 'The Burden of Uncontrolled Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Men\xa0With\xa0Prostate Cancer: A RADICAL-PC Analysis.', 'Comorbidity burden and health-related quality of life in men with advanced prostate cancer.']"""

In this study we report our practice's experience using the Know Error test to verify prostate biopsy specimens. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed the results of a specific SPT known as Know Error which is used in our institution for specimen verification during prostate biopsy. Over a period of 16 months, we identified 445 patients with a total of 921 specimens. The percentage of patients who had 1, 2 or 3 specimens analyzed was 29%, 38%, and 30%, respectively.

CONDOR was a prospective study designed to determine the performance of 18F-DCFPyL-PET/CT in patients with BCR and uninformative standard imaging.  Experimental design:   Men with rising PSA ≥0.2 ng/mL after prostatectomy or ≥2 ng/mL above nadir after radiotherapy were eligible. The primary endpoint was correct localization rate (CLR), defined as positive predictive value with an additional requirement of anatomic lesion colocalization between 18F-DCFPyL-PET/CT and a composite standard of truth (SOT). The SOT consisted of, in descending priority (i) histopathology, (ii) subsequent correlative imaging findings, or (iii) post-radiation PSA response. The trial was considered a success if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for CLR exceeded 20% for two of three 18F-DCFPyL-PET/CT readers. Secondary endpoints included change in intended management and safety.  Results:   A total of 208 men with a median baseline PSA of 0.8 ng/mL (range: 0.2-98.4 ng/mL) underwent 18F-DCFPyL-PET/CT. The CLR was 84.8%-87.0% (lower bound of 95% CI: 77.8-80.4). A total of 63.9% of evaluable patients had a change in intended management after 18F-DCFPyL-PET/CT.

However, the exact mechanism of PSMA inhibitor internalization has not yet been studied, and the inhibitors' subcellular fate remains elusive. Here, we investigated the intracellular distribution of peptidomimetic PSMA inhibitors and of PSMA itself by stimulated emission depletion (STED) nanoscopy, applying a novel nonstandard live cell staining protocol. Imaging analysis confirmed PSMA cluster formation at the cell surface of prostate cancer cells and clathrin-dependent endocytosis of PSMA inhibitors. Following the endosomal pathway, PSMA inhibitors accumulated in prostate cancer cells at clinically relevant time points. In contrast with PSMA itself, PSMA inhibitors were found to eventually distribute homogeneously in the cytoplasm, a molecular condition that promises benefits for treatment as cytoplasmic and in particular perinuclear enrichment of the radionuclide carriers may better facilitate the radiation-mediated damage of cancerous cells. This study is the first to reveal the subcellular fate of PSMA/PSMA inhibitor complexes at the nanoscale and aims to inspire the development of new approaches in the field of prostate cancer research, diagnostics, and therapeutics. SIGNIFICANCE: This study uses STED fluorescence microscopy to reveal the subcellular fate of PSMA/PSMA inhibitor complexes near the molecular level, providing insights of great clinical interest and suggestive of advantageous targeted therapies.

Methods:   Newly diagnosed patients with Ta UCUB treated with transurethral resection of bladder tumour were abstracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database (2010-2016). Kaplan-Meier plots and multivariable Cox regression models (CRMs) tested cancer-specific mortality (CSM), according to 1973 WHO (G1 vs G2 vs G3) and to 2004/2016 WHO (low-grade vs high-grade) grading systems.  Results:   Of 35 986 patients, according to 1973 WHO grading system, 8165 (22.7%) were G1, 17 136 (47.6%) were G2 and 10 685 (29.7%) were G3. According to 2004/2016 WHO grading system, 24 961 (69.4%) were low-grade versus 11 025 (30.6%) high-grade. In multivariable CRMs, G3 (HR: 2.05, p<0.001), relative to G1, and high-grade(HR: 2.13, p<0.001), relative to low-grade, predicted higher CSM. Conversely, G2 (p=0.8) was not an independent predictor. The multivariable models without consideration of either grading system were 74% accurate in predicting 5-year CSM. After addition of 1973 WHO or 2004/2016 WHO grade, the accuracy increased to 76% and 77%, respectively.  Conclusions:   From a statistical standpoint, it appears that the 2004/2016 WHO grading system holds a small, although measurable advantage over the 1973 WHO grading system.

Methods:   To establish a model using plasma miRs to distinguish Prostate cancer patients from non-cancer controls, we enrolled 600 patients histologically diagnosed as having or not prostate cancer at biopsy. Two hundred ninety patients were eligible for the analysis. Samples were randomly divided into discovery and validation cohorts.  Results:   NGS-miR-expression profiling revealed a miRs signature able to distinguish prostate cancer from non-cancer plasma samples. Of 51 miRs selected in the discovery cohort, we successfully validated 5 miRs (4732-3p, 98-5p, let-7a-5p, 26b-5p, and 21-5p) deregulated in prostate cancer samples compared to controls (p ≤ 0.05). Multivariate and ROC analyses show miR-26b-5p as a strong predictor of PCa, with an AUC of 0.89 (CI = 0.83-0.95;p < 0.001). Combining miRs 26b-5p and 98-5p, we developed a model that has the best predictive power in discriminating prostate cancer from non-cancer (AUC = 0.94; CI: 0,835-0,954). To distinguish between low and high-grade prostate cancer, we found that miR-4732-3p levels were significantly higher; instead, miR-26b-5p and miR-98-5p levels were lower in low-grade compared to the high-grade group (p ≤ 0.05). Combining miR-26b-5p and miR-4732-3p we have the highest diagnostic accuracy for high-grade prostate cancer patients, (AUC = 0.80; CI 0,69-0,873).

Results:   We extracted 2 DLVC constraints. One DLVC was obtained, Vdose/LETboundary:2.5keVμmat 75 Gy to 3.2keVμmat8.65Gy <1.27% (DLVC1), revealing a high LET volume effect. The second DLVC, V(72.2Gy,0keVμm) < 2.23% (DVLC2), revealed a high dose volume effect. The SVM-based NTCP model with 2 DLVCs provided slightly superior performance than using dose only, with an area under the curve of 0.798 versus 0.779 for the testing data set.  Conclusions:   Our results demonstrated the importance of rectal ""hot spots"" in both high LET (DLVC1) and high dose (DLVC2) in inducing rectal bleeding.

Emerging evidence suggests that patients with a cancer diagnosis are three times more likely to die from COVID-19 compared to non-cancer patients. Due to these observed risks, it is critical that emerging COVID-19 therapies demonstrate safety and efficacy among patients with cancer.  Aim:   This study sought to examine reporting and representation of patients with cancer among published COVID-19 treatment-related research studies.  Methods and results:   All published COVID-19 treatment-related clinical research studies published from March 1 to August 20, 2020 recruiting from North America and Europe were identified. The date published, study design, therapeutics studied, and study population were evaluated. Of the 343 studies identified through initial search and researcher knowledge, 55 (16%) reported on COVID-19 treatments. Twenty-one COVID-19 therapeutic studies (n = 15, prospective; n = 6, retrospective) that recruited from the United States and Europe were identified. Among these studies, eight (38%) reported on the number of trial participants with a cancer diagnosis in the publication and two (10%) specified tumor type. Four of the studies (19%) did not collect cancer history. Among studies where cancer history was available, patients with a cancer diagnosis participated at a proportion higher than overall cancer prevalence and greater than the known proportion of COVID-19 patients with cancer.  Conclusion:   This study observed that cancer history was not uniformly collected or reported among published COVID-19 therapeutic studies. Among reported publications, we observed that patients with a cancer diagnosis were generally overrepresented. However, patients with a cancer diagnosis were notably underrepresented in outpatient COVID-19 therapeutic studies.""","""['Maya Rabow', 'Christine Wang', 'Sylvia Zhang', 'Peggy Mary Tahir', 'Eric J Small', 'Hala T Borno']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Rep (Hoboken)""","""['Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of cancer patients with COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis of global data.', 'COVID-19 and oncological disease.', 'COVID-19 Infection in Children With Cancer: Not A Gloomy Picture.', 'Impact of COVID-19 on cancer patients: A review.', 'Cancer diagnosis in Brazil in the COVID-19 era.', 'Assessing Unique Risk Factors for COVID-19 Complications Among Cancer Patients: A Multi-ethnic Cohort Study.']"""

The gold standard for diagnosis and prognosis is the Gleason grading system. In this process, pathologists manually analyze prostate histology slides under microscope, in a high time-consuming and subjective task. In the last years, computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) systems have emerged as a promising tool that could support pathologists in the daily clinical practice. Nevertheless, these systems are usually trained using tedious and prone-to-error pixel-level annotations of Gleason grades in the tissue. To alleviate the need of manual pixel-wise labeling, just a handful of works have been presented in the literature. Furthermore, despite the promising results achieved on global scoring the location of cancerous patterns in the tissue is only qualitatively addressed. These heatmaps of tumor regions, however, are crucial to the reliability of CAD systems as they provide explainability to the system's output and give confidence to pathologists that the model is focusing on medical relevant features. Motivated by this, we propose a novel weakly-supervised deep-learning model, based on self-learning CNNs, that leverages only the global Gleason score of gigapixel whole slide images during training to accurately perform both, grading of patch-level patterns and biopsy-level scoring. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we perform extensive experiments on three different external datasets for the patch-level Gleason grading, and on two different test sets for global Grade Group prediction. We empirically demonstrate that our approach outperforms its supervised counterpart on patch-level Gleason grading by a large margin, as well as state-of-the-art methods on global biopsy-level scoring. Particularly, the proposed model brings an average improvement on the Cohen's quadratic kappa ( κ) score of nearly 18% compared to full-supervision for the patch-level Gleason grading task. This suggests that the absence of the annotator's bias in our approach and the capability of using large weakly labeled datasets during training leads to higher performing and more robust models. Furthermore, raw features obtained from the patch-level classifier showed to generalize better than previous approaches in the literature to the subjective global biopsy-level scoring.""","""['Julio Silva-Rodriguez', 'Adrian Colomer', 'Jose Dolz', 'Valery Naranjo']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""IEEE J Biomed Health Inform""","""['WeGleNet: A weakly-supervised convolutional neural network for the semantic segmentation of Gleason grades in prostate histology images.', 'Going deeper through the Gleason scoring scale: An automatic end-to-end system for histology prostate grading and cribriform pattern detection.', 'Semi-supervised training of deep convolutional neural networks with heterogeneous data and few local annotations: An experiment on prostate histopathology image classification.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.', 'Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'Contrastive Multiple Instance Learning: An Unsupervised Framework for Learning Slide-Level Representations of Whole Slide Histopathology Images without Labels.', 'A Deep Learning Model for Prostate Adenocarcinoma Classification in Needle Biopsy Whole-Slide Images Using Transfer Learning.']"""

Patients and methods:   80 patients who underwent TURBT for lateral wall-located primary bladder tumors under ONB from March, 2016 to November, 2019 were included in the present study. The patients were randomized equally into two groups; monopolar TUR (M-TURBT) and bipolar TUR (B-TURBT). The primary and secondary outcomes were safety (obturator jerk and bladder perforation) and efficacy (complete tumor resection and sampling of the deep muscle tissue).  Results:   Obturator jerk was detected in 2 patients (5%) in M-TURBT while obturator jerk was not observed during B-TURBT (p=0.494). Bladder perforation was not observed in both groups. All of the patients underwent complete tumor resection. There was no significant difference in muscle tissue sampling (67.5% vs. 72.5%, p=0.626) and thermal tissue damage rates (12.5% vs. 25%, p=0.201). The majority of complications were low-grade and the differences in Clavien grade 1-3 complications between groups were not statistically significant.  Conclusion:   In the treatment of lateral-wall located NMIBCs, either M-TURBT or B-TURBT can be safely and effectively performed by combining spinal anesthesia with ONB.

Limited access to the health system or more aggressive disease are potential reasons for this. Ethnic and social differences in developed countries seem to make inappropriate to extrapolate data from other centers. We aim to report the epidemiological profile of a PSA-screened population from a cancer center in Brazil.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively selected 9.692 men enrolled in a PCa prevention program, comprising total PSA level and digital rectal examination at the first appointment, associated with complementary tests when necessary. Men aged over 40 years-old were included after shared decision-making process. Prostate biopsy (TRUS) was performed when clinically suspected for PCa. After the diagnosis, patients underwent appropriate treatment.  Results:   TRUS was performed in 5.5% of men and PCa incidence was 2.6%. Overall ratio between number of patients who needed to be screened in order to diagnose one cancer was 38.9 patients, with 2.1 biopsies performed to diagnose a cancer. Positive predictive value (PPV) of TRUS biopsy in this strategy was 47.2%, varying from 38.5% (<50 years-old) to 60% (>80 years-old). We evidenced 70 patients (27.9%) classified as low risk tumors, 74 (29.5%) as intermediate risk, and 107 (42.6%) as high-risk disease.  Conclusions:   PSA-screening remains controversial in literature. In front of a huge miscegenated people and considering the big proportion of high-risk PCa, even in young men diagnosed with the disease, it is imperative to inform patients and health providers about these data particularities in Brazil.""","""['Renato Almeida Rosa de Oliveira', 'Gustavo Cardoso Guimarães', 'Thiago Camelo Mourão', 'Ricardo de Lima Favaretto', 'Thiago Borges Marques Santana', 'Ademar Lopes', 'Stenio de Cassio Zequi']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int Braz J Urol""","""['Use of low free to total PSA ratio in prostate cancer screening: detection rates, clinical and pathological findings in Brazilian men with serum PSA levels <4.0 ng/mL.', 'Association between family history of prostate cancer and positive biopsies in a Brazilian screening program.', 'Prostate cancer screening among elderly men in Brazil: should we diagnose or not?', 'Evaluation of prostate specific antigen density and transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsies in 100 consecutive patients with a negative digital rectal examination and intermediate serum prostate specific antigen levels.', 'Screening for prostate cancer.', 'Complication rates of transrectal and transperineal prostate fusion biopsies - is there a learning curve even in high volume interventional center?', 'Using ""Age and Total-PSA"" as the Main Indicators: The Results of Taizhou Integrated Prostate Screening (No 2).', 'Prostate cancer mortality and costs of prostate surgical procedures in the Brazilian public health system.', 'Optimal PSA Threshold for Obtaining MRI-Fusion Biopsy in Biopsy-Naïve Patients.', 'Infertility highlighted in International Brazilian Journal of Urology.']"""

Methods:   Using Swedish family cancer data sets, the authors conducted a nationwide cohort study including 5,099,172 Swedish women born after 1931 (follow-up, 1958-2015). Accounting for calendar time, they calculated the relative risk of breast cancer for women with a family history of a discordant cancer in 1 first-degree relative. Furthermore, the authors used 10-year cumulative risk to determine the ages at which women with a family history of discordant cancer reached risk thresholds at which women in the general population were recommended to start breast cancer screening.  Results:   A family history of cancer at 15 sites was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Among women younger than 50 years, the highest risk of breast cancer was observed for those with a family history of ovarian cancer (standardized incidence ratio, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-1.64). In these women, the risk of breast cancer associated with a family history at other cancer sites ranged from 1.08-fold for prostate cancer to 1.18-fold for liver cancer. When breast cancer screening was recommended to be started at the age of 50 years for the general population, women with 1 first-degree relative with ovarian cancer attained the threshold risk for screening at the age of 46 years.

If US biopsy is negative, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided biopsy is recommended, despite a low specificity for lesions with score 3-5 on Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PIRADS). Screening and biopsy guidance using an imaging modality with high accuracy could reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies, reducing side effects.

Methods:   Prospective, open-label, single-center, non-randomized, diagnostic accuracy study including patients with suspected PCa by elevation of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and a suspicious lesion (PIRADS ≥3) on multiparametric MRI (mpMRI). Forty-two patients underwent PSMA-PET/MRI followed by both PSMA-PET/MRI-guided and section-based saturation template biopsy between May 2017 and February 2019. Primary outcome was the accuracy of PSMA-PET/MRI for biopsy guidance using section-based saturation template biopsy as the reference standard.  Results:   SigPCa was found in 62% of the patients.

Objective:   The aim of this study was to predict the survival of patients with SMPCa by establishing an effective prognostic nomogram model, associating with the affecting factors and compare its efficacy with the existing scoring models.  Summary of background data:   Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most frequently malignant cancer causing death in men, and the spine is the most common site of bone metastatic burden. The aim of this study was to establish a prognostic nomogram for survival prediction of patients with SMPCa, explore associated factors, and compare the effectiveness of the new nomogram prediction model with the existing scoring systems.  Methods:   Included in this study were 84 SMPCa patients who were admitted in our spinal tumor center between 2006 and 2018. Their clinical data were retrospectively analyzed by univariate and multivariate analyses to identify independent variables that enabled to predict prognosis. A nomogram, named Changzheng Nomogram for Survival Prediction (CNSP), was established on the basis of preoperative independent variables, and then subjected to bootstrap re-samples for internal validation. The predictive accuracy and discriminative ability were measured by concordance index (C-index). Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with the corresponding area under the ROC was used to estimate the prediction efficacy of CNSP and compare it with the four existing prognostic models Tomita, Tokuhashi, Bauer, and Crnalic.  Results:   A total of seven independent variables including Gleason score (P = 0.001), hormone refractory (P < 0.001), visceral metastasis (P < 0.001), lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (P = 0.009), prostate-specific antigen (P = 0.018), fPSA/tPSA (P = 0.029), Karnofsky Performance Status (P = 0.039) were identified after accurate analysis, and then entered the nomogram with the C-index of 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.84-0.90). The calibration curves for probability of 12-, 24-, and 36-month overall survival (OS) showed good consistency between the predictive risk and the actual risk. Compared with the previous prognostic models, the CNSP model was significantly more effective than the four existing prognostic models in predicting OS of the SMPCa patients (p < 0.05).  Conclusion:   The overall performance of the CNSP model was satisfactory and could be used to estimate the survival outcome of individual patients more precisely and thus help clinicians design more specific and individualized therapeutic regimens.Level of Evidence: 4.""","""['Yujie Liu', 'Lin Li', 'Dongjie Jiang', 'Minglei Yang', 'Xin Gao', 'Kai Lv', 'Wei Xu', 'Haifeng Wei', 'Wei Wan', 'Jianru Xiao']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Spine (Phila Pa 1976)""","""['Development of a novel model for predicting survival of patients with spine metastasis from colorectal cancer.', 'Development and Validation of a Novel Survival Prediction Model in Patients With Spinal Metastasis From Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Establishment and validation of nomogram model for survival predicting in patients with spinal metastases secondary to lung cancer.', 'Scoring Algorithms for Predicting Survival Prognosis in Patients With Metastatic Spinal Disease: The Current Status and Future Directions.', 'Prognostic scores for survival as decisional support for surgery in spinal metastases: a performance assessment systematic review.', 'PPP1R81 correlates with the survival and cell proliferation in lower-grade glioma.', 'Prognostic factors and outcomes of surgical intervention for patients with spinal metastases secondary to lung cancer: an update systematic review and meta analysis.', 'Gleason score, surgical and distant metastasis are associated with cancer-specific survival and overall survival in middle aged high-risk prostate cancer: A population-based study.', 'A Web-Based Prediction Model for Cancer-Specific Survival of Elderly Patients Undergoing Surgery With Prostate Cancer: A Population-Based Study.', 'Identification of CDK2-Related Immune Forecast Model and ceRNA in Lung Adenocarcinoma, a Pan-Cancer Analysis.']"""

Recent studies highlighted that these amplifications not only span the AR gene but usually encompass a distal enhancer. This represents a newly recognised, non-coding mechanism of resistance to AR-directed therapies, including enzalutamide. To study disease progression before and after AR amplification, we used tumour samples from a castrate-sensitive primary tumour and castrate-resistant metastasis of the same patient. For subsequent functional and genomic studies, we established serially transplantable patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Whole genome sequencing showed that alterations associated with poor prognosis, such as TP53 and PTEN loss, existed before androgen deprivation therapy, followed by co-amplification of the AR gene and enhancer after the development of metastatic CRPC. The PDX of the primary tumour, without the AR amplification, was sensitive to AR-directed treatments, including castration, enzalutamide, and apalutamide. The PDX of the metastasis, with the AR amplification, had higher AR and AR-V7 expression in castrate conditions, and was resistant to castration, apalutamide, and enzalutamide in vivo. Treatment with a BET inhibitor outperformed the AR-directed therapies for the metastasis, resulting in tumour regression for some, but not all, grafts. Therefore, this study provides novel matched PDXs to test potential treatments that target the overabundance of AR in tumours with AR enhancer amplifications. © 2021 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Adequately skilled assistants are not always available. We assessed a purpose-designed robotic surgeon-controlled suction catheter for efficiency and safety by comparing with historic cases of suction controlled by a dedicated bedside assistant using standard rigid laparoscopic suction. Methods: Beginning in February 2019, the remotely operated suction irrigation (ROSI) device was used in all robotic prostatectomy procedures, which is a flexible suction catheter manipulated by the surgeon such that a bedside assistant is never required for suction. The initial 300 consecutive cases performed with ROSI were compared with the 300 immediately previous procedures using bedside assistant suction (BAS). Results: There were no statistically significant differences between groups in age, body mass index, American Anesthesiologist Association score, prostate specific antigen, or pathologic stage. Lymph node dissection was performed in all 600 patients. All 300 ROSI cases were completed without requiring switching to BAS. Estimated blood loss (102.7 vs 120.2 mL, p = 0.001) and operative time (156.1 vs 149.3 minutes, p < 0.001) were slightly lower in the ROSI group. There was no statistical difference in the 90-day complication rate (Clavien ≥III) between groups, with both having 3% of patients readmitted or seen in the emergency department within 90 days of surgery. Conclusion: Surgeon-controlled suction allowed more surgeon autonomy without a negative impact on efficiency or safety issues requiring ""bailout"" suctioning by the bedside assistant whether urgent or otherwise. Robotic surgeons without access to skilled bedside assistants should consider suctioning for themselves not unlike the norm for many laparoscopic surgeons.""","""['Oscar Martinez', 'Christopher Murphy', 'Aya Bsatee', 'David Hugh Brown ', ' Jr', 'Ronney Abaza']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Serving as a bedside surgeon before performing robotic radical prostatectomy improves surgical outcomes.', 'Quantifying the ""Assistant Effect"" in Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy (RARP): Measures of Technical Performance.', 'Does the experience of the bedside assistant effect the results of robotic surgeons in the learning curve of robot assisted radical prostatectomy?', 'The effect of bedside assistant technical performance on outcomes in robotic surgery.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Perioperative and oncologic outcomes of single-port versus conventional robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy: an evidence-based analysis of comparative outcomes.', 'Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: Advancements in surgical technique and perioperative care.', 'A neurotechnological aid for semi-autonomous suction in robotic-assisted surgery.']"""

The Eclipse scripting environment was used to develop the application with the scripting application programing interface (API) and direct data extraction from ARIA. For each institutional protocol, external validation was specified in a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that stores protocol specific constraints and evaluates compliance of the data from Eclipse and Aria. This tool was applied prospectively to a cohort of prostate cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy with a prescription regimen of 60 Gy in 20 fractions.  Results:   The prospective evaluation was performed on 58 prostate cancer patients. For this cohort, the mean (standard deviation) pass rate is 92.3% (6.1%). The overall fail rate is 6.0% (5.8%); the percentage of these failures is in 2.6% in Patient Assessment, 0% in Simulation, and 97.4% in Treatment Planning.  Conclusions:   A protocol compliance application is developed and implemented in a standard radiotherapy information system.

Some important critical issues regarding the PSA determination in the clinical framework are, however, still neglected in current guidelines and a major focus of recommendations on those aspects would be needed to improve their effectiveness.  Content:   Evidence sources in the available literature concerning the interchangeability of total PSA results measured with different commercial methods were critically appraised. We discuss how the heterogeneity of the measurand, the intermethod bias, and the design and selectivity of immunoassays may affect the diagnostic accuracy of selected PSA thresholds, and how knowledge of the analytical characteristics of assays in service, such as the recognized PSA circulating forms and the cross-reactivity with PSA homologs, is basic for improving both clinical decision-making in cancer screening and the reliability of the clinical interpretation of results at the individual level.  Summary:   Current CPGs ignore the poor interchangeability of PSA results obtained from different assays and the substantial role of laboratory issues in clinical performance of PSA testing. Involved stakeholders should contribute to fill the existing gap by: (a) preparing commutable reference materials for immunoassay calibration; (b) providing analytical characteristics that may explain the different performance of assays; (c) deriving outcome-based analytical performance specifications for PSA measurement; and (d) giving more focus on laboratory items when CPGs are prepared.""","""['Simona Ferraro', 'Marco Bussetti', 'Mauro Panteghini']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Clin Chem""","""['Prostate cancer screening: guidelines review and laboratory issues.', 'Early detection of prostate cancer by PSA testing: the results of a qualitative study on barriers caused by physicians in Austria implementing informed decision making.', 'Issues on standardization of immunoassays for prostate-specific antigen: a review.', 'Prostate cancer screening using prostate-specific antigen: The views of general and laboratory physicians.', 'An Automated Micro-Total Immunoassay System for Measuring Cancer-Associated α2,3-linked Sialyl N-Glycan-Carrying Prostate-Specific Antigen May Improve the Accuracy of Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Age- and Stage-Dependent Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness Associated with Differential Notch Signaling.', 'LncRNA/miRNA/mRNA Network Introduces Novel Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer.', 'Pattern of Radiotherapy Treatment in Low-Risk, Intermediate-Risk, and High-Risk Prostate Cancer Patients: Analysis of National Cancer Database.', 'Choosing which in-hospital laboratory tests to target for intervention: a scoping review.', 'Prognostic Value of Albumin to Globulin Ratio in Non-Metastatic and Metastatic Prostate Cancer Patients: A Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review.']"""

It remains unknown whether genetic variations in SLCOs contribute to the differences in prostate cancer aggressiveness in African Americans (AA) and European Americans (EA).  Methods:   SNPs in 11 SLCO members were selected, with addition of 139 potentially functional SNPs and 128 ancestry informative markers. A total of 1,045 SNPs were genotyped and analyzed in 993 AAs and 1,057 EAs from the North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project. Expression and cellular localization of SLCOs were examined using qRT-PCR, IHC, and in situ RNA hybridization in independent sets of prostate cancer cases.  Results:   Significant associations with prostate cancer characteristics were found for SNPs in SLCO2A1 and SLCO5A1. The associations differed by race (P interaction < 0.05). SNPs in SLCO2A1 were associated with reduced tumor aggressiveness and low Gleason score in AAs; whereas, SNPs in SLCO5A1 were associated with high clinical stage in EAs. In prostate tissue, SLCO2A1 and SLCO5A1 were the most expressed SLCOs at the mRNA level and were expressed predominantly in prostate endothelial and epithelial cells at the protein level, respectively.

Methods:   Preoperative bladder MRI was performed in 73 BCa patients. Two observers independently evaluated the MR blinded to histopathological data and classified the tumors according to VI-RADS criteria. Moreover, the quantitative parameters (maximum tumor diameter; Dmax, tumor contact length; TCL, and tumor apparent diffusion coefficient; ADC values) were independently measured by observers. The diagnostic performance of the VI-RADS score and quantitative values were evaluated by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Interobserver agreement was evaluated using the weighted-kappa coefficient (κ).  Results:   For the VI-RADS score, the AUC (area under the curve) was 0.968 and accuracy was 90.4% for Observer 1, and AUC was 0.953, accuracy was 89% for Observer 2. The AUC of TCL, TCL/DMax, and ADC values was 0.918, 0.675, and 0.832. In patients with a VI-RADS score ≥ 3, when a threshold value of TCL > 19.5 mm is used as complementary to the VI-RADS score, the accuracy of MRI for Observer-1 increases 100% and 97.26% for Observer-2. There was a good-excellent agreement between the observers in assessing the VI-RADS scores and quantitative parameters.  Conclusion:   Evaluation of bladder MRI using both VI-RADS criteria and TCL is successful and highly reproducible for detecting muscle layer invasion in patients with BCa.""","""['Ahmet Akcay', 'Ahmet Baki Yagci', 'Sinan Celen', 'Yusuf Ozlulerden', 'Nilay Sen Turk', 'Furkan Ufuk']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Clin Imaging""","""['Detecting Muscle Invasion of Bladder Cancer Using a Proposed Magnetic Resonance Imaging Strategy.', 'Clinical utility of the Vesical Imaging-Reporting and Data System for muscle-invasive bladder cancer between radiologists and urologists based on multiparametric MRI including 3D FSE T2-weighted acquisitions.', 'Multiparametric MRI in differentiation between muscle invasive and non-muscle invasive urinary bladder cancer with vesical imaging reporting and data system (VI-RADS) application.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Bladder Cancer: Development of VI-RADS (Vesical Imaging-Reporting And Data System).', 'Use of Vesical Imaging-Reporting and Data System (VI-RADS) for detecting the muscle invasion of bladder cancer: a diagnostic meta-analysis.', 'Tumor contact length with bladder wall provides effective risk stratification for lesions with a VIRADS score of 2-3.', 'Is high accuracy of Vesical Imaging-Reporting and Data System (VI-RADS) sufficient for its implementation in the urological practice?', 'Predicting muscle invasion in bladder cancer by deep learning analysis of MRI: comparison with vesical imaging-reporting and data system.', 'Inter-reader reliability of the vesical imaging-reporting and data system (VI-RADS) for muscle-invasive bladder cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Biparametric magnetic resonance imaging assessment for detection of muscle-invasive bladder cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Method:   The study was conducted with 30 patients in the intervention group (IG) and 30 patients in the control group (CG). Data were collected using a patient information form, CTCAE, EORTC QLQ-C30, and a follow-up form reporting weekly Kegel exercises. Before radiotherapy, the IG was provided with Kegel exercise training via visual training material; exercises were performed under the supervision of the researcher, and the exercise pamphlet was handed out. During radiotherapy, weekly follow-ups were performed by face-to-face contact or phone calls. No similar application was provided to the CG. CTCAE and EORTC QLQ-C30 were evaluated three times (baseline, 4th and 8th weeks of exercises).  Results:   At the end of the 4th week of exercises, 1st-grade urinary incontinence (UI) developed in the IG (10%) and in the CG (13.3%). At the end of the 8th week, 2nd-grade UI (3.3%) developed in the IG and 1st-grade (10%) and 2nd-grade UI (6.7%) developed in the CG. Fecal incontinence developed in neither group. At the end of the intervention, there was a significant improvement in Role, Social function and Global Health Status in the IG compared with the 4th week scores.

Methods and materials:   Between August 2008 and December 2017, patients with low- and intermediate risk PCa who received single dose or 2-fraction HDR BT, or 5-fraction SABR at a single institution were included. BCR for the whole population and the individual treatment groups were calculated using the Phoenix definition. Post treatment GI and GU toxicities were evaluated according to the CTCAE v4.0 guidelines.  Results:   185 patients with low- and intermediate risk PCa were included in this study with a median follow up of 60.5 months. BCRs at 3 and 5 years were 95% and 85% for all patients. The 5-year BCRs were 69%, 95% and 92% for the 19 Gy/1 fraction, 26 Gy/2 fractions and 36.25 Gy/5 fractions groups respectively. The cumulative 5-year incidence rates of ≥grade 2 GI events in the 19 Gy/1fr, 26 Gy/2fr and 36.25 Gy/5fr groups were 0%, 2% and 4%, respectively. Incidence rates in those treated in the 5-fraction SABR arm were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those treated in both HDR BT arms where no statistically significant difference between the two HDR BT groups was seen (p = 0.15). The cumulative 5-year incidence rates of ≥grade 2 GU events in the 19 Gy/1fr, 26 Gy/2fr and 36.25 Gy/5fr groups were 30%, 5% and 6%, respectively.

Materials and methods:   Complete data of 415 patients enrolled in a multi institute, prospective trial (#NCT02803086) treated with radical (31%), adjuvant (33%) and salvage (36%) intent at a median dose to pelvic nodes/lymph-nodal area of 53 Gy were available. The most severe changes between baseline and radiotherapy mid-point/end toxicity assessed by Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (only Bowel Domain) were considered (ΔIBDQ). The 25th percentile values of these score variations were set as endpoints. DVHs of bowel loops for patients with/without toxicity were compared for each endpoint, having excluded patients with baseline scores <5 (rate ranging between 2% and 7% according to the endpoint): the resulting best dosimetric predictors were combined with selected clinical parameters through multivariate logistic regression (MVA) to derive predictive models.  Results:   ΔIBDQ ranged between 0.2-1.5 points considering separately each IBDQ symptom. Only four symptoms (IBDQ1 = frequency, IBDQ5 = diarrhea, IBDQ17 = gas passage, IBDQ24 = urgency) showed a median worsening ≥ 1; DVH predicted the risk of worse symptoms for IBDQ5, IBDQ24 and overall Bowel Domain. At multivariable analysis DVHs (best cut-off: V46Gy ≥80 cc) and baseline scores (Odd-Ratio:0.35-0.65) were independently associated to the three end-points. The resulting models were reliable (H&L test: 0.453-0.956), well calibrated (calibration plot: slope = 0.922-1.069, R2 = 0.725-0.875) and moderately discriminative (Area Under the Curve:0.628-0.669).

Tumor-derived protein derived from Wnt5A gene (WNT5A) plays an important role in primary and metastatic PCa. Surrounding stroma cells also produce WNT5A, which may modulate the biology of PCa. Here, we assessed the role of stroma-derived WNT5A (stWNT5A) in primary PCa. A tissue microarray of samples obtained from 400 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy and control samples from 41 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) was immunohistochemically assessed for expression of stWNT5A. The cores were scored for staining intensity: 0 (no staining), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate), or 3 (strong) and the stained stromal surface area: 0 (0%), 1 (1-25%), 2 (26-50%), 3 (51-75%), or 4 (76-100%). Gleason Score (GS) and TNM-stage were assessed by stratifying the cohort into high-risk (≥ pT3, pN1, GS ≥ 8) and non-high-risk patients. Ki67 and TUNEL assays were performed to assess proliferation and apoptosis. Expression of stWNT5A in BPH and tumor-free control samples was 1.2-fold higher compared to tumor samples (P < 0.001). Non-high-risk patients had a higher stWNT5A score than high-risk patients (P < 0.05). stWNT5A expression was not correlated with overall and cancer-specific survival. Proliferation (r2 = 0.038, P < 0.001) and apoptosis (r2 = 0.277, P < 0.001) negatively correlated with stWNT5A expression. In summary, we show that expression of stWNT5A is higher in benign tissue and non-high-risk PCa. Stroma-derived Wnt signaling and tumor-derived Wnt may differentially impact on tumor behavior.

Methods:   The primary objective was to determine whether cancer patients were more likely to be chronic opioid users after diagnosis. We described prescription opioid use among U.S. older adult cancer patients during two time periods, within 2 years of diagnosis (short-term) and at least 2 years beyond diagnosis (long-term), compared to those without cancer (controls).

The objective of this study was to develop and validate a framework for differentiating Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System version 2 (PI-RADS v2) grades (grade 2 to grade 5) of PCa using texture features and machine learning (ML) methods with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). The study cohort included an MRI dataset of 59 patients with clinically proven PCa. Regions of interest (ROIs) for a total of 435 lesions were delineated from the segmented peripheral zones of DWI and ADC. Six texture methods comprising 98 texture features in total (49 each of DWI and ADC) were extracted from lesion ROIs. Random forest (RF) and correlation-based feature selection methods were applied on feature vectors to select the best features for classification.

However, the molecular mechanisms and exact role of mitochondrial proteases in cancer remain largely unexplored. Here, we identified functional crosstalk between LONP1 and ClpP, which are two mitochondrial matrix proteases that cooperate to attenuate proteotoxic stress and protect mitochondrial functions for cancer cell survival. LONP1 and ClpP genes closely localized on chromosome 19 and were co-expressed at high levels in most human cancers. Depletion of both genes synergistically attenuated cancer cell growth and induced cell death due to impaired mitochondrial functions and increased oxidative stress. Using mitochondrial matrix proteomic analysis with an engineered peroxidase (APEX)-mediated proximity biotinylation method, we identified the specific target substrates of these proteases, which were crucial components of mitochondrial functions, including oxidative phosphorylation, the TCA cycle, and amino acid and lipid metabolism. Furthermore, we found that LONP1 and ClpP shared many substrates, including serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2). Inhibition of both LONP1 and ClpP additively increased the amount of unfolded SHMT2 protein and enhanced sensitivity to SHMT2 inhibitor, resulting in significantly reduced cell growth and increased cell death under metabolic stress. Additionally, prostate cancer patients with higher LONP1 and ClpP expression exhibited poorer survival. These results suggest that interventions targeting the mitochondrial proteostasis network via LONP1 and ClpP could be potential therapeutic strategies for cancer.""","""['Yu Geon Lee#', 'Hui Won Kim#', 'Yeji Nam', 'Kyeong Jin Shin', 'Yu Jin Lee', 'Do Hong Park', 'Hyun-Woo Rhee', 'Jeong Kon Seo', 'Young Chan Chae']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Oncogenesis""","""['Global Proteome of LonP1+/- Mouse Embryonal Fibroblasts Reveals Impact on Respiratory Chain, but No Interdependence between Eral1 and Mitoribosomes.', 'LONP1 Is Required for Maturation of a Subset of Mitochondrial Proteins, and Its Loss Elicits an Integrated Stress Response.', 'Mitochondrial LonP1 protects cardiomyocytes from ischemia/reperfusion injury in vivo.', 'Cell stress management by the mitochondrial LonP1 protease - Insights into mitigating developmental, oncogenic and cardiac stress.', 'Mitochondrial Proteases as Emerging Pharmacological Targets.', 'The role of mitochondria in the resistance of melanoma to PD-1 inhibitors.', 'CLPP inhibition triggers apoptosis in human ovarian granulosa cells via COX5A abnormality-Mediated mitochondrial dysfunction.', 'The Role of Lonp1 on Mitochondrial Functions during Cardiovascular and Muscular Diseases.', 'Sirt3 restricts tumor initiation via promoting LONP1 deacetylation and K63 ubiquitination.', 'Maternal Western diet is associated with distinct preclinical pediatric NAFLD phenotypes in juvenile nonhuman primate offspring.']"""

NEPC is associated with molecular perturbation of several pathways, including amplification of MYCN. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma and other malignancies where it cooperates with N-Myc. We previously identified the first case of ALK F1174C-activating mutation in a patient with de novo NEPC who responded to the ALK inhibitor, alectinib. Here, we show that coactivation of ALK and N-Myc (ALK F1174C/N-Myc) is sufficient to transform mouse prostate basal stem cells into aggressive prostate cancer with neuroendocrine differentiation in a tissue recombination model. A novel gene signature from the ALK F1174C/N-Myc tumors was associated with poor outcome in multiple human prostate cancer datasets. ALK F1174C and ALK F1174C/N-Myc tumors displayed activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Chemical and genetic ALK inhibition suppressed Wnt/β-catenin signaling and tumor growth in vitro in NEPC and neuroblastoma cells. ALK inhibition cooperated with Wnt inhibition to suppress NEPC and neuroblastoma proliferation in vitro and tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. These findings point to a role for ALK signaling in NEPC and the potential of cotargeting the ALK and Wnt/β-catenin pathways in ALK-driven tumors. Activated ALK and N-Myc are well known drivers in neuroblastoma development, suggesting potential similarities and opportunities to elucidate mechanisms and therapeutic targets in NEPC and vice versa.

Identification of new biomarkers representing intrinsic features of malignant transformation and development of prognostic imaging technologies are critical for improving treatment decisions and patient survival. In this study, we analyzed radical prostatectomy specimens from 422 patients with localized disease to define the expression pattern of methionine aminopeptidase II (MetAP2), a cytosolic metalloprotease that has been identified as a druggable target in cancer. MetAP2 was highly expressed in 54% of low-grade and 59% of high-grade cancers. Elevated levels of MetAP2 at diagnosis were associated with shorter time to recurrence. Controlled self-assembly of a synthetic small molecule enabled design of the first MetAP2-activated PET imaging tracer for monitoring MetAP2 activity in vivo. The nanoparticles assembled upon MetAP2 activation were imaged in single prostate cancer cells with post-click fluorescence labeling. The fluorine-18-labeled tracers successfully differentiated MetAP2 activity in both MetAP2-knockdown and inhibitor-treated human prostate cancer xenografts by micro-PET/CT scanning. This highly sensitive imaging technology may provide a new tool for noninvasive early-risk stratification of prostate cancer and monitoring the therapeutic effect of MetAP2 inhibitors as anticancer drugs.

We tested the hypothesis that CAFs develop unique characteristics that enhance their resistance to ionizing radiation.  Methods:   CAFs were generated through intimate coculture of normal human fibroblasts of skin or lung origin with various human cancer cell types using permeable microporous membrane inserts. Fibroblasts and cancer cells are grown intimately, yet separately, on either side of the insert's membrane for extended times to generate activated fibroblast populations highly enriched in CAFs.  Results:   The generated CAFs exhibited a decrease in Caveolin-1 protein expression levels, a CAF biomarker, which was further enhanced when the coculture was maintained under in-vivo-like oxygen tension conditions. The level of p21Waf1 was also attenuated, a characteristic also associated with accelerated tumor growth. Furthermore, the generated CAFs experienced perturbations in their redox environment as demonstrated by increases in protein carbonylation, mitochondrial superoxide anion levels, and modulation of the activity of the antioxidants, manganese superoxide dismutase and catalase. Propagation of the isolated CAFs for 25 population doublings was associated with enhanced genomic instability and a decrease in expression of the senescence markers β-galactosidase and p16INK4a. With relevance to radiotherapeutic treatments, CAFs in coculture with cancer cells of diverse origins (breast, brain, lung, and prostate) were resistant to the clastogenic effects of 137Cs γ rays compared to naïve fibroblasts. Addition of repair inhibitors of single- or double-stranded DNA breaks attenuated the resistance of CAFs to the clastogenic effects of γ rays, supporting a role for increased ability to repair DNA damage in CAF radioresistance.  Conclusions:   This study reveals that CAFs are radioresistant and experience significant changes in indices of oxidative metabolism. The CAFs that survive radiation treatment likely modulate the fate of the associated cancer cells. Identifying them together with their mode of communication with cancer cells, and eradicating them, particularly when they may exist at the margin of the radiotherapy planning target volume, may improve the efficacy of cancer treatments.

Methods:   Fifty patients were prospectively enrolled and randomly classified into the non-ITMB (n = 25) and ITMB (n = 25) groups. The ITMB therapeutic regimen consisted of 0.2 mg morphine and 7.5 mg bupivacaine (total 1.7 mL). All patients were routinely administered the intravenous patient-controlled analgesia and appropriately treated with rescue intravenous (IV) opioid drugs, based on the discretion of the attending physicians who were blinded to the group assignments. Cumulative IV opioid consumption and the numeric rating scale (NRS) score were assessed at 1, 6, and 24 h postoperatively, and opioid-related complications were measured during the day after surgery.  Results:   Demographic findings were comparable between patients who did and did not receive ITMB. The intraoperative dose of remifentanil was lower in the ITMB group than in the non-ITMB group. Pain scores (i.e., NRS) at rest and during coughing as well as cumulative IV opioid consumption were significantly lower in patients who received ITMB than in those who did not in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU; i.e., at 1 h after surgery) and the ward (i.e., at 6 and 24 h after surgery). ITMB was significantly associated with postoperative NRS scores of ≤ 3 at rest and during coughing in the PACU (i.e., at 1 h after surgery) before and after adjusting for cumulative IV opioid consumption. In the ward (i.e., at 6 and 24 h after surgery), ITMB was associated with postoperative NRS scores of ≤ 3 at rest and during coughing before adjusting for cumulative IV opioid consumption but not after.

This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of enzalutamide (an antiandrogen) monotherapy with RT for the treatment of intermediate-risk prostate cancer.  Methods and materials:   This trial was an open-label, phase 2 study of 6 months of enzalutamide monotherapy with external beam RT for intermediate-risk prostate cancer. Enzalutamide was initiated 2 months before external beam RT. The primary endpoint was prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response measured at the end of enzalutamide administration at the 6-month timepoint. Secondary endpoints included assessment of toxicity and changes in anthropomorphic body measurement, sexual function, and metabolism. The sample size was 64 patients. The hypothesis was that if ≥60% of the patients did not achieve a PSA nadir of ≤0.2 ng/mL, the study results would be deemed negative.  Results:   The results met the prespecified endpoint for efficacy in that PSA values ≤0.2 ng/mL were observed in 49 of 64 patients (77%), and 60 of 64 patients (94%) had PSA values ≤0.5ng/mL. The most frequent adverse events were hypertension and gynecomastia. There were no changes in anthropomorphic body measurements and only modest erectile dysfunction.

Conclusion:   Nivolumab plus ipilimumab demonstrated only modest activity in patients with AR-V7-expressing prostate cancer, and was not sufficient to justify further exploration in unselected patients. Stratification by baseline alkaline phosphatase and cytokines (IL-6, -7, and -17) may be prognostic for outcomes to immunotherapy.""","""['Eugene Shenderov', 'Karim Boudadi', 'Wei Fu', 'Hao Wang', 'Rana Sullivan', 'Alice Jordan', 'Donna Dowling', 'Rana Harb', 'Joseph Schonhoft', 'Adam Jendrisak', 'Michael A Carducci', 'Mario A Eisenberger', 'James R Eshleman', 'Jun Luo', 'Charles G Drake', 'Drew M Pardoll', 'Emmanuel S Antonarakis']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 and Efficacy of Taxane Chemotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'AR-V7 in Peripheral Whole Blood of Patients with Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Association with Treatment-specific Outcome Under Abiraterone and Enzalutamide.', 'Improved Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 Detection Using a Highly Sensitive Assay to Predict Resistance to Abiraterone or Enzalutamide in Metastatic Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Enzalutamide for the treatment of nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'ARV-7: A biomarker for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'An unbiased seed-based RNAi selection screen identifies small RNAs that inhibit androgen signaling and prostate cancer cell growth.', 'Endostar (rh-endostatin) consolidation therapy after sequential chemoradiotherapy in stage III, unresectable lung adenocarcinoma with novel STK11, TP53 and ATM mutations: a case report.', 'Recent Research Advances in Double-Strand Break and Mismatch Repair Defects in Prostate Cancer and Potential Clinical Applications.', 'Ibrutinib Inhibits BTK Signaling in Tumor-Infiltrated B Cells and Amplifies Antitumor Immunity by PD-1 Checkpoint Blockade for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Using the AR-V7 biomarker to determine treatment in metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer, a feasibility randomised control trial, conclusions from the VARIANT trial version 2; peer review: 2 approved.']"""

Besides, the resistance mechanisms linked to prostate cancer treatment remain unclear. Liquid biopsies represent the most promising alternative due to the complexity of biopsying bone metastasis and the duration of the disease. We performed a prospective longitudinal study in CTCs from 20 castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with docetaxel. For that, we used CellSearch® technology and a custom gene expression panel with qRT-PCR using a CTCs negative enrichment approach. We found that CTCs showed a hybrid phenotype during the disease, where epithelial features were associated with the presence of ≥ 5 CTCs/7.5 mL of blood, while high relative expression of the gene MYCL was observed preferentially in the set of samples with < 5 CTCs/7.5 mL of blood. At baseline, patients whose CTCs had stem or hybrid features showed a later progression. After 1 cycle of docetaxel, high relative expression of ZEB1 indicated worse outcome, while KRT19 and KLK3 high expression could predisposed the patients to a worse prognosis at clinical progression. In the present work we describe biomarkers with clinical relevance for the prediction of early response or resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients. Besides, we question the utility of targeted isolated CTCs and the use of a limited number of markers to define the CTCs population.""","""['Thais Pereira-Veiga', 'Miriam González-Conde', 'Luis León-Mateos', 'Roberto Piñeiro-Cid', 'Carmen Abuín', 'Laura Muinelo-Romay', 'Mónica Martínez-Fernández', 'Jenifer Brea Iglesias', 'Jorge García González', 'Urbano Anido', 'Santiago Aguín-Losada', 'Víctor Cebey', 'Clotilde Costa', 'Rafael López-López']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Clin Exp Metastasis""","""['Phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of tumor tissue and circulating tumor cells in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: A report from the PETRUS prospective study.', 'Phenotypes of circulating tumour cells predict time to castration resistance in metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Status in Circulating Tumor Cells as a Predictive Biomarker of Sensitivity in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with Docetaxel Chemotherapy.', 'The use of circulating tumor cells in guiding treatment decisions for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Clinical Utility of Circulating Tumor Cells in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Transcriptome Profiling of Circulating Tumor Cells to Predict Clinical Outcomes in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', ""Extracellular Vesicles' Genetic Cargo as Noninvasive Biomarkers in Cancer: A Pilot Study Using ExoGAG Technology."", 'The roles of proteases in prostate cancer.', 'A Systematic Review of Circulating Tumor Cells Clinical Application in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Circulating tumor cell gene expression and plasma AR gene copy number as biomarkers for castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with cabazitaxel.']"""

Purpose:   This study compared different deep learning methods for whole-gland and zonal prostate segmentation.  Study type:   Retrospective.  Population:   A total of 204 patients (train/test = 99/105) from the PROSTATEx public dataset.  Field strength/sequence:   A 3 T, TSE T2 -weighted.  Assessment:   Four operators performed manual segmentation of the whole-gland, central zone + anterior stroma + transition zone (TZ), and peripheral zone (PZ). U-net, efficient neural network (ENet), and efficient residual factorized ConvNet (ERFNet) were trained and tuned on the training data through 5-fold cross-validation to segment the whole gland and TZ separately, while PZ automated masks were obtained by the subtraction of the first two.  Statistical tests:   Networks were evaluated on the test set using various accuracy metrics, including the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). Model DSC was compared in both the training and test sets using the analysis of variance test (ANOVA) and post hoc tests. Parameter number, disk size, training, and inference times determined network computational complexity and were also used to assess the model performance differences. A P < 0.05 was selected to indicate the statistical significance.  Results:   The best DSC (P < 0.05) in the test set was achieved by ENet: 91% ± 4% for the whole gland, 87% ± 5% for the TZ, and 71% ± 8% for the PZ. U-net and ERFNet obtained, respectively, 88% ± 6% and 87% ± 6% for the whole gland, 86% ± 7% and 84% ± 7% for the TZ, and 70% ± 8% and 65 ± 8% for the PZ. Training and inference time were lowest for ENet.  Data conclusion:   Deep learning networks can accurately segment the prostate using T2 -weighted images.

Our study aimed to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on the short-term survival of cancer patients by comparing a period of 4 months after the outbreak began (2 March 2020) with an equal period from 2019. All cancer cases of the esophagus, stomach, colon and rectum, pancreas, lung, skin-melanoma, breast, cervix, and prostate, from the Portuguese Oncology Institute of Porto (IPO-Porto) and diagnosed between 2 March and 1 July of 2019 (before COVID-19) and 2020 (after COVID-19) were identified. Information regarding sociodemographic, clinical and treatment characteristics were collected from the cancer registry database and clinical files. Vital status was assessed to 31 October of the respective years. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate crude and propensity score-adjusted hazards ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of death. During follow-up to 31 October, there were 154 (11.8%) deaths observed before COVID-19 and 131 (17.2%) after COVID-19, corresponding to crude and adjusted HRs (95% CI) of 1.51 (1.20-1.91) and 1.10 (0.86-1.40), respectively. Significantly higher adjusted hazards of death were observed for patients with Stage III cancer (HR = 2.37; 95% CI: 1.14-4.94) and those undergoing surgical treatment (HR = 3.97; 95% CI: 1.14-13.77) or receiving radiotherapy (HR = 1.96; 95% CI: 1.96-3.74), while patients who did not receive any treatment had a lower mortality hazards (HR = 0.62; 95% CI: 0.46-0.83).

The analysis was adjusted for age, screening trial arm, and other drugs in use, including statins, antidiabetic drugs, antihypertensive drugs, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Compared to the nonusers of AEDs, overall PCa risk was decreased among AED users (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.76-0.96). A similar PCa risk decrease was observed among users of HDACi AEDs (HR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.76-1.01), but no risk difference was found when comparing HDACi AED users to users of other AEDs (HR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.76-1.27).

Since then, this topic has received increasing attention, and many scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Thus, it is important to formulate on a regular basis updated guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Despite numerous reviews, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to evaluate autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we present a set of guidelines for investigators to select and interpret methods to examine autophagy and related processes, and for reviewers to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of reports that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a dogmatic set of rules, because the appropriateness of any assay largely depends on the question being asked and the system being used. Moreover, no individual assay is perfect for every situation, calling for the use of multiple techniques to properly monitor autophagy in each experimental setting. Finally, several core components of the autophagy machinery have been implicated in distinct autophagic processes (canonical and noncanonical autophagy), implying that genetic approaches to block autophagy should rely on targeting two or more autophagy-related genes that ideally participate in distinct steps of the pathway. Along similar lines, because multiple proteins involved in autophagy also regulate other cellular pathways including apoptosis, not all of them can be used as a specific marker for bona fide autophagic responses. Here, we critically discuss current methods of assessing autophagy and the information they can, or cannot, provide. Our ultimate goal is to encourage intellectual and technical innovation in the field.""","""['Daniel J Klionsky', 'Amal Kamal Abdel-Aziz', 'Sara Abdelfatah', 'Mahmoud Abdellatif', 'Asghar Abdoli',

Materials and Methods: A Markov model with three health states: progression-free survival (PFS), progressive disease (PD), and death, was constructed. All patients were assumed to enter the model in the PFS state and transit according to the transition structure. Efficacy data were derived from the ENZAMET trial and Weibull distribution curves were modeled to fit the survival curves. Costs in the model included cost of drugs, best-supportive care (BSC), follow-up, tests, and adverse events (AEs)-related treatments. The primary endpoint of the study was incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). In addition, the impact of several key parameters on the results of the cost-effectiveness analysis was tested with one-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: Overall, ICERs were $430,933.95/QALY and $225,444.74/QALY of addition of enzalutamide to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) vs. ADT from the US and Chinese payers' perspective, respectively.

This study focused on evaluating the application of a novel nanobubble ultrasound contrast agent targeted to the prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA-targeted NBs) in ultrasound imaging of prostate cancer (PCa) in vivo using a clinically relevant orthotopic tumor model in nude mice. Our results demonstrated that PSMA-targeted NBs had increased extravasation and retention in PSMA-expressing orthotopic mouse tumors.

Using public databases, we have identified a prostate cancer susceptibility SNP at an intronic enhancer of the neural precursor expressed, developmentally downregulated 9 (NEDD9) gene, which is strongly associated with increased risk of patients with African ancestry. This genetic variation increased expression of NEDD9 by modulating the chromatin binding of certain transcription factors, including ERG and NANOG. Moreover, NEDD9 displayed oncogenic activity in prostate cancer cells, promoting prostate cancer tumor growth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Together, our study provides novel insights into the genetic mechanisms driving prostate cancer racial disparities.

TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) is an anticancer agent that is selectively cytotoxic to cancer cells; however, many human cancers are resistant to TRAIL. In this study, we sensitized androgen-independent and TRAIL-resistant prostate cancer cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis via taxane therapy and examined the mechanism of sensitization. DU145 and PC3 cells displayed no significant reduction in cell viability when treated with soluble TRAIL, docetaxel, or cabazitaxel alone indicating that both cell lines are resistant to TRAIL and taxanes individually. Taxane and TRAIL combination synergistically amplified apoptosis strongly suggesting that taxanes sensitize prostate cancer cells to TRAIL. A Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) inhibitor inhibited apoptosis in treated cells and significantly reduced death receptor expression indicating JNK activation by ER stress sensitizes PCa cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by upregulating DR4/DR5 expression. In addition, suppression of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) reduced TRAIL sensitization in both cell lines indicating that ER stress-related apoptosis is mediated, in part, by CHOP. Cytochrome c knockdown showed a significant decrease in sensitivity in PC3 cells, but not in Bax-deficient DU145 cells. A computational model was used to simulate apoptosis for cells treated with taxane and TRAIL therapy as demonstrated in in vitro experiments. Pretreatment with taxanes sensitized cells to apoptosis induced by TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, demonstrating that combining TRAIL with ER stress inducers is a promising therapy to reverse TRAIL resistance to treat mCRPC.""","""['Korie A Grayson', 'Jacob M Hope', 'Wenjun Wang', 'Cynthia A Reinhart-King', 'Michael R King']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Overcoming TRAIL-resistance by sensitizing prostate cancer 3D spheroids with taxanes.', 'Cyproterone acetate enhances TRAIL-induced androgen-independent prostate cancer cell apoptosis via up-regulation of death receptor 5.', 'Quercetin enhances apoptotic effect of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in ovarian cancer cells through reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated CCAAT enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP)-death receptor 5 pathway.', 'Utilization of the cellular stress response to sensitize cancer cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.', 'Taxane-based Combination Therapies for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Chemical Activation and Mechanical Sensitization of Piezo1 Enhance TRAIL-Mediated Apoptosis in Glioblastoma Cells.', 'Docetaxel Enhances Tumor Necrosis Factor-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand-Mediated Apoptosis in Prostate Cancer Cells via Epigenetic Gene Regulation by Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2.', 'A novel signature based on pyroptosis-related genes for predicting prognosis and treatment response in prostate cancer patients.', 'The endoplasmic reticulum stress response in prostate cancer.', 'Harnessing TRAIL-Induced Apoptosis Pathway for Cancer Immunotherapy and Associated Challenges.']"""

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of prior cancer and assess its impact on survival of patients diagnosed with gastric cancer.  Methods:   Patients with gastric cancer as the primary or second primary malignancies diagnosed from 2004 to 2010 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Propensity score matching (PSM) was conducted to balance baseline characteristics. Kaplan-Meier method, multivariate Cox proportional hazard model, and multivariate competing risk model were performed for survival analysis.  Results:   A total of 28,795 eligible patients with gastric cancer were included, of whom 2695 (9.35%) had a history of prior cancer. Prostate (35%), breast (12%), colon (8%), and urinary bladder (7%) malignancies were the most common prior cancer types. Patients with prior cancer history had slightly inferior overall survival (AHR = 1.06; 95% CI [1.00-1.12]; P = 0.043) but superior gastric cancer-specific survival (AHR = 0.82; 95% CI [0.76-0.88]; P < 0.001) compared with those without prior cancer. The subgroup analysis determined that a prior cancer history did not adversely affect gastric patients' clinical outcomes, except in those with prior cancer diagnosed within one year, at distant stage, or originating from lung and bronchus.

Patients and methods:   Patients with PSA level of 4 to 10 ng/mL were prospectively enrolled and underwent transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy. Patient information was collected, and logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the predictive factors of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa).

Results:   Among 222 patients, 121 were diagnosed with PCa and 92 had csPCa. Age, prostate volume, PSA density, location (peripheral zone, csPCa only), and PI-RADS v2.1 score were correlated with PCa and csPCa, and PI-RADS v2.1 score was the best predictor. A PI-RADS v2.1 score of 4 was the best cutoff value for predicting csPCa in patients with lesions only in the transitional zone with respect to the Youden index (0.5896) and negative predictive value (93.10%) with acceptable sensitivity (81.82%) and specificity (77.14%).

We hypothesized that patients with DNCR in the early postoperative period would report reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and more cognitive failures 12 months after surgery, compared with patients without DNCR.  Methods:   We performed a 12-month follow-up on 367 patients who had been enrolled in a prospective observational trial to study the incidence of DNCR after radical prostatectomy. Patients were screened for preoperative cognitive impairment and depression. We defined DNCR as a decline in cognitive function between days 3 and 5 after surgery, compared with baseline assessments. We evaluated HRQoL and cognitive failures 12 months after surgery with the 36-item Short Form Health Survey and the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire. General linear models were used to analyze associations of DNCR with HRQoL and cognitive failures.  Results:   Delayed neurocognitive recovery in the early postoperative period was significantly associated with self-reported cognitive failures (B for no DNCR = - 0.411 [95% CI: - 0.798;0.024], p = 0.038), but not with physical (B = 0.082 [95% CI: - 0.021;0.186], p = 0.118) or mental HRQoL (B = - 0.044 [95% CI: - 0.149;0.062], p = 0.417) 12 months after surgery. Preoperative depression screening scores were significantly associated with self-reported cognitive failures and both physical and mental HRQoL 12 months after surgery.  Conclusions:   Delayed neurocognitive recovery in the early period after radical prostatectomy has a long-term impact on patients' daily lives by impairing memory, attention, action, and perception. Therefore, prevention of DNCR must be a priority for physicians and researchers. Consequent preoperative screening for depressive symptoms may facilitate early psycho-oncological intervention to improve postoperative HRQoL.

Data from Piedmont/Valle d'Aosta Oncological Network, Italy""","""Introduction:   Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has dramatically hit all Europe and Northern Italy in particular. The reallocation of medical resources has caused a sharp reduction in the activity of many medical disciplines, including urology. The restricted availability of resources is expected to cause a delay in the treatment of urological cancers and to negatively influence the clinical history of many cancer patients. In this study, we describe COVID-19 impact on uro-oncological management in Piedmont/Valle d'Aosta, estimating its future impact.  Methods:   We performed an online survey in 12 urological centers, belonging to the Oncological Network of Piedmont/Valle d'Aosta, to estimate the impact of COVID-19 emergency on their practice. On this basis, we then estimated the medical working capacity needed to absorb all postponed uro-oncological procedures.  Results:   Most centers (77%) declared to be ""much""/""very much"" affected by COVID-19 emergency. If uro-oncological consultations for newly diagnosed cancers were often maintained, follow-up consultations were more than halved or even suspended in around two out of three centers. In-office and day-hospital procedures were generally only mildly reduced, whereas major uro-oncological procedures were more than halved or even suspended in 60% of centers. To clear waiting list backlog, the urological working capacity should dramatically increase in the next months; delays greater than 1 month are expected for more than 50% of uro-oncological procedures.  Conclusions:   COVID-19 emergency has dramatically slowed down uro-oncological activity in Piedmont and Valle d'Aosta. Ideally, uro-oncological patients should be referred to COVID-19-free tertiary urological centers to ensure a timely management.""","""['Marco Oderda', 'Giorgio Calleris', 'Marco Falcone', 'Giuseppe Fasolis', 'Giovanni Muto', 'Gianluca Oderda', 'Francesco Porpiglia', 'Alessandro Volpe', 'Oscar Bertetto', 'Paolo Gontero']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Urologia""","""['Forecasting the Future of Urology Practice: A Comprehensive Review of the Recommendations by International and European Associations on Priority Procedures During the COVID-19 Pandemic.', 'Global change of surgical and oncological clinical practice in urology during early COVID-19 pandemic.', 'Assessing the Burden of Nondeferrable Major Uro-oncologic Surgery to Guide Prioritisation Strategies During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Insights from Three Italian High-volume Referral Centres.', 'A Global Survey on the Impact of COVID-19 on Urological Services.', 'Impact of COVID-19 outbreak on urology surgical waiting lists and waiting lists prioritization strategies in the Post-COVID-19 era.', 'The Impact of COVID-19 on New Kidney Cancer Diagnosis: Stage and Treatment in Northern Italy.', 'The delay in the diagnosis and treatment of newly diagnosed bladder cancer patients during COVID 19 pandemic.', 'How Does the COVID-19 Pandemic Influence Histopathological Outcomes for Urologic Cancers?', 'Impact of COVID-19 on male urogenital health: Success of vaccines.', 'Changes in the quality of cancer care as assessed through performance indicators during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020: a scoping review.']"""

Although tPSA and fPSA are measured on a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved platform, the performance of the iPSA and hK2 assays in the clinical setting has not previously been reported.  Methods:   Analytical performance was determined for the iPSA and hK2 assays in both serum and EDTA plasma, according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Equivalence of the 4Kscore in both sample matrices was demonstrated in a 353-patient clinical cohort, and the stability of endogenous iPSA and hK2 for at least 3 days was demonstrated in a smaller subset.  Results:   Intralaboratory and interlaboratory precision of the iPSA and hK2 assays in both matrices was comparable with that of FDA-approved tPSA and fPSA assays (<18% for iPSA; <8% for hK2). The picogram per milliliter sensitivity and wide dynamic range of the iPSA and hK2 assays allowed for accurate measurements in the target population.

Segmenting breast regions accurately from ultrasound image is a challenging task due to the inherent speckle artifacts, blurry breast lesion boundaries, and inhomogeneous intensity distributions inside the breast lesion regions. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated remarkable results in medical image segmentation tasks. However, the convolutional operations in a CNN often focus on local regions, which suffer from limited capabilities in capturing long-range dependencies of the input ultrasound image, resulting in degraded breast lesion segmentation accuracy. In this paper, we develop a deep convolutional neural network equipped with a global guidance block (GGB) and breast lesion boundary detection (BD) modules for boosting the breast ultrasound lesion segmentation. The GGB utilizes the multi-layer integrated feature map as a guidance information to learn the long-range non-local dependencies from both spatial and channel domains. The BD modules learn additional breast lesion boundary map to enhance the boundary quality of a segmentation result refinement. Experimental results on a public dataset and a collected dataset show that our network outperforms other medical image segmentation methods and the recent semantic segmentation methods on breast ultrasound lesion segmentation. Moreover, we also show the application of our network on the ultrasound prostate segmentation, in which our method better identifies prostate regions than state-of-the-art networks.""","""['Cheng Xue', 'Lei Zhu', 'Huazhu Fu', 'Xiaowei Hu', 'Xiaomeng Li', 'Hai Zhang', 'Pheng-Ann Heng']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Image Anal""","""['C-Net: Cascaded convolutional neural network with global guidance and refinement residuals for breast ultrasound images segmentation.', 'HCTNet: A hybrid CNN-transformer network for breast ultrasound image segmentation.', 'Breast ultrasound image segmentation: A coarse-to-fine fusion convolutional neural network.', 'Breast ultrasound image segmentation: a survey.', 'Automated breast tumor detection and segmentation with a novel computational framework of whole ultrasound images.', 'A hybrid attentional guidance network for tumors segmentation of breast ultrasound images.', 'Prognostic Prediction of Cancer Based on Radiomics Features of Diagnostic Imaging: The Performance of Machine Learning Strategies.', 'BIoMT-ISeg: Blockchain internet of medical things for intelligent segmentation.', 'A multi-task convolutional neural network for classification and segmentation of chronic venous disorders.', 'Novel automated spinal ultrasound segmentation approach for scoliosis visualization.']"""

However, ORs are also found in other non-nasal tissues, but the role of these ectopic ORs in cell signaling, proliferation, and survival is not well understood. Here, using an inducible expression system in the lymph node carcinoma of the prostate (LNCaP) cell line, we investigated two ectopic ORs, OR51E1 and OR51E2, which have been shown to be upregulated in prostate cancer. We found that, consistent with previous studies, OR51E1 stimulated adenylyl cyclase in response to treatment by short-chain to medium-chain organic acids (C3-C9) but not by acetate. OR51E2 responded to acetate and propionate but not to the longer chain organic acids. Stimulation of LNCaP cells with butyrate inhibited their growth, and the knockdown of the endogenous OR51E1 negated this cytostatic effect. Most significantly, overexpression of OR51E1 or OR51E2 suppressed LNCaP cell proliferation. Overexpression of another ectopic OR OR2AT4, β2-adrenergic receptor, or treatment of cells with forskolin did not suppress cell proliferation, indicating that a rise in cAMP is not sufficient to induce cytostasis. Overexpression of OR51E1 caused an upregulation of cytostatic and cell death markers including p27, p21, and p53, strongly increased annexin V staining, and stimulated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2. Overexpression and/or activation of OR51E1 did not affect human embryonic kidney 293 cell proliferation, indicating that cytotoxicity of OR51E1/OR51E2 is specific for LNCaP cells.

We identified NKX3.1 positive nuclear staining in 9 of 12 individual patients of MC (n=20 of 25 samples when taking into account separate episodes). Four of the five negative specimens had been previously subjected to acid-based decalcification. NKX3.1 was negative in 536 samples from 16 non-MC sarcomas derived from largely tissue microarrays (TMAs). Overall, we identified 80% sensitivity and 100% specificity for NKX3.1 IHC in MCs. The sensitivity increased to 95.2% when acid-based decalcified specimens were excluded from the analysis. No correlation between NKX3.1 expression and AR IHC was identified. In summary, our findings indicate that NKX3.1 nuclear positivity is highly sensitive and specific for MC, provided that ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-based rather than acid-based decalcification is used for sample processing. NKX3.1 IHC in the right clinical and histopathological setting can potentially be sufficient for the diagnosis of MC, reserving molecular confirmation only for equivocal cases.""","""['Nimeka Ramanayake', 'Ana Cristina Vargas', 'Joel Talbot', 'Fiona Bonar', 'Daniel D Wong', 'David Wong', 'Annabelle Mahar', 'Rooshdiya Karim', 'Peter P Luk', 'Christina Selinger', 'Loretta Sioson', 'Anthony J Gill', 'Fiona Maclean']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Pathology""","""['NKX3.1 immunoreactivity is not identified in mesenchymal chondrosarcoma: a 25-case cohort study.', 'NKX3.1 a useful marker for mesenchymal chondrosarcoma: An immunohistochemical study.', 'NKX3-1 Is a Useful Immunohistochemical Marker of EWSR1-NFATC2 Sarcoma and Mesenchymal Chondrosarcoma.', 'Mesenchymal Chondrosarcoma: a Review with Emphasis on its Fusion-Driven Biology.', 'Best practices recommendations in the application of immunohistochemistry in the prostate: report from the International Society of Urologic Pathology consensus conference.', 'Ewing and Ewing-like sarcomas: A morphological guide through genetically-defined entities.', 'Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma: An Australian multi-centre cohort study.']"""

Methods:   We conducted a retrospective cohort study among patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in a multi-hospital, academic medical institution in New York City. Outcomes included mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and AKI among hospitalized patients. We also evaluated risk of hospitalization among all patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multilevel logistic regression models were used for analysis.  Results:   We identified 6,893 patients who met inclusion criteria, of which 4,018 were hospitalized. Among hospitalized patients 374 (9%) had a history of cancer, 281 (7%) experienced AKI, and 1,045 (26%) died. In adjusted analyses, patients with a history of cancer had 1.33 (95% CI = 1.05, 1.69) times the odds of death compared to those without cancer and this appeared to be driven by lung cancer (odds ratio (OR) = 2.44, 95% CI= 1.05, 4.39). Patients with a history of genitourinary cancer were not at higher risk of mortality compared to those without cancer (OR=0.99, 95% CI= 0.61, 1.62). History of cancer was not associated with ICU admission or AKI in overall and subgroup analyses.  Conclusions:   Patients with a history of cancer who are hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection are not at greater risk for AKI, though they are at higher risk for mortality as compared to patients without a history of cancer. The increased risk in mortality appears driven by patients with pulmonary neoplasms. Patients with a history of genitourinary malignancies do not appear to be at higher risk for AKI or for mortality compared to the general population.""","""['Johnathan A Khusid', 'Adan Z Becerra', 'Blair Gallante', 'Areeba S Sadiq', 'William M Atallah', 'Ketan K Badani', 'Mantu Gupta']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Outcomes Among Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19 and Acute Kidney Injury.', 'The Risk Factors and Clinical Outcomes Associated with Acute Kidney Injury in Patients with COVID-19: Data from a Large Cohort in Iran.', 'Association of SARS-CoV-2 viral load at admission with in-hospital acute kidney injury: A retrospective cohort study.', 'Relationship Between Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the Etiology of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI).', 'COVID-19 and acute kidney injury.', 'Patients with advanced pancreatic and biliary cancer appear vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant: An observational study during the COVID-19 outbreak in Shanghai.', 'COVID-19 and Lung Cancer Survival: An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Kidney health in the COVID-19 pandemic: An umbrella review of meta-analyses and systematic reviews.', 'Acute kidney injury outcomes in covid-19 patients: systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""
