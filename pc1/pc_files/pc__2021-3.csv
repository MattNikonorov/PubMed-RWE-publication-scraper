Methods:   Patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in our department from 2010 to 2019 were included. For penile rehabilitation, a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (tadalafil 20 mg) was administered twice a week for 1-6 months postoperatively. The International Index of Erectile Function questionnaire (question 1 and erectile function domain) and the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite questionnaire (sexual function) were used.  Results:   After propensity score matching, there were 79 patients in the penile rehabilitation group and 79 patients in the non-penile rehabilitation group. There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics between the two groups. Significantly higher scores were seen in the penile rehabilitation group compared with the non-penile rehabilitation group at postoperative 3, 6 and 9 months in the International Index of Erectile Function questionnaire-question 1, at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months in erectile function domain, and at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months in Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite questionnaire sexual function (P < 0.05). There were significant improvements in the erectile recovery rate in the penile rehabilitation group compared with the non-penile rehabilitation group in the nerve sparing (P = 0.006) and partial nerve sparing (P = 0.037) groups.  Conclusions:   The present findings suggest that robot-assisted radical prostatectomy patients who undergo not only nerve sparing, but also those who undergo patial nerve sparing could benefit from penile rehabilitation using a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor.""","""['Yusuke Kimura', 'Masashi Honda', 'Shogo Teraoka', 'Tetsuya Yumioka', 'Hideto Iwamoto', 'Shuichi Morizane', 'Katsuya Hikita', 'Atsushi Takenaka']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment from Dr Hinata to Impact of penile rehabilitation with phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors on recovery of erectile function in patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: A propensity score-matched analysis.', 'Editorial Comment from Dr Matsushita to Impact of penile rehabilitation with phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors on recovery of erectile function in patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: A propensity score-matched analysis.', 'Optimal strategy for penile rehabilitation after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy based on preoperative erectile function.', 'Exploratory Decision-Tree Modeling of Data from the Randomized REACTT Trial of Tadalafil Versus Placebo to Predict Recovery of Erectile Function After Bilateral Nerve-Sparing Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Editorial Comment from Dr Matsushita to Impact of penile rehabilitation with phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors on recovery of erectile function in patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: A propensity score-matched analysis.', 'Optimization of sexual function outcome after radical prostatectomy using phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors.', 'Penile Rehabilitation Therapy Following Radical Prostatectomy: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Advances in Nanoparticle Delivery System for Erectile Dysfunction: An Updated Review.']"""

We sought to comprehensively assess aggregate trial-level performance of commonly reported intermediate clinical endpoints across all randomised trials in localised prostate cancer.  Methods:   For this meta-analysis, we searched PubMed for all trials in localised or biochemically recurrent prostate cancer published between Jan 1, 1970, and Jan 15, 2020. Eligible trials had to be randomised, therapeutic, reporting overall survival and at least one intermediate clinical endpoint, and with a sample size of at least 70 participants. Trials of metastatic disease were excluded. Intermediate clinical endpoints included biochemical failure, local failure, distant metastases, biochemical failure-free survival, progression-free survival, and metastasis-free survival. Candidacy for surrogacy was assessed using the second condition of the meta-analytical approach (ie, correlation of the treatment effect of the intermediate clinical endpoint and overall survival), using R2 weighted by the inverse variance of the log intermediate clinical endpoint hazard ratio. The intermediate clinical endpoint was deemed to be a surrogate for overall survival if R2 was 0·7 or greater.  Findings:   75 trials (53 631 patients) were included in our analysis. Median follow-up was 9·1 years (IQR 5·7-10·6). Biochemical failure (R2 0·38 [95% CI 0·11-0·64]), biochemical failure-free survival (R2 0·12 [0·0030-0·33]), biochemical failure and clinical failure (R2 0·28 [0·0045-0·65]), and local failure (R2 0·085 [0·00-0·37]) correlated poorly with overall survival. Progression-free survival (R2 0·46 [95% CI 0·22-0·67]) showed moderate correlation with overall survival, and metastasis-free survival (R2 0·78 [0·59-0·89]) correlated strongly.  Interpretation:   Intermediate clinical endpoints based on biochemical and local failure did not meet the second condition of the meta-analytical approach and are not surrogate endpoints for overall survival in localised prostate cancer.

However, estimates of the costs and benefits of investments to improve cancer survival are scarce, especially for low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). In this analysis, we aimed to estimate the costs and lifetime health and economic benefits of scaling up imaging and treatment modality packages on cancer survival, both globally and by country income group.  Methods:   Using a previously developed model of global cancer survival, we estimated stage-specific cancer survival and life-years gained (accounting for competing mortality) in 200 countries and territories for patients diagnosed with one of 11 cancers (oesophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, anus, liver, pancreas, lung, breast, cervix uteri, and prostate) representing 60% of all cancer diagnoses between 2020 and 2030 (inclusive of full years). We evaluated the costs and health and economic benefits of scaling up packages of treatment (chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, and targeted therapy), imaging modalities (ultrasound, x-ray, CT, MRI, PET, single-photon emission CT), and quality of care to the mean level of high-income countries, separately and in combination, compared with no scale-up. Costs and benefits are presented in 2018 US$ and discounted at 3% annually.  Findings:   For the 11 cancers studied, we estimated that without scale-up (ie, with current availability of treatment, imaging, and quality of care) there will be 76·0 million cancer deaths (95% UI 73·9-78·6) globally for patients diagnosed between 2020 and 2030, with more than 70% of these deaths occurring in LMICs. Comprehensive scale-up of treatment, imaging, and quality of care could avert 12·5% (95% UI 9·0-16·3) of these deaths globally, ranging from 2·8% (1·8-4·3) in high-income countries to 38·2% (32·6-44·5) in low-income countries. Globally, we estimate that comprehensive scale-up would cost an additional $232·9 billion (95% UI 85·9-422·0) between 2020 and 2030 (representing a 6·9% increase in cancer treatment costs), but produce $2·9 trillion (1·8-4·0) in lifetime economic benefits, yielding a return of $12·43 (6·47-33·23) per dollar invested. Scaling up treatment and quality of care without imaging would yield a return of $6·15 (2·66-16·71) per dollar invested and avert 7·0% (3·9-10·3) of cancer deaths worldwide.  Interpretation:   Simultaneous investment in cancer treatment, imaging, and quality of care could yield substantial health and economic benefits, especially in LMICs. These results provide a compelling rationale for the value of investing in the global scale-up of cancer care.

We sought to determine whether 10-year risk of atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) is elevated among those with vs. without a cancer history in a nationally representative U.S. sample.  Methods:   Participants aged 40-79 years with no CVD history were included from the 2007-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Cancer history was self-reported and 10-year risk of ASCVD was estimated using Pooled Cohort Equations. We used logistic regression to estimate associations between cancer history and odds of elevated (≥7.5%) vs. low (<7.5%) 10-year ASCVD risk. An interaction between age and cancer history was examined.  Results:   A total of 15,095 participants were included (mean age = 55.2 years) with 12.3% (n = 1,604) reporting a cancer history. Individuals with vs. without a cancer history had increased odds of elevated 10-year ASCVD risk (OR = 3.42, 95% CI: 2.51-4.66). Specifically, those with bladder/kidney, prostate, colorectal, lung, melanoma, or testicular cancer had a 2.72-10.47 higher odds of elevated 10-year ASCVD risk. Additionally, age was an effect modifier: a cancer history was associated with 1.24 (95% CI: 1.19-4.21) times higher odds of elevated 10-year ASCVD risk among those aged 60-69, but not with other age groups.  Conclusions:   Adults with a history of self-reported cancer had higher 10-year ASCVD risk.

One challenge in spheroid production is forming and maintaining spheroids of uniform size. Here, we developed uniform, high-throughput, multicellular spheroids that self-assemble using microwell plates. DU145 and PC3 cells were cultured as 2D monolayers and 3D spheroids to compare sensitization of TRAIL-resistance cancer cells to TRAIL mediated apoptosis via chemotherapy based on dimensionality. Monocultured monolayers and spheroids were treated with soluble TRAIL alone (24 hr), DTX or CBZ alone (24 hr), or a combination of taxane and TRAIL (24 + 24 hr) to determine the effectiveness of taxanes as TRAIL sensitizers. Upon treatment with soluble TRAIL or taxanes solely, monolayer cells and spheroids exhibited no significant reduction in cell viability compared to the control, indicating that both cell lines are resistant to TRAIL and taxane alone in 2D and 3D. Pretreatment with CBZ or DTX followed by TRAIL synergistically amplified apoptosis in 2D and 3D DU145 cell cultures. PC3 spheroids were more resistant to the combination therapy, displaying a more additive effect in the DTX + TRAIL group compared to 2D. There was a downregulation of DR4/5 expression in spheroid form compared to monolayers in each cell line. Additionally, normal fibroblasts (NFs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were cocultured with both PCa cell lines as spheroids to determine if CAFs confer additional resistance to chemotherapy. We determined that co-cultured spheroids show similar drug resistance to monocultured spheroids when treated with taxane plus TRAIL treatment. Collectively, these findings suggest how the third dimension and cocultures of different cell types effect the sensitization of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells to TRAIL, suggesting therapeutic targets that could overcome TRAIL-resistance in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).""","""['Korie A Grayson', 'Nidhi Jyotsana', 'Nerymar Ortiz-Otero', 'Michael R King']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Taxanes Sensitize Prostate Cancer Cells to TRAIL-Induced Apoptotic Synergy via Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress.', 'TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in breast cancer cells cultured as 3D spheroids.', 'Targeting the stress oncoprotein LEDGF/p75 to sensitize chemoresistant prostate cancer cells to taxanes.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Taxane-based Combination Therapies for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Chemical Activation and Mechanical Sensitization of Piezo1 Enhance TRAIL-Mediated Apoptosis in Glioblastoma Cells.', ""Let's Go 3D!

Currently, number of unnecessary prostate biopsies are being performed in the United States. This is due to the absence of appropriate biopsy decision-making protocol.  Aim:   To develop and validate a 4K score/multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI)-based nomogram to predict prostate cancer (PCa), clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa), and unfavorable prostate cancer (uPCa).  Methods and results:   Retrospective, single-center study evaluating a cohort of 574 men with 4K score test >7% or suspicious digital rectal examination (DRE) or Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) scores 3, 4, or 5 on mpMRI that underwent systematic and/or mpMRI/ultrasound fusion-targeted prostate biopsy between 2016 and 2020. External cohort included 622 men. csPCa and uPCa were defined as Gleason score ≥3 + 4 and ≥4 + 3 on biopsy, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to build nomogram for predicting PCa, csPCa, and uPCa. Validation was performed by plotting the area under the curve (AUC) and comparing nomogram-predicted probabilities with actual rates of PCa, csPCa, and uPCa probabilities in the external cohort. 4K score, a PI-RADS ≥4, prostate volume and prior negative biopsy were significant predictors of PCa, csPCa, and uPCa. AUCs were 0.84, 0.88, and 0.86 for the prediction of PCa, csPCa, and uPCa, respectively. The predicted and actual rates of PCa, csPCa, and uPCa showed agreement across all percentage probability ranges in the validation cohort. Using the prediction model at threshold of 30, 30% of overall biopsies, 41% of benign biopsies, and 19% of diagnosed indolent PCa could be avoided, while missing 9% of csPCa.

We sought to determine if racial/ethnic disparities exist in recommended diabetes care within 12 months of an incident breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer diagnosis. Because co-morbid diabetes decreases long-term survival, identifying predictors of guideline-concordant diabetes care is important.  Methods:   Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry linked to Medicare claims, we included beneficiaries aged 67+ years with diabetes and incident, non-metastatic breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer between 2008 and 2013. Primary outcomes were diabetes care services 12 months after diagnosis: (1) HbA1c test, (2) eye exam, and (3) low-density lipoprotein (LDL) test. Using modified Poisson models with robust standard errors, we examined each outcome separately.  Results:   We included 34,643 Medicare beneficiaries with both diabetes and cancer. Mean age at diagnosis was 76.1 (SD 6.2), 47.2% were women; 35% had breast, 24% colorectal, and 41% prostate cancer. In the 12 months after incident cancer diagnosis, 82.4% received an HbA1c test, 55.3% received an eye exam, 77.8% had an LDL test, and 42.0% received all three tests. Compared to non-Hispanic Whites, Blacks were 3% (95% CI 0.95-0.98) less likely to receive a HbA1c test, 10% (95% CI 0.89-0.92) less likely to receive a LDL test, and 8% (95% 0.89-0.95) less likely to receive an exam eye. Blacks and Hispanics were 16% (95% CI 0.81-0.88) and 7% (0.88-0.98) less likely to receive all three tests, after accounting for confounders. Racial/ethnic differences persisted across cancer types.  Conclusion:   Blacks and Hispanics with breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer and diabetes received less diabetes care after cancer diagnosis compared to non-Hispanic Whites. Differences were not explained by socio-economic factors or clinical need.  Implications for cancer survivors:   Our findings are concerning given the high prevalence of diabetes and poor cancer outcomes among racial/ethnic minorities.

High detection efficacy was reported in biochemical recurrence (BCR) of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy. Thus, we evaluated the preliminary diagnostic utility of [18F]PSMA-1007 PET in patients with prostate cancer, focusing on the BCR which is not detected on conventional imaging.  Methods:   We enrolled a total of 28 patients (age 51-79 years) with BCR of prostate cancer. BCR was defined as a continuous increase in PSA after radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy without any apparent recurrent lesions on conventional diagnostic imaging (CT and bone scintigraphy). PSMA-PET scanning was performed approximately 60 min after intravenous injection of [18F]PSMA-1007 (259 ± 37 MBq). PSMA-PET images were evaluated for lesion detection as well as its relation to PSA values and location.  Results:   Abnormal uptake, which was suspected to be recurrence or metastasis, was detected in 92.9% (26/28) of patients with BCR. The SUVmax was 8.4 ± 6.4 in local recurrence, 11.5 ± 11.8 in pelvic lymph nodes (LN), and 4.1 ± 1.6 in bone metastasis. The detection rates were 66.7% in the PSA group-1 (0.1-0.5 ng/mL), 85.7% in the PSA group-2 (0.5-1.0 ng/mL), and 100% in the PSA group-3 (above 1.0 ng/mL). Among the PET-positive BCR patients (n = 26), local recurrence was detected in 57.7% (15/26), pelvic LN in 42.3% (11/26), and bone metastasis in 15.4% (4/26). In 53% (8/15) of BCR patients who were suspected of local recurrence, focal uptake was detected adjacent to the bladder on [18F]PSMA-1007 PET. This suggested the significant advantage of having minimal physiological urine excretion.  Conclusions:   [18F]PSMA-1007 PET showed a high detection rate in recurrent and metastatic lesions. In patients with BCR, its high detection led to suitable treatment strategies, such as salvage radiation therapy or surgical removal of recurrent lymph nodes.

Methods:   In this multi-institutional study, clinical data of 74 PC patients with 153 bone lesions who were undergoing MDT were retrospectively evaluated. Twenty-seven patients (36.5%) had synchronous, and 47 (63.5%) had metachronous OM. All patients had PC with 5 metastases or fewer detected by 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT and treated using SBRT with a median dose of 20 Gy. The prognostic factors for PC-specific survival (PCSS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed.  Results:   The median follow-up was 27.3 months. Patients with synchronous OM were older and received higher rates of androgen deprivation therapy after SBRT compared with patients with metachronous OM. The 2-year PCSS and PFS rates were 92.0% and 72.0%, respectively. A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline was observed in 56 patients (75.7%), and 48 (64.9%) had a PSA response defined as at least 25% decrease of PSA after MDT. The 2-year local control rate per lesion was 95.4%. In multivariate analysis, single OM and PSA response after MDT were significant predictors for better PCSS and PFS. In-field recurrence was observed in 4 patients (6.5%) with 10 lesions at a median of 13.1 months after MDT completion. No serious late toxicity was observed.

It is also aimed to examine the relationship between peritoneal re-approximation or non-approximation and drain removal time, need for analgesics, passage of flatus, and length of hospital stay. Methods: A total of 247 patients who underwent tRARP by 2 different experienced surgeons were included in the study. At the end of the tRARP procedure, 1 surgeon performed peritoneal re-approximation (Group 1, n = 108), whereas the other performed peritoneal non-approximation (Group 2, n = 139). The effect of the procedures on drain removal time, passage of flatus, need for analgesics, and length of hospital stay were compared between the groups. Results: There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of preoperative parameters including age, body mass index, and preoperative prostate-specific antigen levels (P > .05) (P = .622, P = .126 and P = .591, respectively).

This study aims to retrospectively evaluate the impact of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT on prostate cancer staging and definitive radiation therapy planning.  Methods:   Between April 2015 and June 2020, 366 men with prostate cancer were evaluated with 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT. Of these, 108 patients had PSMA PET/CT before radiation therapy. Radiation was given as primary treatment in 58 (54%) and as salvage radiation therapy for biochemical recurrence after primary surgery in 50 (46%) patients, respectively. Patient and disease characteristics were analyzed, and impact of PSMA PET/CT on disease staging and radiotherapy planning was evaluated in comparison to conventional imaging.  Results:   Median age at presentation was 69 years, and median prostate-specific antigen was 18 ng/mL (3.6-400) for primary and 0.4 ng/mL (0.1-4.6) for salvage radiation, respectively. The combined change of disease stage rate was 36% (39/108) with 45% (26/58) in the subgroup of primary radiation and 26% (13/50) in the patients intended for salvage radiation.

Fifty-four subjects had biopsy-proven prostate cancer (Gleason 6, 15; Gleason 7, 20; Gleason 8, 13; Gleason 9, 6), whereas 21 subjects had negative MRI/ultrasound fusion-guided biopsies. Voxel-wise analysis of contrast signal enhancement was performed for all time points using custom-developed software, including automatic arterial input function detection. Seven descriptive parameter maps were calculated: normalized maximum signal intensity, time to start, time to maximum, time-to-maximum slope, and maximum slope with normalization on maximum signal and the arterial input function (SMN1, SMN2). The parameters were compared with ADC using multiparametric machine-learning models to determine classification accuracy. A Wilcoxon test was used for the hypothesis test and the Spearman coefficient for correlation.  Results:   There were significant differences (P < 0.05) for all 7 DCE-derived parameters between the normal peripheral zone versus PIRADS 4 or 5 lesions and the biopsy-positive versus biopsy-negative lesions. Multiparametric analysis showed better performance when combining ADC + DCE as input (accuracy/sensitivity/specificity, 97%/93%/100%) relative to ADC alone (accuracy/sensitivity/specificity, 94%/95%/95%) and to DCE alone (accuracy/sensitivity/specificity, 78%/79%/77%) in differentiating the normal peripheral zone from PIRADS lesions, biopsy-positive versus biopsy-negative lesions (accuracy/sensitivity/specificity, 68%/33%/81%), and Gleason 6 versus ≥7 prostate cancer (accuracy/sensitivity/specificity, 69%/60%/72%).  Conclusions:   Descriptive perfusion characteristics derived from high-resolution DCE-MRI using model-free computations show significant differences between normal and cancerous tissue but do not reach the accuracy achieved with solely ADC-based classification. Combining ADC with DCE-based input features improved classification accuracy for PIRADS lesions, discrimination of biopsy-positive versus biopsy-negative lesions, and differentiation between Gleason 6 versus Gleason ≥7 lesions.""","""['Hanns C Breit', 'Tobias K Block', 'David J Winkel', 'Julian E Gehweiler', 'Carl G Glessgen', 'Helge Seifert', 'Christian Wetterauer', 'Daniel T Boll', 'Tobias J Heye']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Invest Radiol""","""['High spatiotemporal resolution dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI improves the image-based discrimination of histopathology risk groups of peripheral zone prostate cancer: a supervised machine learning approach.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'The Utility of Diffusion-Weighted Imaging and Perfusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging Parameters for Detecting Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', 'Investigating the equivalent performance of biparametric compared to multiparametric MRI in detection of clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Machine learning classifiers can predict Gleason pattern 4 prostate cancer with greater accuracy than experienced radiologists.', 'Glymphatic system in the thalamus, secondary degeneration area was severely impaired at 2nd week after transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in rats.']"""

This study was aimed at qualitatively and quantitatively analyzing the optimal b-value range of synthetic diffusion-weighted imaging (sDWI) for evaluating prostatic index lesions.  Materials and methods:   This retrospective study included 92 patients who underwent DWI and targeted biopsy for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-suggested index lesions. We generated sDWI at a b-value range of 1000-3000 s/mm² using dedicated software and true DWI data at b-values of 0, 100, and 1000 s/mm². We hypothesized that lesion conspicuity would be best when the background (i.e., MRI-suggested benign prostatic [bP] and periprostatic [pP] regions) signal intensity (SI) is suppressed and becomes homogeneous. To prove this hypothesis, we performed both qualitative and quantitative analyses. For qualitative analysis, two independent readers analyzed the b-value showing the best visual conspicuity of an MRI-suggested index lesion. For quantitative analysis, the readers assessed the b-value showing the same bP and pP region SI. The 95% confidence interval (CI) or interquartile range of qualitatively and quantitatively selected optimal b-values was assessed, and the mean difference between qualitatively and quantitatively selected b-values was investigated.  Results:   The 95% CIs of optimal b-values from qualitative and quantitative analyses were 1761-1805 s/mm² and 1640-1771 s/mm² (median, 1790 s/mm² vs. 1705 s/mm²; p = 0.003) for reader 1, and 1835-1895 s/mm² and 1705-1841 s/mm² (median, 1872 s/mm² vs. 1763 s/mm²; p = 0.022) for reader 2, respectively.

Materials and methods:   Plasma samples from 56 prostate cancer patients were subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify germline mutations and ctDNA analysis using liquid biopsy to detect somatic mutations. Additionally, paired solid cancer tissues from 18 patients were subject to NGS to detect somatic mutations. The clinical parameters and ctDNA profiles of patients with mHSPC were analyzed to evaluate the prognostic value of ctDNA mutations with respect to predicting castration resistance using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.  Results:   Germline mutations occurred in 3.6% of the patients in this cohort, with mutations identified in RAD50 (1.8%) and BRCA1 (1.8%). Somatic mutations detected by liquid biopsy and solid tissue testing were common in TP53 (12.5%), PIK3CA (3.6%), and TMPRSS2-ERG (3.6%). Of the 18 patients with paired tissue testing, two patients had at least one identical somatic mutation in both the liquid biopsy and solid tissue testing.

Adoptive transfer of NK cells is a promising approach to fight cancer; however, for their successful use in cancer treatment, it is necessary to ensure their robust accumulation at tumor foci, provide resistance to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and to engineer them with higher cytotoxic activity. NK lymphocytes are known to kill cancer cells expressing a number of stress ligands; and the balance of signals from inhibitory and activating receptors on the surface of the NK cell determines whether a cytotoxic reaction is triggered. We hypothesized that stronger cytotoxicity of NK cells could be achieved via gene editing aimed at enhancing the activating signaling cascades and/or weakening the inhibitory ones, thereby shifting the balance of signals towards NK cell activation and target cell lysis. Here, we took advantage of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to introduce mutations in the coding sequence of the shp-2 (PTPN11) gene encoding the signaling molecule of inhibitory pathways in NK cells. These shp-2 knock-out NK cells were additionally transduced to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that selectively recognized the antigen of interest on the target cell surface and generated an activating signal. We demonstrate that the combination of shp-2 gene knockout and CAR expression increases the cytotoxicity of effector NK-like YT cells against human prostate cancer cell line Du-145 with ectopic expression of PSMA protein, which is specifically targeted by the CAR.""","""['V G Subrakova', 'S V Kulemzin', 'T N Belovezhets', 'A N Chikaev', 'N A Chikaev', 'O A Koval', 'A A Gorchakov', 'A V Taranin']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Vavilovskii Zhurnal Genet Selektsii""","""['Design and analysis of stably integrated reporters for inducible transgene expression in human T cells and CAR NK-cell lines.', 'Expression of p58.2 or CD94/NKG2A inhibitory receptors in an NK-like cell line, YTINDY, leads to HLA Class I-mediated inhibition of cytotoxicity in the p58.2- but not the CD94/NKG2A-expressing transfectant.', 'Simultaneous engineering of natural killer cells for CAR transgenesis and CRISPR-Cas9 knockout using retroviral particles.', 'CRISPR/Cas9-Based Gene Engineering of Human Natural Killer Cells: Protocols for Knockout and Readouts to Evaluate Their Efficacy.', 'Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-transduced natural killer cells in tumor immunotherapy.', 'Site-specific transgene integration in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies.', 'CAR-NK as a Rapidly Developed and Efficient Immunotherapeutic Strategy against Cancer.', 'Chimeric antigen receptor-engineered NK cells: new weapons of cancer immunotherapy with great potential.', 'The Next Generation of Cellular Immunotherapy: Chimeric Antigen Receptor-Natural Killer Cells.', 'Learning to Be Elite: Lessons From HIV-1 Controllers and Animal Models on Trained Innate Immunity and Virus Suppression.']"""

However, little is known about the contribution of EVs derived from cancer cells to the vicious cycle of bone metastasis. Here, we report a direct regulatory mode between tumour cells and osteoclasts in metastatic niche of prostate cancer via vesicular miRNAs transfer. Combined analysis of miRNAs profiles both in tumour-derived small EVs (sEVs) and osteoclasts identified miR-152-3p as a potential osteolytic molecule. sEVs were enriched in miR-152-3p, which targets osteoclastogenic regulator MAFB. Blocking miR-152-3p in sEVs upregulated the expression of MAFB and impaired osteoclastogenesis in vitro. In vivo experiments of xenograft mouse model found that blocking of miR-152-3p in sEVs significantly slowed down the loss of trabecular architecture, while systemic inhibition of miR-152-3p using antagomir-152-3p reduced the osteolytic lesions of cortical bone while preserving basic trabecular architecture. Our findings suggest that miR-152-3p carried by prostate cancer-derived sEVs deliver osteolytic signals from tumour cells to osteoclasts, facilitating osteolytic progression in bone metastasis.""","""['Qinyu Ma', 'Mengmeng Liang', 'Yutong Wu', 'Ce Dou', 'Jianzhong Xu', 'Shiwu Dong', 'Fei Luo']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Extracell Vesicles""","""['Tumor-derived miR-378a-3p-containing extracellular vesicles promote osteolysis by activating the Dyrk1a/Nfatc1/Angptl2 axis for bone metastasis.', 'Osteoclastic miR-214 targets TRAF3 to contribute to osteolytic bone metastasis of breast cancer.', 'Prostate cancer extracellular vesicles mediate intercellular communication with bone marrow cells and promote metastasis in a cholesterol-dependent manner.', 'Secreted microRNAs in bone metastasis.', 'Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles: The metastatic organotropism drivers.', 'Antagonizing exosomal miR-18a-5p derived from prostate cancer cells ameliorates metastasis-induced osteoblastic lesions by targeting Hist1h2bc and activating Wnt/β-catenin pathway.', 'Extracellular vesicles secreted from bone metastatic renal cell carcinoma promote angiogenesis and endothelial gap formation in bone marrow in a time-dependent manner in a preclinical mouse model.', 'Research progress on the role of extracellular vesicles derived from aging cells in osteoporosis.', 'Non-Coding RNAs of Extracellular Vesicles: Key Players in Organ-Specific Metastasis and Clinical Implications.', 'Nanoengineering facilitating the target mission: targeted extracellular vesicles delivery systems design.']"""

Although existing biomarkers may detect localized prostate cancer, additional strategies are necessary for improving detection and identifying aggressive disease that may require further intervention. One promising, minimally invasive biomarker is cell-free DNA (cfDNA), which consist of short DNA fragments released into circulation by dying or lysed cells that may reflect underlying cancer. Here we investigated whether differences in cfDNA concentration and cfDNA fragment size could improve the sensitivity for detecting more advanced and aggressive prostate cancer. This study included 268 individuals: 34 healthy controls, 112 men with localized prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP), and 122 men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Plasma cfDNA concentration and fragment size were quantified with the Qubit 3.0 and the 2100 Bioanalyzer. The potential relationship between cfDNA concentration or fragment size and localized or mCRPC prostate cancer was evaluated with descriptive statistics, logistic regression, and area under the curve analysis with cross-validation. Plasma cfDNA concentrations were elevated in mCRPC patients in comparison to localized disease (OR5ng/mL = 1.34, P = 0.027) or to being a control (OR5ng/mL = 1.69, P = 0.034). Decreased average fragment size was associated with an increased risk of localized disease compared to controls (OR5bp = 0.77, P = 0.0008). This study suggests that while cfDNA concentration can identify mCRPC patients, it is unable to distinguish between healthy individuals and patients with localized prostate cancer. In addition to PSA, average cfDNA fragment size may be an alternative that can differentiate between healthy individuals and those with localized disease, but the low sensitivity and specificity results in an imperfect diagnostic marker. While quantification of cfDNA may provide a quick, cost-effective approach to help guide treatment decisions in advanced disease, its use is limited in the setting of localized prostate cancer.""","""['Emmalyn Chen', 'Clinton L Cario', 'Lancelote Leong', 'Karen Lopez', 'César P Márquez', 'Carissa Chu', 'Patricia S Li', 'Erica Oropeza', 'Imelda Tenggara', 'Janet Cowan', 'Jeffry P Simko', 'June M Chan', 'Terence Friedlander', 'Alexander W Wyatt', 'Rahul Aggarwal', 'Pamela L Paris', 'Peter R Carroll', 'Felix Feng', 'John S Witte']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Plasma Cell-free DNA Concentration and Outcomes from Taxane Therapy in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer from Two Phase III Trials (FIRSTANA and PROSELICA).', 'Cell-Free DNA Detection of Tumor Mutations in Heterogeneous, Localized Prostate Cancer Via Targeted, Multiregion Sequencing.', 'Assessing the Diagnostic Value of Plasma-Free DNA in Prostate Cancer Screening.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

We explored if tissue N-glycosylation shows prognostic properties for biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival.  Materials and methods:   Tissue N-glycosylation profile was determined from 82 prostate cancer (PCa) patients and prognostic features were compared to clinical and biochemical parameters for BCR-free survival.  Results:   Majority presented with Gleason score 3 + 4 (41%), extensive local disease (62%) and without pelvic lymph nodes invasion (83%). Several parameters (low T stage, low Gleason score, low EAU risk groups for BCR, absence of positive surgical margins, high ratio of fucosylated triantennary structures on total of multiantennary structures [3AFc/MA], low ratio of fucosylated biantennary with core-branched N-acetylglucosamine on total of biantennary structures, and high ratio of triantennary structures on total of multiantennary structures) proved to have a univariate beneficial effect on BCR-free survival. Multivariate analysis proved positive surgical margins and 3AFc/MA to be independent prognosticators.  Conclusions:   Tissue N-glycans are a powerful prognostic tool and can be an asset in PCa as the ratio of 3AFc/MA is independently associated with BCR-free survival.

Methods:   The ST was performed on a needle-by-needle basis. A least square fit of the expected to the measured dose rate was performed using the active dwell positions in the given needle. Two fitting parameters were used to determine the position of each needle relative to the IVD detector: radial (away or toward the detector) and longitudinal (along the axis of the treatment needle). The accuracy of the ST was assessed in a phantom where the geometries of five HDR prostate BT treatments previously treated at our clinic were reproduced. For each of the five treatment geometries, one irradiation was performed with the detector placed in the middle of the implant. Furthermore, four additional irradiations were performed for one of the geometries where the detector was retracted caudally in four steps of 10-15 mm and up to 12 mm inferior of the most inferior active dwell position, which represented the prostate apex. The time resolved dose measurements were retrieved at a rate of 20 Hz using a detector based on an Al2 O3 :C radioluminescence crystal, which was placed inside a standard BT needle. Individual calibrations of the detector were performed prior to each of the nine irradiations.  Results:   Source tracking could be applied in all needles across all nine irradiations. For irradiations with the detector located in the middle region of the implant (a total of 89 needles), the mean ± standard deviation (SD, k = 1) accuracy was -0.01 mm ± 0.38 mm and 0.30 mm ± 0.38 mm in the radial and longitudinal directions, respectively. Caudal retraction of the detector did not lead to reduced accuracy as long as the detector was located superior to the most inferior active dwell positions in all needles. However, reduced accuracy was observed for detector positions inferior to the most inferior active dwell positions which corresponded to detector positions in and inferior to the prostate apex region. Detector positions in the prostate apex and 12 mm inferior to the prostate resulted in mean ± SD (k = 1) ST accuracy of 0.7 mm ± 1 mm and 2.8 mm ± 1.6 mm, respectively, in radial direction, and -1.7 mm ± 1 mm and -2.1 mm ± 1.1 mm, respectively, in longitudinal direction. The largest deviations for the configurations with those detector positions were 2.6 and 5.4 mm, respectively, in the radial direction and -3.5 and -3.8 mm, respectively, in the longitudinal direction.  Conclusion:   This phantom study demonstrates that ST based on IVD during prostate BT is adequately accurate for clinical use. The ST yields submillimeter accuracy on needle positions as long as the IVD detector is positioned superior to at least one active dwell position in all needles. Locations of the detector inferior to the prostate apex result in decreased ST accuracy while detector locations in the apex region and above are advantageous for clinical applications.""","""['Erik B Jørgensen', 'Gustavo Kertzscher', 'Simon Buus', 'Lise Bentzen', 'Steffen B Hokland', 'Susanne Rylander', 'Kari Tanderup', 'Jacob G Johansen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['3D source tracking and error detection in HDR using two independent scintillator dosimetry systems.', 'Time-resolved in\xa0vivo dosimetry for source tracking in brachytherapy.', 'High resolution small-scale inorganic scintillator detector: HDR brachytherapy application.', 'Use of three-dimensional radiation therapy planning tools and intraoperative ultrasound to evaluate high dose rate prostate brachytherapy implants.', 'High dose rate brachytherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer.']"""

The purpose of this study was to analyze the epidemioclinical features and therapy of acute prostatitis associated with noncancerous prostate at the Lubumbashi University Clinics.  Methods:   we conducted a descriptive cross-sectional and retrospective study of a series of 25 patients with documented acute prostatitis and treated at the Lubumbashi University Clinics over a period of four years, from 2015 to 2018. All patients with prostate cancer were excluded from our study. Data were collected via a survey form based on different study parameters divided into 3 categories, namely epidemiological data including age, study period, residence, clinical data with subjective signs, objective signs, general status, findings on rectal examination as well as paramedical data divided into laboratory and imaging tests.  Results:   acute prostatitis associated with noncancerous prostate accounted for 1.27% of all surgical diseases and 7.66% in urology. The most affected age group was 19-37 years (64% of cases), mean age was 33.16±2.4 years. Seventeen patients (68%) were followed up in outpatient clinics and 8 (32%) in hospital. Clinically, fever above 38.5°C was found in 15 patients (60%), dysuria in 11 patients (44%), acute urinary retention in 3 patients (12%), burning during urination in 8 patients (32%), pain syndrome in 21 patients (84%), tender prostate on rectal examination in 18 patients (72%). Ultrasound was the only examination performed in 16 patients (64%). Biologically, assessment of inflammation was performed almost systematically in all patients (100%) including complete blood count (CBC), sedimentation rate (SR), C reactive protein (CRP) levels; blood culture was performed in 4 patients (16%), three of whom had positive blood culture. All patients underwent cytobacteriological examination of the urine or prostatic secretions collected by prostate massage. Urine culture was sterile in 6 patients (24%) and positive in 19 patients (76%). Escherichia coli was the most common germ in 16 out of a total of 19 patients (84.21%). All patients received rectal anti-inflammatory drugs. Fluoroquinolones were the most used antibiotics in 18 patients (64%), twelve of whom received antibiotics as monotherapy. Six out of 25 (24%) cases were associated with orchiepididymitis. The lenght of treatment ranged from 2 to 4 weeks, with either sterilization in secretions or urine or disappearance of leukocyturia as the criteria for treatment discontinuation. Thus, out of 19 patients with positive culture on admission, 14 underwent a second culture (73.68%) at 2 weeks of treatment, three of whom (12%) still had positive test and had to undergo a third culture 4 weeks after they had started treatment. Patient's course was good in 22 cases (88%) with complete clinical and biological remission; three patients (12%) persisted in symptoms which became chronic; no patients had prostatic abscess.  Conclusion:   acute prostatitis associated with noncancerous prostate is a really worrying urological, nosologic condition whose management must be rigorous, especially in people at risk, namely those with intense sexual behaviour.

Besides its roles in adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism, we recently demonstrated an association between PPARG and metastasis in prostate cancer. In this study a functional effect of PPARG on AKT serine/threonine kinase 3 (AKT3), which ultimately results in a more aggressive disease phenotype was identified. AKT3 has previously been shown to regulate PPARG co-activator 1 alpha (PGC1α) localisation and function through its action on chromosome maintenance region 1 (CRM1). AKT3 promotes PGC1α localisation to the nucleus through its inhibitory effects on CRM1, a known nuclear export protein. Collectively our results demonstrate how PPARG over-expression drives an increase in AKT3 levels, which in turn has the downstream effect of increasing PGC1α localisation within the nucleus, driving mitochondrial biogenesis. Furthermore, this increase in mitochondrial mass provides higher energetic output in the form of elevated ATP levels which may fuel the progression of the tumour cell through epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and ultimately metastasis.""","""['Laura C A Galbraith', 'Ernest Mui', 'Colin Nixon', 'Ann Hedley', 'David Strachan', 'Gillian MacKay', 'David Sumpton', 'Owen J Sansom', 'Hing Y Leung', 'Imran Ahmad']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['AKT3 controls mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagy via regulation of the major nuclear export protein CRM-1.', 'Antiepileptic Drug-Activated Constitutive Androstane Receptor Inhibits Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor α and Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor γ Coactivator 1α-Dependent Gene Expression to Increase Blood Triglyceride Levels.', 'VEGF stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis: requirement of AKT3 kinase.', 'PPARγ/PGC1α signaling as a potential therapeutic target for mitochondrial biogenesis in neurodegenerative disorders.', 'PGC-1: The Energetic Regulator in Cardiac Metabolism.', 'The role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors in the tumor microenvironment, tumor cell metabolism, and anticancer therapy.', 'MBTPS2 acts as a regulator of lipogenesis and cholesterol synthesis through SREBP signalling in prostate cancer.', 'Unraveling the Peculiar Features of Mitochondrial Metabolism and Dynamics in Prostate Cancer.', 'A Novel Four Mitochondrial Respiration-Related Signature for Predicting Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer.', 'A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, zaltoprofen, inhibits the growth of extraskeletal chondrosarcoma cells by inducing PPARγ, p21, p27, and p53.']"""

Objective:   The aim of this study was to understand the self-care experiences of prostate cancer survivors before and while receiving androgen deprivation therapy.  Methods:   A qualitative study design with inductive content analysis was used. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 13 prostate cancer survivors in Taiwan treated with androgen deprivation therapy. Data collection and analysis proceeded simultaneously until data saturation was reached.  Results:   The survivors' self-care experiences were categorized into generic categories: physical impacts, psychosocial impacts, lack of supporting information, changing lifestyle habits, coping with physical symptoms, relieving stress, and acquiring disease-related knowledge. These generic categories were then organized into 2 main categories: impacts and adjustments.  Conclusions:   This article describes the experiences of prostate cancer survivors in terms of the impacts of disease and its treatment and adjustments in self-care before and while receiving treatment. It was found that the information acquired by survivors and the adjustment strategies they used were not entirely appropriate or adequate.  Implications for practice:   Healthcare providers should continually assess the self-care experiences of prostate cancer survivors receiving androgen deprivation therapy, provide them with appropriate information, and clarify their understanding. This will improve survivors' disease care-related knowledge, increase the success of their experience of self-care, alleviate their emotional distress, and strengthen their ability to adjust their self-care to cope with the impacts of the disease and its treatment.""","""['Ching-Hui Chien', 'Xuan-Yi Huang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Nurs""","""[""From early detection to rehabilitation in the community: reading beyond the blog testimonies of survivors' quality of life and prostate cancer representation."", 'A Qualitative Study Exploring the Perceptions of Sedentary Behavior in Prostate Cancer Survivors Receiving Androgen-Deprivation Therapy.', 'Nutrition therapy with high intensity interval training to improve prostate cancer-related fatigue in men on androgen deprivation therapy: a study protocol.', 'Intermittent vs Continuous Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Dissecting the effects of androgen deprivation therapy on cadherin switching in advanced prostate cancer: A molecular perspective.', 'Engaging Men of Diverse Racial and Ethnic Groups With Advanced Prostate Cancer in the Design of an mHealth Diet and Exercise Intervention: Focus Group Study.']"""

However, RT resistance can contribute to treatment failure. Prostate cancer stem cells (PCSCs) are radioresistant. We recently found that fractionated irradiation (FIR) upregulates expression of the immune checkpoint B7-H3 (CD276) on PCSCs and bulk cells in each prostate cancer cell line tested. These findings prompted us to investigate whether B7-H3 targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, which may abrogate function of an immune checkpoint and mediate lysis of targeted cells, can target RT-resistant PCSCs in vitro and in vivo. B7-H3 expression is naturally higher on PCSCs than bulk prostate cancer cells and cytotoxicity of B7-H3 CAR T cells to PCSCs is more potent than to bulk prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, FIR significantly upregulates B7-H3 expression on PCSCs and bulk prostate cancer cells. The duration of FIR or single-dose irradiation-induced further upregulation of B7-H3 on bulk prostate cancer cells and PCSCs lasts for up to 3 days. B7-H3 CAR T-cell cytotoxicity against FIR-resistant PCSCs at a low effector to target ratio of 1:1 was assessed by flow cytometry and sphere formation assays. Further upregulation of B7-H3 expression by FIR made PCSCs even more sensitive to B7-H3 CAR T-cell-mediated killing. Consequently, the FIR and B7-H3 CAR T-cell therapy combination is much more effective than FIR or CAR T cells alone in growth inhibition of hormone-insensitive prostate cancer xenografts in immunodeficient mice. Our work provides a sound basis for further development of this unique combinatorial model of RT and B7-H3 CAR T-cell therapy for prostate cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate that FIR significantly upregulates B7-H3 expression by RT-resistant PCSCs and bulk cells; cytotoxicity of B7-H3 CAR T cells to FIR-treated PCSCs is potent and results in significantly improved antitumor efficacy in mice.""","""['Yida Zhang', 'Lile He#', 'Ananthan Sadagopan#', 'Tao Ma', 'Gianpietro Dotti', 'Yufeng Wang', 'Hui Zheng', 'Xin Gao', 'Dian Wang', 'Albert B DeLeo', 'Song Fan', 'Ruochuan Sun', 'Ling Yu', 'Liyuan Zhang', 'Gongxian Wang', 'Soldano Ferrone', 'Xinhui Wang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['B7-H3-redirected chimeric antigen receptor T cells target glioblastoma and neurospheres.', 'CAR T Cells Targeting B7-H3, a Pan-Cancer Antigen, Demonstrate Potent Preclinical Activity Against Pediatric Solid Tumors and Brain Tumors.', 'Preclinical Evaluation of B7-H3-specific Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells for the Treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia.', 'B7-H3-targeted CAR-T cell therapy for solid tumors.', 'B7-H3, a checkpoint molecule, as a target for cancer immunotherapy.', 'B7-H3-targeted CAR T cell activity is enhanced by radiotherapy in solid cancers.', 'Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer, Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors, and Beyond.', 'CAR T cell-based immunotherapy and radiation therapy: potential, promises and risks.', 'IgG-based B7-H3xCD3 bispecific antibody for treatment of pancreatic, hepatic and gastric cancer.', 'State-of-the-art therapeutic strategies for targeting cancer stem cells in prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   The study cohort composed of 6,537 men in The Finnish Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer with prostate cancer diagnosed 1996 to 2009. Use of medication was attained from the nationwide prescription database of the Social Insurance Institution of Finland. Median follow-up was 9.2 years postdiagnosis.

Separate analyses were further adjusted for blood glucose.  Results:   Risk of prostate cancer death was higher among antidiabetic drug users overall (HR = 1.42; 95% CI, 1.18-1.70) compared with nonusers, separately among insulin and metformin users.

Methods:   We conducted a multicenter, retrospective pan-cancer analysis of patients with LRP1B alterations treated with ICI at Duke University, Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and University of Michigan (UM). The primary objective was to assess the association between overall response rate (ORR) to ICI and pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) LRP1B alterations compared with LRP1B variants of unknown significance (VUS). Secondary outcomes were the associations with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) by LRP1B status.  Results:   We identified 101 patients (44 Duke, 35 JHU, 22 UM) with LRP1B alterations who were treated with ICI.

A major drawback of AS is the uncertainty whether a patient truly has low risk PC based on biopsy alone. Multiparametric MRI scan together with biopsy, appears useful in separating patients who need curative therapy from those for whom AS may be safe. Two small clinical trials have shown short-term high-dose vitamin D supplementation may prevent PC progression. There is no substantial evidence for its long-term safety and efficacy, hence its use in the care of men with PC on AS needs assessment. This protocol describes the ProsD clinical trial which aims to determine if oral high-dose vitamin D supplementation taken monthly for 2 years can prevent PC progression in cases with low-to-intermediate risk of progression.  Method and analysis:   This is an Australian national multicentre, 2:1 double-blinded placebo-controlled phase II randomised controlled trial of monthly oral high-dose vitamin D supplementation (50 000 IU cholecalciferol), in men diagnosed with localised PC who have low-to-intermediate risk of disease progression and are being managed by AS.

Objective:   To investigate the ability of pathological T stage and substage to predict CSM for patients with clear-cell, papillary, or chromophobe nmRCC treated with nephrectomy.  Design, setting, and participants:   Using the SEER database for 2004-2016, we identified 87 149 patients with T1-4 N0/X M0 nmRCC treated with nephrectomy for the clear-cell (65 715; 75.4%), papillary (14 587; 16.7%), or chromophobe (6847; 7.9%) histological subtype.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox regression models were used to estimate CSM.  Results and limitations:   For all three histological subtypes, patients with T1a-T3a disease exhibited more favorable CSM than patients with T3b-T4 RCC. For clear-cell RCC, there were clinically meaningful and statistically significant differences for virtually all intergroup comparisons among T1a-T3a stages. For papillary T1a-T3a RCC, clinically meaningful differences disappeared, although the statistical significance remained. For chromophobe T1a-T3a RCC, no clinically meaningful or statistically significant differences were observed. For all three histological subtypes, patients with T3b-T4 RCC exhibited virtually uniformly unfavorable CSM, with no clinically meaningful intergroup CSM differences.  Conclusion:   The use of T stage and substage for stratification of patients with nmRCC treated with nephrectomy revealed differences in CSM among T1a-T3a cases, but not T3b-T4. The magnitude of the CSM difference was greatest for clear-cell, intermediate for papillary, and marginal for chromophobe RCC.

A group of 153 patients with cT1c-3a N0M0 prostate cancer were randomised (73 to control arm and 80 to PRR arm) and 152 completed 12-mo follow-up. For UC defined as no pad use, the recovery hazard ratio at 1-mo follow-up was 2.312 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.081-4.937; p = 0.030). UC recovery was observed in 33.8% of patients in the PRR arm and 18.1% of patients in the control arm (p = 0.022). At 3-mo follow-up the corresponding rates were 58.8% and 43.1% (p = 0.038). The median time to UC recovery was 106 d (95% CI 73-139) in the control arm and 64 d (95% CI 39-89) in PRR arm (p = 0.897). No differences in pathological outcomes or early and late surgical complications were observed between the arms. We conclude that PRR is safe and increases early UC recovery after RARP.

The procedure is safe and increases early recovery of urinary continence.

Objective:   To compare perioperative outcomes for patients undergoing RARC with versus without a history of PPS.  Design, setting, and participants:   The study included 220 consecutive patients treated with RARC and pelvic lymph node dissection for bladder cancer at a single European tertiary centre. Of these, 43 had previously undergone PPS, defined as transurethral resection of the prostate/holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (n=21) or robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (n=22).  Surgical procedure:   RARC in patients with a history of PPS.  Measurements:   Data on postoperative complications were collected according to the quality criteria for accurate and comprehensive reporting of surgical outcomes recommended by the European Association of Urology guidelines. Multivariable logistic, linear, and Poisson regression analyses were performed to test the effect of PPS on surgical outcomes.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 43 patients (20%) were treated with RARC after PPS. Operative time (OT) was longer in the PPS group (360 vs 330min; p<0.001). Patients with PPS experienced higher rates of intraoperative complications (19% vs 6.8%) and higher rates of 30-d (67% vs 39%), and Clavien-Dindo >3 (33% vs 16%) postoperative complications (all p<0.05). Moreover, the positive surgical margin (PSM) rate after RARC was higher in the PPS group (14% vs 4%; p=0.03). On multivariable analyses, PPS at RARC independently predicted higher risk of intraoperative (odds ratio [OR] 2.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-6.21; p=0.01) and 30-d complications (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.05-5.22; p=0.02), as well as longer OT (relative risk [RR] 1.03, 95% CI 1.00-1.05; p=0.02) and length of stay (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.02-1.26; p=0.02). Lack of randomization represents the main limitation.  Conclusions:   RARC in patients with a history of PPS is feasible, but it is associated with a higher risk of complications and longer OT and length of stay. Moreover, higher PSM rates have been reported for these patients. Thus, measures aimed at improving surgical outcomes appear to be warranted.  Patient summary:   We investigated the effect of previous prostate surgery (PPS) on surgical outcomes after robot-assisted removal of the bladder. We found that patients with PPS have a higher risk of complications and longer hospitalization after bladder removal. These patients deserve closer evaluation before this type of bladder operation.""","""['Giuseppe Rosiello', 'Pietro Piazza', 'Victor Tames', 'Rui Farinha', 'Artur Paludo', 'Stefano Puliatti', 'Marco Amato', 'Elio Mazzone', 'Ruben De Groote', 'Camille Berquin', 'Dries Develtere', 'Ralf Veys', 'Celine Sinatti', 'Riccardo Schiavina', 'Geert De Naeyer', 'Peter Schatteman', 'Paul Carpentier', 'Francesco Montorsi', ""Frederiek D'Hondt"", 'Alexandre Mottrie']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Comparing Open Radical Cystectomy and Robot-assisted Laparoscopic Radical Cystectomy: A Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'Comparative effectiveness of robot-assisted vs. open radical cystectomy.', 'Robot-assisted vs open radical cystectomy for bladder cancer in adults.', 'Systematic review and cumulative analysis of oncologic and functional outcomes after robot-assisted radical cystectomy.', 'Systematic review and cumulative analysis of perioperative outcomes and complications after robot-assisted radical cystectomy.', 'Extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical cystectomy with intracorporeal neobladder: a comparison with transperitoneal approach.']"""

MicroRNA-34a (miR-34a) simultaneously targets multiple genes related to the cell apoptosis in CRPC cells without obvious side effects. It has shown great potential in the treatment of CRPC. Previous studies focused on miR-34a increasing the sensitivity of chemotherapy drugs to chemoresistant prostate cancer cells. There are few researches on miR-34a alone in the treatment of CRPC. But the macromolecular miR-34a is difficult to enter the cell and is easily degraded by nuclease. Therefore, we constructed methoxy polyethylene glycol-polylacticco-glycolic acid-polylysine (mPEG-PLGA-PLL) nanoparticles to encapsulate miR-34a (miR-34a/NP). The results showed that miR-34a/NP protects miR-34a from degradation by nucleases and can be phagocytized by PC-3 CRPC cells. Ultrasound induces microbubble cavitation (UIMC) improves cell membrane permeability and capillary gaps, and further promotes miR-34a/NP to enter cells PC-3 and prostate cancer xenografts. The miR-34a/NP that enters the cell and tumor tissue releases miR-34a, which suppressed CRPC cells PC-3 proliferation, promoted its apoptosis, and inhibited the growth of CRPC xenografts.

Hyperpolarized (HP) 13C magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could potentially detect the incipient emergence of CRPC based on early metabolic changes. To characterize metabolic shifts occurring upon the transition from androgen-dependent to castration-resistant prostate cancer (PCa), the metabolism of [U-13C]glucose and [U-13C]glutamine was analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Comparison of steady-state metabolite concentrations and fractional enrichment in androgen-dependent LNCaP cells and transgenic adenocarcinoma of the murine prostate (TRAMP) murine tumors versus castration-resistant PC-3 cells and treatment-driven CRPC TRAMP tumors demonstrated that CRPC was associated with upregulation of glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid metabolism of pyruvate; and glutamine, glutaminolysis, and glutathione synthesis. These findings were supported by 13C isotopomer modeling showing increased flux through pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and anaplerosis; enzymatic assays showing increased lactate dehydrogenase, PDH and glutaminase activity; and oxygen consumption measurements demonstrating increased dependence on anaplerotic fuel sources for mitochondrial respiration in CRPC.

Methods:   Using the Danish national health registries, we identified all patients deceased due to cancer 2010-2015. Anticancer treatment registered in the last 30 days of life was categorized as end-of-life treatment. Predictors of such treatment were investigated using logistic regression models.  Results:   We identified 42,277 patients (median age 70 years) of whom 16% received end-of-life anticancer treatment. This proportion did not change during the study period (p = .09).

The technique often suffers from targeting error due to deviation of the needle as a result of physical interaction between the needle and inhomogeneous tissues. Existing needle guide devices, such as a grid template, do not allow choosing an alternative insertion path to mitigate the deviation because of their limited degree-of-freedom (DoF). This study evaluates how an angulated needle insertion path can reduce needle deviation and improve needle placement accuracy.  Methods:   We extended a robotic needle-guidance device (Smart Template) for in-bore MRI-guided transperineal prostate biopsy. The new Smart Template has a 4-DoF needle-guiding mechanism allowing a translational range of motion of 65 and 58 mm along the vertical and horizontal axis, and a needle rotational motion around the vertical and horizontal axis ± 30 ∘ and a vertical rotational range of - 30 ∘ , + 10 ∘ , respectively. We defined a path planning strategy, which chooses between straight and angulated insertion paths depending on the anatomical structures on the potential insertion path. We performed (a) a set of experiments to evaluate the device positioning accuracy outside the MR-bore, and (b) an in vivo experiment to evaluate the improvement of targeting accuracy combining straight and angulated insertions in animal models (swine, n = 3 ).  Results:   We analyzed 46 in vivo insertions using either straight or angulated insertions paths. The experiment showed that the proposed strategy of selecting straight or angulated insertions based on the subject's anatomy outperformed the conventional approach of just straight insertions in terms of targeting accuracy (2.4 mm [1.3-3.7] vs 3.9 mm [2.4-5.0] {Median IQR } ); p = 0.041 after the bias correction).  Conclusion:   The in vivo experiment successfully demonstrated that an angulated needle insertion path could improve needle placement accuracy with a path planning strategy that takes account of the subject-specific anatomical structures.""","""['Pedro Moreira#', 'John Grimble#', 'Nicusor Iftimia', 'Camden P Bay', 'Kemal Tuncali', 'Jesung Park', 'Junichi Tokuda']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Preclinical evaluation of an MRI-compatible pneumatic robot for angulated needle placement in transperineal prostate interventions.', 'Evaluation of robot-assisted MRI-guided prostate biopsy: needle path analysis during clinical trials.', 'In-bore setup and software for 3T MRI-guided transperineal prostate biopsy.', 'Targeted prostate biopsy and MR-guided therapy for prostate cancer.', 'MR-Guided Prostate Interventions.', 'Motorized template for MRI-guided focal cryoablation of prostate cancer.', 'MR conditional prostate intervention systems and actuations review.']"""

However, it should be kept in mind that radiotherapy of cancer is still accompanied by adverse side effects, and a better understanding and improvement of radiotherapy can extend the life expectancy of patients following the treatment of malignant tumours. In this study, the dose distributions measured with thermoluminescent detectors (TLDs) inside a tissue-equivalent adult human phantom exposed for lung and prostate cancer using the modern proton beam scanning radiotherapy technique were compared. Since the TLD detection efficiency depends on the ionization density of the radiation to be detected, and since this efficiency is detector specific, four different types of TLDs were used to compare their response in the mixed radiation fields. Additionally, the dose distributions from two different cancer treatment modalities were compared using the selected detectors. The measured dose values were benchmarked against Monte Carlo simulations and available literature data. The results indicate an increase in the lateral dose with an increase of the primary proton energy. However, the radiation quality factor of the mixed radiation increases by 20% in the vicinity to the target for the lower initial proton energy, due to the production of secondary charged particles of low-energy and short range. For the cases presented here the MTS-N TLD detector seems to be the most optimal tool for dose measurements within the target volume, while the MCP-N TLD detector, due to an interplay of its enhanced thermal neutron response and decreased detection efficiency to highly ionising radiation, is a better choice for the out-of-field measurements.

However, few published studies have investigated associations between functional variants of MHC-I-related genes and clinical outcomes of lung cancer patients.  Methods:   We performed a two-phase Cox proportional hazards regression analysis by using two previously published genome-wide association studies to evaluate associations between genetic variants in the MHC-I-related gene set and the survival of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, followed by expression quantitative trait loci analysis.  Results:   Of the 7811 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 89 genes of 1185 NSCLC patients in the discovery dataset of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, 24 SNPs remained statistically significant after validation in additional 984 NSCLC patients from the Harvard Lung Cancer Susceptibility Study. In a multivariate stepwise Cox model, three independent functional SNPs (ERAP1 rs469783 T > C, PSMF1 rs13040574 C > A and NCF2 rs36071574 G > A) remained significant with an adjusted hazards ratio (HR) of 0.83 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.77-0.89, P = 8.0 × 10-7], 0.86 (0.80-0.93, P = 9.4 × 10-5) and 1.31 (1.11-1.54, P = 0.001) for overall survival (OS), respectively. Further combined genotypes revealed a poor survival in a dose-response manner in association with the number of unfavorable genotypes (Ptrend < 0.0001 and 0.0002 for OS and disease-specific survival, respectively). Also, ERAP1 rs469783C and PSMF1 rs13040574A alleles were associated with higher mRNA expression levels of their genes.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel therapeutics to overcome these obstacles. It was recently demonstrated that upregulated expression of monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) contributes to the progression of NSCLC. G10, a tumor‑targeting representative conjugate of heptamethine carbocyanine dye and an inhibitor of MAOA, was shown to exert potent cytotoxic effects, comparable to those of doxorubicin, against prostate cancer cell lines, as well as moderate MAOA inhibitory activity. The research described herein aimed to extend our previous study on the antitumor function of G10 in NSCLC in vitro and in vivo, and to elucidate the mechanisms through which G10 exerts its antineoplastic effects. G10 markedly inhibited the proliferation of paclitaxel‑resistant NSCLC cells (H460/PTX) and reduced tumor cell migration and invasion. Gene expression profiling of paclitaxel‑resistant NSCLC cells following treatment with G10 demonstrated that the expression of genes associated with the extracellular matrix was significantly affected, particularly the metastasis‑related genes matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)2, MMP14 and COL6A, which exhibited notably reduced expression. Additionally, the results also demonstrated that MAOA‑related pathways, including AKT and hypoxia‑inducible factor‑1α, were also inhibited by G10 treatment and, subsequently, the downstream molecules of these pathways, such as p21, MMP2 and vascular endothelial growth factor, were also downregulated, highlighting a possible mechanism through which G10 suppresses tumor cell migration, invasion and proliferation. Importantly, in mouse NSCLC xenografts, combined treatment with G10 and paclitaxel resulted in pronounced inhibition of tumor growth. Taken together, the results of the present study highlight the potential of G10 as a novel therapeutic targeting MAOA in paclitaxel‑resistant NSCLC.""","""['Xiao-Guang Yang#', 'Yan-Yu Li#', 'Dong-Xue Zhao', 'Wei Cui', 'Han Li', 'Xin-Yu Li', 'Yu-Xin Li', 'Dun Wang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Potential monoamine oxidase A inhibitor suppressing paclitaxel-resistant non-small cell lung cancer metastasis and growth.', 'Design, Synthesis, and Evaluation of Monoamine Oxidase A Inhibitors⁻Indocyanine Dyes Conjugates as Targeted Antitumor Agents.', 'Application of novel pH sensitive isoniazid-heptamethine carbocyanine dye conjugates against prostate cancer cells.', 'A novel STAT3 inhibitor W2014-S regresses human non-small cell lung cancer xenografts and sensitizes EGFR-TKI acquired resistance.', 'Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA): A promising target for prostate cancer therapy.', 'An Integrative Metabolomic and Network Pharmacology Study Revealing the Regulating Properties of Xihuang Pill That Improves Anlotinib Effects in Lung Cancer.']"""

In the present study, it was revealed that inhibition of TR4 by shRNA in PCa enhanced the sensitivity to docetaxel in vitro and in vivo. TR4 induced the downregulation of miR‑145 by directly binding it to the promoter of miR‑145, which was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and luciferase assay. The overexpression of miR‑145 suppressed both the chemoresistance and the expression of OCT4 mRNA and protein. Additionally, the TR4 shRNA mediated re‑sensitization to docetaxel, along with the downregulated expression of OCT4, were reversed by the concurrent inhibition of miR‑145. The luciferase assay revealed that the activity of the wild‑type OCT4 3' untranslated region reporter was suppressed. This suppression diminished when the miR‑145 response element mutated.

The signalling pathway by which CDCA5 functions through was also attempted to elucidate. Clinical specimens of PCa patients were collected from the Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University. The expression level of CDCA5 in cancer tissues and paracancerous tissues from PCa patients was detected by RT-qPCR analysis and IHC. The relationship between the expression level of CDCA5 and the survival rate of PCa patients was analysed using TCGA database. Two stable cell lines (C4-2 and PC-3) with CDCA5 knockdown were established, and the effects of CDCA5 on PCa cell proliferation were detected by MTT and colony formation assays. Flow cytometry was performed to detect the effect of CDCA5 on the PCa cell division cycle, and western blot analysis was used to determine changes in ERK phosphorylation levels after CDCA5 knockdown. The effect of CDCA5 expression on prostate tumour growth was assessed using a mouse xenograft model. The results revealed that the mRNA and protein expression levels of CDCA5 were significantly higher in PCa tissues than in paracancerous tissues. High CDCA5 expression was associated with the prognosis of patients with PCa. CDCA5 expression knockdown significantly reduced the number of PCa cells in mitoses and inhibited their proliferation in vitro and in vivo. When CDCA5 was knocked down, the phosphorylation level of ERK was also reduced. Collectively, CDCA5 was upregulated and affected the prognosis of patients with PCa. Decreased CDCA5 expression inhibited PCa cell proliferation by inhibiting the ERK signalling pathway.

However, the effects of the NBD peptide on the malignant properties of cancer cells that express S100A4 remain to be elucidated. The present study demonstrates that the NBD peptide inhibits the invasiveness and metastasis of highly metastatic human mammary carcinoma cells. The introduction of the peptide into MDA‑MB‑231 variant cells resulted in the suppression of matrix degradation in a gelatin invadopodia assay and invasiveness in a Matrigel invasion assay. In line with these results, the peptide significantly downregulated the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)‑14 (MT1‑MMP). Mechanistic analysis of the downregulation of MMP‑14 revealed the suppression of the expression of the transcription factor, specificity protein 1 (Sp1), but not that of nuclear factor (NF)‑κB, early growth response 1 (EGR1) or ELK3, all of which were reported to be involved in transcriptional regulation of the MMP‑14 gene. At the same time, evidence suggested that the NBD peptide also suppressed Sp1 and MMP‑14 expression levels in MDA‑MB‑468 cells. Importantly, the intravenous administration of the NBD peptide encapsulated in liposomes inhibited pulmonary metastasis from mammary gland tumors in mice with xenograft tumors. These results indicate that the NBD peptide can suppress malignant tumor growth through the suppression of the Sp1/MMP‑14 axis. Taken together, these results reveal that the NBD peptide acts on not only endothelial cells, but also on tumor cells in an integrated manner, suggesting that the peptide may prove to be a promising cancer therapeutic peptide drug.""","""['Keizo Takenaga', 'Takahiro Ochiya', 'Hideya Endo']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Structural features of methionine aminopeptidase2-active core peptide essential for binding with S100A4.', 'S100A4 drives non-small cell lung cancer invasion, associates with poor prognosis, and is effectively targeted by the FDA-approved anti-helminthic agent niclosamide.', 'Arsenic sulfide inhibits cell migration and invasion of gastric cancer in vitro and in vivo.', 'S100a4 upregulation in Pik3caH1047R;Trp53R270H;MMTV-Cre-driven mammary tumors promotes metastasis.', 'The emerging role of MMP14 in brain tumorigenesis and future therapeutics.', 'The immunomodulatory role of matrix metalloproteinases in colitis-associated cancer.']"""

In the progression of CRPC, androgen receptor (AR) and its splice variants play critical roles. Hence, it is necessary to develop a drug to inhibit the expression and activity of the full‑length and splice variants of AR for the treatment of CRPC. Erastin, as the first discovered drug to induce ferroptosis, has been studied in various types of cancer. However, there are few studies focusing on the relationship between erastin and AR. In the present study, western blotting, and sulforhodamine B cell viability, glutathione, lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species assays were performed to verify the ferroptosis of CRPC cells; reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction, dual‑luciferase reporter, and lentiviral packaging and lentivirus‑infected cell assays were employed to evaluate how erastin affects AR. A mouse xenograft assay was used to determine the underlying mechanism in vivo.

In addition to causing significant respiratory pathology, infection with SARS-CoV-2 (like infection with other respiratory viruses) directly or indirectly results in abnormal vasculature, which may contribute to hypoxemia. These vascular effects cause significant morbidity and may contribute to mortality from the disease. Given that abnormal vasculature and poor oxygenation are also hallmarks of solid tumors, lessons from the treatment of cancer may help identify drugs that can be repurposed to treat COVID-19. Although the mechanisms that result in vascular abnormalities in COVID-19 are not fully understood, it is possible that there is dysregulation of many of the same angiogenic and thrombotic pathways as seen in patients with cancer. Many anticancer therapeutics, including androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and immune checkpoint blockers (ICB), result in vascular normalization in addition to their direct effects on tumor cells. Therefore, these therapies, which have been extensively explored in clinical trials of patients with cancer, may have beneficial effects on the vasculature of patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, these drugs may have additional effects on the disease course, as some ADTs may impact viral entry, and ICBs may accelerate T-cell-mediated viral clearance.

Here, we compared by microarray hybridization the mRNA levels in pooled DLP tissues and individual neuroendocrine carcinomas to characterize potential molecular targets of AGN extract and D/DA. Clustering and principal component analyses supported distinct gene expression profiles of TRAMP DLP versus neuroendocrine carcinomas. Pathway Enrichment, Gene Ontology, and Ingenuity Pathway Analyses of differential genes indicated that AGN and D/DA affected chiefly processes of lipid and mitochondrial energy metabolism and oxidation-reduction in TRAMP DLP, while AGN affected neuronal signaling, immune systems and cell cycling in neuroendocrine carcinomas. Protein-Protein Interaction Network analysis predicted and reverse transcription-PCR verified multiple hub genes common in the DLP of AGN- and D/DA-treated TRAMP mice at 28 WOA and select hub genes attributable to the non-D/DA AGN components. The vast majority of hub genes in the AGN-treated neuroendocrine carcinomas differed from those in TRAMP DLP. In summary, the transcriptomic approach illuminated vastly different signaling pathways and networks, cellular processes, and hub genes of two TRAMP prostate malignancy lineages and their associations with the interception efficacy of AGN and D/DA.

Methods and materials:   Pathologist-annotated prostatectomy midgland histology sections from 12 patients were registered to preprostatectomy mpMRI scans that were interpreted by four radiologists. To simulate realistic HDR-BT, we registered each observer's mpMRI-DILs and corresponding histology to two transrectal ultrasound images of other HDR-BT patients with a 15-Gy whole-gland prescription. We used clinical inverse planning to escalate the mpMRI-DILs to 20.25 Gy. We compared the dose that the histopathology would have received if treated with standard treatment plans to the dose mpMRI-targeting would have achieved. The histopathology was grouped as high-grade cancer (any Gleason Grade 4 or 5) and low-grade cancer (only Gleason Grade 3).  Results:   212 mpMRI-targeted HDR-BT plans were analyzed. For high-grade histology, the mpMRI-targeted plans achieved significantly higher median [IQR] D98 and D90 values of 18.2 [16.7-19.5] Gy and 19.4 [17.8-20.9] Gy, respectively, in comparison with the standard plans (p = 0.01 and p = 0.003). For low-grade histology, the targeted treatment plans would have resulted in a significantly higher median D90 of 17.0 [16.1-18.4] Gy in comparison with standard plans (p = 0.015); the median D98 was not significantly higher (p = 0.2).

To meet a satisfactory performance, three conformations of pre-design DNA aptamers including two stem-loop structures and a double strand structure have been investigated and compared. All of them are immobilized on gold electrode as capture probes with redox-active molecular. The mechanism of signal transduction depends on molecular recognition events involving aptamer conformational changes, thus influencing the charge transfer. A short, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) pseudoknot forming two stem-loop structural aptamers with labeled MB at the 3' -terminus was found to posse the highest signal variation than other structure when induced by PSA due to the strong conformational change. With the optimized capture strand, the aptasensor showed the peak current increase of MB by the binding relationship between PSA and the sensor over a wide concentration range of 4 magnitude orders. The proposed aptasensor exhibited a wide detection range from 10 pg/mL to 500 ng/mL with a low detection limit of 1.24 pg/mL (S/N = 3). Moreover, the electrochemical aptasensor demonstrated good reproducibility, sensitivity, selectivity, and reliability for the detection of PSA.

Dual luciferase assay were used for analysis of the interactions among MBNL1-AS1, miR-181a-5p, and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). Subsequently, the expression of PTEN and proteins in PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling was examined using western blot analysis after transfection with miR-181a-5p mimic.

Results indicated that MBNL1-AS1 was conspicuously downregulated while miR-181a-5p upregulating in PCa tissues and cell lines. MBNL1-AS1 overexpression decreased the abilities of cell proliferation, invasion, and migration.

Caffeine content was not affected by roasting, chlorogenic acid was degraded due to the temperature, and caffeic acid increased in light roasted and decreased in medium and dark roasted. Green and light roasted coffee extracts promoted higher inhibition of cell viability, caused greater cell cycle arrest in S and G2/M and induced apoptosis more compared to medium and dark roasted coffee extracts and the control samples.

Curcumin is an anticancer agent, but its clinical applications are impeded due to the poor water solubility and bioavailability. Prepared blank Tf-SLNs showed minimal cytotoxicity while Tf-CRC-SLNs demonstrated significant in-vitro anti-proliferative activity compared to CRC-SLNs alone. Cellular uptake of Tf-CRC-SLNs were found to be significantly higher (p < 0.05/=0.01) compared to unconjugated SLNs or pure drug alone. Bioconjugated Tf-CRC-SLNs also showed improved early apoptotic and late apoptotic or early necrotic populations (6.4% and 88.9% respectively) to CRC-SLNs and CRC solution. Most importantly, in-vivo studies with Tf-CRC-SLNs in mice bearing prostate cancer revealed significant tumour regression (392.64 mm3 after 4 weeks, p < 0.001) compared to the control group.

Radiation (RT) can promote immunogenic cell death with increased antitumor T cell activity but also stimulates suppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs). Because metabolic alterations affect immune homeostasis and prior studies show caloric restriction (CR) combined with RT improves preclinical TNBC outcomes, we hypothesized that CR augments RT, in part, by altering intratumoral immunity. Using an in vivo model of TNBC, we treated mice with ad libitum (AL) diet, radiation, a CR diet, or CR + RT, and demonstrated an immune suppressive environment with a significant increase in CD4+ CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs after RT but not in CR-fed mice. CD8:Treg ratio in CR + RT TIL increased 4-fold compared with AL + RT mice. In vivo CD8 depletion was performed to assess the role of effector T cells in mitigating the effects of CR, and it was found that in mice undergoing CR, depletion of CD8 T cells resulted in increased tumor progression and decreased median survival compared with isotype control-treated mice. In addition, PD-1 expression on CD3+CD8+ T cells within the tumor microenvironment was significantly increased in CR + RT versus AL + RT treated mice as per immunofluorescence. Serum from breast cancer patients undergoing RT alone or CR and RT was collected pre- and postintervention, and a cytokine array demonstrated that patients treated with CR + RT had notable decreases in immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-2Rγ, IL-10Rβ, and TGF-β2 and 3 compared with patients receiving RT alone. In conclusion, combining CR with RT decreases intratumoral Tregs, increases CD8:Treg, and increases PD-1 expression via a process dependent on CD8 T cells in a TNBC model. Breast cancer patients undergoing CR concurrently with RT also had significant reduction in immunosuppressive cytokine levels compared with those receiving RT alone.""","""['Gregor Manukian', 'Charles Kivolowitz', 'Tiziana DeAngelis', 'Anuradha A Shastri', 'Jason E Savage', 'Kevin Camphausen', 'Ulrich Rodeck', 'Jelani C Zarif', 'Nicole L Simone']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Dual blockade of PD-1 and CTLA-4 combined with tumor vaccine effectively restores T-cell rejection function in tumors.', 'Composition and plasticity of triple-negative breast carcinoma-infiltrating regulatory T cells.', 'Stereotactic Radiotherapy Increases Functionally Suppressive Regulatory T Cells in the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'The Tumor Immune Microenvironment in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.', 'Regulatory T Cells: Barriers of Immune Infiltration Into the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Low-Dose Non-Targeted Effects and Mitochondrial Control.', 'Tumor microenvironment-mediated immune evasion in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Metabolic communication in the tumour-immune microenvironment.', 'Replenishment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) overrides CR-mediated protection against tumor growth in a murine model of triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Short-Term Fasting Synergizes with Solid Cancer Therapy by Boosting Antitumor Immunity.']"""

Objective:   We aimed to investigate the role of BAIAP2L2 in the progression of PCa and decipher the underlying mechanisms.  Methods:   RNA sequencing data from TCGA database were used to evaluate the expression of BAIAP2L2 in PCa. Survival analysis and Cox regression model analysis were conducted to evaluate the prognostic value of BAIAP2L2. BAIAP2L2-associated pathways were preliminary analyzed by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) method and confirmed by western blot assays. Cell proliferation and transwell assays were performed to determine biological behaviors in BAIAP2L2 knocked-down or overexpressed PCa cell lines including LNCaP and PC-3 cells.  Results:   In our study, BAIAP2L2 was significantly up-regulated in PCa tissues and cell lines and independently associated with the poor prognosis of PCa patients. Knockdown of BAIAP2L2 notably repressed proliferation, migration and invasion of PCa cells. And overexpression of BAIAP2L2 obtained the contrary results. Mechanically, GSEA method and western blot results of key molecules in signaling pathways implicated that the depletion of BAIAP2L2 inactivated the vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) and induced apoptosis signaling pathways in PCa cells.

Methods:   Prostate cancer follow-up recommendations were extracted from the European Association of Urology guidelines from 2000 to 2015. Per patient costs were calculated with a detailed micro-costing approach considering direct and indirect medical expenses. Input parameters were derived from expert interviews, literature research, and official scales of tariffs. Costs for insurers, providers, and payers were included to estimate societal costs.  Results:   Mean 10-year follow-up costs per patient after treatment with curative intent amounted to EUR 4415 in 2000, EUR 4224 in 2008 (p < 0.001), and EUR 5159 in 2015 (p < 0.001). Costs after hormone therapy with metastasis cumulated to EUR 10,846 in 2000, EUR 9818 in 2008 (p < 0.001), and EUR 11,978 in 2015 (p < 0.001). While insurers covered 37% of costs in 2000 (EUR 1664), only 23% of costs were reimbursed in 2015 (EUR 1195; p < 0.001). Cost sources mainly included consultations (55%), transportation (18%), and imaging (27%).  Conclusion:   Early detection and advances in prostate cancer treatment increased 10-year survival rates beyond 80% in Germany, ultimately expanding the number of survivors requiring follow-up. Statutory insurers reacted by decreasing the reimbursement rates to reduce per patient cost by up to 46%. Consequently, the economic burden was mainly shifted to payers and providers.

Methods:   From March 2016 to Dec. 2018, 75 men with suspected PCa prospectively underwent fusion-guided prostate biopsy. TDI overlaid on predefined target lesion were compared to the confirmed contralateral tumor-free area of the prostate gland (using Image J).

However, its broader roles as a downstream target of mTORC1 are unknown. Therefore, we directly compared ATF4-dependent transcriptional changes induced upon insulin-stimulated mTORC1 signaling to those activated by the ISR. In multiple mouse embryo fibroblast and human cancer cell lines, the mTORC1-ATF4 pathway stimulated expression of only a subset of the ATF4 target genes induced by the ISR, including genes involved in amino acid uptake, synthesis, and tRNA charging.

The aim of this study was to investigate if anatomically robust PT (ARPT) plans incorporating patient-specific target motion improved target coverage while still sparing normal tissues, when applied on locally advanced prostate cancer patients where pelvic irradiation is indicated.  Material and methods:   A planning computed tomography (CT) scan used for dose calculation and two additional CTs (acquired on different days) were used to make patient-specific targets for the ARPT plans on the eight included patients. The plans were compared to a conventional robust PT plan and a volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) photon plan, which were derived from the planning CT (pCT). Worst-case robust optimisation was used for all proton plans with a setup uncertainty of 5 mm and a range uncertainty of 3.5%. Target coverage (V95% and D95%) and normal tissue doses (V5-75 Gy) were evaluated on 6-8 rCTs per patient.  Results:   The ARPT plans improved the prostate target coverage for the most challenging patient compared to conventional robust PT plans (20% point increase for V95% and 31 Gy increase for D95%). Across the whole cohort the estimated mean value for V95% was 97% for the ARPT plans and 95% for the conventional robust PT plans. The ARPT plans had a slight, statistically insignificant increase in normal tissue doses compared to the conventional robust proton plans. Compared to VMAT, the ARPT plans significantly reduced the normal tissue doses in the low-to-intermediate dose range.

Specialty pharmacies integrated within a health system are able to access records, assess therapy, and efficiently communicate with prescribers. OBJECTIVE: To analyze interventions made by clinical pharmacists within the Cleveland Clinic Specialty Pharmacy (CCSP) regarding cost avoidance for the health care system and improvements in patient safety. METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational study that analyzed pharmacist interventions regarding specialty hematology/oncology medications. Interventions were measured with pharmacist documentation within the electronic health record (EHR). The primary endpoint was the cost-avoidance effect of clinical pharmacist interventions resulting from pharmacist access to the EHR. Secondary endpoints included pharmacist interventions that led to additional ancillary or supportive care, time taken to perform interventions, total interventions according to new or refill status, and total interventions performed according to insurance subtype. RESULTS: 547 interventions were identified during the study period, with a total cost avoidance of $1,508,131. The intervention with the highest overall cost savings was discontinuation of therapy ($290,091). The highest cost savings, based on intervention type, was lack of follow-up ($30,892). The medication with the highest overall cost savings was abiraterone ($273,160). Gilteritinib was associated with the highest cost saving per intervention ($28,350). The indication with the highest overall cost savings was prostate cancer ($402,601), while cutaneous T-cell lymphoma had the highest cost savings per intervention ($25,424). CONCLUSIONS: CCSP pharmacist interventions led to significant overall cost savings to the health care system. Although not measured in this study, it is reasonable to expect that decreased medication use may also translate into less financial burden for patients, as well as for pharmacy benefit managers. Access to the EHR and integration within the health care system may have facilitated the cost savings.

Methods:   Data from five population-based PROFILES registry samples (i.e. lymphoma (n = 993), multiple myeloma (n = 156), colorectal (n = 3989), thyroid (n = 306), endometrial (n = 741), prostate cancer (n = 696)) were used. Causal attributions were assessed with a single question.  Results:   The five most often reported causal attributions combined were unknown (21%), lifestyle (19%), biological (16%), other (14%), and stress (12%). Lymphoma (49%), multiple myeloma (64%), thyroid (55%), and prostate (64%) cancer patients mentioned fixed causes far more often than modifiable or modifiable/fixed. Colorectal (33%, 34%, and 33%) and endometrial (38%, 32%, and 30%) cancer survivors mentioned causes that were fixed, modifiable, or both almost equally often. Colorectal, endometrial, and prostate cancer survivors reported internal causes most often, whereas multiple myeloma survivors more often reported external causes, while lymphoma and thyroid cancer survivors had almost similar rates of internal and external causes. Females, those older, those treated with hormonal therapy, and those diagnosed with prostate cancer were less likely to identify modifiable causes while those diagnosed with stage 2, singles, with ≥2 comorbid conditions, and those with endometrial cancer were more likely to identify modifiable causes.  Conclusion:   In conclusion, this study showed that patients report both internal and external causes of their illness and both fixed and modifiable causes. This differsbetween the various cancer types.  Implications for cancer survivors:   Although the exact cause of cancer in individual patients is often unknown, having a well-informed perception of the modifiable causes of one's cancer is valuable since it can possibly help survivors with making behavioural adjustments in cases where this is necessary or possible.""","""['Carla Vlooswijk', 'Olga Husson', 'Simone Oerlemans', 'Nicole Ezendam', 'Dounya Schoormans', 'Belle de Rooij', 'Floortje Mols']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Cancer Surviv""","""['Diagnosed with a common cancer at an unusual age: causal attributions of survivors of adolescent and young adult colorectal cancer.', 'Causal attribution among cancer survivors of the 10 most common cancers.', 'Having co-morbid cardiovascular disease at time of cancer diagnosis: already one step behind when it comes to HRQoL?', 'What causes breast cancer?

We also developed a novel prediction model for Ra-223 treatment completion using these predictors.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed data from 122 patients with mCRPC who were treated with Ra-223. The predictive factors for the completion of six cycles of Ra-223 treatment were evaluated. Statistically significant predictive factors were then used to develop a prediction model for treatment completion. Finally, using this prediction model, we classified the overall survival (OS) of the entire cohort into three groups.  Results:   We identified three significant variables as the predictive factors for treatment completion: baseline alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level, baseline hemoglobin (Hb) level, and baseline pain. The three groups generated using the prediction model were: group 1 (patients with three predictive factors, i.e., ALP < median, Hb ≥ median, and no pain), group 2 (patients with one to two predictive factors), and group 3 (patients without any predictive factors). The treatment completion rates differed between the three groups significantly. Furthermore, the OS also differed among the groups significantly.  Conclusion:   Our study suggested that the baseline ALP level, baseline Hb level, and baseline pain were the predictive factors of completion of all six cycles of Ra-223 treatment in patients with mCRPC. Our prediction model consisting of these factors could predict not only the completion of Ra-223 treatment, but also the post-treatment survival.

An early diagnosis substantially increases the survival rate and treatment success. Thus, it is important to establish biomarkers which could reliably identify cancer patients. As cancer is associated with changes in the systemic trace element status and distribution, serum concentrations of selenium, iron, copper, and zinc could contribute to an early diagnosis. To test this hypothesis, case control studies measuring trace elements in cancer patients vs. matched controls were selected and discussed focusing on lung, prostate, breast, and colorectal cancer. Overall, cancer patients had elevated serum copper and diminished zinc levels, while selenium and iron did not show consistent changes for all four cancer types.

Aim:   To explore men's experiences of support for sexual dysfunction following PCa diagnosis.  Methods:   This study included a U.K.-wide survey of men 18-42 months post-diagnosis of PCa, identified through cancer registries. The survey measured sexual function and the extent to which men perceived sexual dysfunction to be a problem (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-26), access to and experience of medications, devices, and specialist services for sexual dysfunction, and included a free-text question for further comments. Analysis focussed on men who reported poor sexual function, which they considered a moderate or big problem. Descriptive statistics explored the characteristics of men offered intervention and those that found this helpful. Free-text responses were analyzed using thematic analysis.  Outcome:   The main outcome of this study was to assess access to and experience of medications, devices, and specialist services for sexual dysfunction.  Results:   39.0% of all survey respondents (13,978/35,823) reported poor sexual function, which they considered a moderate or big problem. 51.7% of these men were not offered any intervention to aid sexual functioning. 71.9% of those offered an intervention reported trying it, of whom 48.7% found the intervention helpful. Men treated with surgery or brachytherapy were most likely to be offered an intervention. Medication was the most commonly offered intervention and 39.3% of those who tried medication found this helpful. Although offered less often, approximately half of the men who tried devices or attended specialist services found the intervention helpful. Free-text responses indicated that barriers to accessing support included inadequate information and support from healthcare professionals, embarrassment, negative views about treatment options, concerns about side effects and safety, and inconsistencies between secondary and primary care. Barriers to continuing use included limited effectiveness of treatments, inadequate ongoing support, and funding constraints. Drivers of sexual recovery included patient proactivity and persistence with trying different treatment options and ongoing support from health professionals.  Clinical implications:   There is an urgent need to ensure that all men are offered, and have equal access to, sexual care support, with referral to specialist services when required.  Strengths & limitations:   This study presents data from a large, U.K.-wide, population-based study of men with PCa and includes quantitative and qualitative findings. The possibility of non-response bias should, however, be considered.  Conclusion:   There are significant shortcomings in the support offered to U.K. men with sexual dysfunction following diagnosis and treatment for PCa which need to be addressed.

Enoxacin, a third-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, was found with anti-proliferative effects against many cancer types. This study was to further investigate its effects against prostate cancer and explore the underlying molecular mechanisms.  Methods:   PC-3 cells were treated with Enoxacin at different concentrations. Tumor model was established by subcutaneously injecting PC-3 cells into nude mice. MTT assay was used to detect cell viability. ELISA assay, Annexin V/PI staining and TUNEL assay were used to detect apoptosis. RT-qPCR and western blot were used to detect the gene and protein expression, respectively.  Results:   Our data showed that Enoxacin inhibited PC-3 cell proliferation and induced the apoptosis through up-regulating the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, while down-regulating expression levels of anti-apoptotic proteins.

However, little is known concerning its expression and function in prostate cancer.  Methods:   Paired prostate cancer samples were collected, and the expression levels of BLACAT1, miR-29a-3p and disheveled segment polarity protein 3 (DVL3) were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR); BLACAT1 shRNAs were transfected into PC-3 and LNCaP cell lines, and proliferative ability was detected by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay; qRT-PCR and Western blot were used to analyze the changes of miR-29a-3p and DVL3; dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was used to determine the regulatory relationships between miR-29a-3p and BLACAT1, and miR-29a-3p and DVL3.  Results:   BLACAT1 expression was significantly up-regulated in cancerous tissues of prostate cancer samples and positively correlated with the expression of DVL3, while negatively associated with miR-29a-3p.

The focus of the present paper was to examine the quality of honey from within the vicinity of an abandoned pesticide store in Masindi District in western Uganda. Surficial soils (<20 cm depths) and honey samples were collected from within the vicinity of the abandoned pesticide store and analysed for organochlorine pesticide (OCP) residues using gas chromatograph coupled to an electron capture detector (GC-ECD). The mean level of ∑DDTs in all the soil samples was 503.6 µg/kg dry weight (d.w). ∑DDTs contributed 92.2% to the ∑OCPs contamination loads in the soil samples, and others (lindane, aldrin, dieldrin, and endosulfans) contributed only 7.8%. Ratio (p, p'-DDE+p, p'-DDD)/p, p'-DDT of 1.54 suggested historical DDT input in the area. In all the honey samples, the mean level of ∑DDTs was 20.9 µg/kg. ∑DDTs contributed 43.3% to ∑OCPs contamination loads in the honey samples, followed by lindane (29.8%), endosulfans (23.6%) and dieldrin (3.2%), with corresponding mean levels of 14.4, 11.4 and 1.55 µg/kg, respectively. Reproductive risk assessment was done based on the hazard quotient (HQ) and hazard index (HI) procedure.

However, some patients will experience upgraded pathology and/or stage.  Materials and methods:   We searched a prospectively maintained single institution/multi-surgeon cohort of patients treated by RP and >5-year follow-up.

Results:   Gleason upgrading from ≤3+4 to >3+4 and/or pT3-4 occurred in 17% of pNx and 32% of pN0/N1 (p<0.001). BCR occurred in 5% of the pNx, and 7% of the PLND group. Five-year BCR free survival was higher in the pNx group (94.7% vs. 91%, P = .048). BCR occurred in 3% in the non-pNx regret and 18% in the pNx regret patients. However, with propensity score matching with pNx regret and pN0/N1 patients, 5-year BCR free survival rates were similar (81% vs 77%, P = .466).  Conclusions:   Low to favorable intermediate-risk patients who PLND was omitted and experienced upgrading or upstaging (pNx regret), have a higher predicted BCR.

Results:   Fifty-six respondents participated in this interdisciplinary consensus study (82% urologist, 16% radiologist, 2% radiation oncology).

On another hand, MRI-targeted prostate biopsy is emerging as an alternative to the traditional randomized biopsy, with a higher detection rate of high-grade cancers. However, data on MRI guided in bore biopsy is lacking.  Material and methods:   We reviewed every patient that had his mpMRI, MRI guided in bore biopsy and radical prostatectomy performed in our hospital between November 2015 and December 2020. The diagnostic performances of both mpMRI and MRI targeted biopsy in sampling PIRADS index lesions were studied, using radical prostatectomy specimens as the gold standard. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of mpMRI for detecting T3 stage, extra-capsular extension, seminal vesicles involvement and lymph node disease were also evaluated.  Results:   Sixty-two met our inclusion criteria. For PIRADS≥3 lesions, sensitivity and positive predictive value for detecting clinically significant CaP were of 83.5% and 94.7%. A total of 32.2% prostate cancers on targeted biopsy were upgraded on final pathology, with an upgrading to ISUP≥2 in 3.2% and to ISUP≥3 in 14.5%. A total of 20.9% of cancers were downgraded but without any downgrading to ISUP 1. When final pathology is taken as a gold standard, sensitivity of mpMRI was 31.8% for T3 staging prediction, 30.0% for extra-capsular extension, 28.7% for seminal vesicles involvement and 66.7% for lymph node disease prediction. Specificity was 89.3%, 93.1%, 95.3%, and 92.7%, respectively.

As many parts of our country experience first and second waves of this pandemic, our framework may serve as a resource for other centers experiencing restrictions on the scheduling of elective urologic surgeries.  Methods:   As the COVID-19 pandemic started and peaked in New York, almost all of our scheduled urologic surgeries were cancelled. Each Urologist was asked to rank his/her cancelled surgeries by priority (Level 1-least urgent; Level 2-moderately urgent; Level 3-most urgent). A committee of Urologists assigned a subclass to Level 3 and 2 cases (3a-least urgent; 3b-moderately urgent; 3c-most urgent; 2a-lower priority; 2b-higher priority). The committee then reviewed cases by urgency to derive a final priority ranking.  Results:   A total of 478 total urologic surgeries were canceled and categorized: 250 Level 1, 130 Level 2, 98 Level 3 (73 adult, 25 pediatric). Level 3c involved renal cell carcinoma ≥ T2b, high-grade bladder urothelial carcinoma, adrenal mass/cancer > 6 cm, testicular cancer requiring radical orchiectomy, and penile cancer. Level 3b involved T2a renal masses requiring nephrectomy, while high-risk prostate cancer and symptomatic nephrolithiasis were classified as 3a. Level 2 included testicular cancer requiring retroperitoneal lymph node dissection and complicated benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Results:   A total of 1322 surveys were included in the analysis (1093 breast- and 348 prostate cancer patients). Cronbach's alpha was good (α ≥ 0.7) or acceptable (0.5 ≤ α ≤ 0.7) in 8 out of 9 questionnaire categories, except in the category 'Safety' (α = 0.305). Overall ECCQI scores ranged from 22.1 to 25.1 between countries on a 1-35 scale (categories had a 1-4 scale). In certain subcategories such as 'Organisation' (range 2.2 vs 3.0) and 'Supervision & Support' (range 3.0 vs 3.8) a large difference was observed between countries. Differences in 'Overall opinion' were however small: mean scores of 3.7 vs 3.9, whereas median scores were all the maximum of 4.0. Power distance was positively associated with higher patient satisfaction scores whereas Uncertainty avoidance was negatively associated with these scores. Masculinity was only associated with patient satisfaction scores in lower educated patients. We found the highest impact of culture on overall scores in Hungary and Portugal and the lowest in Romania.  Conclusions:   The ECCQI shows high internal consistency in all categories except 'Safety'. Especially in separate categories and overall ECCQI scores the questionnaire showed discriminative value. This study showed a positive correlation of power distance and a negative correlation for uncertainty avoidance in some countries. When using the ECCQI for international benchmarking these two dimensions of culture should be taken into account.""","""['A Wind#', 'E D Hartman#', 'R R J P Van Eekeren', 'R P W F Wijn', 'J Halámková', 'J Mattson', 'S Siesling', 'W H van Harten']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Piloting a generic cancer consumer quality index in six European countries.', 'Cross-cultural adaptation, reliability and validity of the Spanish version of the Quality of Life in Adult Cancer Survivors (QLACS) questionnaire: application in a sample of short-term survivors.', 'Are cultural dimensions relevant for explaining cross-national differences in antibiotic use in Europe?', 'Patient-reported outcome measures among breast cancer survivors: A cross-sectional comparison between Malaysia and high-income countries.', 'Real-world assessment of the patient-centredness of endometriosis care: European countries benchmarked by patients.']"""

Androgens and the androgen receptor (AR) play predominant roles in the progression of PCa. Neoisoliquiritin (NEO) belongs to the class of licorice (Glycyrrhiza) flavonoids, which have a variety of biological activities including anti-depressant, anti-tumor-promoting, and anti-inflammation properties. Licorice root has cancer chemopreventive effects and has been given to PCa patients as an ingredient of PC-SPES, a commercially available combination of eight herbs. Therefore, we determined if NEO can suppress the proliferation of PCa cells.  Purpose:   We investigated whether and how NEO exerts its anti-neoplastic activity against PCa.  Methods:   The Cell Counting Kit 8 and flow cytometry were used to evaluate the effects of NEO on the proliferation and cell cycle progression of AR-dependent (LNCaP) and AR-independent (PC3) PCa cells. RNA sequencing was employed to examine the genome-wide changes in responsiveness to NEO in LNCaP cells. Quantitative PCR, Western blotting, docking, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and dual-luciferase reporter assays were conducted to determine the mechanism of action of NEO and its potential cross-talk with AR. A LNCaP xenograft nude mouse model was used to determine the inhibitory effects of NEO on AR-dependent PCa tumors in vivo.  Results:   NEO inhibited LNCaP cell proliferation in vitro by inducing G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest. Conversely, NEO treatment had no effect on PC3 cells. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that AR signaling might be the key target of NEO in preventing PCa. NEO regulated AR-mediated cell growth suppression and AR-sensitized cell cycle arrest in LNCaP cells. NEO also blocked several key steps in the AR signaling pathway, including proposed targeting to the ligand binding pocket of AR by computer modeling, modulating AR-androgen response element DNA-binding activity, inhibiting the expression and transcriptional activity of AR, and suppressing downstream AR signaling.  Conclusions:   NEO negatively regulates AR expression and activity, thus supporting the tumor suppressive role for NEO in AR-dependent PCa.""","""['Changbao Chen', 'Rui Shao', 'Bin Li', 'Yu Zhai', 'Taiyi Wang', 'Xin Li', 'Lin Miao', 'Juyang Huang', 'Rui Liu', 'Erwei Liu', 'Yan Zhu', 'Xiumei Gao', 'Han Zhang', 'Yu Wang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Phytomedicine""","""['Evaluation of the effects of androgenic Chinese herbal medicines on androgen receptors and tumor growth in experimental prostate cancer models.', 'Cryptotanshinone suppresses androgen receptor-mediated growth in androgen dependent and castration resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Tanshinones from Chinese medicinal herb Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge) suppress prostate cancer growth and androgen receptor signaling.', 'Androgens as therapy for androgen receptor-positive castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Therapeutic targets and signaling pathways of active components of QiLing decoction against castration-resistant prostate cancer based on network pharmacology.', 'ZIC2 upregulates lncRNA SNHG12 expression to promote endometrial cancer cell proliferation and migration by activating the Notch signaling pathway.']"""

In intermediate-, high- and very-high-risk patients, testosterone and PSA levels both increased following the termination of CAB after IGPT, and the average EHS increased. The sexual domain summary score gradually increased, but not above minimally important differences.

Despite attempts to translate findings to humans, gaps remain in understanding pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relations and how tissue concentrations affect efficacy. Such information is necessary for dose selection and is particularly important given the low bioavailability of resveratrol.  Objectives:   This study aimed to determine concentrations of resveratrol in prostate tissue of men after a dietary-achievable (5 mg) or pharmacological (1 g) dose. We then examined whether clinically relevant concentrations of resveratrol/its metabolites had direct anticancer activity in prostate cell lines.  Methods:   A window trial was performed in which patients were allocated to 5 mg or 1 g resveratrol daily, or no intervention, before prostate biopsy. Patients (10/group) ingested resveratrol capsules for 7-14 d before biopsy, with the last dose [14C]-labeled, allowing detection of resveratrol species in prostate tissue using accelerator MS. Cellular uptake and antiproliferative properties of resveratrol/metabolites were assessed in cancer and nonmalignant cell cultures using HPLC with UV detection and cell counting, respectively.  Results:   [14C]-Resveratrol species were detectable in prostate tissue of all patients analyzed, with mean ± SD concentrations of 0.08 ± 0.04 compared with 22.1 ± 8.2 pmol/mg tissue for the 5 mg and the 1 g dose, respectively. However, total [14C]-resveratrol equivalents in prostate were lower than we previously reported in plasma and colorectum after identical doses. Furthermore, resveratrol was undetectable in prostate tissue; instead, sulfate and glucuronide metabolites dominated. Although resveratrol reduced prostate cell numbers in vitro over 7 d, the concentrations required (≥10 µM) exceeded the plasma maximum concentration. Resveratrol mono-sulfates and glucuronides failed to consistently inhibit cell growth, partly due to poor cellular uptake.  Conclusions:   Low tissue concentrations of resveratrol species, coupled with weak antiproliferative activity of its conjugates, suggest daily doses of ≤1 g may not have direct effects on human prostate.This trial was registered at clinicaltrialsregister.eu as EudraCT 2007-002131-91.""","""['Hong Cai', 'Edwina N Scott', 'Robert G Britton', 'Emma Parrott', 'Ted J Ognibene', 'Michael Malfatti', 'Masood Khan', 'William P Steward', 'Karen Brown']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Am J Clin Nutr""","""['Pharmacokinetics, oral bioavailability, and metabolic profile of resveratrol and its dimethylether analog, pterostilbene, in rats.', 'Folic acid supplementation and malaria susceptibility and severity among people taking antifolate antimalarial drugs in endemic areas.', 'Resveratrol-loaded nanomedicines for cancer applications.', 'Determination of resveratrol and its sulfate and glucuronide metabolites in plasma by LC-MS/MS and their pharmacokinetics in dogs.', 'Resveratrol - A comprehensive review of recent advances in anticancer drug design and development.']"""

Results:   The median interassay CV for tPSA MSs (11.5%; 25-75th percentiles, 9.2-13.4) fulfilled the minimum APS goal for intermethod bias (15.9%), while the interassay CV for fPSA did not [20.4% (25-75th percentiles, 18.4-22.7) vs goal 17.6%].

Its heterogeneity challenges the identification of crucial driver genes implicated in disease progression. Activating protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor is associated with cancer since the first identification of its subunits, the proto-oncogenes JUN and FOS. Whereas both JUN and FOS have been implicated in prostate cancer, this study provides the first functional evidence that FOS acts as a tumor suppressor during prostate cancer progression and invasion. Data mining revealed decreased FOS expression in prostate cancer and a further downregulation in metastatic disease, consistent with FOS expression in cell lines derived from different prostate cancer stages. FOS deficiency in prostate cancer cell lines increases cell proliferation and induces oncogenic pathway alterations. Importantly, in vivo CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Fos and Pten double mutation in murine prostate epithelium results in increased proliferation and invasiveness compared to the abrogation of Pten alone. Interestingly, enhanced Jun expression is observed in the murine prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia lacking Fos. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of Jun combined with Fos and Pten deficiency diminishes the increased proliferation rate in vivo but not the ability to form invasive disease.

Although cancer epidemiology in Brazil is well described through incidence and mortality estimate in the general population, cancer estimates among indigenous peoples are still unknown.  Design:   This is a descriptive study of cancer incidence among the indigenous population (2000-2012) in the State of Acre, Brazil. The sources used were population-based cancer registries of Goiânia, hospital-based cancer registry of Acre, São Paulo, and Porto Velho; Special Indigenous Health Districts databases of Acre, Goiânia, and São Paulo; Mortality Information System, and Rio Branco's public and private laboratories' reports. Standardized Incidence Ratio (SIR) was calculated using cancer incidence rates of Goiânia as reference.  Results:   From 137 cancer cases, 51.8% occurred in women and 32.1% in people aged 70 + . Among men, the most frequent cancer sites were stomach (25.8%), liver (15.1%), colorectal (7.6%), leukemia (7.6%), and prostate (6.1%). Among women, the most frequent were cervical (50.7%), stomach (8.5%), leukemia (5.6%), liver (4.3%), and breast (4.3%). Among men, there was an excess of cancer cases for stomach (SIR=1.75; 95%CI:1.67-1.83), liver (SIR=1.77; 95%CI:1.66-1.88), and leukemia (SIR=1.64; 95%CI:1.49-1.78). In women, an excess of cancer cases was observed for cervical (SIR=4.49; 95%CI:4.34-4.64) and liver (SIR=2.11; 95%CI:1.88-2.34). A lower cancer incidence for prostate (SIR=0.06; 95%CI:0.05-0.07) and female breast (SIR=0.12; 95%CI:0.11-0.14) was observed.  Conclusions:   Cervical, stomach, and liver cancers corresponded to 52% of the cases and were highly incident among the Brazilian indigenous population of Western Amazon compared to non-indigenous counterparts.

Incomplete understanding of the mechanism has hindered its development as an anti-tumorigenic compound. We have identified for the first-time macrophage stimulatory protein 1 receptor (MST1R) as a potential target of 2-ME2 in prostate cancer cells. Human tissue validation studies show that MST1R (a.k.a RON) protein levels are significantly elevated in prostate cancer tissues compared to adjacent normal/benign glands. Serum levels of macrophage stimulatory protein (MSP), a ligand for RON, is not only associated with the risk of disease recurrence, but also significantly elevated in samples from African American patients. 2-ME2 treatment inhibited mechanical properties such as adhesion and elasticity that are associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition by downregulating mRNA expression and protein levels of MST1R in prostate cancer cell lines. Intervention with 2-ME2 significantly reduced tumor burden in mice. Notably, global metabolomic profiling studies identified significantly higher circulating levels of bile acids in castrated animals that were decreased with 2-ME2 intervention. In summary, findings presented in this manuscript identified MSP as a potential marker for predicting biochemical recurrence and suggest repurposing 2-ME2 to target RON signaling may be a potential therapeutic modality for prostate cancer.""","""['Izhar Singh Batth', 'Shih-Bo Huang', 'Michelle Villarreal', 'Jingjing Gong', 'Divya Chakravarthy', 'Brian Keppler', 'Sridharan Jayamohan', 'Pawel Osmulski', 'Jianping Xie', 'Paul Rivas', 'Roble Bedolla', 'Michael A Liss', 'I-Tien Yeh', 'Robert Reddick', 'Hiroshi Miyamoto', 'Rita Ghosh', 'Addanki P Kumar']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Involvement of FLIP in 2-methoxyestradiol-induced tumor regression in transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate model.', 'Crosstalk between RON and androgen receptor signaling in the development of castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Prostate Epithelial RON Signaling Promotes M2 Macrophage Activation to Drive Prostate Tumor Growth and Progression.', 'The macrophage stimulating protein/Ron pathway as a potential therapeutic target to impede multiple mechanisms involved in breast cancer progression.', 'The ron receptor tyrosine kinase: a key regulator of inflammation and cancer progression.', 'Macrophage-Colony-Stimulating Factor Receptor Enhances Prostate Cancer Cell Growth and Aggressiveness In Vitro and In Vivo and Increases Osteopontin Expression.', 'Preparation of 2-Methoxyestradiol Self-emulsified Drug Delivery System and the Effect on Combination Therapy with Doxorubicin Against MCF-7/ADM Cells.', 'SIRT1 inhibition-induced senescence as a strategy to prevent prostate cancer progression.']"""

In the present paper, we aimed to better stratify prostate cancer patients through the selection of robust long non-coding RNAs. To fulfill the purpose of the study, a bioinformatic approach focused on feature selection applied to a TCGA dataset was used. In such a way, LINC00668 and long non-coding(lnc)-SAYSD1-1, able to discriminate ERG/not-ERG subtypes, were demonstrated to be positive prognostic biomarkers in ERG-positive patients. Furthermore, we performed a comparison between mutated prostate cancer, identified as ""classified"", and a group of patients with no peculiar genomic alteration, named ""not-classified"". Moreover, LINC00920 lncRNA overexpression has been linked to a better outcome of the hormone regimen. Through the feature selection approach, it was found that the overexpression of lnc-ZMAT3-3 is related to low-grade patients, and three lncRNAs: lnc-SNX10-87, lnc-AP1S2-2, and ADPGK-AS1 showed, through a co-expression analysis, significant correlation values with potentially druggable pathways.

We applied two-sample Mendelian randomization to investigate whether genetically raised bilirubin levels are causally associated with the risk of ten cancers (pancreas, kidney, endometrium, ovary, breast, prostate, lung, Hodgkin's lymphoma, melanoma, and neuroblastoma). The number of cases and their matched controls of European descent ranged from 122,977 and 105,974 for breast cancer to 1200 and 6417 for Hodgkin's lymphoma, respectively. A total of 115 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated (p < 5 × 10-8) with circulating total bilirubin, extracted from a genome-wide association study in the UK Biobank, were used as instrumental variables. One SNP (rs6431625) in the promoter region of the uridine-diphosphoglucuronate glucuronosyltransferase1A1 (UGT1A1) gene explained 16.9% and the remaining 114 SNPs (non-UGT1A1 SNPs) explained 3.1% of phenotypic variance in circulating bilirubin levels. A one-standarddeviation increment in circulating bilirubin (≈ 4.4 µmol/L), predicted by non-UGT1A1 SNPs, was inversely associated with risk of squamous cell lung cancer and Hodgkin's lymphoma (odds ratio (OR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73-0.99, P 0.04 and OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.42-0.99, p 0.04, respectively), which was confirmed after removing potential pleiotropic SNPs. In contrast, a positive association was observed with the risk of breast cancer after removing potential pleiotropic SNPs (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.04-1.20, p 0.002). There was little evidence for robust associations with the other seven cancers investigated.

Here, we applied the Robust Rank Aggregation (RRA) method to PCa transcriptome profiles and identified 287 genes differentially expressed between localized castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) and hormone-sensitive PCa (HSPC). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and stepwise Cox regression analyses of the 287 genes developed a 6-gene signature predictive of RFS in PCa. This signature included NPEPL1, VWF, LMO7, ALDH2, NUAK1, and TPT1, and was named CRPC-derived prognosis signature (CRPCPS). Interestingly, three of these 6 genes constituted another signature capable of distinguishing CRPC from HSPC. The CRPCPS predicted RFS in 5/9 cohorts in the multivariate analysis and remained valid in patients stratified by tumor stage, Gleason score, and lymph node status. The signature also predicted overall survival and metastasis-free survival. The signature's robustness was demonstrated by the C-index (0.55-0.74) and the calibration plot in all nine cohorts and the 3-, 5-, and 8-year area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.67-0.77) in three cohorts.

It is known that β1-integrin stimulates invadopodia function through an invadopodial p(T567)-ezrin/NHERF1/NHE1 signal complex that regulates NHE1-driven invadopodia proteolytic activity and invasion. However, the link between β1-integrin and this signaling complex is unknown. In this study, in metastatic breast (MDA-MB-231) and prostate (PC-3) cancer cells, we report that integrin-linked kinase (ILK) integrates β1-integrin with this signaling complex to regulate invadopodia activity and invasion. Proximity ligation assay experiments demonstrate that, in invadopodia, ILK associates with β1-integrin, NHE1 and the scaffold proteins p(T567)-ezrin and NHERF1. Activation of β1-integrin increased both invasion and invadopodia activity, which were specifically blocked by inhibition of either NHE1 or ILK.

Mechanisms leading to the homing of tumor cells to bone remain poorly characterized. Role of chemokines in providing navigational cues to migrating cancer cells bearing specific receptors is well established. Bone is an adipocyte-rich organ since 50 to 70% of the adult bone marrow (BM) volume comprise bone marrow adipocytes (BM-Ads), which are likely to produce chemokines within the bone microenvironment. Using in vitro migration assays, we demonstrated that soluble factors released by human primary BM-Ads are able to support the directed migration of PCa cells in a CCR3-dependent manner. In addition, we showed that CCL7, a chemokine previously involved in the CCR3-dependent migration of PCa cells outside of the prostate gland, is released by human BM-Ads. These effects are amplified by obesity and ageing, two clinical conditions known to promote aggressive and metastatic PCa. In human tumors, we found an enrichment of CCR3 in bone metastasis vs. primary tumors at mRNA levels using Oncomine microarray database.

A unique tripartite CTV ""theranostic"" adenovirus (TCTV) has now been created that employs three distinct promoters to target virus replication, cytokine production and imaging capabilities uniquely in cancer cells. Conditional replication of the TCTV is regulated by a cancer-selective (truncated PEG-3) promoter, the therapeutic component, MDA-7/IL-24, is under a ubiquitous (CMV) promoter, and finally the imaging capabilities are synchronized through another cancer selective (truncated tCCN1) promoter. Using in vitro studies and clinically relevant in vivo models of breast and prostate cancer, we demonstrate that incorporating a reporter gene for imaging does not compromise the exceptional therapeutic efficacy of our previously reported bipartite CTV.

Active fraction 4 was further analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight-mass spectrometry analysis to identify its active constituents. Among the compounds that were responsible for the cytotoxic effects of this fraction were flavonoids, phenolic acids, and aromatic compounds, of which p-coumaric acid (p-CA) and its derivatives were abundant. To understand the mechanisms that underlie p-CA cytotoxicity, a microarray assay was performed on PC3 cells that were treated or not with this compound. The results showed that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) that regulate many cancer-related pathways were targeted by p-CA, which could be related to the reported effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS). A molecular docking study of p-CA showed that this phenolic acid targeted these protein active sites (MAPK8 and Serine/Threonine protein kinase 3) at the same binding site as their inhibitors. Thus, we hypothesize that p-CA produces ROS, directly affects the MAPK signaling pathway, and consequently causes apoptosis, among other effects.

[18F]PSMA-1007, a radiopharmaceutical labeled with fluorine-18, has excellent properties for the detection of prostate cancer. Essential for the human use of a radiotracer is its production and quality control under GMP-compliance. For this purpose, all analytical methods have to be validated. [18F]PSMA-1007 is easily radiosynthesized in a one-step procedure and isolated using solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges followed by formulation of a buffered injection solution and for the determination of its chemical and radiochemical purity a robust, fast and reliable quality control method using radio-HPLC is necessary. After development and optimizations overcoming problems in reproducibility, the here described radio-HPLC method fulfills all acceptance criteria-for e.g., specificity, linearity, and accuracy-and is therefore well suited for the routine quality control of [18F]PSMA-1007 before release of the radiopharmaceutical. Recently a European Pharmacopeia monograph for [18F]PSMA-1007 was published suggesting a different radio-HPLC method for the determination of its chemical and radiochemical purity. Since the here described method has certain advantages, not least of all easier technical implementation, it can be an attractive alternative to the monograph method. The here described method was successfully validated on several radio-HPLC systems in our lab and used for the analysis of more than 60 batches of [18F]PSMA-1007. Using this method, the chemical and radiochemical purity of [18F]PSMA-1007 can routinely be evaluated assuring patient safety.""","""['Ines Katzschmann', 'Heike Marx', 'Klaus Kopka', 'Ute Hennrich']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Pharmaceuticals (Basel)""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Development and Validation of a High-Pressure Liquid Chromatography Method for the Determination of Chemical Purity and Radiochemical Purity of a 68Ga-Labeled Glu-Urea-Lys(Ahx)-HBED-CC (Positron Emission Tomography) Tracer.', 'Validation of HPLC method for the determination of chemical andradiochemical purity of a 68Ga-labelled EuK-Sub-kf-(3-iodo-y-) DOTAGA.', '68Ga-prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography for Prostate Cancer Imaging: A Narrative Literature Review.', 'New Clinical Indications for (18)F/(11)C-choline, New Tracers for Positron Emission Tomography and a Promising Hybrid Device for Prostate Cancer Staging: A Systematic Review of the Literature.', 'Quality control of 177LuLu-PSMA preparations using HPLC: effect of sample composition and ligand on recovery.', 'Development and Validation of Analytical Methods for Radiochemical Purity of 177Lu-PSMA-1.', 'On site production of 18FPSMA-1007 using different 18Ffluoride activities: practical, technical and economical impact.']"""

We were interested in investigating epigenomic alterations associated with T2E+ PCa. Using different sequencing cohorts, we found several transcripts of the miR-449 cluster to be repressed in T2E+ PCa. This repression correlated strongly with enhanced expression of NOTCH and several of its target genes in TCGA and ICGC PCa RNA-seq data. We corroborated these findings using a cellular model with inducible T2E expression. Overexpression of miR-449a in vitro led to silencing of genes associated with NOTCH signaling (NOTCH1, HES1) and HDAC1. Interestingly, HDAC1 overexpression led to the repression of HES6, a negative regulator of the transcription factor HES1, the primary effector of NOTCH signaling, and promoted cell proliferation by repressing the cell cycle inhibitor p21. Inhibition of NOTCH as well as knockdown of HES1 reduced the oncogenic properties of PCa cell lines. Using tissue microarray analysis encompassing 533 human PCa cores, ERG-positive areas exhibited significantly increased HES1 expression.

This study assesses the clinical utility of deep learning-based autosegmentation for MR-based prostate radiotherapy planning.  Materials and methods:   Data was collected prospectively for patients undergoing prostate-only radiation at our institution from June to December 2019. Geometric indices (volumetric Dice-Sørensen Coefficient, VDSC; surface Dice-Sørensen Coefficient, SDSC; added path length, APL) compared automated to final contours. Physicians reported contouring time and rated autocontours on 3-point protocol deviation scales. Descriptive statistics and univariable analyses evaluated relationships between the aforementioned metrics.  Results:   Among 173 patients, 85% received SBRT. The CTV was available for 167 (97%) with median VDSC, SDSC, and APL for CTV (prostate and SV) 0.89 (IQR 0.83-0.95), 0.91 (IQR 0.75-0.96), and 1801 mm (IQR 1140-2703), respectively. Physicians completed surveys for 43/55 patients (RR 78%). 33% of autocontours (14/43) required major ""clinically significant"" edits. Physicians spent a median of 28 min contouring (IQR 20-30), representing a 12-minute (30%) time savings compared to historic controls (median 40, IQR 25-68, n = 21, p < 0.01). Geometric indices correlated weakly with contouring time, and had no relationship with quality scores.  Conclusion:   Deep learning-based autosegmentation was implemented successfully and improved efficiency. Major ""clinically significant"" edits are uncommon and do not correlate with geometric indices. APL was supported as a clinically meaningful quantitative metric.

We compared clinical characteristics and outcomes between NMIBC patients with and without previous non-urothelial malignant history and investigated whether smoking status and treatment modality for previous cancer affected NMIBC outcomes.  Results:   A total of 177 patients (16.1%) had previous non-urothelial malignant history (malignant history group).

In a subgroup of patients who were current smokers (N = 347), previous non-urothelial malignant history was associated with tumor recurrence and stage progression. In contrast, previous non-urothelial malignant history was not associated with tumor recurrence or stage progression in ex-smokers or non-smokers.

On the basis of previous phase I and phase II studies, we investigated whether the association of curcumin with docetaxel could improve prognosis among mCRPC patients.  Methods:   A total of 50 mCRPC patients (included from June 2014 to July 2016) treated with docetaxel in association with oral curcumin (6 g/d for 7 days every 3 weeks) versus placebo were included in this double-blind, randomized, phase II study. The primary endpoint was to evaluate the time to progression. Among the secondary endpoints, compliance, overall survival, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, safety, curcumin absorption, and quality of life were investigated. An interim analysis was planned in the modified intention-to-treat population with data at 6 months (22 patients per arm).  Results:   Despite good compliance and a verified absorption of curcumin, no difference was shown for our primary endpoint: progression-free survival (PFS) between the placebo and curcumin groups was, respectively, 5.3 months versus 3.7 months, p = 0.75. Similarly, no difference was observed for the secondary objectives: PSA response rate (p = 0.88), overall survival (p = 0.50), and quality of life (p = 0.49 and p = 0.47).  Conclusion:   Even though our previous studies and data in the literature seemed to support an association between curcumin and cancer therapies in order to improve patient outcome and prognosis, the results from this interim analysis clearly showed that adding curcumin to mCRPC patients' treatment strategies was not efficacious.

We aimed to assess prostate cancer staging practice patterns in Australia using population-based data.  Subject and methods:   We extracted data on men diagnosed with prostate cancer between October 2016 and December 2018 from the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Registry-Victoria (PCOR-Vic). We evaluated trends and comparisons between patients receiving PET/CT (with or without conventional imaging (CImg)), and CImg alone, and analysed imaging modality as predictor of clinical regional node positive disease (cN1 vs cN0/X), metastatic disease (cM1 vs cM0/X), and treatment received.  Results:   In total, 6139 patients in the registry had either a staging PET scan (n = 889, 14%), CImg without PET scan (n = 2464, 40%), or no recorded PET or CImg (n = 2786, 45%). The proportion of allimaged patients who received staging PET increased from 19% to 36% from the first to last three-month period, and in the high-risk category the increase was 23-43%.

Methods:   We relied on surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (2004-2016) to identify all salvage radical prostatectomy patients. Categorical, as well as univariate and multivariate Cox regression models tested the effect of LND (LND performed vs. not), as well as at its extent (log-transformed lymph node count) on CSM.  Results:   Of 427 salvage radical prostatectomy patients, 120 (28.1%) underwent LND with a median lymph node count of 6 (interquartile range [IQR], 3-11). According to LND status, no significant or clinically meaningful differences were recorded in PSA at diagnosis, stage and biopsy Gleason score at diagnosis, except for age at prostate cancer diagnosis (LND performed 63 vs. 68 years LND not performed, p < .001). LND status (performed) was an independent predictor of lower CSM (hazard ratio [HR] 0.47; p = .03). Similarly, lymph node count (log transformed) also independently predicted lower CSM (HR: 0.60; p = .01). After the 7th removed lymph node, the effect of CSM became marginal. The effect of N-stage on CSM could not be tested due to insufficient number of observations.  Conclusions:   Salvage radical prostatectomy is rarely performed and LND at salvage radical prostatectomy is performed in a minority of patients. However, LND at salvage radical prostatectomy is associated with lower CSM. Moreover, LND extent also exerts a protective effect on CSM.

The View of Physicians""","""Former research has identified stigmatizing attitudes toward cancer patients in the general population. Little is known about (implicit) attitudes of physicians toward cancer patients. By using the prototype approach, the study investigated German physicians' prototypical perceptions of cancer patients. Five hundred nineteen physicians (mean age: 46 years, 47% female) who regularly treat cancer patients participated in the questionnaire study. Participants were asked to state three prototype attributes that describe the ""typical cancer patient."" Open format answers were coded on the dimensions favorability (coded with unfavorable, favorable, or neutral) and gender-stereotypicality (coded with masculine stereotypical, feminine stereotypical, or gender-neutral). Of all prototype attributes (N = 1,589), 69.9% were coded as unfavorable and 14.3% as favorable, the remaining attributes were neutral (15.9%). Analysis of gender-stereotypicality revealed that nearly half of the attributes (49.5%) were compatible with the feminine, whereas only 6.5% were compatible with the masculine stereotype. The remaining attributes (44.0%) were gender-neutral. There were no significant associations between prototype favorability or gender-stereotypicality and demographic/professional characteristics of physicians. The prototype approach was successful to identify (implicit) attitudes toward cancer patients and might be more sensitive than social distance scales when investigating stigmatizing attitudes. Physicians described the ""typical cancer patient"" with predominantly unfavorable and feminine attributes, while favorable attributes were underrepresented and positive masculine attributes were barely mentioned. The finding that the ""typical cancer patient"" lacks (positive) masculine attributes should be followed up in further research.""","""['Angeliki Tsiouris', 'Nadine Ungar', 'Martina Gabrian', 'Alexander Haussmann', 'Karen Steindorf', 'Joachim Wiskemann', 'Monika Sieverding']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Am J Mens Health""","""['Current gender stereotypes and their evaluative content.', 'Attitudes toward homosexuality and femininity in men.', 'Conceptions of masculinity and femininity as a basis for stereotypes of male and female homosexuals.', 'Gender identity and its implications for the concepts of masculinity and femininity.', 'Gender role affects experimental pain responses: a systematic review with meta-analysis.']"""

Design:   Individual patient data record linkage study.  Setting, participants:   4003 New South Wales men aged 45 years or more enrolled in the population-based 45 and Up Study in whom prostate cancer was first diagnosed during 2006-2013.  Main outcome measures:   Prostate cancer treatment type received; factors statistically associated with treatment received; proportions of patients who consulted radiation oncologists prior to treatment.  Results:   In total, 1619 of 4003 patients underwent radical prostatectomy (40%), 893 external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) (22%), 183 brachytherapy (5%), 87 chemotherapy (2%), 373 androgen deprivation therapy alone (9%), and 848 no active treatment (21%). 205 of 1628 patients who had radical prostatectomies (13%) had radiation oncology consultations prior to surgery. Radical prostatectomy was more likely for patients aged 45-59 years, with regional stage disease, living 100 km or more from the nearest radiotherapy centre, having partners, or having private health insurance, while lower physical functioning, obesity, and living in areas of greater socio-economic disadvantage reduced the likelihood. EBRT was more likely for patients aged 70-79 years, with non-localised or unknown stage disease, living less than 100 km from the nearest radiotherapy centre, or not having private health insurance, while the likelihood was lower for patients aged 45-59 years or more than 80 years and for those who had several comorbid conditions.  Conclusions:   Men with prostate cancer were twice as likely to have radical prostatectomy as to receive EBRT, and fewer than one in seven had consulted radiation oncologists prior to prostatectomy. The treatment received was influenced by several socio-demographic factors.

Arginine-deprivation therapy has gained increasing attention in recent years. One challenge of ADI-PEG20 (pegylated ADI) therapy is the development of drug resistance caused by restoration of ASS1 expression and other factors. The goal of this work is to identify novel factors conferring therapy resistance. Methods: Multiple, independently derived ADI-resistant clones including derivatives of breast (MDA-MB-231 and BT-549) and prostate (PC3, CWR22Rv1, and DU145) cancer cells were developed. RNA-seq and RT-PCR were used to identify genes upregulated in the resistant clones. Unbiased genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screening was used to identify genes whose absence confers sensitivity to these cells. shRNA and CRISPR/Cas9 knockout as well as overexpression approaches were used to validate the functions of the resistant genes both in vitro and in xenograft models. The signal pathways were verified by western blotting and cytokine release. Results: Based on unbiased CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screening and RNA-seq analyses of independently derived ADI-resistant (ADIR) clones, aberrant activation of the TREM1/CCL2 axis in addition to ASS1 expression was consistently identified as the resistant factors. Unlike ADIR, MDA-MB-231 overexpressing ASS1 cells achieved only moderate ADI resistance both in vitro and in vivo, and overexpression of ASS1 alone does not activate the TREM1/CCL2 axis. These data suggested that upregulation of TREM1 is an independent factor in the development of strong resistance, which is accompanied by activation of the AKT/mTOR/STAT3/CCL2 pathway and contributes to cell survival and overcoming the tumor suppressive effects of ASS1 overexpression. Importantly, knockdown of TREM1 or CCL2 significantly sensitized ADIR toward ADI. Similar results were obtained in BT-549 breast cancer cell line as well as castration-resistant prostate cancer cells. The present study sheds light on the detailed mechanisms of resistance to arginine-deprivation therapy and uncovers novel targets to overcome resistance.

Oncological results and clinical value in symptom control and primary lesion treatment were compared.  Results:   Fifty-four patients were included in each group. Prostate cryoablation was well tolerated. The median follow-up time was 40 (27-53) and 39 (31-54) months in group A and group B, respectively.

Since enzalutamide is innovated and approved by US FDA as a new treatment option for mCRPC patients, drug resistance for enzalutamide is a critical issue during clinical usage. Although several underlying mechanisms causing enzalutamide resistance were previously identified, most of them revealed that drug resistant cells are still highly addicted to androgen and AR functions. Due to the numerous physical functions of AR in men, innovated AR-independent therapy might alleviate enzalutamide resistance and prevent production of adverse side effects. Here, we have identified that yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) is overexpressed in enzalutamide-resistant (EnzaR) cells. Furthermore, enzalutamide-induced YAP1 expression is mediated through the function of chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor 2 (COUP-TFII) at the transcriptional and the post-transcriptional levels. Functional analyses reveal that YAP1 positively regulates numerous genes related to cancer stemness and lipid metabolism and interacts with COUP-TFII to form a transcriptional complex. More importantly, YAP1 inhibitor attenuates the growth and cancer stemness of EnzaR cells in vitro and in vivo. Finally, YAP1, COUP-TFII, and miR-21 are detected in the extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from EnzaR cells and sera of patients. In addition, treatment with EnzaR-EVs induces the abilities of cancer stemness, lipid metabolism and enzalutamide resistance in its parental cells.

Herein, we optimised a microwell platform, the Microwell-mesh, to aggregate precise numbers of cells into arrays of microtissues, and then implanted the Microwell-mesh into NOD-scid IL2γ-/- (NSG) mice to study microtissue growth. First, mesh pore size was optimised using microtissues assembled from bone marrow-derived stromal cells, with mesh opening dimensions of 100×100 μm achieving superior microtissue vascularisation relative to mesh with 36×36 μm mesh openings. The optimised Microwell-mesh was used to assemble and implant PCa cell microtissue arrays (hereafter microtissues formed from cancer cells are referred to as microtumours) into mice. PCa cells were enriched from three different PDX lines, LuCaP35, LuCaP141, and BM18. 3D microtumours showed greater in vitro viability than 2D cultures, but neither proliferated. Microtumours were successfully established in mice 81% (57 of 70), 67% (4 of 6), 76% (19 of 25) for LuCaP35, LuCaP141, and BM18 PCa cells, respectively. Microtumour growth was tracked using live animal imaging for size or bioluminescence signal. If augmented with further imaging advances and cell bar coding, this microtumour model could enable greater resolution of PCa PDX drug response, and lead to the more efficient use of animals. The concept of microtissue assembly in the Microwell-mesh, and implantation in vivo may also have utility in implantation of islets, hair follicles or other organ-specific cells that self-assemble into 3D structures, providing an important bridge between in vitro assembly of mini-organs and in vivo implantation.""","""['Melissa E Monterosso', 'Kathryn Futrega', 'William B Lott', 'Ian Vela', 'Elizabeth D Williams', 'Michael R Doran']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['The microwell-mesh: A novel device and protocol for the high throughput manufacturing of cartilage microtissues.', 'Using high throughput microtissue culture to study the difference in prostate cancer cell behavior and drug response in 2D and 3D co-cultures.', 'Bone marrow-derived stem/stromal cells (BMSC) 3D microtissues cultured in BMP-2 supplemented osteogenic induction medium are prone to adipogenesis.', 'Scaffold-free microtissues: differences from monolayer cultures and their potential in bone tissue engineering.', 'Application of Prostate Cancer Models for Preclinical Study: Advantages and Limitations of Cell Lines, Patient-Derived Xenografts, and Three-Dimensional Culture of Patient-Derived Cells.', 'Method for manufacture and cryopreservation of cartilage microtissues.', 'The future of patient-derived xenografts in prostate cancer research.']"""

It is necessary to differentiate between benign and malignant prostate conditions to give accurate diagnoses. We aim to demonstrate the use of a 3D Mueller matrix method to allow quick and easy clinical differentiation between prostate adenoma and carcinoma tissues with different grades and Gleason scores. Histological sections of benign and malignant prostate tumours, obtained by radical prostatectomy, were investigated. We map the degree of depolarisation in the different prostate tumour tissues using a Mueller matrix polarimeter set-up, based on the superposition of a reference laser beam with the interference pattern of the sample in the image plane. The depolarisation distributions can be directly related to the morphology of the biological tissues. The dependences of the magnitude of the 1st to 4th order statistical moments of the depolarisation distribution are determined, which characterise the distributions of the depolarisation values. To determine the diagnostic potential of the method three groups of histological sections of prostate tumour biopsies were formed. The first group contained 36 adenoma tissue samples, while the second contained 36 carcinoma tissue samples of a high grade (grade 4: poorly differentiated-4 + 4 Gleason score), and the third group contained 36 carcinoma tissue samples of a low grade (grade 1: moderately differentiated-3 + 3 Gleason score). Using the calculated values of the statistical moments, tumour tissues are categorised as either adenoma or carcinoma. A high level (> 90%) accuracy of differentiation between adenoma and carcinoma samples was achieved for each group. Differentiation between the high-grade and low-grade carcinoma samples was achieved with an accuracy of 87.5%. The results demonstrate that Mueller matrix mapping of the depolarisation distribution of prostate tumour tissues can accurately differentiate between adenoma and carcinoma, and between different grades of carcinoma. This represents a first step towards the implementation of 3D Mueller matrix mapping for clinical analysis and diagnosis of prostate tumours.""","""['Volodymyr A Ushenko', 'Benjamin T Hogan', 'Alexander Dubolazov', 'Gennadii Piavchenko', 'Sergey L Kuznetsov', 'Alexander G Ushenko', 'Yuriy O Ushenko', 'Mykhailo Gorsky', 'Alexander Bykov', 'Igor Meglinski']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Increasing the number of biopsies increases the concordance of Gleason scores of needle biopsies and prostatectomy specimens.', 'Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'Gleason scores from prostate biopsies obtained with 18-gauge biopsy needles poorly predict Gleason scores of radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'The ability of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density to predict an upgrade in Gleason score between initial prostate biopsy and prostatectomy diminishes with increasing tumour grade due to reduced PSA secretion per unit tumour volume.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.', 'Optical anisotropy composition of benign and malignant prostate tissues revealed by Mueller-matrix imaging.', 'Mueller Matrix Microscopy for In Vivo Scar Tissue Diagnostics and Treatment Evaluation.', 'Recombinant Spidroin Microgel as the Base of Cell-Engineered Constructs Mediates Liver Regeneration in Rats.', 'Differentiation of Human GBM From Non-GBM Brain Tissue With Polarization Imaging Technique.', 'Polarization memory rate as a metric to differentiate benign and malignant tissues.']"""

This study evaluated the potential synergy of immunotherapy and enzalutamide (without ADT) in nmCSPC. In addition, the immunologic impact of enzalutamide was also evaluated in men with normal testosterone.  Methods:   Patients with rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after definitive therapy, normal testosterone and no radiographic metastasis were randomized to enzalutamide for 3 months with/without PROSTVAC for 6 months. Thereafter, patients could be retreated with another 3 month course of enzalutamide when PSA returned to baseline. Immune profiles were evaluated in these patients.  Results:   Thirty-eight patients were randomized with a median PSA=4.38 ng/dL and PSA doubling time=4.1 months. No difference was observed between the two groups for PSA growth kinetics, but PSA responses to enzalutamide were noteworthy regardless of PROSTVAC. The median PSA decline after short-course enzalutamide without ADT/testosterone lowering therapy was 99% in both courses. The median time to PSA recovery to baseline after each 84-day course of enzalutamide was also noteworthy because of the duration of response after enzalutamide was discontinued. After the first and second 3 month cycle of enzalutamide, PSA recovery to baseline took a median 224 (range 84-1246) and 189 days (78-400), respectively. The most common adverse events related to the enzalutamide were grade 1 fatigue (71%) and grade 1 breast pain/nipple tenderness (81%). The only grade 3 toxicity was aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation in two patients. Enzalutamide was independently associated with immune changes, increasing natural killer cells, naïve-T cells, and decreasing myeloid-derived suppressor cells.  Conclusions:   Three months of enzalutamide without ADT induced substantial PSA control beyond the treatment period and was repeatable, perhaps representing an alternative to intermittent ADT in nmCSPC. In addition, enzalutamide was associated with immune changes that could be relevant as future immune combinations are developed.

Robot-assisted RP (RARP) has become the predominant surgical management for localized prostate cancer in the United States but contemporary national data on PLND adherence during RARP are still lacking.  Methods:   RARPs for clinically localized (cT1-2N0M0) intermediate-risk and high-risk prostate cancer diagnosed between 2010 and 2016 in National Cancer Database were identified. Outcome of interest was PLND and multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify whether patient demographics and facility characteristics were associated with the outcome.  Results:   We included 115,355 patients in the final cohort (intermediate-risk = 86,314, high-risk = 29,041). From 2010 to 2016, there was an increasing trend of PLND in the overall, intermediate-risk, and high-risk cohorts. In 2016, PLND was performed in 79.7% of the intermediate-risk and 93.5% of the high-risk patients. Multivariable logistic regressions showed Hispanic race/ethnicity (vs. white) (odds ratio [OR] = 0.90, P = .010), lowest socioeconomic status (vs. highest) (OR = 0.85, P < .001), rural area (vs. metro area) (OR=0.61, P < .001), and community facility (vs. academic) (OR = 0.56, P < .001) were some of the factors associated with lower PLND rate. Variations of PLND rate among reporting facility's locations were also identified.  Conclusion:   Contemporary national data showed significantly increased PLND rate in patients who underwent RARP for intermediate-risk and high-risk prostate cancer in recent years. However, there were still some variations in PLND rate among different patient populations and facilities.

Methods:   Among participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Screening Trial linked to Medicare Part D claims data and answering a quality-of-life questionnaire, we examined the relationship between medication use over a 5-year period and various self-reported health status variables assessed several years later, including overall health status (STATUS) and trouble with activities of daily living (TADL). Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for the health status variables and metrics of medication use, including >60-day use, and for opiates, chronic use, with models controlling for demographics (model I), additionally for chronic conditions (model II), and additionally for other medication use (model III).  Results:   The study cohort included 22,844 PLCO participants (56% women, 90% non-Hispanic whites); 4.2% had chronic opioid use and 12.5% used for >60 days. Fair-poor STATUS was reported in 37.9% of participants with chronic opioid use versus 15.0% of participants without (p < 0.001).

Whether additional transcription factors participate to this reprogramming remains mostly unknown. To identify such factors, DNA motif analyses were performed in the promoter and regulatory regions of genes sensitive to androgens in PCa cells. These analyses identified two transcription factors, KLF5 and NFYA, as possibly associated with PCa cell metabolism. In clinical datasets, KLF5 and NFYA expression levels were associated with disease aggressiveness, being significantly decreased and increased, respectively, during PCa progression. Their expression was next investigated by qPCR and Western blot in human PCa cell models, revealing a positive regulation of KLF5 by androgens and a correlation between NFYA and AR protein expression status. siRNA-mediated knockdown of KLF5 increased human PCa cell proliferation rate in AR-positive cell models, suggesting a tumor suppressor function. Live-cell metabolic assays showed that knockdown of KLF5 promoted mitochondrial respiration, a key metabolic pathway associated with PCa progression. The opposite was observed for knockdown of NFYA regarding proliferation and respiration. RNA-seq analyses following the knockdown of either KLF5 and NFYA confirmed that both factors regulated distinct metabolic gene signatures, as well as other gene signatures, explaining their differential impact on PCa cell proliferation and metabolism. Overall, our findings identify KLF5 and NFYA as novel regulators of PCa cell metabolism.""","""['Raghavendra T K Poluri', 'Virginie Paquette', 'Éric P Allain', 'Camille Lafront', 'Charles Joly-Beauparlant', 'Cindy Weidmann', 'Arnaud Droit', 'Chantal Guillemette', 'Martin Pelletier', 'Étienne Audet-Walsh']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Endocr Relat Cancer""","""['Upregulation of MicroRNA-21 promotes tumorigenesis of prostate cancer cells by targeting KLF5.', 'Induction of Kruppel-like factor 5 expression by androgens results in increased CXCR4-dependent migration of prostate cancer cells in vitro.', 'Nuclear mTOR acts as a transcriptional integrator of the androgen signaling pathway in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Critical role of antioxidant programs in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer.', 'New insights into KLFs and SOXs in cancer pathogenesis, stemness, and therapy.', 'NF-YAl drives EMT in Claudinlow tumours.', 'NFYAv1 is a Tumor-Promoting Transcript Associated with Poor Prognosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Identifying Tumor-Associated Genes from Bilayer Networks of DNA Methylation Sites and RNAs.']"""

Generated via electron capture decay of 131Ba (t1/2 = 11.6 d, 100% EC), 131Cs has been used in brachytherapy for prostate cancer since 2004. The 131Ba parent is produced through neutron capture of enriched 130Ba in a nuclear reactor. For large-scale production of 131Ba, an accurate knowledge of production and burnup cross sections of 131Ba are essential. In this paper, we report two group cross sections (thermal and resonance integrals) for 130Ba and 131Ba and a new measure of the half-life of 131Ba. Targets consisting of milligram quantities of enriched 130Ba (∼35%) were irradiated in Oak Ridge National Laboratory's High Flux Isotope Reactor at thermal and resonance neutron fluxes of (1.9-2.1) × 1015 and (5.8-7.0) × 1013 neutrons·cm-2 s-1, respectively, for durations ranging from 3 to 26 days. In addition, cadmium covered samples of 130Ba were irradiated for 1 hour at 12.6% full reactor power (10.7 MW). The yield of 131Ba approaches a saturation value of ∼60 GBq (∼1.6 Ci) per mg of 130Ba for 20 days irradiation at a thermal neutron flux of 1.8 × 1015 n·s-1·cm-2, with a thermal/epithermal ratio of ∼30. Under the above experimental conditions, the two group cross sections of 130Ba are 6.9 ± 0.5 b (thermal, σ0) and 173 ± 7 b (resonance, I0). These values represent the sum of cross sections to metastable and ground states of 131Ba. For 131Ba, the empirically measured thermal cross section is 200 ± 50 b assuming an I0/σ0 of 10. This cross section is reported for the first time. Further, the half-life of 131Ba was remeasured to be 11.657 ± 0.008 d. Lastly, this study also resulted in the co-production of 133Ba (t1/2 = 10.52 y, 100% EC). The experimental yield of 133Ba is ∼370 MBq (∼10 mCi) per mg of 132Ba (thin target) for one cycle irradiation in the High Flux Isotope Reactor, and measured two-group 132Ba cross sections are 7.2 ± 0.2 b and 39.9 ± 1.3 b.

While there is an increasing body of survival and other data from retrospective analyses and prospective trials, there is no clear understanding of how best to predict therapy response and survival outcomes.  Objective:   In this retrospective cohort analysis, we aimed to identify features that are associated with response to radioligand therapy and greater survival based on analysis of real-world data.  Patients and methods:   191 patients aged 70 ± 8 years with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with radioligand therapy from November 2015 to February 2019 were included for analysis. Eligible patients had PSMA-expressing metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (confirmed by a 68Ga-PSMA-ligand positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scan), an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score ≤ 2 and no significant kidney, liver or bone marrow dysfunction (as characterised by kidney and liver function tests and a full blood count). Patients received one to five cycles of intravenous 177Lu-PSMA-ligand therapy. Endpoints included biochemical [prostate-specific antigen (PSA)] and radiologic (PSMA PET/CT) response, progression-free survival and overall survival, defined according to the Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 guidelines. Survival analysis was conducted by Kaplan-Meier estimation.  Results:   Most individuals (89.5%) previously underwent first- and second-line systematic therapy. Of the 191 men treated with 452 cycles with mean injected activity of 6.1 ± 1.0 GBq per cycle, 159 patients were assessed for a biochemical response defined as a PSA decline ≥ 50% from baseline. A ≥ 50% PSA decline was observed in 89 (56%) patients, while any PSA decline occurred in 120 (75%) men. For the entire cohort, median values (interquartile range) of overall survival [n = 191], PSA progression-free survival [n = 132] and PET/CT progression-free survival were 12 (5-18), 4 (3-8) and 6 (3-10) months, respectively. Survival analysis confirmed better outcomes in individuals who had demonstrated therapy response. Predominantly lymph node metastatic disease and chemotherapy-naïve status were significant pre-therapy factors associated with longer survival. Baseline PSA was significantly linked to survival outcomes: lower levels predicted a lower risk of death and disease progression. Treatment-related adverse events included grade 3 or 4 haematological (12%), grade 1 or 2 renal (4.5%), and grade 3 or 4 clinical events (5.7%).  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that 177Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy provides a significant response rate with a low toxicity profile. The evidence promotes greater efficacy of radioligand therapy in predominantly lymph node metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, and in individuals with chemotherapy-naïve status and lower levels of baseline PSA.""","""['Danielle Meyrick', 'Marat Gallyamov', 'Shanthi Sabarimurugan', 'Nadia Falzone', 'Nat Lenzo']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Target Oncol""","""['177Lu-PSMA-617 radionuclide treatment in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (LuPSMA trial): a single-centre, single-arm, phase 2 study.', 'Therapeutic efficacy, prognostic variables and clinical outcome of 177Lu-PSMA-617 PRLT in progressive mCRPC following multiple lines of treatment: prognostic implications of high FDG uptake on dual tracer PET-CT vis-à-vis Gleason score in such cohort.', '177LuLu-PSMA-617 versus cabazitaxel in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (TheraP): a randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial.', 'Third-line treatment and 177Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Therapeutic Responses and Survival Effects of 177Lu-PSMA-617 Radioligand Therapy in Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Meta-analysis.', 'The ""Ins and Outs"" of Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) as Specific Target in Prostate Cancer Therapy.', 'Adoption of Lutetium-177 PSMA radioligand therapy for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer: a total population analysis in Germany from 2016 to 2020.', 'Pharmacological Optimization of PSMA-Based Radioligand Therapy.', 'Addition of Standard Enzalutamide Medication Shows Synergistic Effects on Response to 177LuLu-PSMA-617 Radioligand Therapy in mCRPC Patients with Imminent Treatment Failure-Preliminary Evidence of Pilot Experience.', '177 Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy effectiveness in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Purpose To investigate the diagnostic performance of stiffness and fluidity quantified with tomoelastography, a multifrequency MR elastography technique, for depiction of PCa compared with multiparametric MRI with Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2.1. Materials and Methods Prospective participants suspected to have PCa and healthy controls (HCs) underwent multiparametric MRI and tomoelastography between March 2019 and July 2020. Tomoelastography maps of shear-wave speed (c) and loss angle (φ) quantified stiffness and fluidity, respectively, for PCa and benign prostatic disease and for the peripheral and transition zones in HCs. Differences between entities and regions were analyzed by using analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis test. Diagnostic performance was assessed with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis. Results There were 73 participants with PCa (mean age, 72 years ± 7 [standard deviation]), 82 with benign prostatic disease (66 years ± 7), and 53 HCs (41 years ± 14). Mean ± standard deviation of c and φ were higher in PCa (3.4 m/sec ± 0.6 and 1.3 radian ± 0.2, respectively) than in benign prostatic disease (2.6 m/sec ± 0.3 and 1.0 radian ± 0.2, respectively; P < .001) and age-matched HCs (2.2 m/sec ± 0.1 and 0.8 radian ± 0.1, respectively; P < .001). Incorporating c and φ (AUC, 0.95; 95% CI: 0.92, 0.98) improved the diagnostic performance of PI-RADS version 2.1 (AUC, 0.85; 95% CI: 0.80, 0.91; P < .001). Multiparametric MRI combined with c and φ enabled detection of PCa with 95% (78 of 82 non-PCa) specificity, which was significantly higher than with use of multiparametric MRI alone (77% [63 of 82 non-PCa]; P < .001). In regional analysis, c combined with φ enabled differentiation of transition zone PCa from benign prostatic hyperplasia (AUC, 0.91; 95% CI: 0.83, 0.98) and peripheral zone PCa from chronic prostatitis (AUC, 0.94; 95% CI: 0.88, 1.00).

Combination therapies are still required to target both at once. However, current medications are insufficient, due to an unfavorable balance between side effects and efficacy. The limited efficacy of α1 -blockers may be due to nonadrenergic mediators like endothelin-1 and thromboxane A2 (TXA2 ), which keep up prostate smooth muscle contraction even in the presence of α1 -blockers. Consequently, future options with higher efficacy need to target α1 -adrenergic and nonadrenergic contractions as well as stromal cell growth at once. Thalidomide has been approved as an oral medication for various diseases, including the treatment of prostate cancer. Therefore, we investigated the effect of thalidomide on cellular functions of prostate stromal cells and human prostate smooth muscle contraction.  Methods:   Cytoskeletal organization was visualized by phalloidin staining, cell growth was assessed by 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assay, cell viability by cell counting kit-8, and apoptosis and cell death by flow cytometry in cultured prostate stromal cells (WPMY-1). Contractions of human prostate tissues from radical prostatectomy were studied in an organ bath, where they were induced by the α1 -adrenoceptor agonists methoxamine, noradrenaline, phenylephrine, and the nonadrenergic agonists endothelin-1, TXA2 analog U46619, or electric field stimulation (EFS).  Results:   Thalidomide significantly reduced the proliferation of WPMY-1 cells, which was time- and concentration-dependent (10-300 µM). In parallel, organization of actin filaments collapsed after treatment with thalidomide. Thalidomide (30-100 µM) inhibited noradrenaline-, phenylephrine-, and methoxamine-induced contractions, as well as nonadrenergic contractions induced by endothelin-1 and U46619, and neurogenic contractions induced by EFS. No reduction in viability and no increases in apoptosis or in cell death were observed in WPMY-1 cells.  Conclusions:   Thalidomide impairs the growth of human prostate stromal cells, without showing a decrease in cell viability. In parallel, thalidomide inhibits adrenergic, neurogenic, and nonadrenergic contractions. This may be explained by a breakdown of the actin cytoskeleton. In vivo, urodynamic effects of thalidomide appear possible and may even exceed those of α1 -blockers or combination therapies.""","""['Alexander Tamalunas', 'Cora Sauckel', 'Anna Ciotkowska', 'Beata Rutz', 'Ruixiao Wang', 'Ru Huang', 'Bingsheng Li', 'Christian G Stief', 'Christian Gratzke', 'Martin Hennenberg']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Lenalidomide and pomalidomide inhibit growth of prostate stromal cells and human prostate smooth muscle contraction.', 'New strategies for inhibition of non-adrenergic prostate smooth muscle contraction by pharmacologic intervention.', 'Onvansertib, a polo-like kinase 1 inhibitor, inhibits prostate stromal cell growth and prostate smooth muscle contraction, which is additive to inhibition by α1-blockers.', 'Adrenoceptor pharmacology: urogenital applications.', 'Prostatic α1-adrenoceptors: new concepts of function, regulation, and intracellular signaling.', 'Treating LUTS in Men with Benign Prostatic Obstruction: A Review Article.', 'Anti-emetic effects of thalidomide: Evidence, mechanism of action, and future directions.', 'Synergistic effects of thalidomide and cisplatin are mediated via the PI3K/AKT and JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathways in cervical cancer.']"""

Results:   A total of 180 patients were included for analysis. Median OS was 13.5 months (95% confidence interval 11.5-15.5). Patients with elevated baseline ALP without ALP response after the first injection had significantly worse OS when compared to all other patients (median OS 7.9 months versus 15.7 months, hazard ratio 2.56, 95% confidence interval 1.73-3.80, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that elevated baseline ALP without ALP response after the first injection, the number of prior systemic therapies, baseline LDH level, and baseline ECOG performance status were prognostic factors of OS. Patients with elevated baseline ALP without ALP response after the first injection had significantly shorter times to ALP progression and first skeletal-related event, and more frequently discontinued radium-223 therapy when compared to other patients.  Conclusion:   Early treatment-induced changes in ALP after one radium-223 injection were associated with OS in metastatic CRPC patients.""","""['Maarten J van der Doelen', 'Agnes Stockhaus', 'Yuanjun Ma', 'Niven Mehra', 'Jeffrey Yachnin', 'Winald R Gerritsen', 'Sten Nilsson', 'Inge M van Oort', 'Anders Ullén']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Phase II study of radium-223 dichloride in Japanese patients with symptomatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Radium-223 in asymptomatic patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases treated in an international early access program.', 'Efficacy of Radium-223 in Bone-metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer with and Without Homologous Repair Gene Defects.', 'Optimal usage of radium-223 in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Patient Selection for Radium-223 Therapy in Patients With Bone Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: New Recommendations and Future Perspectives.', 'Alkaline phosphatase combines with CT factors for differentiating small (≤\u20094\xa0cm) fat-poor angiomyolipoma from renal cell carcinoma: a multiple quantitative tool.', 'Optimization of Radium-223 Treatment of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Based on the Burden of Skeletal Metastasis and Clinical Parameters.', 'Real-world effectiveness, long-term safety and treatment pathway integration of radium-223 therapy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Outcomes and Factors Associated with Completion of Radium-223 Therapy.', 'Radium-223 dichloride treatment in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in Finland: A real-world evidence multicenter study.']"""

Previous work has suggested that urinary volatile organic compound (VOC) biomarkers may be able to distinguish PrCa cases from benign disease. The behavior of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been proposed as a tool to take advantage of these potential VOC profiles. To test the ability of C. elegans Bristol N2 to distinguish PrCa cases from controls, we performed chemotaxis assays using human urine samples collected from men screened for PrCa. Behavioral response of nematodes towards diluted urine from PrCa cases was compared to response to samples from cancer-free controls. Overall, we observed a significant attraction of young adult-stage C. elegans nematodes to 1:100 diluted urine from confirmed PrCa cases and repulsion of C. elegans to urine from controls. When C. elegans chemotaxis index was considered alongside prostate-specific antigen levels for distinguishing cancer from cancer-free controls, the accuracy of patient classification was 81%. We also observed behavioral attraction of C. elegans to two previously reported VOCs to be increased in PrCa patient urine. We conclude nematode behavior distinguishes PrCa case urine from controls in a dilution-dependent manner.""","""['Morgan Thompson', 'Noemi Sarabia Feria', 'Ally Yoshioka', 'Eugene Tu', 'Fehmi Civitci', 'Suzanne Estes', 'Josiah T Wagner']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Biol Open""","""['Identification of a biomarker panel for improvement of prostate cancer diagnosis by volatile metabolic profiling of urine.', 'Feasibility of integrating canine olfaction with chemical and microbial profiling of urine to detect lethal prostate cancer.', 'Urinary Volatile Organic Compounds for the Detection of Prostate Cancer.', 'Development of an Early Cancer Detection Method Using the Olfaction of the Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.', 'Approaches to urinary detection of prostate cancer.', 'C. elegans as a Powerful Tool for Cancer Screening.', 'A new detection method for canine and feline cancer using the olfactory system of nematodes.', 'Non-invasive cancer detection in canine urine through Caenorhabditis elegans chemotaxis.', 'Nematode-Applied Technology for Human Tumor Microenvironment Research and Development.', 'Pond Assay for the Sensory Systems of Caenorhabditis elegans: A Novel Anesthesia-Free Method Enabling Detection of Responses to Extremely Low Chemical Concentrations.']"""

Conventional imaging often fails to localize early recurrences, hampering the potential for radical approaches.  Objective:   We hypothesize that prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted PET-MR/CT allows for earlier detection and localization of oligorecurrent-PCa, unveiling a molecularly-defined state amenable to curative-intent metastasis-directed treatment (MDT).  Design/setting/participants:   Single-institution single-arm phase-two study. Patients with rising PSA (0.4-3.0 ng/mL) after maximal local therapy (radical prostatectomy and post-operative radiotherapy), negative conventional staging, and no prior salvage hormonal therapy (HT) were eligible.  Interventions:   All patients underwent [18F]DCFPyL PET-MR/CT. Patients with molecularly-defined oligorecurrent-PCa had MDT (stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy [SABR] or surgery) without HT.  Outcome measurements/statistical analysis:   Primary endpoint was biochemical response (complete, i.e. biochemical 'no evidence of disease' [bNED], or partial response [100% or ≥50% PSA decline from baseline, respectively]) after MDT. Simon's two-stage design was employed (null and alternate hypotheses <5% and >20% response rate, respectively), with α and β of 0.1.  Results:   Seventy-two patients were enrolled (May/2017-July/2019). Thirty-eight (53%) had PSMA-detected oligorecurrent-PCa amenable for MDT. Thirty-seven (51%) agreed to MDT: 10 and 27 underwent surgery and SABR, respectively. Median follow-up was 15.9 months (IQR 9.8-19.1). Of patients receiving MDT, the overall response rate was 60%, including 22% rendered bNED. One (2.7%) grade 3 toxicity (intra-operative ureteric injury) was observed.  Conclusions:   PSMA-defined oligorecurrent-PCa can be rendered bNED, a necessary step towards cure, in 1 of 5 patients receiving MDT alone. Randomized trials are justified to determine if MDT +/- systemic agents can expand the curative therapeutic armamentarium for PCa.  Patient summary:   We studied men treated for prostate cancer with rising PSA. We found PSMA imaging detected recurrent cancer in three-quarters of patients, and targeted treatment to these areas significantly decreased PSA in half of patients.""","""['Rachel M Glicksman', 'Ur Metser', 'Douglass Vines', 'John Valliant', 'Zhihui Liu', 'Peter W Chung', 'Robert G Bristow', 'Antonio Finelli', 'Robert Hamilton', 'Neil E Fleshner', 'Nathan Perlis', 'Alexandre R Zlotta', 'David Green', 'Andrew Bayley', 'Joelle Helou', 'Srinivas Raman', 'Girish Kulkarni', 'Charles Catton', 'Tony Lam', 'Rosanna Chan', 'Padraig Warde', 'Mary Gospodarowicz', 'David A Jaffray', 'Alejandro Berlin']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Re: Rachel M.

We assessed efficacy and tolerance as soon as this technique was implemented.  Methods and materials:   Patients received 7 Gy on the first day, followed by 8 × 4 Gy over the next 4 days for exclusive BT and 9 × 4 Gy over 5 days for post-operative BT.

Patients with 4Kscore results <7.5% have been proven to be at low risk of carrying high-grade CaP. This study employed a meta-analysis approach in order to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the 4Kscore as a means of detecting high-grade CaP in prostate biopsy samples using cutoff values of 7.5% to 10%.  Methods:   Relevant studies published as of December 2019 were identified via searching PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Data pertaining to 4Kscore diagnostic accuracy were then extracted from these studies and utilized for the calculation of pooled sensitivity , specificity , diagnostic odds ratio , and area under the curve values relating to high-grade CaP diagnosis.  Results:   In total, 9 studies incorporating 1,689 high-grade CaP patients were included in our meta-analysis. Following the exclusion of 1 outlier study, the pooled sensitivity, specificity , diagnostic odds ratio , and area under the curve values for 4Kscore diagnostic accuracy with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 0.90 (95%CI: 0.86-0.92), 0.44 (95%CI: 0.36-0.52), 7 (95%CI: 5-8), and 0.81 (95%CI: 0.77-0.84), respectively.  Conclusion:   These findings indicate that 4Kscore can be used as a model for the diagnosis of high-grade CaP. However, we detected significant heterogeneity among studies that was not explained by subgroup or meta-regression analysis, thus lowering our confidence in these results. It is therefore essential that future large, well-designed studies be conducted so as to confirm whether the 4Kscore can be used with cutoff values of 7.5% to 10% to reliably detect high-grade CaP.""","""['Chao Mi', 'Lu Bai', 'Yuyang Yang', 'Jie Duan', 'Li Gao']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Reducing unnecessary biopsies while detecting clinically significant prostate cancer including cribriform growth with the ERSPC Rotterdam risk calculator and 4Kscore.', 'Clinical performance of the 4Kscore Test to predict high-grade prostate cancer at biopsy: A meta-analysis of us and European clinical validation study results.', 'A multi-institutional prospective trial in the USA confirms that the 4Kscore accurately identifies men with high-grade prostate cancer.', 'Diagnostic value of urine prostate cancer antigen 3 test using a cutoff value of 35 μg/L in patients with prostate cancer.', 'The role of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System score in Gleason 3\u2009+\u20093 active surveillance candidates enrollment: a diagnostic meta-analysis.']"""

To enhance the bioavailability of siRNAs in tumors, novel, safe, and effective carriers are needed.  Results:   Here, we developed cationic solid lipid nanoparticles (cSLNs) to carry siRNAs targeting EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase (siEphA2), which is overexpressed in many solid tumors including prostate cancer. Using DDAB cationic lipid instead of DOTMA reduced nanoparticle size and enhanced both cellular uptake and gene silencing in prostate cancer cells. DDAB-cSLN showed better cellular uptake efficiency with similar silencing compared to commercial transfection reagent (Dharmafect 2). After verifying the efficacy of siEphA2-loaded nanoparticles, we further evaluated a potential combination with a histone lysine demethylase inhibitor, JIB-04. Silencing EphA2 by siEphA2-loaded DDAB-cSLN did not affect the viability (2D or 3D culture), migration, nor clonogenicity of PC-3 cells alone. However, upon co-administration with JIB-04, there was a decrease in cellular responses. Furthermore, JIB-04 decreased EphA2 expression, and thus, silencing by siEphA2-loaded nanoparticles was further increased with co-treatment.  Conclusions:   We have successfully developed a novel siRNA-loaded lipid nanoparticle for targeting EphA2. Moreover, preliminary results of the effects of JIB-04, alone and in combination with siEphA2, on prostate cancer cells and prostate cancer tumor spheroids were presented for the first time.

Mechanistic studies also exhibited that colchicine treatment results in cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase as well as decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and increased early and late apoptotic cells.

Besides, colchicine treatment significantly increased the total oxidant (TOS) level, which is a signal of oxidative stress and potential cause of DNA damage. Finally, the results of quantitative real-time PCR experiments demonstrated that colchicine treatment concentration-dependently suppressed MMP-9 mRNA expression.

These contradictory results may be due to variations in sample sizes and/or deficiency of statistical modeling. Therefore, an attempt is made to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the association between the IL-6 gene SNPs (rs1800795, rs1800796, rs1800797) and different cancer risks, giving the weight on a large sample size, including different cancer types and appropriate statistical modeling with the meta-dataset. In order to attain a more reliable consensus decision about the association between the IL-6 gene polymorphisms and different cancer risks, in this study, we performed a multi-case statistical meta-analysis based on the collected information of 118 GWAS studies comprising of 50053 cases and 65204 control samples. Results from this Meta-analysis indicated a significant association (p-value < 0.05) of the IL-6 gene rs1800796 polymorphism with an overall increased cancer risk. The subgroup analysis data based on cancer types exhibited significant association (p-value < 0.05) of the rs1800795 polymorphism with an overall increased risk of cervical, liver and prostate cancers; the rs1800796 polymorphism with lung, prostate and stomach cancers; and the rs1800797 polymorphism with cervical cancer. The subgroup analysis of ethnicity data showed a significant association (p-value < 0.05) of an overall cancer risk with the rs1800795 polymorphism for the African and Asian populations, the rs1800796 polymorphism for the Asian only and the rs1800797 polymorphism in the African population. Comparative discussion showed that our multi-case meta-analyses received more support than any previously reported individual meta-analysis about the association between the IL-6 gene polymorphisms and cancer risks. Results from this study, more confidently showed that the IL-6 gene SNPs (rs1800795, rs1800796 and rs1800797) in humans are associated with increased cancer risks.

We stratified according to 3 racial/ethnic groups (White vs Black vs Hispanic) and prostate cancer baseline characteristics (prostate specific antigen, clinical T stage, Gleason group grading, percentage of biopsy cores). We tabulated active treatment rates (radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy) without and with adjustment for baseline age and prostate cancer characteristics.  Results:   Baseline prostate specific antigen, clinical T stage, Gleason grade and percentage of positive biopsy cores differed according to racial/ethnic groups in both favorable and unfavorable intermediate risk prostate cancer patients (all p <0.05). Similarly, radical prostatectomy and external beam radiotherapy rates differed according to race/ethnicity in both favorable and unfavorable intermediate risk prostate cancer patients. Radical prostatectomy and external beam radiotherapy rates respectively ranged from 31.7%-41.8% and 26.3%-31.0% in favorable intermediate risk cases and from 33.4%-43.9% and 30.9%-35.5% in unfavorable intermediate risk prostate cancer, across the 3 race/ethnicity groups (both p <0.05).

Methods:   We identified 361 consecutive patients, from an IRB-approved database, on AS for prostate cancer with minimum 2 years follow-up. Patients were grouped into two cohorts, those using 5-ARIs (5-ARI; n = 119) or not using 5-ARIs (no 5-ARI; n = 242). Primary and secondary endpoints were treatment-free survival (TFS) and PP-free survival (PPFS), which were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Univariate and multivariable cox regression analysis were used to identify predictors for PP and DT. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Results:   Baseline characteristics and the prostate biopsy rate were similar between the two groups. Median (range) follow-up was 5.7 (2.0-17.2) years. Five-year and 10-year TFS was 92% and 59% for the 5-ARI group versus 80% and 51% for the no 5-ARI group (p = 0.005), respectively.

Célkitűzés: A rákbetegek pszichoszociális háttere napjainkig alulvizsgált terület Magyarországon. A szerzők célja a magyar prosztatarákos férfiak szociodemográfiai, egészségi, mentális állapotának vizsgálata volt. Módszer: A vizsgálatban 100 prosztatarákos férfi vett részt, akiknek más urológiai betegsége nem volt, továbbá más daganatos betegségből kifolyó kezelésben nem részesültek a kérdőív kitöltésekor. A részvétel anonim és önkéntes volt. A standard validált tesztek mellett - mint a Beck Depresszió Kérdőív, Rosenberg Önértékelés Skála - szociodemográfiai, egészségmagatartás- és életmód-kérdéscsoportokat tartalmazott kérdőívünk. Statisztikai analízis: Leíró statisztikát, khi-négyzet-próbát, lineáris regresszió analízist, Fisher-egzakt tesztet, kétmintás t-próbát végeztünk 95%-os valószínűségi szinten az SPSS 20.0 és a Microsoft Excel 2016-os programban. Eredmények: Az egészségi állapotot a lakhely településcsoportja (p = 0,024), az anyagi helyzet (p = 0,001), a krónikus betegség (p = 0,000), a fizikai aktivitás (p = 0,000) és az alkoholfogyasztás (p = 0,001) befolyásolta. A társas támogatás (p = 0,726) ellenben nem bizonyult befolyásoló tényezőnek. A megkérdezettek 66%-a volt elhízott a BMI alapján. Helyesen csupán a megkérdezettek egyharmada táplálkozott a ma érvényes MDOSZ-ajánlás alapján. 62%-uk enyhén depressziósnak volt mondható a Beck Depresszió Kérdőív alapján, 73%-uk önértékelése azonban a Rosenberg Önértékelés Skála alapján átlagosnak volt mondható.

Introduction:   Prostate cancer is one of the most common malignant cancers amongst men. More than 4600 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year in Hungary.  Objective:   The psychosocial background of cancer patients is an underexamined area in Hungary. The aim of the authors was to obtain information on the sociodemographic status, health and mental status of Hungarian men with prostate cancer.  Method:   100 prostate cancer patiens were included in the study who did not have any urologic diseases and did not go under any therapy due to any other type of cancer. The applied questionnaire was put together by the authors about sociodemographic and health status, lifestyle. The Beck's Depression Inventory and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale were also used.  Statistical analysis:   We used descriptive statistics, chi-square test, linear regression, Fisher's exact test, independent t-sample test on a 95% probability level in the SPSS 20.0 and Microsoft Excel 2016 softwers.  Results:   The settlement classification (p = 0.024), financial status (p = 0.001), chronic illnesses (p = 0.000), physical activity (p = 0.000) and alcohol consumption (p = 0.001) affected the health status. Only one third of the respondents ate healthy according to the recommendations of the MDOSZ. 66% of the respondents were overweight. 62% of the respondents were depressed according to the Beck's Depression Inventory, however, 73% of them had average self-esteem measured by the Rosenberg Scale. We proved that with age either the depression score or the self-esteem score did not increase.  Conclusion:   Our results roughly mirror the national and international literature about health behavior. No connection was found between self-esteem and depression.

Purpose:   To develop and test radiomics models based on manually or automatically gained masks on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps to predict high-grade (Gleason score ≥ 4 + 3) PCa at radical prostatectomy (RP).  Study type:   Retrospective.  Population:   A total of 176 patients (94 high-grade PCa and 82 low-grade PCa) with complete RP, preoperative biopsy, and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) were retrospectively recruited and randomly divided into training (N = 123) and test (N = 53) cohorts.  Field strength/sequence:   Using a 3.0-T MR scanner, ADC maps were calculated from diffusion-weighted imaging (b values = 0, 1400 s/mm2 , echo planar imaging).  Assessment:   Two radiologists segmented the whole prostate gland and the most index prostate lesion. Automatic segmentation of the prostate and the lesion were performed. Four radiomics models were constructed using four masks (manual/automatic prostate gland/PCa lesion segmentation). According to the standard reference of the RP histopathologic assessment, the performance of each radiomics models was compared with that of biopsy and Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2.1 (PI-RADS) assessment.  Statistical tests:   A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was employed to estimate the area under the curve (AUC) values of the models. The AUCs of the four models, biopsy, and PI-RADS assessment were compared using the DeLong test.  Results:   The four radiomics models yielded AUCs of 0.710, 0.731, 0.726, and 0.709 in the test cohort, respectively; biopsy and PI-RADS assessment yielded AUCs of 0.793 and 0.680, respectively. No significant differences were found among model, biopsy, and PI-RADS assessment comparisons (P = 0.132-0.988).  Data conclusion:   To distinguish high-grade from low-grade PCa, radiomics models based on automatic segmentation on ADC maps exhibit approximately the same diagnostic efficacy as manual segmentation and biopsy, highlighting the possibility of a fully automatic workflow combining automated segmentation with radiomics analysis.

Endothelium integrity is an important barrier to prevent tumor invasion and metastasis. Changes in endothelial cells (ECs) due to tumor cell adhesion provide important signaling mechanisms for the angiogenesis and metastasis of tumor cells. However, the changes happened in endothelial cells when tumor-endothelium interactions are still unclear. In this study, we used Affymetrix Gene Chip Human Transcriptome Array 2.0. and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) to clarify the detailed gene alteration in endothelial cells adhered by prostate tumor cells PC-3M. A total of 504 differentially expressed mRNAs and 444 lncRNAs were obtained through chip data analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) function analysis showed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) mainly mediated gland development and DNA replication at the biological level; at the cell component level, they were mainly involved in the mitochondrial inner membrane; and at the molecular function level, DEGs were mainly enriched in ATPase activity and catalytic activity. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signal pathway analysis showed that the DEGs mainly regulated pathways in cancer, cell cycle, pyrimidine metabolism, and the mTOR signaling pathway. Then, we constructed a protein-protein interaction functional network and mRNA-lncRNA interaction network using Cytoscape v3.7.2. to identify core genes, mRNAs, and lncRNAs. The miRNAs targeted by the core mRNA PRKAA2 were predicted using databases (miRDB, RNA22, and Targetscan). The qPCR results showed that miR-124-3p, the predicted target miRNA of PRKAA2, was significantly downregulated in endothelial cells adhered by PC-3M. With a dual luciferase reporter assay, the binding of miR-124-3p with PRKAA2 3'UTR was confirmed. Additionally, by using the knockdown lentiviral vectors of miR-124-3p to downregulate the miR-124-3p expression level in endothelial cells, we found that the expression level of PRKAA2 increased accordingly. Taken together, the adhesion of tumor cells had a significant effect on mRNAs and lncRNAs in the endothelial cells, in which PRKAA2 is a notable changed molecule and miR-124-3p could regulate its expression and function in endothelial cells.""","""['Yan Pan', 'Marhaba Abdureyim', 'Qing Yao', 'Xuejun Li']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Front Cell Dev Biol""","""['Exploring the Molecular Mechanisms of Pterygium by Constructing lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA Regulatory Network.', 'Comprehensive analysis of transcriptome-wide expression patterns and a circRNA/lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia in Rattus norvegicus.', 'Exploration and validation of downregulated microRNA-199a-3p, downstream messenger RNA targets and transcriptional regulation in osteosarcoma.', 'PTHR1 May Be Involved in Progression of Osteosarcoma by Regulating miR-124-3p-AR-Tgfb1i1, miR-27a-3p-PPARG-Abca1, and miR-103/590-3p-AXIN2 Axes.', 'Integrated Bioinformatics Analysis of mRNAs and miRNAs Identified Potential Biomarkers of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Integration of Chemoinformatics and Multi-Omics Analysis Defines ECT2 as a Potential Target for Cancer Drug Therapy.', 'Potential targets and mechanisms of photobiomodulation for spinal cord injury.', 'Circular CPM promotes chemoresistance of gastric cancer via activating PRKAA2-mediated autophagy.']"""

Chemotherapy is considered as a common strategy for cancer treatment; however, toxic side effects and drug resistance associated with chemotherapy are major drawbacks with this approach. It is well known that a diet rich in flavonoids can reduce the incidence of many types of cancer in a significant manner, and it was proved that methoxy flavones have greater bioavailability compared to the nonmethylated ones. Calycopterin is a tetramethoxy ﬂavone which was demonstrated to have anti-proliferative effects on colon, gastric, and osteosarcoma cancer cells. Therefore, in the current study, we have evaluated the apoptotic effects of this flavonoid on two prostate cancer cell lines in-vitro. The MTT assay revealed that after 48 h treatment with this flavonoid, cell viability reduced to 50% compared to the control group. However, calycopterin treatment of healthy HUVEC did not cause any significant reduction in cell viability. Moreover, the clonogenic assay demonstrated that after 14 days, colony size and numbers reduced significantly in calycopterin treated cells. In addition, the percentage of the sub-G1 population in calycopterin-treated cells augmented significantly compared to untreated group.

Its expression and role in prostate tumour-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) have not been elucidated.  Objective:   To characterise CD38 expression on prostate cancer (PC) epithelial cells and TIICs, and to associate this expression with clinical outcomes.  Design, setting, and participants:   RNAseq from 159 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in the International Stand Up To Cancer/Prostate Cancer Foundation (SU2C/PCF) cohort and 171 mCRPC samples taken from 63 patients in the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre cohort were analysed. CD38 expression was immunohistochemically scored by a validated assay on 51 castration-resistant PC (CRPC) and matching, same-patient castration-sensitive PC (CSPC) biopsies obtained between 2016 and 2018, and was associated with retrospectively collected clinical data. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: mCRPC transcriptomes were analysed for associations between CD38 expression and gene expression signatures. Multiplex immunofluorescence determined CD38 expression in PC biopsies. Differences in CD38+ TIIC densities between CSPC and CRPC biopsies were analysed using a negative binomial mixed model. Differences in the proportions of CD38+ epithelial cells between non-matched benign prostatic epithelium and PC were compared using Fisher's exact test. Differences in the proportions of biopsies containing CD38+ tumour epithelial cells between matched CSPC and CRPC biopsies were compared by McNemar's test. Univariable and multivariable survival analyses were performed using Cox regression models.  Results and limitations:   CD38 mRNA expression in mCRPC was most significantly associated with upregulated immune signalling pathways. CD38 mRNA expression was associated with interleukin (IL)-12, IL-23, and IL-27 signalling signatures as well as immunosuppressive adenosine signalling and T cell exhaustion signatures. CD38 protein was frequently expressed on phenotypically diverse TIICs including B cells and myeloid cells, but largely absent from tumour epithelial cells. CD38+ TIIC density increased with progression to CRPC and was independently associated with worse overall survival. Future studies are required to dissect TIIC CD38 function.  Conclusions:   CD38+ prostate TIICs associate with worse survival and immunosuppressive mechanisms. The role of CD38 in PC progression warrants investigation as insights into its functions may provide rationale for CD38 targeting in lethal PC.  Patient summary:   CD38 is expressed on the surface of white blood cells surrounding PC cells. These cells may impact PC growth and treatment resistance. Patients with PC with more CD38-expressing white blood cells are more likely to die earlier.""","""['Christina Guo', 'Mateus Crespo', 'Bora Gurel', 'David Dolling', 'Jan Rekowski', 'Adam Sharp', 'Antonella Petremolo', 'Semini Sumanasuriya', 'Daniel N Rodrigues', 'Ana Ferreira', 'Rita Pereira', 'Ines Figueiredo', 'Niven Mehra', 'Maryou B K Lambros', 'Antje Neeb', 'Veronica Gil', 'George Seed', 'Leon Terstappen', 'Andrea Alimonti', 'Charles G Drake', 'Wei Yuan', 'Johann S de Bono;International SUC PCF Prostate Cancer Dream Team']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['CD38 as a Novel Immunosuppressive Target in Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Heterogeneity and DNA Repair Defects in Prostate Cancer.', 'B7-H3 as a Therapeutic Target in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Next-generation sequencing of advanced prostate cancer treated with androgen-deprivation therapy.', 'Enzalutamide: targeting the androgen signalling pathway in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Immunogenomic profiles associated with response to life-prolonging agents in prostate cancer.', 'The interplay between the DNA damage response and ectonucleotidases modulates tumor response to therapy.', 'Bacterial lipopolysaccharide-related genes are involved in the invasion and recurrence of prostate cancer and are related to immune escape based on bioinformatics analysis.', 'Immune and pathologic responses in patients with localized prostate cancer who received daratumumab (anti-CD38) or edicotinib (CSF-1R inhibitor).', 'The number of the intraepithelial T cells correlate with the proliferation index in human bulbourethral gland epithelium.']"""

Previous studies suggest that ductal variant histology may be associated with worse clinical outcomes, but these are difficult to interpret. To address this, we performed an international, multi-institutional study to describe the characteristics of ductal adenocarcinoma, particularly focussing on the effect of presence of ductal variant cancer on metastasis-free survival.  Methods:   Patients with ductal variant histology from two institutional databases who underwent radical prostatectomies were identified and compared with an independent acinar adenocarcinoma cohort. After propensity score matching, the effect of the presence of ductal adenocarcinoma on time to biochemical recurrence, initiation of salvage therapy and the development of metastatic disease was determined. Deep whole-exome sequencing was performed for selected cases (n = 8).  Results:   A total of 202 ductal adenocarcinoma and 2037 acinar adenocarcinoma cases were analysed. Survival analysis after matching demonstrated that patients with ductal variant histology had shorter salvage-free survival (8.1 versus 22.0 months, p = 0.03) and metastasis-free survival (6.7 versus 78.6 months, p < 0.0001). Ductal variant histology was consistently associated with RB1 loss, as well as copy number gains in TAP1, SLC4A2 and EHHADH.  Conclusions:   The presence of any ductal variant adenocarcinoma at the time of prostatectomy portends a worse clinical outcome than pure acinar cancers, with significantly shorter times to initiation of salvage therapies and the onset of metastatic disease. These features appear to be driven by uncoupling of chromosomal duplication from cell division, resulting in widespread copy number aberration with specific gain of genes implicated in treatment resistance.""","""['Ken Chow', 'Justin Bedő', 'Andrew Ryan', 'Dinesh Agarwal', 'Damien Bolton', 'Yee Chan', 'Philip Dundee', 'Mark Frydenberg', 'Marc A Furrer', 'Jeremy Goad', 'Dennis Gyomber', 'Uri Hanegbi', 'Laurence Harewood', 'Dennis King', 'Alastair D Lamb', 'Nathan Lawrentschuk', 'Peter Liodakis', 'Daniel Moon', 'Declan G Murphy', 'Justin S Peters', 'Paul Ruljancich', 'Clare L Verrill', 'David Webb', 'Lih-Ming Wong', 'Homayoun Zargar', 'Anthony J Costello', 'Anthony T Papenfuss', 'Christopher M Hovens', 'Niall M Corcoran']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['Editorial for Cribriform architecture prostatic adenocarcinoma in needle biopsy is a strong independent predictor for lymph node metastases in radical prostatectomy (M.

This study evaluated the accuracy of preoperative transabdominal ultrasound (TAUS) compared to radical prostatectomy specimens and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) in estimating prostate volume and identifying presence of median lobe, across different size groups, using the standard ellipsoid formula. The effect of median lobe on accuracy was also assessed. Materials and Methods: Ninety-eight men undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy were enrolled in this study. Preoperative evaluation of prostate volume was done using measurements obtained from TAUS using the Clarius C3 handheld wireless point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) and from TRUS Clarius EC7. Participants were grouped based on prostate size (<30, 30-60, and >60 g). Mean absolute percentage of error was used to evaluate accuracy. Mean percentage of error determined if there was an overestimation or underestimation. Correlation between each TAUS size group, true prostate weight and TRUS was assessed. Results: Irrespective of body mass index, TAUS accurately identified median lobe in all men. No statistically significant difference was found between specimen weight and TAUS prostate size for the >60 g group. Among this same group, a strong correlation was noted between specimen weight and TAUS prostate size (r = 0.911, p < 0.001). There was also a strong correlation between TAUS and TRUS measurements for this group (r = 0.950, p < 0.001). Presence of median lobe did not have an impact on measurement accuracy. Conclusions: Bedside handheld wireless POCUS provides rapid, inexpensive, noninvasive, and clinically accurate TAUS prostate assessments for larger prostates.

Results:   Our cohort consisted of 636 patients. Non-neoplastic tissue stained less frequently (36.5%) than neoplastic tissue (47.4%), with expression increasing from Gleason pattern 3 towards pattern 5.

Actually, brachytherapy is the most advanced radiotherapy strategy for the local treatment of prostate cancer. It consists in the placing of radioactive sources closed to the tumour side thus killing cancer cells. However, brachytherapy causes the same adverse effects of external-beam radiotherapy. Therefore, alternative treatment approaches are required for enhancing radiotherapy effectiveness and reducing toxic symptoms. Nanostructured exfoliated black phosphorus (2D BP) may represent a strategic tool for local cancer therapy because of its capability to induce singlet oxygen production and act as photosensitizer. Hence, we investigated 2D BP in vitro effect on healthy and cancer prostate cell behavior. 2D BP was obtained through liquid exfoliation. 2D BP effect on healthy and cancer prostate cell behaviors was analyzed by investigating cell viability, oxidative stress and inflammatory marker expression. 2D BP inhibited prostate cancer cell survival, meanwhile promoted healthy prostate cell survival in vitro by modulating oxidative stress and immune response with and without near-infrared light (NIR)-irradiation. Nanostructured 2D BP is able to inhibit in vitro prostate cancer cells survival and preserve healthy prostate cell vitality through the control of oxidative stress and immune response, respectively.""","""['Ines Fasolino', 'Alessandra Soriente', 'Maria Caporali', 'Manuel Serrano-Ruiz', 'Maurizio Peruzzini', 'Luigi Ambrosio', 'Maria Grazia Raucci']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Exfoliated Black Phosphorus Promotes in Vitro Bone Regeneration and Suppresses Osteosarcoma Progression through Cancer-Related Inflammation Inhibition.', 'A comprehensive panel of three-dimensional models for studies of prostate cancer growth, invasion and drug responses.', 'A novel epoxypropoxy flavonoid derivative and topoisomerase II inhibitor, MHY336, induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Does brachytherapy have a role in the treatment of prostate cancer?', 'Advanced prostate cancer: reinforcing the strings between inflammation and the metastatic behavior.', 'ROS-Generating Hyaluronic Acid-Modified Zirconium Dioxide-Acetylacetonate Nanoparticles as a Theranostic Platform for the Treatment of Osteosarcoma.', 'Label-Free Morpho-Molecular Imaging for Studying the Differential Interaction of Black Phosphorus with Tumor Cells.']"""

New small molecules which kill a wide range of cancer subtypes, with good therapeutic window in vivo, have the potential to complement the current arsenal of anti-cancer agents and deliver improved safety profiles for cancer patients. We describe results with a new anti-cancer small molecule, WEHI-7326, which causes cell cycle arrest in G2/M, cell death in vitro, and displays efficacious anti-tumor activity in vivo. WEHI-7326 induces cell death in a broad range of cancer cell lines, including taxane-resistant cells, and inhibits growth of human colon, brain, lung, prostate and breast tumors in mice xenografts. Importantly, the compound elicits tumor responses as a single agent in patient-derived xenografts of clinically aggressive, treatment-refractory neuroblastoma, breast, lung and ovarian cancer. In combination with standard-of-care, WEHI-7326 induces a remarkable complete response in a mouse model of high-risk neuroblastoma. WEHI-7326 is mechanistically distinct from known microtubule-targeting agents and blocks cells early in mitosis to inhibit cell division, ultimately leading to apoptotic cell death. The compound is simple to produce and possesses favorable pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles in rodents. It represents a novel class of anti-cancer therapeutics with excellent potential for further development due to the ease of synthesis, simple formulation, moderate side effects and potent in vivo activity.

Second, we determined whether intravenous administration of furosemide shortly after tracer injection increases renal washout of 68Ga-PSMA-11 before it binds to the PSMA receptor with possible influence on biodistribution and intensity of tracer uptake in organs with physiologic tracer accumulation. Methods: In a retrospective analysis, 2 different groups with 220 prostate cancer patients each, referred for 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT because of biochemical recurrence after primary therapy, were compared: patients in group 1 (median prostate-specific antigen, 1.30 ng/mL) received no preparation before imaging, whereas patients in group 2 (median prostate-specific antigen, 0.82 ng/mL) were injected with 20 mg of furosemide and 500 mL of sodium chloride (NaCl 0.9%) immediately after tracer injection. The presence of local recurrence was assessed visually. In addition, the intensity of tracer accumulation in organs with physiologic tracer uptake was evaluated. Results: The detection rate of lesions judged positive for local recurrence was significantly higher in patients receiving furosemide than in patients without preparation: 56 cases (25.5%) versus 38 cases (17.3%), respectively (P = 0.048). Median maximum SUVs (SUVmax) of organs with physiologic uptake of 68Ga-PSMA-11 in groups 1 and 2 were urinary bladder (63.0 vs. 8.9), kidney (55.6 vs. 54.5), liver (9.9 vs. 9.4), spleen (11.2 vs. 11.9), small bowel (16.2 vs. 17.1), parotid gland (19.2 vs. 19.6), lacrimal gland (8.9 vs. 10.9), blood-pool activity (2.2 vs. 2.3), muscle (1.0 vs. 1.1), and bone (1.6 vs. 1.6). Apart from bladder activity, no significant reduction of tracer accumulation was found in the patient group receiving furosemide. Conclusion: Injection of 20 mg of furosemide at the time point of radiotracer administration significantly increases the detection rate of local recurrence in prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence referred for 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT.

We conducted a systematic study on the expression of membranous PD-L1 (mPD-L1) and nuclear PD-1-L1 (nPD-L1) in prostate needle biopsy specimens of prostate cancer patients who underwent primary radiotherapy and analyzed the association between PD-L1 expression and clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of patients.  Method:   A total of 971 cancer-containing prostate needle biopsy cores from 172 patients were immunohistochemically stained with anti-PD-L1 antibody. The association of PD-L1 expression with Gleason score and tumor volume percentage was evaluated for each biopsy core. Total of 171 patients were divided according to mPD-L1 or nPD-L1 expression, and clinicopathological characteristics were compared between the positive and negative groups. The prognostic significance of mPD-L1, nPD-L1 and common prognostic factors were analyzed in terms of biochemical recurrence.  Result:   Total of 15% and 46% of biopsy cores were stained positive for mPD-L1 and nPD-L1, respectively. There was a positive correlation between Gleason score and mPD-L1 and a negative correlation between Gleason score and nPD-L1. Between mPD-L1 and nPD-L1, there was no significant correlation. There was intraindividual heterogeneity in PD-L1 expression among different Gleason scores. For mPD-L1, only pretreatment PSA was significantly higher in the positive group than in the negative, but not Gleason score and T stage. For nPD-L1, Gleason score and T stage were significantly higher in the positive group than in the negative. Both mPD-L1 and nPD-L1 expression were not predictive of BCR-free survival in univariate and multivariate analyses.

Opioids can have immune modulating effects, but their relation to cancer recurrence is unclear. We evaluated whether opioids used during prostatectomy can affect biochemical recurrence-free survival.  Methods:   We randomised 146 patients with prostate cancer scheduled for prostatectomy into opioid-free anaesthesia or opioid-based anaesthesia groups. Baseline characteristics, perioperative data, and level of prostate-specific antigen every 6 months for 2 yr after surgery were recorded. Prostate-specific antigen >0.2 ng ml-1 was considered biochemical recurrence. A survival analysis compared time with biochemical recurrence between the groups, and a Cox regression was modelled to evaluate which variables affect biochemical recurrence-free survival.  Results:   We observed 31 biochemical recurrence events: 17 in the opioid-free anaesthesia group and 14 in the opioid-based anaesthesia group. Biochemical recurrence-free survival was not statistically different between groups (P=0.54). Cox regression revealed that biochemical recurrence-free survival was shorter in cases of obesity (hazard ratio [HR] 1.63, confidence interval [CI] 0.16-3.10; p=0.03), high D'Amico risk (HR 1.58, CI 0.35-2.81; P=0.012), laparoscopic surgery (HR 1.6, CI 0.38-2.84; P=0.01), stage 3 tumour pathology (HR 1.60, CI 0.20-299) and N1 status (HR 1.34, CI 0.28-2.41), and positive surgical margins (HR 1.37, CI 0.50-2.24; P=0.002). The anaesthesia technique did not affect time to biochemical recurrence (HR -1.03, CI -2.65-0.49; P=0.18).

Results:   Here, a semiquantitative LFIA platform for PSA detection in blood was developed using Au-Ag nanoparticles (NPs) assembled on silica NPs (SiO2@Au-Ag NPs) that served as signal reporters.

In LFIA, the color intensity of the test line on the test strip differed depending on the PSA concentration (0.30-10.00 ng/mL), and bands for the test line on the test strip could be used as a standard. When clinical samples were assessed using this LFIA, a visual test line with particular color intensity observed on the test strip enabled the early diagnosis and prognosis of patients with prostate cancer based on PSA detection.

In this state, chemotherapy with taxanes such as Docetaxel (DTX) comprises the first line of treatment. However, the response is poor due to chemoresistance and toxicity. On the other hand, Pentoxifylline (PTX) is an unspecific inhibitor of phosphodiesterases; experimental, and clinically it has been described as sensitizing tumor cells to chemotherapy, increasing apoptosis and decreasing senescence.

Methods:   PC3 human prostate cancer cells were treated in vitro at different doses and times with PTX, DTX, or their combination. Viability was determined by the WST-1 assay by spectrophotometry, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, generic caspase activation and senescence by flow cytometry, DNA fragmentation and caspases-3, -8, and -9 activity by ELISA.  Results:   We found that PTX in PC3 human prostate cancer cells induces significant apoptosis per se and increases that generated by DTX, while at the same time it reduces the senescence caused by the chemotherapy and increases caspases-3,-8, and -9 activity in PTX + DTX-treated cells. Both treatments blocked the PC3 cell in the G1 phase.  Conclusions:   Our results show that PTX sensitizes prostate tumor cells to apoptosis induced by DTX. Taken together, the results support the concept of chemotherapy with rational molecular bases.""","""['Martha E Cancino-Marentes', 'Georgina Hernández-Flores', 'Pablo Cesar Ortiz-Lazareno', 'María Martha Villaseñor-García', 'Eduardo Orozco-Alonso', 'Erick Sierra-Díaz', 'Raúl Antonio Solís-Martínez', 'Claudia Carolina Cruz-Gálvez', 'Alejandro Bravo-Cuellar']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Pentoxifylline sensitizes human cervical tumor cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis by suppressing NF-kappa B and decreased cell senescence.', 'Sensitization of cervix cancer cells to Adriamycin by Pentoxifylline induces an increase in apoptosis and decrease senescence.', 'Effect of sodium phenylbutyrate on the sensitivity of PC3/DTX-resistant prostate cancer cells to docetaxel.', 'Low-dose Docetaxel Enhanced the Anticancer Effect of Temsirolimus by Overcoming Autophagy in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Multi-CpG linear regression models to accurately predict paclitaxel and docetaxel activity in cancer cell lines.', 'Interrogating colorectal cancer metastasis to liver: a search for clinically viable compounds and mechanistic insights in colorectal cancer Patient Derived Organoids.', 'Retinoblastoma: Review and new insights.']"""

Few case presentations describe this association; the novelty lies in the potentially lethal cardiovascular events among cancer patients receiving hormonal therapy.  Case presentation:   A 70-year-old male presented with recurrent syncope without prodrome. ECG revealed frequent ventricular ectopy, non-sustained episodes of TdP, and severe hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia. During potassium and magnesium infusion for repletion, the patient underwent temporary transvenous atrial pacing. As part of the work-up, coronary angiography revealed a mild coronary artery disease, and transthoracic echocardiogram showed a moderately depressed ejection fraction. After electrolyte disturbances were corrected, the QT interval normalized, and transvenous pacing was no longer necessary. Abiraterone was discontinued during the admission, and the patient returned to baseline.  Conclusions:   Cancer treatment is complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach.

To solve it efficiently, we propose a sequential convex programming algorithm that solves a sequence of convex optimization problems. Beginning by optimizing the aperture weights of many (72) evenly distributed beams using the beam's eye view of the target from each direction as the initial aperture shape, the search space is constrained to allowing the leaves to move within a pre-defined step-size. A convex approximation problem is introduced and solved to optimize the leaf positions and the aperture weights within the search space. The algorithm is equipped with both local and global search strategies, whereby a global search is followed by a local search: a large step-size results in a global search with a less accurate convex approximation, followed by a small step-size local search with an accurate convex approximation. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on three patients with three different disease sites (paraspinal, prostate and oligometastasis). The algorithm generates VMAT plans comparable to the ideal 72-beam fluence map optimized plans (i.e. IMRT plans before leaf sequencing) in 14 iterations and 36 mins on average. The algorithm is also tested on a small down-sampled prostate case for which we could computationally afford to obtain the ground-truth by solving the non-convex mixed-integer optimization problem exactly. This general algorithm is able to produce results essentially equivalent to the ground-truth but 12 times faster. The algorithm is also scalable and can handle real clinical cases, whereas the ground-truth solution using mixed-integer optimization can only be obtained for highly down-sampled cases.""","""['Pınar Dursun', 'Masoud Zarepisheh', 'Gourav Jhanwar', 'Joseph O Deasy']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Integrating soft and hard dose-volume constraints into hierarchical constrained IMRT optimization.', 'A comprehensive formulation for volumetric modulated arc therapy planning.', 'Technical Note: A fast inverse direct aperture optimization algorithm for volumetric-modulated arc therapy.', 'Direct leaf trajectory optimization for volumetric modulated arc therapy planning with sliding window delivery.', 'A fast optimization approach for treatment planning of volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Automated and Clinically Optimal Treatment Planning for Cancer Radiotherapy.']"""

Autoplanning can enhance plan quality compared to 'manual' trial-and-error planning, and decrease routine planning workload. A few approaches have been implemented in commercial treatment planning systems (TPSs). We performed a pre-clinical validation of a new system ('NovelATP') that is based on fully-automated multi-criterial optimization (MCO). The aim of NovelATP is to automatically generate for each patient a single high-quality, Pareto-optimal plan without manual Pareto navigation.  Material and methods:   Validation was performed by generating VMAT/IMRT plans for conventional treatment of prostate cancer (101 pts), prostate SBRT (20 pts), bilateral head-and-neck cancer (50 pts) and rectal cancer treated at an MR-Linac (23 pts). NovelATP autoplans were compared to plans that were generated with our in-house autoplanning system. In many previous validation studies, the latter system consistently showed enhanced plan quality when compared to manual planning.  Results:   Dosimetrical differences between NovelATP and benchmark plans were on average small and presumably not clinically relevant, pointing at high NovelATP dosimetric plan quality. MUs were 11-19% higher with NovelATP. NovelATP delivery times were up to 12% longer. Overall, there was a slight disadvantage for NovelATP regarding gamma analyses. Calculation times for NovelATP plans were between 29 and 151 min with no overall differences with the benchmark plans.  Conclusion:   The new autoplanning system was able to produce high-quality plans for four highly different planning protocols/treatment sites with a total of 194 patients investigated.""","""['Rik Bijman', 'Abdul Wahab Sharfo', 'Linda Rossi', 'Sebastiaan Breedveld', 'Ben Heijmen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Fully automated, multi-criterial planning for Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy - An international multi-center validation for prostate cancer.', 'First system for fully-automated multi-criterial treatment planning for a high-magnetic field MR-Linac applied to rectal cancer.', 'First fully automated planning solution for robotic radiosurgery - comparison with automatically planned volumetric arc therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Fully automated treatment planning for MLC-based robotic radiotherapy.', 'TBS-BAO: fully automated beam angle optimization for IMRT guided by a total-beam-space reference plan.', 'Comprehensive dosimetric and clinical evaluation of lexicographic optimization-based planning for cervical cancer.', 'Benchmarking daily adaptation using fully automated radiotherapy treatment plan optimization for rectal cancer.', 'Dose-volume-based evaluation of convolutional neural network-based auto-segmentation of thoracic organs at risk.', 'Treatment Planning in Intraoperative Radiation Therapy (IORT): Where Should We Go?', 'Automated Planning for Prostate Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy on the 1.5 T MR-Linac.']"""

Materials and methods:   A total of 197 patients with prostate cancer received RT, with a follow-up of ≥12 months. Biochemical failure was defined as PSA ≥nadir + 2 ng/mL after RT. We analyzed clinical outcomes, including survival, failure patterns, and prognostic factors affecting outcomes.  Results:   Biochemical failure-free survival (BCFFS), clinical failure-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival (OS) rates at 5 years were 91.1%, 95.4%, 96.9%, 99.5%, and 89.1%, respectively.

Nadir PSA ≤0.001 ng/mL was an independent prognostic factor for BCFFS (p = 0.006) and OS (p = 0.021). The use of long-term A-ADT significantly affected nadir PSA ≤0.001 ng/mL (p < 0.001). The patients with A-ADT for 1 year or longer had better BCFFS or OS than those for less than 1 year or those without A-ADT (p < 0.001). The best prognosis was demonstrated in patients treated with long-term A-ADT and nadir PSA ≤0.001 ng/mL in BCFFS (p < 0.001).

Methods:   Men diagnosed from June 2014 to December 2018 and enrolled in the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Registry-Victoria (PCOR-Vic) were included. Data collected include demographics, diagnosis method and institution, staging investigations and treatments within 12 months of diagnosis. Wilcoxon rank-sum, Chi-squared and trend tests were used to identify predictors of docetaxel utilisation. All predictors were entered as covariates simultaneously into a multivariable logistic regression model. Statistical significance was set at 0.05 (two sided).  Results:   In all, 1014 men with mHSPC were analysed, 25% of whom received docetaxel with androgen deprivation therapy. Uptake of docetaxel increased from 20% in 2014 to 33% in 2018.

Methods:   We investigated the methylation level of the VCL promoter based on the TCGA database. The knockdown efficacy of VCL gene expression was confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, and immunofluorescence. Furthermore, morphological changes in PCa cells were detected using phalloidin staining. The mobility of PCa cells was measured using transwell assays and high-content analysis. Moreover, cell growth and viability were determined using the colony formation and cell counting kit-8 assays. The role of VCL in tumor growth in vivo was investigated using a subcutaneous xenograft model generated by injecting tumor cells into the right flank of BALB/c nude mice.  Results:   The methylation level of the VCL promoter in PCa was significantly downregulated concomitant with age and the progression of nodal metastasis. VCL expression was markedly decreased by shRNA. Importantly, VCL knockdown significantly changed the cell morphology; inhibited the migration, invasion, and movement; and repressed colony formation and viability of PCa cells in vitro.

The more aggressive form of the disease has been attributed to androgen independence, resulting in a lack of response to androgen deprivation therapy and sustained activation of other growth pathways. The scaffold proteins β-arrestin 1 and 2 (βarr1 and βarr2), which are known to mediate G protein-coupled receptor desensitization and internalization, were also shown to modulate prostate tumorigenesis. βarr1 is significantly overexpressed (>4-fold) in PCa cells relative to βarr2. In this study, we investigated the effect of βarr1 overexpression in PCa development and progression using the mouse and human PCa cell xenografts, and autochthonous transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) models deficient in β-arrestin depletion of βarr1 in TRAMP mice (TRAMP/βarr1-/-) increased PCa growth and decreased overall survival relative to control TRAMP or TRAMP/βarr2-/- animals. Prostate tissues from TRAMP/βarr1-/- tumors displayed an increase in androgen receptor (AR) expression, whereas overexpression of βarr1 in TRAMP-C1 (TRAMP-C1-βarr1-GFP) which derived from TRAMP decreased AR expression, cell proliferation and tumor growth in nude mice xenografts, relative to control TRAMP-C1-GFP. Knockdown of βarr1 expression in human MDA PCa 2b cells (MDA PCa 2b-βarr1-/-) also decreased AR expression cell proliferation and tumor growth relative to control (MDA PCa 2b-Sham) cells. Interestingly, both TRAMP-C1-βarr1-GFP and MDA PCa 2b-βarr1-/- xenografts showed a decrease in AKT phosphorylation but an increase in MAPK activation.

Results:   Of 6,012 patients, 125 (2.1%) resided in RAs and 5,887 (97.9%) in UAs. RA patients were younger than UA patients (median age 72 vs. 75 years, p = 0.03).

Weekly treatment with ModraDoc006/r had been evaluated in phase I trials in patients with different types of advanced solid tumors, but up to this point in time not in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Aim:   We assessed safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ModraDoc006/r to establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) in patients with mCRPC.  Methods:   mCRPC patients, treatment naïve or following abiraterone or enzalutamide treatment, were included. Dose-escalation of ModraDoc006/r was based on safety and docetaxel PK. Antitumor activity was assessed by serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and radiological evaluation.  Results:   Cohort 1 (n = 5) received once weekly ModraDoc006 30 mg with ritonavir 100 mg in the morning, and ModraDoc006 20 mg with ritonavir 100 mg in the evening (30-20/100-100). The mean docetaxel area under the plasma concentration-time curve (mAUC0-inf) was 461 ng/mL × h with 1 dose limiting toxicity (DLT); grade 3 alanine transferase increase. In cohort 2 (n = 6, ModraDoc006/r 30-20/200-200), the mAUC0-inf was 1687 ng/mL × h with 2 DLTs; grade 3 diarrhea and mucositis. In cohort 3A (n = 6, ModraDoc006/r 30-20/200-100), the mAUC0-inf was 1517 ng/mL × h with 1 DLT; grade 3 diarrhea. In cohort 3B (n = 3, ModraDoc006/r 20-20/200-100), the mAUC0-inf was 558 ng/mL × h without DLTs. The mAUC0-inf exceeded estimated exposures of intravenous docetaxel in cohort 2 and 3A, was lower in cohort 1 and was in range in cohort 3B. PSA decreases of >50% occurred in 6/10 evaluable patients throughout the various cohorts. In five radiological evaluable patients, two confirmed partial responses were observed.  Conclusion:   The RP2D was established at weekly ModraDoc006/r 30-20/200-100. Observed PSA and radiological responses suggest promising clinical activity.

Purpose:   To compare the performance of a previously proposed deep learning algorithm, FocalNet, and expert radiologists in the detection of PCa on mpMRI with WMHP as the reference.  Study type:   Retrospective, single-center study.  Subjects:   A total of 553 patients (development cohort: 427 patients; evaluation cohort: 126 patients) who underwent 3-T mpMRI prior to radical prostatectomy from October 2010 to February 2018.  Field strength/sequence:   3-T, T2-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging.  Assessment:   FocalNet was trained on the development cohort to predict PCa locations by detection points, with a confidence value for each point, on the evaluation cohort. Four fellowship-trained genitourinary (GU) radiologists independently evaluated the evaluation cohort to detect suspicious PCa foci, annotate detection point locations, and assign a five-point suspicion score (1: least suspicious, 5: most suspicious) for each annotated detection point. The PCa detection performance of FocalNet and radiologists were evaluated by the lesion detection sensitivity vs. the number of false-positive detections at different thresholds on suspicion scores. Clinically significant lesions: Gleason Group (GG) ≥ 2 or pathological size ≥ 10 mm. Index lesions: the highest GG and the largest pathological size (secondary).  Statistical tests:   Bootstrap hypothesis test for the detection sensitivity between radiologists and FocalNet.  Results:   For the overall differential detection sensitivity, FocalNet was 5.1% and 4.7% below the radiologists for clinically significant and index lesions, respectively; however, the differences were not statistically significant (P = 0.413 and P = 0.282, respectively).  Data conclusion:   FocalNet achieved slightly lower but not statistically significant PCa detection performance compared with GU radiologists. Compared with radiologists, FocalNet demonstrated similar detection performance for a highly sensitive setting (suspicion score ≥ 1) or a highly specific setting (suspicion score = 5), while lower performance in between.

Here, we performed a bioinformatics analysis of a TCGA dataset (GS ≧8) to identify pathways upregulated in a prostate cancer cohort with short survival. When conducting bioinformatics analyses, the definition of factors such as ""overexpression"" and ""shorter survival"" is vital, as poor definition may lead to mis-estimations. To eliminate this possibility, we defined an expression cutoff value using an algorithm calculated by a Cox regression model, and the hazard ratio for each gene was set so as to identify genes whose expression levels were associated with shorter survival. Next, genes associated with shorter survival were entered into pathway analysis to identify pathways that were altered in a shorter survival cohort. We identified pathways involving upregulation of GRB2. Overexpression of GRB2 was linked to shorter survival in the TCGA dataset, a finding validated by histological examination of biopsy samples taken from the patients for diagnostic purposes.

Bladder filling before the administration of radiotherapy results in lower radiation exposure to the bladder. BladderScan, an ultrasound-based bladder volume scanner, has the potential to evaluate bladder volume during radiotherapy; thus, a prospective pilot study was initiated.  Methods:   Eleven men receiving tomotherapy for localized prostate cancer were enrolled. The validity of BladderScan was evaluated by comparing the measurements from BladderScan with the calculated volume from megavoltage computed tomography (MVCT). With a crossover design to compare different methods in bladder filling, the radiotherapy was divided into 2 sequences. Conventional method: the patient was asked to drink water after voiding urine. The amount of water and the duration of waiting were the same as in the setting of the simulation. BladderScan feedback method: the bladder filling procedure depended on the BladderScan measurements.  Results:   There were 314 sets of data from 11 patients. The correlation coefficient between VBS and VCT was 0.87, where VBS is the mean volume of 3 measurements by BladderScan and VCT is the bladder volume derived from MVCT. The BladderScan feedback method resulted in a significant larger bladder volume than the conventional method, with a mean difference of 36.9 mL. When the failure was defined as VCT <80% of planned volume, the BladderScan feedback method brought about a relative reduction in the failure rate with an odds ratio of 0.44 and an absolute reduction of 9.1%.  Conclusion:   The accuracy of BladderScan was validated by MVCT in our study.

However, HFRT may also increase the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) or genitourinary (GU) toxicity compared with conventionally fractionated radiation therapy (CFRT). Several large trials have found that HFRT is well tolerated in mixed risk population studies. Here, we report on a phase II, randomized controlled study conducted to evaluate these endpoints in exclusively high-risk patients with prostate cancer treated with prostate and pelvic nodal radiation.  Methods and materials:   After giving informed consent, patients with high-risk prostate cancer were randomly assigned to prostate plus pelvic nodal radiation therapy with either HFRT (68 Gy in 25 fractions) or CFRT (78 Gy in 39 fractions) and 18 months of androgen suppression therapy. Toxicity was scored using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0). Biochemical failure was determined by the Phoenix definition. Patients were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis.  Results:   From 2012 to 2018, 111 patients with high-risk prostate cancer were enrolled and 109 patients were treated. The cumulative incidence of grade 2 or higher acute GI toxicity was not significantly different between the arms (HFRT 18.9% vs CFRT 21.8%; P = .812). Similarly, acute GU (HFRT 30.2% vs CFRT 30.9%; P = 1.00), late GI (HFRT 16.0% vs CFRT 10.0%; P = .554), and late GU (HFRT 16.0% vs CFRT 6.0%; P = .200) were not significantly different between the arms. Median follow-up was 38.0 months (4.8-77.8 months). The 3-year biochemical recurrence-free survival was not significantly different between the 2 arms (97.3% for HFRT vs 91.0% for CFRT; P = .606). The 3-year overall survival was 94.8% in the HFRT arm and 100.0% in the CFRT arm (P = .116).

However, resistance eventually develops in virtually all patients, and various mechanisms have been associated with this process. The histone acetyltransferases EP300 and CREBBP are involved in regulation of cellular events in advanced prostate cancer. This study investigated the role of EP300/CREBBP inhibitors in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer. EP300/CREBBP inhibitors led to the same inhibition of androgen receptor activity in enzalutamide-resistant and -sensitive cells. However, enzalutamide-resistant cells were more sensitive to these inhibitors in viability assays. As indicated by the RNA-sequencing-based pathway analysis, genes related to the ribosome and MYC activity were significantly altered upon EP300/CREBBP inhibitor treatment. EP300/CREBBP inhibitors led to the down-regulation of ribosomal proteins RPL36 and RPL29. High-level ribosomal proteins amplifications and MYC amplifications were observed in castration-resistant prostate cancer samples of the publicly available Stand Up to Cancer data set. An inhibitor of RNA polymerase I-mediated transcription was used to evaluate the functional implications of these findings. The enzalutamide-resistant cell lines were more sensitive to this treatment. In addition, the migration rate of enzalutamide-resistant cells was strongly inhibited by this treatment. Taken together, the current data show that EP300/CREBBP inhibitors affect the MYC/ribosomal protein axis in enzalutamide-resistant cells and may have promising therapeutic implications.""","""['Tobias Furlan', 'Alexander Kirchmair', 'Natalie Sampson', 'Martin Puhr', 'Martina Gruber', 'Zlatko Trajanoski', 'Frédéric R Santer', 'Walther Parson', 'Florian Handle', 'Zoran Culig']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Am J Pathol""","""['CREBBP/EP300 bromodomains are critical to sustain the GATA1/MYC regulatory axis in proliferation.', 'Pharmacological and genetic targeting of 5-lipoxygenase interrupts c-Myc oncogenic signaling and kills enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells via apoptosis.', 'Role of solute carrier transporters SLC25A17 and SLC27A6 in acquired resistance to enzalutamide in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Mechanisms of enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer and therapeutic strategies to overcome it.', 'Androgen Receptor Coactivators in Regulation of Growth and Differentiation in Prostate Cancer.', 'A GATA2-CDC6 axis modulates androgen receptor blockade-induced senescence in prostate cancer.', 'Ribosome-Directed Therapies in Cancer.', 'The Acquired Vulnerability Caused by CDK4/6 Inhibition Promotes Drug Synergism Between Oxaliplatin and Palbociclib in Cholangiocarcinoma.', 'TWIST1-EP300 Expedites Gastric Cancer Cell Resistance to Apatinib by Activating the Expression of COL1A2.', 'A comprehensive characterization of the transcriptome in enzalutamide resistance prostate cancer.']"""

A database of clinical data on people with cancer, CancerLinQ, is operated by the ASCO and collected from practices across the United States and multiple electronic health records.  Methods:   To attempt to identify transgender people with cancer within CancerLinQ, we used three criteria: (1) International Classification of Diseases 9/10 diagnosis (Dx) code suggestive of transgender identity; (2) male gender and Dx of cervical, endometrial, ovarian, fallopian tube, or other related cancer; and (3) female gender and Dx of prostate, testicular, penile, or other related cancer. Charts were abstracted to confirm transgender identity.  Results:   Five hundred fifty-seven cases matched inclusion criteria and two hundred and forty-two were abstracted. Seventy-six percent of patients with Dx codes suggestive of transgender identity were transgender. Only 2% and 3% of the people identified by criteria 2 and 3 had evidence of transgender identity, respectively. Extrapolating to nonabstracted data, we would expect to identify an additional four individuals in category 2 and an additional three individuals in category 3, or a total of 44. The total population in CancerLinQ is approximately 1,300,000. Thus, our methods could identify 0.003% of the total population as transgender.  Conclusion:   Given the need for data regarding transgender people with cancer and the deficiencies of current data resources, a national concerted effort is needed to prospectively collect gender identity data. These efforts will require systemic efforts to create safe healthcare environments for transgender people.""","""['Ash B Alpert', 'George A Komatsoulis', 'Stephen C Meersman', 'Elizabeth Garrett-Mayer', 'Suanna S Bruinooge', 'Robert S Miller', 'Danielle Potter', 'Becky Koronkowski', 'Edward Stepanski', 'Don S Dizon']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""JCO Oncol Pract""","""[""Seeing the unseen: how can we best identify transgender women within the Veterans Affairs healthcare system's electronic medical record?"", 'A novel method for estimating transgender status using electronic medical records.', 'Research priorities for gender nonconforming/transgender youth: gender identity development and biopsychosocial outcomes.', 'Development of CancerLinQ, a Health Information Learning Platform From Multiple Electronic Health Record Systems to Support Improved Quality of Care.', 'My preferred pronoun is she: Understanding transgender identity and oral health care needs.', '""Everything\'s a fight"": A qualitative study of the cancer survivorship experiences of transgender and gender diverse Australians.', 'Secondary Prevention of Cervical Cancer: ASCO Resource-Stratified Guideline Update.']"""

Nevertheless, the regulatory mechanism underlying SOX9 upregulation still remains unclear. Several cytokines have been reported to be involved in the regulation of SOX9, suggesting that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), one of the main sources of secreted factors in the tumor microenvironment (TME), may play a role in regulating SOX9 expression. Herein, an in vitro model of paracrine interaction between primary CAFs and Pca cells was applied to investigate the molecular mechanism of SOX9 upregulation during Pca progression. The regulatory axis was validated by in vivo experiments and The Cancer Genome Atlas data. Conditional medium of CAFs (CAF-CM) upregulated the expression of SOX9, which was mutually proved to be essential for CAF-induced tumor progression. Further analysis showed that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) secreted by CAFs was responsible for SOX9 elevation in Pca cells, via the activation of c-Met signaling. Mechanistically, HGF/c-Met signaling specifically activated MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway, which induced phosphorylation and upregulation of FRA1, which then transcriptionally upregulated SOX9 by binding to the promoter of SOX9 gene. Moreover, we identified that HGF/c-Met-ERK1/2-FRA1-SOX9 axis was relatively conserved between human and mouse species by validating in mouse Pca cells. Our results reveal a novel insight into the molecular mechanism that SOX9 in Pca cells is promoted by CAFs through HGF/c-Met-ERK1/2-FRA1 axis. Furthermore, SOX9 may serve as an alternative marker for the activated HGF/c-Met signaling to enroll the optimal Pca patients for HGF/c-Met inhibition treatment, since it is much more stable and easier to detect.""","""['Haixiang Qin', 'Yang Yang', 'Bo Jiang', 'Chun Pan', 'Wei Chen', 'Wenli Diao', 'Meng Ding', 'Wenmin Cao', 'Zhenxing Zhang', 'Mengxia Chen', 'Jie Gao', 'Xiaozhi Zhao', 'Xuefeng Qiu', 'Hongqian Guo']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""FEBS J""","""['Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Regulate Tumor-Initiating Cell Plasticity in Hepatocellular Carcinoma through c-Met/FRA1/HEY1 Signaling.', 'Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Promote Radioresistance of Breast Cancer Cells via the HGF/c-Met Signaling Pathway.', 'Keratin 19 Expression in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Is Regulated by Fibroblast-Derived HGF via a MET-ERK1/2-AP1 and SP1 Axis.', 'Roles of the HGF/Met signaling in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: Focus on tumor immunity (Review).', 'Hepatocyte growth factor/MET in cancer progression and biomarker discovery.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblasts in gynecological malignancies: are they really allies of the enemy?', 'Targeting c-Met in the treatment of urologic neoplasms: Current status and challenges.', 'Small ankyrin 1 (sANK1) promotes docetaxel resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells by enhancing oxidative phosphorylation.', 'Small Extracellular Vesicles and Their Involvement in Cancer Resistance: An Up-to-Date Review.', 'Prognostic value of SOX9 in cervical cancer: Bioinformatics and experimental approaches.']"""

We evaluated the overall survival (OS) and skeletal-related events (SREs) among men who received radium-223 with or without concomitant abiraterone or enzalutamide in the Veterans Affairs (VA) Health System.  Methods:   We reviewed charts of all mCRPC patients who received radium-223 in the VA from January 2013 to September 2017. We used Cox models to test the association between concomitant therapy versus radium-223 alone on OS and SRE. Sensitivity analyses were performed for concomitant use of denosumab/bisphosphonates.  Results:   Three hundred and eighteen patients treated with radium-223 were identified; 116/318 (37%) received concomitant abiraterone/enzalutamide. Two hundred and seventy-seven (87%) patients died during follow-up. Patients who received concomitant therapy were younger at radium-223 initiation (median age 68 vs. 70, p = .027) and had a longer follow-up (median 29.5 vs. 17.9 months, p = .030). There was no OS benefit for those on concomitant therapy (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.67-1.12, p = .28). There was a trend for an increased SRE risk for patients on concomitant therapy (HR: 1.87, 95% CI: 0.96-3.61, p = .066), but this was not significant.

Whereas denosumab has never been studied in this patient population, zoledronic acid has been shown to be ineffective in decreasing the risk for skeletal-related events. This study estimates the prevalence and economic consequences of real-world use of bone-targeted agents for mCSPC patients in Switzerland.  Methods:   To estimate the frequency of bone-targeted agent administration and skeletal-related events, data from a non-interventional, cross-sectional survey involving oncologists across Switzerland (SAKK 95/16) was combined with data from the Swiss National Institute for Cancer Epidemiology and Registration (NICER). Economic parameters were calculated from the perspective of the healthcare system over the median time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression for the extrapolated patient group, using data from NICER. The cost calculation covered costs for bone-targeted agents, their administration and skeletal-related events. The time to PSA progression (33.2 months), as well as the probability and cost of skeletal-related events were derived from the literature.  Results:   The survey was answered by 86 physicians treating 417 patients, of whom 106 (25.4%) had prostate cancer, with 36 (34.0%) of these mCSPC. The majority of mCSPC patients (52.8%, n = 19) received bone-targeted agents monthly. Denosumab was the treatment of choice in 84.2% of patients (n = 16). Extrapolation using data from NICER indicated that 568 mCSPC patients may be treated with bone-targeted agents at doses used for bone metastasis &nbsp;every year in Switzerland, leading to estimated total costs of more than CHF 8.3 million over 33.2 months. Because of its more frequent prescription and higher price, it appears that almost 93% of the total costs can be attributed to denosumab. For both denosumab and zoledronic acid, the most expensive components were the cost of administration and the drug cost, making up more than 90% of the total costs, with the rest being costs of skeletal-related events.  Conclusions:   This study found that the administration of bone-targeted agents in doses used for bone-metastatic diseases to prevent skeletal-related events is frequent in the setting of mCSPC and results in significant costs for the healthcare system.""","""['Sandro Tiziano Stoffel', 'Roger von Moos', 'Beat Thürlimann', 'Richard Cathomas', 'Silke Gillessen', 'Ursina Zürrer-Härdi', 'Thomas von Briel', 'Sandro Anchisi', 'Anita Feller', 'Corinne Schär', 'Daniel Dietrich', 'Matthias Schwenkglenks', 'Judith E Lupatsch', 'Michael Thomas Mark']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Swiss Med Wkly""","""['Economic evaluation of denosumab compared with zoledronic acid in hormone-refractory prostate cancer patients with bone metastases.', 'Cost-effectiveness of denosumab vs zoledronic acid for prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with solid tumors and bone metastases in the United States.', 'Cost-effectiveness of denosumab as a bone protective agent for patients with castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Denosumab versus zoledronic acid for treatment of bone metastases in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer: a randomised, double-blind study.', 'Health-economic review of zoledronic acid for the management of skeletal-related events in bone-metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Real-world use of bone modifying agents in metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'RE: Real-World Use of Bone Modifying Agents in Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer.']"""

MPSSS, a novel polysaccharide purified from Lentinus edodes, has been reported to have anti-tumor activity. MPSSS could also inhibit the immunosuppressive function of prostate CAFs, which has been demonstrated through that the secretome of MPSSS-treated prostate CAFs could inhibit the proliferation of T cells. However, how the secretome of MPSSS-treated prostate CAFs influence prostate cancer progression is still unclear. Interestingly, we found that the low molecular weight (3-100kD) secretome of prostate CAFs (lmwCAFS) could promote the growth of PC-3 cells, while that of MPSSS-treated prostate CAFs (MT-lmwCAFS) could inhibit their growth. We carried out comparative secretomic analysis of lmwCAFS and MT-lmwCAFS to identify functional molecules that inhibit the growth of PC-3 cells, and proteomic analysis of lmwCAFS-treated PC-3 cells and MT-lmwCAFS-treated PC-3 cells to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism. These analyses suggest that TGF-β3 from MT-lmwCAFS may inhibit the growth of PC-3 cells. The validated experiments revealed that TGF-β3 from MT-lmwCAFS activated p21 expression in PC-3 cells by regulating the FoxO pathway thereby inducing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest of PC-3 cells.

Objective:   To evaluate the benefit-harm profiles and cost-effectiveness associated with MRI before biopsy compared with biopsy-first screening for prostate cancer using age-based and risk-stratified screening strategies.  Design, setting, and participants:   This decision analytical model used a life-table approach and was conducted between December 2019 and July 2020. A hypothetical cohort of 4.48 million men in England aged 55 to 69 years were analyzed and followed-up to 90 years of age.  Exposures:   No screening, age-based screening, and risk-stratified screening in the hypothetical cohort. Age-based screening consisted of screening every 4 years with prostate-specific antigen between the ages of 55 and 69 years. Risk-stratified screening used age and polygenic risk profiles.  Main outcomes and measures:   The benefit-harm profile (deaths from prostate cancer, quality-adjusted life-years, overdiagnosis, and biopsies) and cost-effectiveness (net monetary benefit, from a health care system perspective) were analyzed. Both age-based and risk-stratified screening were evaluated using a biopsy-first and an MRI-first diagnostic pathway. Results were derived from probabilistic analyses and were discounted at 3.5% per annum.  Results:   The hypothetical cohort included 4.48 million men in England, ranging in age from 55 to 69 years (median, 62 years). Compared with biopsy-first age-based screening, MRI-first age-based screening was associated with 0.9% (1368; 95% uncertainty interval [UI], 1370-1409) fewer deaths from prostate cancer, 14.9% (12 370; 95% UI, 11 100-13 670) fewer overdiagnoses, and 33.8% (650 500; 95% UI, 463 200-907 000) fewer biopsies. At 10-year absolute risk thresholds of 2% and 10%, MRI-first risk-stratified screening was associated with between 10.4% (7335; 95% UI, 6630-8098) and 72.6% (51 250; 95% UI, 46 070-56 890) fewer overdiagnosed cancers, respectively, and between 21.7% fewer MRIs (412 100; 95% UI, 411 400-412 900) and 53.5% fewer biopsies (1 016 000; 95% UI, 1 010 000-1 022 000), respectively, compared with MRI-first age-based screening. The most cost-effective strategies at willingness-to-pay thresholds of £20 000 (US $26 000) and £30 000 (US $39 000) per quality-adjusted life-year gained were MRI-first risk-stratified screening at 10-year absolute risk thresholds of 8.5% and 7.5%, respectively.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this decision analytical model of a hypothetical cohort, an MRI-first diagnostic pathway was associated with an improvement in the benefit-harm profile and cost-effectiveness of screening for prostate cancer compared with biopsy-first screening.

Yet, data on cancer in this population are limited. We examined cancer stage at diagnosis, treatment, and survival among transgender patients compared with cisgender patients in the National Cancer Database (NCDB).  Methods:   Gender (male, female, or transgender) was extracted from medical records from patients diagnosed with cancer between 2003 and 2016. Logistic regression estimated odds ratios (ORs) for the associations between gender and stage at diagnosis and treatment receipt. Cox proportional hazards regression estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for associations between gender and all-cause survival.  Results:   Among 11 776 699 persons with cancer in NCDB, 589 were transgender. Compared with cisgender patients, transgender patients may be more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage lung cancer (OR = 1.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.95 to 3.28); be less likely to receive treatment for kidney (OR = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.08 to 0.47) and pancreas (OR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.11 to 0.95) cancers; and have poorer survival after diagnosis with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (HR = 2.34, 95% CI = 1.51 to 3.63), prostate (HR = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.06 to 3.45), and bladder cancers (HR = 2.86, 95% CI = 1.36 to 6.00). Similar associations were found for other cancer sites, although not statistically significant.  Conclusion:   Transgender patients may be diagnosed at later stages, be less likely to receive treatment, and have worse survival for many cancer types. Small sample size hampered our ability to detect statistically significant differences for some cancer sites.

Objective:   To compare toxic effect profiles, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responses, and quality-of-life end points of SDRT vs extreme hypofractionated SBRT.  Design, setting, and participants:   The PROSINT single-institution phase 2 randomized clinical trial accrued, between September 2015 and January 2017, 30 participants with intermediate-risk prostate cancer to receive SDRT or extreme hypofractionated SBRT. Androgen deprivation therapy was not permitted. Data were analyzed from March to May 2020.  Interventions:   Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 5 × 9 Gy SBRT (control arm) or 24 Gy SDRT (test arm).  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary end point was toxic effects; the secondary end points were PSA response, PSA relapse-free survival, and patient-reported quality of life measured with the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC)-26 questionnaires.  Results:   A total of 30 men were randomized; median (interquartile range) age was 66.3 (61.2-69.9) and 73.6 (64.7-75.9) years for the SBRT and SDRT arms, respectively. Time to appearance and duration of acute and late toxic effects were similar in the 2 trial arms. Cumulative late actuarial urinary toxic effects did not differ for grade 1 (hazard ratio [HR], 0.41; 90% CI, 0.13-1.27) and grade 2 or greater (HR, 1.07; 90% CI, 0.21-5.57). Actuarial grade 1 late gastrointestinal (GI) toxic effects were comparable (HR, 0.37; 90% CI, 0.07-1.94) and there were no grade 2 or greater late GI toxic effects. Declines in PSA level to less than 0.5 ng/mL occurred by 36 months in both study arms. No PSA relapses occurred in favorable intermediate-risk disease, while in the unfavorable category, the actuarial 4-year PSA relapse-free survival values were 75.0% vs 64.0% (HR, 0.76; 90% CI, 0.17-3.31) for SBRT vs SDRT, respectively. The EPIC-26 median summary scores for the genitourinary and GI domains dropped transiently at 1 month and returned to pretreatment scores by 3 months in both arms. The IPSS-derived transient late urinary flare symptoms occurred at 9 to 18 months in 20% (90% CI, 3%-37%) of patients receiving SDRT.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this randomized clinical trial among patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer, SDRT was safe and associated with low toxicity, and the tumor control and quality-of-life end points closely match the SBRT arm outcomes.

This study aimed to: (1) describe prostate cancer-related out-of-pocket costs and perceived financial burden, and (2) identify factors associated with such a perceived burden among prostate cancer patients living in a remote region of the province of Quebec (Canada). Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 171 prostate cancer patients who consulted at the outpatient clinic of the Centre Hospitalier de Rouyn-Noranda. Results: The majority of patients (83%) had incurred out-of-pocket costs for their cancer care. The mean total cost incurred in the last three months was $517 and 22.3% reported a moderate, considerable or unsustainable burden. Multivariable analysis revealed that having incurred higher cancer-related out-of-pocket costs (OR: 1.001; 95%CI: 1.001-1.002) private drug insurance (vs. public, OR: 5.23; 95%CI: 1.13-24.17) was associated with a greater perceived financial burden.

MET-RADS-P is a subjective assessment-based reporting system proposed to standardize the interpretation of WB-DWI. However, a quantitative evaluation of WB-DWI has not been fully investigated.  Purpose:   To investigate the validity, and analyze the prognostic value, of quantitative evaluation of WB-DWI based on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values for CRPC.  Study type:   Retrospective.  Population:   Sixty-six patients with CRPC. The median age was 75 years. During the median follow-up period of 25.2 months, 23 of 66 patients (34.8%) died of prostate cancer.  Field strength/sequence:   A 1.5 T WB-DWI was used with two b-values (0 s/mm2 -1000 s/mm2 ). A single-shot echo-planar imaging sequence was used.  Assessment:   WB-DWI were evaluated by three readers according to MET-RADS-P scoring system. Using imaging software, Attractive BDScore, tumor diffusion volume (mDV) and ADC value of metastatic lesion (mADC) was calculated by two readers. The mDV was calculated with ADC values (×10-3 mm2 /sec) of 0.4-0.9 (mDV0.4-0.9 ), 0.9-1.4 (mDV0.9-1.4 ), and 1.4-1.8 (mDV1.4-1.8 ), respectively.  Statistical tests:   Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to assess the correlation. The relationships between the variables with cancer-specific survival (CSS) were evaluated. Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model.  Results:   mDVs showed a strong positive correlation with MET-RADS-P scores (r = 0.90/0.87, P < 0.05 for both). mDV showed a statistically significant association with CSS (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.01, P < 0.05). When the mDVs calculated based on the ADC values were included, mDV0.4-0.9 (HR: 1.02, P < 0.05) and the number of therapeutic lines (HR: 1.35, P < 0.05) were significant independent indicators of CSS shortening.  Conclusion:   Assessment of metastatic tumor volume based on ADC values can be used in the prognostic evaluation of patients with CRPC. WB-DWI might be a potential prognostic imaging biomarker for CRPC.

LNCaP cells were treated with AST alone and in combination with CH223191 and flutamide (Flu) in the presence and absence of testosterone. MTT assay, cellular prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) production, mRNA levels of CYP1A1, PSA, Kallikrein-Related Peptidase 2 (KLK2), Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2), and AR genes were measured as endpoints. The expression of CYP1A1, PSA, KLK2, TMPRSS2, and AR mRNA levels was decreased which results in reducing the production of PSA and DHT in the presence of testosterone. Our data clearly demonstrate that AST has a potential ability to suppress the human prostate LNCaP cells growth at high concentrations. AST was able to repress the testosterone-induced transcription of AR-target genes. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Astaxanthin is a natural compound with the most potent antioxidant activity among other antioxidants. In the current study, ASX suppressed the LNCaP cells at high concentrations. Furthermore, AST inhibited testosterone-induced transcriptional activation of androgen-related genes. AST induced the expression of CYP1A1, which is able to metabolize the steroid hormones. It seems that AST can act as AhR exogenous ligand by induction of CYP1A1, which results in testosterone metabolism and consequent suppression of AR genes. So that, AST could prevent the growth of testosterone-dependent PCa cells, downregulate downstream genes in testosterone pathways, and enhance the metabolism of testosterone via AhR pathway.

Methods:   The clinical data of 67 CRPC patients with 133 lesions treated with 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT-based SBRT were retrospectively analyzed. All of the patients had oligoprogressive disease during androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). The prognostic factors for overall- (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) and the predictive factors for switching to next-line systemic treatment (NEST) and NEST-free survival (NEST-FS) were analyzed.  Results:   With a median follow-up of 17.5 months, the 2-year overall survival (OS) and PFS rates were 86.9% and 34.4%, respectively. The PSA response was observed in 49 patients (73.1%). Progression was observed in 37 patients (55.2%) at a median of 11.0 months following SBRT. A total of 45 patients (67.2%) remained on ADT after SBRT, and 22 patients (32.8%) had a NEST change at a median of 16.4 months after metastasis-directed treatment (MDT). Patients with a NEST change had higher post-SBRT PSA values and fewer PSA nadirs after MDT than their counterparts. In multivariate analysis, higher pre-SBRT PSA values were the only significant predictor for worse OS and NEST-FS, and no significant factor was found for PFS. No serious acute or late toxicities were observed.

Diets high in glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) have been linked to several cancers, but epidemiologic studies of ovarian cancer have yielded inconsistent results.  Objective:   In this study, we aimed to examine associations between GI or GL and ovarian cancer.  Methods:   We used prospective data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian cohort. GI and GL were calculated from validated FFQs. Participants were women who were aged 60 to 74 y, did not have a history of cancer, and had both ovaries. Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate HRs and 95% CIs for risk of ovarian cancer associated with quartiles of GI and GL. Analyses were performed separately for those who completed the dietary questionnaire at baseline (DQX) or later in the study (DHQ).  Results:   From the DQX sample set, 181 cases were identified among 24,633 women with median follow-up of 12.1 y; there were 211 cases among 42,410 women in the DHQ set, with median follow-up of 8.9 y. After adjusting for age at dietary questionnaire completion, year of randomization, year of questionnaire, study center, and oral contraceptive use, the risk of ovarian cancer decreased by 43% (HR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.37, 0.88) among those in the highest compared with those in the lowest quartile of GL (DQX). Those in the highest compared with those in the lowest quartile of GI (DHQ), had a 38% lower risk (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.42, 1.00).

Despite evidence suggesting strong familial clustering of non-syndromic NMTC, known variants still account for a very small percentage of the genetic burden. In a recent whole genome sequencing (WGS) study of five families with several NMTCs, we shortlisted promising variants with the help of our in-house developed Familial Cancer Variant Prioritization Pipeline (FCVPPv2). Here, we report potentially disease-causing variants in checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2), Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 (EWSR1) and T-lymphoma invasion and metastasis-inducing protein 1 (TIAM1) in one family. Performing WGS on three cases, one probable case and one healthy individual in a family with familial NMTC left us with 112254 variants with a minor allele frequency of less than 0.1%, which was reduced by pedigree-based filtering to 6368. Application of the pipeline led to the prioritization of seven coding and nine non-coding variants from this family. The variant identified in CHEK2, a known tumor suppressor gene involved in DNA damage-induced DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis, has been previously identified as a germline variant in breast and prostate cancer and has been functionally validated by Roeb et al. in a yeast-based assay to have an intermediate effect on protein function. We thus hypothesized that this family may harbor additional disease-causing variants in other functionally related genes. We evaluated two further variants in EWSR1 and TIAM1 with promising in silico results and reported interaction in the DNA-damage repair pathway. Hence, we propose a polygenic mode of inheritance in this family. As familial NMTC is considered to be more aggressive than its sporadic counterpart, it is important to identify such susceptibility genes and their associated pathways. In this way, the advancement of personalized medicine in NMTC patients can be fostered. We also wish to reopen the discussion on monogenic vs polygenic inheritance in NMTC and instigate further development in this area of research.""","""['Aayushi Srivastava', 'Sara Giangiobbe', 'Diamanto Skopelitou', 'Beiping Miao', 'Nagarajan Paramasivam', 'Chiara Diquigiovanni', 'Elena Bonora', 'Kari Hemminki', 'Asta Försti', 'Obul Reddy Bandapalli']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)""","""['Identification of Rare Variants Predisposing to Thyroid Cancer.', 'Whole Genome Sequencing of Familial Non-Medullary Thyroid Cancer Identifies Germline Alterations in MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT Signaling Pathways.', 'A Germline CHEK2 Mutation in a Family with Papillary Thyroid Cancer.', 'CHEK2 Germline Variants in Cancer Predisposition: Stalemate Rather than Checkmate.', 'Genetic susceptibility to hereditary non-medullary thyroid cancer.', 'Identification of Novel Candidate Genes for Familial Thyroid Cancer by Whole Exome Sequencing.', 'Whole exome sequencing identifies novel germline variants of SLC15A4 gene as potentially cancer predisposing in familial colorectal cancer.', 'Susceptibility Genes and Chromosomal Regions Associated With Non-Syndromic Familial Non-Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma: Some Pathogenetic and Diagnostic Keys.', 'Germline pathogenic variants in cancer risk genes among patients with thyroid cancer and suspected predisposition.', 'Identification of NID1 as a novel candidate susceptibility gene for familial non-medullary thyroid carcinoma using whole-exome sequencing.']"""

Hence, identification of factors involved in the regulation of AR expression and function is a necessary first-step to improve disease outcome. In this study, we identified ubiquitous βArrestin 1 (βArr1) as a regulator of AR function in CRPC. Unbiased gene expression analysis of public datasets revealed increased levels of ARRB1 (the gene encoding βArr1) in CRPC when compared to normal tissue. Further, βArr1 expression correlated with enhanced AR transcriptional function in these datasets. The βArr1 partitions to both nucleus and cytosol and mechanistic studies showed that nuclear, and not cytosolic, βArr1 formed a complex with AR and AR-coregulator βCatenin and that the heterotrimeric protein complex was recruited to androgen-response elements of AR-regulated genes. Functionally, we demonstrate that depletion of βArr1 attenuates PC cell and tumor growth and metastasis, and rescued expression of nuclear, but not cytosolic, βArr1 restores the PC colony growth and invasion of Matrigel in vitro and tumor growth and metastasis in mice.

Methods:   Human tissues, cell lines and in vivo experiments were used to determine whether and how N-cadherin impacts the production of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and indole amine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1) and whether N-cadherin can increase the production of effector (e)Treg cells. Then, we used PC3-bearing humanized non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency IL2Rγnull (hNSG) mice with an intravenous injection of human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells into the tail vein to evaluate whether the N-cadherin antagonist N-Ac-CHAVC-NH2 (designated ADH-1) could improve the therapeutic effect of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL)-related treatment.  Results:   N-cadherin dramatically upregulated the expression of PD-L1 and IDO-1 through IFN-γ (interferongamma) signaling and increasing the production of free fatty acids that could promote the generation of eTreg cells. In preclinical experiments, immune reconstitution mediated by TILs slowed tumor growth and extended the survival time; however, this effect disappeared after immune system suppression by PD-L1, IDO-1 and eTreg cells. Furthermore, ADH-1 effectively reduced immunosuppression and enhanced TIL-related therapy.  Conclusions:   These data show that the N-cadherin antagonist ADH-1 promotes TIL antitumor responses.

Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) can act as an oncogene in OSCC. This study intended to investigate whether lncRNA prostatic androgen-regulated transcription 1 (PART1) can exert its role in OSCC by regulating EZH2. The expression of PART1 in OSCC samples, tumour tissues or OSCC cell lines was detected by qRT-PCR. The proliferation and apoptosis of OSCC cells were detected by CCK-8 and flow cytometry assays, respectively. The expression of PART1 and EZH2 was highly expressed in clinical OSCC tumours and cell lines. The expression level of PART1 was positively correlated to the size, clinical stage and node metastasis of OSCC patients. Functionally, PART1 knockdown inhibited proliferation and facilitated apoptosis of OSCC cells. Mechanically, fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS) interacted with PART1 and EZH2. In addition, PART1 knockdown reduced the mRNA expression of EZH2, which was offset by FUS overexpression.

Methods:   Data were collected from the population-based registry in Guangzhou. Age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) were calculated and Joinpoint regression was used for evaluating the average annual percent changes (AAPC) among the entire study period and the estimated annual percent changes (EAPC) in time segments. The effects of age, period, and birth cohort were assessed by the age-period-cohort model.  Results:   The age-standardized incidence and mortality by the world standard population decreased significantly among males with AAPC of -1.7% (95% CI: -3.0%, 0.2%) and -2.7% (95% CI: -4.3%, -1.1%) for all malignancies during 2004-2015, while among females, the age-standardized incidence had a non-significant reduction with AAPC of -1.3% (95% CI: -2.8%, 0.2%) and the age-standardized mortality demonstrated a remarkable decline (AAPC -2.0%, 95% CI: -3.6%, -0.3%). For males, the most commonly diagnosed cancers were trachea, bronchus, and lung (TBL), liver, colorectal, nasopharyngeal, stomach, and prostate cancer. For females, breast, TBL, colorectal, liver stomach, and thyroid cancer ranked the top. Unfavorable trends were observed in ASIR of colorectal, thyroid, and prostate cancer. APC models yielded different ages, periods, and birth cohort effect patterns by cancer sites.

Their effects differ by the initial flare of gonadotropin and testosterone secretion with agonists and the immediate pituitary-testicular suppression by antagonists. While both suppress luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) initially, a rebound in FSH levels occurs during agonist treatment. This rebound is potentially harmful, taken the expression of FSH receptors (R) in prostate cancer tissue. We herein assessed the role of FSH in promoting the growth of androgen-independent (PC-3, DU145) and androgen-dependent (VCaP) human prostate cancer cell line xenografts in nude mice. Gonadotropins were suppressed with the GnRH antagonist degarelix, and effects of add-back human recombinant FSH were assessed on tumor growth. All tumors expressed GnRHR and FSHR, and degarelix treatment suppressed their growth. FSH supplementation reversed the degarelix-evoked suppression of PC-3 tumors, both in preventive (degarelix and FSH treatment started upon cell inoculation) and therapeutic (treatments initiated 3 weeks after cell inoculation) setting. A less marked, though significant FSH effect occurred in DU145, but not in VCaP xenografts. FSHR expression in the xenografts supports direct FSH stimulation of tumor growth. Testosterone supplementation, to maintain the VCaP xenografts, apparently masked the FSH effect on their growth. Treatment with the LH analogue hCG did not affect PC-3 tumor growth despite their expression of luteinizing hormone/choriongonadotropin receptor. In conclusion, FSH, but not LH, may directly stimulate the growth of androgen-independent prostate cancer, suggesting that persistent FSH suppression upon GnRH antagonist treatment offers a therapeutic advantage over agonist.""","""['Olayiwola O Oduwole', 'Ariel Poliandri', 'Anthony Okolo', 'Phil Rawson', 'Milena Doroszko', 'Marcin Chrusciel', 'Nafis A Rahman', 'Gilberto Serrano de Almeida', 'Charlotte L Bevan', 'Wolfgang Koechling', 'Ilpo T Huhtaniemi']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""FASEB J""","""['FSH suppression and tumour control in patients with prostate cancer during androgen deprivation with a GnRH agonist or antagonist.', 'Gonadotropin-releasing hormone and its agonist inhibit testicular luteinizing hormone receptor and steroidogenesis in immature and adult hypophysectomized rats.', 'Developments in the control of testicular function.', 'Gonadotropins.', 'Regulation of testicular steroidogenesis by gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists and antagonists.', 'Construction of a Humanized PBMC-PDX Model to Study the Efficacy of a Bacterial Marker in Lung Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'Effectiveness of GnRH Antagonists and Agonists in Patients with Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer: A Retrospective Study.', 'Impact of add-back FSH on human and mouse prostate following gonadotropin ablation by GnRH antagonist treatment.', 'Follicle-Stimulating Hormone Induces Lipid Droplets via Gαi/o and β-Arrestin in an Endometrial Cancer Cell Line.']"""

This study was designed to investigate the association between sleep difficulties and cognitive depression in PCa patients. A sample of 96 PCa patients completed a background questionnaire, the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, and the Insomnia Severity Index. Comparison was made between sleep difficulty scores from before the patients received their diagnosis of PCa to the time of survey, allowing use of a ""retrospective pretest"" methodology. Just over 61% of the sample reported a deterioration in sleep quality, and this was significantly associated with cognitive depression (r = .346, p = .007). At the specific symptom level, having a clear mind significantly contributed to the variance in difficulty falling asleep (R2 change = .140, F for change = 9.298, p = .003).

Several treatment modalities for symptomatic lymphoceles are available, including percutaneous drainage, sclerosing agents, and surgical marsupialization, typically performed by laparoscopy or with a multiport robotic platform. The advantage of surgical approach is permanent excision of the lymphocele capsule and fewer days with pelvic drains compared to percutaneous drainage. This study aims to describe and illustrate, for the first time, the step-by-step surgical management of symptomatic lymphoceles using a less invasive robotic platform, the da Vinci® Single Port (SP). Materials and Methods: We describe the outcomes of three patients who underwent lymphocelectomy and marsupialization with the da Vinci SP for symptomatic lymphoceles after RARP and PLND with the da Vinci Xi. Results: Operative time for cases 1, 2, and 3 was 84, 80, and 79 minutes. The blood loss for each surgery was 25 mL. Patient 2 was discharged in 3 days, whereas patients 1 and 3 were discharged in 4 days. No intraoperative or postoperative complications were reported. All patients had their drain removed in under 24 hours after surgery. The mean follow-up period was 7.7 months (3.5-15.8). No patients were readmitted or had lymphocele recurrence.

Understanding the factors associated with referral to bone specialists may help to define future interventions to improve access to osteoporosis care for male patients.  Methods:   We conducted a retrospective analysis of a nationwide cohort (DeFRACalc79 database).

Results:   Median age at last follow-up/prostate cancer death was 78.0 (IQR: 72.3-84.1) and 81.4 (75.4-86.3) years, respectively. On univariable analysis, PHS46 (HR 3.41 [95% CI 2.78-4.17]), family history (HR 1.72 [1.46-2.03]), alcohol (HR 1.74 [1.40-2.15]), diabetes (HR 0.53 [0.37-0.75]) were each associated with prostate cancer death. On multivariable analysis, PHS46 (HR 2.45 [1.99-2.97]), family history (HR 1.73 [1.48-2.03]), alcohol (HR 1.45 [1.19-1.76]), diabetes (HR 0.62 [0.42-0.90]) all remained associated with fatal disease. Including PHS46 or PHS166 improved multivariable models for fatal prostate cancer (p < 10-15).

The effect of LHRH-antagonist on body composition has never been explored. We evaluated changes in fat (FBM) and lean body mass (LBM) in PCa patients undergoing Degarelix.  Methods:   This is a single-center prospective study, enrolling 29 non-metastatic PCa patients eligible to LHRH-antagonist from 2017 to 2019. All patients received monthly subcutaneous injection of Degarelix for 12 months. Changes in FBM and LBM between baseline and 12-month Degarelix, as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, were the co-primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints were changes in serum lipids, glucose profile and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Appendicular lean mass index (ALMI) and ALMI/FBM ratio were assessed as post-hoc analyses. Linear mixed models with random intercept tested for estimated least squared means differences (EMD).  Results:   FBM significantly increased after 12 months (EMD +2920.7, +13.8%, p < 0.001), whereas LBM remained stable (EMD -187.1, -0.3%, p = 0.8). No differences occurred in lipid profile. Glycated hemoglobin significantly increased and serum FSH significantly decreased. A significant inverse relationship was found between serum FSH and ALMI/FBM ratio after 12 month (r = -0.44, p = 0.02).  Conclusions:   The BLADE study prospectively evaluated changes in body composition after LHRH-antagonist. LHRH-antagonist therapy is associated to an increased risk of obesity and diabetes, but lean body mass and serum lipids are not affected. This may represent an additional evidence supporting the reduced cardiovascular risk associated with LHRH-antagonist.

The detection efficiency of clinically significant prostate cancer (CSPCa) was assessed according to age, digital rectal examination (DRE), prostate volume (PV) on bpMRI, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and PSA density (PSAD). The definition of CSPCa for Gleason score > 6. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis were used to identify predictive factors of absent CSPCa on PBs. Moreover, absent CSPCa contained clinically insignificant prostate cancer (CIPCa) and benign result. The detection rates of present prostate cancer (PCa) and CSPCa were 27.11% and 16.44%, respectively. Patients who were diagnosed as CSPCa had an older age (P < 0.001), suspicious DRE (P < 0.001), a smaller PV (P < 0.001), higher PSA value (P = 0.008) and higher PSAD (P < 0.001) compared to the CIPCa group and benign result group. PSAD < 0.15 ng/ml/cm3 (P = 0.004) and suspicious DRE (P < 0.001) were independent predictors of absent CSPCa on BPs. The negative forecast value of bpMRI for BP detection of CSPCa increased with decreasing PSAD, mainly in patients with naive PB (P < 0.001) but not in prior negative PB patients. 25.33% of the men had the combination of negative bpMRI, PSAD < 0.15 ng/ml/cm3 and PB naive, and none had CSPCa on repeat PBs. The incidence of PB was determined, CSPCa was 1.59%, 0% and 16.67% in patients with negative bpMRI and PSAD < 0.15 ng/ml/cm3, patients with negative bpMRI, PSAD < 0.15 ng/ml/cm3 and biopsy naive and patients with negative bpMRI, PSAD < 0.15 ng/ml/cm3 and prior negative PB, separately. We found that a part of patients with negative bpMRI, a younger age, no suspicious DRE and PSAD < 0.15 ng/ml/cm3 may securely avoid PBs.

Initially, cancers are dependent of androgens for growth and survival. First line therapies reduce levels of circulating androgens or target the androgen receptor (AR) directly. Although most patients show durable responses, many patients eventually progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) creating a need for alternative treatment options. The Rac1 signaling pathway has previously been implicated as a driver of cancer initiation and disease progression. We investigated the role of HACE1, the E3 ubiquitin ligase for Rac1, in prostate cancer and found that HACE1 is commonly lost resulting in hyperactive Rac signaling leading to enhanced cellular proliferation, motility and viability. Importantly, we show that a Rac inhibitor can attenuate the growth and survival of prostate cancer cells. Rac signaling was also found to be critical in prostate cancers that express the AR. Rac inhibition in androgen dependent cells resulted in reduction of AR target gene expression suggesting that targeting Rac1 may be an alternative method for blocking the AR signaling axis. Finally, when used in combination with AR antagonists, Rac inhibition enhanced the suppression of AR target gene expression. Therefore, targeting Rac in prostate cancer has the potential to enhance the efficacy of approved AR therapies.""","""['Erik T Goka', 'Dayrelis T Mesa Lopez', 'Marc E Lippman']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor signaling regulates the transcriptome of prostate cancer cells by modulating global alternative splicing.', 'NDRG2 acts as a negative regulator downstream of androgen receptor and inhibits the growth of androgen-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Angiogenin mediates androgen-stimulated prostate cancer growth and enables castration resistance.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Rac1, A Potential Target for Tumor Therapy.']"""

Registered ultrasound and fluoroscopy (iRUF) can facilitate real-time intraoperative monitoring and plan adaptation, with the aim of attaining superior dosimetric outcomes. The purpose of this research was to compare clinical postimplant dosimetric results of iRUF-guided brachytherapy against brachytherapy using standard ultrasound-guided intraoperative dosimetry methods.  Methods and materials:   We analyzed postimplant dosimetry in 292 patients treated with Pd-103 between January 2007 and December 2018. All patients had postimplant dosimetry measured on day 0 to 1 using fused magnetic resonance/computed tomography assessment.

Postimplant dosimetry in iRUF-treated patients was compared with dosimetry from 240 patients treated using standard (real-time ultrasound) intraoperative seed tracking.  Results:   For every parameter measuring dose coverage to the prostate, iRUF patients had significantly higher values, irrespective of adjustment for year of treatment.

However, SPLC risk factors have not been established and the impact of tobacco smoking remains controversial. We examined the risk factors for SPLC across multiple epidemiologic cohorts and evaluated the impact of smoking cessation on reducing SPLC risk.  Methods:   We analyzed data from 7059 participants in the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) diagnosed with an initial primary lung cancer (IPLC) between 1993 and 2017. Cause-specific proportional hazards models estimated SPLC risk. We conducted validation studies using the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (N = 3423 IPLC cases) and European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (N = 4731 IPLC cases) cohorts and pooled the SPLC risk estimates using random effects meta-analysis.  Results:   Overall, 163 MEC cases (2.3%) developed SPLC. Smoking pack-years (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.18 per 10 pack-years, p < 0.001) and smoking intensity (HR = 1.30 per 10 cigarettes per day, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with increased SPLC risk. Individuals who met the 2013 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force's screening criteria at IPLC diagnosis also had an increased SPLC risk (HR = 1.92; p < 0.001). Validation studies with the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial and European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition revealed consistent results. Meta-analysis yielded pooled HRs of 1.16 per 10 pack-years (pmeta < 0.001), 1.25 per 10 cigarettes per day (pmeta < 0.001), and 1.99 (pmeta < 0.001) for meeting the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force's criteria. In MEC, smoking cessation after IPLC diagnosis was associated with an 83% reduction in SPLC risk (HR = 0.17; p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Tobacco smoking is a risk factor for SPLC.

Long non-coding RNA activated by DNA damage (NORAD) has been observed to have an abnormal expression in various cancers. This article aimed to explore the molecular mechanism underlying the regulatory role of NORAD in bone metastasis of PCa.  Methods:   NORAD expression in clinical PCa tissues and cell lines was detected with the application of qRT-PCR. Cancer cells were then transfected with plasmids expressing NORAD, after which Transwell assay and CCK-8 assay were carried out to detect proliferation, migration, and bone metastasis of PCa. NORAD downstream target molecules were screened through bioinformatics analysis, followed by further verification using dual luciferase assay. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) were labeled with PKH67 and interacted with bone marrow stromal cells. The gain- and loss-function method was applied to determine the internalization and secretion of PCa cells-derived EVs under the intervention of downstream target molecules or NORAD.  Results:   PCa tissues and cell lines were observed to have a high expression of NORAD, particularly in tissues with bone metastasis. NORAD knockdown resulted in reduced secretion and internalization of EVs, and suppressed proliferation, migration, and bone metastasis of PCa cells. It was indicated that NORAD interacted with miR-541-3p, leading to the upregulation of PKM2. Forced expression of PKM2 promoted the transfer of PKH67-labeled EVs to bone marrow stromal cells.  Conclusions:   NORAD might serve as a ceRNA of miR-541-3p to promote PKM2 expression, thereby enhancing the development of bone metastasis in PCa by promoting internalization and transfer of EVs of cancer cells, providing an insight into a novel treatment for the disorder.""","""['Chuan-Yi Hu', 'Juan Chen', 'Xin-Hua Qin', 'Pan You', 'Jie Ma', 'Jing Zhang', 'He Zhang', 'Ji-Dong Xu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['Bone mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles containing NORAD promote osteosarcoma by miR-30c-5p.', 'Tumor-derived miR-378a-3p-containing extracellular vesicles promote osteolysis by activating the Dyrk1a/Nfatc1/Angptl2 axis for bone metastasis.', 'Downregulation of miR-141-3p promotes bone metastasis via activating NF-κB signaling in prostate cancer.', 'Extracellular vesicles promote esophageal cancer progression by delivering lncZEB1-AS1 between cells.', 'Communication of prostate cancer cells with bone cells via extracellular vesicle RNA; a potential mechanism of metastasis.', 'Tumor-derived extracellular vesicle nucleic acids as promising diagnostic biomarkers for prostate cancer.', 'Long non-coding RNAs in bone metastasis: progresses and perspectives as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.', 'Animal models of cancer metastasis to the bone.', 'Pan-cancer analysis of aldolase B gene as a novel prognostic biomarker for human cancers.', 'Non-Coding RNAs Derived from Extracellular Vesicles Promote Pre-Metastatic Niche Formation and Tumor Distant Metastasis.']"""

We demonstrated that two viral capsid proteins were not necessary and that a step parallel with virus core movement across the endosomal membrane was required for this inhibition. Altogether, this work clarifies the mechanisms of MRV-induced HIF-1α inhibition and provides biological relevance for using MRV to inhibit the devastating effects of tumor hypoxia.""","""['Luke D Bussiere', 'Cathy L Miller']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Virology""","""['HIF-1α downregulation and apoptosis in hypoxic prostate tumor cells infected with oncolytic mammalian orthoreovirus.', 'Reovirus and the Host Integrated Stress Response: On the Frontlines of the Battle to Survive.', 'In Vivo Live Imaging of Oncolytic Mammalian Orthoreovirus Expressing NanoLuc Luciferase in Tumor Xenograft Mice.', 'Mammalian orthoreovirus infection in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+) breast cancer cells.', 'Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 in human breast and prostate cancer.', 'Prostate Microbiota and Prostate Cancer: A New Trend in Treatment.', 'Impact of Hypoxia over Human Viral Infections and Key Cellular Processes.']"""

Methods:   The data of 10 patients that received radiation therapy to the prostate were analyzed. Three fiducial markers were implanted in the prostate before treatment initiation for everyday verification of the target's position. Daily X ray images (kilovolt/KV films) of the pelvis were acquired for verification and were matched with baseline images produced during treatment preparation using bony structures and fiducials as landmarks. We calculated the mean difference between the two methods and the prostate displacement derived from these measurements.  Results:   A total of 208 KV films were obtained. Our results showed a non-uniform prostate motion, with most of the displacements observed in the caudal direction followed by anterior, posterior, cranial, right and left. The mean target motion in each of the above directions was 3.5 mm, 3.5 mm, 3.3 mm, 3.9 mm, 2 mm and 2.4 mm. Based on the cumulative frequency of the target's displacement, a margin of 8 mm, 7mm, 5 mm, 4 mm, 9 mm and 7 mm in the anterior, posterior, left, right, cranial and caudal direction respectively would account for 95% of prostate's motion, provided that every day KV image guidance is performed.

Methods:   A total of 136 patients were divided into the observation group (n=68) and the control group (n=68). In the observation group, 125I radioactive seed implantation was performed, bicalutamide capsules were taken orally immediately after operation, and leuprorelin was injected from 1 week after operation. In the control group, IHT alone was administered. The level of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA), maximum urine flow rate (Q max ) and international prostate symptom scale (IPSS) score were compared between the two groups before and after treatment. Moreover, the overall survival (OS), tumor-specific survival (TSS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of patients were recorded.  Results:   There were no statistically significant differences in the PSA level, Q max and IPSS score between the two groups before treatment (p>0.05). At 6, 12 and 24 months after treatment, the level of PSA in the observation group was significantly lower than in the control group (p=0.005, p<0.001, p<0.001). At 24 months after treatment, Q max in the observation group was significantly higher than in the control group (p=0.025). At 12 and 24 months after treatment, the IPSS score in the observation group was significantly lower than that in the control group (p=0.013, p=0.002). During the follow-up period, the intermission time of hormonal therapy and PFS time in the observation group were obviously longer than those in control group (p<0.001). In the two groups, OS was 97.1% and 94.1%, TSS was 95.6% and 92.6%, DMFS was 82.4% and 66.2%, and PFS was 72.1% and 51.5%, respectively. It can be seen that OS and TSS had no statistically significant differences between the two groups (p=0.405, p=0.496), while DMFS and PFS in the observation group were remarkably superior to those in the control group (p=0.037, p=0.022).  Conclusions:   125 I seed implantation combined with IHT is safe and effective in the clinical treatment of patients with moderate- and high-risk non-metastatic prostate cancer.

Univariable and multivariable time-to-event analyses were performed to assess biochemical recurrence (BCR), metastasis, cancer-specific mortality (CSM), and overall survival between Black and White men.  Results:   In total, 1662 men were identified with grade group 4 or 5 prostate cancer initially managed by radical prostatectomy. Black men represented 11.3% of the cohort (n = 188). Black men were younger, demonstrated a longer time from diagnosis to surgery, and were at a lower clinical stage (all P < .05).

The development of nanoscale US agents with US imaging and therapeutic functions has attracted increasing attention. In this study, we successfully developed DOX-loaded poly-1,6-hexanedithiol-sodium bicarbonate nanoparticles (DOX@HADT-SS-NaHCO3 NPs) with pH-responsive NaHCO3 and GSH-responsive disulfide linkages. DOX@HADT-SS-NaHCO3 NPs underwent acid-triggered decomposition of NaHCO3 to generate CO2 bubbles and a reduction of disulfide linkages to further promote the release of CO2 and DOX. The potential of DOX@HADT-SS-NaHCO3 NPs for contrast-enhanced US imaging and therapy of prostate cancer was thoroughly evaluated using in vitro agarose gel phantoms and a C4-2 tumor-bearing nude mice model.

However, evidence on dietary pesticide exposure and breast cancer (BC) is lacking for the general population. We aimed to assess the associations between dietary exposure to pesticides and BC risk among postmenopausal women of the NutriNet-Santé cohort.  Methods:   In 2014, participants completed a self-administered semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire distinguishing conventional and organic foods. Exposures to 25 active substances used in EU plant-protection products were estimated using a pesticide-residue database accounting for farming practices, from Chemisches und Veterinäruntersuchungsamt Stuttgart, Germany. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), adapted for data with excess zeros, was used to establish exposure profiles. The four extracted NMF components' quintiles were introduced into Cox models estimating hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI), adjusted for known confounding factors.  Results:   A total of 13 149 postmenopausal women were included in the analysis (169 BC cases, median follow-up = 4.83 years).

However, tumor-induced immune suppression contributes significantly to poor response rates to aOX40 therapy, thus combining aOX40 with other agents that relieve tumor-mediated immune suppression may significantly improve outcomes. Once such target is galectin-3 (Gal-3), which drives tumor-induced immunosuppression by increasing macrophage infiltration and M2 polarization, restricting TCR signaling, and inducing T cell apoptosis. A wide-variety of tumors also upregulate Gal-3, which is associated with poor prognosis. Tumor-bearing (MCA-205 sarcoma, 4T1 mammary carcinoma, TRAMP-C1 prostate adenocarcinoma) mice were treated with a Gal-3 inhibitor (belapectin; GR-MD-02), aOX40, or combination therapy and the extent of tumor growth was determined. The phenotype and function of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes was determined by flow cytometry, multiplex cytokine assay, and multiplex immunohistochemistry. Gal-3 inhibition synergized with aOX40 to promote tumor regression and increase survival. Specifically, aOX40/belapectin therapy significantly improved survival of tumor-bearing mice through a CD8+ T cell-dependent mechanism. Combination aOX40/belapectin therapy enhanced CD8+ T cell density within the tumor and reduced the frequency and proliferation of regulatory Foxp3+CD4+ T cells. Further, aOX40/belapectin therapy significantly reduced monocytic MDSC (M-MDSCs) and MHC-IIhi macrophage populations, both of which displayed reduced arginase 1 and increased iNOS. Combination aOX40/belapectin therapy alleviated M-MDSC-specific functional suppression compared to M-MDSCs isolated from untreated tumors. Our data suggests that Gal-3 inhibition plus aOX40 therapy reduces M-MDSC-meditated immune suppression thereby increasing CD8+ T cell recruitment leading to increased tumor regression and survival.""","""['Elizabeth R Sturgill', 'Annah S Rolig', 'Stefanie N Linch', 'Courtney Mick', 'Melissa J Kasiewicz', 'Zhaoyu Sun', 'Peter G Traber', 'Harold Shlevin', 'William L Redmond']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Oncoimmunology""","""['Enhancing clinical and immunological effects of anti-PD-1 with belapectin, a galectin-3 inhibitor.', 'Combination OX40 agonism/CTLA-4 blockade with HER2 vaccination reverses T-cell anergy and promotes survival in tumor-bearing mice.', 'Role of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells in High-Dose-Irradiated TRAMP-C1 Tumors: A Therapeutic Target and an Index for Assessing Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Galectin-3: an immune checkpoint target for musculoskeletal tumor patients.', 'Galectin-3 as a biomarker in breast neoplasms: Mechanisms and applications in patient care.', 'Dynamic polarization of tumor-associated macrophages and their interaction with intratumoral T cells in an inflamed tumor microenvironment: from mechanistic insights to therapeutic opportunities.', 'Galectin-1: A Traditionally Immunosuppressive Protein Displays Context-Dependent Capacities.', 'Galectins as pivotal components in oncogenesis and immune exclusion in human malignancies.', 'Targeting galectin-driven regulatory circuits in cancer and fibrosis.', 'Inhibition of galectins in cancer: Biological challenges for their clinical application.']"""

Eupatorin, a flavonoid with a wide range of phytomedical activities, suppresses proliferation of and induces apoptosis of multiple cancer cell lines. However, low solubility, poor bioavailability, and rapid degradation limit its efficacy. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether the use of mPEG-b-poly (lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) coated iron oxide nanoparticles as a carrier could enhance the therapeutic efficacy of eupatorin in DU-145 and LNcaP human prostate cancer cell lines. Nanoparticles were prepared by the co-precipitation method and were fully characterized for morphology, surface charge, particle size, drug loading, encapsulation efficiency and in vitro drug-release profile. The inhibitory effect of nanoparticles on cell viability was evaluated by MTT test. Apoptosis was then determined by Hoechest staining, cell cycle analysis, NO production, annexin/propidium iodide (PI) assay, and Western blotting. The results indicated that eupatorin was successfully entrapped in Fe3O4@mPEG-b-PLGA nanoparticles with an efficacy of (90.99 ± 2.1)%. The nanoparticle's size was around (58.5 ± 4) nm with a negative surface charge [(-34.16 ± 1.3) mV]. In vitro release investigation showed a 30% initial burst release of eupatorin in 24 h, followed by sustained release over 200 h. The MTT assay indicated that eupatorin-loaded Fe3O4@mPEG-b-PLGA nanoparticles exhibited a significant decrease in the growth rate of DU-145 and LNcaP cells and their IC50 concentrations were 100 μM and 75 μM, respectively. Next, apoptosis was confirmed by nuclear condensation, enhancement of cell population in the sub-G1 phase and increased NO level. Annexin/PI analysis demonstrated that eupatorin-loaded Fe3O4@mPEG-b-PLGA nanoparticles could increase apoptosis and decrease necrosis frequency. Finally, Western blotting analysis confirmed these results and showed that Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and the cleaved caspase-3 level were up-regulated by the designing nanoparticles. Encapsulation of eupatorin in Fe3O4@mPEG-b-PLGA nanoparticles increased its anticancer effects in prostate cancer cell lines as compared to free eupatorin. Based on these results, this formulation can provide a sustained eupatorin-delivery system for cancer treatment with the drug remaining active at a significantly lower dose, making it a suitable candidate for pharmacological uses.""","""['Marziyeh Shalchi Tousi', 'Houri Sepehri', 'Sepideh Khoee', 'Mahdi Moridi Farimani', 'Ladan Delphi', 'Fariba Mansourizadeh']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Pharm Anal""","""['Anticancer activity of cisplatin-loaded PLGA-mPEG nanoparticles on LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Paclitaxel/methotrexate co-loaded PLGA nanoparticles in glioblastoma treatment: Formulation development and in vitro antitumor activity evaluation.', 'Preparation, in vitro and in vivo evaluation of mPEG-PLGA nanoparticles co-loaded with syringopicroside and hydroxytyrosol.', 'Development of bicalutamide-loaded PLGA nanoparticles: preparation, characterization and in-vitro evaluation for the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Synthesis, purification, and anticancer effect of magnetic Fe3O4-loaded poly (lactic-co-glycolic) nanoparticles of the natural drug tetrandrine.', 'Current advances in nanoformulations of therapeutic agents targeting tumor microenvironment to overcome drug resistance.', 'Metal Nanoparticle-Flavonoid Connections: Synthesis, Physicochemical and Biological Properties, as Well as Potential Applications in Medicine.', 'Reports of Plant-Derived Nanoparticles for Prostate Cancer Therapy.', 'Bioinspired Synthesis of Magnetic Nanoparticles Based on Iron Oxides Using Orange Waste and Their Application as Photo-Activated Antibacterial Agents.', 'One-Step Preparation of Highly Stable Copper-Zinc Ferrite Nanoparticles in Water Suitable for MRI Thermometry.']"""

Therefore, we evaluated the impact of the severe economic recession in Finland from 1991-1994 on the incidence of all cancers and cancer subtypes among a middle-age and older population.  Methods:   From the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study (KIHD), a population-based sample of 1,620 women and men aged 53-73 years were examined from 1998-2001. The cancer-free participants completed a questionnaire on the possible impact of the 1990s recession in Finland on their lives. Incident cases of cancer were obtained through record linkage with the Finnish Cancer Registry. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) of incident cancer events after adjusting for possible confounders.  Results:   A total of 1,096 cancer-free participants had experienced socioeconomic hardships due to the recession at the baseline. During 20 years of follow-up, 473 participants developed cancer. After adjustment for age, baseline socioeconomic position, and lifestyle factors, the risk of all cancers was 32% higher among men who experienced socioeconomic hardships compared to those who did not (HR 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-1.74, P = 0.05). Prostate-genital cancer was 71% higher among men with hardships (n = 103, HR 1.71; 95% CI, 1.06-2.74, P = 0.02). No association was observed between socioeconomic hardships and subsequent risk of total or any subtype of cancer among women.

A majority of cancer patients prefer home death to hospital death. At the same time, the actual location of death is often against patient's last-known wish. The aim of this study was to analyze whether socioeconomic factors influence if Swedish palliative cancer patients die at home or at a hospital. There is no previous study on location of death encompassing several years in Swedish cancer patients.  Methods:   Data was collected from the Swedish Register of Palliative Care for patients diagnosed with brain tumor, lung, colorectal, prostate or breast cancer recorded between 2011 and 2014. The data was linked to the Swedish Cancer Register, the Cause of Death Register and the Longitudinal Integration Database for health-insurance and labor-market studies. A total of 8990 patients were included.  Results:   We found that marital status was the factor that seemed to affect the place of death. Lack of a partner, compared to being married, was associated with a higher likelihood of dying at a hospital.  Conclusion:   Our findings are in line with similar earlier studies encompassing only 1 year and based on patients in other countries. Whether inequalities at least partly explain the differences remains to be investigated. Patients dying of cancer in Sweden, who do not have a life partner, may not have the option of dying at home due to lack of informal support.

We previously discovered that ATM, a protein kinase deficient in Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) disease, is an insulin-responsive protein that participates in insulin-mediated glucose uptake in muscle cells by stimulating glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation. However, the role of ATM in glucose uptake and tumorigenesis of cancer cells is unclear. In the present study, we found that aggressive breast and prostate cancer cell lines with overactivated Akt activity exhibit enhanced glucose uptake and GLUT1 translocation upon insulin treatment, and KU-55933, a specific inhibitor of ATM, inhibits insulin-mediated glucose uptake by blocking translocation of GLUT1 to the cell surface. KU-55933 also inhibits aerobic glycolysis and ATP production in these cells. Moreover, KU-55933 induces apoptosis and inhibits motility of cancer cells by inhibiting glucose uptake. Our results showed that while high concentration of glucose and insulin promote the expression of a mesenchymal biomarker (vimentin) in these cancer cells, KU-55933 strongly inhibits its expression as well as epithelial to mesenchymal transition. The roles of ATM in stimulating glucose uptake, glycolysis, motility, and proliferation of cancer cells were demonstrated by knocking-down ATM in these cells. KU-55933 treatment also inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in vivo in mouse mammary tumors through inhibition of GLUT1 translocation and vimentin expression. These results suggest that ATM acts as a promoter of tumorigenesis in cancer cells with overactivated Akt, and KU-55933 induces apoptosis and inhibits motility by blocking GLUT1-mediated glucose uptake and glycolysis in these cancer cells, which may lead to the use of KU-55933 and its analogs as new preventive or therapeutic agents against cancer.""","""['Benjamin R E Harris', 'Ye Zhang', 'Jianxin Tao', 'Renhui Shen', 'Xiaoqian Zhao', 'Margot P Cleary', 'Tong Wang', 'Da-Qing Yang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""FASEB J""","""['The ATM inhibitor KU-55933 suppresses cell proliferation and induces apoptosis by blocking Akt in cancer cells with overactivated Akt.', 'Improved ATM kinase inhibitor KU-60019 radiosensitizes glioma cells, compromises insulin, AKT and ERK prosurvival signaling, and inhibits migration and invasion.', 'Oxidized ATM-mediated glycolysis enhancement in breast cancer-associated fibroblasts contributes to tumor invasion through lactate as metabolic coupling.', 'Metabolic phenotype of bladder cancer.', 'Glucose transporter 1 in rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmunity.', 'Characterization of Lipid Alterations by Oncogenic PIK3CA Mutations Using Untargeted Lipidomics in Breast Cancer.', 'A necroptosis gene signature predicts prostate cancer recurrence, and is linked to somatic mutation, therapeutic landscape, and immune infiltration.', 'A Triphenylphosphonium-Functionalized Delivery System for an ATM Kinase Inhibitor That Ameliorates Doxorubicin Resistance in Breast Carcinoma Mammospheres.', 'Overview of Cancer Metabolism and Signaling Transduction.', 'Glucose transporters: Important regulators of endometrial cancer therapy sensitivity.']"""

We developed a software program that semi-automatically calculated the bone scan index (BSI) on technetium-99m hydroxymethylene diphosphonate bone scintigraphy scans with a computer-aided diagnosis system (CAD) and examined whether the BSI calculated using this software could replace the extent of disease (EOD) score.  Methods:   The subjects were 175 patients who were diagnosed with prostate cancer at our hospital and underwent bone scintigraphy. We analyzed receiver operating characteristic curves to determine the BSI cutoff value between EOD groups. The cutoff value was determined based on the maximum value of the sum of the sensitivity and specificity.  Results:   BSI cutoff values of 0.20, 1.56, and 4.56 were used to distinguish between EOD 0 and 1-4 (sensitivity [87.2%] and specificity [100.0%]), between EOD 0- and 2-4 (sensitivity [85.2%] and specificity [92.0%]), and between EOD 0-2 and 3-4 (sensitivity [88.4%] and specificity [99.2%]), respectively.  Conclusion:   Our results suggest that this software can calculate BSI, and the software may play a role in predicting prognosis and selecting an appropriate treatment strategy.

However, some patients received docetaxel or the prior alternative androgen-signalling-targeted inhibitor in the metastatic hormone-sensitive (mHSPC) setting. Therefore, the CARD results cannot be directly translated to a Japanese population.  Methods:   Patients (N = 255) received cabazitaxel (25 mg/m2 IV Q3W, prednisone, G-CSF) versus abiraterone (1000 mg PO, prednisone) or enzalutamide (160 mg PO) after prior docetaxel and progression ≤12 months on the alternative androgen-signalling-targeted inhibitor.

Results:   A total of 222 patients (median age 70 years) were included in this subanalysis.

Therefore, effective drugs against both CRPC and NEPC are needed. We have previously described a dual role of mast cells (MCs) in prostate cancer, being capable to promote adenocarcinoma but also to restrain NEPC. This finding suggests that a molecule targeting both MCs and NEPC cells could be effective against prostate cancer. Using an in silico drug repurposing approach, here we identify the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam as a potential candidate for this purpose. We found that the protein target of levetiracetam, SV2A, is highly expressed by both NEPC cells and MCs infiltrating prostate adenocarcinoma, while it is low or negligible in adenocarcinoma cells. In vitro, levetiracetam inhibited the proliferation of NEPC cells and the degranulation of MCs. In mice bearing subcutaneous tumors levetiracetam was partially active on both NEPC and adenocarcinoma, the latter effect due to the inhibition of MMP9 release by MCs. Notably, in TRansgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) mice subjected to surgical castration to mimic androgen deprivation therapy, levetiracetam reduced onset and frequency of both high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, adenocarcinoma and NEPC, thus increasing the number of cured mice showing only signs of tumor regression. Our results demonstrate that levetiracetam can directly restrain NEPC development after androgen deprivation, and that it can also block adenocarcinoma progression through the inhibition of some MCs functions. These findings open the possibility of further testing levetiracetam for the therapy of prostate cancer or of MC-mediated diseases.""","""['Roberta Sulsenti', 'Barbara Frossi', 'Lucia Bongiovanni', 'Valeria Cancila', 'Paola Ostano', 'Irene Fischetti', 'Claudia Enriquez', 'Francesca Guana', 'Giovanna Chiorino', 'Claudio Tripodo', 'Carlo E Pucillo', 'Mario P Colombo', 'Elena Jachetti']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Front Immunol""","""['Mast cell targeting hampers prostate adenocarcinoma development but promotes the occurrence of highly malignant neuroendocrine cancers.', 'Icaritin suppresses development of neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer through inhibition of IL-6/STAT3 and Aurora kinase A pathways in TRAMP mice.', 'Histone demethylase PHF8 drives neuroendocrine prostate cancer progression by epigenetically upregulating FOXA2.', 'Systems Medicine Approaches to Improving Understanding, Treatment, and Clinical Management of Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'Molecular model for neuroendocrine prostate cancer progression.', 'Use of Antiepileptic Drugs and Risk of Prostate Cancer: A Nationwide Case-Control Study in Prostate Cancer Data Base Sweden.', 'Pharmacological Efficacy of Repurposing Drugs in the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Reprogramming landscape highlighted by dynamic transcriptomes in therapy-induced neuroendocrine differentiation.', 'Therapeutic targets and signaling pathways of active components of QiLing decoction against castration-resistant prostate cancer based on network pharmacology.']"""

An impediment to identifying novel pharmacotherapies is the incomplete understanding of paracrine signalling. Oxytocin has been highlighted as a potential paracrine mediator of BPH. To better understand oxytocin signalling, we investigated the effects of exogenous oxytocin on both stromal cell proliferation, and inherent spontaneous prostate contractions using primary models derived from human prostate tissue. We show that the Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR) is widely expressed in the human prostate, and co-localises to contractile cells within the prostate stroma. Exogenous oxytocin did not modulate prostatic fibroblast proliferation, but did significantly (p < 0.05) upregulate the frequency of spontaneous contractions in prostate tissue, indicating a role in generating smooth muscle tone. Application of atosiban, an OXTR antagonist, significantly (p < 0.05) reduced spontaneous contractions. Individual tissue responsiveness to both exogenous oxytocin (R2 = 0.697, p < 0.01) and atosiban (R2 = 0.472, p < 0.05) was greater in tissue collected from older men.

Methods:   Men with stage III or IV prostate cancer (N = 192) who had undergone ADT within the last year were randomized to CBSM or health promotion.

However, these markers generally demonstrated a rebound increase from 6 to 12 months (β = 1.91-4.06, p's = 0.06-<0.001). Men in health promotion also demonstrated a flatter diurnal cortisol slope versus men in CBSM at 6 months (β = -2.27, p = .023), but not at 12 months. There were no intervention effects on CRP, IL-6, or overall cortisol output.  Conclusions:   Contrary to hypotheses, CBSM did not lead to changes in the circulating inflammatory markers and cortisol relative to health promotion. CBSM may be associated with healthy diurnal cortisol rhythm because of its focus on cognitive behavioral approaches to stress management. More research is needed to understand the impact of CBSM and health promotion on biomarkers among men with advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Frank J Penedo', 'Rina S Fox', 'Emily A Walsh', 'Betina Yanez', 'Gregory E Miller', 'Laura B Oswald', 'Ryne Estabrook', 'Robert T Chatterton', 'David C Mohr', 'Mark J Begale', 'Sarah C Flury', 'Kent Perry', 'Shilajit D Kundu', 'Patricia I Moreno']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Brain Behav Immun""","""['Stress management reduces intraindividual cortisol variability, while not impacting other measures of cortisol rhythm, in a group of women at risk for breast cancer.', 'The SMART Moms Program: A Randomized Trial of the Impact of Stress Management on Perceived Stress and Cortisol in Low-Income Pregnant Women.', 'Study design and protocol for a culturally adapted cognitive behavioral stress and self-management intervention for localized prostate cancer: The Encuentros de Salud study.', 'Early versus deferred androgen suppression in the treatment of advanced prostatic cancer.', 'Diurnal cortisol slopes and mental and physical health outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Comorbidity burden and health-related quality of life in men with advanced prostate cancer.', 'Implication of cognitive-behavioral stress management on anxiety, depression, and quality of life in acute myocardial infarction patients after percutaneous coronary intervention: a multicenter, randomized, controlled study.', 'The influence of lifestyle changes (diet, exercise and stress reduction) on prostate cancer tumour biology and patient outcomes: A systematic review.', 'Effect of cognitive behavioral stress management on anxiety, depression, and quality of life in colorectal cancer patients post tumor resection: a randomized, controlled study.', 'Comorbidity burden and health-related quality of life in men with advanced prostate cancer.']"""

Objective:   To examine tumor size as an independent predictor of muscle-invasive and/or non-organ-confined rates of RPUC at RNU.  Design, setting, and participants:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database (2004-2016), we identified nonmetastatic RPUC at RNU.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   First, we examined stage and grade distributions. Second, two separate univariable and subsequent multivariable logistic regression models (LRMs) were fitted to test the association between tumor size and the rate of (1) muscle-invasive or higher (pT2-4N0-2) and (2) non-organ-confined (pT3-4N0-2) RPUC at RNU.  Results and limitations:   Of 4657 patients, 3052 (65.5%) had pT2-4N0-2 and 2382 (51.2%) pT3-4N0-2 RPUC at RNU. The median tumor size was 3.7 cm (interquartile range 2.5-5.0). The high-grade RPUC rate ranged from 71.1% to 87.2% (p < 0.001) among SEER registries. Conversely, no differences were recorded for stage (p > 0.05) or tumor size (p = 0.1) across all registries. Rates of pT2-4N0-2 and pT3-4N0-2 RPUC increased with tumor size. Specifically, for tumor size intervals from 0.1-1.0 cm to 9.1-10.0 cm, the pT2-4N0-2 rate ranged from 45% to 83% and the pT3-4N0-2 rate ranged from 23% to 75%, respectively (both p < 0.001). In multivariable LRMs, tumor size (in 1-cm units) was an independent predictor of pT2-4N0-2 (odds ratio [OR] 1.25; p < 0.001) and pT3-4N0-2 (OR 1.30; p < 0.001) disease at RNU.  Conclusions:   Tumor size is a key predictor of muscle-invasive or non-organ-confined RPUC. Greater tumor size directly and virtually linearly predicts a higher rate of invasive or non-organ-confined RPUC at RNU.  Patient summary:   For patients with cancer in urinary tract cells lining the kidney, larger tumor size predicts worse stage of the disease at surgery.""","""['Claudia Collà Ruvolo', 'Luigi Nocera', 'L Franziska Stolzenbach', 'Mike Wenzel', 'Gianluigi Califano', 'Zhe Tian', 'Paolo Verze', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Fred Saad', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Vincenzo Mirone', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Oncological Outcomes of Laparoscopic Nephroureterectomy Versus Open Radical Nephroureterectomy for Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma: An European Association of Urology Guidelines Systematic Review.', 'Oncologic Outcomes of Kidney-sparing Surgery Versus Radical Nephroureterectomy for Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma: A Systematic Review by the EAU Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer Guidelines Panel.', 'Urothelial Carcinoma of the Renal Pelvis and Ureter: Does Location Make a Difference?', 'Novel Classification for Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma to Better Risk-stratify Patients Eligible for Kidney-sparing Strategies: An International Collaborative Study.', 'Accuracy and Clinical Utility of a Tumor Grade- and Stage-based Predictive Model in Localized Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma.', 'Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma: A Rare Malignancy with Distinct Immuno-Genomic Features in the Era of Precision-Based Therapies.', 'Efficacy of combined organ-sparing management of invasive upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma.', 'Segmental ureterectomy for high-risk ureteral carcinoma: a preliminary report.', 'Diagnostic performance of an immunoassay based on urine exfoliated cell enrichment nanotechnology for upper tract urothelial carcinoma: a retrospective, monocentric study.', 'Inadvertent radical nephrectomy leads to worse prognosis in renal pelvic urothelial carcinoma patients: A propensity score-matched study.']"""

Secondary aim was to identify whether the number of cores influenced the occurrence of complications.  Patients and methods:   A cohort of 184 patients undergoing perineal prostate biopsy without antibiotic prophylaxis from 2015 to 2017 was analyzed retrospectively. On average, 41 cores were taken via two perineal skin punctures. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from patients´ electronic medical records. Binary logistic regression was performed to identify predictors for complications with the following covariates: age, prostate specific antigen (PSA), prostate volume, Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System score, history of prostatitis, therapeutic anticoagulation, risk factors for urinary tract infection, surgery duration, and the number of biopsy cores. Furthermore, we calculated chi-squared tests with post hoc analyses for differences in the occurrence of complications between quartiles of the above-mentioned parameters.  Results:   The overall complication rate was 10.8% (20/185). Out of 20, 19 (95 %) complications were ≤ grade 2 according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. There were two cases of afebrile urinary tract infection, and no patient developed fever or sepsis. Acute urinary retention was reported in 10 patients (5.4 %). The total number of cores was not associated to infectious complications or acute urinary retention rates.

The purpose of this study was to quantify the strength of patient preferences for delaying prostate cancer progression utilizing a discrete choice experiment (DCE) and valuing 3 health states in the continuum of CRPC.  Patients and methods:   Men with CRPC, recruited from US patient panels, completed a cross-sectional web-based survey. The survey consisted of vignette-based time trade-off and a DCE designed to quantify patients' willingness to pay to delay metastatic CRPC. Three health states were presented: (1) living with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) (2) living with metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) before chemotherapy, and (3) living with mCRPC either on or after chemotherapy. The DCE consisted of 15 hypothetical choices with attributes characterizing CRPC (pain, fatigue, out of pocket cost, dosing, and time until cancer metastasizes). Patients' willingness to pay for changes in each attribute were derived.  Results:   A total of 176 patients with CRPC were surveyed (mean age: 64.2 years; 74% nmCRPC). Patients valued the nmCRPC health state (0.865) significantly higher than mCRPC before chemotherapy (0.743) or mCRPC on or after chemotherapy (0.476), both P < 0.001. In the DCE, patient treatment valuation was most affected by increasing the number of months until cancer metastasized; patients were willing to pay an additional $682 per month to delay time to metastases from 6 to 24 months (95% Confidence Interval: $387-$977) and additional $1,041 per month to delay time to metastasis to 48 months (95% Confidence Interval: $591-$1,490).

Despite recent pan-cancer approval of ICB treatment for any TMB-H tumor, as assessed by the targeted FoundationOne CDx assay in nine tumor types, the utility of this biomarker has not been fully demonstrated across all cancers.  Patients and methods:   Data from over 10 000 patient tumors included in The Cancer Genome Atlas were used to compare approaches to determine TMB and identify the correlation between predicted neoantigen load and CD8 T cells. Association of TMB with ICB treatment outcomes was analyzed by both objective response rates (ORRs, N = 1551) and overall survival (OS, N = 1936).  Results:   In cancer types where CD8 T-cell levels positively correlated with neoantigen load, such as melanoma, lung, and bladder cancers, TMB-H tumors exhibited a 39.8% ORR to ICB [95% confidence interval (CI) 34.9-44.8], which was significantly higher than that observed in low TMB (TMB-L) tumors [odds ratio (OR) = 4.1, 95% CI 2.9-5.8, P < 2 × 10-16]. In cancer types that showed no relationship between CD8 T-cell levels and neoantigen load, such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, and glioma, TMB-H tumors failed to achieve a 20% ORR (ORR = 15.3%, 95% CI 9.2-23.4, P = 0.95), and exhibited a significantly lower ORR relative to TMB-L tumors (OR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.24-0.88, P = 0.02). Bulk ORRs were not significantly different between the two categories of tumors (P = 0.10) for patient cohorts assessed.

An anti-tumor effect of CGs in breast and prostate cancers has been reported, but the effect of CGs on ovarian cancer is still unclear.  Aims:   In this study, the effects of CGs on proliferation, cytotoxicity and cell cycle of ovarian cancer cell line (SKOV-3) have been investigated.  Procedure:   The cell proliferation and cytotoxicity were detected by MTT assay and LDH activity assay, respectively. CGs, at concentrations higher than IC50, decreased cell proliferation and showed increased cytotoxicity toward SKOV-3 cells. The colony-formation ability was reduced after treatment with digoxin and digitoxin for 10 days. Furthermore, we explored the effect of digoxin and digitoxin on the distribution of cell cycle by flow cytometry.  Results:   Results revealed that both digoxin and digitoxin led to cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase with 24 or 48 hours, but the arrest of G0/G1 phase was not observed at 72 hours. We evaluated the percentage of hypodiploid cell population as an index of the cellular fragments through flow cytometry. The data indicated that cellular fragments were significantly increased by treating with digitoxin at the concentrations of IC50 and 10-6 M for 72 hours.  Conclusion:   Taken together, these data suggest that CGs decreased cell proliferation and increased cytotoxicity through cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase. CGs have anti-tumor effect in SKOV-3 cells and might be a potential therapeutic drug for ovarian cancer. Since this study is a preliminary investigation of CGs on SKOV-3 cells, more experiments might be performed in the future. Furthermore, more ovarian cancer cell lines might also be employed in the future studies to confirm the effect of CGs in ovarian cancer.""","""['Jou-Chun Chou', 'Jie-Hau Li', 'Chih-Chieh Chen', 'Chien-Wei Chen', 'Ho Lin', 'Paulus S Wang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Integr Cancer Ther""","""['Interaction of Odoroside A, A Known Natural Cardiac Glycoside, with Na+/K+-ATPase.', 'Studies on cardioactive steroids.

We assessed efficacy, tolerance, and adverse events related with the use of remifentanil TCI during various procedures.  Design:   Prospective, observational.  Setting:   Two teaching hospitals.  Patients:   We enrolled 434 patients undergoing procedures suitable for conscious sedation.  Interventions:   The following procedures considered suitable were included: interventional radiology, gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy, interventional cardiology, and peripheral dermatology. Sedation options were determined during the preoperative anesthesia assessment.  Main outcome measures:   Demographics were recorded as well as success rate, remifentanil dosage, pain scores, respiratory or cardiovascular events, and patient and operator satisfaction.  Results:   The procedure was successful in 429 patients (99 percent), canceled in four patients because of agitation, apnea, desaturation, and converted to general anesthesia in two for major pain. The maximal remifentanil target was around 2-3 ng/ml for most procedures, but it was 3-5 ng/ml for GI endoscopy and urology. A total of 172 patients (40 percent) had bradypnea < 8 min-1, but only 26 (6 percent) had hypoxemia < 90 percent. Eighteen patients (4 percent) required mandibular luxation, and twelve needed face mask ventilation. There were no major cardiovascular adverse events.  Conclusions:   Remifentanil TCI is a suitable protocol for procedural sedation, but respiratory depression is a permanent concern. This risk requires equipped environment and competent medical personnel on hand to adjust the target before hypoxemia occurs.

Margin status only had a minor impact on the predictive ability for sRT (area under the curve (AUC): p < .001) and no significant impact for subsequent ADT (AUC: p = 1). Significant inter-institutional difference in the association between PSM with sRT or ADT was observed.

Methods:   The medical charts of patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer treated with intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guérin between 2000 and 2018 at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were stratified into three groups (intermediate-, high- and highest-risk groups) according to the risk classification of the updated Japanese Urological Association guidelines 2019.

Our aim was to determine, at messenger RNA (mRNA) level, the performance of the genes in the commercial panels Decipher, Oncotype DX, Prolaris, and mutational panel MSK-IMPACT to predict metastasis-free and prostate cancer-specific death (PCSD) in patients with GG 2-4 prostate cancer at radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   The retrospective cohort consisted of GG 2-4 patients treated with radical prostatectomy (median follow-up 10.4 years). Seventy-six cases with postoperative metastasis or PCSD and 84 controls with similar clinical baseline risk, but without progression, were analyzed. Index lesion mRNA transcripts were analyzed using NanoString technology. Random forest models were trained using panel gene sets to predict clinical endpoints and area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, Youden index, and number needed to diagnose (NND) was measured. Survival probability was assessed with Kaplan-Meier estimator.  Results:   All gene sets outperformed clinical parameters and predicted metastasis-free and prostate cancer-specific survival. However, there were significant differences between the panels. In metastasis prediction, the genes in Oncotype DX had inferior performance (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.65) compared to other panels (AUC = 0.73-0.74). Decipher, MSK-IMPACT and Prolaris showed similar NND (2.83-3.12) with Oncotype DX having highest NND (4.79). In PCSD prediction, the Prolaris gene set performed worse (AUC = 0.66) than MSK-IMPACT or Decipher (AUC = 0.72). Oncotype DX performed similarly to other panels (AUC = 0.69, p > .05). Oncotype DX demonstrated lowest NND (2.79) compared to other panels (4.22-5.66).  Conclusion:   Transcript analysis of genes included in commercial panels is feasible in survival prediction of GG 2-4 patients after radical prostatectomy and may aid in clinical decision making. There were significant differences between the panels, and overall stronger predictive gene sets are needed.

The aim of this work is to investigate the use of an additional composite difference metric (CDM) for earlier detection of errors.  Methods:   Portal images were predicted for the volumetric modulated arc therapy plans of six prostate patients. Errors in monitor units, aperture opening, aperture position and path length were deliberately introduced into all 180 segments of the treatment plans, and these plans were delivered to a water-equivalent phantom. Four different metrics, consisting of central axis signal, mean image value and two image difference measures, were used to identify errors, and a CDM was added, consisting of a weighted power sum of the individual metrics. To optimise the weights of the CDM and to evaluate the resulting timeliness of error detection, a leave-pair-out strategy was used. For each combination of four patients, the weights of the CDM were determined by an exhaustive search, and the result was evaluated on the remaining two patients.  Results:   The median segment index at which the errors were identified was 87 (range 40-130) when using all of the individual metrics separately. Using a CDM as well as multiple separate metrics reduced this to 73 (35-95). The median weighting factors of the four metrics constituting the composite were (0.15, 0.10, 0.15, 0.00). Due to selection of suitable threshold levels, there was only one false positive result in the six patients.  Conclusion:   This study shows that, in conjunction with appropriate error thresholds, use of a CDM is able to identify increased image differences around 20% earlier than the separate measures.

Previous risk models have had moderate success with the area under the curve (AUC) ranging from 0.68 to 0.77. Here we demonstrate a population-based machine learning model for endometrial cancer screening that achieves a testing AUC of 0.96. We train seven machine learning algorithms based solely on personal health data, without any genomic, imaging, biomarkers, or invasive procedures. The data come from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO). We further compare our machine learning model with 15 gynecologic oncologists and primary care physicians in the stratification of endometrial cancer risk for 100 women. We find a random forest model that achieves a testing AUC of 0.96 and a neural network model that achieves a testing AUC of 0.91. We test both models in risk stratification against 15 practicing physicians. Our random forest model is 2.5 times better at identifying above-average risk women with a 2-fold reduction in the false positive rate. Our neural network model is 2 times better at identifying above-average risk women with a 3-fold reduction in the false positive rate. Our machine learning models provide a non-invasive and cost-effective way to identify high-risk sub-populations who may benefit from early screening of endometrial cancer, prior to disease onset.

Publicly available data on expression of genes, miRs and disease-free survival of patients with prostate cancer were analyzed along with RNAseq of transfected cell lines. miR-769-5p expression was inversely associated with patient survival and in vitro assays indicated that its inhibition reduced the proliferation and increased apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. miR-769-5p was revealed to target Rho GTPase activating protein 10 (ARHGAP10) and increased expression of ARHGAP10 in tumors was determined to be associated with a favorable prognosis regarding disease-free survival. Of note, ARHGAP10 is a purported tumor suppressor in ovarian cancer, where it inhibits cell division cycle 42 (CDC42) activity and increases apoptosis. Similar effects were observed in prostate cancer cells, where miR-769-5p inhibition increased ARHGAP10 and led to reduced CDC42 activity. Furthermore, miR-769-5p inhibition increased apoptosis, which was partly reversed by additional knockdown of ARHGAP10.

To explore their bioactivity, we assessed the antioxidant, enzyme inhibitory abilities of the dichloromethane (DCM), ethyl acetate, methanol, and water extracts prepared from the leaves and bark. The cytotoxicity and anticancer properties of the extracts were also assessed in vitro. The water extract of C. decapeleta leaves possessed highest phenolic content (108.16 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g extract), while the highest flavonoid content was recorded for the C. bonduc leaf methanolic extract (27.89 mg rutin equivalent (RE)/g extract). In general, C. decapeleta extracts possessed higher radical scavenging potential compared to C. bonduc extracts.

The cytotoxicity of the most potent methanolic and aqueous extracts were assessed against four cell lines. The chemical profiles of both species appeared to be different. C. bonduc was abundant in organic and phenolic acids as well as their esters. Flavonoid glycosides, bonducellin and its derivatives and caesalminaxins were identified. Whereas, C. decalpetala possessed many galloylated compounds. The cytotoxicity of C. bonduc and C. decapetala extracts was tested using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) based assay on VERO (kidney of an adult African Green monkey cells), HeLa (human cervical adenocarcinoma cells), RKO (human colon carcinoma cells), FaDu (human hypopharyngeal squamous carcinoma cells) cell lines.

The gold standard for the diagnosis of prostate cancer is a pathologists' evaluation of prostate tissue. To potentially assist pathologists deep / learning / based cancer detection systems have been developed. Many of the state-of-the-art models are patch / based convolutional neural networks, as the use of entire scanned slides is hampered by memory limitations on accelerator cards. Patch-based systems typically require detailed, pixel-level annotations for effective training. However, such annotations are seldom readily available, in contrast to the clinical reports of pathologists, which contain slide-level labels. As such, developing algorithms which do not require manual pixel-wise annotations, but can learn using only the clinical report would be a significant advancement for the field. In this paper, we propose to use a streaming implementation of convolutional layers, to train a modern CNN (ResNet / 34) with 21 million parameters end-to-end on 4712 prostate biopsies. The method enables the use of entire biopsy images at high-resolution directly by reducing the GPU memory requirements by 2.4 TB. We show that modern CNNs, trained using our streaming approach, can extract meaningful features from high-resolution images without additional heuristics, reaching similar performance as state-of-the-art patch-based and multiple-instance learning methods. By circumventing the need for manual annotations, this approach can function as a blueprint for other tasks in histopathological diagnosis.

We re-evaluated this classification in a database from a large international consortium.  Materials and methods:   Data on 2,451 men with metastatic seminoma treated with cisplatin- and etoposide-based first-line chemotherapy between 1990 and 2013 were collected from 30 institutions or collaborative groups in Australia, Europe, and North America. Clinical trial and registry data were included. Primary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) calculated from day 1 of treatment. Variables at initial presentation were evaluated for their prognostic impact. Results were validated in an independent validation set of 764 additional patients.  Results:   Compared with the initial IGCCCG classification, in our modern series, 5-year PFS improved from 82% to 89% (95% CI, 87 to 90) and 5-year OS from 86% to 95% (95% CI, 94 to 96) in good prognosis, and from 67% to 79% (95% CI, 70 to 85) and 72% to 88% (95% CI, 80 to 93) in intermediate prognosis patients. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) proved to be an additional adverse prognostic factor. Good prognosis patients with LDH above 2.5× upper limit of normal had a 3-year PFS of 80% (95% CI, 75 to 84) and a 3-year OS of 92% (95% CI, 88 to 95) versus 92% (95% CI, 90 to 94) and 97% (95% CI, 96 to 98) in the group with lower LDH.  Conclusion:   PFS and OS in metastatic seminoma significantly improved in our modern series compared with the original data. The original IGCCCG classification retains its relevance, but can be further refined by adding LDH at a cutoff of 2.5× upper limit of normal as an additional adverse prognostic factor.""","""['Jörg Beyer', 'Laurence Collette', 'Nicolas Sauvé', 'Gedske Daugaard', 'Darren R Feldman', 'Torgrim Tandstad', 'Alexey Tryakin', 'Olof Stahl', 'Enrique Gonzalez-Billalabeitia', 'Ugo De Giorgi', 'Stéphane Culine', 'Ronald de Wit', 'Aaron R Hansen', 'Marko Bebek', 'Angelika Terbuch', 'Costantine Albany', 'Marcus Hentrich', 'Jourik A Gietema', 'Helene Negaard', 'Robert A Huddart', 'Anja Lorch', 'Fay H Cafferty', 'Daniel Y C Heng', 'Christopher J Sweeney', 'Eric Winquist', 'Michal Chovanec', 'Christian Fankhauser', 'Daniel Stark', 'Peter Grimison', 'Andrea Necchi', 'Ben Tran', 'Axel Heidenreich', 'Jonathan Shamash', 'Cora N Sternberg', 'David J Vaughn', 'Ignacio Duran', 'Carsten Bokemeyer', 'Anna Patrikidou', 'Richard Cathomas', 'Samson Assele', 'Silke Gillessen;International Germ Cell Cancer Classification Update Consortium']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Predicting Outcomes in Men With Metastatic Nonseminomatous Germ Cell Tumors (NSGCT): Results From the IGCCCG Update Consortium.', 'A risk-adapted study of cisplatin and etoposide, with or without ifosfamide, in patients with metastatic seminoma: results of the GETUG S99 multicenter prospective study.', 'Chemotherapy intensification in patients with advanced seminoma and adverse prognostic factors.', 'Reclassification of good-risk seminoma: prognostic factors, novel biomarkers and implications for clinical management.', 'Management of testicular seminoma advanced disease.

However, while often discussed this has seldom been explored, particularly across cancer types and at variable time frames posttrial completion. We examined comprehensive registry data (January 2014 to June 2019) for standard first-line treatments for metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), advanced pancreatic cancer (PC), metastatic HER2-amplified breast cancer (BC) and castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CaP). Registry patient characteristics and outcomes were compared to the practice-changing trial. Registry patients were older than the matched trial cohort by a median of 2-6 years (all P = <.01) for the CRC, BC and PC cohorts. The proportion of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0-1 patients was lower for CRC (94.1% vs 99.2%, P = .001) and BC (94.9% vs 99.3%, P = .001). Progression-free survival (PFS) for registry patients was similar to the trial patients or significantly longer (CaP, Hazard Ratio [HR] = 0.65, P = <.001). Overall survival (OS) was also similar or significantly longer (CaP, HR 0.49, P = <.001). In conclusion, despite real-world patients sometimes being older or having inferior PS to trial cohorts, the survival outcomes achieved were consistently equal or superior to those reported for the same treatment in the trial. We suggest that this is potentially due to optimised use of each treatment over time, improved multidisciplinary care and increased postprogression options. We can reassure clinicians and patients that outcomes matching or exceeding those reported in trials are possible. The potential for survival gains over time should routinely be factored into future trial statistical plans.""","""['Louise Kostos', 'Wei Hong', 'Belinda Lee', 'Ben Tran', 'Sheau Wen Lok', 'Angelyn Anton', 'Grace Gard', 'Yat Hang To', 'Vanessa Wong', 'Jeremy Shapiro', 'Rachel Wong', 'Shirley Wong', 'Richard de Boer', 'Peter Gibbs']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Differences in Trial and Real-world Populations in the Dutch Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Registry.', 'Second-Line Cabazitaxel Treatment in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Compared to Standard of Care in CAPRI: Observational Study in the Netherlands.', 'Real-World Outcomes in First-Line Treatment of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: The Prostate Cancer Registry.', 'Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors for metastatic colorectal cancer.', 'Vascular-endothelial-growth-factor (VEGF) targeting therapies for endocrine refractory or resistant metastatic breast cancer.', 'Real-World Outcomes of Belantamab Mafodotin for Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma (RRMM): Preliminary Results of a Spanish Expanded Access Program (EAP).', 'Leveraging Comprehensive Cancer Registry Data to Enable a Broad Range of Research, Audit and Patient Support Activities.', 'Rationale, Strengths, and Limitations of Real-World Evidence in Oncology: A Canadian Review and Perspective.']"""

Compared with traditional fee-for-service Medicare (TM), Medicare Advantage (MA) is more strongly financially incentivized to decrease use of low-value care.  Objectives:   To compare use of low-value care among individuals enrolled in TM and those enrolled in MA overall and to examine trends in use of low-value care in both programs from 2006 to 2015.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cross-sectional study analyzed individuals enrolled in TM and MA using data from the 2006 to 2015 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. To account for differences in characteristics between individuals enrolled in TM and those enrolled in MA, a propensity score-based approach was used. Data were analyzed from August 2020 through January 2021.  Exposures:   Being enrolled in MA or TM.  Main outcomes and measures:   Binary measures of use were collected for 13 low-value services in 4 categories (ie, [1] cancer screening: cervical, colorectal, and prostate cancer screening in older adults; [2] antibiotic use: antibiotic for acute upper respiratory infection and antibiotic for influenza; [3] medication: anxiolytic, sedative, or hypnotic in an adult older than 65 years; benzodiazepine for depression; opioid for headache; opioid for back pain; and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug [NSAID] for hypertension, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease; and [4] imaging: magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or computed tomography [CT] for back pain, radiograph for back pain, and MRI or CT for headache) and 4 low-value composites corresponding to the categories (ie, cancer screening composite, antibiotic use composite, medication composite, and imaging composite).  Results:   Among 11 677 individuals enrolled in TM and 5164 individuals enrolled in MA, 9429 (56.0%) were women and the mean (SD) age was 74.5 (6.3) years. Of 13 low-value services and 4 low-value composites, statistically significant differences were found in 2 measures. For the low-value medication composite, 2054 of 11 636 eligible individuals enrolled in TM (adjusted mean, 17.6%; 95% CI, 16.8%-18.3%) received the care, and 981 of 5141 eligible individuals enrolled in MA (adjusted mean, 19.7%; 95% CI, 18.3%-21.2%) received the care, for a rate of use that was significantly higher among individuals enrolled in MA, by 2.2 percentage points (95% CI, 0.5-3.8 percentage points; P = .02). For the NSAID use for hypertension, heart failure, or kidney disease metric, 807 of 7832 individuals enrolled in TM (adjusted mean, 10.0%; 95% CI, 9.2%-10.8%) received the care, and 447 of 3566 individuals enrolled in MA (adjusted mean, 12.9%; 95% CI, 19.7%-27.1%) received the care, for a rate of use that was significantly higher among individuals enrolled in MA, by 2.9 percentage points (95% CI, 1.3-4.6 percentage points; P = .001). Overall, there were no decreases in use of low-value care in TM or MA over time.

Cabazitaxel, a second-generation taxane, has been used for the CRPC treatment, but its tolerance is an urgent problem to be solved. In this study, to elucidate the acquisition mechanism of the cabazitaxel-resistance, we established cabazitaxel-resistant prostate cancer 22Rv1 (Cab-R) cells, which exhibited ∼sevenfold higher LD50 against cabazitaxel than the parental 22Rv1 cells. Cab-R cells showed marked increases in nuclear accumulation of NF-E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) and expression of Nrf2-inducible antioxidant enzymes compared to 22Rv1 cells, suggesting that Nrf2 signalling is homeostatically activated in Cab-R cells. The cabazitaxel sensitivity of Cab-R cells was enhanced by silencing of Nrf2, and that of 22Rv1 cells was reduced by activation of Nrf2. Halofuginone (HF) has been recently identified as a potent Nrf2 synthetic inhibitor, and its treatment of Cab-R cells not only suppressed the Nrf2 signalling by decreasing both nuclear and cytosolic Nrf2 protein levels, but also significantly augmented the cabazitaxel sensitivity. Thus, inhibition of Nrf2 signalling may be effective in overcoming the cabazitaxel resistance in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Satoshi Endo', 'Mina Kawai', 'Manami Hoshi', 'Jin Segawa', 'Mei Fujita', 'Takuo Matsukawa', 'Naohiro Fujimoto', 'Toshiyuki Matsunaga', 'Akira Ikari']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Biochem""","""['YM155 Reverses Cabazitaxel Resistance in Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer by Reducing Survivin Expression.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Marked response to cabazitaxel in prostate cancer xenografts expressing androgen receptor variant 7 and reversion of acquired resistance by anti-androgens.', 'Immunotherapeutic role of cabazitaxel treatment in the activation of TLR3 signalling in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in vitro.', 'Preclinical profile of cabazitaxel.', 'Pharmacological Significance of Heme Oxygenase 1 in Prostate Cancer.', 'Antiandrogenic Effects of a Polyphenol in Carex kobomugi through Inhibition of Androgen Synthetic Pathway and Downregulation of Androgen Receptor in Prostate Cancer Cell Lines.', 'The ERα-NRF2 signalling axis promotes bicalutamide resistance in prostate cancer.', 'NRF2: A crucial regulator for mitochondrial metabolic shift and prostate cancer progression.', 'mRNA-Modified FUS/NRF2 Signalling Inhibits Ferroptosis and Promotes Prostate Cancer Growth.']"""

Methods:   Data were obtained from population-based PROFILES registry cohorts, including colon, rectum, prostate or thyroid cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma (MM), melanoma, or basal cell carcinoma (BCC)/squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). All patients completed the EORTC QLQ-C30 from which self-perceived cognitive functioning, fatigue, functioning, and global health status/quality of life (GHS/QoL) were used. The PROFILES registry data were linked with the Netherlands Cancer Registry to obtain sociodemographic and clinical data.  Results:   Six thousand seven hundred eighty-six survivors were included (response rate=76%). Survivors, except for melanoma and BCC/SCC, reported on average lower self-perceived cognitive functioning scores compared to their matched controls (all p's<0.01). Largest differences with the norm were observed in thyroid cancer, HL, NHL and MM, and younger survivors (<50 years). Survivors with lower emotional functioning and more fatigue were more likely to report impaired self-perceived cognitive functioning.  Conclusion:   Self-perceived impaired cognitive functioning is prevalent among a wide range of cancer survivors, especially among survivors <50 years. Approaches targeting cognitive problems including attention for co-occurring symptoms such as fatigue and emotional impairments are needed to improve care for these patients.  Implications for cancer survivors:   Cancer survivors and clinicians should be aware that impaired self-perceived cognitive functioning is a frequently reported consequence of cancer and its treatment among survivors of various cancer types.

The results of LC-MS/MS were confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for transmembrane protein 143, cadherin 5, fibronectin 1, and collectin-11 in the serum.

The incidence and prevalence of prostate cancer has increased in Japan, as westernized lifestyles become more popular. Recent advances in genetic epidemiology, including genome-wide association studies (GWASs), have identified considerable numbers of human genetic factors associated with diseases. Several GWASs have reported significant loci associated with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. One GWAS, which was based on classic GWAS microarray measurements, has been reported for Japanese so far. In the present study, we conducted a GWAS of serum PSA using 1000Genomes imputed GWAS data (n =1,216) from the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort (J-MICC) Study, to detect candidate novel genetic loci that influence serum PSA levels in Japanese. The association of SNPs/genetic variants with serum PSA as a continuous variable was tested using the linear Wald test. SNP rs10000006 in SGMS2 (sphingomyelin synthase 2) on chromosome 4 had genome-wide significance (P <5×10-8), and eight variants on three chromosomes (chromosomes 12, 14, 15) had genome-wide suggestive levels of significance (P <1×10-6). With an independent data set from the J-MICC Shizuoka Study (n = 2,447), the association of the SGMS2 SNP with blood PSA levels was not replicated. Although our GWAS failed to detect novel loci associated with serum PSA levels in the Japanese cohort, it confirmed the significant effects of previously reported genetic loci on PSA levels in Japanese. Importantly, our results confirmed the significance of KLK3 SNPs also in Japanese, implying that consideration of individual genetic information in prostate cancer diagnosis may be possible in the future.""","""['Asahi Hishida', 'Masahiro Nakatochi', 'Takashi Tamura', 'Mako Nagayoshi', 'Rieko Okada', 'Yoko Kubo', 'Mineko Tsukamoto', 'Yuka Kadomatsu', 'Sadao Suzuki', 'Takeshi Nishiyama', 'Nagato Kuriyama', 'Isao Watanabe', 'Toshiro Takezaki', 'Daisaku Nishimoto', 'Kiyonori Kuriki', 'Kokichi Arisawa', 'Sakurako Katsuura-Kamano', 'Haruo Mikami', 'Miho Kusakabe', 'Isao Oze', 'Yuriko N Koyanagi', 'Yasuyuki Nakamura', 'Aya Kadota', 'Chisato Shimanoe', 'Keitaro Tanaka', 'Hiroaki Ikezaki', 'Masayuki Murata', 'Michiaki Kubo', 'Yukihide Momozawa', 'Kenji Takeuchi', 'Kenji Wakai;for the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort (J-MICC) Study Group']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Nagoya J Med Sci""","""['Association between KLK3 rs2735839 G/A polymorphism and serum PSA levels in Japanese men.', 'Genome-wide association study identified novel genetic variant on SLC45A3 gene associated with serum levels prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in a Chinese population.', 'Genetic variants at 1q32.1, 10q11.2 and 19q13.41 are associated with prostate-specific antigen for prostate cancer screening in two Korean population-based cohort studies.', 'Genetic predisposition to prostate cancer.', 'A systematic review of replication studies of prostate cancer susceptibility genetic variants in high-risk men originally identified from genome-wide association studies.', 'Assessment of factors associated with PSA level in prostate cancer cases and controls from three geographical regions.']"""

Aims:   The aim of this study is to document the annual frequency and distribution of urological diseases at the Usmanu Danfodiyo University Teaching Hospital, Sokoto.  Settings and design:   A cross-sectional retrospective study from January 2016 to December 2016 of all new patients seen at the urology outpatient clinic, emergency department as well as inpatient referrals from other departments of Usmanu Danfodiyo University Teaching Hospital, Sokoto, Nigeria.  Materials and methods:   The relevant records were extracted from the patient's case notes and entered into a semistructured questionnaire.  Statistical analysis used:   Data were analyzed using the SPSS software version 20.  Results:   A total of 607 new patients were seen over the study period. There were 576 (94.9%) males and 31 (5.1%) females, with a male-to-female ratio of 18.6:1. The median age was 45 years, with age range of 1-106 years. Urological emergencies were seen in 35.0% patients. Ninety-one percent of cases were acquired, whereas 8.2% were of congenital etiology. Overall, the most commonly diagnosed urologic diseases among new patients in order of decreasing frequency were benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) (18.6%), bladder tumor (11.8%), upper tract urinary calculi (10.3%), urethral stricture (8.9%), and prostate adenocarcinoma (7.4%).  Conclusions:   BPE, bladder tumor, upper tract urinary calculi, urethral stricture, and prostate adenocarcinoma are common in our environment.

We hypothesized that cotargeting androgen receptor and cell cycle with palbociclib would improve outcomes in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC).  Patients and methods:   A total of 60 patients with RB-intact mHSPC were randomized (1:2) to Arm 1: androgen deprivation (AD) or Arm 2: AD + palbociclib. Primary endpoint was PSA response rate (RR) after 28 weeks of therapy. Secondary endpoints included safety, PSA, and clinical progression-free survival (PFS), as well as PSA and radiographic RR. Tumors underwent exome sequencing when available. Circulating tumor cells (CTC) were enumerated at various timepoints.  Results:   A total of 72 patients with mHSPC underwent metastatic disease biopsy and 64 had adequate tissue for RB assessment. A total of 62 of 64 (97%) retained RB expression. A total of 60 patients initiated therapy (Arm 1: 20; Arm 2: 40). Neutropenia was the most common grade 3/4 adverse event in Arm 2. Eighty percent of patients (Arm 1: 16/20, Arm 2: 32/40; P = 0.87) met primary PSA endpoint ≤4 ng/mL at 28 weeks. PSA undetectable rate at 28 weeks was 50% and 43% in Arms 1 and 2, respectively (P = 0.5). Radiographic RR was 89% in both arms.

Melanoma differentiation-associated gene-7/IL24 (MDA-7/IL24) has profound tumor-specific cytotoxic effects in a broad spectrum of cancers. Here we report the enhanced therapeutic impact of genetically engineering mouse tumor-reactive or antigen-specific T cells to produce human MDA-7/IL24. While mock-transduced T cells only killed antigen-expressing tumor cells, MDA-7/IL24-producing T cells destroyed both antigen-positive and negative cancer targets. MDA-7/IL24-expressing T cells were superior to their mock-engineered counterparts in suppressing mouse prostate cancer and melanoma growth as well as metastasis. This enhanced antitumor potency correlated with increased tumor infiltration and expansion of antigen-specific T cells as well as induction of a Th1-skewed immunostimulatory tumor environment. MDA-7/IL24-potentiated T-cell expansion was dependent on T-cell-intrinsic STAT3 signaling. Finally, MDA-7/IL24-modified T-cell therapy significantly inhibited progression of spontaneous prostate cancers in Hi-Myc transgenic mice. Taken together, arming T cells with tumoricidal and immune-potentiating MDA-7/IL24 confers new capabilities of eradicating antigen-negative cancer cell clones and improving T-cell expansion within tumors. This promising approach may be used to optimize cellular immunotherapy for treating heterogeneous solid cancers and provides a mechanism for inhibiting tumor escape.

Bloom (BLM) helicase, a crucial member of the family of genome surveillance proteins, plays an essential role in DNA metabolic and repair pathways, including DNA replication, repair, transcription, recombination during chromosome segregation, and assuring telomere stability. The unwinding of G4DNA requires the participation of DNA helicase, which is crucial for maintaining chromosomal stability in cancer cells. Using fluorescence polarization and the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), this study aimed to investigate the DNA-binding and unwinding properties of BLM helicase, cloned and purified from prostate cancer cells, toward G4DNA. The results revealed that BLM helicase derived from prostate cancer cells could bind and unwind G4DNA. The molecular affinity of bond between G4DNA and the helicase was dependent on the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) terminals in G4DNA; the helicase was effectively bound to the G4DNA when the helicase monomer sufficiently covered approximately 10 nucleotides at the 3' or 5' ssDNA tail of G4DNA. For the unwinding of G4DNA, there was an apparent requirement of a 3' ssDNA tail and ATP; a G4DNA with only a 3' ssDNA tail was identified to be the most suitable substrate to be unwound by BLM helicase and required 3' ssDNA tails of at least 10 nt in length for efficient unwinding. Besides, BLM helicase was loosely bound and partly unwound the blunt-ended G4DNA. Although further mechanistic studies are warranted, the experimental results presented in this study are beneficial to further our understanding of the functional implication of BLM helicase in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Xu-Hui Zhu', 'Bao-Fei Sun', 'Mei Luo', 'Jia Yu', 'Yun-Dong Zhang', 'Hou-Qiang Xu', 'Heng Luo']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Biol Macromol""","""['Competition between the DNA unwinding and strand pairing activities of the Werner and Bloom syndrome proteins.', 'Mechanism and substrate specificity of telomeric protein POT1 stimulation of the Werner syndrome helicase.', 'Single-molecule visualization of human BLM helicase as it acts upon double- and single-stranded DNA substrates.', 'The role of post-translational modifications in fine-tuning BLM helicase function during DNA repair.', 'Telomeres: structures in need of unwinding.']"""

We obtained the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 8a, 8e and 9c in prostate cancer cells and based on high selectivity of 9c to PC-3 cells, we determined the mechanism of this compound to induce cell death through different methods. We show here that 9c compound induces cell cycle arrest in G2/M, increasing the levels of reactive oxygen species and DNA damage, and triggers DNA damage response by ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and histone H2AX phosphorylation induction. The compound also led PC-3 to lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial depolarization which triggered the activation of intrinsic pathway, confirmed by increase of cleaved caspase-9 and 3.

The percentage overlap between the R/B and PTV were highly correlated to the doses to the relevant OAR, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.63 for the rectum volume percentage receiving more than 75 Gy (RV75Gy) and R2 of 0.91 for the bladder volume percentage receiving more than 70 Gy (BV70Gy).

A 95% prediction interval assisted in identifying individualized R/B planning goals. The R/B-PTV percentage overlap has a high reliability in estimating sparing of the R/B.

The net effect of this technology on Medicaid spending has not been assessed.  Objective:   To identify the association of the local availability of robotic surgical technology with choice of initial treatment for prostate cancer and total prostate cancer-related treatment costs.  Design and participants:   This cohort study used New York State Medicaid data to examine the experience of 9564 Medicaid beneficiaries 40-64 years old who received a prostate biopsy between 2008 and 2017 and were diagnosed with prostate cancer. The local availability of robotic surgical technology was measured as distance from zip code centroids of patient's residence to the nearest hospital with a robot and the annual number of robotic prostatectomies performed in the Hospital Referral Region.  Main measures:   Multivariate linear models were used to relate regional access to robots to the choice of initial therapy and prostate cancer treatment costs during the year after diagnosis.  Key results:   The mean age of the sample of 9564 men was 58 years; 30% of the sample were White, 26% were Black, and 22% were Hispanic. Doubling the distance to the nearest hospital with a robot was associated with a reduction in robotic surgery rates of 3.7 percentage points and an increase in the rate of use of radiation therapy of 5.2 percentage points. Increasing the annual number of robotic surgeries performed in a region by 10 was associated with a decrease in the probability of undergoing radiation therapy of 0.6 percentage point and a $434 reduction in total prostate cancer-related costs per Medicaid patient.  Conclusions:   A full accounting of the costs of a new technology will depend on when it is used and the payment rate for its use relative to payment rates for substitutes.""","""['Hansoo Ko', 'Sherry A Glied']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Gen Intern Med""","""['Systematic review and economic modelling of the relative clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic surgery and robotic surgery for removal of the prostate in men with localised prostate cancer.', 'Accessibility to surgical robot technology and prostate-cancer patient behavior for prostatectomy.', 'Robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery for gynecologic and urologic oncology: an evidence-based analysis.', 'Comparative cost-effectiveness of robot-assisted and standard laparoscopic prostatectomy as alternatives to open radical prostatectomy for treatment of men with localised prostate cancer: a health technology assessment from the perspective of the UK National Health Service.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   We identified urethral cancer patients within Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results registry (SEER, 2004-2016). Age-standardized incidence rates per 1,000,000 (ASR) were calculated. Log linear regression analyses were used to compute average annual percent change (AAPC).  Results:   From 2004 to 2016, 1907 patients with urethral cancer were diagnosed (ASR 1.69; AAPC: -0.98%, p = 0.3). ASR rates were higher in males than in females (2.70 vs. 0.55), respectively and did not change over the time (both p = 0.3). Highest incidence rates were recorded in respectively ≥75 (0.77), 55-74 (0.71) and ≤54 (0.19) years of age categories, in that order. African Americans exhibited highest incidence rate (3.33) followed by Caucasians (1.72), other race groups (1.57) and Hispanics (1.57), in that order. A significant decrease occurred over time in Hispanics, but not in other race groups. In African Americans, male and female sex-stratified incidence rates were higher than in any other race group. Urothelial histological subtype exhibited highest incidence rate (0.92), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (0.41), adenocarcinoma (0.29) and other histologies (0.20).

We sought to compare the performance of two genomic tests in predicting post-RP oncological outcomes.  Methods:   A cohort of 16 post-RP patients with adverse pathological features who had obtained both Decipher (D) and Prolaris (P) testing. The Pearson correlation was used to compare scores from D and cell cycle progression (CCP) from P. Then, we derived a microarray CCP (mCCP) from D and correlated with P-CCP. The associations of D and mCCP with biochemical recurrence (BCR) and metastasis (M) was evaluated in multivariable survival analysis (MVA) in a large cohort of RP patients treated at Johns Hopkins University (1992-2010). In addition, we characterized the expression of the 31 P-CCP genes and mCCP scores in a cohort of 17,967 RP samples from Decipher platform.  Results:   There was significant correlation between the D score and P-CCP (r = 0.67, p = 0.004), and between the 10-year probability of BCR reported by P and 5-year probability of M reported by D (r = 0.69, p = 0.003). In this cohort, mCCP derived from the D platform was highly correlated to the reported P-CCP scores from the P platform (r = 0.88, p = 6.7e-6). In a comparative retrospective RP cohort, both mCCP and D were significantly associated with M outcome (p < 0.01 for both). On MVA, D was a predictor of M (HR 1.3, 95% CI [1.12-1.52], p = 0.0005), while mCCP was not a predictor of M (p = 0.62). In the D platform cohort, the 31 P-CCP genes were correlated to each other, and TOP2A was the most correlated to mCCP (r = 0.7).  Conclusions:   We found that P and D scores post-RP were correlated and help in identifying patients who at high risk of BCR in this cohort.

Cyproterone acetate (CPA), the steroidal anti-androgen for part of androgen deprivation therapy, may block the androgen-receptor interaction and then reduce serum testosterone through its weak anti-gonadotropic action. In addition to CPA inducing hepatitis, CPA is known to cause liver tumors in rats also. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a cytoplasmic receptor and regulates multiple physiological functions. CYP1A1 is an AhR-targeted gene. We found that CPA induced CYP1A1 expression, transcriptional activity of the aryl hydrocarbon response element (AHRE), and the nuclear localization of AhR in mouse Hepa-1c1c7 cells. However, CPA suppressed CYP1A1 mRNA expression and the transcriptional activity of AHRE in human HepG2 and MCF7 cells, and also decreased AhR ligand-induced CYP1A1 protein expression and transcriptional activity of AHRE in HepG2 cells. In summary, CPA is an AhR agonist in mouse cells, but an AhR antagonist in human cells. Accordingly, CPA potentially plays a role as an endocrine disruptor of the AhR. This study helps us to understand why CPA induces acute hepatitis, gene mutation, and many other side effects. In addition, it may trigger further studies investigating the relationships between CPA, glucocorticoid receptor and castration-resistant prostate cancer in the future.""","""['Chih-Shou Chen', 'Guan-Lun Gao', 'Dong-Ru Ho', 'Chih-Yi Lin', 'Yu-Ting Chou', 'Shan-Chun Chen', 'Min-Cong Huang', 'Wen-Ya Kao', 'Jyan-Gwo Joseph Su']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['The p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 induces cytochrome P450 1A1 gene expression in murine and human hepatoma cell lines through ligand-dependent aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation.', 'Activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor reduces carbendazim-induced cell death.', 'Cyprodinil as an activator of aryl hydrocarbon receptor.', 'Indole-3-carbinol induces tumor cell death: function follows form.', 'How the AHR Became Important in Cancer: The Role of Chronically Active AHR in Cancer Aggression.', 'Risk Assessment of Transgender People: Development of Rodent Models Mimicking Gender-Affirming Hormone Therapies and Identification of Sex-Dimorphic Liver Genes as Novel Biomarkers of Sex Transition.', 'Integrative pan-cancer landscape of MMS22L and its potential role in hepatocellular carcinoma.']"""

By performing genome-wide ChIP-seq profiling in ENZ-resistant CRPC cells we identify a set of androgen receptor (AR) binding sites with increased AR binding intensity (ARBS-gained). While ARBS-gained loci lack the canonical androgen response elements (ARE) and pioneer factor FOXA1 binding motifs, they are highly enriched with CpG islands and the binding sites of unmethylated CpG dinucleotide-binding protein CXXC5 and the partner TET2. RNA-seq analysis reveals that both CXXC5 and its regulated genes including ID1 are upregulated in ENZ-resistant cell lines and these results are further confirmed in patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and patient specimens. Consistent with the finding that ARBS-gained loci are highly enriched with H3K27ac modification, ENZ-resistant PCa cells, organoids, xenografts and PDXs are hyper-sensitive to NEO2734, a dual inhibitor of BET and CBP/p300 proteins.

Prostate cancer patients survive decades after prostate cancer brachytherapy, with unclear long-term toxicity profiles. We therefore evaluated prostate cancer patients who had received I-125 brachytherapy treatment (14,400 cGy) 14-24 years prior and assessed their long-term quality of life based on urinary, bowel, and sexual function.  Methods and materials:   We performed a single-institutional, retrospective analysis of 39 men who received brachytherapy between 1996 and 2005. Analysis was based on physician evaluations, laboratory values, and International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) results.  Results:   At last followup, the mean patient age was 80 years (median 81 years), with a mean of 17.8 years posttreatment followup. Fifteen percent of patients had experienced recurrence. Urinary symptoms were limited, with 0% of patients reporting dysuria, 13% reporting incontinence, and 33% on medication for urinary symptoms. Average times nocturia was 1.7 with mean IPSS of 6.4. With regard to bowel symptoms, 3% of patients reported incontinence, 8% noted diarrhea, 3% had rectal bleeding, 8% noted constipation, and no patients required prescription medication for bowel function. Thirty-nine percent of patients potent before treatment reported being potent with or without medication.  Conclusions:   Prostate cancer survivors, postbrachytherapy treatment, have an overall good quality of life for many years to come. Urinary and bowel symptoms are limited, IPSS scores are generally low, and patients who consider sexual function important at their stage in life are frequently found to be potent.

Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective cohort study used a US commercial claims database from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2018. A total of 11 457 men aged 18 to 64 years who underwent inpatient radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer and were continuously enrolled with medical and prescription drug coverage from 180 days before to 365 days after inpatient prostatectomy were identified. An inverse probability of treatment weighting analysis was performed to examine the differences in costs and use of health care services by surgical modality. Data analysis was conducted from September 2019 to July 2020.  Exposures:   Type of surgical procedure: ORP vs RARP.  Main outcomes and measures:   Three outcomes within 1 year after the inpatient prostatectomy were investigated: (1) total health care costs, including reimbursement paid by insurers and out of pocket by patients; (2) health care use, including inpatient readmission, emergency department, hospital outpatient, and office visits; and (3) estimated days missed from work due to health care use.  Results:   Of the 11 457 patients who underwent inpatient prostatectomy, 1604 (14.0%) had ORP and 9853 (86.0%) had RARP and most patients (8467 [73.9%]) were aged 55 to 64 years. Compared with patients who underwent ORP, those who received RARP had a higher cost at the index hospitalization (mean difference, $2367; 95% CI, $1821-$2914; P < .001), but similar total cumulative costs were observed within 180 days (mean difference, $397; 95% CI, -$582 to $1375; P = .43) and 1 year after discharge (-$383; 95% CI, -$1802 to $1037; P = .60). One-year postdischarge health care use was significantly lower in the RARP compared with ORP group for mean numbers of emergency department visits (-0.09 visits; 95% CI, -0.11 to -0.07 visits; P < .001) and hospital outpatient visits (-1.5 visits; -1.63 to -1.36 visits; P < .001). The reduction in use of health care services among patients who underwent RARP translated into additional savings of $2929 (95% CI, $1600-$4257; P < .001) and approximately 1.69 fewer days (95% CI, 1.49-1.89 days; P < .001) missed from work for health care visits.  Conclusions and relevance:   Total cumulative cost in this study was similar between ORP and RARP 1 year post discharge; this finding suggests that lower postdischarge health care use after RARP may offset the higher costs during the index hospitalization.""","""['Kennedy E Okhawere', 'I-Fan Shih', 'Shih-Hao Lee', 'Yanli Li', 'Jaime A Wong', 'Ketan K Badani']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Costs of Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy 1 Year After Surgery: Pay Now and Save Later?', 'Patterns-of-care and health economic analysis of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in the Australian public health system.', 'Hospitalization costs for radical prostatectomy attributable to robotic surgery.', 'Health resource use after robot-assisted surgery vs open and conventional laparoscopic techniques in oncology: analysis of English secondary care data for radical prostatectomy and partial nephrectomy.', 'Cost of New Technologies in Prostate Cancer Treatment: Systematic Review of Costs and Cost Effectiveness of Robotic-assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy, Intensity-modulated Radiotherapy, and Proton Beam Therapy.', 'Long-term cancer control outcomes of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer treatment: a meta-analysis.', 'Embracing robotic surgery in low- and middle-income countries: Potential benefits, challenges, and scope in the future.', 'Patients Regret Their Choice of Therapy Significantly Less Frequently after Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy as Opposed to Open Radical Prostatectomy: Patient-Reported Results of the Multicenter Cross-Sectional IMPROVE Study.', 'Single-site multiport vs. conventional multiport robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: A propensity score matching comparative study.', 'Systematic literature review of cost-effectiveness analyses of robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy for localised prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of 1-Year Health Care Expenditures and Utilization Following Minimally Invasive vs Open Nephrectomy.']"""

Methods:   In this study, we explored the inhibitory dynamics of Compound 38 (Cpd38), a newly synthesized Bromodomain-containing protein 4 bromodomain 1 (BRD4-BD1) protein inhibitor derived from the synthetic coupling of Fragment 47 (Fgt47) into ABBV-075 scaffold. Using dynamic simulation methods, we unraveled the augmentative effects of chemical fragmentation on improved BRD4- BD1 inhibition.  Results:   Findings from this study revealed that although Fgt47 exhibited a considerable ΔGbind, its incorporation into the difluoro-phenoxy pyridine scaffold (Cpd38) notably enhanced the binding affinity. Time-based analyses of interaction dynamics further revealed that the bulkiness of Cpd38 favored its interaction at the BRD4-BD1 active site relative to the fragment. Strikingly, compared to Fgt47, Cpd38 demonstrated high mobility, which could have enabled it to bind optimally and complementarily with key residues of the active site such as Ile146, Asn140, Cys136, Tyr98, Leu94, Val87, Phe83, and Trp81.  Discussion:   On the contrary, the majority of these interactions were gradually lost in Fgt47, which could further indicate the essence of coupling it with the difluoro-phenoxy pyridine scaffold. Furthermore, Cpd38 had a more altering effect on BRD4-BDI relative to Fgt47, which could also be a result of its higher inhibitory activity.  Conclusion:   Conclusively, the design of highly potent therapeutics could be facilitated by the incorporation of pharmacologically active small molecule fragments into the scaffold of existing drugs.""","""['Oluwole B Akawa', 'Opeyemi S Soremekun', 'Fisayo A Olotu', 'Mahmoud E S Solima']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Curr Pharm Biotechnol""","""['Atomistic insights into the selective therapeutic activity of 6-(2,4-difluorophenoxy)-5-((ethylmethyl)pyridine-3-yl)-8-methylpyrrolo1,2-apyrazin-1(2H)-one towards bromodomain-containing proteins.', 'Discovery of N-Ethyl-4-2-(4-fluoro-2,6-dimethyl-phenoxy)-5-(1-hydroxy-1-methyl-ethyl)phenyl-6-methyl-7-oxo-1H-pyrrolo2,3-cpyridine-2-carboxamide (ABBV-744), a BET Bromodomain Inhibitor with Selectivity for the Second Bromodomain.', 'Computational study on the selective inhibition mechanism of MS402 to the first and second bromodomains of BRD4.', 'Novel strategies targeting bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) for cancer drug discovery.', 'Bromodomain-Containing Protein 4: A Druggable Target.']"""

Combining the role of angiogenesis in tumor progression and the role of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) in angiogenesis, this study aims to explore the functions of PSMA in GBM.  Methods:   Clinical GBM specimens were collected from 60 patients who accepted surgical treatment in Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center between January 2018 and June 2019. Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect PSMA and CD31 expression in GBM tissues. Prognostic significance of PSMA was evaluated by bioinformatics. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) transfected with PSMA overexpression plasmids or cultured with conditioned medium collected based on GBM cells, were used for CCK8, Transwell and tube formation assays. High-throughput sequencing and immunoprecipitation were used to explore the underlying mechanism. Furthermore, the in vivo experiment had been also conducted.  Results:   We demonstrated that PSMA was abundantly expressed in endothelium of vessels of GBM tissues but not in vessels of normal tissues, which was significantly correlated with poor prognosis. Overexpression of PSMA could promotes proliferation, invasion and tube formation ability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Moreover, U87 or U251 conditioned medium could upregulated PSMA expression and induce similar effects on phenotypes of HUVECs, all of which could be partially attenuated by 2-PMPA treatment. The mechanistic study revealed that PSMA might promote angiogenesis of GBM through interacting with Integrin β4 (ITGB4) and activating NF-κB signaling pathway. The in vivo growth of GBM could be alleviated by the treatment of 2-PMPA.  Conclusion:   This study identified PSMA as a critical regulator in angiogenesis and progression of GBM, which might be a promising therapeutic target for GBM treatment.""","""['Yang Gao', 'Hui Zheng', 'Liangdong Li', 'Mingtao Feng', 'Xin Chen', 'Bin Hao', 'Zhongwei Lv', 'Xiaoyan Zhou', 'Yiqun Cao']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Front Cell Dev Biol""","""['Secreted phosphoprotein 1 promotes angiogenesis of glioblastoma through upregulating PSMA expression via transcription factor HIF1α.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen as a potential novel vascular target for treatment of glioblastoma multiforme.', 'RhoJ facilitates angiogenesis in glioblastoma via JNK/VEGFR2 mediated activation of PAK and ERK signaling pathways.', 'Targeting of prostate-specific membrane antigen for radio-ligand therapy of triple-negative breast cancer.', 'The autotaxin-lysophosphatidic acid-lysophosphatidic acid receptor cascade: proposal of a novel potential therapeutic target for treating glioblastoma multiforme.', 'Advances in PET imaging of cancer.', 'Gene Targets of CAR-T Cell Therapy for Glioblastoma.', 'The Potential of PSMA as a Vascular Target in TNBC.', 'Advances in Molecular Regulation of Prostate Cancer Cells by Top Natural Products of Malaysia.', 'The clinical application of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT and regulating mechanism of PSMA expression in patients with brain metastases of lung cancer.']"""

We developed novel compounds, derived from the potent inverse agonist K-(D-1-Nal)-FwLL-NH2 but structurally varied by lysine conjugation with 1,4,7-triazacyclononane,1-glutaric acid-4,7-acetic acid (NODAGA), palmitic acid and/or diethylene glycol (PEG2) to allow radiolabeling and improve pharmacokinetics, respectively. All compounds were tested for receptor binding, potency and efficacy in vitro, for biodistribution and -kinetics in rats and in preclinical prostate cancer models on mice. Radiolabeling with Cu-64 and Ga-68 was successfully achieved. The Cu-64- or Ga-68-NODAGA-NH-K-K-(D-1-NaI)-F-w-L-L-NH2 radiotracer were specifically accumulated by the GHS-R1a in xenotransplanted human prostate tumor models (PC-3, DU-145) in mice. The tumors were clearly delineated by PET. The radiotracer uptake was also partially blocked by K-(D-1-Nal)-FwLL-NH2 in stomach and thyroid. The presence of the GHS-R1a was also confirmed by immunohistology. In the arterial rat blood plasma, only the original compounds were found. The Cu-64 or Ga-68-NODAGA-NH-K-K-(D-1-NaI)-F-w-L-L-NH2 radiolabeled inverse agonists turned out to be potent and safe. Due to their easy synthesis, high affinity, medium potency, metabolic stability, and the suitable pharmacokinetic profiles, they are excellent tools for imaging and quantitation of GHS-R1a expression in normal and cancer tissues by PET.

Associations between circulating lipids and clinical outcomes were examined by Cox regression and latent class analysis.  Results:   Circulating lipid profiles featuring elevated levels of ceramide species were associated with metastatic relapse in localised PC (HR 5.80, 95% CI 3.04-11.1, P = 1 × 10-6), earlier testosterone suppression failure in mHSPC (HR 3.70, 95% CI 1.37-10.0, P = 0.01), and shorter overall survival in mCRPC (HR 2.54, 95% CI 1.73-3.72, P = 1 × 10-6).

We analyzed a cohort of patients with cancer and coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) reported to the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) to identify prognostic clinical factors, including laboratory measurements and anticancer therapies.  Patients and methods:   Patients with active or historical cancer and a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis recorded between 17 March and 18 November 2020 were included. The primary outcome was COVID-19 severity measured on an ordinal scale (uncomplicated, hospitalized, admitted to intensive care unit, mechanically ventilated, died within 30 days). Multivariable regression models included demographics, cancer status, anticancer therapy and timing, COVID-19-directed therapies, and laboratory measurements (among hospitalized patients).  Results:   A total of 4966 patients were included (median age 66 years, 51% female, 50% non-Hispanic white); 2872 (58%) were hospitalized and 695 (14%) died; 61% had cancer that was present, diagnosed, or treated within the year prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. Older age, male sex, obesity, cardiovascular and pulmonary comorbidities, renal disease, diabetes mellitus, non-Hispanic black race, Hispanic ethnicity, worse Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, recent cytotoxic chemotherapy, and hematologic malignancy were associated with higher COVID-19 severity. Among hospitalized patients, low or high absolute lymphocyte count; high absolute neutrophil count; low platelet count; abnormal creatinine; troponin; lactate dehydrogenase; and C-reactive protein were associated with higher COVID-19 severity. Patients diagnosed early in the COVID-19 pandemic (January-April 2020) had worse outcomes than those diagnosed later. Specific anticancer therapies (e.g. R-CHOP, platinum combined with etoposide, and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors) were associated with high 30-day all-cause mortality.

Methods and materials:   This was a prospective, multicenter phase 2 toxicity study enrolling patients with low to favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer. Before simulation, 3 to 4 fiducial markers along with a rectal spacer were placed. The target (prostate only) was prescribed 40 Gy, whereas the maximum dose to the urethra was limited to 33 Gy with the highest priority at planning; less stringent objectives were placed on the bladder, the filling of which was controlled via a Foley catheter. Treatment was delivered every other day. Toxicity was prospectively scored with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, and several patient-reported outcomes were collected. The maximum allowed prevalence rate of grade 2+ genitourinary (GU) toxicity at 1 year was set at 15%, and the study was sized accordingly.  Results:   Between November 2015 and May 2019, 59 patients were enrolled by 3 participating institutions. Acute gastrointestinal toxicity was occasional and mild, whereas 11.9% of patients developed acute grade 2 GU toxicity and 1.7% developed acute grade 3 GU toxicity. No patient had persistent treatment-related grade 2+ GU toxicity at 12 months after SBRT; thus, the null hypothesis was rejected. We observed a clinically relevant worsening of both International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF) scores at 12 months compared with baseline. Moreover, we found a strong association between all selected bladder dose/volume metrics at planning and ICIQ-SF worsening at 12 months, whereas for the IPSS, the correlation with bladder dose metrics was marginal.  Conclusions:   The results suggest that at 12 months after treatment, the toxicity profile of SBRT in 3 fractions is acceptable.""","""['Alessandro Magli', 'Alessia Farneti', 'Adriana Faiella', 'Mariaconsiglia Ferriero', 'Valeria Landoni', 'Diana Giannarelli', 'Eugenia Moretti', 'Ugo de Paula', 'Sara Gomellini', 'Giuseppe Sanguineti']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['A Prospective Single-Arm Phase 2 Study of Stereotactic Magnetic Resonance Guided Adaptive Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer: Early Toxicity Results.', 'Dose-Escalated Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Patients With Intermediate- and High-Risk Prostate Cancer: Initial Dosimetry Analysis and Patient Outcomes.', 'Receiver operating curves and dose-volume analysis of late toxicity with stereotactic body radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Phase 1 Trial of SBRT to the Prostate Fossa After Prostatectomy.', 'Patient and Dosimetric Predictors of Genitourinary and Bowel Quality of Life After Prostate SBRT: Secondary Analysis of a Multi-institutional Trial.', 'Stereotactic Ablative Radiation Therapy in 3 Fractions Induces a Favorable Systemic Immune Cell Profiling in Prostate Cancer Patients.', '1.5T MR-Guided Daily-Adaptive SBRT for Prostate Cancer: Preliminary Report of Toxicity and Quality of Life of the First 100 Patients.', 'Extreme Hypofractionation with SBRT in Localized Prostate Cancer.']"""

The clearance of intravenous docetaxel is higher in medically castrated prostate cancer patients as compared to patients with other types of solid tumours. Oral docetaxel requires co-administration ritonavir (r), which might further impact the pharmacokinetics (PK). We now compare the PK of docetaxel and ritonavir between patients with Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer (HSPC), metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) and other metastatic solid tumours, treated on the same dose and weekly schedule of ModraDoc006/r.  Methods:   The docetaxel and ritonavir PK were compared between four patient groups from three clinical phase I trials, including eight male and eight female patients with different types of solid tumours (study 1), seven patients with HSPC (study 2) and five patients with mCRPC (study 3). All patients were treated with ModraDoc006 30 mg and ritonavir 100 mg in the morning, followed by ModraDoc006 20 mg and ritonavir 100 mg in the evening (ModraDoc006/r 30-20/100-100). For comparative purposes, the PK of six mCRPC patients that received 30-20/200-100 in study 3 were also evaluated.  Results:   The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) was significantly lower for both docetaxel and ritonavir in the prostate cancer patients as compared to the patients with other types of solid tumours treated at ModraDoc006/r 30-20/100-100. The docetaxel area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) was significantly different at this dose, with a mean AUC0-48 of 1359 ± 374 ng/mL*h (N = 8) in female patients and 894 ± 223 ng/mL*h (N = 8) in male patients with different solid tumours (study 1), 321 ± 81 (N = 7) in HSPC (study 2) and 367 ± 182 ng/mL*h (N = 5) in mCRPC (study 3). A similar pattern was observed for ritonavir. ModraDoc006/r 30-20/200-100 in six mCRPC patients led to a comparable ritonavir exposure as compared to the patients at 30-20/100-100 in study 1 and increased the docetaxel AUC0-48 to 1266 ± 473 ng/mL*h (N = 6).  Conclusion:   The exposure to docetaxel and ritonavir was significantly lower in prostate cancer patients as compared to patients with other types of solid tumours, treated on ModraDoc006/r 30-20/100-100. An increase of the ritonavir dose increased the docetaxel exposure in mCRPC patients. Therefore, a different RP2D of ModraDoc006/r is pursued in castrated prostate cancer patients as compared to patients with other types of solid tumours.

Implementation of ePSA in clinical practice could help simplify patient monitoring in the remission phase.  Materials and methods:   A total of 49 PCa patients were examined by their PSA tests before prostatectomy and after 30 days, 91 days, and 24 months. Conventional PSA rate of change parameters (HT and DT) were compared to a new clinically understandable ePSA parameter.  Results:   We observed that implementation of inverse value (ePSA) rather than HT or DT has distinct advantages: (1) values are valid when PSA is unchanged (ePSA equals zero), (2) the concept of ePSA can be easily understood, as it is a growth fraction, (3) ePSA fluctuates within a narrow range and is thus easy to interpret, and (4) there are no mathematical flaws (no positive skewing).  Conclusion:   Exploring ePSA norm as ≤0% could help spot biochemical recurrence in a timely manner.

We evaluated bone scan lesion area (BSLA), a quantitative imaging assessment of response in patients with mCRPC receiving radium-223 alone or in combination with androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (abiraterone/prednisone or enzalutamide).  Patients and methods:   This randomized, non-comparative phase IIa three-arm trial (NCT02034552) evaluated technetium-99m-based BSLA response rate (RR), safety, radiologic progression-free survival (rPFS), and time to first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE) in men with mCRPC and bone metastases receiving radium-223 with/without abiraterone/prednisone or enzalutamide. The primary endpoint was week 24 BSLA RR.  Results:   Overall, 63 patients received treatment (abiraterone/prednisone combination, n = 22; enzalutamide combination, n = 22; radium-223 monotherapy, n = 19). Median treatment duration (first to last dose of any study treatment) was 12 months (abiraterone/prednisone combination), 10 months (enzalutamide combination), and 3 months (radium-223 monotherapy). Week 24 BSLA RR was 58% [80% confidence interval (CI) 41% to 74%; one-sided P < 0.0001; 11/19 patients] with abiraterone/prednisone combination, 50% (32% to 68%; one-sided P < 0.0001; 8/16 patients) with enzalutamide combination, and 22% (10% to 40%; one-sided P = 0.0109; 4/18 patients) with radium-223 monotherapy. Median rPFS was not evaluable for combination arms and 4 months (80% CI 4 to 12) for monotherapy. SSEs were reported in 32% of patients; median time to first SSE was not estimable. Fatigue and back pain were the most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs); more patients receiving combination therapy than monotherapy had TEAEs. Fractures were reported in 18% receiving abiraterone/prednisone, 32% receiving enzalutamide, and 11% receiving radium-223 monotherapy. Fracture rates were lower in patients taking bone health agents versus not taking bone health agents at baseline.  Conclusions:   Technetium-99m imaging BSLA may offer objective, quantifiable assessment of isotope uptake changes, and potentially treatment response, in patients with mCRPC and bone metastases treated with radium-223 alone or in combination with abiraterone/prednisone or enzalutamide. In this largely treatment-naive population, BSLA RR was numerically lower with radium-223 monotherapy versus combination therapy, indicating a limited role as first-line treatment.

Main methods:   CCK-8 and Colony formation assay were performed to detect the anti-proliferative effect of citrate on prostate cancer. Flow cytometry analysis was conducted to investigate the pro-apoptosis effect of citrate on prostate cancer. Immunofluorescence assay was taken to detect whether citrate induced autophagy in prostate cancer. Western blot and Immunohistochemical assay were performed to explore the underlying mechanism by which citrate activates autophagic death in prostate cancer cells. Xenograft tumorigenicity assay was conducted to explore whether citrate suppressed the growth of xenograft prostate tumors in vivo.  Key findings:   We found citrate could significantly induce apoptosis and autophagy of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, treatment with autophagy inhibitor (chloroquine) drastically suppresses the apoptosis rate of prostate cancer induced by citrate.

Background:   Chronological age is an imperfect measure of longevity. Biological age, a measure of overall health, may improve personalized care. This paper proposes a new way to estimate biological age using a convolutional neural network that takes as input a CXR image and outputs a chest x-ray age (in years) as a measure of long-term mortality risk.  Methods:   CXR-Age was developed using CXR from 116,035 individuals and validated in 2 held-out testing sets: 1) 75% of the CXR arm of PLCO (Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial) (N = 40,967); and 2) the CXR arm of NLST (National Lung Screening Trial) (N = 5,414). CXR-Age was compared to chronological age and a multivariable regression model of chronological age, risk factors, and radiograph findings to predict all-cause and cardiovascular mortality with a maximum 23 years and 13 years of follow-up, respectively. The primary outcome was observed mortality; results are provided for the testing datasets only.  Results:   In the PLCO testing dataset, a 5-year increase in CXR-Age carried a higher risk of all-cause mortality than a 5-year increase in chronological age (CXR-Age hazard ratio [HR]: 2.26 [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.24 to 2.29] vs. chronological age HR: 1.77 [95% CI: 1.75 to 1.78]; p < 0.001). A similar pattern was found for cardiovascular mortality (CXR-Age cause-specific HR: 2.45 per 5 years [95% CI: 2.34 to 2.56] vs. chronological age HR: 1.82 per 5 years [95% CI: 1.74 to 1.90]). Similar results were seen for both outcomes in the NLST external testing dataset. Adding CXR-Age to the multivariable model resulted in significant improvements for predicting both outcomes in both testing datasets (p < 0.001 for all comparisons).

Upregulated PTTG3P expression was performed to explore the role of PTTG3P in PCa cells resistant to ADT (androgen deprivation therapy). The relationship among PTTG3P, mir-146a-3p and PTTG1 were validated by qPCR, western blot and luciferase assay.  Results:   PTTG3P levels were significantly increased in the androgen-independent PC cell lines, as well as in CRPC tissues compared with those of the androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell line LNCaP and tumour tissues of patients with hormone-naive prostate cancers. Enforced expression of PTTG3P in androgen-deprived LNCaP cells significantly enhanced survival, clonogenicity, and tumorigenicity. Further, PTTG3P acted as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA, natural miRNA sponge) to upregulate PTTG1 expression by competing for mir-146a-3p in the progression to CRPC.

Increased both nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of MAGE-A3 was significantly found in PCa tissues compared with both HPIN and BPH tissues (nuclear expression at p = 0.011, and cytoplasmic expression at p = 0.034; for both comparisons p < 0.0001, respectively). A significant correlation was observed between higher nuclear and cytoplasmic expressions of MAGE-A3 with Gleason score (p < 0.0001 and 0.006, respectively).

Methods:   Multicentric population-based case-control study (MCC-Spain) conducted in 12 Spanish provinces. Participants were men and women between 20 and 85 years of age with diagnoses of colorectal (n = 1852), breast (n = 1486), or prostate cancer (n = 953), and population-based controls (n = 3543) frequency-matched by age, sex, and region. Dietary intake was collected using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Foods and drinks were categorized according to their degree of processing based on the NOVA classification. Unconditional multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between ultra-processed food and drink consumption and colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer.  Results:   In multiple adjusted models, consumption of ultra-processed foods and drinks was associated with a higher risk of colorectal cancer (OR for a 10% increase in consumption: 1.11; 95% CI 1.04-1.18). The corresponding odds for breast (OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.96-1.11) and prostate cancer (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.93-1.12) were indicative of no association.

A prospective database of patients undergoing RARP is maintained at our Institution since January 2015. We reviewed all patients undergoing RARP after previous colo-rectal surgery. Overall, 49 (7.4%) of 658 RARPs were performed after previous pelvic surgery, 14 (2.1%) of which following colo-rectal surgery after an interval of 5 years. (a) Colo-rectal surgery. Previous colo-rectal surgery included resection of the left colon (n = 6), and right colon (n = 4), and rectum (n = 4). Histopathology showed pT0-T2N0 in 5, pT3N0-1 in 3, and benign conditions in 4. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was elevated (4 ng/ml or greater) or slightly elevated (3.5-4 ng/ml) in 9 (65%) of 14 cases at the time of colo-rectal surgery. (b) Prostatectomy. Overall prostatectomy and adhesiolysis median operative times were 235 and 42 min, respectively. A robotic approach was accomplished in 11 cases with previous uncomplicated colo-rectal surgery; open conversion occurred in 3 cases. Risk factors for open conversion during RARP were: history of multiple or complicated abdominal surgery, previous open conversion, and hospital stay > 10 days. Postoperative complications included: anemization (n = 2), persistent drain output (n = 1), and urinary tract infection (n = 1). The robotic approach was successful in the case of previous uncomplicated colo-rectal surgery. The risk of intestinal injury during conversion might suggest a direct retropubic approach in case of previous multiple or complicated abdominal surgery.

Patients and methods:   We analysed 2650 men with prostate cancer from seven open (n = 805) and seven robotic (n = 1845) Swedish centres between 2008 and 2011 in a prospective non-randomised trial, LAPPRO. UC recovery was defined as change of pads less than once in 24 h. Information was collected through validated questionnaires. Rate of positive surgical margins (PSM) and biochemical recurrence (BCR), defined as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) > 0.25 mg/ml, were recorded. We stratified patients into two risk groups (low-intermediate and high risk) based on the D'Amico risk classification system.  Result:   Among men with high-risk prostate cancer, we found significantly higher rates of UC recovery up to 24 months after RRP compared to RALP (66.1% vs 60.5%) RR 0.85 (CI 95% 0.73-0.99) while PSM was more frequent after RRP compared to RALP (46.8% vs 23.5%) RR 1.56 (CI 95% 1.10-2.21).

Biochemical recurrence was defined as prostate-specific antigen > 0.02 ng/mL. Decipher score is reported as lower risk (< 0.6) and higher risk ≥ 0.60). Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to examine the relationship between Decipher score and time to biochemical recurrence (months). Cox regression was used to analyze the relationship between Decipher score and time to biochemical recurrence while controlling for a number of clinical characteristics. Secondary analyses focused on a subset of men with prostate-specific antigen > 0.02 and < 0.20 ng/mL to determine if high-risk Decipher scores were associated with receipt of salvage treatment.  Results:   A total of 203 cases were analyzed: 37.9% and 62.1% had lower and higher risk Decipher scores respectively, and 56.2% had a biochemical recurrence.

Factors that can predict the accuracy of IPLs contouring were analysed.  Results:   Diagnostic performance was significantly superior both for manual and automatic IPLs contouring using 68Ga-PSMA-PET/MRI (DSC/YI SUV70%-0.62/0.51), 18F-PSMA-PET/CT (DSC/YI SUV70%-0.67/0.53) or 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT (DSC/YI SUV70%-0.63/0.51) compared to mpMRI (DSC/YI-0.47/0.41; p < 0.001). The accuracy for delineating IPLs was not improved by combination of PET/CT and mpMRI images compared to PET/CT alone. Significantly superior diagnostic accuracy was found for large prostate lesions (at least 15% from the prostate volume) and higher Gleason score (at least 7b) comparing to smaller lesions with lower GS.

Due to the lack of suitable tools to analyze cellular ADPR levels, ADPR's significance for cancer progression and patient outcome is unclear. In this study, we assessed ADPR levels by immunohistochemistry using a newly developed anti-ADP-ribose (ADPr) antibody, which is able to detect both mono- and poly-ADPR. Tissue microarrays containing brain (n = 103), breast (n = 1108), colon (n = 236), lung (n = 138), ovarian (n = 142), and prostate (n = 328) cancers were used to correlate ADPR staining intensities to clinico-pathological data, including patient overall survival (OS), tumor grade, tumor stage (pT), lymph node status (pN), and the presence of distant metastasis (pM). While nuclear ADPR was detected only in a minority of the samples, cytoplasmic ADPR (cyADPR) staining was observed in most tumor types. Strong cyADPR intensities were significantly associated with better overall survival in invasive ductal breast cancer (p < 0.0001), invasive lobular breast cancer (p < 0.005), and high grade serous ovarian cancer patients (p < 0.01). Furthermore, stronger cytoplasmic ADPR levels significantly correlated with early tumor stage in colorectal and in invasive ductal breast adenocarcinoma (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.01, respectively) and with the absence of regional lymph node metastasis in colorectal adenocarcinoma (p < 0.05). No correlation to cyADPR was found for prostate and lung cancer or brain tumors. In conclusion, our new anti-ADP-ribose antibody revealed heterogeneous ADPR staining patterns with predominant cytoplasmic ADPR staining in most tumor types.

This evolution of resistance is due to heterogenous mechanisms which include AR mutations causing the identical drug to activate instead of inhibit the receptor. Understanding in molecular detail the paradoxical phenomenon wherein an AR antagonist is transformed into an agonist by structural mutations in the target receptor is thus of paramount importance. Herein, we describe a reciprocal paradox: opposing antagonist and agonist AR regulation determined uniquely by enantiomeric forms of the same drug structure. The antiandrogen BMS-641988, which has (R)-chirality at C-5 encompasses a previously uncharacterized (S)-stereoisomer that is, surprisingly, a potent agonist of AR, as demonstrated by transcriptional assays supported by cell imaging studies. This duality was reproduced in a series of novel compounds derived from the BMS-641988 scaffold. Coupled with in silico modeling studies, the results inform an AR model that explains the switch from potent antagonist to high-affinity agonist in terms of C-5 substituent steric interactions with helix 12 of the ligand binding site. They imply strategies to overcome AR drug resistance and demonstrate that insufficient enantiopurity in this class of AR antagonist can confound efforts to correlate structure with function.""","""['Katherin Patsch', 'Chao Liu', 'Grzegorz Zapotoczny', 'Yuanye Sun', 'Harish Sura', 'Nolan Ung', 'Ren X Sun', 'Bethany Haliday', 'Chen Yu', 'Mayada Aljehani', 'Jerry S H Lee', 'Boris A Kashemirov', 'David B Agus', 'Charles E McKenna', 'Daniel Ruderman']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Moving Towards Precision Urologic Oncology: Targeting Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer and Mutated Forms of the Androgen Receptor Using the Novel Inhibitor Darolutamide (ODM-201).', 'In silico discovery of androgen receptor antagonists with activity in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Molecular mechanism of R-bicalutamide switching from androgen receptor antagonist to agonist induced by amino acid mutations using molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculation.', 'An Overview of Next-Generation Androgen Receptor-Targeted Therapeutics in Development for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor: structure, role in prostate cancer and drug discovery.']"""

However, accumulation in nonmalignant tissue such as kidney, bladder, spleen, or liver might limit tumor-to-background contrast for precise lesion delineation, particularly in a surgical setting. To overcome these limitations, a rational linker design aims at the development of a second generation of PSMA-11-based hybrid molecules with an enhanced pharmacokinetic profile and improved imaging contrast. Methods: A selection of rationally designed linkers was introduced to the PSMA-targeting hybrid molecule Glu-urea-Lys-HBED-CC-IRDye800CW, resulting in a second-generation peptidomimetic hybrid molecule library. The biologic properties were investigated in cell-based assays. In a preclinical proof-of-concept study with the radionuclide 68Ga, the impact of the modifications was evaluated by determination of specific tumor uptake, pharmacokinetics, and fluorescence imaging in tumor-bearing mice. Results: The modified hybrid molecules carrying various selected linkers revealed high PSMA-specific binding affinity and effective internalization. The highest tumor-to-background contrast of all modifications investigated was identified for the introduction of a histidine- (H) and glutamic acid (E)-containing linker ((HE)3-linker) between the PSMA-binding motif and the chelator. In comparison to the parental core structure, uptake in nonmalignant tissue was significantly reduced to a minimum, as exemplified by an 11-fold reduced spleen uptake from 38.12 ± 14.62 percentage injected dose (%ID)/g to 3.47 ± 1.39 %ID/g (1 h after injection). The specific tumor uptake of this compound (7.59 ± 0.95 %ID/g, 1 h after injection) was detected to be significantly higher than that of the parental tracer PSMA-11. These findings confirmed by PET and fluorescence imaging are accompanied by an enhanced pharmacokinetic profile with accelerated background clearance at early time points after injection. Conclusion: The novel generation of PSMA-targeting hybrid molecules reveals fast elimination, reduced background organ enrichment, and high PSMA-specific tumor uptake meeting the key demands for potent tracers in nuclear medicine and fluorescence-guided surgery. The approach's efficacy in improving the pharmacokinetic profile highlights the strengths of rational linker design as a powerful tool in strategic hybrid-molecule development.""","""['Ann-Christin Eder', 'Martin Schäfer', 'Jana Schmidt', 'Ulrike Bauder-Wüst', 'Mareike Roscher', 'Karin Leotta', 'Uwe Haberkorn', 'Klaus Kopka', 'Matthias Eder']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['A New Class of PSMA-617-Based Hybrid Molecules for Preoperative Imaging and Intraoperative Fluorescence Navigation of Prostate Cancer.', 'PSMA-11-Derived Dual-Labeled PSMA Inhibitors for Preoperative PET Imaging and Precise Fluorescence-Guided Surgery of Prostate Cancer.', 'Improving the Imaging Contrast of 68Ga-PSMA-11 by Targeted Linker Design: Charged Spacer Moieties Enhance the Pharmacokinetic Properties.', 'Synthesis and Preclinical Characterization of the PSMA-Targeted Hybrid Tracer PSMA-I&F for Nuclear and Fluorescence Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', 'Synthesis and evaluation of a novel urea-based 68Ga-complex for imaging PSMA binding in tumor.', 'Synthesis and preclinical evaluation of novel 99mTc-labeled PSMA ligands for radioguided surgery of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate specific membrane antigen binding radiopharmaceuticals: Current data and new concepts.', 'A New Class of PSMA-617-Based Hybrid Molecules for Preoperative Imaging and Intraoperative Fluorescence Navigation of Prostate Cancer.', 'Radiolabeled PSMA Inhibitors.']"""

However, although multiple genes can be responsible for the same reaction, the KGML-reader KEGGScape only presents the first listed gene in a network node for a given reaction. This can lead to incorrect interpretations of the pathways. Our new method, FunHoP, shows all possible genes in each node, making the pathways more complete. FunHoP collapses all genes in a node into one measurement using read counts from RNA-seq. Assuming that activity for an enzymatic reaction mainly depends upon the gene with the highest number of reads, and weighting the reads on gene length and ratio, a new expression value is calculated for the node as a whole. Differential expression at node level is then applied to the networks. Using prostate cancer as model, we integrate RNA-seq data from two patient cohorts with metabolism data from literature.

This report summarizes the safety data from the overall safety population (OSP) and efficacy data, including additional disease cohorts not published previously.  Patients and methods:   Patients with refractory metastatic epithelial cancers received intravenous SG (8, 10, 12, or 18 mg/kg) on days 1 and 8 of 21-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Endpoints for the OSP included safety and pharmacokinetic parameters with investigator-evaluated objective response rate (ORR per RECIST 1.1), duration of response, clinical benefit rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival evaluated for cohorts (n > 10 patients) of small-cell lung, colorectal, esophageal, endometrial, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and castrate-resistant prostate cancer.  Results:   In the OSP (n = 495, median age 61 years, 68% female; UGT1A1∗28 homozygous, n = 46; 9.3%), 41 (8.3%) permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse events (AEs). Most common treatment-related AEs were nausea (62.6%), diarrhea (56.2%), fatigue (48.3%), alopecia (40.4%), and neutropenia (57.8%). Most common treatment-related serious AEs (n = 75; 15.2%) were febrile neutropenia (4.0%) and diarrhea (2.8%). Grade ≥3 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia occurred in 42.4% and 5.3% of patients, respectively.

There was one treatment-related death due to an AE of aspiration pneumonia. Partial responses were seen in endometrial cancer (4/18, 22.2% ORR) and small-cell lung cancer (11/62, 17.7% ORR), and one castrate-resistant prostate cancer patient had a complete response (n = 1/11; 9.1% ORR).

The maximum standardised uptake value (SUVmax) is a quantification measure of highest radiotracer uptake within PET-avid lesions.  Objective:   To assess the utility of SUVmax in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) on biopsy alone and in combination with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI).  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a retrospective analysis of 200 men who underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, mpMRI, and transperineal template prostate biopsy between 2016 and 2018.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary and secondary outcomes were detection of grade group (GG) 3-5 and GG 2-5 prostate cancer, respectively. We used the Mann-Whitney U test to compare SUVmax by GG, and calculated sensitivity and specificity for csPCa detection via 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, mpMRI, and both. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify predictors of csPCa on biopsy.  Results and limitations:   The median SUVmax was greater for GG 3-5 tumours (6.40, interquartile range [IQR] 4.47-11.0) than for benign and GG 1-2 tumours (3.14, IQR 2.55-3.91; p < 0.001). The median SUVmax was greater for GG 3 (5.70, IQR 3.68-8.67) than for GG 2 (3.47, IQR 2.70-4.74; p < 0.001). For GG 3-5 disease, sensitivity was 86.5%, 95.9%, and 98.6%, and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 88.4%, 88.5%, and 93.3% using SUVmax ≥4, a Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score of 3-5, and both, respectively. This combined model detected more GG 3-5 disease than mpMRI alone (98.6% vs 95.9%; p = 0.04). SUVmax was an independent predictor of csPCa for GG 3-5 disease only (odds ratio 1.27 per unit, 95% confidence interval 1.13-1.45). Our results are limited by the retrospective study design.  Conclusions:   Greater SUVmax on 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT is associated with detection of GG 3-5 cancer on biopsy. The combination of PI-RADS score and SUVmax provides higher sensitivity and NPV than either alone. 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT may be useful alongside mpMRI in improving risk stratification for localised disease.  Patient summary:   The amount of a radioactive tracer taken up in the prostate during a type of scan called PET (positron emission tomography) can predict whether aggressive prostate cancer is likely to be found on biopsy. This may complement the more usual type of scan, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), used to detect prostate cancer.""","""['Arveen A Kalapara', 'Zita E Ballok', 'Shakher Ramdave', ""Richard O'Sullivan"", 'Andrew Ryan', 'Badrinath Konety', 'Jeremy P Grummet', 'Mark Frydenberg']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['The Additive Diagnostic Value of Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography to Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Triage in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer (PRIMARY): A Prospective Multicentre Study.', 'Detection and localisation of primary prostate cancer using 68 gallium prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography compared with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and radical prostatectomy specimen pathology.', 'Protocol for the PRIMARY clinical trial, a prospective, multicentre, cross-sectional study of the additive diagnostic value of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography/computed tomography to multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnostic setting for men being investigated for prostate cancer.', 'Diagnostic Performance of Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography-targeted biopsy for Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'What Is the Negative Predictive Value of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Excluding Prostate Cancer at Biopsy?

Aim:   To determine factors released from PRP and explore their role in mediating preservation of erectile function (EF) in a rat model of CN injury.  Methods:   Male Sprague-Dawley rats (aged 10 weeks) were used in this study. 6 rats were used to obtain blood for PRP and whole plasma preparation. We probed samples using a cytokine antibody array and performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We determined the expression patterns of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CXCL5) and receptors in the major pelvic ganglion (MPG) and corpus cavernosum via immunostaining. 32 rats were divided into 4 groups based on the type of injection received: (i) sham, (ii) vehicle, (iii) 400 μL of PRP, and (iv) 30 ng/kg of CXCL5. Groups 2-4 were subjected to bilateral CN crush (BCNC) injury. 4 weeks later, EF was assessed by CN electrostimulation, and CNs and penile tissue were collected for histological analysis.  Outcome:   Cytokine antibody array, ELISA, erectile response, and immunofluorescence staining readings.  Results:   The PRP contained high levels of CXCL5. MPG neurons expressed CXCL5 and CXCR2. PRP intracavernous injection stabilized CXCR2 and increased CXCL5 expression in the MPG after BCNC, thus enhancing neuroprotection. CXCL5 injection improved BCNC-induced erectile dysfunction by preventing smooth muscle atrophy.  Clinical implications:   The therapeutic efficacy of PRP in CN injury-induced erectile dysfunction may arise from the synergy among multiple biomolecules. Our study serves as a basis for future studies on PRP formulation to provide safe and effective medications for the maintenance of EF after radical prostatectomy in patients with prostate cancer.  Strengths & limitations:   A strength of our study is that our model was able to isolate the role of cytokines, specifically CXCL5, as part of the mechanism responsible for PRP's protective properties. However, the rat cytokine array provided limited experimental targets. The rats used were not at the age corresponding to prostate cancer patients in clinical settings. Our study did not explore CXCL5 blocking in the PRP group. Finally, the main protein quantification results by western blotting were hampered because of small tissue samples.

This paper focused on the functions of miR-4429 in prostate cancer (PCa) progression and the molecules involved.  Methods:   Expression of miR-4429 in PCa tissues and cells was determined. Upregulation of miR-4429 was introduced in PCa cells to examine its role in the malignant behaviors of cells. The putative target mRNA of miR-4429 involved in PCa progression was predicted from a bioinformatic system and validated through luciferase assays. Overexpression of distal-less homeobox 1 (DLX1) was further induced in cells to validate its implication in miR-4429-mediated events. The activity of Wnt/β-catenin pathway was determined.  Results:   miR-4429 was poorly expressed in PCa tissues and cells. Artificial upregulation of miR-4429 significantly reduced proliferation, growth, invasion, migration and resistance to death of cancer cells and inactivated the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. DLX1 mRNA was found as a target of miR-4429.

After the implementation of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, several studies described rising rates globally, but it is possible that indolent lesions are being detected given the lack of changes in mortality data. The Brazilian government recommends against PSA screening in the male population regardless of age, but the Urology Society issued a report recommending that screening should start at 50 years old for certain men and for those aged ≥75 years with a life expectancy exceeding 10 years. In this study, we examined the incidence and mortality rates of invasive prostate cancer over time in the Sergipe state of Brazil. The databases of the Aracaju Cancer Registry and Mortality Information System were used to calculate age-standardized rates for all prostate tumors (International Classification of Diseases 10th edition: C61 and D07.5) in the following age ranges: 20-44, 45-54, and ≥65 years. We identified 3595 cases of cancer, 30 glandular intraepithelial high-grade lesions, and 3269 deaths. Using the Joinpoint Regression Program, we found that the incidence of prostate cancer dramatically increased over time until the mid-2000s for all age groups, after which the rates declined. Prostate cancer mortality rates increased until 2005, followed by a non-significant annual percent change of 22.0 in 2001-2005 and a stable rate thereafter. We noticed that the increases and decreases of the incidence rates of prostate cancer were associated with the screening recommendations. Meanwhile, the increased mortality rates did not appear to be associated with decreased PSA testing; instead, they were linked to the effects of age and improvements in identification of the cause of death. Thus, we do not believe a PSA screening program would benefit the population of this study.""","""['Carlos Anselmo Lima', 'Brenda Evelin Barreto da Silva', 'Evânia Curvelo Hora', 'Marcela Sampaio Lima', 'Erika de Abreu Costa Brito', 'Marceli de Oliveira Santos', 'Angela Maria da Silva', 'Marco Antonio Prado Nunes', 'Hugo Leite de Farias Brito', 'Marcia Maria Macedo Lima']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Trends in prostate cancer incidence and mortality in a mid-sized Northeastern Brazilian city.', 'Trends in cervical cancer and its precursor forms to evaluate screening policies in a mid-sized Northeastern Brazilian city.', 'Trends in prostate cancer incidence and mortality: an analysis of mortality change by screening intensity.', 'Patterns and trends in prostate cancer incidence, survival, prevalence and mortality.

With longer survival rates for cancer patients, CM will be increasingly encountered. We evaluated clinical and ultrasonographic (US) characteristics of CM in order to identify diagnostic biomarkers that correlate with the primary tumor site.  Methods:   The medical records of all patients with CM evaluated at the Ocular Oncology Unit between February 2010 and March 2020 were analyzed.  Results:   82 eyes of 70 patients were included. The primary cancer site was lung in 26 patients (37%), breast in 23 (33%), kidney in 9 (13%), gastrointestinal in 5 (7%), thyroid in 5 (7%), parathyroids and prostate respectively in 2 (3%). Fifty-five patients (78%) had other systemic metastases at the time of ocular diagnosis. Ten (14%) patients had no history of primary cancer. Bilateral CM were found in 20 patients (29%); fifty-six eyes (68%) had a single CM. The epicenter of CM was predominantly macula (43 eyes, 52%). The mean thickness was 4,1 mm (range 1,8-12,3). US structure was inhomogeneous in 67 eyes (82%). Reflectivity was mainly medium (39%) and medium-low (39%). In particular, CM from lung cancer showed lower reflectivity than those from the breast (p = 0,02). CM deriving from lung cancer were typically dome-shaped, whereas CM originating from breast were characteristically plateau shaped (p = 0,02). Seventy-four (91%) eyes presented fluid on optical coherence tomography.  Conclusion:   We significatively found that CM from lung cancer generally appear dome-shaped with medium-low internal reflectivity, whereas those from breast cancer typically present a plateau appearance and higher internal reflectivity. Though it is hard to identify the site of the primary tumor relying exclusively on clinical and US aspects, morphology and internal reflectivity can be considered as diagnostic biomarkers. Thus, the origin of the primary tumor can be suspected by integrating a constellation of findings.""","""['Maria Antonietta Blasi', 'Martina Maceroni', 'Carmela Grazia Caputo', 'Maria Grazia Sammarco', 'Andrea Scupola', 'Jacopo Lenkowicz', 'Giovanni Schinzari', 'Ernesto Rossi', 'Monica Maria Pagliara']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Survey of 520 eyes with uveal metastases.', 'Two- and three-dimensional topographic analysis of pathologically myopic eyes with dome-shaped macula and inferior staphyloma by spectral domain optical coherence tomography.', 'Clinical characteristics of choroidal metastasis.', 'Ultrasonography of metastases and melanomas of the choroid.', 'Carcinoid tumor of the lung.

Methods:   National electronic laboratory and clinical data from the Veterans Health Administration were used to identify patients with CRPC (ie, rising prostate-specific antigen [PSA] on androgen deprivation) who received abiraterone, enzalutamide, docetaxel, or ketoconazole from 2010 through 2017. It was determined whether clinical (eg, PSA) and nonclinical factors (eg, race, facility) were associated with the first-line treatment selection using multilevel, multinomial logistic regression. The average marginal effects (AMEs) were calculated of patient, disease, and facility characteristics on ketoconazole versus more appropriate CRPC therapy.  Results:   There were 4998 patients identified with CRPC who received first-line ketoconazole, docetaxel, abiraterone, or enzalutamide. After adjustment, increasing age was associated with receipt of abiraterone (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.07; 95% credible interval [CrI], 1.06-1.09) or enzalutamide (aOR, 1.10; 95% CrI, 1.08-1.11) versus docetaxel.

At this advanced stage of the disease, there are several therapeutic strategies approved in recent times, being one of them Radium-223 dichloride (Radium-223). However, its mechanisms of action and the process that conducts to cell death are not fully understood. Given this, our main goal is to characterize the radiobiological effects induced by Radium-223 and to evaluate its kinetics on metastatic Prostate Cancer (mPCa) cells.  Materials and methods:   In vitro studies were conducted using two mPCa cell lines, the LNCaP and PC3, the first being derived from lymph node metastasis and the second from bone metastasis. Kinetic studies were conducted to access the capacity of these cell lines to uptake, retain and internalize the Radium-223. For the assessment of radiobiological effects, cells were first exposed to different doses of Radium-223 and the clonogenic assay was done to evaluate cell survival and to determine lethal doses (LD50). Then, the effects were also evaluated in terms of proliferation, oxidative stress, morphological changes and cell damage.  Results:   Radium-223 is uptaken by mPCa cells and reaches the nucleus, where it is retained over time. Irradiation decreases cell survival and proliferation, with LNCaP cells (LD50 = 1.73mGy) being more radiosensitive than PC3 cells (LD50 = 4.20mGy). Irradiated cells showed morphological changes usually associated with apoptosis and a dose-dependent increase in DNA damage. Moreover, activation of cell cycle checkpoints occurs through ATM/CHK2 pathway, which is involved in cell cycle arrest and cell death.  Conclusions:   The cytotoxic and anti-proliferative effects on both cell lines showed that Radium-223 can decrease the aggressiveness of tumor cells by decreasing the cell survival and proliferation and, also, by increasing the DNA damage. The similar results observed in both cell lines indicated that Radium-223 may have the potential to be used as a therapeutic option also for mCRPC patients with lymph node metastasis. The activation of DNA Damage Response pathways allows the possibility to understand the importance of these checkpoints as targets for new combined therapies.""","""['Inês A Marques', 'Ana M Abrantes', 'Ana S Pires', 'Ana R Neves', 'Francisco J Caramelo', 'Tiago Rodrigues', 'Paulo Matafome', 'Edgar Tavares-da-Silva', 'Ana C Gonçalves', 'Cristiana C Pereira', 'João P Teixeira', 'Raquel Seiça', 'Grancinda Costa', 'Arnaldo Figueiredo', 'Maria F Botelho']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Biol""","""['Efficacy of Radium-223 in Bone-metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer with and Without Homologous Repair Gene Defects.', 'Radium-223 for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: A window of opportunity.', 'Radium-223 for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) : The androgen receptor-independent active agent in the therapeutic sequence.', 'Radium-223 in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Clinical Development and Use in Contemporary Practice.', 'Radium-223 and concomitant therapies in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: an international, early access, open-label, single-arm phase 3b trial.', 'Ultrastructural Analysis of Cancer Cells Treated with the Radiopharmaceutical Radium Dichloride (223RaRaCl2): Understanding the Effect on Cell Structure.', 'Differential responses to 223Ra and Alpha-particles exposure in prostate cancer driven by mitotic catastrophe.']"""

In this study, it was aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the surgeon's laparoscopy experience in the perioperative and postoperative results of RALP patients.  Material and method:   Patients who underwent RALP were retrospectively screened. The first 20 cases done by surgeons in both groups and 40 cases in total were included in the study. Surgeons with laparoscopy training were designated as group 1, and surgeons without laparoscopy training were designated as group 2. Patient's age, preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value, prostate biopsy pathology, radical prostatectomy pathology, surgical margin positivity, extracapsular extension, and seminal vesicle invasion status, blood transfusion rate, operation time, length of hospital stay, and 1-year follow-up potency and urinary incontinence rates were compared.  Results:   There was no difference between the two groups in terms of age, preoperative PSA, preoperative biopsy results, blood transfusion rates, operation times, and the length of hospital stay of the patients.

This study aimed to verify expressions of urothelial and prostate lineage markers in the respective carcinomas and to seek the relative importance of these markers in making this distinction. Gene expressions of these markers were downloaded from TCGA Pan-Cancer database for bladder and prostate carcinomas. Differential gene expressions of these markers were analyzed. Standard linear discriminant analyses were applied to establish the relative importance of these markers in lineage determination and to construct the model best in making the distinction. This study shows that all urothelial lineage genes except for the gene for uroplakin III were significantly expressed in bladder urothelial carcinomas (p < 0.001). In descending order of importance to distinguish from prostate adenocarcinomas, genes for uroplakin II, S100P, GATA3 and thrombomodulin had high discriminant loadings (> 0.3).

Using multi-level information published in The Cancer Genome Atlas, we performed eQTL-based analyses on DNA methylation and gene expression. To better interpret these data, we correlated loci and clinical indexes to identify the important loci for both PCa development and progression. Our data demonstrated that although only a small proportion of genes are regulated via DNA methylation in PCa, these genes are enriched in important cancer-related groups. In addition, single nucleotide polymorphism analysis identified the locations of CpG sites and genes within at-risk loci, including the 19q13.2-q13.43 and 16q22.2-q23.1 loci.

In prostate cancer, however, PET-FDG imaging has shown limited clinical applicability, suggesting that prostate cancer cells may utilize hexoses other than glucose, such as fructose, as the preferred energy source. Our previous studies suggested that prostate cancer cells overexpress fructose transporters, but not glucose transporters, compared with benign cells. Here, we focused on validating the functional expression of fructose transporters and determining whether fructose can modulate the biology of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Fructose transporters, Glut5 and Glut9, were significantly upregulated in clinical specimens of prostate cancer when compared with their benign counterparts. Fructose levels in the serum of patients with prostate cancer were significantly higher than healthy subjects. Functional expression of fructose transporters was confirmed in prostate cancer cell lines. A detailed kinetic characterization indicated that Glut5 represents the main functional contributor in mediating fructose transport in prostate cancer cells. Fructose stimulated proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells in vitro. In addition, dietary fructose increased the growth of prostate cancer cell line-derived xenograft tumors and promoted prostate cancer cell proliferation in patient-derived xenografts. Gene set enrichment analysis confirmed that fructose stimulation enriched for proliferation-related pathways in prostate cancer cells. These results demonstrate that fructose promotes prostate cancer cell growth and aggressiveness in vitro and in vivo and may represent an alternative energy source for prostate cancer cells.

Here we demonstrate that ectopic expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor speckle-type poxvirus and zinc finger domain protein (SPOP) stabilizes 17βHSD4. SPOP bound a functional substrate-binding consensus (SBC) motif 315RATST319 in 17βHSD4 and promoted nondegradable K27- and K29-linked polyubiquitination of 17βHSD4. The effect of SPOP was antagonized by serum- and glucocorticoid kinase-3 (SGK3)-mediated phosphorylation of serine 318 (S318) in the SBC and S318 phosphorylation-dependent binding of SKP2 E3 ligase and subsequent K48-linked polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of 17βHSD4. Prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutations impaired the SPOP-17βHSD4 interaction, caused 17βHSD4 protein destruction in prostate cancer cells in culture and patient specimens, and increased testosterone production and prostate cancer cell growth in vitro and in mouse models. Thus, we have identified SPOP and SKP2 as two essential E3 ubiquitin ligases that exert opposite effects on 17βHSD4 protein degradation and intratumoral androgenesis in prostate cancer cells. We further demonstrate that SPOP mutations or SKP2 overexpression contribute to prostate cancer progression by decreasing 17βHSD4 expression and increasing intratumoral androgen synthesis.

A novel vaccine platform using adenovirus 5 (Ad5) vectors [E1-, E2b-] targeting three TAAs-prostate-specific antigen (PSA), brachyury, and MUC-1-has been developed. Both brachyury and the C-terminus of MUC-1 are overexpressed in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and have been shown to play an important role in resistance to chemotherapy, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and metastasis. The transgenes for PSA, brachyury, and MUC-1 all contain epitope modifications for the expression of CD8+ T-cell enhancer agonist epitopes. We report here the first-in-human trial of this vaccine platform.  Methods:   Patients with mCRPC were given concurrently three vaccines targeting PSA, brachyury, and MUC-1 at 5×1011 viral particles (VP) each, subcutaneously every 3 weeks for a maximum of three doses (dose de-escalation cohort), followed by a booster vaccine every 8 weeks for 1 year (dose-expansion cohort only). The primary objective was to determine the safety and the recommended phase II dose. Immune assays and clinical responses were evaluated.  Results:   Eighteen patients with mCRPC were enrolled between July 2018 and September 2019 and received at least one vaccination. Median PSA was 25.58 ng/mL (range, 0.65-1006 ng/mL). The vaccine was tolerable and safe, and no grade >3 treatment-related adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed. One patient had a partial response, while five patients had confirmed PSA decline and five had stable disease for >6 months. Median progression-free survival was 22 weeks (95% CI: 19.1 to 34). Seventeen (100%) of 17 patients mounted T-cell responses to at least one TAA, whereras 8 (47%) of 17 patients mounted immune responses to all three TAAs. Multifunctional T-cell responses to PSA, MUC-1, and brachyury were also detected after vaccination in the majority of the patients.  Conclusions:   Ad5 PSA/MUC-1/brachyury vaccine is well tolerated. The primary end points were met and there were no DLTs. The recommended phase II dose is 5×1011 VP. The vaccine demonstrated clinical activity, including one partial response and confirmed PSA responses in five patients. Three patients with prolonged PSA responses received palliative radiation therapy. Further research is needed to evaluate the clinical benefit and immunogenicity of this vaccine in combination with other immuno-oncology agents and/or palliative radiation therapy.

A 64-year-old man was referred to an urologist with an increased PSA of 6.9ng/mL in December 2008. There were no urinary symptoms. Prostatic biopsies revealed a Gleason 6 adenocarcinoma (3+3), and he was treated with low dose rate brachytherapy in May 2009. Sixty-seven seeds of iodine 125 were loaded under ultrasound control, and the PSA subsequently fell to a nadir of 1.19ng/mL in November 2015. Eight years (May 2017) after the initial treatment, the PSA rose to 5.2ng/mL. Pelvic MRI and choline PET revealed a nodule in the region of the left internal obturator muscle. Nodule biopsies confirmed prostatic origin. This perineal recurrence is thus most likely related to seeding of tumour cells along the track of a brachytherapy needle. To our knowledge, this is only the fourth case of perineal recurrence of prostatic cancer along a low-dose rate brachytherapy needle track.

In 2020, sixty-five thousand new prostate cancer cases were expected in Brazil, and almost 30% of these patients are estimated to be from the northeast region. However, from 75 robotic platforms available in the country, only one is accessible in the state of Ceará since 2015. This study reports the intraoperative, functional, and oncological outcomes of patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer performed by robotic surgeons during a training period supervised by a proctor. We also compared these results with the literature reporting the experience of different Brazilian centers. We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data of 58 initial cases of robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy at a private Brazilian hospital in Fortaleza, Ceará. The surgeries were performed by two robotic surgeons during the training period under proctor supervision. We reported the epidemiological and intraoperative data, complications, pathological report, functional and oncological outcomes. The median operative time was 180 min. None of the patients needed conversion or blood transfusion. The pathology report described 21.81% of positive surgical margins (16.27% of all pT2 and 45.45% of all pT3 patients). The median follow-up was 40 months. Biochemical recurrence occurred in 21.73%, continence in 92%, and potency in 79.54%. No major complications (Clavien grades III-V) were reported. In our experience, robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy performed by surgeons training with proctor's assistance is feasible and safe.

Sensitivity of PCa cells to androgens play a central role in tumor aggressiveness but biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity that follow the progression of the disease has not yet been verified. The vitamin D endocrine system and its receptors, the Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) and the Protein Disulfide-Isomerase A3 (PDIA3), are related to anti-tumoral effects as well as carcinogenesis and have therefore been suggested as potential candidates for the prevention and therapy of several cancer forms, including PCa. In this study, we evaluated the mRNA expression of VDR and PDIA3 involved in vitamin D signaling in cell lines representing different stages of PCa (PNT2, P4E6, LNCaP, DU145 and PC3). This study further aimed to evaluate vitamin D receptors and their isoforms as potential markers for clinical diagnosis of PCa. A novel transcript isoform of PDIA3 (PDIA3N) was identified and found to be expressed in all PCa cell lines analyzed. Androgen-independent cell lines showed a higher mRNA expression ratio between PDIA3N/PDIA3 contrary to androgen-dependent cell lines that showed a lower mRNA expression ratio between PDIA3N/PDIA3. The structure of PDIA3N differed from PDIA3. PDIA3N was found to be a N-truncated isoform of PDIA3 and differences in protein structure suggests an altered protein function i.e. cell location, thioredoxin activity and affinity for 1,25(OH)2D3. Collectively, PDIA3 transcript isoforms, the ratio between PDIA3N/PDIA3 and especially PDIA3N, are proposed as candidate markers for future studies with different stages of PCa progression.""","""['Maria Araceli Diaz Cruz', 'Sandra Karlsson', 'Ferenc Szekeres', 'Maria Faresjö', 'Dan Lund', 'Dennis Larsson']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Mol Biol Rep""","""['Inhibition of CYP27B1 and CYP24 Increases the Anti-proliferative Effects of 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 in LNCaP Cells.', 'Protein disulfide isomerase A3 might be involved in the regulation of 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase via vitamin D equilibrium in primary cortical neurons.', 'Protein-disulfide isomerase-associated 3 (Pdia3) mediates the membrane response to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in osteoblasts.', 'Mechanism of Pdia3-dependent 1α,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 signaling in musculoskeletal cells.', 'New insights on membrane mediated effects of 1α,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 signaling in the musculoskeletal system.', 'Expression and Prognostic Significance of PDIA3 in Cervical Cancer.', 'Protein Disulfide Isomerases Function as the Missing Link Between Diabetes and Cancer.', 'ERp57/PDIA3: new insight.']"""

Therapeutic monitoring of these pharmaceuticals is performed either by measuring PSA levels in serum or by imaging. PET using PSMA ligands labeled with Fluor-18 or Gallium-68 is the most sensitive and specific imaging modality for detection of metastases in advanced prostate cancer. To date, it remains unclear how PSMA expression is modulated by anti-hormonal treatment and how it correlates with PSA secretion.  Methods:   We analyzed modulation of PSMA-mRNA and protein expression, 68Ga-PSMA uptake and regulation of PSA secretion by abiraterone or VPC-13566 in LNCaP cells in vitro.  Results:   We found that abiraterone and VPC-13566 upregulate PSMA protein and mRNA expression but block PSA secretion in LNCaP cells. Both anti-androgens also enhanced 68Ga-PSMA uptake normalized by the number of cells, whereas abiraterone and VPC-13566 reduced 68Ga-PSMA uptake in total LNCaP monolayers treated due to cell death.  Conclusion:   Our data indicate that PSA secretion and PSMA expression are differentially regulated upon anti-androgen treatment.

MicroRNAs (miRNA) appear to be involved in the development and progression of PCa. A diagnostic differentiation from benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) is often only possible through transrectal punch biopsy. This procedure is described as painful and carries risks. It was investigated whether urinary miRNAs can be used as biomarkers to differentiate the prostate diseases above. Therefore urine samples from urological patients with BPH (25) or PCa (28) were analysed using Next-Generation Sequencing to detect the expression profile of total and exosomal miRNA/piRNA. 79 miRNAs and 5 piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) were significantly differentially expressed (adjusted p-value < 0.05 and log2-Fc > 1 or < -1). Of these, 6 miRNAs and 2 piRNAs could be statistically validated (AUC on test cohort > = 0.7). In addition, machine-learning algorithms were used to identify a panel of 22 additional miRNAs, whose interaction makes it possible to differentiate the groups as well. There are promising individual candidates for potential use as biomarkers in prostate cancer. The innovative approach of applying machine learning methods to this kind of data could lead to further small RNAs coming into scientific focus, which have so far been neglected.""","""['Lukas Markert', 'Jonas Holdmann', 'Claudia Klinger', 'Michael Kaufmann', 'Karin Schork', 'Michael Turewicz', 'Martin Eisenacher', 'Andreas Savelsbergh']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Candidate diagnostic miRNAs that can detect cancer in prostate biopsy.', 'Semen miRNAs Contained in Exosomes as Non-Invasive Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'MiR-145 detection in urinary extracellular vesicles increase diagnostic efficiency of prostate cancer based on hydrostatic filtration dialysis method.', 'Exosomal microRNAs as liquid biopsy biomarkers in prostate cancer.', 'miRNAs as biomarkers in prostate cancer.', 'Urinary MicroRNAs as Biomarkers of Urological Cancers: A Systematic Review.', 'Prostate Cancer-Associated miRNAs in Saliva: First Steps to an Easily Accessible and Reliable Screening Tool.', 'Overview of MicroRNAs as Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarkers for High-Incidence Cancers in 2021.', 'Urinary microRNAs and Their Significance in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: A 5-Year Update.', 'Improving the Diagnostic Potential of Extracellular miRNAs Coupled to Multiomics Data by Exploiting the Power of Artificial Intelligence.']"""

In this work, we implement a fully convolutional neural network (CNN) for ultrasound displacement estimation. We present a novel method for generating ultrasound training data, in which synthetic 3-D displacement volumes with a combination of randomly seeded ellipsoids are created and used to displace scatterers, from which simulated ultrasonic imaging is performed using Field II. Network performance was tested on these virtual displacement volumes, as well as an experimental ARFI phantom data set and a human in vivo prostate ARFI data set. In the simulated data, the proposed neural network performed comparably to Loupas's algorithm, a conventional phase-based displacement estimation algorithm; the rms error was [Formula: see text] for the CNN and 0.73 [Formula: see text] for Loupas. Similarly, in the phantom data, the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of a stiff inclusion was 2.27 for the CNN-estimated image and 2.21 for the Loupas-estimated image. Applying the trained network to in vivo data enabled the visualization of prostate cancer and prostate anatomy. The proposed training method provided 26 000 training cases, which allowed robust network training. The CNN had a computation time that was comparable to Loupas's algorithm; further refinements to the network architecture may provide an improvement in the computation time. We conclude that deep neural network-based displacement estimation from ultrasonic data is feasible, providing comparable performance with respect to both accuracy and speed compared to current standard time-delay estimation approaches.""","""['Derek Y Chan', 'D Cody Morris', 'Thomas J Polascik', 'Mark L Palmeri', 'Kathryn R Nightingale']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control""","""['Bi-Directional Semi-Supervised Training of Convolutional Neural Networks for Ultrasound Elastography Displacement Estimation.', 'Convolutional Neural Network-Based Speckle Tracking for Ultrasound Strain Elastography: An Unsupervised Learning Approach.', 'Unsupervised Convolutional Neural Network for Motion Estimation in Ultrasound Elastography.', 'Detection and Localization of Ultrasound Scatterers Using Convolutional Neural Networks.', 'Displacement Estimation in Ultrasound Elastography Using Pyramidal Convolutional Neural Network.', 'Imaging of Single Transducer-Harmonic Motion Imaging-Derived Displacements at Several Oscillation Frequencies Simultaneously.']"""

BMETS was developed at a tertiary-care, academic medical center, but its validity and stability when applied to external data sets are unknown.  Patients and methods:   Patients treated with palliative radiation therapy for SBM from May 2013 to May 2016 at two hospital-based community radiation oncology clinics were included, and medical records were retrospectively reviewed to collect model covariates and survival time. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate overall survival from consultation to death or last follow-up. Model discrimination was estimated using time-dependent area under the curve (tAUC), which was calculated using survival predictions from BMETS based on the initial training data set.  Results:   A total of 216 sites of SBM were treated in 182 patients. Most common histologies were breast (27%), lung (23%), and prostate (23%). Compared with the BMETS training set, the external validation population was older (mean age, 67 v 62 years; P < .001), had more primary breast (27% v 19%; P = .03) and prostate cancer (20% v 12%; P = .01), and survived longer (median, 10.7 v 6.4 months). When the BMETS model was applied to the external data set, tAUC values at 3, 6, and 12 months were 0.82, 0.77, and 0.77, respectively. When refit with data from the combined training and external validation sets, tAUC remained > 0.79.

We sought to automatically detect aggressive cancer (Gleason pattern ≥ 4) and indolent cancer (Gleason pattern 3) on a per-pixel basis on MRI to facilitate the targeting of aggressive cancer during biopsy.  Methods:   We created the Stanford Prostate Cancer Network (SPCNet), a convolutional neural network model, trained to distinguish between aggressive cancer, indolent cancer, and normal tissue on MRI. Ground truth cancer labels were obtained by registering MRI with whole-mount digital histopathology images from patients who underwent radical prostatectomy. Before registration, these histopathology images were automatically annotated to show Gleason patterns on a per-pixel basis. The model was trained on data from 78 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy and 24 patients without prostate cancer. The model was evaluated on a pixel and lesion level in 322 patients, including six patients with normal MRI and no cancer, 23 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy, and 293 patients who underwent biopsy. Moreover, we assessed the ability of our model to detect clinically significant cancer (lesions with an aggressive component) and compared it to the performance of radiologists.  Results:   Our model detected clinically significant lesions with an area under the receiver operator characteristics curve of 0.75 for radical prostatectomy patients and 0.80 for biopsy patients. Moreover, the model detected up to 18% of lesions missed by radiologists, and overall had a sensitivity and specificity that approached that of radiologists in detecting clinically significant cancer.  Conclusions:   Our SPCNet model accurately detected aggressive prostate cancer. Its performance approached that of radiologists, and it helped identify lesions otherwise missed by radiologists.

However, the mechanism underlying its frequent recurrence remains unclear. Studies have demonstrated that spindle and kinetochore associated complex subunit 3 (SKA3) is highly expressed in colorectal and prostate cancer. The present study aimed to determine whether SKA3 could be a predictive and prognostic marker for liver cancer. SKA3 expression levels in liver cancer cell lines, liver cancer tissues, normal liver cells and non‑cancerous tissues were compared at both transcriptional and translational levels. Correlation between SKA3 levels, clinicopathological characteristics and patient survival was also assessed. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to identify SKA3‑associated pathways. Furthermore, SKA3 was knocked down and overexpressed in liver cancer cells, and then assessed the effect on cell proliferation, cell cycle, and tumor formation ability. Kaplan‑Meier survival analysis and log‑rank test were used to evaluate the association between SKA3 expression levels and prognosis. SKA3 mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly higher in liver cancer cell lines and clinical samples, compared with normal controls. Immunohistochemical analysis of 110 patients revealed that upregulation of SKA3 correlated with clinical pathological characteristics and patient survival. GSEA showed that BENPORATH_PROLIFERATION gene set signaling pathways were correlated with SKA3 expression levels.

Advanced PCa is resistant to conventional therapies and high recurrence has been associated with high rates of metastasis. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been proposed to be responsible for this, due to their ability of self‑renewal and differentiation into other cell types. Zinc finger E‑box‑binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), a transcription factor involved in the regulation of epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT), has been associated with the activation of several mechanisms that lead to resistance to treatment. As recent evidence has shown that CSCs may originate from non‑CSCs during EMT, it was hypothesized that knocking down ZEB1 expression in PCa cell lines could revert some properties associated with CSCs. Using lentiviraltransduction, ZEB1 expression was silenced in the PCa DU145 and LNCaP cell lines. The mRNA and protein expression levels of key canonical CSC markers (Krüppel‑like factor 4, SOX2, CD44 and CD133) were determined using reverse transcription‑-quantitative PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. In addition, the colony forming ability of the ZEB1‑knockdown cells was evaluated, and the type of colonies formed (holoclones, paraclones and meroclones) was also characterized. Finally, the ability to form prostatospheres was evaluated in vitro. It was found that in ZEB1‑knockdown DU145 cells, the expression levels of CSC phenotype markers (CD44, CD133 and SOX2) were decreased compared with those in the control group. Furthermore, ZEB1‑knockdown cells exhibited a lower ability to form prostatospheres and to generate colonies. In conclusion, stable silencing of ZEB1 reversed CSC properties in PCa cell lines. Since ZEB1 is associated with malignancy, therapy resistance and a CSC phenotype in PCa cell lines, targeting ZEB1 may be a key factor to eradicate CSCs and improve the prognosis of patients with advanced PCa.""","""['Gisella Pérez#', 'Fernanda López-Moncada#', 'Sebastián Indo', 'María José Torres', 'Enrique A Castellón', 'Héctor R Contreras']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['The role of epithelial-mesenchymal transition drivers ZEB1 and ZEB2 in mediating docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Reduced DAPK1 Expression Promotes Stem Cell-Like Characteristics of Prostate Cancer Cells by Activating ZEB1 via Hippo/YAP Signaling Pathway.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal transition transcription factor ZEB1/ZEB2 co-expression predicts poor prognosis and maintains tumor-initiating properties in head and neck cancer.', 'The Transcription Factors Zeb1 and Snail Induce Cell Malignancy and Cancer Stem Cell Phenotype in Prostate Cells, Increasing Androgen Synthesis Capacity and Therapy Resistance.', 'Role of ZEB Family Members in Proliferation, Metastasis, and Chemoresistance of Prostate Cancer Cells: Revealing Signaling Networks.', 'Anoikis in phenotypic reprogramming of the prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'Role of O-GlcNAcylation on cancer stem cells: Connecting nutrient sensing to cell plasticity.', 'Regulation of the Cancer Stem Phenotype by Long Non-Coding RNAs.', 'Molecular Landscape of LncRNAs in Prostate Cancer: A focus on pathways and therapeutic targets for intervention.', 'SPARC Induces E-Cadherin Repression and Enhances Cell Migration through Integrin αvβ3 and the Transcription Factor ZEB1 in Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

Thus, this work compared the in vitro cytotoxic activity and in vivo side effects of cisplatin (CP) with those of CP-loaded green silver nanoparticles (CP-AgNPs). The cytotoxic activity of CP, green AgNPs, and CP-AgNPs against PC-3, a human prostate cancer cell line, was assessed using MTT assay. CP-AgNPs had a superior cytotoxic effect on PC-3 cells with a 50% inhibition of viability (IC50) of 27.05 μg/mL, followed by CP with an IC50 of 57.64 μg/mL and AgNPs with an IC50 125.4 μg/mL. To evaluate in vivo side effects, 40 male adult Wistar rats were assigned into four groups and intraperitoneally injected with normal saline (control), CP (2.5 mg/kg body weight), green AgNPs (0.1 mL/kg body weight), and CP-AgNPs (2.5 mg/kg body weight). Intraperitoneal CP injection caused a substantial reduction in erythrocyte and leukocyte counts and hemoglobin concentration and a marked increase in urea and creatinine levels and disturbed the renal oxidant/antioxidant status. Furthermore, it caused noticeable structural alterations and significant upregulation of renal Bax and caspase-3 mRNA along with a significant downregulation of B-cell lymphoma 2 mRNA expressions. The loading of CP on green AgNPs significantly relieved the CP-induced pathological alterations and considerably enhanced its therapeutic effectiveness on PC-3 cells.

Methods:   In this single-center study, 200 consecutive patients (100 in each arm) with either enema or catheter preparation were retrospectively included. Two blinded readers independently assessed aspects of image quality on 5-point Likert scales. Scores were compared between groups and the influence of confounding factors evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. Prostate diameters were compared on DWI and T2-weighted imaging using intraclass correlation coefficients.  Results:   Image quality was significantly higher in the enema group regarding the severity of susceptibility-related artifacts (reader 1: 0.34 ± 0.77 vs. 1.73 ± 1.34, reader 2: 0.38 ± 0.86 vs. 1.76 ± 1.39), the differentiability of the anatomy (reader 1: 3.36 ± 1.05 vs. 2.08 ± 1.31, reader 2: 3.37 ± 1.05 vs. 2.09 ± 1.35), and the overall image quality (reader 1: 3.66 ± 0.77 vs. 2.26 ± 1.33, Reader 2: 3.59 ± 0.87 vs. 2.23 ± 1.38) with almost perfect inter-observer agreement (κ = 0.92-0.95). In the enema group, rectal distention was significantly lower and strongly correlated with the severity of artifacts (reader 1: ρ = 0.79, reader 2: ρ = 0.73). Furthermore, there were significantly fewer substantial image distortions, with odds ratios of 0.051 and 0.084 for the two readers which coincided with a higher agreement of the prostate diameters in the phase-encoding direction (0.96 vs. 0.89).

Here, we report that lncRNA PCA3 plays a role in prostate cancer progression that is mediated by nucleoplasmic lamins. PCA3 interacts with the C-terminal region of lamina-associated polypeptide (LAP) 2α. The C-terminal region of LAP2α includes tumor suppressor protein retinoblastoma (pRb)- and lamin-binding domains, and it is necessary for the regulation and stabilization of the nucleoplasmic pool of lamin A. PCA3 inhibits the interaction of LAP2α with lamin A through binding with the C-terminus of LAP2α. The level of nucleoplasmic lamin A/C is increased by knockdown of PCA3. Together, the level of LAP2α within the nucleus is increased by PCA3 knockdown. In PCA3 knockdown cells, the levels of HP1γ, trimethylation of Lys9 on histone H3 (H3K9me3), and trimethylation of Lys36 on histone H3 (H3K36me3) are upregulated. In contrast, trimethylation of Lys4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3) is downregulated. We further demonstrate that activation of the p53 signaling pathway and cell cycle arrest are promoted in the absence of PCA3. These findings support a unique mechanism in which prostate cancer-specific lncRNA controls chromatin organization via regulation of the nucleoplasmic pool of lamins.

Instability of the DNA methylome is well established as a major hallmark of PCa development and progression. Therefore, investigating the dynamics of the methylation changes going from the castration sensitive to the tNEPC state would provide insights into novel mechanisms of resistance. Using an established xenograft model of CRPC, genome-wide methylation analysis was performed on cell lines representing various stages of PCa progression. We confirmed extensive methylation changes with the development of CRPC and tNEPC using this model. This included key genes and pathways associated with cellular differentiation and neurodevelopment. Combined analysis of methylation and gene expression changes further highlighted genes that could potentially serve as therapeutic targets. Furthermore, tNEPC-related methylation signals from this model were detectable in circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) from mCRPC patients undergoing androgen-targeting therapies and were associated with a faster time to clinical progression.

Stomatin inhibited Akt activation, which is mediated by phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDPK1). PDPK1 protein stability was maintained by its binding to HSP90. Stomatin interacted with PDPK1 and interfered with the PDPK1-HSP90 complex formation, resulting in decreased PDPK1 expression. Knockdown of stomatin in cancer cells elevated Akt activation and promoted cell increase by promoting the interaction between PDPK1 and HSP90.

The test is performed on prostate tissue collected during biopsy. There is a lack of data on the association between the GPS and tumor pathology after radical prostatectomy (RP).  Objective:   To investigate the association between GPS and final pathology, including extraprostatic extension (EPE), positive surgical margin (PSM), and seminal vesicle invasion (SVI).  Design, setting, and participants:   Data for the 749 patients who underwent Oncotype DX assay and RP at a referral prostate cancer center between 2015 and 2019 were retrospectively assessed to evaluate the association between GPS and unfavorable pathology parameters.  Intervention:   After a GPS genetic test, patients underwent robotic RP performed by the same surgeon.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association between GPS and EPE, PSM, and SVI. The models were adjusted for age, clinical stage, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, Gleason score, and time between the genomic assay and surgery. The median time between Oncotype DX assay and surgery was 176 d (interquartile range [IQR] 141-226). The median age was 63 yr (IQR 58-68), median GPS was 29 (IQR 21-39), and median PSA was 5.7 ng/ml (IQR 4.6-7.7). In multivariable analyses assessing the odds ratio (OR) per 20-point change in GPS, GPS was an independent predictor of EPE (OR 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-2.3) and SVI (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.4). In addition, when patients were grouped by GPS quartile, the percentage of cases with EPE and SVI increased with the GPS quartile.  Conclusions:   We provide evidence that the Oncotype DX GPS is significantly associated with adverse pathology after RP. Specifically, the risk of EPE and SVI increases with the GPS. Therefore, use of the Oncotype DX GPS may help clinicians to improve preoperative patient counseling and develop surgical strategies for patients with a higher chance of EPE or unfavorable pathological features.  Patient summary:   We studied whether the score for a prostate genetic test was associated with prostate cancer pathology findings for patients who had their prostate removed. We found that the risk of prostate cancer spread outside the gland and to the seminal vesicle increases with higher test scores.

However, an extended analysis of those methods in order to confirm their validity is still needed.  Methods:   We assessed the validity of one of the most frequently used methods to estimate cancer incidence, on the basis of cancer mortality data and the incidence-to-mortality ratio (IMR), the IMR method. Using the previous 15-year cancer mortality time series, we derived the expected yearly number of cancer cases in the period 2004-2013 for six cancer sites for each sex. Generalized linear mixed models, including a polynomial function for the year of death and smoothing splines for age, were adjusted. Models were fitted under a Bayesian framework based on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The IMR method was applied to five scenarios reflecting different assumptions regarding the behavior of the IMR. We compared incident cases estimated with the IMR method to observed cases diagnosed in 2004-2013 in Granada. A goodness-of-fit (GOF) indicator was formulated to determine the best estimation scenario.  Results:   A total of 39,848 cancer incidence cases and 43,884 deaths due to cancer were included. The relative differences between the observed and predicted numbers of cancer cases were less than 10% for most cancer sites. The constant assumption for the IMR trend provided the best GOF for colon, rectal, lung, bladder, and stomach cancers in men and colon, rectum, breast, and corpus uteri in women. The linear assumption was better for lung and ovarian cancers in women and prostate cancer in men. In the best scenario, the mean absolute percentage error was 6% in men and 4% in women for overall cancer. Female breast cancer and prostate cancer obtained the worst GOF results in all scenarios.  Conclusion:   A comparison with a historical time series of real data in a population-based cancer registry indicated that the IMR method is a valid tool for the estimation of cancer incidence. The goodness-of-fit indicator proposed can help select the best assumption for the IMR based on a statistical argument.""","""['Daniel Redondo-Sánchez', 'Miguel Rodríguez-Barranco', 'Alberto Ameijide', 'Francisco Javier Alonso', 'Pablo Fernández-Navarro', 'Jose Juan Jiménez-Moleón', 'María-José Sánchez']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Popul Health Metr""","""['Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Italian cancer figures, report 2014: Prevalence and cure of cancer in Italy.', 'Italian cancer figures, report 2013: Multiple tumours.', 'Epidemiology of cancer among Hispanics in the United States.', 'Sutureless Aortic Valve Replacement for Treatment of Severe Aortic Stenosis: A Single Technology Assessment of Perceval Sutureless Aortic Valve Internet.', 'Exploring Cancer Incidence, Risk Factors, and Mortality in the Lleida Region: Interactive, Open-source R Shiny Application for Cancer Data Analysis.']"""

Androgen receptor (AR) has been a target of PCa treatment for nearly six decades. AR antagonists/degraders can effectively treat PCa caused by increased AR overexpression. However, all approved AR antagonists have similar chemical structures and exhibit the same mode of action on the protein. Although initially effective, resistance to these AR antagonists usually develops. Therefore, this calls for the identification of novel chemical structures of AR antagonists to overcome the resistance. Herein, we employed the synergetic combination of virtual and experimental screening to identify a flavonoid compound which not only effectively inhibits AR transcriptional activity, but also induces the degradation of the protein. Based on this compound, we designed and synthesized a series of derivatives. We discovered that the most potent compound 10e could effectively inhibit AR transcriptional activity, and possessed a profound ability to cause degradation of both full length- and ARv7 truncated forms of human AR.

However, clinical translation of PA imaging remains a challenge due to the limited viewing angles and imaging depth. Described here is a new robust algorithm called Superiorized Photo-Acoustic Non-NEgative Reconstruction (SPANNER), designed to reconstruct PA images in real-time and to address the artifacts associated with limited viewing angles and imaging depth. The method utilizes precise forward modeling of the PA propagation and reception of signals while accounting for the effects of acoustic absorption, element size, shape, and sensitivity, as well as the transducer's impulse response and directivity pattern. A fast superiorized conjugate gradient algorithm is used for inversion. SPANNER is compared to three reconstruction algorithms: delay-and-sum (DAS), universal back-projection (UBP), and model-based reconstruction (MBR). All four algorithms are applied to both simulations and experimental data acquired from tissue-mimicking phantoms, ex vivo tissue samples, and in vivo imaging of the prostates in patients. Simulations and phantom experiments highlight the ability of SPANNER to improve contrast to background ratio by up to 20 dB compared to all other algorithms, as well as a 3-fold increase in axial resolution compared to DAS and UBP. Applying SPANNER on contrast-enhanced PA images acquired from prostate cancer patients yielded a statistically significant difference before and after contrast agent administration, while the other three image reconstruction methods did not, thus highlighting SPANNER's performance in differentiating intrinsic from extrinsic PA signals and its ability to quantify PA signals from the contrast agent more accurately.""","""['Idan Steinberg', 'Jeesu Kim', 'Martin K Schneider', 'Dongwoon Hyun', 'Aimen Zlitni', 'Sarah M Hopper', 'Tal Klap', 'Geoffrey A Sonn', 'Jeremy J Dahl', 'Chulhong Kim', 'Sanjiv Sam Gambhir']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Med Imaging""","""['Speed-of-sound compensated photoacoustic tomography for accurate imaging.', 'Optimized Reconstruction Procedure of Photoacoustic Imaging for Reflection Artifacts Reduction.', 'Photoacoustic imaging with deconvolution algorithm.', 'Multidomain computational modeling of photoacoustic imaging: verification, validation, and image quality prediction.', 'Review on photoacoustic tomographic image reconstruction for acoustically heterogeneous tissues.', 'Functional photoacoustic imaging: from nano- and micro- to macro-scale.', 'Retinal Disease Detection Using Deep Learning Techniques: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Switchable preamplifier for dual modal photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging.', 'A jointed feature fusion framework for photoacoustic image reconstruction.', 'Image Quality Improvement Techniques and Assessment Adequacy in Clinical Optoacoustic Imaging: A Systematic Review.']"""

We describe the completeness of prostate cancer survivorship care plans and evaluate the concordance of follow-up recommendations with guidelines.  Methods:   We analyzed 119 prostate cancer survivorship care plans from one academic and one community cancer center, abstracting demographics, cancer/treatment details, and follow-up recommendations. Follow-up recommendations were compared with the American Cancer Society (ACS), American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines.  Results:   Content in >90% of plans included cancer TNM stage; prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at diagnosis; radiation treatment details (98% of men received radiation); and PSA monitoring recommendations. Potential treatment-specific side effects were listed for 82% of men who had surgery, 86% who received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), and 97% who underwent radiation. The presence of posttreatment symptoms was noted in 71% of plans. Regarding surveillance follow-up, all guidelines recommend an annual digital rectal exam (DRE). No plans specified DRE. However, all 71 plans at the community site recommended at least annual follow-up visits with urology, radiation oncology, and primary care. Only 2/48 plans at the academic site specified follow-up visits. All guidelines recommend PSA testing every 6-12 months for 5 years, then annually. For the first 5 years, 90% of plans were guideline-concordant, 8% suggested oversurveillance, and 2% were incomplete. In men receiving ADT, ACS and ASCO recommend bone density imaging and NCCN recommends testosterone levels. Of 77 men on ADT, 1% were recommended bone density imaging and 16% testosterone level testing.  Conclusions:   While care plan content is more complete for demographic and treatment summary information, both sites had gaps in reporting posttreatment symptoms and ADT-related testing recommendations.

Therefore, we sought to evaluate clinical effects of neoadjuvant indomethacin (Indo), which inhibits the steroidogenic enzyme AKR1C3, in addition to combinatorial anti-androgen blockade, in men with high-risk PC undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP).  Methods:   This was an open label, single-site, Phase II neoadjuvant trial in men with high to very-high-risk PC, as defined by NCCN criteria. Patients received 12 weeks of apalutamide (Apa), abiraterone acetate plus prednisone (AAP), degarelix, and Indo followed by RP. Primary objective was to determine the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate. Secondary objectives included minimal residual disease (MRD) rate, defined as residual cancer burden (RCB) ≤ 0.25cm3 (tumor volume multiplied by tumor cellularity) and elucidation of molecular features of resistance.  Results:   Twenty patients were evaluable for the primary endpoint. Baseline median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 10.1 ng/ml, 4 (20%) patients had Gleason grade group (GG) 4 disease and 16 had GG 5 disease. At RP, 1 (5%) patient had pCR and 6 (30%) had MRD. Therapy was well tolerated. Over a median follow-up of 23.8 months, 1 of 7 (14%) men with pathologic response and 6 of 13 (46%) men without pathologic response had a PSA relapse. There was no association between prostate hormone levels or HSD3B1 genotype with pathologic response.

Objective:   To assess the prevalence of missing data and its association with overall survival among patients with cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   In this retrospective cohort study, all variables within the National Cancer Database were reviewed for missing or unknown values for patients with the 3 most common cancers in the US who received diagnoses from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2015. The prevalence of patient records with missing data and the association with overall survival were assessed. Data analysis was performed from February to August 2020.  Exposures:   Any missing data field within a patient record among 63 variables of interest from more than 130 total variables in the National Cancer Database.  Main outcomes and measures:   Prevalence of missing data in the medical records of patients with cancer and associated 2-year overall survival.  Results:   A total of 1 198 749 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (mean [SD] age, 68.5 [10.9] years; 628 811 men [52.5%]), 2 120 775 patients with breast cancer (mean [SD] age, 61.0 [13.3] years; 2 101 758 women [99.1%]), and 1 158 635 patients with prostate cancer (mean [SD] age, 65.2 [9.0] years; 100% men) were included in the analysis. Among those with non-small cell lung cancer, 851 295 patients (71.0%) were missing data for variables of interest; 2-year overall survival was 33.2% for patients with missing data and 51.6% for patients with complete data (P < .001). Among those with breast cancer, 1 161 096 patients (54.7%) were missing data for variables of interest; 2-year overall survival was 93.2% for patients with missing data and 93.9% for patients with complete data (P < .001). Among those with prostate cancer, 460 167 patients (39.7%) were missing data for variables of interest; 2-year overall survival was 91.0% for patients with missing data and 95.6% for patients with complete data (P < .001).  Conclusions and relevance:   This study found that within a large cancer registry-based real-world data source, there was a high prevalence of missing data that were unable to be ascertained from the medical record. The prevalence of missing data among patients with cancer was associated with heterogeneous differences in overall survival.

Methods:   We selected from our database, composed of 620 biopsies, only men on AS according to criteria of John Hopkins Protocol (T1c, < 3 positive cores, GS = 3+3 = 6). Monitoring consisted of PSA measurement every 3 months, a clinical examination every 6 months, confirmatory FB within 6 months and then annual FB in all men.

FB were performed with a transrectal elastic free-hand fusion platform. The overall and clinically significant cancer detection rate was reported. Secondary, the diagnostic role of systematic biopsies was evaluated.  Results:   We selected 56 patients on AS with mean age 67.4 years, mean PSA 6.7 ng/ml and at least one follow-up MRI-US fusion biopsy (10 had 2 or 3 follow-up biopsies). Lesions detected by MRI were: PIRADS-2 in 5, PIRADS-3 in 28, PIRADS-4 in 18 pts and PIRADS-5 in 5 patients.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography ([68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET-CTPSMA PET-CT) has shown good potential in this field. The aim is to evaluate PSMA PET-CT detection rate in PCa BCR and assess its impact on clinical outcome.  Material and methods:   Out of 319 patients with PCa who underwent PSMA PET-CT between October 2015 and June 2019, 70 had developed BCR after treatment with curative intent. Two groups were created: one with BCR after surgery (RP group) (N: 48; 68.6%) and other with BCR after radiotherapy (RT group) (N: 22; 31.4%). Clinical, analytical, pathological and PSMA PET-CT results were evaluated.  Results:   Initial age was different between groups (p = 0.008). RP patients were mainly at intermediate risk (85.1% vs 42.9%, p = 0.001) while RT patients were at low risk of recurrence (8.5% vs 47.6%, p = 0.001). In RP and RT groups, PSMA PETCT detected, respectively, pelvic relapse in 31.3% and 63.6%, and extrapelvic relapse in 18.8% and 31.8%. Salvage treatment was performed in 61.9% (n = 26) of RP patients and in 15% (n = 3) of RT patients, p < 0.001. Of RP patients submitted to salvage treatment, 59.1% achieved complete remission. Concerning these patients, local radiotherapy led to complete remission in 68.4% (n = 13). Of RT patients submitted to salvage treatment, two had complete remission and one had partial remission.Concerning detection rate, PSMA PET-CT was positive for pelvic relapse when pre-PET PSA ≥ 0.8 ng/mL (RP) or ≥ 2.3 ng/mL (RT) and for extrapelvic relapse when PSA ≥ 0.4 ng/mL (RP) or ≥ 3.5 ng/mL (RT), p > 0.05.  Conclusions:   Biochemical persistence rate after salvage therapy was similar (30-40%).

In this study, we investigated molecular imaging and biochemical responses after a single cycle of [225Ac]Ac-PSMA-617/[177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 tandem therapy in patients who had progressed on [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 monotherapy. Methods: Seventeen patients with mCRPC were included in a retrospective, monocenter study. Molecular imaging-based response was assessed by modified PERCIST criteria using the whole-body total lesion PSMA (TLP) and molecular tumour volume (MTV) derived from [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT. Biochemical response was evaluated according to PCWG3 criteria using the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) serum value. Concordance and correlation statistics as well as survival analyses were performed. Results: Based on the molecular imaging-based response assessment, 5 (29.4%) patients showed partial remission and 7 (41.2%) had stable disease. The remaining 5 (29.4%) patients had further progression, four with an increase in TLP/MTV of >30% and one with stable TLP/MTV but appearance of new metastases. Based on the biochemical response assessment, 5 (29.4%), 8 (47.1%), and 4 (23.5%) patients showed partial remission, stable disease, and progressive disease, respectively. A comparison of the response assessment methods showed a concordance of 100% (17/17) between TLP and MTV and 70.6% (12/17) between TLP/MTV and PSA. Patients with partial remission, independently assessed by each method, had better overall survival (OS) than patients with either stable or progressive disease. The difference in OS was statistically significant for the molecular imaging response assessment (median OS not reached vs. 8.3 m, p = 0.044), but not for the biochemical response assessment (median OS 18.1 m vs. 9.4 m, p = 0.468). Conclusion: Based on both assessment methods, [225Ac]Ac-PSMA-617/[177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 tandem therapy is an effective treatment for the highly challenging cohort of patients with mCRPC who have progressed on [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 monotherapy.

Histone modification is a vital mechanism of gene expression and a promising therapy target. In this study, we characterized WD repeat domain 5 (WDR5), a regulator of histone modification, and explored its potential therapeutic value in PCa. Experimental Design: We characterized specific regulators of histone modification, based on TCGA data. The expression and clinical features of WDR5 were analyzed in two dependent cohorts. The functional role of WDR5 was further investigated with siRNA and OICR-9429, a small molecular antagonist of WDR5, in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism of WDR5 was explored by RNA-sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Results: WDR5 was overexpressed in PCa and associated with advanced clinicopathological features, and predicted poor prognosis. Both inhibition of WDR5 by siRNA and OICR-9429 could reduce proliferation, and increase apoptosis and chemosensitivity to cisplatin in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, targeting WDR5 by siRNA and OICR-9429 could block IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 expression in PCa cells. Mechanistically, we clarified that some cell cycle, anti-apoptosis, DNA repair and immune related genes, including AURKA, CCNB1, E2F1, PLK1, BIRC5, XRCC2 and PD-L1, were directly regulated by WDR5 and OICR-9429 in H3K4me3 and c-Myc dependent manner. Conclusions: These data revealed that targeting WDR5 suppressed proliferation, enhanced apoptosis, chemosensitivity to cisplatin and immunotherapy in PCa.

In this study, we aimed at exploring the potential functions of CASC11 in association with miR-145 and IGF1R during the malignant progression of PCa cells.  Methods:   We initially investigated the oncogenic potential of noncoding members of CASC gene family and analyzed the effects of CASC11 overexpression on proliferation, migration, and colony formation ability of DU145, LNCaP, and PC3 PCa cells.

Results:   In silico analysis revealed that of the CASC family only CASC11 showed consistent results considering its differential expression as well as its association with the overall survival of patients. We demonstrated that ectopic overexpression of CASC11 significantly increased the proliferation, colony formation, and migration capacity in all three cell lines.

Androgen deprivation therapy leads to apoptosis of prostatic cells and organ regression, and is a cornerstone of prostate cancer and benign prostatic hypertrophy treatment. For several decades, androgen deprivation has been used as an adjuvant to external beam radiotherapy, however, emerging data suggests that the low rates of epithelial proliferation in the castrated prostate imparts radio-resistance. As proliferating cells exhibit increased sensitivity to radiation, we hypothesized that short bursts of synchronized epithelial proliferation, which can be achieved by exogeneous testosterone supplementation prior to targeted high-dose radiation, would maximize sustained prostate ablation, while minimizing damage to surrounding tissues. To test this hypothesis, we designed a novel computed-tomography (CT)-guided stereotactic prostate radiation therapy (CT-SPRT) technique to deliver a single high-dose 25 Gy fraction of X-ray radiation. Sustained prostatic cell ablation was assessed post CT-SPRT by measuring prostate weight, epithelial cell number, and relative contributions of luminal and basal epithelial populations in control and testosterone-pretreated glands. CT-SPRT was safely delivered with no observed damage to surrounding rectal and bladder tissues. Importantly, castrated mice that received a pulse of testosterone to induce synchronous cell proliferation prior to CT-SPRT exhibited significant sustained gland ablation compared to control mice.

SUMO-specific protease SENP1 mediates the de-SUMOylation of hexokinase 2. SUMO-defective hexokinase 2 preferably binds to mitochondria and enhances both glucose consumption and lactate production and decreases mitochondrial respiration in parallel. This metabolic reprogramming supports prostate cancer cell proliferation and protects cells from chemotherapy-induced cell apoptosis.

FGF21 inhibited the proliferation and clone formation of LNCaP cells (a PCa cell line) and promoted apoptosis. FGF21 also inhibited PCa cell migration and invasiveness. The Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses revealed that FGF21 was related to autophagy and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt kinase-mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K-Akt-mTOR) pathway.

Here, we investigated the expression and function of KIF18B in human PCa specimens and cell lines using bioinformatics analyses, immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence microscopy, and RT-qPCR and western blot analyses. KIF18B was overexpressed in PCa specimens compared with paracancerous tissues and was associated with poorer disease-free survival. In vitro, KIF18B knockdown in PCa cell lines promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and inhibited cell apoptosis, while KIF18B overexpression had the opposite effects. In a mouse xenograft model, KIF18B overexpression accelerated and promoted the growth of PCa tumors. Bioinformatics analysis of control and KIF18B-overexpressing PCa cells showed that genes involved in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway were significantly enriched among the differentially expressed genes. Consistent with this observation, we found that KIF18B overexpression activates the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway in PCa cells both in vitro and in vivo.

This study investigated the supposed ""lower risk"" Filipino and ""higher risk"" American PCa patients from the PH and the United States of America (USA), respectively. We examined 348 (176 from PH, 172 from USA) radical prostatectomy cases. The clinicopathologic features of both groups (age at time of diagnosis, preoperative prostate-specific antigen [pre-op PSA] level, Gleason score [GS], Grade groups [GG], margin involvement, extraprostatic extension [EPE], seminal vesicle invasion [SVI], and regional lymph node [RLN] metastasis) were compared. Six of seven prognosticators examined were more strongly associated with Filipinos than with Americans. Filipinos were older at diagnosis (PH: 64.32 ± 6.56 years vs USA: 58.98 ± 8.08 years) and had higher pre-op PSA levels (PH: 21.39 ± 46.40 ng ml-1 vs USA: 7.63 ± 9.19 ng ml-1). Filipino men had more advanced grade, GG 2 with minor pattern 5 (PH: 6.2% vs USA: 2.9%) and GG 5 (PH: 14.8% vs USA: 3.5%). Likewise, other adverse pathological features in margin positivity (PH: 52.3% vs USA: 23.8%), focal EPE (PH: 14.2% vs USA: 2.3%), and SVI (PH: 17.1% vs USA: 5.8%) were more commonly observed in Filipinos. This study reveals the prognostic disadvantage of Filipinos versus Americans and highlights an important difference of Filipinos from other studied Asian ethnicities that have repeatedly been shown to have lower-risk PCa.

How metabolic alterations contribute to hormonal therapy resistance and disease progression in prostate cancer (PCa) remains poorly understood. Here we report a glutaminase isoform switch mechanism that mediates the initial therapeutic effect but eventual failure of hormonal therapy of PCa. Androgen deprivation therapy inhibits the expression of kidney-type glutaminase (KGA), a splicing isoform of glutaminase 1 (GLS1) up-regulated by androgen receptor (AR), to achieve therapeutic effect by suppressing glutaminolysis. Eventually the tumor cells switch to the expression of glutaminase C (GAC), an androgen-independent GLS1 isoform with more potent enzymatic activity, under the androgen-deprived condition. This switch leads to increased glutamine utilization, hyperproliferation, and aggressive behavior of tumor cells. Pharmacological inhibition or RNA interference of GAC shows better treatment effect for castration-resistant PCa than for hormone-sensitive PCa in vitro and in vivo. In summary, we have identified a metabolic function of AR action in PCa and discovered that the GLS1 isoform switch is one of the key mechanisms in therapeutic resistance and disease progression.""","""['Lingfan Xu', 'Yu Yin', 'Yanjing Li', 'Xufeng Chen', 'Yan Chang', 'Hong Zhang', 'Juan Liu', 'James Beasley', 'Patricia McCaw', 'Haoyue Zhang', 'Sarah Young', 'Jeff Groth', 'Qianben Wang', 'Jason W Locasale', 'Xia Gao', 'Dean G Tang', 'Xuesen Dong', 'Yiping He', 'Daniel George', 'Hailiang Hu', 'Jiaoti Huang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Uro-Science.', 'Preclinical Study using Malat1 Small Interfering RNA or Androgen Receptor Splicing Variant 7 Degradation Enhancer ASC-J9® to Suppress Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Glutaminolysis is a metabolic route essential for survival and growth of prostate cancer cells and a target of 5α-dihydrotestosterone regulation.', 'GLS-driven glutamine catabolism contributes to prostate cancer radiosensitivity by regulating the redox state, stemness and ATG5-mediated autophagy.', 'Understanding the mechanisms of androgen deprivation resistance in prostate cancer at the molecular level.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Critical role of antioxidant programs in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Alone and together: current approaches to targeting glutaminase enzymes as part of anti-cancer therapies.', 'A Five Glutamine-Associated Signature Predicts Prognosis of Prostate Cancer and Links Glutamine Metabolism with Tumor Microenvironment.', 'The role of glutamine metabolism in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Identification of GLS as a cuproptosis-related diagnosis gene in acute myocardial infarction.']"""

However, there are no markers for monitoring response and resistance to Radium-223 treatment. Exosomes are mediators of intercellular communication and may reflect response of the bone microenvironment to Radium-223 treatment. We performed molecular profiling of exosomes and compared the molecular profile in patients with favorable and unfavorable overall survival.  Experimental design:   We performed exosomal transcriptome analysis in plasma derived from our preclinical models (MDA-PCa 118b tumors, TRAMP-C2/BMP4 PCa) and from the plasma of 25 patients (paired baseline and end of treatment) treated with Radium-223. All samples were run in duplicate, and array data analyzed with fold changes +2 to -2 and P < 0.05.  Results:   We utilized the preclinical models to establish that genes derived from the tumor and the tumor-associated bone microenvironment (bTME) are differentially enriched in plasma exosomes upon Radium-223 treatment. The mouse transcriptome analysis revealed changes in bone-related and DNA damage repair-related pathways. Similar findings were observed in plasma-derived exosomes from patients treated with Radium-223 detected changes. In addition, exosomal transcripts detected immune-suppressors (e.g., PD-L1) that were associated with shorter survival to Radium-223. Treatment of the Myc-CaP mouse model with a combination of Radium-223 and immune checkpoint therapy (ICT) resulted in greater efficacy than monotherapy.

A multi-institutional phase 2 prospective trial was conducted to assess whether placement of a perirectal hydrogel spacer would reduce acute periprostatic rectal ulcer events after high-dose (>40 Gy) SABR.  Methods and materials:   Eligible patients included men with stage ≤T2c localized grade group 1 to 3 prostate cancer, a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level ≤15 ng/mL, American Urological Association Symptom Index = AUA-SI scores ≤18, and a gland volume ≤80 cm3. Patients underwent perirectal hydrogel spacer placement, followed by SABR of 45 Gy in 5 fractions every other day to the prostate only. Androgen deprivation was not allowed except for cytoreduction. The rectal wall was directly assessed by serial anoscopy during follow-up to determine whether the spacer would reduce acute periprostatic rectal ulcer events from >90% to <70% within 9 months of treatment.  Results:   Forty-four men were enrolled and 43 were eligible for protocol analysis. The median follow-up for surviving patients was 48 months.

Although its role in other solid tumors, particularly renal cell carcinoma, has been sufficiently elucidated, it remains elusive in prostate cancer. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of main proteins involved in this pathway and determine the correlation of the results with clinicopathological outcomes of patients with prostate cancer.  Methods:   The immunohistochemical expression of HIF-1a, HIF-2a and their regulators, prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD)1, PHD2 and PHD3 and factor inhibiting HIF (FIH), was assessed on a tissue microarray. This was constructed from radical prostatectomy specimens, involving both tumor and corresponding adjacent non-tumoral prostate tissues from 50 patients with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer.  Results:   In comparison with non-tumoral adjacent tissue, HIF-1a exhibited an equal or lower expression in 86% of the specimens (P = 0.017), while HIF-2a was overexpressed in 52% (P = 0.032) of the cases.

Materials and methods:   150 patients who had prebiopsy mpMRI, serum PSA concentration and subsequent biopsy were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were stratified by PSA concentration (Group1 ≥ 10 ng/mL; Group2 4.0-<10 ng/mL). MRI findings were assessed using PI-RADSv2.0 by two blinded radiologists. Lesions were graded histopathologically using the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) score. Diagnostic performance of PI-RADSv2.0 was evaluated and compared to PSA and PSA Density (PSAD). The performance of the radiologists was compared including inter-observer agreement for PI-RADSv2.0. The correlation between imaging and histopathological biopsy results was analyzed.  Results:   The differences in total PSA, free/total PSA ratio and PSAD between benign (n = 78) and malignant (n = 72) groups were significant (p < 0.05). The PI-RADSv2.0 scores of the radiologists were strongly correlated (r = 0.912, p < 0.001) with excellent agreement, κ = 0.97 (95%CI: 0.90-1.03; p < 0.005). Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis showed significantly high predictive power for PI-RADSv2.0, total PSA and PSAD alone. Comparison of age, prostate volume, PSAD, free/total PSA ratio and total PSA values between ISUP1 and ISUP ≥ 2 cases revealed significantly increased PSAD (p < 0.001) and total PSA (p = 0.001) in the ISUP ≥ 2 group.  Conclusion:   PI-RADSv2.0 had high diagnostic accuracy in both PSA groups. PI-RADSv2.0, PSAD and total PSA alone had significant high predictive power to detect csPCa.

It is, therefore, crucial to understand the response mechanisms in cancer cells irradiated with low (clinical) doses. The cell's response to irradiation depends on a dose and post-irradiation time. Both factors should be considered when studying the influence of ionizing radiation on cancer cells. Thus, in the present study, PC-3 prostate cancer cells were irradiated with clinical doses of X-rays to determine dose- and time-dependent response to the irradiation. Raman spectroscopy and biological methods (MTT and comet assays) were applied for the analysis of biochemical changes in the cells induced by low doses of X-ray irradiation at 0 h and 24 h post-irradiation timepoints. Due to a limited view of the biochemical changes at the subcellular level given by single spectrum Raman measurements, Raman mapping of the whole cell area was performed. The results were compared with those obtained for cell irradiation with high doses. The analysis was based on the Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) method for the cytoplasmic and nuclear regions separately.

This study aimed to delineate the molecular mechanisms of PCa progression under HFD milieus and define the stromal microenvironment focusing on macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1) activation.  Methods:   We investigated the effects of HFD on PCa stromal microenvironment and MIC-1 signaling activation using PC-3M-luc-C6 PCa model mice fed with HFD or control diet. Further, we explored the effect of periprostatic adipocytes derived from primary PCa patients on activation and cytokine secretion of prostate stromal fibroblasts. Expression patterns and roles of MIC-1 signaling on human PCa stroma activation and progression were also investigated.  Results:   HFD stimulated PCa cell growth and invasion as a result of upregulated MIC-1 signaling and subsequently increased the secretion of interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-6 from prostate stromal fibroblasts in PC-3M-luc-C6 PCa mouse model. In addition, periprostatic adipocytes directly stimulated MIC-1 production from PC-3 cells and IL-8 secretion in prostate stromal fibroblasts through the upregulation of adipose lipolysis and free fatty acid release. The increased serum MIC-1 was significantly correlated with human PCa stroma activation, high serum IL-8, IL-6, and lipase activity, advanced PCa progression, and high body mass index of the patients. Glial-derived neurotrophic factor receptor α-like (GFRAL), a specific receptor of MIC-1, was highly expressed in both cytoplasm and membrane of PCa cells and surrounding stromal fibroblasts, and the expression level was decreased by androgen deprivation therapy and chemotherapy.  Conclusion:   HFD-mediated activation of the PCa stromal microenvironment through metabolically upregulated MIC-1 signaling by increased available free fatty acids may be a critical mechanism of HFD and/or obesity-induced PCa progression.""","""['Mingguo Huang', 'Shintaro Narita', 'Atsushi Koizumi', 'Taketoshi Nara', 'Kazuyuki Numakura', 'Shigeru Satoh', 'Hiroshi Nanjo', 'Tomonori Habuchi']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Commun (Lond)""","""['Diet-induced macrophage inhibitory cytokine 1 promotes prostate cancer progression.', 'Fatty acid binding protein 4 enhances prostate cancer progression by upregulating matrix metalloproteinases and stromal cell cytokine production.', 'High-Fat Diet-Induced Inflammation Accelerates Prostate Cancer Growth via IL6 Signaling.', 'Progesterone receptor in the prostate: A potential suppressor for benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'The Role of Androgen Receptor in Cross Talk Between Stromal Cells and Prostate Cancer Epithelial Cells.', 'Targeting lipid metabolism in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Adipose tissue macrophages: implications for obesity-associated cancer.', 'The Roles of Tumor-Associated Macrophages in Prostate Cancer.', 'Histone methyltransferase KMT2D mediated lipid metabolism via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma in prostate cancer.', 'Clinical usefulness and acceleratory effect of macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 on biliary tract cancer: an experimental biomarker analysis.']"""

We propose a novel, robust methodology to locally quantify target contour variation in a large patient cohort and find where this variation correlates with treatment outcome. We demonstrate its use on biochemical recurrence for prostate cancer patients.  Method:   We propose to compare each patient's target contours to a consistent and unbiased reference. This reference was created by auto-contouring each patient's target using an externally trained deep learning algorithm. Local contour deviation measured from the reference to the manual contour was projected to a common frame of reference, creating contour deviation maps for each patient. By stacking the contour deviation maps, time to event was modeled pixel-wise using a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model (CPHM). Hazard ratio (HR) maps for each covariate were created, and regions of significance found using cluster-based permutation testing on the z-statistics. This methodology was applied to clinical target volume (CTV) contours, containing only the prostate gland, from 232 intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer patients. The reference contours were created using ADMIRE® v3.4 (Elekta AB, Sweden). Local contour deviations were computed in a spherical coordinate frame, where differences between reference and clinical contours were projected in a 2D map corresponding to sampling across the coronal and transverse angles every 3°. Time to biochemical recurrence was modeled using the pixel-wise CPHM analysis accounting for contour deviation, patient age, Gleason score, and treated CTV volume.  Results:   We successfully applied the proposed methodology to a large patient cohort containing data from 232 patients. In this patient cohort, our analysis highlighted regions where the contour variation was related to biochemical recurrence, producing expected and unexpected results: (a) the interface between prostate-bladder and prostate-seminal vesicle interfaces where increase in the manual contour relative to the reference was related to a reduction of risk of biochemical recurrence by 4-8% per mm and (b) the prostate's right, anterior and posterior regions where an increase in the manual contour relative to the reference contours was related to an increase in risk of biochemical recurrence by 8-24% per mm.  Conclusion:   We proposed and successfully applied a novel methodology to explore the correlation between contour variation and treatment outcome. We analyzed the effect of contour deviation of the prostate CTV on biochemical recurrence for a cohort of more than 200 prostate cancer patients while taking basic clinical variables into account. Applying this methodology to a larger dataset including additional clinically important covariates and externally validating it can more robustly identify regions where contour variation directly relates to treatment outcome. For example, in the prostate case we use to demonstrate our novel methodology, external validation will help confirm or reject the counter-intuitive results (larger contours resulting in higher risk). Ultimately, the results of this methodology could inform contouring protocols based on actual patient outcomes.""","""['Alexander Jenkins', 'Thomas Soares Mullen', 'Corinne Johnson-Hart', 'Andrew Green', 'Alan McWilliam', 'Marianne Aznar', 'Marcel van Herk', 'Eliana Vasquez Osorio']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Intra- and inter-observer variability in contouring prostate and seminal vesicles: implications for conformal treatment planning.', 'Clinical Evaluation of Deep Learning and Atlas-Based Auto-Contouring of Bladder and Rectum for Prostate Radiation Therapy.', 'Evaluation of a commercial DIR platform for contour propagation in prostate cancer patients treated with IMRT/VMAT.', 'Contouring variability of human- and deformable-generated contours in radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Prospects for daily online adaptive radiotherapy via ethos for prostate cancer patients without nodal involvement using unedited CBCT auto-segmentation.', 'Dose outside of the prostate is associated with improved outcomes for high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with brachytherapy boost.']"""

However, the role of ephrin-A2 in prostate cancer is remains elusive.  Methods:   We established stable clones overexpressing or silencing ephrin-A2 from prostate cancer cells. Then, CCK-8 was used in analyzing the proliferation ability of cells. CD31 staining was used in evaluating angiogenesis. Migration and invasion assay were conducted in vivo and in vitro. The expression of EMT-related markers was evaluated in prostate cancer cells through Western blotting.  Results:   We revealed that the ectopic expression of ephrin-A2 in prostate cancer cells facilitated cell migration and invasion in vitro and promoted tumor metastasis and angiogenesis in vivo and that the silencing of ephrin-A2 completely reversed this effect. Although ephrin-A2 did not affect tumor cell proliferation in vitro, ephrin-A2 significantly promoted primary tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, to determine the biological function of ephrin-A2, we assayed the expression of EMT-related markers in stable-established cell lines. Results showed that the overexpression of ephrin-A2 in prostate cancer cells down-regulated the expression of epithelial markers (ZO-1, E-cadherin, and claudin-1) and up-regulated the expression of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, β-catenin, vimentin, Slug, and Snail), but the knocking out of ephrin-A2 opposed the effects on the expression of EMT markers.

Methods:   We identified men with commercial insurance who underwent prostate biopsy (2009-2015) with prophylactic antibiotic coverage. Our primary exposure of interest was antibiotic regimen: enhanced, oral-only, and parenteral-only. Post-biopsy outcomes of interest included urinary tract infections and sepsis/bacteremia after prostate biopsy.

INPP4B suppresses AKT and PKC signaling in the liver thereby improving insulin sensitivity. INPP4B loss results in the proteolytic cleavage and activation of a key regulator in de novo lipogenesis and lipid storage, SREBP1. In mice fed with the high fat diet, SREBP1 increases expression and activity of PPARG and other lipogenic pathways, leading to obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Inpp4b-/- male mice have reduced energy expenditure and respiratory exchange ratio leading to increased adiposity and insulin resistance. When treated with high fat diet, Inpp4b-/- males develop type II diabetes and inflammation of adipose tissue and prostate.

In men with BPH, finasteride treatment induced EGFR nuclear expression, but, when finasteride was combined with isoflavones, EGFR remained on the cell membrane. In GG4 patients, blocking of AR for 4 mo to 6 mo resulted in loss of ERβ and PTEN expression and increase in patients with nuclear EGFR from 10 to 40%. In the men with GG4 PCa, blocking of adrenal synthesis of testosterone for 2 mo to 7 mo had the beneficial effect of increasing ERβ expression, but, on treatment longer than 8 mo, ERβ was lost and EGFR moved to the nucleus. Since nuclear EGFR is a predictor of poor outcome in PCa, addition of ERβ agonists together with abiraterone should be considered as a treatment that might sustain expression of ERβ and offer some benefit to patients.""","""['Wan-Fu Wu', 'Li Wang', 'Nicholas Spetsieris', 'Myrto Boukovala', 'Eleni Efstathiou', 'Clemens Brössner', 'Margaret Warner', 'Jan-Ake Gustafsson']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Tissue Effects in a Randomized Controlled Trial of Short-term Finasteride in Early Prostate Cancer.', 'The long noncoding RNA H19 regulates tumor plasticity in neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Combination therapy with androgen receptor N-terminal domain antagonist EPI-7170 and enzalutamide yields synergistic activity in AR-V7-positive prostate cancer.', 'Darolutamide as a Second-Generation Androgen Receptor Inhibitor in the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Adding abiraterone to androgen deprivation therapy in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: A\xa0systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'IL-1RA promotes oral squamous cell carcinoma malignancy through mitochondrial metabolism-mediated EGFR/JNK/SOX2 pathway.', 'The Role of ERα and ERβ in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer and Current Therapeutic Approaches.', 'Transcriptional Profile Associated with Clinical Outcomes in Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer Treated with Androgen Deprivation and Docetaxel.', 'Signal Crosstalk and the Role of Estrogen Receptor beta (ERβ) in Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting tumor innervation: premises, promises, and challenges.']"""

However, most men lack CTC AR-V7 detection, and additional predictive biomarkers are needed. We conducted a retrospective secondary analysis of the prospective PROPHECY trial (NCT02269982) of men with mCRPC undergoing treatment with enzalutamide/abiraterone, analyzing pooled CTC and germline DNA for whole-genome copy-number alterations (CNA) in 73 samples from 48 men over time along with pooled CTC and germline whole-exome sequencing on 22 paired samples before and following progression on androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor therapy to identify somatic genomic alterations associated with acquired resistance. We observed broad interpatient and longitudinal CTC genomic heterogeneity from AR-V7-negative men with mCRPC, including common gains of KDM6A, MYCN, and AR, and loss of ZFHX3, BRCA1, and PTEN. Men who had progression-free survival of ≤3 months despite enzalutamide/abiraterone treatment were more likely to have baseline CTC genomic loss of CHD1, PTEN, PHLPP1, and ZFHX3 and gains of BRCA2, KDM5D, MYCN, and SPARC. After progression on abiraterone/enzalutamide, we observed clonal evolution of CTCs harboring TP53 mutations and gain of ATM, KDM6A, and MYC, and loss of NCOR1, PTEN, RB1, and RUNX2. CTC genomic findings were independently confirmed in a separate cohort of mCRPC men who progressed despite prior treatment with abiraterone/enzalutamide (NCT02204943). IMPLICATIONS: We identified common and reproducible genomic alterations in CTCs from AR-V7-negative mCRPC men associated with poor outcomes during enzalutamide/abiraterone treatment, including CNAs in genes linked to lineage plasticity and epigenetic signaling, DNA repair, AR, TP53/RB1, PTEN, and WNT pathways.""","""['Santosh Gupta', 'Susan Halabi', 'Gabor Kemeny', 'Monika Anand', 'Paraskevi Giannakakou', 'David M Nanus', 'Daniel J George', 'Simon G Gregory', 'Andrew J Armstrong']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Prospective Multicenter Validation of Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 and Hormone Therapy Resistance in High-Risk Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: The PROPHECY Study.', 'Whole Genomic Copy Number Alterations in Circulating Tumor Cells from Men with Abiraterone or Enzalutamide-Resistant Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Discordant and heterogeneous clinically relevant genomic alterations in circulating tumor cells vs plasma DNA from men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Development of AR-V7 as a putative treatment selection marker for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'AR-V7 Androgen Receptor Variant as a Predictor of Response to Androgen-receptor Targeting Agents Used to Treat Castration-refractory Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Recent Advances in Blood-Based Liquid Biopsy Approaches in Prostate Cancer.', 'A kinome-wide CRISPR screen identifies CK1α as a target to overcome enzalutamide resistance of prostate cancer.', 'PSMA-positive Circulating Tumor Cell Detection and Outcomes with Abiraterone or Enzalutamide Treatment in Men with Metastatic Castrate-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Addressing the Reciprocal Crosstalk between the AR and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling Pathways for Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Analysis of BRCA2 Copy Number Loss and Genomic Instability in Circulating Tumor Cells from Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

Deregulation of TAGLN contributes to the development of different cancers, and it is commonly considered to be a tumor suppressor. TAGLN is usually downregulated in prostate cancer; however, the detailed functions of TAGLN in prostate cancer and how TAGLN is regulated remains unclear. In this study, we confirmed that TAGLN is downregulated in prostate cancer tissues and demonstrated that the downregulation of TAGLN occurs through proteasomal degradation. Next, we found that the expression level of TAGLN is inversely correlated with TRAF6. We screened more than 20 E2-E3 pairs by in vitro ubiquitination assay and found that the E2A-TRAF6 pair catalyzed mono ubiquitination of TAGLN. We then identified the ubiquitination sites of TAGLN to be on K89 or K108 residues and demonstrated that ubiquitination of TAGLN on K89/K108 are important for TRAF6-mediated proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, we investigated the function of TAGLN in prostate cancer cells. We found that ablation of TAGLN promoted prostate cancer cell proliferation and suppressed their migration via activation of NF-κB and Myc signaling pathways. Overall, our study provided new insights into the mechanisms underlying TAGLN expression and activity in prostate cancer.

However, mpMRI fails to visualize approximately 15% of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). The molecular, cellular, and spatial underpinnings of such radiographic heterogeneity in csPCa are unclear.  Experimental design:   We examined tumor tissues from clinically matched patients with mpMRI-invisible and mpMRI-visible csPCa who underwent radical prostatectomy. Multiplex immunofluorescence single-cell spatial imaging and gene expression profiling were performed. Artificial intelligence-based analytic algorithms were developed to examine the tumor ecosystem and integrate with corresponding transcriptomics.  Results:   More complex and compact epithelial tumor architectures were found in mpMRI-visible than in mpMRI-invisible prostate cancer tumors. In contrast, similar stromal patterns were detected between mpMRI-invisible prostate cancer and normal prostate tissues. Furthermore, quantification of immune cell composition and tumor-immune interactions demonstrated a lack of immune cell infiltration in the malignant but not in the adjacent nonmalignant tissue compartments, irrespective of mpMRI visibility. No significant difference in immune profiles was detected between mpMRI-visible and mpMRI-invisible prostate cancer within our patient cohort, whereas expression profiling identified a 24-gene stromal signature enriched in mpMRI-invisible prostate cancer. Prostate cancer with strong stromal signature exhibited a favorable survival outcome within The Cancer Genome Atlas prostate cancer cohort. Notably, five recurrences in the 8 mpMRI-visible patients with csPCa and no recurrence in the 8 clinically matched patients with mpMRI-invisible csPCa occurred during the 5-year follow-up post-prostatectomy.

Patients and methods:   In a phase I, 3+3 dose-escalation trial (NCT03098160), evofosfamide (400-640 mg/m2) and ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) were administered in four 3-week cycles. The former was administered on days 1 and 8 of cycles 1-2, while the latter was administered on day 8 of cycles 1-4. Response was assessed using immune-related RECIST and retreatment was allowed, if deemed beneficial, after completion of cycle 4 or at progression.  Results:   Twenty-two patients were enrolled, of whom 21 were evaluable, encompassing castration-resistant prostate cancer (n = 11), pancreatic cancer (n = 7), immunotherapy-resistant melanoma (n = 2), and human papillomavirus-negative head and neck cancer (n = 1). Drug-related hematologic toxicities, rash, fever, nausea, vomiting, and elevation of liver enzymes were observed in > 10% of patients. The most common drug-related grade 3 adverse event was alanine aminotransferase elevation (33.3%). Two patients discontinued ipilimumab and 4 required evofosfamide deescalation due to toxicity. Of 18 patients with measurable disease at baseline, 3 (16.7%) achieved partial response and 12 (66.7%) achieved stable disease. The best responses were observed at 560 mg/m2 evofosfamide. Preexisting immune gene signatures predicted response to therapy, while hypermetabolic tumors predicted progression.

Previous studies have shown that TUBB3 expression is upregulated in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CaP) and is involved in taxane resistance. However, the biological mechanism of TUBB3 involvement in the progression to castration-resistant CaP is not fully elucidated. This study aimed to analyze the expression and function of TUBB3 in localized and metastatic CaP.  Methods:   TUBB3 expression was determined using immunohistochemistry in localized and metastatic CaP. We also investigated the association between TUBB3, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and neuroendocrine differentiation and examined the involvement of TUBB3 in new antiandrogen drugs (enzalutamide and apalutamide) resistance in metastatic CaP.  Results:   In 155 cases of localized CaP, immunohistochemistry showed that 5 (3.2%) of the CaP cases were positive for tubulin-β3. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that high expression of tubulin-β3 was associated with poor prostate-specific antigen recurrence-free survival after radical prostatectomy. In 57 cases of metastatic CaP, immunohistochemistry showed that 14 (25%) cases were positive for tubulin-β3. Tubulin-β3 expression was higher in metastatic CaP than in localized CaP. High tubulin-β3 expression was correlated with negative PTEN expression. TUBB3 expression was increased in neuroendocrine CaP based on several public databases. PTEN knockout decreased the sensitivity to enzalutamide and apalutamide in 22Rv-1 cells. TUBB3 knockdown reversed the sensitivity to enzalutamide and apalutamide in PTEN-CRISPR 22Rv-1 cells. High expression of tubulin-β3 and negative expression of PTEN were significantly associated with poor overall survival in metastatic CaP treated with androgen deprivation therapy.

One of its functions is to act as a receptor mediating the ligand internalization. This PSMA property is employed in the diagnostics and therapy of prostate cancer. Over the years, small molecules with high affinity for PSMA have been developed and labelled with positron emitters (e.g. 68Ga, 18F, 11C, 64Cu, or 86Y). One of these radiolabelled ligands, [68Ga] PSMA-11, is one of the most widespread tracers for PET imaging of the prostate cancer. Many techniques have been proposed and tested for the 68Ga labelling of PSMA-11. The aim of our work was to design a labelling method of PSMA-11 that minimizes number of the used chemicals and steps, providing quantitative labelling yield at laboratory temperature and may be easily automated.  Methodology:   A68Ge/68Ga generator eluate in 0.1 M HCl was loaded on an activated Oasis MCX cartridge, and the cartridge was then thoroughly washed with water. The radionuclide 68Ga was eluted from the cartridge with 0.1 M NaHCO3 (pH = 8.5, n = 36) or with the same solution with pH adjusted to 7.2-9.0 (n = 38). Precursor PSMA-11 was mixed directly with the cartridge eluate of 68Ga in 0.1 M NaHCO3 of given pH. For the stability test, samples of 68GaPSMA-11 in 0.1 M NaHCO3 (pH 8.5) were mixed in ratio 1 : 1 with the following solutions: 0.1 M NaHCO3 (pH 8.5), human serum, PBS and 0.9% NaCl. In order to estimate an effect of the time elapsed between 68Ga elution from the cartridge in 0.1 M NaHCO3 (pH 8.5) and the labelling onset of PSMA-11, the latter was initiated 0, 5, 10 and 20 min post elution and radiochemical yield was monitored. All the PSMA-11 labelled samples were subjected to radiochemical purity test using HPLC. The whole process starting from generator elution up to HPLC analysis commencement took 10-15 min.  Results:   Recovery of 68Ga from cartridge Oasis MCX using 0.1 M NaHCO3 at pH 8.5 was 71.5 ± 1.4%. Thirty six PSMA-11 samples (10 μg in reaction mixture) were labelled at pH 8.5 with total average radiochemical yield of 98 ± 2%. Recovery of 68Ga from cartridge Oasis MCX using 0.1 M NaHCO3 at variable pH of 7.2-9.0 was 62.5 ± 1.8% showing certain decrease with decreasing pH. A total of 138 samples of PSMA-11 were labelled with 68 Ga at variable pH (7.2-9.0) and four different amounts of PSMA-11 (1, 2.5, 5 and 10 μg) resulting in the labelling yields of 54.0 ± 5.3%, 88.2 ± 3.2%, 99.4 ± 0.3% and 99.9 ± 0.1%, respectively. Irrespective of the pH, the radiolabelling yield was quantitative for the molar ratio PSMA-11: 68Ga > 5000 : 1 in the reaction mixture. Stability tests in 0.1 M NaHCO3 (pH 8.5), human serum, PBS and 0.9% NaCl revealed no observable release of 68Ga from the 68Ga-PSMA-11 complex within 3 h. Similarly, the delay between the 68Ga elution from the Oasis MCX cartridge in 0.1 M NaHCO3 (pH 8.5) and start of the labelling of PSMA-11 labelling has no effect on the radiochemical yield.  Conclusion:   A new method of labelling PSMA-11 ligand with 68Ga in 0.1 M NaHCO3 using Oasis MCX cartridges was proposed, developed and tested. The results demonstrated that it is rapid, simple, reproducible and easy to automate.""","""['Kamila Urbanová', 'Daniel Seifert', 'Hana Vinšová', 'Martin Vlk', 'Ondřej Lebeda']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Appl Radiat Isot""","""['Optimization of Labeling PSMAHBED with Ethanol-Postprocessed 68Ga and Its Quality Control Systems.', 'Cold Kit for Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) PET Imaging: Phase 1 Study of 68Ga-Tris(Hydroxypyridinone)-PSMA PET/CT in Patients with Prostate Cancer.', '68Ga-THP-PSMA: A PET Imaging Agent for Prostate Cancer Offering Rapid, Room-Temperature, 1-Step Kit-Based Radiolabeling.', '18F-Labeled, PSMA-Targeted Radiotracers: Leveraging the Advantages of Radiofluorination for Prostate Cancer Molecular Imaging.', 'Gallium-68 Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen PET Imaging.', 'New Approved Drugs Appearing in the Pharmaceutical Market in 2022 Featuring Fragments of Tailor-Made Amino Acids and Fluorine.', 'The Pharmaceutical Technology Approach on Imaging Innovations from Italian Research.']"""

The broad-based capsule-tumor interface has been recognized as one of the worrisome imaging features in multiparametric prostate MRI (mpMRI). However, there was significant heterogeneity among the measurement method used in prior studies.  Objectives:   This study's objectives were to investigate and compare the accuracy between the curvilinear and linear measurement, find the optimal cut-off contact surface threshold for the diagnosis of EPE, and assess the benefit of the additional contact surface measurement versus visual assessment alone.  Methods:   The status of EPE in mpMRI and the overall PI-RADS were assessed. The tumor's dimensions, the actual tumor-capsule contact length (ACTCL), and the absolute tumor-capsule contact length (ABTCL) were measured. The parameters were analyzed and correlated with the EPE status from prostatectomy specimens.  Results:   Ninety-five patients who underwent mpMRI followed by prostatectomy were included in the study. High Gleason score (score 8-9), radiologist's impression of EPE, and PI-RADS 5 were significantly correlated with EPE in surgical specimens (p = 0.014, p < 0.001, and p < 0.001, respectively). Both ACTCL and ABTCL of patients with EPE were significantly higher than those without EPE in all imaging sequences (p < 0.001 to p = 0.003). The ABTCL has higher accuracy than the ACTCL. Dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) was the most accurate sequence to measure the contact interface. The recommended cut-off value of ABTCL was 15.0 mm, which had a sensitivity and specificity of 75.86% and 72.09%. Multivariable analysis revealed that the ABTCL > 15 mm and the radiologist's impression on visual assessment were the only two independent predictors for the prediction of EPE (p = 0.048 and p = 0.016, respectively). Improvement of diagnostic performance was achieved when the two factors were combined.  Conclusion:   The ABTCL has better accuracy than the curvilinear measurement in the prediction of EPE. The optimum sequence for the measurement of the contact surface is the DCE. We recommended using 15.0 mm as a cut-off point.  Clinical impact:   The addition of the ABTCL measurement showed an increase in diagnostic performance. We encourage radiologists to use the capsular contact measurement in addition to their visual assessment to detect EPE in pre-operative MRI.""","""['Kulyada Eurboonyanun', 'Nisanard Pisuchpen', ""Aileen O'Shea"", 'Rita Maria Lahoud', 'Isha D Atre', 'Mukesh Harisinghani']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Abdom Radiol (NY)""","""['Combined Clinical Parameters and Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for the Prediction of Extraprostatic Disease-A Risk Model for Patient-tailored Risk Stratification When Planning Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Evaluation of the most optimal multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging sequence for determining pathological length of capsular contact.', 'Prediction of extraprostatic extension on multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging in patients with anterior prostate cancer.', 'A Grading System for the Assessment of Risk of Extraprostatic Extension of Prostate Cancer at Multiparametric MRI.', 'Extraprostatic extension in prostate cancer: primer for radiologists.', 'Imaging features of the PI-RADS for predicting extraprostatic extension of prostate cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Validating the screening criteria for bone metastases in treatment-naïve unfavorable intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer - the prevalence and location of bone- and lymph node metastases.', 'Computational Detection of Extraprostatic Extension of Prostate Cancer on Multiparametric MRI Using Deep Learning.']"""

Purpose:   To investigate the value of hyoscine N-butylbromide (HBB), microenema (ME) and 'dietary restrictions' (DR) for artifact reduction and image quality (IQ) in mpMRI of the prostate.  Study type:   Retrospective.  Population:   Between 10/2018 and 02/2020 treatment-naïve men (median age, 64.9; range 39.8-87.3) who underwent mpMRI of the prostate were included. The total patient sample comprised of n = 180 patients, who received either HBB, ME, were instructed to adhere to DR, or received a combination of those measures prior to the MR scan.  Field strength/sequence:   T2-weighted imaging (T2w), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) scanned on two 3T systems.  Assessment:   A radiologist specialized in urogenital imaging (R1) and a senior radiology resident (R2) visually assessed IQ parameters on transversal T2w, DWI and ADC maps on a 5-point Likert-like scale.  Statistical tests:   Group comparison between IQ parameters was performed on reader level using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests. Binary univariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess independent predictors of IQ. Interrater agreement was assessed using Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC).  Results:   'DWI geometric distortion' was significantly more pronounced in the HBB+/ME-/DR- (R1, 3.6 and R2, 4.0) as compared to the HBB-/ME+/DR- (R1, 4.2 and R2, 4.6) and HBB+/ME+/DR- (R1, 4.3 and R2, 4.7) cohort, respectively. Parameters 'DWI IQ' and 'Whole MRI IQ' were rated similarly by both readers. ME was a significant independent predictor of 'good IQ' for the whole MRI for R1 [b = 1.09, OR 2.98 (95% CI 1.29, 6.87)] and R2 [b = 1.01, OR 2.73 (95% CI 1.24, 6.04)], respectively.

GSK3β is an isoform of GSK3 which has been projected as a potent therapeutic target in human diseases including cancers and metabolic syndrome. Incidentally, cardiovascular disease is a common cause of non-cancer related deaths in prostate cancer (PCa) patients, mainly due to the effects of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), a mainstay for PCa treatment. Several small molecular inhibitors of GSK3 are either ATP-competitive (bind to the ATP-binding pocket), or non-ATP-competitive inhibitors (binding to the substrate-binding site of the enzyme). In this study, 2-β-D-glucopyranosyl-1,3,6,7-tetrahydroxy-9H-xanthen-9-one (βDGT), a natural xanthonoid present in many plant species, is reported to bind to the ATP-binding pocket of GSK3β and inhibit its activity, as demonstrated by the molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation analysis and experimental validation in vitro. A comparison of the binding affinities with five known ATP-competitive inhibitors of GSK3β suggested similarity in binding site residues in the ATP-binding pocket of the enzyme. The optimum inhibitory concentration of the xanthonoid as determined by the luminescent kinase assay was 200 µM. The study envisages the use of βDGT as a natural ATP-competitive inhibitor of GSK3β and implicates its use in PCa patients on ADT, a cardiovascular disease risk, and other pathological conditions where GSK3 inhibition may be clinically important.

We tested the association between preoperative value of Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index (SII) and overall survival (OS) as well as cancer-specific survival (CSS) in mRCC patients treated with CN.  Methods:   mRCC patients treated with CN at different institutions were included. After assessing for the optimal pretreatment SII cut‑off value, we found 710 to have the maximum Youden Index value. The overall population was therefore divided into two SII groups using this cut‑off (low, <710 vs. high, ≥710). Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses tested the association SII and OS as well as CSS. The discrimination of the model was evaluated with the Harrel's Concordance Index (C-Index). The clinical value of the SII was evaluated with decision curve analysis (DCA).  Results:   Among 613 mRCC patients, 298 (49%) patients had a SII≥710. Median follow-up was 31 (IQR 16-58) months. On univariable analysis, high preoperative serum SII was significantly associated with worse OS (HR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.07-1.54, P=0.01) and CSS (HR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.08-1.55, P=0.01). On multivariable analysis, which adjusted for the effect of established clinicopathologic features, SII≥710 was associated with OS (HR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.04-1.50, P=0.02) and CSS (HR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.05-1.52, P=0.01). The addition of SII only slightly improved the discrimination of a base model that included established clinicopathologic features (C-index: 0.637 vs. 0.629). On DCA, the inclusion of SII did not improve the net-benefit of the prognostic model. On multivariable analyses, SII≥710 remained independently associated with the worse OS and CSS in IMDC intermediate risk group (both: HR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.02-1.67, P=0.03). In the subgroup analyses based on the BMI, among patients with BMI ≥ 25, SII was significantly associated with OS (HR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.04-1.61, P=0.02) and CSS (HR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.05-1.63, P=0.02).  Conclusions:   We found an independent association of high SII prior to CN with unfavorable clinical outcomes, particularly in patients with intermediate risk mRCC and patients with increased BMI.

The main outcome was DFS analysed through uni- and multivariable analysis, Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank testing, recursive partitioning analysis, and nomogram development.  Results:   The median follow up was 62.3 (interquartile range [IQR] 38.1-79) months. The independent clinical factors associated with increased risk of recurrence or progression in the multivariate analysis (MVA) were prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level before RT, pT3 characteristic, and local failure as salvage indication. The value of PSA nadir had a significant impact on the risk of biochemical failure. Biochemical control and DFS were significantly different depending on treatment indication (p < 0.0001). The recursive partitioning analysis highlighted the importance of the PSA level before RT, Gleason Grade Group, PSA nadir, and local failure as a treatment indication. Finally, the nomogram for DFS was developed and is available online at https://apps.konsta.com.pl/app/prostate-salvage-dfs/.  Conclusions:   The Pre-RT PSA level, pT3 characteristic and local failure as salvage indication are pivotal prognostic factors associated with increased risk of recurrence or progression. The Gleason grade group of 4-5 and PSA nadir value allow for further risk stratification.

The average flow rate (2.4 ± 1.9 vs 5.9 ± 2.4 mL/s, P = .005), peak flow rate (6.9 ± 6.2 vs 14.1 ± 5.5 mL/s, P = .003), flow time (54.6 ± 29.1 vs 23.6 ± 13.7 s, P = .002), residual urine volume (178.7 ± 195.5 vs 7.0 ± 7.1 mL, P = .004), IPSS (26.2 ± 8.1 vs 8.0 ± 6.5 points, P = .001), and QOL (4.7 ± 1.3 vs 2.4 ± 2.1 points, P = .030) improved between before and after stent insertion, respectively. Pain was the most common complication, but 60% of the patients were managed without any intervention. There were hematuria, urinary retention, urinary frequency, obstruction, and urinary incontinence. However, there was no urinary tract infection due to the stent. The median time to stent removal was 5.7 months.  Conclusions:   The stent was maintained for about 6 months with improved objective and subjective outcomes. The patients with PC, who had a poor comorbidity index and advanced PC status showed a tolerable maintenance period. Self-expandable covered metallic stents can be used for PC patients with a short life expectancy and unsuitability for general anesthesia.""","""['Se Young Choi', 'Bumjin Lim', 'Byung Hoon Chi', 'Jung Hoon Kim', 'Wonchul Lee', 'Yoon Soo Kyung', 'Dalsan You', 'Ho-Young Song', 'Choung-Soo Kim']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Low Urin Tract Symptoms""","""['Placement of retrievable self-expandable metallic stents with barbs into patients with obstructive prostate cancer.', 'Efficacy of a thermoexpandable metallic prostate stent (Memokath) in elderly patients with urethral obstruction requiring long-term management with urethral Foley catheters.', 'Thermo-expandable prostatic stents for bladder outlet obstruction in the frail and elderly population: An underutilized procedure?', 'Treating bladder-outflow obstruction with thermo-expandable prostate metal stents.', 'The thermo-expandable metallic stent for managing benign prostatic hyperplasia: a systematic review.']"""

We also sought to examine the possibility of improving treatment planning quality by re-planning in 47 patients where the quality of the target dose and the dose limits for organs at risk (OARs) were inadequate. The re-planning treatment plans referred to the Feasibility DVHTM implemented in the PlanIQTM software and modified the treatment planning system based on the target dose and OAR constraints.  Results:   Analysis of the learning curve of the treatment plans quality using PlanIQTM software retrospectively showed a trend of improvement in the treatment plan quality from year to year. The improvement in the treatment plans quality was more influenced by dose reduction in the OARs than by target coverage. In all cases where re-planning was performed, the improvement in the treatment plan's quality resulted in a better treatment plan than the one adopted for delivery to patients in the clinical plan.

Guanosine monophosphate synthetase (GMPS) acts in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, utilizing a glutamine amide to synthesize the guanine nucleotide. This study demonstrates that GMPS mRNA expression correlates with Gleason score in prostate cancer samples, while high GMPS expression was associated with decreased rates of overall and disease/progression-free survival. Pharmacological inhibition or knockdown of GMPS significantly decreased cell growth in both LNCaP and PC-3 prostate cancer cells. We utilized [15 N-(amide)]glutamine and [U-13 C5 ]glutamine metabolomics to dissect the pathways involved and despite similar growth inhibition by GMPS knockdown, we show unique metabolic effects across each cell line. Using a PC-3 xenograft mouse model, tumor growth was also significantly decreased after GMPS knockdown, highlighting the importance of glutamine metabolism and providing support for GMPS as a therapeutic target in prostate cancer. © 2021 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

A major challenge for the clinically used AR antagonists is the rapid emergence of resistance induced by the mutations at AR ligand binding domain (LBD), and therefore the discovery of novel anti-AR therapeutics that can combat mutation-induced resistance is quite demanding. Therein, blocking the interaction between AR and DNA represents an innovative strategy. However, the hits confirmed targeting on it so far are all structurally based on a sole chemical scaffold. In this study, an integrated docking-based virtual screening (VS) strategy based on the crystal structure of the DNA binding domain (DBD) of AR was conducted to search for novel AR antagonists with new scaffolds and 2-(2-butyl-1,3-dioxoisoindoline-5-carboxamido)-4,5-dimethoxybenzoicacid (Cpd39) was identified as a potential hit, which was competent to block the binding of AR DBD to DNA and showed decent potency against AR transcriptional activity. Furthermore, Cpd39 was safe and capable of effectively inhibiting the proliferation of PCa cell lines (i.e., LNCaP, PC3, DU145, and 22RV1) and reducing the expression of the genes regulated by not only the full-length AR but also the splice variant AR-V7.

The Comprehensive Lifestyle Improvement Program for Prostate Cancer (CLIPP) was created to determine the feasibility of conducing a comprehensive lifestyle modification intervention in men on ADT for prostate cancer and determine its early efficacy in reducing obesity and metabolic syndrome.  Methods:   A single-arm, open-label clinical trial was conducted by recruiting 31 men diagnosed with prostate cancer and exposed to ADT within the last 5 years. A multicomponent lifestyle modification program was delivered weekly for 16 weeks by a trained health coach. This was followed by 8 weeks of passive follow-up resulting in a total trial duration of 24 weeks. Feasibility was determined by calculating study recruitment, retention, and adherence rates. Weight and components of metabolic syndrome (waist circumference, triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), serum glucose, and blood pressure (BP)) were measured at baseline, 12, and 24 weeks.  Results:   Recruitment, retention, and adherence rates were 47.1%, 90.3%, and 100%, respectively. Statistically significant improvements were noted between baseline and end of study measurements for weight (206.3 vs. 191.3 lbs, p < 0.001), waist (41.3 vs. 38.8 inches, p < 0.001), systolic BP (144.1 vs. 133.4 mm of Hg, p = 0.014), diastolic BP (83.3 vs. 76.2 mm of Hg, p = 0.0056), TG (146.0 vs. 113.8 mg/dl, p = 0.022), HDL (51.1 vs. 55.0 mg/dl, p = 0.012), and serum glucose (114.0 vs. 103.2 mg/dl, p = 0.013).

This study investigated toxicity and clinical outcomes of focal dose escalation to the DIL with dose de-escalation to the remaining prostate.  Materials/methods:   Between November 2012 and July 2016, 50 patients with localised prostate adenocarcinoma received single fraction HDR-BT. 21 Gy was prescribed to the DIL, with two de-escalation prescription schedules for the remaining prostate.

A significant proportion of FIR CaP patients undergoing surgical treatment are found to have evidence of adverse pathology. Our objective was to determine the incidence and predictors of pathologic upgrading in FIR AS patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Prostate with Watchful Waiting (WW) database was used to identify men younger than 80 years with National Comprehensive Cancer Network FIR CaP initially opting for AS and/or WW between 2010 and 2015 and subsequently underwent radical prostatectomy at least one year following diagnosis. Patients were assigned into one of three subgroups based on their intermediate risk factor: Gleason Score 7(3 + 4) (Group 1), prostate specific antigen level of 10-20 ng/ml (Group 2), and cT2b-c (Group 3). Pathologic upgrading was present in Group 1 if pathologic GS was 7 (4 + 3) or worse. For patients in Groups 2 and 3, upgrading occurred if pathologic GS was 7 (3 + 4) or worse. Oncologic and sociodemographic predictors of pathologic upgrading were evaluated univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis.  Results:   18,760 patients were identified. Pathologic upgrading occurred in 138 (13.3%), 59 (25.0%), and 8,011 (45.8%) patients in groups 1, 2, and 3 respectively. Pathologic downgrading occurred in 226 (21.7%) patients in group 1. Significant predictors of pathologic upgrading on multivariable analysis included older age at diagnosis: 70 to 79 vs. 40 to 49 years (Groups 1 and 3, P < 0.05), a more recent diagnosis: 2014 to2015 vs. 2010-2011 (Groups 2 and 3, P < 0.005), higher volume disease: 37.5% to 49.9% vs. 0% to 12.4% (Groups 2 and 3, P < 0.005), and clinically palpable disease (Groups 1 and 2, P < 0.05).

Methods:   The Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging is a large population-based cohort of individuals aged 45-85 years when recruited (2011-2015). We used data from the comprehensive subgroup (n = 30,097) to build a retrospective cohort with individual exact matching for age (1:4 ratio). We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios of new cancer diagnosis with and without a prior stroke.  Results:   We respectively included 920 and 3,680 individuals in the stroke and non-stroke groups. We observed a higher incidence of cancer in the first year after stroke that declined afterward (p-value = 0.030). The hazard of new cancer diagnosis after stroke was significantly increased (hazard ratio: 2.36; 95% CI: 1.21, 4.61; p-value = 0.012) as compared to age-matched non-stroke participants after adjustments. The most frequent primary cancers in the first year after stroke were prostate (n = 8, 57.1%) and melanoma (n = 2, 14.3%).  Conclusions:   The hazard of new cancer diagnosis in the first year after an ischemic stroke is about 2.4 times higher as compared to age-matched individuals without stroke after adjustments. Surveillance bias may explain a portion of post-stroke cancer diagnoses although a selection bias of healthier participants likely led to an underestimation of post-stroke cancer risk.

Despite the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) proposing this as standard of care, it does not routinely take place in practice. Healthcare professionals are in a prime position to deliver and integrate these recommendations. A change in the behaviour of clinical teams is therefore required. In this paper, we describe the development of a training package for healthcare professionals using theory and evidence to promote delivery of such recommendations as standard care.  Methods:   The intervention development process was guided by the Medical Research Council guidance for complex interventions and the Behaviour Change Wheel. Target behaviours were identified from the literature and thirty-five prostate cancer care healthcare professionals (including oncologists, consultant urologists, clinical nurse specialists, physiotherapists, general practitioners and commissioners) were interviewed to understand influences on these behaviours. The Theoretical Domains Framework was used to identify theoretical constructs for change. Behaviour change techniques were selected based on theory and evidence and were translated into intervention content. The intervention was refined with the input of stakeholders including healthcare professionals, patients, and exercise professionals in the form of rehearsal deliveries, focus groups and a workshop.  Results:   Seven modifiable healthcare professional target behaviours were identified to support the delivery of the NICE recommendations including identifying eligible patients suitable for exercise, recommending exercise, providing information, exercise referral, providing support and interpret and feedback on progress. Ten domains from the Theoretical Domain's Framework were identified as necessary for change, including improving knowledge and skills, addressing beliefs about consequences, and targeting social influences. These were targeted through twenty-two behaviour change techniques delivered in a half-day, interactive training package. Based on initial feedback from stakeholders, the intervention was refined in preparation for evaluation.  Conclusions:   We designed an intervention based on theory, evidence, and stakeholder feedback to promote and support the delivery of NICE recommendations. Future work will aim to test this training package in a multi-centre randomised trial. If proven effective, the development and training package will provide a template for replication in other clinical populations, where exercise has proven efficacy but is insufficiently implemented.""","""['Rebecca R Turner', 'Madelynne A Arden', 'Sophie Reale', 'Eileen Sutton', 'Stephanie J C Taylor', 'Liam Bourke', 'Diana M Greenfield', 'Dylan Morrissey', 'Janet Brown', 'Patrick Doherty', 'Derek J Rosario', 'Liz Steed']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BMC Health Serv Res""","""['Towards implementing exercise into the prostate cancer care pathway: development of a theory and evidence-based intervention to train community-based exercise professionals to support change in patient exercise behaviour (The STAMINA trial).', 'A multi-centre investigation of delivering national guidelines on exercise training for men with advanced prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy in the UK NHS.', 'Developing and evaluating packages to support implementation of quality indicators in general practice: the ASPIRE research programme, including two cluster RCTs.', 'Delivering an iterative Communication Partner Training programme to multidisciplinary healthcare professionals: A pilot implementation study and process evaluation.', 'Supporting good quality, community-based end-of-life care for people living with dementia: the SEED research programme including feasibility RCT.', 'Lifestyle aspects in a contemporary middle-European cohort of patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy for advanced prostate cancer: data from the non-interventional LEAN study.', ""Supporting doctors' well-being and resilience during COVID-19: A framework for rapid and rigorous intervention development."", 'Embedding supervised exercise training for men on androgen deprivation therapy into standard prostate cancer care: a feasibility and acceptability study (the STAMINA trial).']"""

Materials and methods:   We tested the effect of the following variables on UIC and ED rates 1 year after RP: residual prostate volume after transurethral desobstruction, the time from transurethral desobstruction to RP, the type of transurethral desobstruction (TURP vs. laser enucleation), age, and nerve-sparing surgery (yes vs. no). UIC was defined as usage of any pad except a safety pad. ED was defined as no sexual intercourse possible.  Results:   Overall, 216 patients treated with RP between 2010 and 2019 in a tertiary care center were evaluated. All patients had previously undergone transurethral desobstruction. Regarding UIC analyses, only time from transurethral desobstruction to RP significantly influenced UIC rates (p = 0.003). Regarding ED rates, none of the tested variables reached statistical significance.  Conclusion:   The risk of UIC and ED after RP is substantial in men who had previously undergone transurethral desobstruction. The time from transurethral desobstruction to RP significantly impacts on the postoperative UIC rates. This observation should be further explored in future studies.""","""['Julia Tolle', 'Sophie Knipper', 'Randi Pose', 'Pierre Tennstedt', 'Derya Tilki', 'Markus Graefen', 'Hendrik Isbarn']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Urol Int""","""['Prostate operations: long-term effects on sexual and urinary function and quality of life.

This prediction model is based on a machine learning approach and considers 27 prognostic covariates.  Patients and methods:   This was a retrospective single-institution analysis of 326 patients, managed with palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases. Deviations between model-predicted survival and observed survival were assessed.  Results:   The median actuarial survival was 7.5 months. In total, 59% of patients survived for a period shorter than predicted. Twenty percent of the predictions of the median survival deviated from the observed survival by at least 6 months. Regarding actual survival <3 months (99 of 326 patients), the BMETS-predicted median survival was <3 months, i.e. correct in 67 of 99 cases (68%), whereas the model predicted a median of 4-6 months in 16 (16%) and of >6 months in another 16 cases.  Conclusion:   The model predicted survival with high accuracy in a large number of patients. Nevertheless, if the model predicts a low likelihood of 3-month survival, actual survival may be very poor (often 1 month or less). Also, in patients who died within 3 months from the start of radiotherapy, the model often predicted longer survival (16% had >6 months predicted median survival). It would, therefore, be interesting to feed the U.S. database utilized to develop the BMETS with additional poor-prognosis patients to optimize the predictions.""","""['Carsten Nieder', 'Bård Mannsåker', 'Rosalba Yobuta']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['Developing an Improved Statistical Approach for Survival Estimation in Bone Metastases Management: The Bone Metastases Ensemble Trees for Survival (BMETS) Model.', 'External Validation of the Bone Metastases Ensemble Trees for Survival (BMETS) Machine Learning Model to Predict Survival in Patients With Symptomatic Bone Metastases.', 'Survival After Palliative Radiotherapy in Patients with Breast Cancer and Bone-only Metastases.', 'Palliative treatment of bone metastases with bone-seeking radionuclides.', 'A systematic overview of radiation therapy effects in skeletal metastases.', 'Applications of Machine Learning in Palliative Care: A Systematic Review.', 'Short Communication: Results of a Consensus Conference on Radiotherapy for Brain and Bone Metastases Within the Interreg-Project TreaT.', 'Current Radiotherapy Concepts Regarding Brain and Bone Metastases in Centers Participating in the German-Danish Interreg-Project TreaT.', 'Evaluation of the Clinical Utility of the Bone Metastases Ensemble Trees for Survival Decision Support Platform (BMETS-DSP): A Case-Based Pilot Assessment.']"""

Along with the studies from our laboratory, it is well established that α-santalol targets the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase-AKT serine/ threonine kinase 1 (AKT) pathway to induce apoptosis but its growth-suppressive effects have not been fully elucidated. The current study was undertaken to investigate the role of autophagy in α-santalol-induced prostate cancer cell death.  Materials and methods:   Cell lines LNCaP and PC-3 were maintained in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37°C. Trypan blue dye exclusion assay was employed to assess the effects of α-santalol with/without 3-methyl adenine on the cell viability of prostate cancer cells. Acidic vesicular organelles induced by α-santalol treatment were detected by staining with acridine orange. Immunofluorescence and immunoblotting were performed to analyze expression of proteins involved in the AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway.  Results:   LNCaP and PC-3 cells upon treatment with α-santalol resulted in characteristic features analogous to autophagic response, including formation of acidic vesicular organelles, recruitment and cleavage of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) to autophagosomes. Alpha-santalol treatment further suppressed phosphorylation of activated AKT and mTOR, which are critical regulators of autophagic response. In addition, pre-treatment of PC-3 cells with specific inhibitor of autophagy (3-methyladenine) and co-treatment with α-santalol attenuated the expression of LC3-II and phospho-AKT, and significantly reduced the cell viability.  Conclusion:   The present study indicates that α-santalol induces autophagy by targeting the AKT-mTOR pathway in prostate cancer cells, which may serve as a protective mechanism.""","""['Cole Walters', 'Maverick Reed', 'Samantha Bartholomew', 'Ajay Bommareddy']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['Akt/survivin pathway inhibition enhances the apoptotic cell death-induced by alpha-santalol in human prostate cancer cells.', 'α-santalol inhibits the angiogenesis and growth of human prostate tumor growth by targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2-mediated AKT/mTOR/P70S6K signaling pathway.', 'Atg5 regulates phenethyl isothiocyanate-induced autophagic and apoptotic cell death in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Novel Insights into Autophagy and Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review.', 'New function of type I IFN: induction of autophagy.']"""

Materials and methods:   We selected 100 consecutive prostate magnetic resonance imaging cases from a publicly available data set (PROSTATEx Challenge) with and without histopathologically confirmed prostate cancer. Seven board-certified radiologists were tasked to read each case twice in 2 reading blocks (with and without the assistance of a DL-CAD), with a separation between the 2 reading sessions of at least 2 weeks. Reading tasks were to localize and classify lesions according to Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) v2.0 and to assign a radiologist's level of suspicion score (scale from 1-5 in 0.5 increments; 1, benign; 5, malignant). Ground truth was established by consensus readings of 3 experienced radiologists. The detection performance (receiver operating characteristic curves), variability (Fleiss κ), and average reading time without DL-CAD assistance were evaluated.  Results:   The average accuracy of radiologists in terms of area under the curve in detecting clinically significant cases (PI-RADS ≥4) was 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79-0.89), whereas the same using DL-CAD was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.83-0.94) with an improvement of 4.4% (95% CI, 1.1%-7.7%; P = 0.010).

A four-compartment restriction spectrum imaging (RSI4 ) model was recently found to optimally characterize pelvic diffusion signals, and the model coefficient for the slowest diffusion compartment, RSI4 -C1 , yielded greatest tumor conspicuity.  Purpose:   To evaluate the slowest diffusion compartment of a four-compartment spectrum imaging model (RSI4 -C1 ) as a quantitative voxel-level classifier of PCa.  Study type:   Retrospective.  Subjects:   Forty-six men who underwent an extended MRI acquisition protocol for suspected PCa. Twenty-three men had benign prostates, and the other 23 men had PCa.  Field strength/sequence:   A 3 T, multishell diffusion-weighted and axial T2-weighted sequences.  Assessment:   High-confidence cancer voxels were delineated by expert consensus, using imaging data and biopsy results. The entire prostate was considered benign in patients with no detectable cancer. Diffusion images were used to calculate RSI4 -C1 and conventional ADC. Classifier images were also generated.  Statistical tests:   Voxel-level discrimination of PCa from benign prostate tissue was assessed via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves generated by bootstrapping with patient-level case resampling. RSI4 -C1 was compared to conventional ADC for two metrics: area under the ROC curve (AUC) and false-positive rate for a sensitivity of 90% (FPR90 ). Statistical significance was assessed using bootstrap difference with two-sided α = 0.05.  Results:   RSI4 -C1 outperformed conventional ADC, with greater AUC (mean 0.977 [95% CI: 0.951-0.991] vs. 0.922 [0.878-0.948]) and lower FPR90 (0.032 [0.009-0.082] vs. 0.201 [0.132-0.290]). These improvements were statistically significant (P < 0.05).  Data conclusion:   RSI4 -C1 yielded a quantitative, voxel-level classifier of PCa that was superior to conventional ADC. RSI classifier images with a low false-positive rate might improve PCa detection and facilitate clinical applications like targeted biopsy and treatment planning.

An archetypal example is the development of neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) after treatment of prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) with inhibitors of androgen signaling. NEPC is an aggressive variant of prostate cancer that aberrantly expresses genes characteristic of neuroendocrine (NE) tissues and no longer depends on androgens. Here, we investigate the epigenomic basis of this resistance mechanism by profiling histone modifications in NEPC and PRAD patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) using chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq). We identify a vast network of cis-regulatory elements (N~15,000) that are recurrently activated in NEPC. The FOXA1 transcription factor (TF), which pioneers androgen receptor (AR) chromatin binding in the prostate epithelium, is reprogrammed to NE-specific regulatory elements in NEPC. Despite loss of dependence upon AR, NEPC maintains FOXA1 expression and requires FOXA1 for proliferation and expression of NE lineage-defining genes. Ectopic expression of the NE lineage TFs ASCL1 and NKX2-1 in PRAD cells reprograms FOXA1 to bind to NE regulatory elements and induces enhancer activity as evidenced by histone modifications at these sites. Our data establish the importance of FOXA1 in NEPC and provide a principled approach to identifying cancer dependencies through epigenomic profiling.""","""['Sylvan C Baca', 'David Y Takeda', 'Ji-Heui Seo', 'Justin Hwang', 'Sheng Yu Ku', 'Rand Arafeh', 'Taylor Arnoff', 'Supreet Agarwal', 'Connor Bell', ""Edward O'Connor"", 'Xintao Qiu', 'Sarah Abou Alaiwi', 'Rosario I Corona', 'Marcos A S Fonseca', 'Claudia Giambartolomei', 'Paloma Cejas', 'Klothilda Lim', 'Monica He', 'Anjali Sheahan', 'Amin Nassar', 'Jacob E Berchuck', 'Lisha Brown', 'Holly M Nguyen', 'Ilsa M Coleman', 'Arja Kaipainen', 'Navonil De Sarkar', 'Peter S Nelson', 'Colm Morrissey', 'Keegan Korthauer', 'Mark M Pomerantz', 'Leigh Ellis', 'Bogdan Pasaniuc', 'Kate Lawrenson', 'Kathleen Kelly', 'Amina Zoubeidi', 'William C Hahn', 'Himisha Beltran', 'Henry W Long', 'Myles Brown', 'Eva Corey', 'Matthew L Freedman']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Nat Commun""","""['FOXA1 inhibits prostate cancer neuroendocrine differentiation.', 'Post-transcriptional Gene Regulation by MicroRNA-194 Promotes Neuroendocrine Transdifferentiation in Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor-independent function of FoxA1 in prostate cancer metastasis.', 'Pioneer of prostate cancer: past, present and the future of FOXA1.', 'Molecular model for neuroendocrine prostate cancer progression.', 'Cellular specificity of androgen receptor, coregulators, and pioneer factors in prostate cancer.', 'Rewiring of master transcription factor cistromes during high-grade serous ovarian cancer development.', 'Landscape of prostate-specific membrane antigen heterogeneity and regulation in AR-positive and AR-negative metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Transcription factor NKX2-1 drives serine and glycine synthesis addiction in cancer.', 'Reversible epigenetic alterations mediate PSMA expression heterogeneity in advanced metastatic prostate cancer.']"""

Vγ9Vδ2 T cells exhibit dual properties since they are both antigen-presenting cells and cytotoxic toward cancer cells. The majority of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells are double-negative for the co-receptors CD4 and CD8, and only 20-30% express CD8.

These cells can be expanded in vitro using zoledronic acid, pamidronic acid or CD3 antibodies combined with IL-2 and feeder cells. Unlike most conventional CD4+ αβ T cells, CD4+ Vγ9Vδ2 T cells are potently cytotoxic and can kill cancer cells, which is here shown by the killing of cancer cell lines of different histological origins, including breast cancer, prostate cancer and melanoma cell lines, upon treatment with zoledronic acid.

Trials of intense neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (NADT) have shown lower rates of recurrence among patients with minimal residual disease after treatment. The molecular features that distinguish exceptional responders from poor responders are not known.  Objective:   To identify genomic and histologic features associated with treatment resistance at baseline.  Design, setting, and participants:   Targeted biopsies were obtained from 37 men with intermediate- to high-risk prostate cancer before receiving 6 mo of ADT plus enzalutamide. Biopsy tissues were used for whole-exome sequencing and immunohistochemistry (IHC).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We assessed the relationship of molecular features with final pathologic response using a cutpoint of 0.05 cm3 for residual cancer burden to compare exceptional responders to incomplete and nonresponders. We assessed intratumoral heterogeneity at the tissue and genomic level, and compared the volume of residual disease to the Shannon diversity index for each tumor. We generated multivariate models of resistance based on three molecular features and one histologic feature, with and without multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging estimates of baseline tumor volume.  Results and limitations:   Loss of chromosome 10q (containing PTEN) and alterations to TP53 were predictive of poor response, as were the expression of nuclear ERG on IHC and the presence of intraductal carcinoma of the prostate. Patients with incompletely and nonresponding tumors harbored greater tumor diversity as estimated via phylogenetic tree reconstruction from DNA sequencing and analysis of IHC staining. Our four-factor binary model (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] 0.89) to predict poor response correlated with greater diversity in our cohort and a validation cohort of 57 Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas. When baseline tumor volume was added to the model, it distinguished poor response to NADT with an AUC of 0.98. Prospective use of this model requires further retrospective validation with biopsies from additional trials.  Conclusions:   A subset of prostate cancers exhibit greater histologic and genomic diversity at the time of diagnosis, and these localized tumors have greater fitness to resist therapy.  Patient summary:   Some prostate cancer tumors do not respond well to a hormonal treatment called androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). We used tumor volume and four other parameters to develop a model to identify tumors that will not respond well to ADT. Treatments other than ADT should be considered for these patients.""","""['Scott Wilkinson', 'Huihui Ye', 'Fatima Karzai', 'Stephanie A Harmon', 'Nicholas T Terrigino', 'David J VanderWeele', 'John R Bright', 'Rayann Atway', 'Shana Y Trostel', 'Nicole V Carrabba', 'Nichelle C Whitlock', 'Stephanie M Walker', 'Rosina T Lis', 'Houssein Abdul Sater', 'Brian J Capaldo', 'Ravi A Madan', 'James L Gulley', 'Guinevere Chun', 'Maria J Merino', 'Peter A Pinto', 'Daniela C Salles', 'Harsimar B Kaur', 'Tamara L Lotan', 'David J Venzon', 'Peter L Choyke', 'Baris Turkbey', 'William L Dahut', 'Adam G Sowalsky']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""[""Reply to Alessia Cimadamore, Liang Cheng, Antonio Lopez-Beltran, Marina Scarpelli, and Rodolfo Montironi's Letter to the Editor re: Scott Wilkinson, Huihui Ye, Fatima Karzai, et al.

Objective:   To evaluate the learning curve of an innovative ""3-port"" LRP for PCa patients.  Methods:   206 patients who received ""3-port"" LRP were retrospectively reviewed between January 2016 and December 2019 at our institution. According to the different years of operations performed, all of the patients were divided into group A (No. 1-50), group B (No. 51-107), group C (No. 108-160), and group D (No. 161-206). A learning curve was depicted by analyzing the parameters of operative time (OT), estimated blood loss (EBL), hospitalization, and drainage indwelling days.  Results:   All groups were comparable with regard to the preoperative characteristics (p > 0.05). The sloping learning curve for the surgeon showed that OT and EBL were strongly correlated with an accumulated experience when compared between group A and the other groups (p < 0.05), denoting that the surgical skill of the ""3-port"" LRP can be fully mastered after around 50 cases. Although no significant correlation with additional experience was observed in the hospitalization and drainage indwelling days among groups, a tendency towards less hospitalization and drainage indwelling days was still reflected.  Conclusions:   Our 4-year analysis based on a single-center experience exhibits that the innovative ""3-port"" LRP appears to be favorable with decreasing tendency in OT and EBL with experience accumulation.

To determine whether expression of these two inflammation-related proteins affect prostate cancer susceptibility, dual immunostaining of benign prostate biopsies for GDF-15 and NF-κB was done in a study of 503 case-control pairs matched on date, age, and race, nested within a historical cohort of 10,478 men. GDF-15 and NF-κB expression levels were positively correlated (r = 0.39; p < 0.0001), and both were significantly lower in African American (AA) compared with White men. In adjusted models that included both markers, the odds ratio (OR) for NF-κB expression was statistically significant, OR =0.87; p = 0.03; 95% confidence interval (CI) =0.77-0.99, while GDF-15 expression was associated with a nominally increased risk, OR =1.06; p = 0.27; 95% CI =0.96-1.17.

Risk associated with GDF-15 expression was best fit using nonlinear regression modeling where both first (p = 0.02) and second (p = 0.03) order GDF-15 risk terms were associated with significantly increased risk. This modeling approach also revealed significantly increased risk associated with GDF-15 expression for subsamples defined by AA race, aggressive disease, younger age, and in case-control pairs with longer follow-up.

Recent studies revealed that circular RNAs (circRNAs) can be involved in cancer metastasis. Defining the role of circRNAs in prostate cancer metastasis and discovering therapeutic targets that block cancer metastasis is of great significance for the treatment of prostate cancer.  Methods:   The circSOBP levels in prostate cancer (PCa) were determined by qRT-PCR. We evaluated the function of circSOBP using a transwell assay and nude mice lung metastasis models. Immunofluorescence assay and electron microscopic assay were applied to determine the phenotypes of prostate cancer cells' migration. We used fluorescence in situ hybridization assay to determine the localization of RNAs. Dual luciferase and rescue assays were applied to verify the interactions between circSOBP, miR-141-3p, MYPT1, and phosphomyosin light chain (p-MLC2).  Results:   We observed that circSOBP level was significantly lower in PCa specimens compared with adjacent noncancerous prostate specimens, and was correlated with the grade group of PCa. Overexpression of circSOBP suppressed PCa migration and invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo. CircSOBP depletion increased migration and invasion and induced amoeboid migration of PCa cells. Mechanistically, circSOBP bound miR-141-3p and regulated the MYPT1/p-MLC2 axis. Moreover, the depletion of MYPT1 reversed the inhibitory effect of circSOBP on the migration and invasion of PCa cells. Complementary intronic Alu elements induced but were not necessary for the formation of circSOBP. The nuclear export of circSOBP was mediated by URH49.

A concurrent mixed-methods design was used with participants (N = 396) recruited from different parts of the country. The grounded theory method of analysis was used for qualitative data and a logistic regression was used to explain the relationship between screening intentionality and PCa knowledge and family history. Qualitative results indicated that subjective PCa knowledge between the three subgroups was relatively similar but differed based on whether a person knew a family member or friend who had been affected by the disease. Themes focused on risk, PCa education, screening, and impact on sexuality. Quantitatively, result revealed that there are ethnic differences in knowledge across the three subgroups.

Methods:   Fifty-two mCRPC patients who received at least six cycles of DTX as the first-line treatment following 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT were enrolled in this retrospective study. Total PSMA-derived tumor volume (TV-PSMA) and total lesion PSMA activity (TL-PSMA) were derived from metastatic lesions. A ≥ 50% decline in PSA was defined as a response; a ≥ 25% increase in PSA was defined as progression. Univariate/multivariate logistic and cox regression analyses were performed to predict PSA response, OS, and TTP.  Results:   Twelve (23%) patients had PSA progression after chemotherapy, while 40 patients (77%) achieved a PSA response. On univariate analysis, a significant association was found between TV-PSMA (p = 0.001), TL-PSMA (p = 0.001), pre-PSA (p = 0.012), LDH (p = 0.003), Hg (p = 0.035), and PSA response to DTX.

The median TTP was 16 months, and the median OS was not reached. Patients with high TV-PSMA (p = 0.017), high TL-PSMA (> 1013 cm3) (p = 0.042), high age (> 70 years) (p = 0.016), and high LDH (p ≤ 0.001) had significantly shorter OS, while only high TV-PSMA (p = 0.038) and high age (p = 0.006) were significantly related with shorter TTP.

Methods:   We identified adults diagnosed with eight common cancers from 2009 to 2014 from the California Cancer Registry and followed them through 2017 (8 years maximum). We calculated person-year mortality rates by race/ethnicity and SES. Adjusted hazard ratios for the association between overall mortality and race/ethnicity and SES were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models accounting for other demographics, stage at diagnosis, and cancer treatments.  Results:   A total of 164,197 adults were diagnosed with cancer originating from breast, prostate, lung, colon, skin melanoma, uterus, kidney, and bladder. For all race/ethnic groups combined, the mortality rates from lowest to highest SES groups were 112.1/1000 PY (lowest); 100.2/1000 PY (lower-middle); 91.2/1000 PY (middle); 79.1/1000 PY (upper-middle); and 63.5/1000 PY (upper). These rates suggest that person with lowest SES have a markedly increased mortality risk after cancer diagnosis even if they have health insurance. In multivariable analyses, those in the lowest SES group had a 40-78% increased risk of all-cause mortality compared to those in the upper SES group across all race/ethnicities. For example, within African Americans, the adjusted mortality risk was up to 61% higher (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.41-1.83) in the lowest SES group compared to the highest SES group.  Conclusion:   This study suggests disparities in overall mortality risk after cancer diagnoses persist even in a cohort with health insurance, and that SES is an important driver of this disparity.""","""['Robert M Cooper', 'Joanie Chung', 'Tiffany Hogan', 'Reina Haque']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['Disparities in race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status: risk of mortality of breast cancer patients in the California Cancer Registry, 2000-2010.', 'Investigating Mortality Disparities Among Insured Patients With Colon Cancer Treated in an Integrated Health care System and Other Private Settings.', 'Age-related differences in breast cancer mortality according to race/ethnicity, insurance, and socioeconomic status.', 'Cancer survival disparities by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status in New Jersey.', 'Socioeconomic factors and breast carcinoma in multicultural women.', 'Integration of lncRNAs, Protein-Coding Genes and Pathology Images for Detecting Metastatic Melanoma.']"""

Methods:   In this IRB exempt study, initial pilot data comparing filling time of glass and plastic containers in an ex vivo setting under identical conditions revealed power calculations that n = 37 patients per group would be needed to achieve standard deviation (SD) = 60 s, difference (diff) = 40 s, two-tailed alpha-level 0.05, and power 80%. Total of 43 patients (93 containers) were enrolled and randomized to glass or plastic bottles at enrollment. Timing of bottle filling was assessed using standardized sonographic screen captures.  Results:   An interim look at statistics at n = 20 patients indicated that original conjectures from pilot data were conservative and smaller sample size was sufficient to stop the study and conduct the analyses. Specifically, SD = 54 s, diff = 49 s, two-tailed alpha-level 0.05, and power 80% required n = 21 patients per group. Plastic containers had a statistically significantly lower average filling time per bottle (162.7 ± 53.3 s) compared to glass (212.2 ± 50.4 s) (p = 0.003). Viscosity was calculated for each specimen and did not affect the statistical significance of the results (p = 0.32).  Conclusion:   Plastic containers have 50 s time savings of per bottle filling time as compared to glass bottles as theorized based on their faster flow rate. This holds true in both an ex vivo setting and in patients and can have important downstream impacts on patient throughput, provider efficiency and system wide cost savings.""","""['William P Perry', 'Joshua J Barrett', 'Michelle Secic', 'Wendy L Ehieli', 'Richard A Leder', 'Daniele Marin', 'Rendon C Nelson', 'Rajan T Gupta']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Abdom Radiol (NY)""","""['Wall suction-assisted image-guided therapeutic paracentesis: a safe and less expensive alternative to evacuated bottles.', 'Diagnostic Concordance of Telemedicine as Compared With Face-to-Face Care in Primary Health Care Clinics in Rural India: Randomized Crossover Trial.', 'Bottles to trees: Plastic beverage bottles as an alternative nursery growing container for reforestation in developing countries.', 'NTP Research Report on the CLARITY-BPA Core Study: A Perinatal and Chronic Extended-Dose-Range Study of Bisphenol A in Rats: Research Report 9 Internet.', 'Development of injection containers for patient and medical staff.']"""

Understanding cell and molecular mechanisms determining fraction size sensitivity is essential to fully exploit this therapeutic variable for patient benefit. The hypothesis under test in this study is that fraction size sensitivity is dependent on the presence of wild-type (WT) p53 and intact non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Using single or split-doses of radiation in a range of normal and malignant cells, split-dose recovery was determined using colony-survival assays. Both normal and tumour cells with WT p53 demonstrated significant split-dose recovery, whereas Li-Fraumeni fibroblasts and tumour cells with defective G1/S checkpoint had a large S/G2 component and lost the sparing effect of smaller fractions. There was lack of split-dose recovery in NHEJ-deficient cells and DNA-PKcs inhibitor increased sensitivity to split-doses in glioma cells. Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of p53 in fibroblasts reduced split-dose recovery. In summary, cells defective in p53 are less sensitive to radiotherapy fraction size and lack of split-dose recovery in DNA ligase IV and DNA-PKcs mutant cells suggests the dependence of fraction size sensitivity on intact NHEJ.""","""['Selvakumar Anbalagan', 'Cecilia Ström', 'Jessica A Downs', 'Penny A Jeggo', 'David McBay', 'Anna Wilkins', 'Kai Rothkamm', 'Kevin J Harrington', 'John R Yarnold', 'Navita Somaiah']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Suppression of NF-kappaB activity by parthenolide induces X-ray sensitivity through inhibition of split-dose repair in TP53 null prostate cancer cells.', 'Proficiency in homologous recombination repair is prerequisite for activation of G2-checkpoint at low radiation doses.', 'Genetic evidence for the involvement of DNA ligase IV in the DNA-PK-dependent pathway of non-homologous end joining in mammalian cells.', 'Roles for 53BP1 in the repair of radiation-induced DNA double strand breaks.', 'Mechanisms of DNA double strand break repair and chromosome aberration formation.', 'Identification of an individualized therapy prognostic signature for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'p53 Modulates Radiosensitivity in Head and Neck Cancers-From Classic to Future Horizons.', 'Efficacy and Safety of Temozolomide Combined with Radiotherapy in the Treatment of Malignant Glioma.', 'Radiotherapy of High-Grade Gliomas: First Half of 2021 Update with Special Reference to Radiosensitization Studies.']"""

However, most of these studies are not conducted in a randomized controlled fashion, thus limiting their scientific value. A recent prospective, randomized, controlled trial (RCT) did not show superiority of a peritoneal flap while further trials are lacking. Therefore, the aim of the presented RCT will be to show that creating a peritoneal flap decreases the rate of symptomatic lymphoceles compared to the current standard procedure without creation of a flap.  Methods/design:   PELYCAN is a parallel-group, patient- and assessor-blinded, phase III, adaptive randomized controlled superiority trial. Men with histologically confirmed prostate cancer who undergo transperitoneal RARP with pelvic LND will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to two groups-either with creating a peritoneal flap (PELYCAN) or without creating a peritoneal flap (control). Sample size calculation yielded a sample size of 300 with a planned interim analysis after 120 patients, which will be performed by an independent statistician. This provides a possibility for early stopping or sample size recalculation. Patients will be stratified for contributing factors for the development of postoperative lymphoceles. The primary outcome measure will be the rate of symptomatic lymphoceles in both groups within 6 months postoperatively. Patients and assessors will be blinded for the intervention until the end of the follow-up period of 6 months. The surgeon will be informed about the randomization result after performance of vesicourethral anastomosis. Secondary outcome measures include asymptomatic lymphoceles at the time of discharge and within 6 months of follow-up, postoperative complications, mortality, re-admission rate, and quality of life assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire.  Discussion:   The PELYCAN study is designed to assess whether the application of a peritoneal flap during RARP reduces the rate of symptomatic lymphoceles, as compared with the standard operation technique. In case of superiority of the intervention, this peritoneal flap may be suggested as a new standard of care.  Trial registration:   German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00016794 .

We aimed to develop an automated computed tomography (CT)-based multi-organ (bladder, prostate, rectum, left and right femoral heads (RFHs)) segmentation method for prostate radiation therapy treatment planning. The proposed method uses synthetic MRIs (sMRIs) to offer superior soft-tissue information for male pelvic CT images. Cycle-consistent adversarial networks (CycleGAN) were used to generate CT-based sMRIs. Dual pyramid networks (DPNs) extracted features from both CTs and sMRIs. A deep attention strategy was integrated into the DPNs to select the most relevant features from both CTs and sMRIs to identify organ boundaries. The CT-based sMRI generated from our previously trained CycleGAN and its corresponding CT images were inputted to the proposed DPNs to provide complementary information for pelvic multi-organ segmentation. The proposed method was trained and evaluated using datasets from 140 patients with prostate cancer, and were then compared against state-of-art methods. The Dice similarity coefficients and mean surface distances between our results and ground truth were 0.95 ± 0.05, 1.16 ± 0.70 mm; 0.88 ± 0.08, 1.64 ± 1.26 mm; 0.90 ± 0.04, 1.27 ± 0.48 mm; 0.95 ± 0.04, 1.08 ± 1.29 mm; and 0.95 ± 0.04, 1.11 ± 1.49 mm for bladder, prostate, rectum, left and RFHs, respectively. Mean center of mass distances was within 3 mm for all organs. Our results performed significantly better than those of competing methods in most evaluation metrics. We demonstrated the feasibility of sMRI-aided DPNs for multi-organ segmentation on pelvic CT images, and its superiority over other networks.

Recently, ISUP experts published a consensus definition of cribriform pattern highlighting criteria that distinguish it from mimickers. The current study aimed to analyze morphologic features separately to identify those that define the essence of the cribriform pattern. Thirty-two selected photomicrographs were classified by 12 urologic pathologists as: definitely cribriform cancer, probably cribriform, unsure, probably not cribriform, or definitely not cribriform. Consensus was defined as 9/12 agree or disagree, with ≤1 strongly supporting the opposite choice. Final consensus was achieved in 21 of 32 cases. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) model with logit link was fitted to estimate effect of multiple morphologic predictors. Fisher exact test was used for categorical findings. Presence of intervening stroma precluded calling cribriform cancer (p = 0.006). Mucin presence detracted (p = 0.003) from willingness to call cribriform cancer (only 3 cases had mucin). Lumen number was associated with cribriform consensus (p = 0.0006), and all consensus cases had ≥9 lumens. Predominant papillary pattern or an irregular outer boundary detracted (p = NS). Invasive cribriform carcinoma should have absence of intervening stroma, and usually neither papillary pattern, irregular outer boundary, nor very few lumens.

The prostate cancer patients undergoing standard androgen deprivation therapy eventually develop castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) for which there is no effective treatment currently available, and the hub genes involved in this process remain unclear.  Objective:   To study prostate cancer systematically and comprehensively.  Methods:   Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of prostate cancer were screened in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed. Connectivity Map (Cmap) software was applied to discover potential treatment drugs. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis was performed to obtained the hub genes, and the relationship between hub genes and immune cell infiltration was investigated. Next, RNAseq data of hormone-sensitive prostate cancer samples and CRPC samples obtained from TCGA database was further analyzed to identify DEGs. Finally, a PPI analysis was performed to obtain the hub genes.  Results:   A total of 319 DEGs were identified between prostate cancer samples and normal adjacent samples from TCGA database using comparative analysis. The KEGG pathway analysis showed significant correlations with drug metabolism, metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, and chemical carcinogenesis. AMACR, FOLH1 and NPY, three hub genes, were found to be upregulated. FOLH1 was positively correlated with CD8+ T cell infiltration. FOLH1, AMACR, and NPY were negatively correlated with CD4+ T cell infiltration. A total of 426 DEGs were identified from RNAseq data of hormone-sensitive prostate cancer samples and CRPC samples using further comparative analysis. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed significant correlations with arachidonic acid metabolism, PPAR signaling pathway, AMPK signaling pathway, and metabolic pathways. The top 10 hub genes in PPI network were screened out, including PPARG, SREBF1, SCD, HMGCR, FASN, PTGS2, HMGCS2, SREBF2, FDFT1, and INSIG1. Among them, SCD and FASN are expected to be the potential therapeutic targets for CRPC.  Conclusions:   AMACR, FOLH1 and NPY may be effective therapeutic targets and specific diagnostic markers for prostate cancer. AMACR, FOLH1, and NPY are also closely associated with immune cell infiltration in prostate cancer. Moreover, aminoglutethimide and resveratrol were found to be the promising drugs for treating prostate cancer. The progression of hormone-sensitive prostate cancer to CRPC may be related to arachidonic acid metabolism, PPAR signaling pathway, AMPK signaling pathway, and other metabolic pathways.

Results:   We successfully sequenced circulating tumor DNA from 109 blood samples and 29 metastatic tissue samples from 129 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer). We observed distinct genomic profiles of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer across various metastatic sites. High prevalence of PTEN alteration was found in viscerally metastatic prostate cancer compared with bone-only metastatic prostate cancer (PTEN, 9.09% vs 2.08%, p=0.105). When comparing viscerally metastatic prostate cancer according to the metastatic sites, AR alteration rarely occurs in hepatically metastatic prostate cancer, which stood in great contrast to the high alteration frequency in hepatically metastatic prostate cancer (0.0% vs 42.1%, p=0.01). For overall DNA damage response alteration, the highest frequency was found in hepatically metastatic prostate cancer (63.2%).  Conclusions:   Through genomic profiling of prostate cancer across various metastatic sites, we identified an extremely low frequency of AR alterations in pulmonarily metastatic prostate cancer without liver involvement, high prevalence of DNA damage response pathway deficiency in hepatically metastatic prostate cancer and high PTEN alteration rates in viscerally metastatic prostate cancer. We discovered the genomic diversity among bone-only metastatic prostate cancer, hepatically metastatic prostate cancer and pulmonarily metastatic prostate cancer without liver involvement. Our findings shed new light on the heterogenous prognosis in visceral metastases and hint at potential therapeutic targets in both hepatically metastatic prostate cancer and pulmonarily metastatic prostate cancer without liver involvement.""","""['Yiming Gong', 'Liancheng Fan', 'Xiaochen Fei', 'Yinjie Zhu', 'Xinxing Du', 'Yuman He', 'Jiahua Pan', 'Baijun Dong', 'Wei Xue']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Concordance of Circulating Tumor DNA and Matched Metastatic Tissue Biopsy in Prostate Cancer.', 'Comparative Analysis of Genomic Alterations across Castration Sensitive and Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer via Circulating Tumor DNA Sequencing.', 'Immunohistochemistry-based assessment of androgen receptor status and the AR-null phenotype in metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer.', 'Molecular pathology of prostate cancer.', 'Lineage plasticity in cancer: a shared pathway of therapeutic resistance.', 'Cell-free DNA in the management of prostate cancer: Current status and future prospective.']"""

IRF5 protein function is irregular in various human cancers, and its role in prostate cancer is also unknown. This study presents the first evidence that IRF5 expression is controlled with androgen receptor (AR) signalling interaction and stem cell factors (Nanog, Oct4, Sox2) in prostate cancer. Human prostate cancer cell lines (PC3, DU145 and LNCaP) were transfected plasmids and assessed for cellular localization of IRF5 and AR interaction with IF-staining. Co-immunoprecipitation and ChIP assay were used to detect the IRF5 and AR protein-protein interaction and IRF5 stem cell factors protein-gene interaction. The target relation between IRF5, AR, CREB, p300, ISRE, ARE and NF-кB was tested by luciferase assay. IRF5 was low expressed in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells and tissues. The analysis of human prostate cancer clinical samples supports the interaction of IRF5 and AR in a pathological role, as IRF5 expression is down-regulated in the tumours' advanced stages. Tumour suppression mechanism of IRF5 and SOX2 levels in cells reduces and causes AR acetylation. Those affect the prostate cancer mechanism by modifying the cellular response in the signal pathway.

The impacts of proposed alternatives on reducing infection risk are unknown.  Objective:   To investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with the risks and benefits of standard radiation therapy (RT).  Design, setting, and participants:   This comparative effectiveness study used estimated individual patient-level data extracted from published Kaplan-Meier survival figures from 8 randomized clinical trials across oncology from 1993 to 2014 that evaluated the inclusion of RT or compared different RT fractionation regimens. Included trials were Dutch TME and TROG 01.04 examining rectal cancer; CALGB 9343, OCOG hypofractionation trial, FAST-Forward, and NSABP B-39 examining early stage breast cancer, and CHHiP and HYPO-RT-PC examining prostate cancer. Risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality associated with receipt of RT in the treatment arms were simulated and trials were reanalyzed. Data were analyzed between April 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020.  Exposures:   COVID-19 risk associated with treatment was simulated across different pandemic scenarios, varying infection risk per fractions (IRFs) and case fatality rates (CFRs).  Main outcomes and measures:   Overall survival was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards modeling under different pandemic scenarios.  Results:   Estimated IPLD from a total of 14 170 patients were included in the simulations. In scenarios with low COVID-19-associated risks (IRF, 0.5%; CFR, 5%), fractionation was not significantly associated with outcomes. In locally advanced rectal cancer, short-course RT was associated with better outcomes than long-course chemoradiation (TROG 01.04) and was associated with similar outcomes as RT omission (Dutch TME) in most settings (eg, TROG 01.04 median HR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.46-0.96]; Dutch TME median HR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.80-1.03] in a scenario with IRF 5% and CFR 20%). Moderate hypofractionation in early stage breast cancer (OCOG hypofractionation trial) and prostate cancer (CHHiP) was not associated with survival benefits in the setting of COVID-19 (eg, OCOG hypofractionation trial median HR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.74-1.06]; CHHiP median HR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.75-1.01] under high-risk scenario with IRF 10% and CFR 30%). More aggressive hypofractionation (FAST-Forward, HYPO-RT-PC) and accelerated partial breast irradiation (NSABP B-39) were associated with improved survival in higher risk scenarios (eg, FAST-Forward median HR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.49-0.68]; HYPO-RT-PC median HR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.48-0.75] under scenario with IRF 10% and CFR 30%).  Conclusions and relevance:   In this comparative effectiveness study of data from 8 clinical trials of patients receiving radiation therapy to simulate COVID-19 risk and mortality rates, treatment modification was not associated with altered risk from COVID-19 in lower-risk scenarios and was only associated with decreased mortality in very high COVID-19-risk scenarios. This model, which can be adapted to dynamic changes in COVID-19 risk, provides a flexible, quantitative approach to assess the potential impact of treatment modifications and supports the continued delivery of standard evidence-based care with appropriate precautions against COVID-19.""","""['Shervin Tabrizi', 'Lorenzo Trippa', 'Daniel Cagney', 'Ayal A Aizer', 'Shyam Tanguturi', 'Steffen Ventz', 'Geoffrey Fell', 'Jennifer R Bellon', 'Harvey Mamon', 'Paul L Nguyen', ""Anthony V D'Amico"", 'Daphne Haas-Kogan', 'Brian M Alexander', 'Rifaquat Rahman']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['A Modeling Approach to Radiation Therapy in the Era of COVID-19.', 'Ultra-hypofractionated versus conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: 5-year outcomes of the HYPO-RT-PC randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial.', 'Conventional Versus Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer: A Meta-analysis of Randomized Noninferiority Trials.', 'Breast, Prostate, and Rectal Cancer: Should 5-5-5 Be a New Standard of Care?', 'Management of prostate cancer radiotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic: A necessary paradigm change.', 'Moderate hypofractionation remains the standard of care for whole-breast radiotherapy in breast cancer: Considerations regarding FAST and FAST-Forward.', 'Covid-19 and radiotherapy: a systematic review after 2 years of pandemic.']"""

Using cancer cells in culture in the absence of key nutrients, we have explored the roles of two potential survival mechanisms, autophagy and elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K), which, when activated, inhibits the resource-intensive elongation stage of protein synthesis. Both processes are regulated through the nutrient-sensitive AMP-activated protein kinase and mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 signalling pathways. We find that disabling both autophagy and eEF2K strongly compromises the survival of nutrient-deprived lung and breast cancer cells, whereas, for example, knocking out eEF2K alone has little effect. Contrary to some earlier reports, we find no evidence that eEF2K regulates autophagy. Unexpectedly, eEF2K does not facilitate survival of prostate cancer PC3 cells. Thus, eEF2K and autophagy enable survival of certain cell-types in a mutually complementary manner. To explore this further, we generated, by selection, cells which were able to survive nutrient starvation even when autophagy and eEF2K were disabled. Proteome profiling using mass spectrometry revealed that these 'resistant' cells showed lower levels of diverse proteins which are required for energy-consuming processes such as protein and fatty acid synthesis, although different clones of 'resistant cells' appear to adapt in dissimilar ways. Our data provide further information of the ways that human cells cope with nutrient limitation and to understanding of the utility of eEF2K as a potential target in oncology.""","""['Roman V Lenchine', 'Sushma R Rao', 'Xuemin Wang', 'Danielle Meiwen Fang', 'Christopher G Proud']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Biochem J""","""['Elongation factor 2 kinase promotes cell survival by inhibiting protein synthesis without inducing autophagy.', 'Silencing of EEF2K (eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase) reveals AMPK-ULK1-dependent autophagy in colon cancer cells.', 'Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) kinase/eEF2 plays protective roles against glucose deprivation-induced cell death in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts.', 'Eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase (eEF2K) signaling in tumor and microenvironment as a novel molecular target.', 'Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase confers tolerance to stress conditions in cancer cells.', 'Identification of an Autophagy-Related Signature Based on Whole Bone Marrow Sequencing for the Prognosis and Immune Microenvironment Characterization of Multiple Myeloma.']"""

The existence of such an effect in cancer care, where it would be most likely to reduce mortality, has been unclear.  Methods:   Patients aged 61 to 69 years who were diagnosed with lung, breast, colon, or prostate cancer from 2004 to 2016 were identified with the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database and were dichotomized on the basis of eligibility for Medicare (61-64 vs 65-69 years). With age-over-age (AoA) percent change calculations, trends in cancer diagnoses and staging were characterized. After matching, uninsured patients who were 61 to 64 years old (pre-Medicare group) were compared with insured patients who were 65 to 69 years old (post-Medicare group) with respect to cancer-specific mortality.  Results:   In all, 134,991 patients were identified with lung cancer, 175,558 were identified with breast cancer, 62,721 were identified with colon cancer, and 238,823 were identified with prostate cancer. The AoA growth in the number of cancer diagnoses was highest at the age of 65 years in comparison with all other ages within the decade for all 4 cancers (P < .01, P < .001, P < .01, and P < .001, respectively). In a comparison of diagnoses at the age of 65 years with those in the 61- to 64-year-old cohort, the greatest difference for all 4 cancers was seen in stage I. In matched analyses, the 5-year cancer-specific mortality was worse for lung (86.3% vs 78.5%; P < .001), breast (32.7% vs 11.0%; P < .001), colon (57.1% vs 35.6%; P < .001), and prostate cancer (16.9% vs 4.8%; P < .001) in the uninsured pre-Medicare group than the insured post-Medicare group.  Conclusions:   The age threshold of 65 years for Medicare eligibility is associated with more cancer diagnoses (particularly stage I), and this results in lower long-term cancer-specific mortality for all cancers studied.

Materials and methods:   This retrospective study assessed the biparametric MRI findings in men who opted for EBRT from January 2018 to June 2019 (n = 79; mean age, 67.9 years ± 6.2 [standard deviation]). Serum prostate-specific antigen level, digital rectal examination findings, histologic grade group (GG) from transrectal US-guided biopsy, prior androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), and any prior CT results were used to stratify patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk categories. Risk-group stratification prior to MRI separated patients into low- (seven of 79 [8.9%]), intermediate- (36 of 79 [45.6%]) and high-risk (36 of 79 [45.6%]) groups. Following MRI, any risk group (low, intermediate, high, nodal involvement, and metastatic disease) or oncologic management changes were recorded. Multivariable binary logistic regression analyses were used to assess predictor of upgrade status, with adjustment for demographic covariates jointly.  Results:   Following MRI, 30 of 79 (38.0%) patients had risk-group upshifts compared with their original assessment. Patients were recategorized into low risk (one of 79, 1.3%), intermediate risk (19 of 79, 24.1%), high risk (51 of 79, 64.6%), nodal involvement (one of 79, 1.3%), and metastatic disease (seven of 79, 8.9%). From the original groupings, there were six of seven (85.7%) from the low group, 18 of 36 (50.0%) from the intermediate group, and six of 36 (16.7%) from the high group that had risk group upward shifts. There was no association with GG: GG2 versus GG1, P = .53; GG3 versus GG1, P = .98; or prior ADT (P = .37) and the adjusted odds of risk-group upshifts. MRI findings resulted in treatment plan modification for 39 of 79 (49.4%) men overall.  Conclusion:   Prostate MRI should be considered for patients in high-risk populations prior to EBRT because upstaging from MR image assessment may have implications for modification of treatment.Keywords: MR-Imaging, Prostate, Radiation Therapy© RSNA, 2020See the commentary by Davenport and Shankar in this issue.""","""['Maria A Gosein', 'Dylan Narinesingh', 'Shastri Motilal', 'Adrian P Ramkissoon', 'Cristal M Goetz', 'Kristy Sadho', 'Murrie D Mosodeen', 'Renee Banfield']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Radiol Imaging Cancer""","""['Biparametric Prostate MRI Influencing Care Patterns in a Caribbean Population.', 'The need for androgen deprivation therapy in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with dose-escalated external beam radiation therapy.', 'In-Bore MRI-guided Prostate Biopsies in Patients with Prior Positive Transrectal US-guided Biopsy Results: Pathologic Outcomes and Predictors of Missed Cancers.', 'Abbreviated Biparametric Prostate MR Imaging in Men with Elevated Prostate-specific Antigen.', 'Prostate Cancer Genomic Classifier Relates More Strongly to Gleason Grade Group Than Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Score in Multiparametric Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging-ultrasound Fusion Targeted Biopsies.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.']"""

MicroRNA (miR)-217 and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) have been reported to play significant roles in different types of cancer, such as osteosarcoma and prostate cancer; however, the association between miR-217 and SIRT1 in the cell proliferation, apoptosis and invasion of NSCLC remain unknown. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the roles of miR-217 and SIRT1 in NSCLC. The expression levels of miR-217 and SIRT1 were detected via reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-q)PCR and western blot analyses. The effect of miR-217 on A549 and H1299 cell proliferation, apoptosis and invasion was assessed via the Cell Counting Kit-8, flow cytometry and Transwell assays, respectively. In addition, the association between SIRT1 and miR-217 was predicted using the TargetScan database, and verified via the dual-luciferase reporter assay, and RT-qPCR and western blot analyses. The results demonstrated that miR-217 expression was significantly downregulated, while SIRT1 expression was significantly upregulated in A549 and H1299 cells compared with the human bronchial epithelial cells. Furthermore, transfection with miR-217 mimic significantly inhibited A549 and H1299 cell proliferation and invasion, and induced A549 and H1299 cell apoptosis. The results of the dual-luciferase reporter assay and western blot analysis confirmed that SIRT1 is a target gene of miR-217. In addition, miR-217 inhibited the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mTOR signaling. Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that miR-217 inhibits A549 and H1299 cell proliferation and invasion, and induces A549 and H1299 cell apoptosis by targeting SIRT1 and inactivating the SIRT1-mediated AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway.

Aptamer-targeted indocyanine green (ICG)-nanoparticles can enhance near-infrared fluorescent imaging of pancreatic and prostate tumors and could improve early cancer detection. This project explored whether calcium-phosphosilicate nanoparticles, also known as NanoJackets (NJs), that were bioconjugated with a tumor-specific targeting DNA aptamer could improve the non-invasive detection of pancreatic and prostate tumors.  Methods:   Using in vivo near-infrared optical imaging and ex vivo fluorescence analysis, DNA aptamer-targeted ICG-loaded NJs were compared to untargeted NJs for detection of tumors.  Results:   Nanoparticles were bioconjugated with the DNA aptamer AP1153, which binds to the CCK-B receptor (CCKBR). Aptamer bioconjugated NJs were not significantly increased in size compared with unconjugated nanoparticles. AP1153-ICG-NJ accumulation in orthotopic pancreatic tumors peaked at 18 h post-injection and the ICG signal was cleared by 36 h with no evidence on uptake by non-tumor tissues. Ex vivo tumor imaging confirmed the aptamer-targeted NJs accumulated to higher levels than untargeted NJs, were not taken up by normal pancreas, exited from the tumor vasculature, and were well-dispersed throughout pancreatic and prostate tumors despite extensive fibrosis. Specificity for AP1153-NJ binding to the CCK-B receptor on pancreatic tumor cells was confirmed by pre-treating tumor-bearing mice with the CCK receptor antagonist proglumide. Proglumide pre-treatment reduced the in vivo tumoral accumulation of AP1153-NJs to levels comparable to that of untargeted NJs.  Conclusion:   Through specific interactions with CCK-B receptors, tumor-targeted nanoparticles containing either ICG or rhodamine WT were well distributed throughout the matrix of both pancreatic and prostate tumors. Tumor-targeted NJs carrying various imaging agents can enhance tumor detection.""","""['Thomas Abraham', 'Christopher O McGovern', 'Samuel S Linton', 'Zachary Wilczynski', 'James H Adair', 'Gail L Matters']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Nanomedicine""","""['Targeted Nanobubbles Carrying Indocyanine Green for Ultrasound, Photoacoustic and Fluorescence Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', 'A Cholecystokinin B Receptor-Specific DNA Aptamer for Targeting Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.', 'Targeted indocyanine-green-loaded calcium phosphosilicate nanoparticles for in vivo photodynamic therapy of leukemia.', 'Bioconjugation of calcium phosphosilicate composite nanoparticles for selective targeting of human breast and pancreatic cancers in vivo.', 'NIR fluorescence-guided tumor surgery: new strategies for the use of indocyanine green.', 'Aptamers as Smart Ligands for Targeted Drug Delivery in Cancer Therapy.', 'Aptamers used for molecular imaging and theranostics - recent developments.']"""

However, existing solutions for controlling this trade-off do not guarantee corresponding improvements in deliverability. Therefore, this work explored the feasibility of an optimization framework for directly maximizing predicted QA outcomes of plans without compromising the dosimetric quality of plans designed with an established knowledge-based planning (KBP) technique.  Materials and methods:   A support vector machine (SVM) was developed - using a database of 500 previous VMAT plans - to predict gamma passing rates (GPRs; 3%/3mm percent dose-difference/distance-to-agreement with local normalization) based on selected complexity features. A heuristic, QA-based optimization (QAO) framework was devised by utilizing the SVM model to iteratively modify mechanical treatment features most commonly associated with suboptimal GPRs. Specifically, leaf gaps (LGs) <50 mm were widened by random amounts, which impacts all aperture-based complexity features. 13 prostate KBP-guided VMAT plans were optimized via QAO using user-specified maximum LG displacements before corresponding changes in predicted GPRs and dose were assessed.  Results:   Predicted GPRs increased by an average of 1.14 ± 1.25% (p = 0.006) with QAO using a 3 mm maximum random LG displacement. There were small differences in dose, resulting in similarly small changes in tumor control probability (maximum increase = 0.05%) and normal tissue complication probabilities in the bladder, rectum, and femoral heads (maximum decrease = 0.2% in the rectum).

We therefore sought to externally validate and compare all published mpMRI-based csCaP risk prediction models in an independent Asian population.  Patients and methods:   A total of 449 men undergoing combined transperineal fusion-targeted/systematic prostate biopsy at our specialist center between 2015 to 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. csCaP was defined as lesions with ISUP (International Society of Urological Pathology) grade group ≥2. The performance of 6 mpMRI-based risk models (MRI-ERSPC-3/4, Distler, Radtke, Mehralivand, van Leeuwen and He) were evaluated in terms of discrimination, calibration and clinical utility, using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration curves and decision curve analyses.  Results:   A total of 202 (45%) subjects were diagnosed with csCaP. All models demonstrated excellent accuracy with AUCs ranging from 0.75 to 0.86, and most significantly outperformed mpMRI PIRADSv2.0 (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2.0) alone. The models by Mehralivand and He showed good calibration to our validation population, with respective intercepts of -0.08 and -0.84. All models were nevertheless recalibrated to the csCaP prevalence in our population for analysis. Decision curve analysis showed that above a threshold probability of 10%, all mpMRI-based models demonstrated superior net benefit compared to mpMRI PIRADSv2.0 or a biopsy-all-men strategy. The van Leeuwen model had the greatest net benefit, avoiding 39% of unnecessary biopsies while missing only 4% of csCaP, at a threshold probability of 15%.  Conclusions:   The mpMRI-based risk models demonstrate excellent discrimination and clinical utility and are easy to apply in practice, suggesting that individualized risk-based approaches can be considered over mpMRI alone to avoid unnecessary biopsies.""","""['Han Jie Lee', 'Alvin Lee', 'Xin Yan Yang', 'Yan Mee Law', 'Hong Hong Huang', 'Weber Ko Lau', 'Lui Shiong Lee', 'Henry Ss Ho', 'Christopher Ws Cheng', 'John Sp Yuen', 'Kae Jack Tay', 'Kenneth Chen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['External validation of novel magnetic resonance imaging-based models for prostate cancer prediction.', 'A comparison of prostate cancer prediction models in men undergoing both magnetic resonance imaging and transperineal biopsy: Are the models still relevant?', 'Avoiding Unnecessary Biopsy: MRI-based Risk Models versus a PI-RADS and PSA Density Strategy for Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', 'Multivariate risk prediction tools including MRI for individualized biopsy decision in prostate cancer diagnosis: current status and future directions.', 'The primacy of multiparametric MRI in men with suspected prostate cancer.', 'External validation of two mpMRI-risk calculators predicting risk of prostate cancer before biopsy.', 'The Mount Sinai Prebiopsy Risk Calculator for Predicting any Prostate Cancer and Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: Development of a Risk Predictive Tool and Validation with Advanced Neural Networking, Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging Outcome Database, and European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator.']"""

The magnetic resonance-linac (MR-linac) is a new radiotherapy technology that combines imaging and treatment. Here we model the demand and demand variations for the MR-linac across England.  Materials and methods:   Initial clinical indications were provided by the MR-linac consortium and introduced into the Malthus radiotherapy clinical decision trees. The Malthus model contains Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) population, cancer incidence and stage presentation data (for lung and prostate) and simulated the demand for the MR-linac for all CCGs and Radiotherapy Operational Delivery Networks (RODN) across England.  Results:   Based on the initial target clinical indications, the MR-linac could service 16% of England's fraction burden. The simulated fractions/million population demand/annum varies between 3000 and 10 600 fractions/million at the CCG level. Focussing only on the cancer population, the simulated fractions/1000 cancer cases demand/annum ranges from 1028 to 1195 fractions/1000 cases. If a national average for fractions/million demand was then used, at the RODN level, the variation from actual annual demand ranges from an overestimation of 8400 fractions to an underestimation of 5800 fractions. When using the national average fractions/1000 cases, the RODN demand varies from an overestimation of 3200 fractions to an underestimation of 3000 fractions.

The popularity of mobile telecommunications has made it necessary to investigate the problem more comprehensively and cautiously assess the possible risks, because never before in history has such a substantial proportion of the population been exposed to microwaves at comparably high levels. Some studies indicate that the high frequency electromagnetic radiation emitted by mobile phone and Wi-Fi connections can have a negative effect on human health, and can cause cancer.  Objective:   The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of the radiofrquency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) on the metaboloc activity and morphology of normal human cells (fibroblasts) and cancer cells (prostate cancer cells).  Material and methods:   The cell cultures (human fibroblasts and prostate cancer cells) were exposed to RF-EMF at the frequency of 2.5 GHz for 24, 48 and 72h. To quantify changes in cell viability, the Cell Counting Kit - 8 was used.  Results:   It was found that the RF electromagnetic field exposure caused a significant decrease in the viability of fibroblasts, and a significant increase in cancer cells.

Bevezetés: Az utóbbi években az oligometastaticus prosztatadaganatok kezelése során a szisztémás kezelés mellett egyre gyakrabban végzik a primer tumor lokális kezelését is. Célkitűzés: A szerzők a tanulmányban a cytoreductiv radikális prostatectomia szerepét vizsgálták az oligometastaticus prosztatadaganatok kezelése során. Módszer: 2012. 01. 01. és 2019. 01. 01. között összesen hét betegben végeztek cytoreductiv radikális prostatectomiát oligometastaticus prosztatadaganat esetében. A betegek átlagos életkora 64 év, az átlagos PSA-koncentráció 43 ng/ml volt. Az áttétek száma minden beteg vonatkozásában maximum három volt, és valamennyi esetben csontáttét volt jelen. A betegek androgéndeprivatiós hormonkezelést kaptak, és közülük négy esetben már a műtét előtt elkezdték a hormonterápiát. Négy betegnél a csontmetastasisok miatt az áttétek sugárkezelése is megtörtént. Eredmények: A cytoreductiv prostatectomia szövettana öt esetben igazolt lokálisan előrehaladott (pT3) daganatot, és két alkalommal marginpozitivitás volt jelen. Emiatt öt beteg kapott adjuváns lokális irradiációt a metastasisok besugárzásán kívül. A műtétet követően biokémiai progresszió egy esetben jelentkezett. Ennek oka lokális recidíva volt, mely miatt a beteg 'salvage' irradiációt kapott. Az átlagosan 38 hónapos utánkövetés során új metastasist nem diagnosztizáltak, és tumor okozta halálozás nem fordult elő. Következtetés: A cytoreductiv prostatectomia oligometastaticus prosztatarákos betegek kezelésében - válogatott beteganyagon - megvalósítható lehetőség. Ugyanakkor a cytoreductiv prostatectomia előnyei a tumorprogresszió szempontjából még nem egyértelműek, ennek eldöntéséhez további vizsgálatok szükségesek. Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(13): 483-487.  Introduction:   In recent years, in addition to systemic therapy, local treatment of primary tumor has become increasingly common in the treatment of oligometastatic prostate cancers. Objectve: The authors measured the role of cytoreductive radical prostatectomy in the treatment of oligometastatic prostate carcinoma.  Methods:   From Janury 2012 to January 2019, they performed cytoreductive radical prostatectomy in seven patients with oligometastatic prostate cancer. The mean age of the patients was 64 years, and the mean PSA value was 43 ng/ml. The patients had maximum three distant metastases and all metastases were localized to the bones. The patients received androgene deprivation therapy and this treatment was started before the surgery in four cases. Irradiation of the bone metastasis was performed in four cases.  Results:   The histology of the cytoreductive radical prostatectomy showed locally advanced tumor (pT3) in five patients and margin-positive status was present in two cases. Hence, adjuvant irradiation was administered locally in five patients in addition to the irradiation of bone metastases. Biochemical progression was detected in one patient during the follow-up period. It was caused by local recurrence of the tumor and the patient was treated with salvage irradiation. During the 38 months follow-up period neither new distant metastasis nor cancer-related mortality was detected.  Conclusion:   The cytoreductive radical prostatectomy is a feasible option in selected cases with oligometastatic prostate cancer. However, the benefits of cytoreductive radical prostatectomy regarding tumor progression are not clear yet and further studies are required.

Loneliness was associated with total cancer incidence after adjustments for tested lifestyle and health-related covariates. Social Isolation was associated with total cancer incidence, except when adjusted for lifestyle, diet, or Human Population Laboratory (HPL) Depression Scale scores. Loneliness was associated with lung cancer incidence, except when adjusted for HPL Depression Scale scores. There was no significant association between social isolation and lung cancer.

Methods:   Our study population consisted of men without histories of prostate cancer, BPH-related outcomes, or nocturia in the intervention arm of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) (n = 4710). Associations for body size in early- (age 20), mid- (age 50) and late-life (age ≥ 55, mean age 60.7 years) and weight change with incident BPH-related outcomes (including self-reported nocturia and physician diagnosis of BPH, digital rectal examination-estimated prostate volume ≥ 30 cc, and prostate-specific antigen [PSA] concentration > 1.4 ng/mL) were examined using Poisson regression with robust variance estimation.  Results:   Men who were obese in late-life were 25% more likely to report nocturia (Relative Risk (RR): 1.25, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.11-1.40; p-trendfor continuous BMI < 0.0001) and men who were either overweight or obese in late-life were more likely to report a prostate volume ≥ 30 cc (RRoverweight: 1.13, 95% CI 1.07-1.21; RRobese: 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.19; p-trendfor continuous BMI = 0.017) as compared to normal weight men. Obesity at ages 20 and 50 was similarly associated with both nocturia and prostate volume ≥ 30 cc. Considering trajectories of body size, men who were normal weight at age 20 and became overweight or obese by later-life had increased risks of nocturia (RRnormal to overweight: 1.09, 95% CI 0.98-1.22; RRnormal to obese: 1.28, 95% CI 1.10-1.47) and a prostate volume ≥ 30 cc (RRnormal to overweight: 1.12, 95% CI 1.05-1.20). Too few men were obese early in life to examine the independent effect of early-life body size. Later-life body size modified the association between physical activity and nocturia.

Methods:   Analysis of hsa-mir-106b-5p expression of two tissue samples from BPH patients and two PCa patients used NanoString nCounter Expression Assay then validated by qRT-PCR using 10 patient urine samples for prostate cancer and BPH. Furthermore, analysis of the role of hsa-mir-106b-5p in prostate cancer was carried out bioinformatically.  Results:   The results of this study indicated that the expression of hsa-mir-106b-5p in prostate cancer tissue was 1.23 times higher than that of BPH and urine of Indonesian patients (1.72 times). Moreover, this miRNA was upregulated in prostate cancer cells compared to normal cells 1.37 times. The hsa-mir-106b-5p appeared to be involved in the development of prostate cancer through the binding of genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways and tumor suppressor genes.

These updates our understanding of the role of hsa-mir-106b-5p in cancer and its potential as a candidate of a biomarker for clinical diagnosis of prostate cancer.""","""['Christin H Bonnu', 'Anggia N Ramadhani', 'Ranu B Saputro', 'Salsabila L Sesotyosari', 'R Danarto', 'Indwiani Astuti', 'Sofia M Haryana']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['miRNA-21 as High Potential Prostate Cancer Biomarker in Prostate Cancer Patients in Indonesia.', 'miR-21-5p, miR-141-3p, and miR-205-5p levels in urine-promising biomarkers for the identification of prostate and bladder cancer.', 'MiR-106b-5p: A Master Regulator of Potential Biomarkers for Breast Cancer Aggressiveness and Prognosis.', 'MiRNA-106b-5p in human cancers: diverse functions and promising biomarker.', 'The potential of microRNAs as human prostate cancer biomarkers: A meta-analysis of related studies.', 'Hsa-let-7c-5p, hsa-miR-130b-3p, and hsa-miR-142-3p as Novel miRNA Biomarkers for Melanoma Progression.', 'Urinary microRNAs and Their Significance in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: A 5-Year Update.', 'Evaluation of Diagnostic and Prognostic Value of hsa_circ_0084927 and Analysis of Associated ceRNA Network in Colorectal Cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   A total of 310 consecutive patients underwent multiparametric MRI according to a standardized institutional protocol before radical prostatectomy was performed by using the same 1.5-T MRI unit at a single institution between 2010 and 2012. Two radiologists blinded to clinical information assessed EPE according to standardized criteria. On the basis of the readings performed until 2017, the diagnostic performance of EPE Likert and Mehralivand EPE score were compared using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and decision curve methodology against histologic EPE as standard of reference. Prediction of biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS) was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and log rank test.  Results:   Of the 310 patients, 80 patients (26%) had EPE, including 33 with radial distance 1.1 mm or greater. Interrater reliability was fair (weighted κ 0.47 and 0.45) for both EPE grade and EPE Likert. Sensitivity for identifying EPE using EPE grade versus EPE Likert was 0.83 versus 0.86 and 0.86 versus 0.91 for radiologist 1 and 2, respectively. Specificity was 0.48 versus 0.58 and 0.39 versus 0.70 (P < .05 for radiologist 2). There were no significant differences in the ROC area under the curve or on decision curve analysis. Both EPE grade and EPE Likert were significant predictors of BRFS.  Conclusion:   Mehralivand EPE grade and EPE Likert have equivalent diagnostic performance for predicting EPE and BRFS with a similar degree of observer dependence.© RSNA, 2020Keywords: MR-Imaging, Neoplasms-Primary, Observer Performance, Outcomes Analysis, Prostate, StagingSupplemental material is available for this article.See also the commentary by Choyke in this issue.""","""['Lars A R Reisæter', 'Ole J Halvorsen', 'Christian Beisland', 'Alfred Honoré', 'Karsten Gravdal', 'Are Losnegård', 'Jan Monssen', 'Lars A Akslen', 'Martin Biermann']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Radiol Imaging Cancer""","""['A Grading System for Extraprostatic Extension of Prostate Cancer That We Can All Agree Upon?', 'Extraprostatic Tumor Extension: Comparison of Preoperative Multiparametric MRI Criteria and Histopathologic Correlation after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Which one is better for predicting extraprostatic extension on multiparametric MRI: ESUR score, Likert scale, tumor contact length, or EPE grade?', 'A Grading System for the Assessment of Risk of Extraprostatic Extension of Prostate Cancer at Multiparametric MRI.', 'Extraprostatic extension in prostate cancer: primer for radiologists.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Impact of prebiopsy MRI on prostate cancer staging: Results from the Norwegian Prostate Cancer Registry.', 'MRI Extraprostatic Extension Grade: Accuracy and Clinical Incremental Value in the Assessment of Extraprostatic Cancer.', 'Negative mpMRI Rules Out Extra-Prostatic Extension in Prostate Cancer before Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Current Opinion on the Use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Staging Prostate Cancer: A Narrative Review.', 'Diagnostic Performance of Extraprostatic Extension Grading System for Detection of Extraprostatic Extension in Prostate Cancer: A Diagnostic Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

Materials and methods:   A retrospective analysis of patients who underwent in-bore MRI-guided biopsy with additional random biopsies in areas with no visible MR targets (Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System, version 2 category 1 or 2) was conducted in this study. Diagnostic scans and in-bore MRI-guided biopsy were performed with a 3-T MRI scanner. Areas with no visible MR targets were biopsied in a random fashion whenever a zone or side did not have a visible focal target. Clinically significant cancers (CSCs) were defined as a Gleason score of 7 or greater. NPVs were stratified based on patient's prior biopsy status. Descriptive analysis was performed.  Results:   A total of 59 consecutive patients were included, with a median age of 65 years (interquartile range [IQR], 59-71 years). The median prostate-specific antigen level was 7 ng/mL (IQR, 4.9-10.8 ng/mL). Of the 59 patients, 16 (27.1%) were biopsy naive, 24 (40.7%) had prior negative transrectal US-guided biopsy findings, and 19 (32.2%) had prior positive transrectal US-guided biopsy findings. Forty-two (71.2%) biopsies revealed prostate cancer. A total of 112 areas with no visible MR targets were biopsied, of which 20 (17.9%) were cancers and 11 (9.8%) were CSCs. The NPV of areas with no visible MR targets was approximately 78% for all cancers and was 88.1% for CSCs. NPVs in biopsy-naive patients, patients with prior negative transrectal US-guided biopsy findings, and patients with prior positive transrectal US-guided biopsy findings were 62.5%, 83.3%, and 84.2%, respectively, for all cancers and 75.0%, 91.7%, and 94.7%, respectively, for CSCs.  Conclusion:   Areas with no visible MR targets in patients with MR-suspicious foci may still harbor CSCs that may significantly affect management plans. Additional biopsies from areas with no visible MR targets are warranted in this population.Keywords: Biopsy/Needle Aspiration, Interventional-Body, MR-Imaging, Prostate, Urinary© RSNA, 2019.""","""['Kareem K Elfatairy', 'Christopher P Filson', 'Martin G Sanda', 'Adeboye O Osunkoya', 'Sherif G Nour']""","""[]""","""2019""","""None""","""Radiol Imaging Cancer""","""['3-T Multiparametric MRI Followed by In-Bore MR-Guided Biopsy for Detecting Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer After Prior Negative Transrectal Ultrasound-Guided Biopsy.', 'Prospective randomized trial comparing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided in-bore biopsy to MRI-ultrasound fusion and transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy in patients with prior negative biopsies.', 'Prospective study of diagnostic accuracy comparing prostate cancer detection by transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy versus magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with subsequent MR-guided biopsy in men without previous prostate biopsies.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound image fusion guidance of prostate biopsies: current status, challenges and future perspectives.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.']"""
