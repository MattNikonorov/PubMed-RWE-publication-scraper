Significant interactions between the presence of cancer and S/R are observed in the use of coping strategies such as religion, humor and disconnection. Spirituality as a predictor variable through the use of religion as a strategy, increased the explanatory capacity of age by 58.9% (β = .794) while praying/talking to God predicts the use of this strategy with a β = .383. In people with cancer, active coping was predicted by spirituality (β = .327). However, spirituality was a negative predictor of maladaptive coping, with a beta coefficient equal to .383.

This study was designed to investigate the prognostic role of preoperative 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in predicting pathological upgrading from multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsy (mpMRI-TB) to final radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens in patients with localized PCa.  Methods:   A total of 67 biopsy-confirmed localized PCa patients with mpMRI and 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT prior to RP were included. Clinical and imaging characteristics derived from mpMRI and PET/CT were compared in patients with or without pathological upgrading. Predictors for pathological upgrading were evaluated by using univariate and multivariable analyses. A prediction model was developed based on the identified parameters and validated using internal validation.  Results:   Pathological upgrading from mpMRI-TB to final RP specimens occurred in 38.8% (26/67) of the patients. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed SUVmax (OR: 1.223, 95% CI 1.068-1.399, p = 0.003); highest tumor grade at mpMRI-TB, ISUP grade group (ISUP GG) 1 vs. 4 (OR: 0.11, 95% CI 0.000-0.452, p = 0.018) and ISUP GG 2 vs. 4 (OR: 0.16, 95% CI 0.001-0.252, p = 0.003); and multifocality on PET/CT (OR: 9.821, 95% CI 1.438-67.085, p = 0.02) were independent risk factors for pathological upgrading. Our developed prediction model based on the identified parameter showed good calibration at internal validation (mean absolute error = 0.033).

Patient-reported anxiety, depression and sleep quality might have changed due to these special circumstances. Therefore, we analyzed the symptom burden of patients treated with palliative radiotherapy at our center.  Patients and methods:   A retrospective study was performed of 50 consecutive patients and the results were compared to those obtained in a previous pre-COVID study. The Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale was employed to assess the preradiotherapy symptoms.  Results:   The highest mean scores were reported for pain in activity (3.2) and dry mouth (3.1). Regarding anxiety, sadness/depression and sleep, the corresponding scores were 1.5, 1.2 and 2.7, respectively. Compared to the previous study, no significant increases were found. Most items had numerically lower mean values, e.g. anxiety (1.5 vs. 2.7). Both study populations had comparable median age (70.5 vs. 70 years), gender distribution and proportion of patients with bone metastases. However, there were two significant imbalances, namely a lower proportion of patients with prostate cancer (12 vs. 30%, p=0.02) and breast cancer (0 vs. 12%, p=0.02).  Conclusion:   In patients who showed up for radiation treatment planning, the suspected increase in anxiety, sadness/depression and sleep disturbance was not demonstrable. It is not known whether or not patients with substantial worries chose to decline referral to palliative radiotherapy.

Here we present an autonomous un-supervised treatment planning approach, integrated as basis for online adaptive magnetic resonance guided RT (MRgRT), which was delivered to a prostate cancer patient as a first-in-human experience.  Materials and methods:   For an intermediate risk prostate cancer patient OARs and targets were automatically segmented using a deep learning-based software and logical volume operators. A baseline plan for the 1.5 T MR-Linac (20x3 Gy) was automatically generated using particle swarm optimization (PSO) without any human interaction. Plan quality was evaluated by predefined dosimetric criteria including appropriate tolerances. Online plan adaptation during clinical MRgRT was defined as first checkpoint for human interaction.  Results:   OARs and targets were successfully segmented (3 min) and used for automatic plan optimization (300 min). The autonomous generated plan satisfied 12/16 dosimetric criteria, however all remained within tolerance. Without prior human validation, this baseline plan was successfully used during online MRgRT plan adaptation, where 14/16 criteria were fulfilled. As postulated, human interaction was necessary only during plan adaptation.  Conclusion:   Autonomous, un-supervised data preparation and treatment planning was first-in-human shown to be feasible for adaptive MRgRT and successfully applied. The checkpoint for first human intervention was at the time of online MRgRT plan adaptation. Autonomous planning reduced the time delay between simulation and start of RT and may thus allow for real-time MRgRT applications in the future.""","""['Luise A Künzel', 'Marcel Nachbar', 'Markus Hagmüller', 'Cihan Gani', 'Simon Boeke', 'Daniel Zips', 'Daniela Thorwarth']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Patient-specific transfer learning for auto-segmentation in adaptive 0.35 T MRgRT of prostate cancer: a bi-centric evaluation.', 'Retrospective study comparing MR-guided radiation therapy (MRgRT) setup strategies for prostate treatment: repositioning vs. replanning.', 'First 500 Fractions Delivered with a Magnetic Resonance-guided Radiotherapy System: Initial Experience.', 'Medical physics challenges in clinical MR-guided radiotherapy.', 'Artificial Intelligence in magnetic Resonance guided Radiotherapy: Medical and physical considerations on state of art and future perspectives.', 'Beyond diagnosis: is there a role for radiomics in prostate cancer management?', 'Adaptive radiotherapy for breast cancer.', 'Evaluation of therapeutic radiographer contouring for magnetic resonance image guided online adaptive prostate radiotherapy.', 'Towards real-time radiotherapy planning: The role of autonomous treatment strategies.', 'Technical feasibility of online adaptive stereotactic treatments in the abdomen on a robotic radiosurgery system.']"""

We utilized two prostate cancer cell lines (PC3 and DU145) along with patient tissue and knockdowns to evaluate overall HPRT expression. The surface localization of HPRT was determined utilizing flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy followed by ADCC to evaluate targeting potential. We found significant upregulation of HPRT within malignant samples with approximately 47% of patients had elevated levels of HPRT compared to normal controls. We also observed a significant association between HPRT and the plasma membrane of DU145 cells (p = 0.0004), but found no presence on PC3 cells (p = 0.14). This was confirmed with scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy. ADCC experiments were performed to determine whether HPRT could be used as a target antigen for selective cell-mediated killing. We found that DU145 cells treated with HPRT antibodies had a significantly higher incidence of cell death than both isotype treated samples and PC3 cells treated with the same concentrations of HPRT antibody. Finally, we determined that p53 had a significant impact on HPRT expression both internally and on the surface of cancer cells.

We previously developed a clinical-grade urine test (Michigan Prostate Score [MiPS]) for individualized aggressive PCa risk prediction. MiPS combines serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the TMPRSS2:ERG (T2:ERG) gene fusion, and PCA3 lncRNA in whole urine after digital rectal examination (DRE).  Objective:   To improve on MiPS with a novel next-generation sequencing (NGS) multibiomarker urine assay for early detection of aggressive PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   Preclinical development and validation of a post-DRE urine RNA NGS assay (Urine Prostate Seq [UPSeq]) assessing 84 PCa transcriptomic biomarkers, including T2:ERG, PCA3, additional PCa fusions/isoforms, mRNAs, lncRNAs, and expressed mutations. Our UPSeq model was trained on 73 patients and validated on a held-out set of 36 patients representing the spectrum of disease (benign to grade group [GG] 5 PCa).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of UPSeq was compared with PSA, MiPS, and other existing models/biomarkers for predicting GG ≥3 PCa.  Results and limitations:   UPSeq demonstrated high analytical accuracy and concordance with MiPS, and was able to detect expressed germline HOXB13 and somatic SPOP mutations. In an extreme design cohort (n = 109; benign/GG 1 vs GG ≥3 PCa, stratified to exclude GG 2 cancer in order to capture signal difference between extreme ends of disease), UPSeq showed differential expression for T2:ERG.T1E4 (1.2 vs 78.8 median normalized reads, p < 0.00001) and PCA3 (1024 vs 2521, p = 0.02), additional T2:ERG splice isoforms, and other candidate biomarkers. Using machine learning, we developed a 15-transcript model on the training set (n = 73) that outperformed serum PSA and sequencing-derived MiPS in predicting GG ≥3 PCa in the held-out validation set (n = 36; AUC 0.82 vs 0.69 and 0.69, respectively).  Conclusions:   These results support the potential utility of our novel urine-based RNA NGS assay to supplement PSA for improved early detection of aggressive PCa.

Tumor microenvironment-responsive nanosized drug delivery systems have shown enormous potential to improve the anticancer efficacy and minimize the systemic side effects of chemotherapeutics. However, most of the currently redox-responsive nanoparticles respond only to single stimuli, which compromise the treatment effect. Hence, inspired by the abundance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and intracellular glutathione (GSH) in cancer cells, we proposed a unique ROS and GSH dual responsive nanocarrier (PCL-SS) for DTX delivery. The DTX-loaded PCL-SS nanoparticles (PCL-SS@DTX NPs) were not only stable in a normal physiological environment but also rapidly triggered DTX release in prostate cancer cells. In vitro experiments showed that PCL-SS@DTX NPs had robust prostate cancer cell cytotoxicity, induced cell apoptosis, inhibited cell migration and invasion and exhibited satisfactory biocompatibility.

The aim of this study was to prospectively analyze the changes in urinary function in patients operated on for rectal cancer, and to identify risk factors that may have an impact on the deterioration of postoperative urinary function.  Methods:   A prospective study of urinary function in rectal cancer patients who had elective oncological resection with curative intention at the Arnau de Vilanova Hospital in Valencia, Spain, from January 2017 to March 2019. The evaluation of urinary function was performed using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) preoperatively, at 6 and 12 months after surgery. Predictive factors of urinary dysfunction were identified by univariate and multivariate analysis.  Results:   Ninety-four patients were enrolled in the study. Eighty-seven of them completed all the follow-up assessments (48 men and 39 women, mean age 65.74 ± 10.95 years,). The mean IPSS was 7.96 ± 7.59 preoperatively, 9.01 ± 6.81 at 6 months, and 8.63 ± 5.59 at 12 months, without statistically significant differences. There were no differences in IPSS between males and females. Preoperative urinary dysfunction was 39% and at 12 months, a deterioration occurred in 23 patients (26.4%). IPSS analysis of symptoms showed a statistically significant worsening of nocturia at 6 months (p = 0.002) and 1 year after surgery (p = 0.037) in women.

Tau oligomers are considered pathologic forms of the protein able to initiate specific protein accumulation diseases, called tauopathies. In our study, we investigated the potential association between autophagy and tau oligomers accumulation and its role in the response of prostate cancer cells to docetaxel.  Methods:   We evaluated in vitro the expression of tau oligomers in prostate cancer cell lines, PC3 and DU145, in presence of autophagy inhibitors and investigated the role of tau oligomers accumulation in resistance to docetaxel treatment.  Results:   Tau protein was basally expressed in prostate cancer lines as several monomeric and oligomeric forms. The pharmacologic inhibition of autophagy induced in cancer cells the accumulation of tau protein, with a prevalent expression of oligomeric forms. Immunofluorescence analysis of untreated cells revealed that tau was visible mainly in dividing cells where it was localized on the mitotic spindle. Inhibition of autophagy determined an evident upregulation of tau signal in dividing cells and the presence of aberrant monoastral mitotic spindles. The accumulation of tau oligomers was associated with DNA DSB and increased cytotoxic effect by docetaxel.  Conclusions:   Our data indicate that autophagy could exert a promoting role in cancer growth and during chemotherapy facilitating degradation of tau protein and thus blocking the antimitotic effect of accumulated tau oligomers. Thus, therapeutic strategies aimed at stimulating tau oligomers formation, such as autophagy inhibition, could be an effective adjuvant in cancer therapy.""","""['Stefano Martellucci', 'Letizia Clementi', 'Samantha Sabetta', 'Paola Muzi', 'Vincenzo Mattei', 'Mauro Bologna', 'Adriano Angelucci']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['Dual role of autophagy on docetaxel-sensitivity in prostate cancer cells.', 'Effect of docetaxel on the regulation of proliferation and apoptosis of human prostate cancer cells.', 'Synergistic antitumor interaction of valproic acid and simvastatin sensitizes prostate cancer to docetaxel by targeting CSCs compartment via YAP inhibition.', 'Suppressed PLIN3 frequently occurs in prostate cancer, promoting docetaxel resistance via intensified autophagy, an event reversed by chloroquine.', 'Targeting autophagy in prostate cancer: preclinical and clinical evidence for therapeutic response.', 'Mitotic phosphorylation of Tau/MAPT modulates cell cycle progression in prostate cancer cells.', 'Tau Isoforms: Gaining Insight into MAPT Alternative Splicing.', 'Tau Protein as Therapeutic Target for Cancer?

Results demonstrated that in addition to the heparan sulfate proteoglycan, perlecan, all components of the PSPN Complex were degraded by MMP-7. To investigate the functional consequences of PSPN Complex cleavage, we developed a preformed microtumor model to examine initiation of cell dispersion after MMP-7 digestion.

However, the biological characteristics of human LNCaP cells before/after implanting in athymic mouse and its relevance to clinical human prostate outcomes remain unclear and may dictate interpretation of biological efficacies/mechanisms of diet/diet-derived experimental treatments. In this study, transcriptome profiles and pathways of human prostate LNCaP cells before (in vitro) and after (in vivo) implanting into xenograft mouse were compared using RNA-sequencing technology (RNA-seq) followed by bioinformatic analysis. A shift from androgen-responsive to androgen nonresponsive status was observed when comparing LNCaP xenograft tumor to culture cells. Androgen receptor and aryl-hydrocarbon pathway were found to be inhibited and interleukin-1 (IL-1) mediated pathways contributed to these changes. Coupled with in vitro experiments modeling for androgen exposure, cell-matrix interaction, inflammation, and hypoxia, we identified specific mechanisms that may contribute to the observed changes in genes and pathways.

In vivo, Par-4 is cleaved by caspase-3 at Asp-131 to generate the 25 kDa functionally active cleaved Par-4 protein (cl-Par-4) that inhibits NF-κB-mediated cell survival pathways and causes selective apoptosis in tumor cells. Here, we have employed circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering (DLS) to assess the effects of various monovalent and divalent salts upon the conformation of cl-Par-4 in vitro. We have previously shown that high levels of sodium can induce the cl-Par-4 fragment to form highly compact, highly helical tetramers in vitro. Spectral characteristics suggest that most or at least much of the helical content in these tetramers are non-coiled coils. Here, we have shown that potassium produces a similar effect as was previously reported for sodium and that magnesium salts also produce a similar conformation effect, but at an approximately five times lower ionic concentration. We have also shown that anion identity has far less influence than does cation identity. The degree of helicity induced by each of these salts suggests that the ""Selective for Apoptosis in Cancer cells"" (SAC) domain-the region of Par-4 that is most indispensable for its apoptotic function-is likely to be helical in cl-Par-4 under the studied high salt conditions.

One-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) analyzes the entire LN by detecting cytokeratin 19 (CK19) mRNA as a surrogate for LN metastases requiring less effort than conventional biomolecular techniques. We aimed to evaluate performance of OSNA in detecting sentinel LN (SLN) metastases in PCa. Methods: SLNs (n = 534) of 64 intermediate- or high-risk PCa patients undergoing radical prostatectomy with extended and sentinel-guided lymphadenectomy were cut into slices and alternatingly assigned to OSNA and histopathology (hematoxylin-eosin staining, CK19, and CK AE1/AE3 immunohistochemistry). Sensitivity and specificity of OSNA and concordance and measure of agreement (Cohen's kappa (κ)) between OSNA and histopathology were assessed. Results: Histopathology revealed metastases in 76 SLNs. Sensitivity and specificity of OSNA were 84.2% and 96.1%, respectively. Discordant results were recorded for 30 of 534 SLNs, revealing high concordance (94.4%). Twenty-four discordant cases were classified as micrometastases, indicating a possible allocation bias. In 18 cases, positive results were conferred only by OSNA resulting in seven LN-positive patients who were missed by histopathology. Overall, the level of agreement was high (κ = 0.78).

We aimed to explore the causal relationships of the serum urea level with cancer development by focusing on renal cell carcinoma (RCC) using the Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. Summary estimates were collected from the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method based on six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The selected SNPs related to the serum urea were obtained from a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 13,312 European participants. The summary statistics of RCC were also available from public databases (IARC, n = 5219 cases, n = 8011 controls). Sensitivity analyses included the weighted median and MR-Egger methods. Serum urea was inversely associated with RCC in females (effect = 1.93; 95% CI: 1.24 to 3.01; p = 0.004) but exhibited null association with RCC in males, breast cancer (BRCA) in both genders and prostate cancer (PCa) in males. Similar conclusions were also drawn from the weighted median and MR-Egger. These findings reveal an intriguing link between serum urea and cancer risks for the very first time.

HERV expression was also analysed in matched malignant and benign prostate tissue samples from men with prostate cancer (n = 27, median age 65.2 years (range 47-70)) and compared to prostate cancer-free male controls (n = 11). Prostate cancer epithelial cell lines exhibited a signature of HERV RNA overexpression, with all HERVs analysed, except HERV-E Pol, showing heightened expression in at least two, but more commonly all, cell lines analysed. Analysis of primary prostate material indicated increased expression of HERV-E Pol but decreased expression of HERV-E Env in both malignant and benign regions of the prostate in men with prostate cancer as compared to those without. Expression of HERV-K Gag was significantly higher in malignant regions of the prostate in men with prostate cancer as compared to matched benign regions and prostate cancer-free men (p < 0.001 for both), with 85.2% of prostate cancers donors showing malignancy-associated upregulation of HERV-K Gag RNA. HERV-K Gag protein was detected in 12/18 (66.7%) malignant tissues using immunohistochemistry, but only 1/18 (5.6%) benign tissue sections. Heightened expression of HERV-K Gag RNA and protein appears to be a sensitive and specific biomarker of prostate malignancy in this cohort of men with prostate carcinoma, supporting its potential utility as a non-invasive, adjunct clinical biomarker.""","""['Simin D Rezaei', 'Joshua A Hayward', 'Sam Norden', 'John Pedersen', 'John Mills', 'Anna C Hearps', 'Gilda Tachedjian']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Viruses""","""['Expression of the human endogenous retrovirus HERV-W family in various human tissues and cancer cells.', 'Prostate cancer progression correlates with increased humoral immune response to a human endogenous retrovirus GAG protein.', 'Phylogeny of a novel family of human endogenous retrovirus sequences, HERV-W, in humans and other primates.', 'Expression and regulation of human endogenous retrovirus W elements.', 'Molecular biology of type A endogenous retrovirus.', 'Molecular mechanisms of syncytin-1 in tumors and placental development related diseases.', 'Anti-HERV-K Drugs and Vaccines, Possible Therapies against Tumors.', 'An assessment of bioinformatics tools for the detection of human endogenous retroviral insertions in short-read genome sequencing data.', 'Endogenous Retrovirus RNA Expression Differences between Race, Stage and HPV Status Offer Improved Prognostication among Women with Cervical Cancer.', 'Human Endogenous Retroviruses: Friends and Foes in Urology Clinics.']"""

Thus far, the interactions between MCs and CAFs remain poorly understood. To identify molecular changes that may alter resident MC function in the prostate tumor microenvironment, we profiled the transcriptome of human prostate MCs isolated from patient-matched non-tumor and tumor-associated regions of fresh radical prostatectomy tissue. Transcriptomic profiling revealed a distinct gene expression profile of MCs isolated from prostate tumor regions, including the downregulation of SAMD14, a putative tumor suppressor gene. Proteomic profiling revealed that overexpression of SAMD14 in HMC-1 altered the secretion of proteins associated with immune regulation and extracellular matrix processes. To assess MC biological function within a model of the prostate tumor microenvironment, HMC-1-SAMD14+ conditioned media was added to co-cultures of primary prostatic CAFs and prostate epithelium. HMC-1-SAMD14+ secretions were shown to reduce the deposition and alignment of matrix produced by CAFs and suppress pro-tumorigenic prostate epithelial morphology.

Skp2 is a substrate-recruiting component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, whose activity is regulated through neddylation. Slug is a transcriptional repressor involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, which may contribute to therapy resistance. Although Skp2 has previously been associated with a mesenchymal phenotype and prostate cancer progression, the relationship with Slug deserves further elucidation. We have previously shown that a high Gleason score (≥8) is associated with higher Skp2 and lower E-cadherin expression. In this study, significantly increased expression of Skp2, AR, and Slug, along with E-cadherin downregulation, was observed in primary prostate cancer in patients who already had lymph node metastases. Skp2 was slightly correlated with Slug and AR in the whole cohort (Rs 0.32 and 0.37, respectively), which was enhanced for both proteins in patients with high Gleason scores (Rs 0.56 and 0.53, respectively) and, in the case of Slug, also in patients with metastasis to lymph nodes (Rs 0.56). Coexpression of Skp2 and Slug was confirmed in prostate cancer tissues by multiplex immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. The same relationship between these two proteins was observed in three sets of prostate epithelial cell lines (PC3, DU145, and E2) and their mesenchymal counterparts. Chemical inhibition of Skp2, but not RNA interference, modestly decreased Slug protein in PC3 and its docetaxel-resistant subline PC3 DR12. Importantly, chemical inhibition of Skp2 by MLN4924 upregulated p27 and decreased Slug expression in PC3, PC3 DR12, and LAPC4 cells.

PCa has a high genetic heterogeneity, and cannot be separated into well-defined molecular subtypes. Despite this, there is consensus about the role of the androgen receptor (AR) in all stages of the disease, including the transition to the castration-resistant phenotype. Since AR is a transcription factor, we investigated the possibility of PCa presenting a pattern of global gene expression during disease progression. By analyzing the TCGA and CCLE datasets, we were able to find a pattern of waves of genes being expressed during each stage of disease progression. This phenomenon suggests the existence of a mechanism that globally regulates gene expression, being AR, telomeres, and zinc finger proteins (ZNF), three important players. The AR modulates the telomere biology, and its transcription is regulated by ZNF. Recently, a study suggested that the telomere length might influence the expression of ZNF. Thus, we hypothesized that changes in the triad AR, telomeres, and ZNF control gene expression during the progression of PCa.""","""['Gabriel Arantes Dos Santos', 'Nayara Izabel Viana', 'Ruan Pimenta', 'Sabrina T Reis', 'Katia Ramos Moreira Leite', 'Miguel Srougi']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Hypotheses""","""['Elevation of androgen receptor promotes prostate cancer metastasis by induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and reduction of KAT5.', 'The mechanisms of prostate cancer progression through androgen receptor.', 'Determinants of Gli2 co-activation of wildtype and naturally truncated androgen receptors.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Identification of\xa0ISG15 and ZFP36 as novel hypoxia- and immune-related gene signatures contributing to a new perspective for the treatment of prostate cancer by bioinformatics and experimental verification.']"""

We have summarized the results of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays to identify i(12p), performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-validated setting for 536 specimens. In addition, the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Project GENIE registry and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data sets were evaluated for chromosome 12p gains, and a limited number of cases were concurrently evaluated using FISH, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays and next-generation sequencing (NGS; including mate-pair sequencing). Specimens submitted for FISH testing were frequently from potential sites of metastases (male: 70.9% and female: 69.3%), and polysomy of chromosome 12 with or without concurrent i(12p) was a frequent finding, seen in 3% (16/536) and 35% (186/536) of cases, respectively. Our analysis suggests that 12p gains are likely to be present in approximately 73% of male GCT and in 32% of female GCT (AACR GENIE, n = 555). When comparing TCGA cases of testicular GCT (n = 149) to combined cases of sarcoma, colorectal, prostate, and urothelial carcinoma (n = 1754), 12p gains had a sensitivity of 77.2% and specificity of 97.3% for GCT. Some advantages of FISH over SNP arrays/NGS include relatively lower cost, rapid turnaround time, the ability to analyze biopsy material with a limited number of tumor cells (50 cells), and the ability to distinguish i(12p) from polysomy. The ability to spatially restrict the analysis to cells of interest is critical, as specimens submitted for testing often have low tumor purity. Disadvantages include false negative results due to an inability to detect segmental gains due to FISH probe design. With the availability of numerous testing modalities, including FISH, SNP arrays, and NGS-based assays, a nuanced understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of each methodology, as has been presented in this study, may inform appropriate testing strategies.""","""['C Eric Freitag', 'William R Sukov', 'Alan H Bryce', 'Jamie V Berg', 'Chad M Vanderbilt', 'Wei Shen', 'James B Smadbeck', 'Patricia T Greipp', 'Rhett P Ketterling', 'Robert B Jenkins', 'Loren Herrera-Hernandez', 'Brian A Costello', 'R Houston Thompson', 'Stephen A Boorjian', 'Bradley C Leibovich', 'Rafael E Jimenez', 'Stephen J Murphy', 'George Vasmatzis', 'John C Cheville', 'Sounak Gupta']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Hum Pathol""","""['Isochromosome 12p and polysomy 12 in primary central nervous system germ cell tumors: frequency and association with clinicopathologic features.', 'Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) Detection of Chromosomal 12p Anomalies in Testicular Germ Cell Tumors.', 'Acquired isochromosome 12p, somatic TP53 and PTEN mutations, and a germline ATM variant in an adolescent male with concurrent acute megakaryoblastic leukemia and mediastinal germ cell tumor.', 'Reviews of chromosome studies in urological tumors.

Methods:   Men diagnosed with PCa from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2015 were identified from the Massachusetts and Pennsylvania cancer registries. All-cause mortality and PCa and cardiovascular cause-specific mortality were assessed. To estimate neighborhood socioeconomic position (nSEP), a summary score was generated using census tract-level measures of income, wealth, educational attainment, and racial and income segregation. Participants were grouped by diagnosis year (2000-2003, 2004-2007, 2008-2011, or 2012-2015), and changing trends in the mortality rate ratio by race and nSEP were estimated using covariate-adjusted Cox models with follow-up for up to 10 years, until death, or until censoring on January 1, 2018.  Results:   There were 193,883 patients with PCa and 43,661 deaths over 1,404,131 person-years of follow-up. The Black-White adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) from 2000 to 2003 through 2012 to 2015 was stable for all-cause mortality (aHR, 1.14 to 0.97; P for heterogeneity = .42), decreased for PCa-specific mortality (aHR, 1.38 to 0.93; P for heterogeneity = .005), and increased for cardiovascular mortality (aHR, 1.09 to 1.28; P for heterogeneity = .034).

Conclusions:   Although Black-White disparities in prostate mortality declined in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania over the study period, nSEP mortality disparity trends were stagnant or increased, warranting further attention.  Lay summary:   Few reports have examined whether racial and socioeconomic disparities in prostate cancer mortality have widened or narrowed in recent years. Using data from 2 state registries (Massachusetts and Pennsylvania) with differing intensities of government-mandated health insurance, trends in racial and neighborhood socioeconomic disparities were studied among Black and White men diagnosed from 2000 to 2015. Overall, trends in racial disparities were stagnant for all-cause mortality, shrank for prostate mortality, and widened for cardiovascular mortality.

Mechanistically, EZH2 strengthens the FBL-NOP56 interaction and facilitates the assembly of box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein. Strikingly, EZH2 deficiency impairs the translation process globally and reduces internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent translation initiation in cancer cells.

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a prime suspect for acquired therapy resistance, as prostate cancer (PCa) cells are able to increase GR signaling during anti-androgen therapy and thereby circumvent androgen receptor (AR)-blockade and cell death. As standard AR-directed therapies fail to block the GR and GR inhibitors might result in intolerable side effects, the identification of GR signature genes, which are better suited for a targeted approach, is of clinical importance. Therefore, the specific epithelial and stromal GR signature was determined in cancer-associated fibroblasts as well as in abiraterone and enzalutamide-resistant cells after glucocorticoid (GC) treatment. Microarray and ChIP analysis identified MAO-A as a directly up-regulated mutual epithelial and stromal GR target, which is induced after GC treatment and during PCa progression. Elevated MAO-A levels were confirmed in in vitro cell models, in primary tissue cultures after GC treatment, and in patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with GCs. MAO-A expression correlates with GR/AR activity as well as with a reduced progression-free survival. Pharmacological MAO-A inhibition combined with 2nd generation AR signaling inhibitors or chemotherapeutics results in impaired growth of androgen-dependent, androgen-independent, and long-term anti-androgen-treated cells. In summary, these findings demonstrate that targeting MAO-A represents an innovative therapeutic strategy to synergistically block GR and AR dependent PCa cell growth and thereby overcome therapy resistance.""","""['Martin Puhr', 'Andrea Eigentler', 'Florian Handle', 'Hubert Hackl', 'Christian Ploner', 'Isabel Heidegger', 'Georg Schaefer', 'Maximilian P Brandt', 'Julia Hoefer', 'Gabri Van der Pluijm', 'Helmut Klocker']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['The expression of glucocorticoid receptor is negatively regulated by active androgen receptor signaling in prostate tumors.', 'Glucocorticoid receptor activity contributes to resistance to androgen-targeted therapy in prostate cancer.', 'Differential targeting of androgen and glucocorticoid receptors induces ER stress and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells: a novel therapeutic modality.', 'Interference with the androgen receptor protein stability in therapy-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor functions in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance to new agents targeting the androgen axis.', 'Glucocorticoid Receptor and β-Catenin Interact in Prostate Cancer Cells and Their Co-Inhibition Attenuates Tumorsphere Formation, Stemness, and Docetaxel Resistance.', 'Monoamine oxidase A: An emerging therapeutic target in prostate cancer.', 'Mechanisms of Susceptibility and Resilience to PTSD: Role of Dopamine Metabolism and BDNF Expression in the Hippocampus.', 'Circadian Rhythm Disruption as a Contributor to Racial Disparities in Prostate Cancer.', 'Integrative Analysis of Bulk RNA-Seq and Single-Cell RNA-Seq Unveils the Characteristics of the Immune Microenvironment and Prognosis Signature in Prostate Cancer.']"""

MiRNAs have been linked to factors associated with aggressive prostate cancer such as biochemical recurrence (BCR) and metastasis. In this study, we aimed to identify urinary exosomal miRNAs as prognostic markers associated with BCR in intermediate-risk prostate cancer. We profiled the expression levels of miRNAs via next generation sequencing in urinary exosomes from 21 non-BCR patients and 6 BCR patients of intermediate-risk prostate cancer. A total of 21 urinary exosomal miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed (> twofold) in BCR patients compared to non-BCR patients. For external validation, we validated these results using quantitative reverse transcription PCR in an independent cohort of 28 non-BCR patients and 26 BCR patients. A validation analysis revealed that three miRNAs (miR-26a-5p, miR-532-5p, and miR-99b-3p) were upregulated in exosomes from BCR patients. The univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that miR-532-5p was an important predictive factor for BCR of intermediate-risk prostate cancer. In conclusion, miR-532-5p in urine exosomes might be a potential biomarker for predicting BCR, which is a poor prognosis in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer.

This may affect the outcomes of PSA-based screening. We investigated the effect of PSA-based screening at 4-year intervals on PCa incidence and mortality separately among users and non-users of antidiabetic medication with the hypothesis that screening would detect less low-grade cancer and more high-grade cancer in diabetic men. A cohort of 80,458 men from the Finnish Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (FinRSPC) were linked to national prescription database to obtain information on antidiabetic medication purchases. PCa risk and mortality were compared between the FinRSPC screening arm (SA) and the control arm (CA) separately among users and non-users of antidiabetic medication. Among antidiabetic medication users median PSA was lower than in non-users (0.93 and 1.09 ng/ml, respectively, P for difference = 0.001). Screening increased overall PCa incidence compared to CA after the first screen both among medication users and non-users (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.08-1.60 and HR 1.55, 95% CI 1.44-1.66, respectively). On the second and third screen the difference between SA and CA attenuated only among medication users. Detection of Gleason 6 tumors was lower among medication users, whereas no difference was observed in detection of Gleason 8-10 cancers. Concordantly, screening affected PCa mortality similarly regardless of antidiabetic medication use (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.14-1.07 and HR 0.19, 95% CI 0.11-0.33 among users and non-users after three screens, respectively. P for difference = 0.18). Median PSA is lower in men using antidiabetic drugs than among non-users. Systematic PSA screening detects less low-risk tumors among medication users, whereas detection of high-risk tumors and mortality effects are similar regardless of medication use. This suggests that antidiabetic medication users may form a suitable target group for PCa screening, with less screening-related overdiagnosis of indolent tumors.""","""['A Vettenranta', 'T J Murtola', 'K Talala', 'K Taari', 'U-H Stenman', 'T L J Tammela', 'A Auvinen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Antidiabetic drug use and prostate cancer risk in the Finnish Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer.', 'Outcomes of Prostate-specific Antigen-based Prostate Cancer Screening Among Men Using Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs.', 'Outcomes of Screening for Prostate Cancer Among Men Who Use Statins.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force.']"""

However, heterogeneous antigen expression and antigen loss remain important limitations of targeted immunotherapy in solid tumors. Therefore, targeting multiple tumor-associated antigens simultaneously is expected to improve the outcome of CAR-T cell therapies. Due to the instability of single-chain variable fragments, it remains challenging to develop the simultaneous targeting of multiple antigens using traditional single-chain fragment variable (scFv)-based CARs.  Methods:   We used Humabody VH domains derived from a transgenic mouse to obtain fully human prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) VH and mesothelin (MSLN) VH sequences and redirect T cell with VH based-CAR. The antitumor activity and mode of action of PSMA VH and MSLN VH were evaluated in vitro and in vivo compared with the traditional scFv-based CARs.  Results:   Human VH domain-based CAR targeting PSMA and MSLN are stable and functional both in vitro and in vivo. VH modules in the bispecific format are capable of binding their specific target with similar affinity as their monovalent counterparts. Bispecific CARs generated by joining two human antibody VH domains can prevent tumor escape in tumor with heterogeneous antigen expression.  Conclusions:   Fully human antibody VH domains can be used to generate functional CAR molecules, and redirected T cells elicit antitumoral responses in solid tumors at least as well as conventional scFv-based CARs. In addition, VH domains can be used to generate bispecific CAR-T cells to simultaneously target two different antigens expressed by tumor cells, and therefore, achieve better tumor control in solid tumors.""","""['Guanmeng Wang#', 'Xin Zhou#', 'Giovanni Fucà', 'Elena Dukhovlinova', 'Peishun Shou', 'Hongxia Li', 'Colette Johnston', 'Brian Mcguinness', 'Gianpietro Dotti', 'Hongwei Du']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Immunother Cancer""","""['Engineered Jurkat Cells for Targeting Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen on Prostate Cancer Cells by Nanobody-Based Chimeric Antigen Receptor.', 'Therapeutic effiacy of T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptor derived from a mesothelin-specific scFv in orthotopic human pancreatic cancer animal models.', 'Chimeric cytokine receptor enhancing PSMA-CAR-T cell-mediated prostate cancer regression.', 'The application of prostate specific membrane antigen in CART‑cell therapy for treatment of prostate carcinoma (Review).', 'Bispecific antibodies: An old story with a bright future… with CAR-T cells!.', 'Challenges of Anti-Mesothelin CAR-T-Cell Therapy.', ""Tumor buster - where will the CAR-T cell therapy 'missile' go?"", 'From Anti-HER-2 to Anti-HER-2-CAR-T Cells: An Evolutionary Immunotherapy Approach for Gastric Cancer.', 'Reprogramming the tumor microenvironment by genome editing for precision cancer therapy.', 'T cells expressing CD5/CD7 bispecific chimeric antigen receptors with fully human heavy-chain-only domains mitigate tumor antigen escape.']"""

Compared to open radical prostatectomy, the amount of data on potential risk factors for LC formation is still limited. The aim of the present study was to identify risk factors for symptomatic LC formation (sLC) after RARP with PLND.  Methods:   We used the data of a prospective multicentre series of 232 RARP patients which were treated between March 2017 and December 2017. The primary endpoint was the presence of sLC within 90 days. Asymptomatic LC (aLC) formation was also recorded. We evaluated clinical, perioperative, and histopathological criteria and compared their distribution in patients with and without post-operative sLC. Uni- and multivariable logistic regression analyses (MVAs) were performed to identify potential predictors for LC formation. Regarding the influence of patients' BMI, 2 models were calculated: BMI continuously (model 1) and BMI dichotomized with cut-off 30 kg/m2 (WHO definition, model 2).  Results:   Post-operative sLC was present in 21 patients (9.1%), while aLC was detected in 49 patients (21.1%) 90 days after RARP with PLND. Patients with sLC showed higher median baseline PSA levels (9.8 vs. 8.1 ng/mL), higher prevalence of obesity (BMI >30; 42.9 vs. 19.9%), and longer median console time (180 vs. 165 min) compared to patients without sLC.

This could improve risk stratification before commencing a new treatment. We hypothesized that a second sample collected after one cycle of treatment could refine outcome prediction of patients identified as poor prognosis based on plasma DNA collected pre-treatment.  Patients and methods:   Plasma DNA [128 pre-treatment, 134 cycle 2 day 1 (C2D1), and 49 progression] from 151 chemotherapy-naive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients in a phase II study of abiraterone acetate (NCT01867710) were subjected to custom targeted next-generation sequencing covering exons of these genes: TP53, AR, RB1, PTEN, PIK3CA, BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, CDK12, CHEK2, FANCA HDAC2 and PALB2. We also captured 1500 pan-genome regions enriched for single nucleotide polymorphisms to allow detection of tumor DNA using the rolling B-allele method. We tested associations with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).  Results:   Plasma tumor DNA detection was associated with shorter OS [hazard ratio (HR): 2.89, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.77-4.73, P ≤ 0.0001] and PFS (HR: 2.05; 95% CI: 1.36-3.11, P < 0.001). Using a multivariable model including plasma tumor DNA, patients who had a TP53, RB1 or PTEN gene alteration pre-treatment and at C2D1 had a significantly shorter OS than patients with no alteration at either time point (TP53: HR 7.13, 95% CI 2.37-21.47, P < 0.001; RB1: HR 6.24, 95% CI 1.97-19.73, P = 0.002; PTEN: HR 11.9, 95% CI 3.6-39.34, P < 0.001). Patients who were positive pre-treatment and converted to undetectable had no evidence of a difference in survival compared with those who were undetectable pre-treatment (P = 0.48, P = 0.43, P = 0.5, respectively). Progression samples harbored AR gain in all patients who had gain pre-treatment (9/49) and de novo AR somatic point mutations were detected in 8/49 patients.

A new technique for measuring the PSD is microfluidic resistive pulse sensing (MRPS). Because specific guidelines for measuring EVs together with other particles in biofluids with MRPS are lacking, we developed an operating procedure to reproducibly measure the PSD. The PSDs of particles in human plasma, conditioned medium of PC3 prostate cancer cell line (PC3 CM), and human urine were measured with MRPS (nCS1, Spectradyne LLC) to investigate: (i) the optimal diluent that reduces the interfacial tension of the sample while keeping EVs intact, (ii) the lower limit of detection (LoD) of particle size, (iii) the reproducibility of the PSD, (iv) the optimal dilution for measuring the PSD, and (v) the agreement in measured concentration between microfluidic cartridges with overlapping detection ranges. We found that the optimal diluent is 0.1% bovine serum albumin (w/v) in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. Based on the shape of the PSD, which is expected to follow a power-law function within the full detection range, we obtained a lower LoD of 75 nm for plasma and PC3 CM and 65 nm for urine. Normalized PSDs are reproducible (R2 > 0.950) at dilutions between 10-100x for plasma, 5-20x for PC3 CM, and 2-4x for urine. Furthermore, sample dilution does not impact the dilution-corrected concentration when the microfluidic cartridges are operated within their specified concentration ranges. PSDs from microfluidic cartridges with overlapping detection ranges agreed well (R2 > 0.936) and when combined the overall PSD spanned 5 orders of magnitude of measured concentration.

The objective of this study was to characterize current racial disparities in prostate cancer screening and referral from primary care to urology for prostate cancer concern within our large, integrated health care system.  Materials and methods:   This retrospective cohort study used data from Atrium Health's enterprise data warehouse, which includes patient information from more than 900 care locations across North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia. We included all men seen in the ambulatory or outpatient setting between 2014 and 2019 who were ≥40 years old. Clinical and demographic data were collected for all men, including age and race. Racial outcomes were reported for all groups with >2% representation in the population. Between-group comparisons were determined using chi-squared analysis, Wilcoxon rank sum testing and multivariable logistic regression, with significance defined as p <0.05.  Results:   We observed a significant decrease in prostate specific antigen testing across all age and racial groups in a cohort of 606,985 men at Atrium Health, including 87,189 Black men, with an overall relative decline of 56%. As compared to White men, Black men were more likely to undergo prostate specific antigen testing (adjusted OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.22-1.26) and be referred to urology for prostate cancer (adjusted OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.75-2.16).  Conclusions:   There was a continued significant decline in prostate cancer screening between 2014 and 2019. Despite having modestly elevated odds of being screened for prostate cancer compared to White men, Black men are relatively underscreened when considering that those who undergo prostate specific antigen screening are more likely to be referred by primary care to urology for additional prostate cancer diagnostic evaluation.""","""['Caroline D Lu', 'Oluwaseun Adeyemi', 'William E Anderson', 'Timothy C Hetherington', 'David C Slawson', 'Hazel Tapp', 'Tara A Eaton', 'Earle F Burgess', 'Claud M Grigg', 'Jason Z Zhu', 'Kris E Gaston', 'Stephen B Riggs', 'Peter E Clark', 'Yhenneko J Taylor', 'James T Kearns']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Prostate Cancer Outcomes in the Veterans Affairs Health Care System.', 'Determinants of Prostate Specific Antigen Screening among Black Men in the United States in the Contemporary Era.', 'Do racial disparities exist in the use of prostate cancer screening and detection tools in veterans?', 'Prostate cancer disparities in South Carolina: early detection, special programs, and descriptive epidemiology.', 'Racial disparities in Black men with prostate cancer: A literature review.', 'Assessing how lung cancer screening guidelines contribute to racial disparities in screening access.', 'Evaluation of Social Determinants of Health and Prostate Cancer Outcomes Among Black and White Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Increasing aggressive prostate cancer.']"""

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent a large family of disease- and tissue-specific transcripts, most of which are still functionally uncharacterized. Thus, we set out to identify the highly conserved lncRNAs that play a central role in NEPC pathogenesis. To this end, we performed transcriptomic analyses of donor-matched patient-derived xenograft models (PDXs) with immunohistologic features of prostate adenocarcinoma (AR+ /PSA+ ) or NEPC (AR- /SYN+ /CHGA+ ) and through differential expression analyses identified lncRNAs that were upregulated upon neuroendocrine transdifferentiation. These genes were prioritized for functional assessment based on the level of conservation in vertebrates. Here, LINC00261 emerged as the top gene with over 3229-fold upregulation in NEPC. Consistently, LINC00261 expression was significantly upregulated in NEPC specimens in multiple patient cohorts. Knockdown of LINC00261 in PC-3 cells dramatically attenuated its proliferative and metastatic abilities, which are explained by parallel downregulation of CBX2 and FOXA2 through distinct molecular mechanisms. In the cell cytoplasm, LINC00261 binds to and sequesters miR-8485 from targeting the CBX2 mRNA, while inside the nucleus, LINC00261 functions as a transcriptional scaffold to induce SMAD-driven expression of the FOXA2 gene. For the first time, these results demonstrate hyperactivation of the LINC00261-CBX2-FOXA2 axes in NEPC to drive proliferation and metastasis, and that LINC00261 may be utilized as a therapeutic target and a biomarker for this incurable disease.""","""['Rebecca L Mather', 'Abhijit Parolia', 'Sandra E Carson', 'Erik Venalainen', 'David Roig-Carles', 'Mustapha Jaber', 'Shih-Chun Chu', 'Ilaria Alborelli', 'Rebecca Wu', 'Dong Lin', 'Noushin Nabavi', 'Elena Jachetti', 'Mario P Colombo', 'Hui Xue', 'Perla Pucci', 'Xinpei Ci', 'Cheryl Hawkes', 'Yinglei Li', 'Hardev Pandha', 'Igor Ulitsky', 'Crystal Marconett', 'Luca Quagliata', 'Wei Jiang', 'Ignacio Romero', 'Yuzhuo Wang', 'Francesco Crea']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Mol Oncol""","""['The long noncoding RNA landscape of neuroendocrine prostate cancer and its clinical implications.', 'The long noncoding RNA H19 regulates tumor plasticity in neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Histone demethylase PHF8 drives neuroendocrine prostate cancer progression by epigenetically upregulating FOXA2.', 'The role of epigenetics and long noncoding RNA MIAT in neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Molecular model for neuroendocrine prostate cancer progression.', 'Calcium signalling pathways in prostate cancer initiation and progression.', 'Chromobox proteins in cancer: Multifaceted functions and strategies for modulation (Review).', 'Marine Natural Products with Activities against Prostate Cancer: Recent Discoveries.', 'Mechanism of piR-1245/PIWI-like protein-2 regulating Janus kinase-2/signal transducer and activator of transcription-3/vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway in retinal neovascularization.', 'The Role of Long Non-Coding RNAs in Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition-Related Signaling Pathways in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Results:   A total of 867 patients were included in this retrospective study, including 188 African American and 669 Caucasian patients. There was no significant difference in the likelihood of a pathogenic or likely-pathogenic variants (PV/LPVs) between African American and Caucasian patients (p = .09). African American patients were more likely to have a variant of unknown significance than Caucasians (odds ratio [OR] = 1.95; p < .0001). BRCA1 PV/LPVs were higher in African Americans (OR = 4.86; p = .04). African American patients were less likely to have a PV/LPV in non-BRCA DNA repair genes (OR = 0.30; p = .008). Family history of breast (OR = 2.09; p = .002) or ovarian cancer (OR = 2.33; p = .04) predicted PV/LPVs in Caucasians but not African-Americans.

Methods:   Consecutive MRI exams of patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for PCa were retrospectively collected from three institutions. Axial T2-weighted and apparent diffusion coefficient map images were annotated to obtain index lesion volumes of interest for radiomics feature extraction. Data from one institution was used for training, feature selection (using reproducibility, variance and pairwise correlation analyses, and a correlation-based subset evaluator), and tuning of a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, with stratified 10-fold cross-validation. The model was tested on the two remaining institutions' data and compared with a baseline reference and expert radiologist assessment of EPE.  Results:   In total, 193 patients were included. From an initial dataset of 2436 features, 2287 were excluded due to either poor stability, low variance, or high collinearity. Among the remaining, 14 features were used to train the ML model, which reached an overall accuracy of 83% in the training set.

In addition, this dimer showed cancer-type selectivity towards melanoma compared to prostate (PC3) and breast (MDA-MB-231) tumors. The occurrence of a radical mechanism was hypothesized by DFO and EPR analyses.

In prostate and breast cancers, bone is the most common site of cancer cell dissemination. Key steps in the metastatic cascade are promoted through upregulation of critical cell signaling pathways in neoplastic cells. The present study assessed the role of the receptor tyrosine kinase Axl in prostate and breast cancer cell metastasis to bones using (i) Axl knockdown neoplastic cells and osteoclast progenitor cells in vitro, (ii) intracardiac injection of Axl knockdown tumor cells in vivo, and (iii) selective Axl inhibitor BGB324. Axl inhibition in neoplastic cells significantly decreased their metastatic potential, and suppression of Axl signaling in osteoclast precursor cells also reduced the formation of mature osteoclasts. In vivo, Axl knockdown in prostate and breast cancer cells significantly suppressed the formation and progression of bone metastases.

While several miRNAs have been reported to regulate the development of tumors, the molecular mechanisms and roles of miR-149-5p in prostate carcinoma (PCa) remain unclear. Our aim was to investigate the interaction and functions of miR-149-5p and RGS17 in PCa.  Methods:   Microarray analysis was performed to identify the key miRNA and gene involved in PCa progression. The expression levels of miRNA and mRNA in PCa tissues and cells were verified by qRT-PCR. MTT assay, BrdU proliferation assay and wound-healing assay were applied to assess the effect of miR-149-5p and RGS17 on PCa cells' viability, proliferation, and migration ability. The association between RGS17 and miR-149-5p was identify using dual-luciferase reporter assay and Western blot assay.  Results:   Data analysis indicated the reduction of miR-149-5p expression in PCa tissues and cells. Experimental investigations also showed that this miRNA suppressed the viability, proliferation and migration ability of PCa cells. RGS17 was found to be the target of miR-149-5p, and the low expression of miR-149-5p upregulated RGS17 in PCa tissues and cells. The results of the cell-function assays showed that RGS17 acted as an oncogene in PCa even though its promotive effect could be reversed by miR-149-5p.

Recent epidemiological studies have found that inhibition of cholesterol synthesis may have beneficial effects on prostate cancer (PCa) patients, especially patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). We evaluated statins' effect on prostate cancer prognosis among patients treated with ADT.  Materials and methods:   Our study population consisted of 8253 PCa patients detected among the study population of the Finnish randomized study of screening for prostate cancer. These were limited to 4428 men who initiated ADT during the follow-up. Cox proportional regression model adjusted for tumor clinical characteristics and comorbidities was used to estimate hazard ratios for risk of PSA relapse after ADT initiation and prostate cancer death.  Results:   During the median follow-up of 6.3 years after the ADT initiation, there were 834 PCa deaths and 1565 PSA relapses in a study cohort. Statin use after ADT was associated with a decreased risk of PSA relapse (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.65-0.82) and prostate cancer death (HR 0.82; 95% CI 0.69-0.96). In contrast, statin use defined with a one-year lag (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.76-1.04), statin use before ADT initiation (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.96-1.31), and use in the first year on ADT (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.85-1.24) were not associated with prostate cancer death, without dose dependency.

We aimed to evaluate whether lymph node involvement on 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT prior to radical prostatectomy in patients with high-risk prostate cancer is associated with worse short-term oncologic outcomes.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 149 patients with high-risk localized or locoregional prostate cancer who underwent 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT prior to radical prostatectomy between 2015 and 2020. None of the patients received neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment. The study endpoints were PSA persistence and biochemical recurrence. Logistic regression models were used to identify preoperative predictors of PSA persistence. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to estimate biochemical recurrence-free survival.  Results:   Of 149 identified patients, 19 (13%) were found to have lymph node involvement on preoperative 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT for identifying pathologic lymph node involvement were 68%, 95%, and 92%, respectively. PSA persistence rate was lower among patients with PET-negative lymph nodes than those with PET-positive nodes (15 vs. 84%, p < 0.001). Positive nodes on imaging (OR = 41.03, p < 0.001) and clinical T2c-T3 stage (OR = 6.96, p = 0.002) were associated with PSA persistence on multivariable analysis. Among patients with PET-negative nodes the 1- and 2-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rates were 87% and 76%, respectively.

Dormant cancer cells exhibited increased porphyrin metabolism and sensitivity to 5-aminolevulinic acid-based photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT). However, the metabolic changes in dormant cancer cells or the factors that enhance porphyrin metabolism have not been fully clarified. In this study, we revealed that lipid metabolism was increased in dormant cancer cells, leading to ALA-PDT sensitivity. We performed microarray analysis in non-dormant and dormant cancer cells and revealed that lipid metabolism was remarkably enhanced in dormant cancer cells. In addition, triacsin C, a potent inhibitor of acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSs), reduced protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) accumulation and decreased ALA-PDT sensitivity.

Improving their loading capacity requires enhanced PTX solubilization. We compared the time-dependence of PTX membrane solubility as a function of PTX content in cationic liposomes (CLs) with lipid tails containing one (oleoyl; DOPC/DOTAP) or two (linoleoyl; DLinPC/newly synthesized DLinTAP) cis double bonds by using microscopy to generate kinetic phase diagrams. The DLin lipids displayed significantly increased PTX membrane solubility over DO lipids. Remarkably, 8 mol% PTX in DLinTAP/DLinPC CLs remained soluble for approximately as long as 3 mol% PTX (the solubility limit, which has been the focus of most previous studies and clinical trials) in DOTAP/DOPC CLs. The increase in solubility is likely caused by enhanced molecular affinity between lipid tails and PTX, rather than by the transition in membrane structure from bilayers to inverse cylindrical micelles observed with small-angle X-ray scattering. Importantly, the efficacy of PTX-loaded CLs against prostate cancer cells (their IC50 of PTX cytotoxicity) was unaffected by changing the lipid tails, and toxicity of the CL carrier was negligible. Moreover, efficacy was approximately doubled against melanoma cells for PTX-loaded DLinTAP/DLinPC over DOTAP/DOPC CLs. Our findings demonstrate the potential of chemical modifications of the lipid tails to increase the PTX membrane loading while maintaining (and in some cases even increasing) the efficacy of CLs.

The aims of this phase I study were to investigate 68Ga-SB3 PET/CT imaging of primary PCa tumors and assess safety. More aims included an investigation of biodistribution and dosimetry and a comparison with pathology and GRPr expression. Methods: Ten therapy-naïve, biopsy-confirmed PCa patients planned for prostatectomy were included. A 3-h extensive PET/CT imaging protocol was performed within 2 wk before prostatectomy. Prostate tissue was evaluated for tumor localization and Gleason score, and in vitro autoradiography was performed to determine GRPr expression. Available MRI scans performed within 3 mo before the study were matched. For dosimetry, residence times were estimated and effective dose to the body as well as absorbed doses to organs were calculated using the IDAC dose model, version 2.1. Results: Administration of 68Ga-SB3 (187.4 ± 40.0 MBq, 40 ± 5 μg) was well tolerated; no significant changes in vital signs or laboratory results were observed. 68Ga-SB3 PET/CT showed lesions in 8 of 10 patients. Pathologic analysis revealed a total of 16 tumor lesions, of which PET/CT showed 14, resulting in a sensitivity of 88%. 68Ga-SB3 PET/CT imaging showed uptake in 2 large prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia foci, considered a precursor to PCa, resulting in an 88% specificity. Autoradiography of tumor lesions revealed heterogeneous GRPr expression and was negative in 4 patients. Both PET/CT-negative patients had a GRPr-negative tumor. In autoradiography-positive tumors, the level of GRPr expression showed a significant correlation to tracer uptake on PET/CT. Dosimetry calculations estimated the effective dose to be 0.0144 mSv/MBq, similar to other 68Ga-labeled radiopeptides. The highest absorbed dose was detected in the physiologic GRPr-expressing pancreas (0.198 mGy/MBq), followed by the bladder wall and kidneys.

Cases were enrolled in presurgical weight-loss trials for breast (NCT02224807) and prostate (NCT01886677) cancers and had a body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m2. Cancer-free controls were matched 1:1 by age (±5 years), race, gender, and BMI (±5 kg/m2). All participants provided faecal samples; isolated bacterial DNA were PCR amplified at the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene and analysed using the QIIME pipeline. Tests compared cases versus controls, then separately by gender. Microbial alpha-diversity and beta-diversity were assessed, and relative abundance of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU's) were compared at the genus level, with false discovery rate (FDR) correction. 22 overweight and obese cancer patients were matched with 22 cancer-free controls, with an average BMI of 30.5±4.3 kg/m2, age 54.4±5.3 years, and 54.5% were black. Fourteen matches were made between breast cancer cases and healthy female controls, and 8 matches were made with prostate cancer cases and healthy male controls. Comparison of all cases and controls revealed no differences in alpha diversity, though prostate cancer patients had higher Chao1 (P=0.006) and Observed Species (P=0.036) than cancer-free males. Beta-diversity metrics were significantly different between cases and controls (P<0.03 for all tests in whole sample and in men), though only unweighted Unifrac was different in women (P=0.005).

Early oncologic outcomes and prognostic risk factors for relapse are demonstrated.  Objectives and methods:   A total of 32 patients underwent open resection of locoregional prostate cancer recurrence in seminal vesicles, as documented on either MRI, 11C-choline, or 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scans. Age, PSA-DT, PSA, and time to recurrence after primary treatment resection status were used in a uni- and multivariate Cox regression analysis for biochemical relapse after surgery.  Results:   Median patient age at time of salvage surgery was 70 (57-77) years. Median PSA and PSA-DT was 2.79 (0.4-61.54) ng/mL and 5.4 (1.6-20.1) months, respectively. Median surgical time and hospital stay was 132 (75-313) min and 5.5 (4-13) days, respectively. After a mean follow-up of 29 (2-92) months, 3 patients died at 8, 14, and 40 months after salvage surgery, and 6 (18.75%) patients remain without biochemical relapse and further treatment. Median progression-free survival was 12 (1-81) months. In the univariable Cox regression analysis, age at time of surgery, preoperative PSA, and the time from primary treatment to salvage surgery were identified as significant parameters for biochemical relapse. Only the interval from primary to salvage surgery was significant in the multivariate analysis with a hazard ratio of 1.008 (95% CI: 1.001-1.015, p = 0.018). In the entire cohort, 4 adjunctive surgeries (3 ureteroneocystostomies and 1 nephrectomy) were needed due to local progressive disease.  Conclusion:   Seminal vesicle resection is feasible with no significant intra- or postoperative complications. Almost all patients progressed to biochemical or systemic relapse. Salvage surgery must be seen as a preventive for local symptoms, in our experience most often postrenal ipsilateral obstruction.""","""['David Pfister', 'Tim Nestler', 'Florian Hartmann', 'Friederike Haidl', 'Jasmin Pullankavumkal', 'Matthias Schmidt', 'Axel Heidenreich']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Urol Int""","""['Salvage Surgery in Patients with Local Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Comparison of hypofractionation and standard fractionation for post-prostatectomy salvage radiotherapy in patients with persistent PSA: single institution experience.', 'Adverse risk factors for salvage radiotherapy outcomes after radical prostatectomy in prostate cancer patients.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Progress to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) necessitates additional treatments. Abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or prednisolone (AAP) prolongs survival in chemotherapy-naive and docetaxel-experienced patients.  Objective:   To evaluate the real-world safety and efficacy of AAP as first-line and second-line [post-docetaxel only (AAP-PD)] treatment in patients with mCRPC.  Patients and methods:   The Prostate Cancer Registry (PCR) was a prospective, international, observational study of patients with mCRPC in routine clinical practice. Men aged ≥ 18 years with confirmed mCRPC were included. Baseline characteristics, safety (treatment-emergent adverse events, treatment-emergent severe adverse events), and efficacy [progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)] were analyzed.  Results:   At baseline, patients who received first-line AAP (n = 754) were generally older than patients who received AAP-PD (n = 354); median age was 76 years and 70 years, respectively. However, the rate of visceral metastasis was higher in the AAP-PD cohort than in the AAP cohort (17.7% vs. 9.6%, respectively). Demographics and disease characteristics of patients with baseline cardiovascular disease were similar to those of the overall registry population. Efficacy outcomes were similar for all patients, regardless of the line of AAP therapy. For first-line AAP and AAP-PD, respectively, the median PFS was 8.9 and 5.8 months for all patients and 9.1 and 6.0 months for patients with cardiovascular comorbidities; median OS was 27.1 and 23.4 months for all patients, and 27.4 and 23.1 months for patients with cardiovascular comorbidities. There were no unexpected adverse events in any patient subgroup.  Conclusions:   These real-world data complement the findings from randomized controlled trials, indicating that first- and second-line AAP is well tolerated and effective in patients with mCRPC, including those with underlying CV comorbidities.

Objective:   To estimate cancer incidences and deaths in the United States to the year 2040.  Design and setting:   This cross-sectional study's estimated projection analysis used population growth projections and current population-based cancer incidence and death rates to calculate the changes in incidences and deaths to the year 2040. Cancer-specific incidences and deaths in the US were estimated for the most common cancer types. Demographic cancer-specific delay-adjusted incidence rates from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program were combined with US Census Bureau population growth projections (2016) and average annual percentage changes in incidence and death rates. Statistical analyses were performed from July 2020 to February 2021.  Main outcomes and measures:   Total cancer incidences and deaths to the year 2040.  Results:   This study estimated that the most common cancers in 2040 will be breast (364 000 cases) with melanoma (219 000 cases) becoming the second most common cancer; lung, third (208 000 cases); colorectal remaining fourth (147 000 cases); and prostate cancer dropping to the fourteenth most common cancer (66 000 cases). Lung cancer (63 000 deaths) was estimated to continue as the leading cause of cancer-related death in 2040, with pancreatic cancer (46 000 deaths) and liver and intrahepatic bile duct cancer (41 000 deaths) surpassing colorectal cancer (34 000 deaths) to become the second and third most common causes of cancer-related death, respectively.

Initially implicated in storage and lipid trafficking in adipocytes, LDs are more recently recognized to fuel key functions associated with carcinogenesis and progression of several cancers, including prostate cancer (PCa). However, the mechanisms controlling LD accumulation in cancer are largely unknown. EPHB2, a tyrosine kinase (TKR) ephrin receptor has been proposed to have tumor suppressor functions in PCa, although the mechanisms responsible for these effects are unclear. Given that dysregulation in TRK signaling can result in glutaminolysis we postulated that EPHB2 might have potential effects on lipid metabolism. Knockdown strategies for EPHB2 were performed in prostate cancer cells to analyze the impact on the net lipid balance, proliferation, triacylglycerol-regulating proteins, effect on LD biogenesis, and intracellular localization of LDs. We found that EPHB2 protein expression in a panel of human-derived prostate cancer cell lines was inversely associated with in vivo cell aggressiveness. EPHB2 silencing increased the proliferation of prostate cancer cells and concurrently induced de novo LD accumulation in both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments as well as a ""shift"" on LD size distribution in newly formed lipid-rich organelles. Lipid challenge using oleic acid exacerbated the effects on the LD phenotype. Loss of EPHB2 directly regulated key proteins involved in maintaining lipid homeostasis including, increasing lipogenic DGAT1, DGAT2 and PLIN2 and decreasing lipolytic ATGL and PEDF. A DGAT1-specific inhibitor abrogated LD accumulation and proliferative effects induced by EPHB2 loss. In conclusion, we highlight a new anti-tumor function of EPHB2 in lipid metabolism through regulation of DGAT1 and ATGL in prostate cancer. Blockade of DGAT1 in EPHB2-deficient tumors appears to be effective in restoring the lipid balance and reducing tumor growth.""","""['Alejandro Morales', 'Max Greenberg', 'Francesca Nardi', 'Victoria Gil', 'Simon W Hayward', 'Susan E Crawford', 'Omar E Franco']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Lab Invest""","""['Adding fuel to the fire: The lipid droplet and its associated proteins in cancer progression.', 'Positive regulation of prostate cancer cell growth by lipid droplet forming and processing enzymes DGAT1 and ABHD5.', 'DGAT1 Inhibitor Suppresses Prostate Tumor Growth and Migration by Regulating Intracellular Lipids and Non-Centrosomal MTOC Protein GM130.', 'A unifying mathematical model of lipid droplet metabolism reveals key molecular players in the development of hepatic steatosis.', 'Role of DGAT enzymes in triacylglycerol metabolism.', 'Atherosclerosis, Diabetes Mellitus, and Cancer: Common Epidemiology, Shared Mechanisms, and Future Management.', 'Lipid droplet biogenesis and functions in health and disease.', 'Distinct features of two lipid droplets types in cell nuclei from patients with liver diseases.', 'Adding fuel to the fire: The lipid droplet and its associated proteins in cancer progression.', 'Dysregulation of cellular membrane homeostasis as a crucial modulator of cancer risk.']"""

For NCHT versus RP, the PFS hazard ratio (HR) = 0.11 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.02-0.51; P = .004) and HR = 0.016 (95% CI, 0.0015-0.17; P < .001); the rPFS HR = 0.088 (95% CI, 0.011-0.71; P = .023) and HR = 0.03 (95% CI, 0.0025-0.36; P = .006). Further, the median OS of the ST group was 44.6 months for ST versus RP, and it was 49.3 months for ST versus NCHT; it was not reached in either the NCHT or RP group. Furthermore, 17.65% and 47.06% patients had positive surgical margins in the NCHT and RP groups, respectively, and no therapy-related deaths were observed during the study period.  Conclusions:   PSM analysis revealed NCHT before RP in OMPC patients has potential therapeutic benefits with acceptable toxicities and lower incidence of postoperative positive surgical margins.""","""['Chenfei Chi', 'Liancheng Fan', 'Baijun Dong', 'Yinjie Zhu', 'Zhixiang Xin', 'Jiahua Pan', 'Wei Xue']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Radical Prostatectomy With and Without Neoadjuvant Chemohormonal Pretreatment for High-Risk Localized Prostate Cancer: A Comparative Propensity Score Matched Analysis.', 'Neoadjuvant chemohormonal therapy combined with radical prostatectomy and extended PLND for very high risk locally advanced prostate cancer: A retrospective comparative study.', 'Long-term results of a phase II study with neoadjuvant docetaxel chemotherapy and complete androgen blockade in locally advanced and high-risk prostate cancer.', 'The addition of chemotherapy in the definitive management of high risk prostate cancer.', 'Efficacy and Safety of Combined Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) and Docetaxel Compared with ADT Alone for Metastatic Hormone-Naive Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Neoadjuvant Chemohormonal Therapy in Prostate Cancer Before Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

To overcome this inconsistency, we introduce and evaluate the concept of the total biological dose, bEQDd.  Methods:   Daily computed tomography imaging of nine patients treated for prostate carcinoma with intensity-modulated radiotherapy was used to compute the delivered deformed dose on the basis of deformable image registration (DIR). We compared conventional dose accumulation (DA) with the newly introduced bEQDd, a new method of accumulating biological dose that considers each fraction dose and tissue radiobiology. We investigated the impact of the applied fractionation scheme (conventional/hypofractionated), uncertainties induced by the DIR and by the assigned α/β-value.  Results:   bEQDd was systematically higher than the conventionally accumulated dose with difference hot spots of 3.3-4.9 Gy detected in six out of nine patients in regions of high dose gradient in the bladder and rectum. For hypofractionation, differences are up to 8.4 Gy. The difference amplitude was found to be in a similar range to worst-case uncertainties induced by DIR and was higher than that induced by α/β.  Conclusion:   Using bEQDd for dose accumulation overcomes a potential systematic inaccuracy in biological effect prediction based on accumulated dose. Highest impact is found for serial-type late responding organs at risk in dose gradient regions and for hypofractionation. Although hot spot differences are in the order of several Gray, in dose-volume parameters there is little difference compared with using conventional or biological DA. However, when local dose information is used, e.g. dose surface maps, difference hot spots can potentially change outcomes of dose-response modelling and adaptive treatment strategies.""","""['Nina I Niebuhr', 'Mona Splinter', 'Tilman Bostel', 'Joao Seco', 'Clemens M Hentschke', 'Ralf O Floca', 'Juliane Hörner-Rieber', 'Markus Alber', 'Peter Huber', 'Nils H Nicolay#', 'Asja Pfaffenberger#']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Uncertainties of deformable image registration for dose accumulation of high-dose regions in bladder and rectum in locally advanced cervical cancer.', 'Current status of intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: History, clinical results and future directions.', 'Dosimetric and radiobiological consequences of computed tomography-guided adaptive strategies for intensity modulated radiation therapy of the prostate.', 'Validation of a deformable image registration technique for cone beam CT-based dose verification.', 'Standard versus hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: assessing the impact on dose modulation and normal tissue effects when using patient-specific cancer biology.', 'Robust Beam Selection Based on Water Equivalent Thickness Analysis in Passive Scattering Carbon-Ion Radiotherapy for Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Radiomic and Dosiomic Features for the Prediction of Radiation Pneumonitis Across Esophageal Cancer and Lung Cancer.', 'Biological dosiomic features for the prediction of radiation pneumonitis in esophageal cancer patients.']"""

Presymptomatic identification of high-risk individuals can prompt earlier intervention and improve long-term outcomes. Objectives: To develop a model to predict a future diagnosis of lung cancer on the basis of routine clinical and laboratory data by using machine learning. Methods: We assembled data from 6,505 case patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 189,597 contemporaneous control subjects and compared the accuracy of a novel machine learning model with a modified version of the well-validated 2012 Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial risk model (mPLCOm2012), by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and diagnostic odds ratio (OR) as measures of model performance. Measurements and Main Results: Among ever-smokers in the test set, a machine learning model was more accurate than the mPLCOm2012 for identifying NSCLC 9-12 months before clinical diagnosis (P < 0.00001) and demonstrated an AUC of 0.86, a diagnostic OR of 12.3, and a sensitivity of 40.1% at a predefined specificity of 95%. In comparison, the mPLCOm2012 demonstrated an AUC of 0.79, an OR of 7.4, and a sensitivity of 27.9% at the same specificity. The machine learning model was more accurate than standard eligibility criteria for lung cancer screening and more accurate than the mPLCOm2012 when applied to a screening-eligible population. Influential model variables included known risk factors and novel predictors such as white blood cell and platelet counts. Conclusions: A machine learning model was more accurate for early diagnosis of NSCLC than either standard eligibility criteria for screening or the mPLCOm2012, demonstrating the potential to help prevent lung cancer deaths through early detection.""","""['Michael K Gould', 'Brian Z Huang', 'Martin C Tammemagi', 'Yaron Kinar', 'Ron Shiff']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Am J Respir Crit Care Med""","""['Electronic Health Records and Machine Learning for Early Detection of Lung Cancer and Other Conditions: Thinking about the Path Ahead.', 'Diagnostic Value of Serum miR-182, miR-183, miR-210, and miR-126 Levels in Patients with Early-Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'CTAPIII/CXCL7: a novel biomarker for early diagnosis of lung cancer.', 'Early Colorectal Cancer Detected by Machine Learning Model Using Gender, Age, and Complete Blood Count Data.', 'Machine Learning for Lung Cancer Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prognosis.', 'A Review on Lung Cancer Diagnosis Using Data Mining Algorithms.', 'Interpretable prediction of cardiopulmonary complications after non-small cell lung cancer surgery based on machine learning and SHapley additive exPlanations.', ""Efficient clinical data analysis for prediction of coal workers' pneumoconiosis using machine learning algorithms."", 'Prognostic models for upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma patients after radical nephroureterectomy based on a novel systemic immune-inflammation score with machine learning.', 'Performance evaluation of deep learning techniques for lung cancer prediction.', 'Novel Biomarker Prediction for Lung Cancer Using Random Forest Classifiers.']"""

Methods:   Seventy-five men treated with RT with or without 6 months of ADT for unfavorable-risk nonmetastatic PC enrolled in 2 prospective clinical trials between 1986 and 2001 formed the study cohort. Competing risks and Cox multivariable regression were used to assess whether low versus normal serum testosterone at the time of PSA failure and higher PSAn after initial therapy were independently associated with the risk of PC-specific (PCSM) and all-cause mortality (ACM) adjusting for PC prognostic factors.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 15.34 years (interquartile range, 6.66-16.88 years), there were 53 deaths (73.3%): 30 (56.6%) were from PC. Low testosterone at PSA failure was significantly associated with an increased risk of PCSM (adjusted HR [AHR], 7.77; 95% CI, 1.14-52.99; P = .04) and ACM (AHR, 3.01; 95% CI, 1.01-8.96; P = .05), as was higher PSAn (PCSM AHR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.05; P < .01; ACM AHR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02-1.07; P < .01), although the prognostic significance of PSAn was only noted in men with a normal testosterone at PSA failure.  Conclusions:   Low testosterone level at PSA failure in high-risk patients with PC treated with RT is associated with increased PCSM and ACM risk. In men with normal testosterone levels at the time of PSA failure, an elevated PSAn was associated with worse PCSM and ACM risk.  Lay summary:   This study investigates whether the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir and normal versus low testosterone at the time of PSA failure provide mutually exclusive or overlapping prognostic information following treatment with radiation and androgen deprivation therapy for unfavorable-risk patients with prostate cancer using data from 2 prospective clinical trials.

We assembled Stacks assays to investigate tumor-monocyte interactions, re-education of activated macrophages, and neutrophil infiltration. For the first time in vitro, the Stacks infiltration assays reveal that primary tumor-associated fibroblasts from specific patients differ from that associated with the benign region of the prostate in their ability to limit neutrophil infiltration as well as facilitate monocyte adhesion and anti-inflammatory monocyte polarization.

EnR can be mediated by androgen receptor (AR) splice variants, with AR splice variant 7 (AR-V7) arguably the most clinically important variant. In this study, we determined proteins key to generating AR-V7, validated our findings using clinical samples, and studied splicing regulatory mechanisms in prostate cancer models. Triangulation studies identified JMJD6 as a key regulator of AR-V7, as evidenced by its upregulation with in vitro EnR, its downregulation alongside AR-V7 by bromodomain inhibition, and its identification as a top hit of a targeted siRNA screen of spliceosome-related genes. JMJD6 protein levels increased (P < 0.001) with castration resistance and were associated with higher AR-V7 levels and shorter survival (P = 0.048). JMJD6 knockdown reduced prostate cancer cell growth, AR-V7 levels, and recruitment of U2AF65 to AR pre-mRNA. Mutagenesis studies suggested that JMJD6 activity is key to the generation of AR-V7, with the catalytic machinery residing within a druggable pocket. Taken together, these data highlight the relationship between JMJD6 and AR-V7 in advanced prostate cancer and support further evaluation of JMJD6 as a therapeutic target in this disease.

Results:   Compared with the original IGCCCG publication, 5-year PFS remained similar in patients with good prognosis with 89% (87%-91%) versus 90% (95% CI, 89 to 91), but the 5-year OS increased from 92% (90%-94%) to 96% (95%-96%). In patients with intermediate prognosis, PFS remained similar with 75% (71%-79%) versus 78% (76%-80%) and the OS increased from 80% (76%-84%) to 89% (88%-91%). In patients with poor prognosis, the PFS increased from 41% (95% CI, 35 to 47) to 54% (95% CI, 52 to 56) and the OS from 48% (95% CI, 42 to 54) to 67% (95% CI, 65 to 69). A more granular prognostic model was developed and independently validated. This model identified a new cutoff of lactate dehydrogenase at a 2.5 upper limit of normal and increasing age and presence of lung metastases as additional adverse prognostic factors. An online calculator is provided (https://www.eortc.org/IGCCCG-Update).  Conclusion:   The IGCCCG Update model improves individual prognostication in metastatic nonseminomatous germ cell tumors. Increasing age and lung metastases add granularity to the original IGCCCG classification as adverse prognostic factors.""","""['Silke Gillessen', 'Nicolas Sauvé', 'Laurence Collette', 'Gedske Daugaard', 'Ronald de Wit', 'Costantine Albany', 'Alexey Tryakin', 'Karim Fizazi', 'Olof Stahl', 'Jourik A Gietema', 'Ugo De Giorgi', 'Fay H Cafferty', 'Aaron R Hansen', 'Torgrim Tandstad', 'Robert A Huddart', 'Andrea Necchi', 'Christopher J Sweeney', 'Xavier Garcia-Del-Muro', 'Daniel Y C Heng', 'Anja Lorch', 'Michal Chovanec', 'Eric Winquist', 'Peter Grimison', 'Darren R Feldman', 'Angelika Terbuch', 'Marcus Hentrich', 'Carsten Bokemeyer', 'Helene Negaard', 'Christian Fankhauser', 'Jonathan Shamash', 'David J Vaughn', 'Cora N Sternberg', 'Axel Heidenreich', 'Jörg Beyer;International Germ Cell Cancer Classification Update Consortium']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Erratum.', 'Survival and New Prognosticators in Metastatic Seminoma: Results From the IGCCCG-Update Consortium.', 'Prognostic Factors and Treatment Results After Bleomycin, Etoposide, and Cisplatin in Germ Cell Cancer: A Population-based Study.', 'The prognostic impact of different tumor marker levels in nonseminomatous germ cell tumor patients with intermediate prognosis: A registry of the International Global Germ Cell Tumor Collaborative Group (G3).', 'Intensive chemotherapy in poor-prognosis nonseminomatous germ cell tumors of the testis.', 'Intensive induction chemotherapy with CBOP/BEP in patients with poor prognosis germ cell tumors.', 'Onco-TESE (Testicular Sperm Extraction): Insights from a Tertiary Center and Comprehensive Literature Analysis.', 'Unveiling the genomic landscape of possible metastatic malignant transformation of teratoma secondary to cisplatin-chemotherapy: a Tempus gene analysis-based case report literature review.', 'Case of extragonadal germ cell tumor mimicking left adrenal tumor.', 'A case of testicular cancer with retroperitoneal lymph node metastasis of teratoma with somatic-type malignancy 18\u2009years after initial treatment.', 'Cardiovascular Disease in Testicular Cancer Survivors: Identification of Risk Factors and Impact on Quality of Life.']"""

However, existing methods to identify treatments are often lacking. We develop a natural language processing approach with structured electronic medical records and unstructured clinical notes to identify the initial treatment administered to patients with cancer.  Methods:   We used a total number of 4,412 patients with 483,782 clinical notes from the Stanford Cancer Institute Research Database containing patients with nonmetastatic prostate, oropharynx, and esophagus cancer. We trained treatment identification models for each cancer type separately and compared performance of using only structured, only unstructured (bag-of-words, doc2vec, fasttext), and combinations of both (structured + bow, structured + doc2vec, structured + fasttext). We optimized the identification model among five machine learning methods (logistic regression, multilayer perceptrons, random forest, support vector machines, and stochastic gradient boosting). The treatment information recorded in the cancer registry is the gold standard and compares our methods to an identification baseline with billing codes.  Results:   For prostate cancer, we achieved an f1-score of 0.99 (95% CI, 0.97 to 1.00) for radiation and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.99 to 1.00) for surgery using structured + doc2vec. For oropharynx cancer, we achieved an f1-score of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.58 to 0.93) for chemoradiation and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.69 to 0.95) for surgery using doc2vec. For esophagus cancer, we achieved an f1-score of 1.0 (95% CI, 1.0 to 1.0) for both chemoradiation and surgery using all combinations of structured and unstructured data. We found that employing the free-text clinical notes outperforms using the billing codes or only structured data for all three cancer types.  Conclusion:   Our results show that treatment identification using free-text clinical notes greatly improves upon the performance using billing codes and simple structured data. The approach can be used for treatment cohort identification and adapted for longitudinal cancer treatment identification.""","""['Jiaming Zeng', 'Imon Banerjee', 'A Solomon Henry', 'Douglas J Wood', 'Ross D Shachter', 'Michael F Gensheimer', 'Daniel L Rubin']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""JCO Clin Cancer Inform""","""['Looking for low vision: Predicting visual prognosis by fusing structured and free-text data from electronic health records.', 'Predicting near-term glaucoma progression: An artificial intelligence approach using clinical free-text notes and data from electronic health records.', 'Deep Learning Approaches for Predicting Glaucoma Progression Using Electronic Health Records and Natural Language Processing.', 'Diagnosing post-traumatic stress disorder using electronic medical record data.', 'Review: A Roadmap to Use Nonstructured Data to Discover Multitarget Cancer Therapies.', 'DeepPhe-CR: Natural Language Processing Software Services for Cancer Registrar Case Abstraction.', 'Demystifying the Role of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Smart City Applications: Background, Motivation, Recent Advances, and Future Research Directions.', 'The Utility of Oncology Information Systems for Prognostic Modelling in Head and Neck Cancer.', 'Empirical comparison of routinely collected electronic health record data for head and neck cancer-specific survival in machine-learnt prognostic models.', 'Introducing AI to the molecular tumor board: one direction toward the establishment of precision medicine using large-scale cancer clinical and biological information.']"""

The transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is implicated as a metastatic driver, but its potential as therapeutic target in bone metastasis has not been investigated. In this study, we evaluated for the first time a STAT3 inhibitor, Napabucasin, as a therapeutic option for bone metastatic PC.  Methods:   Effects of STAT3 inhibitors, Stattic and Napabucasin, on metastatic potential in PC cells were studied in vitro by assessment of migration capacity, self-renewal potential, and tumorsphere formation. For evaluation of the role of STAT3 in initial skeletal establishment of PC cells as well as in progressed castration-resistant PC (CRPC) in bone, human VCaP prostate cancer cells were inoculated in the tibia of mice which subsequently were treated with the STAT3 inhibitor Napabucasin. Bone specimens were analyzed using computed tomography (CT), immunohistochemistry, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction.  Results:   The small molecule STAT3 inhibitors Stattic and Napabucasin both effectively impaired metastatic potential of PC cells in vitro. Furthermore, treatment with Napabucasin prevented metastatic establishment in tibial bones in vivo and thereby also the tumor-induced sclerotic bone response seen in vehicle-treated VCaP xenografts. In addition, treatment with Napabucasin of established bone CRPC significantly decreased both tumor burden and tumor-induced trabecular bone volume compared with effects seen in vehicle-treated animals. Anti-mitotic effects were confirmed by decreased Ki67 staining in Napabucasin-treated xenografts compared with vehicle-treated xenografts. Alterations of gene expression in the femoral bone marrow (BM) niche toward the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells and the myeloid lineage were demonstrated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and were further reflected by a substantial increase in the number of erythrocytes in BM of Napabucasin-treated mice. Furthermore, a unique pattern of STAT3 phosphorylation in osteoblasts/stromal cells surrounding the areas of tumor cells was demonstrated immunohistochemically in bone xenograft models using several different PC cell lines.  Conclusion:   Inhibition of STAT3 activity disrupts the bone metastatic niche and targets both the skeletal establishment of PC and advanced bone metastatic CRPC in mice, suggesting STAT3 as a candidate for molecular targeted therapies of skeletal metastatic disease.""","""['Malin Hagberg Thulin', 'Jorma Määttä', 'Anna Linder', 'Simona Sterbova', 'Claes Ohlsson', 'Jan-Erik Damber', 'Anders Widmark', 'Emma Persson']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Napabucasin, a novel STAT3 inhibitor suppresses proliferation, invasion and stemness of glioblastoma cells.', 'STAT3 Inhibitor Napabucasin Inhibits Tumor Growth and Cooperates with Proteasome Inhibition in Human Ovarian Cancer Cells.', 'Suppression of prostate cancer progression by cancer cell stemness inhibitor napabucasin.', 'Napabucasin: An Update on the First-in-Class Cancer Stemness Inhibitor.', 'Molecular treatment strategies and surgical reconstruction for metastatic bone diseases.', 'Animal models of cancer metastasis to the bone.', 'Targeting PI3K/Akt signaling in prostate cancer therapy.', ""STAT3 and Its Pathways' Dysregulation-Underestimated Role in Urological Tumors."", 'Molecular Landscape of LncRNAs in Prostate Cancer: A focus on pathways and therapeutic targets for intervention.', 'Dual STAT‑3 and IL‑6R inhibition with stattic and tocilizumab decreases migration, invasion and proliferation of prostate cancer cells by targeting the IL‑6/IL‑6R/STAT‑3 axis.']"""

Herein, whole-genome sequencing was performed in a large PrCa family featuring multiple affected relatives spanning several generations. A rare, predicted splice site EZH2 variant, rs78589034 (G > A), was identified as segregating with disease in all but two individuals in the family, one of whom was affected with lymphoma and bowel cancer and a female relative. This variant was significantly associated with disease risk in combined familial and sporadic PrCa datasets (n = 1551; odds ratio [OR] = 3.55, P = 1.20 × 10-5 ). Transcriptome analysis was performed on prostate tumour needle biopsies available for two rare variant carriers and two wild-type cases. Although no allele-dependent differences were detected in EZH2 transcripts, a distinct differential gene expression signature was observed when comparing prostate tissue from the rare variant carriers with the wild-type samples. The gene expression signature comprised known downstream targets of EZH2 and included the top-ranked genes, DUSP1, FOS, JUNB and EGR1, which were subsequently validated by qPCR. These data provide evidence that rs78589034 is associated with increased PrCa risk in Tasmanian men and further, that this variant may be associated with perturbed EZH2 function in prostate tissue. Disrupted EZH2 function is a driver of tumourigenesis in several cancers, including prostate, and is of significant interest as a therapeutic target.""","""['Kelsie Raspin', 'Liesel M FitzGerald', 'James R Marthick', 'Matt A Field', 'Roslyn C Malley', 'Annette Banks', 'Shaun Donovan', 'Russell J Thomson', 'Georgea R Foley', 'Janet L Stanford', 'Joanne L Dickinson']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Prevalence of the HOXB13 G84E germline mutation in British men and correlation with prostate cancer risk, tumour characteristics and clinical outcomes.', 'HNF1B-mediated repression of SLUG is suppressed by EZH2 in aggressive prostate cancer.', 'An expanded variant list and assembly annotation identifies multiple novel coding and noncoding genes for prostate cancer risk using a normal prostate tissue eQTL data set.', 'Genetic predisposition to prostate cancer.', 'Updates in Prostate Cancer Research and Screening in Men at Genetically Higher Risk.', 'Clinical efficacy of prostate PI-RADS V2.1 score combined with serum PSA-related indicators in the detection of gray zone prostate cancer.', 'Exploring the Association Between PRC2 Genes Variants and Lung Cancer Risk in Chinese Han Population.', 'Recent advances in prostate cancer: WNT signaling, chromatin regulation, and transcriptional coregulators.']"""

However, it is currently reported that the angiogenesis of tumors can be induced by a low dosage of irradiation. Abiraterone is an oral anti-tumor agent for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In the present study, the anti-angiogenesis effect of Abiraterone against HUVECs incubated with irradiated lung cancer cell medium will be investigated. The HUVECs were incubated with a cultural medium of the NSCLC cell line-A549, Abiraterone-treated A549 cells, irradiation-treated A549 cells, and Abiraterone and irradiation co-treated A549 cells. The tolerable concentration of Abiraterone against HUVECs was determined using MTT assay. The migration and angiogenesis abilities of HUVECs were evaluated using transwell and tube formation assays, respectively. The expression levels of VEGF, MMP-2, and MMP-9 in the treated HUVECs were detected using qRT-PCR and ELISA. Western blot was used to determine the expressions of p-PI3K and p-AKT. The tolerable concentration of Abiraterone used in the present study was 50 nM. First, the migration rate and numbers of formed tubes were significantly decreased by the A549 medium treated with Abiraterone and elevated by the A549 medium treated with irradiation but greatly suppressed by the co-treatment with Abiraterone. Subsequently, VEGF, MMP-2, and MMP-9 were significantly downregulated by the A549 medium treated with Abiraterone and upregulated by the A549 medium treated with irradiation but greatly inhibited by the co-treatment with Abiraterone. Lastly, the activated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway induced by the A549 medium treated with irradiation was significantly suppressed by the A549 medium treated with both irradiation and Abiraterone.

Two recently reported large-scale randomized trials suggest that radiotherapy (RT) directed at the prostate improves overall survival (OS) in patients with low metastatic burden. We reviewed the experience of prostate RT in this setting at our center.  Methods:   The study population consisted of men with newly-diagnosed metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) referred to a comprehensive cancer center between 2005 and 2015 and treated initially with androgen deprivation therapy. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they received (1) prostate RT with biological effective dose (BED) at least that of a course of 40 Gy in 15 fractions or (2) no prostate RT. The association between receipt of prostate RT and OS was studied. OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression was used to identify factors associated with OS.  Results:   The cohort consisted of 410 patients, of whom 128 received prostate RT. Median follow-up 61.0 months. On univariate analysis, receipt of prostate RT was associated with improved OS (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.45-0.77, p = 0.0001). Median OS in those patients receiving prostate RT was 47.4 months versus 26.3 months in those not receiving prostate RT. In a multivariate Cox model, receipt of prostate RT remained associated with improved OS (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50-0.94, p = 0.02). In those treated with prostate RT, increasing BED was also associated with improved OS (HR 0.87 per 10 Gy increase, 95% CI 0.76-0.99, p = 0.03).

Neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation or chromosomal instability (CIN) may be additional mechanisms that mediate resistance.  Experimental design:   PROPHECY was a multicenter prospective study of men with high-risk mCRPC starting abiraterone or enzalutamide. A secondary objective was to assess Epic CTC CIN and NE phenotypes before abiraterone or enzalutamide and at progression. The proportional hazards (PH) model was used to investigate the prognostic importance of CIN and NE in predicting progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) adjusting for CTC number (CellSearch), AR-V7, prior therapy, and clinical risk score. The PH model was utilized to validate this association of NE with OS in an external dataset of patients treated similarly at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC; New York, NY).  Results:   We enrolled 118 men with mCRPC starting on abiraterone or enzalutamide; 107 were evaluable on the Epic platform. Of these, 36.4% and 8.4% were CIN positive and NE positive, respectively. CIN and NE were independently associated with worse OS [HR, 2.2; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-4.0 and HR 3.8; 95% CI, 1.2-12.3, respectively] when treated with abiraterone/enzalutamide. The prognostic significance of NE positivity for worse OS was confirmed in the MSKCC dataset (n = 173; HR, 5.7; 95% CI, 2.6-12.7).  Conclusions:   A high CIN and NE CTC phenotype is independently associated with worse survival in men with mCRPC treated with abiraterone/enzalutamide, warranting further prospective controlled predictive studies to inform treatment decisions.""","""['Landon C Brown#', 'Susan Halabi#', 'Joseph D Schonhoft', 'Qian Yang', 'Jun Luo', 'David M Nanus', 'Paraskevi Giannakakou', 'Russell Z Szmulewitz', 'Daniel C Danila', 'Ethan S Barnett', 'Emily A Carbone', 'Jimmy L Zhao', 'Patrick Healy', 'Monika Anand', 'Audrey Gill', 'Adam Jendrisak', 'William R Berry', 'Santosh Gupta', 'Simon G Gregory', 'Richard Wenstrup', 'Emmanuel S Antonarakis', 'Daniel J George', 'Howard I Scher', 'Andrew J Armstrong']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Prospective Multicenter Validation of Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 and Hormone Therapy Resistance in High-Risk Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: The PROPHECY Study.', 'Development and validation of circulating tumour cell enumeration (Epic Sciences) as a prognostic biomarker in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Circulating Tumor Cell Genomic Evolution and Hormone Therapy Outcomes in Men with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Germline DNA-repair Gene Mutations and Efficacy of Abiraterone or Enzalutamide in Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Revealing the prognostic landscape of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide: a meta-analysis.', 'PSMA-positive Circulating Tumor Cell Detection and Outcomes with Abiraterone or Enzalutamide Treatment in Men with Metastatic Castrate-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'A clinical-grade liquid biomarker detects neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer.', 'The Value of Phenotypic Precision Medicine in Prostate Cancer.', 'The Role of Epigenetic Change in Therapy-Induced Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer Lineage Plasticity.', 'Non-Invasive Profiling of Advanced Prostate Cancer via Multi-Parametric Liquid Biopsy and Radiomic Analysis.']"""

Methods:   From 2003 to 2019, favorable intermediate risk patients who underwent radical prostatectomy were included in this study. All patients were evaluated preoperatively with MRI. Using PI-RADS scores, patients were divided into two groups, and clinic-pathological outcomes were compared. The impact of preoperative factors on significant pathologic Gleason score upgrading (≥ 4 + 3) and biochemical recurrence were assessed via multivariate analysis. Subgroup analysis was performed in patients with PI-RADS ≤ 2.  Results:   Among the 239 patients, 116 (48.5%) were MRI-negative (PI-RADS ≤ 3) and 123 (51.5%) were MRI-positive (PI-RADS > 3). Six patients in the MRI-negative group (5.2%) were characterized as requiring significant pathologic Gleason score upgrading compared with 34 patients (27.6%) in the MRI-positive group (p < 0.001). PI-RADS score was shown to be a significant predictor of significant pathologic Gleason score upgrading (OR = 6.246, p < 0.001) and biochemical recurrence (HR = 2.595, p = 0.043). 10-years biochemical recurrence-free survival was estimated to be 84.4% and 72.6% in the MRI-negative and MRI-positive groups (p = 0.035).

The production of new generation vaccines for this disease has surprised even their most optimistic supporters. Not only have these vaccines proven to be effective, but the importance of this disease and pandemic situation also significantly shortened the long-standing process of validating such products. Vaccination is a type of immunotherapy. Researchers have long been looking at vaccines as a possible treatment for cancer (Geynisman et al., 2014). In the same way that vaccines work against infectious diseases, attempts are being made to develop vaccines to identify specific proteins on cancer cells. This helps the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells. Cancer vaccines may help: I) Prevent the growth of cancer cells (Bialkowski et al., 2016), II) Prevent recurrence of cancer (Stanton and Disis, 2015), III) Destroy cancer cells left over from other treatments. The following types of cancer vaccines are being studied: Antigen Vaccines. These vaccines are made from specific proteins or antigens of cancerous cells. Their purpose is to stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells (Tagliamonte et al., 2014). Whole-Cell Vaccines. A whole-cell vaccine uses the entire cancer cell, not just a specific molecule (antigen), to generate the vaccine. (Keenan and Jaffee, 2012).Dendritic Cell Vaccines. Dendritic cells help the immune system identify abnormal cells, such as cancerous cells. Dendritic cells are grown with cancer cells in the laboratory to produce the vaccine. The vaccine then stimulates the immune system to attack cancer. (Wang et al., 2014; Mastelic-Gavillet et al., 2019). DNA Vaccines. These vaccines are made from DNA fragments of cancer cells. They can be injected into the body to facilitate immune system cells can better respond and kill cancer cells (Gatti-Mays et al., 2017).Other Types of Cancer Vaccines. such as Anti idiotype vaccines. This vaccine stimulates the body to generate antibodies against cancerous cells. An example of an anti-idiotype antibody is Racotumomab or Vaxira (Cancer, 2016). However, conditions and considerations after Corona does not seem to be the same as before. The current pandemic situation has also led to major changes in the pharmaceutical and Vaccine production process and international protocols. Some of the most critical issues that can accelerate the introduction of cancer vaccines are: 1. Typical drug and vaccine development timeline. A typical vaccine needs 5 to 10 years and sometimes longer to design secure funding, and get approval (Figure 1). Less than 10 percent of new drugs, which are entered in the different phases of clinical trials, are advanced to approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)(Cancer, 2020a). However, now the situation is not normal. Dozens of Covid 19 vaccines are starting clinical trials. Some of them use RNA and DNA technology, which delivers the body with missions to produce its antibodies against the virus. There are already at least 254 therapies and 95 vaccines related to Covid-19 being explored. However, it seems that the experiences gained in this pandemic, and advances in technology, may be effective in shortening the production path of other vaccines and drugs and the process of its approval at the national and international levels in the future. In Figure 2, the time course of production of conventional vaccines in comparison with Covid 19 vaccines (Cancer, 2020b) is shown.2. The introduction of messenger RNA (mRNA) technology into the field of prevention and treatment. Over the past decades, this technology has been considered an excellent alternative to conventional vaccination methods. Proper potency and low side effects, the possibility of fast production and relatively low production cost are its advantages. However, until recently, the instability of this molecule has been a major problem in its application. This research was started many years ago by two companies that played a significant role in developing the first Covid vaccines, so BioNTech and Moderna were able to quickly transfer their experience in the field of Covid vaccine development (Pardi et al., 2018; Moderna, 2020). Figure 3 shows how mRNA vaccines work. Bout Pfizer &amp;ndash; BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines were more than 90 % effective in preclinical stages. Millions of doses of these two vaccines are currently being injected into eligible individuals worldwide. 3. Considering the use of artificial intelligence in assessing the effectiveness of vaccines. There are always doubts about the effectiveness of the new drug in treating the disease. Once the vaccine is widely available, we will know more about its effectiveness versus it works under carefully controlled scientific testing conditions. Vaccines will continue to be monitored after use. The data collected helps professionals understand how they work in different groups of people (depending on factors such as age, ethnicity, and people with different health conditions) and also the length of protection provided by the vaccine. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging field, which reaches everywhere and not only as a beneficial industrial tool but also as a practical tool in medical science and plays a crucial role in developing the computation vision, risk assessment, diagnostic, prognostic, etc. models in the field of medicine (Amisha et al., 2019). According to the wide range of AI applications in the analysis of different types of data, it can be used in vaccine production, safety assessments, clinical and preclinical studies and Covid 19 vaccines adverse reactions (CDC, 2019). Indeed, most cancer vaccines are therapeutic, rather than prophylactic, and seek to stimulate cell-mediated responses, such as those from CTLs, capable of clearing or reducing tumor burden. There are currently FDA-approved products for helping cancer treatment such as BREYANZI, TECARTUS and YESCARTA for lymphoma, IMLYGIC for melanoma, KYMRIAH for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and PROVENGE for prostate cancer. Over the past decade, most of BioNTech&amp;#39;s activities have been in the field of cancer vaccine design and production for melanoma (two clinical trials), breast cancer (one clinical trial), and the rest concerning viral and veterinary vaccines (two clinical trials). Also Maderno company has been working on Individualized cancer vaccines (one clinical trials), and vaccines for viral infections such as Zika and Influenza and veterinary vaccines (several clinical trials) (Pardi et al., 2018). Therefore, it can be said, mRNA technology that has been the subject of much research into the treatment of cancer has been shifted and rapidly used to produce and use the Covid 19 vaccine. The current pandemic situation has necessitated the acceleration of Covid 19 vaccines and drugs and national and international protocols for their approval. If the currently produced vaccines can continue to be as successful as the preclinical and early phase studies, these changes and evolution have raised hopes for accelerating the use of these technologies and mechanisms in the field of cancer and other diseases vaccines, including HIV and influenza.""","""['S Amanpour']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Arch Razi Inst""","""['COVID-19 vaccines: comparison of biological, pharmacological characteristics and adverse effects of Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Vaccines.', 'Effectiveness of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Vaccines in Preventing SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Nursing Home Residents Before and During Widespread Circulation of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) Variant - National Healthcare Safety Network, March 1-August 1, 2021.', 'Antibody levels following vaccination against SARS-CoV-2: associations with post-vaccination infection and risk factors in two UK longitudinal studies.', 'mRNA vaccine-induced T cells respond identically to SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern but differ in longevity and homing properties depending on prior infection status.', 'From COVID-19 to Cancer mRNA Vaccines: Moving From Bench to Clinic in the Vaccine Landscape.', 'Social Representations of Hesitant Brazilians about Vaccination against COVID-19.', 'An mRNA-based rabies vaccine induces strong protective immune responses in mice and dogs.', 'How far are the new wave of mRNA drugs from us? mRNA product current perspective and future development.', 'SARS-CoV-2 triggering autoimmune diseases.', 'Therapeutic Effect of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine on Melanoma Skin Metastases.']"""

After evaluation, 41 patients with absolute indications for surgical treatment or with suspected prostate cancer were excluded. After a comprehensive examination, 96 patients were prescribed tamsulosin 0.4 mg daily in combination with solifenacin 10 mg daily. All patients were followed up for 12 months.  Results:   As a result of using solifenacin, better control over storage symptoms was achieved according to the I-PSS scale (-4 points), which also led to a significant decrease in the total I-PSS score after 12 months of therapy.

Body fat distribution and timing of exposure may be relevant. We investigated associations between body size trajectories and PCa incidence in a population-based case-control study in Montreal, Canada.  Methods:   Cases (n = 1,931), aged ≤ 75 years, were diagnosed with PCa in 2005-2009; 1,994 controls were selected from the electoral list. Interviews were conducted to assess body mass index (BMI) and Stunkard's silhouette at ages 20, 40, 50, 60 years, and before interview. Current waist and hip circumferences were measured, and a predictive model estimated waist circumference in the past. BMI and waist circumference trajectories were determined to identify subgroups. Logistic regression estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between anthropometric indicators and PCa.  Results:   Subjects with a current BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 had a lower risk of overall PCa (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.59-0.85). Associations with adult BMI followed similar trends for less and more aggressive tumors, with stronger inverse relationships in early adulthood. Contrastingly, current waist circumference ≥ 102 cm was associated with elevated risk of high-grade PCa (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.03-1.71).

This was especially evident among men in the obese-increase group for BMI and waist circumference.  Conclusion:   Abdominal obesity increased the risk of aggressive PCa.

This study compares prespecified adverse events and metastasis-free survival associated with darolutamide vs apalutamide, and darolutamide vs enzalutamide, via matching-adjusted indirect comparisons.  Materials and methods:   Individual patient data from the phase III ARAMIS trial (NPLACEBO=553; NDAROLUTAMIDE=943) were selected and reweighted to match the inclusion criteria and baseline characteristics published for the phase III SPARTAN (NPLACEBO=401; NAPALUTAMIDE=806) and PROSPER (NPLACEBO=468; NENZALUTAMIDE=933) trials. Only baseline factors consistently reported across trials were included as matching covariates. Both indirect comparisons matched on age, prostate specific antigen level and doubling time, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, Gleason score, and bone-sparing agent use. Darolutamide vs apalutamide also matched on prior surgery and darolutamide vs enzalutamide also matched on region. Risk differences and odds ratios were calculated for adverse events and hazard ratios for metastasis-free survival.  Results:   No differences in metastasis-free survival hazard ratios were found after matching in either comparison. However, fall, fracture and rash rates were statistically significantly lower in favor of darolutamide vs apalutamide. Fall, dizziness, mental impairment, fatigue and severe fatigue rates were statistically significantly lower in favor of darolutamide vs enzalutamide.  Conclusions:   While metastasis-free survival did not differ across drugs in these cross-trial indirect comparisons, darolutamide showed a favorable safety and tolerability profile in prespecified adverse events vs apalutamide and enzalutamide.

The objective of this study was to determine if providing surgical report cards (SuReps) to surgeons resulted in improved patient outcomes.  Materials and methods:   A prospective before-and-after study was conducted at The Ottawa Hospital. A total of 422 consecutive patients undergoing radical prostatectomy were enrolled. The intervention was provision of report cards to surgeons. The control cohort was patients treated before report card feedback (pre-SuRep), and the intervention cohort was patients treated after report card feedback (post-SuRep). The primary outcomes were postoperative erectile function, urinary continence, and positive surgical margins.  Results:   Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Almost all patients (99%) were continent and the majority (59%) were potent prior to surgery. Complete 1-year followup was available for 400 patients (95%). Nerve sparing surgery increased from 70% pre-SuRep to 82% post-SuRep (p=0.01). There was a nonstatistically significant increase in the proportion of patients with a positive surgical margin post-SuRep (31% pre-SuRep vs 39% post-SuRep, p=0.08). There was no difference in postoperative erectile function (17% vs 18%, p=0.7) and a decrease in continence (75% vs 65%, p=0.02) at 1 year postoperatively.

However, these factors sometimes do not coincide within one lesion (discordant cases). In such discordant cases, the largest tumor may not be of biological significance and the secondary tumor may more greatly impact the prognosis.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent radical prostatectomy, and we identified 580 (85.3%) concordant cases and 100 (14.7%) discordant cases. The end point of this study was biochemical recurrence, and median followup was 4.2 years.  Results:   Among discordant cases in which GGs of the largest tumor and the highest GG tumor differed, the majority (67 patients) had the largest tumor of GG 2, and we set them as the study cohort. On the other hand, we regarded 212 concordant cases with an index tumor of GG 2 as the control cohort. The study cohort comprised 48 (71.6%) patients with a secondary tumor of GG 3 and 19 (28.4%) with a secondary tumor of GG 4/5. Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that the 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rates were 76%, and 67%, respectively. The 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rate of the control cohort was 91%, which was significantly better than that of the study cohort (p=0.013 and p=0.014, respectively).

Results:   We identified three patients with PC where the prostate tumor was not suspected based on the clinical-imagistic data, the correct diagnosis being the prerogative of the morphological investigation: in the first case, PC was detected during the microscopic examination of the lymph nodes (LN) in the intestinal resection specimen performed for suspected rectal cancer (RC), in the second case, in which the PC was synchronous with a RC, the dominant symptomatology was gastrointestinal, and in the third case, initially, the patient presented a widely disseminated PC, with pleural and bone metastases, as well as LN metastases, and apparent peritoneal involvement.  Conclusions:   Unusual forms of PC presentation are not as rare as expected and should be acknowledged by all those involved in diagnosing this neoplasm.

Materials and methods:   This retrospective study evaluated men who underwent targeted (fusion or in-bore) biopsy between April 2017 and January 2019 followed by prostatectomy. The primary endpoint of the study was a change in GG from biopsy to RP at a patient level. For downgrade and upgrade analysis, men with biopsy GG1 (downgrade not possible) and GG5 (upgrade not possible) were excluded, respectively. GG upgrade, downgrade, and concordance rates of each targeting approach were compared using propensity score weighting and logistic regression with inverse probability of treatment weighting. Significance level was set at .05. Index lesion GG on RP specimen served as the reference standard.  Results:   A total of 191 men (90 in the in-bore [mean age, 63 years ± 7 (standard deviation)] and 101 in the fusion biopsy group [mean age, 65 years ± 7]) were eligible and included. Fewer GG upgrades were noted in the in-bore biopsy group (14%; 12 of 85) compared with the fusion plus systematic biopsy group (30%; 28 of 93) (P = .012). The incidence of GG downgrade in the in-bore group (25%; 21 of 84) was higher than in the fusion group (17%; 16 of 93); however, the difference was not statistically significant (P = .2).

Our earlier studies have shown that ALDHhiCD44+ (DP) PCa cells and the corresponding ALDHloCD44- (DN) PCa cells manifest as PCSCs and non-PCSCs, respectively, but the underlying mechanisms regulating stemness of the PCSCs are not completely understood. To tackle this issue, we have performed RNA-Sequencing and bioinformatic analysis in DP (versus DN) cells in this study. We discovered that, PER3 (period circadian regulator 3), a circadian rhythm gene, is significantly downregulated in DP cells. Overexpression of PER3 in DP cells significantly suppressed their sphere- and colony-forming abilities as well as tumorigenicity in immunodeficient hosts. In contrast, knockdown of PER3 in DN cells dramatically promoted their colony-forming and tumor-initiating capacities. Clinically, PER3 is downregulated in human prostate cancer specimens and PER3 expression levels are highly correlated with the prognosis of the PCa patient. Mechanistically, we observed that low levels of PER3 stimulates the expression of BMAL1, leading to the phosphorylation of β-catenin and the activation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway. Together, our results indicate that PER3 negatively regulates stemness of PCSCs via WNT/β-catenin signaling in the tumor microenvironment, providing a novel strategy to treat PCa patients.""","""['Qilin Li', 'Ding Xia', 'Zhihua Wang', 'Bo Liu', 'Jing Zhang', 'Ping Peng', 'Qiujun Tang', 'Jie Dong', 'Juan Guo', 'Dong Kuang', 'Weimin Chen', 'Jing Mao', 'Qiuhui Li', 'Xin Chen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Front Cell Dev Biol""","""['Overexpression of PER3 Inhibits Self-Renewal Capability and Chemoresistance of Colorectal Cancer Stem-Like Cells via Inhibition of Notch and β-Catenin Signaling.', 'CCL5 derived from tumor-associated macrophages promotes prostate cancer stem cells and metastasis via activating β-catenin/STAT3 signaling.', 'MicroRNA-320 suppresses the stem cell-like characteristics of prostate cancer cells by downregulating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.', 'Wnt/Beta-Catenin Signaling and Prostate Cancer Therapy Resistance.', 'Interplay Between SOX9, Wnt/β-Catenin and Androgen Receptor Signaling in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'TIMELESS upregulates PD-L1 expression and exerts an immunosuppressive role in breast cancer.', 'State-of-the-art therapeutic strategies for targeting cancer stem cells in prostate cancer.', 'Major roles of the circadian clock in cancer.', 'Potential Role of the Circadian Clock in the Regulation of Cancer Stem Cells and Cancer Therapy.', 'Targeting aldehyde dehydrogenase for prostate cancer therapies.']"""

Materials and methods:   Analysis included the REQUITE PCa cohort that received external beam RT and was followed for 2 years. Late toxicity endpoints were: rectal bleeding, urinary frequency, haematuria, nocturia, decreased urinary stream. Among 43 literature-identified SNPs, the 30% most strongly associated with each toxicity were tested. SNP-SNP combinations (named SNP-allele sets) seen in ≥10% of the cohort were condensed into risk (RS) and protection (PS) scores, respectively indicating increased or decreased toxicity risk. Performance of RS and PS was evaluated by logistic regression. RS and PS were then combined into a single PRSi evaluated by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).  Results:   Among 1,387 analysed patients, toxicity rates were 11.7% (rectal bleeding), 4.0% (urinary frequency), 5.5% (haematuria), 7.8% (nocturia) and 17.1% (decreased urinary stream). RS and PS combined 8 to 15 different SNP-allele sets, depending on the toxicity endpoint. Distributions of PRSi differed significantly in patients with/without toxicity with AUCs ranging from 0.61 to 0.78. PRSi was better than the classical summed PRS, particularly for the urinary frequency, haematuria and decreased urinary stream endpoints.  Conclusions:   Our method incorporates SNP-SNP interactions when calculating PRS for radiotherapy toxicity. Our approach is better than classical summation in discriminating patients with toxicity and should enable incorporating genetic information to improve normal tissue complication probability models.""","""['Nicola Rares Franco', 'Michela Carlotta Massi', 'Francesca Ieva', 'Andrea Manzoni', 'Anna Maria Paganoni', 'Paolo Zunino', 'Liv Veldeman', 'Piet Ost', 'Valérie Fonteyne', 'Christopher J Talbot', 'Tim Rattay', 'Adam Webb', 'Kerstie Johnson', 'Maarten Lambrecht', 'Karin Haustermans', 'Gert De Meerleer', 'Dirk de Ruysscher', 'Ben Vanneste', 'Evert Van Limbergen', 'Ananya Choudhury', 'Rebecca M Elliott', 'Elena Sperk', 'Marlon R Veldwijk', 'Carsten Herskind', 'Barbara Avuzzi', 'Barbara Noris Chiorda', 'Riccardo Valdagni', 'David Azria', 'Marie-Pierre Farcy-Jacquet', 'Muriel Brengues', 'Barry S Rosenstein', 'Richard G Stock', 'Ana Vega', 'Miguel E Aguado-Barrera', 'Paloma Sosa-Fajardo', 'Alison M Dunning', 'Laura Fachal', 'Sarah L Kerns', 'Debbie Payne', 'Jenny Chang-Claude', 'Petra Seibold', 'Catharine M L West', 'Tiziana Rancati;REQUITE Consortium Collaborators']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['A Deep Learning Approach Validates Genetic Risk Factors for Late Toxicity After Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy in a REQUITE Multi-National Cohort.', 'No Association Between Polygenic Risk Scores for Cancer and Development of Radiation Therapy Toxicity.', 'Meta-analysis of Genome Wide Association Studies Identifies Genetic Markers of Late Toxicity Following Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Multivariate normal tissue complication probability modeling of gastrointestinal toxicity after external beam radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Functional outcomes and complications following radiation therapy for prostate cancer: a critical analysis of the literature.', 'Learning high-order interactions for polygenic risk prediction.', 'The Normal, the Radiosensitive, and the Ataxic in the Era of Precision Radiotherapy: A Narrative Review.', 'Polygenic Risk Scores Associated with Tumor Immune Infiltration in Common Cancers.']"""

Our results showed that newly-insured FB adults substantially increased their use of all primary care checks, and exercise and diet advice. We also found improvements in use of endoscopies, two modalities of colon cancer screening, and prostate cancer screening, but not in receipt of mammography and clinical breast exams. Newly-insured FB PS use remained lower than use among continuously-insured USB adults, but some of the differences were explained by adjustment to enabling and health needs factors.

A dose-dependent decrease in viable cells was seen for A375 melanoma, MCF-7 breast cancer, and PC-3 prostate cancer cells cultured in 1-5 µm cystatin C after 24 h. Real-time assessment of growth rates in A375 cell cultures for 48 h by digital holographic microscopy showed an increased doubling time for cells cultured in the presence of 5 µm cystatin C (20.1 h) compared with control cells (14.7 h). A prolonged doubling time was already observed during the first 12 h, indicating a rapid general decrease in cell proliferation at the population level. Tracking of individual cells in phase holographic images showed that dividing cells incubated with 5 µm cystatin C underwent fewer mitoses during 48 h than control cells. In addition, the time between cell divisions was longer, especially for the first cell cycle. Incubation with the variant W106F-cystatin C (with high cellular uptake rate) resulted in a lower number of viable cells and a prolonged doubling time than when cells were incubated with wild-type cystatin C, but no effect was observed for (R24A,R25A)-cystatin C (low cellular uptake).

LOY is the most common acquired mutation and is associated with aberrant clonal expansion of cells, yet it remains unclear whether this mosaicism exerts a direct physiological effect. We studied DNA and RNA from leukocytes in sorted- and single-cells in vivo and in vitro. DNA analyses of sorted cells showed that men diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease was primarily affected with LOY in NK cells whereas prostate cancer patients more frequently displayed LOY in CD4 + T cells and granulocytes. Moreover, bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing in leukocytes allowed scoring of LOY from mRNA data and confirmed considerable variation in the rate of LOY across individuals and cell types. LOY-associated transcriptional effect (LATE) was observed in ~ 500 autosomal genes showing dysregulation in leukocytes with LOY. The fraction of LATE genes within specific cell types was substantially larger than the fraction of LATE genes shared between different subsets of leukocytes, suggesting that LOY might have pleiotropic effects. LATE genes are involved in immune functions but also encode proteins with roles in other diverse biological processes.

New technologies such as the da Vinci robotic system and three-dimensional (3D) laparoscopic imaging system have been developed to overcome the challenges of conventional laparoscopy. This study aimed to compare the perioperative, oncological, and functional outcomes of robot-assisted laparoscopic RP (RALP) and 3D laparoscopic RP (3D LRP). Materials and Methods: The study was approved by the local ethics committee and included 65 patients (38 RALP, 27 3D LRP) who underwent RP with the diagnosis of localized prostate cancer between May 2019 and January 2020. All demographic, clinical, perioperative, pathological, and postoperative variables were recorded. Results: There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of preoperative patient characteristics. The mean operative times of the RALP and 3D LRP groups were 135.74 ± 11.51 and 165.37 ± 15.86 minutes, respectively, with a statistically significant difference between the two groups (P = .001). The mean estimated blood loss was 237 ± 71 mL in the RALP group and 257 ± 54 mL in the 3D LRP group, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups (P = .236). In the 6 months of follow-up, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of biochemical recurrence, continence, and potency.

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed a single-center cohort of men treated with salvage high-intensity focused ultrasound for locally recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy and adjuvant or salvage radiotherapy. All patients had a combination of choline positron emission tomography, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, and transrectal biopsies to confirm the local recurrence. Treatment failure was defined as persistent or recurrent prostate cancer in the prostatic bed and/or metastasis and/or introduction of systemic treatment. Progression was defined as metastasis and/or introduction of systemic treatment. Complications (Clavien-Dindo classification) and continence (Ingelman-Sundberg score) were evaluated. Kaplan-Meier analysis estimated oncological outcomes.  Results:   Between July 2009 and November 2018, 22 patients were included; the median followup was 2.32 years. At 3 years, treatment failure-free survival rate was estimated to be 49.7% and progression-free survival rate 60.4%. Prostate specific antigen nadir ≤0.2 ng/ml was reached in 50% of the patients. A nadir of ≤0.2 ng/ml was significantly associated with better treatment failure-free and progression-free survival probabilities (p=0.003 and p=0.037, respectively).

However, its impact on treatment choice in high-risk populations of African Americans is largely unknown and, in general, the effect of the GPS on this difficult decision has not been evaluated in randomized trials.  Methods:   Two hundred men with National Comprehensive Cancer Network very low to low-intermediate PCa from three Chicago hospitals (70% Black, 16% college graduates) were randomly assigned at diagnosis to standard counseling with or without a 12-gene GPS assay. The primary end point was treatment choice at a second postdiagnosis visit. The proportion of patients choosing AS was compared, and multivariable modeling was used to estimate the effects of various factors on AS acceptance.  Results:   AS acceptance was high overall, although marginally lower in the intervention group (77% v 88%; P = .067), and lower still when men with inadequate specimens were excluded (P = .029). Men with lower health literacy who received a GPS were seven-fold less likely to choose AS compared with controls, whereas no difference was seen in men with higher health literacy (Pinteraction = .022). Among men with low-intermediate risk, 69% had GPS values consistent with unfavorable intermediate or high-risk cancer. AS choice was also independently associated with a family history of PCa and having health insurance.  Conclusion:   In contrast to other studies, the net effect of the GPS was to move patients away from AS, primarily among men with low health literacy.

In the clinic, DLL3-targeted 89Zr-immunoPET has the potential to aid in the assessment of disease burden and facilitate the selection of patients suitable for therapies that target the antigen. The overwhelming majority of 89Zr-labeled radioimmunoconjugates are synthesized via the random conjugation of desferrioxamine (DFO) to lysine residues within the immunoglobulin. While this approach is admittedly facile, it can produce heterogeneous constructs with suboptimal in vitro and in vivo behavior. In an effort to circumvent these issues, we report the development and preclinical evaluation of site-specifically labeled radioimmunoconjugates for DLL3-targeted immunoPET. To this end, we modified a cysteine-engineered variant of the DLL3-targeting antibody SC16-MB1 with two thiol-reactive variants of DFO: one bearing a maleimide moiety (Mal-DFO) and the other containing a phenyloxadiazolyl methyl sulfone group (PODS-DFO). In an effort to obtain immunoconjugates with a DFO-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 2, we explored both the reduction of the antibody with tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) as well as the use of a combination of glutathione and arginine as reducing and stabilizing agents, respectively. While exerting control over the DAR of the immunoconjugate proved cumbersome using TCEP, the use of glutathione and arginine enabled the selective reduction of the engineered cysteines and thus the formation of homogeneous immunoconjugates. A head-to-head comparison of the resulting 89Zr-radioimmunoconjugates in mice bearing DLL3-expressing H82 xenografts revealed no significant differences in tumoral uptake and showed comparable radioactivity concentrations in most healthy nontarget organs. However, 89Zr-DFOPODS-DAR2SC16-MB1 produced 30% lower uptake (3.3 ± 0.5 %ID/g) in the kidneys compared to 89Zr-DFOMal-DAR2SC16-MB1 (4.7 ± 0.5 %ID/g). In addition, H82-bearing mice injected with a 89Zr-labeled isotype-control radioimmunoconjugate synthesized using PODS exhibited ∼40% lower radioactivity in the kidneys compared to mice administered its maleimide-based counterpart. Taken together, these results demonstrate the improved in vivo performance of the PODS-based radioimmunoconjugate and suggest that a stable, well-defined DAR2 radiopharmaceutical may be suitable for the clinical immunoPET of DLL3-expressing cancers.""","""['Sai Kiran Sharma', 'Pierre Adumeau', 'Outi Keinänen', 'Vikram Sisodiya', 'Hetal Sarvaiya', 'Robert Tchelepi', 'Joshua A Korsen', 'Jacob Pourat', 'Kimberly J Edwards', 'Ashwin Ragupathi', 'Omar Hamdy', 'Laura R Saunders', 'Charles M Rudin', 'John T Poirier', 'Jason S Lewis', 'Brian M Zeglis']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Bioconjug Chem""","""['Lysine-Directed Site-Selective Bioconjugation for the Creation of Radioimmunoconjugates.', 'The Influence of Glycans-Specific Bioconjugation on the FcγRI Binding and In vivo Performance of 89Zr-DFO-Pertuzumab.', 'Visualizing Galectin-3 Binding Protein Expression with ImmunoPET.', '89Zr-Immuno-Positron Emission Tomography in Oncology: State-of-the-Art 89Zr Radiochemistry.', 'Delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3): an attractive actionable target in tumors with neuroendocrine origin.', 'Site-Specific Radiohalogenation of a HER2-Targeted Single-Domain Antibody Fragment Using a Novel Residualizing Prosthetic Agent.']"""

Therefore, the primary goal of this work was to deepen knowledge on the mechanism of its photoactivated antitumor action so that this information could be used to propose a new class of compounds as drug candidates for curing very hardly treatable human tumors, such as androgen resistant prostatic tumors of metastatic origin. Conventional anticancer chemotherapies exhibit several disadvantages, such as limited efficiency to target cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are considered the main reason for chemotherapy resistance, relapse, and metastasis. Herein, we show, using DU145 tumor cells, taken as the model of hormone-refractory and aggressive prostate cancer cells resistant to conventional antineoplastic drugs, that the photoactivated conjugate 3 very efficiently eliminates both prostate bulk (differentiated) and prostate hardly treatable CSCs simultaneously and with a similar efficiency. Notably, the very low toxicity of IrIII -COUPY conjugate in the prostate DU145 cells in the dark and its pronounced selectivity for tumor cells compared with noncancerous cells could result in low side effects and reduced damage of healthy cells during the photoactivated therapy by this agent. Moreover, the experiments performed with the 3D spheroids formed from DU145 CSCs showed that conjugate 3 can penetrate the inner layers of tumor spheres, which might markedly increase its therapeutic effect. Also interestingly, this conjugate induces apoptotic cell death in prostate cancer DU145 cells associated with calcium signaling flux in these cells and autophagy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that a photoactivatable metal-based compound is an efficient agent capable of killing even hardly treatable CSCs.""","""['Vojtech Novohradsky', 'Lenka Markova', 'Hana Kostrhunova', 'Jana Kasparkova', 'José Ruiz', 'Vicente Marchán', 'Viktor Brabec']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Chemistry""","""['Towards Novel Photodynamic Anticancer Agents Generating Superoxide Anion Radicals: A Cyclometalated IrIII Complex Conjugated to a Far-Red Emitting Coumarin.', 'Dipyridophenazine iridium(III) complex as a phototoxic cancer stem cell selective, mitochondria targeting agent.', 'HPMA copolymer-based combination therapy toxic to both prostate cancer stem/progenitor cells and differentiated cells induces durable anti-tumor effects.', 'Metformin and prostate cancer stem cells: a novel therapeutic target.', 'Taxane-based Combination Therapies for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'A near-infrared light-activatable Ru(ii)-coumarin photosensitizer active under hypoxic conditions.', ""Let's Go 3D!

The follow up time varied from 19 to 81 months, with a median of 45 months and a mean of 47 months. The uniformity of the treatment technique for both periods is investigated. Tumour Control Probability (TCP) values for the expected local control are calculated according to a population phenomenological TCP model for different values of the α/β ratio. The calculations are based on the obtained averaged Dose Volume Histograms for the two investigated sub-periods. 74 patients were treated in total. Local control failure is observed in 5 cases, which corresponds to an observed TCP = 93.2%. The comparison of the calculated population average DVH with the DVHs of the cases with local control failure shows that in 4 of them, doses higher than average were delivered to the prostate. It is shown that the uniformity of the treatment was improved during the second sub-period. A possible explanation of the observed failures may be that these cases exhibit inherent tumour cell radio-resistance higher than average.

Despite the interest in exercise as a treatment strategy to address masculinity concerns, there is insufficient information about how perceptions may differ in active and inactive men. The aim of this study was to explore how exercise might influence self-perceptions of masculinity in men across the exercise continuum (from active to inactive) and in men receiving different forms of treatment for their prostate cancer, including androgen deprivation therapy.  Methods:   Individual, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 men. Ten men met aerobic and/or resistance guidelines and were considered active, while five men, considered inactive, reached neither guideline. This study used a grounded theory approach to data analysis, examining masculinity issues in active men and compared them to inactive men.  Results:   Redefining masculinity emerged as an overarching theme. Subthemes were the various coping strategies men used to redefining masculinity and directly related to their exercise habits. Coping subthemes included re-establishing control, tapping into competition, remaining socially connected, rationalization, and acceptance.

This preferential migration/growth in the spine is not fully understood. Dura has been shown to affect the surrounding microenvironment and promote cancer growth. Here, we investigate the role of dural cytokines in promoting the metastatic potential of prostate cancer (PCa) and the involvement of the CXCR2 signaling pathway.  Methods:   The role of dural conditioned media (DCM) in proliferation, migration and invasion of five PCa cell lines with various hormone sensitivities was assessed in the presence or absence of the CXCR2 inhibitor, SB225002. CXCR2 surface protein was examined by FACS. Cytokine levels were measured using a mouse cytokine array.  Results:   We observed high levels of cytokines produced by dura and within the vertebral body bone marrow, namely CXCL1 and CXCL2, that act on the CXCR2 receptor. All prostate cell lines treated with DCM demonstrated significant increase in growth, migration and invasion regardless of androgen sensitivity, except PC3, which did not significantly increase in invasiveness. When treated with SB225002, the growth response to DCM by cells expressing the highest levels of CXCR2 as measured by FACS (LNCaP and 22Rv1) was blunted. The increase in migration was significantly decreased in all lines in the presence of SB225002. Interestingly, the invasion increase seen with DCM was unchanged when these cells were treated with the CXCR2 inhibitor, except PC3 did demonstrate a significant decrease in invasion.  Conclusion:   DCM enhances the metastatic potential of PCa with increased proliferation, migration and invasion. This phenomenon is partly mediated through the CXCR2 pathway.""","""['Michael J Strong', 'Sabrina Rocco', 'Russell Taichman', 'Gregory A Clines', 'Nicholas J Szerlip']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Neurooncol""","""['GRO-α and IL-8 enhance ovarian cancer metastatic potential via the CXCR2-mediated TAK1/NFκB signaling cascade.', 'Dural Cells Release Factors Which Promote Cancer Cell Malignancy and Induce Immunosuppressive Markers in Bone Marrow Myeloid Cells.', 'Marrow adipocyte-derived CXCL1 and CXCL2 contribute to osteolysis in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Programmed Cell Death 10 Mediated CXCL2-CXCR2 Signaling in Regulating Tumor-Associated Microglia/Macrophages Recruitment in Glioblastoma.', 'SB225002 inhibits prostate cancer invasion and attenuates the expression of BSP, OPN and MMP‑2.', 'Bone metastasis from glioblastoma: a systematic review.', 'Differential immune landscapes in appendicular versus axial skeleton.']"""

Methods and materials:   Between October 2019 and April 2020, twenty consecutive castration sensitive oligorecurrent prostate cancer patients were enrolled in an ethical committee approved prospective observational study (Protocol n. XXXX) and treated with PSMA-PET/CT guided SBRT by means of 1.5 T MRI-Linac (Unity, Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden). The mean delivered dose was 35 Gy in 5 fractions. Clinicians reported toxicity was prospectively collected according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0. Quality of life (QoL) assessment was performed using EORTC-QLQ C30 questionnaires administered at baseline, end of treatment and at first follow-up.  Results:   Twenty-five lesions in 20 castration sensitive oligorecurrent patients were treated: the most commonly treated anatomic sites were nodal (n = 16) and pelvic bone (n = 9). Median PSA-value preMRI guided SBRT was 1.16 ng/mL (range, 0.27-8.9), whereas median PSA value at first follow-up after SBRT was 0.44 ng/mL (range, 0.06-8.15). At first follow-up, for 16 patients showing detectable PSA, PSMA-PET/CT was performed detecting, respectively, in 6 cases partial response and in 10 cases complete response. In the remaining cases, PSA-value was undetectable after SBRT. Radiotherapy treatment was safe and well tolerated according to the PROMs. No acute G2 or higher toxicities were recorded.

The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database was queried to examine the effect of obesity, defined as BMI >30, on outcomes after Minimally Invasive Radical Retropubic Prostatectomy (MI-RRP).  Materials and methods:   Utilizing the NSQIP database, patient records were identified using the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code 55866 (laparoscopy, surgical prostatectomy, radical retropubic) during a 10-year period (2007-2017). Obesity was classified according to the CDC classification. Chi-square tests were utilized to evaluate BMI distribution by surgery year. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship of BMI with length of stay (LOS) and hospital readmission within 30 days, after controlling for preoperative variables.  Results:   Records of 49,238 patients who have undergone MI-RRP during 2007-2017 were evaluated. Mean yearly BMI rose from 28.5 to 29.2, while the percentage of surgical patients with BMI >30 rose by 5% (33% to 38%; p<0.0001) over the study period. Obese patients demonstrated higher morbidity, prolonged LOS, and increased readmission rates after MI-RRP. Obesity severity correlated negatively with quality indicators in a graded fashion.  Conclusions:   Obesity rates in patients undergoing MI-RRP increased from 2007-2017. Obese patients are at increased risk of morbidity, prolonged LOS, and readmission within 30 days, following MI-RRP. These patients should not be excluded from MI-RRP; rather, physicians should discuss these increased risks with their patients.

Results:   Among 73,280 men with PCa, only 27.7% met the criteria for screening. In contrast with the continuous increase in the screening population from 334 men in 2008 to 5,049 men in 2016, the non-screening population remained low at 1,543 men in 2008 and 1,819 men in 2016 (p<0.001).

These decisions are inherently uncertain because health gains in trials may not translate to practice owing to differences in the population, treatment use and setting. Post-market analysis of real-world data can provide additional evidence but estimates from standard matching methods may be biased when unobserved characteristics explain whether a patient is treated and their outcomes. We propose a new untreated matching approach that can reduce this bias. Our approach utilises the outcomes of contemporaneous untreated patients to improve the matching of treated and historical control patients. We assess the performance of this new approach compared to standard matching using a simulation study and demonstrate the steps required using a funding decision for prostate cancer treatments in Australia. Our simulation study shows that our new matching approach eliminates nearly all bias when unobserved treatment selection is related to outcomes, and outperforms standard matching in most scenarios. In our empirical example, standard matching overestimated survival by 15% (95% confidence interval 2-34) compared to our untreated matching approach. The health gains estimated using our approach were slightly lower than expected based on the trial evidence, but we also found evidence that in practice prescribers ceased prior therapies earlier, treated a more vulnerable population and continued treatment for longer. Our untreated matching approach offers researchers a new tool for reducing uncertainty in healthcare funding decisions using real-world data.""","""['Peter Ghijben', 'Dennis Petrie', 'Silva Zavarsek', 'Gang Chen', 'Emily Lancsar']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Pharmacoeconomics""","""['Sutureless Aortic Valve Replacement for Treatment of Severe Aortic Stenosis: A Single Technology Assessment of Perceval Sutureless Aortic Valve Internet.', 'Ethical pitfalls in neonatal comparative effectiveness trials.', 'The future of Cochrane Neonatal.', 'Telephone interventions for symptom management in adults with cancer.', 'Interprofessional collaboration to improve professional practice and healthcare outcomes.']"""

MRI improves biopsy accuracy and could therewith affect inclusion in or continuation of AS. We aim to assess the effect of MRI with target biopsies on the total rate of patients discontinuing AS, and in particular discontinuation due to Grade Group (GG) reclassification.  Methods:   Three subpopulations included in the prospective PRIAS study with GG 1 were studied. Group A consists of patients diagnosed before 2009 without MRI before or during AS. Group B consists of patients diagnosed without MRI, but all patients underwent MRI within 6 months after diagnosis. Group C consists of patients who underwent MRI before diagnosis and during follow-up. We used cumulative incidence curves to estimate the rates of discontinuation.  Results:   In Group A (n = 500), the cumulative probability of discontinuing AS at 2 years is 27.5%; GG reclassification solely accounted for 6.9% of the discontinuation. In Group B (n = 351) these numbers are 30.9 and 22.8%, and for Group C (n = 435) 24.2 and 13.4%. The three groups were not randomized, however, baseline characteristics are highly comparable.  Conclusions:   Performing an MRI before starting AS reduces the cumulative probability of discontinuing AS at 2 years. Performing an MRI after already being on AS increases the cumulative probability of discontinuing AS in comparison to not performing an MRI, especially because of an increase in GG reclassification. These results suggest that the use of MRI could lead to more patients being considered unsuitable for AS. Considering the excellent long-term cancer-specific survival of AS before the MRI era, the increased diagnostic accuracy of MRI could potentially lead to more overtreatment if definitions and treatment options of significant PCa are not adapted.""","""['H B Luiting', 'S Remmers', 'R Valdagni', 'E R Boevé', 'F Staerman', 'J Rueb', 'D M Somford', 'T Pickles', 'A Rannikko', 'M J Roobol;PRIAS consortium']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Value of Serial Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging-guided Biopsies in Men with Low-risk Prostate Cancer on Active Surveillance After 1 Yr Follow-up.', 'A Decade of Active Surveillance in the PRIAS Study: An Update and Evaluation of the Criteria Used to Recommend a Switch to Active Treatment.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging facilitates reclassification during active surveillance for prostate cancer.', 'Low-risk Prostate Cancer: Identification, Management, and Outcomes.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging-guided Active Surveillance of Prostate Cancer: Time to Say Goodbye to Protocol-based Biopsies.']"""

Shear wave elasticity imaging (SWEI) is an elasticity imaging technique that has been commercially implemented and is sensitive and specific for PCa. We have developed a SWEI system capable of 3-D data acquisition using a dense acoustic radiation force (ARF) push approach that leads to enhanced shear wave signal-to-noise ratio compared with that of the commercially available SWEI systems and facilitates screening of the entire gland before biopsy. Additionally, we imaged and assessed 36 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy using 3-D SWEI and determined a shear wave speed threshold separating PCa from healthy prostate tissue with sensitivities and specificities akin to those for multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging fusion biopsy. The approach measured the mean shear wave speed in each prostate region to be 4.8 m/s (Young's modulus E = 69.1 kPa) in the peripheral zone, 5.3 m/s (E = 84.3 kPa) in the central gland and 6.0 m/s (E = 108.0 kPa) for PCa with statistically significant (p < 0.0001) differences among all regions. Three-dimensional SWEI receiver operating characteristic analyses identified a threshold of 5.6 m/s (E = 94.1 kPa) to separate PCa from healthy tissue with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and area under the curve (AUC) of 81%, 82%, 69%, 89% and 0.84, respectively. Additionally, a shear wave speed ratio was assessed to normalize for tissue compression and patient variability, which yielded a threshold of 1.11 to separate PCa from healthy prostate tissue and was accompanied by a substantial increase in specificity, PPV and AUC, where the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and AUC were 75%, 90%, 79%, 88% and 0.90, respectively.

The patient underwent a standard left orchifunicolectomy in April 2019 without intra- or perioperative complications. The pathological analysis showed a testicular metastasis of acinar adenocarcinoma.  Conclusions:   In conclusion, testicular metastasis from PCa are uncommon conditions. PSA evaluation and physical examination of all sites of metastasis and accurate evaluation of all signs/symptoms during the clinical visit remains crucial to the diagnosis of recurrence.""","""['Salvatore Smelzo', 'Guglielmo Mantica', 'Roberta Lucianò', 'Nazario Pio Tenace', 'Davide De Marchi', 'Giovannalberto Pini', 'Giovanni Passaretti', 'Andrea Losa', 'Franco Gaboardi']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Urologia""","""['Isolated Testicular Metastasis of Prostate Cancer after Radical Prostatectomy: Case Report and Literature Review.', 'Unilateral testicular metastasis of low PSA level prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Isolated Testicular Metastasis from Prostate Cancer.', 'Solitary testicular metastasis from prostate cancer: a rare case of isolated recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Prostatic metastases from testicular nonseminomatous germ cell cancer: two case reports and a review of the literature.', 'Histologically Confirmed Testicular Metastasis Revealed by 89ZrZr-PSMA-617 PET/CT in a Patient with Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer and Negative Conventional PSMA PET/CT Imaging.', 'A young patient with prostatic carcinoma with testicular metastasis.']"""

However, little is known about the extent to which the patient's self-decisions influenced the prognostic period. This study focused on the patient's self-decision and investigated the impact of the self-decision to stop cancer treatment on their post-cancer treatment survival period and place of death.We retrospectively analyzed 167 cases of advanced genitourinary cancer patients (kidney cancer: 42; bladder cancer: 68; prostate cancer: 57) treated at the University of Fukui Hospital (UFH), who later died because of cancer. Of these, 100 patients decided to stop cancer treatment by themselves (self-decision group), while the families of the remaining 67 patients (family's decision group) decided to stop treatment on their behalf because the patient's decision-making ability was already impaired. Differences in the post-cancer-treatment survival period and place of death between the 2 groups were examined. The association between place of death and survival period was also analyzed.The median survival period after terminating cancer treatment was approximately 6 times longer in the self-decision group (145.5 days in self-decision group vs 23.0 days in family's decision group, P < .001). Proportions for places of death were as follows: among the self-decision group, 42.0% of patients died at UFH, 45.0% at other medical institutions, and 13.0% at home; among the family's decision group, 62.7% died at UFH, 32.8% at other medical institutions, and 4.5% at home. The proportion of patients who died at UFH was significantly higher among the family's decision group (P = .011). The median survival period was significantly shorter for patients who died at UFH (UFH: 30.0 days; other institutions/home: 161.0 days; P < .001).Significantly longer post-cancer-treatment survival period and higher home death rate were observed among patients whose cancer treatment was terminated based on their self-decision. Our results provide clinical evidence, especially in terms of prognostic period and place of death that support the importance of discussing bad news, such as stopping cancer treatment with patients.""","""['Hisato Kobayashi', 'Katsuki Tsuchiyama', 'Minekatsu Taga', 'Takahiro Tokunaga', 'Hideaki Ito', 'Osamu Yokoyama']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Impact on place of death in cancer patients: a causal exploration in southern Switzerland.', 'Characteristics of Palliative Patients, Insights of Patients and Families, and the Impact of Estimated Survival Time on Therapy Decisions.', 'Retrospective Prognostic Study of Death at Home or Hospice Versus at a Hospital Among Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Breaking the ""bad"" news to patients and families: preparing to have the conversation about end-of-life and hospice care.', 'Genitourinary cancer in the elderly.']"""

However, conventional FCN is typically trained by the cross-entropy or Dice loss, which only calculates the error between predictions and ground-truth labels for pixels individually. This often results in non-smooth neighborhoods in the predicted segmentation. This problem becomes more serious in CT prostate segmentation as CT images are usually of low tissue contrast. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage framework, with the first stage to quickly localize the prostate region, and the second stage to precisely segment the prostate by a multi-task UNet architecture. We introduce a novel online metric learning module through voxel-wise sampling in the multi-task network. Therefore, the proposed network has a dual-branch architecture that tackles two tasks: (1) a segmentation sub-network aiming to generate the prostate segmentation, and (2) a voxel-metric learning sub-network aiming to improve the quality of the learned feature space supervised by a metric loss. Specifically, the voxel-metric learning sub-network samples tuples (including triplets and pairs) in voxel-level through the intermediate feature maps. Unlike conventional deep metric learning methods that generate triplets or pairs in image-level before the training phase, our proposed voxel-wise tuples are sampled in an online manner and operated in an end-to-end fashion via multi-task learning. To evaluate the proposed method, we implement extensive experiments on a real CT image dataset consisting 339 patients. The ablation studies show that our method can effectively learn more representative voxel-level features compared with the conventional learning methods with cross-entropy or Dice loss. And the comparisons show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a reasonable margin.""","""['Kelei He', 'Chunfeng Lian', 'Ehsan Adeli', 'Jing Huo', 'Yang Gao', 'Bing Zhang', 'Junfeng Zhang', 'Dinggang Shen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Image Anal""","""['HF-UNet: Learning Hierarchically Inter-Task Relevance in Multi-Task U-Net for Accurate Prostate Segmentation in CT Images.', 'Vessel segmentation from volumetric images: a multi-scale double-pathway network with class-balanced loss at the voxel level.', 'Convolutional neural network for automated mass segmentation in mammography.', 'Deep learning of the sectional appearances of 3D CT images for anatomical structure segmentation based on an FCN voting method.', 'Review of Semantic Segmentation of Medical Images Using Modified Architectures of UNET.', ""Technology for Position Correction of Satellite Precipitation and Contributions to Error Reduction-A Case of the '720' Rainstorm in Henan, China."", ""BMNet: A New Region-Based Metric Learning Method for Early Alzheimer's Disease Identification With FDG-PET Images."", 'Deep Learning for Automated Analysis of Cellular and Extracellular Components of the Foreign Body Response in Multiphoton Microscopy Images.']"""

This study aims to explore the potential role of Pmepa1 in pan-cancer and specific cancer, with a view to deepening the research on the pathological mechanism of cancer.  Main methods:   The Perl language and R language were used to identify the correlation between PMEPA1 expression level and clinical indicators, prognosis values, tumor microenvironment, immune cells' infiltration, immune checkpoint genes, TMB and MSI. The Therapeutic Target Database was used for identifying potential therapeutic drugs that target the pathways that are significantly affected by PMEPA1 expression.  Key findings:   PMEPA1 differential expression significantly correlated with patients' age, race, tumors' stage and status. PMEPA1 high expression was closely correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types, excluding prostate adenocarcinoma. PMEPA1 expression was closely related to tumor cells and the immune microenvironment in stromal and immune cells' level, immune cells' infiltration, immune checkpoint genes, tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability. We also found that the activity of the olfactory transduction pathway was closely related to PMEPA1 expression. In pan-cancer, Trifluoperazine and Halofantrine have the potential to reduce PMEPA1 expression.

Both univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed to screen for differential metabolites between PCa and BPH, followed by the selection of potential biomarkers through machine learning. The chosen candidate biomarkers were then verified by targeted analysis and transcriptome data. The results showed that twelve metabolites were significantly dysregulated between PCa and BPH, three metabolites including L-serine, myo-inositol, and decanoic acid could be potential biomarkers for discriminating PCa from BPH. Most importantly, ROC curve analysis demonstrated that the involvement of the three potential biomarkers has increased the area under the curve (AUC) value of cPSA and tPSA from 0.542 and 0.592 to 0.781, respectively.

Methods:   We used a 20% national sample of Medicare claims to identify men diagnosed with prostate cancer from 2010 through 2016 initiating surveillance (N = 13,048). Patients were assigned to the physician responsible for the bulk of surveillance care based on billing patterns. Freedom from treatment was assessed by specialty of the responsible physician (urology, radiation oncology, medical oncology, and primary care). Multinomial logistic regression models were used to examine associations between specialty and treatment patterns.  Results:   Urologists were responsible for surveillance in 93.7% of patients in 2010 and 96.2% of patients in 2016 (P for trend = .01). Testing patterns varied by specialty. For example, patients of medical oncologists had more frequent prostate-specific antigen testing compared with patients of urologists (1.85 v 2.39 tests per year, respectively; P < .01). Three years after diagnosis, a significantly smaller proportion of patients managed by radiation oncologists (64.3%) remained on surveillance compared with patients managed by other physicians (75.8%-79.5%; P < .01). Although radiation was the most common treatment among all men who transitioned to treatment, a disproportionate percentage of patients followed by radiation oncologists (28.9%) ultimately underwent radiation compared with patients followed by other physicians (15.1%-15.4%; P < .01).  Conclusion:   Nontrivial percentages of patients on active surveillance are managed by physicians outside of urology.

Results:   The median follow-up time for the discovery and replication cohorts was 7.6 and 6.5 years, respectively. Highly significant correlations between urinary oestrogens were observed; however, correlations with circulating oestrogens were modest.

Likewise, CASP8 mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in prostate cancer when compared to benign prostate tissues in four independent clinical datasets. In addition, mRNA levels of CASP8 were higher in patients with recurrent prostate cancer when compared to patients with non-recurrent prostate cancer and high expression of CASP8 was associated with worse disease-free survival and overall survival in renal cancer.

Methylated genes have been found in breast cancer (BC) and beneficial biomarkers for early diagnosis. Prognostic assessment of breast cancer remain little known. Zinc finger protein 132 (ZNF132) is downregulated by promoter methylation in prostate cancer and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. However, no study provides information on the status of ZNF132, analyzes diagnosis and prognostic significance of ZNF132 in BC.  Methods:   In the present study, the expression of ZNF132 mRNA and protein level was determined based on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA-Seq database and clinical samples analysis and multiple cancer cell lines verification. P rognostic significance of ZNF132 in BC was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier plotter. Molecular mechanisms exploration of ZNF132 in BC was performed using the multiple bioinformatic tools. Hypermethylated status of ZNF132 in BC cell lines was confirmed via Methylation specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) analysis.  Results:   The expression of ZNF132 both the mRNA and protein levels was downregulated in BC tissues. These results were obtained based on TCGA database and clinical sample analysis. Survival analysis from the Kaplan-Meier plotter revealed that the lower level of ZNF132 was associated with a shorter Relapse Free Survival (RFS) time. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of 0.887 confirmed ZNF132 had powerful sensitivity and specificity to distinguish between BC and adjacent normal tissues. Bioinformatic analysis showed that 6% ((58/960)) alterations of ZNF132 were identified from cBioPortal. ZNF132 participated in multiple biological pathways based on the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) database including the regulation of cell cycle and glycolysis. Finally, MSP analysis demonstrated that ZNF132 was hypermethylated in a panel of breast cancer cell lines and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) treatment restored ZNF132 expression in partial cell lines.  Conclusions:   Results revealed that hypermethylation of ZNF132 contributed to its downregulated expression and could be identified as a new diagnostic and prognostic marker in BC.""","""['Zhao Liu#', 'Jiaxin Liu#', 'Ruimiao Liu', 'Man Xue', 'Weifan Zhang', 'Xinhui Zhao', 'Jiang Zhu', 'Peng Xia']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Downregulation of zinc finger protein 132 in prostate cancer is associated with aberrant promoter hypermethylation and poor prognosis.', 'Epigenetic silencing of ZNF132 mediated by methylation-sensitive Sp1 binding promotes cancer progression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Zinc finger protein 382 is downregulated by promoter hypermethylation in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia patients.', 'MGP is downregulated due to promoter methylation in chemoresistant ER+ breast cancer and high MGP expression predicts better survival outcomes.', 'Simultaneous CXCL12 and ESR1 CpG island hypermethylation correlates with poor prognosis in sporadic breast cancer.', 'Kruppel-family zinc finger proteins as emerging epigenetic biomarkers in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'HIV, asymptomatic STI, and the rectal mucosal immune environment among young men who have sex with men.', 'GASP1 enhances malignant phenotypes of breast cancer cells and decreases their response to paclitaxel by forming a vicious cycle with IGF1/IGF1R signaling pathway.', 'Elevated Ras related GTP binding B (RRAGB) expression predicts poor overall survival and constructs a prognostic nomogram for colon adenocarcinoma.', 'Sensitive detection of colorectal cancer in peripheral blood by a novel methylation assay.']"""

However, the role of exercise in modulating prostate cancer behavior has yet to be established.  Methods:   Prostate tumors were induced in C57BL/6 male mice (n = 28) by subcutaneous inoculation of a suspension of murine androgen-independent RM1 cells (1.5 × 105 cells/500 μL phosphate-buffered saline) in the dorsal region. Mice were randomly allocated into 2 study groups: sedentary tumor-induced (n = 14) and exercised tumor-induced (n = 14). Exercise consisted of voluntary running in wheeled cages. Mice (n = 7 per group) were sacrificed either 14 or 28 days after cell inoculation to evaluate tumor weight and percentage of area occupied by immunohistochemistry stained cells for Ki-67 and TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling, used as surrogate markers of cell proliferation and apoptosis, respectively.  Results:   Compared with sedentary tumor-induced mice, the tumors developed by exercised tumor-induced mice were significantly smaller at 14 days (0.17 [0.12] g vs 0.48 [0.24] g, P < .05) and at 28 days (0.92 [0.73] g vs 2.09 [1.31] g, P < .05), with smaller Ki-67 and greater TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling stained areas (P < .05).

Methods and materials:   Patients were eligible with biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate, a calculated lymph node risk of at least 25%, Karnofsky performance scale ≥70, and no evidence of M1 disease. Acute and late toxicity were prospectively collected at each follow-up using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0). The pelvic lymph nodes were treated to a dose of 56 Gy over 28 fractions with a simultaneous integrated boost to the prostate to a total dose of 70 Gy over 28 fractions using intensity-modulated radiation therapy.  Results:   Thirty patients were prospectively enrolled from October 2010 to August 2014.

Both TBECH and DPTE alter gene expression associated with AR regulation. However, it remains to be determined if TBECH and DPTE can affect the prostate. For this reason, we exposed CD1 mice to a 1:1 mixture of TBECH diastereomers α and β, a 1:1 mixture of γ and δ, and to DPTE, and tested their effects on prostate growth, histology and gene expression profiles. Castrated mice were used to study the androgenic effects of TBECHαβ and TBECHγδ while the antagonistic effects of DPTE were studied in non-castrated mice. We observed that testosterone and TBECHγδ increased body and prostate weights while TBECHαβ affected neither of them; and that DPTE had no effect on body weight but reduced prostate weight drastically. Histomorphometric analysis of the prostate revealed epithelial and glandular alterations in the TBECHγδ group comparable to those in testosterone group while alterations in the TBECHαβ group were less pronounced. DPTE displayed androgen antagonist activity reminiscent of castration. The transcription profile of the prostate was altered by castration and exposure to testosterone and to TBECHγδ reversed several of these changes. Testosterone and TBECHγδ also regulated the expression of several androgen responsive genes implicated in prostate growth and cancer. While DPTE resulted in a drastic reduction in prostate weight, it only affected a small number of genes.

PEITC has been reported to reduce the risk of many cancers including prostate cancer (PCa). In this study, male TRAMP mice were fed a control diet or diet containing 0.05% PEITC from 8 weeks to 16 weeks. The tumor incidence was reduced in the PEITC diet (0/6) as compared with the control diet (6/7). RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses on nontumor and tumor prostatic tissues revealed several pathways like cell cycle/Cdc42 signaling, inflammation, and cancer-related signaling, were activated in prostate tissues of TRAMP mice but were reversed or attenuated in TRAMP mice fed with PEITC diet. DNA CpG methyl-seq analyses showed that global methylation patterns of prostate samples from TRAMP mice were hugely different from those of wild-type mice. Dietary PEITC partially reversed the global methylation changes during prostatic carcinogenesis. Integration of RNA-seq and DNA methyl-seq analyses identified a list of genes, including Adgrb1 and Ebf4, with an inverse regulatory relationship between their RNA expression and CpG methylation. In summary, our current study demonstrates that alteration of the global epigenome in TRAMP prostate tumor and PEITC administration suppresses PCa carcinogenesis, impacts global CpG epigenome and transcriptome, and attenuates carcinogenic pathways like cell cycle arrest and inflammation.

This study aimed to explore the role of PlncRNA-1 in the progression of prostate cancer (PCa). We found that PlncRNA-1 was up-regulated in 85.29% of PCa tissues and could predict the T stage of PCa patients to a certain extent. Results showed that inhibition of PlncRNA-1 expression potentially promoted cell apoptosis, suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cells, and triggered G2/M cycle arrest in vitro and in vivo. PlncRNA-1 was mainly localized in the nucleus and PlncRNA-1 expression and phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) expression were negatively correlated. Mechanistically, knockdown of PlncRNA-1 increased expression levels of PTEN protein and phosphorylated PTEN protein, and decreased expression levels of Akt protein and phosphorylated Akt protein.

Methods:   For this randomised, phase 2 and multicenter trial, we enrolled patients with lung carcinoma and multifocal bone metastases and excluded patients who had received bisphosphonates or external-beam radiotherapy within the previous 4 weeks. Fifty-four patients were randomized to receive a single injection of 188Re-HEDP, at doses of 30, 40 or 50 MBq/kg (interval, 12 weeks).

These concurrent symptoms can form a cluster. In this study, we aimed to investigate classes of this symptom cluster in long-term PC survivors, to classify PC survivors accordingly, and to explore associations between classes of this cluster and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).  Methods:   Six hundred fifty-three stage T1-T3N0M0 survivors were identified from the Prostate Cancer Survivorship in Switzerland (PROCAS) study. Fatigue was assessed with the EORTC QLQ-FA12, depressive symptoms with the MHI-5, and pain with the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Latent class analysis was used to derive cluster classes. Factors associated with the derived classes were determined using multinomial logistic regression analysis.  Results:   Three classes were identified: class 1 (61.4%) - ""low pain, low physical and emotional fatigue, moderate depressive symptoms""; class 2 (15.1%) - ""low physical fatigue and pain, moderate emotional fatigue, high depressive symptoms""; class 3 (23.5%) - high scores for all symptoms. Survivors in classes 2 and 3 were more likely to be physically inactive, report a history of depression or some other specific comorbidity, be treated with radiation therapy, and have worse HRQoL outcomes compared to class 1.

LATITUDE studies have confirmed that the combination of abiraterone and prednisone (5 mg/d) can be used for the treatment of newly diagnosed high-risk metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer, and have achieved satisfactory results. However, it has not been reported that abiraterone combined with prednisone (5 mg/d) in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Patient concerns:   Here, we present a case of high-risk advanced prostate cancer with old pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). The patient developed a relapse of old tuberculosis in both lungs that were discovered following 14 months of continuous application of prednisone (10 mg/d).  Diagnosis:   The histopathological findings showed prostate adenocarcinoma carcinoma with a Gleason score of 10 (5+5). Further laboratory investigations were suggestive of positive mycobacterium tuberculosis complex DNA in pleural effusion and sputum.  Interventions:   The patient underwent endocrine therapy, chemotherapy of docetaxel plus prednisone, radiotherapy, and abiraterone combined with prednisone treatment, but he eventually developed into the mCRPC stage. Then, prednisone was reduced to 5 mg/d plus abiraterone, and combined with anti-tuberculosis treatment according to multi-disciplinary diagnosis and treatment.  Outcome:   Two months later, pleural effusion and atelectasis were relieved, and PSA was remained stable at a low level. The patient achieved complete remission.  Conclusion:   We cannot, with complete certainty, say that this patient, or any patient, developed old PTB recurrence due to the use of prednisone. Based on the current evidence, endocrine therapy is the foundation, radiotherapy can reduce the tumor load, and early application of abiraterone is beneficial to survival for the high-risk mCRPC. The long-term use of prednisone can be appropriately reduced in mCRPC with old PTB, and a satisfactory curative effect can be achieved. More prospective trials are warranted before a definite recommendation could be drawn.""","""['Xiaojuan Zhu', 'Zhenguo Shi', 'Shegan Gao', 'Xiaohong Wang', 'Pei Wang', 'Chongzhao Kang', 'Fangzong Zhao', 'Peng Hou']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Antitumour Activity and Safety of Enzalutamide in Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Previously Treated with Abiraterone Acetate Plus Prednisone for ≥24 weeks in Europe.', 'The Phase 3 COU-AA-302 Study of Abiraterone Acetate Plus Prednisone in Men with Chemotherapy-naïve Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Stratified Analysis Based on Pain, Prostate-specific Antigen, and Gleason Score.', 'Subsequent Chemotherapy and Treatment Patterns After Abiraterone Acetate in Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Post Hoc Analysis of COU-AA-302.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database of the National Cancer Institute, we identified a total of 510 patients with NEPC between 2006 and 2015. Age-adjusted incidence rates were evaluated in the study by the SEER∗Stat Software version 8.3.6. Kaplan-Meier analysed assessed overall survival (OS) after stratification according to marital status, age, histologic subtype, metastatic status, and treatment. The significant differences were assessed in a log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate cox hazard regression analysis were performed to determine independent predictors of OS.  Results:   From a total of 560,124 patients with prostate cancer diagnosed between 2006 and 2015, we identified 510 cases of de novo NEPC. Regarding histology, among all the NEPC, 329 (64.5%) patients were diagnosed as small cell carcinoma, 181 (39.8%) were nonsmall cell carcinoma. The overall age-adjusted incidence of NEPC statistically significantly increased from 0.321/1,000,000 person-years in 2006 to 0.587/1,000,000 person-years in 2015. The median OS in our study cohort was 9 months (95% CI, 8-10 months). Multivariate cox regression analysis showed that age, histologic subtype, and stage were independent prognostic factors for NEPC patients. The majority of NEPC (78.2%) were metastatic at diagnosis. In terms of treatment, for metastatic tumor patients, chemotherapy was the most effective therapy. Chemotherapy increased the OS of patients with regional (distant) metastases from 8 months (5 months) to 13.5 months (9 months).  Conclusion:   NEPC is extremely rare but the incidence of NEPC has been increasing in the past years. The prognosis of NEPC is poor because most cases are diagnosed at metastatic stage. The patients with metastases are typically treated with chemotherapy and chemotherapy shows survival benefits in both regional and distant metastatic tumor patients.""","""['Jiamin Zhu', 'Xiao Liang', 'Dan Wu', 'Shusen Chen', 'Baixia Yang', 'Weidong Mao', 'Dong Shen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Contemporary Incidence and Cancer Control Outcomes of Primary Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer: A SEER Database Analysis.', 'Clinical features of neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Neuroendocrine Carcinoma as an Independent Prognostic Factor for Patients With Prostate Cancer: A Population-Based Study.', 'Clinical and Biological Features of Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer (NEPC) progressing from conventional prostatic adenocarcinoma: factors associated with time to development of NEPC and survival from NEPC diagnosis-a systematic review and pooled analysis.', 'Primary Neuroendocrine Tumor of Prostate in a Case of Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of Lung: Rare Entity with Histopathological and Gallium 68 DOTANOC Positron Emission Tomography Correlation.', 'Targeting P21-Activated Kinase-1 for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'A Theranostic Small-Molecule Prodrug Conjugate for Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'COVID-19 in people with neurofibromatosis 1, neurofibromatosis 2, or schwannomatosis.', 'The Value of Phenotypic Precision Medicine in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Purpose To evaluate features of preoperative MRI and MRI-guided biopsy immunohistochemistry (IHC) findings associated with biochemical recurrence (BCR) of prostate cancer after surgery. Materials and Methods In this retrospective case-control study, patients underwent multiparametric MRI before MRI-guided biopsy followed by radical prostatectomy between 2008 and 2016. Lesions were retrospectively scored with the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) (version 2) by radiologists who were blinded to the clinical-pathologic results. The IHC staining, including stains for the ETS-related gene, phosphatase and tensin homolog, androgen receptor, prostate specific antigen, and p53, was performed with targeted biopsy specimens of the index lesion (highest suspicion at MRI and pathologic grade) and scored by pathologists who were blinded to clinical-pathologic outcomes. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to evaluate associations with recurrence-free survival (RFS). Results The median RFS was 31.7 months (range, 1-101 months) for 39 patients (median age, 62 years; age range, 47-76 years) without BCR and 14.6 months (range, 1-61 months) for 40 patients (median age, 59 years; age range, 47-73 years) with BCR. MRI features that showed a significant relationship with the RFS interval included an index lesion with a PI-RADS score of 5 (hazard ratio [HR], 2.10; 95% CI: 1.05, 4.21; P = .04); index lesion burden, defined as ratio of index lesion volume to prostate volume (HR, 1.55; 95% CI: 1.2, 2.1; P = .003); and suspicion of extraprostatic extension (EPE) (HR, 2.18; 95% CI: 1.1, 4.2; P = .02). Presurgical multivariable analysis indicated that suspicion of EPE at MRI (adjusted HR, 2.19; 95% CI: 1.1, 4.3; P = .02) and p53 stain intensity (adjusted HR, 2.22; 95% CI: 1.0, 4.7; P = .04) were significantly associated with RFS. Conclusion MRI features, including Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System score, index lesion burden, extraprostatic extension, and preoperative guided biopsy p53 immunohistochemistry stain intensity are associated with biochemical relapse of prostate cancer after surgery. © RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

Methods:   Nine men, three with high-risk localised prostate cancer, three with treatment-naïve hormone-sensitive metastatic disease and three with castration-resistant metastatic disease, underwent dynamic 45-min PET scanning of a target area immediately post-injection of 300 MBq 18F-rhPSMA-7.3, followed by two whole-body PET/CT scans acquired from 60 and 90 min post-injection. Volumes of interest (VoIs) corresponding to prostate cancer lesions and reference tissues were recorded. Standardised uptake values (SUV) and lesion-to-reference ratios were calculated for 3 time frames: 35-45, 60-88 and 90-118 min. Net influx rates (Ki) were calculated using Patlak plots.  Results:   Altogether, 44 lesions from the target area were identified. Optimal visual lesion detection started 60 min post-injection. The 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 signal from prostate cancer lesions increased over time, while reference tissue signals remained stable or decreased. The mean (SD) SUV (g/mL) at the 3 time frames were 8.4 (5.6), 10.1 (7) and 10.6 (7.5), respectively, for prostate lesions, 11.2 (4.3), 13 (4.8) and 14 (5.2) for lymph node metastases, and 4.6 (2.6), 5.7 (3.1) and 6.4 (3.5) for bone metastases. The mean (SD) lesion-to-reference ratio increases from the earliest to the 2 later time frames were 40% (10) and 59% (9), respectively, for the prostate, 65% (27) and 125% (47) for metastatic lymph nodes and 25% (19) and 32% (30) for bone lesions. Patlak plots from lesion VoIs signified almost irreversible uptake kinetics. Ki, SUV and lesion-to-reference ratio estimates showed good agreement.  Conclusion: 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 uptake in prostate cancer lesions was high. Lesion-to-background ratios increased over time, with optimal visual detection starting from 60 min post-injection.

A promising approach to overcome the posed barriers is conjugating tumor-homing peptides to drugs or nanocarriers. Such high-affinity peptides can specifically target surface markers overexpressed by cancer cells, ensuring a rapid and cancer-specific uptake of the drugs. Since prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is overexpressed by aggressive prostate cancer cells, targeting this surface protein with peptide conjugates can lead to the development of effective strategies against prostate cancer. In this study, we aimed to determine which PSMA-binding peptide among peptides 563, 562 and 9-mer, show the highest selectivity towards PSMA using 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells, a cell line with moderate PSMA levels. Tumor-homing peptides were synthesized by fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-based solid-phase peptide synthesis (Fmoc-SPPS) strategy, and evaluated for their prostate cancer cell-specific targeting efficiencies by flow cytometry. Our results showed that the PSMA-binding capacity of peptide 563 was superior to those of 562, 9-mer, and 5-mer; therefore, can be utilized as a potent-targeting agent not only in the treatment of high PSMA positive but also moderate PSMA positive prostate cancer tumors.""","""['Ayca Ece Nezir', 'Melek Parlak Khalily', 'Sevgi Gulyuz', 'Salih Ozcubukcu', 'Ş Güniz Küçükgüzel', 'Ozgur Yilmaz', 'Dilek Telci']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Amino Acids""","""['Discovery of PSMA-specific peptide ligands for targeted drug delivery.', 'Synthesis and biological evaluation of copper-64 radiolabeled DUPA-6-Ahx-(NODAGA)-5-Ava-BBN(7-14)NH2, a novel bivalent targeting vector having affinity for two distinct biomarkers (GRPr/PSMA) of prostate cancer.', 'Disulfide-constrained peptides that bind to the extracellular portion of the prostate-specific membrane antigen.', 'GCPII imaging and cancer.', 'Current application and future perspectives of prostate specific membrane antigen PET imaging in prostate cancer.', 'Targeting prostate cancer with docetaxel-loaded peptide 563-conjugated PEtOx-co-PEI30%-b-PCL polymeric micelle nanocarriers.']"""

The aim of this study was to explore the role and mechanism of SChLAP1 in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). The expression of SChLAP1 in TNBC tissues and cells was determined by reverse transcription quantitative PCR. The effects of SChLAP1 on the growth of TNBC cells was evaluated by detecting cell viability, colony formation and apoptosis. The present study determined that SChLAP1 was upregulated in TNBC tissues and was associated with the long‑distant lymph node metastasis of patients with TNBC. Knockdown of SChLAP1 significantly inhibited cell viability and colony formation, and triggered apoptosis of TNBC cells. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that SChLAP1 acted as a sponge of microRNA (miR)‑524‑5p and negatively modulated the expression of miR‑524‑5p. An inverse correlation was also identified between the expression levels of SChLAP1 and miR‑524‑5p in TNBC tissues.

The present study aimed to examine the effects of long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA) MIR4435‑2HG binding with ST8SIA1 on the proliferation, invasion and migration of prostate cancer cells via the activation of the FAK/AKT/β‑catenin signaling pathway. The expression of MIR4435‑2HG and ST8SIA1 in prostate cancer cell lines, and the transfection efficacy were analyzed by RT‑qPCR. The proliferation, clone formation ability, and the invasion and migration of transfected cells were detected by CCK‑8 assay, clone formation assay, Transwell assay and wound healing assay, respectively. Plasmids were injected subcutaneously into mice to construct a xenograft tumor model. The expression levels of proteins related to proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and migration, and the FAK/AKT/β‑catenin pathway were detected by western blot analysis. The results revealed that MIR4435‑2HG expression was increased in the prostate cancer cell lines and MIR4435‑2HG expression was the highest in the PC‑3 cells. Interference with MIR4435‑2HG inhibited the proliferation, clone formation ability, and the invasion and migration of PC‑3 cells, as well as tumor growth by suppressing the activation of the FAK/AKT/β‑catenin signaling pathway.

Using RNA-Seq analysis, we discovered that CREB1 plays a central role in maintaining new luminal cell survival and that oncogenesis dramatically changes the CREB1-induced transcriptome. CREB1 is active in luminal cells, but not basal cells. We identified ING4 and its E3 ligase, JFK, as CREB1 transcriptional targets in luminal cells. During luminal cell differentiation, transient induction of ING4 expression is followed by a peak in CREB1 activity, while JFK increases concomitantly with CREB1 activation. Transient expression of ING4 is required for luminal cell induction; however, failure to properly down-regulate ING4 leads to luminal cell death. Consequently, blocking CREB1 increased ING4 expression, suppressed JFK, and led to luminal cell death. Thus, CREB1 is responsible for the suppression of ING4 required for luminal cell survival and maintenance. Oncogenic transformation by suppressing PTEN resulted in constitutive activation of CREB1. However, the tumor cells could no longer fully differentiate into luminal cells, failed to express ING4, and displayed a unique CREB1 transcriptome. Blocking CREB1 in tumorigenic cells suppressed tumor growth in vivo, rescued ING4 expression, and restored luminal cell formation, but ultimately induced luminal cell death. IHC of primary prostate tumors demonstrated a strong correlation between loss of ING4 and loss of PTEN. This is the first study to define a molecular mechanism whereby oncogenic loss of PTEN, leading to aberrant CREB1 activation, suppresses ING4 expression causing disruption of luminal cell differentiation.""","""['M J Watson', 'P L Berger', 'K Banerjee', 'S B Frank', 'L Tang', 'S S Ganguly', 'G Hostetter', 'M Winn', 'C K Miranti']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Transient induction of ING4 by Myc drives prostate epithelial cell differentiation and its disruption drives prostate tumorigenesis.', 'Miz1, a Novel Target of ING4, Can Drive Prostate Luminal Epithelial Cell Differentiation.', 'SCF(JFK) is a bona fide E3 ligase for ING4 and a potent promoter of the angiogenesis and metastasis of breast cancer.', 'Adenovirus-mediated co-expression of ING4 and PTEN cooperatively enhances their antitumor activity in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells.', 'Disruption of prostate epithelial differentiation pathways and prostate cancer development.', 'miR-125b-5p upregulation by TRIM28 induces cisplatin resistance in non-small cell lung cancer through CREB1 inhibition.', 'MicroRNA-582-5p targeting Creb1 modulates apoptosis in cardiomyocytes hypoxia/reperfusion-induced injury.', 'CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of Interleukin-30 suppresses IGF1 and CXCL5 and boosts SOCS3 reducing prostate cancer growth and mortality.', 'CircEZH2/miR-133b/IGF2BP2 aggravates colorectal cancer progression via enhancing the stability of m6A-modified CREB1 mRNA.', 'ING Tumour Suppressors and ING Splice Variants as Coregulators of the Androgen Receptor Signalling in Prostate Cancer.']"""

While CT is generally considered insufficient to diagnose PCa due to its inferior soft tissue characterisation, our evaluations on a relatively large dataset consisting of 139 clinically significant PCa patients and 432 controls show that the proposed deep neural network pipeline can detect csPCa patients at a level that is suitable for incidental detection. The proposed pipeline achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.88 (95% Confidence Interval: 0.86-0.90) at patient level csPCa detection on CT, significantly higher than the AUCs achieved by two radiologists (0.61 and 0.70) on the same task.""","""['Steven Korevaar', 'Ruwan Tennakoon', 'Mark Page', 'Peter Brotchie', 'John Thangarajah', 'Cosmin Florescu', 'Tom Sutherland', 'Ning Mao Kam', 'Alireza Bab-Hadiashar']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Prostate Cancer Detection using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Computer-aided diagnosis of prostate cancer using a deep convolutional neural network from multiparametric MRI.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Convolutional neural networks for computer-aided detection or diagnosis in medical image analysis: An overview.', 'Artificial intelligence in urology-opportunities and possibilities.', 'Artificial Intelligence for Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Advanced nanoengineered-customized point-of-care tools for prostate-specific antigen.']"""

Previously, we functionally validated an aggressive subtype present in 15% of prostate cancer characterized by dual deletion of MAP3K7 and CHD1. Recent studies in the field have focused on deletion of CHD1 and its role in androgen receptor (AR) chromatin distribution and resistance to AR-targeted therapy; however, CHD1 is rarely lost without codeletion of MAP3K7. Here, we show that in the clinically relevant context of co-loss of MAP3K7 and CHD1 there are significant, collective changes to aspects of AR signaling. Although CHD1 loss mainly impacts the expansion of the AR cistrome, loss of MAP3K7 drives increased AR target gene expression. Prostate cancer cell line models engineered to cosuppress MAP3K7 and CHD1 also demonstrated increased AR-v7 expression and resistance to the AR-targeting drug enzalutamide. Furthermore, we determined that low protein expression of both genes is significantly associated with biochemical recurrence (BCR) in a clinical cohort of radical prostatectomy specimens. Low MAP3K7 expression, however, was the strongest independent predictor for risk of BCR over all other tested clinicopathologic factors including CHD1 expression. Collectively, these findings illustrate the importance of MAP3K7 loss in a molecular subtype of prostate cancer that poses challenges to conventional therapeutic approaches.

However, combined Bx subjects patients to higher number of Bx cores and greater detection of clinically insignificant PCa.  Objective:   To determine if prebiopsy prostate MRI can identify men who could forgo combined Bx without a substantial risk of missing clinically significant PCa (csPC).  Design, setting, and participants:   Men with MRI-visible prostate lesions underwent combined TBx plus SBx.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary outcomes were detection rates for grade group (GG) ≥2 and GG ≥3 PCa by TBx and SBx, stratified by Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score.  Results and limitations:   Among PI-RADS 5 cases, nearly all csPCs were detected by TBx, as adding SBx resulted in detection of only 2.5% more GG ≥2 cancers. Among PI-RADS 3-4 cases, however, SBx addition resulted in detection of substantially more csPCs than TBx alone (8% vs 7.5%). Conversely, TBx added little to detection of csPC among men with PI-RADS 2 lesions (2%) relative to SBx (7.8%).  Conclusions:   While combined Bx increases the detection of csPC among men with MRI-visible prostate lesions, this benefit was largely restricted to PI-RADS 3-4 lesions. Using a strategy of TBx only for PI-RADS 5 and combined Bx only for PI-RADS 3-4 would avoid excess biopsies for men with PI-RADS 5 lesions while resulting in a low risk of missing csPC (1%).  Patient summary:   Our study investigated an optimized strategy to diagnose aggressive prostate cancer in men with an abnormal prostate MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan while minimizing the risk of excess biopsies. We used a scoring system for MRI scan images called PI-RADS. The results show that MRI-targeted biopsies alone could be used for men with a PI-RADS score of 5, while men with a PI-RADS score of 3 or 4 would benefit from a combination of MRI-targeted biopsy and systematic biopsy.

While human bone marrow-derived stromal cells (hBMSC, also known as mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)) are frequently described in therapeutic applications, or disease modeling, their behavior following direct injection into murine bone marrow is poorly characterized. Herein, we characterized hBMSC engraftment and persistence within the bone marrow of NOD-scid interleukin (IL)-2γ-/- (NSG) mice with or without prior 2 Gy total-body γ-irradiation of recipient mice.  Methods:   One day after conditioning NSG mice with sublethal irradiation, 5 × 105 luciferase (Luc) and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing hBMSC (hBMSC-Luc/GFP) were injected into the right femurs of animals. hBMSC-Luc/GFP were tracked in live animals using IVIS imaging, and histology was used to further characterize hBMSC location and behavior in tissues.  Results:   hBMSC-Luc/GFP number within injected marrow cavities declined rapidly over 4 weeks, but prior irradiation of animals delayed this decline. At 4 weeks, hBMSC-Luc/GFP colonized injected marrow cavities and distal marrow cavities at rates of 2.5 ± 2.2% and 1.7 ± 1.9% of total marrow nucleated cells, respectively in both irradiated and non-irradiated mice. In distal marrow cavities, hBMSC were not uniformly distributed and appeared to be co-localized in clusters, with the majority found in the endosteal region.  Conclusions:   While significant numbers of hBMSC-Luc/GFP could be deposited into the mouse bone marrow via direct bone marrow injection, IVIS imaging indicated that the number of hBMSC-Luc/GFP in that bone marrow cavity declined with time. Irradiation of mice prior to transplant only delayed the rate of hBMSC-Luc/GFP population decline in injected femurs. Clusters of hBMSC-Luc/GFP were observed in the histology of distal marrow cavities, suggesting that some transplanted cells actively homed to distal marrow cavities. Individual cell clusters may have arisen from discrete clones that homed to the marrow, and then underwent modest proliferation. The transient high-density population of hBMSC within the injected femur, or the longer-term low-density population of hBMSC in distal marrow cavities, offers useful models for studying disease or regenerative processes.

We therefore investigated CD276 expression in bladder cancer (BC) cells and in tissue samples of BC stages from pT2 to pT4.  Methods:   CD276 expression was explored in 4 urothelial cancer cell lines and 4 primary normal urothelial cell populations by quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot and flow cytometry. CD276 was investigated in bladder tumors from 98 patients by immunohistochemistry using a score (0-300) incorporating both, staining intensity and area of CD276 staining. Normal appearing urothelium in the bladder of the same patients served as controls.  Results:   The urothelial carcinoma cell lines expressed significantly higher levels of CD276 on transcript (p < 0.006), total protein levels (p < 0.005), and on the cell surface (p < 0.02) when compared to normal urothelial cells.

Methods:   In this paper, we set out to compare conventional and reference-free signatures in risk and relapse prediction of prostate cancer. To compare the two approaches as fairly as possible, we set up a common procedure that takes as input either a k-mer count matrix or a gene expression matrix, extracts a signature and evaluates this signature in an independent dataset.  Results:   We find that both gene-based and k-mer based classifiers had similarly high performances for risk prediction and a markedly lower performance for relapse prediction.

Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression analysis were used to compare patients with (n = 19) and without (n = 41) BCF.  Results:   Overall, 13.2% of patients had PSMs, and of those, 31.7% experienced BCF during follow-up. The mean follow-up duration was 43.7 months (42.4 [non-BCF] vs 46.35 (BCF], p = 0.51). In univariant analyses, the platelet to lymphocyte ratio (6.26 [non-BCF] vs 8.02 [BCF], p = 0.04) differed statistically. When patients were grouped by pathologic grade ≦2 or ≧3 (p = 0.004), the BCF-free survival rates differed significantly. Seminal vesicle invasion also differed significantly (5 [non-BCF] vs 7 [BCF], p = 0.005). Patients with undetectable nadir prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after RARP (BCF rate 4/34) differed statistically from those with detectable PSA after RARP (BCF rate 15/26) (p < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, the platelet/lymphocyte (P/L) ratio, pathologic grade, and undetectable nadir PSA remained statistically significant.  Conclusions:   In patients who undergo RARP and have PSMs, P/L ratio >9 preoperatively, pathologic grade ⩾3, and detectable nadir PSA after RARP should be considered adverse features. Early intervention such as salvage radiation therapy or androgen deprivation therapy should be offered to these patients.""","""['Shih-Huan Su', 'Ying-Hsu Chang', 'Liang-Kang Huang', 'Yuan-Cheng Chu', 'Hung-Cheng Kan', 'Chung-Yi Liu', 'Po-Hung Lin', 'Kai-Jie Yu', 'Chun-Te Wu', 'See-Tong Pang', 'Cheng-Keng Chuang', 'I-Hung Shao']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Tumori""","""['Technical Refinements in Superextended Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy for Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer Patients at Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging.', 'Retzius-sparing Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Leads to Durable Improvement in Urinary Function and Quality of Life Versus Standard Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Without Compromise on Oncologic Efficacy: Single-surgeon Series and Step-by-step Guide.', 'Predictive factors and oncological outcomes of persistently elevated prostate-specific antigen in patients following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting oncologic outcome after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.']"""

A reliable in vitro assay that simulates osteoclastic resorption in vivo would significantly speed up the process of developing effective therapeutic solutions for those diseases. Here, we reported the development of a novel and robust nanostructured calcium phosphate coating with unique functions on the track-etched porous membrane by using an ammonia-induced mineralization (AiM) technique. The calcium phosphate coating uniformly covers one side of the PET membrane, enabling testing for osteoclastic resorption. The track-etched pores in the PET membrane allow calcium phosphate mineral pins to grow inside, which, on the one hand, enhances coating integration with a membrane substrate and, on the other hand, provides diffusion channels for delivering drugs from the lower chamber of a double-chamber cell culture system. The applications of the processed calcium phosphate coating were first demonstrated as a drug screening device by using alendronate, a widely used drug for osteoporosis. It was confirmed that the delivery of alendronate significantly decreased both the number of monocyte-differentiated osteoclasts and coating resorption. To demonstrate the application in studying bone metastasis, we delivered a PC3 prostate cancer-conditioned medium and confirmed that both the differentiation of monocytes into osteoclasts and the osteoclastic resorption of the calcium phosphate coating were significantly enhanced. This novel assay thus provides a new platform for studying osteoclastic activities and assessing drug efficacy in vitro.""","""['Sijia Chen', 'Qiong Wang', 'Felipe Eltit', 'Yubin Guo', 'Michael Cox', 'Rizhi Wang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""ACS Appl Mater Interfaces""","""['Effects of alendronate on bone formation and osteoclastic resorption after implantation of beta-tricalcium phosphate.', 'Evaluation of osteoclastic resorption activity using calcium phosphate coating combined with labeled polyanion.', 'Strontium substitution in apatitic CaP cements effectively attenuates osteoclastic resorption but does not inhibit osteoclastogenesis.', 'Bisphosphonates: preclinical aspects and use in osteoporosis.', 'Preclinical evidence of normal bone with alendronate.']"""

Objective:   To examine whether cancer transitions exist in the US, select European countries, and Japan.  Design, setting, and participants:   In this cross-sectional study, annual cause-of-death data from the 1950s to 2018 for the US, England and Wales, France, Sweden, Norway, and Japan were extracted from the Human Mortality Database and the World Health Organization (WHO). Statistical analysis was performed from April 2020 to February 2021.  Main outcomes and measures:   Age-standardized death rates for all ages and both sexes combined were estimated for cancers of the stomach, cervix, liver, lung, pancreas, esophagus, colorectum, breast, and prostate.  Results:   The results of the analysis show that for all countries in this study except for Japan, mortality from infectious-related cancers has declined steadily throughout the period, so that by the end of the period, for Norway, England and Wales, Sweden, and the US, rates were approximately 20 deaths per 100 000 population. Regarding noninfectious-related cancers, at the beginning of the period, all countries exhibited an increasing trend in rates, with England and Wales having the greatest peak of 215.1 deaths per 100 000 population (95% CI 213.7-216.6 deaths per 100 000 population) in 1985 followed by a decline, with most of the other countries reaching a peak around 1990 and declining thereafter. Furthermore, there is a visible crossover in the trends for infectious-related and noninfectious-related cancers in Japan and Norway. This crossover occurred in 1988 in Japan, when the rates for both types of cancers stood at 116 per 100 000 population (95% CI, 115.0-116.5 per 100 000 population), and in 1955 in Norway, when they passed each other at 100 per 100 000 population (95% CI, 96.4-105.3 per 100 000 population).  Conclusions and relevance:   In this cross-sectional study, the findings suggest that cancer mortality patterns parallel the epidemiological transition, which states that as nations develop, they move from a stage where infectious diseases are prominent to one where noninfectious diseases dominate. An implication is that the epidemiological transition theory as originally formulated continues to be relevant, despite some researchers arguing that there should be additional stages beyond the original 3.""","""['Omer Gersten', 'Magali Barbieri']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Cancer mortality in Europe in 2015 and an overview of trends since 1990.', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Cancer mortality in the elderly in 11 countries worldwide, 1970-2015.', 'Cancer, cigarette smoking and premature death in Europe: a review including the Recommendations of European Cancer Experts Consensus Meeting, Helsinki, October 1996.', 'Postneonatal Mortality.', 'The Looming Threat: Cancer in Sub-Saharan Africa.']"""

The assessment of an existing prediction models using data with missing covariate values is challenging. In this article, we propose inverse probability weighted (IPW) and augmented inverse probability weighted (AIPW) estimates of AUC and BS to handle the missing data. An alternative approach uses multiple imputation (MI), which requires a model for the distribution of the missing variable. We evaluated the performance of IPW and AIPW in comparison with MI in simulation studies under missing completely at random, missing at random, and missing not at random scenarios. When there are missing observations in the data, MI and IPW can be used to obtain unbiased estimates of BS and AUC if the imputation model for the missing variable or the model for the missingness is correctly specified. MI is more efficient than IPW. Our simulation results suggest that AIPW can be more efficient than IPW, and also achieves double robustness from miss-specification of either the missingness model or the imputation model. The outcome variable should be included in the model for the missing variable under all scenarios, while it only needs to be included in missingness model if the missingness depends on the outcome.

NSC765598 is a novel small molecule derivative of salicylanilide. This study aims to investigate the ligand-protein interactions of NSC765598 with its potential targets and to evaluate its anticancer activities in vitro. Methods:   We used multi-computational tools and clinical databases, respectively, to identify the potential drug target for NSC765598 and analyze the genetic profile and prognostic relevance of the targets in multiple cancers. We evaluated the in vitro anticancer activities against the National Cancer Institute 60 (NCI60) human tumor cell lines and used molecular docking to study the ligand-protein interactions. Finally, we used the DTP-COMPARE algorithm to compare the NSC765598 anticancer fingerprints with NCI standard agents.  Results:   We identified mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)/mitogen-activated protein 2 kinase 1 (MAP2K1)/fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)/transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFB1) as potential targets for NSC765598. The targets were enriched in cancer-associated pathways, were overexpressed and were of prognostic relevance in multiple cancers. Among the identified targets, genetic alterations occurred most frequently in EGFR (7%), particularly in glioblastoma, esophageal squamous cell cancer, head and neck squamous cell cancer, and non-small-cell lung cancer, and were associated with poor prognoses and survival of patients, while other targets were less frequently altered. NSC765598 displayed selective antiproliferative and cytotoxic preferences for NSCLC (50% growth inhibition (GI50) = 1.12-3.95 µM; total growth inhibition (TGI) = 3.72-16.60 μM), leukemia (GI50 = 1.20-3.10 µM; TGI = 3.90-12.70 μM), melanoma (GI50 = 1.45-3.59 µM), and renal cancer (GI50 = 1.38-3.40 µM; TGI = 4.84-13.70 μM) cell lines, while panels of colon, breast, ovarian, prostate, and central nervous system (CNS) cancer cell lines were less sensitive to NSC765598. Interestingly, NSC765598 docked well into the binding cavity of the targets by conventional H-bonds, van der Waal forces, and a variety of π-interactions, with higher preferences for EGFR (ΔG = -11.0 kcal/mol), NOS2 (ΔG = -11.0 kcal/mol), and mTOR (ΔG = -8.8 kcal/mol). NSC765598 shares similar anti-cancer fingerprints with NCI standard agents displayed acceptable physicochemical values and met the criteria of drug-likeness.

To bridge that gap, we developed a microfluidic, non-contact, and low-input volume compatible acoustic trapping technology for EV isolation that enabled downstream small RNA sequencing. In the current study, we have further automated the acoustic microfluidics-based EV enrichment technique that enables us to serially process 32 clinical samples per run. We utilized the system to enrich EVs from urine collected as the first morning void from 207 men referred to 10-core prostate biopsy performed the same day. Using automated acoustic trapping, we successfully enriched EVs from 199/207 samples (96%). After RNA extraction, size selection, and library preparation, a total of 173/199 samples (87%) provided sufficient materials for next-generation sequencing that generated an average of 2 × 106 reads per sample mapping to the human reference genome. The predominant RNA species identified were fragments of long RNAs such as protein coding and retained introns, whereas small RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNA) accounted for less than 1% of the reads suggesting that partially degraded long RNAs out-competed miRNAs during sequencing. We found that the expression of six miRNAs was significantly different (Padj < 0.05) in EVs isolated from patients found to have high grade prostate cancer [ISUP 2005 Grade Group (GG) 4 or higher] compared to those with GG3 or lower, including those with no evidence of prostate cancer at biopsy. These included miR-23b-3p, miR-27a-3p, and miR-27b-3p showing higher expression in patients with GG4 or high grade prostate cancer, whereas miR-1-3p, miR-10a-5p, and miR-423-3p had lower expression in the GG4 PCa cases. Cross referencing our differentially expressed miRNAs to two large prostate cancer datasets revealed that the putative tumor suppressors miR-1, miR-23b, and miR-27a are consistently deregulated in prostate cancer.

Health-promoting characteristics were examined by studying the inhibition of enzymes as a drug target for diabetes, hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, and obesity, together with anticancer ability against human colorectal adenocarcinoma, human hepatocellular carcinoma, human ovarian carcinoma, human prostate adenocarcinoma, and human lung carcinoma. Besides, FD genotoxicity was tested using the Drosophila wing spot test. Results showed that both FD root and latex exhibited antioxidant activity due to the presence of phenolics and flavonoids, specifically caffeic acid and cyanidin. The ethanolic fraction of FD root demonstrated a potent antidiabetic mechanism underlying α-glucosidase inhibitory activity similar to acarbose.

Developing new therapeutic approaches and diagnostic biomarkers for prostate cancer (PC) is a significant need. The Chinese herbal medicine Panax quinquefolius saponins (PQS) have been reported to show anti-tumor effects. We hypothesized that PQS exhibits anti-cancer activity in human PC cells and we aimed to search for novel biomarkers allowing early diagnosis of PC.  Methods:   We used the human PC cell line DU145 and the prostate epithelial cell line PNT2 to perform cell viability assays, flow cytometric analysis of the cell cycle, and FACS-based apoptosis assays. Microarray-based gene expression analysis was used to display specific gene expression patterns and to search for novel biomarkers. Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR were performed to demonstrate the expression levels of multiple cancer-related genes.  Results:   Our data showed that PQS inhibited the viability of DU145 cells and induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. A significant decrease in DU145 cell invasion and migration were observed after 24 h treatment by PQS. PQS up-regulated the expression levels of p21, p53, TMEM79, ACOXL, ETV5, and SPINT1 while it down-regulated the expression levels of bcl2, STAT3, FANCD2, DRD2, and TMPRSS2.  Conclusion:   PQS promoted cells apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation of DU145 cells, which suggests that PQS may be effective for treating PC.

We used the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression to analyze survival outcomes and logistic regression to study the association between the presence of brain metastasis and potential risk variables. Exclusion criteria were the presence of neuroendocrine and small cell histology. RESULTS The study included 14 753 patients. Of these, 187 patients were in group 1 (with brain metastasis) and 14 566 were in group 2 (without brain metastasis). When comparing the metastases distribution at the time of initial presentation between group 1 and group 2, the occurrence of bone metastasis was similar in the 2 groups (87% vs 90%); however, liver metastasis (13% vs 4%) and lung metastasis (29% vs 7%) were significantly higher in group 1. We found a strong association between brain metastasis and visceral metastasis. There was no association between age, race, and grade and having brain metastasis.

However, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-based PET imaging is more common worldwide, supported by international guidelines, and is now approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the USA for initial staging of primary prostate cancer. Little is known about the molecular profiles of lesions detected by PSMA-targeted PET/computed tomography (CT) versus 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT. We examined the expression of PSMA (FOLH1) and the fluciclovine transporter genes LAT1-4 and ASCT1/2 in a combined cohort of more than 18 000 radical prostatectomy specimens and their associations with clinical outcomes. Expression of PSMA and all but one fluciclovine transporter gene was higher in prostate cancer than in benign tissue. PSMA expression was associated with Gleason score (GS) ≥8 and lymph node involvement (LNI), and had a positive linear correlation with Decipher risk score. By contrast, expression of the fluciclovine transporters LAT2, LAT3, and ASCT2 was negatively associated with GS ≥ 8, LNI, and high Decipher score. The top decile of PSMA expression was associated with poorest metastasis-free survival (MFS), while the bottom deciles of LAT3 and ASCT2 expression were associated with poorest MFS. PATIENT SUMMARY: We measured the expression of genes that encode the targets for two different radiotracers in PET (positron emission tomography) scans of the prostate.

However, most alpha emitting radionuclides have long decay chains with long-lived daughter radionuclides. This leads to uncertainties in the dosimetry for normal organs and tissues, when established dosimetry models are employed. The aim of this project is to assign each progeny its own biokinetic behaviour. The novel dosimetry model was applied to 223Ra-dichloride, frequently used for the treatment of patients with metastatic bone disease from castration-resistant prostate cancer. In this dosimetry model, individual biokinetics for each daughter radionuclide was included. This resulted in a decrease in absorbed dose to bone surfaces and red marrow and increased absorbed dose to liver and kidney, when compared with dosimetry models assuming that the daughter nuclides follow the biokinetics of the parent radionuclide.""","""['M Andersson', 'A Kluge', 'T Meyer', 'E Koumarianou', 'S Mattsson']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Radiat Prot Dosimetry""","""['Dosimetry of bone metastases in targeted radionuclide therapy with alpha-emitting (223)Ra-dichloride.', 'A Phase 1, Open-Label Study of the Biodistribution, Pharmacokinetics, and Dosimetry of 223Ra-Dichloride in Patients with Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancer and Skeletal Metastases.', 'IDAC-Dose 2.1, an internal dosimetry program for diagnostic nuclear medicine based on the ICRP adult reference voxel phantoms.', 'Quantitative comparisons of cancer induction in humans by internally deposited radionuclides and external radiation.', 'Dosimetry in targeted alpha therapy.

Strategies to inactivate STAT3 are being pursued as potential anticancer therapies and have led to the identification of Stattic (6-nitrobenzo[b]thiophene-1,1-dioxide) as a ""specific"" STAT3 inhibitor that is often used to interrogate STAT3-mediated gene expression in vitro and in vivo. Here, we show that Stattic exerts many STAT3-independent effects on cancer cells, calling for reassessment of results previously ascribed to STAT3 functions. Studies of the STAT3-deficient prostate cancer cell line PC-3 (PC3) along with STAT3-proficient breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, SUM149) revealed that Stattic attenuated histone acetylation and neutralized effects of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor romidepsin. In PC3 cells, Stattic alone inhibited gene expression of CCL20 and CCL2, but activated expression of TNFA, CEBPD, SOX2, and MYC. In addition, we found that Stattic promoted autophagy and caused cell death. These data point to profound epigenetic effects of Stattic that are independent of its function as a STAT3 inhibitor.

Today, optical nanosensors have created an opportunity for diagnosis without sophisticated and expensive tools and the need for expertise; at the same time, they are highly sensitive and fast. An optical nano-genosensor was designed by conjugation of gold nanoparticles and a specific oligonucleotide (AuNPs-probe) from repeated DNA target for specific and sensitive polymerase chain reaction diagnosis of T. vaginalis gene sequence (L23861.1). The hybridization of AuNPs-probe was investigated with different concentrations of complementary sequence in synthesized target, gene sequence of standard T. vaginalis genomic DNA extraction, and PCR products of genomic DNA samples extracted from patients. Negative samples including synthesized non-complementary sequence, genomics DNA of other pathogens, and genomics DNA of healthy persons were considered for proof of the accuracy of the sensor function. The occurrence of correct hybridization was detected by adding acid to the medium and observing the changes in the color of the medium and spectroscopic spectrum. Based on spectrophotometric results, the fabricated genosensor had detection limits of 35.16 and 31 pg μL-1 for the detection of synthetic target and genomic DNA sequences, respectively. The results confirmed the correct function of genosensor for the detection of T. vaginalis in clinical samples.

Each dog underwent fluoroscopic prostatic artery catheterization. Yttrium-90 (90Y) microspheres (TheraSphere; Boston Scientific, Marlborough, Massachusetts) were delivered to 1 prostatic hemigland (dose escalation from 60 to 200 Gy), with the contralateral side serving as a control. Assessments for adverse events were performed throughout the follow-up (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0). Positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance (MR) imaging provided a confirmation after the delivery of absorbed-dose distribution. MR imaging was performed before and 3, 20, and 40 days after RE. Tissue harvest of the prostate, rectum, bladder, urethra, penis, and neurovascular bundles was performed 60 days after RE.  Results:   All the animals successfully underwent RE. Positron emission tomography/MR imaging demonstrated localization to and good coverage of only the treated hemigland. No adverse events occurred. The MR imaging showed a significant dose-dependent decrease in the treated hemigland size at 40 days (25%-60%, P < .001). No extraprostatic radiographic changes were observed. Necropsy demonstrated no gross rectal, urethral, penile, or bladder changes. Histology revealed RE-induced changes in the treated prostatic tissues of the highest dose group, with gland atrophy and focal necrosis. No extraprostatic RE-related histologic findings were observed.

Surgical procedure:   Surgery was performed using a da Vinci Xi system with adaptation for the primary treatment.  Measurements:   Perioperative outcomes included estimated blood loss (EBL), operative time (OT), intraoperative complications, and length of stay (LOS). Data for early and late postoperative complications were collected using the quality criteria recommended by the European Association of Urology. Univariate logistic regressions were performed to test the effect of baseline and perioperative characteristics on early postoperative complications.  Results and limitations:   The median age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index (ACCI) was 6 (IQR 5-7). The indication for RAC was hemorrhagic radiation cystitis in 29 cases (91%), contracted bladder in two cases (6.2%), and urinary fistula in one case (3.1%). The median EBL, OT, and LOS were 250 ml, 330 min, and 10 d, respectively. A total of 31 (97%) patients received an ileal conduit. The 90-d rate of Clavien-Dindo grade ≥IIIa complications was 28%. The late complication rate was 46% and the perioperative mortality rate was 0%. On univariate analyses, ACCI was the only parameter correlated with the risk of early complications (odds ratio 1.75, 95% confidence interval 1.05-2.9; p = 0.03). The median follow-up was 30 mo (IQR 15-40). The lack of comparison with open cystectomy represents the main limitation.  Conclusions:   RAC for UAEs in patients with a history of pelvic irradiation is a feasible option in high-volume centers. The use of new technologies can help to overcome some of the technical difficulties and reduce the risk of perioperative and late complications.  Patient summary:   We report our experience with robot-assisted surgery for removal of the bladder in the management of urinary problems after radiation therapy for prostate cancer. When performed by highly experienced surgeons, this is a feasible procedure with outcomes and early and late complication rates that are acceptable.""","""['Pietro Piazza', 'Giuseppe Rosiello', 'Victor Tames Chacon', 'Stefano Puliatti', 'Marco Amato', 'Rui Farinha', 'Riccardo Schiavina', 'Eugenio Brunocilla', 'Camille Berquin', 'Dries Develtere', 'Celine Sinatti', 'Hannah Van Puyvelde', 'Ruben De Groote', 'Peter Schatteman', 'Geert De Naeyer', ""Frederiek D'Hondt"", 'Alexandre Mottrie']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Analysis of intracorporeal compared with extracorporeal urinary diversion after robot-assisted radical cystectomy: results from the International Robotic Cystectomy Consortium.', 'In-depth Critical Analysis of Complications Following Robot-assisted Radical Cystectomy with Intracorporeal Urinary Diversion.', 'The Impact of Previous Prostate Surgery on Surgical Outcomes for Patients Treated with Robot-assisted Radical Cystectomy for Bladder Cancer.', 'Systematic review and cumulative analysis of perioperative outcomes and complications after robot-assisted radical cystectomy.', 'Utility of robot-assisted radical cystectomy with intracorporeal urinary diversion for muscle-invasive bladder cancer.']"""

This study aims to evaluate the utility of length of capsular contact (LCC ) in predicting the grade of EPE by correlating the measurements from MRI images and the measurements performed from radical prostatectomy specimens.  Materials and methods:   MR images and specimens of 110 tumors are analyzed retrospectively. The specimens are used as reference to validate the presence of EPE and to measure the ground truth LCC. MR images are evaluated by two radiologists to identify the presence of EPE and to predict the LCC indirectly. Reliability, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the evaluations are analyzed in comparison with the findings obtained from the specimens.  Results:   In detection of EPE existence, the radiologists achieve almost the same performance (all AUCs = 0.73) with optimal cut-off values lead to moderate sensitivity and specificity pairs (For cut-off = 15.8 mm; Se = 0.69, Sp = 0.68 and for cut-off of 14.5 mm: Se = 0.77, Sp = 0.62). In distinguishing high-grade EPE from low-grade EPE, the radiologists accomplish very similar performances (AUCs = 0.73 and 0.72) Optimal thresholds of 20.0 mm and 18.5 mm for the readers retrospectively reveal medium sensitivity and specificity pairs (Se = 0.64, Sp = 0.67; Se = 0.64, Sp = 0.67).

However, it is unclear how much of this variation could be attributed to patient, surgeon, institution, or socioeconomic-related factors and the impact of PSM on death among localized prostate cancer patients.  Methods:   This study aimed to assess the independent and relative contribution of the patient, surgeon, institution and area-level risk factors on geographic and temporal variation of PSM and evaluate the impact of PSM on five-year all-cause and prostate cancer-specific mortality among localized prostate cancer patients. Within the hierarchical-related regression approach, we utilised Bayesian spatial-temporal multi-level models to study individual and area-level predictors with the outcomes, while accounting for geographically structured and unstructured correlation and non-linear trends.  Results:   Individual-level data included 10,075 localized prostate cancer cases with RP reported to the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Registry Victoria between 2009 and 2018. Area-level data comprised socio-economic disadvantage and remoteness data at the local government area level in Victoria, Australia. 26 % of patients had PSM, and the rates varied across areas by years. This variation was mainly associated with NCCN risk, followed by RP techniques, surgical institution type, surgeon volume and socio-economic disadvantage. Intermediate (Odds ratio/OR = 1.21,95 % credible interval/Crl = 1.05-1.41), high/very-high risk groups (OR = 2.24,95 % Crl = 1.91-2.64) and public surgical institution (OR = 1.64, 95 % Crl = 1.46-1.84) were independently associated with a higher likelihood of PSM.

This study investigates the influence of mental and physical symptom distress on quality of life (QOL) among Black Americans with cancer and their family caregivers from a dyadic perspective.  Methods:   One hundred and fifty-one dyads comprised of a Black American with breast, colorectal, lung or prostate cancer and a Black family caregiver were included in this secondary analysis of pooled baseline data from three studies.

Results:   Fatigue, sleep problems, pain and mental distress were prevalent. Patients and caregivers reported similar levels of mental distress; however, patients reported higher physical distress. Increased patient mental distress was associated with decreased patient QOL (overall, emotional, social, functional). Increased patient physical distress was associated with decreased patient QOL (overall, physical, emotional, functional) and decreased caregiver emotional wellbeing. Increased caregiver mental distress was associated with decreased caregiver QOL (overall, emotional, social, functional) and decreased patient overall QOL.

Methods:   We used the Taiwan Cancer Registry Database to enroll cT1-4N0M0 prostate cancer patients who received definitive radiotherapy between 2011 and 2015. We used inverse probability treatment weighting (IPW) to construct balanced IGRT and non-IGRT groups. We compared the overall survival of those in the IGRT and non-IGRT groups. Supplementary analyses (SA) were performed with alternative covariates in propensity score (PS) models and PS approaches. The incidence rates of prostate cancer mortality (IPCM), other cancer mortality (IOCM), and cardiovascular mortality (ICVM) were also evaluated.  Results:   There were 360 patients in the IGRT arm and 476 patients in the non-IGRT arm. The median follow-up time was 50 months.

Conclusions:   The overall survival of localized prostate cancer patients who underwent IGRT was not inferior to those who did not.

Low urinary levels of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin have been associated with increased risk of advanced prostate cancer, but the relationship between pineal gland volume and composition and prostate cancer risk has not been examined.  Materials and methods:   We utilized data from 864 men from the AGES-Reykjavik Study with complete pineal gland volumes and urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin measurements. Pineal parenchyma, calcification, and cyst volumes were calculated from brain magnetic resonance imaging. Levels of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin were assayed from prediagnostic urine samples. We calculated Pearson correlation coefficients between parenchyma volume and urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to calculate multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) comparing prostate cancer risk across parenchyma volume tertiles and across categories factoring in parenchyma volume, gland composition, and urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin level.  Results:   Parenchyma volume was moderately correlated with urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin level (r = .24; p < .01). There was no statistically significant association between parenchyma volume tertile and prostate cancer risk. Men with high parenchyma volume, pineal cysts and calcifications, and low urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels had almost twice the risk of total prostate cancer as men with low parenchyma volume, no pineal calcifications or cysts, and low urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels (HR: 1.98; 95% CI: 1.02, 3.84; p: .04).

Methods:   The Hong Kong Urological Association and Hong Kong Society of Uro-oncology formed a joint discussion panel, which consisted of six urologists and six clinical oncologists with extensive experience in the public and private sectors. Following an evidence-based approach, the latest relevant publications were searched and reviewed, before proceeding to a structured discussion of relevant clinical issues.  Results:   The joint panel provided recommendations for PC management during the pandemic, in terms of general considerations, diagnostic procedures, different disease stages, treatment modules, patient support, and interdisciplinary collaboration. The overall goal was to minimize the risk of infection while avoiding unnecessary delays and compromises in management outcomes. Practical issues during the pandemic were addressed such as the use of invasive diagnostic procedures, robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy, hypofractionated radiotherapy, and prolonged androgen deprivation therapy. The recommendations were explicated in the context of Hong Kong, a highly populated international city, in relation to the latest international guidelines and evidence.

We evaluated primary granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) for preventing FN in Chinese patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive PC (mHSPC) and castration-resistant PC (mCRPC).  Patients and methods:   Data from two cohorts of 377 Chinese patients with mHSPC (100; 26.5%) and mCRPC (277; 73.5%) treated with docetaxel at six public oncology centres were analysed with multivariate regression. Primary GCSF prophylaxis was defined as administration within 5 days of starting docetaxel. The primary outcome was FN within 21 days of the first docetaxel cycle (1st FN).  Results:   Primary GCSF was given to 71 (18.8%) patients. FN occurred in 61 patients (16.2%) including 37 (9.8%) during the first cycle. Among patients who developed 1st cycle FN (n = 37) or not (n = 340), 2 and 69 received primary GCSF (5.4 vs. 20.3%, P = .03). Primary GCSF was associated with an overall reduced risk of 1st cycle FN (odds ratio [OR] = 0.22; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.05-0.96, P = .04), and similar trends were observed in the mHSPC (OR = 0.36, P = .35) and mCRPC (OR = 0.16, P = .08) subgroups. Poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (>1) was associated with an increased risk of 1st FN (OR = 3.90; 95% CI: 1.66-9.13, P = .002).  Conclusions:   To alleviate the risk of docetaxel-related FN, primary GCSF prophylaxis is suggested for Asian mCRPC and mHSPC patients, particularly those with poor performance status.""","""['Darren M C Poon', 'Kuen Chan', 'Tim-Wai Chan', 'Bryan Ng', 'Steven Siu', 'Joyce Ng', 'David Johnson', 'Ka Chai Lee;Hong Kong Society of Uro-Oncology (HKSUO)']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Asia Pac J Clin Oncol""","""['Does castration status affect docetaxel-related adverse events? :Identification of risk factors for docetaxel-related adverse events in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Risk of febrile neutropenia and early treatment cessation in men receiving standard and dose-reduced 3-weekly docetaxel for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Incidence, predictors, and outcomes of febrile neutropenia and neutropenia in patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer receiving docetaxel.', 'The risk of febrile neutropenia and need for G-CSF primary prophylaxis with the docetaxel and cyclophosphamide regimen in early-stage breast cancer patients: a meta-analysis.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of febrile neutropenia risk with TCH(P) in HER2-positive breast cancer.', 'Efficacy and safety of therapies for advanced prostate cancer in Asia: Evidence from a systematic literature review.', 'Ethnic Pharmacogenomic Differences in the Management of Asian Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate cancer management in the era of COVID-19: Recommendations from the Hong Kong Urological Association and Hong Kong Society of Uro-oncology.']"""

Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and the amount of DNA were investigated as tissue oxidative and toxic damage parameters. In Copenhagen rats, Dunning prostate cancer was induced using high metastatic MAT-Lylu cells and diabetes was induced by single dose of streptozotocin (STZ) injection. Metformin was administered for 14 days after diabetes and prostate cancer induced. The rats were divided into six groups as follows: control group, diabetic group (D), cancer group (C), diabetic + cancer (DC) group, cancer + metformin (CM) group, diabetic + cancer + metformin (DCM) group. At the end of the experiment, brains were removed. Significant decrease of brain boron levels and significant elevation of MPO activity and DNA levels were observed in D, C, and DC groups as compared to control group. The effect of diabetes induction on the brain boron levels was much more than prostate cancer induction. The administration of metformin with CM and DCM obviously declined MPO activity and increased brain boron levels almost near to control group level. In conclusion, this study shows that the protective effect of metformin against brain damage in STZ-induced diabetic rats with Dunning prostate cancer may also be related to increased boron levels. The boron levels may be a novel indicator of reduced toxic and oxidative stress. Furthermore, the distribution and mechanism of action of boron should be clarified.""","""['Armagan Begum Ozel', 'Eda Dagsuyu', 'Pınar Koroglu Aydın', 'Ilknur Bugan', 'Omur Karabulut Bulan', 'Refiye Yanardag', 'Aysen Yarat']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biol Trace Elem Res""","""[""Drug repurposing: Metformin's effect against liver tissue damage in diabetes and prostate cancer model."", 'Metformin protects against diabetes-induced heart injury and dunning prostate cancer model.', 'The protective effect of metformin against testicular damage in diabetes and prostate cancer model.', 'Histological and biochemical investigation of the renoprotective effects of metformin in diabetic and prostate cancer model.', 'Effect of coenzyme Q10 alone and its combination with metformin on streptozotocin-nicotinamide-induced diabetic nephropathy in rats.', 'Organoboronic acids/esters as effective drug and prodrug candidates in cancer treatments: challenge and hope.', ""Drug repurposing: Metformin's effect against liver tissue damage in diabetes and prostate cancer model."", 'Boron-Containing Compounds for Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Human Metabolic Disorders.']"""

Methods:   New drug authorizations for PCa from 2006 to 2020 were identified. The corresponding licensing trial publications were analyzed to check compliance with current FDA recommendations for race reporting. If race was unreported, the clinical trial report was analyzed to determine participant recruitment by race and lead the recruiting country.  Results:   During the study period, 17 new drug registrations for the management of PCa involving ten unique drugs were identified. In total, 18,455 participants were included in FDA registration trials, of which 76.3% were white or Caucasian, 7.9% Asian, 2.9% Black or African American, 0.5% American Indian or Alaskan Native, 0.1% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 1.8% other or multiple races and 10.5% unknown. 53% of trials reported race in the licensing publication, however of this only 55% met current FDA recommendations. When the race was unreported in the licensing publication, 88% of studies had further information in the clinical study report.  Conclusion:   We found a significant under-representation of non-white participants in FDA drug registration trials for PCa. Race reporting in licensing publication is inconsistent and both FDA and International Committee of Medical Journal Editors guidelines are not being universally followed.

Currently, NEPC diagnosis is challenging as available markers are not sufficiently specific. Our objective was to identify novel, extracellular vesicles (EV)-based biomarkers for diagnosing NEPC. Towards this, we performed small RNA next generation sequencing in serum EVs isolated from a cohort of CRPC patients with adenocarcinoma characteristics (CRPC-Adeno) vs CRPC-NE and identified significant dysregulation of 182 known and 4 novel miRNAs. We employed machine learning algorithms to develop an 'EV-miRNA classifier' that could robustly stratify 'CRPC-NE' from 'CRPC-Adeno'. Examination of protein repertoire of exosomes from NEPC cellular models by mass spectrometry identified thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) as a specific biomarker. In view of our results, we propose that a miRNA panel and TSP1 can be used as novel, non-invasive tools to identify NEPC and guide treatment decisions. In conclusion, our study identifies for the first time, novel non-invasive exosomal/extracellular vesicle based biomarkers for detecting neuroendocrine differentiation in advanced castration resistant prostate cancer patients with important translational implications in clinical management of these patients that is currently extremely challenging.""","""['Divya Bhagirath', 'Michael Liston', 'Theresa Akoto', 'Byron Lui', 'Barbara A Bensing', 'Ashok Sharma', 'Sharanjot Saini']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['MicroRNA determinants of neuroendocrine differentiation in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'BRN4 Is a Novel Driver of Neuroendocrine Differentiation in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer and Is Selectively Released in Extracellular Vesicles with BRN2.', 'Identification of Novel Diagnosis Biomarkers for Therapy-Related Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'The Crosstalk of Long Non-Coding RNA and MicroRNA in Castration-Resistant and Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer: Their Interaction and Clinical Importance.', 'Role of MicroRNAs in Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'Dynamic Role of Exosome microRNAs in Cancer Cell Signaling and Their Emerging Role as Noninvasive Biomarkers.', 'A Theranostic Small-Molecule Prodrug Conjugate for Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'Immunotherapy of Neuroendocrine Neoplasms: Any Role for the Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells?', 'Focus on the tumor microenvironment: A seedbed for neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Male Breast Metastasis: A Case of Treatment-Emergent Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.']"""

Objective:   To evaluate the impact of time from PB to HoLEP on perioperative outcomes.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 172 consecutive patients treated with HoLEP within 12 mo of a single previous transrectal PB at two tertiary centers were included.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Patients were stratified into two groups according to the median time from PB to HoLEP (namely, ≤6 and >6 mo). The primary outcome was intraoperative complications. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify the predictors of intraoperative complications. Linear regressions were used to test the association between the time from PB to HoLEP and intraoperative complications, enucleation efficiency, and enucleation time.  Results and limitations:   In total, 93 (54%) and 79 (46%) patients had PB ≤ 6 and >6 mo before HoLEP, respectively. Patients in PB ≤ 6 mo group experienced higher rates of intraoperative complications than those in PB > 6 mo group (14% vs 2.6%, p = 0.04). At multivariable analysis, time between PB and HoLEP was an independent predictor of intraoperative complications (odds ratio: 0.74; 95% confidence interval: 0.6-0.9; p = 0.006). Finally, the risk of intraoperative complications reduced by 1.5%, efficiency of enucleation increased by 4.1%, and enucleation time reduced by 1.7 min for each month passed from PB to HoLEP (all p ≤ 0.006).

Objective:   To evaluate the contributions of patient and treatment factors, surgeon efficiency metrics, and surgeon technical skill scores, especially for vesicourethral anastomosis (VUA), to models predicting urinary continence recovery following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).  Design, setting, and participants:   Automated performance metrics (APMs; instrument kinematics and system events) and patient data were collected for RARPs performed from July 2016 to December 2017. Robotic Anastomosis Competency Evaluation (RACE) scores during VUA were manually evaluated. Training datasets included: (1) patient factors; (2) summarized APMs (reported over RARP steps); (3) detailed APMs (reported over suturing phases of VUA); and (4) technical skills (RACE). Feature selection was used to compress the dimensionality of the inputs.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The study outcome was urinary continence recovery, defined as use of 0 or 1 safety pads per day. Two predictive models (Cox proportional hazards [CoxPH] and deep learning survival analysis [DeepSurv]) were used.  Results and limitations:   Of 115 patients undergoing RARP, 89 (77.4%) recovered their urinary continence and the median recovery time was 166 d (interquartile range [IQR] 82-337). VUAs were performed by 23 surgeons. The median RACE score was 28/30 (IQR 27-29). Among the individual datasets, technical skills (RACE) produced the best models (C index: CoxPH 0.695, DeepSurv: 0.708). Among summary APMs, posterior/anterior VUA yielded superior model performance over other RARP steps (C index 0.543-0.592). Among detailed APMs, metrics for needle driving yielded top-performing models (C index 0.614-0.655) over other suturing phases. DeepSurv models consistently outperformed CoxPH; both approaches performed best when provided with all the datasets. Limitations include feature selection, which may have excluded relevant information but prevented overfitting.  Conclusions:   Technical skills and ""needle driving"" APMs during VUA were most contributory. The best-performing model used synergistic data from all datasets.

There are increasing concerns regarding inequities in prostate cancer morbidity and mortality among the different ethnic groups in New Zealand. This study aims to assess ethnic differences in survival outcomes among men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   The analyzed cohort included 42,563 men, 40 years or older, diagnosed with prostate cancer from January 1st, 2000 to January 1st, 2016. Overall and cancer-specific survivals were estimated for the main ethnic groups in New Zealand namely: Māori (indigenous), Pacific, Asian, and European. Hazard ratio (HR) of death from prostate cancer was calculated with Fine-Gray competing risk regression, while adjusting for age, socioeconomic deprivation, year of cancer diagnosis, residential status, presence of urology service, and cancer grade at diagnosis.  Results:   Among all ethnic groups, Māori participants consistently had worst survival outcomes. At 15-year follow-up, the overall cumulative survival probabilities were 39.8%, 43.6%, 63.3%, and 46.5%, for Māori, Pacific, Asian and European men, respectively. In the same order, cancer-specific survivals were 62.7%, 64.3%, 79.8% and 72.0%. Māori men had 43% higher risk of dying from prostate cancer when compared to Europeans. This persisted following adjustments in the multivariable model (adjusted HR = 1.44, [95% CI: 1.29-1.61], P< 0.001). Conversely, differences in sociodemographic and cancer characteristics between Pacific and European men could explain the higher mortality risk in the former group (adjusted HR = 1.00, [95% CI: 0.84-1.19], P= 0.990).  Conclusions:   Significant ethnic disparities in prostate cancer survival outcomes are currently present in New Zealand. Several explanations have been proposed to account for this observation including differences in comorbidities, healthcare access and cancer grade at diagnosis.""","""['Bashar Matti', 'Kamran Zargar-Shoshtari']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Ethnic differences in prostate cancer survival in New Zealand: a national study.', 'Survival disparities between Māori and non-Māori men with prostate cancer in New Zealand.', 'Differences in survival between Māori and New Zealand Europeans with prostate cancer.', 'Ethnic and socio-economic disparities in prostate cancer screening: lessons from New Zealand.', 'Not in my hospital?

Lower HL is associated with poorer psychosocial health. However, there are no studies so far evaluating the impact of HL within oncological rehabilitation in Germany. Therefore, we explored HL in cancer patients in inpatient rehabilitation and its association with rehabilitation outcome.  Methods:   We conducted a secondary data analysis of a questionnaire survey with 449 cancer patients (breast, prostate, and colon cancer) at 3 measurement occasions (end of rehabilitation, 3- and 9 months follow-up). We assessed HL with the European Health Literacy Survey (HLS-EU-Q6). We evaluated rehabilitation outcomes by measuring fear of progression (FoP-Q-SF), need for psychosocial support, physical functioning and global quality of life (EORTC-QLQ-C30), and the work ability index (WAI). To explore the impact of HL on rehabilitation outcome, we used multiple regression analyses controlling for other factors.  Results:   At the end of rehabilitation, up to 56% of the patients reported difficulties in HL dimensions. Better HL was significantly associated with lower fear of progression (β=- 0,33) and need for psychosocial support (OR=0,28), higher physical functioning (β=0,22), higher global health status (β=0,23), and higher work ability (β=0,21). Longitudinal analyses showed that improvement in HL was significantly accompanied by improvements in all rehabilitation outcomes (0,18 ≤ β ≤ 0,24).  Conclusion:   HL is a relevant factor within cancer rehabilitation. More than half of the patients showed problematic HL at discharge. Furthermore, HL is a predictor of psychosocial, somatic, and work-related rehabilitation outcomes up to 9 months. Effective strategies to support patients in dealing with health information are essential and should be promoted within rehabilitation.""","""['Karin Meng', 'Verena Heß', 'Thomas Schulte', 'Hermann Faller', 'Michael Schuler']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Rehabilitation (Stuttg)""","""['Translation and cross-cultural adaptation of the European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire, HLS-EU-Q16: the Icelandic version.', 'Validity and measurement invariance across sex, age, and education level of the French short versions of the European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire.', 'Association of health literacy with short-term postoperative outcomes in older adult patients with abdominal tumors undergoing surgery and perioperative rehabilitation program: A prospective cohort study.', 'The EORTC QLQ-C30 Summary Score as Prognostic Factor for Survival of Patients with Cancer in the ""Real-World"": Results from the Population-Based PROFILES Registry.', 'Work-Related Health Literacy: A Scoping Review to Clarify the Concept.', 'Effectiveness and content components of nursing counselling interventions on self- and symptom management of patients in oncology rehabilitation-A systematic review.']"""

The research aims to evaluate the potential of stromal changes as a supplementary tool to predict the presence of higher grade carcinomas in the prostate using Masson's trichrome and Fanconi anemia complementation group M (FANCM) antibody stainings. 385 biopsies and corresponding radical prostatectomy specimens were analyzed to evaluate the rates of the diversity of ISUP grades. Of 128 upgraded prostatectomy cases, 82 were diagnosed with ISUP Gleason Grade 1 (GG1) in a biopsy. All 82 cancerous samples were stained with Masson's trichrome and FACNM antibody and compared with 82 samples without cancer to see if there was a difference in stromal composition. Additionally, 50 GG1 samples without the upgrade were stained to demonstrate if stromal changes can predict less differentiated carcinomas in the prostate. In FANCM stained samples, the average percentage of positively staining stroma over the total in non-upgraded GG1 biopsies was 36 % (13-59 %, SD = 11); 34 % (9-58, SD = 13) in samples from the upgraded cancerous group, and 44 % (22-69, SD = 11) in samples without cancer. In Masson's trichrome stained samples, with collagen quantified, the percentage in non-upgraded GG1 biopsies was 41 % (20-78 %, SD = 11); 44 % (23-89, SD = 15) in samples from upgraded cancerous group and 37 % (15-57, SD = 9) in samples without cancer. In both FANCM and Masson's trichrome, no statistical significance was found between upgraded and non-upgraded groups (p = 0.84 and p = 0.5, respectively), although some upgrades from GG1 to GG4 showed extreme values. The statistical significance was found in cancerous vs. benign samples with both FANCM (p < 0.01) and Masson's trichrome (p = 0.012).

Herein, we performed a meta-analysis aimed at systematically exploring the association between metastatic sites and AR-V7 expression in CRPC patients across prospective clinical trials.  Methods:   We retrieved all the relevant prospective clinical trials through PubMed/Medline, Cochrane library, and EMBASE; additionally, proceedings of the main international oncological meetings were also searched for relevant abstracts. Outcomes of interest included metastatic sites (lymph node metastases, any site metastases, visceral metastases, and bone metastases) in AR-V7 positive and AR-V7 negative CRPC patients. Odds Ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.  Results:   Overall, 14 eligible prospective studies involving a total of 1944 CRPC patients (AR-V7 positive: 467; AR-V7 negative: 1477) were included in the analysis. According to our results, no differences between AR-V7 positive and AR-V7 negative CRPC patients were observed in terms of lymph node (OR 1.01; 95 % CI 0.49-2.09) and visceral metastases (OR 1.23; 95 % CI 0.89-1.71). Conversely, AR-V7 positive CRPC patients presented higher rate of any site metastases (OR 2.22; 95 % CI 1.58-3.12) and bone metastases (OR 2.03; 95 % CI 1.42-2.9) compared to AR-V7 negative subjects.  Conclusions:   The results of this meta-analysis, the first in literature to be specifically focused on this topic so far, suggest that AR-V7 positivity may be associated with any site metastases and bone metastases; conversely, no association has been highlighted between AR-V7 expression and lymph node or visceral metastases. Although this meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution due to some limitations, our findings confirm that AR-V7 status could designate a unique and peculiar subtype of PC.

However, its biological role and associated mechanisms have not been addressed in PC progression.  Methods:   PMEPA1 mRNA expression and survival outcome of PC patients were evaluated via the GEPIA website. Lentiviral-mediated shRNA knockdown and ectopic expression of PMEPA1 were implemented in the pancreatic cancer cell line PANC1 cells. CCK-8 and colony formation assays were carried out to assess the biological function of PMEPA1 in PANC1 proliferation and viability. Dual-luciferase reporter assays and RT-qPCR were used to assess the interactive relationship between PMEPA1 and the MAPK signaling pathway.  Results:   By analyzing the data from GEPIA, we found that PMEPA1 mRNA expression is overexpressed in PC tissues compared with matched nontumor tissues. PMEPA1-high PC patients are predicted to have a worse prognosis than PMEPA1-low PC patients. We found that PMEPA1 shRNA suppressed PANC1 proliferation and colony formation capacity, while enforced expression of PMEPA1 yielded the opposite results. Mechanical investigations showed that PMEPA1 exerts its tumor-promoting function in pancreatic cancer via activation of the MAPK signaling pathway.  Conclusion:   PMEPA1 promotes the progression of PC at least partially by activating the MAPK signaling pathway; thus, the PMEPA1/MAPK axis may be a potential therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer.""","""['Mengqi Song', 'Bin Zhou', 'Bilu Li', 'Lantian Tian']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Am J Med Sci""","""['PMEPA1 facilitates non-small cell lung cancer progression via activating the JNK signaling pathway.', 'JTC801 Induces pH-dependent Death Specifically in Cancer Cells and Slows Growth of Tumors in Mice.', 'DUOX2 As a Potential Prognostic Marker which Promotes Cell Motility and Proliferation in Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Long noncoding RNA 00976 promotes pancreatic cancer progression through OTUD7B by sponging miR-137 involving EGFR/MAPK pathway.', 'PMEPA1 Gene Isoforms: A Potential Biomarker and Therapeutic Target in Prostate Cancer.', 'Deoxythymidylate kinase (DTYMK) participates in cell cycle arrest to promote pancreatic adenocarcinoma progression regulated by miR-491-5p through TP53 and is associated with tumor immune infiltration.', 'PMEPA1 Serves as a Prognostic Biomarker and Correlates with Immune Infiltrates in Cervical Cancer.']"""

This article looks into this, seeking relationships between cancer, age group, gender and population in the region of Lleida (Catalonia, Spain) using Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA).  Methods:   The dataset analysed was made up of 3408 cancer episodes between 2012 and 2014, extracted from the Population-based Cancer Registry (PCR) for Lleida province. The cancers studied were colon and rectal (1059 cases), lung (551 cases), urinary bladder (446 cases), prostate (609 cases) and breast (743 cases). The MCA technique was applied and used to search relationships among the main qualitative features. The basic statistics were the percentage explaining (variance), the inertia and the contribution of each qualitative variable.  Results:   General outcomes showed a low and moderate contribution of living in rural areas to colorectal and male prostate cancer. Males in urban areas were slightly and heavily affected by lung and urinary bladder cancer respectively. The analysis of each cancer provided additional information. Colorectal cancer greatly affected males aged <60, urban residents aged 70-79, and rural females aged ≥ 80. The impact of lung cancer was high among urban females <60, moderate among males aged 70-79 and high among rural females aged ≥ 80. The results for urinary bladder cancer results were similar to those for lung cancer. Prostate cancer affected both the <60 and ≥ 80 age groups significantly in rural areas. Breast cancer hit the 70-79 group significantly and, somewhat less so, rural females aged ≥ 80.  Conclusions:   MCA was a significant help for detecting the contributions of qualitative variables and the associations between them. MCA has proven to be an effective technique for analyzing the incidence of cancer. The outcomes obtained help to corroborate suspected trends, as well as detecting and stimulating new hypotheses about the risk factors associated with a specific area and cancer.

Methods:   A total of 24 out of 300 questions addressed staging, treatment, and follow-up for patients with mCSPC both in best-practice settings and resource-limited settings. Responses were compiled and presented in percentage of clinicians supporting each response. Questions had 4-8 options for response.  Results:   Recommendations for staging in mCSPC were split but there was consensus that chest x-ray, abdominal and pelvic computed tomography, and bone scan should be used where resources are limited. In both de novo and relapsed low-volume mCSPC, orchiectomy alone in limited resources was favored and in relapsed high-volume disease, androgen deprivation therapy plus docetaxel in limited resources and androgen deprivation therapy plus abiraterone in high-resource settings were consensus.

The panel recommended against the use of osteoclast-targeted therapy to prevent osseous complications. There was consensus that monitoring of patients undergoing systemic treatment should only be conducted in case of prostate-specific antigen elevation or progression-suggestive symptoms.

With a doubling time of more than 10 months, > 54% of experts recommended no treatment independent of life expectancy. More than half of the experts, regardless of resources, recommended follow-up with a physical examination and PSA levels every 3-6 months and imaging only in the case of symptoms.  Conclusion:   The voting results and recommendations presented in this document can be used by physicians to support management for biochemical recurrence of castration-resistant PCa in areas of limited resources.

Methods:   Four physicians retrospectively evaluated two matched cohorts of patients undergoing [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT on a digital (dPET/CT n = 65) or an analogue scanner (aPET/CT n = 65) for recurrent prostate cancer between 11/2018 and 03/2019. The number of equivocal and pathological lesions as well as the frequency of discrepant findings and the interrater reliability for the two scanners were compared.  Results:   dPET/CT detected more lesions than aPET/CT (p < 0.001). A higher number of pathological scans were observed for dPET/CT (83% vs. 57%, p < 0.001). The true-positive rate at follow-up was 100% for dPET/CT compared to 84% for aPET/CT (p < 0.001). The proportion of lesions rated as non-pathological as a total of all PSMA-avid lesions detected for dPET/CT was comparable to aPET/CT (61.8% vs. 57.0%, p = 0.99). Neither a higher rate of diagnostically uncertain lesions (11.5% dPET/CT vs. 13.7% aPET/CT, p = 0.95) nor discrepant scans (where one or more readers differed in opinion as to whether the scan is pathological) were observed (18% dPET/CT vs. 17% aPET/CT, p = 0.76). Interrater reliability for pathological lesions was excellent for both scanner types (Cronbach's α = 0.923 dPET/CT; α = 0.948 aPET/CT) and interrater agreement was substantial for dPET/CT (Krippendorf's α = 0.701) and almost perfect in aPET/CT (α = 0.802).  Conclusions:   A higher detection rate for pathological lesions for dPET/CT compared with aPET/CT in multiple readers was observed. This improved sensitivity was coupled with an improved true-positive rate and was not associated with increased diagnostic uncertainty, rate of non-specific lesions, or reduced interrater reliability.

Methods:   Patients who underwent TB with the 3D Navigo™ system in our center between June 2014 and May 2018 were prospectively included, excluding those who have previously received treatment for prostate cancer. A 3-Tesla MRI imaging was performed before biopsies; findings were reported according to the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2 (PIRADS). CSC was defined by an ISUP score ≥ 2.  Results:   304 patients underwent TB. Median age was 66 years (51-84). Median PSA was 7.75 ng/ml (0.6-70.0). Median prostate volume was 45.0 ml (15.9-221.7).

Abiraterone may have a role in additional aspects of prostate cancer treatment in the future.Areas covered: The present article focuses on the development and establishment of abiraterone among the available treatment options for prostate cancer. A literature search was performed in PubMed/Medline for prior studies and reviews of the drug. Current clinical trials were examined in the Clinicaltrials.gov database.Expert opinion: Abiraterone has shown efficacy in castrate-resistant metastatic prostate cancer, providing an additional degree of hormonal sensitivity for tumors resistant to ADT. Impressively, abiraterone in conjunction with ADT as a first-line treatment for castrate-sensitive prostate cancer also confers a significant overall survival benefit compared to ADT alone. With minimal additional toxicity, abiraterone has established itself as a well-tolerated, convenient, and effective treatment option.

Black men are at greatest risk of developing and dying of prostate cancer. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines recommend shared decision-making in consideration of screening for men ages 55 to 69 years. Currently, digital rectal examination alone is not recommended for prostate cancer screening. The serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test remains the most common screening tool. Novel formulas and algorithms, including the Prostate Health Index (phi) and the 4Kscore, which use total PSA, free PSA, and other information to estimate risk, have shown greater predictive values for detection than the PSA test. Risk assessment with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study with or without MRI/transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) targeted biopsy requires fewer biopsy specimens than traditional TRUS-guided biopsy, and is associated with higher detection rates.

This study evaluated PROGRESS, a web-based intervention designed to improve adaptive coping among PCa survivors.  Methods:   Localized PCa patients (N = 431) within one year of treatment completion were randomized to receive educational booklets or PROGRESS + educational booklets. Surveys completed at baseline, 1-, 3-, and 6-months assessed patient characteristics; functional quality of life and coping (primary outcomes); and psychosocial outcomes (e.g., self-efficacy, marital communication; secondary outcomes). Intent-to-treat and as-treated analyses were completed to assess change in outcomes from baseline to 6 months using linear mixed effects regression models.  Results:   In the intent-to-treat analyses, participants randomized to the intervention group had improved diversion coping (i.e., healthy redirection of worrying thoughts about their cancer), but more difficulties in marital communication (ps < 0.05). However, PROGRESS usage was low among those randomized to the intervention group (38.7%). The as-treated analyses found PROGRESS users reported fewer practical concerns but had worse positive coping compared to PROGRESS non-users (ps < 0.05).

One of the most critical performance metrics for validation of any assay is related to the minimum amount of values that can be detected and any value below this limit is referred to as below the limit of detection (LOD). Most of the existing approaches that model such biomarkers, restricted by LOD, are parametric in nature. These parametric models, however, heavily depend on the distributional assumptions, and can result in loss of precision under the model or the distributional misspecifications. Using an example from a prostate cancer clinical trial, we show how a critical relationship between serum androgen biomarker and a prognostic factor of overall survival is completely missed by the widely used parametric Tobit model. Motivated by this example, we implement a semiparametric approach, through a pseudo-value technique, that effectively captures the important relationship between the LOD restricted serum androgen and the prognostic factor.

Castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is often driven by constitutively active androgen receptor and commonly becomes resistant to established hormonal therapy strategies such as enzalutamide as a result. However, the role of KDM1B involved in next generation anti-enzalutamide resistance and the mechanisms of KDM1B regulation are poorly defined. Here, we show that KDM1B is upregulated and correlated with prostate cancer progression and poor prognosis. Downregulation of miR-215 is correlated with overexpression of KDM1B in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells, which promotes AR-dependent AGR2 transcription and regulates the sensitivity to next generation AR-targeted therapy. Inhibition of KDM1B significantly inhibits prostate tumor growth and improves enzalutamide treatments through AGR2 suppression.

The IL4 signaling axis has been characterized in various adult cancers as well; however, pediatric trials often follow similar adult trials and the role of the IL4Rα receptor has not been explored in the context of a mediator of metastasis in adult disease. Here, we demonstrate that the impact of IL4Rα blockade in an orthotopic allograft model of aRMS is not mediated by a macrophage response. We further examine the effect of IL4 blockade in adult colon, breast, and prostate cancers and find that inhibition of IL4Rα signaling modulates in vitro cell viability of HCT-116 colon carcinoma cells; however, this finding did not translate to an autocrine-related in vivo difference in tumor burden or lung metastasis.

The time to treatment failure (TTF) was 14.8, 18.2, and 20.6 months in these 3 patients, respectively. PSA nadir occurred after 14, 6 and 13 cycles, respectively. The OS was 21.6, 22.2 and 25.8 months, respectively. Anemia, lymphopenia, and neutropenia were the most common adverse events. NDLS treatment was overall well-tolerated without any new safety concerns.  Conclusions:   Biweekly NDLS for >20 cycles was effective and well-tolerated in patients with mCRPC. NDLS can potentially be used for long-term management, which may be a requirement for most patients with mCRPC.""","""['Srikant Tiwari', 'Abhaya Bisaria', 'Harmeet Kaur', 'Nisarg Joshi', 'Jaykumar Sejpal', 'Mujtaba A Khan']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Oncol Pharm Pract""","""['A Multicentric, Retrospective Efficacy and Safety Study of Nanosomal Docetaxel Lipid Suspension in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Biweekly Cabazitaxel Is a Safe Treatment Option for Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) Patients After Docetaxel - A Final Analysis of the Prosty II Trial.', 'Nanosomal Docetaxel Lipid Suspension-Based Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer: Results from a Multicenter Retrospective Study.', 'Efficacy and Safety of Nanosomal Docetaxel Lipid Suspension-Based Chemotherapy in Sarcoma: A Multicenter, Retrospective Study.', 'Efficacy and safety of nanosomal docetaxel lipid suspension based chemotherapy in gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.']"""

This study aimed to map EPIC tool to EuroQoL-5D-3L (EQ5D) to generate EQ5D health utilities.  Methods and materials:   This is a secondary analysis of a prospective, randomized non-inferiority clinical trial, conducted between 04/2006 and 12/2009 at cancer centers across the United States, Canada, and Switzerland. Eligible patients included men >18 years with a known diagnosis of low-risk PC. Patient HRQoL data were collected using EPIC and health utilities were obtained using EQ5D. Data were divided into an estimation sample (n = 765, 70%) and a validation sample (n = 327, 30%). The mapping algorithms that capture the relationship between the instruments were estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS), Tobit, and two-part models. Five-fold cross-validation (in-sample) was used to compare the predictive performance of the estimated models. Final models were selected based on root mean square error (RMSE).  Results:   A total of 565 patients in the estimation sample had complete information on both EPIC and EQ5D questionnaires at baseline. Mean observed EQ5D utility was 0.90±0.13 (range: 0.28-1) with 55% of patients in full health. OLS models outperformed their counterpart Tobit and two-part models for all pre-determined model specifications. The best model fit was: ""EQ5D utility = 0.248541 + 0.000748*(Urinary Function) + 0.001134*(Urinary Bother) + 0.000968*(Hormonal Function) + 0.004404*(Hormonal Bother)- 0.376487*(Zubrod) + 0.003562*(Urinary Function*Zubrod)""; RMSE was 0.10462.

Method:   Patients with painful widespread skeletal metastases documented on 99mTc-MDP bone scintigraphy were intravenously administered 37 MBq/kg of 177Lu-DOTMP. Visual analogue score (VAS), analgesic score, European Cooperative Group of Oncology (ECOG) and the European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 of all the patients were assessed at baseline and posttherapy follow-up. Adverse effects were graded according to NCI-CTCAE V 5.0.  Results:   Twenty-seven patients with painful widespread skeletal metastases (men 18; median age 61 years; range: 18-81) were studied for their responses as complete response, partial response, minimal response, no response and pain progression based on VAS and analgesic score. Overall response was seen in 77.8% of patients (complete, partial and minimal in 29.6, 33.3 and 14.8%, respectively) with significant improvement in median VAS and mean analgesic score at 2 months posttherapy from baseline (P < 0.001).

Here, we interrogate genomic data from thousands of clinical CaP specimens that reflect progression from treatment-naïve, to castration-recurrent, and in some cases, neuroendocrine CaP for alterations in cell cycle-associated and -regulated genes, which are central to cancer initiation and progression. We evaluate gene signatures previously curated to evaluate G1-S and G2-M phase transitions or to represent the cell cycle-dependent proteome. The resulting CaP (stage)-specific overview confirmed the presence of well-known driver alterations impacting, for instance, the genes encoding p53 and MYC, and uncovered novel previously unrecognized mutations that affect others such as the PKMYT1 and MTBP genes. The cancer dependency and drugability of representative genomically altered cell cycle determinants were verified also. Taken together, these analyses on hundreds of often less-characterized cell cycle regulators expand considerably the scope of genomic alterations associated with CaP cell proliferation and cell cycle and isolate such regulatory proteins as putative drivers of CaP treatment resistance and entirely novel therapeutic targets for CaP therapy.""","""['Salma Ben-Salem', 'Varadha Balaji Venkadakrishnan', 'Hannelore V Heemers']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Endocr Relat Cancer""","""['Novel insights in cell cycle dysregulation during prostate cancer progression.', 'Intratumoral and Intertumoral Genomic Heterogeneity of Multifocal Localized Prostate Cancer Impacts Molecular Classifications and Genomic Prognosticators.', 'Deregulated kinase action in prostate cancer: molecular basis and therapeutic implications.', 'Targeted next-generation sequencing of advanced prostate cancer identifies potential therapeutic targets and disease heterogeneity.', 'Genomic, pathological, and clinical heterogeneity as drivers of personalized medicine in prostate cancer.', ""Characterization of tumor microenvironment infiltration and therapeutic responses of cell cycle-related genes' signature in breast cancer.""]"""

The aim of this study was to assess patterns of disease detection, predictive factors and safety using [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT versus diagnostic CT in patients being considered for salvage radiotherapy with biochemical recurrence post prostatectomy.  Methods:   We conducted a prospective trial recruiting 100 patients with detectable PSA post prostatectomy (PSA 0.2-2.0 ng/mL) and referred for salvage radiotherapy from August 2018 to July 2020. All patients underwent a PSMA PET/CT using the [18F]DCFPyL tracer and a diagnostic CT. The detection rates of [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT vs diagnostic CT were compared and patterns of disease are reported. Clinical patient and tumour characteristics were analysed for predictive utility. Thirty-day post-scan safety is reported.  Results:   Of 100 patients recruited, 98 were suitable for analysis with a median PSA of 0.32 ng/mL. [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT was positive 46.4% and equivocal 5.2%, compared to 15.5% positivity for diagnostic CT. Local recurrence was detected on [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT in 28.5%, nodal disease in 27.5% and bony metastases in 6.1% of patients. Both ISUP grade group (p < 0.001) and pre-scan PSA (p = 0.029) were significant predictors of [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT positivity, and logistic regression generated probabilities combining the two showed improved prediction rates.

However, the role of tumor microenvironment is important in tumor generation and progression. The aim of this study is to build and validate a nomogram based on perilesional and intralesional radiomics features and clinical factors for csPCa. This is a retrospective study, which included 140 patients who underwent prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This study used 3.0T T2-weighted imaging, apparent diffusion coefficient maps (derived from diffusion-weighted images), and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. Region of interest (ROI)s were segmented by two radiologists. Intralesional and combined radiomics signatures were built based on radiomics features extracted from intralesional and the combination of radiomics features extracted from intralesional and perilesional volumes. Serum total prostate-specific antigen level and combined radiomics signature scores were used to construct a diagnostic nomogram. Intraclass correlation efficient analysis was used to test intra- and inter-rater agreement of radiomics features. Min-max scalar was used for normalization. One-way analysis of variance or the Mann-Whitney U-test was used for univariate analysis. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, accuracy, balanced accuracy, and F1-score were used to evaluate radiomics signatures and the nomogram. Also, the nomogram was evaluated using decision curve analysis in testing cohort. Delong test was used to compare area under the curves (AUCs). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. In testing cohort, AUC, accuracy, balanced accuracy, and F1-score of combined radiomics signature (0.94, 0.83, 0.80, and 0.87, respectively) were all higher than that of intralesional radiomics signature (0.90, 0.77, 0.74, and 0.83, respectively).

The necessary development of unexplored therapeutic options relies on a deeper knowledge of molecular mechanisms leading to cancer progression. Redox signals are known to modulate the intensity and duration of oncogenic circuits; cues originating from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and downstream exocytic organelles are relevant in secretory tumors, including PCa. Ero 1α is a master regulator of redox homeostasis and oxidative folding.  Methods:   We assessed Ero 1α mRNA expression by bioinformatic analysis of three public datasets and protein expression levels in PCa cell lines representing different degrees of tumor progression and different human prostate specimens. Transient Ero 1α knockdown was achieved by RNA interference (siRNA). Consequences of Ero 1α downregulation were monitored by PCa proliferation, migration and invasion properties.  Results:   Ero 1α mRNA and protein levels are upregulated in PCa cell lines compared to non-tumorigenic cells (P=0.0273). Ero 1α expression increases with the grade of malignancy, reaching the highest level in the androgen resistant PC3. In patients' samples from 3 datasets, Ero 1α mRNA expression correlates with pathological Gleason scores. Ero 1α knockdown inhibits proliferation (P=0.0081), migration (P=0.0085) and invasion (P=0.0007) of PC3 cells and alters the levels of integrin β1 (P=0.0024).  Conclusions:   Results indicate that Ero 1α levels correlate with PCa aggressiveness; Ero 1α silencing inhibits key steps over the PCa metastatic process. Therefore, Ero 1α has the potential to be exploited as a novel biomarker and a therapeutic target in PCa.""","""['Julian Cornelius', 'Ilaria Cavarretta', 'Edoardo Pozzi', 'Giovanni Lavorgna', 'Irene Locatelli', 'Tiziana Tempio', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Agostino Mattei', 'Roberto Sitia', 'Andrea Salonia', 'Tiziana Anelli']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Transl Androl Urol""","""['Inhibition of proliferation, invasion, and migration of prostate cancer cells by downregulating elongation factor-1alpha expression.', 'CXCR4 pharmacogical inhibition reduces bone and soft tissue metastatic burden by affecting tumor growth and tumorigenic potential in prostate cancer preclinical models.', 'MicroRNA-101 negatively regulates Ezh2 and its expression is modulated by androgen receptor and HIF-1alpha/HIF-1beta.', 'MEN1 silencing aggravates tumorigenic potential of AR-independent prostate cancer cells through nuclear translocation and activation of JunD and β-catenin.', 'Increased Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Human Glaucomatous Trabecular Meshwork Cells and Tissues.', 'Endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductin 1-alpha deficiency and activation of protein translation synergistically impair breast tumour resilience.']"""

We show that specific small RNAs downregulate expression of multiple essential and androgen receptor-coregulatory genes, leading to potent androgen signaling inhibition and PCa cell death. Expression of different short hairpin/small interfering RNAs (sh-/siRNAs) designed to target TMEFF2 preferentially reduce viability of PCa but not benign cells, and growth of murine xenografts. Surprisingly, this effect is independent of TMEFF2 expression. Transcriptomic and sh/siRNA seed sequence studies indicate that expression of these toxic shRNAs lead to downregulation of androgen receptor-coregulatory and essential genes through mRNA 3' UTR sequence complementarity to the seed sequence of the toxic shRNAs. These findings reveal a form of the ""death induced by survival gene elimination"" mechanism in PCa cells that mainly targets AR signaling, and that we have termed androgen network death induced by survival gene elimination (AN-DISE).

Recent evidence have shown that obesity, insulin resistance, or metabolic disturbances can be associated with changes in the gut microbiome, while animal studies also show that castration is associated with changes in the gut microbiome. This study aims to investigate whether the fecal microbiota in prostate cancer patients who had undergone prostatectomy or ADT are different, and explore changes in phylogeny and pathways that may lead to side effects from ADT.  Methods:   A total of 86 prostate cancer patients (56 patients on ADT and 30 patients with prostatectomy) were recruited. The fecal microbiota was analyzed by the 16S rRNA gene for alpha- and beta-diversities by QIIME2, as well as the predicted metabolic pathways by Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States 2.  Results:   The alpha-diversity was significantly lower in the ADT group. The beta-diversity was significantly different between the groups, in which Ruminococcus gnavus and Bacteroides spp were having higher relative abundance in the ADT group, whereas Lachnospira and Roseburia were reduced. The Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio is noted to be lower in the ADT group as well. The functional pathway prediction showed that the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin) and propanoate was enriched in the ADT as well as the energy cycle pathways. This study is limited by the cross-sectional design and the clinical heterogeneity.  Conclusions:   There is a significant difference in gut microbiome between prostate cancer patients on ADT and prostatectomy. We theorize that this difference may contribute to the development of metabolic complications from ADT.

However, nearly all patients develop resistance. We designed a phase II multicenter study of enzalutamide in metastatic CRPC incorporating tissue and blood biomarkers to dissect mechanisms driving resistance.  Patients and methods:   Eligible patients with metastatic CRPC underwent a baseline metastasis biopsy and then initiated enzalutamide 160 mg daily. A repeat metastasis biopsy was obtained at radiographic progression from the same site when possible. Blood for circulating tumor cell (CTC) analysis was collected at baseline and progression. The primary objective was to analyze mechanisms of resistance in serial biopsies. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on tissue biopsies. CTC samples underwent RNA sequencing.  Results:   A total of 65 patients initiated treatment, of whom 22 (33.8%) had received prior abiraterone. Baseline biopsies were enriched for alterations in AR (mutations, amplifications) and tumor suppression genes (PTEN, RB1, and TP53), which were observed in 73.1% and 92.3% of baseline biopsies, respectively. Progression biopsies revealed increased AR amplifications (64.7% at progression vs. 53.9% at baseline) and BRCA2 alterations (64.7% at progression vs. 38.5% at baseline). Genomic analysis of baseline and progression CTC samples demonstrated increased AR splice variants, AR-regulated genes, and neuroendocrine markers at progression.  Conclusions:   Our results demonstrate that a large proportion of enzalutamide-treated patients have baseline and progression alterations in the AR pathway and tumor suppressor genes.

Methods:   We tabulated prostate-specific antigen (PSA), cT stage, age, and SRP rates across individual SEER registries. Kaplan-Meier and competing risks regression methodologies depicted cancer-specific mortality and other cause mortality. Finally, overall mortality was compared with predicted life expectancy.  Results:   Overall, 428 SRP patients (2004-2016) were identified in the SEER database. Median follow-up duration was 74 months (interquartile range [IQR], 31-114). The median age at diagnosis was 68 years (IQR, 61-73 years) with a median PSA at diagnosis of 8.8 ng/mL (IQR, 5.4-18.6 ng/mL) and 10% cT3-4 stage (0%-23.8%). Variability existed across individual SEER registries regarding age, PSA, cT stage, and annual number of SRPs (0-17), as well as cumulative numbers of SRPs (7-73) between 2004 and 2016. At 10 years, cancer-specific mortality was 23.2% vs. other cause mortality 19.3%. Finally, SRP patients exhibited higher 10-year overall mortality (43.3%) than predicted by life tables (31.8%).  Conclusion:   SRP is rarely performed. In most SEER registries, SRP use is very occasional. More than 2 average annual SRPs were reported in only 5 of all registries. Nonetheless, across all registries, SRP patients showed marginal to moderate differences in PSA, cT stage, and age at diagnosis.

Patients and methods:   This multi-center, retrospective study included patients with hormone-sensitive biological relapse after local treatment with curative intent and with fewer than six choline PET/CT metastases. The primary endpoint was biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS). Risk groups were based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≥ 0.8 ng/mL and metastatic sites at OM cancer diagnosis.  Results:   Between October 2012 and December 2016, 177 patients were included, with a median follow-up of 49.02 months. The median bRFS was 39.74 months. In multivariate analyses, bone metastases and PSA ≥ 0.8 ng/mL were associated with worse bRFS. Four risk groups (I to IV; hazard ratio [HR], 5.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.32-26.61) were observed, with median bRFS not reached for group I (PSA < 0.8 ng/mL; node metastasis [M1a]), a 40.00-month bRFS for group II (PSA ≥ 0.8 ng/mL; M1a), 29.97-month bRFS for group III (bone metastasis [M1b], whatever the PSA level); and 22.70-month bRFS for group IV (PSA > 0.8 ng/mL and visceral metastasis [M1c]).

Methods:   We analyzed 40 patients with PCA who received 16- or 12-fraction CIRT at our center. Linear-quadratic (LQ) and RBE-conversion models were employed to convert the constraints into various fractionations and biophysical models. Based on them, the MKM LQ strategy converted MKM rectum constraints for 16-fraction CIRT to 12-, 8-, and 4-fraction CIRT using the LQ model. Then, MKM constraints were converted to LEM using the RBE-conversion model. Meanwhile the LEM LQ strategy converted MKM rectum constraints for 16-fraction CIRT to LEM using the RBE-conversion model. Then, LEM constraints were converted from 16-fraction constraints to the rectum constraints for 12-, 8-, and 4-fraction CIRT using the LQ model. The LEM constraints for 16- and 12-fraction CIRT were evaluated using rectum doses and clinical follow-up. To adapt them for the MKM LQ strategy, CNAO LEM constraints were first converted to MKM constraints using the RBE-conversion model.  Results:   The NIRS (i.e. DMKM|v, V-20%, 10%, 5%, and 0%) and CNAO rectum constraints (i.e. DLEM|v, V-10 cc, 5 cc, and 1 cc) were converted for 12-fraction CIRT using the MKM LQ strategy to LEM 37.60, 49.74, 55.27, and 58.01 Gy (RBE), and 45.97, 51.70, and 55.97 Gy (RBE), and using the LEM LQ strategy to 39.55, 53.08, 58.91, and 61.73 Gy (RBE), and 49.14, 55.30, and 59.69 Gy (RBE). We also established LEM constraints for 8- and 4-fraction CIRT. The 10-patient RBE-conversion model was comparable to 30-patient model. Eight patients who received 16-fraction CIRT exceeded the corresponding rectum constraints; the others were within the constraints. After a median follow-up of 10.8 months (7.1-20.8), No ≥ G1 late rectum toxicities were observed.

However, defining its role in the clinical space is still debated, especially with regards to identifying eligible candidates who will stand to benefit from treatment. Active surveillance (AS) is established as the preferred treatment for low-risk prostate cancer, with the goal of identifying those experiencing risk re-classification for curative intervention if it occurs. AS has been shown to be inferior to whole-gland treatments in to preventing progression or metastases. As a result, the field has sought solutions outside of the dichotomous options currently presented to men with low-risk cancer. Finally, the acceptance of preservation of sexual/urinary function and the avoidance of definitive therapy as valid endpoints has forced providers to think outside of survival alone as meaningful measures of success. It is here that focal therapy has emerged as a prospective replacement to AS or definitive treatment in carefully selected men. Combined with available risk stratification tools, focal ablation may afford patients durable oncological benefit while maintaining quality of life even in low-risk cancers.""","""['Joel Berends', 'Ajith Dupati', 'John Dibianco', 'Arvin K George']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Ablation of Low-Risk Prostate Cancer: Both Sides of the Story.', 'Active monitoring, radical prostatectomy and radical radiotherapy in PSA-detected clinically localised prostate cancer: the ProtecT three-arm RCT.', 'Comparisons of Oncological and Functional Outcomes Between Primary Whole-Gland Cryoablation and High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Association Between Radiation Therapy, Surgery, or Observation for Localized Prostate Cancer and Patient-Reported Outcomes After 3 Years.', 'Contemporary results of focal therapy for prostate cancer using cryoablation.', 'Focal cryoablation of prostate: a review.', 'Real-Time and Delayed Imaging of Tissue and Effects of Prostate Tissue Ablation.', 'Ablation of Low-Risk Prostate Cancer: Both Sides of the Story.']"""

The most relevant risk factors reported are prolonged surgical duration and prostatic volume. The purpose of this study is to analyze risk factors associated with the development of U/BNS following TURP. Materials and Methods: Case-control study. Population: patients who underwent TURP. Cases: patients with U/BNS following TURP, diagnosed between January 2010 and December 2018. We included patients with obstructive symptoms after TURP with clinical or radiographical evidence of U/BNS. Controls were patients who underwent TURP between January 2016 and December 2017, without evidence of stricture. Patients with history of pelvic fracture and previous U/BNS were excluded. We analyzed as risk factors age, prostatic volume, diabetes mellitus, previous use of transurethral catheter, urinary tract infection, bladder calculi, prostate cancer, previous TURP, resection time, resected volume during TURP, transoperative complications, and number of surgical procedures performed during the same event. We used chi-square or Mann-Whitney's U test for between-group comparison; association was established by odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (CI), variables with p < 0.05 were included in the logistic regression. Results: We included 101 cases and 207 controls. Cases had lower incidence of prostate cancer, smaller prostates, less resection time during TURP, lower grams resected and prostate-specific antigen values than controls. History of transurethral catheter was more frequent in controls than cases (46% vs 29%, p = 0.004); there were no differences between groups in the other factors analyzed. On multivariate analysis, the use of a transurethral catheter was a protective factor against U/BNS (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.064-0.442, p < 0.001). Conclusions: In this study, the use of urethral catheter before TURP is a protective factor against U/BNS.""","""['María Esther Garza-Montúfar', 'Héctor Cobos-Aguilar', 'Joaquín Darío Treviño-Baez', 'Patricia Pérez-Cortéz']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Risk factors for urethral stricture and/or bladder neck contracture after monopolar transurethral resection of the prostate for benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Incidence of urethral stricture after bipolar transurethral resection of the prostate using TURis: results from a randomised trial.', 'Bladder neck stenosis after transurethral prostate surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Transurethral resection of the prostate stricture management.', 'Bipolar transurethral resection versus monopolar transurethral resection for benign prostatic hypertrophy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Update on the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia and the role of minimally invasive procedures.']"""

Materials and methods:   Using a prospectively maintained database of men who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) (2010- 2018), candidates for AS were identified according to the expanded criteria. Pathological upgrading was defined as a pathologic Gleason score (pGS) of 3+4 or higher for patients with a biopsy GS of 3+3 and a pGS of 4+3 or higher for patients with a biopsy GS of 3+4. Major upgrading was defined as a pGS of 4+4 or higher. The ₓ2 test was used for comparisons.  Results:   Of 1,320 men who were candidates for AS, 288 (21.8%) had a family history of prostate cancer. There were no differences in terms of the age, number of positive cores, or number of patients with a GS of 7 between the two groups. Pathological upgrading was observed in 61.1% of the total cohort, with no difference observed between the two groups (60.7% versus 62.5%; p = 0.5).

[68Ga]Ga-P16-093 is a PSMA-targeting agent for positron emission tomography imaging, currently under a Phase 2 clinical trial. In the present study, P16-093 was labeled with 18F via [18F]AlF2+ complex formation, and the biological properties of [18F]AlF-P16-093 were evaluated. Optimization of radiolabeling efficiency was performed by testing a series of parameters, including the amount of free ligand; the amount of Al3+; and the influence of solvent, pH, temperature, reaction time, and reaction volume. Optimal labeling results were achieved at pH 5 by reacting at 60 °C for 15 min in a vial containing 74-370 MBq of [18F]fluoride, 46 nmol of P16-093, 40 nmol of AlCl3·6 H2O, and 50% EtOH. [18F]AlF-P16-093 was prepared with a non-decay-corrected radiochemical yield of 54.4 ± 4.4% (n = 9) within 30 min (final radiochemical purity ≥95%). In vitro, [18F]AlF-P16-093 showed PSMA-specific high uptakes in PIP-PC3 cells. The binding affinity of [18F]AlF-P16-093 to PSMA was determined as Kd of 12.4 ± 2.0 nM. The tumor uptake in mice with a xenografted PSMA-expressing PIP-PC3 tumor was high (18.8 ± 5.14% ID/g at 1 h postinjection) and retained without washout for 2 h. In addition, tumor uptake was almost completely blocked by coinjecting a PSMA inhibitor, 2-PMPA. The bone activity at 1 h post injection was higher with [18F]AlF-P16-093 (2.83 ± 0.49% ID/g) in comparison to that of [68Ga]Ga-P16-093 (0.26 ± 0.07% ID/g). In summary, an efficient and simple radiosynthesis of [18F]AlF-P16-093 was achieved.

MATERIAL AND METHODS SPOP knockout C4-2 cells (C4-2 SPOP-/-) were verified by western blotting. Transwell and wound-healing assays were applied to verify different migration and invasion abilities between the C4-2 SPOP-/- and control cells. We used an antibody array to find different soluble chemokine factors in the C4-2 SPOP-/- cells. ELISA and qRT-PCR were applied for confirmation. To test MCP-1 function in conditioned medium, a transwell assay was applied with or without anti-MCP-1 antibody. RESULTS The western blot showed that SPOP was knocked out in sgSPOP-1 and sgSPOP-2 (different clones of C4-2 SPOP-/-). The transwell and wound-healing assays indicated that, compared with control cells, sgSPOP-1 and sgSPOP-2 had stronger migration and invasion abilities. The antibody array found that the expression of MCP-1 was upregulated in sgSPOP-1 and sgSPOP-2 conditioned medium. This result was verified by ELISA and qRT-PCR. In the prostate cancer cells, migration and invasion activity was greatly increased in C4-2 SPOP-/- conditioned medium, while this activity was decreased after anti-MCP-1 antibody neutralization. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that the loss of SPOP in C4-2 cells promotes increased cell migration and invasion abilities. This may be realized by upregulating the expression of MCP-1. The inhibition of MCP-1 expression may be an effective treatment for SPOP-mutant prostate cancer.""","""['Junlin Shi', 'Ji Cao', 'Xiaomei Lu', 'Langlin Fan', 'Hongwei Guo', 'Jiejun Fu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Sci Monit""","""['Speckle-type POZ protein up-regulates c-Jun protein expression and promotes proliferation and invasion of renal carcinoma cells.', 'Dysregulation of INF2-mediated mitochondrial fission in SPOP-mutated prostate cancer.', 'SPOP promotes ATF2 ubiquitination and degradation to suppress prostate cancer progression.', 'The emerging role of speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) in cancer development.', 'The emerging role of SPOP protein in tumorigenesis and cancer therapy.']"""

Materials and methods:   We queried the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System, a retrospective, pharmacovigilance database, for cardiovascular adverse event reports in men with prostate cancer receiving gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, GnRH antagonists, androgen receptor antagonists, and/or androgen synthesis inhibitors from January 2000 to April 2020.  Results:   Cardiovascular adverse events accounted for 6,231 reports (12.6%) on hormone monotherapy and 1,793 reports (26.1%) on combination therapy. Arterial vascular events were reported most commonly, followed by arrhythmias, heart failure, and venous thromboembolism. Compared to GnRH agonists, GnRH antagonists were associated with fewer cardiovascular adverse event reports as monotherapy (adjusted reporting odds ratio [ROR]=0.70 [95% CI 0.59-0.84], p <0.001) and as combination therapy (ROR=0.47 [0.34-0.67], p <0.0001), driven by reductions in arterial vascular events. Second generation androgen receptor antagonists and abiraterone were associated with more reports of hypertension requiring hospitalization (ROR=1.21 [1.03-1.41], p=0.02 and ROR=1.19 [1.01-1.40], p=0.03, respectively), and more heart failure events when used in combination with GnRH antagonists (ROR=2.79 [1.30-6.01], p=0.009 and ROR=2.57 [1.12-5.86], p=0.03).  Conclusions:   In this retrospective analysis of a pharmacovigilance database, arterial vascular events were the most commonly reported cardiovascular adverse events in men on hormone therapy for prostate cancer. GnRH antagonists were associated with fewer reports of overall cardiovascular events and arterial vascular events than GnRH agonists.

Here, a novel biocompatible melanin nanoprobe (PMNs-II-813) coupled with a highly specific prostate-specific membrane antigen small molecule inhibitor is developed for the targeted multimodal diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. The melanin nanoparticles demonstrate photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy (PTT) functionalities via strong near-infrared absorption.

Fusion PET/MRI with PMNs-II-813 enables the monitoring of treatment effects in real time and lasts for more than 1 week, demonstrating the capability for multimodal theranostics in prostate cancer. Labeling with a therapeutic radionuclide, 131 I, simultaneously endows the nanoprobe with the capability for radioisotope therapy (RIT) and PTT under triple-modal imaging guidance. Combined PTT and RIT has an inhibitory effect on prostate cancer growth (tumor inhibition rate of ≈93% 20 days after treatment), which is significantly better than that with the single treatment.

We investigated the androgen-responsive transcriptome in human and mouse granulosa cells (GCs) and surprisingly found that the gene-regulation activity of androgen receptor (AR) in these cells is negligible. We then investigated extranuclear actions of AR and found that in human and mouse GCs, as well as in prostate cancer cells, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) dramatically increases the half-life of its own receptor protein. Using the human granulosa-like KGN cells, we show that this effect is not the result of increased AR gene transcription or protein synthesis, nor is it fully abrogated by proteasome inhibition. Knockdown of PTEN, which contributes to degradation of cytoplasmic AR, did not diminish AR accumulation in the presence of DHT. Using immunofluorescence cellular localization studies, we show that nuclear AR is selectively protected from degradation in the presence of DHT. Knockdown of importin 7 expression, a potential regulator of AR nuclear import, does not affect DHT-mediated nuclear accumulation of AR, suggesting importin 7-independent nuclear import of AR in GCs. Further, DNA binding is not required for this protective mechanism. In summary, we show that ligand binding sequesters AR in the nucleus through enhanced nuclear localization independent of DNA binding, thereby protecting it from proteasome degradation in the cytoplasm. This phenomenon distinguishes AR from other sex steroid receptors and may have physiological significance through a positive feedback loop in which androgen induces its own activity in male and female reproductive tissues.""","""['Olga Astapova', 'Christina Seger', 'Stephen R Hammes']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Endocr Soc""","""['Androgen-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptotic death in PC-3 prostatic cell cultures expressing a full-length human androgen receptor.', 'Androgen induces a switch from cytoplasmic retention to nuclear import of the androgen receptor.', ""Characterization of nuclear import of the domain-specific androgen receptor in association with the importin alpha/beta and Ran-guanosine 5'-triphosphate systems."", 'Prolactin influences upon androgen action in male accessory sex organs.', 'Molecular mechanisms of androgen action.', 'Mechanisms and targeting of proteosome-dependent androgen receptor degradation in prostate cancer.', 'Androgens improve ovarian follicle function impaired by glucocorticoids through an androgen-IGF1-FSH synergistic effect.', ""A cryptic transactivation domain of EZH2 binds AR and AR's splice variant, promoting oncogene activation and tumorous transformation.""]"""

Through transient transfection of siRNA, the impacts of circSLC8A1 on PCa were discussed. Cell cycle evaluation, transwell assay, and CCK-8 assay were employed to determine its biological influences.  Results:   In this study, our data revealed that circSLC8A1 was downregulated in PCa tissues and cells. The reduction of circSLC8A1 resulted in the inhibition of cell proliferation and migration. In mechanism, circSLC8A1 exhibited a direct interaction with miR-21 and displayed as a miRNA sponge to inhibit PCa progression. The functional analysis revealed that the circSLC8A1/miR-21 axis may regulate the cell proliferation, angiogenesis, cell migration, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, MAPK signaling pathway, and chemokine signaling pathway.  Conclusions:   CircSLC8A1 functioned as an inhibitor of neoplasm via modulating the miR-21 and might serve as a prospective target for the treatment of PCa.""","""['Daoyuan Wang', 'Shuxian Yan', 'Lihui Wang', 'Yunlong Li', 'Baoping Qiao']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Biomed Res Int""","""['Circular RNA circSLC8A1 inhibits the proliferation and invasion of glioma cells through targeting the miR-214-5p/CDC27 axis.', 'Circular RNA circSLC8A1 acts as a sponge of miR-130b/miR-494 in suppressing bladder cancer progression via regulating PTEN.', 'CircSMARCA5 Facilitates the Progression of Prostate Cancer Through miR-432/PDCD10 Axis.', 'Circular RNA circRNA_0082835 promotes progression and lymphatic metastasis of primary melanoma by sponging microRNA miRNA-429.', 'circCRKL suppresses the progression of prostate cancer cells by regulating the miR-141/KLF5 axis.', 'CircRNA-Associated CeRNAs Regulatory Axes in Retinoblastoma: A Systematic Scoping Review.', 'Integrated Analysis of the CircRNA-Based ceRNA Network in Renal Fibrosis Induced by Ischemia Reperfusion Injury.', 'Circular RNA circSLC8A1 inhibits the proliferation and invasion of glioma cells through targeting the miR-214-5p/CDC27 axis.', 'The Role and Clinical Potentials of Circular RNAs in Prostate Cancer.', 'CircNCX1: the ""Lord of the Ring"" in the Heart - Insight into Its Sequence Characteristic, Expression, Molecular Mechanisms, and Clinical Application.']"""

Methods:   Seventy ADT-treated men were randomized to exercise plus supplementation (Ex + Suppl; n = 34) or usual care (control; n = 36). Ex + Suppl involved thrice weekly progressive resistance training plus weight-bearing impact exercise with daily multinutrient supplementation. Primary outcomes were DXA hip and spine areal BMD. Secondary outcomes included the following: tibia and radius pQCT volumetric BMD, bone structure and strength, DXA body composition, pQCT muscle and fat cross-sectional area and muscle density, and muscle strength and physical function.  Results:   Sixty men (86%) completed the study. Mean exercise and supplement adherence were 56% and 77%, respectively. There were no effects of the intervention on bone or body composition outcomes.

Ciprofloxacin enables the inhabitation of the development of prostate cancer. In this regard, we plan to improve the anticancer effect of ciprofloxacin using the anionic G2 dendrimer in conjunction with ciprofloxacin. In the current study, we measured the size and the zeta potential as well as LC Mass to prove the fact that the conjugation was synthesized correctly. The anticancer activity among three groups including Ciprofloxacin, Ciprofloxacin -G2 dendrimer, and control was measured in vitro. In vitro studies showed that G2 anionic linear-globular polyethylene-glycol-based dendrimer, which conjugated to ciprofloxacin, was able to significantly improve the treatment efficacy over clinical ciprofloxacin alone with respect to proliferation assay. Maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated as 200 μ/mL for ciprofloxacin alone and 30μ/mL for ciprofloxacin-G2 dendrimer. In addition, the growth of DU-145 cancerous cells was inhibited by ciprofloxacin-G2 dendrimer conjugate and the number of apoptotic and necrotic cells was increased significantly as evaluated by an annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate assay.

Post-implant evaluation for quality assurance is usually performed using Computed Tomography (CT). Registration of the CT images with MRI reduces subjectivity in contouring by improving prostate edge detection. We hypothesized that a set of TRUS images post procedure may provide the same benefit. MATERIAL/METHODS Consecutive patients undergoing Low-Dose-Rate prostate brachytherapy were recruited. TRUS images were recorded under anesthesia at completion of their implant. In addition, all patients underwent standard post-implant quality assurance including prostate CT and MRI at day 30. These were co-registered, contoured and seeds were identified. Three independent observers contoured and registered the post implant TRUS images to the Day 30 CT using seed matching. Prostate volumes and dosimetric parameters were compared through Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) to evaluate the concordance between MRI and ultrasound (US). RESULTS 26 patients were recruited from 10/17 to 01/18. Mean prostate volume was 34.5 (SD 10.8) cm3 at baseline on planning TRUS images, 37.4 (SD 11.3) cm3 on Day 0 post implant TRUS and 36.7 (SD 11.7) cm3 on Day 30 MRI. D90 was 112.6% (SD 9.3) on CT-MRI and 112.9% (SD 11.1) on CT-US. V100 was 94.6% (SD 3.8) for CT-MRI, 95.1% (SD 4.3) for CT-US. Student t-tests were used to compare groups.

Objective:   To determine whether changes in MRI are associated with pathologic progression for patients on AS.  Design, setting, and participants:   From July 2007 through January 2020, we identified all patients evaluated for AS at our institution. Following confirmatory biopsy, a total of 391 patients who underwent surveillance MRI and biopsy at least once were identified (median follow-up of 35.6 mo, interquartile range 19.7-60.6).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   All MRI intervals were scored using the ""Prostate Cancer Radiologic Estimation of Change in Sequential Evaluation"" (PRECISE) criteria, with PRECISE scores =4 considered a positive change in MRI. A generalized estimating equation-based logistic regression analysis was conducted for all intervals with a PRECISE score of <4 to determine the predictors of Gleason grade group (GG) progression despite stable MRI.  Results and limitations:   A total of 621 MRI intervals were scored by PRECISE and validated by biopsy. The negative predictive value of stable MRI (PRECISE score <4) was greatest for detecting GG1 to?=?GG3 disease (0.94 [0.91-0.97]). If 2-yr surveillance biopsy were performed exclusively for a positive change in MRI, 3.7% (4/109) of avoided biopsies would have resulted in missed progression from GG1 to?=?GG3 disease. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density (odds ratio 1.95 [1.17-3.25], p?=? 0.01) was a risk factor for progression from GG1 to =GG3 disease despite stable MRI.  Conclusions:   In patients with GG1 disease and stable MRI (PRECISE score <4) on surveillance, grade progression to?=?GG3 disease is not common. In patients with grade progression detected on biopsy despite stable MRI, elevated PSA density appeared to be a risk factor for progression to?=?GG3 disease.  Patient summary:   For patients with low-risk prostate cancer on active surveillance, the risk of progressing to grade group 3 disease is low with a stable magnetic resonance image (MRI) after 2?yr.

In a phase I study (NCT02184533) in 15 subjects with metastatic cancer receiving daily oral sodium selenite with palliative radiation therapy, disease stabilization was observed, as evidenced by tumor regression, marked reduction in pain symptoms, and decreased prostate-specific antigen levels (only patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer).  Objective:   The aim of this work was to characterize the pharmacokinetics of selenite to suggest dosing strategies and to propose a study design for further investigation.  Methods:   With selenium plasma concentrations obtained from five dosing cohorts (5.5, 11, 16.5, 33, and 49.5 mg), a population pharmacokinetic model was constructed using NONMEM. The model described externally administered selenite (inorganic) with a baseline component for endogenous selenium levels. Using the pharmacokinetic model, simulations were performed to suggest dosing regimens that achieved in vitro target selenite levels, and optimal pharmacokinetic sampling times for a subsequent study were proposed using PopED.  Results:   A one-compartment model characterized selenite pharmacokinetics. Parameter estimates were absorption rate constant (0.64 h-1), apparent clearance (1.58 L/h), apparent volume of distribution (42.3 L), and baseline selenium amount (5270 μg). A logarithmic function characterized the inverse relationship between dose level and bioavailability. Four regimens to reach in vitro target selenite levels were proposed: 33 mg daily, 16.5 mg twice daily (BID), 11 mg BID, and 5.5 mg thrice daily (TID). Optimal sampling times were 1, 2, 6, and 24 h.  Discussion:   The population model described the pharmacokinetic data well. Three regimens (33 mg daily, 11 mg BID, 5.5 mg TID) achieved in vitro target selenite levels after one dose.

Maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) were determined by manually placing the region of interest to the primary tumor in the prostate gland. Patients were divided into groups according to their prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values, International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade groups, Gleason Scores (GS), D'Amico risk stratification criteria and the presence of metastasis. Mann Whitney U test was used in the comparison of two groups of data. In multivariate analysis, logistic regression was used to determine independent predictors for the presence of metastasis.  Results:   There were statistically significant differences between D'Amico risk groups in terms of prostate SUVmax levels. The SUVmax levels of the patients in the high risk group were significantly higher than the SUVmax levels of the patients in the low-medium risk groups (P<0.001). Maximum standardized uptake value levels of the patients with PSA level 20ng/mL and above were significantly higher than those with PSA level below 20ng/mL (P<0.001).

We aimed to examine the controversial diagnostic utility of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) for prostate cancer. We analyzed two datasets collected from Europeans and one from Africans. These datasets were generated by the genome-wide association studies, that is, CGEMS, BPC3, and MEC-Africans, respectively. About 540,000 SNPs, including 61 risk markers that constitute a panel termed MK-61, were commonly genotyped. For each dataset, we augmented the MK-61 panel to generate an MK-61+ one by adding several thousands of SNPs that were moderately associated with prostate cancer occurrence in external dataset(s). We assessed the diagnostic utility of both panels by measuring their predictive strength for prostate cancer occurrence with AUC statistics. We calculated the theoretical AUCs using quantitative genetics model-based formulae and obtained the empirical estimates via 10-fold cross-validation using statistical and machine learning techniques. For the MK-61 panel, the 95% confidence intervals of the theoretical AUCs (AUC-CI.95) were 0.578-0.655, 0.596-0.656, and 0.539-0.596 in the CGEMS, BPC3, and MEC-Africans cohorts, respectively. For the MK-61+ panels, the corresponding AUC-CI.95 were 0.617-0.663, 0.527-0.736, and 0.547-0.565. The empirical AUCs largely fell within the theoretical interval. A promising result (AUC = 0.703, FNR = 0.354, FPR = 0.353) was obtained in the BPC3 cohort when the MK-61+ panel was used. In the CGEMS cohort, the MK-61+ panel complemented PSA in predicting the disease status of PSA ≥ 2.0 ng/mL samples. This study demonstrates that augmented risk SNP panels can enhance prostate cancer prediction for males of European ancestry, especially those with [Formula: see text]ng/mL.

However, the therapeutic benefit remains unproven; although most radical prostatectomies at academic centers are accompanied by PLND, there is no consensus regarding the optimal anatomical extent of PLND.  Objective:   To evaluate whether extended PLND results in a lower biochemical recurrence rate.  Design, setting, and participants:   We conducted a single-center randomized trial. Patients, enrolled between October 2011 and March 2017, were scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy and PLND. Patients were assigned to limited or extended PLND by cluster randomization. Specifically, surgeons were randomized to perform limited or extended PLND for 3-mo periods.  Intervention:   Randomization to limited (external iliac nodes) or extended (external iliac, obturator fossa and hypogastric nodes) PLND.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary endpoint was the rate of biochemical recurrence.  Results and limitations:   Of 1440 patients included in the final analysis, 700 were randomized to limited PLND and 740 to extended PLND. The median number of nodes retrieved was 12 (interquartile range [IQR] 8-17) for limited PLND and 14 (IQR 10-20) extended PLND; the corresponding rate of positive nodes was 12% and 14% (difference -1.9%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -5.4% to 1.5%; p = 0.3). With median follow-up of 3.1 yr, there was no significant difference in the rate of biochemical recurrence between the groups (hazard ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.93-1.15; p = 0.5). Rates for grade 2 and 3 complications were similar at 7.3% for limited versus 6.4% for extended PLND; there were no grade 4 or 5 complications.  Conclusions:   Extended PLND did not improve freedom from biochemical recurrence over limited PLND for men with clinically localized prostate cancer. However, there were smaller than expected differences in nodal count and the rate of positive nodes between the two templates. A randomized trial comparing PLND to no node dissection is warranted.  Patient summary:   In this clinical trial we did not find a difference in the rate of biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer between limited and extended dissection of lymph nodes in the pelvis.

Whether this is due to a real biological effect or to a diagnostic bias is still unknown. We hypothesized that the introduction of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has improved the diagnostic accuracy of PCa detection in older men thus reducing the risk of GG upgrading at RP reported in the pre-MRI era.  Materials and methods:   We selected 424 men who received a systematic plus targeted biopsy for a positive MRI and subsequent RP at two referral centers between 2013 and 2019. Upgrading was defined as an increase in GG at final pathology as compared to biopsy. Multivariable logistic regressions tested the risk of upgrading over increasing age according to any upgrading definition and after stratifying definitions according to GG group and biopsy type. Non-parametric functions explored the relationship between age and upgrading rate.  Results:   Median rate of upgrading was 17%. In multivariable models, while age was not associated with increased risk of GG upgrading (p=0.4). At non-parametric analyses, probability of upgrading slightly decreased with age, without reaching statistical significance. In subgroup analyses according to different upgrading definition and to biopsy type, age did not predict higher risk of upgrading regardless of outcome definitions (GG 1 to 2 P = 0.1; GG 2 to 3 P = 0.2; GG 3 to 4-5 P = 0.2) and in GG detected at TBx (OR 0.998, P = 0.8).  Conclusions:   We showed that use of MRI has obliterated the association between older age and increased risk of upgrading mainly due to improved diagnostic approaches in this group of men. Therefore, it is likely that the effect of age and GG upgrading reported in previous studies in elderly men was due to misdiagnosis and lead-time bias in the pre-MRI era.""","""['Elio Mazzone', 'Armando Stabile', 'Gabriele Sorce', 'Francesco Pellegrino', 'Francesco Barletta', 'Giovanni Motterle', 'Simone Scuderi', 'Giuseppe Ottone Cirulli', 'Vito Cucchiara', 'Giorgio Brembilla', 'Antonio Esposito', 'Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Nicola Fossati', 'Francesco De Cobelli', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Ilaria Guccini', 'Alberto Briganti']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['The Key Combined Value of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted and Concomitant Systematic Biopsies for the Prediction of Adverse Pathological Features in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Role of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging to predict postoperative Gleason score upgrading in prostate cancer with Gleason score 3\u2009+\u20094.', 'PI-RADS v2 and periprostatic fat measured on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging can predict upgrading in radical prostatectomy pathology amongst patients with biopsy Gleason score 3\u2009+\u20093 prostate cancer.', 'Risk of adverse pathology at prostatectomy in the era of MRI and targeted biopsies; rethinking active surveillance for intermediate risk prostate cancer patients.', 'Impact of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeting on Pathologic Upgrading and Downgrading at Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Impact of prostate MRI central review over the diagnostic performance of MRI-targeted biopsy: should we routinely ask for an expert second opinion?', 'Grade and stage misclassification in intermediate unfavorable-risk prostate cancer radiotherapy candidates.']"""

However, whether PART1 is associated with the malignant progression of pancreatic cancer remains unclear. In the current study, we aimed to identify the role and potential mechanism of PART1 in pancreatic cancer.  Methods:   qRT-PCR was applied to detect PART1 expression in 45 cases of pancreatic cancer patients. The chi-square test was performed to assess the association between PART1 expression and clinicopathologic features, and Kaplan-Meier method was applied to evaluate overall survival. In vitro CCK-8, transwell invasion, and flow cytometry assays were applied to detect the effects of PART1 on cell proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis, respectively. Luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation assays were used to identify the regulatory mechanism between PART1 and miR-122.  Results:   PART1 expression was upregulated in pancreatic cancer tissues and cell lines. High PART1 expression was closely correlated with tumor size, T classification, clinical stage, and vascular invasion, and predicted a poor overall survival. PART1 knockdown significantly suppressed cell proliferation and invasion abilities of pancreatic cancer but promoted cell apoptosis. PART1 was found to serve as a molecular sponge of miR-122, and miR-122 inhibition partially reversed the inhibitory phenotypes of PART1 knockdown on pancreatic cancer cells.

This calls for a flexible modeling framework to yield efficient survival prediction. Moreover, for some survival studies involving time to occurrence of some asymptomatic events, survival times are typically interval censored between consecutive clinical inspections. In this article, we propose a robust semiparametric model for clustered interval-censored survival data under a paradigm of Bayesian ensemble learning, called soft Bayesian additive regression trees or SBART (Linero and Yang, 2018), which combines multiple sparse (soft) decision trees to attain excellent predictive accuracy. We develop a novel semiparametric hazards regression model by modeling the hazard function as a product of a parametric baseline hazard function and a nonparametric component that uses SBART to incorporate clustering, unknown functional forms of the main effects, and interaction effects of various covariates. In addition to being applicable for left-censored, right-censored, and interval-censored survival data, our methodology is implemented using a data augmentation scheme which allows for existing Bayesian backfitting algorithms to be used. We illustrate the practical implementation and advantages of our method via simulation studies and an analysis of a prostate cancer surgery study where dependence on the experience and skill level of the physicians leads to clustering of survival times.

Here, we characterize the expression of ISL1 and its partners in PCa and document its association to disease progression and post castration resistance neuroendocrine differentiation.  Methods:   The expression of ISL1 was interrogated in > 6000 primary samples from the Decipher GRID registry and 250 mCRPC samples to assess its prognostic value and relation to neuroendocrine differentiation.  Results:   ISL1 was highly correlated to MEIS genes and other genes related to cell motility. ISL1 down-regulation in PCa was associated with cancer progression, aggressive primary tumors, and metastatic outcome. We found that ISL1 is highly correlated to MEIS genes across multiple primary PCa and mCRPC cohorts. The expression of ISL1 and MEIS genes were significantly and inversely related to metastasis-free survival and lethal disease, and were downregulated in CRPC and hormone naïve metastatic tumors but showed upregulation in neuroendocrine tumors. Co-immunoprecipitation showed MEIS2 and ISL1 interacting with each supporting their role in modulating transcriptional regulation and nominating this complex for potential targeted therapy.

Preventing resistance to ADT may therefore be achieved by using NF-κB inhibitors. However, low oral bioavailability and high toxicity of NF-κB inhibitors is a major challenge for clinical translation. Dimethylaminoparthenolide (DMAPT) is an oral NF-κB inhibitor in clinical development and has already shown favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodyanamic data in patients with heme malignancies, including decrease of NF-κB in circulating leuchemic blasts. Here, we report that activation of NF-κB/p65 by castration in mouse and human prostate cancer models resulted in a significant increase in AR variant-7 (AR-V7) expression and modest upregulation of AR. In vivo castration of VCaP-CR tumors resulted in significant upregulation of phosphorylated-p65 and AR-V7, which was attenuated by combination with DMAPT and DMAPT increased the efficacy of AR inhibition. We further demonstrate that the effects of DMAPT-sensitizing prostate cancer cells to castration were dependent on the ability of DMAPT to inhibit phosphorylated-p65 function. IMPLICATIONS: Our study shows that DMAPT, an oral NF-κB inhibitor in clinical development, inhibits phosphorylated-p65 upregulation of AR-V7 and delays prostate cancer castration resistance. This provides rationale for the development of DMAPT as a novel therapeutic strategy to increase durable response in patients receiving AR-targeted therapy.""","""['Katherine L Morel', 'Anis A Hamid', 'John G Clohessy', 'Nicole Pandell', 'Leigh Ellis', 'Christopher J Sweeney']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Melatonin Inhibits Androgen Receptor Splice Variant-7 (AR-V7)-Induced Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-κB) Activation and NF-κB Activator-Induced AR-V7 Expression in Prostate Cancer Cells: Potential Implications for the Use of Melatonin in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) Therapy.', 'CX4945 suppresses the growth of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells by reducing AR-V7 expression.', 'DMAPT inhibits NF-κB activity and increases sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to X-rays in vitro and in tumor xenografts in vivo.', 'Androgen receptor splicing variant 7: Beyond being a constitutively active variant.', 'Development of AR-V7 as a putative treatment selection marker for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Toad venom-derived bufadienolides and their therapeutic application in prostate cancers: Current status and future directions.', 'Androgen Receptor Signaling Inhibition in Advanced Castration Resistance Prostate Cancer: What Is Expected for the Near Future?']"""

Black men are nearly three times more likely to suffer prostate cancer, with one in four contracting the disease in their lifetime. Despite being a high risk group very few black men aged 45 and over visit their GP to discuss the pros and cons of screening. This is a problem as early onset of the disease presents no symptoms and when symptoms do appear, such as urinary problems, and men do visit a doctor it is often too late to reverse the cancer's spread. This study investigates using the strong social norm of wives and girlfriends being the guardian of black men's health as a way of influencing their behaviour.  Methods:   Using a historically controlled study via email we tested the social norm nudge in the field with 13 Afro-Caribbean organisations across the UK.  Results:   The trial found the social norm nudge produced a 15.5 per cent click-through rate, which was significantly higher than the historical controls. Meanwhile, the messenger effect saw a click-through rate of 38.5 per cent on men.  Conclusion:   At a national level the social norm nudge would equate to 37,315 black women taking positive action to find out more information about their husband or boyfriend's high risk of contracting prostate cancer.

In patients with nonmetastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (M0CSPC) who already have osteoporosis before starting ADT, appropriate bone-modifying agent intervention must be performed in parallel, as the patient has a high risk of future fracture. However, little is known about therapeutic interventions aimed at preventing the progression of CTIBL and new fractures. The present study explored the effect of once-yearly zoledronic acid 5 mg (ZOL 5 mg) on bone mineral density (BMD) and new vertebral fractures (VFs) in M0CSPC patients with coexisting osteoporosis before starting ADT.  Methods:   We conducted a retrospective, multi-institutional, cohort study involving 42 M0CSPC patients with osteoporosis who had undergone ADT with/without a single intravenous infusion of ZOL 5 mg at the start of ADT (ZOL 5 mg group, n = 26; control group, n = 16). The association of the ZOL 5 mg with changes in the BMD from baseline to 12 months and the incidence of VFs were evaluated.  Results:   Prevalent VFs were found in 47.6% of all patients at baseline. ZOL 5 mg significantly increased the lumbar spine BMD (LS-BMD) (mean rate of change: + 4.02%, p < 0.0001) and significantly decreased the TRACP-5b (mean rate of change: - 52.1%, p < 0.0001) at 12 months after starting ADT. Incident VFs were identified in 19.0% of all patients at 12 months after starting ADT. After adjusting for the age, BMI, and changes in the LS-BMD, ZOL 5 mg was not significantly associated with incident VFs (odds ratio 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.04-11.3, p = 0.7774).  Conclusion:   ZOL 5 mg significantly increased the LS-BMD 12 months after starting ADT, and our short-term results showed that ZOL 5 mg was not significantly correlated with the suppression of incident vertebral fractures.""","""['Daisuke Watanabe', 'Takahiro Kimura', 'Ken Watanabe', 'Hiromitsu Takano', 'Yuko Uehara', 'Tadaaki Minowa', 'Akemi Yamashita', 'Seiichiro Yoshikawa', 'Akio Mizushima']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Efficacy and safety of once-yearly zoledronic acid in Japanese patients with primary osteoporosis: two-year results from a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study (ZOledroNate treatment in Efficacy to osteoporosis; ZONE study).', 'Modeling and simulation of bone mineral density in Japanese osteoporosis patients treated with zoledronic acid using tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b, a bone resorption marker.', 'Efficacy and safety of a once-yearly intravenous zoledronic acid 5 mg for fracture prevention in elderly postmenopausal women with osteoporosis aged 75 and older.', 'The role of zoledronic acid in the management of osteoporosis.', 'Osteoporosis in men with prostate carcinoma receiving androgen-deprivation therapy: recommendations for diagnosis and therapies.']"""

Considering the main function of GMFG in actin remodeling, which is vital for immune response, angiogenesis, cell division and motility, GMFG is supposed to have important roles in tumor development, while up to now, only two studies described the role of GMFG in cancers. By investigating the clinical values of GMFG using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data and the functional mechanisms of GMFG through analyses of Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichments, this study was aimed to better understand the impact of GMFG in pan-cancers and to draw more attentions for the future research of GMFG.  Methods:   RNA-seq and clinical data of cancer patients were collected from TCGA and analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier methods. GO and KEGG analyses were conducted using the online tools from the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID).  Results:   Compared to the corresponding normal samples, GMFG was significantly upregulated in glioblastoma (GBM), kidney clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), lower grade glioma (LGG), acute myeloid leukemia (LAML), and pancreatic cancer (PAAD), testicular cancer (TGCT), but was downregulated in kidney chromophobe (KICH), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) (P < 0.05 for all). High expression of GMFG predicted worse OS in GBM (HR = 1.5, P = 0.017), LGG (HR = 2.2, P < 0.001), LUSC (HR = 1.4, P = 0.022) and ocular melanomas (UVM) (HR = 7, P < 0.001), as well as worse DFS in LGG (HR = 1.8, P < 0.001) and prostate cancer (PRAD) (HR = 1.9, P = 0.004). In contrast, high expression of GMFG was associated with better OS in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) (HR = 0.59, P < 0.001) and thymoma (THYM) (HR = 0.098, P = 0.031), as well as better DFS in bile duct cancer (CHOL) (HR = 0.2, P = 0.003). GMFG was mainly involved in the immune response, protein binding and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathways, and was positively associated with multiple immunomodulators in most cancers.

However, to date, no studies have tested the expression of UPII in histological mimickers of bladder cancer that are nonurothelial in origin. Given the potential risk of misdiagnosis, immunohistochemical markers are often used to better characterize these lesions. In the present study, we analyzed the immunohistochemical expression of UPII in a set of urothelial carcinoma mimickers that included conventional nephrogenic adenoma (n = 8), papillary nephrogenic adenoma (n = 6), endometriosis/endosalpingiosis (n = 5), inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (n = 4), ectopic prostate tissue (n = 2), and malakoplakia (n = 2). We also examined the expression of GATA-3, another commonly used immunohistochemical marker in bladder cancer diagnosis, in the same lesions. Weak immunoreactivity for UPII was identified in 6 of 27 mimickers (22%), and GATA-3 was expressed in 16 of 27 mimickers (59%). Strong immunoreactivity for UPII appeared to be a specific marker for urothelial cell of origin, although weak staining was seen in a significant proportion of mimickers. GATA-3 immunostaining was present in a greater number and broader spectrum of mimickers; however, only one case of papillary nephrogenic adenoma showed dual positivity for UPII and GATA-3. These findings support the immunohistochemical panel-based approach in the diagnosis of bladder lesions, especially if nonurothelial bladder cancer mimickers are in the differential diagnosis.

However, the role of BZW1 in prostate cancer remains unknown. This study is aimed to investigate the expression of BZW1 and its influence on cell proliferation in prostate cancer. Then, the expression levels of BZW1 were measured in 136 cases of prostate cancer and matched adjacent non-cancerous prostate tissues by quantificational real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The effect of BZW1 on cell proliferation was further explored. QRT-PCR analysis showed that the mRNA levels of BZW1 in prostate cancer were significantly greater compared with those in matched adjacent non-cancerous prostate tissues (P< 0.001). IHC results showed that the high-expression rates of BZW1 in prostate cancer and matched adjacent non-cancerous prostate tissues were 68.4% and 32.4%, and the difference was statistically significant (P< 0.001). BZW1 high expression significantly correlated with T stage, lymph node metastasis, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and Gleason score (P< 0.05). Patients with BZW1 high expression presented unfavorable prognosis compared with those with BZW1 low expression (P= 0.002). In addition, CCK-8 and colony formation assays revealed that BZW1 overexpression significantly promoted cell proliferation in vitro. Tumor xenograft has shown that BZW1 knockdown significantly inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, BZW1 overexpression activated the TGF-β1/Smad1/Smad3 pathway.

Between 2002 and 2015, we included 1,196,563 men aged 50 years and above in the analyses. Multilevel logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between exposure and outcome, adjusting for potential confounding factors.  Results:   The total incidence of prostate cancer and mortality in patients with prostate cancer were 8.22 (per 100) and 1.80 (per 100), respectively, during the follow-up period. Individuals living in neighborhoods with low (OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.88-0.93) and intermediate (OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.92-0.96) linking social capital were less likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer than those living in neighborhoods with high linking social capital. Opposite effects were observed for mortality; prostate cancer patients living in neighborhoods with low (OR 1.15; 95% CI 1.08-1.23) and intermediate (OR 1.09; 95% CI 1.03-1.14) linking social capital were more likely to die from prostate cancer than those in neighborhoods with high linking social capital.

HT in a temperature range of 40-47 °C (thermal dose CEM43 ≥ 25) could work as a sensitizer to radiation therapy (RT). Here, we attempted to understand the tumor radiosensitization effect at the cellular level after a combination treatment of FUS+RT.  Methods:   An in vitro FUS system was developed to induce HT at frequencies of 1.147 and 1.467 MHz. Human head and neck cancer (FaDU), glioblastoma (T98G), and prostate cancer (PC-3) cells were exposed to FUS in ultrasound-penetrable 96-well plates followed by single-dose X‑ray irradiation (10 Gy). Radiosensitizing effects of FUS were investigated by cell metabolic activity (WST‑1 assay), apoptosis (annexin V assay, sub-G1 assay), cell cycle phases (propidium iodide staining), and DNA double-strand breaks (γH2A.X assay).  Results:   The FUS intensities of 213 (1.147 MHz) and 225 W/cm2 (1.467 MHz) induced HT for 30 min at mean temperatures of 45.20 ± 2.29 °C (CEM43 = 436 ± 88) and 45.59 ± 1.65 °C (CEM43 = 447 ± 79), respectively. FUS improves the effect of RT significantly by reducing metabolic activity in T98G cells 48 h (RT: 96.47 ± 8.29%; FUS+RT: 79.38 ± 14.93%; p = 0.012) and in PC-3 cells 72 h (54.20 ± 10.85%; 41.01 ± 11.17%; p = 0.016) after therapy, but not in FaDu cells. Mechanistically, FUS+RT leads to increased apoptosis and enhancement of DNA double-strand breaks compared to RT alone in T98G and PC-3 cells.

Little evidence supports its safe use to treat patients with multiple metastases.  Objective:   To establish safety of SBRT dose schedules in patients with 3 to 4 metastases or 2 metastases in close proximity to each other.  Design, setting, and participants:   This phase 1 trial opened on August 4, 2014, and closed to accrual on March 20, 2018. Metastases to 7 anatomic locations were included: bone/osseous (BO), spinal/paraspinal (SP), peripheral lung (PL), central lung (CL), abdominal-pelvic (AP), mediastinal/cervical lymph node (MC), and liver (L). Six patients could be enrolled per anatomic site. The setting was a consortium of North American academic and community practice cancer centers participating in NRG Oncology trials. Patients with breast, prostate, or non-small cell lung cancer with 3 to 4 metastases or 2 metastases in close proximity (≤5 cm) amenable to SBRT were eligible for this phase 1 study. Statistical analyses were performed from December 31, 2017, to September 19, 2019.  Interventions:   The starting dose was 50 Gy in 5 fractions (CL, MC), 45 Gy in 3 fractions (PL, AP, L), and 30 Gy in 3 fractions (BO, SP).  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary end point was dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0, as specific adverse events (AEs) of grades 3 to 5 (definite or probable per the protocol DLT definition) related to SBRT within 180 days of treatment. Dose levels were considered safe if DLTs were observed in no more than 1 of 6 patients per location; otherwise, the dose at that location would be de-escalated.  Results:   A total of 42 patients enrolled, 39 were eligible, and 35 (mean [SD] age, 63.1 [14.2] years; 20 men [57.1%]; 30 White patients [85.7%]) were evaluable for DLT. Twelve patients (34.3%) had breast cancer, 10 (28.6%) had non-small cell lung cancer, and 13 (37.1%) had prostate cancer; there was a median of 3 metastases treated per patient. Median survival was not reached. No protocol-defined DLTs were observed. When examining all AEs, 8 instances of grade 3 AEs, most likely related to protocol therapy, occurred approximately 125 to 556 days from SBRT initiation in 7 patients.  Conclusions and relevance:   This phase 1 trial demonstrated the safety of SBRT for patients with 3 to 4 metastases or 2 metastases in close proximity. There were no treatment-related deaths. Late grade 3 AEs demonstrate the need for extended follow-up in long-surviving patients with oligometastatic disease.

An insight is given into the improvement made in different cancer types, population groups and prognostic factors.  Materials and methods:   The principal data source was the population-based Slovenian Cancer Registry. The survival analysis included patients diagnosed with cancer in twenty years period from 1997 to 2016, which has been divided into four consecutive five-year periods. In addition, the analysis was stratified by cancer type, gender, age and stage. The survival was estimated using net survival calculated by the Pohar-Perme method and the complete approach has been applied.  Results:   The survival of Slovenian cancer patients has been increasing over time. During the 20 years observed, five-year net survival increased by 11 percentage points. Significantly higher growth was observed in men. Age and stage at diagnosis are still crucial for the survival of cancer patients. Five-year net survival is lowest in those over 75 years of age at diagnosis but has also improved by seven percentage points over the past 20 years. The five-year net survival of patients in the localized stage increased by ten percentage points over the 20 years under observation. Survival of patients in the distant stage has not been improving. In both sexes, survival for melanoma, colorectal and lung cancers have increased significantly over the last 20 years. Progress has also been made in the two most common gender specific cancers: breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in men. Still, the significant progress in prostate cancer is probably mostly due to lead-time bias as during the study period, Slovenia used indiscriminate PSA testing, which probably artificially prolonged survival.  Conclusions:   The survival of Slovenian cancer patients has been increasing over time, which gives us a basis and an incentive for future improvements. To monitor the effectiveness of managing the cancer epidemic, the cancer burden needs to be monitored also in the future, using quality data and scientifically justified methodological approaches.

Patients and methods:   Twenty-eight prostate cancer patients (median age 70) with localized disease (cT1c-2c, N0, M0) and intermediate risk features (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] < 20, Gleason score ≤ 7b) were treated in a prospective study with the CovP concept. Planning-CTs were performed on three subsequent days to capture form changes and movement of prostate and OARs. The clinical target volume (CTV) prostate and the OARs (bladder and rectum) were contoured in each CT. The union of CTV1-3 was encompassed by an isotropic margin of 7 mm to define the internal target volume (ITV). Dose prescription/escalation depended on coverage of all CTVs within the ITV. IMRT was given in 39 fractions to 78 Gy using the Monte-Carlo algorithm. Short-term androgen deprivation was recommended and given in 78.6% of patients.  Results:   Long-term toxicity was evaluated in 26/28 patients after a median follow-up of 7.1 years. At last follow-up, late bladder toxicity (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group, RTOG) G1 was observed in 14.3% of patients and late rectal toxicities (RTOG) of G1 (7.1%) and of G2 (3.6%) were observed. No higher graded toxicity occurred. After 7.1 years, biochemical control (biochemically no evidence of disease, bNED) was 95.5%, prostate cancer-specific survival and the distant metastasis-free survival after 7.1 years were 100% each.

We aimed to explore its mechanism in facilitating the malignancy of prostate cancer.  Methods:   The expression of DANCR, microRNA (miR)-185-5p and LIM and SH3 protein 1 (LASP1) in 40 pairs of prostate cancer tissues and normal tissues, five prostate cancer cell lines and one epithelial cell line was assessed by a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. In transfected PC3 and C4-2 cells, cell proliferation, migration, invasion, cell cycle distribution and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) protein expression were tested via cell counting kit-8, wound healing, transwell, flow cytometry and western blot assays, respectively. The interactions between DANCR, miR-185-5p and LASP1 were verified by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Rescue experiments were conducted to determine the roles of DANCR on the malignant properties of PC3 and C4-2 cells. The involvement of the signaling pathway was examined using a p-FAK inhibitor.  Results:   DANCR and LASP1 expression was enhanced, whereas miR-185-5p expression was diminished in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. Knockdown of DANCR suppressed cell proliferation, migration, invasion, G1-S transition and expression of EMT proteins of the transfected PC3 and C4-2 cells. DANCR sponged miR-185-5p to upregulate LASP1 expression. DANCR-miR-185-5p-LASP1 axis activates the FAK/PI3K/AKT/GSK3β/Snail pathway to promote the malignant properties of PC3 and C4-2 cells.  Conclusions:   These findings suggest that DANCR exerts oncogenic roles in prostate cancer via the miR-185-5p/LASP1 axis activating the FAK/PI3K/AKT/GSK3β/Snail pathway.

By combining lipidomic and proteomic approaches with functional analysis, we have shown that ubiquitin domain-containing protein 1 (UBTD1) plays a crucial role in both the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) self-phosphorylation and its lysosomal degradation. On the one hand, by modulating the cellular level of ceramides through N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase 1 (ASAH1) ubiquitination, UBTD1 controls the ligand-independent phosphorylation of EGFR. On the other hand, UBTD1, via the ubiquitination of Sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1/p62) by RNF26 and endolysosome positioning, participates in the lysosomal degradation of EGFR. The coordination of these two ubiquitin-dependent processes contributes to the control of the duration of the EGFR signal.

We compared the ability of weekly ratings and descriptors of daily ratings to evaluate pain as an endpoint in a randomized phase 3 drug trial.  Methods:   Participants (n = 119) with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were randomized to treatment arms and rated their pain on the average and at its worst during a baseline week and at weeks 3, 6, and 12 of study treatment. For each reporting period, participants rated their pain daily for 7 days. On day 7, participants rated their pain over the prior 7 days. We estimated mean differences and intraclass correlation coefficients of the weekly ratings and the mean and the maximum daily ratings. We compared the ability of the weekly ratings and the daily rating descriptors to detect change in pain and evaluated the agreement of the weekly rating and the mean daily rating of pain at its worst to detect treatment response.  Results:   For both pain constructs, the weekly rating was consistently higher than the mean daily rating and lower than the maximum daily rating yet was moderately to highly correlated with both daily rating descriptors (intraclass correlation coefficient range = 0.55-0.94). The weekly rating and the daily rating descriptors consistently detected change in pain for the study sample and participant subgroups. Substantial agreement existed between the weekly rating and the mean daily rating of pain at its worst when used with trial protocol opioid criteria to detect treatment response (Cohen's κ = 0.71).  Conclusion:   Use of daily over weekly ratings delivered no added benefit in evaluating pain in this clinical trial. This study is the first to compare weekly and daily recall to measure pain as an endpoint in a randomized phase 3 drug trial, and the pattern of differences in ratings that we observed is consistent with other recent evaluations of weekly and daily symptom reporting.""","""['Elisabeth M Schaffer', 'Ethan M Basch', 'Gisela M Schwab', 'Antonia V Bennett']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Clin Trials""","""['Cabozantinib Versus Mitoxantrone-prednisone in Symptomatic Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: A Randomized Phase 3 Trial with a Primary Pain Endpoint.', 'Effects of cabozantinib on pain and narcotic use in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer: results from a phase 2 nonrandomized expansion cohort.', 'Cabozantinib for Progressive Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Following Docetaxel: Combined Analysis of Two Phase 3 Trials.', 'Current role of cabozantinib in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Novel Augmentation Strategies in Major Depression.', 'Systematic Review of the Effect of a One-Day Versus Seven-Day Recall Duration on Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs).', 'Prevalence and associations of fatigue in childhood atopic dermatitis: A cross-sectional study.']"""

In terms of specific cancers, the greatest increases in cases are predicted for thyroid (113.8%), prostate (66.7%), female breast (63.0%) and colorectal cancer (54.1%). Breast, colorectal and stomach cancers were the most common cancers in Iran in 2016 and are predicted to remain the leading cancers nationally in 2025.

Its expression in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) has been confirmed in many recent studies, but systematic studies exploring PSMA expression in patients with DTC with thyroglobulin elevation and negative iodine scintigraphy (TENIS) are lacking. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of PSMA scan in TENIS patients with DTC.  Methods:   Nine consecutive patients with DTC with proven TENIS syndrome (6 men and 3 women with age range 29-68 years and mean age of 48 years) underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT as per the institution protocol. Thereafter, they were subjected to 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT as per the institution protocol within a week of FDG PET imaging. Prostate-specific membrane antigen expression (SUVmax) in the lesions was compared with 18F-FDG PET and CT scan findings.  Results:   In 5 of 9 patients with TENIS, the metastatic lesions showed PSMA expression. A total of 14 lesions were seen on the CT scan. Prostate-specific membrane antigen PET detected 9 of 14 lesions (64.28%) (SUVmax ranging from 10.1 to 45.67; median SUVmax of 16.31), whereas FDG PET was positive in 11 of 14 lesions (78.57%). The lesions that showed PSMA uptake was localized to bones (5 of 9) and lungs (4 of 9). Two lesions that were localized to iliac crest and acetabulum were missed on FDG PET but were seen on CT and PSMA PET scan.  Conclusions:   The results of this pilot study indicate that 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA PET/CT demonstrates PSMA expression in TENIS patients with lesions being localized to the bones and lungs. 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT could be useful for the identification of TENIS patients who might benefit from PSMA-targeted radionuclide therapy.""","""['Priyanka Verma', 'Gaurav Malhotra', 'Vilas Meshram', 'Ashok Chandak', 'Sunita Sonavane', 'Anurag R Lila', 'Tushar R Bandgar', 'Ramesh V Asopa']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Clin Nucl Med""","""['Evidence of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Expression in Metastatic Differentiated Thyroid Cancer Using 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT.', 'Imaging of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Expression in Metastatic Differentiated Thyroid Cancer Using 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA PET/CT.', 'The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted radiotracer 18F-DCFPyL detects tumor neovasculature in metastatic, advanced, radioiodine-refractory, differentiated thyroid cancer.', 'The role of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan in biochemical recurrence after primary treatment for prostate cancer: a systematic review of the literature.', 'Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography in Thyroid Cancer.', 'Potential Role of PSMA-Targeted PET in Thyroid Malignant Disease: A Systematic Review.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen expression predicts recurrence of papillary thyroid carcinoma after total thyroidectomy.', 'Advanced imaging and theranostics in thyroid cancer.', 'PSMA Radioligand Uptake as a Biomarker of Neoangiogenesis in Solid Tumours: Diagnostic or Theragnostic Factor?', 'Positron Emission Tomography Radiopharmaceuticals in Differentiated Thyroid Cancer.']"""

Methods:   Patients with UM were enrolled in a prospective study. All patients were staged with preoperative CT and 64Cu(II)Cl2 PET/CT. Patient characteristics, anatomical and functional imaging, and final histopathology were recorded. Surgical specimens for histopathological examination were collected. To determine time-activity curves for 64Cu(II)Cl2 uptake in UM and normal tissues, SUVs were calculated. The safety of 64Cu(II)Cl2 was assessed.  Results:   Twenty-three patients were included. An administered activity of 174.7 MBq (4.72 mCi) for 64Cu(II)Cl2 was equal to 9.80 mSv of the effective dose. The median SUVmax values were 5.7, 0.9, 1.8, and 9.8 for the prostate, bladder, penis, and kidney, respectively. Median SUVmax values were higher in organs with a malignancy in comparison with healthy tissue (prostate [11.5 vs 5.3, P < 0.001], bladder [6.2 vs 0.9, P = 0.007], and penis [3.9 vs 1.3, P = 0.027]), but not in the kidneys (5.0 vs 10.4, P = 0.998). The highest area under the curve (AUC) was reported for prostate cancer (AUC, 0.978), and the lowest for penile cancer (AUC, 0.775). The detection rates based on the best suggested cutoff according to the SUVmax were 85.7% (6/7) for prostate and bladder and 83.3% (5/6) for penile cancer. Neither drug-related effects nor physiologic responses occurred, nor adverse reactions.  Conclusions:   64Cu(II)Cl2 is an effective and well-tolerated tracer in patients with UM. Our results show higher SUVmax in cancer patients than in healthy subjects.

However, little is known about survivors' preferences for treating CRF and associated symptoms.  Objective:   The aim of this study was to examine cancer survivors' interest in learning skills to manage CRF and associated symptoms and their interest in various nonpharmacologic interventions and modalities. These outcomes were compared between survivors with high and normal fatigue.  Methods:   Breast, gastrointestinal, lung, and prostate cancer survivors (N = 338) completed a 1-time survey, including a Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System fatigue measure and a checklist assessing interest in learning skills to manage CRF and associated symptoms as well as interest in nonpharmacologic interventions and modalities.  Results:   Many cancer survivors reported interest in learning skills to manage CRF (range, 35%-78%) and associated symptoms (range, 13%-48%). Compared with survivors with normal fatigue (n = 180), highly fatigued survivors (n = 158; Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System fatigue T score ≥ 55) were more likely to report interest in learning skills to manage various symptoms, self-compassion training, and programs offered individually and in person. Interest in other interventions and modalities did not vary by fatigue level.  Conclusions:   Many cancer survivors, especially those with high fatigue, report interest in learning symptom management skills. Given survivors' high level of interest in complementary and integrative health interventions, future research should continue to assess their impact on symptoms and functioning.  Implications for practice:   Nurses can offer a menu of evidence-based options for symptom management, given survivors' diverse preferences.

Current models of survivorship care are no longer adequate to address the chronic and complex survivorship needs of patients today. Virtual care models for cancer survivorship have recently been associated with comparable clinical outcomes and lower costs to traditional follow-up care, with patients favouring off-site and on-demand visits. Building on their viability, our research group conceived the Ned Clinic-a virtual PCa survivorship model that provides patients with access to lab results, collects patient-reported outcomes, alerts clinicians to emerging issues, and promotes patient self-care. Despite the promise of the Ned Clinic, the model remains limited by its dependence on oncology specialists, lack of an autonomous triage algorithm, and has only been implemented among PCa survivors living in Ontario.  Methods and analysis:   Our programme of research comprises two main research objectives: (1) to evaluate the process and cost of implementing and sustaining five nurse-led virtual PCa survivorship clinics in three provinces across Canada and identify barriers and facilitators to implementation success and (2) to assess the impact of these virtual clinics on implementation and effectiveness outcomes of enrolled PCa survivors. The design phase will involve developing an autonomous triage algorithm and redesigning the Ned Clinic towards a nurse-led service model. Site-specific implementation plans will be developed to deploy a localised nurse-led virtual clinic at each centre. Effectiveness will be evaluated using a historical control study comparing the survivorship outcomes of 300 PCa survivors enrolled in the Ned Clinic with 300 PCa survivors receiving traditional follow-up care.  Ethics and dissemination:   Appropriate site-specific ethics approval will be secured prior to each research phase.

Follow-up biopsy in the initial triennium and for-cause biopsy in the subsequent triennium were performed in 16 and four patients, respectively, and cancer was found from the treated lobe in one patient (4% of the cohort) and significant cancer was found from untreated lobes in four patients (17%) in total. Secondary treatments were performed in six patients successfully. Five-year freedom from BF, TF, and metastasis was 71%, 90%, and 100%, respectively. The International Prostate Symptom Score significantly deteriorated at 3 months and reversed itself afterward. The International Index of Erectile Function 5 had no significant decrease.

Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a minimally invasive ablation procedure that has potential applications in the management of prostate cancer in bone. However, a common limitation of IRE is tumor recurrence, which arises from incomplete ablation that allows remaining cancer cells to proliferate. In this study, we combined IRE with radium-223 (Ra-223), a bone-seeking radionuclide that emits short track length alpha particles and thus is associated with reduced damage to the bone marrow and evaluated the impact of the combination treatment on bone-forming prostate cancer tumors.  Methods:   The antitumor activity of IRE and Ra-223 as single agents and in combination was tested in vitro against three bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4)-expressing prostate cancer cell lines (C4-2B-BMP4, Myc-CaP-BMP4, and TRAMP-C2-BMP4). Similar evaluation was performed in vivo using a bone-forming C4-2B-BMP4 tumor model in nude mice.  Results:   IRE and Ra-223 as monotherapy inhibited prostate cancer cell proliferation in vitro, and their combination resulted in significant reduction in cell viability compared to monotherapy. In vivo evaluation revealed that IRE with single-dose administration of Ra-233, compared to IRE alone, reduced the rate of tumor recurrence by 40% following initial apparent complete ablation and decreased the rate of proliferation of incompletely ablated tumor as quantified in Ki-67 staining (53.58 ± 16.0% for IRE vs. 20.12 ± 1.63%; for IRE plus Ra-223; p = 0.004). Histological analysis qualitatively showed the enhanced killing of tumor cells adjacent to bone by Ra-223 compared to those treated with IRE alone.  Conclusion:   IRE in combination with Ra-223, which enhanced the destruction of cancer cells that are adjacent to bone, resulted in reduction of tumor recurrence through improved clearance of proliferative cells in the tumor region.""","""['Raniv D Rojo', 'Joy Vanessa D Perez', 'Jossana A Damasco', 'Guoyu Yu', 'Song-Chang Lin', 'Francisco M Heralde rd', 'Nora M Novone', 'Elmer B Santos', 'Sue-Hwa Lin', 'Marites P Melancon']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Hyperthermia""","""['Application of Irreversible Electroporation Ablation as Adjunctive Treatment for Margin Enhancement: Safety and Efficacy.', 'The safety and efficacy of irreversible electroporation for the ablation of prostate cancer: a multicentre prospective human in vivo pilot study protocol.', 'Antitumor efficacy of liposome-encapsulated NVP-BEZ 235 in combination with irreversible electroporation.', 'Irreversible electroporation (IRE): a narrative review of the development of IRE from the laboratory to a prostate cancer treatment.', 'Irreversible Electroporation: An Emerging Immunomodulatory Therapy on Solid Tumors.']"""

Our study evaluates the effect of three treatment planning system (TPS) parameters on MC and MU using different multi-leaf collimator (MLC) architectures.  Methods:   192 volumetric modulated arc therapy plans were calculated using one virtual prostate phantom considering three main settings: (1) three TPS-parameters (Convergence; Aperture Shape Controller, ASC; and Dose Calculation Resolution, DCR) selected from Eclipse v15.6, (2) four levels of dose-sparing priority for organs at risk (OAR), and (3) two treatment units with same nominal conformity resolution and different MLC architectures (Halcyon-v2 dual-layer MLC, DL-MLC & TrueBeam single-layer MLC, SL-MLC). We use seven complexity metrics to evaluate the MC, including two new metrics for DL-MLC, assessed by their correlation with γ passing rate (GPR) analysis.  Results:   DL-MLC plans demonstrated lower dose-sparing values than SL-MLC plans (p<0.05). TPS-parameters did not change significantly the complexity metrics for either MLC architectures. However, for SL-MLC, significant variations of MU, target volume dose-homogeneity, and dose spillage were associated with ASC and DCR (p<0.05). MU were found to be correlated (highly or moderately) with all complexity metrics (p<0.05) for both MLC plans. Additionally, our new complexity metrics presented a moderate correlation with GPR (r<0.65). An important correlation was demonstrated between MC (plan deliverability) and dose-sparing priority level for DL-MLC.  Conclusions:   TPS-parameters selected do not change MC for DL-MLC architecture, but they might have a potential use to control the MU, PTV homogeneity or dose spillage for SL-MLC. Our new DL-MLC complexity metrics presented important information to be considered in future pre-treatment quality assurance programs. Finally, the prominent dependence between plan deliverability and priority applied to OAR dose sparing for DL-MLC needs to be analyzed and considered as an additional predictor of GPRs in further studies.

The authors sought to provide in-depth analyses of the causes of death for contemporary survivors.  Methods:   The authors performed a population-based cohort study in the United States (2000-2016) to assess causes of death for men diagnosed with PCa stratified by demographics and tumor stage. Using general population data, they calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) as observed-to-expected death ratios.  Results:   In total, 752,092 men with PCa, including 200,302 who died (27%), were assessed. A total of 29,048 men with local/regional disease (17%) died of PCa, whereas more than 4-fold men died of other causes (n = 143,719 [83%]). SMRs for death from noncancer causes (0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77-0.78) suggested that these men were less likely than the general population to die of most other causes. The most common noncancer cause of death was cardiac-related (23%; SMR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.75-0.77). Among men with distant PCa, 90% of deaths occurred within 5 years of diagnosis. Although deaths due to PCa composed the majority of deaths (74%), SMRs suggested that men with distant PCa were at heightened risk for death from most other noncancer causes (1.50; 95% CI, 1.46-1.54) and, in particular, for cardiac-related death (SMR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.41-1.54) and suicide (SMR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.78-2.96). Further analyses demonstrated that causes of death varied by patient demographics.  Conclusions:   Causes of death during PCa survivorship vary by patient and tumor characteristics. These data provide valuable information regarding health care prioritization during PCa survivorship.  Lay summary:   Men with early-stage prostate cancer are 4-fold more likely to die of other causes, whereas those with advanced prostate cancer are at increased risk for several causes not related to prostate cancer in comparison with the general population.

It was hypothesized that replacing luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists with a 5-α-reductase inhibitor (5-ARI) would improve hormonal health-related quality of life (HRQOL) without differentially suppressing androgen-responsive (AR) gene expression.  Methods:   Patients with localized unfavorable-risk PCa, aged ≥70 years or Charlson Comorbidity Index score ≥2 were treated with oral ADT (oADT), consisting of 4 months of bicalutamide, a 5-ARI, and RT at 78 Gy. The primary end point was Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite HRQOL at 6 months ≤30%, and improvement compared with a synchronous standard of care (SOC) cohort receiving 4 months of bicalutamide and long-term LHRH agonist with RT. RNA sequencing was performed from matched pre-/post-ADT prostate tumor biopsies in a subset of men. Differential gene and pathway expressional changes were examined using gene set enrichment.  Results:   Between 2011 and 2018, 40 and 30 men were enrolled in the oADT and SOC cohorts, respectively. Median follow-up was 40 months. Those with ≤30% decline in hormonal HRQOL at 6 months was 97% (oADT) and 93% (SOC). The average 6-month hormonal decline was 1% (oADT) versus 12% (SOC; P = .04). The 4-year freedom from biochemical failure was 88% (oADT) versus 81% (SOC; P = .48). RNA sequencing (n = 9) showed similar numbers of downregulated and upregulated genes between the treatment groups (fold-change = 2; false-discovery rate-adjusted P ≤ .05).

However, ethnicity-specific outcomes of targeted fusion biopsy (FB) for the detection of PCa are poorly characterized. We compared the outcomes of FB by Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS®) score and race/ethnicity among a diverse population.  Materials and methods:   We evaluated all men who underwent image-guided FB for suspicious lesions on prostate magnetic resonance imaging (≥PI-RADS 3) over a 2-year period. We examined associations of race/ethnicity and PI-RADS score with risk of PCa or clinically significant PCa (cs-PCa, Gleason Group ≥2) on FB using mixed-effects logistic regression models.  Results:   A total of 410 men with 658 lesions were analyzed, with 201 (49.0%) identified as NHB and 125 (30.5%) identified as Hispanic. NHB men had a twofold increase in the odds of detecting cs-PCa (OR=2.7, p=0.045), while Hispanic men had similar odds of detecting cs-PCa compared to NHW men. With regard to all PCa, NHB men had a similar increase in the odds of detecting all PCa (OR=2.4, p=0.050), which was borderline statistically significant compared to NHW men on FB. When we excluded men on active surveillance, NHB men had even stronger associations with detection of cs-PCa (OR=3.10, p=0.047) or all PCa (OR=2.77, p=0.032) compared to NHW men.

Methods:   The authors downloaded GSE6752, GSE6919, and GSE32269 from the Gene Expression Omnibus and employed integrated analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between mPCa and PCa. Functional and pathway-enrichment analyses were performed, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and modules were constructed. Clinical mPCa specimens were collected to verify the results by performing RT-qPCR. The Cancer Genome Atlas database was used to conduct a survival analysis, and an immunohistochemical assay was performed. The invasion ability of PCa cells was verified by Transwell assay.  Results:   One-hundred six consistently DEGs were found in mPCa compared with PCa. DEGs significantly enriched the positive regulation of cell proliferation, cell division, and cell adhesion in small cell lung cancer and PCa. Cell division, nucleoplasm, and cell cycle were selected from the PPI network, and the top 10 hub genes were selected. CDC20 and PTTG1 with genetic alterations were significantly associated with poorer disease-free survival. Immunohistochemical assay results showed that the expression levels of CDC20 and PTTG1 in mPCa were higher than those in PCa. The results of the migration assay indicated that CDC20 and PTTG1 could enhance the migration ability of PCa cells.

Prostate specific antigen (PSA) changes, suspicious lesions on mpMRI and histopathological findings on biopsy were analyzed. A multivariable regression model was created for adverse pathological findings (APF) at S-RP specimen. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to determine oncological outcomes.  Results:   A total of 90 men were included. Cancer relapse after FT was detected at a median of 12 months (IQR 9-16). Of 50 men initially under AS 13 received S-RP or S-RT. In total, 44 men underwent S-RP and 13 S-RT. At cancer relapse 17 men (38.6%) in the S-RP group [S-RT n = 4 (30.8%); AS n = 3 (6%)] had ISUP > 2. APF (pT ≥ 3, ISUP ≥ 3, pN + or R1) were observed in 23 men (52.3%). A higher ISUP on biopsy was associated with APF [p = 0.006 (HR 2.32, 97.5% CI 1.35-4.59)] on univariable analysis. Progression-free survival was 80.4% after S-RP and 100% after S-RT at 3 years. Secondary therapy-free survival was 41.7% at 3 years in men undergoing AS.

Cell culture on PC-3 (human prostate adenocarcinoma), and HCT-116 (human colorectal carcinoma) were conducted following by MTT assays in addition to annexin flow cytometry for sole and synergistic effects with peptide nisin. Results: Viable and active neutrophils could recover, and α-defensins were extracted and purified. Combinations of an optimal dose of α-defensins and nisin showed a remarkable synergistic effect on cancer cell lines (over 90% and 70% for PC-3 and HCT-116, respectively).

To obtain better efficacy, a growing interest has been attracted to develop such emerging treatments as immunotherapy and focal therapy. However, few studies offer guidance on whether and how to combine these modalities against PCa. This study was designed to develop dual-functional nanoparticles (NPs) which combined photothermal therapy (PTT) with immunotherapy and determine the anti-tumor efficacy for PCa treatment.  Methods:   By a double emulsion technique, the drug nanocarrier, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) or PLGA, was applied for co-loading of a fluorescent dye, indocyanine green (ICG) and a toll-like receptor 7/8 (TLR7/8) agonist resiquimod (R848) to synthesize PLGA-ICG-R848 NPs. Next, we determined their characteristic features and evaluated whether they inhibited the cell viability in multiple PCa cell lines. After treatment with PLGA-ICG-R848, the maturation markers of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were detected by flow cytometry. By establishing a subcutaneous xenograft model of mouse PCa, we explored both the anti-tumor effect and immune response following the NPs-based laser ablation.  Results:   With a mean diameter of 157.7 nm, PLGA-ICG-R848 exhibited no cytotoxic effect in PCa cells, but they significantly decreased RM9 cell viability to (3.9±1.0)% after laser irradiation. Moreover, PLGA-ICG-R848 promoted BMDCs maturation with the significantly elevated proportions of CD11c+CD86+ and CD11c+CD80+ cells. Following PLGA-ICG-R848-based laser ablation in vivo, the decreased bioluminescent signals indicated a significant inhibition of PCa growth, while the ratio of splenic natural killer (NK) cells in PLGA-ICG-R848 was (3.96±1.88)% compared with (0.99±0.10)% in PBS group, revealing the enhanced immune response against PCa.

Methods:   Participants in the present study were 324 consecutive patients with localized prostate cancer who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy between February 2013 and June 2018. Positive surgical margins were diagnosed in 61 of them. Patients with positive surgical margins were divided into those with (n = 19) and those without (n = 42) biochemical recurrence. Lymph node dissection, estimated blood loss, inhalation anesthetic volume, and surgical duration were evaluated as indicators of surgical stress. White blood cell count, C-reactive protein, body temperature, and usage of analgesics were postoperatively evaluated as surrogate markers of surgical stress. The associations between factors, including patients' characteristics and pathological features, and biochemical recurrence were investigated.

However, the prognostic value of miR-219-5p for patients with prostate cancer remains unclear.  Methods:   We retrospectively analysed data from 213 prostate cancer patients from 10 June 2012 to 9 May 2015. Overall survival was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression models. Besides, a prediction model was constructed, and calibration curves evaluated the model's accuracy.  Results:   Of the 213 patients, a total of 72 (33.8%) died and the median survival time was 60.0 months. We found by multifactorial analysis that miR-219-5p deficiency increased the risk of death by nearly fourfold (HR: 3.86, 95% CI): 2.01 to 7.44, p<0.001) and the risk of progression by twofold (HR: 2.79, 95% CI: 1.68 to 4.64, p<0.001). To quantify each covariate's weight on prognosis, we screened variables by cox model to construct a predictive model. The Nomogram showed excellent accuracy in estimating death's risk, with a corrected C-index of 0.778.  Conclusions:   miR-219-5p can be used as a biomarker to predict death risk in prostate cancer patients. The mortality risk prediction model constructed based on miR-219-5p has good consistency and validity in assessing patient prognosis.""","""['Shimin Tang', 'Hao Jiang', 'Zhijun Cao', 'Qiang Zhou']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Postgrad Med J""","""['Prognostic value of miR-219-5p in relation to mortality in patients with small cell lung cancer: a retrospective, observational cohort study in China.', 'High expression of miR-17-5p in tumor epithelium is a predictor for poor prognosis for prostate cancer patients.', 'miR-21-5p, miR-141-3p, and miR-205-5p levels in urine-promising biomarkers for the identification of prostate and bladder cancer.', 'Assessment of miR-98-5p, miR-152-3p, miR-326 and miR-4289 Expression as Biomarker for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'The potential of microRNAs as human prostate cancer biomarkers: A meta-analysis of related studies.']"""

However, the joint effects of TTh and statins use on the incidence of prostate cancer, stage and grade at diagnosis, and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) have not been studied.We identified White (N = 74,181), Black (N = 9,157), and Hispanic (N = 3,313) men diagnosed with prostate cancer in SEER-Medicare 2007-2016. Prediagnostic prescription of TTh and statins was ascertained for this analysis. Weighted multivariable-adjusted conditional logistic and Cox proportional hazards models evaluated the association of TTh and statins with prostate cancer, including statistical interactions between TTh and statins.We found that TTh (OR = 0.74; 95% CI, 0.68-0.81) and statins (OR = 0.77; 95% CI, 0.0.75-0.88) were inversely associated with incident prostate cancer. Similar inverse associations were observed with high-grade and advanced prostate cancer in relation to TTh and statins use. TTh plus statins was inversely associated with incident prostate cancer (OR = 0.53; 95% CI, 0.48-0.60), high-grade (OR = 0.43; 95% CI, 0.37-0.49), and advanced prostate cancer (OR = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.35-0.55). Similar associations were present in White and Black men, but among Hispanics statins were associated with PCSM.Prediagnostic use of TTh or statins, independent or combined, was inversely associated with incident and aggressive prostate cancer overall and in NHW and NHB men. Findings for statins and aggressive prostate cancer are consistent with previous studies. Future studies need to confirm the independent inverse association of TTh and the joint inverse association of TTh plus statins on risk of prostate cancer in understudied populations. PREVENTION RELEVANCE: The study investigates a potential interaction between TTh and statin and its effect on incident and aggressive prostate cancer in men of different racial and ethnic backgrounds. These results suggest that among NHW and non-Hispanic Black men TTh plus statins reduced the odds of incident prostate cancer, high-grade and advance stage prostate cancer.""","""['David S Lopez', 'Efstathia Polychronopoulou', 'Konstantinos K Tsilidis', 'Mohit Khera', 'L Joseph Su', 'Jay H Fowke', 'M K Peek', 'Yong-Fang Kuo', 'Kyriakos Markides', 'Steven Canfield']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Prev Res (Phila)""","""['Joint association of statins and testosterone replacement therapy with cardiovascular disease among older men with prostate cancer: SEER-Medicare 2007-2015.', 'The role of testosterone replacement therapy and statin use, and their combination, in prostate cancer.', 'Metformin and testosterone replacement therapy inversely associated with hormone-associated cancers (prostate, colorectal and male breast cancers) among older White and Black men.', 'Do African American men have lower survival from prostate cancer compared with White men?

Methods:   Ten patients aged 66 ± 7 years received a 6.5 ± 3.2 mCi intravenous injection of [18F]-BF3-Cy3-ACUPA and underwent PET/computed tomography (CT) imaging. Radiation dosimetry of [18F]-BF3-Cy3-ACUPA, normal organ biodistribution, and tumor uptakes were examined. Two patients were prescheduled for radical prostatectomy (RP) with extended pelvic lymphadenectomy approximately 24 hours following [18F]-BF3-Cy3-ACUPA injection and imaging. Without reinjection, intraoperative fluorescence imaging was performed on freshly excised tissue during RP. Frozen sections of excised tissue during RP were submitted for confirmatory histopathology and multiphoton fluorescence and brightfield microscopy.  Results:   Absorbed doses by organs including the kidneys and salivary glands were similar to 68Ga-PSMA-11 imaging. [18F]-BF3-Cy3-ACUPA physiologic radiotracer accumulation and urinary/biliary excretion closely resembled the distribution of other published PSMA tracers including [18F]-JK-PSMA-7, [18F]-PSMA-1007, [18F]-DCFPyL, and [18F]-DCFBC. 19F-BF3-Cy3-ACUPA was retained in PSMA+ cancer tissues in patients for at least 24 hours, allowing for intraoperative fluorescence assessment of the prostate and of the embedded prostate cancer without contrast reinjection. After 24 hours, the imaging agent mostly decayed or cleared from the blood pool. Preoperative PET and fluorescence imaging findings were confirmed with final histopathology and multiphoton microscopy.  Conclusion:   Our first-in-human results demonstrate that [18F]-BF3-Cy3-ACUPA is safe and feasible in humans.

This would prompt the implementation of measures aimed at reducing the risk of adverse outcomes.  Objective:   To assess the efficacy of an audit and feedback process aimed at identifying the most common complications after RARP and at implementing measures to improve outcomes.  Design, setting, and participants:   Overall, 415 patients treated with RARP by a high-volume surgeon were included. Perioperative outcomes for 187 patients treated between September 2016 and December 2017 were prospectively collected at 30 d according to the European Association of Urology guideline recommendations (group 1). An audit and feedback process was implemented in January 2018 whereby the most common complication (anastomotic leak) was identified and measures aimed at improving outcomes (changes in the anastomotic technique) were implemented. The outcomes for group 1 were then compared to 228 patients treated after implementation of the modified surgical technique (group 2).  Surgical procedure:   A novel technique for posterior reconstruction and urethrovesical anastomosis was introduced.  Measurements:   Perioperative outcomes included blood loss, operative time, length of stay, and 30-d postoperative complications. Logistic regression models tested the effect of the novel surgical technique on anastomotic leaks.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 97 patients (23%) experienced postoperative complications at 30 d. The rate of anastomotic leaks was significantly lower in group 2 compared to group 1 (3.1% vs 9.6%; p < 0.01). Similarly, overall and Clavien-Dindo grade ≥2 complication rates were lower in group 2 versus group 1 (17% vs 31%, and 6% vs 20%; both p ≤ 0.001). In multivariable analyses, treatment after implementation of changes in the anastomotic technique independently predicted a lower risk of complications (odds ratio [OR] 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.38-0.89) and of anastomotic leaks (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.17-0.97). The lack of randomization represents the main limitation.  Conclusions:   Implementation of changes in the urethrovesical anastomosis technique arising from increased awareness of surgical outcomes reduced the risk of anastomotic leaks. These findings highlight the importance of audit and feedback processes using a standardized method for reporting surgical morbidity.

The potential impact of beliefs and perceptions about PC among Black and Latino populations on clinical disparities are not well understood. This qualitative study was conducted to assess current prevalent and pervasive stigma, beliefs and perceptions regarding PC among Blacks and Latinos living in a large metropolitan area, thereby identifying potentially modifiable barriers to care.  Methods:   Qualitative data were collected through four separate focus groups of self-identified Black and Latino adult men and women living in Philadelphia to better understand their perceptions of PC diagnosis, screening and treatment. Each focus group was single-sex and conducted by racial/ethnic group in order to assess possible differences in beliefs about PC based on gender and racial/ethnic affiliation. Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim by trained research assistants and qualitative data analysis was conducted using modified grounded theory.  Results:   There were a total of 34 participants: 19 Hispanics/Latinos and 15 Blacks, with equal numbers of men and women (n=17). Median age was 57 years (range: 18 to 85 years). Dominant themes that emerged with respect to PC diagnosis included the stigma surrounding this condition and the perceived role of an ""unhealthy lifestyle"" and certain sexual behaviors as risk factors for PC development. While the majority of participants acknowledged the importance of PC screening and early detection, discussion centered around the barriers to both the interest in seeking medical care and the likelihood of securing it. These barriers included misunderstanding of PC etiology, distrust of the medical profession, and financial/access limitations. Men expressed substantial confusion about PC screening guidelines. In the Black female group, the role of faith and religion in the course of disease was a major theme. Both Black and Latina females discussed the role of fear and avoidance around PC screening and treatment, as well as the prevalence of misinformation about PC in their familial and social communities.  Conclusion:   Black and Latino focus groups revealed the existence of cultural beliefs, misunderstandings and fears pertaining to PC which could influence health-related behaviors. Some themes were common across groups; others suggested racial and gender predilections. Future targeted efforts focused on directly addressing prevalent misperceptions among underserved communities in urban settings could help to improve health literacy and equity in PC outcomes in these populations.""","""['Neha Vapiwala', 'David Miller', 'Brenda Laventure', 'Kristina Woodhouse', 'Sheila Kelly', 'Jade Avelis', 'Cordelia Baffic', 'Rodney Goldston', 'Karen Glanz']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BMC Public Health""","""['Characterizing Beliefs about Stroke and Walking for Exercise among Seniors from Four Racial/Ethnic Minority Communities.', 'Exploring behavioral intervention components for African American/Black and Latino persons living with HIV with non-suppressed HIV viral load in the United States: a qualitative study.', 'Exploring beliefs about prostate cancer and early detection in men and women of three ethnic groups.', 'Prostate cancer disparities in South Carolina: early detection, special programs, and descriptive epidemiology.', 'Perceptions of prostate cancer in Black African and Black Caribbean men: a systematic review of the literature.', 'Barriers, facilitators, and priority needs related to cancer prevention, control, and research in rural, persistent poverty areas.', 'Racial disparities in Black men with prostate cancer: A literature review.', '""Being proactive, not reactive"": exploring perceptions of genetic testing among White, Latinx, and Pacific Islander\xa0Populations.']"""

Accurate prostate segmentation on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is critical for accurate biopsy. Manual gland segmentation is tedious and time-consuming. We sought to develop a deep learning model to rapidly and accurately segment the prostate on MRI and to implement it as part of routine magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy in the clinic.  Materials and methods:   A total of 905 subjects underwent multiparametric MRI at 29 institutions, followed by magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy at 1 institution. A urologic oncology expert segmented the prostate on axial T2-weighted MRI scans. We trained a deep learning model, ProGNet, on 805 cases. We retrospectively tested ProGNet on 100 independent internal and 56 external cases. We prospectively implemented ProGNet as part of the fusion biopsy procedure for 11 patients. We compared ProGNet performance to 2 deep learning networks (U-Net and holistically-nested edge detector) and radiology technicians. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was used to measure overlap with expert segmentations. DSCs were compared using paired t-tests.  Results:   ProGNet (DSC=0.92) outperformed U-Net (DSC=0.85, p <0.0001), holistically-nested edge detector (DSC=0.80, p <0.0001), and radiology technicians (DSC=0.89, p <0.0001) in the retrospective internal test set. In the prospective cohort, ProGNet (DSC=0.93) outperformed radiology technicians (DSC=0.90, p <0.0001).

Methods: A total of 92 patients with low to intermediate-risk prostate cancer who underwent RARP (n=52) and RsRARP (n=40) in Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital from October, 2016 to January, 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Perioperative data (operative time, estimated blood loss, complications, postoperative staging, postoperative Gleason score) and surgical outcomes (rate of margin positive, urinary continence recovery time) of RARP and RsRARP group were comparatively analyzed. Results: All 92 cases were successfully performed with robot. RARP group had a significantly shorter mean operative time when compared with that in RsRARP group ((103±23) min vs (130±26) min, P<0.05). The two groups had comparable estimated blood loss ((100±54) ml vs (103±64) ml, P>0.05), rate of postoperative infection (5.8% (3/52) vs 5.0% (2/40), P>0.05) and rate of postoperative urine leakage (3.8%(2/52) vs 2.5%(1/40), P>0.05). The two groups had a comparable rate of margin positive (7.7%(4/52) vs 12.5%(5/40), P>0.05). Compared with RsRARP group, the RARP group had a lower rate of urinary continence recovery immediately after the catheter removing at 1 week, 1 month and 3 months after the operation (all P>0.05). The two group had a comparable rate of urinary continence recovery at 6 months after the operation (P>0.05).

Methods: A descriptive case series study was performed. The complete clinical data of 62 patients who met the diagnostic criteria of LRRC and treated by surgical procedures in Huashan Hospital of Fudan University from January 2012 to November 2019 were analyzed retrospectively. All the patients were followed up at least 12 months. Assessments of urinary function, sexual function, mobility function of lower limb and quality of life were documented. Patients with distant metastasis and surgical history of the urinary system were excluded. According to the criteria of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), recurrence were divided into central (n=27), anterior (n=20), posterior (n=7), and lateral (n=8) subtypes. Baseline characteristics, surgical procedures and short-term complications were analyzed. International prostate symptom score (IPSS) and grade of voiding dysfunction were used to evaluate the urinary function. Higher score of IPSS and higher grade of voiding dysfunction indicated worse voiding function. Sexual function for both genders was assessed preoperatively and postoperatively. International index of erectile function-5 (IIEF-5) was used for assessment of male patients and higher score indicated better function. Female sexual function index (FSFI) was used in females and higher score indicated better function. Short-form health survey with 36 items (SF-36), yielding an 8-scale profile of functional health (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional health and mental health) was used to evaluate the quality of life. The higher score indicated the better quality of life. Results: All the operations of 62 patients completed successfully and R0 resection rate was 88.7% (55/62). Postoperative surgical complications occurred in 16 cases (25.8%), including 3 patients of Clavien-Dindo classification III. At postoperative 3-month, 42 patients without ileum cystectomy or ureterostomy suffered from different grade of voiding dysfunction. IPSS increased significantly after the surgery (before surgery: 12.36±4.75, after surgery: 18.40±4.77, t=-9.128, P<0.001). There was no significant difference among the subtypes (P>0.05). At postoperative 12-month, IIEF-5 decreased from 14 (0~25) to 9 (0~19) in males (Z=-5.174, P<0.001) and FSFI deceased from 8.4 (2.0-27.0) to 2.0 (2.0-18.4) in females (Z=-3.522, P<0.001). Scores of physical functioning and role-physical decreased significantly [physical functioning: before surgery 70 (35-85), after surgery 65 (30-80), Z=-3.685, P<0.001; role-physical: before surgery 50 (0-50), after surgery 25(0-75), Z=-4.065, P<0.001], while those of social functioning role-emotional and mental health increased significantly after the surgery [social functioning: before surgery 44 (22-78), after surgery 56 (0-89), Z=-3.509, P<0.001; role-emotional: before surgery 17 (0-100), after surgery 33 (0-100), Z=-2.439, P=0.015; mental health: before surgery 40 (36-76), after surgery 52 (24-80), Z=-3.395, P<0.001]. All surgical procedures decreased the voiding function of LRRC patients and the sexual function of male patients (all P<0.01). However, only total pelvic exenteration and posterior pelvic exenteration decreased FSFI in female patients [before surgery: 8.4 (2.0-27.0) after surgery: 2.0 (2.0-18.4), Z=-2.810, P=0.005].

Methods:   Data on prostate biopsies and outcomes were collected from the Pennsylvania Urologic Regional Collaborative, a regional quality collaborative working to improve the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. Patients were categorized as receiving one of three prophylaxis pathways: culture-directed, augmented, or provider-discretion. Infectious complications included fever, urinary tract infections or sepsis within one month of biopsy. Odds ratios of infectious complication by pathway were determined, and univariate and multivariate analyses of patient and biopsy characteristics were performed.  Results:   11,940 biopsies were included, 120 of which resulted in infectious outcomes. Of the total biopsies, 3246 used ""culture-directed"", 1446 used ""augmented"" and 7207 used ""provider-discretion"" prophylaxis. Compared to provider-discretion, the culture-directed pathway had 84% less chance of any infectious outcome (OR= 0.159, 95% CI = [0.074, 0.344], P < 0.001). There was no difference in infectious complications between augmented and provider-discretion pathways.  Conclusions:   The culture-directed pathway for transrectal prostate biopsy resulted in significantly fewer infectious complications compared to other prophylaxis strategies.

The abnormal activation of JAK2/STAT3/MCL-1 and NF-κB has been confirmed as the main reason for the development of CRPC. We previously found that β-elemonic acid (β-EA) as a natural triterpene has potential anti-inflammatory and anti-osteosarcoma effects with lower toxicity. But it remains unknown whether it had effects on CRPC. The present research in vitro and in vivo systematically investigates anti-cancer effects and mechanisms of β-EA on human CRPC. β-EA treatment resulted in apoptotic cell death in human PCa cells by mitochondrial apoptotic pathways (including up-regulation of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP, and Bax or down-regulation of Bcl-2). Besides, β-EA at relatively lower levels inhibited colony-forming, the migration and invasion potential of PCa cells, indicating its anti-proliferation and anti-metastasis activities. After exploring the potential mechanism, our results suggested that it subsequently inhibited the activation of JAK2/STAT3/MCL-1 and NF-κB signaling pathway by the administration of β-EA. The silencing of NF-κB/p65, JAK2 and STAT3, respectively, increased the sensitivity of the PCa cells to β-EA induced apoptosis. Moreover, β-EA exhibited a strong affinity with its essential proteins JAK2, RELA/p65, NF-κBIα/IκBα by molecular docking analysis. Importantly, β-EA retards tumor growth in a murine xenograft model, consistent with our study in vitro.

Using several approaches, including parabiosis and an evolving barcode system, we demonstrated that the bone microenvironment facilitates breast and prostate cancer cells to further metastasize and establish multi-organ secondary metastases. We uncovered that this metastasis-promoting effect is driven by epigenetic reprogramming that confers stem cell-like properties on cancer cells disseminated from bone lesions. Furthermore, we discovered that enhanced EZH2 activity mediates the increased stemness and metastasis capacity. The same findings also apply to single cell-derived populations, indicating mechanisms distinct from clonal selection.

We aimed to assess the impact of giant PV on HRQOL and functional outcomes for men with prostate cancer (PC) undergoing RP.  Methods:   Giant PV was defined based on the 95th percentile of PV measured by specimen weight of 3929 patients that underwent RP between 2013 and 2018 in a large tertiary care center. A propensity score-matched analysis of 929 men treated with RP for PC (n = 184 with PV ≥ 100 cm3 , n = 745 with PV < 100 cm3 ) was conducted. Primary endpoint was the impact of giant PV on HRQOL (based on EORTC QLQ-C30) assessed with binary logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard model. Secondary endpoint was the impact of PV on oncological- and functional outcome.  Results:   Median follow-up was 24 months. Median PV, measured by specimen-weight, was 58 cm3 . We found no significant differences in median general HRQOL (p = .183), giant PV was not associated with better HRQOL (odds ratio [OR], 1.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.96-2.47; p = .075). No significant differences were found regarding continence recovery (hazard ratio [HR], 0.956; 95% CI, 0.771-1.185; p = .682), median International Consultation of Incontinence Questionnaire-Short-Form (ICIQ-SF) scores (p = .062) or potency rates (p = .151). Giant PV did not significantly impair biochemical recurrence-free survival (HR, 0.968; 95% CI, 0.651-1.439; p = .871).  Conclusions:   For patients undergoing RP, giant PV was not associated with adverse HRQOL outcomes.

Methods:   A total of 268 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with chronotype were selected from a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of 697,828 individuals. The genetic association data for prostate cancer was derived from the Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer-Associated Alterations in the Genome (PRACTICAL) Consortium (79,148 cases and 61,106 controls). Inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was used as the primary analysis to calculate the causal effect estimates.

Results:   Genetically predicted morningness (scaled to a sleep midpoint of 1 h earlier) had a reduced risk of prostate cancer, with an odds ratio of 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.54-0.94 by IVW), compared with the eveningness. Similar causal effect estimates were also observed by using the weighted median and MR-PRESSO analyses. In addition, results from the multivariable MR analysis supported the findings from the univariable MR analyses.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of Fluxonorm® in improving lower urinary tract symptoms in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in combination with standard of care.  Patients and methods:   Lower urinary tract symptoms can be improved by a marked anti-inflammatory action on the lower urinary tract (irritative symptoms) and/or by an anti-proliferative action (obstructive symptoms) on the prostate. Thirty patients were enrolled to evaluate the effect of Fluxonorm® on improving lower urinary tract symptoms. All patients complained of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), such as hesitancy, poor flow, intermittent flow, incomplete voiding (obstructive symptoms), as well as increased frequency, nocturia and urgency (storage symptoms). All patients were treated with one tablet of Fluxonorm® (1200 mg) daily for 30 days to corroborate the results of our observation in which the food supplement (800 µg/mL) was also studied on the human prostate cancer PC3 cell line (antiproliferative activity) and on prostaglandin (PG)E2 production (anti-inflammatory activity).

Finally, a bioinformatic analysis was conducted with the aim of unravelling the mechanism of action underlying the observed bio-pharmacological effects.  Results:   As hypothesized in our preclinical research, adding Fluxonorm® to the therapy of enrolled patients improved all studied clinical parameters, including maximum flow (Qmax), after one month of treatment. In the preclinical evaluation, this formulation reduced PC3 cell viability and PGE2 production. The effects were also paralleled by reduced COX-2 gene expression and Fluxonorm®'s partly related content of catechin. While docking studies pointed out to the putative inhibition of matrix metalloproteinse-2 by gallic acid, as a further mechanism underlying the observed anti-proliferative effects, in PC3 cells exposed to Fluxonorm®.

Our results show that cancer-induced changes are reflected in higher urinary [Zn] and lower urinary δ66Zn for pancreatic and prostate cancer and benign breast disease when compared with healthy controls. For prostate cancer, the progression of low [Zn] and high δ66Zn for patients of low-risk disease toward high [Zn] and low δ66Zn for the higher risk patients demonstrates that [Zn] and δ66Zn in urine could serve as a reliable prognostic tool. Urinary excretion of isotopically light Zn by patients with prostatic and pancreatic cancer is probably the result of increased reactive oxygen species in cancerous cells, which limits the scavenging of hydroxyl radicals and thus facilitates the oxidation of metalloproteins with sulfur-rich ligands. Urine from breast cancer patients shows undistinguishable δ66Zn to healthy controls, implying that the expression of metalloproteins with sulfur-rich ligands is stronger in breast cancer tissues. In conclusion, urinary δ66Zn may provide a non-invasive diagnostic tool for pancreatic cancer and support disease prognosis for prostate cancer. These findings should translate to comprehensive transverse and longitudinal cohort studies in future.""","""['Kathrin Schilling', 'Rebekah E T Moore', 'Kaj V Sullivan', 'Miles S Capper', 'Mark Rehkämper', 'Kate Goddard', 'Charlotte Ion', 'R Charles Coombes', 'Lois Vesty-Edwards', 'Alastair D Lamb', 'Alex N Halliday', 'Fiona Larner']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Metallomics""","""['Zinc stable isotope analysis reveals Zn dyshomeostasis in benign tumours, breast cancer, and adjacent histologically normal tissue.', 'Urine metallomics signature as an indicator of pancreatic cancer.', 'Assessment of coupled Zn concentration and natural stable isotope analyses of urine as a novel probe of Zn status.', 'Medical applications of Cu, Zn, and S isotope effects.', '-The advancement of biomarker-based diagnostic tools for ovarian, breast, and pancreatic cancer through the use of urine as an analytical biofluid.', 'A Systematic Study on Zinc-Related Metabolism in Breast Cancer.', 'Isotopic composition of serum zinc and copper in healthy children and children with autism spectrum disorder in North America.', 'Zincon-Modified CNTs Electrochemical Tool for Salivary and Urinary Zinc Detection.', 'Zinc in Prostate Health and Disease: A Mini Review.', 'Investigations on Zinc Isotope Fractionation in Breast Cancer Tissue Using in vitro Cell Culture Uptake-Efflux Experiments.']"""

Consensus statements recommend eligibility criteria based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-targeted and systematic combination biopsy.  Objective:   To estimate the future potential of FT by analyzing the number of men eligible for FT among all men with biopsy-proven PCa and to judge the potential of different energy sources.  Design, setting, and participants:   Consensus criteria on FT were analyzed. Patients with biopsy-proven PCa from six tertiary referral hospitals and one outpatient practice in Germany had received a software-based combination biopsy. Men with Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) ≥3 lesions based on PI-RADS v2 were included.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Patients were analyzed for potential treatment by FT and hemiablation. MRI lesions were mapped according to prostatic zones.  Results and limitations:   In total, 2371 patients were analyzed. According to consensus criteria (biopsy-proven unifocal lesion of International Society of Urological Pathology [ISUP] grade group ≤2, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] ≤15ng/mL, and life expectancy >10yr), 303 patients (12.8%; ISUP 1: n=148 [6.2%]; ISUP 2: n=155 [6.5%]) were potential candidates for FT. A maximum PSA level of <10ng/mL would exclude further 60 (2.5%) of these men. The eligibility for hemiablation is slightly higher (16.2%). Unifocal lesions (n=288) were equally distributed within the prostate (anteriorly [31%], apically [29%], and dorsally [36%]).  Conclusions:   With adherence to consensus statements, only a minority of PCa patients present as potential candidates for FT. Distribution of tumor localization suggests the need for different energy modalities to warrant an optimal FT treatment.  Patient summary:   We analyzed how many men who receive a magnetic resonance imaging-targeted and systematic prostate biopsy are candidates for the experimental focal therapy of the prostate.

Constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway has been linked to chemoresistance and metastatic progression through distinct mechanisms, including activation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) when cells adopt a motile and invasive phenotype through loss of epithelial markers (CDH1), and acquisition of mesenchymal markers (VIM, CDH2). Although MAPK/ERK1/2 kinase inhibitors (MEKi) are useful antitumor agents in a clinical setting, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved MEK1,2 dual inhibitors cobimetinib and trametinib, there are limitations to their clinical utility, primarily adaptation of the BRAF pathway and ocular toxicities. The MEK5 (HGNC: MAP2K5) pathway has important roles in metastatic progression of various cancer types, including those of the prostate, colon, bone and breast, and elevated levels of ERK5 expression in breast carcinomas are linked to a worse prognoses in TNBC patients. The purpose of this study is to explore MEK5 regulation of the EMT axis and to evaluate a novel pan-MEK inhibitor on clinically aggressive TNBC cells. Our results show a distinction between the MEK1/2 and MEK5 cascades in maintenance of the mesenchymal phenotype, suggesting that the MEK5 pathway may be necessary and sufficient in EMT regulation while MEK1/2 signaling further sustains the mesenchymal state of TNBC cells. Furthermore, additive effects on MET induction are evident through the inhibition of both MEK1/2 and MEK5. Taken together, these data demonstrate the need for a better understanding of the individual roles of MEK1/2 and MEK5 signaling in breast cancer and provide a rationale for the combined targeting of these pathways to circumvent compensatory signaling and subsequent therapeutic resistance.""","""['Van T Hoang', 'Margarite D Matossian', 'Jacqueline La', 'Kristine Hoang', 'Deniz A Ucar', 'Steven Elliott', 'Hope E Burks', 'Thomas D Wright', 'Saloni Patel', 'Akshita Bhatt', 'Theresa Phamduy', 'Douglas Chrisey', 'Aaron Buechlein', 'Douglas B Rusch', 'Kenneth P Nephew', 'Murali Anbalagan', 'Brian Rowan', 'Jane E Cavanaugh', 'Patrick T Flaherty', 'Lucio Miele', 'Bridgette M Collins-Burow', 'Matthew E Burow']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['Pharmacological inhibition of the MEK5/ERK5 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways synergistically reduces viability in triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Proteomic analysis of tumor necrosis factor-alpha resistant human breast cancer cells reveals a MEK5/Erk5-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype.', 'Upregulation of MEK5 by Stat3 promotes breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis.', 'MEK5/ERK5 pathway: the first fifteen years.', 'Oncogenic signaling of MEK5-ERK5.', 'YWHAH activates the HMGA1/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway by positively regulating Fra-1 to affect the proliferation of gastric cancer cells.', 'The Predictive and Prognostic Role of RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK Pathway Alterations in Breast Cancer: Revision of the Literature and Comparison with the Analysis of Cancer Genomic Datasets.', 'Quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis reveals chemoresistance-related proteins and signaling pathways induced by rhIL-6 in human osteosarcoma cells.', 'The MEK5/ERK5 Pathway in Health and Disease.']"""

Procedures:   The LNCaP, PC-3 cell lines with high FASN expression, and DU145 cell lines with low FASN expression were selected for cell culture. A PET imaging comparison of [18F]FDG and [18F]FPA was performed in LNCaP, PC-3, and DU145 tumors. Additionally, in vivo inhibition experiments in those models were conducted with orlistat. In a human PET study, a patient with PCa before surgery was examined with [18F]FPA PET and [18F]FDG PET.  Results:   The uptake of [18F]FPA in the LNCaP and PC-3 tumors was higher than that of [18F]FDG (P<0.05 and P<0.05), but was lower in DU145 tumors (P<0.05). The accumulation (% ID/g) of [18F]FPA in the LNCaP, PC-3, and DU145 tumors decreased by 27.6, 40.5, and 11.7 %, respectively, after treatment with orlistat. The [18F]FPA showed higher radioactive uptake than [18F]FDG in the first PCa patient.  Conclusions:   The [18F]FPA uptake in PCa models may be varies with fatty acid synthase activity and could be reduced after administration of a single FASN inhibitor, albeit the activity that is not measured directly.

Aim:   To develop and validate an equation to predict absolute risk of prostate cancer in asymptomatic men with prostate specific antigen (PSA) tests in primary care.  Design and setting:   Cohort study using data from English general practices, held in the QResearch database.  Method:   Routine data were collected from 1098 QResearch English general practices linked to mortality, hospital, and cancer records for model development. Two separate sets of practices were used for validation. In total, there were 844 455 men aged 25-84 years with PSA tests recorded who were free of prostate cancer at baseline in the derivation cohort; the validation cohorts comprised 292 084 and 316 583 men. The primary outcome was incident prostate cancer. Cox proportional hazards models were used to derive 10-year risk equations. Measures of performance were determined in both validation cohorts.  Results:   There were 40 821 incident cases of prostate cancer in the derivation cohort. The risk equation included PSA level, age, deprivation, ethnicity, smoking status, serious mental illness, diabetes, BMI, and family history of prostate cancer. The risk equation explained 70.4% (95% CI = 69.2 to 71.6) of the variation in time to diagnosis of prostate cancer (R2) (D statistic 3.15, 95% CI = 3.06 to 3.25; Harrell's C-index 0.917, 95% CI = 0.915 to 0.919). Two-step approach had higher sensitivity than a fixed PSA threshold at identifying prostate cancer cases (identifying 68.2% versus 43.9% of cases), high-grade cancers (49.2% versus 40.3%), and deaths (67.0% versus 31.5%).

However, this cure comes at a cost for many patients, where late bowel toxicities, such as faecal incontinence, urgency and diarrhoea, adversely affect quality of life. Despite the implementation of advanced radiotherapy techniques in many centres, there are deficiencies in our knowledge of how to make best use of these techniques to minimise these late toxicities, with dose-volume constraints specifically for late effects needing definition. The aims of this study were to establish dose-volume predictors for patient-reported late bowel toxicities and derive constraints for clinical use to reduce the risk of these toxicities.  Materials and methods:   All radiotherapy patients treated in our institution between 2012 and 2014 for gynaecological and urological cancers (bladder, prostate where pelvic nodes are treated) were identified. Patients were sent patient-reported toxicity questionnaires at 12 and 24 months after treatment. Planning computed tomography scans were retrospectively contoured with different definitions of bowel as organs at risk (OARs). Dose-volume data for each OAR were collected and predictors of these toxicities found using multivariate analysis. For those dose-volume predictors found to be significant on multivariate analysis, statistically significant and clinically relevant dose-volume constraints were derived. Furthermore, data collected were used to validate constraints from published studies.  Results:   Faecal urgency, incontinence and diarrhoea rates were found in 52, 23.5 and 18.7% of the 203 patients included at 12 months following radiotherapy. Dose-volume parameters for sigmoid colon and large bowel were significant for these toxicities, and constraints for these OARs were derived, which are promising. A previously published constraint for bowel loops was validated with our data.  Conclusions:   The sigmoid colon and large bowel are important OARs for the development of faecal urgency, incontinence and diarrhoea. Promising constraints for these OARs were derived, which require further validation before prospective clinical use.""","""['R Jadon', 'L Hanna', 'P Parsons', 'J Staffurth']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol)""","""['A systematic review of dose-volume predictors and constraints for late bowel toxicity following pelvic radiotherapy.', 'Faecal incontinence: A late side-effect of pelvic radiotherapy.', 'Patient-reported intestinal toxicity from whole pelvis intensity-modulated radiotherapy: First quantification of bowel dose-volume effects.', 'Faecal incontinence following radiotherapy for prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Dose-volume effects for normal tissues in external radiotherapy: pelvis.']"""

Recently, the usefulness of Deep Learning (DL) models for lung cancer risk assessment has been demonstrated. However, in many cases model performances are evaluated on small/medium size test sets, thus not providing strong model generalization and stability guarantees which are necessary for clinical adoption. In this work, our goal is to contribute towards clinical adoption by investigating a deep learning framework on larger and heterogeneous datasets while also comparing to state-of-the-art models.  Methods:   Three low-dose CT lung cancer screening datasets were used: National Lung Screening Trial (NLST, n = 3410), Lahey Hospital and Medical Center (LHMC, n = 3154) data, Kaggle competition data (from both stages, n = 1397 + 505) and the University of Chicago data (UCM, a subset of NLST, annotated by radiologists, n = 132). At the first stage, our framework employs a nodule detector; while in the second stage, we use both the image context around the nodules and nodule features as inputs to a neural network that estimates the malignancy risk for the entire CT scan. We trained our algorithm on a part of the NLST dataset, and validated it on the other datasets. Special care was taken to ensure there was no patient overlap between the train and validation sets.  Results and conclusions:   The proposed deep learning model is shown to: (a) generalize well across all three data sets, achieving AUC between 86% to 94%, with our external test-set (LHMC) being at least twice as large compared to other works; (b) have better performance than the widely accepted PanCan Risk Model, achieving 6 and 9% better AUC score in our two test sets; (c) have improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art represented by the winners of the Kaggle Data Science Bowl 2017 competition on lung cancer screening; (d) have comparable performance to radiologists in estimating cancer risk at a patient level.""","""['Stojan Trajanovski', 'Dimitrios Mavroeidis', 'Christine Leon Swisher', 'Binyam Gebrekidan Gebre', 'Bastiaan S Veeling', 'Rafael Wiemker', 'Tobias Klinder', 'Amir Tahmasebi', 'Shawn M Regis', 'Christoph Wald', 'Brady J McKee', 'Sebastian Flacke', 'Heber MacMahon', 'Homer Pien']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Comput Med Imaging Graph""","""['Validation of a Deep Learning Algorithm for the Detection of Malignant Pulmonary Nodules in Chest Radiographs.', 'Deep Learning for Malignancy Risk Estimation of Pulmonary Nodules Detected at Low-Dose Screening CT.', 'Deep Learning Using Chest Radiographs to Identify High-Risk Smokers for Lung Cancer Screening Computed Tomography: Development and Validation of a Prediction Model.', 'A survey of computer-aided diagnosis of lung nodules from CT scans using deep learning.', 'Lung Nodule Detection from Feature Engineering to Deep Learning in Thoracic CT Images: a Comprehensive Review.', 'Recalibration of a Deep Learning Model for Low-Dose Computed Tomographic Images to Inform Lung Cancer Screening Intervals.', 'Dynamic predictions of postoperative complications from explainable, uncertainty-aware, and multi-task deep neural networks.', 'Lung CAncer SCreening in French women using low-dose CT and Artificial intelligence for DEtection: the CASCADE study protocol.', 'A Comprehensive Survey on the Progress, Process, and Challenges of Lung Cancer Detection and Classification.', 'Artificial intelligence in oncologic imaging.']"""

With an increasing incidence, there is aneed for low-cost, reliable biomarkers present in samples, which could be provided non-invasively (without a need to perform prostate biopsy). Glycosylation changes of free-PSA (fPSA) are considered cancer-specific, while the level of different PSA forms can increase under other than cancerous conditions. In the present study, we investigated the role ofN,N-diacetyllactosamine (LacdiNAc) epitope of fPSA (i.e. glycoprofile of fPSA or gPSA) in combination with total-PSA (tPSA), prostate volume, and tPSA density (tPSA level divided by prostate volume i.e. PSAd) as biomarkers for monitoring of PCa development and progression in 105 men. Furthermore, we applied an genetic (evolutionary) algorithm to identify any suspicious individuals in abenign cohort having benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). We identified 3 suspicious men originally diagnosed with BPH using gPSA analysis. In thefollow-up we found out that two men should not be considered as BPH patients since multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) identified one man with clinically significant PCa via Prostate Imaging - Reporting and Data System (PI RADS v2 = 4) and the second man was with High-gradeprostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HG PIN), commonly described as apre-cancerous stage.

First, MUC15 expression was found to be decreased in PCa tissues compared with para-carcinoma tissues. Moreover, we observed that MUC15 suppressed cell migration and invasion, both in vitro and in vivo, but had no effect on cell proliferation. Mechanistically, knockdown of MUC15 increased GSK3β phosphorylation and promoted β-catenin nuclear translocation. Therefore, the β-catenin-specific inhibitors XAV939 and PRI-724 rescued EMT in MUC15-deficient cell lines. Taken together, these results indicate that MUC15 is downregulated in PCa tissues and serves as a potential target to prevent PCa metastasis, which can inhibit EMT and cancer stemness via the GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway.""","""['Shiqi Wu', 'Yangyang Yue', 'Yanan Gu', 'Qi Wang', 'Tianjie Liu', 'Lei Li', 'Xinyang Wang', 'Luke S Chang', 'Dalin He', 'Kaijie Wu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cell Signal""","""['FERMT1 mediates epithelial-mesenchymal transition to promote colon cancer metastasis via modulation of β-catenin transcriptional activity.', 'Hsp27 regulates EGF/β-catenin mediated epithelial to mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'β-ionone Inhibits Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) in Prostate Cancer Cells by Negatively Regulating the Wnt/β-Catenin Pathway.', 'Cancer Stemness/Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Axis Influences Metastasis and Castration Resistance in Prostate Cancer: Potential Therapeutic Target.', 'The Role of Long Non-Coding RNAs in Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition-Related Signaling Pathways in Prostate Cancer.', 'Pyrogallol from Spirogyra neglecta Inhibits Proliferation and Promotes Apoptosis in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells via Modulating Akt/GSK-3β/β-catenin Signaling Pathway.', 'PD-L1/p-STAT3 promotes the progression of NSCLC cells by regulating TAM polarization.', 'Cancer associated fibroblasts secreted exosomal miR-1290 contributes to prostate cancer cell growth and metastasis via targeting GSK3β.', 'Signaling Pathways and Targeted Therapies for Stem Cells in Prostate Cancer.']"""

To face this, many herbal preparations are prescribed by traditional healers in Cameroon, among which is Anonidium mannii commonly called ""wild soursop"".  Aim:   This study was undertaken to assess the anti-tumor effect of A. mannii ethanolic extract on cancer cell growth and against DMBA-induced mammary tumors in rats.  Materials and methods:   The well characterized MTT bioassay was used to assess the cytotoxic potential of A. mannii ethanolic extract in liver (HepG2), prostate (DU145 & PC3) and breast (MCF-7) cancer cell lines. Considering the fact that breast cells were the most sensitive to the extract, a 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced breast tumor rat model was used to assess the possible anticancer effect of A. mannii extract. Indeed, rats were treated with either tamoxifen (3.3 mg/kg BW) or A. mannii extract (16.5, 50 and 150 mg/kg BW) or vehicle (2% ethanol) for 20 weeks. Tumor incidence, tumor mass and volume, oxidative stress status in tumor as well as tumor histoarchitecture were evaluated.  Results:   A 24 h incubation of tested cells with the A. mannii extract significantly slowed cell growth in a concentration-dependent manner with an interesting effect in breast cells (IC50 ~61.5 μg/mL). As compared to the DMBA rats, those treated with A. mannii extract (50 and 150 mg/kg) showed reduced breast tumor incidence (28%), tumor burden (95.34% at 50 mg/kg and 99.14% at 150 mg/kg) and tumor volume (~92%). A. mannii extract counteracted the high proliferation of terminal mammary ducts induced by DMBA, mainly at 50 mg/kg. Furthermore, the extract decreased MDA and nitrite levels but increased SOD activity in the mammary gland. High Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-MS) analysis detected potential anticancer and antioxidant alkaloids in A. manni extract, which are close to those found in Annona muricata.

This work aims to develop a deep learning-based method for male pelvic multi-organ segmentation on transrectal ultrasound images.  Methods:   We developed an anchor-free mask convolutional neural network (CNN) that consists of three subnetworks, that is, a backbone, a fully convolutional one-state object detector (FCOS), and a mask head. The backbone extracts multi-level and multi-scale features from an ultrasound (US) image. The FOCS utilizes these features to detect and label (classify) the volume-of-interests (VOIs) of organs. In contrast to the design of a previously investigated mask regional CNN (Mask R-CNN), the FCOS is anchor-free, which can capture the spatial correlation of multiple organs. The mask head performs segmentation on each detected VOI, where a spatial attention strategy is integrated into the mask head to focus on informative feature elements and suppress noise. For evaluation, we retrospectively investigated 83 prostate cancer patients by fivefold cross-validation and a hold-out test. The prostate, bladder, rectum, and urethra were segmented and compared with manual contours using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), 95% Hausdorff distance (HD95 ), mean surface distance (MSD), center of mass distance (CMD), and volume difference (VD).  Results:   The proposed method visually outperforms two competing methods, showing better agreement with manual contours and fewer misidentified speckles. In the cross-validation study, the respective DSC and HD95 results were as follows for each organ: bladder 0.75 ± 0.12, 2.58 ± 0.7 mm; prostate 0.93 ± 0.03, 2.28 ± 0.64 mm; rectum 0.90 ± 0.07, 1.65 ± 0.52 mm; and urethra 0.86 ± 0.07, 1.85 ± 1.71 mm. For the hold-out tests, the DSC and HD95 results were as follows: bladder 0.76 ± 0.13, 2.93 ± 1.29 mm; prostate 0.94 ± 0.03, 2.27 ± 0.79 mm; rectum 0.92 ± 0.03, 1.90 ± 0.28 mm; and urethra 0.85 ± 0.06, 1.81 ± 0.72 mm. Segmentation was performed in under 5 seconds.  Conclusion:   The proposed method demonstrated fast and accurate multi-organ segmentation performance.

Methods:   Here, by targeting 4,096 human diseases, including 384 cancers, we propose a greedy computational model based on a heterogeneous multilayer network for the repurposing of 1,419 existing drugs in DrugBank. We performed additional experimental validation for the dominant repurposed drugs in cancer.  Results:   The overall performance of the model was well supported by cross-validation and literature mining. Focusing on the top-ranked repurposed drugs in cancers, we verified the anticancer effects of 5 repurposed drugs widely used clinically in drug sensitivity experiments. Because of the distinctive antitumor effects of nifedipine (an antihypertensive agent) and nortriptyline (an antidepressant drug) in prostate cancer, we further explored their underlying mechanisms by using quantitative proteomics. Our analysis revealed that both nifedipine and nortriptyline affected the cancer-related pathways of DNA replication, the cell cycle, and RNA transport. Moreover, in vivo experiments demonstrated that nifedipine and nortriptyline significantly inhibited the growth of prostate tumors in a xenograft model.

TEAD4 is retained in the nucleus by arginine, enhancing its recruitment to the promoter/enhancer regions of OXPHOS genes and mediating coordinated upregulation in a YAP1-independent but mTOR-dependent manner. Arginine also activates the expression of lysine acetyl-transferases and increases overall levels of acetylated histones and acetyl-CoA, facilitating TEAD4 recruitment.

Here we show that the prostate-specific homeoprotein NKX3.1 suppresses prostate cancer initiation by protecting mitochondria from oxidative stress. Integrating analyses of genetically engineered mouse models, human prostate cancer cells, and human prostate cancer organotypic cultures, we find that, in response to oxidative stress, NKX3.1 is imported to mitochondria via the chaperone protein HSPA9, where it regulates transcription of mitochondrial-encoded electron transport chain (ETC) genes, thereby restoring oxidative phosphorylation and preventing cancer initiation. Germline polymorphisms of NKX3.1 associated with increased cancer risk fail to protect from oxidative stress or suppress tumorigenicity. Low expression levels of NKX3.1 combined with low expression of mitochondrial ETC genes are associated with adverse clinical outcome, whereas high levels of mitochondrial NKX3.1 protein are associated with favorable outcome. This work reveals an extranuclear role for NKX3.1 in suppression of prostate cancer by protecting mitochondrial function. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings uncover a nonnuclear function for NKX3.1 that is a key mechanism for suppression of prostate cancer. Analyses of the expression levels and subcellular localization of NKX3.1 in patients at risk of cancer progression may improve risk assessment in a precision prevention paradigm, particularly for men undergoing active surveillance.See related commentary by Finch and Baena, p. 2132.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 2113.""","""['Alexandros Papachristodoulou#', 'Antonio Rodriguez-Calero', 'Sukanya Panja', 'Elizabeth Margolskee', 'Renu K Virk', 'Teresa A Milner', 'Luis Pina Martina', 'Jaime Y Kim', 'Matteo Di Bernardo', 'Alanna B Williams', 'Elvis A Maliza', 'Joseph M Caputo', 'Christopher Haas', 'Vinson Wang', 'Guarionex Joel De Castro', 'Sven Wenske', 'Hanina Hibshoosh', 'James M McKiernan', 'Michael M Shen', 'Mark A Rubin', 'Antonina Mitrofanova', 'Aditya Dutta#', 'Cory Abate-Shen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Discov""","""['Spatiofunctional Dynamics of NKX3.1 to Safeguard the Prostate from Cancer.', 'Spatiofunctional Dynamics of NKX3.1 to Safeguard the Prostate from Cancer.', 'Cooperation of loss of NKX3.1 and inflammation in prostate cancer initiation.', 'Loss-of-function of Nkx3.1 promotes increased oxidative damage in prostate carcinogenesis.', 'Mechanisms of prostate tumorigenesis: roles for transcription factors Nkx3.1 and Egr1.', 'Regulating NKX3.1 stability and function: Post-translational modifications and structural determinants.', 'Mitochondrial carrier 1 (MTCH1) governs ferroptosis by triggering the FoxO1-GPX4 axis-mediated retrograde signaling in cervical cancer cells.', 'Gene Expression and Drug Sensitivity Analysis of Mitochondrial Chaperones Reveals That HSPD1 and TRAP1 Expression Correlates with Sensitivity to Inhibitors of DNA Replication and Mitosis.', 'The Transcriptomic Profiles of ESR1 and MMP3 Stratify the Risk of Biochemical Recurrence in Primary Prostate Cancer beyond Clinical Features.', 'Transcription factor NKX2-1 drives serine and glycine synthesis addiction in cancer.', 'Extensive germline-somatic interplay contributes to prostate cancer progression through HNF1B co-option of TMPRSS2-ERG.']"""

However, the prognostic importance of genetic variants of hnRNP genes in clinical outcomes of prostate cancer remains to be elucidated.  Patients and methods:   We studied the association of 78 germline single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 23 hnRNP genes with the overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and progression-free survival (PFS) in 630 patients with prostate cancer receiving androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT).  Results:   PTBP1 rs10420407 was the most significant SNP (false discovery rate q=0.003) and carriers of the A allele exhibited poor OS, CSS, and PFS. Multivariate Cox analysis confirmed PTBP1 rs10420407 A allele was an independent negative prognostic factor for OS and PFS. Expression quantitative trait loci analysis showed that the rs10420407 A allele had a trend towards increased PTBP1 mRNA expression, and higher expression was correlated with prostate cancer aggressiveness and poor patient prognosis. Meta-analysis of 16 independent studies further indicated a tumorigenic effect of PTBP1, with a higher expression in prostate cancers than in adjacent normal tissues (p<0.001).  Conclusion:   Our data suggest that PTBP1 rs10420407 may influence patient response to ADT, and PTBP1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer progression.""","""['Shu-Pin Huang', 'Lih-Chyang Chen', 'Yei-Tsung Chen', 'Cheng-Hsueh Lee', 'Chao-Yuan Huang', 'Chia-Cheng Yu', 'Victor C Lin', 'Te-Ling Lu', 'Bo-Ying Bao']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Genomics Proteomics""","""['The Splicing Factor PTBP1 Promotes Expression of Oncogenic Splice Variants and Predicts Poor Prognosis in Patients with Non-muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer.', 'Significance of Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein 1 Expression in Colorectal Cancer.', 'High expression of PTBP1 promote invasion of colorectal cancer by alternative splicing of cortactin.', 'Functional interactions between polypyrimidine tract binding protein and PRI peptide ligand containing proteins.', 'Gene Polymorphism-related Individual and Interracial Differences in the Outcomes of Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Small ankyrin 1 (sANK1) promotes docetaxel resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells by enhancing oxidative phosphorylation.', 'Blocking lncRNA-SNHG16 sensitizes gastric cancer cells to 5-Fu through targeting the miR-506-3p-PTBP1-mediated glucose metabolism.', 'Long noncoding RNA DIO3OS induces glycolytic-dominant metabolic reprogramming to promote aromatase inhibitor resistance in breast cancer.']"""

Expression of one of the down-regulated miRNAs, miR-139-5p, was significantly associated with a lower incidence of biochemical recurrence and metastasis. Transcriptome profiling of miR-139-expressing prostate cancer cells revealed up-regulation of genes involved in interferon (IFN) stimulation. The association between miR-139 and IFN-β was further explored in this study.  Materials and methods:   We examined miR-139 transfected PC3, Du145 and LNCaP cells and the associated IFN response by transcriptome sequencing, immunoblotting and pulldown assays.  Results:   Treatment of prostate cancer cells by miR-139 resulted in the up-regulation of IFN-related genes. Specifically, miR-139 induced expression of the IFN-β protein. The ability of miR-139 to induce IFN-β was due to its binding to RIG-1 and the induction of IFN-related genes was found to be dependent on RIG-1 expression.

The resulting increase in MRI demand might place health care systems under substantial stress.  Objective:   To determine whether single-plane biparametric MRI (fast MRI) workup could represent an alternative to mpMRI in the detection of clinically significant (cs) PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   Between April 2018 and February 2020, 311 biopsy-naïve men aged ≤75 yr with PSA ≤15 ng/ml and negative digital rectal examination were randomly assigned to 1.5-T fast MRI (n = 213) or mpMRI (n = 98).  Intervention:   All MRI examinations were classified according to Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2. Men scored PI-RADS 1-2 underwent 12-core standard biopsy (SBx) and those with PI-RADS 4-5 on fast MRI or PI-RADS 3-5 on mpMRI underwent targeted biopsy in combination with SBx. Equivocal cases on fast MRI (PI-RADS 3) underwent mpMRI and then biopsy according to the findings.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary outcome was to compare the detection rate of csPCa in both study arms, setting a 10% difference for noninferiority. The secondary outcome was to assess the role of prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD) in ruling out men who could avoid biopsy among those with equivocal findings on fast MRI.  Results and limitations:   The overall MRI detection rate for csPCa was 23.5% (50/213; 95% confidence interval [CI] 18.0-29.8%) with fast MRI and 32.7% (32/98; 95% CI 23.6-42.9%) with mpMRI (difference 9.2%; p = 0.09). The reproducibility of the study could have been affected by its single-center nature.  Conclusions:   Fast MRI followed by mpMRI in equivocal cases is not inferior to mpMRI in the detection of csPCa among biopsy-naïve men aged ≤75 yr with PSA ≤15 ng/ml and negative digital rectal examination. These findings could pave the way to broader use of MRI for PCa diagnosis.  Patient summary:   A faster MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) protocol with no contrast agent and fewer scan sequences for examination of the prostate is not inferior to the typical MRI approach in the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer. If our findings are confirmed in other studies, fast MRI could represent a time-saving and less invasive examination for men with suspicion of prostate cancer.

Most SCNECP arise from conventional prostate adenocarcinoma (CPAC) treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).  Case presentations:   We identified four cases of CPAC treated with ADT, which evolved to SCNECP with liver metastasis. The average interval between the diagnosis of CPAC and SCNECP was 102 months (range: 12 to 168). Histologically, the tumors showed nests of cells with high nuclear:cytoplasmic ratios, granular chromatin, and frequent mitoses. All cases were synaptophysin, chromogranin, and AE1/AE3 positive, with a Ki-67 labeling index ≥70%. NKX3.1 was negative in all but one case and TTF-1 was positive in half. Weak ERG positivity by IHC was seen in one case which also demonstrated the TMPRSS2-ERG gene rearrangement; all other cases were negative for ERG by IHC. Serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels were normal to near-normal in all. The median interval between the diagnosis of SCNECP and death was 3.25 months (range: 0.75 to 26).  Conclusions:   Our case series highlights the importance of considering a prostate primary, even in the setting of normal PSA levels and loss of prostate markers, when diagnosing neuroendocrine carcinoma in the liver. Further, we emphasize the significance of diagnosing SCNECP that metastasizes to the liver, as it portends a particularly dismal prognosis.""","""['Phoenix D Bell', 'Aaron R Huber', 'Diana Agostini-Vulaj']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Diagn Pathol""","""['TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion in metastatic prostate cancers: a study of fine needle aspiration specimens.', 'Association of intraductal carcinoma of the prostate detected by initial histological specimen and neuroendocrine prostate cancer: A report of three cases.', 'Androgen deprivation modulates gene expression profile along prostate cancer progression.', 'Metastatic prostate cancer diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration: Contemporary cytopathologic and biomarker assessment with clinical correlates.', 'Large cell differentiation of metastatic prostate cancer after androgen deprivation therapy.']"""

Most existing models are based on transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-guided biopsy. On the other hand, transperineal template-guided prostate biopsy (TTPB) has been reported to be more accurate in evaluating prostate cancer. The objective of this study is to develop a prediction model of the detection of high-grade prostate cancer (HGPC) on initial TTPB.  Result:   A total of 1352 out of 3794 (35.6%) patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer, 848 of whom had tumour with Grade Group 2-5. Age, PSA, PV, DRE and f/t PSA are independent predictors of HGPC with p < 0.001. The model showed good discrimination ability (c-index 0.886) and calibration during internal validation and good clinical performance was observed through decision curve analysis. The external validation of CPCC-RC, an existing model, demonstrated that models based on TRUS-guided biopsy may underestimate the risk of HGPC in patients who underwent TTPB.  Conclusion:   We established a prediction model which showed good discrimination ability and calibration in predicting the detection of HGPC by initial TTPB. This model can be used to aid clinical decision making for Chinese patients and other Asian populations with similar genomic backgrounds, after external validations are conducted to further confirm its clinical applicability.""","""['Yuliang Chen', 'Zhien Zhou', 'Yi Zhou', 'Xingcheng Wu', 'Yu Xiao', 'Zhigang Ji', 'Hanzhong Li', 'Weigang Yan']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Development and external multicenter validation of Chinese Prostate Cancer Consortium prostate cancer risk calculator for initial prostate biopsy.', 'The Efficacy of Transrectal Ultrasound Guided Biopsy Versus Transperineal Template Biopsy of the Prostate in Diagnosing Prostate Cancer in Men with Previous Negative Transrectal Ultrasound Guided Biopsy.', 'Prospective validation of a nomogram predictive of a positive initial prostate biopsy.', 'Cancer Location in Upgrading and Detection after Transperineal Template-Guided Mapping Biopsy for Patients in Active Surveillance and Negative Transrectal Ultrasonography-Guided Prostate Biopsy.', 'Toward an MRI-based nomogram for the prediction of transperineal prostate biopsy outcome: A physician and patient decision tool.', 'Application of single-point prostate biopsy in elderly patients with highly suspected prostate cancer.', 'MRI-targeted biopsy cores from prostate index lesions: assessment and prediction of the number needed.']"""

We evaluated drivers of these disparities in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) national registry and an equal-access system, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).  Methods:   We identified African American and White patients diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2004 and 2015 in SEER (n = 311 691) and the VHA (n = 90 749). We analyzed the association between race and metastatic disease at presentation using multivariable logistic regression adjusting for sociodemographic factors and PCSM using sequential competing-risks regression adjusting for disease and sociodemographic factors.  Results:   The median follow-up was 5.3 years in SEER and 4.7 years in the VHA. African American men were more likely than White men to present with metastatic disease in SEER (adjusted odds ratio = 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.17 to 1.30) but not in the VHA (adjusted odds ratio = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.98 to 1.17). African American vs White race was associated with an increased risk of PCSM in SEER (subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR] = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.10 to 1.60) but not in the VHA (SHR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.93 to 1.08). Adjusting for disease extent, prostate-specific antigen, and Gleason score eliminated the association between race and PCSM in SEER (aSHR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.93 to 1.16).  Conclusions:   Racial disparities in PCSM were present in a nationally representative registry but not in an equal-access health-care system, because of differences in advanced disease at presentation.

Prostate-specific deletion of Pten and Smad4 in mice recapitulated the disease progression of human prostate adenocarcinoma, including metastasis to lymph nodes and lung. Moreover, Pten/Smad4 tumors fostered an immunosuppressive microenvironment dominated by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). However, the response of Pten/Smad4 tumors to androgen deprivation and anti-androgen therapies has not been described. Here, we report that the combination of surgical castration and enzalutamide treatment in Pten/Smad4 mice slowed down the tumor growth and prolonged the median survival of the mice for 8 weeks. Treatment-naïve and castration-resistant primary tumors exhibited comparable levels of immune infiltrations with the exception of reduced monocytic MDSCs in CRPC. RNA profiling of treatment-naïve and castration-resistant primary tumors revealed largely preserved transcriptome with modest expressional alterations of collagen-related and immune-related genes, among which CC chemokine receptor type 2 (Ccr2) downregulation and predicted negative activation in CRPC was consistent with reduced monocytic MDSC infiltration. Importantly, significant transcriptomic reprograming was observed in lung metastatic CRPC compared with primary CRPC and enriched for immune-related and coagulation-related pathways. At the individual gene level, we validated the expression changes of some of the most upregulated (Cd36, Bmp5, Bmp6, Etv5, Prex2, Ptprb, Egfl6, Itga8 and Cxcl12) and downregulated genes (Cxcl9 and Adamts5).

To better understand these PSMA responses and potential relationship to progressive PCa, the PET imaging agent, [18F]DCFPyL, was used to assess changes in PSMA expression in response to ADT using genomically characterized LuCaP patient-derived xenograft mouse models (LuCaP-PDXs) which were found to be sensitive to ADT (LuCaP73 and LuCaP136;CS) or resistant (LuCaP167;CR).

Control and ADT-treated LuCaPs were imaged before ADT (0 days) and 2-, 7-, 14-, and 21-days post-ADT from which tumor:muscle ratios (T:Ms) were determined and concurrently tumor volumes were measured (caliper). After the 21-day imaging, biodistributions and histologic/genomic (PSMA, AR) analysis were done.  Results:   [18F]DCFPyL exhibited high affinity for PSMA and distinguished different levels of PSMA in LuCaP tumors. Post-ADT CS LuCaP73 and LuCaP136 tumor volumes significantly decreased at day 7 or 14 respectively vs controls, whereas the CR LuCaP167 tumor volumes were minimally changed. [18F]DCFPyL imaging T:Ms were increased 3-5-fold in treated LuCaP73 tumors vs controls, while treated LuCaP136 T:Ms remained unchanged which was confirmed by day 21 biodistribution results. For treated LuCaP167, T:Ms were decreased (~ 45 %) vs controls but due to low T:M values (<2) may not be indicative of PSMA level changes. LuCaP73 tumor PSMA histologic/genomic results were comparable to imaging/biodistribution results, whereas the results for other tumor types varied.  Conclusion:   Tumor responses to ADT varied from sensitive to resistant among these LuCaP PDXs, while only the high PSMA expressing LuCaP model exhibited an increase in PSMA levels in response to ADT. These models may be useful in understanding the clinical relevance of PSMA PET responses to ADT and potentially the relationship to disease progression as it may relate to the genomic signature.""","""['Jyoti Roy', 'Margaret E White', 'Falguni Basuli', 'Ana Christina L Opina', 'Karen Wong', 'Morgan Riba', 'Anita T Ton', 'Xiang Zhang', 'Keith H Jansson', 'Elijah Edmondson', 'Donna Butcher', 'Frank I Lin', 'Peter L Choyke', 'Kathleen Kelly', 'Elaine M Jagoda']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Mol Imaging Biol""","""['2-(3-{1-Carboxy-5-(6-18Ffluoro-pyridine-3-carbonyl)-amino-pentyl}-ureido)-pentanedioic acid, 18FDCFPyL, a PSMA-based PET imaging agent for prostate cancer.', 'Simplified Methods for Quantification of 18F-DCFPyL Uptake in Patients with Prostate Cancer.', 'Prospective Comparison of PET Imaging with PSMA-Targeted 18F-DCFPyL Versus Na18F for Bone Lesion Detection in Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) with F-18-Labeled Compounds: the Influence of Prosthetic Groups on Tumor Uptake and Clearance Profile.', '2-(3-{1-Carboxy-5-(6-18Ffluoro-pyridine-3-carbonyl)-amino-pentyl}-ureido)-pentanedioic acid.', 'Bipolar Androgen Therapy Followed by Androgen Receptor Inhibition as Sequential Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Reversible epigenetic alterations mediate PSMA expression heterogeneity in advanced metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Flare on 18FPSMA-1007 PET/CT after short-term androgen deprivation therapy and its correlation to FDG uptake: possible marker of tumor aggressiveness in treatment-naïve metastatic prostate cancer patients.', 'Molecular Imaging Assessment of Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Prostate Cancer.', 'Fluorine-18 Labeled Urea-Based Ligands Targeting Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) with Increased Tumor and Decreased Renal Uptake.']"""

With only a 31% 5-year survival rate for patients with an initial diagnosis of stage-four prostate cancer, the necessity for early screening and diagnosis is clear. In this paper, we present navigation accuracy results for Promaxo's MR system intended to be used in a physician's office for image-guided transperineal prostate biopsy.  Methods:   The office-based low-field MR system was used to acquire images of prostate phantoms with needles inserted through a transperineal template. Coordinates of the estimated sample core locations in the office-based MR system were compared to ground truth needle coordinates identified in a 1.5T external reference scan. The error was measured as the distance between the planned target and the ground truth core center and as the shortest perpendicular distance between the planned target and the ground truth trajectory of the whole core.  Results:   The average error between the planned target and the ground truth core center was 2.57 ± 1.02 mm, [1.93-3.21] 95% CI. The average error between the planned target to the actual core segment was 2.05 ± 1.24 mm, [1.53-2.56] 95% CI.  Conclusion:   The average navigation errors were below the clinically significant threshold of 5 mm.

The objective of this study was to describe racial and ethnic differences in self-reported health status, chronic conditions, and selected behavioral risk factors among prostate cancer survivors in the US.  Methods:   We used data from the 2015 National Health Interview Survey to calculate the prevalence of various levels of health status, chronic conditions, behavioral risk factors, and sociodemographic characteristics among prostate cancer survivors aged 50 years or older. We stratified results by race and ethnicity.  Results:   Of the 317 prostate cancer survivors in our sample, 33.1% reported no physical activity, 64.2% reported being current drinkers, 26.1% characterized their drinking as moderate/heavy, 42.3% reported being former smokers, and 8.7% were current smokers. Nearly one-third (29.1%) of survivors were obese (body mass index ≥30), and 15.1% had 3 to 6 chronic conditions. A greater percentage of White (29.7%) than Black (14.2%) or Hispanic (16.3%) survivors were moderate/heavy drinkers. A greater percentage of Black (16.2%) than White (7.5%) or Hispanic (7.3%) survivors were current smokers. A greater percentage of Black (25.1%) or Hispanic (27.7%) than White (11.4%) survivors had 3 to 6 chronic conditions.  Conclusion:   As the population of older men increases, prostate cancer diagnoses and those surviving the disease will also increase. Significant racial and ethnic group differences in behavioral risk factors and chronic conditions exist among prostate cancer survivors.

Materials and methods:   We identified 274 men receiving FT for PCa using either high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) or cryotherapy at a high volume center between 2009 and 2018. Survival analyses using Kaplan-Meier method were used to assess any additional treatment and radical treatment rates according to PCa location. Propensity-score match analysis was used to compare oncologic outcomes of HIFU vs cryotherapy according to PCa location. Covariates were prostate specific antigen, clinical stage, prostate volume, Gleason score, maximum cancer core length, percentage of positive cores and treatment modality.  Results:   A total of 166 and 108 men received FT with HIFU and cryotherapy, respectively. Overall, 39% (106) and 31% (85) received at least an additional treatment and a radical treatment after FT, respectively, with a median followup of 51 months. At 36 months' followup, the rates of any additional treatment-free survival were 71%, 75%, and 69% for patients with basal, mid-prostate and apical disease, respectively (p=0.7). At multivariable logistic regression analysis, PCa location was not significantly associated with higher risk of either any additional treatment or radical treatment (all p >0.4). After matching, there was no difference between HIFU vs cryotherapy in terms of any additional treatment rates according to PCa location.  Conclusions:   The PCa location does not significantly affect the rate of failure after FT. The presence of an apical lesion should not be considered an exclusion criteria for FT. Both HIFU and cryotherapy likely achieve similar medium-term oncologic results regardless of PCa location.""","""['Armando Stabile', 'Rafael Sanchez-Salas', 'Rafael Tourinho-Barbosa', 'Petr Macek', 'Francesco Pellegrino', 'Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Marco Moschini', 'Nathalie Cathala', 'Annick Mombet', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Xavier Cathelineau']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Role of Systematic Control Biopsies following Partial Gland Ablation with High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound for Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', 'Focal High-intensity Focused Ultrasound Targeted Hemiablation for Unilateral Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Evaluation of Oncologic and Functional Outcomes.', 'Comparing High-Intensity Focal Ultrasound Hemiablation to Robotic Radical Prostatectomy in the Management of Unilateral Prostate Cancer: A Matched-Pair Analysis.', 'Focal Treatment for Unilateral Prostate Cancer Using High-Intensity Focal Ultrasound: A Comprehensive Study of Pooled Data.', 'Surveillance after prostate focal therapy.', 'Robot Partial Prostatectomy for Anterior Cancer: Long-term Functional and Oncological Outcomes at 7 Years.', 'Oncological results and cancer control definition in focal therapy\xa0for Prostate Cancer: a systematic review.', 'Patient-reported Satisfaction and Regret Following Focal Therapy for Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Multicenter Evaluation.', 'Focal therapy for prostate cancer: what is really needed to move from investigational to valid therapeutic alternative?-a narrative review.', 'Focal prostate cancer therapy in the era of multiparametric MRI: a review of options and outcomes.']"""

Here, the impact of hydrogel-based 3D engineered microtissues on EVs secreted by benign and malignant prostate cells is assessed. Compared to 2D cultures, yield of EVs per cell is significantly increased for cancer cells cultured in 3D. Whole transcriptome sequencing and proteomics of 2D-EV and 3D-EV samples reveal stark contrasts in molecular cargo. For one cell type in particular, LNCaP, enrichment is observed exclusively in 3D-EVs of GDF15, FASN, and TOP1, known drivers of prostate cancer progression. Using imaging flow cytometry in a novel approach to validate a putative EV biomarker, colocalization in single EVs of GDF15 with CD9, a universal EV marker, is demonstrated. Finally, in functional assays it is observed that only 3D-EVs, unlike 2D-EVs, confer increased invasiveness and chemoresistance to cells in 2D. Collectively, this study highlights the value of engineered 3D microtissue cultures for the study of bona fide EV cargoes and their potential to identify biomarkers that are not detectable in EVs secreted by cells cultured in standard 2D conditions.""","""['Christopher Millan', 'Lukas Prause', 'Queralt Vallmajo-Martin', 'Natalie Hensky', 'Daniel Eberli']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Adv Healthc Mater""","""['3D cell culture stimulates the secretion of in vivo like extracellular vesicles.', 'Nanoscale flow cytometry to distinguish subpopulations of prostate extracellular vesicles in patient plasma.', 'Distinct prostate cancer-related mRNA cargo in extracellular vesicle subsets from prostate cell lines.', 'Extracellular vesicles and their nucleic acids for biomarker discovery.', 'Visualizing Extracellular Vesicles and Their Function in 3D Tumor Microenvironment Models.', 'NGS Data Repurposing Allows Detection of tRNA Fragments as Gastric Cancer Biomarkers in Patient-Derived Extracellular Vesicles.', 'Significant increase of serum extracellular vesicle-packaged growth differentiation factor 15 in type 2 diabetes mellitus: a cross-sectional study.', 'A quick pipeline for the isolation of 3D cell culture-derived extracellular vesicles.', 'Hydrogels for Exosome Delivery in Biomedical Applications.', 'Advances in the analysis of single extracellular vesicles: A critical review.']"""

Methods:   Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank test were performed on all LuPSMA therapy patients with at least 12 months of follow-up data available (n = 68). Comparison across patients was made based on several variables including the baseline characteristics of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax ) and metastasis site and by biochemical response.  Results:   The 18-month overall survival estimate for the patient cohort was 63.8%. Patients with baseline serum PSA <20 µg/L had a greater 18-month survival estimate (79.9%) compared to PSA ≥20 µg/L (53.8%; P < 0.05). Patients with an SUVmax >15 had an 18-month survival estimate of 56.0%, compared to 38.0% in patients with SUVmax ≤15 (P < 0.05). No significant difference in overall survival was observed by metastasis site. Both a decrease in PSA after two LuPSMA therapy cycles and the maximum response over the treatment course being a decline in PSA were indicative of greater overall survival (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001 respectively).

Method:   In a cross-sectional study in 3 workshops for people with intellectual disabilities, the use of health care was surveyed by means of questionnaires from their relatives. The evaluation was carried out descriptively and by means of inferential statistics comparing participants with the general population as well as within the group of participants for socio-demographic differences.  Results:   Almost all 181 participants (participation rate 19.3%) had a family doctor.

They made less frequent use of screening for colon, breast, cervix and prostate and more frequent use for skin cancer and general check-up. Dental check-ups and preventive measures showed no difference. Participants living in institutional settings made more use of the regular services than those living with relatives or alone. Participants with a migration background were less aware of care services.  Conclusions:   The results do not show any indications of a general undersupply of health care.

To combat this disease, it is needed to identify important tumor suppressor genes and elucidate the molecular mechanisms. S100 calcium-binding protein A14 (S100A14), a member of the S100 family, is located on chromosome 1q21.3 and contains an EF-hand motif that binds calcium. S100A14 is involved in a variety of tumor biological processes in several types of cancers. Its expression level and related biological functions are tissue or tumor specific. However, its possible effects on prostate cancer are still unclear. Herein, we found the low expression of S100A14 in human prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. S100A14 suppressed the proliferation of prostate cancer cells and promoted cell apoptosis. Additionally, S100A14 suppressed the motility and EMT processes of prostate cancer cells. We further found S100A14 promoted the expression of FAT1 and activated the Hippo pathway, which, therefore, suppressed the prostate cancer progression. The in vivo assays confirmed that S100A14 suppressed tumor growth of prostate cancer cells through FAT1-mediated Hippo pathway in mice.

With bpMRI, more men can undergo MRI at a lower cost and they can be spared the invasiveness of intravenous access. The aim of this study was to assess cancer detection in bpMRI vs mpMRI in sequential screening for prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   Within the ongoing Göteborg PCa screening 2 trial, we assessed cancer detection in 551 consecutive participants undergoing prostate MRI. In the same session, readers first assessed bpMRI and then mpMRI. Four targeted biopsies were performed for lesions scored PIRADS 3-5 with bpMRI and/or mpMRI.  Results:   Cancer was detected in 84/551 cases (15.2%; 95% CI: 12.4-18.4) with mpMRI and in 83/551 cases (15.1%; 95% CI: 12.3-18.2%) with bpMRI. The relative risk (RR) for cancer detection with bpMRI compared to mpMRI was 0.99 (95% one-sided CI: > 94.8); bpMRI was non-inferior to mpMRI (10% non-inferiority margin). bpMRI resulted in fewer false positives, 45/128 (35.2%), compared to mpMRI, 52/136 (38.2%), RR = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.84-0.98. Of 8 lesions scored positive only with mpMRI, 7 were false positives. The PPV for MRI and targeted biopsy was 83/128 (64.8%) for bpMRI and 84/136 (61.8%) for mpMRI, RR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01-1.10.  Conclusions:   In a PSA-screened population, bpMRI was non-inferior to mpMRI for cancer detection and resulted in fewer false positives.  Key points:   • In screening for prostate cancer with PSA followed by MRI, biparametric MRI allows radiologists to detect an almost similar number of prostate cancers and score fewer false positive lesions compared to multiparametric MRI. • In a screening program, high sensitivity should be weighed against cost and risks for healthy men; a large number of men can be saved the exposure of gadolinium contrast medium by adopting biparametric MRI and at the same time allowing for a higher turnover in the MRI room.""","""['Jonas Wallström', 'Kjell Geterud', 'Kimia Kohestani', 'Stephan E Maier', 'Marianne Månsson', 'Carl-Gustaf Pihl', 'Andreas Socratous', 'Rebecka Arnsrud Godtman', 'Mikael Hellström', 'Jonas Hugosson']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Diagnostic accuracy of biparametric versus multiparametric prostate MRI: assessment of contrast benefit in clinical practice.', 'MRI combined with PSA density in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer in patients with PSA serum levels of 4∼10ng/mL: Biparametric versus multiparametric MRI.', 'Head-to-head comparison of biparametric versus multiparametric MRI of the prostate before robot-assisted transperineal fusion prostate biopsy.', 'The future direction of imaging in prostate cancer: MRI with or without contrast injection.', 'Clinical impact of abbreviated unenhanced prostate protocols in magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Could Biparametric MRI Replace Multiparametric MRI in the Management of Prostate Cancer?', 'Improving the understanding of PI-RADS in practice: characters of PI-RADS 4 and 5 lesions with negative biopsy.', 'Biparametric MRI-based radiomics classifiers for the detection of prostate cancer in patients with PSA serum levels of 4∼10 ng/mL.', 'Prostate Cancer Screening with PSA and MRI Followed by Targeted Biopsy Only.', 'Cost-effectiveness of Prostate Cancer Screening Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging or Standard Biopsy Based on the STHLM3-MRI Study.']"""

Experimental evidence from a vignette survey""","""Background:   Patient-centredness is an essential quality parameter of modern healthcare. Accordingly, involving patients in decisions about care is required by international laws and an increasing number of medical codes and standards. These directives are based on ethical principles of autonomy. Still, there is limited empirical knowledge about the influence of patient involvement on satisfaction with care.  Objective:   In a large national vignette survey, we aimed to empirically test healthcare users' satisfaction with healthcare given different degrees of patient involvement, choices made and outcomes.  Methods:   A web-based cross-sectional survey distributed to a randomised sample of men in Denmark aged 45-70 years. Case vignettes used prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening for early detection of prostate cancer as a clinical model. Using a 5-point Likert scale, we measured respondents' satisfaction with care in scenarios which differed in the amount of patient involvement (ranging from no involvement, through involvement with neutral or nudged information, to shared decision-making), the decision made (PSA test or no PSA test) and clinical outcomes (no cancer detected, detection of treatable cancer and detection of non-treatable cancer).  Results:   Participating healthcare users tended to be more satisfied with healthcare in scenarios illustrating greater levels of patient involvement. Participants were positive towards nudging in favour of the intervention but patient involvement through shared decision-making obtained the highest satisfaction ratings (Likert rating 3.81 without any involvement vs 4.07 for shared decision-making, p<0.001). Greater involvement also had an ameliorating effect on satisfaction if a non-treatable cancer was later diagnosed.  Conclusion:   Our study provides empirical support for the hypothesis that greater patient involvement in healthcare decision-making improves satisfaction with care irrespective of decisions made and clinical outcomes. Overall satisfaction with the care illustrated was highest when decisions were reached through shared decision-making.""","""['Søren Birkeland', 'Marie Bismark', 'Michael John Barry', 'Sören Möller']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMJ Qual Saf""","""[""Addressing disparities in patients' opportunities for and competencies in shared decision making."", 'Does greater patient involvement in healthcare decision-making affect malpractice complaints?

Materials and methods:   We identified 398 consecutive men who underwent both transperineal systematic and targeted biopsy between January 2015 to January 2019. We reclassified overlapping systematic cores in the MRI regions of interest as target cores. The detection rates of SBx and TBx were compared using McNemar's test.  Results:   Detection rate of csCaP (grade group ≥2) was 42% (168/398). Median number of systematic and targeted cores were 23 (IQR 19-29) and 9 (IQR 6-12) respectively. A median of 3 (IQR 2-4) overlapping systematic cores were reclassified as targeted cores. After accounting for overlap, csPC detection rate on SBx decreased from 37% and 21% while the csCaP detection rate of TBx increased from 34% to 39% (both P < 0.001), with TBx having a better detection rate (39% vs. 21%, P < 0.001). A previous negative biopsy was associated with a lower risk of having csCaP on non-targeted SBx (OR 0.27, 95% CI: 0.12 - 0.58, P = 0.001). Only 5% (13/243) of those who had no cancer detected on TBx had csCaP on non-targeted SBx compared to 45% (70/155) of those who had csCaP on TBx (P< 0.001).

Methods:   Among patients admitted with STEMI in the United States National Readmission Database (NRD) from October 2015-December 2017, we identified patients with the diagnosis of active breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer. The primary endpoint was the 30-day unplanned readmission rate. Secondary endpoints included in-hospital outcomes during the index admission and causes of readmissions. A propensity score model was used to compare the outcomes of patients with and without cancer.  Results:   A total of 385,522 patients were included in the analysis: 5956 with cancer and 379,566 without cancer. After propensity score matching, 23,880 patients were compared (Cancer = 5949, No Cancer = 17,931). Patients with cancer had higher 30-day readmission rates (19% vs. 14%, p < 0.01). The most common causes for readmission among patients with cancer were cardiac (31%), infectious (21%), oncologic (17%), respiratory (4%), stroke (4%), and renal (3%).

The impact of germline DNA damage repair (gDDR) gene alterations on response to intense neoadjuvant ADT is not known.  Objective:   To evaluate the prevalence of gDDR alterations among men with localized PCa at high risk of recurrence and evaluate their impact on response to intense neoadjuvant ADT.  Design, setting, and participants:   We performed germline panel sequencing for 201 men with intermediate- and high-risk localized PCa from five randomized multicenter clinical trials of intense neoadjuvant ADT before RP.  Intervention:   Intense neoadjuvant ADT followed by RP.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The prevalence of pathogenic gDDR alterations and their association with exceptional pathologic response (complete response or minimal residual disease, defined as residual tumor with the largest cross-section dimension ≤5 mm) to intense neoadjuvant ADT and rates of post-RP biochemical recurrence.  Results and limitations:   Pathogenic gDDR alterations were detected in 19 (9.5%) of the 201 PCa patients. The most frequently altered genes were BRCA2 (n = 6; 3.0%) and ATM (n = 4; 2.0%). Patients with gDDR alterations exhibited similar rates of exceptional pathologic response (26% vs 22%), pT3 disease (42% vs 53%), lymph node involvement (5.3% vs 10%), extraprostatic extension (35% vs 54%), and positive margins (5.3% vs 13%) to patients without gDDR alterations (all p > 0.05). The 3-yr biochemical recurrence-free survival was also similar at 45% (95% confidence interval 7.9-78%) for men with gDDR alterations and 55% (95% confidence interval 44-64%) for men without gDDR alterations.  Conclusions:   gDDR alterations are common among men with intermediate- and high-risk localized PCa. Men with gDDR alterations appear to have a comparable response to intense neoadjuvant ADT to that among men without gDDR alterations and should not be excluded from consideration for this treatment approach.  Patient summary:   Intense therapy to inhibit the production of androgen hormones (eg, testosterone) before surgery may minimize the risk of cancer recurrence for men with high-risk localized prostate cancer. Inherited mutations in certain DNA repair genes are associated with particularly high rates of recurrence. We found that men with these mutations respond equally well to this intense androgen inhibition before surgery as men without the mutations.""","""['Jacob E Berchuck', 'Zhenwei Zhang', 'Rebecca Silver', 'Lucia Kwak', 'Wanling Xie', 'Gwo-Shu Mary Lee', 'Matthew L Freedman', 'Adam S Kibel', 'Eliezer M Van Allen', 'Rana R McKay', 'Mary-Ellen Taplin']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Molecular Subtyping in the Neoadjuvant Setting in Prostate Cancer: Envisioning the Possibilities.', 'Post prostatectomy outcomes of patients with high-risk prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant androgen blockade.', 'Intense androgen-deprivation therapy with abiraterone acetate plus leuprolide acetate in patients with localized high-risk prostate cancer: results of a randomized phase II neoadjuvant study.', 'The Role of Prostate-specific Antigen Persistence After Radical Prostatectomy for the Prediction of Clinical Progression and Cancer-specific Mortality in Node-positive Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed 2837 RARP patients (2010-2019) who fulfilled at least one AS entry criteria set: Prostate Cancer Research International - Active Surveillance (PRIAS), University of California San Francisco (UCSF) (San Francisco, CA, USA), National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) or University of Toronto, ON, Canada. We utilized four different iPCa definitions: 1) based on pT2 and Gleason Score ≤6 and also cumulative tumor-volume; 2) ≤2.5mL; 3) ≤0.7mL; or 4) ≤0.5mL. For each AS set we tested the rates of iPCa and compared between age <70 vs. ≥70 years. This was complemented by multivariable logistic regression (LRM) predicting iPCa, adjusted for age and clinical AS variables. Finally, within the subgroup who had iPCa, we tested the rate of those who were deemed preoperatively AS ineligible.  Results:   Between most (PRIAS) and least stringent (TORONTO) AS sets, iPCa was correctly predicted in 70-57%. Similarly, for iPCa definitions 2-4, rates were 59-42%, 34-19% and 27-14%. Senior patients harbored decreased proportions of iPCa. LRM confirmed that advanced age is associated with a lower chance of iPCa. More stringent AS sets lead to higher rates of AS ineligibility, e.g. 53% for PRIAS, despite iPCa.  Conclusions:   AS sets show limited accuracy for stricter iPCa definitions, which further declined with advanced age. Greater AS stringency resulted in more AS ineligible patients despite harboring iPCa. In consequence, patients are at risk for overtreatment.

Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted between high and low NRPL2 expression prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) cases in TCGA. CCK-8 assay, Western blot analysis of apoptotic proteins, and flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis were applied to test niraparib sensitivity. Immunofluorescent (IF) staining and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) were conducted to explore the proteins interacting with NPRL2. Results showed that the upregulation of a canonical protein-coding transcript of NPRL2 (ENST00000232501.7) is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Bioinformatic analysis predicts a physical interaction between NPRL2 and UBE2M, which is validated by a following Co-IP assay. This interaction increases NPRL2 stability by reducing polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Depletion of NPRL2 or UBE2M significantly increases the niraparib sensitivity of CRPC cells and enhances niraparib-induced tumor growth inhibition in vivo. NPRL2 cooperatively enhances UBE2M-mediated neddylation and facilitates the degradation of multiple substrates of Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs).

In addition, we analyzed the total binding obtained by adding residue binding energy contributions and compared the results with experimental values. The obtained residue-specific binding information should be very helpful in understanding the mechanism of drug resistance with respect to specific mutations and in the design of new generation drugs against possible new mutations.""","""['Guangfeng Shao', 'Jingxiao Bao', 'Xiaolin Pan', 'Xiao He', 'Yifei Qi', 'John Z H Zhang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Chem Biol Drug Des""","""['Molecular mechanism of R-bicalutamide switching from androgen receptor antagonist to agonist induced by amino acid mutations using molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculation.', 'Conformational dynamics of androgen receptors bound to agonists and antagonists.', 'A clinically relevant androgen receptor mutation confers resistance to second-generation antiandrogens enzalutamide and ARN-509.', 'Androgen Receptor Targeted Treatments of Prostate Cancer: 35 Years of Progress with Antiandrogens.', 'Non-Steroidal Androgen Receptor Antagonists and Prostate Cancer: A Survey on Chemical Structures Binding this Fast-Mutating Target.']"""

In this study, a deep learning approach was developed to automatize this registration procedure for HDR brachytherapy practice.  Methods:   Because of the lack of training labels and difficulty of accurate registration from inferior image quality, a new segmentation-based registration framework was proposed for this multi-modality image registration problem. The framework consisted of two segmentation networks and a deformable registration network, based on the weakly -supervised registration strategy. Specifically, two 3D V-Nets were trained for the prostate segmentation on the MR and US images separately, to generate the weak supervision labels for the registration network training. Besides the image pair, the corresponding prostate probability maps from the segmentation were further fed to the registration network to predict the deformation matrix, and an augmentation method was designed to randomly scale the input and label probability maps during the registration network training. The overlap between the deformed and fixed prostate contours was analyzed to evaluate the registration accuracy. Three datasets were collected from our institution for the MR and US image segmentation networks, and the registration network learning, which contained 121, 104, and 63 patient cases, respectively.  Results:   The mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) results of the two prostate segmentation networks are 0.86 ± 0.05 and 0.90 ± 0.03, for MR images and the US images after the needle insertion, respectively. The mean DSC, center-of-mass (COM) distance, Hausdorff distance (HD), and averaged symmetric surface distance (ASSD) results for the registration of manual prostate contours were 0.87 ± 0.05, 1.70 ± 0.89 mm, 7.21 ± 2.07 mm, 1.61 ± 0.64 mm, respectively. By providing the prostate probability map from the segmentation to the registration network, as well as applying the random map augmentation method, the evaluation results of the four metrics were all improved, such as an increase in DSC from 0.83 ± 0.08 to 0.86 ± 0.06 and from 0.86 ± 0.06 to 0.87 ± 0.05, respectively.  Conclusions:   A novel segmentation-based registration framework was proposed to automatically register prostate MR images to the treatment planning US images with metal artifacts, which not only largely saved the labor work on the data preparation, but also improved the registration accuracy. The evaluation results showed the potential of this approach in HDR prostate brachytherapy practice.""","""['Yizheng Chen', 'Lei Xing', 'Lequan Yu', 'Wu Liu', 'Benjamin Pooya Fahimian', 'Thomas Niedermayr', 'Hilary P Bagshaw', 'Mark Buyyounouski', 'Bin Han']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Label-driven magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) registration using weakly supervised learning for MRI-guided prostate radiotherapy.', 'Automatic prostate segmentation using deep learning on clinically diverse 3D transrectal ultrasound images.', 'Prostate CT segmentation method based on nonrigid registration in ultrasound-guided CT-based HDR prostate brachytherapy.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Use of three-dimensional radiation therapy planning tools and intraoperative ultrasound to evaluate high dose rate prostate brachytherapy implants.', 'FPGA Implementation of Image Registration Using Accelerated CNN.', 'A segmentation-informed deep learning framework to register dynamic two-dimensional magnetic resonance images of the vocal tract during speech.', 'Machine Learning in Prostate MRI for Prostate Cancer: Current Status and Future Opportunities.']"""

However, the mechanism underlying its clinical efficacy has not yet been reported.  Methods:   We conducted a randomized comparative study on about 100 patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer. Through nontarget metabolomics and tissue microarray immunohistochemistry, we investigated the difference in the endogenous metabolism of tumors in patients with prostate cancer who received or did not receive the neoadjuvant therapy.  Results:   Many endogenous metabolic pathways, especially nucleotide synthesis, glutathione metabolism, citric acid cycle, and lipid synthesis, in prostate cancer tissue were altered after the neoadjuvant treatment, and the levels of nearly 90% of the differentially regulated metabolites were significantly decreased. Moreover, the levels of key enzymes in the cellular energy pathways were downregulated in tumor tissues and upregulated in adjacent tissues after the treatment. The positive and negative effects of the neoadjuvant therapy on normal and tumor cells in the prostate, respectively, resulted in the activation of the former and inhibition of the latter, which helped in reducing the number of tumors and weakened their aggressiveness.

It will, therefore, be of great benefit to discover novel therapeutic target for the resistance. We aimed to identify candidate therapeutic targets for CBZ-resistance by proteomic analysis of extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from serum of DOC-resistant PC patients who later developed CBZ-resistance as well as those harvested from culture medium of DOC- and CBZ-resistant PC cell lines.  Methods:   Using T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain-containing protein 4 (Tim4) conjugated to magnetic beads, EVs were purified from serum of PC patients with DOC-resistance that was collected before and after acquiring CBZ-resistance and conditioned medium of DOC-resistant (22Rv1DR) and CBZ-resistant (22Rv1CR) PC cell lines. Protein analysis of EVs was performed by nanoLC-MS/MS, followed by a comparative analysis of protein expression and network analysis. The cytotoxic effect of a phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, ZSTK474, was evaluated by WST-1 assay. The expression and phosphorylation of PI3K and PTEN were examined by western blot analysis.  Results:   Among differentially regulated proteins, 77 and 61 proteins were significantly increased in EVs from CBZ-resistant PC cell line and patients, respectively. A comparison between the two datasets revealed that six proteins, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, cytosolic nonspecific dipeptidase, CD63, CD151, myosin light chain 9, and peroxiredoxin-6 were elevated in EVs from both cell line and patients. Network analysis of the increased EV proteins identified pathways associated with CBZ-resistance including PI3K signaling pathway. ZSTK474 significantly inhibited growth of 22Rv1CR cells and improved their sensitivity to CBZ. In 22Rv1CR cells, PI3K was activated and PTEN that inhibits PI3K was deactivated.  Conclusions:   Proteomic analysis of serum EVs was successfully accomplished by using Tim-4 as a tool to isolate highly purified EVs.

The objective of this study was to analyze the association between ADT and CVM across patient comorbidity status using prospectively collected data from a large clinical trial.  Methods:   In total, 1463 men were identified who were diagnosed with clinically localized, intermediate-risk/high-risk prostate cancer (T2b-T4, Gleason 7-10, or prostate-specific antigen >10 ng/mL) from 1993 to 2001 and managed with either radiation therapy (RT) alone or RT plus ADT during the randomized Prostate, Lung, Colon, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for cause-specific mortality (prostate cancer-specific mortality vs other-cause mortality-including the primary end point of CVM [death from ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular accident, or other circulatory disease]) were determined using Fine and Gray competing-risk regression analysis and stratified by comorbidity history.  Results:   There was no difference in the risk of 5-year CVM between ADT plus RT and RT alone (2.3% vs 3.3%, respectively; aHR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.38-1.24; P = .21) overall or on subgroup analysis among men with a history of ≥1 preexisting comorbidities (3.2% vs 5.3%, respectively; aHR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.43-1.60; P = .58), ≥2 preexisting comorbidities (6.9% vs 8.3%, respectively; aHR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.40-2.25; P = .90), or cardiovascular disease/risk factors (3.6% vs 4.3%, respectively; aHR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.44-1.65; P = .63). These results were all similar when each component of CVM was analyzed separately-either cardiac, stroke, or other vascular mortality (P > .05).

Regression analysis was used to identify demographic, clinical and surgical factors associated with the likelihood of BGM presence on surgical pathology. Oncologic outcomes included detectable PSA (>0.03 ng/ml), BCR (≥0.2 ng/ml) and progression to BCR or salvage treatment after detectable PSA. Life tables and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to determine the association of BGM and risk of oncologic outcomes.

Younger age, bilateral nerve sparing surgery and robotic approach were associated with presence of BGM while malignancy at the surgical margin (MSM) was not. At 7 years after RP, 29% experienced detectable PSA and 11% had BCR. In the subgroup of men who reached detectable PSA, 79% had progression within 7 years. On multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression, BGM status was not independently associated with detectable PSA, BCR and/or progression from detectable PSA to BCR or salvage treatment.

Results:   Latent profile analysis showed three patient classes: (1) normal levels of all symptoms (32%); (2) normal levels of all symptoms except for mild sleep problems and moderate fatigue (19%); and (3) normal pain, mild levels of sleep problems, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, and moderate fatigue (48%). Controlling for demographic covariates, lower psychological inflexibility, cognitive fusion, and values obstruction were associated with a higher likelihood of being in classes 1 or 2 than class 3.

Of these four factors, only greater mindfulness and activity engagement were associated with a higher likelihood of being in class 2 than class 3.  Conclusions:   Advanced cancer patients show heterogeneous symptom profiles, and even mild to moderate symptom levels are related to greater withdrawal from personally meaningful activities and less acceptance of cancer and internal experiences (e.g., symptoms, thoughts, feelings).

Current prevalence estimates in Nigeria are based on cancer registry data obtained primarily from hospital admissions and therefore not truly reflective of prostate cancer incidence. Prior autopsy series did not adhere to modern pathologic quality practices. The aim of this study was to explore the prevalence of asymptomatic prostate cancer among Nigerian men at the time of autopsy.  Methods:   Prostates were collected at autopsy at the Universities of Lagos and Calabar Teaching Hospitals from men aged more than 40 who died from causes other than prostate cancer. Thirty-nine prostates from Nigerian men autopsied in 2017 to 2018 were formalin-fixed, weighed, and sliced at 4 mm intervals. Haematoxylin and eosin-stained paraffin sections were prepared from these slices. Presence and Gleason grade of prostatic adenocarcinomas and presence of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) were recorded.  Results:   Mean age of cases was 55 ± 11 years and mean prostatic weight was 23.0 ± 10.9 g. The crude prevalence of HGPIN was 20.6%. Overall crude prevalence of prostate cancer was 8.8% (n = 34), increasing from 8.3% for men aged 40-59 (n = 23) to 10.0% for men ≥60 years old (n = 10). Two tumors were small and had Gleason Grade 3 + 3 or 3 + 4, and one large stage T3 tumor with Gleason Grade 4 + 3 disease and neuroendocrine appearance was found in a 54-year-old man.  Conclusions:   The 8.8% prevalence of subclinical prostate cancer at autopsy was similar to previously reported Nigerian studies with more limited tissue sampling (6.7%-10%), but considerably lower than estimates in other populations, including African Americans.

We evaluated prognostic factors for prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS) and progression-free survival (PFS) to characterize patients receiving treatment with ARTA who may benefit from MDT for oligoprogressive lesions. The impact of MDT on delaying NEST and the predictive factors for NEST-free survival (NEST-FS) were also assessed.  Materials and methods:   The clinical data of 54 metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with 126 oligoprogressive lesions receiving abiraterone (1 g/day) or enzalutamide (160 mg/day) before or after systemic chemotherapy were analyzed. A median of three lesions (range: 1-5) were treated with MDT. The primary endpoints were PCSS and PFS. The secondary endpoints were time to switch to NEST and NEST-FS.  Results:   The median follow-up time was 19.1 months. Univariate analysis showed that the number of oligoprogressive lesions treated with SBRT and the time between the start of ARTA treatment and oligoprogression were significant prognostic factors for PCSS, and the timing of ARTA treatment (before or after chemotherapy) and the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response after MDT were significant prognostic factors for PFS. Multivariate analysis showed that early MDT for oligoprogressive lesions delivered less than 6 months after the beginning of ARTA and higher PSA levels after MDT were significant predictors of worse PCSS and PFS. The median total duration of ARTA treatment was 13.8 months. The median time between the start of ARTA treatment and the start of MDT for oligoprogressive lesions was 5.2 months, and MDT extended the ARTA treatment by 8.6 months on average. Thirty-two (59.3%) patients continued ARTA treatment after MDT. ARTA treatment after chemotherapy, early oligoprogression requiring MDT, and lower radiation doses for MDT were independent predictors of NEST-FS in multivariate analysis.  Conclusions:   MDT for oligoprogressive lesions is effective and may provide several benefits compared to switching from ARTA treatment to NEST. Patients with early progression while on ARTAs and inadequate PSA responses after MDT have a greater risk of rapid disease progression and poor survival, which necessitates intensified treatment.""","""['Cem Onal', 'Fatih Kose', 'Gokhan Ozyigit', 'Sercan Aksoy', 'Ezgi Oymak', 'Sadik Muallaoglu', 'Ozan C Guler', 'Burak Tilki', 'Pervin Hurmuz', 'Fadil Akyol']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Radiotherapy in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer patients with oligo-progression during abiraterone-enzalutamide treatment: a mono-institutional experience.', 'Stereotactic radiotherapy to oligoprogressive lesions detected with 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.', 'Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with oligoprogression during androgen receptor-targeted therapy.', 'Systematic Review of Efficacy and Health Economic Implications of Real-world Treatment Sequencing in Prostate Cancer: Where Do the Newer Agents Enzalutamide and Abiraterone Fit in?', 'Treating Patients with Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review of Available Therapies.', 'The impact of locoregional treatments for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer on disease progression: real life experience from a multicenter cohort.', 'The impact of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy on oligoprogressive metastases from renal cell carcinoma.', 'Second generation androgen receptor antagonists and challenges in prostate cancer treatment.', 'Radiotherapy in Oligometastatic, Oligorecurrent and Oligoprogressive Prostate Cancer: A Mini-Review.', 'Megestrol Acetate for Heavily Pretreated Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: An Old Answer for a New Problem.']"""

The low rate of infectious complications entails that large sample sizes are required for randomized controlled trials, a challenge given the cost of standard randomized controlled trials. We evaluated infectious complications associated with 1 vs 3 days of prophylactic antibiotics at the time of catheter removal post-RP using a novel, clinically integrated trial with randomization at the surgeon level.  Materials and methods:   Surgeons were cluster randomized for periods of 3 months to prescribe 1-day vs 3-day regimen of prophylactic antibiotics at the time of catheter removal. The primary end point was an infectious complication as routinely captured by nursing phone call within 10 days of catheter removal and defined as positive urine cultures (≥105 CFU) and at least 1 of the following symptoms: fever (>38°C), urgency, frequency, dysuria or suprapubic tenderness.  Results:   A total of 824 patients were consented and underwent RP with, respectively, 389 and 435 allocated to 1-day and 3-day antibiotics, predominantly ciprofloxacin. Accrual was achieved within 3 years: 95% vs 88% of patients received the allocated 3-day vs 1-day antibiotic regimen.

We examined if these patients have impaired surgical, functional and oncologic outcomes compared to those who have no symptom burden of moderate to severe benign prostatic hyperplasia and no previous transurethral resection or laser enucleation of the prostate.  Materials and methods:   We compared 368 robot-assisted radical prostatectomy patients with previous transurethral resection or laser enucleation of the prostate (group A) to 4,945 robot-assisted radical prostatectomy patients without transurethral resection or laser enucleation of the prostate and without moderate or severe benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms (group B) at a high-volume robot-assisted radical prostatectomy center. Multivariable Cox regression analyses assessed impact of transurethral resection or laser enucleation of the prostate on erectile function and urinary continence recovery, biochemical recurrence or metastatic progression. Analyses were repeated after propensity score matching.  Results:   No relevant differences in surgical outcomes, such as surgical margin and 30-day complications rates, were observed. Urinary continence recovery rates at 12 months were 67% vs 74% (group A vs B; p <0.001). Erectile function recovery rates at 24 months were 52% vs 62% (p <0.001). Biochemical recurrence-free rates at 36 months were identical, at 87.3% vs 87.8%. Before and after propensity score matching, transurethral resection or laser enucleation of the prostate negatively affected erectile function recovery (matched HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53-0.88; p=0.003) in multivariable Cox regression analyses. Similarly, transurethral resection or laser enucleation of the prostate had negative effect on urinary continence recovery (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73-0.97; p=0.015) but no effect on biochemical recurrence or metastatic progression.  Conclusions:   Previous transurethral resection or laser enucleation of the prostate does not negatively impact surgical, complication-related, and oncologic outcomes if the robot-assisted radical prostatectomy is performed by highly experienced surgeons.

Materials and methods:   We conducted a retrospective study of 55 patients with mCRPC who received platinum-based chemotherapy after the progression to docetaxel chemotherapy and underwent genomic profiling of 14 homologous recombination (HR) pathway genes. Progression-free survival (PFS) was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   Of 55 patients, 23 harbored genomic defects in HR pathway genes. Median prostate specific antigen (PSA)-PFS for the HR defect group was 6.7 months compared with 2.6 months for the no HR defect group (p=0.001).

Outcomes included definitive FACT-P Total Score (TS) improvements and longitudinal assessment of FACT-P TS.  Results:   In PROSELICA and FIRSTANA, the proportion of patients receiving taxane chemotherapy with a definitive FACT-P TS improvement was significantly higher among patients with versus without a pain or PSA response (pain: PROSELICA: 67% vs. 33.5%; p < .001; FIRSTANA: 75.2% vs. 45.8%; p < .001; PSA: PROSELICA: 50.3% vs. 34.2%; p < .001; FIRSTANA: 49.8% vs. 38.9%; p = .001).

For example, Aggressive Variant Prostate Cancer (AVPC) presents low PSA per tumor burden, and characterized by de novo resistance to androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARIs). Understanding PCa transcriptomic complexity can provide biological insight and therapeutic guidance. However, unsupervised clustering analysis is hindered by potential confounding factors such as stromal contamination and stress-related material degradation.  Materials and methods:   To focus on prostate epithelial cell-relevant heterogeneity, we defined 1,629 genes expressed by prostate epithelial cells by analyzing publicly available bulk and single- cell RNA sequencing data. Consensus clustering and CIBERSORT deconvolution were used for class discovery and proportion estimate analysis. The Cancer Genome Atlas Prostate Adenocarcinoma dataset served as a training set. The resulting clusters were analyzed in association with clinical, pathologic, and genomic characteristics and impact on survival. Serum markers PSA and PAP was analyzed to predict response to docetaxel chemotherapy in metastatic setting.  Results:   We identified two luminal subtypes and two aggressive variant subtypes of PCa: luminal A (Adipogenic/AR-active/PSA-high) (30.0%); luminal S (Secretory/PAP-high) (26.0%); AVPC-I (Immune-infiltrative) (14.7%), AVPC-M (Myc-active) (4.2%), and mixed (25.0%). AVPC-I and AVPC-M subtypes predicted to be resistant to ARI and have low PSA per tumor burden. Luminal A and AVPC-M predicted to be resistant to docetaxel and have high PSA/PAP Ratio. Metastatic PCa patients with high PSA/PAP ratio (>20) had significantly shorter progression-free survival than those with low ratio (≤20) following docetaxel chemotherapy.

By intestinal segment, rectal and large bowel injuries were more common in ORP than MIS-RP (0.41 vs. 0.11% and 0.31 vs. 0.05%, both p < 0.01). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups for small bowel injury (0.17 vs. 0.11%, p = 0.39). Vascular injury was more common in MIS-RP (0.18 vs. 0.08%, p = 0.08). Hernias requiring repair were only identified in the MIS-RP group (0.12%).  Conclusion:   When considering surgical approach, rectal and large bowel injuries were more common in ORP, while vascular injuries and hernia repair were more common in MIS-RP.

In order to increase the chemical stability of the acetalic 1,3-dioxanes 1 and the polarity of the cyclohexanes 2, tetrahydropyran derivatives 3 equipped with the same substituents were designed, synthesized and pharmacologically evaluated. The key step of the synthesis was a lipase-catalyzed enantioselective acetylation of the alcohol (R)-5 leading finally to enantiomerically pure test compounds 3a-g. With respect to σ1 receptor affinity and selectivity over a broad range of related (σ2, PCP binding site) and further targets, the enantiomeric benzylamines 3a and cyclohexylmethylamines 3b represent the most promising drug candidates of this series. However, the eudismic ratio for σ1 binding is only in the range of 2.5-3.3. Classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations confirmed the same binding pose for both the tetrahydropyran 3 and cyclohexane derivatives 2 at the σ1 receptor, according to which: i) the protonated amino moiety of (2S,6R)-3a engages the same key polar interactions with Glu172 (ionic) and Phe107 (π-cation), ii) the lipophilic parts of (2S,6R)-3a are hosted in three hydrophobic regions of the σ1 receptor, and iii) the O-atom of the tetrahydropyran derivatives 3 does not show a relevant interaction with the σ1 receptor. Further in silico evidences obtained by the application of free energy perturbation and steered MD techniques fully supported the experimentally observed difference in receptor/ligand affinities. Tetrahydropyrans 3 require a lower dissociative force peak than cyclohexane analogs 2. Enantiomeric benzylamines 3a and cyclohexylmethylamines 3b were able to inhibit the growth of the androgen negative human prostate cancer cell line DU145.

PDT generates toxic reactive oxygen species as an end product of the interaction between the photosensitizer and light with an appropriate wavelength. Toluidine blue ortho is a photosensitizer that is commonly used in the photodynamic treatment of bacterial infection and a promising photosensitizer for cancer treatment. This study aims to evaluate the potential photo-cytotoxicity of toluidine blue ortho-mediated photodynamic therapy on PC-3 prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   In this study toluidine blue ortho-mediated photodynamic therapy was assessed on PC-3 cancer cells with various photosensitizer concentrations and light energy densities of the 655-nm diode laser. MTT analysis was used for the determination of the cytotoxicity on the cells and viability/cytotoxicity assay was used for live/dead cell staining after the applications. The mechanism of this application was further analyzed with the determination of intracellular reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide release.  Results:   The light applications and the photosensitizer alone did not inhibit the cell viability of PC-3 cells. 20 J/cm2 laser energy density together with 100 μM photosensitizer concentration resulted in maximum cancer cell death with a rate of approximately 89 %. The level of intracellular reactive oxygen species increased with the increasing parameters of the applications that resulted in more cell death.

Methods and materials:   The initial trial randomized 600 patients with IRPC to a 3-arm trial with 200 patients per arm, consisting of 6 months of ADT plus 70 Gy radiation therapy (ADT + RT70) versus ADT plus a DERT of 76 Gy (ADT + DERT76) versus DERT of 76 Gy alone (DERT76). We performed an analysis based on IRF: clinical stage, prostate-specific antigen level, Gleason score, percentage of positive biopsy cores (PBC) ≥50%, and Gleason pattern. Patients were allocated to 2 groups: favorable intermediate risk (FIR), defined as patients with only 1 IRF without Gleason pattern 4 + 3 or PBC ≥50%; and unfavorable intermediate risk (UIR), defined as all other patients. BF, distant metastases, prostate cancer-specific mortality, OS, and DMFS were compared between FIR and UIR.  Results:   The median follow-up was 11.3 years (interquartile range, 10.9-11.7). In the FIR cohort, BF and OS were not significantly different between arms. UIR patients had significantly worse DMFS (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval], 1.61 [1.20-2.15]; P = .026) and OS (1.51 [1.12-2.04]; P = .0495) and a nonsignificant higher cumulative incidence of BF rate (1.55 [0.98-2.47]; P = .08). In UIR patients, a significant improvement in BF was seen in the arms receiving ADT compared to DERT76 alone. On multivariable analysis, Gleason pattern 4 + 3 and prostate-specific antigen >10 ng/mL independently affected BF and OS, regardless of the treatment arm.  Conclusions:   In IRPC, therapeutic optimization appears possible. To avoid ADT side effects, DERT76 alone appears sufficient in patients harboring only 1 risk factor without Gleason pattern 4 + 3 and PBC ≥50% (FIR).

Results:   Mean age was 68.86±8.55 years. Mean PSA and Del-1 protein was 21.72±89.37, 0.099±0.145, respectively. Two hundred seventy-six (60.3%) patients were diagnosed as PCa.

Therapies that reduce androgen exposure remain at the forefront of treatment. However, most prostate cancers transition to a state whereby reducing testicular androgen action becomes ineffective. A common mechanism of this transition is intratumoral production of testosterone (T) using the adrenal androgen precursor dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) through enzymatic conversion by 3β- and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (3βHSD and 17βHSD). Given the ability of prostate cancer to form blastic metastases in bone, we hypothesized that osteoblasts might be a source of androgen synthesis. RNA expression analyses of murine osteoblasts and human bone confirmed that at least one 3βHSD and 17βHSD enzyme isoform was expressed, suggesting that osteoblasts are capable of generating androgens from adrenal DHEA. Murine osteoblasts were treated with 100 nM and 1 μM DHEA or vehicle control. Conditioned media from these osteoblasts were assayed for intermediate and active androgens by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. As DHEA was consumed, the androgen intermediates androstenediol and androstenedione were generated and subsequently converted to T. Conditioned media of DHEA-treated osteoblasts increased androgen receptor (AR) signaling, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) production, and cell numbers of the androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell lines C4-2B and LNCaP. DHEA did not induce AR signaling in osteoblasts despite AR expression in this cell type. We describe an unreported function of osteoblasts as a source of T that is especially relevant during androgen-responsive metastatic prostate cancer invasion into bone. © 2021 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).

The ROC curve analysis determined the cut-offs for the NLR and PLR to be 2.355 and 104.275 respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that being in the poor patient group (NLR ≥2.355 and PLR ≥104.275) was an independent prognostic risk factor and Kaplan-Meier curves analysis revealed that respondents with NLR <2.355 and PLR <104.275 had significantly longer OS and PFS.

EZH2 inhibition substantially increased intratumoral trafficking of activated CD8+ T cells and increased M1 tumor-associated macrophages, overall reversing resistance to PD-1 CPI. Our study identifies EZH2 as a potent inhibitor of antitumor immunity and responsiveness to CPI. These data suggest EZH2 inhibition as a therapeutic direction to enhance prostate cancer response to PD-1 CPI.""","""['Katherine L Morel#', 'Anjali V Sheahan#', 'Deborah L Burkhart', 'Sylvan C Baca', 'Nadia Boufaied', 'Yin Liu', 'Xintao Qiu', 'Israel Cañadas', 'Kevin Roehle', 'Max Heckler', 'Carla Calagua', 'Huihui Ye', 'Constantia Pantelidou', 'Phillip Galbo', 'Sukanya Panja', 'Antonina Mitrofanova', 'Scott Wilkinson', 'Nichelle C Whitlock', 'Shana Y Trostel', 'Anis A Hamid', 'Adam S Kibel', 'David A Barbie', 'Atish D Choudhury', 'Mark M Pomerantz', 'Christopher J Sweeney', 'Henry W Long', 'David J Einstein', 'Geoffrey I Shapiro', 'Stephanie K Dougan', 'Adam G Sowalsky', 'Housheng Hansen He', 'Matthew L Freedman', 'Steven P Balk', 'Massimo Loda', 'David P Labbé', 'Brian M Olson', 'Leigh Ellis']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Nat Cancer""","""['EZH2 inhibition activates dsRNA-interferon axis stress and promotes response to PD-1 checkpoint blockade in NSCLC.', 'Targeting EZH2 Enhances Antigen Presentation, Antitumor Immunity, and Circumvents Anti-PD-1 Resistance in Head and Neck Cancer.', 'Effects and molecular mechanism of histone methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 on regulating sepsis-induced T cell dysfunction.', 'Epigenetic strategies synergize with PD-L1/PD-1 targeted cancer immunotherapies to enhance antitumor responses.', 'Application of PD-1 Blockade in Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'METTL1 promotes tumorigenesis through tRNA-derived fragment biogenesis in prostate cancer.', 'Loss of PHF8 induces a viral mimicry response by activating endogenous retrotransposons.', 'Overcoming acquired resistance to cancer immune checkpoint therapy: potential strategies based on molecular mechanisms.', 'Identification of a polycomb group-related gene signature for predicting prognosis and immunotherapy efficacy in lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Comprehensive Analyses Reveal Effects on Tumor Immune Infiltration and Immunotherapy Response of APOBEC Mutagenesis and Its Molecular Mechanisms in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.']"""

Current targeted therapies for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) are not durable. The exact molecular mechanisms mediating resistance to castration therapy that lead to CRPC progression remain obscure. Methods: The expression of MYB proto-oncogene like 2 (MYBL2) was evaluated in PCa samples. The effect of MYBL2 on the response to ADT was determined by in vitro and in vivo experiments. The survival of patients with PCa was analyzed using clinical specimens (n = 132) and data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (n = 450). The mechanistic model of MYBL2 in regulating gene expression was further detected by subcellular fractionation, western blotting, quantitative real-time PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and luciferase reporter assays. Results: MYBL2 expression was significantly upregulated in CRPC tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of MYBL2 could facilitate castration-resistant growth and metastatic capacity in androgen-dependent PCa cells by promoting YAP1 transcriptional activity via modulating the activity of the Rho GTPases RhoA and LATS1 kinase. Importantly, targeting MYBL2, or treatment with either the YAP/TAZ inhibitor Verteporfin or the RhoA inhibitor Simvastatin, reversed the resistance to ADT and blocked bone metastasis in CRPC cells. Finally, high MYBL2 levels were positively associated with TNM stage, total PSA level, and Gleason score and predicted a higher risk of metastatic relapse and poor prognosis in patients with PCa. Conclusions: Our results reveal a novel molecular mechanism conferring resistance to ADT and provide a strong rationale for potential therapeutic strategies against CRPC.""","""['Qiji Li', 'Min Wang', 'Yanqing Hu', 'Ensi Zhao', 'Jun Li', 'Liangliang Ren', 'Meng Wang', 'Yuandong Xu', 'Qian Liang', 'Di Zhang', 'Yingrong Lai', 'Shaoyu Liu', 'Xinsheng Peng', 'Chengming Zhu', 'Liping Ye']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['miR-30a inhibits androgen-independent growth of prostate cancer via targeting MYBL2, FOXD1, and SOX4.', 'BRD4 Regulates Metastatic Potential of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer through AHNAK.', 'miR-302/367/LATS2/YAP pathway is essential for prostate tumor-propagating cells and promotes the development of castration resistance.', 'Androgen receptor functions in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance to new agents targeting the androgen axis.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'PLAGL2 promotes bladder cancer progression via RACGAP1/RhoA GTPase/YAP1 signaling.', 'The role of Hippo pathway in ovarian development.', 'Comprehensive analysis and molecular map of Hippo signaling pathway in lower grade glioma: the perspective toward immune microenvironment and prognosis.', 'Circular RNA circRILPL1 promotes nasopharyngeal carcinoma malignant progression by activating the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway.', 'The Molecular Biology of Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: From the Past to the Future.']"""

However, little is known about its function in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Objective:   Our objective is to explore the function of PMEPA1 and its potential mechanisms in NSCLC progression.  Methods:   PMEPA1 expression and prognostic significance in adenocarcinoma of lung cancer (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma of lung cancer (LUSC) were determined using Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA). Next, a series of cell assays were performed to examine whether overexpression or depletion of PMEPA1 affected the malignant behaviors of NSCLC H1299 cells, such as proliferation and migration. Luciferase reporter gene assays and SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) were employed to ascertain the regulatory relationship between PMEPA1 and JNK.  Results:   PMEPA1 is overexpressed in LUAD and LUSC tissues and portends a worse prognosis for cancer patients. Gain and loss of function experiments demonstrated that PMEPA1 executes oncogenetic function in H1299 cells. Mechanism studies elucidated that PMEPA1 stimulated the transcriptional activity of the JNK pathway.  Conclusion:   PMEPA1 increased the H1299 cell viability, proliferation, and migration which works, at least partially, by triggering the JNK activity. Hence, our findings support that the PMEPA1/JNK axis might be a promising therapeutic target for this challenging disease.""","""['Benxu Tan', 'Yonghong Chen', 'Lei Xia', 'Xian Yu', 'Yuan Peng', 'Xiaoyue Zhang', 'Zhenzhou Yang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Biomark""","""['System analysis of FHIT in LUAD and LUSC: The expression, prognosis, gene regulation network, and regulation targets.', 'PMEPA1 Stimulates the Proliferation, Colony Formation of Pancreatic Cancer Cells via the MAPK Signaling Pathway.', 'LncRNA GAS5 modulates the progression of non-small cell lung cancer through repressing miR-221-3p and up-regulating IRF2.', 'Rab11-FIP2 suppressed tumor growth via regulation of PGK1 ubiquitination in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Significance of stratifin in early progression of lung adenocarcinoma and its potential therapeutic relevance.', 'Identifying the EMT-related signature to stratify prognosis and evaluate the tumor microenvironment in lung adenocarcinoma.', 'PMEPA1 Serves as a Prognostic Biomarker and Correlates with Immune Infiltrates in Cervical Cancer.']"""

The photon emission energy spectrum, the air-kerma strength, and the dose-rate constant of the model-based dose calculation algorithm (MBDCA)-WG generic Ir-192 source were extracted. For dose calculations, a track-length estimator was implemented. The four Joint AAPM/ESTRO/ABG MBDCA-WG test cases were evaluated through histograms of the local and global dose difference volumes. A prostate, a palliative lung, and a breast case were simulated. For each case, the dose ratio map, the histogram of the global dose difference volume, and cumulative dose-volume histograms were calculated.  Results:   The air-kerma strength was (9.772 ± 0.001) × 10-8 U Bq-1 (within 0.3% of the reference value). The dose-rate constant was 1.1107 ± 0.0005 cGy h-1 U-1 (within 0.01% of the reference value). For all cases, at least 96.9% of voxels had a local dose difference within [-1%, 1%] and at least 99.9% of voxels had a global dose difference within [-0.1%, 0.1%]. The implemented track-length estimator scorer was more efficient than the default analog dose scorer by a factor of 237. For all clinical cases, at least 97.5% of voxels had a global dose difference within [-1%, 1%]. Dose-volume histograms were consistent with the reference data.

IBD-associated CRC (IBD-CRC) may represent a distinct pathway of tumorigenesis compared to sporadic CRC (sCRC). Our aim was to comprehensively characterize IBD-associated tumorigenesis integrating multiple high-throughput approaches, and to compare the results with in-house data sets from sCRCs.  Methods:   Whole-genome sequencing, single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, RNA sequencing, genome-wide methylation analysis, and immunohistochemistry were performed using fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed tissue samples of tumor and corresponding normal tissues from 31 patients with IBD-CRC.  Results:   Transcriptome-based tumor subtyping revealed the complete absence of canonical epithelial tumor subtype associated with WNT signaling in IBD-CRCs, dominated instead by mesenchymal stroma-rich subtype. Negative WNT regulators AXIN2 and RNF43 were strongly down-regulated in IBD-CRCs and chromosomal gains at HNF4A, a negative regulator of WNT-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), were less frequent compared to sCRCs. Enrichment of hypomethylation at HNF4α binding sites was detected solely in sCRC genomes. PIGR and OSMR involved in mucosal immunity were dysregulated via epigenetic modifications in IBD-CRCs. Genome-wide analysis showed significant enrichment of noncoding mutations to 5'untranslated region of TP53 in IBD-CRCs.

How prostate cancer treatment affects these racial disparities is still unclear. Several studies have shown that Black men who receive treatment have a more pronounced decrease in prostate cancer-specific death; however, there remains a large disparity in all-cause mortality. This disparity may be in part related to a higher risk of death resulting from comorbidities, given the higher rates of cardiovascular disease and diabetes in Black men, both of which are complicated by the use of androgen-deprivation therapy. To further understand these disparities, it is important that we analyze the racial differences in adverse event rates and severity. Increasing the percentage of Black men in clinical trials will improve the understanding of the biologic drivers of racial disparities in prostate cancer. To evaluate the potential differences in adverse event reporting and demonstrate the feasibility of enrolling equal numbers of Black and White men in trials, we performed a prospective, multicenter study of abiraterone plus prednisone with androgen-deprivation therapy in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, stratified by race. Racial differences in prostate-specific antigen kinetics and toxicity profile were demonstrated. Higher rates and severity of adverse events related to adrenal hormone suppression, including hypertension, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia, were seen in the Black cohort, not previously reported.

Materials and Methods This retrospective study was composed of patients who underwent a multiparametric prostate MRI and an MRI/transrectal US fusion biopsy between January 2013 and May 2016. A board-certified abdominal radiologist manually segmented the prostate, TZ, and PZ on the entire data set. Included accessions were split into 60% training, 20% validation, and 20% test data sets for model development. Three convolutional neural networks with a U-Net architecture were trained for automatic recognition of the prostate organ, TZ, and PZ. Model performance for segmentation was assessed using Dice scores and Pearson correlation coefficients. Results A total of 242 patients were included (242 MR images; 6292 total images). Models for prostate organ segmentation, TZ segmentation, and PZ segmentation were trained and validated. Using the test data set, for prostate organ segmentation, the mean Dice score was 0.940 (interquartile range, 0.930-0.961), and the Pearson correlation coefficient for volume was 0.981 (95% CI: 0.966, 0.989). For TZ segmentation, the mean Dice score was 0.910 (interquartile range, 0.894-0.938), and the Pearson correlation coefficient for volume was 0.992 (95% CI: 0.985, 0.995). For PZ segmentation, the mean Dice score was 0.774 (interquartile range, 0.727-0.832), and the Pearson correlation coefficient for volume was 0.927 (95% CI: 0.870, 0.957).

Forty-three percentage of all known cluster of differentiation (CD) proteins were identified in the various human urine samples. Interestingly, following comparisons with five recently published urine proteome profiling studies, which applied similar approaches, there are still ~400 proteins which are unique to this current study. These may represent potential disease-associated proteins.

CAFs orchestrate tumor-stromal interactions, and contribute to cancer cell growth, metastasis, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, angiogenesis, immunomodulation, and chemoresistance. However, CAFs have not been successfully targeted for the treatment of cancer. The current study elucidates the significance of glypican-1 (GPC-1), a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, in regulating the activation of human bone marrow-derived stromal cells (BSCs) of fibroblast lineage (HS-5). GPC-1 inhibition changed HS-5 cellular and nuclear morphology, and increased cell migration and contractility. GPC-1 inhibition also increased pro-inflammatory signaling and CAF marker expression. GPC-1 induced an activated fibroblast phenotype when HS-5 cells were exposed to prostate cancer cell conditioned media (CCM). Further, treatment of human bone-derived prostate cancer cells (PC-3) with CCM from HS-5 cells exhibiting GPC-1 loss increased prostate cancer cell aggressiveness. Finally, GPC-1 was expressed in mouse tibia bone cells and present during bone loss induced by mouse prostate cancer cells in a murine prostate cancer bone model. These data demonstrate that GPC-1 partially regulates the intrinsic and extrinsic phenotype of human BSCs and transformation into activated fibroblasts, identify novel functions of GPC-1, and suggest that GPC-1 expression in BSCs exerts inhibitory paracrine effects on the prostate cancer cells. This supports the hypothesis that GPC-1 may be a novel pharmacological target for developing anti-CAF therapeutics to control cancer.""","""['Sukhneeraj P Kaur', 'Arti Verma', 'Hee K Lee', 'Lillie M Barnett', 'Payaningal R Somanath', 'Brian S Cummings']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Paradoxical Role of Glypican-1 in Prostate Cancer Cell and Tumor Growth.', 'Inhibition of Nox4-dependent ROS signaling attenuates prostate fibroblast activation and abrogates stromal-mediated protumorigenic interactions.', 'Zoledronic acid impairs stromal reactivity by inhibiting M2-macrophages polarization and prostate cancer-associated fibroblasts.', 'Regulation of heterogeneous cancer-associated fibroblasts: the molecular pathology of activated signaling pathways.', 'The Role of Glypican-1 in the Tumour Microenvironment.', 'The kinesin KIF20A promotes progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer through autocrine activation of the androgen receptor.']"""

Design, setting, and participants:   We included two prospective series of 121 (FC) and 459 (AS) consecutive patients (2008-2018) for low- to intermediate-risk PCa.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Study outcomes were radical therapy-free or androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)-free, any treatment-free, metastasis-free, and overall survival. A matched pair analysis was performed using seven covariates.  Results and limitations:   The median FC follow-up was 85 mo (interquartile range 58-104); 92 (76%) men had International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade 1. Among matched variables, no significant differences were present except for cT stage and year of entry (both p < 0.01). Ten-year radical therapy-free or ADT-free, any treatment-free, metastasis-free, and overall survival were 51%, 40.2%, 93.9%, and 97%, respectively for FC. No differences were noted with AS (all p > 0.05), with the exception of time to radical therapy, time to radical therapy and ADT, and time to any treatment, all being shorter for AS (all p < 0.01). Freedom from radical treatment or ADT was higher for FC (AS 10 yr 39.3%; p = 0.04). Complications were relatively rare (26.5%) and mainly of low grade (Clavien >2, n = 3); three men developed incontinence (p = 0.0814), while both International Index of Erectile Function 5 and International Prostate Symptom Score scores increased (p = 0.0287 and p = 0.0165, respectively). Limitations include absence of randomization.  Conclusions:   At an early long-term follow-up, FC in the context of mainly low-risk PCa is safe and increases time to radical therapy but does not provide meaningful oncological advantages compared with AS.

Tumoral heterogeneity in PCa creates a significant challenge to develop robust prognostic markers and novel targets for therapy. An analysis of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in PCa may provide insight into progressive PCa. Herein, we exploited a graph-based enrichment score to integrate data from GRNs identified in preclinical prostate orthografts and differentially expressed genes in clinical resected PCa. We identified active regulons (transcriptional regulators and their targeted genes) associated with PCa recurrence following radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   The expression of known transcription factors and co-factors was analysed in a panel of prostate orthografts (n = 18). We searched for genes (as part of individual GRNs) predicted to be regulated by the highest number of transcriptional factors. Using differentially expressed gene analysis (on a per sample basis) coupled with gene graph enrichment analysis, we identified candidate genes and associated GRNs in PCa within the UTA cohort, with the most enriched regulon being JMJD6, which was further validated in two additional cohorts, namely EMC and ICGC cohorts. Cox regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association of the JMJD6 regulon activity with disease-free survival time in the three clinical cohorts as well as compared to three published prognostic gene signatures (TMCC11, BROMO-10 and HYPOXIA-28).  Results:   1308 regulons were correlated to transcriptomic data from the three clinical prostatectomy cohorts. The JMJD6 regulon was identified as the top enriched regulon in the UTA cohort and again validated in the EMC cohort as the top-ranking regulon. In both UTA and EMC cohorts, the JMJD6 regulon was significantly associated with cancer recurrence. Active JMJD6 regulon also correlated with disease recurrence in the ICGC cohort. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed shorter time to recurrence in patients with active JMJD6 regulon for all three clinical cohorts (UTA, EMC and ICGC), which was not the case for three published prognostic gene signatures (TMCC11, BROMO-10 and HYPOXIA-28). In multivariate analysis, the JMJD6 regulon status significantly predicted disease recurrence in the UTA and EMC, but not ICGC datasets, while none of the three published signatures significantly prognosticate for cancer recurrence.  Conclusions:   We have characterised gene regulatory networks from preclinical prostate orthografts and applied transcriptomic data from three clinical cohorts to evaluate the prognostic potential of the JMJD6 regulon.""","""['Mario Cangiano', 'Magda Grudniewska', 'Mark J Salji', 'Matti Nykter', 'Guido Jenster', 'Alfonso Urbanucci', 'Zoraide Granchi', 'Bart Janssen', 'Graham Hamilton', 'Hing Y Leung', 'Inès J Beumer']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancers (Basel)""","""['A TMEFF2-regulated cell cycle derived gene signature is prognostic of recurrence risk in prostate cancer.', 'Five-gene signature associating with Gleason score serve as novel biomarkers for identifying early recurring events and contributing to early diagnosis for Prostate Adenocarcinoma.', 'Meta-analysis of miRNA expression profiles for prostate cancer recurrence following radical prostatectomy.', 'Promoting cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and glycolysis: Glycometabolism-related genes act as prognostic signatures for prostate cancer.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Comprehensive Characterization of the Regulatory Landscape of Adrenocortical Carcinoma: Novel Transcription Factors and Targets Associated with Prognosis.', 'Elucidating the role of PRMTs in prostate cancer using open access databases and a patient cohort dataset.', 'Discovering gene regulatory networks of multiple phenotypic groups using dynamic Bayesian networks.', 'Role of the Epigenetic Modifier JMJD6 in Tumor Development and Regulation of Immune Response.', 'A Personalized Genomics Approach of the Prostate Cancer.']"""

The expression of TMTC4 in PCa and normal prostate epithelial cells was determined by real-time PCR and Western blot analyses. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of TMTC4 was performed on tissues collected from PCa and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Our results show a high expression of TMTC4 on mRNA and protein levels in PCa versus BPH1 and normal cells (p < 0.05). IHC results show strong cytoplasmic expressions in PCa cases (p < 0.001) as compared to BPH cases. The overall accuracy as measured by the AUC was 1.0 (p < 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of the protein were 100% and 96.6%, respectively.

Patients and methods:   During the period from January 2013 to December 2017, clinical and pathological data were collected in 200 patients with nmPCa undergoing RP in the Urological department of Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute. Surgical and apical margins were stated negative and positive, separately. A dichotomous logistic regression model was used to assess clinical and tumor biological features including age, total prostate volume (TPV), biopsy positive cores (BPC), D'Amico risk grade, tumor clinical stage, International Society of Urologic Pathology (ISUP) grade, tPSA, f/t and pelvic lymph nodes (PLN) invasion, and their association with PSMs and PAMs was evaluated.  Results:   Overall, men with nmPCa in this study had a high ISUP grade (58.5% grade 3-5), high risk grade (89.4%) and high clinical T stage (56% cT3-4).

The potential of FT-IR in cancer research lies in its capability of monitoring the biochemical status of cells, which undergo malignant transformation and further examination of spectral features that differentiate normal and cancerous ones using proper mathematical approaches. Such examination can be performed with the use of chemometric tools, such as partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) classification and partial least squares regression (PLSR), and proper application of preprocessing methods and their correct sequence is crucial for success. Here, we performed a comparison of several state-of-the-art methods commonly used in infrared biospectroscopy (denoising, baseline correction, and normalization) with the addition of methods not previously used in infrared biospectroscopy classification problems: Mie extinction extended multiplicative signal correction, Eiler's smoothing, and probabilistic quotient normalization. We compared all of these approaches and their effect on the data structure, classification, and regression capability on experimental FT-IR spectra collected from five different prostate normal and cancerous cell lines. Additionally, we tested the influence of added spectral noise. Overall, we concluded that in the case of the data analyzed here, the biggest impact on data structure and performance of PLS-DA and PLSR was caused by the baseline correction; therefore, much attention should be given, especially to this step of data preprocessing.""","""['Danuta Liberda', 'Ewa Pięta', 'Katarzyna Pogoda', 'Natalia Piergies', 'Maciej Roman', 'Paulina Koziol', 'Tomasz P Wrobel', 'Czeslawa Paluszkiewicz', 'Wojciech M Kwiatek']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cells""","""['Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy combined with chemometric modelling for the classification of clinically relevant Enterococci.', 'Discrimination of grass pollen of different species by FTIR spectroscopy of individual pollen grains.', 'Classification of edible oils and modeling of their physico-chemical properties by chemometric methods using mid-IR spectroscopy.', 'The characterisation of pluripotent and multipotent stem cells using Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy.', 'The Analytical Possibilities of FT-IR Spectroscopy Powered by Vibrating Molecules.', 'Ten quick tips for biomarker discovery and validation analyses using machine learning.']"""

We evaluated the ability of PI-RADS scores in identifying significant prostate cancer, which would help avoid unnecessary prostate biopsies. Materials and Methods: Patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels ≤ 20 ng/mL, who underwent prostate MRI for evaluation from January 2018 to November 2019, were analyzed. Among them, 105 patients who received transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-guided biopsy were included. PSA, PI-RADS scores (low 1-2, high 3-5), biopsy results, and Gleason scores (GS) were evaluated. Biopsies with GS higher than 3 + 4 were considered as significant cancers and biopsies with no cancer or Gleason 3 + 3 were considered insignificant or no cancers. Results: Among the 105 patients, 45 patients had low PI-RADS and 60 had high PI-RADS scores. There were no patients with significant prostate cancer in the low PI-RADS groups. For the high PI-RADS group, 28 (46.7%) patients had significant cancer and 32 (53.3%) had insignificant or no cancer. The sensitivity and specificity of high PI-RADS to detect significant cancer was 100% and 58.4%, respectively. Positive predictive value was 46.7% and negative predictive value was 100%.

The following markers were used: CD45 as a pan-leukocyte marker, BSA-I as a dendritic cell marker, CD11b as an NK cell marker, and CD68 as a marker for macrophages. The labeled immune cells were attributed to the following locations: adjacent adipose tissue, tumor capsule, intra-tumoral septae, and cancer cells directly. In xenograft tumors, the highest score of CD45 and CD11b positive, NK, and dendritic cells were found in the adjacent adipose tissue, followed by lesser infiltration directly located at the cancer cells themselves. The detected numbers of CD45 positive cells differed between the tumor entities: few infiltrating cells in breast cancer, small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma, a moderate infiltration in colon cancer, melanoma and ovarian cancer, strongest infiltration in prostate and pancreatic cancer. In the syngeneic tumors, the highest score of CD45 and CD11b positive, NK and dendritic cells were observed in the tumor capsule, followed by a lesser infiltration of the cancer tissue.

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was used to detect the correlation between the target genes and prognosis and clinical characteristics. Nei endonuclease VIII-like 3 (NEIL3) knockdown cell lines were constructed with RNA interference. Prostate cancer cells were treated with enzalutamide for the androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) model, and with docetaxel and cisplatin for the chemotherapy model. Apoptosis and the cell cycle were examined using flow cytometry. RNA sequencing and western blotting were performed in the knockdown Duke University 145 (DU145) cell line to explore the possible mechanisms. The TCGA dataset demonstrated that high NEIL3 was associated with a high T stage and Gleason score, and indicated a possibility of lymph node metastasis, but a good prognosis. The cell therapy models showed that the loss of NEIL3 could promote the chemotherapy resistance (but not ADT resistance) of prostate cancer (PCa). Flow cytometry revealed that the loss of NEIL3 in PCa could inhibit cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest under cisplatin treatment. RNA sequencing showed that the knockdown of NEIL3 changes the expression of neuroendocrine-related genes. Further western blotting revealed that the loss of NEIL3 could significantly promote the phosphorylation of ATR serine/threonine kinase (ATR) and ATM serine/threonine kinase (ATM) under chemotherapy, thus initiating downstream pathways related to DNA repair. In summary, the loss of NEIL3 promotes chemotherapy resistance in prostate cancer, and NEIL3 may serve as a diagnostic marker for chemotherapy-resistant patients.""","""['Yiwei Wang', 'Liuyue Xu', 'Shanshan Shi', 'Sha Wu', 'Ruijie Meng', 'Huifang Chen', 'Zhenyou Jiang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Loss of NEIL3 activates radiotherapy resistance in the progression of prostate cancer.', 'Overexpression of claspin promotes docetaxel resistance and is associated with prostate-specific antigen recurrence in prostate cancer.', 'miR-375 induces docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer by targeting SEC23A and YAP1.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'ADT with antiandrogens in prostate cancer induces adverse effect of increasing resistance, neuroendocrine differentiation and tumor metastasis.', 'Drug Discovery Targeting Post-Translational Modifications in Response to DNA Damages Induced by Space Radiation.', 'Pan-Cancer Landscape of NEIL3 in Tumor Microenvironment: A Promising Predictor for Chemotherapy and Immunotherapy.', 'Biological Functions of the DNA Glycosylase NEIL3 and Its Role in Disease Progression Including Cancer.', 'A novel DNA damage repair-related signature for predicting prognositc and treatment response in non-small lung cancer.', 'Profile of chimeric RNAs and TMPRSS2-ERG e2e4 isoform in neuroendocrine prostate cancer.']"""

The anticancer activity was tested using five cancer lines viz., SKOV3 cells (ovarian), HeLa (cervical), MDA-MB-231 (breast), PANC-1 (pancreatic), and PC3 (prostate). The toxicity, developmental effect, antiproliferative activity was further tested using zebrafish embryos. The methanolic plant extract had higher polyphenol content than flavonoids. The in vitro study demonstrated a promising antioxidant capacity and DNA protection ability of this plant. The extract also showed cytotoxic activity against SKOV3, HeLa, MDA-MB-23, and PANC-1 cancer cell lines. The in vivo studies on zebrafish embryos demonstrated the extract's ability to suppress the developmental process and elicited more cytotoxicity to cancer cells than developing zebrafish embryos. Moreover, the in vivo studies on zebrafish embryos also indicated the antiproliferative activity of J. repens L. extract.""","""['Chongtham Rajiv', 'Subhra Saikat Roy', 'K Tamreihao', 'Pintubala Kshetri', 'Thangjam Surchandra Singh', 'Haobijam Sanjita Devi', 'Susheel Kumar Sharma', 'Meraj Alam Ansari', 'Elangbam Diana Devi', 'Asem Kajal Devi', 'Pangambam Langamba', 'Heikham Naresh Singh', 'Romila Akoijam', 'Chongtham Tania', 'Chongtham Sonia']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Molecules""","""['Isaria tenuipes Peck, an entomopathogenic fungus from Darjeeling Himalaya: Evaluation of in-vitro antiproliferative and antioxidant potential of its mycelium extract.', 'Taxifolin mitigates oxidative DNA damage in vitro and protects zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos against cadmium toxicity.', 'Anticancer and Antioxidant activity of Zingiber officinale Roscoe rhizome.', 'Comparative study on phenolic, flavonoids and in\xa0vitro antioxidant activity of wild edible plants from Loktak Lake wetland ecosystem under North East Indian Himalayan Region.', 'Phytochemical investigation, in vitro and in vivo antioxidant properties of aqueous and organic extracts of toxic plant: Atractylis gummifera L.', 'Phenolic Profile, Antioxidant and DNA-Protective Capacity, and Microscopic Characters of Ailanthus altissima Aerial Substances.', 'Antioxidant and DNA-Protective Potentials, Main Phenolic Compounds, and Microscopic Features of Koelreuteria paniculata Aerial Parts.', 'Chemical Compounds, Antitumor and Antimicrobial Activities of Dry Ethanol Extracts from Koelreuteria paniculata Laxm.', 'Influence of Systemic Administration of Coq10 Nanoparticles on Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury on Ovaries in Rat.']"""

The target macromolecule or organelle is first enclosed in an autophagosome, and then delivered along acetylated microtubules to the lysosome. Autophagy is triggered by stress and largely contributes to cell survival. We have previously shown that S6K1 kinase is essential for autophagic flux under stress conditions. Here, we aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanism of S6K1 involvement in autophagy. We stimulated autophagy in S6K1/2 double-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts by exposing them to different stress conditions. Transient gene overexpression or silencing, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and ratiometric fluorescence analyses revealed that the perturbation of autophagic flux in S6K1-deficient cells did not stem from impaired lysosomal function. Instead, the absence of S6K1 abolished stress-induced tubulin acetylation and disrupted the acetylated microtubule network, in turn impairing the autophagosome-lysosome fusion. S6K1 overexpression restored tubulin acetylation and autophagic flux in stressed S6K1/2-deficient cells. Similar effect of S6K1 status was observed in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, overexpression of an acetylation-mimicking, but not acetylation-resistant, tubulin variant effectively restored autophagic flux in stressed S6K1/2-deficient cells. Collectively, S6K1 controls tubulin acetylation, hence contributing to the autophagic flux induced by different stress conditions and in different cells.""","""['Aleksandra Hać', 'Karolina Pierzynowska', 'Anna Herman-Antosiewicz']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cells""","""['Rotenone Induces the Formation of 4-Hydroxynonenal Aggresomes.

PIA samples were then selected and classified according to the human classification. The presence of PIA lesions surrounding neoplastic areas was then evaluated to establish a morphological transition from normal to preneoplastic and neoplastic tissue. In addition, the expression of PTEN, P53, MDM2 and nuclear androgen receptor (AR) were analyzed in 20 normal samples and 20 PIA lesions by immunohistochemistry and qPCR. All PIA lesions showed variable degrees of mononuclear cell infiltration around the glands and simple atrophy was the most common histopathological feature. PIA was identified between normal glands and PC in 51 (61%) out of the 84 PC samples. PIA lesions were diffusely positive for molecular weight cytokeratin (HMWC). Decreased PTEN and AR gene and protein expression was found in PIA compared to normal samples. Overall, our results strongly suggest that PIA is a frequent lesion associated with PC.

In the current study, we characterized 12 IRX4 transcripts in PCa cell lines, including seven novel transcripts by RT-PCR and sequencing. They demonstrate unique expression profiles between androgen-responsive and nonresponsive cell lines. These transcripts were significantly overexpressed in PCa cell lines and the cancer genome atlas program (TCGA) PCa clinical specimens, suggesting their probable involvement in PCa progression. Moreover, a PCa risk-associated SNP rs12653946 genotype GG was corelated with lower IRX4 transcript levels. Using mass spectrometry analysis, we identified two IRX4 protein isoforms (54.4 kDa, 57 kDa) comprising all the functional domains and two novel isoforms (40 kDa, 8.7 kDa) lacking functional domains.

Here, we evaluated the feasibility and safety of neoadjuvant chemohormonal therapy (NCHT) before RP for Japanese patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   From February 2009 to April 2016, 21 high-risk patients were enrolled in this prospective study. Patients were treated with docetaxel (70 mg/m2) every four weeks for three cycles and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist. Patients with grade 3-4 toxicities had 25% dose reductions for the following course.  Results:   Median follow-up was 88.6 months. The dose of docetaxel was reduced in 13 patients. The estimated five-year biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS) rate was 57.1%. National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria (high-risk, but not very high-risk (nVHR) versus VHR) was associated with bPFS (p = 0.03). Five-year bPFS rates in the nVHR and VHR groups were 76.9% and 25.0%, respectively. There was a significant difference in bPFS between the nVHR and VHR groups (p = 0.023) by Kaplan-Meier analysis.

In advanced prostate cancer, an upshift of succinate-driven oxidative phosphorylation via mitochondrial Complex II was reported. Here, using untargeted metabolomics, we found succinate accumulation mainly in malignant cells and an anaplerotic effect contributing to biosynthesis, amino acid, and carbon metabolism. Succinate also stimulated oxygen consumption. Malignant prostate cells displayed higher mitochondrial affinity for succinate when compared to non-malignant prostate cells and the succinate-driven accumulation of metabolites induced expression of mitochondrial complex subunits and their activities. Moreover, extracellular succinate stimulated migration, invasion, and colony formation. Several enzymes linked to accumulated metabolites in the malignant cells were found upregulated in tumor tissue datasets, particularly NME1 and SHMT2 mRNA expression. High expression of the two genes was associated with shorter disease-free survival in prostate cancer cohorts.

Two classic cancer hallmarks are a metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) to glycolysis, known as the Warburg effect, and resistance to cell death. Cytochrome c (Cytc) is at the intersection of both pathways, as it is essential for electron transport in mitochondrial respiration and a trigger of intrinsic apoptosis when released from the mitochondria. However, its functional role in cancer has never been studied. Our data show that Cytc is acetylated on lysine 53 in both androgen hormone-resistant and -sensitive human prostate cancer xenografts. To characterize the functional effects of K53 modification in vitro, K53 was mutated to acetylmimetic glutamine (K53Q), and to arginine (K53R) and isoleucine (K53I) as controls. Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity analyzed with purified Cytc variants showed reduced oxygen consumption with acetylmimetic Cytc compared to the non-acetylated Cytc (WT), supporting the Warburg effect. In contrast to WT, K53Q Cytc had significantly lower caspase-3 activity, suggesting that modification of Cytc K53 helps cancer cells evade apoptosis. Cardiolipin peroxidase activity, which is another proapoptotic function of the protein, was lower in acetylmimetic Cytc. Acetylmimetic Cytc also had a higher capacity to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS), another pro-survival feature. We discuss our experimental results in light of structural features of K53Q Cytc, which we crystallized at a resolution of 1.31 Å, together with molecular dynamics simulations. In conclusion, we propose that K53 acetylation of Cytc affects two hallmarks of cancer by regulating respiration and apoptosis in prostate cancer xenografts.""","""['Viktoriia Bazylianska', 'Hasini A Kalpage', 'Junmei Wan', 'Asmita Vaishnav', 'Gargi Mahapatra', 'Alice A Turner', 'Dipanwita Dutta Chowdhury', 'Katherine Kim', 'Paul T Morse', 'Icksoo Lee', 'Joseph S Brunzelle', 'Lisa Polin', 'Prabal Subedi', 'Elisabeth I Heath', 'Izabela Podgorski', 'Katrin Marcus', 'Brian F P Edwards', 'Maik Hüttemann']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cells""","""['Serine-47 phosphorylation of cytochrome c in the mammalian brain regulates cytochrome c oxidase and caspase-3 activity.', 'Phosphorylation of Cytochrome c Threonine 28 Regulates Electron Transport Chain Activity in Kidney: IMPLICATIONS FOR AMP KINASE.', 'Brain-Specific Serine-47 Modification of Cytochrome c Regulates Cytochrome c Oxidase Activity Attenuating ROS Production and Cell Death: Implications for Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury and Akt Signaling.', 'Regulation of mitochondrial respiration and apoptosis through cell signaling: cytochrome c oxidase and cytochrome c in ischemia/reperfusion injury and inflammation.', 'Cardiolipin-cytochrome c complex: Switching cytochrome c from an electron-transfer shuttle to a myoglobin- and a peroxidase-like heme-protein.', 'Raf/MEK/ERK Signaling Pathway Is Involved in the Inhibition of Glioma Cell Proliferation and Invasion in the Ketogenic Microe-nvironment.', 'Cytochrome c lysine acetylation regulates cellular respiration and cell death in ischemic skeletal muscle.', 'Orchestration of Mitochondrial Function and Remodeling by Post-Translational Modifications Provide Insight into Mechanisms of Viral Infection.', 'Unraveling the Peculiar Features of Mitochondrial Metabolism and Dynamics in Prostate Cancer.', 'Cytochrome c in cancer therapy and prognosis.']"""

An alternative is using the MRI for soft-tissue matching with cone beam computed tomography images (MR-CBCT). However, therapeutic radiographers have limited experience of MRI. This study aimed to assess transferability of therapeutic radiographers CT-CBCT prostate image matching skills to MR-CBCT image matching.  Methods:   23 therapeutic radiographers with 3 months-5 years' experience of online daily CT-CBCT soft-tissue matching prostate cancer patients participated. Each observer completed a baseline assessment of 10 CT-CBCT prostate soft-tissue image matches, followed by 10 MR-CBCT prostate soft-tissue image match assessment. A MRI anatomy training intervention was delivered and the 10 MR-CBCT prostate soft-tissue image match assessment was repeated. Limits of agreement were calculated as the disagreement of the observers with mean of all observers.  Results:   Limits of agreement at CT-CBCT baseline were 2.8 mm, 2.8 mm, 0.7 mm (vertical, longitudinal, lateral). MR-CBCT matches prior to training were 3.3 mm, 3.1 mm, 0.9 mm, and after training 2.6 mm, 2.4 mm, 1.1 mm (vertical, longitudinal, lateral). Results show similar limits of agreement across the assessments, and variation reduced following the training intervention.  Conclusion:   This suggests therapeutic radiographers' prostate CBCT image matching skills are transferrable to a MRI planning scan, since MR-CBCT matching has comparable observer variation to CT-CBCT matching.

Herein, we report final efficacy and safety results after unblinding and placebo-to-apalutamide crossover.  Methods:   Patients with mCSPC (N = 1,052) were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive apalutamide (240 mg QD) or placebo plus ADT. After unblinding in January 2019, placebo-treated patients were allowed to receive apalutamide.

However, the total deficit in screening in the US associated with the pandemic and the differential impact on individuals in different geographic regions and by socioeconomic status (SES) index have yet to be fully characterized.  Objectives:   To quantify the screening rates for breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in different geographic regions and for individuals in different SES index quartiles and estimate the overall cancer screening deficit in 2020 across the US population.  Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective cohort study uses the HealthCore Integrated Research Database, which comprises single-payer administrative claims data and enrollment information covering approximately 60 million people in Medicare Advantage and commercial health plans from across geographically diverse regions of the US. Participants were individuals in the database in January through July of 2018, 2019, and 2020 without diagnosis of the cancer of interest prior to the analytic index month.  Exposures:   Analytic index month and year.  Main outcomes and measures:   Receipt of breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer screening.  Results:   Screening for all 3 cancers declined sharply in March through May of 2020 compared with 2019, with the sharpest decline in April (breast, -90.8%; colorectal, -79.3%; prostate, -63.4%) and near complete recovery of monthly screening rates by July for breast and prostate cancers. The absolute deficit across the US population in screening associated with the COVID-19 pandemic was estimated to be 3.9 million (breast), 3.8 million (colorectal), and 1.6 million (prostate). Geographic differences were observed: the Northeast experienced the sharpest declines in screening, while the West had a slower recovery compared with the Midwest and South. For example, percentage change in breast cancer screening rate (2020 vs 2019) for the month of April ranged from -87.3% (95% CI, -87.9% to -86.7%) in the West to -94.5% (95% CI, -94.9% to -94.1%) in the Northeast (decline). For the month of July, it ranged from -0.3% (95% CI, -2.1% to 1.5%) in the Midwest to -10.6% (-12.6% to -8.4%) in the West (recovery). By SES, the largest screening decline was observed in individuals in the highest SES index quartile, leading to a narrowing in the disparity in cancer screening by SES in 2020.

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess the short-term effects of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis, staging, and treatment.  Materials and methods:   Data in the National Prostate Cancer Register (NPCR) of Sweden on newly diagnosed PCa cases and on the number of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures performed between 18 March 2020 and 2 June 2020 were compared with those in the corresponding time periods in 2017-2019, as reported until January 31 of the year after each study period.  Results:   During the study period in 2020, 36% fewer PCa cases were registered in NPCR compared with the corresponding time period in previous years: 1458 cases in 2020 vs a mean of 2285 cases in 2017-2019. The decrease in new PCa registrations was more pronounced in men above age 75 years, down 51%, than in men aged 70-75, down 37%, and in men below age 70, down 28%. There was no decrease in the number of radical prostatectomies and number of radical radiotherapy courses increased by 32%.

Materials and methods:   This prospective study included 544 images (375 pre-treatment cone-beam CT [CBCT] and 169 post-treatment CBCT) from 15 prostate adenocarcinoma patients. We recalculated the dose on each pre-treatment CBCT once the positioning errors were corrected. We also recalculated two dose distributions on each post-treatment CBCT, either using or not intrafractional motion correction. A correlation analysis was performed between CBCT-based dose and rectum and bladder filling as well as intrafraction prostate displacements.  Results:   No significant differences were found between administered and planned rectal doses. However, we observed an increase in bladder dose due to a lower bladder filling in 66% of treatment fractions. These differences were reduced at the end of the fraction since the lower bladder volume was compensated by the filling during the treatment session. A statistically significant reduction in target volume coverage was observed in 27% of treatment sessions and was correlated with intrafractional prostate motion in sagittal plane > 4 mm.  Conclusions:   A better control of bladder filling is recommended to minimize the number of fractions in which the bladder volume is lower than planned.

While CBD is broadly used, including in the self-medication of cancer patients, and CBD-based therapies are undergoing clinical evaluation for cancer treatment, its mechanisms of action are still poorly understood. Methods: In this study, using microarray analysis and Western blot analysis for validation, we attempted to identify the full spectrum of genes regulated by CBD across various aggressive cancer cell lines, including the breast, brain, head and neck, and prostate. Results: We confirmed that ID1 was a major target downregulated by CBD and also discovered that CBD inhibited FOXM1 (Forkhead box M1), a transcriptional activator involved in cell proliferation, while simultaneously upregulating GDF15 (growth differentiation factor 15), a cytokine associated with tissue differentiation.

In this context, the bioproducts of Synadenium grantii have been empirically used in different parts of Brazil for the integrative treatment of prostate cancer in humans. However, there is no availability of scientific evidence of the antitumor effects of S. grantii. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the bioactive compounds in the latex of S. grantii using the high-resolution mass spectrophotometry (HRMS) and to evaluate its cytotoxic effects on primary canine PC cell cultures. Four fragments of phorbol ester were identified as potential bioactive compounds using the HRMS.

Materials and methods:   An hTERT-ADSC.sTRAIL cell line was established by transfection with a lentiviral vector (CLV-Ubic) encoding the human sTRAIL gene. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blots were performed to confirm gene overexpression. An invasion study for the selective migration ability toward PC3 cells was performed. In the in vivo study, the tumor volume in mice treated with ADSC. sTRAIL and CPT-11 was measured.  Results:   Carboxylesterase was generated from hTERT-ADSCs. The gene expression of sTRAIL from hTERT-ADSC.sTRAIL was shown. The directional migration of ADSC.sTRAIL cells toward PC3 cells was significantly stimulated by PC3 cells in vitro (P < 0.05). In the in vitro study, the viability of PC3 cells significantly decreased in the presence of ADSC.sTRAIL (62.7 ± 2.0%) and CPT-11 compared with that of CPT-11 alone (83.0 ± 1.0%) at a cell ratio as low as 0.05 (PC3: ADSC.sTRAIL) (P < 0.05). The proportion of apoptotic PC3 cells significantly increased in the presence of ADSC.sTRAIL (37.2 ± 2.1%) and CPT-11 compared with that of CPT-11 alone (16.5 ± 1.0%) (P < 0.05).

Although in recent years large-scale efforts from international consortia have focused on improving precision oncology, a better understanding of genomic features of BRCA and PRCA in developing regions and racial/ethnic minority populations is still required. Methods: To fill in this gap, we performed integrated in silico analyses to elucidate oncogenic variants from BRCA and PRCA driver genes; to calculate their deleteriousness scores and allele frequencies from seven human populations worldwide, including Latinos; and to propose the most effective therapeutic strategies based on precision oncology. Results: We analyzed 339,100 variants belonging to 99 BRCA and 82 PRCA driver genes and identified 18,512 and 15,648 known/predicted oncogenic variants, respectively. Regarding known oncogenic variants, we prioritized the most frequent and deleterious variants of BRCA (n = 230) and PRCA (n = 167) from Latino, African, Ashkenazi Jewish, East Asian, South Asian, European Finnish, and European non-Finnish populations, to incorporate them into pharmacogenomics testing. Lastly, we identified which oncogenic variants may shape the response to anti-cancer therapies, detailing the current status of pharmacogenomics guidelines and clinical trials involved in BRCA and PRCA cancer driver proteins. Conclusion: It is imperative to unify efforts where developing countries might invest in obtaining databases of genomic profiles of their populations, and developed countries might incorporate racial/ethnic minority populations in future clinical trials and cancer researches with the overall objective of fomenting pharmacogenomics in clinical practice and public health policies.""","""['Nelson M Varela', 'Patricia Guevara-Ramírez', 'Cristian Acevedo', 'Tomás Zambrano', 'Isaac Armendáriz-Castillo', 'Santiago Guerrero', 'Luis A Quiñones', 'Andrés López-Cortés']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Front Pharmacol""","""['A genome-wide association study of prostate cancer in Latinos.', 'Global Assessment of Mendelian Stroke Genetic Prevalence in 101 635 Individuals From 7 Ethnic Groups.', 'Updates in Prostate Cancer Research and Screening in Men at Genetically Higher Risk.', 'Rare Germline Pathogenic Variants Identified by Multigene Panel Testing and the Risk of Aggressive Prostate Cancer.', 'Identification of Germline Genetic Variants that Increase Prostate Cancer Risk and Influence Development of Aggressive Disease.', 'The close interaction between hypoxia-related proteins and metastasis in pancarcinomas.']"""

As the low specificity of PSA results in unnecessary and invasive prostate biopsies, we evaluated the clinical significance of various PSAs and PSA density (PSAD) related to peripheral zones in patients with gray zone PSA level (4-10 ng/mL).  Methods:   A total of 1300 patients underwent transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate biopsy from 2014 to 2019. Among them, 545 patients in the gray zone were divided into the prostate cancer diagnosis group and the non-prostate cancer diagnosis group, and PSA, relative extra transitional zone PSA (RETzPSA), estimated post holmium laser enucleation of the prostate PSA (EPHPSA), PSAD, peripheral zone PSA density (PZPSAD) and extra-transitional zone density (ETzD) were compared and analyzed using receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) analysis after 1:1 matching using propensity score.  Results:   Area under the ROC curve values of PSA, EPHPSA, RETzPSA, PSA density, ETzD, and PZPSAD were 0.553 (95% CI: 0.495-0.610), 0.611 (95% CI: 0.554-0.666), 0.673 (95% CI: 0.617-0.725), 0.745 (95% CI: 0.693-0.793), 0.731 (95% CI: 0.677-0.780) and 0.677 (95% CI: 0.611-0.719), respectively.

Design and setting:   Retrospective cross-sectional single-center study on data covering January 2009 to December 2019.  Methods:   Among 573 male patients who underwent RRP due to prostate cancer, 80 with VUAS were included. They were divided into two groups according to VUAS treatment method: dilatation using Amplatz renal dilators (39 patients); or endoscopic bladder neck incision/resection (41 patients). The Vancouver scar scale (VSS) was used to evaluate the characteristics of scars that occurred for any reason before development of VUAS.  Results:   Over a median follow-up of 72 months (range 12-105) after RRP, 17 patients (21.3%) had recurrence of VUAS. Although the treatment success rates were similar (79.5% versus 78.0%; P = 0.875), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicated that dilatation using Amplatz dilators rather than endoscopic bladder neck incision/resection in patients with VSS scores 4, 5 and 6 may significantly reduce VUAS recurrence.

This study illustrated the function of hepatocyte cell adhesion molecule (HepaCAM) on CRPC cell viability and metastasis.  Methods:   The expression of HepaCAM and p-STAT3 in CRPC tissues were determined by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Cell Counting Kit-8 and colony formation assays were deployed to analyze the growth ability of CRPC cells following the adenovirus-mediated re-expression of HepaCAM. CRPC cell migration and invasion capacity were investigated by wound healing and Matrigel-coated transwell assays, respectively. The messenger RNA or protein levels of p-STAT3, CyclinD1, cMyc, MMP2, MMP9, and VEGF were determined by reverse transcription (RT) followed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and western blot analysis after either HepaCAM re-expression alone or in combination with IL-22 treatment. A CRPC orthotopic xenograft mouse model was applied to investigate the functional effect of HepaCAM on the metastasis of CRPC cells to the lungs.  Results:   The expression levels of HepaCAM were decreased while those of p-STAT3 were elevated in CRPC cells compare with surrounding benign tissues (p < .001). The overexpression of HepaCAM in CRPC cells notably reduced proliferation, migration, and invasion by inhibiting the expression of p-STAT3, CyclinD1, cMyc, MMP2, MMP9, and VEGF (p < .05). In addition, the expression of HepaCAM significantly inhibited the IL-22/p-STAT3 axis and the metastasis of CRPC cells to the lungs.  Conclusions:   Our data suggested that HepaCAM suppressed the viability of CRPC cells via the IL-22/p-STAT3 axis and inhibited the metastasis of CRPC cells from the prostate to the lungs (p < .05).""","""['Bing Tan', 'Xiaoming Chen', 'Yanru Fan', 'Yuanjuan Yang', 'Junjie Yang', 'Li Tan']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['HepaCAM inhibits the malignant behavior of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells by downregulating Notch signaling and PF-3084014 (a γ-secretase inhibitor) partly reverses the resistance of refractory prostate cancer to docetaxel and enzalutamide in vitro.', 'PDLIM2 suppression efficiently reduces tumor growth and invasiveness of human castration-resistant prostate cancer-like cells.', 'ARHGAP15 regulates lung cancer cell proliferation and metastasis via the STAT3 pathway.', 'Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is associated with prostate cancer metastasis and chemo/radioresistance via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.', 'β-elemonic acid inhibits growth and triggers apoptosis in human castration-resistant prostate cancer cells through the suppression of JAK2/STAT3/MCL-1 and NF-ĸB signal pathways.', ""STAT3 and Its Pathways' Dysregulation-Underestimated Role in Urological Tumors."", 'Molecular Landscape of LncRNAs in Prostate Cancer: A focus on pathways and therapeutic targets for intervention.']"""

Biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free, progression-free, overall, and cancer-specific survival (BCRFS/PFS/OS/CSS) rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Wilcoxon test. Cox regression models were used to evaluate candidate prognostic factors for survival. C‑indexes were used to assess model discrimination.  Results:   Within a median follow-up of 84 months, 68 patients experienced BCR, 58 had disease progression including only 3 with local progression, 27 died of any cause, and 2 died from PCa.

The approach dubbed theranostics aims to combine diagnostic techniques with therapeutic ones by deploying the same molecule in two roles, exploiting the specificity of its function to render disease treatment more effective. Does this technical development have the potential to change our conception of disease diagnosis? With the treatment approach so intimately linked to the diagnostic tool, might it be possible to treat a disease without having first made an independent clinical or laboratory diagnosis? Here we discuss medical diagnosis, arguing for three categories of diagnosis, before presenting an example of a theranostic approach using radioactive prostate-specific membrane antigen ligands. This example allows us to envision a form of theranostic agent that would be able to diagnose a cancer, for example, and engage directly in its treatment, opening up the possibility of treating patients at risk of developing this cancer without any other clinical diagnostic steps. Would it be a problem if these approaches eventually became independent of any specialist clinical diagnostic supervision? If a theranostic technique is shown to work, following its own logic, do we still need an independent 'traditional' diagnosis prior to its use? We argue that such a diagnosis would no longer be necessary provided certain conditions are fulfilled.""","""['Jonathan Simon']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Health Care Philos""","""['Changing the Goal Posts: Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Targeted Theranostics in Prostate Cancer.', 'Theranostics for Advanced Prostate Cancer: Current Indications and Future Developments.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'An Impressive Approach in Nuclear Medicine: Theranostics.', 'Animal Models for the Evaluation of Theranostic Radiopharmaceuticals.']"""

In the present study, the mRNA expression level of SNHG17 in 58 pairs of PCa tumor samples and adjacent non-tumor tissues, as well as in PCa tumor cell lines was analyzed. The regulatory effect of SNHG17 on the oncogenic phenotypes of the C4-2 tumor cell line was also investigated. The clinicopathological analysis revealed that SNHG17 mRNA expression level was increased in the PCa tumor samples, and its high expression levels were associated with poor patient outcomes, indicating that SNHG17 may act as a biomarker for the prognosis of PCa. SNHG17 mRNA expression level was also increased in different PCa tumor cell lines. Functionally, SNHG17 increased C4-2 tumor cell growth and aggressiveness by stimulating tumor cell proliferation, survival, invasion and resistance to chemotherapy. Furthermore, SNHG17 promoted in vivo tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model. Notably, the SNHG17-induced in vitro and in vivo oncogenic effects were associated with activation of the β-catenin pathway.

The present study showed that the expression of PCAT6 and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2B1 (hnRNPA2B1) was upregulated in liver cancer tissues compared with non-cancerous tissues and were associated with poor overall survival time, whereas microRNA (miR)-326 expression was downregulated. Moreover, knockdown of PCAT6 significantly inhibited the proliferation and invasion of liver cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. A dual-luciferase reporter gene assay demonstrated that PCAT6 could bind to miR-326 and that hnRNPA2B1 was a direct target gene of miR-326. Mechanistically, silenced PCAT6 suppressed the malignant phenotype of liver cancer cells through upregulating the inhibitory effect of miR-326 on hnRNPA2B1 expression.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulated by circCDR1as and target genes regulated by miRNAs were predicted using bioinformatics software. Prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, 22Rv1 and PC-3), a normal prostate epithelial cell line (RWPE-1) and a human embryonic kidney cell line (293T) were cultured. Relative gene expression was detected using reverse transcription PCR. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting circCDR1as and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) and miRNA mimics were designed and transfected into the cell lines using Lipofectamine® 3000. Cell invasion was determined using a Transwell assay, the cell proliferation rate was detected using an MTT assay and cell migration was examined using a scratch assay. Relative protein expression was detected using western blotting. Double fluorescent reporter gene vectors and an anti-Ago2 RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation assay were used to verify binding. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that there was a binding site between miR-641 and circCDR1as and between miR-641 and XIAP. The expression of circCDR1as and XIAP was higher and the expression of miR-641 was lower in the prostate cancer cell lines compared with the normal prostate epithelial cell line. After effectively reducing the expression of circCDR1as and XIAP and increasing the expression of miR-641 in PC-3 cells, the proliferation, invasion and migration of PC-3 cells were effectively inhibited. circCDR1as could bind to miR-641, which targeted the 3'-untranslated region of XIAP. Reducing the expression of circCDR1 promoted the expression of miR-641 and inhibited the expression of XIAP.

There is a controversy over the superiority of fusion targeted biopsy (fus-MRGB) over cognitive targeted biopsy (cog-MRGB). The present head-to-head randomized controlled trial was performed to compare diagnostic yield of fus-MRGB in combination with SB with cog-MRGB in combination with SB.  Methods:   Biopsy-naive patients with a prostate-specific antigen level between 2 and 10 ng/dL who were candidates for prostate biopsy were included in the study. Multiparametric MRI was performed on all patients and patients with suspicious lesions with Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System score of 3 or more were randomized into two groups. In the cog-MRGB group, a targeted cognitive biopsy was performed followed by a 12-core SB. Similarly, in the fus-MRGB group, first targeted fusion biopsy and then SBs were performed. The overall and clinically significant prostate cancer detection rates between the two study groups were compared by the Pearson χ2 test. McNemar test was used to compare detection rates yielded by SB and targeted biopsy in each study group.  Results:   One-hundred men in the cog-MRGB group and 99 men in the fus-MRGB group were compared.
