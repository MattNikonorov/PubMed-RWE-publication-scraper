Methods:   Within the National Inpatient Sample database we identified 2745 RCC patients treated with either RAPN or OPN between 2008 and 2015, who met the Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups frailty-defining indicator criteria. We examined the rates of RAPN vs. OPN over time. Moreover, we compared the effect of RAPN vs. OPN on short-term postoperative outcomes and total hospital charges. Time trends and multivariable logistic, Poisson and linear regression models were applied.  Results:   Overall, 1109 (40.4%) frail patients were treated with RAPN. Rates of RAPN increased over time, from 16.3% to 54.7% (p < 0.001). Frail RAPN patients exhibited lower rates (all p < 0.001) of overall complications (35.3 vs. 48.3%), major complications (12.4 vs. 20.4%), blood transfusions (8.0 vs. 13.5%), non-home-based discharge (9.6 vs. 15.2%), shorter length of stay (3 vs. 4 days), but higher total hospital charges ($50,060 vs. $45,699). Moreover, RAPN independently predicted (all p < 0.001) lower risk of overall complications (OR: 0.58), major complications (OR: 0.55), blood transfusions (OR: 0.60) and non-home-based discharge (OR: 0.51), as well as shorter LOS (RR: 0.77) but also higher total hospital charges (RR: +$7682), relative to OPN.  Conclusions:   In frail patients, RAPN is associated with lower rates of short-term postoperative complications, blood transfusions and non-home-based discharge, as well as with shorter LOS than OPN. However, RAPN use also results in higher total hospital charges.""","""['Giuseppe Rosiello', 'Carlotta Palumbo', 'Marina Deuker', 'Lara Franziska Stolzenbach', 'Thomas Martin', 'Zhe Tian', 'Alessandro Larcher', 'Umberto Capitanio', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Anil Kapoor', 'Fred Saad', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Surg Oncol""","""['Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Comparative Studies Reporting Perioperative Outcomes of Robot-Assisted Partial Nephrectomy Versus Open Partial Nephrectomy.', ""Functional and oncological outcomes of open, laparoscopic and robot-assisted partial nephrectomy: a multicentre comparative matched-pair analyses with a median of 5\xa0years' follow-up."", 'Open Partial Nephrectomy vs. Robot-assisted Partial Nephrectomy for a Renal Tumor Larger than 4 cm: a Propensity Score Matching Analysis.', 'Robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy provides better operative outcomes as compared to the laparoscopic and open approaches: results from a prospective cohort study.', 'The comparison of perioperative outcomes of robot-assisted and open partial nephrectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Last Resort from Nursing Shortage?

Signatures of single base substitution (SBS) have been extensively studied in different types of cancer. Copy number alterations are important drivers for the progression of multiple cancer. However, practical tools for studying the signatures of copy number alterations are still lacking. Here, a user-friendly open source bioinformatics tool ""sigminer"" has been constructed for copy number signature extraction, analysis and visualization. This tool has been applied in prostate cancer (PC), which is particularly driven by complex genome alterations. Five copy number signatures are identified from human PC genome with this tool. The underlying mutational processes for each copy number signature have been illustrated. Sample clustering based on copy number signature exposure reveals considerable heterogeneity of PC, and copy number signatures show improved PC clinical outcome association when compared with SBS signatures. This copy number signature analysis in PC provides distinct insight into the etiology of PC, and potential biomarkers for PC stratification and prognosis.""","""['Shixiang Wang', 'Huimin Li', 'Minfang Song', 'Ziyu Tao', 'Tao Wu', 'Zaoke He', 'Xiangyu Zhao', 'Kai Wu', 'Xue-Song Liu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""PLoS Genet""","""['Sigflow: an automated and comprehensive pipeline for cancer genome mutational signature analysis.', 'The repertoire of copy number alteration signatures in human cancer.', 'Signatures of copy number alterations in human cancer.', 'Copy number alteration signatures as biomarkers in cancer: a review.', 'An overview of mutational and copy number signatures in human cancer.', 'Identification of hepatocellular carcinoma-related subtypes and development of a prognostic model: a study based on ferritinophagy-related genes.', 'Mutational signature dynamics shaping the evolution of oesophageal adenocarcinoma.', 'Deep learning model accurately classifies metastatic tumors from primary tumors based on mutational signatures.', 'Integrating machine learning and single-cell trajectories to analyze T-cell exhaustion to predict prognosis and immunotherapy in colon cancer patients.', 'Copy number alteration features in pan-cancer homologous recombination deficiency prediction and biology.']"""

Therefore, this study aimed to construct an lncRNA-based signature to more accurately predict the prognosis of different PCa patients, so as to improve patient management and prognosis.  Methods:   Through univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis, this study constructed a 4 lncRNAs-based prognosis nomogram for the classification and prediction of survival risk in patients with PCa based on TCGA data. Then we used the data of TCGA and ICGC to verify the performance of our prediction model. The receiver operating characteristic curve was plotted for detecting and validating our prediction model sensitivity and specificity. In addition, Cox regression analysis was conducted to examine whether the signature's prediction ability was independent of additional clinicopathological variables. Possible biological functions for those prognostic lncRNAs were predicted on those 4 protein-coding genes (PCGs) related to lncRNAs.  Results:   Four lncRNAs (HOXB-AS3, YEATS2-AS1, LINC01679, PRRT3-AS1) were extracted after COX regression analysis for classifying patients into high and low-risk groups by different OS rates. As suggested by ROC analysis, our proposed model showed high sensitivity and specificity. Independent prognostic capability of the model from other clinicopathological factors was indicated through further analysis. Based on functional enrichment, those action sites for prognostic lncRNAs were mostly located in the extracellular matrix and cell membrane, and their functions are mainly associated with the adhesion, activation and transport of the components across the extracellular matrix or cell membrane.  Conclusion:   Our current study successfully identifies a novel candidate, which can provide more convincing evidence for prognosis in addition to the traditional clinicopathological indicators to predict the PCa survival, and laying the foundation for offering potentially novel therapeutic treatment.

PCa is initially androgen-dependent, however, this tumor inevitably progresses as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which represents the most aggressive phase of the pathology. In this work, in two CRPC cell lines (DU145 and PC3), we studied the in vitro inhibitory properties of the tryptophan-derived endogenous metabolite kynurenic acid (KYNA) and of the lactam form of 3-2'-pyrrilonidinyl-kynurenic acid (3-PKA-L), alkaloids usually present in combination in chestnut honey. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, cell colony formation assay, and Western blot analysis of the major mediator proteins involved in apoptotic processes. In all experiments, KYNA was scarcely or not active while 3-PKA-L showed anticancer activity in the high concentration range (0.01 mM - 1 mM) from 24 to 72 h. The results obtained showed that cell death was induced by extrinsic apoptotic pathway, by cell morphological changes and reduction of cell colonies number. These novel results represent the first promising step to the accurate description of 3-PKA-L cytotoxic effect, not observed with KYNA, paving the way to the search of new anticancer agents, as well as to the better understanding of the physiopathological role of this interesting natural product.""","""['Giangiacomo Beretta', 'Roberta Manuela Moretti', 'Rita Nasti', 'Raffaella Cincinelli', 'Sabrina Dallavalle', 'Marina Montagnani Marelli']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Amino Acids""","""['Cytotoxic effects of a triterpene-enriched fraction of Cecropia pachystachya on the human hormone-refractory prostate cancer PC3 cell line.', 'Sanguinarine causes cell cycle blockade and apoptosis of human prostate carcinoma cells via modulation of cyclin kinase inhibitor-cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase machinery.', 'Piperine blocks voltage gated K+ current and inhibits proliferation in androgen sensitive and insensitive human prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Corn silk maysin induces apoptotic cell death in PC-3 prostate cancer cells via mitochondria-dependent pathway.', 'A combination index and glycoproteomics-based approach revealed synergistic anticancer effects of curcuminoids of turmeric against prostate cancer PC3 cells.', ""Chemical Characterization of Honey and Its Effect (Alone as well as with Synthesized Silver Nanoparticles) on Microbial Pathogens' and Human Cancer Cell Lines' Growth."", 'Protective Effect of Thyme and Chestnut Honeys Enriched with Bee Products against Benzo(a)pyrene-Induced DNA Damage.', 'Tetrahydroquinolinone derivatives exert antiproliferative effect on lung cancer cells through apoptosis induction.', 'Dual Effect of Tryptamine on Prostate Cancer Cell Growth Regulation: A Pilot Study.', 'Sophocarpine inhibits tumor progression by antagonizing the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   Samples of normal, benign prostatic hyperplasia and PCa with different Gleason patterns were selected from radical prostatectomy. The intensity, location and percentage of stained cells for PRL and PRLR were evaluated by Immunohistochemistry. Co-localization was observed by confocal microscopy.  Results:   PRL was expressed diffusely and with a mild intensity in the cytoplasm of normal and tumor prostate luminal cells. Its expression only augmented in the Gleason 3 pattern (p< 0.0001). The immunostaining intensity and the percentage of positive cells for PRLR did not vary between normal and tumor tissues. However, the location of the PRLR was modified by the tumorigenic process.In non-tumor tissues, PRLR expression was mostly in plasma membrane in the apical zone of epithelial cells. In tumor tissues, it was expressed in intracellular vesicles.The co-localization of PRL and PRLR was demonstrated in normal and tumor tissues suggesting that PRL could be acting in an autocrine and paracrine manner.

Methods:   We relied on a cohort of 312 men with two suspicious lesions at prostate mpMRI who underwent subsequent targeted biopsy of each lesion (TBx) and concomitant SBx at two tertiary-referral centers between 2013 and 2019. The study outcome was the added value of targeting SL (i.e., the one with a lower PI-RADS score and/or the smaller size compared to IL) in the detection of csPCa. To this aim, we compared different biopsy strategies (SBx + overall TBx vs SBx + IL-targeted biopsy vs SBx + SL-targeted biopsy) and assessed whether SL features could be correlated with detection of csPCa at overall TBx in a multivariable logistic regression model (MVA).  Results:   Overall, 44% of men had csPCa at TBx of all lesions while 39% and 23% of men had csPCa found in IL and SL, respectively. The rate of csPCa found at SBx, IL-TBx, and SL-TBx only was 5%, 6%, and 2%, respectively. The detection rate of csPCa for SBx + IL-TBx was 47%. The addition of SL-TBx increased csPCa detection by only 2% (p = 0.12). At MVA, neither PI-RADS of SL nor the number of cores targeting SL was associated with an increased detection of csPCa (all p > 0.3). Conversely, age (OR: 1.07), PSA (OR: 1.07), prostate volume (OR: 0.98), and PI-RADS of the IL (OR: 2.36) were independently associated with csPCa detection at TBx (all p < 0.01).

This study aimed to evaluate the SelectMDx test to detect high-grade PCa in biopsy-naïve men. Subsequently, to assess combinations of SelectMDx test and multi-parametric (mp) MRI and its potential impact on patient selection for prostate biopsy.  Methods:   This prospective multicenter diagnostic study included 599 biopsy-naïve patients with prostate-specific antigen level ≥3 ng/ml. All patients underwent a SelectMDx test and mpMRI before systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (TRUSGB). Patients with a suspicious mpMRI also had an in-bore MR-guided biopsy (MRGB). Histopathologic outcome of TRUSGB and MRGB was used as reference standard. High-grade PCa was defined as ISUP Grade Group (GG) ≥ 2. The primary outcome was the detection rates of low- and high-grade PCa and number of biopsies avoided in four strategies, i.e., (1) SelectMDx test-only, (2) mpMRI-only, (3) SelectMDx test followed by mpMRI when SelectMDx test was positive (conditional strategy), and (4) SelectMDx test and mpMRI in all (joint strategy). A positive SelectMDx test outcome was a risk score of ≥-2.8. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to assess clinical utility.  Results:   Prevalence of high-grade PCa was 31% (183/599). Thirty-eight percent (227/599) of patients had negative SelectMDx test in whom biopsy could be avoided. Low-grade PCa was not detected in 35% (48/138) with missing 10% (18/183) high-grade PCa. Yet, mpMRI-only could avoid 49% of biopsies, not detecting 4.9% (9/183) of high-grade PCa. The conditional strategy reduces the number of mpMRIs by 38% (227/599), avoiding biopsy in 60% (357/599) and missing 13% (24/183) high-grade PCa. Low-grade PCa was not detected in 58% (80/138). DCA showed the highest net benefit for the mpMRI-only strategy, followed by the conditional strategy at-risk thresholds >10%.  Conclusions:   SelectMDx test as a risk stratification tool for biopsy-naïve men avoids unnecessary biopsies in 38%, minimizes low-grade PCa detection, and misses only 10% high-grade PCa. Yet, using mpMRI in all patients had the highest net benefit, avoiding biopsy in 49% and missing 4.9% of high-risk PCa.

However, the investigation of guideline-concordant PSA surveillance across racial groups is limited. We examined racial differences in PSA surveillance testing 5-years post-definitive treatment for localized prostate cancer.  Methods:   We created a population-based retrospective cohort from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked database for men diagnosed with prostate cancer between the years 2007 to 2011 with Medicare claims through 2016 (N = 21,372). Multivariable log-binomial regression models were used to examine the effect of race on the likelihood of not receiving at least one PSA surveillance test annually 5-years post-definitive treatment.  Results:   Black men had 90%, 71%, 44%, 34%, and 23% increased risk of not receiving at least one PSA surveillance test annually in the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth years of post-definitive treatment follow-up, respectively.

Genomic companion diagnostic tests such as Decipher tend to be tissue destructive, expensive, and not routinely available in most centers. We present a tissue non-destructive method for automated BCR prognosis, termed ""Histotyping"", that employs computational image analysis of morphologic patterns of prostate tissue from a single, routinely acquired hematoxylin and eosin slide. Patients from two institutions (n = 214) were used to train Histotyping for identifying high-risk patients based on six features of glandular morphology extracted from RP specimens. Histotyping was validated for post-RP BCR prognosis on a separate set of n = 675 patients from five institutions and compared against Decipher on n = 167 patients. Histotyping was prognostic of BCR in the validation set (p < 0.001, univariable hazard ratio [HR] = 2.83, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.03-3.93, concordance index [c-index] = 0.68, median years-to-BCR: 1.7). Histotyping was also prognostic in clinically stratified subsets, such as patients with Gleason grade group 3 (HR = 4.09) and negative surgical margins (HR = 3.26). Histotyping was prognostic independent of grade group, margin status, pathological stage, and preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (multivariable p < 0.001, HR = 2.09, 95% CI: 1.40-3.10, n = 648). The combination of Histotyping, grade group, and preoperative PSA outperformed Decipher (c-index = 0.75 vs. 0.70, n = 167).

Recent research implicates HERVs in epigenetic gene regulation. Here we utilize a recently developed bioinformatics tool for identifying HERV expression at the locus-specific level to identify differential expression of HERVs in matched tumor-normal RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Data from 52 prostate cancer, 111 breast cancer, and 24 colon cancer cases were analyzed. Locus-specific analysis identified active HERV elements and differentially expressed HERVs in prostate cancer, breast cancer, and colon cancer. In addition, differentially expressed host genes were identified across prostate, breast, and colon cancer datasets, respectively, including several involved in demethylation and antiviral response pathways, supporting previous findings regarding the pathogenic mechanisms of HERVs. A majority of differentially expressed HERVs intersected protein coding genes or lncRNAs in each dataset, and a subset of differentially expressed HERVs intersected differentially expressed genes in prostate, breast, and colon cancers, providing evidence towards regulatory function. Finally, patterns in HERV expression were identified in multiple cancer types, with 155 HERVs differentially expressed in all three cancer types. This analysis extends previous results identifying HERV transcription in cancer RNA-seq datasets to a locus-specific level, and in doing so provides a foundation for future studies investigating the functional role of HERV in cancers and identifies a number of novel targets for cancer biomarkers and immunotherapy.

However, ICC identification has only moderate inter-reviewer agreement.  Objective:   To investigate quantitative machine-based assessment of the extent and prognostic utility of ICC, especially within individual Gleason grade groups.  Design, setting, and participants:   A machine learning approach was developed for ICC segmentation using 70 RP patients and validated in a cohort of 749 patients from four sites whose median year of surgery was 2007 and with median follow-up of 28 mo. ICC was segmented on one representative hematoxylin and eosin RP slide per patient and the fraction of tumor area composed of ICC, the cribriform area index (CAI), was measured.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The association between CAI and BCR was measured in terms of the concordance index (c index) and hazard ratio (HR).  Results and limitations:   CAI was correlated with BCR (c index 0.62) in the validation set of 411 patients with ICC morphology, especially those with Gleason grade group 2 cancer (n = 192; c index 0.66), and was less prognostic when patients without ICC were included (c index 0.54). A doubling of CAI in the group with ICC morphology was prognostic after controlling for Gleason grade, surgical margin positivity, preoperative prostate-specific antigen level, pathological T stage, and age (HR 1.19, 95% confidence interval 1.03-1.38; p = 0.018).  Conclusions:   Automated image analysis and machine learning could provide an objective, quantitative, reproducible, and high-throughput method of quantifying ICC area. The performance of CAI for grade group 2 cancer suggests that for patients with little Gleason 4 pattern, the ICC fraction has a strong prognostic role.  Patient summary:   Machine-based measurement of a specific cell pattern (cribriform; sieve-like, with lots of spaces) in images of prostate specimens could improve risk stratification for patients with prostate cancer. In the future, this could help in expanding the criteria for active surveillance.""","""['Patrick Leo', 'Sacheth Chandramouli', 'Xavier Farré', 'Robin Elliott', 'Andrew Janowczyk', 'Kaustav Bera', 'Pingfu Fu', 'Nafiseh Janaki', 'Ayah El-Fahmawi', 'Mohammed Shahait', 'Jessica Kim', 'David Lee', 'Kosj Yamoah', 'Timothy R Rebbeck', 'Francesca Khani', 'Brian D Robinson', 'Natalie N C Shih', 'Michael Feldman', 'Sanjay Gupta', 'Jesse McKenney', 'Priti Lal', 'Anant Madabhushi']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Prognostic Significance of Percentage and Architectural Types of Contemporary Gleason Pattern 4 Prostate Cancer in Radical Prostatectomy.', 'High Gleason grade carcinoma at a positive surgical margin predicts biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy and may guide adjuvant radiotherapy.', 'Comedonecrosis Gleason pattern 5 is associated with worse clinical outcome in operated prostate cancer patients.', 'Prognostic significance of lymphovascular invasion in radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Radical prostatectomy for carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Artificial intelligence applications in prostate cancer.', 'Biological insights and novel biomarker discovery through deep learning approaches in breast cancer histopathology.', 'An update on computational pathology tools for genitourinary pathology practice: A review paper from the Genitourinary Pathology Society (GUPS).', 'Cultivating Clinical Clarity through Computer Vision: A Current Perspective on Whole Slide Imaging and Artificial Intelligence.', 'Leveraging artificial intelligence to predict ERG gene fusion status in prostate cancer.']"""

We conducted an investigation of 81 094 men from the UK Biobank, including 3568 prostate cancer cases, to examine the combined effect of rare pathogenic/likely pathogenic/deleterious (P/LP/D) germline variants and common prostate cancer risk variants, measured using a polygenic risk score (PRS), on prostate cancer risk. The absolute risk of prostate cancer for HOXB13, BRCA2, ATM, and CHEK2 P/LP/D carriers ranged from 9% to 56%, and the absolute risk in noncarriers ranged from 2% to 31%, by age 85 yr, for men in the lowest and highest PRS decile, respectively. The high-penetrant HOXB13 G84E prostate cancer risk variant was most common in cases in the lowest PRS quintile (4.4%) and least common in cases in the highest PRS quintile (0.5%; p = 0.005), whereas there was no statistically significant difference in frequencies by PRS in controls. While rare and common variants strongly and distinctly influence prostate cancer onset, consideration of rare and common variants in conjunction will lead to more precise estimates of a man's lifetime risk of prostate cancer.

Methods:   Nineteen prospectively enrolled patients with prostate cancer underwent a PSMA PET/MRI scan, divided into a 1:1 ratio between 68Ga-PSMA-11 and 18F-PSMA-1007, before radical prostatectomy (IWT140193). Four delineation teams performed manual contouring of the GTV based on bpMRI and PSMA PET imaging, separately. Index lesion coverage (overlap%) and interobserver variability were assessed. Furthermore, the distribution of the voxelwise normalized standardized uptake values (SUV%) was determined for the majority-voted (>50%) GTV (GTVmajority) and whole prostate gland to investigate intertracer variability. The median patientwise SUV% contrast ratio (SUV%-CR, calculated as median GTVmajority SUV% / median prostate gland without GTVmajority SUV%) was calculated according to the tracer used.  Results:   A significant difference in overlap% favoring PSMA PET compared with bpMRI was found in the 18F subgroup (median, 63.0% vs 53.1%; P = .004) but was not present in the 68Ga subgroup (32.5% vs 50.6%; P = .100).

Entire classes of regulatory elements are affected by local variations in mutation frequency. However, the underlying mechanisms with functional and genetic determinants remain poorly understood.  Results:   We characterise the mutational landscape of 1.3 million gene-regulatory and chromatin architectural elements in 2419 whole cancer genomes with transcriptional and pathway activity, functional conservation and recurrent driver events. We develop RM2, a statistical model that quantifies mutational enrichment or depletion in classes of genomic elements through genetic, trinucleotide and megabase-scale effects. We report a map of localised mutational processes affecting CTCF binding sites, transcription start sites (TSS) and tissue-specific open-chromatin regions. Increased mutation frequency in TSSs associates with mRNA abundance in most cancer types, while open-chromatin regions are generally enriched in mutations. We identify ~ 10,000 CTCF binding sites with core DNA motifs and constitutive binding in 66 cell types that represent focal points of mutagenesis. We detect site-specific mutational signature enrichments, such as SBS40 in open-chromatin regions in prostate cancer and SBS17b in CTCF binding sites in gastrointestinal cancers. Candidate drivers of localised mutagenesis are also apparent: BRAF mutations associate with mutational enrichments at CTCF binding sites in melanoma, and ARID1A mutations with TSS-specific mutagenesis in pancreatic cancer.  Conclusions:   Our method and catalogue of localised mutational processes provide novel perspectives to cancer genome evolution, mutagenesis, DNA repair and driver gene discovery.

All MRI examinations were performed on a 1.5-T machine using a prostate-specific protocol for the prostatitis group and different protocols that included high-resolution small field of view T2-weighted (T2WI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), for the control group, depending on the clinical indication.  Results:   Four different T2WI intensity patterns were observed: hyperintense homogenous; slightly to moderate homogenous hypointense; inhomogeneous; and marked hypointense. We found statistically significant differences between the two analyzed groups regarding mean ADC values (P<0.001), distribution of T2WI intensity patterns (P<0.0001), and the presence of dilated venous plexus (P=0.0007). No differences were found regarding prostate volume (P=0.15). In multivariate analysis, all four analyzed imaging parameters were independent predictors of chronic prostatitis (R2=0.67; P<0.0001). Considered together, an age >28 years, an inhomogeneous or marked hypointense T2WI intensity pattern (types 3 and 4), an ADC value ≤1250, and the presence of dilated venous plexus are able to predict CP with an AUC of 93% (sensitivity=85.1%, specificity=88.4%).  Conclusion:   MR parameters like T2WI intensity patterns, ADC values, and venous plexus appearance are promising non-invasive tools in the challenging environment of CP diagnosis.""","""['Andrei Lebovici', 'Csaba Csutak', 'Paula Popa', 'Nicolae Crișan', 'Mihai Suciu', 'Bogdan Feciche', 'Iulia Andraș', 'Paul-Andrei Ștefan', 'Diana Sorina Feier']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Acta Radiol""","""['Differentiation of prostatitis and prostate cancer using the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS).', 'Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in the prostate transition zone: histopathological validation using magnetic resonance-guided biopsy specimens.', 'Application evaluation of multi-parametric MRI in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of early prostate cancer and prostatitis.', 'Diffusion-weighted MRI of the prostate.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'CT-Based Radiomic Analysis May Predict Bacteriological Features of Infected Intraperitoneal Fluid Collections after Gastric Cancer Surgery.', 'Quantitative MRI of Pancreatic Cystic Lesions: A New Diagnostic Approach.']"""

This study aimed at assessing the number of new cancers during and after the lockdown.  Methods:   We prospectively collected the clinical data of the 11.4 million patients referred to the Assistance Publique Hôpitaux de Paris Teaching Hospital. We identified new cancer cases between 1st January 2018 and 31st September 2020 and compared indicators for 2018 and 2019 to 2020 with a focus on the French lockdown (17th March to 11th May 2020) across cancer types and patient age classes.  Results:   Between January and September, 28,348, 27,272 and 23,734 new cancer cases were identified in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The monthly median number of new cases reached 3168 (interquartile range, IQR, 3027; 3282), 3054 (IQR 2945; 3127) and 2723 (IQR 2085; 2,863) in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. From March 1st to May 31st, new cancer decreased by 30% in 2020 compared to the 2018-19 average; then by 9% from 1st June to 31st September. This evolution was consistent across all tumour types: -30% and -9% for colon, -27% and -6% for lung, -29% and -14% for breast, -33% and -12% for prostate cancers, respectively. For patients aged <70 years, the decrease of colorectal and breast new cancers in April between 2018 and 2019 average and 2020 reached 41% and 39%, respectively.

FCH PET/CT is not recommended for the primary staging of metastases in the European guidelines for prostate cancer. However, it has been an option in the Swedish recommendations. Our aim was to assess PET/CT for primary staging of lymph node metastases before robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) with extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) in patients with intermediate or high-risk prostate cancer.  Method:   We identified all men with prostate cancer undergoing FCH PET/CT for initial staging followed by RALP and ePLND at Skåne University Hospital between 2015 and 2018. The result from PET/CT scan was compared with pathology report as the reference method for calculation of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV).  Results:   In total, 252 patients were included in the final analysis. Among 85 patients with a suspicion of regional lymph node metastases on FCH PET/CT only 31 had pathology-proven metastases. The sensitivity was 43% (95% CI 0.32-0.55) and the specificity 70% (95% CI 0.63-0.76) for PET/CT to predict lymph node metastases. PPV was 36% and NPV was 75%.

The main outcomes were survival at one, two, and five years for sixteen cancer types in 1,206,821 patients. We found that uninsured patients ages 60-64 were nearly twice as likely to present with late-stage disease and were significantly less likely to receive surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy than Medicare beneficiaries ages 66-69, despite lower comorbidity among younger patients. Compared with older Medicare patients, younger uninsured patients had strikingly lower five-year survival across cancer types. For instance, five-year survival in younger uninsured patients with late-stage breast or prostate cancer was 5-17 percent lower than that among older Medicare patients. We conclude that survival after a diagnosis of cancer is considerably lower in younger uninsured patients than in older Medicare patients.

This educational report is designed to provide information about our quality high-dose 125 I seed implantation monotherapy technique in which a biologically effective dose (BED) ≧ 200 Gy is applied for treatment of intermediate-risk prostate cancer. This protocol is named the ""Ten-step Method,"" where the rationale and principle of the method are based on the following four goals: (1) The entire prostate should be covered by the prescription isodose distribution with a sufficient margin from the prostatic capsule, achieving high D90 and V100 values by 125 I seed implantation. (2) The high-dose cloud (240 Gy) should not invade the urethra or rectum. (3) In order to achieve goals (1) and (2), make the high-dose cloud intentionally along the periphery (bilateral wall to anterior wall) away from the urethra and rectum. (4) In order to achieve goal (3), seeds at the periphery, except those anterior to the rectal wall, should be placed just 1mm inside the capsule. The data obtained from a total of 137 patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with low-dose-rate (LDR) monotherapy are shown. The dosimetry parameters were monitored at 1 month after seed implantation by using CT and MRI fusion guidance. The data at 1 month after LDR were: Average D90, BED, and V100 of 125 I LDR monotherapy were 194.1 Gy, 207.3 Gy, and 99%, respectively.

Methods:   We analyzed data on 20,582 patients with breast, colorectal, gynecological, lung, and prostate cancers who had attended cancer outpatient clinics in Scotland, United Kingdom. Patients had completed two-stage screening for major depression as part of their cancer care. These data on depression status were linked to demographic, cancer, and subsequent mortality data from national databases. We estimated the association of major depression with survival for each cancer using Cox regression. We adjusted for potential confounders and interactions between potentially time-varying confounders and the interval between cancer diagnosis and depression screening, and used multiple imputation for missing depression and confounder data. We pooled the cancer-specific results using fixed-effects meta-analysis.  Results:   Major depression was associated with worse survival for all cancers, with similar adjusted hazard ratios (HRs): breast cancer (HR = 1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.15-1.75), colorectal cancer (HR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.11-1.94), gynecological cancer (HR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.08-1.71), lung cancer (HR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.24-1.56), and prostate cancer (HR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.08-2.85).

The incidence, outcomes, and mechanisms in real-world clinical settings of these CV adverse effects to date have not been fully elucidated. Our study identified a patient with sipuleucel-T-induced inflammatory cardiomyopathy, which led to the identification of CV adverse effects associated with sipuleucel-T from a large pharmacovigilance database and elucidation of its potential mechanisms.  Methods and results:   Using the MedDRA term 'cardiac disorders' (System Organ Class level), CV adverse events associated with sipuleucel-T versus all other drugs were reviewed from VigiBase, a large pharmacovigilance database. Disproportionality analysis was calculated by the information component (IC), a Bayesian disproportionality indicator. A positive IC025 (IC 95% lower end credibility interval) value (>0) is the traditional threshold used in statistical signal detection at the Uppsala Monitoring Centre. From VigiBase, the total number of CV adverse drug reaction reported with sipuleucel-T was 306 out of a total of 22 980 104 adverse drug reactions in VigiBase on 10/25/2020. MedDRA preferred terms levels were grouped into major CV adverse drug reaction categories where we observed significant reports of myocardial ischaemia, supraventricular tachycardia (particularly atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter), congestive heart failure, and valvular disorders. Myocardial ischemia included acute myocardial infarction (IC025 2.3) with n = 4/26 (15%) of these individual case safety reports considered fatal. Among patients with 'cardiac failure congestive' (IC025 1.5), 11 of these 43 cases (26%) were fatal with 42 (98%) of these cases considered to be solely due to sipuleucel-T.  Conclusions:   Patients with CV risk factors who are receiving sipuleucel-T may be at higher risk for congestive heart failure, myocardial ischemia, and supraventricular tachycardia.

Misregulation of AR is a major driver of prostate cancer (PC). The primary agonist of full-length AR is testosterone, whereas its splice variants, for example, AR-v7 implicated in cancer may lack a ligand-binding domain and are thus devoid of proper hormonal control. Recently, it was demonstrated that full-length AR, but not AR-v7, can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in a cellular model of PC. In a detailed bioinformatics and deletion analysis, we have analyzed which AR region is responsible for LLPS. We found that its DNA-binding domain (DBD) can bind RNA and can undergo RNA-dependent LLPS. RNA regulates its LLPS in a reentrant manner, that is, it has an inhibitory effect at higher concentrations. As RNA binds DBD more weakly than DNA, while both RNA and DNA localizes into AR droplets, its LLPS depends on the relative concentration of the two nucleic acids. The region immediately preceding DBD has no effect on the LLPS propensity of AR, whereas the functional part of its long N-terminal disordered transactivation domain termed activation function 1 (AF1) inhibits AR-v7 phase separation. We suggest that the resulting diminished LLPS tendency of AR-v7 may contribute to the misregulation of the transcription function of AR in prostate cancer.""","""['Junaid Ahmed', 'Attila Meszaros', 'Tamas Lazar', 'Peter Tompa']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Protein Sci""","""['Inhibiting androgen receptor splice variants with cysteine-selective irreversible covalent inhibitors to treat prostate cancer.', 'The RNA-binding protein Sam68 regulates expression and transcription function of the androgen receptor splice variant AR-V7.', 'Combination therapy with androgen receptor N-terminal domain antagonist EPI-7170 and enzalutamide yields synergistic activity in AR-V7-positive prostate cancer.', 'The impact of the androgen receptor splice variant AR-V7 on the prognosis and treatment of advanced prostate cancer.', 'AR-V7 in Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Strategy beyond Redemption.', 'Phase separation propensity of the intrinsically disordered AB region of human RXRβ.', 'Phase-separation: a possible new layer for transcriptional regulation by glucocorticoid receptor.', 'A Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation-Related Index Associate with Biochemical Recurrence and Tumor Immune Environment of Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Inhibiting androgen receptor splice variants with cysteine-selective irreversible covalent inhibitors to treat prostate cancer.', 'Dynamic phase separation of the androgen receptor and its coactivators key to regulate gene expression.']"""

Indeed, 57% of all new cancer cases around the world occur in low income countries exacerbated by lack of awareness, lack of preventive strategies, and increased life expectancies. Despite recent efforts devoted to cancer epidemiology, statistics on cancer rates in Africa are often dispersed across different registries. In this study our goal included identifying the most promising prevention and treatment approaches available in Africa. To do this, we collated and analyzed the incidence and fatality rates for the 10 most common and fatal cancers in 56 African countries grouped into 5 different regions (North, West, East, Central and South) over 16-years (2002-2018). We examined temporal and regional trends by investigating the most important risk factors associated to each cancer type. Data were analyzed by cancer type, African region, gender, measures of socioeconomic status and the availability of medical devices.  Results:   We observed that Northern and Southern Africa were most similar in their cancer incidences and fatality rates compared to other African regions. The most prevalent cancers are breast, bladder and liver cancers in Northern Africa; prostate, lung and colorectal cancers in Southern Africa; and esophageal and cervical cancer in East Africa. In Southern Africa, fatality rates from prostate cancer and cervical cancer have increased. In addition, these three cancers are less fatal in Northern and Southern Africa compared to other regions, which correlates with the Human Development Index and the availability of medical devices. With the exception of thyroid cancer, all other cancers have higher incidences in males than females.  Conclusion:   Our results show that the African continent suffers from a shortage of medical equipment, research resources and epidemiological expertise. While recognizing that risk factors are interconnected, we focused on risk factors more or less specific to each cancer type. This helps identify specific preventive and therapeutic options in Africa. We see a need for implementing more accurate preventive strategies to tackle this disease as many cases are likely preventable. Opportunities exist for vaccination programs for cervical and liver cancer, genetic testing and use of new targeted therapies for breast and prostate cancer, and positive changes in lifestyle for lung, colorectal and bladder cancers. Such recommendations should be tailored for the different African regions depending on their disease profiles and specific needs.""","""['Yosr Hamdi', 'Ines Abdeljaoued-Tej', 'Afzal Ali Zatchi', 'Sonia Abdelhak', 'Samir Boubaker', 'Joel S Brown', 'Alia Benkahla']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""['Prostate Cancer Disparities and Management in Southern Africa: Insights into Practices, Norms and Values.', 'Mortality Atlas of the Campania Region.

Methods:   We created a drug comorbidity index from age-stratified univariable associations between filled drug prescriptions and time to death in 326,450 control males randomly selected from the general population to men with prostate cancer. We also evaluated the index in 272,214 control females randomly selected from the general population to women with breast cancer.  Results:   The new drug comorbidity index predicted survival better than the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and a previously published prescription index during 11 years of follow-up. The concordance (C)-index for the new index was 0.73 in male and 0.76 in the female population, as compared with a C-index of 0.67 in men and 0.69 in women for the CCI. In men of age 75-84 years with CCI = 0, the median survival time was 7.1 years (95% confidence interval [CI] = 7.0, 7.3) in the highest index quartile. Comparing the highest to the lowest drug comorbidity index quartile resulted in a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.2 among men (95% CI = 2.1, 2.3) and 2.4 among women (95% CI = 2.3, 2.6).  Conclusions:   A new drug comorbidity index based on filled drug prescriptions improved prediction of survival beyond age and the CCI alone.

Objective:   The aim of this study was to undertake biochemical evaluation of anticancer activities of green synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) from ethanolic extracts of fruits (AgNPs-F) and leaves (AgNPs-L) of Annona muricata.  Methods:   Previously synthesized silver nanoparticles were used for the study. The effects of the AgNPs and 5-Fluorouracil were studied on PC3, HeLa and PNT1A cells. The resazurin, migration and colonogenic assays as well as qRT-PCR were employed.  Results:   The AgNPs-F displayed significant antiproliferative effects against HeLa cells with an IC50 of 38.58μg/ml and PC3 cells with an IC50 of 48.17μg/ml but selectively spared normal PNT1A cells (selectivity index of 7.8), in comparison with first line drug 5FU and AgNPs-L whose selectivity index were 3.56 and 2.26 respectively. The migration assay revealed potential inhibition of the metastatic activity of the cells by the AgNPs-F while the colonogenic assay indicated the permanent effect of the AgNPs-F on the cancer cells yet being reversible on the normal cells in contrast with 5FU and AgNPs-L. CASP9 was significantly over expressed in all HeLa cells treated with the AgNPs-F (1.53-fold), AgNPs-L (1.52-fold) and 5FU (4.30-fold). CXCL1 was under expressed in HeLa cells treated with AgNPs-F (0.69-fold) and AgNPs-L (0.58-fold) and over expressed in cells treated with 5FU (4.95-fold), but the difference was not statistically significant. CXCR2 was significantly over expressed in HeLa cells treated with 5FU (8.66-fold) and AgNPs-F (1.12-fold) but under expressed in cells treated with AgNPs-L (0.76-fold).  Conclusions:   Here we show that biosynthesized AgNPs especially AgNPs-F can be used in the development of novel and better anticancer drugs.

Aim:   The aim of this study is to report functional outcomes and PROs of total glans resurfacing (TGR) in a consecutive series of patients with lichen sclerosis (LS) or localized penile cancer (PC).  Methods:   From 2004 to 2018 a consecutive series of patients underwent TGR for the management of LS or localized PC in a tertiary referral network. Patient clinical records and operative notes were retrospectively reviewed. Statistical analysis was conducted with Stata 12.  Outcomes:   Urinary and sexual outcomes were recorded utilizing both the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) validated questionnaires while PROs were extrapolated from a 5-item ""ad hoc"" telephone questionnaire administered at 1 year post procedure.  Results:   37 consecutive patients were enrolled. Histology results demonstrated LS in 16 patients, with the remaining 21 having a diagnosis of PC. The most common reasons for patient presentation were local pain (32.4%), pruritus (37.8%) and bleeding (29.7%). Median follow-up was 22 (IQR 13-77) months. Median age was 62 (IQR 55-68). Neither of the questionnaires assessing urinary and sexual function showed any significant deterioration after surgery. Glans sensitivity was fully maintained in 89.2% of cases. 94.5% of patients reported to be fully satisfied with the aesthetic appearance of the penis and would consider undergoing the same procedure again if necessary. 91.9% of patients would recommend the same procedure to someone else. An overall improvement of the quality of life was reported by 86.4% of patients.  Clinical implications:   TGR should be considered a treatment of choice for selected cases of benign or malignant penile lesions STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: Our study has some limitations, the first being its retrospective nature. Furthermore, despite being one of the largest series to date, follow-up duration is somewhat limited and a control group is lacking.

We therefore emulated a hypothetical target clinical trial of radical prostatectomy (RP) versus external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for high-grade, clinically localized prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We conducted observational analyses using the National Cancer Database from 2006-2015 to emulate a target clinical trial in men 55-69 years with cT1-3cN0cM0, PSA<20 ng/mL, Gleason 8 to 10 prostate adenocarcinoma treated with RP or 75 to 81 Gy EBRT with androgen deprivation therapy (EBRT+ADT). The associations of treatment type with overall survival (OS) were estimated using Cox regression with stabilized inverse probability weights (IPW).  Results:   A total of 26,806 men formed the study cohort (RP: 23,990; EBRT+ADT: 2,816). Baseline characteristics were well-balanced after IPW-adjustment. Median follow-up was 48.4 (IQR 25.5-76.2) months. After IPW-reweighting, RP was associated with improved OS compared to EBRT+ADT (HR 0.54;95% CI 0.48-0.62; P<0.001), with 5- and 10-year OS of 93% vs 87%, and 76% vs 60%, respectively. RP was associated with improved OS across all categories of Gleason score, PSA, cT stage, age, and Charlson comorbidity index examined. In sensitivity analyses adjusting for biopsy tumor volume and a biopsy-specific Gleason score, RP remained associated with improved OS compared to EBRT+ADT (HR 0.62;95% CI 0.49-0.78; P<0.001).

Aim:   Using a large commercial claims database, we aimed to determine the most recent rates of PSA testing for privately insured men age 30 to 64 in the context of screening recommendations.  Methods and results:   Data from employer plans were from MarketScan commercial claims database. Annual PSA testing rate was the proportion of men with ≥1 paid test(s) per 12 months of continuous enrollment. Men with diagnosis of any prostate-related condition were excluded. Annual percent change (APC) in PSA test use was estimated using joinpoint regression analysis. In 2011 to 2017, annual testing rate encompassing 5.02 to 5.53 million men was approximately 1.4%, age 30 to 34; 3.4% to 4.1%, age 35 to 39; 11% to 13%, age 40 to 44; 18% to 21%, age 45 to 49; 31% to 33%, age 50 to 54; 35% to 37%, age 55 to 59; and 38% to 41%, age 60 to 64.

In the context of prostate cancer (PCa), however, their establishment has been hampered by poor success rates, which impedes their broad use for translational research applications. Along with the necessity to improve culture conditions, there is a need to identify factors influencing outcomes and to determine how to assess success versus failure in organoid generation. In the present study, we report our unbiased efforts to generate PDOs from a cohort of 81 PCa specimens with diverse pathological and clinical features. We comprehensively analyzed histological features of each enrolled sample (Gleason score, tumor content, proliferation index) and correlated them with organoid growth patterns. We identified improved culture conditions favoring the generation of PCa organoids, yet no specific intrinsic tumor feature was broadly associated with sustained organoid growth. In addition, we performed phenotypic and molecular characterization of tumor-organoid pairs using immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and targeted sequencing. Morphological and immunohistochemical profiles of whole organoids altogether provided a fast readout to identify the most promising ones. Notably, primary samples were associated with an initial take-rate of 83% (n = 60/72) in culture, with maintenance of cancer cells displaying common PCa alterations, such as PTEN loss and ERG overexpression. These cancer organoids were, however, progressively overgrown by organoids with a benign-like phenotype. Finally, out of nine metastasis samples, we generated a novel organoid model derived from a hormone-naïve lung metastasis, which displays alterations in the PI3K/Akt and Wnt/β-catenin pathways and responds to androgen deprivation.

Here, we identified a novel immune-related gene-based prognostic signature (IRGPS) to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy. We also explored the correlation between IRGPS and tumor microenvironment. We identified an IRGPS consisting of seven immune-related genes (PPARGC1A, AKR1C2, COMP, EEF1A2, IRF5, NTM, and TPX2) that were related to the BCR-free survival of PCa patients. The high-risk patients exhibited a higher fraction of regulatory T cells and M2 macrophages than the low-risk BCR patients (P < 0.05) as well as a lower fraction of resting memory CD4 T cells and resting mast cells. These high-risk patients also had higher expression levels of CTLA4, TIGIT, PDCD1, LAG3, and TIM3. Finally, a strong correlation was detected between IRGPS and specific clinicopathological features, including Gleason scores and tumor stage. In conclusion, our study reveals the clinical significance and potential functions of the IRGPS, provides more data for predicting outcomes, and suggests more effective immunotherapeutic target strategies for PCa.""","""['Daojun Lv', 'Xiangkun Wu', 'Xi Chen', 'Shuxin Yang', 'Wenzhe Chen', 'Ming Wang', 'Yongda Liu', 'Di Gu', 'Guohua Zeng']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Immunol Immunother""","""['Development and Validation of an Individualized Immune Prognostic Signature for Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'Tumor infiltrating M2 macrophages could predict biochemical recurrence of localized prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Developing an immune-related gene prognostic index associated with progression and providing new insights into the tumor immune microenvironment of prostate cancer.', 'Tissue-Based MicroRNAs as Predictors of Biochemical Recurrence after Radical Prostatectomy: What Can We Learn from Past Studies?', 'Prognostic significance of lymphovascular invasion in radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Transcriptomic Establishment of Pig Macrophage Polarization Signatures.', 'An epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related mRNA signature associated with the prognosis, immune infiltration and therapeutic response of colon adenocarcinoma.', 'Comprehensive analysis regarding the prognostic significance of downregulated ferroptosis-related gene AKR1C2 in gastric cancer and its underlying roles in immune response.', 'A lncRNA-immune checkpoint-related gene signature predicts metastasis-free survival in prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'TGF-β Pathways Stratify Colorectal Cancer into Two Subtypes with Distinct Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix Protein (COMP) Expression-Related Characteristics.']"""

Currently, there is no randomised comparative effectiveness data evaluating cancer control of both strategies.  Methods:   Following the eligibility criteria PSA < 20 ng/mL, Gleason score ≤ 7 and T-stage ≤ T2c, we included 830 radical (440 radiotherapy, 390 prostatectomy) and 530 focal therapy (cryotherapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound or high-dose-rate brachytherapy) patients treated between 2005 and 2018 from multicentre registries in the Netherlands and the UK. A propensity score weighted (PSW) analysis was performed to compare failure-free survival (FFS), with failure defined as salvage treatment, metastatic disease, systemic treatment (androgen deprivation therapy or chemotherapy), or progression to watchful waiting. The secondary outcome was overall survival (OS). Median (IQR) follow-up in each cohort was 55 (28-83) and 62 (42-83) months, respectively.  Results:   At baseline, radical patients had higher PSA (10.3 versus 7.9) and higher-grade disease (31% ISUP 3 versus 11%) compared to focal patients. After PSW, all covariates were balanced (SMD < 0.1). 6-year weighted FFS was higher after radical therapy (80.3%, 95% CI 73.9-87.3) than after focal therapy (72.8%, 95% CI 66.8-79.8) although not statistically significant (p = 0.1). 6-year weighted OS was significantly lower after radical therapy (93.4%, 95% CI 90.1-95.2 versus 97.5%, 95% CI 94-99.9; p = 0.02). When compared in a three-way analysis, focal and LRP patients had a higher risk of treatment failure than EBRT patients (p < 0.001), but EBRT patients had a higher risk of mortality than focal patients (p = 0.008).

The design takes advantage of an efficient transformation of testosterone leading to the synthesis of the key diene, 7α-(buta-1,3-dienyl)-4-androsten-17β-ol-3-one, through an elimination reaction. It was found that in some instances the same reaction led to partial epimerization of the 17β-hydroxyl group into the 17α-hydroxyl group. The specific orientation of the hydroxyl function was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy. Capitalizing on this unforeseen side reaction, several dimers were assembled using an olefin metathesis reaction with Hoveyda-Grubbs catalyst. This led to the formation of two isomeric testosterone dimers with 17α-OH or 17β-OH (14α and 14β) as well as an androstenedione dimer (14). The new dimers and their respective precursors were tested on androgen-dependent (LNCaP) and androgen independent (PC3 and DU145) prostate cancer cells. It was discovered that the most active dimer was made of the natural hormone testosterone (14β) with an average IC50 of 13.3 μM. In LNCaP cells, 14β was ∼5 times more active than the antiandrogen drug cyproterone acetate (IC50 of 12.0 μM vs. 59.6 μM, respectively). At low concentrations (0.25-0.5 μM), 14α and 14β were able to completely inhibit LNCaP cell growth induced by testosterone or dihydrotestosterone. Furthermore, cross-reactivity of androgen-based dimers with sterol-metabolizing cytochrome P450 3A4 was explored and the results are disclosed herein.""","""['Alexis Paquin', 'Yassine Oufqir', 'Irina F Sevrioukova', 'Carlos Reyes-Moreno', 'Gervais Bérubé']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur J Med Chem""","""['Investigating a new C2-symmetric testosterone dimer and its dihydrotestosterone analog: Synthesis, antiproliferative activity on prostate cancer cell lines and interaction with CYP3A4.', 'Synthesis of novel C2-symmetric testosterone dimers and evaluation of antiproliferative activity on androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Second-generation testosterone-platinum(II) hybrids for site-specific treatment of androgen receptor positive prostate cancer: Design, synthesis and antiproliferative activity.', 'Advances in the study of steroidal inhibitors of cytochrome P45017alpha.', 'Sex steroid hormone metabolism and prostate cancer.', 'Human cytochrome P450 3A7 binding four copies of its native substrate dehydroepiandrosterone 3-sulfate.', 'Investigating a new C2-symmetric testosterone dimer and its dihydrotestosterone analog: Synthesis, antiproliferative activity on prostate cancer cell lines and interaction with CYP3A4.', 'Substrate-selective small-molecule modulators of enzymes: Mechanisms and opportunities.', 'Unraveling the Structural Basis of Selective Inhibition of Human Cytochrome P450 3A5.', 'Structural Basis for the Diminished Ligand Binding and Catalytic Ability of Human Fetal-Specific CYP3A7.']"""

In the frame of this work, 2-arylidene derivatives were first synthesized by regioselective modification of the A-ring of natural sex hormone, 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). After Claisen-Schmidt condensations of DHT with (hetero)aromatic aldehydes in alkaline EtOH, heterocyclizations of the α,β-enones were performed with 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, 3-aminopyrazole and 3-amino-5-methylpyrazole in the presence of t-BuOK in DMF to afford 7'-epimeric mixtures of A-ring-fused azolo-dihydropyrimidines, respectively. Depending on the electronic demand of the substituents of the arylidene moiety, spontaneous or 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyanobenzoquinone (DDQ)-induced oxidation of the heteroring led to triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines and pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines in good yields, while, using the Jones reagent as a strong oxidant, 17-oxidation also occurred. The crystal structures of an arylidene and a triazolopyrimidine product have been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction and both were found to crystallize in the monoclinic crystal system at P21 space group. Most derivatives were found to diminish the transcriptional activity of androgen receptor (AR) in reporter cell line. The candidate compound (17β-hydroxy-2-(4-chloro)benzylidene-5α-androstan-3-one, 2f) showed to suppress androgen-mediated AR transactivation in a dose-dependent manner.

Bone-targeted nanoparticle-based drug carriers can overcome the difficulties in delivering therapeutic agents to metastatic bone and endowing them with a stimuli-responsive feature for controllable drug release can further maximize their therapeutic outcome. In light of hypoxic microenvironment of bone metastasis, we herein reported a bone-targeted and hypoxia-responsive polymeric micelle system for effective treatment of bone metastatic prostate cancer. The micelles were self-assembled from a polyethylene glycol and poly-l-lysine based copolymer using alendronate as a bone-targeted moiety and azobenzene as a hypoxia-responsive linker, showing a high affinity to metastatic bone and a high sensitivity in responding to hypoxia in vitro. In vivo studies further showed that after a selective accumulation in metastatic bone, the micelles could respond to hypoxic bone metastasis for rapid drug release to an effective therapeutic dosage. As a result, the micelles could suppress tumor growth in bone and inhibit bone destruction by inhibiting osteoclast activity and promoting osteoblast activity, achieving an enhanced therapeutic outcome with relieved bone pain and prolonged survival time. Bone-targeted and hypoxia-responsive nanocarriers therefore represent a promising advancement for treating bone metastasis. To our best knowledge, it might be the first example of the application of hypoxia-responsive nanocarriers in treating bone metastasis.""","""['Mengmeng Long', 'Xuemeng Liu', 'Xu Huang', 'Min Lu', 'Xiaomei Wu', 'Lingyan Weng', 'Qiuping Chen', 'Xueting Wang', 'Li Zhu', 'Zhongping Chen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Control Release""","""['Hypoxia-Responsive Stereocomplex Polymeric Micelles with Improved Drug Loading Inhibit Breast Cancer Metastasis in an Orthotopic Murine Model.', 'Alendronate-decorated biodegradable polymeric micelles for potential bone-targeted delivery of vancomycin.', 'Enzyme-responsive polymeric micelles of cabazitaxel for prostate cancer targeted therapy.', 'Functional block copolymer assemblies responsive to tumor and intracellular microenvironments for site-specific drug delivery and enhanced imaging performance.', 'Polymeric micelles in cancer therapy: State of the art.', 'Phototriggered structures: Latest advances in biomedical applications.', 'Polymeric Micellar Systems-A Special Emphasis on ""Smart"" Drug Delivery.', 'Exploring the Application of Micellar Drug Delivery Systems in Cancer Nanomedicine.', 'Multifunctional Nanoparticles Codelivering Doxorubicin and Amorphous Calcium Carbonate Preloaded with Indocyanine Green for Enhanced Chemo-Photothermal Cancer Therapy.', 'Enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of nanoparticles for cancer treatment using versatile targeted strategies.']"""

Objective:   To test for differences in CSM according to biopsy GG 5 patterns (4 + 5 vs 5 + 4 vs 5 + 5) among patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) or external beam radiation therapy (EBRT).  Design, setting, and participants:   Patients in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database treated with RP and EBRT (2004-2016) were identified and stratified according to Gleason 4 + 5 versus 5 + 4 versus 5 + 5.  Intervention:   RP or EBRT.  Outcome measurements and statistical analyses:   Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression models predicting CSM were constructed.  Results and limitations:   Of 17 263 eligible patients with GG 5 cancer at biopsy (RP: n = 7208; EBRT: n = 10 055), 12 705 had Gleason 4 + 5, 3302 had Gleason 5 + 4, and 1256 had Gleason 5 + 5 disease. Median age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at diagnosis, and advanced cT and cN stages significantly differed by Gleason pattern (Gleason 4 + 5 vs 5 + 4 vs 5 + 5; all p < 0.001). The 10-yr CSM rate was 18.2% for Gleason 4 + 5, 28.0% for Gleason 5 + 4, and 39.1% for Gleason 5 + 5 (p < 0.001). In multivariable analyses for the entire cohort adjusted for PSA, age at diagnosis, and cT and cN stage, Gleason 5 + 4 and Gleason 5 + 5 were associated with 1.6- and 2.2-fold higher CSM, respectively, relative to Gleason 4 + 5. In addition, Gleason 5 + 4 and Gleason 5 + 5 were associated with 1.6- and 2.5-fold, and 1.5- and 2.1-fold higher CSM rates in the RP and EBRT subgroups, respectively, relative to Gleason 4 + 5 (all p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   For patients with biopsy GG 5 prostate cancer treated with RP or EBRT, there are important CSM differences by Gleason pattern (4 + 5 vs 5 + 4 vs 5 + 5). Ideally, the individual Gleason pattern should be considered in pretreatment risk stratification.  Patient summary:   For patients with grade 5 prostate cancer, we found differences in cancer-specific death rates according to the pattern of abnormal cells in the prostate, called the Gleason score.

The aim of this survey was to evaluate the acceptance and use of PET-especially with prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeting tracers-in clinical routine for radiotherapy (RT) and the impact on target volume definition and dose prescription.  Methods:   We developed an online survey, which we distributed via e-mail to members of the German Society of Radiation Oncology (DEGRO). The survey included questions on patterns of care of RT for PC with/without PET. For evaluation of doses we used the equivalent dose at fractionation of 2 Gy with α/β = 1.5 Gy [EQD2(1.5 Gy)].  Results:   From 109 participants, 78.9% have the possibility to use PET for RT planning. Most centers use PSMA-targeting tracers (98.8%). In 39.5%, PSMA-PET for biochemical relapse after prior surgery is initiated at PSA ≥ 0.5 ng/mL, while 30.2% will perform PET at ≥ 0.2 ng/mL (≥ 1.0 ng/mL: 16.3%, ≥ 2.0 ng/mL: 2.3%, regardless of PSA: 11.7%). In case of PET-positive local recurrence (LR) and pelvic lymph nodes (LNs), 97.7% and 96.5% of the participants will apply an escalated dose. The median total dose in EQD2(1.5 Gy) was 70.00 Gy (range: 56.89-85.71) for LR and 62.00 Gy (range: 52.61-80.00) for LNs. A total number of ≤ 3 (22.0%) or ≤ 5 (20.2%) distant lesions was most often described as applicable for the definition as oligometastatic PC.  Conclusion:   PSMA-PET is widely used among German radiation oncologists. However, specific implications on treatment planning differ among physicians.

When this is not feasible, intra-database validation can present an appropriate alternative.  Objectives:   To illustrate through two practical examples how to perform intra-database validations of case-identifying algorithms using reconstituted Electronic Health Records (rEHRs).  Methods:   Patients with 1) multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses and 2) metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) were identified in the French nationwide healthcare database (SNDS) using two case-identifying algorithms. A validation study was then conducted to estimate diagnostic performances of these algorithms through the calculation of their positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). To that end, anonymized rEHRs were generated based on the overall information captured in the SNDS over time (e.g. procedure, hospital stays, drug dispensing, medical visits) for a random selection of patients identified as cases or non-cases according to the predefined algorithms. For each disease, an independent validation committee reviewed the rEHRs of 100 cases and 100 non-cases in order to adjudicate on the status of the selected patients (true case/ true non-case), blinded with respect to the result of the corresponding algorithm.  Results:   Algorithm for relapses identification in MS showed a 95% PPV and 100% NPV. Algorithm for mCRPC identification showed a 97% PPV and 99% NPV.

Apart from lifestyle, pollutants are also known to negatively affect the reproductive system. In addition to many other compounds that have been shown to alter androgen signaling, several environmental pollutants are known to disrupt androgen signaling via binding to androgen receptor (AR) or indirectly affecting the androgen synthesis. We analyzed here the molecular mechanism of the interaction between the human AR Ligand Binding Domain (hAR-LBD) and two environmental pollutants, linuron (a herbicide) and procymidone (a pesticide), and compared with the steroid agonist dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and well-known hAR antagonists bicalutamide and enzalutamide. Using molecular docking and dynamics simulations, we showed that the co-activator interaction site of the hAR-LBD is disrupted in different ways by different ligands. Binding free energies of the ligands were also ordered in increasing order as follows: linuron, procymidone, DHT, bicalutamide, and enzalutamide. These data were confirmed by in vitro assays. Reporter assay with MDA-kb2 cells showed that linuron, procymidone, bicalutamide and enzalutamide can inhibit androgen mediated activation of luciferase activity. Gene expression analysis further showed that these compounds can inhibit the expression of prostate specific antigen (PSA) and microseminoprotein beta (MSMB) in prostate cell line LNCaP. Comparative analysis showed that procymidone is more potent than linuron in inhibiting AR activity. Furthermore, procymidone at 10 μM dose showed equivalent and higher activity to AR inhibitor enzalutamide and bicalutamide respectively.""","""['Onur Serçinoğlu', 'Ceyhun Bereketoglu', 'Per-Erik Olsson', 'Ajay Pradhan']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Comput Biol Chem""","""['Conformational dynamics of androgen receptors bound to agonists and antagonists.', 'Cellular and molecular mechanisms of action of linuron: an antiandrogenic herbicide that produces reproductive malformations in male rats.', 'A novel cell line, MDA-kb2, that stably expresses an androgen- and glucocorticoid-responsive reporter for the detection of hormone receptor agonists and antagonists.', 'Moving Towards Precision Urologic Oncology: Targeting Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer and Mutated Forms of the Androgen Receptor Using the Novel Inhibitor Darolutamide (ODM-201).', 'Androgen receptor antagonists for prostate cancer therapy.', 'DeepAR: a novel deep learning-based hybrid framework for the interpretable prediction of androgen receptor antagonists.', 'Mechanistic Investigation of the Androgen Receptor DNA-Binding Domain and Modulation via Direct Interactions with DNA Abasic Sites: Understanding the Mechanisms Involved in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

Here, we used diagnostic leukapheresis (DLA) to enrich CTCs from patients with metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa) and explored whether organoids provide a platform for ex vivo treatment modelling.  Methods:   We prospectively screened 102 patients with mPCa and performed DLA in 40 patients with ≥5 CTCs/7.5 mL blood. We enriched CTCs from DLA using white blood cell (WBC) depletion alone or combined with EpCAM selection. The enriched CTC samples were cultured in 3D to obtain organoids and used for downstream analyses.  Results:   The DLA procedure resulted in a median yield of 5312 CTCs as compared with 22 CTCs in 7.5 mL of blood. Using WBC depletion, we recovered 46% of the CTCs, which reduced to 12% with subsequent EpCAM selection. From the isolated and enriched CTC samples, organoid expansion succeeded in 35%. Successful organoid cultures contained significantly higher CTC numbers at initiation. Moreover, we performed treatment modelling in one organoid cell line and identified substantial tumour heterogeneity in CTCs using single cell DNA sequencing.  Conclusions:   DLA is an efficient method to enrich CTCs, although the modest success rate of culturing CTCs precludes large scale clinical application. Our data do suggest that DLA and subsequent processing provides a rich source of viable tumour cells. Therefore, DLA offers a promising alternative to biopsy procedures to obtain sufficient number of tumour cells to study sequential samples in patients with mPCa.

Probenecid reportedly inhibits multiple drug-efflux transporters; hence, it can be employed as a potential sensitizer for chemotherapy. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of probenecid on three-dimensional (3D)-cultures of prostate cancer cells.  Main methods:   Prostate cancer cell lines, 22Rv1 and PC-3 were cultured as multicellular tumor spheroids. The effects of probenecid were evaluated using the MTT assay for viability, microscopy for spheroid size, and soft agar colony formation assay for anchorage-independent growth.  Key findings:   The 3D-cultured 22Rv1 cells were less sensitive to cisplatin and doxorubicin than two-dimensional (2D) cell culture. Co-administration of probenecid at a low (100 or 300 μM), but not high (500 μM), concentration increased the sensitivity to cisplatin or doxorubicin in 22Rv1 spheroids. Probenecid increased the expression of ABCG2, a multidrug resistance transporter, in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, treatment with probenecid alone reduced the growth of 22Rv1 spheroids. Conversely, probenecid inhibited spheroid compaction rather than growth inhibition in 3D-cultured PC-3 cells. Moreover, probenecid inhibited colony formation of 22Rv1 and PC-3 cells in soft agar, as well as downregulated focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a crucial factor in anchorage-independent growth.  Significance:   In 3D-cultured prostate cancer cells, probenecid demonstrated pleiotropic effects such as chemosensitization, growth suppression, inhibition of spheroid compaction, and suppression of anchorage-independent growth. Elucidating the detailed mechanism underlying these probenecid actions could result in the identification of novel therapeutic targets toward the advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Junsuke Uwada', 'Shoichiro Mukai', 'Naoki Terada', 'Hitomi Nakazawa', 'Mohammad Sayful Islam', 'Takahiro Nagai', 'Masato Fujii', 'Koji Yamasaki', 'Takanobu Taniguchi', 'Toshiyuki Kamoto', 'Takashi Yazawa']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Life Sci""","""['The resistance of intracellular mediators to doxorubicin and cisplatin are distinct in 3D and 2D endometrial cancer.', 'Rosuvastatin inhibit spheroid formation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in prostate cancer PC-3 cell line.', 'Ca2+ -activated K+ channel KCa 1.1 as a therapeutic target to overcome chemoresistance in three-dimensional sarcoma spheroid models.', 'Biological behavior of prostate cancer cells in 3D culture systems.', 'Three-Dimensional Cell Cultures as an In Vitro Tool for Prostate Cancer Modeling and Drug Discovery.', ""Let's Go 3D!

Aims:   Using Medicare claims databases, we aimed to determine rates of PSA testing in the context of screening recommendations during 1999-2015 for US men age ≥65, stratified by age group and census regions, after excluding claims relating to all prostate-related conditions.  Methods and results:   Medicare claims databases encompassed 9.71-11.12 million men for the years under study.

AR re-activation still remains a major challenge during treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) tumors that relapse after castration therapies. Recent reports have indicated the enrichment of Ser81-phosphorylated AR (pS81) in the nucleus of CRPC cells, and CDK1 and CDK9 as the kinases phosphorylating AR at S81. In the current study we showed that pS81 is preferentially localized in the nucleus in both rapid biopsy metastatic CRPC samples and PCa xenografts, and nuclear pS81 localization is correlated with AR transactivation in tumor xenografts. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis demonstrated an alignment of S81 phosphorylation and AR-mediated transactivation with the chromatin locus openness. Moreover, pS81-specific ChIP-Seq showed a disproportional occupancy of pS81 on AR-activated promoters, while 3C-ChIP assays further indicated an enrichment of pS81 at the PSA enhancer-promoter loop, a known AR activating hub. In the latter, CDK9 was shown to modulate the transactivation of the AR and RNA Pol II. Indeed, ChIP and re-ChIP assays also confirmed that AR-dependent activation of the PSA enhancer and promoter mediated by pS81 was coupled with activation of Pol II and the pTEFb complex.

Aim:   In a group of patients with a biopsy proven prostate cancer (PCa) who had undergone a multi parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) and urinary biomarker test with SelectMDx, we studied the additive value of SelectMDx to mpMRI and correlated that to the radical prostatectomy histology.  Methods and results:   Thirty-nine consecutive patients with a positive prostate biopsy were included in the study. They all had mpMRI and SelectMDx and underwent a radical prostatectomy. Overall, the mpMRI showed a PIRADS ≤3 lesion in seven cases out of the 39 patients.

The mpMRI missed significant PCa in seven cases (18%) who had a PIRADS ≤3 lesion but had a significant PCa on final histology after RP. In our study, the positive predictive values of mpMRI were 97% and that of the SelectMDx was 100%.

In prostate cancer, non-caveolar caveolin-1 (CAV1) promotes metastasis, while CAVIN1 attenuates CAV1-induced metastasis. Here, we unveil a novel mechanism linking CAV1 to selective loading of exosomes with metastasis-promoting microRNAs.  Results:   We identify hnRNPK as a CAV1-regulated microRNA binding protein. In the absence of CAVIN1, non-caveolar CAV1 drives localisation of hnRPNK to multi-vesicular bodies (MVBs), recruiting AsUGnA motif-containing miRNAs and causing their release within exosomes. This process is dependent on the lipid environment of membranes as shown by cholesterol depletion using methyl-β-cyclodextrin or by treatment with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Consistent with a role in bone metastasis, knockdown of hnRNPK in prostate cancer PC3 cells abolished the ability of PC3 extracellular vesicles (EV) to induce osteoclastogenesis, and biofluid EV hnRNPK is elevated in metastatic prostate and colorectal cancer.

In early detection, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing leads to high numbers of overtreatment. There are various reasons for the continued preference for radical surgery.  Objectives:   The goal is to examine whether the heterogeneous group with intermediate-risk PCa contains tumors that may be eligible for AS.  Materials and methods:   In the HAROW trial, 52 AS patients with differently defined intermediate-risk PCa were followed for a median of 85.6 months. Oncologic outcomes are reported.  Results:   Sixteen (30%) patients had a tumor of cT2b category, 21 (40%) had a Gleason score 3 + 4, 7 (14%) had ≥3 positive biopsy cores, 21 (40%) had a PSA >10 ng/ml, and 22 (42%) had a PSA density >0.2 ng/ml2.

We calculated the rate difference and rate ratio comparing rates in rural versus urban areas by sex and cancer type.  Results:   The incidence rate of all cancers in women was slightly lower in rural areas than in urban areas, but the total cancer rate in men was higher in rural areas than in urban areas. The incidence rates in women were higher in rural areas than in urban areas for cancers of the oesophagus, stomach, and liver and biliary passages, but lower for cancers of thyroid and breast.

TIRR mRNA expression levels negatively correlate with the expression of key p53 target genes in breast and prostate cancers. Further, TIRR loss is selectively not tolerated in p53-proficient tumors.

Institutional data of 883 consecutive patients undergoing RP were collected. Intra-operative whole-mount FS was routinely used to check for margin status and, if necessary, to resect more periprostatic tissue in order to achieve negative margins. Patients with lymph node-positive disease or final positive surgical margins were excluded from the analysis. Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses adjusting for clinical covariates were employed to examine differences in biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS) according to the resection status mentioned above.

Participants and methods:   Using a PBx simulator with real-time three-dimensional visualization, we devised a freehand, pitch-neutral (0°, horizontal plane), side-fire, transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-guided sPBx technique in the left lateral decubitus position. Thirty-four trainees on four Canadian and US urology programmes learned the technique on the same simulator, which recorded deviation from the intended template location in a double-sextant template as well as the TRUS probe pitch at the time of sampling. We defined deviation as the shortest distance in millimeters between a core centre and its intended template location, template deviation as the mean of all deviations in a template, and mastery as achieving a template deviation ≤5.0 mm.  Results:   All results are reported as mean ± sd. The mean absolute pitch and template deviation before learning the technique (baseline) were 8.2 ± 4.1° and 8.0 ± 2.7 mm, respectively, and after mastering the technique decreased to 4.5 ± 2.7° (P = 0.001) and 4.5 ± 0.6 mm (P < 0.001). Template deviation was related to mean absolute pitch (P < 0.001) and increased by 0.5 mm on average with each 1° increase in mean absolute pitch.

Patients were followed up for biochemical recurrence in the postoperative period. Results: Eighty-two of the 162 enrolled patients were in group 1 (Ep-LRP+PLND) and 80 were in group 2 (Tp-RARP+PLND). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups regarding preoperative demographics and clinical characteristics. The median LNY was 17 (range 8-27) and 17.5 (range 10-29) in groups 1 and 2, respectively, and no statistically significant difference was found. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of biochemical recurrence-free survival with mean follow-up of 44.8 months after radical surgery. Conclusion: Our results support the view that extended PLND through the Ep-LRP approach is a feasible and safe procedure without compromising oncological efficacy compared with a similar template attempted during Tp-RARP.

We hypothesize that patients diagnosed with ASCC are at increased risk for developing SPMs before or after the diagnosis of ASCC. The primary objective of this study was to identify the diagnoses of cancer most likely to occur as SPMs before or after ASCC.  Methods:   This work employs the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program registry data to conduct a US-population-based study of patients diagnosed with ASCC between 1975 and 2016. In patients diagnosed with ASCC, we evaluated the risk of SPMs and the risk of developing ASCC as an SPM after another cancer using standardized incidence ratios (SIR) for all SPMs by calculating the ratio of observed events in the ASCC cohort compared to expected (O/E) events in a matched reference cohort of the general population.  Results:   A total of 7,594 patients with primary ASCC were included. Patients with ASCC were at increased risk of the diagnosis of an SPM (SIR = 1.45), particularly cancers of the lung, vulva, oropharynx, or colon. Patients with ASCC had an increased rate of previous malignancy (SIR = 1.23), especially Kaposi sarcoma or vulvar cancer. Overall elevated incidence of SPMs was unrelated to prior radiation treatment. Radiation treatment was associated with increased risk for SPMs in the female genital system but appeared protective against prostate cancer as SPMs.  Conclusions:   Our findings support increased surveillance and screening for second malignancies in patients with these diagnoses, as patients with ASCC are often either survivors of a prior cancer diagnosis or are at increased risk of developing later malignancies.""","""['Krupa S Jani', 'Shou-En Lu', 'James D Murphy', 'Paul B Romesser', 'Krishan R Jethwa', 'Diana Li', 'Anupama Chundury', 'Abraham J Wu', 'Lara Hathout', 'Christopher L Hallemeier', 'Salma K Jabbour']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Risk of second primary malignancies following cutaneous melanoma diagnosis: a population-based study.', 'Second primary anal and oropharyngeal cancers in cervical cancer survivors.', 'The Incidence Characteristics of Second Primary Malignancy after Diagnosis of Primary Colon and Rectal Cancer: A Population Based Study.', 'Vulvar High-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions and Cancer as a Risk Factor for Anal Cancer: A Review.', 'Synchronous/Metachronous Multiple Primary Malignancies: Review of Associated Risk Factors.']"""

Deeper understanding of NEPC biology and development of novel therapeutic agents are needed. However, research is hindered by the paucity of research models, especially cell lines developed from NEPC patients. We established a novel NEPC cell line, KUCaP13, from tissue of a patient initially diagnosed with AC which later recurred as NEPC. The cell line has been maintained permanently in vitro under regular cell culture conditions and is amenable to gene engineering with lentivirus. KUCaP13 cells lack the expression of AR and overexpress NEPC-associated genes, including SOX2, EZH2, AURKA, PEG10, POU3F2, ENO2, and FOXA2. Importantly, the cell line maintains the homozygous deletion of CHD1, which was confirmed in the primary AC of the index patient. Loss of heterozygosity of TP53 and PTEN, and an allelic loss of RB1 with a transcriptomic signature compatible with Rb pathway aberration were revealed. Knockdown of PEG10 using shRNA significantly suppressed growth in vivo. Introduction of luciferase allowed serial monitoring of cells implanted orthotopically or in the renal subcapsule. Although H3K27me was reduced by EZH2 inhibition, reversion to AC was not observed.

Materials and methods:   The study group comprised 117 patients more or equal 65 years old, the control group - 333 patients <65 years old, who underwent RP with unilateral or bilateral NST from January 2012 to December 2019. The analysis of pathomorphological results, complications rate, recurrence free survival (RFS) and the restoration of erectile function (EF) in both groups was performed.  Results:   The majority of older patients belonged to intermediate and high risk groups of biochemical recurrence. Extracapsular tumor extension was significantly more often observed in the group more or equal 65 years of age: 16.2% and 6.9%, p=0.028. There were no differences between the two groups in the frequency of serious postoperative complications ( more or equal III class according to the Clavien-Dindo classification): 2.55% and 2.7%; p=0.94. The five-year RFS after RP was 95.4% in the group <65 years old and 92.1% in the group more or equal 65 years old (p=0.31). There was a moderate tendency to a slower recovery of EF in older patients: sufficient EF after 6 and 12 months was observed in 21.9% and 59.4% versus 33.3% and 73% in the group <65 years old (p=0.12). Minimal differences in EF were observed 24 months after RP with bilateral NST (84.2% and 87.9%), and more relevant differences with unilateral NST: 53.8% and 66.7% in the study and control group (p=0.033).  Conclusions:   The performance of RP with NST in elderly patients is not associated with additional oncological risks, while the restoration of EF is somewhat slowed down in comparison with a group of patients <65 years of age.

Methods:   Population-based cohort of 716,501 people aged 15-89 years diagnosed with a first primary cancer during 1985-2014 were followed up to 31 December 2015. Flexible parametric relative survival models were used to estimate the age-specific crude probability of dying from cancer and other causes by calendar year, sex and spread of disease for all solid tumours combined and cancers of the colorectum, lung, female breast, prostate and melanoma.  Results:   Estimated 10-year sex, age and spread-specific crude probabilities of cancer death generally decreased over time for most cancer types, although the magnitude of the decrease varied. For example, out of 100 fifty-year old men with localized prostate cancer, 12 would have died from their cancer if diagnosed in 1985 and 3 in 2014. Greater degree of spread was consistently associated with higher probability of dying from cancer, although outcomes for lung cancer were consistently poor. For both males and females, the probability of non-cancer deaths was higher among older patients, those diagnosed with localized cancers and where cancer survival was higher.

The primary objectives of this study are to assess the safety of sub-urothelial injection of durvalumab using patient reported outcome measures and observed local or systemic adverse events. The secondary objectives are to examine the local immunological efficacy of sub-urothelial administration of durvalumab.  Patients and methods:   The SUBDUE-1 trial will include adult patients with either high-risk NMIBC or MIBC, who are scheduled for radical cystectomy or who have refused or are unsuitable for systemic neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Three fixed total dose levels of durvalumab (25, 75, 150 mg) will be studied to identify a dose suitable to be taken forward into phase II trials. The primary endpoint is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the trial intervention in terms of the incidence and severity of adverse events and the potential establishment of dose-limiting toxicities. The secondary efficacy endpoints include rates of pT0 status at resection, lymph node status, as well as the change in distribution of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and tumour-activated macrophages between pre- and post-injection bladder biopsies. Translational studies will focus on bladder tumour molecular sub-typing, immune infiltrate characterisation, and immune checkpoint protein expression relative to efficacy end-points.  Outcome and significance:   If proven safe and effective, this novel strategy comprising sub-urothelial durvalumab injections aimed at promoting an anti-tumour immune reaction, will provide additional treatment options for reducing tumour recurrence and progression in treatment-naïve patients with high-risk NMIBC or in patients with bacille Calmette-Guérin-refractory NMIBC.

Platinum (II)-based chemotherapy has been used to treat a number of malignancies including prostate cancer. However, the potential of cisplatin for treating prostate cancer is restricted owing to its limited efficacy and toxic side effects. Combination therapies have been proposed to increase the efficacy and reduce the toxic side effects. In the present study, we investigated how isoalantolactone (IATL), a sesquiterpene lactone extracted from the medicinal plant Inula helenium L., acts synergistically with cisplatin on human prostate cancer cells. We show that IATL significantly increased cisplatin-induced growth suppression and apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells. Mechanistically, the combined treatment resulted in an excessive accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which leads to the activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the JNK signaling pathway in human prostate cancer cells. Pretreatment of cells with the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) significantly abrogated the combined treatment-induced ROS accumulation and cell apoptosis. In addition, the activation of ER stress and the JNK signaling pathway prompted by IATL and cisplatin was also reversed by NAC pretreatment. In vivo, we found that IATL combined with cisplatin showed the strongest antitumor effects compared with single agents.

However, its pathological significance in prostate cancer, one of the most frequent and lethal malignancies in men, remains unclear. In the present study, we focused on a pathological role of the VEGF receptors (VEGFRs), and examined their expression and effects of MAZ51 (an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase of VEGFR-3) on cell proliferation, migration, and tumor growth in human prostate cancer cells. The expression level of VEGFR-3 was higher in androgen-independent and highly metastatic prostate cancer PC-3 cells than in other prostate PrEC, LNCaP, and DU145 cells. In PC-3 cells, VEGFR-3 and Akt were phosphorylated following a stimulation with 50 ng/ml VEGF-C, and these phosphorylations were blocked by 3 μM MAZ51. Interestingly, PC-3 cells themselves secreted VEGF-C, which was markedly larger amount compared with PrEC, LNCaP, and DU145 cells. MAZ51 reduced the expression of VEGFR-3 but not VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. The proliferation of PC-3 cells was inhibited by MAZ51 (IC50 = 2.7 μM) and VEGFR-3 siRNA, and partly decreased by 100 nM GSK690693 (an Akt inhibitor) and 300 nM VEGFR2 Kinase Inhibitor I. MAZ51 and VEGFR-3 siRNA also attenuated the VEGF-C-induced migration of PC-3 cells. Moreover, MAZ51 blocked the tumor growth of PC-3 cells in a xenograft mouse model.

However, the potential biology role and molecular mechanism of LINC00908 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma are still unclear.  Methods:   LINC00908 and miR-671-5p expression were evaluated in DLBCL tissues and cell lines using RT-qPCR. CCK-8 and transwell assay were used to analyze the in vitro role of LINC00908 in DLBCL progression. The xenograft model was used to explore the in vivo role of LINC00908 in DLBCL growth. The physical interaction between LINC00908 and miR-671-5p was confirmed using bioinformatics analysis and a dual luciferase assay, RIP and RNA pull down.  Results:   The expression of LINC00908 was markedly up-regulated in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma tissues and cell lines, and the decreased expression of LINC00908 significantly inhibited diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell proliferation and invasion. Then, we revealed that LINC00908 directly interacted with miR-671-5p, which was down-regulated in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells and highly expressed with LINC00908 knockdown. Moreover, luciferase reporter assays and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay further proved that miR-671-5p is a direct target of LINC00908 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells. Rescue experiments were also performed, and we confirmed that LINC00908 acts as an oncogene role in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma through miR-671-5p.

Moreover, previous studies demonstrated that the extract from H. scabra contains many bioactive compounds with potent inhibitory effect on tumor cell survival and progression. However, the effect of the methanolic extract from the body wall of H. scabra (BWMT) on human prostate cancer cells has not yet been investigated. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects and underlying mechanism of BWMT on prostate cancer cell viability and metastasis. BWMT was obtained by maceration with methanol. The effect of BWMT on cell viability was assessed by MTT and colony formation assays. The intracellular ROS accumulation was evaluated using a DCFH-DA fluorescence probe. Hoechst 33342 staining and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining were used to examine the apoptotic-inducing effect of the extract. A transwell migration assay was performed to determine the anti-metastasis effect. BWMT significantly reduced cell viability and triggered cellular apoptosis by accumulating intracellular ROS resulting in the upregulation of JNK and p38 signaling pathways. In addition, BWMT also inhibited the invasion of PC3 cells by downregulating MMP-2/-9 expression via the ERK pathway. Consequently, our study provides BWMT from H. scabra as a putative therapeutic agent that could be applicable against prostate cancer progression.""","""['Kanta Pranweerapaiboon', 'Kunwadee Noonong', 'Somjai Apisawetakan', 'Prasert Sobhon', 'Kulathida Chaithirayanon']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Microbiol Biotechnol""","""['Sea cucumber extract TBL-12 inhibits the proliferation, migration, and invasion of human prostate cancer cells through the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and intrinsic caspase apoptosis pathway.', 'An ethyl-acetate fraction of Holothuria scabra modulates inflammation in vitro through inhibiting the production of nitric oxide and pro-inflammatory cytokines via NF-κB and JNK pathways.', 'Holothuria scabra Extract Induces Cell Apoptosis and Suppresses Warburg Effect by Down-Regulating Akt/mTOR/HIF-1 Axis in MDA-MB-231 Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Selective toxicity of persian gulf sea cucumber holothuria parva on human chronic lymphocytic leukemia b lymphocytes by direct mitochondrial targeting.', 'Eupatilin Inhibits the Proliferation and Migration of Prostate Cancer Cells through Modulation of PTEN and NF-κB Signaling.', 'Antioxidant and Anti-inflammatory Activity of Sea Cucumber (Holothuria scabra) Active Compounds against KEAP1 and iNOS Protein.', '2-Butoxytetrahydrofuran and Palmitic Acid from Holothuria scabra Enhance C. elegans Lifespan and Healthspan via DAF-16/FOXO and SKN-1/NRF2 Signaling Pathways.']"""

Enzalutamide is an oral second-generation anti-androgen that is active in mCRPC. Circulating tumor cells (CTC) count correlates with overall survival (OS) in mCRPC, whereas detection of the androgen-receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7) in CTC predicts poor response to oral second-generation anti-androgens. Also, loss of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) in CTC is a biomarker of poor prognosis in mCRPC.  Patients and methods:   In this translational study, we employed flow cytometry to assess total, PTEN-, and AR-V7+ CTC count per 7.5 mL of whole blood in a prospective cohort of patients with mCRPC receiving enzalutamide.  Results:   CTCs were assessed in a total of 45 men with mCRPC at baseline and at 12 weeks. Overall, CTC, PTEN- CTC, and AR-V7+ CTC detection rate was high, at baseline, with 84.4%, 71.1%, and 51.1% of samples showing at least 1 cell/7.5-mL blood, respectively, and after 3 months, with 93.3%, 64.4%, and 77.7% of samples showing at least 1 cell/7.5-mL blood, respectively. Median radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and OS were 6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.6-9) and 14.3 (95% CI, 12.8-20.3) months, respectively. Median (interquartile range) total CTC count at baseline was 5 (3; 8), whereas median (interquartile range) PTEN- CTC count was 2 (0; 4) and median (interquartile range) AR-V7+ CTC count was 1 (0; 3). At baseline, ≥ 5 versus < 5 total CTC count was associated with worse rPFS (hazard ratio [HR], 2.35; 95% CI, 1.14-4.84; P= .021) and OS (HR, 3.08; 95% CI, 1.45-6.54; P = .003), whereas ≥ 2 versus < 2 PTEN- CTC count was associated with worse rPFS (HR, 3.96; 95% CI, 1.8-8.72; P= .001) and OS (HR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.12-5; P= .025). Finally, ≥ 1 versus < 1 AR-V7+ CTC count was also associated with worse rPFS (HR, 5.05; 95% CI, 2.4-10.64; P< .001) and OS (HR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.1-4.58; P= .026).  Conclusions:   Despite multiple limitations, including the small sample size, our preliminary study suggests that assessment of CTC via flow cytometry may provide potentially useful prognostic and predictive information in advanced prostate cancer. Further studies are warranted. Micro-Abstract: In this study, men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, scheduled to start enzalutamide, were assessed for circulating tumor cell count and molecular characterization (total, PTEN-, and AR-V7+ circulating tumor cell count) by the use of flow cytometry.

Patients and methods:   This was a prospective, multicenter phase II study of radium-223 in 36 men with mCRPC and a reference cohort (n = 36) matched for fracture risk and not treated with radium-223. Bone fractures were assessed using whole-body magnetic resonance imaging. The primary outcome was risk of new fractures.  Results:   Thirty-six patients were treated with up to six 4-week cycles of radium-223. With a median follow-up of 16.3 months, 74 new fractures were identified in 20 patients. Freedom from fracture was 56% (95% confidence interval, 35.3-71.6) at 12 months. On multivariate analysis, prior corticosteroid use was associated with risk of fracture. In the reference cohort (n = 36), 16 new fractures were identified in 12 patients over a median follow-up of 24 months. Across both cohorts, 67% of all fractures occurred at uninvolved bone.

According to the American Cancer Society, there are an estimated number of 174,650 CaP new cases in 2019. The estimated number of deaths from CaP in 2019 is 31,620, making CaP the second leading cause of cancer deaths among American men with lung cancer been the first. Our goal is to estimate and map prostate cancer relative risk, with the ultimate goal of identifying counties at higher risk where interventions and further research can be targeted.  Methods:   The 2012-2016 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program data was used in this study. Analyses were conducted on 159 Georgia counties. The outcome variable is incident prostate cancer. We employed a Bayesian geospatial model to investigate both measured and unmeasured spatial risk factors for prostate cancer. We visualised the risk of prostate cancer by mapping the predicted relative risk and exceedance probabilities. We finally developed interactive web-based maps to guide optimal policy formulation and intervention strategies.  Results:   Number of persons above age 65 years and below poverty, higher median family income, number of foreign born and unemployed were risk factors independently associated with prostate cancer risk in the non-spatial model. Except for the number of foreign born, all these risk factors were also significant in the spatial model with the same direction of effects. Substantial geographical variations in prostate cancer incidence were found in the study. The predicted mean relative risk was 1.20 with a range of 0.53 to 2.92. Individuals residing in Towns, Clay, Union, Putnam, Quitman, and Greene counties were at increased risk of prostate cancer incidence while those residing in Chattahoochee were at the lowest risk of prostate cancer incidence.  Conclusion:   Our results can be used as an effective tool in the identification of counties that require targeted interventions and further research by program managers and policy makers as part of an overall strategy in reducing the prostate cancer burden in Georgia State and the United States as a whole.""","""['Justice Moses K Aheto', 'Ovie A Utuama', 'Getachew A Dagne']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Mapping under-five child malaria risk that accounts for environmental and climatic factors to aid malaria preventive and control efforts in Ghana: Bayesian geospatial and interactive web-based mapping methods.', 'Geostatistical analysis, web-based mapping, and environmental determinants of under-5 stunting: evidence from the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey.', 'Cancer incidence among predominantly black, rural-poor populations in southern states.', 'Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, 1975-2000, featuring the uses of surveillance data for cancer prevention and control.', 'Risk factors for prostate cancer.', 'Spatio-temporal variations in neonatal mortality rates in Ghana: An application of hierarchical Bayesian methods.', 'Mapping under-five child malaria risk that accounts for environmental and climatic factors to aid malaria preventive and control efforts in Ghana: Bayesian geospatial and interactive web-based mapping methods.', 'Health Burdens and SES in Alabama: Using Geographic Information System to Examine Prostate Cancer Health Disparity.']"""

However, few studies have investigated the endogenous factors that explain the multifocal disease. The primary objective of the current study is to test whether inherited PCa risk is associated with multifocal tumors in PCa patients.  Methods:   Subjects in this study were PCa patients of European ancestry undergoing active surveillance at Johns Hopkins Hospital (N = 805) and NorthShore University HealthSystem (N = 432). The inherited risk was measured by genetic risk score (GRS), an odds ratio-weighted and population-standardized polygenic risk score based on known risk-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms. PCa multifocality was indirectly measured by the number and laterality of positive tumor cores from a 12-core systematic biopsy.  Results:   In the combined cohort, 35.7% and 66.3% of patients had ≥2 tumor cores at the initial diagnostic biopsy and on at least one subsequent surveillance biopsy, respectively. For tumor laterality, 7.8% and 47.8% of patients had bilateral tumor cores at diagnostic and surveillance biopsies, respectively. We found, for the first time, that patients with higher numbers of positive cores at diagnostic and surveillance biopsies, respectively, had significantly higher mean GRS values; p = .01 and p = 5.94E-04. Additionally, patients with bilateral tumors at diagnostic and surveillance biopsies, respectively, had significantly higher mean GRS values than those with unilateral tumors; p = .04 and p = .01. In contrast, no association was found between GRS and maximum core length of tumor or tumor grade at diagnostic/surveillance biopsies (all p > .05). Finally, we observed a modest trend that patients with higher GRS quartiles had a higher risk for tumor upgrading on surveillance biopsies. The trend, however, was not statistically significant (p > .05).  Conclusions:   The associations of GRS with two measurements of PCa multifocality (core numbers and laterality) provide novel and consistent evidence for the link between inherited PCa risk and multifocal tumors.""","""['Jianfeng Xu', 'William B Isaacs', 'Mufaddal Mamawala', 'Zhuqing Shi', 'Patricia Landis', 'Jacqueline Petkewicz', 'Jun Wei', 'Chi-Hsiung Wang', 'W Kyle Resurreccion', 'Rong Na', 'Yasin Bhanji', 'Kristian Novakovic', 'Patrick C Walsh', 'S Lilly Zheng', 'Brian T Helfand', 'Christian P Pavlovich']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism-Based Genetic Risk Score and Patient Age at Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Biopsy features associated with prostate cancer progression in active surveillance patients: comparison of three statistical models.', 'Systematic Review of Active Surveillance for Clinically Localised Prostate Cancer to Develop Recommendations Regarding Inclusion of Intermediate-risk Disease, Biopsy Characteristics at Inclusion and Monitoring, and Surveillance Repeat Biopsy Strategy.', 'Germline Testing for Prostate Cancer Prognosis: Implications for Active Surveillance.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Adverse upgrading and/or upstaging in contemporary low-risk prostate cancer patients.', 'Inherited risk assessment and its clinical utility for predicting prostate cancer from diagnostic prostate biopsies.', 'Genetic Factors Associated with Prostate Cancer Conversion from Active Surveillance to Treatment.']"""

Here, we show that the loss of cell surface expression of NKA induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and promotes metastatic potential and tumor growth of prostate cancer (PCa) by decreasing the expression of E-cadherin and increasing c-Myc expression via the activation of Src/FAK pathways. Mechanistically, reduced surface expression of NKA in PCa is due to increased endocytosis through the activation of NKA/Src receptor complex. Using a high-throughput NKA ligand-screening platform, we have discovered MB5 as an inverse agonist of the NKA/Src receptor complex, capable of blocking the endocytosis of NKA. MB5 treatment increased NKA expression and E-cadherin in PCa cells, which reversed EMT and consequently decreased the invasion and growth of spheroid models and tumor xenografts. Thus, we have identified a hitherto unrecognized mechanism that regulates EMT and invasiveness of PCa and demonstrated for the first time the feasibility of identifying inverse agonists of receptor NKA/Src complex and their potential utility as anticancer drugs. We, therefore, conclude that cell surface expression of α1 NKA can be targeted for the development of new therapeutics against aggressive PCa and that MB5 may serve as a prototype for drug development against EMT in metastatic PCa.""","""['Moumita Banerjee', 'Zhichuan Li', 'Yingnyu Gao', 'Fangfang Lai', 'Minqi Huang', 'Zhongbing Zhang', 'Liquan Cai', 'Juan Sanabria', 'Tianyan Gao', 'Zijian Xie', 'Sandrine V Pierre']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['AKR1C3, a crucial androgenic enzyme in prostate cancer, promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis through activating ERK signaling.', 'The involvement of FBP1 in prostate cancer cell epithelial mesenchymal transition, invasion and metastasis by regulating the MAPK signaling pathway.', 'Inhibition of LSD1 by Pargyline inhibited process of EMT and delayed progression of prostate cancer in\xa0vivo.', 'MicroRNAs and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Na+/K+-ATPase Revisited: On Its Mechanism of Action, Role in Cancer, and Activity Modulation.', 'circSPECC1 Promotes Proliferation and Migration of LNCaP Prostate Cancer Cells by Affecting Their Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition.', ""Let's Go 3D!

In this study, we assessed the expression of key genes involved in Hh signaling in prostate cancer and investigated the potential role of smoothened (SMO) in the pathogenesis of NEPC.  Methods:   Six public datasets, each containing cases of prostate adenocarcinoma (AdPC) and NEPC, were analyzed to compare the differential messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of six classic Hh signaling genes. The SMO, synaptophysin, chromogranin A (CHGA) and androgen receptor (AR) proteins were evaluated in human tissues from 5 cases of NEPC, 2 cases of AdPC mixed with NEPC, 2 cases of AdPC with neuroendocrine differentiation and 22 cases of high-grade AdPC as determined by an immunohistochemistry assay. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to identify relevant genetic signatures associated with SMO expression based on the public datasets. Stable SMO-knockdown LNCaP and C4-2B cells were established with a lentiviral system, and the expression of SMO, Gli1, AR, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and REST was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot. Secreted PSA in the conditioned medium was assessed by ELISA. Gli1 was ectopically expressed performed by the transfection of Gli1 complementary DNA into SMO-knockdown LNCaP cells, and western blot was used to assess of AR and PSA expression.  Results:   The mRNA level of SMO was dramatically downregulated in NEPC samples compared with AdPC samples in all 6 public datasets. SMO protein loss was observed in 100% of NEPC samples but in only 9% (2 of 22) of high-grade AdPC samples. GSEA results showed that SMO loss was closely correlated with AR signaling activity. Stable SMO knockdown significantly attenuated AR signaling activity and suppressed AR expression, while Gli1 overexpression partially reversed the inhibitory effects of SMO knockdown on AR signaling activity and AR expression in LNCaP and C4-2B cells.  Conclusion:   These results demonstrate that SMO loss is a characteristic of NEPC and that detecting SMO by IHC could aid pathologists in NEPC diagnosis.

Methods:   A single-center retrospective study of mHSPC patients classified as primary mHSPC (n = 121) or secondary mHSPC (n = 106).

TP53 mutations were categorized as loss-of-function (LOF) versus dominant-negative (DN). The impacts of genetic features on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression.  Results:   Median PFS was 15 and 30 months for men with primary and secondary mHSPC, respectively (hazard ratio: 0.57, 95% confidence interval: 0.41-0.78; p < .01). OS did not show a significant difference between groups. There were more men with Gleason 8-10 disease in the primary versus secondary mHSPC groups (83% vs. 68%; p < .01). In univariate and multivariate analyses, TP53 DN mutations showed a statistically significant association with OS for the entire mHSPC population. Conversely, SPOP mutations were associated with improved OS. Additionally, TP53 mutations (DN and LOF) were associated with worse OS for secondary mHSPC. A combination of PTEN/RB1/TP53 mutations was associated with worse OS and PFS for secondary mHSPC, while no genomic alteration affected outcomes for primary mHSPC.  Conclusions:   TP53 DN mutations, but not all TP53 alterations, were the strongest predictor of negative outcomes in men with mHSPC, while SPOP mutations were associated with improved outcomes.

Its predominant subtype is non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for over 80% of the cases. Surprisingly, the majority of lung cancer‑related deaths are caused not by a primary tumour itself, but by its metastasis to distant organs. Therefore, it becomes especially important to identify the factors involved in lung cancer metastatic spread. Special AT‑rich binding protein 1 (SATB1) is a nuclear matrix protein that mediates chromatin looping and plays the role of global transcriptional regulator. During the past decade, it has received much attention as a factor promoting tumour invasion. In breast, colorectal and prostate cancers, SATB1 has been shown to influence the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, which is thought to be crucial for cancer metastasis. The aim of this study was to analyse the possible correlations between the expression of SATB1 and major EMT‑associated proteins in NSCLC clinical samples. Additionally, the impact of EMT induction in NSCLC cell lines on SATB1 mRNA expression was also investigated. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess the expression of SATB1, SNAIL, SLUG, Twist1, E‑cadherin, and N‑cadherin in 242 lung cancer clinical samples. EMT was induced by TGF‑β1 treatment in the A549 and NCI‑H1703 lung cancer cell lines. Changes in gene expression profiles were analyzed using real‑time PCR and Droplet Digital PCR. SATB1 expression was positively correlated with the expression of SNAIL (R=0.129; P=0.045), SLUG (R=0.449; P<0.0001), and Twist1 (R=0.264; P<0.0001). Moreover, SATB1 expression significantly increased after in vitro EMT induction in A549 and NCI‑H1703 cell lines. The results obtained may point to the role of SATB1 as one of the regulators of EMT in NSCLC.""","""['Natalia Glatzel-Plucinska', 'Aleksandra Piotrowska', 'Adam Rzechonek', 'Marzenna Podhorska-Okolow', 'Piotr Dziegiel']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['SATB1 Level Correlates with Ki-67 Expression and Is a Positive Prognostic Factor in Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma.', 'Sirtuin 7 promotes non‑small cell lung cancer progression by facilitating G1/S phase and epithelial‑mesenchymal transition and activating AKT and ERK1/2 signaling.', 'Loss of special AT-rich binding protein 1 expression is a marker of poor survival in lung cancer.', 'The Role of SATB1 in Tumour Progression and Metastasis.', 'The Special AT-rich Sequence Binding Protein 1 (SATB1) and its role in solid tumors.', 'HDAC5 modulates SATB1 transcriptional activity to promote lung adenocarcinoma.', 'FOXP3 Isoforms Expression in Cervical Cancer: Evidence about the Cancer-Related Properties of FOXP3Δ2Δ7 in Keratinocytes.', 'Targeting SPHK1/PBX1 Axis Induced Cell Cycle Arrest in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Identification of the molecular subtype and prognostic characteristics of pancreatic cancer based on CD8\u2009+\u2009T cell-related genes.']"""

Among the molecular targets of potential clinical interest recently highlighted by accurate preclinical studies, the TRPM8 cation channel is particularly promising. In this study, we aim at establishing a standardized immunohistochemistry protocol to evaluate TRPM8 expression in normal and pathological prostate tissues.  Methods:   The specificity and sensitivity of TRPM8 antibody ACC-049 was validated in different human prostate cell lines by western blot and immunocytochemistry analyses. Expression of the TRPM8 channel in normal and pathological prostate tissue was evaluated by immunohistochemistry using a tissue microarray containing 58 cases of prostate adenocarcinomas and in primary and lymph nodes metastatic human PCa matched specimens.  Results:   TRPM8 expression marks luminal epithelial cells in benign prostate tissue. In malignant lesions of the prostate, TRPM8 expression is frequently more abundant in advanced stages of the disease (PCa stage III/IV).

It catalyzes the hydride reduction of 5α-DHT to 3α-androstanediol, which activates androgen receptors. Elucidating details about the hydride reduction of 5α-DHT by 3α-HSD and the environment around the active site of the enzyme could lead to the development of effective drugs for the treatment of prostate cancer. In this study, the X-ray crystal structure of human 3α-HSD type 3 was comprehensively evaluated. Moreover, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and hybrid ONIOM-type quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations were performed using a large QM region (maximum 232 atoms). It was determined that the reaction proceeded in a single step without the formation of an alkoxide ion owing to the direct hydride reduction of the substrate by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and concerted proton transfer by Tyr55 and Lys84. Noncovalent interaction (NCI) analysis highlighted the roles of Tyr216 and Trp227 in 3α-HSD.

These results were compared to the results (DD, DTA and GA) measured by Delta4 Phantom + (D4P). We compared the deviations between the planned and measured values of the MLC stop positions A-side and B-side in five clinical cases of prostate VMAT during treatment and measured the GA values. For D4D, when the acceptable errors for DD, DTA, and GA were determined to be ≤3%, ≤2 mm, and ≤3%/2 mm, respectively, the minimum detectable errors in the MLC position were 2.0, 1.5, and 1.5 mm based on DD, DTA, and GA respectively. The corresponding minimum detectable MLC position errors were 2.0, 1.0, and 1.5 mm, respectively, for D4P. The deviation between the planned and measured position of MLC stopping point of prostate VMAT during treatment was stable at an average of -0.09 ± 0.05 mm, and all GA values were above 99.86%. In terms of delivering doses and dose distribution of VMAT, error detectability of D4D was comparable to that of D4P. The transmission-type detector ""D4D"" is thus suitable for detecting delivery errors during irradiation.""","""['Hirofumi Honda', 'Masahide Tominaga', 'Motoharu Sasaki', 'Masataka Oita', 'Hiromitsu Kanzaki', 'Yasushi Hamamoto', 'Yoshiaki Ishii', 'Ryuji Yamamoto', 'Teruhito Mochizuki', 'Teruhito Kido', 'Yoshihiro Uto']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Quality assurance of non-coplanar, volumetric-modulated arc therapy employing a C-arm linear accelerator, featuring continuous patient couch rotation.', 'Analysis of direct clinical consequences of MLC positional errors in volumetric-modulated arc therapy using 3D dosimetry system.', 'Texture analysis on the fluence map to evaluate the degree of modulation for volumetric modulated arc therapy.', 'Multileaf Collimator Position Accuracy of Respiratory Gated VMAT.', 'Volumetric modulated arc therapy with dynamic collimator rotation for improved multileaf collimator tracking of the prostate.']"""

Surgery remains the primary curative option for localized cancers, but good prognoses require complete removal of primary tumors and timely recognition of metastases. To expand surgical capabilities and enhance patient outcomes, we developed a six-channel color/near-infrared image sensor inspired by the mantis shrimp visual system that enabled near-infrared fluorescence image guidance during surgery. The mantis shrimp's unique eye, which maximizes the number of photons contributing to and the amount of information contained in each glimpse of its surroundings, is recapitulated in our single-chip imaging system that integrates arrays of vertically stacked silicon photodetectors and pixelated spectral filters. To provide information about tumor location unavailable from a single instrument, we tuned three color channels to permit an intuitive perspective of the surgical procedure and three near-infrared channels to permit multifunctional imaging of optical probes highlighting cancerous tissue. In nude athymic mice bearing human prostate tumors, our image sensor enabled simultaneous detection of two tumor-targeted fluorophores, distinguishing diseased from healthy tissue in an estimated 92% of cases. It also permitted extraction of near-infrared structured illumination enabling the mapping of the three-dimensional topography of tumors and surgical sites to within 1.2-mm error. In the operating room, during surgical resection in 18 patients with breast cancer, our image sensor further enabled sentinel lymph node mapping using clinically approved near-infrared fluorophores. The flexibility and performance afforded by this simple and compact architecture highlights the benefits of biologically inspired sensors in image-guided surgery.""","""['Steven Blair', 'Missael Garcia', 'Tyler Davis', 'Zhongmin Zhu', 'Zuodong Liang', 'Christian Konopka', 'Kevin Kauffman', 'Risto Colanceski', 'Imran Ferati', 'Borislav Kondov', 'Sinisa Stojanoski', 'Magdalena Bogdanovska Todorovska', 'Natasha Toleska Dimitrovska', 'Nexhat Jakupi', 'Daniela Miladinova', 'Gordana Petrusevska', 'Goran Kondov', 'Wawrzyniec Lawrence Dobrucki', 'Shuming Nie', 'Viktor Gruev']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Sci Transl Med""","""['Optical See-Through Cancer Vision Goggles Enable Direct Patient Visualization and Real-Time Fluorescence-Guided Oncologic Surgery.', 'Hands-free, wireless goggles for near-infrared fluorescence and real-time image-guided surgery.', 'Decoupling channel count from field of view and spatial resolution in single-sensor imaging systems for fluorescence image-guided surgery.', 'Advances and perspectives in near-infrared fluorescent organic probes for surgical oncology.', 'Fluorescence-guided detection of lymph node metastases of gastrointestinal tumors.', 'Bioinspired color-near infrared endoscopic imaging system for molecular guided cancer surgery.', 'Analyzing Histological Images Using Hybrid Techniques for Early Detection of Multi-Class Breast Cancer Based on Fusion Features of CNN and Handcrafted.', 'Intraoperative molecular imaging: 3rd biennial clinical trials update.', 'Updates on fluorescent probes and open-field imaging methods for fluorescence-guided cytoreductive surgery for epithelial ovarian cancer: A review.', 'Protease-activated indocyanine green nanoprobes for intraoperative NIR fluorescence imaging of primary tumors.']"""

However, analgesics are often withheld during implantation because of concerns that they may adversely affect tumor development. Previous studies examining the effects of analgesics on the development and metastasis of various tumor lines show that the effect of analgesics depends on the tumor line and analgesic used. A blanket statement that analgesics affect the general growth of tumors is not adequate scientific justification for withholding pain relief, and pilot studies or references are recommended for each specific tumor cell line and treatment combination. In this study, we evaluated the effects of 2 commonly used analgesics on tumor growth in 2 models of prostate cancer (PCa) bone metastasis. We hypothesized that a one-time injection of analgesics at the time of intratibial injection of tumor cells would not significantly impact tumor growth. Either C57BL/6 or SCID mice were injected subcutaneously with an analgesic (carprofen [5 mg/kg], or buprenorphine [0.1 mg/kg]) or vehicle (0.1 mL of saline) at the time of intratibial injection with a PCa cell line (RM1 or PC3, n = 10 to 11 per group). Tumor growth (measured by determination of tumor burden and the extent of bone involvement) and welfare (measured by nociception, locomotion, and weight) were monitored for 2 to 4 wk. Neither carprofen or buprenorphine administration consistently affected tumor growth or indices of animal welfare as compared with the saline control for either cell line. This study adds to the growing body of literature demonstrating that analgesia can be compatible with scientific objectives, and that a decision to withhold analgesics must be scientifically justified and evaluated on a model-specific basis.""","""['Jiajie J Xu', 'Sarah E Thurston', 'Tyler J Robinson', 'June F Escara-Wilke', 'Stephanie Daignault-Newton', 'Tara L Martin', 'Evan T Keller', 'Jill M Keller']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Am Assoc Lab Anim Sci""","""['Analgesics promote welfare and sustain tumour growth in orthotopic 4T1 and B16 mouse cancer models.', 'Primary tumour growth in an orthotopic osteosarcoma mouse model is not influenced by analgesic treatment with buprenorphine and meloxicam.', 'Severe combined immunodeficient-hu model of human prostate cancer metastasis to human bone.', 'Targeting cathepsin K diminishes prostate cancer establishment and growth in murine bone.', 'Palliative Treatment of Cancer-Related Pain Internet.']"""

Methods:   561 patients, treated by Radiotherapy with curative intent between 2003 and 2012, were classified according to the five risk-classes of the Candiolo nomogram and the three risk-classes of the D'Amico classification for comparison. Patients were treated with a mean prostatic dose of 77.7 Gy and a combined treatment with Androgen-Deprivation-Therapy in 76% of cases. The end-points of the study were biochemical-progression-free-survival (bPFS) and clinical-Progression-Free-Survival (cPFS). With a median follow-up of 50 months, 56 patients (10%) had a biochemical relapse, and 30 patients (5.4%) a clinical progression. The cases were divided according to D'Amico in low-risk 21%, intermediate 40%, high-risk 39%; according to Candiolo very-low-risk 24%, low 37%, intermediate 24%, high 10%, very-high-risk 5%. Statistically, the Kaplan-Meier survival curves were processed and compared using Log-Rank tests and Harrell-C concordance index.  Results:   The 5-year bPFS for the Candiolo risk-classes range between 98 and 38%, and the 5-year cPFS between 98 and 50% for very-low and very-high-risk, respectively. The Candiolo nomogram is highly significant for the stratification of both bPFS and cPFS (P < 0.0001), as well as the D'Amico classification (P = 0.004 and P = 0.001, respectively). For the Candiolo nomogram, the C indexes for bPFS and cPFS are 75 and 80%, respectively, while for D'Amico classification they are 64 and 69%, respectively. The Candiolo nomogram can identify a greater number of patients with low and very-low-risk prostate cancer (61% versus 21% according to D'Amico) and it better picks out patients with high and very-high-risk of recurrence, equal to only 15% of the total cases but subject to 48% (27/56) of biochemical relapses and 63% (19/30) of clinical progressions.  Conclusions:   the external validation of the Candiolo nomogram was overall successful with C indexes approximately 10% higher than the D'Amico control classification for bPFS and cPFS. Therefore, its clinical use is justified in prostate cancer patients before radical Radiotherapy.

Modelling of longitudinal BMI data may be more informative for incident cancer associations, e.g. using latent class trajectory modelling (LCTM) may offer advantages in capturing changes in patterns with time. Here, we evaluated the variation in cancer risk with LCTMs using specific age recall versus decade recall BMI.  Methods:   We obtained BMI profiles for participants from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. We developed gender-specific LCTMs using recall data from specific ages 20 and 50 years (72,513 M; 74,837 W); decade data from 30s to 70s (42,113 M; 47,352 W) and a combination of both (74,106 M, 76,245 W). Using an established methodological framework, we tested 1:7 classes for linear, quadratic, cubic and natural spline shapes, and modelled associations for obesity-related cancer (ORC) incidence using LCTM class membership.  Results:   Different models were selected depending on the data type used. In specific age recall trajectories, only the two heaviest classes were associated with increased risk of ORC. For the decade recall data, the shapes appeared skewed by outliers in the heavier classes but an increase in ORC risk was observed. In the combined models, at older ages the BMI values were more extreme.

Results:   Fifty-nine patients (10%) developed an SL, of which 57 underwent open retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP) and 2 underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Multivariate logistic regression revealed the following parameters as statistically significant risk factors: PSA (odds ratio [OR] = 2.23; 95% CI [1.25; 5.04], p = 0.04), number of resected lymph nodes (OR = 1.47; 95% CI [1.10; 1.97], p < 0.01), previous abdominal surgery (OR = 2.58; 95% CI [1.38; 4.91], p < 0.01), and surgical approach (OR = 0.08; 95% CI [0.01; 0.27], p < 0.01). Previous oral anticoagulation showed almost statistically significant results (OR = 2.39 [0.92; 5.51], p = 0.05).  Conclusion:   The risk for SL might be predictable considering preoperative risk factors such as PSA, previous abdominal surgery and anticoagulation.

Objectives:   To investigate the validity of Epstein criteria for clinically insignificant prostate cancer (PCa) in a cohort of the currently utilized 12-core prostate biopsy (TRUS-Bx) scheme in patients with low-risk and intermediate-risk PCa.  Method:   Pathological findings were separately evaluated in the areas matching the sextant biopsy (6-core paramedian) scheme and in all 12-core schemes. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the final pathology report of RP as true clinically significant PCa (sPCa) and insignificant PCa (insPCa) groups. Predictive factors (including Epstein criteria) and cutoff values for the presence of insPCa were separately evaluated for 6- and 12-core TRUS-Bx schemes. Then, different predictive models based on Epstein criteria with or without additional biopsy findings were created.  Results:   A total of 442 patients were evaluated. PSA density, biopsy GS, percentage of tumor and number of positive cores, PNI, and HG-PIN were independent predictive factors for insPCa in both TRUS-Bx schemes. For the 12-core scheme, the best cutoff values of tumor percentage and number of positive cores were found to be ≤50% (OR: 3.662) and 1.5 cores (OR: 2.194), respectively. The best predictive model was found to be that which added 3 additional factors (PNI and HG-PIN absence and number of positive cores) to Epstein criteria (OR: 6.041).

Sparstolonin B (SsnB), a component of the Chinese herbal medicine Sparganium stoloniferum, is used to treat many diseases. However, the effects and mechanisms of action of SsnB in prostate cancer have not yet been reported. In this study, we evaluated the effects of SsnB on cellular processes and tumour growth. In particular, we verified that SsnB could inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells and induce apoptosis by activating G2/M phase arrest in vitro based on a series of cytological experiments.

Multistate survival models provide a method of modeling the natural history of cancer. The natural history model allows for the calculation of the sojourn time. We developed a continuous-time Markov model and the corresponding likelihood function. The model allows for the use of interval-censored, left-truncated and right-censored data. The model uses data of clinically diagnosed cancers from both screened and nonscreened individuals. Parameters of age-varying hazards and age-varying misclassification are estimated simultaneously. The mean sojourn time is calculated from a micro-simulation using model parameters. The model is applied to data from a prostate screening trial.

The authors conducted a prospective study of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone to explore outcomes by race.  Methods:   This race-stratified, multicenter study estimated radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) in Black and White men with mCRPC. Secondary end points included prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics, overall survival (OS), and safety. Exploratory analysis included genome-wide genotyping to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with progression in a model incorporating genetic ancestry. One hundred patients self-identified as White (n = 50) or Black (n = 50) were enrolled. Eligibility criteria were modified to facilitate the enrollment of individual Black patients.  Results:   The median rPFS for Black and White patients was 16.6 and 16.8 months, respectively; their times to PSA progression (TTP) were 16.6 and 11.5 months, respectively; and their OS was 35.9 and 35.7 months, respectively. Estimated rates of PSA decline by ≥50% in Black and White patients were 74% and 66%, respectively; and PSA declines to <0.2 ng/mL were 26% and 10%, respectively. Rates of grade 3 and 4 hypertension, hypokalemia, and hyperglycemia were higher in Black men.  Conclusions:   Multicenter prospective studies by race are feasible in men with mCRPC but require less restrictive eligibility. Despite higher comorbidity rates, Black patients demonstrated rPFS and OS similar to those of White patients and trended toward greater TTP and PSA declines, consistent with retrospective reports. Importantly, Black men may have higher side-effect rates than White men.

Results:   In both Hi-Myc and TRAMP models, macrophages adopt a more pro-tumor phenotype in higher histological grade tumors and in older prostate tissue.

For metastatic PC, standard first-line treatment is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). While effective, ADT has many metabolic side effects. Previously, we found in serum metabolome analysis that ADT reduced androsterone sulfate, 3-hydroxybutyric acid, acyl-carnitines but increased serum glucose. Since ADT reduced ketogenesis, we speculate that low-carbohydrate diets (LCD) may reverse many ADT-induced metabolic abnormalities in animals and humans.  Methods:   In a multicenter trial of patients with PC initiating ADT randomized to no diet change (control) or LCD, we previously showed that LCD intervention led to significant weight loss, reduced fat mass, improved insulin resistance, and lipid profiles. To determine whether and how LCD affects ADT-induced metabolic changes, we analyzed serum metabolites after 3-, and 6-months of ADT on LCD versus control.  Results:   We found androsterone sulfate was most consistently reduced by ADT and was slightly further reduced in the LCD arm. Contrastingly, LCD intervention increased 3-hydroxybutyric acid and various acyl-carnitines, counteracting their reduction during ADT. LCD also reversed the ADT-reduced lactic acid, alanine, and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), elevating glycolysis metabolites and alanine. While the degree of androsterone reduction by ADT was strongly correlated with glucose and indole-3-carboxaldehyde, LCD disrupted such correlations.  Conclusions:   Together, LCD intervention significantly reversed many ADT-induced metabolic changes while slightly enhancing androgen reduction. Future research is needed to confirm these findings and determine whether LCD can mitigate ADT-linked comorbidities and possibly delaying disease progression by further lowering androgens.""","""['Jen-Tsan Chi', 'Pao-Hwa Lin', 'Vladimir Tolstikov', 'Taofik Oyekunle', 'Gloria C G Alvarado', 'Adela Ramirez-Torres', 'Emily Y Chen', 'Valerie Bussberg', 'Bo Chi', 'Bennett Greenwood', 'Rangaprasad Sarangarajan', 'Niven R Narain', 'Michael A Kiebish', 'Stephen J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Metabolomic effects of androgen deprivation therapy treatment for prostate cancer.', 'A lifestyle intervention of weight loss via a low-carbohydrate diet plus walking to reduce metabolic disturbances caused by androgen deprivation therapy among prostate cancer patients: carbohydrate and prostate study 1 (CAPS1)\xa0randomized controlled trial.', 'Serum metabolomic analysis of men on a low-carbohydrate diet for biochemically recurrent prostate cancer reveals the potential role of ketogenesis to slow tumor growth: a secondary analysis of the CAPS2 diet trial.', 'Adverse effects of androgen deprivation therapy and strategies to mitigate them.', 'Adding abiraterone to androgen deprivation therapy in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: A\xa0systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Insulin-Lowering Diets in Metastatic Cancer.', 'Personalized Medicine for Prostate Cancer: Is Targeting Metabolism a Reality?']"""

This study aimed to investigate whether clinical parameters and nomograms predict prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive lymph nodes in treatment-naïve nonmetastatic prostate cancer (PC) patients.  Materials and methods:   The clinical data of 443 PC patients (83.3% high-risk and 16.7% intermediate-risk) were retrospectively analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves with areas under the curve (AUC) were generated to evaluate the accuracy of clinical parameters (prostate-specific antigen [PSA], T stage, Gleason score [GS], International Society of Urological Pathology [ISUP] grade) and nomograms (Roach formula [RF], Yale formula [YF], and a new formula [NF]) in predicting lymph node metastasis. The AUCs of the various parameters and clinical nomograms were compared using ROC and precision-recall (PR) curves.  Results:   A total of 288 lymph node metastases were identified in 121 patients (27.3%) using 68 Ga-PSMA-11-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT). Most PSMA-avid lymph node metastases occurred in external or internal iliac lymph nodes (142; 49.3%). Clinical T stage, PSA, GS, and ISUP grade were significantly associated with PSMA-positive lymph nodes according to univariate logistic regression analysis. The PSMA-positive lymph nodes were more frequently detected in patients with PSA >20 ng/ml, GS ≥7 or high risk disease compared to their counterparts. The clinical T stage, serum PSA level, GS, and ISUP grade showed similar accuracy in predicting PSMA-positive metastasis, with AUC values ranging from 0.675 to 0.704. The median risks for PSMA-positive lymph nodes according to the RF, YF, and NF were 31.3% (range: 12.3%-100%), 22.3% (range: 4.7%-100%), and 40.5% (range: 12.3%-100%), respectively. The AUC values generated from ROC and PR curve analyses were similar for all clinical nomograms, although the RF and YF had higher accuracy compared to NF.  Conclusion:   The clinical T stage, PSA, GS, and ISUP grade are independent predictors of PSMA-positive lymph nodes. The RF and YF can be used to identify patients who can benefit from 68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT for the detection of lymph node metastasis.

The sonic hedgehog (SHH) signal regulates stem cells in normal prostate epithelium by affecting cell behavior, survival, proliferation, and maintenance. Aberrant SHH pathway activation leads to an unsuitable expansion of stem cell lineages in the prostate epithelium and the transformation of prostate CSCs (PCSCs). Zoledronic acid (ZOL), one of the third-generation bisphosphonates, effectively prevented bone metastasis and treated advanced prostate cancer despite androgen deprivation therapy. Despite strong evidence for the involvement of the SHH in human PCSCs survival and drug resistance, the roles of SHH in the PCSCs-related resistance to ZOL remain to be fully elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate the role of the SHH pathway in ZOL resistance of PCSCs in 2D and three 3D cell culture conditions. For this purpose, we isolated CD133high/ CD44high PCSCs using a flow cytometer. Following ZOL treatment, mRNA and protein expressions of the components of the SHH signaling pathway in PCSCs and non-CSCs were analyzed using qRT-PCR and Immunofluorescence staining, respectively. Our finding suggested that SHH signaling may be activated by different mechanisms that lead to avoidance of the inhibition effect of ZOL. Thereby, SHH pathways may be associated with the resistance to ZOL developed by prostate CSCs. Inhibition of CSCs-related SHH signaling along with ZOL treatment should be considered to achieve improvement in survival or delayed treatment failure and prevention of the CSCs-related drug resistance.""","""['Eda Acikgoz', 'Gunel Mukhtarova', 'Araz Alpay', 'Cigir Biray Avci', 'Bakiye Goker Bagca', 'Gulperi Oktem']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Mol Biol Rep""","""['Hedgehog overexpression leads to the formation of prostate cancer stem cells with metastatic property irrespective of androgen receptor expression in the mouse model.', 'Hypoxia induced Sonic Hedgehog signaling regulates cancer stemness, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and invasion in cholangiocarcinoma.', 'Sonic hedgehog signaling inhibition provides opportunities for targeted therapy by sulforaphane in regulating pancreatic cancer stem cell self-renewal.', 'Sonic Hedgehog Signaling in Organogenesis, Tumors, and Tumor Microenvironments.', 'Cancer Stem Cells Equipped with Powerful Hedgehog Signaling and Better Epigenetic Memory: Avenues to Look for Cancer Therapeutics.', 'Anti-Cancer Stem-Cell-Targeted Therapies in Prostate Cancer.', 'Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of circulating tumor cells and CD133 expression on predicting prognosis of thyroid cancer patients.', 'Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: Clinical Aspects and Targeted Therapies.']"""

Methods:   In this retrospective study, we identified 201 patients with newly diagnosed mHSPC between 2008 and 2014 and collected their clinical information. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to identify prognostic factors in mHSPC.  Results:   The mean age of the patients at presentation was 70 years (interquartile range (IQR), 64-76 years). The prostate-specific antigen level was 141 ng/mL (IQR, 58.8-464.5 ng/mL).

There are limited studies regarding national level environmental exposures and PC aggressiveness, which was the focus of this study METHODS: SEER was queried to identify PC cases between 2010 and 2014. The environmental quality index (EQI) is a county-level metric for 2000-2005 combining data from 18 sources and reports an overall ambient environmental quality index, as well as 5 environmental quality sub-domains (air, water, land, built, and sociodemographic) with higher values representing lower environmental quality. PC stage at diagnosis was determined and, multivariable logistic regression models which adjusted for age at diagnosis (years) and self-reported race (White, Black, Other, Unknown) were used to test associations between quintiles of EQI scores and advanced PC stage at diagnosis.  Results:   The study cohort included 252,164 PC cases, of which 92% were localized and 8% metastatic at diagnosis. In the adjusted regression models, overall environmental quality EQI (OR 1.20, CI 1.15-1.26), water EQI (OR: 1.34, CI: 1.27-1.40), land EQI (OR: 1.35, CI: 1.29-1.42) and sociodemographic EQI (OR: 1.29, CI: 1.23-1.35) were associated with metastatic PC at diagnosis. For these domains there was a dose response increase in the OR from the lowest to the highest quintiles of EQI. Black race was found to be an independent predictor of metastatic PC at diagnosis (OR: 1.36, CI: 1.30-1.42) and in stratified analysis by race; overall EQI was more strongly associated with metastatic PC in Black men (OR: 1.53, CI: 1.35-1.72) compared to White men (OR: 1.18, CI: 1.12-1.24).

However, the frequency of HR deficiency (HRD) in other solid tumor types, including bladder cancer, is less well characterized.  Experimental design:   Specific DNA aberration profiles (mutational signatures) are induced by HRD, and the presence of these ""genomic scars"" can be used to assess the presence or absence of HRD in a given tumor biopsy even in the absence of an observed alteration of an HR gene. Using whole-exome and whole-genome data, we measured various HRD-associated mutational signatures in bladder cancer.  Results:   We found that a subset of bladder tumors have evidence of HRD. In addition to a small number of tumors with biallelic BRCA1/2 events, approximately 10% of bladder tumors had significant evidence of HRD-associated mutational signatures. Increased levels of HRD signatures were associated with promoter methylation of RBBP8, which encodes CtIP, a key protein involved in HR.

However, its use as a chemoprevention/therapeutic agent is largely limited due to its low bioavailability. In this study we synthesized two variants of a new delivery system, genistein-gold nanoparticles conjugates Gen@AuNPs1 and Gen@AuNPs2, by an environmentally friendly method, using a dual role of Gen to reduce Au3+ and stabilize the formed AuNPs, with no additional component. The formation of Gen@AuNPs was confirmed via UV-Vis spectroscopy, FTIR, and Raman spectra measurements. The spherical shape and uniform size of Gen@AuNPs1 and Gen@AuNPs2 (10 ± 2 and 23 ± 3 nm, respectively), were determined by transmission electron microscopy. The nano-conjugates also varied in hydrodynamic diameter (65.0 ± 1.7 and 153.0 ± 2.2 nm) but had similar negative zeta potential (-35.0 ± 2.5 and -37.0 ± 1.6 mV), as measured by dynamic light scattering. The Gen loading was estimated to be 46 and 48%, for Gen@AuNPs1 and Gen@AuNPs2, respectively. The antiproliferative activities of GenAuNPs were confirmed by MTT test in vitro on three malignant prostate carcinoma cell lines (PC3, DU 145, and LNCaP), while selectivity toward malignant phenotype was confirmed using non-cancerous MRC-5 cells. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the inhibition on cell proliferation of more potent Gen@AuNPs1 nano-conjugate is comparable with the effects of free Gen.

Methods:   After synthesizing the compounds, cytotoxic effects of 4-MMPB and its two analogs against PC-3 cancerous and HDF normal cells were investigated by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and then mechanism of cell death was assessed by flow cytometry. Finally, the anti-tumor effects of the mentioned compounds were investigated in an immunocompromised C57BL/6 mouse model.  Results:   4-PMPB and 4-EMPB had similar anti-cancer effects on PC-3 cells as compared with 4-MMPB, while they were not effective on normal cells. Moreover, apoptosis and ferroptosis were the main mechanisms of induced cell death in these cancerous cells. Furthermore, in vivo results indicated that both analogs had similar anti-cancer effects as 4-MMPB, leading to delayed tumor growth without any noticeable side effects in weight loss and histological investigations.

Signaling pathways studies can result in the identification of targets to interrupt cancer progression. Glypicans are cell surface proteoglycans linked to the membrane through glycosylphosphatidylinositol. Their interaction with specific ligands has been reported to trigger diverse signaling, including Wnt. In this study, prostate cancer cell lines PC-3, DU-145, and LNCaP were compared to normal prostate RWPE-1 cell line to investigate glypican family members and the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway.  Results:   Glypican-1 (GPC1) was highly expressed in all the examined cell lines, except for LNCaP, which expressed glypican-5 (GPC5). The subcellular localization of GPC1 was detected on the cell surface of RWPE-1, PC-3, and DU-145 cell lines, while GPC5 suggested cytoplasm localization in LNCaP cells. Besides glypican, flow cytometry analysis in these prostate cell lines confirmed the expression of Wnt-3a and unphosphorylated β-catenin. The co-immunoprecipitation assay revealed increased levels of binding between Wnt-3a and glypicans in cancer cells, suggesting a relationship between these proteoglycans in this pathway. A marked increase in nuclear β-catenin was observed in tumor cells. However, only PC-3 cells demonstrated activation of canonical Wnt signaling, according to the TOPFLASH assay.  Conclusions:   GPC1 was the majorly expressed gene in all the studied cell lines, except for LNCaP, which expressed GPC5. We assessed by co-immunoprecipitation that these GPCs could interact with Wnt-3a. However, even though nuclear β-catenin was found increased in the prostate cancer cells (i.e., PC-3, DU-145 and LNCaP), activation of Wnt pathway was only found in PC-3 cells. In these PC-3 cells, GPC1 and Wnt-3a revealed high levels of colocalization, as assessed by confocal microscopy studies. This suggests a localization at the cellular surface, where Frizzled receptor is required for downstream activation. The interaction of Wnt-3a with GPCs in DU-145 and LNCaP cells, which occurs in absence of Wnt signaling activation, requires further studies. Once non-TCF-LEF proteins can also bind β-catenin, another signaling pathway may be involved in these cells with regulatory function.""","""['Gabrielle Ferrante Alves de Moraes', 'Eduardo Listik', 'Giselle Zenker Justo', 'Carolina Meloni Vicente', 'Leny Toma']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BMC Mol Cell Biol""","""['Glypican-5 suppresses Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition of the lung adenocarcinoma by competitively binding to Wnt3a.', 'Role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in epithelial-mesenchymal transition of human prostate cancer induced by hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha.', 'Localization of glypican-4 in different membrane microdomains is involved in the regulation of Wnt signaling.', 'Role of glypican-1 in regulating multiple cellular signaling pathways.', 'The role of glypicans in Hedgehog signaling.', 'Switching mechanism from AR to EGFR signaling via 3-O-sulfated heparan sulfate in castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

Materials and Methods: Analysis of 7268 patients who underwent RALP between 2008 and 2018 with a minimum of 12 months of follow-up was performed. The patients were then categorized into four separate neurovascular bundle-sparing groups (NVB 1-4). A Cox regression analysis was used to determine the independent factors predicting potency outcomes. Cumulative incidence functions were used to depict the probability and time to potency between the NS groups stratified by age and preoperative sexual health inventory in men (SHIM). Results: Cox regression analysis of age, preoperative SHIM score, and grades of NS significantly predicted potency outcomes post-RALP. Patients with SHIM score ≥22 had a better chance of potency vs patients with SHIM <17 (odds ratio [OR]: 1.69, confidence interval [CI]: 1.47-1.79). NVB1 had better potency vs NVB4 (OR: 3.1, CI: 2.51-3.83). Patients <55 years with NVB1 and no preoperative erectile dysfunction had the best potency rates of 92.5%. However, we did not see any statistical difference between NVB2 and NVB3 in this group, implying that in patient groups with SHIM ≥22 and age <55, NVB1 provided the best chance of potency recovery. As age increased and preoperative SHIM worsened, the curves corresponding to NVB 2 and 3 showed significant differences, suggesting that NVB 2 and 3 may be predictive in unfavorable age and preoperative SHIM groups, especially NVB 2 > NVB 3. Conclusions: Preoperative SHIM, age, and NS are the most influential factors for potency recovery following RALP. Patients with good baseline sexual function had similar postoperative potency, irrespective of their grades of partial NS. In patients with decreased baseline SHIM and older age, a higher grade of partial NS resulted in a significantly better potency compared with a lower grade of partial nerve spare.""","""['Kulthe Ramesh Seetharam Bhat', 'Marcio Covas Moschovas', 'Marco Sandri', 'Sunil Reddy', 'Fikret F Onol', 'Jonathan Noel', 'Travis Rogers', 'Oscar Schatloff', 'Rafael Coelho', 'Young Hwii Ko', 'Shannon Roof', 'Bernardo Rocco', 'Vipul R Patel']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Stratification of Potency Outcomes Following Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy Based on Age, Preoperative Potency, and Nerve Sparing.', 'Stepwise approach for nerve sparing without countertraction during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: technique and outcomes.', 'Nerve spare robot assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy with amniotic membranes: medium term outcomes.', 'Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: functional outcomes.', 'Techniques of nerve-sparing and potency outcomes following robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.', 'Simultaneous hernia repair following robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy is safe with low rates of mesh-related complications.', 'Efficacy and safety evaluation of complete intrafascial prostatectomy in suspected prostate cancer patients with dysuria: a retrospective cohort study.', 'Comparing the outcomes of robotic assisted radical prostatectomy in black and white men: Experience of a high-volume center.', 'Association of nerve-sparing grading in robotic radical prostatectomy and trifecta outcome.']"""

There is no existing commercial solution that can simultaneously track and treat multiple targets. This study experimentally implemented and evaluated a real-time multi-target tracking system for locally advanced prostate cancer.  Methods:   Real-time multi-target MLC tracking was integrated with 3D x-ray image guidance on a standard linac. Three locally advanced prostate cancer treatment plans were delivered to a static lymph node phantom and dynamic prostate phantom that reproduced three prostate trajectories. Treatments were delivered using multi-target MLC tracking, single-target MLC tracking, and no tracking. Doses were measured using Gafchromic film placed in the dynamic and static phantoms. Dosimetric error was quantified by the 2%/2 mm gamma failure rate. Geometric error was evaluated as the misalignment between target and aperture positions. The multi-target tracking system latency was measured.  Results:   The mean (range) gamma failure rates for the prostate and lymph nodes, were 18.6% (5.2%, 28.5%) and 7.5% (1.1%, 13.7%) with multi-target tracking, 7.9% (0.7%, 15.4%) and 37.8% (18.0%, 57.9%) with single-target tracking, and 38.1% (0.6%, 75.3%) and 37.2% (29%, 45.3%) without tracking. Multi-target tracking had the lowest geometric error with means and standard deviations within 0.2 ± 1.5 for the prostate and 0.0 ± 0.3 mm for the lymph nodes. The latency was 730 ± 20 ms.

While long-term urinary continence is eventually achieved in most patients who undergo radical prostatectomy (RP), predicting when patients will become continent is challenging. Prior studies aiming to predict return of post-operative continence have not evaluated patient-specific pelvic floor strength parameters.  Methods:   We reviewed a prospectively maintained database of patients undergoing RP who underwent pre-operative PFPT consultation and completed 3-month patient-reported quality of life evaluation. Trained therapists documented pelvic strength parameters. Urinary continence was defined as using 0 or 1 pad per day. We evaluated the association of PFPT parameters with urinary continence at 3 months, adjusting for other factors that could affect continence.  Results:   144 men met inclusion criteria. The majority of patients underwent nerve-sparing procedures and had intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer. At 3 months, 90 of 144 (62.5%) were continent, while 54 of 144 (37.5%) were not. On multivariable analysis, prostate volume (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.96-1.00) and pelvic floor endurance (OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.23-6.17) were significantly associated with being continent at 3 months. 56 of 76 (74%) men with good pelvic floor endurance were continent at 3 months, while only 34 of 68 (50%) men with poor endurance were continent (P = .006).

We aimed to evaluate the role of 18F-fluciclovine-PET/CT in improving cancer control compared with conventional imaging (bone scan and either CT or MRI) alone for salvage postprostatectomy radiotherapy.  Methods:   In EMPIRE-1, a single-centre, open-label, phase 2/3 randomised controlled trial, patients with prostate cancer with detectable PSA after prostatectomy and negative conventional imaging (no extrapelvic or bone findings) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to radiotherapy directed by conventional imaging alone or to conventional imaging plus 18F-fluciclovine-PET/CT. Computer-generated randomisation was stratified by PSA concentration, adverse pathology indicators, and androgen deprivation therapy intent. In the 18F-fluciclovine-PET/CT group, radiotherapy decisions were rigidly determined by PET findings, which were also used for target delineation. The primary endpoint was 3 year event-free survival, with events defined as biochemical or clinical recurrence or progression, or initiation of systemic therapy, using univariate and multivariable analyses in patients who received radiotherapy. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01666808 and is closed to new participants.  Findings:   From Sept 18, 2012, to March 4, 2019, 165 patients were randomly assigned, with median follow-up of 3·52 years (95% CI 2·98-3·95). PET findings resulted in four patients in the 18F-fluciclovine-PET/CT group having radiotherapy aborted; these patients were excluded from survival analyses. Median survival was not reached (95% CI 35·2-not reached; 33% of 81 patients had events) in the conventional imaging group compared with not reached (95% CI not reached-not reached; 20% of 76 patients) in the 18F-fluciclovine-PET/CT group, and 3 year event-free survival was 63·0% (95% CI 49·2-74·0) in the conventional imaging group versus 75·5% (95% CI 62·5-84·6) for 18F-fluciclovine-PET/CT (difference 12·5; 95% CI 4·3-20·8; p=0·0028). In adjusted analyses, study group (hazard ratio 2·04 [95% CI 1·06-3·93], p=0·0327) was significantly associated with event-free survival. Toxicity was similar in both study groups, with the most common adverse events being late urinary frequency or urgency (37 [46%] of 81 patients in the conventional imaging group and 31 [41%] of 76 in the PET group), and acute diarrhoea (11 [14%] in the conventional imaging group and 16 [21%] in the PET group).  Interpretation:   Inclusion of 18F-fluciclovine-PET into postprostatectomy radiotherapy decision making and planning significantly improved survival free from biochemical recurrence or persistence.

Methods:   Among 135 patients, 121 mCRPC patients fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included in the final analysis. Patients received a median of 3 cycles of 177Lu-PSMA-617 RLT at 6 to 12-week intervals. Primary endpoint included overall survival (OS) and secondary endpoints involved progression-free survival (PFS), predictive factors of OS and PFS, PSA response rate, molecular response, clinical response, and toxicity assessment.  Results:   The median administered cumulative activity was 20 GBq (3.7-37 GBq). The median follow-up duration was 36 months (6-72 months). The estimated median PFS and OS were 12 months (mo) (95% CI: 10.3-13 mo) and 16 mo (95% CI: 13-17 mo), respectively. Any PSA decline and PSA decline >50% was achieved in 73% and 61% of the patients, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed only failure to achieve >50% PSA decline as a significant factor associated with a poor PFS. Prognostic factors associated with reduced OS included, failure to experience >50% PSA decline, heavily pre-treated patient cohort who received >2 lines of prior treatment options, and patient sub-group treated with ≥2 lines of chemotherapy. Patients re-treated with additional treatment options after attaining 177Lu-PSMA refractory disease showed a remarkably prolonged OS. A significant clinical benefit was achieved post 177Lu-PSMA-617 RLT. The most common toxicities observed were fatigue (34.7%), followed by nausea (33%), and dry mouth (24.7%).

Purpose:   To investigate the value of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI)-based peritumoral radiomics for preoperative prediction of the presence of ECE.  Study type:   Retrospective.  Population:   Two hundred eighty-four patients with PCa from two centers (center 1: 226 patients; center 2: 58 patients). Cases from center 1 were randomly divided into training (158 patients) and internal validation (68 patients) sets. Cases from center 2 were assigned to the external validation set.  Field strength/sequence:   A 3.0 T MRI scanners (three vendors). Sequence: Pelvic T2-weighted turbo/fast spin echo sequence and diffusion weighted echo planar imaging sequence.  Assessment:   The peritumoral region (PTR) was obtained by 3-12 mm (half of the tumor length) 3D dilatation of the intratumoral region (ITR). Single-MRI radiomics signatures, mpMRI radiomics signatures, and integrated models, which combined clinical characteristics with the radiomics signatures were built. The discrimination ability was assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in the internal and external validation sets.  Statistical tests:   Fisher's exact test, Mann-Whitney U-test, DeLong test.  Results:   The PTR radiomics signatures demonstrated significantly better performance than the corresponding ITR radiomics signatures (AUC: 0.674 vs. 0.554, P < 0.05 on T2-weighted, 0.652 vs. 0.546, P < 0.05 on apparent diffusion coefficient, 0.682 vs. 0.556 on mpMRI in the external validation set). The integrated models combining the PTR radiomics signature with clinical characteristics performed better than corresponding radiomics signatures in the internal validation set (eg.

Purpose:   To construct and cross-validate a machine learning model based on radiomics features from T2 -weighted imaging (T2 WI) of PI-RADS 3 lesions to identify clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa), that is, pathological Grade Group ≥ 2.  Study type:   Single-center retrospective study.  Population:   A total of 240 patients were included (training cohort, n = 188, age range 43-82 years; test cohort, n = 52, age range 41-79 years). Eligibility criteria were 1) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-targeted biopsy between 2015 and 2020; 2) PI-RADS 3 index lesion identified on multiparametric MRI; (3) biopsy performed within 1 year of MRI. The percentages of csPCa lesions were 10.6% and 15.4% in the training and test cohorts, respectively.  Field strength/sequence:   A 3 T; T2 WI turbo-spin echo, diffusion-weighted spin-echo echo planar imaging, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI with time-resolved T1-weighted imaging.  Assessment:   Multislice volumes-of-interest (VOIs) were drawn in the PI-RADS 3 index lesions on T2 WI. A total of 107 radiomics features (first-order histogram and second-order texture) were extracted from the segmented lesions.  Statistical tests:   A random forest classifier using the radiomics features as input was trained and validated for prediction of csPCa. The performance of the machine learning classifier, prostate specific antigen (PSA) density, and prostate volume for csPCa prediction was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.  Results:   The trained random forest classifier constructed from the T2 WI radiomics features good and statistically significant area-under-the-curves (AUCs) of 0.76 (P = 0.022) for prediction of csPCa in the test set. Prostate volume and PSA density showed moderate and nonsignificant performance (AUC 0.62, P = 0.275 and 0.61, P = 0.348, respectively) for csPCa prediction in the test set.

Ultrasonography, positron emission tomography scanning, and magnetic resonance imaging were introduced, and adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy after limited surgery became routine procedures. Radioimmunoassay and immunohistochemistry techniques were standardized. The announcement in England and the United States that tobacco is a potent lung carcinogen was long delayed, important news. The US Cancer Act of 1971 made it possible to experiment with newly discovered drugs, transfer promising therapeutic agents from the laboratory to the clinic, and finance randomized clinical trials. Oncologists achieved a series of successes with combination chemotherapy in childhood cancers, adult lymphomas, and testis tumors. Clinical trials demonstrated that breast-conserving therapy is as effective as mastectomy. The discovery of retroviruses, reverse transcriptase, and vascular endothelial growth factor was coupled with learning about oncogenes. The 2-hit theory and the reciprocal translocation of chromosomes helped to solve some of the riddles of oncogenesis. The staging classification of cancers by the American Joint Committee on Cancer unified clinical and pathologic handling and prognostication of malignant tumors. The progress made in oncology between 1962 and 1977 came about through the dedicated work of many individuals.

TP53 is the tumor suppressor gene with the highest correlation with human tumorigenesis discovered so far. Besides the TP53, immune-related genes attracted much attention since the clinical application of PD-1/PD-L1 (programmed death 1/programmed cell death-ligand 1) related drugs. There is currently a lack of studies that combine TP53 with immune-related genes to analyze the prognosis of prostate cancer patients.  Methods:   Differentially expressed genes were filtered out by R package (edgeR) based on the TCGA-PRAD (The Cancer Genome Atlas-Prostate adenocarcinoma) data set. Using the R package (coxph), we distinguished which ones were related to survival prognosis. Constructing high and low risk groups, we used GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) data set to verify the prediction performance. Subsequently, we explored the functional differences in gene expression between high and low risk groups.  Results:   A total of six immune-related genes can be seen as prognostic factors in individuals with TP53 mutations. In the high-risk group, genes related to macrophage activation, epithelial cell apoptosis, and inflammation of the skin should be highly expressed. In the low-risk group, highly expressed genes are mainly involved in nucleotide phosphorylation, tRNA metabolism, and mitochondrial metabolism.  Conclusions:   Mutations in the TP53 gene can adversely affect the prognosis of prostate cancer and prostate cancer patients with mutations in some immune-related genes together have a worse prognosis. Compared with any other single clinical index, the prognostic score we proposed gave a more accurate forecast.

Methods:   We explored the G3BP1 expression in PCa using the TCGA database and verified it using clinical samples by immunohistochemistry (IHC) methods. G3BP1 and Androgen receptor (AR) status of 104 human PCa and 50 benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) samples were analyzed by IHC and the association between G3BP1 expression and biochemical recurrence was determined. Moreover, we generated G3BP1 knockdown cell lines in human PCa LNCaP cell lines, to observe AR changes.  Results:   G3BP1 and AR were overexpressed in PCa compared to BPH tissues. The expression of G3BP1 and AR was positively correlated with the malignant degree of the tumor. Higher G3BP1 expression showed a trend toward biochemical recurrence. Western blot showed downregulation of G3BP1 affected AR expression levels.  Conclusions:   Our study suggested that G3BP1 was frequently upregulated in PCa and closely related to AR expression and tumor metastasis.

The introduction of ePROs has many challenges, including funding, institutional rigidity and acceptability for both patients and clinicians. There are multiple examples of successful ePRO programmes but no specific feasibility studies in those who are less digitally engaged. Prostate cancer is predominantly a disease of older men and digital exclusion is associated with increased age. We assessed the feasibility of ePRO completion in older men receiving treatment for advanced prostate cancer both within the clinic and from home.  Materials and methods:   Men receiving palliative systemic treatment were asked to complete ePROs on a tablet computer in the outpatient department at 0 and 3 months. Participants were also offered optional completion from home. Feasibility was assessed via a mixed methods approach.  Results:   On-site ePRO completion was acceptable to most patients, with 90% finding it easy or straightforward and 80% preferring electronic over paper. Remote completion was more challenging, even for those who accessed e-mail daily and owned a tablet, with only 20% of participants successfully completing ePROs. Barriers to electronic completion can be categorised as technical, attitudinal and medical. Quality of life and symptom ePRO results were comparable with published data.

Since acidosis modulates the expression of different microRNAs (e.g., miR-7, miR-183, miR-203, miR-215), microRNAs and their targets might be mediators between tumor acidosis and malignant behavior. The aim of this study was to investigate how modulation of these microRNAs affects the expression of their targets (Crem, cAMP-responsive element modulator; Gls2, glutaminase 2; Txnip, thioredoxin-interacting protein) in experimental tumors in vivo and whether these changes are acidosis dependent. The study was performed in two experimental tumor lines of the rat (AT-1 prostate carcinoma, Walker-256 mammary carcinoma). The results showed that all three targets were regulated by acidosis in vivo, Crem and Gls2 being downregulated and Txnip upregulated in both models. In AT-1 tumors at normal tumor pH, miR-203 overexpression increased Txnip expression by about 75%, whereas in Walker-256 tumors, miR-7 reduced protein expression. In more acidic tumors, no impact of microRNAs on Txnip expression was seen. On the other hand, Gls2 was significantly increased in acidic tumors by miR-183 or miR-7 overexpression (cell line dependent). As this increase was not present under control conditions, an acidosis-dependent effect can be assumed.

Besides a distinctive oxygen deficiency, tumors often show a reduced extracellular pH (acidosis) resulting from an intensified glycolysis not only under hypoxic but also under normoxic conditions (Warburg effect). As shown in previous studies, cell migration is increased in AT1 prostate carcinoma cells after incubation at pH 6.6, and this leads to an increased number of lung metastases in vivo. However, the signaling pathway causing these functional changes is still unknown. Possible mediators could be acidosis-regulated microRNAs (miR-7, miR-183, miR-203, miR-215). The aim of the study was therefore to analyze whether a change in the expression of these microRNAs has an impact on the tumor cell migration and adhesion. Studies were performed with AT1 rat prostate cancer cells which were incubated for 24 h at pH 7.4 or 6.6. Keeping AT1 tumor cells at low pH increased the migratory capacity by about 100%. But also the decrease of miR-203 and miR-215 expression (at normal pH) led to an increase in migration velocity by 50%. In contrast, cell adhesion was increased by about 75% at low pH. However, an increase in miR-215 expression at pH 6.6 reduced the adhesion by trend. These results clearly indicated that the extracellular pH has an impact on migration and adhesion of tumor cells. In this mechanism, pH-regulated microRNAs could play a role since changes in the expression of these microRNAs (especially miR-203) are also able to modulate the migratory behavior.""","""['T Hüsing', 'L Lange', 'M Rauschner', 'Anne Riemann', 'O Thews']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Adv Exp Med Biol""","""['Impact of Acidosis-Regulated MicroRNAs on the Expression of Their Target Genes in Experimental Tumors In Vivo.', 'The Role of MicroRNA Expression for Proliferation and Apoptosis of Tumor Cells: Impact of Hypoxia-Related Acidosis.', 'Acidic extracellular environment affects miRNA expression in tumors in vitro and in vivo.', 'Role of acidosis-sensitive microRNAs in gene expression and functional parameters of tumors in vitro and in vivo.', 'Hypoxia-Related Tumor Acidosis Affects MicroRNA Expression Pattern in Prostate and Breast Tumor Cells.', 'Construction and validation of a glycolysis-related lncRNA signature for prognosis prediction in Stomach Adenocarcinoma.']"""

Intraoperative control of surgical margins (SMs) may help in ensuring the safety of the dissection. Fluorescence confocal microscopy (FCM) is an effective method for interpretation of prostate tissue and provides digital images with an appearance similar to hematoxylin-eosin staining.  Objective:   To describe an alternative technique to NeuroSAFE for intraoperative evaluation of neurovascular-adjacent margins shaved from ex vivo specimens using FCM analysis.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a prospective study of 24 patients undergoing RARP with intraoperative FCM control of margin status.  Surgical procedure:   After surgical dissection, SMs are sectioned from the fresh prostate using the Mohs technique (shaving): three slices from the apex and the right and left posterolateral aspects are obtained. Digital images of the shavings are immediately acquired via FCM and shared with a remote pathologist. In the case of a positive SM, a focal secondary resection of the bundle can be performed owing to the ability of FCM to locate a region of interest on the flat sample.  Measurements:   The primary outcome measure was the rate of negative margins at neurovascular-adjacent sites. Oncological and functional outcomes for patients with 1 yr of follow-up are also reported.  Results and limitations:   All patients had negative SMs in shavings from neurovascular-adjacent areas at final histopathology; four underwent a secondary resection with final conversion to negative SM status. Nine of ten patients with 1-yr follow-up are free of biochemical recurrence (prostate-specific antigen persistence in one pN1 case), nine are fully continent, and four of the five with preoperative potency have recovered their sexual function.  Conclusions:   Digital frozen sections with FCM during RARP may represent an alternative to NeuroSAFE for possible optimization of functional outcomes without compromising oncological safety.  Patient summary:   We developed a technique to ensure complete removal of cancer tissue during surgical removal of the prostate. Tissue specimens are examined via digital microscopy in real time during the operation. This allows the surgeon to remove more tissue if cancer is detected at the margins of a specimen, while avoiding unnecessary removal of healthy tissue.""","""['Bernardo Rocco', 'Luca Sarchi', 'Simone Assumma', 'Alessia Cimadamore', 'Rodolfo Montironi', 'Luca Reggiani Bonetti', 'Filippo Turri', 'Cosimo De Carne', 'Stefano Puliatti', 'Antonino Maiorana', 'Giovanni Pellacani', 'Salvatore Micali', 'Giampaolo Bianchi', 'Maria Chiara Sighinolfi']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""[""Reply to Eoin Dinneen, Jon Oxley, and Greg Shaw's Letter to the Editor re: Bernardo Rocco, Luca Sarchi, Simone Assumma, et al.

Strategies to alleviate the scarcity of annotated data include: using transfer learning, data augmentation and training the models with less expensive image-level annotations (weakly-supervised learning). However, it is not clear how to combine the use of transfer learning in a CNN model when different data sources are available for training or how to leverage from the combination of large amounts of weakly annotated images with a set of local region annotations. This paper aims to evaluate CNN training strategies based on transfer learning to leverage the combination of weak and strong annotations in heterogeneous data sources. The trade-off between classification performance and annotation effort is explored by evaluating a CNN that learns from strong labels (region annotations) and is later fine-tuned on a dataset with less expensive weak (image-level) labels.  Results:   As expected, the model performance on strongly annotated data steadily increases as the percentage of strong annotations that are used increases, reaching a performance comparable to pathologists ([Formula: see text]). Nevertheless, the performance sharply decreases when applied for the WSI classification scenario with [Formula: see text]. Moreover, it only provides a lower performance regardless of the number of annotations used. The model performance increases when fine-tuning the model for the task of Gleason scoring with the weak WSI labels [Formula: see text].  Conclusion:   Combining weak and strong supervision improves strong supervision in classification of Gleason patterns using tissue microarrays (TMA) and WSI regions. Our results contribute very good strategies for training CNN models combining few annotated data and heterogeneous data sources. The performance increases in the controlled TMA scenario with the number of annotations used to train the model. Nevertheless, the performance is hindered when the trained TMA model is applied directly to the more challenging WSI classification problem. This demonstrates that a good pre-trained model for prostate cancer TMA image classification may lead to the best downstream model if fine-tuned on the WSI target dataset.

The tumor-targeting efficiency of GNPs is crucial to increase the therapeutic ratio. In this study, we developed PSMA-targeted GNPs to enhance GNP uptake in prostate cancer and developed an x-ray fluorescence imaging system to noninvasively monitor and assess GNP delivery.  Methods and materials:   For targeted therapy of prostate cancer, anti-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) antibodies were conjugated onto PEGylated GNPs through 1-ethyl-3-(-3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) (EDC/NHS) chemistry. In vivo imaging was implemented using an in-house-developed dual-modality computed tomography (CT) and x-ray fluorescence CT (XFCT) system on mice bearing subcutaneous LNCaP prostate tumors. After intravenous administration of GNPs (15 mg/mL, 200 μL), the x-ray fluorescence signals from the tumor were collected at various time points (5 minutes to approximately 30 hours) for GNP pharmacokinetics analysis. At 24 hours after administration, x-ray fluorescence projection (XRFproj) and XFCT imaging were conducted to evaluate the prostate tumor uptake of active- and passive-targeting GNPs. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis was adopted as a benchmark to verify the quantification accuracy of XRFproj/XFCT imaging.  Results:   Fluorescence microscopic imaging confirmed the enhanced (approximately 4 times) targeting efficiency of PSMA-targeted GNPs in vitro. The pharmacokinetics analysis showed enhanced tumor uptake/retention of PSMA-targeted GNPs and revealed that the peak tumor accumulation appeared at approximately 24 hours after intravenous administration. Both XRFproj and XFCT imaging presented their accuracy in quantifying GNPs within tumors noninvasively. Moreover, XFCT imaging verified its unique capabilities to simultaneously determine the heterogeneous spatial distribution and the concentration of GNPs within tumors in vivo.  Conclusions:   In conjunction with PSMA-targeted GNPs, XRFproj/XFCT would be a highly sensitive tool for targeted imaging of prostate cancer, benefiting the elucidation of mechanisms of GNP-assisted prostate-cancer therapy.""","""['Daiki Hara', 'Wensi Tao', 'Tulasigeri M Totiger', 'Ali Pourmand', 'Nesrin Dogan', 'John Chetley Ford', 'Junwei Shi', 'Alan Pollack']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Quantitative imaging of gold nanoparticle distribution in a tumor-bearing mouse using benchtop x-ray fluorescence computed tomography.', 'Dual-Modality Image-Guided Surgery of Prostate Cancer with a Radiolabeled Fluorescent Anti-PSMA Monoclonal Antibody.', 'A drug-loaded aptamer-gold nanoparticle bioconjugate for combined CT imaging and therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Imaging of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Using 18FDCFPyL.', '18F-Labeled, PSMA-Targeted Radiotracers: Leveraging the Advantages of Radiofluorination for Prostate Cancer Molecular Imaging.', 'Nanomedicine for Combination Urologic Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'Novel Development of Nanoparticles-A Promising Direction for Precise Tumor Management.', 'Boosted Radiation Bystander Effect of PSMA-Targeted Gold Nanoparticles in Prostate Cancer Radiosensitization.', 'Quantifying Radiosensitization of PSMA-Targeted Gold Nanoparticles on Prostate Cancer Cells at Megavoltage Radiation Energies by Monte Carlo Simulation and Local Effect Model.', 'Targeted non AR mediated smart delivery of abiraterone to the prostate cancer.']"""

We studied the effect of serum testosterone levels on clinical outcome in localized prostate cancer (PCa) treated with ADT and high-dose radiotherapy (HRT).  Patients and methods:   The DART01/05 trial randomized 355 men with intermediate and high-risk PCa to 4 months of ADT plus HRT (STADT, N = 178) or the same treatment followed by 24 months of ADT (LTADT, N = 177). This study included patients treated with LTADT who had at least 3 determinations of testosterone during ADT (N = 154). Patients were stratified into 3 subgroups by testosterone level: minimum <20 ng/dL; median 20-49 ng/dL; and maximum ≥50 ng/dL. Kaplan-Meyer and Cox regression analysis were used for overall survival (OS) and Fine & Gray regression model for metastasis free survival (MFS), biochemical disease-free survival (bDFS) and time to TT recovery.  Results:   There were no statistically significant differences in 10-year bDFS, MFS, or OS between the <20 ng/mL and 20-49 ng/dL subgroups.

After internalization of pH-responsive ZIF-82-PVP nanoparticles, electrophilic ligands and Zn2+ are delivered into cancer cells. Electrophilic ligands can not only consume GSH under hypoxia but also capture low-energy electrons derived from X-rays to generate NO2- , which inhibits autophagy and further elevates lethal nitrosative stress levels. In addition, dissociated Zn2+ specifically limits the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells through ion interference. In vitro and in vivo results indicate that ZIF-82-PVP nanoparticles under X-ray irradiation can effectively promote the apoptosis of hypoxic prostate cancer cells.

Patients and methods:   In this prospective clinical study, we included, and risk scored patients who had a PCa-negative transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy, but elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a suspicious prostate digital rectal examination and/or a positive family history (FH) of PCa. The risk score estimated individual lifetime risk of PCa, based on a polygenic risk score (33 single nucleotide polymorphisms), age, and FH of PCa. Patients were followed, under urological supervision, for up to 4 years with annual controls, always including PSA measurements. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and/or prostate biopsy was performed at selected annual controls depending on risk score and at the urologist's/patient's discretion, which means that the follow-up differed based on the risk score.  Results:   We included 429 patients. After risk scoring, 376/429 (88%) patients were allocated to a normal-risk group (<30% PCa lifetime risk) and 53/429 (12%) to a high-risk group (≥30% PCa lifetime risk).

National guidelines for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening do not provide clear guidance for this high-risk population. The purpose of this study is to estimate the benefit and harm of intensified PSA screening in Black men.  Methods:   Two microsimulation models of prostate cancer calibrated to incidence from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program among Black men project the impact of different screening strategies (varying screening intervals, starting and stopping ages, and biopsy utilization following an abnormal PSA) on disease-specific mortality and overdiagnosis. Each strategy induces a mean lead time (MLT) for detected cases. A longer MLT reduces mortality according to estimates combining the US and European prostate cancer screening trials but increases overdiagnosis.  Results:   Under historical population screening, Black men had similar MLT to men of all races and similar mortality reduction (range between models = 21%-24% vs 20%-24%) but a higher frequency of overdiagnosis (75-86 vs 58-60 per 1000 men). Screening Black men aged 40-84 years annually would increase both mortality reduction (29%-31%) and overdiagnosis (112-129 per 1000). Restricting screening to ages 45-69 years would still achieve substantial mortality reduction (26%-29%) with lower overdiagnosis (51-61 per 1000). Increasing biopsy utilization to 100% of abnormal tests would further reduce mortality but substantially increase overdiagnosis.  Conclusions:   Annual screening in Black men is expected to reduce mortality more than that estimated under historical screening. Limiting screening to men younger than 70 years is expected to help reduce overdiagnosis.""","""['Yaw A Nyame', 'Roman Gulati', 'Eveline A M Heijnsdijk', 'Alex Tsodikov', 'Angela B Mariotto', 'John L Gore', 'Ruth Etzioni']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst""","""['The Realities of Prostate Cancer Screening, Treatment, and Race.', 'Comparative effectiveness of alternative prostate-specific antigen--based prostate cancer screening strategies: model estimates of potential benefits and harms.', 'Lead time and overdiagnosis in prostate-specific antigen screening: importance of methods and context.', 'Opportunistic testing versus organized prostate-specific antigen screening: outcome after 18 years in the Göteborg randomized population-based prostate cancer screening trial.', 'Screening for prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force.', 'Investigating the racial gap in prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen among younger men from 2012 to 2020.', 'Dépistage du cancer de la prostate chez les hommes noirs au Canada : Argument en faveur des soins stratifiés en fonction du risque.', 'Racial disparities in treatment patterns for localized prostate cancer in an equal access system: What are we missing?', 'Prostate cancer screening in Black men in Canada: a case for risk-stratified care.', 'Evaluation of Prostate Cancer Screening Strategies in a Low-Resource, High-risk Population in the Bahamas.']"""

The purpose of this work was to assess the feasibility and potential utility of HiSS MRI for the diagnosis of prostate cancer.  Methods:   HiSS MRI was acquired at 3 T from six patients who underwent prostatectomy, yielding a train of 127 phase-coherent gradient echo (GRE) images. In the temporal domain, changes in voxel intensity were analyzed and linear (R) and quadratic (R1, R2) quantifiers of signal logarithm decay were calculated. In the spectral domain, three signal scaling-independent parameters were calculated: water resonance peak width (PW), relative peak asymmetry (PRA), and relative peak distortion from ideal Lorentzian shape (PRD). Seven cancer and five normal tissue regions of interest were identified in correlation with pathology and compared.  Results:   HiSS-derived quantifiers, except R2, showed high reproducibility (coefficients of variation, 5%-14%). Spectral domain quantifiers performed better than temporal domain quantifiers, with receiver operator characteristic areas under the curve ranging from of 0.83 to 0.91. For temporal domain parameters, the range was 0.74 to 0.91. Low absolute values of the coefficients of correlation between monoexponential decay markers (R, PW) and resonance shape markers (PRA, PRD) were observed (range, 0.23-0.38).

The role of RANK expression in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is unknown.  Objective:   To assess the relevance of RANK expression in patients with MIBC.  Design, setting, and participants:   Expression of RANK was assessed via immunohistochemistry of benign urothelium, MIBC tissue, and lymph node metastases from 153 patients undergoing radical cystectomy. Expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort were analyzed for potential associations with molecular subtypes and outcome.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   RANK expression was correlated with clinical and pathological parameters and to individual data for the clinical course of MIBC.  Results and limitations:   Expression of RANK was significantly higher in both primary tumors (p = 0.02) and lymph node metastases (p = 0.01) compared to normal urothelium. In tumor tissue, RANK expression was significantly lower in patients with locally advanced disease and lymph node involvement compared to those with organ-confined disease (p = 0.0009) and node-negative MIBC (p = 0.0002). In univariable and multivariable analyses, high expression of RANK was associated with a longer time to recurrence (p = 0.0005 and 0.01) and better cancer-specific (p = 0.0004 and 0.007) and overall survival (p = 0.002 and 0.04). High expression of RANK was associated with better outcome for patients with luminal infiltrated tumors in the TCGA cohort.  Conclusions:   RANK expression is increased in bladder cancer tissue compared to benign urothelium, with higher expression in organ-defined compared to locally advanced disease. High RANK expression indicates a favorable prognosis in MIBC. The prognostic role differs in tumors of different molecular subtypes.  Patient summary:   Expression of a protein involved in bone turnover regulation (RANK) is higher in bladder cancer tissue than in benign bladder tissue. However, high levels of RANK on tumor cells indicate favorable prognosis for patients with bladder cancer that invades the muscle layer of the bladder.""","""['Moritz Maas', 'Steffen Rausch', 'Teresa Guttenberg', 'Roland Seiler', 'Jörg Hennenlotter', 'Htoo Zarni Oo', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Ursula Kühs', 'Georgios Gakis', 'Arnulf Stenzl', 'Christian Schwentner', 'Peter C Black', 'Tilman Todenhöfer']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Impact of Immune and Stromal Infiltration on Outcomes Following Bladder-Sparing Trimodality Therapy for Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer.', 'Long non-coding RNAs identify a subset of luminal muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients with favorable prognosis.', 'A reported 20-gene expression signature to predict lymph node-positive disease at radical cystectomy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer is clinically not applicable.', 'New horizons in bladder cancer research.', 'Comparison of the prognosis of primary and progressive muscle-invasive bladder cancer after radical cystectomy: A systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Materials and methods:   We recently developed, internally validated and published the Kaiser Permanente Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator. This study is a prospective validation of the calculator in a separate, referral population over a 21-month period. All patients were tested with a uniform PSA assay and a standardized systematic, ultrasound-guided biopsy scheme. We report on 3 calculator models: Model 1 included age, race, PSA, prior biopsy status, body mass index, and family history of prostate cancer; Model 2 added digital rectal exam to Model 1 variables; Model 3 added prostate volume to Model 2 variables. We considered three outcomes: high-grade disease (Gleason score ≥7), low-grade disease (Gleason score=6), and no cancer. Predictive discrimination and calibration were calculated. How each model might alter biopsy frequency and outcomes at various thresholds of risk was assessed. We compared the performance of our calculator with two other calculators.  Results:   In 4178 patients (16.2% Asian, 11.3% African American, 13.5% Hispanic), cancer was found in 53%; 62% were Gleason score ≥7. Using a high-grade risk threshold for biopsy of ≥10%, Model 2 predictions would result in 9% of men avoiding a biopsy, while only missing 2% of high-grade cancers. At the same threshold, Model 3 predictions would result in 26% of men avoiding a biopsy, while only missing 5% of high-grade cancers. The c-statistics for Models 1, 2, and 3 to predict high-grade disease vs. low-grade or no cancer were 0.76, 0.79 and 0.85, respectively. The c-statistics for Models 1, 2, and 3 to predict any prostate cancer vs. no cancer were 0.70, 0.72 and 0.80, respectively. All models were well calibrated for all outcomes. Our Model 3 calculator had superior discrimination for high grade disease (c-statistic=0.85, 0.84-0.86) and any cancer (0.80, 0.79-0.82) compared to the PBCG calculator [(0.79, 0.78-0.80); 0.72 (0.70-0.73)] and the PCPT calculator [(0.75, 0.74-0.77); 0.69 (0.67-0.70)], respectively. In the high-grade cancer predicted risk range of 0-30%, our Model 2 was better calibrated than the PCPT and PBCG calculators.

Using mixed-methods, we examined psychosocial and clinical factors associated with continued breast/prostate screening.  Methods:   We conducted an online, scenario-based, randomized study in Australia with participants aged 65+ years. The primary outcome was screening intention (10-point scale, dichotomized: low (1-5) and high (6-10)). We also measured demographic, psychosocial, and age-related clinical variables. Participants provided reason/s for their screening intentions in free-text.  Results:   271 eligible participants completed the survey (aged 65-90 years, 71% adequate health literacy). Those who reported higher cancer anxiety, were men, screened more recently, had family history of breast/prostate cancer and were independent in activities of daily living, were more likely to intend to continue screening. Commonly reported reasons for intending to continue screening were grouped into six themes: routine adherence, the value of knowing, positive screening attitudes, perceived susceptibility, benefits focus, and needing reassurance.  Conclusions:   Psychosocial factors may drive continued cancer screening in older adults and undermine efforts to promote informed decision-making.

PSMA PET/CT is superior to standard of care imaging (CT, MRI, bone scan) for detecting regional and distant metastatic PCa. PSMA PET/CT thus has the potential to guide patient selection and the planning for dRT and improve patient outcomes.  Methods:   This is a multicenter randomized phase 3 trial (NCT04457245). We will randomize 312 patients to proceed with standard dRT (control Arm, n = 150), or undergo a PSMA PET/CT scan at the study site (both 18F-DCFPyL and 68Ga-PSMA-11 can be used) prior to dRT planning (intervention arm, n = 162). dRT will be performed at the treating radiation oncologist facility. In the control arm, dRT will be performed as routinely planned. In the intervention arm, the treating radiation oncologist can incorporate PSMA PET/CT findings into the RT planning. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is administered per discretion of the treating radiation oncologist and may be modified as a result of the PSMA PET/CT results. We assume that approximately 8% of subjects randomized to the PSMA PET arm will be found to have M1 disease and thus will be more appropriate candidates for long-term systemic or multimodal therapy, rather than curative intent dRT. PET M1 patients will thus not be included in the primary endpoint analysis. The primary endpoint is the success rate of patients with unfavorable IR and HR PCa after standard dRT versus PSMA PET-based dRT. Secondary Endpoints (whole cohort) include progression free survival (PFS), metastasis-free survival after initiation of RT, overall survival (OS), % of change in initial treatment intent and Safety.  Discussion:   This is the first randomized phase 3 prospective trial designed to determine whether PSMA PET/CT molecular imaging can improve outcomes in patients with PCa who receive dRT. In this trial the incorporation of PSMA PET/CT may improve the success rate of curative intent radiotherapy in two ways: to optimize patient selection as a biomarker and to personalizes the radiotherapy plan.

Patients and methods:   The number of patients diagnosed and treated within 17 of the 18 Unicancer centers was collected in 2020 and compared with that during the same periods between 2016 and 2019. Unicancer centers treat close to 20% of cancer patients in France yearly. The reduction in the number of patients attending the Unicancer centers was analyzed per regions and cancer types. The impact of delayed care on cancer-related deaths was calculated based on different hypotheses.  Results:   A 6.8% decrease in patients managed within Unicancer in the first 7 months of 2020 versus 2019 was observed. This reduction reached 21% during April and May, and was not compensated in June and July, nor later until November 2020. This reduction was observed only for newly diagnosed patients, while the clinical activity for previously diagnosed patients increased by 4% similar to previous years. The reduction was more pronounced in women, in breast and prostate cancers, and for patients without metastasis. Using an estimated hazard ratio of 1.06 per month of delay in diagnosis and treatment of new patients, we calculated that the delays observed in the 5-month period from March to July 2020 may result in an excess mortality due to cancer of 1000-6000 patients in coming years.

We found that PGE3 played an anti-inflammatory role by inhibiting LPS and interferon-γ-induced M1 polarization and promoting interleukin-4-mediated M2 polarization (M2a). Further, we found that although PGE3 had no direct effect on the growth of prostate cancer cells in vitro, PGE3 could inhibit prostate cancer in vivo in a nude mouse model of neoplasia. Notably, we found that PGE3 significantly inhibited prostate cancer cell growth in a cancer cell-macrophage co-culture system. Experimental results showed that PGE3 inhibited the polarization of tumour-associated M2 macrophages (TAM), consequently producing indirect anti-tumour activity. Mechanistically, we identified that PGE3 regulated the expression and activation of protein kinase A, which is critical for macrophage polarization. In summary, this study indicates that PGE3 can selectively promote M2a polarization, while inhibiting M1 and TAM polarization, thus exerting an anti-inflammatory effect and anti-tumour effect in prostate cancer.""","""['Jing Cui', 'Kai Shan', 'Qin Yang', 'Yumin Qi', 'Hongyan Qu', 'Jiaqi Li', 'Rong Wang', 'Lingling Jia', 'Wei Chen', 'Ninghan Feng', 'Yong Q Chen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Cell Mol Med""","""['Resolvin D1 and D2 inhibit tumour growth and inflammation via modulating macrophage polarization.', 'Pinosylvin Shifts Macrophage Polarization to Support Resolution of Inflammation.', 'Regulation of lipid-induced macrophage polarization through modulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma activity affects hepatic lipid metabolism via a Toll-like receptor 4/NF-κB signaling pathway.', 'MiRNA-Mediated Macrophage Polarization and its Potential Role in the Regulation of Inflammatory Response.', 'Prostaglandin E3 metabolism and cancer.', 'Nanomedicines: intervention in inflammatory pathways of cancer.', 'Eicosapentaenoic and Docosahexaenoic Acid Supplementation Increases HDL Content in n-3 Fatty Acids and Improves Endothelial Function in Hypertriglyceridemic Patients.', 'Exosomal miR-200b-3p induce macrophage polarization by regulating transcriptional repressor ZEB1 in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Noncoding RNAs Controlling Oxidative Stress in Cancer.', 'HSA-miR-34a-5p regulates the SIRT1/TP53 axis in prostate cancer.']"""

Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is preferentially overexpressed in all cancers and executes its functions through interaction with numerous partner proteins. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential role of PCNA in the regulation of AR activity. An identical consensus sequence of the PCNA‑interacting protein‑box (PIP‑box) was identified at the N‑terminus of human, mouse and rat AR proteins. It was found that PCNA complexes with the full‑length AR (AR‑FL) and AR‑V7, which can be attenuated by the small molecule PIP‑box inhibitor, T2AA. PCNA also complexes with ARv567es and recombinant AR protein. The PCNA inhibitors, PCNA‑I1S and T2AA, inhibited AR transcriptional activity and the expression of AR target genes in LNCaP‑AI and 22Rv1 cells, but not in AR‑negative PC‑3 cells. The knockdown of PCNA expression reduced dihydrotestosterone‑stimulated AR transcriptional activity and abolished the inhibitory effect of PCNA‑I1S on AR activity. The PCNA inhibitor, PCNA‑I1, exerted additive growth inhibitory effects with androgen deprivation and enzalutamide in cells expressing AR‑FL or AR‑FL/AR‑V7, but not in AR‑negative PC‑3 cells. Finally, R9‑AR‑PIP, a small peptide mimicking AR PIP‑box, was found to bind to GFP‑PCNA at Kd of 2.73 µM and inhibit the expression of AR target genes, AR transcriptional activity and the growth of AR‑expressing cells. On the whole, these data strongly suggest that AR is a PCNA partner protein and interacts with PCNA via the PIP‑box and that targeting the PCNA‑AR interaction may represent an innovative and selective therapeutic strategy against prostate cancer, particularly castration‑resistant prostate cancers overexpressing constitutively active AR‑Vs.""","""['Shan Lu', 'Zhongyun Dong']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Androgen receptor splice variant 7 functions independently of the full length receptor in prostate cancer cells.', 'Preclinical studies using cisplatin/carboplatin to restore the Enzalutamide sensitivity via degrading the androgen receptor splicing variant 7 (ARv7) to further suppress Enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer.', 'PC3, but not DU145, human prostate cancer cells retain the coregulators required for tumor suppressor ability of androgen receptor.', 'Androgen receptor variant-driven prostate cancer: clinical implications and therapeutic targeting.', 'Darolutamide as a Second-Generation Androgen Receptor Inhibitor in the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Second generation androgen receptor antagonists and challenges in prostate cancer treatment.']"""

Compared with normal controls, COL6A1 and COL6A2 mRNA expression was downregulated in both NMIBC and MIBC tissue samples (P<0.05, respectively). COL6A1 and COL6A2 effectively inhibited the proliferation of human BCa EJ cells (MGH‑U1) and induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. Additionally, COL6A1 and COL6A2 served roles in MAPK and AKT signaling by increasing p38 MAPK phosphorylation and decreasing AKT phosphorylation. Finally, COL6A1 and COL6A2 inhibited wound healing and invasion by suppressing the activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)‑2 and MMP‑9.

Methods:   A total of 190 cone-beam CT (CBCT) image data sets from 16 patients with prostate cancer were used in this study. Dose reconstruction was performed on the virtual CT generated by the deformable planning CT. Then, the effects of the bladder filling, rectal filling, and the patient's body contour changes of the PCTV1 (the prostate area, B1) and PCTV2 (the seminal vesicle area, B2) on the target dose were analyzed. Correlation analysis was performed for the ratio of bladder and rectal volume variation and the variation of the bladder and rectal dose.  Results:   The mean Dice coefficients of B1, B2, bladder, and rectum were 0.979, 0.975, 0.888 and 0.827, respectively, and the mean Hausdorff distances were 0.633, 1.505, 2.075, and 1.533, respectively.

We found that BMP4-activated pSmad1-Notch-Hey1 pathway inhibits EC migration and tube formation. BMP4-activated GSK3β-βcatenin-Slug pathway stimulates Osx expression. In addition, pSmad1-regulated Dlx2 converges with the Smad1 and β-catenin pathways to stimulate osteocalcin expression.

Outcome measures included treatment preference and treatment received, knowledge, preference for shared decision making, decision making process, and patients' use and satisfaction with the DA.  Results:   Participants who received the simple DA had greater interest in shared decision making after reading the DA (p = 0.03), found the DA more helpful (p's < 0.01) and were more likely to be considering watchful waiting (p = 0.03) compared to those receiving the complex DA at Time 2.

Therefore, finding these associations between them will have a huge impact on our treatment and prevention of some diseases. However, the process of finding the associations between them is very difficult and requires a lot of time and effort. Therefore, it is particularly important to find some good methods for predicting lncRNA-disease associations (LDAs).  Results:   In this paper, we propose a method based on dual sparse collaborative matrix factorization (DSCMF) to predict LDAs. The DSCMF method is improved on the traditional collaborative matrix factorization method. To increase the sparsity, the L2,1-norm is added in our method. At the same time, Gaussian interaction profile kernel is added to our method, which increase the network similarity between lncRNA and disease. Finally, the AUC value obtained by the experiment is used to evaluate the quality of our method, and the AUC value is obtained by the ten-fold cross-validation method.  Conclusions:   The AUC value obtained by the DSCMF method is 0.8523. At the end of the paper, simulation experiment is carried out, and the experimental results of prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer and colorectal cancer are analyzed in detail.

Methods:   We relied on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to identify Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic/Latino and Asian mPCa patients treated by EBRT between 2004 and 2016. Cumulative incidence plots displayed CSM after adjustment for OCM according to race/ethnicity. Propensity score matching accounted for patient age, prostate-specific antigen, clinical T and N stages, Gleason Grade Groups and M1 substages. OCM adjusted multivariable analyses tested for differences in CSM in African-Americans, Hispanic/Latinos and Asians relative to Cauacasians.  Results:   After 3:1 propensity score matching and OCM adjustment, Asians exhibited lower CSM at 60 and 120 months (48.2 and 60.0%, respectively) compared to Caucasians (66.7 and 79.4%, respectively, p < 0.001). In OCM adjusted multivariable analyses, Asian race/ethnicity was associated with lower CSM (HR 0.66, CI 0.52-0.83, p < 0.001). Conversely, African-American and Hispanic/Latino race/ethnicity did not affect CSM. OCM rates were comparable between examined races/ethnicities.  Conclusion:   In the setting of mPCa treated with EBRT, Asians exhibit lower CSM than Caucasians, African-Americans and Hispanic/Latinos. This observation may warrant consideration in prognostic stratification schemes for newly diagnosed mPCa patients.""","""['Christoph Würnschimmel', 'Mike Wenzel', 'Claudia Collà Ruvolo', 'Luigi Nocera', 'Zhe Tian', 'Fred Saad', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Philipp Mandel', 'Felix K H Chun', 'Derya Tilki', 'Markus Graefen', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Racial/ethnic disparities in survival of metastatic prostate cancer patients treated with external beam radiotherapy.', 'Cancer-specific mortality after radical prostatectomy vs external beam radiotherapy in high-risk Hispanic/Latino prostate cancer patients.', 'The Effect of Other-cause Mortality Adjustment on Access to Alternative Treatment Modalities for Localized Prostate Cancer Among African American Patients.', 'Cancer-specific survival after radical prostatectomy versus external beam radiotherapy in high-risk and very high-risk African American prostate cancer patients.', 'Survival after radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy for locally advanced (cT3) prostate cancer.', 'Life expectancy in metastatic urothelial bladder cancer patients according to race/ethnicity.', 'Racial/ethnic disparities in the distribution and effect of type and number of high-risk criteria on mortality in prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy.', 'The effect of race/ethnicity on cancer-specific mortality after salvage radical prostatectomy.']"""

It was reported that circRNA involves in the metastasis of cancer. The aim of this study is to explore the role and mechanism of circRNA hsa_circ_0062019 in the development of prostate cancer (PCa). Our results showed that hsa_circ_0062019 was highly expressed in PCa cell lines. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay revealed that upregulation of hsa_circ_0062019 boosted PCa cell proliferation, and silencing of hsa_circ_0062019 inhibited cell proliferation. Meanwhile, transwell assay proved that upregulation of hsa_circ_0062019 facilitated PCa cell invasion and migration, while downregulation of hsa_circ_0062019 inhibited these malignant phenotypes. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assay proved the binding of hsa_circ_0062019 with miR-195-5p and the binding between miR-195-5p and high mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2), suggesting that hsa_circ_0062019 promoted the expression of HMGA2 by sponging miR-195-5p. In addition, our results revealed that the hsa_circ_0062019-induced PCa cell malignant phenotypes were notably reversed by the downregulation of HMGA2. Overall, our study demonstrated that hsa_circ_0062019 promoted PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via upregulation of HMGA2 expression by sponging miR-195-5p.

A poor understanding of cause-specific outcomes may lead to overtreatment and undertreatment.  Objective:   To examine all-cause and cancer-specific death throughout 5 years for older adults after cancer resection.  Design, setting, and participants:   This population-based cohort study was conducted in Ontario, Canada, using the administrative databases stored at ICES (formerly the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences). All adults 70 years or older who underwent resection for a new diagnosis of cancer between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2017, were included. Patients were followed up until death or censored at date of last contact of December 31, 2018.  Exposures:   Cancer resection.  Main outcome and measures:   Using a competing risks approach, the cumulative incidence of cancer and noncancer death was estimated and stratified by important prognostic factors. Multivariable subdistribution hazard models were fit to explore prognostic factors.  Results:   Of 82 037 older adults who underwent surgery (all older than 70 years; 52 119 [63.5%] female), 16 900 of 34 044 deaths (49.6%) were cancer related at a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 46 (23-80) months. At 5 years, estimated cumulative incidence of cancer death (20.7%; 95% CI, 20.4%-21.0%) exceeded noncancer death (16.5%; 95% CI, 16.2%-16.8%) among all patients. However, noncancer deaths exceeded cancer deaths starting at 3 years after surgery in breast, prostate, and melanoma skin cancers, patients older than 85 years, and those with frailty. Cancer type, advancing age, and frailty were independently associated with cause-specific death.  Conclusions and relevance:   At the population level, the relative burden of cancer deaths exceeds noncancer deaths for older adults selected for surgery. No subgroup had a higher burden of noncancer death early after surgery, even in more vulnerable patients. This cause-specific overall prognosis information should be used for patient counseling, to assess patterns of over- or undertreatment in older adults with cancer at the system level, and to guide targets for system-level improvements to refine selection criteria and perioperative care pathways for older adults with cancer.""","""['Tyler R Chesney', 'Natalie Coburn', 'Alyson L Mahar', 'Laura E Davis', 'Victoria Zuk', 'Haoyu Zhao', 'Amy T Hsu', 'Frances Wright', 'Barbara Haas', 'Julie Hallet;Recovery After Surgical Therapy for Older Adults Research–Cancer (RESTORE-Cancer) Group']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""JAMA Surg""","""['Associations of Preoperative Frailty With Cancer and Noncancer Deaths of Older Adults Following Surgery for Cancer.', 'Associations of Preoperative Frailty With Cancer and Noncancer Deaths of Older Adults Following Surgery for Cancer-Reply.', 'Patient-Centered Time-at-Home Outcomes in Older Adults After Surgical Cancer Treatment.', 'A Population-Based Study of Cardiovascular Mortality Following Early-Stage Breast Cancer.', 'Risk of Cancer-Specific Death for Patients Diagnosed With Neuroendocrine Tumors: A Population-Based Analysis.', 'Screening for Skin Cancer in Adults: An Updated Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Aspirin Use in Adults: Cancer, All-Cause Mortality, and Harms: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Low degree of patient involvement in contemporary surgical research: A scoping review.', 'The Global, Regional, and National Uterine Cancer Burden Attributable to High BMI from 1990 to 2019: A Systematic Analysis of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.', 'The role of radiotherapy in HER2+ early-stage breast cancer patients after breast-conserving surgery.', 'Adjuvant radiation therapy for older women with early-stage breast cancer: a propensity-matched SEER analysis.', 'Surgeon-reported Factors Influencing Adoption of Quality Standards for Goal-concordant Care in Patients with Advanced Cancer: A Qualitative Study.']"""

These features make diagnosis/early diagnosis difficult because of the routine protocols followed. Basal cell carcinomas have distinctive histopathological, immunohistochemical, and to some extent also different molecular characteristics. Basal cell carcinoma in situ (BCCIS) is a nonexistent histological lesion as per the current literature, but here is an attempt to describe it through this case.A 74-year-old man presented with hematuria and previous diagnosis of prostatic hyperplasia. Based on this history, he underwent a prostatectomy ad modum Freyer. Pathological examination surprisingly revealed a diffusely infiltrative tumor with nonacinar adenocarcinoma morphology and many glandular structures probably representing BCCIS. Tumor was diagnosed as BCCP. Patient presented with metastasis to the abdominal wall 8 months postprostatectomy.BCCP is an aggressive type of prostate cancer, which might be challenging to diagnose based on routine protocols. This results in delayed diagnosis and treatment and thus poor prognosis. Furthermore, patients with this subtype of prostate cancer need appropriately designed, and maybe a totally different follow-up regimen as PSA is of no use for BCCP patients. Finally, diagnosis of BCCIS, if agreed upon its existence needs to be studied in larger cohorts as a precursor lesion.""","""['Vilde Pedersen', 'Katrine S Petersen', 'Klaus Brasso', 'Olga Østrup', 'Anand C Loya']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Surg Pathol""","""['Basal cell proliferations of the prostate other than usual basal cell hyperplasia: a clinicopathologic study of 23 cases, including four carcinomas, with a proposed classification.', 'MYB-NFIB gene fusion in prostatic basal cell carcinoma: clinicopathologic correlates and comparison with basal cell adenoma and florid basal cell hyperplasia.', 'A subset of prostatic basal cell carcinomas harbor the MYB rearrangement of adenoid cystic carcinoma.', 'Adenoid cystic/basal cell carcinoma of the prostate: review and update.', 'Basal cell carcinoma of the prostate gland: a case report and brief review of the basal cell proliferations of the prostate gland.', 'Basal Cell Carcinoma of the Prostate Misdiagnosed as High-Grade Urothelial Cancer - A Case Report of a Diagnostic Pitfall.', 'Cutaneous Basal Cell Carcinoma In Situ: A Case Series.']"""

This research aimed to explore the function and molecular mechanism of circRNA X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (circ-XIAP) in docetaxel (DTX) resistance of PCa.  Methods:   The expression of circ-XIAP, microRNA-1182 (miR-1182), tumor protein D52 (TPD52) was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Exosomes were detected with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Cluster of differentiation 63 (CD63), cluster of differentiation 9 (CD9) and TPD52 protein levels were detected by Western blot (WB). FIfty percent inhibitory concentration (IC50) of DTX and cell viability were determined using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Colony formation assay was applied to assess colony-forming ability. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. Transwell assay was used for measuring cell migration and invasion. Dual-reporter luciferase assay was performed to confirm the interaction between miR-1182 and circ-XIAP or TPD52. The role of circ-XIAP in vivo was confirmed via the mice xenograft model.  Results:   Circ-XIAP and TPD52 were upregulated and miR-1182 was downregulated in DTX-resistant PCa tissue specimens and cell lines. Circ-XIAP was also overexpressed in exosomes from DTX-resistant cells and could be transmitted via exosomes. Circ-XIAP knockdown enhanced DTX sensitivity by suppressing DTX-resistant cell proliferation, migration and invasion and inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Circ-XIAP directly targeted miR-1182, and the effects of circ-XIAP knockdown were reversed by downregulating miR-1182 in DTX-resistant cells. TPD52 was the target of miR-1182, and its upregulation weakened the promotive effect of miR-1182 on DTX sensitivity. Importantly, circ-XIAP depletion inhibited tumor growth and increased DTX sensitivity in vivo.  Conclusion:   Exosomal circ-XIAP promoted DTX resistance of PCa by regulating miR-1182/TPD52 axis, providing a promising therapeutic target for PCa chemotherapy.""","""['Hui Zhang', 'Minghui Li', 'Jing Zhang', 'Yanbing Shen', 'Qi Gui']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Drug Des Devel Ther""","""['Exosomal circRNA Scm-like with four malignant brain tumor domains 2 (circ-SFMBT2) enhances the docetaxel resistance of prostate cancer via the microRNA-136-5p/tribbles homolog 1 pathway.', 'Exosomal circ_PIP5K1A regulates the progression of non-small cell lung cancer and cisplatin sensitivity by miR-101/ABCC1 axis.', 'Circ_0003998 Regulates the Progression and Docetaxel Sensitivity of DTX-Resistant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells by the miR-136-5p/CORO1C Axis.', 'Exosomal circ_0007385 enhances non-small cell lung cancer cell proliferation and stemness via regulating miR-1253/FAM83A axis.', 'Exosomal circular RNAs: A chief culprit in cancer chemotherapy resistance.', 'Recent advances of exosomal circRNAs in cancer and their potential clinical applications.', 'Mechanism of tumor-derived extracellular vesicles in prostatic cancer progression through the circFMN2/KLF2/RNF128 axis.', 'Dynamic Role of Exosome microRNAs in Cancer Cell Signaling and Their Emerging Role as Noninvasive Biomarkers.', 'Regulatory mechanisms and clinical applications of tumor-driven exosomal circRNAs in cancers.', 'The function and mechanisms of action of circular RNAs in Urologic Cancer.']"""

Given the therapeutic interest in these enzymes, we investigated expression and coregulation in hormone-sensitive (HS) and castrate-resistant (CR) prostate cancer (PC).  Methods:   EZH2 and NSD2 levels were quantified using VECTRA analysis in HS and CRPC tissue microarrays (n = 105 + 66).

PSF also promotes RNA splicing events to enhance oncogenic signals. In this study, we conducted an in vitro chemical array screen and identified multiple small molecules that interact with PSF. Several molecules inhibited RNA binding by PSF and decreased prostate cancer cell viability. Among these molecules and its derivatives was a promising molecule, No. 10-3 [7,8-dihydroxy-4-(4-methoxyphenyl)chromen-2-one], that was the most effective at blocking PSF RNA-binding ability and suppressing treatment-resistant prostate and breast cancer cell proliferation. Exposure to No. 10-3 inhibited PSF target gene expression at the mRNA level. Treatment with No. 10-3 reversed epigenetically repressed PSF downstream targets, such as cell-cycle inhibitors, at the transcriptional level. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing in prostate cancer cells revealed that No. 10-3 enhances histone acetylation to induce expression of apoptosis as well as cell-cycle inhibitors. Furthermore, No. 10-3 exhibited antitumor efficacy in a hormone therapy-resistant prostate cancer xenograft mouse model, suppressing treatment-resistant tumor growth. Taken together, this study highlights the feasibility of targeting PSF-mediated epigenetic and RNA-splicing activities for the treatment of aggressive cancers.

Once activated, the AR binds to cis-regulatory enhancer elements on DNA that drive gene expression. Yet, there are 10-100× more binding sites than differentially expressed genes. It is unclear how or if these excess binding sites impact gene transcription.  Results:   To characterize the regulatory logic of AR-mediated transcription, we generated a locus-specific map of enhancer activity by functionally testing all common clinical AR binding sites with Self-Transcribing Active Regulatory Regions sequencing (STARRseq). Only 7% of AR binding sites displayed androgen-dependent enhancer activity. Instead, the vast majority of AR binding sites were either inactive or constitutively active enhancers. These annotations strongly correlated with enhancer-associated features of both in vitro cell lines and clinical prostate cancer samples. Evaluating the effect of each enhancer class on transcription, we found that AR-regulated enhancers frequently interact with promoters and form central chromosomal loops that are required for transcription. Somatic mutations of these critical AR-regulated enhancers often impact enhancer activity.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided radiotherapy has multiple potential advantages over standard computed tomography (CT)-guided radiotherapy, including enhanced prostate visualization (abrogating the need for fiducials and MRI fusion), enhanced identification of the urethra, the ability to track the prostate in real-time, and the capacity to perform online adaptive planning. However, it is unknown whether these potential advantages translate into improved outcomes. This phase III randomized superiority trial is designed to prospectively evaluate whether toxicity is lower after MRI-guided versus CT-guided SBRT.  Methods:   Three hundred men with localized PCa will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to SBRT using CT or MRI guidance. Randomization will be stratified by baseline International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) (≤15 or > 15) and prostate gland volume (≤50 cc or > 50 cc). Five fractions of 8 Gy will be delivered to the prostate over the course of fourteen days, with or without hormonal therapy and elective nodal radiotherapy (to a dose of 5 Gy per fraction) as per the investigator's discretion. The primary endpoint is the incidence of physician-reported acute grade ≥ 2 genitourinary (GU) toxicity (during the first 90 days after SBRT), as assessed by the CTCAE version 4.03 scale. Secondary clinical endpoints include incidence of acute grade ≥ 2 gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity, 5-year cumulative incidences of physician-reported late grade ≥ 2 GU and GI toxicity, temporal changes in patient-reported quality of life (QOL) outcomes, 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival and the proportion of fractions of MRI-guided SBRT in which online adaptive radiotherapy is used.  Discussion:   The MIRAGE trial is the first randomized trial comparing MRI-guided with standard CT-guided SBRT for localized PCa. The primary hypothesis is that MRI-guided SBRT will lead to an improvement in the cumulative incidence of acute grade ≥ 2 GU toxicity when compared to CT-guided SBRT. The pragmatic superiority design focused on an acute toxicity endpoint will allow an early comparison of the two technologies.  Trial registration:   Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT04384770.

This study analyzed the expression status of LINC00649 in GC tissues and cells by performing Real-Time qPCR analysis, and we found that LINC00649 tended to be enriched in cancerous tissues and cells but not in their normal counterparts, which were supported by the data from TCGA dataset. Next, by performing the gain- and loss-of-function experiments, we expectedly found that LINC00649 acted as an oncogene to accelerate GC cell proliferation, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and promote its tumorigenesis in vivo. Moreover, the online miRDB software predicted that miR-16-5p bound to both LINC00649 and 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of YAP1 mRNA, which were validated by the following dual-luciferase reporter gene system assay and RNA pull-down assay. Finally, we proved that LINC00649 exerted its tumor-promoting effects in GC by regulating the miR-16-5p/YES-associated protein 1 (YAP1)/Hippo pathway. Mechanistically, knock-down of LINC00649 suppressed YAP1 expressions by releasing miR-16-5p, resulting in the recovery of the Hippo pathway, which suppressed the expression levels of the downstream oncogenes, including EGFR, SOX2 and OCT4, leading to the inhibition of the malignant phenotypes in GC cells.

Here we investigate the factors influencing the changing use of moderate hypofractionation (HypoRT) for the treatment of PCa.  Methods and materials:   We conducted a population-based, retrospective, consecutive cohort study using the 2014 to 2018 Outpatient Radiation Oncology Data from public and private treatment facilities in New South Wales, Australia. Included participants had a PCa diagnosis of any risk, and they completed curative-intent external beam radiation therapy without treatment to lymph nodes. Factors potentially affecting use of HypoRT were examined using a 3-level hierarchical logistic regression model. The effects were reported using adjusted, median, or interval odds ratios.  Results:   The study included 4915 patients. Of these, 4053 patients (82.5%) received conventional fractionation, and 862 patients (17.5%) received HypoRT. HypoRT utilization increased from 5.2% in 2014 to 40.3% in 2018. The treating radiation oncologist, treatment facility, and increasing distance to treatment centers had the greatest influence on HypoRT uptake. The main limitation was the lack of stratification by PCa risk categorization.

Methods:   We conducted a retrospective, difference-in-differences study including minority patients with nonmetastatic breast, colon, non-small-cell lung, and prostate cancer and patients treated at MSHs between the age of 40 and 64, with tumors at stages eligible for definitive treatment from the National Cancer Database. We not only defined non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic cancer patients as racial and ethnic minorities but also report findings for non-Hispanic Black cancer patients separately. We examined the effect of Medicaid expansion on receipt of stage-appropriate definitive therapy, time to treatment initiation (TTI) within 30 days of diagnosis, and TTI within 90 days of diagnosis.  Results:   Receipt of definitive treatment for minorities in expansion states did not change compared with minority patients in nonexpansion states. The proportion of racial and ethnic minorities in expansion states receiving treatment within 30 days increased (difference-in-differences: +3.62%; 95% CI, 1.63 to 5.61; P < .001) compared with minority patients in nonexpansion states; there was no change for TTI within 90 days. Analysis focused on Black cancer patients yielded similar results. In analyses stratified by MSH status, there was no change in receipt of definitive therapy, TTI within 30 days, and TTI within 90 days when comparing MSHs in expansion states with MSHs in nonexpansion states.  Conclusion:   In our cohort of cancer patients with treatment-eligible disease, we found no significant association between Medicaid expansion and changes in receipt of definitive treatment for breast, prostate, lung, and colon cancer for racial and ethnic minorities and at MSHs. Medicaid expansion was associated with improved TTI at the patient level for racial and ethnic minorities, but not at the facility level for MSHs. Targeted interventions addressing the needs of MSHs are still needed to continue mitigating national facility-level disparities in cancer outcomes.""","""['David-Dan Nguyen', 'Marco Paciotti', 'Maya Marchese', 'Alexander P Cole', 'Eugene B Cone', 'Adam S Kibel', 'Gezzer Ortega', 'Stuart R Lipsitz', 'Joel S Weissman', 'Quoc-Dien Trinh']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""JCO Oncol Pract""","""['Association of Care at Minority-Serving vs Non-Minority-Serving Hospitals With Use of Palliative Care Among Racial/Ethnic Minorities With Metastatic Cancer in the United States.', 'Association of Medicaid Expansion Under the Affordable Care Act With Stage at Diagnosis and Time to Treatment Initiation for Patients With Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Association of Medicaid Expansion Under the Affordable Care Act With Insurance Status, Cancer Stage, and Timely Treatment Among Patients With Breast, Colon, and Lung Cancer.', 'Racial and ethnic disparities in the receipt of cancer treatment.', 'Decision-making support among racial and ethnic minorities diagnosed with breast or prostate cancer: A systematic review of the literature.', 'Disparities in Lung Cancer: A Targeted Literature\xa0Review Examining Lung Cancer Screening, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Survival Outcomes in the United States.', 'Health Disparities: Interventions for Pulmonary Disease - A Narrative Review.', 'Survival in Young Adults With Cancer Is Associated With Medicaid Expansion Through the Affordable Care Act.', 'Impact of race-specific screening guideline on the uptake of colorectal cancer screening among young African Americans.']"""

Methods:   With 13 years of follow-up, the authors prospectively evaluated the association between aspirin and ibuprofen use and incident distal adenoma (1221 cases), recurrent adenoma (862 cases), and incident colorectal cancer (CRC; 2826 cases) among men and women in the population-based Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial.

Studies have identified 11-ketotestosterone (11KT) as a potent AR agonist, but it is unknown if 11KT is present at physiologically relevant concentrations in patients with CRPC to drive AR activation. The goal of this study was to investigate the circulating steroid metabolome including all active androgens in patients with CRPC.METHODSPatients with metastatic CRPC (n = 29) starting a new line of systemic therapy were included. Sequential plasma samples were obtained for measurement of circulating steroid concentrations by multisteroid profiling employing liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Metastatic tumor biopsy samples were obtained at baseline and subjected to RNA sequencing.RESULTS11KT was the most abundant circulating active androgen in 97% of patients with CRPC (median 0.39 nmol/L, range: 0.03-2.39 nmol/L), constituting 60% (IQR 43%-79%) of the total active androgen (TA) pool. Treatment with glucocorticoids reduced 11KT by 84% (49%-89%) and testosterone by 68% (38%-79%). Circulating TA concentrations at baseline were associated with a distinct intratumor gene expression signature comprising AR-regulated genes.CONCLUSIONThe potent AR agonist 11KT is the predominant circulating active androgen in patients with CRPC and, therefore, one of the potential drivers of AR activation in CRPC. Assessment of androgen status should be extended to include 11KT, as current clinical approaches likely underestimate androgen abundance in patients with CRPC.TRIAL REGISTRATIONNetherlands Trial Register: NL5625 (NTR5732).FUNDINGDaniel den Hoed Foundation and Wellcome Trust (Investigator Award WT209492/Z/17/Z).""","""['Gido Snaterse', 'Lisanne F van Dessel', 'Job van Riet', 'Angela E Taylor', 'Michelle van der Vlugt-Daane', 'Paul Hamberg', 'Ronald de Wit', 'Jenny A Visser', 'Wiebke Arlt', 'Martijn P Lolkema', 'Johannes Hofland']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""JCI Insight""","""['Androgen receptor mutations modulate activation by 11-oxygenated androgens and glucocorticoids.', '11-Ketotestosterone and 11-Ketodihydrotestosterone in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer: Potent Androgens Which Can No Longer Be Ignored.', 'Targeting the androgen receptor signaling pathway in advanced prostate cancer.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

However, many oncologists lack access to a tumor board, and many patients have incomplete data descriptions so that tumor boards must act on imprecise criteria. We propose these limitations to be addressed through a flexible but rigorous mathematical tool that can define the probability of success of given therapies and be made readily available to the oncology community.  Methods:   We present a Bayesian approach to tumor forecasting using a multimodel framework to predict patient-specific response to different targeted therapies even when historical data are incomplete.  Results:   We demonstrate that the Bayesian decision theory's integrative power permits the simultaneous assessment of a range of therapeutic options.

ADT, however, may fail when PCa develops castration-resistance. Fatty acid synthase (FASN), a critical enzyme involved in fatty acid synthesis, is found to be up-regulated in PCa. Since enzalutamide and ADT are frequently used for the treatment of PCa, the present study aimed to unravel the underlying mechanism of combination of orlistat, an FASN inhibitor, and enzalutamide using PC3 cell line; and orlistat and castration in PC3 tumor-bearing animal model. Cytotoxicity was determined by AlamarBlue assay. Drug effects on the cell cycle and protein expressions were assayed by the flow cytometry and Western blot. Electromobility shift assay was used to evaluate the NF-κB activity. The tumor growth delay, expressions of the signaling-related proteins, and histopathology post treatments of orlistat and castration were evaluated in PC3 tumor-bearing mouse model. The results showed that orlistat arrested the PC3 cells at the G1 phase of the cell cycle and enhanced the cytotoxic effects of enzalutamide synergistically. Pretreatment with orlistat combined with castration inhibited the tumor growth significantly compared with those of castration and orlistat treatments alone in PC3 tumor-bearing mice. Combination treatment reduced both FASN and NF-κB activities and their downstream effector proteins. The present study demonstrated the synergistic effects of orlistat combined with enzalutamide in vitro and castration in vivo on human PCa.""","""['Yeu-Sheng Tyan', 'Yen-Po Lee', 'Hui-Yen Chuang', 'Wei-Hsun Wang', 'Jeng-Jong Hwang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Biosci Rep""","""['Fatty Acid Inhibition Sensitizes Androgen-Dependent and -Independent Prostate Cancer to Radiotherapy via FASN/NF-κB Pathway.', 'Targeting fatty acid synthase with ASC-J9 suppresses proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells.', 'Combination therapy with androgen receptor N-terminal domain antagonist EPI-7170 and enzalutamide yields synergistic activity in AR-V7-positive prostate cancer.', 'Darolutamide as a Second-Generation Androgen Receptor Inhibitor in the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'The evolving options in metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Cyto-IL-15 synergizes with the STING agonist ADU-S100 to eliminate prostate tumors and confer durable immunity in mouse models.', 'Orlistat Resensitizes Sorafenib-Resistance in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells through Modulating Metabolism.']"""

To provide guidance on clinical decision-making, we examined long-term and pathological outcomes of low-risk and intermediate-risk PCa patients after radical prostatectomy (RP).  Methods:   The study involved 5693 patients diagnosed between 1994 and 2019 with low-risk, FIR, and unfavorable intermediate-risk (UIR) PCa (stratification according to the AUA guidelines) who underwent RP. Pathological outcomes were compared, and Kaplan-Meier analysis determined biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years. Multiple Cox regression was used to simultaneously control for relevant confounders.  Results:   Those at FIR had higher rates of upgrading and upstaging (12.8% vs. 7.2%, p < 0.001; 19.8% vs. 12.0%, p < 0.001) as well as pathological tumor and node stage (≥ pT3a: 18.8% vs. 11.6%, p < 0.001; pN1: 2.7% vs. 0.8%, p > 0.001) compared to patients at low risk. The 20-year BRFS was 69%, 65%, and 44% and the 20-year CSS was 98%, 95%, and 89% in low-risk, FIR, and UIR patients. On multiple Cox regression, FIR was not associated with a worse BRFS (HR 1.07, CI 0.87-1.32), UIR was associated with a worse BRFS (HR 1.49, CI 1.20-1.85).

To date, a population-based analysis of risk factors and outcomes of prostatic abscess has not been performed.  Methods:   Using the National Inpatient Sample from 2010 to 2015, we identified rates of prostatic abscess among non-elective hospitalizations for acute prostatitis. Significant Elixhauser comorbidities and risk factors were analyzed using survey-weighted logistic regression. Additional survey-weighted regression models were constructed to analyze sepsis, in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay (LOS), and total hospital charges.  Results:   A weighted total of 126,103 hospitalizations for acute prostatitis was identified, with 6,775 (5.4%) hospitalizations with prostatic abscess. Numerous risk factors for prostatic abscess were identified, with a history of prostate biopsy (adjusted OR: 5.7; p < 0.001), complicated diabetes mellitus (adjusted OR: 3.23, p < 0.001), and urethral stricture (adjusted OR: 3.15; p < 0.001) having the greatest magnitude of developing abscess. Moreover, those diagnosed with prostatic abscess had increased odds of sepsis (adjusted OR: 1.71, p < 0.001), in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR: 2.73, p < 0.001), LOS (adjusted Incidence Rate Ratio: 1.86, p < 0.001), and total hospital charges (adjusted Ratio: 2.06, p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Numerous risk factors were associated with the development of prostatic abscess, with those diagnosed experiencing greater odds of sepsis, in-hospital mortality, longer LOS, and greater hospital charges.

Methods:   Within the SEER database (2004-2016), we retrospectively identified patients with stage T2N0M0 UCUB. Competing risks regression (CRR) tested cancer-specific mortality (CSM) and adjusted for other-cause mortality after MMT vs. RC. Exact matching for age was applied. Subgroup analyses focused on differences in chemotherapy or lymph node dissection rates. In sensitivity analyses, we accounted for 40% understaging rate in patients who underwent MMT.  Results:   Of 9862 patients with T2N0M0 UCUB, 2675 (27.1%) underwent MMT vs. 5751 (58.3%) RC vs. 1436 (14.6%) radiotherapy (RT) without chemotherapy. MMT rate increased (annually +3.0%, P < .01) and MMT patient age was significantly higher (median 77 years) than RC patient age (68 years). In exact age-matched analyses, 10-year CSM rates were 44.3% vs. 25.9% for MMT vs. RC (multivariate hazard ratio [HR] 0.48); 44.1% vs. 22.8% for MMT vs. RC with chemotherapy (HR 0.43); 40.5% vs. 31.1% for MMT vs. RC without lymph node dissection (HR 0.66), and 55.6% vs. 27.3% for RT without chemotherapy vs. RC (HR 0.37, all P < .001). Sensitivity analyses that addressed understaging of patients who underwent MMT resulted in virtually the same CSM rates.

We explored whether combining TMB with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and pretreatment neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was associated with improved outcomes in ICI-treated NSCLC.  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed patients treated with ICI with Foundation One genomic testing, including TMB. Optimal cutoff for prediction of response by TMB was determined by receiver operating characteristic analysis, and area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for all 3 biomarkers and combinations. Cox model was used to assess prognostic factors of overall survival (OS) and time to progression (TTP). Survival cutoffs calculated with Kaplan-Meier survival curves were TMB ≥10 mut/Mb, PD-L1 ≥50%, NLR <5, and combined biomarkers.  Results:   Data from 88 patients treated were analyzed. The optimal TMB cutoff was 9.24 mut/Mb (AUC, 0.62), improving to 0.74 combining all 3 biomarkers. Adjusted Cox model showed that TMB ≥10 mut/Mb was an independent factor of OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.31; 95% confidence interval; 0.14-0.69; P = .004) and TTP (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.27-0.77; P = .003).

It includes a feasibility assessment tool that provides the ideal dose volume histogram (DVH) for each organ at risk, based on the ideal dose falloff from the prescribed dose at the target boundary. It is important to investigate whether the PlanIQTM assessment tool (Feasibility DVHTM) can assist treatment planners who have limited to no experience in treatment planning. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate this tool's usefulness for improving the quality of treatment plans.  Materials & methods:   This study included 5 patients with prostate cancer. The treatment planners were 2 graduate students, 2 undergraduate students, and one clinical planner. All students were radiological technology and medical physics students with no clinical experience. Two different volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans were developed before and after Feasibility DVHTM. The quality of each treatment plan was evaluated based on a scoring system implemented in PlanIQTM.  Results:   Of 5 patients included, 4 received improved treatment plans when Feasibility DVHTM was used. Moreover, 4 of 5 treatment planners showed improvement in treatment planning using Feasibility DVHTM.  Conclusions:   The findings suggest that using the Feasibility DVHTM tool may improve treatment plans for different planners and patients. However, planners at any level of experience should be trained to check the dose distribution in addition to checking the DVH, which depends on the adequacy of the contours.""","""['Motoharu Sasaki', 'Yuji Nakaguchi', 'Takeshi Kamomae', 'Akimi Kajino', 'Hitoshi Ikushima']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Dosim""","""['Analysis of prostate intensity- and volumetric-modulated arc radiation therapy planning quality with PlanIQTM.', 'Assessment of PlanIQ Feasibility DVH for head and neck treatment planning.', 'Impact of DVH Outliers Registered in Knowledge-based Planning on Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy Treatment Planning for Prostate Cancer.', 'Multicriteria optimization informed VMAT planning.', 'Artificial intelligence applications in intensity modulated radiation treatment planning: an overview.', 'Estimation of the risk of secondary cancer in rectum and bladder after radiation therapy for prostate cancer using a feasibility dose-volume histogram.', 'Predicting the complexity of head-and-neck volumetric-modulated arc therapy planning using a radiation therapy planning quality assurance software.']"""

Methods:   Patients with breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer (n = 1206) participated in a nationwide cross-sectional study. Cancer patients' sociodemographic and treatment-related characteristics as well as self-reported PA levels (pre- and post-diagnosis) were assessed. PA counseling was queried according to the counseling steps of the 5As framework (Assess/Advise/Agree/Assist/Arrange). For a subsample (n = 135), matched patient-physician data were available.  Results:   Patient-reported PA counseling was categorized into ""no counseling"" (indicated by 20.8% of participants), ""basic counseling"" (Assess and/or Advise; 58.8%), and ""in-depth counseling"" (Agree, Assist, and/or Arrange; 20.4%). ""In-depth counseling"" was associated with an increase in PA levels pre- to post-diagnosis. This relationship was enhanced for patients with metastases. There were low agreements between patients' and physicians' reporting of PA counseling steps.  Conclusion:   In-depth PA counseling is rarely provided to cancer patients but seems to be required to affect PA levels.

This hindrance can often introduce technical biases when integrating patient datasets and increase experimental costs. Although tissue preservation methods have been previously explored to address such issues, it is yet to be examined on complex human tissues, such as solid cancers and on high throughput scRNA-Seq platforms.  Methods:   Using the Chromium 10X platform, we sequenced a total of ~ 120,000 cells from fresh and cryopreserved replicates across three primary breast cancers, two primary prostate cancers and a cutaneous melanoma. We performed detailed analyses between cells from each condition to assess the effects of cryopreservation on cellular heterogeneity, cell quality, clustering and the identification of gene ontologies. In addition, we performed single-cell immunophenotyping using CITE-Seq on a single breast cancer sample cryopreserved as solid tissue fragments.  Results:   Tumour heterogeneity identified from fresh tissues was largely conserved in cryopreserved replicates. We show that sequencing of single cells prepared from cryopreserved tissue fragments or from cryopreserved cell suspensions is comparable to sequenced cells prepared from fresh tissue, with cryopreserved cell suspensions displaying higher correlations with fresh tissue in gene expression. We showed that cryopreservation had minimal impacts on the results of downstream analyses such as biological pathway enrichment. For some tumours, cryopreservation modestly increased cell stress signatures compared to freshly analysed tissue. Further, we demonstrate the advantage of cryopreserving whole-cells for detecting cell-surface proteins using CITE-Seq, which is impossible using other preservation methods such as single nuclei-sequencing.  Conclusions:   We show that the viable cryopreservation of human cancers provides high-quality single-cells for multi-omics analysis.

Methods:   We relied on the 2004-2006 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database to identify Caucasian, African American, Hispanic/Latino and Asian metastatic prostate cancer patients. Social Security Administration life tables were used to compute 10-year life expectancy for comparisons with observed overall survival. Poisson regression plots showed cancer-specific mortality relative to other-cause mortality for each race/ethnicity.

This study aims to develop a deep learning-based algorithm to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) 3D US images only reliant on the acquired sparsely distributed 2D images.  Methods:   We propose a self-supervised learning framework using cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (cycleGAN), where two independent cycleGAN models are trained with paired original US images and two sets of low-resolution (LR) US images, respectively. The two sets of LR US images are obtained through down-sampling the original US images along the two axes, respectively. In US imaging, in-plane spatial resolution is generally much higher than through-plane resolution. By learning the mapping from down-sampled in-plane LR images to original HR US images, cycleGAN can generate through-plane HR images from original sparely distributed 2D images. Finally, HR 3D US images are reconstructed by combining the generated 2D images from the two cycleGAN models.  Results:   The proposed method was assessed on two different datasets. One is automatic breast ultrasound (ABUS) images from 70 breast cancer patients, the other is collected from 45 prostate cancer patients. By applying a spatial resolution enhancement factor of 3 to the breast cases, our proposed method achieved the mean absolute error (MAE) value of 0.90 ± 0.15, the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) value of 37.88 ± 0.88 dB, and the visual information fidelity (VIF) value of 0.69 ± 0.01, which significantly outperforms bicubic interpolation. Similar performances have been achieved using the enhancement factor of 5 in these breast cases and using the enhancement factors of 5 and 10 in the prostate cases.  Conclusions:   We have proposed and investigated a new deep learning-based algorithm for reconstructing HR 3D US images from sparely acquired 2D images. Significant improvement on through-plane resolution has been achieved by only using the acquired 2D images without any external atlas images. Its self-supervision capability could accelerate HR US imaging.""","""['Xianjin Dai', 'Yang Lei', 'Tonghe Wang', 'Marian Axente', 'Dong Xu', 'Pretesh Patel', 'Ashesh B Jani', 'Walter J Curran', 'Tian Liu', 'Xiaofeng Yang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Synthesizing high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging using parallel cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks for fast magnetic resonance imaging.', 'MRI super-resolution reconstruction for MRI-guided adaptive radiotherapy using cascaded deep learning: In the presence of limited training data and unknown translation model.', 'Automatic prostate segmentation using deep learning on clinically diverse 3D transrectal ultrasound images.', 'CT artifact correction for sparse and truncated projection data using generative adversarial networks.', 'Current Advances in Computational Lung Ultrasound Imaging: A Review.', '2D medical image synthesis using transformer-based denoising diffusion probabilistic model.']"""

Cross-sectional data from 12- to 24-month follow-up were used as estimation and validation datasets, respectively. Participants' SF-12 scores were used to generate SF-6D utilities in both datasets. Beta regression mixture models were used to evaluate SF-6D utilities as a function of MAX-PC scores, race, education, marital status, income, employment status, having health insurance, year of cancer diagnosis and clinically significant prostate cancer-related anxiety (PCRA) status in the estimation dataset. Models' predictive accuracies (using mean absolute error [MAE], root mean squared error [RMSE], Akaike information criterion [AIC] and Bayesian information criterion [BIC]) were examined in both datasets.

This study aimed to compare secondary cancer risk (SCR) associated with primary field, scatter/leakage radiations and image-guided procedure in prostate treatment using intensity-modulated RT (IMRT), CyberKnife stereotactic body RT (CK-SBRT) in relative to 3-dimensional conformal RT (3D-CRT). Prostate plans were generated for 3D-CRT, IMRT (39 fractions of 2 Gy), and CK-SBRT (five fractions of 7.25 Gy). Excess absolute risk (EAR) was calculated for organs in the primary field using Schneider's mechanistic model and concept of organ equivalent dose (OED) to account for dose inhomogeneity. Doses from image-guided procedure and scatter/leakage radiations were determined by phantom measurements. The results showed that hypofractionation relative to conventional fractionation yielded lower SCR for organs in primary field (p ≤ 0.0001). SCR was further modulated by dose-volume distribution. For organs near the field edge, like the rectum and pelvic bone, CK-SBRT plan rendered better risk profiles than IMRT and 3D-CRT because of the absence of volume peak in high dose region (relative risk [RR]: 0.65, 0.22, respectively, p ≤ 0.0004). CK-SBRT and IMRT generated more scatter/leakage and imaging doses than 3D-CRT (p ≤ 0.0002). But primary field was the major contributor to SCR. EAR estimates (risk contributions, primary field: scatter/leakage radiations: imaging procedure) were 7.1 excess cases per 104 person-year (PY; 3.64:2.25:1) for CK-SBRT, 9.93 (7.32:2.33:1) for IMRT and 8.24 (15.99:2.35:1) for 3D-CRT (p ≤ 0.0002).

Methods:   29 esophageal cancer patients underwent six T2-weighted MRI scans at weekly intervals. An online bone-match image-guided radiotherapy treatment of five fractions was simulated for each patient. Multiple conformal treatment plans with increasing margins around the CTV were created for each patient. Then, the dose was warped to obtain an accumulated dose per simulated fraction. Full target coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose was assessed as a function of margin expansion in six directions. If target coverage in a single direction was accomplished, then the respective margin remained fixed for the subsequent dose plans. Margins in uncovered directions were increased in a new dose plan until full target coverage was achieved.  Results:   The smallest set of CTV-to-PTV margins that yielded full dosimetric CTV coverage was 8 mm in posterior and right direction, 9 mm in anterior and cranial direction and 10 mm in left and caudal direction for 27 out of 29 patients. In two patients the curvature of the esophagus considerably changed between fractions, which required a 17 and 23 mm margin in right direction.  Conclusion:   Accumulated dose analysis revealed that CTV-to-PTV treatment margins of 8, 9 and 10 mm in posterior & right, anterior & cranial and left & caudal direction, respectively, are sufficient to account for interfraction tumor variations over the course of treatment when applying a daily online bone match.

Material and methods:   An air-inflated (150 cm3) endorectal balloon and Foley catheter with three electromagnetic beacon transponders (EBT) were used to mitigate and track intra-fractional target motion. A 2 mm margin was used for PTV expansion, reduced to 0 mm at the interface with critical OARs. EBT-detected ≥ 2 mm/5 s motions mandated treatment interruption and target realignment prior to completion of planned dose delivery. Geometrical uncertainties were measured with an in-house ESAPI script.  Results:   Quantitative data were obtained in 886 sessions from 189 patients. Mean PTV dose was 45.8 ± 0.4 Gy (D95 = 40.5 ± 0.4 Gy). A mean of 3.7 ± 1.7 CBCTs were acquired to reach reference position.

We tested this hypothesis within a contemporary North American cohort.  Material and methods:   We relied on the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database 2010-2016. The effect of race/ethnicity was tested in univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses predicting definitive treatment administration. Treatment rates (no local treatment [NLT], external beam radiotherapy [EBRT], radical prostatectomy [RP] and brachytherapy) were examined without, as well as with adjustment for age, socioeconomic status, marital status, residence type, year of diagnosis, other-cause mortality, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and clinical T stage across races/ethnicities. Moreover, temporal trend analyses were performed.  Results:   Of 15,118 septuagenarian or older low risk CaP patients, 11,509 (76.1%) were Caucasian, 1,613 (10.7%) African-American, 1,293 (8.5%) Hispanic/Latino and 703 (4.7%) Asian. No clinically meaningful differences were recorded between races/ethnicities with respect to age at diagnosis, PSA, clinical T stage and percentage of positive biopsy cores. Conversely, clinically meaningful and statistically significant differences were identified in socioeconomic status and treatment modality. Specifically, treatment rates ranged as follows: NLT 41.8-48.2, EBRT 23.0-29.9, RP 13.8-21.8 and brachytherapy 6.4-9.9% across race/ethnicies. After adjustment for patient and tumor characteristics, NLT, EBRT, RP and brachytherapy rates showed virtually no residual heterogeneity between races/ethnicities. Finally, in temporal trend analyses, EBRT rates decreased in all races/ethnicities. Conversely, RP and brachytherapy rates did not change over time.  Conclusion:   The rates of active treatment in septuagenarian or older low risk CaP patients are surprisingly elevated in all races/ethnicities, even though they decreased over time.

We therefore evaluated the impact of pretreatment PSA on risk-stratification in men with Gleason 6 prostate cancer.  Methods:   We identified men aged 18 to 75 with cT1-2cN0cM0, pre-treatment PSA < 20 ng/ml, Gleason 6 prostate cancer diagnosed from 2010 to 2016 in the National Cancer Database who underwent radical prostatectomy. The associations of patient and disease features with Gleason score upgrading or adverse pathologic features at prostatectomy were evaluated using logistic regression. To evaluate for non linear relationships between PSA and each outcome, we examined predicted marginal event rates standardized for baseline characteristics with PSA modeled using restricted cubic splines RESULTS: A total of 75,566 patients were included in the cohort. In unadjusted analyses, patients with pretreatment PSA ≥ 10 ng/ml had higher rates of Gleason core upgrading (58.8% vs. 47.9%; P< 0.001) and adverse pathologic features (19.7% vs. 10.0%; P< 0.001) compared to patients with PSA < 10 ng/ml. In multivariable analyses, PSA ≥ 10 ng/ml was associated with statistically significantly increased risks of Gleason score upgrading (OR 1.47;95%CI 1.39 - 1.55) and adverse pathologic features (OR 2.15;95%CI 2.01 - 2.30). When modeled as a non linear continuous covariate, PSA was associated with increased adjusted rates of Gleason score upgrading and adverse pathologic features without a clear dichotomization at a threshold of 10 ng/ml.  Conclusion:   Higher pretreatment PSA was independently associated with increased risks of Gleason score upgrading and adverse pathologic features at prostatectomy. Flexible modeling of the relationship between PSA and each outcome did not support dichotomization at a threshold of 10 ng/ml.

Poor knowledge increases the burden of disease, this is more so in rural settings. PCa, being gender-specific, has underlying cultural connotations. There is a dearth of evidence on the rural-cultural understanding of PCa onset. The study examined community stakeholders' knowledge, risk perception, as well as the perceived barriers to seeking PCa screening. Rosenstock's Health Belief Model provided the theoretical framing for the study.  Methods:   The study design was descriptive and a cross-sectional approach to the social constructionist ideas of the qualitative tradition was adopted. There were twenty-one interviews with purposively selected community stakeholders; Fourteen key informant (traditional healers and medical doctors) interviews and seven In-depth Interviews (traditional leaders) held in the Ijebu culture cluster of Ogun State, Nigeria. Narratives were analyzed based on the following theoretical themes: knowledge, risk perception, and perceived barriers to PCa screening. These themes derived their structures from content-analyzed findings.  Results:   Results show that traditional healers and leaders have limited scientific knowledge of PCa etiology. Folk beliefs form the basis of PCa knowledge among most stakeholders. However, all stakeholders consider PCa a threat to men. The cultural sense of 'maleness' and access to appropriate information about PCa are essential approaches to establishing perceived threat/susceptibility. Cancer health education and distance of screening facilities are primary barriers to seeking screening.

However, it remains uncertain whether it is cost-effective, especially in a population-based screening strategy.  Methods:   We used a micro-simulation model to assess the cost-effectiveness of an MRI-based prostate cancer screening in comparison to the classical prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening, at a population level. The test sensitivity parameters for the mpMRI and MRI-guided biopsy, grade misclassification rates, utility estimates, and the unit costs of different interventions were obtained from literature. We assumed the same screening attendance rate and biopsy compliance rate for both strategies. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis, consisting of 1000 model runs, was performed to estimate a mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and assess uncertainty. A €20,000 willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, and a discounting rate of 3.5% was considered in the analysis.  Results:   The MRI-based screening improved the life-years (LY) and QALYs gained by 3.5 and 3, respectively, in comparison to the classical screening pathway. Based on the probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the MRI screening pathway leads to total discounted mean incremental costs of €15,413 (95% confidence interval (CI) of €14,556-€16,272) compared to the classical screening pathway. The corresponding discounted mean incremental QALYs gained was 1.36 (95% CI of 1.31-1.40), resulting in a mean ICER of €11,355 per QALY gained. At a WTP threshold of €20,000, the MRI screening pathway has about 84% chance to be more cost-effective than the classical screening pathway.

Total RNA extracted from tissue sections was used for miRNA profiling on the Affymetrix GSC 3000 platform. Subsequently, stem-loop RT-qPCR analysis was performed to validate the expression levels of selected miRNAs. PCa cell lines were transfected with miRNA mimics or inhibitors to evaluate the effects on cell proliferation, cell migration and cell invasion.  Results:   In our profiling study, several miRNAs were found to be deregulated in CRPC compared to primary PCa tissue, of which miR-205 (- 4.5-fold; p = 0.0009), miR-92b (- 3.1 fold; p < 0.0001) were downregulated and miR-3195 (5.6-fold; p < 0.0001), miR-3687 (8.7-fold; p = 0.0006) and miR-4417 (5.0-fold; p = 0.0005) were most upregulated. While KLK3, miR-21 and miR-141 expression levels in androgen-treated VCaP and LNCaP cells were increased, the expression levels of miR-3687 and miR-4417 were reduced. None of the miRNAs were androgen-regulated in the AR-negative PC3 cell line. Overexpression of miR-3687 reduced cell migration and cell invasion, whilst miR-3195 enhanced cell migration.  Conclusion:   We have identified several novel deregulated miRNAs in CRPC tissue, including two microRNAs that are potentially involved in tumor invasion. Our data support the hypothesized involvement of miRNAs in PCa tumorigenesis and progression to CRPC. The applicability of these miRNAs as novel biomarkers for CRPC remains to be further investigated.""","""['C G H Rönnau', 'S Fussek', 'F P Smit', 'T W Aalders', 'O van Hooij', 'P M C Pinto', 'M Burchardt', 'J A Schalken', 'G W Verhaegh']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Functional roles and potential clinical application of miRNA-345-5p in prostate cancer.', 'Functional roles of miR-625-5p and miR-874-3p in the progression of castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Regulation of NCAPG by miR-99a-3p (passenger strand) inhibits cancer cell aggressiveness and is involved in CRPC.', 'MicroRNA Regulation of Androgen Receptor in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Premises, Promises, and Potentials.', 'MicroRNA in prostate cancer: Practical aspects.', 'Microfluidic-based prostate cancer model for investigating the secretion of prostate-specific antigen and microRNAs in vitro.', 'Differential Expression of miRNAs Contributes to Tumor Aggressiveness and Racial Disparity in African American Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'Preoperative serum microRNAs as potential prognostic biomarkers in ovarian clear cell carcinoma.', 'Overview of MicroRNAs as Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarkers for High-Incidence Cancers in 2021.', 'Identification of the Regulatory Targets of miR-3687 and miR-4417 in Prostate Cancer Cells Using a Proteomics Approach.']"""

Patients and methods:   A total of 292 Chinese patients with mCRPC enrolled from 8 centers. Multigene targeted sequencing was performed on 306 ctDNA samples and 23 matched tumor biopsies. The frequency of genomic alterations were compared with the Stand Up to Cancer-Prostate Cancer Foundation (SU2C-PCF) cohort. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) following standard systemic treatments for mCRPC. Cox regression analyses were performed to determine prognostic factors associated with PFS resulting from treatments for mCRPC.  Results:   In total, 33 of 36 (91.7%) mutations were found consistently between ctDNA and paired biopsy samples. The most common recurrent genomic alterations were found in AR (34.6%), TP53 (19.5%), CDK12 (15.4%), BRCA2 (13%), and RB1 (5.8%). The frequency of CDK12 alterations (15.4%) in our cohort was significantly higher than that in Western populations (5%-7%). AR amplification and TP53 and/or RB1 alterations were associated with resistance to abiraterone or docetaxel. Patients with a CDK12 defect showed rapid disease progression after abiraterone treatment. However, the clinical outcome after docetaxel treatment was similar between patients with and without CDK12 defects. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, a CDK12 defect was significantly associated with inferior PFS after abiraterone treatment. Patients with a BRCA2 defect showed marked response to both PARP inhibitors and platinum-based chemotherapy.  Conclusions:   Our study explored the genomic landscape of Chinese patients with mCRPC at different treatment stages using minimally invasive methods and evaluated the clinical implications of the driver genomic alterations on patients' response to the most widely used therapies for mCRPC.

The available evidence on the association of this exposure with cancer is still very scarce and inconsistent.  Objectives:   We aimed to study the association between greenspace exposure and all-site and site-specific (prostate, breast, colorectal, bladder, lung, and malignant melanoma of skin) cancer incidence in the GAZEL cohort.  Methods:   This study was based on over 27 years of follow-up (1989-2016) of 19,408 participants across France. We assessed the residential greenspace exposure within several buffers as well as residential proximity to green spaces (agricultural, urban, and forests) in each follow-up. We used time-dependent Cox models, controlling for time-varying personal and area-level variables, with different lags between exposure and outcome. Additional analysis was conducted according to the urban-rural residence of the participants' over follow-up.  Results:   Over the 294,645 person-years of follow-up, we registered 4075 incident cases of cancer. We found an increase in the risk for all-sites cancer with an inter-quartile range increase of Normalized Difference in Vegetation Index across different buffers (hazard ratio (HR) of 1.08; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.14 for the 100 m buffer).

Potential interactions of (-)-epicatechin and (+)-catechin with the membrane androgen receptor, ZIP9 (SLC39A9), which mediates androgen induction of apoptosis in these cancer cells, were investigated. Both (-)-epicatechin and (+)-catechin were effective competitors of [3H]-testosterone binding to PC-3 prostate cancer cells (nuclear androgen receptor-negative, nAR-null) overexpressing ZIP9 (PC3-ZIP9), with relative binding affinities of 75 % and 28 % that of testosterone, respectively. (-)-Epicatechin (200 nM) mimicked the effects of 100 nM testosterone in inducing apoptosis of PC3-ZIP9 cells, whereas (+)-catechin (concentration range 200 nM-1000 nM) did not significantly increase apoptosis and instead blocked the apoptotic response to testosterone. (-)-Epicatechin also activated androgen-dependent ZIP9 signaling pathways, inducing decreases in cAMP production and elevating intracellular free zinc levels, while (+)-catechin typically lacked these actions. Both (-)-epicatechin and (+)-catechin also bound to cell membranes of MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells (nAR-null, high ZIP9 expression). MDA-MB-468 cells showed similar apoptotic, cAMP, and free zinc signaling responses to (-)-epicatechin to those observed in PC3-ZIP9 cells, as well as antagonism by (+)-catechin of testosterone-induced apoptosis and modulation of cAMP and caspase-3 levels. Moreover, knockdown of ZIP9 expression in MDA-MB-468 cells with siRNA decreased specific [3H]-testosterone binding of both catechins and blocked the apoptotic and free zinc responses to testosterone and (-)-epicatechin.

Patients and methods:   Between July 2009 and December 2014, 506 patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma without prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease and no neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy within 12 months were randomly assigned to receive either GCB or GCP. The primary end point was OS, with secondary end points of progression-free survival, objective response, and toxicity.  Results:   With a median follow-up of 76.3 months among alive patients, the median OS was 14.5 months for patients treated with GCB and 14.3 months for patients treated with GCP (hazard ratio for death = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.05; two-sided stratified log-rank P = .14).

Prior studies have described their clinicopathologic characteristics, but the molecular features remain incompletely understood. Moreover, these neoplasms are morphologically heterogeneous and the lack of specific adjunctive markers of prostatic stromal lineage make precise definition more difficult, leading some to question whether they represent a specific tumor type. In this study, we used next-generation DNA and RNA sequencing to profile 25 primary prostatic mesenchymal neoplasms of possible specialized prostatic stromal origin, including cases originally diagnosed as PSS (11) and STUMP (14). Morphologically, the series comprised 20 cases with solid architecture (11 PSS and 9 STUMP) and 5 cases with phyllodes-like growth pattern (all STUMP). Combined DNA and RNA sequencing results demonstrated that 19/22 (86%) cases that underwent successful sequencing (either DNA or RNA) harbored pathogenic somatic variants. Except for TP53 alterations (6 cases), ATRX mutations (2 cases), and a few copy number variants (-13q, -14q, -16q and +8/8p), the findings were largely nonrecurrent. Eight gene rearrangements were found, and 4 (NAB2-STAT6, JAZF1-SUZ12, TPM3-NTRK1 and BCOR-MAML3) were useful for reclassification of the cases as specific entities. The present study shows that mesenchymal neoplasms of the prostate are morphologically and molecularly heterogeneous and include neoplasms that harbor genetic aberrations seen in specific mesenchymal tumors arising in other anatomic sites, including soft tissue and the uterus. These data suggest that tumors of purported specialized prostatic stromal origin may perhaps not represent a single diagnostic entity or specific disease group and that alternative diagnoses should be carefully considered.""","""['Andres M Acosta', 'Lynette M Sholl', 'Brendan C Dickson', 'Jesse K McKenney', 'Jennifer B Gordetsky', 'Michael R Pins', 'Adrian Marino-Enriquez', 'Fei Dong', 'Adrian M Dubuc', 'Paola Dal Cin', 'Christopher D M Fletcher']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Mod Pathol""","""['In Response to ""Reexamining the molecular findings in specialized stromal tumors of the prostate"".', 'Whole-exome sequencing demonstrates recurrent somatic copy number alterations and sporadic mutations in specialized stromal tumors of the prostate.', 'Specialized stromal tumors of the prostate: a clinicopathologic study of 50 cases.', 'Common chromosomal aberrations detected by array comparative genomic hybridization in specialized stromal tumors of the prostate.', 'Sarcomas and related proliferative lesions of specialized prostatic stroma: a clinicopathologic study of 22 cases.', 'A case report of prostatic stromal tumor of uncertain malignant potential (STUMP).', 'ARID1A deficient undifferentiated spindle cell and rhabdoid sarcoma of the prostate: report of a unique case with emphasis on diagnostic implications.', 'Low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma-like tumors in male with JAZF1 gene fusions.']"""

In two groups of healthy subjects (average age 32 and 57 years old, respectively) the total protein and RNA content was very similar between age groups, but the number of secreted extracellular vesicles (uEVs) and expression of several miRNAs were higher in the young healthy male volunteers. Timing of urine collection was not important for these parameters. We also evaluated the suitability of urinary miRNAs for non-invasive diagnosis of bladder outlet obstruction (BOO). A three urinary miRNA signature (miR-10a-5p, miR-301b-3p and miR-363-3p) could discriminate between controls and patients with LUTD (BLUTD and NLUTD).

We examined whether administering ipilimumab after sipuleucel-T could modify immune and/or clinical responses to this treatment.  Methods:   A total of 50 patients with mCRPC were enrolled into a clinical trial (NCT01804465, ClinicalTrials.gov) where they received ipilimumab either immediately or delayed 3 weeks following completion of sipuleucel-T treatment. Blood was collected at various timepoints of the study. Luminex assay for anti-prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) and anti-PA2024-specific serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and ELISpot for interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production against PAP and PA2024 were used to assess antigen-specific B and T cell responses, respectively. Clinical response was defined as >30% reduction in serum prostate-specific antigen levels compared with pretreatment levels. The frequency and state of circulating immune cells were determined by mass cytometry by time-of-flight and statistical scaffold analysis.  Results:   We found the combination to be well tolerated with no unexpected adverse events occurring. The timing of ipilimumab did not significantly alter the rates of antigen-specific B and T cell responses, the primary endpoint of the clinical trial. Clinical responses were observed in 6 of 50 patients, with 3 having responses lasting longer than 3 months. The timing of ipilimumab did not significantly associate with clinical response or toxicity. The combination treatment did induce CD4 and CD8 T cell activation that was most pronounced with the immediate schedule. Lower frequencies of CTLA-4 positive circulating T cells, even prior to treatment, were associated with better clinical outcomes. Interestingly, these differences in CTLA-4 expression were associated with prior localized radiation therapy (RT) to the prostate or prostatic fossa. Prior radiation treatment was also associated with improved radiographic progression-free survival.  Conclusion:   Combining CTLA-4 blockade with sipuleucel-T resulted in modest clinical activity. The timing of CTLA-4 blockade following sipuleucel-T did not alter antigen-specific responses.

Musculoskeletal spread of an underlying malignancy may also mimic many rheumatologic conditions. Distinguishing primary rheumatologic condition from paraneoplastic arthritides versus direct musculoskeletal spread of malignancy can be challenging especially in individuals with prior history of cancer and new musculoskeletal complaints. SAPHO (synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis and osteitis) syndrome is an uncommon, although under recognized autoimmune disorder. Two musculoskeletal manifestations, namely inflammatory osteitis and hyperostosis of anterior chest wall with or without dermatologic manifestations, constitute a unifying feature of SAPHO syndrome. However, diagnosis of SAPHO syndrome is one of exclusion, and a wide variety of disorders including infections, malignancy (chondrosarcoma/osteosarcoma/metastasis), metabolic bone disorders (Paget's disease), osteoarthritis, seronegative spondyloarthropathy (spA) and osteonecrosis form part of a broad differential diagnosis. We present the case of a man, aged 72 years, with signs and symptoms of SAPHO syndrome and skin findings. Detailed history, radiological imaging, dermatology appearance, and role of immunohistochemical markers, especially staining for NKX3.1 protein with a novel antibody, led to a diagnosis of metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma.

Despite high treatment efficiency, most patients ultimately develop lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In this study, we performed a comparative proteomic analysis of three in vivo, androgen receptor (AR)-responsive orthograft models of matched hormone-naïve prostate cancer and CRPC. Differential proteomic analysis revealed that distinct molecular mechanisms, including amino acid (AA) and fatty acid metabolism, are involved in the response to ADT in the different models. Despite this heterogeneity, Schlafen family member 5 (SLFN5) was identified as an AR-regulated protein in CRPC. SLFN5 expression was high in CRPC tumors and correlated with poor patient outcome. In vivo, SLFN5 depletion strongly impaired tumor growth in castrated conditions. Mechanistically, SLFN5 interacted with ATF4 and regulated the expression of LAT1, an essential AA transporter. Consequently, SLFN5 depletion in CRPC cells decreased intracellular levels of essential AA and impaired mTORC1 signaling in a LAT1-dependent manner. These results confirm that these orthograft models recapitulate the high degree of heterogeneity observed in patients with CRPC and further highlight SLFN5 as a clinically relevant target for CRPC.

Local and systemic therapy salvage, respectively, were delivered to 21 and 390 men after EBRT, and eight and 103 men after EBRT + BT. Overall, 435 men developed DM, and 248 were detected within 1 yr of BCR. Measured from time of recurrence, 5-yr DM rates were 50% and 34% after EBRT and EBRT + BT, respectively. Measured from BCR, 5-yr PCSM rates were 27% and 29%, respectively. Interval to BCR was independently associated with DM (p < 0.001) and PCSM (p < 0.001). These data suggest that radiorecurrent HRPCa has an aggressive natural history and that DM is clinically evident early after BCR. These findings underscore the importance of further investigations into upfront risk assessment and prompt systemic evaluation upon recurrence in HRPCa.

However, systematic analysis of the stemness of prostate cancer cells is still not abundant. In this study, we explore the effective factors related to the stemness of prostate cancer cells by comprehensively mining the multi-omics data from TCGA database.  Methods:   Based on the prostate cancer transcriptome data in TCGA, gene expression modules that strongly relate to the stemness of prostate cancer cells are obtained with WGCNA and stemness scores. Copy number variation of stemness genes of prostate cancer is calculated and the difference of transcription factors between prostate cancer and normal tissues is evaluated by using CNV (copy number variation) data and ATAC-seq data. The protein interaction network of stemness genes in prostate cancer is constructed using the STRING database. Meanwhile, the correlation between stemness genes of prostate cancer and immune cells is analyzed.  Results:   Prostate cancer with higher Gleason grade possesses higher cell stemness. The gene set highly related to prostate cancer stemness has higher CNV in prostate cancer samples than that in normal samples. Although the transcription factors of stemness genes have similar expressions, they have different contributions between normal and prostate cancer tissues; and particular transcription factors enhance the stemness of prostate cancer, such as PUM1, CLOCK, SP1, TCF12, and so on. In addition, the lower tumor immune microenvironment is conducive to the stemness of prostate cancer. CD8 + T cells and M1 macrophages may play more important role in the stemness of prostate cancer than other immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. Finally, EZH2 is found to play a central role in stemness genes and is negatively correlated with resting mast cells and positively correlated with activated memory CD4 + T cells.  Conclusions:   Based on the systematic and combined analysis of multi-omics data, we find that high copy number variation, specific transcription factors, and low immune microenvironment jointly contribute to the stemness of prostate cancer cells.

The gold standard for diagnosing lymph node invasion is a surgical lymphadenectomy, with no superior imaging modality available at the clinician's disposal. Our aim in this study is to identify if a pre-biopsy multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) can provide enough information about pelvic lymph nodes in intermediate and high risk PCa patients, and whether it can substitute further cross sectional imaging (CSI) modalities of the abdomen and pelvis in these risk categories.  Methods:   Patients with intermediate and high risk prostate cancer were collected between January 2015 and June 2019, while excluding patients who did not undergo a pre-biopsy mpMRI or a CSI. Date regarding biopsy result, PSA, MRI results, CSI imaging results were collected. Using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24.0, statistical analysis was conducted using the Cohen's Kappa agreement for comparison of mpMRI with CSI. McNemar's test and receiver operator curve (ROC) curve were used for comparison of sensitivity of both tests when comparing to the gold standard of lymphadenectomy.  Results:   A total of 143 patients fit the inclusion criteria. We further stratified our patients into according to PSA level and Gleason score. Overall, agreement between mpMRI and all CSI was 0.857. When stratifying patients based on Gleason score and PSA, the higher the grade or PSA, the higher agreement between mpMRI and CSI. The sensitivity of mpMRI (73.7%) is similar to CSI (68.4%). When comparing CSI sensitivity to that of mpMRI, no significant difference was present by utilizing the McNemar test and very similar receiver operating characteristic curve.

Several experiments were performed to evaluate the mechanical and radiofrequency safety of the needle system, the magnetic field perturbation, the calibration of the implant device in the MR coordinate system, functioning of the implant device during imaging and accuracy of needle insertion.Results. Endurance experiments showed the mechanical safety of the needle system. Magnetic field perturbation was acceptable with induced image distortions smaller than 0.5 mm for clinical MR sequences. Calibration of the implant device in the MR coordinate system was reproducible with average error (mean±standard deviation) of 0.2 ± 0.4 mm, 0.1 ± 0.3 mm and 0.6 ± 0.6 mm in thex,y- andz- direction, respectively. The RF safety measurement showed for clinical MR imaging sequences maximum temperature rises of 0.2 °C at the entry and tip points of the needle. Simultaneous functioning of the implant device and imaging is possible albeit with some intensity band artifacts in the fast field echo images. Finally, phantom measurements showed deviations amounting 2.5-3.6 mm measured as target-to-needle distance at a depth of 12 cm.Conclusions.

Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) can assess microvascular permeability by pharmacokinetic parameter estimation.

In this study, we propose an automatic framework for evaluating vascular permeability of bone metastases from prostate cancer without selecting AIF.Materials and methods.This retrospective study comprised of 15 prostate cancer patients with bone metastases. Based on clinical consensus for three typical DCE-MRI curve patterns, three characteristic curves as regularization constraints were introduced to the extended Tofts model (ETM) using clustering strategy, and the clustering-based blind identification of multichannel (CBM) framework was then proposed for pharmacokinetic parameter estimation. With automatic segmentation of the whole bone area, we obtained the estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters in the bone area and quantified for bone metastases. Two experienced radiologists compared the CBM estimations with the diagnostic results and we compared the estimations with those of the ETM in bone metastasis regions to evaluate the feasibility of the CBM framework.Results.The higher signal regions ofKtransandKepindicated the metastasis of prostate cancer, which is consistent with the cancer area marked by the radiologists. In addition, theKtransandKepin bone metastasis regions were significantly higher than in normal bone regions (P < 0.001,P < 0.001).

Objective:   The effects of LAF on the Hippo-Yes-associated protein (YAP) signalling pathway, which plays an important role in cancer progression, were explored in this study.  Materials and methods:   Cervical (HeLa), colorectal (SW480), breast (MDA-MB-231) and prostate (PC3) cancer cell lines were treated with LAF at different concentrations and different durations. BALB/c nude mice bearing colon xenografts were intravenously injected with vehicle, LAF (10 or 20 mg/kg) or paclitaxel (10 mg/kg) for 15 days. The expression and nuclear localisation of YAP were analysed using transcriptome sequencing, quantitative PCR, western blotting and immunofluorescence.  Results:   LAF suppressed the proliferation of HeLa, MDA-MB-231, SW480 and PC3 cells (IC50 values of 41.5, 26.0, 45.3 and 42.9 μmol/L, respectively, at 72 h), and this was accompanied by significant downregulation in the expression of YAP and its downstream target genes at both the mRNA and protein levels. The expression of 14-3-3σ, a protein that causes YAP cytoplasmic retention and degradation, was remarkably increased, resulting in a decrease in YAP nuclear localisation. Knockdown of 14-3-3σ with small interfering RNA partially blocked LAF-induced YAP inhibition and anti-proliferation effects.

The present study investigated the effect of ectopic ATP5B on the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells and examined the involvement of Cav-1. Cholesterol loading increased the level of ectopic ATP5B and promoted cell migration and invasion. These effects were blocked by B04. Ectopic ATP5B was physically colocalized with Cav-1, as demonstrated by double immunofluorescence staining and coimmunoprecipitation. After Cav-1 knockdown, the migration and invasion abilities of MDA-MB-231 cells were significantly decreased, suggesting that Cav-1 influences the function of ectopic ATP5B.

Methods:   A total of 262 consecutive patients referred for prostate biopsy based on abnormal digital rectal examination and/or elevated total PSA (tPSA) who had serum endoglin assessed by solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were selected. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to compare the predictive accuracy of different combinations of biomarkers to distinguish between PCa and benign prostatic conditions, and to identify cut-offs that maximize the ability of endoglin to rule out patients for biopsy (highest sensitivities).  Results:   Serum endoglin levels were higher in patients with PCa (median: 7.86 vs. 5.88 pg/mL, P < 0.001). Among patients with baseline tPSA ≤ 10 ng/mL the area under the curve was 0.69 for endoglin. Approximately one-quarter of the patients had serum endoglin < 4.92 ng/mL (sensitivity: 90.3%; specificity: 32.8%), and the probability of PCa varied from 37.7% before testing to 15.2% among those with low endoglin levels [negative predictive value (NPV) = 84.8%]. When restricting the analyses to patients with free/total PSA ratio > 0.25, the probability of cancer was less than 5% among those with serum endoglin < 6.04 ng/mL (sensitivity: 93.8%; specificity: 56.1%), corresponding to a NPV of 95.8%; this could allow sparing approximately 40% of patients from biopsy.

However, it is unknown whether Medicaid expansion through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was associated with improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with genitourinary cancer.  Objective:   To assess the association of Medicaid expansion with health insurance status, stage at diagnosis, and receipt of treatment among nonelderly patients with newly diagnosed kidney, bladder, or prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   This case-control study included adults aged 18 to 64 years with a new primary diagnosis of kidney, bladder, or prostate cancer, selected from the National Cancer Database from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2016. Patients in states that expanded Medicaid were the case group, and patients in nonexpansion states were the control group. Data were analyzed from January 2020 to March 2021.  Exposures:   State Medicaid expansion status.  Main outcomes and measures:   Insurance status, stage at diagnosis, and receipt of cancer and stage-specific treatments. Cases and controls were compared with difference-in-difference analyses.  Results:   Among a total of 340 552 patients with newly diagnosed genitourinary cancers, 94 033 (27.6%) had kidney cancer, 25 770 (7.6%) had bladder cancer, and 220 749 (64.8%) had prostate cancer. Medicaid expansion was associated with a net decrease in uninsured rate of 1.1 (95% CI, -1.4 to -0.8) percentage points across all incomes and a net decrease in the low-income population of 4.4 (95% CI, -5.7 to -3.0) percentage points compared with nonexpansion states. Expansion was also associated with a significant shift toward early-stage diagnosis in kidney cancer across all income levels (difference-in-difference, 1.4 [95% CI, 0.1 to 2.6] percentage points) and among individuals with low income (difference-in-difference, 4.6 [95% CI, 0.3 to 9.0] percentage points) and in prostate cancer among individuals with low income (difference-in-difference, 3.0 [95% CI, 0.3 to 5.7] percentage points). Additionally, there was a net increase associated with expansion compared with nonexpansion in receipt of active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer of 4.1 (95% CI, 2.9 to 5.3) percentage points across incomes and 4.5 (95% CI, 0 to 9.0) percentage points among patients in low-income areas.  Conclusions and relevance:   These findings suggest that Medicaid expansion was associated with decreases in uninsured status, increases in the proportion of kidney and prostate cancer diagnosed in an early stage, and higher rates of active surveillance in the appropriate, low-risk prostate cancer population. Associations were concentrated in population residing in low-income areas and reinforce the importance of improving access to care to all patients with cancer.""","""['Katharine F Michel', 'Aleigha Spaulding', 'Ahmedin Jemal', 'K Robin Yabroff', 'Daniel J Lee', 'Xuesong Han']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Comparison of Insurance Status and Diagnosis Stage Among Patients With Newly Diagnosed Cancer Before vs After Implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.', 'Surveillance for Health Care Access and Health Services Use, Adults Aged 18-64 Years - Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, United States, 2014.', 'Association of Medicaid Expansion Under the Affordable Care Act With Stage at Diagnosis and Time to Treatment Initiation for Patients With Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Understanding the Implications of Medicaid Expansion for Cancer Care in the US: A Review.', 'The Uninsured in America: Estimates of the Percentage of Non-Elderly Adults Uninsured throughout Each Calendar Year, by Selected Population Subgroups and State Medicaid Expansion Status: 2013 and 2014.', 'The Impact of Medicaid Expansion on Patients with Cancer in the United States: A Review.', 'Cancer-Specific health equity metrics in the United States of America: A scoping review.', 'Changes in survival over time for primary brain and other CNS tumors in the United States, 2004-2017.']"""

This 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor is commonly used for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic enlargement. The modulation of PSMA expression might affect PSMA-based prostate cancer imaging and therapy.  Aim:   The purpose of this work was to further analyze concentration-dependent effects of Dutasteride on PSMA expression in a mouse xenograft model.  Methods and results:   Four groups of mice bearing LNCaP xenografts were treated for 14 days with daily intraperitoneal injections of either vehicle control or different concentrations of Dutasteride (0.1, 1, 10 mg/kg). Total expression of PSMA, androgen receptor (AR), and caspase-3 protein was analyzed using immunoblotting (WES). In addition, PSMA, cleaved caspase-3 and Ki-67 expression was assessed and quantified by immunohistochemistry. Tumor size was measured by caliper on day 7 and 14, tumor weight was assessed following tissue harvesting. The mean PSMA protein expression in mice increased significantly after treatment with 1 mg/kg (10-fold) or 10 mg/kg (sixfold) of Dutasteride compared to vehicle control. The mean fluorescence intensity significantly increased by daily injections of 0.1 mg/kg Dutasteride (1.6-fold) as well as 1 and 10 mg/kg Dutasteride (twofold). While the reduction in tumor volume following treatment with high concentrations of 10 mg/kg Dutasteride was nonsignificant, no changes in AR, caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, and Ki-67 expression were observed.  Conclusion:   Short-term Dutasteride treatments with concentrations of 1 and 10 mg/kg significantly increase the total PSMA protein expression in a mouse LNCaP xenograft model. PSMA fluorescence intensity increases significantly even using lower daily concentrations of 0.1 mg/kg Dutasteride.

The population of interest was castrate-sensitive oligorecurrent PC, defined as the presence of 1-3 uptakes in non-visceral sites such as bones or nodes detected by means of 18F-Choline PET/CT or 68-Gallium PSMA PET/CT. Primary endpoint was the time to castration resistance. Secondary endpoints were ADT-free survival, local progression-free survival, and overall survival. Eighty-two patients and 118 lesions were analyzed. The median time to castration resistance for the entire population of the study was 49 months (95% CI 43.6-54.4 months). The 1- and 2-year TTCR-free survival rates were 94% and 82%, respectively. At the time of analysis, 52 patients were still in the castration-sensitive phase of the disease. In this cohort of patients, the median ADT-free survival was 20 months (range 3-69 months). On the other hand, during follow-up 30 patients switched to the castration-resistant phase of disease. In this last group of patients, the median ADT-free survival was 20 months (range 4-50 months). After the ADT administration, the median castration-sensitive phase was 29 months (range 5-71 months).

Methods:   Questionnaire data (2006-2009) from participants aged 45-64 years (n=163,556) from the population-based 45 and Up Study (n=267,153) in New South Wales, Australia, were linked to cancer registrations to ascertain cancer diagnoses up to enrolment. Modified Poisson regression estimated age- and sex-adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) for non-participation in the paid workforce-in participants with cancer (n=8,333) versus without (n=155,223), for 13 cancer types.  Results:   Overall, 42% of cancer survivors and 29% of people without cancer were out of the workforce (PR=1.18; 95%CI=1.15-1.21). Workforce non-participation varied substantively by cancer type, being greatest for multiple myeloma (1.83; 1.53-2.18), oesophageal (1.70; 1.13-2.58) and lung cancer (1.68; 1.45-1.93) and moderate for colorectal (1.23; 1.15-1.33), breast (1.11; 1.06-1.16) and prostate cancer (1.06; 0.99-1.13). Long-term survivors, 5 or more years post-diagnosis, had 12% (7-16%) greater non-participation than people without cancer, and non-participation was greater with recent diagnosis, treatment or advanced stage. Physical disability contributed substantively to reduced workforce participation, regardless of cancer diagnosis.  Conclusions:   Cancer survivors aged 45-64 continue to participate in the workforce. However, participation is lower than in people without cancer, varying by cancer type, and is reduced particularly around the time of diagnosis and treatment and with advanced disease.  Implications for cancer survivors:   While many cancer survivors continue with paid work, participation is reduced.

We compared RS and CSS in men with prostate cancer (PCa) according to age and risk category, using Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden, including 168,793 men younger than age 90 years, diagnosed 1998-2016 with PCa. RS and CSS were compared according to age and risk category based on TNM (tumor, nodes, and metastases) stage, Gleason score, and prostate-specific antigen level. Each framework requires assumptions that are unlikely to be appropriate for PCa. Ten-year RS was substantially higher than CSS in men aged 80-89 with low-risk PCa: 125% (95% confidence interval: 113, 138) versus 85% (95% confidence interval: 82, 88). In contrast, RS and CSS were similar for men under age 70 and for all men with regional or distant metastases. Both RS and CSS produce biased estimates of net survival for men with low- and intermediate-risk PCa, in particular for men over 80. Due to biases, net survival is overestimated in analysis of RS but underestimated in analysis of CSS. These results highlight the importance of evaluating the underlying assumptions for each method, because the ""true"" net survival is expected to lie between the limits of RS and CSS.""","""['Andri Wilberg Orrason', 'Hans Garmo', 'Johan Styrke', 'Paul W Dickman', 'Pär Stattin']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Am J Epidemiol""","""['Long-term outcomes among noncuratively treated men according to prostate cancer risk category in a nationwide, population-based study.', 'Mortality among men with locally advanced prostate cancer managed with noncurative intent: a nationwide study in PCBaSe Sweden.', 'Distant metastases following permanent interstitial brachytherapy for patients with clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Radical Prostatectomy Versus Radiation and Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer: How Good Is the Evidence?', 'Evidence of cancer progression as the cause of death in men with prostate cancer in Sweden.', 'Changes in Characteristics of Men with Lethal Prostate Cancer During the Past 25 Years: Description of Population-based Deaths.']"""

Methods:   Thirty-six rats including 26 male wild-type SD rats and 10 transgenic rats were fed to 3- or 18-month-old and divided into three groups: young WTR (yWTR) as the control (n = 16), aged WTR (aWTR) (n = 10), and aged TGR (aTGR) (n = 10). The prostates of the three groups of rats (10 rats per group) were harvested to evaluate the levels of KLK1 expression, oxidative stress, fibrosis, and involved signaling pathways, such as NO/cGMP, COX-2/PTGIS/cAMP, and TGF-β1/RhoA/ROCK1, via quantitative PCR, Western blot, histological examinations, and ELISA. Moreover, the remaining 6 yWTRs were sacrificed to obtain primary prostate fibroblast and aortic endothelial cells, and a coculture system was built with the cells for the verification of above signaling pathways in vitro. And the direct effects of bradykinin on prostate cells were detected by MTT experiment. Prostate specimens of 47 patients (age from 48 to 92 years) undergoing BPH surgery were collected after approval. Histological examinations and KLK1 IHC were preformed to analyze the relationship between KLK1 expression and age and prostate fibrosis.  Results:   The human KLK1 gene only existed and was expressed in aTGR. The prostate of young rats expressed more KLK1 than the aged and the expression of KLK1 in prostate decreased with age in humans (r = -0.347, P = 0.018). Compared to the aWTR group, the yWTR and aTGR groups showed milder fibrosis, less oxidative stress, upregulated NO/cGMP, and COX-2/PTGIS/cAMP signaling pathways and inhibited TGF-β1/RhoA/ROCK1 signaling pathway. In the coculture system, KLK1 suppressed TGF-β1-mediated fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation via cleaving LMWK to produce the BK which upregulate eNOS expression and NO production in endothelial cells. BK not only slightly stimulated the proliferation ability of prostatic stromal cells but also upregulated iNOS and inhibited TGF-β1 expression in them.  Conclusion:   KLK1 protects prostate from oxidative stress and fibrosis via amplified NO/cGMP signal in aged rats. The decrease of KLK1 expression with aging is laying the groundwork for the application of KLK1 to the treatment of human BPH. The current experimental data showed that the side effects of KLK1 on the prostate cell were not obvious.""","""['Mengyang Zhang', 'Changcheng Luo', 'Dongxu Lin', 'Kai Cui', 'Zhong Chen', 'Jihong Liu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Oxid Med Cell Longev""","""['Tissue Kallikrein Protects Rat Prostate against the Inflammatory Damage in a Chronic Autoimmune Prostatitis Model via Restoring Endothelial Function in a Bradykinin Receptor B2-Dependent Way.', 'Preserved Erectile Function in the Aged Transgenic Rat Harboring Human Tissue Kallikrein 1.', 'Involvement of DDAH/ADMA/NOS/cGMP and COX-2/PTGIS/cAMP Pathways in Human Tissue Kallikrein 1 Protecting Erectile Function in Aged Rats.', 'Genetically‑modified stem cells in treatment of human diseases: Tissue kallikrein (KLK1)‑based targeted therapy (Review).', 'Genetic deficiency in tissue kallikrein activity in mouse and man: effect on arteries, heart and kidney.', 'A new risk model for CSTA, FAM83A, and MYCT1 predicts poor prognosis and is related to immune infiltration in lung squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Tissue Kallikrein Protects Rat Prostate against the Inflammatory Damage in a Chronic Autoimmune Prostatitis Model via Restoring Endothelial Function in a Bradykinin Receptor B2-Dependent Way.']"""

Patients were assessed in a pretherapy visit prior to receiving SCTE-AI and re-assessed 6 weeks after treatment initiation. Patients with a history of prostate cancer were excluded. Trough serum total testosterone (TT), estradiol (E2), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and hematocrit (HCT) levels were collected at clinic visits. Therapeutic phlebotomy was recommended for HCT > 54%, and treatment was discontinued for significant increases in PSA as well as for significant treatment-related adverse events.

Inclusion criteria were stage cT ≤ 2, ≥5 years of life expectancy, grade group ≤3. Multiparametric magnetic resonance was performed before ablation. Patients with a prostate volume of ≥80 ml underwent debulking. Treatment failure was defined as a histologically confirmed tumor that required salvage treatment or androgen deprivation therapy.  Results:   One hundred and eighty nine patients were enrolled. Data are presented as median and Interquartile Range (IQR). Median age was 70(11) years. Median baseline PSA was 5.8(3) ng/ml. Fourteen (7.4%) patients had prostate debulking before ablation. 104 (55%) patients underwent targeted ablation, 45 (23.8%) extended targeted ablation, 31 (16.4%) hemiablation, and 9 (4.8%) extended hemiablation. Median targeted ablated volume was 14(9) ml. Ninety-three complications occurred in 63/189 (33.3%) patients within 90 days. There were 77/93 (82.8%) minor (Clavien grade 1-2) and 16/93 (17.2%) major complications (Clavien grade 3a). Thirty-nine patients suffered from genito-urinary infections (Clavien grade 2). Fifteen patients required transurethral resection of the prostate/urethrotomy for recurrent urinary retention (Clavien grade 3a). One patient developed a recto-urethral fistula (Clavien grade 3a) and two long-lasting urinary incontinence. Median PSA nadir was 2.2(2.9) ng/ml. At a median follow-up of 29(15) months, 21/177 (11.9%) patients were treatment failures, 26 on monitoring, and 26 had a further ablation. Multivariable logistic regression found that failure patients had higher PSA (7.8 vs 5.7 ng/ml,p0.001) and double PSA nadir (4.8 vs 2.0 ng/ml, p < 0.001). Higher PSA nadir correlated with a 74% higher probability of failure (OR 1.74 95% CI 1.40-2.16). Cancer in the anterior stroma increased the odds of failure of three folds (OR 3.36 95% CI 1.18-9.53). Two mixed effect models (one for IPSS and one for IEEF-15) were estimated and they showed that time reaches the statistical significance coefficient only for the IEEF-15, meaning that subsequent evaluations of the indicators were significantly lower at each time point.

Methods:   In a post-hoc analysis of this trial, we assessed patient characteristics and OS in patients ≥70 years (""older men"") versus <70 years (""younger men"") with Cox proportional hazards models. In addition, we compared adverse events, therapy completion rate, and subsequent treatment patterns between these two groups using Chi-squared tests.  Results:   177 (22.4%) patients were ≥70 years. Docetaxel + ADT resulted in improved OS in both older and younger men (Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.45, 95%CI: 0.25-0.80 for older men; HR 0.71, 95%CI: 0.53-0.95 for younger men). This treatment benefit was seen for subgroups of older men with high volume disease (HR 0.43, 95%CI 0.23-0.79) and de novo metastatic disease (HR 0.36, 95%CI 0.19-0.69). A similar proportion of older and younger men completed six cycles of docetaxel (82.6% vs. 87.1%, p = 0.28). Rates of grade 3-5 adverse events were similar between older and younger men (36.8% vs. 26.8%, respectively, p = 0.069). The rate of any Grades 4-5 adverse events did not differ significantly between older and younger men (14.9% vs. 11.9%, respectively, p = 0.46).

We assessed its effect on the risk of PCa reclassification (PCaR) during active surveillance.  Methods:   Anthropometric, demographic, and clinical data concerning men diagnosed with a low-risk PCa and initially managed with active surveillance at the two participating institutions were retrospectively collected. The Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) was used for patients' self-assessment of their daily exercise and their consequent stratification into three groups: sedentary (PASE ≤ 65), moderately active (65 < PASE < 125), active (PASE ≥ 125). Kaplan-Meier model was used to evaluate the predictive role of PA on PCaR, computed at 2, 5, 10 years after diagnosis; differences between lifestyle groups were assessed using the log-rank and uni-/multivariable Cox analyses applied to identify predictors of reclassification.  Results:   Eighty-five patients were included in the analysis, with a median age of 66 years (IQR: 59-70); 16% were active, 45% were former smokers, and 3 presented with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density was 0.12 (IQR: 0.07-0.15); 34 men showed a PSA doubling time <10 years. The Median PASE score was 86 (IQR: 61.5-115.8): 24 patients were sedentary, 46 moderately active, and 15 active. At a median follow-up of 37 months (IQR: 14-53), 25% of patients experienced PCaR. These were less physically active (PASE score 69.3 vs 87.8; p = 0.056) and presented with significantly smaller prostates (46 ml vs 50.7 ml; p = 0.001) and a higher PSAD (0.14 vs 0.10; p = 0.019). At 2 years, the risk of reclassification was 25 ± 5%, while it was 38 ± 7% at both 5 and 10 years. The risk was significantly different in the three PA groups (Log Rank p = 0.033). PASE score was the only independent predictor of PCaR (HR: 0.987; 95%CI: 0.977-0.998; p = 0.016).

The objective of our study is to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on the incidence of cancer diagnoses in primary care.  Design:   Time-series study of malignant neoplasms and diagnostic procedures, using data from the primary care electronic health records from January 2014 to September 2020.  Setting:   Primary care, Catalonia, Spain.  Participants:   People older than 14 years and assigned in one of the primary care practices of the Catalan Institute of Health with a new diagnosis of malignant neoplasm.  Main outcome measures:   We obtained the monthly expected incidence of malignant neoplasms using a temporary regression, where the response variable was the incidence of cancer from 2014 to 2018 and the adjustment variables were the trend and seasonality of the time series. Excess or lack of malignant neoplasms was defined as the number of observed minus expected cases, globally and stratified by sex, age, type of cancer and socioeconomic status.  Results:   Between March and September 2020 we observed 8766 (95% CI 4135 to 13 397) fewer malignant neoplasm diagnoses, representing a reduction of 34% (95% CI 19.5% to 44.1%) compared with the expected. This underdiagnosis was greater in individuals aged older than 64 years, men and in some types of cancers (skin, colorectal, prostate). Although the reduction was predominantly focused during the lockdown, expected figures have not yet been reached (40.5% reduction during the lockdown and 24.3% reduction after that).  Conclusions:   Reduction in cancer incidence has been observed during and after the lockdown. Urgent policy interventions are necessary to mitigate the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related control measures on other diseases and some strategies must be designed in order to reduce the underdiagnosis of cancer.""","""['Ermengol Coma', 'Carolina Guiriguet', 'Nuria Mora', 'Mercè Marzo-Castillejo', 'Mencia Benítez', 'Leonardo Méndez-Boo', 'Francesc Fina', 'Mireia Fàbregas', 'Albert Mercadé', 'Manuel Medina']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BMJ Open""","""['Cancer diagnosis in primary care after second pandemic year in Catalonia: a time-series analysis of primary care electronic health records covering about 5 million people.', 'Excess cases of influenza and the coronavirus epidemic in Catalonia: a time-series analysis of primary-care electronic medical records covering over 6 million people.', 'Divergences on expected pneumonia cases during the COVID-19 epidemic in Catalonia: a time-series analysis of primary care electronic health records covering about 6 million people.', 'Effect of national and local lockdowns on the control of COVID-19 pandemic: a rapid review.', 'Pandemic lockdown, healthcare policies and human rights: integrating opposed views on COVID-19 public health mitigation measures.', 'Mortality in Catalonia during the summer of 2022 and its relation with high temperatures and COVID-19 cases.', 'Changes in all-cause and cause-specific excess mortality before and after the Omicron outbreak of COVID-19 in Hong Kong.', 'Open data for monitoring COVID-19 in Spain: Descriptive study.', 'Impact of delayed screening invitations on screen-detected and interval cancers in the Dutch colorectal cancer screening programme: individual-level data analysis.', 'Cancer stage and time from cancer diagnosis to first treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic.']"""

Hypothesis:   We examined the potential impact of LEE in affecting the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and promoting apoptosis in human multiple myeloma (MM) cells.  Methods:   We evaluated the effect of LEE on STAT3 signaling pathway in MM cells by using Western blot analysis and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Thereafter, apoptosis was evaluated using cell cycle analysis and Annexin V assay.  Results:   We noted that LEE could attenuate the phosphorylation of STAT3 and other up-stream signaling molecules such as JAK1, JAK2, and Src activation in U266 and MM.1S cells. It also diminished STAT3 translocation into the nucleus and enhanced the expression of protein-tyrosine phosphatase epsilon (PTPε). Additionally, LEE caused cell cycle arrest and synergistically augmented the apoptotic actions of bortezomib against MM cells.

The purpose of this study is to quantitatively determine the impact on cancer diagnostic service in public facilities across Hong Kong. Quantifying the temporal changes in the number of cancer diagnoses before, during, and after the outbreak is useful to establish the scale of the problem and assess if there has been an adequate level of response.  Methods and materials:   This is a retrospective cohort study using a territory-wide database in Hong Kong from 2017 to 2020, and consecutive specimens received for pathologic diagnosis in public laboratories in 41 hospitals were retrieved.  Results:   In 2020, a total of 455,453 pathologic specimens were received, which amounted to a 15.5% reduction compared with the prior 3-year average (P < .001). An analysis of confirmed malignant pathologic diagnoses revealed a statistically significant reduction in colorectal (-10.0%; P < .001) and prostate (-19.7%; P < .001), nonsignificant reduction in lung (-3.0%; P = .0526), and a marginal but nonsignificant increase for breast (0.7%; P = .7592) regions. Based on time series projection data, the estimated missed cancers for the 3 regions with reduced investigations were colorectal (10.0%), lung (3.0%), and prostate (19.7%).  Conclusions:   Variable impact on actual malignant pathologic diagnoses based on 4 body regions was observed, with a statistically significant reduction in colorectal, lung, and prostate regions, and marginal but insignificant increase in breast regions.

Methods:   We compared a historical control cohort (n = 254; between June 2016 and 2017) that received standardized information about the risk of incontinence after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) with a prospective patient cohort (n = 254; between June 2017 and May 2018) that received individualized information of the chance of recovery of incontinence within 6 months postoperatively based on the continence prediction tool (CPRED). We measured switch in treatment choice, health-related quality of life (QoL) in both cohorts and the accuracy of the CPRED tool.  Results:   Patients in the individualized information group with RARP as initial preference switched more often to another treatment than patients who received standardized information (16% vs. 5%; p = 0.001). Patients in the individualized information group with a high risk of incontinence and with RARP as initial preference switched more often to other treatments than patients in intermediate/low risk of incontinence (35% vs. 9.8%; p = 0.001). Patients with a low risk of incontinence choosing RARP after individualized information were less likely to use more than one diaper a day at any time postoperative (p = 0.001) compared to men with an intermediate/high incontinence risk. Overall QoL was worse in patients with incontinence than patients with continence 6 and 12 months after RARP (respectively; p < 0.0001 and p = 0.007).

Those TAMs are demonstrated to promote chemoresistance and distant metastasis in prostatic cancer through secretion of CCL5. Mechanistically, TAM coculture or additional CCL5 can mediate the STAT3-dependent epithelial-mesenchymal transition process, resulting in distant metastasis in prostatic cancer. Meanwhile, activation of STAT3 induced by CCL5 can mediate upregulation of the transcription factor Nanog, leading to drug resistance.

The utilization of various biological datasets and gene network inference (GNI) algorithms can reveal meaningful gene-gene interactions of GCNs. This study applies three GNI algorithms on mRNA gene expression, RNA-Seq, and miRNA-target genes datasets to infer GCNs of breast and prostate cancers. To evaluate the performance of the GCNs, we utilize overlap analysis via literature data, topological assessment, and Gene Ontology-based biological assessment. The results emphasize how the selection of biological datasets and GNI algorithms affect the performance results on different evaluation criteria. GCNs on microarray gene expression data slightly outperform in overlap analysis. Also, GCNs on RNA-Seq and gene expression datasets follow scale-free topology. The biological assessment results are close to each other on all biological datasets. C3NET algorithm-based GCNs did not contain any biological assessment modules; therefore, it is not optimal for biological assessment. GNI algorithms' selection did not change the overlap analysis and topological assessment results. Our primary objective is to compare the performance results of biological datasets and GNI algorithms based on different evaluation criteria. For this purpose, we developed the GNIAP R package that enables users to select different GNI algorithms to infer GCNs.

Methods:   Using the California Cancer Registry, we conducted a cohort analysis of all insured adults diagnosed between 2009 and 2014 with 8 common cancers (breast, prostate, lung, colon, melanoma, endometrium, kidney, and bladder) and followed them through December 2017.

However, studies can be limited by small sample sizes and sparse clinical follow-up data. We utilized a large sample of prostate specimens to identify a predictive model of biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy and we validated this model in two external data sets.  Methods:   We analyzed prostate specimens from patients undergoing radical prostatectomy at Hartford Hospital between 2008 and 2011. RNA isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded prostates was hybridized to a custom Affymetrix microarray. Regularized (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator [Lasso]) Cox regression was performed with cross-validation to identify a model that incorporated gene expression and clinical factors to predict biochemical recurrence, defined as postoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) > 0.2 ng/ml or receipt of triggered salvage treatment. Model performance was assessed using time-dependent receiver operating curve (ROC) curves and survival plots.  Results:   A total of 606 prostate specimens with gene expression and both pre- and postoperative PSA data were available for analysis. We identified a model that included Gleason grade and stage as well as five genes (CNRIP1, endoplasmic reticulum protein 44 [ERP44], metaxin-2 [MTX2], Ras homolog family member U [RHOU], and OXR1). Using the Lasso method, we determined that the five gene model independently predicted biochemical recurrence better than a model that included Gleason grade and tumor stage alone. The time-dependent ROCAUC for the five gene signature including Gleason grade and tumor stage was 0.868 compared to an AUC of 0.767 when Gleason grade and tumor stage were included alone. Low and high-risk groups displayed significant differences in their recurrence-free survival curves. The predictive model was subsequently validated on two independent data sets identified through the Gene Expression Omnibus. The model included genes (RHOU, MTX2, and ERP44) that have previously been implicated in prostate cancer biology.  Conclusions:   Expression of a small number of genes is associated with an increased risk of biochemical recurrence independent of classical pathological hallmarks.""","""['John P Corradi', 'Christine White Cumarasamy', 'Ilene Staff', 'Joseph Tortora', 'Andrew Salner', 'Tara McLaughlin', 'Joseph Wagner']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Novel Gene Expression Signature Predictive of Clinical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy in Early Stage Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Protein-coding and microRNA biomarkers of recurrence of prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy.', 'Gene signatures predict biochemical recurrence-free survival in primary prostate cancer patients after radical therapy.', 'Early prostate-specific antigen relapse after radical retropubic prostatectomy: prediction on the basis of preoperative and postoperative tumor characteristics.', 'Tissue-Based MicroRNAs as Predictors of Biochemical Recurrence after Radical Prostatectomy: What Can We Learn from Past Studies?', 'A novel lysosome-related gene signature coupled with gleason score for prognosis prediction in prostate cancer.', 'PTEN Protein Phosphatase Activity Is Not Required for Tumour Suppression in the Mouse Prostate.']"""

Yet, a significant number of low-risk PCa patients are over-diagnosed and over-treated with significant and long-term quality of life effects. Further, there is ever increasing evidence of metastasis and higher mortality when hormone-sensitive or castration-resistant PCa tumors are treated indistinctively. Hence, the critical need is to discover clinically-relevant and actionable PCa biomarkers by better understanding the biology of PCa. In this paper, we have discovered novel biomarkers of PCa tumors through cross-cancer learning by leveraging the pathological and molecular similarities in the DNA repair pathways of ovarian, prostate, and breast cancer tumors. Cross-cancer disease learning enriches the study population and identifies genetic/phenotypic commonalities that are important across diseases with pathological and molecular similarities. Our results show that ADIRF, SLC2A5, C3orf86, HSPA1B are among the most significant PCa biomarkers, while MTRNR2L1, EEPD1, TEPP and VN1R2 are jointly important biomarkers across prostate, breast and ovarian cancers.

We aimed to contribute interobserver-intraobserver agreement of 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT, among low/high-experienced interpreters.  Methods:   68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT of 56 patients with prostate cancer were evaluated blindly by four observers. Visual interpretation of malignant disease and SUVmax for lymph node (LN) regions, local tumor, bones and visceral organs were recorded. Cohen's Kappa and Fleiss' Kappa analyses were used to measure agreement between low/high/all-experienced observers. Variations were compared for regions, and the effect of prostate-specific antigen or Gleason score on the results was investigated.  Results:   Interobserver agreement was almost perfect for all LN regions (LN1 low-experienced κ: 0.84/0.84, high-experienced 0.89/0.96; LN2 low-experienced κ: 0.88/0.79, high-experienced 0.95/0.95; LN3 low-experienced κ: 0.84/0.89, high-experienced 0.87/0.94, first/second readings, respectively) and bone lesions (low-experienced κ: 0.88/0.88, high-experienced 0.92/0.92, first/second readings, respectively). For local tumor, interobserver agreement was substantially-almost perfect among a high-experienced group (κ: 0.74/0.89, first/second readings, respectively), and was moderate-substantial among a low-experienced group (κ: 0.62/0.56, first/second readings, respectively). Intraobserver agreement was almost perfect for three observers for all regions and substantial for the observer with the lowest experience in LN3, local and visceral lesions (κ: 0.74/0.79/0.62, respectively).  Conclusion:   Interpretation of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) for prostate cancer is acceptably consistent among observers, but some details are noteworthy. The evaluation should be done more algorithmically for local tumors, since all observers showed relatively lower agreement. The agreement increased as prostate-specific antigen and Gleason score increased. The observer with PSMA experience <30 readings showed lower reliability, distinct from the others.

The manual annotations are operator-dependent, error-prone and time-consuming. The automated segmentation of prostate glands can be very challenging too due to large appearance variation and serious degeneration of these histological structures.  Method:   A new image segmentation method, called RINGS (Rapid IdentificatioN of Glandural Structures), is presented to segment prostate glands in histopathological images. We designed a novel glands segmentation strategy using a multi-channel algorithm that exploits and fuses both traditional and deep learning techniques. Specifically, the proposed approach employs a hybrid segmentation strategy based on stroma detection to accurately detect and delineate the prostate glands contours.  Results:   Automated results are compared with manual annotations and seven state-of-the-art techniques designed for glands segmentation. Being based on stroma segmentation, no performance degradation is observed when segmenting healthy or pathological structures. Our method is able to delineate the prostate gland of the unknown histopathological image with a dice score of 90.16 % and outperforms all the compared state-of-the-art methods.  Conclusions:   To the best of our knowledge, the RINGS algorithm is the first fully automated method capable of maintaining a high sensitivity even in the presence of severe glandular degeneration. The proposed method will help to detect the prostate glands accurately and assist the pathologists to make accurate diagnosis and treatment. The developed model can be used to support prostate cancer diagnosis in polyclinics and community care centres.""","""['Massimo Salvi', 'Martino Bosco', 'Luca Molinaro', 'Alessandro Gambella', 'Mauro Papotti', 'U Rajendra Acharya', 'Filippo Molinari']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Artif Intell Med""","""['Automatic prostate segmentation using deep learning on clinically diverse 3D transrectal ultrasound images.', 'AnatomyNet: Deep learning for fast and fully automated whole-volume segmentation of head and neck anatomy.', 'Fully automatic segmentation on prostate MR images based on cascaded fully convolution network.', 'Automatic Segmentation of Multiple Organs on 3D CT Images by Using Deep Learning Approaches.', 'Pathology Image Analysis Using Segmentation Deep Learning Algorithms.', 'Classifying Malignancy in Prostate Glandular Structures from Biopsy Scans with Deep Learning.', 'Deep learning-based method for segmenting epithelial layer of tubules in histopathological images of testicular tissue.', 'Deep learning-based method for segmenting epithelial layer of tubules in histopathological images of testicular tissue.', 'RAD-UNet: Research on an improved lung nodule semantic segmentation algorithm based on deep learning.', 'Impact of Stain Normalization on Pathologist Assessment of Prostate Cancer: A Comparative Study.']"""

Methods:   Study participants were recruited from 2011 to 2014 at two US institutions. Self-reported urinary and sexual outcomes were measured at baseline before surgery, and 5 weeks, 6 months and 12 months after surgery, using the modified Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-50 (EPIC-50). Changes in EPIC-50 scores from baseline were categorized as improved (beyond baseline), maintained, or impaired (below baseline), using previously-reported minimum clinically important differences.  Results:   Of the 426 eligible participants who completed the baseline survey, 395 provided data on at least one EPIC-50 sub-scale at 5 weeks and 12 months, and were analyzed. Although all mean EPIC-50 scores declined markedly 5 weeks after surgery and then recovered to near (incontinence-related outcomes) or below (sexual outcomes) baseline levels by 12 months post-surgery, some men experienced improvement beyond their baseline levels on each sub-scale (3.3-51% depending on the sub-scale). Having benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) at baseline (prostate size ≥ 40 g; an International Prostate Symptom Index Score ≥ 8; or using BPH medications) was associated with post-surgical improvements in voiding dysfunction-related bother at 5 weeks (OR = 3.9, 95% CI: 2.1-7.2) and 12 months (OR = 3.3, 95% CI: 2.0-5.7); and in sexual bother at 5 weeks (OR = 5.7, 95% CI:1.7-19.3) and 12 months (OR = 3.0, 95% CI: 1.2-7.1).

Although Black men have generally worse prostate cancer outcomes, emerging data suggest that they may experience equivalent outcomes within a fully insured system. In this setting, the authors analyzed treatments and outcomes of non-Hispanic White and Black men in Massachusetts.  Methods:   White and Black men who were 20 years old or older and had been diagnosed with localized intermediate- or high-risk nonmetastatic prostate cancer in 2004-2015 were identified in the Massachusetts Cancer Registry. Adjusted logistic regression models were used to assess predictors of definitive therapy. Adjusted and unadjusted survival models compared cancer-specific mortality. Interaction terms were then used to assess whether the effect of race varied between counties.  Results:   A total of 20,856 men were identified. Of these, 19,287 (92.5%) were White. There were significant county-level differences in the odds of receiving definitive therapy and survival. Survival was worse for those with high-risk cancer (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.50; 95% CI, 1.4-1.60) and those with public insurance (adjusted HR for Medicaid, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.38-2.07; adjusted HR for Medicare, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.14-1.35). Black men were less likely to receive definitive therapy (adjusted odds ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.74-0.83) but had a 17% lower cancer-specific mortality (adjusted HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.7-0.99).  Conclusions:   Despite lower odds of definitive treatment, Black men experience decreased cancer-specific mortality in comparison with White men in Massachusetts. These data support the growing body of research showing that Black men may achieve outcomes equivalent to or even better than those of White men within the context of a well-insured population.  Lay summary:   There is a growing body of evidence showing that the excess risk of death among Black men with prostate cancer may be caused by disparities in access to care, with few or no disparities seen in universally insured health systems such as the Veterans Affairs and US Military Health System. Therefore, the authors sought to assess racial disparities in prostate cancer in Massachusetts, which was the earliest US state to mandate universal insurance coverage (in 2006). Despite lower odds of definitive treatment, Black men with prostate cancer experience reduced cancer-specific mortality in comparison with White men in Massachusetts.

However, the benefit and harm of the increased diagnostic activity have not been quantified in detail for a country or a large region.  Objective:   The aim of this study was to evaluate and quantify the association between increases in diagnostic activity driven by prostate-specific antigen testing and incidence of prostate cancer diagnosis, treatment, and mortality.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cohort study used the Proxy-Based Risk-Stratified Incidence Simulation Model-Prostate Cancer to examine observed data on all Swedish men with prevalent prostate cancer and compare them with a corresponding, hypothetical, simulated scenario with more restrictive diagnostic activity. All men aged 40 to 100 years living in Sweden during the time period 1996 to 2016 with incident and prevalent prostate cancer were included. The second scenario is the corresponding, hypothetical, simulated scenario where diagnostic activity remained constant as of 1996 (the beginning of the prostate-specific antigen testing era) throughout the study period.  Exposures:   High or low diagnostic activity for prostate cancer.  Main outcomes and measures:   Incidence of prostate cancer diagnosis, treatment (deferred treatment, curative treatment, and hormonal treatment), and prostate cancer mortality.  Results:   During the study period from 1996 to 2016, 188 884 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer at a median (interquartile range) age of 71 (64-77) years. Compared with the low-diagnostic activity scenario, in the high-diagnostic activity scenario, the number of men diagnosed with prostate cancer was 48% higher (423 vs 286 [95% CI, 271-302] per 100 000 men per year), 148% more men were diagnosed with low- or intermediate-risk cancer (221 vs 89 [95% CI, 73-105] per 100 000 men per year), and 108% more men received curative treatment (152 vs 73 [95% CI: 66-85] per 100 000 men per year). There were up to 15% fewer prostate cancer deaths in the scenario with high-diagnostic activity (incidence rate ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.82-0.88).  Conclusions and relevance:   This study's results suggest that increased prostate-specific antigen testing and diagnostic activity are associated with a larger number of men being diagnosed with prostate cancer, predominately with low- and intermediate-risk disease. The increased diagnostic activity was associated with a 2-fold increase in curative treatment and a modest decrease in mortality.""","""['Oskar Bergengren', 'Marcus Westerberg', 'Lars Holmberg', 'Pär Stattin', 'Anna Bill-Axelson', 'Hans Garmo']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening and Active Surveillance for High-Risk Individuals.', 'Opportunistic testing versus organized prostate-specific antigen screening: outcome after 18 years in the Göteborg randomized population-based prostate cancer screening trial.', 'Active monitoring, radical prostatectomy and radical radiotherapy in PSA-detected clinically localised prostate cancer: the ProtecT three-arm RCT.', 'Association Between Antidiabetic Medications and Prostate-Specific Antigen Levels and Biopsy Results.', 'Screening for prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force.', 'The relationship between serum albumin and prostate-specific antigen: A analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2003-2010.', 'Diagnostic activity impacts lifetime risk of prostate cancer diagnosis more strongly than life expectancy.']"""

Objectives:   To test the hypothesis that PSAV is associated with clinical progression in patients with low-risk prostate cancer treated with active surveillance and to identify differences between African American and non-Hispanic White patients.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a retrospective population-based cohort study using patient records from the Veterans Heath Administration Informatics and Computing Infrastructure on 5296 patients with a diagnosis of localized prostate cancer from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2015, who were managed with active surveillance. Follow-up extended through March 31, 2020. Low-risk prostate cancer was defined as International Society of Urologic Pathology grade group (GG) 1 clinical tumor stage 2A or lower, PSA level of 10 ng/dL or lower, active surveillance, and no definitive treatment within the first year after diagnosis with at least 1 additional staging biopsy after diagnostic biopsy.  Exposures:   Prostate-specific antigen testing.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcome was GG progression detected after repeated biopsy or prostatectomy, defined as GG2 or higher or GG3 or higher. The secondary outcome was incident metastases. Cumulative incidence functions and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to test associations between PSAV and outcomes.  Results:   The final cohort (n = 5296) included 3919 non-Hispanic White men (74.0%; mean [SD] age, 65.7 [5.8] years) and 1377 African American men (26.0%; mean [SD] age, 62.8 [6.6] years). Compared with African American patients, non-Hispanic White patients were older (mean [SD] age, 65.7 [5.8] years vs 62.8 [6.6] years; P < .001), presented with higher cT stage (stage T2, 608 [15.5%] vs 111 [8.1%]; P < .001), had a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index score (1 and ≥2, 912 [23.3%] vs 273 [19.8%]; P = .002), had higher median income ($60 000 to ≥$100 000, 1223 [31.2%] vs 282 [20.5%]; P < .001), and had a higher median level of education (20% to ≥30% with college degree, 1192 [30.4%] vs 333 [24.2%]; P < .001). Progression to GG2 or higher occurred in 2062 patients (38.9%), with a cumulative incidence of 43.2%, and progression to GG3 or higher occurred in 728 patients (13.7%). Fifty-four patients (1.0%) developed metastases. On multivariable analysis, PSAV was significantly associated with progression to GG2 (hazard ratio, 1.32 [95% CI, 1.26-1.39]), GG3 (hazard ratio, 1.51 [95% CI, 1.41-1.62]), and metastases (hazard ratio, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.10-1.74]). Optimal PSAV thresholds that were associated with progression were significantly lower for African American patients (0.44 ng/mL/y) compared with non-Hispanic White patients (1.18 ng/mL/y).  Conclusions and relevance:   This study suggests that PSAV is significantly associated with grade progression among patients with low-risk prostate cancer managed with active surveillance, but at lower values for African American patients compared with non-Hispanic White patients. These data suggest that serial PSA measures may potentially substitute for multiple prostate biopsies and that African American patients may merit increased frequency of PSA testing.""","""['Tyler J Nelson', 'Juan Javier-DesLoges', 'Rishi Deka', 'P Travis Courtney', 'Vinit Nalawade', 'Loren Mell', 'James Murphy', 'J Kellogg Parsons', 'Brent S Rose']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening and Active Surveillance for High-Risk Individuals.', 'Association Between African American Race and Clinical Outcomes in Men Treated for Low-Risk Prostate Cancer With Active Surveillance.', 'African American Race is Not Associated with Risk of Reclassification during Active Surveillance: Results from the Canary Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance Study.', 'Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Prostate Cancer Outcomes in the Veterans Affairs Health Care System.', 'Active surveillance of prostate cancer in African American men.', 'Prostate-specific antigen concentration in young men: new estimates and review of the literature.', 'Adult- and late-onset male hypogonadism: the clinical practice guidelines of the Italian Society of Andrology and Sexual Medicine (SIAMS) and the Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE).', 'Highly portable quantitative screening test for prostate-specific antigen at point of care.']"""

Objective:   To evaluate whether the association between PSA failure and death may be different in locally advanced vs localized prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   This multicenter cohort study included patients from 2 randomized clinical trials. The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) 95-096 trial randomized 206 men with localized prostate cancer from December 1, 1995, to April 15, 2001, whereas the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 22961 trial randomized 970 men with locally advanced prostate cancer from October 30, 1997, to May 1, 2002. Data were analyzed from January 1, 2020, to October 31, 2020.  Interventions:   The DFCI 95-096 trial randomized men to 0 vs 6 months of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with external beam radiotherapy; the EORTC 22961 trial randomized men to 6 vs 36 months of ADT with external beam radiotherapy.  Main outcomes and measures:   For each trial, the PSA doubling time (time to doubling of PSA levels) associated with PSA failure was evaluated. The risk of all-cause mortality associated with PSA failure (nadir plus 2 definition) was evaluated after adjustment of baseline covariates and treatment.  Results:   This analysis included a total of 1173 men (206 from DFCI 95-096 and 967 with available tumor stage from EORTC 22961; median age, 70.0 [interquartile range (IQR), 65.0-74.0 years). For DFCI 95-096, 161 men died (30 [18.6%] due to prostate cancer) at a median follow-up of 18.2 (IQR, 17.3-18.8) years. Among the 108 men with PSA failure, the median PSA doubling time was 13.0 (IQR, 7.4-31.1) months. For EORTC 22961, 230 men died (75 [32.6%] due to prostate cancer) at a median follow-up of 6.4 (IQR, 6.3-6.6) years. Among 290 men who experienced PSA failure, the median PSA doubling time was 5.0 (IQR, 2.9-8.9) months. Compared with DFCI 95-096, PSA failure was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality in EORTC 22961 (adjusted hazard ratios, 3.98 [95% CI, 2.92-5.44]; P < .001 vs 1.51 [95% CI, 1.03-2.23]; P = .04).  Conclusions and relevance:   The association of PSA failure with outcomes may differ between locally advanced and localized prostate cancer. This finding supports the study of treatment intensification with the use of novel antiandrogen agents in addition to ADT at the time of PSA failure after treatment for locally advanced disease.

Notably, AR signaling is dichotomous, inducing growth at lower activity levels, while suppressing growth at higher levels. Recent clinical studies have exploited this effect by administration of supraphysiological concentrations of T, resulting in clinical responses and improvements in quality of life. However, the use of T as a therapeutic agent in oncology is limited by poor drug-like properties as well as rapid and variable metabolism. Here, we investigated the antitumor effects of selective AR modulators (SARMs), which are small-molecule nonsteroidal AR agonists developed to treat muscle wasting and cachexia. Several orally administered SARMs activated the AR program in PC models. AR cistromes regulated by steroidal androgens and SARMs were superimposable. Coregulatory proteins including HOXB13 and GRHL2 comprised AR complexes assembled by both androgens and SARMs. At bioavailable concentrations, SARMs repressed MYC oncoprotein expression and inhibited the growth of castration-sensitive and castration-resistant PC in vitro and in vivo. These results support further clinical investigation of SARMs for treating advanced PC.""","""['Michael D Nyquist', 'Lisa S Ang', 'Alexandra Corella', 'Ilsa M Coleman', 'Michael P Meers', 'Anthony J Christiani', 'Cordell Pierce', 'Derek H Janssens', 'Hannah E Meade', 'Arnab Bose', 'Lauren Brady', 'Timothy Howard', 'Navonil De Sarkar', 'Sander B Frank', 'Ruth F Dumpit', 'James T Dalton', 'Eva Corey', 'Stephen R Plymate', 'Michael C Haffner', 'Elahe A Mostaghel', 'Peter S Nelson']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Clin Invest""","""['Selective androgen receptor modulators activate the canonical prostate cancer androgen receptor program and repress cancer growth.', 'Urological Oncology: Prostate Cancer.', 'TACC2 is an androgen-responsive cell cycle regulator promoting androgen-mediated and castration-resistant growth of prostate cancer.', 'Dominant-negative androgen receptor inhibition of intracrine androgen-dependent growth of castration-recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) negatively regulate triple-negative breast cancer growth and epithelial:mesenchymal stem cell signaling.', 'Development of selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs).', 'Castration-recurrent prostate cancer is not androgen-independent.', 'Identification and Synthesis of Selected In Vitro Generated Metabolites of the Novel Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator (SARM) 2f.', 'A hotspot for posttranslational modifications on the androgen receptor dimer interface drives pathology and anti-androgen resistance.', 'To block or not to block-hormonal signaling in the treatment of cancers.', 'The testosterone paradox of advanced prostate cancer: mechanistic insights and clinical implications.', 'Androgen Metabolism and Response in Prostate Cancer Anti-Androgen Therapy Resistance.']"""

However, how these early alterations influence subsequent molecular events and the course of the disease over its long natural history remains unclear.METHODSWe explored the molecular and clinical progression of different genomic subtypes of PCa using distinct tumor lineage models based on human genomic and transcriptomic data. We developed transcriptional classifiers, and defined ""early"" and ""late"" categories of molecular subclasses from 8,158 PCa patients. Molecular subclasses were correlated with clinical outcomes and pathologic characteristics using Kaplan-Meier and logistic regression analyses.RESULTSWe identified PTEN and CHD1 alterations as subtype-specific late progression events specifically in ERG-overexpressing (ERG+) and SPOP-mutant tumors, respectively, and 2 distinct progression models consisting of ERG/PTEN (normal to ERG+ to PTEN-deleted) and SPOP/CHD1 (normal to SPOP-mutated to CHD1-deleted) with shared early tumorigenesis but distinct pathways toward progression. We found that within ERG+ and SPOP-mutant subtypes, late events were associated with worse prognosis. Importantly, the clinical and pathologic features associated with distinct late events at radical prostatectomy were strikingly different; PTEN deletions were associated with increased locoregional stage, while CHD1 deletions were only associated with increased grade, despite equivalent metastatic potential.CONCLUSIONThese findings suggest a paradigm in which specific subtypes of PCa follow distinct pathways of progression, at both the molecular and clinical levels. Therefore, the interpretation of common clinical parameters such as locoregional tumor stage may be influenced by the underlying tumor lineage, and potentially influence management decisions.FUNDINGProstate Cancer Foundation, National Cancer Institute, Urology Care Foundation, Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation, US Department of Defense, and the AIRC Foundation.""","""['Deli Liu', 'Michael A Augello', 'Ivana Grbesa', 'Davide Prandi', 'Yang Liu', 'Jonathan E Shoag', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Bruce J Trock', 'Eric A Klein', 'Robert B Den', 'Francesca Demichelis', 'Elai Davicioni', 'Andrea Sboner', 'Christopher E Barbieri']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Clin Invest""","""['SPOP and CHD1 alterations in prostate cancer: Relationship with PTEN loss, tumor grade, perineural infiltration, and PSA recurrence.', 'Collision tumors revealed by prospectively assessing subtype-defining molecular alterations in 904 individual prostate cancer foci.', 'SPOP-Mutated/CHD1-Deleted Lethal Prostate Cancer and Abiraterone Sensitivity.', 'Molecular Subtypes of Prostate Cancer.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Clinical testing of transcriptome-wide expression profiles in high-risk localized and metastatic prostate cancer starting androgen deprivation therapy: an ancillary study of the STAMPEDE abiraterone Phase 3 trial.', 'On data normalization and batch-effect correction for tumor subtyping with microRNA data.', 'The roles of proteases in prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer immunotherapy: a review of recent advancements with novel treatment methods and efficacy.', 'Identification and validation of a poor clinical outcome subtype of primary prostate cancer with Midkine abundance.']"""

Materials and methods:   This multicenter retrospective study included 214 patients with radio-recurrent PCa, treated with SRP between 2007 and 2015. SII was measured preoperatively (neutrophils × platelets/lymphocytes) and the cohort was stratified using optimal cut-off. Uni- and multivariable logistic and Cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate the predictive and prognostic value of SII as a preoperative biomarker.  Results:   A total of 81 patients had high preoperative SII (≥ 730). On multivariable logistic regression modeling, high SII was predictive for lymph node metastases (OR 3.32, 95% CI 1.45-7.90, p = 0.005), and non-organ confined disease (OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.33-4.97, p = 0.005). In preoperative regression analysis, high preoperative SII was an independent prognostic factor for cancer-specific survival (CSS; HR 10.7, 95% CI 1.12-103, p = 0.039) and overall survival (OS; HR 8.57, 95% CI 2.70-27.2, p < 0.001). Similarly, in postoperative multivariable models, SII was associated with worse CSS (HR 22.11, 95% CI 1.23-398.12, p = 0.036) and OS (HR 5.98, 95% CI 1.67-21.44, p = 0.006). Notably, the addition of SII to preoperative reference models improved the C-index for the prognosis of CSS (89.5 vs. 80.5) and OS (85.1 vs 77.1).

However, it is not yet known whether it contributes to the growth and spread of brain cancers especially Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).  Methods:   Here we investigate the expression of MB, and its correlation with the hypoxia markers carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), in human tissue microarrays of multiple organ tumors, brain tumors, and GBM tumors, and their respective cancer-adjacent normal tissues. Correlation between MB protein expression and tumor grade was also assessed.  Results:   We show that MB protein is expressed in a wide variety of cancers, benign tumors, cancer-adjacent normal tissues, hyperplastic tissue samples and normal brain tissue, and low oxygen tensions modulate MB protein expression in different brain cancers, including GBM. Enhanced nuclear LDHA immune-reactivity in GBM was also observed. Finally, we report for the first time a positive correlation between MB expression and brain tumor grade.  Conclusion:   Our data suggest that hypoxia regulate MB expression in different brain cancers (including GBM) and that its expression is associated with a more aggressive phenotype as indicated by the positive correlation with the brain tumor grade.

Additional biomarkers are needed to address this significant clinical problem. Methods: A comprehensive Pubmed search followed by multiplex immunoassays identified candidate biomarkers associated with AG PCa. Subsequently, multiplex and lectin-based immunoassays were applied to a case-control set of sera from subjects with AG PCa, low risk PCa, and non-PCa (biopsy negative). These candidate biomarkers were further evaluated for their ability as panels to complement the prostate health index (phi) in detecting AG PCa. Results: When combined through logistic regression, two panel of biomarkers achieved the best performance: 1) phi, Fuc-PSA, SDC1, and GDF-15 for the detection of AG from low risk PCa and 2) phi, Fuc-PSA, SDC1, and Tie-2 for the detection of AG from low risk PCa and non-PCa, with noticeable improvements in ROC analysis over phi alone (AUCs: 0.942 vs 0.872, and 0.934 vs 0.898, respectively). At a fixed sensitivity of 95%, the panels improved specificity with statistical significance in detecting AG from low risk PCa (76.0% vs 56%, p=0.029), and from low risk PCa and non-PCa (78.2% vs 65.5%, p=0.010).

To better investigate this aspect at the gene level human bladder, brain, lung and prostate cancer cell lines were irradiated with photons (6 Gy, 6 MV LINAC) in hypoxic and normoxic conditions and prepared for the whole genome analysis at 72 h post-irradiation. The analysis was performed on the obtained 20,000 genes per cell line using PCA and hierarchical cluster algorithms to extract the most dominant genes altered by radiation and hypoxia. With the help of the introduced novel radiation-in-hypoxia and oxygen-impact profiles, it was possible to overcome cell line specific gene regulation patterns. Based on that, 37 genes were found to be consistently regulated over all studied cell lines. All DNA-repair related genes were down-regulated after irradiation, independently of the oxygen state. Cell cycle-dependent genes showed up-regulation consistent with an observed change in cell population in the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle after irradiation. Genes behaving oppositely in their regulation behavior when changing the oxygen concentration and being irradiated, were immunoresponse and inflammation related genes.

Methods:   Ninety-three patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer underwent 3-Tesla MRI, including diffusion-weighted imaging (b value = 0, 2000 s/mm2) and radical prostatectomy. Two experienced radiologists, blinded to the clinicopathological data, retrospectively assessed the presence of CA on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI). TCL on T2WI and ADC values were measured on detecting CA in prostate cancer. We used the receiver operating characteristic curves to assess the diagnostic performance of TCL and ADC values for predicting EPE.  Results:   CA was present in 58 prostate cancers among 93 patients. The cut-off value for TCL was 6.9 mm, which yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.75. This corresponded to a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 84.2%, 61.5%, and 69.0%, respectively. The cut-off value for ADC was 0.63 × 10-3 mm2/s, which yielded an AUC of 0.76. This, in turn, corresponded to a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 84.2%, 59.0%, and 67.2%, respectively. The combined cut-off value of TCL and ADC yielded an AUC of 0.82. The specificity (84.6%) and accuracy (81.0%) of the combined value were superior to their individual values (P < 0.05).

Additionally, studies have validated the clinical utility of mpMRI for the detection and localization of CSPCa (Gleason score ≥ 3 + 4). In this study, we sought to develop and compare machine-learning models incorporating mpMRI parameters with traditional logistic regression analysis for prediction of PCa (Gleason score ≥ 3 + 3) and CSPCa on initial biopsy.  Methods:   A total of 688 patients with no prior prostate cancer diagnosis and tPSA ≤ 50 ng/ml, who underwent mpMRI and prostate biopsy were included between 2016 and 2020. We used four supervised machine-learning algorithms in a hypothesis-free manner to build models to predict PCa and CSPCa. The machine-learning models were compared to the logistic regression analysis using AUC, calibration plot, and decision curve analysis.  Results:   The artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) yielded similar diagnostic accuracy with logistic regression, while classification and regression tree (CART, AUC = 0.834 and 0.867) had significantly lower diagnostic accuracy than logistic regression (AUC = 0.894 and 0.917) in prediction of PCa and CSPCa (all P < 0.05). However, the CART illustrated best calibration for PCa (SSR = 0.027) and CSPCa (SSR = 0.033). The ANN, SVM, RF, and LR for PCa had higher net benefit than CART across the threshold probabilities above 5%, and the five models for CSPCa displayed similar net benefit across the threshold probabilities below 40%. The RF (53% and 57%, respectively) and SVM (52% and 55%, respectively) for PCa and CSPCa spared more unnecessary biopsies than logistic regression (35% and 47%, respectively) at 95% sensitivity for detection of CSPCa.  Conclusion:   Machine-learning models (SVM and RF) yielded similar diagnostic accuracy and net benefit, while spared more biopsies at 95% sensitivity for detection of CSPCa, compared with logistic regression. However, no method achieved desired performance. All methods should continue to be explored and used in complementary ways.""","""['Shuanbao Yu#', 'Jin Tao#', 'Biao Dong#', 'Yafeng Fan#', 'Haopeng Du', 'Haotian Deng', 'Jinshan Cui', 'Guodong Hong', 'Xuepei Zhang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['A 4K score/MRI-based nomogram for predicting prostate cancer, clinically significant prostate cancer, and unfavorable prostate cancer.', 'Multivariable Models Incorporating Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Efficiently Predict Results of Prostate Biopsy and Reduce Unnecessary Biopsy.', 'Enhancement of prostate cancer diagnosis by machine learning techniques: an algorithm development and validation study.', 'What Is the Negative Predictive Value of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Excluding Prostate Cancer at Biopsy?

Evaluation was first performed using 2D synthetic shapes to highlight features and pitfalls of the metrics with known ground truths (GTs) and machine segmentations (MSs). Clinical evaluation was then performed using publicly-available prostate images of 20 subjects with MSs generated by 3 different deep learning networks (DenseVNet, HighRes3DNet, and ScaleNet) and GTs drawn by 2 readers. The same readers also performed the 2D visual assessment of the MSs using a dual negative-positive grading of -5 to 5 to reflect over- and under-estimation. Nine metrics that correlated well with visual assessment were selected for further evaluation using 3 different network ranking methods - based on a single metric, normalizing the metric using 2 GTs, and ranking the network based on a metric then averaging, including leave-one-out evaluation. These metrics yielded consistent ranking with HighRes3DNet ranked first then DenseVNet and ScaleNet using all ranking methods. Relative volume difference yielded the best positivity-agreement and correlation with dual visual assessment, and thus is better for providing over- and under-estimation. Interclass Correlation yielded the strongest correlation with the absolute visual assessment (0-5).

To date, a detailed study of the effects of EMT on the frequency-dependent viscoelastic mechanics of the actin cortex is still lacking. In this work, we have used an established atomic force microscope-based method of cell confinement to quantify the rheology of the actin cortex of human breast, lung, and prostate epithelial cells before and after EMT in a frequency range of 0.02-2 Hz. Interestingly, we find for all cell lines opposite EMT-induced changes in interphase and mitosis; whereas the actin cortex softens upon EMT in interphase, the cortex stiffens in mitosis.

We recently report that this translocation activates extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) via PI3Kγ; however, how Gβγ-PI3Kγ activates the ERK1/2 pathway is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that chemokine receptor CXCR4 activates ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1), a small GTPase important for vesicle-mediated membrane trafficking. This activation is blocked by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of the GA-translocating Gγ9 subunit. Inducible targeting of different Gβγ dimers to the GA can directly activate ARF1. CXCR4 activation and constitutive Gβγ recruitment to the GA also enhance ARF1 translocation to the GA. We further demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of PI3Kγ markedly inhibit CXCR4-mediated and Gβγ translocation-mediated ARF1 activation. We also show that depletion of ARF1 by siRNA and CRISPR-Cas9 and inhibition of GA-localized ARF1 activation abolish ERK1/2 activation by CXCR4 and Gβγ translocation to the GA and suppress prostate cancer PC3 cell migration and invasion. Collectively, our data reveal a novel function for Gβγ translocation to the GA to activate ARF1 and identify GA-localized ARF1 as an effector acting downstream of Gβγ-PI3Kγ to spatiotemporally regulate G protein-coupled receptor signaling to mitogen-activated protein kinases.""","""['Mostafa Khater', 'Christian N Bryant', 'Guangyu Wu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Non-canonical Golgi-compartmentalized Gβγ signaling: mechanisms, functions, and therapeutic targets.', 'The olfactory receptor OR51E2 activates ERK1/2 through the Golgi-localized Gβγ-PI3Kγ-ARF1 pathway in prostate cancer cells.', 'G protein βγ translocation to the Golgi apparatus activates MAPK via p110γ-p101 heterodimers.', 'The mechanism and function of mitogen-activated protein kinase activation by ARF1.', 'G-protein βγ subunits as multi-functional scaffolds and transducers in G-protein-coupled receptor signaling.', 'Gβγ signaling regulates microtubule-dependent control of Golgi integrity.', 'Non-canonical Golgi-compartmentalized Gβγ signaling: mechanisms, functions, and therapeutic targets.', 'The olfactory receptor OR51E2 activates ERK1/2 through the Golgi-localized Gβγ-PI3Kγ-ARF1 pathway in prostate cancer cells.', 'Golgi Complex: A Signaling Hub in Cancer.', 'Human C1orf27 protein interacts with α2A-adrenergic receptor and regulates its anterograde transport.']"""

Still, adjacency of organs at risk (OARs) can severely limit RT benefits. Rectal spacer implant in recto-prostatic space provides sufficient separation between prostate and rectum, and therefore, the opportunity for potential dose escalation to the target and reduction of OAR dose. Pretreatment simulation of spacer placement can potentially provide decision support to reduce the risks and increase the efficacy of the spacer placement procedure.  Methods:   A novel finite element method-oriented spacer simulation algorithm, FEMOSSA, was developed in this study. We used the finite element (FE) method to model and predict the deformation of rectum and prostate wall, stemming from hydrogel injection. Ten cases of prostate cancer, which undergone hydrogel placement before the RT treatment, were included in this study. We used the pre-injection organ contours to create the FE model and post-injection spacer location to estimate the distribution of the virtual spacer. Material properties and boundary conditions specific to each patient's anatomy were assigned. The FE analysis was then performed to determine the displacement vectors of regions of interest (ROIs), and the results were validated by comparing the virtually simulated contours with the real post-injection contours. To evaluate the different aspects of our method's performance, we used three different figures of merit: dice similarity coefficient (DSC), nearest neighbor distance (NND), and overlapped volume histogram (OVH). Finally, to demonstrate a potential dosimetric application of FEMOSSA, the predicted rectal dose after virtual spacer placement was compared against the predicted post-injection rectal dose.  Results:   Our simulation showed a realistic deformation of ROIs. The post-simulation (virtual spacer) created the same separation between prostate and rectal wall, as post-injection spacer. The average DSCs for prostate and rectum were 0.87 and 0.74, respectively. Moreover, there was a statistically significant increase in rectal contour similarity coefficient (P < 0.01). Histogram of NNDs showed the same overall shape and a noticeable shift from lower to higher values for both post-simulation and post-injection, indicative of the increase in distance between prostate and rectum. There was less than 2.2- and 2.1-mm averaged difference between the mean and fifth percentile NNDs. The difference between the OVH distances and the corresponding predicted rectal dose was, on average, less than 1 mm and 1.5 Gy, respectively.  Conclusions:   FEMOSSA provides a realistic simulation of the hydrogel injection process that can facilitate spacer placement planning and reduce the associated uncertainties. Consequently, it increases the robustness and success rate of spacer placement procedure that in turn improves prostate cancer RT quality.""","""['Hamed Hooshangnejad', 'Sina Youssefian', 'James K Guest', 'Kai Ding']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Finite Element-Based Personalized Simulation of Duodenal Hydrogel Spacer: Spacer Location Dependent Duodenal Sparing and a Decision Support System for Spacer-Enabled Pancreatic Cancer Radiation Therapy.', 'An overlap-volume-histogram based method for rectal dose prediction and automated treatment planning in the external beam prostate radiotherapy following hydrogel injection.', 'Placement of an absorbable rectal hydrogel spacer in patients undergoing low-dose-rate brachytherapy with palladium-103.', 'Absorbable Hydrogel Spacer Use in Prostate Radiotherapy: A Comprehensive Review of Phase 3 Clinical Trial Published Data.', 'MRI findings of absorbable hydrogel spacer for prostate cancer therapy: a pictorial review.', 'DAART: a deep learning platform for deeply accelerated adaptive radiation therapy for lung cancer.', 'Ultrasound Imaging with Flexible Array Transducer for Pancreatic Cancer Radiation Therapy.', 'deepPERFECT: Novel Deep Learning CT Synthesis Method for Expeditious Pancreatic Cancer Radiotherapy.', 'deepPERFECT: Novel Deep Learning CT Synthesis Method for Expeditious Pancreatic Cancer Radiotherapy.', 'A phantom-based analysis for tracking intra-fraction pancreatic tumor motion by ultrasound imaging during radiation therapy.']"""

Nevertheless, the main chemotherapeutic agent docetaxel came to failure due to chemoresistance. Recently, increasing evidence suggested the importance of tumour microenvironment (TME) in PCa. The present study aimed to explore the specific TME in PCa and find biomarkers related to both immune infiltration and docetaxel. The docetaxel-specific genes and differential expression genes comparing PCa with normal control samples were derived using DESeq2 and zinbwave with GSE140440, TCGA and GTEx datasets. Immune-infiltration-related genes were identified using CIBERSORT and co-expression network analysis. Key genes related to both docetaxel and immune infiltrating in PCa, including nine genes, namely ZNF486, IFI6, TMOD2, HSPA4L, ITPR1, LRRC37A7P, APOC1, APOBEC3G, and ITGA2, were determined by overlapping above three gene sets. ITGA2 was then defined as the hub gene for its significant prognostic implications. Further validations conducted on Oncomine, GEO, TISIDB, MSigDB, and The Human Protein Atlas confirmed the docetaxel-specific and immune infiltrating characteristics of ITGA2. To sum up, our findings could provide a better understanding of immune infiltrating and docetaxel-resistance in PCa, mostly, ITGA2 could serve as potential prognosis biomarkers and targets for the combination of docetaxel.""","""['Yun Peng', 'Shiqiang Dong', 'Zhikai Yang', 'Yuxuan Song', 'Jin Ding', 'Dingkun Hou', 'Lili Wang', 'Zheyu Zhang', 'Nan Li', 'Haitao Wang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Andrologia""","""['Identification of immune-related biomarkers in adrenocortical carcinoma: Immune-related biomarkers for ACC.', 'Exosome-derived miR-27a produced by PSC-27\u202fcells contributes to prostate cancer chemoresistance through p53.', 'Overexpression of SLC6A1 associates with drug resistance and poor prognosis in prostate cancer.', 'Identification of the Key Genes Involved in the Tumorigenesis and Prognosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'Tumour microenvironment and focal therapy for prostate cancer.', 'The Identification of APOBEC3G as a Potential Prognostic Biomarker in Acute Myeloid Leukemia and a Possible Drug Target for Crotonoside.', 'What Do We Have to Know about PD-L1 Expression in Prostate Cancer?

We aimed to identify factors contributing to decisional regret.  Methods:   We conducted a longitudinal study, in which men with lPCa were surveyed at four measurement points: T0 (baseline) = prior to treatment; T1 = 6; T2 = 12; T3 = 18 months after baseline. χ2-tests and independent t-tests were used to compare men undergoing different treatments [Active Surveillance (AS) vs. local treatment]. Logistic regression models were fitted to investigate the associations between predictors (time pressure, information provided by the urologist, impairment of erectile functioning, satisfaction with sexual life) and the criterion decisional regret.  Results:   At baseline, the sample included N = 176 men (AS: n = 100; local treatment: n = 76). At T2 and T3, men after local therapies reported higher regret than men under AS. Decisional regret at T3 was predicted by time pressure at baseline (OR 2.28; CI 1.04-4.99; p < 0.05), erectile dysfunction at T2 and T3 (OR 3.40; CI 1.56-7.42; p < 0.01), and satisfaction with sexual life at T1-T3 (OR 0.44; CI 0.20-0.96; p < 0.05).  Conclusions:   Time pressure, erectile dysfunction, and satisfaction with sexual life predict decisional regret in men with lPCa.

In recent years, Mendelian randomization (MR) has provided complementary information to traditional approaches, but the validity requires that the genetic instrumental variables be causally related to cancers only mediated by the exposure. We summarize and evaluate existing evidence from MR studies in comparison with conventional observational studies to provide insights into the complex relationship between obesity and multiple cancers. MR studies further establish the causality of adult obesity with esophageal adenocarcinoma and cancers of the colorectum, endometrium, ovary, kidney, and pancreas, as well as the inverse association of early life obesity with breast cancer. MR studies, which might account for lifelong adiposity, suggest that the associations in observational studies typically based on single measurement may underestimate the magnitude of the association. For lung cancer, MR studies find a positive association with obesity, supporting that the inverse association observed in some conventional observational studies likely reflects reverse causality (loss of lean body mass before diagnosis) and confounding by smoking. However, MR studies have not had sufficient power for gallbladder cancer, gastric cardia cancer, and multiple myeloma. In addition, more MR studies are needed to explore the effect of obesity at different timepoints on postmenopausal breast cancer and aggressive prostate cancer.""","""['Zhe Fang', 'Mingyang Song', 'Dong Hoon Lee', 'Edward L Giovannucci']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst""","""['Causality Inference of Obesity and Cancer Risk by Mendelian Randomization Analysis: Are We There Yet?', 'Understanding Adiposity at Different Times Across the Life Course and Cancer Risk: Is Evidence Sufficient to Act?', 'Using Mendelian randomization to investigate a possible causal relationship between adiposity and increased bone mineral density at different skeletal sites in children.', 'Mendelian randomization study of adiposity-related traits and risk of breast, ovarian, prostate, lung and colorectal cancer.', 'Causal Associations of Obesity With Achilles Tendinopathy: A Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization Study.', 'The timing of adiposity and changes in the life course on the risk of cancer.', 'Mendelian Randomization as an Approach to Assess Causality Using Observational Data.', 'Obesity, the Adipose Organ and Cancer in Humans: Association or Causation?', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Western Diet-Induced Obesity and Obesity-Related Carcinogenesis-A Narrative Review.', 'Assessment of Body Mass Index, Polygenic Risk Score, and Development of Colorectal Cancer.', 'An ecological study of obesity-related cancer incidence trends in Australia from 1983 to 2017.', 'Examination on the risk factors of cholangiocarcinoma: A Mendelian randomization study.']"""

Using proteomic screens, we found that distinct oncoproteins upregulate IL1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) to suppress anoikis. IL1RAP is directly induced by oncogenic fusions of Ewing sarcoma, a highly metastatic childhood sarcoma. IL1RAP inactivation triggers anoikis and impedes metastatic dissemination of Ewing sarcoma cells. Mechanistically, IL1RAP binds the cell-surface system Xc - transporter to enhance exogenous cystine uptake, thereby replenishing cysteine and the glutathione antioxidant. Under cystine depletion, IL1RAP induces cystathionine gamma lyase (CTH) to activate the transsulfuration pathway for de novo cysteine synthesis. Therefore, IL1RAP maintains cyst(e)ine and glutathione pools, which are vital for redox homeostasis and anoikis resistance. IL1RAP is minimally expressed in pediatric and adult normal tissues, and human anti-IL1RAP antibodies induce potent antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of Ewing sarcoma cells. Therefore, we define IL1RAP as a new cell-surface target in Ewing sarcoma, which is potentially exploitable for immunotherapy. SIGNIFICANCE: Here, we identify cell-surface protein IL1RAP as a key driver of metastasis in Ewing sarcoma, a highly aggressive childhood sarcoma. Minimal expression in pediatric and adult normal tissues nominates IL1RAP as a promising target for immunotherapy.See related commentary by Yoon and DeNicola, p. 2679.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 2659.""","""['Hai-Feng Zhang', 'Christopher S Hughes', 'Wei Li', 'Jian-Zhong He', 'Didier Surdez', 'Amal M El-Naggar', 'Hongwei Cheng', 'Anna Prudova', 'Alberto Delaidelli', 'Gian Luca Negri', 'Xiaojun Li', 'Maj Sofie Ørum-Madsen', 'Michael M Lizardo', 'Htoo Zarni Oo', 'Shane Colborne', 'Taras Shyp', 'Renata Scopim-Ribeiro', 'Colin A Hammond', 'Anne-Chloe Dhez', 'Sofya Langman', 'Jonathan K M Lim', 'Sonia H Y Kung', 'Amy Li', 'Anne Steino', 'Mads Daugaard', 'Seth J Parker', 'Ramon I Klein Geltink', 'Rimas J Orentas', 'Li-Yan Xu', 'Gregg B Morin', 'Olivier Delattre#', 'Dimiter S Dimitrov#', 'Poul H Sorensen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Discov""","""['IL1RAP Pulls a Double Shift in the Cysteine Factory.', 'IL1RAP Pulls a Double Shift in the Cysteine Factory.', 'E-cadherin cell-cell adhesion in ewing tumor cells mediates suppression of anoikis through activation of the ErbB4 tyrosine kinase.', 'The histone demethylase KDM3A, and its downstream target MCAM, promote Ewing Sarcoma cell migration and metastasis.', 'Understanding micrometastatic disease and Anoikis resistance in ewing family of tumors and osteosarcoma.', 'Functional genomics of Ewing sarcoma.', 'Identification and validation of a novel anoikis-related signature for predicting prognosis and immune landscape in ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma.', 'An anoikis-based gene signature for predicting prognosis in malignant pleural mesothelioma and revealing immune infiltration.', 'Anoikis resistance of small airway epithelium is involved in the progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.', 'Identification of anoikis-related molecular patterns to define tumor microenvironment and predict immunotherapy response and prognosis in soft-tissue sarcoma.', 'Construction of anoikis-related lncRNAs risk model: Predicts prognosis and immunotherapy response for gastric adenocarcinoma patients.']"""

Objective:   To evaluate whether addition of docetaxel to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) improved progression-free survival (PFS) in high-risk BCR patients.  Design, setting, and participants:   TAX3503 was a multicenter phase 3 trial that randomized patients with high-risk BCR to ADT for 18 mo ± docetaxel (75 mg/m2 q3w for ten cycles). Eligibility included prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≥1.0 ng/ml after prostatectomy alone or after postoperative radiation therapy, PSA doubling time ≤9 mo, and absence of metastases on computed tomography and bone scintigraphy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary endpoint was PFS following testosterone recovery to noncastrate levels (testosterone >50 ng/dl). Secondary endpoints included time to testosterone recovery, overall survival (OS), quality of life, and safety.  Results and limitations:   Between September 2007 and May 2011, 413 patients were assigned to ADT ± docetaxel. In 2012, following completion of accrual and treatment, the sponsor withdrew support of the study, and in 2013, a registry was created to secure the primary endpoint. The final analysis included data from the original trial and registry. At a median follow-up of 33.6 mo, 260 patients demonstrated testosterone recovery, which occurred similarly between groups. ADT plus docetaxel trended toward a nonclinically meaningful improvement in PFS (median 26.2 vs 24.7 mo) for the testosterone-recovered population (218 events, hazard ratio [HR] 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61-1.04) and in OS for the intention-to-treat population (medians not reached, HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.23-1.10). Grade ≥3 adverse events occurred more frequently in the ADT plus docetaxel group (48.0% vs 10.8%).  Conclusions:   TAX3503 did not demonstrate a meaningful benefit of adding docetaxel to ADT in patients with high-risk BCR. Testosterone recovery was unaffected by addition of docetaxel to ADT.

We determined the safety and efficacy of a selective androgen receptor modulator (OPK-88004) in symptomatic, testosterone-deficient men who had undergone radical prostatectomy for low-grade, organ-confined prostate cancer.  Methods:   In this placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trial, 114 men, ≥19 years of age, who had undergone radical prostatectomy for low-grade, organ-localized prostate cancer, undetectable PSA (<0.1 ng/mL) for ≥2 years after radical prostatectomy and testosterone deficiency were randomized in stages to placebo or 1, 5, or 15 mg OPK-88004 daily for 12 weeks. Outcomes included PSA recurrence, sexual activity, sexual desire, erectile function, body composition, muscle strength and physical function measures, mood, fatigue, and bone markers.  Results:   Participants were on average 67.5 years of age and had severe sexual dysfunction (mean erectile function and sexual desire domain scores 7.3 and 14.6, respectively). No participant experienced PSA recurrence or erythrocytosis. OPK-88004 was associated with a dose-related increase in whole-body (P < 0.001) and appendicular (P < 0.001) lean mass and a significantly greater decrease in percent body fat (P < 0.001) and serum alkaline phosphatase (P < 0.001) than placebo.

Therefore, a sensitive diagnostic marker that is expressed or upregulated exclusively in prostate cancer cells would facilitate diagnostic procedures and ensure a better outcome. We evaluated the expression of myosin 1C isoform A in 5 prostate cell lines, 41 prostate cancer cases, and 11 benign hyperplasias. We analyzed the expression of 12 surface molecules on prostate cancer cells by flow cytometry and analyzed whether high or low myosin 1C isoform A expression could be attributed to a distinct phenotype of prostate cancer cells. Median myosin 1C isoform A expression in prostate cancer samples and cancer cell lines was 2 orders of magnitude higher than in benign prostate hyperplasia. Based on isoform A expression, we could also distinguish clinical stage 2 from clinical stage 3. Among cell lines, PC-3 cells with the highest myosin 1C isoform A level had diminished numbers of CD10/CD13-positive cells and increased numbers of CD29 (integrin β1), CD38, CD54 (ICAM1) positive cells. The surface phenotype of clinical samples was similar to prostate cancer cell lines with high isoform A expression and could be described as CD10-/CD13- with heterogeneous expression of other markers. Both for cell lines and cancer specimens we observed the strong correlation of high myosin 1C isoform A mRNA expression and elevated levels of CD29 and CD54, suggesting a more adhesive phenotype for cells with high isoform A expression. Compared to normal tissue, prostate cancer samples had also reduced numbers of CD24- and CD38-positive cells. Our data suggest that a high level of myosin 1C isoform A is a specific marker both for prostate cancer cells and prostate cancer cell lines. High expression of isoform A is associated with less activated (CD24/CD38 low) and more adhesive (CD29/CD54 high) surface phenotype compared to benign prostate tissue.""","""['Aleena A Saidova', 'Daria M Potashnikova', 'Anna V Tvorogova', 'Oxana V Paklina', 'Evgeniy I Veliev', 'Grigoriy V Knyshinsky', 'Galiya R Setdikova', 'Daniil L Rotin', 'Ivan V Maly', 'Wilma A Hofmann', 'Ivan A Vorobjev']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Selective expression of myosin IC Isoform A in mouse and human cell lines and mouse prostate cancer tissues.', 'Specific and reliable detection of Myosin 1C isoform A by RTqPCR in prostate cancer cells.', 'Expression analysis of osteopontin mRNA splice variants in prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Diagnostic markers of prostate cancer: utility of prostate-specific antigen in diagnosis and staging.', 'Tumor markers.

I analyse interviews with eleven Swedish men, all treated for prostate cancer, and show that such work is done in three ways. Bodily repair work elicits the work men do to restore bodily functions, often through medical technologies. Relational repair work describes how relations with (potential) others shape men's bodily and sexual concerns, and the ways relations redefine such concerns. Age marking as repair emphasises how age is used in the redefinitions of norms about masculinities and aging bodies, both in relation to oneself and others. The analysis highlights how men's repair work is multifaceted, and is performed against the backdrop of dominant discourses on masculinity, medicine and old age.

Accurate detection of extracapsular extension (ECE) of prostate cancer (PCa) is thus crucial for determining appropriate treatment options. We aimed to develop and validate an artificial intelligence (AI)-based tool for detecting ECE of PCa using multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI).  Methods:   Eight hundred and forty nine consecutive PCa patients who underwent mpMRI and prostatectomy without previous radio- or hormonal therapy from two medical centers were retrospectively included. The AI tool was built on a ResNeXt network embedded with a spatial attention map of experts' prior knowledge (PAGNet) from 596 training patients. Model validation was performed in 150 internal and 103 external patients. Performance comparison was made between AI, two experts using a criteria-based ECE grading system, and expert-AI interaction.  Results:   An index PAGNet model using a single-slice image yielded the highest areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.857 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.827-0.884), 0.807 (95% CI, 0.735-0.867), and 0.728 (95% CI, 0.631-0.811) in training, internal, and external validation data, respectively. The performance of two experts (AUC, 0.632 to 0.741 vs 0.715 to 0.857) was lower (paired comparison, all p values < 0.05) than that of AI assessment.

All patients included in the urology surgical waiting list of our high-volume center on May 1st 2020 (46 days after the suspension of elective surgery) were analyzed. Baseline variables, priority on the waiting list, main urological disease, type of scheduled surgery, and waiting time were recorded. Other variables recorded were the presence of a urinary catheter, number of accesses to the emergency department, evidence of COVID-19 infection, number of deaths and their cause. The waiting time for each disease was compared with the time to surgery in 2019.  Results:   A total of 350 patients were included. The mean (SD) time on the waiting list was 97.33 (55.47) days. Priority 1 patients, who normally should undergo surgery within 30 days, were on the waiting list for a mean (SD) time of 60.51 (20.14) days.

Methods: RESIST-PC (NCT03042312) was a prospective multicenter phase 2 trial. Patients with progressive mCRPC after ≥ 1 novel androgen-axis drug, either chemotherapy naïve or postchemotherapy, with sufficient bone marrow reserve, normal kidney function, and sufficient PSMA expression by PSMA PET were eligible. Patients were randomized (1:1) into 2 activity groups (6.0 or 7.4 GBq) and received up to 4 cycles every 8 wk. The primary endpoint was the efficacy of 177Lu-PSMA measured by the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate (RR) after 2 cycles (≥50% decline from baseline). Secondary endpoints included the PSA RR (≥50% decline) at any time (best response), and overall survival (OS). Results: The study was closed at enrollment of 71/200 planned patients because of sponsorship transfer. We report here the efficacy of the University of California Los Angeles cohort results only (n = 43).

There are several risk factors associated with adverse outcomes; however, the value of postoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics is less clear in the ultrasensitive PSA era.  Objective:   To characterize the impact of PSA kinetics on outcomes following SRT and generate nomograms to aid in identifying patients with an increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes.  Design, setting, and participants:   A multi-institutional analysis was conducted of 1005 patients with prostate cancer treated with SRT after RP, with a median follow-up of 5 years.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Variables examined include immediate postoperative PSA, postoperative PSA doubling time (DT), and pre-SRT PSA, in addition to previously identified predictive factors. Multivariable survival analyses were completed using Fine-Gray competing risk regression. Rates of biochemical failure (BF), distant metastasis (DM), and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) were estimated by the cumulative incidence method. Nomograms were generated from multivariable competing risk regression with bootstrap cross-validation.  Results and limitations:   Factors associated with BF after SRT include PSA DT <6 mo, initial postoperative PSA ≥0.2 ng/ml, higher pre-SRT PSA, lack of androgen deprivation therapy, a higher Gleason score (GS), negative margins, seminal vesicle invasion, lack of pelvic nodal radiation, radiation total dose <66 Gy, a longer RP to SRT interval, and older age (p < 0.05 for each). Factors associated with DM include PSA DT <6 mo, pre-SRT PSA, a higher GS, and negative margins. Factors associated with PCSM include PSA DT not calculable or <6 mo and a higher GS. Nomograms were generated to estimate the risks of BF (concordance index [CI] 0.74), DM (CI 0.77), and PCSM (CI 0.77). Limitations include retrospective nature, broad treatment eras, institutional variations, and multiple methods available for the estimation of PSA DT.  Conclusions:   Postoperative PSA kinetics, particularly pre-SRT PSA and PSA DT, are strongly associated with adverse oncologic outcomes following SRT and should be considered in management decisions.  Patient summary:   In this report of men with prostate cancer who developed a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence after prostatectomy, we found that PSA levels after surgery and how quickly a PSA level doubles significantly impact the chance of prostate cancer recurrence after salvage radiation therapy. Based on this information, we created a tool to calculate a man's chance of cancer recurrence after salvage radiation therapy, and these estimations can be used to discuss whether additional treatment with radiation should be considered.""","""['Shauna R Campbell', 'Martin C Tom', 'Shree Agrawal', 'Jason A Efstathiou', 'Jeff M Michalski', 'Matthew C Abramowitz', 'Alan Pollack', 'Daniel E Spratt', 'Jason W D Hearn', 'Kevin L Stephans', 'Tianming Gao', 'Jianbo Li', 'Rahul D Tendulkar']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['Impact of Biochemical Failure After Salvage Radiation Therapy on Prostate Cancer-specific Mortality: Competition Between Age and Time to Biochemical Failure.', 'Ten-Year Outcomes of Moderately Hypofractionated Salvage Postprostatectomy Radiation Therapy and External Validation\xa0of\xa0a\xa0Contemporary Multivariable Nomogram for Biochemical Failure.', 'Larger maximum tumor diameter at radical prostatectomy is associated with increased biochemical failure, metastasis, and death from prostate cancer after salvage radiation for prostate cancer.', 'Use of androgen deprivation and salvage radiation therapy for patients with prostate cancer and biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

French dietary recommendations were updated in 2017, and an adherence score, the Programme National Nutrition Santé Guidelines Score (PNNS-GS2), has been developed and validated using a standardised procedure. The present study aimed to analyse the prospective association between PNNS-GS2 and the risk of death, cancer and CVD. Our sample consisted of French adults included in the prospective NutriNet-Santé cohort (n 67 748, 75 634 and 80 269 for the risk of death, cancer and CVD, respectively). PNNS-GS2 (range: -∞ to 14·25) was calculated from the 24-h dietary records of the first 2 years of monitoring. Association between PNNS-GS2 (in quintiles, Q) and the risk of death, cancer and CVD was studied using Cox models adjusted for the main confounding factors. The sample included 78 % of women, aged on average 44·4 years (sd 14·6) with on average 6·6 (sd 2·3) dietary records. Average PNNS-GS2 was 1·5 (sd 3·4) and median follow-up was 6·6 years for cancers and 6·2 years for CVD and deaths. PNNS-GS2 was significantly associated with the risk of death (hazard ratio (HR)Q5vsQ1: 0·77 (95 % CI 0·60, 1·00), 828 cases), cancer (HRQ5vsQ1 = 0·80 (95 % CI 0·69, 0·92), 2577 cases) and CVD (HRQ5vsQ1 0·64 (95 % CI 0·51, 0·81), 964 cases).

This study characterized how PBT has been used in clinical practice in Korea.  Materials and methods:   Patients who received any type of RT between 2007 and 2019 were identified from the radiation oncology registry of the two PBT facilities operating in Korea (National Cancer Center and Samsung Medical Center). The chi-square test was used to identify patient- and treatment-related characteristics associated with the receipt of PBT.  Results:   A total of 54,035 patients had been treated with some form of RT in the two institutions, of whom 5,398 received PBT (10.0%). The number of patients who receive PBT has gradually increased since PBT first started, from 162 patients in 2007 to 1,304 patients in 2019. Among all types of cancer, PBT use in liver cancer has been steadily increasing from 20% in 2008-2009 to 32% in 2018-2019. In contrast, that in prostate cancer has been continuously decreasing from 20% in 2008-2009 to < 10% in 2018-2019. Male sex, very young or old age, stage I-II disease, residency in non-capital areas, a definitive setting, a curative treatment aim, enrollment in a clinical trial, re-irradiation and insurance coverage were significantly associated with the receipt of PBT (all p < 0.05).  Conclusion:   Since PBT started in Korea, the number of patients receiving PBT has increased to more than 1,000 per year and treatment indications have expanded. Liver cancer is the most common primary tumor among all PBT cases in Korea.""","""['Sung Uk Lee', 'Kyungmi Yang', 'Sung Ho Moon', 'Yang-Gun Suh', 'Gyu Sang Yoo']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Res Treat""","""['A population-based assessment of proton beam therapy utilization in California.', 'Insurance Approval for Proton Beam Therapy and its Impact on Delays in Treatment.', 'Young Adult Populations Face Yet Another Barrier to Care With Insurers: Limited Access to Proton Therapy.', 'Hadrontherapy for cancer.

Methods and materials:   Patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy with a positive finding within the prostate fossa or pelvic nodes on 18F-fluciclovine PET/CTs were identified from the LOCATE patient population. Areas of gross disease were delineated. Prostate fossa contours were delineated using both the 2010 RTOG consensus guidelines and the recently published 2020 GFRU consensus guidelines. Pelvic nodes were contoured with both the 2009 RTOG consensus guidelines and the 2020 NRG consensus guidelines. The performance of the contouring guidelines was assessed by determining what proportion of gross recurrent lesions were encompassed completely or marginally.  Results:   Of the 213 patients within the LOCATE trial, 45 patients were eligible for analysis with positive 18F-fluciclovine PET findings. Of the 30 total prostate fossa recurrences, the 2010 RTOG contour covered 20 (67%) and missed or marginally covered 10 (33%). The 2020 GFRU contour covered 27 recurrences (90%), and missed or marginally covered 3 (10%). Of the 43 total nodal recurrences, the 2009 RTOG pelvic nodal contour covered 29 nodes (67%), and missed or marginally covered 14 (32%). The 2020 NRG pelvic nodal contour covered 43 nodes (100%), with no misses or marginal coverage.  Conclusions:   This secondary analysis of the LOCATE trial exemplifies the improved coverage of the latest prostate fossa contouring recommendations from the GFRU.

Greuter used in traditional medicine""","""Ethnopharmacological relevance:   Dittrichia viscosa (L.) Greuter (""Sarı ot, Yapışkan andız otu"" in Turkish) is a medicinal plant that has been traditionally used in the Mediterranean area. This plant is used by the local population for the treatment of cancer. Investigation of their biological activities is therefore very important to be supported by scientific basis for traditional use.  Aims of the study:   In this study, it is aimed to assess the phytochemical composition, in vitro antioxidant, cytotoxic, and antiproliferative activities of the aqueous and ethanolic extracts obtained from the aerial parts (stems, leaves, flowers) of D. viscosa, collected from two sites in Turkey (Istanbul and Marmaris) against breast and prostate tumor cell lines.  Materials and methods:   Validated methods were used to evaluate the in vitro antioxidant capacity (DPPH, ABTS, CUPRAC), cytotoxicity (Cell Viability Assay), antiproliferative (Apoptosis assay), and phytochemical compositions. The nepetin (N), 3-O-methylquercetin (Q), and hispidulin (H) in the extracts of D. viscosa were quantified by HPLC and LC-HRMS. Furthermore, in order to control the standards of benefiting from the plant in a healthy way, the contents of some heavy metals were also assessed by ICP-OES in the plant and soil samples as well as the species soil's physical and chemical characteristics.  Results:   We have found that heavy metal accumulation in the soil does not exceed the allowable limit value except for the nickel. The results showed that ethanol extraction is an efficient strategy to get NQH molecules with a higher content compared with other extraction techniques. However, using the same extraction method revealed that the amount of NQH molecules in the samples of two different regions were variable. The results suggested that all extracts had a high amount of total phenolic content (12.354-22.184 μg GAE/mg) and total flavonoid content (4.442-17.263 μg QE/g). In the antioxidant assay according to the DPPH method, the aqueous ethanol extracts (IC50; 21.00 μg/mL) showed stronger antioxidant activity than BHT. A significant reduction in cell viability was particularly observed in MDA-MB-231 cells, which were sensitive to ethanolic extracts in Istanbul (12-22%) and in Marmaris (14-15%), while PC3 cell lines were also more sensitive to extracts of the aqueous in Istanbul (16%) and the decoction in Marmaris (12%) after 72 h. Especially, it was observed that Marmaris and Istanbul samples induced the toxicity against PC3 cells.  Conclusion:   The study supports the medicinal use of D. viscosa as a potential anticancer against breast and prostate cancer cells in vitro and underlines the immense therapeutic potential of the plant.""","""['Ece Sevgi', 'Aydan Dag', 'Çağla Kızılarslan-Hançer', 'Sezen Atasoy', 'Belma Zengin Kurt', 'Öznur Aksakal']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Ethnopharmacol""","""['Volatile and phenolic profiling of a traditional medicinal plant, Hypericum empetrifolium with in vitro biological activities.', 'Polarity directed optimization of phytochemical and in vitro biological potential of an indigenous folklore: Quercus dilatata Lindl. ex Royle.', 'Cytotoxic, antioxidant and antibacterial activities of Varthemia iphionoides Boiss. extracts.', 'Phytochemical investigation, in vitro and in vivo antioxidant properties of aqueous and organic extracts of toxic plant: Atractylis gummifera L.', 'Dittrichia&nbsp;graveolens (L.)

End-to-end method for stratifying the patient-level pathological appearance of prostate cancer (PCa) in magnetic resonance (MRI) are of high demand for clinical decision. Existing methods typically employ a statistical method for integrating slice-level results to a patient-level result, which ignores the asymmetric use of ground truth (GT) and overall optimization. Therefore, more domain knowledge (e.g., diagnostic logic of radiologists) needs to be incorporated into the design of the framework. The patient-level GT is necessary to be logically assigned to each slice of a MRI to achieve joint optimization between slice-level analysis and patient-level decision-making. In this paper, we propose a framework (PCa-GGNet-v2) that learns from radiologists to capture signs in a separate two-dimensional (2-D) space of MRI and further associate them for the overall decision, where all steps are optimized jointly in an end-to-end trainable way. In the training phase, patient-level prediction is transferred from weak supervision to supervision with GT. An association route records the attentional slice for reweighting loss of MRI slices and interpretability. We evaluate our method in an in-house multi-center dataset (N = 570) and PROSTATEx (N = 204), which yields five-classification accuracy over 80% and AUC of 0.804 at patient-level respectively.

Methods:   We performed a retrospective study on patients with suspected prostate cancer in the Kunshan Hospital Affiliated with Jiangsu University from January 2017 to December 2019. All of the patients underwent MRI examinations, followed by a systematic biopsy (either alone or in combination with MRI/US fusion-guided targeted biopsy, based on MRI-visible lesions). We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of MRI screening and compared biopsy methods by considering sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) values.  Results:   A total of 157 patients were enrolled, including 112 patients with MRI-visible lesions and 45 patients without MRI-visible lesions. The cancer detection rate (CDR) was higher in patients with MRI-visible lesions (P < 0.001); however, the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) indicators were similar (P > 0.05). The AUC of MRI was 0.63, which was superior to the AUC values of ultrasound (AUC = 0.55, P = 0.031) and digital rectal examination (AUC = 0.52, P = 0.041) for screening prostate cancer. Both overall CDR and clinically significant prostate cancer detection rates were improved if we combined systematic biopsy and MRI/US fusion-guided targeted biopsy procedures.  Conclusion:   Overall, prior MRI screening may serve as a classifier for avoiding the overuse of biopsies. A combination of systematic and MRI/US fusion-guided targeted biopsy procedures offers an optimal regimen for detecting prostate cancer.""","""['Hongqing Yin', 'Jun Shao', 'Huan Song', 'Wei Ding', 'Bin Xu', 'Hui Cao', 'Jianming Wang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['A cohort of transperineal electromagnetically tracked magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasonography fusion-guided biopsy: assessing the impact of inter-reader variability on cancer detection.', 'Accuracy of real-time magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound fusion image-guided transperineal target biopsy with needle tracking with a mechanical position-encoded stepper in detecting significant prostate cancer in biopsy-naïve men.', 'Multicentre evaluation of targeted and systematic biopsies using magnetic resonance and ultrasound image-fusion guided transperineal prostate biopsy in patients with a previous negative biopsy.', 'The value of magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography (MRI/US)-fusion biopsy platforms in prostate cancer detection: a systematic review.', 'Screening and detection advances in magnetic resonance image-guided prostate biopsy.', 'A review of MRI (CT)/US fusion imaging in treatment of breast cancer.']"""

In the present study, the role of the sodium bicarbonate transporters (NBCs) in prostate cancer cell proliferation and viability was examined. qPCR revealed heterogeneous expression of five NBC isoforms in human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, PC3, 22RV1, C4-2, DU145, and the prostate cell line RWPE-1. In fluorescence pH measurement of LNCaP cells, which predominantly express NBCe1, Na+ and HCO3--mediated acid extrusion was identified by bath ion replacement and sensitivity to the NBC inhibitor S0859. NBCe1 knockdown using siRNA oligonucleotides decreased the number of viable cells, and pharmacological inhibition with S0859 (50 µM) resulted in a similar decrease. NBCe1 knockdown and inhibition also increased cell death, but this effect was small and slow. In PC3 cells, which express all NBC isoforms, NBCe1 knockdown decreased viable cell number and increased cell death. The effects of NBCe1 knockdown were comparable to those by S0859, indicating that NBCe1 among NBCs primarily contributes to PC3 cell proliferation and viability. S0859 inhibition also decreased the formation of cell spheres in 3D cultures. Immunohistochemistry of human prostate cancer tissue microarrays revealed NBCe1 localization to the glandular epithelial cells in prostate tissue and robust expression in acinar and duct adenocarcinoma. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that NBCe1 regulates acid extrusion in prostate cancer cells and inhibiting or abolishing this transporter decreases cancer cell proliferation.""","""['Jun Ming Li', 'Soojung Lee', 'Reda Zafar', 'Eunjung Shin', 'Inyeong Choi']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['The electrogenic cardiac sodium bicarbonate co-transporter (NBCe1) contributes to the reperfusion injury.', 'Role of Sodium Bicarbonate Cotransporters in Intracellular pH Regulation and Their Regulatory Mechanisms in Human Submandibular Glands.', 'The Na+/HCO3- co-transporter is protective during ischemia in astrocytes.', 'Structure, function, and regulation of the SLC4 NBCe1 transporter and its role in causing proximal renal tubular acidosis.', 'The electrogenic sodium bicarbonate cotransporter and its roles in the myocardial ischemia-reperfusion induced cardiac diseases.', 'The Role οf Ion Channels in the Development and Progression of Prostate Cancer.']"""

We show that CD4+ T cells of SARS-CoV-2-unexposed patients with hormone-refractory (HR) metastatic PCa had decreased CD4+ T cell immune responses to antigens from SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein but not from the spiked glycoprotein of the 'common cold'-associated human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) as compared with healthy male volunteers who responded comparably to both HCoV-229E- and SARS-CoV-2-derived antigens. Moreover, the HCoV-229E spike glycoprotein antigen-elicited CD4+ T cell immune responses cross-reacted with the SARS-CoV-2 spiked glycoprotein antigens.

Genome-wide association studies have identified more than 170 germline susceptibility loci, but most of them are not associated with aggressive disease. We performed a genome-wide analysis of 185,478 SNPs in Finnish samples (2738 cases, 2400 controls) from the international Collaborative Oncological Gene-Environment Study (iCOGS) to find underlying PrCa risk variants. We identified a total of 21 common, low-penetrance susceptibility loci, including 10 novel variants independently associated with PrCa risk. Novel risk loci were located in the 8q24 (CASC8 rs16902147, OR 1.86, padj = 3.53 × 10-8 and rs58809953, OR 1.71, padj = 4.00 × 10-6; intergenic rs79012498, OR 1.81, padj = 4.26 × 10-8), 17q21 (SP6 rs2074187, OR 1.66, padj = 3.75 × 10-5), 11q13 (rs12795301, OR 1.42, padj = 2.89 × 10-5) and 8p21 (rs995432, OR 1.38, padj = 3.00 × 10-11) regions.

The intronic variant rs2074187 in SP6 was associated not only with overall susceptibility to PrCa (OR 1.66) but also with a higher odds ratio for aggressive PrCa (OR 1.89) and lower odds for non-aggressive PrCa (OR 1.43). Furthermore, the new intergenic variant rs79012498 at 8q24 conferred risk for aggressive PrCa.

We sought to determine the efficacy of adjuvant atorvastatin in prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.  Patients and methods:   In this randomized, double-blind trial, we assigned patients with pathologic high-risk prostate cancer to receive either low-dose atorvastatin (20 mg/day, n = 183) or placebo (n = 181) for 1 year after radical prostatectomy. The primary endpoint was the 1-year biochemical recurrence rate. The secondary endpoints included the 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival and changes in lipid, testosterone, and sex hormone binding globulin levels.  Results:   From October 2012 through January 2019, a total of 364 patients underwent randomization. Among 59 total primary end points, 30 (16.4%) and 29 (16.0%) occurred in the atorvastatin and placebo groups, respectively. Atorvastatin did not significantly reduce the primary endpoint of 1-year biochemical recurrence [HR, 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.58-1.60]. During a median follow-up of 24 months, 131 patients experienced biochemical recurrence (68 in the atorvastatin group and 63 in the placebo group), representing Kaplan-Meier estimated event rates of 24.0% and 25.4% in the atorvastatin and placebo groups, respectively, at 24 months (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.71-1.41). We observed no significant between-group differences in the testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin levels.  Conclusions:   Among patients with high-risk pathologic features after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer, 1-year adjuvant use of atorvastatin was not associated with a lower risk of disease recurrence compared with that for placebo.

Flightless I homolog (FLII) is a coregulator for transcription factors in several malignancies. Here, we have demonstrated that endocrine therapy resistance can induce an immunosuppressive prostate tumor microenvironment and immune evasion through FLII downregulation, which leads to activation of the YBX1/PD-L1 signaling pathway. FLII expression negatively correlated with expression of PD-L1 in tumors. Mechanism studies demonstrated that FLII physically interacted with YBX1 to inhibit nuclear localization of YBX1 and thereby suppress transcription of PDL1 in enzalutamide-resistant tumors. Restoration of FLII expression reversed enzalutamide resistance through activation of T-cell responses in the tumor microenvironment through inhibition of the YBX1/PD-L1 pathway. We also found that reversal of endocrine therapy resistance and immune evasion was mediated by proliferation of effector CD8+ T cells and inhibition of tumor infiltration by regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate a functional and biological interaction between endocrine therapy resistance and immune evasion mediated through the FLII/YBX1/PD-L1 cascade.

AS aims to avoid over treatment in men with low and intermediate-risk PCa and multiple governing bodies have described several AS protocols. This study provides a descriptive profile of the Guy's and St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust (GSTT) AS cohort as a platform for future research in AS pathways in PCa.  Methods:   Demographic and baseline characteristics were retrospectively collected in a database for patients at the GSTT AS clinic with prospective collection of follow-up data from 2012. Seven hundred eighty-eight men being monitored at GSTT with histologically confirmed intermediate-risk PCa, at least 1 follow-up appointment and diagnostic characteristics consistent with AS criteria were included in the profile. Descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariable Cox proportion hazards regression models were used to characterize the cohort.  Discussion:   A relatively large proportion of the cohort includes men of African/Afro-Caribbean descent (22%). More frequent use of magnetic resonance imaging and trans-perineal biopsies at diagnosis was observed among patients diagnosed after 2012. Those who underwent trans-rectal ultrasound diagnostic biopsy received their first surveillance biopsy 20 months earlier than those who underwent trans-perineal diagnostic biopsy. At 3 years, 76.1% men remained treatment free. Predictors of treatment progression included Gleason score 3 + 4 (Hazard ratio (HR): 2.41, 95% Confidence interval (CI): 1.79-3.26) and more than 2 positive cores taken at biopsy (HR: 2.65, CI: 1.94-3.62). A decreased risk of progressing to treatment was seen among men diagnosed after 2012 (HR: 0.72, CI: 0.53-0.98).  Conclusion:   An organised biopsy surveillance approach, via two different AS pathways according to the patient's diagnostic method, can be seen within the GSTT cohort. Risk of patients progressing to treatment has decreased in the period since 2012 compared with the prior period with more than half of the cohort remaining treatment free at 5 years, highlighting that the fundamental aims of AS at GSTT are being met.

To this point, sFLT01 construct was synthesized, recombinant plasmid was expressed in eukaryotic host cells, sFLT01-HisTag protein was extracted and analyzed. The functional activity of sFLT01 on VEGF-enhanced tube formation and angiogenesis of HUVEC cells were examined. Eventually, the inhibitory impact of sFLT01 on growth, invasiveness, and migration of human prostate cancer cell line, DU145, was assessed.

In addition to the planning CT scan, all patients were scanned on a 3 T MR scanner with a 3D double-echo gradient echo (GRE) sequence. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) was performed for marker localization. QSM-derived marker positions were compared to those from CT. The bulk density assignment technique for sCT generation was adopted. The magnitude GRE images were segmented into muscle, bone, fat, and air using a combination of unsupervised intensity-based classification of soft tissue and convolutional neural networks (CNN) for bone segmentation.Results.All implanted markers were visualized and accurately identified (average error: 0.7 ± 0.5 mm). QSM generated distinctive contrast for hemorrhage, calcifications, and gold fiducial markers. The estimated susceptibility/HU values on QSM/CT for gold and calcifications were 31.5 ± 2.9 ppm/1220 ± 100 HU and 14.6 ± 0.9 ppm/440 ± 100 HU, respectively. The intensity-based soft tissue classification resulted in an average Dice score of 0.97 ± 0.02; bone segmentation using CNN resulted in an average Dice score of 0.93 ± 0.03.Conclusion.This work indicates the feasibility of simultaneous fiducial marker identification and sCT generation using a single MRI acquisition.

This study assessed the cumulative incidence of first hospital-based palliative care (HPC) referral, as well as the influence of patient-, tumor-, and care-related factors.  Study design:   This is a retrospective population-based study.  Methods:   The study included patients from the 2014 population-based cancer registry of Gironde, France. International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, coding for palliative care identified HPC referrals from 2014 to 2018. The study included 8424 patients. Analyses considered the competing risk of death and were stratified by initial cancer prognosis (favorable vs unfavorable [if metastatic or progressive cancer]).  Results:   The 4-year incidence of HPC was 16.7% (95% confidence interval, 16.6-16.8). Lung cancer led to more referrals, whereas breast, colorectal, and prostatic locations were associated to less frequent HPC compared with other solid tumors. Favorable prognosis central nervous system tumors and unfavorable prognosis hematological malignancies also showed less HPC. The incidence of HPC was higher in tertiary centers, particularly for older patients. In the favorable prognosis subgroup, older and non-deprived patients received more HPC. In the unfavorable prognosis subgroup, the incidence of HPC was lower in patients who lived in rural areas than those who lived in urban areas.  Conclusions:   One-sixth of cancer patients require HPC. Some factors influencing referral depend on the initial cancer prognosis. Our findings support actions to improve accessibility, especially for deprived patients, people living in rural areas, those with hematological malignancies, and those treated outside tertiary centers. In addition, consideration of age as factor of HPC may allow for improved design of the referral system.""","""['Matthieu Frasca', 'Sébastien Orazio', 'Brice Amadeo', 'Camille Sabathe', 'Emilie Berteaud', 'Angeline Galvin', 'Benoît Burucoa', 'Gaelle Coureau', 'Isabelle Baldi', 'Alain Monnereau', 'Simone Mathoulin-Pelissier']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Public Health""","""['Changes of End of Life Practices for Cancer Patients and Their Association with Hospice Palliative Care Referral over 2009-2014: A Single Institution Study.', 'Use of hospital palliative care according to the place of death and disease one year before death in 2013: a French national observational study.', 'Interval between palliative care referral and death among patients treated at a comprehensive cancer center.', 'Referral Criteria for Outpatient Palliative Cancer Care: A Systematic Review.', 'Palliative care and the hemato-oncological patient: can we live together?

In this study we propose a preoperative and postoperative nomogram to predict postoperative potency recovery following RARP.  Materials and methods:   Patients from development set (6,502) were selected to develop the nomograms, and patients in validation set (2,706) were used for validation. Cox regression models were fitted on the development cohort to predict potency recovery after RARP using as prognostic factors the covariates selected. Two nomograms were drawn using the regression coefficients of the preoperative and postoperative Cox models.  Results:   The discrimination ability of the preoperative model was evaluated on the development cohort using the receiver operator curves estimated at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. The AUC at these time points was 0.726, 0.734, 0.754, and 0.778, respectively. The areas under the curve of the postoperative model at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months were 0.746, 0.756 and 0.777, and 0.801, respectively. Preoperative and postoperative predictive models were validated using a separate set of 2,706 patients. The AUCs of the preoperative model at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months were 0.789, 0.772, 0.768, and 0.778, respectively. The ROC curves of the postoperative model at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months with AUCs of 0.807, 0.797, 0.793 and 0.798, respectively. Along with age and preoperative sexual function, nerve-sparing technique determines the potency outcomes justifying better AUC for postoperative model vs the preoperative model.  Conclusions:   The above nomograms help us to predict with good accuracy the probability of potency recovery within 3, 6, 12 and 24 months following surgery taking into consideration preoperative and postoperative factors.

To this end, cells may need to alter the subcellular localization of crucial proteins. Here, we show that during starvation, VCP, the most abundant soluble ATPase, relocalizes and forms aggregate-like structures at perinuclear regions in PC3 prostate cancer cells. This movement is associated with a lowered metabolic state, in which mitochondrial activity and ROS production are reduced. VCP appears to explicitly sense glutamine levels, as removal of glutamine from complete medium triggered VCP relocalization and its addition to starvation media blunted VCP relocalization. Cells cultured in Gln(+) starvation media exhibited uniformly distributed VCP in the cytoplasm (free VCP) and underwent ferroptotic cell death, which was associated with a decrease in GSH levels. Moreover, the addition of a VCP inhibitor, CB-5083, in starvation media prevented VCP relocalization and triggered ferroptotic cell death. Likewise, expression of GFP-fused VCP proteins, irrespective of ATPase activities, displayed free VCP and triggered cell death during starvation. These results indicate that free VCP is essential for the maintenance of mitochondrial function and that PC3 cells employ a strategy of VCP self-aggregation to suppress mitochondrial activity in order to escape cell death during starvation, a novel VCP-mediated survival mechanism.""","""['Promise Ogor', 'Tomoki Yoshida', 'Masaaki Koike', 'Akira Kakizuka']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Genes Cells""","""['The coordinated action of VCP/p97 and GCN2 regulates cancer cell metabolism and proteostasis during nutrient limitation.', 'Elucidating the contribution of mitochondrial glutathione to ferroptosis in cardiomyocytes.', 'The valosin-containing protein is a novel mediator of mitochondrial respiration and cell survival in the heart in vivo.', 'VCP/p97/Cdc48, A Linking of Protein Homeostasis and Cancer Therapy.', 'Valosin-Containing Protein, a Calcium-Associated ATPase Protein, in Endoplasmic Reticulum and Mitochondrial Function and Its Implications for Diseases.', 'Valosin containing protein (VCP): initiator, modifier, and potential drug target for neurodegenerative diseases.', 'DUSP1 interacts with and dephosphorylates VCP to improve mitochondrial quality control against endotoxemia-induced myocardial dysfunction.', 'Hormone-Glutamine Metabolism: A Critical Regulatory Axis in Endocrine-Related Cancers.', 'mRNA-Modified FUS/NRF2 Signalling Inhibits Ferroptosis and Promotes Prostate Cancer Growth.', 'Insight into the Double-Edged Role of Ferroptosis in Disease.']"""

In this study, we aim to introduce a new immune subtype for PCa involving M2 tumour associated macrophages (M2-TAMs).  Methods:   Three hundred and sixty-two PCa patients and matched normal prostate tissues were selected from the Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus databases. Patients' immune infiltration characters were then analyzed based on the gene expressions. The immune subtypes were identified by the method of unsupervised hierarchical clustering. Finally, the relationship between the M2-TAMs infiltration and anti-programmed death-ligand-1 (PD-L1) therapy was investigated in the IMvigor210 cohort.  Results:   PCa expressed lower immune-related genes levels compared with the adjacent normal tissues. Based on the proved immunosuppressive mechanisms in PCa, tumour patients were classified into three independent subclasses with high infiltrated cytolytic activity (CYT), M2-TAMs and regulatory T cell (Tregs), respectively. Among these subtypes, M2-TAMs infiltration subtype showed the worst clinicopathological features and prognosis compared with the other two subtypes. The results of the IMvigor210 cohort demonstrated poor response of anti-PD-L1 therapy for patients with high M2-TAMs infiltration.  Conclusion:   Prostate tumours involved in significant immunosuppression, and high infiltration of M2-TAMs can be applied to predict the effect of anti-PD-L1 therapy.Key MessagesPCa patients can be classified into three immunotypes of high infiltrated CYT, M2-TAMS, and Tregs according to the immunosuppressive mechanisms.High M2-TAMs infiltration subtype reflected the worst clinical characters, immune infiltration, and lowest expression of immune checkpoint inhibitors among the three subclasses in PCa.High M2-TAMs infiltration predicts the low response rate of anti-PD-L1 therapy.""","""['Zhou JiaWei', 'Dou ChunXia', 'Liu CunDong', 'Liu Yang', 'Yang JianKun', 'Duan HaiFeng', 'Yang Cheng', 'Huang ZhiPeng', 'Wang HongYi', 'Liao DeYing', 'Liang ZhiJian', 'Xie Xiao', 'Zhou QiZhao', 'Xue KangYi', 'Guo WenBing', 'Xia Ming', 'Zhou JunHao', 'Bao JiMing', 'Zhao ShanChao', 'Chen MingKun']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Ann Med""","""['Infiltration and Polarization of Tumor-associated Macrophages Predict Prognosis and Therapeutic Benefit in Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer.', 'Preferential Expression of Programmed Death Ligand 1 Protein in Tumor-Associated Macrophages and Its Potential Role in Immunotherapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Tumor-Associated Macrophages Regulate PD-1/PD-L1 Immunosuppression.', 'PD-L1-Mediated Immunosuppression in Glioblastoma Is Associated With the Infiltration and M2-Polarization of Tumor-Associated Macrophages.', 'Roles of tumor-associated macrophages in anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy for solid cancers.', 'Targeting Wnt/β-catenin signaling using XAV939 nanoparticles in tumor microenvironment-conditioned macrophages promote immunogenicity.', 'Plasma cell subtypes analyzed using artificial intelligence algorithm for predicting biochemical recurrence, immune escape potential, and immunotherapy response of prostate cancer.', 'Tumor microenvironment in non-melanoma skin cancer resistance to photodynamic therapy.', 'The tumor innate immune microenvironment in prostate cancer: an overview of soluble factors and cellular effectors.', 'COL11A1 serves as a biomarker for poor prognosis and correlates with immune infiltration in breast cancer.']"""

Purpose MRI-based risk models following local recalibration were compared with a strategy that combined Prostate Imaging Data and Reporting System (PI-RADS; version 2) and prostate-specific antigen density (PSAd) to assess the potential reduction of unnecessary prostate biopsies. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 385 patients without prostate cancer diagnosis who underwent multipara-metric MRI (PI-RADS category ≥3) and MRI-targeted biopsy between 2015 and 2019. Recalibration and selection of the best-performing MRI model (MRI-European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer [ERSPC], van Leeuwen, Radtke, and Mehralivand models) were undertaken in cohort C1 (n = 242; 2015-2017). The impact on biopsy decisions was compared with an alternative strategy (no biopsy for PI-RADS category 3 plus PSAd < 0.1 ng/mL per milliliter) in cohort C2 (n = 143; 2018-2019). Discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility were assessed by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration plots, and decision curve analysis, respectively. Results The prevalence of csPCa was 38% (93 of 242 patients) and 45% (64 of 143 patients) in cohorts C1 and C2, respectively. Decision curve analysis demonstrated the highest net benefit for the van Leeuwen and Mehralivand models in C1. Used for biopsy decisions in C2, van Leeuwen (AUC, 0.84; 95% CI: 0.77, 0.9) and Mehralivand (AUC, 0.79; 95% CI: 0.72, 0.86) enabled no net benefit at a risk threshold of 10%. Up to a risk threshold of 15%, net benefit remained inferior to the PI-RADS plus PSAd strategy, which avoided biopsy in 63 per 1000 men, without missing csPCa. Without prior recalibration in C1, three of four models (MRIERSPC, Radtke, Mehralivand) were poorly calibrated and not clinically useful in C2. Conclusion The number of unnecessary prostate biopsies in men with positive MRI may be safely reduced by using a prostate-specific antigen density-based strategy. In a risk-averse scenario, this strategy enabled better biopsy decisions compared with MRI-based risk models. ©RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.""","""['Dominik Deniffel', 'Gerard M Healy', 'Xin Dong', 'Sangeet Ghai', 'Emmanuel Salinas-Miranda', 'Neil Fleshner', 'Robert Hamilton', 'Girish Kulkarni', 'Ants Toi', 'Theodorus van der Kwast', 'Alexandre Zlotta', 'Antonio Finelli', 'Nathan Perlis', 'Masoom A Haider']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Radiology""","""['Combined Clinical Parameters and Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Advanced Risk Modeling of Prostate Cancer-Patient-tailored Risk Stratification Can Reduce Unnecessary Biopsies.', 'How to make clinical decisions to avoid unnecessary prostate screening in biopsy-naïve men with PI-RADs v2 score\u2009≤\u20093?', 'Using decision curve analysis to benchmark performance of a magnetic resonance imaging-based deep learning model for prostate cancer risk assessment.', 'Multivariate risk prediction tools including MRI for individualized biopsy decision in prostate cancer diagnosis: current status and future directions.', 'PI-RADS 3 lesions: a critical review and discussion of how to improve management.', 'PI-RADS-Based Segmented Threshold of PSMA-PET SUVmax Is Better than Traditional Fixed Threshold for Diagnosing Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Especially for PI-RADS 3 Lesions.', 'Machine-Learning-Based Tool to Predict Target Prostate Biopsy Outcomes: An Internal Validation Study.', 'mpMRI Interpretation in Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer-An overview of the PRECISE score.', 'PI-RADS: Where Next?', 'Developing a predictive model for clinically significant prostate cancer by combining age, PSA density, and mpMRI.']"""

The objective of this study was to examine longitudinal changes over time in established CV related proteins among men treated with GnRH agonists vs GnRH antagonist.  Materials and methods:   We performed a proteomics analysis of serum samples collected during a phase II randomized study among 80 men with advanced prostate cancer and preexisting CV disease who were randomized to receive a GnRH agonist (39) or GnRH antagonist (41) for 1 year. Serum samples were collected at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months following treatment, and analyzed levels of 188 proteins using the CV panel II and III of the Olink Multiplex platform (Olink Proteomics AB, Uppsala, Sweden). We fitted a linear mixed effects model to assess evidence of a treatment effect across CV related protein values. This included terms for treatment arm, protein levels and time-by-treatment interaction. Results were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method.  Results:   The CV proteomics analysis included 283 samples from 78 subjects. We identified 5 proteins with distinct patterns over time depending on study arm: human chitotriosidase, macrophage receptor with collagenous structure, cathepsin D, superoxide dismutase 2 and hydroxyacid oxidase 1. All 5 are associated with plaque stability and demonstrated an increased level among subjects in the GnRH antagonist arm compared to agonist.  Conclusions:   We compared longitudinal changes in CV proteins among men using androgen deprivation therapy.

However, clinical practice and guidelines differ in their recommendations. We evaluate real-world utilization and practice patterns of IADT.  Materials and methods:   Ontario men ≥65 years of age with PC who initiated ADT for ≥3 months were identified (1997-2017). Lapses in ADT ≥6 months (initial gap) and ≥3 months (subsequent gaps) were used to classify IADT. Neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy was excluded. Disease stage adjustment was completed for patients with likely metastatic disease based on de novo presentation with ADT. Patient and physician predictors of IADT were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression.  Results:   We identified 8,544 patients with 1,715 having previously received local therapy. Among all patients, 16.4% received IADT. This ranged from 11.4%-24.8% across health-planning regions and increased to 26.6% in those with previous local therapy. Mean followup was 8.3 years. Patients with prior local therapy (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.59-2.17, p <0.001) and those in the highest income quintile (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.08-1.60, p=0.005) had increased odds of receiving IADT. Radiation oncologists were more likely to use IADT than urologists (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.59-2.50, p <0.001), as were physicians with more experience (≥10 years in practice: OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.11-1.88, p=0.007). In specialty-stratified analyses, case volume was significantly associated with IADT for radiation oncologists (highest quartile: OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.14-2.62, p=0.009).  Conclusions:   IADT remains underutilized for patients with PC who ≥65 years of age with only 1 in 4 to 1 in 6 eligible patients receiving this form of care.

We evaluated risk factors for UR as well as cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) among patients with UR.  Materials and methods:   We reviewed our institutional radical cystectomy (RC) registry to identify patients with UR. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess risk factors for UR. Kaplan-Meier and Cox models were used to assess the relationship between UR and CSS/OS as well as to compare outcomes following symptomatic vs asymptomatic presentation of UR.  Results:   Overall, 2,930 patients underwent RC from 1980 to 2018, with a median postoperative followup of 7.1 years (IQR 2.8-13.1), of whom 144 (4.9%) were subsequently diagnosed with UR. Carcinoma in situ (HR 1.98, 95% CI 1.30-3.04), multifocal disease (HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.07-2.36) and prostatic urethral involvement at RC (HR 3.01, 95% CI 1.98-4.57) were associated with increased risk of UR. UR was associated with decreased CSS (HR 7.30, 95% CI 5.46-9.76) and OS (HR 1.86, 95% CI 1.54-2.24). A total of 63/144 patients were diagnosed with UR based on symptoms, while 104/144 patients with UR underwent urethrectomy. Patients with symptomatic UR had higher tumor stage at urethrectomy (≥pT2 in 13.1% vs 3.1%, p=0.007), while patients with asymptomatic UR experienced longer median CSS (12.1 vs 6.1 years) and OS (8.30 vs 4.82 years; p=0.05 for both).  Conclusions:   We identified pathological risk factors for UR after RC and report adverse subsequent survival outcomes for these patients. Presentation with symptomatic UR was associated with higher tumor stage and poorer prognosis, supporting a value to continued urethral surveillance after RC.""","""['Abhinav Khanna', 'Andrew Zganjar', 'Timothy Lyon', 'Paras Shah', 'Matthew K Tollefson', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Robert Tarrell', 'Prabin Thapa', 'R Houston Thompson', 'Igor Frank', 'Stephen A Boorjian']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Risk factors and outcomes of urethral recurrence following radical cystectomy.', 'Risk factors and oncological outcomes of urethral recurrence in male patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer after radical cystectomy combined with urinary diversion: a propensity score-matched case control study.', 'Urethrectomy at the time of radical cystectomy for non-metastatic urothelial carcinoma of the bladder: a collaborative multicenter study.', 'Urethral recurrence after radical cystectomy for urothelial carcinoma: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Urethral recurrence after cystectomy: current preventative measures, diagnosis and management.', 'Radical cystectomy and urinary diversion in women: techniques, outcomes, and challenges-a narrative review.', 'Outcomes of patients undergoing concurrent radical cystectomy and nephroureterectomy: A single-institution series.']"""

Recent developments in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis provide an alternative method for noninvasive tumor monitoring at a low cost. Here, we sought to evaluate human Alu and LINE-1 ctDNA for the longitudinal measurement of subcutaneous and intratibial human PCa xenograft growth and response to ionizing radiation (IR) through comparison with standard slide caliper and bioluminescence measurements.  Material and methods:   Intratibial and subcutaneous xenografts were established in male athymic nude mice using LNCaP cells that stably express firefly luciferase. A subset of tumors was treated with a single dose of IR (CT-guided focal IR, 6 Gy). Tumor measurements were simultaneously taken by slide caliper (subcutaneous only), in vivo bioluminescence imaging, and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) of human-specific Alu and LINE-1 ctDNA for several weeks.  Results:   Levels of ctDNA and bioluminescence increased concordantly with subcutaneous and intratibial tumor growth. A statistically significant correlation (Spearman) was observed between ctDNA and subcutaneous tumor volume (LINE-1, r = .94 and Alu, r = .95, p < .0001), ctDNA and bioluminescence (LINE-1, r = .66 and Alu, r = .60, p < .002), and bioluminescence and tumor volume (r = .66, p = .0003). Bioluminescence and ctDNA were also significantly correlated in intratibial tumors (LINE-1, r = .82 and Alu, r = .81, p < .0001). Following external beam IR, the tumor responses varied briefly by method of measurement, but followed a similar trend. Statistically significant correlations were maintained between ctDNA and slide caliper measurement in irradiated subcutaneous tumors (LINE-1, r = .64 and Alu, r = .44, p < .02), and ctDNA and bioluminescence in intratibial tumors (LINE-1, r = .55, p = .018).  Conclusions:   Real-time qPCR of circulating human Alu and LINE-1 DNA provides an accurate measurement of subcutaneous and intratibial xenograft burden that is comparable with conventional bioluminescence imaging and slide caliper measurement. Transient differences in measurements were observed following tumor-targeted IR, but overall all measurements mirrored tumor growth and response.""","""['Alok Mishra', 'Kenji Zennami', 'Esteban Velarde', 'Daniel L J Thorek', 'Srinivasan Yegnasubramanian', 'Theodore L DeWeese', 'Shawn E Lupold']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Optimizing live-animal bioluminescence imaging prediction of tumor burden in human prostate cancer xenograft models in SCID-NSG mice.', 'Conventional in vivo irradiation procedures are insufficient to accurately determine tumor responses to non-uniform radiation fields.', 'Bioluminescent imaging (BLI) to improve and refine traditional murine models of tumor growth and metastasis.', 'In vivo bioluminescence imaging of murine xenograft cancer models with a red-shifted thermostable luciferase.', 'Noninvasive visualization of tumor growth in a human colorectal liver metastases xenograft model using bioluminescence in vivo imaging.', 'Basic Science with Preclinical Models to Investigate and Develop Liquid Biopsy: What Are the Available Data and Is It a Fruitful Approach?', 'ELOVL2 promotes cancer progression by inhibiting cell apoptosis in renal cell carcinoma.']"""

The current multicentre retrospective analysis aims to evaluate the response rate to RLT, the overall survival (OS) of patients and the safety of the treatment according to the extent of bone involvement.  Methods:   The study included patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), who underwent RLT with [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 and a follow-up of at least 6 months. Tumour burden in the bone was classified prior to RLT as follows: less than 6 lesions, 6-20 lesions, more than 20 lesions and diffuse involvement. The response rate was evaluated using changes of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after the first treatment cycle. Overall survival was calculated from the date of the first treatment. Haematological adverse events were classified according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0.  Results:   A total of 319 males were included in the analysis. The extent of bone metastases and PSA response did not correlate significantly. Any PSA decline was observed in 73% patients; 44% showed a decline of ≥50%. The median OS of patient in the different subgroups was 18 months (less than 6 lesions), 13 months (6-20 lesions), 11 months (more than 20 lesions) and 8 months (diffuse involvement), respectively (p < 0.0001). Patients with prior Ra-223-therapy showed longer OS in all subgroups, especially in the subgroups with 6-20 lesions (OS: 16 vs. 12 months; p = 0.038) as well as diffuse involvement (OS: 11 vs. 7 months; p = 0.034). Significant negative prognosticators of OS were the existence of liver metastases in all subgroups and prior chemotherapy in patients with <6 bone lesions. Anaemia and thrombocytopenia correlated positively with the extent of bone metastases: p < 0.0001 and 0.005, respectively. No patient showed a high grade leukopenia.  Conclusion:   The extent of bone involvement correlated negatively with the OS after RLT; however, it showed no relevant correlation with the PSA response rate. Prior therapy with Ra-223 may have a positive impact on OS.

The organic anion polypeptide 1B3 (OATP1B3, encoded by SLCO1B3) transporter has been shown to transport androgens into prostate cancer cells. In this study we observed and investigated the mechanism of induction of SLCO1B3 by abiraterone. Prostate cancer cells (22Rv1, LNCaP, and VCAP) were treated with anti-androgens and assessed for SLCO1B3 expression by qPCR analysis. Abiraterone treatment increased SLCO1B3 expression in 22Rv1 cells in vitro and in the 22Rv1 xenograft model in vivo. MicroRNA profiling of abiraterone-treated 22Rv1 cells was performed using a NanoString nCounter miRNA panel followed by miRNA target prediction. TargetScan and miRanda prediction tools identified hsa-miR-579-3p as binding to the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of the SLCO1B3. Using dual luciferase reporter assays, we verified that hsa-miR-579-3p indeed binds to the SLCO1B3 3'UTR and significantly inhibited SLCO1B3 reporter activity. Treatment with abiraterone significantly downregulated hsa-miR-579-3p, indicating its potential role in upregulating SLCO1B3 expression. In this study, we demonstrated a novel miRNA-mediated mechanism of abiraterone-induced SLCO1B3 expression, a transporter that is also responsible for driving androgen deprivation therapy resistance. Understanding mechanisms of abiraterone resistance mediated via differential miRNA expression will assist in the identification of potential miRNA biomarkers of treatment resistance and the development of future therapeutics.""","""['Roberto H Barbier', 'Edel M McCrea', 'Kristi Y Lee', 'Jonathan D Strope', 'Emily N Risdon', 'Douglas K Price', 'Cindy H Chau', 'William D Figg']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Marked response to cabazitaxel in prostate cancer xenografts expressing androgen receptor variant 7 and reversion of acquired resistance by anti-androgens.', 'Loss of SLCO1B3 drives taxane resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Differential Expression of OATP1B3 Mediates Unconjugated Testosterone Influx.', 'The Emerging Role of the SLCO1B3 Protein in Cancer Resistance.', 'Androgen receptor-related micro RNAs in prostate cancer and their role in antiandrogen drug resistance.', ""Common Genetic Factors and Pathways in Alzheimer's Disease and Ischemic Stroke: Evidences from GWAS."", 'miR579-3p is an inhibitory modulator of neointimal hyperplasia and transcription factors c-MYB and KLF4.', 'Adaptation to Hypoxia May Promote Therapeutic Resistance to Androgen Receptor Inhibition in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.', 'A novel prognostic model based on three clinic-related miRNAs for prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNAs in the Regulation of Solute Carrier Proteins Behind Xenobiotic and Nutrient Transport in Cells.']"""

The hazard ratio for OS, that is, HR(OS), was 0.56 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.29-1.06) with the addition of enzalutamide for all patients with metachronous metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, and for the low-volume subset the HR(OS) was 0.40 (95% CI: 0.16-0.97).

PATIENT SUMMARY: Many men present with prostate cancer that has spread to distant sites beyond the prostate gland years after their initial diagnosis and treatment, while others have distant spread at the time the cancer is diagnosed. On average, men whose cancer comes back years after the initial diagnosis often survive much longer than men whose cancer has been found to spread to distant sites when it is first diagnosed.

Methods:   Patients with UC were enrolled independent of tumor homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status and received rucaparib 600 mg BID. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed objective response rate (RECIST v1.1) in the intent-to-treat and HRD-positive (loss of genome-wide heterozygosity ≥10%) populations. Key secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and safety. Disease control rate (DCR) was defined post-hoc as the proportion of patients with a confirmed complete or partial response (PR), or stable disease lasting ≥16 weeks.  Results:   Of 97 enrolled patients, 20 (20.6%) were HRD-positive, 30 (30.9%) HRD-negative, and 47 (48.5%) HRD-indeterminate. Among 95 evaluable patients, there were no confirmed responses. However, reductions in the sum of target lesions were observed, including 6 (6.3%) patients with unconfirmed PR. DCR was 11.6%; median PFS was 1.8 months (95% CI, 1.6-1.9). No relationship was observed between HRD status and efficacy endpoints. Median treatment duration was 1.8 months (range, 0.1-10.1). Most frequent any-grade treatment-emergent adverse events were asthenia/fatigue (57.7%), nausea (42.3%), and anemia (36.1%). Of 64 patients with data from tumor tissue samples, 10 (15.6%) had a deleterious alteration in a DNA damage repair pathway gene, including four with a deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 alteration.  Conclusions:   Rucaparib did not show significant activity in unselected patients with advanced UC regardless of HRD status.

There is a pressing need to establish novel drug candidates for cancer treatment, though many anticancer agents are available in the market owing to their adverse effects. In recent years, quinazoline and its derivatives have been considered as a novel class of cancer chemotherapeutic agents that show promising activity against different tumors.  Objective:   To evaluate the anti-cancer potential of the novel class of quinazoline tethered acetamide derivatives against six different cancer cell lines.  Methods:   A novel series of various substituted quinazolinone acetamides were synthesized through a feasible scheme. The synthetic scheme involves the conversion of benzoxazinone (from anthranilic acid and benzoyl chloride) intermediate to 3-amino quinazoline-4-one which further converted to the final amide by tethering with the propionyl chloride employing Schotten-Baumann Reaction conditions. All the synthesized derivatives characterized by IR, 1HNMR and MASS spectral methods and anti-cancer activity were evaluated by employing MTT assay for six cancer cell lines and one normal human cell line.  Results:   All the synthesized compounds were screened for anti-cancer activity against six cancer cell lines, including A 549 (lung), DU 145 (prostate), HT 29 (colon), MCF-7 (breast), SiHA (cervical), B16F10 (mouse skin melanoma) and one normal human fibroblast cell lines. All the compounds displayed a decent cytotoxicity profile when compared with the standard drug doxorubicin. Among the synthesized compounds (5a to 5n) tested, two compounds, 5f and 5g have demonstrated excellent cytotoxicity against SiHA and MCF-7 cancer cell lines.  Conclusion:   Comparatively most of the compounds displayed decent cytotoxicity potential relative to the standard drug doxorubicin. Further investigations are needed to establish the detailed mechanism of action of the developed novel quinazolinone acetamides.""","""['Farhana Hakim', 'Roshan Salfi', 'Darna Bhikshapathi', 'Abdullah Khan']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Anticancer Agents Med Chem""","""['Design and Synthesis of Novel Coumarin Conjugated Acetamides as Promising Anticancer Agents: An In Silico and In Vitro Approach.', 'Synthesis and Anticancer Activity of Novel Chromene Derivatives, Chromeno2,3-d1,3Oxazines, and Chromeno2,3-dPyrimidines.', 'Synthesis and anti-proliferative activity of a novel 1,2,3-triazole tethered chalcone acetamide derivatives.', 'Quinazoline and quinazolinone as important medicinal scaffolds: a comparative patent review (2011-2016).', 'Bestowal of Quinazoline Scaffold in Anticancer Drug Discovery.', 'Recent advances and prospects in the organocatalytic synthesis of quinazolinones.']"""

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are common polymorphisms, characterized by a single exchange of nitrogen based in the DNA. This polymorphism is present in the miRs, altering their function.  Objective:   To evaluate the role of SNP rs1834306 of miR100 and rs2910164 of miR146a in the development and prognosis of prostate cancer.  Methods:   One hundred patients diagnosed with prostate cancer and 68 controls were selected. The identification of SNP was rated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction from blood samples, and the analysis was performed within the presence of SNP and the prognostic variables.  Results:   In the SNP rs1834306 (miR100), a smaller presence of the polymorphic homozygous genotype was identified in patients with PSA >10 ng/mL, (P=0.03); when evaluating only the presence of the polymorphic allele G (P=0.09) it was compared to the presence of the wild type allele A. Among the patients with prostate cancer, SNP rs2910164 (miR146A), the polymorphic allele was more frequent in patients with a Gleason score ⩾7 than in patients with a Gleason score <7, (P=0.043). In patients with prostate cancer, miR100 was overexpressed in those with pT3 staging compared to pT2 and among those who had biochemical recurrence (P = 0.004 and P = 0.011, respectively).

Many external beam radiation therapy protocols call for urethral sparing, and with modulated radiotherapy techniques, the radiation dose distribution can be controlled so that maximum doses do not fall within the prostatic urethral volume. Whilst traditional diagnostic MRI sequences provide excellent delineation of the prostate, uncertainty often remains as to the true path of the urethra within the gland. This study aims to assess if a high-resolution isotropic 3D T2 MRI series can reduce inter-observer variability in urethral delineation for radiotherapy planning.  Methods:   Five independent observers contoured the prostatic urethra for ten patients on three data sets; a 2 mm axial CT, a diagnostic 3 mm axial T2 TSE MRI and a 0.9 mm isotropic 3D T2 SPACE MRI. The observers were blinded from each other's contours. A Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) score was calculated using the intersection and union of the five observer contours vs an expert reference contour for each data set.  Results:   The mean DSC of the observer vs reference contours was 0.47 for CT, 0.62 for T2 TSE and 0.78 for T2 SPACE (P < 0.001).

Participants and methods:   ENZA-p (ANZUP 1901) is an open-label, randomized, two-arm, multicentre, phase 2 trial. Participants are randomly assigned (1:1) to treatment with enzalutamide 160 mg daily alone or enzalutamide plus 177 Lu-PSMA-617 7.5 GBq on Days 15 and 57. Two additional 177 Lu-PSMA-617 doses are allowed, informed by Day-92 Gallium-68 (68 Ga)-PSMA positron emission tomography (PET; up to four doses in total). The primary endpoint is prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression-free survival (PFS). Other major endpoints include radiological PFS, PSA response rate, overall survival, health-related quality of life, adverse events and cost-effectiveness. Key eligibility criteria include: biochemical and/or clinical progression; 68 Ga-PSMA PET-avid disease; no prior androgen signalling inhibitor, excepting abiraterone; no prior chemotherapy for mCRPC; and ≥2 high-risk features for early enzalutamide failure. Assessments are 4 weekly during study treatment, then 6 weekly until radiographic progression. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) are used to assess imaging conducted every 12 weeks, 68 Ga-PSMA PET at baseline, Days 15 and 92, and at progression, and 18 F-fluorine deoxyglucose (18 F-FDG) PET at baseline and progression. Translational samples include blood (and optional biopsies) at baseline, Day 92, and first progression. Correlative studies include identification of prognostic and predictive biomarkers from 68 Ga-PSMA and 18 F-FDG PET/CT, circulating tumour cells and circulating tumour DNA. The trial will enrol 160 participants, providing 80% power with a two-sided type-1 error rate of 5% to detect a hazard ratio of 0.625 assuming a median PSA-PFS of 5 months with enzalutamide alone.

Patients and methods:   Forty-one patients (41) with histologically confirmed PCa were scanned using both methods. Planar imaging was performed with additional regional SPECT/CT 3 to 4 hours posttracer injection. Scans were reported as positive, negative, or equivocal. In the case of positive scans, lesions were quantified by each of the 3 reporters separately. Planar and SPECT/CT images were reported together to obtain the final report on each scan.  Results:   Our preliminary results showed no significant difference in the detection of bone metastases between the 2 scans. 99mTc-PSMA detected 52 of the 55 bone lesions detected on 99mTc-MDP. However, 99mTc-PSMA provided extra information by reporting lymph nodal metastases in 7 patients and residual disease in the prostate in 2 patients with biochemical progression after radical therapy.

Cox regression analysis was performed to assess predictors for biochemical progression, including initial PSA value, biopsy Grade Group (GG), T-stage on mpMRI, and lymph node status on PSMA PET imaging (miN0 vs miN1).  Results:   The median (interquartile range) total follow-up of all included patients without biochemical progression was 12.6 (7.5-22.7) months. When assessing biochemical progression after surgery, initial PSA value (per doubling; odds ratio [OR] 1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-1.40; P = 0.004), biopsy GG ≥4 vs GG 1-2 (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.18-2.85; P = 0.007), T-stage on mpMRI (rT3a vs rT2: OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.39-3.27; P = 0.001; ≥rT3b vs rT2: OR 4.78, 95% CI 3.20-7.16; P < 0.001) and miN1 on PSMA PET imaging (OR 2.94, 95% CI 2.02-4.27; P < 0.001) were independent predictors of early biochemical progression of disease.  Conclusion:   Initial PSA value, biopsy GG ≥4, ≥rT3 disease on mpMRI and miN1 disease on PSMA PET were predictors of early biochemical progression after RARP. Identifying these patients with an increased risk of early biochemical progression after surgery may have major implications for patient counselling in radical treatment decisions and on patient selection for modern (neo-)adjuvant and systematic treatments.""","""['Dennie Meijer', 'Pim J van Leeuwen', 'Maarten L Donswijk', 'Thierry N Boellaard', 'Ivo G Schoots', 'Henk G van der Poel', 'Harry N Hendrikse', 'Daniela E Oprea-Lager', 'André N Vis']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Integrating magnetic resonance imaging and prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography results into prostate cancer treatment decision making.', 'Histological comparison between predictive value of preoperative 3-T multiparametric MRI and 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan for pathological outcomes at radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection for prostate cancer.', 'The prognostic value of lymph node staging with prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and extended pelvic lymph node dissection in node-positive patients with prostate cancer.', 'Gallium-68-prostate-specific membrane antigen (68 Ga-PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) predicts complete biochemical response from radical prostatectomy and lymph node dissection in intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'Can Negative Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Avoid the Need for Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection in Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer Patients?

However, there has been a lack of data on its actual impact on the overall survival (OS) of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients. mCRPC is the end stage of prostate cancer, facing a treatment dilemma of overwhelming options; therefore, we hypothesize dynamic MDT discussions can be helpful in comprehensively managing these patients.  Methods:   We retrospectively collected 422 mCRPC patients' clinical information from 2013 to 2020 from our institute. Patients can voluntarily choose whether to enroll in the dynamic MDT group, which includes discussions at CRPC diagnosis and subsequent disease progression. All patients were followed up regularly, and OS from CRPC diagnosis to death was set as the endpoint of this study.  Results:   Participating in MDT discussions is a favorable independent indicator of longer overall survival (median OS: MDT (+): 39.7 months; MDT (-): 27.0 months, hazard ratio: 0.549, p = .001). Moreover, this survival benefit of MDT remained in subgroups with first-line therapy [median OS: MDT (+): not reached; MDT (-): 27.0 months, p = .001) and with multi-line therapy until the end of follow-up (median OS: MDT (+): 36.7 months; MDT (-): 25.6 months, p = .044).  Conclusion:   Therefore, regular MDT discussions are valuable in the management of mCRPC patients. Clinicians are encouraged to tailor MDT discussions dynamically to provide mCRPC patients with a better and more individualized treatment plan and more prolonged survival. Take-home messages ● The MDT model is defined as dynamic MDT discussions at the time of mCRPC diagnosis and each time they progressed later on throughout the disease management. ● Prostate cancer MDT usually includes specialists in urologic oncology, pathology, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, ultrasound, imaging and nuclear medicine. ● MDT model can benefit mCRPC patients in terms of overall survival.""","""['Sha Zhu', 'Junru Chen', 'Yuchao Ni', 'Haoran Zhang', 'Zhenhua Liu', 'Pengfei Shen', 'Guangxi Sun', 'Jiayu Liang', 'Xingming Zhang', 'Zhipeng Wang', 'Qiang Wei', 'Xiang Li', 'Ni Chen', 'Zhiping Li', 'Xin Wang', 'Yali Shen', 'Jin Yao', 'Rui Huang', 'Jiyan Liu', 'Diming Cai', 'Hao Zeng']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Age, Gleason Score, and PSA are important prognostic factors for survival in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

However, it is unclear as to how transition PI-RADS 5 appears on transrectal ultrasound (TRUS).  Purpose:   To assess TRUS features of transition PI-RADS 5 and outcomes of TRUS-guided target biopsy.  Material and methods:   Between March 2014 and November 2018, 186 male patients underwent TRUS-guided biopsy of PI-RADS 5. Of them, 82 and 104were transition and peripheral PI-RADS 5, respectively. Transition and peripheral PI-RADS 5 were compared according to echogenicity (hyperechoic or hypoechoic) and hypoechoic rim (present or absent). Each tumor was targeted with TRUS based on TRUS features. Significant (Gleason score ≥7) and insignificant (Gleason score 6) cancer detection rates (CDRs) were compared between transition and peripheral PI-RADS 5. Standard reference was biopsy examination. Fisher's exact test was used for statistical analysis.  Results:   Transition PI-RADS 5 was hyperechoic in 89.0% (73/82) and had a hypoechoic rim in 97.6% (80/82), whereas peripheral PI-RADS 5 was hypoechoic in 99.0% (103/104) and had a hypoechoic rim in 26.9% (28/104) (both, P<0.0001).

However, the insignificant CDRs of these categories were 22.0% (18/82) and 8.7% (9/104), respectively (P=0.0123).  Conclusion:   Transition PI-RADS 5 tends to have hyperechoic echogenicity and a hypoechoic rim. These findings help to target the transition PI-RADS 5 using TRUS.

These nomograms do not incorporate modern imaging techniques such as prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET).  Objective:   To determine the predictive performance of the Briganti 2017, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), and Briganti 2019 nomograms with the addition of PSMA-PET in an international, multicenter, present-day cohort of patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) and extended pelvic lymph-node dissection (ePLND) for localized PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   All 757 eligible patients who underwent a PSMA-PET prior to RARP and ePLND in three reference centers for PCa surgery between January 2016 and November 2020 were included.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Performance of the three nomograms was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic curve-derived area under the curve (AUC), calibration plots, and decision curve analyses. Subsequently, recalibration and addition of PSMA-PET to the nomograms were performed.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 186/757 patients (25%) had pelvic lymph-node metastatic (pN1) disease on histopathological examination. AUCs of the Briganti 2017, MSKCC, and Briganti 2019 nomograms were 0.70 (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.64-0.77), 0.71 (95% CI: 0.65-0.77), and 0.76 (95% CI: 0.71-0.82), respectively. PSMA-PET findings showed a significant association with pN1 disease when added to the nomograms (p < 0.001). Addition of PSMA-PET substantially improved the discriminative ability of the models yielding cross-validated AUCs of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.70-0.82), 0.77 (95% CI: 0.72-0.83), and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.76-0.87), respectively. In decision curve analyses, the addition of PSMA-PET to the three nomograms resulted in increased net benefits.  Conclusions:   The addition of PSMA-PET to the previously developed nomograms showed substantially improved predictive performance, which suggests that PSMA-PET is a likely future candidate for a modern predictive nomogram.

Methods:   This prospective randomized double-blind pilot study was conducted in the SMS Medical College, Jaipur in collaboration with All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. For morphometric analysis, the number of extracellular vesicles per micrograph were counted under transmission electron microscope.  Results:   Out of 16 patients taken in our study, six were in group 1 (BPH group) and 10 were in group 2 (PCa group).

Methods:   Patients receiving BMA for bone metastases from breast or CRPC were surveyed. Information was collected on patient and disease characteristics, BMA treatments and perceptions regarding BMA benefits and side effects. Interest in participation in trials of de-escalated BMA therapy was also gauged.  Results:   Of 220 patients contacted, 172 eligible patients responded (response rate 78%). Median age was 67 (range: 21-91); 137 (80%) had breast cancer and 35 (20%) CRPC. Symptomatic skeletal events (SSEs) occurred prior to starting BMAs in 61% (84/137) of breast and 48% (17/35) of CRPC patients. Among breast cancer patients, 47, 33 and 13% received zoledronate, pamidronate and denosumab, respectively. Eighty-five percent (30/35) of CRPC patients received denosumab. De-escalation of therapy was more common among breast cancer patients. Although most patients correctly reported the goals of BMA therapy were to ""help stop fractures"" (62%) and ""[improve] quality of life"" (63%), 46.5% felt it prolonged survival and 54% felt it reduced bone progression. Most respondents (102/129, 79%) were comfortable with de-escalating to 6-monthly treatment after 2 years of BMA therapy.

However, practical steps for translating risk predictions to risk-stratified screening policies are not well established. We used a validated population prostate-cancer model to simulate the outcomes of strategies that increase intensity for men at high risk and reduce intensity for men at low risk. We defined risk by the Prompt Prostate Genetic Score (PGS) (Stratify Genomics, San Diego, California), a germline genetic test. We first recalibrated the model to reflect the disease incidence observed within risk strata using data from a large prevention trial where some participants were tested with Prompt PGS. We then simulated risk-stratified strategies in a population with the same risk distribution as the trial and evaluated the cost-effectiveness of risk-stratified screening versus universal (risk-agnostic) screening. Prompt PGS risk-adapted screening was more cost-effective when universal screening was conservative. Risk-stratified strategies improved outcomes at a cost of less than $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year compared with biennial screening starting at age 55 years, but risk stratification was not cost-effective compared with biennial screening starting at age 45.

The present study aimed to investigate the biological function and molecular mechanism of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 2 (PPARG2) in PCA. Our results revealed that PPARG2 was downregulated in PCA, and overexpression of PPARG2 inhibited cell migration, colony formation, invasion and induced cell cycle arrest of PCA cells in vitro. In addition, PPARG2 overexpression modulated the activation of the Akt signaling pathway, as well as inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, mechanistic analysis revealed that PPARG2 overexpression induced increased expression level of miR-200b-3p, which targeted 3' UTR of the downstream targets DNMT3A/3B, and facilitated interaction with demethylated AKAP12 gene promoter and suppressed cell proliferation in PCA.

Methods and materials:   We reviewed the medical records of 386 patients who underwent MRI prior to SRT. We assessed associations of pre-SRT MRI findings with biochemical recurrence (BCR), distant metastasis (DM), prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), and salvage androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) use following SRT. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of MRI for detecting local recurrence were also calculated.  Results:   Pre-SRT MRI was positive for local recurrence in 216 patients (56%), indeterminate in 46 (12%), and negative in 124 (32%). On univariate analysis, BCR following SRT was significantly less likely for patients with positive (HR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.42-0.8) or indeterminate (HR: 0.6: 0.36-1) MRI findings, compared to patients with negative imaging (p = 0.003). These associations remained significant on multivariate analysis (p < 0.05) and across pre-SRT PSA groups. For the entire cohort, the sensitivity of MRI for local recurrence was 61.0% (53.5-68.1%), specificity 60.0% (44.3-73.0%), PPV 86.1% (78.9-91.5%) and NPV 27.6% (19.0-37.5%). Sensitivity of MRI was better in men with higher pre-SRT PSA (80.0% for PSA > 1.0), and specificity was improved with lower pre-SRT PSA (73.9% for PSA 0.1-0.5).

Objective:   To determine if TT levels before and during novel anti-androgen therapies (NAAT), and the TT 'bounce' phenomenon may predict treatment response in CRPC.  Materials and methods:   From 2014 through 2018, we identified 92 CRPC patients treated with either Abiraterone or Enzalutamide from a prospectively maintained cancer registry. The TT levels measured before and during NAAT were correlated with the oncological outcomes, determined by PSA response (% change), PSA progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).  Results and limitations:   At CRPC, 58 (63.0%) and 34 (37.0%) patients opted for Abiraterone and Enzalutamide respectively. Median TT levels at CRPC status before and during NAAT were 10.37 ng/dl and 20.46 ng/dl respectively. PSA response was superior in patients with a higher TT before NAAT (P:0.048, median difference: 18.22%, 95% CI 0.70 - 40.37) and longer time to CRPC (P: 0.041, median difference: 15.31%, 95% CI 1.84 -34.84), with a trend towards lower TT during NAAT (P: 0.062). Over a follow up of 33.0 months, 65 patients (70.7%) developed PSA progression. PSA PFS was longer in patients with higher TT before NAAT (16.3 vs. 10.8 months; P: 0.023), lower TT during NAAT (17.0 vs. 9.1 months; P: 0.001), and longer time to CRPC (13.4 vs. 8.0 months; P: 0.032). Importantly, better OS was observed in lower TT during NAAT (45.0 vs. 33.0 months; P:0.029) and longer time to CRPC (43.0 vs. 31.0 months; P: 0.025). The TT 'bounce' phenomenon was observed in 28 patients (33.3%), and was associated with a poorer PSA response (P: 0.029, median difference: 18.90%, 95% CI 3.83 - 41.45), shorter PSA PFS (8.6 vs 15.2 months, P: 0.002) and shorter OS (29.0 vs. 45.0 months, P: 0.012).

Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of transperineal (TP) prostate biopsy in the outpatient setting under local anesthetic (LA). We demonstrate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of our technique for performing TP biopsy under LA in the clinic setting using a reusable needle guide.  Methods:   A biplanar ultrasound probe with an attached adjustable, reusable needle guide was evaluated for transperineal biopsy. A 17 gauge x 10 cm coaxial needle is attached to the needle guide. The skin is infiltrated, bilaterally, approximately 2 cm anterolateral to the anal verge with 1% lidocaine using a 25 gauge needle. A deeper prostatic block is then performed using a 20 gauge spinal needle. Administration of the anesthetic is delivered to the musculature of the pelvic floor, superficial-to-deep. Prostate samples are obtained using an 18 gauge x 25cm biopsy gun. All biopsies on a side can be obtained utilizing a single perineal skin puncture site. Patients who underwent office TP biopsy after May 2019 also completed a 10-item patient experience questionnaire regarding pain or discomfort experienced during the procedure.  Results:   In 2019, a total of 74 patients underwent office TP prostate biopsy under local anesthesia using a reusable needle guide, while 564 underwent office TRUS biopsy. Prostate biopsy was positive for malignancy in 58.1% of TP patients vs 57.6% in TRUS patients (P = .93). TP biopsy had a lower utilization of prophylactic antibiotics compared to TRUS biopsy: 33.8% vs 99.5% (P < .001), yet there were no admissions, UTI, or sepsis for TP patients, compared to 6 admissions (1.1%) for TRUS biopsy (P = .01)). The mean VAS score ± SD for pain or discomfort caused by the overall office TP biopsy was 3.68 ± 1.96.  Conclusion:   We demonstrate that office TP biopsy under LA with a reusable needle guide can be safely introduced with equivalent cancer detection rates whilst nearly eliminating the risk of urinary sepsis. This was achieved while also significantly reducing the use of prophylactic antibiotics. The procedure was well tolerated, with the most common complaint being local infiltration of anesthetic. We believe that office TP biopsy under LA can be performed with good patient tolerability, as almost 94% of patients were willing to undergo the procedure again.

Decision fatigue may represent an actionable target to reduce low-value urologic care. The objective of this study was to determine whether low-value PSA testing patterns by outpatient clinicians are consistent with decision fatigue.  Methods:   Outpatient appointments for adult men without prostate cancer were identified at a large academic health system from 2011 through 2018. The authors assessed the association of appointment time with the likelihood of PSA testing, stratified by patient age and appropriateness of testing based on clinical guidelines. Appointments included those scheduled between 8:00 am and 4:59 pm, with noon omitted. Urologists were examined separately from other clinicians.  Results:   In 1,581,826 outpatient appointments identified, the median patient age was 54 years (interquartile range, 37-66 years), 1,256,152 participants (79.4%) were White, and 133,693 (8.5%) had family history of prostate cancer. PSA testing would have been appropriate in 36.8% of appointments. Clinicians ordered testing in 3.6% of appropriate appointments and in 1.8% of low-value appointments. Appropriate testing was most likely at 8:00 am (reference group). PSA testing declined through 11:00 am (odds ratio [OR], 0.57; 95% CI, 0.50-0.64) and remained depressed through 4:00 pm (P < .001). Low-value testing was overall less likely (P < .001) and followed a similar trend, declining steadily from 8:00 am (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.42-0.56) through 4:00 pm (P < .001; OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.18-0.30). Testing patterns in urologists were noticeably different.  Conclusions:   Among most clinicians, outpatient PSA testing behaviors appear to be consistent with decision fatigue. These findings establish decision fatigue as a promising, actionable target for reducing wasteful and low-value practices in routine urologic care.  Lay summary:   Decision fatigue causes poorer choices to be made with repetitive decision making. This study used medical records to investigate whether decision fatigue influenced clinicians' likelihood of ordering a low-value screening test (prostate-specific antigen [PSA]) for prostate cancer. In more than 1.5 million outpatient appointments by adult men without prostate cancer, the chances of both appropriate and low-value PSA testing declined as the clinic day progressed, with a larger decline for appropriate testing. Testing patterns in urologists were different from those reported by other clinicians. The authors conclude that outpatient PSA testing behaviors appear to be consistent with decision fatigue among most clinicians, and interventions may reduce wasteful testing and downstream patient harms.""","""['Trevor C Hunt', 'Jacob P Ambrose', 'Benjamin Haaland', 'Kensaku Kawamoto', 'Christopher B Dechet', 'William T Lowrance', 'Heidi A Hanson', ""Brock B O'Neil""]""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Shared decision making in prostate-specific antigen testing: the effect of a mailed patient flyer prior to an annual exam.', ""Factors influencing primary care physicians' decision to order prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test for men without prostate cancer."", ""Clinicians' perceptions of the benefits and harms of prostate and colorectal cancer screening."", 'Screening for prostate cancer.', 'Population screening for prostate cancer and emerging concepts for young men.']"""

However, improved tools to distinguish between low-risk and high-risk cancer are needed in order to select the appropriate treatment.  Purpose:   To investigate the diagnostic potential of signal fractions estimated from a two-component model using combined T2- and diffusion-weighted imaging (T2-DWI).  Material and methods:   62 patients with prostate cancer and 14 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) underwent combined T2-DWI (TE = 55 and 73 ms, b-values = 50 and 700 s/mm2) following clinical suspicion of cancer, providing a set of 4 measurements per voxel. Cancer was confirmed in post-MRI biopsy, and regions of interest (ROIs) were delineated based on radiology reporting. Signal fractions of the slow component (SFslow) of the proposed two-component model were calculated from a model fit with 2 free parameters, and compared to conventional bi- and mono-exponential apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) models.  Results:   All three models showed a significant difference (p<0.0001) between peripheral zone (PZ) tumor and normal tissue ROIs, but not between non-PZ tumor and BPH ROIs. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve distinguishing tumor from prostate voxels was 0.956, 0.949 and 0.949 for the two-component, bi-exponential and mono-exponential models, respectively.

The Gleason score (GS) has been the most widely used grading system for prostate tumor differentiation and represents the best-established prognostic indicator for prostate cancer progression. However, a rapid and sensitive noninvasive diagnostic marker that differentiates GS-based prostate cancer disease progression is needed. As PC is becoming a leading cause of cancer related death for men in the U.S. and worldwide, an immediate need exists for an improved, sensitive, noninvasive, and rapid diagnostic test for PC screening. Here, we employed paper spray ionization-mass spectrometry (PSI MS)-based global metabolomics of urine liquid biopsies to distinguish between healthy (negative for any prostate specific health problems) and progressive PC states (low grade PC such as GS6 and high-grade PC such as GS7, GS8, and GS9). For PSI-MS-based direct untargeted metabolic investigation, a raw urine sample was directly pipetted onto a triangular paper substrate, without any additional sample preparation. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed distinct GS-specific metabolic signatures compared to a healthy control. Variable importance in projection from partial least-squares-discriminant analysis showed distinct metabolic patterns that were correlatively elevated with progressive disease and could serve as biomarkers for diagnosis of prostate cancer risk categorization.""","""['Iqbal Mahmud', 'Frederico G Pinto', 'Vanessa Y Rubio', 'Bongyong Lee', 'Christian P Pavlovich', 'Ranjan J Perera', 'Timothy J Garrett']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['A Novel Urine Exosome Gene Expression Assay to Predict High-grade Prostate Cancer at Initial Biopsy.', 'Data-Driven Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy in Paper Spray Ionization Mass Spectrometry-Based Metabolomics for Rapid Detection of Prostate Cancer.', 'Investigation on core-fucosylated prostate-specific antigen as a refined biomarker for differentiation of benign prostate hyperplasia and prostate cancer of different aggressiveness.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA)-Based Population Screening for Prostate Cancer: An Evidence-Based Analysis.', 'When is prostate cancer really cancer?', 'Mass spectrometry for metabolomics analysis: Applications in neonatal and cancer screening.', 'Distinguishing between Isobaric Ions Using Microdroplet Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry.']"""

To eliminate the effect of cortisone on serum PSA, only patients who were treated without prednisone were included.  Methods:   This IRB-approved retrospective study evaluated 52 patients with mCRPC who were retreated using DOC after first-line DOC (without prednisone in both cases), based on a PSA response of > 50% and no radiographic progression. Twenty-three PSA-based factors, including static and kinetic PSA measures, were evaluate for their ability to predict overall survival (OS) RESULTS: The patients received 688 cycles of DOC in 143 series, including 91 courses of retreatments (1 cycle: 28 patients, 2 cycles: 14 patients, 3 cycles: 8 patients, 4 cycles: 1 patient, and 7 cycles: 1 patient). The median overall number of cycles per patient was 12 (range: 7-31). The median durations of the first, second, and third holidays were 18 weeks (6-60 weeks), 16 weeks (3-44 weeks), and 17 weeks (8-51 weeks), respectively. The median OSs were 22 months (10.5-70 months) after the first DOC treatment and 14 months (3-65 months) after the second DOC treatment. The > 50% PSA decline rate was 48% after retreatment. Short treatment holidays (< 3 months) were associated with shortened OS (p = 0.01). In the multivariate analysis, a 25% PSA increase over the nadir was the strongest predictor of survival (HR: 3.20, 95% CI: 1.47-6.99, p = 0.003).  Conclusions:   DOC retreatment without prednisone had anti-tumor activity in a considerable proportion of mCRPC cases that were initially sensitive to first-line DOC.

Accumulating evidences have proposed that cell motility greatly contributes to the multiple steps of the metastatic process.

In the current study, we first demonstrated that miR-145 exerted inhibitory effects on the aggressive phenotype of the prostate cancer cells. Based on the bioinformatics analysis of the putative target genes of miR-145, we further experimentally identified a novel mechanism of miR-145 suppressing the aggressive phenotype of prostate cancer cells via directly targeting cadherin-2 (CDH2) protein translation. Re-expression of CDH2 could rescue miR-145-triggered cell migration and invasion defects.

Baseline leukocyte count emerged as a stronger predictive factor in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio [HR], 33.94, P = 0.001) relative to osseous TV (HR, 14.24, P = 0.01). After four cycles, 4/32 (12.5%) developed leukocytopenia and the pretherapeutic leukocyte cut-off (HR, 9.97, P = 0.082) tended to predict leukocytopenia better than TV (HR, 8.37, P = 0.109). In addition, a cut-off of 1.33 × 103/mm3 for baseline lymphocytes separated between patients with and without lymphocytopenia (P < 0.001), which was corroborated in multivariate analysis (HR, 21.39, P < 0.001 vs. TV, HR, 4.57, P = 0.03).

Treatments are currently unsatisfactory for advanced prostate cancer. Cancer biology remains the basis for developing new antitumor drugs. Therefore, it is crucial to study the metabolic reprogramming, immune microenvironment, and immune evasion of tumors. This study aimed to clarify the relationship between tumor glycolysis and immune function in prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We downloaded the gene expression matrix and clinical data of prostate cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We studied the expression profiles and prognostic significance of glycolysis-related genes and used CIBERSORT to identify the proportion of tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Through differential gene expression analysis, gene ontology analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis, gene set enrichment analysis, and correlation analysis, we further explored the relationship between glycolytic activity and immune function. We also performed immunohistochemistry, Western blot and RT-qPCR experiments using human prostate cancer tissue and cell lines to verify the expression of some glycolytic genes, macrophage infiltration and polarization.  Results:   Among glycolysis-related genes, the expression of SLC16A3 in prostate cancer tissues was lower than that in normal tissues, but its high expression was associated with poor prognosis. In the high SLC16A3 expression group, several glycolysis-related genes also showed high expression, which was confirmed by immunohistochemistry experiments and Western blot. In high-glycolysis group, the expression of immune-related genes and the interleukin-17 (IL-17) signaling pathway were upregulated. CD8+ T cells, regulatory T cells, macrophages, and other immune cells were highly enriched. Among them, M2 macrophage infiltration was associated with poor prognosis.  Conclusion:   The enhanced glycolytic activity of prostate cancer may contribute to the formation of a pro-tumor immune microenvironment.

We compare cancer incidence rates, cancer-specific mortality rates, and cancer case-fatality ratios in US astronauts with those in the US general population.  Methods:   We use standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) and standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) to index the incidence and mortality of various cancers against rates in the US general population, from the US astronaut cohort inception in April 1959 through 31 December 2017. We compare the lethality of these cancers using the relative case-fatality ratio.  Results:   Overall cancer incidence and mortality were slightly lower than expected from national rates with SIR 82 (95% CI 63 to 104) and SMR 72 (95% CI 44 to 111) with a modest 14% reduction in case-fatality ratio. Prostate cancer and melanoma skin cancer had significant increases in incidence, with SIR of 162 (95% CI 109 to 232) and 252 (95% CI 126 to 452), respectively, though only melanoma had a significant increase in mortality, with SMR 508 (95% CI 105 to 1485). Lung cancer had a significant deficit of both cases and deaths, while colon cancer had sizeable (but not significant) reductions in incidence and mortality.  Conclusions:   The increase in incidence of melanoma is consistent with that observed in aircraft pilots, suggesting this may be associated with ultraviolet radiation or lifestyle factors rather than any astronaut-specific exposure. Reductions in lung cancer incidence and mortality, and trends towards such reductions in colon cancer, may be explained in part by healthy lifestyle, as well as differential screening among astronauts.""","""['Robert Reynolds', 'Mark P Little', 'Steven Day', 'Jacqueline Charvat', 'Steven Blattnig', 'Janice Huff', 'Zarana S Patel']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Occup Environ Med""","""['Mortality among U.S. astronauts: 1980-2009.', 'Cohort study of Air Canada pilots: mortality, cancer incidence, and leukemia risk.', 'Workplace risk factors for cancer in the German rubber industry: Part 2.

Biologically active glucocorticoids that stimulate glucocorticoid receptor (GR) have an 11β-OH moiety, and resistant tumors exhibit loss of 11β-HSD2, the oxidative (11β-OH → 11-keto) enzyme that normally inactivates glucocorticoids, allowing elevated tumor glucocorticoids to drive resistance by stimulating GR. Here, we show that up-regulation of hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PD) protein occurs in prostate cancer tissues of men treated with enzalutamide, human-derived cell lines, and patient-derived prostate tissues treated ex vivo with enzalutamide. Genetically silencing H6PD blocks NADPH generation, which inhibits the usual reductive directionality of 11β-HSD1, to effectively replace 11β-HSD2 function in human-derived cell line models, suppress the concentration of biologically active glucocorticoids in prostate cancer, and reverse enzalutamide resistance in mouse xenograft models. Similarly, pharmacologic blockade of H6PD with rucaparib normalizes tumor glucocorticoid metabolism in human cell lines and reinstates responsiveness to enzalutamide in mouse xenograft models. Our data show that blockade of H6PD, which is essential for glucocorticoid synthesis in humans, normalizes glucocorticoid metabolism and reverses enzalutamide resistance in mouse xenograft models.

Because the composition of the gut microbiota is known to change with dietary composition and body type, we used prostate-specific Pten knockout mice as a prostate cancer model to investigate whether there is a gut microbiota-mediated connection between animal fat intake and prostate cancer. Oral administration of an antibiotic mixture (Abx) in prostate cancer-bearing mice fed a high-fat diet containing a large proportion of lard drastically altered the composition of the gut microbiota including Rikenellaceae and Clostridiales, inhibited prostate cancer cell proliferation, and reduced prostate Igf1 expression and circulating insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) levels. In prostate cancer tissue, MAPK and PI3K activities, both downstream of the IGF1 receptor, were suppressed by Abx administration. IGF1 directly promoted the proliferation of prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and 22Rv1 in vitro. Abx administration also reduced fecal levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) produced by intestinal bacteria. Supplementation with SCFAs promoted tumor growth by increasing IGF1 levels. In humans, IGF1 was found to be highly expressed in prostate cancer tissue from obese patients. In conclusion, IGF1 production stimulated by SCFAs from gut microbes influences the growth of prostate cancer via activating local prostate MAPK and PI3K signaling, indicating the existence of a gut microbiota-IGF1-prostate axis. Disrupting this axis by modulating the gut microbiota may aid in prostate cancer prevention and treatment. SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that intestinal bacteria, acting through short-chain fatty acids, regulate systemic and local prostate IGF1 in the host, which can promote proliferation of prostate cancer cells.""","""['Makoto Matsushita', 'Kazutoshi Fujita', 'Takuji Hayashi', 'Hisako Kayama', 'Daisuke Motooka', 'Hiroaki Hase', 'Kentaro Jingushi', 'Gaku Yamamichi', 'Satoru Yumiba', 'Eisuke Tomiyama', 'Yoko Koh', 'Yujiro Hayashi', 'Kosuke Nakano', 'Cong Wang', 'Yu Ishizuya', 'Taigo Kato', 'Koji Hatano', 'Atsunari Kawashima', 'Takeshi Ujike', 'Motohide Uemura', 'Ryoichi Imamura', 'Maria D C Rodriguez Pena', 'Jennifer B Gordetsky', 'George J Netto', 'Kazutake Tsujikawa', 'Shota Nakamura', 'Kiyoshi Takeda', 'Norio Nonomura']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Coix seed polysaccharides alleviate type 2 diabetes mellitus via gut microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids activation of IGF1/PI3K/AKT signaling.', 'Correlation between microbes and colorectal cancer: tumor apoptosis is induced by sitosterols through promoting gut microbiota to produce short-chain fatty acids.', 'Short-chain fatty acids: microbial metabolites that alleviate stress-induced brain-gut axis alterations.', 'Gut microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids and colorectal cancer: Ready for clinical translation?', 'Gut Microbiota-Derived Short-Chain Fatty Acids Facilitate Microbiota:Host Cross talk and Modulate Obesity and Hypertension.', 'Breast cancers as ecosystems: a metabolic perspective.', 'The potential role of the microbiota in prostate cancer pathogenesis and treatment.', 'Lactate as Key Metabolite in Prostate Cancer Progression: What Are the Clinical Implications?', 'Bacteria in cancer initiation, promotion and progression.', 'FFAR2 antagonizes TLR2- and TLR3-induced lung cancer progression via the inhibition of AMPK-TAK1 signaling axis for the activation of NF-κB.']"""

Therefore, this study examined the effect of the pre-operative internal obturator muscle (IOM) mass index on biochemical recurrence (BCR) of prostate cancer (PCa) patients who underwent radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   In total, 222 patients, who underwent open, laparoscopic, or robot-assisted radical prostatectomy at seven centers in 2011 and were followed up for 5 years, were enrolled. BCR was examined in the context of pre-operative IOM mass index and BMI.  Results:   The mean age of the patients was 67.82 ± 6.23 years, and the mean pre-operative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 11.61 ± 13.22 ng/ml. There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics between the low and high IOM mass index groups (p > 0.05). Age, pre-op PSA level, ECE, and T-stage were associated with BCR (p = 0.049, p < 0.001, p = 0.001, p = 0.004, respectively). BMI, prostate volume, Gleason score, resection margin, N-stage, M-stage and IOM mass index was not associated with BCR (p > 0.05).

Patients and methods:   We identified 332 men with a positive mpMRI (single lesion with PI-RADS ≥3) who underwent systematic plus targeted biopsy and subsequent RP at two tertiary referral centres between 2013 and 2018. All mpMRIs were reviewed by experienced radiologists using PI-RADS scores. The study outcome was to assess the relationship between MRIvol (based on planimetry from MRI sequence best showing tumour) and RPvol (based on tumour involved area of each RP pathology slice). To achieve this endpoint, we performed a multivariable linear regression analysis (LRA) to predict RPvol using PI-RADS, prostate-specific antigen level, prostate volume, age, digital rectal examination, Gleason score at MRI-targeted biopsy, biopsy history and time from mpMRI to RP as covariates. Non-parametric locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) function was used to graphically explore the relationship between MRIvol and RPvol, stratifying for PI-RADS score.  Results:   Overall, 24%, 49% and 27% of men had visible PI-RADS 3, 4 and 5 lesions at mpMRI. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) MRIvol and RPvol were 0.67 (0.29-1.76) mL and 1.39 (0.58-4.23) mL. At LRA, MRIvol was significantly correlated with a RPvol underestimation (slope: 2.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.1-46.3). The non-parametric LOESS analysis showed a non-linear relationship between MRIvol and RPvol. Significant underestimation was reported across all volumes with the highest differences between MRIvol and RPvol in the low volume range (<2 mL), where RPvol almost doubled MRIvol. A similar effect was observed across all PI-RADS scores subgroups.  Conclusions:   In the present study, mpMRI significantly underestimated the exact volume of the IL, especially for small visible lesions, regardless of PI-RADS score.

This is the first qualitative study that aimed to provide insights into PC survivors' adjustment to diagnosis and any persisting or emerging cancer/treatment-related issues over 15+ years.  Methods:   Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 37 men purposively sampled from the 15-year follow-up phase of a population-wide cohort study, the New South Wales Prostate Cancer Care and Outcomes Study (PCOS). Interview data were transcribed and thematically analysed applying a framework methodology.  Results:   The majority of participating men (88.6%) had been diagnosed with localised disease and were treated with radical prostatectomy as primary treatment (54.1%). Four main interconnecting themes relating to men's long-term survivorship experience with PC were identified: (1) Survivorship reflections, (2) interactions with the healthcare system, (3) personal and social relationships and (4) dominant coping strategies. Many men reported gaps along the continuum of care and a feeling of abandonment across their long-term survivorship, encompassed by a perceived lack of psychosocial and informational support for persisting treatment side-effects, especially sexual dysfunction. Receiving adequate survivorship care and trusting patient-clinician relationships appeared to be associated with greater resilience and positivity in the men's acceptance of cancer-related long-term challenges and personal limitations.  Conclusions:   Long-term PC survivors continue to experience lasting treatment impacts, with many men reporting unmet needs and a lack of continuity of multidisciplinary care. Implementation of coordinated and tailored survivorship care and shared care pathways with multidisciplinary practitioners will facilitate men's improved engagement and timely access to supportive care interventions, helping to avoid the 'survivorship abyss'.""","""['Carolyn G Mazariego', 'Rebekah Laidsaar-Powell', 'David P Smith', 'Ilona Juraskova']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Psychooncology""","""['Long-term unmet supportive care needs of prostate cancer survivors: 15-year follow-up from the NSW Prostate Cancer Care and Outcomes Study.', 'The unmet needs of childhood cancer survivors in long-term follow-up care: A qualitative study.', 'Quality of life, coping strategies, and supportive care needs in head and neck cancer survivors: a qualitative study.', 'Sexual Health Recovery For Prostate Cancer Survivors: The Proposed Role Of Acceptance And Mindfulness-Based Interventions.', 'Mobile health (mHealth) interventions in prostate cancer survivorship: a scoping review.', 'The lived experience of prostate cancer: 10-year survivor perspectives following contemporary treatment of localized prostate cancer.']"""

The resolution of endoDPT was characterized through measurement of the modulation transfer function (MTF) and artifact spread function (ASF) in computational and physical phantoms. The qualitative resolution of endoDPT was assessed relative to computed tomography (CT) through imaging of LDRBT seeds implanted inex vivocanine prostates. The x-ray sensor MTF reached 10% at 11.50 mm-1, the reconstruction algorithm MTF reached a maximum at 7.08 mm-1, and the ASF was 2.5 mm (full-width at half-maximum). Fine structures in LDRBT seeds like the 0.05 mm thick shell were visible with endoDPT but not CT. All endoDPT images exhibited an overshoot artifact. The measured MTFs were consistent with other studies using similar x-ray sensors and demonstrated improved resolution compared to digital breast tomosynthesis; this result was due to the smaller endoDPT x-ray sensor detection element size and quantitatively demonstrates the high resolution of endoDPT. The ASF demonstrated worse depth resolution compared to in-plane resolution, due to partial angular sampling; partial angular sampling also caused the observed overshoot artifact in the endoDPT images. However, endoDPT still was able to visualize fine structures such as the LDRBT seed shell to a much higher degree than CT. This high-resolution visualization may be useful for improvements in patient specific LDRBT dosimetry. Overall, these results indicate endoDPT is capable of high in-plane spatial resolution and is thus well poised for optimization and studies assessing clinical utility.""","""['Joseph Steiner', 'Kenneth Matthews nd', 'Guang Jia']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Biomed Phys Eng Express""","""['Second generation stationary digital breast tomosynthesis system with faster scan time and wider angular span.', 'High resolution stationary digital breast tomosynthesis using distributed carbon nanotube x-ray source array.', 'Implementation and evaluation of an expectation maximization reconstruction algorithm for gamma emission breast tomosynthesis.', 'Advances in digital and physical anthropomorphic breast phantoms for x-ray imaging.', 'Digital tomosynthesis: technique.']"""

Methods:   The AUTO BAO plans are generated using fully automated prioritized multicriterial optimization (AUTO MCO) of pencil-beam fluence maps with integrated noncoplanar beam angle optimization (BAO), followed by MLC segment generation. Both the AUTO MCO and segmentation algorithms have been developed in-house. AUTO MCO generates for each patient a single, high-quality Pareto-optimal IMRT plan. The segmentation algorithm then accurately mimics the AUTO MCO 3D dose distribution, while considering all candidate beams simultaneously, rather than replicating the fluence maps. Pencil-beams, segment dose depositions, and final dose calculations are performed with a stand-alone version of the clinical dose calculation engine. For validation, AUTO BAO plans were generated for 33 prostate SBRT patients and compared to reference plans (REF) that were manually generated with the commercial treatment planning system (TPS), in absence of time pressure. REF plans were also compared to AUTO RB plans, for which fluence map optimization was performed for the beam angle configuration used in the REF plan, and the segmentation could use all these beams or only a subset, depending on the dosimetry.  Results:   AUTO BAO plans were clinically acceptable and dosimetrically similar to REF plans, but had on average reduced numbers of beams ((beams in AUTO BAO)/(beams in REF) (relative improvement): 24.7/48.3 (-49%)), segments (59.5/98.9 (-40%)), and delivery times (17.1/22.3 min. (-23%)). Dosimetry of AUTO RB and REF were also similar, but AUTO RB used on average fewer beams (38.0/48.3 (-21%)) and had on average shorter delivery times (18.6/22.3 min. (-17%)). Delivered Monitor Units (MU) were similar for all three planning approaches.  Conclusions:   A new, vendor-independent optimization workflow for fully automated generation of deliverable high-quality CyberKnife® plans was proposed, including BAO. Compared to manual planning with the commercial TPS, fraction delivery times were reduced by 5.3 min.

Methods:   A Markov model was developed to capture time spent by patients in various health states: stable, progression and death. Abiraterone acetate and docetaxel were set as active comparators. Clinical outcomes were obtained from the PREVAIL, COU-AA-302 and TAX327 trials. Treatment sequence, concomitant drugs and therapies for adverse events were estimated from responses to a survey by 14 Japanese prostate cancer experts. The analytic perspective was public healthcare payer, with a 10-year time horizon. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated from quality-adjusted life-years and Japanese public healthcare costs. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the findings.  Results:   According to the survey, the most common treatment sequences were (i) enzalutamide → docetaxel → cabazitaxel (enzalutamide-first sequencing), (ii) abiraterone → enzalutamide → docetaxel (abiraterone-first sequencing) and (iii) docetaxel→ enzalutamide → cabazitaxel (docetaxel-first sequencing). In the base-case analysis, enzalutamide-first sequencing saved 1.74 million Japanese Yen versus abiraterone-first sequencing, with a 0.129 quality-adjusted life-year gain (dominant). Enzalutamide-first sequencing had a cost increase of 4.44 million Japanese Yen over docetaxel-first sequencing, with a 0.371 quality-adjusted life-years gain. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of enzalutamide-first sequencing versus docetaxel-first sequencing was estimated as 11.94 million Japanese Yen/quality-adjusted life-years. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that, compared with abiraterone-first sequencing, enzalutamide-first sequencing had an 87.4% probability of being dominant.

Expression of miR-182 and ST6GALNAC5 in tumor tissues and the Du145 PCa cell line was analyzed. Cell proliferation assay, colony formation assay, transwell assay, and wound healing assay were performed. The impact of miR-182 on tumor growth was investigated using a xenograft model. The results indicated that expression of miR-182 was higher in PCa tissues and cell lines, while ST6GALNAC5 was decreased. Downregulating miR-182 significantly inhibited the capacities of proliferation and invasion of PC3 and Du145 cells. ST6GALNAC5 was demonstrated to be a target of miR-182 by luciferase assay, and western blot results indicated PI3K/Akt pathway was involved in miR-182 associated effects on PC3 and Du145 cells. The animal experiment suggested that knockdown of miR-182 inhibited tumor growth.

Patients and methods:   We identified 1513 patients who underwent ORP with PLND between July 2018 and November 2019. Of those, 307 patients (20.3%) received peritoneal fenestration and 1206 (79.7%) no fenestration. The rate of LCs and the necessity for intervention were analysed by uni- and multivariable logistic regression (MLR) models. A propensity score matching was performed, as well.  Results:   The median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 65 (60-70) years. A median (IQR) of 16 (10-22) lymph nodes were dissected, 22 vs 14 lymph nodes in the fenestration vs non-fenestration group (P < 0.001). Overall, 189 patients (12.5%) were diagnosed with a LC after ORP, while 21 patients (6.8%) in the fenestration and 168 (13.9%) in the non-fenestration group had LCs (P = 0.001). In 70 patients (4.7%), LCs required further intervention, categorised as Clavien-Dindo Grade IIIa/b, with a smaller proportion in the fenestration group (2.9% vs 5.0% in the non-fenestration group, P < 0.001). There were no Clavien-Dindo Grade IV or V complications, in particular no abdominal complications in association with peritoneal fenestration observed. In MLR, peritoneal fenestration was associated with a reduced risk of LCs (odds ratio [OR] 0.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.2-0.5; P < 0.001). The risk reduction was also shown after propensity score matching (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.21-0.68; P = 0.001). The number needed to treat was 14.

It accounts for about 4% of cancer-related mortality in men. Several genetic polymorphisms in different genes have been identified that alter the risk of this kind of malignancy.  Materials and methods:   We used the random forest (RF) algorithm for prediction of prostate cancer risk in Iranian population using 13 different single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in four genes (ANRIL, HOTAIR, IL-6 and IL-8). The samples were divided into a training set (n=320) and a test set (n=80) to evaluate the generalization power for training algorithm. For hyper-parameters tuning, we used randomized search with 5-fold cross-validation for the following hyper-parameters: (1) Number of trees or estimators in the forest (set from 3 to 500); (2) The maximum number of leaf nodes (set from 2 to 32); (3) The maximum number of features used for the best split (set from 5 to 13); and (4) Using bootstrap samples in the trees building (True or False). Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score in both training and test sets were reported.  Results:   The most important SNP was ANRIL-rs1333048: A/A (Gini index= 0.096) followed by ANRIL- rs10757278: G/G (Gini index= 0.059).

Methods:   We evaluated the association of the GPS result assayed from the index lesion from RP tissue with the risk of distant metastases (DM) and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) over the 20 years following RP in a stratified cohort sample of 428 patients from 2,641 treated between 1987 and 2004. Cox regression of cause-specific hazards was used to estimate the absolute risk of both end points, with death from other causes treated as a competing risk. A correction for regression to the mean (RM) was applied since the GPS test was developed using this cohort. Exploratory analysis using presurgical parameters and the GPS test as prognostic variables was performed to assess the additional value of the GPS test on 20-year risk of DM and PCSM. Model discrimination was measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.  Results:   The GPS test appears to be independently associated with both 20-year risk of DM and PCSM with a low false discovery rate. Per 20-unit increase in GPS, multivariable analysis with RM correction estimated hazard ratios of 2.24 (95% CI, 1.49 to 3.53) and 2.30 (95% CI, 1.45 to 4.36) for DM and PCSM, respectively.

Here, we investigated whether chronic intestinal inflammation leads to pro-inflammatory changes associated with tumorigenesis in the prostate.  Methods:   Using clinical samples of men with IBD who underwent prostatectomy, we analyzed whether prostate tumors had differences in lymphocyte infiltrate compared to non-IBD controls. In a mouse model of chemically-induced intestinal inflammation, we investigated whether chronic intestinal inflammation could be transferred to the wild-type mouse prostate. In addition, mouse prostates were evaluated for activation of pro-oncogenic signaling and genomic instability.  Results:   A higher proportion of men with IBD had T and B lymphocyte infiltration within prostate tumors. Mice with chronic colitis showed significant increases in prostatic CD45 + leukocyte infiltration and elevation of three pro-inflammatory cytokines-TIMP-1, CCL5, and CXCL1 and activation of AKT and NF-kB signaling pathways. Lastly, mice with chronic colitis had greater prostatic oxidative stress/DNA damage, and prostate epithelial cells had undergone cell cycle arrest.

Although most patients respond well to initial therapy, resistance eventually develops, and thus, more effective therapeutic approaches are needed. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is highly expressed in prostate cancer and presents an attractive target for radionuclide therapy. Here, we evaluated the efficacy and explored the mode of action of the PSMA-targeted thorium-227 conjugate (PSMA-TTC) BAY 2315497, an antibody-based targeted alpha-therapy, in combination with the AR inhibitor darolutamide.  Experimental design:   The in vitro and in vivo antitumor efficacy and mode of action of the combination treatment were investigated in preclinical cell line-derived and patient-derived prostate cancer xenograft models with different levels of PSMA expression.  Results:   Darolutamide induced the expression of PSMA in androgen-sensitive VCaP and LNCaP cells in vitro, and the efficacy of darolutamide in combination with PSMA-TTC was synergistic in these cells. In vivo, the combination treatment showed synergistic antitumor efficacy in the low PSMA-expressing VCaP and in the high PSMA-expressing ST1273 prostate cancer models, and enhanced efficacy in the enzalutamide-resistant KUCaP-1 model. The treatments were well tolerated. Mode-of-action studies revealed that darolutamide induced PSMA expression, resulting in higher tumor uptake of PSMA-TTC, and consequently, higher antitumor efficacy, and impaired PSMA-TTC-mediated induction of DNA damage repair genes, potentially contributing to increased DNA damage.

Case presentation:   In all cases, we implanted 125I sources using a modified peripheral loading pattern for seed placement. The prescribed dose for each implant was 110 Gy. After delivering the sources, a hydrogel spacer was injected. All cases underwent external-beam radiation therapy approximately 1-2 months after brachytherapy. The prescribed dose of external-beam radiation therapy was 45 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed for evaluation on the day following seed implantation (baseline), at external-beam radiation therapy planning, and during external-beam radiation therapy. The median hydrogel spacer volume was 16.2 (range 10.9-17.7) cc at baseline, 14.4 (range, 9.4-16.1) cc at external-beam radiation therapy planning, and 7.1 (range, 2.0-11.4) cc during external-beam radiation therapy.

The survival time of patients was compared between groups according to the mRNA expression level of IQGAP2. Survival analyses were performed in different subgroups when considering the effect of age, tumour stage, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration, performance status, and the number of extra nodal disease sites. The biological processes associated with IQGAP2-associated mRNAs were analysed to predict the function of IQGAP2. The correlation of IQGAP2 mRNA with immunosuppressive genes and leukocyte infiltration were analysed.  Results:   The overall survival of patients with increased IQGAP2 mRNA levels was reduced even after aggressive treatment independent of age, tumour stage, serum LDH concentration, performance status, and the number of extra nodal disease sites. Furthermore, the biological processes of IQGAP2-associated mRNAs were mainly immune processes. IQGAP2 mRNA expression was correlated with the expression of immunosuppressive genes and leukocyte infiltration.  Conclusion:   IQGAP2 mRNA is an independent prognostic factor and is related to immunosuppression in DLBCL. This discovery may provide a promising target for further development of therapy.""","""['Tianjiao Tang#', 'Jing Wang#', 'Lidan Zhang', 'Ying Cheng', 'Laura Saleh', 'Yanni Gu', 'Hongbin Zhang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['LincRNA-p21 predicts favorable clinical outcome and impairs tumorigenesis in diffuse large B cell lymphoma patients treated with R-CHOP chemotherapy.', 'Prognostic impact of p53 aberrations for R-CHOP-treated patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.', 'Clinical prognostic factors of diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma: a retrospective study.', 'Treatment of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.', 'How gene polymorphisms can influence clinical response and toxicity following R-CHOP therapy in patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma.', 'Construction and validation of an immune infiltration-related risk model for predicting prognosis and immunotherapy response in low grade glioma.', 'The Antithetic Roles of IQGAP2 and IQGAP3 in Cancers.', 'Upregulation of Actin-Related Protein 2 (ACTR2) Exacerbated the Malignancy of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma through Activating Wnt Signaling.', 'Long non-coding ribonucleic acid ATP2B1-AS1 modulates endothelial permeability through regulating the miR-4729-IQGAP2 axis in diabetic retinopathy.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated 66 mHSPC patients with high tumor burden who received upfront ABI between 2018 and 2020 (upfront ABI group). We divided these patients into two groups: the anemia-ABI group (hemoglobin < 13.0 g/dL, n = 20) and the non-anemia-ABI group (n = 46). The primary objective was to examine the impact of anemia on the progression-free survival (PFS; clinical progression or PC death before development of castration resistant PC) of patients in the upfront ABI group. Secondary objectives included an evaluation of the prognostic significance of upfront ABI and a comparison with a historical cohort (131 mHSPC patients with high tumor burden who received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT/complete androgen blockade [CAB] group) between 2014 and 2019).  Results:   We found that the anemia-ABI group had a significantly shorter PFS than the non-anemia-ABI group. A multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that anemia was an independent prognostic factor of PFS in the upfront ABI group (hazard ratio, 4.66; P = 0.014). Patients in the non-anemia-ABI group were determined to have a significantly longer PFS than those in the non-anemia-ADT/CAB group (n = 68) (P < 0.001). However, no significant difference was observed in the PFS between patients in the anemia-ABI and the anemia-ADT/CAB groups (n = 63). Multivariate analyses showed that upfront ABI could significantly prolong the PFS of patients without anemia (hazard ratio, 0.17; P < 0.001), whereas ABI did not prolong the PFS of patients with anemia.  Conclusion:   Pretreatment anemia was a prognostic factor among mHSPC patients who received upfront ABI.

Emerging evidence indicates that TPD52 isoform 1, a prostate-specific and androgen-responsive gene, contributes to the malignant progression of PCa. Here, we demonstrate that TPD52 enhances CMA activation by interacting with HSPA8/HSC70 and enhancing substrate degradation in PCa. Elevation of TPD52 is essential for CMA-induced PCa cell proliferation and stress resistance in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, TPD52 is acetylated by KAT2B at K163, which is a process that can be antagonized by HDAC2. Inactivation of HDAC2 results in elevated TPD52 acetylation, which compromises the interaction between TPD52 and HSPA8, leading to impaired CMA function and tumor growth in vivo. Taken together, our findings reveal that acetylation-dependent regulation of TPD52 modulates CMA oncogenic function in PCa, thereby suggesting the possibility of targeting the TPD52-mediated CMA pathway to control the progression of PCa.Abbreviations: CMA: chaperone-mediated autophagy; HDAC2: histone deacetylase 2; HSPA8/HSC70: heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 8; KAT2B: lysine acetyltransferase 2B; LAMP2A: lysosomal associated membrane protein 2A; PCa: prostate cancer; TPD52: tumor protein D52.""","""['Yizeng Fan', 'Tao Hou', 'Yang Gao', 'Weichao Dan', 'Tianjie Liu', 'Bo Liu', 'Yule Chen', 'Hongjun Xie', 'Zhao Yang', 'Jiaqi Chen', 'Jin Zeng', 'Lei Li']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Autophagy""","""['Impaired degradation of YAP1 and IL6ST by chaperone-mediated autophagy promotes proliferation and migration of normal and hepatocellular carcinoma cells.', 'Age-dependent accumulation of oligomeric SNCA/α-synuclein from impaired degradation in mutant LRRK2 knockin mouse model of Parkinson disease: role for therapeutic activation of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA).', 'Stabilization of MORC2 by estrogen and antiestrogens through GPER1- PRKACA-CMA pathway contributes to estrogen-induced proliferation and endocrine resistance of breast cancer cells.', 'Chaperone-Mediated Autophagy and Its Emerging Role in Hematological Malignancies.', 'Molecular control of chaperone-mediated autophagy.', 'FDW028, a novel FUT8 inhibitor, impels lysosomal proteolysis of B7-H3 via chaperone-mediated autophagy pathway and exhibits potent efficacy against metastatic colorectal cancer.', 'The Complex Role of Chaperone-Mediated Autophagy in Cancer Diseases.', 'Protein posttranslational modifications in health and diseases: Functions, regulatory mechanisms, and therapeutic implications.', 'HSPA8 Is a New Biomarker of Triple Negative Breast Cancer Related to Prognosis and Immune Infiltration.', 'The role of protein acetylation in carcinogenesis and targeted drug discovery.']"""

Incidental prostate cancer refers to prostate cancer detected in radical cystectomy specimens in patients with no signs of the disease. Objective of this study is to report the prevalence, characteristics, and clinical significance of incidental prostate cancer in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients treated with radical cystectomy in our department.  Material and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed data from 41 patients who underwent radical cystectomy for non-muscle invasive, high risk, bladder cancer during the years 2016-2020 in our department. Prostate cancer was described as clinically significant when there were positive surgical margins, extraprostatic extension, Gleason score >6, or tumor volume ⩾0.5 cm3. Two groups of patients were formed according to the presence or absence of clinically significant prostate cancer.  Results:   Incidental prostate cancer in the cystectomy specimens was detected in 21 of the 35 patients investigated. Clinically significant prostate cancer was detected in five patients. Positive surgical margins and extraprostatic extension were present in one patient, respectively. Gleason score was more than six in four of the five patients and PCa tumor volume was above 0.5 cm3 in three patients. Two patients with clinically significant prostate cancer were diagnosed with biochemical recurrence during their follow up.

Therefore, blocking androgen receptor remains a therapeutic goal of CRPC. However, resistance to androgen receptor inhibitors, for example, enzalutamide, limits therapeutic efficacy for many patients. In this study, to develop an enzalutamide-resistant cell model for molecular mechanism investigation of enzalutamide-resistance, we continuously treated C4-2B cells with multiplied concentrations of enzalutamide. The IC50 of resistant cells was identified as 14.7705 µM, and the resistance index was calculated as 12.4. In addition, we verified the resistance of resistant cells through experiments in vivo and found the genes in androgen receptor signaling pathway (androgen receptor, Jagged1, Notch1) and those in androgen receptor alternative signaling pathways behaved the opposite. For some of the former, their mRNA and protein expression reduced markedly while for the latter, for example, CXCR7, AKT, STAT3, FOXP3, they rose dramatically in the expression level of protein and mRNA. More importantly, the tumor volume, tumor wet weight, PSA and VEGF secretion level, positive staining rate of Ki67 nuclei in resistant strain heterogeneous tumor treated with enzalutamide were significantly higher than those of maternal cell heterogeneous tumor treated with enzalutamide, whereas no obvious difference was detected between resistant strain heterogeneous tumor treated with enzalutamide and those of the resistant strain treated with reference drug. Finally, we identified 654 differentially expression genes and 2 compounds (atracurium besilate, methotrexates) associated with the amelioration of enzalutamide-resistance. Overall, we successfully established an enzalutamide-resistance cell model and screened out some resistance genes and candidate small molecule drugs.""","""['Tao Feng', 'Dechao Wei', 'Jiahui Zhao', 'Qiankun Li', 'Pengju Guo', 'Xiaobing Yang', 'Mingchuan Li', 'Yongguang Jiang', 'Yong Luo']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Exp Biol Med (Maywood)""","""['Metabolic Reprogramming and Predominance of Solute Carrier Genes during Acquired Enzalutamide Resistance in Prostate Cancer.', 'Lycopene enhances the sensitivity of castration-resistant prostate cancer to enzalutamide through the AKT/EZH2/ androgen receptor signaling pathway.', 'Preclinical studies using cisplatin/carboplatin to restore the Enzalutamide sensitivity via degrading the androgen receptor splicing variant 7 (ARv7) to further suppress Enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer.', 'Mechanisms of enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer and therapeutic strategies to overcome it.', 'Drug Resistance of Enzalutamide in CRPC.', 'Antiandrogen-Equipped Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Selectively Inhibit Androgen Receptor (AR) and AR-Splice Variant (AR-SV) in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC).', 'VIM‑AS1 promotes proliferation and drives enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer via IGF2BP2‑mediated HMGCS1 mRNA stabilization.', 'Enzalutamide-Resistant Progression of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Is Driven via the JAK2/STAT1-Dependent Pathway.']"""

We assessed the associations in a discovery data set of 1185 NSCLC patients from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial and validated the findings in another data set of 984 patients from the Harvard Lung Cancer Susceptibility Study. As a result, we identified three independent SNPs (ie, CHEK1 rs76744140 T>C, PRIM2 rs6939623 G>T and CDK6 rs113181986 G>C) to be significantly associated with NSCLC OS with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.29 (95% confidence interval = 1.11-1.49, P = 8.26 × 10-4 ), 1.26 (1.12-1.42, 1.10 × 10-4 ) and 0.73 (0.63-0.86, 1.63 × 10-4 ), respectively. Moreover, the number of combined unfavorable genotypes of these three SNPs was significantly associated with NSCLC OS and disease-specific survival in the PLCO data set (Ptrend < .0001 and .0003, respectively). Further expression quantitative trait loci analysis showed that the rs76744140C allele predicted CHEK1 mRNA expression levels in normal lung tissues and that rs113181986C allele predicted CDK6 mRNA expression levels in whole blood tissues.

M2000 (β-d-mannuronic acid) is a novel anti-inflammatory drug. According to its potential capacity for the inhibition of molecules involved in creating conditions of inflammation, it is reasonable to assess the anti-inflammatory role of M2000 in PCa cells.Methods: MTT assay was performed to determine the cytotoxicity of M2000 in PC3 cells. Correspondingly, these cells were cultured and then treated with low (25 µg/ml) and high (50 µg/ml) doses of M2000 as optimal doses. Thereafter, real-time RT-PCR, flow cytometry analysis, and zymography were performed to evaluate the expressions of MYD-88, NF-kB, IL-8, COX-2, MMP-2, and MMP-9 molecules. Results: Of note, the M2000 at the concentration of ≤200 μg/ml had no cytotoxicity effect on the cells. MYD-88 gene expression was significantly down-regulated at both low and high doses in the M2000-treated cells compared to the control (p = .017 and p = .001, respectively). The expression of the NF-kB was also reduced at both the gene and protein levels (all p values were <.001). The expression of IL-8 and COX-2 genes was also down-regulated in the high dose of M2000 (p<.001, p = .001, respectively). The decreased expression of the MMP-9 gene was observed at both doses (both p values were <.001).Conclusion: Inhibitory effects of M2000 on the activity of MMPs in the LPS/M2000-treated cells were evident, but not in the M2000-treated cells.

Methods:   In partnership with UCOG-pl, OMEDIT and Observatoire du Cancer, we realised an observational survey from April to September 2017. Three questionnaires were sent to coordonary doctors (CD), nurses and paramedics, along with informative documents.  Results:   In 589 nursing homes, 82 CD, 147 nurses and 240 paramedics gave an answer. The estimation of cancer's prevalence was 8,75%. Breast and prostate cancers were the most frequent. Nursing homes were an appropriate place to screen cancers by 79% of professionals. Some difficulties were reported by more than 80 % of them (coordination, residents' relationships...). At least, 20% of professionals couldn't define properly oncogeriatric. Only 73% of CD, 16% of nurses and 5% of paramedics knew about ongeriatric evaluations.

Oral chemotherapy was already used by 90% of nurses, but the follow-up was considered inadequate.  Discussion:   Our survey shows a low awareness about oncogeriatric by the nursing home's professionals. This misreading and under-diagnosis of cancer in nursing homes could partly explain by the lake of training, communication and coordination with oncology professionals and the distinctive characteristics of nursing home's residents.

Our objective was to perform a qualitative study of the barriers and facilitators of germline genetic evaluation among physicians who manage PCa.  Methods:   We conducted semi-structured interviews with medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and urologists from different U.S. practice settings until thematic saturation was achieved at n = 14. The interview guide was based on the Tailored Implementation in Chronic Diseases Framework to identify key determinants of practice. Interview transcripts were independently coded by ≥2 investigators using a constant comparative method.  Results:   The decision to perform or refer for germline genetic evaluation is affected by factors at multiple levels. Although patient factors sometimes play a role, the dominant themes in the decision to conduct germline genetic evaluation were at the physician and organizational level. Physician knowledge, coordination of care, perceptions of the guidelines, and concerns about cost were most frequently discussed as the main factors affecting utilization of germline genetic evaluation.  Conclusions:   There are currently numerous barriers to implementation of germline genetic evaluation for PCa. Efforts to expand physician education, to develop tools to enhance genetics in practice, and to facilitate coordination of care surrounding genetic evaluation are important to promote guideline-concordant care.""","""['Stacy Loeb', 'Randall Li', 'Tatiana Sanchez Nolasco', 'Nataliya Byrne', 'Heather H Cheng', 'Daniel Becker', 'Amy E Leader', 'Veda N Giri']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Knowledge and practice regarding prostate cancer germline testing among urologists: Gaps to address for optimal implementation✰,✰✰.', 'Germline Genetic Testing in Advanced Prostate Cancer; Practices and Barriers: Survey Results from the Germline Genetics Working Group of the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium.', 'Helix: A Digital Tool to Address Provider Needs for Prostate Cancer Genetic Testing in Clinical Practice.', 'Genetic Testing Guidelines and Education of Health Care Providers Involved in Prostate Cancer Care.', 'Clinical Implications of Germline Testing in Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer.', 'Clinical Impact of a Rapid Genetic Testing Model for Advanced Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Psychosocial factors impacting barriers and motivators to cancer genetic testing.', 'Internet-Based Germline Genetic Testing for Men With Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate cancer risk, screening and management in patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations.', 'Gene-based Confirmatory Germline Testing Following Tumor-only Sequencing of Prostate Cancer.']"""

The utility of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) in detecting prostate cancer (PCa) shows promise to be used as triage test for systematic prostate biopsy. Our aim is to Study clinical parameters and oncological outcomes in men with negative mpMRI (nMRI; PI-RADS v2 scores of ≤ 2) who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) to evaluate nMRI's practicality as a biopsy triage test.  Methods:   Retrospective analysis of 331 men with nMRI who underwent RARP between 2014 and 2020 compared with men with positive mpMRI (pMRI; PI-RADS v2 scores ≥ 3, N = 1770). csPCa was defined as Gleason score ≥ 3 + 4 and biochemical recurrence (BCR) was defined as PSA > 0.2 ng/ml on two occasions. Biopsies were graded with the International Society of Urologic Pathology [ISUP] grade. Descriptive statistics for nMRI and pMRI were performed. Mann-Whitney U test was used for continuous variables and χ 2 for categorical variables. Univariable and multivariable regression analyses were performed.  Results:   Univariable analysis shows statistically significant difference (p < .05) between median age (nMRI-61 years vs. pMRI 63 years), race (higher incidence of nMRI in African American men), use of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (higher rate in nMRI). While incidence rates of family history of PCa, suspicious digital rectal examination (DRE) findings, median PSA levels and 4Kscore, were lower in nMRI versus pMRI. Rates of positive surgical margins and BCR were comparable in nMRI versus pMRI. Biopsy ISUP Grades I and II upgraded by 51% and 12%, respectively in final pathology. African American race and no history of the prior negative biopsy were significant predictors for upgrading.

This meta-analysis was performed to precisely assess this association. Relevant published studies were selected by retrieving studies from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CNKI and Chinese Wanfang databases. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were applied to evaluate the strength of PRNCR1 polymorphisms correlated with cancer susceptibility. A total of 12 articles, containing 40 independent case-control studies and seven SNPs (rs1016343, rs13252298, rs16901946, rs7007694, rs1456315, rs13254738 and rs7463708), were ultimately included in our meta-analysis. Summary results revealed a significant association with an increased overall risk of cancer for the rs1016343 C>T polymorphism (T vs C: OR=1.19, 95% CI=1.02-1.39; TT+CT vs CC: OR= 1.25, 95% CI=1.05-1.49) and rs16901946 A>G polymorphism (G vs A: OR=1.17, 95% CI=1.09-1.27; GG+AG vs AA: OR=1.20, 95% CI=1.09-1.32). Moreover, evidence of the rs13252298 A>G polymorphism correlation with decreased overall risk of cancer was observed (GG vs AG+AA: OR=0.78, 95% CI =0.67-0.92). Subgroup analyses by cancer type and ethnicity also revealed that the rs1016343 C>T polymorphism was linked with an increased risk of prostate cancer and Caucasians, respectively. The rs13252298 A>G polymorphism was correlated with a decreased risk of colorectal cancer and prostate cancer. The rs16901946 A>G polymorphism was related to an increased risk of gastric cancer and colorectal cancer in Asians. Additionally, the rs13254738 A>C polymorphism was correlated with reduced cancer risk in Asians. No correlations were discovered with cancer risk in rs7007694 T>C, rs7463708 T>G, and rs1456315 A>G polymorphisms.

However, due to its low solubility, its biomedical application has been limited. Using mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNPs), such as Mobil Composition of Matter Number 41 (MCM-41), as a drug carrier, is a promising approach to improve the solubility of low water-soluble drugs. In the present work, we aim to develop TBZ-loaded MCM-41 (TBZ MCM-41) nanoparticles to improve the solubility and the therapeutic efficacy of TBZ against prostate cancer PC-3 cells. TBZ MCM-41 nanoparticles were synthesized with a size of 215.9 ± 0.07 nm, a spherical shape, a hexagonal array of channels, and a drug loading capacity of 19.1%. The biological effects of the nanoformulation on PC-3 cells were then evaluated using a 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT), IncuCyte live-cell imaging system, cell migration, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays. The results demonstrated that TBZ was released from MCM-41 nanoparticles in a controlled manner at pH values of 1.2 and 6.8. The cell viability measurements revealed that the TBZ MCM-41 nanoparticles caused a considerable 2.8-fold increase in the cytotoxicity of TBZ (IC50 127.3 and 46 μM for TBZ and TBZ MCM-41 nanoparticles, respectively). The results of the proliferation assay were in agreement with those of the cell viability measurements, where the MCM-41 increased the cytotoxicity of TBZ in a concentration-dependent manner. Also, the TBZ MCM-41 nanoparticles were found to enhance the potency of the drug and inhibit PC-3 cell migration. In addition, the ROS assay confirmed that TBZ MCM-41 nanoparticles were approximately 15% more potent than TBZ to produce ROS. Overall, the results demonstrated that MCM-41 nanoparticles are a promising carrier to improve the therapeutic efficacy of TBZ against PC-3 cells and suggest evaluating the efficacy of the formulation in vivo.""","""['Maedeh Koohi Moftakhari Esfahani', 'Nazrul Islam', 'Peter J Cabot', 'Emad L Izake']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""ACS Biomater Sci Eng""","""['β-Lactoglobulin-Modified Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles: A Promising Carrier for the Targeted Delivery of Fenbendazole into Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Enhancing the efficacy of albendazole for liver cancer treatment using mesoporous silica nanoparticles: an in vitro study.', 'PEGylated Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles (MCM-41): A Promising Carrier for the Targeted Delivery of Fenbendazole into Prostrate Cancer Cells.', 'Functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles in anticancer therapeutics.', 'Mesoporous silica nanoparticles: synthesis methods and their therapeutic use-recent advances.', 'Advanced Drug Delivery Platforms for the Treatment of Oral Pathogens.', 'Application of Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles in Cancer Therapy and Delivery of Repurposed Anthelmintics for Cancer Therapy.', 'β-Lactoglobulin-Modified Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles: A Promising Carrier for the Targeted Delivery of Fenbendazole into Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Enhancing the efficacy of albendazole for liver cancer treatment using mesoporous silica nanoparticles: an in vitro study.', 'Synthesis of Copper Oxide-Based Nanoformulations of Etoricoxib and Montelukast and Their Evaluation through Analgesic, Anti-Inflammatory, Anti-Pyretic, and Acute Toxicity Activities.']"""

This study aimed to assess its potential for the imaging of prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   Seventeen patients with histologically proven PCa were enrolled. DWI of the prostate was performed with linear and spherical tensor encoding using a maximal b-value of 1.5 ms/µm2 and a voxel size of 3 × 3 × 4 mm3 . The gamma-distribution model was used to estimate the mean diffusivity (MD), the isotropic kurtosis (MKI ), and the anisotropic kurtosis (MKA ). Regions of interest were placed in MR-defined cancerous tissues, as well as in apparently healthy tissues in the peripheral and transitional zones (PZs and TZs).  Results:   DWI with linear and spherical encoding yielded different image contrasts at high b-values, which enabled the estimation of MKA and MKI . Compared with healthy tissue (PZs and TZs combined) the cancers displayed a significantly lower MD (P < .05), higher MKI (P < 10-5 ), and lower MKA (P < .05). Compared with the TZ, tissue in the PZ showed lower MD (P < 10-3 ) and higher MKA (P < 10-3 ). No significant differences were found between cancers of different Gleason scores, possibly because of the limited sample size.  Conclusion:   Tensor-valued diffusion encoding enabled mapping of MKA and MKI in the prostate. The elevated MKI in PCa compared with normal tissues suggests an elevated heterogeneity in the cancers.

Many therapies are used to treat prostate cancer, and chemotherapy is one of the most relevant treatments. However, chemotherapy has many side effects, and repeated administration of chemotherapeutic agents leads to acquired resistance. Thus, new drugs with few side effects are needed. We investigated the molecular mechanism of action of JI017 in human prostate cancer cells. We identified an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway that depended on the reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathway and played a crucial role in JI017-induced apoptosis. We measured cell viability by the MTS assay to determine the effect of JI017. Analysis of apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell cycle features was performed by flow cytometry. We used western blot and RT-PCR to measure the levels of the proteins of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway and apoptosis markers. Immunoprecipitation assay and transfection were used to determine the expression levels of proteins interacting with the pathways influenced by JI017 in prostate cancer cells. The anticancer effects induced by JI017 were evaluated. JI017 induced cell death that regulated apoptotic molecules and caused cell cycle arrest that inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells. Moreover, JI017 generated ROS. Accumulation of ROS caused ER stress through the PERK-eIF2α-CHOP and IRE1α-CHOP pathways. Furthermore, persistent activation of the UPR pathway induced by JI017 treatment triggered mitochondrial dysfunction, including dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, which activated intrinsic apoptotic pathway in human prostate cancer cells. The data indicated that N-acetyl-L-cysteine diminished apoptosis. We demonstrated that JI017 induced ER stress and cell death. Anticancer properties of JI017 in prostate cancer cells and in a human prostate cancer model involved ROS-mediated ER stress. Thus, JI017 treatment provides a new strategy for chemotherapy of prostate cancer.""","""['Min Jeong Kim', 'Jin Mo Ku', 'Se Hyang Hong', 'Hyo In Kim', 'Yun Young Kwon', 'Joon-Sang Park', 'Deok Hyun Jung', 'Yong Cheol Shin', 'Seong-Gyu Ko']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Front Pharmacol""","""['JI017 Induces Cell Autophagy and Apoptosis via Elevated Levels of Reactive Oxygen Species in Human Lung Cancer Cells.', 'The Herbal Formula JI017 Induces ER Stress via Nox4 in Breast Cancer Cells.', 'JI017, a Complex Herbal Medication, Induces Apoptosis via the Nox4-PERK-CHOP Axis in Ovarian Cancer Cells.', 'A new strategy of promoting cisplatin chemotherapeutic efficiency by targeting endoplasmic reticulum stress.', 'The Role of Silver Nanoparticles in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Cancer: Are There Any Perspectives for the Future?', 'JI017 Induces Cell Autophagy and Apoptosis via Elevated Levels of Reactive Oxygen Species in Human Lung Cancer Cells.', 'Mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane: Overview and inextricable link with cancer.', 'The endoplasmic reticulum stress response in prostate cancer.', 'JI017 Attenuates Oxaliplatin-Induced Cold Allodynia via Spinal TRPV1 and Astrocytes Inhibition in Mice.']"""

In turn, OS decreases sperm functional integrity, increases sperm DNA damage and ultimately alters fertility status. To elucidate the impact of leukocytospermia on sperm nuclear DNA integrity and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) structure, we conducted a study including 67 samples from infertile patients with low level of leucocytes (Group 1: n = 20) and with leukocytospermia (Group 2: n = 47). In addition to standard sperm parameters' assessment, we measured the levels of inflammation biomarkers [interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8)] and evaluated the oxidative status [malondialdehyde (MDA) and enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants]. In addition, we evaluated the level of sperm nuclear DNA fragmentation and analysed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of sperm cells by sequencing of 5 genes [cytochrome oxidase I (COXI), cytochrome oxidase II (COXII), cytochrome oxidase III (COXIII), adenosine triphosphate synthase 6 (ATPase 6) and adenosine triphosphate synthase 8 (ATPase 8)]. As expected, patients with leukocytospermia had significantly higher MDA levels (32.56 ± 24.30 nmole/ml) than patients without leukocytospermia (17.59 ± 9.60 nmole/ml) (p < .018). Also, sperm DNA fragmentation index (DFI) was significantly higher in Group 2 (33.05 ± 18.14%) as compared to Group 1 (14.19 ± 9.50%) (p < .001). The sequencing of mtDNA revealed a high number of substitutions in Group 2 (n = 102) compared to Group 1 (n = 5). These substitutions were observed mainly in COXI. Among COXI substitutions found in Group 2, twelve changes were previously described in patients with prostate cancer and six of them were shown associated with this pathology. These findings suggest that leukocytospermia may predispose to the manifestation of prostate cancer through modification of mitochondrial DNA and this may be promoted by OS.""","""['Rihab Derbel', 'Hanen Sellami', 'Ahmed Rebai', 'Radhouane Gdoura', 'Elreavy Mcelreavey', 'Leila Ammar-Keskes']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Andrologia""","""['Relationship between nuclear DNA fragmentation, mitochondrial DNA damage and standard sperm parameters in spermatozoa of infertile patients with leukocytospermia.', 'Reactive oxygen species and sperm DNA damage in infertile men presenting with low level leukocytospermia.', 'Effect of leukocytospermia and processing by discontinuous density gradient on sperm nuclear DNA fragmentation and mitochondrial activity.', 'Causes and consequences of sperm mitochondrial dysfunction.', 'Sperm Mitochondria, the Driving Force Behind Human Spermatozoa Activities: Its Functions and Dysfunctions - A Narrative Review.']"""

Nevertheless, there are still barriers. We aimed to identify the key areas by systematically surveying urology departments in Germany and Austria. A 27-question survey on the adoption of ERAS principles for the perioperative care of RARP patients was designed, in compliance with the guidelines on good practice in conducting and reporting of survey research. After positive testing for face and content validity, the survey was distributed via postal mail to 82 departments performing RARP. In total, 39 departments responded to our survey (response rate 48%). The ERAS adoption rates ranged from 21 to 97%, with nine ERAS principles being widely adopted (72-92% of the departments). The lowest adoption rates and, subsequently, the largest potential for optimization were detected for the preoperative nutrition counselling (21%), preoperative pelvic floor physiotherapy (54%), postoperative early initiation of nutrition (44%) and postoperative patient audit for further quality improvement (36%). High-volume centers performed more frequently a perioperative nutrition counselling (8/27; 30%) than low-volume centers (0/12; 0%; p = 0.036). The implementation of the ERAS principles into the perioperative care algorithm were medium-to-high, yet not optimal.

Patients and methods:   From December 2017 to November 2019, consecutive patients who underwent Rezūm™ and Urolift™ procedures in two urology centers have been retrospectively considered. Only patients with a prostate size less than 80 mL were included. We used the PSM method to adjust baseline differences between both groups. The co-primary endpoint included the change in International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and IPSS- quality of life (QoL) from baseline to 12 months.  Results:   A total of 61 (52.1%) and 56 (47.9%) patients underwent Rezum™ and Urolift™ procedures, respectively. After PSM adjustment, 24 patients were included in both groups. No serious adverse events occurred (> Clavien II) in both groups. At 12 months, higher IPSS improvement was observed in the Rezum™ group (median:4 [IQR 3-5]) than in the Urolift™ group (median:8 [IQR 7-12]), without statistical difference (p = 0.08). The improvement in term of QoL at 12 m was similar (p = 0.43). The retreatment rates were 25% (Urolift™) and 8.3% (Rezum™), p = 0.24. Erection and ejaculatory function scores did not change significantly in either treatment group. Results in the full cohort showed that Rezum™ appeared to deliver greater improvements for IPSS and IPSS-QoL (p < 0.001 and p = 0.006, respectively) and lower reintervention rate (p = 0.006) than Urolift™.  Conclusions:   In this small retrospective study, our results indicate that both Rezum™ and Urolift™ provide a clinically significant improvement in symptoms and QoL, although some of these improvements were greater in the Rezum™ arm.

Methods:   We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (SEER-MHOS) linked data resource to characterize fatigue trajectories and their predictors 1214 older adult survivors of breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer. Fatigue was measured prior to the cancer diagnosis (T0) and at two timepoints after diagnosis (T1: mean = 20 months and T2: mean = 39 months post-diagnosis). Latent growth curve modeling and mixed effects models for repeated measurements were used to investigate fatigue experiences before and after a cancer diagnosis.  Results:   Overall, mean fatigue T-scores declined (T0 = 50, T1 = 46, and T2 = 45) indicating worsening fatigue over time. Four latent trajectory subgroups were identified: severe fatigue worsening over time (8.2% of sample), severe fatigue persisting over time (14.4%), no fatigue pre-diagnosis and mild fatigue post-diagnosis (44.4%), and not fatigued (33%). Age, cancer stage, comorbidities, and depressed mood predicted membership in the two trajectory groups experiencing severe fatigue that persisted or that worsened post-diagnosis. Older age, advanced cancer stage at diagnosis, and depressed mood were significantly associated with worsening fatigue from T1 to T2 (all p < 0.0001).

Materials and methods:   Thirty-two patients with biopsy-proven PCa were recruited for MRI examination (n = 16 scanned at 1.5 T, n = 16 scanned at 3 T). Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with 13 b values (b = 0 to 2000 s/mm2 up to 3 averages, 1.5 T: TR = 5.774 s, TE = 81 ms and 3 T: TR = 4.899 s, TE = 100 ms), T2-weighted, and T1-weighted imaging were used on the 1.5 T and 3 T MRI scanner, respectively. The IVIM-DKI signal was modeled using the traditional IVIM-DKI model and a novel model in which the total variation (TV) penalty function was combined with the traditional model to optimize non-physiological variations. Paired and unpaired t-tests were used to compare intra-scanner and scanner group differences in IVIM-DKI parameters obtained using the novel and the traditional models. Analysis of variance with post hoc test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were used to assess the ability of parameters obtained using the novel model (at 1.5 T) and the traditional model (at 3 T) to characterize prostate lesions.  Results:   IVIM-DKI modeled using novel model with TV spatial penalty function at 1.5 T, produced parameter maps with 50-78% lower coefficient of variation (CV) than traditional model at 3 T. Novel model estimated higher D with lower D*, f and k values at both field strengths compared to traditional model. For scanner differences, the novel model at 1.5 T estimated lower D* and f values as compared to traditional model at 3 T. At 1.5 T, D and f values were significantly lower with k values significantly higher in tumor than BPH and healthy tissue. D (AUC: 0.98), f (AUC: 0.82), and k (AUC: 0.91) parameters estimated using novel model showed high diagnostic performance in cancer lesion detection at 1.5 T.

The 5-year BCR-free survival was assessed by univariable Kaplan-Meier analyses and log-rank test. Multivariable Cox regression models tested the independent association of each model for BCR. Performance of both models to predict 5-year BCR-free survival was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC).  Results:   The 2768 patients included were treated with high dose rate brachytherapy (13.3%) as a boost to external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), low dose rate seed brachytherapy (50.4%) or EBRT alone (35.9%). 14.4% of patients received concomitant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). 222 patients experienced BCR (8%), with a median follow-up of 56 months.

Radiotherapy during ADT might act synergistically and further worsen body composition. Previous investigations have shown that resistance training is an effective method of preserving body composition during ADT, however, most have not accounted for direct or indirect effects of other therapies, such as radiotherapy. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine training adaptations of the tissue composition in patients receiving radiation therapy (RT) prior or during ADT.  Methods:   Analyses were performed by combining data from two previous trials for a total of 131 prostate cancer patients who underwent a combination of resistance and aerobic exercise training (N = 70, age: 68.9 ± 6.6y, RT-before: 13%, RT-during: 14%) or usual care (N = 61, age: 67.5 ± 7.9y, RT-before: 16%, RT-during: 20%) for 3 months upon ADT onset. Whole-body lean mass (LM), fat percentage and appendicular LM were determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, and lower-leg muscle area and density by peripheral computed tomography at baseline (onset of ADT) and at 3 months post-intervention. Covariates included RT prior and during the intervention, demographic characteristics, physical symptoms, and chronic conditions.  Results:   Radiotherapy before or during the intervention did not affect body composition. Only the usual care group experienced a significant decrease in whole-body LM (-994 ± 150 g, P < 0.001) and appendicular LM (-126 ± 19 g, P < 0.001), and an increase in whole-body fat percentage (1% ± 0.1%, P < 0.001).

However, the role of lncRNAs in the regulation of antimony-induced carcinogenesis remains unknown, and the precise mechanisms need to be explored. In the present study, we found that chronic exposure to antimony promoted cell growth and lipid metabolic disequilibrium in prostate cancer. Mechanistically, we identified a long noncoding RNA molecule, PCA3, that was substantially upregulated in LNCaP cells in response to long-term antimony exposure. Functional studies indicated that abnormal PCA3 expression modulated antimony-induced proliferation and cellular triglyceride and cholesterol levels. In addition, PCA3 levels were found to be inversely correlated with MIR-132-3 P levels by acting as a decoy for MIR-132-3P. Besides, SREBP1 directly interacted with MIR-132-3 P to increase cell growth and disrupt lipid metabolism by targeting its 3'UTR regions.

Besides, whether long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the regulation of prolonged exposure to Cd in PCa needs to be elucidated. In the present study, we found that the serum concentration of Cd in PCa patients was positively correlated with the Gleason score and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification. To simulate chronic Cd exposure in PCa, we subjected PC3 and DU145 cells to long-term, low-dose Cd exposure and further examined tumor behavior. Functional studies identified that chronic Cd exposure promoted cell growth and ferroptosis resistance in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we found that lncRNA OIP5-AS1 expression was greatly elevated in PC3 and DU145 cells upon chronic Cd exposure. Dysregulation of OIP5-AS1 expression mediated cell growth and Cd-induced ferroptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that OIP5-AS1 served as an endogenous sponge of miR-128-3p to regulate the expression of SLC7A11, a surrogate marker of ferroptosis.

Although new drugs for treating prostate cancer continue to emerge, the unclear mechanism underlying drug targets limits this therapy, thereby constraining identification of effective therapeutic targets. Although GDP dissociation inhibitor 2(GDI2) is highly expressed and closely associated with occurrence and development of many tumors, its role in prostate cancer remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of GDI2 and elucidated its underlying mechanism of action in prostate cancer. Moreover, we screened chemotherapeutic drugs that affect GDI2 expression with a view of identifying novel targets for diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.  Methods:   We performed sequence analyses and functional assays to precisely elucidate the GDI2 role in prostate cancer. Moreover, we induced tumorigenesis in nude mice to verify the role of GDI2 in vivo. Finally, we used the CCK8 assay to ascertain the most suitable IC50 across the three drugs and performed quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western Blot to analyze the effects of drugs on expression of GDI2, p75NTR, and p-NFκB.  Results:   GDI2 was up-regulated in prostate cancer cells and tissues. Knocking down GDI2 suppressed cell proliferation but promoted cell apoptosis. Interestingly, knocking down GDI2 activated the p75NTR signaling pathway, indicating, for the first time, that p75NTR is negatively correlated with GDI2 expression.  Conclusion:   Taken together, these results indicate that GDI2 is a therapeutic target of paclitaxel. Knocking down of GDI2 inhibits cell proliferation and promotes cell apoptosis via the p75NTR signaling pathway in prostate cancer.

Currently, these plans are prepared manually by experts incorporating the centre's planning style and guidelines. In this article, we develop a novel framework that can learn a centre's planning strategy and automatically reproduce rapid clinically acceptable plans.  Methods:   The proposed framework is based on conditional generative adversarial networks that learn our centre's planning style using a pool of 931 historical LDR-PB planning data. Two additional losses that help constrain prohibited needle patterns and produce similar-looking plans are also proposed. Once trained, this model generates an initial distribution of needles which is passed to a planner. The planner then initializes the sources based on the predicted needles and uses a simulated annealing algorithm to optimize their locations further.  Results:   Quantitative analysis was carried out on 170 cases which showed the generated plans having similar dosimetry to that of the manual plans but with significantly lower planning durations. Indeed, on the test cases, the clinical target volumes achieving [Formula: see text] of the prescribed dose for the generated plans was on average [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text] for manual plans) with an average planning time of [Formula: see text] min ([Formula: see text] min for manual plans). Further qualitative analysis was conducted by an expert planner who accepted [Formula: see text] of the plans with some changes ([Formula: see text] requiring minor changes & [Formula: see text] requiring major changes).  Conclusion:   The proposed framework demonstrated the ability to rapidly generate quality treatment plans that not only fulfil the dosimetric requirements but also takes into account the centre's planning style.

Abnormal expression and altered activity of MMPs result in excessive extracellular matrix degradation and increased tumor metastasis in various cancers. Small leucine zipper protein (sLZIP), belonging to the leucine zipper transcription factor family, functions as a transcriptional regulator of genes involved in various cellular processes. However, its role in MMP expression and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) metastasis remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of sLZIP in MMP-13 expression and its involvement in CRPC metastasis. sLZIP increased MMP-13 transcription by directly binding to its promoter in CRPC cells. We found that the expression levels of glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which represses MMP transcription, were elevated in CRPC cells. However, sLZIP suppressed the inhibitory effect of GR and enhanced the secretion of MMP-13 in CRPC cells. sLZIP promoted cell migration and invasion; however, a specific MMP-13 inhibitor blocked sLZIP-induced cell motility. Depletion of sLZIP using the CRISPR/Cas9 system downregulated MMP-13 messenger RNA expression in PC3 cells. Mice injected with sLZIP-depleted PC3 cells showed significantly reduced metastatic tumor volume in the lung compared with mice injected with control PC3 cells. Our findings suggest that sLZIP plays an important role in MMP-13 induction and CRPC metastasis.

Of these, 356 had positive findings and were stratified by quintiles into a very low (quintile 1, ≤25 cm3), low (quintile 2, 25-189 cm3), moderate (quintile 3, 189-532 cm3), high (quintile 4, 532-1,355 cm3), or very high (quintile 5, ≥1,355 cm3) total PSMA-positive tumor volume (PSMA-VOL). PSMA-VOL was obtained by semiautomatic segmentation of total tumor lesions using qPSMA software. Fifty prostate cancer patients with no PSMA-positive lesions (negative scan) served as a control group. Normal organs, which included salivary glands, liver, spleen, and kidneys, were semiautomatically segmented using 68Ga-PSMA PET images, and SUVmean was obtained. Correlations between the SUVmean of normal organs and PSMA-VOL as continuous and categoric variables by quintiles were evaluated. Results: The median PSMA-VOL was 302 cm3 (interquartile range [IQR], 47-1,076 cm3). The median SUVmean of salivary glands, kidneys, liver, and spleen was 10.0 (IQR, 7.7-11.8), 26.0 (IQR, 20.0-33.4), 3.7 (IQR, 3.0-4.7), and 5.3 (IQR, 4.0-7.2), respectively. PSMA-VOL showed a moderate negative correlation with the SUVmean of the salivary glands (r = -0.44, P < 0.001), kidneys (r = -0.34, P < 0.001), and liver (r = -0.30, P < 0.001) and a weak negative correlation with the spleen SUVmean (r = -0.16, P = 0.002). Patients with a very high PSMA-VOL (quintile 5, ≥1,355 cm3) had a significantly lower PSMA uptake in the salivary glands, kidneys, liver, and spleen than did the control group, with an average difference of -38.1%, -40.0%, -43.2%, and -34.9%, respectively (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Tumor sequestration affects 68Ga-PSMA biodistribution in normal organs. Patients with a very high tumor load showed a significantly lower uptake of 68Ga-PSMA in normal organs, confirming a tumor sink effect. As similar effects might occur with PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy, these patients might benefit from increased therapeutic activity without exceeding the radiation dose limit for organs at risk.""","""['Andrei Gafita', 'Hui Wang', 'Andrew Robertson', 'Wesley R Armstrong', 'Raphael Zaum', 'Manuel Weber', 'Farid Yagubbayli', 'Clemens Kratochwil', 'Tristan R Grogan', 'Kathleen Nguyen', 'Fernando Navarro', 'Rouzbeh Esfandiari', 'Isabel Rauscher', 'Bjoern Menze', 'David Elashoff', 'Ebrahim S Delpassand', 'Ken Herrmann', 'Johannes Czernin', 'Michael S Hofman', 'Jeremie Calais', 'Wolfgang P Fendler', 'Matthias Eiber']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Thoughts on ""Tumor Sink Effect in 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET: Myth or Reality?"".', 'Tumor Sink Effect: Myth or Reality?', 'Correlation of Lesional Uptake Parameters and Ratios with miPSMA Score and Estimating Normal Physiologic Concentration: An Exploratory Analysis in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostatic Carcinoma Patients with 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT.', 'The Impact of Monosodium Glutamate on 68Ga-PSMA-11 Biodistribution in Men with Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Randomized, Controlled Imaging Study.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'qPSMA: Semiautomatic Software for Whole-Body Tumor Burden Assessment in Prostate Cancer Using 68Ga-PSMA11 PET/CT.', '68Ga-prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) for primary staging of high-risk prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Safety of Lutetium-177 prostate-specific membrane antigen-617 (PSMA-617) radioligand therapy in the setting of severe renal impairment: a case report and literature review.', 'Lymphoma-Sink Effect in Marginal Zone Lymphoma Based on CXCR4-Targeted Molecular Imaging.', 'Optimizing the Safety and Efficacy of Bio-Radiopharmaceuticals for Cancer Therapy.', 'Tumor Sink Effect with Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Targeted Theranostics in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Intra-Individual Evaluations.', '177Lu-DOTATATE Theranostics: Predicting Renal Dosimetry From Pretherapy 68Ga-DOTATATE PET and Clinical Biomarkers.']"""

This work introduces an automated platform, aPROMISE, to implement and extend the Prostate Cancer Molecular Imaging Standardized Evaluation (PROMISE) criteria. The objective is to validate the performance of aPROMISE in staging and quantifying disease burden in patients with prostate cancer who undergo prostate-specific antigen (PSMA) imaging. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of 109 veterans with intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer who underwent PSMA imaging. To validate the performance of aPROMISE, 2 independent nuclear medicine physicians conducted aPROMISE-assisted reads, resulting in standardized reports that quantify individual lesions and stage the patients. Patients were staged as having local disease only (miN0M0), regional lymph node disease only (miN1M0), metastatic disease only (miN0M1), or both regional and distant metastatic disease (miN1M1). The staging obtained from aPROMISE-assisted reads was compared with the staging by conventional imaging. Cohen pairwise κ-agreement was used to evaluate interreader variability. Correlation coefficients and intraclass correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the interreader variability of the quantitative assessment (molecular imaging PSMA [miPSMA] index) at each stage. Kendall tau and t testing were used to evaluate the association of miPSMA index with prostate-specific antigen and Gleason score. Results: All PSMA images of 109 veterans met the DICOM conformity and the requirements for the aPROMISE analysis. Both independent aPROMISE-assisted analyses demonstrated significant upstaging in patients with localized (23%, n = 20/87) and regional (25%, n = 2/8) tumor burden. However, a significant number of patients with bone metastases identified on conventional imaging (18F-NaF PET/CT) were downstaged (29%, n = 4/14). The comparison of the 2 independent aPROMISE-assisted reads demonstrated a high κ-agreement: 0.82 for miN0M0, 0.90 for miN1M0, and 0.77 for miN0M1. The Spearman correlation of quantitative miPSMA index was 0.93, 0.96, and 0.97, respectively. As a continuous variable, miPSMA index in the prostate was associated with risk groups defined by prostate-specific antigen and Gleason score. Conclusion: We demonstrated the consistency of the aPROMISE platform between readers and observed substantial upstaging in PSMA imaging compared with conventional imaging. aPROMISE may contribute to broader standardization of PSMA imaging assessment and to its clinical utility in the management of prostate cancer patients.""","""['Nicholas Nickols', 'Aseem Anand', 'Kerstin Johnsson', 'Johan Brynolfsson', 'Pablo Borreli', 'Neil Parikh', 'Jesus Juarez', 'Lida Jafari', 'Mattias Eiber', 'Matthew Rettig']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Analytical performance of aPROMISE: automated anatomic contextualization, detection, and quantification of 18FDCFPyL (PSMA) imaging for standardized reporting.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'PSMA-Based (18)FDCFPyL PET/CT Is Superior to Conventional Imaging for Lesion Detection in Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Second Version of the Prostate Cancer Molecular Imaging Standardized Evaluation Framework Including Response Evaluation for Clinical Trials (PROMISE\xa0V2).', '18FDCFPyL PET/CT for Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', 'Modified PROMISE criteria for standardized interpretation of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR)-targeted PET.', 'Response Evaluation Criteria in PSMA PET/CT (RECIP 1.0) in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Future of prostate imaging: Artificial intelligence in assessing prostatic magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Quantitative assessment of PSMA PET response to therapy in castration-sensitive prostate cancer using an automated imaging platform for disease identification and measurement.', 'Modeling contrast-to-noise ratio from list mode reconstructions of 68Ga DOTATATE PET/CT: predicting detectability of hepatic metastases in shorter acquisition PET reconstructions.']"""

We re-analyze multiple pancreas and PDAC single-cell RNA-seq datasets and find a subset of nonmalignant acinar cells, which we refer to as acinar edge (AE) cells, whose transcriptomes highly diverge from a typical acinar cell in each dataset. Genes upregulated among AE cells are enriched for transcriptomic signatures of pancreatic progenitors, acinar dedifferentiation, and several oncogenic programs. AE-upregulated genes are upregulated in human PDAC tumors, and consistently, their promoters are hypomethylated. High expression of these genes is associated with poor patient survival. The fraction of AE-like cells increases with age in healthy pancreatic tissue, which is not explained by clonal mutations, thus pointing to a nongenetic source of variation. The fraction of AE-like cells is also significantly higher in human pancreatitis samples. Finally, we find edge-like states in lung, liver, prostate, and colon tissues, suggesting that subpopulations of healthy cells across tissues can exist in pre-neoplastic states.

Here, we showed that MI inhibited cell proliferation with G0/1 phase cell cycle arrest in colon cancer cells. Moreover, it was observed that MI increased apoptosis compared to untreated cells. Further investigation showed that the SUMOylation of c-Myc was enhanced by MI and led to the down-regulated protein level of c-Myc, which is involved in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. SENP1 has been demonstrated to be critical for the SUMOylation of c-Myc. Meanwhile, knockdown of SENP1 by siRNA abolished the effects of MI on c-Myc level and cell viability in colon cancer cells.

Whether all high risk patients benefit from BT to the same extent is unknown. The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was used to investigate overall survival (OS) differences between GS 8 and 9-10 treated with external beam radiation (EBRT) only or BT +/- EBRT.  Materials and methods:   We included localized prostate adenocarcinoma definitively treated with radiation between 2004-2014. Patients were stratified into various radiation treatment groups: EBRT 7560 - 8640 cGy, EBRT 5940 - 7540 cGy, and BT +/- EBRT. All EBRT only and BT +/- EBRT patients received ADT. A multivariable Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess OS. Propensity score matching was used to account for differences between groups. Median survival was determined based on Kaplan-Meier survival curves.  Results:   30,698 patients were included. On multivariable analysis among GS 8 patients, BT was associated with improved OS compared to 7560 - 8640 cGy (HR-0.80 (95% CI 0.70-0.92, P = 0.002). In Gleason 9-10 BT did not result in improved OS compared to 7560 - 8640 cGy (HR- 0.91 (95% CI 0.79 - 1.05, P = 0.212). Results remained significant with propensity score matching and removing patients with medical comorbidities.  Conclusion:   BT was associated with improved OS when compared to 7560 - 8640 cGy in GS 8, but not in Gleason 9-10 disease. This hypothesis generating study suggests there may be variable benefit with BT in high risk prostate cancer patients on OS. Future prospective studies are needed to investigate whether the benefit of BT is similar across all high risk prostate cancer patients.""","""['John David', 'Michael Luu', 'Diana Lu', 'Zachary S Zumsteg', 'Howard Sandler', 'Mitchell Kamrava']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Overall survival comparison between androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) plus external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) vs ADT plus EBRT with brachytherapy boost in clinically node-positive prostate cancer.', 'Ten-year survival after High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy combined with External Beam Radiation Therapy in high-risk prostate cancer: A comparison with the Norwegian SPCG-7 cohort.', 'Prostate-only Versus Whole-pelvis Radiation with or Without a Brachytherapy Boost for Gleason Grade Group 5 Prostate Cancer: A Retrospective Analysis.', 'Permanent interstitial low-dose-rate brachytherapy for patients with localised prostate cancer: a systematic review of randomised and nonrandomised controlled clinical trials.', 'Radiation therapy compared to radical prostatectomy as first-line definitive therapy for patients with high-risk localised prostate cancer: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

We aimed to determine if multi-parametric quantitative parameters, in addition to clinical factors, might have a role in independently predicting focal salvage HIFU outcomes.  Methods:   A retrospective registry analysis included 150 consecutive men who underwent focal salvage HIFU (Sonablate500) (2006-2015); 89 had mpMRI available. Metastatic disease was excluded by nodal assessment on pelvic MRI, a radioisotope bone-scan and/or choline or FDG PET/CT scan. All men had mpMRI and either transperineal template prostate mapping biopsy or targeted and systematic TRUS-biopsy. mpMRI included T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhancement. Pre-HIFU quantitative mpMRI data was obtained using Horos DICOM Viewer v3.3.5 for general MRI parameters and IB DCE v2.0 plug-in. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined by biochemical failure and/or positive localized or distant imaging results and/or positive biopsy and/or systemic therapy and/or metastases/prostate cancer-specific death. Potential predictors of PFS were analyzed by univariable and multivariable Cox-regression.  Results:   Median age at focal salvage HIFU was 71 years (interquartile range [IQR] 65-74.5) and median PSA pre-focal salvage treatment was 5.8ng/ml (3.8-8). Median follow-up was 35 months (23-47) and median time to failure was 15 months (7.8-24.3). D-Amico low, intermediate and high-risk disease was present in 1% (1/89), 40% (36/89) and 43% (38/89) prior to focal salvage HIFU (16% missing data). 56% (50/89) failed by the composite outcome. A total of 22 factors were evaluated on univariable and 8 factors on multivariable analysis. The following quantitative parameters were included: Ktrans, Kep, Ve, Vp, IS, rTTP and TTP. On univariable analysis, PSA, prostate volume at time of radiotherapy failure and Ve (median) value were predictors for failure. Ve represents extracellular fraction of the whole tissue volume. On multivariable analysis, only Ve (median) value remained as an independent predictor.  Conclusions:   One pharmacokinetic quantitative parameter based on DCE sequences seems to independently predict failure following focal salvage HIFU for radio-recurrent prostate cancer. This likely relates to the tumor microenvironment producing heat-sinks which counter the heating effect of HIFU.

Materials and methods:   In this retrospective study, biparametric (T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted) prostate MRI acquired with multiple 1.5-T and 3.0-T MRI scanners in consecutive men was used for training and testing of prostate segmentation and lesion detection networks. Ground truth was the combination of targeted and extended systematic MRI-transrectal ultrasound fusion biopsies, with significant prostate cancer defined as International Society of Urological Pathology grade group greater than or equal to 2. U-Nets were internally validated on full, reduced, and PROSTATEx-enhanced training sets and subsequently externally validated on the institutional test set and the PROSTATEx test set. U-Net segmentation was calibrated to clinically desired levels in cross-validation, and test performance was subsequently compared using sensitivities, specificities, predictive values, and Dice coefficient.  Results:   One thousand four hundred eighty-eight institutional examinations (median age, 64 years; interquartile range, 58-70 years) were temporally split into training (2014-2017, 806 examinations, supplemented by 204 PROSTATEx examinations) and test (2018-2020, 682 examinations) sets.

Here, we built a PLNM-Risk calculator to obtain a precisely informed decision about whether to perform extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND).  Methods:   The PLNM-Risk calculator was developed in 280 patients and verified internally in 71 patients and externally in 50 patients by integrating a set of radiologists' interpretations, clinicopathological factors and newly refined imaging indicators from MR images with radiomics machine learning and deep transfer learning algorithms. Its clinical applicability was compared with Briganti and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) nomograms.  Findings:   The PLNM-Risk achieved good diagnostic discrimination with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90-0.96), 0.92 (95% CI, 0.84-0.97) and 0.76 (95% CI, 0.62-0.87) in the training/validation, internal test and external test cohorts, respectively. If the number of ePLNDs missed was controlled at < 2%, PLNM-Risk provided both a higher number of ePLNDs spared (PLNM-Risk 59.6% vs MSKCC 44.9% vs Briganti 38.9%) and a lower number of false positives (PLNM-Risk 59.3% vs MSKCC 70.1% and Briganti 72.7%). In follow-up, patients stratified by the PLNM-Risk calculator showed significantly different biochemical recurrence rates after surgery.

Technological improvements have recently allowed transperineal biopsy to be effectively integrated into outpatient practices with negligible risk of infection.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed a cohort of men undergoing transperineal prostate biopsy from 2018-2020, at a single institution. We compared this to another cohort of men undergoing transrectal fusion biopsy from 2014-2018, matched to the first cohort based on age, PSA, and presence of prostate cancer diagnosis prior to biopsy. All patients underwent systematic transperineal templated biopsies in addition to fusion biopsies of MRI-visible lesions. Baseline characteristics, MRI findings, biopsy results, and complications were analyzed and compared between the 2 groups.  Results:   One-hundred and thirty men underwent transperineal prostate biopsy, and 130 men underwent transrectal fusion biopsy. Of those who underwent transperineal biopsy, 30% underwent fusion biopsy while all men with the transrectal biopsy underwent fusion biopsy. Men who underwent transperineal vs transrectal biopsy demonstrated lower infection rates (0% vs 0.8%, P = .31) with fewer prophylactic antibiotics prescribed at provider's discretion (48% vs 100%), yet higher total post-biopsy complication rates (6.1% vs 0.8%, P = .036).  Conclusion:   Our initial experiences with transperineal prostate biopsy confirm prior findings demonstrating feasibility in outpatient urologic practice without infectious complication. Software-assisted MRI/US fusion technology can be successfully integrated with transperineal biopsies to target suspicious lesions. Higher rates of non-infectious complications were observed compared with transrectal biopsy.

IL-13 may contribute to the disease outcomes by increasing eosinophil infiltration thereby promoting fibrosis. IL-13 may act as an immunosuppressive inflammatory cytokine that may promote carcinogenesis and also may offer protection against schistosomiasis thereby reducing risk of schistosome infections. Our study evaluated the frequency of the IL-13 rs1800925/-1112 C/ T promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among schistosomiasis infected individuals and assessed the association of the variants on IL-13 cytokine levels. We also investigated IL-13 rs1800925 polymorphisms on prostate-specific antigen levels as an indicator for risk of prostate cancer development.  Methodology:   The study was cross-sectional and included 50 schistosomiasis infected and 316 uninfected male participants residing in Murehwa District, Zimbabwe. IL-13 rs1800925 SNPs were genotyped by allele amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction. Concentrations of serum prostate-specific antigens and plasma IL-13 were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.  Results:   Frequencies of the genotypes CC, CT and TT, were 20%, 58% and 22% in schistosomiasis infected, and 18.3%, 62.1% and 19.6% in uninfected participants with no statistical differences. There were significantly (p<0.05) higher IL-13 cytokine levels among both infected and uninfected participants with the genotypes CC and CT; median 92.25 pg/mL and 106.5 pg/mL, respectively, compared to TT variant individuals; 44.78 pg/mL. Within the schistosomiasis uninfected group, CC and CT variants had significantly (p<0.05) higher IL-13 levels; median 135.0 pg/mL and 113.6 pg/mL, respectively compared to TT variant individuals; 47.15 pg/mL. Within the schistosomiasis infected group, CC, CT and TT variant individuals had insignificant differences of IL-13 level. Using logistic regression, no association was observed between prostate-specific antigen levels, IL-13 cytokine levels and IL-13 rs1800925 variants (p>0.05).  Conclusion:   IL-13 rs1800925 C variant individuals had the highest IL-13 cytokine levels among the schistosomiasis uninfected suggesting that they may be protective against Schistosoma infections. There was no association between IL-13 concentrations or IL-13 rs1800925 variants and risk of prostate cancer indicating that IL-13 levels and IL-13 rs10800925 may not be utilised as biomarker for risk of prostate cancer in schistosome infections.""","""['Emilia T Choto', 'Takafira Mduluza', 'Moses J Chimbari']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Interleukin-4 and STAT6 promoter polymorphisms but not interleukin-10 or 13 are essential for schistosomiasis and associated disease burden among Nigerian children.', 'An IL-13 promoter polymorphism associated with liver fibrosis in patients with Schistosoma japonicum.', 'Lack of association of IL-10 (rs1800896) and IL-13 (rs1800925) with non-segmental vitiligo susceptibility in South Indian population.', 'Association of the SNP rs1800925(C/T) in the interleukin-13 gene promoter with pulmonary function in Chinese Han patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.', 'Association of schistosomiasis and risk of prostate cancer development in residents of Murehwa rural community, Zimbabwe.', 'Association between polymorphisms of IL4, IL13, IL10, STAT6 and IFNG genes, cytokines and immunoglobulin E levels with high burden of Schistosoma mansoni in children from schistosomiasis endemic areas of Cameroon.', 'A cervical cancer biorepository for pharmacogenomics research in Zimbabwe.', 'Frequency distribution of cytokine and associated transcription factor single nucleotide polymorphisms in Zimbabweans: Impact on schistosome infection and cytokine levels.']"""

Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC)-derived area under the curve analysis was performed to evaluate the predictive accuracy. In addition, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was carried out to determine the association between RDW and csPCa detection.  Results:   A total of 89 patients were diagnosed with csPCa, and these patients presented with higher median RDW. The optimal RDW cut-off was set at 12.35%, which gained the maximal Yuden's index. In addition to csPCa, RDW demonstrated a positive correlation with age (r = 0.210, P < 0.001). It was observed that RDW was independent of prostate-specific antigen density for csPCa detection. Compared with the low-RDW group, patients in the high-RDW group had a 1.586-fold increased risk of being diagnosed with csPCa (OR = 2.586, P = 0.007). In the ROC analysis, the accuracy level increased by 3.1% for the prediction of csPCa, when RDW was added to the multivariate logistic model.  Conclusion:   A high-RDW value is an independent risk factor for csPCa detection. However, more large-scale studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Increasing the early diagnosis and definitive treatment of cancer among unmarried patients may reduce the survival gap.  Objectives:   To evaluate the extent to which marriage is associated with cancer-specific survival, stage at diagnosis, and treatment among patients with 9 common solid cancers and to recommend methods for reducing the survival gap.  Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective, population-based cohort study included patients older than 18 years who were diagnosed with 1 of 9 common cancers between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2016. Patient data were retrieved from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. Statistical analyses were performed from August 1 to October 1, 2020.  Exposures:   Marital status, classified as married and unmarried (including single, separated, divorced, widowed, and unmarried patients or domestic partners).  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcome was the time ratio (TR) of cancer-specific survival (married vs unmarried). Mediation analyses were conducted to determine the extent to which the association of marriage with cancer-specific survival was mediated by stage at diagnosis and treatment.  Results:   This study included 1 733 906 patients (894 379 [51.6%] women; 1 067 726 [61.6%] married; mean [SD] age, 63.76 [12.60] years). Multivariate analyses found that those who were married were associated with better cancer-specific survival than unmarried patients (TR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.35-1.37). Early diagnosis in breast cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, and melanoma mediated the association between marital status and cancer-specific survival (breast cancer: proportion mediated [PM], 11.4%; 95% CI, 11.2%-11.6%; colorectal cancer: PM, 10.9%; 95% CI, 10.7%-11.2%; endometrial cancer: PM, 12.9%; 95% CI, 12.5%-13.3%; melanoma: PM, 12.0%; 95% CI, 11.7-12.4%). Surgery mediated the association between marital status and cancer-specific survival in lung (PM, 52.2%; 95% CI, 51.9%-52.4%), pancreatic (PM, 28.9%; 95% CI, 28.6%-29.3%), and prostate (PM, 39.3%; 95% CI, 39.0%-39.6%) cancers. Chemotherapy mediated the association of marital status with cancer-specific survival in lung (PM, 37.7%; 95% CI, 37.6%-37.9%) and pancreatic (PM, 28.6%; 95% CI, 28.4%-28.9%) cancers. Improved cancer-specific survival associated with marriage was greater among men than women (men: TR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.25-1.28; women: TR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.19-1.21). The contribution of receiving an early diagnosis and treatment with surgery or chemotherapy to the association between marital status and cancer-specific survival was greater among men than women (early diagnosis: PM, 21.7% [95% CI, 21.5%-21.9%] vs PM, 20.3% [95% CI, 20.2%-20.4%]; surgery: PM, 26.6% [95% CI, 26.4%-26.7%] vs PM, 11.1% [95% CI, 11.0%-11.2%]; chemotherapy: PM, 6.8% [95% CI, 6.7%-6.8%] vs PM, 5.1% [95% CI, 5.0%-5.2%]).  Conclusions and relevance:   In this study, survival disparities associated with marital status were attributable to early diagnosis in breast, colorectal, and endometrial cancers as well as melanoma and to treatment-related variables in lung, pancreatic, and prostate cancers.

Development of optimal PACA nanocarriers requires detailed analysis of the overall cellular impact exerted by PACA variants. We here perform a comprehensive comparison of cabazitaxel (CBZ)-loaded nanocarriers composed of three different PACA monomers, i.e. poly(n-butyl cyanoacrylate) (PBCA), poly(2-ethylbutyl cyanoacrylate) (PEBCA) and poly(octyl cyanoacrylate) (POCA). The cytotoxicity of drug-loaded and empty PACA nanoparticles were compared to that of free CBZ across a panel of nine cancer cell lines by assessing cellular metabolism, proliferation and protein synthesis. The analyses revealed that the cytotoxicity of all CBZ-loaded PACAs was similar to that of free CBZ for all cell lines tested, whereas the empty PACAs exerted much lower toxicity. To increase our understanding of the toxic effects of these treatments comprehensive MS-based proteomics were performed with HCT116, MDA-MB-231 and PC3 cells incubated with PACA-CBZ variants or free CBZ. Interestingly, PACA-CBZ specifically led to decreased levels of proteins involved in focal adhesion and stress fibers in all cell lines. Since we recently demonstrated that encapsulation of CBZ within PEBCA nanoparticles significantly improved the therapeutic effect of CBZ on a patient derived xenograft model in mice, we investigated the effects of this PACA variant more closely by immunoblotting. Interestingly, we detected several changes in the protein expression and degree of phosphorylation of SRC-pathway proteins that can be relevant for the therapeutic effects of these substances.""","""['Anders Øverbye', 'Maria Lyngaas Torgersen', 'Tonje Sønstevold', 'Tore Geir Iversen', 'Ýrr Mørch', 'Tore Skotland', 'Kirsten Sandvig']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Nanotoxicology""","""['Cellular uptake and intracellular degradation of poly(alkyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles.', 'Cabazitaxel-loaded Poly(2-ethylbutyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles improve treatment efficacy in a patient derived breast cancer xenograft.', 'Biodistribution of Poly(alkyl cyanoacrylate) Nanoparticles in Mice and Effect on Tumor Infiltration of Macrophages into a Patient-Derived Breast Cancer Xenograft.', 'From poly(alkyl cyanoacrylate) to squalene as core material for the design of nanomedicines.', 'Synthesis of poly(alkyl cyanoacrylate)-based colloidal nanomedicines.', 'An inter-laboratory comparison of an NLRP3 inflammasome activation assay and dendritic cell maturation assay using a nanostructured lipid carrier and a polymeric nanomedicine, as exemplars.', 'Interlaboratory evaluation of a digital holographic microscopy-based assay for label-free in vitro cytotoxicity testing of polymeric nanocarriers.', 'Standardization of an in vitro assay matrix to assess cytotoxicity of organic nanocarriers: a pilot interlaboratory comparison.', 'Label-Free Digital Holographic Microscopy for In Vitro Cytotoxic Effect Quantification of Organic Nanoparticles.']"""

Materials and methods:   Eighty-five patients with subsequently histologically proven PCa underwent bpMRI at 3 T (T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging) with 66 patients undergoing additional T1 mapping at 3 T. The PCa lesions as well as the peripheral and transition zones were segmented pixel by pixel in multiple slices of the 3D MRI data sets (T2-weighted images, apparent diffusion coefficient, and T1 maps). To increase the size of the data set, images were augmented for contrast, brightness, noise, and perspective multiple times, effectively increasing the sample size 10-fold, and 322 different radiomics features were extracted before and after augmentation. Four different machine learning algorithms, including a random forest (RF), stochastic gradient boosting (SGB), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbor, were trained with and without features from T1 maps to differentiate among 3 different Gleason groups (6, 7, and ≥8).  Results:   Support vector machine showed the highest accuracy of 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62-1.00) for classifying the different Gleason scores, followed by RF (0.83; 95% CI, 0.52-0.98), SGB (0.75; 95% CI, 0.43-0.95), and k-nearest neighbor (0.50; 95% CI, 0.21-0.79). Image augmentation resulted in an average increase in accuracy between 0.08 (SGB) and 0.48 (SVM). Removing T1 mapping features led to a decline in accuracy for RF (-0.16) and SGB (-0.25) and a higher generalization error.

Methods:   Newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer patients with M1a/b substages, treated with radical prostatectomy or external beam radiation therapy were abstracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database (2004-2016). Temporal trend analyses, propensity score matching, cumulative incidence plots, multivariate competing risks regression models and landmark analyses were used.  Results:   Of 4280 patients, 954 (22.3%) were treated with radical prostatectomy. After propensity score matching, 5-year cancer-specific mortality was 47.0 versus 53.0% in radical prostatectomy versus external beam radiation therapy patients (P = 0.003). In propensity score matched competing risks regression models, radical prostatectomy was associated with lower cancer-specific mortality versus external beam radiation therapy (hazard ratio 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.79-0.90; P = 0.001). Finally, landmark analyses rejected the bias favoring radical prostatectomy. Finally, in subgroup analyses, we relied on selection criteria that most closely resembled the STAMPEDE criteria and a similar hazard ratio of 0.8 (P < 0.001) was recorded.  Conclusion:   In metastatic prostate cancer, radical prostatectomy results in lower cancer-specific mortality relative to external beam radiation therapy. Even after adjustment for age at diagnosis, prostate-specific antigen and biopsy Gleason grade grouping, lower cancer-specific mortality rates are recorded in radical prostatectomy patients than in external beam radiation therapy patients. As a result, radical prostatectomy should be considered as a treatment option in selected metastatic prostate cancer patients.

Materials and methods:   We analyzed 11 consecutive patients treated with scanning CIRT for localized prostate cancer in our hospital between December 2015 and January 2016. In-room CT images were taken under treatment conditions in every treatment session. The dose distribution on each in-room CT image was recalculated, while retaining the pencil beam arrangement of the initial treatment plan. Then, the dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters including the percentage of the clinical target volume (CTV) with 95% and 90% of the prescribed dose area (V95% of CTV, V90% of CTV) and V80% of rectum were calculated. The acceptance criteria for the CTV and rectum were set at V95% of CTV ≥95%, V90% of CTV ≥98%, and V80% of rectum < 10 ml.  Results:   V95% of CTV, V90% of CTV, and V80% of rectum for the reproduced plans were 98.8 ± 3.49%, 99.5 ± 2.15%, and 4.39 ± 3.96 ml, respectively.

The scintillation material is embedded in a 700 µm diameter cavity within a 1 mm plastic optical fibre that is fixed within a brachytherapy needle. The high spatial resolution dosimeter is used to measure the dose contribution from Iodine-125 (I-125) seeds. Initially, the effects of sterilisation on the sensors (1) repeatability, (2) response as a function of angle, and (3) response as a function of distance, are evaluated in a custom polymethyl methacrylate phantom. Results obtained in this study demonstrate that the output response of the sensor, pre- and post-sterilisation are within the acceptable measurement uncertainty ranging from a maximum standard deviation of 4.7% pre and 5.5% post respectively, indicating that the low temperature sterilisation process does not damage the sensor or reduce performance. Subsequently, an LDR brachytherapy plan reconstructed using the VariSeed treatment planning system, in an anthropomorphic 3D printed training phantom, was used to assess the suitability of the sensor for applications in LDR brachytherapy. This phantom was printed based on patient anatomy, with the volume and dimensions of the prostate designed to represent that of the patient. I-125 brachytherapy seeds, with an average activity of 0.410 mCi, were implanted into the prostate phantom under trans-rectal ultrasound guidance; following the same techniques as employed in clinical practice by an experienced radiation oncologist.

Recent studies have also implicated NUMB as a PCa suppressor and an inhibitor of PCa stem cells (PCSCs); however, exactly how NUMB functions in these contexts remains unclear. Here, by employing bioinformatics analysis and luciferase assays and by conducting rescue experiments, we first show that NUMB is directly targeted by microRNA-9-5p (miR-9-5p), an oncogenic miR associated with poor prognosis in many malignancies. We further show that miR-9-5p levels are inversely correlated with NUMB expression in CD44+ PCSCs. miR-9-5p reduced NUMB expression and inhibited numerous PCSC properties including proliferation, migration, invasion as well as self-renewal. Strikingly, overexpression of NUMB in CD44+ PCSCs overcame all of the above PCSC properties enforced by miR-9-5p. Taken together, our results suggest that inhibiting the expression of the oncomiR miR-9-5p and overexpressing NUMB may represent novel therapeutic strategies to target PCSCs and PCa metastasis.""","""['Xuan Wang', 'Jun Cai', 'Lei Zhao', 'Dejun Zhang', 'Guojie Xu', 'Jianli Hu', 'Tao Zhang', 'Min Jin']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['miR-221-5p regulates proliferation and migration in human prostate cancer cells and reduces tumor growth in vivo.', 'miR-199a-3p targets stemness-related and mitogenic signaling pathways to suppress the expansion and tumorigenic capabilities of prostate cancer stem cells.', 'MiR-199a-5p represses the stemness of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma stem cells by targeting Sirt1 and CD44ICD cleavage signaling.', 'New insights into prostate cancer stem cells.', 'The role of NUMB/NUMB isoforms in cancer stem cells.', 'Evaluation of CD44 Expression in Prostatic Adenocarcinoma: An Institutional Study.', 'Hypoxia-inducible factor 1A inhibition overcomes castration resistance of prostate tumors.', 'State-of-the-art therapeutic strategies for targeting cancer stem cells in prostate cancer.', 'The Multitasker Protein: A Look at the Multiple Capabilities of NUMB.', 'Integrated Transcriptome Analysis Reveals the Crucial mRNAs and miRNAs Related to Fecundity in the Hypothalamus of Yunshang Black Goats during the Luteal Phase.']"""

The circulation dynamics of CTCs are important for understanding the mechanisms underlying tumor cell dissemination. Although studies have revealed that the circadian rhythm may disrupt the growth of tumors, it is generally unclear whether the circadian rhythm controls the release of CTCs. In clinical examinations, the current in vitro methods for detecting CTCs in blood samples are based on a fundamental assumption that CTC counts in the peripheral blood do not change significantly over time, which is being challenged by recent studies. Since it is not practical to draw blood from patients repeatedly, a feasible strategy to investigate the circadian rhythm of CTCs is to monitor them by in vivo detection methods. Fluorescence in vivo flow cytometry (IVFC) is a powerful optical technique that is able to detect fluorescent circulating cells directly in living animals in a noninvasive manner over a long period of time. In this study, we applied fluorescence IVFC to monitor CTCs noninvasively in an orthotopic mouse model of human prostate cancer. We observed that CTCs exhibited stochastic bursts over cancer progression. The probability of the bursting activity was higher at early stages than at late stages. We longitudinally monitored CTCs over a 24-h period, and our results revealed striking daily oscillations in CTC counts that peaked at the onset of the night (active phase for rodents), suggesting that the release of CTCs might be regulated by the circadian rhythm.""","""['Xi Zhu#', 'Yuanzhen Suo#', 'Yuting Fu', 'Fuli Zhang', 'Nan Ding', 'Kai Pang', 'Chengying Xie', 'Xiaofu Weng', 'Meilu Tian', 'Hao He', 'Xunbin Wei']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Light Sci Appl""","""['Proportion of circulating tumor cell clusters increases during cancer metastasis.', 'A Noninvasive and Real-Time Method for Circulating Tumor Cell Detection by In Vivo Flow Cytometry.', 'Advances of In Vivo Flow Cytometry on Cancer Studies.', 'In Vivo Lymphatic Circulating Tumor Cells and Progression of Metastatic Disease.', 'Early Dissemination of Circulating Tumor Cells: Biological and Clinical Insights.', 'Assessing Tumorigenicity in Stem Cell-Derived Therapeutic Products: A Critical Step in Safeguarding Regenerative Medicine.', 'A pilot study of the relative number of circulating tumor cells and leukocytes containing actin-binding proteins in head and neck cancer patients.', 'Signatures of Breast Cancer Progression in the Blood: What Could Be Learned from Circulating Tumor Cell Transcriptomes.', 'Near-infrared diffuse in vivo flow cytometry.', 'Circadian rhythm in prostate cancer: time to take notice of the clock.']"""

BRCA1/2 germline and somatic pathogenic mutations associated with similar benefit from olaparib; greater benefit was observed with homozygous BRCA2 deletion. Biallelic, but not monoallelic, PALB2 deleterious alterations were associated with clinical benefit. In the ATM cohort, loss of ATM protein by IHC was associated with a better outcome. RAD51 foci loss identified tumors with biallelic BRCA and PALB2 alterations while most ATM- and CDK12-altered APCs had higher RAD51 foci levels. Overall, APCs with homozygous BRCA2 deletion are exceptional responders; PALB2 biallelic loss and loss of ATM IHC expression associated with clinical benefit.

The CTCs that are able to survive the stresses encountered in the bloodstream can then seed metastases. We demonstrated previously that CTCs isolated from the blood of prostate cancer patients display specific nanomechanical phenotypes characteristic of cell endurance and invasiveness and patient sensitivity to androgen deprivation therapy. Here we report that patient-isolated CTCs are nanomechanically distinct from cells randomly shed from the tumor, with high adhesion as the most distinguishing biophysical marker. CTCs uniquely coisolated with macrophage-like cells bearing the markers of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). The presence of these immune cells was indicative of a survival-promoting phenotype of ""mechanical fitness"" in CTCs based on high softness and high adhesion as determined by atomic force microscopy. Correlations between enumeration of macrophages and mechanical fitness of CTCs were strong in patients before the start of hormonal therapy. Single-cell proteomic analysis and nanomechanical phenotyping of tumor cell-macrophage cocultures revealed that macrophages promoted epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity in prostate cancer cells, manifesting in their mechanical fitness. The resulting softness and adhesiveness of the mechanically fit CTCs confer resistance to shear stress and enable protective cell clustering. These findings suggest that selected tumor cells are coached by TAMs and accompanied by them to acquire intermediate epithelial/mesenchymal status, thereby facilitating survival during the critical early stage leading to metastasis. SIGNIFICANCE: The interaction between macrophages and circulating tumor cells increases the capacity of tumor cells to initiate metastasis and may constitute a new set of blood-based targets for pharmacologic intervention.""","""['Pawel A Osmulski', 'Alessandra Cunsolo', 'Meizhen Chen', 'Yusheng Qian', 'Chun-Lin Lin', 'Chia-Nung Hung', 'Devalingam Mahalingam', 'Nameer B Kirma', 'Chun-Liang Chen', 'Josephine A Taverna', 'Michael A Liss', 'Ian M Thompson', 'Tim H-M Huang', 'Maria E Gaczynska']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition leads to disease-stage differences in circulating tumor cell detection and metastasis in pre-clinical models of prostate cancer.', 'Nanomechanical biomarkers of single circulating tumor cells for detection of castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Single-cell analysis of circulating tumor cells identifies cumulative expression patterns of EMT-related genes in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Circulating Tumor Cells and Implications of the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition.', 'Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transition and Circulating Tumor Cells in Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'A nomogram was developed using clinicopathological features to predict postoperative liver metastasis in patients with colorectal cancer.', 'Immune cell membrane-based biomimetic nanomedicine for treating cancer metastasis.', 'Mechanobiology and survival strategies of circulating tumor cells: a process towards the invasive and metastatic phenotype.', 'Molecules promoting circulating clusters of cancer cells suggest novel therapeutic targets for treatment of metastatic cancers.', 'Transient interactions drive the lateral clustering of cadherin-23 on membrane.']"""

Diallyl trisulfide (DATS) is an organosulfur compound present in garlic. DATS has been shown to target PCa cells by induction of apoptosis, increase in the production of reactive oxygen species, degradation of ferritin protein and increase in the labile iron (Fe) pool.  Aim:   We hypothesize that DATS could induce ferroptosis, an Fe-dependent, unique non-apoptotic form of regulated cell death to eliminate therapy resistance encountered by PCa patients.  Methods: In vitro and in vivo studies should be performed to test the hypothesis.  Results:   As per the hypothesis, DATS would eliminate apoptotic resistance via inducing ferroptosis.  Conclusion:   Since apoptosis resistance has been reported to be the underlying mechanism of therapy resistance in PCa, DATS could be used to effectively target PCa cells by overcoming apoptosis resistance and inducing ferroptosis-mediated cell death of PCa cells.""","""['Angela Lincy Prem Antony Samy', 'Dhruvi Shah', 'Preksha Shahagadkar', 'Hillary Shah', 'Gnanasekar Munirathinam']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Nutr Health""","""['Garlic constituent diallyl trisulfide suppresses x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein in prostate cancer cells in culture and in vivo.', 'Diallyl trisulfide protects against ethanol-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis via a hydrogen sulfide-mediated mechanism.', 'Antioxidant effects of diallyl trisulfide on high glucose-induced apoptosis are mediated by the PI3K/Akt-dependent activation of Nrf2 in cardiomyocytes.', 'Molecular mechanisms and targets of cancer chemoprevention by garlic-derived bioactive compound diallyl trisulfide.', 'Molecular mechanisms of garlic-derived allyl sulfides in the inhibition of skin cancer progression.', 'EHHADH is a key gene in fatty acid metabolism pathways in hepatocellular carcinoma: a transcriptomic analysis.', 'Ferroptosis landscape in prostate cancer from molecular and metabolic perspective.', 'The role of ferroptosis in prostate cancer: a novel therapeutic strategy.', 'mRNA-Modified FUS/NRF2 Signalling Inhibits Ferroptosis and Promotes Prostate Cancer Growth.']"""

In this study, we examined the role of miR-572 in prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   The proliferation rates of LNCaP and PC-3 PCa cells were studied using MTT assays. Transwell migration and Matrigel invasion assays were performed to evaluate cell migration and invasion, respectively. Protein expression levels were examined using western blotting. Docetaxel-induced apoptosis was evaluated by Caspase-Glo3/7 assays. The putative miR-572 binding site in the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) was assessed with dual-luciferase reporter assays. Additionally, miR-572 expression levels in human PCa tissues were examined by qRT-PCR assays.  Results:   Upregulation of miR-572 promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion of PCa cells. Overexpression of miR-572 decreased sensitivity of PCa cells to docetaxel treatment by reducing docetaxel-induced apoptosis. MiR-572 can regulate migration and invasion in PCa cells. Furthermore, miR-572 could regulate expression of PTEN and p-AKT in PCa cells by directly binding to the PTEN 3' UTR. MiR-572 expression levels were increased in human PCa tissues and associated with PCa stage.
