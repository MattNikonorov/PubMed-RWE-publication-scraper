Andrographolide-derived SRJ09 and SRJ23 were reported to exhibit potent, selective inhibitory activities against colon and prostate cancer cells, respectively. In this study, previously developed resistant colon (HCT-116rst09) and prostate (PC-3rst23) cancer cell lines were used to elucidate the molecular mechanisms contributing to chemoresistance. Cytotoxic effects of SRJ09 and SRJ23 on both parental and resistant cells were investigated. Cell cycle distributions in HCT-116rst09 cells following SRJ09 treatment were analysed using flow cytometry. Whole-genome microarray analysis was performed on both parental and resistant cells to obtain differential gene expression profiles. Microarray data were subjected to protein-protein interaction network, functional enrichment, and pathway analyses. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to validate the changes in expression levels of selected genes. Besides morphological changes, HCT-116rst09 cells showed 7.0-fold resistance to SRJ09 while PC-3rst23 cells displayed a 5.5-fold resistance to SRJ23, as compared with their respective parental cells. G0/G1-phase cell cycle arrest was observed in HCT-116rst09 cells upon SRJ09 treatment. Collectively, 77 and 21 genes were found differentially modulated in HCT-116rst09 and PC-3rst23 cells, respectively. Subsequent bioinformatics analysis revealed several genes associated with FGFR4 and PI3K pathways, and cancer stemness, were chemoresistance mediators in HCT-116rst09 cells. RT-PCR confirmed the HMOX1 upregulation and ATG12 downregulation protected the PC-3rst23 cells from SRJ23 cytotoxicity. In conclusion, acquired chemoresistance to SRJ09 and SRJ23 in colon and prostate cancer cells, respectively, could be attributed to the alterations in the expression of genes such as those related to PI3K and autophagy pathways.""","""['Shun Ying Quah', 'Charng Choon Wong', 'Hui Chyn Wong', 'Kok Lian Ho', 'Nizar Abdul Manan', 'Pran Kishore Deb', 'Sreenivasa Rao Sagineedu', 'Johnson Stanslas']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Toxicol Appl Pharmacol""","""['Benzylidene derivatives of andrographolide inhibit growth of breast and colon cancer cells in vitro by inducing G(1) arrest and apoptosis.', 'SRJ09, a promising anticancer drug lead: Elucidation of mechanisms of antiproliferative and apoptogenic effects and assessment of in vivo antitumor efficacy.', 'SRJ23, a new semisynthetic andrographolide derivative: in vitro growth inhibition and mechanisms of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'In vitro 3D colon tumor penetrability of SRJ09, a new anti-cancer andrographolide analog.', 'Molecular characterization of established human colon carcinoma cell lines (HCT-8) made resistant to 5-fluorouracil by different selection schedules.']"""

Methods:   We identified a cohort of patients with low and favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer on AS at two large academic centers from February 2013 - December 2017. Analysis was restricted to patients with GG1 cancer on initial biopsy and a negative baseline or surveillance mpMRI, defined by the absence of PI-RADS 2 or greater lesions. We assessed ability of PSA, prostate volume and PSAD to predict upgrading on confirmatory biopsy.  Results:   We identified 98 patients on AS with negative baseline or surveillance mpMRI. Median PSA at diagnosis was 5.8 ng/mL and median PSAD was 0.08 ng/mL/mL. Fourteen men (14.3%) experienced Gleason upgrade at confirmatory biopsy. Patients who were upgraded had higher PSA (7.9 vs 5.4 ng/mL, P = .04), PSAD (0.20 vs 0.07 ng/mL/mL, P < .001), and lower prostate volumes (42.5 vs 65.8 mL, P = .01). On multivariate analysis, PSAD was associated with pathologic upgrade (OR 2.23 per 0.1-increase, P = .007). A PSAD cutoff at 0.08 generated a NPV of 98% for detection of pathologic upgrade.  Conclusion:   PSAD reliably discriminated the risk of Gleason upgrade at confirmatory biopsy among men with low-grade prostate cancer with negative MRI. PSAD could be clinically implemented to reduce the intensity of surveillance for a subset of patients.""","""['Benjamin H Press', 'Ghazal Khajir', 'Kamyar Ghabili', 'Cynthia Leung', 'Richard E Fan', 'Nancy N Wang', 'Michael S Leapman', 'Geoffrey A Sonn', 'Preston C Sprenkle']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Urology""","""['The ability of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density to predict an upgrade in Gleason score between initial prostate biopsy and prostatectomy diminishes with increasing tumour grade due to reduced PSA secretion per unit tumour volume.', 'MRI-Based Prostate-Specific Antigen Density Predicts Gleason Score Upgrade in an Active Surveillance Cohort.', 'The Use of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Follow-up of Patients Included in Active Surveillance Protocol.

CAC is an established predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD), with emerging data also supporting independent predictive value for cancer. The association of CAC with risk for individual cancer subtypes is unknown.  Methods and results:   We included 6271 MESA participants, aged 45-84 and without known CVD or self-reported history of cancer. There were 777 incident cancer cases during mean follow-up of 12.9 ± 3.1 years. Lung and colorectal cancer (186 cases) were grouped based on their strong overlap with CVD risk profile; prostate (men) and ovarian, uterine, and breast cancer (women) were considered as sex-specific cancers (in total 250 cases). Incidence rates and Fine and Gray competing risks models were used to assess relative risk of cancer-specific outcomes stratified by CAC groups or Log(CAC+1). The mean age was 61.7 ± 10.2 years, 52.7% were women, and 36.5% were White. Overall, all-cause cancer incidence increased with CAC scores, with rates per 1000 person-years of 13.1 [95% confidence interval (CI): 11.7-14.7] for CAC = 0 and 35.8 (95% CI: 30.2-42.4) for CAC ≥400. Compared with CAC = 0, hazards for those with CAC ≥400 were increased for lung and colorectal cancer in men [subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR): 2.2 (95% CI: 1.1-4.7)] and women [SHR: 2.2 (95% CI: 1.0-4.6)], but not significantly for sex-specific cancers across sexes.  Conclusion:   CAC scores were associated with cancer risk in both sexes; however, this was stronger for lung and colorectal when compared with sex-specific cancers. Our data support potential synergistic use of CAC scores in the identification of both CVD and lung and colorectal cancer risk.""","""['Omar Dzaye', 'Philipp Berning', 'Zeina A Dardari', 'Martin Bødtker Mortensen', 'Catherine Handy Marshall', 'Khurram Nasir', 'Matthew J Budoff', 'Roger S Blumenthal', 'Seamus P Whelton', 'Michael J Blaha']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Heart J Cardiovasc Imaging""","""['Coronary artery calcium is associated with long-term mortality from lung cancer: Results from the Coronary Artery Calcium Consortium.', 'Ten-year association of coronary artery calcium with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events: the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis (MESA).', 'Association Between Self-rated Health, Coronary Artery Calcium Scores, and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA).', 'Association of polygenic risk scores with incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events among individuals with coronary artery calcium score of zero: The multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis.', 'Evolution of Coronary Calcium Screening for Assessment of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk and Role in Preventive Cardiology.', 'Fully automated calcium scoring predicts all-cause mortality at 12 years in the MILD lung cancer screening trial.', 'Association between coronary artery disease and incident cancer risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies.', 'Simultaneous assessment of heart and lungs with gated high-pitch ultra-low dose chest CT using artificial intelligence-based calcium scoring.', 'E prostanoid receptor-3 promotes oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced human aortic smooth muscle cells inflammation.', 'Serum Anti-BRAT1 is a Common Molecular Biomarker for Gastrointestinal Cancers and Atherosclerosis.']"""

However, these trials might have missed a benefit in men with adverse pathology at RP given that these men were under-represented and immortal time bias might have been present; herein, we investigate this possibility.  Methods:   We evaluated the impact of adjuvant versus early sRT on all-cause mortality (ACM) risk in men with adverse pathology defined as positive pelvic lymph nodes (pN1) or pGleason score 8-10 prostate cancer (PC) and disease extending beyond the prostate (pT3/4). We used a treatment propensity score to minimize potential treatment selection bias when estimating the causal effect of adjuvant versus early sRT on ACM risk and a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact that varying definitions of adverse pathology had on ACM risk adjusting for age at RP, PC prognostic factors, site, and the time-dependent use of post-RP androgen deprivation therapy.  Results:   After a median follow-up (interquartile range) of 8.16 (6.00-12.10) years, of the 26,118 men in the study cohort, 2,104 (8.06%) died, of which 539 (25.62%) were from PC. After excluding men with a persistent prostate-specific antigen, adjuvant compared with early sRT was associated with a significantly lower ACM risk among men with adverse pathology at RP when men with pN1 PC were excluded (0.33 [0.13-0.85]; P = .02) or included (0.66 [0.44-0.99]; P = .04).  Conclusion:   Adjuvant radiation therapy should be considered in men with pN1 or pGleason score 8 to 10 and pT3/4 PC given the possibility that a significant reduction in ACM risk exists.""","""['Derya Tilki', 'Ming-Hui Chen', 'Jing Wu', 'Hartwig Huland', 'Markus Graefen', 'Thomas Wiegel', 'Dirk Böhmer', 'Osama Mohamad', 'Janet E Cowan', 'Felix Y Feng', 'Peter R Carroll', 'Bruce J Trock', 'Alan W Partin', ""Anthony V D'Amico""]""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Influence of adjuvant vs early salvage radiotherapy on lethality in men with high risk for recurrence following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Hochrisiko-Prostatakarzinom: Adjuvante versus frühe Salvage-Radiatio.', 'Long-term Impact of Adjuvant Versus Early Salvage Radiation Therapy in pT3N0 Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with Radical Prostatectomy: Results from a Multi-institutional Series.', 'Adjuvant Versus Early Salvage Radiation Therapy After Radical Prostatectomy for pN1 Prostate Cancer and the Risk of Death.', 'More Extensive Lymph Node Dissection at Radical Prostatectomy is Associated with Improved Outcomes with Salvage Radiotherapy for Rising Prostate-specific Antigen After Surgery: A Long-term, Multi-institutional Analysis.', 'Adjuvant vs. salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy.', 'Adjuvant and Salvage Radiotherapy after Radical Prostatectomy in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Hypofractionated Post-Prostatectomy Radiotherapy in 16 Fractions: A Single-Institution Outcome.', 'Radiation therapy after radical surgery in prostate cancer.', 'How To Manage T3b Prostate Cancer in the Contemporary Era: Is Radiotherapy the Standard of Care?', 'How To Manage T3b Prostate Cancer in the Contemporary Era: Referee Position.', 'ESTRO\xa0ACROP guideline on prostate bed delineation for postoperative radiotherapy in prostate cancer.']"""

Little is known about the phenotype in double heterozygotes who carry PVs in both genes.  Methods:   Carriers of double-PVs in any DNA MMR gene and BRCA1/2 attending one of three tertiary oncogenetic clinics between 1/2005 and 1/2020 were identified by database search, and their relevant data were retrieved and analyzed.  Results:   Eleven double carriers from four seemingly unrelated Ashkenazi Jewish families were evaluated. All carried an Ashkenazi Jewish founder BRCA PV, BRCA2 c.5946delT/c.6174delT (n = 10) or BRCA1 c.185delAG (n = 1). Four carried the MSH2 c.1906G > C founder PV, and 3, the MSH6 c.3984_3987dupGTCA founder PV; 3 patients had the MSH6 c.3956_3957dup PV. Eight double carriers (73%) had cancer: breast cancer (5 cases, 2 bilateral), melanoma (2 cases), urothelial cancer (2 cases), and colon, endometrial, prostate, cutaneous squamous cell cancer, glioblastoma, gastric stromal tumor, and lymphoma (1 case each). Six carriers had 1-2 tumors, one had 3 tumors, and one had 5 primary tumors. Age at diagnosis of the first tumor was 36-76 years. All carriers met NCCN BRCA1/2 testing criteria, and 3 met the revised Bethesda guidelines.

However, acquisition of contemporary tissue samples for molecular testing can be a barrier to deploying precision medicine approaches. We hypothesized that most DDR alterations represent truncal events in prostate cancer and that primary tissue would faithfully reflect mutations found in cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and/or metastatic tissue.  Objective:   To assess concordance in DDR gene alterations between primary prostate cancer and metastases or ctDNA specimens.  Design, setting, and participants:   Patients were included if a DDR pathway mutation was detected in metastatic tissue or ctDNA and primary tissue sequencing was available for comparison. Sequencing data from 3 cohorts were analyzed: (1) FoundationOne, (2) University of Washington clinical cases (University of Washington-OncoPlex or Stand Up to Cancer-Prostate Cancer Foundation International Dream Team sequencing pipelines), and (3) University of Washington rapid autopsy series. Only pathogenic somatic mutations were included, and more than 30 days between primary tumor tissue and ctDNA and/or metastatic tissue acquisition was required. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) and germline events were adjudicated by an expert molecular pathologist and excluded.  Main outcomes and measures:   The DDR gene alterations detected in primary prostate tissue matched with metastatic tissue and/or ctDNA findings.  Results:   A total of 72 men with known DDR alterations were included in the analysis, and primary samples with paired ctDNA and/or metastatic tissue were sequenced. After excluding patients with ctDNA where only CHIP and/or germline events (n = 21) were observed, 51 patients remained and were included in the final analysis. The median (range) time from acquisition of primary tissue to acquisition of ctDNA or tumor tissue was 55 (5-193) months. Concordance in DDR gene mutation status across samples was 84% (95% CI, 71%-92%). Rates of concordance between metastatic-primary and ctDNA-primary pairs were similar when patients with CHIP events were excluded.

Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly being relied upon for the diagnosis and characterization of PCa, but differentiating malignancy from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in the transition zone using MRI can be challenging. The characteristically high levels of zinc in human prostate tissue and a close relationship between malignant proliferation and zinc homeostatic dysregulation create opportunities to visualize PCa with novel contrast media. In mouse models, glucose-stimulated zinc secretion (GSZS) can be preferentially observed in healthy prostate tissue compared with malignant tissue; in vivo, these differences can be captured with MRI by using Gdl1, a gadolinium-based zinc-responsive contrast agent. In this study, we examined whether this technology can be applied in a large animal model by imaging older dogs with clinically diagnosed BPH.  Materials and methods:   Four intact male dogs 6 years or older with enlarged prostates were imaged (T1-weighted turbo spin-echo, TE/TR, 12/400 milliseconds and T2-weighted, TE/TR, 112/5000 milliseconds) using a 3 T scanner before and at multiple time points after intravenous injection of 0.05 mmol/kg GdL1 plus either (a) 2 mL/kg of 50% dextrose in 1 session or (b) 2 mL/kg normal saline in another session. The two sessions were one week apart, and their order was randomly determined for each dog. During postprocessing, regions of interest were generated in prostate tissue and in paraspinal muscles to evaluate the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). The ratio of CNR at any postinjection time point compared with baseline CNR was defined as r-CNR. After the second imaging session, the dogs were euthanized, and their prostates were harvested for histopathological examination. Baseline and postintervention plasma and urine samples were analyzed for total zinc by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.  Results:   The mean ± SD r-CNR values at 13 minutes postinjection in the dextrose versus saline imaging sessions were 134% ± 10% and 127% ± 7%, respectively (P < 0.01). The histopathologic evaluation of prostate tissues confirmed BPH in all dogs. Interestingly, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia was detected in 1 animal, and a suspicious mass was found in the same region on T2-weighted scans. The r-CNR of the mass was calculated as 113% ± 4% and 111% ± 6% in the dextrose and saline groups, respectively, with no significant differences between the 2 interventions (P = 0.54), whereas there was a statistically significant difference between the r-CNR of the whole prostate in the dextrose (130% ±11%) and saline (125% ± 9%) interventions (P = 0.03). Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analyses showed a significantly higher urinary zinc in the dextrose versus saline groups, but no differences were found in plasma zinc levels.  Conclusions:   T1-weighted MRI of the enlarged canine prostate showed higher r-CNR after injection of GdL1 plus dextrose compared with GdL1 plus saline, consistent with GSZS from BPH tissues. One small region of neoplastic tissue was identified in a single dog on the basis of less GSZS from that region by MRI. These findings suggest a new method for the detection of PCa by MRI that could facilitate the differentiation of BPH from PCa in the transition zone.""","""['Pooyan Khalighinejad', 'Daniel Parrott', 'Veronica Clavijo Jordan', 'Sara Chirayil', 'Christian Preihs', 'Neil M Rofsky', 'Yin Xi', 'A Dean Sherry']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Invest Radiol""","""['Revisiting quantitative multi-parametric MRI of benign prostatic hyperplasia and its differentiation from transition zone cancer.', 'Amide Proton Transfer Could Provide More Accurate Lesion Characterization in the Transition Zone of the Prostate.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'The controversial relationship between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer: the role of inflammation.', 'Zinc in Prostate Health and Disease: A Mini Review.', 'MRI Methods for Imaging Beta-Cell Function in the Rodent Pancreas.', 'Comparative Pathobiology of Canine and Human Prostate Cancer: State of the Art and Future Directions.']"""

In prostate cancer (PCa), increased KLK activity promotes tumor growth and metastasis through multiple biochemical pathways, and specific quantification and tracking of changes in the KLK activome could contribute to validation of KLKs as potential drug targets. Herein we report a technology platform based on novel activity-based probes (ABPs) and inhibitors enabling simultaneous orthogonal analysis of KLK2, KLK3, and KLK14 activity in hormone-responsive PCa cell lines and tumor homogenates. Importantly, we identifed a significant decoupling of KLK activity and abundance and suggest that KLK proteolysis should be considered as an additional parameter, along with the PSA blood test, for accurate PCa diagnosis and monitoring. Using selective inhibitors and multiplexed fluorescent activity-based protein profiling (ABPP), we dissect the KLK activome in PCa cells and show that increased KLK14 activity leads to a migratory phenotype. Furthermore, using biotinylated ABPs, we show that active KLK molecules are secreted into the bone microenvironment by PCa cells following stimulation by osteoblasts suggesting KLK-mediated signaling mechanisms could contribute to PCa metastasis to bone. Together our findings show that ABPP is a powerful approach to dissect dysregulation of the KLK activome as a promising and previously underappreciated therapeutic target in advanced PCa.""","""['Scott Lovell', 'Leran Zhang', 'Thomas Kryza', 'Anna Neodo', 'Nathalie Bock', 'Elena De Vita', 'Elizabeth D Williams', 'Elisabeth Engelsberger', 'Congyi Xu', 'Alexander T Bakker', 'Maria Maneiro', 'Reiko J Tanaka', 'Charlotte L Bevan', 'Judith A Clements', 'Edward W Tate']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Am Chem Soc""","""['Drugging the undruggable: activity-based protein profiling offers opportunities for targeting the KLK activome.', 'Kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) as emerging therapeutic targets: focus on prostate cancer and skin pathologies.', 'The molecular function of kallikrein-related peptidase 14 demonstrates a key modulatory role in advanced prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNA-3162-5p-Mediated Crosstalk between Kallikrein Family Members Including Prostate-Specific Antigen in Prostate Cancer.', 'Kallikrein-related peptidases targeted therapies in prostate cancer: perspectives and challenges.', 'The roles of proteases in prostate cancer.', 'A KLK6 Activity-Based Probe Reveals a Role for KLK6 Activity in Pancreatic Cancer Cell Invasion.', 'Novel inhibitors and activity-based probes targeting serine proteases.', 'Co-Crystal Structure-Guided Optimization of Dual-Functional Small Molecules for Improving the Peroxygenase Activity of Cytochrome P450BM3.', 'Novel specific activity-based probes validate KLK proteases as druggable targets.']"""

In the KG1a cell line, NUC-1031 and NUC-3373 have preferential cytotoxic effects on leukemic stem cells (LSCs). These effects were not diastereomer-specific and were not observed with the parental nucleoside analogues gemcitabine and FUDR, respectively. In addition, NUC-1031 preferentially targeted LSCs in primary AML samples and cancer stem cells in the prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP. Although the mechanism for this remains incompletely resolved, NUC-1031-treated cells showed increased levels of triphosphate in both LSC and bulk tumor fractions.

The present study uses histo-anatomical imaging to study prostate volume in correlation to prostate capsule thickness, and glandular epithelial cell density within the peripheral zone (PZ).  Materials and methods:   Specimens were selected from radical prostatectomies ranging from 20 to 160 mL based on ease of anatomical reconstruction by the slides. A total of 60 patients were selected and underwent quantitative measurements of prostate capsule thickness and glandular epithelial density within the PZ using computer-based imaging software. Pearson's correlation and a stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between these measured parameters and the clinical characteristic of these patients.  Results:   Pearson's correlation analysis revealed a strongly significant, negative correlation between prostate volume and glandular epithelial cell density (r(58)=-0.554, p<0.001), and a strongly significant, positive correlation between prostate volume and average capsule thickness (r(58)=0.462, p<0.001). Results of multiple regression analysis showed that average glandular epithelial cell density added statistically to this prediction (p<0.05).  Conclusions:   The results suggest that growth of the transition zone in BPH causes increased fibrosis of the PZ, leading to atrophy and fibrosis of glandular cells. As 80% of PCa originates from the glandular epithelium within the PZ, this observed phenomenon may explain the inverse correlation between BPH and PCa that is well-documented in the literature.""","""['Katherine G Holder', 'Bernardo Galvan', 'Andrew S Knight', 'Freedom Ha', 'Reagan Collins', 'Preston E Weaver', 'Luis Brandi', 'Werner T de Riese']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Investig Clin Urol""","""['Quantitative measurements of prostate capsule and gland density and their correlation to prostate size: possible clinical implications in prostate cancer.', 'Association between prostate size and glandular tissue volume of the peripheral zone via novel combined MRI and histopathology: possible pathophysiological implications on prostate cancer development.', 'Possible clinical implications of peripheral zone changes depending on prostate size.', 'Correlation of prostate peripheral zone thickness with benign prostatic hyperplasia/ lower urinary tract symptoms: An update.', 'Modified simple prostatectomy: an approach to address large volume BPH and associated prostate cancers.', 'Quisqualis indica extract for men with lower urinary tract symptoms: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.']"""

We aimed to construct and characterize the cancer cohort within N3C and identify risk factors for all-cause mortality from COVID-19.  Methods:   We used 4,382,085 patients from 50 US medical centers to construct a cohort of patients with cancer. We restricted analyses to adults ≥ 18 years old with a COVID-19-positive or COVID-19-negative diagnosis between January 1, 2020, and March 25, 2021. We followed N3C selection of an index encounter per patient for analyses. All analyses were performed in the N3C Data Enclave Palantir platform.  Results:   A total of 398,579 adult patients with cancer were identified from the N3C cohort; 63,413 (15.9%) were COVID-19-positive. Most common represented cancers were skin (13.8%), breast (13.7%), prostate (10.6%), hematologic (10.5%), and GI cancers (10%). COVID-19 positivity was significantly associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.24). Among COVID-19-positive patients, age ≥ 65 years, male gender, Southern or Western US residence, an adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index score ≥ 4, hematologic malignancy, multitumor sites, and recent cytotoxic therapy were associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality. Patients who received recent immunotherapies or targeted therapies did not have higher risk of overall mortality.  Conclusion:   Using N3C, we assembled the largest nationally representative cohort of patients with cancer and COVID-19 to date.

We hypothesize that weighted diffusion subtraction (WDS) images, created by weighted subtraction of high and low b-value DWIs, might better show areas of ADC values below a set threshold, thus decreasing the subjectivity of the assessment.  Purpose:   To evaluate the diagnostic ability of WDS for csPCa by comparing scores based on WDS images (DWI/WDS) with those based on PI-RADS DWI (DWI/ADC).  Study type:   Retrospective.  Subjects:   Eighty-six PCa patients.  Field strength/sequences:   3.0 T; DWI.  Assessment:   Four readers assessed the probability of csPCa in lesions (overall, in the peripheral zone [PZ] and transitional zone [TZ]) using 5-point DWI/ADC and DWI/WDS scores. Prostatectomy specimens were the reference standard. ADC values and contrast between csPCa and normal prostate tissue on ADC maps and WDS images were calculated with reference to the pathological map.  Statistical tests:   Diagnostic ability was evaluated by Jackknife alternative free-response receiver-operating characteristic curve. Figure of merit (FOM), sensitivity, and positive predictive value (PPV) between the DWI/ADC and DWI/WDS scores were compared using paired t-test. Inter-reader agreement was analyzed using κ statistics, and the significance probability was calculated using the Z statistic. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare contrast between csPCa and normal prostate tissue on ADC maps and WDS images. A P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Results:   FOM and sensitivity of the DWI/WDS scores were significantly better than those of the DWI/ADC scores overall, in the PZ and TZ (FOM: overall, 0.715 vs. 0.783; PZ, 0.756 vs. 0.815; TZ, 0.653 vs. 0.738. Sensitivity: overall, 0.512 vs. 0.607; PZ, 0.485 vs. 0.573; TZ, 0.636 vs. 0.761). For PPV, a statistically significant difference was observed overall (0.727 vs. 0.777). The κ value of DWI/WDS score was significantly higher than that of DWI/ADC score overall and in the PZ (overall, 0.614 vs. 0.792; PZ, 0.609 vs. 0.797). Contrast was significantly higher overall in the PZ and TZ in WDS images (median, 1.26, 1.19, and 1.61) than in ADC maps (0.46, 0.47, and 0.41).

In urothelial carcinoma (UC), CA9 has been identified as a urinary marker for disease detection, but its biologic role is unknown. To date, differential gene expression patterns of CA9 in various molecular subtypes and potential effects of CA9 inhibition in UC cells are unknown. We aimed to investigate the function of CA9 and the effects of CA9 inhibition in invasive UC.  Methods:   Immunohistochemistry was used to assess CA9 expression in a cohort of 153 patients undergoing radical cystectomy. CA9 expression was correlated with molecular subtype by analysis of the TCGA data and of our own cohort of 223 patients with invasive UC receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. CA9 expression was assessed in a panel of 12 UC cell lines by Western Blot and qPCR, and multiple siRNAs were used to silence CA9 in 2 cell lines. Effects of CA9 silencing on cell growth, migration, and invasion were assessed. We also used the small molecule inhibitor U-104 to inhibit CA9 in vitro and in an orthotopic xenograft model.  Results:   CA9 expression was higher in cancer tissue compared to benign urothelium and was particularly highly expressed in luminal papillary and basal squamous tumors. CA9 expression did not correlate with outcome after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or radical cystectomy. Silencing of CA9 by siRNA diminished invasion but did not induce a consistent change of cell growth and migration. Treatment with U-104 led to cell growth reduction only at high concentrations in vitro and failed to have a significant effect on tumor growth in vivo.  Conclusions:   The present study confirms over-expression of CA9 in UC and for the first time shows a correlation with molecular subtypes. However, CA9 expression showed no association with the outcome of patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer and inhibition of CA9 did not lead to a consistent inhibition of tumor growth. Based on these data, CA9 exhibits a role neither as a predictive or prognostic marker nor as a therapeutic target in invasive UC.""","""['Tilman Todenhöfer', 'Ewan A Gibb', 'Roland Seiler', 'Alireza Kamyabi', 'Jörg Hennenlotter', 'Paul McDonald', 'Igor Moskalev', 'Craig Stewart', 'Jian Gao', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Shoukat Dedhar', 'Arnulf Stenzl', 'Htoo Zarni Oo', 'Peter C Black']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Regulation of pH by Carbonic Anhydrase 9 Mediates Survival of Pancreatic Cancer Cells With Activated KRAS in Response to Hypoxia.', 'Cellular and radiobiological effects of carbonic anhydrase IX in human breast cancer cells.', 'Investigation of the Prognostic Role of Carbonic Anhydrase 9 (CAIX) of the Cellular mRNA/Protein Level or Soluble CAIX Protein in Patients with Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Carbonic anhydrase 9 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma: a marker for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.', 'Carbonic Anhydrase IX in Renal Cell Carcinoma, Implications for Disease Management.', 'PYY modulates the tumorigenesis and progression of colorectal cancer unveiled by proteomics.']"""

We previously reported that KX01 binds to the colchicine site of β-tubulin and its morpholine group lies close to α-tubulin's surface. Thus, we hypothesized that enhancing the interaction of KX01 with α-tubulin could increase tubulin inhibition and synthesized a series of KX01 derivatives directed by docking studies. Among these derivatives, 8a exhibited more than 10-fold antiproliferation activity in several tumor cells than KX01 and significantly improved in vivo antitumor effects.

Patient perception of the nomenclature used to describe low-grade prostate cancers may partly explain this discrepancy.  Methods:   A randomized online survey was administered to men without a history of prostate cancer, presenting a hypothetical clinical scenario in which they are given a new diagnosis of low-grade prostate cancer. The authors determined whether diagnosis nomenclature was associated with management preference and diagnosis-related anxiety using ratings given on a scale from 1 to 100, adjusting for participant characteristics through multivariable linear regression.  Results:   The survey was completed by 718 men. Compared with Gleason 6 out of 10 prostate cancer, the term grade group 1 out of 5 prostate cancer was associated with lower preference for immediate treatment versus active surveillance (β = -9.3; 95% CI, -14.4, -4.2; P < .001), lower diagnosis-related anxiety (β = -8.3; 95% CI, -12.8, -3.8; P < .001), and lower perceived disease severity (β = -12.3; 95% CI, -16.5, -8.1; P < .001) at the time of initial diagnosis. Differences decreased as participants received more disease-specific education. Indolent lesion of epithelial origin, a suggested alternative term for indolent tumors, was not associated with differences in anxiety or preference for active surveillance.  Conclusions:   Within a hypothetical clinical scenario, nomenclature for low-grade prostate cancer affects initial perception of the disease and may alter subsequent decision making, including preference for active surveillance. Disease-specific education reduces the differential impact of nomenclature use, reaffirming the importance of comprehensive counseling and clear communication between the clinician and patient.""","""['Matthew T Hudnall', 'Anuj S Desai', 'Kyle P Tsai', 'Adam B Weiner', 'Amanda X Vo', 'Oliver S Ko', 'Stephen Jan', 'Edward M Schaeffer', 'Shilajit D Kundu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['A disease by any other name: Effects of cancer grading nomenclature on perception of prostate cancer risk.', 'Prostate cancer nomenclature at diagnosis can affect treatment decisions.', 'Long-Term Cancer Specific Anxiety in Men Undergoing Active Surveillance of Prostate Cancer: Findings from a Large Prospective Cohort.', 'An evidence review of active surveillance in men with localized prostate cancer.', 'Selecting men diagnosed with prostate cancer for active surveillance using a risk calculator: a prospective impact study.', 'Older Age Predicts Biopsy and Radical Prostatectomy Grade Reclassification to Aggressive Prostate Cancer in Men on Active Surveillance.', 'Gleason 6 Prostate Cancer: Translating Biology into Population Health.']"""

Methods:   Ten patients who underwent HoLEP after prior PAE were matched according to age, weight of resected prostate tissue, and anticoagulation status in 1:2 ratio with patients who underwent HoLEP without prior PAE by a researcher who was blinded to patient's outcome at the time of matching. Histopathological examination of prostate tissue was performed to look for changes related to prior PAE. Patient's demographics, perioperative parameters, and follow-up data were retrospectively compared.  Results:   The median interval between PAE and HoLEP was 25 months [IQR 14.5-37.5]. Patients demographic were comparable in both groups. Intra-operatively plane of enucleation were well-maintained in spite of prior PAE. The differences in duration of surgery, enucleation efficiency, hemoglobin drop, duration of catheterization and hospital stay, and complications were statistically insignificant. Incidental prostate cancer was identified in 10% specimens from both groups. Post-PAE prostate specimens demonstrated evidence of remote-healed infarction represented by dense hyalinized paucicellur connective tissue with surrounding squamous metaplasia. There were no statistically significant differences in AUA symptom scores, maximum urine flow rate, post-void residual urine volume, and PSA at 3- and 6-month follow-up between both groups.

Main outcomes and measures:   Stratified linear and log-linear Poisson regressions were used to estimate time trends in the proportion of men treated with RP across American Urological Association tumor risk and PCCI (a validated predictor of LE based on age and comorbidities) subgroups.  Results:   Among 5736 men (mean [SD] age at surgery, 62 [6] years) treated with RP from 2000 to 2017, the proportion of low-risk tumors treated with RP decreased from 51% to 7% (difference, -44%; 95% CI, -50% to -38%).

Objective:   To examine whether molecular subtypes predict response to apalutamide, using archived primary tumor samples from the randomized, double-blind, phase 3 SPARTAN trial.  Design, setting, and participants:   In this cohort study, gene expression data from 233 archived samples from patients with nmCRPC enrolled in the SPARTAN trial were generated using a human exon microarray. The present analysis was conducted from May 10, 2018, to October 15, 2020.  Interventions:   Patients were randomized (2:1) to apalutamide, 240 mg/d, with androgen deprivation therapy (apalutamide+ADT) or placebo+ADT.  Main outcomes and measures:   Patients were stratified into high-risk and low-risk categories for developing metastases based on genomic classifier (GC) scores for high (GC >0.6) and low to average (GC≤0.6) and into basal and luminal subtypes; associations between these molecular subtypes and metastasis-free survival (MFS), overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival 2 (PFS2) were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis.  Results:   Median age of the 233 included patients was 73 (range, 49-91) years. A total of 116 of 233 patients (50%) in the SPARTAN biomarker subset had high GC scores. Although all patients receiving apalutamide+ADT had improved outcomes, having high GC scores was associated with the greatest improvement in MFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.21; 95% CI, 0.11-0.40; P < .001), OS (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.29-0.94; P = .03), and PFS2 (HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.23-0.67; P = .001) vs placebo+ADT. In total, 152 of 233 patients (65%) had the basal molecular subtype. Although there were no significant differences in MFS, PFS2, or OS between patients with the luminal vs basal subtype in the placebo+ADT arm, patients with the luminal subtype in the apalutamide+ADT arm had a significantly longer MFS (apalutamide+ADT: HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.18-0.91; P = .03; placebo+ADT: HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.33-1.31; P = .23) compared with patients with basal subtype; similar trends were observed for OS (apalutamide+ADT: HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.25-0.98; P = .04; placebo+ADT: HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.38-1.60; P = .50), and PFS2 (apalutamide+ADT: HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.42-1.22; P = .22; placebo+ADT: HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.38-1.39; P = .33). In regression analysis, the luminal-basal subtype score was significantly associated with MFS in patients receiving apalutamide+ADT (HR, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.15-6.08; P = .02), whereas GC score was significantly associated with MFS in placebo+ADT recipients (HR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.02-4.27; P = .04).  Conclusions and relevance:   The findings of this study suggest that the GC score and basal-luminal subtype derived from archived tumor specimens may be biomarkers of response to apalutamide+ADT in the nmCRPC setting. Although overall, the addition of apalutamide to ADT was beneficial, higher-risk and luminal subtypes appeared to benefit most.

Objective:   This study aimed to investigate effects of atorvastatin (AS) on PCa cells proliferation and clarify the associated mechanisms.  Methods:   PCa cell lines were cultured and treated with irradiation (IR) (4 Gy), AS (6 μg/ml), transfected with Bcl-2 siRNA, and then divided into different groups. Xenograft tumor mouse model was established. Bcl-2 and MSH2 gene transcription and protein expression were evaluated using RT-PCR assay and western blot assay. Plate clone formation assay was employed to examine colony formation. MTT assay was used to detect cell viabilities. Flow cytometry analysis was utilized to verify apoptosis. Co-immunoprecipitation and immuno-fluorescence assay were used to identify interaction between Bcl-2 and MSH2.  Results:   IR significantly reduced colony formation, enhanced Bcl-2 and reduced MSH2 gene transcription in PCa cells compared to un-treated cells (p<0.05). AS significantly strengthened radio-therapeutic effects of IR on colony formation, decreased cell apoptosis and increased Bcl-2 gene transcription/protein expression in PCa cells compared to single IR treatment cells (p<0.05). AS combining IR down-regulated MSH2 gene transcription/protein expression in PCa cells compared to single IR treatment cells (p<0.05).

Methods:   Associations of ALDOA expression with clinicopathological features and patient prognosis in PCa were evaluated based on data obtained from the Taylor database and our clinical tissue microarray. The potential roles of ALDOA in malignant progression were verified using a series of in vivo and in vitro experiments after stable ALDOA overexpression and knockdown in DU145 and PC3 cell lines. An aldolase A inhibitor was used to determine the effects of inhibition of ALDOA on PCa cell proliferation.  Results:   Higher expression of ALDOA was positively correlated with the incidence of postoperative metastasis and biochemical recurrence (BCR) and may predict poor prognosis in PCa patients. In vivo experiments demonstrated that overexpression of ALDOA could significantly promote cell proliferation, prolong the cell cycle, and significantly reduce the apoptosis rate of PCa cells. Knockdown of expression of ALDOA could inhibit the proliferation and shorten the cell cycle of PCa cells significantly, with no significant effects on cell apoptosis (P > 0.05). In vitro experiments showed that overexpression of ALDOA could significantly promote tumor growth (P < 0.05), while treatment with the Aldolase A inhibitor naphthol AS-E phosphate dose-dependently suppressed the growth of PCa cells (P < 0.01). The analysis of datasets from the Taylor database showed that there was negative regulatory relationship between the expression of ALDOA and MYPT1 (P < 0.001).  Conclusion:   Our study revealed that ALDOA played an important role in the progression of PCa. The MYPT1-ALDOA signaling axis may be a new target for the clinical treatment of PCa patients given its negative regulatory relationship. Our study suggests that Aldolase A inhibitors may represent a novel approach to inhibit the growth of PCa.""","""['Qiwen Kuang#', 'Yuxiang Liang#', 'Yangjia Zhuo#', 'Zhiduan Cai', 'Funeng Jiang', 'Jianjiang Xie', 'Yu Zheng', 'Weide Zhong']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Onco Targets Ther""","""['High expression of fructose-bisphosphate aldolase\xa0A induces progression of renal cell carcinoma.', 'Feedback regulation of ALDOA activates the HIF-1α/MMP9 axis to promote lung cancer progression.', 'Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase A is a key regulator of hypoxic adaptation in colorectal cancer cells and involved in treatment resistance and poor prognosis.', 'Fructose-Bisphosphate Aldolase A Regulates Hypoxic Adaptation in Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Involved with Tumor Malignancy.', 'Aldolase A promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition to increase malignant potentials of cervical adenocarcinoma.', 'An Update on the Metabolic Landscape of Oncogenic Viruses.', 'Druggable Metabolic Vulnerabilities Are Exposed and Masked during Progression to Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Circular RNA KIF4A Promotes Liver Metastasis of Breast Cancer by Reprogramming Glucose Metabolism.', 'Comparative Transcriptome Analysis of Organ-Specific Adaptive Responses to Hypoxia Provides Insights to Human Diseases.', 'Transcriptome Analyses Identify a Metabolic Gene Signature Indicative of Antitumor Immunosuppression of EGFR Wild Type Lung Cancers With Low PD-L1 Expression.']"""

Although the reactivation of embryonic signals in adult cells is one of the characteristics of cancer, the underlying protein degradation mechanism remains elusive. Here, we show that the molecular chaperone GRP75 is a key player in PC cells by maintaining the protein stability of SIX1, a transcription factor for embryonic development. Mechanistically, GRP75 provides a platform to recruit the deubiquitinating enzyme USP1 to inhibit K48-linked polyubiquitination of SIX1. Structurally, the C-terminus of GRP75 (433-679 aa) contains a peptide binding domain, which is required for the formation of GRP75-USP1-SIX1 protein complex. Functionally, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of the GRP75-USP1-SIX1 protein complex suppresses tumor growth and overcomes the castration resistance of PC cells in vitro and in xenograft mouse models. Clinically, the protein expression of SIX1 in PC tumor tissues is positively correlated with the expression of GRP75 and USP1.

Their high abundance in all bodily fluids and their stable source of origin dependent biomarkers make EVs a powerful tool in biomarker discovery and diagnostics.

However, no study has examined the prognostic value of NLR and PLR in the context of CTCs.  Methods:   Baseline CTCs from mCRPC patients were enumerated using the CellSearch System. Baseline NLR and PLR values were calculated using the data from routine complete blood counts. The associations of CTC, NLR, and PLR values, individually and jointly, with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis, as well as univariate and multivariate Cox models.  Results:   CTCs were detected in 37 (58.7%) of 63 mCRPC patients, and among them, 16 (25.4%) had ≥5 CTCs. The presence of CTCs was significantly associated with a 4.02-fold increased risk for progression and a 3.72-fold increased risk of death during a median follow-up of 17.6 months. OS was shorter among patients with high levels of NLR or PLR than those with low levels (log-rank P = 0.023 and 0.077). Neither NLR nor PLR was individually associated with PFS. Among the 37 patients with detectable CTCs, those with a high NLR had significantly shorter OS (log-rank P = 0.024); however, among the 26 patients without CTCs, the OS difference between high- and low-NLR groups was not statistically significant. Compared to the patients with CTCs and low NLR, those with CTCs and high levels of NLR had a 3.79-fold risk of death (P = 0.036). This association remained significant after adjusting for covariates (P = 0.031). Combination analyses of CTC and PLR did not yield significant results.

The objective of this study was to assess the impact of the bladder neck angle (BNA) measured by postoperative MRI on midterm recovery of urinary continence (UC) in patients undergoing RARP. Patients and Methods: This study retrospectively included 200 consecutive patients with prostate cancer who were treated by RARP and received MRI 3 months after RARP. Based on postoperative MRI, the BNA was measured as the angle between the anterior and posterior bladder walls. The midterm recovery of UC was defined as the use of either no pad or an occasional security pad at 6 months after RARP. Results: One hundred forty-four of the 200 patients (72.0%) achieved midterm recovery of UC and the median BNA was 70°. There were no significant differences in several parameters, including age, body mass index, total prostate volume, preservation of the neurovascular bundle, and postoperative membranous urethral length (MUL), between patients with BNA ≥70° and <70°. Of these parameters, only the BNA and postoperative MUL were independently associated with the midterm recovery of UC. The optimal cutoff points of the BNA and MUL (65° and 9 mm, respectively) were calculated by the receiver operating characteristics curve, and a scoring model for the prediction of midterm recovery of UC was developed according to the logistic regression analysis. This scoring model was demonstrated to be satisfactorily calibrated (p for Hosmer-Lemeshow test = 0.49) and provide good discrimination (area under the curve: 0.723; p < 0.001). Conclusions: These findings suggest that midterm recovery of UC after RARP is favorably affected by the large BNA and long postoperative MUL, and our scoring model can be used as a reliable tool for predicting the midterm continence status after RARP.""","""['Toshiki Ito', 'Kyohei Watanabe', 'Yuto Matsushita', 'Hiromitsu Watanabe', 'Keita Tamura', 'Daisuke Motoyama', 'Takayuki Sugiyama', 'Atsushi Otsuka', 'Hideaki Miyake']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Pelvic Anatomical Features After Retzius-Sparing Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy Intended for Early Recovery of Urinary Symptoms.', 'A Combination of Findings Obtained from Pre- and Postoperative Imaging Predict Recovery of Urinary Continence After Non-nerve-sparing Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy.', 'A Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial Examining the Impact of the Retzius-sparing Approach on Early Urinary Continence Recovery After Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Value of Different Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based Measurements of Anatomical Structures on Preoperative Prostate Imaging in Predicting Urinary Continence After Radical Prostatectomy in Men with Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.']"""

Methods:   The relative expression of TRIM66 in prostate tumor was interrogated by microarray. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting were performed to determine the transcript abundances and protein expressions of TRIM66, HP1γ, AR, c-Myc, and GAPDH. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were analyzed by cell counting kit-8 method and flow cytometry. The regulatory action of c-Myc on TRIM66 was interrogated with luciferase reporter plasmid and the direct binding was demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. The secretory prostate-specific antigen was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.  Results:   TRIM66 was aberrantly overexpressed in prostate cancer and associated with unfavorable prognosis. TRIM66/HP1γ/AR was upregulated during the androgen-independent transition in hormone-deprived medium. The TRIM66 level positively linked to cell proliferation and negatively linked to cell apoptosis in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. QL treatment specifically inhibited c-Myc and therefore directly downregulated TRIM66 via binding to its promoter.

Results:   In the training cohort, AR-gained patients treated with adapted docetaxel regimen had a significantly worse median progression-free survival (PFS) (3.8 vs 6.3 months, hazard ratio [HR] 2.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34-4.95, p < 0.0001), median overall survival (10.8 vs 20.6 months, HR 1.98, 95% CI 1.09-3.62, p = 0.0064) and PSA response (PSA > -50%: odds ratio 4.88 95%CI 1.55-14.32, p = 0.013) as compared to plasma AR normal patients. These findings were all confirmed in the validation cohort. However, in patients treated with standard docetaxel regimen, these differences were not seen. The interaction between AR CN status and dose reduction of docetaxel was considered as independent factor for PFS in both the training and validation cohort (HR 2.84, 95% CI 1.41-5.73, p = 0.003, and HR 4.79, 95% CI 1.79-12.82, p = 0.002).  Conclusion:   Despite the retrospective non-randomised design of this study, our hypothesis-generating findings could suggest plasma AR as a potential biomarker for optimal docetaxel timing and dose in mCRPC patients.

Given potential toxicity, patient selection is critical. We present our institutional experience with sHDRBT and validate a recursive partitioning machines model for biochemical control.  Materials and methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis of 129 patients who underwent whole-gland sHDRBT between 1998 and 2016. We evaluated clinical factors associated with biochemical control as well as toxicity.  Results:   At diagnosis the median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 7.77 ng/mL. A majority of patients had T1-2 (73%) and Gleason 6-7 (82%) disease; 71% received external beam radiation therapy (RT) alone, and 22% received permanent prostate implants. The median disease-free interval (DFI) was 56 months, and median presalvage PSA was 4.95 ng/mL. At sHDRBT, 46% had T3 disease and 51% had Gleason 8 to 10 disease. At a median of 68 months after sHDRBT, 3- and 5-year disease-free survival were 85% (95% CI, 79-91) and 71% (95% CI, 62-79), respectively. Median PSA nadir was 0.18 ng/mL, achieved a median of 10 months after sHDRBT. Patients with ≥35%+ cores and a DFI <4.1 years had worse biochemical control (19% vs 50%, P = .02). Local failure (with or without regional/distant failure) was seen in 11% of patients (14/129), and 14 patients (11%) developed acute urinary obstruction requiring Foley placement and 19 patients (15%) developed strictures requiring dilation.  Conclusions:   sHDRBT is a reasonable option for patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer after definitive RT. Those with <35%+ cores or an initial DFI of ≥4.1 years may be more likely to achieve long-term disease control after sHDRBT.""","""['Susan Y Wu', 'Anthony C Wong', 'Katsuto Shinohara', 'Mack Roach rd', 'J Adam M Cunha', 'Gilmer Valdes', 'I-Chow Hsu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Salvage brachytherapy for recurrent prostate cancer after definitive radiation therapy: A comparison of low-dose-rate and high-dose-rate brachytherapy and the importance of prostate-specific antigen doubling time.', 'Salvage HDR brachytherapy for recurrent prostate cancer after previous definitive radiation therapy: 5-year outcomes.', 'Salvage of locally recurrent prostate cancer after external beam radiation using reduced-dose brachytherapy with neoadjuvant plus adjuvant androgen deprivation.', 'Patient selection, cancer control, and complications after salvage local therapy for postradiation prostate-specific antigen failure: a systematic review of the literature.', 'A systematic overview of radiation therapy effects in prostate cancer.']"""

Little data are available for renal cell carcinoma (RCC).  Materials and methods:   We designed a multicenter prospective observational study to assess the correlation between CTC counts and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic RCC treated with an antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor as a first-line regimen; overall survival (OS) and response were secondary objectives. CTC counts were enumerated by the CellSearch system at four time points: day 0 of treatment, day 28, day 56 and then at progression, or at 12 months in the absence of progression.  Results:   One hundred ninety-five eligible patients with a median age of 69 years were treated with sunitinib (77.5%) or pazopanib (21%). At baseline, 46.7% of patients had one or more CTCs per milliliter (range, 1 to 263). Thirty patients had at least three CTCs, with a median PFS of 5.8 versus 15 months in the remaining patients (p = .002; hazard ratio [HR], 1.99), independently of the International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium score at multivariate analysis (HR, 1.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-3.14). Patients with at least three CTCs had a shorter estimated OS of 13.8 months versus 52.8 months in those with fewer than three CTCs (p = .003; HR, 1.99; multivariate analysis HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 0.95-2.93). Baseline CTC counts did not correlate with response; neither did having CTC sequencing counts greater than or equal to one, two, three, four, or five.  Conclusion:   We provide prospective evidence that the presence of three or more CTCs at baseline is associated with a significantly shorter PFS and OS in patients with metastatic RCC.  Implications for practice:   This prospective study evaluated whether the presence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the peripheral blood correlates with activity of first-line tyrosine kinase inhibitors in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). This study demonstrated that almost half of patients with metastatic RCC have at least one CTC in their blood and that those patients with at least three CTCs are at increased risk of early progressive disease and early death due to RCC.

Resistance to docetaxel further reduces the survival of these patients. Herein, we performed a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between docetaxel sensitive and resistant PCa (DRPC) cell based on Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were applied for functional and pathway analysis of DEGs. The STRING database, cytoscape software and plug-in 'cytoHubba' were used to construct protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and identify hub genes. Survival analysis were performed via GEPIA database. Finally, we conducted immune infiltration analysis by TIMER. A total of 460 DEGs were identified. GO functional analysis showed that these DEGs are mainly enriched in chemotaxis, negative regulation of intracellular signal transduction, and regulation of cell adhesion, positive regulation of inflammatory response, regulation of response to cytokine stimulus. According to the results of KEGG pathway analysis, these DEGs are mainly involved in signaling by Rho GTPases, Miro GTPases and RHOBTB3; interferon Signaling; arginine biosynthesis; PI3K-Akt signaling pathway; cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction; MAPK signaling pathway. Finally, CCNB1 and EZH2 were identified as prognostic hub genes and the expression of these two genes were associated with immune infiltration.

In this paper, we present the first such completely markerless AR guidance system for robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP) that transforms medical data from transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) to endoscope camera image. Moreover, we reduce the total number of transformations by combining the hand-eye and camera calibrations in a single step.  Methods:   Our proposed solution requires two transformations: TRUS to robot, [Formula: see text], and camera projection matrix, [Formula: see text] (i.e., the transformation from endoscope to camera image frame). [Formula: see text] is estimated by the method proposed in Mohareri et al. (in J Urol 193(1):302-312, 2015). [Formula: see text] is estimated by selecting corresponding 3D-2D data points in the endoscope and the image coordinate frame, respectively, by using a CAD model of the surgical instrument and a preoperative camera intrinsic matrix with an assumption of a projective camera. The parameters are estimated using Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Overall mean re-projection errors (MRE) are reported using simulated and real data using a water bath. We show that [Formula: see text] can be re-estimated if the focus is changed during surgery.  Results:   Using simulated data, we received an overall MRE in the range of 11.69-13.32 pixels for monoscopic and stereo left and right cameras. For the water bath experiment, the overall MRE is in the range of 26.04-30.59 pixels for monoscopic and stereo cameras. The overall system error from TRUS to camera world frame is 4.05 mm. Details of the procedure are given in supplementary material.  Conclusion:   We demonstrate a markerless AR guidance system for RALRP that does not need calibration markers and thus has the capability to re-estimate the camera projection matrix if it changes during surgery, e.g., due to a focus change.""","""['Megha Kalia', 'Apeksha Avinash', 'Nassir Navab', 'Septimiu Salcudean']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg""","""['Evaluation of a marker-less, intra-operative, augmented reality guidance system for robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'A partial augmented reality system with live ultrasound and registered preoperative MRI for guiding robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Real-Time FEM-Based Registration of 3-D to 2.5-D Transrectal Ultrasound Images.', 'Anastomotic leak after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: evaluation with MDCT cystography with multiplanar reformatting and 3D display.', 'The Use of Three-dimensional Visualization Techniques for Prostate Procedures: A Systematic Review.', 'Towards transcervical ultrasound image guidance for transoral robotic surgery.']"""

Organ absorbed doses after intravenous injection of 223Ra were estimated and compared to clinical data and data of an earlier modelling study.  Methods:   The most recent systemic biokinetic model of 223Ra and its progeny, developed by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), as well as the ICRP human alimentary tract model were applied for the radiopharmacokinetic modelling of Xofigo® biodistribution in patients after bolus administration. Independent kinetics were assumed for the progeny of 223Ra. The time activity curves for 223Ra were modelled and the time integrated activity coefficients, [Formula: see text] in the source regions for each progeny were determined. For estimating the organ absorbed doses, the Specific Absorbed Fractions (SAF) and dosimetric framework of ICRP were used together with the aforementioned [Formula: see text] values.  Results:   The distribution of 223Ra after injection showed a rapid plasma clearance and a low urinary excretion. Main elimination was via faeces. Bone retention was found to be about 30% at 4 h post-injection. Similar tendencies were observed in clinical trials of other authors. The highest absorbed dose coefficients were found for bone endosteum, liver and red marrow, followed by kidneys and colon.  Conclusion:   The biokinetic modelling of 223Ra and its progeny may help to predict their distributions in patients after administration of Xofigo®. The organ dose coefficients of this work showed some variation to the values reported from clinical studies and an earlier compartmental modelling study.

Methods:   This is a single-arm, prospective study of men with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level rising to 0.1-2.5 ng/mL following radical prostatectomy. Patients were staged with 68Ga-PSMA-PET and those with a negative finding, or a positive finding localised to the prostate bed, continued to SRT only to the prostate bed alone with real-time target-tracking using electromagnetic transponders. The primary endpoint was freedom from biochemical relapse (FFBR, PSA > 0.2 ng/mL from the post-radiotherapy nadir). Secondary endpoints were time to biochemical relapse, toxicity and patient-reported quality of life (QoL).  Results:   Ninety-two patients (median PSA of 0.18 ng/ml, IQR 0.12-0.36), were screened with 68Ga-PSMA-PET and metastatic disease was found in 20 (21.7%) patients. Sixty-nine of 72 non-metastatic patients elected to proceed with SRT. At the interim (3-year) analysis, 32 (46.4%) patients (95% CI 34.3-58.8%) were FFBR.

Methods:   We conducted a secondary data analysis of a large study within the German National Cancer Plan which enrolled primary care cancer survivors diagnosed with colon, prostatic, or breast cancer. We selected candidate predictors based on a systematic MEDLINE search. Using supervised machine learning, we developed a prediction model for anxiety by splitting the data into a 70% training set and a 30% test set and further split the training set into 10-folds for cross-validating the hyperparameter tuning step during model selection. We fit six different regression models, selected the model that maximized the root mean square error (RMSE) and fit the selected model to the entire training set. Finally, we evaluated the model performance on the holdout test set.  Results:   In total, data from 496 cancer survivors were analyzed. The LASSO model (α = 1.0) with weakly penalized model complexity (λ = 0.015) slightly outperformed all other models (RMSE = 0.370). Physical symptoms, namely, fatigue/weakness (β = 0.18), insomnia (β = 0.12), and pain (β = 0.04), were the most important predictors, while the degree of physical comorbidity was negligible.  Conclusions:   Prediction of clinically significant anxiety in cancer survivors using readily available predictors is feasible. The findings highlight the need for considering cancer survivors' physical functioning regardless of the degree of comorbidity when assessing their psychological well-being.

We examined rates of cardiovascular events among cancer patients with bone metastases and mortality following such events.  Methods:   Using Danish health registries, we identified all Danish cancer patients diagnosed with bone metastases (1994-2013) and followed them from bone metastasis diagnosis. We computed incidence rates (IR) per 100 person-years and cumulative incidence for first-time inpatient hospitalization or outpatient clinic visit for cardiovascular events, defined as myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or venous thromboembolism (VTE). We also analyzed all-cause mortality rates including cardiovascular events as time-varying exposure with adjustment for age, sex, and Charlson Comorbidity Index score. All analyses were performed overall and stratified by cancer type (prostate, breast, lung, and other).  Results:   We included 23,113 cancer patients with bone metastases. The cumulative incidence of cardiovascular events was 1.3% at 30 days, 3.7% at 1 year, and 5.2% at 5 years of follow-up. The highest IR was observed for VTE, followed by ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction, both overall and by cancer types. Lung cancer patients with bone metastases had the highest incidence of cardiovascular events followed by prostate and breast cancer. Occurrence of any cardiovascular event was a strong predictor of death (5 years following the event, the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.8 [95% confidence interval: 1.7-1.9]).  Conclusion:   Cancer patients with bone metastases had a substantial risk of developing cardiovascular events, and these events were associated with a subsequent increased mortality.

To identify splicing factors important for prostate cancer (PCa) fitness, we performed pooled shRNA screens in vitro and in vivo. Our screens identified heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M (HNRNPM) as a regulator of PCa cell growth. RNA- and eCLIP-sequencing identified HNRNPM binding to transcripts of key homeostatic genes. HNRNPM binding to its targets prevents aberrant exon inclusion and backsplicing events. In both linear and circular mis-spliced transcripts, HNRNPM preferentially binds to GU-rich elements in long flanking proximal introns. Mimicry of HNRNPM-dependent linear-splicing events using splice-switching-antisense-oligonucleotides was sufficient to inhibit PCa cell growth. This suggests that PCa dependence on HNRNPM is likely a result of mis-splicing of key homeostatic coding and non-coding genes. Our results have further been confirmed in other solid tumors. Taken together, our data reveal a role for HNRNPM in supporting cancer cell fitness. Inhibition of HNRNPM activity is therefore a potential therapeutic strategy in suppressing growth of PCa and other solid tumors.""","""['Jessica Sy Ho', 'Federico Di Tullio', 'Megan Schwarz', 'Diana Low', 'Danny Incarnato', 'Florence Gay', 'Tommaso Tabaglio', 'JingXian Zhang', 'Heike Wollmann', 'Leilei Chen', 'Omer An', 'Tim Hon Man Chan', 'Alexander Hall Hickman', 'Simin Zheng', 'Vladimir Roudko', 'Sujun Chen', 'Alcida Karz', 'Musaddeque Ahmed', 'Housheng Hansen He', 'Benjamin D Greenbaum', 'Salvatore Oliviero', 'Michela Serresi', 'Gaetano Gargiulo', 'Karen M Mann', 'Eva Hernando', 'David Mulholland', 'Ivan Marazzi', 'Dave Keng Boon Wee', 'Ernesto Guccione']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Elife""","""['hnRNPM, a potential mediator of YY1 in promoting\xa0the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of prostate cancer cells.', 'Cell type-restricted activity of hnRNPM promotes breast cancer metastasis via regulating alternative splicing.', 'CircURI1 interacts with hnRNPM to inhibit metastasis by modulating alternative splicing in gastric cancer.', 'A 360° view of circular RNAs: From biogenesis to functions.', 'RNA splicing and splicing regulator changes in prostate cancer pathology.', 'Circular RNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma: biogenesis, function, and pathology.', 'Emerging roles of noncoding RNAs in human cancers.', 'The RNA-binding proteins hnRNP H and F regulate splicing of a MYC-dependent HRAS exon in prostate cancer cells.', 'MYC regulates a pan-cancer network of co-expressed oncogenic splicing factors.', 'A circular RNA Edis-Relish-castor axis regulates neuronal development in Drosophila.']"""

Since the first MRI was performed, enormous progress has been made in diagnosis, treatment, and follow up of PCa, mainly due to multiparametric prostatic MRI (mpMRI). Although mpMRI has become the best imaging tool for identifying PCa, some limitations still exist. Prostate imaging with mpMRI is, to date, the best way to locate suspicious lesions to trigger prostate biopsy, plan active surveillance, or definitive treatment. In case of relapse, mpMRI can help detect local disease and provide specific management. It is well known that there is a subset of patients in whom mpMRI fails to depict csPCa. These missed significant cancers demand great attention. Prostate mpMRI quality depends on several factors related to equipment (including equipment vendor, magnet field and gradient strength, coil set used, software and hardware levels, sequence parameter choices), patient (medications, body habitus, motion, metal implants, rectal gas), and most importantly the radiologic interpretation of images (learning curve effects, subjectivity of observations, interobserver variations, and reporting styles). Inter-reader variability represents a huge current limitation of this method. Therefore, mpMRI remains the best imaging tool available to detect PCa, guiding diagnosis, treatment, and follow up while inter-reader variability represents the best limitation.

The prebiopsy BP-MRI data (T2-Weighted Image [T2WI] and the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient [ADC]) of 459 patients with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer were acquired using two scanners from different vendors. The prostate biopsies are the reference standard for diagnosing benign and malignant prostate lesions. The training set was 168 patients' data from Siemens (Vendor 1), and the inner test set was 70 patients' data from the same vendor. The external test set was 221 patients' data from GE (Vendor 2). The lesion Region of Interest (ROI) was manually delineated by experienced radiologists. A total of 851 radiomics features including shape, first-order statistical, texture, and wavelet features were extracted from ROI in T2WI and ADC, respectively. Two feature-ranking methods (Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance [MRMR] and Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test [WRST]) and three classifiers (Random Forest [RF], Support Vector Machine [SVM], and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator [LASSO] regression) were investigated for their efficacy in building single-parametric radiomics signatures. A biparametric radiomics model was built by combining the optimal single-parametric radiomics signatures. A comprehensive diagnosis model was built by combining the biparametric radiomics model with age and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) value using multivariable logistic regression. All models were built in the training set and independently validated in the inner and external test sets, and the performances of models in the diagnosis of benign and malignant prostate lesions were quantified by the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC). The mean AUCs of the inner and external test sets were calculated for each model. The non-inferiority test was used to test if the AUC of model in external test was not inferior to the AUC of model in inner test. Combining MRMR and LASSO produced the best-performing single-parametric radiomics signatures with the highest mean AUC of 0.673 for T2WI (inner test AUC = 0.729 vs. external test AUC = 0.616, p = 0.569) and the highest mean AUC of 0.810 for ADC (inner test AUC = 0.822 vs. external test AUC = 0.797, p = 0.102).

We profile the dynamic transcriptome associated with this transition at multiple time points (0 h, 1 h, 24 h, 96 h), and confirm that expression patterns are strongly indicative of a progressive basal to luminal cell differentiation program based on human expression signatures. Furthermore, we establish dynamic patterns of DNA methylation associated with this program by use of whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). Expression patterns associated with androgen induced luminal cell differentiation were found to have significantly elevated DNA methylation dynamics. Shifts in methylation profiles were strongly associated with Polycomb repressed regions and to promoters associated with bivalency, and strongly enriched for binding motifs of AR and MYC. Importantly, we found that dynamic DNA methylation patterns observed in the normal luminal cell differentiation program were significant targets of aberrant methylation in prostate cancer.

Treatment of C4-2 cells with si4F2hc was found to suppress cellular growth, migratory and invasive abilities, with this effect occurring through the cell cycle, with a significant decrease in S phase and a significant increase in G0/G1 phase, suggesting cell cycle arrest. In addition, it was proven by RNA seq that the key to 4F2hc's impact on cancer is SKP2. si4F2hc upregulates the protein expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (P21cip1, P27kip1) through the downstream target SKP2. Furthermore, the expression of 4F2hc and LAT1 in prostate cancer cells suggests the importance of 4F2hc. Multivariate analysis showed that high 4F2hc expression was an independent prognostic factor for progression-free survival (HR 11.54, p = 0.0357). High 4F2hc was related to the clinical tumour stage (p = 0.0255) and Gleason score (p = 0.0035).

A patient-specific 3D anatomical model of those structures, namely the neurovascular bundles (NVB) and the external urethral sphincters (EUS), can enable physicians to perform such assessments intuitively. As a crucial step to generate a patient-specific anatomical model from preoperative MRI in a clinical routine, we propose a multi-class automatic segmentation based on an anisotropic convolutional network. Our specific challenge is to train the network model on a unique source dataset only available at a single clinical site and deploy it to another target site without sharing the original images or labels. As network models trained on data from a single source suffer from quality loss due to the domain shift, we propose a semi-supervised domain adaptation (DA) method to refine the model's performance in the target domain. Our DA method combines transfer learning and uncertainty guided self-learning based on deep ensembles. Experiments on the segmentation of the prostate, NVB, and EUS, show significant performance gain with the combination of those techniques compared to pure TL and the combination of TL with simple self-learning ([Formula: see text] for all structures using a Wilcoxon's signed-rank test). Results on a different task and data (Pancreas CT segmentation) demonstrate our method's generic application capabilities. Our method has the advantage that it does not require any further data from the source domain, unlike the majority of recent domain adaptation strategies.

Highest frequencies of individual somatic variants in the TLSs of NBPF20 and CHCHD2 reached 10.1% among LAML and 8.1% among skin cancer patients, respectively. Functional evaluation by dual luciferase reporter assays identified 19 uORF variants causing significant translational deregulation of the associated main coding sequence, ranging from 1.73-fold induction for an AUG.1 > UUG variant in SETD4 to 0.006-fold repression for a CUG.6 > GUG variant in HLA-DRB1.

Due to their superior cell-killing ability and the relative simplicity of their preparation, immunotoxin molecules have great potential in the clinical treatment of cancer, and several such molecules have been approved for clinical application. In this study, we adopted a relatively simple strategy based on a single-domain antibody (sdAb) and an improved Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) toxin (PE24X7) to prepare a safer immunotoxin against prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) for PCa treatment. The designed anti-PSMA immunotoxin, JVM-PE24X7, was conveniently prepared in its soluble form in an Escherichia coli (E. coli) system, avoiding the complex renaturation process needed for immunotoxin preparation by the conventional strategy. The product was very stable and showed a very strong ability to bind the PSMA receptor. Cytotoxicity assays showed that this molecule at a very low concentration could kill PSMA-positive PCa cells, with an EC50 value (concentration at which the cell viability decreased by 50%) of 15.3 pM against PSMA-positive LNCaP cells. Moreover, this molecule showed very good killing selectivity between PSMA-positive and PSMA-negative cells, with a selection ratio of more than 300-fold. Animal studies showed that this molecule at a very low dosage (5 × 0.5 mg/kg once every three days) completely inhibited the growth of PCa tumors, and the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) was more than 15 mg/kg, indicating its very potent tumor-treatment ability and a wide therapeutic window. Use of the new PE toxin, PE24X7, as the effector moiety significantly reduced off-target toxicity and improved the therapeutic window of the immunotoxin. The above results demonstrate that the designed anti-PSMA immunotoxin, JVM-PE24X7, has good application value for the treatment of PCa.""","""['Yutong Xing', 'Keyuan Xu', 'Shixiong Li', 'Li Cao', 'Yue Nan', 'Qiyu Li', 'Wenjing Li', 'Zhangyong Hong']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Preclinical evaluation of a novel anti-mesothelin immunotoxin based on a single domain antibody as the targeting ligand.', 'Anti-tumor effects and lack of side effects in mice of an immunotoxin directed against human and mouse prostate-specific membrane antigen.', 'Preclinical evaluation of a recombinant anti-prostate specific membrane antigen single-chain immunotoxin against prostate cancer.', 'Efficacy Against Human Prostate Cancer by Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-specific, Transforming Growth Factor-β Insensitive Genetically Targeted CD8+ T-cells Derived from Patients with Metastatic Castrate-resistant Disease.', 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Directed Therapy for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Nanobody-Based EGFR-Targeting Immunotoxins for Colorectal Cancer Treatment.', 'Enhanced cytotoxicity of a Pseudomonas Exotoxin A based immunotoxin against prostate cancer by addition of the endosomal escape enhancer SO1861.', 'Multimodal Radiobioconjugates of Magnetic Nanoparticles Labeled with 44Sc and 47Sc for Theranostic Application.', 'Gamma radiation coupled ADP-ribosyl transferase activity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PE24 moiety.', 'Engineered antibody fusion proteins for targeted disease therapy.']"""

We have shown that PC3-derived EVs (PC3-EVs) activate inflammasome cascade in non-cancerous PNT2 cells. It is known that the endogenous biomolecules and Natriuretic Peptides (NPs), such as ANP and BNP, inhibit inflammasome activation in immune cells. Here we investigated whether ANP and BNP modify PCa inflammatory phenotype in vitro. By using PNT2, LNCaP, and PC3 cell lines, which model different PCa progression stages, we analyzed inflammasome activation and the related pathways by Western blot and IL-1β secretion by ELISA. We found that tumor progression is characterized by constitutive inflammasome activation, increased IL-1β secretion, and reduced endogenous NPs expression. The administration of exogenous ANP and BNP, via p38-MAPK or ERK1/2-MAPK, by inducing NLRP3 phosphorylation, counteract inflammasome activation and IL-1β maturation in PC3 and PC3-EVs-treated PNT2 cells, respectively.

We hypothesized that radium-223 and bortezomib combination treatment would have additive effects on MM. In vitro experiments revealed that the combination treatment inhibited MM cell proliferation and demonstrated additive efficacy. In the systemic, syngeneic 5TGM1 mouse MM model, both bortezomib and radium-223 decreased the osteolytic lesion area, and their combination was more effective than either monotherapy alone. Bortezomib decreased the number of osteoclasts at the tumor-bone interface, and the combination therapy resulted in almost complete eradication of osteoclasts. Furthermore, the combination therapy improved the incorporation of radium-223 into MM-bearing bone. Importantly, the combination therapy decreased tumor burden and restored body weights in MM mice.

In this study, a CAD system that detects and identifies prostate cancer from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is developed. Methods: The proposed system first uses non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to integrate three different types of features for the accurate segmentation of prostate regions. Then, discriminatory features in the form of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) volumes are estimated from the segmented regions. The ADC maps that constitute these volumes are labeled by a radiologist to identify the ADC maps with malignant or benign tumors. Finally, transfer learning is used to fine-tune two different previously-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models (AlexNet and VGGNet) for detecting and identifying prostate cancer. Results: Multiple experiments were conducted to evaluate the accuracy of different CNN models using DWI datasets acquired at nine distinct b-values that included both high and low b-values. The average accuracy of AlexNet at the nine b-values was 89.2±1.5% with average sensitivity and specificity of 87.5±2.3% and 90.9±1.9%. These results improved with the use of the deeper CNN model (VGGNet). The average accuracy of VGGNet was 91.2±1.3% with sensitivity and specificity of 91.7±1.7% and 90.1±2.8%.

However, the actual mechanism of how TAM improves cancer cell survival still remains elusive and controversial.

In this study, the psychosocial distress associated with waiting for cancer surgery during the pandemic was investigated. This cross-sectional, convergent mixed-methods study included patients with lower priority disease during the first wave of COVID-19 at an academic, tertiary care hospital in eastern Canada. Participants underwent semi-structured interviews and completed two questionnaires: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Qualitative analysis was completed through a thematic analysis approach, with integration achieved through triangulation. Fourteen participants were recruited, with cancer sites including thyroid, kidney, breast, prostate, and a gynecological disorder. Increased anxiety symptoms were found in 36% of patients and depressive symptoms in 14%. Similarly, 64% of patients experienced moderate or high stress. Six key themes were identified, including uncertainty, life changes, coping strategies, communication, experience, and health services. Participants discussed substantial distress associated with lifestyle changes and uncertain treatment timelines. Participants identified quality communication with their healthcare team and individualized coping strategies as being partially protective against such symptoms.

The aim of our study was to assess the GG accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound (MRI-US) fusion prostate biopsy. Materials and Methods: Of a cohort of minimally invasive radical prostatectomy (RP), we selected all patients who were diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa) via MRI-US fusion biopsy (n = 115). Results: Combined biopsy had the highest rate for GG concordance (61.7% vs. 60.4% for SB vs. 45.3% for MRI-US fusion biopsy) and the lowest for upgrading (20.9% vs. 24.5% for SB vs. 34.9% for MRI-US fusion biopsy), p < 0.0001. No clinical data were predictive for upgrading or downgrading at final pathology. Locally advanced PCa was associated with a high Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PIRADS) score (p = 0.0014) and higher percentages of positive biopsy cores (PBC)/targeted (p = 0.0002) and PBC/total (p = 0.01). Positive surgical margins were correlated with higher percentages of PBC/systematic (p = 0.003) and PBC/total (p = 0.009).

Biomarker-based active phenolic flavonoids isolated from medicinal plants might shed some light on potential therapeutics for treating HCC. 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) is a unique biologically active dimer of indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a phytochemical compound derived from Brassica species of cruciferous vegetables-such as broccoli, kale, cabbage, and cauliflower. It has anti-cancer effects on various cancers such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, endometrial cancer, and colon cancer. However, the molecular mechanism of DIM involved in reducing cancer risk and/or enhancing therapy remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to evaluate anti-cancer and therapeutic effects of DIM in human hepatoma cell lines Hep3B and HuhCell proliferation was measured with MTT and trypan blue colony formation assays. Migration, invasion, and apoptosis were measured with Transwell assays and flow cytometry analyses. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) intensity and the loss in mitochondrial membrane potential of Hep3B and Huh7 cells were determined using dihydroethidium (DHE) staining and tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester dye. Results showed that DIM significantly suppressed HCC cell growth, proliferation, migration, and invasion in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, DIM treatment activated caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway and suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via ER stress and unfolded protein response (UPR). Taken together, our results suggest that DIM is a potential anticancer drug for HCC therapy by targeting ER-stress/UPR.""","""['Suvesh Munakarmi', 'Juna Shrestha', 'Hyun-Beak Shin', 'Geum-Hwa Lee', 'Yeon-Jun Jeong']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cells""","""['Anticancer effects of Poncirus\xa0fructus on hepatocellular carcinoma through regulation of apoptosis, migration, and invasion.', '16-O-caffeoyl-16-hydroxylhexadecanoic acid, a medicinal plant-derived phenylpropanoid, induces apoptosis in human hepatocarcinoma cells through ROS-dependent endoplasmic reticulum stress.', ""3'3-Diindolylmethane inhibits migration, invasion and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma by suppressing FAK signaling."", ""Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms of 3,3'-Diindolylmethane in Gastrointestinal Cancer."", ""Attenuation of multi-targeted proliferation-linked signaling by 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM): from bench to clinic."", 'A Comprehensive Review of Health-Benefiting Components in Rapeseed Oil.', 'Research Trend and Detailed Insights into the Molecular Mechanisms of Food Bioactive Compounds against Cancer: A Comprehensive Review with Special Emphasis on Probiotics.', ""Hepatoprotective Effects of a Natural Flavanol 3,3'-Diindolylmethane against CCl4-Induced Chronic Liver Injury in Mice and TGFβ1-Induced EMT in Mouse Hepatocytes via Activation of Nrf2 Cascade."", ""Curcumin, thymoquinone, and 3, 3'-diindolylmethane combinations attenuate lung and liver cancers progression."", ""3,3'-Diindolylmethane induces apoptosis and autophagy in fission yeast.""]"""

Methods:   A retrospective cohort of 224 patients with suspected prostate cancer was included from January 2016 to November 2018. All the patients underwent a multi-parametric MR scan before biopsy. Two radiologists independently evaluated the MR examinations using PI-RADS v2, PA PI-RADS v2, and a biparametric MRI protocol, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the three different protocols were drawn.  Results:   In total, 90 out of 224 cases (40.18%) were pathologically diagnosed as prostate cancer. The area under the ROC curves (AUC) for diagnosing prostate cancers by biparametric MRI, PI-RADS v2, and PA PI-RADS v2 were 0.938, 0.935, and 0.934, respectively. For cancers in the peripheral zone (PZ), the diagnostic sensitivity was 97.1% for PI-RADS v2/PA PI-RADS v2 and 96.2% for biparametric MRI. Moreover, the specificity was 84.0% for biparametric MRI and 58.0% for PI-RADS v2/PA PI-RADS v2. For cancers in the transition zone (TZ), the diagnostic sensitivity was 93.4% for PA PI-RADS v2 and 88.2% for biparametric MRI/PI-RADS v2. Furthermore, the specificity was 95.4% for biparametric MRI/PI-RADS v2 and 78.0% for PA PI-RADS v2.

The influence of proteins and particle PEGylation on miRNA adsorption were also explored. We found that low particle concentrations and physiological temperature both led to increased miRNA adsorption. Adsorption of miRNA was also higher when proteins were present in the same solution; reducing or preventing protein adsorption by PEGylating the MSNs hindered adsorption. Finally, the amount of miRNA adsorbed from human serum by MSN-NH2 was compared to a commercial miRNA purification kit (TaqMan®, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

The advantage of this novel method is threefold: (1) eliminating the need of an initial learning period, therefore reducing patient imaging dose, (2) more robust against measurement noise and (3) more computationally efficient. In this paper, the novel KF method was evaluatedin silicousing patients' 3D prostate motion and simulated 2D projections.Methods.A KF framework was implemented to estimate 3D motion from 2D projection measurements in real-time during prostate cancer treatments. The noise covariance matrix was adaptively estimated from the previous 10 measurements. This method did not require an initial learning period as the KF process distribution was initialised using a population covariance matrix. This method was evaluated using a ground-truth motion dataset of 17 prostate cancer patients (536 trajectories) measured with electromagnetic transponders. 3D motion was projected onto a rotating imager (SID = 180 cm) (pixel size = 0.388 mm) and rotation speed of 6°/s and 2°/s to simulate VMAT treatments. Gantry-varying additive random noise (≤5 mm) was added to ground-truth measurements to simulate segmentation error and image quality degradation due to the patient's pelvic bones. For comparison, motion was also estimated using the clinically implemented Gaussian probability density function (PDF) method initialised with 600 projections.Results.Without noise, the 3D root mean square-errors (3D RMSEs) of motion estimated by the KF method were 0.4 ± 0.1 mm and 0.3 ± 0.2 mm for 2°/s and 6°/s gantry rotation, respectively. With noise, 3D RMSEs of KF estimated motion were 1.1 ± 0.1 mm for both slow and fast gantry rotation scenarios. In comparison, using a Gaussian PDF method, with noise, 3D RMSE was 2 ± 0.1 mm for both gantry rotation scenarios.Conclusion.This work presents a fast and accurate method for real-time 2D to 3D motion estimation using a KF approach to handle the random-walk component of prostate cancer motion.

Two observers evaluated the images following the PI-RADS v2.1. guideline before biopsy and radical prostatectomy. The discrepancies were resolved in a joint meeting. A genitourinary pathologist reviewed the whole-digitalized mount specimens, and the lesions with Gleason score of 7 and above (3 + 4 and above), and/or cancers with a maximum diameter of 6 mm and more, and/or extraprostatic extension were accepted as clinically significant PCa.

Methods:   The authors used the Veterans Health Administration Corporate Data Warehouse to identify 40,412 African American and non-Hispanic White men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer from 2001 to 2013. Patients were followed through 2019. Multivariable logistic regression was used to measure associations between race and incident depression, which were ascertained from administrative and depression screening data. Cox proportional hazards models were used to measure associations between incident depression and all-cause mortality, with race-by-depression interactions used to assess disparities.  Results:   Overall, 10,013 veterans (24.5%) were diagnosed with depression after a diagnosis of prostate cancer. Incident depression was associated with higher all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-1.32). African American veterans were more likely than White veterans to be diagnosed with depression (29.3% vs 23.2%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.15; 95% CI, 1.09-1.21).

We aimed to provide evidence for risk-adapted starting age of screening for relatives of patients with PCa.  Methods and findings:   In this register-based nationwide cohort study, all men (aged 0 to 96 years at baseline) residing in Sweden who were born after 1931 along with their fathers were included. During the follow-up (1958 to 2015) of 6,343,727 men, 88,999 were diagnosed with stage III/IV PCa or died of PCa. The outcomes were defined as the diagnosis of stage III/IV PCa or death due to PCa, stratified by age at diagnosis. Using 10-year cumulative risk curves, we calculated risk-adapted starting ages of screening for men with different constellations of family history of PCa. The 10-year cumulative risk of stage III/IV or fatal PCa in men at age 50 in the general population (a common recommended starting age of screening) was 0.2%. Men with ≥2 FDRs diagnosed with PCa reached this screening level at age 41 (95% confidence interval (CI): 39 to 44), i.e., 9 years earlier, when the youngest one was diagnosed before age 60; at age 43 (41 to 47), i.e., 7 years earlier, when ≥2 FDRs were diagnosed after age 59, which was similar to that of men with 1 FDR diagnosed before age 60 (41 to 45); and at age 45 (44 to 46), when 1 FDR was diagnosed at age 60 to 69 and 47 (46 to 47), when 1 FDR was diagnosed after age 69. We also calculated risk-adapted starting ages for other benchmark screening ages, such as 45, 55, and 60 years, and compared our findings with those in the guidelines.

One study using a claims-based prognostic index showed that receipt of cancer screening itself was associated with lower mortality, suggesting that the index may misclassify individuals when used to inform cancer screening, but this finding was attributed to residual confounding because the index did not account for functional status.  Objective:   To examine whether cancer screening remains significantly associated with all-cause mortality in older adults after accounting for both comorbidities and functional status.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cohort study included individuals older than 65 years who were eligible for breast or prostate cancer screening and who participated in the 2004 Health and Retirement Study. Data were linked to Medicare claims from 2001 to 2015. Data analysis was conducted from January to November 2020.  Main outcomes and measures:   A Cox model was used to estimate the association between all-cause mortality over 10 years and receipt of screening mammogram or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, adjusting for variables in a prognostic index that included age, sex, comorbidities, and functional status. Potential confounders (ie, education, income, marital status, geographic region, cognition, self-reported health, self-care, and self-perceived mortality risk) of the association between cancer screening and mortality were also tested.  Results:   The breast cancer screening cohort included 3257 women (mean [SD] age, 77.8 [7.5] years); the prostate cancer screening cohort included 2085 men (mean [SD] age, 76.1 [6.8] years). Receipt of screening mammogram was associated with lower hazard of all-cause mortality after accounting for all index variables (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.60-0.74). A weaker, but still statistically significant, association was found for screening PSA (aHR 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78-0.99). None of the potential confounders attenuated the association between screening and mortality except for cognition, which attenuated the aHR for mammogram from 0.67 (95% CI, 0.60-0.74) to 0.73 (95% CI, 0.64-0.82) and the aHR for PSA from 0.88 (95% CI, 0.78-0.99) to 0.92 (95% CI, 0.80-1.05), making PSA screening no longer statistically significant.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this study, cognition attenuated the observed association between cancer screening and mortality among older adults. These findings suggest that existing mortality prediction algorithms may be missing important variables that are associated with receipt of cancer screening and long-term mortality. Relying solely on algorithms to determine cancer screening may misclassify individuals as having limited life expectancy and stop screening prematurely. Screening decisions need to be individualized and not solely dependent on life expectancy prediction.""","""['Nancy L Schoenborn', 'Orla C Sheehan', 'David L Roth', 'Tansu Cidav', 'Jin Huang', 'Shang-En Chung', 'Talan Zhang', 'Sei Lee', 'Qian-Li Xue', 'Cynthia M Boyd']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Breast and prostate cancer screening rates by cognitive status in US older adults.', 'Clinician Factors Associated With Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening in Older Veterans With Limited Life Expectancy.', 'Influence of Age, Health, and Function on Cancer Screening in Older Adults with Limited Life Expectancy.', 'Screening for prostate cancer.', 'Screening for Skin Cancer in Adults: An Updated Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Relationship Between Age, Comorbidity, and the Prevalence of Erectile Dysfunction.', ""Hospitalized Women's Perspective on Willingness-to-Screen for Cancers in Relation to Life Expectancy."", 'Personalising therapy for early-stage oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer in older women.', 'Factors Associated With Low-Value Cancer Screenings in the Veterans Health Administration.']"""

Accurate diagnosis can directly benefit a patient's quality of life and prognosis. Towards addressing this issue, we present a learning model for the automatic identification of prostate cancer. While many prostate cancer studies have adopted Raman spectroscopy approaches, none have utilised the combination of Raman Chemical Imaging (RCI) and other imaging modalities. This study uses multimodal images formed from stained Digital Histopathology (DP) and unstained RCI. The approach was developed and tested on a set of 178 clinical samples from 32 patients, containing a range of non-cancerous, Gleason grade 3 (G3) and grade 4 (G4) tissue microarray samples. For each histological sample, there is a pathologist labelled DP-RCI image pair. The hypothesis tested was whether multimodal image models can outperform single modality baseline models in terms of diagnostic accuracy. Binary non-cancer/cancer models and the more challenging G3/G4 differentiation were investigated. Regarding G3/G4 classification, the multimodal approach achieved a sensitivity of 73.8% and specificity of 88.1% while the baseline DP model showed a sensitivity and specificity of 54.1% and 84.7% respectively. The multimodal approach demonstrated a statistically significant 12.7% AUC advantage over the baseline with a value of 85.8% compared to 73.1%, also outperforming models based solely on RCI and mean and median Raman spectra. Feature fusion of DP and RCI does not improve the more trivial task of tumour identification but does deliver an observed advantage in G3/G4 discrimination. Building on these promising findings, future work could include the acquisition of larger datasets for enhanced model generalization.""","""['Trevor Doherty', 'Susan McKeever', 'Nebras Al-Attar', 'Tiarnán Murphy', 'Claudia Aura', 'Arman Rahman', ""Amanda O'Neill"", 'Stephen P Finn', 'Elaine Kay', 'William M Gallagher', 'R William G Watson', 'Aoife Gowen', 'Patrick Jackman']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Analyst""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Dimensional reduction based on peak fitting of Raman micro spectroscopy data improves detection of prostate cancer in tissue specimens.', 'Deep Learning-Based Gleason Grading of Prostate Cancer From Histopathology Images-Role of Multiscale Decision Aggregation and Data Augmentation.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Identification of intraductal carcinoma of the prostate on tissue specimens using Raman micro-spectroscopy: A diagnostic accuracy case-control study with multicohort validation.', 'Fusing hand-crafted and deep-learning features in a convolutional neural network model to identify prostate cancer in pathology images.', 'High-Resolution Histopathological Image Classification Model Based on Fused Heterogeneous Networks with Self-Supervised Feature Representation.', 'Label-Free Differentiation of Cancer and Non-Cancer Cells Based on Machine-Learning-Algorithm-Assisted Fast Raman Imaging.', 'Raman Imaging and Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy for Diagnosis of Cancer State and Metabolic Monitoring.']"""

Methods C4-2B cells were treated with 0, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800 mmol/L BET. CCK-8 assay was used to assess the cell proliferation, plate cloning formation assay to detect clone formation ability and flow cytometry to evaluate cell apoptosis, and the cell morphological alteration was observed by microscopy. The protein expression of BAX, Bcl2, cleaved caspase 3 (c-caspase-3), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT), and NF-κB p65 were detected by Western blotting, and the changes of BAX, Bcl2, c-caspase-3, and NF-κB p65 proteins were further verified after the cells were treated with NF-κB pathway inhibitor BAY11-7082. Results BET inhibited the proliferation of C4-2B cells in a dose-dependent manner. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 422.7 mmol/L after the cells were treated with BET for 48 hours. Compared with the control group (0 mmol/L BET treatment), the proliferation of C4-2B cells was inhibited along with morphological changes, decreased clone formation ability and increased apoptosis rate in 200, 300, 400 mmol/L BET treated groups. Meanwhile, the protein expression of BAX and c-caspase-3 were up-regulated and Bcl2, PI3K, AKT and NF-κB p65 were down-regulated in 300, 400 mmol/L BET groups as compared with the control group. After BAY11-7082 treatment alone, Bcl2, BAX, c-caspase-3, NF-κB p65 protein expression trend was consistent with that of the 300 mmol/L BET treated group, and Bcl2, NF-κB p65 protein expression levels were lower and BAX and c-caspase-3 protein expression levels were higher in BET combined with BAY11-7082 treated group.

We report our experience of targeted alpha therapy with 225Ac-PSMA-617 in mCRPC patients who have failed therapy with taxanes.  Materials and methods:   Thirty-eight patients with CRPC with progressive disease following at least one taxane-based chemotherapy received 225Ac-PSMA-617 between July 2017 and Nov 2019. Primary end point was a composite 50% PSA and radiological response. Secondary endpoints were PFS, OS, and changes in QOL. The differences in outcomes between patients with skeletal and lymph-node metastases versus those with visceral metastases were also studied.  Results:   A composite response by predetermined criteria was observed in 25 (66%) of 38 patients. The median PFS was 8 months (95% CI 5.3-10.6 months). Median overall survival was 12 months (95% CI 9.1-14.9) with 16 patients alive at the time of censorship. There was no difference in response rates or survival statistics between patients with visceral metastases versus those with only bone and lymph-node metastases (Chi-square 1.51, df 1, Sig 0.218). The most common adverse effect was xerostomia. On the QOL Symptom score, Pain, Fatigue Insomnia, and constipation showed a significant improvement as compared to baseline.

Several studies have proposed the Six Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate 1 (STEAP1) as a promising therapeutic target for prostate cancer. Although structural and functional studies may provide deeper insights on the role of STEAP1 in cancer, such techniques require high amounts of purified protein through biotechnological processes. Based on the results presented, this work proposes the application, for the first time, of a fed-batch profile to improve STEAP1 biosynthesis in mini-bioreactor Komagataella pastoris X-33 Mut+ methanol-induced cultures, by evaluating three glycerol feeding profiles-constant, exponential, and gradient-during the pre-induction phase. Interestingly, different glycerol feeding profiles produced differently processed STEAP1. This platform was optimized using a combination of chemical chaperones for ensuring the structural stabilization and appropriate processing of the target protein. The supplementation of culture medium with 6 % (v/v) DMSO and 1 M proline onto a gradient glycerol/constant methanol feeding promoted increased biosynthesis levels of STEAP1 and minimized aggregation events. Deglycosylation assays with peptide N-glycosidase F showed that glycerol constant feed is associated with an N-glycosylated pattern of STEAP1. The biological activity of recombinant STEAP1 was also validated, once the protein enhanced the proliferation of LNCaP and PC3 cancer cells, in comparison with non-tumoral cell cultures. This methodology could be a crucial starting point for large-scale production of active and stable conformation of recombinant human STEAP1. Thus, it could open up new strategies to unveil the structural rearrangement of STEAP1 and to better understand the biological role of the protein in cancer onset and progression.""","""['D R Duarte#', 'J Barroca-Ferreira#', 'A M Gonçalves', 'F M Santos', 'S M Rocha', 'A Q Pedro', 'C J Maia', 'L A Passarinha']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Appl Microbiol Biotechnol""","""['A chromatographic network for the purification of detergent-solubilized six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 1 from Komagataella pastoris mini-bioreactor lysates.', 'Bioprocess and downstream optimization of recombinant bovine chymosin B in Pichia (Komagataella) pastoris under methanol-inducible AOXI promoter.', 'An artificial neural network for membrane-bound catechol-O-methyltransferase biosynthesis with Pichia pastoris methanol-induced cultures.', 'Integrating metabolic modeling and population heterogeneity analysis into optimizing recombinant protein production by Komagataella (Pichia) pastoris.', 'Recombinant protein production in Pichia pastoris: from transcriptionally redesigned strains to bioprocess optimization and metabolic modelling.', 'Specific Six-Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate 1 Capture with Gellan Gum Microspheres: Design, Optimization and Integration.', 'Enhanced Stability of Detergent-Free Human Native STEAP1 Protein from Neoplastic Prostate Cancer Cells upon an Innovative Isolation Procedure.']"""

The ability to detect somatic mutations in plasma depends on both assay sensitivity and the fraction of circulating DNA in plasma that is tumor-derived (i.e., cfDNA tumor fraction). We hypothesized that cfDNA tumor fraction could inform the interpretation of negative cfDNA results and guide the choice of subsequent assays of greater genomic breadth or depth.  Methods:   Plasma samples collected from 118 metastatic cancer patients were analyzed with cf-IMPACT, a modified version of the FDA-authorized MSK-IMPACT tumor test that can detect genomic alterations in 410 cancer-associated genes. Shallow whole genome sequencing (sWGS) was also performed in the same samples to estimate cfDNA tumor fraction based on genome-wide copy number alterations using z-score statistics. Plasma samples with no somatic alterations detected by cf-IMPACT were triaged based on sWGS-estimated tumor fraction for analysis with either a less comprehensive but more sensitive assay (MSK-ACCESS) or broader whole exome sequencing (WES).  Results:   cfDNA profiling using cf-IMPACT identified somatic mutations in 55/76 (72%) patients for whom MSK-IMPACT tumor profiling data were available. A significantly higher concordance of mutational profiles and tumor mutational burden (TMB) was observed between plasma and tumor profiling for plasma samples with a high tumor fraction (z-score≥5). In the 42 patients from whom tumor data was not available, cf-IMPACT identified mutations in 16/42 (38%). In total, cf-IMPACT analysis of plasma revealed mutations in 71/118 (60%) patients, with clinically actionable alterations identified in 30 (25%), including therapeutic targets of FDA-approved drugs. Of the 47 samples without alterations detected and low tumor fraction (z-score<5), 29 had sufficient material to be re-analyzed using a less comprehensive but more sensitive assay, MSK-ACCESS, which revealed somatic mutations in 14/29 (48%). Conversely, 5 patients without alterations detected by cf-IMPACT and with high tumor fraction (z-score≥5) were analyzed by WES, which identified mutational signatures and alterations in potential oncogenic drivers not covered by the cf-IMPACT panel. Overall, we identified mutations in 90/118 (76%) patients in the entire cohort using the three complementary plasma profiling approaches.  Conclusions:   cfDNA tumor fraction can inform the interpretation of negative cfDNA results and guide the selection of subsequent sequencing platforms that are most likely to identify clinically-relevant genomic alterations.""","""['Dana W Y Tsui#', 'Michael L Cheng#', 'Maha Shady#', 'Julie L Yang#', 'Dennis Stephens', 'Helen Won', 'Preethi Srinivasan', 'Kety Huberman', 'Fanli Meng', 'Xiaohong Jing', 'Juber Patel', 'Maysun Hasan', 'Ian Johnson', 'Erika Gedvilaite', 'Brian Houck-Loomis', 'Nicholas D Socci', 'S Duygu Selcuklu', 'Venkatraman E Seshan', 'Hongxin Zhang', 'Debyani Chakravarty', 'Ahmet Zehir', 'Ryma Benayed', 'Maria Arcila', 'Marc Ladanyi', 'Samuel A Funt', 'Darren R Feldman', 'Bob T Li', 'Pedram Razavi', 'Jonathan Rosenberg', 'Dean Bajorin', 'Gopa Iyer', 'Wassim Abida', 'Howard I Scher', 'Dana Rathkopf', 'Agnes Viale', 'Michael F Berger', 'David B Solit']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Genome Med""","""['Urinary Exosomal and cell-free DNA Detects Somatic Mutation and Copy Number Alteration in Urothelial Carcinoma of Bladder.', 'Utility of Serial cfDNA NGS for Prospective Genomic Analysis of Patients on a Phase I Basket Study.', 'Concordance of Circulating Tumor DNA and Matched Metastatic Tissue Biopsy in Prostate Cancer.', 'Using circulating cell-free DNA to monitor personalized cancer therapy.', 'Liquid biopsy: current technology and clinical applications.', 'An Overview of Circulating Cell-Free Nucleic Acids in Diagnosis and Prognosis of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.', 'Genomic heterogeneity as a barrier to precision oncology in urothelial cancer.', 'Liquid biopsy for children with central nervous system tumours: Clinical integration and technical considerations.', 'Clinical utility of plasma cell-free DNA in gliomas.', 'Circulating Tumor DNA-Based Genomic Profiling Assays in Adult Solid Tumors for Precision Oncology: Recent Advancements and Future Challenges.']"""

The aim of this study is to describe barriers to urologists' recommendation of active surveillance in low-risk prostate cancer and explore variation of barriers by setting.  Methods:   We conducted semi-structured interviews among 22 practicing urologists, evenly distributed between academic and community practice. We coded barriers to active surveillance according to a conceptual model of determinants of treatment quality to identify potential opportunities for intervention.  Results:   Community and academic urologists were generally in agreement on factors influencing active surveillance. Urologists perceived patient-level factors to have the greatest influence on recommendations, particularly tumor pathology, patient age, and judgements about the patient's ability to adhere to follow-up protocols. They also noted cross-cutting clinical barriers, including concerns about the adequacy of biopsy samples, inconsistent protocols to guide active surveillance, and side effects of biopsy procedures. Urologists had differing opinions on the impact of environmental factors, such as financial disincentives and fear of litigation.

At the cellular level, recurrence takes place as a result of reactivation of dormant cancer cells residing at G0 phase. The aim of the study was to identify compounds that can trap prostate and lung cancer cells in G0 phase from a new Chinese herb recipe, Astringent recipe, consisting of Radix Paeoniae Alba, Agrimonia pilosa Ledeb, Fructus Mume, Fritillaria thunbergii Miq., Ganoderma Lucidum Karst, and Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.)

Astringent recipe impeded cell cycle progression in prostate and lung cancer cells by rounding them up at G0 phase by flow cytometric analysis of cancer cells stained with Hoechst 33342 and Pyronin Y, respectively, for DNA and RNA. The anti-cancer efficacy of the recipe was found to be attributable to Agrimonia pilosa Ledeb. Further study established that agrimol B, a polyphenol derived from Agrimonia pilosa Ledeb, contributed to the activity of the herb. The action of agrimol B on the cancer cells was likely derived from its effect on c-MYC, SKP2 and p27 by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence.

Available therapies yield limited outcome. We explored anti-PCa activity in a polyphenol-rich fraction of Bergenia ligulata (PFBL), a plant used in Indian traditional and folk medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic properties. PFBL constituted of about fifteen different compounds as per LCMS analysis induced apoptotic death in both androgen-dependent LNCaP and androgen-refractory PC3 and DU145 cells with little effect on NKE and WI38 cells. Further investigation revealed that PFBL mediates its function through upregulating ROS production by enhanced catalytic activity of Monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A). Notably, the differential inactivation of NRF2-antioxidant response pathway by PFBL resulted in death in PC3 versus NKE cells involving GSK-3β activity facilitated by AKT inhibition. PFBL efficiently reduced the PC3-tumor xenograft in NOD-SCID mice alone and in synergy with Paclitaxel. Tumor tissues in PFBL-treated mice showed upregulation of similar mechanism of cell death as observed in isolated PC3 cells i.e., elevation of MAO-A catalytic activity, ROS production accompanied by activation of β-TrCP-GSK-3β axis of NRF2 degradation. Blood counts, liver, and splenocyte sensitivity analyses justified the PFBL safety in the healthy mice. To our knowledge this is the first report of an activity that crippled NRF2 activation both in vitro and in vivo in response to MAO-A activation.

Objective:   To explore men's information and associated needs for decision making in PSA testing.  Design:   Qualitative interview study.

Main outcome measures:   Men's expressed needs for decision making in PSA testing.  Methods:   All interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed by framework analysis.  Results:   Comprehensive pre-screening counselling is needed. For the men in our study, information about test (in)accuracy, the benefit-harm balance and consequences of the test were relevant and surprising. Additional needs were for interpretation support, a take-home summary and time for deliberation. For several men, their physician's attitude was of interest. After being well-informed, most men felt empowered to make a preference-based decision on their own.  Discussion:   Men were surprised by what they learned, especially regarding the accuracy and possible harms of screening. There is large variation in the breadth and depth of information needed, and some controversy regarding the consequences of testing.  Conclusion and patient contribution:   A core set of information should be offered before men make their first PSA screening decision.

Most men are diagnosed with low grade indolent disease and differentiating these men from those who have life threatening cancer is a challenging but important clinical dilemma. There are currently limited biomarkers that can distinguish between the indolent Gleason grade 6 and higher-grade disease. Moreover, some individuals initially diagnosed with low grade disease progress to higher grade disease. Currently prostate biopsies are the only reliable methods of stratifying risk, but biopsies can cause significant morbidity, sample only a small portion of the gland and are costly. Therefore, biomarkers distinguishing between indolent and aggressive patterns of PCa are urgently required to minimize biopsy-associated morbidity, prevent over-treatment of indolent PCa and to better stratify patients for appropriate treatment.  Methods:   Seminal fluid samples were collected from normal individuals (n = 13) Before infertility treatment and histologically confirmed PCa patients (n = 51). 1 H Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis were used to compare the populations.  Results:   Alterations in amino acids levels, specifically lysine and serine and changes in glycolytic intermediates were the most significant metabolic features associated with differences between healthy controls and PCa and between Gleason grade 6 (GS6) and Gleason grade 7 (GS7) samples. Orthogonal partial least square plots discriminated healthy controls from PCa samples (R 2 = 0.54, Q 2 = 0.31; area under the receiver operating characteristics curve [AUC] = 0.96), and GS6 from GS7 samples (R 2 = 0.62, Q 2 = 0.49; AUC = 0.98) based on lysine and serine content.

Prostate cancer disproportionately affects Black men. To understand how White and Black men reacted to a draft educational pamphlet about the benefits and harms of PSA screening, we conducted race-specific focus groups at a midwestern VA medical center in 2013 and 2015. White and Black men who had been previously screened reviewed the draft pamphlet using a semistructured focus group facilitator guide. Forty-four men, ages 55-81, participated in four White and two Black focus groups. Three universal themes were: low baseline familiarity with prostate cancer, surprise and resistance to the recommendations not to test routinely, and negative emotions in response to ambiguity. Discussions of benefits and harms of screening, as well as intentions for exercising personal agency in prevention and screening, diverged between White and Black focus groups. Discussion in White groups highlighted the potential benefits of screening, minimized the harms, and emphasized personal choice in screening decisions.

In this study, we investigated the cytotoxic mechanism(s) of curcumin against acidity-tolerant prostate cancer PC-3AcT cells in lactic acid-containing medium.  Methods:   Using 2D-monolyer and 3D spheroid culture models, MTT assay, annexin V-PE binding assay, flow cytometric analysis, measurement of ATP content, and Western blot analysis were used for this study.  Results:   At nontoxic concentrations in normal prostate epithelial RWPE-1 and HPrEC cells, curcumin led to strong cytotoxicity in PC-3AcT cells, including increases in sub-G0/G1 peak, annexin V-PE-positive cells, and ROS levels; loss of mitochondrial membrane potential; reduction of cellular ATP content; DNA damage; and concurrent induction of apoptosis and necroptosis. A series of changes induced by curcumin were effectively reversed by reducing ROS levels or replenishing ATP. Pretreatment with apoptosis inhibitor Q-VD-Oph-1 or necroptosis inhibitor necrostatin-1 restored cell viability inhibited by curcumin. Treatment of 3D spheroids with curcumin decreased cell viability, accompanied by an increase in mediators of apoptosis and necroptosis, including cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP, phospho (p)-RIP3, and p-MLKL proteins.  Conclusion:   This study shows that curcumin simultaneously induces apoptosis and necroptosis by oxidative mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent ATP depletion, providing a mechanistic basis for understanding the novel role of curcumin for prostate carcinoma cells.""","""['Yoon-Jin Lee', 'Kwan-Sik Park', 'Sang-Han Lee']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Biomed Res Int""","""['Arctigenin induces necroptosis through mitochondrial dysfunction with CCN1 upregulation in prostate cancer cells under lactic acidosis.', 'ERK1/2-Dependent Inhibition of Glycolysis in Curcumin-Induced Cytotoxicity of Prostate Carcinoma Cells.', 'Arctigenin shows preferential cytotoxicity to acidity-tolerant prostate carcinoma PC-3\u202fcells through ROS-mediated mitochondrial damage and the inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.', 'Increased Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species Mediates the Anti-Cancer Effects of WZ35 via Activating Mitochondrial Apoptosis Pathway in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Apoptotic death in curcumin-treated NPC-TW 076 human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells is mediated through the ROS, mitochondrial depolarization and caspase-3-dependent signaling responses.', 'Curcumin alleviates experimental colitis in mice by suppressing necroptosis of intestinal epithelial cells.', 'Cytotoxic Activity of Amaryllidaceae Plants against Cancer Cells: Biotechnological, In Vitro, and In Silico Approaches.', ""Let's Go 3D!

We sought to understand the underlying mechanism of PCa chemoresistance and discover new treatments to overcome docetaxel resistance. Methods: We developed a novel phenotypic screening platform for the discovery of specific inhibitors of chemoresistant PCa cells. The mechanism of action of the lead compound was investigated using computational, molecular and cellular approaches. The in vivo toxicity and efficacy of the lead compound were evaluated in clinically-relevant animal models. Results: We identified LG1980 as a lead compound that demonstrates high selectivity and potency against chemoresistant PCa cells. Mechanistically, LG1980 binds embryonic ectoderm development (EED), disrupts the interaction between EED and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), thereby inducing the protein degradation of EZH2 and inhibiting the phosphorylation and activity of EZH2. Consequently, LG1980 targets a survival signaling cascade consisting of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3), S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2), ATP binding cassette B 1 (ABCB1) and survivin. As a lead compound, LG1980 is well tolerated in mice and effectively suppresses the in vivo growth of chemoresistant PCa and synergistically enhances the efficacy of docetaxel in xenograft models. Conclusions: These results indicate that pharmacological inhibition of EED-EZH2 interaction is a novel strategy for the treatment of chemoresistant PCa.

This study aims to establish a drug delivery system combining PDT and chemotherapy to show that chemotherapeutic drugs provide oxygen to PDT, while PDT promotes the release of chemotherapeutic drug.  Methods:   Firstly, poly(ethylene glycol)-lysine(Ce6)-block-poly(L-glutamate)-imidazole (mPEG-lys(Ce6)-PGA-AIM) was synthesized and self-assembled into micelles that exhibited pH- and ROS-responsiveness and buffering capacity. Perfluorohexanoate-modified cisplatin (FCP), as oxygen carriers, was encapsulated into mPEG-lys(Ce6)-PGA-AIM micelles. Then, the properties of micelles and their biological functions in vivo and in vitro were investigated.  Results:   The micelles exhibited remarkabe stability, pH regulated drug release, good biocompatibility and effective tumor penetration. Cellular uptake demonstrated the efficient endosome/lysosome escape of CFMs, which facilitates the intracellular drug release. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments reflected that CFMs with laser irradiation showed significantly improved therapeutic activity compared with single PDT or chemotherapy.

Our framework can automatically resolve complex SVs, reconstruct local Hi-C maps surrounding the breakpoints, normalize copy number variation and allele effects and predict chromatin loops induced by SVs. We applied NeoLoopFinder in Hi-C data from 50 cancer cell lines and primary tumors and identified tens of recurrent genes associated with enhancer hijacking. To experimentally validate NeoLoopFinder, we deleted the hijacked enhancers in prostate adenocarcinoma cells using CRISPR-Cas9, which significantly reduced expression of the target oncogene.

Patients and methods:   Biochemical recurrence (BCR) free survival, metastasis free survival (MFS), and cancer specific survival (CSS) were stratified according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk categories, pT, and pN stages, RP Gleason Grade Groups (GGG), and surgical margin status (R0/R1). For time to event analyses, uni- and multivariable Cox's proportional hazards models and univariable Kaplan-Meier analyses were applied.  Results:   Median follow up was 68 months. Most favourable 20-year survival rates were exhibited in NCCN low risk (78.7% BCR-free, 96.8% MFS, 90.1% CSS) and pT2, GGG 1 to 2, R0 patients (83.1% BCR-free, 96.7% MFS, 92.6% CSS). 20-year follow up was not constantly reached in patients with aggressive CaP features. For example, NCCN very high-risk patients exhibited 15-year BCR-free survival of 30.5%, while 20-year MFS and CSS in these individuals was reached (64.1% and 60.8%, respectively). Lowest 10-year BCR-free survival (35.6%) was exhibited in pT3b, GGG 4 to 5, R0. Lowest 10-year MFS (49.5%) was exhibited in pT2, GGG 4 to 5, R1.

Moreover, several investigators observed worse outcomes in unmarried males, but not in females. This concept has not been tested in upper tract urothelial carcinoma and represents the topic of the study.  Methods:   Within Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database (2004-2016), we identified 8833 non-metastatic upper tract urothelial carcinoma patients treated with radical nephroureterectomy (5208 males vs. 3625 females). Kaplan Meier plots and multivariable Cox regression models predicting overall mortality, other-cause mortality and cancer-specific mortality were used.  Results:   Overall, 1323 males (25.4%) and 1986 females (54.8%) were unmarried. Except for lower rates of chemotherapy in unmarried males (15.6 vs. 19.6%, P = 0.001) and unmarried females (13.8 vs. 23.6%, P < 0.001), no clinically meaningful differences were recorded between males and females. In multivariable Cox regression models, unmarried status was an independent predictor of higher overall mortality in both males (Hazard ratio [HR]: 1.33, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19-1.48, P < 0.001) and females (HR: 1.13, 95%CI: 1.00-1.27, P = 0.04), as well as of higher other-cause mortality in both males (HR: 1.53, 95%CI: 1.26-1.84,P < 0.001) and females (HR: 1.43, 95%CI: 1.15-1.78,P < 0.01). However, higher cancer-specific mortality was only recorded in unmarried males (HR: 1.24, 95%CI: 1.08-1.42, P < 0.01), but not in females (HR: 1.02, 95%CI: 0.89-1.17, P = 0.7).  Conclusion:   Unmarried status is a marker of worse survival in both males and females and should be flagged as an important risk factor at diagnosis, in both sexes.

Objective:   Our objective was to examine the prevalence of ""manels"" or all-male speaking panels at urological meetings.  Design, setting, and participants:   Urology meetings organized by major urological associations/societies from December 2019 to November 2020 were reviewed. Meeting information and details of the faculty were retrieved.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Primary outcomes were: (1) the percentage of male faculty in all included sessions and (2) the overall proportion of manels. We made further comparisons between manel and multigender sessions. Male and female faculty were stratified by quartiles of publications, citations, and H-index, and their mean numbers of sessions were compared.  Results and limitations:   Among 285 meeting sessions, 181 (63.5%) were manels. The mean percentage of male faculty was 86.9%. Male representation was very high in urology meetings for most disciplines and urological associations/societies, except for female urology meeting sessions and those organized by the International Continence Society. Nonmanel sessions had higher numbers of chairs/moderators (p = 0.027), speakers (p < 0.001), and faculty (p < 0.001) than manel sessions. A total of 1037 faculty members were included, and 900 of them (86.8%) were male. Male faculty had longer mean years of practice (23.8 vs 17.7 yr, p < 0.001) and was more likely to include professors (43.2% vs 17.5%, p < 0.001) than female faculty. Male faculty within the first quartile (ie, lower quartile) of publications and H-index had a significantly higher number of sessions than female faculty within the same quartile.  Conclusions:   Our study showed that manels are prevalent in urology meetings. There is evidence showing that males received more opportunities than females. A huge gender imbalance exists in urology meetings; urological associations and societies should actively strive for greater gender parity.  Patient summary:   Women are under-represented in urology meetings. Urological associations and societies should play an active role to ensure a more balanced gender representation.""","""['Jeremy Yuen-Chun Teoh', 'Daniele Castellani', 'Claudia Mercader', 'Alba Sierra', 'Flavio L Heldwein', 'Erica On-Ting Chan', 'Marcelo L Wroclawski', 'Fabio Sepulveda', 'Giovanni E Cacciamani', 'Juan Gomez Rivas', 'Declan G Murphy', 'Inge M van Oort', 'Stacy Loeb', 'Maria J Ribal']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Addressing Equality of Representation in Urology Societies.', 'The European Urology Commitment to Gender Equity and Diversity: Expanding Cognitive Diversity through Inclusivity at the Podium.', 'Reply to Laurence Klotz\'s Letter to the Editor re: Jeremy Yuen-Chun Teoh, Daniele Castellani, Claudia Mercader, et al.

An approximately optimal dose distribution corresponding to a specific patient's anatomy can be predicted by using pre-trained deep learning (DL) models. However, dose distributions are often optimized based not only on patient-specific anatomy but also on physicians' preferred trade-offs between planning target volume (PTV) coverage and organ at risk (OAR) sparing or among different OARs. Therefore, it is desirable to allow physicians to fine-tune the dose distribution predicted based on patient anatomy. In this work, we developed a DL model to predict the individualized 3D dose distributions by using not only the patient's anatomy but also the desired PTV/OAR trade-offs, as represented by a dose volume histogram (DVH), as inputs.  Methods:   In this work, we developed a modified U-Net network to predict the 3D dose distribution by using patient PTV/OAR masks and the desired DVH as inputs. The desired DVH, fine-tuned by physicians from the initially predicted DVH, is first projected onto the Pareto surface, then converted into a vector, and then concatenated with feature maps encoded from the PTV/OAR masks. The network output for training is the dose distribution corresponding to the Pareto optimal DVH. The training/validation datasets contain 77 prostate cancer patients, and the testing dataset has 20 patients.  Results:   The trained model can predict a 3D dose distribution that is approximately Pareto optimal while having the DVH closest to the input desired DVH. We calculated the difference between the predicted dose distribution and the optimized dose distribution that has a DVH closest to the desired one for the PTV and for all OARs as a quantitative evaluation. The largest absolute error in mean dose was about 3.6% of the prescription dose, and the largest absolute error in the maximum dose was about 2.0% of the prescription dose.  Conclusions:   In this feasibility study, we have developed a 3D U-Net model with the patient's anatomy and the desired DVH curves as inputs to predict an individualized 3D dose distribution that is approximately Pareto optimal while having the DVH closest to the desired one. The predicted dose distributions can be used as references for dosimetrists and physicians to rapidly develop a clinically acceptable treatment plan.""","""['Jianhui Ma', 'Dan Nguyen', 'Ti Bai', 'Michael Folkerts', 'Xun Jia', 'Weiguo Lu', 'Linghong Zhou', 'Steve Jiang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Using deep learning to predict beam-tunable Pareto optimal dose distribution for intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Incorporating human and learned domain knowledge into training deep neural networks: A differentiable dose-volume histogram and adversarial inspired framework for generating Pareto optimal dose distributions in radiation therapy.', 'Site-agnostic 3D dose distribution prediction with deep learning neural networks.', 'Evaluation of dose-volume histogram prediction for organ-at risk and planning target volume based on machine learning.', 'A focused review of statistical practices for relating radiation dose-volume exposure and toxicity.', 'Advances in Automated Treatment Planning.', 'A Survey on Deep Learning for Precision Oncology.', 'Dose Prediction Using a Three-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma With Tomotherapy.']"""

We used the enhanced medical/health data mining tool ConSoRe to search aggregated data, analyze electronic patient records (EPR), and better characterize patients with SPC.  Methods:   This retrospective cohort study used ConSoRe to identify EPRs from patients with SPC referred to the regional cancer center Leon Bérard from 1993 to 2017, and examined characteristics of patients with SPC, frequencies of first primary cancer (FPC) localization in the global population of patients with SPC, and time to SPC. Data set was extracted on January 1, 2018.  Results:   Among 296,530 EPRs, we identified 157,187 patients with FPC, including 13,002 (8%) patients with SPC. Between 2000 and 2010, the rate of SPC was 34%, and 52% of SPC were identified in the last years (2010-2017). In men, main cancers were head and neck cancer, lymphoma, and prostate carcinoma accounting for 15.6%, 12.8%, and 10.5% of FPC, while the three most common SPC were head and neck cancer (13.2%), lung cancer (11.8%) and lymphoma (9.2%). In women, breast cancers, lymphoma, and skin cancers accounted for 48.8%, 8%, and 5.1% of first cancers, and for 31.1%, 7% and 6% of SPC.

This study aims to determine the detection rate and diagnostic accuracy of 18F-fluciclovine PET and the patterns of prostate cancer recurrence in patients with rising PSA after initial radiation therapy, particularly in patients with PSA levels below the accepted Phoenix definition of BCR (PSA nadir +2 ng/mL).  Methods:   This retrospective study included patients from two tertiary institutions who underwent 18F-fluciclovine PET scans for elevated PSA level following initial external beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, and/or proton therapy. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of 18F-fluciclovine PET and associations of PSA kinetic parameters with 18F-fluciclovine PET outcome.  Results:   One hundred patients were included in this study. The overall detection rate on a patient-level was 79% (79/100). 18F-Fluciclovine PET was positive in 62% (23/37) of cases with PSA below the Phoenix criteria. The positive predictive value of 18F-fluciclovine PET was 89% (95% CI: 80-94%). In patients with PSA below the Phoenix criteria, the PSA velocity had the highest predictive value of 18F-fluciclovine PET outcome. PSA doubling time (PSADT) and PSA velocity were associated with the presence of extra-pelvic metastatic disease.  Conclusion: 18F-Fluciclovine PET can identify recurrent disease at low PSA level and PSA rise below accepted Phoenix criteria in patients with suspected BCR after primary radiation therapy, particularly in patients with low PSADT or high PSA velocity. In patients with low PSADT or high PSA velocity, there is an increased probability of extra-pelvic metastases. Therefore, these patients are more likely to benefit from PET/CT or PET/MRI than pelvic MRI alone.""","""['Ali Salavati', 'Mehmet Gencturk', 'Yasemin Koksel', 'Allyssa N Schik', 'Peter R Carroll', 'Felix Y Feng', 'Steven P Rowe', 'Courtney Lawhn-Heath', 'Thomas A Hope', 'Jerry W Froelich']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', '18F-rhPSMA-7 PET for the Detection of Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer After Curative-Intent Radiation Therapy: A Bicentric Retrospective Study.', 'The Clinical Utility of 18F-Fluciclovine PET/CT in Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer: an Academic Center Experience Post FDA Approval.', 'Fluorine-18-Labeled Fluciclovine PET/CT in Primary and Biochemical Recurrent Prostate Cancer Management.', 'Markers and meaning of primary treatment failure.', 'Complex implementation factors demonstrated when evaluating cost-effectiveness and monitoring racial disparities associated with 18FDCFPyL PET/CT in prostate cancer men.', 'Impact of 18 F-Fluciclovine PET/CT Findings on Failure-Free Survival in Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer Following Salvage Radiation Therapy.', 'Differences in Failure-Free Survival After Salvage Radiotherapy Guided by Conventional Imaging Versus 18F-Fluciclovine PET/CT in Postprostatectomy Patients: A Post Hoc Substratification Analysis of the EMPIRE-1 Trial.', 'Management Impact of Metachronous Oligometastatic Disease Identified on 18F-Fluciclovine (Axumin™) PET/CT in Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'Detection Rate and Clinical Impact of PET/CT with 18F-FACBC in Patients with Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer: A Retrospective Bicentric Study.']"""

According to the 2020 Surgeon General's report, smoking cessation may reduce CM but supporting evidence is not wide. Use of deep learning-based modeling that enables universal natural language processing of medical narratives to acquire population-based real-life smoking data may help overcome the challenge. We assessed the effect of smoking status and within-1-year smoking cessation on CM by an in-house adapted freely available language processing algorithm.  Materials and methods:   This cross-sectional real-world study included 29 823 patients diagnosed with cancer in 2009-2018 in Southwest Finland. The medical narrative, International Classification of Diseases-10th edition codes, histology, cancer treatment records, and death certificates were combined. Over 162 000 sentences describing tobacco smoking behavior were analyzed with ULMFiT and BERT algorithms.  Results:   The language model classified the smoking status of 23 031 patients. Recent quitters had reduced CM [hazard ratio (HR) 0.80 (0.74-0.87)] and OM [HR 0.78 (0.72-0.84)] compared to persistent smokers. Compared to never smokers, persistent smokers had increased CM in head and neck, gastro-esophageal, pancreatic, lung, prostate, and breast cancer and Hodgkin's lymphoma, irrespective of age, comorbidities, performance status, or presence of metastatic disease. Increased CM was also observed in smokers with colorectal cancer, men with melanoma or bladder cancer, and lymphoid and myeloid leukemia, but no longer independently of the abovementioned covariates. Specificity and sensitivity were 96%/96%, 98%/68%, and 88%/99% for never, former, and current smokers, respectively, being essentially the same with both models.  Conclusions:   Deep learning can be used to classify large amounts of smoking data from the medical narrative with good accuracy.

Methods:   To systematically determine E-Cadherin protein expression in normal and cancerous tissues, 14,637 tumor samples from 112 different tumor types and subtypes as well as 608 samples of 76 different normal tissue types were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in a tissue microarray format.  Results:   E-Cadherin was strongly expressed in normal epithelial cells of most organs. From 77 tumor entities derived from cell types normally positive for E-Cadherin, 35 (45.5%) retained at least a weak E-Cadherin immunostaining in ≥99% of cases and 61 (79.2%) in ≥90% of cases. Tumors with the highest rates of E-Cadherin loss included Merkel cell carcinoma, anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, lobular carcinoma of the breast, and sarcomatoid and small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas of the urinary bladder. Reduced E-Cadherin expression was linked to higher grade (p = 0.0009), triple negative receptor status (p = 0.0336), and poor prognosis (p = 0.0466) in invasive breast carcinoma of no special type, triple negative receptor status in lobular carcinoma of the breast (p = 0.0454), advanced pT stage (p = 0.0047) and lymph node metastasis in colorectal cancer (p < 0.0001), and was more common in recurrent than in primary prostate cancer (p < 0.0001). Of 29 tumor entities derived from E-Cadherin negative normal tissues, a weak to strong E-Cadherin staining could be detected in at least 10% of cases in 15 different tumor entities (51.7%). Tumors with the highest frequency of E-Cadherin upregulation included various subtypes of testicular germ cell tumors and renal cell carcinomas (RCC). E-Cadherin upregulation was more commonly seen in malignant than in benign soft tissue tumors (p = 0.0104) and was associated with advanced tumor stage (p = 0.0276) and higher grade (p = 0.0035) in clear cell RCC, and linked to advanced tumor stage (p = 0.0424) and poor prognosis in papillary RCC (p ≤ 0.05).  Conclusion:   E-Cadherin is consistently expressed in various epithelial cancers. Down-regulation or loss of E-Cadherin expression in cancers arising from E-Cadherin positive tissues as well as E-Cadherin neo-expression in cancers arising from E-Cadherin negative tissues is linked to cancer progression and may reflect tumor dedifferentiation.""","""['Eike Burandt', 'Felix Lübbersmeyer', 'Natalia Gorbokon', 'Franziska Büscheck', 'Andreas M Luebke', 'Anne Menz', 'Martina Kluth', 'Claudia Hube-Magg', 'Andrea Hinsch', 'Doris Höflmayer', 'Sören Weidemann', 'Christoph Fraune', 'Katharina Möller', 'Frank Jacobsen', 'Patrick Lebok', 'Till Sebastian Clauditz', 'Guido Sauter', 'Ronald Simon', 'Ria Uhlig', 'Waldemar Wilczak', 'Stefan Steurer', 'Sarah Minner', 'Rainer Krech', 'David Dum', 'Till Krech', 'Andreas Holger Marx', 'Christian Bernreuther']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Biomark Res""","""['Diagnostic and prognostic impact of cytokeratin 18 expression in human tumors: a tissue microarray study on 11,952 tumors.', 'Expression of sialyl lewis X, sialyl Lewis A, E-cadherin and cathepsin-D in human breast cancer: immunohistochemical analysis in mammary carcinoma in situ, invasive carcinomas and their lymph node metastasis.', 'E-cadherin expression in prostate cancer: a broad survey using high-density tissue microarray technology.', 'Anomalous expression of P-cadherin in breast carcinoma.

We address here the problem of variant detection between two deep-sequencing (DNA-seq) samples, such as two human samples from an individual patient, or two samples from distinct bacterial strains. The preferred strategy in such a case is to align each sample to a common reference genome, collect all variants and compare these variants between samples. Such mapping-based protocols have several limitations. DNA sequences with large indels, aggregated mutations and structural variants are hard to map to the reference. Furthermore, DNA sequences cannot be mapped reliably to genomic low complexity regions and repeats.  Results:   We introduce 2-kupl, a k-mer based, mapping-free protocol to detect variants between two DNA-seq samples. On simulated and actual data, 2-kupl achieves higher accuracy than other mapping-free protocols. Applying 2-kupl to prostate cancer whole exome sequencing data, we identify a number of candidate variants in hard-to-map regions and propose potential novel recurrent variants in this disease.  Conclusions:   We developed a mapping-free protocol for variant calling between matched DNA-seq samples.

Here, we hypothesize that targeting the CD146 with low-dose gold nanorods combined with mild hyperthermia can stop the migration of these cancer cells. Two metastatic cancer cells including a melanoma and a breast cancer cell line are selected as the model systems. Cell migration assays show that the migration of both cell lines can be completely stopped by the treatment. Atomic force microscopy and super resolution fluorescence microscopy reveal the alterations of actin cytoskeleton and cell morphology correspond to the inhibited cell migration. Further mechanistic analysis indicates the treatment disrupts the actin cytoskeleton by a synergistic mechanism including depleting membrane CD146 and interfering ezrin-radixin-moesin phosphorylation. As a result, we believe targeting CD146 with low-dose gold nanorods and mild hyperthermia could be a versatile, effective, and safe approach for stopping cancer metastasis. More broadly, the concept of targeting cancer cell surface markers that connect the underlying actin cytoskeleton, offers enormous potential in treating cancer metastasis, which accounts for more than 90% of cancer-associated mortality.""","""['Jinyuan Liu', 'Lin Kang', 'Ishara Ratnayake', 'Phil Ahrenkiel', 'Steve Smith', 'Congzhou Wang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Colloid Interface Sci""","""['Transmembrane MUC18 Targeted Polydopamine Nanoparticles and a Mild Photothermal Effect Synergistically Disrupt Actin Cytoskeleton and Migration of Cancer Cells.', 'Targeting cancer cell integrins using gold nanorods in photothermal therapy inhibits migration through affecting cytoskeletal proteins.', 'CD146 expression is associated with a poor prognosis in human breast tumors and with enhanced motility in breast cancer cell lines.', 'CD146, from a melanoma cell adhesion molecule to a signaling receptor.', 'Advances of the Role of Ezrin in Migration and Invasion of Breast Cancer Cells.', 'The Prognostic Value and the Oncogenic and Immunological Roles of Vacuolar Protein Sorting Associated Protein 26 A in Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.', 'Magnetite Nanoparticles in Magnetic Hyperthermia and Cancer Therapies: Challenges and Perspectives.']"""

Clinical evidence is lacking and it therefore remains uncertain whether MR-Linac is cost-effective. An early health economic analysis was performed to calculate the necessary relative reduction in complications and the maximum price of MR-Linac (5 fractions) to be cost-effective compared to 5, 20 and 39 fractionation schedules of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy.  Materials and methods:   A state transition model was developed for men with localized prostate cancer. Complication rates such as grade ≥2 urinary, grade ≥2 bowel and sexual complications, and utilities were based on systematic literature searches. Costs were estimated from a Dutch healthcare perspective. Threshold analyses were performed to identify the thresholds of complications and costs for MR-Linac to be cost-effective, while holding other outcomes such as biochemical progression and mortality constant. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed to outline uncertainty outcomes.  Results:   At €6460 per patient, no reductions in complications were needed to consider MR-Linac cost-effective compared to EBRT 20 and 39 fractions. Compared to EBRT 5 fractions and LDR brachytherapy, MR-Linac was found to be cost-effective when complications are relatively reduced by 54% and 66% respectively. Results are highly sensitive to the utilities of urinary, bowel and sexual complications and the probability of biochemical progression.  Conclusions:   MR-Linac is found to be cost-effective compared to 20 and 39 fractions EBRT at baseline. For MR-Linac to become cost-effective over 5 fractions EBRT and LDR brachytherapy, it has to reduce complications substantially or be offered at lower costs.""","""['Charisma Hehakaya', 'Jochem R N van der Voort van Zyp', 'Ben G L Vanneste', 'Janneke P C Grutters', 'Diederick E Grobbee', 'Helena M Verkooijen', 'Geert W J Frederix']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Comparison of Patient-reported Outcomes After External Beam Radiation Therapy and Combined External Beam With Low-dose-rate Brachytherapy Boost in Men With Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Acute genitourinary toxicity after high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: correlation between the urethral dose in HDR brachytherapy and the severity of acute genitourinary toxicity.', 'Toxicity reduction required for MRI-guided radiotherapy to be cost-effective in the treatment of localized prostate cancer.', 'Low-dose rate brachytherapy for men with localized prostate cancer.', 'Brachytherapy: current status and future strategies -- can high dose rate replace low dose rate and external beam radiotherapy?', 'Clinical application of MR-Linac in tumor radiotherapy: a systematic review.', 'Adaptive radiotherapy for breast cancer.', 'Adaptive magnetic resonance image guided radiation for intact localized prostate cancer how to optimally test a rapidly emerging technology.', 'Emergence of MR-Linac in Radiation Oncology: Successes and Challenges of Riding on the MRgRT Bandwagon.', 'Economic Evaluations of Magnetic Resonance Image-Guided Radiotherapy (MRIgRT): A Systematic Review.']"""

In the present study, changes in cognitive performance and structural brain connectomes in PC patients undergoing ADT were assessed, and associations of cognitive changes with endocrine status and risk genotypes were explored.  Methods:   Thirty-seven PC patients underwent cognitive assessment, structural MRI, and provided blood samples prior to ADT and after 6 months of treatment. Twenty-seven age- and education-matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent the same assessments. CD was determined using a standardized regression-based approach and defined as z-scores ≤ -1.64. Changes in brain connectomes were evaluated using graph theory. Associations of CD with testosterone levels and genotypes (APOE, COMT, BDNF) were explored.  Results:   Compared with HCs, PC patients demonstrated reduced testosterone levels (p < 0.01) and higher rates of decline for 13 out of 15 cognitive outcomes, with three outcomes related to two cognitive domains, i.e., verbal memory and visuospatial learning and memory, reaching statistical significance (p ≤ 0.01-0.04). Testosterone level changes did not predict CD. COMT Met homozygote PC patients evidenced larger reductions in visuospatial memory compared with Val carriers (p = 0.02). No between-group differences were observed in brain connectomes across time, and no effects were found of APOE and BDNF.  Conclusions:   Our results indicate that PC patients undergoing ADT may evidence CD, and that COMT Met homozygotes may be at increased risk of CD.

To investigate this relationship, we generated the first prostate m6A maps, and further examined how METTL3 regulates expression at the level of transcription, translation, and protein. Significantly, transcripts encoding extracellular matrix proteins are consistently upregulated with METTL3 knockdown. We also examined the relationship between METTL3 and androgen signaling and discovered the upregulation of a hepatocyte nuclear factor-driven gene signature that is associated with therapy resistance in prostate cancer. Significantly, METTL3 knockdown rendered the cells resistant to androgen receptor antagonists via an androgen receptor-independent mechanism driven by the upregulation of nuclear receptor NR5A2/LRH-1.

USPSTF recommended against screening men aged ≥70 years. We aim to generate county-level prevalence estimates, masked by national and state estimates, to identify counties with high PSA screening prevalence.  Methods:   We fitted multilevel logistic regression mixed models for 4 age groups (≥40, 40 to 54, 55 to 69, ≥70 years), using data from the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) (n = 116,654) and other sources. We evaluated consistency between our model-based state and BRFSS direct state estimates with Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficients.  Results:   PSA screening prevalence increased with increasing age groups: 7.7% for men aged 40 to 54 years, 27.2% for men aged 55 to 69 years, and 33.7% among men age ≥70 years, and was largely clustered in the South and Appalachia.

We analyzed whether pretherapeutic kidney function is predictive of subsequent kidney dose and to what extent the cumulative kidney dose at the end of multiple therapy cycles can be predicted from a dosimetry based on the first cycle. Methods: Data of 59 patients treated with at least 2 cycles of 177Lu-PSMA-617 (PSMA RLT) were analyzed. Treatment (median, 6 GBq/cycle) was performed at 6- to 8-wk intervals, accompanied by voxel-based 3-dimensional dosimetry (measured kidney dose) with SPECT/CT on each of days 0-3 and once during days 6-9. Pretherapeutic kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate, mercaptoacetyltriglycine clearance) was correlated to the kidney doses. Cumulative kidney doses at the end of treatment were compared with a dose estimated from the population-based mean kidney dose, individual first-cycle kidney dose, and mean kidney doses of cycles 1, 3, and 5 per administered activity. Results: In total, 176 PSMA RLT cycles were performed, with a median of 3 cycles per patient. The average kidney dose per administered activity of all 176 cycles was 0.67 ± 0.24 Gy/GBq (range, 0.21-1.60 Gy/GBq). Mercaptoacetyltriglycine clearance and estimated glomerular filtration rate were no reliable predictors of subsequent absorbed kidney dose and showed only small effect sizes (R 2 = 0.080 and 0.014 [P = 0.039 and 0.375], respectively). All simplified estimations of cumulative kidney dose correlated significantly (P < 0.001) with measured kidney doses: estimations based on the individual first-cycle dose were more accurate than the use of the population-based average kidney dose (R 2 = 0.853 vs. 0.560). Dose estimation was best when the doses of cycles 3 and 5 were included as well (R 2 = 0.960). Conclusion: Pretherapeutic renal function was not predictive of subsequent kidney dose during therapy. Extrapolation of individual data from dosimetry of the first cycle was highly predictive of the cumulative kidney dose at the end of treatment. This prediction was further improved by the integration of dose information from every other cycle.

Methods: A small series of 125I-labeled compounds was synthesized from tin precursors to evaluate the effect of the location of the radiohalogen within the molecule and the presence of lutetium in the chelate on biodistribution. On that basis, 211At-3-Lu was selected and evaluated in cell uptake and internalization studies, and biodistribution and PSMA-expressing (PSMA+) PC3 PIP tumor growth control were evaluated in experimental flank and metastatic (PC3-ML-Luc) models. A long-term (13-mo) toxicity study was performed for 211At-3-Lu, including tissue chemistries and histopathology. Results: The radiochemical yield of 211At-3-Lu was 17.8% ± 8.2%. Lead compound 211At-3-Lu demonstrated total uptake within PSMA+ PC3 PIP cells of 13.4 ± 0.5% of the input dose after 4 h of incubation, with little uptake in control cells. In SCID mice, 211At-3-Lu provided uptake that was 30.6 ± 4.8 percentage injected dose per gram (%ID/g) in PSMA+ PC3 PIP tumor at 1 h after injection, and this uptake decreased to 9.46 ± 0.96 %ID/g by 24 h.

Dose-dependent survival was demonstrated at higher doses (>1.48 MBq) in both flank and metastatic models. There was little off-target toxicity, as demonstrated by hematopoietic stability, unchanged tissue chemistries, weight gain rather than loss throughout treatment, and favorable histopathologic findings.

Therefore, the development of novel and effective therapies for mCRPC represents an urgent medical need. T cell engagers (TCEs) have emerged as a promising approach for the treatment of mCRPC due to their targeted mechanism of action. However, challenges remain in the clinic due to the limited efficacy of TCEs observed thus far in solid tumors as well as the toxicities associated with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) due to the usage of high-affinity anti-CD3 moieties such as OKT3.  Methods:   Using genetically engineered transgenic rats (UniRat and OmniFlic) that express fully human IgG antibodies together with an NGS-based antibody discovery pipeline, we developed TNB-585, an anti-CD3xPSMA TCE for the treatment of mCRPC. TNB-585 pairs a tumor-targeting anti-PSMA arm together with a unique, low-affinity anti-CD3 arm in bispecific format. We tested TNB-585 in T cell-redirected cytotoxicity assays against PSMA+ tumor cells in both two-dimensional (2D) cultures and three-dimensional (3D) spheroids as well as against patient-derived prostate tumor cells. Cytokines were measured in culture supernatants to assess the ability of TNB-585 to induce tumor killing with low cytokine release. TNB-585-mediated T cell activation, proliferation, and cytotoxic granule formation were measured to investigate the mechanism of action. Additionally, TNB-585 efficacy was evaluated in vivo against C4-2 tumor-bearing NCG mice.  Results:   In vitro, TNB-585 induced activation and proliferation of human T cells resulting in the killing of PSMA+ prostate tumor cells in both 2D cultures and 3D spheroids with minimal cytokine release and reduced regulatory T cell activation compared with a positive control antibody that contains the same anti-PSMA arm but a higher affinity anti-CD3 arm (comparable with OKT3). In addition, TNB-585 demonstrated potent efficacy against patient-derived prostate tumors ex vivo and induced immune cell infiltration and dose-dependent tumor regression in vivo.  Conclusions:   Our data suggest that TNB-585, with its low-affinity anti-CD3, may be efficacious while inducing a lower incidence and severity of CRS in patients with prostate cancer compared with TCEs that incorporate high-affinity anti-CD3 domains.""","""['Kevin Dang', 'Giulia Castello', 'Starlynn C Clarke', 'Yuping Li', 'Aarti Balasubramani', 'Andrew Boudreau', 'Laura Davison', 'Katherine E Harris', 'Duy Pham', 'Preethi Sankaran', 'Harshad S Ugamraj', 'Rong Deng', 'Serena Kwek', 'Alec Starzinski', 'Suhasini Iyer', 'Wim van Schooten', 'Ute Schellenberger', 'Wenchao Sun', 'Nathan D Trinklein', 'Roland Buelow', 'Ben Buelow', 'Lawrence Fong', 'Pranjali Dalvi']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Immunother Cancer""","""['The PSMA-targeting Half-life Extended BiTE Therapy AMG 160 has Potent Antitumor Activity in Preclinical Models of Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'A PSMA-Targeting CD3 Bispecific Antibody Induces Antitumor Responses that Are Enhanced by 4-1BB Costimulation.', 'MOR209/ES414, a Novel Bispecific Antibody Targeting PSMA for the Treatment of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Efficacy Against Human Prostate Cancer by Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-specific, Transforming Growth Factor-β Insensitive Genetically Targeted CD8+ T-cells Derived from Patients with Metastatic Castrate-resistant Disease.', 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Directed Therapy for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Population dynamics of immunological synapse formation induced by bispecific T cell engagers predict clinical pharmacodynamics and treatment resistance.', ""Let's Go 3D!

In multivariate analysis (AUC = 0.801; P < .001), they were more frequent in Castilla y León: grade i rectal examination, non-palpable rectal examination, Gleason < 6, stage T2c and the volume cylinder ratio < 6 (only in < 64 years: OR 5.2; 95% CI 1.2-22-22.3; P = .027). In Spanish regions, volume cylinder ratio showed inverse correlation with IR in < 74 years, while age showed positive correlation in all age groups.  Conclusions:   The higher prostate cancer IR in Castilla y León in 2010 was not associated to an older population. However, the biopsy technique influenced IR, as more cylinders were obtained in younger subjects, without conditioning overdiagnosis.""","""['M I Gutiérrez-Pérez', 'M González-Sagrado', 'R Conde-Vicente', 'J H Amón-Sesmero']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Actas Urol Esp (Engl Ed)""","""['Actual incidence of prostate cancer in healthcare areas of the autonomous community of Castilla-Leon during 2014.

Material and methods:   Retrospective analysis of 516 patients on AS after prostate cancer diagnosis. Population divided into ""per-protocol"" vs ""induced"" AS depending on fulfilment of protocol´s inclusion criteria. Radical prostatectomies after AS were selected and stratified based on: reclassification, progression or patient anxiety. Clinicopathological features and biochemical relapse-free survival were studied. Primary endpoint was overtreatment ratio based on the presence of insignificant prostate cancer and adverse pathological features in the surgical specimen. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate the biochemical relapse-free survival and compared with log-rank test.  Results:   304 patients fulfilled inclusion criteria; 100 proceeded to radical prostatectomy (31% ""induced"", 69% ""per-protocol"" AS). Surgery indications were reclassification, progression and anxiety in 66%, 18% and 16% of patients respectively. Rate of positive lymph nodes was higher in the progression group (11%) compared to reclassification and anxiety (5% and 0% respectively, P = .002). Positive surgical margins were more frequently reported in the progression cohort compared to reclassification (28% vs 20%). Median follow-up from diagnosis until last radical prostatectomy was 48.3 months (32.4-70). 3 year biochemical relapse-free survival in the salvage radical prostatectomy was 85.4% (95 CI 78.3-93.2). Insignificant cancer was noticed in 7% of patients (Epstein´s vs 24% Wolters´ criteria). Rate of patients with adverse pathological features was 36%.

Methods:   The prospective study included patients who were planned for fusion prostate biopsy and had PSA < 10 ng/mL and a PI-RADS ≥ 3. All the patients underwent 12-core standard transrectal prostate biopsy followed targeted biopsy (combined biopsy). Based on preoperative complete blood count parameters, SII was calculated using the following formula: SII = platelet × neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. Correlations between PI-RADS score, platelet, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, PSA, PSA density, SII and PCa were determined using ROC curve analysis. Optimal cut-off values were determined using the maximum Youden Index (defined as: sensitivity + specificity - 1).  Results:   The study included 508 patients with a mean age of 62.49 ± 6.86 years and a median PSA level of 7.28 (5.69-8.70) ng/mL. The overall clinically significant PCa rate was 39.4%. Although SII had no significant diagnostic value in PCa patients with low ISUP grades (grade 1 and 2) (AUC = 0.487, P = 0.622), it was revealed as a significant marker in PCa patients with an ISUP grade ≥ 3 (AUC = 0.811, P < 0.001). The cut-off value of SII was 533.0. While the combination of SII with PI-RADS score is the most effective marker, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet were also revealed as effective markers in predicting ISUP grade 3-5 PCa, though not as effective as SII.  Conclusion:   SII and SII combination with PI-RADS score appear to be a significant diagnostic marker in patients with high-grade PCa (ISUP grade 3-5).

The time window between cancer diagnosis and surgery causes high levels of uncertainty and stress, which negatively impact quality of life (QoL). We previously reported a larger intervention pilot study which demonstrated that participation in a community-based pre-operative exercise programme significantly improved physical fitness and health-related quality of life in men with prostate cancer prior to surgery. The aim of the current pilot study was to get an insight into men's perceptions of wellbeing and QoL following completion of the pre-operative exercise programme.  Methods:   From November 2017 to June 2018, men scheduled for prostate cancer surgery were recruited and took part in a prescribed community-based pre-operative exercise programme in the time available between referral and surgery. Following completion of the pre-operative exercise programme (within 1 week before surgery), participants took part in one semi-structured interview which explored four broad QoL domains: physical, psychological, social, and spiritual wellbeing. Data were analysed using thematic analysis (a bottom up/inductive analysis).  Results:   Eleven men were recruited: mean standard deviation (SD) age was 60 ± 7 years. Data supported four main themes. Participation in the community-based pre-operative exercise training programme (over a mean (SD) of 4 ± 2 weeks) provided participants with: 1) a teachable moment; 2) a journey of preparation; 3) a sense of optimism; and 4) social connectedness prior to surgery.  Conclusion:   This study provides an insight into how the exercise programme impacted wellbeing and QoL in men preparing for prostate cancer surgery. These findings highlight the important role that exercise prehabilitation plays for men preparing for prostate cancer surgery. Such exercise programmes can be easily implemented into standard cancer pathways by establishing relationships between hospital teams and community exercise programmes.""","""['Lisa Loughney', 'Rachel McGowan', ""Kiaran O'Malley"", 'Noel McCaffrey', 'Bróna Furlong', 'Deirdre Walsh']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['The effect of a pre- and post-operative exercise programme versus standard care on physical fitness of patients with oesophageal and gastric cancer undergoing neoadjuvant treatment prior to surgery (The PERIOP-OG Trial): Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.', 'Creating a teachable moment in community pharmacy for men with prostate cancer: A qualitative study of lifestyle changes.', 'The Wessex Fit-4-Cancer Surgery Trial (WesFit): a protocol for a factorial-design, pragmatic randomised-controlled trial investigating the effects of a multi-modal prehabilitation programme in patients undergoing elective major intra-cavity cancer surgery.', 'Psychosocial interventions for men with prostate cancer: a Cochrane systematic review.', 'Psychosocial interventions for men with prostate cancer.', 'Barriers, facilitators, perceptions and preferences influencing physical activity participation, and the similarities and differences between cancer types and treatment stages - A systematic rapid review.']"""

The CLQ Discovery (CLQD) database was created to make data available for research and this paper provides a summary of this database.  Methods:   This study described the clinical and demographic characteristics of the 12 most common cancers in the CLQD database. We included patients with a new malignant tumor diagnosis between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2018, of the following cancers: breast, lung and bronchus, prostate, colon and rectum, melanoma of the skin, bladder, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, kidney and renal pelvis, uterus, leukemia, pancreas, and thyroid. Patients with an in-situ diagnosis were excluded. Summary statistics and Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were calculated for each tumor.  Results:   From 2013 to 2018, 491,360 patients were diagnosed with the study tumors. Breast cancer (139,506) was the most common, followed by lung and bronchus (70,959), prostate (63,303), and colon and rectum (53,504). The median age at diagnosis (years) was 61, 68, 68, and 64 in breast, lung and bronchus, prostate, and colon and rectum cohorts, respectively. Compared to the SEER 5-year overall survival estimates for several tumor types were higher in the CLQD database, possibly because of incomplete mortality capture in electronic health records.  Conclusion:   This paper presents the first description of the CLQD database since its inception. CLQ will continue to evolve over time, and the breadth and depth of this data asset will continue to grow. ASCO and CLQ's long-term goal is to improve the quality of patient care and create a sustainable database for oncology researchers. These results demonstrate that CLQ built a scalable database that can be used for oncology research.""","""['Danielle M Potter', 'Mark F Riffon', 'Brittany Manning', 'Aliki Taylor', 'Cathy Emmas', 'Shaum Kabadi', 'Miao Jiang', 'Robert S Miller']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""JCO Clin Cancer Inform""","""['Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Long-Term Survival and Causes of Death After Diagnoses of Common Cancers in 3 Cohorts of US Health Professionals.', 'Italian cancer figures, report 2013: Multiple tumours.', 'Volume and health outcomes: evidence from systematic reviews and from evaluation of Italian hospital data.', 'Using cancer case identification algorithms in medico-administrative databases: Literature review and first results from the REDSIAM Tumors group based on breast, colon, and lung cancer.', 'Real-world clinical outcomes of patients with BRCA-mutated, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative metastatic breast cancer: a CancerLinQ® study.', 'A Bivalent Activatable Fluorescent Probe for Screening and Intravital Imaging of Chemotherapy-Induced Cancer Cell Death.']"""

Photochemical release of 4 or 6 from 7-11 was demonstrated, and the spectrophotometric evaluation of 7 showed that it behaves similarly to free 4 (type II heme ligation) after irradiation with visible light but not in the dark. Unexpectedly, the intact Ru(II) complexes 7 and 8 were found to inhibit CYP3A4 potently and specifically through direct binding to the active site without heme ligation. Caged inhibitors 9-11 showed dual action properties by combining photoactivated dissociation of 4 or 6 with efficient 1O2 production. In prostate adenocarcinoma DU-145 cells, compound 9 had the best synergistic effect with vinblastine, the anticancer drug primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 in vivo.

Here, we devised an LC/MS-based approach allowing parallel, robust global-proteomics and targeted-metabolomics quantification from the same LCM samples, using biopsies from prostate cancer (PCa) patients as the model system. The strategy features: (i) an optimized molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) filter-based separation of proteins and small-molecule fractions with high and consistent recoveries; (ii) microscale derivatization and charge-based enrichment for ultrasensitive quantification of key androgens (LOQ = 5 fg/1k cells) with excellent accuracy/precision; (iii) reproducible/precise proteomics quantification with low-missing-data using a detergent-cocktail-based sample preparation and an IonStar pipeline for reproducible and precise protein quantification with excellent data quality. Key parameters enabling robust/reproducible quantification have been meticulously evaluated and optimized, and the results underscored the importance of surveying quantitative performances against key parameters to facilitate fit-for-purpose method development. As a proof-of-concept, high-quality quantification of the proteome and androgens in LCM samples of PCa patient-matched cancerous and benign epithelial/stromal cells was achieved (N = 16), which suggested distinct androgen distribution patterns across cell types and regions, as well as the dysregulated pathways involved in tumor-stroma crosstalk in PCa pathology. This strategy markedly leverages the scope of quantitative-omics investigations using LCM samples, and combining with IonStar, can be readily adapted to larger-cohort clinical analysis. Moreover, the capacity of parallel proteomics/metabolomics quantification permits precise corroboration of regulatory processes on both protein and small-molecule levels, with decreased batch effect and enhanced utilization of samples.""","""['Shichen Shen', 'Jun Li', 'Shihan Huo', 'Min Ma', 'Xiaoyu Zhu', 'Sailee Rasam', 'Xiaotao Duan', 'Miao Qu', 'Mark A Titus', 'Jun Qu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['High-quality and robust protein quantification in large clinical/pharmaceutical cohorts with IonStar proteomics investigation.', 'Ultra-High-Resolution IonStar Strategy Enhancing Accuracy and Precision of MS1-Based Proteomics and an Extensive Comparison with State-of-the-Art SWATH-MS in Large-Cohort Quantification.', 'An IonStar Experimental Strategy for MS1 Ion Current-Based Quantification Using Ultrahigh-Field Orbitrap: Reproducible, In-Depth, and Accurate Protein Measurement in Large Cohorts.', 'Proteomic profiling of human islets collected from frozen pancreata using laser capture microdissection.', 'Translational Metabolomics of Head Injury: Exploring Dysfunctional Cerebral Metabolism with Ex Vivo NMR Spectroscopy-Based Metabolite Quantification.', 'Advancements in Oncoproteomics Technologies: Treading toward Translation into Clinical Practice.', 'In-depth mapping of protein localizations in whole tissue by micro-scaffold assisted spatial proteomics (MASP).', 'High-quality and robust protein quantification in large clinical/pharmaceutical cohorts with IonStar proteomics investigation.', 'The Integration of Metabolomics with Other Omics: Insights into Understanding Prostate Cancer.', 'Metabolomic Biomarkers in Blood Samples Identify Cancers in a Mixed Population of Patients with Nonspecific Symptoms.']"""

Patients and methods:   The medical records of 59 consecutive patients who had previously received docetaxel chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and who received cabazitaxel at our hospital between January 2011 and March 2020 were retrospectively reviewed and statistically analyzed.  Results:   The median follow-up period after cabazitaxel initiation was 15.2 months. The 30% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate, median PSA progression-free survival period, and overall survival (OS) period were 45.8%, 4.3 months, and 22.6 months, respectively. Within 1 to 2 cycles of cabazitaxel, we were unable to identify hematological or serum kinetics that had a relationship with OS. Analysis of the variables after 3 cycles of cabazitaxel, however, revealed two factors, PSA decline > 30% (p = 0.016) and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) decline > 30% (p = 0.044), as the predictors of favorable outcome for OS. We established a prognostic model for predicting the OS period composed of these two factors, which exhibited distinctly separated OS curves (p = 0.004).

Dynamic PET-CT was performed to investigate the tumour detection and differences in temporal distribution, as well as in kinetic modelling of [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 by tissue type.  Methods:   Dynamic PET-CT over the lower abdomen and static whole-body PET-CT 80-90 min p.i. from 142 patients with biochemical recurrence were retrospectively analysed. Detection rates were compared to PSA levels. Average time-activity curves were calculated from tumour lesions and normal tissue. A three-compartment model and non-compartment model were used to calculate tumour kinetics.  Results:   Overall detection rate was 70.42%, and in patients with PSA > 0.4 ng/mL 76.67%. All tumour lesions presented the steepest standardised uptake value (SUV) incline in the first 7-8 min before decreasing to different degrees. Normal tissue presented with a low uptake, except for the bladder, which accumulated activity the steepest 15-16 min. p.i.. While all tumour lesions continuously increased, bone metastases showed the steepest decline, resulting in a significantly lower SUV than lymph node metastases (60 and 80-90 min). Transport rate from the blood and tracer binding and internalisation rate were lower in bone metastases. Heterogeneity (fractal dimension) and vascular density were significantly lower in bone metastases.  Conclusion:   Even at low PSA between 0.51 and 0.99 ng/mL, detection rate was 57%. Dynamic imaging showed a time window in the first 10 min where tumour uptake is high, but no bladder activity is measured, aiding accuracy in distinction of local recurrence.

However, previous analyses did not take into account potential differences in sampling strategies (number of biopsy cores), which might have confounded these reports.  Material and methods:   Within our single-institutional database we identified PCa patients treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) between 2000 and 2020 (n = 21,646). We calculated the estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) for D'Amico risk groups, biopsy Gleason Grade Group (GGG), PSA and cT stage as well as postoperative RP GGG and pT stage relying on log linear regression methodology. Subsequently, we repeated the analyses after adjustment for number of cores obtained at biopsy.  Results:   Absolute rates of D'Amico low risk decreased (-30.1%), while intermediate and high risk increased (+21.2% and +9.0%, respectively). Rates of GGG I decreased (-50.0%), while GGG II-V increased, with the largest increase in GGG II (+22.5%). This trend, albeit less pronounced, was also recorded after adjusted EAPC analyses (p < .05). Specifically, EAPC values for D'Amico low vs intermediate vs high risk were -1.07%, +0.37%, +0.45%, respectively, and EAPC values for GGG ranged between -0.71% (GGG I) and +0.80% (GGG IV). Finally, an increase in ≥cT2 (EAPC: +3.16%) was displayed (all p < .001). These trends were confirmed in EAPC calculations in RP GGG and pT stages (p < .001).

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed data from 726 patients who underwent RP without any neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment between 2010 and 2014. We statistically assessed the impact of NS sides on PSM location and BCR.  Results:   PSM rates were 21.9% in the 726 patients studied, 13.2% in patients with ≤pT2, and 46.8% in patients with ≥pT3. Regarding PSM locations, the anterior-apex (AA) was the most common site for PSM (43.3%). After adjusting for confounding factors, bilateral nerve sparing (BNS) had a significantly higher odds ratio of PSM than the absence of NS did (odds ratio [OR] 3.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.85-4.99). In the UNS RP in patients with ≤pT2, non-AA PSM on the non-NS side was significantly higher than that on the NS side (92.9% vs. 45.5%, p = 0.009). In all patients, 5.8% experienced BCR during a median follow-up of 43.5 months. PSM was significantly associated with BCR-free survival in patients with ≤pT2 (p = 0.013), but not in patients with ≥pT3 (p = 0.185). Non-AA PSM at the non-NS side was an independent risk factor for BCR (hazard ratio [HR] 2.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-5.85), whereas AA PSMs, including NS/non-NS sides and non-AA PSM at the NS side, were not associated with BCR-free survival.

This study investigated the role of IL-6 in biological sequelae following irradiation and highlighted the effects of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) on the radiation response of PCa and its relationship with IL-6 signaling. Human and murine PCa cell lines were used to examine the response to irradiation in vitro and in vivo. The relationship of IL-6 expression with clinicopathologic characteristics in 104 PCa patients treated with definite RT was also examined. We also investigated the changes in radiation response after calcitriol supplementation and the relationship between calcitriol and IL-6 signaling by conducting cellular and animal experiments. Based on clinical samples, the positivity of IL-6 staining is a significant predictor of biochemical failure-free survival for PCa patients treated with definite RT. Data from preclinical models showed that inhibition of IL-6 increased the response of PCa to radiation, which was associated with increased oxidative DNA damage, attenuated EMT and MDSC recruitment, and decreased tumor regrowth. Moreover, increased vitamin D3 levels by calcitriol supplementation or induction by UVB-radiation was associated with inhibited IL-6 signaling and increased the response to irradiation observed in animal models. These data demonstrate that IL-6 play a critical role in the radiation response of PCa, which involved tumor cell killing and altering the tumor microenvironment. Directly targeting IL-6 signaling or vitamin D3 supplement with oral or light treatment could be a promising strategy to increase the response of PCa to radiation.""","""['Chun-Te Wu', 'Yun-Ching Huang', 'Wen-Cheng Chen', 'Miao-Fen Chen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""['Role of vitamin D3 in tumor aggressiveness and radiation response for hepatocellular carcinoma.', '1α,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 Inhibits Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Progression by Reducing IL6 Signaling.', 'The role of IL-6 in the radiation response of prostate cancer.', '1alpha(OH)D3 One-alpha-hydroxy-cholecalciferol--an active vitamin D analog.

Both local treatments and systemic androgen deprivation therapy may contribute to these outcomes and are differentially indicated based on disease characteristics. We sought to compare sexual function through 5 years after radiation treatment with and without androgen deprivation therapy in men with good baseline sexual function to better understand long-term effects in this understudied subset of patients.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed a prospectively assembled population-based cohort of men who underwent radiation with and without androgen deprivation therapy for intermediate or high-risk localized prostate cancer. Sexual function was assessed longitudinally over 5 years. Men with erections sufficient for intercourse at baseline were selected for inclusion.  Results:   Out of 167 patients included, 73 underwent radiation alone and 94 received androgen deprivation therapy plus radiation (51 with intermediate and 43 with high-risk disease). Androgen deprivation therapy use was associated with worse sexual function through 1 year regardless of disease risk. This difference was no longer statistically significant at 3 years in the intermediate-risk group. Compared to radiation alone, androgen deprivation therapy in high-risk disease was associated with worse sexual function at 3 years (effect: -20.3 points, CI [-31.8, -8.8], p < 0.001) but not at 5 years (effect: -3.4, CI [-17.2, 10.5], p = 0.63).  Conclusions:   Androgen deprivation therapy plus radiation is associated with worse sexual function through 3-years follow-up in men with high-risk prostate cancer compared to radiation alone.

Methods:   We used the SEER-Medicare database to identify men ages 66+ diagnosed with a low-risk PCa (PSA < 10 ng/mL, Gleason ≤ 6, stage ≤ T2a) in 2010-2013 with ≥1 year of follow-up. We used claims data to capture (1) PCa treatments, including surgical procedures, radiotherapy, and hormone therapy, and (2) AS monitoring procedures, including PSA tests and prostate biopsy. We defined EM as receiving no AT within 1 year of diagnosis. We used multivariable regression techniques to identify factors associated with EM, initiating AS monitoring, and switching to AT.  Results:   During the study period, EM increased from 29.4% to 49.0%, p < 0.01. Age < 77, being married/partnered, non-Hispanic ethnicity, higher median ZIP code income, lower PSA levels, stage T1c, and more recent year of diagnosis were associated with EM.

By three years after diagnosis, 21.3% of the EM cohort had switched to AT, usually after undergoing AS monitoring procedures.  Discussion:   We found increasing uptake of EM over time, though over 50% still received AT. About 60% of EM patients did not initiate AS monitoring, even among those with life expectancy >10 years, implying that a substantial proportion was being managed by watchful waiting.

Moreover, this increased incidence of prostate cancer is accompanied by rapid disease progression and poor clinical outcomes.  Methods and results:   We show that androgen-receptor activation, a key driver of prostate carcinogenesis, can disrupt the MSH2 gene in prostate cancer. We screened tumours from two cohorts (recurrent/non-recurrent) of prostate cancer patients to confirm the loss of MSH2 protein expression and identified decreased MSH2 expression in recurrent cases. Stratifying the independent TCGA prostate cancer cohort for MSH2/6 expression revealed that patients with lower levels of MSH2/6 had significant worse outcomes, in contrast, endometrial and colorectal cancer patients with lower MSH2/6 levels. MMRd endometrial and colorectal tumours showed the expected increase in mutational burden, microsatellite instability and enhanced immune cell mobilisation but this was not evident in prostate tumours.

Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanism underlying metastasis is imperative if we are to develop novel therapeutic strategies. Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL) regulates bone remodelling. Thus, agents that suppress RANKL signalling may be useful pharmacological treatments. Here, we used preclinical experimental models to investigate whether an inactive form of RANKL affects bone metastasis in RANKL-induced PCa. RANKL was associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and expression of metastasis-related genes in PC3 cells. Therefore, we proposed a strategy to induce anti-cytokine antibodies using mutant RANKL as an immunogen. RANKL promoted migration and invasion of PC3 cells through EMT, and induced a significant increase in binding of β-catenin to TCF-4, an EMT-induced transcription factor in PCa cells, via mitogen-activated protein kinase and β-catenin/TCF-4 signalling. Thus, RANKL increased EMT and the metastatic properties of PC3 cells, suggesting a role as a therapeutic target to prevent PCa metastasis. Treatment with mutant RANKL reduced EMT and metastasis of PC3 PCa cells in an experimental metastasis model. Thus, mutant RANKL could serve as a potential vaccine to prevent and treat metastatic PCa.""","""['Mineon Park#', 'Yong Jin Cho#', 'Bora Kim', 'Young Jong Ko', 'Yuria Jang', 'Yeon Hee Moon', 'Hoon Hyun', 'Wonbong Lim']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Targeting IL-6 and RANKL signaling inhibits prostate cancer growth in bone.', 'RANKL acts directly on RANK-expressing prostate tumor cells and mediates migration and expression of tumor metastasis genes.', 'Oncogenic miR-210-3p promotes prostate cancer cell EMT and bone metastasis via NF-κB signaling pathway.', 'Targeting RANKL in breast cancer: bone metastasis and beyond.', 'Multifunctional properties of RANKL/RANK in cell differentiation, proliferation and metastasis.', 'Intercellular Communication Reveals Therapeutic Potential of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.', 'Identification and validation of a hypoxia-immune signature for overall survival prediction in lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Interaction between prostate cancer stem cells and bone microenvironment regulates prostate cancer bone metastasis and treatment resistance.', 'Receptor Activator of NF-κB (RANK) Confers Resistance to Chemotherapy in AML and Associates with Dismal Disease Course.']"""

We aimed to investigate the association between body weight variability (BWV) and all cancer and site-specific cancer incidence and the impact of smoking on these associations. A total of 1,759,848 cancer-free male subjects who had their weight measured at least 5 times from the National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening Cohort from 2002 to 2011 were included and followed up until 2015. BWV was defined as the average absolute difference between successive values (ASV). The risk of cancer and site-specific cancer from BWV was identified using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis using hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for potential confounders including weight, and stratified analysis was also conducted according to smoking status. During the 7,015,413 person-years of follow-up, 11,494 patients (0.65%) developed new-onset cancers. BWV was associated with a higher risk of all cancers after adjustment for confounders. The highest BWV quintile group compared to the lowest had greater risks of all cancers and site-specific cancers including lung, liver, and prostate cancer (HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.15-1.30; HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.07-1.39; HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.19-1.81; HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.15-1.62, in all cancers, lung, liver and prostate cancer, respectively). Due to small number of cancer occurrence, the risk of kidney cancer was increased, but statistically insignificant (HR 1.38, 95% CI 0.91-2.10). Similar results were observed in noncurrent smokers. However, in current smokers, the risks of all cancers and only prostate cancer were significantly increased in the highest BWV quintile group (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.09-1.31; HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.08-2.11). The risk of kidney cancer also increased in this group, although the finding was not statistically significant (HR 1.77, 95% CI 0.87-3.63) This study suggested BWV is an independent risk factor for cancer in men, especially in lung, liver, and prostate cancer, but evidence was weaker in kidney cancer.

Patients and methods:   This phase Ib study evaluated atezolizumab + radium-223 in men with mCRPC and bone and lymph node and/or visceral metastases that progressed after androgen pathway inhibitor treatment. Following safety assessment of concurrent dosing, 45 men were randomized 1:1:1 to concurrent or one of two staggered dosing schedules with either agent introduced one cycle before the other. This was followed by a safety-efficacy expansion cohort (randomized 1:1:1). The primary endpoints were safety and objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints included radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), PSA responses, and overall survival (OS).  Results:   As of October 4, 2019, 44 of 45 men were evaluable. All 44 had ≥1 all-cause adverse event (AE); 23 (52.3%) had a grade 3/4 AE. Fifteen (34.1%) grade 3/4 and 3 (6.8%) grade 5 AEs were related to atezolizumab; none were related to radium-223.

We examined five of the top 40 CpG sites in a case-control study nested in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) Cohort.  Methods:   We investigated the associations between prediagnostic WBC DNA methylation in 297 breast cancer cases and 297 frequency-matched controls. Two WBC DNA specimens from each participant were used: a proximate sample collected 1 to 2.9 years and a distant sample collected 4.2-7.3 years prior to diagnosis in cases or the comparable timepoints in controls. WBC DNA methylation level was measured using targeted bisulfite amplification sequencing. We used logistic regression to obtain ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI).  Results:   A one-unit increase in percent methylation in ERCC1 in proximate WBC DNA was associated with increased breast cancer risk (adjusted OR = 1.29; 95% CI, 1.06-1.57).

This leads to a higher proline content that exacerbates the effects of the so-called proline-P5C cycle, with tumour cells effectively using this method to increase cell survival. If a method of reducing or inhibiting P5C reductase could be discovered, it would provide new means of treating cancer. To address this point, the effect of some phenyl-substituted derivatives of aminomethylene-bisphosphonic acid, previously found to interfere with the catalytic activity of plant and bacterial P5C reductases, was evaluated in vitro on the human isoform 1 (PYCR1), expressed in E. coli and affinity purified. The 3.5-dibromophenyl- and 3.5-dichlorophenyl-derivatives showed a remarkable effectiveness, with IC50 values lower than 1 µM and a mechanism of competitive type against both P5C and NADPH. The actual occurrence in vivo of enzyme inhibition was assessed on myelogenous erythroleukemic K562 and epithelial breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell lines, whose growth was progressively impaired by concentrations of the dibromo derivative ranging from 10-6 to 10-4 M. Interestingly, growth inhibition was not relieved by the exogenous supply of proline, suggesting that the effect relies on the interference with the proline-P5C cycle, and not on proline starvation.""","""['Giuseppe Forlani', 'Giuseppe Sabbioni', 'Daniele Ragno', 'Davide Petrollino', 'Monica Borgatti']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem""","""['Synthesis and evaluation of effective inhibitors of plant δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase.', 'Tailoring the structure of aminobisphosphonates to target plant P5C reductase.', 'Phytotoxicity of aminobisphosphonates targeting both δ1 -pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase and glutamine synthetase.', 'PYCR, a key enzyme in proline metabolism, functions in tumorigenesis.', 'Isozymes of P5C reductase (PYCR) in human diseases: focus on cancer.', 'Functional Impact of a Cancer-Related Variant in Human Δ1-Pyrroline-5-Carboxylate Reductase 1.', 'Expression and kinetic characterization of PYCR3.', 'Proline metabolism reprogramming of trained macrophages induced by early respiratory infection combined with allergen sensitization contributes to development of allergic asthma in childhood of mice.', 'Dual contribution of the mTOR pathway and of the metabolism of amino acids in prostate cancer.', 'Deciphering the structure of Arabidopsis thaliana 5-enol-pyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate synthase: An essential step toward the discovery of novel inhibitors to supersede glyphosate.']"""

When placed in physiological fluids, they inevitably encounter biomolecules (majorly proteins) and form complexes that largely affect their biological fate. Nevertheless, little is known regarding the quantitative profile of proteins that adsorb to DNA aptamers and DNA nanostructures in biological environments, and there are no potent strategies to regulate protein profiles. Herein, we performed a proteomic analysis to profile proteins that bind to DNA aptamers (Sgc8c and SYLC3) and nanostructures (a tetrahedral DNA nanostructure and a DNA origami rod) in human serum using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Dozens to hundreds of proteins were identified with each DNA material exhibiting highly distinctive profiles. It was also revealed that the origin of serum (from healthy donor vs from prostate cancer patients) causes significant differences in profiles of bound proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the protein profile may be regulated by tethering a layer of single-stranded DNA (polythymine) onto the DNA origami rod to alleviate the adsorption of complement-associated proteins, which significantly reduced its sequestration by macrophages. Taken together, this study has provided qualitative and quantitative proteomic profiles regarding serum proteins that adsorb to various DNA materials and have demonstrated that the composition of interacted proteins may be regulated toward better biological performances.""","""['Fan Xu', 'Baijun Dong', 'Xue Li', 'Fei Gao', 'Donglei Yang', 'Wei Xue', 'Pengfei Wang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['Aptamer-Functionalized DNA Nanostructures for Biological Applications.', 'Aptamer-integrated DNA nanostructures for biosensing, bioimaging and cancer therapy.', 'FRET-Mediated Observation of Protein-Triggered Conformational Changes in DNA Nanostructures.', 'Beyond the Fold: Emerging Biological Applications of DNA Origami.', 'Gene-therapy Inspired Polycation Coating for Protection of DNA Origami Nanostructures.', 'Functionalizing DNA origami to investigate and interact with biological systems.', 'Nucleic acid nanostructures for in vivo applications: The influence of morphology on biological fate.', 'Controlling Nuclease Degradation of Wireframe DNA Origami with Minor Groove Binders.']"""

While the potential of IATP in automating RT treatment planning has been demonstrated, its poor scalability caused by an almost linear growth of network size with the number of treatment planning parameters (TPPs) is a bottleneck, preventing its application in complicate, but clinically relevant treatment planning problems. The decision-making behavior of the trained network is hard to understand. Motivated by the decision-making process of a human planner, this study proposes a hierarchical IATP framework.Methods and materials.The hierarchical VTPN (HieVTPN) consists of three networks, i.e. Structure-Net, Parameter-Net, and Action-Net. When interacting with a TPS, the networks are employed in a sequential order in each step to decide the structure to adjust, the TPP to adjust for the selected structure, and the specific adjustment manner for the parameter, respectively. We developed an end-to-end hierarchical deep reinforcement learning scheme to simultaneously train the three networks. We then evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed framework in the treatment planning problems for prostate cancer intensity modulated RT (IMRT) and stereotactic body RT (SBRT). We benchmarked the performance of our approach by comparing plans made by VTPN of a parallel architecture, and the human plans submitted for competition in the 2016 American Association of Medical Dosimetrist (AAMD)/Radiosurgery Society (RSS) Plan Study. We analyzed scalability of the network size with respect to the number of TPPs. Numerical experiments were also performed to understand the rationale of the decision-making behaviors of the trained HieVTPN.Results.Both HieVTPNs for prostate IMRT and SBRT were trained successfully using 10 training patient cases and 5 validation cases. For IMRT, HieVTPN was able to generate high-quality plans for 59 testing patient cases that were not included in training process, achieving an average plan score of 8.62 (±0.83), with 9 being the maximal score. The score was comparable to that of the VTPN, 8.45 (±0.48). For SBRT planning, HieVTPN achieved an average plan score of 139.07 on five testing patient cases compared to the score of 132.21 averaged over the human plans summited for competition in AAMD/RSS plan study. Different from VTPN with network size linearly scaling with the number of TPPs, the network size of HieVTPN is almost independent of the number of TPPs. It was also observed that the decision-making behaviors of HieVTPN were understandable and generally agreed with the human experience.Conclusions.With the scalability and explainability, the hierarchical IATP framework is more favorable than the previous framework in terms of handling treatment planning problems involving a large number of TPPs.""","""['Chenyang Shen', 'Liyuan Chen', 'Xun Jia']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['The development of a deep reinforcement learning network for dose-volume-constrained treatment planning in prostate cancer intensity modulated radiotherapy.', 'Improving efficiency of training a virtual treatment planner network via knowledge-guided deep reinforcement learning for intelligent automatic treatment planning of radiotherapy.', 'Operating a treatment planning system using a deep-reinforcement learning-based virtual treatment planner for prostate cancer intensity-modulated radiation therapy treatment planning.', 'Advances in Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Knowledge-based planning for intensity-modulated radiation therapy: A review of data-driven approaches.', 'An integrated solution of deep reinforcement learning for automatic IMRT treatment planning in non-small-cell lung cancer.', ""Modeling physician's preference in treatment plan approval of stereotactic body radiation therapy of prostate cancer."", 'The development of a deep reinforcement learning network for dose-volume-constrained treatment planning in prostate cancer intensity modulated radiotherapy.']"""

The long noncoding RNA SCHLAP1 has been suggested, but its prognostic value has not been investigated in the context of tumor heterogeneity. In the present study, expression of SCHLAP1 was investigated using real-time RT-PCR in a multisampled series of 778 tissue samples from radical prostatectomies of 164 prostate cancer patients (median follow-up time 7.4 y). The prognostic value of SCHLAP1 was evaluated with biochemical recurrence as endpoint. In total, 29% of patients were classified as having high expression of SCHLAP1 in at least one malignant sample. Among these, inter- and intrafocal heterogeneity was detected in 72% and 56%, respectively. High expression of SCHLAP1 was shown to be a predictor of biochemical recurrence in both uni- and multivariable cox regression analyses (P < 0.001 and P = 0.02). High expression of SCHLAP1 was also significantly associated with adverse clinicopathological characteristics, including grade group, high pT stage, invasive cribriform growth/intraductal carcinoma of the prostate, and reactive stroma. In conclusion, high expression of SCHLAP1 in at least one malignant sample is a robust prognostic biomarker in primary prostate cancer. For the first time, high SCHLAP1 expression has been associated with the aggressive histopathologic feature reactive stroma. The expression of SCHLAP1 is highly heterogeneous, and analysis of multiple samples is therefore crucial in determination of the SCHLAP1 status of a patient.""","""['Susanne G Kidd', 'Kristina T Carm', 'Mari Bogaard', 'Linn Guro Olsen', 'Anne Cathrine Bakken', 'Marthe Løvf', 'Ragnhild A Lothe', 'Karol Axcrona', 'Ulrika Axcrona', 'Rolf I Skotheim']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['RNA biomarkers associated with metastatic progression in prostate cancer: a multi-institutional high-throughput analysis of SChLAP1.', 'Overexpression of the Long Non-coding RNA SChLAP1 Independently Predicts Lethal Prostate Cancer.', 'A Prostate Cancer ""Nimbosus"": Genomic Instability and SChLAP1 Dysregulation Underpin Aggression of Intraductal and Cribriform Subpathologies.', 'Clinical prospects of long noncoding RNAs as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets in prostate cancer.', 'Current Insights into Long Non-Coding RNAs (LncRNAs) in Prostate Cancer.', 'Long non-coding RNA ENST00000503625 is a potential prognostic biomarker and metastasis suppressor gene in prostate cancer.', 'Underlying Features of Prostate Cancer-Statistics, Risk Factors, and Emerging Methods for Its Diagnosis.', 'Single cell analysis of cribriform prostate cancer reveals cell intrinsic and tumor microenvironmental pathways of aggressive disease.', 'Somatic mutations reveal complex metastatic seeding from multifocal primary prostate cancer.', 'Long non-coding RNA in prostate cancer.']"""

To facilitate the translation of candidates into clinically applicable tests, robust and accurate targeted parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) assays that can be widely adopted in multiple labs were developed in this study. The developed PRM assays for the urinary glycopeptides, FLN*ESYK from ACPP and EDALN*ETR from CLU, demonstrated good repeatability and a sufficient working range covering three to four orders of magnitude, and their performance in differentiating aggressive PCa was assessed by the quantitative analysis of urine specimens collected from 69 nonaggressive (Gleason score = 6) and 73 aggressive (Gleason ≥ 8) PCa patients. When ACPP combined with CLU, the discrimination power was improved from an area under a curve (AUC) of 0.66 to 0.78. By combining ACPP, CLU, and serum PSA to form a three-signature panel, the AUC was further improved to 0.83 (sensitivity: 84.9%, specificity: 66.7%). Since the serum PSA test alone had an AUC of 0.68, our results demonstrated that the new urinary glycopeptide PRM assays can serve as an adjunct to the serum PSA test to achieve better predictive power toward aggressive PCa. In summary, our developed PRM assays for urinary glycopeptides were successfully applied to clinical PCa urine samples with a promising performance in aggressive PCa detection.""","""['Mingming Dong', 'Tung-Shing Mamie Lih', 'Naseruddin Höti', 'Shao-Yung Chen', 'Sean Ponce', 'Alan Partin', 'Hui Zhang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Proteome Res""","""['Differentially expressed glycoproteins in pre- and post-digital rectal examination urine samples for detecting aggressive prostate cancer.', 'Urinary marker panels for aggressive prostate cancer detection.', 'Urinary glycoproteins associated with aggressive prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-specific antigen and other serum and urine markers in prostate cancer.', 'Current biomarkers for diagnosing of prostate cancer.', 'Urinary PSA and Serum PSA for Aggressive Prostate Cancer Detection.', 'Differentially expressed glycoproteins in pre- and post-digital rectal examination urine samples for detecting aggressive prostate cancer.', 'Urinary marker panels for aggressive prostate cancer detection.', 'An N-glycoproteomic site-mapping analysis reveals glycoprotein alterations in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Transcriptome profiling and proteomic validation reveals targets of the androgen receptor signaling in the BT-474 breast cancer cell line.']"""

Three modalities of radioguided surgery, the sentinel node procedure, Cerenkov Luminescence / beta-radio-guided surgery and radio-guided salvage surgery in recurrent prostate cancer, were reviewed in detail. Radioguided surgery for prostate cancer has shown promising value in the treatment of primary diagnosed prostate cancer and recurrent loco-regional lymph node positive prostate cancer. Advances have been made into minimal invasive (robot-assisted) laparoscopic surgery. The sentinel node procedure for prostate cancer has been further developed and is currently performed with high diagnostic sensitivity. Cerenkov luminescence imaging is a feasible and encouraging technique for intraoperative margin assessment in prostate cancer. Radioguided surgery in recurrent prostate cancer has shown to be feasible, yielding high sensitivity and specificity for detecting small local recurrences and metastases. With the availability of different new tracers, the road has been paved towards clinically feasible radioguided surgery for prostate cancer.

Human studies have been conflicting. Men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer experience profound hypogonadism resulting in increased insulin resistance. In a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of zoledronic acid versus placebo in men commencing extended-duration ADT, we aimed to examine the effects on fat mass and glucose metabolism. We hypothesised that zoledronic acid, which reduces osteocalcin concentrations, would worsen ADT-induced insulin resistance.  Methods:   This was a prespecified secondary analysis of an RCT designed to evaluate the effects of zoledronic acid on bone microarchitecture in 76 men with non-metastatic prostate cancer undergoing curative radiotherapy combined with adjuvant ADT (n = 39 randomised to a single dose of zoledronic acid 5 mg, n = 37 randomised to matching placebo). Oral glucose tolerance tests to determine Matsuda Index were performed at 0, 3, 12 and 24 months. Using a mixed model, mean adjusted differences [MAD (95% confidence interval)] between the groups over time are reported.  Results:   Over 24 months of ADT, fat mass increased and lean mass decreased for both groups, with no significant between group difference [MAD 401 g (-1307; 2103), p = 0.23 and -184 g (-1325; 955), p = 0.36 respectively]. Bone remodelling markers C-telopeptide [MAD -176 ng/l (-275; -76), p < 0.001 and P1NP -18 mg/l (-32; -5), p < 0.001] as a surrogate for osteocalcin, remained significantly lower in the zoledronic acid group, compared with placebo. There was no mean adjusted between-group difference for homeostatic model assessment 2 insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR) [-0.2 (-0.6; 0.2), p = 0.45], HbA1c [-0.1% (-0.3; 0.1), p = 0.64] or Matsuda Index [0.8 (-1.1; 2.7), p = 0.38]. The Matsuda Index decreased in both groups consistent with worsening insulin resistance with ADT.  Conclusion:   A single dose of zoledronic acid does not appear to influence glucose metabolism in men newly commencing ADT.

Nanoparticle-mediated photoporation using carbon black nanoparticles exposed to pulsed, near-infrared laser irradiation offers a physical route to create transient cell membrane pores, enabling intracellular delivery. However, nanoparticle-mediated photoporation, like other physical intracellular delivery technologies, necessitates a trade-off between achieving efficient uptake of exogenous molecules and maintaining high cell viability.  Methods:   In this study, we sought to shift this balance by adding serum to cells during nanoparticle-mediated photoporation as a viability protectant. DU-145 prostate cancer cells and human dermal fibroblasts were exposed to laser irradiation in the presence of carbon black (CB) nanoparticles and other formulation additives, including fetal bovine serum (FBS) and polymers.  Results:   Our studies showed that FBS can protect cells from viability loss, even at high-fluence laser irradiation conditions that lead to high levels of intracellular delivery in two different mammalian cell types. Further studies revealed that full FBS was not needed: viability protection was achieved with denatured FBS, with just the high molecular weight fraction of FBS (>30 kDa), or even with individual proteins like albumin or hemoglobin. Finally, we found that viability protection was also obtained using certain neutral water-soluble polymers, including Pluronic F127, polyvinylpyrrolidone, poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline), and polyethylene glycol, which were more effective at increased concentration, molecular weight, or hydrophobicity.  Conclusion:   Altogether, these findings suggest an interaction between amphiphilic domains of polymers with the cell membrane to help cells maintain viability, possibly by facilitating transmembrane pore closure. In this way, serum components or synthetic polymers can be used to increase intracellular delivery by nanoparticle-mediated photoporation while maintaining high cell viability.""","""['Simple Kumar', 'Eunice Lazau', 'Carter Kim', 'Naresh N Thadhani', 'Mark R Prausnitz']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Nanomedicine""","""['Optimization of intracellular macromolecule delivery by nanoparticle-mediated photoporation.', 'Effect of laser fluence, nanoparticle concentration and total energy input per cell on photoporation of cells.', 'Poloxamer surfactant preserves cell viability during photoacoustic delivery of molecules into cells.', 'Nanomaterial-mediated photoporation for intracellular delivery.', 'Lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles as a new generation therapeutic delivery platform: a review.']"""

Objective:   To monitor mortality trends from urologic cancers, including prostate, testis, bladder, and kidney cancers, in Europe.  Design, setting, and participants:   We carried out a time-trend analysis for 36 European countries using the official World Health Organization database.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We extracted the number of deaths and population data over the 1980-2017 period, and calculated age-standardised (world population) mortality rates for each cancer considered, sex, country, and the European Union (EU) as a whole, at all ages; at ages 35-64 yr for prostate, bladder, and kidney cancers; and at ages 20-44 yr for testicular cancer. For selected major countries, we carried out a joinpoint regression analysis to identify significant changes in trends. We also predicted the number of deaths and rates for 2025, using a logarithmic Poisson count data joinpoint regression model.  Results and limitations:   Prostate cancer mortality in the EU decreased over recent years, reaching a rate of 10.3/100 000 in 2015 and a projected rate of 8.9/100 000 in 2025. Less favourable trends were observed in eastern Europe, though starting from relatively low rates. Testicular cancer mortality declined over time in most countries, however levelling off in northern and western countries, after reaching very low rates. EU testicular cancer mortality rate in 2015 was 0.3/100 000 at all ages and 0.6/100 000 at ages 20-44 yr. Bladder cancer mortality trends were less favourable in central and eastern countries compared to northern and western ones. The EU rates in 2015 were 5.1/100 000 men and 1.1/100 000 women. Kidney cancer mortality showed less favourable trends, with a slight increase in men and stable rates in women over the past decade in the EU.  Conclusions:   Mortality from prostate, testis, and bladder cancers, but not from kidney cancer, declined in most European countries, with less favourable trends in most eastern countries.  Patient summary:   Over the past four decades, mortality from prostate, testis, and bladder cancers, but not from kidney cancer, declined in most European countries.

Plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) comprises normal and circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA). Low-pass whole-genome sequencing (lpWGS) of ctDNA can provide information on mCRPC behaviour.  Objective:   To validate and clinically qualify plasma lpWGS for mCRPC.  Design, setting, and participants:   Plasma lpWGS data were obtained for mCRPC patients consenting to optional substudies of two prospective phase 3 trials (FIRSTANA and PROSELICA). In FIRSTANA, chemotherapy-naïve patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel (75 mg/m2) or cabazitaxel (20 or 25 mg/m2). In PROSELICA, patients previously treated with docetaxel were randomised to 20 or 25 mg/m2 cabazitaxel. lpWGS data were generated from 540 samples from 188 mCRPC patients acquired at four different time points (screening, cycle 1, cycle 4, and end of study). OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: lpWGS data for ctDNA were evaluated for prognostic, response, and tumour genomic measures. Associations with response and survival data were determined for tumour fraction. Genomic biomarkers including large-scale transition (LST) scores were explored in the context of prior treatments.  Results and limitations:   Plasma tumour fraction was prognostic for overall survival in univariable and stratified multivariable analyses (hazard ratio 1.75, 95% confidence interval 1.08-2.85; p = 0.024) and offered added value compared to existing biomarkers (C index 0.722 vs 0.709; p = 0.021). Longitudinal changes were associated with drug response. PROSELICA samples were enriched for LSTs (p = 0.029) indicating genomic instability, and this enrichment was associated with prior abiraterone and enzalutamide treatment but not taxane or radiation therapy. Higher LSTs were correlated with losses of RB1/RNASEH2B, independent of BRCA2 loss.  Conclusions:   Plasma lpWGS of ctDNA describes CRPC behaviour, providing prognostic and response data of clinical relevance. The added prognostic value of the ctDNA fraction over established biomarkers should be studied further.  Patient summary:   We studied tumour DNA in blood samples from patients with prostate cancer. We found that levels of tumour DNA in blood were indicative of disease prognosis, and that changes after treatment could be detected. We also observed a ""genetic scar"" in the results that was associated with certain previous treatments. This test allows an assessment of tumour activity that can complement existing tests, offer insights into drug response, and detect clinically relevant genetic changes.""","""['Semini Sumanasuriya', 'George Seed', 'Harry Parr', 'Rossitza Christova', 'Lorna Pope', 'Claudia Bertan', 'Diletta Bianchini', 'Pasquale Rescigno', 'Ines Figueiredo', 'Jane Goodall', 'Gemma Fowler', 'Penelope Flohr', 'Niven Mehra', 'Antje Neeb', 'Jan Rekowski', 'Mario Eisenberger', 'Oliver Sartor', 'Stéphane Oudard', 'Christine Geffriaud-Ricouard', 'Ayse Ozatilgan', 'Mustapha Chadjaa', 'Sandrine Macé', 'Chris Lord', 'Joe Baxter', 'Stephen Pettitt', 'Maryou Lambros', 'Adam Sharp', 'Joaquin Mateo', 'Suzanne Carreira', 'Wei Yuan', 'Johann S de Bono']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Plasma Cell-free DNA Concentration and Outcomes from Taxane Therapy in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer from Two Phase III Trials (FIRSTANA and PROSELICA).', 'Prognostic Value of Low-Pass Whole Genome Sequencing of Circulating Tumor DNA in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Clinical and genomic insights into circulating tumor DNA-based alterations across the spectrum of metastatic hormone-sensitive and castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Predicting therapy response and resistance in metastatic prostate cancer with circulating tumor DNA.', 'What do we know about treatment sequencing of abiraterone, enzalutamide, and chemotherapy in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer?', 'Cell-free DNA in the management of prostate cancer: Current status and future prospective.', 'Recent Advances in Blood-Based Liquid Biopsy Approaches in Prostate Cancer.', 'Combination of C-reactive protein/albumin ratio and time to castration resistance enhances prediction of prognosis for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Early Plasma Circulating Tumor DNA as a Potential Biomarker of Disease Recurrence in Non-metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Circulating Tumor DNA-A Novel Biomarker of Tumor Progression and Its Favorable Detection Techniques.']"""

In this study, we evaluate the performance of implemented DC models in the clinical radiotherapy (RT) planning workflow and report on user experience.  Methods and materials:   DC models were implemented at two cancer centers and used to generate OAR and CTVs for all patients undergoing RT for a central nervous system (CNS), head and neck (H&N), or prostate cancer. Radiation Therapists/Dosimetrists and Radiation Oncologists completed post-contouring surveys rating the degree of edits required for DCs (1 = minimal, 5 = significant) and overall DC satisfaction (1 = poor, 5 = high). Unedited DCs were compared to the edited treatment approved contours using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and 95% Hausdorff distance (HD).  Results:   Between September 19, 2019 and March 6, 2020, DCs were generated on approximately 551 eligible cases. 203 surveys were collected on 27 CNS, 54 H&N, and 93 prostate RT plans, resulting in an overall survey compliance rate of 32%. The majority of OAR DCs required minimal edits subjectively (mean editing score ≤ 2) and objectively (mean DSC and 95% HD was ≥ 0.90 and ≤ 2.0 mm). Mean OAR satisfaction score was 4.1 for CNS, 4.4 for H&N, and 4.6 for prostate structures. Overall CTV satisfaction score (n = 25), which encompassed the prostate, seminal vesicles, and neck lymph node volumes, was 4.1.  Conclusions:   Previously validated OAR DC models for CNS, H&N, and prostate RT planning required minimal subjective and objective edits and resulted in a positive user experience, although low survey compliance was a concern. CTV DC model evaluation was even more limited, but high user satisfaction suggests that they may have served as appropriate starting points for patient specific edits.""","""['Jordan Wong', 'Vicky Huang', 'Derek Wells', 'Joshua Giambattista', 'Jonathan Giambattista', 'Carter Kolbeck', 'Karl Otto', 'Elantholi P Saibishkumar', 'Abraham Alexander']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Comparing deep learning-based auto-segmentation of organs at risk and clinical target volumes to expert inter-observer variability in radiotherapy planning.', 'The dosimetric impact of deep learning-based auto-segmentation of organs at risk on nasopharyngeal and rectal cancer.', 'Clinical feasibility of deep learning-based auto-segmentation of target volumes and organs-at-risk in breast cancer patients after breast-conserving surgery.', 'Auto-segmentation of organs at risk for head and neck radiotherapy planning: From atlas-based to deep learning methods.', 'Clinical implementation of deep-learning based auto-contouring tools-Experience of three French radiotherapy centers.', 'Machine learning in non-small cell lung cancer radiotherapy: A bibliometric analysis.', 'How smart is artificial intelligence in organs delineation?

Study design:   Descriptive, analytical study.  Place and duration of study:   Department of Urology, Erciyes University, Faculty of Medicine, Kayseri, Turkey, between 2012 and 2020.  Methodology:   One hundred patients, who were treated with prostate cancer, were subjected. The PSA values were noted, nadir PSA values were detected, times to nadir PSA, HRPCa, and follow-up times were recorded. PSADT and PSAV were calculated. The relationships between the groups were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate overall survival between the groups.  Results:   The patients were grouped according to the mean PSADT, median PSAV, median nadir PSA, and mean time to HRPCA. The survival of those with high PSADT, low PSAV and low nadir PSA were found to be significantly longer (p=0.006, p<0.001, p<0.001). High PSAV was also associated with significantly increased PSA, nadir PSA and death (p<0.001, p=0.47, and p<0.001, p=0.52, respectively). The survival of those with a longer time to HPRCa was found to be significantly longer (p<0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in terms of survival between patients who received chemotherapy after HRPCa and those who did not (p=0.477). PSAV (p=0.007 HR: 1.004 95% CI: 1.001 - 1.007), bone metastasis at diagnosis (p=0.001 HR: 0.357 95% CI: 0.197 - 0.645) and time to HRPCa development (p=0.001 HR: 0.936 95% CI: 0.900 - 0.974) were significantly effective to the survival. Conclusion: PSADT, PSAV, and nadir PSA serve as independent prognostic markers for survival in patients with HRPCa. These three PSA derived calculation products, with the help of other parameters, could work as prognostic factors, and help clinicians predict survival in men with HRPCa.

However, the frequency of HRR mutations in patients with localized and locally advanced prostate cancer is still unclear. This study investigated the profile of HRR gene mutations in Chinese localized and locally advanced prostate cancer patients.  Materials and methods:   74 patients with localized and locally advanced prostate cancer patients in Beijing Chaoyang Hospital between May 2018 and September 2019 were retrospectively included. Matched prostate cancer and histologically normal tissues were subjected to next-generation sequencing. Pathogenic alterations of 19 HRR genes were examined.  Results:   Ten deleterious and suspected deleterious mutations (4 germline and 6 somatic mutations) were detected in 9 of 74 (12.16 %) patients, occurred in seven HRR-related genes, including CDK12, NBN, ATM, ATR, BRCA2, PALB2 and RAD51C. The mutation frequency of HRR genes in this study (12.16 %) was higher than TCGA cohort (7.29 %), and the mutation sites in 7 HRR genes detected in this cohort were different from those of TCGA data. Patients with HRR gene mutations had higher Gleason grade (≥ 3) (P = 0.03) and risk level (very-high) (P = 0.03). Postoperative prostate specific antigen level and positive surgical margin rate was not associated with HRR gene mutation status.  Conclusions:   This study illustrated the mutation patterns of HRR genes in Chinese population with localized and locally advanced prostate cancer. These results provide further evidence that HRR gene mutations were more prevalent in patients with higher Gleason grade, or with very-high-risk level.

We hypothesized that the advantage of good general health in radical prostatectomy (RP) patients combined with favorable cancer outcomes might lead to even higher overall survival rates over 10 years compared to the LE of a general population.  Methods:   A total of 6483 patients were treated with RP between 1992 and 2007 at the Martini-Klinik Prostate Cancer Center. Preoperative risk classification was performed according to D'Amico. Postoperative risk classification was performed according to the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment score (CAPRA-S). A simulated cohort was created that resembled the exact age distribution of the RP population using Monte Carlo simulation which was based on data derived from official male German life tables (1992-2017). Markov chain was used to represent natural age progression of the simulated cohort. Kaplan-Meier plots were created to display the differences between 10-year observed overall survival (OS) and the simulated, predicted LE.  Results:   For D'Amico low risk and intermediate risk, 10-year OS was 12.0% and 9.2% above predicted LE in the simulated cohort, respectively. For D'Amico high risk, OS was virtually the same as predicted LE (0.8% difference in favor of RP treated patients). For CAPRA-S low and intermediate risk, OS was 11.8% and 9.7% above predicted LE. For CAPRA-S high risk, OS was virtually the same as predicted LE (0.3% difference in favor of the simulated cohort).  Conclusions:   Low- and intermediate risk PCa patients treated with RP can expect a very favorable overall survival, that even exceeds LE predictions. High risk patients' overall survival perfectly aligns with LE predictions.""","""['Christoph Würnschimmel', 'Mike Wenzel', 'Nuowei Wang', 'Zhe Tian', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz', 'Markus Graefen', 'Hartwig Huland', 'Derya Tilki']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Race/Ethnicity may be an Important Predictor of Life Expectancy in Localized Prostate Cancer Patients: Novel Analyses Using Social Security Administration Life Tables.', 'Validation of the Social Security Administration Life Tables (2004-2014) in Localized Prostate Cancer Patients within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database.', 'External validation of the UCSF-CAPRA (University of California, San Francisco, Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment) in Japanese patients receiving radical prostatectomy.', 'Identifying the Most Informative Prediction Tool for Cancer-specific Mortality After Radical Prostatectomy: Comparative Analysis of Three Commonly Used Preoperative Prediction Models.', 'Accuracy of life tables in predicting overall survival in patients after radical prostatectomy.', 'The direct prognosis comparison of 125I low-dose-rate brachytherapy versus laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer.', 'Differences in overall survival of T2N0M0 bladder cancer patients vs. population-based controls according to treatment modalities.', 'Life expectancy in metastatic urothelial bladder cancer patients according to race/ethnicity.', 'The Effect of 10 Most Common Nonurological Primary Cancers on Survival in Men With Secondary Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   Between February 25, 1992, and February 25, 2016, 17,632 men with clinical T1-4 PC with a biopsy GS of 6 to 10 underwent radical prostatectomy at a single academic center.

Results:   The FH and GB techniques demonstrated equivalent yields of ≥Gleason grade group (GGG)-2 prostate cancer (PCa). The FH group had a significantly higher mean number of cores with ≥GGG-2 PCa involvement (p=0.011) but a significantly lower mean number of biopsy samples (p <0.01). The urinary retention rate of the GB group (10%) was significantly higher than that of the FH group (1%; p <0.01). The rates of ≥GGG-2 PCa involvement in the anterior (GB, 31%) and anteromedial (FH, 22%) sectors were higher than those in other sectors (range, 0%-9%). For multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, the rate of ≥GGG-2 PCa detection in the anteromedial prostate (23%) was nearly half that in other locations (range, 38%-55%).  Conclusions:   Compared with GB transperineal biopsy, FH transperineal biopsy demonstrates an equivalent cancer yield with no risk of sepsis, a significantly reduced risk of urinary retention, and reduced anesthesia needs. The higher number of cores with ≥GGG-2 PCa involvement in the FH group suggests that FH transperineal biopsy can sample the prostate better than GB-transperineal biopsy can.""","""['Ahmet Urkmez', 'Cihan Demirel', 'Muammer Altok', 'Tharakeswara K Bathala', 'Daniel D Shapiro', 'John W Davis']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Patient Reported Outcome Measures for Transperineal Template Prostate Mapping Biopsies in the PICTURE Study.', 'Pain in Men Undergoing Transperineal Free-Hand Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Fusion Targeted Biopsies under Local Anesthesia: Outcomes and Predictors from a Multicenter Study of 1,008 Patients.', 'How Many Targeted Biopsy Cores are Needed for Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Detection during Transperineal Magnetic Resonance Imaging Ultrasound Fusion Biopsy?', 'Comparing Three Different Techniques for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Prostate Biopsies: A Systematic Review of In-bore versus Magnetic Resonance Imaging-transrectal Ultrasound fusion versus Cognitive Registration.

Immunohistochemical staining of PTEN was performed on prostate biopsy samples of these patients. Associations among clinicopathological features, patient survival and PTEN protein expression were analyzed. PTEN loss occurred in 58 of 205 (28.3%) patients. Loss of PTEN was significantly correlated with high metastatic volume (P = 0.017). No association between PTEN expression and Gleason score was observed. Patients with PTEN loss had significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS, P < 0.001) and overall survival (OS, P < 0.001) compared with patients with intact PTEN expression. Multivariate analysis showed that elevated alkaline phosphatase, high metastatic volume and PTEN loss were independent poor prognostic factors for PFS. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS)#8805; 2 and PTEN loss were independent poor prognostic factors for OS.

While several efforts have been made to predict the locations of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) at miRNA target sites and associate them with cancer risk and susceptibility, there have been few direct assessments of SNVs in both mature miRNAs and their target sites to assess their impact on miRNA function in cancers. Using genome-wide target capture of miRNAs and miRNA-binding sites followed by deep sequencing in prostate cancer cell lines, here we identified prostate cancer-specific SNVs in mature miRNAs and their target binding sites. SNV rs9860655 in the mature sequence of miR-570 was not present in benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) tissue or cell lines but was detectable in clinical prostate cancer tissue samples and adjacent normal tissue. SLC45A3 (prostein), a putative oncogene target of miR-1178, was highly upregulated in PC3 cells harboring an miR-1178 seed sequence SNV. Finally, systematic assessment of losses and gains of miRNA targets through 3'UTR SNVs revealed SNV-associated changes in target oncogene and tumor suppressor gene expression that might be associated with prostate carcinogenesis.

We aimed to explore the mechanism of action of MEM in prostate cancer (PCa) by employing an in vitro global proteome approach to get useful information of various signaling pathways and effected genes to define the mechanism of MEM action in prostate cancer. We conducted a global proteome analysis of CWR22Rv1after treatment with methanolic extract of MEM. The result of the proteomic profiling of in vitro PCa cells demonstrated the reduction in tumor protein D52 (TPD52) expression after treatment with methanolic extract of MEM. Down-regulation of TPD52 expression at mRNA level was observed by MEM treatment in CWR22Rν1 and C4-2 cells in a dose-dependent fashion probably by cleavage of Caspase 3 and PARP, or by modulation of cyclin-dependent kinases in CWR22Rν1 and C4-2 cells. The progressive character of the TRAMP model demonstrates a chance to evaluate the potential of chemo-preventive agents for both initial and late stages of prostate cancer development, and induction in TPD52 protein expression with development as well as the progression of prostate cancer was observed in the TRAMP model. Analyses of the tissue microarray collection of 25 specimens confirmed the clinical significance of our findings identifying TPD52 as a potential marker for PCa progression. We determined that knockdown of TPD52 (CWR22Rν1 cells), a considerable downregulation was seen at the protein level. Downregulation of TPD52 inhibited the migration and invasive behavior of prostate cancer cells as observed. Moreover, we observed that the siRNA-TPD52 transfection of CWR22Rν1 cells resulted in tumor growth inhibition with a marked reduction in the secretion of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the serum. Intraperitoneal injection of MEM considerably slowed tumor growth in athymic mice, inhibited TPD52 expression, and caused a marked reduction in PSA levels of serum as demonstrated by immunoblot screening and immune-histochemical staining.

Here, we report that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key regulator of HMMR expression, for which its kinase activity is required. Pharmacological inhibitors of mTOR, such as rapamycin and Torin2, markedly suppressed the mRNA level as well as the protein level of HMMR in LNCaP and PC-3 cells. Our data demonstrate that such regulation occurs at the transcription level. HMMR promoter reporter assays revealed that the transcription factor SRF is responsible for the mTOR-mediated transcriptional regulation of HMMR gene. Consistently, the suppression of HMMR expression by Torin2 was noticeably reversed by the overexpression of SRF. Moreover, our findings suggest that the SRF binding sites responsible for the transcriptional regulation of HMMR through the mTOR-SRF axis are located in HMMR promoter sequences carrying the first intron, downstream of the translational start site. Furthermore, the upregulation of HMMR by DHT was abolished by stimulation with rapamycin, prior to DHT treatment, suggesting that mTOR activity is required for the induction of HMMR expression by androgen.

Methods:   We conducted a prospective, single arm, single center open-label, pilot study with Radium-223 in CaP patients with rising PSA (>0.2 ng/ml) following RP + adjuvant/salvage RT. Negative staging with 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and whole-body MRI was mandatory at time of inclusion. Patients were eligible if they exhibited adverse clinico-pathological features predictive of significant recurrence.

Results:   In total, 23 patients were screened of whom 8 patients were included is the study. Radium-223 treatment was safe with no serious treatment related adverse events. One patient developed grade 3 lymphopenia. All patients rapidly developed PSA progression (median PSA progression-free survival: 5.5 months). Eventually all patients experienced clinical recurrence (median clinical recurrence-free survival 11.0 months) of whom only 2 patients developed skeletal recurrence.

Initial data suggests increased uptake in benign lesions compared to [68 Ga]-PSMA-11, and clinical observations found increased unspecific bone uptake (UBU). We therefore investigate the frequency and characteristics of UBU in [18F]-PSMA-1007 PET.  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed [18F]-PSMA-1007 PET scans from four centers for the presence of UBU, defined as a focal mild-to-moderate uptake (SUVmax < 10.0) not obviously related to a benign or malignant cause. If present, up to three leading UBUs were quantified (SUVmax), localized, and correlated to clinical parameters, such as age, PSA, injected dose, Gleason score, tumor size (T1-T4), and type of PET scanner (analog vs. digital). Additionally, clinical and imaging follow-up results and therapeutic impact were evaluated.  Results:   UBUs were identified in 179 out of 348 patients (51.4%). The most frequent localizations were ribs (57.5%) and pelvis (24.8%). The frequency of UBUs was not associated with PSA, Gleason score, tumor size, age, or the injected [18F]-PSMA-1007 dose. UBUs were significantly more frequent in images obtained with digital PET/CT scans (n = 74, 82%) than analog PET/CT scans (n = 221, 40.3%) (p = .0001) but not in digital PET/MR (n = 53, 51%) (p = .1599). In 80 out of 179 patients (44.7%), the interpretation of UBUs was critical for therapeutic management and therefore considered clinically relevant. For 65 UBUs, follow-ups were available: three biopsies, three radiotherapies with PSA follow-up, and 59 cases with imaging. After follow-up, UBUs were still considered unclear in 28 of 65 patients (43%), benign in 28 (43%), and malignant in nine (14%) patients.  Conclusion:   UBUs occur in two-thirds of patients imaged with [18F]-PSMA-1007 PET/CT and are significantly more frequent on digital PET scanners than analog scanners.

The in vivo anticancer actions of MAC were examined as a treatment in the FVB/N c-Neu murine model for spontaneously arising breast cancers. Intratumoral MAC injections (1-4% v/v) significantly suppressed tumor progression in a dose-dependent manner and was associated with greater levels of tumor infiltrating neutrophils exhibiting anticancer cytotoxic activity.

However, the labor-intensive purification procedures for rich-dose and high-purity homogeneous exosomes without using targeting ligands are still a challenging task. Herein, we developed a nanovector Exo-PMA/Fe-HSA@DOX through cloaked by urinary exosome membrane as a chemo/chemodynamic theranostic nano-platform for targeted homologous prostate cancer therapy which pertain to the abrogation of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and its downstream AKT/NF-kB/IkB signaling instead of ERK signaling cascades. Urinary exosomes-based nanovectors own the same urological cancer cell membrane antigen inclusive of E-cadherin, CD 47 and are free from intracellular substance such as Histone 3 and COX Ⅳ. The targeting properties of the homologous cancer cell are well preserved in Exo-PMA/Fe-HSA@DOX nanovectors in high purity. Meanwhile, the nanovectors based on urinary exosomes from prostate patients deeply penetrated into prostate cancer DU145 3D MCTS, and successfully achieve superior synergistic low-dose chemo/chemodynamic performance in vivo. In addition, the blockage of bypassing EGFR/AKT/NF-kB/IkB signaling pathway is greatly enhanced via elevated intracellular PMA/Fe-HSA@DOX nanoparticles (NPs).

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of SBRT in combination with a hydrogel spacer for prostate cancer.  Methods:   This is a prospective single-center, single-arm phase II study. Prostate cancer patients without lymph node or distant metastasis were eligible. All patients received a hydrogel spacer insertion, followed by SBRT of 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions with volumetric modulated arc therapy. The primary endpoint was physician-assessed acute gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity within 3 months. The secondary endpoints were physician-assessed acute genitourinary (GU) toxicity, patient-reported outcomes evaluated by the EPIC and FACT-P questionnaires, and dosimetric comparison. We used propensity score-matched analyses to compare patients with the hydrogel spacer with those without the spacer. The historical data of the control without a hydrogel spacer was obtained from our hospital's electronic records.  Results:   Forty patients were enrolled between February 2017 and July 2018. A hydrogel spacer significantly reduced the dose to the rectum. Grade 2 acute GI and GU toxicity occurred in seven (18%) and 17 (44%) patients. The EPIC bowel and urinary summary score declined from the baseline to the first month (P < 0.01, < 0.01), yet it was still significantly lower in the third month (P < 0.01, P = 0.04). For propensity score-matched analyses, no significant differences in acute GI and GU toxicity were observed between the two groups. The EPIC bowel summary score was significantly better in the spacer group at 1 month (82.2 in the spacer group and 68.5 in the control group).  Conclusions:   SBRT with a hydrogel spacer had the dosimetric benefits of reducing the rectal doses. The use of the hydrogel spacer did not reduce physician-assessed acute toxicity, but it improved patient-reported acute bowel toxicity.

Cyclocreatine (CCR) is a substrate analog of creatine kinase (CK), where its phosphorylated form is a poor phosphate donor in comparison with native bioenergetic molecule, creatine phosphate (Cr-P). The compound CCR has been shown to markedly inhibit the growth of a broad spectrum of cancers, both in vitro and in vivo. Intracellularly, CCR is phosphorylated by CK to yield a synthetic phosphagen [(N-phosphorylcyclocreatine (CCR ~P)], with thermodynamic and kinetic properties distinct from those of creatine phosphate (Cr-P). Distinct inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis has been attributed to CCR accumulation as CCR ~P in tumor cells, especially in those expressing a high level of CK protein, with minimal adverse effects. Unfortunately, the clinical use of CCR against malignancies is quite limited due to its amphoteric nature, which accounts for most of its extremely low membrane permeability, as well as limited oral bioavailability (BA) and poor systemic pharmacokinetics (PK).Our current work describes the encapsulation of CCR , utilizing freeze and thaw vesicles (FTV )-composed mostly of saturated PC, DOPE, and Chol-into stealth™ liposomes , postcoated with 4.5 M% PEG-PE. Following physicochemical characterization, in vitro release and cellular uptake kinetics confirmed efficient delivery of liposomal CCR (CCR-Lip), leading to intracellular accumulation of its CC-P metabolic product. Successful delivery of CCR to cancer cell effectively depleted low energetic cancer cells of ATP significantly mediating myc-induced metabolic changes. CCR-Lip showed significant antimetastatic and anticancer effectiveness against both MCF-7 and PC-3 human carcinoma models (p < 0.05-0.01), with 4- to 6-fold lower IC50 values vs. closest drug control. Such shift in bioenergetics was coupled via AMPK and phospho-p53 to the mitochondrial apoptosis effector Bak , thus inducing a cell-intrinsic mechanism to counteract uncontrolled neoplastic proliferation, in target cancer cells. Our novel liposomal delivery system of the CCR substrate analog demonstrated strong inhibition of malignant cell bioenergetics, leading to significant antineoplastic and proapoptotic actions, against different cancers.""","""['Samayita Ganguly', 'Tamer Elbayoumi']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Methods Mol Biol""","""['Cyclocreatine (1-carboxymethyl-2-iminoimidazolidine) inhibits growth of a broad spectrum of cancer cells derived from solid tumors.', 'Hodgkin disease-derived cell lines expressing ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase show growth inhibition by cyclocreatine treatment independent of apoptosis.', 'In vivo (1)H MRS and (31)P MRSI of the response to cyclocreatine in transgenic mouse liver expressing creatine kinase.', 'Creatine kinase isoenzymes--characterization and functions in cell.', 'Systems bioenergetics of creatine kinase networks: physiological roles of creatine and phosphocreatine in regulation of cardiac cell function.']"""

The median, mean, 75th percentile, and 90th percentile derived from Ktrans and Kep had a moderately positive correlation with Ki-67 expression (r = 0.361-0.450, p < 0.05), in which both the median and mean of Ktrans had the highest positive correlation (r = 0.450, p < 0.05). The diagnostic efficacy of the Ktrans median, mean, 75th percentile, and 90th percentile, along with the Kep -based median and mean was assessed by the ROC curve. The area under the curve (AUC) of the mean for Ktrans was the highest (0.826). When the cut-off of the mean for Ktrans was ≥0.47/min, its Youden index, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.625, 0.871, and 0.754, respectively. The AUC of the median of Kep was the lowest (0.772).  Conclusion:   The histogram of DCE-MRI quantitative parameters is correlated with Ki-67 expression, which has the potential to noninvasively assess the expression of Ki-67 with patients of PCa.""","""['Yongsheng Zhang', 'Zhiping Li', 'Chen Gao', 'Jianliang Shen', 'Mingtao Chen', 'Yufeng Liu', 'Zhijian Cao', 'Peipei Pang', 'Feng Cui', 'Maosheng Xu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Application of whole-lesion histogram analysis of pharmacokinetic parameters in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI of breast lesions with the CAIPIRINHA-Dixon-TWIST-VIBE technique.', 'Quantitative Assessment of Tumor Cell Proliferation in Brain Gliomas with Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI.', 'Comparison of diffusion kurtosis imaging and dynamic contrast enhanced MRI in prediction of prognostic factors and molecular subtypes in patients with breast cancer.', 'High-temporal resolution DCE-MRI improves assessment of intra- and peri-breast lesions categorized as BI-RADS 4.', 'Volume-based histogram analysis of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI for estimation of gliomas IDH1 mutation status.', 'Deep learning-based radiomic nomograms for predicting Ki67 expression in prostate cancer.', 'Ki67 and the apparent diffusion coefficient in postoperative prostate cancer with endocrine therapy.', 'Association Between DCE-MRI Perfusion Histogram Parameters and EGFR and VEGF Expressions in Different Lauren Classifications of Advanced Gastric Cancer.']"""

This study assessed the prognostic differences among various Gleason scores (GSs) classified as GG 4 PC on biopsy before radical prostatectomy (RP).  Methods:   We conducted a multicenter retrospective study, and a total of 1791 patients (GS 3 + 5: 190; GS 4 + 4: 1557; and GS 5 + 3: 44) with biopsy GG 4 were included for analysis. Biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with high-risk surgical pathologic features. Cox regression models were used to analyze time-dependent oncologic endpoints.  Results:   Over a median follow-up of 75 months, 750 patients (41.9%) experienced BCR, 146 (8.2%) died of any causes, and 57 (3.2%) died of PC. Biopsy GS 5 + 3 was associated with significantly higher rates of GS upgrading in RP specimens than GS 3 + 5 and GS 4 + 4. On multivariable analysis adjusted for clinicopathologic features, different GSs within GG 4 were significantly associated with BCR (p = 0.03) but not PC-specific or all-cause mortality. Study limitations include the lack of central pathological specimen evaluation.  Conclusions:   Patients with GG 4 at biopsy exhibited some limited biological and clinical heterogeneity. Specifically, GS 5 + 3 had an increased risk of GS upgrading. This can help individualize patients' counseling and encourage further study to refine biopsy specimen-based GG classification.""","""['Keiichiro Mori#', 'Vidit Sharma#', 'Eva M Comperat', 'Shun Sato', 'Ekaterina Laukhtina', 'Victor M Schuettfort', 'Benjamin Pradere', 'Reza Sari Motlagh', 'Hadi Mostafaei', 'Fahad Quhal', 'Mehdi Kardoust Parizi', 'Mohammad Abufaraj', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz', 'Shin Egawa', 'Derya Tilki', 'Stephen A Boorjian', 'Shahrokh F Shariat']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Ann Surg Oncol""","""['Differential prognostic impact of different Gleason patterns in grade group 4 in radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'The prognostic impact of downgrading and upgrading from biopsy to radical prostatectomy among men with Gleason score 7 prostate cancer.', 'New Prostate Cancer Grading System Predicts Long-term Survival Following Surgery for Gleason Score 8-10 Prostate Cancer.', 'Tertiary Gleason pattern in radical prostatectomy specimens is associated with worse outcomes than the next higher Gleason score group in localized prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of Gleason Grade Group 5 in a Contemporary Prostate Cancer Grading System and Literature Review.', 'Prognostic differences among Grade Group 4 subgroups in robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.']"""

Seven clinical features of anaplastic prostate cancer have been prospectively identified. In this phase II clinical trial, we identified mutations, including DNA damage repair (DDR) mutations, in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who were treated with durvalumab and olaparib and determined how many of them can be described as anaplastic, and we examined the overlap between anaplastic features and DDR mutations.  Methods:   Eligible patients with mCRPC received prior enzalutamide, abiraterone, or both. Patients were treated with durvalumab 1500 mg i.v. every 28 days and olaparib 300 mg p.o. every 12 hours until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients underwent mandatory baseline biopsies of metastatic lesions.  Results:   Baseline characteristics were similar between anaplastic and nonanaplastic patients. Eleven patients (20%) displayed clear anaplastic features, and 43 (78.2%) lacked anaplastic features. In the anaplastic group, 2/11 (18.2%) had germline DRR mutations, and 4/11 (36.3%) had somatic DDR mutations.

However, there is limited evidence regarding decisional outcomes associated with the choice between robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) and radiotherapy, when both treatment options are available in the public health system. There is increasing support for multidisciplinary approaches to guide men with LPC in their decision-making process. This study assessed decisional outcomes in men deciding between RARP or radiotherapy treatment before and after attending a LPC combined clinic (CC).  Methods:   Quantitative longitudinal data were collected from 52 men who attended a LPC CC, where they saw both a urologist and radiation oncologist. Patients completed questionnaires assessing involvement in decision-making, decisional conflict, satisfaction and regret before and after the CC, three months, six months and 12 months post-treatment. Urologists and radiation oncologists also reported their perceptions regarding patients' suitability for, openness to, perceived preferences and appropriateness for each treatment. Data was analysed using paired/independent samples t-tests and McNemar's tests.  Results:   Most participants (n = 37, 71%) opted for RARP over radiotherapy (n = 14, 27%); one participant deferred treatment (2%). Urologists and radiation oncologists reported low agreement (κ = 0.26) regarding the most appropriate treatment for each patient. Participants reported a desire for high levels of control over their decision-making process (77.5% patient-led, 22.5% shared) and high levels of decisional satisfaction (M = 4.4, SD = 0.47) after the CC. Decisional conflict levels were significantly reduced (baseline: M = 29.3, SD = 16.9, post-CC: M = 16.3, SD = 11.5; t = 5.37, P < 0.001) after the CC. Mean decisional regret scores were 'mild' at three-months (M = 16.0, SD = 17.5), six-months (M = 18.8, SD = 18.7) and 12-months (M = 18.2, SD = 15.1) post-treatment completion.  Conclusion:   This is the first Australian study to assess decisional outcomes when patients are offered the choice between RARP and radiotherapy in the public health system. A CC seems to support decision-making in men with LPC and positively impact some decisional outcomes.

Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed our multicenter database comprising 6,039 consecutive patients. The optimal preoperative SII cut-off value was assessed with the Youden index calculated on a time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Logistic regression and Cox regression analyses were used to investigate the association of SII with pathologic features and biochemical recurrence (BCR), respectively. The discriminatory ability of the models was evaluated by calculating the concordance-indices (C-Index). The clinical benefit of the implementation of SII in clinical decision making was assessed using decision curve analysis (DCA).  Results:   Patients with high preoperative SII (≥ 620) were more likely to have adverse clinicopathologic features. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, high preoperative SII was independently associated with extracapsular extension (odds ratio [OR] 1.16, P = 0.041), non-organ confined disease (OR 1.18, P = 0.022), and upgrading at RP (OR 1.23, P < 0.001). We built two Cox regression models including preoperative and postoperative variables. In the preoperative multivariable model, high preoperative SII was associated with BCR (hazard ratio [HR] 1.34, 95% CI 1.15-1.55, P < 0.001). In the postoperative multivariable model, SII was not associated with BCR (P = 0.078). The addition of SII to established models did not improve their discriminatory ability nor did it increase the clinical net benefit on DCA.  Conclusion:   In men treated with RP for clinically nonmetastatic PCa, high preoperative SII was statistically associated with an increased risk of adverse pathologic features at RP as well as BCR. However, it did not improve the predictive accuracy and clinical value beyond that obtained by current predictive and prognostic models.

Indeed, it is well-known that polyamine transport system is upregulated in tumor cells. 3',4,4',5'-tetramethoxychalcone was selected as parent chalcone since it was found to be an efficient anti-proliferative agent on various cancer cells. A series of five chalcone-polyamine conjugates was obtained using the 4-bromopropyloxy-3',4',5'-trimethoxychalcone as a key intermediate. Chalcone core and polyamine tails were fused through an amine bond. These conjugates were found to possess a marked in vitro antiproliferative effect against colorectal (HT-29 and HCT-116) and prostate cancer (PC-3 and DU-145) cell lines. The most active conjugate (compound 8b) was then chosen for further biological evaluations to elucidate mechanisms responsible for its antiproliferative activity. Investigations on cell cycle distribution revealed that this conjugate can prevent the proliferation of human colorectal and prostate cancer cells by blocking the cell cycle at the G1 and G2 phase, respectively. Flow cytometry analysis revealed a sub-G1 peak, characteristic of apoptotic cell population and our inquiries highlighted apoptosis induction at early and later stages through several pro-apoptotic markers.

Moreover, enormous heterogeneity has been commonly observed in the identity, frequency and location of these aberrations across individuals with the same cancer type or subtype, and this variation naturally propagates to the transcriptome, resulting in myriad types of dysregulated gene expression programs. Many have argued that a more integrative and quantitative analysis of heterogeneity of DNA and RNA molecular profiles may be necessary for designing more systematic explorations of alternative therapies and improving predictive accuracy. We introduce a representation of multi-omics profiles which is sufficiently rich to account for observed heterogeneity and support the construction of quantitative, integrated, metrics of variation. Starting from the network of interactions existing in Reactome, we build a library of ""paired DNA-RNA aberrations"" that represent prototypical and recurrent patterns of dysregulation in cancer; each two-gene ""Source-Target Pair"" (STP) consists of a ""source"" regulatory gene and a ""target"" gene whose expression is plausibly ""controlled"" by the source gene. The STP is then ""aberrant"" in a joint DNA-RNA profile if the source gene is DNA-aberrant (e.g., mutated, deleted, or duplicated), and the downstream target gene is ""RNA-aberrant"", meaning its expression level is outside the normal, baseline range. With M STPs, each sample profile has exactly one of the 2M possible configurations. We concentrate on subsets of STPs, and the corresponding reduced configurations, by selecting tissue-dependent minimal coverings, defined as the smallest family of STPs with the property that every sample in the considered population displays at least one aberrant STP within that family. These minimal coverings can be computed with integer programming. Given such a covering, a natural measure of cross-sample diversity is the extent to which the particular aberrant STPs composing a covering vary from sample to sample; this variability is captured by the entropy of the distribution over configurations. We apply this program to data from TCGA for six distinct tumor types (breast, prostate, lung, colon, liver, and kidney cancer). This enables an efficient simplification of the complex landscape observed in cancer populations, resulting in the identification of novel signatures of molecular alterations which are not detected with frequency-based criteria. Estimates of cancer heterogeneity across tumor phenotypes reveals a stable pattern: entropy increases with disease severity. This framework is then well-suited to accommodate the expanding complexity of cancer genomes and epigenomes emerging from large consortia projects.""","""['Qian Ke', 'Wikum Dinalankara', 'Laurent Younes', 'Donald Geman', 'Luigi Marchionni']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""PLoS Comput Biol""","""['Targeted DNA and RNA Sequencing of Paired Urothelial and Squamous Bladder Cancers Reveals Discordant Genomic and Transcriptomic Events and Unique Therapeutic Implications.', 'Digitizing omics profiles by divergence from a baseline.', 'Integrative network analysis to identify aberrant pathway networks in ovarian cancer.', 'High-throughput «Omics» technologies: New tools for the study of triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Translational Metabolomics of Head Injury: Exploring Dysfunctional Cerebral Metabolism with Ex Vivo NMR Spectroscopy-Based Metabolite Quantification.']"""

Because of the potential for disparate grades, an optimal method for pathology reporting MRI lesion grade awaits validation. We examined our institutional experience on the concordance of biopsy grade with subsequent radical prostatectomy (RP) grade of targeted lesions when grade is determined on individual versus aggregate core basis. For 317 patients (with 367 lesions) who underwent MRI-targeted biopsy followed by RP, targeted lesion grade was assigned as (1) global Grade Group (GG), aggregated positive cores; (2) highest GG (highest grade in single biopsy core); and (3) largest volume GG (grade in the core with longest cancer linear length). The 3 biopsy grades were compared (equivalence, upgrade, or downgrade) with the final grade of the lesion in the RP, using κ and weighted κ coefficients. The biopsy global, highest, and largest GGs were the same as the final RP GG in 73%, 68%, 62% cases, respectively (weighted κ: 0.77, 0.79, and 0.71). For cases where the targeted lesion biopsy grade scores differed from each other when assigned by global, highest, and largest GG, the concordance with the targeted lesion RP GG was 69%, 52%, 31% for biopsy global, highest, and largest GGs tumors (weighted κ: 0.65, 0.68, 0.59). Overall, global, highest, and largest GG of the targeted biopsy show substantial agreement with RP-targeted lesion GG, however targeted global GG yields slightly better agreement than either targeted highest or largest GG. This becomes more apparent in nearly one third of cases when each of the 3 targeted lesion level biopsy scores differ. These results support the use of global (aggregate) GG for reporting of MRI lesion-targeted biopsies, while further validations are awaited.""","""['Fang-Ming Deng', 'Bogdan Isaila', 'Derek Jones', 'Qinghu Ren', 'Park Kyung', 'Deepthi Hoskoppal', 'Hongying Huang', 'Leili Mirsadraei', 'Yuhe Xia', 'Jonathan Melamed']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['Optimized grade group for reporting prostate cancer grade in systematic and MRI-targeted biopsies.', 'Defining the optimal method for reporting prostate cancer grade and tumor extent on magnetic resonance/ultrasound fusion-targeted biopsies.', 'Prostate magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsy global grade correlates better than highest grade with prostatectomy grade.', 'The 2019 Genitourinary Pathology Society (GUPS) White Paper on Contemporary Grading of Prostate Cancer.', 'Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.']"""

Projecting cancer incidence can help the cancer control community plan and evaluate prevention strategies aimed at reducing the growing number of cancer cases.  Methods:   We used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program and the US Census Bureau to estimate average, annual, age-standardized cancer incidence rates and case counts (for all sites combined and top 22 invasive cancers) in the US for 2015 and to project cancer rates and counts to 2050. We used age, period, and cohort models to inform projections.  Results:   Between 2015 and 2050, we predict the overall age-standardized incidence rate (proxy for population risk for being diagnosed with cancer) to stabilize in women (1%) and decrease in men (-9%). Cancers with the largest change in risk include a 34% reduction for lung and bronchus and a 32% increase for corpus uterine (32%). Because of the growth and aging of the US population, we predict that the annual number of cancer cases will increase 49%, from 1,534,500 in 2015 to 2,286,300 in 2050, with the largest percentage increase among adults aged ≥75 years. Cancers with the largest projected absolute increase include female breast, colon and rectum, and prostate.  Discussion:   By 2050, we predict the total number of incident cases to increase by almost 50% as a result of the growth and aging of the US population.

To evaluate the operating characteristics of recent survival machine learning methods for the estimation of treatment effect heterogeneity and inform better practice, we carry out a comprehensive simulation study presenting a wide range of settings describing confounded heterogeneous survival treatment effects and varying degrees of covariate overlap. Our results suggest that the nonparametric Bayesian Additive Regression Trees within the framework of accelerated failure time model (AFT-BART-NP) consistently yields the best performance, in terms of bias, precision, and expected regret. Moreover, the credible interval estimators from AFT-BART-NP provide close to nominal frequentist coverage for the individual survival treatment effect when the covariate overlap is at least moderate. Including a nonparametrically estimated propensity score as an additional fixed covariate in the AFT-BART-NP model formulation can further improve its efficiency and frequentist coverage.

The aim of our study was to compare the cancer detection rate (CDR) and the clinically significant prostate cancer detection rate (csPCa) of the magnetic resonance/ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy with those of the standard systematic biopsy (Sbs) and of the combination of both techniques.  Material and methods:   A total of 182 patients underwent magnetic resonance/ultrasound fusion Tbs on the prostate for PCa suspicion based on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mMRI) detection of lesions with PI-RADSv2 score ≥3. A total of 78 patients had prior negative biopsies. Tb was performed by taking 2-4 cores from each suspected lesion, followed by Sb with 12 cores. We evaluated the overall detection rate of PCa and clinically significant prostate cancer, defined as any PCa with Gleason score ≥3+4.  Results:   Median prostate specific antigen (PSA) level pre-biopsy was 7.4 ng/ml and median free-PSA/PSA ratio was 10.2%. Patient median age was 62 years old. PIRADSv2 score was 3 in 54 cases, 4 in 96 cases and 5 in 32 cases. PI-RADS-dependent detection rate of Tbs for scores 3, 4 and 5 was 25.9%, 65.6% and 84.4%, respectively, with csPCa detection rates of 24.1%, 54.2%, and 71.9%. Overall detection rate was 57.1% for Tbs, which increased to 60.4% by adding Sbs results. Detection rate for clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) was 48.4% and increased to 51.1% by adding Sbs. Overall detection rate for repeated biopsy was 50% and 68.3% for biopsy in naïve patients. Sbs detection rate was 55.5%, 8 patients having a negative biopsy on Tbs.

Prostate tumorigenesis is a multi-stage process that ultimately tends to advance to become metastatic PCa. Once PCa patients develop skeletal metastases, they eventually succumb to the disease. Therefore, it is imperative to identify essential molecular drivers of this process to develop new therapeutic alternatives for the treatment of this devastating disease. Here, we have identified MAP4K4 as a relevant gene for metastasis in PCa. Our work shows that genetic deletion of MAP4K4 or pharmacological inhibition of its encoded kinase, HGK, inhibits metastatic PCa cells migration and clonogenic properties. Hence, MAP4K4 might promote metastasis and tumor growth. Mechanistically, our results indicate that HGK depleted cells exhibit profound differences in F-actin organization, increasing cell spreading and focal adhesion stability. Additionally, HGK depleted cells fails to respond to TNF-α stimulation and chemoattractant action. Moreover, here we show that HGK upregulation in PCa samples from TCGA and other databases correlates with a poor prognosis of the disease. Hence, we suggest that it could be used as prognostic biomarker to predict the appearance of an aggressive phenotype of PCa tumors and ultimately, the appearance of metastasis. In summary, our results highlight an essential role for HGK in the dissemination of PCa cells and its potential use as prognostic biomarker.""","""['Sara Garcia-Garcia#', 'Maria Rodrigo-Faus#', 'Noelia Fonseca', 'Sara Manzano', 'Balázs Győrffy', 'Alberto Ocaña', 'Paloma Bragado', 'Almudena Porras', 'Alvaro Gutierrez-Uzquiza']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Uro-Science.', 'Elevated expression of Par3 promotes prostate cancer metastasis by forming a Par3/aPKC/KIBRA complex and inactivating the hippo pathway.', 'MicroRNA-224 inhibits progression of human prostate cancer by downregulating TRIB1.', 'Silencing ACTG1 Expression Induces Prostate Cancer Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition Through MAPK/ERK Signaling Pathway.', 'The metastatic cascade in prostate cancer.', 'Quantitative cell imaging approaches to metastatic state profiling.', 'Molecular Insights of MAP4K4 Signaling in Inflammatory and Malignant Diseases.', 'MAP4K4 promotes ovarian cancer metastasis through diminishing ADAM10-dependent N-cadherin cleavage.', 'Associations between Body Mass Index and Prostate Cancer: The Impact on Progression-Free Survival.', 'The molecular basis of the dichotomous functionality of MAP4K4 in proliferation and cell motility control in cancer.', 'MOP and NOP receptor interaction: Studies with a dual expression system and bivalent peptide ligands.']"""

Thus, FKBP4 has been recognized to play a critical role in several hormone-dependent cancers, including breast and prostate cancer. However, there is still no research to address the role of FKBP4 on lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) progression. We found that FKBP4 expression was elevated in LUAD samples and predicted significantly shorter overall survival based on TCGA and our cohort of LUAD patients. Furthermore, FKBP4 robustly increased the proliferation, metastasis, and invasion of LUAD in vitro and vivo. Mechanistic studies revealed the interaction between FKBP4 and IKK kinase complex. We found that FKBP4 potentiated IKK kinase activity by interacting with Hsp90 and IKK subunits and promoting Hsp90/IKK association. Also, FKBP4 promotes the binding of IKKγ to IKKβ, which supported the facilitation role in IKK complex assembly. We further identified that FKBP4 TPR domains are essential for FKBP4/IKK interaction since its association with Hsp90 is required. In addition, FKBP4 PPIase domains are involved in FKBP4/IKKγ interaction. Interestingly, the association between FKBP4 and Hsp70/RelA favors the transport of RelA toward the nucleus. Collectively, FKBP4 integrates FKBP4/Hsp90/IKK with FKBP4/Hsp70/RelA complex to potentiate the transcriptional activity and nuclear translocation of NF-κB, thereby promoting LUAD progression.

Mechanisms of resistance to apalutamide in nmCRPC require evaluation.  Patients and methods:   In a subset of patients from SPARTAN, aberrations were assessed at baseline and end of study treatment (EOST) using targeted next-generation sequencing or qRT-PCR. Circulating-tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels were assessed qualitatively. Select aberrations in androgen receptor (AR) and other common PC-driving genes were detected and summarized by the treatment group; genomic aberrations were summarized in ctDNA-positive samples. Association between detection of aberrations in all patients and outcomes was assessed using Cox proportional-hazards models and multivariate analysis.  Results:   In 247 patients, the overall prevalence of ctDNA, AR aberrations, and TP53 inactivation increased from baseline (40.6%, 13.6%, and 22.2%) to EOST (57.1%, 25.4%, and 35.0%) and was comparable between treatment groups at EOST. In patients who received subsequent androgen signaling inhibition after study treatment, detectable biomarkers at EOST were significantly associated with poor outcomes: ctDNA with PFS2 or OS (HR, 2.01 or 2.17, respectively; P < 0.0001 for both), any AR aberration with PFS2 (1.74; P = 0.024), and TP53 or BRCA2 inactivation with OS (2.06; P = 0.003; or 3.1; P < 0.0001).

Bioinformatics analysis was used to uncover the possible biological functions of CAFs.  Results:   More CAFs were identified in PCa tissues than in NATs. High density of CAFs may be associated with advanced-stage disease, higher Gleason scores, lymphatic metastases, higher PSA, and poor biochemical recurrence-free survival in PCa. Bioinformatics analysis showed that CAFs may regulate tumor progression and recurrence through ECM modification, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and regulation of cytoskeleton.

Materials and methods:   We conducted a retrospective analysis using data from a prospective cohort in the Prostate Cancer Research International: Active Surveillance (PRIAS)-JAPAN study between January 2010 and August 2019. We used the Short Form 8 Health Survey (SF-8), as patient-reported outcomes, to assess HRQOL at AS enrollment and the first year of the protocol.

The primary outcome was the evaluation of the association of HRQOL at enrollment on the first repeat biopsy compliance. The secondary outcome was the comparison of SF-8 scores during AS, stratified by repeat protocol biopsy compliance.  Results:   Of 805 patients who proceeded to the first year of the protocol, the non-compliance rate was 15% (121 patients). In the adjusted model, lower MCS at enrollment was significantly associated with the first repeat protocol biopsy non-compliance (odds ratio [OR], 2.134; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.031-4.42; P = 0.041) but not in lower PCS (OR, 0.667; 95% CI, 0.294-1.514; P = 0.333). All subscales of SF-8 were lower in the non-compliance group than in the compliance group at any point. MCS in the non-compliance group improved over time from the time of AS enrollment (2.34 increased, P = 0.152).

Independent readouts including metabolic activity and live-cell imaging-based features provided robust measures of organoid growth and complementary ways of assessing drug efficacy. Single organoid analyses enabled in-depth assessment of morphological differences between patients and within organoid populations and revealed that larger organoids had more striking changes in morphology and composition after drug treatment.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and clinical significance of incidental findings on whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) with DWIBS.  Methods:   Data from 124 patients with prostate cancer (age, 76.5 ± 5.6 years), who underwent 1.5 T WB-MRI with STIR, TSE-T2, TSE-T1, In/Out GRE, and DWIBS sequences, were retrospectively analyzed. Findings unrelated to prostate cancer were considered as incidental findings and categorized into two groups based on their clinical implications as follows: imaging follow-up or additional examinations was required (significant incidental findings) and no need to additional work-up (non-significant incidental findings). A chi-square test was performed to compare the differences in the prevalence of significant incidental findings based on age (≤75 and>75 years old).  Results:   A total of 334 incidental findings were found with 8.1% (n = 27) as significant incidental findings. Significant incidental findings were more frequent in patients over 75 years old than those of 75 years old or younger (28.6% vs 11.1%, p = 0.018).

Materials and methods:   Data for all adult, elective RPs for cancer during the period January 2013-December 2018 (inclusive) were extracted from the HES database. The HES database records data on all National Health Service (NHS) hospital admissions in England. Data were extracted for the NHS trust and surgeon undertaking the procedure, the surgical technique used (laparoscopic, open or robot-assisted), hospital length of stay (LOS), emergency readmissions, and deaths. Multilevel modelling was used to adjust for hierarchy and covariates.  Results:   Data were available for 35 629 RPs (27 945 RARPs). The proportion of procedures conducted as RARPs increased from 53.2% in 2013 to 92.6% in 2018. For RARP, there was a significant relationship between 90-day emergency hospital readmission (primary outcome) and trust volume (odds ratio [OR] for volume decrease of 10 procedures: 0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.99-1.00; P = 0.037) and surgeon volume (OR for volume decrease of 10 procedures: 0.99, 95% CI 0.99-1.00; P = 0.013) in the previous year. From lowest to highest volume category there was a decline in the adjusted proportion of patients readmitted as an emergency at 90 days from 10.6% (0-49 procedures) to 7.0% (≥300 procedures) for trusts and from 9.4% (0-9 procedures) to 8.3% (≥100 procedures) for surgeons. LOS was also significantly associated with surgeon and trust volume, although 1-year mortality was associated with neither.

This modification subsequently increases the phosphorylation activity of HIPK2 toward HP1γ, and then promotes the dissociation of HP1γ from trimethylated (Lys9) histone H3 (H3K9me3) to initiate DNA damage repair.

In this study, a nomogram incorporating MTD and PSA nadir was developed to predict BCR-free survival (BCRFS).  Methods:   A total of 337 patients who underwent RP between January 2010 and March 2017 were retrospectively enrolled in this study. The maximum diameter of the index lesion was measured on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cox regression analysis was performed to evaluate independent predictors of BCR. A nomogram was subsequently developed for the prediction of BCRFS at 3 and 5 years after RP. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and decision curve analyses were performed to identify the advantage of the new nomogram in comparison with the cancer of the prostate risk assessment post-surgical (CAPRA-S) score.  Results:   A novel nomogram was developed to predict BCR by including PSA nadir, MTD, Gleason score, surgical margin (SM), and seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), considering these variables were significantly associated with BCR in both univariate and multivariate analyses (P < 0.05). In addition, a basic model including Gleason score, SM, and SVI was developed and used as a control to assess the incremental predictive power of the new model. The concordance index of our model was slightly higher than CAPRA-S model (0.76 vs. 0.70, P = 0.02) and it was significantly higher than that of the basic model (0.76 vs. 0.66, P = 0.001). Time-dependent ROC curve and decision curve analyses also demonstrated the advantages of the new nomogram.

Among these genes, 68 were associated with biochemical recurrence at 3 years after prostatectomy in prostate adenocarcinoma. After adjusting for the minimal sets of confounding covariates, 14 genes (TNFRSF4, ZAP70, ERMN, CXCL5, SPINK6, SLC6A18, CHRM2, TG, CLLU1OS, POSTN, CTSG, NETO1, CEACAM7, and IGLV3-22) related to the microenvironment were identified as prognostic biomarkers using the targeted maximum likelihood estimation. Both the average and individual causal effects were obtained to measure the magnitude of the effect. CIBERSORT and gene set enrichment analyses showed that these prognostic genes were mainly associated with immune responses. POSTN and NETO1 were correlated with androgen receptor expression, a main driver of prostate adenocarcinoma progression. Finally, five genes were validated in another prostate adenocarcinoma cohort (GEO: GSE70770). These findings might lead to the improved prognosis of prostate adenocarcinoma.""","""['Xiaoru Sun', 'Lu Wang', 'Hongkai Li', 'Chuandi Jin', 'Yuanyuan Yu', 'Lei Hou', 'Xinhui Liu', 'Yifan Yu', 'Ran Yan', 'Fuzhong Xue']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Aging (Albany NY)""","""['Novel immune-related signature for risk stratification and prognosis in prostatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Identification of prognosis-related genes in the tumor microenvironment of stomach adenocarcinoma by TCGA and GEO datasets.', 'Ribonucleotide reductase small subunit M2 is a master driver of aggressive prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic values of GPNMB identified by mining TCGA database and STAD microenvironment.', 'Tissue-Based MicroRNAs as Predictors of Biochemical Recurrence after Radical Prostatectomy: What Can We Learn from Past Studies?', 'ZAP70 interaction with 13 mRNAs as a potential immunotherapeutic target for endometrial cancer.', 'Whole-exome sequencing of Indian prostate cancer reveals a novel therapeutic target: POLQ.', 'ZAP70 Activation Compensates for Loss of Class IA PI3K Isoforms Through Activation of the JAK-STAT3 Pathway.', 'Predicting biochemical-recurrence-free survival using a three-metabolic-gene risk score model in prostate cancer patients.', 'SPINKs in Tumors: Potential Therapeutic Targets.']"""

We determined the extent to which germline mutation profiling guides therapy selection in patients with advanced cancer.  Methods:   Patients with cancer undergoing tumor genomic profiling were prospectively consented for germline cancer predisposition gene analysis (2015-2019). In patients harboring germline likely pathogenic or pathogenic (LP/P) alterations, therapeutic actionability was classified using a precision oncology knowledge base. Patients with metastatic or recurrent cancer receiving germline genotype-directed therapy were determined.  Results:   Among 11,947 patients across > 50 malignancies, 17% (n = 2,037) harbored a germline LP/P variant. By oncology knowledge base classification, 9% (n = 1042) had an LP/P variant in a gene with therapeutic implications (4% level 1; 4% level 3B; < 1% level 4). BRCA1/2 variants accounted for 42% of therapeutically actionable findings, followed by CHEK2 (13%), ATM (12%), mismatch repair genes (11%), and PALB2 (5%). When limited to the 9,079 patients with metastatic or recurrent cancer, 8% (n = 710) harbored level 1 or 3B genetic findings and 3.2% (n = 289) received germline genotype-directed therapy. Germline genotype-directed therapy was received by 61% and 18% of metastatic cancer patients with level 1 and level 3B findings, respectively, and by 54% of BRCA1/2, 75% of mismatch repair, 43% of PALB2, 35% of RAD51C/D, 24% of BRIP1, and 19% of ATM carriers. Of BRCA1/2 patients receiving a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, 45% (84 of 188) had tumors other than breast or ovarian cancer, wherein the drug, at time of delivery, was delivered in an investigational setting.  Conclusion:   In a pan-cancer analysis, 8% of patients with advanced cancer harbored a germline variant with therapeutic actionability with 40% of these patients receiving germline genotype-directed treatment. Germline sequence analysis is additive to tumor sequence analysis for therapy selection and should be considered for all patients with advanced cancer.""","""['Zsofia K Stadler', 'Anna Maio', 'Debyani Chakravarty', 'Yelena Kemel', 'Margaret Sheehan', 'Erin Salo-Mullen', 'Kaitlyn Tkachuk', 'Christopher J Fong', 'Bastien Nguyen', 'Amanda Erakky', 'Karen Cadoo', 'Ying Liu', 'Maria I Carlo', 'Alicia Latham', 'Hongxin Zhang', 'Ritika Kundra', 'Shaleigh Smith', 'Jesse Galle', 'Carol Aghajanian', 'Nadeem Abu-Rustum', 'Anna Varghese', ""Eileen M O'Reilly"", 'Michael Morris', 'Wassim Abida', 'Michael Walsh', 'Alexander Drilon', 'Gowtham Jayakumaran', 'Ahmet Zehir', 'Marc Ladanyi', 'Ozge Ceyhan-Birsoy', 'David B Solit', 'Nikolaus Schultz', 'Michael F Berger', 'Diana Mandelker', 'Luis A Diaz Jr', 'Kenneth Offit', 'Mark E Robson']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Detection of Pathogenic Germline Variants Among Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer Undergoing Tumor Genomic Profiling for Precision Medicine.', 'Comparison of BRCA versus non-BRCA germline mutations and associated somatic mutation profiles in patients with unselected breast cancer.', 'Gene-based Confirmatory Germline Testing Following Tumor-only Sequencing of Prostate Cancer.', 'Homologous Recombination Deficiencies and Hereditary Tumors.', 'An Emerging Paradigm for Germline Testing in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma and Immediate Implications for Clinical Practice: A Review.', 'Molecular portraits of cell cycle checkpoint kinases in cancer evolution, progression, and treatment responsiveness.', 'Germline Genetic Testing After Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Universal Germline and Tumor Genomic Testing Needed to Win the War Against Cancer: Genomics Is the Diagnosis.', 'Assessment of a Peer Physician Coaching Partnership Between a Designated Cancer Center Genetics Service and a Community Cancer Network Hospital.', 'Global Oncology Medical Diplomacy Working Group Inaugural Meeting: Defining Worldwide Barriers to Germline Genomics in Cancer Prevention and Management.']"""

Methodology:   Analytical cohort study of patients with cancer and COVID-19 infection in Colombia. From April 1 to October 31, 2020. Demographic and clinical variables related to cancer and COVID-19 infection were collected. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality from all causes. The association between the outcome and the prognostic variables was analyzed using logistic regression models and survival analysis with Cox regression.  Results:   The study included 742 patients; 72% were >51 years. The most prevalent neoplasms were breast (132, 17.77%), colorectal (92, 12.34%), and prostate (81, 10.9%). Two hundred twenty (29.6%) patients were asymptomatic and 96 (26.3%) died. In the bivariate descriptive analysis, higher mortality occurred in patients who were >70 years, patients with lung cancer, ≥2 comorbidities, former smokers, receiving antibiotics, corticosteroids, and anticoagulants, residents of rural areas, low socioeconomic status, and increased acute-phase reactants. In the logistic regression analysis, higher mortality was associated with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) 3 (odds ratio [OR] 28.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.2-99.6); ECOG PS 4 (OR 20.89; 95% CI, 3.36-129.7); two complications from COVID-19 (OR 5.3; 95% CI, 1.50-18.1); and cancer in progression (OR 2.08; 95% CI, 1.01-4.27). In the Cox regression analysis, the statistically significant hazard ratios (HR) were metastatic disease (HR 1.58; 95% CI, 1.16-2.16), cancer in progression (HR 1.08; 95% CI, 1.24-2.61) cancer in partial response (HR 0.31; 95% CI, 0.11-0.88), use of steroids (HR 1.44; 95% CI, 1.01-2.06), and use of antibiotics (HR 2.11; 95% CI, 1.47-2.95).  Conclusion:   In our study, patients with cancer have higher mortality due to COVID-19 infection if they have active cancer, metastatic or progressive cancer, ECOG PS >2, and low socioeconomic status.  Implications for practice:   This study's findings raise the need to carefully evaluate patients with metastatic cancer, in progression, and with impaired Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status to define the relevance of cancer treatment during the pandemic, consider the risk/benefit of the interventions, and establish clear and complete communication with the patients and their families about the risk of complications.

(Siegel et al. [2019] CA: A Cancer J Clin.69(1):7-34.) Focal laser ablation (FLA) has the potential to control small tumors while preserving urinary and erectile function by leaving the neurovascular bundles and urethral sphincters intact. Accurate needle guidance is critical to the success of FLA. Multiparametric magnetic resonance images (mpMRI) can be used to identify targets, guide needles, and assess treatment outcomes. The purpose of this work was to design and evaluate the accuracy of an MR-compatible mechatronic system for in-bore transperineal guidance of FLA ablation needles to localized lesions in the prostate.  Methods:   The mechatronic system was constructed entirely of non-ferromagnetic materials, with actuation controlled by piezoelectric motors and optical encoders. The needle guide hangs between independent front and rear two-link arms, which allows for horizontal and vertical translation as well as pitch and yaw rotation of the guide with a 6.0 cm range of motion in each direction. Needles are inserted manually through a chosen hole in the guide, which has been aligned with the target in the prostate. Open-air positioning error was evaluated using an optical tracking system (0.25 mm RMS accuracy) to measure 125 trajectories in free space. Correction of systematic bias in the system was performed using 85 of the trajectories, and the remaining 40 were used to estimate the residual error. The error was calculated as the horizontal and vertical displacement between the axis of the desired and measured trajectories at a typical needle insertion depth of 10 cm. MR-compatibility was evaluated using a grid phantom to assess image degradation due to the presence of the system, and induced force, heating, and electrical interference in the system were assessed qualitatively. In-bore positioning error was evaluated on 25 trajectories.  Results:   Open-air mean positioning error at the needle tip was 0.80 ± 0.36 mm with a one-sided 95% confidence interval of 1.40 mm. The mean deviation of needle trajectories from the planned direction was 0.14 ± 0.06∘ . In the MR bore, the mean positioning error at the needle tip was 2.11 ± 1.05 mm with a one-sided 95% prediction interval of 3.84 mm. The mean angular error was 0.49 ± 0.26∘ . The system was found to be compatible with the MR environment under the specified gradient-echo sequence parameters used in this study.  Conclusion:   A complete system for delivering needles to localized prostate tumors was developed and described in this work, and its compatibility with the MR environment was demonstrated. In-bore MRI positioning error was sufficiently small for targeting small localized prostate tumors.""","""['Eric Knull', 'Jeffrey Scott Bax', 'Claire Keun Sun Park', 'David Tessier', 'Aaron Fenster']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Toward mechatronic MRI-guided focal laser ablation of the prostate: Robust registration for improved needle delivery.', 'A system for MRI-guided transperineal delivery of needles to the prostate for focal therapy.', 'Evaluation of tumor coverage after MR-guided prostate focal laser ablation therapy.', 'Targeted prostate biopsy and MR-guided therapy for prostate cancer.', 'MR-Guided Prostate Interventions.', 'HoloLens augmented reality system for transperineal free-hand prostate procedures.']"""

By performing single cell transcriptomic analysis of human prostate cancer resident macrophages, three distinct populations were identified in the diseased prostate. Unexpectedly, no differences were observed between macrophages isolated from the tumorous and nontumorous portions of the prostatectomy specimens. Markers associated with canonical M1 and M2 macrophage phenotypes were identifiable, however these were not the main factors defining unique subtypes. The genes selectively associated with each macrophage cluster were used to develop a gene signature which was highly associated with both recurrence-free and metastasis-free survival. These results highlight the relevance of tissue-specific macrophage subtypes in the tumor microenvironment for prostate cancer progression and demonstrates the utility of profiling single-cell transcriptomics in human tumor samples as a strategy to design gene classifiers for patient prognostication. IMPLICATIONS: The specific macrophage subtypes present in a diseased human prostate have prognostic value, suggesting that the relative proportions of these populations are related to patient outcome.

Despite its prevalence, there is a critical knowledge gap in understanding factors driving disparities in survival among different cohorts of patients with prostate cancer. Identifying molecular features separating disparate populations is an important first step in prostate cancer research that could lead to fundamental hypotheses in prostate biology, predictive biomarker discovery, and personalized therapy. N-linked glycosylation is a cotranslational event during protein folding that modulates a myriad of cellular processes. Recently, aberrant N-linked glycosylation has been reported in prostate cancers. However, the full clinical implications of dysregulated glycosylation in prostate cancer has yet to be explored. Herein, we performed direct on-tissue analysis of N-linked glycans using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) from tissue microarrays of over 100 patient tumors with over 10 years of follow-up metadata. We successfully identified a panel of N-glycans that are unique between benign and prostate tumor tissue. Specifically, high-mannose as well as tri-and tetra-antennary N-glycans were more abundant in tumor tissue and increase proportionally with tumor grade. Further, we expanded our analyses to examine the N-glycan profiles of Black and Appalachian patients and have identified unique glycan signatures that correlate with recurrence in each population. Our study highlights the potential applications of MALDI-MSI for digital pathology and biomarker discovery for prostate cancer. IMPLICATIONS: MALDI-MSI identifies N-glycan perturbations in prostate tumors compared with benign tissue.

Host proteases are also involved in innate immunity and inflammation. Here, we report that the transmembrane protease hepsin (also known as TMPRSS1), which is predominantly present in hepatocytes, inhibited the induction of type I IFN during viral infections. Knocking out hepsin in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) increased the viral infection-induced expression of Ifnb1, an Ifnb1 promoter reporter, and an IFN-sensitive response element promoter reporter. Ectopic expression of hepsin in cultured human hepatocytes and HEK293T cells suppressed the induction of IFNβ during viral infections by reducing the abundance of STING. These effects depended on the protease activity of hepsin. We identified a putative hepsin target site in STING and showed that mutating this site protected STING from hepsin-mediated cleavage. In addition to hepatocytes, several hepsin-producing prostate cancer cell lines showed reduced STING-mediated type I IFN induction and responses. These results reveal a role for hepsin in suppressing STING-mediated type I IFN induction, which may contribute to the vulnerability of hepatocytes to chronic viral infections.""","""['Fu Hsin', 'Yu-Chen Hsu', 'Yu-Fei Tsai', 'Shu-Wha Lin', 'Helene Minyi Liu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Sci Signal""","""['Hepatitis C virus NS4B protein targets STING and abrogates RIG-I-mediated type I interferon-dependent innate immunity.', 'AMP-activated Kinase (AMPK) Promotes Innate Immunity and Antiviral Defense through Modulation of Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) Signaling.', 'Hepatitis B virus polymerase disrupts K63-linked ubiquitination of STING to block innate cytosolic DNA-sensing pathways.', 'Hepsin: a multifunctional transmembrane serine protease in pathobiology.', 'No Longer A One-Trick Pony: STING Signaling Activity Beyond Interferon.', 'Type II Transmembrane Serine Proteases as Modulators in Adipose Tissue Phenotype and Function.', 'Liver in infections: a single-cell and spatial transcriptomics perspective.', 'Clinical Significance of Hepsin and Underlying Signaling Pathways in Prostate Cancer.', 'The POR rs10954732 polymorphism decreases susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma and hepsin as a prognostic biomarker correlated with immune infiltration based on proteomics.']"""

Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify covariates associated with pN+ disease. Cox proportional hazards modeling and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to evaluate survival patients undergoing radical prostatectomy with or without pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND).  Results:   The rates of radical prostatectomy in men with grade group (GG) 4 and GG5 increased from 47.6% to 53.1% and from 42.5% to 49.5%, respectively. The annual rate increased from 2.02% in 2010 to 5.12% in 2017 (P < .001). The annual rates of PLND increased from 54.3% to 71.7%.

There is limited data assessing the efficacy and tolerability of abiraterone acetate (AA) versus enzalutamide in this population.  Objective:   To compare the clinical efficacy and tolerability of AA versus enzalutamide in patients ≥ 80 years with mCRPC.  Design, setting and participants:   A retrospective propensity-weighted comparative cohort study of first-line AA versus enzalutamide among patients with mCRPC aged ≥80 years.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Inverse probability treatment weights based on propensity scores were generated to assess the treatment effect of AA versus enzalutamide on time to PSA progression (TTPP), time to progression (TTP) (first of PSA/radiographic/clinical progression) and overall survival using a weighted Cox proportional hazards model. PSA response rate (PSA RR) was compared between groups using Χ2.  Results and limitations:   One hundred fifty-three patients received AA, and 125 received enzalutamide. Enzalutamide was associated with higher PSA RR (61.6% vs 43.8%, P < 0.004), and TTP (hazard ratio [HR] 0.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.50-0.88, P = 0.01) but not TTPP (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53-1.01, P = 0.06). There were significantly more dose reductions with enzalutamide (22.9% vs 44.8%, P > 0.001) but there was no interaction between median proportion of full dose received and TTPP or TTP for either drug. Rates of treatment discontinuation (for reasons other than progression) were also significantly different between AA and enzalutamide (28.8% vs 40.8%, respectively, P = 0.04). The most common reason for dose reductions and discontinuation of enzalutamide was fatigue (30.4% and 5.6%, respectively).  Conclusions:   Despite more dose reductions and a higher treatment discontinuation rate, enzalutamide was associated with a higher PSA RR and longer time to progression, than AA.

Biological prognostic markers of outcomes and predictors of chemotherapy benefit are undefined.  Patients and methods:   Whole transcriptomic profiling was performed on primary PC tissue obtained from patients enrolled in CHAARTED prior to systemic therapy. We adopted an a priori analytical plan to test defined RNA signatures and their associations with HSPC clinical phenotypes and outcomes. Multivariable analyses (MVAs) were adjusted for age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status, de novo metastasis presentation, volume of disease, and treatment arm. The primary endpoint was OS; the secondary endpoint was time to castration-resistant PC.  Results:   The analytic cohort of 160 patients demonstrated marked differences in transcriptional profile compared with localized PC, with a predominance of luminal B (50%) and basal (48%) subtypes, lower androgen receptor activity (AR-A), and high Decipher risk disease. Luminal B subtype was associated with poorer prognosis on ADT alone but benefited significantly from ADT + D [OS: hazard ratio (HR) 0.45; P = 0.007], in contrast to basal subtype which showed no OS benefit (HR 0.85; P = 0.58), even in those with high-volume disease.

Aim:   To estimate cancer incidence in Libya and draw trends of cancer type distribution compared to regional and worldwide data. Such incidence data are needed to inform strategic decisions on cancer facilities, training, and research in the given geographical area of Misurata, the major city in the middle region and third largest in Libya.  Methods:   This is an observational, multi-centre, city-wide study to account for all cancer cases. All radiology (computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) and pathology reports were examined across all public and private hospitals in and around Misurata.  Results:   Four hundred and thirty cancer cases were identified to have been diagnosed during 12 months (July 2019-June 2020), yielding a cancer incidence of 71.7 per 100 000 population. Breast cancer (84, 19.5%), colorectal cancer (83, 19.3%), lung cancer (33, 7.7%), and prostate cancer (21, 4.9%) had the highest prevalence.  Conclusion:   Cancer incidence established in this study stands at 71.1, much lower than the worldwide reported incidence of 201.0. Several limitations lead to missing cancer cases from the survey period, mostly related to poor documentation, non-research friendly environment, and disorganised healthcare structure.

SDM is especially important for African American men, who are at high risk for the disease.  Objective:   To evaluate agreement in SDM ratings among patients, providers, and objective observers.  Method:   African American men ages 45-70 were recruited from primary care practices to participate in a study evaluating a decision aid (DA). Immediately after using the DA, patients proceeded to primary care appointments. Afterwards, patients and physicians completed surveys assessing perceptions about SDM. Clinical visits were also audio-recorded and coded to assess SDM.  Results:   Mean scores on SDM measures among patients were 73.2 (SD = 27.5, 95% CI 55.71-90.62), 83.1 among physicians (SD = 7.8 95% CI 78.14-88.06), and 67.1 among objective raters (SD = 36.8 95% CI 43.72-90.45). Among patient-provider dyads, mean agreement was 49.9%.  Conclusion:   Patients, physicians, and objective observers perceived SDM differently. Understanding discordant experiences of SDM is vital for improving clinical guidance about SDM especially among African Americans who have historically faced healthcare discrimination and mistrust. DAs, particularly for African American men, should incorporate strategies to empower patients to advocate for their communication needs and preferences.

Objective:   To assess whether dynamic prediction models aid prognosis of radiographic progression risk, using ongoing longitudinal prostate-specific antigen (PSA) assessments.  Design, setting, and participants:   This prognostic study used data from the PREVAIL study to compare dynamic models for predicting disease progression. The PREVAIL study was a phase 3, multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of enzalutamide for prostate cancer conducted from September 2010 to September 2012. A total of 773 men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) who had never received chemotherapy and had no baseline visceral disease were treated with enzalutamide. For illustration, 4 patients were selected based on PSA kinetics or PSA response in case studies. Data were analyzed from July 2018 to September 2019.  Main outcomes and measures:   Landmark and joint models were applied to dynamically predict radiographic progression-free survival (PFS) using longitudinal PSA profile, baseline PSA, lactate dehydrogenase, and hemoglobin levels. The main outcome was radiographic PFS as predicted using landmark and joint models. Current PSA and PSA change were considered longitudinal biomarkers possibly associated with radiographic PFS. Predictive performance was evaluated using Brier score for overall prediction errors (PEs) and area under the curve (AUC) for model discriminative capability. Case studies were illustrated using dynamic prediction plots.  Results:   A total of 763 men with metastatic CRPC treated with enzalutamide (mean [SD] age, 71.2 [8.5] years; mean [SD] body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared], 28.4 [4.6]) were included in the analysis. Current PSA and PSA change were associated with radiographic PFS in all models. Adding the PSA slope, compared with the landmark models using current PSA alone, improved the prediction of 5-month prospect of radiographic progression, with relative gains of 5.7% in prediction (PE [SE], 0.132 [0.008] vs 0.140 [0.008]) and 7.7% in discrimination (AUC [SE], 0.800 [0.018] vs 0.743 [0.018]) at month 10. In joint models with linear vs nonlinear PSA, prediction of 5-month risk of radiographic progression was improved when PSA trajectories were not assumed to be linear, with 8.0% relative gain in prediction (PE [SE], 0.150 [0.006] vs 0.138 [0.005]) and 19.4% relative gain in discrimination (AUC [SE], 0.653 [0.022] vs 0.780 [0.016]) at month 10.

As a result, the number of electronic pathology reports (EPRs) submitted to NJSCR increased markedly from 2015 to 2017. EPRs are more likely to contain incomplete or missing race than North American Association of Central Cancer Registry (NAACCR) abstracts from hospitals and physician offices. NJSCR staff conduct follow-back for additional information for laboratory-only cases, but response rates are poor, the process is lengthy, and laboratory reports often do not include physician information.  Purpose:   To assess the impact of increased EPR on the quality of race data.  Methods:   NJSCR data sets created 24 months after the end of the diagnosis year-with data that were more than 98% complete-were used to calculate the percent of EPR-only cases by primary site and the percent of cases with unknown race. We calculated the relative risk of unknown race by site, compared to all sites, and used Spearman's ρ to assess the correlation between EPR-only cases and unknown race.  Results:   While the percent of cases with unknown race was within the standards for NAACCR Gold Certification (3%), it varied by cancer site. Sites less likely to be reported by hospitals had higher rates of unknown race in the 24-month data set: prostate, leukemia, melanoma, bladder. After follow-back and death clearance activities, ≥36 months after the diagnosis year, the percent of cases with unknown race is reduced, although the impact varies by cancer site.  Conclusion:   Race-specific incidence rates for certain cancer types may be artificially depressed in the 24-month data set due to the unavailability of race for the increasing number of laboratory-only cases. While follow-back activities help to improve the collection of race data over time, these new values are not available until a revised data set is released. The higher proportion of unknown or other race in the 24-month data set impacts the accuracy of reporting the burden and trends of cancer by race. In addition, cases with unknown race may be ineligible for inclusion in cancer surveillance research studies.""","""['Stephanie M Hill', 'Jie Li', 'Karen Pawlish', 'Lisa E Paddock', 'Antoinette M Stroup']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Registry Manag""","""['An Innovative Approach to Improve Completeness of Treatment and Other Key Data Elements in a Population-Based Cancer Registry: A15-Month Data Submission.', 'A new method to evaluate the completeness of case ascertainment by a cancer registry.', 'Italian cancer figures, report 2012: Cancer in children and adolescents.', 'Screening for Skin Cancer in Adults: An Updated Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Volume and health outcomes: evidence from systematic reviews and from evaluation of Italian hospital data.']"""

Methods:   Age-adjusted incidence rates for all invasive cancers were calculated for South Asian (Indian, Pakistani), Chinese, and Vietnamese cancer cases reported to the Massachusetts Cancer Registry (MCR). Additionally, rates were calculated for the most frequent cancers among non-Hispanic Asians (prostate, colorectal, female breast, female thyroid, lung, and male liver). The 95% confidence intervals were calculated to determine statistical significance between the rates.  Results:   South Asian and Vietnamese females had significantly elevated rates of all invasive cancers compared to Chinese females, while Chinese and South Asian females had a significantly elevated breast cancer rate. Vietnamese males had a significantly elevated rate of all invasive cancers, liver cancer, and lung cancer compared to the other 2 groups. Due to the high rates of lung cancer among Vietnamese males, MCR current/previous smoking data were compared for all cancers. Among Vietnamese, Chinese, and South Asian male cancer cases, current/ previous smoking percentages were 64%, 51%, and 35%, respectively.  Conclusions:   Our analyses showed a significant difference of rates for several cancers by specific Asian ethnicity within the broader Asian, non-Hispanic race category.

Disparities in cancer survival (for instance, by neighborhood-level income) persist in Ontario, Canada despite the existence of a universal health care system. Lower income has been associated with an increased incidence of cancer and worsened survival.  Purpose:   This project aims to analyze and report on relative survival to provide a mechanism for understanding the level of equity within Ontario's cancer care system.  Methods:   Age-standardized relative survival ratios (ARSRs) by cancer type and age group were estimated for 229,934 Ontario adults aged 15-99 years diagnosed between 2006 and 2011 with 1 of 9 cancer types (stomach, colorectal, liver, lung, breast, cervical, ovarian, prostate, and leukemia) using a complete survival analysis. Using the Pohar-Perme estimator, the 1-, 3- and 5-year ARSRs with 95% confidence intervals were calculated by patients' neighborhood-level income quintile. Estimates were age-standardized using the International Cancer Survival Standard weights.  Results:   Fifty-four relative survival trend curves were developed covering 9 cancers by neighborhood-level income for Ontarians in 5 different age groups and all age groups combined. Disparities in cancer survival were observed between income groups and across age groups and different cancer types in Ontario. For most cancer types and age groups, survival was higher in higher income groups, but this trend was not consistently observed in adolescents and young adults aged 15-44 years.  Conclusions:   Disparities in cancer survival persist in Ontario across income groups. Relative survival was significantly higher for higher (Q4 or Q5) compared to lower (Q1 or Q2) neighborhood-level income populations for most cancer types and age groups. Adolescents and young adults with cancer are a small and unique group of patients in terms of the biology of their cancers and their cancer journey, thereby making the patterns of survival disparities observed in this age group more complicated to interpret. Further examination of factors contributing to these disparities is crucial to eliminate survival disparities, reduce premature deaths, and improve cancer survival in Ontario.""","""['Ying Wang', 'Naomi Schwartz', 'Stephanie Young', 'Julie Klein-Geltink', 'Rebecca Truscott']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Registry Manag""","""[""Associations among socioeconomic status, patterns of care and outcomes in breast cancer patients in a universal health care system: Ontario's experience."", 'Progress in cancer survival, mortality, and incidence in seven high-income countries 1995-2014 (ICBP SURVMARK-2): a population-based study.', 'Incidence of breast and colorectal cancer among immigrants in Ontario, Canada: a retrospective cohort study from 2004-2014.', 'Early-Onset Cancers in Adults: A Review of Epidemiology, Supportive Care Needs and Future Research Priorities.', 'The distinctive biology of cancer in adolescents and young adults.', 'Population-Based Cancer Survival in Canada and the United States by Socioeconomic Status: Findings from the CONCORD-2 Study.', 'Effect of Differences in Access to Screening, Healthcare, and Treatment on Cancer Disparities.']"""

However, it is not fully known how immune infiltration affects the development of PRAD and its clinical presentation.  Methods:   Herein, we investigated the immune infiltration phenotypes in PRAD based on transcriptome profiles, methylation profiles, somatic mutation, and copy number variations. We also developed an immune prognostic model (IPM) to identify unfavorable prognosis. To verify this model, immunohistochemistry staining was performed on a cohort of PRAD samples. Moreover, we constructed a nomogram to assess the survival of PRAD incorporating immune infiltration and other clinical features.  Results:   We categorized PRAD patients into high and low-level clusters based on immune infiltration phenotypes. The patients in the high-level clusters had worse survival than their low-level counterparts. Gene set enrichment analysis indicated that both anti- and pro-tumor terms were enriched in high-level cluster. Moreover, we identified a positive correlation between anti- and pro-tumor immune cells in PRAD microenvironment. Notably, Somatic mutation analysis showed patients in high-level cluster had a higher somatic mutation burden of KMT2D, HSPA8, CHD7, and MAP1A. In addition, we developed an IPM with robust predictive ability. The model can distinguish high-risk PRAD patients with poor prognosis from low-risk PRAD patients in both training and another three independent validation datasets. Besides, we constructed a nomogram incorporating Gleason score, pathological T stage, and IPM for the prognosis prediction of PRAD patients, which displayed robust predictive ability and might contribute to clinical practice.

Most cases of death from PCa are due to metastasis. Early stages of metastasis are mediated by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process through which cancer cells acquire motility and invasive characteristics. Thus, more potent and novel therapeutic strategies must be designed based on the inhibition of EMT or metastasis. Herein, we employ a co-culture system to evaluate the anti-EMT effects of human amniotic mesenchymal stromal cells (hAMSCs) on LNCaP PCa cells. The RNA of treated (sample) and untreated cancer cells (control) and whole-cell lysates of related cells were prepared and analysed through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot, respectively. Based on the results, the expression of vimentin, Snail and Zeb1 in LNCaP cells decreased and the expression of E-cadherin increased after treatment with hAMSCs. Furthermore, induction of the cellular apoptosis in LNCaP cells was detected. The anti-cancer activity of conditioned medium from hAMSCs was shown using hanging drop technique (a 3D cell culture model). Our findings support the idea that stem cells can be considered as a novel therapeutic approach to inhibit prostate cancer cells. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: The anti-tumour activity of hAMSCs on LNCaP prostate cancer cells using 2D and 3D cell culture models via induction of apoptosis, suppression of EMT process and down-regulation of EGFR was shown.

Here we found targeting androgens/AR with either the recently developed antiandrogen Enzalutamide (Enz) or AR-shRNAs led to increase PCa cell invasion, yet decrease BCa cell invasion. Mechanistic dissection revealed that suppressing androgens/AR signals could result in differential alterations of the selective circular RNAs (circRNAs) as a result of differential endogenous AR transcription. A negative autoregulation in PCa, yet a positive autoregulation in BCa, as a result of differential binding of AR to different androgen-response elements (AREs) and a discriminating histone H3K4 methylation, likely contributes to this outcome between these two urological tumors. Further mechanistic studies indicated that AR-encoded circRNA-ARC1 might sponge/alter the availability of the miRNAs miR-125b-2-3p and/or miR-4736, to impact the metastasis-related PPARγ/MMP-9 signals to alter the PCa vs. BCa cell invasion.

The model consists of 46 SNPs identified in Europeans and 3 SNPs from 8q24 shown to improve model performance in Africans. Herein, we used principal component (PC) analysis to uncover subpopulations of men with African ancestry for whom the utility of PHS46+African may differ.  Materials and methods:   Genotypic data were obtained from the PRACTICAL consortium for 6253 men with African genetic ancestry. Genetic variation in a window spanning 3 African-specific 8q24 SNPs was estimated using 93 PCs. A Cox proportional hazards framework was used to identify the pair of PCs most strongly associated with the performance of PHS46+African. A calibration factor (CF) was formulated using Cox coefficients to quantify the extent to which the performance of PHS46+African varies with PC.  Results:   CF of PHS46+African was strongly associated with the first and twentieth PCs. Predicted CF ranged from 0.41 to 2.94, suggesting that PHS46+African may be up to 7 times more beneficial to some African men than others. The explained relative risk for PHS46+African varied from 3.6% to 9.9% for individuals with low and high CF values, respectively. By cross-referencing our data set with 1000 Genomes, we identified significant associations between continental and calibration groupings.  Conclusion:   We identified PCs within 8q24 that were strongly associated with the performance of PHS46+African.

Enzalutamide is the second-generation inhibitor of androgen receptor signaling and is the fundamental drug for the treatment of advanced PCa. However, the disease will eventually progress to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and aggressive neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) because of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) resistance. The aim of the study was to investigate the role of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) AFAP1-AS1 in ADT resistance.  Methods:   Quantitative real-time PCR analysis (qPCR) was used to assess the expression of AFAP1-AS1 in PCa cell lines and tissues. Cell proliferation and invasion were assessed after AFAP1-AS1 knockdown using Cell Counting Kit (CCK)-8 and Transwell assay, respectively. A dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was carried out to validate the regulatory relationship among AFAP1-AS1, microRNA (miR)-15b, and insulin-like growth factor1 receptor (IGF1R).  Results:   AFAP1-AS1 level was markedly increased in castration-resistant C4-2 cells and NE-like cells (PC3, DU145, and NCI-H660), compared with androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells. Enzalutamide treatment increased the expression of AFAP1-AS1 in vitro and in vivo. Functionally, AFAP1-AS1 knockdown repressed tumor cell proliferation and invasion. Mechanistically, AFAP1-AS1 functioned as an oncogene in PCa through binding to miR-15b and destroying its tumor suppressor function. Finally, we identified that AFAP1-AS1 up-regulated IGF1R expression by competitively binding to miR-15b to de-repress IGF1R.  Conclusion:   AFAP1-AS1 facilitates PCa progression by regulating miR-15b/IGF1R axis, indicating that AFAP1-AS1 may serve as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for PCa.""","""['Bo Liu', 'Hui-Yang Jiang', 'Tao Yuan', 'Wei-Dong Zhou', 'Zhen-Dong Xiang', 'Qi-Quan Jiang', 'Deng-Long Wu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Curr Pharm Des""","""['The long coding RNA AFAP1-AS1 promotes tumor cell growth and invasion in pancreatic cancer through upregulating the IGF1R oncogene via sequestration of miR-133a.', 'Long non-coding RNA AFAP1-AS1 promotes proliferation and invasion in prostate cancer via targeting miR-512-3p.', 'Long non-coding RNA AFAP1-AS1 facilitates ovarian cancer progression by regulating the miR-107/PDK4 axis.', 'The role of long non-coding RNA AFAP1-AS1 in human malignant tumors.', 'Preclinical Models of Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'Emerging RNA-Based Therapeutic and Diagnostic Options: Recent Advances and Future Challenges in Genitourinary Cancers.', 'LINC00893 inhibits the progression of prostate cancer through miR-3173-5p/SOCS3/JAK2/STAT3 pathway.', 'The Crosstalk of Long Non-Coding RNA and MicroRNA in Castration-Resistant and Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer: Their Interaction and Clinical Importance.']"""

This study investigated the underlying mechanism of the anti-prostate cancer effects of helenalin in vitro. MATERIAL AND METHODS CCK-8 assay was performed to detect the optimal concentrations of helenalin in DU145 and PC-3 cells. After exposure to helenalin and/or reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibitor, ROS production was assessed by DCFH-DA staining. Thioredoxin reductase-1 (TrxR1) expression was detected by RT-qPCR and western blot. Moreover, apoptosis and cell cycle were evaluated by flow cytometry. Following TrxR1 knockdown or overexpression, TrxR1 expression, ROS generation, apoptosis, cell cycle, migration, and invasion were examined in cells co-treated with helenalin. RESULTS Helenalin distinctly repressed the viability of prostate cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner. We chose 8 μM and 4 μM as the optimal concentrations of helenalin for DU145 and PC-3 cells, respectively. Helenalin treatment markedly triggered ROS production and lowered TrxR1 expression, which was ameliorated by ROS inhibitor. Exposure to helenalin facilitated apoptosis as well as G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, which was reversed by ROS inhibitor. Helenalin relieved the inhibitory effect of TrxR1 on ROS production. Furthermore, helenalin ameliorated the decrease in apoptosis rate and the shortening of G0/G1 phase as well as the increase in migration and invasion induced by TrxR1 overexpression.

If known, the impact of potentially larger bladder necks on continence and chronic obstruction on postoperative urinary symptoms might aid patient counseling. We assessed the impact of intraoperatively identified median lobes (ML) on urinary function.  Methods:   We reviewed our prospective RP database from 2013 to 2020. AUA symptoms scores (AUA-SS) were assessed preoperatively and at 1, 3, and 6 months. We compared patients with and without ML (NoML). Bladder-neck sparing was routine to avoid reconstruction.  Results:   Of 663 patients who completed AUA-SS questionnaires at all time points, 202 (30%) had ML. There were no significant differences in demographics, PSA, or clinical stage. Only two patients in ML and one in NoML group required bladder-neck reconstruction (1.2% and 0.2%). There was no immediate or long-term difference in continence rates between groups. Baseline mean AUA-SS was higher in ML patients and showed more improvement postoperatively (-5.5 vs. -3.6, p < .05) with greatest improvement in ML patients with severe preoperative symptoms (-15.1). There was no difference in AUA-SS between groups by 6 months.  Conclusions:   The presence of enlarged ML does not increase the risk of incontinence after RARP and it appears that ML patients have greater improvements in postsurgical urinary functions.

There are two approaches for obtaining dynamic predictions: (1) a joint model of the longitudinal marker and survival process, and (2) an approximate approach that specifies a model for a specific component of the joint distribution. In the case of a binary marker, an illness-death model is an example of a joint modeling approach that is unified and produces consistent predictions. However, previous literature has shown that approximate approaches, such as landmarking, with additional flexibility can have good predictive performance. One such approach proposes using a Gaussian copula to model the joint distribution of conditional continuous marker and survival distributions. It has the advantage of specifying established, flexible models for the marginals for which goodness-of-fit can be assessed, and has easy estimation that can be implemented in standard software. In this article, we provide a Gaussian copula approach for dynamic prediction to accommodate a binary marker using a continuous latent variable formulation.

The purpose of this study was to identify protein biomarkers altered by chronic prostatitis. To perform the study, we chemically induced chronic prostate inflammation in Sprague Dawley rats using estradiol benzoate (EB), testosterone (T), and estradiol (E) and then examined protein levels in their plasma. Plasma was collected on postnatal days (PNDs) 90, 100, 145, and 200; plasma proteins were profiled using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Chronic inflammation was observed in the rat prostate induced with EB on PNDs 1, 3, and 5. Rats then were dosed with T+E during PNDs 90-200 via subcutaneous implants. We identified time-specific expression for several proteins (i.e., CFB, MYH9, AZGP1). Some altered proteins that were expressed in the prostate (i.e., SERPINF1, CTR9) also were identified in the rat plasma in the EB+T+E group on PNDs 145 and 200.

We applied the biclustering method MCbiclust to explore large biclusters in the TCGA cohort through a large number of iterations. Two biclusters were found with the highest silhouette coefficient value. The expression patterns of one bicluster are highly similar to those found by the gene expression profile of the known androgen-regulated genes. Further gene set enrichment revealed that mitochondrial function-related genes were negatively correlated with AR regulation-related genes. Then, we performed differential analysis, AR binding site analysis, and survival analysis on the core genes with high phenotypic contribution. Among the core genes, NDUFA10 showed a low expression value in cancer patients across different expression profiles, while NDUFV2 showed a high expression value in cancer patients. Survival analysis of NDUFA10 and NDUFV2 demonstrated that both genes were unfavorable prognostic markers.""","""['Haokun Zhang', 'Yuanhua Shao', 'Weijun Chen', 'Xin Chen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Biomed Res Int""","""['A TMEFF2-regulated cell cycle derived gene signature is prognostic of recurrence risk in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen-regulated genes differentially modulated by the androgen receptor coactivator L-dopa decarboxylase in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Gene Expression Studies to Identify Significant Genes in AR, MTOR, MAPK Pathways and their Overlapping Regulatory Role in Prostate Cancer.', 'Involvement of the multiple tumor suppressor genes and 12-lipoxygenase in human prostate cancer.

Differences in PCa incidence around the world can be partly explained by variations in recommendations for prostate-specific antigen (PSA), particularly for early detection. For example, the PSA testing policy is more conservative in the Netherlands than in Germany. To better understand the relationship between PSA testing recommendations and PCa incidence, stage distribution, and mortality, we compared these variables over time between Lower Saxony in northwestern Germany and the neighboring province of Groningen in the Netherlands.  Methods:   Population data, tumor stage- and age group-specific PCa incidence (ICD-10 C61) and mortality rates for Lower Saxony and Groningen were obtained from the Lower Saxony Epidemiological Cancer Registry, the Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organization, and Statistics Netherlands for 2003-2012. Incidence and mortality rates per 100,000 person-years were age-standardized (ASR, old European standard). Trends in age-standardized incidence rates (ASIR) and mortality rates (ASMR) for specific age groups were assessed using joinpoint regression.  Results:   The mean annual PCa ASIR between 2003 and 2012 was on average 19.9% higher in Lower Saxony than in Groningen (120.5 vs. 100.5 per 100,000), while the mean annual ASMR was on average 24.3% lower in Lower Saxony than in Groningen (21.5 vs. 28.4 per 100,000). Between 2003 and 2012, the average annual percentage change (AAPC) in PCa incidence rates did not change significantly in either Lower Saxony (-1.8%, 95% CI -3.5, 0.0) or Groningen (0.2%, 95% CI -5.0, 5.7). In contrast, the AAPC in mortality rate decreased significantly during the same time period in Lower Saxony (-2.5%, 95% CI -3.0, -2.0) but not in Groningen (0.1%, 95% CI -2.4, 2.6).  Conclusions:   Higher PCa incidence and lower PCa-related mortality was detected in Lower Saxony than in Groningen. Although recommendations on PSA testing may play a role, the assessed data could not offer obvious explanations to the observed differences. Therefore, further investigations including data on the actual use of PSA testing, other influences (e.g., dietary and ethnic factors), and better data quality are needed to explain differences between the regions.""","""['Sanny Kappen', 'Geertruida H de Bock', 'Eunice Sirri', 'Claudia Vohmann', 'Joachim Kieschke', 'Alexander Winter']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""['Penile cancer - Incidence, mortality, and survival in Saxony, Germany.', 'Attitudes Toward and Use of Prostate-Specific Antigen Testing Among Urologists and General Practitioners in Germany: A Survey.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Global Trends and Prostate Cancer: A Review of Incidence, Detection, and Mortality as Influenced by Race, Ethnicity, and Geographic Location.', 'FOXO3a and Its Regulators in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Results:   FCX inhibited proliferation of prostate cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner with more selectivity toward LNCaP cells. Nuclear fragmentation and dose-dependent increase in Annexin V-positive LNCaP cells revealed apoptosis. Cell cycle G2/M phase arrest along with sub-G0/G1 population augmented the antiproliferative observations. Addition of FCX in the presence of estradiol, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone, LNCaP cells markedly caused a dose-dependent increase in cell proliferation indicating the compound activity to be facilitated through androgen receptor pathway.

Materials and methods:   ZnO nanoparticles were prepared by the solvothermal method and 10% bovine serum albumin was used as the dispersant. The cytotoxic effect of DOX alone and in combination with different concentrations of ZnO nanofluids (0.95-15.6 μg/ml) in the presence and absence of UVA irradiation on DU145 cells was evaluated by -(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay.

We sought to evaluate the treatment outcomes of adding docetaxel or abiraterone to ADT in Indian population.  Methods:   We reviewed the medical records of ninety patients with newly diagnosed mHSPC who received treatment between January 2015 and June 2018. Patients received ADT alone or ADT + docetaxel or ADT + abiraterone as initial treatment. Monthly clinical evaluation and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurement were done. Outcome measures analyzed included PSA decline <90%, serological complete response (sCR) (PSA < 0.2 ng/ml), and progression to CRPC. Outcome variable was compared using Fisher's exact test.  Results:   Patients received ADT alone (n = 37) or ADT + docetaxel (n = 31) or ADT + abiraterone (n = 22). The median age was 67.5 years (range, 41-87 years) and the median PSA was 88.5 ng/ml (range, 1.12-4000). PSA decline <90% was seen in 22 (73%), 24 (86%), and 17 (94%) patients in the ADT alone, ADT + docetaxel, and ADT + abiraterone groups. sCR was achieved in 5 (17%), 10 (36%), and 9 (50%) patients in the ADT alone, ADT + docetaxel, and ADT + abiraterone groups.

This study evaluates the ability of the RR in RW dose reduction, in particular reduction of the RW V70Gy≥ 25% in comparison with the plan without RR dose-volume histograms were generated with and without RR. The patient's tolerance was assessed by patient-reported outcomes.  Results:   The planning target volume coverage was equal for both without and with RR (P = 0.155). The mean dose to the RW was statistically significantly lower for the plan with RR than that for the plan without RR, a mean reduction of 5.8 Gy (P = 0.003).

Of the total study sample, the facial expressions of 38 patients (35%) corresponded to level 0 in the study, seven (15%) to level 2, and a single patient (2%) to level 4. None of the facial expressions of the patients corresponded to levels 6, 8, or 10. The evaluation of procedure-related genitourinary and gastrointestinal system side effects indicated that nine patients (20%) experienced side effects, while no side effects were reported in 37 patients (80%). The reported side effects included rectal bleeding in two patients (4%), dysuria in three patients (6%), hematuria in five patients (11%), and frequent urination in five patients (11%). None of the patients experienced fever or hematospermia. All side effects were reported by the respondents as ""a little,"" while only one patient answered positively to the question on the frequency of urination. Among the patients who answered ""yes"" and ""a little"" to the questions evaluating genitourinary and gastrointestinal system side effects, the severity of these events was reported as Grade 1, corresponding to mild adverse, in only 9 (20%) patients. None of the patients experienced a Grade 2 or higher severe adverse event. In the comparison of the severity of pain of the patients during the fiducial marker procedure without local anesthesia with the severity of pain during the biopsy, 24 patients (80%) reported ""lower"" levels of pain, while five patients (20%) reported ""equal"" levels of pain. None of the patients stated that they had experienced ""more"" pain.  Conclusion:   IGRT accompanied by an ultrasound-guided implantation of fiducial markers without local anesthesia can be considered a safe method, given the associated acceptable levels of pain, low side effect profiles, and high prostate-specific antigen control rates.""","""['Cenk Ahmet Sen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Ther""","""['Transperineal gold marker implantation for image-guided external beam radiotherapy of prostate cancer : A single institution, prospective study.', 'Patient-reported complications from fiducial marker implantation for prostate image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Fiducial marker implantation in prostate radiation therapy: complication rates and technique.', 'Safety and morbidity of first and repeat transrectal ultrasound guided prostate needle biopsies: results of a prospective European prostate cancer detection study.', 'Fiducial markers and spacers in prostate radiotherapy: current applications.', ""Mathematical model and artificial intelligence for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.""]"""

The present study investigates the α-emitter radiopharmaceuticals absorbed dose distribution in the body organs.  Materials and methods:   The α-emitter radiopharmaceuticals dose coefficient and absorbed doses biokinetics distribution, which are used for the treatment of PCa in all over the world, were performed using the ""Internal Dose Assessed by Computer"" (IDAC-Dose 2.1) program. The results of absorbed dose distribution in any organ of the body, were compared in studied α-emitter radiopharmaceuticals.  Results:   The absorbed dose value of 223Ra radiopharmaceutical in the prostate organ was evaluated 9.47E-9 Gy/Bq. The maximum and minimum absorbed doses due to biokinetics distribution of 223Ra were found in the thymus (9.53E-8 Gy/Bq) and eye lenses (1.30E-10 Gy/Bq) organs, respectively. Furthermore, the 225Ac absorbed dose in the prostate organ was obtained 1.91E-9 Gy/Bq, where this value is 1% of total body dose. While the absorbed dose distribution of 225Ac in body organs shows the highest concentration in the spleen (1.47E-8 Gy/Bq) and lowest in the eye lenses (7.93E-12 Gy/Bq).  Conclusion:   The absorbed dose in the body organs due to 223Ra and 225Ac α-emitter radiopharmaceuticals which are used in metastasized castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), calculated in this study.

Materials and methods:   The transrectal ultrasound (US)-guided procedure was used for permanent implant procedure. The Best® Sonalis™ US Imaging System and Best NOMOS™ Treatment Planning system was used for volume study and implant procedure. The BARC provided I-125 Ocu-Pro radioactive seeds were implanted into the patient with help of Mick@ Applicator. The implant was performed based on pre-implant dosimetry and intraoperative planning performed during implant procedure.  Results:   The necessary quality assurance tests were performed for US system before clinical use. The boost dose of 110 Gy was prescribed to the prostate volume of 34.71 cc. About 48 seeds with activity of 0.35 mCi (each) implanted into the prostate volume with reference to intraoperative planning. At the end of procedure, the patient underwent abdomen fluoroscopic examination, to ensure the seed counts in the prostate volume. The day after the implant, the patient was discharged. One month later a planning computed tomography and treatment planning was performed for seed position and dose verification.  Conclusions:   Low dose rate permanent implant brachytherapy has the advantage of being a one-time procedure and the existing long term follow-up supports its excellent outcome and low morbidity. BARC-BRIT is supplying the loose 125I seeds. These seeds can be easily implanted into the patient using Mick applicator. However, the pre-implant seed preparation and implant procedure may result some radiation exposure to staff involved. The radiation dose can be minimized with good practice.

Combination anticancer therapy using doxorubicin (DOX) and another extract of traditional Chinese medicine is one nano-sized drug delivery system promising to generate synergistic anticancer effects, maximize the treatment effect, and overcome multi-drug resistance. The purpose of this study is to construct a drug delivery system for the co-delivery of DOX and tanshinones (TAN). Lipid nanoparticles loaded with DOX and TAN (N-DOX/TAN) were prepared by emulsification and solvent-diffusion method. PSMA targeted nanoparticles loaded with DOX and TAN (P-N-DOX/TAN) were synthesized by conjugating a PSMA targeted ligand to N-DOX/TAN. We evaluate the performance of this system in vitro and in vivo. P-N-DOX/TAN has a size of 139.7 ± 4.1 nm and a zeta potential of 11.2 ± 1.6 mV. The drug release of DOX and TAN from P-N-DOX/TAN was much faster than that of N-DOX/TAN. N-DOX/TAN presented more inhibition effect on tumor growth than N-DOX and N-TAN, which is consistent with the synergistic results and successfully highlighting the advantages of combing the DOX and TAN in one system. P-N-DOX/TAN achieved higher uptake by LNCaP cells (58.9 ± 1.9%), highest tumor tissue distribution, and the most significant tumor inhibition efficiency.

Methods:   Louisiana residents who were diagnosed with localized prostate cancer (PCa) in 1996-2013 and received surgery or radiation were included. Patients were followed until SPBC diagnosis, death, or Dec. 2018. The exposure variable was type of treatment (radiation only vs. surgery only). The outcome was time from PCa diagnosis to SPBC diagnosis, stratified by race. Fine and Gray's competing risk model was applied with death as a competing event and adjustment of sociodemographic and tumor characteristics. We used 5 years and 10 years as lag time in the analyses.  Results:   A total of 26,277 PCa patients with a median follow-up of 10.7 years were analyzed, including 18,598 white and 7679 black patients. About 42.9 % of whites and 45.7 % of blacks received radiation. SPBC counted for 1.84 % in the radiation group and 0.90 % in the surgery group among white patients and for 0.91 % and 0.58 %, respectively, among black patients. The adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio of SPBC was 1.80 (95 % CI: 1.30-2.48) for radiation recipients compared to surgery recipients among white patients; 1.93 (95 % CI: 1.36-2.74) if restricted to external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). The SPBC risk was not significantly different between irradiated and surgically treated among blacks.  Conclusions:   The SPBC risk is almost two-fold among white irradiated PCa patients compared to their counterparts treated surgically.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening shows uncertain benefits and harms from clinical and economic perspectives, resulting in an important impact on healthcare systems. Because of nonstandardized studies and substantial differences among populations, data are still inconclusive.  Objective:   The objective of this study was to carry out long-term cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis on the PSA-screened population from the service provider's perspective in the Brazilian population.  Methods:   We performed a cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis using clinical outcomes obtained from 9692 men enrolled in the PSA screening program. Prostate cancer treatments, 5-year follow-up outcomes, and all related costs were examined. Data were compared with a nonscreened prostate cancer population to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR). ICER and ICUR were compared with the Brazilian-established willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold (WTP = R$ 114 026.55).  Results:   A total of 251 of 9692 men had a diagnosis of prostate cancer (2.6%), of which 90% had localized disease. Two hundred and five patients were treated as follows: surgery (45.37%); radiation therapy (11.22%); radiation plus androgen deprivation therapy (21.95%); active surveillance (13.17%); exclusive androgen deprivation therapy (7.32%); and watchful waiting (0.98%). Two simulated cohorts were compared based on screening and nonscreening groups. Values obtained were-ICER of R$ 44 491.39 per life saved and ICUR of R$ 10 851.56 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained-below the Brazilian WTP threshold and showed cost-effectiveness and cost-utility advantages.

Materials and methods:   Clinical trials of systemic therapy for incurable NSCLC from clinicaltrials.gov were reviewed to determine the frequency of exclusion on the basis of prior cancer. A cohort of patients with incurable NSCLC and prior cancer, treated with first-line systemic treatment at our institution were reviewed as a surrogate clinical trial population. A list of priori events was developed to capture the potential for prior cancer to negatively affect clinical trial conduct or endpoints. The proportions of patients that developed an outcome were assessed.  Results:   Among trials registered on clinicaltrials.gov, 66% listed prior cancer in the eligibility criteria, and of these 35% excluded patients with prior cancer in the last 5 years. Of NSCLC patients treated with systemic therapy at Princess Margaret Cancer Center, 20% had prior cancer, of these, breast (20%) and prostate (19%) were the most common malignancies. Median time between prior cancer and NSCLC was 82 months. Median survival was 20 months. For patients without evidence of active prior cancer at baseline, and not on active therapy for prior cancer, no patients had evidence of a recurrence of prior cancer during the treatment and follow-up for the NSCLC, nor died from prior cancer. However, two patients developed new primaries.

The retrospective observational study included men with de novo metastatic prostate cancer who were treated with primary androgen-deprivation therapy at 30 institutions across Japan between 2008 and 2017. We created a risk model for overall survival (OS) in the discovery cohort (n = 1449) stratified by the metastatic burden (low vs high) and validated its predictive ability in a separate cohort (n = 951). Based on multivariate analyses, lower hemoglobin levels, higher Gleason grades, and higher clinical T-stage were associated with poor OS in low-burden disease. Meanwhile, lower hemoglobin levels, higher Gleason grade group, liver metastasis, and higher extent of disease scores in bone were associated with poor OS in patients with high-burden disease. In the discovery and validation cohorts, the risk model using the aforementioned parameters exhibited excellent discriminatory ability for progression-free survival and OS.

The reduced risk of prostate cancer death was restricted to men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer with no differences observed in men with low- or high-risk prostate cancer.  Conclusion:   During the study period, the risk of prostate cancer death decreased in the total population of men with localised prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy. The decrease was restricted to men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer.""","""['Frederik B Thomsen', 'Hans Garmo', 'Klaus Brasso', 'Lars Egevad', 'Pär Stattin']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Surg Oncol""","""['Radical prostatectomy versus deferred treatment for localised prostate cancer.', 'Radical Prostatectomy or Watchful Waiting in Prostate Cancer - 29-Year Follow-up.', 'Active monitoring, radical prostatectomy and radical radiotherapy in PSA-detected clinically localised prostate cancer: the ProtecT three-arm RCT.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.']"""

To our knowledge, this is the first article comparing the surgical perspective and satisfaction of patients who underwent RARP with the SP and Xi platforms. To determine the patient surgical perspective and satisfaction in terms of pain control, return to normal activity, and overall results of surgery for two groups who underwent SP and Xi radical prostatectomy. The data from 71 consecutive patients who underwent SP RARP in a single center from June 2019 to April 2020 was compared to 875 patients who underwent Xi RARP in the same period. A single surgeon performed all procedures with a transperitoneal technique. After a propensity score match, two groups of 71 patients (SP and Xi) were selected and compared in the study. Patients were contacted by phone by two interviewers and a questionnaire was administered in English or Spanish. Patients were instructed not to disclose the type of robotic surgery they underwent, as interviewers were blinded to that information. A validated Surgical Satisfaction Questionnaire (SSQ-8) was used, along with an additional question from our institution asking about the satisfaction with the number of incision sites (GRI-1). Data were analyzed as continuous and discrete variables to compare the differences between the Xi and SP cohorts. A response rate of 85.9% (n = 61) in the Xi group and 73.2% (n = 52) in the SP group was captured. Overall satisfaction with surgical results was 80% and 88% in the Xi and SP cohorts, respectively. No statistical difference in responses was found between the Xi and SP cohorts for SSQ-8. However, GRI-1 demonstrated a statistically significant difference (P < 0.001) in terms of number of scars that favors the SP approach. Limitations of this study are the small sample size and recall bias. We found no statistical difference between the groups regarding the answers for SSQ-8 questionnaire; both groups were very satisfied. When assessing the number of incision sites with the GRI-1 question, patients who underwent MP had lower satisfaction rates compared to SP. These patients perceived the number of scars and their appearance as reason for lower satisfaction. We believe that future studies should consider patient's postoperative perspective when adopting new platforms in order to combine adequate treatment with patient expectations. We performed a study assessing the postoperative satisfaction and perspectives of two groups of patients who underwent radical prostatectomy with two different robots (SP and Xi). There was no difference in patient satisfaction with the results of either the da Vinci® SP or Xi RARP except for the patients' perception on their number of scars, which favored the SP group.""","""['Jonathan Noël', 'Marcio Covas Moschovas', 'Marco Sandri', 'Seetharam Bhat', 'Travis Rogers', 'Sunil Reddy', 'Cathy Corder', 'Vipul Patel']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Robot Surg""","""['Laparoscopy/New Technology.', 'Comparing the Approach to Radical Prostatectomy Using the Multiport da Vinci Xi and da Vinci SP Robots: A Propensity Score Analysis of Perioperative Outcomes.', 'Technical Modifications Necessary to Implement the da Vinci Single-port Robotic System.', 'Pure Single-site Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Using Single-port Versus Multiport Robotic Radical Prostatectomy: A Single-institution Comparative Study.', 'Perioperative Outcomes Between Single-Port and ""Multi-Port"" Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Where do we stand?', 'Standard Multiport vs Single-Port Robot-Assisted Simple Prostatectomy: A Single-Center Initial Experience.', 'Single-Port Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Where Do We Stand?', 'Systematic literature review of cost-effectiveness analyses of robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy for localised prostate cancer.', 'Can a single-port robot be safely used for robotic total gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer?

Investigation of the transcriptome in castration-resistant PC (CRPC) revealed OCT4 as a key TF in the disease pathology. OCT4 confers epigenetic changes by promoting complex formation with FOXA1 and androgen receptor (AR), the central signals for the progression to CRPC. Meanwhile, OCT4 facilitates a distinctive complex formation with nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) to gain chemo-resistance in the absence of AR. Mechanistically, we reveal that OCT4 increases large droplet formations with AR/FOXA1 as well as NRF1 in vitro. Disruption of TF collaborations using a nucleoside analogue, ribavirin, inhibited treatment-resistant PC tumor growth.

Lineage plasticity is a spectrum, but neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is the most virulent example. Currently, there are limited treatments for NEPC. Moreover, the incidence of treatment-emergent NEPC (t-NEPC) is increasing in the era of novel AR inhibitors. In contradistinction to de novo NEPC, t-NEPC tumors often express the AR, but AR's functional role in t-NEPC is unknown. Furthermore, targetable factors that promote t-NEPC lineage plasticity are also unclear.  Experimental design:   Using an integrative systems biology approach, we investigated enzalutamide-resistant t-NEPC cell lines and their parental, enzalutamide-sensitive adenocarcinoma cell lines. The AR is still expressed in these t-NEPC cells, enabling us to determine the role of the AR and other key factors in regulating t-NEPC lineage plasticity.  Results:   AR inhibition accentuates lineage plasticity in t-NEPC cells-an effect not observed in parental, enzalutamide-sensitive adenocarcinoma cells. Induction of an AR-repressed, lineage plasticity program is dependent on activation of the transcription factor E2F1 in concert with the BET bromodomain chromatin reader BRD4. BET inhibition (BETi) blocks this E2F1/BRD4-regulated program and decreases growth of t-NEPC tumor models and a subset of t-NEPC patient tumors with high activity of this program in a BETi clinical trial.  Conclusions:   E2F1 and BRD4 are critical for activating an AR-repressed, t-NEPC lineage plasticity program. BETi is a promising approach to block this program.""","""['Dae-Hwan Kim#', 'Duanchen Sun#', 'William K Storck#', 'Katherine Welker Leng#', 'Chelsea Jenkins#', 'Daniel J Coleman', 'David Sampson', 'Xiangnan Guan', 'Anbarasu Kumaraswamy', 'Eva S Rodansky', 'Joshua A Urrutia', 'Jacob A Schwartzman', 'Chao Zhang', 'Himisha Beltran', 'Mark P Labrecque', 'Colm Morrissey', 'Jared M Lucas', 'Ilsa M Coleman', 'Peter S Nelson', 'Eva Corey', 'Samuel K Handelman', 'Jonathan Z Sexton', 'Rahul Aggarwal', 'Wassim Abida', 'Felix Y Feng', 'Eric J Small', 'Daniel E Spratt', 'Armand Bankhead rd', 'Arvind Rao', 'Emily M Gesner', 'Sarah Attwell', 'Sanjay Lakhotia', 'Eric Campeau', 'Joel A Yates', 'Zheng Xia', 'Joshi J Alumkal']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['The long noncoding RNA H19 regulates tumor plasticity in neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'The Role of Epigenetic Change in Therapy-Induced Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer Lineage Plasticity.', 'Combination therapy with androgen receptor N-terminal domain antagonist EPI-7170 and enzalutamide yields synergistic activity in AR-V7-positive prostate cancer.', 'Resistance to androgen receptor signaling inhibition does not necessitate development of neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Molecular model for neuroendocrine prostate cancer progression.', 'Lineage plasticity and treatment resistance in prostate cancer: the intersection of genetics, epigenetics, and evolution.', 'ZBTB7A as a novel vulnerability in neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'LSD1 Inhibition Disrupts Super-Enhancer-Driven Oncogenic Transcriptional Programs in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Improving anti-tumor efficacy of low-dose Vincristine in rhabdomyosarcoma via the combination therapy with FOXM1 inhibitor RCM1.', 'Role of transcription factors and chromatin modifiers in driving lineage reprogramming in treatment-induced neuroendocrine prostate cancer.']"""

The objectives were to perform a clinical service evaluation of partial to whole-gland TULSA for patients with localized prostate cancer (CaP). TULSA was also evaluated as a combined therapy for a subset of patients presenting with both cancer and concurrent benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH).  Subjects and methods:   This retrospective, consecutive clinical service evaluation included men with histopathologically-confirmed CaP who underwent TULSA either as primary or salvage treatment. The planned ablation was dependent on the individual tumor characteristics, concurrent BPH and patient preferences. The Clavien-Dindo classification was used to record complications. Surgeon-assessed functional outcomes were reported. Early treatment success was defined by negative multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) and lack of prostate specific antigen (PSA) recurrence.  Results:   Fifty-two consecutive patients (47 treatment-naïve and 5 salvage) were included, with median follow-up of sixteen months and a max of thirty-six months. Baseline median (IQR) age and PSA were 67 years (63-76) and 8.0 ng/ml (5.2-13), respectively. Two Grade IIIa adverse events were observed, with no bowel-related complications.

Cholesterol is required for biosynthesis of all steroid hormones, including androgens. Impact of cholesterol-lowering statins on androgens is unknown. We explored atorvastatin influence on serum and prostatic tissue steroidomic profiles (SP) to expose novel pathways for limiting androgen concentration in men with PCa.  Methods:   This is a pre-planned post hoc analysis of ESTO-1 pilot randomised, double-blinded, clinical trial. Statin naïve men, scheduled for radical prostatectomy due to localised PCa, were randomised 1:1 to use daily 80 mg of atorvastatin or placebo before the surgery for a median of 28 days. Participants were recruited and treated at the Pirkanmaa Hospital District, Tampere, Finland. 108 of the 158 recruited men were included in the analysis based on sample availability for hormone profiling. Serum and prostatic tissue steroid profiles were determined using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Wilcoxon rank sum test and bootstrap confidence intervals (CI) were used to analyse the difference between placebo and atorvastatin arms.  Findings:   Most serum and prostatic steroids, including testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, were not associated with atorvastatin use. However, atorvastatin use induced serum SP changes in 11-ketoandrostenedione (placebo 960pM, atorvastatin 617.5pM, p-value <0.0001, median difference -342.5; 95% CI -505.23 - -188.98). In the prostatic tissue, atorvastatin was associated with plausible downshift in 11- ketodihydrotestosterone (placebo 25.0pM in 100 mg tissue/1 mL saline, atorvastatin 18.5pM in 100 mg tissue/1 mL saline, p-value 0.027, median difference -6.53; 95% CI -12.8 - -0.29); however, this association diminished after adjusting for multiple testing. No serious harms were reported.  Interpretation:   Atorvastatin was associated with adrenal androgen downshift in the serum and possibly in the prostate. The finding warrants further investigation whether atorvastatin could improve androgen deprivation therapy efficacy.

This paper highlights the role of anger in the anxiety depression pathway among men with prostate cancer, and whether its impact is dependent on loneliness. Data are presented from a sample of men with prostate cancer (N = 105, M = 69.12 years, prostatectomy = 63.8%) and analysed using conditional process analysis. Dimensions of anger were evaluated as parallel mediators in bi-directional anxiety and depression pathways. Loneliness was evaluated as a conditional moderator of identified significant mediation relationships. Moderate severity depression (16.5%) was endorsed more frequently than moderate severity anxiety (8.6%, p = .008), with 19.1% of the sample reporting past two-week suicide ideation. Consistent with hypotheses, anger-related social interference (but not other dimensions of anger) significantly mediated the anxiety-depression pathway, but not the reverse depression-anxiety pathway. This indirect effect was conditional on men experiencing loneliness. Sensitivity analyses indicated the observed moderated mediation effect occurred for affective, but not somatic symptoms of depression. Findings support anger-related social interference (as opposed to anger frequency, intensity, duration or antagonism) as key to explaining the previously established anxiety-depression pathway. Results underscore the need for enhanced psychosocial supports for men with prostate cancer, with a particular focus on relational aspects. Supporting men with prostate cancer to adaptively process and manage their anger in ways that ameliorate negative social consequences will likely enhance their perceived social support quality, which may in turn better facilitate post-diagnosis recovery and emotional adjustment.""","""['Simon M Rice', 'David Kealy', 'John S Ogrodniczuk', 'Zac E Seidler', 'Gabriela Montaner', 'Suzanne Chambers', 'John L Oliffe']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Am J Mens Health""","""['The Cost of Bottling It Up: Emotion Suppression as a Mediator in the Relationship Between Anger and Depression Among Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'Relationship between Worry, and Anger Rumination with Cardiovascular Disease Severity: Social Loneliness as a Moderator.', 'Loneliness, depression, and social support of patients with cancer and their caregivers.', 'Associations among homesickness, anger, anxiety, and depression.', 'Psychosocial interventions for men with prostate cancer.', 'Racial Disparities and Mental Health Effects Within Prostate Cancer.']"""

Several studies have identified that circular RNAs (circRNAs) have a crucial impact on the biological processes in PCa. Therefore, it is necessary to study the molecular mechanism of circRNAs in tumor progression and metastasis.  Methods:   RNA interference was used to decrease circHIPK3 and MTDH expression. Overexpression vector was used to increase circHIPK3 and MTDH expression. Luciferase reporter assay were used to detect the relationship between circHIPK3 and miR-448 or between miR-448 and MTDH. MTT assay, colony formation assay and transwell assay were used to measure proliferation and migration of PCa cells.  Results:   Circular RNA circHIPK3 was significantly increased in PCa tissues and cell lines. And overexpression of circHIPK3 promoted the migration, proliferation, and invasion of PC-3 and 22Rv1 cells, while knockdown of circHIPK3 markedly repressed the above-mentioned series of biological processes. Furthermore, circHIPK3 promoted metadherin (MTDH) expression by sponging miR-448. In vivo experiments, it was also found that overexpression of circHIPK3 significantly promoted tumor growth.  Conclusions:   Our research shows that circHIPK3 plays a carcinogenic effect in PCa by regulating the miR-448/MTDH axis, indicating that circHIPK3 may be a potential therapeutic target for PCa.""","""['D C Liu#', 'L L Song#', 'X Z Li', 'Q Liang', 'Z G Zhang', 'C H Han']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Clin Transl Oncol""","""['Exosomal circRNA HIPK3 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and metastasis in prostate cancer by regulating miR-212/BMI-1 pathway.', 'Knockdown of long noncoding RNA TP73-AS1 suppresses the malignant progression of breast cancer cells in vitro through targeting miRNA-125a-3p/metadherin axis.', 'Circular RNA HIPK3 induces cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis in non-small cell lung cancer through sponging miR-149.', 'Emerging landscape of circHIPK3 and its role in cancer and other diseases (Review).', 'The multifaceted role of MTDH/AEG-1 in cancer progression.', 'Understanding the Dual Roles of CircHIPK3 in Tumorigenesis and Tumor Progression.', 'The Diagnostic and Therapeutic Role of Circular RNA HIPK3 in Human Diseases.', 'Circular RNA: An emerging frontier in RNA therapeutic targets, RNA therapeutics, and mRNA vaccines.', 'circHIPK3 regulates cell proliferation and migration by sponging microRNA-124 and regulating serine/threonine kinase 3 expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.']"""

Methods:   We performed a prospective, observational study including patients that underwent prostate biopsy due to a visible lesion in mpMRI (PI-RADS ≥ 3). We consecutively assessed two platforms with a rigid image registration (BioJet, D&K Technologies and UroNav, Invivo Corporation) and one with an elastic registration (Trinity, KOELIS). Four urologists evaluated each fusion system in terms of usability based on the System Usability Scale and diagnostic accuracy based on the detection of prostate cancer.  Results:   We enrolled 60 consecutive patients that received mpMRI/TRUS-guided prostate biopsy with the BioJet (n = 20), UroNav (n = 20) or Trinity (n = 20) fusion system. Comparing the rigid with the elastic registration systems, the rigid registration systems were more user-friendly compared to the elastic registration systems (p = 0.012). Similarly, the prostate biopsy with the rigid registration systems had a shorter duration compared to the elastic registration system (p < 0.001). Overall, 40 cases of prostate cancer were detected. Of them, both the BioJet and UroNav fusion systems detected 13 prostate cancer cases, while the Trinity detected 14. No significant differences were demonstrated among the three fusion biopsy systems in terms of highest ISUP Grade Group (p > 0.99).

The resulting optimization problem is expressed as a cost function to be optimized. Here, we map the cost function into an Ising-like Hamiltonian, describing a system of long-range interacting qubits. Finally, we solve the dose optimization problem by finding the ground-state of the Hamiltonian using a Tree Tensor Network algorithm.

Materials and methods:   This retrospective study enrolled patients with muscle-invasive, locally advanced and metastatic bladder cancer in a single institute evaluated with 18F-FDG PET/MRI. All patients also underwent conventional imaging with CT. Additional imaging may also have included 18F-FDG PET/CT (18F-FDG PET), or sodium fluoride (NaF) PET/CT in some patients. Images were reviewed by a diagnostic radiologist/nuclear medicine physician. Number of lesions and sites of disease were captured and compared between 18F-FDG PET/MRI and conventional imaging. Lesions were confirmed by sequential imaging or lesion biopsy. All patients were followed for survival.  Results:   Fifteen patients (4 for surveillance; 11 for restaging) underwent 34 18F-FDG PET/MRI scans. Each patient received a corresponding conventional CT around the time of the 18F-FDG PET/MRI (median 6 days). The 15 patients (11 male; 4 female) had a median age of 61.5 years (range 37-73) and histologies of urothelial carcinoma (n = 13) and small-cell carcinoma of the bladder (n = 2) diagnosed as stage 4 (n = 13), stage 3 (n = 1), or stage 2 (n = 1). 18F-FDG PET/MRI detected 82 metastatic malignant lesions involving lymph nodes (n = 22), liver (n = 10), lung (n = 34), soft tissue (n = 12), adrenal glands (n = 1), prostate (n = 1), and bone (n = 2) with a resultant advantage of 36% for lesion visibility in comparison with CT.

Objective:   To report the outcomes of the SAKK 09/10 trial comparing conventional and dose-intensified SRT.  Design, setting, and participants:   SAKK 09/10 was a randomized, multicenter, phase 3 trial that recruited men with biochemical progression after RP.  Intervention:   Patients were randomly assigned to conventional-dose (64 Gy) or dose-intensified SRT (70 Gy) to the prostate bed without hormonal therapy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary endpoint was freedom from biochemical progression (FFBP). Secondary endpoints included clinical progression-free survival (PFS), time to hormonal treatment, overall survival (OS), acute and late toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0), and quality of life (QoL).  Results and limitations:   Between February 2011 and April 2014, 350 patients were randomly assigned to 64 Gy (n = 175) or 70 Gy (n = 175). Median prostate-specific antigen at randomization was 0.3 ng/ml. After median follow-up of 6.2 yr, the median FFBP was 8.2 yr in the 64 Gy arm and 7.6 in the 70 Gy arm (log-rank p = 0.4), with a hazard ratio of 1.14 (95% confidence interval 0.82-1.60). The 6-year FFBP rates were 62% and 61%, respectively. No significant differences in clinical PFS, time to hormonal treatment, or OS were observed. Late grade 2 and 3 genitourinary toxicity was observed in 35 (21%) and 13 (7.9%) patients in the 64 Gy arm, and 46 (26%) and seven (4%) in the 70 Gy arm, respectively (p = 0.8). Late grade 2 and 3 gastrointestinal toxicity was observed in 12 (7.3%) and seven patients (4.2%) in the 64 Gy arm, and 35 (20%) and four (2.3%) in the 70 Gy arm, respectively (p = 0.009). There were no significant differences in QoL.  Conclusions:   Conventional-dose SRT to the prostate bed is sufficient in patients with early biochemical progression of prostate cancer after RP.  Patient summary:   The optimal radiation therapy dose for patients who have increased tumor markers after surgery for prostate cancer is unclear. We found that administering a higher dose only increased the gastrointestinal side effects without providing any benefits to the patient.

For a variety of reasons, these designs often fail to accrue enough participants to conclude. This is particularly challenging in localized prostate cancer. The cohort multiple randomised controlled trial (cmRCT) trial design may represent an alternative approach to delivering robust comparative data in prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   IP3-PROSPECT is a cmRCT designed to test multiple prostate cancer interventions from eligible men in one cohort. Key to the design is two points of consent. First, at point of consent one, men referred for prostate cancer investigations are invited to join the cohort. They may then be randomly invited at a later date to consider an intervention at point of consent two. In the pilot phase we will test the acceptability and feasibility of developing the cohort.  Results:   Acceptability and feasibility of the study will be measured by a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. The primary outcome measure is the rate of consent to inclusion to the IP3-PROSPECT cohort. Secondary outcome measures include the completeness of data collection at sites and return rates of patient questionnaires. We will also interview patients and healthcare professionals to explore their thoughts on the implementation, practicality and efficiency of IP3-PROSPECT.  Conclusion:   The IP3-PROSPECT study will evaluate the cmRCT design in prostate cancer. Initially we will pilot the design, assessing for acceptability and feasibility.

Aim of the study:   The pharmacokinetic profiles of the absorbed components from aqueous and ethanolic extracts of VF in rat plasma were performed, and explored the molecular mechanisms of absorbed components via network pharmacology.  Materials and methods:   Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (UHPLC-MS/MS) was employed to identify the absorbed components from rat plasma. Liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate was used to purify the plasma samples. Plasma pharmacokinetics parameters of the components absorbed were analyzed after oral administration of both extracts. Network pharmacology was used to predict the biological functions and potential signaling pathways of VF. The anti-cancer effects of VF extract and absorbed components have been confirmed by in vitro experiments.  Results:   The method was very sensitive with lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 1.0, 2.5, 0.2 and 0.5 ng/mL for agnuside, 10-O-vanilloylaucubin, luteolin and casticin, respectively. With the exception of 10-O-vanilloylaucubin which was not detected in the ethanolic extract of VF, all other components were detected in both extracts in plasma. The pharmacokinetic parameters of the four components from rat plasma were significantly different between the two extracts. According to the results of network pharmacology, the absorption components of VF are enriched in 32 key pathways, and 15 pathways are related to cancer. Ultimately, the anti-cancer effects, as well as the signaling pathways of VF ethanolic extract and absorbed components were verified by in vitro experiments.  Conclusion:   The optimized, sensitive and validated UHPLC-MS/MS method was successfully applied for the plasma pharmacokinetics comparison analysis of the two VF extracts. The combination of network pharmacology and pharmacokinetics provides a useful method to elucidate the biological effects and molecular mechanism of the absorbed components of VF.""","""['Xuanhao Chen', 'Xiaoyan Wang', 'Lin Ma', 'Shiming Fang', 'Jin Li', 'Evans Owusu Boadi', 'Jun He', 'Xiu-Mei Gao', 'Yu Wang', 'Yan-Xu Chang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Ethnopharmacol""","""['Vitex rotundifolia Fruit Suppresses the Proliferation of Human Colorectal Cancer Cells through Down-regulation of Cyclin D1 and CDK4 via Proteasomal-Dependent Degradation and Transcriptional Inhibition.', 'A UPLC-MS/MS method for in vivo and in vitro pharmacokinetic studies of psoralenoside, isopsoralenoside, psoralen and isopsoralen from Psoralea corylifolia extract.', 'Network pharmacology strategy for revealing the pharmacological mechanism of pharmacokinetic target components of San-Ye-Tang-Zhi-Qing formula for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.', 'Casticin as potential anticancer agent: recent advancements in multi-mechanistic approaches.', 'The pharmacokinetics profiles, pharmacological properties, and toxicological risks of dehydroevodiamine: A review.', 'Xuanfei Baidu Formula attenuates LPS-induced acute lung injury by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway.']"""

Methods:   We identified all men (n = 36,591) diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2013-2015 in the VHA. Of the 36,591, 35,364 (96.6%) had an available Care Assessment Needs (CAN) score (range: 0-99) automatically calculated in the 30 days prior to the date of diagnosis. It was designed to estimate short-term risks of hospitalization and mortality. We fit unadjusted and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models to determine the association between the CAN score and overall survival among men with prostate cancer. We compared CAN score performance to two established comorbidity measures: The Charlson Comorbidity Index and Prostate Cancer Comorbidity Index (PCCI).  Results:   Among 35,364 men, the CAN score correlated with overall stage, with mean scores of 46.5 ( ± 22.4), 58.0 ( ± 24.4), and 68.1 ( ± 24.3) in localized, locally advanced, and metastatic disease, respectively. In both unadjusted and adjusted models for prostate cancer risk, the CAN score was independently associated with survival (HR = 1.23 95%CI 1.22-1.24 & adjusted HR = 1.17 95%CI 1.16-1.18 per 5-unit change, respectively). The CAN score (overall C-Index 0.74) yielded better discrimination (AUC = 0.76) than PCCI (AUC = 0.65) or Charlson Comorbidity Index (AUC = 0.66) for 5-year survival.

Therefore, its use has been increasing over time. In this study, the use of prebiopsy MRI among Medicare beneficiaries with prostate cancer was examined. It was hypothesized that patients of color and those in isolated areas would be less likely to undergo this approach for cancer detection.  Methods:   Using cancer registry data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program linked to billing claims for fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries, men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer were identified from 2010 through 2015 with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <30 ng/mL. Outcome was prebiopsy MRI of the prostate performed within 6 months before diagnosis (ie, Current Procedural Terminology 72197). Exposures were patient race/ethnicity and rural/urban status. Multivariable regression estimated the odds of prebiopsy prostate MRI. Post hoc analyses examined associations with the registry-level proportion of non-Hispanic Black patients and MRI use, as well as disparities in MRI use in registries with data on more frequent use of prostate MRI.  Results:   There were 50,719 men identified with prostate cancer (mean age, 72.1 years). Overall, 964 men (1.9% of cohort) had a prebiopsy MRI.

Our objective was to identify patterns and predictors of OAA use within 12 months after mRCC was detected to understand real-world adoption of OAAs.  Methods:   We used a novel, North Carolina cancer registry-linked multipayer claims data resource to examine patterns of use of five oral therapies among patients with mRCC diagnosed in 2006-2015, with claims through 2016. Patients were required to have 12 months of continuous enrollment before metastatic index date. Log-Poisson models estimated unadjusted and adjusted risk ratios (RRs) for associations between patient characteristics and OAA use. In sensitivity analyses, we used a competing risk framework to estimate adjusted risk differences in OAA use.  Results:   Our population-based study of 713 patients demonstrated low (37%) OAA use during the first year after metastatic index date among both publicly and privately insured patients, with shifting patterns of use consistent with regulatory approvals over time. Compared with patients age 18-49 years, patients age 70-74 years were half likely to use OAAs (95% confidence limit [CL], 0.34 to 0.78) and patients age 80+ years were 71% less likely to use OAAs (95% CL, 0.17 to 0.50).

Welch's two-sample t tests were performed and the raw P values were then adjusted using Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to correct for multiple comparisons. The level of statistical significance was defined by choosing false discovery rate at .05 for the primary analysis.  Results:   We observed temporary statistically significant reductions in Canadians' relative search volumes for various cancers, largely early in the pandemic, in the spring of 2020. Specifically, significant reductions (after adjustment for multiple comparisons) were observed for breast cancer in April, May, and October 2020; colon cancer in March and April of 2020; lung cancer in April and September 2020; and prostate cancer in April and May 2020. Thyroid cancer relative search volumes were not significantly different from those observed prior to the pandemic.  Conclusion:   Although Canadians' online interest in various cancers temporarily waned early in the COVID-19 pandemic, recent relative search volumes for various cancers are largely not significantly different from prior to the pandemic.""","""['Ruoyong Xu', 'Patrick Brown', 'Nancy Baxter', 'Anna M Sawka']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""JCO Clin Cancer Inform""","""['Online public interest in common malignancies and cancer screening during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.', 'Information-Seeking Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic Across the United States: Longitudinal Analysis of Google Trends Data.', 'Relationship Between State-Level Google Online Search Volume and Cancer Incidence in the United States: Retrospective Study.', 'Otolaryngology-related Google Search trends during the COVID-19 pandemic.', 'Silver lining of COVID-19: Heightened global interest in pneumococcal and influenza vaccines, an infodemiology study.', 'Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Interest of Google Queries in Cancer Screening and Cancers: A Retrospective Study.', 'Impact of Breast Cancer Awareness Month on Public Interest in the United States between 2012 and 2021: A Google Trends Analysis.', 'Online public interest in common malignancies and cancer screening during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.']"""

The purpose of this study is the head-to-head intra-individual comparison of 68Ga-FAPI versus standard-of-care 18F-FDG in PET/CT in organ biodistribution and tumor uptake in patients with various cancers.  Material and methods:   This international retrospective multicenter analysis included PET/CT data from 71 patients from 6 centers who underwent both 68Ga-FAPI and 18F-FDG PET/CT within a median time interval of 10 days (range 1-89 days). Volumes of interest (VOIs) were manually drawn in normal organs and tumor lesions to quantify tracer uptake by SUVmax and SUVmean. Furthermore, tumor-to-background ratios (TBR) were generated (SUVmax tumor/ SUVmax organ).  Results:   A total of 71 patients were studied of, which 28 were female and 43 male (median age 60). In 41 of 71 patients, the primary tumor was present. Forty-three of 71 patients exhibited 162 metastatic lesions. 68Ga-FAPI uptake in primary tumors and metastases was comparable to 18F-FDG in most cases. The SUVmax was significantly lower for 68Ga-FAPI than 18F-FDG in background tissues such as the brain, oral mucosa, myocardium, blood pool, liver, pancreas, and colon. Thus, 68Ga-FAPI TBRs were significantly higher than 18F-FDG TBRs in some sites, including liver and bone metastases.  Conclusion:   Quantitative tumor uptake is comparable between 68Ga-FAPI and 18F-FDG, but lower background uptake in most normal organs results in equal or higher TBRs for 68Ga-FAPI. Thus, 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT may yield improved diagnostic information in various cancers and especially in tumor locations with high physiological 18F-FDG uptake.""","""['Frederik L Giesel', 'Clemens Kratochwil', 'Joel Schlittenhardt', 'Katharina Dendl', 'Matthias Eiber', 'Fabian Staudinger', 'Lukas Kessler', 'Wolfgang P Fendler', 'Thomas Lindner', 'Stefan A Koerber', 'Jens Cardinale', 'David Sennung', 'Manuel Roehrich', 'Juergen Debus', 'Mike Sathekge', 'Uwe Haberkorn', 'Jeremie Calais', 'Sebastian Serfling', 'Andreas L Buck']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Head-to-head Intra-individual Comparison of 68Ga-FAPI and 18F-FDG PET/CT in Patients with Bladder Cancer.', '68Ga-FAPI-PET/CT in patients with various gynecological malignancies.', 'Biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, dosimetry of 68GaGa-DOTA.SA.FAPi, and the head-to-head comparison with 18FF-FDG PET/CT in patients with various cancers.', 'Fibroblast-Activation Protein PET and Histopathology in a Single-Center Database of 324 Patients and 21 Tumor Entities.', 'Head-To-Head Comparison of 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT and FDG PET/CT for the Detection of Peritoneal Metastases: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', '68GaGa-FAPI-04 PET/CT in the evaluation of epithelial ovarian cancer: comparison with 18FF-FDG PET/CT.', 'The Prognostic and therapeutic value and clinical implications of fibroblast activation protein-α as a novel biomarker in colorectal cancer.', 'Evaluation of Astatine-211-Labeled Fibroblast Activation Protein Inhibitor (FAPI): Comparison of Different Linkers with Polyethylene Glycol and Piperazine.', 'Molecular imaging of arterial fibroblast activation protein: association with calcified plaque burden and cardiovascular risk factors.', 'Synthesis, radiolabeling, and evaluation of a (4-quinolinoyl)glycyl-2-cyanopyrrolidine analogue for fibroblast activation protein (FAP) PET imaging.']"""

Despite these clear guidelines, wasteful and potentially harmful inappropriate imaging of men with prostate cancer remains prevalent.  Aim:   To understand changing population-level patterns of imaging among men with incident prostate cancer, we created a state-transition microsimulation model based on existing literature and incident prostate cancer cases.  Methods:   To create a cohort of patients, we identified incident prostate cancer cases from 2004 to 2009 that were diagnosed in men ages 65 and older from SEER. A microsimulation model allowed us to explore how this cohort's survival, quality of life, and Medicare costs would be impacted by making imaging consistent with guidelines. We conducted a probabilistic analysis as well as one-way sensitivity analysis.  Results:   When only imaging high-risk men compared to the status quo, we found that the population rate of imaging dropped from 53 to 38% and average per-person spending on imaging dropped from $236 to $157. The discounted and undiscounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratios indicated that ideal upfront imaging reduced costs and slightly improved health outcomes compared with current practice patterns, that is, guideline-concordant imaging was less costly and slightly more effective.  Conclusion:   This study demonstrates the potential reduction in cost through the correction of inappropriate imaging practices. These findings highlight an opportunity within the healthcare system to reduce unnecessary costs and overtreatment through guideline adherence.""","""['Aaron N Winn', 'Matthew Kelly', 'Shannon Ciprut', 'Dawn Walter', 'Heather T Gold', 'Steven B Zeliadt', 'Scott E Sherman', 'Danil V Makarov']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Rep (Hoboken)""","""['Regional-Level Correlations in Inappropriate Imaging Rates for Prostate and Breast Cancers: Potential Implications for the Choosing Wisely Campaign.', 'Total Medicare Costs Associated With Diagnosis and Treatment of Prostate Cancer in Elderly Men.', 'Decrease in racial disparities in the staging evaluation for prostate cancer after publication of staging guidelines.', 'Designing a theory-based intervention to improve the guideline-concordant use of imaging to stage incident prostate cancer.', 'The diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and enhanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques in aiding the localisation of prostate abnormalities for biopsy: a systematic review and economic evaluation.', 'The Economic Burden of Localized Prostate Cancer and Insights Derived from Cost-Effectiveness Studies of the Different Treatments.', 'Systematic review of interventions that improve provider compliance to imaging guidelines for prostate cancer.']"""

However, non-specific bone lesions (NSBLs), defined as mild to moderate focal bone uptake without a typical morphological correlate on CT, are a common finding on [18F]PSMA-1007 PET/CT. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical outcomes of patients with [18F]PSMA-1007 avid NSBLs, to determine whether patients with NSBLs represent a higher risk clinical cohort, and to determine whether SUVmax can be used as a classifier of bone metastasis.  Methods:   A retrospective audit of 214 men with prostate cancer was performed to investigate the clinical outcomes of [18F]PSMA-1007 avid NSBLs according to defined criteria. We also compared the serum PSA, Gleason score, and uptake time of patients with [18F]PSMA-1007 avid NSBLs to patients without [18F]PSMA-1007 avid bone lesions. Finally, we analysed an SUVmax threshold to identify bone metastases using ROC curve analysis.  Results:   Ninety-four of 214 patients (43.9%) demonstrated at least one NSBL. No [18F]PSMA-1007 avid NSBLs met criteria for a likely malignant or definitely malignant lesion after a median 15.8-month follow-up interval (11.9% definitely benign, 50.3% likely benign, and 37.7% equivocal). There were no statistically significant differences in serum PSA, Gleason score, and uptake time between patients with [18F]PSMA-1007 avid NSBLs and those without [18F]PSMA-1007 avid bone lesions. All NSBLs with adequate follow-up had SUVmax ≤ 11.1. The value of the highest SUVmax distinguished between NSBLs and definite prostate cancer bone metastases, whereby an SUVmax threshold of ≥ 7.2 maximized the Youden's index.  Conclusion:   [18F]PSMA-1007 avid NSBLs rarely represent prostate cancer bone metastases. When identified in the absence of definite metastatic disease elsewhere, it is appropriate to classify those with SUVmax < 7.2 as likely benign.

The glycolytic enzyme alpha-enolase (ENO1) present on the surface of malignant tumor cells has been identified as a metastasis-promoting factor through its function of activating plasminogen. The expression pattern of surface ENO1 (sENO1) concerning cell-to-cell or CSC heterogeneity and its functional roles await further investigation.  Methods:   The cell-to-cell expression heterogeneity of sENO1 was profiled in malignant cells from different types of cancers using flow cytometry. The subcellular localization of sENO1 and its functional roles in the invadopodia formation and cancer cell invasiveness were investigated using a series of imaging, molecular, and in vitro and in vivo functional studies.  Results:   We showed here that ENO1 is specifically localized to the invadopodial surface of a significant subset (11.1%-63.9%) of CSCs in human gastric and prostate adenocarcinomas. sENO1+ CSCs have stronger mesenchymal properties than their sENO1- counterparts. The subsequent functional studies confirmed the remarkable pro-invasive and pro-metastatic capacities of sENO1+ CSCs. Mechanistically, inhibiting the surface localization of ENO1 by downregulating caveolin-1 expression compromised invadopodia biogenesis, proteolysis, and CSC invasiveness.  Conclusions:   Our study identified the specific expression of ENO1 on the invadopodial surface of a subset of highly invasive and pro-metastatic CSCs. sENO1 may provide a diagnostically and/or therapeutically exploitable target to improve the outcome of patients with aggressive and metastatic cancers.""","""['Shenq-Shyang Huang', 'Wen-Ying Liao', 'Chung-Chi Hsu', 'Tze-Sian Chan', 'Tai-Yan Liao', 'Pei-Ming Yang', 'Li-Tzong Chen', 'Shian-Ying Sung', 'Kelvin K Tsai']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""['Corrigendum: A Novel Invadopodia-Specific Marker for Invasive and Pro-Metastatic Cancer Stem Cells.', 'Corrigendum: A Novel Invadopodia-Specific Marker for Invasive and Pro-Metastatic Cancer Stem Cells.', 'Enolase 1 regulates stem cell-like properties in gastric cancer cells by stimulating glycolysis.', 'Targeting of surface alpha-enolase inhibits the invasiveness of pancreatic cancer cells.', 'Alpha-Enolase: Emerging Tumor-Associated Antigen, Cancer Biomarker, and Oncotherapeutic Target.', 'Markers and Reporters to Reveal the Hierarchy in Heterogeneous Cancer Stem Cells.', 'TEM1 up-regulates MMP-2 and promotes ECM remodeling for facilitating invasion and migration of uterine sarcoma.', 'Tumor microenvironment enriches the stemness features: the architectural event of therapy resistance and metastasis.']"""

Despite the promising effects of immunotherapy in other solid cancers, prostate cancer has remained largely unresponsive. Oncolytic viruses represent a promising therapeutic avenue, as oncolytic virus treatment combines tumour cell lysis with activation of the immune system and mounting of effective anti-tumour responses. Mammalian Orthoreoviruses are non-pathogenic human viruses with a preference of lytic replication in human tumour cells. In this study, we evaluated the oncolytic efficacy of the bioselected oncolytic reovirus mutant jin-3 in multiple human prostate cancer models. The jin-3 reovirus displayed efficient infection, replication, and anti-cancer responses in 2D and 3D prostate cancer models, as well as in ex vivo cultured human tumour slices. In addition, the jin-3 reovirus markedly reduced the viability and growth of human cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. The infection induced the expression of mediators of immunogenic cell death, interferon-stimulated genes, and inflammatory cytokines. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the reovirus mutant jin-3 displays tumour tropism, and induces potent oncolytic and immunomodulatory responses in human prostate cancer models. Therefore, jin-3 reovirus represents an attractive candidate for further development as oncolytic agent for treatment of patients with aggressive localised or advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Arjanneke F van de Merbel', 'Geertje van der Horst', 'Maaike H van der Mark', 'Selas T F Bots', 'Diana J M van den Wollenberg', 'Corrina M A de Ridder', 'Debra Stuurman', 'Tilly Aalders', 'Sigrun Erkens-Schulz', 'Nadine van Montfoort', 'Wouter R Karthaus', 'Niven Mehra', 'Minke Smits', 'Jack A Schalken', 'Wytske M van Weerden', 'Rob C Hoeben', 'Gabri van der Pluijm']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Gene Ther""","""['Generation of Genetically RGD σ1-Modified Oncolytic Reovirus That Enhances JAM-A-Independent Infection of Tumor Cells.', 'Natural killer T cell immunotherapy combined with oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus or reovirus treatments differentially increases survival in mouse models of ovarian and breast cancer metastasis.', 'Polymorphisms in the Most Oncolytic Reovirus Strain Confer Enhanced Cell Attachment, Transcription, and Single-Step Replication Kinetics.', 'Exploring Reovirus Plasticity for Improving Its Use as Oncolytic Virus.', 'The use of immunohistochemistry to determine oncolytic reovirus distribution and replication in-human tumors.', 'The future of patient-derived xenografts in prostate cancer research.', 'Oncolyic Virotherapy for Prostate Cancer: Lighting a Fire in Winter.', 'Preinduced reovirus-specific T-cell immunity enhances the anticancer efficacy of reovirus therapy.', 'Nonhuman Primate Adenoviruses of the Human Adenovirus B Species Are Potent and Broadly Acting Oncolytic Vector Candidates.']"""

Method:   Using a representative sample of the French population from the French Health Insurance database, we identified 50-52-year-old men without PCa and without any blood PSA test in the five years before 2011, 2014 and 2017 (January 1-December 31 of each year). For each of these three years, the primary outcome was the first reimbursement of a blood PSA test. We used a logistic regression model with first blood PSA test as the outcome and year as the main explanatory variable. As secondary objectives, we also identified the prescriber's specialty, the urological consultation frequency, and the number of prostate biopsies in the year after the first blood PSA test reimbursement (only for 2011 and 2014).  Results:   In 2011, 2014 and 2017, 5 275, 5 792 and 5 887 50-52-year-old men, respectively, were included. The percentage of patients with a first blood PSA test prescription decreased linearly from 2011 to 2017: 15.7% in 2011, 13.2% in 2014, and 12.4% in 2017 (p < .001). Blood PSA testing was mainly prescribed by general practitioners (>95%). The median interval between PSA tests was 13 months in 2011 and 14 months in 2014. Fewer than 10% of men had ≥1 consultation with an urologist during the year after the first blood PSA test. After the first blood PSA test, eight prostate biopsies were performed in 2011 and two in 2014.  Conclusion:   Our results suggest that in France, PCa screening is a primary care issue. Although PCa screening remains controversial and confusion exists about the best practice, our study showed a linear decrease of blood PSA test prescriptions for 50-52-year-old men between 2011 and 2017, although the reason for screening was unknown.

The ability to revolutionize cancer treatment by major targeting vehicles via the exploration of nanoemulsion suggests a potential for cancer treatment. The unique property of a biphasic liquid dosage form called nanoemulsion to reach leaky tumor vasculature is due to its nano-meter oil-droplet size of 20-200 nm. Recent reporting on nanoemulsions disclose their embracing and lay alternative for re-purposing herbal and synthetic drugs and their combination especially for targeting prostate cancer formulating an obtainable nanomedicine. So, this article emphasizes the use of nanoemulsions incorporating therapeutic agents for successful and targeted delivery for prostate cancer.""","""['Sushmita Srivastava', 'Md Faheem Haider', 'Afroz Ahmad', 'Usama Ahmad', 'Muhammad Arif', 'Asad Ali']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Drug Res (Stuttg)""","""['Nanomedicine for prostate cancer using nanoemulsion: A review.', 'Nanoemulsions: A Better Approach for Antidiabetic Drug Delivery.', 'Modification of palm kernel oil esters nanoemulsions with hydrocolloid gum for enhanced topical delivery of ibuprofen.', 'Nanoemulsions in translational research-opportunities and challenges in targeted cancer therapy.', 'Nanoparticle therapeutics for prostate cancer treatment.', 'Targeted Drug Delivery Systems for Curcumin in Breast Cancer Therapy.', 'Upgrading the Transdermal Biomedical Capabilities of Thyme Essential Oil Nanoemulsions Using Amphiphilic Oligochitosan Vehicles.']"""

However, limited data yielded contradictory results and important questions regarding the validity of the methods remain to be answered. The purpose of this study was to evaluate how clinical imaging techniques affect the stability of radiomics features by using 3D printed anthropomorphic CT phantom to test for repeatability and reproducibility of quantitative parameters.  Methods:   48 PET/CT validated lymph nodes of prostate cancer patients (24 metastatic, 24 non-metastatic) were used as a template to create a customized 3D printed anthropomorphic phantom. We subsequently scanned the phantom five times with a routine abdominal CT protocol. Images were reconstructed using iterative reconstruction and two soft tissue kernels and one bone kernel. Radiomics features were extracted and assessed for repeatability and susceptibility towards image reconstruction settings using concordance correlation coefficients.  Results:   Our analysis revealed 19 of 86 features (22 %) as highly repeatable (CCC ≥ 0.85) with low susceptibility towards image reconstruction protocols. Most features analyzed depicted critical non-repeatability with CCC's < 0.75 even under entirely consistent imaging acquisition settings. Edge enhancing kernels result in higher variances between the scans and differences in repeatability and reproducibility were detected between PSMA-positive and negative lymph nodes with overall more stable features seen in tumor positive lymph nodes.  Conclusions:   Both, repeatability and reproducibility play a crucial role in the validation process of radiomics features in clinical routine. This phantom study shows that most radiomics features in contrast to previous studies, including phantom and clinical, do not depict sufficient intra-scanner repeatability to serve as reliable diagnostic tools.""","""['Hanna Muenzfeld', 'Claus Nowak', 'Stefanie Riedlberger', 'Alexander Hartenstein', 'Bernd Hamm', 'Paul Jahnke', 'Tobias Penzkofer']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur J Radiol""","""['The impact of phantom design and material-dependence on repeatability and reproducibility of CT-based radiomics features.', 'Evaluation of repeatability and reproducibility of radiomic features produced by the fan-beam kV-CT on a novel ring gantry-based PET/CT linear accelerator.', 'Repeatability of 18 F-FDG PET radiomic features: A phantom study to explore sensitivity to image reconstruction settings, noise, and delineation method.', 'CT radiomics and PET radiomics: ready for clinical implementation?', 'Radiomics: the process and the challenges.', 'Repeatability and Reproducibility of Computed Tomography Radiomics for Pulmonary Nodules: A Multicenter Phantom Study.']"""

Identifying genomic alterations associated with mCRPC may help find new targets for drug development. In the majority of patients, obtaining a tumor biopsy is challenging because of the predominance of bone-only metastasis. In this study, we hypothesize that machine learning (ML) algorithms can identify clinically relevant patterns of genomic alterations (GAs) that distinguish mCRPC from mCSPC, as assessed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA).  Experimental design:   Retrospective clinical data from men with metastatic prostate cancer were collected. Men with NGS of cfDNA performed at a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory at time of diagnosis of mCSPC or mCRPC were included. A combination of supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms was used to obtain biologically interpretable, potentially actionable insights into genomic signatures that distinguish mCRPC from mCSPC.  Results:   GAs that distinguish patients with mCRPC (n = 187) from patients with mCSPC (n = 154) (positive predictive value = 94%, specificity = 91%) were identified using supervised ML algorithms. These GAs, primarily amplifications, corresponded to androgen receptor, Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling, G1/S cell cycle, and receptor tyrosine kinases. We also identified recurrent patterns of gene- and pathway-level alterations associated with mCRPC by using Bayesian networks, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm.  Conclusion:   These results provide clinical evidence that progression from mCSPC to mCRPC is associated with stereotyped concomitant gain-of-function aberrations in these pathways. Furthermore, detection of these aberrations in cfDNA may overcome the challenges associated with obtaining tumor bone biopsies and allow contemporary investigation of combinatorial therapies that target these aberrations.  Implications for practice:   The progression from castration-sensitive to castration-resistant prostate cancer is characterized by worse prognosis and there is a pressing need for targeted drugs to prevent or delay this transition. This study used machine learning algorithms to examine the cell-free DNA of patients to identify alterations to specific pathways and genes associated with progression. Detection of these alterations in cell-free DNA may overcome the challenges associated with obtaining tumor bone biopsies and allow contemporary investigation of combinatorial therapies that target these aberrations.""","""['Edwin Lin#', 'Andrew W Hahn#', 'Roberto H Nussenzveig#', 'Sergiusz Wesolowski', 'Nicolas Sayegh', 'Benjamin L Maughan', 'Taylor McFarland', 'Nityam Rathi', 'Deepika Sirohi', 'Guru Sonpavde', 'Umang Swami', 'Manish Kohli', 'Thereasa Rich', 'Oliver Sartor', 'Mark Yandell', 'Neeraj Agarwal']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Oncologist""","""['Survival of Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer After Disease Progression on an Androgen Receptor Axis-Targeted Therapy Given in the Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Versus Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Setting.', 'Identification of patients with metastatic castration-sensitive or metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer using administrative health claims and laboratory data.', 'Plasma Cell-Free DNA Profiling of PTEN-PI3K-AKT Pathway Aberrations in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Prognostic Value of Germline DNA Repair Gene Mutations in De Novo Metastatic and Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer.', 'Genomic Testing in Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: A Pragmatic Guide for Clinicians.', 'Detection of BRCA1, and BRCA2 Alterations in Matched Tumor Tissue and Circulating Cell-Free DNA in Patients with Prostate Cancer in a Real-World Setting.', 'Genomic landscape of advanced prostate cancer patients with BRCA1 versus BRCA2 mutations as detected by comprehensive genomic profiling of cell-free DNA.', 'Comprehensive Genomic Profiling of Cell-Free DNA in Men With Advanced Prostate Cancer: Differences in Genomic Landscape Based on Race.', 'Application of Circulating Tumor Cells and Circulating Free DNA from Peripheral Blood in the Prognosis of Advanced Gastric Cancer.']"""

An immunohistochemical study""","""The chronic inflammation influences a microenvironment, where as a result of losing control over tissue homeostatic mechanisms, the carcinogenesis process may be induced. Inflammatory response cells can secrete a number of factors that support both initiation and progression of cancer and also they may consequently induct an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), the process responsible for development of distant metastasis. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) acts as a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is considered as a link between chronic inflammation and tumor development. MIF can function as a modulator of important cancer-related genes expression, as well as an activator of signaling pathways that promotes the development of prostate cancer. The study was performed on FFPE tissues resected from patients who underwent radical prostatectomy. To investigate the relationship of studied proteins with involvement in tumor progression and initiation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, we selected clinicopathological parameters related to tumor progression. Immunohistochemical analyses of MIF, SOX-4, β-catenin and E-cadherin were performed on TMA slides. We found a statistically significant correlation of overall β-catenin expression with the both lymph node metastasis (p<0.001) and presence of angioinvasion (p = 0.012). Membrane β-catenin expression was associated with distant metastasis (p = 0.021). In turn, nuclear MIF was correlated with lymph node metastasis (p = 0.003). The positive protein-protein correlations have been shown between the total β-catenin protein expression level with level of nuclear SOX-4 protein expression (r = 0.27; p<0.05) as well as negative correlation of β-catenin expression with level of nuclear MIF protein expression (r = -0.23; p<0.05). Our results seem promising and strongly highlight the potential role of MIF in development of nodal metastases as well as may confirm an involvement of β-catenin in disease spread in case of prostate cancer.""","""['Martyna Parol-Kulczyk', 'Arkadiusz Gzil', 'Joanna Maciejewska', 'Magdalena Bodnar', 'Dariusz Grzanka']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Markers β-catenin, Snail, and E-Cadherin do not Predict Disease Free Survival in Prostate Adenocarcinoma: a Prospective Study.', 'Metformin inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer cells: involvement of the tumor suppressor miR30a and its target gene SOX4.', 'ZEB1 promotes the progression and metastasis of cervical squamous cell carcinoma via the promotion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'Macrophage migration inhibitory factor: a potential driver and biomarker for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'TA-MSCs, TA-MSCs-EVs, MIF: their crosstalk in immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.']"""

In this study, we simulated various contouring practices in prostate cancer RT to investigate the impact of changing input data on atlas-based ML treatment planning. We generated 225 ML plans for nine bespoke contouring protocol scenarios (reduced target margins, modified organ-at-risk (OAR) definitions, and inclusion of optional OARs less represented in the training database) on 25 patient datasets by applying a single, previously trained and validated ML model for prostate cancer followed by dose mimicking to create a final deliverable plan. ML treatment plans for each scenario were compared to base ML treatment plans that followed a contouring protocol consistent with the model training data. ML performance was evaluated based on atlas distance metrics that are calculated during ML dose prediction. There were significant changes between atlases selected for the base ML treatment plans and treatment plans when planning target volume margins were reduced and/or optional OARs were included. The deliverability of ML predicted dose distributions based on gamma analysis between predicted and mimicked final deliverable dose showed significant differences for seven out of eight scenarios compared with the base ML treatment plans.

In urology, there are well-known models of pyeloplasty simulation, urethro-vesical anastomosis and nephrectomy, which have helped in the training of urology residents (–3). Learning laparoscopic prostatectomy is a difficult surgery and requires advanced surgical skill from the surgeon (4), requires operate without a direct view of the surgical field in a two-dimensional space and with longer instruments (5).   Laparoscopic prostatectomy step by step makes the surgeon's learning curve less difficult, lead to less intraoperative complications, such as blood loss, while also enabling shorter operative time and less positive surgical margins (6).   The objective of surgical models is to simulate surgical procedures in a reliable way thus preparing the surgeon for his daily practice, surgical simulations in animal models have been described to compensate for inadequate clinical exposure (7).   The canine model of prostate cancer has many similarities with humans. Despite trying to develop a model that is as credible as possible, there are ethical issues in several countries, such as Brazil, that do not allow the use of live dogs for scientific experimentation and there is a difficulty in not standardizing the animals used (8, 9).   The swine surgical training model is widely known, accepted and used as a valuable tool in the teaching of new surgeons (10).   The porcine video laparoscopic prostatectomy model allows the urologist in training to exercise the skills required in a real surgical situation, practicing them in a single session (10). We will present an experimental model in pigs for training urology residents in laparoscopic radical prostatectomy with current techniques (–13).   The limitations found are that the prostate has no limits as well defined as in humans, the urethra is long and coiled, the fat surrounding the pelvic organs is scarce and there is no postoperative follow-up for evaluating functionality after the procedure, as well as the effectiveness of the surgery with surgical margins. However, it is similar in surgical model presented, it is reproducible and can provide a realistic simulation environment to the beginner surgeon.  Material and Methods::   In this paper, according to the institutional protocol approved by the institutional ethics and research committee FMUSP n° 964/2017 and protocol was in accordance with current international regulations for the use of animals in Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guide. Ten male pigs weighing 20 to 22kg were used. The animals were anesthetized with a combination of Telazol (5mg/kg), Xylazine (1.5mg/kg), Cetamine (22mg/kg) and Atropine (0.04mg/kg) for orotracheal intubation followed by Isoflurane (2%). Animals were euthanized at the end of the procedure with a lethal dose of KCl (2mEq/kg). The trocar insertion points were marked using the epigastric vessels and umbilical region as reference points. Initially, urethral catheterization was performed using a hydrophilic Nitinol guidewire, followed by a perineal incision to dissect the tortuous urethra of the porcine model. A malleable urethral catheter 8Fr was inserted into their bladder. The animal was placed in the Trendelenburg position inserted and 12mm trocars were inserted in its umbilical region, utilizing 10mm in the surgeon's dominant hand, 5mm in his non-dominant hand of the surgeon, and 5mm in the first assistant's trocar.   The surgeon replicates the steps performed in a laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in humans, including the bladder catheterization, dissection of the anterior bladder plane, the vesicular and prostatic dissection, the suture of the dorsal venous plexus, a prostatectomy, an urethral vesical anast omosis, as well as the waterproof test, even including the performing of surgical steps using current concepts of anterior urethral suspension as the reconstruction of the posterior plane of the rhabdosphincter.  Results::   All steps of surgery could be reproduced in all ten porcine cases. No significant bleeding was observed and the surgical time was gradually reduced fifty percent from case one to last cases.  Conclusions::   The porcine model allowed the surgeon to replicate all the steps usually performed in a laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.

While covariate models that explain the PK variability of docetaxel exist, not much is known about the effects of genetic variations on docetaxel disposition.  Methods:   Fifty patients with head and neck or prostate cancer were enrolled of whom two patients withdrew consent before the start of the study. Docetaxel was administered at either 50 or 75 mg/m2 as intravenous infusion over 1 h. One pharmacogenetic sample and a series of PK samples, either intensive (N = 5; 13 samples each) or sparse (N = 43; 6 samples each), were collected from each patient. Docetaxel levels were estimated using a validated HPLC method. Polymorphic loci on the Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Elimination (ADME) genes were identified using the PharmacoScan array platform. Population pharmacokinetic analysis was carried out using NONMEM v7.2.  Results:   Docetaxel PK was well characterized by a three-compartment model. Clearance (Cl) was found to be 18 L/h with an IIV of 45.3%. None of the genetic variants showed significant covariate effect on the Cl of docetaxel. Patients with abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were found to have 25% lower Cl as compared to patients with normal ALT values.

Our aim in this study is to point out the pathological and clinical factors affecting pPSA among the patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy(RARP) in an experienced academic centre and to make a useful risk grouping algorithm that can predict pPSA value based on operative data.  Methods:   We examined records of 1273 patients who underwent RARP retrospectively. Preoperative, operative and postoperative data were collected. Based on the PSA values (ng/mL) measured after 4-to-8 weeks of RARP, patients were divided into two groups as pPSA group (Group1)(n = 97) with PSA values ≥0.1 ng/mL and undetectable PSA group (Group2)(n = 778) with PSA values <0.1 ng/mL. Later on, Group1 was further divided into Group1a (PSA:0.1-0.2 ng/mL) and Group 1b (PSA≥0.2 ng/mL) to evaluate biochemical recurrence(BCR).  Results:   Multivariate logistic regression analyses of the collected data revealed that preoperative PSA≥20 ng/mL, operation time, a postoperative international society of urological pathology (ISUP) grade of ≥4, pT 3-4 and pN were independently associated with pPSA. Based on these results, a risk grouping algorithm predicting pPSA was developed. By looking at the risk grouping algorithm pPSA was found in 98.9% of the cases with a preoperative PSA value of ≥20 ng/mL, an operation time of 150 min, a postoperative ISUP grade of 4-5, a positive lymphovascular invasion (LVI) status, pT3-T4, and pN+; while pPSA was found in 25.5% of the cases with a preoperative PSA value of <20 ng/mL, an operation time of 100 min, a postoperative ISUP grade of <4-5, a negative LVI status, pT<3-4 and pN-. The estimated BCR-free survival time was 16.3 months in Group 1a and 57.0 months in Group2 (P < .001). Adjuvant treatment ratio was 64.9% in Group1 and 7.1% in Group2 (P < .001).

Here, we present a series of cases demonstrating that when performed using a long axial field-of-view (LAFOV) PET/CT system, late imaging is feasible and can even provide improved image quality compared to regular acquisitions.  Methods:   In this retrospective case series, we report our initial experiences with 10 patients who underwent standard imaging at 1 h p.i. following administration of 192 ± 36 MBq [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 with additional late imaging performed at 4 h p.i. Images were acquired in a single bed position for 6 min at 1 h p.i. and 16 min p.i. at 4 h p.i. using a LAFOV scanner (106 cm axial FOV). Two experienced nuclear medicine physicians reviewed all scans in consensus and evaluated overall image quality (5-point Likert scale), lesion uptake in terms of standardised uptake values (SUV), tumour to background ratio (TBR) and target-lesion signal to background noise (SNR).  Results:   Subjective image quality as rated on a 5-point Likert scale was only modestly lower for late acquisitions (4.2/5 at 4 h p.i.; 5/5 1 h p.i.), TBR was significantly improved (4 h: 3.41 vs 1 h: 1.93, p < 0.001) and SNR was improved with borderline significance (4 h: 33.02 vs 1 h: 24.80, p = 0.062) at later imaging. Images were obtained with total acquisition times comparable to routine examinations on standard axial FOV scanners.  Conclusion:   Late acquisition in tandem with a LAFOV PET/CT resulted in improvements in TBR and SNR and was associated with only modest impairment in subjective visual imaging quality. These data show that later acquisition times for [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 may be preferable when performed on LAFOV systems.""","""['Ian Alberts', 'George Prenosil', 'Clemens Mingels', 'Karl Peter Bohn', 'Marco Viscione', 'Hasan Sari', 'Axel Rominger', 'Ali Afshar-Oromieh']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Long axial field of view (LAFOV) PET-CT: implementation in static and dynamic oncological studies.', 'Long-axial field-of-view PET/CT: perspectives and review of a revolutionary development in nuclear medicine based on clinical experience in over 7000 patients.', 'Clinical performance of long axial field of view PET/CT: a head-to-head intra-individual comparison of the Biograph Vision Quadra with the Biograph Vision PET/CT.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Optimal time-point for 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging in assessment of prostate cancer: feasibility of sterile cold-kit tracer preparation?', 'Multiple angiolipomas visualized by dynamic and delayed ""total-body"" 18F-DCFPyL and 64Cu-SARbisPSMA PET/CT.', 'Long Axial Field-of-View PET/CT Could Answer Unmet Needs in Gynecological Cancers.', 'Long axial field of view (LAFOV) PET-CT: implementation in static and dynamic oncological studies.', 'Long-axial field-of-view PET/CT: perspectives and review of a revolutionary development in nuclear medicine based on clinical experience in over 7000 patients.', 'Impact of the new ultra-high sensitivity mode in a long axial field-of-view PET/CT.']"""

Vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy (VTP) is a focal therapy for low-risk low-volume localised PCa, which rapidly disrupts targeted tumour vessels. There is interest in expanding the use of VTP to higher-risk disease. Tumour vasculature is characterised by vessel immaturity, increased permeability, aberrant branching and inefficient flow. FRT alters the tumour microenvironment and promotes transient 'vascular normalisation'. We hypothesised that multimodality therapy combining fractionated radiotherapy (FRT) and VTP could improve PCa tumour control compared against monotherapy with FRT or VTP.  Methods:   We investigated whether sequential delivery of FRT followed by VTP 7 days later improves flank TRAMP-C1 PCa tumour allograft control compared to monotherapy with FRT or VTP.  Results:   FRT induced 'vascular normalisation' changes in PCa flank tumour allografts, improving vascular function as demonstrated using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. FRT followed by VTP significantly delayed tumour growth in flank PCa allograft pre-clinical models, compared with monotherapy with FRT or VTP, and improved overall survival.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is still one of the most frequent and deadly tumor in men and analysis of EVs from biological fluids of PCa patients has proven the feasibility and the unprecedented potential of such an approach. Here, we exploited an antibody-based proteomic technology, i.e. the Reverse-Phase Protein microArrays (RPPA), to measure key antigens and activated signaling in EVs isolated from sera of PCa patients. Notably, we found tumor-specific protein profiles associated with clinical settings as well as candidate markers for EV-based tumor diagnosis. Among others, PD-L1, ERG, Integrin-β5, Survivin, TGF-β, phosphorylated-TSC2 as well as partners of the MAP-kinase and mTOR pathways emerged as differentially expressed endpoints in tumor-derived EVs. In addition, the retrospective analysis of EVs from a 15-year follow-up cohort generated a protein signature with prognostic significance. Our results confirm that serum-derived EV cargo may be exploited to improve the current diagnostic procedures while providing potential prognostic and predictive information.

Regression models were adjusted for outcome-specific baseline function, clinicopathologic characteristics, and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).  Results:   587 men (median [quartiles] age 69 [64-73] years) met inclusion criteria and completed ≥1 post-treatment survey. More men treated with prostate and pelvic radiotherapy had high-risk disease (58% vs. 18%, P < 0.01) and received ADT (75% vs. 41%, P < 0.01). These men reported worse sexual (6 months-5 years), hormonal (at 6 months), and physical (6 months-5 years) function. Accounting for baseline function, patient and tumor characteristics, and use of ADT, pelvic irradiation was not associated with statistically or clinically significant differences in bowel function, urinary incontinence, irritative voiding symptoms or sexual function through 5-years (all P > 0.05). Marginally clinically important differences were noted in hormonal function at 3-years (adjusted mean difference 4.7, 95% confidence interval [1.2-8.3]; minimally clinically important difference (MCID) 4 to 6) and 5-years (4.2, [0.4-8.0]) following treatment. After adjustment, there was a transient statistically significant, but not clinically important, difference in emotional well-being at 6 months (3.0, [0.19-5.8]; MCID 6) that resolved by 1 year and no differences in physical functioning or energy and fatigue.  Conclusion:   This prospective, population-based cohort study of men with localized prostate cancer treated with EBRT, showed no clinically important differences in disease-specific or general health-related quality of life with the addition of pelvic irradiation to prostate radiotherapy, supporting the use of pelvic radiotherapy when it may be of clinical benefit, such as men with increased risk of nodal involvement.""","""['Christopher J D Wallis', 'Li-Ching Huang', 'Zhiguo Zhao', 'David F Penson', 'Tatsuki Koyama', 'Ralph Conwill', 'Jacob E Tallman', 'Michael Goodman', 'Ann S Hamilton', 'Xiao-Cheng Wu', 'Lisa E Paddock', 'Antoinette Stroup', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Mia Hashibe', ""Brock B O'Neil"", 'Sherrie H Kaplan', 'Sheldon Greenfield', 'Daniel A Barocas', 'Karen E Hoffman']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Patient-Reported Outcomes Through 5 Years for Active Surveillance, Surgery, Brachytherapy, or External Beam Radiation With or Without Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Association Between Radiation Therapy, Surgery, or Observation for Localized Prostate Cancer and Patient-Reported Outcomes After 3 Years.', 'Effect of Prostate Cancer Severity on Functional Outcomes After Localized Treatment: Comparative Effectiveness Analysis of Surgery and Radiation Study Results.', 'Dose escalated external beam radiotherapy versus neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy and conventional dose external beam radiotherapy for clinically localized prostate cancer: do we need both?', 'The effect of androgen deprivation therapy on health-related quality of life in men with prostate cancer.']"""

The clinicopathological definition of CA among prostate cancer cells (CAPCCs)-described as CA entirely surrounded by invasive cancer cells-has not been discussed. As intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDC-P) is a well-known adverse prognostic factor in prostate cancer, this study aimed to elucidate the relationship between CAPCC and IDC-P. We enrolled 366 patients who underwent robotic-assisted radical prostatectomies between 2012 and 2018 at Aichi Medical University Hospital. All surgical specimens were independently reviewed by two genitourinary pathologists. The median age of the patients was 68.5 years; the median serum prostate-specific antigen was 6.49 ng/mL. IDC-P was observed in 143 (39.1%) patients, while the presence of CAPCC was observed in 47 cases (12.8%). Patients with CAPCC were associated with more advanced clinical and pathological T stages, as well as Gleason scores, than those without CAPCC (p=0.018, p<0.001, p=0.036). Notably, the presence of CAPCC was significantly associated with the presence of IDC-P (39 cases) and a high Gleason score compared with the absence of CAPCC (12 cases) (p<0.001 and p=0.036, respectively). The presence of CAPCC is an adverse pathological feature, often closely related to IDC-P. Therefore, CAPCC may be a surrogate finding to detect IDC-P via haematoxylin and eosin staining.""","""['Miho Sugie', 'Taishi Takahara', 'Akiko Ohashi', 'Naoto Sassa', 'Toyonori Tsuzuki']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Pathology""","""[""The influence of the presence of intraductal carcinoma of the prostate on the grade group system's prognostic performance."", 'Heterogeneous clinicopathological features of intraductal carcinoma of the prostate: a comparison between ""precursor-like"" and ""regular type"" lesions.', 'Response of intraductal carcinoma of the prostate to androgen deprivation therapy predicts prostate cancer prognosis in radical prostatectomy patients.', 'Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate without High-Grade Invasive Adenocarcinoma: Report of Two Cases and Review of the Literature.', 'Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate.']"""

A handful of studies have assessed the role of PAHs exposure in prostate cancer risk, but none has examined tumor aggressiveness or the influence of screening practices and detection issues. We aimed to examine the association between lifetime occupational exposure to PAHs and prostate cancer risk.  Methods:   Detailed work histories were collected from 1,929 prostate cancer cases (436 aggressive) and 1,994 controls from Montreal, Canada (2005-2012). Industrial hygienists applied the hybrid expert approach to assign intensity, frequency and certainty of exposure to benzo[a]pyrene, PAHs from wood, coal, petroleum, other sources, and any source, in each job held. Odds ratios (ORs) for prostate cancer risk associated with lifetime PAHs exposure, adjusted for age, ancestry, education, lifestyle and occupational factors, and 95% confidence intervals (CI), were estimated using unconditional logistic regression.  Results:   After restriction to probable and definite exposures, and application of a 5-year lag, no clear association emerged for any of the PAHs, although small excesses in risk were apparent with 5-year increments in exposure to PAHs from wood (OR = 1.06, 95%CI 0.95 to 1.18). While analyses by cancer aggressiveness suggested no major differences, some elevated risk of high-grade cancer was observed for exposure to PAHs from wood (OR = 1.37, 95%CI 0.65 to 2.89), frequently occurring among firefighters.

The breakdown of muscle tissue is known as sarcopenia. This is clinically defined as loss of muscle mass and/or muscle strength, with loss of muscle strength being more important than muscle mass. Cachexia is responsible for the death of at least 20% of all cancer patients. The incidence in these patients varies, depending on the type of disease, between 80% for patients with gastric and pancreatic cancer, 50% for patients with lung, colon and prostate cancer, and about 40% for patients with breast cancer or leukemia. It is often difficult to distinguish between tumour-associated cachexia and cachexia caused by side effects and complications of oncological therapy. The main clinical feature of cachexia is involuntary weight loss, but this does not always manifest itself clinically, making it much more difficult to identify patients at risk. Not only the long-term outcome of the patient is influenced by cachexia and sarcopenia. Immediate postoperative complication rates (morbidity) are also increased and have profound effects on the burden of disease and the suffering of patients after surgical treatment. Cachexia, sarcopenia and myosteatosis are therefore highly relevant parameters for everyday clinical practice, which have a significant influence on the postoperative outcome of the patient. Several tools have been developed to aid the identification of patients with nutritional risk, i.e. involuntary weight loss, reduced muscle strength and physical condition. Such measures should be a part of our daily clinical routine to ensure the identification of patients with the highest postoperative risk. Novel preconditioning treatment may be beneficial to certain patient groups to reduce postoperative morbidity.""","""['Gregory van der Kroft', 'Steven W M Olde Damink', 'Ulf Peter Neumann', 'Andreas Lambertz']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Zentralbl Chir""","""['Cachexia versus sarcopenia.', 'Muscle contractile and metabolic dysfunction is a common feature of sarcopenia of aging and chronic diseases: from sarcopenic obesity to cachexia.', 'Ovarian cancer ascites induces skeletal muscle wasting in vitro and reflects sarcopenia in patients.', 'Definition and classification of cancer cachexia: an international consensus.', 'Sarcopenia, cachexia and congestive heart failure in the elderly.', 'Diagnostic Value of Serum Creatinine and Cystatin-C-Based Indices and Ishii Score in Cancer-Related Sarcopenia.', 'Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) Score and Sarcopenia as Mutually Independent Prognostic Biomarkers in Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma.']"""

However, effects of combination radium-223 plus abiraterone or enzalutamide on survival and safety remain unclear.  Patients and methods:   This single-center retrospective cohort study used electronic health record data of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases who were treated with radium-223 between April 1, 2014 and February 19, 2019. Patients who received radium-223 monotherapy were compared to patients who received a combination of radium-223 plus either abiraterone or enzalutamide. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, time to symptomatic skeletal event, symptomatic skeletal event-free survival, and incidence of drug-related adverse events. Time-to-event analyses were estimated by log rank tests using Kaplan-Meier curves. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were derived from Cox proportional hazards models. Chi-square tests evaluated difference in serious adverse events between the two arms.  Results:   A total of 60 patients met inclusion criteria (n = 41 in the monotherapy arm, n = 19 in the combination arm). Differences in median overall survival were not observed (12.7 vs. 12.8 months; HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.59-2.23; P = 0.68), but median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the combination arm (7.6 vs. 4.9 months; HR 1.94, 95% CI 1.11-3.40; P = 0.02). Significant differences were not observed in time to first SSE (P = 0.97), SSE-free survival (P = 0.16), or in the overall incidence of serious adverse events (P = 0.45).  Conclusion:   Combination radium-223 plus abiraterone or enzalutamide did not improve overall survival, but prolonged progression-free survival without increasing the incidence of serious adverse events in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with bone metastases.

However, condition-specific guidelines were not proposed. To inform rates of surgery for cancer, we sought to assess the current met and unmet need for oncologic surgery in Ghana.  Methods:   Data on all operations performed in Ghana over a one-year period (2014-15) were obtained from representative samples of 48/124 first-level and 12/16 referral hospitals and scaled-up for nationwide estimates. Procedures for cancer were identified by indication. Using modified LCoGS methodology with disease prevalence, Ghana's annual rate of cancer surgery was compared to that of New Zealand to quantify current unmet needs.  Results:   232,776 surgical procedures were performed in Ghana; 2,562 procedures (95%UI 1878-3255) were for cancer. Of these, 964 (37%) were surgical biopsies. The annual rate of procedures treating cancer was 2115 surgeries/100,000 cancer cases, or 21% of the New Zealand benchmark. Cervical, breast, and prostate cancer were found to meet 2.1%, 17.2%, and 32.1% of their respective surgical need.  Conclusions:   There is a large unmet need for cancer surgery in Ghana. Cancer surgery constitutes under 2% of the total surgeries performed in Ghana, an important proportion of which are used for biopsies.

Method:   In this study, using the Approximate Relative Subset of RNA Transcripts (CIBERSORT) online method, we analysed the immune cell abundance ratio of each sample in the mCRPC dataset. The EdgeR (an R package) was used to classify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Using the Database for annotation, visualisation and interactive exploration (DAVID) online method, we performed functional enrichment analyses. STRING online database and Cytoscape tools have been used to analyse protein-protein interaction (PPI) and classify hub genes.  Results:   The profiles of immune infiltration in mCRPC showed that Macrophages M2, Macrophages M0, T cells CD4 memory resting, T cells CD8 and Plasma cells were the main infiltration cell types in mCRPC samples. Macrophage M0 and T cell CD4 memory resting abundance ratios were correlated with clinical outcomes. We identified 1102 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with the above two immune cells to further explore the underlying mechanisms. Enrichment analysis found that DEGs were substantially enriched in immune response, cell metastasis, and metabolism related categories. We identified 20 hub genes by the protein-protein interaction network analysis.

The prostate tissues and the matched adjacent normal prostate tissues excised and preserved during radical prostatectomy in our hospital were collected. The LncRNA NCK1-AS1 expression was detected. PCa patients were followed up for three years to analyze their prognosis. The correlation of LncRNA NCK1-AS1 expression with clinicopathological features was analyzed. Human normal prostate cells and human PCCs were selected, in which LncRNA NCK1-AS1 expression was tested to screen and then transfect the cells. Cell proliferation, invasion and migration were detected. Cell cycles and apoptosis were analyzed. Compared with the adjacent normal tissues, LncRNA NCK1-AS1 was highly expressed in the prostate cancer tissues. Its expression was remarkably different in those with different stages of TNM and with lymphatic metastasis or not. The prognosis of patients with high LncRNA NCK1-AS1 expression was remarkably poorer than that of those with low expression. Compared with the human normal prostate cells, LncRNA NCK1-AS1 expression in the human PCCs remarkably rose, with the greatest difference in 22Rv1 cells. Compared with the Blank group, cell proliferation and the number of plate cloned cells remarkably reduced in the sh-NCK1-AS1 group. Additionally, in this group, the number of invasive and migratory cells remarkably reduced; the expression of invasion-related protein E-cadherin remarkably rose but that of MMP-2 remarkably reduced; cell cycles were arrested and the expression of cycle-related proteins (CDK4, CDK6, cyclin D1) remarkably reduced; the apoptotic rate and the expression of apoptosis-related protein Bax remarkably rose. LncRNA NCK1-AS1 is highly expressed in PCa, so its down-regulation can inhibit PCCs from proliferating and reduce the number of invasive cells.""","""['Yuxin Li', 'Xiaohong Zhuang', 'Li Zhuang', 'Hongjian Liu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Biomark""","""['LncRNA NCK1-AS1 promotes proliferation and induces cell cycle progression by crosstalk NCK1-AS1/miR-6857/CDK1 pathway.', 'LncRNA NCK1-AS1 promotes non-small cell lung cancer progression via regulating miR-512-5p/p21 axis.', 'NCK1-AS1 promotes NCK1 expression to facilitate tumorigenesis and chemo-resistance in ovarian cancer.', 'NCK1-AS1 promotes the progression of lung squamous cell carcinoma through transcriptionally upregulating NCK1 via interacting with MYC.', 'LncRNA NCK1-AS1-mediated regulatory functions in human diseases.']"""

The prostate-specific Pten conditional knockout mouse model closely imitates human PCa initiation and progression. To better understand how age impacts PCa in an experimental model, we have generated a spatially and temporally controlled Pten-null PCa murine model at different ages (aged vs. non-aged) of adult mice. Here, we present a protocol to inject the Cre-expressing adenovirus with luciferin tag, intraductally, into the prostate anterior lobes of Pten-floxed mice; Pten-loss will be triggered post-Cre expression at different ages. In vivo imaging of luciferin signal following viral infection confirmed successful delivery of the virus and Cre activity. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed prostate epithelial-specific expression of Cre recombinase and the loss of Pten and activation of P-Akt, P-S6, and P-4E-BP1. The Cre-expression, Pten ablation, and activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways were limited to the prostate epithelium. All mice developed prostatic epithelial hyperplasia within 4 weeks after Pten ablation and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) within 8 weeks post-Pten ablation. Some PINs had progressed to invasive adenocarcinoma at 8-16 weeks post-Pten ablation. Aged mice exhibited significantly accelerated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling and increased PCa onset and progression compared to young mice. The viral infection success rate is ∼80%.

Early detection of PCa by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening remains debated, leading to different specialist-specific recommendations in PCa guidelines. This study aimed to assess attitudes toward and use of PSA testing among urologists in Germany and general practitioners (GPs) in Lower Saxony (Germany).  Methods:   A nationwide questionnaire was sent to urologists via the mailing lists of the Professional Association of German Urologists and the German Urological Society. A version of the questionnaire for GPs was sent to email addresses via the Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians Lower Saxony. The online questionnaires covered use of PSA testing, information communication, handling of test results, and handling of/knowledge about national and international guidelines and recommendations on early detection of PCa. Statistical analysis was performed at a descriptive level.  Results:   In total, 432 of 6,568 urologists (6.6%) and 96 of 1,579 GPs (6.1%) participated in this survey. Urologists and GPs differed in their attitudes and approaches toward PSA testing. Most urologists (86.8%, n=375) judged the test as ""very meaningful"" or ""meaningful"", compared with 52.1% (n=50) of GPs. Almost two-thirds of the urologists (64.4%, n=278) viewed the PCa mortality reduction by PSA testing as proven, compared with one-fifth of GPs (20.8%, n=20). Almost 80% of male urologists (79.9%, n=291) indicated that they would undergo a PSA test in the future (again), compared with 55.1% of male GPs (n=38). In addition, 56.3% (n=243) of urologists stated that ""considerably more than half"" or ""almost all"" men aged 45 years or older received a PSA test, compared with 19.8% (n=19) of GPs.  Conclusions:   Urologists are more convinced about the PSA test than GPs. PSA testing is therefore used more often in urological settings, although the preselected patient population must be considered. In accordance with specialist-specific recommendations, GPs show a more reserved approach toward PSA testing. Instead of focusing on different attitudes and recommendations on PSA testing, the exchange between specialist groups should be improved to achieve a consistent approach to PSA testing.""","""['Sanny Kappen', 'Verena Jürgens', 'Michael H Freitag', 'Alexander Winter']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""['Commentary: Kappen S, Jürgens V, Freitag MH, Winter A.

The current standard therapy for PCa is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which has side effects such as cognitive dysfunction, risk of Alzheimer's disease, and dementia. Published results of in vitro tests and animal models studies have shown that mefenamic acid could be used as a neuroprotector. Objective: Examine the therapeutic potential of mefenamic acid in cognitive impairment used in a controlled clinical trial. Clinical trial phase II was conducted on patients undergoing ADT for PCa. Two groups of 14 patients were included. One was treated with a placebo, while the other received mefenamic acid 500 mg PO every 12hrs for six months. The outcome was evaluated through the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score at six months. At the beginning of the study, both groups had similar MMSE scores (mefenamic acid vs. placebo: 26.0±2.5 vs. 27.0±2.6, P=0.282). The mefenamic acid group improved its MMSE score after six months compared with the placebo group (27.7±1.8 vs. 25.5±4.2, P=0.037).

Furthermore, 42.9% of the placebo group patients had relevant cognitive decline (a 2-point decrease in the MMSE score), while in patients treated with mefenamic acid, cognitive impairment was not present.

In particular, the therapeutic potential of this cell type in adoptive cell therapy (ACT) has gained interest. In this regard optimization of in vitro expansion methods and functional characterization is desirable. We show that Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, expanded in vitro with zoledronic acid (Zometa or ZOL) and Interleukin-2 (IL-2), are efficient cancer cell killers with a trend towards increased killing efficacy after prolonged expansion time. Thus, Vγ9Vδ2 T cells expanded for 25 days in vitro killed prostate cancer cells more efficiently than Vγ9Vδ2 T cells expanded for 9 days. These data are supported by phenotype characteristics, showing increased expression of CD56 and NKG2D over time, reaching above 90% positive cells after 25 days of expansion. At the early stage of expansion, we demonstrate that Vγ9Vδ2 T cells are capable of cross-presenting tumor antigens. In this regard, our data show that Vγ9Vδ2 T cells can take up tumor-associated antigens (TAA) gp100, MART-1 and MAGE-A3 - either as long peptide or recombinant protein - and then present TAA-derived peptides on the cell surface in the context of HLA class I molecules, demonstrated by their recognition as targets by peptide-specific CD8 T cells. Importantly, we show that cross-presentation is impaired by the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin. In conclusion, our data indicate that Vγ9Vδ2 T cells are broadly tumor-specific killers with the additional ability to cross-present MHC class I-restricted peptides, thereby inducing or supporting tumor-specific αβTCR CD8 T cell responses.

Based on obervational data, Extended Nodal Irradiation (ENI) might be associated with fewer treatment failures than Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) to the involved node(s) alone. Ultra hypofractionated ENI is yet to be evaluated in this setting, but it could provide a therapeutic advantage if PCa has a low α/β ratio in addition to patient convenience/resource benefits. This volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) planning study developed a class solution for 5-fraction Extended Nodal Irradiation (ENI) plus a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) to involved node(s). Ten patients with oligorecurrent nodal disease after radical prostatectomy/post-operative prostate bed radiotherapy were selected. Three plans were produced for each dataset to deliver 25 Gy in 5 fractions ENI plus SIBs of 40, 35 and 30 Gy. The biologically effective dose (BED) formula was used to determine the remaining dose in 5 fractions that could be delivered to re-irradiated segments of organs at risk (OARs). Tumour control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) were calculated using the LQ-Poisson Marsden and Lyman-Kutcher-Burman models respectively. Six patients had an OAR positioned within planning target volume node (PTVn), which resulted in reduced target coverage to PTV node in six, five and four instances for 40, 35 and 30 Gy SIB plans respectively. In these instances, only 30 Gy SIB plans had a median PTV coverage >90% (inter-quartile range 90-95). No OAR constraint was exceeded for 30 Gy SIB plans, including where segments of OARs were re-irradiated. Gross tumour volume node (GTVn) median TCP was 95.7% (94.4-96), 90.7% (87.1-91.2) and 78.6% (75.8-81.1) for 40, 35 and 30 Gy SIB plans respectively, where an α/β ratio of 1.5 was assumed. SacralPlex median NTCP was 43.2% (0.7-61.2), 12.1% (0.6-29.7) and 2.5% (0.5-5.1) for 40, 35 and 30 Gy SIB plans respectively. NTCP for Bowel_Small was <0.3% and zero for other OARs for all three plan types. Ultra hypofractionated ENI planning for pelvic nodal relapsed PCa appears feasible with encouraging estimates of nodal TCP and low estimates of NTCP, especially where a low α/β ratio is assumed and a 30 Gy SIB is delivered. This solution should be further evaluated within a clinical trial and compared against SABR to involved node(s) alone.""","""['Finbar Slevin', 'Christopher M Thompson', 'Richard Speight', 'Louise J Murray', 'John Lilley', 'Ann M Henry']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Dosim""","""['Prostate stereotactic ablative radiation therapy using volumetric modulated arc therapy to dominant intraprostatic lesions.', 'A treatment planning and acute toxicity comparison of two pelvic nodal volume delineation techniques and delivery comparison of intensity-modulated radiotherapy versus volumetric modulated arc therapy for hypofractionated high-risk prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Volumetric-modulated arc therapy vs. c-IMRT in esophageal cancer: a treatment planning comparison.', 'Coincidental splenic irradiation and risk of functional hyposplenism in oesophageal cancer treatment.', 'Stereotactic radiotherapy for oligometastases in the lymph nodes.']"""

Methods:   This multicenter Prostatic Cancer Registry of Standard Hormonal and Chemotherapy Using Bone Scan Index study involved 30 hospitals and enrolled 247 patients (age 71 ± 8 years) with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (n = 148) under hormone therapy and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (n = 99) under chemotherapy. The Bone Scan Index (%) was determined by whole-body bone scintigraphy using 99m Tc-methylenediphosphonate. Patients were classified into tertiles and binary groups, and predictors of all-cause death including Bone Scan Index, prostate-specific antigen, and bone metabolic markers were determined using survival and proportional hazard analyses.  Results:   During a mean follow-up period of 716 ± 404 days, 81 (33%) of the patients died, and 3-year mortality rates were 20% and 52% in the metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer groups, respectively. Survival analysis showed that a Bone Scan Index >3.5% was a significant determinant of death in the metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer group, whereas prostate-specific antigen >55 ng/mL before chemotherapy was a determinant of prognosis in the metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer group. A Bone Scan Index >3.5% was also associated with a high incidence of prostate-specific antigen progression in the metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer group. Patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and a better Bone Scan Index response (>45%) to treatment had lower mortality rates than those without such response.

Subsequently, the targeted regulation analysis indicated that the racial differences in cytotoxic therapy resistance, endocrine therapy resistance, might originate from drug metabolisms, and 19 drug metabolism-related core genes were confirmed in the multi-omics network for subsequent analysis. Furthermore, we verified that CYP1A1, CYP3A4, CYP2B6, UGT2B17, UGT2B7, UGT1A8, UGT2B11, GAS5, SNHG6, XIST significantly affected antineoplastic drugs sensitivities in PCa cell lines, and these genes also showed good predictive efficiency of drug response and treatment outcomes for PCa in this cohort of patients.

Summary. BRCA1/2 deficient prostate cancers represent a clinically distinct aggressive subtype. However, the presence of BRCA1/2 alterations enhance the sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapies. The efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapies in prostate cancer has not been proven in prospective clinical studies and therefore these treatments are rarely used in prostate adenocarcinomas. Here we present a case of BRCA2 mutant prostate cancer, which was diagnosed at a metastatic stage and showed no or only little response to androgen deprivation and docetaxel therapies. Therefore, we started carboplatin chemotherapy which resulted in an exceptional response regarding biochemical, radiographic parameters accompanied by significant improvement of patients' physical condition. This case underlines the potential therapeutic benefits of testing for genes involved in the DNA repair mechanism.

Quantitative assessment of the mean apparent diffusion coefficient (mADC) is promising to improve diagnostic accuracy while radiomic machine learning (RML) allows to probe complex parameter spaces to identify the most promising multi-parametric models. We have previously developed quantitative RML and ADC classifiers for prediction of clinically significant prostate cancer (sPC) from prostate MRI, however these have not been combined with radiologist PI-RADS assessment. Purpose To propose and evaluate diagnostic algorithms combining quantitative ADC or RML and qualitative PI-RADS assessment for prediction of sPC. Methods and population The previously published quantitative models (RML and mADC) were utilized to construct four algorithms: 1) Down(ADC) and 2) Down(RML): clinically detected PI-RADS positive prostate lesions (defined as either PI-RADS≥3 or ≥4) were downgraded to MRI negative upon negative quantitative assessment; and 3) Up(ADC) and 4) Up(RML): MRI-negative lesions were upgraded to MRI-positive upon positive assessment of quantitative parameters. Analyses were performed at the individual lesion level and the patient level in 133 consecutive patients with suspicion for clinically significant prostate cancer (sPC, International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade group≥2), the test set subcohort of a previously published patient population. McNemar test was used to compare differences in sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Differences between lesions of different prostate zones were assessed using ANOVA. Reduction in false positive assessments was assessed as ratios. Results Compared to clinical assessment at the PI-RADS≥4 cut-off alone, algorithms Down(ADC/RML) improved specificity from 43% to 65% (p = 0.001)/62% (p = 0.003), while sensitivity did not change significantly at 89% compared to 87% (p = 1.0)/89% (unchanged) on the patient level. Reduction of false positive lesions was 50% [26/52] in the PZ and 53% [15/28] in the TZ. Algorithms Up(ADC/RML) led, on a patient basis, to an unfavorable loss of specificity from 43% to 30% (p = 0.039)/32% (p = 0.106), with insignificant increase of sensitivity from 89% to 96%/96% (both p = 1.0). Compared to clinical assessment at the PI-RADS≥3 cut-off alone, similar results were observed for Down(ADC) with significantly increased specificity from 2% to 23% (p < 0.001) and unchanged sensitivity on the lesion level; patient level specificity increased only non-significantly. Conclusion Downgrading PI-RADS≥3 and ≥ 4 lesions based on quantitative mADC measurements or RML classifiers can increase diagnostic accuracy by enhancing specificity and preserving sensitivity for detection of sPC and reduce false positives.""","""['Kevin Sun Zhang', 'Patrick Schelb', 'Simon Kohl', 'Jan Philipp Radtke', 'Manuel Wiesenfarth', 'Lars Schimmöller', 'Tristan Anselm Kuder', 'Albrecht Stenzinger', 'Markus Hohenfellner', 'Heinz-Peter Schlemmer', 'Klaus Maier-Hein', 'David Bonekamp']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Magn Reson Imaging""","""['Radiomic Machine Learning for Characterization of Prostate Lesions with MRI: Comparison to ADC Values.', 'A radiomics machine learning-based redefining score robustly identifies clinically significant prostate cancer in equivocal PI-RADS score 3 lesions.', 'Contribution of Dynamic Contrast-enhanced and Diffusion MRI to PI-RADS for Detecting Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', 'Quantitative Prostate MRI.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Machine learning-based radiomics model to predict benign and malignant PI-RADS v2.1 category 3 lesions: a retrospective multi-center study.', 'Radiomics vs radiologist in prostate cancer.

Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDC-P) is a distinct histologic entity that is believed to represent retrograde spread of invasive acinar adenocarcinoma into prostatic ducts and acini. We have analyzed the impact of IDC-P in hormonal naïve and castration resistant metastatic prostate cancer patients.  Patients and methods:   We retrospectively evaluated 118 metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients who were initially diagnosed with distant metastases from May 2010 to September 2018. Group 1 patients included 81 metastatic PCa patients with acinar adenocarcinoma and Group 2 included 37 metastatic PCa patients with IDC-P.  Results:   Mean age at presentation was 76 years (IQR 73.4-78.7) in group 1 and 74 years (68.5-80.6) in group 2. Mean PSA at diagnosis was 619 ng/mL (IQR 85-1113) and 868 ng/mL (IQR 186-1922), respectively. Time to castration resistance was 24.7 months (IQR 16.7-32.7) in group 1 and 10.2 months (IQR 4.2-16.2) in group 2 (P = .007). Time to progression in CPRC patients was: 10.6 months (IQR 5.6-15.6) and at 6.2 months (3.2-9.2), respectively (P = .05). Overall survival was 57.9 months in group 1(CI 95% 56.4-59.5) and 38 months (CI 95% 19.9-48.06) in group 2 (P = .001). In the multivariate analysis, adenocarcinoma subtype was statistically significant P .014, CI 95% (HR 0.058, 0.006-0.56) CONCLUSIONS: IDC-P seems to be a subtype of prostate cancer that is associated with a shorter response to hormonal treatment when compared to acinar adenocarcinoma in metastatic patients. New drugs in CRPC scenario as abiraterone and enzalutamide also obtained less response in IDC-P patients. Once IDC-P is identified, clinicians could extrapolate the relative poor response to hormonal therapy.

Results and limitations:   The median annual hospital volume was 19 RPs (interquartile range 1-40) in the overall cohort. MIS was associated with better outcomes than ORP. Greater hospital volume was correlated with shorter LOS (p < 0.001), high SI scores (SI3: p < 0.001; SI4: p < 0.001), and 30-d (p < 0.001) and 90-d readmission rates (p < 0.001). Incidence rates for SI3 and SI4 scores, and 30-d and 90-d readmission were 12.8 %, 5.8 %, 29.8 %, and 35.4 % in very low-volume centres (<10 annual cases) compared with 8.1 %, 1.9 %, 18.1 %, and 23.9 %, respectively, in other centres (all p < 0.001). Hospital volume was an independent risk factor for all outcomes after taking into account age, lymph node dissection, year of surgery, and surgical approach (ORP vs MIS). The main limitation is the lack of post-RP oncological and functional data.  Conclusions:   This nationwide analysis of RP procedures shows a significant correlation between hospital volume and postoperative outcomes irrespective of the surgical approach. Very low case volume (<10 annual procedures per centre) is associated with the highest risk of complications, readmission, and prolonged LOS. Greater hospital volume is directly correlated with shorter LOS even beyond this threshold.  Patient summary:   In this study we analysed the French nationwide database for removal of the prostate for prostate cancer. We found that the number of these cases that a hospital carries out per year was associated with outcomes after surgery, with better outcomes for higher annual case numbers.""","""['Guillaume Ploussard', 'Annabelle Grabia', 'Jean-Baptiste Beauval', 'Romain Mathieu', 'Laurent Brureau', 'François Rozet', 'Morgan Rouprêt', 'Charles-Edouard Lequeu;Comité de Cancérologie de l’Association Française d’Urologie']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Annual nationwide analysis of costs and post-operative outcomes after radical prostatectomy according to the surgical approach (open, laparoscopic, and robotic).', 'A 5-Year Contemporary Nationwide Evolution of the Radical Prostatectomy Landscape.', 'Patterns-of-care and health economic analysis of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in the Australian public health system.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'A Systematic Review of the Impact of Surgeon and Hospital Caseload Volume on Oncological and Nononcological Outcomes After Radical Prostatectomy for Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer.', ""Robotic-assisted surgery for\xa0prostatectomy - does the diffusion of robotic systems contribute to treatment centralization and influence patients' hospital choice?"", 'Radical prostatectomy versus external beam radiotherapy with androgen deprivation therapy for high-risk prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Same-day-discharge Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: An Annual Countrywide Analysis.', 'Annual nationwide analysis of costs and post-operative outcomes after radical prostatectomy according to the surgical approach (open, laparoscopic, and robotic).', 'A 5-Year Contemporary Nationwide Evolution of the Radical Prostatectomy Landscape.']"""

However, the prognostic value for men treated with radiation therapy is uncertain, with prior studies utilising old techniques and doses. We aimed to validate the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) groupings for men treated with contemporary radiation therapy.  Methods:   Men with localised prostate cancer treated with image-guided, dose-escalated (≥78 Gy) external beam radiation were identified across four institutions. Primary outcome was time to biochemical failure. Harrell's C index assessed performance of the ISUP system against other grading stratifications.  Results:   2205 men were included, withmedian follow-up of 5.6 years. Seven-year actuarial rates of biochemical failure for grade groups 1-5 were 9.3%, 10.4%, 13.2%, 12.4% and 23.4%. On multivariate analysis, hazard ratios for biochemical failure were1.19, 1.00, 1.10, 1.05 and 2.10 for grade groups 1-5, relative to 2. P values were only significant for grade group 5. Harrell's C index favoured an alternative three group model (comprising Gleason scores [6 and 3 + 4 = 7] vs [4 + 3 = 7 and 8] vs [9 and 10]) over ISUP grade groups.  Conclusions:   The ISUP grade groups were not validated in a contemporary cohort treated with dose-escalated, image-guided radiation therapy. Grade groups 1-4 were not statistically different from each other; however, grade group 5 had a significantly worse prognosis. We identified a new three group model that better predicted biochemical outcomes. Further work is requiredto validate optimal groupings for modern radiation therapy and investigate the contrasting prognostic capability of grade groups in surgical and radiation therapy patients.""","""['Jonathan Toby', 'Thomas Eade', 'George Hruby', 'Andrew Kneebone', 'Noel Aherne', 'Chris Brown', 'Lesley Guo', 'Matthew Hoffmann', 'Thomas P Shakespeare']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Predictive value of the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology grading system for prostate cancer in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy with long-term follow-up.', 'Biparametric Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version2 and International Society of Urological Pathology Grade Predict Biochemical Recurrence after Radical\xa0Prostatectomy.', 'Clinical significance and risk factors of International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade upgrading in prostate cancer patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'Bone health assessment with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry in men with high-risk prostate carcinoma commencing adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy.']"""

However, relative SM probabilities following treatment with contemporary radiation techniques such as stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) or moderately hypofractionated intensity modulated radiotherapy (HF-IMRT) remain unknown.  Methods:   A cohort analysis was performed of men from a nationally representative database with localized prostate cancer with at least 60 months of follow-up comparing SM probability amongst men receiving either radical prostatectomy (RP), conventionally fractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy (CF-IMRT), HF-IMRT, brachytherapy (BT), or SBRT, using multivariable logistic models, which were used to generate predicted probabilities. Additionally, propensity score-adjusted pairwise assessments of modalities were performed.  Results:   For 303,432 patients included in the study, median follow-up was 9.08 years (IQR 7.01-11.21). Predicted rates of SM by treatment modality and adjusted odds ratios (AOR) for development of SM (referent: RP) were: 6.0% for RP (AOR n/a), 7.1% for CF-IMRT (AOR 1.20, 95%CI 1.14-1.25, P < 0.001), 7.3% for HF-IMRT (AOR 1.25, 95%CI 1.01-1.55, P = 0.045), 6.6% for BT (AOR 1.11, 95%CI 1.07-1.16, P < 0.001), and 5.7% for SBRT (AOR 0.95, 95%CI 0.81-1.12, P = 0.567). On propensity score-adjusted analysis, SBRT was associated with lower odds of SM compared to CF-IMRT (AOR 0.78, 95%CI 0.66-0.93, P = 0.005); no significant difference was found when SBRT was compared to RP (AOR 0.86, 95%CI 0.73-1.03, P = 0.102).  Conclusions:   Conventionally fractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy, moderately hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy, and brachytherapy but not stereotactic body radiotherapy were associated with increased probability of a second malignancy compared to radical prostatectomy. Patients treated with SBRT may be at lower risk of second malignancy due to improved conformality, radiobiological differences or patient selection. The possibility that SBRT in select patients may minimize the probability of SM underscores the need for assessment of second malignancy risk in prospective studies of SBRT.""","""['Edward Christopher Dee', 'Vinayak Muralidhar', 'Martin T King', 'Neil E Martin', ""Anthony V D'Amico"", 'Kent W Mouw', 'Peter F Orio', 'Paul L Nguyen', 'Jonathan E Leeman']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Second malignancy (SM) in prostate cancer patients treated with SBRT and other contemporary radiation techniques.', 'Second malignancy probabilities in prostate cancer patients treated with SBRT and other contemporary radiation techniques: Reply.', 'Secondary cancers after intensity-modulated radiotherapy, brachytherapy and radical prostatectomy for the treatment of prostate cancer: incidence and cause-specific survival outcomes according to the initial treatment intervention.', 'Use, complications, and costs of stereotactic body radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Commentary on ""secondary cancers after intensity-modulated radiotherapy, brachytherapy, and radical prostatectomy for the treatment of prostate cancer: incidence and cause-specific survival outcomes according to the initial treatment intervention.""

Interleukin (IL)-6 promotes proliferation and neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) of androgen dependent LNCaP cells. We treated LNCaP cells with IL-6 and observed for in vitro NED of cells and also expression of NE markers βIII tubulin, neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and chromogranin A (ChA). Here we investigated the proteins and/or pathways involved in NED of LNCaP cells induced by IL-6 and characterized their role in NED of PCa cells. We found that the altered proteins modulated AMPK signaling pathway in NE cells. Remarkably, IL-6 induces NED of LNCaP cells through activation of AMPK and SIRT1 and also both of these are co-regulated while playing a predominant role in NED of LNCaP cells. Of the few requirements of AMPK-SIRT1 activation, increased eNOS is essential for NED by elevating Nitric oxide (NO) levels. Pleiotropic effects of NO ultimately regulate p38MAPK in IL-6 induced NED. Hence, IL-6 induced AMPK-SIRT1 activation eventually transfers its activation signals through p38MAPK for advancing NED of LNCaP cells. Moreover, inactivation of p38MAPK with specific inhibitor (SB203580) attenuated IL-6 induced NED of LNCaP cells. Therefore, IL-6 promotes NED of PCa cells via AMPK/SIRT1/p38MAPK signaling. Finally, targeting AMPK-SIRT1 or p38MAPK in androgen independent PC3 cells with neuroendocrine features reversed their neuroendocrine characteristics. Taken together these novel findings reveal that targeting p38MAPK mitigated NED of PCa cells, and thus it can be a favorable target to overcome progression of NEPC.""","""['Sirisha Natani', 'Vishnu M Dhople', 'Asha Parveen', 'K K Sruthi', 'Priyanka Khilar', 'Supriya Bhukya', 'Ramesh Ummanni']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Res""","""['Activation of TGF-β - SMAD2 signaling by IL-6 drives neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer through p38MAPK.', 'Autophagy pathway is required for IL-6 induced neuroendocrine differentiation and chemoresistance of prostate cancer LNCaP cells.', 'Interleukin-6 induces neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) through suppression of RE-1 silencing transcription factor (REST).', 'Interleukin-6 regulates androgen receptor activity and prostate cancer cell growth.', 'Neuroendocrine differentiation in the progression of prostate cancer.', 'World Trade Center dust exposure promotes cancer in PTEN-deficient mouse prostates.']"""

Risk of histologic findings in initial TRUS-biopsies categorized as non-malignant, insignificant PCa, or significant PCa (csPCa).

Results and limitations:   After exclusions, our cohort included 39,886 men. The diagnostic hit rate for csPCa was 40.8 %. Men with PSA > 20 ng/mL and ≥cT2 harbor a risk >75% for finding csPCa in the first TRUS biopsy-set. Men with cT1 tumors and PSA < 20 ng/mL have a risk of non-malignant histology of at least 58%. Limitations include the high number of exclusions based on missing information.  Conclusion:   The diagnostic accuracy of systematic TRUS-biopsies is high for men with palpable tumors and high PSA.

In patient serum samples, miR-143 expression was also significantly upregulated after ADT+ZQE treatment, which was however absent in patients treated with ADT only. In DU145 cells, ZQD treatment led to a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis, which could be reduced by anti-miR-143 treatment. There was a binding site between miR-143 and B cell CLL/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and ZQD treatment reduced Bcl-2 expression. ZQD treatment led to increased caspase-3 and Bax expression.

Like other members of the pinnatoxin family, it has been shown to have its effects via antagonism of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, with preferential binding to the α7 subunit often upregulated in cancer. Because increased activity of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors contributes to increased growth and resistance to apoptosis, the effect of pinnatoxin G on cancer cell viability was tested. In a panel of six cancer cell lines, all cell types lost viability, but HT29 colon cancer and LN18 and U373 glioma cell lines were more sensitive than MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, PC3 prostate cancer cells, and U87 glioma cells, correlating with expression levels of α7, α4, and α9 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Some loss of cell viability could be attributed to cell cycle arrest, but significant levels of classical apoptosis were found, characterized by caspase activity, phosphatidylserine exposure, mitochondrial membrane permeability, and fragmented DNA. Intracellular Ca2+ levels also dropped immediately upon pinnatoxin G treatment, which may relate to antagonism of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-mediated Ca2+ inflow.

Little prospective data existed to guide practice, and professional surgical societies issued recommendations grounded mainly in common sense and expert consensus, such as medical therapy for early-stage breast and prostate cancer patients. To understand the patient experience of delay in cancer surgery during the pandemic, we interviewed breast and prostate cancer patients whose surgeries were delayed due to the pandemic.  Patients and methods:   Patients with early-stage breast or prostate cancer who suffered surgical postponement at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) were invited to participate. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 21 breast and prostate cancer patients. Interviews were transcribed, and qualitative analysis using ground-theory approach was performed.  Results:   Most patients reported significant distress due to cancer and COVID. Key themes that emerged included the lack of surprise and acceptance of the surgical delays but endorsed persistent cancer- and delay-related worries. Satisfaction with patient-physician communication and the availability of a delay strategy were key factors in patients' acceptance of the situation; perceived lack of communication prompted a few patients to seek care elsewhere.  Discussion:   The clinical effect of delay in cancer surgery will take years to fully understand, but there are immediate steps that can be taken to improve the patient experience of delays in care, including elicitation of individual patient perspectives and ongoing communication. More work is needed to understand the wider experiences of patients, especially minority, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and uninsured patients, who encounter delays in oncologic care.""","""['Claire Sokas', 'Masami Kelly', 'Christina Sheu', 'Julia Song', 'H Gilbert Welch', 'Regan Bergmark', 'Christina Minami', 'Quoc-Dien Trinh']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Ann Surg Oncol""","""['ASO Author Reflections: How We Convey Empathy, Address Uncertainty, and Share Serious News: Challenges to Remote Surgical Care.', 'Management of patients who opt for radical prostatectomy during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: an international accelerated consensus statement.', 'A Reminder of Skin Cancer During the COVID-19 Pandemic.', 'Delayed Radical Prostatectomy is Not Associated with Adverse Oncologic Outcomes: Implications for Men Experiencing Surgical Delay Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.', 'COVID-19 impact on timing of brachytherapy treatment and strategies for risk mitigation.', 'Assessing the Burden of Nondeferrable Major Uro-oncologic Surgery to Guide Prioritisation Strategies During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Insights from Three Italian High-volume Referral Centres.', 'Psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on breast cancer patients.', 'Patient reported experiences of Swedish patients being investigated for cancer during the Covid-19 pandemic.', 'Patient-reported experiences of cancer care related to the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland.', ""Patients' experiences undergoing cancer surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study."", 'Stressors related to the COVID-19 pandemic and their association with distress, depressive, and anxiety symptoms in cancer out-patients.']"""

Methods: 64Cu-PSMA-BCH was prepared and investigated for stability, PSMA specificity, and micro-PET imaging. With the approval of Ethics Committee of Beijing Cancer Hospital (No. 2017KT97), PET/CT imaging in 4 patients with suspected prostate cancer was performed and the radiation dosimetry was estimated. Then, PSMA PET-ultrasound image-guided biopsies were performed on 3 patients and the fine needle aspirates were further performed for autoradiography and immunohistochemistry analysis.  Results: 64Cu-PSMA-BCH was prepared with high radiochemical yield and stability. In vivo study showed higher uptake in PSMA ( +) 22Rv1 cells than PSMA ( -) PC-3 cells (5.59 ± 0.36 and 1.97 ± 0.22 IA%/106 cells at 1 h). It accumulated in 22Rv1 tumor with increasing radioactivity uptake and T/N ratios from 1 to 24 h post-injection. In patients with suspected prostate cancer, SUVmax and T/N ratios increased within 24 h post-injection. Compared with image at 1 h post-injection, more tumor lesions were detected at 6 h and 24 h post-injection. The human organ radiation dosimetry showed gallbladder wall was most critical, liver and kidneys were followed, and the whole-body effective dose was 0.0292 mSv/MBq. Two fine needle aspirates obtained by PET-ultrasound-guided targeted biopsy showed high radioactive signal by autoradiography, with 100% PSMA expression in cytoplasm and 30% expression in nucleus.  Conclusion: 64Cu-PSMA-BCH was PSMA specific and showed high stability in vivo with lower uptake in liver than 64Cu-PSMA-617. Biodistribution in mice and PCa patients showed similar profile compared with other PSMA ligands and it was safe with moderate effective dosimetry. The increased tumor uptake and T/N ratios by delayed imaging may facilitate the detection of small lesions and guiding targeted biopsies.""","""['Teli Liu#', 'Chen Liu#', 'Zhongyi Zhang#', 'Ning Zhang', 'Xiaoyi Guo', 'Lei Xia', 'Jinquan Jiang', 'Qing Xie', 'Kun Yan', 'Steven P Rowe', 'Hua Zhu', 'Zhi Yang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Preclinical Evaluation and Pilot Clinical Study of Al18F-PSMA-BCH for Prostate Cancer PET Imaging.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Development of Novel PSMA Ligands for Imaging and Therapy with Copper Isotopes.', 'PET/CT With 68Ga-PSMA in Prostate Cancer: Radiopharmaceutical Background and Clinical Implications.', ""64Cu-1,4,7,10-Tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid-anti-prostate-specific membrane antigen 3/A12 monoclonal antibody."", '64Cu-DOTHA2-PSMA, a Novel PSMA PET Radiotracer for Prostate Cancer with a Long Imaging Time Window.', 'State-of-the-art of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging in China: after the first 66\xa0years (1956-2022).', 'An Albumin-Binding PSMA Ligand with Higher Tumor Accumulation for PET Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', '18F-PFPN PET: A New and Attractive Imaging Modality for Patients with Malignant Melanoma.', 'Single-Center Comparison of 64Cu-DOTAGA-PSMA and 18F-PSMA PET-CT for Imaging Prostate Cancer.']"""

Recent evidence of tumor cell metabolism, however, shows that some tumors also increase mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (ox-phos) at some disease states during progression and/or development of drug resistance. Our data show that anti-androgen enzalutamide (ENZA) resistant prostate cancer (PCa) cells use more mitochondrial metabolism leading to higher ox-phos as compared to the ENZA-sensitive cells and can become vulnerable to mitochondrial metabolism targeted therapies.  Methods:   Seahorse assay, mass spectrometry and high resolution fluorescence confocal microscopy coupled with image analysis has been used to compare mitochondrial metabolism in ENZA-treated and -untreated anti-androgen-sensitive LNCaP and -resistant C4-2, CWR22ν1, and PCa2b cells. Ex vivo fluorescence microscopy and image analysis has been standardized to monitor mitochondrial electron transport (ETS) activity that likely increases ox-phos in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) isolated fom patients undergoing AR-targeted therapies.  Results:   Our data show that PCa cells that are resistant to anti-androgen ENZA switch from glycolysis to ox-phos leading to an increased ETS activity. ENZA pretreated cells are more vulnerable to ETS component complex I inhibitor IACS-010759 (IACS) and mitochondrial glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 that reduces glutamate supply to tricarboxylic acid cycle. CTCs isolated from 6 of 20 patient blood samples showed relatively higher ETS activity than the rest of the patients. All six patients have developed ENZA resistance within less than 6 months of the sample collection.  Conclusion:   The enhanced growth inhibitory effects of mitochondrial metabolic inhibitors IACS and CB-839 in ENZA pretreated PCa cells provides a rationale for designing a drug combination trial. Patients can be selected for such trials by monitoring the mitochondrial ETS activities in their CTCs to maximize success.""","""['Hirak S Basu', 'Nathaniel Wilganowski', 'Samantha Robertson', 'James M Reuben', 'Evan N Cohen', 'Amado Zurita', 'Sumankalai Ramachandran', 'Lian-Chun Xiao', 'Mark Titus', 'George Wilding']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Enhanced radiosensitization of enzalutamide via schedule dependent administration to androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells.', 'Influence of abiraterone and enzalutamide on body composition in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Isolation and characterization of castration-resistant prostate cancer LNCaP95 clones.', 'Enzalutamide as a second generation antiandrogen for treatment of advanced prostate cancer.', 'Darolutamide as a Second-Generation Androgen Receptor Inhibitor in the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'The emerging roles and mechanism of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications in urologic tumours progression.', 'Identification of key enzalutamide-resistance-related genes in castration-resistant prostate cancer and verification of RAD51 functions.', 'Mitoribosome sensitivity to HSP70 inhibition uncovers metabolic liabilities of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'M6A-modified circRBM33 promotes prostate cancer progression via PDHA1-mediated mitochondrial respiration regulation and presents a potential target for ARSI therapy.', 'Mitochondrial Alterations in Prostate Cancer: Roles in Pathobiology and Racial Disparities.']"""

Risk calculators (RC) have been developed to mitigate these issues. Contemporary RCs integrate clinical characteristics with mpMRI findings.  Objective:   To validate two of these models-the MRI-ERSPC-RC-3/4 and the risk model of van Leeuwen.  Methods:   265 men with clinical suspicion of PC were enrolled. Every patient received a prebiopsy mpMRI, which was reported according to PI-RADS v2.1, followed by MRI/TRUS fusion-biopsy. Cancers with ISUP grade ≥ 2 were classified as sPC.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Statistical analysis was performed by comparing discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility RESULTS: There was no significant difference in discrimination between the RCs. The MRI-ERSPC-RC-3/4-RC showed a nearly ideal calibration-slope (0.94; 95% CI 0.68-1.20) than the van Leeuwen model (0.70; 95% CI 0.52-0.88). Within a threshold range up to 9% for a sPC, the MRI-ERSPC-RC-3/4-RC shows a greater net benefit than the van Leeuwen model. From 10 to 15%, the van Leeuwen model showed a higher net benefit compared to the MRI-ERSP-3/4-RC. For a risk threshold of 15%, the van Leeuwen model would avoid 24% vs. 14% compared to the MRI-ERSPC-RC-3/4 model; 6% vs. 5% sPC would be overlooked, respectively.  Conclusion:   Both risk models supply accurate results and reduce the number of biopsies and basically no sPC were overlooked. The van Leeuwen model suggests a better balance between unnecessary biopsies and overlooked sPC at thresholds range of 10-15%.

We investigated associations between diabetes and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and metastases in obese and nonobese men undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP).  Methods:   We included 4688 men from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital cohort of men undergoing RP from 1988 to 2017. Diabetes prior to RP, anthropometric, and clinical data were abstracted from 6 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers electronic medical records. Primary and secondary outcomes were PCSM and metastases and CRPC, respectively. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (adj-HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for diabetes and PCSM, CRPC, and metastases. Adjusted hazard ratios were also estimated in analyses stratified by obesity (body mass index: nonobese <30 kg/m2; obese ≥30 kg/m2). All statistical tests were 2-sided.  Results:   Diabetes was not associated with PCSM (adj-HR = 1.38, 95% CI = 0.86 to 2.24), CRPC (adj-HR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.67 to 1.64), or metastases (adj-HR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.70 to 1.46), among all men. Interaction terms for diabetes and obesity were statistically significant in multivariable models for PCSM, CRPC, and metastases (P ≤ .04). In stratified analyses, in obese men, diabetes was associated with PCSM (adj-HR = 3.06, 95% CI = 1.40 to 6.69), CRPC (adj-HR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.11 to 4.15), and metastases (adj-HR = 1.57, 95% CI = 0.88 to 2.78), though not statistically significant for metastases. In nonobese men, inverse associations were suggested for diabetes and prostate cancer outcomes without reaching statistical significance.

Data were retrieved from 10-year electronic medical records at Kyushu University Hospital (Japan) for patients aged 20 to 69 years old. The associations of baseline bilirubin levels with cancer risk (lung, colon, breast, prostate, and cervical) were evaluated using a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) model, a machine learning algorithm, and Cox proportional hazard regression model, adjusted for age, smoking, body mass index, and diabetes. The number of study subjects was 29,080. Median follow-up time was 4.7 years. GBDT models illustrated that baseline bilirubin levels were negatively and non-linearly associated with the risk of lung (men), colon, and cervical cancer. In contrast, a U-shaped association was observed for breast and prostate cancer. Cox hazard regression analyses confirmed that baseline bilirubin levels (< 1.2 mg/dL) were negatively associated with lung cancer risk in men (HR = 0.474, 95% CI 0.271-0.828, P = 0.009) and cervical cancer risk (HR = 0.365, 95% CI 0.136-0.977, P = 0.045). Additionally, low bilirubin levels (< 0.6 mg/dL) were associated with total death (HR = 1.744, 95% CI 1.369-2.222, P < 0.001).

Experimental design:   We selected PD-L1-positive high-grade and/or high-risk primary prostate cancer, characterized tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes with multiplex immunofluorescence, and identified genomic alterations in immunogenic and nonimmunogenic tumor foci.  Results:   One quarter of aggressive localized prostate cancer cases (29/115) had tumor PD-L1 expression more than 5%. This correlated with increased density of CD8+ T cells, a large fraction coexpressing PD-1, versus absent PD-1 expression on sparse CD8 T cells in unselected cases. Most CD8+PD-1+ cells did not express terminal exhaustion markers (TIM3 or LAG3), while a subset expressed TCF1. Consistent with these CD8+PD-1+TCF1+ cells being progenitors, they were found in antigen-presenting cell niches in close proximity to MHC-II+ cells. CD8 T-cell density in immunogenic prostate cancer and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) was nearly identical. Shallow RB1 and BRCA2 losses, and deep deletions of CHD1, were prevalent, the latter being strongly associated with a dendritic cell gene set in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Tumor mutation burden was variable; neither high microsatellite instability nor CDK12 alterations were present.  Conclusions:   A subset of localized prostate cancer is immunogenic, manifested by PD-L1 expression and CD8+ T-cell content comparable with RCC. The CD8+ T cells include effector cells and exhausted progenitor cells, which may be expanded by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Genomic losses of RB1, BRCA2, and CHD1 may be drivers of this phenotype.

The molecular mechanisms controlling AR activation in general and AR reactivation in CRPC remain elusive. Here we report that monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), a mitochondrial enzyme that degrades monoamine neurotransmitters and dietary amines, reciprocally interacts with AR in prostate cancer. MAOA was induced by androgens through direct AR binding to a novel intronic androgen response element of the MAOA gene, which in turn promoted AR transcriptional activity via upregulation of Shh/Gli-YAP1 signaling to enhance nuclear YAP1-AR interactions. Silencing MAOA suppressed AR-mediated prostate cancer development and growth, including CRPC, in mice. MAOA expression was elevated and positively associated with AR and YAP1 in human CRPC. Finally, genetic or pharmacologic targeting of MAOA enhanced the growth-inhibition efficacy of enzalutamide, darolutamide, and apalutamide in both androgen-dependent and CRPC cells. Collectively, these findings identify and characterize an MAOA-AR reciprocal regulatory circuit with coamplified effects in prostate cancer. Moreover, they suggest that cotargeting this complex may be a viable therapeutic strategy to treat prostate cancer and CRPC. SIGNIFICANCE: MAOA and AR comprise a positive feedback loop in androgen-dependent and CRPC, providing a mechanistic rationale for combining MAOA inhibition with AR-targeted therapies for prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Jing Wei', 'Lijuan Yin', 'Jingjing Li', 'Jing Wang', 'Tianjie Pu', 'Peng Duan', 'Tzu-Ping Lin', 'Allen C Gao', 'Boyang Jason Wu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Uro-Science.', 'Effect of Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) inhibitors on androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Loss of a Negative Feedback Loop between IRF8 and AR Promotes Prostate Cancer Growth and Enzalutamide Resistance.', 'Epigenetic Reprogramming with Antisense Oligonucleotides Enhances the Effectiveness of Androgen Receptor Inhibition in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor: what we know and what we expect in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Monoamine oxidase A: An emerging therapeutic target in prostate cancer.', 'Pueraria lobata Potentially Treating Prostate Cancer on Single-Cell Level by Network Pharmacology and AutoDock: Clinical Findings and Drug Targets.', 'AR-regulated ZIC5 contributes to the aggressiveness of prostate cancer.', 'Tumor-Promoting ATAD2 and Its Preclinical Challenges.', 'Bone-targeted nanoplatform enables efficient modulation of bone tumor microenvironment for prostate cancer bone metastasis treatment.']"""

Metformin may act synergistically with standard prostate cancer therapies. However, there is still a debate about the effect of metformin on hormone sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC).  Patients and methods:   randomized controlled trial. Eligible patients were high risk locally advanced or metastatic HSPC. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either metformin plus standard of care or standard of care alone. The primary endpoint was castration-resistant prostate cancer-free survival (CRPC-FS). The secondary endpoints were overall survival, PSA level and adverse events.  Results:   A total number of 124 patients underwent randomization where 62 patients were allocated in each arm. Over a median follow up of 22 months, the CRPC-FS was significantly improved with metformin (29 months, 95% CI 25-33 vs. 20 months 95% CI 16-24; P = 0.01). After subgroup analysis, the addition of metformin improved the CRPC-FS in patients with high risk localized disease (median not reached vs. 25 months, 95% CI 18-31; P = 0.02) and in patients with metastatic low tumor volume disease (median not reached vs. 15 months, 95% CI 5-25; P = 0.009). No significant difference in overall survival or PSA response in both treatment arms (P = 0.1 and 0.5, respectively). Metformin was not associated with significant adverse events apart from grade II diarrhea.  Conclusion:   Metformin is a safe and low-cost drug.

Although previous studies have combined Prostate Imaging-Reporting & Data System (PI-RADS)-based MRI findings with routinely available clinical variables and with deep learning-based imaging predictors, respectively, for prostate cancer risk stratification, none have combined all three. We aimed to construct an integrated nomogram (referred to as ClaD) combining deep learning-based imaging predictions, PI-RADS scoring, and clinical variables to identify clinically significant prostate cancer on biparametric MRI.  Methods:   In this retrospective multicentre study, we included patients with prostate cancer, with histopathology or biopsy reports and a screening or diagnostic MRI scan in the axial view, from four cohorts in the USA (from University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Cleveland Clinic, and Long Island Jewish Medical Center) and from the PROSTATEx Challenge dataset in the Netherlands. We constructed an integrated nomogram combining deep learning, PI-RADS score, and clinical variables (prostate-specific antigen, prostate volume, and lesion volume) using multivariable logistic regression to identify clinically significant prostate cancer on biparametric MRI. We used data from the first three cohorts to train the nomogram and data from the remaining two cohorts for independent validation. We compared the performance of our ClaD integrated nomogram with that of integrated nomograms combining clinical variables with either the deep learning-based imaging predictor (referred to as DIN) or PI-RADS score (referred to as PIN) using area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs). We also compared the ability of the nomograms to predict biochemical recurrence on a subset of patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy. We report cross-validation AUCs as means for the training set and used AUCs with 95% CIs to assess the performance on the test set. The difference in AUCs between the models were tested for statistical significance using DeLong's test. We used log-rank tests and Kaplan-Meier curves to analyse survival.  Findings:   We investigated 592 patients (823 lesions) with prostate cancer who underwent 3T multiparametric MRI at five hospitals in the USA between Jan 8, 2009, and June 3, 2017. The training data set consisted of 368 patients from three sites (the PROSTATEx Challenge cohort [n=204], University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center [n=126], and Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai [n=38]), and the independent validation data set consisted of 224 patients from two sites (Cleveland Clinic [n=151] and Long Island Jewish Medical Center [n=73]). The ClaD clinical nomogram yielded an AUC of 0·81 (95% CI 0·76-0·85) for identification of clinically significant prostate cancer in the validation data set, significantly improving performance over the DIN (0·74 [95% CI 0·69-0·80], p=0·0005) and PIN (0·76 [0·71-0·81], p<0·0001) nomograms. In the subset of patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy (n=81), the ClaD clinical nomogram resulted in a significant separation in Kaplan-Meier survival curves between patients with and without biochemical recurrence (HR 5·92 [2·34-15·00], p=0·044), whereas the DIN (1·22 [0·54-2·79], p=0·65) and PIN nomograms did not (1·30 [0·62-2·71], p=0·51).  Interpretation:   Risk stratification of patients with prostate cancer using the integrated ClaD nomogram could help to identify patients with prostate cancer who are at low risk, very low risk, and favourable intermediate risk, who might be candidates for active surveillance, and could also help to identify patients with lethal prostate cancer who might benefit from adjuvant therapy.

Methods:   427 patients with ISUP grade group 1 PCa who have undergone radical prostatectomy and BMI evaluation were included. The outcome of interest was the presence of UD (defined as ISUP grade group ≥3 and pT ≥3a), PSM, and BCR.  Results:   Statistically significant differences resulted in comparing BMI with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and serum testosterone levels (both p < 0.0001). Patients with UD and PSM had higher BMI values (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.006, respectively). BCR-free survival was significantly decreased in patients with higher BMI values (p < 0.0001). BMI was an independent risk factor for BCR and PSM.

Methods:   PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, Health Source Nursing Academic Edition, EMBASE, and Web of Sciences were searched until the date of July 25, 2020. The analysis included an assessment of the overall incidence of OSA malignancies, the incidence of OSA malignancies by age and gender, and the incidence of different types of malignancies in patients with OSA. The total rate and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) of the incidence of malignant tumors in patients with OSA were calculated. Patients with OSA were classified according to age, gender, and different types of malignant tumors for meta-analysis.  Results:   A total of 12 studies involving 862,820 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Random effect model analysis showed that the total incidence of malignant tumors in patients with OSA was 0.046% (95% CI: 0.027-0.065, P < 0.001), higher than that of malignant tumors in the general population. According to the analytical results classified by gender, the incidence of malignant tumor in female patients with OSA was 4.0% (95% CI: 0.014-0.066), higher than that in male patients at 3.5% (95% CI: 0.012-0.058). The analytical results classified by age showed that the incidence of malignant tumors in patients with OSA aged below 60 years was 1.8% (95% CI: 0.000-0.036), lower than that in patients aged above 60 years at 4.3% (95% CI: 0.002-0.084). The analytical results classified by the types of malignant tumors showed that the incidences of breast cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, kidney cancer, pancreatic cancer, and melanoma in patients with OSA were 0.5% (95% CI: 0.001-0.008), 0.5% (95% CI: 0.002-0.009), 0.5% (95% CI: 0.003-0.008), 1.1% (95% CI: 0.002-0.021), 0.3% (95% CI: 0.001-0.005), 0.1% (95% CI: 0.001-0.002), and 0.4% (95% CI: 0.003-0.005), respectively. Among them, the incidence of prostate cancer was the highest, followed by breast cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, melanoma, and kidney cancer, whereas the incidence of pancreatic cancer was the lowest. However, the incidence of specific malignant tumors in patients with OSA did not have a significant increase compared with that in the general population.  Conclusions:   The analytical results of this meta-analysis suggested that OSA may be associated with an overall increase in the incidence of malignancies based on the currently available data, but the connection with specific types of malignancies was not significant. Further studies are needed to explore this association in the future.""","""['Linjie Cheng', 'Hai Guo', 'Zhenlian Zhang', 'Yangyang Yao', 'Qiaoling Yao']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Sleep Med""","""['Highlighting the relationship between prostate cancer and obstructive sleep apnea: a comment on recent meta-analyses.', 'Investigation into the association between obstructive sleep apnea and incidence of all-type cancers: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Obstructive sleep apnoea and the incidence and mortality of cancer: a meta-analysis.', 'The association of obstructive sleep apnea with melanoma incidence and mortality: a meta-analysis of 5,276,451 patients.', 'Sleep Apnea and Cancer: Analysis of a Nationwide Population Sample.', 'Association between sleep-disordered breathing, obstructive sleep apnea, and cancer incidence: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Testicular Cancer Incidence among Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) Patients: South Korean National Health Insurance Data.', 'MiR-142-3p as an Indicator of OSA Severity Predicts Prognosis in Lung Adenocarcinoma with OSA.', 'Association Between Smoking Behavior and Obstructive Sleep Apnea: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'A cross-sectional study of obstructive sleep apnea in patients with colorectal cancer.', 'The Incidence of Cancer Is Increased in Hospitalized Adult Patients With Obstructive Sleep Apnea in China: A Retrospective Cohort Study.']"""

Binding function 3 (BF3) inhibitors with alternative modes of action have emerged as a promising approach to overcoming antiandrogen resistance. However, how these BF3 inhibitors modulate AR function remains elusive, hindering the development of BF3-targeting agents. Here, we performed an integrated computational study to interrogate the binding mechanism of several known BF3 inhibitors with ARs. Our results show that the inhibitory effect of the BF3 antagonists arises from their allosteric modulation of the activation function (AF2) site, which alters the dynamic coupling between the BF3 and AF2 sites as well as the AF2-coactivator (SRC2-3) interaction. Moreover, the per-residue binding energy analyses reveal the ""anchor"" role of the linker connecting the phenyl ring and benzimidazole/indole in these BF3 inhibitors. Furthermore, the allosteric driver-interacting residues are found to include both ""positive"", e.g., Phe673 and Asn833, and ""negative"" ones, e.g., Phe826, and the differential interactions with these residues provide an explanation why stronger binding does not necessarily result in higher inhibitory activities. Finally, our allosteric communication pathway analyses delineate how the allosteric signals triggered by BF3 binding are propagated to the AF2 pocket through multiple short- and/or long-ranged transmission pathways. Collectively, our combined computational study provides a comprehensive structural mechanism underlying how the selected set of BF3 inhibitors modulate AR function, which will help guide future development of BF3 antagonists.""","""['Xiaotian Kong', 'Enming Xing', 'Tony Zhuang', 'Pui-Kai Li', 'Xiaolin Cheng']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Chem Inf Model""","""['Targeting Binding Function-3 of the Androgen Receptor Blocks Its Co-Chaperone Interactions, Nuclear Translocation, and Activation.', 'Identification of a potent antiandrogen that targets the BF3 site of the androgen receptor and inhibits enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer.', 'In vitro and in silico studies of holothurin A on androgen receptor in prostate cancer.', 'Cheminformatics Driven Development of Novel Therapies for Drug Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Recent advances in allosteric androgen receptor inhibitors for the potential treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

The expression levels of endothelin receptors in prostate tissue from patients with localized PCa by immunohistochemistry, and those in LNCaP and PC3 cells were determined reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR (RT‑qPCR) and western blotting. Furthermore, the expression levels of ET‑1 were determined in LNCaP and PC3 cells by RT‑qPCR and western blotting. The ET‑1 receptor activation was evaluated by intracellular calcium measurement, the expression levels of AR and enzymes participating in steroidogenesis [cytochrome P450 family 11 subfamily A member 1 (CyP11A1), cytochrome P450 family 17 subfamily A member 1, aldo‑keto reductase family member C2 and 3β‑hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase 2 (3β HSD2)] were determined by western blotting and T concentration was determined by ELISA using PC3 cells. The present results revealed higher expression levels of endothelin A receptor (ETAR) in tissues obtained from samples of patients with PCa with a low Gleason Score. No changes were identified for endothelin B receptor (ETBR). PC3 cells expressed higher levels of ET‑1 and ETAR, while LNCaP cells exhibited higher expression levels of ETBR. Blocking of ETAR and endothelin B receptor decreased the expression levels of CyP11A1 and 3β HSD2 enzymes and AR in PC3 cells, as well as T secretion.

[223Ra]RaCl2 is the only clinically approved alpha particle-emitting drug, and it is used to treat castrate-resistant prostate cancer bone metastases, to which [223Ra]Ra2+ localizes. To specifically direct [223Ra]Ra2+ to non-osseous disease sites, chelation and conjugation to a cancer-targeting moiety is necessary. Although previous efforts to stably chelate [223Ra]Ra2+ for this purpose have had limited success, here we report a biologically stable radiocomplex with the 18-membered macrocyclic chelator macropa. Quantitative labeling of macropa with [223Ra]Ra2+ was accomplished within 5 min at room temperature with a radiolabeling efficiency of >95%, representing a significant advancement over conventional chelators such as DOTA and EDTA, which were unable to completely complex [223Ra]Ra2+ under these conditions. [223Ra][Ra(macropa)] was highly stable in human serum and exhibited dramatically reduced bone and spleen uptake in mice in comparison to bone-targeted [223Ra]RaCl2, signifying that [223Ra][Ra(macropa)] remains intact in vivo. Upon conjugation of macropa to a single amino acid β-alanine as well as to the prostate-specific membrane antigen-targeting peptide DUPA, both constructs retained high affinity for 223Ra, complexing >95% of Ra2+ in solution. Furthermore, [223Ra][Ra(macropa-β-alanine)] was rapidly cleared from mice and showed low 223Ra bone absorption, indicating that this conjugate is stable under biological conditions. Unexpectedly, this stability was lost upon conjugation of macropa to DUPA, which suggests a role of targeting vectors in complex stability in vivo for this system. Nonetheless, our successful demonstration of efficient radiolabeling of the β-alanine conjugate with 223Ra and its subsequent stability in vivo establishes for the first time the possibility of delivering [223Ra]Ra2+ to metastases outside of the bone using functionalized chelators, marking a significant expansion of the therapeutic utility of this radiometal in the clinic.""","""['Diane S Abou', 'Nikki A Thiele', 'Nicholas T Gutsche', 'Alexandria Villmer', 'Hanwen Zhang', 'Joshua J Woods', 'Kwamena E Baidoo', 'Freddy E Escorcia', 'Justin J Wilson', 'Daniel L J Thorek']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Chem Sci""","""['Advancing Chelation Strategies for Large Metal Ions for Nuclear Medicine Applications.', 'Evaluation of 134Ce/134La as a PET Imaging Theranostic Pair for 225Ac α-Radiotherapeutics.', 'An Eighteen-Membered Macrocyclic Ligand for Actinium-225 Targeted Alpha Therapy.', 'Radium-223 for the treatment of bone metastases in castration-resistant prostate cancer: when and why.', 'Treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases with radium-223 dichloride.', 'Optimizing the Safety and Efficacy of Bio-Radiopharmaceuticals for Cancer Therapy.', 'Evaluation of Candidate Theranostics for 227Th/89Zr Paired Radioimmunotherapy of Lymphoma.', 'Dual targeting with 224Ra/212Pb-conjugates for targeted alpha therapy of disseminated cancers: A conceptual approach.', 'The global status of research in prostate cancer bone metastasis: A bibliometric and visualized analysis.', 'H2BZmacropa-NCS: A Bifunctional Chelator for Actinium-225 Targeted Alpha Therapy.']"""

The present work demonstrates that MUC1-C induces PBRM1, ARID2, and BRD7 expression by the previously unrecognized E2F1-mediated activation of their respective promoters. The functional significance of the MUC1-C→PBAF pathway is supported by demonstrating involvement of MUC1-C in associating with nuclear PBAF and driving the NRF2 antioxidant gene transcriptome in PC cells. Mechanistically, MUC1-C forms a complex with NRF2 and PBRM1 on the NRF2 target SLC7A11 gene that encodes the xCT cystine-glutamate antiporter, increases chromatin accessibility and induces SLC7A11/xCT expression. We also show that MUC1-C and PBRM1 are necessary for induction of other NRF2 target genes, including G6PD and PGD that regulate the pentose phosphate pathway. Our results further demonstrate that MUC1-C integrates activation of PBRM1 with the regulation of antioxidant genes, ROS levels, pluripotency factor expression and the cancer stem cell (CSC) state.

It is largely unknown whether the restoration of functional PTEN may modulate the TME and improve the tumor's sensitivity to ICB therapy. Here, we demonstrate that mRNA delivery by polymeric nanoparticles can effectively induce expression of PTEN in Pten-mutated melanoma cells and Pten-null prostate cancer cells, which in turn induces autophagy and triggers cell death-associated immune activation via release of damage-associated molecular patterns. In vivo results illustrated that PTEN mRNA nanoparticles can reverse the immunosuppressive TME by promoting CD8+ T cell infiltration of the tumor tissue, enhancing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-12, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ, and reducing regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. The combination of PTEN mRNA nanoparticles with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, anti-programmed death-1 antibody, results in a highly potent antitumor effect in a subcutaneous model of Pten-mutated melanoma and an orthotopic model of Pten-null prostate cancer.

However, there are no standardized criteria for monitoring serial tumor marker measurements. Herein, we have developed a monitoring system for interpreting changes in tumor markers using overlapping 95% confidence intervals (CIs).  Methods:   Two-year data, including 117,289 results for 11 tumor markers in our laboratory, were analyzed. CI ranges for each tumor marker were set based on biological variation, and data were analyzed for each patient assessed at health check-ups and clinics, individually and overall.  Results:   The 95th percentile cut-offs for each tumor marker were much higher in the clinic group than in the health check-up group. In decreasing order, the percentages of results with no overlap in 95% CIs were thyroglobulin antigen, 14.9%; protein induced by vitamin K absence-II (PIVKA), 11.9%; and prostate-specific antigen, 9.8%. After correction using the reference interval, the percentages decreased to less than 5%, except for PIVKA (10.9%).  Conclusion:   We suggest that our monitoring system can serve as a criterion for the auto-verification of tumor markers.

Until now, no validation of STAR-CAP has been performed. We retrospectively analyzed data from our institutional database for 19 552 patients treated with RP between 1992 and 2015. We applied the STAR-CAP point assignment criteria to calculate total individual scores and then classified patients according to the STAR-CAP stage groups ranging from IA (lowest risk) to IIIC (highest risk). We evaluated biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival, metastasis-free survival (MFS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS) stratified by STAR-CAP stage groups over 10 yr, calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), and performed decision curve analyses to assess the ability of STAR-CAP to predict these outcomes after fitting the data from our single-institution data set. STAR-CAP performed well in stratifying individual survival outcomes for BCR-free survival, MFS, and CSS for each stage group in Kaplan-Meier analyses (p < 0.001 between groups). The AUC for prediction of BCR, metastasis, and CSM at 10 yr was 0.73, 0.84, and 0.75, respectively. Our findings validate the performance of STAR-CAP for European patients treated with RP.

This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of re-irradiation using stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). We hypothesized that patients with castrate-resistant PC (CRPC) would benefit less from local salvage.  Methods:   A prospective clinical database was reviewed to extract 30 consecutive patients treated with prostate re-irradiation. Gallium prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) ligand positron emission tomography was performed following prostate-specific antigen failure in all patients and biopsy was obtained in 18 patients (60%). Re-irradiation was either focal (n = 13) or whole-gland (n = 17). Endo-rectal balloons were used in twenty-two patients and hydrogel spacers in eight patients. The median prescription dose was 5 fractions of 6.5 (range: 6-8) Gray (Gy).  Results:   Median follow-up was 28 months. Failure occurred in 10 (out of 11) CRPC patients versus 6 (out of 19) castrate-sensitive patients (91% vs. 32%, p = 0.008) after a median of 13 and 23 months, respectively. Metastases occurred in 64% (n = 7) of CRPC patients versus 16% (n = 3) of castrate-sensitive patients (p = 0.007). Two patients experienced local in-field recurrence, thus local control was 93%. The 2 and 3-year recurrence-free survival were 84% and 79% for castrate-sensitive patients versus 18% and 9% for CRPC patients (p < 0.001), and 3-year metastasis-free survival was 90% versus 27% (p < 0.01) for castrate-sensitive and CRPC patients, respectively. Acute grade II and III genitourinary (GU) toxicity occurred in 27% and 3%, and late GU toxicity in 30% and 3%, respectively. No ≥ grade II acute gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity occurred, and only one patient (3%) developed late grade II toxicity.  Conclusions:   Early delivery of salvage SBRT for local recurrence is associated with excellent 3-year disease control and acceptable toxicity in the castrate-sensitive phenotype.

We compared a base model, a linear predictor calculated from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center postoperative nomogram (prostate-specific antigen, pathological tumour grade and stage), with the addition of surgical margin status to five additional models (base model plus surgical margin subclassifications) to evaluate enhancement in predictive accuracy. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to determine the clinical utility of parameters that enhanced predictive accuracy.  Results:   Among 2147 men, 205 had PSMs, and 231 developed BCR. Discrimination for the base model with addition of surgical margin status was high (c-index = 0.801) and not meaningfully improved by adding surgical margin subclassification in the full cohort. In analyses considering only men with PSMs (N = 55 with BCR), adding surgical margin subclassification to the base model increased discrimination for total length of all PSMs - alone or with maximum Gleason grade at the margin (c-index improvement = 0.717 to 0.752 and 0.753, respectively).

Patients were followed for 12 months after TULSA. Uroflowmetry, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and a comprehensive set of functional questionnaires including the Expanded Prostate cancer Index Composite-26, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and five-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function were obtained at baseline and every 3 months afterwards. MRI was obtained at baseline, and at 3 and 12 months after TULSA. Medication use before and after TULSA were recorded. Adverse events (AEs) were reported using the Clavien-Dindo classification.  Results:   A total of 10 men underwent TULSA with no severe AEs encountered. The baseline median (interquartile range [IQR]) age and prostate volume were 68 (63-72) years and 53 (45-66) mL, respectively. At baseline, six patients were moderately symptomatic and four patients severely symptomatic. Nine patients at baseline were on BPO medication. The median (IQR) improvement in the IPSS was 82%, from 17.5 (15.3-23.0) at baseline to 4.0 (2.3-6.3) at 12 months.

The potential for significant disparities exists in the setting of increased adoption of prostate MRI. We sought to assess temporal trends in the utilization of MRI before prostate biopsy in a nationally representative sample. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Using the SEER-Medicare linked database, we identified men undergoing prostate biopsy who had an MRI within 6 months of diagnosis of prostate cancer. Men were stratified according to whether they were biopsy naive or had undergone a prior negative prostate biopsy. RESULTS. We identified 82,483 men undergoing prostate biopsy in SEER-Medicare from 2008 to 2015 of whom 78,253 were biopsy naive and 4230 had a known prior negative biopsy. We found that the percentage of patients who received an MRI before biopsy has increased from 2008 to 2015 in biopsy-naive men (0.5-8.2%; p < .001), men with a prior negative biopsy (1.4-25.5%; p < .001), and overall (0.5-9.2%; p < .001). On multivariable modeling, the odds ratio (OR) of a patient undergoing an MRI before biopsy for Black men (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.3-0.5; p < .001) was half that of White men, and the OR of MRI before biopsy in men from the Northeast (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 2.8-4.3; p < .001) was more than three times that of men from the West.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is highly expressed in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Lutetium-177 (177Lu)-PSMA-617 is a radioligand therapy that delivers beta-particle radiation to PSMA-expressing cells and the surrounding microenvironment.  Methods:   We conducted an international, open-label, phase 3 trial evaluating 177Lu-PSMA-617 in patients who had metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with at least one androgen-receptor-pathway inhibitor and one or two taxane regimens and who had PSMA-positive gallium-68 (68Ga)-labeled PSMA-11 positron-emission tomographic-computed tomographic scans. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either 177Lu-PSMA-617 (7.4 GBq every 6 weeks for four to six cycles) plus protocol-permitted standard care or standard care alone. Protocol-permitted standard care excluded chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radium-223 (223Ra), and investigational drugs. The alternate primary end points were imaging-based progression-free survival and overall survival, which were powered for hazard ratios of 0.67 and 0.73, respectively. Key secondary end points were objective response, disease control, and time to symptomatic skeletal events. Adverse events during treatment were those occurring no more than 30 days after the last dose and before subsequent anticancer treatment.  Results:   From June 2018 to mid-October 2019, a total of 831 of 1179 screened patients underwent randomization. The baseline characteristics of the patients were balanced between the groups. The median follow-up was 20.9 months. 177Lu-PSMA-617 plus standard care significantly prolonged, as compared with standard care, both imaging-based progression-free survival (median, 8.7 vs. 3.4 months; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.40; 99.2% confidence interval [CI], 0.29 to 0.57; P<0.001) and overall survival (median, 15.3 vs. 11.3 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.74; P<0.001). All the key secondary end points significantly favored 177Lu-PSMA-617. The incidence of adverse events of grade 3 or above was higher with 177Lu-PSMA-617 than without (52.7% vs. 38.0%), but quality of life was not adversely affected.  Conclusions:   Radioligand therapy with 177Lu-PSMA-617 prolonged imaging-based progression-free survival and overall survival when added to standard care in patients with advanced PSMA-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

However, the molecular mechanism of PCGEM1 regulating OA progression has not been fully elucidated.  Methods:   Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) were isolated from synovium tissues of OA patients (OA-FLSs) and trauma donors (Normal-FLSs). The size and morphology of the isolated exosomes were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis. Protein levels were analyzed by western blotting. Expression levels of PCGEM1, microRNA-142-5p (miR-142-5p), runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) mRNA, and OA related genes were assessed by qRT-PCR. Cell proliferation, viability, and apoptosis were evaluated by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide or flow cytometry assays. The relationship between miR-142-5p and PCGEM1 or RUNX2 was verified by dual-luciferase reporter and/or RNA pull down assays.  Results:   PCGEM1 was overexpressed in OA cartilages and exosomes from OA-FLSs. Exosomal PCGEM1 from OA-FLSs facilitated IL-1β-induced apoptosis and cartilage matrix degradation in chondrocytes. MiR-142-5p was downregulated while RUNX2 was upregulated in OA cartilages. Exosomal PCGEM1 from OA-FLSs regulated RUNX2 expression by sponging miR-142-5p in IL-1β-induced chondrocytes. MiR-142-5p inhibitor offset exosomal PCGEM1 knockdown-mediated effects on the apoptosis and cartilage matrix degradation of IL-1β-induced chondrocytes. RUNX2 overexpression counteracted the suppressive effect of miR-142-5p mimic on apoptosis and cartilage matrix degradation of IL-1β-induced chondrocytes.

However, there exists limited consensus on which patients with a negative prostate mpMRI could avoid prostate biopsy.  Purpose:   To identify which patient could safely avoid prostate biopsy when the prostate mpMRI is negative, via a radiomics-based machine learning approach.  Study type:   Retrospective.  Subjects:   Three hundred thirty patients with negative prostate 3T mpMRI between January 2016 and December 2018 were included.  Field strength/sequence:   A 3.0 T/T2-weighted turbo spin echo (TSE) imaging (T2 WI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI).  Assessment:   The integrative machine learning (iML) model was trained to predict negative prostate biopsy results, utilizing both radiomics and clinical features. The final study cohort comprised 330 consecutive patients with negative mpMRI (PI-RADS < 3) who underwent systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided (TRUS) or MR-ultrasound fusion (MRUS) biopsy within 6 months. A secondary analysis of biopsy naïve subcohort (n = 227) was also conducted.  Statistical tests:   The Mann-Whitney U test and Chi-Squared test were utilized to evaluate the significance of difference of clinical features between prostate biopsy positive and negative groups. The model performance was validated using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) and measured by AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value (NPV).  Results:   Overall, 306/330 (NPV 92.7%) of the final study cohort patients had negative biopsies, and 207/227 (NPV 91.2%) of the biopsy naïve subcohort patients had negative biopsies. Our iML model achieved NPVs of 98.3% and 98.0% for the study cohort and subcohort, respectively, superior to prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD)-based risk assessment with NPVs of 94.9% and 93.9%, respectively.  Data conclusion:   The proposed iML model achieved high performance in predicting negative prostate biopsy results for patients with negative mpMRI. With improved NPVs, the proposed model can be used to stratify patients who in whom we might obviate biopsies, thus reducing the number of unnecessary biopsies.

Multivariate analyses were used to assess the factors influencing time to PSA progression and OS.  Results:   A total of 189 patients were included; median age = 69 years, median PSA = 155 ng/mL, 41(22%) had visceral metastasis. Median time to PSA progression was shorter for patients with NLR ≥4 (n = 37) compared to patients with NLR < 4 (n = 146); 11.3 and 18.3 months, respectively, P = .015. Patients with NLR ≥4 also had inferior median OS (23.9 vs 49.5 months, P = .001). On multivariate analysis, NLR ≥4 was not an independent factor for time to PSA progression. However, NLR ≥4 was an independent factor of inferior OS (HR: 2.75, 95% CI: 1.01-7.87, P = .047). Other independent factors predicting inferior OS included Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status ≥1, high-volume status, and Hb < 12.

An anthropomorphic pelvic phantom with unilateral and bilateral hip prostheses was used to simulate pelvic cancer patients with metal implants. The raw data obtained from phantom CT scanning were reconstructed with a regular filtered back projection (FBP) algorithm and then corrected with iMAR. The phantom without hip prosthesis was also scanned and used as a reference ground truth (GT). The CT images of three prostate and four sarcoma patients with unilateral hip prosthesis were also reconstructed by FBP and iMAR algorithm and compared. iMAR algorithm reduced the metal artifacts and the maximum WEPL deviation in phantom images from -19.1 to -0.4 mm. However, the CT numbers cannot be retrieved using iMAR for periprosthetic bone materials, eventually leading to a WEPL deviation of -3.6 mm. The use of iMAR improved large discrepancies in DVHs of PTVs and the gamma index between FBP and GT images but increased the difference in the bladder DVH for bilateral hip prostheses due to newly introduced artifacts. In the patient study, the discrepancies of dose distribution were small on iMAR images when compared with FBP images for most cases, except for two sarcoma cases where gamma analysis failed and dose coverage in 98% of the PTV maximally reduced due to large volume of dark metal artifacts. iMAR reduced the metal artifacts and improved dose distribution accuracy in carbon ion radiotherapy for pelvic cancer. However, the residual and newly introduced artifacts, especially with bilateral hip prostheses, may potentially increase WEPL inaccuracy and dose uncertainty. The use of iMAR has the potential to improve carbon ion treatment planning of pelvic cancer but should be used with caution.""","""['Jingfang Zhao', 'Weiwei Wang', 'Kambiz Shahnaz', 'Xianwei Wu', 'Jingfang Mao', 'Ping Li', 'Qing Zhang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Clinical evaluation of the iterative metal artifact reduction algorithm for CT simulation in radiotherapy.', 'Metal Artifact Reduction in Pelvic Computed Tomography With Hip Prostheses: Comparison of Virtual Monoenergetic Extrapolations From Dual-Energy Computed Tomography and an Iterative Metal Artifact Reduction Algorithm in a Phantom Study.', 'Metal Artifact Reduction of CT Scans to Improve PET/CT.', 'Metallic artifact reduction by evaluation of the additional value of iterative reconstruction algorithms in hip prosthesis computed tomography imaging.', 'Evaluation of projection- and dual-energy-based methods for metal artifact reduction in CT using a phantom study.', 'Carbon-Ion Radiotherapy Using Metal Artifact Reduction Computed Tomography in a Patient with Prostate Cancer with Bilateral Hip Prostheses: A Case Report.']"""

Yet, challenges remain, and the mechanisms of arginine-starvation induced killing are largely unclear. Here, we sought to demonstrate the underlying mechanisms by which arginine starvation-induced cell death and to develop a dietary arginine-restriction xenograft model to study the in vivo effects. Methods: Multiple castration-resistant prostate cancer cell lines were treated with arginine starvation followed by comprehensive analysis of microarray, RNA-seq and ChIP-seq were to identify the molecular and epigenetic pathways affected by arginine starvation. Metabolomics and Seahorse Flux analyses were used to determine the metabolic profiles. A dietary arginine-restriction xenograft mouse model was developed to assess the effects of arginine starvation on tumor growth and inflammatory responses. Results: We showed that arginine starvation coordinately and epigenetically suppressed gene expressions, including those involved in oxidative phosphorylation and DNA repair, resulting in DNA damage, chromatin-leakage and cGAS-STING activation, accompanied by the upregulation of type I interferon response. We further demonstrated that arginine starvation-caused depletion of α-ketoglutarate and inactivation of histone demethylases are the underlying causes of epigenetic silencing. Significantly, our dietary arginine-restriction model showed that arginine starvation suppressed prostate cancer growth in vivo, with evidence of enhanced interferon responses and recruitment of immune cells. Conclusions: Arginine-starvation induces tumor cell killing by metabolite depletion and epigenetic silencing of metabolic genes, leading to DNA damage and chromatin leakage.

Inflammation is implicated in many cancer types, including prostate cancer. Activation of MAP3K7 (also termed TAK1) and downstream IκB kinase β (IKKβ) by proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα stimulates NF-κB survival pathways. Paradoxically, MAP3K7 is often deleted in human prostate cancer. Here, we demonstrate that AR protein expression is lower in inflammatory tumor areas compared with non-inflammatory tissues in patients with prostate cancer. Map3k7 knockout increased AR protein levels and activity in the mouse prostate, and MAP3K7 and AR protein levels were inversely correlated in prostate cancer patient specimens. TNFα treatment increased AR protein ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Mechanistically, activation of IKKβ by TNFα induced phosphorylation and TRCP1/2 E3 ligase-mediated polyubiquitination and degradation of AR protein. TNFα suppressed prostate cancer proliferation, which could be rescued by blockade of AR degradation. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized tumor suppressive function of the inflammation-activated MAP3K7-IKKβ axis in degrading AR protein. Moreover, they suggest that aberrant elevation of AR protein could be a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for MAP3K7-deficient prostate cancer.

However, the function and mechanisms of circLRP6 in prostate cancer (PCa) tumorigenesis remain largely undefined.  Methods:   Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot assays were conducted to assess the expression of circLRP6, microRNA (miR)-330-5p, and nuclear receptor binding protein 1 (NRBP1). Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), colony formation, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EDU) incorporation, flow cytometry, transwell, wound healing, and western blot assays were performed to detect cell proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis in vitro. Subcutaneous tumor growth was observed in nude mice to investigate the role of circLRP6 in vivo. The targeting relationship between miR-330-5p and NRBP1 or circLRP6 was verified using dual-luciferase reporter, pull-down, and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays. Immunohistochemistry was employed to test relative protein expression.  Results:   CircLRP6 was highly expressed in PCa tissues and cells, knockdown of circLRP6 impaired PCa cell growth and metastasis in vitro by affecting cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Mechanistic studies showed that circLRP6 could competitively bind with miR-330-5p to prevent the degradation of its target gene NRBP1. Rescue assay suggested that miR-330-5p inhibition reversed the inhibitory effects of circLRP6 knockdown on PCa cell growth and metastasis. Moreover, overexpression of miR-330-5p suppressed PCa progression via NRBP1. Notably, tumor formation assay indicated that circLRP6 silencing impeded tumor growth and EMT in vivo.  Conclusion:   Our findings demonstrated that circLRP6 promoted PCa tumorigenesis and metastasis through miR-330-5p/NRBP1 axis, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for PCa.""","""['Linghui Qin', 'Xiaosong Sun', 'Fei Zhou', 'Cheng Liu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""World J Surg Oncol""","""['The Circular RNA Circ_0085494 Regulates Prostate Cancer Progression Through NRBP1/miR-497-5p Axis.', 'Circular RNA circ_0062019 exerts oncogenic properties in prostate cancer via mediating miR-1253/NRBP1 axis.', 'Puerarin Inhibits the Progression of Bladder Cancer by Regulating circ_0020394/miR-328-3p/NRBP1 Axis.', 'Exosomal circRNA Scm-like with four malignant brain tumor domains 2 (circ-SFMBT2) enhances the docetaxel resistance of prostate cancer via the microRNA-136-5p/tribbles homolog 1 pathway.', 'Circ_0044516 Enriches the Level of SARM1 as a miR-330-5p Sponge to Regulate Cell Malignant Behaviors and Tumorigenesis of Prostate Cancer.', 'The Circular RNA Circ_0085494 Regulates Prostate Cancer Progression Through NRBP1/miR-497-5p Axis.', 'Collective analysis of the expression and prognosis for LEM-domain proteins in prostate cancer.', 'miR-499a inhibits the proliferation and apoptosis of prostate cancer via targeting UBE2V2.']"""

Methods:   In this sequential explanatory study, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of employment experiences among ethnically diverse, working-age individuals diagnosed with breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer. Following the survey, we conducted semi-structured interviews with cancer survivors and informal caregivers to explore changes in employment status and coping techniques to manage these changes.  Results:   Among employed survivors (n = 333), cancer caused numerous work disruptions including issues with physical tasks (53.8%), mental tasks (46.5%) and productivity (76.0%) in the workplace. Prostate cancer survivors reported fewer work disruptions than female breast and male and female colorectal cancer survivors. Paid time off and flexible work schedules were work accommodations reported by 52.6% and 36.3% of survivors, respectively. In an adjusted regression analysis, household income was positively associated with having received a work accommodation. From the qualitative component of the study (survivors n = 17; caregivers n = 11), three key themes emerged: work disruptions, work accommodations, and coping mechanisms to address the disruptions. Survivors and caregivers shared concerns about lack of support at work and resources to navigate issues caused by changes in employment.  Conclusions:   This study characterized employment changes among a diverse group of cancer survivors. Work accommodations were identified as a specific unmet need, particularly among low-income cancer survivors.

Our objective was to establish the prognostic value of individual Gleason 5 patterns in a radical prostatectomy (RP) cohort. We reviewed 1064 RPs and recorded Grade Group (GG), pT-stage, surgical margin status, Gleason 4 and 5 growth patterns as well as intraductal carcinoma. The clinical endpoints were biochemical recurrence and post-operative distant metastasis. Gleason pattern 5 was present in 339 (31.9%) RPs, of which 47 (4.4%) presented as primary, 166 (15.6%) as secondary, and 126 (11.8%) as tertiary pattern. Single cells/cords were present in 321 (94.7%) tumors with Gleason pattern 5, solid fields in 90 (26.5%), and comedonecrosis in invasive carcinoma in 32 (9.4%) tumors. Solid fields demonstrated either a small nested morphology (n = 50, 14.7%) or medium to large solid fields (n = 61, 18.0%). Cribriform architecture was present in 568 (53.4%) RPs. Medium to large solid fields and comedonecrosis coincided with cribriform architecture in all specimens, and were not observed in cribriform-negative cases. In multivariable analysis adjusted for Prostate-Specific Antigen, pT-stage, GG, surgical margin status and lymph node metastases, cribriform architecture (Hazard Ratio (HR) 9.9; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 3.9-25.5, P < 0.001) and comedonecrosis (HR 2.1, 95% CI 1.2-3.7, P = 0.01) were independent predictors for metastasis-free survival, while single cells/cords (HR 1.2; 95% CI 0.7-1.8, P = 0.55) and medium to large solid fields (HR 1.6, 95% CI 0.9-2.7, P = 0.09) were not.

Attributing this dependence to molecular diffusivity, we hypothesized that macromolecular delivery efficiency could be enhanced by increasing either laser fluence or laser exposure duration at low fluence. We observed increased percentages of macromolecule uptake by cells in both cases. However, trade-off between cell uptake and viability loss was most favorable at low laser fluence (25-29 mJ/cm2) and longer exposure durations (4-5 min).

Prostate radiation delivery in the setting of hip prostheses is complicated by both imaging artifacts that interfere with volume delineation and dosimetric effects that must be addressed in the planning process. We hypothesized that with specialized planning, any photon-based definitive prostate radiotherapy approach may be utilized in patients with bilateral hip prostheses. Imaging data from sequential patients with prostate cancer and bilateral hip prostheses treated definitively with radiation were retrospectively reviewed. Bimodality imaging was used to define targets and organs at risk (OARs) along with specialized MRI sequences and/or orthopedic metal artifact reduction (OMAR) for MRI and CT artifact suppression, respectively. Multiple VMAT plans were generated for each set of patient images to include three fractionation schemes (conventional, hypofractionated, and SBRT), each with hip avoidance and with simulated normal hip. The ability to meet standard dose constraints was assessed for each plan type. Differences in target and OAR dosing between plans accounting for prosthetic hips via avoidance vs plans with simulated absence of prosthetic hip were also assessed. T-tests were used to compare dosimetric parameters. Ten patients with bilateral hip prostheses were identified, and 6 plans were created for each patient for a total of 60 radiation plans. Prosthetic hip avoidance did not result in failure to meet dose constraints for any patient. Hip avoidance resulted in minimal increases in high dose to the rectum and bladder (increases in mean V80%, V90%, and V95% ranged from 0.1% to 2.4%). Larger increases were seen at lower dose levels, with rectal V50% significantly increased in all three plan types with hip avoidance (conventional: 26.0% [standard deviation, SD 13.9] vs 16.9% [SD 10.2, p = 0.003]; hypofractionation: 26.4% [SD 13.3] vs 17.1% [SD 10.1, p = 0.002]; SBRT: 18.3% [SD 10.7] vs 10.5% [SD 6.9, p = 0.008]). Similarly, hip avoidance resulted in increases in bladder V50% to 31.7% (SD 16.8) vs 23.3% (SD 14.0, p = 0.001), 31.3% (SD 17.0) vs 23.3% (SD 13.8, p = 0.002), and 22.7% (SD 12.3) vs 16.5% (SD 12.6, p < 0.001) for conventional, hypofractionated, and SBRT plans, respectively. Hydrogel spacer resulted in reductions in rectal dose. For example, V70% for hip avoidance plans decreased with spacer presence to 8.3% (SD 6.7) vs 21.1% (SD 5.8, p = 0.021), 8.6% (SD 6.5) vs 21% (SD 5.7, p = 0.022), and 3.7% (SD 3.2) vs 15% (SD 8.2, p = 0.010) for conventional, hypofractionated, and SBRT plans, respectively.

Low socioeconomic status (SES) is related to advanced stages at diagnosis; inequalities could explain differences in outcomes by age. The influence of SES, age and residence area on staging was explored in the Umbrian population.  Methods:   2001-2010 cases were geo-coded by census tract of residence. Stage distribution or Gleason score were analyzed by multilevel multinomial logistic regression with age and SES as the fixed effects and census tract as the random-effect.  Results:   For breast and colorectal cancers, the screening age class was advantaged. For breast, age effect was modulated by deprivation and census tract. In the elderly, the richest were advantaged, the poorest disadvantaged; issues emerged for the young. For colon, age effect is modulated by census tract in early stages and deprivation in late stages. The elderly were disadvantaged; the young and the deprived had more stages IV. About rectum, age effect was modulated by deprivation in the late stages. The elderly were disadvantaged; the young and the deprived presented more stages IV. For prostate, age effect was modulated by deprivation and census tract. The intermediate age class was advantaged, the elderly disadvantaged.  Conclusion:   Age was not always the determinant of a delayed staging when SES was considered. For breast and colorectal cancers, issues of delayed diagnosis emerged in the young. If the care center was near the residence, the census tract modified the stage at diagnosis.

Three specific BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants, referred to as BRCA-Jewish founder mutations (B-JFM), account for >90% of BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants in people of AJ ancestry. Current practice of identifying eligible individuals for BRCA testing based on personal and/or family history has been shown to miss at least 50% of people who have one of these variants. Here we describe the protocol of the JeneScreen study-a study established to develop and evaluate two different population-based B-JFM screening programmes, offered to people of Jewish ancestry in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia.  Methods and analysis:   To rmeasure the acceptability of population-based B-JFM screening in Australia, two screening programmes using different methodologies have been developed. The Sydney JeneScreen programme provides information and obtains informed consent by way of an online tool. The Melbourne JeneScreen programme does this by way of community sessions attended in person. Participants complete questionnaires to measure clinical and psychosocial outcomes at baseline, and for those who have testing, 2 weeks postresult. Participants who decline testing are sent a questionnaire regarding reasons for declining. Participants with a B-JFM are sent questionnaires 12-month and 24-month post-testing. The questionnaires incorporate validated scales, which measure anxiety, decisional conflict and regret, and test-related distress and positive experiences, and other items specifically developed or adapted for the study. These measures will be assessed for each programme and the two population-based B-JFM screening methods will be compared.

Our results show that the expression of miR-196a is elevated in LNCaP prostate cancer cells with reduced levels of β2-adrenergic receptor after stably transfection with three different shRNAs. Furthermore, treatment with β-blockers showed that this upregulation is strictly related to the low levels of β2-adrenergic receptor and not to the inhibition of the receptor signaling activity.

GSTP1 protein was positive in at least one TMA core in 7.7% of cases and in all TMA cores in 4.4% of cases.

Thus, there is an urgent need to provide mechanism research, treatment strategies and/or prognosis evaluation based on the patient stratification of BC subtypes. The prostate-derived ETS factor SPDEF was first identified as an activator of prostate specific antigen, and then, the involvements in many aspects of BC have been proposed. However, the subtype-specific molecular function of SPDEF in BC and insights into prognostic significance have not been clearly elucidated. This study demonstrated for the first time that SPDEF may play a diversity role in the expression levels, clinicopathologic importance, biological function and prognostic evaluation in BC via bioinformatics and experimental evidence, which mainly depends on different BC subtyping.

Their role and how they impact on psychological distress and quality of life in men with prostate cancer specifically have not been established.  Methods:   A cross-sectional sample of 144 men with prostate cancer was recruited. Multiple regression and conditional process analysis were used to assess whether psychological flexibility moderates the relationship between fear of recurrence and distress and quality of life.  Results:   Psychological flexibility significantly predicted psychological distress (β = -0.56, p < 0.0001) and quality of life (β = 0.21, p < 0.0001), appearing a stronger predictor of psychological distress than fear of recurrence (β = 0.25, p < 0.0001). Fear of recurrence was a stronger predictor of quality of life (β = -0.41, p < 0.0001) than psychological flexibility. Psychological flexibility moderated the relationship between fear of recurrence and psychological distress (β = -0.01, p < 0.001). At low and average levels of psychological flexibility, psychological distress mediated the relationship between fear of recurrence and quality of life (β = -0.33 to -0.16, p < 0.05). At high levels of psychological flexibility, distress no longer mediated this relationship (β = 0.01, ns), supporting the role of psychological flexibility as a moderator.

The present study aimed to explore the role and potential mechanism of cancer-derived exosomal circ_0081234 in prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   Exosomes were extracted using the ExoQuick Precipitation Kit (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA, USA). The levels of circ_0081234, miR-1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1 (MAP 3 K1) were examined using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or western blotting. Cell migration and invasion were evaluated via a transwell assay. The protein levels of N-cadherin, vimentin and E-cadherin were detected by western blotting. The interaction between miR-1 and circ_0081234 or MAP 3 K1 was verified via a dual-luciferase reporter assay and an RNA pull-down assay.  Results:   The circ_0081234 level was increased in PCa tissues with spinal metastasis in comparison to primary PCa tissues without spinal metastasis. Exosomal circ_0081234 promoted the migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of PCa cells. Knockdown of circ_0081234 blocked PCa cell progression by regulating miR-1. In addition, miR-1 overexpression suppressed PCa cell progression by repressing MAP 3 K1. Moreover, circ_0081234 increased MAP 3 K1 level via sponging miR-1.

If not recognized early, patients with advanced prostate cancer can experience debilitating complications which can otherwise be prevented by early androgen deprivation therapy. This research intends to define clear diagnostic tools that will guide practitioners in the rural community setting toward early management of advanced prostate cancer.  Methods:   We conducted a cross-sectional observational study at three referral hospitals in Kigali, Rwanda on patients who presented with clinical suspicion of advanced prostate cancer over a period of 6 months. All patients underwent prostate biopsy as well as metastatic work up (CT or MRI), for those who were eligible. Statistical analysis was done using STATA 14.2.  Results:   114 patients were included in the study. The median age was 70 years (interquartile range: 65-79 years). In total 14 (12.3%) patients were found to have benign disease, while 100 (87.7%) patients were found to have cancer. Among those who had cancer, 85 (85%) had advanced prostate cancer. 110/114 (96.5%) were symptomatic at presentation. Common presenting symptoms were lower urinary tract symptoms (80.7%), back pain (54.4%), and urinary retention (36.8%). Abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE) was a strong risk factor for both cancer and advanced disease. Prostate cancer was found in 92.2% of those with abnormal DRE compared to 41.7% in those with normal DRE (p = 0.001). Also, cancer was found in 96.1% of those with multinodular prostate on DRE (p = 0.02) and had high odds (OR 14.6; CI 3.41-62.25) of having advanced prostate cancer (p < 0.001). The mean (± SD) PSA was 643.3 ± 1829.8 ng/ml and the median (range) was 100 ng/ml (9.05-10,000 ng/ml) for the whole study population. All patients with prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) of 100 ng/ml or above had advanced prostate cancer.  Conclusion:   The results show that there is a significant correlation between clinical findings and advanced prostate cancer. All patients with abnormal DRE and PSA above 100 ng/ml had advanced prostate cancer.

The objectives of this study were to assess the association between having a cancer care coordinator (CCC) and long-term health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and to evaluate whether this association differed by level of health literacy.  Methods:   A population-based sample of survivors diagnosed with breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer in 2015 from the Iowa Cancer Registry participated in an online survey conducted in 2017-2018 (N = 368). Chi-squared tests and logistic regression were used to model the association between patient characteristics and having a cancer care coordinator. Linear regression was used to model the association between patient perception of having a cancer care coordinator and post-treatment physical or mental HRQoL by differing levels of health literacy while controlling for sociodemographic and clinical factors.  Results:   Most survivors (81%) reported having one healthcare professional who coordinated their cancer care. Overall, patient perception of having a coordinator was not significantly associated with physical HRQoL (p = 0.118). However, participants with low health literacy (21%) who had a coordinator had significantly higher physical HRQoL scores compared to those who did not (adjusted mean difference 5.2, p = 0.010), while not so for medium (29%) or high (51%) health literacy (p = 0.227, and p = 0.850, respectively; test for interaction p = 0.001). Mental HRQoL was not associated with having a coordinator in our analyses.  Conclusion:   Findings suggest that care coordinators improved post-treatment physical HRQoL, particularly for participants with low health literacy. Care coordinators may be beneficial to the most vulnerable patients struggling to navigate the complex healthcare system during cancer treatment.

Methods:   The effect of the treatment on survival and migration of human PC3 cells was evaluated by MTT and scratch assay, respectively. Apoptosis and cell cycle distribution were detected by image-based cytometry. mRNA and protein expression were determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, respectively.  Results:   Apigenin and doxorubicin dose-dependently inhibited cell survival, and co-administration of both agents significantly induced cell death via upregulating the mRNA expression of caspases, Bax and cytochrome c, and downregulating Bcl-XL. Combination therapy caused cell cycle arrest by upregulating the expression of p21 and p27. The treatment modality inhibited cell migration via downregulating Snail, Twist and MMPs in which doxorubicin was ineffective. Apigenin dephosphorylated Akt strongly, significantly suppressed ERK phosphorylation, and increased PTEN expression 4.5-fold. The combination of apigenin and doxorubicin inhibited PI3K and AKT phosphorylation more strongly than a single administration.

Materials and methods:   PC3, DU145, and LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines were used. The MTT assay was used to determine cell viability. Western blotting analysis was performed using anti-DRG2 antibodies. Cells were transfected with 50 nmol DRG2 siRNA using an siRNA transfection reagent for DRG2 knockdown. The cell cycle was analyzed by using flow cytometry, and apoptosis was detected by using the Annexin V cell death assay.  Results:   DRG2 expression differed in each prostate cancer cell line. Docetaxel reduced DRG2 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Upon DRG2 knockdown in prostate cancer cells, an increase in the sub-G1 phase was observed without a change in the G1 or G2/M phases. When 4 nM docetaxel was administered to DRG2 knockdown prostate cancer cell lines, an increase in the sub-G1 phase was observed without increasing the G2/M phase, which was similar to that in DU145 cells before DRG2 knockdown. In PC3 and DU145 cell lines, DRG2 knockdown increased docetaxel-induced Annexin V (+) apoptosis by 8.7 and 2.7 times, respectively.  Conclusions:   In prostate cancer cells, DRG2 regulates G2/M arrest after docetaxel treatment. In prostate cancer cells with DRG2 knockdown, apoptosis increases without G2/M arrest in response to docetaxel treatment.

In this study, we developed a hydrogel drug delivery system for local paclitaxel delivery using the natural polysaccharide alginate functionalized with β-CyD-moieties. Paclitaxel was chosen due to its ability to form inclusion complexes with cyclodextrins. The rheological and mechanical properties of the prepared hydrogels were characterized, as well as in vitro release of the paclitaxel and in vitro activity on PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Introduction of β-CyD-moieties into the hydrogel reduces the mechanical properties of the gels compared to nonmodified gels. However, gelation kinetics were not markedly different. Furthermore, the β-CyD-modified alginate helped to reduce undesired crystallization of the paclitaxel in the gel and facilitated paclitaxel diffusion out of the gel network. Remarkably, the β-CyD grafted alginate showed increased capacity to complex paclitaxel compared to free HPβ-CyD. Release of both paclitaxel and degradation products were measured from the gels and were shown to have cytotoxic effects on the PC-3 cells.

This study aimed to investigate the risks of developing SHMs in patients with T1/T2 PC undergoing different treatment modalities.  Methods:   Patients with T1/T2 PC were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Competing risk regression (CRR) model was performed to evaluate the hazard ratios (HRs) of developing SHMs. As SHMs scarcely occur, the relative risk (RR) analysis was employed to compare the risks of different treatment modalities associating with the development of SHMs.  Results:   The CRR analysis showed that undergoing RT was associated with a higher risk of developing SHMs (external beam radiation therapy [EBRT]: HR = 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10-1.34; radioactive implant [RI]: HR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.06-1.36). As for different types of SHMs, EBRT, and RI were correlated with decreased risks of developing CLL (RR = 0.67, 0.72; 95% CI: 0.53-0.85, 0.54-0.96, respectively), but with the increased risks of developing NHL (RR = 1.18, 1.23; 95% CI: 1.02-1.35, 1.05-1.44, respectively); EBRT also showed increased risks of developing acute/ chronic myeloid leukemia (AML/CML, RR = 1.54, 1.56; 95% CI: 1.16-2.03,1.05-2.33, respectively); No increased risk of developing SHMs was detected in patients who only underwent prostatectomy.  Conclusions:   Although RT was found to be associated with the increased risks of developing SHMs in patients with T1/T2 PC, this finding cannot be extended to diverse types of SHMs. RT was correlated with the increased risks of the development of NHL, AML, and CML, but with the decreased risk of developing CLL.

Patients completed a cross-sectional telephone interview in English, Spanish, Cantonese or Mandarin. Multivariable logistic regression models, stratified by race/ethnicity, estimated the associations of patient demographic and health characteristics with participation in (1) any research, (2) behavioral research, and (3) biological/clinical research.  Results:   We included 855 prostate cancer patients: African American (19%), Asian American (15%), Latino (24%), and White (42%).

Therefore predictive strategies determining patients at risk for a prolonged healing duration are needed to optimize treatment. Thus, the present study evaluates whether or not bone turnover markers can be used to predict the healing duration in MRONJ patients.  Materials and methods:   The present study is a retrospective data analysis of patients suffering from MRONJ and positive histology for Actinomyces spp., who were identified at the General Hospital Vienna from 2014 to 2018. During the first visit, the patients' demographics and levels of bone formation parameters were compiled. Healing times were analysed by Cox regression in dependence on these factors.  Results:   A total of 52 patients were identified who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The indication for bone-modifying agents was breast cancer (n = 21), prostate cancer (n = 14), multiple myeloma (n = 6) and other malignant diseases (n = 11). In 43 (82.7%) of our patients, we were able to document complete mucosal healing. Furthermore, patients who responded faster to therapy showed higher levels of C-telopeptide (P < 0.05), osteocalcin (P < 0.05) and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (P < 0.05), but lower levels of 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D (P < 0.05) than slower responding patients. No correlation was found regarding parathyroid hormone or calcitonin levels. Interestingly, patients who had a slower response were less likely to report dental procedures, but more likely to report a history of chemotherapy.

Objective:   The aim of this article is to provide a summary of the aetiology, investigation and management of haematuria in the primary care setting, with a focus on urological assessment and outcomes.  Discussion:   The approach to the diagnosis and investigation of haematuria differs depending on whether the haematuria is macro- or microscopic.

Prostate cancer-free men from the general population were randomly selected and matched to the index case by birth year and county of residence, forming the unexposed control group. The participants were followed until a diagnosis of esophageal or gastric cancer, death, emigration, or end of the study period. The risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma, cardia gastric adenocarcinoma, non-cardia gastric adenocarcinoma, and esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma among ADT-exposed compared to unexposed was calculated by multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression. The hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were adjusted for confounders. There was a risk reduction of non-cardia gastric adenocarcinoma among ADT-users compared to non-users (HR 0.49 [95% CI 0.24-0.98]). No such decreased risk was found for esophageal adenocarcinoma (HR 1.17 [95% CI 0.60-2.32]), cardia gastric adenocarcinoma (HR 0.99 [95% CI 0.40-2.46]), or esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (HR 0.99 [95% CI 0.31-3.13]).

Five biopsy cores were obtained from each lesion ≥3 on PI-RADS v2.0 followed by a systematic 12-core biopsy.

Rats in this study were split into 3 groups and fed one of 2 diets: one diet containing 5% corn oil (CO, high LA), 5% CO oil and melatonin (2 μg/mL) or an alternative diet 5% FO (low LA). Rats whose diet contained melatonin had a faster rate of regression of PC3 prostate cancer xenografts than those receiving the FO diet, while both in the melatonin and FO groups induced the same rate of regression of HNSCC xenografts.

We aim to (1) assess the impact of a conversation-based decision aid (Option Grid) containing cost information about slow-growing prostate cancer management options, combined with urologic surgeon training, on the frequency and quality of patient-urologic surgeon cost conversations, and (2) examine the impact of the decision aid and surgeon training on decision quality.  Methods:   We will conduct a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial in outpatient urology practices affiliated with a large academic medical center in the USA. We will randomize five urologic surgeons to four intervention sequences and enroll their patients with a first-time diagnosis of slow-growing prostate cancer independently at each period. Primary outcomes include frequency of cost conversations, initiator of cost conversations, and whether or not a referral is made to address costs. These outcomes will be collected by patient report (post-visit survey) and by observation (audio-recorded clinic visits) with consent. Other outcomes include the following: patient-reported decisional conflict post-visit and at 3-month follow-up, decision regret at 3-month follow-up, shared decision-making post-visit, communication post-visit, and financial toxicity post-visit and at 3-month follow-up; clinician-reported attitudes about shared decision-making before and after the study, and feasibility of sustained intervention use. We will use hierarchical regression analysis to assess patient-level outcomes, including urologic surgeon as a random effect to account for clustering of patient participants.  Discussion:   This study evaluates a two-part intervention to improve cost discussions between urologic surgeons and patients when deciding how to manage slow-growing prostate cancer. Establishing the effectiveness of the strategy under study will allow for its replication in other clinical decision contexts.  Trial registration:   ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04397016 .

In addition, updated data regarding the first orally administered GnRH antagonist, relugolix, is presented.Expert opinion: Studies demonstrate that GnRH antagonists are at least equal with LHRH agonists in terms of testosterone suppression and PSA progression free survival with a major advantage being rapid testosterone suppression. Thus, the optimal group of patients included symptomatic metastatic prostate cancer patients especially if cardiovascular comorbidities or LUTS are also present. Emerging data regarding benefit of the use of GnRH antagonists in patients with concomitant cardiovascular disease are of great interest.

Methods:   We retrospectively analysed patients with prostate cancer who received ADT from January 2018 to June 2019. Patients were divided into ADT responder and ADT non-responder groups, and clinical risk factors were determined. Regions of interest were manually contoured on each slice on fat-saturated-T2-weighted imaging, and radiomic features were extracted. Uni- and multivariate logistic regression were used to establish radiomics, clinical and combined models.  Results:   There were 23 ADT non-responders and 20 ADT responders. In the clinical model, total prostate-specific antigen concentration and T stage were independent predictors of efficacy (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.774). The characteristics, MinIntensity and Correlation_ angle135_offset4 indicated an effective clinical model (AUC = 0.807).

Results:   A total of 39 patients were included in the study (13S-RALP, 26pRALP). Median operative time in the S-RALP group was 260minutes (pRALP: 257minutes), blood loss was 230ml (pRALP: 300ml). Complications occurred in 46.2% (6/13) of S-RALP patients (pRALP: 26.9%), including four Clavien-Dindo III complications (pRALP: 2/26).

The design of effective therapies for neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is complicated by limited knowledge of the molecular mechanisms governing NED. The paucity of acquired genomic alterations and the deregulation of epigenetic and transcription factors suggest a potential contribution from the microenvironment. In this context, whether ADT/ARPI induces stromal cells to release NED-promoting molecules and the underlying molecular networks are unestablished. Here, we utilized transgenic and transplantable mouse models and coculture experiments to unveil a novel tumor-stroma cross-talk that is able to induce NED under the pressure of androgen deprivation. Castration induced upregulation of GRP78 in tumor cells, which triggers miR29-b-mediated downregulation of the matricellular protein SPARC in the nearby stroma. SPARC downregulation enabled stromal cells to release IL6, a known inducer of NED. A drug that targets GRP78 blocked NED in castrated mice. A public, human NEPC gene expression dataset showed that Hspa5 (encoding for GRP78) positively correlates with hallmarks of NED.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been well documented to be involved in the progression of multiple cancers. Nevertheless, the role of lncRNAs in PCa bone metastasis remains largely unclear.  Methods:   The expression of prostate cancer-associated transcripts was analyzed in published datasets and further verified in clinical samples and cell lines by RT-qPCR and in situ hybridization assays. Colony formation assay, MTT assay, cell cycle analysis, EdU assay, Transwell migration and invasion assays, wound healing assay, and in vivo experiments were carried out to investigate the function of prostate cancer-associated transcript 6 (PCAT6) in bone metastasis and tumor growth of PCa. Bioinformatic analysis, RNA pull-down, and RIP assays were conducted to identify the proteins binding to PCAT6 and the potential targets of PCAT6. The therapeutic potential of targeting PCAT6 by antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) was further explored in vivo.  Results:   PCAT6 was upregulated in PCa tissues with bone metastasis and increased PCAT6 expression predicted poor prognosis in PCa patients. Functional experiments found that PCAT6 knockdown significantly inhibited PCa cell invasion, migration, and proliferation in vitro, as well as bone metastasis and tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, METTL3-mediated m6 A modification contributed to PCAT6 upregulation in an IGF2BP2-dependent manner. Furthermore, PCAT6 upregulated IGF1R expression by enhancing IGF1R mRNA stability through the PCAT6/IGF2BP2/IGF1R RNA-protein three-dimensional complex. Importantly, PCAT6 inhibition by ASO in vivo showed therapeutic potential against bone metastasis in PCa. Finally, the clinical correlation of METTL3, IGF2BP2, IGF1R, and PCAT6 was further demonstrated in PCa tissues and cells.  Conclusions:   Our study uncovers a novel molecular mechanism by which the m6 A-induced PCAT6/IGF2BP2/IGF1R axis promotes PCa bone metastasis and tumor growth, suggesting that PCAT6 may serve as a promising prognostic marker and therapeutic target against bone-metastatic PCa.""","""['Chuandong Lang', 'Chi Yin', 'Kaiyuan Lin', 'Yue Li', 'Qing Yang', 'Zhengquan Wu', 'Hong Du', 'Dong Ren', 'Yuhu Dai', 'Xinsheng Peng']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Clin Transl Med""","""['Long non-coding RNAs in bone metastasis: progresses and perspectives as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.', 'YTHDF2 mediates the mRNA degradation of the tumor suppressors to induce AKT phosphorylation in N6-methyladenosine-dependent way in prostate cancer.', 'Activation of the KDM5A/miRNA-495/YTHDF2/m6A-MOB3B axis facilitates prostate cancer progression.', 'm6A mRNA methylation initiated by METTL3 directly promotes YAP translation and increases YAP activity by regulating the MALAT1-miR-1914-3p-YAP axis to induce NSCLC drug resistance and metastasis.', 'Clinical prospects of long noncoding RNAs as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets in prostate cancer.', 'm6A-modified circABCC4 promotes stemness and metastasis of prostate cancer by recruiting IGF2BP2 to increase stability of CCAR1.', 'The long transcript of lncRNA TMPO-AS1 promotes bone metastases of prostate cancer by regulating the CSNK2A1/DDX3X complex in Wnt/β-catenin signaling.', 'Crosstalk between m6A and coding/non-coding RNA in cancer and detection methods of m6A modification residues.', 'Oncofetal protein IGF2BPs in human cancer: functions, mechanisms and therapeutic potential.', 'Long non-coding RNAs in bone metastasis: progresses and perspectives as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.']"""

However, the value of PSMA PET imaging in patients with advanced hormone-sensitive or hormone-resistant PCa is still largely unknown. The aim of this study was to analyze the detection rate and distribution of lesions using PSMA PET imaging in patients with advanced PCa and ongoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).  Methods:   A total of 84 patients diagnosed with hormone-sensitive or hormone-resistant PCa who underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computer tomography (CT) under ongoing ADT were retrospectively analyzed. We assessed the detection of PSMA-positive lesions overall and for three PSA subgroups (0 to < 1 ng/mL, 1 to < 20 ng/mL and > 20 ng/mL). In addition, PSMA-positive findings were stratified by localization (prostatic fossa, pelvic, para-aortic, mediastinal/supraclavicular and axillary lymph nodes, bone lesions and visceral lesions) and hormone status (hormone-sensitive vs. hormone-resistant). Furthermore, we assessed how many patients would be classified as having oligometastatic disease (≤ 3 lesions) and theoretically qualify for metastasis-directed radiotherapy (MDRT) in a personalized patient management.  Results:   We detected PSMA-positive lesions in 94.0% (79 of 84) of all patients. In the three PSA subgroups detection rates of 85.2% (0 to < 1 ng/mL, n = 27), 97.3% (1 to < 20 ng/mL, n = 37) and 100% (> 20 ng/mL, n = 20) were observed, respectively. PSMA-positive visceral metastases were observed only in patients with a PSA > 1 ng/mL. Detection of PSMA-positive lesions did not significantly differ between patients with hormone-sensitive and hormone-resistant PCa. Oligometastatic PCa was detected in 19 of 84 patients (22.6%). Almost all patients, 94.7% (n = 18) would have been eligible for MDRT.  Conclusions:   In this study, we observed an overall very high detection rate of 94% using PSMA PET imaging in patients with advanced PCa and ongoing ADT.

However, which treatment is better remains controversial. This study aimed to compare the prognostic difference between radical prostatectomy (RP) and radiotherapy (RT) in PCa patients at different stages and ages. Two independent PCa cohorts (the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results, SEER; and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian, PLCO) were employed. Cox regression was used to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In both cohorts, patients who received RT exhibited a worse prognostic outcome than those who underwent RP. When stratified analysis was performed by tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage and age at diagnosis in the SEER cohort, the HR of RT versus RP for overall survival increased with TNM stage but decreased with age. Specifically, PCa patients in stage I in the age range of 55-84 years, stage IIA at 70-85+ years, and stage IIB at 75-85+ years had better survival with RT than RP patients (p < 0.05). In contrast, patients in stages IIA, IIB, III and IV with respective age ranges of 55-64 years; 50-74 years; 55-59, 65-74 years; and 45-74 years showed worse survival with RT compared with RP (p < 0.05).

Our objective was therefore to evaluate the relation between testosterone and concomitant prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels during ADT on clinical outcomes.  Materials and methods:   Patients from the continuous androgen deprivation arm of the PR.7 trial of intermittent ADT for biochemically recurrent prostate cancer following radiotherapy were included. Statistical analyses evaluated the prognostic importance of testosterone levels during ADT relative to concomitant PSA levels. We similarly evaluated whether the number of testosterone breakthroughs >1.7 nmol/l predicted the time to castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), cancer specific survival (CSS) or overall survival (OS) with Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses.  Results:   Overall, the prognostic importance of testosterone on outcomes was eclipsed by the prognostic value of concomitant PSA values. The occurrence of testosterone values >0.7 nmol/l in the first year of therapy was associated with subsequent rises >1.7 nmol/l, but the number of testosterone breakthroughs per patient had no relationship to the risk of CRPC, CSS or OS. A time-dependent adjusted analysis indicated as expected that PSA values were prognostic, but there was no association of relative cumulative testosterone exposure with outcomes.

Inclusion criteria encompassed: ≥pT3, International Society of Urological Pathology grade ≥4, or positive surgical margin. A 1:4 propensity score-matched-analysis of 1,599 patients was conducted (307: eRT, ≤6 months after RP; 1,292: dRT, >6 months after RP). Primary end point was general HRQOL (based on European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30). Pearson correlation and binary logistic regression models were used to estimate the impact of timing of RT on HRQOL. Functional outcome was assessed using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire, short form (ICIQ-SF) and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) questionnaires.  Results:   Median followup was 38 months. At 12 months and 24 months followup, general HRQOL scores were significantly higher for dRT (52.7 vs 35.5; p=0.001; 45.8 vs 37.3; p=0.026). ICIQ-SF scores were higher (8.5 vs 6.1; p=0.001; 8.4 vs 7.3; p=0.038), and IIEF-5 scores were lower (1.8 vs 4.2; p=0.001; 2.2 vs 4.4; p=0.005) for eRT at 12 months and 24 months. On multivariate-analysis, dRT was associated with superior general HRQOL at 12 months (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37-0.94, p=0.027) and 24 months (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.39-0.99, p=0.043), respectively.

Methods:   In 1301 consecutive RPs, we analyzed each tumor nodule (TN) for TV, Grade Group (GG), presence of focal versus nonfocal EPE, SV+ , and SM+. Using GG1 (GP4% = 0) TNs as a reference, we recorded GP4% for all GG2 or GG3 TNs. We performed a multivariable analysis (MVA) using a mixed effects logistic regression that tested significant variables for risk of EPE, SV+, and SM+, as well as a multinomial logistic regression model that tested significant variables for risks of nonorgan-confined disease (pT2+, pT3a, and pT3b) versus organ-confined disease (pT2).  Results:   We identified 3231 discrete TNs ranging from 1 to 7 (median: 2.5) per RP. These included GG1 (n = 2115), GG2 (n = 818), GG3 (n = 274), and GG4 (n = 24) TNs. Increasing GP4% weakly paralleled increasing TV (tau = 0.07, p < .001). In MVA, increasing GP4% and TV predicted a greater likelihood of EPE (odds ratio [OR]: 1.03 and 4.41), SV+ (OR: 1.03 and 3.83), and SM+ (1.01, p = .01 and 2.83), all p < .001.

Conclusions:   Both GP4% and TV are independent predictors of adverse pathological stage and margin status at RP. However, the risks for adverse outcomes associated with GP4% are marginal, while those for TV are strong.

Methods and participants:   For all enrolled patients, the Select Mdx test, the risk calculator ERSPC3 + DRE, and a prostatic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were carried out. Subsequently, a systematic 12-core trans-rectal biopsy and a targeted biopsy, in the case of a prostate imaging-reporting and data system (PIRADS) > 2 lesion (max three lesions), were performed. To assess the accuracy of the Select MDx test in the detection of clinically Sig PCa, the test sensitivity was evaluated. Secondary objectives were specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), positive predictive value (PPV), and area under the curve (AUC). A direct comparison with the ERSPC + DRE risk calculator and MRI were also performed. We also studied the predictive ability to diagnose Sig PCa from the combination of the Select MDx test with MRI using clinical decision-curve analysis.  Results:   There were 163 patients enrolled after meeting the inclusion criteria and study protocol. The Select MDx test showed a sensitivity of 76.9% (95% CI, 63.2-87.5), 49.6% specificity (95% CI, 39.9-59.2), 82.09% (95% CI, 70.8-90.4) NPV, and 41.67% (95% CI, 31.7-52.2) PPV for the diagnosis of Sig PCa. COR analysis was also performed, which showed an AUC of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.56-0.71). There were no differences in the accuracy of Select MDx, ERSPC + DRE, or MRI. The combination of Select MDX + MRI showed the highest impact in the decision-curve analysis, with an NPV of 93%.  Conclusion:   Our study showed a worse performance for the SelectMdx test than previously reported, within a cohort of patients with a PSA 3-10 ng/ml and a normal DRE, with results similar to those from ERSPC + DRE RC and MRI, but with an improvement in the usual PSA pathway.

Materials and methods:   A U-NET convolutional neural network was developed to translate 0.35 T TRUFI MRI into electron density map using a novel cost function equalizing the contribution of various tissue types including fat, muscle, bone, and background air in training. The impact of training time, dataset size, image standardization, and data augmentation approaches was also quantified. Mean absolute error (MAE) between synthetic and planning CTs was calculated to measure the goodness of the model.  Results:   With 20 patients in training, our U-NET model has the potential to generate synthetic CT with a MAE of about 29.68 ± 4.41, 16.34 ± 2.67, 23.36 ± 2.85, and 105.90 ± 22.80 HU over the entire body, fat, muscle, and bone tissues, respectively.

The authors' aim was to assess the role of race as it relates to treatment benefit in access to CaP treatment in a single-payer population.  Methods:   The authors used the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Corporate Data Warehouse to perform a retrospective cohort study of veterans diagnosed with low- or intermediate-risk CaP between 2011 and 2017.  Results:   The authors identified 35,427 men with incident low- or intermediate-risk CaP. When they controlled for covariates, Black men had 1.05 times the odds of receiving treatment in comparison with non-Black men (P < .001), and high-treatment-benefit men had 1.4 times the odds of receiving treatment in comparison with those in the low-treatment-benefit group (P < .001). The interaction of race and treatment benefit was significant, with Black men in the high-treatment-benefit category less likely to receive treatment than non-Black men in the same treatment category (odds ratio, 0.89; P < .001).  Conclusions:   Although race does appear to influence the receipt of definitive treatment in the VHA, this relationship varies in the context of the patient's treatment benefit, with Black men receiving less definitive treatment in high-benefit situations. The influence of patient race at high treatment benefit levels invites further investigation into the driving forces behind this persistent disparity in this consequential group.""","""['Temitope Rude', 'Dawn Walter', 'Shannon Ciprut', 'Matthew D Kelly', 'Chan Wang', 'Angela Fagerlin', 'Aisha T Langford', 'Herbert Lepor', 'Daniel J Becker', 'Huilin Li', 'Stacy Loeb', 'Joseph Ravenell', 'John T Leppert', 'Danil V Makarov']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Urological Oncology: Prostate Cancer.', 'Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Prostate Cancer Outcomes in the Veterans Affairs Health Care System.', 'Comparison by Race of Conservative Management for Low-Risk and Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancers in Veterans From 2004 to 2018.', 'Access to definitive treatment and survival for intermediate-risk and high-risk prostate cancer at hospital systems serving health disparity populations.', ""'Race' and prostate cancer mortality in equal-access healthcare systems."", 'Prostate cancer disparities in South Carolina: early detection, special programs, and descriptive epidemiology.', 'Racial disparities in Black men with prostate cancer: A literature review.', ""Addressing Black men's oral health through community engaged research and workforce recruitment.""]"""

We construct a test statistic based on expectation maximization (EM) algorithm and derive its asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis. An important computational advantage of the test is that the involved parameter estimates under the complex alternative hypothesis can be obtained through a small number of EM iterations, rather than optimizing the objective function.

We have chosen multiple datasets from primary, castration-resistant, chemo-resistant and metastatic prostate cancer stages for investigation.

In our attempt to highlight hub gene-associated mutations and drug interactions, FLNC was found to be most commonly mutated and CDKN1A gene was found to have highest druggability. Moreover, from DAVID and gene set enrichment analysis, the focal adhesion and oestrogen signalling pathways were found enriched which indicates the involvement of hub genes in tumour invasiveness and metastasis.

This includes activation of methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2) expression, the central player in the m1C cycle. Consistent with the key role of m1C cycle in prostate cancer, MTHFD2 knockdown inhibited prostate cancer cell growth, prostatosphere formation, and growth of patient-derived xenograft organoids. In addition, therapeutic silencing of MTHFD2 by systemically administered nanoliposomal siRNA profoundly inhibited tumor growth in preclinical prostate cancer mouse models. Consistently, MTHFD2 expression is significantly increased in human prostate cancer, and a gene expression signature based on the m1C cycle has significant prognostic value. Furthermore, MTHFD2 expression is coordinately regulated by ATF4 and the oncoprotein c-MYC, which has been implicated in prostate cancer. These data suggest that the m1C cycle is essential for prostate cancer progression and may serve as a novel biomarker and therapeutic target.

The Prostate Risk Identification using MicroUS (PRI-MUS) protocol was used to assess the risk of CaP and csCaP. All patients received both targeted and systematic biopsies. The primary endpoint was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of microUS in detection of csCaP in patients with a PI-RADS 3 lesion at MRI. Specifically, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of microUS were determined. Multivariable logistic regression models (MLRMs) were fitted to identify predictors of CaP. The diagnostic accuracy was reported as area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve.  Results:   Overall, 43 patients (38.7%) harboured CaP and 22 (20%) csCaP. MicroUS showed a high sensitivity and negative predictive value (100%), while its specificity and positive predictive value were 33.7% and 27.2%, respectively. Among patients without lesions at microUS, 25 (83.3%) did not harbour CaP, while 5 (16.7%) patients were diagnosed with a Gleason score 6 CaP, with no patients harbouring csCaP. Using microUS, the csCaP detection would have remained 100%, while reducing the detection of insignificant CaP of a 23.8% extent (n = 5). In MLRMs, lesion identified at microUS and continuously-coded PSAd were independent predictors of CaP. The accuracy of a model including PRI-MUS score, digital rectal examination (DRE), PSA density, age and family history was 0.744 (95% CI: 0.645 - 0.843).  Conclusion:   In our single-institutional retrospective study, microUS was potentially capable to stratify the presence of CaP in patients with an equivocal MRI. Further prospective studies on larger populations are needed to validate our results.""","""['Pier Paolo Avolio', 'Giovanni Lughezzani', 'Marco Paciotti', 'Davide Maffei', 'Alessandro Uleri', 'Nicola Frego', 'Rodolfo Hurle', 'Massimo Lazzeri', 'Alberto Saita', 'Giorgio Guazzoni', 'Paolo Casale', 'Nicolò Maria Buffi']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Clinical utility of MR/ultrasound fusion-guided biopsy in patients with lower suspicion lesions on active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Diagnostic Accuracy of Microultrasound in Patients with a Suspicion of Prostate Cancer at Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Single-institutional Prospective Study.', 'PI-RADS 3 lesions: Does the association of the lesion volume with the prostate-specific antigen density matter in the diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer?', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric ultrasound and micro-ultrasound in prostate cancer: a comprehensive review.', 'Diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of micro-ultrasound guided biopsies in patients with suspected prostate cancer.', 'Micro-Ultrasound: Current Role in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis and Future Possibilities.', 'Multiparametric ultrasound of prostate: role in prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Micro-Ultrasound in the Diagnosis and Staging of Prostate and Bladder Cancer: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Application of Multiple Ultrasonic Techniques in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Patients with cancer often are excluded from aortic valve replacement (AVR) trials including trials with transcatheter AVR (TAVR) and surgical AVR (SAVR). This study looks at how cancer may influence treatment options and assesses the outcome of patients with cancer who undergo SAVR or TAVR intervention. Additionally, we sought to quantitate and compare both clinical and cost outcomes for patients with and without cancer.  Methods:   This population-based case-control study uses the most recent year available National Inpatient Sample (NIS (2016) from the United States Department of Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Machine learning augmented propensity score adjusted multivariable regression was conducted based on the likelihood of undergoing TAVR versus medical management (MM) and TAVR versus SAVR with model optimization supported by backward propagation neural network machine learning.  Results:   Of the 30,195,722 total hospital admissions, 39,254 (0.13%) TAVRs were performed, with significantly fewer performed in patients with versus without cancer even in those of comparable age and mortality risk (23.82% versus 76.18%, p < 0.001) despite having similar hospital and procedural mortality. Multivariable regression in patients with cancer demonstrated that mortality was similar for TAVR, MM, and SAVR, though LOS and cost was significantly lower for TAVR versus MM and comparable for TAVR versus SAVR. Patients with prostate cancer constituted the largest primary cancer among TAVR patients including those with metastatic disease. There were no significant race or geographic disparities for TAVR mortality.  Discussion:   Comparison of aortic valve intervention in patients with and without cancer suggests that interventions are underutilized in the cancer population. This study suggests that patients with cancer including those with metastasis have similar inpatient outcomes to patients without cancer. Further, patients who have symptomatic AS and those with higher risk aortic valve disease should be offered the benefit of intervention. Modern techniques have reduced intervention-related adverse events, provided improved quality of life, and appear to be cost effective; these advantages should not necessarily be denied to patients with co-existing cancer.""","""['Dominique J Monlezun#', 'Logan Hostetter#', 'Prakash Balan', 'Nicolas Palaskas', 'Juan Lopez-Mattei', 'Mehmet Cilingiroglu', 'Zaza Iakobishvili', 'Michael Ewer', 'Konstantinos Marmagkiolis', 'Cezar Iliescu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cardiooncology""","""['In-hospital outcomes of transcatheter versus surgical aortic valve replacement in end stage renal disease.', 'Cost and contribution margin of transcatheter versus surgical aortic valve replacement.', 'Length of Stay and Discharge Disposition After Transcatheter Versus Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in the United States.', 'Sutureless Aortic Valve Replacement for Treatment of Severe Aortic Stenosis: A Single Technology Assessment of Perceval Sutureless Aortic Valve Internet.', 'Exploring the Difference in Post-procedural Stroke Rates Between Patients with Aortic Stenosis Who Undergo Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Versus Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement.', 'Artificial intelligence-augmented analysis of contemporary procedural, mortality, and cost trends in carcinoid heart disease in a large national cohort with a focus on the ""forgotten pulmonic valve"".', 'Artificial Intelligence-Augmented Propensity Score, Cost Effectiveness and Computational Ethical Analysis of Cardiac Arrest and Active Cancer with Novel Mortality Predictive Score.', 'Fractional Flow Reserve Cardio-Oncology Effects on Inpatient Mortality, Length of Stay, and Cost Based on Malignancy Type: Machine Learning Supported Nationally Representative Case-Control Study of 30 Million Hospitalizations.', '2021.

Especially interleukine (IL-)6 is involved in the development of aggressive PCa. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) have been reported to interact with cancer cells and subsequently lead to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, the role of anti-nflammatory cytokines, such as IL-4 is still largely unexplored in prostate cancer. In the present study, we investigated the effects of IL-4 on PBMC co-cultured with PCa cells.  Materials and methods:   PBMC were co-culured with the PCa cell lines LNCaP and LNCaP-IL6+. To avoid cell-cell contact, cancer and immune cells were separated using cell culture inserts with a 0.4 μm pore size membrane. Cell growth was assessed using the [3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] (MTT) assay. Cytokine levels were measured using a BD™Cytometric Bead Array.  Results:   Cell viability of LNCaP cells decreased massively when cells were co-cultured with PBMC. Pre-incubation with IL-4 could partly rescue the observed effect of cell viability of LNCaP cells co-cultured with PBMC. In contrast, cell viability of the LNCaP-IL6+ cell line was not affected when co-cultured with PBMC.

Gleason scores can be extracted from pathology report texts using regular expressions, but previously developed programmes have targeted only relatively simple Gleason score expressions. We developed a programme capable of extracting also complex expressions. The programme is relatively easy to adapt to other languages and datasets.  Methods:   We developed and evaluated our regular expression-based programme using manually processed pathology reports of prostate cancer cases diagnosed in Finland in 2016-2017. Both simple and complex Gleason score expressions were targeted. We measured the performance of our programme using recall, precision, and the F1. The proportion of complex Gleason score expressions was estimated as the complement of the recall when only addition expressions (e.g. ""Gleason 3 + 4"") were targeted.  Results:   The detection of values (scores and score components) is based on mandatory keywords before or after the value. The programme favours precision over recall by primarily allowing for lists of optional expressions between keyword-value pairs and only secondarily allowing for arbitrary expressions. The programme is straightforward to adapt to new datasets by modifying the lists of mandatory and optional expressions. The full and addition-only programmes had 92% (95% CI: [90%, 95%]) and 65% ([61%, 70%]) recall and high precision (98% [97%, 99%] and 100% [99%, 100%]), respectively. The estimated proportion of complex Gleason score expressions was 100-65 = 35%.  Conclusions:   Even complex Gleason score expressions can be extracted with high recall and precision using regular expressions.

We compare salvage Retzius-sparing robotic assisted radical prostatectomy (SRS-RARP) with salvage standard robotic assisted radical prostatectomy (SS-RARP).  Materials and methods:   A total of 72 patients across 9 centers were identified (40 SRS-RARP vs 32 SS-RARP). Demographics, perioperative data, and pathological and functional outcomes were compared using Student's t-test and ANOVA. Cox proportional hazard models and Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to assess risk of incontinence and time to continence. Linear regression models were constructed to investigate postoperative pad use and console time.  Results:   Median followup was 23 vs 36 months for SRS-RARP vs SS-RARP. Console time and estimated blood loss favored SRS-RARP. There were no differences in complication rates or oncologic outcomes. SRS-RARP had improved continence (78.4% vs 43.8%, p <0.001 for 0-1 pad, 54.1% vs 6.3%, p <0.001 for 0 pad), lower pads per day (0.57 vs 2.03, p <0.001), and earlier return to continence (median 47 vs 180 days, p=0.008). SRS-RARP was associated with decreased incontinence defined as >0-1 pad (HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.10-0.79, p=0.016), although not when defined as >0 pad (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.31-1.01, p=0.053). On adjusted analysis SRS-RARP was associated with decreased pads per day. Lymph node dissection and primary treatment with stereotactic body radiation therapy were associated with longer console time.

Predominantly, AGR2 exists as a homodimer via a dimerization domain (E60-K64); after it is self-dimerized, it helps FGF2 and VEGF to homo-dimerize and promotes the angiogenesis and the invasion of vascular endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Up till now, no small molecule has been discovered to inhibit the AGR2-AGR2 homodimer. Therefore, the present study was performed to prepare a validated 3D structure of AGR2 by homology modeling and discover a small molecule by screening the FDA-approved drugs library on AGR2 homodimer as a target protein. Thirteen different homology models of AGR2 were generated based on different templates which were narrowed down to 5 quality models sorted by their overall Z-scores. The top homology model based on PDB ID = 3PH9 was selected having the best Z-score and was further assessed by Verify-3D, ERRAT and RAMPAGE analysis. Structure-based virtual screening narrowed down the large library of FDA-approved drugs to ten potential AGR2-AGR2 homodimer inhibitors having FRED score lower than - 7.8 kcal/mol in which the top 5 drugs' binding stability was counter-validated by molecular dynamic simulation. To sum up, the present study prepared a validated 3D structure of AGR2 and, for the first time reported the discovery of 5 FDA-approved drugs to inhibit AGR2-AGR2 homodimer by using structure-based virtual screening. Moreover, the binding of the top 5 hits with AGR2 was also validated by molecular dynamic simulation.

The per-patient cancer detection rates (CDRs) according to biopsy type or PI-RADS category were investigated.  Results:   The CDRs of TB, SB, and CB for csPCa were 47.7% (62/130 patients), 29.2% (38/130), and 52.3% (68/130), respectively. For csPCa, the CDRs of TB and CB according to PI-RADS categories of 3, 4, or 5 were 25.0% (8/32) and 31.3% (10/32), 41.2% (28/68) and 45.6% (31/68), or 86.7% (26/30) and 90.0% (27/30), respectively. In 6 (4.6%) patients, csPCa was detected only by SB. In 18 (13.8%) patients, SB detected PCa of a higher ISUP grade than TB. In 11 (8.5%) patients, SB detected csPCa at contralateral peripheral zone of TB.  Conclusion:   Modified TRUS-guided 12-core CB using prebiopsy MRI seems to be feasible. It may reduce total biopsy cores in patients who are suitable for CB based on prebiopsy MRI findings.""","""['Chorog Song', 'Sung Yoon Park']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Abdom Radiol (NY)""","""['Prevalence of Prostate Cancer in PI-RADS Version 2.1 Transition Zone Atypical Nodules Upgraded by Abnormal DWI: Correlation With MRI-Directed TRUS-Guided Targeted Biopsy.', 'Additive Value of Transrectal Systematic Ventral Biopsies in Combination with Magnet Resonance Imaging/Ultrasound Fusion-Guided Biopsy in Patients with 3 or More Negative Prostate Biopsies.', 'Not All Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Biopsies Are Equal: The Impact of the Type of Approach and Operator Expertise on the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', 'Comparing Three Different Techniques for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Prostate Biopsies: A Systematic Review of In-bore versus Magnetic Resonance Imaging-transrectal Ultrasound fusion versus Cognitive Registration.

Herein, we developed a new signal-amplified photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunosensing method for quantitative monitoring of the target PSA based on the ion-exchange reaction for the in situ formation of ZnO/CdS/Ag2S nanohybrids triggered by the as-released silver ions (Ag+) from silver nanolabels. Initially, the introduction of a target PSA caused the formation of a sandwich immunocomplex in an anti-PSA capture antibody (cAb)-coated microplate with the help of a silver nanoparticle-labeled detection antibody (AgNPs-dAb). Thereafter, the introduced AgNPs were dissolved with acid to release numerous silver ions. In this regard, an ion-exchange reaction occurred between the silver ions and ZnO/CdS nanorods on the photosensitive electrode, thus producing ZnO/CdS/Ag2S nanohybrids to generate a relatively strong photocurrent. Under optimal conditions, the ion-exchange reaction-based PEC immunoassay exhibited a good linear range of 0.05-50 ng mL-1 and allowed the detection of the target PSA at a concentration as low as 0.018 ng mL-1. In addition, the PEC immunoassay displayed satisfactory repeatability, high specificity, and acceptable method accuracy. Importantly, the ion-exchange reaction-based PEC immunoassay provides a new perspective for the detection of other disease-related biomarkers by controlling the corresponding antibodies.""","""['Ling Zhu', 'Zipeng Yin', 'Zijian Lv', 'Meijin Li', 'Dianping Tang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Analyst""","""['Bio-bar-code-based photoelectrochemical immunoassay for sensitive detection of prostate-specific antigen using rolling circle amplification and enzymatic biocatalytic precipitation.', 'Double ion-exchange reaction-based photoelectrochemical immunoassay for sensitive detection of prostate-specific antigen.', 'All-solid-state metal-mediated Z-scheme photoelectrochemical immunoassay with enhanced photoexcited charge-separation for monitoring of prostate-specific antigen.', 'Electrochemical immunosensor based on ZnO nanorods-Au nanoparticles nanohybrids for ovarian cancer antigen CA-125 detection.', 'Advances in nanomaterial-based immunosensors for prostate cancer screening.']"""

Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), highly over-expressed on PCa cells, is an excellent target for selective imaging of PCa. In recent years, various scaffolds have been explored as potential carriers to target diagnostic and therapeutic agents to PSMA+ tumour cells. Numerous fluorescent or radioisotope probes linked via a peptide linker have been developed that selectively binds to PCa cells. However, there are very few reports that examine the effects of chemical modifications in the peptide linker of an imaging probe on its affinity to PSMA protein. This report systematically investigates the impact of hydrophobic aromatic moieties in the peptide linker on PSMA affinity and in vitro performance. For this, a series of fluorescent bioconjugates 12-17 with different aromatic spacers were designed, synthesized, and their interactions within the PSMA pocket were first analysed in silico. Cell uptake studies were then performed for 12-17 in PSMA+ cell lines and 3D tumour models in vitro. Binding affinity values of 12-17 were found to be in the range of 36 to 157.9 nM, and 12 with three aromatic groups in the spacer exhibit highest affinity (KD = 36 nM) compared to 17 which is devoid of aromatic groups. These studies suggest that aromatic groups in the spacer region can significantly affect deep tissue imaging of fluorescent bioconjugates. Bioconjugate 12 can be a promising diagnostic tool, and conjugation to near-infrared agents would further its applications in deep-tissue imaging and surgery. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

False-positive results of prior, relatively insensitive screening tests, however, can lead to expensive and often unnecessary surgery. Several reports have suggested the potential use of the ejaculate to screen for prostate conditions. Hitherto, the potential impact of sterilization on the diagnostic potential of seminal plasma screening has not been examined. Herein, we report cellular and molecular comparisons of semen samples obtained from normal (N = 5), vasectomized (N = 5) and prostate pathology patients (N = 4; confirmed by a biopsy) that were centrifuged over 60% PureSperm cushions. Non-penetrating cells were washed prior to immunocytochemistry with prostatic epithelial cell markers including PSMA, NKX3.1 and CD24. KRT18 was used to highlight epithelial cells in these samples. RNA sequencing was then used to identify differentially expressed small RNAs associated with vasectomy and prostate pathology. Specific gene transcripts were confirmed by RT-qPCR. PMSA+/KRT18+, CD24+/KRT18+ and NKX3.1/+KRT18+ cells were observed, albeit infrequently in most processed semen samples by indirect immunocytochemistry. Targeted RT-qPCR supported their enrichment, along with their putative designation as prostatic luminal cells. Small RNAs in seminal plasma were highly heterogeneous, with tRNAs and miRNAs being the dominant forms. Hsa-miR-143 and hsa-miR-199 were among the most prominent of the differentially expressed miRNAs upregulated in samples with prostate pathology but not vasectomy. The targets of these small RNAs illustrate biological processes involved among others in transcription regulation and collagen metabolism. Our outcomes strongly support an appraisal of selected biologically meaningful small RNAs of ejaculate semen for prostate health screening. A long-term goal would be a simple, routine, noninvasive test for monitoring prostate health, potentially among younger men.""","""['Gisela Lorente', 'Panagiotis Ntostis', 'Norman Maitland', 'Lourdes Mengual', 'Mireia Musquera', 'Asif Muneer', 'Rafael Oliva', 'David Iles', 'David Miller']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Syst Biol Reprod Med""","""['Semen miRNAs Contained in Exosomes as Non-Invasive Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Vasectomy and vasovasostomy have no effect on seminal plasma zinc concentrations.', ""Changes of free amino acids in seminal plasma with vasectomy and reanastomosis of the vas deferens (author's transl)."", 'Male sterilization.', 'Is vasectomy harmful to health?', 'Increased Density of Growth Differentiation Factor-15+ Immunoreactive M1/M2 Macrophages in Prostate Cancer of Different Gleason Scores Compared with Benign Prostate Hyperplasia.']"""

Objective:   To assess the definition and clinical implications of persistently elevated PSA after sLND for node-only recurrent PCa after radical prostatectomy.  Design, setting, and participants:   The study included 579 patients treated with sLND at 11 high-volume centers between 2000 and 2016.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We assessed the linear relationship between the first PSA after sLND and death from PCa. Different definitions of PSA persistence were included in a multivariable model predicting cancer-specific mortality (CSM) after surgery to identify the best cutoff value. We investigated the association between PSA persistence and oncologic outcomes using multivariable regression models. Moreover, the effect of early androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) after sLND was tested according to PSA persistence status and estimated risk of CSM.  Results and limitations:   We found an inverse relationship between the first PSA after sLND and the probability of cancer-specific survival. PSA persistence defined as first postoperative PSA ≥0.3 ng/ml provided the best discrimination accuracy (C index 0.757). According to this cutoff, 331 patients (57%) experienced PSA persistence. The median follow-up for survivors was 48 mo (interquartile range 27-74). After adjusting for confounders, men with persistently elevated PSA had higher risk of clinical recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 1.61), overall mortality (HR 2.20), and CSM (HR 2.59; all p < 0.001) after sLND. Early ADT administration after sLND improved survival only for patients with PSA persistence after surgery (HR 0.49; p = 0.024). Similarly, when PSA persistence status was included in multivariable models accounting for pathologic features, early ADT use after sLND was beneficial only for patients with a predicted risk of CSM at 5 yr of >10%.  Conclusions:   PSA persistence after sLND independently predicts adverse prognosis, with the best discrimination accuracy for CSM provided by a definition of PSA ≥ 0.3 ng/ml. We showed that when stratifying patients by final pathology results and PSA persistence status, early ADT use after sLND was beneficial only for patients with PSA persistence or with a calculated 5-yr risk of CSM of >10%, which could be useful as we await results from ongoing prospective trials.  Patient summary:   We found that for patients with prostate cancer who had lymph nodes removed after their cancer recurred, persistently elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels predict poorer prognosis. We showed that a PSA level of ≥0.3 ng/ml provides the best accuracy in identifying patients with worse prognosis. This may help to improve risk stratification after lymph node removal and allow physicians to optimize treatment strategies after surgery.""","""['Carlo A Bravi', 'Matteo Droghetti', 'Nicola Fossati', 'Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Nazareno Suardi', 'Elio Mazzone', 'Vito Cucchiara', 'Simone Scuderi', 'Francesco Barletta', 'Riccardo Schiavina', 'Daniar Osmonov', 'Klaus-Peter Juenemann', 'Luca Boeri', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Alexander Kretschmer', 'Alexander Buchner', 'Christian Stief', 'Andreas Hiester', 'Alessandro Nini', 'Peter Albers', 'Gaëtan Devos', 'Steven Joniau', 'Hendrik Van Poppel', 'Bernhard Grubmüller', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Axel Heidenreich', 'David Pfister', 'Derya Tilki', 'Markus Graefen', 'Inderbir S Gill', 'Alexandre Mottrie', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Alberto Briganti']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['Long-term Outcomes of Salvage Lymph Node Dissection for Nodal Recurrence of Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy: Not as Good as Previously Thought.', 'The Role of Prostate-specific Antigen Persistence After Radical Prostatectomy for the Prediction of Clinical Progression and Cancer-specific Mortality in Node-positive Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Identifying the Optimal Candidate for Salvage Lymph Node Dissection for Nodal Recurrence of Prostate Cancer: Results from a Large, Multi-institutional Analysis.', 'Management of positive lymph nodes following radical prostatectomy.', 'Contemporary role of salvage lymphadenectomy in patients with recurrence following radical prostatectomy.', 'Combining PSA and PET features to select candidates for salvage lymph node dissection in recurrent prostate cancer.']"""

On the contrary, primary tumors of the seminal vesicles are rare. Among these, the most common is seminal vesicle adenocarcinoma. To date, less than 100 cases have been reported in literature. Morphologically, primary SV adenocarcinoma is described as a papillary or sheetlike growth architecture, with trabecular and glandular patterns, composed by hobnail tumor cells, frequently with mucinous differentiation. On the contrary, mesenchymal tumors include benign lesions such as leiomyoma, schwannoma, fibroma, paraganglioma, solitary fibrous tumor, cystadenoma, and mixed epithelial and stromal tumors (MEST).Cystadenoma is a rare benign tumor, while MESTs are biphasic tumors with stromal and benign epithelial components. Histological features such as stromal atypia, mitotic activity, nuclear pleomorphism, and tumor necrosis distinct MEST in low-, intermediate-, and high-grade tumors.In recent years, multiple studies reported a link between tumorigenesis and tumor microenvironment. In this regard, the molecular mechanisms connecting prostate cancer (PCa) progression and the host microenvironment have been described and include extracellular matrix (ECM), myofibroblasts, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), neuroendocrine cells, adipose tissue, and the immune-modulatory cells. Of note, only one study evaluated the influence of seminal vesicle's tumor microenvironment (SVME) on prostate cancer cells so far. Besides, in vivo experiments in NOD/SCID mice clarified the influence of SVME on PCa progression. As such, the injection of PC3 cells into the prostate or the SV resulted in different tumor aggressiveness, and the incidence of retroperitoneal lymph node metastases was significantly higher in mice models receiving SV injection. These findings demonstrated that SVs (rather than the prostate) offer a stimulating tumor microenvironment for growth and invasion of prostate cancer cells.""","""['Alessia Cimadamore', 'Rodolfo Montironi', 'Sergio Serni', 'Riccardo Campi']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""Adv Exp Med Biol""","""['Mixed epithelial-stromal tumor (MEST) of seminal vesicle: a proposal for unified nomenclature.', 'Enhanced progression of human prostate cancer PC3 cells induced by the microenvironment of the seminal vesicle.', 'Spectrum of incipient (or precursor) lesions in the mucosa of the seminal vesicles.', 'Malignancy arising in seminal vesicles in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) model.', 'Seminal vesicle cystadenoma: a case report and literature review.', 'Schwannoma of the seminal vesicle: Case report and review of the literature.', 'Spindle cell/pleomorphic lipoma of the seminal vesicle: First description of a rare benign mesenchymal tumor.', 'Focus on the tumor microenvironment: A seedbed for neuroendocrine prostate cancer.']"""

The heterogeneity that characterizes prostate tumors contributes to clinical challenges in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of this malignancy. While localized prostate cancer can be treated with surgery or radiotherapy, metastatic disease to the lymph nodes and the bone requires aggressive treatment with androgen deprivation treatment (ADT). Unfortunately, this often eventually progresses to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Advanced prostate cancer treatment today involves 1st- and 2nd-line taxane chemotherapy and 2nd-generation antiandrogens. The process of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), during which epithelial cells lose their adhesions and their polarity, is a critical contributor to prostate cancer metastasis. In this article, we aim to integrate the current understanding of mechanisms dictating the dynamics of phenotypic EMT, with apoptosis outcomes in prostate tumors in response to antiandrogen and taxane chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced disease. Novel insights into the signaling mechanisms that target the functional interface between apoptosis and EMT will be considered in the context of potential clinical markers of tumor prognosis, as well as for effective therapeutic targeting of α- and β- adrenergic signaling (by novel and existing chemotherapeutic agents and antiandrogens).
