However, it is not known whether it stimulates the proliferation of prostate cells. In this study, we investigated whether benign prostatic hyperplasia epithelial cells (BPH-1 cells) infected with Trichomonas vaginalis induced the proliferation of prostate cells via a leptin signaling pathway. To investigate the effect of crosstalk between adipocyte leptin and inflamed epithelial cell in proliferation of prostate cells, adipocytes 3T3-L1 cells were incubated in conditioned medium of BPH-1 cells infected with T. vaginalis (T. vaginalis-conditioned medium, TCM), and then the adipocyte-conditioned medium (ATCM) was identified to cause proliferation of prostate cells. BPH-1 cells incubated with live T. vaginalis released pro-inflammatory cytokines, and conditioned medium of these cells caused migration of adipocytes. When prostate stromal cells and BPH-1 cells were incubated with adipocyte conditioned medium containing leptin, their growth rates increased as did expression of the leptin receptor (known as OBR) and signaling molecules such as JAK2/STAT3, Notch and survivin. Moreover, blocking the OBR reduced this proliferation and the expression of leptin signaling molecules in response to ATCM. In conclusion, our findings show that inflamed BPH-1 cells infected with T. vaginalis induce the proliferation of prostate cells through leptin-OBR signaling. Therefore, it is likely that T. vaginalis contributes to prostate enlargement in BPH via adipocyte leptin released as a result of inflammation of the prostate.""","""['Jung-Hyun Kim', 'Ik-Hwan Han', 'Su-Jin Shin', 'Sung-Yul Park', 'Hyo-Yeoung Chung', 'Jae-Sook Ryu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Korean J Parasitol""","""['Inflammatory response to Trichomonas vaginalis in the pathogenesis of prostatitis and benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Proliferation of Prostate Stromal Cell Induced by Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Epithelial Cell Stimulated With Trichomonas vaginalis via Crosstalk With Mast Cell.', 'Inflammatory Responses in a Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Epithelial Cell Line (BPH-1) Infected with Trichomonas vaginalis.', 'Polarization of M2 Macrophages by Interaction between Prostate Cancer Cells Treated with Trichomonas vaginalis and Adipocytes.', 'Androgen receptor roles in the development of benign prostate hyperplasia.', 'Inflammatory response to Trichomonas vaginalis in the pathogenesis of prostatitis and benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'The correlation between Trichomonas vaginalis infection and reproductive system cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Point-of-Care Diagnostic for Trichomonas vaginalis, the Most Prevalent, Non-Viral Sexually Transmitted Infection.', 'Involvement of Macrophages in Proliferation of Prostate Cancer Cells Infected with Trichomonas vaginalis.', 'Proliferation of Mouse Prostate Cancer Cells Inflamed by Trichomonas vaginalis.']"""

However, there are toxicity concerns related to the sink effect in low-volume disease. This prospective study aims to determine the kinetics of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA in mHSPC patients, analyzing the doses to organs at risk (salivary glands, kidneys, liver, and bone marrow) and tumor lesions < 1 cm diameter.  Methods:   Ten mHSPC patients underwent two cycles of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA therapy. Three-bed position SPECT/CT was performed at 5 time points after each therapy. Organ dosimetry and lesion dosimetry were performed using commercial software and a manual approach, respectively. Correlation between absorbed index lesion dose and treatment response (PSA drop of > 50% at the end of the study) was calculated and given as Spearman's r and p-values.  Results:   Kinetics of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA in mHSPC patients are comparable to those in mCRPC patients. Lesion absorbed dose was high (3.25 ± 3.19 Gy/GBq) compared to organ absorbed dose (salivary glands: 0.39 ± 0.17 Gy/GBq, kidneys: 0.49 ± 0.11 Gy/GBq, liver: 0.09 ± 0.01 Gy/GBq, bone marrow: 0.017 ± 0.008 Gy/GBq). A statistically significant correlation was found between treatment response and absorbed index lesion dose (p = 0.047).  Conclusions:   We successfully performed small lesion dosimetry and showed that the tumor sink effect in mHSPC patients is of less concern than was expected. Tumor-to-organ ratio of absorbed dose was high and tumor uptake correlates with PSA response. Additional treatment cycles are legitimate in terms of organ toxicity and could lead to better tumor response.""","""['Steffie M B Peters', 'Bastiaan M Privé', 'Maarten de Bakker', 'Frank de Lange', 'Walter Jentzen', 'Annemarie Eek', 'Constantijn H J Muselaers', 'Niven Mehra', 'J Alfred Witjes', 'Martin Gotthardt', 'James Nagarajah', 'Mark W Konijnenberg']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Examining Absorbed Doses of Indigenously Developed 177Lu-PSMA-617 in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients at Baseline and During Course of Peptide Receptor Radioligand Therapy.', 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Radioligand Therapy Using 177Lu-PSMA I&T and 177Lu-PSMA-617 in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Comparison of Safety, Biodistribution, and Dosimetry.', 'Dosimetry for (177)Lu-DKFZ-PSMA-617: a new radiopharmaceutical for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Radiation Dosimetry in 177Lu-PSMA-617 Therapy.', 'Lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan for prostate cancer.', 'Tumor dosimetry using 177Lu: influence of background activity, measurement method and reconstruction algorithm.', 'Joint EANM/SNMMI procedure guideline for the use of 177Lu-labeled PSMA-targeted radioligand-therapy (177Lu-PSMA-RLT).', 'Implant Imaging: Perspectives of Nuclear Imaging in Implant, Biomaterial, and Stem Cell Research.', 'Tumor Sink Effect with Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Targeted Theranostics in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Intra-Individual Evaluations.', 'Fibroblast activation protein-targeted radionuclide therapy: background, opportunities, and challenges of first (pre)clinical studies.']"""

Prospective trials have focused on ICI treatment in the first or second line. The aim of this analysis is to evaluate the benefit of ICI across different treatment lines.  Patients and methods:   This is a single-center retrospective study that included mRCC patients who received ICIs in various treatment lines. Objective response rates (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated.  Results:   Ninety-four patients were eligible for full evaluation. Patients were classified as International mRCC Database Consortium (IMDC) risk group categorization as good, intermediate and poor risk in 26.8%, 61.6% and 14.8% of cases, respectively. They were treated with ICI monotherapy, dual ICI therapy and ICI + tyrosine kinase inhibitor in 59%, 20% and 21% of cases, respectively. ORR, median PFS and OS for the entire cohort was 39.4%, 9.67 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 6.9-12.4 months] and 23.6 months (95% CI 13.3-33.9 months), respectively. The ORR by treatment line was 33% in first, 40.4% in the second, 35% in the third and 43.5% in the fourth line and beyond. Median PFS by treatment line was 8.6, 10.3, 7.9 and 7.23 months, respectively. The median OS was not reached in first-line treatment and was 26.2, 18.1 and 20.7 months in the second, third and fourth line and beyond, respectively.

Radiolabeled heterobivalent bispecific peptidic ligands (HBPLs) can target more than one receptor type and by this - besides exhibiting other advantages - increase tumor imaging sensitivity. In the present study, we show the initial in vivo evaluation of the most potent heterobivalent gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR)- and vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor subtype 1 (VPAC1R)-bispecific radiotracer and determined its tumor visualization potential via PET/CT imaging. For this purpose, the most potent described HBPL was synthesized together with its partly scrambled heterobivalent monospecific homologs and its monovalent counterparts. The agents were efficiently labeled with 68Ga3+ and evaluated in an initial PET/CT tumor imaging study in a human prostate carcinoma (PCa) xenograft rat tumor model established for this purpose. None of the three 68Ga-HBPLs enabled a clear tumor visualization and a considerably higher involvement in receptor-mediated uptake was found for the GRPR-binding part of the molecule than for the VPAC1R-binding one. Of the monovalent radiotracers, only [68Ga]Ga-NODA-GA-PESIN could efficiently delineate the tumor, confirming the results. Thus, this work sets the direction for future developments in the field of GRPR- and VPAC1R-bispecific radioligands, which should be based on other VPAC1R-specific peptides than PACAP-27.""","""['Simon Lindner', 'Henning Rudolf', 'Giovanna Palumbo', 'Rosel Oos', 'Melissa Antons', 'Ralph Hübner', 'Peter Bartenstein', 'Ralf Schirrmacher', 'Björn Wängler', 'Carmen Wängler']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Bioorg Med Chem Lett""","""['Design, synthesis and in\xa0vitro evaluation of heterobivalent peptidic radioligands targeting both GRP- and VPAC1-Receptors concomitantly overexpressed on various malignancies - Is the concept feasible?', 'Design, Synthesis, In Vitro, and Initial In Vivo Evaluation of Heterobivalent Peptidic Ligands Targeting Both NPY(Y₁)- and GRP-Receptors-An Improvement for Breast Cancer Imaging?', 'Design, Synthesis, In Vitro and In Vivo Evaluation of Heterobivalent SiFAlin-Modified Peptidic Radioligands Targeting Both Integrin αvβ3 and the MC1 Receptor-Suitable for the Specific Visualization of Melanomas?', 'Current State of Radiolabeled Heterobivalent Peptidic Ligands in Tumor Imaging and Therapy.', 'Imaging of Prostate Cancer Using Gallium-68-Labeled Bombesin.', 'Distribution of PACAP and PAC1 Receptor in the Human Eye.']"""

Methods:   Data were prospectively collected for men undergoing transperineal MRI-targeted biopsy at the outpatient clinic and tertiary hospital of a single center between October 2017 to February 2020. These data included demographic, procedural, and pathologic variables and complications. Time-driven activity-based costing was performed to compare procedural costs.  Results:   126 men were included. Age, BMI and PSA were similar for local (n = 45) vs sedation (n = 81), all P>0.05. Detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (CSPC) on combined systematic and targeted biopsy was similar for local vs sedation (24% vs 36%; P = 0.2). Local had lower detection on targeted biopsies alone (8.9% vs 25%; P = 0.03). However, fewer targeted cores were obtained per region of interest with local vs sedation (median 3 vs 4 cores; P<0.01). For local vs sedation, the complication rate was 2.6% and 6.1% (P = 0.6). The median visual analog pain score for local vs sedation was 3/10 vs 0/10 (P<0.01). The mean procedure time for local vs sedation was 22.5 vs 17.5 minutes (48.3 minutes when including anesthesia time). Time-driven activity-based costs for local vs sedation were $961.64 vs $2208.16 (P<0.01).  Conclusion:   Transperineal biopsy with local anesthesia is safe with comparable outcomes to sedation.

VM simulates blood vessel function in tumors to deliver a sufficient blood supply for proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of malignant tumors, thereby reducing the clinical effects of anti-angiogenic treatments. The elimination or prevention of malignant tumor VM development therefore represents an urgent research goal as a therapeutic strategy to and cut off nutrients required for tumor growth. The GATA transcription factor TRPS1 is abnormally up-regulated in breast cancer, osteosarcoma, prostate cancer, and other tumor tissues, and is instrumental in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue growth and development.  Methods:   Here, we explored the effects of TRPS1 knockdown on VM and the proteins underlying its development in triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231.  Results:   We found that TRPS1 knockdown resulted in obvious inhibition of VM development. Fluorescence microscopy of F-actin and tubulin revealed that loss of TRPS1 function resulted in disruption of cytoskeleton and microtubule formation, respectively. In addition, TRPS1-suppressed cells exhibited reduced accumulation of VM-associated proteins EphA2, MMP-2, MMP-9, VEGF, and VE-cadherin. Moreover, it is interesting to know that the capacity for migration and invasion were limited in MDA-MB-231cells after TRPS1 knockdown and that the average number of VM tubules, their length, and number of intersections were also significantly decreased.  Conclusions:   Based on our results, and in light of previous studies, we thus proposed that TRPS1 suppression negatively affects vascular mimicry possibly through reduced TRPS1-mediated transcriptional regulation of VM-related protein VEGF-A.""","""['M Wu', 'X Sun', 'T Wang', 'M Zhang', 'P Li']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Clin Transl Oncol""","""['Anti-angiogenic treatment promotes triple-negative breast cancer invasion via vasculogenic mimicry.', 'Brucine Suppresses Vasculogenic Mimicry in Human Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cell Line MDA-MB-231.', 'The role of WT1 isoforms in vasculogenic mimicry and metastatic potential of human triple negative breast cancer cells.', 'Vasculogenic Mimicry in Breast Cancer: Clinical Relevance and Drivers.', 'Vasculogenic mimicry and tumor metastasis.']"""

In our research, we first reported that FAM64A is up-regulated and positively associated with poor prognosis of patients with prostate cancer (PCa) by TCGA database and immunohistochemistry staining. Moreover, knockdown of FAM64A significantly suppressed the proliferation, migration, invasion, and cell cycle of PCa cells in vitro. Mechanistically, FAM64A expression was increased by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) through direct binding of AR to FAM64A promoter, and notably promoted the proliferation, migration, invasion, and cell cycle of androgen-dependent cell line of PCa. In addition, abnormal expression of FAM64A affects the immune and interferon signaling pathway of PCa cells.

The use of PET with prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) provides better accuracy than conventional imaging practice. This prospective, multicenter, international study was performed to evaluate the diagnostic performance and clinical impact of PSMA PET/CT for evaluating BCR in PCa patients in a worldwide scenario. Methods: Patients were recruited from 17 centers in 15 countries. Inclusion criteria were histopathologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma, previous primary treatment, clinically established BCR, and negative conventional imaging (CT plus bone scintigraphy) and MRI results for patients with PSA levels of 4-10 ng/mL. All patients underwent PET/CT scanning with 68Ga-PSMA-11. Images and data were centrally reviewed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to identify the independent predictors of PSMA-positive results. Variables were selected for this regression model on the basis of significant associations in the univariate analysis and previous clinical knowledge: Gleason score, the PSA level at the time of the PET scan, PSA doubling time, and primary treatment strategy. All patients were monitored for a minimum of 6 mo. Results: From a total of 1,004 patients, 77.7% were treated initially with radical prostatectomy and 22.3% were treated with radiotherapy. Overall, 65.1% had positive PSMA PET/CT results. PSMA PET/CT positivity was correlated with the Gleason score, PSA level at the time of the PET scan, PSA doubling time, and radiotherapy as the primary treatment (P < 0.001). Treatment was modified on the basis of PSMA PET/CT results in 56.8% of patients. PSMA PET/CT positivity rates were consistent and not statistically different among countries with different incomes. Conclusion: This multicenter, international, prospective trial of PSMA PET/CT confirmed its capability for detecting local and metastatic recurrence in most PCa patients in the setting of BCR. PSMA PET/CT positivity was correlated with the Gleason score, PSA level at the time of the PET scan, PSA doubling time, and radiotherapy as the primary treatment. PSMA PET/CT results led to changes in therapeutic management in more than half of the cohort.

Newer treatment modalities with specific targets are required for management. Plant-derived agents/drugs have historically been useful in cancer therapeutics. Natural metabolite i.e. plectranthoic acid (PA), inhibits the proliferation of PCa cells and has potent anti-cancer potential. Herein, we aim to identify the molecular signatures of PA. Proteins from control and PA-treated PCa cells were analysed using high-throughput labeled free proteomics approach. Data was processed with the SIEVE software and thoroughly analysed by using Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) and PANTHER. A total of 98 unique peptides, showing >2 fold change, were identified. Results indicated that PA modulates oncogenic pro-survival and pro-apoptotic signaling pathways in PCa cells. mTOR was the major canonical pathway targeted by PA, the inhibition of which was likely to induce PA mediated apoptosis. Moreover, PA interacts with the rapamycin binding domain of mTOR, demonstrated by the molecular dynamic (MD) simulation and binding free energy calculations. Furthermore, the biological process moderated by PA with a high percentage was a metabolic process. Taken together, PA appears to have pleiotropic effects, as it modulates multiple key signaling pathways, supporting the potential usefulness. SIGNIFICANCE: Studies on the mechanism of action of therapeutic agents are crucial for drug development. These studies support the selection of a therapeutic agent, appropriate models of its efficacy, and designing of further experiments. Furthermore, information on mechanism of action may suggest strategies for combination therapies. In this regard Proteomics provide the platform for comprehensive understanding of the molecular action mechanisms of newly discovered therapeutic agents. Current research highlights the new insights into mode of action of novel therapeutic metabolite i.e. Plectranthoic acid (PA). Using labeled free proteomics approach we extracted the underlying mechanisms for the anticancer activity of PA using prostate cancer model. The result of the study will pay the way for further investigations on this potent natural compound in different cancers and will provide a root for its development as a lead.""","""['Nosheen Akhtar', 'Sumra Wajid Abbasi', 'Samina Rubnawaz', 'Laila Jafri', 'Rehana Rani']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Proteomics""","""['Targeting epithelial to mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer by a novel compound, plectranthoic acid, isolated from Ficus microcarpa.', 'The pentacyclic triterpenoid, plectranthoic acid, a novel activator of AMPK induces apoptotic death in prostate cancer cells.', 'Triptonide acts as a novel antiprostate cancer agent mainly through inhibition of mTOR signaling pathway.', 'Target to apoptosis: a hopeful weapon for prostate cancer.', 'Mechanism of Anti-Cancer Activity of Curcumin on Androgen-Dependent and Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer.']"""

The dose-effect relation of the anorectal dose parameters (D2cm3 and D50%) and GI toxicity grade ≥2 in four years of follow-up was assessed using a mixed model analysis for repeated measurements, adjusted for age, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, T-stage, baseline toxicity grade ≥1, hormonal therapy and institute.  Results:   A dose-effect relation for D2cm3 and D50% was observed with adjusted odds ratios of 1.17 (95% CI 1.13-1.21, p < 0.0001) and 1.20 (95% CI 1.14-1.25, p < 0.0001) for GI toxicity, respectively.  Conclusion:   Although there was no difference in toxicity between study arms, a higher radiation dose to the anorectum was associated with a statistically significant increase in GI toxicity following EBRT for prostate cancer.

To assess the uptake of PCa screening investigations by men invited for screening. The uptake of the pilot study would guide the opening of the larger BARCODE1 study recruiting 5000 men.  Subjects and methods:   Healthy males aged 55-69 years were invited to participate via their general practitioners (GPs). Saliva samples were collected via mailed collection kits. After DNA extraction, genotyping was conducted using a study specific assay. Genetic risk was based on genotyping 130 germline PCa risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A polygenic risk score (PRS) was calculated for each participant using the sum of weighted alleles for 130 SNPs. Study participants with a PRS lying above the 90th centile value were invited for PCa screening by prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and biopsy.  Results:   Invitation letters were sent to 1434 men. The overall study uptake was 26% (375/1436) and 87% of responders were eligible for study entry. DNA genotyping data were available for 297 men and 25 were invited for screening. After exclusions due to medical comorbidity/invitations declined, 18 of 25 men (72%) underwent MRI and biopsy of the prostate. There were seven diagnoses of PCa (38.9%).

Patient Summary What is the paper about? Very few prostate cancer screening programmes currently exist anywhere in the world. Our pilot study investigated if men in the UK would find it acceptable to have a genetic test based on a saliva sample to examine their risk of prostate cancer development. This test would guide whether men are offered prostate cancer screening tests. What does it mean for patients? We found that the study design was acceptable: 26% of men invited to take part agreed to have the test. The majority of men who were found to have an increased genetic risk of prostate cancer underwent further tests offered (prostate MRI scan and biopsy). We have now expanded the study to enrol 5000 men.

In this retrospective study, we go beyond the single-tumor region and investigate the utility of proposed radiomic zones for risk classification and clinical outcome predictions using radiomic features extracted from 11 C-choline positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and supervised machine learning in prostate tumors.  Materials and methods:   Seventy-seven prostate tumors were selected and delineated. The prostate organ was divided into three radiomic zones, with zone-1 being the metabolic tumor zone, zone-2 the proximal peripheral tumor zone, and zone-3 the extended peripheral tumor zone. LIFEx was used for PET-radiomic feature extraction. Risk groups were created using Gleason scores (GS), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, clinical TNM staging, and progression-free survival (PFS). Random forest (RF) and AdaBoost advanced machine learning algorithms were used for supervised machine learning. Accuracy, positive predictive value, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AreaROC), and other metrics were calculated for comparisons of predictive performance between zones.  Results:   For the GS risk classification group, the accuracies of risk classification predictions were 71%, 71%, and 67% using RF and 65%, 64%, and 63% using AdaBoost for zones -1, -2, and -3, respectively. For the PSA group, the accuracies of risk classification predictions were 74%, 65%, and 64% using RF and 76%, 66%, and 67% using AdaBoost for zones -1, -2, and -3, respectively. For the TNM group, the accuracies of risk classification predictions were 68%, 76%, and 78% using RF and 66%, 75%, and 80% using AdaBoost for zones -1, -2, and -3, respectively.

Conclusions:   We proposed three radiomic zones with different standard uptake value characteristics and created four risk groups of prostate cancer patients for testing this idea.

Objectives:   We conducted an experimental case vignette survey that explores whether greater patient involvement in decision-making is likely to influence the intention to complain given different decisions and consequences.  Methods:   Randomized, national case vignette survey with various levels of patient involvement, decisions, and outcomes in a representative Danish sample of men. We used prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening in men aged 45 to 70 years as the intervention illustrated in 30 different versions of a mock clinical encounter. Versions differed in the amount of patient involvement, the decision made (PSA test or no PSA test), and the clinical outcomes (no cancer detected, detection of treatable cancer, and detection of non-treatable cancer). We measured respondents' inclination to complain about care in response to the scenarios on a 5-point Likert scale (from 1: very unlikely to 5: very likely).  Results:   The response rate was 30% (6,756 of 22,288). Across all scenarios, the likelihood of complaint increased if the clinical outcome was poor (untreatable cancer). Compared with scenarios that involved shared decision-making (SDM), neutral information, or nudging in favor of screening, the urge to complain increased if the patient was excluded from decision-making or if the doctor had nudged the patient to decline screening (mean Likert differences .12 to .16, p < .001). With neutral involvement or nudging in favor of intervention, the desire to complain depended highly on the decision reached and on the patient's course. This dependence was smaller with SDM.  Conclusions:   Greater patient involvement in decision-making appears to be associated with less intention to complain about health care, with SDM resulting in the greatest reduction in complaint likelihood.""","""['Søren Birkeland', 'Marie Bismark', 'Michael J Barry', 'Sören Möller']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Personality characteristics associated with satisfaction with healthcare and the wish to complain.', 'Is greater patient involvement associated with higher satisfaction?

Pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) represents the only reliable method, although invasive. A new amino acid PET compound, [18F]-fluciclovine, was recently authorized in suspected PCa recurrence but not yet included in the standard staging work-up of primary PCa. A prospective monocentric study was designed to evaluate [18F]-fluciclovine PET/CT diagnostic performance for preoperative LN staging in primary high-risk PCa.  Methods:   Consecutive patients (pts) with biopsy-proven PCa, standard staging (including [11C]choline PET/CT), eligible for PLND, were enrolled to undergo an investigational [18F]-fluciclovine PET/CT. Nodal uptake higher than surrounding background was reported by at least two readers (blinded to [11C]choline) using a visual 5-point scale (1-2 probably negative; 4-5 probably positive; 3 equivocal); SUVmax, target-to-background (aorta-A; bone marrow-BM) ratios (TBRs), were also calculated. PET results were validated with PLND. [18F]-fluciclovine PET/CT performance using visual score and semi-quantitative indexes was analyzed both per patient and per LN anatomical region, compared to conventional [11C]choline and clinical predictive factors (to note that diagnostic performance of [18F]-fluciclovine was explored for LNM but not examined for intrapelvic or extrapelvic M1 lesions).  Results:   Overall, 94 pts underwent [18F]-fluciclovine PET/CT; 72/94 (77%) high-risk pts were included in the final analyses (22 pts excluded: 8 limited PLND; 3 intermediate-risk; 2 treated with radiotherapy; 4 found to be M1; 5 neoadjuvant hormonal therapy). Median LNM risk by Briganti nomogram was 19%. LNM confirmed on histology was 25% (18/72 pts). Overall, 1671 LN were retrieved; 45/1671 (3%) LNM detected. Per pt, median no. of removed LN was 22 (mean 23 ± 10; range 8-51), of LNM was 2 (mean 3 ± 2; range 1-10). Median LNM size was 5 mm (mean 5 ± 2.5; range 2-10). On patient-based analyses (n = 72), diagnostic performance for LNM resulted significant with [18F]-fluciclovine (AUC 0.66, p 0.04; 50% sensitivity, 81% specificity, 47% PPV, 83% NPV, 74% accuracy), but not with [11C]choline (AUC 0.60, p 0.2; 50%, 70%, 36%, 81%, and 65% respectively). Briganti nomogram (OR = 1.03, p = 0.04) and [18F]-fluciclovine visual score (≥ 4) (OR = 4.27, p = 0.02) resulted independent predictors of LNM at multivariable analyses. On region-based semi-quantitative analyses (n = 576), PET/CT performed better using TBR parameters (TBR-A similar to TBR-BM; TBR-A fluciclovine AUC 0.61, p 0.35, vs choline AUC 0.57 p 0.54; TBR-BM fluciclovine AUC 0.61, p 0.36, vs choline AUC 0.58, p 0.52) rather than using absolute LN SUVmax (fluciclovine AUC 0.51, p 0.91, vs choline AUC 0.51, p 0.94). However, in all cases, diagnostic performance was not statistically significant for LNM detection, although slightly in favor of the experimental tracer [18F]-fluciclovine for each parameter. On the contrary, visual interpretation significantly outperformed PET semi-quantitative parameters (choline and fluciclovine: AUC 0.65 and 0.64 respectively; p 0.03) and represents an independent predictive factor of LNM with both tracers, in particular [18F]-fluciclovine (OR = 8.70, p 0.002, vs OR = 3.98, p = 0.03).

Some commonly used therapies for advanced prostate cancer, such as enzalutamide, have been linked to cognitive impairment, but published data are scarce, come from single-group studies, or focus on self-reported cognition.  Objective:   To longitudinally examine the association between cognitive function and docetaxel (chemotherapy), abiraterone, enzalutamide, and radium Ra 223 dichloride (radium 223) in older men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   A multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study was conducted across 4 academic cancer centers in Ontario, Canada. A consecutive sample of 155 men age 65 years or older with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer starting any treatment with docetaxel, abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, or radium Ra 223 dichloride (radium 223) were enrolled between July 1, 2015, and December 31, 2019.  Exposures:   First-line chemotherapy (docetaxel), abiraterone, enzalutamide, or radium 223.  Main outcomes and measures:   Cognitive function was measured at baseline and end of treatment using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, the Trail Making Test part A, and the Trail Making Test part B to assess global cognition, attention, and executive function, respectively. Absolute changes in scores over time were analyzed using univariate and multivariable linear regression, and the percentages of individuals with a decline of 1.5 SDs in each domain were calculated.  Results:   A total of 155 men starting treatment with docetaxel (n = 51) (mean [SD] age, 73.5 [6.2] years; 34 [66.7%] with some postsecondary education), abiraterone (n = 29) (mean [SD] age, 76.2 [7.2] years; 18 [62.1%] with some postsecondary education), enzalutamide (n = 54) (mean [SD] age, 75.7 [7.4] years; 33 [61.1%] with some postsecondary education), and radium 223 (n = 21) (mean [SD] age, 76.4 [7.2] years; 17 [81.0%] with some postsecondary education) were included. Most patients had stable cognition or slight improvements during treatment. A cognitive decline of 1.5 SDs or more was observed in 0% to 6.5% of patients on each measure of cognitive function (eg, 3 of 46 patients [6.5%; 95% CI, 2.2%-17.5%] in the group receiving chemotherapy [docetaxel] had a decline of 1.5 SDs for Trails A and Trails B). Although patients taking enzalutamide had numerically larger declines than those taking abiraterone, differences were small and clinically unimportant.  Conclusions and relevance:   These findings suggest that most older men do not experience significant cognitive decline in attention, executive function, and global cognition while undergoing treatment for advanced prostate cancer regardless of the treatment used.""","""['Shabbir M H Alibhai', 'Henriette Breunis', 'Gregory Feng', 'Narhari Timilshina', 'Aaron Hansen', 'Padraig Warde', 'Richard Gregg', 'Anthony Joshua', 'Neil Fleshner', 'George Tomlinson', 'Urban Emmenegger']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Error in Key Points.', 'Impact of Abiraterone Acetate plus Prednisone or Enzalutamide on Patient-reported Outcomes in Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Final 12-mo Analysis from the Observational AQUARiUS Study.', 'Efficacy and Safety of Cabazitaxel Versus Abiraterone or Enzalutamide in Older Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer in the CARD Study.', 'Effectiveness of first-line abiraterone versus enzalutamide among\xa0patients ≥80 years of age with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: A retrospective propensity score-weighted comparative cohort study.', 'Treating Patients with Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review of Available Therapies.', 'What do we know about treatment sequencing of abiraterone, enzalutamide, and chemotherapy in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer?', 'Therapeutic potential of targeting mirnas to prostate cancer tumors: using psma as an active target.', 'Metronomic Chemotherapy for Advanced Prostate Cancer: A Literature Review.', 'Assessment and Management of Cognitive Function in Patients with Prostate Cancer Treated with Second-Generation Androgen Receptor Pathway Inhibitors.', 'Error in Key Points.']"""

Nineteen patients were enrolled to receive such treatment. 68Ga-PSMA ligand PET/CT was used to identify rLNs, and 5 mg of ICG was injected into the space between the rectum and bladder before surgery. Fluorescent laparoscopy was used to perform sLND. While extensive LN dissection was performed at level I, another 5 mg of ICG was injected via the intravenous route to intensify the fluorescent signal, and laparoscopy was introduced to intensively target stained LNs along levels I and II, specifically around suspicious LNs, with 68Ga-PSMA ligand PET/CT. Next, both lateral peritonea were exposed longitudinally to facilitate the removal of fluorescently stained LNs at levels III and IV. In total, pathological analysis confirmed that 42 nodes were rLNs. Among 145 positive LNs stained with ICG, 24 suspicious LNs identified with 68Ga-PSMA ligand PET/CT were included. The sensitivity and specificity of 68Ga-PSMA ligand PET/CT for detecting rLNs were 42.9% and 96.6%, respectively. For ICG, the sensitivity was 92.8% and the specificity was 39.1%. At a median follow-up of 15 (interquartile range [IQR]: 6-31) months, 15 patients experienced complete biochemical remission (BR, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] <0.2 ng ml-1), and 4 patients had a decline in the PSA level, but it remained >0.2 ng ml-1.

In the present study, PC3 and LNCaP cells were used to examine the benefits of restoring PPARγ2 activity. PPARγ2 was overexpressed in PC3 and LNCaP cells, and cell proliferation and migration were detected. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was used to detect pathological changes. The genes regulated by PPARγ2 overexpression were detected by microarray analysis. The restoration of PPARγ2 in PC3 and LNCaP cells inhibited cell proliferation and migration. PC3-PPARγ2 tissue recombinants showed necrosis in cancerous regions and leukocyte infiltration in the surrounding stroma by H&E staining. We found higher mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) and lower microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) expression in cancer tissues compared to controls by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining.

However, their clinical translation faces many challenges, one of which is poor delivery to the target tissue in vivo. This problem is particularly evident in solid tumors. Here, we functionalized liposomes with a tumor-homing and -penetrating peptide, iRGD, as a carrier of an ASO against androgen receptor (AR) for prostate cancer treatment. The iRGD-liposomes exhibited a high loading efficiency of AR-ASO, and an efficient knockdown of AR gene products was achieved in vitro, including AR splice variants. In vivo, iRGD-liposomes significantly increased AR-ASO accumulation in the tumor tissue and decreased AR expression relative to free ASOs in prostate tumors established as subcutaneous xenografts. Similar results were obtained with intra-tibial xenografts modeling metastasis to bones, the predominant site of metastasis for prostate cancer. In treatment studies, iRGD-liposomes markedly improved the AR-ASO efficacy in suppressing the growth of both subcutaneous xenografts and intra-tibial xenografts. The inhibitory effect on tumor growth was also significantly prolonged by the delivery of the AR-ASO in the iRGD-liposomes. Meanwhile, iRGD-liposomes did not increase ASO accumulation or toxicity in healthy organs. Overall, we provide here a delivery system that can significantly increase ASO accumulation and efficacy in solid tumors. These benefits are achieved without significant side effects, providing a way to increase the antitumor efficacy of ASOs.""","""['Jibin Guan#', 'Hong Guo#', 'Tang Tang', 'Yihan Wang', 'Yushuang Wei', 'Punit Seth', 'Yingming Li', 'Scott M Dehm', 'Erkki Ruoslahti', 'Hong-Bo Pang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Adv Funct Mater""","""['Versatility of Liposomes for Antisense Oligonucleotide Delivery: A Special Focus on Various Therapeutic Areas.', 'Effects of anti-gene and antisense therapeutics on human prostate cancer xenograft in nude mice.', 'Enhanced Antisense Oligonucleotide Delivery Using Cationic Liposomes Grafted with Trastuzumab: A Proof-of-Concept Study in Prostate Cancer.', 'A comprehensive study of iRGD-modified liposomes with improved chemotherapeutic efficacy on B16 melanoma.', 'The Challenges and Strategies of Antisense Oligonucleotide Drug Delivery.', 'Versatility of Liposomes for Antisense Oligonucleotide Delivery: A Special Focus on Various Therapeutic Areas.', 'Nanoparticle-Based Radioconjugates for Targeted Imaging and Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Current applications of nanomaterials in urinary system tumors.', 'Non-coding RNA regulation of integrins and their potential as therapeutic targets in cancer.', 'Combined Self-Assembled iRGD Polymersomes for Effective Targeted siRNA Anti-Tumor Therapy.']"""

There is potential for drug radiotherapy combinations to improve the therapeutic ratio. We aimed to investigate whether hypoxia-associated genes could be used to identify FDA approved drugs for repurposing for the treatment of hypoxic prostate cancer.  Methods:   Hypoxia associated genes were identified and used in the connectivity mapping software QUADrATIC to identify FDA approved drugs as candidates for repurposing. Drugs identified were tested in vitro in prostate cancer cell lines (DU145, PC3, LNCAP). Cytotoxicity was investigated using the sulforhodamine B assay and radiosensitization using a clonogenic assay in normoxia and hypoxia.  Results:   Menadione and gemcitabine had similar cytotoxicity in normoxia and hypoxia in all three cell lines.

We describe novel nonpeptidic PBD-binding inhibitors, termed abbapolins, identified through successful application of the REPLACE strategy and demonstrate their potent antiproliferative activity in prostate tumors and other cell lines. Furthermore, abbapolins show PLK1-specific binding and inhibitory activity, as measured by a cellular thermal shift assay and an ability to block phosphorylation of TCTP, a validated target of PLK1-mediated kinase activity. Additional evidence for engagement of PLK1 was obtained through the unique observation that abbapolins induce PLK1 degradation in a manner that closely matches antiproliferative activity.

However, a formal demonstration that HVEM can represent a target for cancer immunotherapy is still lacking. Here, we first showed that HVEM and BTLA mRNA expression levels were associated with a worse progression-free interval in patients with prostate adenocarcinomas, indicating a detrimental role for the HVEM/BTLA immune checkpoint during prostate cancer progression. We then showed that administration of a monoclonal antibody to human HVEM resulted in a twofold reduction in the growth of a prostate cancer cell line in NOD.SCID.gc-null mice reconstituted with human T cells. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we showed that the therapeutic effect of the mAb depended on HVEM expression by the tumor, with no effect on graft vs. host disease or activation of human T cells in the spleen. In contrast, the proliferation and number of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes increased following treatment, and depletion of CD8+ T cells partly alleviated treatment's efficacy. The expression of genes belonging to various T cell activation pathways was enriched in tumor-infiltrating leukocytes, whereas genes associated with immuno-suppressive pathways were decreased, possibly resulting in modifications of leukocyte adhesion and motility. Finally, we developed a simple in vivo assay in humanized mice to directly demonstrate that HVEM expressed by the tumor is an immune checkpoint for T cell-mediated tumor control.

The epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) status of primary tumours has relevance to metastatic potential and therapy resistance. Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) provide a window into the metastatic process, and molecular characterisation of CTCs in comparison to their primary tumours could lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the metastatic cascade. In this study, paired blood and tumour samples were collected from four prostate cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models (BM18, LuCaP70, LuCaP96, LuCaP105) and assessed using an EMP-focused, 42 gene human-specific, nested quantitative RT-PCR assay. CTC burden varied amongst the various xenograft models with LuCaP96 having the highest number of CTCs per mouse (mean: 704; median: 31) followed by BM18 (mean: 101; median: 21), LuCaP70 (mean: 73; median: 16) and LuCaP105 (mean: 57; median: 6). A significant relationship was observed between tumour size and CTC number (p = 0.0058). Decreased levels of kallikrein-related peptidase 3 (KLK3) mRNA (which encodes prostate-specific antigen; PSA) were observed in CTC samples from all four models compared to their primary tumours. Both epithelial- and mesenchymal-associated genes were commonly expressed at higher levels in CTCs compared to the bulk primary tumour, although some common EMT-associated genes (CDH1, VIM, EGFR, EPCAM) remained unchanged. Immunofluorescence co-staining for pan-cytokeratin (KRT) and vimentin (VIM) indicated variable proportions of CTCs across the full EMP axis, even in the same model. EMP hybrids predominated in the BM18 and LuCaP96 models, but were not detected in the LuCaP105 model, and variable numbers of KRT+ and human VIM+ cells were observed in each model. SERPINE1, which encodes plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), was enriched at the RNA level in CTCs compared to primary tumours and was the most commonly expressed mesenchymal gene in the CTCs. Co-staining for SERPINE1 and KRT revealed SERPINE1+ cells in 7/11 samples, six of which had SERPINE+KRT+ CTCs. Cell size variation was observed in CTCs. The majority of samples (8/11) contained larger CTCs ranging from 15.3 to 37.8 µm, whilst smaller cells (10.7 ± 4.1 µm, similar in size to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)) were identified in 6 of 11 samples. CTC clusters were also identified in 9/11 samples, containing 2-100 CTCs per cluster. Where CTC heterogeneity was observed in the clusters, epithelial-like cells (KRT+VIM-) were located on the periphery of the cluster, forming a layer around hybrid (KRT+VIM+) or mesenchymal-like (KRT-VIM+) cells. The CTC heterogeneity observed in these models emphasises the complexity in CTC isolation and classification and supports the increasingly recognised importance of the epithelial-mesenchymal hybrid state in cancer progression and metastasis.""","""['Sara Hassan', 'Tony Blick', 'Erik W Thompson', 'Elizabeth D Williams']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancers (Basel)""","""['Circulating Tumour Cells Indicate the Presence of Residual Disease Post-Castration in Prostate Cancer Patient-Derived Xenograft Models.', 'Human-specific RNA analysis shows uncoupled epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity in circulating and disseminated tumour cells from human breast cancer xenografts.', 'Powering single-cell genomics to unravel circulating tumour cell subpopulations in non-small cell lung cancer patients.', 'CTC-Derived Models: A Window into the Seeding Capacity of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs).', 'Targeting epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity in cancer: clinical and preclinical advances in therapy and monitoring.', 'Ex vivo expansion of circulating tumour cells (CTCs).', 'The future of patient-derived xenografts in prostate cancer research.', 'Circulating Tumor Cells as Biomarkers for Renal Cell Carcinoma: Ready for Prime Time?', 'Insights into Circulating Tumor Cell Clusters: A Barometer for Treatment Effects and Prognosis for Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Identification of epithelial and mesenchymal circulating tumor cells in clonal lineage of an aggressive prostate cancer case.']"""

Toward increasing response rates to VTP, we evaluated its efficacy in combination with concurrent PD-1 inhibitor/OX40 agonist immunotherapy in a urothelial tumor-bearing model.  Experimental design:   In mice allografted with MB-49 UTUC cells, we compared the effects of combined VTP with PD-1 inhibitor/OX40 agonist with those of the component treatments on tumor growth, survival, lung metastasis, and antitumor immune responses.  Results:   The combination of VTP with both PD-1 inhibitor and OX40 agonist inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival to a greater degree than VTP with either immunotherapeutic individually. These effects result from increased tumor infiltration and intratumoral proliferation of cytotoxic and helper T cells, depletion of Treg cells, and suppression of myeloid-derived suppressor cells.

Epidemiological studies have shown that patients suffering from either condition present a reduced overall risk of cancer than controls (i.e., inverse comorbidity), suggesting that neurodegeneration provides a protective effect against cancer. Reduced risks of several site-specific tumors, including colorectal, lung, and prostate cancers, have also been observed in AD and PD. By contrast, an increased risk of melanoma has been described in PD patients (i.e., direct comorbidity). Therefore, a fundamental question to address is whether these associations are due to shared genetic and molecular factors or are explained by other phenomena, such as flaws in epidemiological studies, exposure to shared risk factors, or the effect of medications. To this end, we first evaluated the transcriptomes of AD and PD post-mortem brain tissues derived from the hippocampus and the substantia nigra and analyzed their similarities to those of a large panel of 22 site-specific cancers, which were obtained through differential gene expression meta-analyses of array-based studies available in public repositories. Genes and pathways that were deregulated in both disorders in each analyzed pair were examined. Second, we assessed potential genetic links between AD, PD, and the selected cancers by establishing interactome-based overlaps of genes previously linked to each disorder. Then, their genetic correlations were computed using cross-trait LD score regression and GWAS summary statistics data. Finally, the potential role of medications in the reported comorbidities was assessed by comparing disease-specific differential gene expression profiles to an extensive collection of differential gene expression signatures generated by exposing cell lines to drugs indicated for AD, PD, and cancer treatment (LINCS L1000). We identified significant inverse associations of transcriptomic deregulation between AD hippocampal tissues and breast, lung, liver, and prostate cancers, and between PD substantia nigra tissues and breast, lung, and prostate cancers. Moreover, significant direct (same direction) associations of deregulation were observed between AD and PD and brain and thyroid cancers, as well as between PD and kidney cancer. Several biological processes, including the immune system, oxidative phosphorylation, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, and the cell cycle, were found to be deregulated in both cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Significant genetic correlations were found between PD and melanoma and prostate cancers. Several drugs indicated for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders and cancer, such as galantamine, selegiline, exemestane, and estradiol, were identified as potential modulators of the comorbidities observed between neurodegeneration and cancer.""","""['Jaume Forés-Martos', 'Cesar Boullosa', 'David Rodrigo-Domínguez', 'Jon Sánchez-Valle', 'Beatriz Suay-García', 'Joan Climent', 'Antonio Falcó', 'Alfonso Valencia', 'Joan Anton Puig-Butillé', 'Susana Puig', 'Rafael Tabarés-Seisdedos']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancers (Basel)""","""[""Investigation of Shared Genetic Risk Factors Between Parkinson's Disease and Cancers."", 'Transcriptomic metaanalyses of autistic brains reveals shared gene expression and biological pathway abnormalities with cancer.', ""Therapeutic potentials of plant iridoids in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases: A review."", ""Pathways to neurodegeneration: mechanistic insights from GWAS in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and related disorders."", 'Common Factors in Neurodegeneration: A Meta-Study Revealing Shared Patterns on a Multi-Omics Scale.', ""Longitudinal study of the inverse relationship between Parkinson's disease and cancer in Korea."", 'Metabolomic analysis of vascular cognitive impairment due to hepatocellular carcinoma.', ""Parkinson's Disease, Parkinsonisms, and Mitochondria: the Role of Nuclear and Mitochondrial DNA."", ""Neurotherapeutic Effects of Quercetin and Its Metabolite Compounds on Cognitive Impairment and Parkinson's Disease: An In Silico Study."", ""Investigation of Shared Genetic Risk Factors Between Parkinson's Disease and Cancers.""]"""

In this study, we developed optimized silica-coated silver-assembled silica nanoparticles (SiO2@Ag@SiO2 NPs) that were applied to a visual lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) platform for PSA detection. During synthesis, the ratio of silica NPs to silver nitrate changed, and as the synthesized NPs exhibited distinct UV spectra and colors, most optimized SiO2@Ag@SiO2 NPs showed the potential for early prostate cancer diagnosis. The PSA detection limit of our LFIA platform was 1.1 ng/mL. By applying each SiO2@Ag@SiO2 NP to the visual LFIA platform, optimized SiO2@Ag@SiO2 NPs were selected in the test strip, and clinical samples from prostate cancer patients were successfully detected as the boundaries of non-specific binding were clearly seen and the level of PSA was <4 ng/mL, thus providing an avenue for quick prostate cancer diagnosis and early treatment.""","""['Hyung-Mo Kim', 'Jaehi Kim', 'Sungje Bock', 'Jaehyun An', 'Yun-Sik Choi', 'Xuan-Hung Pham', 'Myeong Geun Cha', 'Bomi Seong', 'Wooyeon Kim', 'Yoon-Hee Kim', 'Hobeom Song', 'Jung-Won Kim', 'Seung-Min Park', 'Sang Hun Lee', 'Won-Yeop Rho', 'Sangchul Lee', 'Dae Hong Jeong', 'Ho-Young Lee', 'Bong-Hyun Jun']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Sensors (Basel)""","""['Lateral Flow Immunoassay with Quantum-Dot-Embedded Silica Nanoparticles for Prostate-Specific Antigen Detection.', 'Au-Ag assembled on silica nanoprobes for visual semiquantitative detection of prostate-specific antigen.', 'Metal-enhanced fluorescent dye-doped silica nanoparticles and magnetic separation: A sensitive platform for one-step fluorescence detection of prostate specific antigen.', 'Competitive Lateral Flow Immunoassay Relying on Au-SiO2 Janus Nanoparticles with an Asymmetric Structure and Function for Furazolidone Residue Monitoring.', 'Recent advances in gold nanoparticle-based lateral flow immunoassay for the detection of bacterial infection.', 'Silica Encapsulation of Hydrophobic Optical NP-Embedded Silica Particles with Trimethoxy(2-Phenylethyl)silane.', 'Latest Trends in Lateral Flow Immunoassay (LFIA) Detection Labels and Conjugation Process.', 'Lateral Flow Immunoassay with Quantum-Dot-Embedded Silica Nanoparticles for Prostate-Specific Antigen Detection.']"""

Carriers of pathogenic changes in mismatch repair (MMR) genes have an increased risk of developing colorectal (CRC), endometrial, ovarian, urinary tract, prostate, and other cancers, depending on which gene is malfunctioning. In Lynch syndrome, differences in cancer incidence (penetrance) according to the gene involved have led to the stratification of cancer surveillance. By contrast, any differences in penetrance determined by the type of pathogenic variant remain unknown.  Objective:   To determine cumulative incidences of cancer in carriers of truncating and missense or aberrant splicing pathogenic variants of the MLH1 and MSH2 genes.  Methods:   Carriers of pathogenic variants of MLH1 (path_MLH1) and MSH2 (path_MSH2) genes filed in the Prospective Lynch Syndrome Database (PLSD) were categorized as truncating or missense/aberrant splicing according to the InSiGHT criteria for pathogenicity.  Results:   Among 5199 carriers, 1045 had missense or aberrant splicing variants, and 3930 had truncating variants. Prospective observation years for the two groups were 8205 and 34,141 years, respectively, after which there were no significant differences in incidences for cancer overall or for colorectal cancer or endometrial cancers separately.

Many cancers including prostate, lung, and ovarian secrete a protein disulfide isomerase protein named AGR2 that has been previously detected in urine and plasma using mass spectrometry. Here we determine whether a previously developed monoclonal antibody targeting AGR2 can be adapted from an indirect two-site ELISA format into a direct detector using solid-phase printed gold electrodes. The screen-printed gold electrode was surface functionalized with the anti-AGR2 specific monoclonal antibody. The interaction of the recombinant AGR2 protein and the anti-AGR2 monoclonal antibody functionalized electrode changed its electrochemical impedance spectra. Nyquist diagrams were obtained after incubation in an increasing concentration of purified AGR2 protein with a range of concentrations from 0.01 fg/mL to 10 fg/mL. In addition, detection of the AGR2 antigen can be achieved from cell lysates in medium or artificial buffer. These data highlight the utility of an AGR2-specific monoclonal antibody that can be functionalized onto a gold printed electrode for a one-step capture and quantitation of the target antigen.

This study is designed to evaluate if the combination of aPPD with calcitriol can inhibit human prostate cancer xenograft growth by using nuclear receptor signaling. Athymic male nude mice were utilized to establish an androgen-independent human prostate cancer C4-2 cell castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) xenograft model. Mice were treated orally for six weeks with 70 mg/kg aPPD administered once daily or three times per week with 4 µg/kg calcitriol or in combination or only with vehicle control. Contrary to our expectations, calcitriol treatment alone increased C4-2 tumor growth. However, the addition of calcitriol substantially increased aPPD-mediated tumor growth suppression (76% vs. 53%, combination vs. aPPD alone). The combination treatment significantly increased levels of cleaved caspase-3 apoptotic marker compared to vehicle-treated or aPPD-treated C4-2 tumors. The mechanistic elucidations indicate that tumor inhibition by the aPPD and calcitriol combination was accompanied by elevated vitamin D receptor (VDR) protein expression. In silico data suggest that aPPD weakly binds to the native LBD pocket of VDR. Interestingly, the combination of aPPD and calcitriol activated VDR at a significantly higher level than calcitriol alone and this indicates that aPPD may be an allosteric activator of VDR. Overall, aPPD and calcitriol combination significantly inhibited tumor growth in vivo with no acute or chronic toxic effects in the C4-2 xenograft CRPC nude mice. The involvement of VDR and downstream apoptotic pathways are potential mechanistic routes of antitumor effects of this combination.""","""['Mohamed Ben-Eltriki', 'Subrata Deb', 'Gehana Shankar', 'Gray Meckling', 'Mohamed Hassona', 'Takeshi Yamazaki', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Mei Yieng Chin', 'Emma S Tomlinson Guns']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Medicines (Basel)""","""['Calcitriol and 20(S)-protopanaxadiol synergistically inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Pharmacokinetic interaction of calcitriol with 20(S)-protopanaxadiol in mice: Determined by LC/MS analysis.', '20(S)-protopanaxadiol regio-selectively targets androgen receptor: anticancer effects in castration-resistant prostate tumors.', 'Vitamin D in Prostate Cancer.', 'Vitamin D-related therapies in prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   Men who underwent RP for treating PCa between 2013-2015 were identified. Cancer-free men ≥45 years with and without benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) were used as controls. Longitudinal data on ICD-diagnoses, type of surgery, prescribed incontinence pads, and hospitals' surgery volumes were aggregated between 2011-2018 to capture pre- and up to three years post-RP follow-up. Monthly rates of pad use were calculated and compared between RP types and cancer-free controls.  Results:   A total of 6248 RP patients, 7158 cancer-free men with BPH, and 50,257 cancer-free men without BPH were analyzed. Comparing to pre-RP (0.03, 95%CI: 0.02-0.05), RP resulted in significantly higher rates of prescribed pads (at 3 months: 12.61, 95%CI: 11.59-13.65; 12 months: 6.71, 95%CI: 6.10-7.34; 36 months: 4.91, 95%CI: 3.76-4.62). These rates were also higher than those for cancer free controls (with BPH:0.06, 95%CI: 0.04-0.09; without BPH:0.12, 95%CI: 0.10-0.14). The rate of prescribed pads after surgery continued to decline over time and remained higher among men who underwent minimally invasive RP compared to those who underwent an open procedure.  Conclusion:   Despite progress in surgical techniques, post-RP incontinence remains a prevalent adverse event. The rate of pad usage steadily improved over the first three years post RP. The rate of patients with incontinence needing pads was higher among those who were treated minimally invasive compared to open approach.""","""['Dong-Ho Mun', 'Lin Yang', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Sylvia Reitter-Pfoertner', 'Gerald Gredinger', 'Thomas Waldhoer']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Environ Res Public Health""","""['Long-term oncological and continence outcomes after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a single-centre experience.', 'Degree of preservation of the neurovascular bundles during radical prostatectomy and urinary continence 1 year after surgery.', 'Prevalence of Postprostatectomy Incontinence Requiring Anti-incontinence Surgery After Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer: A Retrospective Population-Based Analysis.', 'Surgery for stress urinary incontinence due to presumed sphincter deficiency after prostate surgery.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.']"""

However, only a few of them have been transferred into clinical practice so far. The present study aimed to identify and validate novel DNA methylation biomarkers for PCa diagnosis and prognosis. Microarray-based methylome data of well-characterized cancerous and noncancerous prostate tissue (NPT) pairs was used for the initial screening. Ten protein-coding genes were selected for validation in a set of 151 PCa, 51 NPT, as well as 17 benign prostatic hyperplasia samples. The Prostate Cancer Dataset (PRAD) of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was utilized for independent validation of our findings. Methylation frequencies of ADAMTS12, CCDC181, FILIP1L, NAALAD2, PRKCB, and ZMIZ1 were up to 91% in our study. PCa specific methylation of ADAMTS12, CCDC181, NAALAD2, and PRKCB was demonstrated by qualitative and quantitative means (all p < 0.05). In agreement with PRAD, promoter methylation of these four genes was associated with the transcript down-regulation in the Lithuanian cohort (all p < 0.05). Methylation of ADAMTS12, NAALAD2, and PRKCB was independently predictive for biochemical disease recurrence, while NAALAD2 and PRKCB increased the prognostic power of multivariate models (all p < 0.01).

A total of 17 patients were included and 14 patients completed both baseline and follow-up uPAR-PET/CT. Baseline SUVmax of the index lesion was associated with OS; hazard ratio 2.51 (95% CI: 1.01-6.28, p = 0.05) per unit increase in SUVmax.

To discover key molecular changes in PCa development and metastasis, we analyzed microarray data of localized PCa, metastatic PCa and normal prostate tissue samples from clinical specimens.  Methods:   Gene expression profiling datasets of PCa were analyzed online. The DAVID was used to perform GO functional and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. CytoHubba in Cytoscape software was applied to identify hub genes. Survival data were downloaded from GEPIA. Gene expression data were obtained from ONCOMINE and UALCAN.  Results:   We obtained 4 sets of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), DEGs 1: a comparison of the gene expression between 4 normal prostate and 5 localized PCa samples in GSE27616; DEGs 2: a comparison of the gene expression between 6 normal prostate and 7 localized PCa samples in GSE3325; DEGs 3: a comparison of the gene expression between 5 localized PCa and 4 metastatic PCa samples in GSE27616; DEGs 4: a comparison of the gene expression between 7 localized PCa and 6 metastatic PCa samples in GSE3325. A comparison of these 4 sets of genes revealed 51 overlapped genes. GO function analysis revealed enrichment of the 51 DEGs in functions related to the proteinaceous extracellular matrix and centrosome, protein homodimerization activity and chromatin binding were the main functions of these genes, which participated in regulating cell division, mitotic nuclear division, proteinaceous extracellular matrix, cell adhesion and apoptotic process. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that these identified DEGs were mainly enriched in progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, oocyte meiosis and cell cycle. We defined the 16 genes with the highest degree of connectivity as the hub genes in the 51 overlapped DEGs. Cox regression revealed TOP2A, CCNB2, BUB1, CDK1 and EZH2 were related to Disease-free survival (DFS). The expression levels of the 5 genes were 2.232-, 1.786-, 2.303-, 1.699-, and 1.986-fold higher in PCa than the levels in normal tissues, respectively (P < 0.05). We obtained 20 hub genes from DEGs by the comparison of normal prostate tissue vs. localized cancer tissue. Among them, KIF20A, CDKN3, PBK and CDCA2, were expressed higher in PCa than in normal tissues, and were associated with the DFS of PCa patients. Meanwhile, we obtained 20 hub genes from DEGs by the comparison of localized cancer tissue vs. metastatic cancer tissue. Cox regression revealed PLK1, CCNA2 and CDC20, were associated with both the DFS and overall survival of PCa patients.  Conclusions:   The results suggested that the functions of KIF20A, CDKN3, PBK and CDCA2 may contribute to PCa development and the functions of PLK1, CCNA2 and CDC20 may contribute to PCa metastasis.

A multiparameter gene expression profiling-based tumor inflammation assay may offer robust characterization of the tumor microenvironment, thereby extending the utility of single-gene analysis or immunohistochemistry (IHC) in predicting response to ICIs. The authors interrogated 1778 commercially procured, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples using gene expression profiling and pathology-assisted digital CD8 IHC. A machine-learning approach was used to develop gene expression signatures that predicted CD8+ immune cell abundance as surrogates for tumor inflammation in melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck samples. An assay for a 16-gene CD8 signature was developed and analytically validated across 12 tumor types. CD8 signature scores correlated with CD8 IHC in a platform-independent manner, and inflammation prevalence was similar between assay methods for all tumor types except prostate cancer and small cell lung cancer. In retrospective analyses, CD8 signature scores were associated with progression-free survival and overall survival with nivolumab in patients with urothelial carcinoma from CheckMate 275.

Methods:   Between September 21, 2005, and January 13, 2015, we randomly assigned 350 men 1:1 with T1c-4N0M0 unfavorable-risk PC to receive radiation therapy (RT) and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) plus docetaxel (60 mg/m2 once every 3 weeks for three cycles before RT and 20 mg/m2 once weekly during RT) versus ADT + RT. We evaluated the treatment effect of adding docetaxel to ADT + RT on the primary end point of overall survival (OS) and the incidence of RT-induced cancers and explored whether the impact of the treatment effect on OS differed within prostate-specific antigen (PSA) subgroups (< 4, > 20 v 4-20 ng/mL) using the interaction test for heterogeneity adjusted for age and PC prognostic factors.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 10.2 years, 89 men died (25.43%); of these, 42 from PC (47.19%). Although OS was not significantly increased in the docetaxel arm (the restricted mean survival time over 10 years was 9.11 v 8.82 years; P = .22), significantly fewer RT-induced cancers were observed (10-year estimates: 0.61% v 4.90%; age-adjusted hazard ratio of 0.13; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.97; P = .046). The treatment effect of adding docetaxel to ADT + RT on OS significantly differed in men with a PSA < 4 ng/mL versus 4-20 ng/mL (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.27 and 1.51, respectively) because of less PC-specific mortality on the docetaxel arm (0.00% v 28.57%) among men with PSA < 4 ng/mL.  Conclusion:   Adding docetaxel to ADT + RT did not prolong OS in men with unfavorable-risk PC, but decreased RT-induced cancer incidence, and may prolong OS in the subgroup of men with a PSA < 4 ng/mL by reducing PC-specific mortality.""","""[""Anthony V D'Amico"", 'Wanling Xie', 'Elizabeth McMahon', 'Marian Loffredo', 'Shana Medeiros', 'David Joseph', 'Jim Denham', 'Parvesh Kumar', 'Glenn Bubley', 'Molly Sullivan', 'Richard Hellwig', 'Juan Carlos Vera', 'Rolf Freter', 'W Jeffrey Baker', 'Jeffrey Y Wong', 'Andrew A Renshaw', 'Philip W Kantoff']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Reply to G.

Objective:   To compare clinical outcomes among patients with high-risk prostate cancer after definitive treatment.  Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective cohort study included patients with high-risk prostate cancer (as defined by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN]) and at least 1 adverse clinicopathologic feature (defined as any primary Gleason pattern 5 on biopsy, clinical T3b-4 disease, ≥50% cores with biopsy results positive for prostate cancer, or NCCN ≥2 high-risk features) treated between 2000 and 2014 at 16 tertiary centers. Data were analyzed in November 2020.  Exposures:   Radical prostatectomy (RP), external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), or EBRT plus brachytherapy boost (BT) with ADT. Guideline-concordant multimodal treatment was defined as RP with appropriate use of multimodal therapy (optimal RP), EBRT with at least 2 years of ADT (optimal EBRT), or EBRT with BT with at least 1 year ADT (optimal EBRT with BT).  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcome was prostate cancer-specific mortality; distant metastasis was a secondary outcome. Differences were evaluated using inverse probability of treatment weight-adjusted Fine-Gray competing risk regression models.  Results:   A total of 6004 men (median [interquartile range] age, 66.4 [60.9-71.8] years) with high-risk prostate cancer were analyzed, including 3175 patients (52.9%) who underwent RP, 1830 patients (30.5%) who underwent EBRT alone, and 999 patients (16.6%) who underwent EBRT with BT. Compared with RP, treatment with EBRT with BT (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR] 0.78, [95% CI, 0.63-0.97]; P = .03) or with EBRT alone (sHR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.53-0.92]; P = .01) was associated with significantly improved prostate cancer-specific mortality; there was no difference in prostate cancer-specific mortality between EBRT with BT and EBRT alone (sHR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.67-1.18]; P = .43). No significant differences in prostate cancer-specific mortality were found across treatment cohorts among 2940 patients who received guideline-concordant multimodality treatment (eg, optimal EBRT alone vs optimal RP: sHR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.52-1.09]; P = .14). However, treatment with EBRT alone or EBRT with BT was consistently associated with lower rates of distant metastasis compared with treatment with RP (eg, EBRT vs RP: sHR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.44-0.58]; P < .001).  Conclusions and relevance:   These findings suggest that among patients with high-risk prostate cancer and additional unfavorable clinicopathologic features receiving guideline-concordant multimodal therapy, prostate cancer-specific mortality outcomes were equivalent among those treated with RP, EBRT, and EBRT with BT, although distant metastasis outcomes were more favorable among patients treated with EBRT and EBRT with BT. Optimal multimodality treatment is critical for improving outcomes in patients with high-risk prostate cancer.""","""['Amar U Kishan', 'R Jeffrey Karnes', 'Tahmineh Romero', 'Jessica K Wong', 'Giovanni Motterle', 'Jeffrey J Tosoian', 'Bruce J Trock', 'Eric A Klein', 'Bradley J Stish', 'Robert T Dess', 'Daniel E Spratt', 'Avinash Pilar', 'Chandana Reddy', 'Rebecca Levin-Epstein', 'Trude B Wedde', 'Wolfgang A Lilleby', 'Ryan Fiano', 'Gregory S Merrick', 'Richard G Stock', 'D Jeffrey Demanes', 'Brian J Moran', 'Michelle Braccioforte', 'Hartwig Huland', 'Phuoc T Tran', 'Santiago Martin', 'Rafael Martínez-Monge', 'Daniel J Krauss', 'Eyad I Abu-Isa', 'Ridwan Alam', 'Zeyad Schwen', 'Albert J Chang', 'Thomas M Pisansky', 'Richard Choo', 'Daniel Y Song', 'Stephen Greco', 'Curtiland Deville', 'Todd McNutt', 'Theodore L DeWeese', 'Ashley E Ross', 'Jay P Ciezki', 'Paul C Boutros', 'Nicholas G Nickols', 'Prashant Bhat', 'David Shabsovich', 'Jesus E Juarez', 'Natalie Chong', 'Patrick A Kupelian', ""Anthony V D'Amico"", 'Matthew B Rettig', 'Alejandro Berlin', 'Jonathan D Tward', 'Brian J Davis', 'Robert E Reiter', 'Michael L Steinberg', 'David Elashoff', 'Eric M Horwitz', 'Rahul D Tendulkar', 'Derya Tilki']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['External Beam Radiation Therapy With or Without Brachytherapy Boost in Men With Very-High-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Large Multicenter International Consortium Analysis.', 'Clinical Outcomes for Patients with Gleason Score 9-10 Prostate Adenocarcinoma Treated With Radiotherapy or Radical Prostatectomy: A Multi-institutional Comparative Analysis.', 'Interplay Between Duration of Androgen Deprivation Therapy and External Beam Radiotherapy With or Without a Brachytherapy Boost for Optimal Treatment of High-risk Prostate Cancer: A Patient-Level Data Analysis of 3 Cohorts.', 'Radiation therapy compared to radical prostatectomy as first-line definitive therapy for patients with high-risk localised prostate cancer: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Low-dose rate brachytherapy for men with localized prostate cancer.', 'Radiation Facility Volume and Survival for Men With Very High-Risk Prostate Cancer Treated with Radiation and Androgen Deprivation Therapy.', 'How To Manage T3b Prostate Cancer in the Contemporary Era: Referee Position.', 'Influence of adjuvant vs early salvage radiotherapy on lethality in men with high risk for recurrence following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed data from 368 patients who underwent surgery for PC or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) between 2010 and 2020 at the Department of Urology, University of Catania. Tissue microarray slides were constructed and they were stained for androgen receptor (AR), insulin receptor-α and -β, IGF1 (IGF1-R), Ki-67, and prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression using validated score.  Results:   The final cohort was represented by 100 patients with BPH and 268 with PC, with a median age of 68 years. We found that SRSF-1 expression was associated with AR (odds ratio [OR]: 1.66), PSMA (OR: 2.13), Ki-67 (OR: 5.99), insulin receptor (IR)-α (OR: 2.38), IR-β (OR: 3.48), IGF1-R (OR: 1.53), and microvascular density (MVD) was associated with PSMA (OR: 3.44), Ki-67 (OR: 2.23), IR-α (OR: 2.91), IR-β (OR: 3.02), IGF1-R (OR: 2.95), and SRSF-1 (OR: 2.21).

Overall, the most biologically active extract of Peganum harmala (seeds) exhibited significant cytotoxic activity on Artemia salina with LC50 value of 61.547 µg/mL, while P. harmala (roots) [LC50 = 124.229 µg/mL] and M. azedarach (fruits) [LC50 = 147.813 µg/mL] showed moderate cytotoxic potential. P. harmala (seeds) extract also showed the maximum antitumor potential with 52.278 µg/mL LC50. Branches of P. harmala and Morus alba were not active in both bioassays. These outcomes were further reinforced by the levels of phenolics and flavonoids checked against gallic acid and quercetin equivalents, respectively, by standard curves. Current study aims to isolate, structurally characterize and analyze the bioactive compound from plant extracts by using chromatographic and spectrophotometric techniques. Bioactivity guided isolation of extracts led to the isolation of PH-HM-16 from ethyl acetate fraction P. harmala seeds. Chemical structure of PH-HM-16 was elucidated by ESI-MS, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, HSQC and IR spectrum. The results demonstrated significant positive anticancer activities against six human cancer cell lines assessed through MTT cancer cell growth inhibition assay. PH-HM-16 was most effective against prostate cancer cell lines [IC50 = 17.63 µg/mL] followed by breast cancer cell line MCF7 [IC50 value of 41.81 µg/mL]. IC50 value of PH-HM-16 against human myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60 and human colorectal tumor cells HCT-116 was observed as 68.77 µg/mL and 71.54 µg/mL respectively. The IC 50 value of PH-HM-16 compound was not significant against human gastric cancer SGC-7901 (111.89 µg/mL) and human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line A549 (176.04 µg/mL). Isolated bioactive metabolite PH-HM-16 possesses significant antitumor potential so this could be the first step to develop an effective anticancer agent.

Although immunotherapy with the Food and Drug Administration-approved vaccine sipuleucel-T, which targets prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), extends survival for 2-4 months, the identification of new immunogenic tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) continues to be an unmet need.  Methods:   We evaluated the differential expression profile of castration-resistant prostate epithelial cells that give rise to CRPC from mice following an androgen deprivation/repletion cycle. The expression levels of a set of androgen-responsive genes were further evaluated in prostate, brain, colon, liver, lung, skin, kidney, and salivary gland from murine and human databases. The expression of a novel prostate-restricted TAA was then validated by immunostaining of mouse tissues and analyzed in primary tumors across all human cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Finally, the immunogenicity of this TAA was evaluated in vitro and in vivo using autologous coculture assays with cells from healthy donors as well as by measuring antigen-specific antibodies in sera from patients with prostate cancer (PCa) from a neoadjuvant clinical trial.  Results:   We identified a set of androgen-responsive genes that could serve as potential TAAs for PCa. In particular, we found transglutaminase 4 (Tgm4) to be highly expressed in prostate tumors that originate from luminal epithelial cells and only expressed at low levels in most extraprostatic tissues evaluated. Furthermore, elevated levels of TGM4 expression in primary PCa tumors correlated with unfavorable prognosis in patients. In vitro and in vivo assays confirmed the immunogenicity of TGM4. We found that activated proinflammatory effector memory CD8 and CD4 T cells were expanded by monocyte-derived dendritic cell (moDCs) pulsed with TGM4 to a greater extent than moDCs pulsed with either PAP or prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and T cells primed with TGM4-pulsed moDCs produce functional cytokines following a prime/boost regiment or in vitro stimulation. An IgG antibody response to TGM4 was detected in 30% of vaccinated patients, while fewer than 8% of vaccinated patients developed antibody responses to PSA or prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA).

However, this has also led to an increased number of biopsies in order to establish the diagnosis, many of them unnecessary. Current screening guidelines prioritize use of prostatic magnetic resonance and new biomarkers to reduce unnecessary biopsies, however, their implementation in developing countries screening programs is mainly limited by its costs.  Objective:   We aimed to evaluate Prostate Biopsy Risk Collaborative Group (PBCG) and Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial Risk Calculator (PCPTRC) 2.0 predictions accuracy in Mexican patients in order to guide prostate biopsy decision making and reduce unnecessary biopsies.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed patients between 55 and 90 years old who underwent prostate biopsy in a high-volume center in Mexico between January 2017 and June 2020. Clinical utility of PBCG and PCPTRC 2.0 to predict high-grade prostate cancer (HGPCa) biopsy outcomes was evaluated using decision curve analysis and compared to actual biopsy decision making. Receiver operating characteristics area under the curve (AUC) was used to measure discrimination and external validation.  Results:   From 687 patients eligible for prostate biopsy, 433 met selections criteria. One hundred and thirty-five (31.17%) patients were diagnosed with HGPCa, 63 (14.54%) with low-grade disease and 235 (54.27%) had a negative biopsy. PCPTRC 2.0 ≥15% threshold got a standardized net benefit (sNB) of 0.70, while PBCG ≥30% and ≥35% had a sNB of 0.27 and 0.15, respectively. Use of both models for guiding prostate biopsy decision resulted in no statistical difference for HGCPa detection rates, while achieved a significant difference in reducing total and unnecessary biopsies. However, this difference was lower (better) for PCPTRC 2.0, being statistically significative when compared against PBCG thresholds. Both models were well calibrated (AUC 0.79) and achieved external validation compared with international cohorts.  Conclusions:   Our study is the first to effectively validate both PCPTRC 2.0 and PBCG predictions for the Mexican population, proving that their use in daily practice improves biopsy decision making by accurately predicting HGPCa and limit unnecessary biopsies without representing additional costs to screening programs.""","""['Eduardo Amaya-Fragoso', 'Carlos Marcel García-Pérez']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['A Contemporary Prostate Biopsy Risk Calculator Based on Multiple Heterogeneous Cohorts.', 'Prostate cancer risk prediction in a urology clinic in Mexico.', 'Predicting Biopsy Outcomes During Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: External Validation of the Canary Prostate Active Surveillance Study Risk Calculators in Five Large Active Surveillance Cohorts.', 'Urine TMPRSS2:ERG Plus PCA3 for Individualized Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment.', 'New trends in prostate cancer diagnostics.', 'Accommodating heterogeneous missing data patterns for prostate cancer risk prediction.']"""

Methods and materials:   A list of failure modes was compiled and scored independently by 8 brachytherapy physicists on a one-to-ten scale for severity (S), occurrence (O), and detectability (D), with risk priority number (RPN) = SxOxD. Variability of RPNs across observers (standard deviation/average) was calculated. Six idealized HDRPB plans were generated, and error simulations were performed: single (N = 1722) and systematic (N = 126) catheter shifts (craniocaudal; -1cm:1 cm); single catheter digitization errors (tip and connector needle-tips displaced independently in random directions; 0.1 cm:0.5 cm; N = 44,318); and swaps (two catheters swapped during digitization or connection; N = 528). The deviations due to each error in prostate D90%, urethra D20%, and rectum D1cm3 were analyzed using two thresholds: 5-20% (possible clinical impact) and >20% (potentially reportable events).  Results:   Twenty-nine relevant failure modes were described. Overall, RPNs ranged from 6 to 108 (average ± 1 standard deviation, 46 ± 23), with responder variability ranging from 19% to 184% (average 75% ± 30%). Potentially reportable events were observed in the simulations for systematic shifts >0.4 cm for prostate and digitization errors >0.3 cm for the urethra and >0.4 cm for rectum. Possible clinical impact was observed for catheter swaps (all organs), systematic shifts >0.2 cm for prostate and >0.4 cm for rectum, and digitization errors >0.2 cm for prostate and >0.1 cm for urethra and rectum.

A better understanding of the tumor biology in bone metastases is needed to guide further treatment developments. Subgroups of PC bone metastases based on transcriptome profiling have been previously identified by our research team, and specifically, heterogeneities related to androgen receptor (AR) activity have been described. Epigenetic alterations during PC progression remain elusive and this study aims to explore promoter gene methylation signatures in relation to gene expression and tumor AR activity.  Materials and methods:   Genome-wide promoter-associated CpG methylation signatures of a total of 94 tumor samples, including paired non-malignant and malignant primary tumor areas originating from radical prostatectomy samples (n = 12), and bone metastasis samples of separate patients with hormone-naive (n = 14), short-term castrated (n = 4) or CRPC (n = 52) disease were analyzed using the Infinium Methylation EPIC arrays, along with gene expression analysis by Illumina Bead Chip arrays (n = 90). AR activity was defined from expression levels of genes associated with canonical AR activity.  Results:   Integrated epigenome and transcriptome analysis identified pronounced hypermethylation in malignant compared to non-malignant areas of localized prostate tumors. Metastases showed an overall hypomethylation in relation to primary PC, including CpGs in the AR promoter accompanied with induction of AR mRNA levels. We identified a Methylation Classifier for Androgen receptor activity (MCA) signature, which separated metastases into two clusters (MCA positive/negative) related to tumor characteristics and patient prognosis. The MCA positive metastases showed low methylation levels of genes associated with canonical AR signaling and patients had a more favorable prognosis after ADT. In contrast, MCA negative patients had low AR activity associated with hypermethylation of AR-associated genes, and a worse prognosis after ADT.  Conclusions:   A promoter methylation signature classifies PC bone metastases into two groups and predicts tumor AR activity and patient prognosis after ADT. The explanation for the methylation diversities observed during PC progression and their biological and clinical relevance need further exploration.""","""['Erik Bovinder Ylitalo#', 'Elin Thysell#', 'Mattias Landfors#', 'Maria Brattsand', 'Emma Jernberg', 'Sead Crnalic', 'Anders Widmark', 'Magnus Hultdin', 'Anders Bergh', 'Sofie Degerman#', 'Pernilla Wikström#']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Clin Epigenetics""","""['Expression of androgen receptor splice variants in prostate cancer bone metastases is associated with castration-resistance and short survival.', 'Subgroups of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases Defined Through an Inverse Relationship Between Androgen Receptor Activity and Immune Response.', 'Gene expression profiles define molecular subtypes of prostate cancer bone metastases with different outcomes and morphology traceable back to the primary tumor.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Interplay between genomic alterations and androgen receptor signaling during prostate cancer development and progression.', 'meth-SemiCancer: a cancer subtype classification framework via semi-supervised learning utilizing DNA methylation profiles.', 'HiTAIC: hierarchical tumor artificial intelligence classifier traces tissue of origin and tumor type in primary and metastasized tumors using DNA methylation.', 'Androgen Receptor Signaling Inhibition in Advanced Castration Resistance Prostate Cancer: What Is Expected for the Near Future?', 'Epithelial and Stromal Characteristics of Primary Tumors Predict the Bone Metastatic Subtype of Prostate Cancer and Patient Survival after Androgen-Deprivation Therapy.', 'Prostate cancer in omics era.']"""

Methods:   Clinical data of 80 consecutive oligometastatic patients with 115 bone lesions receiving MDT between 2011 and 2019 were retrospectively evaluated. Hormone-sensitive (77.5%) and castrate-resistant (22.5%) patients were included. MDT was delivered with conventional fractionated or stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) techniques. Kaplan-Meier method, log rank test, as well as Cox regression were used to calculate local control (LC) and biochemical and clinical progression-free survival (bPFS/cPFS).  Results:   At the time of MDT 31% of patients had de-novo synchronous oligometastatic disease, 46% had de-novo metachronous oligorecurrence after primary treatment and 23% had either de-novo oligoprogressive disease, repeat oligometastatic disease or induced oligometastatic disease. The median BED3 was 93.3 Gy (range 75.8-95.3 Gy). Concomitant ADT was administered in 69% of patients. After a median follow-up of 23 months the median bPFS and cPFS were 16.5 and 21.5 months, respectively. The 2-year LC rate was 98.3%. In multivariate analysis, age ≤ 70 (HR = 2.60, 95% CI 1.20-5.62, p = 0.015) and concomitant ADT (HR = 0.26, 95% CI 0.12-0.58, p = 0.001) significantly correlated with cPFS.

Here we investigated whether these kinases interact with each other to influence AMPK activation and tumorigenic growth of prostate and breast cancer cells.  Methods:   We first determined how PIM and LKB1 kinases affect AMPK phosphorylation levels. We then used in vitro kinase assays to demonstrate that LKB1 is phosphorylated by PIM kinases, and site-directed mutagenesis to identify the PIM target sites in LKB1. The cellular functions of PIM and LKB1 kinases were evaluated using either pan-PIM inhibitors or CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing, with which all three PIM family members and/or LKB1 were knocked out from PC3 prostate and MCF7 breast cancer cell lines. In addition to cell proliferation assays, we examined the effects of PIM and/or LKB1 loss on tumor growth using the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) xenograft model.  Results:   We provide both genetic and pharmacological evidence to demonstrate that inhibition of PIM expression or activity increases phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr172 in both PC3 and MCF7 cells, but not in their derivatives lacking LKB1. This is explained by our observation that all three PIM family kinases can phosphorylate LKB1 at Ser334. Wild-type LKB1, but not its phosphodeficient derivative, can restore PIM inhibitor-induced AMPK phosphorylation in LKB1 knock-out cells. In the CAM model, loss of LKB1 enhances tumorigenicity of PC3 xenografts, while cells lacking both LKB1 and PIMs exhibit slower proliferation rates and form smaller tumors.  Conclusion:   PIM kinases are novel negative regulators of LKB1 that affect AMPK activity in an LKB1-dependent fashion. The impairment of cell proliferation and tumor growth in cells lacking both LKB1 and PIMs indicates that these kinases possess a shared signaling role in the context of cancer. These data also suggest that PIM inhibitors may be a rational therapeutic option for LKB1-deficient tumors.

Clinical applicability remains challenging wherever manual measurements of numerous suspected lesions are required. Deep learning methods are promising for automated image analysis, typically requiring extensive expert-annotated image datasets to reach sufficient accuracy. We developed a deep learning method to support image-based staging, investigating the use of training information from two radiotracers.  Methods:   In 173 subjects imaged with 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, divided into development (121) and test (52) sets, we trained and evaluated a convolutional neural network to both classify sites of elevated tracer uptake as nonsuspicious or suspicious for cancer and assign them an anatomical location. We evaluated training strategies to leverage information from a larger dataset of 18F-FDG PET/CT images and expert annotations, including transfer learning and combined training encoding the tracer type as input to the network. We assessed the agreement between the N and M stage assigned based on the network annotations and expert annotations, according to the PROMISE miTNM framework.  Results:   In the development set, including 18F-FDG training data improved classification performance in four-fold cross validation. In the test set, compared to expert assessment, training with 18F-FDG data and the development set yielded 80.4% average precision [confidence interval (CI): 71.1-87.8] for identification of suspicious uptake sites, 77% (CI: 70.0-83.4) accuracy for anatomical location classification of suspicious findings, 81% agreement for identification of regional lymph node involvement, and 77% agreement for identification of metastatic stage.

The prostate is localized via implanted fiducial markers before each fraction is delivered using portal-imaging. However, the pelvic lymph nodes are affixed to the bony anatomy and are not mobile in concert with the prostate. The aim of this study was to determine whether a significant difference in pelvic lymph node coverage exists between planned and delivered external beam therapy treatments for these patients.  Methods:   The recorded prostate motions were gathered for 19 patients; conjointly the pelvic lymph node motions were determined by manual registration of the bony anatomy in the kV-images. The difference between the prostate and the bony anatomy coordinates was input into Eclipse as field shifts to represent the deviation in planned vs delivered pelvic lymph node coverage.  Results:   Structure volume at V(100) was recorded for each patient for two structures: summed pelvic lymph nodes (LN CTV) and pelvic lymph nodes +1 cm margin (LN PTV) to express their contribution to the PTV. For the LN PTV, the average difference between the planned coverage and calculated delivered coverage was 3.5%, with a paired t-test value of P = 0.005. Based upon bony anatomy registration, 26% of patients received less than 95% dose coverage using V(100) criteria for LN PTV. Dose value differences between the two plans at minimum were 6.96 ± 6.23 Gy, at mean were 0.54 ± 0.40 Gy, and at maximum were 0.10 ± 0.29 Gy. For the LN CTV, the average difference between the planned coverage and calculated delivered coverage was 1%, with a paired t-test value of P = 0.53.  Conclusions:   The results indicate a significant difference exists between the planned coverage and calculated delivered coverage for the LN PTV. There was no significant difference found for the LN CTV.

Transfecting of miR-622 mimic and inhibitor, negative control (NC) inhibitor and NC was established using Lipofectamine 2000. The mRNA levels of miR-622 and metastatic genes were evaluated using the qRT-PCR and Western blot. Cytotoxic effects of miR-622 were assessed by MTT. Apoptosis was detected using an ELISA cell death assay kit. miR-622 is down-regulated in PC3 cells. As expected, cell viability effects after transfection were described as miR-622 inhibitor >NC and NC inhibitor >miR-622 mimic (p < .01). Importantly, we showed that transfected miR-622 mimic could enhance the apoptosis of PC3 cells, while transfected miR-622 inhibitor could decrease cell apoptosis (p < .01). Furthermore, miR-622 overexpression could increase significantly down-regulated the MMP2, MMP9, CXCR-4, c-Myc and K-Ras expression levels.

Methods:   This study included 162 patients (67 females and 95 males) who received 18F-OC positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT), 128 of whom were diagnosed with neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs). The SUVmax and SUVmean of 18F-OC were measured in 21 normal anatomical structures. We compared the differences among G1, G2, and G3 NENs, as well as between NENs and benign lesions.  Results:   High physiological uptake of 18F-OC (SUVmax > 6.77) was detected in the spleen, adrenal gland, renal parenchyma, pituitary gland, and liver. Moderate uptake (SUVmax 3.00-6.77) was found in the uncinate process of the pancreas (PU), prostate, thyroid, and uterus. Mild uptake (SUVmax 1.34-3.00) was observed in the small intestine, pancreas (pancreas uptake except for the head of the pancreas), gallbladder, and transverse colon. The SUVmax of NENs was higher than that of benign lesions, including fractures, inflamed tissue, reactive hyperplasia, and degenerative disease. However, overlap was noted between the two groups. The SUVmax of 18F-OC uptake by tumors was significantly correlated with tumor grade in primary lesions and those of the lymph node, bone, and other sites (all P < 0.01).  Conclusions:   The results obtained from the majority of the samples in this study show the biodistribution of 18F-OC in normal organs and have significance as a reference. Although some benign lesions show variable uptake, the uptake by these lesions is still different from that of NENs.

However, the only distinction in EPE is whether it is focal or non-focal, causing diagnostic and prognostic ambiguity. We substaged pT3a malignancies using classification of EPE to improve personalized prognostication. We evaluated 465 radical prostatectomy specimens with a digital image analyzer by measuring the number, radial distance and two-dimensional square area of the EPE. The most significant cut-off value was proposed as an algorithm for the pT3a substaging system to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR). A combination of the radial distance and the number of EPEs predicted BCR the most effectively. The optimal cut-off criteria were 0.75 mm and 2 mm in radial distance and multifocal EPE (hazard ratio: 2.526, C-index 0.656). The pT3a was subdivided into pT3a1, < 0.75 mm and any number of EPEs; pT3a2, 0.75-2 mm and one EPE; and pT3a3, > 2 mm and any number of EPEs or 0.75-2 mm and ≥ 2 EPEs.

However, its role in disease progression is still unclear. In this study, we uncover an important mechanism promoting ERG oncogenic activity. We show that ERG is methylated by Enhancer of zest homolog 2 (EZH2) at a specific lysine residue (K362) located within the internal auto-inhibitory domain. Mechanistically, K362 methylation modifies intra-domain interactions, favors DNA binding and enhances ERG transcriptional activity. In a genetically engineered mouse model of ERG fusion-positive prostate cancer (Pb-Cre4 Pten flox/flox Rosa26-ERG, ERG/PTEN), ERG K362 methylation is associated with PTEN loss and progression to invasive adenocarcinomas. In both ERG positive VCaP cells and ERG/PTEN mice, PTEN loss results in AKT activation and EZH2 phosphorylation at serine 21 that favors ERG methylation. We find that ERG and EZH2 interact and co-occupy several sites in the genome forming trans-activating complexes. Consistently, ERG/EZH2 co-regulated target genes are deregulated preferentially in tumors with concomitant ERG gain and PTEN loss and in castration-resistant prostate cancers.

Radical prostatectomy (RP) is the standard of care in the management of clinically localized cancer, but is considered complicated due to the presence of adhesions, and the location of transplanted ureter/kidney. To date, a few case series or studies on RP in RTR have been published, especially in Asian patients. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety and report the experience with RP on RTR.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed data of 1270 patients who underwent RP from January 2008 to March 2020, of which 5 patients were RTR. All available baseline characteristics, perioperative and postoperative data (operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL), complications, length of hospital stay, complication), pathological stage, Gleason score, surgical margin status, and pre/postoperative creatinine were reviewed.  Results:   Of the 5 RTR who underwent RPs (1 open radical prostatectomy (ORP), 1 laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP), 2 robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomies (RALRP), and 1 Retzius-sparing RALRP (RS-RALRP)) prostatectomy, the mean age (± SD) was 70 (± 5.62) years. In LRP and RALRP cases, the standard ports were moved slightly medially to prevent graft injury. The mean operative time ranged from 190 to 365 min. The longest operative time and highest EBL (630 ml) was the ORP case due to severe adhesion in Retzius space. For LRP and RALRP cases, the operative times seemed comparable and had EBL of ≤ 300 ml. All RPs were successful without any major intra-operative complication. There was no significant change in graft function. The restorations of urinary continence were within 1 month in RS-RALRP, approximately 6 months in RALRP, and about 1 year in ORP and LRP. Three patients with positive surgical margins had prostate-specific antigen (PSA) persistence at the first follow-up and 1 had later PSA recurrence. Two patients with negative margins were free from biochemical recurrence at 47 and 3 months after their RP.

Piperlongumine (PL) is a novel potential anticancer agent that has been demonstrated to exhibit anticancer efficacy against prostate cancer cells. However, the effects of PL on DNA damage and repair against CRPC have remained unclear. The aim of this study was to further explore the anticancer activity and mechanisms of action of PL against CRPC in terms of DNA damage and repair processes.  Methods:   The effect of PL on CRPC was evaluated by MTT assay, long-term cell proliferation, reactive oxygen species assay, western blot assay, flow cytometry assay (annexin V/PI staining), β-gal staining assay and DAPI staining assay. The capacity of PL to inhibit the invasion and migration of CRPC cells was assessed by scratch-wound assay, cell adhesion assay, transwell assay and immunofluorescence (IF) assay. The effect of PL on DNA damage and repair was determined via IF assay and comet assay.  Results:   The results showed that PL exhibited stronger anticancer activity against CRPC compared to that of taxol, cisplatin (DDP), doxorubicin (Dox), or 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), with fewer side effects in normal cells. Importantly, PL treatment significantly decreased cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix and inhibited the migration of CRPC cells through affecting the expression and distribution of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), leading to concentration-dependent inhibition of CRPC cell proliferation and concomitantly increased cell death. Moreover, PL treatment triggered persistent DNA damage and provoked strong DNA damage responses in CRPC cells.  Conclusion:   Collectively, our findings demonstrate that PL potently inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRPC cells and that these potent anticancer effects were potentially achieved via triggering persistent DNA damage in CRPC cells.""","""['Ding-Fang Zhang#', 'Zhi-Chun Yang#', 'Jian-Qiang Chen#', 'Xiang-Xiang Jin', 'Yin-da Qiu', 'Xiao-Jing Chen', 'Hong-Yi Shi', 'Zhi-Guo Liu', 'Min-Shan Wang', 'Guang Liang', 'Xiao-Hui Zheng']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BMC Complement Med Ther""","""['Chalcone Derivatives Suppress Proliferation and Migration of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Cells Through FAK-mediated DNA Damage.', 'Rooibos suppresses proliferation of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells via inhibition of Akt signaling.', 'The discovery of novel sanjuanolide derivatives as chemotherapeutic agents targeting castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Assessment of anticancer-treatment outcome in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer-going beyond PSA and imaging, a systematic literature review.', 'A review of treatments targeting DNA-repair gene defects in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Targeting the Interplay of Autophagy and ROS for Cancer Therapy: An Updated Overview on Phytochemicals.', 'Natural Products/Bioactive Compounds as a Source of Anticancer Drugs.', 'Role of Plant-Derived Active Constituents in Cancer Treatment and Their Mechanisms of Action.']"""

Methods:   A. officinarum aqueous and hydroalcoholic extracts were analyzed by using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) for the quantification of three flavonoid compounds. Then, MCF-7, LNCaP, and fibroblast cells were treated with several concentrations (25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 μg/mL) of extracts (24, 48 and 72h). Cell viability was assessed using an MTT assay. Flow cytometry was conducted to evaluate apoptosis.  Results:   Galangin and kaempferol (3.85 and 1.57 mg/g dry extract) were quantified, respectively, in hydroalcoholic and aqueous extracts using a validated method. The hydroalcoholic extract significantly decreased the viability of MCF-7 (IC50: 43.45μg/mL for 48h) and LNCaP cells (IC50: 168 μg/mL for 48h). The aqueous extract reduced cancer cell viability by more than 50% only at 200 and 400 μg/mL (72 h). Treatment of primary fibroblasts with both extracts showed no significant decrease in cell viability (25-100 μg/mL; 24 and 48h). The hydroalcoholic extract induced a significant increase in apoptotic cells in both MCF-7 and LNCaP cells.

Functional enrichment, protein-protein interaction networks, and survival analysis of DEGs were performed. DEGs with a prognostic value considered as candidate genes were evaluated, followed by genetic analysis of tumor infiltrating immune cells based on Wilcoxon test and immunofluorescence identification. Expression profiles analysis showed that 381 overlapping genes were screened as differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which 16 DEGs were randomly selected to be validated and revealed that most of these genes showed a transcriptional profile similar to that seen in the datasets (Pearson's r = 0.76). Six core genes were found to be involved in regulation of extracellular matrix receptor interaction and chemotactic activity, and four of them were significantly correlated with the survival of PCa patients with bone metastases. Immune infiltration analysis showed that the expressions levels of COL3A1, RAC1, FN1, and SDC2 in CD4+T cells were significantly higher than those in tumor cells, especially regulatory T cell infiltration was significantly increased in BM tumors.

Direct determination of the stopping-power ratio (SPR) from dual-energy CT (DECT) has been proposed (DirectSPR), and initial validation studies in phantoms and biological tissues have proven a high accuracy. However, a thorough validation of range prediction in patients has not yet been achieved by any means. Here, we present the first systematic validation of CT-based proton range prediction in patients using prompt gamma imaging (PGI).  Methods and materials:   A PGI slit camera system with improved positioning accuracy, using a floor-based docking station, was used. Its overall uncertainty for range prediction validation was determined experimentally with both x-ray and beam measurements. The accuracy of range prediction in patients was determined from clinical PGI measurements during hypofractionated treatment of 5 patients with prostate cancer - in total 30 fractions with in-room control-CTs. For each pencil-beam-scanning spot, the range shift was obtained by comparing the PGI measurement to a control-CT-based PGI simulation. Three different SPR prediction approaches were applied in simulations: a standard CT-number-to-SPR conversion (Hounsfield look-up table [HLUT]), an adapted HLUT (DECT optimized), and DirectSPR. The spot-wise weighted mean range shift from all spots served as a measure for the accuracy of the respective range prediction approach.  Results:   A mean range prediction accuracy of 0.0% ± 0.5%, 0.3% ± 0.4%, and 1.8% ± 0.4% was obtained for DirectSPR, adapted HLUT, and standard HLUT, respectively. The overall validation uncertainty of the second-generation PGI slit camera is about 1 mm (2σ) for all approaches, which is smaller than the range prediction uncertainty for deep-seated tumors.  Conclusions:   For the first time, range prediction accuracy was assessed in clinical routine using PGI range verification in prostate cancer treatments. Both DECT-derived range prediction approaches agree well with the measured proton range from PGI verification, whereas the standard HLUT approach differs relevantly. These results endorse the recent reduction of clinical safety margins in DirectSPR-based treatment planning in our institution.""","""['Jonathan Berthold', 'Chirasak Khamfongkhruea', 'Johannes Petzoldt', 'Julia Thiele', 'Tobias Hölscher', 'Patrick Wohlfahrt', 'Nils Peters', 'Angelina Jost', 'Christian Hofmann', 'Guillaume Janssens', 'Julien Smeets', 'Christian Richter']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Refinement of the Hounsfield look-up table by retrospective application of patient-specific direct proton stopping-power prediction from dual-energy CT.', 'Reduction of clinical safety margins in proton therapy enabled by the clinical implementation of dual-energy CT for direct stopping-power prediction.', 'Classification of the source of treatment deviation in proton therapy using prompt-gamma imaging information.', 'Dual-Energy Computed Tomography to Assess Intra- and Inter-Patient Tissue Variability for Proton Treatment Planning of Patients With Brain Tumor.', 'Dual- and multi-energy CT for particle stopping-power estimation: current state, challenges and potential.', 'Potential margin reduction in prostate cancer proton therapy with prompt gamma imaging for online treatment verification.', 'Emerging technologies for cancer therapy using accelerated particles.', 'A hybrid multi-particle approach to range assessment-based treatment verification in particle therapy.', 'Image-Guided Proton Therapy: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Experience and new prospects of PET imaging for ion beam therapy monitoring.']"""

Objective:   To estimate the association between administration of IL-6 antagonists compared with usual care or placebo and 28-day all-cause mortality and other outcomes.  Data sources:   Trials were identified through systematic searches of electronic databases between October 2020 and January 2021. Searches were not restricted by trial status or language. Additional trials were identified through contact with experts.  Study selection:   Eligible trials randomly assigned patients hospitalized for COVID-19 to a group in whom IL-6 antagonists were administered and to a group in whom neither IL-6 antagonists nor any other immunomodulators except corticosteroids were administered. Among 72 potentially eligible trials, 27 (37.5%) met study selection criteria.  Data extraction and synthesis:   In this prospective meta-analysis, risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Inconsistency among trial results was assessed using the I2 statistic. The primary analysis was an inverse variance-weighted fixed-effects meta-analysis of odds ratios (ORs) for 28-day all-cause mortality.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality at 28 days after randomization. There were 9 secondary outcomes including progression to invasive mechanical ventilation or death and risk of secondary infection by 28 days.  Results:   A total of 10 930 patients (median age, 61 years [range of medians, 52-68 years]; 3560 [33%] were women) participating in 27 trials were included. By 28 days, there were 1407 deaths among 6449 patients randomized to IL-6 antagonists and 1158 deaths among 4481 patients randomized to usual care or placebo (summary OR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.79-0.95]; P = .003 based on a fixed-effects meta-analysis). This corresponds to an absolute mortality risk of 22% for IL-6 antagonists compared with an assumed mortality risk of 25% for usual care or placebo. The corresponding summary ORs were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.74-0.92; P < .001) for tocilizumab and 1.08 (95% CI, 0.86-1.36; P = .52) for sarilumab. The summary ORs for the association with mortality compared with usual care or placebo in those receiving corticosteroids were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.68-0.87) for tocilizumab and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.61-1.38) for sarilumab. The ORs for the association with progression to invasive mechanical ventilation or death, compared with usual care or placebo, were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.70-0.85) for all IL-6 antagonists, 0.74 (95% CI, 0.66-0.82) for tocilizumab, and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.74-1.34) for sarilumab. Secondary infections by 28 days occurred in 21.9% of patients treated with IL-6 antagonists vs 17.6% of patients treated with usual care or placebo (OR accounting for trial sample sizes, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.85-1.16).

Materials and methods:   Between November 2014 and December 2019, ET was measured in 617 consecutive patients not under androgen deprivation therapy who underwent RP and ePLND. Lymphnode invasion (LNI) was codified as not present (N = 0) or with one (N = 1) or more than one metastatic node (N > 1). The risk of multiple pelvic lymph node metastasis (N > 1, mPLNM) was assessed by comparing it to the other two groups (N > 1 vs. N = 0 and N > 1 vs. N = 1). Then, we assessed the association between ET and lymphnode invasion for standard predictors, such as PSA, percentage of biopsy positive cores (BPC), tumor stage greater than 1 (cT > 1) and tumor grade group greater than two (ISUP > 2).  Results:   Overall, LNI was detected in 70 patients (11.3%) of whom 39 (6.3%) with N = 1 and 31 (5%) with N > 1.

Conclusions:   In clinical PCa, the risk of mPLNM was increased by low ET levels. As ET decreased, patients had an increased likelihood of mPLNM.

MRI provides excellent soft tissue visualisation but does not provide any electron density information required for radiotherapy dose calculation, instead MRI is registered to CT images to enable dose calculations. MRI-only radiotherapy eliminates registration errors and reduces patient discomfort, workload and cost. Electron density requirements may be addressed in different ways, from manually applying bulk density corrections, to more computationally intensive methods to produce substitute CT datasets (sCT), requiring additional sequences, increasing overall imaging time. Reducing MR imaging time would reduce potential artefacts from intrafraction motion and patient discomfort. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of reducing MR imaging time on a hybrid atlas-voxel sCT conversion for prostate MRI-only treatment planning, considering both anatomical and dosimetric parameters. 10 volunteers were scanned on a Siemens Skyra 3T MRI. Sequences included the 3D T2-weighted (T2-w) SPACE sequence used for sCT conversion as previously validated against CT, along with variations to this sequence in repetition time (TR), turbo factor, and combinations of these to reduce the imaging time. All scans were converted to sCT and were compared to the sCT from the original SPACE sequence, evaluating for anatomical changes and dosimetric differences for a standard prostate VMAT plan. Compared to the previously validated T2-w SPACE sequence, scan times were reduced by up to 80%.

The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) dataset is an aggregation of worldwide registries and health data systems that reports global and regional assessment of disease impact.  Methods:   Using the GBD database, 1171 worldwide registries and health registration systems from 1990 to 2016 were aggregated for prostate cancer disease codes and outcomes. Disease-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) were calculated and segregated by sociodemographic index (SDI) quintile, and compared to other urologic diseases and tuberculosis (TB).  Results:   Prostate cancer exerts a burden of disease that is vastly higher in the top quintile of SDI. The three lowest SDI quintiles represent the majority of global population but are currently less impacted by prostate cancer. Conversely, TB has its highest impact on the lowest SDI levels, although these rates are declining.  Conclusions:   As a global disease, prostate cancer predominantly affects high SDI men who enjoy a longer life expectancy in which to suffer from this disease and a greater exposure to screening and diagnosis. As lower SDI men are elevated in health and income, reallocation of DALYs will occur, and a greater burden of prostate cancer can be expected.

The role of BMI on survival outcomes was investigated both as a continuous and categorical variable (≤24.9 vs. 25-29.9 vs. ≥30 km/m2). BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 was considered obese. Analyses were adjusted for age, PSA, ECOG performance status, number of metastases and prior treatment. The Cox semi-proportional hazard model was used to predict OS, whereas competing risks regression was used for predicting cancer-specific mortality (CSM). To exclude any possible effect attributable to higher doses of chemotherapy (titrated according to body-surface area), we checked for eventual interactions between BMI and chemotherapy dose (both as continuous-continuous and categorical-continuous interactions).  Results:   The median (IQR) age for the patient population was 69 (63,74) years with a median (IQR) BMI of 28 (25-31) kg/m2. Median follow-up for survivors was 12 months.

Methods and materials:   In total, 459 patients who underwent multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) before prostate biopsy were included. Radiomic features were extracted from both T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Patients were divided into different training sets and testing sets for different targets according to a ratio of 7:3. Radiomics signatures were built using radiomic features on the training set, and integrated models were built by adding clinical characteristics. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were calculated to assess the classification performance on the testing sets.  Results:   The radiomics signatures for benign and malignant lesion discrimination achieved AUCs of 0.775 (T2WI), 0.863 (ADC) and 0.855 (ADC + T2WI). The corresponding integrated models improved the AUC to 0.851/0.912/0.905, respectively. The radiomics signatures for ECE achieved the highest AUC of 0.625 (ADC), and the corresponding integrated model achieved the highest AUC (0.728). The radiomics signatures for PSM prediction achieved AUCs of 0.614 (T2WI) and 0.733 (ADC). The corresponding integrated models reached AUCs of 0.680 and 0.766, respectively.  Conclusions:   The MRI-based radiomics models, which took advantage of radiomic features on ADC and T2WI scans, showed good performance in discriminating benign and malignant prostate lesions and predicting ECE and PSM. Combining radiomics signatures and clinical factors enhanced the performance of the models, which may contribute to clinical diagnosis and treatment.""","""['Dong He#', 'Ximing Wang#', 'Chenchao Fu', 'Xuedong Wei', 'Jie Bao', 'Xuefu Ji', 'Honglin Bai', 'Wei Xia', 'Xin Gao', 'Yuhua Huang', 'Jianquan Hou']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Imaging""","""['Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Based Peritumoral Radiomics for Preoperative Prediction of the Presence of Extracapsular Extension With Prostate Cancer.', 'Bi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging based radiomics for the identification of benign and malignant prostate lesions: cross-vendor validation.', 'A dynamic-static combination model based on radiomics features for prostate cancer using multiparametric MRI.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'The role of radiomics in prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Radiomics‑Clinical model based on 99mTc-MDP SPECT/CT for distinguishing between bone metastasis and benign bone disease in tumor patients.', 'Multi-view radiomics and deep learning modeling for prostate cancer detection based on multi-parametric MRI.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based Prostate Specific Antigen Density and PI-RADSv2 score help identify Apical Prostate Cancer.', 'Ki67 and the apparent diffusion coefficient in postoperative prostate cancer with endocrine therapy.', 'The Use of MRI-Derived Radiomic Models in Prostate Cancer Risk Stratification: A Critical Review of Contemporary Literature.']"""

SARS-CoV-2 entry into lung epithelium requires the TMPRSS2 cell surface protease. Pre-clinical and correlative data in humans suggest that anti-androgenic therapies can reduce the expression of TMPRSS2 on lung epithelium. Accordingly, we hypothesize that therapeutic targeting of androgen receptor signaling via degarelix, a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) antagonist, will suppress COVID-19 infection and ameliorate symptom severity.  Methods:   This is a randomized phase 2, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial in 198 patients to compare efficacy of degarelix plus best supportive care versus placebo plus best supportive care on improving the clinical outcomes of male Veterans who have been hospitalized due to COVID-19. Enrolled patients must have documented infection with SARS-CoV-2 based on a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction result performed on a nasopharyngeal swab and have a severity of illness of level 3-5 (hospitalized but not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation). Patients stratified by age, history of hypertension, and severity are centrally randomized 2:1 (degarelix: placebo). The composite primary endpoint is mortality, ongoing need for hospitalization, or requirement for mechanical ventilation at 15 after randomization. Important secondary endpoints include time to clinical improvement, inpatient mortality, length of hospitalization, duration of mechanical ventilation, time to achieve a normal temperature, and the maximum severity of COVID-19 illness. Exploratory analyses aim to assess the association of cytokines, viral load, and various comorbidities with outcome. In addition, TMPRSS2 expression in target tissue and development of anti-viral antibodies will also be investigated.  Discussion:   In this trial, we repurpose the FDA approved LHRH antagonist degarelix, commonly used for prostate cancer, to suppress TMPRSS2, a host cell surface protease required for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. The objective is to determine if temporary androgen suppression with a single dose of degarelix improves the clinical outcomes of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19.

It can also affect the growth, migration, and invasion of tumors. The abnormal expression of lncRNA is associated with malignant tumors. In addition, it has been proved that lncRNA is a key targeted gene for the treatment of some diseases. PART1, a member of lncRNA, has been reported as a regulator in the process of tumor occurrence and development. This study aims to reveal the biological functions, specific mechanisms, and clinical significance of PART1 in various tumor cells.  Methods:   Through the careful search of PUBMED, the mechanisms of the effect of PART1 on tumorigenesis and development are summarized.  Results:   On the one hand, the up-regulated expression of PART1 plays a tumor-promoting role in tumors, including lung cancer, prostate cancer, bladder cancer, and so on. On the other hand, PART1 is down-regulated in gastric cancer, glioma, and other tumors to play a tumor inhibitory role. In addition, PART1 regulates tumor growth mainly by targeting microRNA, such as miR-635, directly regulating the expression of proteins, such as FUS/EZH2, affecting signal pathways, such as Toll-like receptor pathway, or regulating immune cells.  Conclusion:   PART1 is closely related to tumors by regulating a variety of molecular mechanisms. In addition, PART1 can be used as a clinical marker for the early diagnosis of tumors and plays an important role in tumortargeted therapy.""","""['Jinlan Chen', 'Enqing Meng', 'Yexiang Lin', 'Yujie Shen', 'Chengyu Hu', 'Gang Zhou', 'Chengfu Yuan']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Curr Pharm Des""","""['Long non-coding RNA PART1 predicts a poor prognosis and promotes the malignant progression of pancreatic cancer by sponging miR-122.', 'LncRNA PART1 inhibits glioma proliferation and migration via miR-374b/SALL1 axis.', 'Long noncoding RNA PART1 restrains aggressive gastric cancer through the epigenetic silencing of PDGFB via the PLZF-mediated recruitment of EZH2.', 'AGAP2-AS1: An Indispensable lncRNA in Tumors.', 'Long non‑coding RNA PART1: dual role in cancer.']"""

Moreover, missing values among patients add another layer of difficulty in precisely inferring their outcomes. In light of these issues, we propose a data-driven, deep learning-based imputation and inference framework (DIIF). DIIF seamlessly encapsulates two modules: an imputation module driven by a regularized deep autoencoder for imputing critical missing information and an inference module in which two deep variational autoencoders are coupled with a graphical inference model to quantify the personalized and race-specific causal effects. Large-scale empirical studies on the independent sub-cohorts of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) PCa patients demonstrate the effectiveness of DIIF. We further found that somatic mutations in TP53, ATM, PTEN, FOXA1, and PIK3CA are statistically significant genomic factors that may explain the racial disparities in different PCa features characterized by PSA.""","""['Zhong Chen', 'Bo Cao', 'Andrea Edwards', 'Hongwen Deng', 'Kun Zhang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Bioinform Comput Biol""","""['Inferring Personalized and Race-Specific Causal Effects of Genomic Aberrations on Gleason Scores: A Deep Latent Variable Model.', 'Genomic Profiling of Prostate Cancers from Men with African and European Ancestry.', 'Genetically adjusted prostate-specific antigen values may prevent delayed biopsies in African-American men.', 'Molecular basis for prostate cancer racial disparities.', 'Prostate Cancer Genomics: Recent Advances and the Prevailing Underrepresentation from Racial and Ethnic Minorities.', 'The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Health Equity in Oncology: Scoping Review.']"""

Method:   Using the French National Health Insurance System database, all patients newly exposed to abiraterone or enzalutamide between 2013 and 2017 and followed until 31 December 2018 were targeted. IRRs for each event were estimated using a Poisson model in a sub-population of patients without contraindications or precautions for use for either treatment.  Results:   Among 11 534 new users of abiraterone and enzalutamide, AKI (IRR 1.42, 95% CI: 1.01-2.00), liver monitoring suggestive of hepatic damage (IRR 3.06, 95% CI: 2.66-3.53) and atrial fibrillation (IRR 1.12, 95% CI: 1.05-1.19) were significantly more often observed with abiraterone than with enzalutamide.

The mean duration of follow-up and duration until the diagnosis of BCR was calculated as 35.2 ± 16.7 and 11.5 ± 11.3 months, respectively. The multivariate analysis revealed that NLR, PSAd, risk classification, PIRADS score, T stage, presence or absence of positive surgical margin, and seminal vesicle invasion were predictive for BCR. Classic Cox regression analysis had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.915 with a sensitivity and specificity of 90.6% and 79.8%. The AUCs for receiver-operating characteristic curves for random forest, K nearest neighbour, and logistic regression were 0.95, 0.93, and 0.93, respectively. All ML models outperformed the conventional statistical regression model in the prediction of BCR after prostatectomy.  Conclusion:   The construction of more reliable and potent models will provide the clinicians and patients with advantages such as more accurate risk classification, prognosis estimation, early intervention, avoidance of unnecessary treatments, relatively lower morbidity and mortality. The ML methods are cheap, and their powers increase with increasing data input; we believe that their clinical use will increase over time.""","""['Mithat Ekşi', 'İsmail Evren', 'Fatih Akkaş', 'Yusuf Arıkan', 'Osman Özdemir', 'Deniz N Özlü', 'Ali Ayten', 'Selcuk Sahin', 'Volkan Tuğcu', 'Ali I Taşçı']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Use of machine learning to predict early biochemical recurrence after robot-assisted prostatectomy.', 'Incorporating artificial intelligence in urology: Supervised machine learning algorithms demonstrate comparative advantage over nomograms in predicting biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy.', 'Predictive factors and oncological outcomes of persistently elevated prostate-specific antigen in patients following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Superior Biochemical Recurrence and Long-term Quality-of-life Outcomes Are Achievable with Robotic Radical Prostatectomy After a Long Learning Curve-Updated Analysis of a Prospective Single-surgeon Cohort of 2206 Consecutive Cases.', 'The impact of single positive surgical margin features on biochemical recurrence after robotic radical prostatectomy.', 'Machine-learning predicts time-series prognosis factors in metastatic prostate cancer patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy.']"""

PROST is designed to minimize human error by introducing some autonomy in the execution of the key steps of the procedure, i.e., target selection, image fusion and needle positioning. The robot allows executing a targeted biopsy through ultrasound (US) guidance and fusion with magnetic resonance (MR) images, where the target was defined.  Methods:   PROST is a parallel robot with 4 degrees of freedom (DOF) to orient the needle and 1 DOF to rotate the US probe. We reached a calibration error of less than 2 mm, computed as the difference between the needle positioning in robot coordinates and in the US image. The autonomy of the robot is given by the image analysis software, which employs deep learning techniques, the integrated image fusion algorithms and automatic computation of the needle trajectory. For safety reasons, the insertion of the needle is assigned to the doctor.  Results:   System performance was evaluated in terms of positioning accuracy. Tests were performed on a 3D printed object with nine 2-mm spherical targets and on an anatomical commercial phantom that simulates human prostate with three lesions and the surrounding structures. The average accuracy reached in the laboratory experiments was [Formula: see text] in the first test and [Formula: see text] in the second test.  Conclusions:   We introduced a first prototype of a prostate biopsy robot that has the potential to increase the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer and, by including some level of autonomy, to simplify the procedure, to reduce human errors and shorten training time. The use of a robot for the biopsy of the prostate will create the possibility to include also a treatment, such as focal ablation, to be delivered through the same system.""","""['Bogdan Maris', 'Chiara Tenga', 'Rudy Vicario', 'Luigi Palladino', 'Noe Murr', 'Michela De Piccoli', 'Andrea Calanca', 'Stefano Puliatti', 'Salvatore Micali', 'Alessandro Tafuri', 'Paolo Fiorini']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg""","""['Magnetic resonance imaging-targeted, 3D transrectal ultrasound-guided fusion biopsy for prostate cancer: Quantifying the impact of needle delivery error on diagnosis.', 'Accuracy study of a robotic system for MRI-guided prostate needle placement.', 'Evaluation of robot-assisted MRI-guided prostate biopsy: needle path analysis during clinical trials.', 'Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Ultrasound Fusion Targeted Biopsy: A Systematic Review.', 'Targeted prostate biopsy and MR-guided therapy for prostate cancer.']"""

Purpose:   To evaluate image quality and ability to detect PCa with quantitative T2-mapping and DWI in men with hip prosthesis undergoing prostate MRI.  Study type:   Prospective, cross-sectional study.  Population:   Thirty consecutive men with hip replacement (18 unilateral, 12 bilateral) undergoing prostate MRI from 2019 to 2021.  Field strength/sequence:   3-T; multiparametric MRI (T2W, DCE-MRI, echo-planar [EPI]-DWI), T2-mapping (Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill), FOCUS-EPI-DWI, PROPELLER-DWI.  Assessment:   Five blinded radiologists independently evaluated MRI image quality using a 5-point Likert scale. PI-RADS v2.1 scores were applied in four interpretation strategies: 1) T2W-FSE+DCE-MRI+EPI-DWI, 2) T2W-FSE+DCE-MRI+EPI-DWI+FOCUS-EPI-DWI, 3) T2W-FSE+DCE-MRI+EPI-DWI+PROPELLER-DWI, 4) T2W-FSE+DCE-MRI+EPI-DWI+T2-maps. Five-point confidence scores were recorded.  Statistical analysis:   ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis with pair-wise comparisons by Wilcoxon sign-rank, and paired t-tests, P < 0.05 was considered significant. Cohen's Kappa (k) for PI-RADSv2.1 scoring and proportion of correctly classified lesions tabulated for pathology-confirmed cases with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).  Results:   For all radiologists, T2-map image quality was significantly higher than EPI-DWI, FOCUS-EPI-DWI, and PROPELLER-DWI and similar (P = 0.146-0.706) or significantly better (for two readers) than T2W-FSE and DCE-MRI. PI-RADS v2.1 agreement improved comparing strategy A (k = 0.46) to strategy B (k = 0.58) to strategy C (k = 0.58) and was highest with strategy D which included T2-maps (k = 1.00). Radiologists' confidence was significantly highest with strategy D. Strategies B and C had similar confidence (P = 0.051-0.063) both significantly outperforming strategy A. Twelve men with 17 lesions had pathology confirmed diagnoses (13 PCa, 4 benign). Strategy D had the highest proportion of correctly classified lesions (76.5-82.4%) with overlapping 95% confidence intervals.  Data conclusion:   T2-mapping may be a valuable adjunct to prostate MRI in men with hip replacement resulting in improved image quality, higher reader confidence, interobserver agreement, and accuracy in PI-RADS scoring.

For prostate cancer (PC), however, the molecular mechanisms that drive its different immune phenotypes have yet to be fully elucidated. Patient gene expression data were analyzed from The Cancer Genome Atlas-prostate adenocarcinoma (TCGA-PRAD) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) databases. We used a Cell-type Identification by Estimating Relative Subsets of RNA Transcripts (CIBERSORT) analysis and an unsupervised clustering analysis to identify patient subgroups with distinct immune phenotypes. These distinct phenotypes were then explored for associations for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and both epigenetic and genetic landscapes. Finally, we used a protein-protein interaction analysis to identify key hub genes. We identified two patient subgroups with independent immune phenotypes associated with the expression of Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Patient samples in Cluster 1 (C1) had higher scores for immune-cell subsets compared to Cluster 2 (C2), and C2 samples had higher specific somatic mutations, MHC mutations, and genomic copy number variations compared to C1. We also found additional cluster phenotype differences for DNA methylation, microRNA (miRNA) expression, and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) expression. Furthermore, we established a 4-gene model to distinguish between clusters by integrating analyses for DEGs, lncRNAs, miRNAs, and methylation. Notably, we found that glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) might serve as a key hub gene within the genetic and epigenetic regulatory networks. These results improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor immune phenotypes that are associated with tumor immune escape.

This meta-analysis further elucidated this relationship by analyzing the changes in T lymphocyte subsets in different tumors before and after radiotherapy.  Methods:   We searched English-language electronic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library to collect studies on the changes in peripheral blood CD3+ T lymphocytes, CD4+ T lymphocytes, and CD8+ T lymphocytes before and after radiotherapy in tumor patients from January 2015 to April 2021. The quality of the included literature was evaluated using the NOS scale provided by the Cochrane Collaboration, and statistical software RevMan 5.4 was used to analyze the included literature. P<0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.  Results:   A total of 19 studies in 16 articles involving 877 tumor patients were included. All data were collected within 1 month before or after radiotherapy. Meta-analysis showed that numbers of CD3+ T lymphocytes (SMD: -0.40; 95% CI [-0.75, -0.04]; p = 0.03) and CD4+ T lymphocytes (SMD: -0.43; 95% CI: [-0.85, -0.02]; p = 0.04) were significantly reduced after radiotherapy compared with before treatment, but there was no statistically significant difference for CD8+ T lymphocytes (SMD: 0.33; 95% CI: [-0.88, 0.74]; p = 0.12). Subgroup analysis showed that peripheral blood T lymphocytes decreased in head and neck cancer. However, in prostate cancer and breast cancer, there was no significant change in peripheral blood. 1 month after radiotherapy, it has a potential proliferation and activation effect on lymphocytes in esophageal cancer and lung cancer. The results showed that CD8+T lymphocytes increased in peripheral blood after SBRT. Radiotherapy alone reduced CD3+ T lymphocyte numbers.  Conclusions:   Within 1 month of radiotherapy, patients have obvious immunological changes, which can cause apoptosis and reduction of T lymphocytes, and affect the balance of peripheral blood immune cells.

The present study was conducted to evaluate the antitumor potential of PAWR gene induction by these saRNAs in bladder cancer. Promisingly, we found that up-regulation of PAWR by saRNA inhibited the growth of bladder cancer cells by inducing cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest which was related to inhibition of anti‑apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and inactivation of the NF-κB and Akt pathways. The activation of the caspase cascade and the regulation of cell cycle related proteins also supported the efficacy of the treatment. Moreover, our study also showed that these saRNAs cooperated with cisplatin in the inhibition of bladder cancer cells.

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the clinical outcomes of patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (n = 102) and urothelial carcinoma (UC) (n = 101) treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. The duration of SD (DoSD) was calculated for patients who had SD as their best response and was defined from the time of SD to radiologically confirmed progressive disease (PD) or death.  Results:   Fifty-five patients (27.1%) had SD as the initial response. Among them, 10 patients (18.2%) achieved a response on subsequent assessments. With a median follow-up duration of 15.2 months, the median DoSD was 8.5 months (range: 3.2-13.8), which was significantly different according to the disease; 9.4 months in RCC and 2.3 months in UC (p = 0.03). If the disease did not progress in 4 months (long SD subgroup), the DoSD (11.0 months) was comparable to the duration of response (12.9 months) in patients who achieved a complete or partial response to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. In addition to the cancer type, the clinical factors associated with short DoSD were liver metastases (p = 0.003), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) > 4.0 (p = 0.001), and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) > 194 (p = 0.003).

Cancer cells can take up lipids from the microenvironment and store them in lipid droplets (LDs). Fatty acids released from LDs are used by PCa cells as preferential metabolic fuels to provide energy and promote cancer progression. Recently, fatty acids have been associated with autophagy, a cellular recycling pathway. Lipophagy is a selective form of autophagy involved in LD degradation, the role of which in PCa progression remains unknown. Here, we explored markers of autophagy and lipophagy in human PCa tissues in correlation with factors of aggressiveness, and we evaluated the influence of PPAT adipocytes on autophagy and lipophagy. We analyzed markers of autophagy (p62, LC3), lipid droplets (PLIN and Oil Red O), androgen receptor (AR), proliferation (Ki67), and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Zeb1) on 465 PCa samples. Co-cultures of PCa cell lines PC3 and 22RV1 with adipocytes isolated from patients' PPAT were used to analyze the influence of PPAT on autophagy and lipophagy in vitro. In human PCa tissues, we observed a correlation between markers of LD and those of autophagy, which are associated with clinical and biological factors of disease aggressiveness. In addition, PLIN staining was associated with AR expression. In locally advanced PCa, p62, LC3, and PLIN were increased in extraprostatic areas where cancer cells are in contact with PPAT. Co-culture of PCa cell lines with adipocytes decreased autophagy activity and increased LD flux in PC3 cells. These results suggest an active process of lipophagy in PCa, linked to disease aggressiveness, to the proximity of PPAT, and induced in vitro in co-culture with adipocytes. Lipophagy is therefore likely to be a crucial player in PCa progression. © 2021 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Although cabazitaxel improves overall survival when used following docetaxel chemotherapy, duration of the clinical response is relatively short, and few patients achieve a long-term response. CASE REPORT A 71-year-old man with prostate adenocarcinoma with an initial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 4956 ng/ml, Gleason score 4+5 and cTxN0M1b was referred to our department for treatment. Several therapeutic approaches, including androgen deprivation therapy, with a combination of bicalutamide and a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue, and 4 sequential hormonal therapies including flutamide, estramustine, enzalutamide, and abiraterone, all failed to prevent disease progression. Subsequently, after 5 cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy were also ineffective, cabazitaxel chemotherapy at a dose of 20 mg/m² together with prednisone and pegfilgrastim was initiated. The patient developed grade 4 thrombocytopenia during the first 4 cycles, and the dosage of cabazitaxel had to be tapered to 12.5 mg/m² by the fifth cycle. In subsequent cycles, the treatment was continued without grade 4 thrombocytopenia or any other toxicities ³grade 3.

Methods:   Patients who underwent RARP for prostate cancer in our clinic between January 2013 and January 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients' demographic data, preoperative and postoperative parameters were all recorded in the database. NLR was calculated by dividing the absolute neutrophil count (NC) by the absolute lymphocyte count (LC). Patients were classified as low, moderate and high risk according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCNN) Guidelines. Any increase in GS between biopsy results and radical prostatectomy specimens were consideredas an GS upgrading.  Results:   After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 571 patients, 205 patients without GS upgrading (Group 1) and 366 patients with GS upgrading (Group 2), were included. The mean preoperative PSA values and prostate volumes were 10.8 ± 8 ng/dL and 45 ± 18.8 ml, respectively. Group 2 had a significantly high NC and NLR, significantly low platelet count (PC) and LC, (p=0.0001, 0.0001, 0.001 and0.002, respectively). Group 2 was found to have significantly higher positive surgical margin (PSM), extraprostatic extension (EPE) and seminal vesical invasion (SVI) (p<0.001). There was no significant correlation between the parameters of NLR and PSM, EPE, SVI, and lymph node invasion (LNI). Binomial logistic regression showed patients with increased NLR had 1.68 times higher odds to exhibit an upgrade in GS in the post-surgical histopathological analysis.

Method and patients:   The clinical-pathological findings of the prostate biopsy were used to determine the CAPRA score, classifying patients into low, intermediate and high risk. Blood and bone marrow samples to detect circulating prostate cells (CPCs) and micro-metastasis were taken. The samples were classified as positive if ≥1 prostate cell was detected, forming three subgroups; Group A (MRD negative), Group B (micro-metastasis positive, CPC negative) and Group C (CPC positive).

Deep attention mechanisms drive its detection network, targeting salient structures and highly discriminative feature dimensions across multiple resolutions. Its goal is to accurately identify csPCa lesions from indolent cancer and the wide range of benign pathology that can afflict the prostate gland. Simultaneously, a decoupled residual classifier is used to achieve consistent false positive reduction, without sacrificing high sensitivity or computational efficiency. In order to guide model generalization with domain-specific clinical knowledge, a probabilistic anatomical prior is used to encode the spatial prevalence and zonal distinction of csPCa.

Methods: We retrospectively studied 50 patients who were evaluated for 177Lu-PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy and underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT to determine disease status. Their mean age was 67.5 ± 8 y (52-84 y), and their average serum prostate-specific antigen level was 401 ± 1,353 ng/mL (0.098-9,235.13 ng/mL) at the time of scanning. They underwent standard 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT an average of 65 min after injection (60-90 min). Tumors (n = 50) were correlated with miPSMA expression score and uptake. Physiologic tracer distribution was estimated by placing a volume of interest 1 cm in diameter for smaller organs (submandibular, parotid, lacrimal, and tubarial glands; renal cortices; blood pool; and bowel) and 3 cm for larger organs (liver and spleen). SUVmax and SUVmean were estimated for each region. Tumor-to-spleen (T/S), tumor-to-liver (T/L), and tumor-to-parotid (T/P) ratios were calculated for each lesion. For 16 patients who underwent a delayed scan an average of 135 min after injection (120-150 min), additional analysis evaluated the effect of the delay. Results: Uptake was maximal in renal cortices, followed by salivary glands, bowel, spleen, liver, lacrimal glands, and blood pool. SUVmax averaged 37.7 ± 22.1 for renal cortices, 15.4 ± 7.3 for submandibular glands, 14.4 ± 7.1 for parotid glands, 9.4 ± 4.9 for spleen, 6.2 ± 3.7 for lacrimal glands, 5.9 ± 2.3 for liver, 5.3 ± 1.41 for tubarial glands, 13.8 ± 7.6 for bowel, and 2.4 ± 1.9 for blood pool. SUVmax averaged 10.33 ± 3.27 (6.46-17) for miPSMA expression score 2 and 38.21 ± 25.9 (7.68-119.08) for score 3. T/S and T/P ratios averaged 1.21 ± 0.44 (0.48-2.04) and 0.6 ± 0.18 (0.39-0.87), respectively, for score 2 and 5.05 ± 4.46 (1.25-20.89) and 3.15 ± 2.09 (1.06-9.45), respectively, for score 3. SUVmax for score 3 lesions averaged 18.85, which increased significantly to 26.24 on delayed imaging (P = 0.0001). However, T/L, T/S, and T/P ratios did not significantly change. Temporal variation in normal organs showed SUVmax to increase significantly on delayed scans for salivary (submandibular and parotid) and lacrimal glands and renal cortices, whereas SUVmean increased significantly for spleen; liver; and parotid, tubarial, and lacrimal glands and insignificantly for other organs.

Objective:   To prospectively study long-term changes in general, mental, and physical QoL in a contemporary active surveillance (AS) patient cohort with low-risk prostate cancer (PCa).  Design, setting, and participants:   The study population consisted of patients enrolled in the PRIAS trial in Helsinki University Hospital (n = 348). The RAND-36 questionnaire was used to assess general QoL at the start of AS and at 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 years during follow-up. Patients who had undergone robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP; n = 88) also received the questionnaire after treatment.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Changes over time were analysed using multilevel mixed-effects regression models, and reported as the mean and95% confidence interval. A rule of 0.5 × standard deviation was used to estimate changes of clinical importance.  Results and limitations:   Median follow-up until the end of AS or last follow-up was 7.2 (range 0.3-12.7) yr. A decrease was observed in six of eight QoL subdomains at 7 yr. However, all scores were above age-stratified reference values. There was no difference between the group who continued AS throughout the study period and the group who discontinued AS and underwent RALP. More than half of the study cohort discontinued AS (n = 198; 57%), 135 men (68%) because of events specified in the protocol and only seven (3.5%) because of anxiety. Metastatic disease developed in six patients (1.7%), and two cases (0.6%) of PCa-related death were recorded among 348 patients in more than 12 yr of overall follow-up. The lack of a randomised control population is a limitation of the study.  Conclusions:   Contemporary protocolised AS does not impair general QoL. Men undergoing a treatment change (RALP) did not experience a decrease in QoL before or after their treatment change.  Patient summary:   Active surveillance is a safe treatment option for men with low-risk prostate cancer. We show that this follow-up strategy does not cause a decline in patients' general quality of life.""","""['Utku Lokman', 'Hanna Vasarainen', 'Kanerva Lahdensuo', 'Andrew Erickson', 'Timo Muhonen', 'Tuomas Mirtti', 'Antti Rannikko']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Prostate cancer active surveillance and health-related quality of life: results of the Finnish arm of the prospective trial.', 'A Decade of Active Surveillance in the PRIAS Study: An Update and Evaluation of the Criteria Used to Recommend a Switch to Active Treatment.', 'Active monitoring, radical prostatectomy and radical radiotherapy in PSA-detected clinically localised prostate cancer: the ProtecT three-arm RCT.', 'Quality of Life Outcomes after Primary Treatment for Clinically Localised Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'How does active surveillance for prostate cancer affect quality of life?

System specific geometrical errors due to gradient nonlinearity were determined for the MRL. Within the prostate and skin contour,B0inhomogeneity, gradient nonlinearity error and the total geometrical error (vector summation of the prior two) was determined. Image quality was determined by visually scoring the extent of implant-born image artifacts. A treatment planning study was performed on five patients to quantify the impact of the implant on plan quality, in which conventional MRL IMRT plans were created, as well as plans which avoid radiation through the left or right femur.Results.The total maximum geometrical error in the prostate was <1 mm and the skin contour <1.7 mm; in all cases the machine-specific gradient error was most dominant. TheB0error for the MRlinac MRI could partly be predicted based on the pre-treatment 3 T scan. Image quality for all patients was sufficient at 1.5 T MRL. Plan comparison showed that, even with avoidance of the hips, in all cases sufficient target coverage could be obtained with similar D1cc and D5cc to rectum and bladder, while V28Gy was slightly poorer in only the rectum for femur avoidance.Conclusion.We showed that geometrical accuracy, image quality and plan quality for six prostate patients with a hip implant or hip fixation treated on a 1.5 T MRL did not show relevant deterioration for the used image settings, which allowed safe treatment.""","""['A L H M W van Lier', 'L T C Meijers', 'M E P Phillippens', 'J Hes', 'B W Raaymakers', 'J R N van der Voort van Zyp', 'J C J de Boer']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Dosimetric comparison of MR-linac-based IMRT and conventional VMAT treatment plans for prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of geometrical uncertainties on localized prostate radiotherapy of patients with bilateral metallic hip prostheses using 3D-CRT, IMRT and VMAT: A planning study.', 'Comparison of Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy Treatment Plans Between 1.5T MR-Linac and Conventional Linac.', 'MRI-based IMRT planning for MR-linac: comparison between CT- and MRI-based plans for pancreatic and prostate cancers.', 'Primary treatment of prostate cancer using 1.5\xa0T MR-linear accelerator.']"""

Patients and methods:   This retrospective claims data study followed patients with mCRPC receiving cabazitaxel or docetaxel from their first chemotherapy infusion. Haematological toxicities were measured using treatment codes and inpatient diagnoses. OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to identify OS predictors.  Results:   Data from 539 patients administered docetaxel and 240 administered cabazitaxel were analysed. Regarding adverse events, within 8 months of treatment initiation, some kind of treatment for haematological toxicity was documented in 31% of patients given docetaxel and in 61% of patients given cabazitaxel. In the same period, hospitalization associated with haematological toxicity was documented in 11% of the patients in the docetaxel cohort and in 15% of the patients in the cabazitaxel cohort. In the docetaxel cohort, 9.9% of patients required reverse isolation and 13% were diagnosed with sepsis during hospitalization. In the cabazitaxel cohort, the cumulative incidence was 7.9% and 15%, respectively. The median OS was reached at 21.9 months in the docetaxel cohort and, because of a later line of therapy, at 11.3 months in the cabazitaxel cohort. A multivariate Cox regression revealed that indicators of locally advanced and metastatic disease, severe comorbidities, and prior hormonal/cytotoxic therapies were independent predictors of early death.

Here, we investigated whether KH176m (the active metabolite of sonlicromanol), a recently discovered selective mPGES-1 inhibitor, could affect prostate cancer cells-derived spheroid growth. We demonstrated that KH176m suppressed mPGES-1 expression and growth of DU145 (high mPGES-1 expression)-derived spheroids, while it had no effect on the LNCaP cell line, which has low mPGES-1 expression. By addition of exogenous PGE2, we found that the effect of KH176m on mPGES-1 expression and spheroid growth is due to the inhibition of a PGE2-driven positive feedback control-loop of mPGES-1 transcriptional regulation. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subset of cancer cells exhibiting the ability of self-renewal, plasticity, and initiating and maintaining tumor growth. Our data shows that mPGES-1 is specifically expressed in this CSCs subpopulation (CD44+CD24-). KH176m inhibited the expression of mPGES-1 and reduced the growth of spheroids derived from the CSC.

Methods:   We used 2007-2016 SEER-Medicare data to identify patients with breast and prostate cancer receiving chemotherapy, endocrine therapy (breast), or androgen deprivation therapy (prostate). For each hospital, we calculated 6-month expected mortality, emergency department (ED) visits, inpatient admissions, and costs, all commonly collected APM outcomes. After calculating observed-to-expected rates for each outcome by hospital, we estimated the association between observed-to-expected rates and characteristics of each hospital to understand hospital characteristics that might be associated with higher- or lower-than-expected rates of each outcome.  Results:   Hospitals with > 15% rural patients had significantly higher-than-expected mortality (0.31 points higher, P < .001) and ED visit rates (0.10 points higher, P = .029) as well as significantly lower costs (0.06 points lower, P = .004). Hospitals unaffiliated with a medical school also experienced significantly higher-than-expected mortality and ED visits. Hospitals eligible for disproportionate share hospital payment experienced significantly higher ED visits but lower costs. For-profit hospitals experienced higher-than-expected mortality.

CLSPN is an oncogenic gene that contributes to tumor proliferation in several human solid tumors. However, the clinical significance of claspin in prostate cancer (PCa) has not been examined. The present study aimed to elucidate the role of claspin and its relationship with DTX resistance in PCa. We immunohistochemically analyzed the expression of claspin in 89 PCa cases, of which 31 (35%) were positive for claspin. Claspin-positive cases were associated with higher Gleason score, venous invasion, and perineural invasion. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that high claspin expression was related to poor prostate-specific antigen (PSA) relapse-free prognosis. In a public database, high CLSPN expression was associated with poor PSA relapse-free prognosis, Gleason score, T stage, lymph node metastasis, CRPC, and metastatic PCa. Claspin knockdown by siRNA decreased cell proliferation, upregulated DTX sensitivity, and suppressed the expression of Akt, Erk1/2, and CHK1 phosphorylation in DU145 and PC3 cell lines. Furthermore, claspin expression was much more upregulated in DTX-resistant DU145 (DU145-DR) than in parental DU145 cells. Claspin knockdown significantly upregulated the sensitivity to DTX in DU145-DR cells. These results suggest that claspin plays an important role in PCa tumor progression and DTX resistance.""","""['Takashi Babasaki', 'Kazuhiro Sentani', 'Yohei Sekino', 'Go Kobayashi', 'Quoc Thang Pham', 'Narutaka Katsuya', 'Shintaro Akabane', 'Daiki Taniyama', 'Tetsutaro Hayashi', 'Masaki Shiota', 'Naohide Oue', 'Jun Teishima', 'Akio Matsubara', 'Wataru Yasui']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Claspin Overexpression Promotes Tumor Progression and Predicts Poor Clinical Outcome in Prostate Cancer.', 'Microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) promotes bicalutamide resistance and is associated with survival in prostate cancer.', 'Long noncoding RNA MALAT1 enhances the docetaxel resistance of prostate cancer cells via miR-145-5p-mediated regulation of AKAP12.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

In this report, we also examine trends in stage-specific survival for melanoma of the skin (melanoma).  Methods:   Incidence data for all cancers from 2001 through 2017 and survival data for melanoma cases diagnosed during 2001-2014 and followed-up through 2016 were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention- and National Cancer Institute-funded population-based cancer registry programs compiled by the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Data on cancer deaths from 2001 to 2018 were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics' National Vital Statistics System. Trends in age-standardized incidence and death rates and 2-year relative survival were estimated by joinpoint analysis, and trends in incidence and mortality were expressed as average annual percent change (AAPC) during the most recent 5 years (2013-2017 for incidence and 2014-2018 for mortality).  Results:   Overall cancer incidence rates (per 100 000 population) for all ages during 2013-2017 were 487.4 among males and 422.4 among females. During this period, incidence rates remained stable among males but slightly increased in females (AAPC = 0.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.1% to 0.2%). Overall cancer death rates (per 100 000 population) during 2014-2018 were 185.5 among males and 133.5 among females. During this period, overall death rates decreased in both males (AAPC = -2.2%, 95% CI = -2.5% to -1.9%) and females (AAPC = -1.7%, 95% CI = -2.1% to -1.4%); death rates decreased for 11 of the 19 most common cancers among males and for 14 of the 20 most common cancers among females, but increased for 5 cancers in each sex. During 2014-2018, the declines in death rates accelerated for lung cancer and melanoma, slowed down for colorectal and female breast cancers, and leveled off for prostate cancer. Among children younger than age 15 years and adolescents and young adults aged 15-39 years, cancer death rates continued to decrease in contrast to the increasing incidence rates. Two-year relative survival for distant-stage skin melanoma was stable for those diagnosed during 2001-2009 but increased by 3.1% (95% CI = 2.8% to 3.5%) per year for those diagnosed during 2009-2014, with comparable trends among males and females.  Conclusions:   Cancer death rates in the United States continue to decline overall and for many cancer types, with the decline accelerated for lung cancer and melanoma. For several other major cancers, however, death rates continue to increase or previous declines in rates have slowed or ceased. Moreover, overall incidence rates continue to increase among females, children, and adolescents and young adults. These findings inform efforts related to prevention, early detection, and treatment and for broad and equitable implementation of effective interventions, especially among under resourced populations.""","""['Farhad Islami', 'Elizabeth M Ward', 'Hyuna Sung', 'Kathleen A Cronin', 'Florence K L Tangka', 'Recinda L Sherman', 'Jingxuan Zhao', 'Robert N Anderson', 'S Jane Henley', 'K Robin Yabroff', 'Ahmedin Jemal', 'Vicki B Benard']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst""","""['Cancer Surveillance Opportunities to Meet Prevention and Control Challenges.', 'Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, part I: National cancer statistics.', 'Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, part 1: National cancer statistics.', 'Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer, part I: National cancer statistics.', 'Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, 1975-2000, featuring the uses of surveillance data for cancer prevention and control.', 'Cancers with increasing incidence trends in the United States: 1999 through 2008.', 'Reduction-responsive nucleic acid nanocarrier-mediated miR-22 inhibition of PI3K/AKT pathway for the treatment of patient-derived tumor xenograft osteosarcoma.', 'Trends in Cancer Incidence in Different Antiretroviral Treatment-Eras amongst People with HIV.', 'Cancer Prevalence Across Vertebrates.', 'Methods for Evaluating the Efficacy of Medical Castration: A Systematic Review.', 'US Cancer Mortality Trends Among Hispanic Populations From 1999 to 2020.']"""

We created an automated analytics platform to calculate the impact of the RO Model vs historical fee-for-service episode reimbursements for brachytherapy treatments within five community oncology practices for prostate, uterine, and cervical cancer.  Methods and materials:   Claims data between January 1, 2017 and October 2, 2019 for prostate, uterine, and cervical cancer were analyzed as per the RO Model Final Rule methodology. Expected professional and technical component (PC and TC) reimbursements were compared for episodes that utilized brachytherapy alone vs combination modality (external beam and brachytherapy) in the RO Model vs historical reimbursements.  Results:   6,022 RO Model-defined episodes (60% prostate, 28% uterine, 13% cervical) were generated. Brachytherapy monotherapy episodes (14%) would have an average positive reimbursement in the RO Model (+$2,163 for prostate, +$711 for uterine, +$533 for cervical for the PC; +$12,168 for prostate, +$8,181 for uterine, +$11,322 for cervical for the TC), while combination modality episodes (15%) would have an average negative reimbursement in the RO Model (-$183 for prostate, -$1,701 for uterine, -$2,195 for cervical for the PC; -$374 for prostate, -$5,026 for uterine, -$2,801 for cervical for the TC).  Conclusions:   Brachytherapy monotherapy episodes for prostate, uterine, and cervical cancer will benefit from an increase in payment, whereas combination modality episodes will receive lower reimbursement. Large shifts in episodic payment may be related to practice-wide adjustments and pricing based on partial episodes of care that may ultimately limit access to care for vulnerable patient populations with cancer.""","""['Nikhil G Thaker', 'Rehman Meghani', 'Cassandra Wilson', 'Jody Garey', 'Philip Nelson', 'Gautam H Thaker', 'Chirag Shah', 'Peter Orio', 'Catheryn M Yashar', 'Vivek Kavadi']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Automated Big Data Analytics for the Radiation Oncology Alternative Payment Model Proposal Using a Novel Health Care Software Technology.', 'Impact of Patient Stage and Disease Characteristics on the proposed Radiation Oncology Alternative Payment Model (RO-APM).', 'Impact of Radiation Oncology Alternative Payment Model on Community Cancer Centers.', 'Fractionated high-dose-rate brachytherapy in the management of uterine cervical cancer.', 'American Brachytherapy Society radiation oncology alternative payment model task force: Quality measures and metrics for brachytherapy.', 'Treatment of cervical cancer: overcoming challenges in access to brachytherapy.']"""

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with targeted biopsy has shown the potential to address this challenge, but the implications of its use in the context of organized prostate cancer screening are unknown.  Methods:   We conducted a population-based noninferiority trial of prostate cancer screening in which men 50 to 74 years of age from the general population were invited by mail to participate; participants with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels of 3 ng per milliliter or higher were randomly assigned, in a 2:3 ratio, to undergo a standard biopsy (standard biopsy group) or to undergo MRI, with targeted and standard biopsy if the MRI results suggested prostate cancer (experimental biopsy group). The primary outcome was the proportion of men in the intention-to-treat population in whom clinically significant cancer (Gleason score ≥7) was diagnosed. A key secondary outcome was the detection of clinically insignificant cancers (Gleason score 6).  Results:   Of 12,750 men enrolled, 1532 had PSA levels of 3 ng per milliliter or higher and were randomly assigned to undergo biopsy: 603 were assigned to the standard biopsy group and 929 to the experimental biopsy group. In the intention-to-treat analysis, clinically significant cancer was diagnosed in 192 men (21%) in the experimental biopsy group, as compared with 106 men (18%) in the standard biopsy group (difference, 3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1 to 7; P<0.001 for noninferiority). The percentage of clinically insignificant cancers was lower in the experimental biopsy group than in the standard biopsy group (4% [41 participants] vs. 12% [73 participants]; difference, -8 percentage points; 95% CI, -11 to -5).  Conclusions:   MRI with targeted and standard biopsy in men with MRI results suggestive of prostate cancer was noninferior to standard biopsy for detecting clinically significant prostate cancer in a population-based screening-by-invitation trial and resulted in less detection of clinically insignificant cancer.

Radiotherapy is the ideal treatment for non-metastatic prostate cancer (PCa), but the effectiveness of radiotherapy is greatly discounted due to radio resistance. Therefore, relieving the radiotherapy resistance of PCa is key to improve the clinical efficacy of PCA.  Main methods:   Cell proliferation was estimated using the MTT and clone formation assays. Cell apoptosis was estimated using the Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide (PI) staining assay. Glucose uptake and lactose and ATP production were used to detect glycolysis.  Key findings:   miR-223-3p was significantly upregulated in clinically collected urine samples and PCa cells with low radiosensitivity. Enhancing miR-223-3p reduced radiosensitivity further, while inhibiting miR-223-3p improved the radiosensitivity of PC3 and LNCaP cells. Importantly, miR-223-3p regulated radiosensitivity by enhancing cell glycolysis. FOXO3a was a key target of miRNA-223-3p regulating glycolysis and radiosensitivity. Overexpression of FOXO3a abated the glycolysis level and alleviated the radioresistance caused by enhancing miR-223-3p to a certain extent.  Significance:   This is novel research on the role of miR-223-3p in promoting radiotherapy resistance of PCa cells by activating glycolysis.

However, its biological functions and clinical importance in malignant melanoma (MM) are still unclear. Understanding the potential mechanism underlying the regulation of MM progression by DDX52 might lead to novel therapeutic strategies. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of DDX52 in the regulation of MM progression and its clinical relevance. DDX52 expression in normal and MM tissues was evaluated by GEO analysis and immunohistochemistry. The effects of DDX52 on cell growth were evaluated in MM cells with downregulated DDX52 expression. In this study, we found that DDX52 was markedly overexpressed in MM tissues compared with nontumor tissues and was associated with shorter overall survival in patients; therefore, DDX52 might be a prognostic marker in MM. Downregulation of DDX52 expression in the MM cell lines A2058 and MV3 markedly inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation. Additionally, knockdown of DDX52 in MM cells caused significant regression of established tumors in nude mice and delayed the onset time. Moreover, downregulation of DDX52 markedly suppressed c-Myc mRNA and protein expression, and an RNA immunoprecipitation assay confirmed the association between DDX52 and c-Myc. Restoration of c-Myc expression partly rescued the effects of DDX52 deficiency in MM cells.

Exogenous overexpressed ARv7 can function as a homodimer or heterodimer with full length AR (ARfl), which is highly expressed with ARv7 in CRPC. However, the extent to which endogenous ARv7 function is dependent on heterodimerization with ARfl remains to be determined. We used double-crosslinking to stabilize AR complexes on chromatin in a CRPC cell line expressing endogenous ARfl and ARv7 (LN95 cells), and established that only trace levels of ARfl were associated with ARv7 on chromatin.

Determining how various demographic, geographic, and funding factors contributed to cancer incidence on a state and county level helps improve cancer prevention and control.  Objectives:   We examined cancer incidence rate trends by demographic (sex and ethnicity) and geographic (county, population, rural/frontier status) factors. We also examined cancer funding and research output by year.  Methods:   Cancer incidence rates were obtained from the North Dakota Cancer Registry and stratified by sex, ethnicity, and county.

Results:   Male melanoma incidence rates increased faster than the US average across year P = 0.020). Incidence rates for prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer among American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/AN) decreased faster than Whites across year (P < 0.001, P= 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively). Four counties-2 for breast cancer and 2 for prostate cancer-had differential trends compared to the North Dakota average across year (P = 0.011, P = 0.029; P= 0.046, P = 0.042).

This is especially relevant in prostate cancer (PCa), wherein the diagnostic capability of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) dramatically drops when considering patients with PSA levels ranging from 3 to 10 ng/mL, the so-called grey zone. Hence, additional noninvasive diagnostic and/or prognostic PCa biomarkers are urgently needed, especially in the metabolic-status context.  Objective:   To assess the potential relation of urine In1-ghrelin (a ghrelin-splicing variant) levels with metabolic-related/pathological conditions (eg, obesity, diabetes, body mass index, insulin and glucose levels) and to define its potential clinical value in PCa (diagnostic/prognostic capacity) and relationship with PCa risk in patients with PSA in the grey zone.  Methods:   Urine In1-ghrelin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay in a clinically, metabolically, pathologically well-characterized cohort of patients without (n = 397) and with (n = 213) PCa with PSA in the grey zone.  Results:   Key obesity-related factors associated with PCa risk (BMI, diabetes, glucose and insulin levels) were strongly correlated to In1-ghrelin levels. Importantly, In1-ghrelin levels were higher in PCa patients compared to control patients with suspect of PCa but negative biopsy). Moreover, high In1-ghrelin levels were associated with increased PCa risk and linked to PCa aggressiveness (eg, tumor stage, lymphovascular invasion). In1-ghrelin levels added significant diagnostic value to a clinical model consisting of age, suspicious digital rectal exam, previous biopsy, and PSA levels. Furthermore, a multivariate model consisting of clinical and metabolic variables, including In1-ghrelin levels, showed high specificity and sensitivity to diagnose PCa (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.740).

Thus, we hypothesized that an ""NLP-assisted"" extraction system, which uses humans for complicated notes and NLP for uncomplicated notes, could produce faster extraction without compromising accuracy.  Objective:   The aim of this study was to develop and pilot an NLP-assisted extraction system to leverage the strengths of both human and NLP extraction of prostate cancer Gleason scores.  Methods:   We collected all available clinical and pathology notes for prostate cancer patients in an unselected academic biobank cohort. We developed an NLP system to extract prostate cancer Gleason scores from both clinical and pathology notes. Next, we designed and implemented the NLP-assisted extraction system algorithm to categorize notes into ""uncomplicated"" and ""complicated"" notes. Uncomplicated notes were assigned to NLP extraction and complicated notes were assigned to human extraction. We randomly reviewed 200 patients to assess the accuracy and speed of our NLP-assisted extraction system and compared it to NLP extraction alone and human extraction alone.  Results:   Of the 2051 patients in our cohort, the NLP system extracted a prostate surgery Gleason score from 1147 (55.92%) patients and a prostate biopsy Gleason score from 1624 (79.18%) patients. Our NLP-assisted extraction system had an overall accuracy rate of 98.7%, which was similar to the accuracy of human extraction alone (97.5%; P=.17) and significantly higher than the accuracy of NLP extraction alone (95.3%; P<.001). Moreover, our NLP-assisted extraction system reduced the workload of human extractors by approximately 95%, resulting in an average extraction time of 12.7 seconds per patient (vs 256.1 seconds per patient for human extraction alone).

Using tissue microarrays, multiplex immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence, and automated digital pathology, we analyzed radical prostatectomy specimens from two large patient cohorts (training: n = 470; validation: n = 333) to determine infiltration levels of seven immune cell types in malignant versus benign prostate tissue: CD3+ CD8- FoxP3- T helper cells, CD3+ CD8+ FoxP3- cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), CD3+ CD8- FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs ), CD20+ B cells, CD68+ CD163- M1 macrophages, CD68+ CD163+ M2 macrophages, and tryptase+ mast cells. Results were further validated by cell type enrichment analyses of bulk tumor RNAseq data from a third independent patient cohort (n = 99). Prognostic potential was assessed by Kaplan-Meier and uni-/multi-variate Cox regression analyses. Clinical endpoint was biochemical recurrence. All seven immune cell types were enriched in prostate cancer versus benign stroma, while there was selective enrichment for B cells, Tregs , M1 and M2 macrophages, and depletion of mast cells and CTLs in prostate cancer epithelium. In all three cohorts, high levels of infiltrating Tregs , M1, and M2 macrophages in stroma and/or epithelium were associated with biochemical recurrence (p < 0.05; log-rank test). After adjustment for routine clinical variables, Tregs and M2 macrophages remained significant adverse predictors of biochemical recurrence (p < 0.05; multivariate Cox regression).

Methods:   The study included AS patients with biopsy-proven PCa with a minimum follow-up of 2 years and at least one repeat targeted biopsy. Histopathological progression was defined as grade group progression from diagnostic biopsy. The control group included patients with both radiologically and histopathologically stable disease. PRECISE scores were applied prospectively by four uro-radiologists with 5-16 years' experience. T2WI- and ADC-derived delta-radiomics features were computed using baseline and latest available MRI scans, with the predictive modelling performed using the parenclitic networks (PN), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression, and random forests (RF) algorithms. Standard measures of discrimination and areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) were calculated, with AUCs compared using DeLong's test.  Results:   The study included 64 patients (27 progressors and 37 non-progressors) with a median follow-up of 46 months. PRECISE scores had the highest specificity (94.7%) and positive predictive value (90.9%), whilst RF had the highest sensitivity (92.6%) and negative predictive value (92.6%) for predicting disease progression. The AUC for PRECISE (84.4%) was non-significantly higher than AUCs of 81.5%, 78.0%, and 80.9% for PN, LASSO regression, and RF, respectively (p = 0.64, 0.43, and 0.57, respectively). No significant differences were observed between AUCs of the three delta-radiomics models (p-value range 0.34-0.77).  Conclusions:   PRECISE and delta-radiomics models achieved comparably good performance for predicting PCa progression in AS patients.

LncRNA AGAP2 antisense RNA 1 (AGAP2-AS1) can serve as an oncogenic role in some cancers, including prostate cancer (PCa). However, the underling mechanism of such lncRNA in PCa has not been fully studied. Therefore, it is meaningful to investigate the role and underlying mechanism of AGAP2-AS1 in PCa. AGAP2-AS1 was confirmed to be highly expressed in PCa cells. Functionally, AGAP2-AS1 silencing inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition process and induced apoptosis. According to mechanism assays, AGAP2-AS1 sponged miR-628-5p, which was found to restrain PCa cell growth. Besides, FOXP2 was identified as a target gene of miR-628-5p, and its expression was negatively regulated by miR-628-5p and positively modulated by AGAP2-AS1. Importantly, we found that FOXP2 could function as the upstream gene of AGAP2-AS1. Through rescue experiments, we discovered that FOXP2 up-regulation countered AGAP2-AS1 knockdown-mediated inhibition on PCa cell growth. Finally, it was found that AGAP2-AS1 could activate WNT pathway, and LiCl could reverse the influence of AGAP2-AS1 on PCa biological behaviors.

Long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) have been suggested to be dysregulated in various types of cancers, and a growing number of lincRNAs have been implicated to be functional in the ESCC progression. In this study, we examined the role of linc00941 in the ESCC progression and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms. The bioinformatics analysis identified the up-regulation of linc00941 in the ESCC tissues. Further in vitro studies showed that linc00941 was up-regulated in ESCC cell lines. The loss-of-function studies demonstrated that linc00941 knockdown suppressed ESCC cell proliferation, invasion and migration, and also suppressed the in vivo tumor growth. Furthermore, bioinformatics prediction along with luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay implied that linc00941 acted as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-877-3p, and linc00941 regulated ESCC cell progression via at least targeting miR-877-3p. Subsequently, miR-877-3p targeted prostate transmembrane protein, androgen induced 1 (PMEPA1) 3' untranslated region and repressed PMEPA1 expression in ESCC cells; overexpression of PMEPA1 attenuated the inhibitory effects of linc00941 knockdown on the ESCC cell progression.

Surveillance varies in MRI, frequency of follow-up, and the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score that would repeat biopsy. Purpose To compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of AS strategies for low-risk PC with versus without MRI. Materials and Methods This study developed a mathematical model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of surveillance strategies in a simulation of men with a diagnosis of low-risk PC. The following strategies were compared: watchful waiting, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and annual biopsy without MRI, and PSA testing and MRI with varied PI-RADS thresholds for biopsy. MRI strategies differed regarding scheduling and use of PI-RADS score of at least 3, or a PI-RADS score of at least 4 to indicate the need for biopsy. Life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated by using microsimulation. Sensitivity analysis was used to assess the impact of varying parameter values on results. Results For the base case of 60-year-old men, all strategies incorporating prostate MRI extended QALYs and life-years compared with watchful waiting and non-MRI strategies. Annual MRI strategies yielded 16.19 QALYs, annual biopsy with no MRI yielded 16.14 QALYs, and watchful waiting yielded 15.94 QALYs. Annual MRI with PI-RADS score of at least 3 or of at least 4 as the biopsy threshold and annual MRI with biopsy even after MRI with negative findings offered similar QALYs and the same unadjusted life expectancy: 23.05 life-years. However, a PI-RADS score of at least 4 yielded 42% fewer lifetime biopsies. With a cost-effectiveness threshold of $100 000 per QALY, annual MRI with biopsy for lesions with PI-RADS scores of 4 or greater was most cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, $67 221 per QALY). Age, treatment type, risk of initial grade misclassification, and quality-of-life impact of procedural complications affected results. Conclusion The use of active surveillance (AS) with biopsy decisions guided by findings from annual MRI reduces the number of biopsies while preserving life expectancy and quality of life. Biopsy in lesions with PI-RADS scores of 4 or greater is likely the most cost-effective AS strategy for men with low-risk prostate cancer who are younger than 70 years. © RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

Purpose To determine the incidence of PE in patients with COVID-19 and its associations with clinical and laboratory parameters. Materials and Methods In this HIPAA-compliant study, electronic medical records were searched retrospectively for demographic, clinical, and laboratory data and outcomes among patients with COVID-19 admitted at four hospitals from March through June 2020. PE found at CT pulmonary angiography and perfusion scintigraphy was correlated with clinical and laboratory parameters. The d-dimer level was used to predict PE, and the obtained threshold was externally validated among 85 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at a fifth hospital. The association between right-sided heart strain and embolic burden was evaluated in patients with PE undergoing echocardiography. Results A total of 413 patients with COVID-19 (mean age, 60 years ± 16 [standard deviation]; age range, 20-98 years; 230 men) were evaluated. PE was diagnosed in 102 (25%; 95% CI: 21, 29) of 413 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who underwent CT pulmonary angiography or perfusion scintigraphy. PE was observed in 21 (29%; 95% CI: 19, 41) of 73 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) versus 81 (24%; 95% CI: 20, 29) of 340 patients who were not in the ICU (P = .37). PE was associated with male sex (odds ratio [OR], 1.74; 95% CI: 1.1, 2.8; P = .02); smoking (OR, 1.86; 95% CI: 1.0, 3.4; P = .04); and increased d-dimer (P < .001), lactate dehydrogenase (P < .001), ferritin (P = .001), and interleukin-6 (P = .02) levels. Mortality in hospitalized patients was similar between patients with PE and those without PE (14% [13 of 102]; 95% CI: 8, 22] vs 13% [40 of 311]; 95% CI: 9, 17; P = .98), suggesting that diagnosis and treatment of PE were not associated with excess mortality. The d-dimer levels greater than 1600 ng/mL [8.761 nmol/L] helped predict PE with 100% sensitivity and 62% specificity in an external validation cohort. Embolic burden was higher in patients with right-sided heart strain among the patients with PE undergoing echocardiography (P = .03). Conclusion Pulmonary embolism (PE) incidence was 25% in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 suspected of having PE. A d-dimer level greater than 1600 ng/mL [8.761 nmol/L] was sensitive for identification of patients who needed CT pulmonary angiography. © RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

However, the selection of 223 Ra is not guided by specific validated clinicopathologic factors, and thus outcomes are heterogeneous.  Patients and methods:   This retrospective survival analysis was performed in men with mCRPC treated with 223 Ra at our cancer center. Demographics and disease characteristics were collected. OS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method (log-rank). The potential prognostic factors were determined using both univariable (UVA) and multivariable analysis (MVA) (Cox-regression) methods.  Results:   In total, 150 patients with a median age of 74 years (52-93) received 223 Ra between May 2015 and July 2018, and 58% had 6-20 bone metastases. Ninety-four (63%) patients received >4 223 Ra doses, and 56 (37%) received ≤4. The following pre-treatment factors were analyzed (median [range]): eastern cooperative oncology group performance status (ECOG PS), (1 [0-3]); Albumin (ALB), (39 g/L [24-47]); alkaline phosphatase (ALP), (110 U/L [35-1633]); and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), (49 µg/L [0.83-7238]). The median OS for all patients was 14.5 months (95% CI: 11.2-18). These factors were associated with poor survival outcomes in UVA and MVA: ALB <35 g/L, ALP >150 U/L, ECOG PS 2-3, and PSA >80 µg/L. By assigning one point for each of these factors, a prognostic model was developed, wherein three distinct risk groups were identified: good, 0-1 (n = 103); intermediate, 2 (n = 30); and poor risk, 3-4 points (n = 17). The median OS was 19.4, 10.0, and 3.1 months, respectively (p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Pre-treatment ALB, ALP, ECOG, and PSA, were significantly correlated with OS and could guide treatment selection for men with mCRPC by identifying those who are most or least likely to benefit from 223 Ra.

While multi-gene testing has been proposed, evidence for their association with PCa risk is not well established.  Methods:   We tested associations of pathogenic/likely pathogenic mutations in 10 guideline-recommended genes (ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, PALB2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and HOXB13) with PCa risk in the UK Biobank, a population-based cohort. Mutations were annotated based on prostate-specific transcripts using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics standards. Associations were tested in 4399 PCa cases and 85,403 unaffected male controls using logistic regression adjusting for age and genetic background. p < .005 was considered significant based on Bonferroni correction.  Results:   Among the 10 tested genes, significantly higher mutation carrier rates in PCa cases versus controls were found for four genes at p < .005; HOXB13, BRCA2, ATM, and CHEK2, with odds ratios (95% confidence interval) estimated at 4.96 (3.62-6.69), 3.23 (2.23-4.56), 2.95 (2.01-4.22), 1.94 (1.43-2.58), respectively. No significant association was found between mutation carrier status and age at PCa diagnosis or family history of PCa. Despite the large sample size of this study, statistical power remains limited, especially for genes where pathogenic mutation carrier rates are extremely rare (<0.03%).  Conclusion:   Observed evidence for PCa risk was found for four of the 10 guideline-recommended genes in this large population-based study.

However, its significance as a biomarker in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), both alone and in conjunction with co-occurring AR alterations using a liquid biopsy approach has not been investigated.  Methods:   Ninety-one patients were included in this study, (n = 68 receiving an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor and n = 23 receiving taxane chemotherapy). Up to 30 ml of peripheral blood was collected before commencing treatment from each patient. Plasma cell-free DNA, along with a matched germline sample, underwent targeted next-generation sequencing using a validated, highly sensitive in-house prostate cancer panel. Variants in AR and NCOA2 were identified and correlated with clinical outcomes.  Results:   Plasma AR and NCOA2 aberrations were identified in 35% and 13% of the cohort, respectively, whilst 8% had concurrent AR and NCOA2 alterations. NCOA2 copy number gain and any NCOA2 aberration predicted for lower prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rates. Likewise, median overall survival was shorter for NCOA2 gain (10.1 vs. 18.3 months; p = .004), remaining significant after adjusting for covariates including circulating tumor DNA fraction and tumor suppressor gene alterations. Importantly, dual AR and NCOA2 aberrations were also associated with inferior outcomes, including no PSA responses in patients treated with AR pathway inhibitors (0% vs. 64%; p = .02).

Since extrapulmonary small cell carcinomas (SCCs) are less common, treatment paradigms are reasonably extrapolated from SCLC regimens. We examined our institution's experience utilizing the combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy (as used in SCLC) for SCC and neuroendocrine carcinoma of the prostate.  Methods:   Utilizing an institutional database search tool, we queried the electronic medical record to identify patients with SCC or neuroendocrine carcinoma of the prostate who had been treated with atezolizumab and chemotherapy. We recorded patient characteristics, including age, pathology, and disease extent. Treatment characteristics included number of prior treatments, use of concominant androgen deprivation, number of cycles of immunotherapy, and prior systemic therapies (including those for adenocarcinoma of the prostate). Progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were the primary outcomes.  Results:   We identified seven men who received atezolizumab for metastatic prostate cancer with a small cell or neuroendocrine component. In six of the seven patients, the combination of carboplatin, etoposide, and atezolizumab was the first-line of treatment after diagnosis of small cell or neuroendocrine carcinoma. Two of the seven patients had de novo small cell/neuroendocrine pathology, while the other five had transformation from a preexisting adenocarcinoma. In the patients who received chemotherapy plus immunotherapy in the first-line setting, at a median follow-up of 6.5 months (range: 1.5-15.1) the median PFS was 3.4 months and median OS was 8.4 months.  Conclusion:   Small cell or neuroendocrine carcinoma of the prostate was associated with poor survival outcomes despite adding immunotherapy (atezolizumab) to chemotherapy (carboplatin and etoposide). To our knowledge, there has been no demonstrable benefit of adding immunotherapy to chemotherapy in this setting.""","""['Christopher E Wee', 'Brian A Costello', 'Jacob J Orme', 'J Fernando Quevedo', 'Lance C Pagliaro']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Updated Overall Survival and PD-L1 Subgroup Analysis of Patients With Extensive-Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer Treated With Atezolizumab, Carboplatin, and Etoposide (IMpower133).', 'Platinum Doublet plus Atezolizumab as First-line Treatment in Metastatic Large Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma: A Single Institution Experience.', 'Atezolizumab in combination with carboplatin plus nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone as first-line treatment for metastatic non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (IMpower130): a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial.', 'Atezolizumab: A Review in Extensive-Stage SCLC.', 'FDA Approval Summary: Atezolizumab and Durvalumab in Combination with Platinum-Based Chemotherapy in Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'De novo large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the prostate: A case report and literature review.', 'Review of Checkpoint Inhibitor Immunotherapy in Neuroendocrine Tumor of Prostate and Our Experience in 2 Cases.']"""

No nomograms have been developed to predict csPCa in such populations. In this study, we aimed to develop and validate a model for predicting the probability of csPCa in men with negative MRI (PI-RADS score 1-2) results after transrectal ultrasound-guided systematic prostate biopsy.  Methods:   The development cohort consisted of 728 patients with negative MRI results who underwent subsequent prostate biopsy at our center between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2017. The patients' clinicopathologic data were recorded. The Lasso regression was used for data dimension reduction and feature selection, then multivariable binary logistic regression was used to build a predictive model with regression coefficients. The model was validated in an independent cohort of 334 consecutive patients from January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2020. The performance of the predictive model was assessed with respect to discrimination, calibration, and decision curve analysis.  Results:   The predictors incorporated in this model included age, history of previous negative prostate biopsy, prostate specific antigen density (PSAD), and lower urinary tract symptoms, with PSAD being the strongest predictor. The model showed good discrimination with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.875 (95% confidence interval, 0.816-0.933) and good calibration (unreliability test, p = .540).

Thus, we aimed to investigate thresholds of [-2] proPSA (p2PSA)-related parameters to predict reclassification of the first-year protocol biopsy (1-year PBx) and evaluate the influence of clinical decision-making.  Methods:   This was an observational, prospective cohort study conducted at 19 Japanese institutes. The inclusion criteria included clinical stage T1c/T2, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels ≤10 ng/mL, PSA density <0.2 ng/ml/cc, one or two positive biopsy cores, and Gleason score (GS) ≤6 (GS ≦7 for patients aged ≥70 years) at diagnostic biopsy. All participants were required to receive a blood-sampling test on a protocol visit at inclusion and at the 1-year PBx. PSA and PSA isoforms (free PSA, p2PSA) were measured, and parameters (%free PSA, %p2PSA, phi) were calculated. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to predict the reclassification risk. To assess the predictive power and thresholds for reclassification, we plotted Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to evaluate the variables that yielded a net clinical benefit.  Results:   A total of 135 patients were included, and 36 patients were reclassified on the 1-year PBx. Multivariate analyses showed that %p2PSA and phi at inclusion and p2PSA, %p2PSA, and phi before the 1-year PBx were significant predictors of reclassification at the 1-year PBx. The ROC analysis showed an optimal cutoff point, sensitivity, and specificity of %p2PSA and phi before the 1-year PBx of 1.64, 86%, 49% and 35.92, 89%, 47%, respectively. The DCA showed that phi before the 1-year PBx had the highest net benefit. The study limitation was its single-arm observational design.  Conclusions:   %p2PSA and phi before the 1-year PBx had a good prediction power. phi is the most useful indicator for clinical decision-making on active surveillance.

While the majority of patients responds to PSMA-RLT, with 10-15% having an exceptional response, approximately 30% of patients is unresponsive to PSMA-RLT. The molecular underpinning may in part explain these varying responses. This study investigated alterations in DNA damage repair (DDR) genes in tumour biopsies and their association with response to PSMA-RLT.  Methods:   A predefined retrospective cohort study was performed in mCRPC patients of whom the tumours had undergone next-generation sequencing of 40 DDR genes and received Lu-177-PSMA and/or Ac-225-PSMA-RLT. The primary outcome of this study was to compare the progression free survival (PFS) after PSMA-RLT for patients with and without pathogenic DDR aberrations in their tumour. Secondary outcomes were prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response and overall survival (OS).  Results:   A total of 40 patients were included of which seventeen had a tumour with a pathogenic DDR aberration (DDR+), of which eight had defects in BRCA1/2. DDR+ patients had an equal varying response to PSMA-RLT compared to those without pathological DDR anomalies (DDR-) in terms of PFS (5.9 vs. 6.4 months, respectively; HR 1.14; 95% CI 0.58-2.25; p = 0.71), ≥50% PSA response (59% vs. 65%, respectively; p = 0.75) or OS (11.1 vs. 10.7 months, respectively; HR 1.40; 95% CI: 0.68-2.91; p = 0.36).

PSMs occurred mostly in the posterolateral regions (73.8%) which were associated with nerve-sparing procedures (p = 0.012) while apical PSMs were correlated intraoperative bleeding (p < 0.001). A high ratio of pT3 stage after RARP in our Asian population-based might surpass the influence of PSM on BCR. PSM was less significant than PSA and ISUP grade for predicting PSA recurrence in pT3 disease. Among PSM cases, unifocal and multifocal positive margins had a similar ratio of the BCR rate (p = 0.172) but ISUP grade > 3 (p = 0.002; HR 2.689) was a significant BCR predictor.

Here, we compare germline and somatic variants in DDR genes, specifically looking at their locations in the corresponding three-dimensional (3D) structures, Pfam domains, and protein-protein interaction interfaces. We show that somatic variants in metastatic cases are more likely to be found in Pfam domains and protein interaction interfaces than are pathogenic germline variants or variants of unknown significance (VUS). We also show that there are hotspots in the structures of ATM and BRCA2 proteins where pathogenic germline, and recurrent somatic variants from primary and metastatic tumours, cluster together in 3D. Moreover, in the ATM, BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes from prostate cancer patients, the distributions of germline benign, pathogenic, VUS, and recurrent somatic variants differ across Pfam domains.

Thrombocytopenia, closely followed by symptoms characteristic of gastrointestinal toxicity, have presented as dose-limiting adverse events that may have prevented escalation to higher dose levels required for more robust efficacy. ABBV-744 is a highly selective inhibitor for the second bromodomain of the four BET family proteins. In contrast to the broad antiproliferative activities observed with dual bromodomain BET inhibitors, ABBV-744 displayed significant antiproliferative activities largely although not exclusively in cancer cell lines derived from acute myeloid leukemia and androgen receptor positive prostate cancer.

Patients and methods:   Between February 2018 and August 2019, 205 low-, intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer patients were treated with SBRT using ""CyberKnife M6"" linear accelerator. In low-risk patients 7.5-8 Gy was delivered to the prostate gland by each fraction. For intermediate- and high-risk disease a dose of 7.5-8 Gy was delivered to the prostate and 6-6.5 Gy to the seminal vesicles by each fraction with a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) technique. A total of 5 fractions (total dose 37.5-40 Gy) were given on every second working day. Acute radiotherapy-related genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) side effects were assessed using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) scoring system.  Results:   Of the 205 patients (28 low-, 115 intermediate-, 62 high-risk) treated with SBRT, 203 (99%) completed the radiotherapy as planned. The duration of radiation therapy was 1 week and 3 days. The frequencies of acute radiotherapy-related side effects were as follows: GU grade 0 - 17.1%, grade I - 30.7%, grade II - 50.7%, grade III - 1.5%; and GI grade 0 - 62.4%, grade I-31.7%, grade II-5.9%, grade III-0%. None of the patients developed grade ≥ 4 acute toxicity.  Conclusions:   SBRT with a total dose of 37.5-40 Gy in 5 fractions appears to be a safe and well tolerated treatment option in patients with prostate cancer, associated with slight or moderate early side effects.

Methods:   This IRB-approved retrospective, single-center, cross-sectional study included patients with BC wo underwent 3 Tesla preoperative multiparametric (mp)-MRI including T2-weighted (T2w), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) sequences. An independent evaluation according to VI-RADS was performed by two radiologists in separate sessions, blinded to histological findings.  Results:   The mean age of 59 included patients was 68.2 (±13.6 standard deviation) years. Among bladder cancer patients, 26 (51%) were identified as high grade and 14 (27.5%) as muscle invasive urothelial carcinomas in histological sections. The area under the curve (AUC) for the overall VI-RADS score to predict muscle invasion was 0.986 (R1) and 0.992 (R2). The AUC to diagnose high grade bladder cancer was 0.908 (R1) and 0.905 (R2). There was no significance difference between the AUC of single parameters (T2w, DWI and DCE) compared to the total VI-RADS score (P > 0.05, respectively). Upon multivariate logistic regression, only the T2w VI-RADS score contributed independently to the diagnosis of high grade and muscle invasive bladder cancer (P = 0.001 (R1) and P = 0.0022 (R2) for high grade cancer; P = 0.0007 (R1) and P = 0.0019 (R2) for muscle invasiveness).

This induces a need for the development of an analytical method for the quantification of camostat and its metabolites in plasma samples. Camostat is, however, very unstable in whole blood and plasma due to its two ester bonds. The molecule is readily hydrolysed by esterases to 4-(4-guanidinobenzoyloxy)phenylacetic acid (GBPA) and further to 4-guanidinobenzoic acid (GBA). For reliable quantification of camostat, a technique is required that can instantly inhibit esterases when blood samples are collected.  Design and methods:   An ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS) using stable isotopically labelled analogues as internal standards was developed and validated. Different esterase inhibitors were tested for their ability to stop the hydrolysis of camostat ester bonds.  Results:   Both diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) and paraoxon were discovered as efficient inhibitors of camostat metabolism at 10 mM concentrations. No significant changes in camostat and GBPA concentrations were observed in fluoride-citrate-DFP/paraoxon-preserved plasma after 24 h of storage at room temperature or 4 months of storage at -20 °C and -80 °C. The lower limits of quantification were 0.1 ng/mL for camostat and GBPA and 0.2 ng/mL for GBA. The mean true extraction recoveries were greater than 90%. The relative intra-laboratory reproducibility standard deviations were at a maximum of 8% at concentrations of 1-800 ng/mL. The trueness expressed as the relative bias of the test results was within ±3% at concentrations of 1-800 ng/mL.

This pilot imaging study in humans focuses on midgut neuroendocrine carcinoma metastatic to the liver, evaluating the effect of pretreatment with the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat on uptake of 123I-MIBG and 68Ga-DOTATOC. Materials and Methods: Multiple midgut neuroendocrine liver metastases in clinically stable subjects were imaged with 123I-MIBG and 68Ga-DOTATOC before and after a 4-d course of vorinostat. Scans were performed with strict attention to detail and timed about 1 month apart occurring just before monthly long-acting octreotide administrations. Uptake changes in tumor and normal liver parenchyma were assessed on positron emission computed tomography (PET/CT) with standardized uptake values and on single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with qualitative ratio images. Results: The experimental units were metastatic liver lesions within patients (n = 50). There was no significant difference in administered activity or uptake time between pairs of scans for either radiotracer. Statistically significant increase in maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) averaged over all lesions was noted on the 68Ga-DOTATOC PET scans (+11%, p < 0.01). SUVmax in normal liver showed no significant change (p = 0.12). There was no qualitative change in uptake of 123I-MIBG after vorinostat. Conclusions: In this pilot imaging study in patients with midgut neuroendocrine liver metastases, a short course of the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat induced a statistically significant increase in SUVmax on 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/computed tomography (CT) imaging in some hepatic neuroendocrine tumor metastases. There was no significant effect of vorinostat on tumor uptake of 123I-MIBG on SPECT/CT imaging.

The results of the present study show that the BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 promotes the apoptosis of B16 melanoma cells by altering mitochondrial dynamics, thereby inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and increasing oxidative stress. We found that treatment of B16 cells with different concentrations of JQ1 (125 nmol/L or 250 nmol/L) significantly downregulated the expression of protein subunits involved in mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I, III, IV, and V, increased reactive oxygen species, induced energy metabolism dysfunction, significantly enhanced apoptosis, and activated the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. At the same time, JQ1 inhibited the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, a metabolic energy sensor. In addition, we found that the mRNA and protein levels of mitochondrial dynamin-related protein 1 increased, whereas the levels of mitochondrial fusion protein 1 and optic atrophy protein 1 decreased.

Our primary objective was to assess the role of systematic control biopsies following HIFU-PGA in a cohort of Cs-PCa patients.  Materials and methods:   We studied a single-center retrospective cohort of 77 men treated with HIFU-PGA between October 2015 and December 2019. Patients with unilateral Cs-PCa, defined as Gleason grade group (GGG) ≥2, with visible lesion on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) ≤15 ng/ml were included. All patients underwent mpMRI with systematic and targeted biopsies before and after HIFU-PGA. The primary outcome was the rate of Cs-PCa at control biopsy within 1 year of treatment. Logistic regression was performed to identify predictive factors of our primary outcome.  Results:   Median age was 67 years (IQR 61-71), median PSA was 7 ng/ml (IQR 5.5-8.9). Pre-treatment biopsies revealed 48 (62.3%) GGG2 lesions, 24 (31.2%) GGG3 and 5 (6.5%) GGG4 lesions.

As such, reliable methods for the synthesis and quality control of 225Ac-radiopharmaceuticals are needed.  Objective: 225Ac-PSMA-617 is being used for targeted alpha therapy in patients with prostate cancer, and we had cause to synthesize the agent for preclinical use. However, technology transfer proved cumbersome owing to the paucity of information available on synthesizing and analyzing 225Ac-radiotherapeutics. To address this need, we describe a straightforward synthesis of 225Ac-PSMA- 617 as well as suitable approaches for quality control analysis using standard equipment in a modern PET Center.  Methods:   PSMA-617 precursor was dissolved in 25 μL metal-free water (0.67 mg/mL) and combined with 500 μL 0.05M Tris buffer, pH 9. Actinium stock solution (~65 μCi in 15 μL) was added and the reaction was heated at 120°C for 40-50 min. The reaction was cooled and 0.6 mL gentisic acid solution (4 mg/mL in 0.2 M NH4OAc) was added. To formulate the dose for injection, sterile saline, USP (8 mL) was added and the pH was adjusted by the addition of 100 μL 0.05 M Tris buffer (pH 9) to give a final pH of ~7.2. The final solution was filtered using a 0.22 μm GV sterile filter into a sterile dose vial. Radiochemical purity was determined by radio-TLC (eluent: 50mM Sodium Citrate, pH 5), and plates were analyzed using an AR2000 scanner.  Results:   The method provided 225Ac-PSMA-617 in high radiochemical yield (57 ± 3 μCi, >99%) and radiochemical purity (98 ± 1%), formulated for preclinical studies (9 mL, pH = 7.2), n=3.  Conclusion:   A straightforward synthesis of 225Ac-PSMA-617 is described that will facilitate production for (pre)clinical studies. The approach could also be applicable to the synthesis of other alpha radiotherapeutics incorporating 225Ac.""","""['Alexandra Rae Sowa Dumond', 'Melissa Elizabeth Rodnick', 'Morand Ruediger Piert', 'Peter James Henry Scott']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Curr Radiopharm""","""['Detailed Chemistry Studies of 225Actinium Labeled Radiopharmaceuticals.', 'Preparation of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in Hospital Radiopharmacy: Convenient Formulation of a Clinical Dose Using a Single-Vial Freeze-Dried PSMA-617 Kit Developed In-House.', 'Targeted α-Therapy of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer with 225Ac-PSMA-617: Swimmer-Plot Analysis Suggests Efficacy Regarding Duration of Tumor Control.', 'Advances in targeted alpha therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Theranostics of prostate cancer: from molecular imaging to precision molecular radiotherapy targeting the prostate specific membrane antigen.', 'Radiolabeled PSMA Inhibitors.']"""

However, the cytotoxicity and side reactions associated with singlet oxygen sensitization have posed a problem for using long-wavelength photocatalysis to initiate other types of chemical reactions in biological environments. Herein, silicon-Rhodamine compounds (SiRs) are described as photocatalysts for inducing rapid bioorthogonal chemistry using 660 nm light through the oxidation of a dihydrotetrazine to a tetrazine in the presence of trans-cyclooctene dienophiles. SiRs have been commonly used as fluorophores for bioimaging but have not been applied to catalyze chemical reactions. A series of SiR derivatives were evaluated, and the Janelia Fluor-SiR dyes were found to be especially effective in catalyzing photooxidation (typically 3%). A dihydrotetrazine/tetrazine pair is described that displays high stability in both oxidation states. A protein that was site-selectively modified by trans-cyclooctene was quantitatively conjugated upon exposure to 660 nm light and a dihydrotetrazine. By contrast, a previously described methylene blue catalyst was found to rapidly degrade the protein. SiR-red light photocatalysis was used to cross-link hyaluronic acid derivatives functionalized by dihydrotetrazine and trans-cyclooctenes, enabling 3D culture of human prostate cancer cells. Photoinducible hydrogel formation could also be carried out in live mice through subcutaneous injection of a Cy7-labeled hydrogel precursor solution, followed by brief irradiation to produce a stable hydrogel.

However, identifying CNVs in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has proven to be challenging. With emerging data supporting Akt inhibition in PTEN-deficient mCRPC, we profiled PTEN-PI3K-AKT pathway aberrations in patients with mCRPC using a novel cfDNA assay optimized for CNV detection.  Methods:   A next-generation sequencing-based cfDNA assay was used to profile 231 patients with mCRPC from two independent cohorts (Australian, n = 78; United States, n = 153). PTEN-PI3K-AKT pathway genomic aberrations were correlated with clinical outcomes, including progression-free survival and overall survival (OS).  Results: PTEN loss and PIK3CA gain were detected in 37% (85 of 231) and 17% (39 of 231) of patients, respectively. Poorer outcomes were observed in patients with PTEN-PI3K-AKT pathway aberrations, including those with dual PTEN loss and PIK3CA gain (hazard ratio 2.3, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.4). Cumulative CNV burden in the PTEN-PI3K-AKT and androgen receptor (AR) pathways was associated with significantly worse clinical outcomes (0 v 1 v ≥ 2 CNVs in Australian cohort: median OS 33.5 v 17.2 v 9.7 months, P < .001; 0 v 1 v ≥ 2 CNVs in US cohort: median OS 35.5 v 14.3 v 9.2 months, P < .001). Notably, 21% (31 of 146) of PTEN-neutral patients harbored alternative PTEN-PI3K-AKT pathway aberrations.  Conclusion:   PTEN-PI3K-AKT pathway CNVs were readily detected using our cfDNA assay, with the prevalence of PTEN loss comparable with tissue-based studies. Additional PTEN-PI3K-AKT pathway aberrations were found in one fifth of PTEN-neutral cases.

National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines encouraging germline testing in metastatic PC were recently expanded to include all men with high-risk, very high-risk, or regional PC. Our aim was to assess the impact of expanded NCCN guidelines on the detection rate of germline PVs and to determine patient-level factors associated with a PV germline testing result.  Patients and methods:   Men with PC underwent multigene germline genetic testing for PVs from June 2016 to December 2018, and trends were compared. The association of patient-level factors with a PV germline testing result, where ≥ 1 PV was identified, was assessed using analysis of variance and univariate logistic regression. Sensitivity analyses were limited to clinically actionable variants and those associated with disease severity or progression (BRCA1/2 and ATM).  Results:   Of 408 men undergoing germline testing, 42 (10.3%) men had PVs and 366 (89.7%) men did not have PVs identified. The proportion of men identified with a germline PV remained stable following testing criteria expansion (9.4% v 10.6%, P = .73). No patient-level factors were significantly associated with increased odds of a PV germline testing result, including age at diagnosis, race, pretreatment prostate-specific antigen, Gleason grade group, NCCN risk group, and family history of cancer (breast and/or ovarian, prostate, or any cancer).  Conclusion:   This study demonstrated a stable PV detection rate in men with PC using expanded criteria aligned to the updated NCCN testing guidelines. However, we did not find strong evidence to suggest that patient-level factors are associated with PV germline testing results.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether circulating tumor DNA can detect genomic alterations present in multiple regions of localized prostate tumor tissue.  Methods:   Low-pass whole-genome and targeted sequencing with a machine-learning guided 2.5-Mb targeted panel were used to identify single nucleotide variants, small insertions and deletions (indels), and copy-number alterations in cfDNA. The majority of this study focuses on the subset of 21 patients with localized disease, although 45 total individuals were evaluated, including 15 healthy controls and nine men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Plasma cfDNA was barcoded with duplex unique molecular identifiers. For localized cases, matched tumor tissue was collected from multiple regions (one to nine samples per patient) for comparison.  Results:   Somatic tumor variants present in heterogeneous tumor foci from patients with localized disease were detected in cfDNA, and cfDNA mutational burden was found to track with disease severity. Somatic tissue alterations were identified in cfDNA, including nonsynonymous variants in FOXA1, PTEN, MED12, and ATM.

Secondary endpoints were biodistribution, tumour targeting and pharmacokinetic analysis.  Methods:   Four cohorts of three patients (9 with advanced prostate cancer, 2 with pancreatic and 1 with bladder cancer) were dosed with 1 mg, ~250 MBq of [67Ga]Ga-DOTA-Miltuximab®. Cohort 1 received [67Ga]Ga-DOTA-Miltuximab® alone, while cohorts 2-4 were pre-infused with increasing doses (3.5, 11.5 and 24 mg, respectively) of unlabelled Miltuximab®-DOTA 1 hour prior to [67Ga]Ga-DOTA-Miltuximab®. Safety and tolerability were assessed by clinical and standard laboratory assessments. Patients underwent whole body gamma-camera scans and SPECT/CT scans up to 144 h post-infusion. Total organ radiation exposure was determined by dosimetry of whole-body gamma scans.  Results:   The dosing regimen was well tolerated, with no drug-related adverse events observed. Liver and spleen uptake of [67Ga]Ga-DOTA-Miltuximab® was observed. Liver uptake was reduced by pre-infusion of unlabelled Miltuximab®-DOTA. Dosimetry analysis showed a favorable exposure profile. [67Ga]Ga-DOTA-Miltuximab® targeting to tumour sites was observed in two prostate cancer patients who had failed enzalutamide treatment. Higher doses of unlabelled antibody achieved lower liver uptake and increased antibody serum half life.  Conclusions:   This study is the first in human for Miltuximab® a first in class antibody targeting GPC-1.

In the present work, two novel lapachol-containing ruthenium(II) complexes [Ru(Lap)(dppm)(bipy)]PF6 (1) and [Ru(Lap)(dppm)(phen)]PF6 (2) [Lap = lapachol, dppm = 1,1'-bis(diphosphino)methane, bipy = 2,2'-bipyridine, phen = 1,10-phenantroline] were synthesized, fully characterized, and investigated for their cellular and molecular responses on cancer cell lines. We found that both complexes exhibited a potent cytotoxic effect in a panel of cancer cell lines in monolayer cultures, as well as in a 3D model of multicellular spheroids formed from DU-145 human prostate adenocarcinoma cells. Furthermore, the complex (2) suppressed the colony formation, induced G2/M-phase arrest, and downregulated Aurora-B. The mechanism studies suggest that complex (2) stimulate the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and triggers caspase-dependent apoptosis as a result of changes in expression of several genes related to cell proliferation and caspase-3 and -9 activation. Interestingly, we found that N-acetyl-L-cysteine, a ROS scavenger, suppressed the generation of intracellular ROS induced by complex (2), and decreased its cytotoxicity, indicating that ROS-mediated DNA damage leads the DU-145 cells into apoptosis. Overall, we highlighted that coordination of lapachol to phosphinic ruthenium(II) compounds considerably improves the antiproliferative activities of resulting complexes granting attractive selectivity to human prostate adenocarcinoma cells. The DNA damage response to ROS seems to be involved in the induction of caspase-mediated cell death that plays an important role in the complexes' cytotoxicity.

Our nomogram-the Stanford Prostate Cancer Calculator (SPCC)-combined these factors in a logistic regression to provide stronger predictive accuracy than PSA density or PIRADS alone. Validation of the SPCC using data from Yale and UAB yielded robust AUC values.

Androgen depriving therapies (ADTs) are a mainstay in metastatic prostate cancer, and salvage pelvic radiotherapy may offer long ADT-free intervals for patients harboring regional nodal relapses.  Objective:   To assess the efficacy of the combination of ADT and salvage radiotherapy in men with oligorecurrent pelvic node relapses of prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   We performed an open-label, phase II trial of combined high-dose intensity-modulated radiotherapy and ADT (6 mo) in oligorecurrent (five or fewer) pelvic node relapses in prostate cancer, detected by fluorocholine positron-emission tomography computed tomography imaging.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary endpoint was 2-yr progression-free survival defined as two consecutive prostate-specific antigen levels above the level at inclusion and/or clinical evidence of progression as per RECIST 1.1 and/or death from any cause.  Results and limitations:   Between August 2014 and July 2016, 67 patients were recruited in 15 centers. Half of the patients had received prior prostatic irradiation. The median age was 67.7 yr. After a median follow-up of 49.4 mo, 2- and 3-yr progression-free survival rates were 81% and 58%, respectively. Median progression-free survival was 45.3 mo. The median biochemical relapse-free survival (BRFS) was 25.9 mo. At 2 and 3 yr, the BRFS rates were 58% and 46%, respectively. Grade 2 + 2-yr genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicities were 10% and 2%, respectively.  Conclusions:   Combined high-dose salvage pelvic radiotherapy and ADT appeared to prolong tumor control in oligorecurrent pelvic node relapses in prostate cancer with limited toxicity.

Our previous study demonstrated that a CD44+ subpopulation isolated from PCa cells or tumours possesses both stem cell properties and metastatic potential, serving as metastatic prostate cancer stem cells (mPCSCs) in PCa metastasis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown.  Methods:   In this study, we established PCa models via the orthotopic and subcutaneous implantation of different human PCa cancer cell lines, and compared the metastatic efficacy, after which process function analysis of target genes was pinpointed.  Results:   Several novel differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between orthotopic and ectopic tumours were identified. Among them, human homeobox B9 (HOXB9) transcription factor was found to be essential for PCa metastasis, as evidenced by the diminished number of lung metastatic foci derived from orthotopic implantation with HOXB9-deficient CWR22 cells, compared with the control. In addition, HOXB9 protein expression was upregulated in PCa tissues, compared with paracancer and benign prostate hyperplasia tissues. It was also positively correlated with Gleason scores. Gain- and loss-of-function assays showed that HOXB9 altered the expression of various tumour metastasis- and cancer stem cell (CSC) growth-related genes in a transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ)-dependent manner. Moreover, HOXB9 was overexpressed in an ALDH+CD44+CXCR4+CD24+ subpopulation of PCa cells that exhibited enhanced TGFβ-dependent tumorigenic and metastatic abilities, compared with other isogenic PCa cells. This suggests that HOXB9 may contribute to PCa tumorigenesis and metastasis via TGFβ signalling. Of note, ALDH+CD44+CXCR4+CD24+-PCa cells exhibited resistance to castration and antiandrogen therapy and were present in human PCa tissues.  Conclusion:   Taken together, our study identified HOXB9 as a critical regulator of metastatic mPCSC behaviour. This occurs through altering the expression of a panel of CSC growth- and invasion/metastasis-related genes via TGFβ signalling. Thus, targeting HOXB9 is a potential novel therapeutic PCa treatment strategy.""","""['Yi Sui#', 'Wei Hu#', 'Wei Zhang#', 'Dejian Li', 'Hongbo Zhu', 'Qinghua You', 'Rujian Zhu', 'Qingtong Yi', 'Tao Tang', 'Lili Gao', 'Shengjuan Zhu', 'Tao Yang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Infiltrating bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells increase prostate cancer stem cell population and metastatic ability via secreting cytokines to suppress androgen receptor signaling.', 'HOXB9 enhances the ability of lung cancer cells to penetrate the blood-brain barrier.', 'HN1L promotes stem cell-like properties by regulating TGF-β signaling pathway through targeting FOXP2 in prostate cancer.', 'Cancer stem cell and mesenchymal cell cooperative actions in metastasis progression and hormone resistance in prostate cancer: Potential role of androgen and gonadotropin‑releasing hormone receptors (Review).', 'Androgen receptor and prostate cancer stem cells: biological mechanisms and clinical implications.', 'Associations between Body Mass Index and Prostate Cancer: The Impact on Progression-Free Survival.', 'Targeting aldehyde dehydrogenase for prostate cancer therapies.', 'Homeobox B9 Promotes the Progression of Hepatocellular Carcinoma via TGF-β1/Smad and ERK1/2 Signaling Pathways.']"""

Objective:   This study compares multiple means of PV estimation, including digital rectal examination (DRE), transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and radical prostatectomy specimens to determine the best volume measurement style.  Methods:   A retrospective, observational, single-site study with patients identified using an institutional database was performed. A total of 197 patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy were considered. Data collected included age, serum PSA at the time of the prostate biopsy, clinical T stage, Gleason score, and PVs for each of the following methods: DRE, TRUS, MRI, and surgical specimen weight (SPW) and volume.  Results:   A paired t test was performed, which reported a statistically significant difference between PV measures (DRE, TRUS, MRI ellipsoid, MRI bullet, SP ellipsoid, and SP bullet) and the actual prostate weight. Lowest differences were reported for SP ellipsoid volume (M = -2.37; standard deviation [SD] = 10.227; t[167] = -3.011; and p = 0.003), MRI ellipsoid volume (M = -4.318; SD = 9.53; t[167] = -5.87; and p = 0.000), and MRI bullet volume (M = 5.31; SD = 10.77; t[167] = 6.387; and p = 0.000).  Conclusion:   The PV obtained by MRI has proven to correlate with the PV obtained via auto-segmentation software as well as actual SPW, while also being more cost-effective and time-efficient.

Machine Learning (ML) methods are widely used in the areas of risk prediction and classification. The primary objective of such algorithms is to use several features to predict dichotomous responses (e.g., disease positive/negative). Similar to statistical inference modelling, ML modelling is subject to the class imbalance problem and is affected by the majority class, increasing the false-negative rate. In this study, seventy-nine ML models were built and evaluated to classify approximately 2000 participants from 26 hospitals in eight different countries into two groups of radiotherapy (RT) side effects incidence based on recorded observations from the international study of RT related toxicity ""REQUITE"". We also examined the effect of sampling techniques and cost-sensitive learning methods on the models when dealing with class imbalance. The combinations of such techniques used had a significant impact on the classification. They resulted in an improvement in incidence status prediction by shifting classifiers' attention to the minority group. The best classification model for RT acute toxicity prediction was identified based on domain experts' success criteria. The Area Under Receiver Operator Characteristic curve of the models tested with an isolated dataset ranged from 0.50 to 0.77. The scale of improved results is promising and will guide further development of models to predict RT acute toxicities. One model was optimised and found to be beneficial to identify patients who are at risk of developing acute RT early-stage toxicities as a result of undergoing breast RT ensuring relevant treatment interventions can be appropriately targeted. The design of the approach presented in this paper resulted in producing a preclinical-valid prediction model.

In this work, we introduce a novel patient-level classification framework, denoted PCF, that is trained using patient-level labels only. In PCF, features are extracted from three-dimensional mpMRI and derived parameter maps using convolutional neural networks and subsequently, combined with clinical features by a multi-classifier support vector machine scheme. The output of PCF is a probability value that indicates whether a patient is harboring clinically significant PCa (Gleason score ≥3+4) or not. PCF achieved mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.79 and 0.86 on the PICTURE and PROSTATEx datasets respectively, using five-fold cross-validation.

Objective:   To compare oncological and functional outcomes of a new technique of clipless, lateral pedicle control and PLND with RARP with bipolar energy (RARP-bi) versus the standard RARP technique with clips (RARP-c).  Design, setting, and participants:   A retrospective study was conducted among 338 men who underwent RARP between July 2018 and March 2020.  Surgical procedure:   RARP-c versus RARP-bi.  Measurements:   We prospectively collected data and retrospectively compared demographic, clinicopathological, and functional outcome data. Urinary as well as sexual function was assessed using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index for Clinical Practice, and complications were assessed using Clavien-Dindo grading. Multivariable regression modeling was used to examine whether the technical approach of RARP-bi versus RARP-c was associated with positive surgical margins (PSMs) or sexual and urinary function scores.  Results and limitations:   A total of 144 (43%) and 194 (57%) men underwent RARP-bi and RARP-c, respectively. Overall, there were no differences in functional and oncological outcomes between the two approaches. On multivariable regression analysis, the RARP-bi technique was not associated with significant differences in PSMs (odds ratio [OR] = 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6-1.8; p = 0.9), sexual function (OR = 0.4, 95% CI 0.1-1.5; p = 0.8), or urinary function (OR = 0.5, 95% CI 0.2-1.4; p = 0.2). The overall 30-d complication rates (12% vs 16%, p = 0.5) and bladder neck contracture rates (2.1% vs 3.6%, p = 0.5) were similar between the two groups. There was no difference in lymphocele complications (1.4% vs 0.52%, p = 0.58). All complications were of Clavien-Dindo grade I-II.  Conclusions:   Despite the concerns for an increased risk of nerve injury secondary to the use of bipolar energy for prostatic pedicle dissection, we demonstrate that this technique is oncologically and functionally similar to the standard approach with surgical clips. There was no difference in complications or lymphocele formation for techniques with versus without clips.  Patient summary:   We describe a modified technique for prostatic pedicle dissection during robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy, which utilizes bipolar energy and is associated with shorter operative time, without compromising functional or oncological outcomes.""","""['Spyridon P Basourakos', 'Alec Zhu', 'Patrick J Lewicki', 'Ashwin Ramaswamy', 'Emily Cheng', 'Vanessa Dudley', 'Miko Yu', 'Beerinder Karir', 'Andrew J Hung', 'Francesca Khani', 'Jim C Hu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Urological Oncology: Prostate Cancer.', 'Retzius-sparing Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Leads to Durable Improvement in Urinary Function and Quality of Life Versus Standard Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Without Compromise on Oncologic Efficacy: Single-surgeon Series and Step-by-step Guide.', 'Outcomes of Salvage Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy After Focal Ablation for Prostate Cancer in Comparison to Primary Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: A Matched Analysis.', 'Effect of Peritoneal Fixation (PerFix) on Lymphocele Formation in Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy with Pelvic Lymphadenectomy: Results of a Randomized Prospective Trial.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Retzius Sparing Radical Prostatectomy Versus Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Which Technique Is More Beneficial for Prostate Cancer Patients (MASTER Study)?

Dual pathway inhibition with AKT inhibitor ipatasertib plus abiraterone might have greater benefit than abiraterone alone. We aimed to compare ipatasertib plus abiraterone with placebo plus abiraterone in patients with previously untreated mCRPC with or without tumour PTEN loss.  Methods:   We did a randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial at 200 sites across 26 countries or regions. Patients aged 18 years or older with previously untreated asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic mCRPC who had progressive disease and Eastern Collaborative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 were randomly assigned (1:1; permuted block method) to receive ipatasertib (400 mg once daily orally) plus abiraterone (1000 mg once daily orally) and prednisolone (5 mg twice a day orally) or placebo plus abiraterone and prednisolone (with the same dosing schedule). Patients received study treatment until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal from the study, or study completion. Stratification factors were previous taxane-based therapy for hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, type of progression, presence of visceral metastasis, and tumour PTEN-loss status by immunohistochemistry. Patients, investigators, and the study sponsor were masked to the treatment allocation. The coprimary endpoints were investigator-assessed radiographical progression-free survival in the PTEN-loss-by-immunohistochemistry population and in the intention-to-treat population. This study is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03072238.  Findings:   Between June 30, 2017, and Jan 17, 2019, 1611 patients were screened for eligibility and 1101 (68%) were enrolled; 554 (50%) were assigned to the placebo-abiraterone group and 547 (50%) to the ipatasertib-abiraterone group. At data cutoff (March 16, 2020), median follow-up duration was 19 months (range 0-33). In the 521 (47%) patients who had tumours with PTEN loss by immunohistochemistry (261 in the placebo-abiraterone group and 260 in the ipatasertib-abiraterone group), median radiographical progression-free survival was 16·5 months (95% CI 13·9-17·0) in the placebo-abiraterone group and 18·5 months (16·3-22·1) in the ipatasertib-abiraterone group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·77 [95% CI 0·61-0·98]; p=0·034; significant at α=0·04). In the intention-to-treat population, median progression-free survival was 16·6 months (95% CI 15·6-19·1) in the placebo-abiraterone group and 19·2 months (16·5-22·3) in the ipatasertib-abiraterone group (HR 0·84 [95% CI 0·71-0·99]; p=0·043; not significant at α=0·01). Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurred in 213 (39%) of 546 patients in the placebo-abiraterone group and in 386 (70%) of 551 patients in the ipatasertib-abiraterone group; adverse events leading to discontinuation of placebo or ipatasertib occurred in 28 (5%) in the placebo-abiraterone group and 116 (21%) in the ipatasertib-abiraterone group. Deaths due to adverse events deemed related to treatment occurred in two patients (<1%; acute myocardial infarction [n=1] and lower respiratory tract infection [n=1]) in the placebo-abiraterone group and in two patients (<1%; hyperglycaemia [n=1] and chemical pneumonitis [n=1]) in the ipastasertb-abiraterone group.  Interpretation:   Ipatasertib plus abiraterone significantly improved radiographical progression-free survival compared with placebo plus abiraterone among patients with mCRPC with PTEN-loss tumours, but there was no significant difference between the groups in the intention-to-treat population. Adverse events were consistent with the known safety profiles of each agent. These data suggest that combined AKT and androgen-receptor signalling pathway inhibition with ipatasertib and abiraterone is a potential treatment for men with PTEN-loss mCRPC, a population with a poor prognosis.

Predictors of outcomes after 177Lu-PSMA to enhance its clinical implementation are yet to be identified. We aimed to develop nomograms to predict outcomes after 177Lu-PSMA in patients with mCRPC.  Methods:   In this multicentre, retrospective study, we screened patients with mCRPC who had received 177Lu-PSMA between Dec 10, 2014, and July 19, 2019, as part of the previous phase 2 trials (NCT03042312, ACTRN12615000912583) or compassionate access programmes at six hospitals and academic centres in Germany, the USA, and Australia. Eligible patients had received intravenous 6·0-8·5 GBq 177Lu-PSMA once every 6-8 weeks, for a maximum of four to six cycles, and had available baseline [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan, clinical data, and survival outcomes. Putative predictors included 18 pretherapeutic clinicopathological and [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT variables. Data were collected locally and centralised. Primary outcomes for the nomograms were overall survival and prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-progression-free survival. Nomograms for each outcome were computed from Cox regression models with LASSO penalty for variable selection. Model performance was measured by examining discrimination (Harrell's C-index), calibration (calibration plots), and utility (patient stratification into low-risk vs high-risk groups). Models were validated internally using bootstrapping and externally by calculating their performance on a validation cohort.  Findings:   Between April 23, 2019, and Jan 13, 2020, 414 patients were screened; 270 (65%) of whom were eligible and were divided into development (n=196) and validation (n=74) cohorts. The median duration of follow-up was 21·5 months (IQR 13·3-30·7). Predictors included in the nomograms were time since initial diagnosis of prostate cancer, chemotherapy status, baseline haemoglobin concentration, and [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT parameters (molecular imaging TNM classification and tumour burden). The C-index of the overall survival model was 0·71 (95% CI 0·69-0·73). Similar C-indices were achieved at internal validation (0·71 [0·69-0·73]) and external validation (0·72 [0·68-0·76]). The C-index of the PSA-progression-free survival model was 0·70 (95% CI 0·68-0·72). Similar C-indices were achieved at internal validation (0·70 [0·68-0·72]) and external validation (0·71 [0·68-0·74]). Both models were adequately calibrated and their predictions correlated with the observed outcome. Compared with high-risk patients, low-risk patients had significantly longer overall survival in the validation cohort (24·9 months [95% CI 16·8-27·3] vs 7·4 months [4·0-10·8]; p<0·0001) and PSA-progression-free survival (6·6 months [6·0-7·1] vs 2·5 months [1·2-3·8]; p=0·022).  Interpretation:   These externally validated nomograms that are predictive of outcomes after 177Lu-PSMA in patients with mCRPC might help in clinical trial design and individual clinical decision making, particularly at institutions where 177Lu-PSMA is introduced as a novel therapeutic option.

Likewise, its effect on human colon normal cells (CCD-841 CoN) and human normal fibroblast cells (HFF-1) was studied. The cytostatic activity of Oxy was also compared with that of the reference cytostatic drugs used in chemotherapy protocols, namely carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, epirubicin, etoposide, flutamide, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin and sorafenib. In all cell lines tested, Oxy proved to be more powerful cytostatic than Exe. Additionally, the IC50 at 72 h showed a three-fold activity greater than 5-fluorouracil in the WiDr cell line, twice as high as cisplatin for cell line A549 and five times higher than cisplatin for cell line H1299. Also, Oxy surprisingly revealed to induce DNA damage and inhibit the DNA damage response (DDR) proteins ATM, ATR, CHK1 and CHK2. The results obtained allow concluding that Oxy can be a promising anticancer agent to be used in chemotherapy protocols.

Combining informatics with in vivo and in vitro gain- and loss-of-function studies across multiple murine and human tumor types, we show that opposite pro- or anti-cancer YAP activity functionally defines binary YAPon or YAPoff cancer classes that express or silence YAP, respectively. YAPoff solid cancers are neural/neuroendocrine and frequently RB1-/-, such as retinoblastoma, small cell lung cancer, and neuroendocrine prostate cancer. YAP silencing is intrinsic to the cell of origin, or acquired with lineage switching and drug resistance. The binary cancer groups exhibit distinct YAP-dependent adhesive behavior and pharmaceutical vulnerabilities, underscoring clinical relevance. Mechanistically, distinct YAP/TEAD enhancers in YAPoff or YAPon cancers deploy anti-cancer integrin or pro-cancer proliferative programs, respectively.

Methods:   From 01/2011 to 12/2014, 195 consecutive RCC patients with a preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 60 ml/min/1.73m2 underwent surgical RCC treatment with either PN or RN. Logistic and linear regression models tested for the effect of CysC as a predictor of new-onset chronic kidney disease in follow-up (eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2). Moreover, postoperative CysC and creatinine values were compared for kidney function estimation.  Results:   Of 195 patients, 129 (66.2%) underwent PN. In postoperative and in follow-up setting (median 14 months, IQR 10-20), rates of eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2 were 55.9 and 30.2%. In multivariable logistic regression models, preoperative CysC [odds ratio (OR): 18.3] and RN (OR: 13.5) were independent predictors for a reduced eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2 in follow-up (both p < 0.01), while creatinine was not. In multivariable linear regression models, a difference of the preoperative CysC level of 0.1 mg/dl estimated an eGFR decline in follow-up of about 5.8 ml/min/1.73m2. Finally, we observed a plateau of postoperative creatinine values in the range of 1.2-1.3 mg/dl, when graphically depicted vs. postoperative CysC values ('creatinine blind area').  Conclusion:   Preoperative CysC predicts renal function impairment following RCC surgery.

Following a previously published analysis of immune changes during and after curative radiotherapy for prostate cancer, this analysis focused on describing correlations of changes of immune cell subsets with radiation treatment parameters.  Patients and methods:   For 13 patients treated in a prospective trial with radiotherapy to the prostate region (primary analysis) and five patients treated with radiotherapy to prostate and pelvic nodal regions (exploratory analysis), already published immune monitoring data were correlated with clinical data as well as radiation planning parameters such as clinical target volume (CTV) and volumes receiving 20 Gy (V20) for newly contoured volumes of pelvic blood vessels and bone marrow.  Results:   Most significant changes among immune cell subsets were observed at the end of radiotherapy. In contrast, correlations of age and CD8+ subsets (effector and memory cells) were observed early during and 3 months after radiotherapy. Ratios of T cells and T cell proliferation compared to baseline correlated with CTV. Early changes in regulatory T cells (Treg cells) and CD8+ effector T cells correlated with V20 of blood vessels and bone volumes.  Conclusions:   Patient age as well as radiotherapy planning parameters correlated with immune changes during radiotherapy. Larger irradiated volumes seem to correlate with early suppression of anti-cancer immunity. For immune cell analysis during normofractionated radiotherapy and correlations with treatment planning parameters, different time points should be looked at in future projects.

Subjects and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed eight patients with bladder cancer who underwent intravesical BCG therapy after transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBt) cancer. All these eight patients received 12-core transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate systemic biopsies. Clinical data on PSA with T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T2WI, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) on mpMRI were enrolled in the study. H and E and acid-fast staining was performed to pathologically prove GP.  Results:   Four of all eight cases were above 4 ng/ml total PSA (tPSA) levels and four cases were within normal ranges, while free PSA/tPSA levels decreased to lower than 16% in all patients. Every patient had hard prostatic nodules through digital rectal examination (DRE). All characters of prostate mpMRI did not show signal intensity (SI) of prostate cancer before BCG therapy but showed abnormal signals after BCG therapy. All nodular lesions showed equal SI on T1WI, lower SI on T2WI, higher SI on DWI, and lower SI on ADC after BCG therapy. Pathologic results were GP and acid-fast staining outcomes were positive in all biopsies.  Conclusions:   Perioperative serum PSA levels, prostate magnetic resonance imaging, and DRE may help in the diagnosis of GP induced by intravesical BCG therapy.

The application of ultra-hypofractionated regimens (ultra-HypoAR), with fraction size above 5 Gy, is also widely tested.  Methods:   We applied Image Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT) ultra-HypoAR delivered with Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) technique in low-risk prostate cancer patients (5.75 Gy/fraction, 40.25 Gy total dose, two fractions per week). A comparative radiobiological analysis of Dose-Volume Ηistograms (DVH) obtained for target volumes and organs at risk was performed, investigating the advantages and disadvantages of ultra-HypoAR and conventional radiotherapy regimens (CRT). Early clinical results on efficacy and toxicity are also reported.  Results:   We calculated the Normalized Total Dose (NTD) and NTD with time correction (NTD_T)-based biological Dose- Volume Histograms (bDVH) for bladder and rectum tissue late effects (α/β=4 Gy) and early effects (α/β=10 Gy). Ultra-HypoAR produced a significantly lower biological dose burden than CRT, for both early and late responding tissue components of the bladder and rectum, whether calculated for time-correction or not (p<0.0001). Our clinical experience showed that the ultra-HypoAR regimen produced minimal early and late radiation sequelae. The median PSA levels dropped from 9.1 to 0.75 and 0.45 ng/ml at 6 and 12 months, respectively, after the end of therapy.

Semi-structured interviews are characterized by a set of pre-defined questions and developed ad hoc by researchers in Leicester within the REQUITE project. The interview questions investigated interest in undergoing the genetic test and expectations on its usefulness and disadvantages.  Results:   Eighteen interviews were conducted and analysed. Forty-five initial codes were combined into nine themes which were then clustered in two main macro-areas (i) Opportunities and (ii) Challenges. Overall, all patients understand the aim of the genetic test and considered its intrinsic opportunity to make the physician more confident with the treatment. Regarding side effects, most of patients felt prepared to RT but not without fear. Many women considered important to have the largest and reliable information, also about negative experiences. Prevailing emotions were anxiety and fear but not connected to genetic test's result.

Total cancer mortality is predicted to decline in all countries considered for both sexes, with the exception of Argentinian women. The lowest total mortality rates were predicted in Mexico (65.4/100 000 men and 62.3 in women), the highest ones were in Cuba (133.3/100 000 men and 91.0 in women). Stomach cancer rates have been decreasing since 1970 in all countries; colorectal cancer started to decline over recent calendar periods. Rates for this cancer were unfavourable in the youngest age group. Lung cancer trends declined in males and remained comparatively low in all countries except Cuba. In Cuba, lung cancer rates in women overtook those for breast. Mortality from cancers of the breast, (cervix) uterus, ovary, prostate and bladder, as well as leukemia mostly showed favourable trends. A marked variability in rates across Latin American countries persists, and rates were relatively high for stomach, uterus, prostate and lung cancers, as compared to Europe and North America, suggesting the need to improve preventive strategies.

Cytogenetic tests were conducted on 2396 healthy Hungarian individuals and cancer incidence was followed up from 1989 to 2018. Venous blood samples were obtained from the subjects and metaphases from lymphocyte cultures were prepared. We compared the CA frequencies of the various smoking (1-5; 6-10; 11-19; or 20-40 cigarettes/day) and exposure (irradiation; chemical industry; chemical research laboratory) groups. Chromatid break (p = 0.0002), total aberration (p = 0.002), and aberrant cell (p = 0.001) frequencies were higher in smokers than in non-smokers. For very heavy smokers, total CAs were significantly higher than for non-smokers (<0.001) or less intensive smokers (p = 0.003-0.0006). Intensity of smoking was a predictor of chromosomal aberrations, while duration was not. During follow-up, 177 (7.3 %) cancer cases were found. A Cox-regression model showed that subjects with cell values ≥2 CAs developed cancer more frequently (hazard ratio = 1.39; 95 % CI, 1.02-1.90). The relative risks of cancer were 1.06 (95 % CI 0.53-2.06) for light smokers and 1.74 (95 % CI 1.08-2.77) for very heavy smokers. The distributions of cancer sites showed differences between smoker and non-smoker groups: in male smokers, lung cancer, in non-smokers, prostate, and in females (both groups) breast cancer were most common.

The aim of this study was to explore partner experiences of prostate cancer patients' engagement with a community-based football program.  Methods:   Eight audio-visual recorded semi-structured focus group interviews were conducted with a total of 39 female partners of men with prostate cancer who participated in a community-based football program as part of the nationwide FC Prostate Community Trial (NCT02430792). Data was managed with the software program Nvivo 11 and analysed inductively to derive thematic findings.  Results:   The four thematic findings were: 1) 'Hope of a new beginning' which included stories of hope that football would mitigate the negative effects of men's prostate cancer treatment [s]; 2) 'My new partner' was characterized by attributing connections between physical activity and elevated mood as a by-product of men's involvement in the program; 3) 'Football first' included assertions of the couples mutual commitment to the football program; and 4) 'Invisible needs' contrasted insecurity, and unforeseen challenges for partners feeling somewhat neglected. Overall, the results confirm the need for cohesion and flexibility amongst couple-dyads to ensure partners and men with prostate cancer benefit from their involvement in football programs.  Conclusions:   This study indicates that partners of prostate cancer survivors' engaging with community-based football align to idealized gender relations, roles and identities.

An efficient splicing of primary transcripts is an essential step in gene expression and its misregulation is related to numerous human diseases. Thus, to better understand the dynamics of this process and the perturbations that might be caused by aberrant transcript processing it is important to quantify splicing efficiency.  Results:   Here, we introduce SPLICE-q, a fast and user-friendly Python tool for genome-wide SPLICing Efficiency quantification. It supports studies focusing on the implications of splicing efficiency in transcript processing dynamics. SPLICE-q uses aligned reads from strand-specific RNA-seq to quantify splicing efficiency for each intron individually and allows the user to select different levels of restrictiveness concerning the introns' overlap with other genomic elements such as exons of other genes. We applied SPLICE-q to globally assess the dynamics of intron excision in yeast and human nascent RNA-seq. We also show its application using total RNA-seq from a patient-matched prostate cancer sample.  Conclusions:   Our analyses illustrate that SPLICE-q is suitable to detect a progressive increase of splicing efficiency throughout a time course of nascent RNA-seq and it might be useful when it comes to understanding cancer progression beyond mere gene expression levels.

As numerous studies have shown that IDCP is associated with high stage disease with a significant negative impact on cancer-specific survival, accurate diagnosis is crucial to ensure appropriate patient management. The definition of IDCP recommended by 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification suggests that cases of IDCP with micropapillary or loose cribriform architecture without comedonecrosis should have cells with ≥6× nuclear enlargement. It is unclear how this size criterion was derived and which of the parameters of nuclear size (nuclear diameter, nuclear surface area, or nuclear perimeter) it relates to. To evaluate the extent of nuclear enlargement in IDCP, we performed morphometric analyses relating to each of these parameters in 100 radical prostatectomy specimens. One hundred nuclei from foci of IDCP and 50 nuclei from foci of normal luminal epithelium were examined for each patient. Diagnosis of IDCP was based on cells with definite features of carcinoma present within duct/acinar structures. Comparing the means of each of the parameters between IDCP cells and benign luminal cells, there was a statistically significant enlargement in nuclear perimeter (P<0.0005), nuclear area (P<0.0005), and nuclear diameter (P<0.0005); however, the difference in mean nuclear size was limited to factors of 1.3×, 1.6×, and 1.3×, respectively. Three patients each had rare large nuclei (largest perimeter 45, 45, and 44 μm; maximum nuclear area 135, 136, and 136 μm2; and the largest diameter 18 µm in each). For these rare cells, the nuclear size difference, when compared with benign nuclei was; nuclear perimeter 2.0×, 2.1×, and 2.1×; nuclear area 3.6×, 3.8×, and 3.8×; and nuclear maximum diameter 3.0×, 2.5×, and 2.5×. The definition of nuclear enlargement of ≥6× was not reached in any of our cases, all of which clearly showed features of duct invasive carcinoma. In these cases, reliance on nuclear size criteria would have resulted in underdiagnosis of IDCP. This is of concern as failure to recognize IDCP, particularly in needle biopsies, could lead to delays in the timely treatment of aggressive high-grade prostate cancer, resulting in cancer progression and suboptimal patient oncological outcomes.""","""['Hemamali Samaratunga', 'Brett Delahunt', 'John W Yaxley', 'Shulammite Johannsen', 'Lars Egevad']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate: Extreme Nuclear Size Is Not a Diagnostic Parameter.', 'In Reply: Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate and Nuclear Size.', 'Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate: a critical re-appraisal.', 'Intraductal Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate With Cribriform or Papillary Ductal Morphology: Rare Biopsy Cases Lacking Associated Invasive High-grade Carcinoma.', 'Isolated Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate in Prostatectomy Specimens: Report of 2 Cases and Review of the Literature.', 'Grading of prostate cancer: the impact of including intraductal carcinoma on the overall Grade Group assigned in diagnostic biopsies.', 'Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate on needle biopsy: Histologic features and clinical significance.', 'Fiber Bundle Image Reconstruction Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Bundle Rotation in Endomicroscopy.', 'Cribriform Patterned Lesions in the Prostate Gland with Emphasis on Differential Diagnosis and Clinical Significance.', 'Contemporary Grading of Prostate Cancer: The Impact of Grading Criteria and the Significance of the Amount of Intraductal Carcinoma.']"""

This study explored a novel technique to improve the MV imaging based fiducial visibility for a cohort of prostate radiotherapy patients, without compromising the original treatment plan. The study also compared these results to visibility using single MLC control points, as well as short arcs.Methods. Geometric data from 68 prostate radiotherapy treatments, each with implanted gold fiducials, was retrospectively analysed. Fiducials were contoured for each patient, and conventional and SBRT treatment plans were generated using a VMAT technique. Using an in-house script, fiducial contours were projected onto the VMAT MLC control points. Resulting data was assessed to determine whether the fiducial contours were theoretically visible for single MLC control points and groups of MLC control points (short arcs), both being surrogates for intra-fraction MV imaging. Using this data, a theoretical quadrant technique was investigated that assessed the region surrounding each fiducial to determine if visualisation would theoretically improve.Results. Using a conventional treatment type, mean fiducial visibility for single MLC control points across the patient cohort ranged from 2.5% up to 17.8%. For SBRT, fiducial visibility ranged from 1.8% up to 19.7%. For short arcs, fiducial visibility for conventional treatment types ranged from 5.9% up to 20.7%. For SBRT, fiducial visibility ranged from 4.6% up to 23.1%. When the novel fiducial quadrant technique was used, theoretical visibility improved two-fold, from 22.7% up to 52.5% and from 24.7% up to 55.3% for conventional and SBRT treatment types respectively.Conclusions.

In prostate cancer tissues and cell lines, levels of UHRF1 and CDC6 were simultaneously upregulated, and this was associated with worse survival. UHRF1 silencing significantly promoted the cytotoxicity and anti-prostate cancer efficacy of bicalutamide in mouse xenografts by inhibiting CDC6 gene expression. UHRF1 promoted AR-regulated CDC6 transcription by binding to the CCAAT motif near the androgen response element (ARE) in the CDC6 promoter. We further found that UHRF1 promoted androgen-dependent chromatin occupancy of AR protein by recruiting the H3K9me2/3-specific demethyltransferase KDM4C and modifying the intense heterochromatin status. Altogether, we found for the first time that UHRF1 promotes AR-regulated CDC6 transcription through a novel chromatin modification mechanism and contributes to anti-AR drug resistance in prostate cancer.

The first high-field (1.5T) MR-Linac received regulatory approval in late 2018, and little is known about clinical use, patient tolerability of daily high-field MRI, and toxicity of treatments. Herein we report the initial experience within the MOMENTUM Study (NCT04075305), a prospective international registry of the MR-Linac Consortium.  Methods and materials:   Patients were included between February 2019 and October 2020 at 7 institutions in 4 countries. We used descriptive statistics to describe the patterns of care, tolerability (the percentage of patients discontinuing their course early), and safety (grade 3-5 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v.5 acute toxicity within 3 months after the end of treatment).  Results:   A total 943 patients participated in the MOMENTUM Study, 702 of whom had complete baseline data at the time of this analysis. Patients were primarily male (79%) with a median age of 68 years (range, 22-93) and were treated for 39 different indications. The most frequent indications were prostate (40%), oligometastatic lymph node (17%), brain (12%), and rectal (10%) cancers. The median number of fractions was 5 (range, 1-35). Six patients discontinued MR-Linac treatments, but none due to an inability to tolerate repeated high-field MRI. Of the 415 patients with complete data on acute toxicity at 3-month follow-up, 18 (4%) patients experienced grade 3 acute toxicity related to radiation.

The search for new treatment strategies against these types of cancer is thus of top current interest. In this context, salinomycin (SAL), a naturally occurring polyether ionophore, has been identified recently as a very promising anticancer drug candidate towards several tumour cells. In the present work, a broad library of 24 derivatives of C20-epi-salinomycin (2), including C1 singly, C20 singly and C1/C20 doubly modified analogue structures, was screened to identify compounds with improved activity against colon and prostate cancer cells. Our study demonstrated that the growth inhibitory potency of the parent compound on both primary and metastatic colon cancer cells was similar to that of the semisynthetic products derived from SAL, and simultaneously the SAL analogues showed more potent toxic action on metastatic prostate cancer cells than that of the chemically unmodified ionophore. In contrast to the widely used oncological drug doxorubicin, some of the SAL derivatives demonstrated promising anticancer activity with no toxic effects on non-tumour cells, and with more favourable cytotoxicity than that of a reference agent 5-fluorouracil. Mechanistically, the SAL analogues induced late apoptosis in colon cancer cells and necrosis in prostate cancer cells, as well as reduced secretion of interleukin 6 (IL-6) in these cells.""","""['Dominika Czerwonka', 'Magdalena Mielczarek-Puta', 'Michał Antoszczak', 'Aleksandra Cioch', 'Marta Struga', 'Adam Huczyński']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur J Pharmacol""","""['Singly and doubly modified analogues of C20-epi-salinomycin: A new group of antiparasitic agents against Trypanosoma brucei.', 'Activity of singly and doubly modified derivatives of C20-epi-salinomycin against Staphylococcus strains.', 'Synthesis and Anticancer Activity of Tertiary Amides of Salinomycin and Their C20-oxo Analogues.', 'Salinomycin and its derivatives - A new class of multiple-targeted ""magic bullets"".', 'A comprehensive review of salinomycin derivatives as potent anticancer and anti-CSCs agents.', 'Rapid Access to Ironomycin Derivatives by Click Chemistry.', 'Expeditive Synthesis of Potent C20-epi-Amino Derivatives of Salinomycin against Cancer Stem-Like Cells.']"""

Methods:   A three-step pipeline, comprising feature extraction, dose statistic prediction and dose mimicking, is employed. In particular, the features are produced by a convolutional variational autoencoder and used as inputs in a previously developed nonparametric Bayesian statistical method, estimating the multivariate predictive distribution of a collection of predefined dose statistics. Specially developed objective functions are then used to construct a probabilistic dose mimicking problem based on the produced distributions, creating deliverable treatment plans.  Results:   The numerical experiments are performed using a dataset of 94 retrospective treatment plans of prostate cancer patients. We show that the features extracted by the variational autoencoder capture geometric information of substantial relevance to the dose statistic prediction problem and are related to dose statistics in a more regularized fashion than hand-crafted features. The estimated predictive distributions are reasonable and outperforms a non-input-dependent benchmark method, and the deliverable plans produced by the probabilistic dose mimicking agree better with their clinical counterparts than for a non-probabilistic formulation.  Conclusions:   We demonstrate that prediction of dose-related quantities may be extended to include uncertainty estimation and that such probabilistic information may be leveraged in a dose mimicking problem. The treatment plans produced by the proposed pipeline resemble their original counterparts well, illustrating the merits of a holistic approach to automated planning based on probabilistic modeling.""","""['Tianfang Zhang', 'Rasmus Bokrantz', 'Jimmy Olsson']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Robust automated radiation therapy treatment planning using scenario-specific dose prediction and robust dose mimicking.', 'Probabilistic Pareto plan generation for semiautomated multicriteria radiation therapy treatment planning.', 'Probabilistic dose prediction using mixture density networks for automated radiation therapy treatment planning.', 'Fully automated treatment planning for head and neck radiotherapy using a voxel-based dose prediction and dose mimicking method.', 'Coverage optimized planning: probabilistic treatment planning based on dose coverage histogram criteria.', 'Robust automated radiation therapy treatment planning using scenario-specific dose prediction and robust dose mimicking.']"""

We sought to establish rates of adverse pathological features important for radiation planning by analyzing surgical specimens from men with intermediate risk prostate cancer who underwent immediate radical prostatectomy, and to define clinical pathologic features that may predict adverse outcomes.  Materials and methods:   A total of 1552 men diagnosed with intermediate risk prostate cancer who underwent immediate radical prostatectomy between 1/1/2005 and 12/31/2015 were reviewed. Inclusion criteria included available preoperative PSA level, pathology reports of transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy, and radical prostatectomy. Incidences of various pathological adverse features were evaluated. Patient characteristics and clinical disease features were analyzed for their predictive values.  Results:   Fifty percent of men with high risk features (defined as PSA >10 but <20 or biopsy primary Gleason pattern of 4) had pathological upstage to T3 or higher disease. The incidence of upgrade to Gleason score of 8 or higher and the incidence of lymph node positive disease was low. Biopsy primary Gleason pattern of 4, and PSA greater than 10 but less than 20, affected adverse pathology in addition to age and percent positive biopsy cores. Older age and increased percentage of positive cores were significant risk factors of adverse pathology.

We investigated the role of TXA2 in the development of lethal prostate cancer in African American (AA) and European American (EA) men.  Methods:   We measured urinary 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 (TXB2), a stable metabolite of TXA2, with mass spectrometry. Samples were obtained from 977 cases and 1022 controls at time of recruitment. We applied multivariable logistic and Cox regression modeling to examine associations of TXB2 with prostate cancer and patient survival. The median survival follow-up was 8.4 years, with 246 deaths among cases. Aspirin use was assessed with a questionnaire. Race was self-reported.  Results:   Urinary TXB2 was inversely associated with aspirin use. High (>median) TXB2 was associated with prostate cancer in AA (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.13 to 2.00) but not EA men (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.82 to 1.40), suggesting upregulated TXA2 synthesis in AA men with prostate cancer. High TXB2 was positively associated with metastatic prostate cancer (OR = 2.60, 95% CI = 1.08 to 6.28) compared with low (≤median) TXB2. Furthermore, high TXB2 was also associated with all-cause (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.06 to 2.40) and prostate cancer-specific mortality (hazard ratio = 4.74, 95% CI = 1.62 to 13.88) in AA men only.  Conclusions:   We report a distinct association of TXB2 with prostate cancer outcomes in AA men.

ADP-ribosylated AR is recognized by PARP9/DTX3L, a heterodimeric complex that contains an ADP-ribose reader (PARP9) and a ubiquitin E3 ligase (DTX3L). Here, we have characterized the cellular and biochemical requirements for AR ADP-ribosylation by PARP7. We found that the reaction requires nuclear localization of PARP7 and an agonist-induced conformation of AR. PARP7 contains a Cys3His1-type zinc finger (ZF), which also is critical for AR ADP-ribosylation. The Parp7 ZF is required for efficient nuclear import by a nuclear localization signal encoded in PARP7, but rescue experiments indicate the ZF makes a contribution to AR ADP-ribosylation that is separable from the effect on nuclear transport. ZF mutations do not detectably reduce PARP7 catalytic activity and binding to AR, but they do result in the loss of PARP7 enhancement of AR-dependent transcription of the MYBPC1 gene.

The majority of the 151 respondents (47% response rate) expressed an active decision control preference. There was no correlation between age and the treatment chosen or the degree of control men exerted over the decision-making process. Men who preferred a passive role were less satisfied with the decision-making process than were those who took an active or collaborative approach. A strong inverse correlation was demonstrated between regret experienced and satisfaction with the decision-making process. In conclusion, for men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer, taking an active role in the treatment decision making process led to greater satisfaction with that process, which in turn reduced their chances of experiencing regret following treatment.""","""['Timothy A Skyring', 'Kylie J Mansfield', 'Judy R Mullan']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Am J Mens Health""","""['Decision regret in men living with and beyond nonmetastatic prostate cancer in the United Kingdom: A population-based patient-reported outcome study.', 'Decisional regret and quality of life after participating in medical decision-making for early-stage prostate cancer.', 'Longitudinal regret and information satisfaction after deciding on treatment for localized prostate cancer with or without a decision aid.

This study aims to investigate the prognostic impacts and clinicopathological features of multiple CRCs and extracolorectal malignancies (EMs) with CRC.  Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated a total of 22,628 patients with stage I-III CRC who underwent curative resection at 24 referral institutes in Japan between January 2004 and December 2012. MPMs were classified as synchronous CRCs (SCRCs), metachronous CRCs, synchronous EMs (SEMs), and metachronous EMs.  Results:   The presence of SCRCs (odds ratio 1.54, p < 0.001) was independently associated with SEMs in the multivariate analyses. SEMs were the strongest poor prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio [HR] 2.21, p < 0.001) and RFS (HR 1.69, p < 0.001) compared with age, sex, and primary T and N factors. The incidence of stomach cancer was the highest in EMs, followed by lung, breast, and prostate cancers. Multiple CRCs were evenly distributed throughout the right-side colon to the rectum.  Discussion/conclusion:   SEMs were a strong poor prognostic factor for patients with stage I-III CRC. Patients with CRC, particularly those with SCRCs, should be surveyed for SEMs, especially for stomach and lung cancers.""","""['Kentaro Ochiai', 'Kazushige Kawai', 'Hiroaki Nozawa', 'Kazuhito Sasaki', 'Manabu Kaneko', 'Koji Murono', 'Shigenobu Emoto', 'Hiroaki Ishii', 'Hirofumi Sonoda', 'Shinichi Yamauchi', 'Kenichi Sugihara', 'Soichiro Ishihara']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Digestion""","""['Clinical characteristics of synchronous colorectal cancers in Japan.', 'Clinicopathologic features and prognosis of synchronous and metachronous multiple primary colorectal cancer.', 'Multiple primary malignancies involving primary sporadic colorectal cancer in Japan: incidence of gastric cancer with colorectal cancer patients may be higher than previously recognized.', 'Synchronous colorectal cancers: a review of clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.', 'Research Progress of Multiple Primary Malignancies Associated With Esophageal Cancer.', 'Developing prognostic nomograms to predict overall survival and cancer-specific survival in synchronous multiple primary colorectal cancer based on the SEER database.', 'Synchronous gastric cancer complicated with chronic myeloid leukemia (multiple primary cancers): A case report.', 'Simultaneous triple primary malignancies, including bladder cancer, lymphoma, and lung cancer, in an elderly male: A case report.']"""

Methods:   A nationwide cohort of Danish men who had a prostatic biopsy sample in 1998-2011 was identified from the Danish Prostate Cancer Registry and compared to an age-matched cohort from the background population. Men with other cancers, major psychiatric disorder, or prior use of antidepressants were excluded. The risk of depression defined as hospital contact for depression or prescription for antidepressants was determined from cumulative incidence functions and multivariate Cox regression models.  Results:   Of 54,766 men who underwent diagnostic workup for PCa, benign results were found for 21,418 and PCa was diagnosed in 33,347. During up to 18 years of follow-up, the adjusted hazard of depression was higher in men with PCa than in the background population, with the highest risk in the two years after diagnosis (hazard ratio (HR) 2.77, 95% CI 2.66-2.87). Comorbidity and lowest or highest income were significant risk factors for depression and the cumulative incidence was substantially higher in men with metastatic or high-risk disease. In men with benign histopathology the HR for depression was 1.22 (95% CI 1.14-1.31) in the first two years but no different from the background population after that.  Conclusions:   Diagnostic workup for PCa is associated with an increased risk of depression, mainly among men with a diagnosis of PCa.

We blueprint a holistic DP solution at a large academic medical center ubiquitously integrated into clinical workflows; researchapplications including molecular, genetic, and tissue databases; and educational processes.  Materials and methods:   We built a vendor-agnostic, integrated viewer for reviewing, annotating, sharing, and quality assurance of digital slides in a clinical or research context. It is the first homegrown viewer cleared by New York State provisional approval in 2020 for primary diagnosis and remote sign-out during the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic. We further introduce an interconnected Honest Broker for BioInformatics Technology (HoBBIT) to systematically compile and share large-scale DP research datasets including anonymized images, redacted pathology reports, and clinical data of patients with consent.  Results:   The solution has been operationally used over 3 years by 926 pathologists and researchers evaluating 288 903 digital slides. A total of 51% of these were reviewed within 1 month after scanning. Seamless integration of the viewer into 4 hospital systems clearly increases the adoption of DP. HoBBIT directly impacts the translation of knowledge in pathology into effective new health measures, including artificial intelligence-driven detection models for prostate cancer, basal cell carcinoma, and breast cancer metastases, developed and validated on thousands of cases.  Conclusions:   We highlight major challenges and lessons learned when going digital to provide orientation for other pathologists.

Methods and findings:   We obtain population cancer morbidity and mortality rates at various age, year, gender, deprivation, and region levels based on a Bayesian approach. A significant increase in type-specific cancer deaths, which can also vary among regions, is shown as a result of delay in cancer diagnoses. Our analysis suggests increase of 7.75% (7.42% to 8.25%) in female lung cancer mortality in London, as an impact of 12-month delay in cancer diagnosis, and a 3.39% (3.29% to 3.48%) increase in male lung cancer mortality across all regions. The same delay can cause a 23.56% (23.09% to 24.30%) increase in male bowel cancer mortality. Furthermore, for all-cancer mortality, the highest increase in deprivation gap happened in the East Midlands, from 199 (186 to 212) in 2001, to 239 (224 to 252) in 2016 for males, and from 114 (107 to 121) to 163 (155 to 171) for females. Also, for female lung cancer, the deprivation gap has widened with the highest change in the North West, e.g. for incidence from 180 (172 to 188) to 272 (261 to 282), whereas it has narrowed for prostate cancer incidence with the biggest reduction in the South West from 165 (139 to 190) in 2001 to 95 (72 to 117) in 2016.  Conclusions:   The analysis reveals considerable disparities in all-cancer and some type-specific cancers with respect to socioeconomic status. Furthermore, a significant increase in cancer deaths is shown as a result of delays in cancer diagnoses which can be linked to concerns about the effect of delay in cancer screening and diagnosis during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods:   The 3D printed prostate organ surrogate of the ADAM PETer phantom was filled with polymer dosimetry gel. Nine TLD600 (LiF:Mg,Ti) were installed in 3 × 3 rows on a specifically designed 3D-printed TLD holder. The TLD holder was inserted into the rectum at the level of the prostate and fixed by a partially inflated endorectal balloon. Computed tomography (CT) images were taken and treatment planning was performed. A prescribed dose of 4.5 Gy was delivered to the planning target volume (PTV). The doses measured by the dosimetry gel in the prostate and the TLDs in the rectum (""measured dose"") were compared to the doses calculated by the treatment planning system (""planned dose"") on a voxel-by-voxel basis.  Results:   In the prostate organ surrogate, the 3D-γ-index was 97.7% for the 3% dose difference and 3 mm distance to agreement criterium. In the center of the prostate organ surrogate, measured and planned doses showed only minor deviations (<0.1 Gy, corresponding to a percentage error of 2.22%). On the edges of the prostate, slight differences between planned and measured doses were detected with a maximum deviation of 0.24 Gy, corresponding to 5.3% of the prescribed dose. The difference between planned and measured doses in the TLDs was on average 0.08 Gy (range: 0.02-0.21 Gy), corresponding to 1.78% of the prescribed dose (range: 0.44%-4.67%).  Conclusions:   The present study demonstrates the feasibility of using polymer dosimetry gel and TLDs for 3D and 1D dose measurements in the prostate and the rectum organ surrogates in an anthropomorphic, deformable and multimodal phantom.

In noncancer patients, LCDs improve metabolic syndrome (MetS) without weight loss. However, concerns about negative impact on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk remain. The objective of this secondary analysis is to determine the impact of an LCD on risk of MetS and estimated CVD risk in patients with PC.  Materials and methods:   Pooled data were analyzed from 2 randomized trials testing LCD vs control on 1) preventing insulin resistance after starting hormone therapy (CAPS1) and 2) slowing PC growth in recurrent PC after failed primary treatment (CAPS2). Both trials included a usual care control vs LCD intervention in which patients were instructed to limit carbohydrate intake to ≤20 gm/day, and in CAPS1 only, to walk for ≥30 minutes/day for ≥5 days/week. MetS components (hypertension, high triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, central obesity and diabetes), 10-year CVD risk estimated using the Framingham Score with either body mass index (BMI) or lipids, and remnant cholesterol were compared between arms using mixed models adjusting for trial.  Results:   LCD resulted in a significantly reduced risk of MetS (p=0.004) and remnant cholesterol (p <0.001). Moreover, LCD resulted in significantly lower estimated CVD risk using BMI (p=0.002) over the study with no difference in estimated CVD risk using lipids (p=0.14).  Conclusions:   LCD resulted in a significantly reduced risk of MetS and remnant cholesterol, and a significantly lower estimated CVD risk using BMI. By comparison, there was no difference in estimated CVD risk using lipids. Study limitations include small sample size, short followup, and inability to distinguish effects of carbohydrate restriction and weight loss.

LDR-BT was associated with a statistically significant improvement of bFFS in the intermediate-risk cohort (HR 2.7, p = 0.02). In the low-risk cohort, no difference of bFFS was found between LDR-BT and EBRT (HR 1.9, p = 0.08). Hormone therapy was more common in EBRT than LDR-BT for intermediate-risk group (71% versus 44%, p < 0.05). Prostate cancer-specific mortality was low in both EBRT (1%) and LDR-BT (2%) cohorts. No significant difference in OS was found between LDR-BT and EBRT in low- and intermediate-risk group (HR 2.1, p = 0.2 and HR = 1.7, p = 0.3).  Conclusion:   In our retrospective study, LDR-BT is associated with superior bFFS compared with EBRT in Asian men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer.""","""['Youquan Li', 'Thomas Chan Kong Ngai', 'Siqin Zhou', 'Jerome Yap Haw Hwong', 'Eric Pang Pei Ping', 'Ashley Ong Li Kuan', 'Michael Wang Lian Chek', 'Melvin Chua Lee Kiang', 'Wen Shen Looi', 'Wen Long Nei', 'Eu Tiong Chua', 'Weber Lau Kam On', 'Terence Tan Wee Kiat', 'John Yuen Shyi Peng', 'Jeffrey Tuan Kit Loong']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Brachytherapy improves biochemical failure-free survival in low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer compared with conventionally fractionated external beam radiation therapy: a propensity score matched analysis.', 'Long-term oncologic outcomes of low dose-rate brachytherapy compared to hypofractionated external beam radiotherapy for intermediate -risk prostate cancer.', 'High-dose-rate brachytherapy with external beam radiotherapy versus low-dose-rate brachytherapy with or without external beam radiotherapy for clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Low-dose rate brachytherapy for men with localized prostate cancer.', 'Permanent interstitial low-dose-rate brachytherapy for patients with localised prostate cancer: a systematic review of randomised and nonrandomised controlled clinical trials.', 'Pan-Asian adapted ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with prostate cancer.']"""

Previous studies showed that FOXA1 expression in prostate cancer was positively associated with cancer angiolymphatic invasion and metastasis. However, the mechanism underlying the correlation between FOXA1 and prostate cancer angiolymphatic invasion and metastasis remains largely unclear.  Methods:   Herein, we set out to investigate the role of FOXA1 in the interactions between prostate cancer cells and endothelial cells. Endothelial cells' phenotypes were assessed through CCK-8 assay, Transwell migration assay, and tube formation assay. The angiogenic factors acting on endothelial cells mediated by FOXA1were characterized by RNA-seq, qPCR array, angiogenesis cytokines array, and ELISA assay. The impact of FOXA1 on tumor angiogenesis was examined in a xenograft model in nude mice. The effect of FOXA1 on prostate cancer angiogenesis was validated on a primary prostate cancer tissue microarray.  Results:   FOXA1 expression in prostate cancer cells promoted endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation in vitro. Mechanistically, FOXA1 increased pro-angiogenic factors production, including EGF, Endothelin-1, and Endoglin. Moreover, in vivo study showed that FOXA1 facilitated tumor angiogenesis. Furthermore, clinical samples investigation indicated that FOXA1 enhanced prostate cancer angiogenesis.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are significant in the advancement of prostatic cancer. The current study is aimed at exploring the potential roles of miR-373 in PCa. In turn, the study conducted a qRT-PCR test to determine the levels of mRNA. A western blot test was also executed in determining the protein level. The processes of transwell assay and wound healing were integrated in the detection of the potential for PCa cells to invade and migrate. The integration of dual luciferase reporter assay is critical in determining the levels of luciferase activity among prostatic cancer cells. Then, the results showed a net decrease of miR-373 within prostatic cancer cells and tissues. Upregulated miR-373 reduced the invasion and migration potential of PCa cells. Moreover, overexpressed miR-373 increased the levels of E-cadherin and FSP1 as epithelial cell markers. Similarly, the overregulation of miR-373 brought about the upregulation of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, Snail, and vimentin). The study predicted runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) to be a target of miR-373. The luciferase activity of PCa cells was decreased after the cotransfection with miR-373 mimics and RUNX2 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) wild type (WT). Moreover, RUNX2 became upregulated in PCa cells and tissues. The upregulation of miR-373 decreased the mRNA and protein level of RUNX2. However, overexpressed RUNX2 abated the roles of miR-373 in the intrusion and migration of PCa cells and in regulating the expression of epithelial cell markers and mesenchymal markers. In short, miR-373 may regulate the EMT of PCa cells via targeting RUNX2.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 492 consecutive radical prostatectomy specimens from our institution, which included those from 322 men with clinical GG1 and 170 with clinical GG2 tumors between years 2009 and 2018. The incidence of Gleason score (GS) upgrading, extraprostatic extension (EPE), and seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) were evaluated in patients with clinical GG1. In pathological GG1 cases, the distribution of adverse pathological features including EPE, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), perineural invasion (PNI), and biochemical recurrence (BCR) was analyzed. Results: Altogether, 78 (24.2%) out of 322 men in the clinical GG1 group demonstrated upgrading of GS, including 19 men with pathological Gleason score 4 + 3 = 7 and 6 with ≥ pathological Gleason score 4 + 4 = 8 cases. EPE was found in 37 (11.5%) and 22 (8.9%) men in clinical GG1 and pathological GG1 group, respectively. The incidence of LVI and PNI in the pathological GG1 cases was 2.8% (n = 7) and 28.6% (n = 71), respectively. BCR was observed in 4 men in pathological GG1 T2 (n = 226) and 2 men in GG1 T3 (n = 22) group. When we compared the pathological features between pathological GG1 T3 vs. GG2 T2, there was no statistical differences in the incidence of LVI and PNI between the two groups. Conclusions: Contrary to the current concept that GG1 is almost always clinically insignificant, it seems that GG1 still possess its respectable position as a group of cancer with aggressiveness.

Here, we report the first case of long-term complete remission of metastatic primary malignant melanoma of the esophagus after nivolumab monotherapy.  Case presentation:   A 79-year-old Asian man with a history of prostate cancer, gallbladder cancer, deep vein thrombosis, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus presented with gross hematuria. Cystoscopy revealed a solitary tumor on the right posterior wall of the bladder, and transurethral resection of bladder tumor was performed. Pathology was consistent with metastatic melanoma. A pigmented submucosal tumor-like growth in the esophagus was discovered on esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Computed tomography showed widespread metastases. The patient was diagnosed as having primary malignant melanoma of the esophagus with metastases to the stomach, subcutaneous tissue, lung, bladder, pleura, and peritoneum. Complete remission was achieved after seven cycles of triweekly nivolumab monotherapy. While nivolumab was discontinued because of kidney injury, the patient has remained tumor-free for over 4 years without further treatment.

Despite the rapidly growing understanding of germline variants in driving aggressive prostate cancer and the increased availability of genetic testing, there is little evidence surrounding how best to screen these men.  Methods:   We are reporting on the first 45 patients enrolled, men between the ages of 35-75, primarily with known pathogenic germline variants in prostate cancer susceptibility genes. Screening consists of an intake lifestyle survey, PSA, DRE, and SelectMDx urine assay. A biopsy was recommended for any of the following indications: 1) abnormal DRE, 2) PSA above threshold, or 3) SelectMDx above threshold. The primary outcomes were number needed to screen, and number needed to biopsy to diagnose a patient with prostate cancer.  Results:   Patients enrolled in the clinic included those with BRCA1 (n=7), BRCA2 (n=16), Lynch Syndrome (n=6), and CHEK2 (n = 4) known pathogenic germline variants. The median age and PSA were 58 (range 35-71) and 1.4 ng/ml (range 0.1-11.4 ng/ml), respectively. 12 patients underwent a prostate needle biopsy and there were 4positive biopsies for prostate cancer.

In this study, we leveraged CRPC cell lines with defined AR gene rearrangements to develop and validate a CTC DNA analysis approach that utilized whole genome amplification and targeted DNA-sequencing of AR and other genes important in CRPC. We tested the utility of this approach by analyzing matched CTC DNA and plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from a case series of ten CRPC patients. One of ten CTC samples and two of ten cfDNA samples were positive for AR gene rearrangements. All AR gene rearrangements were discordant between matched liquid biopsy samples. One patient harbored separate AR gene rearrangements in CTC DNA and cfDNA, but concordant AR amplification and AR T878A mutation.

Methods:   Two thousand and eighty-three patients were treated with mPCa between April 2003 and May 2020. Clinicopathological characteristics between groups, biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival, and overall survival (OS) were assessed. Subgroup analysis was performed on patients ≤ 60 years. Multivariable cox regression was used for survival analysis.  Results:   Three hundred and seventy-five patients (> 60 years: older) and 115 patients (≤ 60 years: young) were identified. 5-year BCR-free survival rates were 38.8% in young and 74.1% in older group (p < 0.001). 5-year OS were 88.1% in young and 96.5% in older group (p = 0.006). The significant factor associated with BCR was age > 60 (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.67, 95% confidence [CI]: 0.36-0.94, p = 0.017). The significant predictors of OS were age > 60 (HR 0.40, CI 0.18-0.91, p = 0.028) and local definitive treatment (HR 0.29, CI 0.13-0.64, p = 0.002). For the subgroup analysis, median BCR-free survival was significantly shorter in younger (≤ 56) group (14 mo vs. 27 mo, p = 0.026), and the median OS was significantly different (p = 0.048).  Conclusions:   In mPCa patients ≤ 60-year-old, BCR occurs earlier and OS is significantly reduced than older patients.

Olive leaves have a long history of medicinal and therapeutic use. In this study, the anti-cancer properties of an olive leaf extract were investigated in vitro using colorectal and prostate cancer cell lines (HT29 and PC3, respectively). A high-performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that the olive leaf extract contained a high chlorogenic acid content. Accordingly, chlorogenic acid may be related to the observed effects of the aqueous extract on cancer cells, including increased inhibition of cancer cell growth, migration, DNA fragmentation, cell cycle arrest at the S phase, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and altered gene expression. The effects of the extracts were greater in HT29 than in PC3 cells. These results suggest that chlorogenic acid, the main constituent in the olive extract, is a promising new anti-cancer agent.

The aim of this study was to analyze QoL in a broader sense, considering the subjective importance of the QoL components.  Methods:   A sample of 173 male urologic patients was surveyed twice: once while hospitalized (t1) and once again 3 months later (t2). Patients completed the Questions on Life Satisfaction questionnaire (FLZ-M), which includes satisfaction and importance ratings for eight dimensions of QoL. A control group was taken from the general population (n = 477).  Results:   Health was the most important QoL dimension for both the patient and the general population groups. While satisfaction with health was low in the patient group, the satisfaction ratings of the other seven domains were higher in the patient group than in the general population. The satisfaction with the domain partnership/sexuality showed a significant decline from t1 to t2. Multiple regression analyses showed that the domains health and income contributed most strongly to the global QoL score at t2 in the patient group.

The results showed that RMI2 expression was elevated in HCC tissues. High expression of RMI2 was correlated with shorter survival and poor prognosis of patients. The results of CCK-8, Edu, and clonogenic assays confirmed that RMI2 overexpression promoted the proliferation of HCC cells. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that RMI2 overexpression enhanced G1-S phase transition and decreased apoptosis. Moreover, the protein expression of key effector molecules in the p53 signaling pathway was reduced following RMI2 overexpression.

Social support provided by marriage/relationship could promote a healthy lifestyle and an increased healthcare seeking behavior. We investigated the association between marital status and prostate cancer risk using data from the PRACTICAL Consortium. Pooled analyses were conducted combining 12 case-control studies based on histologically-confirmed incident prostate cancers and controls with information on marital status prior to diagnosis/interview. Marital status was categorized as married/partner, separated/divorced, single, or widowed. Tumours with Gleason scores ≥ 8 defined high-grade cancers, and low-grade otherwise. NCI-SEER's summary stages (local, regional, distant) indicated the extent of the cancer. Logistic regression was used to derive odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between marital status and prostate cancer risk, adjusting for potential confounders. Overall, 14,760 cases and 12,019 controls contributed to analyses. Compared to men who were married/with a partner, widowed men had an OR of 1.19 (95% CI 1.03-1.35) of prostate cancer, with little difference between low- and high-grade tumours. Risk estimates among widowers were 1.14 (95% CI 0.97-1.34) for local, 1.53 (95% CI 1.22-1.92) for regional, and 1.56 (95% CI 1.05-2.32) for distant stage tumours.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) have been exploited as therapeutic targets in PC due to their upregulation in the advanced stages of the disease. To date, several PSA- and PSMA-activatable prodrugs have been developed to reduce the systemic toxicity of existing chemotherapeutics. Bioinspired nanovesicles have been exploited in drug delivery, offering prolonged drug blood circulation and higher tumour accumulation. For the first time, this study describes the engineering of dually targeted PSA/PSMA nanovesicles for advanced PC. PSMA-targeted bioinspired hybrids were prepared by hydrating a lipid film with anti-PSMA-U937 cell membranes and DOX-PSA prodrug, followed by extrusion. The bioinspired hybrids were characterised using dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, Dot blot, flow cytometry and Western blot. Cellular binding and toxicity studies in PC cancer cell lines were carried out using flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, and resazurin assay. Finally, tumour targeting and therapeutic efficacy studies were performed in solid and metastatic C4-2B-tumor-bearing mice. Interestingly, our PSMA-targeted hybrids demonstrated high cell uptake in PSMA-expressing cells with significant accumulation in solid and metastatic C4-2B tumour tissues following intravenous administration. More promisingly, our dually targeted PSA/PSMA hybrid significantly slowed down the C4-2B tumour growth in vivo, compared to free DOX-PSA and non-targeted PSA-hybrid. Our PSA/PSMA bioinspired hybrid could offer a highly selective treatment for advanced PC with lower side effects. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This study investigates a new approach to treat prostate cancer using dually targeted bioinspired nanovesicle . Our bioinspired vesicles are made mainly of a human blood cell membrane with a ligand recognising a specific marker (PSMA) on the surface of the prostate cancer cells. The present work describes the successful loading of a doxorubicin prodrug linked to a PSA- activatable peptide into these targeted bioinspired nanovesicle , where the active PSA enzyme presents in these cells converts the drug to its active form. Our dually targeted PSA/PSMA hybrid vesicles has successfully improved site-specific prodrug delivery to tackle advanced prostate cancer, offering a novel and effective prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Guanglong Ma', 'Maja Severic', 'Matthew Barker', 'Sara Pereira', 'Amalia Ruiz', 'Calvin C L Cheung', 'Wafa T Al-Jamal']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Acta Biomater""","""['Encapsulation of doxorubicin prodrug in heat-triggered liposomes overcomes off-target activation for advanced prostate cancer therapy.', 'Intracellular Activation of a Prostate Specific Antigen-Cleavable Doxorubicin Prodrug: A Key Feature Toward Prodrug-Nanomedicine Design.', 'Genetically-engineered anti-PSMA exosome mimetics targeting advanced prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo.', 'Targeted prodrug approaches for hormone refractory prostate cancer.', 'Efficacy Against Human Prostate Cancer by Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-specific, Transforming Growth Factor-β Insensitive Genetically Targeted CD8+ T-cells Derived from Patients with Metastatic Castrate-resistant Disease.', 'Recent advancement of bioinspired nanomaterials and their applications: A review.', 'Enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of nanoparticles for cancer treatment using versatile targeted strategies.']"""

This study aimed to evaluate the associations between PAT and LVAD-associated outcomes.  Methods and results:   We retrospectively measured computed tomography-derived PAT volumes in 77 consecutive adults who had available chest CT imaging prior to HeartMate 3 LVAD surgery between October 2015 and March 2019 at Duke University Hospital. Study groups were divided into above-median (≥219 cm3) and below-median (<219 cm3) PAT volume. Those with above-median PAT had a higher proportion of atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease and ischemic cardiomyopathy. Groups with above-median vs below-median PAT had similar Kaplan-Meier incidence rates over 2 years for (1) composite all-cause mortality, redo-LVAD surgery and cardiac transplantation (35.9 vs 32.2%; log-rank P = 0.65) and (2) composite incident hospitalizations for HF, gastrointestinal bleeding, LVAD-related infection, and stroke (61.5 vs 60.5%; log-rank P = 0.67).

Objective:   To assess cabazitaxel versus abiraterone/enzalutamide in older (≥70 yr) and younger (<70 yr) patients in CARD.  Design, setting, and participants:   Patients with mCRPC were randomized 1:1 to cabazitaxel (25 mg/m2 plus prednisone and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) versus abiraterone (1000 mg plus prednisone) or enzalutamide (160 mg).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Analyses of rPFS (primary endpoint) and safety by age were prespecified; others were post hoc. Treatment groups were compared using stratified log-rank or Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests.  Results and limitations:   Of the 255 patients randomized, 135 were aged ≥70 yr (median 76 yr). Cabazitaxel, compared with abiraterone/enzalutamide, significantly improved median rPFS in older (8.2 vs 4.5 mo; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.38-0.89; p = 0.012) and younger (7.4 vs 3.2 mo; HR = 0.47; 95% CI = 0.30-0.74; p < 0.001) patients. The median OS of cabazitaxel versus abiraterone/enzalutamide was 13.9 versus 9.4 mo in older patients (HR = 0.66; 95% CI = 0.41-1.06; p = 0.084), and it was 13.6 versus 11.8 mo in younger patients (HR = 0.66; 95% CI = 0.41-1.08; p = 0.093). Progression-free survival, prostate-specific antigen, and tumor and pain responses favored cabazitaxel, regardless of age. Grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 58% versus 49% of older patients receiving cabazitaxel versus abiraterone/enzalutamide and 48% versus 42% of younger patients. In older patients, cardiac adverse events were more frequent with abiraterone/enzalutamide; asthenia and diarrhea were more frequent with cabazitaxel.  Conclusions:   Cabazitaxel improved efficacy outcomes versus abiraterone/enzalutamide in patients with mCRPC after prior docetaxel and abiraterone/enzalutamide, regardless of age. TEAEs were more frequent among older patients. The cabazitaxel safety profile was manageable across age groups.

However, the selective inhibition of the lyase reactions, particularly with 17α-hydroxy pregnenolone, remains a challenge for the treatment of prostate cancer. Here, we considered the mechanisms of inhibition of drugs that have been developed to inhibit P450 17A1, including ketoconazole, seviteronel, orteronel, and abiraterone, the only approved inhibitor used for prostate cancer therapy, as well as clotrimazole, known to inhibit P450 17A1. All five compounds bound to P450 17A1 in a multistep process, as observed spectrally, over a period of 10 to 30 s. However, no lags were observed for the onset of inhibition in rapid-quench experiments with any of these five compounds. Furthermore, the addition of substrate to inhibitor-P450 17A1 complexes led to an immediate formation of product, without a lag that could be attributed to conformational changes. Although abiraterone has been previously described as showing slow-onset inhibition (t1/2 = 30 min), we observed rapid and strong inhibition. These results are in contrast to inhibitors of P450 3A4, an enzyme with a larger active site in which complete inhibition is not observed with ketoconazole and clotrimazole until the changes are completed. Overall, our results indicate that both P450 17A1 reactions-17α-hydroxylation and lyase activity-are inhibited by the initial binding of any of these inhibitors, even though subsequent conformational changes occur.""","""['F Peter Guengerich', 'Kevin D McCarty', 'Jesse G Chapman', 'Yasuhiro Tateishi']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Kinetic processivity of the two-step oxidations of progesterone and pregnenolone to androgens by human cytochrome P450 17A1.', 'Structural and kinetic basis of steroid 17α,20-lyase activity in teleost fish cytochrome P450 17A1 and its absence in cytochrome P450 17A2.', 'Multistep Binding of the Non-Steroidal Inhibitors Orteronel and Seviteronel to Human Cytochrome P450 17A1 and Relevance to Inhibition of Enzyme Activity.', 'The hunt for a selective 17,20 lyase inhibitor; learning lessons from nature.', 'Environmental inhibitors of the expression of cytochrome P450 17A1 in mammals.', 'Non-steroidal CYP17A1 Inhibitors: Discovery and Assessment.', 'Roles of cytochrome P450 enzymes in pharmacology and toxicology: Past, present, and future.', 'MusaATAF2-like protein regulates shoot development and multiplication by inducing cytokinin hypersensitivity and flavonoid accumulation in banana plants.', 'Inhibition of Cytochrome P450 Enzymes by Drugs-Molecular Basis and Practical Applications.']"""

Population pharmacokinetic models of ipatasertib and M1 were developed separately using data from 342 individuals with cancer from 5 phase 1 and 2 studies. The final population pharmacokinetic models for ipatasertib and M1 were 3-compartmental, with first-order elimination and sequential zero- and first-order absorption. Ipatasertib bioavailability and M1 formation increased after multiple dosing, resulting in an increase in exposure beyond that expected from accumulation alone. Covariate effects of ipatasertib include decreased oral clearance with increasing age and with coadministration of abiraterone, as well as decreased bioavailability with increasing weight. For ages 37 and 80 years, steady-state area under the curve (AUCss ) was predicted to be 81% and 109%, respectively, of the typical population value (64 years).

Patients and methods:   In a cluster randomized controlled trial, patients were randomized to either DA use (DA group) or no DA use (control group). Between 2014 and 2016, newly diagnosed patients with low or intermediate risk PC were recruited in 18 hospitals in the Netherlands. DA users had access to a web-based DA that provided general PC information, PC-treatment information, and values clarification exercises to elicit personal preferences towards the treatment options. Control group patients received care as usual. Differences in treatment choice were analysed using multilevel logistic regressions. Differences in eligible treatment options between groups were compared using Pearson Chi-square tests.  Results:   Informed consent was given by 382 patients (DA group N = 273, control group N = 109). Questionnaire response rate was 88% (N = 336). Active surveillance (AS) was an option for 38%, radical prostatectomy (RP) for 98%, external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for 88%, and brachytherapy (BT) for 79% of patients. DA users received AS significantly more often than control group. Patients (29 vs 16%, p = 0.01), whereas the latter more often chose BT (29 vs 18%, p < 0.01). No differences were found between groups regarding RP and EBRT. DA users who were not eligible for AS, received surgery more often compared to the control group (53 vs 35%, p = 0.01).

Norcantharidin (NCTD) has antiproliferation, antimetastasis, apoptosis, and autophagy effects in various tumor cells. Nevertheless, the antitumor effect of NCTD combined with paclitaxel (PTX), a chemotherapeutic drug, in PCa remains unknown. The cell growth, proliferative rate, cell cycle distribution, and cell death were determined by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide, colony formation assay, PI staining, and Annexin V/PI staining by flow cytomertry, whereas the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was evaluated using the MitoPotential assay and ER-ID red assay. We also evaluated the protein and mRNA expression of SIRTs by Western blotting and qRTPCR assay. Overexpression effectivity was measured by DNA transfection assay. Our study showed that cell viability and proliferative PC3 and DU145 rates were effectively inhibited after NCTD-PTX combination. We also found that NCTD-PTX combination treatment significantly enhance G2/M phase arrest, induction of cell death and ER stress, loss of MMP, and ER- or apoptotic-related protein expression. Furthermore, NCTD-PTX combination treatment was significantly decreasing the protein and mRNA expression of SIRT7 in PCa cells. Combination therapy effectively reduced cell viability, ER stress-mediated apoptosis and p-eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP/cleaved-PARP expression inhibition in SIRT7 overexpression of PCa cells. These results indicate that NCTD combined with PTX induces ER stress-mediated apoptosis of PCa cells by regulating the SIRT7 expression axis.

Influence of surgical experience in robotic and open radical prostatectomy""","""Purpose:   The assistance of robotic systems raises the concern of whether there is an improved learning in robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) compared to open retropubic radical prostatectomy (ORP).  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed data from 1438 patients who underwent ORP (n = 735) or RARP (n = 703). For each procedure, the level of experience of three different surgeons was summarized. Perioperative and pathological parameters reflecting surgical performance were compared between both learning curves. RARP data were influenced by new introduction of the robotic system.  Results:   The median patient age at surgery was 66 years (IQR 42-80). Patients in the RARP group were younger (p < 0.001) and had a lower oncological risk (p < 0.001). Inexperienced RARP surgeons had a higher pT2-PSM rate and lower lymph node yield (13.8 ± 4.7 vs. 14.7 ± 4.8; p = 0.03) than inexperienced ORP surgeons. After 100 procedures, RARP and ORP surgeons had the same pT2-PSM rate (8% vs. 8%; p = 0.8) and lymph node yield (15.4 ± 5.4 vs. 15.4 ± 5.1; p = 1.0). In multivariate analysis for ORP, surgical inexperience (≤ 100 cases) was an independent predictor of a longer operating time (OR 9.0; p < 0.001) and higher amount of blood loss (OR 2.9; p < 0.001). For RARP, surgical inexperience (≤ 100 cases) was a predictor of a longer operating time (OR 3.9; p < 0.001), higher amount of blood loss (OR 1.9; p = 0.004), higher pT2-PSM rate (OR 1.6; p = 0.03), and lower lymph node yield (OR 0.6; p = 0.001).  Conclusions:   Surgical experience has a relevant impact on perioperative and pathological parameters RARP has a higher initial pT2-PSM rate and lower lymph node yield than ORP.

While these treatments are effective initially, resistance occurs frequently. Continued expression of androgen receptor (AR) and its variants such as AR-V7 despite AR-targeted therapy contributes to treatment resistance and cancer progression in advanced CRPC patients. This highlights the need for new strategies blocking continued AR signaling. Here, we identify a novel AR/AR-V7 degrader (ARVib) and found that ARVib effectively degrades AR/AR-V7 protein and attenuates AR/AR-V7 downstream target gene expression in prostate cancer cells. Mechanistically, ARVib degrades AR/AR-V7 protein through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway mediated by HSP70/STUB1 machinery modulation. ARVib suppresses HSP70 expression and promotes STUB1 nuclear translocation, where STUB1 binds to AR/AR-V7 and promotes its ubiquitination and degradation. ARVib significantly inhibits resistant prostate tumor growth and improves enzalutamide treatment in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that ARVib has potential for development as an AR/AR-V7 degrader to treat resistant CRPC.""","""['Chengfei Liu', 'Cameron M Armstrong', 'Shu Ning', 'Joy C Yang', 'Wei Lou', 'Alan P Lombard', 'Jinge Zhao', 'Chun-Yi Wu', 'Aiming Yu', 'Christopher P Evans', 'Clifford G Tepper', 'Pui-Kai Li', 'Allen C Gao']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['ARVib inhibits signalling to suppress growth.', 'Allosteric inhibition of HSP70 in collaboration with STUB1 augments enzalutamide efficacy in antiandrogen resistant prostate tumor and patient-derived models.', 'Proteostasis by STUB1/HSP70 complex controls sensitivity to androgen receptor targeted therapy in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Niclosamide inhibits androgen receptor variants expression and overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Targeting the androgen receptor signaling pathway in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Development of AR-V7 as a putative treatment selection marker for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The crosstalk between ubiquitination and endocrine therapy.', 'A compendium of Androgen Receptor Variant 7 target genes and their role in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Constitutively Active Androgen Receptor in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'The Crucial Role of AR-V7 in Enzalutamide-Resistance of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Bioengineered BERA-Wnt5a siRNA Targeting Wnt5a/FZD2 Signaling Suppresses Advanced Prostate Cancer Tumor Growth and Enhances Enzalutamide Treatment.']"""

Patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer after ≥ 1 novel androgen-axis drug, either chemotherapy naïve or postchemotherapy, with sufficient bone marrow reserve, normal kidney function, sufficient PSMA expression by PSMA PET, and no PSMA-negative soft-tissue lesions were eligible. Patients were randomized (1:1) into 2 activity groups (6.0 or 7.4 GBq per cycle) and received up to 4 cycles every 8 wk. The primary safety endpoint was assessed by collecting and grading adverse events using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Patients were followed until disease progression, death, serious or intolerable adverse events, study termination by sponsor, patient withdrawal, lost to follow-up, or 24 mo after the first cycle. Results: The study was closed at enrollment of 71 of 200 planned patients because of sponsorship transfer. A total of 64 (90.1%) patients received at least 1 cycle of 177Lu-PSMA-617: 28 (36%) in arm 1 (6.0 GBq) and 41 (64%) in arm 2 (7.4 GBq).

The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of any grade in the 6.0-GBq arm, the 7.4-GBq arm and overall, were dry mouth (47.8%; 63.4%; 57.8%, respectively), fatigue (56.5%; 51.2%; 53.1%, respectively), nausea (52.2%; 43.9%; 46.9%, respectively), and diarrhea (13.0%; 31.7%; 25.0%, respectively). Frequencies of all other TEAEs were comparable among the 2 groups (within 10% difference). Serious possibly drug-related TEAEs were reported for 5 (7.8%) patients overall (none were considered as probably or definitely related to treatment): 1 subdural hematoma grade 4, 1 anemia grade 3, 1 thrombocytopenia grade 4, 1 gastrointestinal hemorrhage grade 3, and 1 acute kidney injury grade 3.

Methods:   We conducted a nested case-control study including 343 incident prostate cancer cases and 640 controls individually matched on age, race, study site, and time of blood collection. Carotenoids investigated were carotene, cryptoxanthin, lycopene, dihydrolycopene, lutein, anhydrolutein, and zeaxanthin, including α versus β configurations and cis versus trans isomers. General linear model and conditional logistic regression were applied to evaluate associations for prostate cancer risk, with adjustment for potential confounders. We conducted additional analyses with further stratification by race, multivitamin use, and smoking status.  Results:   Case-control differences were found in carotenoid subtype levels, although not all reached the multiple comparison adjusted threshold for significance. Plasma lycopene [ORT1 vs. T3 = 0.51; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.29-0.87; P trend = 0.014], dihydrolycopene (ORT1 vs. T3 = 0.37; 95% CI, 0.18-0.74; P trend = 0.006), and cis-anhydrolutein (ORT1 vs. T3 = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.33-0.96; P trend = 0.037) were inversely, while β-trans-carotene (ORT1 vs. T3 = 2.13; 95% CI, 1.32-3.43; P trend = 0.002) and trans-lutein (ORT1 vs. T3, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.20-2.88; P trend = 0.006) were positively associated with prostate cancer risk. Stratified analyses showed inverse associations of lycopene, dihydrolycopene, and cis-anhydrolutein with prostate cancer risk in subjects without multivitamin use; lycopene and dihydrolycopene in African-Americans and current smokers; and dihydrolycopene in nonsmokers. Positive associations of β-trans-carotene and trans-lutein were observed in African-Americans, nonsmokers, and multivitamin users.

Methods:   Men (mean age in 2016 = 62.0 years) who were or were not prenatally DES exposed were identified between 1953 and 1994 and followed for cancer primarily via questionnaire approximately every 5 years between 1994 and 2016. The overall and site-specific cancer rates of the two groups were compared using Poisson regression and proportional hazards modeling with adjustment for age.  Results:   DES exposure was not associated with either overall cancer [hazard ratio (HR), 0.94; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.77-1.15] or total prostate cancer rates (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.68-1.33), but was inversely associated with urinary tract cancer incidence (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.23-1.00).  Conclusions:   There was no increase in either overall or prostate cancer rates among men prenatally DES exposed relative to those unexposed.

Methods:   104 pairs of PCa tissues and matched adjacent normal prostate tissues (at least 2 cm distal to the tumor margin) were obtained. circRNA microarray analysis was performed on four pairs of PCa tissues and matched adjacent normal prostate tissues to investigate the potential involvement of circRNAs in PCa. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to investigate whether the effect of circDPP4 on PCa cell proliferation was associated with the alteration in cell cycle progression. The role of circDPP4 in PCa tumor growth was further explored in vivo.  Results:   We found that circDPP4 was overexpressed in PCa tissues and cell lines, and its expression was closely associated with Gleason score and clinical stage of PCa patients. In vitro loss- and gain-of-function experiments demonstrated that circDPP4 knockdown inhibited, whereas circDPP4 overexpression promoted the proliferation, migration, invasion and cell cycle progression of PCa cells. Knockdown of circDPP4 also suppressed PCa tumor growth in vivo. We further found that circDPP4 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-195 in PCa cells, and miR-195 negatively regulated the expression of oncogenic cyclin D1. Rescue experiments suggested that restoration of miR-195 blocked the oncogenic role of circDPP4 in PCa cells.

How this lncRNA functions in the regulation of PC chemoresistance, however, is poorly defined.  Methods:   qRT-PCR was employed to measure OGFRP1, miR-149-5p, and IL-6 expression in PC tissues and cells. IC50 values for paclitaxel and docetaxel in PC cells were assessed via a CCK-8 assay approach. Putative miR-149-5p binding targets were identified and validated through bioinformatics assays and luciferase reporter assays, respectively. The impact of OGFRP1 on PC chemoresistance in vivo was validated using a xenograft model system.  Results:   Docetaxel-resistant PC (PC/DR) cells and tissues exhibited reduced OGFRP1 expression and increased miR-149-5p expression. Knocking down OGFRP1 augmented the sensitivity of these PC cells to docetaxel and paclitaxel in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, OGFRP1 was found to bind and sequester miR-149-5p within PC/DR cells, thereby indirectly regulating IL-6 expression. Consistent with this model, the overexpression of IL-6 reversed the OGFRP1 knockdown-mediated reductions in docetaxel and paclitaxel IC50 values for these PC cells.  Conclusions:   OGFRP1 can sequester miR-149-5p, thereby indirectly promoting IL-6 upregulation and thereby promoting chemoresistance in PC cells.

Material and methods:   Fifty prostate cancer patients were treated with 5 × 7.25 Gy on a 1.5 Tesla MR-Linac. 3D Cine-MR imaging was started simultaneously and acquired over the full beam-on period. Intrafraction motion in this cine-MR was determined for each SV separately with a previously validated soft-tissue contrast-based tracking algorithm. Motion statistics and coverage probability for the SVs and prostate were determined based on the obtained results.  Results:   SV motion was automatically determined during the beam-on period (approx. 10 min) for 247 fractions. SV intrafraction motion shows larger spread than prostate intrafraction motion and increases over time. This difference is especially evident in the anterior and cranial translation directions. Significant difference in rotation about the left-right axis was found, with larger rotation for the SVs than the prostate. Intra-fraction coverage probability of 99% can be achieved when using 5 mm isometric expansion for the left and right SV and 3 mm for the prostate.  Conclusion:   This is the first study to investigate SV intrafraction motion during MR-guided RT sessions on an MR-Linac. We have shown that high quality 3D cine-MR imaging and SV tracking during RT is feasible with beam-on.

As Switzerland has the highest transurethral prostatectomy rate among OECD countries, we assessed the regional variation in prostate surgery for BPH and explored potential determinants of variation.  Methods:   We conducted a population-based analysis using discharge data for men aged ≥40 years with transurethral or simple prostatectomy from all Swiss hospitals during 2013-2018. After excluding patients with genitourinary/prostate cancer, we derived hospital service areas (HSAs) by analyzing patient flows. We calculated age-standardized mean procedure rates and variation indices (extremal quotient [EQ] and systematic component of variation [SCV]). We estimated the reduction in variance across HSAs of prostatectomy rates in multilevel regression models, with incremental adjustment for age, regional cultural and socioeconomic factors, disease burden, density of urologists, and the time since urologists' graduation.  Results:   Overall, 44,253 prostatectomies (42,710 transurethral and 1543 simple) from 44 HSAs were analyzed. The mean age-standardized prostate surgery rate was 314 (range 166-500) per 100,000 men aged ≥40 years per year. The EQ was 3.01 and the SCV 5.53, indicating a high regional variation. In multivariate models, men aged 75-79 years had an 11.6-fold higher prostatectomy rate than those aged 50-54 years. French/Italian language areas had a 21% lower rate than Swiss German speaking areas. Socioeconomic factors, disease burden, and density of urologist/time since graduation were not associated with prostatectomy rates.

Purpose:   To determine if prostate heterogeneity (1) correlates with clinical risk factors for prostate cancer and (2) associates with higher-grade tumor in systematic biopsy (SB), compared with MRI-directed target biopsy (MDTB), i.e., SB > MDTB, thus providing a rationale for combined biopsy.  Methods:   IRB-approved retrospective study included men who underwent mpMRI, SB, and MDTB between 2015 and 2017. Regions of interest were applied to the entire transition zone (TZ) and peripheral zone (PZ) on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), apparent diffusion coefficient maps (ADC), and early dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) images on the midgland slice. Mean signal intensities and standard deviation (SD) of each zone were calculated. SD served as a measure of heterogeneity. Spearman's rank correlation analysis of clinical and imaging variables was performed. Univariate logistic regression was used to determine if any imaging variable associated with SB > MDTB.  Results:   93 patients were included. Significant correlations included age and TZ ADC heterogeneity (rho = 0.34, p = 0.013), PSA density, and mean TZ ADC (rho = - 0.29, p = 0.049).

Abiraterone acetate with prednisone is currently the most common first-line therapy for the treatment of patients with mCRPC; however, the clinical impact of the addition of BRIs to abiraterone acetate with prednisone in this disease setting is unknown.  Objective:   To evaluate the association of the use of concomitant BRIs with overall survival (OS) and time to first SRE among patients with mCRPC and bone metastases receiving abiraterone acetate with prednisone as first-line therapy.  Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective cohort study collected data from 745 consecutive patients who began receiving abiraterone acetate with prednisone as first-line therapy for mCRPC with bone metastases between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2016. Data were collected from 8 hospitals in Canada, Europe, and the US from June 15 to September 15, 2019.  Exposures:   Patients were classified by receipt vs nonreceipt of concomitant BRIs and subclassified by volume of disease (high volume or low volume, using definitions from the Chemohormonal Therapy Vs Androgen Ablation Randomized Trial for Extensive Disease in Prostate Cancer [CHAARTED] E3805 study) at the initiation of abiraterone acetate with prednisone therapy.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary end point was OS. The secondary end point was time to first SRE. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards models were used.  Results:   Of the 745 men (median age, 77.6 years [interquartile range, 68.1-83.6 years]; 699 White individuals [93.8%]) included in the analysis, 529 men (71.0%) received abiraterone acetate with prednisone alone (abiraterone acetate cohort), and 216 men (29.0%) received abiraterone acetate with prednisone plus BRIs (BRI cohort). A total of 420 men (56.4%) had high-volume disease, and 276 men (37.0%) had low-volume disease. The median follow-up was 23.5 months (95% CI, 19.8-24.9 months). Patients in the BRI cohort experienced significantly longer OS compared with those in the abiraterone acetate cohort (31.8 vs 23.0 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; 95% CI, 0.54-0.79; P < .001). The OS benefit in the BRI cohort was greater for patients with high-volume vs low-volume disease (33.6 vs 19.7 months; HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.38-0.68; P < .001). The BRI cohort also had a significantly shorter time to first SRE compared with the abiraterone acetate cohort (32.4 vs 42.7 months; HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.00-1.60; P = .04), and the risk of a first SRE was more than double in the subgroup with low-volume disease (HR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.57-3.35; P < .001). In the multivariable analysis, concomitant BRIs use was independently associated with longer OS (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.52-0.79; P < .001).

Objective:   To assess the association between race and PCa care delivery for Black and White patients during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Design, setting, and participants:   This multicenter, regional, collaborative, retrospective cohort study compared prostatectomy rates between Black and White patients with untreated nonmetastatic PCa during the COVID-19 pandemic (269 patients from March 16 to May 15, 2020) and prior (378 patients from March 11 to May 10, 2019).  Main outcomes and measures:   Prostatectomy rates.  Results:   Of the 647 men with nonmetastatic PCa, 172 (26.6%) were non-Hispanic Black men, and 475 (73.4%) were non-Hispanic White men. Black men were significantly less likely to undergo prostatectomy during the pandemic compared with White patients (1 of 76 [1.3%] vs 50 of 193 [25.9%]; P < .001), despite similar COVID-19 risk factors, biopsy Gleason grade groups, and comparable prostatectomy rates prior to the pandemic (17 of 96 [17.7%] vs 54 of 282 [19.1%]; P = .75). Black men had higher median prostate-specific antigen levels prior to biopsy (8.8 ng/mL [interquartile range, 5.3-15.2 ng/mL] vs 7.2 ng/mL [interquartile range, 5.1-11.1 ng/mL]; P = .04). A linear combination of regression coefficients with an interaction term for year demonstrated an odds ratio for likelihood of surgery of 0.06 (95% CI, 0.01-0.35; P = .002) for Black patients and 1.41 (95% CI, 0.81-2.44; P = .23) for White patients during the pandemic compared with prior to the pandemic. Changes in surgical volume varied by site (from a 33% increase to complete shutdown), with sites that experienced the largest reduction in cancer surgery caring for a greater proportion of Black patients.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this large multi-institutional regional collaborative cohort study, the odds of PCa surgery were lower among Black patients compared with White patients during the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although localized PCa does not require immediate treatment, the lessons from this study suggest systemic inequities within health care and are likely applicable across medical specialties.

We investigate the kind of information patients' comments on EPIC-26 contain, and patients' motivations to provide this information. We also study why some EPIC domains spark more comments than others.  Method:   We analyzed 28 pages of transcribed comments and four pages of supplementary letters from our survey participants (n = 496). Using inductive content analysis, we generated 10 categories describing the content of participants' comments, and four themes demonstrating their motives for commenting. The comments regarding each EPIC domain were quantified to discover any differences between domains.  Results:   The sexual domain of EPIC-26 provoked over half of all comments. Patients without recent sexual activity or desire had difficulties answering sexual function questions 8-10. The lack of instructions on whether to take erectile aid use into account when answering erectile function questions led to a diversity of answering strategies. Patients with urinary catheters could not find suitable answer options for questions 1-4. All domains sparked comments containing additional information about experienced symptoms.

Protein-based toxins are attractive candidates for prostate cancer therapy because they kill cells via proliferation-independent mechanisms. However, the non-specific cytotoxicity of these potent cytotoxins must be redirected to avoid toxicity to normal tissues. Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) is membrane-bound carboxypeptidase that is highly expressed by prostate cancer cells. Potent dipeptide PSMA inhibitors have been developed that can selectively deliver and concentrate imaging agents within prostate cancer cells based on continuous PSMA internalization and endosomal cycling. On this basis, we conjugated a PSMA inhibitor to the apoptosis-inducing human protease Granzyme B and the potent Pseudomonas exotoxin protein toxin fragment, PE35. We assessed selective PSMA binding and entrance into tumor cell to induce cell death. We demonstrated these agents selectively bound to PSMA and became internalized. PSMA-targeted PE35 toxin was selectively toxic to PSMA producing cells in vitro. Intratumoral and intravenous administration of this toxin produced marked tumor killing of PSMA-producing xenografts with minimal host toxicity. These studies demonstrate that urea-based PSMA inhibitors represent a simpler, less expensive alternative to antibodies as a means to deliver cytotoxic proteins to prostate cancer cells.""","""['O C Rogers', 'D M Rosen', 'L Antony', 'H M Harper', 'D Das', 'X Yang', 'I Minn', 'R C Mease', 'M G Pomper', 'S R Denmeade']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['DUPA conjugation of a cytotoxic indenoisoquinoline topoisomerase I inhibitor for selective prostate cancer cell targeting.', 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Targeted Therapy of Prostate Cancer Using a DUPA-Paclitaxel Conjugate.', 'Auger Radiopharmaceutical Therapy Targeting Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen.', 'Toward the Discovery and Development of PSMA Targeted Inhibitors for Nuclear Medicine Applications.', 'The therapeutic and diagnostic potential of the prostate specific membrane antigen/glutamate carboxypeptidase II (PSMA/GCPII) in cancer and neurological disease.', 'Synthesis and Preclinical Evaluation of Small-Molecule Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Targeted Abiraterone Conjugate.', 'A Novel PSMA-Targeted Probe for NIRF-Guided Surgery and Photodynamic Therapy: Synthesis and Preclinical Validation.', 'Personalized 3-Gene Panel for Prostate Cancer Target Therapy.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen-targeted theranostics: past, present, and future approaches.', 'Targeted Toxins for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Our data show a role for tumor-expressed CD276 on the macrophage recruitment into the tumor spheroid, and also in regulation of the extracellular matrix modulator PAI-1.

Localized disease can be successfully treated, but advanced cases are more problematic. After initial effectiveness of androgen deprivation therapy, resistance quickly occurs. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the role of Hedgehog-GLI (HH-GLI) signaling in sustaining androgen-independent growth of prostate cancer cells. We found various modes of HH-GLI signaling activation in prostate cancer cells depending on androgen availability. When androgen was not deprived, we found evidence of non-canonical SMO signaling through the SRC kinase. After short-term androgen deprivation canonical HH-GLI signaling was activated, but we found little evidence of canonical HH-GLI signaling activity in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. We show that in androgen-independent cells the pathway ligand, SHH-N, non-canonically binds to the androgen receptor through its cholesterol modification. Inhibition of this interaction leads to androgen receptor signaling downregulation. This implies that SHH-N activates the androgen receptor and sustains androgen-independence. Targeting this interaction might prove to be a valuable strategy for advanced prostate cancer treatment.

Both plans used the original planning target volume (PTV) margins. Additionally, the potential dosimetric benefits of MR-guidance were estimated, by creating IMRT MRL plans using smaller PTV margins.  Materials and methods:   20 PCa patients previously treated with conventional VMAT were considered. For each patient, two different IMRT MRL plans using the low-field MR-linac treatment planning system were created: one with original (orig.) PTV margins and the other with reduced (red.) PTV margins. Dose indices related to target coverage, as well as dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters for the target and organs at risk (OAR) were compared. Additionally, the estimated treatment delivery times and the number of monitor units (MU) of each plan were evaluated.  Results:   The dose distribution in the high dose region and the target volume DVH parameters (D98%, D50%, D2% and V95%) were similar for all three types of treatment plans, with deviations below 1% in most cases. Both IMRT MRL plans (orig. and red. PTV margins) showed similar homogeneity indices (HI), however worse values for the conformity index (CI) were also found when compared to VMAT. The IMRT MRL plans showed similar OAR sparing when the orig. PTV margins were used but a significantly better sparing was feasible when red. PTV margins were applied. Higher number of MU and longer predicted treatment delivery times were seen for both IMRT MRL plans.  Conclusions:   A comparable plan quality between VMAT and IMRT MRL plans was achieved, when applying the same PTV margin. However, online MR-guided adaptive radiotherapy allows for a reduction of PTV margins. With a red. PTV margin, better sparing of the surrounding tissues can be achieved, while maintaining adequate target coverage. Nonetheless, longer treatment delivery times, characteristic for the IMRT technique, have to be expected.""","""['Vanessa Da Silva Mendes', 'Lukas Nierer', 'Minglun Li', 'Stefanie Corradini', 'Michael Reiner', 'Florian Kamp', 'Maximilian Niyazi', 'Christopher Kurz', 'Guillaume Landry', 'Claus Belka']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Evaluation of a simplified optimizer for MR-guided adaptive RT in case of pancreatic cancer.', 'Volumetric-modulated arc therapy vs. c-IMRT in esophageal cancer: a treatment planning comparison.', 'Quality of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy Treatment Plans Using a ⁶⁰Co Magnetic Resonance Image Guidance Radiation Therapy System.', 'Robust optimization in lung treatment plans accounting for geometric uncertainty.', 'Dosimetric comparison between Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) vs dual arc Volumetric Arc Therapy (VMAT) for nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC): Systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Local Therapies for Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Role of MRI-Guided Adaptive Radiation Therapy.', 'Assessment of intrafractional prostate motion and its dosimetric impact in MRI-guided online adaptive radiotherapy with gating.', 'Dosimetric analysis of MR-LINAC treatment plans for salvage spine SBRT re-irradiation.', 'Evaluation of internal margins for prostate for step and shoot intensity-modulated radiation therapy and volumetric modulated arc therapy using different margin formulas.', 'Clinical Implementation and Initial Experience With a 1.5 Tesla MR-Linac for MR-Guided Radiation Therapy for Gynecologic Cancer: An R-IDEAL Stage 1 and 2a First in Humans Feasibility Study of New Technology Implementation.']"""

Downregulation of death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) is closely related to PCa. Little is known about the functional role of DAPK1 in regulating cancer stem cell (CSC)-like characteristics of PCa cells, and we have conducted research on this topic. Compared with tumor-adjacent normal tissues, DAPK1 was severely downregulated in tumor tissues of PCa patients. DAPK1 expression was also reduced in PCa cell lines with respect to that in normal prostate cells. Moreover, we sorted PCa-CSCs (PCa-CD133+ cells) from PCa cells. PCa-CD133+ cells also exhibited a reduced DAPK1 level and elevated levels of stem cell markers (CD44, OCT4, and SOX2). DAPK1 knockdown promoted sphere formation and enhanced the proportions of PCa-CD133+/PCa-CD133- cells. Inhibition of DAPK1 also accelerated migration and invasion of PCa-CD133+ cells. In addition, DAPK1 interacted with zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox-1 (ZEB1) and repressed ZEB1 expression in PCa-CD133+ cells. DAPK1 suppressed Hippo/YAP signaling pathway by interacting with ZEB1. Finally, we generated a tumor xenograft model to verify the effect of PCa-CD133+ cells following DAPK1 overexpression on tumor growth of PCa.

Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed. Clinical data of patients who received total mesorectal excision (TME) with LLND at National Cancer Center, Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Science from January 2014 to December 2019 were retrospectively collected. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) rectal cancer was pathologically diagnosed, and the lower margin was below the peritoneal reflection. (2) resectable advanced rectal cancer with suspected lateral lymph node metastasis was evaluated based on rectal MRI assessment. (3) preoperative MRI showed lateral lymph node short diameter ≥5 mm and/or lymph node morphology (spike, blur, irregular) as well as heterogenous signal intensity. Lymph node shrinkage was less than 60% after receiving neoadjuvant therapy based on the reassessment of rectal MRI. (4) TME+LLND surgery was performed synchronously. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) previous history of pelvic surgery; (2) preoperative cystitis, urethritis, moderate and severe prostatic hyperplasia and other diseases resulting in abnormal urination function; (3) preoperative sexual dysfunction or loss of function; (4) patients receiving LLND due to lateral recurrence after TME; (5) distant metastasis of the tumor at initial diagnosis; (6) Incomplete collection of clinical data. A total of 73 consecutive patients were enrolled in this study. Based on the surgical approaches in performing LLND, patients were divided into fascia-oriented group (n=30) and vascular-oriented group (n=43). There were no significant differences in baseline data between the two groups (all P>0.05). The main outcome indicators of this study were the incidence of postoperative urinary and male sexual dysfunction, the efficacy, the number of lateral lymph nodes harvested and the detection rate of positive lymph nodes. Overall survival (OS) rates and progression free survival (PFS) rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by log-rank test. Results: All patients in both groups completed surgery successfully. There were no significant differences in operation time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative complications, and the length of hospital stay between the two groups (all P>0.05). In the whole group, the incidence of postoperative urinary dysfunction and male sexual dysfunction was 43.8% (32/73) and 62.5% (25/40), respectively. The median number of lateral lymph nodes harvested was 8.0(4.0,11.0) with a positive rate of 20.5%(15/73). Compared to the vascular-oriented group, the fascia-oriented group demonstrated a decreased rate of urinary dysfunction [26.7% (8/30) vs. 55.8% (24/43), χ(2)=6.098, P=0.014], lower rate of sexual dysfunction in males [6/15 vs. 76% (19/25), χ(2)=5.184, P=0.023], more harvested lateral lymph nodes [M (P25, P75): 9.5 (6.8, 15.3) vs. 6.0 (3.0, 9.0), Z=-2.849, P=0.004]. There was no significant difference in the positvie rate of lateral lymph nodes between the two groups [20% (6/30) versus 20.9% (9/43), χ(2)=0.009, P=0.923]. Three(4.1%) patients were lost during a median follow-up of 34 (1-66) months. The 3-year PFS and OS of the whole cohort were 69.5% and 88.3%, respectively. No significant difference in 3-year PFS rates (79.6% vs. 62.0%, P=0.172) and 3-year OS rates (91.2% vs. 85.9%, P=0.333) were observed between the fascia-oriented group and the vascular-oriented group (both P>0.05).

Since previous assessments of urological videos were limited to English, we systematically assessed the quality of videos on treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostate cancer (PCa), and urinary stone disease (USD) in 4 different languages on YouTube using validated instruments.  Methods:   The search for videos on YouTube addressing treatment options of BPH, PCa, and USD was performed in October 2020 in -English, French, German, and Italian. Assessed parameters included basic data (e.g., number of views), grade of misinformation, and reporting of conflicts of interest. Quality of content was analyzed using the validated DISCERN questionnaire. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.  Results:   A total of 240 videos (60 videos in each language) were analyzed. Videos on USD in English had the highest number of views (median views 271,878 [65,313-2,513,007]). The median overall quality of videos assessed showed a moderate quality (2.5-3.4 points out of 5 points for DISCERN item 16). Median total DISCERN score of all videos divided by language showed very similar results: English (39.75 points), French (38 points), German (39.5 points), and Italian (39 points). Comparing the different diseases, videos about BPH showed the highest median scores, especially in German language (median score 43.25 points).  Conclusions:   Videos concerning the treatment of BPH, PCa, and USD have a low to moderate quality of content, with no differences seen between the languages assessed. These findings further support the notion of improved patient information materials on video platforms such as YouTube.""","""['Manolis Pratsinis', 'Christa Babst', 'Janine Langenauer', 'Hans-Peter Schmid', 'Alberto Piller', 'Anne Neuenschwander', 'Patrick Betschart']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Urol Int""","""['Information on surgical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia on YouTube is highly biased and misleading.', 'Systematic assessment of information about surgical urinary stone treatment on YouTube.', 'Dissemination of Misinformative and Biased Information about Prostate Cancer on YouTube.', 'YouTube as an information source for femoroacetabular impingement: a systematic review of video content.', 'The reliability of YouTube videos in patients education for Glioblastoma Treatment.']"""

However, the registration of abdominopelvic Computed Tomography (CT) images remains challenging due to the larger displacements compared to those in brain or prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging datasets that are typically considered as benchmarks. In this study, we investigate the use of the commonly used unsupervised deep learning framework VoxelMorph for the registration of a longitudinal abdominopelvic CT dataset acquired in patients with bone metastases from breast cancer.  Methods:   As a pre-processing step, the abdominopelvic CT images were refined by automatically removing the CT table and all other extra-corporeal components. To improve the learning capabilities of the VoxelMorph framework when only a limited amount of training data is available, a novel incremental training strategy is proposed based on simulated deformations of consecutive CT images in the longitudinal dataset. This devised training strategy was compared against training on simulated deformations of a single CT volume. A widely used software toolbox for deformable image registration called NiftyReg was used as a benchmark. The evaluations were performed by calculating the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) between manual vertebrae segmentations and the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM).  Results:   The CT table removal procedure allowed both VoxelMorph and NiftyReg to achieve significantly better registration performance. In a 4-fold cross-validation scheme, the incremental training strategy resulted in better registration performance compared to training on a single volume, with a mean DSC of 0.929±0.037 and 0.883±0.033, and a mean SSIM of 0.984±0.009 and 0.969±0.007, respectively. Although our deformable image registration method did not outperform NiftyReg in terms of DSC (0.988±0.003) or SSIM (0.995±0.002), the registrations were approximately 300 times faster.  Conclusions:   This study showed the feasibility of deep learning based deformable registration of longitudinal abdominopelvic CT images via a novel incremental training strategy based on simulated deformations.""","""['Maureen van Eijnatten', 'Leonardo Rundo', 'K Joost Batenburg', 'Felix Lucka', 'Emma Beddowes', 'Carlos Caldas', 'Ferdia A Gallagher', 'Evis Sala', 'Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb', 'Ramona Woitek']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Comput Methods Programs Biomed""","""['Deformable registration of chest CT images using a 3D convolutional neural network based on unsupervised learning.', 'Deformable MR-CT image registration using an unsupervised, dual-channel network for neurosurgical guidance.', 'A deep learning framework for unsupervised affine and deformable image registration.', 'Automatic Segmentation of Multiple Organs on 3D CT Images by Using Deep Learning Approaches.', 'A review of medical image data augmentation techniques for deep learning applications.', 'Machine Learning System for Lung Neoplasms Distinguished Based on Scleral Data.', 'An automated unsupervised deep learning-based approach for diabetic retinopathy detection.']"""

Methods:   In all, 139 qualified and pathology-confirmed PCa patients were divided into a training set (n = 93) and a validation set (n = 46). A total of 1576 radiomics features were extracted from the T2WI (n = 788) and diffusion-weighted imaging (n = 788) for each patient. The Select K Best and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression algorithm were used to construct a radiomics signature in the training set. The predictive performance of the radiomics signature was assessed in the training set and then validated in the validation set by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. We computed the calibration curve and the decision curve to evaluate the calibration and clinical usefulness of the signature.  Results:   Nine radiomics features were identified to form the radiomics signature. The radiomics score (Rad-score) was significantly different between indolent and aggressive PCa (p < 0.001). The radiomics signature exhibited favorable discrimination between the indolent and aggressive PCa groups in the training set (AUC: 0.853, 95% CI: 0.766 to 0.941) and validation set (AUC: 0.901, 95% CI: 0.793 to 1.000). The decision curve analysis showed that a greater net benefit would be obtained when the threshold probability ranged from 20 to 90%.  Conclusion:   The multiparametric MRI-based radiomics signature can potentially serve as a non-invasive tool for distinguishing between indolent and aggressive PCa prior to therapy.

Materials and methods:   This multicentre, prospective study included asymptomatic patients from 2014 to 2018 (NCT02138721). Cytoreductive radical prostatectomy was offered to all fit patients with resectable tumours, resulting in 40 patients. Standard of care was administered to 40 patients who were ineligible or unwilling to undergo surgery. The primary endpoint was castration resistant cancer-free survival at the time point of ≥50% events. The secondary endpoint was local event-free survival. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses with propensity-score analysis were applied.  Results:   After a median (quartiles) follow-up of 35 (24-47) months, 42 patients became castration-resistant or died.

The aim of CPPs is to ensure standardized waiting times, but also to strengthen patient participation and shared decision-making. This study investigates how patients enrolled in a CPP experienced shared decision-making.  Methods:   This study comprised of 19 individual semistructured interviews with patients who had been enrolled in a CPP at three hospitals in Norway. Twelve patients had breast cancer, four patients had prostate cancer and three patients had malignant melanoma. We analyzed their experiences using a narrative approach.  Findings:   This study showed how participating in a standardized CPP provided different possibilities for shared decision-making. The patients' narratives of shared decision-making in CPPs included stories from the three cancer diagnoses through the following themes: (1) The predictable safeness of standardizations, (2) the ambivalence of making decisions and (3) opposing standardizations and pushing for action.  Conclusion:   Standardized CPPs provided patients with predictability and safety. Shared decision-making was possible when the cancer diagnoses supported preference-sensitive treatment options.

Materials and methods:   This is a 2-arm, prospectively enrolled, observational, patient-reported outcomes study, performed between June 2019 and November 2020 at a single academic medical center. Inclusion criteria were men undergoing an outpatient ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (transrectal or transperineal approach, without magnetic resonance imaging guidance). Patients with a history of Gleason 7+ prostate cancer were excluded. Validated survey instruments were utilized to assess baseline (Short Form 12) and testing-related (Testing Morbidities Index [TMI]) health utility states. The primary outcome was the TMI summary testing-related quality-of-life score (summary utility score; scale: 0=death and 1=perfect health). The TMI is comprised of 7 domains, spanning before, during and after testing experiences. Each domain is scored from 1 (no health impact) to 5 (extreme health impact). Testing-related quality-of-life measures were compared with Mann-Whitney U test.  Results:   Enrollment rates were 80% (60/75; transrectal) and 86% (60/70; transperineal). All patients (120/120) completed the questionnaire. The TMI summary score for transrectal biopsy was not significantly different from transperineal biopsy (0.86, 95% CI 0.84-0.88 vs 0.83, 95% CI 0.81-0.85; p=0.0774).

Investigating the differences in cancer patterns and control strategies between China and developed countries could provide reference for policy planning and contribute to improving cancer control measures. In this study, we reviewed the rates and trends of cancer incidence and mortality and disability-adjusted life year (DALY) burden in China, and compared them with those in the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK).  Methods:   Cancer incidence, mortality, and DALY data for China, US and UK were obtained from the GLOBOCAN 2020 online database, Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 study, and Cancer Incidence in Five Continents plus database (CI5 plus). Trends of cancer incidence and mortality in China, US, and UK were analyzed using Joinpoint regression models to calculate annual percent changes (APCs) and identify the best-fitting joinpoints.  Results:   An estimated 4,568,754 newly diagnosed cancer cases and 3,002,899 cancer deaths occurred in China in 2020. Additionally, cancers resulted in 67,340,309 DALYs in China.

Furthermore, the cancer spectrum of China was changing, with a rapid increase incidence and burden of lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer in addition to a high incidence and heavy burden of liver, stomach, esophageal, and cervical cancer.  Conclusions:   The cancer spectrum of China is changing from a developing country to a developed country. Population aging and increase of unhealthy lifestyles would continue to increase the cancer burden of China.

Background:   Few studies have specifically explored patients' early support needs when ending primary curative treatment.  Design:   Qualitative interview study design.  Methods:   A purposive sample of 27 participants with breast, colorectal or prostate cancer aged 33-88 years. The interviews were analysed by qualitative content analysis. Reporting followed the COREQ guidelines.  Results:   Personal support to reach a sense of control and Social support for personal growth were two main themes, highlighting that people required adapted support from health care since needs of support could change over time. This support from health care was also relying on that trust-based relationships were developed. Through mutuality with others and engagement in meaningful activities people became enabled and felt further supported. Personal support from health care seems specifically important for the patients' feelings of control and could be a facilitator for patients to identify further support for personal growth in how to manage, on the one hand, illness and insecurity, and on the other, their well-being and everyday life with cancer.  Conclusion:   To empower patients who are ending primary treatment and being close to discharge from hospital, healthcare professionals should recognise patients' shifting needs and adapt the support. Adapted support is significant for patients' sense of safety. Biomedical information is not sufficient to fully support patients.  Relevance to clinical practice:   Offering easy access to supportive care when primary treatment is finished could diminish people's stress, insecurity and avoidable use of healthcare services. Even after discharge, nurses preferably should adapt and offer support tailored to patients' needs. Such support may improve patients' sense of control and safety, trust in health care, feelings of community and encourage personal growth.""","""['Senada Hajdarevic', 'Ulrika Fallbjörk', 'Per Fransson', 'Sture Åström']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Clin Nurs""","""[""Longing to get back on track: Patients' experiences and supportive care needs after lung cancer surgery."", 'Palliative care experiences of adult cancer patients from ethnocultural groups: a qualitative systematic review protocol.', ""Health professionals' perceptions of colorectal cancer patients' treatment burden and their supportive work to ameliorate the burden - a qualitative study."", 'Electronic self-reporting of adverse events for patients undergoing cancer treatment: the eRAPID research programme including two RCTs.', 'Technology and the environment: supportive resource or barrier for people with developmental disabilities?', ""A qualitative study about colorectal cancer patients and spousal caregivers' experience and needs during COVID-19: implications for self-efficacy intervention."", ""Nurse's Roles in Colorectal Cancer Prevention: A Narrative Review.""]"""

The Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) trial randomized men with symptoms of BPH and followed response to medical therapy for up to 6 years. Treatment with a 5α-reductase inhibitor (5ARI) or an alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist (α-blocker) reduced the risk of clinical progression, while men treated with combination therapy showed a 66% decrease in risk of progressive disease. However, medical therapies for BPH/LUTS are not effective in many patients. The reasons for nonresponse or loss of therapeutic response in the remaining patients over time are unknown. A better understanding of why patients fail to respond to medical therapy may have a major impact on developing new approaches for the medical treatment of BPH/LUTS. Prostaglandins (PG) act on G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), where PGE2 and PGF2 elicit smooth muscle contraction. Therefore, we measured PG levels in the prostate tissue of BPH/LUTS patients to assess the possibility that this signaling pathway might explain the failure of medical therapy in BPH/LUTS patients.  Method:   Surgical BPH (S-BPH) was defined as benign prostatic tissue collected from the transition zone (TZ) of patients who failed medical therapy and underwent surgical intervention to relieve LUTS. Control tissue was termed Incidental BPH (I-BPH). I-BPH was TZ obtained from men undergoing radical prostatectomy for low-volume, low-grade prostatic adenocarcinoma (PCa, Gleason score ≤ 7) confined to the peripheral zone. All TZ tissue was confirmed to be cancer-free. S-BPH patients divided into four subgroups: patients on α-blockers alone, 5ARI alone, combination therapy (α-blockers plus 5ARI), or no medical therapy (none) before surgical resection. I-BPH tissue was subgrouped by prior therapy (either on α-blockers or without prior medical therapy before prostatectomy). We measured prostatic tissue levels of prostaglandins (PGF2α , PGI2 , PGE2 , PGD2 , and TxA2 ), quantitative polymerase chain reaction levels of mRNAs encoding enzymes within the PG synthesis pathway, cellular distribution of COX1 (PTGS1) and COX2 (PTGS2), and tested the ability of PGs to contract bladder smooth muscle in an in vitro assay.  Results:   All PGs were significantly elevated in TZ tissues from S-BPH patients (n = 36) compared to I-BPH patients (n = 15), regardless of the treatment subgroups. In S-BPH versus I-BPH, mRNA for PG synthetic enzymes COX1 and COX2 were significantly elevated. In addition, mRNA for enzymes that convert the precursor PGH2 to metabolite PGs were variable: PTGIS (which generates PGI2 ) and PTGDS (PGD2 ) were significantly elevated; nonsignificant increases were observed for PTGES (PGE2 ), AKR1C3 (PGF2α ), and TBxAS1 (TxA2 ). Within the I-BPH group, men responding to α-blockers for symptoms of BPH but requiring prostatectomy for PCa did not show elevated levels of COX1, COX2, or PGs. By immunohistochemistry, COX1 was predominantly observed in the prostatic stroma while COX2 was present in scattered luminal cells of isolated prostatic glands in S-BPH. PGE2 and PGF2α induced contraction of bladder smooth muscle in an in vitro assay. Furthermore, using the smooth muscle assay, we demonstrated that α-blockers that inhibit alpha-adrenergic receptors do not appear to inhibit PG stimulation of GPCRs in bladder muscle. Only patients who required surgery to relieve BPH/LUTS symptoms showed significantly increased tissue levels of PGs and the PG synthetic enzymes.  Conclusions:   Treatment of BPH/LUTS by inhibition of alpha-adrenergic receptors with pharmaceutical α-blockers or inhibiting androgenesis with 5ARI may fail because of elevated paracrine signaling by prostatic PGs that can cause smooth muscle contraction. In contrast to patients who fail medical therapy for BPH/LUTS, control I-BPH patients do not show the same evidence of elevated PG pathway signaling. Elevation of the PG pathway may explain, in part, why the risk of clinical progression in the MTOPS study was only reduced by 34% with α-blocker treatment.""","""['RenJie Jin', 'Douglas W Strand', 'Connor M Forbes', 'Thomas Case', 'Justin M M Cates', 'Qi Liu', 'Marisol Ramirez-Solano', 'Ginger L Milne', 'Stephanie Sanchez', 'Zunyi Y Wang', 'Dale E Bjorling', 'Nicole L Miller', 'Robert J Matusik']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Glucocorticoids are induced while dihydrotestosterone levels are suppressed in 5-alpha reductase inhibitor treated human benign prostate hyperplasia patients.', 'Drug adherence and clinical outcomes for patients under pharmacological therapy for lower urinary tract symptoms related to benign prostatic hyperplasia: population-based cohort study.', 'Clinical outcomes of withdrawing one medication from long-term combination therapy comprising α-blocker and 5α-reductase inhibitor for benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Monotherapy versus combination drug therapy for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Current medical treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms/BPH: do we have a standard?', 'PTGIS May Be a Predictive Marker for Ovarian Cancer by Regulating Fatty Acid Metabolism.', 'Increased COX-1 expression in benign prostate epithelial cells is triggered by mitochondrial dysfunction.', 'The anti-inflammatory properties of the methanolic extract of Cucumis melo Linn. against prostate enlargement in Wistar rats.', 'Glucocorticoids are induced while dihydrotestosterone levels are suppressed in 5-alpha reductase inhibitor treated human benign prostate hyperplasia patients.', 'Prostanoid Signaling in Cancers: Expression and Regulation Patterns of Enzymes and Receptors.']"""

However, not all men with a detectable PSA experience recurrence. We describe the natural history and outcomes in men with a detectable PSA following RP in a contemporary cohort.  Methods:   A retrospective analysis of men who underwent RP for non-metastatic prostate cancer at the University of California, San Francisco from 2000 to 2020 was performed. A detectable PSA was defined as PSA ≥ 0.03 ng/ml within 6 months of RP. Cox regression models tested the effect of detectable PSA on the development of metastasis, prostate cancer-specific mortality, and overall survival.  Results:   We identified 2941 men who had RP with 408 (13.9%) with a detectable PSA within the first 6 months. The median follow-up was 4.42 years (interquartile range [IQR], 2.58-8.00). In total, 296 (72.5%) men with a detectable PSA had salvage treatment at a median of 6 months (IQR, 4-11). One hundred sixteen of these men had PSA failure after salvage treatment at a median of 2.0 years (IQR, 0.7-3.8). On multivariable Cox regression, the risk of development of metastasis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.09; p = .01), prostate cancer-specific mortality (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.05-1.21; p = .0005), and overall mortality (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.03-1.12; p = .002) was associated with PSA velocity after salvage treatment in men with a detectable PSA.  Conclusions:   Men with a detectable PSA after RP may have excellent long-term outcomes.

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has shown promise as a reliable, grade-sensitive imaging method, but it is limited by low image quality. Currently, DWI quality image is directly related to low gradient amplitudes, since weak gradients must be compensated with long echo times.  Methods:   We propose a new type of MRI accessory, an ""inside-out"" and nonlinear gradient, whose sole purpose is to deliver diffusion encoding to a region of interest. Performance was simulated in OPERA and the resulting fields were used to simulate DWI with two-compartment and kurtosis models. Experiments with a nonlinear head gradient prove the accuracy of DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps encoded with nonlinear gradients.  Results:   Simulations validated thermal and mechanical safety while showing a 5- to 10-fold increase in gradient strength over prostate. With these strengths, lesion contrast to noise ratio in ADC maps approximately doubled for a range of anatomical positions. Proof-of-principle experiments show that spatially varying b-values can be corrected for accurate DWI and ADC.

The purpose of this project was to redefine staging of metastatic cancer. Internal validation of nationally representative patient data from the National Cancer Database (n = 461 357; 2010-2013), and external validation using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database (n = 106 595; 2014-2015) were assessed using the concordance index for evaluation of survival prediction. A Cox proportional hazards model was used for overall survival by considering identified phenotypes (latent classes) and other confounding variables. Latent class analysis was performed for phenotype identification, where Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and sample-size-adjusted BIC were used to select the optimal number of distinct clusters. Kappa coefficients assessed external cluster validation. Latent class analysis identified five metastatic phenotypes with differences in overall survival (P < .0001): (Stage IVA) nearly exclusive bone-only metastases (n = 59 049, 12.8%; median survival 12.7 months; common in lung, breast and prostate cancers); (IVB) predominant lung metastases (n = 62 491, 13.5%; 11.4 months; common in breast, stomach, kidney, ovary, uterus, thyroid, cervix and soft tissue cancers); (IVC) predominant liver/lung metastases (n = 130 014, 28.2%; 7.0 months; common in colorectum, pancreatic, lung, esophagus and stomach cancers); (IVD) bone/liver/lung metastases predominant over brain (n = 61 004, 13.2%; 5.9 months; common in lung and breast cancers); and (IVE) brain/lung metastases predominant over bone/liver (n = 148 799, 32.3%; 5.7 months; lung cancer and melanoma). Long-term survivors were identified, particularly in Stages IVA-B. A pan-cancer nomogram model to predict survival (STARS: site, tumor, age, race, sex) was created, validated and provides 13% better prognostication than AJCC: 1-month concordance index of 0.67 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.66-0.67) vs 0.61 (95% CI: 0.60-0.61).

Methods This is a Phase I, 3 + 3 dose-escalation, open-label, multi-centre study in two arginine auxotrophic cancers-Malignant Melanoma (MM) and Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC). Patients were enrolled to receive weekly intravenous BCT-100. The dose cohorts were respectively 0.5 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, 1.7 mg/kg and 2.7 mg/kg. Results There were 14 MM and 9 CRPC patients, 16 males and 7 females with a median age of 71. No dose-limiting toxicities were reported. Among all the AEs, 18 were drug-related (mostly were Grade 1). Although there were individual variations in PKs amongst the patients in each cohort, the median arginine level was maintained at 2.5 µM (lower limit of quantification) in all 4 cohorts of patients after the second BCT-100 injection. Therapeutic Arginine Depletion was found in the 1.7 and 2.7 mg/kg/week cohorts when anti-tumor activities were observed. The two cohorts had a similar AUC (20,947 and 19,614 h*µg/ml respectively).

A step forward in the diagnosis of prostate cancer""","""Introduction and objective:   ExactVuTM is a real-time micro-ultrasound system which provides, according to the Prostate Risk Identification Using Micro-Ultrasound protocol (PRI-MUS), a 300% higher resolution compared to conventional transrectal ultrasound. To evaluate the performance of ExactVuTM in the detection of Clinically significant Prostate Cancer (CsPCa).  Materials and methods:   Patients with Prostate Cancer diagnosed at fusion biopsy were imaged with ExactVuTM. CsPCa was defined as any Gleason Score ≥ 3+4. ExactVuTM examination was considered as positive when PRI-MUS score was ≥ 3. PRI-MUS scoring system was considered as correct when the fusion biopsy was positive for CsPCa. A transrectal fusion biopsy- proven CsPCa was considered as a gold standard. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) were calculated.  Results:   57 patients out of 68 (84%) had a csPCa. PRI-MUS score was correctly assessed in 68% of cases. Regarding the detection of CsPCa, ExactVuTM 's sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV was 68%, 73%, 93%, and 31%, respectively and the AUC was 0.7 (95% CI 0.5-0-8). For detecting CsPCa in the transition/ anterior zone the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV was 45%, 66%, 83% and 25% respectively ant the AUC was 0.5 (95% CI 0.2-0.9). Accounting only the CsPCa located in the peripheral zone, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV raised up to 74%, 75%, 94%, 33%, respectively with AUC 0.75 (95% CI 0.5-0-9).  Conclusions:   ExactVuTM provides high resolution of the prostatic peripheral zone and could represent a step forward in the detection of CsPCa as a triage tool. Further studies are needed to confirm these promising results.""","""['Francesco Chessa', 'Riccardo Schiavina', 'Amelio Ercolino', 'Caterina Gaudiano', 'Davide Giusti', 'Lorenzo Bianchi', 'Cristian Pultrone', 'Emanuela Marcelli', 'Concetta Distefano', 'Luca Lodigiani', 'Eugenio Brunocilla']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Arch Ital Urol Androl""","""['Prostatic high resolution micro-ultrasound (MUS) imaging..', 'The use of 29 MHz transrectal micro-ultrasound to stratify the prostate cancer risk in patients with PI-RADS III lesions at multiparametric MRI: A single institutional analysis.', 'Diagnostic Accuracy of Microultrasound in Patients with a Suspicion of Prostate Cancer at Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Single-institutional Prospective Study.', 'What Is the Negative Predictive Value of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Excluding Prostate Cancer at Biopsy?

Trasperineal biopsy is reported to have less complications and higher detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa).  Objectives:   To determine the diagnostic efficacy and safety of transperineal prostate biopsy in patients with elevated prostatic specific antigen (PSA).  Material and methods:   A prospective study included men with elevated PSA > 3 ng/ml and previous negative biopsy from January 2018 to April 2019. All patients had multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and suspicious lesions reported as Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PIRADS) score version 2. Average twelve systematic and two targeted cores were biopsied under general anaesthesia. Patients received single dose of antibiotic prebiopsy.  Results:   100 Consecutive patients having median age 64.0 years and median PSA of 6.1ng/ml were included for mpMRI-US fusion transperineal biopsies. Cancer detection rate was 45% (targeted 38% and systematic 22%) and csPCa were detected in 75.55% (targeted 86.84% and systematic 59.09%). MRI-US fusion targeted biopsies detected 63.88% csPCa in PIRADS 5, 33.33% in PIRADS 4 and 5.88% in PIRADS 3 lesions. PSA > 10 (p = 0.012), PSA density > 0.15 (p = 0.0002), and PIRADS 5 (0.0001) were significantly associated with PCa. Factors like Age (0.0001), initial PSA (0.022) and PSA density (0.006) were significant on univariate analysis while age (0.0001) was significant on multivariate analysis.

Methods:   A questionnaire was administered online to AIRO (Italian Association of Radiotherapy and Clinical Oncology) members registered in 2020 with a clinical interest in uro-oncological disease.  Results:   Sixty-one per cent of AIRO members answered the proposed survey. Explored topics included career and expertise, indications to adjuvant RT, additional imaging in biochemical recurrence setting, use of salvage radiotherapy (SRT), management of clinically evident locoregional recurrence and future considerations.  Conclusions:   Overall, good level of agreement was found between participants for most of the topics.

Methods:   The 3-month lifestyle intervention was delivered to 116 men in nine community pharmacies in the UK. Patient Activation Measure (PAM) was assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Prostate cancer-related function and quality of life were assessed using the European Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26) and EuroQOL 5-dimension 5-level (EQ5D-5L) questionnaires at baseline and 6 months. Lifestyle assessments included Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) at baseline, 3 and 6 months and Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ) at baseline and 3 months.  Results:   PAM score increased from 62 [95% CI 59-65] at baseline to 66 [64-69] after the intervention (p = 0.001) and remained higher at 6 months (p = 0.008).

The heterogeneity and mutations exhibited by prostate cancer cells often results in the progression to incurable metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Our previous investigations demonstrated that the virus-like particles (VLPs) of JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) can deliver exogenous genes to prostate cancer cells for expression. JCPyV VLPs packaging pPSAtk (PSAtk-VLPs) possess the ability to transcriptionally target and selectively induce cytotoxicity in prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, as pPSAtk can only express the thymidine kinase gene, a suicide gene, in androgen receptor-positive cells. To further investigate whether PSAtk-VLPs inhibit the growth of metastasized prostate cancer cells, we established an animal model of bone-metastatic prostate cancer to compare PSAtk-VLPs with leuprorelin acetate and enzalutamide, hormonal agents commonly used in clinical settings, and investigated the effectiveness of PSAtk-VLPs. In the present study, we observed that PSAtk-VLPs effectively inhibited the growth of prostate cancer cells that had metastasized to the bone in the metastatic animal model. In addition, PSAtk-VLPs showed a higher effectiveness than hormone therapy in this animal model study. These results suggest that PSAtk-VLPs may serve as a treatment option for mCRPC therapy in the future.""","""['Cheng-Huang Shen#', 'Mien-Chun Lin#', 'Chiung-Yao Fang', 'Pei-Lain Chen', 'Chih-Chieh Chou', 'Chun-Liang Tung', 'Chun-Nun Chao', 'Deching Chang', 'Meilin Wang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Gene Ther""","""['Gene therapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer cells using JC polyomavirus-like particles packaged with a PSA promoter driven-suicide gene.', 'Inhibition of human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma growth by JC polyomavirus-like particles delivering a suicide gene.', 'Gene Therapy for Human Lung Adenocarcinoma Using a Suicide Gene Driven by a Lung-Specific Promoter Delivered by JC Virus-Like Particles.', 'Efficacy Against Human Prostate Cancer by Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-specific, Transforming Growth Factor-β Insensitive Genetically Targeted CD8+ T-cells Derived from Patients with Metastatic Castrate-resistant Disease.', 'Update on Systemic Prostate Cancer Therapies: Management of Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer in the Era of Precision Oncology.']"""

Currently, there are no prospective data evaluating its clinical utility. We seek to assess the clinical utility of Decipher Biopsy in localized PCa patients.  Methods:   A multi-institutional study of 855 men who underwent Decipher Biopsy testing between February 2015 and October 2019. All patients were tracked through the prospective Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative and linked to the Decipher Genomics Resource Information Database (GRID®; NCT02609269). Patient matching was performed by an independent third-party (ArborMetrix Inc.) using two or more unique identifiers. Cumulative incidence curves for time to treatment (TTT) and time to failure (TTF) were constructed using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the independent association of high-risk Decipher scores with the conversion from AS to radical therapy and treatment failure (biochemical failure or receipt of salvage therapy).  Results and limitations:   Eight hundred fifty-five patients underwent Decipher Biopsy testing during the study period. Of the 855 men, 264 proceeded to AS (31%), and 454 (53%) received radical therapy. In men electing AS, after adjusting for NCCN risk group, age, PSA, prostate volume, body mass index, and percent positive cores, a high-risk Decipher score was independently associated with shorter TTT (HR 2.51, 95% CI 1.52-4.13 p < 0.001). Similarly, in patients that underwent radical therapy, a high-risk Decipher score was independently associated with TTF (HR 2.98, 95% CI 1.22-7.29, p = 0.01) on multivariable analysis. Follow-up time was a limitation.  Conclusion:   In a prospective statewide registry, high-risk Decipher Biopsy score was strongly and independently associated with conversion from AS to definitive treatment and treatment failure. These real-world data support the clinical utility of Decipher Biopsy. An ongoing phase 3 randomized trial (NCT04396808) will provide level 1 evidence of the clinical impact of Decipher biopsy testing.""","""['Randy A Vince Jr#', 'Ralph Jiang#', 'Ji Qi', 'Jeffrey J Tosoian', 'Rebecca Takele', 'Felix Y Feng', 'Susan Linsell', 'Anna Johnson', 'Sughand Shetty', 'Patrick Hurley', 'David C Miller', 'Arvin George', 'Khurshid Ghani', 'Fionna Sun', 'Mariana Seymore', 'Robert T Dess', 'William C Jackson', 'Matthew Schipper', 'Daniel E Spratt#', 'Todd M Morgan#']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Tissue-based Genomics Augments Post-prostatectomy Risk Stratification in a Natural History Cohort of Intermediate- and High-Risk Men.', 'Performance of a Prostate Cancer Genomic Classifier in Predicting Metastasis in Men with Prostate-specific Antigen Persistence Postprostatectomy.', 'Ability of a Genomic Classifier to Predict Metastasis and Prostate Cancer-specific Mortality after Radiation or Surgery based on Needle Biopsy Specimens.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Low-risk Prostate Cancer: Identification, Management, and Outcomes.', 'Prostate cancer autoantibodies - applications in diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring disease progression and immunotherapy.', 'A Novel Modality Enables New Evidence-Based Individual Risk Stratification That Can Potentially Lead to Decisive Management and Treatment Decisions in Prostate Cancer.', 'Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate as a Cause of Prostate Cancer Metastasis: A Molecular Portrait.']"""

However, TMPRSS2 expression levels were not significantly different between females and males or between younger and older populations in these tissues. The pathways enriched in TMPRSS2-upregulated pan-tissue were mainly involved in immune, metabolism, cell growth and proliferation, stromal signatures, and cancer and other diseases. Many cytokine genes displayed positive expression correlations with TMPRSS2 in pan-tissue, including TNF-α, IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-8, IL-12, IL-18, IFN-α, MCP-1, G-CSF, and IP-10. We further analyzed TMPRSS2 expression levels in nasopharyngeal swabs from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. TMPRSS2 expression levels showed no significant difference between males and females or between younger and older patients. However, they were significantly lower in SARS-CoV-2-infected than in healthy individuals and patients with other viral acute respiratory illnesses. Interestingly, TMPRSS2 expression levels were positively correlated with the enrichment levels of four immune signatures (B cells, CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and interferon response) in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients but likely to be negatively correlated with them in the normal lung tissue.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the dosimetric feasibility of a 5 × 9 Gy SBRT regimen while still limiting the dose to the urethra to 5 × 7.25 Gy. This dosimetric study is part of the groundwork for a future Phase III randomized trial.  Methods:   The prostate, the urethra and the tumors were delineated on 20 dosimetric CT-scans with MRI-registration. The planning target volume (PTVp) was defined as a 5 mm expansion (3 mm posteriorly) of the prostate. The planning at risk volume (PRVu) was defined as a 2 mm expansion of the urethra. The tumors were delineated on the MRI (GTVt) and a 3 mm-margin was added to create a tumoral planning target volume (PTVt). IMRT plans were optimized to deliver 5 × 9 Gy to the PTVp, limiting the dose to the PRVu to 5 × 7.25 Gy. Results are presented using average (range) values.  Results:   PTVp doses were D98% = 36.2 Gy (35.6-36.8), D2% = 46.9 Gy (46.5-47.5) and mean dose = 44.1 Gy (43.8-44.5). The dose to the PRVu was within tolerance limits for all 20 patients: V34.4Gy = 99.8% (99.2-100) and D5% = 38.7 Gy (38.6-38.8). Dose coverage of PTV-PRVu was D95% = 40.6 Gy (40.5-40.9), D5% = 46.6 Gy (46.2-47.2) and mean dose = 44.6 Gy (44.3-44.9). Dose to the PTVt reached 44.6 Gy (41.2-45.9). Doses to the OAR were respected, except V36Gy ≤1 cc for the rectum.  Conclusion:   A SBRT dose-escalation to 5 × 9 Gy on the prostate while sparing the urethra + 2 mm at 36.25 Gy is feasible without compromising dose coverage to the tumor.

However, limited tumor specificity is still a drawback for the clinical application of PDT. To increase the therapeutic efficacy and specificity of PDT, a novel human minibody (MS5) that recognizes a cell surface receptor expressed on various cancer cells was labeled with the hydrophilic phthalocyanine PS IR700 to generate an MS5-IR700 conjugate that is activated by near-infrared (NIR) light. The phototoxicity of the conjugate was mainly tested against the PC3 prostate cancer cell line. The MS5-IR700 conjugate killed PC3 cells after NIR light irradiation as compared to untreated cells or cells treated with IR700 alone. Time-course analysis of cell viability revealed a high percentage of cell death during the first hour in PC3 cells exposed to the MS5-IR700 conjugate and NIR light irradiation. After irradiation, the MS5-IR700 conjugate-treated PC3 cells displayed cellular swelling, round shape, and rupture of the cell and nuclear membranes. In a co-culture model, the MS5-IR700 conjugate killed MS5-positive Ramos lymphoma cells specifically, while leaving MS5-negative cells unaffected. In line with the data obtained with the monolayer cultures, the MS5-IR700 conjugate also killed PC3 cancer cell spheroids.

Methods:   Between 2010 and 2013, 36 patients with low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer were treated by HFR/IMRT-IGRT. 20 fractions of 3.1 Gy were delivered, 5 days per week for a total dose of 62 Gy. A transperineal injection of 10cc of HA was performed between the rectum and the prostate. Late toxicities were evaluated between 3 and 36 months after the end of treatment (CTCAE v4).  Results:   Median pretreatment prostate-specific antigen was 8 ng ml-1. Among the 36 included patients, 2 were not evaluated because they withdrew the study in the first 3 months of follow-up, and 4 withdrew between 3 and 36 months, the per protocol population was therefore composed.Late grade ≥2 GI toxicities occurred in 4 (12%) patients with 3 (9%) Grade 2 rectal bleedings and one diarrhoea. Therefore, the inefficacy hypothesis following Fleming one-stage design cannot be rejected. None of the patients experienced late Grade 3-4 toxicities. Among the 30 patients completing the 36 months' visit, none still had a grade ≥2 GI toxicity. Late grade ≥2 genitourinary (GU) toxicities occurred in 14 (41%) patients. The most frequent toxicities were dysuria and pollakiuria. Four patients still experienced a grade ≥2 GU toxicity at 36 months.The biochemical relapse rate (nadir +2 ng ml-1) was 6% (2 patients).

We compare treatment efficacy between state-of-the-art focally-boosted proton and photon-based radiotherapy, and investigate possible predictive guidelines regarding individualized treatment prescriptions.  Material and methods:   Ten prostate cancer patients with well-defined ILs were selected. Multiparametric MRI was used to delineate ILs, which were transferred to the planning CT via image registration. Pencil beam scanning proton therapy and volumetric modulated arc therapy treatment plans, were created for each patient. Each modality featured 6 plans: (1) moderately hypofractionated dose: 70 Gy to the prostate in 28 fractions, (2)-(6) plan 1 plus additional simultaneous-integrated-boost to ILs to 75.6, 81.2, 86.6, 98 and 112 Gy in 28 fractions. Equivalent dose to 2 Gy-per-fraction (EqD2) was used to calculate tumor control (TCP) and normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCP) for ILs and organs-at-risk.  Results:   For both modalities, the maximum necessary dose to achieve TCP > 99% was 98 Gy for very high-risk ILs. For lower risk ILs lower doses were sufficient. NTCP was <25% and 35% for protons and photons at the maximum dose escalation, respectively. For the cases and beam characteristics considered, proton therapy was dosimetrically superior when IL was >4 cc or located <2.5 mm from the rectum.

Androgen receptor (AR) signaling is a major driver of PC; therefore, androgen deprivation by medical and surgical castration is the standard treatment for patients with PC. However, over time, most patients will progress to metastatic castration-resistant PC. Enzalutamide is the only AR antagonist approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant PC. However, resistance to enzalutamide also develops in most patients with castration-resistant PC. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new AR antagonists with new structures. For this purpose, we conducted both in silico and natural product screenings. From the in silico screening, we obtained T5853872 and more potent compound, STK765173. From the natural product screening, the novel compound arabilin was isolated from Streptomyces sp. MK756-CF1. Unlike STK765173, arabilin could overcome resistance to enzalutamide.

Inactivation of inhibitory PTEN activates PI3K/AKT signaling and contributes to resistance to androgen deprivation therapy and poor outcomes. Therefore, dual targeting of AR and PI3K/AKT pathways may limit tumor growth and reverse resistance.  Patients and methods:   In this phase I study (NCT02215096), patients with PTEN-deficient mCRPC who progressed on prior enzalutamide received once-daily enzalutamide 160 mg plus PI3Kβ inhibitor GSK2636771 at 300 mg initial dose, with escalation or de-escalation in 100-mg increments, followed by dose expansion. Primary objectives were to evaluate safety/tolerability, determine the recommended phase II dose, and assess the 12-week non-progressive disease (PD) rate.  Results:   Overall, 37 patients were enrolled; 36 received ≥1 dose of GSK2636771 (200 mg: n = 22; 300 mg: n = 12; 400 mg: n = 2) plus 160 mg enzalutamide. Dose-limiting toxicities occurred in 5 patients (200 mg: n = 1; 300 mg: n = 2, 400 mg: n = 2). No new or unexpected adverse events or evidence of drug-drug interaction were observed. At the recommended dose of GSK2636771 (200 mg) plus enzalutamide, the 12-week non-PD rate was 50% (95% confidence interval: 28.2-71.8, n = 22); 1 (3%) patient achieved a radiographic partial response lasting 36 weeks. Four of 34 (12%) patients had prostate-specific antigen reduction of ≥50%.

The objective of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanism mediating cytotoxic activity of cabazitaxel in docetaxel-resistant human CRPC cells.  Materials and methods:   Parental human CRPC cell line PC3 (PC3/P) was continuously exposed to increasing doses of docetaxel, and a cell line resistant to docetaxel, PC3/R, was developed. Phenotypic differences between these cell lines were investigated.  Results:   There were no significant differences in sensitivity to cabazitaxel between PC3/P and PC3/R. In PC3/P, both docetaxel and cabazitaxel markedly inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT) and p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). In PC3/R, however, phosphorylation of AKT and p44/42 MAPK were maintained following treatment with docetaxel, whereas treatment with cabazitaxel resulted in the marked down-regulation of phosphorylation of AKT but not that of p44/42 MAPK. Furthermore, additional treatment of PC3/R with a specific inhibitor of AKT significantly enhanced the cytotoxic activity of docetaxel but not that of cabazitaxel. Growth of PC3/R in nude mice after treatment with cabazitaxel was significantly inhibited compared with that after treatment with docetaxel.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential diagnostic performance of novel 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) using a semi-localized adiabatic selective refocusing (sLASER) sequence with gradient offset independent adiabaticity (GOIA) pulses in addition to the routine mp-MRI, including T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and quantitative dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) for transition zone prostate cancer detection, localization and grading.  Methods:   Forty-one transition zone prostate cancer patients underwent mp-MRI with an external phased-array coil. Normal and cancer regions were delineated by two radiologists and divided into low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk categories based on TRUS guided biopsy results. Support vector machine models were built using different clinically applicable combinations of T2WI, DWI, DCE, and MRSI. The diagnostic performance of each model in cancer detection was evaluated using the area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic diagram. Then accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of each model were calculated. Furthermore, the correlation of mp-MRI parameters with low-risk, intermediate-risk and high-risk cancers were calculated using the Spearman correlation coefficient.  Results:   The addition of MRSI to T2WI + DWI and T2WI + DWI + DCE improved the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity for cancer detection. The best performance was achieved with T2WI + DWI + MRSI where the addition of MRSI improved the AUC, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity from 0.86 to 0.99, 0.83 to 0.96, 0.80 to 0.95, and 0.85 to 0.97 respectively. The (choline + spermine + creatine)/citrate ratio of MRSI showed the highest correlation with cancer risk groups (r = 0.64, p < 0.01).

Searching for new solutions in cancer treatments is essential because commonly used mixed, targeted and personalized therapies are sometimes not sufficient or are too expensive for common patients. Sugar fatty acid esters (SFAEs) are already well-known as promising candidates for an alternative medical tool. The manuscript brings the reader closer to methods of obtaining various SFAEs using combined biological, chemical and enzymatic methods. It presents how modification of SFAE's hydrophobic chains can influence their cytotoxicity against human skin melanoma and prostate cancer cell lines. The compound's cytotoxicity was determined by an MTT assay, which followed an assessment of SFAEs' potential metastatic properties in concentrations below IC50 values. Despite relatively high IC50 values (63.3-1737.6 μM) of the newly synthesized SFAE, they can compete with other sugar esters already described in the literature. The chosen bioactives caused low polymerization of microtubules and the depolymerization of actin filaments in nontoxic levels, which suggest an apoptotic rather than metastatic process. Altogether, cancer cells showed no propensity for metastasis after treating them with SFAE. They confirmed that lactose-based compounds seem the most promising surfactants among tested sugar esters.

RT-qPCR was used to discover molecular bases of the therapeutic efficacy of these compounds. ProB2 treatment induced a two- to five-fold increase in anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects compared to single DOCE treatment, and also had a more sensitizing effect than DOCE on DU145 cells. Regarding BC cells, ProB2- and CAT-mediated sensitization to DOCE anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects was cell-independent and cell-dependent, respectively. Combined treatment led to high-efficacy effects on MCF-7 cells, which were associated to the up-regulation of CDKN1A, BAX, caspase 9 and E-cadherin mRNA under combined treatment compared to single DOCE treatment.

The first group had antibiotherapy prophylaxis administered according to the results of rectal swabs before the procedure. The second group had routine ciprofloxacin prophylaxis administered. Patients were followed prospectively for 1 month after the procedure.  Results:   When the mean age, systemic diseases and distribution in both groups are examined, there was no significant difference observed. Fever (> 38.5 °C) was observed in 3 patients in the rectal swab group (4.3%), while it was identified in 10 people in the control group (14.1%) (p = 0.047). Major complications were observed in 3 people in the rectal swab group (4.3%) and in 7 people in the control group (9.9%) (p = 0.012).  Conclusions:   The results of the study identified that routine administration of targeted antibiotic prophylaxis may be more effective in preventing infective complications compared to standard prophylaxis. Targeted prophylaxis is recommended for risky patients in the guidelines. However, the lack of difference between the groups in terms of age and comorbidities supports the need to administer targeted prophylaxis not just to risky patients but as well as routine practice.""","""['Erdal Benli', 'Ahmet Yuce', 'Abdullah Cirakoglu', 'Ibrahim Yazici', 'Nurullah Kadim', 'Ismail Nalbant']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Ir J Med Sci""","""['Effect of Augmented Antimicrobial Prophylaxis and Rectal Swab Culture-guided Targeted Prophylaxis on the Risk of Sepsis Following Transrectal Prostate Biopsy.', '""Targeted"" prophylaxis: Impact of rectal swab culture-directed prophylaxis on infectious complications after transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy.', 'Prevalence of antibiotic resistance in fecal flora before transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy and the clinical impact of targeted antibiotic prophylaxis.', 'The role of targeted prophylactic antimicrobial therapy before transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate biopsy in reducing infection rates: a systematic review.', 'Preprostate Biopsy Rectal Culture and Postbiopsy Sepsis.']"""

However, the relevance of PHLDA3 in prostate cancer has not been explored. The purpose of this work was to illustrate the possible roles and mechanisms of PHLDA3 in prostate cancer. Our data showed strikingly lower abundance of PHLDA3 in prostate cancer, and that low levels of PHLDA3 in prostate cancer patients was associated with reduced survival. PHLDA3 was also weakly expressed in prostate cancer cells, and demethylation treatment dramatically up-regulated the expression level of PHLDA3. Up-regulation of PHLDA3 restrained proliferation, induced G1 cell cycle arrest, suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition of prostate cancer cells. In addition, up-regulation of PHLDA3 increased the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to docetaxel In-depth research into the mechanism elucidated that PHLDA3 overexpression decreased the phosphorylation of Akt and suppressed the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Overexpression of constitutively active Akt strikingly abolished PHLDA3-mediated inactivation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway. A xenograft assay revealed that prostate cancer cells with PHLDA3 overexpression displayed reduced tumorigenicity in vivo. Collectively, these data document that PHLDA3 exerts an outstanding cancer-inhibiting role in prostate cancer by down-regulating Wnt/β-catenin pathway via the inhibition of Akt.

Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PIC) is a Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist that induces tumor cells apoptosis after activation. PIC+9cRA combination activates retinoic acid receptor β (RARβ) re-expression, leading to CSC differentiation and growth arrest. Since inorganic arsenic (iAs) targets prostatic stem cells (SCs), we hypothesized that arsenic-transformed SCs (As-CSCs) show an impaired TLR3-associated anti-tumor pathway and, therefore, are unresponsive to PIC activation. We evaluated TLR3-mediated activation of anti-tumor pathway based in RARβ expression, on As-CSC and iAs-transformed epithelial cells (CAsE-PE). As-CSCs and CAsE-PE showed lower TLR3 and RARβ basal expression compared to their respective isogenic controls WPE-Stem and RWPE-1. Also, iAs transformants showed reduced expression of mediators in TLR3 pathway. Importantly, As-CSCs were irresponsive to PIC+9cRA in terms of increased RARβ and decreased SC-markers expression, while CAsE-PE, a heterogeneous cell line having a small SC population, were partially responsive. These observations indicate that iAs can impair TLR3 expression and anti-tumor pathway activated by PIC+9cRA in SCs and prostatic epithelial cells.

As an advancement beyond measures of neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES) or specific measures of the neighborhood environment, archetypes consider interactions among many social and built environment attributes.  Methods:   Neighborhood archetypes for California census tracts in the year 2000 were previously developed through latent class analysis of 39 measures of social and built environment attributes. We assessed associations between archetypes and overall and prostate cancer-specific survival in this population-based study using geocoded cancer registry data for prostate cancer patients diagnosed 1996-2005 in California, followed through 2017 (n = 185,613). We used Cox proportional hazard models stratified by race/ethnicity and adjusted for age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, tumor factors, treatment, marital status and cluster effect by census tract. Additional analyses examined associations between race/ethnicity and survival, while accounting for neighborhood archetypes.  Results:   We observed disparities in overall and prostate cancer-specific risk of death by neighborhood archetypes. Classes with the highest risk of death were defined by lower nSES, but also other domains such as rural/urban status, racial/ethnic composition or age of residents, commuting and traffic patterns, residential mobility, and food environment. Associations between archetypes and survival varied by race/ethnicity.  Conclusion:   We observe interactions among several domains of neighborhood social and built environment attributes as demonstrated by the associations between neighborhood archetypes and prostate cancer survival.

This paper presents the results of an external validation of this simulator, involving urology residents recruited during a regional teaching seminar.  Methods:   Residents from 4 academic urology departments of the French Auvergne Rhône-Alpes region, who did not take part in the previous simulator validation studies, were enrolled. After a short presentation and standardized initiation session, residents carried out a simulated systematic 12-core biopsy procedure and were asked to fill in a questionnaire collecting their expectations and evaluation of the Biopsym simulator. The number of biopsies reaching each targeted sector, the total score provided by the simulator and the duration of the procedure were recorded.  Results:   Twenty-three residents were recruited. The overall added value (/100) for learning was rated at a median of 100 (interquartile range 83-100), overall realism of the biopsy procedure at 80 (65-89). The median percentage of biopsies reaching the targeted sector was 66.7% (62-75). The median score provided by the simulator was 50% (37-60). For both, the difference between residents with or without prior biopsy experience was not statistically significant. The median duration of the simulated biopsy procedure was 4:58 (minutes: seconds) (3:49-6:00). Resident with prior experience required less time to complete the biopsy procedure 3:53 (3:39-4:56) vs. 5:10 (4:59-7:10), P=0.01.  Conclusion:   This external validation study confirms a high acceptance of the simulator by the target audience.

In the absence of evidence, opinions and practice patterns vary. We surveyed Canadian prostate cancer surgeons about their use of adjuvant ADT and their opinions on the design of a potential adjuvant ADT trial.  Methods:   An electronic survey was devised and distributed using a modified Dillman approach. The survey was sent to 38 Canadian urologists that perform radical prostatectomy and representing all 17 major academic institutions in Canada and all 10 Canadian provinces. Reminders were sent three and four weeks following the original request. In addition to demographic information, we asked surgeons about their current use of postoperative adjuvant ADT and their opinion about the need for a clinical trial. To inform trial design, we asked respondents their opinions about which patients should be eligible, what duration of ADT was most appropriate, and which outcomes are clinically meaningful. The survey was sent in February 2020 and all responses were received by March 2020.  Results:   All 38 (100%) invited urologists completed the survey. Only 3 (7%) respondents currently offer postoperative adjuvant ADT as an option for patients without metastases. 35 (92%) urologists believed that a trial is needed before short-term adjuvant treatment should be offered to prevent recurrence. 15 (45%) urologists believed an adjuvant ADT trial was most appropriate for patients with an estimated PSA recurrence risk of >25% and 16 (42%) believed a recurrence risk of >50% was most appropriate. 25 (66%) respondents believed 12-month was the optimal duration of treatment with adjuvant ADT for a randomized trial. 37 (97%) respondents felt that prolonging the time to PSA recurrence and/or pelvic radiation was a clinically important outcome. The majority (20; 53%) of respondents would recommend 12 months of adjuvant ADT in their practice if a randomized trial showed a 50% relative risk reduction in PSA recurrence at 5-year postoperative.  Conclusion:   The vast majority of Canadian prostate cancer surgeons do not offer adjuvant ADT following prostatectomy in patients without metastases.

However, there are domains where the training of classification models that generalize on several datasets is still an open challenge because of the highly heterogeneous data and the lack of large datasets with local annotations of the regions of interest, such as histopathology image analysis. Histopathology concerns the microscopic analysis of tissue specimens processed in glass slides to identify diseases such as cancer. Digital pathology concerns the acquisition, management and automatic analysis of digitized histopathology images that are large, having in the order of 100'0002 pixels per image. Digital histopathology images are highly heterogeneous due to the variability of the image acquisition procedures. Creating locally labeled regions (required for the training) is time-consuming and often expensive in the medical field, as physicians usually have to annotate the data. Despite the advances in deep learning, leveraging strongly and weakly annotated datasets to train classification models is still an unsolved problem, mainly when data are very heterogeneous. Large amounts of data are needed to create models that generalize well. This paper presents a novel approach to train CNNs that generalize to heterogeneous datasets originating from various sources and without local annotations. The data analysis pipeline targets Gleason grading on prostate images and includes two models in sequence, following a teacher/student training paradigm. The teacher model (a high-capacity neural network) automatically annotates a set of pseudo-labeled patches used to train the student model (a smaller network). The two models are trained with two different teacher/student approaches: semi-supervised learning and semi-weekly supervised learning. For each of the two approaches, three student training variants are presented. The baseline is provided by training the student model only with the strongly annotated data. Classification performance is evaluated on the student model at the patch level (using the local annotations of the Tissue Micro-Arrays Zurich dataset) and at the global level (using the TCGA-PRAD, The Cancer Genome Atlas-PRostate ADenocarcinoma, whole slide image Gleason score). The teacher/student paradigm allows the models to better generalize on both datasets, despite the inter-dataset heterogeneity and the small number of local annotations used. The classification performance is improved both at the patch-level (up to κ=0.6127±0.0133 from κ=0.5667±0.0285), at the TMA core-level (Gleason score) (up to κ=0.7645±0.0231 from κ=0.7186±0.0306) and at the WSI-level (Gleason score) (up to κ=0.4529±0.0512 from κ=0.2293±0.1350).

Methods and materials:   This retrospective analysis includes low- and intermediate-risk patients with prostate cancer treated between 1998 and 2018 at an National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center. Demographics and treatment characteristics were prospectively collected. Patients had at least 2 PSA measurements within 24 months of treatment and were free from biochemical recurrence. The incidence of, time to, and risk factors for PSA nadir (nPSA) and bounce (bPSA) were analyzed at 24 months after radiation therapy. Ideal PSA kinetics were characterized for each modality and compared.  Results:   Of 1042 patients, 45% had low-risk cancer, 37% favorable intermediate risk, and 19% unfavorable intermediate risk. nPSAs were higher for ablative modalities, both as absolute nPSA and relative to initial PSA. Median time to nPSA ranged from 14.8 to 17.1 months. Over 50% treated with nonablative therapy (conventionally fractionated, hypofractionated, and low-dose rate) reached an nPSA threshold of ≤0.5 ng/mL compared with 23% of stereotactic body radiation therapy and 33% of high-dose rate cohorts. The incidence of bPSA was 13.3% and not affected by treatment modality, Gleason score, or prostate volume. PSA decay rate was faster for ablative therapies in the 6- to 24-month period.  Conclusions:   Analysis of PSA within 24 months after radiation therapy revealed ablative therapies are associated with a latent PSA response and higher nPSA.

However, its therapeutic efficacy for prostate cancer is not yet fully understood. In this study, the predictors of therapeutic efficacy of 5-aminolevulinic acid-based PDT (ALA-PDT) on prostate cancer cells are investigated.  Materials and methods:   The human prostate cancer cell lines, PC-3, 22Rv1, DU145, and LNCap were used to investigate the effects of ALA-PDT on protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) intracellular accumulation, which was measured by flow cytometry. The cytotoxicity of ALA-PDT was evaluated by MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. The levels of porphyrin metabolism-related enzyme and transporter mRNA were comprehensively evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Protein expression was evaluated by Western blot. A xenograft model was created using PC-3 and 22Rv1, and then, pathological analysis was performed to determine the therapeutic effect of ALA-PDT RESULTS: PC-3 and LNCap cells showed high accumulation of PpIX and high sensitivity to ALA-PDT, while 22Rv1 and DU145 showed low accumulation of PpIX and low sensitivity to ALA-PDT. ALA-PDT-induced cytotoxicity correlated negatively with PpIX accumulation. The in vitro assays identified the ATP-binding cassette transporter subfamily G2 (ABCG2) transporter dimer as a predictor of treatment response. In vivo immunohistochemical staining of ABCG2 transporter showed low expression in PC-3 cells and high expression in 22Rv1 cells, and ALA-PDT-induced tumor tissue degeneration was greater in PC-3 cells than in 22Rv1 cells.  Conclusion:   The ABCG2 transporter is a useful predictor of the therapeutic effect of ALA-PDT on human prostate cancer cells.""","""['Shinkuro Yamamoto', 'Hideo Fukuhara', 'Hitomi Seki', 'Chiaki Kawada', 'Taku Nakayama', 'Takashi Karashima', 'Shun-Ichiro Ogura', 'Keiji Inoue']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther""","""['Novel potential photodynamic therapy strategy using 5-Aminolevulinic acid for ovarian clear-cell carcinoma.', 'The inhibition of ferrochelatase enhances 5-aminolevulinic acid-based photodynamic action for prostate cancer.', 'Pivotal roles of peptide transporter PEPT1 and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCG2 in 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-based photocytotoxicity of gastric cancer cells in vitro.', 'Critical role of ABCG2 in ALA-photodynamic diagnosis and therapy of human brain tumor.', 'Aminolevulinic Acid-Based Tumor Detection and Therapy: Molecular Mechanisms and Strategies for Enhancement.', 'A Microfluidic System for Detecting Tumor Cells Based on Biomarker Hexaminolevulinate (HAL): Applications in Pleural Effusion.']"""

Methods:   Patients from the Prospective Loyola University mpMRI (PLUM) Prostate Biopsy Cohort (January 2015-December 2020) without prior diagnosis of PCa were evaluated for APLs by race. Multivariable logistic regression models evaluated predictors of APLs and associations of APLs and race with detection of any PCa (grade group 1+) and clinically significant PCa (csPCa; grade group 2+). Additional stratified and propensity score matched analyses were conducted.  Results:   Of 1,239 men included, 190 (15.3%) were AA and 302 (24.4%) had at least one APL with no differences by race on multivariable analysis. While men with APLs were twice as likely to harbor PCa or csPCa, the unadjusted proportion of targeted biopsy-confirmed APL PCa (12.6% vs 12.0%) or csPCa (8.4% vs 8.9%) were similar for AA and non-AA men. AA men had higher risk of prostate cancer on targeted cores (OR 1.66 (95%CI 1.06 - 2.61), P = 0.026) which was independent of lesion location or PI-RADS.  Conclusion:   AA men were found to have similar rates of APLs on mpMRI to non-AA men indicating access to mpMRI may mitigate some of the historical racial disparity based on lesion location.

Our study aimed to compare men in the PCa group with a control group in terms of sexual behavior like partner numbers and ejaculation frequency, and inflammatory parameters examined in serum.  Material and methods:   This study was performed prospectively between 2013 and April 2020 and the record system was kept by a single doctor. Patients were prospectively recorded by a single person. Patients with diagnosis of PCa were compared with a control group in terms of sexual behavior and in terms of inflammatory parameters like neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR, neutrophil count/lymphocyte count), systemic inflammatory index (SII, neutrophil count x platelet count/lymphocyte count).  Results:   In this study, median marriage age was 18 ± 6 years in the control group and 20 ± 2.97 in the PCa group (P = .001). The median lifelong partner number was observed to be 1 ± 1 in the control group and 1 ± 9 in the PCa group (median ± IQR). Additionally, lifelong median ejaculation frequency was determined as 12 ± 5 for controls and 10 ± 4 for the PCa group. Inflammatory markers examined in serum and SII scores were observed to be statistically significantly increased in the cancer group.  Conclusion:   The sexual behavior and inflammatory parameters among patients with PCa diagnosis were identified to be significantly high compared to the control group and appear to be possible correctable risk factors.

This randomized controlled trial aimed to identify the simplest, most effective approach for survivorship care planning.  Methods:   Stage 1-3 breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer patients aged 21 years or older completing treatment were recruited from an urban-academic and rural-community cancer center. Participants were randomly assigned, stratified by recruitment site and cancer type 1:1:1 to a mailed plan, plan delivered during a 1-time transition visit, or plan delivered during a transition visit plus 6-month follow-up visit. Health service use data were collected from participants and medical records for 18 months. The primary outcome, receipt of all plan-recommended care, was compared across intervention arms using logistic regression adjusting for cancer type and recruitment site, with P less than .05 considered statistically significant.  Results:   Of 378 participants randomly assigned, 159 (42.1%) were breast, 142 (37.6%) prostate, and 77 (20.4%) colorectal cancer survivors; 207 (54.8%) from the academic site and 171 (45.2%) from the community site; 316 were analyzable for the primary outcome. There was no difference across arms in the proportion of participants receiving all plan-recommended care: 45.2% mail, 50.5% 1-visit, 42.7% 2-visit (2-sided P = .60).

Recent studies demonstrated the efficacy of anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) immunotherapies in metastatic prostate cancer. The ataxia telangiectasia mutation (ATM) protein plays a crucial role in maintaining genome stability and function of mitosis. Here, we aimed to determine whether PD-1/PD-L1 signaling contributes to the resistance to DTX and to elucidate the mechanism underlying DTX-induced PD-L1 expression.  Methods:   In this retrospective study, PD-L1 expression was analyzed in 33 tumor tissue samples from prostate cancer patients. Prostate cell lines were used to perform functional assays and examine underlying mechanisms in vitro. A fully mouse prostate cancer model and a humanized chimeric mouse bearing human prostate tumors and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used for in vivo assays.  Results:   We have shown that DTX, a chemotherapeutic drug which causing microtubule interference, could significantly induce the expression of PD-L1 in prostate cancer cells. This effect is blocked by the inhibition of ATM, suggesting that it plays an essential role in PD-L1 expression upregulated by DTX. Mechanistic studies have shown that ATM activity in cancer cells enhances the stability of the NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO), which leading to an increase in the NF-κB activity and PD-L1 expression. Using the mouse model, it was further demonstrated that a combination of ATM and NEMO inhibitors along with DTX augmented the antitumor efficacy of chemotherapy, which are comparable to that of PD-L1 antibody.  Conclusions:   Our findings have revealed that a previously unrecognized ATM-NEMO signaling which induced by DTX is capable of suppressing tumor immunity by activating the expression of PD-L1, suggesting that the ATM-NEMO-NF-κB axis can be exploited to restore the immune balance and overcome cancer resistance triggered by DTX.Graphic Abstract: supplementary file 1.""","""['Zongren Wang#', 'Xueling Zhang#', 'Wuguo Li#', 'Qiao Su', 'Zhaoyang Huang', 'Xinyao Zhang', 'Haiqi Chen', 'Chengqiang Mo', 'Bin Huang', 'Wei Ou', 'Junxing Chen', 'Guangyin Zhao', 'Lingwu Chen', 'Lan Shao']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Immunother Cancer""","""['LncRNA LINC00184 promotes docetaxel resistance and immune escape via miR-105-5p/PD-L1 axis in prostate cancer.', 'Shikonin-mediated PD-L1 degradation suppresses immune evasion in pancreatic cancer by inhibiting NF-κB/STAT3 and NF-κB/CSN5 signaling pathways.', 'Phosphorylated RB Promotes Cancer Immunity by Inhibiting NF-κB Activation and PD-L1 Expression.', 'Immunotherapy with PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors for prostate cancer.', 'PD-L1 Inhibitors for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'A Triphenylphosphonium-Functionalized Delivery System for an ATM Kinase Inhibitor That Ameliorates Doxorubicin Resistance in Breast Carcinoma Mammospheres.', 'PMN-MDSCs modulated by CCL20 from cancer cells promoted breast cancer cell stemness through CXCL2-CXCR2 pathway.', 'Hepatocyte Transplantation Rebalances Cytokines for Hepatic Regeneration in Rats with Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Pathway-Related Acute Liver Failure.', 'Anti-cancer immune responses to DNA damage response inhibitors: Molecular mechanisms and progress toward clinical translation.', 'CPT1A-Mediated Fatty Acid Oxidation Promotes Precursor Osteoclast Fusion in Rheumatoid Arthritis.']"""

Most studies have focused on investigating cell-autonomous alterations in CRPC, while the contributions of the tumor microenvironment are less well understood. Here we sought to determine the role of tumor-associated macrophages in CRPC, based upon their role in cancer progression and therapeutic resistance. In a syngeneic model that reflected the mutational landscape of CRPC, macrophage depletion resulted in a reduced transcriptional signature for steroid and bile acid synthesis, indicating potential perturbation of cholesterol metabolism. As cholesterol is the precursor of the five major types of steroid hormones, we hypothesized that macrophages were regulating androgen biosynthesis within the prostate tumor microenvironment. Macrophage depletion reduced androgen levels within prostate tumors and restricted AR nuclear localization in vitro and in vivo. Macrophages were also cholesterol-rich and were able to transfer cholesterol to tumor cells in vitro. AR nuclear translocation was inhibited by activation of liver X receptor (LXR)-β, the master regulator of cholesterol homeostasis.

Resistance training can counter both muscle and physical function loss; however, an understanding of the molecular responses of skeletal muscle to resistance training during ADT is still undefined. This sub-analysis of the original randomized, controlled pilot trial investigated effects of 12 weeks of periodized resistance training on mRNA expression of the anabolic genes IGF-1, myogenin, PGC-1α4 and the catabolic genes myostatin and MuRF-1 in skeletal muscle of PCS on ADT. Secondary aims investigated if changes in lean mass and physical function correlated with changes in mRNA expression.  Methods:   PCS on ADT (n = 17) were randomized to 12 weeks of supervised resistance training (EXE, n = 9) or home-based stretching (STRETCH, n = 8) 3 days per week. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Muscle biopsies were analyzed by RT-PCR for mRNA expression. Body composition was assessed through dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and physical function through muscular strength, timed up and go, stair climb, and 400 m walk.  Results:   MuRF-1 mRNA expression was significantly greater in EXE compared to STRETCH post-intervention (P = .005). Change in MuRF-1 mRNA expression significantly correlated with improvements in strength and physical function (P < .05), while change in IGF-1 expression correlated with change in lean mass (P = .015).  Conclusion:   Twelve weeks of resistance training increased mRNA expression of MuRF-1 in skeletal muscle of PCS on ADT. Elevations in resting mRNA expression of IGF-1, myogenin and PGC-1α4, and reduction in mRNA expression of myostatin that are typically expected following resistance training were not observed.""","""['Jacqueline K Dawson', 'Tanya B Dorff', 'Creighton Tuzon', 'Judd C Rice', 'Edward Todd Schroeder', 'Christianne J Lane', 'Mitchell E Gross', 'Christina M Dieli-Conwright']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Integr Cancer Ther""","""['Impact of resistance training on body composition and metabolic syndrome variables during androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a pilot randomized controlled trial.', 'A pilot randomised controlled trial of a periodised resistance training and protein supplementation intervention in prostate cancer survivors on androgen deprivation therapy.', ""Moderators of resistance-based exercise programs' effect on sarcopenia-related measures in men with prostate cancer previously or currently undergoing androgen deprivation therapy: An individual patient data meta-analysis."", 'Targeting muscle signaling pathways to minimize adverse effects of androgen deprivation.', 'Does Androgen Deprivation for Prostate Cancer Affect Normal Adaptation to Resistance Exercise?', 'Insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling in the tumor microenvironment: Carcinogenesis, cancer drug resistance, and therapeutic potential.']"""

However, the impact of the molecular interplay between testosterone-associated genes on therapy response and susceptibility to disease relapse in PCa patients remains underexplored. Objective: This study investigated the role of dysregulated or aberrantly expressed testosterone-associated genes in the enhanced dissemination, phenoconversion, and therapy response of treatment-resistant advanced or recurrent PCa. Methods: Employing a combination of multi-omics big data analyses, in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo assays, we assessed the probable roles of HSD17B2, HSD17B3, SHBG, and SRD5A1-mediated testosterone metabolism in the progression, therapy response, and prognosis of advanced or castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). Results: Our bioinformatics-aided gene expression profiling and immunohistochemical staining showed that the aberrant expression of the HSD17B2, HSD17B3, SHBG, and SRD5A1 testosterone metabolic tetrad characterize androgen-driven PCa and is associated with disease progression. Reanalysis of the TCGA PRAD cohort (n = 497) showed that patients with SRD5A1-dominant high expression of the tetrad exhibited worse mid-term to long-term (≥5 years) overall survival, with a profoundly shorter time to recurrence, compared to those with low expression. More so, we observed a strong association between enhanced HSD17B2/SRD5A1 signaling and metastasis to distant lymph nodes (M1a) and bones (M1b), while upregulated HSD17B3/SHBG signaling correlated more with negative metastasis (M0) status. Interestingly, increased SHBG/SRD5A1 ratio was associated with metastasis to distant organs (M1c), while elevated SRD5A1/SHBG ratio was associated with positive biochemical recurrence (BCR) status, and shorter time to BCR. Molecular enrichment and protein-protein connectivity network analyses showed that the androgenic tetrad regulates testosterone metabolism and cross-talks with modulators of drug response, effectors of cell cycle progression, proliferation or cell motility, and activators/mediators of cancer stemness. Moreover, of clinical relevance, SHBG ectopic expression (SHBG_OE) or SRD5A1 knockout (sgSRD5A1) induced the acquisition of spindle fibroblastoid morphology by the round/polygonal metastatic PC-3 and LNCaP cells, attenuated their migration and invasion capability, and significantly suppressed their ability to form primary or secondary tumorspheres, with concomitant downregulation of stemness KLF4, OCT3/4, and drug resistance ABCC1, ABCB1 proteins expression levels. We also showed that metronomic dutasteride synergistically enhanced the anticancer effect of low-dose docetaxel, in vitro, and in vivo. Conclusion: These data provide proof of concept that re-reprogramming of testosterone metabolism through ""SRD5A1 withdrawal"" or ""SHBG induction"" is a workable therapeutic strategy for shutting down androgen-driven oncogenic signals, reversing treatment resistance, and repressing the metastatic/recurrent phenotypes of patients with PCa.""","""['Oluwaseun Adebayo Bamodu', 'Kai-Yi Tzou', 'Chia-Da Lin', 'Su-Wei Hu', 'Yuan-Hung Wang', 'Wen-Ling Wu', 'Kuan-Chou Chen', 'Chia-Chang Wu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancers (Basel)""","""['Genetic Suppressor Element 1 (GSE1) Promotes the Oncogenic and Recurrent Phenotypes of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer by Targeting Tumor-Associated Calcium Signal Transducer 2 (TACSTD2).', 'MED10 Drives the Oncogenicity and Refractory Phenotype of Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma Through the Upregulation of hsa-miR-590.', 'Pharmacologic basis for the enhanced efficacy of dutasteride against prostatic cancers.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Furthermore, we proposed ratiometric analysis without requiring normalization to a reference miRNA and validated the clinical diagnostic potential toward differentiating prostate cancer patients from healthy controls. Our hydrogel-based HCR could serve as a new diagnostic platform for a non-invasive liquid biopsy before burdensome tissue biopsy of various diseases, including prostate cancer screening, complementing the PSA test.""","""['Junbeom Kim', 'Ji Sung Shim', 'Bo Hoon Han', 'Hye Jin Kim', 'Jaesung Park', 'Il-Joo Cho', 'Sung Gu Kang', 'Ji Yoon Kang', 'Ki Wan Bong', 'Nakwon Choi']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Biosens Bioelectron""","""['Exosomal and Non-Exosomal Urinary miRNAs in Prostate Cancer Detection and Prognosis.', 'Exosomal microRNAs in liquid biopsies: future biomarkers for prostate cancer.', 'Lectin-induced agglutination method of urinary exosomes isolation followed by mi-RNA analysis: Application for prostate cancer diagnostic.', 'Three-dimensional hierarchical plasmonic nano-architecture based label-free surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy detection of urinary exosomal miRNA for clinical diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate Cancer Detection and Prognosis: From Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) to Exosomal Biomarkers.', 'Enzymatic reaction modulated DNA assembly on graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets for sensitive fluorescence detection of acetylcholinesterase activity and inhibition.', 'Dynamic Role of Exosome microRNAs in Cancer Cell Signaling and Their Emerging Role as Noninvasive Biomarkers.', 'Ratiometric electrochemical OR gate assay for NSCLC-derived exosomes.', 'Recent Advances in Exosomal miRNA Biosensing for Liquid Biopsy.', 'Biological Features of Extracellular Vesicles and Challenges.']"""

We developed a simple quantitative model of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) dynamics to evaluate prostate cancer (PCa) stem cell enrichment as a plausible driver of AA treatment resistance. The model incorporated PCa stem cells, non-stem PCa cells and PSA dynamics during adaptive therapy. A leave-one-out analysis was used to calibrate and validate the model against longitudinal PSA data from 16 mCRPC patients receiving adaptive AA in a pilot clinical study. Early PSA treatment response dynamics were used to predict patient response to subsequent treatment. We extended the model to incorporate metastatic burden and also investigated the survival benefit of adding concurrent chemotherapy for patients predicted to become resistant. Model simulations demonstrated PCa stem cell self-renewal as a plausible driver of resistance to adaptive therapy. Evolutionary dynamics from individual treatment cycles combined with metastatic burden measurements predicted patient response with 81% accuracy (specificity=92%, sensitivity=50%). In those patients predicted to progress, simulations of the addition of concurrent chemotherapy suggest a benefit between 1% and 11% reduction in probability of progression when compared to adaptive AA alone.

WA has several therapeutic benefits. The current study aims to identify proteins that are potentially regulated by WA in prostate cancer (PCA) cells. We used a SILAC-based proteomic approach to analyze the expression of proteins in response to WA treatment at 4 h and 24 h time points in three PCA cell lines: 22Rv1, DU-145, and LNCaP. Ontology analysis suggested that prolonged treatment with WA upregulated the expression of proteins involved in stress-response pathways. Treatment with WA increased oxidative stress, reduced global mRNA translation, and elevated the expression of cytoprotective stress granule (SG) protein G3BP1. WA treatment also enhanced the formation of SGs. The elevated expression of G3BP1 and the formation of SGs might constitute a mechanism of cytoprotection in PCA cells. Knockdown of G3BP1 blocked SG formation and enhanced the efficacy of WA to reduce PCA cell survival. SIGNIFICANCE: Withaferin A, a steroidal lactone, extracted from Withania somnifera is a promising anti-cancer drug. Using a SILAC-based quantitative proteomic approach, we identified proteins changed by WA-treatment at 4 h and 24 h in three prostate cancer (PCA) cell lines. WA-treatment induced the expression of proteins involved in apoptosis and reduced the expression of proteins involved in cell growth at 4 h. WA-treatment for 24 h enhanced the expression of proteins involved in stress response pathways. WA-treated cells exhibited increased oxidative stress, reduced mRNA translation and enhanced SG formation. PCA is characterized by higher metabolic rate and increased oxidative stress. PCA with a higher stress tolerance can effectively adapt to anti-cancer treatment stress, leading to drug resistance and cellular protection. Enhancing the level of oxidative stress along with inhibition of corresponding cytoprotective stress response pathways is a feasible option to prevent PCA from getting adapted to treatment stress. WA-treatment induced oxidative stress, in combination with blocking SGs by G3BP1 targeting, offers a therapeutic strategy to reduce PCA cell survival.""","""['Ramesh Kumar', 'Debasis Nayak', 'Syam Prakash Somasekharan']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Proteomics""","""['Evaluating anticancer properties of Withaferin A-a potent phytochemical.', 'Identification and quantitative analysis of cellular proteins affected by treatment with withaferin a using a SILAC-based proteomics approach.', 'Cytoprotective autophagy induction by withaferin A in prostate cancer cells involves GABARAPL1.', 'Proteomic characterization of Withaferin A-targeted protein networks for the treatment of monoclonal myeloma gammopathies.', 'Molecular targets and mechanisms of cancer prevention and treatment by withaferin a, a naturally occurring steroidal lactone.', 'Evaluating anticancer properties of Withaferin A-a potent phytochemical.', 'SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein interacts with immunoregulators and stress granules and phase separates to form liquid droplets.']"""

RAD9 is an oncogene for prostate cancer, and the encoded protein enhances metastasis-related phenotypes. RAD9 is a transcription factor with a limited set of regulated target genes, but the complete list of downstream genes critical for prostate carcinogenesis is unknown. We used microarray gene expression profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation in parallel to identify genes transcriptionally controlled by RAD9 that contribute to this cancer. We found expression of 44 genes altered in human prostate cancer DU145 cells when RAD9 is knocked down by siRNA, and all of them bind RAD9 at their genomic location. FOXP1 and NDRG1 were down regulated when RAD9 expression was reduced, and we evaluated them further. We demonstrate that reduced RAD9, FOXP1 or NDGR1 expression decreases cell proliferation, rapid migration, anchorage-independent growth, anoikis resistance, and aerobic glycolysis. Ectopic expression of FOXP1 or NDRG1 partially restored aerobic glycolysis to prostate cancer cells with reduced RAD9 abundance, but only FOXP1 significantly complemented the other deficiencies.

Digital rectal exam (DRE) is foundational in clinical staging of prostate cancer, even with a known limited interexaminer agreement and poor sensitivity for detecting extraprostatic disease. We sought to evaluate the prognostic value of DRE for the presence of advanced pathologic features (APFs) following radical prostatectomy (RP).  Methods:   All patients undergoing RP as primary treatment for clinically localized prostate cancer in the National Cancer Database between 2008 and 2014 were identified. Patients with additional malignancies, prior treatment with radiation or systemic therapy, incongruent clinical staging and DRE findings or without fully evaluable clinical staging were excluded. The primary outcome was the presence of postsurgical APFs, defined as positive surgical margins, nodal disease, or pathologic stage T3 or greater. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to account for prostate-specific antigen (PSA), biopsy grade group, percent of positive biopsy cores, and clinical stage.  Results:   In total, 91,525 patients consisting of 69,182 cT1, 20,641 cT2, and 1702 cT3-T4 were included. The average age was 61.1 ± 7.0 years, and the average PSA was 8.6 ± 10.3 ng/ml. On multivariable analysis, cT3 and T4 were associated with the presence of APFs (odds ratio [OR] 11.12, p < .01 and 5.28, p = .04), however, cT2 was only slightly associated with the presence of APFs when compared with cT1 (OR 1.15, p < .01). Furthermore, cT2 was associated with more node-positive disease (OR 1.63, p < .01), positive margins (OR 1.06, p < .01), and more than or equal to pT3 disease (OR 1.22, p < .01).  Conclusions:   Overall, advanced clinical stage as assessed by DRE was independently associated with an increasing risk of APFs. For individual APFs, the greatest effect is noticed between clinical stage and nodal positivity and less so between clinical stage and positive margins. DRE continues to hold value, particularly for patients with locally advanced disease and potential lymph node disease.""","""['Zachary J Prebay', 'Robert Medairos', 'Johnathan Doolittle', 'Peter Langenstroer', 'Kenneth Jacobsohn', 'William A See', 'Scott C Johnson']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Predictors of adverse pathologic features after radical prostatectomy in low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Obesity and oncological outcome after radical prostatectomy: impact of prostate-specific antigen-based prostate cancer screening: results from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital and Duke Prostate Center databases.', 'Radical prostatectomy for clinically advanced (cT3) prostate cancer since the advent of prostate-specific antigen testing: 15-year outcome.', 'Comparison of digital rectal examination and biopsy results with the radical prostatectomy specimen.', 'Is radical prostatectomy a viable therapeutic option in clinically locally advanced (cT3) prostate cancer?', 'Impact of prebiopsy MRI on prostate cancer staging: Results from the Norwegian Prostate Cancer Registry.', 'Multiparametric MRI for Staging of Prostate Cancer: A Multicentric Analysis of Predictive Factors to Improve Identification of Extracapsular Extension before Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

Loss of DNA repair proteins is associated with resistance to anti-microtubule agents. We propose that alterations in DNA damage response (DDR) pathway contribute to taxane resistance, and identification of these alterations may provide a potential therapeutic target to resensitize docetaxel-refractory mCRPC to taxane-based therapy.  Methods:   Alterations in DDR gene expression in our prostate cancer cell line model of docetaxel-resistance (DU145-DxR) derived from DU-145 cells were determined by DDR pathway-specific polymerase chain reaction array and immunoblotting. The PRKDC gene encoding DNA-PKc (DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic unit), was noted to be overexpressed and evaluated for its role in docetaxel resistance. Cell viability and clonogenic survival of docetaxel-treated DU145-DxR cells were assessed after pharmacologic inhibition of DNA-PKc with three different inhibitors-NU7441, LTURM34, and M3814. Response to second-line cytotoxic agents, cabazitaxel and etoposide upon DNA-PKc inhibition was also tested. The impact of DNA-PKc upregulation on DNA damage repair was evaluated by comet assay and analysis of double-strand breaks marker, γH2AX and Rad51. Lastly, DNA-PKc inhibitor's effect on MDR1 activity was assessed by rhodamine 123 efflux assay.  Results:   DDR pathway-specific gene profiling revealed significant upregulation of PRKDC and CDK7, and downregulation of MSH3 in DU145-DxR cells. Compared to parental DU145, DU145-DxR cells sustained significantly less DNA damage when exposed to etoposide and docetaxel. Pharmacologic inhibition of DNA-PKc, a component of NHEJ repair machinery, with all three inhibitors, significantly resensitized DU145-DxR cells to docetaxel. Furthermore, DNA-PKc inhibition also resensitized DU145-DxR to cabazitaxel and etoposide, which demonstrated cross-resistance. Inhibition of DNA-PKc led to increased DNA damage in etoposide- and docetaxel-treated DU145-DxR cells. Finally, DNA-PKc inhibition did not affect MDR1 activity, indicating that DNA-PKc inhibitors resensitized taxane-resistant cells via an MDR1-independent mechanism.  Conclusion:   This study supports a role of DDR genes, particularly, DNA-PKc in promoting resistance to taxanes in mCRPC.

Therefore, these enzymes are considered as a potential anticancer drug target. Different synthetic and natural structures have been studied as HDACs inhibitors; based on available structural design information, the capping group is important for the biological activity due to the different interactions in the active site entrance. The present study aimed to analyze high substituted pyridine as a capping group, which included carrying out the synthesis, antiproliferative activity analysis, and docking studies of these novel compounds.  Methods:   To achieve the synthesis of these derivatives, four reaction steps were performed, generating desired products 15a-k. Their effects on cell proliferation and gene expression of p21, cyclin D1, and p53 were determined using the sulphorhodamine B (SRB) method and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The HDAC1, HDAC6, and HDAC8 isoforms were used for performing docking experiments with our 15a-k products.  Result:   The products 15a-k were obtained in overall yields of 40-71%. Compounds 15j and 15k showed the highest antiproliferative activity in the breast (BT-474 and MDA-MB-231) and prostate (PC3) cancer cell lines at a concentration of 10 µM. These compounds increased p21 mRNA levels and decreased cyclin D1 and p53 gene expression. The docking study showed an increment in the strength, and in the number of interactions performed by the capping moiety of the tested molecules compared with SAHA; interactions displayed are mainly van der Waals, π-stacking, and hydrogen bond.  Conclusion:   The synthesized compounds 2-thiophene (15j) and 2-furan (15k) pyridine displayed cell growth inhibition, regulation of genes related to cell cycle progression in highly metastatic cancer cell lines.

Purpose:   To develop a multivariate prebiopsy nomogram using clinical and bpMRI parameters for estimating the probability of csPCa.  Study type:   Retrospective, single-center study.  Subjects:   Two hundred and twenty-six patients who underwent targeted biopsy (TBx) for the MRI-suspected index lesion because of clinical suspicions of PCa.  Field strength/sequence:   A 3 T MRI including turbo spin-echo T2 -weighted and diffusion-weighted single-shot echo-planar imaging sequences.  Assessment:   Prebiopsy clinical and bpMRI parameters were patient age, biopsy history (biopsy-naïve or repeated biopsy status), prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD), Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System version 2.1 (PI-RADSv2.1), and apparent diffusion coefficient ratio (ADCR). ADCR was defined as mean ADC of the index lesion divided by mean ADC of the contralateral prostatic region. A multivariate prebiopsy nomogram for csPCa (i.e. Gleason sum ≥7) was developed. Area under the curve (AUC) of each parameter and prebiopsy nomogram was assessed. Five-fold cross-validation was performed for robust estimation of performance of the prebiopsy nomogram.  Statistical tests:   Logistic regression, receiver-operating curve, and 5-fold cross-validation. P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Results:   Proportion of csPCa was 31.9% (72/226). The AUCs of age, biopsy-naïve status, PSAD, PI-RADSv2.1, ADCR, and prebiopsy nomogram were 0.657 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.580-0.733), 0.593 (95% CI, 0.525-0.660), 0.762 (95% CI, 0.697-0.826), 0.824 (95% CI, 0.770-0.878), 0.829 (95% CI, 0.769-0.888), and 0.906 (95% CI, 0.863-0.948), respectively: AUC of nomogram was significantly different than that of individual parameter. In the 5-fold cross-validation, the mean AUC of the prebiopsy nomogram for csPCa was 0.888 (95% CI, 0.786-0.983).

We conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing three SCP delivery models in two health systems. We utilize mixed methods to compare the feasibility and participants' perceived value of the three models.  Methods:   Patients completing treatment for stage I-III breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer from one urban-academic and one rural community cancer center were randomized to (1) mailed SCP, (2) SCP delivered during an in-person survivorship visit, or (3) SCP delivered during an in-person survivorship visit plus 6-month follow-up. Clinics had flexibility in intervention implementation. Quantitative data summarize intervention fidelity and protocol deviations. Qualitative interview data provide patients' perspectives on feasibility and intervention value.  Results:   Of 475 eligible participants approached, 378 (79%) were randomized. Of 345 SCPs delivered, 265 (76.8%) were by protocol. Protocol deviations were more common at the urban-academic center. In post-study qualitative interviews, participants recalled little about the SCP document or visit(s). SCPs were valued for information and care coordination, although their static nature was limiting, and sometimes SCP information differed from that provided elsewhere. Visits were opportunities for care and reassurance, but time and distance to the clinic were barriers.  Conclusions:   SCP provision was challenging. Patients were interested in SCP, but not necessarily additional survivorship visits, particularly at the urban-academic hospital.  Implications for cancer survivors:   These findings suggest that patients value careful consideration of health care needs during the transition out of treatment; SCP documents are one element of this.

Currently, the management of metastatic PCa (mPCa) remains a challenge to urologists. The analysis of hub genes and pathways may facilitate the understanding of the molecular mechanism of PCa. In the present study, to identify the hub genes in the mPCa, the three datasets GSE3325, GSE6919 and GSE38241 were downloaded from the platform of the Gene Expression Omnibus and function enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed. A total of 168 DEGs were obtained and the DEGs were significantly enriched in 'cell junction' and 'cell adhesion', among others. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that DEGs were enriched in three pathways including 'focal adhesion', 'renal cell carcinoma' and 'Hippo signaling pathway'. The results of the protein‑protein interaction network revealed that the hub genes in mPCa were separately PTEN, Rac GTPase‑activating protein 1, protein regulator of cytokinesis 1, PDZ binding kinase, centromere‑associated protein E, NUF2 component of NDC80 kinetochore complex, TPX2 microtubule nucleation factor, SOX2, CD44 and ubiquitin‑like with PHD and ring finger domains 1. As a hub gene, CD44 was differentially expressed in PCa, as determined by Oncomine analysis. Further experiments in vivo demonstrated that SB‑3CT, a selective matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor that has been reported to block CD44 cleavage and inhibit the downstream signaling pathway, suppressed the tumorigenicity of PCa cells by decreasing the expression levels of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 and 6‑phosphofructo‑2‑kinase/fructose‑2,6‑biphosphatase 4. Moreover, the combination therapy with SB‑3CT and docetaxel was more effective in inhibiting PCa compared with monotherapy. In conclusion, the identification of DEGs and the in vivo experimental results helped to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of PCa and provided a potential strategy for the treatment of PCa.""","""['Junhao Lin', 'Zhi Chen', 'Zuan Li', 'Deyong Nong', 'Ximing Li', 'Guihai Huang', 'Nan Hao', 'Jianbo Liang', 'Wei Li']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Corrigendum Screening of hub genes and evaluation of the growth regulatory role of CD44 in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Identification of key genes and pathways in castrate-resistant prostate cancer by integrated bioinformatics analysis.', 'Bioinformatics analysis identified hub genes in prostate cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis.', 'Screening and identification of key biomarkers in prostate cancer using bioinformatics.', 'Identiﬁcation of candidate biomarkers and pathways associated with SCLC by bioinformatics analysis.', 'Integrated bioinformatics analysis for differentially expressed genes and signaling pathways identification in gastric cancer.']"""

However, treating patients with low-risk mHSPC with such intensive treatment is still debatable.  Methods:   This retrospective study included 155 low-risk patients among 467 mHSPC patients treated in our affiliated institutions. The association between predictive factors and treatment outcomes was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Predictive factors for castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)-free survival were investigated using Cox regression analyses.  Results:   During the median follow-up of 39 months, 38.7% of patients developed CRPC and 14.2% died. In the multivariate analyses, a presence of Gleason pattern 5 (hazard ratio [HR] 2.04), high alkaline phosphatase (HR 1.007) and high lactate dehydrogenase (HR 1.009) were significant predictive factors for shorter CRPC-free survival. Finally, 155 patients were stratified into favorable- and unfavorable-risk groups based on the numbers of the predictive factors. The overall survival (OS) in the unfavorable-risk group (total scores: 2-3) was significantly worse than that of the favorable-risk group (total score: 0-1) (P = 0.02). This prognostic model was assessed with 50 low-risk mHSPC patients from the external validation dataset and found both the time to CRPC, and the OS in the unfavorable-risk group was significantly worse than that of the favorable-risk group (P < 0.01).

The prognostic value of TSG-alt in metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (M1-HSPC) is unknown. We evaluated the effects of TSG-alt on outcomes in M1-HSPC and their prognostic impact by first-line treatment.  Methods:   We retrospectively identified patients with M1-HSPC at our institution treated with first-line androgen deprivation therapy plus docetaxel (ADT + D) or abiraterone acetate (ADT + A). TSG-alt was defined as any alteration in one or more TSG. The main outcomes were Kaplan-Meier-estimated progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival, analyzed with the log-rank test. Clinical characteristics were compared with the χ2 test and Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test. Cox regression was used for univariate and multivariable analyses.  Results:   We identified 97 patients with M1-HSPC: 48 (49%) with ADT + A and 49 (51%) with ADT + D. Of 96 patients with data available, 33 (34%) had 1 TSG-alt, 16 (17%) had 2 TSG-alt, and 2 (2%) had 3 TSG-alt. The most common alterations were in TP53 (36%) and PTEN (31%); 6% had RB1 alterations. Median PFS was 13.1 (95% CI, 10.3-26.0) months for patients with normal TSGs (TSG-normal) vs. 7.8 (95% CI, 5.8-10.5) months for TSG-alt (P = 0.005). Median PFS was lower for patients with TSG-alt vs TSG-normal for those with ADT + A (TSG-alt: 8.0 [95% CI, 5.8-13.8] months vs. TSG-normal: 23.2 [95% CI, 13.1-not estimated] months), but not with ADT + D (TSG-alt: 7.8 [95% CI, 5.7-12.9] months vs. TSG-normal: 9.5 [95% CI, 4.8-24.7] months). On multivariable analysis, only TSG-alt predicted worse PFS (hazard ratio, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.42-3.96; P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   The presence of TSG-alt outperforms clinical criteria for predicting early progression during first-line treatment of M1-HSPC.

However, there are currently no accurate prognostic indicators of BCR in PCa. The aim of our study was to identify an autophagy-related circular RNA prognostic factor of BCR for patients with PCa. In this study, immunochemistry revealed that the classic autophagy marker MAP1LC3B was positively correlated with Gleason score. Least absolute shrinkage and selector operator regression were conducted to develop a novel prognostic model with tenfold cross-validation and an L1 penalty. Five autophagy-related circRNA signatures were included in the prognostic model. Patients with PCa were ultimately divided into high- and low-risk groups, based on the median risk score. Patients with PCa, who had a high risk score, were more likely to develop BCR in a shorter period of time. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses demonstrated that the risk score was an independent variable for predicting BCR in PCa. In addition, a prognostic nomogram integrated with the risk score and numerous clinicopathological parameters was developed to accurately predict 3- and 5-year BCR of patients with PCa. Finally, the hsa_circ_0001747 signature was selected for further experimental verification in vitro and in vivo, which showed that downregulated hsa_circ_0001747 might facilitate PCa via augmenting autophagy.

The clinical significance of high-grade tumors found on MRI but missed on systematic biopsy is open to question.  Objective:   To determine the risk of mortality for high-grade cancers identified by MRI targeting in men who had benign systematic biopsy findings.  Design, setting, and participants:   We used data from 999 men with negative systematic biopsy and concurrent MRI-targeted biopsy in the National Cancer Institute MRI study. The comparison group consisted of 3056 men followed for 11 yr after negative sextant biopsy in the European Randomized Trial of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We calculated the number of patients needed to be diagnosed (NND) and treated (NNT) following targeted biopsy in order to prevent one prostate cancer death at 11 yr. We used a simple modeling approach that involved several assumptions, such as the proportion of the deaths in ERSPC preventable by earlier detection with MRI-guided biopsy. We then varied these assumptions to assess the effects on the results.  Results and limitations:   NND and NNT were 89 and 57 for the scenario involving assumptions favorable to MRI, and 169 and 127 for a more neutral set of assumptions, respectively. Results were only more encouraging for MRI targeting under unlikely scenarios, such as 100% sensitivity for MRI and a cure rate of 100% for treatment.  Conclusions:   Although MRI may be of benefit overall, considering the decrease in overdiagnosis among men with negative MRI findings, targeting biopsy needles to MRI-detected lesions results in a large number of men diagnosed and treated per death prevented. Consideration should be given to changing guidelines on grading of MRI cores and those regarding treatment of MRI-detected high-grade prostate cancer.  Patient summary:   We carried out a modeling study to assess how magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan results used to target prostate cancer lesions during biopsy can affect outcomes. The model results show that if MRI-visible tumors are targeted during prostate biopsy, a large number of men need to be diagnosed and treated for prostate cancer in order to avoid just one prostate cancer death.""","""['Andrew J Vickers']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Corrigendum to ""Effects of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeting on Overdiagnosis and Overtreatment of Prostate Cancer"" Eur Urol 2021;80:567-72.', 'Divining Harm-Benefit Tradeoffs of Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Biopsy.', 'Re: Andrew J.

Methods:   A total of 470 prostate cancer patients who had undergone intensity-modulated radiotherapy or volumetric-modulated arc therapy were enrolled. Our model was based on FusionNet, a fully residual deep CNN developed to semantically segment biological images. To develop the CNN-based segmentation software, 450 patients were randomly selected and separated into the training, validation and testing groups (270, 90, and 90 patients, respectively). In Experiment 1, to determine the optimal model, we first assessed the segmentation accuracy according to the size of the training dataset (90, 180, and 270 patients). In Experiment 2, the effect of varying the number of training labels on segmentation accuracy was evaluated. After determining the optimal model, in Experiment 3, the developed software was used on the remaining 20 datasets to assess the segmentation accuracy. The volumetric dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and the 95th-percentile Hausdorff distance (95%HD) were calculated to evaluate the segmentation accuracy for each organ in Experiment 3.  Results:   In Experiment 1, the median DSC for the prostate were 0.61 for dataset 1 (90 patients), 0.86 for dataset 2 (180 patients), and 0.86 for dataset 3 (270 patients), respectively. The median DSCs for all the organs increased significantly when the number of training cases increased from 90 to 180 but did not improve upon further increase from 180 to 270. The number of labels applied during training had a little effect on the DSCs in Experiment 2. The optimal model was built by 270 patients and four organs. In Experiment 3, the median of the DSC and the 95%HD values were 0.82 and 3.23 mm for prostate; 0.71 and 3.82 mm for seminal vesicles; 0.89 and 2.65 mm for the rectum; 0.95 and 4.18 mm for the bladder, respectively.

The index date was the first metastatic disease diagnosis date on/after the first prostate cancer diagnosis (without prior evidence of castration resistance). Patients were observed for 12 months pre-index (baseline) through their mCSPC period (from index until castration resistance or followup end). First-line (1L) mCSPC therapy was assessed during the mCSPC period; all-cause HRU and health plan-paid costs per-patient-per-year (PPPY) were measured during baseline and mCSPC periods.  Results:   Among 6,517 COM/MA and 13,324 Medicare-FFS mCSPC patients over ∼10 months (median mCSPC period), 38% and 48% remained untreated/deferred treatment, and 45% and 46% received 1L androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) monotherapy, respectively. 1L abiraterone acetate and docetaxel were used among 7% and 6% of COM/MA and 1% and 2% of Medicare-FFS patients, respectively. HRU increased from baseline to mCSPC period, resulting in increased health plan-paid costs from $21,201 to $108,767 in COM/MA and from $16,819 to $69,639 PPPY in Medicare-FFS.  Conclusions:   This study highlights the limited use of newer therapies that improve survival in men with mCSPC in the U.S. HRU and costs increased substantially after onset of metastasis.

We aimed to identify the prognostic value of tissue expression of androgen receptor (AR), Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA), Ki-67, insulin receptors (IR) α and β, insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor, in patients with PC and to evaluate their association with diabetes. We retrospectively collected data from 360 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for PC or surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), between 2010 and 2020. We constructed tissue microarray for immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. In the final cohort (76 BPH and 284 PC), 57 (15.8%) patients had diabetes, 17 (22.37%) in BPH and 40 (14.08%) in PC (P = 0.08). IR-α was more expressed in patients with PC compared to the BPH Group (95.96% vs 4.04%; P <0.01). We found that AR was associated with increased risk of International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) score ≥4 (OR: 2.2; P <0.05), higher association with Ki-67 (OR: 2.2; P <0.05) and IR-α (OR: 5.7; P <0.05); IGF-1 receptor was associated with PSMA (OR: 2.8; P <0.05), Ki-67 (OR: 3.5; P <0.05) and IR-β (OR: 5.1; P <0.05). Finally, IGF-1 receptor was predictive of ISUP ≥ 4 (OR: 16.5; P =0.017) in patients with PC and diabetes. In the present study we highlighted how prostate cancer patients have a different protein expression in the tissue. This expression, and in particular that relating to IGF-1R, is associated with greater tumor aggressiveness in those patients with diabetes. We suppose that these results are attributable to an alteration of the insulin signal which therefore determines a greater mitogenic activity that can influence tumor progression.""","""['Giuseppe Broggi', 'Arturo Lo Giudice', 'Marina Di Mauro', 'Elisabetta Pricoco', 'Eliana Piombino', 'Matteo Ferro', 'Rosario Caltabiano', 'Giuseppe Morgia', 'Giorgio Ivan Russo']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Transl Res""","""['SRSF-1 and microvessel density immunohistochemical analysis by semi-automated tissue microarray in prostate cancer patients with diabetes (DIAMOND study).', 'Androgen receptor overexpression in prostate cancer in type 2 diabetes.', 'The proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, induces prostate cancer cell death by suppressing the expression of prostate-specific membrane antigen, as well as androgen receptor.', 'Interaction of IGF signaling and the androgen receptor in prostate cancer progression.', 'Insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF-1R) signaling systems: novel treatment strategies for cancer.', 'Emerging Role of IGF-1 in Prostate Cancer: A Promising Biomarker and Therapeutic Target.', 'Is There a Role of Warburg Effect in Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness?

Multifocal HGPIN in needle biopsies in the absence of PCa indicates a higher risk of cancer detection in subsequent biopsies. Therefore, a reliable diagnosis of HGPIN is of high clinical relevance guiding the management of patients with cancer-negative biopsies. Detection of HGPIN is merely based on morphological features while biomarkers aiding in the diagnosis of HGPIN and its differentiation from benign glands and other glandular lesions are lacking yet. Here, we investigated the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 19 (CDK19) by immunohistochemistry on prostate needle biopsies of 140 patients who were all diagnosed with PCa using whole-tissue sections and compared CDK19 levels between HGPIN, PCa, and adjacent benign glands. In addition, CDK19 was compared with AMACR expression in a subset of intraductal carcinomas (IDCs) on radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens. HGPIN was present in 65.7% of biopsies and in 88% associated to adjacent PCa. CDK19 overexpression defined as moderate to high CDK19 expression visible at low magnification was found in 82.6% of HGPIN. In contrast, 89.3% of benign glands were CDK19-negative or demonstrated only low CDK19 expression highlighting a high sensitivity and specificity to accurately detect HGPIN based on CDK19 expression levels. CDK19 was overexpressed in 59% of PCa but did not correlate significantly with the expression of intermingled HGPIN. On RP, CDK19 and AMACR showed no significant difference in the detection rate of IDC. In summary, assessment of CDK19 facilitates accurate and simplified diagnosis of HGPIN with high sensitivity and specificity and aides the differentiation to non-neoplastic glandular alterations. Considering the high clinical significance of diagnosis HGPIN that still has a limited reproducibility among pathologists, we suggest CDK19 as diagnostic biomarker for HGPIN.""","""['Anne Offermann', 'Vincent Joerg', 'Marie C Hupe', 'Finn Becker', 'Marten Müller', 'Johannes Brägelmann', 'Jutta Kirfel', 'Axel S Merseburger', 'Verena Sailer', 'Lars Tharun', 'Sven Perner']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Hum Pathol""","""['Expression of ERG protein, a prostate cancer specific marker, in high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN): lack of utility to stratify cancer risks associated with HGPIN.', 'ERG overexpression and multifocality predict prostate cancer in subsequent biopsy for patients with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.', 'Positive predictive value of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia in initial core needle biopsies of prostate adenocarcinoma--a study with complete sampling of hemi-prostates with corresponding negative biopsy findings.', 'In situ and intraductal epithelial proliferations of prostate: definitions and treatment implications.

ERG expression promotes prostate tumor formation and luminal epithelial cell fates when combined with PI3K/AKT pathway activation, however the mechanism of synergy is not known. In contrast to luminal fates, expression of ERG alone in immortalized normal prostate epithelial cells promotes cell migration and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Migration requires ERG serine 96 phosphorylation via endogenous Ras/ERK signaling. We found that a phosphomimetic mutant, S96E ERG, drove tumor formation and clonogenic survival without activated AKT. S96 was only phosphorylated on nuclear ERG, and differential recruitment of ERK to a subset of ERG-bound chromatin associated with ERG-activated, but not ERG-repressed genes. S96E did not alter ERG genomic binding, but caused a loss of ERG-mediated repression, EZH2 binding and H3K27 methylation. In contrast, AKT activation altered the ERG cistrome and promoted expression of luminal cell fate genes. These data suggest that, depending on AKT status, ERG can promote either luminal or EMT transcription programs, but ERG can promote tumorigenesis independent of these cell fates and tumorigenesis requires only the transcriptional activation function.""","""['Brady G Strittmatter', 'Travis J Jerde', 'Peter C Hollenhorst']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""PLoS Genet""","""['The Expression of Proto-Oncogene ETS-Related Gene (ERG) Plays a Central Role in the Oncogenic Mechanism Involved in the Development and Progression of Prostate Cancer.', 'Phosphorylation of the oncogenic transcription factor ERG in prostate cells dissociates polycomb repressive complex 2, allowing target gene activation.', 'Snail promotes cell migration through PI3K/AKT-dependent Rac1 activation as well as PI3K/AKT-independent pathways during prostate cancer progression.', 'Prostate cancer ETS rearrangements switch a cell migration gene expression program from RAS/ERK to PI3K/AKT regulation.', 'A minireview: the role of MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways in thyroid follicular cell-derived neoplasm.', 'DeeP4med: deep learning for P4 medicine to predict normal and cancer transcriptome in multiple human tissues.', 'IPO5 Mediates EMT and Promotes Esophageal Cancer Development through the RAS-ERK Pathway.', 'From Omics to Multi-Omics Approaches for In-Depth Analysis of the Molecular Mechanisms of Prostate Cancer.', 'The Expression of Proto-Oncogene ETS-Related Gene (ERG) Plays a Central Role in the Oncogenic Mechanism Involved in the Development and Progression of Prostate Cancer.', 'Past, Current, and Future Strategies to Target ERG Fusion-Positive Prostate Cancer.']"""

Results:   BCR was confirmed after RARP in 61 patients (14.0%), and PSM was confirmed in 74 patients (17.0%); PSM was a significant predictor of BCR (p < 0.001). The median number of PSMs was 2 (1-6), and the median maximum length of PSM was 6.0 (2.0-17.0) mm.

A major disadvantage is overdiagnosis, whereby lesions are identified that would not have become evident during the man's lifetime if screening had not taken place. The present study aims to estimate the rate of overdiagnosis using Finnish data from the European randomized trial of prostate cancer screening.  Methods:   We used data from 80,149 men randomized to a screening or a control group, distinguishing four birth cohorts. We used the ""catch-up method"" to identify when the difference in the cumulative incidence of prostate cancer between the screening and control groups had stabilized, implying that the screening has no further effect. We define the overdiagnosis rate to be the relative excess cumulative incidence in the screened group at that point. As an independent method, we also examined the diagnosis rates of T1c tumors as an indicator of early tumors detected by PSA.  Results:   The estimates of overdiagnosis rates from the catch-up method using the full period of available follow-up ranged between cohorts from 2.3% to 15.4%, and the T1c analysis gave very similar results.  Conclusion:   Some overdiagnosis has occurred, but there is uncertainty about its extent. A long follow-up is required to demonstrate the full impact of screening. We evaluated the overdiagnosis rates at a population level, associated with being offered screening, taking account of contamination (screening among the controls). The overall evaluation of screening should incorporate mortality benefit, cost-effectiveness, and quality of life.""","""['S D Walter', 'Jiarui Hu', 'Kirsi Talala', 'Teuvo Tammela', 'Kimmo Taari', 'Anssi Auvinen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['Opportunistic testing versus organized prostate-specific antigen screening: outcome after 18 years in the Göteborg randomized population-based prostate cancer screening trial.', 'Number of Screening Rounds and Postscreening Prostate Cancer Incidence: Results from the Finnish Section of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer Study.', 'Screening for prostate cancer.', 'Detection of prostate cancer: the impact of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC).', 'Prostate cancer mortality in the Finnish randomized screening trial.']"""

VarSAn analyzes a configurable network whose nodes represent variants, genes and pathways, using a Random Walk with Restarts algorithm to rank pathways for relevance to the given variants, and reports P-values for pathway relevance. It treats non-coding and coding variants differently, properly accounts for the number of pathways impacted by each variant and identifies relevant pathways even if many variants do not directly impact genes of the pathway. We use VarSAn to identify pathways relevant to variants related to cancer and several other diseases, as well as drug response variation. We find VarSAn's pathway ranking to be complementary to the standard approach of enrichment tests on genes related to the query set. We adopt a novel benchmarking strategy to quantify its advantage over this baseline approach.

Exosomal circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been reported to function in PCa progression. The current study aimed to investigate the role of exosomal circRNA homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 3 (circHIPK3) in PCa development. Exosomes were extracted from serum and cells utilizing commercial kit, and identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Western blot assay and nanoparticle tracking analyzer. Relative expression of circHIPK3, microRNA (miR)-212 and B-cell specific MMLV insertion site-1 (BMI-1) was examined by quantitative realtime PCR or Western blot assay. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to assess the diagnostic potential of exosomal miR-212. Cell viability, and metastasis including migration and invasion, were detected by Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay and Transwell assay, respectively. Cell apoptosis was monitored using flow cytometry. The interaction between miR-212 and circHIPK3 or BMI-1 was validated by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Xenograft tumor assay was employed to explore the role of exosomal circHIPK3 in vivo. Exosomal circHIPK3 was increased in serum of PCa patients, and could discriminate PCa patients from normal volunteers. Depletion of exosomal circHIPK3 or overexpression of exosomal miR-212 reduced viability, migration and invasion, but promoted cell apoptosis in PCa cells, which was attenuated by miR-212 inhibition or BMI-1, respectively. MiR-212 targeted BMI-1, and downregulated BMI-1 expression. Exosomal circHIPK3 knockdown also suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Exosomal circHIPK3 knockdown inhibited PCa progression by regulating miR-212/BMI-1 axis, at least in part, offering a new insight into the molecular mechanism of PCa.""","""['Yanhui Tang', 'Junxiang Liu', 'Xilan Li', 'Wenbin Wang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Biosci""","""['Circular RNA circHIPK3 modulates prostate cancer progression via targeting miR-448/MTDH signaling.', 'Exosomal circRNA Scm-like with four malignant brain tumor domains 2 (circ-SFMBT2) enhances the docetaxel resistance of prostate cancer via the microRNA-136-5p/tribbles homolog 1 pathway.', 'Exosomal Circ-XIAP Promotes Docetaxel Resistance in Prostate Cancer by Regulating miR-1182/TPD52 Axis.', 'Roles and clinical application of exosomal circRNAs in the diagnosis and treatment of malignant tumors.', 'Exosomal noncoding RNAs in prostate cancer.', 'Dynamic Role of Exosome microRNAs in Cancer Cell Signaling and Their Emerging Role as Noninvasive Biomarkers.', 'Regulatory mechanisms and clinical applications of tumor-driven exosomal circRNAs in cancers.', 'Understanding the Dual Roles of CircHIPK3 in Tumorigenesis and Tumor Progression.', 'The Diagnostic and Therapeutic Role of Circular RNA HIPK3 in Human Diseases.', 'The Crucial Roles of Bmi-1 in Cancer: Implications in Pathogenesis, Metastasis, Drug Resistance, and Targeted Therapies.']"""

A criterion to fail a PBS-QA measurement is having a <95% passing rate in a 3.0%-3.0 mm gamma index analysis. Clinically, we use a two-dimensional (2D) gamma index analysis to obtain the passing rate. The IBA MatriXX PT 2D detection array with finite size ionization chamber was utilized. A total of 2488 measurements performed in our PBS beamline were cataloged. The percentage of measurements for the sites of head/neck, breast, prostate, and other are 53.3%, 22.7%, 10.5%, and 13.5%, respectively. The measurements with a passing rate of 100 to >94%, 94 to >88%, and <88% were 93.6%, 5.6%, and 0.8%, respectively. The percentage of failed measurements with a <95% passing rate was 10.9%. After removed the user errors of either re-measurement or re-analysis, 8.1% became acceptable. We observed a feature of >3% per mm dose gradient with respect to depth on the failed measurements. We utilized a 2D/three-dimensional (3D) gamma index analysis toolkit to investigate the effect of depth dose gradient. By utilizing this 3D toolkit, 43.1% of the failed measurements were improved. A feature among measurements that remained sub-optimal after re-analysis was a sharp >3% per mm lateral dose gradient that may not be well handled using the detector size of 5.0 mm in-diameter. An analysis of the sampling of finite size detectors using one-dimensional (1D) error function showed a large dose deviation at locations of low-dose areas between two high-dose plateaus. User error, large depth dose gradient, and the effect of detector size are identified as root causes. With the mitigation of the root causes, the goals of patient-specific QA, specifically detecting actual deviation of beam delivery or identifying limitations of the dose calculation algorithm of the treatment planning system, can be directly related to failure of the PBS-QA measurements.""","""['Jacob C Ricci', 'Wen C Hsi', 'Zhong Su', 'Karl Mund', 'Robert Dawson', 'Daniel J Indelicato']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['A 2D strip ionization chamber array with high spatiotemporal resolution for proton pencil beam scanning FLASH radiotherapy.', 'Three-dimensional gamma criterion for patient-specific quality assurance of spot scanning proton beams.', 'Design of a QA method to characterize submillimeter-sized PBS beam properties using a 2D ionization chamber array.', 'Use of a novel two-dimensional ionization chamber array for pencil beam scanning proton therapy beam quality assurance.', 'Towards effective and efficient patient-specific quality assurance for spot scanning proton therapy.']"""

We performed a critical appraisal of the association between the number of positive prostate biopsy cores and CSM in high versus very high-risk PCa.  Methods:   Within Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2010-2016), 13,836 high versus 20,359 very high-risk PCa patients were identified. Discrimination according to 11 different positive prostate biopsy core cut-offs (≥2-≥12) were tested in Kaplan-Meier, cumulative incidence, and multivariable Cox and competing risks regression models.  Results:   Among 11 tested positive prostate biopsy core cut-offs, more than or equal to 8 (high-risk vs. very high-risk: n = 18,986 vs. n = 15,209, median prostate-specific antigen [PSA]: 10.6 vs. 16.8 ng/ml, <.001) yielded optimal discrimination and was closely followed by the established more than or equal to 5 cut-off (high-risk vs. very high-risk: n = 13,836 vs. n = 20,359, median PSA: 16.5 vs. 11.1 ng/ml, p < .001).

We recently characterized two mCRPC phenotypes with NE features: androgen receptor (AR)-positive NE-positive amphicrine prostate cancer (AMPC) and AR-negative small cell or neuroendocrine prostate cancer (SCNPC). Here, we interrogated the regulation of RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST), a transcriptional repressor of neuronal genes, and elucidated molecular programs driving AMPC and SCNPC biology. Analysis of prostate cancer cell lines, mCRPC specimens, and LuCaP patient-derived xenograft models detected alternative splicing of REST to REST4 and attenuated REST repressor activity in AMPC and SCNPC. The REST locus was also hypermethylated and REST expression was reduced in SCNPC. While serine/arginine repetitive matrix protein 4 (SRRM4) was previously implicated in alternative splicing of REST in mCRPC, we detected SRRM3 expression in REST4-positive, SRRM4-negative AMPC, and SCNPC. In CRPC cell lines, SRRM3 induced alternative splicing of REST to REST4 and exacerbated the expression of REST-repressed genes. Furthermore, SRRM3 and SRRM4 expression defined molecular subsets of AMPC and SCNPC across species and tumor types. Two AMPC phenotypes and three SCNPC phenotypes were characterized, denoted either by REST attenuation and ASCL1 activity or by progressive activation of neuronal transcription factor programs, respectively. These results nominate SRRM3 as the principal REST splicing factor expressed in early NE differentiation and provide a framework to molecularly classify diverse NE phenotypes in mCRPC.

However, the transcriptional changes associated with PTEN loss in PCa have not been described in detail. In this study, we highlight the transcriptional changes associated with PTEN loss in PCa.  Methods:   Using a meta-analysis approach, we leveraged two large PCa cohorts with experimentally validated PTEN and ERG status by Immunohistochemistry (IHC), to derive a transcriptomic signature of PTEN loss, while also accounting for potential confounders due to ERG rearrangements. This signature was expanded to lncRNAs using the TCGA quantifications from the FC-R2 expression atlas.  Results:   The signatures indicate a strong activation of both innate and adaptive immune systems upon PTEN loss, as well as an expected activation of cell-cycle genes. Moreover, we made use of our recently developed FC-R2 expression atlas to expand this signature to include many non-coding RNAs recently annotated by the FANTOM consortium. Highlighting potential novel lncRNAs associated with PTEN loss and PCa progression.  Conclusion:   We created a PCa specific signature of the transcriptional landscape of PTEN loss that comprises both the coding and an extensive non-coding counterpart, highlighting potential new players in PCa progression.

Multiple fluorescein-tagged hybridization assistant probes are used to promote the selective capture of this long noncoding RNA, and sensitivity by incorporating multiple redox enzymes per target molecule, after addition of antifluorescein Fab fragment-peroxidase conjugate. This strategy alleviates the problems associated with the low natural abundance of this marker, its large size, and complex secondary structure. The individual genosensors exhibit good sensitivity (2.48 ± 0.01 μA nM-1 and 6.4 ± 0.3 μA nM-1 for PCA3 and PSA, respectively), with wide linear ranges (from 25 pM to 10 nM for PCA3 and 1 nM for PSA), and detection limits in the low picomolar range (4.4 pM and 1.5 pM for PCA3 and PSA, respectively). This analytical performance is retained in the dual configuration without significant cross-talk, despite using the same enzyme label. The usefulness of this dual platform was demonstrated by analyzing RNA extracts from the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP and from urine samples of prostate cancer patients.""","""['Raquel Sánchez-Salcedo', 'Rebeca Miranda-Castro', 'Noemí de-Los-Santos-Álvarez', 'María Jesús Lobo-Castañón']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Biosens Bioelectron""","""['Detection of the Prostate Cancer Biomarker PCA3 with Electrochemical and Impedance-Based Biosensors.', 'Combination of Prostate Cancer Antigen 3 and Prostate-Specific Antigen Improves Diagnostic Accuracy in Men at Risk of Prostate Cancer.', 'PSGR and PCA3 as biomarkers for the detection of prostate cancer in urine.', 'Contemporary role of prostate cancer antigen 3 in the management of prostate cancer.', 'Urinary Prostate Cancer Antigen 3 as a Tumour Marker: Biochemical and Clinical Aspects.', 'Plumbing mysterious RNAs in ""dark genome"" for the conquest of human diseases.', 'A five-pseudouridylation-associated-LncRNA classifier for primary prostate cancer prognosis prediction.', 'Tracking a Major Egg Allergen to Assess Commercial Food Label Compliance: Towards a Simple and Fast Immunosensing Device.', 'Sequence-Specific Electrochemical Genosensor for Rapid Detection of blaOXA-51-like Gene in Acinetobacter baumannii.', 'Blood-derived lncRNAs as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis: the Good, the Bad and the Beauty.']"""

We aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of second-generation androgen receptor inhibitors in men aged 80 years or older with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.  Methods:   We searched for all randomised controlled clinical trials evaluating second-generation androgen receptor inhibitors in patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration before Aug 15, 2020, and pooled data from three trials that met the selection criteria. All three trials enrolled patients who were aged 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, castration-resistant prostate cancer, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 2·0 μg/L or greater, PSA doubling time of 10 months or less, and no evidence of distant metastatic disease on conventional imaging per the investigator's assessment at the time of screening. All patients had histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate without neuroendocrine differentiation or small-cell features. All patients who were randomly assigned to androgen receptor inhibitor or placebo groups in these trials were considered assessable and were included in this pooled analysis. We evaluated the effect of age on metastasis-free survival and overall survival across age groups (<80 years vs ≥80 years) in the intention-to-treat population. Safety analyses were done in patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.  Findings:   Between Oct 14, 2013, and March 9, 2018, 4117 patients were assigned to androgen receptor inhibitor (apalutamide, enzalutamide, or daralutamide; n=2694) or placebo (n=1423) across three randomised trials. The median follow-up duration for metastasis-free survival was 18 months (IQR 11-26) and for overall survival was 44 months (32-55). In patients aged 80 years or older (n=1023), the estimated median metastasis-free survival was 40 months (95% CI 36-41) in the androgen receptor inhibitor groups and 22 months (18-29) in the placebo groups (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0·37 [95% CI 0·28-0·47]), and the median overall survival was 54 months (50-61) versus 49 months (43-58), respectively (adjusted HR 0·79 [0·64-0·98]). In patients younger than 80 years of age (n=3094), the estimated median metastasis-free survival was 41 months (95% CI 36-not estimable [NE]) in the androgen receptor inhibitor groups and 16 months (15-18) in the placebo groups (adjusted HR 0·31 [95% CI 0·27-0·35]), and the median overall survival was 74 months (74-NE) versus 61 months (56-NE), respectively (adjusted HR 0·69 [0·60-0·80]). In patients aged 80 years or older, grade 3 or worse adverse events were reported in 371 (55%) of 672 patients in the androgen receptor inhibitor groups and 140 (41%) of 344 patients in the placebo groups, compared with 878 (44%) of 2015 patients in the androgen receptor inhibitor groups and 321 (30%) of 1073 patients in the placebo groups among patients younger than 80 years. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were hypertension (168 [8%] of 2015 patients aged <80 years and 51 [8%] of 672 patients aged ≥80 years in the androgen receptor inhibitor groups vs 53 [5%] of 1073 patients aged <80 years and 22 [6%] of 344 patients aged ≥80 years in the placebo groups) and fracture (61 [3%] and 36 [5%] in the androgen receptor inhibitor groups vs 15 [1%] and 11 [3%] in the placebo groups).  Interpretation:   The findings of this pooled analysis support the use of androgen receptor inhibitors in older men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Incorporating geriatric assessment tools in the care of older adults with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer might help clinicians to offer individualised treatment to each patient.

This study estimated incidence proportions and incidence rates of ONJ in cancer patients with bone metastases from solid tumors treated for the prevention of skeletal-related events in routine clinical practice.  Methods:   This cohort study in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden in 2011-2018 included 3 treatment cohorts: a denosumab inception cohort (DEIC), a zoledronic acid inception cohort (ZAIC), and a denosumab-switch cohort (DESC). The authors estimated 1- to 5-year incidence proportions and incidence rates of ONJ overall, by cancer site (breast, prostate, or other solid tumor), and by country. ONJ diagnoses were confirmed by adjudication.  Results:   There were 1340 patients in the DEIC, 1352 in the ZAIC, and 408 in the DESC. The median ages of the 3 cohorts were 70, 69, and 70 years, respectively; the proportions of men were 72.6%, 53.8%, and 48.3%, respectively; and the median follow-up was 19.8, 12.9, and 13.3 months, respectively. The 5-year incidence proportions of ONJ were 5.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.4%-7.3%) in the DEIC, 1.4% (95% CI, 0.8%-2.3%) in the ZAIC, and 6.6% (95% CI, 4.2%-10.0%) in the DESC. The corresponding ONJ incidence rates per 100 person-years were 3.0 (95% CI, 2.3-3.7), 1.0 (95% CI, 0.6-1.5), and 4.3 (95% CI, 2.8-6.3). Incidence proportions and incidence rates were highest in patients with prostate cancer and in Denmark.  Conclusions:   This study provides estimates of the risk of medically confirmed ONJ among patients initiating denosumab or zoledronic acid in routine clinical practice in 3 Scandinavian countries. The results varied by cancer site and by country.  Lay summary:   Denosumab and zoledronic acid reduce the risk of bone fractures, pain, and surgery in patients with advanced cancers involving bone. Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ)-death of a jawbone-is a known side effect of treatment with denosumab or zoledronic acid. The authors examined almost 2900 denosumab- or zoledronic acid-treated patients with cancer in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Over the course of 5 years, ONJ developed in 5.7% of the patients whose initial treatment was denosumab, in 1.4% of the patients whose initial treatment was zoledronic acid, and in 6.6% of the patients who switched from zoledronic acid to denosumab.""","""['Vera Ehrenstein', 'Uffe Heide-Jørgensen', 'Morten Schiødt', 'Olof Akre', 'Bente Brokstad Herlofson', 'Svein Hansen', 'Cecilia Larsson Wexell', 'Sven Erik Nørholt', 'Steinar Tretli', 'Anders Kjellman', 'Anthony Glennane', 'Kimberly A Lowe', 'Henrik T Sørensen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Bisphosphonates or RANK-ligand-inhibitors for men with prostate cancer and bone metastases: a network meta-analysis.', 'Incidence of osteonecrosis of the jaw in patients with bone metastases treated sequentially with bisphosphonates and denosumab.', 'Osteonecrosis of the Jaw in Patients Receiving Bone-Targeted Therapies: An Overview--Part I.', 'Incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of osteonecrosis of the jaw: integrated analysis from three blinded active-controlled phase III trials in cancer patients with bone metastases.', 'Bisphosphonates and other bone agents for breast cancer.', 'Long-term use of denosumab and its association with skeletal-related events and osteonecrosis of the jaw.', 'Leukocyte and platelet rich fibrin in the management of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The Dietary and Non-Dietary Management of Osteoporosis in Adult-Onset Celiac Disease: Current Status and Practical Guidance.', 'Real-world study of antiresorptive-related osteonecrosis of jaw based on the US food and drug administration adverse event reporting system database.', 'Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Caused by Denosumab in Treatment-Naïve and Pre-Treatment with Zoledronic Acid Groups: A Time-to-Onset Study Using the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) Database.']"""

Temsirolimus (CCI-779), a selective inhibitor of the mTOR, is an ester analog of rapamycin (sirolimus) with improved aqueous solubility and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties. Preclinical studies have confirmed additive and synergistic antitumor activity in cancer cell lines (breast, prostate cancer) with combinations of taxanes and mTOR inhibitors. We conducted a phase I open-label, dose-escalation study to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of docetaxel in combination with temsirolimus in patients with refractory solid tumors.  Patients and methods:   Eligible patients had a diagnosis of a refractory solid malignancy, measurable disease, and adequate organ function. Patients were sequentially enrolled in 4 dose level intravenous combinations of docetaxel and temsirolimus. Temsirolimus was administered weekly with docetaxel administered every 3 weeks. Laboratory data for tumor markers and radiologic imaging were conducted prestudy and then after every 2 cycles of the treatment. Radiologic response was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Blood samples for PK and pharmacodynamic analysis were planned to be drawn at MTD. Apart from the traditional 3+3 design, we also implemented Bayesian Optimal Interval design which uses isotonic regression method to select MTD. We proceeded with isotonic regression analysis by using 20% dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate as target.  Results:   Twenty-six patients were treated in this study in 4 cohorts and dose levels. Fourteen males and 12 females were enrolled with a median age of 50 years (range of 27 to 72 y) and median Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 1. Tumor histologies included pancreas (6), colon (5), rectum (3), gallbladder (2), non-small cell lung (2), endometrium (1), neuroendocrine (1), esophagus (1), stomach (1), pharynx (1), small intestine (1), and duodenum (1). Stable disease was observed in 2/4 (50%), 3/7 (43%), 4/10 (40%), and 3/5 (60%) patients in cohorts 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Dose escalation in cohorts 2, 3, and 4 was complicated by DLTs such as grade 4 neutropenia and grade 3 diarrhea and an inability for patients to tolerate treatments during and beyond cycle 1 without dose reductions. Therefore, we could not determine an MTD or recommended phase II dose using the traditional 3+3 study analysis. Blood samples for PK and pharmacodynamic analysis were not collected since MTD was not determined. By using 20% DLT rate closest to the target, isotonic regression analysis showed identical estimated DLT rates in dose -1 (docetaxel 50 mg/m2 and temsirolimus 15 mg/m2) and dose level 1 (docetaxel 60mg/m2 and temsirolimus 15 mg/m2).  Conclusions:   Dose escalation of docetaxel and temsirolimus was limited by severe myelosuppressive toxicity in this phase I study. Most of the DLTs occurred after cycle 1 of therapy hence, we were unable to determine MTD or collect blood samples for PK and pharmacodynamic analysis. Our trial did not meet its objectives due to significant DLTs with this chemotherapy combination. Although our novel use of Bayesian Optimal Interval design using isotonic regression method to select MTD showed identical estimated DLT rates in dose levels 1 and -1, clinically our patients were not able to complete 2 cycles of this regimen without dose reductions due to myelosuppressive toxicity in either of these dose levels, and hence, escaped clinical validity.

We report the long-term results in intermediate-risk patients treated with 74 or 78 Gy EBRT, as per current guidelines.  Patient and methods:   Of 819 patients randomly assigned between EBRT or EBRT plus AS started on day 1 of EBRT, 481 entered with intermediate risk (International Union Against Cancer TNM 1997 cT1b-c or T2a with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≥ 10 ng/mL or Gleason ≤ 7 and PSA ≤ 20 ng/mL, N0M0) and had EBRT planned at 74 (342 patients, 71.1%) or 78 Gy (139 patients, 28.9%). We report the trial primary end point EFS, DFS, distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and overall survival (OS) by intention-to-treat stratified by EBRT dose at two-sided α = 5%.  Results:   At a median follow-up of 12.2 years, 92 of 245 patients and 132 of 236 had EFS events in the EBRT plus AS and EBRT arm, respectively, mostly PSA relapse (48.7%) or death (45.1%).

Patients and methods:   Between 2002 and 2019, we identified 2431 patients with paired biopsy and RP histopathology from a prospectively recorded and maintained prostate cancer database. Biopsy specimens were graded according to the 2005 GS or ISUP 2014 modified system, according to the year of diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to retrospectively assess the impact of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), PSA density, age, pre-biopsy mpMRI, and biopsy method, on the rate of upgraded disease. The kappa coefficient was used to establish the degree of change in concordance between groups.  Results:   Overall, 24% of patients had upgraded disease and 8% of patients had downgraded disease when using the modified ISUP 2014 criteria. Agreement in the updated ISUP 2014 cohort was 68%, compared with 55% in the 2005 GS group, which was validated by a kappa coefficient that was good (k = 0.5 ± 0.4) and poor (k = 0.3 ± 0.1), respectively. In multivariable models, a change in grading system independently improved overall disease concordance (P = 0.02), and there were no other co-segregated patient or pathological factors such as PSA, total number of cores, maximum cancer length, biopsy route or the use of mpMRI that impacted this finding.

Methods:   Whole-body planar images acquired at immediately, 4 and 24 h after 177Lu-PSMA I&T injection (range 4.44-8.51 GBq) were collected from 12 treatment cycles of 8 prostate cancer patients. Region of interests (ROIs) were manually contoured on the whole-body, liver, spleen, urinary bladder, lacrimal glands, parotid, and submandibular glands to determine time-integrated activity (TIA) in source organs and fitted time-activity curves using mono-exponential extrapolation. The S values calculated utilizing non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) computational phantoms were extracted from the OLINDA/EXM v. 2.0 to calculate the absorbed dose coefficient in target organs according to the Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) scheme. The absorbed doses to bone marrow were estimated using the planar two-compartment image-based method by separating the high-uptake and low-uptake compartment. The spherical model was used to calculate the lacrimal gland absorbed doses.  Results:   Mean absorbed dose coefficients to the kidneys, bone marrow, liver, urinary bladder, spleen, lacrimal glands, parotid, and submandibular glands were 0.81 ± 0.24, 0.02 ± 0.01, 0.13 ± 0.10, 0.27 ± 0.25, 0.16 ± 0.07, 3.62 ± 1.78, 0.21 ± 0.14, and 0.09 ± 0.07 Gy/GBq, respectively. Dose constraints for the kidneys (23 Gy) and bone marrow (2 Gy) were not reached in any patients. The absorbed dose in lacrimal glands calculated by the NURBS computational phantoms was slightly lower than the calculation based on the Cristy-Eckerman computational phantoms using OLINDA/EXM v. 1.0 by 6.37 ± 0.14%.

It can have a substantial impact on men and their partners and is associated with increased psychological morbidity. Despite this, sexual concerns are often not adequately addressed in routine practice. Evidence-based web-based interventions have the potential to provide ongoing information and sexual well-being support throughout all stages of care.  Objective:   The aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of a web-based self-management intervention designed to maximize sexual well-being in men living with prostate cancer and explore user perspectives on usability and acceptability.  Methods:   We used a single-arm study design, and participants were provided with access to the 5-step intervention for a period of 3 months. The intervention content was tailored based on responses to brief screening questions on treatment type, relationship status, and sexual orientation. Efficacy was assessed by using two-tailed, paired sample t tests for comparing the mean differences between pre- and postintervention measurements for exploring the participants' self-reported knowledge and understanding, sexual satisfaction, and comfort in discussing sexual issues. Usability and acceptability were determined based on the program use data and a postintervention survey for exploring perceived usefulness.  Results:   A total of 109 participants were recruited for this study. Significant postintervention improvements at follow-up were observed in the total scores (out of 20) from the survey (mean 12.23/20 points, SD 2.46 vs mean 13.62/20, SD 2.31; t88=9.570; P=.001) as well as in individual item scores on the extent to which the participants agreed that they had sufficient information to manage the impact that prostate cancer had on their sex life (mean 2.31/4 points, SD 0.86 vs mean 2.57/4, SD 0.85; t88=3.660; P=.001) and had the potential to have a satisfying sex life following treatment (mean 2.38/4 points, SD 0.79 vs mean 3.17/4, SD 0.78; t88=7.643; P=.001). The median number of intervention sessions was 3 (range 1-11), and intervention sessions had a median duration of 22 minutes (range 8-77). Acceptable usability scores were reported, with the highest result observed for the question on the extent to which the intervention provided relevant information.  Conclusions:   This study provides evidence on the efficacy of a tailored web-based intervention for maximizing sexual well-being in men living with prostate cancer. The results indicate that the intervention may improve one's self-perceived knowledge and understanding of how to manage sexual issues and increase self-efficacy or the belief that a satisfactory sex life could be achieved following treatment. The findings will be used to refine the intervention content before testing as part of a larger longitudinal study for examining its effectiveness.""","""[""Sean R O'Connor"", 'Carrie Flannagan', 'Kader Parahoo', 'Mary Steele', 'Samantha Thompson', 'Suneil Jain', 'Michael Kirby', 'Nuala Brady', 'Roma Maguire', 'John Connaghan', 'Eilis M McCaughan']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Med Internet Res""","""['TrueNTH sexual recovery study protocol: a multi-institutional collaborative approach to developing and testing a web-based intervention for couples coping with the side-effects of prostate cancer treatment in a randomized controlled trial.', 'Feasibility, Acceptability, and Preliminary Impacts of Web-Based Patient Education on Patients With Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder: Quasi-Experimental Cluster Study.', 'Feasibility and Acceptability of a Remotely Delivered, Web-Based Behavioral Intervention for Men With Prostate Cancer: Four-Arm Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial.', 'Psychosocial interventions for men with prostate cancer.', 'Psychosocial interventions for men with prostate cancer: a Cochrane systematic review.', 'Marital status and perceived stress in men with advanced prostate cancer: A randomized-controlled trial of cognitive behavioral stress management.', 'Effects of a Brief E-Learning Resource on Sexual Attitudes and Beliefs of Healthcare Professionals Working in Prostate Cancer Care: A Pilot Study.']"""

Cancer cells overexpress certain biomarkers that can be exploited for their targeted therapy. Cyclic cell-penetrating peptides (cCPP) are increasingly assessed for intracellular cargo delivery in cancer cells. In this study, we have conjugated cabazitaxel (CBT) to the cCPP via an ester bond to assist CBT release in the tumor's acidic environment. Integrin targeting (RGDC, TP1) and extra domain B of fibronectin (EDB-Fn) targeting (CTVRTSAD, TP2) peptides were linked to the peptide-drug conjugate (cCPP-CBT) via a disulfide bond to provide targeting ability to the conjugates until they reach the tumor site. Conjugate 11 (TP1-cCPP-CBT) and conjugate 16 (TP2-cCPP-CBT) showed approximately 3-4-fold less antiproliferative activity on integrin and EDB-FN overexpressing cancer cell lines as compared to the CBT analogue used for comparison (CBT-GA, 5). Conjugates (11 and 16) were less toxic (31-34-fold less antiproliferative activity) to the normal human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells as compared to CBT. The flow cytometry and quantitative confocal microscopy data further confirm the selective efficacy of conjugates (TP1-cCPP-FAM (10) and TP1-cCPP-FAM (15)) toward biomarker overexpressing cancer cells. Furthermore, the stability and release studies of conjugate 11 revealed its therapeutic potential under different conditions, such as human plasma, different pHs, and redox conditions.

The updated results with final overall survival (OS) data of the phase III PROSPER, SPARTAN, and ARAMIS trials have recently been reported. Therefore, we performed an updated meta-analysis and network meta-analysis to indirectly compare the efficacy and safety of currently available treatments.  Evidence acquisition:   Multiple databases were searched for articles published before January 2021.

Formal network meta-analyses were conducted. ARAT agent is associated with significantly longer OS compared to placebo (pooled hazard ratio [HR]: 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.65-0.83, P<0.001), with similar results shown for patients with both N1 and N0 disease (pooled HR 0.61 and pooled HR 0.76, respectively). In the network meta-analysis, apalutamide, darolutamide, and enzalutamide were more effective than placebo, with similar efficacies in terms of OS. For AEs (including any AEs, grade 3 or grade 4 AEs, grade 5 AEs, serious AEs, and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation), darolutamide was shown to be likely well tolerated. Quality of Life was preserved in treatment arms irrespective of the drug.

Materials and methods:   A prospective cohort of 1005 patients with clinical localized cancer prostate were operated from December 1999 to September 2013, in Lyon (France), and followed up to 172 months (median: 60 months). Patients encountered a RELP procedure, a totally extra-peritoneal approach with a retrograde dissection from the apex to the bladder neck, and ascending dissection of the erectile neurovascular bundles, facilitated by the 30° optic telescope. Adjunctive treatments were: immediate radiotherapy (9.2%), salvage radiotherapy (13.4%), androgen deprivation therapy (10.8%), chemotherapy (1.4%), no treatment (75.8%). Results The mean age was 63.4, the Gleason score was 4+3 or worse in 24.9%, there were 2.3% unifocal tumors. The pathology stages were pT2A (8.71%), pT2B (2.80%), pT2C (69.0%), pT3A (13.1%), and pT3B (6.41%).

Drug repurposing as a cost-effective and time-saving alternative to traditional drug development has been increasingly discussed. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as pantroprazole, which are commonly used as antacids, have also been shown to be effective in cancer chemoprevention via induction of apoptosis in multiple cancer cell lines. Vitamin C is an essential micronutrient for human body, has been proposed as a potential anti-cancer agent. In this context, have we investigated the combination of vitamin C and pantoprazole for the management of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Six chosen human adenocarcinoma cell lines were used to investigate the influence of pantoprazole on the microenvironment of cancer cells (extracellular pH and production of exosomes). Tumor growth and tumor 18F-FDG uptake in PC3 xenografts were analyzed following varied treatment. Our in vitro Results have suggested that pantoprazole enhanced the cytotoxic activity of vitamin C by regulating pH values and production of exosomes in cancer cells. Moreover, the synergistic effect of pantoprazole and vitamin C was pH-dependent since pantoprazole was more effective at a slightly acidic pH. In vivo, the combined treatment using pantoprazole and vitamin C produced better therapeutic outcomes than treatment with vitamin C or pantoprazole alone, as demonstrated via tumor growth and uptake of 18F-FDG. Therefore, we suggest that pantoprazole combined with vitamin C could be as a possible strategy to manage mCRPC.""","""['Zhoulei Li', 'Peng He', 'Yali Long', 'Gang Yuan', 'Wanqing Shen', 'Zhifeng Chen', 'Bing Zhang', 'Yue Wang', 'Dianchao Yue', 'Christof Seidl', 'Xiangsong Zhang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""['Pantoprazole Affecting Docetaxel Resistance Pathways via Autophagy (PANDORA): Phase II Trial of High Dose Pantoprazole (Autophagy Inhibitor) with Docetaxel in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC).', 'Increased Tumoral Microenvironmental pH Improves Cytotoxic Effect of Pharmacologic Ascorbic Acid in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Role of Baseline and Post-Therapy 18F-FDG PET in the Prognostic Stratification of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) Patients Treated with Radium-223.', 'Efficacy Against Human Prostate Cancer by Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-specific, Transforming Growth Factor-β Insensitive Genetically Targeted CD8+ T-cells Derived from Patients with Metastatic Castrate-resistant Disease.', 'Update on Systemic Prostate Cancer Therapies: Management of Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer in the Era of Precision Oncology.', 'Repurposing of rabeprazole as an anti-Trypanosoma cruzi drug that targets cellular triosephosphate isomerase.', 'Evaluation of the antioxidant potency of Greek honey from the Taygetos and Pindos mountains using a combination of cellular and molecular methods.', 'Proposal to Consider Chemical/Physical Microenvironment as a New Therapeutic Off-Target Approach.', 'In Vivo MRI-CEST Tumor pH Imaging Detects Resistance to Proton Pump Inhibitors in Human Prostate Cancer Murine Models.', 'The complex relationship between multiple drug resistance and the tumor pH gradient: a review.']"""

According to the European Association of Urology classification system, the patient harbors an intermediate-risk cancer. In step-by step discussion, we elaborate guideline-based treatment modalities for intermediate-risk PCa focused on debating active surveillance versus active treatment. Thereby, we discuss the importance of patient characteristics, including age, hereditary factors, life expectancy and comorbidity status, findings of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, as well as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density and PSA kinetics, in predicting the clinical course of the disease. In addition, we focus on cribriform pathology as a predictor of adverse outcomes and critically discuss its relevance in patient management. Lastly, we outline genomic stratification in ISUP 2 cancer as a future tool to predict PCa aggressiveness. PATIENT SUMMARY: Based on current guidelines, patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer are treated actively or can alternatively undergo an active surveillance approach when favorable risk factors are present. One major issue is to discriminate between patients who benefit from an active therapy approach and those who benefit from a deferred treatment.

We sought to evaluate the impact of participation in a multidisciplinary clinic, STAND (Supportive Therapy in Androgen Deprivation) Clinic, designed to provide individualized lifestyle modification and management of ADT-related side effects.  Methods:   This phase II study recruited men with prostate cancer who had started ADT <6 months prior to enrollment, and in whom ADT was planned for at least 12 months following enrollment. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the STAND Clinic or usual care. Patients randomized to the STAND Clinic were provided monthly multidisciplinary assessment and counseling on exercise, nutrition, and symptom management for 12 months on a rotating schedule. Primary outcome was change from baseline to 12 months in percent body fat. Feasibility outcomes were also assessed by measuring percentage of completed visits. Secondary outcomes included change from baseline to 12 months in 3 domains: (1) metabolic impact and bone health, (2) quality of life (QOL), and (3) physical activity.  Results:   A total of 25 men were randomized to STAND clinic, and 23 were randomized to usual care. The study did not meet its accrual target of 32 men in each arm and was closed early due to lack of financial support. Overall, 91% (295 of 325) of STAND clinic visits were completed. Eighteen out of the 25 patients in STAND clinic arm (72%) completed all 12 months of STAND clinic visits, and 80% (20 of 25) completed the first 6 months. For all primary and secondary outcomes, there were no statistically significant differences between treatment arms.

Methods:   Google Trends (trends.google.com) was utilized to assess public interest in multiple cancer types. We then constructed a forecasting model to determine the expected search interest had the pandemic not occurred. We then compared our models to actual screening usage during the pandemic.  Results:   Public interest in cancer screenings decreased precipitously at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that the Google Trends estimated the decrease in mammogram usage 25.8% below the actual value. Similarly, Google Trends estimated the decrease in colon cancer screening usage 9.7% below the true value.  Discussion:   We found the decrease in public interest in breast and colon cancer screenings slightly underestimated the actual screening usage numbers, suggesting Google Trends may be utilized as an indicator for human behavior regarding cancer screening, particularly with colon and breast cancer screenings. If the negative trend in cancer screening continues and missed screenings are not appropriately corrected for, socioeconomic and racial disparities in cancer diagnoses, morbidity, and mortality will widen.""","""['Benjamin Greiner', 'Shelby Tipton', 'Blessie Nelson', 'Micah Hartwell']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Curr Probl Cancer""","""['Online public interest in common malignancies and cancer screening during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.', 'Internet search volume for chest pain during the COVID-19 pandemic.', 'Information-Seeking Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic Across the United States: Longitudinal Analysis of Google Trends Data.', 'Impact of COVID-19 on cancer screening: a global perspective.', 'Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Colorectal Cancer Screening: a Systematic Review.', 'Cancer Patients with Chronic Pain and Their Caregivers during COVID-19: A Descriptive Study.', 'Impact of cancer awareness campaigns in Peru: a 5-year Google Trends analysis.', 'Impact of COVID-19 on Uro-Oncological Patients: A Comprehensive Review of the Literature.', 'Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on screening and diagnosis of patients with prostate cancer: a systematic review protocol.', 'A Novel Approach to Modeling and Forecasting Cancer Incidence and Mortality Rates through Web Queries and Automated Forecasting Algorithms: Evidence from Romania.']"""

Various models have been developed to predict BCR.  Objective:   In our study, we evaluated the accuracy of four pre-operative models (GP score, PRIX, D'Amico risk classification, CAPRA) in predicting BCR after RP in Turkish patients.  Methods:   Age, preoperative total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values, clinical stages, total number of cores taken in biopsy, number of positive cores, preoperative biopsy Gleason score (GS), follow-up time and presence of BCR after RP were recorded. BCR was defined as a total PSA value >0.2 ng/dL twice consecutively after RP. Classifications or scoring was performed according to pre-operative models. The 1-, 3- and 5-year BCR-free rates of the patients were determined for each model. Also, the accuracy of four predictive models for predicting 1-, 3- and 5-year BCR was evaluated.  Results:   For all pre-operative models there was a statistically significant difference between risk groups in BCR-free rates at 1-, 3- and 5-year after RP (P < .001). The Harrell's concordance index for 1-year BCR predictions was 0.802, 0.831, 0.773 and 0.745 for the GP score, PRIX, CAPRA and D'Amico, respectively. For 3-year BCR predictions, it was 0.798, 0.791, 0.723 and 0.714 for the GP score, PRIX, CAPRA and D'Amico and respectively. Finally, The Harrell's concordance index for 5-year BCR predictions was 0.778, 0.771, 0.702 and 0.693 for the GP score, PRIX, CAPRA and D'Amico, respectively.  Conclusion:   In the prediction of BCR, the accuracy of GP scoring and PRIX seems slightly higher than CAPRA and D'Amico risk classification.

The heterogeneity of protein and mRNA abundance and identification highlighted the heterogeneity of EV cargo, even between cell lines of a similar pathological group (e.g., ccRCC or pRCC). Overall, 1726 proteins were quantified across all EV samples, including 181 proteins that were detected in all samples. In the targeted profiling of mRNA by NanoString, 461 mRNAs were detected in EVs from at least one cell line, including 159 that were present in EVs from all cell lines.

Objective:   We investigated PSMA expression in neck persistent/recurrent disease (PRD) using immunohistochemistry and the association with radioiodine (RAI) or 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) uptake, and patient outcome.  Design, setting, and patients:   Data from 44 consecutive DTC patients who underwent neck reoperation from 2006 to 2018 in a comprehensive cancer center.  Main outcome measure(s):   Immunostaining was performed with vascular endothelial marker CD31 and PSMA. PSMA expression was quantified using the immunoreactive score (IRS). RAI and 18FDG uptake were assessed before surgery using posttherapeutic RAI scintigraphy and 18FDG positron emission tomography with computed tomography. Mean follow-up after reintervention was 6.5 ± 3.7 years.  Results:   Thirty patients (68%) showed at least 1 PSMA-positive lesion (IRS ≥ 2) with similar proportions in RAI-positive and RAI-negative patients (75% vs 66%). In RAI-negative patients, however, the proportion of PSMA-positive disease (79% vs 25%, P < 0.01) and the mean IRS (4.0 vs 1.0, P = 0.01) were higher in 18FDG-positive than in 18FDG-negative patients. Furthermore, mean IRS was higher in patients ≥ 55 years, large primary tumors (>40 mm) or aggressive subtypes, and was correlated with structural disease at last follow-up. Strong PSMA expression (IRS ≥ 9) was associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS).  Conclusions:   Our findings show that PSMA expression was present in two-thirds of patients with neck PRD, that it was related to poor prognostic factors and that very high expression was associated with poorer PFS.

Here, we investigated the effect of the overexpression of Nup88 on the migration and invasion of cervical cancer HeLa cells. The overexpression of Nup88 promoted a slight but significant increase in both migration and invasion, whereas knockdown of Nup88 by RNA interference suppressed these phenotypes. The observed phenotypes in Nup88-overexpressing HeLa cells were not due to the progression of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition or activation of NF-κB, which are known to be important for cell migration and invasion. Instead, we identified an upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-12 (MMP-12) at both the gene and protein levels in Nup88-overexpressing HeLa cells. Upregulation of MMP-12 protein by the overexpression of Nup88 was also observed in one other cervical cancer cell line and two prostate cancer cell lines but not 293 cells. Treatment with a selective inhibitor against MMP-12 enzymatic activity significantly suppressed the invasive ability of HeLa cells induced by Nup88 overexpression.

Methods: The effective dose was estimated and subsequently measured with electronic personal dosimeters for the following procedures and personnel: labeling and quality control by the radiopharmacy technologist, syringe preparation by the nuclear medicine laboratory technologist, patient administration by the nuclear medicine physician, patient imaging by the nuclear medicine imaging technologist, and robot-assisted laparoscopic salvage lymph node dissection attended by an anesthesiology technologist, scrub nurse, surgical nurse, and surgeon. The dose rate of the patient was measured immediately after administration of [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-I&S, after imaging, and after surgery. Results: The estimated dose per procedure ranged from 1.59 × 10-10 μSv (imaging technologist) to 9.74 μSv (scrub nurse). The measured effective dose ranged from 0 to 5 μSv for all personnel during a single procedure with [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-I&S. The highest effective dose was received by the scrub nurse (3.2 ± 1.3 μSv), whereas the lowest dose was measured for the surgical nurse (0.2 ± 0.5 μSv). If a single scrub nurse were to perform as many as 100 procedures with [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-I&S in a year, the total effective dose would be 320 μSv/y. Immediately after administration, the dose rate at 50 cm from the patient was 18.5 ± 1.6 μSv/h, which dropped to 1.8 ± 0.3 μSv/h after imaging the following day, reducing even further to 0.56 ± 0.33 μSv/h after surgery.

We tested this concept in non-metastatic UTUC patients treated with radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) and hypothesized that important differences may exist according to racial/ethnic groups. Material and Methods We relied on the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database (2004-2016). We relied on Propensity-score matching (ratio 1:4). Subsequently, cumulative incidence plots and multivariable competing risks regression models (CRR) addressed cancer-specific mortality (CSM). Results Of 9129 assessable patients, 7454 (81.7%) were Caucasian vs. 665 (7.3%) Hispanic vs. 584 (6.4%) Asian vs. 426 (4.7%) African-American. No statistically significant differences were recorded for tumor grade or T-stage, between all racial/ethnic groups. However, within patents who received lymph-node dissection (n = 2694, 29.5%), Asians exhibited the highest rate of more than 2 positive lymph nodes at RNU (19.0%, followed by 17.1% African-Americans, 15.0% Caucasians and 12.6% Hispanics, P < 0.001). After PS-matching and multivariable CRR, Asian race/ethnicity independently predicted higher CSM, relative to Caucasians (Hazard ratio: 1.29, P < 0.01). No statistically significant differences according to CSM was recorded in the remaining races/ethnicities comparisons (all P ≥ 0.1) Conclusion Important CSM differences may exist according to race/ethnicity in non-metastatic UTUC patients treated with RNU. However, these differences only apply to Asian patients, who account for 6% of the overall non-metastatic UTUC cohort treated with RNU. In consequence, in clinical practice Asian patients should be given particular attention with the intent of reducing the CSM disadvantage that cannot be clearly explained by stage and/or grade disadvantage at diagnosis.""","""['Claudia Collà Ruvolo', 'Mike Wenzel', 'Luigi Nocera', 'Christoph Würnschimmel', 'Zhe Tian', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Fred Saad', 'Nicola Longo', 'Ciro Imbimbo', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Vincenzo Mirone', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Survival advantage of Asian metastatic prostate cancer patients treated with external beam radiotherapy over other races/ethnicities.', 'The effect of race/ethnicity on histological subtype distribution, stage at presentation and cancer specific survival in urethral cancer.', 'Upper Urinary Tract Tumors: Variant Histology Versus Urothelial Carcinoma.', 'A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Clinicopathologic Factors Linked to Intravesical Recurrence After Radical Nephroureterectomy to Treat Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma.', 'Lymphadenectomy at the time of nephroureterectomy for upper tract urothelial cancer.', 'The Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index (SII) Increases the Prognostic Significance of Lymphovascular Invasion in Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma After Radical Nephroureterectomy.']"""

However, a body evidence supports the hypothesis that increased circulating folate levels due to excessive dietary or supplemental folic acid may be harmful for men with prostate cancer. Therefore, this pilot study aimed to investigate the feasibility of a reduced folic acid dietary intervention in men on an active surveillance monitoring program for prostate cancer.  Methods:   Men with low-grade prostate cancer enrolled into a 12-week dietary folic acid reduction diet. Primary outcome was red blood cell (RBC) folate reduction at 12 weeks. Other outcomes include serum folate, homocysteine, and vitamin B12 levels. The number of patients who complete the trial and reasons for disenrollment or dropout were also assessed.  Results:   Twenty-eight participants were enrolled into the dietary intervention study. Six participants withdrew from the study and a total of 21 participants completed all baseline and week 12 biochemical assessments. Only 18 participants completed all dietary questionnaires. Participants withdrew from the study due to difficulty with the diet or personal reasons. A substantial reduction was noted in serum folate (p < 0.007), RBC folate (p < 0.001) and dietary consumption of folic acid from foods (p = 0.003) and supplements (p = 0.003) without reduction in serum homocysteine or vitamin B12. Although an overall decrease in PSA from baseline to twelve weeks was found, the reduction was not significant (-3.55 ng/mL, p = 0.197).  Conclusions:   This phase 1 feasibility study reduced dietary folic acid intake from food and supplements and successfully lowered serum and RBC folate without resulting harmful effects. Data from this study supports future intervention trials with a larger prostate cancer active surveillance population and has the potential to reduce prostate cancer progression.

Material and methods:   A head and body phantom with seventeen tissue-equivalent materials were scanned consecutively at the participating centres using their individual clinical CT scan protocol and translated into SPR with their in-house CT-number-to-SPR conversion. Inter-centre variation and absolute accuracy in SPR prediction were quantified for three tissue groups: lung, soft tissues and bones. The integral effect on range prediction for typical clinical beams traversing different tissues was determined for representative beam paths for the treatment of primary brain tumours as well as lung and prostate cancer.  Results:   An inter-centre variation in SPR prediction (2σ) of 8.7%, 6.3% and 1.5% relative to water was determined for bone, lung and soft-tissue surrogates in the head setup, respectively. Slightly smaller variations were observed in the body phantom (6.2%, 3.1%, 1.3%). This translated into inter-centre variation of integral range prediction (2σ) of 2.9%, 2.6% and 1.3% for typical beam paths of prostate-, lung- and primary brain-tumour treatments, respectively. The absolute error in range exceeded 2% in every fourth participating centre. The consideration of beam hardening and the execution of an independent HLUT validation had a positive effect, on average.  Conclusion:   The large inter-centre variations in SPR and range prediction justify the currently clinically used margins accounting for range uncertainty, which are of the same magnitude as the inter-centre variation.

This energy can be implemented in different fields such as heat transfer enhancement, wastewater treatment and chemical reactions. In this study, a cystoscope based on small scale hydrodynamic cavitation was designed and fabricated to exploit the destructive energy of cavitation bubbles for treatment of tumor tissues. The developed device is equipped with a control system, which regulates the movement of the cystoscope in different directions. According to our experiments, the fabricated cystoscope was able to locate the target and expose cavitating flow to the target continuously and accurately. The designed cavitation probe embedded into the cystoscope caused a significant damage to prostate cancer and bladder cancer tissues within less than 15 minutes. The results of our experiments showed that the cavitation probe could be easily coupled with endoscopic devices because of its small diameter. We successfully integrated a biomedical camera, a suction tube, tendon cables, and the cavitation probe into a 6.7 mm diameter cystoscope, which could be controlled smoothly and accurately via a control system.

Results:   Thirty-one percent of patients completed the social determinants survey and enrolled in the study and 66% activated a patient portal. The likelihood of enrolling in the study was reduced with greater levels of social deprivation (odds ratio [OR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.98; P = .04).

The 3- and 5-year age-standardized relative survival for 491 patients with survival time information was 58.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 48.5%-67.7%) and 56.9% (95% CI, 39.8%-70.9%), respectively. In a multivariable analysis, survival was considerably poorer among patients without CDT versus those with therapy.  Conclusions:   This study shows that a large proportion of patients with PCa in SSA are not staged or are insufficiently staged and undertreated, and this results in unfavorable survival. These findings reemphasize the need for improving diagnostic workup and access to care in SSA in order to mitigate the heavy burden of the disease in the region.""","""['Tobias Paul Seraphin', 'Walburga Yvonne Joko-Fru', 'Lucia Hämmerl', 'Mirko Griesel', 'Nikolaus Christian Simon Mezger', 'Jana Cathrin Feuchtner', 'Innocent Adoubi', 'Marcel Dieu-Donné Egué', 'Nathan Okerosi', 'Henry Wabinga', 'Rolf Hansen', 'Samukeliso Vuma', 'Cesaltina Lorenzoni', 'Bourama Coulibaly', 'Sévérin W Odzebe', 'Nathan Gyabi Buziba', 'Abreha Aynalem', 'Biying Liu', 'Daniel Medenwald', 'Rafael T Mikolajczyk', 'Jason Alexander Efstathiou', 'Donald Maxwell Parkin', 'Ahmedin Jemal', 'Eva Johanna Kantelhardt']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['The state of our understanding of prostate cancer in sub-Saharan Africa.', 'Prostate cancer survival in sub-Saharan Africa by age, stage at diagnosis, and human development index: a population-based registry study.', 'Breast Cancer Diagnostics, Therapy, and Outcomes in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Population-Based Registry Study.', 'Cervical Cancer in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Multinational Population-Based Cohort Study of Care and Guideline Adherence.', 'Age at diagnosis and prostate cancer treatment and prognosis: a population-based cohort study.', 'Early versus deferred androgen suppression in the treatment of advanced prostatic cancer.', 'Potential New Approaches for Prostate Cancer Management in Resource-Limited Countries in Africa.', 'The use of 3D digital anatomy model improves the communication with patients presenting with prostate disease: The first experience in Senegal.', 'Strengthening Capacity for Prostate Cancer Early Diagnosis in West Africa Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Realist Approach to Rethinking and Operationalizing the World Health Organization 2017 Guide to Cancer Early Diagnosis.', 'Current and projected number of years of life lost due to prostate cancer: A global study.', 'Prostate cancer and the added burden of COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa: Rethinking regional priorities for responsive and data-driven cancer control programs.']"""

However, to the best of our knowledge, the role of SNHG11 in prostate cancer (PCa) development and metastasis remains unclear. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate the functional role and molecular mechanisms of SNHG11 in PCa progression. It was revealed that the SNHG11 expression levels were significantly upregulated in PCa tissues, in comparison with those in adjacent normal tissues. Functionally, SNHG11 knockdown significantly suppressed PCa cell proliferation, migration, invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, SNHG11 was found to positively regulate insulin‑like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF‑1R) expression by sponging microRNA (miRNA/miR)‑184 in PCa cells. The results of rescue experiments demonstrated that IGF‑1R overexpression reversed the suppressive effects of SNHG11 knockdown on the proliferation, migration and invasion of PCa cells. On the whole, the findings of the present study suggest that SNHG11 expression is upregulated in PCa and that it facilitates PCa progression, at least in part, via the modulation of the miR‑184/IGF‑1R signaling axis.""","""['Qiang Xie#', 'Shankun Zhao#', 'Ran Kang', 'Xiaolan Wang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Mol Med""","""['m6 A modification of lncRNA PCAT6 promotes bone metastasis in prostate cancer through IGF2BP2-mediated IGF1R mRNA stabilization.', 'Long Non-coding RNA AFAP1-AS1 Facilitates Prostate Cancer Progression by Regulating miR-15b/IGF1R Axis.', 'Long non-‑coding RNA SNHG16 functions as a tumor activator by sponging miR‑373‑3p to regulate the TGF‑β‑R2/SMAD pathway in prostate cancer.', 'Long non‑coding RNA BANCR mediates esophageal squamous cell carcinoma progression by regulating the\xa0IGF1R/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway via miR‑338‑3p.', 'Long non-coding RNA SNHG11 promotes cell proliferation, invasion and migration in glioma by targeting miR-154-5p.', 'Importance of long non-coding RNAs in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNAs and Long Non-Coding RNAs in Adrenocortical Carcinoma.', 'Long Noncoding RNA ENSG00000254693 Promotes Diabetic Kidney Disease via Interacting with HuR.', 'Circular RNA circ_0001459 accelerates hepatocellular carcinoma progression via the miR-6165/IGF1R axis.']"""

Conventional cancer treatment relies on radiotherapy and chemotherapy, but both methods bring severe side effects to patients, as these therapies not only attack cancer cells but also damage normal cells. Anticancer peptides (ACPs) are a promising alternative as therapeutic agents that are efficient and selective against tumor cells. Here, we propose a deep learning method based on convolutional neural networks to predict biological activity (EC50, LC50, IC50, and LD50) against six tumor cells, including breast, colon, cervix, lung, skin, and prostate. We show that models derived with multitask learning achieve better performance than conventional single-task models. In repeated 5-fold cross validation using the CancerPPD data set, the best models with the applicability domain defined obtain an average mean squared error of 0.1758, Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.8086, and Kendall's correlation coefficient of 0.6156. As a step toward model interpretability, we infer the contribution of each residue in the sequence to the predicted activity by means of feature importance weights derived from the convolutional layers of the model. The present method, referred to as xDeep-AcPEP, will help to identify effective ACPs in rational peptide design for therapeutic purposes.

A score of 1 means all sequences are below the minimum standard of diagnostic quality, 3 implies that the scan is of sufficient diagnostic quality, and 5 means that all three sequences are of optimal diagnostic quality. We investigated the inter-reader reproducibility of the PI-QUAL score in patients enrolled in the NeuroSAFE PROOF trial.  Methods:   We analysed the scans of 103 patients on different MR systems and vendors from 12 different hospitals. Two dedicated radiologists highly experienced in prostate mpMRI independently assessed the PI-QUAL score for each scan. Interobserver agreement was assessed using Cohen's kappa with standard quadratic weighting (κw) and percent agreement.  Results:   The agreement for each single PI-QUAL score was strong (κw = 0.85 and percent agreement = 84%). A similar agreement (κw = 0.82 and percent agreement = 84%) was observed when the scans were clustered into three groups (PI-QUAL 1-2 vs PI-QUAL 3 vs PI-QUAL 4-5). The agreement in terms of diagnostic quality for each single sequence was highest for T2-weighted imaging (92/103 scans; 89%), followed by dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences (91/103; 88%) and diffusion-weighted imaging (80/103; 78%).  Conclusion:   We observed strong reproducibility in the assessment of PI-QUAL between two radiologists with high expertise in prostate mpMRI. At present, PI-QUAL offers clinicians the only available tool for evaluating and reporting the quality of prostate mpMRI in a systematic manner but further refinements of this scoring system are warranted.  Key points:   • Inter-reader agreement for each single Prostate Imaging Quality (PI-QUAL) score (i.e., PI-QUAL 1 to PI-QUAL 5) was strong, with weighted kappa = 0.85 (95% confidence intervals: 0.51 - 1) and percent agreement = 84%. • Interobserver agreement was strong when the scans were clustered into three groups according to the ability (or not) to rule in and to rule out clinically significant prostate cancer (i.e., PI-QUAL 1-2 vs PI-QUAL 3 vs PI-QUAL 4-5), with weighted kappa = 0.82 (95% confidence intervals: 0.68 - 0.96) and percent agreement = 84%. • T2-weighted acquisitions were the most compliant with the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) v. 2.0 technical recommendations and were the sequences of highest diagnostic quality for both readers in 95/103 (92%) scans, followed by dynamic contrast enhanced acquisition with 81/103 (79%) scans and lastly by diffusion-weighted imaging with 79/103 (77%) scans.""","""['Francesco Giganti', 'Eoin Dinneen', 'Veeru Kasivisvanathan', 'Aiman Haider', 'Alex Freeman', 'Alex Kirkham', 'Shonit Punwani', 'Mark Emberton', 'Greg Shaw', 'Caroline M Moore', 'Clare Allen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Inter-reader agreement of the Prostate Imaging Quality (PI-QUAL) score: A bicentric study.', 'Prostate Imaging Quality (PI-QUAL): A New Quality Control Scoring System for Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Prostate from the PRECISION trial.', 'Impact of PI-QUAL on PI-RADS and cancer yield in an MRI-TRUS fusion biopsy population.', 'Understanding PI-QUAL for prostate MRI quality: a practical primer for radiologists.', 'Imaging quality and prostate MR: it is time to improve.', 'Taking PI-QUAL beyond the prostate: Towards a standardized radiological image quality score (RI-QUAL).', 'Role of the Prostate Imaging Quality PI-QUAL Score for Prostate Magnetic Resonance Image Quality in Pathological Upstaging After Radical Prostatectomy: A Multicentre European Study.', 'Are Urologists Ready for Interpretation of Multiparametric MRI Findings?

The prognosis of PCa is heterogeneous with many clinically indolent tumors and rare highly aggressive cases. Reliable tissue markers of prognosis are lacking. Active cholesteryl ester synthesis has been associated with prostate cancer aggressiveness. Sterol-O-Acyl transferases (SOAT) 1 and 2 catalyze cholesterol esterification in humans.  Objective:   To investigate the value of SOAT1 and SOAT2 tissue expression as prognostic markers in high risk PCa.  Patients and methods:   Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 305 high risk PCa cases treated with radical prostatectomy were analyzed for SOAT1 and SOAT2 protein expression by semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards modeling were used to compare outcome.  Main outcome measure:   Biochemical recurrence (BCR) free survival.  Results:   SOAT1 expression was high in 73 (25%) and low in 219 (75%; not evaluable: 13) tumors. SOAT2 was highly expressed in 40 (14%) and at low levels in 249 (86%) samples (not evaluable: 16). By Kaplan-Meier analysis, we found significantly shorter median BCR free survival of 93 months (95% confidence interval 23.6-123.1) in patients with high SOAT1 vs. 134 months (112.6-220.2, Log-rank p < 0.001) with low SOAT1. SOAT2 expression was not significantly associated with BCR. After adjustment for age, preoperative PSA, tumor stage, Gleason score, resection status, lymph node involvement and year of surgery, high SOAT1 but not SOAT2 expression was associated with shorter BCR free survival with a hazard ratio of 2.40 (95% CI 1.57-3.68, p < 0.001). Time to clinical recurrence and overall survival were not significantly associated with SOAT1 and SOAT2 expression CONCLUSIONS: SOAT1 expression is strongly associated with BCR free survival alone and after multivariable adjustment in high risk PCa.

To identify such genetic dependencies, we performed genome-scale CRISPRi screens in metastatic prostate cancer models. We then created a pipeline in which we integrated pan-cancer functional genomics data with our metastatic prostate cancer functional and clinical genomics data to identify genes that can drive aggressive prostate cancer phenotypes. Our integrative analysis of these data reveals known prostate cancer specific driver genes, such as AR and HOXB13, as well as a number of top hits that are poorly characterized. In this study we highlight the strength of an integrated clinical and functional genomics pipeline and focus on two top hit genes, KIF4A and WDR62.

However, their efficacy is hindered due to de novo presentation with or the development of resistance. Characterizing models of taxane-resistant prostate cancer will lead to creation of strategies to overcome insensitivity. We have previously characterized docetaxel-resistant C4-2B and DU145 cell line derivatives, TaxR and DU145-DTXR, respectively. In the present study, we characterize cabazitaxel-resistant derivative cell lines created from chronic cabazitaxel exposure of TaxR and DU145-DTXR cells, CabR and CTXR, respectively. We show that CabR and CTXR cells are robustly resistant to both taxanes but retain sensitivity to antiandrogens. Both CabR and CTXR cells possess increased expression of ABCB1, which is shown to mediate resistance to treatment. Interestingly, we also present evidence for coordinated overexpression of additional genes present within the 7q21.12 gene locus where ABCB1 resides. This locus, known as the ABCB1 amplicon, has been demonstrated to be amplified in multidrug-resistant tumor cells, but little is known regarding its role in prostate cancer. We show that two ABCB1-amplicon genes other than ABCB1, RUNDC3B and DBF4, promote cellular viability and treatment resistance in taxane-resistant prostate cancer models. We present evidence that coordinated amplification of ABCB1-amplicon genes is common in a subset of prostate cancer patients.

Recent studies have investigated safety of ICT rechallenge after irAEs, and evidence suggests that rechallenge may be associated with improved antitumor responses. However, data are limited on response duration after ICT rechallenge, particularly after severe irAEs.  Objective:   To evaluate safety and efficacy of ICT rechallenge after moderate-to-severe irAEs in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC), urothelial carcinoma (UC), and prostate cancer.  Methods:   In this retrospective cohort study, medical records from September 25, 2013, to June 1, 2020, for patients with genitourinary (GU) cancers at MD Anderson Cancer Center who were rechallenged with the same or different ICT following irAEs were reviewed. Demographics, ICT exposure, irAEs (grade and treatment), ICT discontinuation or rechallenge, rates of subsequent irAEs (new or recurrent) and antitumor activity (objective response rates and response duration) were reviewed.  Results:   Sixty-one patients with RCC, UC, and prostate cancer were rechallenged with ICT after experiencing 105 total irAEs. Objective response rates after rechallenge, that is, upgrade in response, were 14% in RCC (4/28), 21% in UC (3/14), and 0% in prostate cancer. All seven patients who achieved upgrade in response had initial grade 2 or 3 irAEs. Responses were durable among these seven patients, with median radiographic progression-free survival not reached (range: 3.7-66.4 months) as of the March 8, 2021, data cut-off (median follow-up 40.9 months (95% CI 35.3 to 46.5)). All achieved complete response except one patient who was lost to follow-up. The rate of subsequent grade 3 or 4 irAEs after rechallenge was 30%, with no fatal irAEs. The rate of recrudescence of the same irAE was 26% (16/61). 54% of patients received corticosteroids (33/61), and 21% received targeted immunosuppression (13/61) for the initial irAEs.  Conclusions and relevance:   ICT rechallenge after moderate-to-severe irAEs was associated with deep and durable responses in a subset of patients with RCC and UC, with acceptable safety and no fatal events.

Because of its longer half-life, the 89Zr-labeled ligand 89Zr-PSMA-DFO allows acquisition of PET scans up to 6 d after injection, thereby overcoming the above limitation. We investigated whether 89Zr-PSMA-DFO allowed more sensitive detection of weak PSMA-positive prostate cancer lesions. Methods: We selected 14 prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence who exhibited no PSMA-positive lesions on a PET scan acquired with existing PSMA tracers (68Ga-PSMA-11, 18F-JK-PSMA-7). Within 5 wk after the negative scan result, we obtained a second PSMA PET scan using 89Zr-PSMA-DFO (117 ± 16 MBq, PET acquisition within 6 d of injection). Results:89Zr-PSMA-DFO detected 15 PSMA-positive lesions in 8 of 14 patients, who had a PET-negative reading of their initial PET scans with existing tracers. In these 8 patients, the new scans revealed localized recurrence of disease (3/8), metastases in lymph nodes (3/8), or lesions at distant sites (2/8). On the basis of these results, patients received lesion-targeted radiotherapies (5/8), androgen deprivation therapies (2/8), or no therapy (1/8). The plausibility of 14 of 15 lesions was supported by histology, clinical follow-up after radiotherapy, or subsequent imaging. Furthermore, comparison of the 15 89Zr-PSMA-DFO-positive lesions with their correlates on the original PET scan revealed that established tracers exhibited mild accumulation in 7 of 15 lesions; however, contrast-to-noise ratios were too low for robust detection of these lesions (contrast-to-noise ratios, 2.4 ± 3.7 for established tracers vs. 10.2 ± 8.5 for 89Zr-PSMA-DFO, P = 0.0014). The SUVmax of the 15 89Zr-PSMA-DFO-positive lesions (11.5 ± 5.8) was significantly higher than the SUVmax on the original PET scans (4.7 ± 2.8, P = 0.0001). Kidneys were the most exposed organ, with doses of 3.3 ± 0.7 mGy/MBq. The effective dose was 0.15 ± 0.04 mSv/MBq. Conclusion: In patients with weak PSMA expression, a longer period of time might be needed for ligand internalization than that offered by existing PSMA tracers to make lesions visible on PET/CT scans. Hence, 89Zr-PSMA-DFO might be of significant benefit to patients in whom the search for weak PSMA-positive lesions is challenging. Radiation exposure should be weighed against the potential benefit of metastasis-directed therapy or salvage radiotherapy, which we initiated in 36% (5/14) of our patients based on their 89Zr-PSMA-DFO PET scans.""","""['Felix Dietlein', 'Carsten Kobe', 'Sergio Muñoz Vázquez', 'Thomas Fischer', 'Heike Endepols', 'Melanie Hohberg', 'Manuel Reifegerst', 'Bernd Neumaier', 'Klaus Schomäcker', 'Alexander E Drzezga', 'Markus Dietlein']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Translational Development of a Zr-89-Labeled Inhibitor of Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen for PET Imaging in Prostate Cancer.', '89ZrZr-PSMA-617 PET/CT in biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer: first clinical experience from a pilot study including biodistribution and dose estimates.', 'Use and Impact of Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Prior to Salvage Radiation Therapy in Men with Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy: A Scoping Review.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'The Application of Radiolabeled Targeted Molecular Probes for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Detection efficacy of\xa089ZrZr-PSMA-617 PET/CT in\xa068GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT-negative biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.', 'Histologically Confirmed Testicular Metastasis Revealed by 89ZrZr-PSMA-617 PET/CT in a Patient with Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer and Negative Conventional PSMA PET/CT Imaging.', 'Detection Efficacy of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer with Very Low PSA Levels: A 7-Year, Two-Center ""Real-World"" Experience.', 'Optimization of the radiation dosimetry protocol in Lutetium-177-PSMA therapy: toward clinical implementation.']"""

However, treatment resistance occurs frequently, and combination therapies may improve outcomes. We report the final safety and efficacy results of a phase I/II study combining 177Lu-PSMA-617 with idronoxil (NOX66), a radiosensitizer, and examine potential clinical, blood-based, and imaging biomarkers. Methods: Fifty-six men with progressive mCRPC previously treated with taxane chemotherapy and novel androgen signaling inhibitor (ASI) were enrolled. Patients received up to 6 doses of 177Lu-PSMA-617 (7.5 GBq) on day 1 in combination with a NOX66 suppository on days 1-10 of each 6-wk cycle. Cohort 1 (n = 8) received 400 mg of NOX66, cohort 2 (n = 24) received 800 mg, and cohort 3 (n = 24) received 1,200 mg. 68Ga-PSMA and 18F-FDG PET/CT were performed at study entry, and semiquantitative imaging analysis was undertaken. Blood samples were collected for analysis of blood-based biomarkers, including androgen receptor splice variant 7 expression. The primary outcomes were safety and tolerability; secondary outcomes included efficacy, pain scores, and xerostomia. Regression analyses were performed to explore the prognostic value of baseline clinical, blood-based, and imaging parameters. Results: Fifty-six of the 100 men screened were enrolled (56%), with a screening failure rate of 26% (26/100) for PET imaging criteria. All men had received prior treatment with ASI and docetaxel, and 95% (53/56) had received cabazitaxel. Ninety-six percent (54/56) of patients received at least 2 cycles of combination NOX66 and 177Lu-PSMA-617, and 46% (26/56) completed 6 cycles. Common adverse events were anemia, fatigue, and xerostomia. Anal irritation attributable to NOX66 occurred in 38%. Forty-eight of 56 had a reduction in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (86%; 95% CI, 74%-94%); 34 of 56 (61%; 95% CI, 47%-74%) had a PSA reduction of at least 50%. Median PSA progression-free survival was 7.5 mo (95% CI, 5.9-9 mo), and median overall survival was 19.7 mo (95% CI, 9.5-30 mo). A higher PSMA SUVmean correlated with treatment response, whereas a higher PSMA tumor volume and prior treatment with ASI for less than 12 mo were associated with worse overall survival. Conclusion: NOX66 with 177Lu-PSMA-617 is a safe and feasible strategy in men being treated with third-line therapy and beyond for mCRPC.

Methods:68Ga-PSMA-11 hybrid PET was performed on 2,005 patients at the time of biochemically recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy (RP) (50.8%), definitive radiation therapy (RT) (19.7%), or RP with postoperative RT (PORT) (29.6%). The presence of prostate cancer was assessed qualitatively (detection rate = positivity rate) and quantitatively on a per-patient and per-region basis, creating a disease burden estimate from the presence or absence of local (prostate/prostate bed), nodal (N1: pelvis), and distant metastatic (M1: distant soft tissue and bone) disease. The primary study endpoint was the positive predictive value (PPV) of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT confirmed by histopathology. Results: After RP, the scan detection rate increased significantly with rising PSA level (44.8% at PSA < 0.25%-96.2% at PSA > 10 ng/mL; P < 0.001). The detection rate significantly increased with rising PSA level in each individual region, overall disease burden, prior androgen deprivation, clinical T-stage, and Gleason grading from the RP specimen (P < 0.001). After RT, the detection rate for in-gland prostate recurrence was 64.0%, compared with 20.6% prostate bed recurrence after RP and 13.3% after PORT. PSMA-positive pelvic nodal disease was detected in 42.7% after RP, 40.8% after PORT, and 38.8% after RT. In patients with histopathologic validation, the PPV per patient was 0.82 (146/179).

Patients and methods:   We analyzed 2,506 patients treated with RTx (external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy or combinations) between years 2000 and 2021. Kaplan Meier and multivariable Cox regression models tested BCR-free survival and OS after stratification according to TTN (≤24 vs. 24.1-60 vs. >60 months). Similar analyses were performed after stratification according to absolute PSA values at nadir (<0.01 vs. 0.01-0.1 vs. 0.11-0.4 vs. >0.4 ng/ml). Finally, we repeated analyses after setting the time point of PSA nadir as the beginning of follow up in survival analyses.

Longer TTN was an independent predictor for BCR-free survival and OS (all P<0.001). However, after accounting for lead-time bias, in multivariable analyses, this association remained only significant for BCR-free survival (P≤0.03), but not for OS (P≥0.1). Finally, compared to a PSA nadir of <0.01 ng/ml, PSA nadir of 0.01-0.1 ng/ml, 0.11-0.4 ng/ml as well as >0.4 ng/ml were independent predictors for shorter BCR-free survival (P≤0.02), but not OS (P≥0.08).

In current practice, mutational testing of prostate cancer patients is commonly done late i.e., when the tumor is castration resistant. In addition, most sequencing panels do not include TP53, one of the most crucial tumor suppressor genes in human cancer. In this proof-of-concept study, we sought to extend the clinical use of these molecular markers by exploring the early prognostic impact of mutations in TP53 and DNA damage repair genes in men with primary, nonmetastatic prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy (RPX).  Methods:   Tumor specimens from a cohort of 68 RPX patients with intermediate (n = 11, 16.2%) or high-risk (n = 57, 83.8%) disease were analyzed by targeted next generation sequencing using a 37 DNA damage repair and checkpoint gene panel including TP53. Sequencing results were correlated to clinicopathologic variables as well as PSA persistence or time to PSA failure. In addition, the distribution of TP53 and DNA damage repair gene mutations was analyzed in three large publicly available datasets (TCGA, MSKCC and SU2C).  Results:   Of 68 primary prostate cancers analyzed, 23 (33.8%) were found to harbor a mutation in either TP53 (n = 12, 17.6%) or a DNA damage repair gene (n = 11, 16.2%). The vast majority of these mutations (22 of 23, 95.7%) were detected in primary tumors from patients with high-risk features. These mutations were mutually exclusive in our cohort and additional data mining suggests an enrichment of DNA damage repair gene mutations in TP53 wild-type tumors. Mutations in either TP53 or a DNA damage repair gene were associated with a significantly worse prognosis after RPX. Importantly, the presence of TP53/DNA damage repair gene mutations was an independent risk factor for PSA failure or PSA persistence in multivariate Cox regression models.  Conclusion:   TP53 or DNA damage repair gene mutations are frequently detected in primary prostate cancer with high-risk features and define a subgroup of patients with an increased risk for PSA failure or persistence after RPX. The significant adverse impact of these alterations on patient prognosis may be exploited to identify men with prostate cancer who may benefit from a more intensified treatment.""","""['Cathleen Nientiedt', 'Jan Budczies', 'Volker Endris', 'Martina Kirchner', 'Constantin Schwab', 'Christina Jurcic', 'Rouven Behnisch', 'Shirin Hoveida', 'Philippa Lantwin', 'Adam Kaczorowski', 'Christine Geisler', 'Svenja Dieffenbacher', 'Fabian Falkenbach', 'Desiree Franke', 'Magdalena Görtz', 'Martina Heller', 'Ruth Himmelsbach', 'Carine Pecqueux', 'Mathias Rath', 'Philipp Reimold', 'Viktoria Schütz', 'Iva Simunovic', 'Elena Walter', 'Luisa Hofer', 'Claudia Gasch', 'Gita Schönberg', 'Lars Pursche', 'Gencay Hatiboglu', 'Joanne Nyarangi-Dix', 'Holger Sültmann', 'Stefanie Zschäbitz', 'Stefan A Koerber', 'Dirk Jäger', 'Jürgen Debus', 'Anette Duensing', 'Peter Schirmacher', 'Markus Hohenfellner', 'Albrecht Stenzinger', 'Stefan Duensing']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['High prevalence of DNA damage repair gene defects and TP53 alterations in men with treatment-naïve metastatic prostate cancer -Results from a prospective pilot study using a 37 gene panel.', 'Compound Genomic Alterations of TP53, PTEN, and RB1 Tumor Suppressors in Localized and Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Association of Tumor Protein p53 and Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated Comutation With Response to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors and Mortality in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Germline and Somatic Defects in DNA Repair Pathways in Prostate Cancer.', 'Involvement of the multiple tumor suppressor genes and 12-lipoxygenase in human prostate cancer.

This study aims to explore the potential causal relationship between circulating vitamin C and risk of five most common cancers in Europe.  Methods:   We used summary-level data for genetic variants associated with plasma vitamin C in a large vitamin C genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis on 52,018 Europeans, and the corresponding associations with lung, breast, prostate, colon, and rectal cancer from GWAS consortia including up to 870,984 participants of European ancestry. We performed two-sample, bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses using inverse-variance-weighted method as the primary approach, while using 6 additional methods (e.g., MR-Egger, weighted median-based, and mode-based methods) as sensitivity analysis to detect and adjust for pleiotropy. We also conducted a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies and randomized controlled trials to examine the association of vitamin C intakes with cancer outcomes.  Results:   The MR analysis showed no evidence of a causal association of circulating vitamin C concentration with any examined cancer. Although the odds ratio (OR) per one standard deviation increase in genetically predicted circulating vitamin C concentration was 1.34 (95% confidence interval 1.14 to 1.57) for breast cancer in the UK Biobank, this association could not be replicated in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium with an OR of 1.05 (0.94 to 1.17). Smoking initiation, as a positive control for our reverse MR analysis, showed a negative association with circulating vitamin C concentration. However, there was no strong evidence of a causal association of any examined cancer with circulating vitamin C. Sensitivity analysis using 6 different analytical approaches yielded similar results. Moreover, our MR results were consistent with the null findings from the meta-analysis exploring prospective associations of dietary or supplemental vitamin C intakes with cancer risk, except that higher dietary vitamin C intake, but not vitamin C supplement, was associated with a lower risk of lung cancer (risk ratio: 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 0.99).

Previous studies have demonstrated that 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin-D3 (vitamin D) exhibited anti-cancer activity against breast and prostate cancer.  Objectives:   The aim of the current study is to investigate the effect of vitamin D on NSCLC and its underlying mechanism.  Methods:   The effects of vitamin D on stemness maintenance and the Warburg effect in NSCLC cells were investigated both in vitro and in vivo.  Results and discussion:   In vitro experiments revealed that vitamin D inhibited glycolysis and stemness maintenance in A549 and NCI-H1975 cells. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments indicated that vitamin D attenuated the expression of metabolism-related enzymes associated with the Warburg effect (GLUT1, LDHA, HK2, and PKM2). In addition, vitamin D down-regulated the expression of stemness-related genes (Oct-4, SOX-2, and Nanog) and the expression of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR.  Conclusion:   Overall, these findings suggest that vitamin D suppresses the Warburg effect and stemness maintenance in NSCLC cells via the inactivation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, thereby inhibiting the progression of NSCLC.

Patients received 45 Gy in 25 fractions to the prostate and pelvic lymph nodes with a simultaneous intensity-modulated radiotherapy boost of 22.5 Gy to the prostate (total dose 67.5 Gy in 25 fractions), with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for 2-3 years. The primary endpoint was biochemical failure. Secondary endpoints included distant metastases and overall survival. Multivariable analysis was performed to look for predictive factors. Late toxicity was assessed using CTCAE v3.0.  Results:   230 patients enrolled. Median follow-up was 11.2 years (IQR 8.1-12.9). At 10 years, cumulative incidence of biochemical failure was 33.4%, distant metastasis was 16.5%, and overall survival was 76.3%.

Phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) loss is a predictor of adverse clinical outcomes. The association between PTEN expression and morphological patterns of prostate cancer is unclear.  Methods and results:   We explored the association between PTEN expression by immunohistochemistry, Gleason pattern 4 morphologies, IDCP and biochemical recurrence (BCR) in 163 radical prostatectomy specimens. IDCP was delineated from invasive cribriform carcinoma by p63 positive immunohistochemical staining in basal cells. Combined invasive cribriform carcinoma and IDCP were associated with a higher cumulative incidence of BCR [hazard ratio (HR) = 5.06; 2.21, 11.6, P < 0.001]. When including PTEN loss in the analysis, invasive cribriform carcinoma remained predictive of BCR (HR = 3.72; 1.75, 7.94, P = 0.001), while PTEN loss within invasive cribriform carcinoma did not. Glomeruloid morphology was associated with lower odds of cancer stage pT3 and lower cumulative incidence of BCR (HR = 0.27; 0.088, 0.796, P = 0.018), while PTEN loss within glomeruloid morphology was associated with a higher cumulative incidence of BCR (HR = 4.07; 1.04, 15.9, P = 0.043).  Conclusions:   PTEN loss within glomeruloid pattern was associated with BCR.

This mendelian randomisation (MR) study investigates evidence supporting causal relationships of body mass index (BMI), fat mass index (FMI), fat-free mass index (FFMI), and height with cancer risk.  Methods and findings:   Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used as instrumental variables for BMI (312 SNPs), FMI (577 SNPs), FFMI (577 SNPs), and height (293 SNPs). Associations of the genetic variants with 22 site-specific cancers and overall cancer were estimated in 367,561 individuals from the UK Biobank (UKBB) and with lung, breast, ovarian, uterine, and prostate cancer in large international consortia. In the UKBB, genetically predicted BMI was positively associated with overall cancer (odds ratio [OR] per 1 kg/m2 increase 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.02; p = 0.043); several digestive system cancers: stomach (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.06-1.21; p < 0.001), esophagus (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.03, 1.17; p = 0.003), liver (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.03-1.25; p = 0.012), and pancreas (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.12; p = 0.016); and lung cancer (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.04-1.12; p < 0.001). For sex-specific cancers, genetically predicted elevated BMI was associated with an increased risk of uterine cancer (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.05-1.15; p < 0.001) and with a lower risk of prostate cancer (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.94-0.99; p = 0.009). When dividing cancers into digestive system versus non-digestive system, genetically predicted BMI was positively associated with digestive system cancers (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.06; p < 0.001) but not with non-digestive system cancers (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.99-1.02; p = 0.369). Genetically predicted FMI was positively associated with liver, pancreatic, and lung cancer and inversely associated with melanoma and prostate cancer. Genetically predicted FFMI was positively associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and melanoma. Genetically predicted height was associated with increased risk of overall cancer (OR per 1 standard deviation increase 1.09; 95% CI 1.05-1.12; p < 0.001) and multiple site-specific cancers. Similar results were observed in analyses using the weighted median and MR-Egger methods. Results based on consortium data confirmed the positive associations between BMI and lung and uterine cancer risk as well as the inverse association between BMI and prostate cancer, and, additionally, showed an inverse association between genetically predicted BMI and breast cancer. The main limitations are the assumption that genetic associations with cancer outcomes are mediated via the proposed risk factors and that estimates for some lower frequency cancer types are subject to low precision.  Conclusions:   Our results show that the evidence for BMI as a causal risk factor for cancer is mixed. We find that BMI has a consistent causal role in increasing risk of digestive system cancers and a role for sex-specific cancers with inconsistent directions of effect. In contrast, increased height appears to have a consistent risk-increasing effect on overall and site-specific cancers.""","""['Mathew Vithayathil', 'Paul Carter', 'Siddhartha Kar', 'Amy M Mason', 'Stephen Burgess', 'Susanna C Larsson']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""PLoS Med""","""['Smoking, alcohol consumption, and cancer: A mendelian randomisation study in UK Biobank and international genetic consortia participants.', 'Assessing the causal role of epigenetic clocks in the development of multiple cancers: a Mendelian randomization study.', 'A data-driven approach for studying the role of body mass in multiple diseases: a phenome-wide registry-based case-control study in the UK Biobank.', 'Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D and Cancer Risk: A Systematic Review of Mendelian Randomization Studies.', 'Type 2 Diabetes and Cancer: An Umbrella Review of Observational and Mendelian Randomization Studies.', 'A comparison of the microbiome composition in lower respiratory tract at different sites in early lung cancer patients.', 'Associations between an obesity-related dietary pattern and incidence of overall and site-specific cancers: a prospective cohort study.', 'Impact of body mass index in patients receiving atezolizumab plus bevacizumab for hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Synchronous multiple primary malignant neoplasms in breast, kidney, and bilateral thyroid: A case report.', 'The Global, Regional, and National Uterine Cancer Burden Attributable to High BMI from 1990 to 2019: A Systematic Analysis of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.']"""

Methods:   Retrospective analysis of patients who underwent FLA for low-intermediate risk PCa between 2010 and 2014 was performed. Early (median 4 months) and late mpMRI (median 49 months) follow-up were qualitatively assessed for T2-weighted, dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) appearances and also compared to corresponding PSA values and biopsy results.  Results:   55 cancers were treated in 54 men (mean age 61.0 years). Early mpMRI was performed in 30 (54.5%) patients while late follow-up mpMRI in 42 (84%). Ill-defined scarring with and without atrophy at the treatment site were the most common appearances. In patients with paired MRI and biopsy, one of four patients with clinically significant PCa on biopsy (≥GG2 or≥6 mm GG1) showed hyperenhancement or restricted diffusion at early follow-up. At late follow-up, positive biopsies were seen in 5/8 (63%) cases with hyperenhancement and 5/6 (83%) cases with restricted diffusion at the treatment site. PSA change was not associated with biopsy results at either time point.  Conclusion:   mpMRI is able to document the morphological and temporal changes following focal therapy. It has limited ability to detect recurrent disease in early months following treatment. Late-term mpMRI is sensitive at identifying patients with recurrent disease.

Whether metformin, a diabetes agent that inhibits the mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation chain, could improve radiotherapy and chemotherapy response in LA-NSCLC remains to be studied.  Objective:   To examine whether metformin, given concurrently with chemoradiotherapy and as consolidation treatment, could improve outcomes in patients with LA-NSCLC.  Design, setting, and participants:   The Ontario Clinical Oncology Group Advanced Lung Cancer Treatment With Metformin and Chemoradiotherapy (OCOG-ALMERA) study was a multicenter phase 2 randomized clinical trial. Patients were stratified for stage IIIA vs IIIB LA-NSCLC and use of consolidation chemotherapy. The trial was designed to enroll 96 patients with unresected LA-NSCLC who did not have diabetes. The trial was conducted from September 24, 2014, to March 8, 2019.  Interventions:   Patients were randomized to platinum-based chemotherapy, concurrent with chest radiotherapy (60-63 Gy), with or without consolidation chemotherapy or the same treatment plus metformin, 2000 mg/d, during chemoradiotherapy and afterward for up to 12 months.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who experienced a failure event (ie, locoregional disease progression, distant metastases, death, and discontinuation of trial treatment or planned evaluations for any reason within 12 months). Proportions were compared using a 2-sided Fisher exact test. Conventional progression-free and overall survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Adverse events were graded with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03. All randomized patients were included in an intention-to-treat analysis.  Results:   The trial was stopped early due to slow accrual. Between 2014 and 2019, 54 patients were randomized (26 in experimental arm and 28 in control arm). Participants included 30 women (55.6%); mean (SD) age was 65.6 (7.6) years. Treatment failure was detected in 18 patients (69.2%) receiving metformin within 1 year vs 12 (42.9%) control patients (P = .05). The 1-year progression-free survival rate was 34.8% (95% CI, 16.6%-53.7%) in the metformin arm and 63.0% (95% CI, 42.1%-78.1%) in the control arm (hazard ratio, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.14-5.10) The overall survival rates were 47.4% (95% CI, 26.3%-65.9%) in the metformin arm and 85.2% (95% CI, 65.2%-94.2%) in the control arm (hazard ratio, 3.80; 95% CI, 1.49-9.73). More patients in the experimental arm vs control arm (53.8% vs 25.0%) reported at least 1 grade 3 or higher adverse event.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this randomized clinical trial, the addition of metformin to chemoradiotherapy was associated with worse treatment efficacy and increased toxic effects compared with combined modality therapy alone.

We analysed a cohort of patients with prostate cancer lymph node oligometastases detected on PSMA-PET/CT.  Materials and methods:   Ninety patients with metachronous oligometastatic prostate cancer received SBRT for 1-3 lymph node metastases diagnosed on 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT. The primary end point was progression free survival (PFS), with disease progression defined as occurrence of either target lesion progression, new metastatic lesion or biochemical progression.

Baseline patient characteristics were tested for association with PFS and a preliminary risk score was created.  Results:   Median follow-up was 21 months (interquartile range 10-31 months). Median PFS and BPFS were 16 and 21 months, respectively. Median ADT-FS was not reached (73% (95%-CI 62-86%) at 24 months).

The androgen receptor (AR) plays key roles in PCa and CRPC progression and drug resistance. Histone acetyltransferase 1 (HAT1) has recently been reported to be highly expressed in some tumors, such as lung carcinoma. However, what relationship between the AR and HAT1, and whether or how HAT1 plays roles in CRPC progression and drug resistance remain elusive. In the present study, we found that HAT1 is highly expressed in PCa cells, and the overexpression of HAT1 is linked with CRPC cell proliferation. Moreover, the HAT1 expression is positively correlated with the expression of AR, including both AR-FL (full-length) and AR-V7 (variant 7), which is mainly mediated by a bromodomain containing protein 4 (BRD4) -mediated pathway. Furthermore, knockdown of HAT1 can re-sensitize the response of CRPC cells to ENZ treatment in cells and mouse models. In addition, ascorbate was observed to decrease AR expression through downregulation of HAT1 expression.

Methods:   We obtained records from a health promotion center database of male patients who visited between March 2019 and February 2020. Men without a history of treatment for lower urinary tract symptoms were evaluated using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Overactive Bladder Symptom Score, transrectal ultrasonography, medical history, and carotid duplex ultrasound for the evaluation of atherosclerosis.

In the OAB group without BPH/LUTS, carotid atherosclerosis was significantly associated with the severity of OAB symptoms. A history of diabetes mellitus was the only variable that was associated with the severity of urinary urgency. Systolic blood pressure was associated with severity of urinary urgency in the OAB group with BPH/LUTS.

We have evaluated the influence of the pelvic dynamic phase on the final reading of whole-body 18 F-FCH PET, to assess the need for a two-stage protocol. Reading the physician's experience and patient's previous treatment profile was also considered as potential influencing factors on final PET interpretation.  Methods:   All 18 F-FCH PET/CT performed from January 2018 to September 2019 in patients with prostate cancer and including a pelvic dynamic phase followed by a delayed whole-body acquisition were retrospectively retrieved. PET/CT were analysed by one expert nuclear medicine physician and one resident. The whole-body scan was analysed blinded (first reading) and nonblinded from the results of the dynamic phase.  Results:   221 consecutive PET/CT were selected from 201 patients previously treated by radical prostatectomy (n = 31), pelvic radiation therapy (n = 60), or both (n = 94). 24 patients had no previous treatments, and 12 benefited from other focal treatments. In the whole population, dynamic acquisition modified final interpretation of 32/221 scans (14.5%) for residents, 26 (11.8%) for experts and 19 (8.6%) for consensual reading. No influence of previous treatments was found. The availability of a dynamic phase would have been responsible for treatment modification in 5/221 scans (2.3%). Considering only the prostate bed, dynamic acquisition modified the final interpretation in 7/125 (5.6%) studies (consensual reading) from patients with previous prostatic surgery and 4/84 (4.8%) scans from patients without a history of prostatic surgical intervention. No significant influence of dynamic acquisition was found on the final PET interpretation on prostate lodge accordingly to previous prostatic surgery.

Docetaxel-based therapy remains the first-line treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. However, dose-limiting toxicity including neutropenia, myelosuppression and neurotoxicity is the major reason for docetaxel dose reductions and fewer cycles administered, despite a recent study showing a clear survival benefit with increased total number of docetaxel cycles in PCa patients. Although previous studies have attempted to improve the efficacy and reduce docetaxel toxicity through drug combination, no drug has yet demonstrated improved overall survival in clinical trial, highlighting the challenges of improving the activity of docetaxel monotherapy in PCa. Herein, we identified 15 lethality hits for which inhibition could enhance docetaxel sensitivity in PCa cells via a high-throughput kinome-wide loss-of-function screen. Further drug-gene interactions analyses identified Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) as a viable druggable target with existing experimental inhibitors and FDA-approved drugs. We demonstrated that depletion of endogenous JAK1 enhanced docetaxel-induced apoptosis in PCa cells. Furthermore, inhibition of JAK1/2 by baricitinib and ruxolitinib synergizes docetaxel sensitivity in both androgen receptor (AR)-negative DU145 and PC3 cells, but not in the AR-positive LNCaP cells. In contrast, no synergistic effects were observed in cells treated with JAK2-specific inhibitor, fedratinib, suggesting that the synergistic effects are mainly mediated through JAK1 inhibition. In conclusion, the combination therapy with JAK1 inhibitors and docetaxel could be a useful therapeutic strategy in the treatment of prostate cancers.""","""['Geetha Nalairndran', 'Ivy Chung', 'Azad Hassan Abdul Razack', 'Felicia Fei-Lei Chung', 'Ling-Wei Hii', 'Wei-Meng Lim', 'Chin King Looi', 'Chun-Wai Mai', 'Chee-Onn Leong']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Cell Mol Med""","""['The CHK1 inhibitor MU380 significantly increases the sensitivity of human docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells to gemcitabine through the induction of mitotic catastrophe.', 'Janus kinase inhibitors ruxolitinib and baricitinib impair glycoprotein-VI mediated platelet function.', 'Inhibition of JAK-STAT Signaling by Baricitinib Reduces Interferon-γ-Induced CXCL10 Production in Human Salivary Gland Ductal Cells.', 'Janus kinase inhibitors for atopic dermatitis: a promising treatment modality.', 'The safety of baricitinib in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.', 'Immune Biomarkers in Blood from Sarcoma Patients: A Pilot Study.', 'RNA interference screens discover proteases as synthetic lethal partners of PI3K inhibition in breast cancer cells.']"""

Tumors eventually progress despite castration through a number of well-characterized mechanisms; however, little is known about what determines the magnitude of response to short-term pathway inhibition.  Methods:   We evaluated a novel combination of AR-targeting therapies (degarelix, abiraterone, and bicalutamide) and noted that the objective patient response to therapy was highly variable. To investigate what was driving treatment resistance in poorly responding patients, as a secondary outcome we comprehensively characterized pre- and post-treatment samples using both whole-genome and RNA sequencing.  Results:   We find that resistance following short-term treatment differs molecularly from typical progressive castration-resistant disease, associated with transcriptional reprogramming, to a transitional epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype rather than an upregulation of AR signaling. Unexpectedly, tolerance to therapy appears to be the default state, with treatment response correlating with the prevalence of tumor cells deficient for SNAI2, a key regulator of EMT reprogramming.

Endorectal balloons (ERBs) are used to stabilize prostate movement during radiotherapy. These ERBs are usually filled with water. However, other water solutions containing elements with higher atomic numbers, such as silicon, may enable the use of PGS to monitor the radiation exposure of the rectum. Protons hitting silicon atoms emit prompt gamma rays with a specific energy of 1.78 MeV, which can be used to monitor whether the ERB is being hit. In a binary approach, we search the silicon energy peaks for every irradiated prostate region. We demonstrate this technique for both single-spot irradiation and real treatment plans. Real-time feedback based on the ERB being hit column-wise is feasible and would allow clinicians to decide whether to adapt or continue treatment.

Increasing studies show that Hhex plays a significant role in development, including anterior-posterior axis formation, vascular development and HSCs self-renewal etc. Hhex is linked to many diseases such as cancers, leukemia, and type-2 diabetes. Although Hhex is reported to inhibit cell migration and invasion of breast and prostate epithelial cells by upregulating Endoglin expression, the effect and molecular mechanism for lung cancer cell motility regulation remains elusive.  Methods:   Human non-small cell lung cancer cells and HEK293FT cells were used to investigate the molecular mechanism of Hhex regulating lung cancer cell migration by using Western blot, immunoprecipitation, wound-healing scratch assay, laser confocal.  Results:   Our data indicated that Hhex could inhibit cell migration and cell protrusion formation in lung cancer cells. In addition, Hhex inhibited CFL1 phosphorylation to keep its F-actin-severing activity. RHOGDIA was involved in Hhex-induced CFL1 phosphorylation regulation. Hhex enhanced RHOGDIA interaction with RHOA/CDC42, thus maintaining RHOA/CDC42 at an inactive form.  Conclusion:   Collectively, these data indicate that Hhex inhibited the activation of RHOA/CDC42 by enhancing interaction of RHOGDIA with RHOA/CDC42, and then RHOA/ CDC42-p-CFL1 signaling pathway was blocked. Consequently, the formation of Filopodium and Lamellipodium on the cell surface was suppressed, and thus the ability of lung cancer cells to migrate was decreased accordingly. Our findings show Hhex plays an important role in regulating migration of lung cancer cells and may provide a potential target for lung cancer therapy.

We aimed to describe the patient characteristics and estimate the progression-free survival of men with mHSPC in an Afro-Caribbean population according to the available treatment.  Patients and methods:   This was a monocentric retrospective study that consecutively included 133 men with mHSPC between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2019 at the University Hospital of Guadeloupe. The primary endpoint was a description of the patients' characteristics with a description of complications at diagnosis. The secondary endpoint was progression-free survival. Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox proportional hazard analyses were performed.  Results:   The median age at diagnosis was 71 years. The median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 147 ng/ml and 37% of patients presented with a disease-related complication at diagnosis.

Patients and methods:   One hundred and eighty-one patients who had at least one prior negative 12-core standard systematic biopsy and lesions with PI-RADS scores of 3 or higher that were detected as a result of mpMRI were included in the study. Targeted biopsy with 12-core standard systematic biopsy was performed on all patients. Clinical and pathological features of the patients were recorded. The discrimination, calibration and decision curve analysis were performed to externally validate the nomogram.  Results:   A total of 181 patients with previous negative 12-core systematic biopsies were analysed. One hundred and thirty-four patients (74%) had benign pathology. Radiological volume and PI-RADS scores of 4 and 5 were found as independent predictors of benign pathology. The area under the curve (CI 95%) was found to be 0.80 (0.73-0.87), indicating good discrimination.

Due to the importance of VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 signaling in tumor proliferation and angiogenesis, this study aimed to evaluate the protein and gene expression levels of VEGF-A and VEGFR-2 in canine prostate cancer (PC).  Methods:   We analyzed VEGF-A and VEGFR-2 expression in 87 PC samples by immunohistochemistry and quantitative-polymerase chain reaction. PC samples were graded according to the Gleason score and the immunohistochemical staining for VEGF-A and VEGFR-2 was quantified using a selected threshold from the ImageJ Software. Microvascular density was assessed by cluster of differentiation 31 staining and counting the number of positive vessels. Additionally, the homology of VEGF-A and VEGFR-2 between humans and dogs was assessed, followed by the construction of a protein structure homology model to compare the tertiary structures of these proteins in both species.  Results:   Negative to weakly positive expression levels of VEGF-A and VEGFR-2 were observed in the epithelial cells of the normal prostate (NP) and prostatic hyperplasia samples. In contrast, the canine proliferative atrophy and PC samples exhibited higher VEGF-A (p < .0001) and VEGFR-2 (p < .0001) compared to NP. Moreover, positive correlations between the expression levels of VEGF-A and VEGFR-2 (Spearman's coefficient (r) = .68, p = .013) and the expression levels of VEGF-A and VEGFR-2 proteins (r = .8, p < .0001) were also observed in the NP samples. Additionally, the patients with PC exhibiting higher VEGFR-2 expression levels experienced a shorter survival period (p = .0372). Furthermore, we found an association between the microvascular density and overall survival. Dogs with a higher number of vessels showed a shorter survival time. We further demonstrated that the VEGF-A and VEGFR-2 exhibited high homology between humans and dogs, and identified their protein structures in both species.  Conclusions:   In conclusion, VEGFR-2 appears to be an independent prognostic factor in animals with PC. VEGF-A and VEGFR-2 are highly conserved between humans and dogs, which can be investigated further in future cross-species studies to explore their therapeutic applications.""","""['Antonio Fernando Leis-Filho', 'Patricia deFaria Lainetti', 'Priscila Emiko Kobayashi', 'Chiara Palmieri', 'Renée Laufer Amorim', 'Carlos Eduardo Fonseca-Alves']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Differential expression of VEGF ligands and receptors in prostate cancer.', 'Stromal expression of VEGF-A and VEGFR-2 in prostate tissue is associated with biochemical and clinical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Immunohistochemical expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor associated with tumor cell proliferation in canine cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and trichoepitheliomas.', 'Intracranial meningiomas, the VEGF-A pathway, and peritumoral brain oedema.', 'Vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptor system: physiological functions in angiogenesis and pathological roles in various diseases.', 'Comparative oncology: overcoming human cancer through companion animal studies.', 'Comparative Pathobiology of Canine and Human Prostate Cancer: State of the Art and Future Directions.', 'P-Glycoprotein and Androgen Receptor Expression Reveals Independence of Canine Prostate Cancer from Androgen Hormone Stimulation.']"""

We sought to examine rates and trends in stage-specific prostate cancer incidence by age and race/ethnicity using the most recent data obtained from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program.  Methods:   SEER*Stat version 8.3.6 was used to analyze annual prostate cancer incidence rates between 2000 and 2017 according to the SEER summary stage, age group, and race/ethnicity group. Incidence rates per 100,000 men were calculated and age-adjusted to 2000 US standard population. Annual percentage change (APC) was performed to identify the trend in prostate cancer incidence.  Results:   Between 2008 and 2012, trends in incidence of overall and localized prostate cancer significantly declined in comparison with between 2000 and 2007 (APC, -5.4 and -6.0, respectively). However, there was an increase in the incidence rate of both overall and localized prostate cancer from 2014 to 2017 (43.3-46 and 34-34.9 per 100,000 men, respectively). The incidence of regional prostate cancer significantly increased between 2013 and 2017 (5.9-6.8 per 100,000 men; APC, 4.3). Distant disease incidence increased continually between 2008 and 2012 (2.9-3.3 per 100,000 men; APC, 2.3) and between 2013 and 2017 (3.4-4.3 per 100,000 men; APC, 6.0). In addition, these increases in incidence occurred in men of all stratified age and race/ethnicity groups, except for men aged <50 years and American Indian/Alaska Native men.  Conclusion:   This study demonstrates that the longer-term effects of USPSTF recommendations against PSA screening may have resulted in a reversal of downtrend in prostate cancer incidence, as incidence rates of overall and localized prostate cancer gradually increased from 2014 to 2017. Meanwhile, the trend in stage migration toward advanced disease increased incrementally.""","""['Yubo Cao', 'Wei Zhang', 'Yue Li', 'Jia Fu', 'Hongyuan Li', 'Xiulin Li', 'Xue Gao', 'Kaiyu Zhang', 'Sa Liu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Prostate Cancer Incidence and PSA Testing Patterns in Relation to USPSTF Screening Recommendations.', 'Prostate cancer incidence across stage, NCCN risk groups, and age before and after USPSTF Grade D recommendations against prostate-specific antigen screening in 2012.', 'Variations in Age-Adjusted Prostate Cancer Incidence Rates by Race and Ethnicity After Changes in Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening Recommendation.', 'The effect of the USPSTF PSA screening recommendation on prostate cancer incidence patterns in the USA.', ""Impact of the United States Preventive Services Task Force 'D' recommendation on prostate cancer screening and staging."", 'The diagnosis and treatment of castrate-sensitive oligometastatic prostate cancer: A review.', 'Application of aptamer functionalized nanomaterials in targeting therapeutics of typical tumors.', 'Prostate cancer disparities among American Indians and Alaskan Natives in the United States.']"""

We assessed the associations of these PRS with breast and prostate cancer risks for male BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variant carriers.  Methods:   483 BRCA1 and 1318 BRCA2 European ancestry male carriers were available from the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 (CIMBA). A 147-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) prostate cancer PRS (PRSPC) and a 313-SNP breast cancer PRS were evaluated. There were 3 versions of the breast cancer PRS, optimized to predict overall (PRSBC), estrogen receptor (ER)-negative (PRSER-), or ER-positive (PRSER+) breast cancer risk.  Results:   PRSER+ yielded the strongest association with breast cancer risk. The odds ratios (ORs) per PRSER+ standard deviation estimates were 1.40 (95% confidence interval [CI] =1.07 to 1.83) for BRCA1 and 1.33 (95% CI = 1.16 to 1.52) for BRCA2 carriers. PRSPC was associated with prostate cancer risk for BRCA1 (OR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.28 to 2.33) and BRCA2 (OR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.34 to 1.91) carriers. The estimated breast cancer odds ratios were larger after adjusting for female relative breast cancer family history. By age 85 years, for BRCA2 carriers, the breast cancer risk varied from 7.7% to 18.4% and prostate cancer risk from 34.1% to 87.6% between the 5th and 95th percentiles of the PRS distributions.  Conclusions:   Population-based prostate and female breast cancer PRS are associated with a wide range of absolute breast and prostate cancer risks for male BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers.

To improve this prediction, we created a comorbidity index based on filled prescriptions intended to be used in registry-based studies.  Materials and methods:   In a population-based cohort of men with CPRC a drug comorbidity index (DCI-CRPC) was calculated based on prescriptions filled during a 365-day period before the date of CRPC diagnosis to predict mortality. Five risk categories for men with CRPC were defined based on PSA kinetics. Mortality rates were described by Kaplan-Meier curves. The predictive ability of the DCI-CRPC was compared in univariable models to that of the original DCI, derived from men in the general population, and to that of the Charlson Comorbidity Index.  Results:   In 1,885 men with CRPC the median overall survival ranged from 3.0 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.8 to 3.4) in the first tertile of the DCI-CRPC, to 1.0 year (95% CI 0.9 to 1.1) in the third tertile of the DCI-CRPC. The index had higher discriminative ability (C-index 0.667) than the Charlson Comorbidity Index (C-index 0.508). The discriminative ability of the DCI-CRPC was highest in the subgroup with least aggressive cancer (C-index 0.651) and lowest in men with most aggressive cancer (C-index 0.618). The performance of the DCI-CRPC was comparable to that of the original DCI.

In the presence of M.SssI, the RCA process can be triggered, causing the augmentation of the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) at the tail of the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and the ssDNA can be hybridized with numerous DNA probes labeled with Raman reporters in the next steps. Afterwards, the resultant ssDNA can be modified to the Au@SiO2 array substrate with the SERS enhancement factor of 7.49 × 106. The substrate was synthesized by using a monolayer SiO2 array to pick up the Au nanoparticle (AuNP) array and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation showed its excellent SERS effect. Particularly, the developed biosensor displayed a significant sensitivity with a broad detection range covering from 0.005 to 50 U mL-1, and the limits of detection (LODs) in PBS buffer and human serum were 2.37 × 10-4 U mL-1 and 2.51 × 10-4 U mL-1, respectively. Finally, in order to verify the feasibility of its clinical application, the serum samples of healthy subjects and breast cancer, prostate cancer, gastric cancer and cervical cancer patients were analyzed, and the reliability of the results was also confirmed by western blot (WB) experiments.

This study investigates whether automated treatment planning of prostate SBRT with focal boosting on the O-ring linac could generate plans that are of similar quality as those obtained through manual planning on clinical C-arm linacs.  Methods:   For 20 men with prostate cancer, reference treatment plans were generated on a TrueBeam STx C-arm linac with HD120 MLC and a TrueBeam C-arm linac with Millennium 120 MLC using 6 MV flattened dual arc VMAT. Manual planning on the Halcyon fast-rotating O-ring linac was performed using 6 MV FFF dual arc VMAT (HA2-DL10) and triple arc VMAT (HA3-DL10) to investigate the performance of the dual-layer MLC system. Automated planning was performed for triple arc VMAT on the Halcyon linac (ET3-DL10) using the automated planning algorithms of Ethos Treatment Planning. The prescribed dose was 35 Gy to the prostate and 30 Gy to the seminal vesicles in five fractions. The iso-toxic focal boost to the intraprostatic tumor nodule(s) was aimed to receive up to 50 Gy. Plan deliverability was verified using portal image dosimetry measurements.  Results:   Compared to the C-arm linacs, ET3-DL10 shows increased seminal vesicles PTV coverage (D99% ) and reduced high-dose spillage to the bladder (V37Gy ) and urethra (D0.035cc ) but this came at the cost of increased high-dose spillage to the rectum (V38Gy ) and a higher intermediate dose spillage (D2cm). No statistically significant differences were found when benchmarking HA2-DL10 and HA3-DL10 with the C-arm linacs. All plans passed the patient-specific QA tolerance limit.  Conclusions:   Automated planning of prostate SBRT with focal boosting on the fast-rotating O-ring linac is feasible and achieves similar plan quality as those obtained on clinical C-arm linacs using manual planning.""","""['Robin De Roover', 'Wouter Crijns', 'Kenneth Poels', 'Bertrand Dewit', 'Cédric Draulans', 'Karin Haustermans', 'Tom Depuydt']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Volumetric modulated arc therapy of head-and-neck cancer on a fast-rotating O-ring linac: Plan quality and delivery time comparison with a C-arm linac.', 'Prostate SBRT using O-Ring Halcyon Linac - Plan quality, delivery efficiency, and accuracy.', 'Clinical validation of ring-mounted halcyon linac for lung SBRT: comparison to SBRT-dedicated C-arm linac treatments.', 'Place of Linacs in extracranial stereotactic radiotherapy: Are they now equivalent to Cyberknife®?.', 'The beginning of linac radiosurgery at the JCRT.']"""

AR splice variant 7 (ARv7) is the most commonly observed isoform and strongly correlates with resistance to second-generation anti-androgens. Despite this clinical evidence, the interplay between ARv7 and the highly expressed full-length AR (ARfl) remains unclear. In this work, we show that ARfl/ARv7 heterodimers readily form in the nucleus via an intermolecular N/C interaction that brings the four termini of the proteins in close proximity. Combining fluorescence resonance energy transfer and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, we demonstrate that these heterodimers undergo conformational changes following DNA binding, indicating dynamic nuclear receptor interaction. Although transcriptionally active, ARv7 can only form short-term interactions with DNA at highly accessible high-occupancy ARfl binding sites. Dimerization with ARfl does not affect ARv7 binding dynamics, suggesting that DNA binding occupancy is determined by the individual protein monomers and not the homodimer or heterodimer complex. Overall, these biophysical studies reveal detailed properties of ARv7 dynamics as both a homodimer or heterodimer with ARfl.""","""['Fatma Özgün', 'Zeynep Kaya', 'Tunç Morova', 'Bart Geverts', 'Tsion E Abraham', 'Adriaan B Houtsmuller', 'Martin E van Royen', 'Nathan A Lack']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Cell Sci""","""['Androgen receptor splice variant 7 functions independently of the full length receptor in prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen Receptor and Its Splicing Variant 7 Expression in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells and in Circulating Tumor Cells in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'ARv7 Represses Tumor-Suppressor Genes in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor splice variants and prostate cancer: From bench to bedside.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A compendium of Androgen Receptor Variant 7 target genes and their role in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'A novel inhibitor of ARfl and ARv7 induces protein degradation to overcome enzalutamide resistance in advanced prostate cancer.']"""

Objective:   The aim of this study is to investigate and iteratively refine the acceptability and usability of a web-based exercise intervention (ExerciseGuide) for men with metastatic prostate cancer and determine how well individuals can replicate the video-based exercise prescription.  Methods:   A laboratory-based multi-methods design was used, incorporating questionnaires, think-aloud tests, interviews, and movement screening among 11 men aged 63 to 82 years with metastatic prostate cancer. Overall, 9 participants were undergoing androgen deprivation therapy, and 2 were completing chemotherapy. Data were collected in two waves, with changes made for quality improvement after participant 5.  Results:   The intervention's usability score was deemed moderate overall but improved after modifications (from 60, SD 2.9 to 69.6, SD 2.2 out of 100). Overall, the participants found the intervention acceptable, with scores improving from wave 1 (24.2, SD 1.1 out of 30) to wave 2 (26.3, SD 2.1 out of 30). The personalized multimodal exercise prescription and computer-tailored education were seen as valuable. After wave 1, website navigation videos were added, medical terminology was simplified, and a telehealth component was included after expert real-time telehealth support was requested. Wave 2 changes included the added variety for aerobic exercise modes, reduced computer-tailoring question loads, and improved consistency of style and grammar. Finally, the participants could replicate the resistance exercise videos to a satisfactory level as judged by the movement screen; however, additional technique cueing within the videos is recommended to address safety concerns.  Conclusions:   The acceptability and usability of ExerciseGuide were deemed satisfactory. Various problems were identified and resolved. Notably, the participants requested the inclusion of personalized expert support through telehealth. The resistance training algorithms were shown to provide appropriate content safely, and the users could replicate the exercise technique unaided to a satisfactory level.

For transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided HDR prostate brachytherapy, image fusion with a magnetic resonance image (MRI) can be performed to make use of its soft-tissue contrast. The MIM treatment planning system has recently introduced image registration specifically for HDR prostate brachytherapy and has incorporated a Predictive Fusion workflow, which allows clinicians to attempt to compensate for differences in patient positioning between imaging modalities. In this study, we investigate the accuracy of the MIM algorithms for MRI-TRUS fusion, including the Predictive Fusion workflow.  Materials and methods:   A radiation oncologist contoured the prostate gland on both TRUS and MRI. Four registration methodologies to fuse the MRI and the TRUS images were considered: rigid registration (RR), contour-based (CB) deformable registration, Predictive Fusion followed by RR (pfRR), and Predictive Fusion followed by CB deformable registration (pfCB). Registrations were compared using the mean distance to agreement and the Dice similarity coefficient for the prostate as contoured on TRUS and the registered MRI prostate contour.  Results:   Twenty patients treated with HDR prostate brachytherapy at our center were included in this retrospective evaluation. For the cohort, mean distance to agreement was 2.1 ± 0.8 mm, 0.60 ± 0.08 mm, 2.0 ± 0.5 mm, and 0.59 ± 0.06 mm for RR, CB, pfRR, and pfCB, respectively. Dice similarity coefficients were 0.80 ± 0.05, 0.93 ± 0.02, 0.81 ± 0.03, and 0.93 ± 0.01 for RR, CB, pfRR, and pfCB, respectively. The inclusion of the Predictive Fusion workflow did not significantly improve the quality of the registration.

Methods and results:   MicroRNA expressions were determined by qPCR. MTT was used for cell viability analysis and immunohistochemistry was performed for Bax/Bcl-2 staining. ELISA was used to measure MMP2/9 levels. Wound healing assay was used for the evaluation of cell migration. Notably, expression levels of miR-125b-5p, miR-145-5p and miR-221-3p were significantly reduced in prostate cancer patients as compared to BPH patients. Moreover, ectopic expression of miR-125b-5p, miR-145-5p and miR-221-3p resulted in significant inhibition of cell proliferation and altered cell morphology. Also, expression level of Bax protein was increased while Bcl-2 level was reduced in cells treated with miR-125b-5p, miR-145-5p and miR-221-3p mimics. Enhanced expression of miR-125b-5p, miR-145-5p and miR-221-3p was also significantly altered the expression of caspase 3 and 8 levels. In addition, MMP9 levels were significantly reduced in cells ectopically expressing miR-221-3p. All miRNA mimics significantly interfered with the migration of prostate cancer cells.

We investigated the potential causal association between plasma cortisol and risk of overall and common site-specific cancers using Mendelian randomisation.  Methods:   Three genetic variants associated with morning plasma cortisol levels at the genome-wide significance level (P < 5 × 10-8) in the Cortisol Network consortium were used as genetic instruments. Summary-level genome-wide association study data for the cancer outcomes were obtained from large-scale cancer consortia, the UK Biobank, and the FinnGen consortium. Two-sample Mendelian randomisation analyses were performed using the fixed-effects inverse-variance weighted method. Estimates across data sources were combined using meta-analysis.  Results:   A standard deviation increase in genetically predicted plasma cortisol was associated with increased risk of endometrial cancer (odds ratio 1.50, 95% confidence interval 1.13-1.99; P = 0.005). There was no significant association between genetically predicted plasma cortisol and risk of other common site-specific cancers, including breast, ovarian, prostate, colorectal, lung, or malignant skin cancer, or overall cancer.  Conclusions:   These results indicate that elevated plasma cortisol levels may increase the risk of endometrial cancer but not other cancers.

Its application can be extended to targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT). In this study, we characterize the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of [68Ga]PSMA-11 in PSMA-positive and negative (22Rv1 and PC3, respectively) tumor-bearing mice and subsequently estimated its internal radiation dosimetry via voxel-level dosimetry using a dedicated Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the absorbed dose in the tumor directly. Consequently, this approach overcomes the drawbacks of the conventional organ-level (or phantom-based) method. The kidneys and urinary bladder both showed substantial accumulation of [68Ga]PSMA-11 without exhibiting a washout phase during the study. For the tumor, a peak concentration of 4.5 ± 0.7 %ID/g occurred 90 min after [68Ga]PSMA-11 injection. The voxel- and organ-level methods both determined that the highest absorbed dose occurred in the kidneys (0.209 ± 0.005 Gy/MBq and 0.492 ± 0.059 Gy/MBq, respectively). Using voxel-level dosimetry, the absorbed dose in the tumor was estimated as 0.024 ± 0.003 Gy/MBq. The biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of [68Ga]PSMA-11 in various organs of subcutaneous prostate cancer xenograft model mice were consistent with reported data for prostate cancer patients.

Thus, a better understanding of the critical dependencies of PCa may enable more feasible therapeutic approaches to the dilemma. We performed a kinome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 screen and identified cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12) as being conservatively required for PCa cell survival. Suppression of CDK12 by the covalent inhibitor THZ531 led to an obvious anti-PCa effect. Mechanistically, THZ531 downregulated AR signaling and preferentially repressed a distinct class of CDK12 inhibition-sensitive transcripts (CDK12-ISTs), including prostate lineage-specific genes, and contributed to cellular survival processes. Integration of the super-enhancer (SE) landscape and CDK12-ISTs indicated a group of potential PCa oncogenes, further conferring the sensitivity of PCa cells to CDK12 inhibition. Importantly, THZ531 strikingly synergized with multiple AR antagonists. The synergistic effect may be driven by attenuated H3K27ac signaling on AR targets and an intensive SE-associated apoptosis pathway. In conclusion, we highlight the validity of CDK12 as a druggable target in PCa.

Here, we present safety, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and preliminary efficacy data from a phase I study (trial registration ID: NCT01946074) of dilpacimab in patients with advanced solid tumors. Eligible patients (≥18 years) received dilpacimab intravenously on days 1 and 15 in 28-day cycles at escalating dose levels (range, 1.25-7.5 mg/kg) until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. As of August 2018, 55 patients with solid tumors were enrolled in the dilpacimab monotherapy dose-escalation and dose-expansion cohorts. The most common treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) included hypertension (60.0%), headache (30.9%), and fatigue (21.8%). A TRAE of special interest was gastrointestinal perforation, occurring in 2 patients (3.6%; 1 with ovarian and 1 with prostate cancer) and resulting in 1 death. The PK of dilpacimab showed a half-life ranging from 4.9 to 9.5 days, and biomarker analysis demonstrated that the drug bound to both VEGF and DLL4 targets. The recommended phase II dose for dilpacimab monotherapy was established as 3.75 mg/kg, primarily on the basis of tolerability through multiple cycles. A partial response was achieved in 10.9% of patients (including 4 of 16 patients with ovarian cancer).

Materials and methods:   We conducted a prospective cohort study of 1,920 men with Gleason 3+4 adenocarcinoma of the prostate who received brachytherapy (BT) or BT and a median of 4 months of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Separate multivariable Fine and Gray competing risks regression models among men treated with BT or BT and ADT were used to assess whether percentage of positive biopsies (PPB), cT2b-T2c stage, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 10.1-20.0 ng/ml, and age >70 years (median) were associated with risk of PCSM after adjustment for comorbidity.  Results:   After median follow-up of 7.8 years, 284 men (14.8%) had died (31 from prostate cancer). For BT alone, increasing PPB, PSA of 10.1-20.0 vs. 4.0-10.0 ng/mL, and age >70 vs. ≤70 were significantly associated with increased risk of PCSM (adjusted hazard ratio 1.015, 95% confidence interval 1.000-1.031, P = 0.048; 5.55, 2.01-15.29, P<0.001; and 3.66, 1.16-11.56, P = 0.03, respectively).

However, the cytotoxic effects of GNRs have not been fully explored.  Objective:   Therefore, the main objective of this study was to determine the selective cytotoxic effect of GNRs towards several human tumor cell lines.  Methods:   To address this issue, three sizes of GNRs (10-nm, 25-nm, and 50-nm) were tested against two human tumor cell lines, namely, human hepatoma HepG2 and human prostate PC3 cancer cells. As GNRs are usually stored in soft tissues inside living bodies, we also tested the effect of GNRs on murine splenocyte viability. To determine if the GNRs displayed selective cytotoxicity towards cancer cells, active GNRs with the size showing the least cytotoxicity to splenocytes were then tested against a panel of 11 human tumor cell lines and two human non-tumor cell lines.  Results:   Our results showed that the most cytotoxic size of GNRs is 10-nm, followed by the 25-nm GNRs, while the 50-nm GNRs did not show a significant effect. In addition, the 25-nm GNRs were the least cytotoxic to splenocytes when tested for 24 and 48 h. These GNRs showed a selective cytotoxic effect to prostate cancer PC3 cells with median inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 8.3 ± 0.37 μM, myeloblastic leukemia HL60 cells (IC50 = 19.7 ± 0.89 μM), cervical cancer HeLa cells (IC50 = 24.6 ± 0.37 μM), renal adenocarcinoma 786.0 cells (IC50 = 27.34 ± 0.6 μM), and hepatoma HepG2 cells (IC50 = 27.79 ± 0.03 μM) when compared to the effect on the non-tumor human cells; skin fibroblast BJ cell line (IC50 = 40.13 ± 0.7 μM) or epithelial breast MCF10A cells (IC50 = 33.2 ± 0.89 μM). High selectivity indices (SIs) were observed in GNRs-treated PC3 and HL60 cells with values ranging from 1.69 to 4.83, whereas moderate SIs were observed in GNRs-treated HeLa, 786.0, and HepG2 cells with values ranging from 1.19 to 1.63. Other cells did not show a similar selective effect, including human laryngeal HEp2 cells, colon HCT116, metastatic renal adenocarcinoma ACHN cells, and human breast cancer cells (MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 cells). The effect of GNRs was confirmed using the colony formation assay and the effect was found to be cell cycle-specific. Finally, it was shown that laser treatment could potentiate the cytotoxic effect of the 25-nm GNRs.  Conclusion:   GNRs are selective cytotoxic agents and they have the potential to act as candidate anticancer agents.""","""['Mohamed El Gendy', 'Michael Weinfeld', 'Ahmed Abdoon']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Anticancer Agents Med Chem""","""['The impact of size and surface ligand of gold nanorods on liver cancer accumulation and photothermal therapy in the second near-infrared window.', 'Cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, and inflammation in human Hep G2 liver epithelial cells following exposure to gold nanorods.', 'Design and synthesis of novel 7-ethyl-10-fluoro-20-O-(cinnamic acid ester)-camptothecin derivatives as potential high selectivity and low toxicity topoisomerase I inhibitors for hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'A personalized and long-acting local therapeutic platform combining photothermal therapy and chemotherapy for the treatment of multidrug-resistant colon tumor.', 'Development of gold nanorods for cancer treatment.']"""
